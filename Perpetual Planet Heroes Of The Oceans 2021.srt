3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,439
The ocean is Earth's life
support system.

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,160
No Ocean,
No Us.

5
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:25,879
My name is Sylvia Earle.

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:31,440
For most of my life,
I've had the joy of exploring
the sea,

7
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,920
studying the living systems
that make our lives possible.

8
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,880
But what I've seen in mylifetime is slipping away.

9
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:50,759
It's now a race against time
to find solutions.

10
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,079
Today, a new generation ofheroes are showing us what needs to be
done

11
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,560
to restore health to the ocean,

12
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,400
creating a perpetual planet

13
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,879
for generations to come.

14
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:24,040
Fantastic.

15
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,400
This is where I first fell inlove with the ocean as a kid.

16
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:00,040
It was here
that I first breathed air
underwater.

17
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,599
And for me,
it was transformative.

18
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:08,120
I thought,
“This is going to be so great,

19
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:12,039
I can get to see the fish
and watch them and see what they
do.”

20
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,080
And what happened was the fish
came over
and started looking at me.

21
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:18,840
I thought, “Wait a minute,

22
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,719
it's supposed to be
the other way round, right?”

23
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,520
Since I first breathed air under
water,

24
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,479
I've been a part of the greatestera of exploration

25
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,080
in the history of humankind.

26
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,560
I've lived underwater
for weeks at a time.

27
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:40,439
<i>She has witnessed first-hand</i>

28
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,000
<i>parts of our planet
most could barely imagine.</i>

29
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,439
I've helped design and build
submersibles

30
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,479
to explore further and deeper
than ever before.

31
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,039
For the first time,

32
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,400
a woman walks the seafloor
beyond 1,000 feet.

33
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:01,000
It's a pleasure
to introduce a scientist, an
engineer,

34
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,199
a teacher, and an explorer.

35
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,319
And founded organisations
to explore and protect the sea.

36
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,240
Her Deepness, Dr Sylvia Earle.

37
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,759
But this era of discovery
has been accompanied by immense
loss.

38
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,520
If we continue business as
usual,
we're in real trouble.

39
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,560
We used to think the ocean was
too vast
for humans to harm.

40
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,520
We were wrong.

41
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,520
We've squandered
the treasures of nature,

42
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:39,439
pushing the ocean
to the brink of collapse.

43
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,280
But I still have great hope.

44
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:54,919
Across the globe, a network ofscientists are building on my life's
mission -

45
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
to save the ocean.

46
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:02,800
For me, Sylvia Earle is an
inspiration.

47
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,319
We all are following in her
footsteps.

48
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:11,719
She's allowed for so many morepeople from my generation to move
forward

49
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,280
and advance their work.

50
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,639
Their pioneering work
has taken our knowledge

51
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,120
to new heights - and depths -
of understanding.

52
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,279
Now we know what previousgenerations could not know.

53
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,800
We're entering
another mass extinction,

54
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:31,600
we're losing species
at an alarming rate.

55
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,040
We are the scientists
who know what's going on

56
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,360
and it's our responsibility
to make people aware

57
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:45,319
for the sake of the planet
and our own future.

58
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,519
Together, they are creating
a global movement

59
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,839
and we all can be a part of it.

60
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:59,319
Protecting the ocean
as if our lives depend on it.

61
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,720
Because they do.

62
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,279
When I first began exploring,

63
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,480
I marvelled at the abundance oflife that thrives in healthy coral
reefs.

64
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:26,839
But today, coral reef systems
around the world are
disappearing.

65
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,360
This is about as bad as it gets.

66
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,600
It was like looking at the fae
of climate change. There it is.

67
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,240
Reefs are dying,
and this is evidence of it right
here.

68
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:47,040
If we don't act now,

69
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,600
coral reefs may be gone
by the end of the century.

70
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,120
Seen from space,

71
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,600
the Great Barrier Reef
is the largest living structure
on Earth.

72
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:15,120
The corals here are among
the most diverse in the world.

73
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,839
But in recent years,

74
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,279
the impacts of climate change
have wiped out up to 30%.

75
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,639
Coral Biologist Dr Emma Campwitnessed these tragic events first-hand.

76
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:52,120
I feel that I have aresponsibility to speak up for coral reefs

77
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:54,160
that's been my area
of passion and research

78
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,360
and do what I can
to protect and guard that
ecosystem.

79
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:04,959
Climate change
and other human activities

80
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,759
are destroying coral reefs
globally.

81
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:17,480
Warmer, more acidic, low oxygenseawater is threatening their very
existence.

82
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,560
Whilst we are rapidly changing
the environment,

83
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,160
we're, with that, learning howcorals can or cannot survive with that
change.

84
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,959
To help save what's left,

85
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,720
Emma and her team have set up
the first multispecies coral
nursery here

86
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,800
to restore coral abundance and
diversity.

87
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,199
Coral fragments are carefullytransplanted onto metal frames.

88
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,240
This has been really successful.

89
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:08,800
We've had, I think now, over
14,000
corals out planted in just under
a year.

90
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,199
This method of transplantingcoral cuttings has already been
adopted

91
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:17,800
on other reefs around the world.

92
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:26,639
The only long-term solution to
save corals
is mitigating climate change.

93
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,639
Until then,
these coral nurseries help buy
reefs time.

94
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:42,279
A few years ago, Emma and herteam made another extraordinary
breakthrough

95
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,559
in the fight to save coral
reefs.

96
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:50,320
They found corals thriving
in extreme conditions.

97
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:55,039
One area where we found corals
surviving,
where we wouldn't normally look,

98
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,240
was in mangrove lagoons.

99
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:05,200
It's unusual because theconditions are warmer, more acidic

100
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,120
and have lower oxygen.

101
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,159
That's what we're predicting tointensify under climate change.

102
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:17,320
Finding these corals
that have some enhanced
resilience

103
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,120
gives me some much-needed hope

104
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,039
that we can have at least somecorals into the future.

105
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,639
These ground-breakingdiscoveries are already being shared

106
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,039
with scientists around the
world.

107
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,960
Working together to future-proof
this precious ecosystem

108
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:44,639
for generations to come.

109
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:54,519
I want to be able to say to mychildren and the future generations

110
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,000
that I did everything that Icould to try to conserve these systems

111
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:03,320
and to try and motivate and
educate,
and encourage those around us,

112
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:06,759
to also conserve these
ecosystems,
so that they aren't lost,

113
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,440
so it wasn't a privilege
that just us were able to
experience.

114
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:29,879
Today, the impact of climatechange is being felt everywhere on
earth.

115
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:40,799
Nowhere is this more apparent
than in the frozen parts of the
planet.

116
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:48,320
Here in Antarctica,

117
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,519
melting ice is opening up
this once pristine environment,

118
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,600
exposing marine life
to unexpected forms of pollution

119
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:03,519
we're just beginning to
understand.

120
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,840
It's beautiful, isn't it,
just to listen to nature.

121
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,440
The more diverse the soundscape
is,
the more it tells us about its
health.

122
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,759
Bio-acoustician Prof MichelAndre has developed pioneering
technology,

123
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,759
unlocking the sound of the
ocean.

124
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:56,360
Revealing a vast soundscape oflife undetectable to human ears.

125
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,639
Light doesn't penetrate
more than a few metres below the
surface,

126
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,399
so the only way the inhabitants
of the sea have to communicate,

127
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,559
to orientate, to get
information,
is through sounds.

128
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:25,039
Whales produce these rumble
sounds,
similar to what you hear with an
elephant.

129
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:32,720
This very low frequency rumble.
Something like... "Brr."

130
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,000
And it allows these whales
to communicate at very long
distances,

131
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,200
sometimes hundreds of
kilometres.

132
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,519
But as Michel learned to listen
to these voices,

133
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,399
he also discovered
they are drowned out by human
noise.

134
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:00,519
Contaminating this channel of communication

135
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,000
with noise from human activity,
in particular shipping.

136
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:07,320
If we prevent them
from exchange information,

137
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:09,720
we condemn them to death.

138
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,559
In the last 50 years,

139
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,080
noise in most of the ocean
has doubled every decade.

140
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,039
Shipping, industrial fishing
and surveying for fossil fuel

141
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,200
has dramatically intensified.

142
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,639
And it's not just killing the
mammals.

143
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:41,600
10 years ago,
we made a shocking discovery.

144
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:45,360
It wasn't just large marine
mammals,
like whales and dolphins,

145
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,080
that were impacted by noise
pollution.

146
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,039
Thousands of invertebratespecies may suffer and die from it.

147
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,159
We were totally surprised,
we could not believe it.

148
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:03,600
You feel responsible not only
to demonstrate that there is an
effect

149
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:06,840
but to propose to society
a solution for that.

150
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,600
To tackle the impact of noise
pollution,

151
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:16,679
Michel has developed technology

152
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:20,279
that listens live
to the sounds of the sea.

153
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,120
This is the first time,
this is a new device,

154
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,639
it is a prototype that wespecially designed for this expedition

155
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,960
and this little baby is going torecord the sound of the Antarctic.

156
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,039
This autonomous buoy
transmits data in real time,

157
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,000
from one of the last places onEarth with zero noise pollution.

158
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:47,759
It comes with this bittersweet
feeling

159
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,919
that we might not be able to do
it again
in the future.

160
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,240
This technology will become apart of a global network

161
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,639
of listening stations around the
world.

162
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,519
Known as LIDO -
or Listen to the Deep Ocean -

163
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,080
it offers the first truly globalpicture of ocean noise and its effects.

164
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:17,159
The beauty of this technology
is that it is listening to the
ocean

165
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,879
24 hours a day, every day,
every month, every year.

166
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:30,840
The ability to listen isrevealing exactly where we must reduce
noise -

167
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:32,960
protecting vital habitats.

168
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,440
I hope that this listeningstation that we are developing

169
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,000
and deploying around the world

170
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,720
will help many people
to hear the message.

171
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:56,200
My feeling is not fear.
My feeling is, on the contrary,

172
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:59,399
I believe that what we are doing
is bringing a solution,

173
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,320
is bringing something that
the next generation will know
how to use.

174
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:08,679
This technology
that was born in the ocean

175
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,639
is now monitoring biodiversity
on the land,

176
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:18,519
revealing the impact of humanactivity on wildlife around the world.

177
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,240
Undersea noise pollution is
like a death of a thousand cuts.

178
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,080
But it's just one of manyproblems facing the ocean.

179
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,879
In my lifetime,
industrial fishing has
eliminated 90%

180
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,000
of many different species
of wild ocean animals.

181
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,759
Some of earth's most majesticcreatures are being pushed to extinction.

182
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,799
But with the right protection,
species can recover,

183
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,960
from the smallest squid and
shrimp,

184
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,480
to the biggest fish in the sea.

185
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,119
The first time I saw a whale
shark,

186
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:26,079
it was like a bus underwater
coming towards me and I was in
awe.

187
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:33,519
You almost feel insignificant
because of their sheer size.

188
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:38,200
And yet, these animals that aremassive and they've been around forever,

189
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:39,359
are endangered.

190
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,839
Marine Biologist Dr Brad Norman
and his colleagues

191
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:56,599
have helped develop technology
to monitor
this highly elusive giant of the
deep.

192
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:05,640
Their numbers have declined
by more than 50% over the last
75 years.

193
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:09,680
Driven to the brink ofextinction by humans

194
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:12,319
due to hunting and ship
collisions.

195
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,960
If we do nothing now,

196
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:18,920
there is a big risk
we're going to lose this species
forever.

197
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,119
This is not something
that I want to happen on my
watch.

198
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:28,160
<i>Magellen, this is Shark Bay
Watch, over.</i>

199
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,440
Yes, this is Magellen.
Go ahead, over.

200
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:34,000
<i>We've got a sighting of a whaleshark off the north west corner.</i>

201
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,160
Just keep an eye on him,
we'll be there as quick as we
can.

202
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,160
Like many threatened species,

203
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,200
in order to protect them,
we need to understand them.

204
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:49,799
We want to know
if climate change is having an
effect,

205
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,200
how it's going to affect theanimals in their movements.

206
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,240
To answer this vital question,

207
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:04,880
Brad and his team
are using electronic tags

208
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,319
to track whale shark movements
and monitor their behaviour.

209
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,440
Tagging the biggest fish in thesea is not that easy.

210
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,480
You have to be very calm.

211
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:32,759
The tag is clamped harmlessly
onto the dorsal fin.

212
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:42,519
This reveals unique insights
into what they're doing

213
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,160
when they're out of sight.

214
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,119
We've recorded whale sharks
moving along the WA coast

215
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,759
all the way north to Indonesia

216
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:53,759
and all the way south below
Perth.

217
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,880
Well, that's great, guys.
Well done. Perfect.

218
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,000
Along with tagging,

219
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:12,440
Brad and his team have alsodeveloped a pioneering photo monitoring
system.

220
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:18,720
The spots on the skin
of each whale shark are unique.

221
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:23,920
We can identify individuals
similar to a fingerprint in
humans.

222
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:27,519
By photographing the unique
pattern,

223
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:30,680
Brad can track the returnmigration of individuals.

224
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,720
Anyone with an underwater camera
can now play a part

225
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,720
in helping
to conserve whale sharks
globally.

226
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:54,559
By adapting an algorithm NASAuses to map stars in the night sky,

227
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,880
Brad and his colleagues
have produced a database

228
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,160
with over 75,000 sightings
from 54 countries.

229
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:08,720
To be able to break new ground

230
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:13,680
on something that was so big

231
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:19,200
and so amazing,
yet so little known,

232
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,440
it was a dream come true really.

233
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,960
And this star mapping technology
is also being adapted

234
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:33,160
to help other species
on the edge of extinction.

235
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:44,880
We need to keep learning,
and as technology is advancing,

236
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,079
we have so many more tools
to help our understanding

237
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,480
of whale sharks,
of their environment,

238
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,880
and ultimately,
how we're going to protect them.

239
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,839
Saving the ocean now depends
on scientists from all
disciplines

240
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,519
and nations working together.

241
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,519
We are fighting a battle on many
fronts.

242
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:17,039
And to really win,
we must keep exploring.

243
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:23,079
There's still so much about theocean that we have no idea about.

244
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,519
The deep ocean, we know less
about that
than we do about space.

245
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:38,119
Even today,
we've only mapped 15% of the
ocean.

246
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:47,000
The purpose of the exploration,
it's to acquire a better
knowledge,

247
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:51,400
understanding how it works,
how species interact,

248
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,759
discovering new species.

249
00:22:56,759 --> 00:23:01,759
Exploring the unknown is now
more important than ever.

250
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,599
We cannot protect what we don't
know.

251
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:21,839
Marine Biologist Dr VreniHäussermann has dedicated her life

252
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,240
to exploring one of the lastwildernesses on earth.

253
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:28,880
CHILEAN FJORD REGION, PATAGONIA

254
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,920
We were the first to look at
everything,
trying to understand

255
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,680
what species are living there
and how they live together.

256
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:48,880
In these remote fjords in
Patagonia,

257
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,039
she's been tackling
one of the biggest challenges of
all -

258
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:57,000
the threat to Earth's
biodiversity.

259
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,480
Diving down there in the
darkness

260
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:16,079
the first couple of metres,
generally,
it's really green and dark.

261
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,559
And then,
you suddenly get into a clearer
area.

262
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,519
There are many secrets
hidden down there.

263
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:37,640
It's our responsibility
to explore what's down in the
ocean

264
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,839
and to show people what we find.

265
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:46,680
Using new robotic technology,

266
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:48,759
they've gone further and deeper.

267
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:58,559
Finding previously unknownspecies that have lived here for
millennia.

268
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,519
When we saw the corals for the
first time,

269
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:06,240
it was like
“What is that that looks like a
coral?

270
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:08,720
Why would a coral be in the cold
water?”

271
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:14,720
We don't find them in any otherplaces in the whole of Patagonia,

272
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,960
so it's really interesting,
it's a very special area.

273
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,960
Bright lights
make everything look just snowy.

274
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,640
So, it was really exciting
because nobody had known they
were there.

275
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:34,519
For a biologist to discover this
is the dream of your life.

276
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,880
Vreni's discoveries astonished
the world.

277
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,119
It led to the first
comprehensive field guide,

278
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,920
featuring over 500 fjord
species.

279
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:58,279
Vreni had uncovered a hiddenworld no-one knew existed.

280
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,119
This took 10 years of work

281
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,599
and brought together people
from 25 countries

282
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,559
and they all helped to describe
the species from Chilean
Patagonia,

283
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,559
which was a really big effort

284
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,759
because there was very little
in literature about these
species.

285
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,799
But as Vreni has continued
exploring,

286
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,079
she's also witnessed
a frightening transformation.

287
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:29,720
When I first arrived
in the fjord here in 2003,

288
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:32,480
there were only three small
salmon farms.

289
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,839
Within about 10 years,
they were popping up everywhere.

290
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:45,359
Pollution from salmon farms
and the impact of climate change

291
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,240
are having disastrousconsequences on this delicately balanced
ecosystem.

292
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,319
The changes were really serious.

293
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,759
We started being really worried
about the future of the fjord.

294
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,480
In recent years there have been
mass die offs everywhere,

295
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:12,119
including fish, jellyfish,
starfish, and even whales.

296
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,960
We saw a big coral mortality.

297
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,559
99% of the corals died off

298
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,839
and they haven't
recovered since then.

299
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,920
What is happening in Patagonia
is taking place everywhere.

300
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:42,079
Globally a species is lost
approximately every ten minutes.

301
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,400
This loss of biodiversity
matters to us all.

302
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:55,160
It's like a ball of threads,
where all the species are
connected.

303
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,000
If we start losing species
because they are going extinct,

304
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:01,799
we're kind of cutting the
threads

305
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,200
and that makes
the whole ball unstable.

306
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:08,799
The whole ecosystem
can break down

307
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,759
and we have really
no control over what happens.

308
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:20,160
Vreni's discoveries haverevealed the true value of life in the
fjords.

309
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,799
Helping her prove
to the Chilean government

310
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,559
how vital it is
to protect what's left.

311
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,720
The danger really here
is that we are losing species

312
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:35,880
that we don't even know yet.

313
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:41,839
We have to start
really understanding the
ecosystems

314
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:46,759
and trying to describe thediversity so that we can start to protect
it.

315
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:49,759
Because the diversity is asimportant as the climate for the planet.

316
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,559
There's no planet B,

317
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,799
no other planet
where there's so much life.

318
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,240
And if we destroy this planet,

319
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:03,920
we don't have more chances,

320
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,119
we need to do something now.

321
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,759
I've spent most of my lifeexploring the deepest parts of the ocean.

322
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,079
I've helped design and build
innovative technology

323
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:35,119
to go deeper and stay longer
under the sea.

324
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:42,680
Here we are,

325
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:45,359
more than a thousand feet down -

326
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,359
it's 304.2 metres down

327
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,960
and it's dark, it's wonderfully
dark.

328
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,920
The ocean below 100 metres or
so,

329
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,160
makes up 90% of all space
occupied by life on earth.

330
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:11,039
And yet most of it
is yet to be seen or explored.

331
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:16,079
To understand and care for theocean we must go deeper.

332
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,880
And also build new technology

333
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,680
enabling us to stay underwater
for longer.

334
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,279
Like space, this environment
is not made for men.

335
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,599
It's a world full of mystery.

336
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:50,319
Time underwater is a unique
gift.

337
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,680
Offering scientists an
opportunity

338
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:56,279
to monitor and protect
our rapidly vanishing world.

339
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:08,759
There was a dream,
to create a new scientific
observatory.

340
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:15,680
To have a better understanding
of the rules that drive the
ocean.

341
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:30,480
Explorer Ghislain Bardout

342
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:33,920
is leading a four-year
scientific expedition around the
world.

343
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,200
Using creative technology tomonitor the negative consequences

344
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:42,759
of climate change on marine
life.

345
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
We decided to sell our house.

346
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,440
We sold everything we had.

347
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:52,960
But we did it, we took the risk.

348
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:56,799
We just sailed from south to
north,

349
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,680
we did hundreds
and hundreds of dives.

350
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,480
Along their 50,000 mile journey,

351
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:10,640
they have dived
under the Arctic ice caps.

352
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,640
And collaborated
with over 40 international
scientists.

353
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,759
Their latest expedition
has brought them

354
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:27,319
to the remote waters
of the South Pacific.

355
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:36,440
Since a kid I have been inspired
by pioneers like Sylvia Earle

356
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:39,000
and their work
with underwater habitats.

357
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,720
Ghislain and his team
have designed a capsule

358
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,920
that allows them to no longer
count dives in hours, but days.

359
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,240
We had the idea to create
a new scientific observatory

360
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:00,680
adapted to our time.

361
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:21,240
The capsule's design
leaves no footprint on the ocean
floor,

362
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:24,119
so it can be placed
anywhere in the world.

363
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,640
No noise, no pollution.

364
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,720
With this approach,

365
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:37,559
you can get a betterunderstanding of the ocean,

366
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,039
of what's happening down there.

367
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,200
Staying underwater
for days at a time

368
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:59,160
has enabled the team
to monitor previously hidden
changes.

369
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,880
We could see the life of thereef which is like a town.

370
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,639
You can follow a fish

371
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,119
from where he wakes up
in the morning,

372
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,880
how they move away

373
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,119
and they disappear
for a few minutes or hours

374
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,519
and then they come back.

375
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,679
The chance to live underwater,
literally.

376
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,000
To spend day and night living
underwater with the fish,

377
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,480
it's not a common experience,
it's not an easy one also,

378
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:53,920
but it's incredibly rare and
rich.

379
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:02,119
These long-term observations
are already providing vital data

380
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:05,239
for a dozen
international research
institutions.

381
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,079
Ghislain hopes the capsule will
be used
throughout the world

382
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:16,440
to continue to monitor
the impact of climate change.

383
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,079
With the capsule programme
it's only the beginning.

384
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,840
I do believe that our
imagination

385
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,000
has to be continuouslyassociated with technologies

386
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,360
and that way,
we can create new tools

387
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,440
to have a modern understanding
of the ocean

388
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:47,679
and to preserve
not only the ocean but us.

389
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,239
To save the ocean,
we must keep exploring.

390
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:05,960
But for change to be permanent

391
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:08,760
we must pass our knowledge
on to this generation -

392
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,039
and the next.

393
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:13,480
We need to start with the
children

394
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:15,480
and hand on the knowledge

395
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:18,360
and all the children
need to be aware of the
situation

396
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,800
and the risk for their future,

397
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,519
so that they can help
to make the necessary changes.

398
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,119
I think it's important
that the new generation learn

399
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:32,159
from what's being done

400
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:35,079
and what needs
to be improved upon

401
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:39,480
and getting kids involved
in science and ocean protection.

402
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:45,039
Our future depends on ourability to capture hearts and minds.

403
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,440
Do you have a question
for Shannon the Shark,

404
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:50,239
or the amazing Dr Sylvia Earle?

405
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:56,559
What sort of animals have youseen underwater while diving?

406
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:58,239
Good question.

407
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,440
Well, I have seen sperm whales
come back to the surface

408
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:05,800
after they've been
thousands of feet down

409
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:10,039
and they still have
squid tentacles, like spaghetti.

410
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:20,039
If every one of us learns
to love and care for the sea,

411
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:22,679
we can win the battle
to save the ocean.

412
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,280
In Peru this ability
to ignite passion for the sea

413
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:35,039
is helping save
one of their most threatened
species.

414
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,039
I remember I was out in the
water,

415
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,400
just looking out in the blue.

416
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,719
And then all of a sudden,
one of the fishermen spots it.

417
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:23,360
Giant manta rays
for me are magical.

418
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,079
They are so powerful,
but they are so gentle.

419
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:29,960
They're just majestic.

420
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:39,320
Marine biologist KerstinForsberg has been studying these gentle
giants.

421
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:47,679
Reaching over 7 metres in
length,

422
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,360
they can tell us about
the health of the ocean as a
whole.

423
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:54,360
If you see a giant manta ray,

424
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,039
you know that it's coming there

425
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:57,960
because it's a healthy ecosystem
that it's feeding on.

426
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:13,639
But fishing and hunting
have put them at risk.

427
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:24,920
Giant mantas are a vulnerablespecies that's threatened worldwide

428
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,920
that has a population
that's decreasing up to 30%
globally

429
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,519
and in some places up to 80%.

430
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:55,960
Kerstin's mission is to find newways of protecting this vulnerable
species

431
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,000
by involving every member
of her local community.

432
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:07,119
It is about connecting people
to the species,

433
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:08,639
and connecting people to the
ocean.

434
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:13,320
Kerstin and her team work
with local fishermen

435
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,920
to find alternative income
through ecotourism.

436
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:18,559
And to value them
as living treasures.

437
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:25,039
They're worth far more
in the ocean alive

438
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,960
because people will come
and they will see them

439
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:29,400
and they will want more people,
more tourists to come in

440
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,159
and it will build
the whole ecotourism industry.

441
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:39,599
But, to make sure
changes are sustainable,

442
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:41,480
Kerstin is doing even more.

443
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:45,639
Raising awareness
with the next generation.

444
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,119
Everybody can make a difference.

445
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:52,480
Everybody,
starting from a two-year-old
kid.

446
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,880
Working with over 50 local
schools

447
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,360
and engaging with hundreds
of thousands of people
throughout Peru

448
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,920
Kerstin has empowered the nextgeneration to lead their own campaigns.

449
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:13,760
Her success has since inspired
other youth movements around the
world.

450
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,079
I tell all the kids that we work
with,

451
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:34,239
you don't have to be a biologist
or a conservationist to change
the world,

452
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,039
you can change the world

453
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:40,280
from whatever career or path
that you decide to take in life.

454
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:50,119
In a place where mantas wereonce hunted to near extinction,

455
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:53,239
Kerstin's showing
how real change can happen.

456
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:05,039
Today, it is now illegal to
capture,
sell or eat mantas in Peru.

457
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,800
Protect me!

458
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,079
Care for me!

459
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:17,920
For me, sharing knowledge
and working together is key.

460
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,159
We need to be all together.

461
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:24,639
Everybody wants to live
in a healthy planet.

462
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,039
Everybody can make a difference.

463
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,039
When I was a child,

464
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:42,880
most people thought the ocean
was too big to fail.

465
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:48,360
Now we know it is in trouble
and therefore, so are we.

466
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:54,400
Currently less than 10% is
protected.

467
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:59,119
But to stand a chance of saving
the blue heart of the planet -

468
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:01,199
we must protect at least 30%.

469
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,599
And there is a place in the
Indian Ocean
that is cause for hope.

470
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:28,000
The Seychelles is part
of a global network of ‘Hope
Spots'.

471
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:34,280
Created by the Non-ProfitOrganisation Mission Blue,

472
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,760
these are places critical
to the health of the ocean

473
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:39,559
that need protection and care.

474
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,880
- Angelique.
- Hi, Sylvia.

475
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,480
- How are you?
- I'm very well thank you.

476
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:46,239
- How are you?
- Good to see you.

477
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:50,239
I'm so glad you're here,
you're all champions.

478
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,599
Each 'Hope Spot' starts
with a champion, like Angelique

479
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:01,199
who has empowered everyone
from the grass roots up to take
action.

480
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,000
The Seychelles often sees itself
as a laboratory.

481
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,320
You can test whether
something would work,

482
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,320
and from there we can inspireothers to say it does work,

483
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,800
it's your turn to take action.

484
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:19,639
There are
some impressive projects here.

485
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:24,880
Today, a youth-led beach
clean-up
is collecting tonnes of trah

486
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,239
washed up
from all over the world.

487
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:32,840
Elsewhere fishermen
remove rubbish from the reefs.

488
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:41,440
Others have voluntarily
stopped fishing for 6 months.

489
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:47,079
Fishers who typically would havebeen taking out of the ocean,

490
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:52,119
they want to pilot for the very
first time
a temporary fish closure

491
00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:55,760
and in fact will collect data
about the impact of a closure

492
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,880
to be able to inform policy.

493
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:05,719
And, particularly exciting for
me,

494
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,159
scientists are surveying
seagrass meadows

495
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:12,960
to calculate their role incapturing and storing carbon from the
atmosphere.

496
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,480
What's incredible is how
the whole country has taken
action -

497
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,400
including the president himself.

498
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,800
And it just shows you the amount
of areas that we have protected.

499
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,239
It's paradise.

500
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:41,639
You know, when I first came
here,
you were two years old.

501
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:43,280
Wow, wow.

502
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:46,400
It was 1964.

503
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,320
There was no protection
for the ocean, zero.

504
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,880
Zero protection.

505
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,199
But people thought
we didn't need protection.

506
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:03,239
Today 30% of the waterssurrounding the Seychelles are protected by
law -

507
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:06,559
ten years ahead of global
targets.

508
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,320
Time has come for us to act.

509
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,320
And you have been there,

510
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,280
we need to listen to you

511
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:24,760
and continue to listen
to the scientists around the
world.

512
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:50,360
The people of this small nation
are showing the world

513
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,519
how one action times ten,

514
00:46:52,599 --> 00:46:55,280
times a thousand, times a
million,
makes change.

515
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:05,280
It's great to see that there are
still fish in large numbers
here.

516
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:14,119
And not just one species,
but at least a dozen in this one
area.

517
00:47:21,719 --> 00:47:23,079
It's so beautiful.

518
00:47:23,159 --> 00:47:25,519
It was nice weather.

519
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:28,320
I think I want to be
one of them.

520
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,280
Plenty of reason for hope.

521
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,400
We're diving in a 'Hope Spot'
after all.

522
00:47:42,679 --> 00:47:46,559
The Seychelles is just one
of a growing number of 'Hope
Spots' -

523
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:48,599
130 so far.

524
00:47:48,679 --> 00:47:52,159
Inspiring people around theplanet to use their power

525
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:55,679
to restore and protect
the blue heart of the planet.

526
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,280
One of the latest
is where I lived as a child

527
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,679
in Dunedin, Florida.

528
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,719
Thank you, thank you all of you.

529
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:20,320
You all have a key role
using your super powers

530
00:48:21,159 --> 00:48:23,920
to see the recovery
and celebrate it.

531
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,480
We have to cut the ribbon,
right?

532
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:29,519
3,2,1.

533
00:48:46,519 --> 00:48:49,960
Declaring this
as Florida Gulf coast 'Hope
Spot'

534
00:48:50,039 --> 00:48:53,159
gives me special satisfaction

535
00:48:53,239 --> 00:48:55,280
because this is
where for me it started.

536
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:59,079
There are 130 'Hope Spots'
now around the world

537
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,920
and all of them really matter.

538
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:14,519
Our fate and the oceans are one.

539
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,840
With every drop of water you
drink,
every breath you take

540
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,679
you are connected to the sea.

541
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:32,239
It's what makes
all life on earth possible.

542
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:41,960
Thanks to a global network ofscientists - innovating, educating and
exploring -

543
00:49:42,639 --> 00:49:43,800
we know what we need to do.

544
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,280
Trying to actually
communicate the science

545
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,639
so that people understand
the value of these ecosystems

546
00:49:51,719 --> 00:49:53,960
and what it means if we lose
them,
is so important.

547
00:49:59,639 --> 00:50:02,159
Each and every one of us
can make a difference.

548
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,000
I call upon all of you to do
your part.

549
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:13,360
You could be an explorer -

550
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,679
discovering hidden worlds
before they are lost.

551
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:21,639
This capacity to listen to sound
and to explore the environment

552
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:25,960
is allowing us to get a little
bit closer
to understanding how it works

553
00:50:26,039 --> 00:50:27,320
and how we can save it.

554
00:50:32,119 --> 00:50:33,639
Or you can be an inventor -

555
00:50:33,719 --> 00:50:37,000
building new technology
to explore the ocean.

556
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:40,360
It's going to take
innovative technology

557
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,880
and the biggest and bestscientists from around the world

558
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,159
to protect and save our oceans.

559
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:50,480
Or you can be the teacher

560
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:53,320
inspiring others
to make a difference.

561
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:57,679
For me it's not
just about exchanging knowledge

562
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,199
from peer to peer,

563
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,800
but it's really
about exchanging knowledge

564
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,320
from one generation
to the other.

565
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:10,440
Or you can be the one with hope
-

566
00:51:10,519 --> 00:51:14,320
showing that anyone
can change everything.

567
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:18,000
Now, there's a chance -

568
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:21,400
and that's what I'm working flatout to achieve -

569
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,679
that in the future
they'll look back and say

570
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:29,159
thank you 21st century humans,
you did get it.

571
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,000
Together we can create
a perpetual planet.
