3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,920
In 1960, Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho
changed the face of horror.

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,360
But the most terrifying part?

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,040
It was based on true events.

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,560
There really was a Norman Bates.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,400
His name?

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,040
Ed Gein.

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,760
The Plainfield Butcher.

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,520
The Body Snatcher.

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,520
The ghoul who transformed
the corpses of his victims

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,720
into a skinsuit
to remind him of his dead mother.

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,800
Gein not only inspired Norman,
but also an entire culture

14
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,240
of cinematic psychos
that haunt our dreams.

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,000
Now, 63 years later,
on the anniversary of Ed's arrest,

16
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,200
and for the very first time,
we seek proof and answers.

17
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,400
Does Ed Gein still torment
Plainfield, Wisconsin today?

18
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,880
Mary?
Will the evil spirit of Ed Gein

19
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,280
and the atrocities committed here...

20
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,600
I don't even want to see this.
Oh, God!

21
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,280
...forever haunt
this small Midwestern town?

22
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,600
First day of investigation.

23
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,920
It is November 12th, 2020.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,040
And I'm in Plainfield, Wisconsin.

25
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,760
Population just barely over 900.

26
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,520
I'm here to investigate claims of
the paranormal by local residents

27
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,960
who believe the spirit of Ed Gein,

28
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,040
one of the most monstrous killers in
American history,

29
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,240
is haunting this community.

30
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,760
On the night of November 16th, 1957,

31
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,280
a missing persons investigation
was underway in Plainfield.

32
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,800
Bernice Worden, owner of the local
hardware store,

33
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,600
had vanished that morning
after a visit

34
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,040
from the town's reclusive handyman,
51-year old Ed Gein.

35
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,800
With the suspect
already taken into custody,

36
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,600
investigators executed
a search warrant on his home.

37
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,040
Check upstairs.

38
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:29,040
By morning, the depth of Gein's
depravity had been fully revealed.

39
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,160
Not only did police find Bernice
Worden's decapitated body

40
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,320
hanging from the rafters,
they also uncovered a chair

41
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,040
upholstered with human skin,
skulls turned into bowls,

42
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,640
silverware made from bones,

43
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,720
a belt made from nipples,

44
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,840
and, finally, Gein's masterpiece,

45
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:56,240
a suit sewn together
from the skins of multiple women.

46
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,760
Amongst the grisly collection,

47
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,960
police also found the face
of Mary Hogan,

48
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,920
a Plainfield tavern owner
who'd mysteriously disappeared

49
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,160
in the middle of a shift
three years earlier.

50
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,840
Bernice and Mary were the only women
Gein admitted to killing.

51
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,880
The other ten, he had dug up
from the local cemetery

52
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,200
to use in his creations.

53
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,560
Is it any wonder
that many Plainfield residents

54
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:33,800
believe the spirit of Ed Gein
still terrorises this area?

55
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,880
That's why I'm here.

56
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,960
Ever since Ed Gein's
house of horrors was discovered,

57
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,360
Plainfield, Wisconsin, has been
a hotbed of paranormal activity.

58
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,120
The activity runs the gamut
of everything from personal attack,

59
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,600
people being scratched, shadowy
figures, disembodied voices,

60
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,400
and some of the residents actually
believe the spirit of Ed Gein

61
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,600
is making them physically ill.

62
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,840
Here, I have several sites of
interest where the inhabitants

63
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,560
and the owners claim to have extreme
paranormal activity.

64
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,960
My goal is to investigate and
interview everybody we possibly can.

65
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,680
And right now, we need to head to
our first location,

66
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,840
which is the original home
of Ed Gein, the Ed Gein Farm.

67
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,960
So, right now,
we're going through the heart

68
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,280
of small town, downtown, Plainfield.

69
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,320
It's so small, it's so remote

70
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,000
that you can imagine how close-knit
it must be.

71
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,920
And when you drive through here,
you can just only imagine

72
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,320
how much the Ed Gein murders
affected this community.

73
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,120
It must of have just sent shock
waves right through the whole town.

74
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,520
Cindy Kaza
is a renowned psychic medium

75
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,440
who can communicate
with the spirit world.

76
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,080
I've asked her to meet me
at Ed Gein's property

77
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,560
and have only told her the basic
details of the case.

78
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,760
As we approach the Gein farm,
I'm definitely getting excited,

79
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,800
got a nervous energy about me,

80
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,360
I just wanna get out there,
see what I can see,

81
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,440
feel what we can feel.

82
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,120
Yeah, that's it.
That's Ed Gein's farm.

83
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Right there's the gate.

84
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,120
It's kind of an ominous feeling
just being here in this spot.

85
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,840
This will be the first time
in history

86
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,080
anyone has been allowed
back on the property to investigate,

87
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,200
just five days before
the anniversary of his arrest.

88
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,200
In the months after the murder,
the Gein farm

89
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,040
became a ghoulish attraction visited
by locals and tourists alike,

90
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,320
eager for a glimpse
of real-life horror.

91
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,840
But that all came to an abrupt end
in March of 1958.

92
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,240
The farm where Ed Gein lived

93
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,000
and where much of the grizzly
evidence has been found,

94
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,000
has been levelled.
It burned down one night.

95
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,480
All these years later,
trees and brush have overgrown

96
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,720
most of the farm site. But Cindy
should still be able to sense

97
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,360
if the ghost of Ed Gein
still lurks nearby.

98
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,600
I want to see if Cindy can sense
where the house was

99
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,720
and tap into the paranormal energy
on the land.

100
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,920
Cindy. Steve, good to see you.
Good to see you, too.

101
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,520
How's it going? Good. Thanks so much
for coming out. Absolutely.

102
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,600
So, we're about to walk into
a lot of energy that I worry

103
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,680
could affect us mentally and
emotionally, so just be on guard.

104
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,760
OK.
Yeah. Absolutely.

105
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,840
I couldn't agree more.
Yeah.

106
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,920
Yeah. There's gotta be
something really significant

107
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,280
about this area right here.

108
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,080
It's like, I keep feeling there,
but then they're like, "No, go back,

109
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,160
stand right here, stand right here.

110
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,080
This is where you need to be."

111
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,000
So, I need to trust it. So, it
should be right...

112
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,400
..right there.

113
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,960
You're spot on. This is exactly
where the Ed Gein farm house was.

114
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,120
It's super intense here.

115
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,400
So every... Everything has energy
attached to it.

116
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,520
So what I want to do
is touch the ground

117
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,760
and see what feelings or images come
to me when I do that.

118
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,800
Oh, wow! That's not good.

119
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,520
I-I-I just keep seeing blood.

120
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,800
I keep seeing throats being slit
and blood pouring out of the neck.

121
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,880
Is there a hill?

122
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,800
Or is there, like, a...

123
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,760
any part of this land
that has a little bit of a hill,

124
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,200
or a mound or something?

125
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,200
I think there's a bit of a slope
like that about 20 yards this way.

126
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,240
A mound. The hill...
I keep...

127
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,960
I keep seeing it, but I keep feeling
there are bodies buried there.

128
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,800
There's bodies buried there.
There's more...

129
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,840
There's more death on this property
that happened.

130
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,880
And... And there are pieces...

131
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,120
of remains spread out on this land.

132
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,200
OK. Um...

133
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,440
In my mind,
I see this flash of a woman.

134
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,800
And this woman, she's wearing
like a nightgown,

135
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,920
like a sleeping outfit.
She is standing right there.

136
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,240
I can see her, she's following us.

137
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,520
I see her. Like she is... It's kinda
like she's stalking us, Steve.

138
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,320
She's very, very aware
that we're here.

139
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,880
And she's not happy about it.
I can sense her.

140
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,600
I sense her.
I honestly feel like it's mother.

141
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,280
I feel like she's here, honestly.
I feel like she's here.

142
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,320
And she's also protective of her
family's reputation.

143
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,400
She doesn't like it.

144
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,760
I believe that Cindy is picking up
on the spirit of Augusta Gein,

145
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,520
Ed Gein's mother.

146
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,240
We've only been on the farm here for
a few minutes

147
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,280
and she's already tapping into
Augusta's energy.

148
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,880
Mom, Mother,
is calling me a little witch.

149
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,960
She's...she's calling me a witch.

150
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,760
I feel her spirit still.

151
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,480
Her spirit still walks around here

152
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,680
and she is really pissed off that
I'm here,

153
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,880
because I'm doing the devil's work,
in her mind.

154
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,680
I sense her.

155
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,200
I honestly feel like it's Mother.

156
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,400
I feel like she's here. Honestly,
I feel like she's here.

157
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,280
And she's also protective of her
family's reputation.

158
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,040
So anytime we start to dig up dirt,
she's not gonna like it.

159
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,640
So the more that we uncover...
She doesn't like it.

160
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,000
She was an extremely
dominating force. Yeah.

161
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,840
From Ed's psych evaluation,

162
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,200
it's clear Augusta shaped her son
into the madman he'd become.

163
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,600
With Ed's father
consumed by alcoholism,

164
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,760
it was Augusta who ran the household
with an iron fist.

165
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,640
A domineering religious zealot

166
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,920
who taught her sons
that women were evil.

167
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,120
After his father died of heart
failure in 1940,

168
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,000
and his older brother Henry
was killed

169
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,040
in a suspicious fire
on the farm in 1944,

170
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,240
it was just Augusta and Ed
living together.

171
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,320
Townsfolk thought Ed was a little
weird and kind of effeminate,

172
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,640
peculiar for never starting a family
of his own.

173
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,720
No one really knew the half of it.

174
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,480
For this small Wisconsin community
of under 700 persons,

175
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,240
they remember the shock and the fear
that suddenly gripped them

176
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,320
when the grizzly tale of Ed Gein
became public.

177
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,600
Well, I've known him
ever since he was a little boy.

178
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,680
And he seems to be a little odd.

179
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,760
Odd? Odd. I always figured
he was just perfectly harmless.

180
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,640
Augusta died in 1945 when Ed was 39,

181
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,800
and that's when his behaviour
started to change.

182
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,720
Could it be Augusta's
hold on her son was so strong

183
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,440
that she controlled him
from the grave?

184
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:26,160
And I think that's exactly the
energy that Cindy is picking up on.

185
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,840
And it's extremely unpleasant.

186
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:35,120
I feel we're gonna uncover deeper
things...about this property itself.

187
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,040
A night investigation here,
I can only imagine. Yeah.

188
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,680
This entire investigation
of everything, be careful.

189
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,040
We should probably trek out
of here. You ready? Yeah.

190
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,960
We just got done
walking the Gein Farm.

191
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,760
I can tell you the energy here
at the farm is extremely powerful.

192
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,000
I can feel it, Cindy's picking up on
a lot of different things.

193
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,080
I think we're gonna stop now.
We need to head into town,

194
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,680
get our bearings and come back
with more information.

195
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,920
But we are definitely coming back
here for a full-on investigation.

196
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,120
While Cindy regroups before
tonight's investigation,

197
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,320
I'm headed to Worden's hardware
store in downtown Plainfield.

198
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,320
That's where Ed murdered Bernice

199
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,600
before bringing her back to his
house and stringing her up

200
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,680
and gutting her like a deer.

201
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,520
The theory is after Augusta died,

202
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,360
Ed was so devasted he would
do anything to bring her back.

203
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,440
The Worden's hardware store is one
of the most infamous locations

204
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,520
involving the Gein murders.

205
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,960
On November 16th, Ed went there

206
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,840
under the guise
of purchasing antifreeze.

207
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,600
Bring your jug?

208
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,280
But most people believe his
real goal was to kill Bernice,

209
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,360
who reminded him of his dear mother.

210
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,640
'Do it now.

211
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,600
Be careful.'

212
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,280
Some people even claim
that Ed heard Augusta's voice

213
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,960
urging him to do
these terrible things.

214
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,400
Do it, Ed. Do it now!

215
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,320
No!

216
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,360
After Bernice's murder,
fewer and fewer people

217
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,560
wanted to step foot
in the hardware store.

218
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,800
It went out of business
and the building was sold.

219
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,760
It's now a storage facility.

220
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,840
The current owners feel like
they're being watched all the time

221
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,160
and there
are unexplained cold spots.

222
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,760
And one time, a glass flew off
the shelf and broke on its own.

223
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,360
Ed Gein confessed to killing Bernice
Worden inside this building,

224
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,840
but the question remains, why?

225
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,960
The theory is
that he targeted middle-aged women

226
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,640
who resembled his mother
just to use them in his skin suit.

227
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,600
Hey, Cindy.
What's up, Steve?

228
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,480
Here you go.
Thank you.

229
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,560
OK.

230
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,080
Worden's Hardware store.
Right.

231
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,560
We know Ed killed Bernice Worden
right here in this very shop.

232
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,560
And I'm wondering if the
evil from that brutal murder

233
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,960
remains here to this day.
Right.

234
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,520
Is Worden's even haunted?
And if so, by who?

235
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,520
Also, I wanna see if you can
pinpoint and sense

236
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,920
the exact location
where Bernice was murdered.

237
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,520
I've got devices
set up in multiple spots,

238
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,640
I've got infrared light covering us.

239
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,240
I think I want to
just kind of take a second

240
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,120
to feel into...where I'm drawn.

241
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:25,360
I'm here, right. I'm here,
but I'm also...at his house.

242
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,920
I can't separate my visions
from here and his house.

243
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,520
That beeping, where is that
coming from? That's the REM pod.

244
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,680
This device alerts
when a spirit is in close proximity.

245
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,760
Is somebody here with us?

246
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,640
I wanna do some automatic writing in
here,

247
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,400
but, in all honesty,
I'm a little bit afraid

248
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,720
to open myself up to the energy
of this...this case.

249
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,360
So, I'm gonna do it,

250
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,720
because I think it will help us
put some pieces together,

251
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,800
but I'm gonna need you to make sure
to watch my back. OK.

252
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,800
In case things get really weird.

253
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,080
100%.
Yeah.

254
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,240
This is insane, Cindy.
I know.

255
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,600
So you can sit right there and you
can put your lantern on the table

256
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,440
and your tablet.
OK.

257
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,040
Automatic writing is a technique
Cindy uses

258
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,600
to open herself up
to the spirit world.

259
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,480
She's hoping to connect directly
to Bernice.

260
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,400
But the REM pod beeping is nonstop.

261
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,720
Honestly, every time I
try to tap in or I start zoning in,

262
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,160
they go off.
It's like a distraction.

263
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,800
It's almost like...
to stop me from getting answers.

264
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,600
Cindy's only been in Worden's
for a matter of minutes

265
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,960
and already the activity is through
the roof.

266
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,520
And now something is beginning
to target her specifically.

267
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,440
OK, so the woman...who worked here,

268
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,120
the woman who had died,
he...he hit her on the head.

269
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,280
Bernice was actually
shot in the back of the head.

270
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,320
That's what you're picking up on.

271
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,120
That's the hit to the head.
And then it also said

272
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,200
that like he led her
or she led him to get something.

273
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,040
Je must have come into the store
to get something or tricked her.

274
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,640
I feel
that's very much what happened.

275
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,000
It's exactly what happened.
It's what happened.

276
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,400
He came in here to buy antifreeze.
Oh, my God!

277
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:01,160
I honestly don't feel
that her spirit is...is here.

278
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,280
It's not stuck here. I feel like

279
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,520
there's some psychic imprinting
thing that could happen,

280
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,120
or memory
attached to the building... Right.

281
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,440
..but I don't feel like she's...

282
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,520
..stuck here.

283
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,600
If you don't think Bernice is here,

284
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,600
what do you suspect is the activity
that the owners' describe?

285
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,680
The feeling of being watched?

286
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,160
Honestly, the thing with Ed
is that I feel once you start

287
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,040
tapping into his presence
or his energy, it follows you.

288
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,240
It follows you. It can be anywhere.
Once you're on that land,

289
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,240
it's like it gets into you.

290
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,200
Let's go take a look.

291
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,560
A lot of broken glass right here.

292
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,840
It sounded like knocking or tapping.

293
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,240
What was that?
Your camera died?

294
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,480
It's insane, the battery drain
in this building.

295
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,880
Everything's dying.
There was a knocking.

296
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,280
I heard it. I heard it.
If your camera is dead,

297
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,880
go ahead and put it down
and go get the SLS system.

298
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,320
Let's see if we can capture
an anomaly here.

299
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,600
Throughout
the investigation tonight,

300
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,440
we've used a lot of different gear,

301
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,040
but right now,
I'm gonna focus on using an SLS.

302
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,400
Basically, the SLS shoots out
a pattern of infrared lights

303
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,280
and anything that's
three-dimensional, like a person,

304
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,960
will appear on the screen
as an anomaly.

305
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:40,200
Well, whatever and whoever
is in this building...

306
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,840
..likes to mess with people.

307
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,400
My ear just started ringing.

308
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,080
It's weird.

309
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,080
His spirit is definitely here.

310
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,520
His energy
is definitely in this building.

311
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,160
Mm-hm.

312
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,120
It's right next to you, Cindy.
I mean, right next to you.

313
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,120
I feel something coming close.

314
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,160
Oh, God!
Are you OK?

315
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,960
Yeah. No, I just had an image
of my ear being chewed off,

316
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,640
like bitten off.

317
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,400
There's something building,
it's coming right behind me.

318
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,320
I feel it in my chest.

319
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,720
Something with my ear
being sliced off.

320
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,840
If this is you, Ed, are you
threatened by Cindy's presence?

321
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,520
Her ability to call these things out
as she sees them?

322
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,280
And now it's gone.
Hm.

323
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,960
I feel like he's not gone, though.

324
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,680
I'm trying to feel where...

325
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,160
..where the trail...
where the body would've been.

326
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,240
Where did this happen?

327
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,880
It's almost like
I wanna be right in here.

328
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,160
I do have something here
that may be able to help us.

329
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:18,120
Ed Gein used the excuse to come here
to Worden's hardware store

330
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,400
because he needed antifreeze.

331
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,840
This could be
a perfect trigger object.

332
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,240
Using a trigger item
helps to remind the spirit

333
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,360
of something
that's important to them,

334
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,480
to entice the spirit to communicate.

335
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,760
Was this the spot, Ed?

336
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,080
Is this where it happened?
Can you set the record straight?

337
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,920
Ed, is there more bodies
on the farm?

338
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,160
Yeah.

339
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,280
Sounds like Ed has more to tell us.

340
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,640
I definitely think there's a lot
more to the story.

341
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:14,120
There's no question in my mind, we
contacted Ed Gein tonight. I agree.

342
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,640
This is a really dangerous space
to be walking in.

343
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,240
So, that investigation
was extremely intense.

344
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,200
I had no idea we were gonna capture
that much activity,

345
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,880
or that Cindy was gonna tap into
Gein's energy,

346
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,960
basically right off the bat.

347
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,560
He can interact with us, he's aware
of our presence,

348
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,040
and he is trying
to communicate with us.

349
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,760
We are definitely dealing with
an intelligent being,

350
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,840
it's an intelligent haunting.

351
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:45,320
The old Worden's hardware store
in Plainfield Wisconsin,

352
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,400
definitely haunted.

353
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,400
During
the investigation at Worden's,

354
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,280
I truly believe that the spirit of
Gein was trying to attach

355
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,160
or attack or harm Cindy,
because she's a woman.

356
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,720
All of Gein's victims were female.

357
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,480
And I believe
he was trying to get to her.

358
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,560
Tonight was our first night on the
Gein investigation

359
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,200
and...man, it was intense.

360
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,240
As a woman on this case,

361
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:27,280
I feel like I'm a target.
I feel like Gein wants to harm me.

362
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,080
I feel like
I'm a walking trigger object.

363
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,400
And being that this is only day one,

364
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,640
I really have no idea what we're
in for,

365
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,720
but I know that I really need
to keep my guard up.

366
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,920
Now that we know that Worden's
is haunted,

367
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,080
I'm curious if other locations
around town are haunted as well.

368
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,920
Many of the locals claim
that the old Waushara County Jail

369
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,880
is actually haunted.
That's the jail where Ed Gein

370
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,840
was held and questioned
by police for three days.

371
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,400
Bernice was murdered
inside her hardware store

372
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,960
on the morning of November 16th.

373
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:04,200
Less than 24 hours later,

374
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:09,040
police found her decapitated body
hanging from Gein's ceiling,

375
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,640
gutted liken an animal.

376
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,720
Inside a nearby burlap sack,

377
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,920
they discovered her head.

378
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,360
Police quickly found Ed having
dinner at a neighbour's house.

379
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,480
They arrested him and brought him
down to the station.

380
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,920
For the first 30 hours
of his arrest,

381
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,440
Gein refused to talk to the police.

382
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,120
He initially denies everything.

383
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,120
How long? Huh?

384
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,680
How long has this been going on?

385
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,880
I got a tip today that a local
paranormal investigator

386
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,520
named Michelle actually visited
the old Waushara County Jail,

387
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,120
which is now a museum.

388
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,040
She claims she was physically
attacked by Gein himself.

389
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,160
So, tomorrow I wanna meet with her

390
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,200
and learn everything I can about
her experience at the old jail.

391
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,040
But I wanna do it by myself
without Cindy.

392
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,240
I don't want Cindy to have any
information about the case

393
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,520
or how or why the old jail
could be haunted.

394
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,440
Hi. Thanks so much
for meeting me out here.

395
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,720
Nice to meet you.
You too.

396
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,760
You've got some evidence
for me to check out? I do.

397
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,760
We were investigating the jail
at Waushara County

398
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:49,760
on some EVP and you could hear him
say "Ed" and then "Edward".

399
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,040
Felt a sensation
on the back of my neck,

400
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,040
and all of a sudden
there was a burning sensation

401
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,760
from the right to the left,

402
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,600
and it felt like
I was being scratched.

403
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,400
Since then, I actually feel that...

404
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,040
he still is somehow attached to me.

405
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,760
So...

406
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,040
You seem pretty shook up right now
just even talking about it.

407
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,520
Yeah, it...it bothers me, actually.

408
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,360
I really appreciate you doing this.

409
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,240
I know it probably feels like
opening up wounds again. Yeah.

410
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,840
But we're just really trying

411
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:28,520
to get to the bottom of what's
happening here in Plainfield. Yeah.

412
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,680
Let me play the video recording you
and your group captured at the jail.

413
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,760
Edward.
That's incredible.

414
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,320
What's your name?

415
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,600
And this is the cell that he was in
for four days.

416
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,040
You can start seeing
my body language.

417
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,520
Like, that's when I started feeling
something in the back of my neck.

418
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,600
"Eat them."

419
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,120
"Eat them."
That's exactly what it says.

420
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,040
He's there, he hasn't left.

421
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,960
From right... From right there.

422
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,800
Right there. Yeah, you can see it.
Right there. Yeah.

423
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:50,360
Once again, it's interesting.
There's some guys in your team

424
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,760
and it didn't go after them. No.
But it went after the female,

425
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,320
which is true to Ed Gein's nature.
Correct.

426
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,160
It's one thing for people to say,

427
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,680
"we believe the spirit of Ed Gein
still haunts our community,"

428
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,280
but you were personally marked.
Mm-hm.

429
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,760
Well, being marked is scary,

430
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:10,360
because you don't know what's next,
what's gonna happen next.

431
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,440
That's a little frustrating for me,

432
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,760
cos I don't know what his
intentions are.

433
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,920
He is a very strong...presence,

434
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,880
and I think that controls a lot
that goes on in this area.

435
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,000
What Michelle experienced
is truly incredible.

436
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,800
And what's really amazing to me

437
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,280
is she still feels targeted by Gein
even after her encounter.

438
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,040
Now it's time
for Cindy to visit the museum

439
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,480
and see if she can connect to
the old jail that once stood here

440
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,240
and its most notorious prisoner.

441
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,640
All right, Cindy, I'm gonna give you
one of these. Great. Thank you.

442
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,520
It's like I want to come right here.

443
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:30,000
I'm really confused, cos I feel here
and then... I don't...

444
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,800
Was there ever another one?

445
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,680
Another cell that used to be here
but isn't here any more?

446
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,800
Something like that, yes.
That's why I feel so confused,

447
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,240
cos it's like I feel like it used to
be here, but it's not here.

448
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,320
Like, there's something missing.

449
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,320
Um...

450
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,920
OK.

451
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,800
There's something about this door.

452
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,120
This door feels really important.

453
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,040
It feels...

454
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,640
I feel like this door is right,
other things have been moved.

455
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,760
Something's been moved and changed,
but this is right.

456
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:14,720
What's shocking to me, Cindy,
is you were drawn to this room.

457
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,880
This was Ed Gein's cell.

458
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,520
And the reason this differs from the
smaller more traditional cells,

459
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,520
is they knew they were gonna be

460
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,200
coming in here
questioning him a lot,

461
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,000
trying to get confessions

462
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,440
and possibly to keep him away from
the other inmates,

463
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,320
because I'm sure they wanted to do
him harm.

464
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:42,520
The thing that I feel is, is I keep
hearing...I keep hearing him say,

465
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,520
"I think Mother would be proud."
But...

466
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,680
"Mother would be proud
of the work I did."

467
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,520
Like he really felt
he was making his mother proud

468
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,640
by killing these women.

469
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,200
Could it be possible that Ed

470
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,000
was being influenced or controlled
by his mother from the grave?

471
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:09,280
He's very manipulative though,
the way that he treats people.

472
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:13,480
He's so manipulative.
The lies, there's so many lies.

473
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,680
So many lies.

474
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,000
So you think he was being pretty
deceitful with his confessions,

475
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,880
not telling everything
or misleading the facts? Absolutely.

476
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,520
My head is getting tingly.
That's really weird.

477
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,720
Let me turn on my Mel Meter.
If Ed's currently here with us,

478
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,360
perhaps we'll see spikes in EMF and
fluctuation in temperature.

479
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,440
Who's with us?

480
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,280
That sounded like a response.
Yeah.

481
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,720
Did you say Ed?

482
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,760
This is crazy.
Yeah.

483
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,600
I mean, this is crazy.
Yeah.

484
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,040
Ed, are you with us?

485
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,080
Interference.

486
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,880
As soon as I turned on my devices,

487
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,440
everything went completely haywire.

488
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,560
The K2, the Mel Meter.

489
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,200
The spirit of Ed Gein
is absolutely here

490
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,600
and the old Waushara County Jail
is definitely haunted.

491
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,480
Huge hits...repeatedly.

492
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,920
This is crazy.
Yeah. I mean, this is crazy.

493
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,640
Yeah.

494
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,600
It was like all chaos at once.
Mm-hm.

495
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:58,280
Well, I think we got an answer.

496
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,360
Yeah, immediate answer.

497
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,160
I gotta be honest, I don't...

498
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,960
I'm not often afraid

499
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,680
and I don't wanna go so far
as saying that I'm afraid.

500
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,600
I... We have to be really careful.

501
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,400
We have to be really careful.

502
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,280
Yeah. And the crew, everyone.
Everybody. Everybody.

503
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:29,000
Everybody has to be
really, really careful,

504
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,800
cos we're about to kick the
hornet's nest.

505
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,560
Investigating the jail tonight
was...crazy.

506
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,280
I mean, I definitely believe

507
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,040
there is something going on
with Ed and his mom.

508
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:53,360
And I really believe that he thought
that if he did all of these things,

509
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,560
that his mom would be proud of him.

510
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:59,440
And that's exactly why he was
doing all of these things.

511
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,520
What an incredible day.
We definitely made contact

512
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,760
with the spirit of Ed Gein,
we wholeheartedly believe that.

513
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,280
Cindy was able
to tap into his energy.

514
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,880
And with all the information that
we've acquired

515
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,080
and all the knowledge that we now
have,

516
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,600
the next move from here?
I wanna go back to the Ed Gein farm.

517
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,960
We're on the way to the Gein Farm. I
truly believe his spirit,

518
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,880
his energy is plaguing and haunting
the town of Plainfield.

519
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,640
And especially, of course,
his nature of targeting women.

520
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,520
We're also feeling the power

521
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,240
of everything that's been said
about him for so many years.

522
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,200
Nobody can forget this guy's name.

523
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,280
His legacy is burned and just seared

524
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,960
into the minds, actually,
of millions. Mm-hm.

525
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,200
This is about as evil
as anything could be.

526
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,920
We've got everything set up.

527
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,600
I've got the spirit box
located back there.

528
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,480
Right here is the Ovulus.

529
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,960
Over here I've got the REM pod
set up on that stand.

530
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:31,360
And, of course, the trigger
item, which is the antifreeze can,

531
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,760
basically what Ed Gein used to
falsely gain Bernice's trust

532
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:38,240
to go into Worden's Hardware store
when he murdered her.

533
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:44,240
Man, this dark here, it is dark.
I'm telling you, it is dark here.

534
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,480
It's like you can feel...

535
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,800
That feeling of being watched
right now is so intense.

536
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,760
I feel like...

537
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,360
Oh... Oh, that's interesting.

538
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:08,280
His mother never let him have a
voice or...or a thought of his own.

539
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,920
It was always from her,
it was always what she said.

540
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
He never had a voice.

541
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,240
She was the true evil.
She's really evil.

542
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,840
And I keep feeling like she would
say things like,

543
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:31,120
"I'm gonna get the demons
out of you. The demons out of you."

544
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,440
Right, like already he grew up
thinking he was evil

545
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:38,520
and women were evil. Everything
around him is evil except her,

546
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:42,480
so, you know...
But she's really evil, the mom.

547
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,400
As a young child, I...
I'm sad for him.

548
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,840
I'm sad for him.

549
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,400
Because I don't think he was...

550
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,800
I don't think he was born this way.

551
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,880
You think he was created?

552
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,000
I...I feel like
she created a monster.

553
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,640
All right, spirit box session.

554
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,240
Ed, are you here?

555
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,080
Major interference.

556
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,160
Come on, Ed, come through.

557
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,640
I don't know what the hell's
happening right now.

558
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,240
This thing is just completely fried!

559
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,680
Just like at the jail,

560
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,200
as soon as I turn on my Mel Meter,
instantly it began going crazy

561
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:51,000
with tons of readings.
Something is definitely here,

562
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,200
something is trying to communicate
with us.

563
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,040
I wanna see if Cindy can do
an automatic writing session

564
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:59,880
and try to tap into and make some
form of communication and contact

565
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,960
with the same spirit.

566
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,800
OK.

567
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,160
Ed Gein,
are you here with us right now?

568
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,920
He wanders the fields...

569
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,840
..in search of her body.

570
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:40,280
I feel like I'm gonna throw up,
I'm getting really, really nervous.

571
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,360
Like, I don't feel good.

572
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,440
OK.

573
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,480
Oh.

574
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:55,160
He will not leave this field or
this town until she is with him,

575
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,600
like he wants to be near his mom.

576
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,200
It feels evil. It feels really evil.

577
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:04,240
It feels just evil. And every time
I feel into the mother,

578
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,960
it just feels so dark!

579
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:14,080
I started feeling how much of an
effect Ed's mom, Augusta,

580
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,720
had on him and it was overwhelming.

581
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,040
For a moment there,
I just really had empathy for Ed,

582
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,080
because I knew
that he had been abused.

583
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:26,520
I knew that his mother...
really hurt him.

584
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:30,360
It's as if I was looking through
Ed's eyes and through his emotions,

585
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:35,520
and I knew that everything that he
did...was for his mother.

586
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,800
I think it's time to use the GeoPort

587
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,400
and see if Ed
or his mother will speak to us.

588
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,800
Ed Gein, are you here?

589
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,960
Communicate with me.

590
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
What is your name?

591
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,400
Gein.

592
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,480
It said Gein.

593
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,680
Why did you kill Bernice Worden?

594
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,440
Ed. Does it. Mom.

595
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,880
Ed. Does it. Mom.

596
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,200
Augusta, are you present?

597
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,680
Be gone. Female voice, be gone.

598
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,680
If you have that intelligence,
prove it.

599
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,600
What is my name?

600
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,680
Steve.

601
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,200
What is my friend's name that came
with me?

602
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,480
Cindy.

603
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,160
It just said Cindy.

604
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:52,080
Augusta, we would like to
communicate with you. Are you here?

605
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,360
Here. It said here.

606
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:01,520
Are you OK
with us being on the property?

607
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,960
Stay out.

608
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:10,200
Why would you want Ed to hurt women?

609
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,560
Demon.

610
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,800
Now I'm asking him in my mind,

611
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,040
where are the rest of the women
that you killed?

612
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:25,040
Where are the rest of the bodies?
Like where are they?

613
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:34,040
"There were 12...that died.

614
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,080
He took...

615
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,080
..the 11th...

616
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,000
to the barn."

617
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,160
Oh, God!

618
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,960
I can't...
I don't even want to see this.

619
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,560
He made her wear
his mother's necklace.

620
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,480
Like he would actually
take his mother's things

621
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,320
and put them on these women.

622
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,280
Oh!

623
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,920
Oh, God!

624
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,960
I can't...
I don't even wanna see this.

625
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,040
This is too much.

626
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,240
Dude, this is a lot.

627
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:26,680
Like, this is so...
this is so intense.

628
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,680
I'm not surprised Cindy is
having such a strong reaction

629
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,000
to the atrocities
Ed committed on this property.

630
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:40,280
After his arrest, Gein admitted that
he didn't just sew the suit

631
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,680
to bring his mother
back from the grave,

632
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:46,880
he wanted to crawl inside it
and actually become his mother.

633
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,960
Ed's bizarre behaviour
raises so many questions.

634
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,680
Did he kill and dismember women

635
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:55,200
because his mother taught him
they were evil?

636
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,920
Was his gruesome craft project
some type of offering to her?

637
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,280
And why wear the skin suit?
To feel his mother's love

638
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,240
or somehow
revel in her power over him?

639
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,320
Honestly, it's gonna take me a while
to shake this location.

640
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,720
Yeah, it's draining.
I think at this point

641
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:17,280
there's no question that we both
came in contact with Ed Gein,

642
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,760
his mother Augusta, that's clear.

643
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:22,640
Tomorrow, I wanna go
to the Plainfield Cemetery.

644
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,160
That's where both of their bodies
are laid to rest

645
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,680
and I think that's where we
need to go. Yeah.

646
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,320
Tonight, um...

647
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,560
..is just really tough.

648
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,520
To see what Ed did to these women
and to see...

649
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:47,080
..how evil this was,
it's just pure evil.

650
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,560
And, you know, I'm supposed to open
myself up

651
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:56,880
to experience the things in a case
so I can sense what happened,

652
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,960
but I just don't feel safe doing
that any more at all.

653
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,160
While using the GeoPort to
investigate,

654
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:05,960
voices were coming through the
device that would lead us to believe

655
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:09,640
that Augusta Gein, Ed's mother,
was responsible, in a sense,

656
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,640
for these murders.
That she was urging and wanting Ed

657
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,400
to kill these poor, innocent women.

658
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:18,960
At this point, I wanna put more
focus on Augusta

659
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,840
and go out to the cemetery
where she's buried,

660
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,520
where the locals claim to actually
see a female apparition,

661
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,640
possibly her apparition.

662
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:30,360
And I wanna dig into more of her
story to find out

663
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,880
could Augusta Gein
really be responsible?

664
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,880
Was she influencing Ed
to commit these atrocities?

665
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:43,080
Cindy, we're getting very close
to the Plainfield Cemetery.

666
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:46,080
I'm gonna go meet with my contact,
Dave, who's a local here.

667
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,200
He's gonna show me where Ed Gein's
unmarked grave actually is.

668
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,640
And I know you like to go into these
cases blind,

669
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,520
so I'll just have you
kind of sit here in the truck.

670
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,400
That's better for me.
This is a well-known case,

671
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:00,840
but I want to go in as blind
as possible,

672
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:03,600
and if I know what people
have been experiencing,

673
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,440
it might affect what I receive.

674
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,280
So it's better that I just get
what I get. All right, excellent.

675
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:12,600
The Plainfield, Wisconsin Cemetery
is an eerie place.

676
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:16,160
In one row, you can find Ed Gein,
his brother, Henry,

677
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,640
his mother, Augusta, his father,

678
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,720
and just a mere 50 yards away

679
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,080
is the grave of Ed Gein's victim,
Bernice Worden.

680
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:32,040
Night two of our investigation,

681
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,440
and Plainfield historian,
Dave Bignell,

682
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:37,960
has agreed to meet me at the
cemetery on the outskirts of town.

683
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,160
So, Dave, how long have you lived
in this area?

684
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,840
I've lived in this area my entire
life.

685
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:47,320
There is a lotta...
history in this cemetery.

686
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,640
Ed is buried
amongst a lot of his victims,

687
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,200
a lot of the people that he dug up.

688
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,600
So, this is where
Ed was laid to rest.

689
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,880
You notice his headstone is gone.

690
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:01,640
That's because people would come in
and chip away at it.

691
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:05,440
People come in here, steal some
dirt, maybe do some occult stuff.

692
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,480
Black magic? Absolutely. Yeah,
that would be my first thought.

693
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,480
That's very unusual to see
all the hair

694
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,520
and tufts of different feathers.

695
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:19,240
In addition
to killing Mary Hogan in 1954

696
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,880
and Bernice Worden in 1957,

697
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:26,200
Gein admitted to digging up corpses
of at least nine middle-aged women

698
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:30,800
from three cemeteries in the
Plainfield area, including this one.

699
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:37,440
After carrying a body home,
Ed would get to work,

700
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,920
harvesting the raw materials he
needed for his gruesome creations.

701
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,360
It was the skin he treasured most,

702
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:48,320
carefully removing it,
then tanning it like leather.

703
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:53,360
Gein's women suit
may have been his showpiece,

704
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:56,560
but he also was obsessed
with his victims' faces,

705
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:01,520
peeling them from their skulls
to create a series of human masks.

706
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,680
This is his brother, that he
is considered to have killed,

707
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:13,040
although he was
never charged with it.

708
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,120
And his mother...

709
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,040
..whom he wanted
to raise from the dead.

710
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:25,680
Once again, Dave is confirming
theories that we've learned so far.

711
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,160
One, that Ed
was obsessed with his mother

712
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,760
and wanted to bring her back
from the dead.

713
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:37,160
'Rise!' And two, he heard voices,
possibly his mother's voice,

714
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:40,040
instructing him
to kill and rob graves.

715
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:00,640
Dave, do the locals really believe
that this cemetery is haunted?

716
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:04,560
The people who will talk about it do
believe that this area's haunted.

717
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,000
If they walk through here
with lights,

718
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:11,200
they see shadows where shadows
shouldn't be, that are moving.

719
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:16,360
They can hear screaming
and wailing, mostly female.

720
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:19,200
With everything that happened over
all those years,

721
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,920
there's a pretty widespread belief
that this is a haunted area.

722
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,920
Do you think the spirit of Augusta
Gein is here in the cemetery?

723
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,280
Absolutely.
It was time to bring in Cindy.

724
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:31,560
But just as I was about to walk to
the car,

725
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:34,040
I realised we weren't alone.

726
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:39,760
We're tired of people like you

727
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,760
coming here and doing this.

728
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,840
You need to leave!

729
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,760
As Dave and I were finishing up
our conversation,

730
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:52,080
some locals were approaching us very
upset at our presence

731
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,200
here at the Plainfield Cemetery.
This is a place of rest.

732
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,000
They have loved ones here

733
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:59,520
and they may even be related
to the victims of Ed Gein.

734
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,400
The wound has not been healed here.

735
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,840
I can understand
where they're coming from.

736
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,960
So, out of respect for them, we're
just gonna leave

737
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:10,280
and see if Cindy can do some
remote viewing of the cemetery.

738
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:18,800
Cindy, I know you've got the ability
to tap in with remote viewing.

739
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,400
Now can you kind of explain to me
the process?

740
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:25,760
I'll project myself to the location,
to the cemetery,

741
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:28,400
and see what I feel,
because I don't actually

742
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,960
have to physically be there
to sense what's going on there.

743
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:35,040
OK.
Yeah. OK.

744
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:48,880
When it comes to the location
of his grave,

745
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,840
something has definitely
been changed

746
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,720
that's not just
his stone being moved.

747
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,360
There's another piece
that's missing,

748
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,960
there's another piece that I feel
is hidden from the public.

749
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,200
Something's different.

750
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,320
I'm just sensing that...

751
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:15,480
Ed doesn't feel
he's actually with his mother.

752
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:19,960
Even in death...
Ed dug up bodies from graves.

753
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:25,440
Wow! That's interesting.

754
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:28,640
I see him in this attempt

755
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:33,360
to lay down next to her and hug her.

756
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:37,440
It's almost like he wants to get in
the grave with her

757
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,520
and hold her.

758
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,600
Like if he had actually gotten her
out of the grave.

759
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,440
He used to brush his mother's hair.

760
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:50,040
There's something with that,

761
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:53,000
cos I see him
wanting to brush her hair.

762
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,160
Oh, man!

763
00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:00,560
And then the sense I get is...
every woman that he killed,

764
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,960
it's like an offering to his mother.

765
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,400
Like, "See what I did Mom?
See. Look.

766
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:08,560
This is for you.
I'm doing this for you."

767
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,760
It's all for her.
It's all for Mother.

768
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,840
After she died...

769
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:15,880
Mother, I'm here.

770
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:18,760
..he would have conversations with
her in his mind.

771
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:21,240
In his mind, he was still living
with his mother?

772
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,320
He's still living with his mother.

773
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,800
Like the movie Psycho got it right.

774
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,640
That's exactly it.

775
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,440
Do you really believe that Gein

776
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:35,960
thought he could raise
his mom from the dead?

777
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:39,640
I don't feel he thought he
could raise her from the dead

778
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:42,800
and that
she would start talking again.

779
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:47,080
I feel like...
he couldn't be without her.

780
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:50,320
The absence of her,
he couldn't handle.

781
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:55,400
I sense...on that cemetery...

782
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,640
..he was feeling
something was also watching him.

783
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,360
His eyes would go black.

784
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,560
I don't feel that he...

785
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,240
..even knew
what was happening to him.

786
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,760
In his psych evaluation,
Ed Gein said

787
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:20,560
he doesn't remember digging up
bodies in graveyards

788
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,400
or killing Bernice Worden
and Mary Hogan,

789
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,160
as if he were in a daze.

790
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:28,040
So, what caused him
to commit such atrocities?

791
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:30,040
Did the spirit of Ed's mother

792
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,680
control him as much in death
as in life?

793
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:35,360
Did he hear Augusta's voice
instructing him

794
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,000
to make a woman suit out of corpses?

795
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:41,360
Did Ed create that suit
to become his mother?

796
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:46,800
Finally, did the abuse he suffered
as a child make him hate women?

797
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,840
I do have the GeoPort set up here

798
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:54,200
because I had so much action on it
at the farm.

799
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:57,520
I was wondering if you'd wanna
this time participate with me.

800
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:00,920
Absolutely. Needless to say,
you've tapped into the energy

801
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,240
of Ed, Augusta, numerous times
since we've been together.

802
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,040
And like you said,

803
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:09,640
even just speaking about them
in this community, they're here. Hm.

804
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:12,760
So, I feel like,
with the GeoPort right now,

805
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,840
we could try
to get some more answers,

806
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:16,880
see what we get,
try to connect some dots.

807
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,080
Mm-hm. Yeah, let's do it.

808
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,160
All right.

809
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:27,560
Ed, did you take some of the body
parts and bury them on your land?

810
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:34,440
Mound.
The mound! Mound.

811
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:37,760
You had mentioned right at the
beginning of the investigation

812
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:41,480
on the farm that you thought there
were more bodies on the land.

813
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:44,160
Was there like a mound or something?

814
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,680
I keep... I keep seeing it,

815
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,280
but I keep feeling
there are bodies buried there.

816
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:51,520
There's bodies buried there.

817
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:55,280
This is so crazy it. I don't know,
now I'm getting chills.

818
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:59,160
I don't know, but something drove
him to use those bodies

819
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:01,360
and put them back into the earth.

820
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:05,920
Ed, are there more bodies buried on
the farm that weren't discovered?

821
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:13,520
Possessed? Did you hear that? I did.
It sounded like "possessed". Yeah.

822
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:16,480
Who was possessed?

823
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:21,360
Ed.

824
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,760
It says "possessed".

825
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:26,800
We say, who is possessed? "Ed".

826
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:37,520
I swear it just said,
"Put on the suit."

827
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,760
Really?
That's what I heard.

828
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:45,480
Are you talking about what you used
to put on, Ed?

829
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:47,560
Wearing other people's skin?

830
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,920
Oh, my God!

831
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,240
I got chills like...

832
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:05,800
When you try to enter the mind of Ed
Gein, it's a terrifying place.

833
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,880
It's very terrifying.

834
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:15,000
Because this is such a pivotal
moment in the investigation,

835
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:18,640
I wanted to listen to see what we
had captured, one more time.

836
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:21,000
I've got a lot of things queued up
here on my laptop

837
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:23,600
that I wanna play you from the
remote viewing session.

838
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,880
The GeoPort, a lot of different
voices will come through it

839
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,640
and sometimes spirits will actually
step over each other,

840
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:32,120
so when you go back
and really listen,

841
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:35,320
you'll hear things that we couldn't
hear at the time. Right.

842
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:38,560
So, I wanna go ahead
and play you some of these.

843
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:48,960
Oh, my God!
I hear...

844
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,720
"Put on the suit".

845
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,800
That was so clear.
And of course,

846
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:56,040
we know Ed Gein had a skin suit that
he would put on.

847
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:59,120
It's a female voice,
as if Augusta's saying,

848
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,240
"Ed, put on the suit".
Put on the suit.

849
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:08,040
Everything that he was doing...
was to get his mother's love.

850
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,960
He's looked at as a monster.

851
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:16,400
Is that the lack of empathy
of a psychopath,

852
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,400
or is there
something greater at work?

853
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,280
He was influenced,
but had no idea he was influenced.

854
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,040
Hearing the words, "put on the
suit."

855
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:32,760
I mean, this kind of evidence
is unheard of.

856
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:37,080
Ed literally wanted the female suit
so he could become his mother.

857
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,360
I mean, it's just sick.

858
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,960
This investigation
just keeps getting creepier.

859
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:46,120
I was just contacted by a local
Plainfield resident

860
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,520
who claims he purchased an item
at auction

861
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,840
that he believes
belonged to Ed Gein

862
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:55,440
and will blow our minds. He's never
shown anyone this object before.

863
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:07,480
I'm really excited
to head to Tom's house.

864
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:10,360
He's a local resident here
and I got a tip that he has

865
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:13,920
some pretty interesting artifacts
of high interest to this case.

866
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,040
So we're gonna head there right now.
I'm really looking forward to seeing

867
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:20,360
if you can kind of tap into
the items he has

868
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:24,080
and see if you can connect any dots.
I can do what's called psychometry.

869
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:29,120
So, I can hold an object and sense
the memory attached to the object

870
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:32,080
or the emotions
attached to the object.

871
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:38,000
Well, this is my house.

872
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:42,000
A lot of antiques here, huh?
Yeah.

873
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:52,760
Cindy, Tom has some very interesting
artifacts that he has set out here,

874
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:56,200
and I would just like you to see if
you can sense anything.

875
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,200
Skinning.
Skinning.

876
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,480
It's something
involved in that process.

877
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:14,120
You couldn't have been
more accurate.

878
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:20,960
Here are two knives that Tom
believes belonged to Ed Gein.

879
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:24,760
Do you think that these items
were used by Ed Gein?

880
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:27,960
It feels like
there's memory attached to it.

881
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:38,600
And I feel like there's some...
something was feeling...

882
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:41,960
like there would've been evil
brought into the house

883
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:43,960
or something dark.

884
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:46,640
So, Tom, let me ask you how did you
acquire these items?

885
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:50,440
What's the story behind these?
There was an auction that came up,

886
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:54,080
my wife and I started bidding on.
We're antique collectors.

887
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:56,680
so they're antiques
and they've got history,

888
01:02:56,760 --> 01:03:00,120
so it's nice to have 'em. The items
that you got from the auction,

889
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:03,240
you get 'em back to the house here
and what happens next?

890
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:05,320
Well, I put 'em in the garage

891
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:08,000
and we didn't have any problems for
a few weeks,

892
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:13,760
and then, suddenly, I started seeing
a shadow, a tall skinny shadow

893
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:17,240
going from the garage door,
past the TV and the fireplace

894
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:19,240
and outside of the house.

895
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:24,000
But then the birds started getting
sick and dying, two a day.

896
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:27,560
The rest of my animals
died after that.

897
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:31,600
My ma died.
Then my dad died on Father's Day,

898
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:34,960
and then my wife
died on the following Christmas.

899
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:37,280
Do you think these items
are responsible

900
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:39,920
for all the tragic
deaths in your family?

901
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,800
Most definitely.

902
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:51,000
Well, Tom, Cindy's definitely
picking up on a presence

903
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:53,760
and picking up on a lot of
information that you confirmed.

904
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:56,240
I think we need to start
investigating right away,

905
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:59,240
if that's OK with you.
That'd be great. OK.

906
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,640
Our goal's to figure out

907
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:05,320
if these objects that belonged
to Ed Gein are cursed as well.

908
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:08,920
I got Jaime now
with the SLS system set up.

909
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,080
I've got the Mel Meter,
I got the REM pod,

910
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:14,120
motion detector set up there.
Two K2 meters.

911
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:16,400
I think we should just start.

912
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:19,040
Ed Gein, are you present with us?

913
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:22,000
Did you use these objects?

914
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:30,680
Dude!

915
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:32,440
Ed, is that you?

916
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:40,440
Ed, are these your personal items?

917
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:45,240
What the hell?!

918
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:50,400
It's like right in front
of the sensor.

919
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:56,080
Mel Meter's going off,
we're picking up motion detection,

920
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:59,280
and something is near the Mel Meter
on this side of the room.

921
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:03,480
Where is at, Jaime?
Is it on this side? Yes.

922
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:08,240
Ed...I'm gonna take your item here,

923
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:10,360
I'm gonna set it on this chair.

924
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:12,600
Now, if that's yours,

925
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:14,680
let us know.

926
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:18,720
If that's truly yours,
can you come stand by here?

927
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,280
I feel a male...presence.

928
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:25,080
Dude, Cindy, I'm not trying to freak
you out,

929
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:27,680
the fur on your coat just went down
a little bit here.

930
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:31,200
I don't think a draft did that.
It just kind of went like this.

931
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:34,800
Did you feel anything? No,
I can just feel this presence near.

932
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:39,360
I can feel it coming. There's a man
like breathing down my neck.

933
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:41,440
I swear to God.

934
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,880
I feel like there's a man breathing.

935
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:48,200
Are you serious?

936
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:51,800
Oh, my God!

937
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,400
Right now?

938
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:03,640
The activity is second to none here.

939
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:06,600
I mean...every meter, the SLS,

940
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:09,400
we ask it to come to the knife if
it's Gein. "If this is you,

941
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:12,040
come to your weapon."
I'm just freaked out even more

942
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:14,480
because we were shown this last
night. I know.

943
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:16,800
Everything you were saying
last night

944
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,280
is all coming together right here.
Yeah.

945
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:22,200
He's with us everywhere we go.
He's everywhere.

946
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:26,360
Last night, we heard a voice
say, "Put on the suit."

947
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:29,160
Today, Cindy confirms
that this was the knife

948
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:31,600
that Ed Gein used to make that suit.

949
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:34,720
It's almost as if Gein
is following us all over town.

950
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:37,440
And he definitely
wants his knife back.

951
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:41,280
Tom, you have
one of the most active homes

952
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:44,640
I have ever investigated
in my life, first and foremost,

953
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,680
but I don't need to tell you that.

954
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:50,120
I usually keep these out in
the shed because, you know,

955
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:53,520
after the animals started dying
and people getting sick,

956
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:56,720
you know, seeing the shadow running
back and forth,

957
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:59,680
I decided, "Out in the shed.
You can go outside."

958
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,840
Would you consider letting us borrow
this item

959
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:06,560
to take it to the farm
for our final investigation? Yeah.

960
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:10,000
I think I'll be OK with that.
OK. We'll definitely return it,

961
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:12,480
cos I have no plans on adding this
to my collection.

962
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:15,040
And I'm not taking it
with me anywhere.

963
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:25,560
At this point, I'd like to go back

964
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:28,040
to the
Waushara County Historical Society

965
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:30,160
and really kind of dig into the
archives,

966
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:32,600
speak to somebody about the history
of the property.

967
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:34,600
What happened on this land?

968
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:43,760
So, Lori, of course you know we're
here conducting an investigation

969
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:45,360
about the Ed Gein farm.

970
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:49,040
And Cindy immediately upon
stepping up on that land

971
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:51,120
starting having a lot of visuals.

972
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:54,400
She was really picking up on

973
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:57,480
spiritual energy
coming from the land itself.

974
01:07:57,560 --> 01:08:00,160
And she thinks it goes back before
the Geins moved there.

975
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:04,560
I felt immediately
a Native American history

976
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:08,720
attached to the land. So I knew that
there was something connected.

977
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:10,880
And then I kept seeing...

978
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:14,000
I call them night walkers.

979
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:16,160
There's something about
these spirits

980
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:18,400
connected
to the Native American culture

981
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:20,240
that walk ton he land at night.

982
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:23,960
What type of history can you tell us
about Ed Gein's property

983
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:27,280
far before the Geins
actually purchased the acreage?

984
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:30,960
The Black Hawk War of 1832

985
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:35,440
was in this area between several
different tribes

986
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,840
and the US military.

987
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:42,040
It was a very tragic war
and it's estimated

988
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:46,320
that between 400 and 600
Native Americans were killed.

989
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:49,000
And when Native Americans
were buried,

990
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:52,000
they were always buried in...
mounds..

991
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:55,160
..throughout the whole state.

992
01:08:55,880 --> 01:09:01,480
The battle happened right around
where Ed Gein's farm stands today.

993
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:05,680
And now the Ho-Chunk tribe

994
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:09,680
is the largest...
in the Wisconsin area.

995
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:12,800
Lori, with all this information
and learning about this battle,

996
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:15,960
do you think they could have left
some type of residue on the land?

997
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:19,360
Or something causing the paranormal
activity taking place today?

998
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:21,440
Yes, definitely.

999
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:27,280
All Waushara County has a lot
of residue from the battles.

1000
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:30,280
Do you think Plainfield, Wisconsin,
is haunted?

1001
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:32,360
Yes...totally.

1002
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:37,600
I suggest you talk
to one of the Ho-Chunk elders,

1003
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:40,520
they'll know a lot more of the land.

1004
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:46,760
So receiving that information was
critical and absolutely amazing.

1005
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:55,960
I would like to get the perspective
from a local tribe,

1006
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:59,600
maybe seek out an elder, get some
information about their history,

1007
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:02,120
and find out
what could these spirits be.

1008
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:04,560
Why is there so much unrest?

1009
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:08,560
Cindy, right now we're about to meet
with Brother Thundercloud,

1010
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:11,480
who is an elder
in the Ho-Chunk tribe in this area.

1011
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:14,480
And he's going to tell us more
about the land, their cultures,

1012
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:17,800
and their beliefs to see if that can
shed some light on this case

1013
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:21,200
and even some of the visions
you were having in this area.

1014
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:28,680
When God created Earth,
God created the human beings.

1015
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:31,760
There were also spirits
that were created.

1016
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:35,920
And these spirits
are in everything that we see.

1017
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,160
You know, this sand, this water,

1018
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:42,720
the rocks, the trees, the leaves,

1019
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,640
you know, they're all spiritual.

1020
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:49,600
When we were walking on the land
at Ed Gein's farm,

1021
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:54,280
I walked on it and I knew
I was standing on...sacred land.

1022
01:10:56,760 --> 01:11:00,160
I became aware of these spirits
that looked like shadows.

1023
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:03,400
And I kept hearing "night walkers".

1024
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:06,600
Do you have anything similar to that
in Ho-Chunk culture?

1025
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:10,200
There are...
what we'd call night spirits.

1026
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:13,800
These night spirits are not...
not all bad.

1027
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:16,960
Our term for spirits is.

1028
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:21,280
It's just plain spirit. They go
about in order to protect us.

1029
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:27,080
There are...good ones
and there are...bad ones.

1030
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:31,280
Bad spirit.

1031
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:35,160
I mean, Ed Gein, and his mother,

1032
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:37,640
they brought a lot of darkness
to that land,

1033
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:40,800
so maybe we were dealing with the
protective good night walkers

1034
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:43,120
that were just trying to protect.

1035
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:45,720
We do believe in
good and evil spirits.

1036
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,640
They do exist.

1037
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:50,880
And do you believe those spirits
are still on Earth here today?

1038
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:52,800
Oh, yes, they're here.

1039
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:57,480
Brother Thundercloud told us

1040
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:01,080
that night walkers could be good
and like soldiers on a the land,

1041
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:05,440
or they could be evil. So what are
we dealing with on the Gein farm?

1042
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:08,960
Is it good...or evil?

1043
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:12,200
Knowing this information
can help us decipher

1044
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:15,320
what's going on at the Gein farm.
So we definitely need to go back

1045
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:18,000
and figure out what the heck
is going on?

1046
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:24,680
Walking into
the final investigation,

1047
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:28,000
we know that Ed Gein's mom, Augusta,
is part of this haunting.

1048
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:30,200
And we know that Ed's here.

1049
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:33,160
Ed Gein is everywhere in Plainfield,

1050
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:34,920
but many questions remain.

1051
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:39,960
Was Augusta influencing Ed to murder
Bernice and Mary and rob the graves?

1052
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:42,760
Are Ed's victims still here with us,

1053
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:46,520
or have they peacefully
crossed on to the other side?

1054
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:49,600
We have no idea
what's about to happen.

1055
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:05,560
Right now,
we're at the Ed Gein farm.

1056
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,320
This is the final night
of investigation.

1057
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:18,960
We are here for answers.
We have two trigger objects,

1058
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:22,440
the knife we believe
Ed Gein used on his victims,

1059
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:25,480
and also we have a Bible
to see if Augusta's spirit

1060
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,920
will respond to that specifically.

1061
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,960
And what's more,
this is a special night.

1062
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:34,120
This is the anniversary tonight

1063
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:36,920
when the police
converged on the farm here...

1064
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,120
..and found Bernice Worden's body

1065
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,640
when Ed Gein
was discovered and caught.

1066
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,520
63 years ago tonight.

1067
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:50,400
We're gonna do whatever it takes
to find out what is going on.

1068
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:54,160
I have the GeoPort set up,
the REM pod and the Ovulus.

1069
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:58,360
So, Cindy, what I would really like
you to do tonight

1070
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:00,440
is try to tap in as much as you can,

1071
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:04,320
see if you can find out any answers
about the land,

1072
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,760
Augusta possibly influencing Ed,

1073
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:09,800
and tell me what you're seeing and
what you're sensing.

1074
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:17,000
What are you seeing? I see him
just killing these women...

1075
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:22,000
..and then having dinner,
like nothing happened.

1076
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:24,640
Honestly, I'm sensing...

1077
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:27,480
so much energy
coming towards my chest.

1078
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:36,360
Really?!

1079
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,640
That's...insane.

1080
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:44,840
REM pod hit.

1081
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:47,080
Just like at Tom Dyar's house.

1082
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:50,720
Right now?

1083
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:57,360
I feel his mother.

1084
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:01,280
I feel her everywhere.

1085
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:03,560
All I can hear are screams.

1086
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:06,680
I'm hearing, "The witch is back.
The witch is back."

1087
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:09,080
Turn this on.
So you think Augusta's here?

1088
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:11,160
Yeah. Turn it on.

1089
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:14,560
I can... Augusta!

1090
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:17,520
Augusta. Augusta, is that you?

1091
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,680
Are you here?

1092
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:23,800
Here. It just...

1093
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:25,880
Ed.

1094
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:33,920
Can you tell us what this object is?

1095
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,360
What is this? Tell us.

1096
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:43,000
A knife. Did it say knife?
I heard it. It said "a knife".

1097
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:48,120
I just felt like somebody running...

1098
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:50,960
up towards my, like, spine.

1099
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:55,000
And like slicing down...
like down my spine.

1100
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:57,240
Like you would be gutting something.

1101
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:01,880
That's what he did to Bernice Worden
and likely to Mary Hogan as well.

1102
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:07,000
After Gein's arrest,
he told a psychiatrist

1103
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:11,440
about a childhood incident in which
he watched his mother butcher a pig

1104
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,520
and remembered feeling aroused.

1105
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:20,280
In his mind,
the act of dismemberment

1106
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:23,720
may have been associated
with pleasure ever since.

1107
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:39,360
Did that childhood memory
contribute...

1108
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:45,040
..to Ed Gein's gruesome hobby?

1109
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:58,960
It's back on the knife again?
It's trying to touch...

1110
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:01,040
How is this happening? This knife?

1111
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:03,440
It's exactly what was happening
at Tom's house.

1112
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:06,640
I've never experienced anything
like this ever.

1113
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:13,960
That just said "demonic"
loud and clear. 100%.

1114
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:17,640
What is demonic?

1115
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:20,600
Tell us.

1116
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:22,680
Be gone.

1117
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:27,520
What is demonic?

1118
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,520
That sounded like...I heard Satan.

1119
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:35,000
This is really...bad.

1120
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:37,080
Ed, we wanna hear from you.

1121
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:39,280
Why did you hurt those women?

1122
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:44,200
He said Augusta. Ed, did your mother

1123
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:47,520
influence you
to do these horrific things?

1124
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,720
Learn your lesson, boy!

1125
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:58,800
Yes.
Are you feeling anything right now?

1126
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:01,320
Is it right on my back?
Yes.

1127
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:07,760
Ed, are you standing
next to Cindy right now?

1128
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:14,920
I just saw him. I just saw an image
of him charge towards me

1129
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:19,240
and go for my neck. Just go...
go for my neck, choking me!

1130
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:22,880
That's exactly what it was doing
on the SLS camera. Choking me!

1131
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:28,800
Are you trying to hurt Cindy
the way you hurt those women?

1132
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:34,000
I feel really bad.

1133
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,200
I...I feel really bad.

1134
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:39,160
I seriously can...
All I can hear are screams.

1135
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:48,080
That was a woman crying!

1136
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:51,760
That's exactly what you described.

1137
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,880
You think you were seeing
one of Ed's victims? Yes!

1138
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:00,840
I just keep hearing, like,

1139
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:04,840
"Their souls are crying. Their souls
are crying. Their souls are crying."

1140
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:07,160
Like...
Like they're trapped here.

1141
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:12,240
I hear them.

1142
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:14,840
What is that?
Do you hear that woman?!

1143
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:17,600
Are you
one of the victims of Ed Gein?

1144
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:23,800
Mary. That was one of Ed's victims.
Oh, my God!

1145
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:26,040
Mary Hogan.

1146
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:28,160
Three years before killing Bernice,

1147
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:30,840
Ed fatally shot Mary Hogan
at her tavern,

1148
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:34,880
then beheaded and butchered her
just yards from where we are now.

1149
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:40,000
Could her spirit
still be trapped here today?

1150
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:42,720
Mary, are you present?

1151
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:48,440
Something is on the Bible?

1152
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:04,920
Augusta, is that you?

1153
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,280
Going for the Bible?
That's not Augusta.

1154
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:10,600
It's one of the women.

1155
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:13,360
And it said Mary.

1156
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:17,000
Mary, are you present?

1157
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:26,120
This is crazy!

1158
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:30,240
It's real.
It's real. It's real.

1159
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,920
What's real? Could this be Mary?

1160
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,760
Ed? Augusta? or all three?

1161
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:42,560
The activity is off the charts!

1162
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:48,440
I hate this place so much.

1163
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:52,120
I feel like we're in hell. It's bad.
I didn't know it was cold.

1164
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:55,000
I'm telling you,
if we stay on this land much longer,

1165
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:57,120
it's really gonna start
to affect us.

1166
01:20:57,200 --> 01:21:01,120
Your mind will be twisted if you
stay on this land much longer.

1167
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:04,440
This is not a place to spend
a lot of time. This is not safe. No.

1168
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:06,200
We can't take that risk.

1169
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:08,480
I know we're dealing with
something really dark.

1170
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:10,560
You can be tricked and think

1171
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:12,920
you're dealing with your loved ones
on this land,

1172
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,600
but it's definitely not your loved
ones. You see what I'm saying? I do.

1173
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:19,360
What you're describing is evil.
It's evil.

1174
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:23,160
It's...it's not good. If you're
seeing that and this is happening,

1175
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:26,400
I don't know if we should continue.
I wanna get the hell out of here.

1176
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:28,600
All right, we're done,
for our safety. Yeah.

1177
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:30,800
This is not good.
Let's go. Let get out of here.

1178
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,880
Everybody else, wrap it up.

1179
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:40,400
We caught anomalies
again reaching for the knife.

1180
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:45,080
Words like demonic, Satan...
coming out of the GeoPort.

1181
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:47,600
I'm hearing, "The witch is back".

1182
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:49,800
We heard wailing and crying.

1183
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:52,160
Cindy was seeing Gein's victims.

1184
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:56,640
And, of course, this is the
anniversary of when Gein was caught.

1185
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:59,480
It is not safe for us
to be here any more.

1186
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:01,960
All of us
are getting out of here now.

1187
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:09,360
The final investigation at the
farm was super intense.

1188
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:11,560
We caught evidence that, honestly,

1189
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:14,080
is probably
some of the best of my career.

1190
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:35,520
I really feel more affected
by this case

1191
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:39,280
than any case
I have ever worked on in my career.

1192
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:42,360
Throughout our investigation, we
sought out answers

1193
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:45,600
to the biggest questions
and received compelling evidence.

1194
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:47,960
Ed Gein, are you present with us?

1195
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,760
Dude!

1196
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:55,120
Was this the work of a man
who wanted to become his mother,

1197
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:58,320
wanting the power, hating women,

1198
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:00,560
wanting to BE a woman?

1199
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:04,800
Did Ed create a suit from women's
skin to become his mother?

1200
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:09,240
Did Ed's mother dominate him
as much in death as in life?

1201
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:18,680
Are Ed's victims
trapped on the Gein farm

1202
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:20,960
where he committed
horrific atrocities?

1203
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:23,680
Gein was a sick and disturbed man.

1204
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:27,160
But what drove him
to commit such heinous acts?

1205
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:29,120
Was it strictly mental illness?

1206
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:32,960
I think all of these things together
make the haunting.

1207
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:36,320
And especially if a lot of tragedy
has occurred on the land,

1208
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:38,920
that can create a haunting
all by itself.

1209
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,840
It created, essentially, an evil,
an evil that existed there.

1210
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:48,280
And that evil started not with Ed,
but with his monster of a mother.

1211
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:53,600
The Geins purchase the property,

1212
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:57,800
Augusta actually becomes more angry,
more hateful.

1213
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:08,040
And then we have somebody who is
severely abused and mentally ill.

1214
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:12,720
There are so many different parts
of this case.

1215
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:14,800
It's like a giant pot of soup.

1216
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:20,680
Argh! The effect that Ed had
on the community sadly lingered on

1217
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:22,720
way beyond his initial arrest.

1218
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:34,640
There was no closure
for the longest time,

1219
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:39,520
because he was found mentally insane
and not competent to stand trial.

1220
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:42,640
And when he was finally declared
competent to stand trial,

1221
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:46,680
he was convicted of first-degree
murder for one of his two victims.

1222
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:54,480
People around the world have
actually become fascinated

1223
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:56,360
with the crimes of Ed Gein

1224
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:59,440
and glorified
what he did to his victims.

1225
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:03,760
It literally changed the face
of the horror genre forever.

1226
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:10,120
Mrs Bates. He inspired
Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho.

1227
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:18,240
Characters like Leatherface
from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

1228
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:20,880
He was Buffalo Bill
from The Silence Of The Lambs.

1229
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:25,080
So many movies were made about him
because they're so extreme,

1230
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:27,960
they're so heinous.

1231
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:32,760
Look at this case. Look at Ed Gein
literally committing homicide,

1232
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:36,520
Mutilating corpses, taking their
skin and body parts,

1233
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:40,160
and putting it on his own body.
Wearing a dead skin mask.

1234
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:44,680
Evil is very real. Like,
the movie Psycho got it right.

1235
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:47,720
That's exactly it.

1236
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:54,000
I'm hearing it too. I hear it too.
I was hearing it to.

1237
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:56,640
Weird. I thought that was maybe
one of your chairs.

1238
01:25:56,720 --> 01:26:00,880
Shall we cut for a second? It's
strange, because the tapping to me

1239
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:03,280
sounded like it was
coming from the table.

1240
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:06,840
It was like... That's what I thought
too, but nobody was tapping.

1241
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:09,240
I thought maybe one of you was...
No. No.

1242
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:12,440
Strange. Really strange.
I don't see a source.

1243
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:15,760
It's pretty clear that this case

1244
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:18,680
is still trying to affect us
in some kind of way.

1245
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:21,440
I was hearing it as well. Were you
hearing it? Yeah. Yeah.

1246
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:24,120
In all honesty,
I'm really worried about

1247
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:26,560
what's gonna happen after we leave.

1248
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:32,200
Because...
it seems to be a recurring theme

1249
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:37,240
that once you encounter this energy,
it doesn't really leave you. Right.

1250
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:40,480
Evil exists. Evil is very real.

1251
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:45,040
Plainfield is definitely haunted.

1252
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:50,400
I believe Ed, Augusta,
and possibly Ed's victim, Mary,

1253
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:52,800
are still present in this community.

1254
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:56,200
Plainfield, Wisconsin,
will always be known

1255
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:59,440
for the heinous crimes of Ed Gein.

1256
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:08,600
Before we leave town, Cindy and I
wanna make one last stop

1257
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:13,360
to the Plainfield Cemetery and
pay our respects to Ed's victims.

1258
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:17,240
Bernice Worden is buried here,
while Ed's other victim, Mary Hogan,

1259
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:20,160
is buried
at an undisclosed location.

1260
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:25,400
Bernice, we're terribly sorry
about what took place 63 years ago.

1261
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:29,600
We honour your memory...and we hope
to keep your memory alive.

1262
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:36,440
Although the town itself
has tried to move on,

1263
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:41,240
it's clear that the spirit of both
Augusta and Ed Gein still lurk here

1264
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:44,000
haunting and preying on
the community.

1265
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:46,720
Will their spirits ever be at rest,

1266
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:49,040
or will they wander through
Plainfield

1267
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:52,720
searching for each other
until they are reunited?

1268
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:57,200
Will Plainfield, Wisconsin,
ever be at peace?

1269
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:59,280
