00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:09,939
I had a feeling you’d be here.

17
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,070
It was an uneventful
Thanksgiving in Santa Barbara,

18
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,355
that’s for sure.

19
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,778
You mean your mom didn’t
beg you to stay

20
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,367
and go shopping with her
at 5 a. m.

21
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,792
for the Black Friday sales?

22
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,082
Oh, she did, I just couldn’t
bear the thought

23
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,544
of listening to her decide
between rose gold

24
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,955
or a shiny champagne
wrapping paper.

25
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,207
But let’s be honest,
there is a distinction

26
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:32,548
between a shiny rose gold
and a sparkly, shiny champagne.

27
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,894
An hour‐long distinction?

28
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,890
The answer is always rose gold.

29
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:40,644
Unless the champagne is dusty.

30
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:42,346
Like mother, like daughter.

31
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,727
No. I am finally committing.

32
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:47,653
How’s this for a delicately
stacked holiday dessert spread?

33
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:51,193
Nice. Five sketches in,
you finally figured it out.

34
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,780
‐Good for you, Ame.
‐Don’t tease.

35
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,575
Do you really like it?

36
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,738
Of course. It’s great.
They all were.

37
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:01,497
Anyway, you had the cat in
the bag with these arrangements.

38
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,832
I know, I just think
a client literally named

39
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:07,037
after the holiday, we couldn’t
go light on the florals.

40
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,839
Amy, you’re the only event
designer in the entire city

41
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,513
who could love Christmas
as much as Tiffany Christmas

42
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:13,931
is gonna love
what you’ve created

43
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,429
for her family’s reunion.

44
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,260
Well, we don’t have the job yet.

45
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:20,637
Come Monday morning, we will.

46
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:23,314
Well, what if Frankie
pushes for Greta instead?

47
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,693
Her idea seemed to really
pique his interest, too.

48
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:28,061
Look, yours were clearly
way better.

49
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,860
You can’t just assume Frankie
will have it out for you.

50
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,994
Plus, Tiffany’s gonna
wanna see options,

51
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,360
so really
it’s up to her, anyway.

52
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,279
I don’t know, Kayleigh.

53
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:38,736
After Frankie’s aunt
promoted him,

54
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,577
I kinda feel like he does.

55
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,372
Well, if that’s the case, it’s
only because you’re amazing

56
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,747
and he is threatened
by all your amazingness.

57
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:48,084
‐You think he’s threatened?
‐Hello.

58
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,130
He wishes he could design
like you. You’re like Christmas.

59
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:55,013
Warm apple cider and holiday
cookies, and he’s more like,

60
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:58,342
I don’t know,
the worst of Halloween,

61
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,758
a tasty piece of candy
with a razor in it.

62
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:04,179
His aesthetic
is the worst. Seriously.

63
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,977
Well, he’s running
the show now, so...

64
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:10,772
So you just need to prove to
Tiffany you have what it takes.

65
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:14,779
This year’s ten‐year Christmas
family reunion, it’s all yours.

66
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,241
You know what? You’re right.

67
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:23,584
Frankie Diaz liking my stuff
or not, it is my time to shine.

68
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,374
That a girl.
I think you’re done.

69
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:53,187
Amy, can I see you
in my office, please?

70
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,990
I gotta say,
these are even better

71
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:58,992
than your initial sketches.

72
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,994
Really did an amazing job here.

73
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:02,826
Really? Thank you.

74
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,121
Do you think it’s gonna be
enough for Tiffany to hire us?

75
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,365
Well, I only spoke
with her manager once,

76
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:10,166
but she did say she loved
your original sketches

77
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:13,672
and said she might be leaning
towards us, so we’ll see.

78
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,125
Really? That’s so exciting!

79
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:20,546
But look, Ames, I’ve also gotta
be totally transparent with you.

80
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,295
You know you’re
an incredible event designer

81
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:26,059
and we will use your designs,
but I think I’m gonna be

82
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:29,141
taking on the majority
of the legwork here myself.

83
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,729
I’m sorry, wait.

84
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:34,692
Why would you implement
my designs instead of me?

85
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,486
Because this is a massive gig
for us, Ames.

86
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:41,069
Tiffany Christmas
is an exploding pop star,

87
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,446
and I simply have
more client experience than you.

88
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,913
Or are you just
threatened by me?

89
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:50,365
What? No, that’s not it at all.

90
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:51,749
What do you even mean
threatened?

91
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,593
Oh, come on, ever since
your aunt promoted you,

92
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,209
you’ve had it out for me.

93
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:58,878
She loves my designs.
And you don’t like that, do you?

94
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,877
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Amy.

95
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,509
My auntie
totally trusts my judgment

96
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:05,265
and she loves my designs.

97
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,637
That’s why she promoted me,
clearly.

98
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,694
But I’m on the line now.
I’m only doing what’s best.

99
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:11,941
Or maybe you got promoted

100
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,820
because you threw a fit
to your mom.

101
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:19,239
Ames, the only one who seems to
be throwing a fit here is you.

102
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:22,571
I’m throwing a fit?
Ha‐ha‐ha... No.

103
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:26,367
This is throwing a fit. I quit.

104
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,373
‐Ames, don’t be brash.
‐And I will have...

105
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,583
All of my stuff out by the end
of the day, and that includes

106
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,785
Kayleigh,
if she’ll come with me.

107
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,795
What are you gonna do?
Start your own business?

108
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,549
‐Maybe I will.
‐Okay.

109
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,883
Well, we still own
your designs, you know?

110
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:45,678
‐You made them on our clock.
‐Uh‐huh. Wrong.

111
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,062
You don’t pay me overtime,
so, technically,

112
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,729
I made them off the clock.

113
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,099
Merry Christmas, Mr. Diaz,

114
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:55,807
and a very happy New Year.

115
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,437
‐Ames!
‐And don’t call me Ames!

116
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:00,276
You know I hate that name.

117
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,953
You’re gonna be
all right?

118
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,866
I think so. I’m gonna miss
this work table, though.

119
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,664
We’ll get an all new work table.

120
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,787
Thanks, and thank you
for joining me

121
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,706
on the fun‐employment
front lines.

122
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,293
You know what we need?

123
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,420
‐A spa day.
‐A spa day?

124
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:21,837
I don’t think
that’s the wisest investment

125
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,883
considering it’s the holidays

126
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:27,097
and we have no income.

127
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,508
I think it depends
on where you go.

128
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,936
Well, you were certainly right.
Always go with the rose gold.

129
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,819
Aw, it looks so cute.
I love it.

130
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,066
Let me see yours.

131
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:49,156
I went with, um,
snowflake sparkle.

132
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:52,584
Although I don’t feel
very sparkly right now.

133
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,712
Oh, you will, though. Just wait.

134
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,500
What are you talking about?

135
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,595
‐Thank you.
‐Thank you.

136
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:10,724
And here’s our reason
to celebrate.

137
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,385
What are you talking about?

138
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,194
Wait, is that...

139
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,774
That’s your shot right there.
Go.

140
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,028
‐Excuse me.

141
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:28,664
‐Yeah.
‐Hi.

142
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,412
Sorry,
are you Tiffany Christmas?

143
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:33,332
Yes, I’m Tiffany. And you are?

144
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,411
Amy. Amy Kessler.

145
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,367
I would shake your hand, but‐‐

146
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:40,499
Oh, my gosh,
that is so cute!

147
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,955
‐What color is that?
‐Snowflake sparkle.

148
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:46,836
Oh. Aw, I already had my heart
set on Rudolph Red.

149
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,087
But I’m gonna remember that
for next time.

150
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,467
Oh. Well, Rudolph Red
is an excellent color.

151
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,314
And a perfect color for,
I don’t know,

152
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:57,850
a, um, upcoming family reunion?

153
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:02,056
Um, you’re not some, like,
crazy stalker fan, are you?

154
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,110
’Cause I really can’t deal
with that right now.

155
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,283
No, actually, I was the one
who created your designs

156
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,412
for Diaz Events Design,
you know, the one

157
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:11,071
with the snowflake‐falling
photo booth?

158
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,289
Yes! I absolutely loved
all of your designs.

159
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:19,790
But wait, I thought Frankie
said that you weren’t available.

160
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:23,464
He, he said that he was just
gonna do it himself, I thought.

161
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:27,845
‐Well, I actually am.
‐Oh! Okay, well, perfect!

162
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,224
I’ll just let Frankie know
that I prefer you instead.

163
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,643
Okay, well, um‐‐

164
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:35,931
Yup. We most certainly
are available.

165
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,767
‐I’m Kayleigh, Amy’s assistant.
‐Hi.

166
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,353
We’re such fans
of your new holiday album.

167
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,688
It’s so nice to meet you,
we were listening to it

168
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,733
the whole time we were
designing, and I mean, like,

169
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:47,487
Amy refused to turn it off.

170
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,859
Aww, that’s so sweet. Thank you.

171
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,776
Well, and actually we were
thinking it would be great

172
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,946
if you sang <i>Love Me Like
Christmas</i> at the reunion.

173
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,906
I was thinking of putting,
like, a little stage

174
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,545
in front of the tree.
What do you think?

175
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,871
Yes! I love that idea!

176
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:04,287
Okay, I’m excited now.
Um, can we meet tomorrow?

177
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,459
Tomorrow? Uh, yeah.
That sounds good. Yeah.

178
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,419
Okay, so I’ll pick
a time and place.

179
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,717
Here, put your number
in my phone.

180
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,390
‐Okay.
‐Yay.

181
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,468
Don’t worry.
I’ll take care of Frankie.

182
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:17,467
Just go with it.
Your time to shine, remember?

183
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,929
‐Okay.
‐Mm‐hmm.

184
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,768
‐Here.
‐Okay. Perfect.

185
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:25,114
Um, well, cheers, ladies.

186
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,860
‐Cheers to...
‐A Christmas family reunion.

187
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,533
‐Yes! Cheers.
‐

188
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,296
Thank you.

189
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:59,806
Uh! I have got to get the name
of this window display designer.

190
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,139
Okay.

191
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,150
Okay.

192
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:14,824
Oh, hi. Sorry, I’ve actually
already taken this table.

193
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,158
Uh, so you can
reserve tables here?

194
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,083
‐I didn’t see any little signs.
‐Uh, n‐no.

195
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:23,001
It’s just, well,
I‐I saw this table on the way in

196
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,631
and I was gonna put
my purse down, but...

197
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,458
You know, it’s a little
too close to the door.

198
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:31,014
So you just stacked some, like,
mental claim on this table?

199
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,171
Correct.

200
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,677
I don’t think
that really counts.

201
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,683
We both sat simultaneously.

202
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:43,604
Well, I think I need this table
for a very important meeting.

203
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:45,485
Well, I think I need this table

204
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,522
for a pretty important
meeting, too.

205
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,145
Well, can you find
another great table

206
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,532
for your less important meeting?

207
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,779
Wait. Why is mine
less important?

208
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:58,123
Uh, you said pretty important.
I said very important.

209
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:02,659
Fine. I need this table for
a very important meeting, too.

210
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,205
Well, can you take
your very important meeting

211
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,290
and find a equally great table?

212
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,836
Like, like that one over there.

213
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,800
Um, can’t see the holiday
display or the beautiful view.

214
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:16,303
Okay, can you just be
a gentleman

215
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,594
since it’s the holidays
and, I don’t know,

216
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,850
let a recently unemployed woman
just have her way?

217
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,982
I really need to make
a big impression here today.

218
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,849
You must be Amy Kessler.

219
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,806
Wait. How did you know my name?

220
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,977
I’m Tiffany’s cousin.

221
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,816
Housemate, bestie. You name it.

222
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,696
Tiffany’s cousin?

223
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,740
Wait, where’s Tiffany?

224
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:43,826
‐
‐Oh. There she goes.

225
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,826
"Hi, Amy, I’m so sorry
I couldn’t make it.

226
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,666
I got caught
at the recording studio.

227
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:54,762
My cousin Calvin
will be meeting you.

228
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,839
He’s amazing. You’ll love him."

229
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:02,354
Okay, well, I guess we got off
on the wrong foot then.

230
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,560
You think?

231
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,890
Uh, Amy Kessler, event designer.

232
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,766
Nice to meet you, Mr. Christmas.

233
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,605
It’s nice to meet you, too.

234
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:15,188
So are you a photographer or...

235
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,526
That’s right, I take
all of Tiffany’s photos,

236
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,702
social medias and otherwise.

237
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,451
She won’t let anyone shoot,
except for me,

238
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:25,334
so I thought I’d take photos
for the reunion as well.

239
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,203
Great.

240
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,788
I guess you’re hired then.

241
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,706
I also loved
your photo booth idea, too.

242
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,884
‐I thought it would be fun.
‐Oh, thank you.

243
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,383
I’m glad you liked it.

244
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,924
Tiffany and I also thought
maybe you could use

245
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,758
my assistance, you know,
with a little bit help.

246
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,764
She’s so busy with the album
release these days and, you know

247
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:48,477
especially since our moms
combined can be a bit of a lot.

248
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,811
I also have an amazing eye
for visuals, so I don’t mind

249
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:55,148
giving you any direction
there, too, if needed.

250
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,995
‐Direction, hm?
‐Yeah.

251
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:01,989
Well, we were just checking out
this holiday window display,

252
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:05,243
so I assume
you must have great taste.

253
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,116
And with that in mind,
I would love to show you

254
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:10,043
some venue possibilities
I came up with.

255
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,004
‐Uh...
‐What?

256
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,833
Did you guys
already pick a place, too?

257
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,500
Actually, my mother
and my Aunt Mona

258
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,758
both wanna have it
at each of their places.

259
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,549
My mother feels
it needs to be at her place,

260
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:22,684
but Aunt Mona thinks
it’s not as homey or cozy enough

261
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,682
and wants it at her place.

262
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,972
Between you and me, I don’t
think either can compromise.

263
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,227
Okay, well, have you hosted it

264
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,770
at either of their places
before?

265
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:33,692
No, we always had it
at Grandma Gladys’ place.

266
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,941
But now since she’s gone,
Aunt Alma lives there,

267
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:39,495
and it doesn’t seem like
much of an option now.

268
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:43,609
And also because Aunt Alma’s
not the one to fight for it.

269
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:47,028
So what is the solution then?

270
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:49,658
Tiffany and I was thinking
maybe we could host, say,

271
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,866
a pre‐union gathering
at our place this weekend.

272
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,837
You can come and meet everyone
as a pro,

273
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,548
and then if they agreed, and
leave it up to you to decide.

274
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:01,969
Okay. I suppose
I could do that.

275
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:06,010
Plus, I wanted to talk to you
more about your ideas.

276
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,715
I loved everything
Tiffany showed me,

277
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,387
but I thought it would be cute,
you know,

278
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:13,354
you can incorporate
some family traditions into it.

279
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:16,606
Family traditions. Okay. Got it.

280
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:19,571
That is, of course, provided
if you’re okay with that

281
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,730
and up for a challenge.

282
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,450
Always.

283
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:24,821
‐Always?
‐Mm‐hmm.

284
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:26,366
Well, I really hope
you mean that

285
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:27,409
because this reunion,

286
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,202
it’s not gonna be no easy task.

287
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,865
Well, I’m not worried because

288
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:34,253
I am going to make it perfect.

289
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,754
‐Perfect?
‐Mm‐hmm.

290
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:44,012
This is gonna be
a total disaster.

291
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:46,552
Oh, come on,
it can’t be that bad.

292
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:51,096
If I have to deal with him
the whole time, it will be.

293
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:54,024
And they even live together, so
if I wanna meet up with Tiffany,

294
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,942
he’s probably
gonna be there, too.

295
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,360
We’ve had worse clients,
come on.

296
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,439
Remember Bob the banker
who watched

297
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:02,365
every penny of our budget?

298
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,363
We had to have
every line item approved,

299
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,905
he even counted
the white tealights

300
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,698
to make sure we didn’t take any.

301
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:10,122
But this guy was just smug.

302
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:14,463
Does the hot gene
run in the family?

303
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:15,959
What does that mean?

304
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:19,462
I mean, is he as hot
as Tiffany is?

305
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,549
‐
‐Mm‐hmm!

306
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,881
So he is hot. I knew it.

307
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:29,088
Kayleigh, pass me the dumplings.

308
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,929
Anyway,
we have bigger fish to fry.

309
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,136
Tiffany says her family’s
filled with matriarchs

310
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,979
and each one of them
wanna have it their way.

311
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:42,485
So we figure out
which one signs the check.

312
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,608
‐That’s who we listen to.
‐Nope.

313
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:46,954
Because I think Tiffany
is paying for the entire thing,

314
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:50,159
so we have to figure out
who’s really in charge

315
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,621
now that they’re all competing.

316
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:54,661
And that’s who we really
have to win over.

317
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,117
Finally taking charge
of her life.

318
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,576
You know what, Amy Kessler,
that last dumpling in there,

319
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,298
it’s all yours.
You are officially my hero.

320
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,799
Don’t mind if I do.

321
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,933
‐Those look so good. Oh!
‐They do.

322
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:17,637
Mommy, come here,
I wanna introduce you

323
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:20,017
to our Christmas
family reunion planners.

324
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,524
‐Oh? Cool.
‐

325
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,816
‐This is Amy.
‐Hey.

326
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,610
And her assistant Kayleigh.

327
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,653
‐Ladies, this is my mother Mona.
‐Hello.

328
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,487
Mona, it is so nice to meet you.

329
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,702
Oh. Gosh, I love your dress.

330
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,874
‐Oh, this? Hey!
‐Oh, oh, oh, oh!

331
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,662
No, Tiffany bought it for me,
she spent way too much money

332
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:40,957
on it. But, uh,
I do look good in it, don’t I?

333
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:43,132
You certainly do.
Love the style.

334
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:45,381
Oh, thank you!
Well, look at you two ladies.

335
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,465
You know, initially
I thought you guys were

336
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,008
some of Tiffany’s model friends.

337
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,681
‐Oh.
‐Got it going on.

338
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,640
Thank you, but we are only here
to make sure

339
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,390
that you have
the best holiday reunion ever.

340
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:57,063
Oh? Well, thank you.

341
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,981
And I accept all of that
because,

342
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,060
guess what, the reunion’s
gonna be at my house. Right?

343
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,597
‐You told them that, right?
‐Mom.

344
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,270
‐What?
‐That hasn’t been decided.

345
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,648
And we still have
a lot to discuss.

346
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,034
Well, we have a lot
to discuss about

347
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:12,411
how it’s going to be
at our house. Right, baby?

348
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,240
Um, and, ladies,
this is my dad Terrence.

349
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:18,116
Terrence,
these are our party planners.

350
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:19,866
‐Hey.
‐Nice to meet you, ladies.

351
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:22,246
I tell you,
this food is something else.

352
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,173
You know, it’s like
Tiffany gave you a‐a‐a list

353
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:25,922
of my favorite finger foods.

354
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,633
Actually, Mr. Christmas,
she did.

355
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,046
Did you try the little
fig‐glazed chicken fritters?

356
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,843
Say what?

357
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:37,257
Uh... Why’d you do that?

358
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,890
Now these need to be
entree sized!

359
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:42,096
Oh, gosh. Right.
No, they don’t.

360
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,018
We’ll be right back.
Okay, Terrence, take it easy.

361
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:45,905
Take it... You gotta take it...

362
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,615
‐Right.
‐You know, of course, darling.

363
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:55,157
Oh, Aunt Eve is here.
Come on, I want you to meet her.

364
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:57,533
Hey, uh, can you head out
and grab the swag bags?

365
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,038
‐Are you sure you’re good?
‐Yeah. I’ll take it from here.

366
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:01,581
‐Okay. Thanks.
‐Okay.

367
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:07,838
‐Tiffany! Hi, baby girl! Mwah!
‐Hi, Aunt Eve! Hey!

368
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:10,762
Aunt Eve, I want you to meet
Amy, our reunion planner.

369
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,180
‐Amy, this is my Aunt Eve.
‐You must be Calvin’s mom.

370
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:16,012
I can certainly see
the resemblance.

371
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:19,307
Well, of course.
Amy, nice to meet you.

372
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:22,392
And what a lovely idea
this little pre‐reunion dinner

373
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,186
you’ve put together.

374
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:26,272
Calvin says you’re very good.

375
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,935
Don’t know if I said that
just yet.

376
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:30,284
But you did good, Amy.
Real good.

377
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,449
Well, it was a ton of fun
and a tiny taste

378
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,319
of what’s to come, I suppose?

379
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,198
‐We shall see.
‐Mm...

380
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:39,995
We generally tend to go
a bit more traditional

381
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,619
with the holiday decor,
but this is cute.

382
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:45,375
Thank you, uh, we just
wanted to do something fresher

383
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,999
for Tiffany’s casita look.

384
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,206
You know, the space,
it’s, it’s very modern space.

385
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:52,547
Yeah. Yes.
As is, as is my home.

386
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:55,093
And yet I’ve still managed
to instill a homey

387
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:58,296
and warm feeling, anyway. Well,
you’ll have to come see it.

388
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,757
I mean, after all,
we’re hoping to host the reunion

389
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,468
there this year, right, son?

390
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,388
I’m sorry, that’s
what you are hoping to do,

391
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,149
not what we are hoping to do.

392
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,899
Amy, please forgive
my poor sister‐in‐law.

393
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:12,114
You know, she really thinks
she’s the boss of this family

394
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:14,743
ever since Terrence lost
his poor dear mother, okay?

395
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,992
‐The boss, really?
‐Yes, the takeover spirit.

396
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:19,583
No, more like
the well‐organized one

397
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,290
who keeps
the whole family together.

398
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:23,079
Mother...
Takeover spirit. I mean‐‐

399
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:25,414
Please!
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

400
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,999
‐What?
‐You guys, please!

401
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:31,594
I barely just hired her.
Please don’t scare her away.

402
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:34,552
We still have three weeks
until the reunion.

403
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:36,222
Tiffany, I am your mother

404
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,392
and you will never silence me
like that in public.

405
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,509
‐What is wrong‐‐
‐Can I?

406
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,096
‐Baby, please.
‐Wow.

407
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:44,854
So everyone just wants
to team up on me today.

408
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:47,564
Oh, uh, mama, mom,
I‐I think Aunt Alma’s here.

409
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:50,815
Will you please go help her
on the stairs?

410
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,148
‐
‐I love you.

411
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,693
Look forward to seeing
all the things

412
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,186
you’re gonna do, okay?

413
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,147
‐I can’t wait to show you.
‐All right.

414
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:59,358
Always the extra parts.

415
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:04,412
My sister‐in‐law just showed up
with my baby nephew. Uh...

416
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,045
‐I‐is everything okay?
‐Hey, hey.

417
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,662
Don’t worry about it.
Everything’s under control.

418
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:10,208
‐Okay. Thank you.
‐Okay. Go.

419
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,502
Calvin, would you go and get me
a Shirley Temple

420
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,126
with extra cherries?

421
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:17,135
‐Sure. Uh‐huh.
‐Thank you.

422
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:20,548
‐So, Amy, is it?
‐Yes, ma’am.

423
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:24,766
When you have a moment, I would
love to sit and talk with you

424
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:26,519
about our family reunion.

425
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,190
I think once you see my place,

426
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,360
you will agree that it is
the perfect spot for the event.

427
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,610
Okay. And when would you like
to talk about it?

428
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:37,652
‐How about right now?
‐Right.

429
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,568
Uh, well, I guess you wanna know
what kind of ideas I cooked up.

430
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,116
Yes, absolutely, I mean,

431
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,621
we could always use
some improvement, right?

432
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,622
Look at you, my little man.

433
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,496
You’ve grown nearly an inch
since I last saw you.

434
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,503
No, that isn’t true.

435
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,915
Letty just hasn’t cut his hair
all year.

436
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:57,013
‐Now, mom, be sweet.
‐What? I am sweet.

437
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:58,721
‐Thank you.
‐

438
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,589
I suppose I should go say hello.

439
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,757
‐Hello, my dear!
‐Hi!

440
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:07,887
Uncle Leon and Aunt Alma.

441
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,685
Sit. Aunt Alma is
Grandma Gladys’ younger sister.

442
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,811
Ah, yes.
And their last name is Turner?

443
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,398
Oh, I see
someone’s been boning up

444
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:15,732
on the Christmas family
guest list.

445
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,186
Oh, I am very good at names.

446
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,899
Uh, well,
if you’re good with names

447
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,737
as you are standing your ground,

448
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,662
my mother really wants to have
the reunion at her place.

449
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,914
And if you let her boss you,
Amy, she will.

450
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,405
Oh, looks like
the apple didn’t fall far

451
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:31,707
from the caramel‐candy tree.

452
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,082
What is that supposed to mean?

453
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:34,917
So your mom is passionate

454
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:38,132
about a family reunion venue.

455
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,844
It’s a little more relevant
than being, uh, territorial

456
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:44,216
over a cafe table
I won’t mention.

457
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:47,265
But, hey, we came
to a common ground, didn’t we?

458
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:49,098
Yeah, because we were forced to.

459
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:52,233
Good evening,
good evening, everyone!

460
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:55,403
I just wanted to thank everyone
for being here tonight

461
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:58,323
and also thank everyone
who downloaded my album.

462
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,940
‐

463
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,568
Now then, we are so very excited

464
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:06,577
about our big upcoming family
reunion, and we just wanted

465
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,040
to invite a few of you locals
out here tonight

466
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,159
to look over my most up‐to‐date
email tree and make sure

467
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:15,458
that we have everyone’s
correct information, okay?

468
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:19,503
Um, we also are going to discuss
venue options.

469
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:22,838
So tonight here with us
we have Ms. Amy Kessler,

470
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:25,765
who we have hired
to help us with the event.

471
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:29,256
So any questions, concerns,
requests, food allergies,

472
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,890
anything like that, all goes to
her, and she is ready for you.

473
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:36,307
Yes. Well, thank you so much
for having me.

474
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:39,397
I cannot wait to meet
your big, beautiful family.

475
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,863
If you guys have any questions,
I’m so happy to help

476
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:44,454
with flights, accommodations,
anything that you guys need.

477
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:46,822
Mm. Thank you.
Okay, now...

478
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,117
So we’re gonna bring out
some more hors d’oeuvres.

479
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:51,293
Everyone go freshen up
on your cocktails

480
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:55,042
and don’t forget to save
the date for December 23rd

481
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:57,544
for our ten‐year
Christmas family reunion!

482
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:02,094
‐Christmas family tradition!
‐Christmas!

483
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:06,302
Aah! Here we go. Whoo‐hoo!

484
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,547
Uh, there, you know, okay?

485
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,847
You know the doctor said
you can’t have that, baby.

486
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,141
‐And, mom?
‐What?

487
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:13,516
You know how you get after two.

488
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:15,311
‐Ah, Tiffany.
‐I’m just sayin’.

489
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:16,686
‐Tiffany.
‐Yes?

490
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,440
Would you believe,
on our way over here

491
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:21,614
your Uncle Leon
saw a girl on a billboard

492
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,654
and she looked
exactly like you!

493
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:26,027
I tell you,
it was a spitting image.

494
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,783
It was really something else,
Tiffy.

495
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:31,835
Aunt Alma, Uncle Leon,
that was me.

496
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:34,542
Well, heavens! Are you serious?

497
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,872
What the heck you doin’ up
on that billboard, sweetheart?

498
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:39,787
Mm, oh, I think I know
what I’m getting you guys

499
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:41,167
for Christmas now.

500
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:43,515
‐

501
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:45,261
‐Can’t believe it.
‐That was me.

502
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:46,801
Can’t believe it.

503
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:53,353
So, Letty,
when are you expecting Eli

504
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:54,644
back from the service?

505
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:56,235
Hopefully before Christmas.

506
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:59,020
Uh, we’re cutting it
kinda close, right?

507
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,766
He was already
supposed to be back.

508
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,066
‐Mm.
‐Uh, Jonah.

509
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,530
What did I say earlier?

510
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:06,532
But, mom,
I only hate half the apple.

511
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:08,954
No, you ate off all the caramel
and half the apple.

512
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:10,781
‐Okay.
‐But I’m still hungry.

513
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:14,116
So eat something else.
Grab a chicken fritter, hm?

514
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:17,213
Seriously, though, there is
so much caramel on those apples,

515
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:20,881
you could feed a whole army
of Santa’s elves with ’em.

516
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,921
Grandma Gladys’ apples
were so good.

517
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,923
I miss her so much,
I don’t know why Aunt Alma

518
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,715
won’t just follow that recipe.

519
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,050
Jonah, what did I say?

520
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:31,681
Oh.

521
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,598
Remember those days.

522
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:44,942
Okay, so if I put
a snowflake projector

523
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:47,315
in front of the stage,
with the tree,

524
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:48,993
will that be a problem
for your lighting?

525
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:50,781
No. Not at all.

526
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,244
‐Tiff.
‐Hm?

527
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:56,996
Um, had Calvin met Amy
before this evening?

528
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:59,499
Oh, yeah, you know,
Calvin’s been really helpful

529
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,371
with all the planning.

530
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,748
‐Is that right?
‐Mm‐hmm.

531
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,667
Mm...

532
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,344
It actually looks great.

533
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:09,303
It could even be a Rocky
Mountain snowcapped mountain

534
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:10,973
like where Grandma Gladys
grew up.

535
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,931
That is a fantastic idea.

536
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:16,313
Look at us, finally agreeing on
something for once, Amy Kessler.

537
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,560
At first I was getting
a little bit more concerned.

538
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:20,484
Well, the only thing
you should be concerned about

539
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:22,901
is how to admit what
a fantastic job I do in the end.

540
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,150
Well, if it’s anything like
what you did tonight,

541
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,072
I may stand corrected,
but I still think

542
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,862
you have your work
cut out for you, Amy.

543
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:31,034
‐...about you and your home.
‐Well, it’s not all about me.

544
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:32,823
‐Let’s talk to Amy. Amy!
‐Amy!

545
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,986
‐Incoming.
‐Hi, honey.

546
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,985
‐Hi, dear.
‐We’ve come to a bit of a truce.

547
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,117
‐Just a bit of one.
‐Okay, of course.

548
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,956
And, um, how is Monday,
this Monday,

549
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,962
to come by my home,
see where Calvin grew up?

550
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,585
I have a lovely koi pond

551
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,712
and a fantastic garden
you just can’t miss.

552
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,217
I can definitely be there.

553
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:51,549
‐For sure. Yeah.
‐Great.

554
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,553
Okay, well,
how is Thursday for you

555
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:56,345
to come by my house
and see where Tiffany grew up?

556
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,930
I mean,
our home is just as good.

557
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:00,477
We don’t have a koi pond.
Fish smell fishy.

558
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:02,851
All right, but we do have
a baby grand piano

559
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,516
that is just itching
to be played.

560
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:07,115
‐I can be there, too.
‐Oh! Fantastic!

561
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:09,781
Well, those days don’t work
for me because I have

562
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:12,952
a signing on Monday
and a morning show on Thursday.

563
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,700
Why did you even say Thursday
anyways, mom?

564
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:16,742
Because I need time
to get the house ready.

565
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,865
Okay, look, you can’t just
reschedule it, honey?

566
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,502
Oh, yes, that’s right,
that’s what she’s gonna do.

567
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:22,581
She’s gonna reschedule
her whole PR tour for you.

568
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,624
Yes, it’s called
production,

569
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:25,918
and that’s what they do.
They make adjustments.

570
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,671
Not for the mother
of the artist.

571
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:30,265
Honey, the stage mother they do.

572
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:32,839
No, mom,
I, I really can’t do that.

573
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:36,676
Ladies, it’s okay,
I can bring Amy out. I’m free.

574
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:38,564
I just have a few, you know,
couple greeting‐card shoots,

575
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:40,059
but no one’s asking
for any headshots

576
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,230
in this point in the year,
so I can bring Amy.

577
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,309
Perfect. That works out perfect.

578
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:46,484
‐Very convenient. Thank you.
‐Yup.

579
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:47,935
‐No problem.
‐Good. Good, Good.

580
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,443
Okay, and then
that way we can all decide

581
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:53,236
whose home
we will have the reunion at.

582
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,530
Uh, actually, Amy will decide

583
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:58,487
where we’re having
the reunion, right?

584
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:01,785
Because that’s what
we all agreed on, right?

585
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,910
Did everyone get a chance
to try my candy apples?

586
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,708
‐Yes.
‐Yes, we did.

587
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:08,344
I almost went
to a diabetic coma,

588
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,840
but they were delicious,
they were delicious.

589
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,923
They are delicious,
aren’t they?

590
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:16,466
So now, Amy, is it?
Was that right?

591
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,722
Yes, ma’am.
It is so nice to meet you.

592
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:20,966
Oh, it’s nice to meet you, dear.

593
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,976
So if we are going to talk
about having the reunion

594
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,059
at my place on the 23rd,

595
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,646
we’ve got a lot
to talk about, right?

596
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,399
Yes, Christmas
is just around the corner,

597
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:33,363
so we have to make
some big decisions very soon.

598
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:37,445
When did Aunt Alma’s house get
in the running? Wait a minute.

599
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:57,341
‐

600
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:58,796
Is this where you grew up?

601
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:00,176
A Ventura County kinda Christmas

602
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:01,722
since I was a little kid.

603
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:05,183
Are you an only child?

604
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,557
‐My mom said I was a surprise.
‐Oh.

605
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,364
Dad said,
only a surprise to her.

606
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:12,359
But that even in her heart
she knew I was meant

607
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:13,821
to come and rescue her.

608
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:15,191
Rescue her from what?

609
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:16,987
Well, my dad passed away
ten years ago

610
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,200
right after
I graduated from college,

611
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:22,161
not too long after our last
Christmas reunion, actually.

612
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,582
‐Hm.
‐Oh, Calvin.

613
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,700
I’m sorry to hear it.

614
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:28,707
It’s fine.
Stan died a happy, happy man.

615
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:32,500
And we all got to say goodbye.
It was bittersweet.

616
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:36,666
But he’s still here, you know?
Still feel him every day.

617
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:40,552
Well, um, you ready to meet mom?

618
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:42,676
‐Yeah.
‐All right.

619
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:53,978
Wow! This arrangement and that
garland are all very impressive.

620
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:56,687
Yeah, my mom loves to redo
the holiday decor

621
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:58,067
every couple of years.

622
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,913
She has a strong opinion
about decor.

623
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:04,779
A person with strong opinions
does a strong leader make.

624
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,040
Amy, hi again.

625
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,910
Hi, Mrs. Christmas.

626
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:13,037
‐Please call me Eve.
‐Eve Christmas.

627
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,126
Yes, but please don’t
write it down.

628
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:17,302
It seems to always come out
backwards.

629
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:18,971
‐
‐Hey, mom.

630
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:20,629
Hi, darling.

631
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:23,297
‐Good to see you.
‐Good to see you.

632
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:27,307
Wow! Eve, I just love
these poinsettia arrangements.

633
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,232
They look like
they just walked off

634
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,639
of some Rodeo Drive
window display.

635
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,648
You have to tell me
who the designer is.

636
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,980
You’re looking at her.

637
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:38,608
‐You are?
‐I am.

638
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:40,994
I was just launching
into interior design

639
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:43,623
when my sweet little Calvin
came along.

640
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:46,329
I ruined her dreams of becoming
the first black Martha Stewart.

641
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,121
Oh, shush! Don’t say that.

642
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:52,254
You were my angel,
my miracle baby come true.

643
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,462
And I wouldn’t have it
any other way.

644
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:56,543
You just had
really bad timing is all.

645
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,170
Now, that man couldn’t get
anywhere on time

646
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:00,087
even if he tried.

647
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,673
But it just so happens

648
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:04,798
that you two have come along
at the perfect time.

649
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,306
‐Oh.
‐Uh‐oh. I know what that means.

650
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:11,099
‐She’s putting us to work.
‐That’s right. Follow me.

651
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:12,812
Great.

652
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:22,649
So what is all this?

653
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:24,318
Told you
she’s putting us to work.

654
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:28,276
These are Santa’s Stockings
From Stan.

655
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,948
Now say that three times fast
and let’s get to stuffing.

656
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:34,208
Wait. Did you say
Santa’s Stockings From Stan?

657
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,001
Isn’t that your father’s name?

658
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:39,504
It’s an old Christmas family
tradition my husband started

659
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:41,298
when he was a little boy.

660
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:44,431
When he found out that there
were kids who didn’t get toys

661
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:49,471
or gifts for Christmas, he asked
his mama Gladys and his papa Joe

662
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,516
to give his toys
to the kids in need.

663
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,310
So after he passed,
Calvin and I decided

664
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:58,435
to continue that tradition
in his name.

665
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:01,645
The whole Christmas family
participates.

666
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:05,415
‐So no family gifts at all?
‐No.

667
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:08,909
We haven’t exchanged gifts
in the past ten years.

668
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:12,334
My goodness.
That is so incredible.

669
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,372
I think I know exactly
what I’m gonna ask my parents

670
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:15,666
for next Christmas.

671
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:17,539
And where are your parents, Amy?

672
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:19,916
Oh, they’re here.
Up in Santa Barbara.

673
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:23,013
Oh. Fancy living, huh?

674
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,590
Yeah, you know,
they, they still do nice things

675
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:28,005
like donate money to charities.

676
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:31,395
But this,

677
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:34,523
this just feels...

678
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:38,861
warmer, more personal.
I love it.

679
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:41,359
Hm. And I see
you’re not married.

680
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,111
‐Huh?
‐Mother.

681
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:45,783
What? It’s just
a friendly conversation.

682
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:50,072
It’s fine. Um, I was
in a serious relationship.

683
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:53,448
And I thought
we were gonna get married,

684
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,368
but, no.

685
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,865
I am still single.

686
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:59,287
Hm...

687
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:01,126
So what’s next?

688
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:03,633
‐Get to stuffin’.
‐Okay.

689
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,586
Okay.

690
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:10,889
We stuffed
three dozen of stockings.

691
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:12,681
I’d say we cleaned up.

692
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:15,216
‐Well done!
‐What now?

693
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:18,648
Now we take these down
to First Presbyterian Church.

694
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:21,648
They have a distribution list
of all the families in need.

695
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,651
Then we surprise the families by
leaving them on their doorstep

696
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,994
on Christmas Eve.

697
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:29,742
‐Aww! I love it.
‐

698
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:31,743
Oh, can we go see the koi pond?

699
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:41,331
‐Wow. They’re so beautiful!
‐That they are.

700
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:43,248
You know,
you look a lot like your dad.

701
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:47,506
‐Thank you.
‐You guys have the same smile.

702
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,012
He was a good‐looking dude.

703
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,929
Come on,
let me show you the rest.

704
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:54,353
Okay.

705
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:05,322
Oh! These lampposts
are incredible.

706
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,320
Yeah. My dad put these put up
when I was small.

707
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,613
He and my mom knew
I was notorious for sneaking

708
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:13,117
out the house,
especially around the holidays.

709
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,990
Why especially
the holidays?

710
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,247
Well, I thought Santa and I
had a special deal

711
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:21,711
where I used to bring cookies
out to my favorite play spot.

712
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,843
And I was sure if I came out at
night, I’d eventually see him.

713
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,500
Hm.

714
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:29,668
Of course, I thought
Santa was eating the cookies.

715
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:33,968
Now I’m pretty sure it was just
a squirrel or the birds.

716
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:38,642
Aww...

717
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:42,515
A pinecone tree! How adorable!

718
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:46,074
Yeah, my mom
always loved pinecones,

719
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,609
so we all built this together
one year for Santa.

720
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,485
We used to put the cookies
right on this small stump

721
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,490
sitting next to the tree.
Memories.

722
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,873
‐Think I could get a photo?
‐Sure.

723
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:57,871
You know,
I think I have some already

724
00:33:57,953 --> 00:33:59,413
in my phone where I can send.

725
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,078
‐Great. Thanks.
‐Yeah.

726
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,140
‐You wanna know what I think?
‐What’s that?

727
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:19,934
How do you know it wasn’t really
Santa who was eating the cookies

728
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,226
you left out?

729
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,770
With these lampposts to guide
him, would’ve been pretty easy

730
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,016
for him to find it
on his sleigh, don’t you think?

731
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:29,397
‐Yeah.
‐

732
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:41,203
So what do you think
of our place?

733
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:43,708
Perfect spot
for the reunion, yes?

734
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,460
I think it’s definitely
a strong contender.

735
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:47,793
‐You sold it very well.
‐Well...

736
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,629
Obviously, not well enough

737
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,804
if you haven’t
made a decision yet.

738
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:54,631
Well, it’s just that
I promised everyone

739
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:57,598
that I would check out
all the places first, so...

740
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:58,889
My mom is just teasing you.

741
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:00,602
She knows we have to be fair

742
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:02,102
about this, right?

743
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,813
Yes. Of course I do.

744
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,556
But because
Amy clearly has good taste,

745
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:10,727
I’m convinced
that you’ll decide what’s fair

746
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,897
is having it right here.

747
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:19,081
Is she gonna hate me
if we decide

748
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:20,409
to have it somewhere else?

749
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,583
Nah, she might pretend
you don’t exist

750
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:26,002
when she sees you next, but
definitely wouldn’t hate you.

751
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:29,094
‐Uh...
‐I’m teasing you.

752
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:30,709
‐Totally teasing.
‐Thanks.

753
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:06,956
Aah! There he is!
There’s my favorite nephew!

754
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,000
I thought
Bryson was your favorite.

755
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:12,004
Oh, Bryson is my favorite
during soccer season

756
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:13,167
and when he’s playing.

757
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,974
‐Hey! Hi, baby.
‐Hi.

758
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:17,759
Mona, it’s so good
to see you again.

759
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,474
It’s so good to see you.
And you know what?

760
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:22,472
I’m excited you’re here
because you’re just in time

761
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:25,555
to help me put up the
Christmas lights on the porch.

762
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:27,522
‐Hey, you ready to get to work?
‐Uh‐huh.

763
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,402
Ah, it’s a Christmas
family tradition, I guess.

764
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,110
You visit family,
they put you to work.

765
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:34,152
‐
‐No complaints from me.

766
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:35,824
Oh, exactly,
because who doesn’t like

767
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,072
putting up Christmas lights?

768
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,703
Especially on a porch like this.

769
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,990
Mona, this house is spectacular.

770
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:44,334
Oh! Well, I am so glad
you approve, darling.

771
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:46,951
Come on in, I’m gonna
give you the full tour.

772
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,210
‐Okay.
‐Oh.

773
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:51,079
‐

774
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:54,549
Ah.

775
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,799
This is so precious.

776
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:59,093
Oh, Tiff and I,
we started that collection

777
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,505
when she was just a kid.

778
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,553
No wonder
Tiffany loves Christmas so much.

779
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,257
It really shows
in her new holiday album.

780
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:05,599
‐I know, right?
‐Mm‐hmm.

781
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:07,522
‐My baby is so talented!
‐

782
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,020
‐Come on! This way.
‐Okay.

783
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,068
This stuff is vintage,
isn’t it?

784
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:19,531
Yes! I am
a vintage Christmas connoisseur.

785
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,782
Well, it definitely shows.

786
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,526
Hey, can we get some photos
of all of us?

787
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,446
‐Oh. No problem, I got you.
‐Great.

788
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:27,415
Oh, Calvin,
make sure you get your auntie.

789
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:28,695
‐Yes, auntie.
‐Okay.

790
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,788
And look at baby Jesus.
Isn’t he cute?

791
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:33,214
‐He’s so cute.
‐Uh‐uh. Don’t touch it.

792
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:35,383
‐Oh, sorry. Okay.
‐Don’t touch it. All right.

793
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,300
A little higher
to the right here, baby.

794
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,093
Oh. Amy.

795
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:45,467
So, I take it you went out
to see Eve’s place on Monday?

796
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:47,725
Yes. And her place
is beautiful, too.

797
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,597
Oh, for sure, but, you know,

798
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,984
we both have very different
decorating styles,

799
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:55,653
even though I do appreciate
her decorating expertise.

800
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:59,072
Absolutely, but you both have
excellent decorating skills.

801
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:02,152
Ooh, so I guess it’s safe to say

802
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,408
that I am still in the running?

803
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:07,161
‐Oh, Mona.
‐What?

804
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,945
Doesn’t matter
where we have this reunion.

805
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:12,748
You’ll still have all eyes
on you. You always do.

806
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:15,582
Aww. You hear that, Calvin?

807
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:18,748
See, that is how you get
the girl of your dreams.

808
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:22,508
He still knows how to woo me
after 32 years.

809
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:44,203
‐What’s next?
‐You’ll see.

810
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,322
Hm.

811
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:47,659
Wow.

812
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,790
This must be Tiffany’s old room.

813
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,290
Yeah, I used to get stuck
sleeping there

814
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:53,912
right on the floor as a kid

815
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,130
when mom and dad brought us
for a visit.

816
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:59,999
Aww, little Calvin
on a sleeping bag

817
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:03,218
in a sea of pink.
I could see it now.

818
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,049
Oh. You got jokes now?

819
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,894
‐Mm‐hmm. Mm.
‐Mm.

820
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,680
Come on, let’s go.

821
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:17,398
‐We finally arrived.
‐Uh‐huh.

822
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:26,069
Wow, do you think your
Aunt Mona would let us borrow

823
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,567
some of this stuff
for the reunion?

824
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:29,369
Oh, yeah,
it’s not a problem at all.

825
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,370
‐Except cool Santa here.
‐Oh.

826
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:34,082
He stays and protects all her
stuff. Get a photo with him.

827
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,205
It’s the least
we can ask of him, anyway.

828
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:42,252
‐Chic.
‐Chic. Okay.

829
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,668
Well, these are chic. Come here.

830
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:46,176
‐Let me put them on you.
‐All right.

831
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:48,429
‐It’s somethin’ else.
‐It looks adorable.

832
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,603
‐Hm, let’s go.
‐Okay.

833
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,270
‐One, two, three. Say "Money!"
‐All right, Santa.

834
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,561
Money!

835
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,772
All right. Light it up.

836
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:59,115
Light it up, baby!

837
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,610
Ah, ah!

838
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,530
Never ceases to amaze me.

839
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:05,689
No, you never cease to amaze me,
Mr. Christmas.

840
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,448
‐
‐Ooh.

841
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,490
Tiffany Anne,
what are you doing here?

842
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:13,117
I thought
you had the morning show!

843
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,122
‐What are you doing?
‐Hey, baby.

844
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,705
Mom, it was a morning show!

845
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:19,539
‐It’s night. I’m done.
‐Oh, I’m sorry.

846
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:21,246
Plus, I couldn’t miss
the beautiful

847
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:22,876
house‐lighting ceremony.

848
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:23,922
Aww!
Aww!

849
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,715
Tiffany,
I’m so glad you made it!

850
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,628
‐I’m so happy to see you.
‐

851
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:30,387
And, girl, I may have plugged
you on the morning show.

852
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,930
‐What?
‐Yes.

853
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:33,433
I mean, just how amazing you are

854
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,814
in getting
our family reunion set up.

855
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:39,102
‐Thank you. That is so sweet.
‐Of course.

856
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:41,267
My little girl
moving back home yet?

857
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:44,106
‐Mm‐hmm. You wish, daddy.
‐

858
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:47,152
‐Oh, this is so beautiful!
‐Isn’t it gorgeous?

859
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,738
It looks so good, as always.

860
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:52,122
I say we just have the reunion
here and call it a night.

861
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,620
‐Yeah, uh, okay!
‐Okay!

862
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:57,582
‐
‐Uh, you think about it.

863
00:40:57,664 --> 00:40:58,834
‐I’ll think about it.
‐

864
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:04,417
So, have you heard
anything more as to when,

865
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:06,214
you know, Eli will be home?

866
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:10,679
Letty said maybe Christmas,
but we just don’t know.

867
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,760
I mean, he’s still active duty
on the Air Force,

868
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:16,766
so I have no clue.

869
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,309
Hm, well, I sure hope
he makes it in time

870
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:20,774
for, you know,
little Jonah’s sake.

871
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,193
Tsk. Don’t we all?

872
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:25,441
This old piano is incredible.

873
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:27,655
Guess now I know where
your musical talents came from.

874
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,315
‐
‐All right.

875
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:32,164
All right! Get over here. Okay.

876
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,120
I think it’s time for a little
Christmas family tradition

877
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,661
because I don’t think
Ms. Amy is quite sold

878
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:39,745
on having the family reunion
here yet.

879
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:43,002
So you’re gonna get a treat
that you can only get

880
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:45,294
at Ms. Mona’s house.

881
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:47,878
Christmas carols and cocoa.

882
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:50,224
‐
‐Oh...

883
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,049
Go, Tiffany.
Show ’em what you got, babe.

884
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:54,015
‐Okay. All right.
‐Shall we?

885
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,515
‐Calvin.
‐We shall.

886
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:58,306
‐All right.
‐All right!

887
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:00,061
‐You’re gonna love this.
‐Okay.

888
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:05,312
Okay. I hear you, oh, baby.
I know, baby.

889
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:11,899

Every year you just get
better and better.

901
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:03,751
‐Better, baby!
‐Thank you.

902
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:07,631
‐Ooh, that’s my baby!
‐That’s a good man, over there.

903
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:10,380
Just like my brother Stan was.

904
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:17,052
Hey, this doesn’t
all look like the stuff

905
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:19,216
from your original sketches.

906
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:23,135
Well, I kinda decided to go
in a new direction, I think.

907
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:25,726
You? Go in a new direction?
Since when?

908
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:27,692
This isn’t rose gold
and champagne

909
00:43:27,814 --> 00:43:28,984
we’re talking about here.

910
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:31,325
Exactly, it’s a family reunion,

911
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,570
so we should treat it like one.

912
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:54,380
‐Oh. Thank you.
‐You’re welcome.

913
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:56,007
Right this way.

914
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:06,016
Oh, this is...

915
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:07,694
Like something
out of a fairytale.

916
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:11,650
An old romantic
Christmas fairytale.

917
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:14,322
Welcome to Casa de Christmas.

918
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:15,532
Ah.

919
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,027
Is this...

920
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:20,658
‐Is this handmade?
‐Yup.

921
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,411
‐By my great‐grandmother Ethel.
‐Ah!

922
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:24,705
This wreath
has magical Christmas powers.

923
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:27,409
‐I can just feel it.
‐Well, I sure hope so.

924
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,580
It’s a Christmas family
original.

925
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:30,959
Welcome.

926
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:39,131
Wow.

927
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:42,721
Indeed.

928
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:45,095
Lots of this stuff
has been passed down.

929
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:46,734
My guess is
my mom and Aunt Mona

930
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:49,059
are gonna have to fight
to see who gets it some day.

931
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,687
‐Hey, family.
‐Uncle Cal!

932
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:55,975
Hi.

933
00:44:57,111 --> 00:45:00,031
‐Hi.
‐Hey, buddy.

934
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:01,414
He likes to call me his uncle

935
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,452
even though
he’s technically my cousin.

936
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:06,576
You know me better than that.
I don’t live on technicalities.

937
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:09,374
‐Whatever that is.
‐

938
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:12,577
So you’re Calvin’s girlfriend,
yes?

939
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,628
Aunt Alma, no, she’s his friend

940
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:16,464
and our reunion planner,
remember?

941
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:18,089
Yeah, you met her
at me and Tiffany’s place

942
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:19,384
just a week or so ago.

943
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:22,337
‐Oh, right!
‐Mm.

944
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:25,678
‐Oh, I’m so sorry, hon.
‐It’s fine.

945
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:29,275
Well, maybe she should be your
girlfriend. She sure is pretty.

946
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:32,603
Ah, Jonah.
Excuse me, little man.

947
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,310
Can I get you guys
some pumpkin nog?

948
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,110
I made some fresh from
the pumpkin just this morning.

949
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:39,405
‐It’s really good.
‐Pumpkin! Yes, please.

950
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:41,157
Yeah.

951
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,780
Okay.

952
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:44,775
Look, Uncle Cal,
we’re making our yearly

953
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:47,199
annual gingerbread houses
for the dining‐room table.

954
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:49,036
You mean yearly or annual?

955
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:50,911
You know it means
the same thing, little bud.

956
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:54,208
‐I knew that. I was testing you.
‐Mm‐hmm.

957
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:57,054
What are you doing?

958
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:59,549
Well, I assume
we’re getting put to work, no?

959
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:02,432
Looks like another Christmas
family tradition to me.

960
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:06,140
Now, I like this one.
She’s got the right idea.

961
00:46:06,222 --> 00:46:09,432
Now you go over there
and wash your hands.

962
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:11,057
But, you know,
I’m really bad at making

963
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,773
gingerbread houses,
though, all right?

964
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:16,943
He’s not lying, last year
his gingerbread house caved in

965
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:18,444
and my dad had to come in
last second

966
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:20,356
for major
construction reinforcements.

967
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:22,946
That’s right, he had to make
little candy‐cane beams

968
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,620
to hold ’em together.

969
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:25,779
And those were Gladys’

970
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:27,786
famous homemade candy canes.

971
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:31,458
It was a waste of tasty
holiday treats, if you ask me.

972
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:32,959
Hm.
Yeah, I agree.

973
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,080
Which is why
I should just take photos

974
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:36,957
and be a nice spectator today.

975
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:39,174
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

976
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:43,135
If I’m building a house,
you’re building a house, too.

977
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,427
‐Oh, really?
‐Mm‐hmm.

978
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,090
Oops.

979
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:57,652
That looks so good. Hm.

980
00:46:57,732 --> 00:46:58,982
‐What do you think?
‐What?

981
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:02,066
Hm, this is really good.

982
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:03,364
You think so?

983
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:09,284
Oh, I was, uh, talking about
the eggnog.

984
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:12,908
But your house,
it’s, it’s not bad. Really.

985
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:14,959
I don’t know
if I’d call it good.

986
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:20,166
Okay, okay,
let’s call in Uncle Leon.

987
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:22,514
‐Yeah, maybe he can‐‐
‐Uncle Leon.

988
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,013
What’s all this yelling about?

989
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:27,973
We need you to judge our houses.

990
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:29,894
You’re the only one with a bias.

991
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:33,351
Without a bias.

992
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:36,484
Another test.
Good thing you passed.

993
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:38,562
Hm, all right, let me see, uh...

994
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:41,395
Mm‐hmm.

995
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:45,356
Mm‐hmm. Mm‐hmm.

996
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:47,492
Mm?

997
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:49,914
Mm! Mm...

998
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:54,957
‐Uh, you built this house?
‐Mm‐hmm, yup.

999
00:47:55,081 --> 00:47:57,251
Well, did a hurricane
come through there?

1000
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:00,838
Uh, the roof
looks all

1001
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:05,048
‐You know what? It’s fine.
‐What?

1002
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:07,382
‐Yeah, there you go.
‐Oops.

1003
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:08,928
Jonah’s house
is clearly the winner.

1004
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:10,263
‐Yay!
‐Yay!

1005
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:11,718
Now, uh, can I go back out

1006
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:13,016
and get my work done?

1007
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:14,729
I still gotta feed the chickens.

1008
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:18,269
‐The chickens?
‐Saving the best for last.

1009
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:43,050
Ah!

1010
00:48:48,801 --> 00:48:50,971
This is where the reunion was
ten years ago.

1011
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:52,893
Last time dad was here.

1012
00:48:52,972 --> 00:48:56,272
‐It’s perfect.
‐Great.

1013
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,890
Tiffany and I also agree.

1014
00:48:57,977 --> 00:49:00,477
Why didn’t you guys
say something?

1015
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:02,443
We needed
a professional opinion.

1016
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:06,317
‐
‐Really good.

1017
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:10,156
That was fun.

1018
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:12,659
All of our trips
have been a lot of fun.

1019
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:15,491
You know, I wish
my parents had a fraction

1020
00:49:15,578 --> 00:49:17,448
of the Christmas spirit
that yours does.

1021
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:20,998
Why? Your family doesn’t like
the holidays?

1022
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,593
No, they do, it’s just...

1023
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:28,219
My dad,
he loves food and sports.

1024
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,970
And my mom loves shopping

1025
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:33,301
and buying gifts
for extended family.

1026
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,427
And don’t get me wrong,
I love my family.

1027
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:38,354
It’s just,
I do spend my Christmases

1028
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:41,726
cooking with the maid
and watching Christmas movies.

1029
00:49:41,854 --> 00:49:43,484
Mm! Christmas movies, huh?

1030
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:47,404
What? I get a ton of inspiration
from them.

1031
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:50,356
No judgment here. I could dig
some Christmas movies.

1032
00:49:50,446 --> 00:49:51,946
But the viewings
are meant to be shared.

1033
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:53,701
Well, then maybe I’ll ask Santa

1034
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:55,662
and see if he can extend
his visit next time.

1035
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:59,043
Or if Santa is too busy,
which I know he will be,

1036
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:01,213
I could join you.

1037
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:05,960
Uh, I’ll ask Santa
and see what he says.

1038
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:09,015
I don’t loathe the idea.

1039
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:11,839
I just need a view
with the best seat, that’s all.

1040
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:12,836
Oh!

1041
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:18,637
‐To be discussed, seat‐stealer.
‐Mm.

1042
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:28,861
Um...

1043
00:50:28,943 --> 00:50:32,203
Okay. Um...

1044
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:34,869
I guess we should get going.

1045
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:36,699
Can you swing by Sunday at noon?

1046
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:38,414
Yeah, Sunday at noon, mm‐hmm.

1047
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:41,746
Yeah, um, I just have to
reconfigure a couple of things.

1048
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:44,580
Oh, no, no, no, this won’t be
about event stuff.

1049
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:47,588
This is so we can tell our moms
where we’re having the event.

1050
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:51,050
‐We?
‐Oh! We.

1051
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:59,847
Christmas, no pun intended,
just calm down.

1052
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:02,682
Everyone! All right. Everyone.

1053
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:06,098
After much deliberation we have
finally come to a decision

1054
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:08,690
on the reunion and where
we’ll have it this year.

1055
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:11,284
It was a hard decision for us
to make as a fellow family,

1056
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:15,280
and that is why we objectively
left it to Amy.

1057
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:18,696
Though we support
that decision.

1058
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:22,124
Now, then, uh, Amy,
you can tell them.

1059
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:25,997
Well, after much thought,

1060
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:29,175
I decided the theme
for this year’s family reunion

1061
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:31,765
is Christmas tradition.

1062
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:34,219
And not the holiday Christmas.

1063
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:37,590
What I mean
is the Christmas family

1064
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:38,848
and your traditions.

1065
00:51:38,971 --> 00:51:41,471
‐That’s cute.
‐Okay.

1066
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:44,979
But all of our houses have
Christmas family traditions.

1067
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,900
Right. And so many
wonderful ones, too.

1068
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:50,570
But with that in mind,
I think the best place

1069
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:54,279
for a reunion
filled with lots of traditions

1070
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,821
is where it all started.

1071
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:59,155
‐Alma and Leon’s place.
‐Yay!

1072
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:00,993
Ah. Whatever!

1073
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:03,616
Listen, I‐I can’t believe we
have left our family tradition

1074
00:52:03,704 --> 00:52:05,584
up to this little party‐planner.

1075
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:07,334
She doesn’t even have any skin
in the game.

1076
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:10,338
Exactly why we left it to her
at the end, mom.

1077
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:12,341
‐Amy knows what she’s doing.
‐Really?

1078
00:52:12,421 --> 00:52:13,421
‐I think we can trust her.
‐Yeah.

1079
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:15,795
‐Does she?
‐Mm!

1080
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:20,676
Or maybe Amy should take
another trip

1081
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:22,763
down to the ranch house.

1082
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:26,098
Amy, do you like
deep‐fried turkey?

1083
00:52:26,185 --> 00:52:27,695
’Cause, you know, Terrence,
he makes the best,

1084
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:30,401
and I’m sure that he would love
to make some for you.

1085
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:31,692
‐Mom.
‐I mean, what?

1086
00:52:31,774 --> 00:52:34,484
You cannot bribe her!

1087
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:37,738
You cannot bribe her,
you guys, we don’t have time

1088
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:39,413
to keep going back and forth
about this.

1089
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:41,951
We have two weeks left
for the reunion now.

1090
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:44,124
The flights have already
been booked and the invitations

1091
00:52:44,203 --> 00:52:46,293
have to go out by Monday,
all right?

1092
00:52:46,372 --> 00:52:48,462
Listen,
I knew that it was a mistake

1093
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,880
to leave this reunion
up to you kids.

1094
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:52,959
We are the parents,
and we still know what is best.

1095
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:55,055
‐For this family.
‐Speak for yourself, dear.

1096
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:57,222
If you know what’s best,
mom, maybe

1097
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:59,469
you and Aunt Mona might agree
on something for once.

1098
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:02,301
How dare you speak to me
in that tone, Calvin!

1099
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:05,518
Everyone, please,
may I just say...

1100
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,929
If you all trust me
and give me a chance

1101
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:11,400
to bring this reunion to life
the way I know I can,

1102
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,980
I promise,
I will not let you down.

1103
00:53:15,067 --> 00:53:18,107
You sure you don’t want
to come back to the ranch house?

1104
00:53:18,237 --> 00:53:19,397
‐Mom!
‐What?

1105
00:53:19,488 --> 00:53:21,488
I make a mean margarita, girl.

1106
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:23,533
You do. Aunt Alma.

1107
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:27,037
Aunt Alma, is there anything
else that you would like to add?

1108
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:28,581
‐A‐about what?
‐About us...

1109
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:31,036
Having the family reunion
at your place now.

1110
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:33,425
Well, wasn’t it always
gonna be here?

1111
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:36,302
‐Oh, my God!
‐Okay, you know what, see?

1112
00:53:36,422 --> 00:53:37,762
‐We made the right decision.
‐Absolutely.

1113
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:50,101
Amy, this is incredible. Really.

1114
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:53,095
‐Really? You like it?
‐It’s perfect.

1115
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,860
And the pinecone tree,
nice touch, Ms. Kessler.

1116
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:58,901
Oh, well, I just figured,
since you took my table,

1117
00:53:58,986 --> 00:54:00,776
you wouldn’t mind me
stealing your tree.

1118
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:04,284
All right, uh...

1119
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:06,908
What’s next on the agenda?

1120
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:09,624
I think it’s time to decorate.

1121
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:11,117

Okay, who’s ready to try

1145
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:10,243
my special take
on Gladys’ recipe?

1146
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:11,445
Oh, yes.

1147
00:56:11,577 --> 00:56:13,407
‐Thank you.
‐Thank you so much.

1148
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:16,365
Can’t wait to try
this new recipe.

1149
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:18,666
Yum.

1150
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,590
‐

1151
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:25,665
I think they’re a little strong.

1152
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:28,087
Only a, only a little.

1153
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:31,346
‐Like, just a little bit.
‐You know what?

1154
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:34,270
Some people love strong mint.

1155
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:38,191
O‐or, you know,
maybe just for the reunion,

1156
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:40,770
it would be nice if we stuck

1157
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:43,858
to Grandma Gladys’ recipe.

1158
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:45,942
‐To honor her.
‐Mm.

1159
00:56:46,028 --> 00:56:48,658
‐Grandma’s recipe. I like that.
‐Yeah.

1160
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:51,240
Okay, you might be right,
I think I’ll stick

1161
00:56:51,325 --> 00:56:53,625
to the original recipe.

1162
00:56:53,702 --> 00:56:55,202
Good idea.

1163
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:07,554
Ah. Ah.

1164
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:11,223
Go on, get out of here,
go on your bug swipe holidate.

1165
00:57:11,303 --> 00:57:13,563
‐You know, I think he’s the one.
‐Hm.

1166
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:15,639
You sure you don’t need
any more help?

1167
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:19,143
I think we’re okay.

1168
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:21,147
Mm! Mm‐hm.

1169
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:26,397
Hm. Shall we?

1170
00:57:26,485 --> 00:57:28,115
‐We shall.
‐Yeah.

1171
00:57:36,328 --> 00:57:37,288
Ah...

1172
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:43,329
So beautiful.

1173
00:57:48,048 --> 00:57:50,048
What’s on your jacket?

1174
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:53,675
Oh! Must’ve gotten some dirt
from the photo booth.

1175
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:56,854
Yeah. You mind
if you let me see?

1176
00:57:56,932 --> 00:57:58,272
‐Sure?
‐Yeah.

1177
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:00,194
Okay.

1178
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:09,028
‐Thank you.
‐There.

1179
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:11,362
She’s all better.

1180
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,950
Grandma Gladys,
she seems to be the glue

1181
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:17,834
that held the family together,
huh?

1182
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:20,291
Oh, yeah, she’s the woman
that could work and play

1183
00:58:20,372 --> 00:58:22,252
and check on everyone
all in the same day.

1184
00:58:22,374 --> 00:58:26,794
And your mom and Aunt Mona, they
seem to really look up to her.

1185
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:29,458
Yeah, I feel like both of them
marrying her two sons,

1186
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:31,008
they competed for her attention.

1187
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:33,381
And that’s where all this
venue drama stems from.

1188
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:37,560
Well, I can only imagine
how difficult it must be

1189
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:39,179
being someone’s daughter‐in‐law,
I mean,

1190
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:41,136
trying to do the same job
with your kids

1191
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:42,636
as they did with theirs.

1192
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:46,648
Right. My dad, he made my mother
much sweeter.

1193
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:49,069
Better.

1194
00:58:49,151 --> 00:58:51,991
He’s a lot like Grandma Gladys,
actually.

1195
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:53,990
I think you’re a lot like them,
too.

1196
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:57,742
Oh, yeah? Table‐taker,
you’re calling me sweet?

1197
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:03,576
Well, I didn’t wanna admit that.

1198
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:08,093
But it’s kinda hard not to.

1199
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:11,840
I mean, here you are,
helping me with my jacket.

1200
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:14,183
You’re not that bad yourself,
actually.

1201
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:16,259
A lot like my mom,
talk a big talk,

1202
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:18,216
but you’re sweet down beneath
all of this polishedness.

1203
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:20,435
‐Oh.
‐Uh‐huh.

1204
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:22,095
You really poured your heart out

1205
00:59:22,184 --> 00:59:23,854
into this
Christmas family reunion.

1206
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:27,515
Seems to me that the holiday
spirit is kinda your thing.

1207
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:29,226
Your boss must be grateful
to have you.

1208
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:31,436
My boss...

1209
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:34,566
Yeah, it’s,
it’s a little complicated.

1210
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:38,164
Look, I’ve been, I’ve been
meaning to tell you something.

1211
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:40,743
‐There you are.
‐Hi.

1212
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:43,037
What are you two doing
out here in the cold?

1213
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:45,211
Uh... Mom!

1214
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:47,630
‐What are you doin’ here?
‐I came to check on things.

1215
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:51,421
And see how the decorations
were going.

1216
00:59:51,505 --> 00:59:53,635
And actually Uncle Leon
is bringing in some groceries

1217
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:56,255
that I brought over and I’m sure
he could use your help, Calvin.

1218
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:58,933
Yeah, for sure. You good, Amy?

1219
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:00,472
Oh, yeah, I’m‐I’m great.

1220
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:02,677
Uh, thank you for helping me
with my jacket.

1221
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:05,638
No problem. I’ll see you
tomorrow to do the gift bags.

1222
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:07,477
Yup. Bright and early.

1223
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:10,324
‐Right. Goodnight.
‐Goodnight.

1224
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:13,068
‐I’ll see you inside, mom.
‐Sounds good.

1225
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:14,321
All right.

1226
01:00:19,074 --> 01:00:21,584
‐So...
‐So...

1227
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:25,580
‐It is a work in progress.
‐Clearly.

1228
01:00:25,664 --> 01:00:29,044
It seems like there’s a lot
still left to do in just a week.

1229
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:31,497
Right, and I do have
a couple of assistants

1230
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:33,376
coming in next week
to help with the stuff

1231
01:00:33,505 --> 01:00:35,885
that we don’t want weathered
right before the reunion.

1232
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:37,217
Mm.

1233
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:40,472
And, uh, the Santa set‐up?

1234
01:00:40,554 --> 01:00:42,474
I think you’re gonna love it.

1235
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:44,771
Well, I hope so.

1236
01:00:49,563 --> 01:00:52,863
‐So much good stuff.
‐Merry Christmas!

1237
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:55,193
‐Look at these swag bags!
‐Hey. Hey.

1238
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:58,068
Good morning, look at all
these brands I got to sponsor

1239
01:00:58,196 --> 01:00:59,656
our swag bags for free.

1240
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:02,329
‐Oh, Tiffany, that is amazing!
‐Yes.

1241
01:01:02,409 --> 01:01:04,539
Well, you guys, let’s get going.

1242
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:06,119
They’re not gonna
stuff themselves.

1243
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:08,504
‐Right.
‐Let’s get to stuffing them.

1244
01:01:10,292 --> 01:01:12,252
Oh, you guys, it’s my manager,
I gotta take this.

1245
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:15,837
‐One second. Hey, Ricky.
‐Oh. Okay.

1246
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:18,382
‐She’s not coming back, is she?
‐Definitely not.

1247
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:20,386
I guess it’s just us, huh?

1248
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:21,718
I guess so.

1249
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:26,724
Can you go first?
I’m scared to.

1250
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:28,478
‐Okay.
‐

1251
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:36,730
"You will find
the true path to love."

1252
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:38,818
‐Mm‐hmm.
‐I could get with that.

1253
01:01:38,904 --> 01:01:41,664
‐I think you have mine. Give me!
‐Absolutely not!

1254
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:44,830
‐
‐Here.

1255
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:47,370
‐This is yours.
‐All right, let’s see.

1256
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,210
"You will catch
a shooting star."

1257
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:56,424
Oh, maybe you did get mine.
Give, give.

1258
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:58,586
‐Nope.
‐Nope?

1259
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:03,587
‐Okay.
‐I did get you something though.

1260
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,260
‐You did?
‐Follow me.

1261
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:09,430
Okay.

1262
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:19,685
‐What is this?
‐Just a little gift.

1263
01:02:19,778 --> 01:02:22,908
Just to say thank you for making
our family reunion a great one.

1264
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:26,990
Yeah, a film fanatic gift bag
for all your

1265
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:28,788
Christmas binge‐watching.

1266
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:31,580
Calvin, this is so sweet.

1267
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:33,125
I mean, you’re gonna share it
with me, right,

1268
01:02:33,208 --> 01:02:34,918
when I come over
to binge‐watch with you?

1269
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:38,301
But you’re welcome.

1270
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:40,380
Oh, my God, you guys,
I’m so sorry, I just had to take

1271
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:42,005
like, a hundred calls,
and I really hope

1272
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:43,633
you saved me some food.

1273
01:02:45,845 --> 01:02:48,255
Okay, w‐w‐what’s goin’ on here?
Did... What did I miss?

1274
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:51,308
‐Uh, nothing. Mn‐mn.
‐Nothing at all. Mn‐mn.

1275
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:54,314
Okay, um, anyways,
how would you two

1276
01:02:54,396 --> 01:02:56,556
like to come with me
to Ms. Pia Perna’s

1277
01:02:56,648 --> 01:02:58,228
rockin’ holiday party
tomorrow night?

1278
01:02:58,316 --> 01:03:00,526
Wait! You mean the Pia Perna?

1279
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:02,822
‐Like, the music producer?
‐Yeah.

1280
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:05,994
Like, the one who produced
my entire album. Hello!

1281
01:03:06,074 --> 01:03:08,034
Amy, you actually met her
the same day you met me

1282
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:09,289
at the salon, remember?

1283
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:12,829
‐Oh, wait. She was so young.
‐She is.

1284
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:16,134
Which means that this party
is gonna be fun, right?

1285
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:19,842
‐Definitely.
‐Definitely.

1286
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:22,923
Okay, so t‐this is gonna be
a thing now.

1287
01:03:23,008 --> 01:03:24,968
You guys are just gonna
start talking together?

1288
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:27,091
‐No.
‐Uh, no. Mn‐mn.

1289
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:42,281
None of these look great.

1290
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,030
I’m going to a gorgeously famous
producer’s party

1291
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:47,375
with an equally
gorgeously famous singer.

1292
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:49,700
You are equally as gorgeous,
okay?

1293
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:53,786
And you looked great
in all of those.

1294
01:03:53,872 --> 01:03:56,002
‐Really?
‐Um, yeah.

1295
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:57,632
I think the real question is

1296
01:03:57,709 --> 01:04:00,289
who are you trying
to look amazing for.

1297
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:03,508
And if we’re talking
about Calvin,

1298
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:04,760
that one.

1299
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:08,053
This one? Okay.

1300
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:19,190
Tiffany, when are Mona
and your dad getting here?

1301
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:22,232
They’re not coming, they said
Jonah’s Secret Santa exchange

1302
01:04:22,317 --> 01:04:24,027
at school ran late, so...

1303
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:27,570
Ugh, so Mona’s leaving me here
with all these young people?

1304
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:31,025
‐I’m gonna need a drink.
‐But you don’t drink.

1305
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:32,907
I’ll make it a virgin.

1306
01:04:34,996 --> 01:04:37,576
So, what did you think
of the album?

1307
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:40,245
Well, I‐I told Tiffany
I thought it was amazing.

1308
01:04:40,335 --> 01:04:43,925
I mean, the album covers
and the singles are perfect.

1309
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:47,085
<i>December Dreams</i> deserves
all the attention it’s getting.

1310
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:50,605
Aww. Thank you. And that one
was totally my baby, too.

1311
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:54,770
‐Oh, yeah? You did a great job.
‐Oh, stop. Seriously.

1312
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:57,101
But not really.

1313
01:04:57,185 --> 01:04:59,565
Now, if we can just get
<i>Frostbitten</i> to become a hit,

1314
01:04:59,646 --> 01:05:02,106
right, we’ll definitely get
a new record deal.

1315
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:05,650
One hundred percent. Done.

1316
01:05:05,777 --> 01:05:10,197
<i>♪ Fa‐la la‐la‐la la‐la‐la‐la ♪</i>

1317
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:14,791

1323
01:05:43,565 --> 01:05:44,655
Hm.

1324
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:50,781
Wow! She actually came.

1325
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:56,664
You look...

1326
01:05:57,454 --> 01:05:59,084
I mean...

1327
01:05:59,164 --> 01:06:00,414
I have nothin’.

1328
01:06:00,498 --> 01:06:02,328
I will take that
as a compliment.

1329
01:06:02,417 --> 01:06:04,837
Yeah. I’m speechless.

1330
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:07,959
Well, I will say this, I didn’t
go shopping for this dress.

1331
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:11,837
I just happened to have it
and I threw it on.

1332
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:13,506
This was definitely
the right choice.

1333
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:17,012
Amy!

1334
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:19,098
You made it! Yay!

1335
01:06:19,184 --> 01:06:21,444
I’m so happy you came.

1336
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:23,309
And that dress
looks great on you.

1337
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:24,976
It sure does.

1338
01:06:26,858 --> 01:06:28,988
I think I’m gonna get a drink.
You want one?

1339
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:32,658
‐Please, a double.
‐Okay.

1340
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:39,247
Hi, can I get a Cosmo, please?
Oh, did you want another?

1341
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:40,620
Yeah, uh, Shirley Temple,
please.

1342
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:43,165
‐Thank you.
‐Of course.

1343
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:46,289
So did you see
that Amy outside?

1344
01:06:46,377 --> 01:06:48,497
The family reunion
event‐planner.

1345
01:06:48,588 --> 01:06:50,628
Oh, right, yeah, uh,
she’s out back

1346
01:06:50,715 --> 01:06:52,925
with your son swooning over her.

1347
01:06:53,051 --> 01:06:54,971
‐Oh.
‐Pia!

1348
01:06:55,053 --> 01:06:58,393
‐Frankie. Hi. Merry Christmas.
‐Hello. Merry Christmas.

1349
01:06:58,473 --> 01:07:00,733
‐Thanks so much for having me.
‐Thank you for coming.

1350
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:03,560
Oh, Frankie, this is Eve.
Eve is Tiff’s aunt.

1351
01:07:03,645 --> 01:07:05,235
‐Eve, Frankie Diaz.
‐Hello.

1352
01:07:05,313 --> 01:07:07,233
Hey there, very nice
to meet you. Happy holidays.

1353
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:08,647
Well, Merry Christmas
to you, too.

1354
01:07:08,733 --> 01:07:11,243
‐Thank you.
‐So how do you know our Tiffany?

1355
01:07:11,319 --> 01:07:14,779
Oh, right.
Well, Pia and I go way back.

1356
01:07:14,906 --> 01:07:16,986
I heard Tiffany was looking
for an event designer,

1357
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:19,165
and I tried to get the gig,
but didn’t work out.

1358
01:07:19,244 --> 01:07:21,754
But aren’t you
with Diaz Designs?

1359
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:23,999
Well, I am Diaz Designs.

1360
01:07:24,082 --> 01:07:26,382
‐My family owns it.
‐Oh!

1361
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:28,499
But we did hire you.

1362
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:30,546
Your event planner, Amy.

1363
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:35,546
So I was gonna ask you.

1364
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:38,515
I know you have the reunion

1365
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:40,886
on the eve of Christmas Eve

1366
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:42,684
and then Christmas
with your parents.

1367
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:45,597
Me and, me and my mom.

1368
01:07:45,687 --> 01:07:48,227
But I don’t have
any Christmas Eve plans.

1369
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:51,864
So if you don’t either,
I was thinking,

1370
01:07:51,943 --> 01:07:55,073
you and I could watch
Christmas movies if you want.

1371
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:58,124
‐I would actually love that.
‐Yeah?

1372
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:03,699
‐Uh, but...
‐Let me guess.

1373
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:05,748
You already have a New Year’s
event plan for work, huh?

1374
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:08,132
No, no, it’s not that,
it’s just...

1375
01:08:08,209 --> 01:08:10,959
‐What is it?
‐The‐the truth is...

1376
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:13,457
‐Yeah?
‐My job‐‐

1377
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:15,970
What job, dear?

1378
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:18,642
’Cause as far as I can tell,
you don’t have a job now.

1379
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:20,510
Frankie?
What are you doing here?

1380
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:24,308
‐Frankie, hi.
‐Tiffany, hi. How are you?

1381
01:08:24,392 --> 01:08:25,642
I’m good. How are you?

1382
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:27,438
‐Merry Christmas.
‐Merry Christmas.

1383
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,940
Let me tell you,
your girl here is killing it.

1384
01:08:30,023 --> 01:08:31,863
Oh, no, not really killing it,

1385
01:08:31,983 --> 01:08:34,283
because she quit,
and took his gig.

1386
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,320
Well, that’s not entirely true.

1387
01:08:36,404 --> 01:08:38,574
Oh, really, Amy?
Well, then what is true?

1388
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:41,326
Because Frankie said
you took his job

1389
01:08:41,409 --> 01:08:43,739
that our family was considering
his company for.

1390
01:08:43,828 --> 01:08:45,828
Or did you just
not realize that?

1391
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:48,253
Tiffany, look,
I was meaning to tell you.

1392
01:08:48,333 --> 01:08:51,673
‐I did work for Frankie‐‐
‐Before you took my client.

1393
01:08:51,753 --> 01:08:53,673
I mean, what else is there
to explain, Amy?

1394
01:08:53,755 --> 01:08:55,845
That maybe
you stole my ideas, too?

1395
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:59,763
You worked for me.
Your ideas were mine.

1396
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:01,264
Or did you not read
your contract

1397
01:09:01,346 --> 01:09:02,676
you signed upon your hire?

1398
01:09:02,764 --> 01:09:03,974
Tiffany,

1399
01:09:04,057 --> 01:09:05,677
I was meaning to tell you this,
but‐‐

1400
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:07,768
She was hoping to wait
until she got final payment.

1401
01:09:07,852 --> 01:09:09,022
‐I’m fairly sure.
‐Okay.

1402
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:10,523
Could you guys take this
out front?

1403
01:09:10,605 --> 01:09:12,825
This is really not a good look
for Tiffany.

1404
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:14,529
Well, don’t you worry
about that.

1405
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:17,489
‐Calvin, I’m ready to go.
‐No problem, mom.

1406
01:09:18,446 --> 01:09:19,816
Uh...

1407
01:09:21,032 --> 01:09:22,702
I’ll see you later.

1408
01:09:29,082 --> 01:09:31,462
We should talk about this
another day.

1409
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:36,052
I will just see myself out.

1410
01:09:38,216 --> 01:09:41,296
And you’ll surely be hearing
from my lawyer.

1411
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:44,808
Merry Christmas, Ames.

1412
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:48,349
‐Just have a misunderstanding.
‐Right.

1413
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:51,234
And we spoke most of the time
and she told me‐‐

1414
01:09:51,354 --> 01:09:52,654
Calvin!

1415
01:09:55,316 --> 01:09:57,646
I’ll meet you at the car.

1416
01:09:57,735 --> 01:09:59,395
I’m sorry.

1417
01:09:59,487 --> 01:10:02,527
I‐I meant to tell you.

1418
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:05,865
‐I tried to tell you.
‐Yeah, but you didn’t.

1419
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:10,583
I gotta go, Amy.

1420
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:43,659
‐Oh, thanks, sweetheart.
‐Here.

1421
01:10:43,781 --> 01:10:46,031
Oh, that’ll be Amy
with the last of the drop‐offs.

1422
01:10:46,117 --> 01:10:48,117
‐Would you grab that, hon?
‐Certainly.

1423
01:10:54,125 --> 01:10:56,885
Kayleigh, hi! Where’s Amy?

1424
01:10:56,961 --> 01:10:59,301
Uh, Amy’s actually
not feeling great,

1425
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:01,920
so I’ll be taking over for
the remainder of the project.

1426
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:03,758
Um, she’ll be issuing
a full refund

1427
01:11:03,843 --> 01:11:06,473
for the inconvenience, but...

1428
01:11:06,554 --> 01:11:08,974
‐May I come in?
‐Well, sure, come on.

1429
01:11:14,854 --> 01:11:18,114
Look at that, candy‐cane lane.

1430
01:11:18,191 --> 01:11:20,941
‐Told you.
‐What’d you tell me?

1431
01:11:21,027 --> 01:11:23,147
What exactly did you tell me?

1432
01:11:27,742 --> 01:11:29,082
Aunt Alma.

1433
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:32,325
Auntie?

1434
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,130
Kayleigh.

1435
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:38,340
I didn’t know you were

1436
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:39,839
stopping by, I was just,

1437
01:11:39,921 --> 01:11:40,961
uh, heading out.

1438
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:43,337
Amy is not here today?

1439
01:11:43,466 --> 01:11:47,846
Yeah, um, she asked me
to cover the rest of the event,

1440
01:11:47,929 --> 01:11:50,139
given the circumstances.

1441
01:11:50,223 --> 01:11:51,853
But I’m actually glad
you’re here

1442
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:54,274
because I wanted to tell you

1443
01:11:54,352 --> 01:11:57,352
it’s my fault, the way
that everything went down.

1444
01:11:58,564 --> 01:12:00,984
What’s your fault?

1445
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:04,277
Amy did wanna tell Tiffany
that we left Frankie’s company.

1446
01:12:04,362 --> 01:12:09,072
But I said that I would take
care of it and then I just

1447
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:12,160
didn’t take care of it.

1448
01:12:12,245 --> 01:12:14,755
I was just so mad at Frankie
for trying to take this gig

1449
01:12:14,872 --> 01:12:17,672
away from Amy
and use the designs himself.

1450
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:20,380
He was a terrible boss to her.

1451
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:22,341
She was up for a big promotion,

1452
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:26,511
and he used his
family connections to take it.

1453
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:29,642
Then he was going to literally
take the ideas

1454
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:31,180
that Tiffany loved, use them,

1455
01:12:31,264 --> 01:12:33,064
and not let Amy
design her own work.

1456
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:36,312
Wow. That’s pretty insane.

1457
01:12:36,394 --> 01:12:37,524
‐I didn’t know.
‐You know...

1458
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:38,653
After hearing all this

1459
01:12:38,729 --> 01:12:40,689
and actually meeting that man,

1460
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:42,523
I’m not surprised.

1461
01:12:42,608 --> 01:12:44,568
Yeah, well, we really are sorry

1462
01:12:44,652 --> 01:12:46,742
for the way
that everything went down.

1463
01:12:46,821 --> 01:12:49,241
And if you wanna bring someone
else in to work the event...

1464
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:51,615
‐We understand.
‐Hm.

1465
01:12:51,742 --> 01:12:53,992
Either way, Amy said
it’s probably not a good idea

1466
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:56,078
for her to come, so...

1467
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:58,793
Unless you feel otherwise,

1468
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:01,586
I’ll be here Saturday
for the event alone.

1469
01:13:01,669 --> 01:13:03,249
‐Yeah.
‐Hm.

1470
01:13:05,089 --> 01:13:09,009
Hey, where’d these come from?
Amy didn’t mention these.

1471
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:11,723
Yeah, uh...

1472
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:14,184
They are a special gift
from Amy for the whole family

1473
01:13:14,265 --> 01:13:16,025
since you guys
never exchange gifts.

1474
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:18,770
Don’t worry,
it’s outside the budget.

1475
01:13:18,853 --> 01:13:21,063
Just something she wanted to do.

1476
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:33,528
I guess you kinda
liked that girl, didn’t you?

1477
01:13:33,618 --> 01:13:38,248
Yeah, I kinda did, actually.
How did you know?

1478
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:40,621
I know what you look like
when you’re smitten.

1479
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:42,628
Hm.

1480
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:45,920
Your father used to look at me
that way.

1481
01:13:46,005 --> 01:13:47,805
And I guess

1482
01:13:47,924 --> 01:13:51,304
I was kind of
a complicated woman as well.

1483
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:53,925
You still are, mother.

1484
01:13:54,013 --> 01:13:57,223
‐And you like that.
‐

1485
01:13:57,308 --> 01:13:59,888
‐This is sweet.
‐It is.

1486
01:14:15,493 --> 01:14:17,793
‐Tiffany? Hey.
‐Hi.

1487
01:14:18,746 --> 01:14:21,826
Eve. Hi.

1488
01:14:21,916 --> 01:14:24,836
‐May we come in?
‐Of course. Yeah.

1489
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:28,382
This is quite tasteful.

1490
01:14:28,506 --> 01:14:31,336
Thank you. That means a lot
coming from you.

1491
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:35,100
I got all of your voicemails.

1492
01:14:35,179 --> 01:14:37,679
All five of them.

1493
01:14:37,765 --> 01:14:39,815
As well as three emails.

1494
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:41,982
Right, a‐and I wanted
to apologize

1495
01:14:42,061 --> 01:14:43,731
to you in person, but I‐‐

1496
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:46,694
But you’ve already done that
eight times.

1497
01:14:46,774 --> 01:14:49,284
Which is more than enough.

1498
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,200
Look, the reason why we’re here

1499
01:14:51,278 --> 01:14:53,028
is because we wanted to say
thank you.

1500
01:14:53,114 --> 01:14:55,164
I stopped by Aunt Alma’s
this morning,

1501
01:14:55,241 --> 01:14:57,531
and the reunion you put together

1502
01:14:57,660 --> 01:15:00,160
is simply amazing.

1503
01:15:06,043 --> 01:15:08,883
Well, I‐I’m really glad
you guys are happy.

1504
01:15:09,005 --> 01:15:11,345
And Aunt Eve here told me

1505
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:14,224
about everything else
as well, so...

1506
01:15:14,301 --> 01:15:16,011
‐Everything else?
‐Yeah.

1507
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:18,855
About Frankie
being a total jerk,

1508
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:20,391
him trying
to take this gig from you

1509
01:15:20,474 --> 01:15:24,064
and just being a crappy human,
period.

1510
01:15:24,145 --> 01:15:25,315
Right.

1511
01:15:25,396 --> 01:15:28,976
So we’re sorry
that that happened.

1512
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:31,986
But it still doesn’t take back
the fact that

1513
01:15:32,069 --> 01:15:35,739
what you did was inexcusable.

1514
01:15:35,823 --> 01:15:37,993
That’s right,
and so we feel the only way

1515
01:15:38,075 --> 01:15:40,735
that you could truly
make it up to us

1516
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:43,910
is for you to attend
our family reunion,

1517
01:15:43,998 --> 01:15:46,418
to ensure
that nothing else goes wrong.

1518
01:15:47,626 --> 01:15:50,086
Wait. Seriously?

1519
01:15:50,171 --> 01:15:52,841
Plus, I mean, it already feels
like you’re part of the family,

1520
01:15:52,923 --> 01:15:56,683
so it would be a real shame
if you missed it.

1521
01:15:56,761 --> 01:15:59,761
I know
my son would feel that way.

1522
01:15:59,847 --> 01:16:02,137
You did break his heart.

1523
01:16:02,266 --> 01:16:04,556
And the least you could do
is come back,

1524
01:16:04,643 --> 01:16:07,103
so you could give him
his only Christmas wish.

1525
01:16:09,607 --> 01:16:11,567
Which is?

1526
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:14,240
You, my dear.

1527
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:18,030
I’ll admit
I was a little bit resistant

1528
01:16:18,115 --> 01:16:20,155
at first.

1529
01:16:20,284 --> 01:16:22,744
But I could see

1530
01:16:22,828 --> 01:16:24,828
the minute you walked
into the room with Calvin

1531
01:16:24,955 --> 01:16:28,125
that the two of you
were feelin’ each other.

1532
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:31,420
I’m just a protective
mama‐bear type is all.

1533
01:16:31,504 --> 01:16:34,884
I thought you didn’t like me
because,

1534
01:16:34,965 --> 01:16:37,675
I don’t know, I said something
off‐putting or‐‐

1535
01:16:37,802 --> 01:16:41,812
Amy, if you ever said anything
off‐putting,

1536
01:16:41,889 --> 01:16:44,269
I wouldn’t be afraid
to talk to you about it, okay?

1537
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:47,940
‐Trust me. Right.
‐Nor would I. Okay?

1538
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:52,730
Well, thank you. A‐and your
family means so much to me.

1539
01:16:52,817 --> 01:16:54,737
Especially Calvin.

1540
01:16:54,819 --> 01:16:57,739
I just wanna make sure
that I’m listening.

1541
01:16:58,489 --> 01:16:59,819
You are.

1542
01:17:00,991 --> 01:17:03,161
Just took me a minute

1543
01:17:03,244 --> 01:17:07,254
to get used to the idea

1544
01:17:07,331 --> 01:17:10,251
and really see who you are.

1545
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:12,674
So, do you wanna come
to our family reunion?

1546
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:15,345
We’d still love to have you.

1547
01:17:15,422 --> 01:17:17,882
‐I would love to.
‐Yay!

1548
01:17:18,008 --> 01:17:21,178
Okay, good. Phew! Ah...

1549
01:17:21,262 --> 01:17:23,102
‐Cheers.
‐Cheers.

1550
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:32,688

How you doin’, Aunt Alma?
You’re not overwhelmed, are you?

1562
01:18:06,891 --> 01:18:09,521
Are you kidding me?
I live for this!

1563

‐
‐I know you do.

1564
01:18:11,729 --> 01:18:13,979
I only wish
that Gladys was here to see it.

1565
01:18:14,064 --> 01:18:16,024
‐Aw...
‐Ah, don’t we all, Auntie Alma?

1566
01:18:16,108 --> 01:18:18,988
Yeah.
She sure could throw a party.

1567
01:18:19,069 --> 01:18:21,529
But, Tiffany,
what you did here, thank you.

1568
01:18:21,614 --> 01:18:23,454
It’s amazing
what you did for the family.

1569
01:18:23,574 --> 01:18:26,124
Thank you.
Anything for the family, right?

1570
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:28,203
I mean, that’s what
Christmas is all about

1571
01:18:28,287 --> 01:18:30,747
and what the Christmas family
is all about.

1572
01:18:30,873 --> 01:18:33,423
‐That’s right.
‐Oh, wow!

1573
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:35,592
Look at you,
little handsome man.

1574
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:37,879
Aunt Tiffany,
you sure look pretty, too.

1575
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:39,723
‐Almost as pretty as my mom.
‐Thank you. Ah!

1576
01:18:39,798 --> 01:18:41,878
‐Ah!
‐My little man.

1577
01:18:41,967 --> 01:18:43,427
And my biggest fan.

1578
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:47,562
Well, one of them.
And speaking of fans...

1579
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:50,430
Attention, everyone!

1580
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:54,269
But, uh, I think we have
a special guest here tonight.

1581
01:18:56,190 --> 01:18:59,440
There we go. There’s
my little man of the house!

1582
01:18:59,526 --> 01:19:02,526
Oh, my goodness!

1583
01:19:02,613 --> 01:19:04,363
Oh, my God!

1584
01:19:04,448 --> 01:19:07,448
I tried, but mom keeps
bossing me around instead.

1585
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:09,866
I thought you weren’t coming
till the 27th!

1586
01:19:09,954 --> 01:19:11,714
Well, I couldn’t miss
the Christmas family reunion.

1587
01:19:11,789 --> 01:19:13,289
‐Now, could I?
‐Well, you know what?

1588
01:19:13,374 --> 01:19:14,544
I know you better get over here

1589
01:19:14,625 --> 01:19:16,045
and give your mother a big hug.

1590
01:19:16,126 --> 01:19:17,536
‐Oh, my, look at you!
‐Of course. Hey, mama.

1591
01:19:17,628 --> 01:19:19,708
‐Look at you. Good to see you.
‐Oh!

1592
01:19:19,797 --> 01:19:21,797
‐Are you eatin’ okay?
‐I’m‐I’m a military man.

1593
01:19:21,882 --> 01:19:23,342
‐I have to be in shape.
‐I know, baby.

1594
01:19:23,467 --> 01:19:26,087
‐All right?
‐You in shape. Look at my...

1595
01:19:26,178 --> 01:19:28,468
Auntie, you’re lookin’ gorgeous
over there.

1596
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:32,890
‐Look at your cousin. Hi.
‐Right.

1597
01:19:32,977 --> 01:19:35,897
‐So good to have him back.
‐Yeah.

1598
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:38,230
‐

1599
01:19:38,315 --> 01:19:39,315
Good to see you.

1600
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:40,730
This is turning into

1601
01:19:40,818 --> 01:19:43,108
the most fabulous Christmas,
after all.

1602
01:19:43,195 --> 01:19:44,485
Yeah, sure is, huh?

1603
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:46,413
Aunt Alma even made
some decent candy canes.

1604
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:49,240
‐Okay, got that right finally.
‐All right.

1605
01:19:49,326 --> 01:19:50,866
Thank you. Thank you.

1606
01:19:50,995 --> 01:19:53,665
She’s finally following
your Grandma Gladys’ recipe.

1607
01:19:53,747 --> 01:19:56,667
‐Yeah, she is.
‐My goodness. Mm.

1608
01:19:58,419 --> 01:20:01,419
And, honey, thanks in good part

1609
01:20:01,505 --> 01:20:03,665
to you and all that you’ve done,

1610
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:07,509
we have nearly raised
over $10,000

1611
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:11,216
from family donations
for Stan’s Stockings.

1612
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:12,808
‐We did?
‐We did.

1613
01:20:12,891 --> 01:20:14,601
‐Wow.
‐Oh, honey.

1614
01:20:14,685 --> 01:20:17,775
You are such a marvelous man,
you know that?

1615
01:20:17,855 --> 01:20:19,985
‐I’m very proud of you.
‐Thank you.

1616
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:22,605
And you know your dad is here.

1617
01:20:22,693 --> 01:20:26,863
He’s here with us. And I know
he’s proud of you, too.

1618
01:20:26,947 --> 01:20:29,657
‐Merry Christmas, baby.
‐Merry Christmas, mama.

1619
01:20:29,742 --> 01:20:32,542
‐Love you.
‐Love you, baby.

1620
01:20:34,997 --> 01:20:37,997
All right, now go and say hi
to the person

1621
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:40,463
who got this thing all together.

1622
01:20:41,879 --> 01:20:43,839
Ma, Amy’s not here.

1623
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:46,132
Mm. She is, though.

1624
01:20:47,134 --> 01:20:48,394
Over there.

1625
01:20:49,887 --> 01:20:51,557
Surprise.

1626
01:20:54,058 --> 01:20:56,558
So Christmas miracles
do come true.

1627
01:20:57,561 --> 01:20:58,521
Go.

1628
01:21:12,618 --> 01:21:14,868
Well, aren’t you gonna thank me?

1629
01:21:14,953 --> 01:21:16,543
‐For what?
‐For saving your money.

1630
01:21:16,622 --> 01:21:18,212
On a reunion photographer,
of course.

1631
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:19,500
Oh!

1632
01:21:21,335 --> 01:21:24,755
‐Thank you.
‐And thank you.

1633
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,670
You did an amazing job
on this reunion, Amy.

1634
01:21:27,758 --> 01:21:31,218
You didn’t even know my family
just a few weeks ago.

1635
01:21:31,303 --> 01:21:33,143
Now it’s like
you’ve known us forever.

1636
01:21:33,263 --> 01:21:34,933
What can I say?

1637
01:21:35,015 --> 01:21:37,515
My family is not really
in the Christmas spirit

1638
01:21:37,601 --> 01:21:42,231
and... yours just

1639
01:21:42,314 --> 01:21:43,614
inspired me.

1640
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:46,070
Well, maybe your family
could come around.

1641
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:48,321
We’ll be happy to have ’em
at the next reunion.

1642
01:21:48,445 --> 01:21:51,405
You know, get them
into the holiday spirit.

1643
01:21:53,117 --> 01:21:55,237
‐I think they’d like that. Yeah.
‐Yeah?

1644
01:21:55,327 --> 01:21:56,787
How about you, Amy?

1645
01:21:59,123 --> 01:22:02,333
‐Would you like that?
‐What?

1646
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:03,959
To be at the next reunion.

1647
01:22:04,044 --> 01:22:06,464
’Cause I’d really like
to have you at all of ’em.

1648
01:22:06,588 --> 01:22:09,878
‐Oh.
‐If I had it my way, actually.

1649
01:22:09,967 --> 01:22:12,137
Well, you know
I like to be put to work.

1650
01:22:12,219 --> 01:22:14,639
All right,
you come to the reunions

1651
01:22:14,721 --> 01:22:17,811
and I promise to share the table
with the best view with you.

1652
01:22:17,891 --> 01:22:19,141
Ah.

1653
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:25,940
‐Deal.
‐Deal.

1654
01:22:30,571 --> 01:22:31,951
All right, everyone!

1655
01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:34,910
And now it is time for another

1656
01:22:34,992 --> 01:22:37,742
annual Christmas family tradition.

1657
01:22:37,828 --> 01:22:39,288
We do this at my mom’s house.

1658
01:22:39,371 --> 01:22:41,711
Christmas caroling and hot coca.

1659
01:22:41,832 --> 01:22:44,132
