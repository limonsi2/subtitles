3
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:06,166
The little one is going crazy.

4
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:22,500
Marie's having her baby!

5
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,416
I know, man. That is so cool.

6
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,833
No! Now!

7
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:31,166
Hey, I'll sort this out, okay?
I'll get you out of here.

8
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,208
But The Strokes are about to play.

9
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:37,416
Maybe you should call my sister instead.

10
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,125
Sarah? No, absolutely not.

11
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:42,666
I'll sort this out.
I'll get you out of here.

12
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:56,041
I'm going to be a father!

13
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:57,666
I'm going to be a father!

14
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:03,125
Hey, we need a doctor. We need a doctor.

15
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,250
Are you a doctor?

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,791
Her water broke. Three weeks early.

17
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:12,375
Can you help us?

18
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,916
Honey, breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

19
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,041
So? Can you see anything?

20
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,583
Please quit headbanging?

21
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:31,208
Yeah, yeah, stop banging. Stop banging.

22
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:35,208
I don't want to give birth at a festival.

23
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,375
-Me neither.
-Me neither.

24
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,666
Jesus was born in a stable, right?
Nothing wrong with that.

25
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,500
Call my sister. Now.

26
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:11,416
You're as beautiful as your mom.

27
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,041
Shit, that's awesome.

28
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,458
Great. Cursing in front of Ben?

29
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:18,791
You have a key?

30
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:21,083
Come on, say hello to your cousin.

31
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,250
Marie is sleeping.

32
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:24,708
Hello.

33
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:27,041
-Come to Aunt Sarah.
-Sarah.

34
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,291
Come to me.

35
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:35,125
Yes, you look just like
your mom, you lucky guy.

36
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,958
Little baby...

37
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,708
Mom, that's enough.

38
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,000
So, what's life like at 15?

39
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,875
I was at a party until 9:30.

40
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,166
Then Mom came.

41
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,833
You can never be too careful.

42
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,375
Yes, you can.

43
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,958
Who goes to a festival
with a pregnant girlfriend?

44
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:01,375
We had tickets for nine months.
Marie also wanted to go.

45
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,916
From the gas station?

46
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,000
Yes, that's fine.

47
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:10,916
Noah?

48
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Can we talk in the kitchen?

49
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,583
No, thanks.

50
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,791
Sarah. Sarah.

51
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,250
What...

52
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:22,333
-What are you doing?
-Krav Maga.

53
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:23,750
Cool.

54
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,125
Now listen to me very carefully.

55
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,625
Your old life, over.

56
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:33,166
And your new one is all about
my sister and that baby. Is that clear?

57
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,208
Yes. Clear.

58
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,791
Yes.

59
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,083
No, you don't understand.

60
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,333
Every day,

61
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:48,333
the world out there will seek
Ben's innocent little soul

62
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,333
-and try to break it.
-Okay.

63
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:51,583
Always and again.

64
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,416
You have to protect him

65
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,541
-and not make it worse.
-Okay, okay, okay.

66
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,166
I know that look, Noah.

67
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,833
I've seen it twice before.
Two kids, two marriages.

68
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,708
I know how that ends.

69
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:10,416
Nothing scares guys like you
more than being a dad.

70
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:16,666
Now it's time to get balls, Noah. Balls!

71
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,416
Balls. Yes, big balls.

72
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,875
Balls.

73
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:23,708
I don't know if they'll be
as big as yours, but...

74
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,208
Not funny.

75
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,416
I had to let this out. A hug?

76
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,250
For the new dad?

77
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:44,625
I'll pass.

78
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,958
-Come here.
-Nah.

79
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,750
-Great.
-Hello.

80
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,041
Sweetie.

81
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,625
-Glad you're here.
-He is perfect.

82
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,250
You made a perfect baby.

83
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,416
You mean "we."

84
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,541
For a beautiful picture,
I praise the painter and not the brush.

85
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:20,625
FOUR MONTHS LATER

86
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,708
Day or night, I'll pick you up

87
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:29,166
I'll go through red lights in the city
I'll pick you up

88
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,958
It doesn't matter where you are
I'll pick you up

89
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,666
It takes a call
I'll be there and pick you up

90
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,000
Guys...

91
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,291
Somehow it still doesn't bang.

92
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:47,458
Do you have any ideas on how
we can beef it up?

93
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:54,541
Tibo, maybe we should change some lyrics.

94
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:58,166
Honestly, I don't think
it's about the lyrics.

95
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,333
-It's the beat.
-We could...

96
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:03,666
No, no, no. Not you with
your autotune again. Come on.

97
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:06,958
How many BPM are you at?

98
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:10,916
-One hundred twenty-eight.
-Noah...

99
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,750
Just curious.

100
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:15,958
Sorry...

101
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:19,041
My junior assistant, Noah, was chatting.

102
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,000
That's cool. Let him speak.

103
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,458
Maybe he has a great idea?

104
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,375
Okay, then talk.

105
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:33,208
Yes, come up front.

106
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,916
Yes.

107
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,750
-Hi.
-Hey.

108
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:44,208
I don't know. 128 BPM is perfect for

109
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,291
Beat's a bit electronic.

110
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:51,625
Snare on two, the four comes,
pushes the song forward.

111
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:54,083
Instead of...

112
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:57,208
Just go right in.

113
00:07:57,291 --> 00:08:00,041
It doesn't matter what you say
I'll pick you up

114
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:05,958
If it is red
Drive through the city...

115
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:08,083
Okay, thanks. Enough.

116
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,333
That's it?

117
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,666
Yes.

118
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,708
Good, then go and get pizza for everyone.

119
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,041
Yes.

120
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,916
Hey, everyone starts
by getting pizza. So...

121
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,250
I tell you, dude,
if they simply did what I say.

122
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:27,666
-So you could hear it.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

123
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:32,250
-And how are things at home?
-It's a state of emergency.

124
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,291
Marie is going back to work soon.

125
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,916
Wow. Already? Why?

126
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,833
This is what we agreed to.
In the first year, each takes over half.

127
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,333
And? Does this work?

128
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,125
Yes, her half was fine.

129
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,000
Now it's my turn.

130
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:50,041
I change his nappy, I feed him.

131
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,000
I warm up the bottles.

132
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,875
Yes, we spend quality time together.

133
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:58,916
Like father and son.

134
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:04,250
But, you know, Baumi,
some things really don't work at all.

135
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:07,000
I mean, he has never fallen asleep
in my arms.

136
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:19,250
Cultivate that further. Best tactic,
screw up until others say, "Leave it."

137
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:23,333
No. Baumi, he's my son.
I want this to work.

138
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:27,166
As soon as you're a father,
you forget your best life strategies?

139
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,458
Just kidding, hey. Get your baby.

140
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,125
-Yes, I will.
-Yes.

141
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,250
-No other choice.
-Yeah.

142
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:36,916
-Marie has a trade fair this weekend.
-Shit.

143
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,916
-No. No.
-No.

144
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,791
-No, it's fine.
-Fine.

145
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,541
-Yes.
-I'm taking over now.

146
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,500
Power up. Noah's Ark, go.

147
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:50,291
-Yes. Right.
-I will take responsibility.

148
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,250
I will take care of my baby.

149
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:53,416
You want what?

150
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,333
To watch Ben this weekend.

151
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,291
So we can test whether it works.

152
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:00,750
Why should we test it?

153
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,750
Sarah needs to know
if she can take the new job.

154
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:07,166
Or if I should take
a year of parental leave for Ben.

155
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,625
Parental leave?

156
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:15,833
We are Ben's parents.

157
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,000
-Yeah.
-Yeah. I call it this.

158
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:21,250
You can call it differently.
A "sabbatical" or so.

159
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,083
I'd like to do it for Marie.

160
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:28,375
No way. No way.
Absolutely no way. That's my job.

161
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:31,750
If you can't manage this,
a nanny will be really expensive.

162
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,291
Hello? What nanny?

163
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:36,375
I'm Ben's dad.
I can take care of him very well, Sarah.

164
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,041
Excuse me.

165
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,750
-Excuse me.
-Sarah.

166
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:43,875
Sorry.

167
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,125
Who does she think she is?

168
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:53,041
-She wants to help.
-No, she wants to discredit me.

169
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,541
Nonsense.

170
00:10:55,291 --> 00:11:00,666
Let's just give it a try with Sarah.
It could be a huge relief for both of us.

171
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:04,708
-She wants to give a year of her life.
-And take one of his from me.

172
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:08,125
On the contrary.
We could then go to the Tube again.

173
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:14,875
Someday. Maybe.
But I want to be here for Ben now, fully.

174
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,375
You are already.

175
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,833
Yes, but I want to prove
that I can handle it.

176
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,625
That I can take responsibility.

177
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,916
I know you can.

178
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,958
Okay.

179
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,291
So we don't do the test weekend
for Sarah, but for you.

180
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:41,125
And if you screw up, I'll be there.

181
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,416
-Sarah.
-It's fine.

182
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,791
Enough for four days.
Better safe than sorry.

183
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:57,666
Yeah, and if it lasts longer,
for babies, kebabs without spice.

184
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:02,083
-Only breast milk, nothing else.
-Yes.

185
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,666
What's that?

186
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,666
My grill tongs.

187
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:09,416
If his pacifier or cuddly caterpillar
falls down

188
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,416
the back of the car or something.

189
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,500
We can't all have arms as long as yours.

190
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:17,666
Okay.

191
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:22,666
I'm out. Okay.

192
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,166
Come to Daddy.

193
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:34,916
-I need that.
-Sorry.

194
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,416
Do I get one, too?

195
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:40,750
Bye.

196
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:44,958
Say bye. Say bye. Bye, Mommy.

197
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,208
Say bye-bye.

198
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:53,833
And now what, buddy?

199
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,875
What does Mommy do when you can't sleep?

200
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,166
Probably not the cool things Dad does.

201
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,083
Yes.

202
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:21,166
Are you in the mood
for a little adventure?

203
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:48,333
Come on, Ben. That was a great idea
with the roundabout.

204
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:53,125
Get some sleep.
Do yourself and Dad a little favor.

205
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,125
You know I'm under a little pressure.

206
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:05,041
-Hello?
-Yo! What's up!

207
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:07,916
Nothing. You?

208
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Nothing. Correcting chemistry tests.
But I have a solution.

209
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,583
Chemically?

210
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:16,125
Physically. For our standby friendship.

211
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:19,958
-For today?
-Not today, I'm with Ben. Forgotten?

212
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:23,125
-What? That's today?
-Yep.

213
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:27,500
Watch out. Hold on tight.
Today is the last concert at the Tube.

214
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,708
-What?
-Yes.

215
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:29,666
Stop it.

216
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,916
Dude, do you notice anything at all?

217
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,166
I canceled the newsletter
because I cry when I miss a concert.

218
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:40,791
Imagine you miss the last concert ever.
I mean ever, ever, ever.

219
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:45,041
-Are you kidding?
-No, man. They're closing our living room.

220
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,125
Forever.

221
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:50,666
Okay, call a babysitter.

222
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,250
Hello. Noah?

223
00:14:56,708 --> 00:15:00,375
-Wait a second. I need a moment.
-Man. You need a whole night.

224
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,041
-Ask Klara.
-I can't, Baumi.

225
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,916
-Why?
-Sarah is just waiting for that.

226
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,625
Then he must come.

227
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,708
-Baumi.
-Noah.

228
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,500
I won't take him to a concert.

229
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,291
Noah, it's our club.

230
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:19,916
We spent more time there than school,
at least awake.

231
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,541
I mean, we laughed, we cried, we danced...

232
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,833
Stop it. This sounds like a sappy song.

233
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,833
You met Marie there.

234
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:40,583
Hello? Are you even listening to me?

235
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:43,708
Hey, since you've been a father,
it's all about you.

236
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:47,916
And poor lonely Baumi is here
on a Saturday night correcting tests

237
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,541
instead of going to the last concert
at the Tube. I... Man, I'm still young.

238
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:55,833
I'm still alive. And I don't have a car.

239
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:58,666
Call a taxi.

240
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,250
I'm doing that.
And since I'm a good friend,

241
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:04,500
I remember what you told me
at our last concert

242
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,291
before Ben was born.

243
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:10,125
I can't wait to see this with Ben.

244
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:14,333
Today is your last chance.

245
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,833
Man, you're not sleeping anyway, are you?

246
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,541
Okay, watch out. I'll come with you.

247
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:30,458
Marie says
I have to trust myself more with him.

248
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,500
So, I mean, I...

249
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,708
I'll drive you over there.

250
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,833
-I'll be right there.
-Okay.

251
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,833
-Boom.
-Hello?

252
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,666
Please talk after the beep.

253
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:56,458
That was cool, wasn't it?

254
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:59,541
Now we get to pick up
the fine gentleman upstairs.

255
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,000
Jochen. Super timing.

256
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,958
-Have you seen Baumi?
-Baumi is on the roof.

257
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,458
Beer-pong duty.

258
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,666
Could you be kind and get him for me?
I have a baby.

259
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,791
Sorry. The pizza doesn't deliver itself.

260
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,916
-Is everything okay?
-I'm fine.

261
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,125
What? Hey.

262
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,708
Don't look like that.
I lived here once, too.

263
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:57,583
Yeah, look here. Sorry.

264
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,666
Baumi?

265
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,541
Noah?

266
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:08,333
-Hey.
-Oh, my God, you're here.

267
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,416
-How cool is that?
-How are you?

268
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,708
And what about your fear of heights?

269
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,250
Yes, thanks for pointing that out.

270
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,833
You two didn't see me here, okay?

271
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:21,291
I once read that acrophobia
can be smoked away.

272
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,583
Or was it the other way around?

273
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:27,375
That fear of heights comes
from smoking weed?

274
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,875
Because you're already high?

275
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:34,583
-Have you seen Baumi?
-He's somewhere around here.

276
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,875
Hey, baby. Does Ben want to dance?

277
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,625
-What?
-Does Ben want to dance?

278
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,791
Yes, yes, yes.

279
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,000
-Not for long.
-Yep, yep.

280
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,458
Hello, Ben.

281
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:52,541
Who wants to party?
Do you want to party?

282
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:57,916
Okay.

283
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,875
-Mimi...
-Yay.

284
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,958
My man.

285
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,000
Stop it.

286
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:15,166
-Come on now, I want to go.
-Yeah, yeah.

287
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,541
Do you remember the magic rainbows?

288
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,666
They are banging right now.

289
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,333
Hey, you have to drive.

290
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:28,541
I mixed it up a little. A bit here,
a bit there and then poof.

291
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:34,000
-If there where no teachers, right?
-It's about spreading knowledge.

292
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,208
Wait a minute.

293
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:39,333
-Baumi. Could we please...
-The right amount of sugar and fat.

294
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:42,875
-Baumi, please.
-I'll only hand them out briefly.

295
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:48,208
Hey, Mimi. Tell me...

296
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:51,333
Did you just do a body shot
in front of my son?

297
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:52,583
Body shots are funny.

298
00:19:58,208 --> 00:19:59,708
-Give him to me.
-No.

299
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:02,416
-Mimi, it's not funny.
-Come and get him.

300
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,666
Mimi, give...

301
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,416
It's not funny, okay? Now give him.

302
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,500
Yeah, it's nice here at the party.

303
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,208
Mimi, that's nasty. Come on.

304
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:13,958
You see, he doesn't want to.
He's holding my hair tight.

305
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:16,833
Thank you.

306
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,833
Hey, you'll never dance with her again.

307
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:26,875
Baumi. Hey. Baumi. Now or never.

308
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,333
-Okay, now, absolutely.
-Okay, hurry.

309
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,333
We're going to the Tube, man.

310
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:36,250
To a real party,
not a children's birthday like this.

311
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:37,708
Bye-bye.

312
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,791
Not a peep.

313
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:14,750
-Just wanted to say good night.
-I'm just putting him to bed.

314
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,250
Really?

315
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:19,166
It sounds like you're in the car.

316
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,416
Yes, I am.
It's supposed to be the best trick

317
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,791
and quieter than a vacuum cleaner.

318
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:28,291
-Noah...
-Babe, just down at the roundabout.

319
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,833
-All is fine.
-Just don't fall asleep.

320
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,333
Don't worry.

321
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,500
-Give him the keys.
-Noah?

322
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,791
-Everything okay?
-Yes, great.

323
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:47,041
-Noah?
-Yes. Tell me, how are you?

324
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:50,833
-Are you having fun?
-More like stress.

325
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:53,166
I'm running from
one appointment to the next.

326
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:56,750
-And you're calling me?
-I wanted to hear your voice.

327
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,916
-Mine or...
-Yours.

328
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:01,416
Okay, good.

329
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,875
Then don't stress yourself
and nothing else will happen now.

330
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,375
Nothing else?

331
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:10,541
Yes.

332
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:15,250
I think he fell asleep.

333
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:19,250
Yes, he fell asleep.
We'll chat tomorrow, babe, okay?

334
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:20,791
-Okay.
-Love you.

335
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,458
-Dude.
-What?

336
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:24,250
Noah?

337
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:36,708
-Yes?
-Hi.

338
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:39,583
What's wrong?

339
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:44,666
-You have to calm me down.
-What happened?

340
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:50,750
Noah is driving Ben around in the car
to get him to sleep, but he sounded weird.

341
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:51,875
I'm on my way.

342
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:53,791
-No.
-Yes, I am.

343
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:56,666
I just want to see if he needs help.
Problem solved.

344
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,916
-If he fucks up...
-He won't fuck up.

345
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,583
He'll fuck up!

346
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:07,166
Klara. I'm going to see Noah.
Look after your brother.

347
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:19,041
Henri, do you want
to sleep at a buddy's tonight?

348
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:21,375
-Cool. May I?
-Yes.

349
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:30,416
Noah Wittmann.

350
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,250
Noah Wittmann, hold on... I'll say it.

351
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:37,791
Noah, this is your favorite sister-in-law.

352
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:41,625
I am in front of your house,
but you are not there. Nor your car.

353
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:44,625
Something tells me
you're really fucking up right now.

354
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,000
I'm just wondering where...

355
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:03,541
-Isn't it great?
-I'm just driving you.

356
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:05,916
-You and me.
-I'm just taking you there.

357
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,416
-Two men and a baby.
-One man, two babies.

358
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,291
-Stop being uncool.
-What?

359
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:11,666
-Be cool.
-I am cool.

360
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,250
The cool one is going
to a concert tonight.

361
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:15,958
No way. Marie would kill me.

362
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:17,500
-He's your baby, too.
-Yeah.

363
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:22,375
Okay. Before you say "but" again,
Uncle Baumi thought ahead.

364
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:25,125
Here. Noise absorbing, 100%.

365
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:29,416
They have the same things for
Angelina Jolie's babies for concerts.

366
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,625
-What are you planning?
-Man, you know what?

367
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:35,166
The bass rocks the little ones to sleep.

368
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:38,208
For them, it's as if it were natural.
It's awesome.

369
00:24:42,208 --> 00:24:44,375
I have my own VIP section there.

370
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:47,583
-I don't know.
-Man.

371
00:24:47,666 --> 00:24:49,000
-Baumi.
-Noah.

372
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:50,500
-Baumi.
-It's the Tube.

373
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:52,000
I know.

374
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:01,375
What do you say?

375
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,125
-Yeah, baby.
-Hey, that wasn't a yes.

376
00:25:04,208 --> 00:25:06,166
Dude, that was baby talk for,

377
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:10,416
-"I want a cool dad."
-It was more like, "You'll get killed."

378
00:25:48,666 --> 00:25:50,791
No. No sugar, no carbs.

379
00:26:08,291 --> 00:26:10,708
Shit. Ben forgot his caterpillar.

380
00:26:11,916 --> 00:26:14,916
So he was here? Where did they go?

381
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:17,208
Both of them...

382
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:22,041
Okay. Listen up.
You don't want to mess with me.

383
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:26,291
I'm a lawyer for kid's TV
and kids' TV laws do not mess around.

384
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:28,416
So where did they go?

385
00:26:33,708 --> 00:26:35,125
Understood.

386
00:26:39,541 --> 00:26:41,541
Hey, man. Turn the music back on.

387
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:45,875
Yes, it's fine. Calm down.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's fine, I know.

388
00:26:45,958 --> 00:26:50,500
You want to party
and drink and be young.

389
00:26:50,583 --> 00:26:52,583
Let's do this quickly, okay?

390
00:26:52,666 --> 00:26:54,375
So, I'm looking for Noah.

391
00:26:54,458 --> 00:26:58,500
I know that he was here
and someone here knows where he was going.

392
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:00,666
He's on the road with Baumi, right?

393
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:03,250
-Are you his mother?
-Sister-in-law.

394
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:05,916
I promised Marie that
I would look after her baby.

395
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,541
So you are you Ben's grandma?

396
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:11,458
-Aunt. Have you seen Ben?
-Are you looking for Ben or Noah?

397
00:27:11,541 --> 00:27:16,583
Both. Even if that is inconceivable
for your little pea brain, yellow hat.

398
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:21,125
Dude, chill, we're just celebrating.
Some of us have had a hard week.

399
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:22,291
-Really?
-Yeah.

400
00:27:22,375 --> 00:27:25,041
-God. It was hard, yeah?
-Yes.

401
00:27:26,083 --> 00:27:29,375
You guys deserve a break, right?

402
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:35,791
You don't even have
the faintest idea what's hard.

403
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:39,000
Have you ever heard of "pseudo croup"?

404
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:42,541
No? You haven't?
That sounds something like this...

405
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:52,125
Imagine a little baby, your little baby.

406
00:27:52,208 --> 00:27:54,541
It's 2:00 in the morning
and then suddenly...

407
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:58,916
You grab the child, open the window,
nothing helps.

408
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,916
Still... Does it drown? Maybe.
In any case, it gasps and croaks.

409
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,250
So what do you? You take the child
to the bathroom,

410
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:09,291
which is filled with steam.

411
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:13,083
And then there
is your six-year-old daughter,

412
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:16,541
who has eaten
the whole cake from the refrigerator.

413
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:22,125
And now she pukes and chokes
while at the same time diarrhea sets in.

414
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:25,625
So you're stuck with hot steam
at 2:00 in the morning

415
00:28:25,708 --> 00:28:31,250
in a small room that basically smells like
the hot, humid fart of a gorilla.

416
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:32,875
That is hard.

417
00:28:33,791 --> 00:28:36,708
But you do it. You do it because you must.

418
00:28:36,833 --> 00:28:40,750
And because you love children.
And because for a long time,

419
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:44,208
it's not only about yourself!

420
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:52,833
And today, it's about my little nephew,

421
00:28:52,916 --> 00:28:56,333
who is in the hands of
two absolute idiots.

422
00:28:57,333 --> 00:29:01,250
So, who will tell me where they are now?

423
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:05,000
-They wanted to go to the Tube.
-Tom.

424
00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:11,583
-Where is the Tube?
-I'll take you there.

425
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:12,958
Great. Let's go.

426
00:29:13,833 --> 00:29:14,833
Come on.

427
00:29:15,625 --> 00:29:19,666
Wait a second. Who are you
and why are you at this idiotic party?

428
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,583
My name is Tom
and I live on the ground floor.

429
00:29:23,708 --> 00:29:25,666
Just to avoid any misunderstanding,

430
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:29,791
I'm not the type to go with weird men
and get into weird cars, okay?

431
00:29:29,875 --> 00:29:31,166
I don't have a car.

432
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:33,750
Great. We'll take mine.

433
00:29:35,625 --> 00:29:37,041
We'll take yours.

434
00:30:02,541 --> 00:30:05,041
Dude, this is the last time to say goodbye

435
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:08,333
to the place
where we got baked for the first time.

436
00:30:10,458 --> 00:30:13,750
The club where you first heard
the sound of N.E.R.D.

437
00:30:16,375 --> 00:30:18,625
Man, where we celebrated graduation.

438
00:30:22,333 --> 00:30:24,666
Think about your first evening with Marie.

439
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,166
Marie will never know.

440
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,166
You're right.

441
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:48,750
-I'll come.
-Yeah, you'll come.

442
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:52,000
-To the door. Not inside.
-No, no, no.

443
00:30:52,541 --> 00:30:54,458
Very sensible. But in a bad way.

444
00:30:54,541 --> 00:30:58,250
But in an emergency,
Baumi will smoke horse droppings. Deal.

445
00:31:00,791 --> 00:31:03,375
You've smoked horse droppings?

446
00:31:03,708 --> 00:31:06,458
No, that's just a saying. So, nonsense...

447
00:31:07,208 --> 00:31:09,583
In an emergency, you say these things...

448
00:31:10,166 --> 00:31:14,125
So depending
on what the animals have eaten,

449
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:18,125
that can also be very exciting.
I don't know.

450
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:19,958
I've smoked a lot in my life.

451
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,666
Shit.

452
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,916
-You gave him the car key?
-You told me to.

453
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,583
His keys! The toy ones, man!

454
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:38,916
What is he going to do with the car key?
Ben, Dad is here. Bite on it, Ben.

455
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,708
Take another bite, Ben.

456
00:31:40,791 --> 00:31:42,708
Bite the key.

457
00:31:45,208 --> 00:31:47,041
-Yes, exactly.
-Bite.

458
00:31:47,125 --> 00:31:49,083
-Come on. Come on. Bite.
-Bite.

459
00:31:49,166 --> 00:31:51,458
Yes, bite.

460
00:31:54,166 --> 00:31:55,250
Sorry.

461
00:31:56,916 --> 00:31:58,583
Come on, come on.

462
00:32:00,666 --> 00:32:03,041
Hey, they're trying to break into the car.

463
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:04,750
Fourth time this week.

464
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:10,458
Ben, come on, you can do it.

465
00:32:17,458 --> 00:32:19,500
Ben, Ben, Ben. Don't cry. Don't cry.

466
00:32:20,916 --> 00:32:23,416
We're playing a game.

467
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:25,375
Where is Baumi?

468
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:28,625
There's Baumi.

469
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,416
Ben.

470
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:45,541
Yeah, come on.

471
00:32:52,583 --> 00:32:55,125
Ben. I'm coming.

472
00:32:56,583 --> 00:32:58,000
Come here.

473
00:32:58,541 --> 00:33:01,041
Hey, Ben, give Papa the keys.

474
00:33:06,041 --> 00:33:08,166
Ben, give Papa the...

475
00:33:18,416 --> 00:33:19,875
The grill tongs.

476
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:22,333
I love you, Marie.

477
00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:35,250
Yes.

478
00:33:35,708 --> 00:33:38,083
Hey, Papa will get you out.

479
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:48,291
We're in.

480
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,791
RESIDENTS ONLY

481
00:34:05,625 --> 00:34:09,208
Yeah, what an adventure, right?

482
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:12,041
Okay, but come on now.

483
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:15,375
Excuse me? No way. That was a sign.

484
00:34:16,416 --> 00:34:18,666
Why? The little guy is fine.

485
00:34:19,416 --> 00:34:21,250
Hey, what kind of dad are you?

486
00:34:22,291 --> 00:34:24,250
The one with a broken car, Baumi.

487
00:34:25,666 --> 00:34:29,333
Hey, aren't you Noah?

488
00:34:29,791 --> 00:34:31,083
Wolle's assistant?

489
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:34,875
-Yes.
-What are you doing here?

490
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:36,708
We're going to the Tube.

491
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:37,875
With a baby.

492
00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:40,250
Nice.

493
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:44,250
Then, see you inside. I'd really
like to chat with you anyways.

494
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:47,208
Okay, cool.

495
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,166
See you later.

496
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:55,500
That was a sign.

497
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,416
Tibo.

498
00:35:06,166 --> 00:35:08,333
NEW SMS FROM SARAH
I WILL FIND YOU!

499
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:11,458
Forget it.

500
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,208
I hate it when I'm right.

501
00:35:22,375 --> 00:35:24,333
Yeah, drive, come on.

502
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,166
Jerk.

503
00:35:28,416 --> 00:35:30,291
Thanks for taking me there.

504
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:34,083
I'm too old for these parties.
You were the only interesting person.

505
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:38,958
The bar wasn't that high, right?
Why do you live there anyway?

506
00:35:39,041 --> 00:35:43,041
Divorced for nine months. Trying to
figure out what I'm supposed to do

507
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:46,500
-on a Saturday night.
-Blessed are the childless.

508
00:35:50,208 --> 00:35:53,958
-Or do you have some?
-We decided against it.

509
00:35:58,291 --> 00:36:01,625
-But you have two.
-Yes. Klara and Henri.

510
00:36:02,375 --> 00:36:04,000
What are you doing?

511
00:36:04,791 --> 00:36:07,208
And what is your name?

512
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:12,208
Sarah. Sarah. I'm Sarah.

513
00:36:14,458 --> 00:36:19,041
-Maybe one should start with that, right?
-As long as you don't end with that.

514
00:36:31,625 --> 00:36:32,916
Oh, no.

515
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,416
-What is it?
-Marie's breast milk.

516
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:40,125
-Dude.
-Shit.

517
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:42,916
It doesn't help that we know Ralf.

518
00:36:45,291 --> 00:36:47,333
Hey, careful. That's liquid gold.

519
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:49,291
Trust me.

520
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:52,625
A bottle still fits
between the belt and my belly.

521
00:36:53,666 --> 00:36:55,166
You can keep it.

522
00:36:59,416 --> 00:37:02,125
-What is that?
-Breast milk.

523
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,416
-For the baby?
-Trash.

524
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:12,166
If the little one screams and people
complain, then it's your problem, okay?

525
00:37:17,041 --> 00:37:19,791
-Is that a real baby?
-What else?

526
00:37:19,875 --> 00:37:21,916
No entry without teeth.

527
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,916
Wait a second. We know Ralf.

528
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,458
Just one song. I just want to
show him my club before it's gone.

529
00:37:27,541 --> 00:37:31,250
I don't care. Ralf can thank me.
We don't need any lawsuits.

530
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:34,416
-What?
-I study law.

531
00:37:40,583 --> 00:37:42,250
Come on, piss off. Go on, boy.

532
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:56,541
You just have to know
how to deactivate the fire alarm.

533
00:37:56,625 --> 00:37:59,666
-The door isn't linked to the fire alarm.
-Whatever.

534
00:38:45,166 --> 00:38:46,583
Do you smell that?

535
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:49,791
That's the smell of happiness.

536
00:39:30,666 --> 00:39:32,625
Where's our area?

537
00:39:32,708 --> 00:39:37,458
Yeah, I wanted to tell you. Unfortunately,
the VIP area didn't work out.

538
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:42,625
But there's hardly anything going on here
compared to downstairs, right?

539
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:45,208
It's okay. I'm just staying for one song.

540
00:39:51,375 --> 00:39:55,041
Come on, go, it's enough that someone
has to stay up here.

541
00:39:59,833 --> 00:40:01,208
Thanks, Dad.

542
00:40:03,458 --> 00:40:06,208
Just like Baumi,
I used to go out here, too.

543
00:40:08,083 --> 00:40:10,666
Just look.

544
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:50,541
Yeah, great.

545
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,416
Hey.

546
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:01,750
Klara?

547
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,333
Klara?

548
00:41:03,458 --> 00:41:07,333
-What are you doing here?
-Chill. Henri's at a friend's house.

549
00:41:07,416 --> 00:41:09,250
Does Sarah know you're here?

550
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:11,791
Don't uncle me. She's looking for you.

551
00:41:11,875 --> 00:41:14,708
I'm guessing because of Ben.

552
00:41:14,791 --> 00:41:18,875
-Who is this guy?
-TJ. We know each other from Insta.

553
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:20,875
From Instagram. It's fine.

554
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:23,333
What's up with you? You sound like Mom.

555
00:41:23,416 --> 00:41:27,041
-Don't do anything you'll regret later.
-Man, this is my life.

556
00:41:31,583 --> 00:41:33,750
-Who's this guy?
-My ex.

557
00:41:34,833 --> 00:41:36,125
Can't get over me.

558
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,208
-Shit, my mom.
-Shit, your mom.

559
00:41:45,541 --> 00:41:47,875
Klara...

560
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,833
Klara.

561
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:55,750
Klara.

562
00:41:56,041 --> 00:41:58,750
-Are you a VIP or something?
-Why?

563
00:41:59,208 --> 00:42:00,708
They let us in so easy.

564
00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:03,166
No, I'm a firefighter.

565
00:42:04,375 --> 00:42:07,083
We're here a lot
for fire safety and all that.

566
00:42:07,875 --> 00:42:10,125
-Firefighter?
-Yes.

567
00:42:16,291 --> 00:42:17,916
Did you hear that?

568
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,416
No.

569
00:42:28,291 --> 00:42:29,708
Klara.

570
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,250
Baumi. Baumi.

571
00:42:34,125 --> 00:42:35,291
Hey.

572
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:36,333
-Come.
-What?

573
00:42:36,416 --> 00:42:38,958
I need to go now.
Come on. Sarah is here.

574
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,833
Shit. Caretaker alert.

575
00:42:47,625 --> 00:42:49,041
What are you doing?

576
00:42:54,708 --> 00:42:58,375
-Don't you work with kids?
-Just because I can dance good?

577
00:42:58,916 --> 00:43:00,875
Hey.

578
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,416
I'll find you, Noah.

579
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,250
Look. She's stalking me. For no reason.

580
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:09,333
Well, what kind of father
takes his baby to a concert?

581
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:15,000
-You're not calling Marie, are you?
-No. Klara. Answer!

582
00:43:15,083 --> 00:43:17,416
It kinda smells like stress right now.

583
00:43:17,833 --> 00:43:21,333
Stress. Baumi,
you have no idea what stress is.

584
00:43:21,416 --> 00:43:25,166
Sarah hates herself and her life
and is happy when I am miserable.

585
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:27,791
If she catches us,
she'll tell Marie everything

586
00:43:27,875 --> 00:43:31,166
-and then Sarah is Ben's new dad.
-But without balls.

587
00:43:42,083 --> 00:43:44,666
Sorry that I had to get out of there.

588
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:48,083
That was a lame party anyway.
Are you up for a real one?

589
00:43:49,208 --> 00:43:50,625
Yeah, sure.

590
00:43:52,166 --> 00:43:54,375
Klara, stop acting like me.

591
00:43:57,416 --> 00:44:00,541
Dude, someone smashed your window
and stole your car.

592
00:44:03,791 --> 00:44:04,833
Are you...

593
00:44:09,291 --> 00:44:10,708
Thanks.

594
00:44:17,375 --> 00:44:18,791
Thank you.

595
00:44:45,666 --> 00:44:48,333
So, when you're up here,
you have to dance, too.

596
00:44:55,708 --> 00:44:59,625
You can also look around
while you dance. See?

597
00:45:06,041 --> 00:45:09,583
-Have you been here before?
-Yeah, but it's been a long time.

598
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:11,916
Early '00s or so.

599
00:45:12,791 --> 00:45:15,458
How did I not talk to you then?

600
00:45:18,625 --> 00:45:21,750
I can't say for sure. It was a wild time.

601
00:45:24,416 --> 00:45:25,708
"Was"?

602
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,416
Noah?

603
00:45:39,375 --> 00:45:41,416
Everything's okay. Nothing happened.

604
00:45:43,291 --> 00:45:44,666
I'm fine.

605
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:57,000
Really? The thieves were
watched and reported? Great.

606
00:45:57,125 --> 00:45:58,916
All right, thank you very much.

607
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,500
Hey, I can't get a hold of Paul and Mimi.
If they're partying, they are way out.

608
00:46:03,583 --> 00:46:06,250
Hey, now they're taking drugs. Look.

609
00:46:06,958 --> 00:46:09,791
I know him. He's a student of mine.

610
00:46:09,875 --> 00:46:11,583
-What?
-Tobias Jencke.

611
00:46:11,666 --> 00:46:15,083
Calls himself TJ. He's...

612
00:46:16,208 --> 00:46:17,958
-What?
-Hard to say.

613
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:20,458
He's in the Champion's League drug-wise.

614
00:46:20,958 --> 00:46:23,291
I get my LSD from him. Super-fresh.

615
00:46:26,875 --> 00:46:29,375
It could be that he has
some damage up top.

616
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:34,375
Hey, yeah, you're getting hungry,
aren't you?

617
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:35,833
Give me the milk.

618
00:46:39,708 --> 00:46:41,041
Yeah...

619
00:46:48,708 --> 00:46:50,083
What's this?

620
00:46:50,875 --> 00:46:51,875
Breast milk.

621
00:46:53,333 --> 00:46:54,750
Where's the rest?

622
00:46:56,791 --> 00:46:58,500
-Broken.
-What?

623
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,166
Broken.

624
00:47:02,875 --> 00:47:07,250
-Then should we head home?
-I brought all of them with us, Baumi.

625
00:47:07,333 --> 00:47:10,458
-Okay, then. Minimart? They've got them.
-Minimart?

626
00:47:10,541 --> 00:47:15,416
Breast milk! Because he doesn't
get anything else. No kebabs.

627
00:47:22,291 --> 00:47:26,000
-What are you doing?
-Looking for the last bottle of milk.

628
00:47:37,666 --> 00:47:41,708
Hey, relax. I also give first aid courses.

629
00:47:51,208 --> 00:47:52,625
Who is Gregor?

630
00:48:00,416 --> 00:48:02,291
You write stories in ink, huh?

631
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,208
Left nothing but scars. End of story.

632
00:48:17,208 --> 00:48:18,458
Does it hurt a lot?

633
00:48:20,166 --> 00:48:21,583
It's okay.

634
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,208
I'll fix it up faster than
you can say "ouch."

635
00:48:25,291 --> 00:48:26,708
Trust me.

636
00:48:28,291 --> 00:48:29,708
But I barely know you.

637
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,500
Then I'll confess something to you.

638
00:48:36,333 --> 00:48:37,750
I lied earlier.

639
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:40,125
My wife

640
00:48:40,916 --> 00:48:42,333
didn't want children.

641
00:48:46,208 --> 00:48:47,750
That's what broke us up.

642
00:48:49,583 --> 00:48:51,000
I'm sorry...

643
00:48:51,875 --> 00:48:54,750
See? Faster than you can say "ouch."

644
00:49:04,625 --> 00:49:06,166
Look here.

645
00:49:06,291 --> 00:49:09,750
That's the bottle they took away
from the people in front of us.

646
00:49:09,833 --> 00:49:11,333
The bag's got to be in there.

647
00:49:23,125 --> 00:49:25,333
Hello. Dad will be back soon.

648
00:49:25,416 --> 00:49:27,333
Reminder, Ben is a baby.

649
00:49:27,416 --> 00:49:31,000
He doesn't want to get thrown,
take selfies, or learn to walk.

650
00:49:31,083 --> 00:49:33,916
That's your opinion. But okay.

651
00:49:44,666 --> 00:49:45,666
Hey!

652
00:49:47,083 --> 00:49:48,500
Hey, you pisser!

653
00:49:53,458 --> 00:49:57,708
-The cat, Mimi.
-Damn pisser, that's my container.

654
00:49:57,791 --> 00:50:01,666
Sorry. I'll leave all your drugs in it,
I just need one thing.

655
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:06,375
Do I look like a fucking junkie?
I've been clean for over three weeks.

656
00:50:07,041 --> 00:50:09,958
I'm not saying people
accept this automatically...

657
00:50:10,416 --> 00:50:13,708
-But that you automatically assumed...
-Excuse me.

658
00:50:13,791 --> 00:50:16,000
Now, let me think about it again.

659
00:50:16,083 --> 00:50:18,791
About the drugs.
Only because he started it. Yeah.

660
00:50:18,875 --> 00:50:22,666
-Yeah, that was shitty, Noah.
-Yeah, really shitty. Thanks.

661
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:24,666
A real setback.

662
00:50:26,166 --> 00:50:29,625
You can take everything you want
out of the bin right away.

663
00:50:29,708 --> 00:50:31,333
I just need my breast milk.

664
00:50:34,291 --> 00:50:35,666
There's milk in there?

665
00:50:37,666 --> 00:50:39,208
Breast milk.

666
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:42,666
Did you hear, Hasselhoff?

667
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:44,958
Today, there's milk.

668
00:50:58,166 --> 00:50:59,833
Oh, God.

669
00:51:02,625 --> 00:51:05,708
-Forget it. It's for my baby.
-Hasselhoff is my baby.

670
00:51:05,791 --> 00:51:09,375
Do you know how long it's been
since he had fresh milk?

671
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:16,208
Your baby that's fat
and plump and rosy?

672
00:51:16,291 --> 00:51:18,625
I know you can't even see his ribs.

673
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:36,000
Baumi! Baumi!

674
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:43,625
Tell me, are you completely crazy or what?

675
00:51:46,625 --> 00:51:48,166
This is all just a game.

676
00:52:02,041 --> 00:52:03,458
Baumi!

677
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,666
Wait.

678
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:12,958
-Marie.
-Hey.

679
00:52:13,083 --> 00:52:15,125
-Yeah.
-Last call, promise.

680
00:52:15,208 --> 00:52:18,833
-Is everything okay with Noah?
-Yeah, great. Don't worry.

681
00:52:19,208 --> 00:52:21,666
Everything is fine here.

682
00:52:22,166 --> 00:52:24,583
-We chat tomorrow, okay?
-Yeah, okay.

683
00:52:24,666 --> 00:52:26,375
-Bye.
-Okay, bye.

684
00:52:33,208 --> 00:52:34,625
I...

685
00:52:37,291 --> 00:52:38,708
I've got to find Noah.

686
00:52:43,458 --> 00:52:44,833
COMMERCIAL WASTE

687
00:52:44,916 --> 00:52:47,500
-Baumi!
-Hey.

688
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,500
-Baumi.
-Hey.

689
00:53:03,125 --> 00:53:04,333
Yeah.

690
00:53:05,583 --> 00:53:08,666
Hey. You're a good father.

691
00:53:09,708 --> 00:53:13,583
My father, he wouldn't
have fought so hard for me.

692
00:53:38,458 --> 00:53:39,666
Marie.

693
00:53:45,916 --> 00:53:48,083
I can't believe it. I missed them.

694
00:53:48,166 --> 00:53:49,833
Now where do you want to go?

695
00:53:49,958 --> 00:53:52,458
No idea. I've got to find my nephew, okay?

696
00:53:52,541 --> 00:53:54,583
And you are...

697
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:58,208
-A distraction.
-A pleasant one?

698
00:54:01,583 --> 00:54:03,000
I hope.

699
00:54:07,916 --> 00:54:10,916
-But Ben is more important.
-I can't do this, okay?

700
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,291
I'm a mother. I have responsibilities.
I can't simply turn that off.

701
00:54:15,375 --> 00:54:19,125
-Why not?
-Asks the guy without kids.

702
00:54:25,833 --> 00:54:27,250
Well, then...

703
00:54:36,291 --> 00:54:37,708
I wish you luck.

704
00:54:51,541 --> 00:54:53,125
They lock that stuff up?

705
00:54:53,208 --> 00:54:56,000
-Looks expensive.
-Definitely for me.

706
00:54:56,916 --> 00:54:59,958
Can someone unlock this here, please?

707
00:55:02,041 --> 00:55:03,458
-Good evening.
-Hello.

708
00:55:07,375 --> 00:55:10,791
-Formula or alcohol?
-Best if it could be baby alcohol.

709
00:55:12,166 --> 00:55:13,583
Formula, please.

710
00:55:17,833 --> 00:55:20,458
-You'll eat soon.
-Anything else?

711
00:55:20,541 --> 00:55:25,916
Yeah, we also need some hot water.

712
00:55:26,541 --> 00:55:28,291
That's your kid, right?

713
00:55:28,833 --> 00:55:30,833
His kid. I still have a life.

714
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:38,875
-You still have a life?
-Yes, I'm not saying I won't find a wife.

715
00:55:39,541 --> 00:55:40,958
Why?

716
00:55:43,541 --> 00:55:44,958
Thanks.

717
00:55:45,583 --> 00:55:49,041
-Three spoonfuls of powder, shake, done.
-Got it.

718
00:55:49,125 --> 00:55:53,041
-That's €37.98.
-Yes.

719
00:56:01,125 --> 00:56:04,083
What is it? We'll have it soon.

720
00:56:04,166 --> 00:56:06,708
Shit. Have you seen my wallet?
It was here.

721
00:56:06,791 --> 00:56:09,208
Hey, no... It's not in there.

722
00:56:09,291 --> 00:56:11,291
-Do you have money?
-No.

723
00:56:11,375 --> 00:56:15,250
-Why didn't you bring any money?
-I thought you're inviting me.

724
00:56:15,333 --> 00:56:20,708
-Do you have Apple Pay?
-No, but we have formula, for €37.98.

725
00:56:21,375 --> 00:56:22,833
-Collateral?
-Yes.

726
00:56:22,916 --> 00:56:28,000
My watch? Look, it's my
girlfriend's engagement present.

727
00:56:28,083 --> 00:56:30,083
Maybe even...

728
00:56:33,416 --> 00:56:35,541
You must be a mother too, Ms...

729
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:40,125
Yildiz. Yes, and my son was in bed by now.

730
00:56:40,416 --> 00:56:41,875
Especially as a baby.

731
00:56:41,958 --> 00:56:45,666
Yes, and that's exactly
where mine should be. In his bed.

732
00:56:46,708 --> 00:56:49,083
As fathers, we have to...
Sorry, as parents,

733
00:56:49,166 --> 00:56:51,125
we have to stick together, Ms. Yemaz.

734
00:56:51,208 --> 00:56:53,916
-Yildiz.
-Yildiz? Ms. Yildiz.

735
00:57:15,291 --> 00:57:17,208
Don't do it, boy.

736
00:57:17,875 --> 00:57:20,375
-What?
-We have a lot of experience here

737
00:57:20,458 --> 00:57:22,250
with that sort of thing.

738
00:57:22,333 --> 00:57:24,125
What? What does she mean?

739
00:57:25,583 --> 00:57:26,958
-Hey.
-Baumi!

740
00:57:27,041 --> 00:57:28,458
Hey!

741
00:57:36,958 --> 00:57:39,333
Naci. Naci.

742
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:46,541
-What?
-Learn Turkish, boy. Thieves.

743
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,708
-You can't be serious?
-The punishment is the same.

744
00:57:56,250 --> 00:57:57,458
Do you hear that?

745
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,250
Now I will scare you.

746
00:58:18,291 --> 00:58:19,458
Are you crazy or what?

747
00:58:21,791 --> 00:58:23,791
We have a baby here, you idiot!

748
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:45,041
I haven't run like this
since the national youth games.

749
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,250
Okay, okay. Come on.

750
00:59:00,458 --> 00:59:01,791
Come on.

751
00:59:26,416 --> 00:59:28,625
Because of you, I'm eating garbage, Noah.

752
00:59:29,875 --> 00:59:32,000
Here. There, there. There, there.

753
00:59:35,125 --> 00:59:39,333
Yes, I know... Look.
Now there's something to eat, huh?

754
00:59:39,416 --> 00:59:40,833
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

755
00:59:41,291 --> 00:59:42,708
Yeah.

756
00:59:43,416 --> 00:59:47,083
Yeah, something's coming soon.

757
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:56,333
Sorry.

758
00:59:59,708 --> 01:00:01,125
Can you?

759
01:00:06,708 --> 01:00:08,083
Is it too hot?

760
01:00:09,041 --> 01:00:13,916
No, it's good. Tell me.
Did you step in shit?

761
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,250
-What?
-Did you step in shit?

762
01:00:22,666 --> 01:00:24,083
Yes.

763
01:00:24,166 --> 01:00:27,166
I need a changing mat, wet wipes
and a diaper.

764
01:00:32,375 --> 01:00:34,083
Did you just smell his butt?

765
01:00:34,625 --> 01:00:36,916
-What?
-Did you just smell his butt?

766
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:41,083
It's a baby. They poop.

767
01:00:41,166 --> 01:00:44,708
Besides, he only drinks breast milk.
It doesn't stink.

768
01:00:44,791 --> 01:00:47,833
You put your nose in poop voluntarily.

769
01:00:47,916 --> 01:00:49,333
That's not right.

770
01:00:51,958 --> 01:00:55,250
You have to stop that.
At least in front of me.

771
01:00:56,375 --> 01:00:59,583
Yes, I know. What a night, huh?
We need to head home.

772
01:00:59,666 --> 01:01:02,166
What about your drugged niece?

773
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:04,791
Ben's more important.
He needs to go to bed.

774
01:01:04,875 --> 01:01:06,625
Okay. I'll call a taxi.

775
01:01:16,458 --> 01:01:21,583
Asshole. Just tonight, Sarah. Because you
need the sugar. Otherwise you get tired.

776
01:01:23,708 --> 01:01:25,000
That's so good.

777
01:01:27,291 --> 01:01:28,916
You will pay for that.

778
01:01:39,208 --> 01:01:40,583
Bad news.

779
01:01:40,666 --> 01:01:44,166
I can only find taxis with child seats,
not baby seats.

780
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:48,333
It's obvious. At this time,
babies shouldn't be out and about.

781
01:01:50,208 --> 01:01:52,750
Hey. What are you doing with the baby?

782
01:01:54,875 --> 01:01:57,041
-Holm, call the cops.
-Yo.

783
01:01:57,125 --> 01:01:59,375
Elvis, grab it.

784
01:01:59,458 --> 01:02:02,083
Guys, this is a misunderstanding.
This is my son.

785
01:02:02,166 --> 01:02:04,375
This isn't what it looks like.

786
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:06,375
What does this look like?

787
01:02:06,708 --> 01:02:10,416
The little one is fine.
I think he just doesn't want the milk.

788
01:02:11,125 --> 01:02:13,291
Baby milk?

789
01:02:13,375 --> 01:02:15,958
-How old is the little guy?
-Twenty weeks.

790
01:02:19,041 --> 01:02:20,458
Let them go.

791
01:02:23,708 --> 01:02:25,541
That really is his child.

792
01:02:25,625 --> 01:02:28,500
Otherwise he wouldn't have
answered in weeks.

793
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:32,708
Have you already given him Sab Simplex?

794
01:02:32,791 --> 01:02:34,875
-Sab what?
-Sab Simplex.

795
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:38,083
Or fennel tea?

796
01:02:38,166 --> 01:02:40,666
Hey, maybe he's just teething.

797
01:02:41,125 --> 01:02:44,625
When my daughter was in this phase,
I almost went nuts.

798
01:02:45,916 --> 01:02:48,958
Put a small washcloth
in the freezer for him

799
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:51,958
so he can chew on it.

800
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:54,625
Okay.

801
01:02:54,708 --> 01:02:57,458
I will. Thank you.

802
01:02:58,291 --> 01:02:59,625
Give him to me a second.

803
01:03:01,708 --> 01:03:03,083
What?

804
01:03:03,208 --> 01:03:05,958
-Give him the baby.
-I can't give him my baby.

805
01:03:06,041 --> 01:03:08,916
-Give him the baby.
-I don't even know this guy.

806
01:03:09,041 --> 01:03:12,500
-He's a stranger.
-I have four small, wonderful children.

807
01:03:12,583 --> 01:03:14,500
I know how to calm them, okay?

808
01:03:27,916 --> 01:03:30,625
-Hey, but, please...
-I just want to burp him.

809
01:03:31,458 --> 01:03:32,875
I just did.

810
01:03:39,791 --> 01:03:42,333
I've got you, baby. I've got you.

811
01:03:53,875 --> 01:03:56,208
Boss, you're so good at it.

812
01:03:59,166 --> 01:04:01,416
It was the same with my third one.

813
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:04,416
Always needed a second burp
ten minutes after drinking.

814
01:04:05,833 --> 01:04:07,250
Thanks.

815
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:12,583
Kurt. But my friends call me Fist.

816
01:04:15,166 --> 01:04:17,583
Look. So happy.

817
01:04:17,666 --> 01:04:21,041
I didn't know what to do
with my first one, either.

818
01:04:21,125 --> 01:04:24,291
Only with the second,
it started to feel right.

819
01:04:24,375 --> 01:04:25,875
Then it came together.

820
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:32,583
Today, the only thing
I'm unbeatable at is babies.

821
01:04:32,666 --> 01:04:36,458
-And reinforced concrete.
-Yeah, reinforced concrete.

822
01:04:36,541 --> 01:04:37,708
It's an art.

823
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:40,833
-You either have it or you don't, right?
-Yes, right.

824
01:04:41,708 --> 01:04:43,500
-Thanks.
-Pleasure.

825
01:04:44,416 --> 01:04:45,833
Really. Thank you.

826
01:04:51,041 --> 01:04:52,708
Oh, crap. I totally forgot.

827
01:04:55,875 --> 01:04:57,291
Hands up.

828
01:05:01,666 --> 01:05:03,083
Baby down.

829
01:05:10,958 --> 01:05:13,541
He forgot this. Amateurs.

830
01:05:14,916 --> 01:05:17,333
-Baumi, you said, was one's name?
-Yes.

831
01:05:17,416 --> 01:05:18,958
Naci will find them.

832
01:05:19,041 --> 01:05:21,208
You should leave that to us instead.

833
01:05:21,291 --> 01:05:26,000
Suspicious men on the loose.
Two confused-looking guys with a baby.

834
01:05:27,208 --> 01:05:30,208
Got it. I'm on my way. Have a good night.

835
01:05:31,125 --> 01:05:32,458
Nice watch.

836
01:05:35,875 --> 01:05:39,541
So now again from the beginning.
Why did you steal the car?

837
01:05:39,625 --> 01:05:43,291
We didn't steal a car. Mine was stolen.
I reported it.

838
01:05:43,416 --> 01:05:45,208
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

839
01:05:45,291 --> 01:05:47,500
CAR THEFT

840
01:05:47,583 --> 01:05:50,958
-We live in a surveillance state.
-A resident took the photo.

841
01:05:51,041 --> 01:05:54,958
That's my car.
Black Audi, license number PW1036.

842
01:05:55,041 --> 01:05:57,500
It has a sticker which says "Noah's Ark."

843
01:05:57,583 --> 01:06:00,125
You have a photo of me
breaking into my car.

844
01:06:00,208 --> 01:06:03,250
-Why would you do that?
-I locked my baby inside.

845
01:06:05,833 --> 01:06:08,041
I accidentally locked my baby inside.

846
01:06:08,916 --> 01:06:13,291
-And why is your baby out so late?
-What does that mean? It's my baby. Ben.

847
01:06:13,416 --> 01:06:16,333
-Or is it just a prop?
-What?

848
01:06:16,416 --> 01:06:20,583
You distract salespeople with a baby so
your junkie boyfriend can get the stuff.

849
01:06:20,666 --> 01:06:23,791
-Junkie friend?
-The stolen powder says it all.

850
01:06:23,875 --> 01:06:26,416
Do you use it to stretch
the coke or heroin?

851
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,625
Nothing gets stolen by guys like you
like baby milk powder.

852
01:06:30,708 --> 01:06:32,666
That's why the locked case.

853
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:36,208
I wanted to... I had to feed my baby.

854
01:06:36,291 --> 01:06:38,791
We only needed milk! Only milk!

855
01:06:38,875 --> 01:06:40,625
And he stole chocolate bars?

856
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:45,250
Maybe you want to answer that question?

857
01:06:45,333 --> 01:06:47,750
The punishment is the same, isn't it?

858
01:06:48,041 --> 01:06:52,750
I should have stayed home. I just wanted
to drive my baby around to fall asleep.

859
01:06:52,833 --> 01:06:57,416
And then he called... Takes me to...
And then I lock my baby in the car

860
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:59,375
and then he lost the milk.

861
01:07:00,041 --> 01:07:03,166
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
I made a mistake and I am...

862
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:04,625
Noah Wittmann!

863
01:07:08,666 --> 01:07:12,125
Sarah Kofler. His sister-in-law.
And lawyer.

864
01:07:12,708 --> 01:07:17,000
You can't choose your brother-in-law,
can you? But he's not a car thief.

865
01:07:17,083 --> 01:07:18,500
And I'm not a junkie.

866
01:07:19,625 --> 01:07:24,208
Well, I cleared up the misunderstanding
at the minimart and settled the bill.

867
01:07:24,291 --> 01:07:25,708
Here,

868
01:07:26,541 --> 01:07:27,958
your watch.

869
01:07:41,875 --> 01:07:43,416
Who do we have there?

870
01:07:44,041 --> 01:07:45,708
Is that Dr. Raupi?

871
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:49,125
Hello, hello.
Aunt Sarah will take you to safety now.

872
01:07:49,208 --> 01:07:52,083
-Hey. Then I'd say...
-Shut up, Baumi.

873
01:07:54,375 --> 01:07:56,291
I'm bringing the little one home,

874
01:07:56,375 --> 01:08:00,625
and what you two do, I couldn't care less.

875
01:08:00,708 --> 01:08:02,666
-Sarah, I can explain.
-Save it, Noah.

876
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:08,666
I'm only here for Marie.
Besides, I'll soon be on parental leave.

877
01:08:08,791 --> 01:08:13,875
So awesome, and I was already thinking,
man, it has... Hey. Congratulations.

878
01:08:15,041 --> 01:08:17,125
How long did you last at home?

879
01:08:17,958 --> 01:08:20,625
Ten minutes? Five?

880
01:08:20,708 --> 01:08:26,041
Do you understand now that Marie needs me?
You are such a failure, Noah.

881
01:08:26,125 --> 01:08:28,708
You wouldn't even notice
if he fell off the table.

882
01:08:28,791 --> 01:08:33,000
Hey, and you don't even notice
if your daughter is secretly partying.

883
01:08:33,083 --> 01:08:34,208
What?

884
01:08:36,458 --> 01:08:38,125
Nothing. Everything is fine.

885
01:08:38,208 --> 01:08:40,958
Very harmless. Klara is at a teen party.

886
01:08:41,041 --> 01:08:45,166
Fine? I would never let my daughter
hang out with TJ. Don't worry.

887
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:47,458
"Don't worry"?

888
01:08:47,916 --> 01:08:50,583
-Where is she?
-At the culture depot.

889
01:08:51,625 --> 01:08:56,208
Sarah, take Ben home
and Baumi and I will pick up Klara.

890
01:08:56,291 --> 01:08:58,208
I'll pick up my daughter!

891
01:09:23,041 --> 01:09:24,625
Do you want something?

892
01:09:26,291 --> 01:09:27,583
For tripping?

893
01:09:28,666 --> 01:09:30,083
Sure.

894
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:41,708
Is that it now?

895
01:09:43,625 --> 01:09:46,333
-Evil wins?
-You heard what she said.

896
01:09:47,708 --> 01:09:49,125
She's not exactly wrong.

897
01:09:50,041 --> 01:09:51,458
Bullshit.

898
01:09:53,833 --> 01:09:56,208
You're just crawling away like a snake.

899
01:09:56,916 --> 01:09:58,958
It's my discipline, not yours.

900
01:10:17,291 --> 01:10:19,625
And just for the record, okay...

901
01:10:21,375 --> 01:10:23,708
I think it's great that you're a dad.

902
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:29,708
You know, that gives me courage.

903
01:10:29,791 --> 01:10:31,458
I mean, if you can do it...

904
01:10:33,458 --> 01:10:36,291
then maybe I can do it one day.

905
01:10:38,625 --> 01:10:41,666
A good father would have
stayed home with his baby.

906
01:10:44,583 --> 01:10:46,166
I'm an idiot.

907
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:48,791
But it's still better than being an ass.

908
01:10:52,083 --> 01:10:56,541
You know, assholes... They quit.

909
01:10:58,500 --> 01:10:59,916
They leave.

910
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,583
But you aren't an asshole.

911
01:11:05,625 --> 01:11:07,583
Hey, you're one of the good guys.

912
01:11:11,625 --> 01:11:13,333
You have your own massive...

913
01:11:14,583 --> 01:11:18,208
protective shield of love
when you have Ben in your arms.

914
01:11:19,916 --> 01:11:23,166
And that needs to lift you up now.

915
01:11:37,208 --> 01:11:38,458
Yes, man.

916
01:11:49,791 --> 01:11:51,541
Are you shitting me?

917
01:11:57,833 --> 01:12:00,000
Hey. Is that...

918
01:12:02,083 --> 01:12:06,958
A magic rainbow.
Hey, if she only ate one of them whole...

919
01:12:09,708 --> 01:12:12,500
-Ben.
-Shit.

920
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:36,916
Well, wild night, right, Benny?

921
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,666
Now let's pick up your cousin
from a party.

922
01:12:46,625 --> 01:12:49,833
Should the old aunt go for it again?
What do you think?

923
01:12:50,708 --> 01:12:53,291
Shake the dance floor a little?

924
01:12:54,291 --> 01:12:56,458
Unpack a few of my old moves?

925
01:12:56,541 --> 01:12:59,375
Should we? You don't believe me?

926
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:01,166
I'll show you, baby.

927
01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:03,916
I was the star of every party,
I'm telling you.

928
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,750
I have the best moves. The best moves.
And Sarah is back.

929
01:13:07,833 --> 01:13:09,625
No hands.

930
01:13:31,666 --> 01:13:34,916
All right, guys? Your journey ends here.

931
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,208
What do you want, asswipe?

932
01:13:37,291 --> 01:13:40,125
We cleared everything.
I don't have time for stress.

933
01:13:40,208 --> 01:13:44,125
My son has been kidnapped by his aunt
who is as high as Snoop Dogg.

934
01:13:44,208 --> 01:13:47,750
If we need to fight, I'll ram you
and your piss bowl into the ground.

935
01:13:47,833 --> 01:13:51,125
Moron. You want to mess with me?

936
01:13:51,375 --> 01:13:55,375
I don't just look like King Kong.
I am King Kong.

937
01:13:57,916 --> 01:14:00,041
Wait. One second.

938
01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:10,666
That's my song. That's my idea.

939
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:13,583
Tibo. My idea. He used my idea.

940
01:14:13,666 --> 01:14:14,666
-Yes!
-No!

941
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:16,333
Yeah!

942
01:14:17,083 --> 01:14:18,500
Hey!

943
01:14:20,541 --> 01:14:21,958
You know Tibo?

944
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,666
Yes, of course he knows Tibo.

945
01:14:25,208 --> 01:14:27,041
Tibo and Noah, they're...

946
01:14:28,791 --> 01:14:31,166
Somehow, you are slowly
getting my sympathy.

947
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:36,250
But this is not a piss bowl.

948
01:14:37,083 --> 01:14:38,583
Definitely not.

949
01:14:40,291 --> 01:14:41,583
How fast does it go?

950
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:49,708
Now watch out. Hold on to your tongues.

951
01:15:00,791 --> 01:15:02,416
-Mommy!
-Mommy!

952
01:15:20,625 --> 01:15:22,250
Here I am again.

953
01:15:25,041 --> 01:15:28,333
Well, you sweet little yummy, yummy baby.

954
01:15:30,875 --> 01:15:33,833
You smell so good.

955
01:15:38,416 --> 01:15:41,625
Come. Let's go have a look.
Let's go have a look.

956
01:16:04,958 --> 01:16:06,291
Klara?

957
01:16:08,833 --> 01:16:10,416
Klara!

958
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,208
Klara!

959
01:16:24,541 --> 01:16:25,958
Thanks, man.

960
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:32,458
Those aren't
the only possibilities in life, Naci.

961
01:16:34,625 --> 01:16:36,041
Thanks.

962
01:16:51,416 --> 01:16:53,583
Are we going to do something now?

963
01:16:54,541 --> 01:16:56,583
I have to let it go to work first.

964
01:16:57,875 --> 01:16:59,333
Don't you feel anything?

965
01:17:03,916 --> 01:17:06,583
Sorry. I'm a little scared
of losing control.

966
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:09,791
Klara!

967
01:17:11,458 --> 01:17:12,875
Klara!

968
01:17:26,833 --> 01:17:30,416
Hey, have you seen a woman with a baby?

969
01:17:30,916 --> 01:17:32,500
Horrible pickup line.

970
01:17:36,625 --> 01:17:38,041
Klara!

971
01:17:40,583 --> 01:17:41,708
Klara!

972
01:17:41,791 --> 01:17:43,500
What are you doing here?

973
01:17:44,666 --> 01:17:47,791
Well, what are you doing here?

974
01:17:47,875 --> 01:17:52,541
Having a little fun. Otherwise I'll end up
like you, a bitter bitch.

975
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:58,458
Listen, I know how this ends, yeah?
Because I was just like you.

976
01:17:58,541 --> 01:18:02,208
Just because you were out of control
doesn't mean I'm the same.

977
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:04,333
What's going on here, huh?

978
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,750
What's going on here?

979
01:18:08,833 --> 01:18:11,666
Mom, stop it.
This is embarrassing, stop it.

980
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:13,166
Stop it.

981
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:18,000
-Hey, maybe I can have some fun, too.
-What do you know about fun?

982
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:30,833
That's not funny.

983
01:18:31,375 --> 01:18:33,083
Yes, it is very funny.

984
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:39,000
Maybe it has to be like that, yeah?
Children should have fun.

985
01:18:43,208 --> 01:18:44,708
Hey, Benny, Benny, Benny.

986
01:18:46,291 --> 01:18:48,291
-Hey, come here.
-Mom, Mom, Mom.

987
01:18:48,375 --> 01:18:51,500
Okay. Give me Ben and let's go.

988
01:18:51,583 --> 01:18:52,500
-Yes...
-Yeah.

989
01:18:52,583 --> 01:18:53,791
-Yes.
-Yeah.

990
01:18:53,875 --> 01:18:54,875
Or...

991
01:18:57,541 --> 01:19:00,375
We're going to have a little party.

992
01:19:00,458 --> 01:19:03,500
-Give me Ben.
-I'm never allowed to go to parties.

993
01:19:03,583 --> 01:19:09,583
Four, three, two, one... Color.

994
01:19:44,416 --> 01:19:46,541
My firefighter.

995
01:19:55,125 --> 01:19:56,541
Mom?

996
01:19:57,375 --> 01:19:58,583
Mom!

997
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:07,250
One, two, three, color.

998
01:20:29,375 --> 01:20:30,791
Noah.

999
01:20:32,833 --> 01:20:34,291
-Klara.
-Noah.

1000
01:20:34,375 --> 01:20:35,750
-Noah.
-Klara.

1001
01:20:36,166 --> 01:20:37,458
Klara.

1002
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:39,291
-Baumi.
-Here.

1003
01:20:42,916 --> 01:20:45,500
-Have you seen your mom?
-Yes, totally lit.

1004
01:20:45,583 --> 01:20:47,666
-Yeah, I know, she has Ben.
-Yes, I know.

1005
01:20:48,583 --> 01:20:49,833
Yeah, I know. Come on.

1006
01:20:56,291 --> 01:21:00,958
Hey, have you seen a woman?
She looks like someone's mom. With a baby.

1007
01:21:01,041 --> 01:21:03,833
Yes, looked totally drunk.

1008
01:21:03,916 --> 01:21:05,375
Where?

1009
01:21:06,666 --> 01:21:08,083
-Hey.
-There.

1010
01:21:12,208 --> 01:21:13,625
Baumi!

1011
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Hey, did you hear that?

1012
01:21:32,666 --> 01:21:33,916
Up there.

1013
01:21:34,541 --> 01:21:37,458
Maybe I didn't show you enough
of what I wanted to.

1014
01:21:37,541 --> 01:21:40,916
-And I'll show you. Have a look.
-Sarah!

1015
01:21:42,791 --> 01:21:44,208
Mom!

1016
01:21:44,291 --> 01:21:47,166
Shit. She better not have Ben up there.

1017
01:21:49,041 --> 01:21:51,791
-Shit. Sarah!
-Noah, man.

1018
01:21:58,125 --> 01:21:59,541
Turn the music off.

1019
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:03,375
Sarah!

1020
01:22:03,458 --> 01:22:07,750
Sarah, Sarah, Sarah.

1021
01:22:07,833 --> 01:22:09,166
Stop it!

1022
01:22:09,708 --> 01:22:11,416
-Shut up!
-Sarah!

1023
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:15,250
Shut up!

1024
01:22:17,541 --> 01:22:22,791
-Oh, God. Oh, God.
-You can do it, man. Just don't look down.

1025
01:22:27,958 --> 01:22:29,666
Oh, God.

1026
01:22:31,250 --> 01:22:33,083
You can do it. You can do it.

1027
01:22:34,583 --> 01:22:36,000
I'll kill you.

1028
01:22:38,583 --> 01:22:40,000
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1029
01:22:42,416 --> 01:22:44,958
Oh, God.

1030
01:22:52,291 --> 01:22:53,708
Oh, God.

1031
01:22:58,875 --> 01:23:02,125
Sarah. Are you crazy or what?
Please, come here.

1032
01:23:02,208 --> 01:23:04,916
What do you want?
Do you want to spoil my fun, too?

1033
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,875
No. I want to know where Ben is.

1034
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,958
Ben is safe.

1035
01:23:09,041 --> 01:23:12,583
But I'm not, emotionally.

1036
01:23:13,416 --> 01:23:15,291
I can't. I can't.

1037
01:23:15,375 --> 01:23:18,083
I have to dance.

1038
01:23:18,166 --> 01:23:20,000
I want to fly.

1039
01:23:22,166 --> 01:23:24,041
Sarah! Shit, it's high.

1040
01:23:24,125 --> 01:23:26,416
Sarah. Stay. Shit.

1041
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:28,875
Sarah, please.
Please, come over here, okay?

1042
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:33,500
Get lost. Can't you see? I've got
something good going right now.

1043
01:23:33,833 --> 01:23:37,833
-Sarah, please get your ass over here now.
-Never!

1044
01:23:37,916 --> 01:23:40,666
Well, my little firefighter?

1045
01:23:47,958 --> 01:23:49,291
-Sarah!
-Mom!

1046
01:23:50,125 --> 01:23:51,875
It's my firefighter!

1047
01:23:56,250 --> 01:23:58,041
Come on.

1048
01:23:58,750 --> 01:24:02,000
Let's fly, my firefighter.

1049
01:24:02,875 --> 01:24:03,750
Shit.

1050
01:24:03,833 --> 01:24:06,000
-Sarah!
-We've got to do something.

1051
01:24:06,083 --> 01:24:07,500
Oh, God.

1052
01:24:08,541 --> 01:24:12,125
Sarah, hey, hey. This is really
dangerous. Please come here.

1053
01:24:12,208 --> 01:24:15,458
-No, I must...
-The sangria bowl.

1054
01:24:15,541 --> 01:24:17,541
...dance. I must fly.

1055
01:24:17,625 --> 01:24:20,083
Why the sangria bowl? You can't drink now.

1056
01:24:20,208 --> 01:24:22,125
-Baumi.
-I'm a bird.

1057
01:24:22,208 --> 01:24:23,666
Sarah, hey. Listen.

1058
01:24:23,750 --> 01:24:27,708
You can dance as much as you want.
But please dance over there, please.

1059
01:24:27,791 --> 01:24:31,541
Or better, let's go back down
and we can dance below. Where's Ben?

1060
01:24:31,625 --> 01:24:33,083
Ben is fine.

1061
01:24:33,166 --> 01:24:36,208
Because I'm watching him.
In contrast to you.

1062
01:24:36,291 --> 01:24:38,000
Help!

1063
01:24:38,083 --> 01:24:40,041
You're a complete catastrophe.

1064
01:24:40,125 --> 01:24:42,916
You brought a baby to a club.
And to a party.

1065
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,583
This is better, or what?

1066
01:24:44,666 --> 01:24:46,375
Po-tay-to. Po-tah-to.

1067
01:24:46,458 --> 01:24:49,500
Push. Push. Push.
Everything in there. Put it in there.

1068
01:24:49,583 --> 01:24:52,125
-Now tell me the fuck where my son is.
-No!

1069
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,583
You know what? I know guys like you.

1070
01:24:56,166 --> 01:24:57,583
You all fuck up.

1071
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:01,541
But Marie is my little sister.

1072
01:25:01,625 --> 01:25:03,500
Okay, stop, stop. Bring more drinks.

1073
01:25:03,583 --> 01:25:05,583
And if you leave her...

1074
01:25:06,666 --> 01:25:09,250
If you don't change, then I swear,

1075
01:25:09,333 --> 01:25:13,125
I'll chase you to the end of the world
and I'll kill you!

1076
01:25:15,291 --> 01:25:16,875
I know you, Gregor.

1077
01:25:17,458 --> 01:25:20,416
You piss off when things get tough, right?

1078
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:24,666
Leaving me, let me pay the rent...

1079
01:25:26,375 --> 01:25:28,375
let me raise babies by myself

1080
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:33,375
because you keep
getting out of taking responsibility.

1081
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:37,291
Because you're a coward, Gregor.

1082
01:25:37,375 --> 01:25:41,208
-And just a shitty father.
-Now shut up, okay?

1083
01:25:42,250 --> 01:25:44,166
I'm not Gregor. I'm Noah.

1084
01:25:46,666 --> 01:25:48,375
And I'm not a shitty father.

1085
01:25:49,083 --> 01:25:52,500
And I'm still learning.
Yeah, that's right. But I want to.

1086
01:25:52,583 --> 01:25:55,250
Okay? And I'll be
the best dad ever to Ben.

1087
01:25:55,333 --> 01:25:58,458
That's why I won't let you
take it away from me.

1088
01:25:58,541 --> 01:26:01,041
I won't let you come between us.

1089
01:26:01,125 --> 01:26:03,541
And believe it or not, I love Marie. Okay?

1090
01:26:03,625 --> 01:26:07,083
And I would never leave her
because I am not Gregor!

1091
01:26:07,166 --> 01:26:08,583
Shit, this is high!

1092
01:26:12,041 --> 01:26:13,041
Noah...

1093
01:26:15,125 --> 01:26:16,708
you suddenly have...

1094
01:26:21,333 --> 01:26:23,291
-...balls.
-Sarah. Hey!

1095
01:27:01,583 --> 01:27:03,083
Oh, God.

1096
01:27:12,666 --> 01:27:17,166
I want love.

1097
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:18,250
Yeah!

1098
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:31,333
Mom, that's Baumi. Stop it.

1099
01:27:32,791 --> 01:27:34,291
Yes, not with Baumi.

1100
01:27:35,541 --> 01:27:37,208
With my firefighter.

1101
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,875
I want my firefighter.

1102
01:27:41,916 --> 01:27:43,541
Love!

1103
01:27:44,791 --> 01:27:46,208
I want love.

1104
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,500
Quick question. Can you still drink that?

1105
01:27:52,583 --> 01:27:55,333
Of course we can still drink it.
It's alcohol.

1106
01:27:55,458 --> 01:27:57,291
Man, grab her.

1107
01:28:02,541 --> 01:28:03,583
Ben?

1108
01:28:35,291 --> 01:28:36,916
I love you, little guy.

1109
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:40,416
Thanks for not being mad at me.

1110
01:28:41,250 --> 01:28:43,041
And not a word to Mom, right?

1111
01:28:46,041 --> 01:28:48,625
At most, "Papa."

1112
01:29:15,041 --> 01:29:16,375
Love!

1113
01:29:47,666 --> 01:29:50,000
-Where am I?
-At home.

1114
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:54,750
What happened?

1115
01:29:55,166 --> 01:29:56,583
No memory?

1116
01:29:58,666 --> 01:30:03,083
I dreamed I was drowning,

1117
01:30:04,250 --> 01:30:06,333
but the water was, like, so yummy.

1118
01:30:07,583 --> 01:30:10,708
You were in a Jacuzzi full of sangria.

1119
01:30:12,333 --> 01:30:15,208
That's why now you're a party legend.

1120
01:30:19,750 --> 01:30:21,166
Klara,

1121
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,625
did I kiss Baumi?

1122
01:30:24,708 --> 01:30:26,708
Hey, that was just appropriate.

1123
01:30:26,791 --> 01:30:28,666
I mean, I rescued you.

1124
01:30:30,250 --> 01:30:31,583
Oh, God.

1125
01:30:33,791 --> 01:30:35,458
Noah carried you to the car.

1126
01:30:35,541 --> 01:30:37,666
Then sat with you all night.

1127
01:30:37,750 --> 01:30:38,916
I did that, too.

1128
01:30:39,791 --> 01:30:44,458
He was even ready to call the ambulance
and held his phone all night.

1129
01:30:44,541 --> 01:30:46,083
I didn't do that.

1130
01:30:47,208 --> 01:30:48,625
Really?

1131
01:30:49,125 --> 01:30:52,125
Yesterday, did he say anything about me

1132
01:30:52,208 --> 01:30:55,291
pulling Ben away from him and Marie?

1133
01:30:55,875 --> 01:30:57,333
Or was I dreaming that?

1134
01:30:57,416 --> 01:30:59,458
-He had that nerve?
-Respect.

1135
01:31:00,708 --> 01:31:04,000
-Where is he now?
-He's trying to get home before Marie.

1136
01:31:04,083 --> 01:31:07,166
-She's already on her way?
-Yes, and she thinks he's waiting

1137
01:31:07,250 --> 01:31:09,916
at home with Ben
who smells like rose petals.

1138
01:31:38,291 --> 01:31:39,416
Honey?

1139
01:32:05,916 --> 01:32:07,333
Hello.

1140
01:32:11,333 --> 01:32:12,666
Hi, sweetie.

1141
01:32:14,333 --> 01:32:17,333
-You're back early.
-I just wanted to be with you.

1142
01:32:18,750 --> 01:32:22,250
-Look who's here.
-Hi, my darling.

1143
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,208
Hello.

1144
01:32:24,958 --> 01:32:26,375
Hi.

1145
01:32:29,916 --> 01:32:31,791
How was the rest of your night?

1146
01:32:32,708 --> 01:32:34,666
Great, actually.

1147
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,166
Yeah...

1148
01:32:51,208 --> 01:32:52,375
Yeah, I know.

1149
01:32:56,833 --> 01:33:00,083
Well, it would have been great,

1150
01:33:01,333 --> 01:33:02,750
but...

1151
01:33:06,750 --> 01:33:08,166
Marie, I screwed up.

1152
01:33:12,583 --> 01:33:14,416
What did you do?

1153
01:33:16,583 --> 01:33:19,208
I took Ben to the last concert
at the Tube.

1154
01:33:20,291 --> 01:33:21,708
With Baumi.

1155
01:33:22,166 --> 01:33:25,708
And that's not all. Our car was stolen.
My wallet was in it.

1156
01:33:25,791 --> 01:33:30,666
I lost all the milk bags. I got in a fight
with a homeless guy over the last bag.

1157
01:33:31,125 --> 01:33:32,666
And lost.

1158
01:33:33,083 --> 01:33:36,166
And that's why I had to
steal baby formula from a minimart.

1159
01:33:36,250 --> 01:33:38,791
We were almost run over.

1160
01:33:39,875 --> 01:33:41,791
And arrested. Briefly, at least.

1161
01:33:41,875 --> 01:33:44,625
Because the cops thought
we were drug dealers.

1162
01:33:45,333 --> 01:33:47,291
But Sarah cleared everything up.

1163
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:52,375
Before she fell from high scaffolding
into a sangria pool.

1164
01:33:52,458 --> 01:33:55,291
Then we stayed with her overnight.
All of us.

1165
01:33:55,875 --> 01:33:59,375
Except, yes, Ben, he was wide awake.

1166
01:34:00,333 --> 01:34:01,708
I screwed up.

1167
01:34:01,791 --> 01:34:04,541
I am so sorry. Truly.

1168
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:18,166
"Everything's fine, sweetie.

1169
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:19,833
"It was a good night.

1170
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:24,375
"Noah is the best father for Ben
I could ever imagine.

1171
01:34:24,458 --> 01:34:29,666
"Have fun on parental leave, Noah.
Kiss, Sarah."

1172
01:34:31,458 --> 01:34:32,791
Nice try.

1173
01:34:37,541 --> 01:34:42,250
Marie. Wait a minute. I have to get
one thing straight, okay? Yesterday, I...

1174
01:34:42,333 --> 01:34:44,958
Noah. It's fine.

1175
01:34:46,416 --> 01:34:49,833
Or did you do something that
will affect Ben permanently?

1176
01:34:51,291 --> 01:34:54,791
No. That's not what it's about.
I just want you to trust me.

1177
01:34:56,833 --> 01:35:00,083
That's exactly what I was
thinking about this morning.

1178
01:35:00,666 --> 01:35:04,041
I never should have asked
Sarah to check in on you.

1179
01:35:05,375 --> 01:35:06,791
Ben is our child.

1180
01:35:07,750 --> 01:35:11,791
And you will always do
what's best for him, right?

1181
01:35:12,541 --> 01:35:14,958
Of course. Always.

1182
01:35:20,375 --> 01:35:23,833
And honestly, I've screwed up, too.

1183
01:35:25,208 --> 01:35:27,458
I forgot him on the bus the other day.

1184
01:35:27,541 --> 01:35:29,833
-You did what?
-Just for a second.

1185
01:35:29,916 --> 01:35:35,083
But believe me, you don't want to know
everything that's already happened to him.

1186
01:35:39,916 --> 01:35:41,541
He fell asleep.

1187
01:35:44,958 --> 01:35:46,375
In your arms.

1188
01:35:59,916 --> 01:36:02,208
Deichkind is playing here next week.

1189
01:36:02,291 --> 01:36:05,333
Deichkind? They were playing
the day Ben was born.

1190
01:36:05,666 --> 01:36:08,958
We could ask Sarah
if she could watch Ben for the night.

1191
01:36:09,958 --> 01:36:13,375
Or we could take him with us.
With noise-cancelling headphones.

1192
01:36:13,458 --> 01:36:15,625
Angelina Jolie always did that.

1193
01:36:55,416 --> 01:36:56,833
Tom?

1194
01:36:58,375 --> 01:36:59,791
Hey.

1195
01:37:01,208 --> 01:37:02,625
Hey.

1196
01:37:11,125 --> 01:37:13,541
It's time for you to get balls.

1197
01:37:14,458 --> 01:37:15,875
Balls!

1198
01:37:18,041 --> 01:37:20,291
Sarah... No. What's her name?

1199
01:37:21,541 --> 01:37:23,000
My sister.

1200
01:37:23,083 --> 01:37:24,791
I can do it.

1201
01:37:29,416 --> 01:37:31,375
What's up with you, man?

1202
01:37:33,708 --> 01:37:37,250
I'm looking for Noah. I know he was here.

1203
01:37:37,333 --> 01:37:39,708
Where did the mamba go? Again...

1204
01:37:39,791 --> 01:37:43,750
Hey. Just one song. I just want to
show him my club before...

1205
01:37:43,833 --> 01:37:45,583
No entry without teeth.

1206
01:37:45,666 --> 01:37:47,500
Hey!

1207
01:37:50,375 --> 01:37:51,791
Where are the others?

1208
01:37:56,125 --> 01:37:57,750
Where are the others?

1209
01:37:58,166 --> 01:37:59,666
-Broken.
-What?

1210
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:08,208
-Hey. A minimart.
-A minimart?

1211
01:38:08,291 --> 01:38:10,125
-They must have it.
-Breast milk.

1212
01:38:10,208 --> 01:38:13,500
That's my car.
A black Audi with the license number...

1213
01:38:13,583 --> 01:38:16,416
M-W-N-L-O-P...

1214
01:38:20,250 --> 01:38:22,333

1216
01:38:24,750 --> 01:38:27,041

1217
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:32,333

1218
01:38:32,416 --> 01:38:34,750
-Did I hurt you?
-I'm fine.

Hey, if she ate that...

1220
01:38:38,625 --> 01:38:40,041
Ben.

1221
01:38:44,208 --> 01:38:46,291
