1
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:28,737
Long ago,

2
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,990
a prophecy foretold
the rise of a chosen one,

3
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:35,577
a woman with fiery hair,
who would reshape the world.

4
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:39,540
But the gods, fearing her power,

5
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:42,000
whispered into
the hearts of men,

6
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:45,212
urging them to burn
any child who fit the prophecy.

7
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:50,467
And so, innocence was lost,
as the innocent

8
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,511
were consumed
by the flames of fear.

9
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:11,530
No.

10
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:15,158
Have mercy, she's only a child.

11
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,832
This child is a gift
from the light,

12
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:25,169
she's your daughter,
your seed, I swear it.

13
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,047
Don't damn your soul!

14
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:38,891
Avalon, take my hand.

15
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:47,733
No, you don't have to do this.

16
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:54,907
She is your daughter,
I am your faithful wife.

17
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:00,871
No!

18
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,332
No! No!

19
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:41,930
Something dark
has happened here.

20
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,773
Tell me, do you dream of her?

21
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:56,987
You do, don't you?

22
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:01,533
I saw nothing,
because there was no dream.

23
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:03,702
Then why did you wake
with such a fright?

24
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:04,912
Because I felt the eyes

25
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:07,789
of a little man watching me
while I slept.

26
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,875
And I haven't eaten.

27
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,753
How about I give you a taste
if you tell me your dream?

28
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,965
Food first.

29
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,634
Dream first.

30
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:21,970
All right.

31
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,932
I dreamt I was with three women,

32
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:27,100
and they all wanted me
at the same time,

33
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,978
but I couldn't decide
which one to please first.

34
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:32,397
I don't believe you.

35
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:33,357
And now you know

36
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,275
why I was so angry
when you woke me.

37
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:37,361
I was very disappointed to
see your face.

38
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,612
If that was your dream,

39
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,156
you would have awoken
holding a different sword.

40
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,534
Hmm. Perhaps.

41
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,577
Father, they've come.

42
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:04,805
Go find the men and tell them
what you have seen.

43
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,723
The prophecy is true.

44
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,017
Your men, they will not come.

45
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:11,979
They will not believe the boy.

46
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,272
Let us all go.

47
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,148
Tell them what you
have seen yourself.

48
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:18,235
Whatever they're preparing,
it happens tonight.

49
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,990
Our lives are in your hand.

50
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,825
I'm not worried, father.

51
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:25,993
I know.

52
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:29,913
Be safe.

53
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,793
You be safe, my nephew.

54
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:36,670
I will see you again, Uncle.

55
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,338
Here, in the glory of the light.

56
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:39,631
Again, nephew.

57
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:40,883
Not in glory.

58
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,050
Not yet.

59
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,686
You may have sent him
to his death.

60
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:56,356
When they hear the prophecy
is true, they will come.

61
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,442
You blindly believe in people.

62
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,777
And you don't believe
in them at all.

63
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,254
Air flows from above.

64
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:01,964
Yes.

65
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,966
But where does it lead?

66
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,759
Did your dream not tell you?

67
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,137
Did yours?

68
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:10,681
I would like to hear
more about this dream

69
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,474
with the three women.

70
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:14,309
Take me back there now.

71
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:15,894
I wonder, though.

72
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:17,396
Were you just changing
the details

73
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,481
from when you used
to sleep with the pigs?

74
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:21,692
-What?
-Bhodie, the pig pleaser.

75
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,904
You know, it's a shame Father
didn't have room

76
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:28,991
in his castle
for one more bastard.

77
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:32,369
Yes, Father's seed was sown
far and wide.

78
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,413
Luckily for you,
you were born

79
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:35,831
with Father's gift of sight.

80
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:37,749
Hmm. But not his name.

81
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,794
After this, Bhodie,
you won't need his name.

82
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:43,338
That's because only the living
have need of a name.

83
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:48,093
It's begun.

84
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:41,063
It's the Brother of Caius.

85
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:44,233
They're sacrificing
themselves for the gods.

86
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,569
You mean demons.

87
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:50,280
They are killing themselves
for demons.

88
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,449
One man's gods,
another man's demon.

89
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,995
The longer we wait,
the less there'll be to fight.

90
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,666
There's the torch.

91
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,755
We must find a way in.

92
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:41,456
If you still want to leave--

93
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:46,837
What are they doing?

94
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:49,673
They're preparing her body.

95
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,301
For what?

96
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:55,095
To free the fallen.

97
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:07,941
They are opening
a gateway to hell.

98
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:11,862
Whatever happens,

99
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,739
we cannot let a demon
through that gate.

100
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:18,702
You've seen this before,
haven't you?

101
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,370
I promise you, brother.

102
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,080
We will walk out of here
alive today.

103
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:13,293
Bhodie!

104
00:13:13,377 --> 00:13:14,545
Help me!

105
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:30,519
Why did they stop?

106
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:37,192
Demon.

107
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:55,878
No!

108
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:22,196
Bhodie, do you remember
your pledge?

109
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:25,240
We have failed.

110
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:26,408
No, we haven't.

111
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:27,993
Not yet.

112
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,120
Did you mean it, those words?

113
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:31,580
She cannot be saved.

114
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:32,664
What if she could?

115
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:33,916
How far would you go?

116
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:35,292
Would you go to the ends
of the earth?

117
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,710
She's gone, brother!

118
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:39,087
Swear it and mean it
or say nothing at all.

119
00:14:41,465 --> 00:14:43,008
I would do all that is required

120
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:46,428
to fulfill the prophecy,
including giving my life.

121
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,140
I know.

122
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:55,729
But this is your destiny.

123
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:02,778
You will fight for her
when others will not.

124
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:05,572
You will protect her
when others fail.

125
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:08,158
You will be the shield
while the storm rages on.

126
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:10,410
That is your destiny.

127
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:15,165
Remember,
no matter how dark it gets,

128
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:16,875
light will make a way.

129
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,213
Come with me.

130
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:15,434
Poor, poor knight.

131
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:19,021
Betrayed by his brother.

132
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:22,316
Abandoned by his father.

133
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,402
Chasing the promise of glory.

134
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:31,450
But will any be found?

135
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:32,826
Who are you?

136
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:36,955
I am the lonely Keeper
of this realm.

137
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,415
And what is this place?

138
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:45,214
You failed to protect her.

139
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,176
Now you've traveled through
the Forbidden Gate

140
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:53,305
to the land of the gods.

141
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,102
Do you want my help?

142
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:02,022
Can I afford the help
of a demon?

143
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:04,441
My kindness is not enough.

144
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:05,484
Speak plainly, demon.

145
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:06,693
What is your wage?

146
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:11,823
I can help you
save the chosen one.

147
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:14,159
And why was she?

148
00:17:14,243 --> 00:17:15,827
The girl with the fire for hair.

149
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:18,956
I made a bargain.

150
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,415
I gave her this.

151
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:25,087
This will allow you to die
a hundred deaths.

152
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,005
I offer it to you.

153
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:30,551
A hundred deaths?

154
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:32,177
More or less.

155
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:33,428
Hopefully less.

156
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,807
And what of your bargain?

157
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,184
The bargain?

158
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:42,271
Yes.

159
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:46,900
All I ask
is that when the gate opens,

160
00:17:48,694 --> 00:17:52,364
you will suffer me
passage with you to your realm.

161
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:56,952
That is the price
of a hundred deaths.

162
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:59,496
More or less.

163
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,415
More or less.

164
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:04,001
And how do I return
to my brother?

165
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:06,128
Three lords hold three stones.

166
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:10,299
And has the chosen one
gone to fight these lords?

167
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:11,508
She has.

168
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:12,885
And you are wasting time.

169
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:20,559
Why don't I just kill you,
demon?

170
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:24,062
You may try, I suppose.

171
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:28,692
But the power of the talisman
only works

172
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,485
as long as I still have breath.

173
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:41,163
Fine, Keeper.

174
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:43,165
If I succeed,

175
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:45,042
I'll allow you passage through
the gate with us.

176
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,418
A fine bargain.

177
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:49,838
But it must be sealed in blood.

178
00:18:57,554 --> 00:18:58,764
Just a drop.

179
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:08,148
When I cover your wound,

180
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:12,277
I may not be able to
help myself.

181
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:15,531
Betray me, demon.

182
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:16,823
And I will hunt you through
the ages.

183
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:18,700
Yes, very worth.

184
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,162
As long as there is light
in this talisman,

185
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:27,334
you will be able to die
and be reborn.

186
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:31,713
If the light dies,

187
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,717
you die with it.

188
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:48,981
Having second thoughts?

189
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:55,672
Name your purpose.

190
00:20:58,634 --> 00:21:00,469
You are outmatched.

191
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:05,057
So be it, little mouse.

192
00:21:17,528 --> 00:21:19,905
I demand that you
cut me down now.

193
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:22,032
You've made a grave mistake.

194
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:25,994
It would be wise for you
to release me right now.

195
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:27,246
Looks like you're the one

196
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:30,415
that's trapped now,
little mouse.

197
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:39,007
A knight of the light,
here in the realm of the fallen.

198
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:43,804
One would wonder
what crime he committed

199
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:45,430
to be sent here.

200
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:48,308
Or does he hunt the witch?

201
00:21:51,687 --> 00:21:53,355
You're not the witch, are you?

202
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:55,399
If so, no, I'm not hunting
the witch.

203
00:22:06,702 --> 00:22:07,828
Who sent you?

204
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:11,832
I'm here because
of the prophecy.

205
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:13,375
Which one do you speak of?

206
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:14,751
Prophecy of a woman,

207
00:22:14,835 --> 00:22:16,920
who couldn't be burned with
flames for hair.

208
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:18,505
She would dispel the darkness

209
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:21,466
and unite all men against
the return of the gods.

210
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:24,011
And where did you hear
of this great prophecy?

211
00:22:24,094 --> 00:22:26,263
My father and brother dreamt it

212
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:29,016
and it was confirmed in
the ancient text of the light.

213
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:31,101
And would you have me believe

214
00:22:31,185 --> 00:22:33,520
that you are here in the land
of the gods,

215
00:22:33,604 --> 00:22:36,064
risking your life, because
a dream and an old book

216
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:37,691
told you so?

217
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:40,277
Well, you are here, aren't you?

218
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,238
And you think I am
the woman from the prophecy,

219
00:22:43,322 --> 00:22:45,115
the one who will unite
and save man?

220
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:46,533
I would hope so.

221
00:22:46,617 --> 00:22:47,993
Or have I followed
the wrong woman through

222
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:50,162
the forbidden gate?

223
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:52,080
You are gravely mistaken.

224
00:22:52,164 --> 00:22:54,666
Would you care to elaborate?

225
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:58,754
You are mistaken,
because of my hatred for man.

226
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:00,797
Why would I want to save them?

227
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:03,800
I think mankind
refers to women as well.

228
00:23:05,511 --> 00:23:08,680
Surely, there is someone at home
worth saving.

229
00:23:08,764 --> 00:23:11,391
Let me be clear, Knight.

230
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:13,644
I want nothing to do
with your prophecy.

231
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:17,272
Mankind has done nothing
for me, but cause me pain.

232
00:23:17,356 --> 00:23:20,817
And if I had the power,
I would destroy them myself.

233
00:23:20,901 --> 00:23:23,403
How's that for your prophecy?

234
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:25,656
I will admit,
I like my version more.

235
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:27,866
Also, if you can't even best me,

236
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,368
how do you think
you can help me?

237
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:31,495
I tend to think well on my feet.

238
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:48,470
Then you'd better stand.

239
00:23:48,554 --> 00:23:50,889
Because tonight, we are
going to kill a witch.

240
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:54,560
And just like that,
you'll trust me?

241
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:58,272
You're wearing
the Keeper's talisman,

242
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:00,232
which means you made
the same barter as I.

243
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:06,989
I'm Bhodie, son of Azra.

244
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:14,746
Usually, this is the part
where you introduce yourself.

245
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:19,626
How long has it been
since you saw me in the chamber?

246
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:23,172
Not even an hour has passed.

247
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:29,344
For me, it was a lifetime ago.

248
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:33,140
Listen carefully, Knight.

249
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:35,475
I have fought the witch for
as long as I can remember.

250
00:24:37,186 --> 00:24:39,897
Each night, no matter what I do,

251
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,566
it captures me,
peels back my skin,

252
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:45,903
drinking my blood.

253
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:48,530
It is a pain like you have
never felt in your life.

254
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:51,867
You will be forced
to relive the darkest

255
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:56,580
moments of your existence
over and over again.

256
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:59,249
Then you will die,
and be reborn,

257
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:01,752
and have to muster the courage
to do it all over again.

258
00:25:07,591 --> 00:25:09,593
So how does one avoid

259
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:13,388
living the darkest moments
over and over again?

260
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,599
Your blood is fresh.

261
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:18,060
The witch will be
drawn to you.

262
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:20,103
As it pursues, I will circle
from behind

263
00:25:20,187 --> 00:25:23,232
and then we will kill it
together.

264
00:25:23,315 --> 00:25:26,109
So you intend to set a trap
and use me for the bait.

265
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:28,779
Do you want the stone?

266
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:32,407
Also, you ruined my trap,
so now you are the new one.

267
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:36,745
You still haven't told me
your name.

268
00:25:37,955 --> 00:25:39,957
Avalon.

269
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,125
Avalon.

270
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:45,212
Well, Avalon, you tell me,

271
00:25:45,295 --> 00:25:46,713
how does this
Keeper's necklace--

272
00:25:46,797 --> 00:25:48,841
-No, don't!
-Even work?

273
00:25:51,969 --> 00:25:54,805
Who is this--

274
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:57,975
Ah, Bhodie.

275
00:25:58,058 --> 00:26:00,811
Son of Azrael.

276
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:05,524
How have you crossed
through the Forbidden Gate?

277
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:11,488
Surrender yourself

278
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:15,701
and receive my judgment.

279
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:20,873
Have you succumbed?

280
00:26:20,956 --> 00:26:21,957
What happened to me?

281
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:22,916
Have you succumbed?

282
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,418
Succumbed to what?

283
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:26,128
What did you see?

284
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:27,379
What did they say?

285
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,965
He told me to call
out to him.

286
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:31,133
Did you?

287
00:26:31,216 --> 00:26:32,509
No.

288
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:43,228
Never keep your talisman off.

289
00:26:43,312 --> 00:26:45,314
It shrouds you from his sight.

290
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:47,774
Now he has found you
and knows that we are coming.

291
00:26:47,858 --> 00:26:50,110
Who has found me?

292
00:26:50,194 --> 00:26:51,528
You're out of your depth,
Knight.

293
00:26:53,488 --> 00:26:54,823
The Invoker.

294
00:26:54,907 --> 00:26:56,116
His gaze has set upon you

295
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,784
and now you have doomed
our quest.

296
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:05,542
At another time,

297
00:27:05,626 --> 00:27:07,336
I would appreciate your
offer to comfort me,

298
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:09,546
but given
our current situation--

299
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:12,132
I'm not trying to lie with you.

300
00:27:12,216 --> 00:27:13,675
Oh.

301
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:15,177
We have lost most of the day.

302
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,221
We must move quickly.

303
00:27:17,304 --> 00:27:19,640
The night comes and with it,
the witch.

304
00:27:19,723 --> 00:27:21,725
Yes, and with the witch
comes our glory.

305
00:27:21,808 --> 00:27:24,102
There will be no glory today.

306
00:27:24,186 --> 00:27:25,437
Only pain.

307
00:27:28,607 --> 00:27:31,235
Why are you removing
my armour then?

308
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:33,278
You'll be able to run faster
without it.

309
00:27:33,362 --> 00:27:34,863
Run?

310
00:27:34,947 --> 00:27:36,657
You think of me a coward.

311
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:39,493
I need you to run.

312
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:40,827
That's the trap.

313
00:27:50,754 --> 00:27:52,422
So there's the stone.

314
00:27:55,801 --> 00:27:57,261
But where's the witch?

315
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:21,159
Why do you cry?

316
00:28:22,578 --> 00:28:24,037
Oh.

317
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:26,415
I cry tears of happiness.

318
00:28:26,498 --> 00:28:27,833
A demon.

319
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:29,459
Yes.

320
00:28:29,543 --> 00:28:31,170
And who is this?

321
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:39,052
He's the helper.

322
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:44,308
Come out of the shadows
and face me.

323
00:28:45,851 --> 00:28:48,937
He has come to sustain us.

324
00:28:50,564 --> 00:28:53,400
I can taste his blood
in the air.

325
00:28:54,985 --> 00:28:56,069
Come.

326
00:28:56,153 --> 00:28:57,279
Help us.

327
00:28:57,362 --> 00:28:58,864
Worship us.

328
00:28:58,947 --> 00:29:01,533
Let us each have a turn
and partake.

329
00:29:01,617 --> 00:29:03,493
I come for the stone.

330
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:05,829
Give it freely and you will
not be harmed.

331
00:29:05,913 --> 00:29:07,206
He comes for the stone.

332
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:09,166
He comes for the stone.

333
00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:11,376
Should we give it to him?

334
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,588
Oh, the stone.

335
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:17,216
Yes.

336
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:21,470
Many come for its power.

337
00:29:21,553 --> 00:29:25,390
What do you offer?

338
00:29:25,474 --> 00:29:28,018
What do you require?

339
00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:28,977
Blood.

340
00:29:29,061 --> 00:29:31,021
Suffering.

341
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:32,564
Pain.

342
00:29:32,648 --> 00:29:35,275
Then pain and suffering
you will have.

343
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:37,444
But it will be your own.

344
00:29:37,528 --> 00:29:39,613
Here is my last offer.

345
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:41,198
Give me the stone.

346
00:29:43,408 --> 00:29:47,412
We will start with pain.

347
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:54,336
Come out of the shadows
and face me.

348
00:29:55,629 --> 00:29:57,881
Beside you. Over here.

349
00:30:20,028 --> 00:30:21,738
More.

350
00:30:31,081 --> 00:30:33,667
Hello. Did you miss?

351
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:49,892
Oh. Don't run, little knight.

352
00:30:49,975 --> 00:30:52,394
You wouldn't want to spoil.

353
00:31:02,613 --> 00:31:06,450
I can hear your heartbeat.

354
00:31:17,002 --> 00:31:18,086
Hang on. Hang on.

355
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:21,131
Oh, little knight.

356
00:31:22,591 --> 00:31:25,469
Come play with sisters divine,

357
00:31:25,552 --> 00:31:27,179
he came far,

358
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:34,478
but all he will
receive is suffering.

359
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:44,298
Do you know now who we are?

360
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:51,388
We are the promise.

361
00:32:51,471 --> 00:32:55,392
The promise of pain.

362
00:32:55,475 --> 00:32:57,394
The past,

363
00:32:57,477 --> 00:33:00,272
future,

364
00:33:00,355 --> 00:33:02,316
the present.

365
00:33:34,264 --> 00:33:36,141
Scream for me.

366
00:33:53,158 --> 00:33:54,535
Don't go anywhere.

367
00:33:55,953 --> 00:33:58,205
There's a matter we have
to attend to.

368
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:03,001
Tend the other guest.

369
00:34:37,786 --> 00:34:40,372
The lord of the stone
must be overcome.

370
00:35:52,486 --> 00:35:53,403
Welcome back.

371
00:35:55,864 --> 00:35:57,282
How?

372
00:35:57,366 --> 00:36:00,494
I warned you,
the witch's power is great.

373
00:36:00,577 --> 00:36:03,163
I felt them drinking my pain.

374
00:36:03,247 --> 00:36:04,206
My agony.

375
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:06,333
And then you died,
yet you are here.

376
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:07,793
How is this possible?

377
00:36:07,876 --> 00:36:09,086
A hundred deaths.

378
00:36:13,924 --> 00:36:17,469
And you, you betrayed me.

379
00:36:17,553 --> 00:36:19,680
And I had the stone.

380
00:36:21,056 --> 00:36:22,558
You lied to me.

381
00:36:22,641 --> 00:36:25,185
You've already lied to me.

382
00:36:25,269 --> 00:36:26,854
How have I lied?

383
00:36:26,937 --> 00:36:28,647
When you told me why
you were here.

384
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:29,857
The prophecy.

385
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,441
How is that a lie?

386
00:36:31,525 --> 00:36:32,985
I am here for you.

387
00:36:41,243 --> 00:36:42,661
You don't even know who I am.

388
00:36:42,744 --> 00:36:45,497
No, obviously not.

389
00:36:45,581 --> 00:36:48,208
You're here to help yourself.

390
00:36:48,292 --> 00:36:50,752
But now you know what
this place is.

391
00:36:50,836 --> 00:36:53,964
Now you'll forget your prophecy,
your promise,

392
00:36:54,047 --> 00:36:56,925
and you'll do whatever
you can to escape this hell.

393
00:36:57,009 --> 00:37:00,804
You'll even sacrifice me
and your prophecy to do it.

394
00:37:00,888 --> 00:37:03,390
That is the truth.

395
00:37:03,473 --> 00:37:06,059
Listen here,
you betray me again--

396
00:37:06,143 --> 00:37:08,187
And what?

397
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:09,438
You'll kill me?

398
00:37:10,564 --> 00:37:12,065
Hurry up then.

399
00:37:12,149 --> 00:37:13,483
Add to the scars.

400
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:15,110
Make it interesting.

401
00:37:17,029 --> 00:37:18,197
I didn't think so.

402
00:37:19,615 --> 00:37:21,617
It doesn't matter anyway.

403
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,327
It's all an evil trick.

404
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:25,621
How so?

405
00:37:25,704 --> 00:37:27,956
I had the stone.

406
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,958
We had won.

407
00:37:30,042 --> 00:37:31,793
And it turned to dust
in my hand.

408
00:37:33,212 --> 00:37:36,340
We must overcome
the lord of each stone.

409
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:38,967
Maybe that means
we need to kill them

410
00:37:39,051 --> 00:37:40,719
instead of trying to
sneak around.

411
00:37:40,802 --> 00:37:42,596
The witches cannot be killed.

412
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:44,640
I have tried more
than a hundred times.

413
00:37:44,723 --> 00:37:47,726
You've tried
a hundred times alone.

414
00:37:47,809 --> 00:37:49,978
You've never tried with me.

415
00:37:50,062 --> 00:37:52,147
Let us work together.

416
00:37:52,231 --> 00:37:53,315
What say you?

417
00:37:56,151 --> 00:37:57,694
Doesn't matter what I say.

418
00:37:58,987 --> 00:38:01,448
Darkness comes and with it,
our death.

419
00:38:03,158 --> 00:38:04,618
Or maybe our life.

420
00:38:16,296 --> 00:38:18,507
What do we do now?

421
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,842
We wait.

422
00:38:24,388 --> 00:38:25,639
Oh, Bhodie,

423
00:38:25,722 --> 00:38:28,517
you should have stayed
at home with the pigs.

424
00:38:41,029 --> 00:38:43,740
So how did you get captured
by the brothers of Caius?

425
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:50,289
I wasn't captured.

426
00:38:50,372 --> 00:38:52,833
I found them and came
here by my choosing.

427
00:38:52,916 --> 00:38:55,460
You willingly went to the Caius?

428
00:38:55,544 --> 00:38:57,671
Why?

429
00:38:57,754 --> 00:38:59,590
They said they could help me.

430
00:38:59,673 --> 00:39:02,009
So you didn't need to be
saved after all.

431
00:39:05,387 --> 00:39:06,722
I never said I did.

432
00:39:09,766 --> 00:39:12,186
Of course not.

433
00:39:12,269 --> 00:39:15,147
The next time I see a woman
bound by savages,

434
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:17,566
I'll just assume she's there
of her own free accord.

435
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,154
I have come for the stone.

436
00:39:53,769 --> 00:39:55,646
I claim the boy.

437
00:39:55,729 --> 00:39:57,898
I like the way he screams.

438
00:40:54,621 --> 00:40:57,332
How does glory taste?

439
00:40:57,416 --> 00:41:00,043
I will not fail again.

440
00:41:00,127 --> 00:41:01,795
The light shall prevail.

441
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:15,184
What were you hoping for?

442
00:41:15,267 --> 00:41:17,811
That they would just stand there
and let you chop them down?

443
00:41:22,107 --> 00:41:24,401
The only screams
will be yours tonight.

444
00:41:28,864 --> 00:41:30,866
Oh, and charging them
like a boar.

445
00:41:30,949 --> 00:41:32,492
Why didn't I think of that?

446
00:41:38,582 --> 00:41:39,958
You were late.

447
00:41:40,042 --> 00:41:41,752
You went early.

448
00:41:52,513 --> 00:41:53,847
Who's early now?

449
00:42:00,437 --> 00:42:01,730
Was it worth it?

450
00:42:01,813 --> 00:42:03,690
Yes, it was.

451
00:42:03,774 --> 00:42:07,319
-For fearing God.
-Look at me.

452
00:42:07,402 --> 00:42:09,404
Do you see how mine is dimmed?

453
00:42:09,488 --> 00:42:12,616
Each death has a cost
and it's one step closer to us

454
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:15,160
being trapped here forever.

455
00:42:15,244 --> 00:42:20,165
This is only the first lord
and we have two more after this.

456
00:42:20,249 --> 00:42:24,002
You came here to save me.

457
00:42:24,086 --> 00:42:25,629
Start acting like it.

458
00:42:29,091 --> 00:42:30,843
The light shall prevail.

459
00:42:43,772 --> 00:42:45,732
You swing like a brute.

460
00:42:45,816 --> 00:42:47,401
Are you even trying to hit them?

461
00:42:49,194 --> 00:42:51,446
Know this, you foul creature.

462
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:54,324
When I awake, I will make
your life a living hell.

463
00:43:52,424 --> 00:43:53,675
So you do bleed.

464
00:44:03,185 --> 00:44:04,853
What happens to one
happens to both.

465
00:44:07,898 --> 00:44:09,775
Don't you see?

466
00:44:09,858 --> 00:44:12,611
Their strength is
their weakness.

467
00:44:12,694 --> 00:44:15,739
We only need one strike.

468
00:44:15,822 --> 00:44:18,742
What have you been trying
to do this whole time?

469
00:44:18,825 --> 00:44:20,536
Dance with them?

470
00:44:20,619 --> 00:44:22,496
Of course, we need to strike.

471
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:26,208
No, we need one strike.

472
00:44:29,086 --> 00:44:30,462
I'm listening.

473
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:39,805
Last time.

474
00:45:34,234 --> 00:45:37,279
Your blood grows cold.

475
00:45:37,362 --> 00:45:42,409
But the boy, still so fresh.

476
00:45:47,247 --> 00:45:50,667
What's wrong boy, you afraid?

477
00:45:50,751 --> 00:45:54,588
No words from the brave knight?

478
00:45:54,671 --> 00:45:56,256
Don't be shy.

479
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,595
Say something!

480
00:46:10,103 --> 00:46:10,771
You cannot see me.

481
00:46:14,566 --> 00:46:15,817
They're blind.

482
00:46:17,819 --> 00:46:18,987
They're blind.

483
00:46:20,531 --> 00:46:21,823
They are blind.

484
00:46:21,907 --> 00:46:24,409
- Please, I need to rest.
- No, wait, please.

485
00:46:24,493 --> 00:46:25,827
What was that you were
saying earlier?

486
00:46:25,911 --> 00:46:28,580
The witches cannot see us.

487
00:46:28,664 --> 00:46:29,998
So?

488
00:46:30,082 --> 00:46:32,543
Even when we are quiet,
they can hear our breath.

489
00:46:32,626 --> 00:46:35,254
Then we will mask
the sound of our breath.

490
00:46:35,337 --> 00:46:38,966
And how does one mask
their breath?

491
00:46:39,049 --> 00:46:41,927
We will hide the sound
of our breath behind these.

492
00:47:34,521 --> 00:47:37,482
The knight thinks
he's so clever.

493
00:47:41,653 --> 00:47:45,407
He thinks because we are blind,
we cannot see.

494
00:48:06,136 --> 00:48:07,846
I can hear you.

495
00:48:11,767 --> 00:48:17,064
I can hear your heartbeat.

496
00:48:41,296 --> 00:48:43,882
You can't hide from me.

497
00:48:47,386 --> 00:48:51,890
I wasn't trying to.

498
00:49:53,577 --> 00:49:54,578
You did it.

499
00:49:54,661 --> 00:49:57,497
You defeated the first lord,
my king.

500
00:49:57,581 --> 00:50:00,250
But you are troubled, my lord.

501
00:50:00,334 --> 00:50:03,921
Your brother sees her
as the savior of mankind.

502
00:50:04,004 --> 00:50:06,673
But you've seen what
she becomes.

503
00:50:06,757 --> 00:50:08,675
She's already betrayed you.

504
00:50:17,726 --> 00:50:20,979
Welcome back
to the land of the dead.

505
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:25,901
One lord is slain.

506
00:50:25,984 --> 00:50:27,152
Two more remain.

507
00:50:29,196 --> 00:50:32,741
You have done what many have
failed to do before you

508
00:50:32,824 --> 00:50:33,951
Before me?

509
00:50:35,369 --> 00:50:37,996
How many others have
there been?

510
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,998
All those who pass
through the gate

511
00:50:40,082 --> 00:50:41,625
suffer a similar fate.

512
00:50:43,377 --> 00:50:45,462
Where's Avalon?

513
00:50:45,546 --> 00:50:48,549
She is soaking her wounds
from battle.

514
00:50:48,632 --> 00:50:50,425
She waits for you
in the bathhouse.

515
00:50:53,345 --> 00:50:56,139
Avalon tells me that you
removed your talisman

516
00:50:56,223 --> 00:50:57,724
and saw one of the lords.

517
00:50:59,142 --> 00:51:01,186
Which one did you see?

518
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:03,146
I saw the Horned Demon.

519
00:51:05,274 --> 00:51:06,900
And what did he say to you?

520
00:51:09,736 --> 00:51:11,780
He asked how I came
to this place.

521
00:51:11,864 --> 00:51:13,031
Is that it?

522
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:15,826
Yes.

523
00:51:24,126 --> 00:51:25,460
She waits for you.

524
00:51:44,771 --> 00:51:46,982
We did it, Knight.

525
00:51:47,065 --> 00:51:48,650
We defeated the first lord.

526
00:51:53,614 --> 00:51:55,616
I would back away.

527
00:51:55,699 --> 00:51:57,034
This isn't water.

528
00:52:00,495 --> 00:52:04,208
You don't look at me,
but you desire to.

529
00:52:06,376 --> 00:52:08,253
You aren't mine.

530
00:52:08,337 --> 00:52:10,881
And who is supposed
to give me away?

531
00:52:10,964 --> 00:52:12,299
You are.

532
00:52:38,283 --> 00:52:41,578
These are the tears
of the tormented.

533
00:52:41,662 --> 00:52:44,373
One day, they will fuel
hell forever.

534
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:01,431
A light's promise.

535
00:53:03,851 --> 00:53:06,270
Still holding on
to your prophecy,

536
00:53:07,563 --> 00:53:09,898
do not be mistaken.

537
00:53:09,982 --> 00:53:11,775
I may not burn,

538
00:53:11,859 --> 00:53:13,902
but I am not the woman
from your prophecy.

539
00:53:21,118 --> 00:53:24,204
You said you're here
for your revenge.

540
00:53:24,288 --> 00:53:27,249
What revenge can be gained
from here?

541
00:53:27,332 --> 00:53:31,420
It is not revenge, but the means
to do so that I seek.

542
00:53:31,503 --> 00:53:33,755
Well, do tell.

543
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:36,133
I seek a weapon of great power

544
00:53:36,216 --> 00:53:38,427
that would force even the light
to bend its knee.

545
00:53:40,512 --> 00:53:42,055
And where is this weapon?

546
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:50,230
It is guarded by the final lord.

547
00:53:59,281 --> 00:54:01,366
The Invoker.

548
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:03,327
What does the sword do?

549
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:05,412
It gives you the power
of the gods.

550
00:54:08,373 --> 00:54:10,584
And what will you do
with this power?

551
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:20,636
Revenge.

552
00:54:20,719 --> 00:54:22,471
And you must be on your way.

553
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:27,059
The Invoker holds
the second stone.

554
00:54:29,019 --> 00:54:30,771
The gods will be afraid now

555
00:54:30,854 --> 00:54:32,856
that two humans killed,
but couldn't be killed.

556
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:34,608
You are mistaken.

557
00:54:36,568 --> 00:54:39,655
Those who failed to kill
the witch before you

558
00:54:39,738 --> 00:54:42,074
will now come.

559
00:54:42,157 --> 00:54:47,287
Your enemies have multiplied.

560
00:54:47,371 --> 00:54:49,331
And what does it matter?

561
00:54:49,414 --> 00:54:52,751
If we die, then we are reborn.

562
00:54:52,835 --> 00:54:55,671
One of us has died
more than the other.

563
00:54:55,754 --> 00:54:58,090
Avalon is right.

564
00:54:58,173 --> 00:54:59,758
She can no longer risk death.

565
00:55:01,718 --> 00:55:03,345
Her soul cannot handle it.

566
00:55:05,305 --> 00:55:07,724
How do we reach the Invoker?

567
00:55:07,808 --> 00:55:09,726
There are two paths
to the Invoker.

568
00:55:12,229 --> 00:55:14,231
The first climbs
over icy mountains.

569
00:55:17,401 --> 00:55:20,070
The second is much faster.

570
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,156
But it's plagued by demons.

571
00:55:25,158 --> 00:55:27,244
And the Invoker's eye is on it.

572
00:55:29,496 --> 00:55:33,542
Those who take that path
usually overcome.

573
00:55:33,625 --> 00:55:35,627
And what of the third stone?

574
00:55:35,711 --> 00:55:37,254
Where do we find it?

575
00:55:37,337 --> 00:55:39,131
Lilith.

576
00:55:39,214 --> 00:55:41,175
She will find you.

577
00:55:41,258 --> 00:55:42,968
And bring her bargain.

578
00:55:43,051 --> 00:55:44,344
And one may wonder

579
00:55:44,428 --> 00:55:47,014
if we should have taken
the bargain from you, demon.

580
00:55:47,097 --> 00:55:48,307
One may wonder

581
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:52,227
how many times my bargain
has saved you, Knight.

582
00:55:52,311 --> 00:55:54,521
Let us finish this.

583
00:55:54,605 --> 00:55:56,440
Open the gate, Keeper.

584
00:56:10,204 --> 00:56:12,206
Do you trust this demon?

585
00:56:14,917 --> 00:56:18,128
He has been with me
for as long as I can remember.

586
00:56:18,212 --> 00:56:20,214
Which way shall we take?

587
00:56:20,297 --> 00:56:23,008
I would rather face the
mountain
than fight more demons.

588
00:56:26,094 --> 00:56:28,096
Then it is the narrow path.

589
00:56:37,356 --> 00:56:39,942
The Keeper says
we are going to be followed.

590
00:56:40,025 --> 00:56:42,694
The stone's not safe.

591
00:56:42,778 --> 00:56:45,239
We should stay close
to the shoreline.

592
00:56:45,322 --> 00:56:46,823
There's no cover out here.

593
00:56:56,542 --> 00:56:58,669
They're swearing
as he was following us.

594
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,426
We're to die out here,
aren't we?

595
00:57:52,222 --> 00:57:53,682
I would rather fight
another demon

596
00:57:53,765 --> 00:57:56,143
than face any more
of this mountain.

597
00:57:56,226 --> 00:57:58,645
You may get your chance.

598
00:57:58,729 --> 00:58:00,397
We are forced at hand.

599
00:58:02,858 --> 00:58:05,319
What does he want?

600
00:58:05,402 --> 00:58:07,321
Revenge.

601
00:58:07,404 --> 00:58:08,947
What for?

602
00:58:09,031 --> 00:58:10,490
For sending him here.

603
00:58:25,797 --> 00:58:29,176
I expected more
from the slayer of the witch.

604
00:58:29,259 --> 00:58:32,554
You will find today
is full of disappointment.

605
00:58:32,638 --> 00:58:34,765
Here is my offer.

606
00:58:34,848 --> 00:58:37,184
Let us share the stones
together.

607
00:58:37,267 --> 00:58:40,938
We will kill the last lord
and we'll share the girl.

608
00:58:41,021 --> 00:58:44,566
And we will leave this hell.

609
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:46,527
You will have neither.

610
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:51,615
Give me the stone
and I will end this swiftly.

611
00:58:51,698 --> 00:58:54,785
Do you mind if we skip
to the fighting part?

612
00:58:54,868 --> 00:58:56,745
I'm quite cold.

613
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,498
So be it.

614
00:59:13,679 --> 00:59:15,430
Come on, Bhodie.

615
00:59:56,972 --> 00:59:59,308
Your brother isn't here
to save you this time.

616
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:04,980
I will take care of him
and the girl.

617
01:00:05,063 --> 01:00:06,064
And...

618
01:00:23,081 --> 01:00:26,043
Are you going to beg
for your life?

619
01:00:29,546 --> 01:00:30,756
Are you?

620
01:00:30,839 --> 01:00:31,632
Hey.

621
01:00:34,301 --> 01:00:36,261
What?

622
01:00:36,345 --> 01:00:37,679
No!

623
01:00:50,234 --> 01:00:51,777
Are you okay?

624
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:56,365
Yeah. I'm just resting
on this comfortable ice I found.

625
01:00:56,448 --> 01:00:58,575
You should try it.

626
01:00:58,659 --> 01:01:01,036
Can we stick
to the shoreline now?

627
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:02,621
Stick to the shoreline?

628
01:01:02,704 --> 01:01:04,331
Yes.

629
01:01:04,414 --> 01:01:05,958
But you go first.

630
01:01:25,853 --> 01:01:27,396
Avalon?

631
01:01:30,232 --> 01:01:32,109
You are troubled, my lord.

632
01:01:32,192 --> 01:01:35,362
Your brother sees her
as the savior of mankind.

633
01:01:35,445 --> 01:01:37,573
You've seen what she becomes.

634
01:01:37,656 --> 01:01:39,575
She's already betrayed you.

635
01:01:39,658 --> 01:01:42,619
What will stop her
from doing it again?

636
01:01:42,703 --> 01:01:47,916
You have betrayed yourself,
Knight of Light.

637
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,462
What trinket do you wear
around your neck?

638
01:01:52,546 --> 01:01:57,634
Remove it and reveal
yourself to me.

639
01:02:04,725 --> 01:02:06,059
You dream of me?

640
01:02:08,478 --> 01:02:10,480
Oh, you flatter yourself.

641
01:02:10,564 --> 01:02:11,815
You cry out my name.

642
01:02:13,317 --> 01:02:15,986
At first, I thought it was
for pleasure.

643
01:02:16,069 --> 01:02:18,071
But you are sweating blood.

644
01:02:18,155 --> 01:02:20,824
I wonder, what kind of dream
causes a man

645
01:02:20,908 --> 01:02:22,826
to bleed in his sleep.

646
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:26,038
The only thing I dream of
is leaving this hell.

647
01:02:27,623 --> 01:02:29,750
And you still think
you don't lie.

648
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:50,437
So you don't believe
in the light?

649
01:02:52,231 --> 01:02:54,107
I never said I don't
believe in the light.

650
01:02:55,692 --> 01:02:58,445
Do you think all things
were created by the light?

651
01:02:58,529 --> 01:03:00,614
In the beginning,
it was the light.

652
01:03:00,697 --> 01:03:03,283
And the light was with God
and the light was God.

653
01:03:03,367 --> 01:03:05,452
All things were made by Him.

654
01:03:05,536 --> 01:03:08,997
And without Him was not
anything made that was made.

655
01:03:09,081 --> 01:03:10,582
In Him was life.

656
01:03:10,666 --> 01:03:13,085
And life was the light of men.

657
01:03:13,168 --> 01:03:15,212
And the light shineth
in darkness.

658
01:03:15,295 --> 01:03:17,172
And darkness
comprehended it not.

659
01:03:19,383 --> 01:03:21,552
I know the ancient words.

660
01:03:21,635 --> 01:03:23,387
Yet you don't believe it.

661
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:25,013
Tell me.

662
01:03:25,097 --> 01:03:28,684
Where was the light through
all my suffering?

663
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:31,687
Where was the light when
your father left you a bastard?

664
01:03:33,689 --> 01:03:35,691
The light never made me
a bastard.

665
01:03:38,151 --> 01:03:40,195
And the light never brought you
your suffering.

666
01:03:41,572 --> 01:03:43,448
That was the choice of free men.

667
01:03:44,908 --> 01:03:47,327
Then you see.

668
01:03:47,411 --> 01:03:51,373
The light is no more powerful
than a common man's will.

669
01:03:51,456 --> 01:03:54,543
Why would I worship
such a weak being?

670
01:03:56,086 --> 01:04:00,090
The light is just another
demon pretending to be a god.

671
01:04:00,174 --> 01:04:03,844
Another monster that
needs to be chopped down.

672
01:04:03,927 --> 01:04:05,053
Maybe the light values

673
01:04:05,137 --> 01:04:07,931
free will more than
the absence of evil.

674
01:04:08,015 --> 01:04:10,559
Instead of making us
mindless slaves.

675
01:04:10,642 --> 01:04:13,061
He offers us free choice.

676
01:04:13,145 --> 01:04:14,605
Choices bring pain.

677
01:04:14,688 --> 01:04:16,064
They can also bring joy.

678
01:04:20,402 --> 01:04:23,614
If your master is so great.

679
01:04:23,697 --> 01:04:25,782
Then why are you wearing
another master's

680
01:04:25,866 --> 01:04:28,327
trinket around your neck?

681
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:30,204
Your words are empty.

682
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:45,112
Nephew.

683
01:05:45,195 --> 01:05:47,155
How are you here?

684
01:05:47,239 --> 01:05:49,199
This is glory, uncle.

685
01:05:49,283 --> 01:05:50,826
Bhodie.

686
01:05:50,909 --> 01:05:52,452
Have you passed over?

687
01:05:52,536 --> 01:05:54,079
Bhodie.

688
01:05:55,789 --> 01:05:57,833
Bhodie.

689
01:05:57,916 --> 01:05:59,168
There's nothing there.

690
01:06:06,592 --> 01:06:08,302
We must take the faster path.

691
01:06:11,263 --> 01:06:12,890
What you saw isn't real.

692
01:06:12,973 --> 01:06:14,016
You don't know what I saw.

693
01:06:14,099 --> 01:06:15,267
You are being deceived.

694
01:06:15,350 --> 01:06:16,185
It could be what's happening.

695
01:06:16,268 --> 01:06:17,186
It could be the future.

696
01:06:17,269 --> 01:06:20,230
Or it could be a trap.

697
01:06:20,314 --> 01:06:21,190
Move.

698
01:06:21,273 --> 01:06:22,482
No.

699
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,780
I will not let you sabotage
my quest.

700
01:06:28,864 --> 01:06:30,616
You mean your revenge.

701
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:40,334
I cannot live with myself
if I do not do

702
01:06:40,417 --> 01:06:43,504
all in my power to save
my nephew.

703
01:06:43,587 --> 01:06:45,547
And what if he's already dead?

704
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:48,091
And what if he isn't?

705
01:06:48,175 --> 01:06:49,676
We must take the faster path.

706
01:06:59,561 --> 01:07:01,438
Who's the boy?

707
01:07:01,522 --> 01:07:02,773
If we are going to die,

708
01:07:02,856 --> 01:07:05,442
I would like to know
who the boy is.

709
01:07:05,526 --> 01:07:07,653
I already said he's my nephew.

710
01:07:07,736 --> 01:07:10,322
And why is he so dear to you?

711
01:07:10,405 --> 01:07:12,032
Because he's my blood.

712
01:07:14,243 --> 01:07:16,161
And why do you laugh?

713
01:07:16,245 --> 01:07:18,705
Aren't we all family
somewhere down the line?

714
01:07:18,789 --> 01:07:21,583
Related in one way or another.

715
01:07:21,667 --> 01:07:24,294
We and our enemy share
a great-grandfather.

716
01:07:24,378 --> 01:07:27,047
Yet we still do horrific things
to each other.

717
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:30,050
Family.

718
01:07:30,133 --> 01:07:32,386
The Keeper told me about
your brother.

719
01:07:32,469 --> 01:07:34,972
I know you didn't choose
to come here.

720
01:07:35,055 --> 01:07:38,350
You were forced and betrayed
by your own family.

721
01:07:38,433 --> 01:07:39,810
Say too much.

722
01:07:39,893 --> 01:07:41,812
Family means nothing.

723
01:07:41,895 --> 01:07:44,231
Family always keeps
the greatest horse.

724
01:07:48,694 --> 01:07:49,903
Is that who's responsible

725
01:07:49,987 --> 01:07:52,447
for burning your friend
at the stake?

726
01:07:52,531 --> 01:07:53,949
An angry family member?

727
01:07:56,076 --> 01:07:59,788
Be careful what you say next,
bastard knight.

728
01:07:59,872 --> 01:08:01,456
Who was it?

729
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:02,624
A brother?

730
01:08:02,708 --> 01:08:03,917
A jealous uncle?

731
01:08:05,377 --> 01:08:08,046
An angry sister?

732
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:11,133
No, not your sister.

733
01:08:11,216 --> 01:08:13,635
So much hatred for men.

734
01:08:13,719 --> 01:08:16,430
Maybe it was your father.

735
01:08:23,645 --> 01:08:26,607
Now what had your mother done?

736
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:29,234
I'm guessing I'm not
the only bastard here, am I?

737
01:08:47,878 --> 01:08:50,297
Son of Azrael.

738
01:08:51,673 --> 01:08:56,261
You have entered through
the Forbidden Gate.

739
01:08:56,345 --> 01:09:02,935
Stand before me
and receive my judgment.

740
01:09:04,937 --> 01:09:07,481
I see you, Knight.

741
01:09:10,150 --> 01:09:13,570
How did you pass through
the Forbidden Gate?

742
01:09:15,239 --> 01:09:19,117
And why have you come?

743
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:39,763
There is another with you.

744
01:09:45,310 --> 01:09:47,396
Avalon.

745
01:09:47,479 --> 01:09:48,981
Daughter of Hope.

746
01:09:51,316 --> 01:09:55,070
How have you been
hidden from my sight?

747
01:09:56,864 --> 01:09:58,407
Wake up, Knight.

748
01:10:00,117 --> 01:10:02,035
I see.

749
01:10:02,119 --> 01:10:05,122
You are but a pawn
in a greater game.

750
01:10:12,963 --> 01:10:14,631
You reek of hate.

751
01:10:16,675 --> 01:10:18,635
Receive my judgment.

752
01:10:24,433 --> 01:10:26,143
Her heart is dark.

753
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:29,605
Her fate sealed.

754
01:10:29,688 --> 01:10:33,775
The wound will consume her.

755
01:10:33,859 --> 01:10:34,902
Be gone, Knight.

756
01:11:07,935 --> 01:11:09,978
Okay.

757
01:11:38,090 --> 01:11:39,091
I'm sorry.

758
01:11:40,759 --> 01:11:42,636
I should never have strayed
from the path.

759
01:11:46,056 --> 01:11:49,935
Knight, thank you.

760
01:11:52,479 --> 01:11:53,480
For what?

761
01:11:55,399 --> 01:11:56,817
For being here.

762
01:12:16,628 --> 01:12:17,963
Come.

763
01:12:18,046 --> 01:12:20,132
Let Avalon heal.

764
01:12:20,215 --> 01:12:23,218
The wound will consume her
if I don't intervene.

765
01:12:23,302 --> 01:12:24,761
This will slow the wound.

766
01:12:24,845 --> 01:12:27,472
The wound will consume her
if I don't intervene.

767
01:12:27,556 --> 01:12:29,975
This will slow the wound.

768
01:12:30,058 --> 01:12:31,977
I am a friend.

769
01:12:40,569 --> 01:12:43,197
You're cold, son of Azrael.

770
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,657
Warm yourself for your journey.

771
01:12:45,741 --> 01:12:47,784
Are you a demon?

772
01:12:47,868 --> 01:12:49,286
I am a friend.

773
01:12:51,872 --> 01:12:56,335
Like you, I was betrayed by
someone I loved.

774
01:12:57,544 --> 01:12:58,795
I would watch your words.

775
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:00,047
If the prophecy is true,

776
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:02,716
why did your brother
not come himself?

777
01:13:02,799 --> 01:13:05,385
Well, what is it that you want?

778
01:13:05,469 --> 01:13:07,721
How many times
have you died for her?

779
01:13:09,932 --> 01:13:12,017
And all she sees is a bastard.

780
01:13:13,477 --> 01:13:15,521
She doesn't even call you
by your name.

781
01:13:17,105 --> 01:13:19,358
Is that your bargain?

782
01:13:19,441 --> 01:13:20,609
You'll offer me comfort.

783
01:13:22,069 --> 01:13:24,571
No, Bhodie.

784
01:13:24,655 --> 01:13:25,906
No bargain.

785
01:13:27,074 --> 01:13:30,452
I offer you love.

786
01:13:30,536 --> 01:13:32,412
I don't desire your love.

787
01:13:32,496 --> 01:13:34,623
Then whose love do you desire?

788
01:13:38,085 --> 01:13:40,796
I want you.

789
01:13:40,879 --> 01:13:43,048
Not as the knight.

790
01:13:43,131 --> 01:13:45,509
Not as the bastard.

791
01:13:45,592 --> 01:13:47,261
But you, Bhodie.

792
01:13:49,054 --> 01:13:50,931
I will not bargain with you.

793
01:13:53,976 --> 01:13:55,602
Are those the words
of the Keeper?

794
01:13:57,062 --> 01:13:58,772
Or yours?

795
01:13:58,856 --> 01:14:00,858
Tell me, what do you know
of the Keeper?

796
01:14:02,150 --> 01:14:04,987
Do you know
why he wants to return?

797
01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:07,322
What his unfinished business is?

798
01:14:08,699 --> 01:14:11,368
Does one need a reason
to escape this hell?

799
01:14:14,454 --> 01:14:16,456
The bargain you made with him,
you know,

800
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:18,750
only two can enter the gate.

801
01:14:22,713 --> 01:14:27,092
Oh, you didn't know.

802
01:14:27,176 --> 01:14:29,803
Once you collect all the stones,
you are bound

803
01:14:29,887 --> 01:14:31,388
to take the Keeper.

804
01:14:31,471 --> 01:14:34,808
And if she, Avalon,
collects the stones,

805
01:14:34,892 --> 01:14:37,978
she is bound to take him.

806
01:14:38,061 --> 01:14:39,563
Bound by blood.

807
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,817
She didn't tell you, did she?

808
01:14:43,901 --> 01:14:45,694
That you labor in vain.

809
01:14:47,070 --> 01:14:50,324
That's why she can't say
your name.

810
01:14:50,407 --> 01:14:52,367
She's already betrayed you.

811
01:15:00,876 --> 01:15:04,630
And how do I know
it is not you who lies?

812
01:15:04,713 --> 01:15:07,132
You need my stone
to open the gate.

813
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,725
I've been here a long time.

814
01:15:18,936 --> 01:15:23,106
And it has taken me an eternity
to find just one stone.

815
01:15:23,190 --> 01:15:27,611
I want you to know that
it is you who I desire.

816
01:15:27,694 --> 01:15:33,367
And even though you refuse me,
I freely give myself to you.

817
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:37,663
No bargain, no tricks.

818
01:15:37,746 --> 01:15:42,459
All I ask is that you consider
what I'm about to tell you.

819
01:15:42,543 --> 01:15:44,753
The Invoker doesn't just have
the last stone,

820
01:15:44,837 --> 01:15:46,296
but also a weapon.

821
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:47,714
I know this already.

822
01:15:47,798 --> 01:15:52,803
A weapon powerful enough
to reshape the world.

823
01:15:52,886 --> 01:15:58,475
With it, you would be
the most powerful man

824
01:15:58,559 --> 01:16:00,352
in all of history.

825
01:16:00,435 --> 01:16:04,648
With it, you would be a god.

826
01:16:04,731 --> 01:16:07,818
And I, your queen.

827
01:16:07,901 --> 01:16:11,822
And together, we could reshape
and save the world of man.

828
01:16:11,905 --> 01:16:13,991
We could fix everything
the light

829
01:16:14,074 --> 01:16:16,493
and the gods have done.

830
01:16:16,577 --> 01:16:20,539
And why wouldn't I just let
Avalon take the sword?

831
01:16:20,622 --> 01:16:23,876
So she can take revenge.

832
01:16:23,959 --> 01:16:25,627
You've seen what happens
when she does.

833
01:16:27,045 --> 01:16:29,089
Take the sword.

834
01:16:29,173 --> 01:16:30,841
Deny the light.

835
01:16:30,924 --> 01:16:32,134
And kill the gods.

836
01:16:34,511 --> 01:16:35,971
Deny the light?

837
01:16:36,054 --> 01:16:38,807
To take the weapon,
you must deny the Light.

838
01:16:38,891 --> 01:16:41,727
The light allowed the gods
to bring evil into this world.

839
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:44,229
The light allows evil to exist

840
01:16:44,313 --> 01:16:48,192
and therefore, is as evil
as its creation.

841
01:16:48,275 --> 01:16:52,237
This is my sign of love to you.

842
01:16:53,906 --> 01:16:55,657
My commitment to you.

843
01:17:03,248 --> 01:17:08,003
All I desire is your love
in return.

844
01:17:09,463 --> 01:17:12,382
I said
I will not bargain with you.

845
01:17:17,471 --> 01:17:18,639
Have it your way.

846
01:17:33,070 --> 01:17:35,948
Are you feeling better?

847
01:17:36,031 --> 01:17:37,908
Yes, I am.

848
01:17:39,535 --> 01:17:41,328
How?

849
01:17:41,411 --> 01:17:43,038
When?

850
01:17:43,121 --> 01:17:45,165
Does it matter?

851
01:17:45,249 --> 01:17:47,835
How did you defeat
the second lord?

852
01:17:47,918 --> 01:17:49,169
I don't think I did.

853
01:17:51,922 --> 01:17:52,923
May I see it?

854
01:17:58,428 --> 01:18:00,514
We now have two of the stones.

855
01:18:00,597 --> 01:18:02,224
All we need is one more.

856
01:18:02,307 --> 01:18:04,434
And then we get to leave
here together.

857
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:10,232
Yes.

858
01:18:10,315 --> 01:18:11,483
Yes, together.

859
01:18:58,906 --> 01:19:01,491
Maybe I should go alone
for the rest of the journey.

860
01:19:01,575 --> 01:19:02,993
Alone?

861
01:19:03,076 --> 01:19:04,828
Why would we do that?

862
01:19:04,912 --> 01:19:06,705
I still have light
in my talisman.

863
01:19:06,788 --> 01:19:08,081
Let me finish this.

864
01:19:08,165 --> 01:19:11,627
You can't stand against
the Invoker alone, Knight.

865
01:19:13,128 --> 01:19:15,380
I know why you call me,
"Knight".

866
01:19:15,464 --> 01:19:16,632
You know nothing.

867
01:19:16,715 --> 01:19:18,175
I know what haunts you.

868
01:19:20,802 --> 01:19:22,346
Get to the point.

869
01:19:22,429 --> 01:19:23,388
I've seen you holding

870
01:19:23,472 --> 01:19:26,975
the corpse of a person
you dearly love.

871
01:19:27,059 --> 01:19:29,144
I know that this is why
you seek revenge.

872
01:19:29,228 --> 01:19:31,104
I'm losing interest
in this conversation.

873
01:19:31,188 --> 01:19:33,440
Let me be clear then.

874
01:19:33,524 --> 01:19:36,318
Even if we defeat the Invoker,
you will be offered

875
01:19:36,401 --> 01:19:38,028
a great power.

876
01:19:38,111 --> 01:19:40,614
A power that could reshape
this world.

877
01:19:40,697 --> 01:19:43,700
A power that could be
used for vengeance.

878
01:19:43,784 --> 01:19:45,327
Yes.

879
01:19:45,410 --> 01:19:48,330
And I will take that power.

880
01:19:48,413 --> 01:19:50,832
You'll damn your soul.

881
01:19:50,916 --> 01:19:52,209
In my dream--

882
01:19:52,292 --> 01:19:54,670
Oh, we're listening
to your dreams now?

883
01:19:54,753 --> 01:19:56,672
I saw you take the sword.

884
01:19:56,755 --> 01:19:58,257
I like this dream so far.

885
01:19:58,340 --> 01:20:00,175
And you were lost.

886
01:20:00,259 --> 01:20:02,469
You were consumed with darkness.

887
01:20:02,553 --> 01:20:04,638
Void of light.

888
01:20:04,721 --> 01:20:05,889
Is that it?

889
01:20:05,973 --> 01:20:07,933
You'll damn your soul.

890
01:20:08,016 --> 01:20:11,103
And with it, the prophecy dies.

891
01:20:11,186 --> 01:20:15,607
My father, he never heard
of your damn prophecy.

892
01:20:17,943 --> 01:20:19,319
"Witch.

893
01:20:19,403 --> 01:20:20,612
Whore.

894
01:20:20,696 --> 01:20:22,573
Burn her.

895
01:20:22,656 --> 01:20:24,658
Burn her!"

896
01:20:24,741 --> 01:20:28,537
I held my mother's hand
and listened to her scream

897
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:30,998
as her fingers melted
between mine.

898
01:20:31,081 --> 01:20:33,667
I wait for the fire
to consume me.

899
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:34,835
But I don't burn.

900
01:20:34,918 --> 01:20:36,378
I wish I did.

901
01:20:39,673 --> 01:20:42,843
I hold my mother's hand
until it turns to ash.

902
01:20:44,511 --> 01:20:49,433
When I return,
I will kill my father

903
01:20:49,516 --> 01:20:52,019
and burn his kingdom to ash.

904
01:20:55,189 --> 01:20:57,649
I am here for revenge.

905
01:20:58,817 --> 01:21:00,944
Not your prophecy.

906
01:21:06,491 --> 01:21:09,453
And I don't care if I lose
myself in doing so.

907
01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:16,001
We can bring your father's sin
to justice another way.

908
01:21:16,084 --> 01:21:18,837
But can your brother
and nephew wait?

909
01:21:18,921 --> 01:21:21,131
Men storm the gates.

910
01:21:21,215 --> 01:21:24,259
Your brother's life hangs
in the balance.

911
01:21:24,343 --> 01:21:26,970
He knew the risk.
That is why he stayed.

912
01:21:27,054 --> 01:21:28,222
That is his part.

913
01:21:28,305 --> 01:21:30,224
And what is my part?

914
01:21:30,307 --> 01:21:32,434
What will history
remember me for?

915
01:21:32,518 --> 01:21:36,188
For rising above hate
and choosing a better way.

916
01:21:36,271 --> 01:21:39,441
Not for your father
or your mother.

917
01:21:39,525 --> 01:21:41,693
But for yourself.

918
01:21:41,777 --> 01:21:43,278
So you're asking me to wait here

919
01:21:43,362 --> 01:21:45,989
while you retrieve
the final stone?

920
01:21:46,073 --> 01:21:47,866
Yes, I would.

921
01:21:47,950 --> 01:21:50,202
And if you can't beat
the Invoker,

922
01:21:50,285 --> 01:21:54,456
he will take your stone
and we will both be stuck here.

923
01:21:54,540 --> 01:21:55,916
What then?

924
01:21:55,999 --> 01:21:59,628
I will give you the stone
from the First Lady.

925
01:21:59,711 --> 01:22:01,171
That way it will be safe.

926
01:22:10,430 --> 01:22:13,767
You've been faithful
to your words so far.

927
01:22:13,851 --> 01:22:15,352
I will stay.

928
01:22:29,867 --> 01:22:31,910
I wish we would have
met sooner, Knight.

929
01:22:34,705 --> 01:22:35,873
No! Wait!

930
01:23:16,205 --> 01:23:19,166
William, you were wrong!

931
01:23:19,249 --> 01:23:20,501
You were wrong!

932
01:23:27,841 --> 01:23:30,719
I know not how to save you,
brother.

933
01:23:35,557 --> 01:23:38,268
Brother!

934
01:23:38,352 --> 01:23:40,103
Avenge me.

935
01:23:47,444 --> 01:23:48,862
There is no light here.

936
01:23:51,615 --> 01:23:53,158
There is only darkness.

937
01:24:08,507 --> 01:24:11,969
Even in the darkest moment,
there is hope.

938
01:24:38,954 --> 01:24:40,998
Son of Azrael,

939
01:24:42,833 --> 01:24:46,753
I have seen the deception
that has befallen you.

940
01:24:49,006 --> 01:24:54,136
Leave this place and return
to your brother's aid.

941
01:24:55,220 --> 01:24:57,764
I show you mercy.

942
01:24:57,848 --> 01:25:00,434
Take it before I change
my mind.

943
01:25:00,517 --> 01:25:02,769
Invoker, you will let me leave?

944
01:25:02,853 --> 01:25:05,606
I am not the Invoker.

945
01:25:05,689 --> 01:25:09,568
I am the keeper of this gate,
the guardian of this realm.

946
01:25:09,651 --> 01:25:12,487
I keep demons
and those who confer with demons

947
01:25:12,571 --> 01:25:14,364
from leaving this place.

948
01:25:14,448 --> 01:25:16,033
You are not the Invoker.

949
01:25:16,116 --> 01:25:20,746
No, and you're not a demon,
so you may leave.

950
01:25:20,829 --> 01:25:23,165
Tell me, where's Avalon?

951
01:25:23,248 --> 01:25:26,752
She is receiving her judgment.

952
01:25:30,214 --> 01:25:31,465
Bhodie, I--

953
01:25:31,548 --> 01:25:33,550
She conspired with demons

954
01:25:33,634 --> 01:25:37,262
to free the fallen
into your world.

955
01:25:37,346 --> 01:25:38,889
But I am bound to her.

956
01:25:38,972 --> 01:25:39,890
You need to leave.

957
01:25:39,973 --> 01:25:42,601
You are bound to a lie.

958
01:25:42,684 --> 01:25:44,394
Yet I am still bound.

959
01:25:44,478 --> 01:25:49,066
I took an oath, an oath
that I cannot break.

960
01:25:49,149 --> 01:25:52,653
Gatekeeper, I ask that you
allow her passage with me.

961
01:25:54,571 --> 01:25:56,823
She stays.

962
01:25:58,867 --> 01:26:00,035
Then so do I.

963
01:26:04,122 --> 01:26:05,874
So be it.

964
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:08,919
Bhodie, behind you!

965
01:26:19,596 --> 01:26:21,348
I want you to know,

966
01:26:22,599 --> 01:26:28,063
I take no joy
in your destruction.

967
01:27:16,653 --> 01:27:22,868
Did you really think you
could defeat me by yourself?

968
01:27:22,951 --> 01:27:24,536
What makes you think I'm alone?

969
01:27:59,196 --> 01:28:00,864
I want you to know,

970
01:28:00,948 --> 01:28:03,200
your destruction brings me
no joy.

971
01:28:26,139 --> 01:28:31,103
You, you're the final lord.

972
01:28:35,232 --> 01:28:40,821
Apologies for not introducing
myself properly.

973
01:28:56,336 --> 01:28:58,297
And how far back
does this lie go?

974
01:29:03,260 --> 01:29:06,054
Did you know I would follow you
through the Forbidden Gate?

975
01:29:06,138 --> 01:29:08,473
It wasn't meant for the bastard.

976
01:29:08,557 --> 01:29:11,727
Your brother, William,
was meant to follow.

977
01:29:11,810 --> 01:29:13,437
I underestimated his cowardice.

978
01:29:14,897 --> 01:29:17,024
You're lying.

979
01:29:17,107 --> 01:29:19,276
I fed your brother

980
01:29:19,359 --> 01:29:23,155
and your father stories
of the prophecy.

981
01:29:27,159 --> 01:29:28,952
The chosen one,

982
01:29:30,662 --> 01:29:34,499
their blind faith was
so easily manipulated.

983
01:29:42,257 --> 01:29:45,135
Like I said, Knight,
you are out of your depth.

984
01:29:47,513 --> 01:29:50,098
There is no prophecy,
there never was.

985
01:29:51,767 --> 01:29:54,394
Now you will do whatever you can
to escape this hell.

986
01:29:57,356 --> 01:30:01,652
Take the sword
and strike him down.

987
01:30:13,497 --> 01:30:16,083
A prophecy isn't a lie,
it's a choice.

988
01:30:17,292 --> 01:30:19,211
The choice of who you will be.

989
01:30:20,420 --> 01:30:23,799
A choice everyone must make.

990
01:30:23,882 --> 01:30:26,885
If you take that sword,
your father wins,

991
01:30:26,969 --> 01:30:28,095
you'll become just like him.

992
01:30:30,472 --> 01:30:31,765
What is her other option?

993
01:30:35,143 --> 01:30:39,398
To be like her mother,
helpless,

994
01:30:42,109 --> 01:30:43,652
and burned at the stake?

995
01:31:00,752 --> 01:31:02,004
Avalon.

996
01:31:10,179 --> 01:31:11,263
Avalon.

997
01:31:19,313 --> 01:31:20,731
I don't want to.

998
01:31:24,568 --> 01:31:25,694
Then don't.

999
01:31:27,279 --> 01:31:29,698
You don't need it.

1000
01:31:29,781 --> 01:31:32,326
If only two may pass,
then I will stay behind.

1001
01:31:33,619 --> 01:31:35,245
No.

1002
01:31:35,329 --> 01:31:36,788
No, you will not.

1003
01:31:38,540 --> 01:31:41,126
You look at me and see
something that isn't there.

1004
01:31:41,210 --> 01:31:43,045
I see you.

1005
01:31:43,128 --> 01:31:46,924
I see your hurt, your pain,
your anger.

1006
01:31:47,007 --> 01:31:48,634
Yet I know you will rise
above it.

1007
01:31:50,260 --> 01:31:53,764
I know only two may pass,
let me stay behind.

1008
01:31:55,182 --> 01:31:56,308
Then it's settled.

1009
01:31:58,310 --> 01:31:59,603
The boy will stay.

1010
01:32:01,772 --> 01:32:05,567
Take the sword and let us leave.

1011
01:32:21,834 --> 01:32:23,043
Take the sword.

1012
01:32:25,337 --> 01:32:26,421
No.

1013
01:32:31,218 --> 01:32:33,178
What do you mean no?

1014
01:32:33,262 --> 01:32:35,222
I said, no.

1015
01:32:41,103 --> 01:32:48,026
After all I've--
after all I've done,

1016
01:32:51,572 --> 01:32:53,198
I will not be denied.

1017
01:32:55,075 --> 01:32:57,202
I am choosing a different path.

1018
01:32:59,371 --> 01:33:01,206
A different path.

1019
01:33:01,290 --> 01:33:02,416
I don't think so.

1020
01:33:03,959 --> 01:33:05,919
I underestimated you, Knight.

1021
01:33:06,003 --> 01:33:08,547
You found the last bit of
humanity left in Avalon.

1022
01:33:08,630 --> 01:33:11,425
After I'm done with you,
there will be none left.

1023
01:33:22,019 --> 01:33:23,270
Avalon?

1024
01:33:27,107 --> 01:33:29,484
Mother.

1025
01:33:29,568 --> 01:33:30,986
Take my hand, Avalon.

1026
01:33:43,081 --> 01:33:44,666
Don't you remember your promise?

1027
01:33:47,252 --> 01:33:48,629
Avenge me, Avalon.

1028
01:33:51,215 --> 01:33:52,716
Avalon, avenge me.

1029
01:33:54,635 --> 01:33:56,220
Avenge me, Avalon.

1030
01:33:58,639 --> 01:34:01,058
Avalon, avenge me.

1031
01:34:01,141 --> 01:34:02,226
Burn.

1032
01:34:02,309 --> 01:34:04,311
Avenge me, Avalon!

1033
01:34:04,394 --> 01:34:06,730
-Burn the witch.
-Avenge me, Avalon!

1034
01:34:06,813 --> 01:34:07,773
Burn!

1035
01:34:07,856 --> 01:34:09,399
Avenge.

1036
01:34:27,042 --> 01:34:31,171
We are bound, you and I
by a hundred deaths.

1037
01:34:31,255 --> 01:34:32,506
Bound by blood.

1038
01:34:34,299 --> 01:34:36,802
Each death brought us
closer together.

1039
01:34:36,885 --> 01:34:38,428
Each death made us one.

1040
01:34:39,638 --> 01:34:42,474
Through each passing,

1041
01:34:42,558 --> 01:34:44,852
we draw closer.

1042
01:34:44,935 --> 01:34:46,979
Our spirits will merge as one.

1043
01:34:47,980 --> 01:34:50,649
I can endure.

1044
01:34:50,732 --> 01:34:51,733
But can she?

1045
01:34:53,652 --> 01:34:54,528
You didn't really think

1046
01:34:54,611 --> 01:34:56,572
you were the chosen one,
did you?

1047
01:34:59,575 --> 01:35:02,703
There's nothing special
about you.

1048
01:35:10,502 --> 01:35:12,171
Do you intend to strike me down?

1049
01:35:16,967 --> 01:35:17,885
No!

1050
01:35:29,188 --> 01:35:32,316
One of you will take the sword.

1051
01:35:35,777 --> 01:35:37,821
Take the sword.

1052
01:35:37,905 --> 01:35:39,448
If not for you, for her.

1053
01:35:42,367 --> 01:35:44,536
You promised
you would protect me.

1054
01:35:44,620 --> 01:35:46,955
- Take the sword.
- Take the sword.

1055
01:35:47,039 --> 01:35:49,625
Without the sword, you are
forever a bastard,

1056
01:35:49,708 --> 01:35:50,959
forever a prisoner.

1057
01:35:51,043 --> 01:35:53,378
You will pass
from this world unknown,

1058
01:35:53,462 --> 01:35:56,173
unheard of, and unloved.

1059
01:35:56,256 --> 01:36:00,177
But with the sword,
you could conquer all.

1060
01:36:00,260 --> 01:36:03,055
A god among men.

1061
01:36:03,138 --> 01:36:05,224
You said you would protect me,
Uncle.

1062
01:36:06,558 --> 01:36:07,643
Take the sword.

1063
01:36:07,726 --> 01:36:09,686
All honor will be yours,

1064
01:36:09,770 --> 01:36:12,481
even your brother will bow
to you.

1065
01:36:12,564 --> 01:36:13,941
Avalon will be yours.

1066
01:36:14,024 --> 01:36:14,900
Take the sword.

1067
01:36:16,401 --> 01:36:18,779
Take the sword, Uncle.

1068
01:36:18,862 --> 01:36:21,198
Take the sword.

1069
01:36:23,534 --> 01:36:25,118
Take the sword.

1070
01:36:25,202 --> 01:36:26,828
Take the sword.

1071
01:36:28,789 --> 01:36:30,541
Take the sword.

1072
01:36:30,624 --> 01:36:32,668
Take the sword.

1073
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:36,588
I am the Great Invoker.

1074
01:36:38,006 --> 01:36:42,553
I weave and shape humanity
to suit my desires.

1075
01:36:44,221 --> 01:36:49,726
The mere whisper of my voice
commands the masses.

1076
01:36:49,810 --> 01:36:51,812
I will be yours.

1077
01:36:51,895 --> 01:36:54,106
Come, be with me, Bhodie.

1078
01:36:54,189 --> 01:36:56,108
Take the sword.

1079
01:36:56,191 --> 01:36:57,901
It was I.

1080
01:36:57,985 --> 01:37:00,654
I who commanded her father
to burn her.

1081
01:37:03,407 --> 01:37:04,533
"Witch!

1082
01:37:04,616 --> 01:37:05,951
Burn!"

1083
01:37:06,034 --> 01:37:07,703
These are my words!

1084
01:37:12,624 --> 01:37:14,334
You are my puppet.

1085
01:37:15,627 --> 01:37:17,462
I am the puppet master.

1086
01:37:17,546 --> 01:37:19,131
You are nothing!

1087
01:37:22,759 --> 01:37:23,760
Deny the light.

1088
01:37:23,844 --> 01:37:24,761
Love me.

1089
01:37:24,845 --> 01:37:25,804
Deny the light.

1090
01:37:25,888 --> 01:37:27,055
Worship me.

1091
01:37:27,139 --> 01:37:28,056
Deny the light.

1092
01:37:28,140 --> 01:37:29,099
Deny the light.

1093
01:37:29,183 --> 01:37:30,309
Deny the light.

1094
01:37:30,392 --> 01:37:31,435
Deny the light.

1095
01:37:31,518 --> 01:37:32,853
Deny the light.

1096
01:37:33,937 --> 01:37:35,814
I own you!

1097
01:37:42,821 --> 01:37:44,323
Take the sword.

1098
01:37:47,034 --> 01:37:48,160
No.

1099
01:38:08,055 --> 01:38:09,348
But do you burn?

1100
01:39:43,233 --> 01:39:44,610
Are you all right?

1101
01:39:48,947 --> 01:39:50,741
He took everything from me.

1102
01:39:55,871 --> 01:39:59,708
After so long,
walking down that path,

1103
01:39:59,791 --> 01:40:01,126
I don't know where to go.

1104
01:40:07,925 --> 01:40:09,301
Where do I go?

1105
01:40:12,471 --> 01:40:13,722
Through the gate.

1106
01:40:15,557 --> 01:40:16,808
And after that?

1107
01:40:18,519 --> 01:40:21,730
Whatever it is,
we'll do it together.

1108
01:40:40,207 --> 01:40:42,459
Together.

1109
01:40:42,543 --> 01:40:44,461
Yes, together.

1110
01:41:37,723 --> 01:41:38,932
Come, brother.

1111
01:41:39,016 --> 01:41:40,851
Let us fulfill the prophecy.
