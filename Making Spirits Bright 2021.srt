00:00:10,266 --> 00:00:13,633
(upbeat Christmas music)

6
00:00:35,967 --> 00:00:37,033
- Oh yes. Great.

7
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:39,000
Those will go in the
dining room. Thank you.

8
00:00:41,367 --> 00:00:42,667
(movers chattering)

9
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,800
Hm.

10
00:00:51,266 --> 00:00:52,600
(bells chiming)

11
00:00:52,734 --> 00:00:54,967
- At Upstage we need to
accentuate the selling points

12
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,700
of the home to entice the
widest array of buyers.

13
00:00:57,834 --> 00:01:00,734
We're the last stage you'll
have before selling your home.

14
00:01:00,867 --> 00:01:02,767
This is Grace Ryan,
my partner in design

15
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,800
and the other half of Upstaged.

16
00:01:04,934 --> 00:01:06,467
- Nice to meet you.

17
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,433
I hope you're okay we moved
the Paola Buffa side table.

18
00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:11,500
It was hidden in that guest
room and we really thought it

19
00:01:11,633 --> 00:01:14,500
would bring the dining
room that wow-factor.

20
00:01:14,633 --> 00:01:16,333
- The buffa what?

21
00:01:16,467 --> 00:01:20,000
- The walnut side table
handmade by one of the premier

22
00:01:20,133 --> 00:01:22,767
European furniture makers
of the 20th century.

23
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:27,400
The brown table with
the ridged drawers

24
00:01:27,533 --> 00:01:28,900
and the brass handles.

25
00:01:29,033 --> 00:01:31,633
- Oh that. I mostly keep my
workout clothes on it anyway.

26
00:01:31,767 --> 00:01:34,633
- Oh, you keep your workout
clothes on a Paola Buffa.

27
00:01:34,767 --> 00:01:35,967
- Well the treadmills
in there, ha,

28
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,300
never liked the look
of it, to be honest.

29
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:40,266
- Can you excuse us
for just a moment?

30
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,133
Take a look around and let
me know how you like the rest

31
00:01:42,266 --> 00:01:43,233
of the house.

32
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,233
Putting the Buffa on the
dining room was a bold choice.

33
00:01:49,367 --> 00:01:53,266
Now that is see it, it's
a little loud, isn't it?

34
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,133
- I thought it gave the
room a pop of style.

35
00:01:56,266 --> 00:01:58,467
- Perhaps it's more
like an explosion.

36
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,467
- Right.

37
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,633
- We want people
talking about the room,

38
00:02:00,767 --> 00:02:01,834
not the table, right?

39
00:02:01,967 --> 00:02:03,467
- Yes. I will get them
over to switch it out.

40
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,734
- And while they're at it,

41
00:02:04,867 --> 00:02:06,767
let's ask them to switch
the artwork in the den.

42
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,900
- Oh, really?

43
00:02:08,033 --> 00:02:10,567
I was really digging
those old French adverts

44
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,867
that fit in there.

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,867
- You don't think it looks
a little too nineties?

46
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,467
I almost forgot, the
producers called.

47
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,300
- Really? What,
what did they say?

48
00:02:20,433 --> 00:02:22,033
- They want to sit with
us after the holidays,

49
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:25,000
talking through our vision
for a home staging show.

50
00:02:25,133 --> 00:02:26,433
- That's amazing.

51
00:02:26,567 --> 00:02:28,467
- Said we make a dynamic duo.

52
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,467
This could be huge for
us, for our company.

53
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,066
Our own TV show,
Grace. Think about it.

54
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,734
Listen, I'll finish up here.

55
00:02:36,867 --> 00:02:38,667
I'm sure your family's
eager to have you at home.

56
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,734
- Are you sure?

57
00:02:39,867 --> 00:02:42,467
- Definitely. Go, I got this.

58
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,734
Actually, before you go,

59
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:49,500
think we can move that
back to where it was?

60
00:02:49,633 --> 00:02:51,700
- Yes. Of course. I'm on it.

61
00:02:53,066 --> 00:02:55,300
(sighs)

62
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:57,934
(gentle music)

63
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:07,100
(engine revving)
(tires spinning)

64
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:08,667
Looks like someone
needs some help.

65
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,767
(engine revving)
(tires spinning)

66
00:03:15,967 --> 00:03:18,467
Oh.

67
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,300
Yep, I think you're stuck.

68
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:23,500
Tony Scotto.

69
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:25,400
- Grace Ryan.

70
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:27,533
Wow. It has been-

71
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:28,834
- It's been a while.
- Yeah.

72
00:03:28,967 --> 00:03:31,200
- Yeah. What happened here?

73
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,700
- Oh, this is deer darted
out and I did what I could

74
00:03:33,834 --> 00:03:35,600
to avoid it, but here we are.

75
00:03:35,734 --> 00:03:37,867
- Well they probably thought
they saw their cousin back here

76
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,333
and got excited.

77
00:03:39,467 --> 00:03:41,300
- (laughs) Good one.

78
00:03:41,433 --> 00:03:42,400
Very good.

79
00:03:42,533 --> 00:03:44,000
- Couldn't help myself. (laughs)

80
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:46,200
Actually, do you have
some rubber mats in there?

81
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,033
- Yeah. Why?

82
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,900
- Hand them over?
I'll show you a trick.

83
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:55,500
Aha. Perfect.

84
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:56,734
Ready?

85
00:03:56,867 --> 00:03:58,600
Hop in. Get ready
to give it some gas.

86
00:03:58,734 --> 00:04:00,166
- Okay.
- There we go.

87
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,033
That should give you some
traction. Try it now.

88
00:04:04,533 --> 00:04:11,233
(engine revving)

89
00:04:11,367 --> 00:04:12,767
All right.
- Hey.

90
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,800
That's a pretty great trick.

91
00:04:14,934 --> 00:04:16,600
Thanks for coming to my rescue.

92
00:04:16,734 --> 00:04:17,867
- Eh. It's the Girl Scout in me.

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I can't help myself.
Now it's all yours.

94
00:04:20,133 --> 00:04:22,333
You can unstick
yourself anytime.

95
00:04:22,467 --> 00:04:24,233
- Any advice if I get a flat?

96
00:04:24,367 --> 00:04:26,133
- Yeah. Call AAA.

97
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,166
(both laughing)

98
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,433
(phone ringing)

99
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:30,433
Oh.

100
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:32,266
Um, I'm sorry. I
should take this.

101
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,767
- No, that's okay.

102
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,800
I should get going too,
but thanks for your help.

103
00:04:35,934 --> 00:04:39,200
And it was a nice
to see you again.

104
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:40,300
- Nice to see you.

105
00:04:41,367 --> 00:04:43,200
- Happy holidays.
- You too.

106
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:46,033
Oh, don't forget your map.
- Oh, right.

107
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,266
- Hey Sarah. What's up?

108
00:04:48,834 --> 00:04:50,200
Oh, okay.

109
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,700
So you're not feeling the look
of the living room anymore.

110
00:04:54,033 --> 00:04:57,233
Got it. Yeah. Okay. I'll
be there in a minute.

111
00:05:03,734 --> 00:05:07,266
- Pop. Come on. Still
with the icicles?

112
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,700
- Hey, it's a Christmas classic.

113
00:05:09,834 --> 00:05:11,200
They take time.

114
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,300
You got to give the
people what they want.

115
00:05:13,433 --> 00:05:14,734
- You know what the people want?

116
00:05:14,867 --> 00:05:16,700
The people want their Christmas
decorations by Christmas,

117
00:05:16,834 --> 00:05:17,734
not Valentine's day.

118
00:05:17,867 --> 00:05:19,233
That's what the people want.

119
00:05:19,367 --> 00:05:22,166
- Your father will be up all
night if it's not perfect.

120
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,767
And if he's up all
night, I'm up all night.

121
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,800
Just let him do what he
needs to do for my sake.

122
00:05:27,934 --> 00:05:29,300
- Where do you want these, Dad?

123
00:05:29,433 --> 00:05:32,000
- Oh, well the lights on the
trees are going to pull focus.

124
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:35,400
So we need to balance out
the lawn, frame the house.

125
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,333
Put them right there.

126
00:05:38,467 --> 00:05:39,800
- Here?
- Yes. Perfect.

127
00:05:41,567 --> 00:05:43,233
Thank you.
- You got it.

128
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:47,200
- Hey,

129
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,133
whatever happened to that
marketing job you applied for?

130
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,700
- Same thing that
always happens.

131
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:52,934
It was a pleasure to meet me,

132
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:55,200
but they decided to
go with somebody else.

133
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,567
- Something will workout.

134
00:05:59,633 --> 00:06:00,667
- Oh. Oh. (groans)

135
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,800
- Oh! Are you
okay? Are you okay?

136
00:06:01,934 --> 00:06:02,834
- Ah. Yeah. Yeah.

137
00:06:02,967 --> 00:06:04,033
I'm good. I'm good.
- Okay. Just watch it.

138
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,066
- Slow, slow.

139
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,600
You know,

140
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,834
we should start charging by
the day instead of the job.

141
00:06:09,967 --> 00:06:12,900
How many houses have
we done this year, six?

142
00:06:13,033 --> 00:06:15,000
- Yep. And we did
eight last year.

143
00:06:15,133 --> 00:06:18,066
- We used to do 20
houses a year at least.

144
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,166
His numbers have really
taken a nose-dive ever since

145
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,433
he stopped competing in
the Bright Nights contest.

146
00:06:22,567 --> 00:06:26,100
- Talk to him. See if he's
ready to compete again.

147
00:06:26,233 --> 00:06:28,600
The deadline to
submit is tonight.

148
00:06:28,734 --> 00:06:30,700
All we have to do is
drop the application off

149
00:06:30,834 --> 00:06:32,200
at the Christmas Fest.

150
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,133
- Why do I have to do it?
Couldn't we do it together?

151
00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:36,667
- No. You're the oldest.

152
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,133
I gotta pick Dante up at hockey.

153
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:41,200
You got this.
- Mm.

154
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,000
- I'm heading out.

155
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:44,266
- Oh, I want to go with you.

156
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,867
I got a few things to pick up.

157
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:48,667
All right. Well we're
far enough along.

158
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,166
You two can finish by yourself.

159
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,367
- Sure we can.

160
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,934
- We'll be back in an hour.

161
00:06:53,066 --> 00:06:54,433
- Bye.
- Bye.

162
00:06:55,967 --> 00:06:57,500
- Well, guess we'd
better get a move on

163
00:06:57,633 --> 00:07:01,433
so we can finish before
the family gets back.

164
00:07:06,567 --> 00:07:08,133
(people clapping)

165
00:07:08,266 --> 00:07:09,400
- Thank you. Thank you.

166
00:07:09,533 --> 00:07:11,333
Means a lot.

167
00:07:11,467 --> 00:07:16,000
From my family to
yours, Merry Christmas.

168
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:20,800
(people chattering)

169
00:07:20,934 --> 00:07:22,433
- Looks amazing, Pop.

170
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,200
- I should have brought
two more reindeer.

171
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:28,233
- Let it go, Dad.
Just let it go.

172
00:07:28,367 --> 00:07:29,834
- Okay.

173
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,333
- I sanded the whole thing down,

174
00:07:34,467 --> 00:07:36,767
patched up all the dings and
nicks and stained it back

175
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,333
to its original color.

176
00:07:38,467 --> 00:07:41,133
- My wife used to nurse
her son in this chair.

177
00:07:41,266 --> 00:07:44,000
Now he just had his first and
we wanted to pass it down.

178
00:07:44,133 --> 00:07:46,567
- Well, it should hold up for
a couple more generations.

179
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,233
- It's beautiful, Bill.

180
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:50,266
Was glad to see your
lights still on.

181
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,300
Heard rumor you might be
closing the stores down.

182
00:07:53,433 --> 00:07:55,033
- (laughs) That's a long...

183
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,500
No plans to yet anyway.

184
00:07:56,633 --> 00:07:59,166
- [Customer] I see you're still
in the decorating business.

185
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,166
Noticed your yard signs around.

186
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,667
- Yeah, that's right.

187
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,500
Geared up for the Bright
Nights contest again, too.

188
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:07,400
You know, going up against all
those professional decorators

189
00:08:07,533 --> 00:08:10,300
in town,
mm, keeps on your toes.

190
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:11,667
- Good luck.

191
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,166
Well, thank you very much.

192
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,633
Now, Larry upfront will
ring you out and help you

193
00:08:14,767 --> 00:08:16,533
to the car with it, okay?

194
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:17,533
There you go.

195
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:19,133
- Hi, Dad.

196
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:20,633
- Hey, kiddo!

197
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:21,867
- Aww.

198
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,200
- So nice to have
you home this year.

199
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,433
You know, you've
been gone so long

200
00:08:25,567 --> 00:08:28,133
and your nephew Evan's
got his license now.

201
00:08:28,266 --> 00:08:29,700
- (laughs) Okay, first of
all, you need to let it go

202
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:32,900
that I went on holiday vacation
someplace warm for once.

203
00:08:33,033 --> 00:08:34,834
You should try it some time.

204
00:08:34,967 --> 00:08:37,200
And second, I know how to count.

205
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,934
Evan is only nine.

206
00:08:39,066 --> 00:08:40,367
- Ten.

207
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,734
- Oh right. November
9th, of course.

208
00:08:42,867 --> 00:08:44,233
- (laughs) Come on.

209
00:08:44,367 --> 00:08:45,800
- Your mom and Evan
are in the back.

210
00:08:45,934 --> 00:08:48,300
- Oh, I saw a Paolo
Buffa side table today.

211
00:08:48,433 --> 00:08:49,667
It was a thing of beauty.

212
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,333
- Really? Tell me all about it.

213
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,600
- Hey! There's my girl.

214
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,000
- Aunt Grace!

215
00:08:56,133 --> 00:08:59,600
- Evan! What's new, kid?
Grandpa says you're driving now.

216
00:08:59,734 --> 00:09:01,367
- No, not yet.
- Not yet.

217
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,900
- With your sister and her
husband working so much overtime

218
00:09:04,033 --> 00:09:05,333
right now,

219
00:09:05,467 --> 00:09:07,033
Evan has offered to help
with Bright Nights this year.

220
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:10,834
- Good man. Speaking
of which, here you go.

221
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,600
Yeah.

222
00:09:13,734 --> 00:09:14,834
- What do we got here?

223
00:09:14,967 --> 00:09:17,200
- Photos of the house
we decorated this year.

224
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,800
What do you think?

225
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:20,934
Just narrowing
down my submission.

226
00:09:21,066 --> 00:09:22,934
- Right.

227
00:09:23,066 --> 00:09:24,800
Some of these sort of
remind me of the designs

228
00:09:24,934 --> 00:09:26,400
from a few years ago,

229
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:28,934
except you subbed the
snowflakes for the candy canes.

230
00:09:29,066 --> 00:09:30,767
What?

231
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,400
- We're getting stale.
- No.

232
00:09:32,533 --> 00:09:34,333
- Yep, like January gingerbread.

233
00:09:34,467 --> 00:09:36,667
- Now I wouldn't
say that, it just...

234
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,533
It never hurts to push
the creative edges, right?

235
00:09:39,667 --> 00:09:41,333
- Well, what we may
lack in variety,

236
00:09:41,467 --> 00:09:43,667
we make up for in volume.

237
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,266
I mean, how many houses
did we do this season, 30?

238
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,467
30, right?

239
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,667
- Something like that.

240
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,133
- Oh.

241
00:09:50,266 --> 00:09:52,667
- Oh, here you go. These
should be your submissions.

242
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,600
- I wanna see.
- Okay.

243
00:09:54,734 --> 00:09:56,700
- Ooh.
- What do you think?

244
00:09:56,834 --> 00:09:58,266
- Yeah?

245
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,967
Okay. Let's get this
application into the committee.

246
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,200
- You know, we really
need your spark, dear.

247
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,767
It's what all of our
designs are missing.

248
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,033
- Oh.

249
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,300
- I mean, you could
be our saving grace.

250
00:10:10,433 --> 00:10:11,333
- Oh. (laughs)

251
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:12,400
Oh, Bill.

252
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:14,633
- What?
- Talk about stale.

253
00:10:14,767 --> 00:10:15,967
(laughing)

254
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,333
Come on, kiddo.

255
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,266
- I wanted to talk to
you about Good Tidings.

256
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,767
- What about it?

257
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,567
- Well, I know how you like
to take a lot of time off

258
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,500
from contracting during the
holidays to focus on decorating,

259
00:10:27,633 --> 00:10:29,900
but with the number of clients
being what they'd been the

260
00:10:30,033 --> 00:10:31,100
last couple of years,

261
00:10:31,233 --> 00:10:32,133
you're losing a lot
more than you're making.

262
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:33,867
- No, stop. Stop here.
- What?

263
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:37,567
- What is this?

264
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,300
- Is that the Inglid's house?

265
00:10:39,433 --> 00:10:40,834
- It is.

266
00:10:40,967 --> 00:10:42,533
- They've been a
customer of yours for...

267
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:44,800
- 10 years.

268
00:10:44,934 --> 00:10:48,233
- Guess they decided to go a
different direction this year.

269
00:10:48,367 --> 00:10:49,834
- I guess they did.

270
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,667
What the heck is GlowScapes?

271
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,767
- I think we're looking at it.

272
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,400
- Popular, by the looks of it.

273
00:10:58,633 --> 00:11:00,100
- Looks like it's
easy to set up too.

274
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:02,567
I bet you could do a few of
those in one day, no problem.

275
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,433
- Anybody can string
up a bunch of lights

276
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:07,033
and enter a computer code.

277
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,367
Where's the soul in that?

278
00:11:09,467 --> 00:11:10,433
The heart?

279
00:11:10,567 --> 00:11:11,800
Do you see the people's faces

280
00:11:11,934 --> 00:11:14,100
when I flip the light switch on,

281
00:11:14,233 --> 00:11:16,600
that spark of joy in their eyes?

282
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:22,166
All because of
something we've created.

283
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,166
I mean, it's-

284
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,300
- Magical.
- It is.

285
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,300
- I know.

286
00:11:25,433 --> 00:11:26,934
And I love how it lights you up.

287
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,700
But without the bump
from Bright Nights,

288
00:11:30,834 --> 00:11:33,567
Good Tidings is becoming more
of a hobby than a business.

289
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,033
- It's not always
about the money.

290
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,700
- I know, but why don't
you show the people

291
00:11:37,834 --> 00:11:39,700
of this town what
you're capable of?

292
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:44,800
There's a reason you won
the first five Bright Nights
contests.

293
00:11:44,934 --> 00:11:46,000
- I don't think so.

294
00:11:46,133 --> 00:11:48,834
- Dad, come on.

295
00:11:48,967 --> 00:11:51,533
- I haven't competed
in eight years.

296
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:54,100
And you remember what
happened last time?

297
00:11:54,233 --> 00:11:55,367
- Yeah, sure.

298
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,166
You ran out of time.
You got disqualified.

299
00:11:59,567 --> 00:12:04,600
But so what, that's not
going to happen this time.

300
00:12:04,734 --> 00:12:06,934
I'm going to be there and
Mom's going to be there

301
00:12:07,066 --> 00:12:08,300
and Maria is going to be there.

302
00:12:08,433 --> 00:12:09,800
- Really?

303
00:12:09,934 --> 00:12:12,233
- Yes. Maria said she'd help
fill out the application.

304
00:12:12,367 --> 00:12:15,233
We can get it to the committee
before registration closes.

305
00:12:16,467 --> 00:12:19,100
You're the best in town, Pop.

306
00:12:19,233 --> 00:12:21,166
I mean, it says it right
there on your signs.

307
00:12:27,734 --> 00:12:29,000
- Okay.

308
00:12:29,133 --> 00:12:30,800
- Yeah?
- Let's do it.

309
00:12:30,934 --> 00:12:32,734
- Okay.
- Okay.

310
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:36,100
(engine starting)

311
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,667
(bells jingling)

312
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,567
(people chattering)

313
00:12:55,033 --> 00:12:57,834
- So we staged the
home of this producer

314
00:12:57,967 --> 00:13:00,834
and they got a kick out of us,

315
00:13:00,967 --> 00:13:04,600
thought that we made a charming
team, their words, not mine.

316
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,834
Anyway, they said that
we'd make a fun host

317
00:13:08,967 --> 00:13:10,667
for a home staging show.

318
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,200
- Oh.
- I know.

319
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,100
Anyway, we're going to talk to
them in the new year about it

320
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:15,567
and we'll see what happens.

321
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,233
- That is incredible, Grace.

322
00:13:17,367 --> 00:13:19,133
- Yeah. Yeah. It is just...

323
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:22,100
- What?

324
00:13:22,233 --> 00:13:23,834
- Sarah and I have been
on different pages lately,

325
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:26,500
just completely out of sync.

326
00:13:26,633 --> 00:13:29,433
- Being friends and
business partners

327
00:13:29,567 --> 00:13:31,967
takes a delicate touch.

328
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,400
Ask your father.

329
00:13:33,533 --> 00:13:35,333
He still avoids every
street with a house designed

330
00:13:35,467 --> 00:13:37,200
by the Scottos. (laughs)

331
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,300
- Yeah, well you'd think 20
years would be enough time

332
00:13:39,433 --> 00:13:40,800
for bygones to be bygones.

333
00:13:40,934 --> 00:13:43,033
- Ha ha. Not a chance.

334
00:13:44,633 --> 00:13:45,867
- Did you ask Santa
for what you wanted?

335
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,400
- A Secrets of the Great
Magicians magic set.

336
00:13:49,533 --> 00:13:52,867
- Oh, so you're into magic
these days. That's pretty cool.

337
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,066
- Lean down, Aunt Grace.

338
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,400
- Okay.

339
00:13:56,533 --> 00:13:57,734
What've we got here?

340
00:13:57,867 --> 00:14:01,033
Okay. Oh boy. Starting out good.

341
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,900
Whoa! That is
incredible. Nicely done.

342
00:14:09,033 --> 00:14:11,300
Okay, now can you do that
with a chicken sandwich

343
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:12,433
because I am starving.

344
00:14:12,567 --> 00:14:13,500
- I can't, Aunt Grace.

345
00:14:13,633 --> 00:14:15,300
- You let me down, kid.

346
00:14:15,433 --> 00:14:16,500
All right.

347
00:14:16,633 --> 00:14:18,000
Well, I'm going to
grab something to eat,

348
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:20,033
but I'll meet you guys at
the Bright Nights booth?

349
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,400
- Yep. Okay, come
on you. Good work.

350
00:14:22,533 --> 00:14:25,033
- How did you get Dad
to change his mind

351
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,266
about Bright Nights?

352
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,767
- How do you think? I
appealed to his ego.

353
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,300
He saw a bunch of people lining
up to see a house decorated

354
00:14:31,433 --> 00:14:33,266
by that new company, GlowScapes.

355
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,734
I think that really
lit a fire under him.

356
00:14:35,867 --> 00:14:36,900
- Nono can bring it.

357
00:14:37,033 --> 00:14:38,400
- Yes.

358
00:14:38,533 --> 00:14:39,967
- Let's hope that attention
to detail that makes him such

359
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,967
a great contractor doesn't
freeze him up this year.

360
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,367
- If we get into
Bright Night finals,

361
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,767
I'm telling you we can win it.

362
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,767
- If, ifs and buts
were candy and nuts,

363
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,033
what a merry
Christmas it would be.

364
00:14:57,066 --> 00:14:58,900
- Two pizzelles, please.

365
00:14:59,033 --> 00:15:01,233
- What he said. Thank you.

366
00:15:04,066 --> 00:15:07,433
And a half dozen
assorted, please.

367
00:15:07,567 --> 00:15:10,734
- That's a lot, Uncle
Tony. Not good for you.

368
00:15:10,867 --> 00:15:12,934
- Well, they're not for me.

369
00:15:13,066 --> 00:15:15,033
Thank you.

370
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,600
Excuse me.

371
00:15:19,734 --> 00:15:22,033
I know it's usually the Girl
Scouts giving the cookies,

372
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:23,567
but I wanted to thank
you for the other day.

373
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,900
- It wasn't anything really.

374
00:15:27,066 --> 00:15:28,867
- If you were your
dad and I was my dad,

375
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,633
you would have just kept
driving, so it's not nothing.

376
00:15:31,767 --> 00:15:35,300
- Well, fortunately, we're
not our fathers. (laughs)

377
00:15:35,433 --> 00:15:38,166
And who is this young
man? Is this your son?

378
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,767
- No, no, no, no. This
is my nephew, Dante.

379
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,200
- What are you
talking about, Dad?

380
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,800
- Oh.

381
00:15:43,934 --> 00:15:45,166
- Quit playing, Dante.

382
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,400
He's my sister Maria's kid.

383
00:15:47,533 --> 00:15:49,033
- Who's Maria, Dad?

384
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,934
- All right. Cut it out.

385
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:52,333
He thinks he's funny.

386
00:15:52,467 --> 00:15:53,600
- Well I'm entertained.

387
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,200
- You want these?

388
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,433
- Yes, Uncle Tony.

389
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:00,967
- Get.

390
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,500
I think I see Maria over there.

391
00:16:04,533 --> 00:16:05,900
Are you here with your parents?

392
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:08,533
- Yeah. And my nephew.

393
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,333
- So where do you call home?

394
00:16:10,467 --> 00:16:11,834
- Richmond, actually.

395
00:16:13,066 --> 00:16:19,300
- I just came back about
a year ago from Boston.

396
00:16:19,433 --> 00:16:22,433
- Grace will find out about
the stores eventually, dear.

397
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:25,100
- I just don't want to
worry her unnecessarily.

398
00:16:25,233 --> 00:16:27,333
I got us into this
mess, I can get us out.

399
00:16:27,467 --> 00:16:28,533
- Mm hm.

400
00:16:30,533 --> 00:16:33,367
- Hello.

401
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,433
- Your Wade...

402
00:16:35,567 --> 00:16:37,834
of GlowScapes by Wade?

403
00:16:37,967 --> 00:16:39,300
- Wade Edwards,
pleased to meet you.

404
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:42,734
- (laughs) I'm Wendy Ryerson
head of the committee.

405
00:16:42,867 --> 00:16:45,266
My husband and I can't
pass by one of your houses

406
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,700
without stopping.

407
00:16:46,834 --> 00:16:49,367
It's like 4th of
July in December.

408
00:16:50,734 --> 00:16:53,934
- I'm so glad it brings you joy.

409
00:16:54,066 --> 00:16:56,000
- We'll be reviewing
the applications and
the committee will

410
00:16:56,133 --> 00:16:58,834
reach out to the four
prelim qualifiers sometime

411
00:16:58,967 --> 00:17:00,767
in a day or so.

412
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,066
Be sure to keep your
ringer on. (laughs)

413
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,300
Hi!

414
00:17:07,433 --> 00:17:09,100
- Hey.
- Hi.

415
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:11,400
- Can't wait to see what
you Ryans have for us

416
00:17:11,533 --> 00:17:13,467
under your Santa caps this year.

417
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,200
It's going to be pretty
stiff competition

418
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:18,367
with GlowScapes in
the mix. (laughs)

419
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,166
- You're going to show
our work as always Wendy.

420
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,066
- I don't know if you've
heard, but this year,

421
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,700
in addition to the municipal
contract to decorate every

422
00:17:25,834 --> 00:17:29,100
public building at Ashland
Falls next holiday season,

423
00:17:29,233 --> 00:17:32,266
Cardinal Group Energy is
sponsoring a cash prize.

424
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,433
- How much?

425
00:17:33,567 --> 00:17:35,367
- $50,000!

426
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,967
- Whoa!
- You're kidding me?

427
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,367
- Not a bad stocking
stuffer. Right? (laughs)

428
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,367
Well, good luck!

429
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,300
- Well, thank you.

430
00:17:43,433 --> 00:17:46,700
- You're going to need all
the luck you can get, Bill,

431
00:17:46,834 --> 00:17:49,800
because those tired
designs you're used to,

432
00:17:49,934 --> 00:17:51,500
aren't going to
cut it this year.

433
00:17:51,633 --> 00:17:54,066
- Well I didn't see many of
your lawn signs out there

434
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,700
this season, Frank.

435
00:17:55,834 --> 00:17:58,300
Seems to me that
it's your designs

436
00:17:58,433 --> 00:18:00,700
that people are no longer
interested in these days.

437
00:18:00,834 --> 00:18:02,333
- Okay, Bill. That's enough.

438
00:18:02,467 --> 00:18:03,834
- Don't start, Frank.

439
00:18:03,967 --> 00:18:05,400
- There's nothing
to worry about.

440
00:18:05,533 --> 00:18:08,166
Probably won't even
finish his design,

441
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,900
if he's chosen to compete.

442
00:18:10,033 --> 00:18:12,333
- Excuse me, I don't
remember you winning anything

443
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:13,667
these last couple of years.

444
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,633
- Remind me when the
last time you won was.

445
00:18:15,767 --> 00:18:16,633
Can you remember?

446
00:18:16,767 --> 00:18:18,100
- [Wendy] Gentlemen, please!

447
00:18:18,233 --> 00:18:19,967
- Well, I don't need an award
to feel good about myself,

448
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,433
like some people I know.

449
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,767
- Oh, oh, you want to settle
this old fashioned way?

450
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,834
- Sure, I would like that.

451
00:18:24,967 --> 00:18:26,033
- Huh, you want that? Come on.

452
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,266
No. You heard what
he said to me.

453
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,367
- Dad?
- Pop?

454
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,133
(Frank and Bill bickering)

455
00:18:32,266 --> 00:18:33,133
- Come on! Cut it out!

456
00:18:33,266 --> 00:18:34,633
What's going on?
What's going on?

457
00:18:34,767 --> 00:18:37,600
- Oh, just your father and
Bill Ryan going at it again.

458
00:18:37,734 --> 00:18:39,133
- If you two don't knock it off,

459
00:18:39,266 --> 00:18:42,033
the committee will disqualify
both of you from the contest.

460
00:18:43,233 --> 00:18:45,166
- But this is
Christmas, gentlemen.

461
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,333
This is the season of forgiving.

462
00:18:47,467 --> 00:18:49,900
- Bill, come on, come on.

463
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,967
- What if Dante sees you?

464
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,000
Do you want him to see his
Nono making a fool of himself

465
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:01,000
in front of everyone
in the town?

466
00:19:14,533 --> 00:19:17,233
- No-no, who was that man
you were arguing with?

467
00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:18,233
- Nobody.

468
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:19,834
- Mm. They used to be friends.

469
00:19:19,967 --> 00:19:21,767
- Good friends,
once upon a time.

470
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,033
- Started a holiday decorating
company in college together.

471
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,367
- Yeah and kept it going
after they graduated.

472
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,467
They called it Making
Spirits Bright,

473
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,066
was a nice little business
for them during the holidays.

474
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,166
- We even used to spend
Christmases together.

475
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,934
- What happened then?

476
00:19:36,066 --> 00:19:37,166
- Well...

477
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,967
He kept pestering me
to decorate faster

478
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,900
so we could get more clients.

479
00:19:43,367 --> 00:19:47,233
And all I really cared about
was doing the quality of work.

480
00:19:47,367 --> 00:19:49,000
He cared about the money.

481
00:19:49,133 --> 00:19:51,700
So we got into an
argument and he kicked me

482
00:19:51,834 --> 00:19:52,800
out of the company.

483
00:19:52,934 --> 00:19:55,133
- Yes. I broke up the company.

484
00:19:55,266 --> 00:19:57,667
Because Frank told
me that I was greedy,

485
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,133
that I put quantity
over quality.

486
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,100
Just because I wanted to
make a few extra dollars

487
00:20:03,233 --> 00:20:04,567
doing something we both loved,

488
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,266
doesn't make my reasons for
doing it any less noble.

489
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,500
- They were a great partnership.

490
00:20:09,633 --> 00:20:11,700
- We brought out the
best of each other...

491
00:20:13,233 --> 00:20:14,467
for a time.

492
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,900
You know, he would
draw up the designs

493
00:20:16,033 --> 00:20:18,800
and I'd put a plan
together and execute them.

494
00:20:18,934 --> 00:20:21,200
But when he insulted
me, that was it.

495
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,633
That was the end of our business

496
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:24,800
and the end of our friendship.

497
00:20:24,934 --> 00:20:27,633
- And that's when grandpa
opened up the furniture store

498
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:30,333
and turned Making Spirits
Bright into Deck the Halls.

499
00:20:30,467 --> 00:20:32,467
- Can't you just
apologize and make up?

500
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,033
You two were so close.

501
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,767
- Apologize to him
after what he said?

502
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,400
He should be apologizing to me.

503
00:20:38,533 --> 00:20:40,667
- It's a shame what
happened between you two

504
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,200
is all I'm saying.

505
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,767
- No, the only shame here is
that Frank was never admit

506
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,300
he was wrong.
Now come on.

507
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,867
(Grace sighs)

508
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,834
- Dad, I am going to
take Dante to school.

509
00:20:54,967 --> 00:20:56,567
- Give him a kiss for me.
- I will.

510
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,700
- Have a good day.
- You too.

511
00:21:02,834 --> 00:21:04,266
- Hey Dad.

512
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,700
I'm not going to
be able to help out

513
00:21:05,834 --> 00:21:08,233
with Good Tidings tonight
'cause I got a shift at the bar.

514
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:09,667
- Well that's all right.

515
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,500
We don't have any
customers anyway.

516
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,533
Listen, I know it's
not your dream job,

517
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:19,600
but if you ever want to learn
the contracting business

518
00:21:19,734 --> 00:21:22,867
from your old man, my
door is always open.

519
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,000
- I will think about it.

520
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:29,367
Thanks Pop..

521
00:21:37,033 --> 00:21:39,033
- Remember making this?

522
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:40,367
- No way.

523
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:44,533
- You made it at
the Ryan's house.

524
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:47,867
Such good memories
of those times.

525
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,667
You saw Arlene Ryan's
grandson, right?

526
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,667
- Yeah.

527
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,734
- He's the same age as Dante.
- Really?

528
00:21:53,967 --> 00:21:56,533
- It's a shame they
don't know each other.

529
00:21:56,667 --> 00:21:59,800
Oh, remember who made this one?

530
00:21:59,934 --> 00:22:01,033
- Maria?

531
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:02,200
- Grace.

532
00:22:03,667 --> 00:22:05,133
That'll be nice to have one
from the others on our trees.

533
00:22:05,266 --> 00:22:08,233
They have an ornament that Maria
made, found it in this box.

534
00:22:08,367 --> 00:22:09,967
It's been mislabeled.

535
00:22:11,433 --> 00:22:14,100
I think I will sneak this
around the back of the tree,

536
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:16,033
so your father
doesn't make a stink.

537
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:17,900
- Good idea.

538
00:22:18,033 --> 00:22:19,300
- Que bella, huh?.

539
00:22:19,433 --> 00:22:20,400
- Yes. Nice.

540
00:22:20,533 --> 00:22:21,800
- I meant Grace.

541
00:22:21,934 --> 00:22:22,967
- Mom.

542
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,200
- Oh, she's turned
into a beautiful woman.

543
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,734
- Ma.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

544
00:22:27,867 --> 00:22:29,700
I'll stop.
- All right. I gotta go.

545
00:22:29,834 --> 00:22:31,800
I'll see you later.
I love you, okay?

546
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:33,200
Ciao, Mom.
- Ciao.

547
00:22:39,133 --> 00:22:40,867
- Your father works fast.

548
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,200
- I know. He's a machine.

549
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:43,333
Okay.

550
00:22:43,467 --> 00:22:45,500
Red or green?

551
00:22:45,633 --> 00:22:46,834
- They're both nice.

552
00:22:46,967 --> 00:22:48,800
- What color will be
good in the windows?

553
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:51,200
- Either. They're
just wreaths, honey.

554
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:52,967
There's no wrong choice.

555
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,066
- Been having trouble
parsing good taste from bad

556
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,867
these days.

557
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,133
- [Bill] You guys
gabbing or working?

558
00:23:00,266 --> 00:23:02,400
- Remind me how much
you're paying us again.

559
00:23:02,533 --> 00:23:04,266
- You want to be paid? Huh.

560
00:23:05,633 --> 00:23:06,934
The nerve.

561
00:23:07,066 --> 00:23:08,900
My love and affection
should be more than enough.

562
00:23:09,934 --> 00:23:13,767
("Deck the Halls" instrumental)

563
00:23:19,133 --> 00:23:20,300
- Good crowd tonight.

564
00:23:20,433 --> 00:23:21,767
- Yeah, nothing gets
people out to the bar

565
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,834
like extended time
with their families.

566
00:23:25,433 --> 00:23:27,333
Ya know, there might
even be some single women

567
00:23:27,467 --> 00:23:29,867
out here tonight that's
looking to meet a nice guy.

568
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,033
Keep your eyes peeled.

569
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:33,133
- Sure, sure.

570
00:23:33,266 --> 00:23:35,467
- Hey, what about Lisa?

571
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,133
I heard her say you
weren't unattractive.

572
00:23:38,266 --> 00:23:40,066
- Nothing says interested
like a double negative.

573
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,400
(laughing)

574
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,834
- This seat taken?

575
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:48,333
- Well, it's not, not taken.

576
00:23:49,367 --> 00:23:50,734
- So someone is sitting here?

577
00:23:50,867 --> 00:23:52,800
- No, it's all yours, Grace.

578
00:23:52,934 --> 00:23:54,533
- Oh, you two know each other?

579
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:57,767
- Yeah, childhood
friends and what now...

580
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,567
decades old family feud.

581
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,500
- Well, in that case,
drinks on the house.

582
00:24:03,633 --> 00:24:05,033
Keep the peace between you two.

583
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:06,900
- Manhattan up. Thanks.

584
00:24:07,934 --> 00:24:10,266
- So what brings you in tonight?

585
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,700
- Oh, I had to get
out of the house.

586
00:24:11,834 --> 00:24:14,133
I mean, it's pacing
a hole in the floor

587
00:24:14,266 --> 00:24:15,633
waiting to hear
about Bright Night.

588
00:24:15,767 --> 00:24:18,333
- Yeah, mine's probably wearing
out the carpet right now

589
00:24:18,467 --> 00:24:21,233
as we speak.

590
00:24:21,367 --> 00:24:22,734
- Thank you.

591
00:24:22,867 --> 00:24:23,834
Oh.

592
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,166
Mm.

593
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,166
Well that's not, not delicious.

594
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,333
- See, that's how you do it.

595
00:24:31,467 --> 00:24:34,033
- Whatever. You take your 10.
I'll let you two catch up.

596
00:24:34,166 --> 00:24:36,233
And you let me
know anything else.

597
00:24:40,367 --> 00:24:42,834
- Been working here long?

598
00:24:42,967 --> 00:24:44,667
- No, he just throws me
shifts every once in a while,

599
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,400
when it's really busy.

600
00:24:46,533 --> 00:24:49,033
Truth be told anything
more than a vodka soda

601
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:51,433
and I am way out of my depth.

602
00:24:51,567 --> 00:24:53,100
- (laughs) Well, I'm glad
he's making my drink then.

603
00:24:53,233 --> 00:24:54,433
- [Tony] Yeah.

604
00:24:54,567 --> 00:24:56,133
Seems like a good friend.

605
00:24:56,266 --> 00:24:58,533
- Yes. Yeah, he's a good guy.

606
00:24:58,667 --> 00:25:00,934
We played hockey together
at Bishop O'Connell.

607
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:04,633
- And you got a hockey
scholarship to that fancy school

608
00:25:04,767 --> 00:25:06,367
in Arlington, right?

609
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,166
Yeah, probably why we
never ran into each other.

610
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,433
- Are you keeping tabs on me?

611
00:25:11,567 --> 00:25:13,233
- One hears things.

612
00:25:13,367 --> 00:25:14,233
- Okay.

613
00:25:14,367 --> 00:25:15,934
Well you heard right.

614
00:25:16,066 --> 00:25:19,300
After Arlington, I played
hockey at Boston University,

615
00:25:20,767 --> 00:25:23,166
but I blew out my
knee sophomore year

616
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,367
and that was kind of the
end of my hockey career.

617
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,600
- That must've been hard.
- Yeah, it was.

618
00:25:28,734 --> 00:25:30,934
But it was also kind of
a blessing in disguise

619
00:25:31,066 --> 00:25:35,033
because it made me focus on
school, for like the first time.

620
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:36,233
I got my MBA.

621
00:25:36,367 --> 00:25:38,066
- And what brought
you back home?

622
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,033
- I was working for
this marketing company.

623
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:44,100
I took a big swing
on this campaign,

624
00:25:44,233 --> 00:25:47,633
missed completely,
landed flat on my face,

625
00:25:47,767 --> 00:25:49,667
got canned and then I
moved back here last year

626
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,934
with my tail between my legs.

627
00:25:52,066 --> 00:25:54,133
- Well, there's something
to be said about going

628
00:25:54,266 --> 00:25:55,333
with your instincts,

629
00:25:55,467 --> 00:25:57,233
you know, just putting
it all out there.

630
00:25:57,367 --> 00:25:58,367
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

631
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,367
- Don't.

632
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,166
(laughing)

633
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,633
So what about you? What
have you been up to?

634
00:26:04,767 --> 00:26:06,400
- My college roommate
and I started

635
00:26:06,533 --> 00:26:08,800
a home staging business.

636
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:11,600
"At Upstaged, we're the
last stage you will need

637
00:26:11,734 --> 00:26:15,400
before selling your
home." (laughs)

638
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:16,400
- Catchy.

639
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,066
- Did you like that?

640
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,567
It was actually Sarah,
my business partner,

641
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,767
who came up with it.

642
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,934
She's the show-woman,
charmed for days.

643
00:26:25,066 --> 00:26:26,367
- And what, what's your role?

644
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,166
Are you the creative
genius behind the curtain?

645
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,633
- Oh, boy.

646
00:26:30,767 --> 00:26:35,233
Truth be told, I'm feeling
about as confident these days

647
00:26:35,367 --> 00:26:38,367
as you making a slow-gin fizz.

648
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,700
- I don't even
know what that is.

649
00:26:39,834 --> 00:26:40,967
- You don't know what that is?

650
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,400
- No. Does it mean you
make it really slowly?

651
00:26:42,533 --> 00:26:45,033
- Hey you two, a table
just opened up in the back.

652
00:26:45,166 --> 00:26:46,667
It's a little quieter.

653
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,266
- Don't you need
me to work though?

654
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,600
- Well, I haven't had to
remake any drinks tonight,

655
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,900
so the two of you chatting
is actually saving me money.

656
00:26:53,033 --> 00:26:54,934
- Wow. (laughing)

657
00:26:55,066 --> 00:26:56,033
- Thanks.

658
00:27:02,734 --> 00:27:04,934
- You like that?

659
00:27:05,066 --> 00:27:07,533
That's my mom.

660
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,667
We officially made it
into Bright Nights.

661
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,000
- Congratulations.

662
00:27:11,133 --> 00:27:13,767
(phone buzzing)

663
00:27:16,367 --> 00:27:18,433
So did we.

664
00:27:18,567 --> 00:27:22,333
- Well, guess this feud isn't
going away anytime soon,

665
00:27:22,467 --> 00:27:23,533
is it?

666
00:27:23,667 --> 00:27:25,600
- I guess not.

667
00:27:25,734 --> 00:27:27,000
- Game on.

668
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,333
- Congratulations to
each of our four teams,

669
00:27:38,467 --> 00:27:41,500
Deck the Halls, Good
Tidings, GlowScapes,

670
00:27:41,633 --> 00:27:45,200
and our last year's
winner, Mistletoe Design.

671
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:47,133
Each of you will be
randomly assigned

672
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:49,266
one of these lovely
homes around us.

673
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,900
And you'll have three days
to transform your deck house

674
00:27:53,033 --> 00:27:56,367
as thoroughly as your
imagination allows.

675
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,467
And any house that is
not completed by 6:00 PM

676
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,600
on the 21st will be disqualified
from the competition.

677
00:28:03,734 --> 00:28:07,166
Though I've been assured that
won't be an issue this year.

678
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,967
Our three person committee
will judge each deck house

679
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,133
on creativity,
technical achievement,

680
00:28:13,266 --> 00:28:15,100
and most importantly,

681
00:28:15,233 --> 00:28:19,066
the ooh and the ah factor.

682
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,934
who will then select two
finalists to go head to head

683
00:28:22,066 --> 00:28:23,467
for the grand prize.

684
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,834
A contract from the town of
Ashland Falls worth $25,000

685
00:28:30,266 --> 00:28:33,834
to decorate every municipal
building next holiday season.

686
00:28:33,967 --> 00:28:36,834
And this year Cardinal
Group Energy is sponsoring

687
00:28:36,967 --> 00:28:40,000
an additional $50,000
prize to the winner!

688
00:28:41,066 --> 00:28:43,033
(crowd applauding)

689
00:28:46,834 --> 00:28:50,467
- Hi, just wanted to
come introduce myself.

690
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,633
Wade Edwards.

691
00:28:51,767 --> 00:28:52,767
- Bill Ryan.
- Hi.

692
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,367
- Nice to meet you.
This is my daughter, Grace.

693
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,433
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

694
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,600
- And my wife, Arlene.
- Oh, hi.

695
00:28:57,734 --> 00:28:59,834
- So I've seen
your work, it's...

696
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,266
colorful,

697
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,734
different.

698
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:04,800
- Yeah, I think that's
why people are responding

699
00:29:04,934 --> 00:29:06,033
the way they are.

700
00:29:06,166 --> 00:29:08,100
Hired two new crews to
keep up with demand.

701
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,533
I'm sure you knew what that
was like back when you were

702
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:12,900
at the top of your game.

703
00:29:13,033 --> 00:29:15,900
- I like to think I'm still
at the top of my game, Wade.

704
00:29:16,033 --> 00:29:19,266
- Right, yeah, been five
years since you last one?

705
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,233
- Six, but who's counting?

706
00:29:21,367 --> 00:29:24,533
- Well every year's a chance
turn it all around. Right?

707
00:29:24,667 --> 00:29:25,767
Anyway.

708
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,200
Good luck.

709
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:28,633
- To you too.

710
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,200
- Your deck house will be
that one right over there.

711
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:35,467
- Oh great.

712
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,467
- We can work with that.

713
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,567
- All right.
- Yeah, good.

714
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,533
- And yours will be next
to Deck the Halls, okay?

715
00:29:41,867 --> 00:29:44,467
- Okay.

716
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,667
- Right.

717
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,734
So we'll take a
bunch of photographs

718
00:29:46,867 --> 00:29:48,033
and then I'll go
back to the shop

719
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:49,333
and start plotting the design.

720
00:29:49,467 --> 00:29:50,600
- Right.

721
00:29:50,734 --> 00:29:51,834
- A lot riding on
things this year,

722
00:29:51,967 --> 00:29:53,266
so we can't waste
a single moment.

723
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,266
- Yeah.

724
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,700
- [Grace] What was that dad?

725
00:29:55,834 --> 00:29:57,033
- Oh, I was just telling
your mother that second place

726
00:29:57,166 --> 00:29:58,533
won't cut it this year.

727
00:29:58,667 --> 00:30:01,000
- Ah, right, because second
place is just the first loser.

728
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,367
Yeah.
- Exactly right.

729
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,600
Anyway. Come on.

730
00:30:03,734 --> 00:30:05,066
- You always give the
best pep talks, Dad.

731
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:05,934
(laughing)

732
00:30:06,066 --> 00:30:08,033
- Come on.
- Yep.

733
00:30:08,166 --> 00:30:11,133
(cheerful music)

734
00:30:18,467 --> 00:30:19,700
- What about this color scheme?

735
00:30:19,834 --> 00:30:21,400
You think that would work again?

736
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,133
Just Dad's really
in the zone, huh?

737
00:30:26,266 --> 00:30:27,900
- And he wants to make a
strong showing after being

738
00:30:28,033 --> 00:30:30,033
out of the competition
for so long.

739
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,533
- You want some hot chocolate?

740
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:36,400
- Yes, sure. Fuel for the fire.

741
00:30:36,533 --> 00:30:37,767
- Yes, please.

742
00:30:45,867 --> 00:30:47,400
- Do you want something?

743
00:30:47,533 --> 00:30:49,567
- Oh yes. I'll take a
hot chocolate please.

744
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,900
It's been an hour
since I had some,

745
00:30:51,033 --> 00:30:52,600
my body's going
through withdrawal.

746
00:30:52,734 --> 00:30:53,967
(laughing)

747
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,233
- Thank you.

748
00:30:55,367 --> 00:30:58,300
- And here, let me get
that for you. Thank you.

749
00:30:58,433 --> 00:31:00,600
And two more, please.
Keep the change.

750
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,133
- You don't have-

751
00:31:02,266 --> 00:31:03,467
- After the pizzelles and
the free drinks last night,

752
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,200
it's the least I can do.

753
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,333
- Ah, thank you.
I appreciate that.

754
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:10,266
I'm glad we ran into each other.

755
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,900
I wanted to tell you what a
nice time I had last night.

756
00:31:13,033 --> 00:31:14,433
- Me too.

757
00:31:14,567 --> 00:31:17,900
I can't remember the last time
I stayed out until last call.

758
00:31:18,033 --> 00:31:19,734
- Well, I definitely prefer
doing it on that side

759
00:31:19,867 --> 00:31:21,233
of the bar, that's for sure.

760
00:31:22,367 --> 00:31:24,000
- Are you sure Pat wasn't upset?

761
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:25,667
- Oh yeah, he's fine.

762
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,467
I think he's just happy to
see me having a good time.

763
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,734
- Is that so rare?

764
00:31:31,867 --> 00:31:35,333
- Not as frequent as
I'd like it to be,

765
00:31:35,467 --> 00:31:39,467
but bumping into you around
town definitely helps.

766
00:31:40,934 --> 00:31:42,867
Are you just out
enjoying the calm

767
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,233
before the Bright Night's storm.

768
00:31:44,367 --> 00:31:45,734
- Ah, yeah.

769
00:31:45,867 --> 00:31:47,266
My mom and I are taking
out my nephew just before

770
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,467
we start helping Dad.

771
00:31:50,066 --> 00:31:54,200
And your dad, is he working on
his sketches for the contest?

772
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:56,467
- Oh, yeah. He's deep in it.

773
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,200
You know, your father
better watch out,

774
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,767
substituting candy
canes for snowflakes

775
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,266
ain't going to cut it this year.

776
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,734
- Yeah. Well, I think he's
got a few tricks in his bag.

777
00:32:05,867 --> 00:32:07,900
- Sure.
But I mean, you have to admit,

778
00:32:08,033 --> 00:32:09,633
his designs are kind of looking
the same the last couple

779
00:32:09,767 --> 00:32:11,100
of years, so.

780
00:32:11,233 --> 00:32:12,934
- Oh, maybe your dad should
spend less time dreaming

781
00:32:13,066 --> 00:32:15,367
up his designs and more
time executing them.

782
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,967
- Yeah. Maybe.

783
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:25,734
Well, thank you for
the hot chocolate.

784
00:32:25,867 --> 00:32:27,767
I guess this makes
us square now.

785
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,600
- Yeah, I guess it does.

786
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,934
- I'll see you later.

787
00:32:36,066 --> 00:32:37,266
- Oh, thank you, honey.

788
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,400
- Thank you.

789
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,900
- Don't you think that's
a little ambitious?

790
00:32:47,033 --> 00:32:51,033
Maybe we should save
that for the finals,

791
00:32:51,166 --> 00:32:54,467
go with something a little
simpler for the prelims?

792
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,033
- Well, we have to
make it to the finals.

793
00:33:03,367 --> 00:33:05,033
- [Bill] Something's
missing, isn't there?

794
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:06,567
- The only thing
that's not in there

795
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:09,200
is a complete re-creation
of Santa's workshop.

796
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:11,967
Keep in mind, we don't want
the deck house to collapse.

797
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,834
- It's got to sing, Grace.

798
00:33:13,967 --> 00:33:15,700
I mean the committee has to
have its collective breath

799
00:33:15,834 --> 00:33:16,934
taken away.

800
00:33:17,066 --> 00:33:18,433
- Yes, I know. And
you will get there.

801
00:33:18,567 --> 00:33:20,700
I just think that
you're possibly
overstuffing the designs

802
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:22,433
in hopes that bigger
equals better.

803
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:25,367
- Yeah, but you've always
been able to spin my ideas

804
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,033
into gold, so come
on, spin away.

805
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:29,533
- I think once
you start editing,

806
00:33:29,667 --> 00:33:31,367
you'll find the story
you want to tell.

807
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,367
- Yeah, right,

808
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,600
- Bill.
- Hm?

809
00:33:33,734 --> 00:33:35,367
- It's Alonzo, said
it was important.

810
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,266
- (sighs) Okay.
I'll be right back.

811
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,333
- Yep.

812
00:33:41,467 --> 00:33:44,233
Is it me or does he seem
more stressed this year?

813
00:33:44,367 --> 00:33:45,834
- Oh.

814
00:33:45,967 --> 00:33:47,934
I think Frank Scotto
being in the contest again

815
00:33:48,066 --> 00:33:48,934
is making him anxious.

816
00:33:49,066 --> 00:33:50,033
- Right.

817
00:33:50,166 --> 00:33:52,166
- You did not hear that from me.
(phone ringing)

818
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,967
- Oh, it's Sarah.
I should take this.

819
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,667
Sorry.

820
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,900
Hey.

821
00:33:59,033 --> 00:34:00,266
- [Sarah] How goes
it go it, lady?

822
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,600
- Uh, fine.

823
00:34:02,867 --> 00:34:05,967
- Try to contain
your excitement.

824
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,934
- Yeah. I'm helping Dad
with the competition again.

825
00:34:09,066 --> 00:34:10,400
- Pulled you in again, huh?

826
00:34:10,533 --> 00:34:11,500
- Neck deep.

827
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,967
- The reason I called was,

828
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,166
the producers invited us to
their annual holiday party

829
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,767
at the Whisper in Carytown.

830
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,133
- Uh, sorry. Sorry, what day?

831
00:34:21,266 --> 00:34:22,300
- 21st.

832
00:34:22,433 --> 00:34:25,367
- Yeah, sure. I'll be there.

833
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,500
Do you think that they'll want
us to talk about our ideas

834
00:34:27,633 --> 00:34:28,567
for the show?

835
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,834
Should we prepare something?

836
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:31,266
- It's a party.

837
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,166
Can't imagine they'd
want to discuss business.

838
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,166
- Right?

839
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,233
- [Sarah] See you there.

840
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:38,533
All right?
- See you there.

841
00:34:38,667 --> 00:34:40,133
Everything okay, Dad?

842
00:34:40,266 --> 00:34:41,667
- Yeah, it's all good.

843
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,567
Let's just get back to it, okay?

844
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,700
- Yeah.

845
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,367
- Hey, Ma. When's that
lasagna going to be ready?

846
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,166
- Don't rush the artista.

847
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:03,734
(fans cheering on TV)

848
00:35:03,867 --> 00:35:06,900
- How do they get the puck
into the air like that?

849
00:35:07,033 --> 00:35:11,000
- They practice and then
they practice some more,

850
00:35:11,133 --> 00:35:12,667
but there are some
tricks you can learn.

851
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,367
Juggling is a good
place to start.

852
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,734
- Juggling? No way, Uncle T.

853
00:35:16,867 --> 00:35:19,667
- It's good for the
hand-eye coordination.

854
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,967
- Your uncle used to
practice every night.

855
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,633
He always pushed himself
to try to be the best.

856
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:28,967
Even when things
seemed impossible,

857
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,133
he always pushed through.

858
00:35:32,233 --> 00:35:35,967
There was no quit in him.

859
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:39,900
- I should get going. Pat needs
me down at the bar tonight.

860
00:35:40,033 --> 00:35:41,066
Juggle.

861
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:45,700
- I think I'm going to
learn how to juggle.

862
00:35:45,834 --> 00:35:46,800
- Me, too.

863
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,533
- [News Man] At Ashland
Falls as the 15th Annual

864
00:36:05,667 --> 00:36:06,667
Bright Nights competition.

865
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,800
- Hey.
- Hey.

866
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,300
- Where's your mother?

867
00:36:10,433 --> 00:36:12,133
- She took Evan sledding. She'll
meet us at the deck house.

868
00:36:12,266 --> 00:36:13,433
- Oh, okay.

869
00:36:13,567 --> 00:36:14,633
- GlowScapes.

870
00:36:14,767 --> 00:36:16,333
The holiday displays
that have been the talk

871
00:36:16,467 --> 00:36:20,100
of Ashland Falls this season
are the work of Wade Edwards.

872
00:36:20,233 --> 00:36:21,367
Tell us more Wade.

873
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,100
- Families have been
stringing up lights,

874
00:36:23,233 --> 00:36:25,200
putting a snowman on a lawn
and lining their walkways

875
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:28,266
with candy canes
since, well, forever.

876
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,300
With GlowScapes, I wanted to
show there was another way,

877
00:36:31,433 --> 00:36:33,967
a better way to decorate
your home for the holidays.

878
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:37,767
- An Alexandria native, Wade
first saw the LED technology

879
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:41,867
he adopted online and
knew it was the future.

880
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,266
- How does he swing
publicity like this?

881
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,467
- Maybe GlowScapes
is just that popular.

882
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,033
I mean, people are lining
up just to catch a glimpse.

883
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:51,433
- Wade Edwards and
GlowScapes aim to do

884
00:36:51,567 --> 00:36:53,266
to the holiday decorating space,

885
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,967
what streaming did
for the video store.

886
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:59,467
With the crowds flocking to
get a gander at his creations,

887
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,900
the future of GlowScapes
looks bright indeed.

888
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,066
- All right, well,
let's get to work.

889
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,200
We got a lot to do.

890
00:37:08,433 --> 00:37:09,767
- I still don't get how he
gets publicity like that.

891
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:14,467
- And remember you have three
days to complete your deck

892
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:18,467
house and to give
everyone equal time,

893
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,900
each team begins
work at 9:00 AM,

894
00:37:22,033 --> 00:37:25,633
but it's staple guns
down at exactly 6:00 PM.

895
00:37:25,767 --> 00:37:28,066
You may test your design
once it gets dark,

896
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,633
but no work can be
completed after six.

897
00:37:31,767 --> 00:37:35,233
And you may start
your sleighs...

898
00:37:35,367 --> 00:37:36,934
Now!

899
00:37:37,066 --> 00:37:38,400
- Okay.

900
00:37:38,533 --> 00:37:40,333
I think I've come up
with a simpler design,

901
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:42,867
something a little
bit more practical.

902
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,333
- I need two cross beams,
one light going this way,

903
00:37:45,467 --> 00:37:47,667
one light going this way
and it's doing a dance,

904
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,000
it's doing a dance.

905
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:50,200
- I've got it right here!

906
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:51,467
- Get the landscape
out of the way.

907
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,567
This bush has to go.
That Bush has to go.

908
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,133
These bushes have to go.

909
00:37:54,266 --> 00:37:56,667
- Don't forget to have fun.
- Yeah. No problem.

910
00:38:00,433 --> 00:38:03,433
- By the way. Who's Alonzo?

911
00:38:03,567 --> 00:38:04,967
- What?

912
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,066
- Whoever Dad was talking
to on the call yesterday,

913
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,934
it seemed serious, his
whole demeanor changed.

914
00:38:10,066 --> 00:38:13,200
- He's the manager at
our store in Midlothian.

915
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:14,433
- Is everything, okay?

916
00:38:14,567 --> 00:38:16,533
- Things are a little
slower than usual.

917
00:38:17,767 --> 00:38:19,266
- I overheard a customer
tell dad that he thought

918
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,567
the store was closing.

919
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:29,000
Mom, if there's something
up I want to try and help.

920
00:38:29,133 --> 00:38:31,100
- The expansion last year
hasn't gone as well as

921
00:38:31,233 --> 00:38:32,367
we would have hoped.

922
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,700
- Ah. Well, how not
well are we talking?

923
00:38:35,834 --> 00:38:38,800
- Your father's sales
projections were a little off.

924
00:38:38,934 --> 00:38:40,967
With the lease on
the new building

925
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,667
and inventory costs doubling,

926
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,600
the stores are operating
at a loss right now.

927
00:38:46,734 --> 00:38:47,900
You know your father,

928
00:38:48,033 --> 00:38:50,767
he's always pushing
for bigger, better.

929
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,266
And this time he may
have gone too big.

930
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,767
- Why didn't you
tell me any of this?

931
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,533
- He thought we
could work it out

932
00:38:57,934 --> 00:39:00,533
and you would have dropped
everything to help.

933
00:39:00,667 --> 00:39:03,533
- Yeah, but that decision should
have been up to me to make.

934
00:39:03,667 --> 00:39:04,967
- Well now you know.

935
00:39:06,433 --> 00:39:09,700
So if he seems more amped about
the competition this year,

936
00:39:09,834 --> 00:39:12,633
it's because that extra
50,000 would go a long way.

937
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:18,800
- Yeah.

938
00:39:18,934 --> 00:39:20,934
- Maria, why don't you start
with putting the lights

939
00:39:21,066 --> 00:39:22,567
on the Christmas trees?

940
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,667
Anthony and I, we will
start on the roof.

941
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,834
- Okay.
- Okay.

942
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,834
- Tony, stop eyeballing
the competition.

943
00:39:32,967 --> 00:39:34,533
No matter how attractive she is.

944
00:39:36,367 --> 00:39:43,133
- Whatever.
- Come on.

945
00:39:43,266 --> 00:39:47,233
("Oh, Christmas
Tree" instrumental)

946
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,400
- Three, two, one.

947
00:39:55,533 --> 00:39:57,400
Everybody's stop for the day!

948
00:39:57,533 --> 00:39:58,700
Hands up! Up, up!

949
00:39:58,834 --> 00:40:00,233
Okay? Over there?

950
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:08,066
("Silent Night" instrumental)

951
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,266
- You okay?

952
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,767
- Yeah.

953
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,033
I'm looking at these box
of ornaments that I found

954
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:19,433
behind the couch.

955
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,567
- The ones the Ryans made
that mom tried to hide?

956
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,700
- She thinks she's
sly, but I'm onto her.

957
00:40:28,066 --> 00:40:30,333
- You know, it's okay to admit
that you miss those times

958
00:40:30,467 --> 00:40:32,600
with them.

959
00:40:32,734 --> 00:40:37,000
- That well of nostalgia
dried up a long time ago.

960
00:40:37,133 --> 00:40:41,367
Bill Ryan made sure of that.

961
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,200
- Okay.

962
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:46,300
Have you seen Mom?

963
00:40:46,433 --> 00:40:48,567
- She went to meet a
friend for dessert.

964
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:52,233
- All right. Well, I'm going
to go see Pat down at the pub.

965
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:53,567
I'll see you later?

966
00:40:58,767 --> 00:41:01,800
(indistinct chattering)

967
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,767
Hey.

968
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,300
- Hey.

969
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:10,734
Your deck house is
really coming along.

970
00:41:10,867 --> 00:41:11,767
- Oh, thanks.

971
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,834
Yeah, yours too.

972
00:41:13,967 --> 00:41:17,066
Hey look, about what
I said at the market.

973
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,433
You know, I think a couple of
decades of listening to my dad

974
00:41:21,567 --> 00:41:23,567
complain about your father's
work, it kinda creeped in.

975
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,166
So,

976
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,867
I'm sorry.

977
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,967
I think your dad's really upped
his game lately, actually.

978
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,333
- Thanks.

979
00:41:32,467 --> 00:41:34,133
And I'm sorry too.

980
00:41:36,333 --> 00:41:37,767
Oh!

981
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:41,133
Oh, no! What's
happening? (laughs)

982
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:43,533
I guess we're in the
middle of a snowball fight.

983
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,633
(crowd yelling and laughing)

984
00:41:45,767 --> 00:41:47,166
- Watch out! Watch out!

985
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,233
Ah!

986
00:41:48,367 --> 00:41:49,233
(laughing)

987
00:41:49,367 --> 00:41:51,500
- Oh, goodness. Are you okay?

988
00:41:51,633 --> 00:41:55,166
- I don't think
anything's broken.

989
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,567
- Oh, you've got a little...

990
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,166
- Check it out.

991
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,367
- The grandkids together.

992
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,400
- Oh, yeah.

993
00:42:11,533 --> 00:42:13,066
- It would be so good for them.

994
00:42:21,967 --> 00:42:25,066
?

995
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,533
- Mm.
- Mm hm.

996
00:42:26,667 --> 00:42:29,533
- Just because your fathers
have held this ridiculous grudge

997
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:31,633
never meant we had to
stop being friends.

998
00:42:31,767 --> 00:42:34,467
- We still take a girls trip
to Virginia Beach every summer.

999
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,633
- [Arlene] Mm hm.

1000
00:42:35,767 --> 00:42:37,633
- And Dad and
Frank have no idea?

1001
00:42:37,767 --> 00:42:40,333
- They're just too
stubborn to acknowledge it.

1002
00:42:40,467 --> 00:42:43,166
They're both right about
each other in a lot of ways.

1003
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,166
- I think deep down they
know we're still close.

1004
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,033
- Yeah, I saw Dad looking
at those ornaments

1005
00:42:47,166 --> 00:42:48,734
you tried to hide
behind the tree.

1006
00:42:48,867 --> 00:42:49,767
He didn't seem to mind.

1007
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,867
- Oh, it's just pigheadedness.

1008
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,500
- It's like Bill and the store.

1009
00:42:53,633 --> 00:42:55,200
He put money before good sense.

1010
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:58,367
We never should've opened
the other location.

1011
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,533
Carla knows.

1012
00:42:59,667 --> 00:43:01,100
- Oh, wow.

1013
00:43:01,233 --> 00:43:04,100
I guess everyone's up to speed
on all the family secrets.

1014
00:43:04,233 --> 00:43:05,667
- Yeah, with one exception.

1015
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,066
What are you two
doing out altogether?

1016
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,166
- Aah.
- Are you a date?

1017
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,333
- What? No.
- No, no.

1018
00:43:13,467 --> 00:43:17,567
We, we just bumped into each
other and then we saw...

1019
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:18,633
Not a date.

1020
00:43:18,767 --> 00:43:19,734
- Yeah, no.

1021
00:43:19,867 --> 00:43:21,200
But we should get out of here.

1022
00:43:21,333 --> 00:43:23,233
- Yes. Let's leave you to it.

1023
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:24,467
- Let you finish your...

1024
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,367
- And don't worry, your
secret's safe with us.

1025
00:43:30,266 --> 00:43:33,934
- They came in together and
now they're leaving together.

1026
00:43:34,066 --> 00:43:35,367
- Seems like a date to me.

1027
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,633
- Oh yes it does.

1028
00:43:36,767 --> 00:43:38,767
(Carla and Arlene laughing)

1029
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,333
- I can't believe it.

1030
00:43:40,467 --> 00:43:42,667
They kept their friendship
a secret for all these years

1031
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,700
without anybody knowing it.

1032
00:43:44,834 --> 00:43:45,934
- Yeah.

1033
00:43:46,066 --> 00:43:47,100
- I didn't think my
mother had it in her.

1034
00:43:47,233 --> 00:43:48,367
- Yeah.

1035
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:52,834
- What, you're thinking about
your dad and the stores,

1036
00:43:52,967 --> 00:43:55,233
aren't you?

1037
00:43:55,367 --> 00:43:56,667
You know, maybe I can help.

1038
00:43:58,133 --> 00:43:59,834
Put that MBA to use.

1039
00:43:59,967 --> 00:44:02,233
Sometimes it's good to have
an outside pair of eyes

1040
00:44:02,367 --> 00:44:03,700
to take a look.

1041
00:44:03,834 --> 00:44:06,200
- That is a very,
very nice offer,

1042
00:44:06,333 --> 00:44:08,900
but my dad's head would
explode if he knew a Scotto

1043
00:44:09,033 --> 00:44:10,667
was looking at
the company books.

1044
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,300
- Well...

1045
00:44:14,433 --> 00:44:17,166
maybe we don't tell them.

1046
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,734
If our mothers can pull
off a little subterfuge,

1047
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:22,300
why can't you and I?

1048
00:44:23,934 --> 00:44:25,934
- Meet me at the
store in the morning?

1049
00:44:26,066 --> 00:44:28,400
- It's a da--

1050
00:44:28,533 --> 00:44:32,100
an appointment, an appointment.

1051
00:44:32,233 --> 00:44:33,166
- An appointment?

1052
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,166
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1053
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:38,166
("Deck the Halls" instrumental)

1054
00:44:41,767 --> 00:44:43,300
- Is this all of it?

1055
00:44:43,433 --> 00:44:45,033
- What, you want
there to be more?

1056
00:44:46,467 --> 00:44:48,734
I'll give it to my father,
he is well organized.

1057
00:44:48,867 --> 00:44:50,867
- Well, let's get through
as much of it as we can

1058
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,066
before we have to get
back to the contest.

1059
00:44:56,266 --> 00:44:59,100
(gentle piano music)

1060
00:44:59,233 --> 00:45:02,266
Come on, grab the
spreadsheet, dig in.

1061
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,233
- Right.

1062
00:45:04,367 --> 00:45:07,433
(gentle piano music)

1063
00:45:14,734 --> 00:45:17,734
(birds chirping)

1064
00:45:17,867 --> 00:45:20,133
- What's wrong?

1065
00:45:20,266 --> 00:45:22,967
- I think I figured out how to
make those icicles look like

1066
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:24,633
they're melting.

1067
00:45:24,767 --> 00:45:26,967
But...

1068
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,300
- But what?

1069
00:45:28,433 --> 00:45:29,633
- Means, we're going to
have to take them down

1070
00:45:29,767 --> 00:45:31,133
and redo them.

1071
00:45:31,266 --> 00:45:33,266
- No. Pop, we don't
have time for that.

1072
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,500
- No, we can do it.

1073
00:45:34,633 --> 00:45:36,000
It'll only takes
a couple of hours.

1074
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:39,233
This needs to be perfect.
It needs to be my best work.

1075
00:45:39,367 --> 00:45:42,567
It's what the people expect.
It's what I expect of myself.

1076
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:44,533
Nothing less.

1077
00:45:44,667 --> 00:45:47,633
(curious music)

1078
00:45:53,433 --> 00:45:55,233
- Don't be too hard
on yourself, Dad.

1079
00:45:55,367 --> 00:45:57,033
Still got one more
day to make it sing.

1080
00:45:57,166 --> 00:45:58,633
Plus we only have to be good
enough to get in the finals,

1081
00:45:58,767 --> 00:45:59,934
right?

1082
00:46:00,133 --> 00:46:01,266
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1083
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,934
- Well that doesn't
look like much.

1084
00:46:13,066 --> 00:46:15,700
- Oh! (laughing)

1085
00:46:15,834 --> 00:46:18,166
- Well, that's because they
haven't turned it on yet.

1086
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:22,367
- And that's it for
today, everyone!

1087
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:25,633
We'll be picking the two
finalists tomorrow evening.

1088
00:46:25,767 --> 00:46:28,367
So make your last day count.

1089
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,934
See y'all in the morning!

1090
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:32,600
- Woo!

1091
00:46:32,734 --> 00:46:35,767
Haha! Yeah, yeah, yeah, Yeah.

1092
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:36,800
Yes!

1093
00:46:36,934 --> 00:46:37,800
(techno music blaring)

1094
00:46:37,934 --> 00:46:39,867
Ha! Woo!

1095
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,100
- Okay.

1096
00:46:41,233 --> 00:46:42,567
- What'd I tell you
about the cross beams?

1097
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,266
You didn't want to have
them, but I was right again.

1098
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,200
Wade wins again!

1099
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:51,867
- Still think it
doesn't look like much?

1100
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,967
(gentle piano music)

1101
00:46:59,667 --> 00:47:00,600
- You're up early.

1102
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:02,133
- Yeah.

1103
00:47:02,266 --> 00:47:04,100
A friend just asked me to
go through their company's

1104
00:47:04,233 --> 00:47:07,233
financials to see if I
could diagnose any problems,

1105
00:47:07,367 --> 00:47:09,233
coming up with a few ideas.

1106
00:47:09,367 --> 00:47:10,967
It's been kind of fun actually.

1107
00:47:12,233 --> 00:47:14,500
You know, I feel like
I can genuinely help.

1108
00:47:14,633 --> 00:47:15,533
It feels good.

1109
00:47:15,667 --> 00:47:17,100
- Anthony, that's great.

1110
00:47:17,233 --> 00:47:18,500
- Yeah.

1111
00:47:18,633 --> 00:47:20,233
- Good to see that
glimmer in your eye again.

1112
00:47:20,367 --> 00:47:21,700
- Thank you.

1113
00:47:21,834 --> 00:47:23,700
- This last year, I've
seen how hard you've been
on yourself.

1114
00:47:25,166 --> 00:47:26,600
I was starting to worry
that maybe you were taking

1115
00:47:26,734 --> 00:47:28,100
after your old man.

1116
00:47:28,233 --> 00:47:30,400
- (laughs) What do
you mean by that?

1117
00:47:30,533 --> 00:47:33,200
- Nothing. Never mind.

1118
00:47:33,333 --> 00:47:34,433
- No. Hey Pop, come on.

1119
00:47:34,567 --> 00:47:36,133
You can't just come...

1120
00:47:36,266 --> 00:47:38,600
I mean, take a seat. Talk
to me. What do you mean?

1121
00:47:44,066 --> 00:47:47,166
- Those first Bright
Nights contests,

1122
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:49,400
Every time I won, first
thought I had was,

1123
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,967
"How am I going to
top myself again?"

1124
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,934
I got so in my head about it,

1125
00:47:54,066 --> 00:47:55,900
it's why I couldn't
finish that year.

1126
00:47:57,333 --> 00:48:01,834
I stopped competing completely
because I was embarrassed.

1127
00:48:01,967 --> 00:48:04,100
I thought this year was
going to be different,

1128
00:48:04,233 --> 00:48:07,066
but we are one day away and
I can't make heads or tails

1129
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,467
of what I want to do or
what I'm trying to do.

1130
00:48:10,934 --> 00:48:13,967
I'm worried we're not
going to finish again.

1131
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,233
- Pop.

1132
00:48:16,367 --> 00:48:20,100
Come on. We're going
to finish, okay?

1133
00:48:20,233 --> 00:48:25,000
I promise, whatever it
takes we're going to finish.

1134
00:48:25,133 --> 00:48:29,834
Okay?

1135
00:48:29,967 --> 00:48:32,934
(Bill singing)

1136
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:41,633
- Morning, Dad.

1137
00:48:41,767 --> 00:48:43,367
- Oh, hey kiddo.

1138
00:48:46,066 --> 00:48:47,867
Everything all right?

1139
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,066
- Yeah.

1140
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,433
Sarah and I are supposed
to go to this party.

1141
00:48:50,567 --> 00:48:52,066
It's something that
should be good for us,

1142
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,900
for our business, but...

1143
00:48:54,033 --> 00:48:55,500
- You'd rather not.

1144
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:59,233
- The last few weeks we
haven't felt like partners.

1145
00:48:59,367 --> 00:49:01,300
It's been the Sarah show.

1146
00:49:01,433 --> 00:49:04,233
I can't tell if it's
because she's right

1147
00:49:04,367 --> 00:49:05,967
and my design sense is way off,

1148
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,333
or if she just decided
that her opinion matters

1149
00:49:08,467 --> 00:49:10,934
more than mine.

1150
00:49:11,066 --> 00:49:14,633
- Well, now I understand
why you're so hesitant to

1151
00:49:14,767 --> 00:49:16,734
give up your creative input.

1152
00:49:16,867 --> 00:49:18,367
- I know how much this
contest means to you.

1153
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:19,867
I didn't want to
lead you astray.

1154
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,033
- (laughs) That's the last
thing I'd ever worry about,

1155
00:49:23,166 --> 00:49:24,433
Grace.

1156
00:49:24,567 --> 00:49:27,266
- I guess I'm just
nervous to talk with Sarah

1157
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,700
about all of this,

1158
00:49:28,834 --> 00:49:30,800
because I know there's a chance
that this could be the end

1159
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:33,900
of everything we built together,
even worse, our friendship.

1160
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,100
- All right.

1161
00:49:37,233 --> 00:49:40,934
It's your voice, your
creativity. (laughs)

1162
00:49:41,066 --> 00:49:43,300
That's what makes
you so special.

1163
00:49:43,433 --> 00:49:46,100
You can't let anyone tap
it down or drown it out.

1164
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:48,867
A real partner will value
all of your opinions,

1165
00:49:50,367 --> 00:49:52,734
even if sometimes
it may be wrong.

1166
00:49:52,867 --> 00:49:54,133
You know?

1167
00:49:54,266 --> 00:49:55,734
Speaking of which,

1168
00:49:55,867 --> 00:50:00,300
if you have any miracle
fixes for this deck house,

1169
00:50:00,433 --> 00:50:01,800
now's the time.

1170
00:50:01,934 --> 00:50:03,300
- It looks good, Dad.

1171
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:05,967
- Good's not going to cut
it where Wade is concerned.

1172
00:50:07,333 --> 00:50:09,166
- Don't lose hope.

1173
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,600
- I'm not.

1174
00:50:10,734 --> 00:50:13,033
I'm just looking at the
reality of the things.

1175
00:50:15,667 --> 00:50:20,166
Anyway, I should get ready,
it's going to be a long day.

1176
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:21,567
Chin up.

1177
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,266
- Thanks.

1178
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,367
(cheerful music)

1179
00:50:42,233 --> 00:50:46,200
("Deck the Halls" tune)

1180
00:50:50,266 --> 00:50:53,266
- All right, load it out.

1181
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:57,367
Easy does it.

1182
00:51:04,633 --> 00:51:07,734
- Everyone's acting like
we already lost.

1183
00:51:07,867 --> 00:51:09,400
- Well, yeah, but I mean...

1184
00:51:12,166 --> 00:51:17,400
Step into my office.

1185
00:51:17,533 --> 00:51:19,000
(Grace sighs)

1186
00:51:19,133 --> 00:51:22,166
Look, based on where both
of our houses are at,

1187
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:24,800
neither one of them is going
to take us into the finals.

1188
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:28,333
- Yeah, but we just need one
of us to get to the finals,

1189
00:51:28,467 --> 00:51:29,867
and then we've got a shot.

1190
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,400
- True.

1191
00:51:31,533 --> 00:51:34,100
- I have an idea of how
we could do this, but...

1192
00:51:34,233 --> 00:51:36,200
- What?

1193
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,367
Wow, that...

1194
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,400
That's beautiful. You drew that?

1195
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,633
But that's way more
than a day's work.

1196
00:51:46,767 --> 00:51:48,400
- Yeah, for three people it is,

1197
00:51:48,533 --> 00:51:51,033
but with seven, we
could pull it off.

1198
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:56,767
- Where you going to get
these extra four people?

1199
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:00,867
(mischievous tones)

1200
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:01,934
No.

1201
00:52:02,066 --> 00:52:03,467
My family?

1202
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,667
- Well, you just said that
neither one of our houses

1203
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,533
are good enough to
make it to the finals.

1204
00:52:06,667 --> 00:52:08,834
But if our families
work together,

1205
00:52:08,967 --> 00:52:11,333
maybe we could bring out
the best in each other.

1206
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:15,500
- Or if the last 20 years
have been any indication,

1207
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:17,266
maybe we'll bring out the worst.

1208
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,834
- Did you bump your head
on the ice or something?

1209
00:52:20,967 --> 00:52:23,567
I would rather hang
up the lights for good

1210
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:25,266
than work with Bill Ryan again.

1211
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,800
- You know what?

1212
00:52:26,934 --> 00:52:28,700
If partnering up with him
is a more painful thought

1213
00:52:28,834 --> 00:52:31,200
than letting Wade and
his carnival light show

1214
00:52:31,333 --> 00:52:34,433
walk away with the
title, then fine, don't.

1215
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:37,800
But if decorating means
as much as I know it does

1216
00:52:37,934 --> 00:52:41,233
to you, then temporarily
putting aside your pride,

1217
00:52:42,266 --> 00:52:45,700
it's a small price to pay.

1218
00:52:45,834 --> 00:52:49,333
Look, I said we'd do
whatever it takes to finish,

1219
00:52:49,467 --> 00:52:52,133
whatever it takes.

1220
00:52:52,266 --> 00:52:55,567
This is what it takes.

1221
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:57,767
- Well, what does Bill say?

1222
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,233
- Bill?

1223
00:52:59,367 --> 00:53:00,300
He's...

1224
00:53:00,433 --> 00:53:02,333
- Open to it.

1225
00:53:02,467 --> 00:53:03,533
- Really?

1226
00:53:03,667 --> 00:53:05,266
- Well he didn't say no.

1227
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,233
- Hm.

1228
00:53:07,367 --> 00:53:08,667
The kids are right.

1229
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,166
There's no way our two
houses are going to make it

1230
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:12,066
to the finals.

1231
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,300
- Okay.

1232
00:53:13,433 --> 00:53:15,900
So we work together,
temporarily,

1233
00:53:16,033 --> 00:53:17,734
just so we have a better chance.

1234
00:53:17,867 --> 00:53:18,734
- All right.

1235
00:53:18,867 --> 00:53:20,767
But if that happens and we win,

1236
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:23,767
we split the contract and
the money, 50/50, okay?

1237
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:30,734
- [Frank] Let's go to work.

1238
00:53:30,867 --> 00:53:32,200
- [Bill] Let's.

1239
00:53:32,333 --> 00:53:35,233
- You and the Scottos want
to partner up. Really?

1240
00:53:35,367 --> 00:53:36,700
- Yeah, exactly.

1241
00:53:36,834 --> 00:53:40,066
We want to join forces and work
on just this house together.

1242
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,000
- Well, there's nothing in the
competition agreement saying

1243
00:53:42,133 --> 00:53:44,300
that you can't decorate
one house together,

1244
00:53:44,433 --> 00:53:46,500
but I do want to run
it by the other teams.

1245
00:53:46,633 --> 00:53:47,900
- Oh, we asked.

1246
00:53:48,033 --> 00:53:49,066
Mistletoe Designs
already signed off on it.

1247
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,100
- What about Wade?

1248
00:53:50,233 --> 00:53:51,867
- They have my full support.

1249
00:53:53,266 --> 00:53:54,467
Can't wait to see
what rabbit hole

1250
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,567
their collective
imaginations take them down.

1251
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,800
- Since their team now
consists of seven people,

1252
00:53:58,934 --> 00:54:01,934
I think it only fair that
Mistletoe Designs and GlowScapes

1253
00:54:02,066 --> 00:54:03,133
add to theirs.

1254
00:54:03,266 --> 00:54:04,900
- Mm. I feel good about
our current number.

1255
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:07,500
More people would
feel unnecessary.

1256
00:54:07,633 --> 00:54:09,533
(Wendy and Wade laughing)

1257
00:54:09,667 --> 00:54:12,266
- I'll let Mistletoe Designs
know where things stand.

1258
00:54:14,867 --> 00:54:17,200
You have less than half a day.

1259
00:54:17,333 --> 00:54:20,767
If your house isn't
finished by 6:00 PM tonight,

1260
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:22,500
you're both disqualified.

1261
00:54:22,633 --> 00:54:24,600
- Yep. Understood.

1262
00:54:26,633 --> 00:54:27,500
- So?

1263
00:54:27,633 --> 00:54:28,533
- We got the sign-off.

1264
00:54:28,667 --> 00:54:30,600
- Okay. Let's see those designs.

1265
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:32,000
- She's really good, Frank.

1266
00:54:32,133 --> 00:54:35,467
My designs have been uninspired
for a long time, but...

1267
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,567
Well, she's got a good eye.

1268
00:54:39,033 --> 00:54:40,867
- These are all really great.

1269
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,633
- Okay. Well where
do you want us?

1270
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:47,233
- I want two people on the
roof, two on the ground.

1271
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:48,633
Knock this out real quick.

1272
00:54:48,767 --> 00:54:49,867
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

1273
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,433
- [Tony] I'll hit the roof.
- Come on.

1274
00:54:51,567 --> 00:54:54,533
(cheerful music)

1275
00:54:59,467 --> 00:55:03,500
- Where do you want this one?
- Right over there.

1276
00:55:06,767 --> 00:55:07,834
- I think we're pulling it off.

1277
00:55:07,967 --> 00:55:10,700
- I had no worries whatsoever.

1278
00:55:10,834 --> 00:55:13,233
Okay, fine. It was
a Christmas miracle.

1279
00:55:13,367 --> 00:55:15,734
- Hopefully it's enough
to get us in the finals.

1280
00:55:21,767 --> 00:55:24,000
- Let's give another
big round of applause

1281
00:55:24,133 --> 00:55:26,000
to our four teams!

1282
00:55:26,133 --> 00:55:28,233
They all did such incredible
work, didn't they?

1283
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:29,433
Woo!

1284
00:55:29,567 --> 00:55:30,934
(crowd applauding)

1285
00:55:31,066 --> 00:55:34,100
But we all know that only
two teams will be moving on

1286
00:55:34,233 --> 00:55:36,266
to compete in the finals.

1287
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,967
Our first Bright
Nights finalist is...

1288
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:41,000
GlowScapes!

1289
00:55:41,133 --> 00:55:42,266
- Yes!

1290
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,133
Come on! Yeah! Cross
beams! Cross beams!

1291
00:55:45,266 --> 00:55:47,300
And competing against GlowScapes

1292
00:55:47,433 --> 00:55:51,000
in our 15th annual Bright
Nights finals is...

1293
00:55:52,467 --> 00:55:55,500
the combined team of Good
Tidings and Deck the Halls!

1294
00:55:55,633 --> 00:55:59,333
(cheering and clapping)

1295
00:55:59,467 --> 00:56:03,600
Hope to see you all back for
the finals in two nights time.

1296
00:56:03,734 --> 00:56:05,967
Good night, everyone! Woo!

1297
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,000
(crowd clapping)
- All right.

1298
00:56:07,133 --> 00:56:08,233
Congratulations!

1299
00:56:08,367 --> 00:56:09,433
- We just have to
do it one more time.

1300
00:56:09,567 --> 00:56:10,633
We got this.

1301
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:12,166
- Another step
closer to $50,000.

1302
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:14,600
- See, he's always
talking about the money.

1303
00:56:14,734 --> 00:56:16,367
- Hey, hey, come on, Dad.

1304
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,900
- At least I'm not so
self-centered that I have to be

1305
00:56:19,033 --> 00:56:20,800
perfect at everything I do.

1306
00:56:20,934 --> 00:56:22,834
- Dad.
- No, no, no.

1307
00:56:22,967 --> 00:56:24,000
Rather confront the
fact that you can't stay

1308
00:56:24,133 --> 00:56:25,533
out of your own way.

1309
00:56:25,667 --> 00:56:28,667
He blew up our partnership,
our friendship.

1310
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,700
- The work has always
come first for me, Bill.

1311
00:56:30,834 --> 00:56:32,800
It always has and
it always will.

1312
00:56:32,934 --> 00:56:34,800
You never understood that.

1313
00:56:34,934 --> 00:56:38,233
- What I understood
all too well back then

1314
00:56:38,367 --> 00:56:41,500
was that your perfectionism
was never about the jobs,

1315
00:56:41,633 --> 00:56:44,233
it was all about
satisfying your own ego.

1316
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:45,667
decorating was never
about other people,

1317
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,500
it was always about you,
making yourself happy.

1318
00:56:48,633 --> 00:56:49,734
- Okay, come on. Let's cool it.

1319
00:56:49,867 --> 00:56:51,200
- Yeah. It's been a long day.

1320
00:56:51,333 --> 00:56:53,266
Let's just all go home
before you say something

1321
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,834
you can't take back, okay?

1322
00:56:56,767 --> 00:57:00,400
- A little late for that.

1323
00:57:00,533 --> 00:57:02,200
- [Grace] Dad, come on.

1324
00:57:13,567 --> 00:57:15,500
At least they didn't wrestle.

1325
00:57:15,633 --> 00:57:17,600
- Well, tomorrow's another day.

1326
00:57:17,734 --> 00:57:20,000
- Do we need to re-explain
the concept

1327
00:57:20,133 --> 00:57:22,000
of naughty nice to them?

1328
00:57:22,133 --> 00:57:23,433
- Couldn't hurt.

1329
00:57:23,567 --> 00:57:25,667
So do you have any
plans for this evening?

1330
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,233
- Yeah, I'm heading to Richmond.

1331
00:57:27,367 --> 00:57:30,433
My business partner and I got
invited to this holiday party

1332
00:57:30,567 --> 00:57:32,200
these producers are throwing.

1333
00:57:32,333 --> 00:57:34,667
- And what do these
producers produce?

1334
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:35,900
- Reality TV.

1335
00:57:37,367 --> 00:57:40,633
They approached us about
doing a home staging show

1336
00:57:40,767 --> 00:57:42,467
and Sarah and I
would be the hosts.

1337
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:49,266
- How am I just hearing
about this? That's amazing.

1338
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:52,367
Well, hopefully we can keep
them on their best behavior

1339
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:53,467
tomorrow.

1340
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,900
- (laughs) Yeah, good luck.

1341
00:57:56,467 --> 00:57:57,967
- Uh...

1342
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:59,133
Night
- Night, yep

1343
00:58:04,934 --> 00:58:06,934
(sighs)

1344
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:08,033
- What's wrong?

1345
00:58:08,166 --> 00:58:09,734
- My mom has my car keys.

1346
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:12,700
- Really?

1347
00:58:12,834 --> 00:58:13,934
- Yeah, she borrowed them to
get an extra pair of gloves

1348
00:58:14,066 --> 00:58:15,834
and I forgot to
get the keys back.

1349
00:58:15,967 --> 00:58:18,767
- Jeez. That's too bad.

1350
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:19,867
- Yeah.

1351
00:58:22,867 --> 00:58:25,233
- Well. Have a great night.

1352
00:58:25,367 --> 00:58:26,633
- Oh, Tony!

1353
00:58:26,767 --> 00:58:28,967
- What?

1354
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:31,633
I'm just kidding.

1355
00:58:31,767 --> 00:58:33,200
Come on, I'll give you a ride,

1356
00:58:33,333 --> 00:58:36,100
but this really
does make a square.

1357
00:58:36,233 --> 00:58:39,333
- Totally.

1358
00:58:39,467 --> 00:58:41,800
(Grace laughs)

1359
00:58:41,934 --> 00:58:45,900
("Deck the Halls" instrumental)

1360
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:49,033
- It's a good thing
you had that extra key.

1361
00:58:49,166 --> 00:58:51,133
- A Girl Scout always
has a backup plan.

1362
00:58:52,767 --> 00:58:55,300
- You sure you want me
to come to this party?

1363
00:58:55,433 --> 00:58:57,266
I'm not exactly dressed for it.

1364
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,467
- You drove all this way,

1365
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,867
let me at least buy
you a free drink

1366
00:59:00,066 --> 00:59:02,467
and fill you up on
canapes for the trouble.

1367
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:04,400
- You've got a nice place.

1368
00:59:04,533 --> 00:59:07,567
It's almost like you
stage homes for a living.

1369
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:08,834
- Like it?

1370
00:59:08,967 --> 00:59:10,200
- Yeah, it's...

1371
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:15,367
It's beautiful.

1372
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:18,033
(gentle piano music)

1373
00:59:18,166 --> 00:59:20,834
- I didn't bring any party
clothes to my parent's house,

1374
00:59:20,967 --> 00:59:22,266
so thanks for the pit stop.

1375
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,367
Shall we?

1376
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:26,633
- Let's do it.

1377
00:59:32,633 --> 00:59:35,433
- I just love Richmond
during the Christmas time.

1378
00:59:35,567 --> 00:59:36,767
- Yeah.

1379
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:37,900
It's pretty special.

1380
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:40,633
- Actually, the bar's
not too far from here.

1381
00:59:40,767 --> 00:59:42,266
Do you want to just walk?

1382
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,300
- I'd love to.

1383
00:59:44,433 --> 00:59:45,533
Ooh! Ooh!
- Aah!

1384
00:59:45,667 --> 00:59:46,567
(laughing)

1385
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:47,867
Are you okay?

1386
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,300
- Yeah.

1387
00:59:49,433 --> 00:59:50,767
- Wow, for a hockey player,

1388
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:52,767
you aren't so
graceful on the ice.

1389
00:59:57,066 --> 00:59:58,700
- There she is.

1390
00:59:58,834 --> 01:00:00,767
- Hi.

1391
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:02,000
- Don't worry about me.

1392
01:00:02,133 --> 01:00:04,133
You do your thing
and I'll go mingle.

1393
01:00:04,266 --> 01:00:06,066
- Okay.

1394
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:09,967
- Hey Henry, how are you guys?

1395
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:11,900
- Our lustrous producer was
just asking us what the show

1396
01:00:12,033 --> 01:00:13,433
might be like.

1397
01:00:13,567 --> 01:00:16,633
- Well, we haven't had time
to discuss the direction yet,

1398
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:18,066
but we're-

1399
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,367
- But the show should follow
us meeting our clients

1400
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:21,133
and seeing their houses
for the first time,

1401
01:00:21,266 --> 01:00:23,433
how we come up with the
design and the layouts,

1402
01:00:23,567 --> 01:00:25,233
and you can give them
all those little details

1403
01:00:25,367 --> 01:00:27,400
about the furniture
you love to talk about.

1404
01:00:27,533 --> 01:00:31,000
And we can end each episode
with the houses being sold

1405
01:00:31,133 --> 01:00:32,934
for over asking, of course.

1406
01:00:33,066 --> 01:00:33,967
(Henry laughs)

1407
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:35,667
- Yeah, exactly.

1408
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,767
- See, whole idea sells itself.

1409
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,533
- It's got a perfectly
built-in structure.

1410
01:00:39,667 --> 01:00:41,467
It's really smart.

1411
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:42,667
Can you excuse me for a minute?

1412
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,166
Don't go. I'll be right back.

1413
01:00:47,433 --> 01:00:50,233
- Did you hear that?
He loved our idea.

1414
01:00:50,367 --> 01:00:53,367
The dynamic duo strikes again.

1415
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:54,867
- Okay, about that,

1416
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,734
I feel like we haven't
been much of a duo lately.

1417
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,300
It feels more like
I'm your plus one.

1418
01:01:01,433 --> 01:01:03,166
- What? How do you mean?

1419
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:05,500
- Oh, you just been...

1420
01:01:06,967 --> 01:01:10,033
really dismissive of my
ideas the past few months,

1421
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:12,834
like my opinion doesn't seem
to matter to you anymore.

1422
01:01:12,967 --> 01:01:15,834
- Grace, your
opinion matters to me

1423
01:01:15,967 --> 01:01:17,834
when you stand behind it.

1424
01:01:17,967 --> 01:01:19,066
- What?

1425
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,767
- If you really
believed in an idea,

1426
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:23,033
then you need to push back.

1427
01:01:23,166 --> 01:01:24,333
But when you don't say anything,

1428
01:01:24,467 --> 01:01:26,834
I have to assume
we're in agreement.

1429
01:01:26,967 --> 01:01:28,233
I can't read your mind.

1430
01:01:28,367 --> 01:01:30,667
- Yeah, but you just
dismissed what I had to say

1431
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,100
in front of Henry a second ago.

1432
01:01:32,233 --> 01:01:34,333
I'm not even sure you
know you're doing it.

1433
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,100
- Maybe this isn't the best
place for us to be having

1434
01:01:38,233 --> 01:01:39,233
this conversation.

1435
01:01:40,266 --> 01:01:42,133
- Yeah, you're right.

1436
01:01:42,266 --> 01:01:43,734
I should go.

1437
01:01:50,567 --> 01:01:54,166
- Excuse me. Sorry.

1438
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:55,333
Hey.

1439
01:01:55,467 --> 01:01:56,767
- Can we go?

1440
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:59,233
- Yeah, of course.
- Okay, thanks.

1441
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:07,467
- Well, I think it's good
that you said something,

1442
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:10,100
got it off your mind before
your business relationship

1443
01:02:10,233 --> 01:02:11,467
poisoned your friendship.

1444
01:02:14,633 --> 01:02:15,500
There you go.

1445
01:02:15,633 --> 01:02:16,567
- Thank you so much. Yah!

1446
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,000
- I don't know how they do that.

1447
01:02:18,133 --> 01:02:20,033
You could not pay me
enough money to sing

1448
01:02:20,166 --> 01:02:21,567
in front of people.

1449
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:24,200
- Well, you played hockey in
front of thousands of people

1450
01:02:24,333 --> 01:02:26,400
but you think singing is scary.

1451
01:02:26,533 --> 01:02:29,166
- You obviously have
not heard me sing.

1452
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:30,633
- (laughing) You're
right. You're right.

1453
01:02:30,767 --> 01:02:31,734
But...

1454
01:02:31,867 --> 01:02:33,333
Come on. It can't be that bad.

1455
01:02:34,367 --> 01:02:35,400
- Ooh.

1456
01:02:35,533 --> 01:02:37,467
- When was the last
time you tried?

1457
01:02:38,734 --> 01:02:41,033
- Um.

1458
01:02:41,166 --> 01:02:44,400
Well, it wasn't the
last time, but...

1459
01:02:44,533 --> 01:02:47,133
this one Christmas,

1460
01:02:47,266 --> 01:02:49,734
my parents took Maria
and I to Tuscany.

1461
01:02:49,867 --> 01:02:52,533
Actually it was right after
the falling out with your dad.

1462
01:02:52,667 --> 01:02:55,734
And my cousins, they have
this tradition where they

1463
01:02:55,867 --> 01:02:57,700
go through the
neighborhood door to door,

1464
01:02:57,834 --> 01:03:01,900
just belting out Italian
Christmas carols, right?

1465
01:03:02,033 --> 01:03:04,800
And then the neighbors come
out and they give you candy

1466
01:03:04,934 --> 01:03:06,867
and sweets for your trouble.

1467
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,467
- That sounds like fun.

1468
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:10,500
- Yeah, it is.

1469
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:13,700
But I think there's
something about singing

1470
01:03:13,834 --> 01:03:15,233
in a foreign language,

1471
01:03:15,367 --> 01:03:17,066
just makes you feel
less self-conscious,

1472
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,066
because we barely
knew any Italian,

1473
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,567
and my cousins didn't
know any English,

1474
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:24,667
but somehow it just, it
brought us closer together.

1475
01:03:26,133 --> 01:03:29,000
I think mutual embarrassment
kind of tears down walls,

1476
01:03:29,133 --> 01:03:30,066
if that makes sense.

1477
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:32,166
- Right. Yes.

1478
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:34,900
- Ya know what? I have an idea.

1479
01:03:35,033 --> 01:03:36,367
Come on.

1480
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:37,600
- Okay.

1489
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:37,800

We have plenty of vino

1491

Let's get out of the cold.

1492

hoping that you would join us

01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:56,400
- You were right, Frank.

1508
01:05:56,533 --> 01:06:01,633
I put profit ahead of all the
work that we did together.

1509
01:06:01,767 --> 01:06:03,133
Instead of asking
you how you felt,

1510
01:06:03,266 --> 01:06:05,900
I pushed you into a place that
made you feel uncomfortable.

1511
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:13,000
- Well, despite all that,

1512
01:06:13,133 --> 01:06:14,633
I know that you just
wanted to get the most

1513

out of working together.

1514
01:06:17,433 --> 01:06:22,633
My stubbornness and my ego
kept me from seeing that.

1515
01:06:22,767 --> 01:06:24,700
- Yeah.

1516
01:06:24,834 --> 01:06:28,467
Remember joking about our
kids being together someday?

1517
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:31,567
- Well, if we weren't so
wrapped up in holding grudges,

1518
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:33,467
maybe it would have
happened sooner.

1519
01:06:40,066 --> 01:06:43,834
I'm sorry, Bill.

1520
01:06:43,967 --> 01:06:46,600
- Me too, Frank. Me too.

1521
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:06,000
Same rules apply as before.

1522
01:07:06,133 --> 01:07:09,700
All we're asking for is
your most ambitious displays

1523
01:07:09,834 --> 01:07:11,500
of your lives!

1524
01:07:11,633 --> 01:07:13,967

Now!

1526
01:07:17,133 --> 01:07:18,600
- Okay.

1527
01:07:18,734 --> 01:07:21,367
- Okay. So what's the plan?

1528
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:23,767
- Well, actually your story
about Italy got me thinking

1529
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:25,900
about other Italian
Christmas traditions.

1530
01:07:26,033 --> 01:07:29,066
So I did some research and
I found something I think

1531
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:32,333
to be pretty interesting
and completely unexpected.

1532
01:07:33,934 --> 01:07:35,333
- A ceppo.

1533
01:07:35,467 --> 01:07:38,300
My grandparents always had a
tree of light at Christmas.

1534
01:07:38,433 --> 01:07:40,367
- And it can also
mean yule log, right?

1535
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:41,867
- Yes.

1536
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,367
The tradition is that you
cut a trunk of the tree

1537
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:46,367
and you burn the log in the
fireplace on Christmas night.

1538
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:48,533
And then the kids of the family,

1539
01:07:48,667 --> 01:07:51,667
they hit the burning embers
till the sparks fly up

1540
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,200
into the air,

1541
01:07:53,333 --> 01:07:55,533
symbolizing the hopes of the
family for the coming year.

1542
01:07:57,166 --> 01:07:58,467
- Can we do it in two days?

1543
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,934
- Well, give it a
detailed design,

1544
01:08:01,066 --> 01:08:04,033
no one second guessing
each other, complete focus

1545
01:08:04,166 --> 01:08:07,300
and every available family
member lending a hand.

1546
01:08:08,834 --> 01:08:09,700
Maybe.

1547
01:08:09,834 --> 01:08:11,433
(Grace laughs)

1548
01:08:11,567 --> 01:08:12,533
- Okay.

1549
01:08:12,667 --> 01:08:14,700
- Where do you want me to start?

1550
01:08:14,834 --> 01:08:16,967
- The lights Tony and
Grace are laying in,

1551
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:19,633
are going to lead to the
second tier of the ceppo.

1552
01:08:19,767 --> 01:08:21,600
- Uh huh. It's
going to look great.

1553
01:08:21,734 --> 01:08:22,934
- I think so.
- Yep.

1554
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:27,367
Hey Grace.
- Hey.

1555
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:29,533
- I just want to thank you.

1556
01:08:29,667 --> 01:08:30,633
- For what?

1557
01:08:32,066 --> 01:08:33,934
- For helping me to
realize why I got

1558
01:08:34,066 --> 01:08:37,033
into the decorating
business in the first place.

1559
01:08:37,166 --> 01:08:38,967
Doing this with the
people you love,

1560
01:08:40,133 --> 01:08:43,633
trying to bring a little
joy into the world.

1561
01:08:43,767 --> 01:08:48,467
That should have always been
more than enough, you know?

1562
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:52,934
- Three, two, one,
everybody stop!

1563
01:08:53,066 --> 01:08:54,734
Tomorrow's the big day.

1564
01:08:54,867 --> 01:08:57,567
You'll have a few extra
hours to get every light,

1565
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,734
bow and bow in its place.

1566
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:03,767
- Let's see how this
looks, shall we?

01:09:22,166 --> 01:09:24,567
Boom.

1569
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:25,867
Yeah.

1570
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,333
- Whoa.

1571
01:09:27,467 --> 01:09:29,300
That was...

1572
01:09:29,433 --> 01:09:30,567
- Stunning.

1573
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:32,400
- Yeah, if their goal is
to give people headache

1574
01:09:32,533 --> 01:09:34,500
and blurred vision, then
mission accomplished,

1575
01:09:34,633 --> 01:09:36,000
otherwise I'm not impressed.

1576
01:09:38,967 --> 01:09:41,767
- All right. Come on.

1577
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:43,800
(Grace and Tony laugh)

1578
01:09:43,934 --> 01:09:45,800
- I think... I think we're
coming along.

1579
01:09:45,934 --> 01:09:48,200
- Yeah, we might even finish.

1580
01:09:48,333 --> 01:09:49,700
- We'd better.

1581
01:09:49,834 --> 01:09:51,834
I haven't been this exhausted
since two-a-days in college.

1582
01:09:51,967 --> 01:09:55,767
- Look, if you want to rest up
for tomorrow, I totally get.

1583
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,767
- No, it's better to go over
things with your dad sooner

1584
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:58,800
rather than later.

1585
01:09:58,934 --> 01:10:00,066
I'll see you at the house?

1586
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,433
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1587
01:10:02,967 --> 01:10:04,667
- I don't know what
Grace told you exactly,

1588
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,834
but any financial issues
we have with the store,

1589
01:10:06,967 --> 01:10:07,900
I can handle.

1590
01:10:08,033 --> 01:10:09,934
- I'm not so sure that's true.

1591
01:10:10,066 --> 01:10:11,500
After looking into your records,

1592
01:10:11,633 --> 01:10:13,934
it seems like you guys
are a little bit behind-

1593
01:10:14,066 --> 01:10:16,533
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. You
let him look at my records?

1594
01:10:16,667 --> 01:10:19,633
- Dad, just listen.

1595
01:10:19,767 --> 01:10:20,900
- Look.

1596
01:10:21,033 --> 01:10:23,300
The quickest way to ease
your monthly cash losses

1597
01:10:23,433 --> 01:10:25,133
would be to purchase
the building that houses

1598
01:10:25,266 --> 01:10:26,233
your Midlothian store.

1599
01:10:26,367 --> 01:10:29,734
- Ha! That's your big idea?

1600
01:10:29,867 --> 01:10:31,233
You want me to spend more money?

1601
01:10:31,367 --> 01:10:32,500
- Actually, yes.

1602
01:10:32,633 --> 01:10:34,800
I looked into it and the
lease holding companies

1603
01:10:34,934 --> 01:10:37,300
are already unloaded a few
of their buildings this year

1604
01:10:37,433 --> 01:10:38,700
below cost.

1605
01:10:38,834 --> 01:10:40,400
They might welcome the
opportunity to get another one

1606
01:10:40,533 --> 01:10:41,834
off the books.

1607
01:10:41,967 --> 01:10:44,500
You'd use your inventory, which
you already own obviously,

1608
01:10:44,633 --> 01:10:46,066
as collateral for the loan.

1609
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:47,633
Mr. Ryan, you do this,
you're going to save

1610
01:10:47,767 --> 01:10:49,800
about $2,000 a month.

1611
01:10:49,934 --> 01:10:51,867
- Which brings us
closer to even.

1612
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,066
- Exactly.

1613
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:54,633
And you're putting
your money into equity,

1614
01:10:54,767 --> 01:10:56,266
which gives you
some flexibility,

1615
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:58,400
if business doesn't
pick up right away.

1616
01:10:58,533 --> 01:11:00,233
Now your marketing,

1617
01:11:00,367 --> 01:11:03,700
which at the moment
is inventory focused.

1618
01:11:03,834 --> 01:11:06,000
It should really be about
letting customers know

1619
01:11:06,133 --> 01:11:07,834
what separates
you from the pack,

1620
01:11:07,967 --> 01:11:10,033
your expertise in refurbishing.

1621
01:11:10,166 --> 01:11:12,433
- Yeah, the part of the
business that you love, Dad.

1622
01:11:12,567 --> 01:11:14,800
- Your competition in the
area either doesn't offer

1623
01:11:14,934 --> 01:11:17,066
that service or they don't
have anywhere near the amount

1624
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:19,066
of years of expertise
that you do.

1625
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:22,100
It's low overhead.
It's high return.

1626
01:11:22,233 --> 01:11:23,767
You're a craftsman

1627
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:25,734
and your customers
need to know that.

1628
01:11:25,867 --> 01:11:26,834
- That's why people
came to your business

1629
01:11:26,967 --> 01:11:28,800
in the first place.

1630
01:11:28,934 --> 01:11:31,834
You're skilled to be able
to take a piece of furniture

1631
01:11:31,967 --> 01:11:34,100
and breathe new life into it.

1632
01:11:34,233 --> 01:11:35,567
- You see that? (laughs)

1633
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:38,667
-Ryan's Furniture, where what's
old can we made new again?

1634
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:39,734
I like that.

1635
01:11:39,867 --> 01:11:41,400
- Catchy.

1636
01:11:41,533 --> 01:11:43,633
- Now I know this
is a lot to chew on,

1637
01:11:43,767 --> 01:11:46,100
but I think these strategies
could really help put you

1638
01:11:46,233 --> 01:11:47,900
in a position of success.

1639
01:11:48,033 --> 01:11:50,700
- Well, if these numbers
are what they appear to be,

1640
01:11:50,834 --> 01:11:53,433
then what you're saying is...

1641
01:11:54,633 --> 01:11:55,967
Interesting.

1642
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:57,266
- I can send you the files.

1643
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:59,333
You can check the
numbers yourself.

1644
01:11:59,467 --> 01:12:01,066
Mr. Ryan...

1645
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:02,200
I just wanted to help.

1646
01:12:06,166 --> 01:12:09,133
(men laugh)

1647
01:12:17,133 --> 01:12:19,333
- This should be enough
I think, don't you?

1648
01:12:19,467 --> 01:12:22,934
(cheerful Christmas tune)

1649
01:12:25,066 --> 01:12:27,233
- Hey, Pop. Be careful, will ya?

1650
01:12:27,367 --> 01:12:28,567
- Yes, I will.

1651
01:12:30,433 --> 01:12:31,600
- How's it look?

1652
01:12:31,734 --> 01:12:32,800
- Great.

1653
01:12:32,934 --> 01:12:35,100
Hey, there's somebody
here to see you.

1654
01:12:35,233 --> 01:12:37,266
- Oh, yeah? Who?

1655
01:12:40,266 --> 01:12:42,000
Hey.

1656
01:12:42,133 --> 01:12:44,266
- The decorations look amazing.

1657
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,300
- Thanks.

1658
01:12:45,433 --> 01:12:46,900
We still have a long way to go.

1659
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:49,633
You didn't have to come
all the way out here,

1660
01:12:49,767 --> 01:12:51,433
you could have just called.

1661
01:12:51,567 --> 01:12:53,600
- Somehow a phone call
didn't seem right.

1662
01:12:55,033 --> 01:12:57,800
Remember how hideous our
Mount Kellogg dorm room was?

1663
01:12:57,934 --> 01:13:00,367
- Yeah, who could forget
those baby blue walls.

1664
01:13:01,667 --> 01:13:03,033
- But we made it work,

1665
01:13:03,166 --> 01:13:05,000
turned it into a spot they
would take applicants by

1666
01:13:05,133 --> 01:13:06,166
on the tour.

1667
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:08,400
Show them how comfy
dorm life was.

1668
01:13:08,533 --> 01:13:10,300
- Our first home staging.

1669
01:13:10,433 --> 01:13:13,300
- Where our friendship
and our partnership began.

1670
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:17,367
I'm really sorry, Grace.

1671
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:18,800
- Oh, Sarah, you don't-

1672
01:13:18,934 --> 01:13:20,066
- As soon as the possibility
of a show came around,

1673
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,567
I just...

1674
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:22,967
took over.

1675
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:24,900
I got so excited.

1676
01:13:25,033 --> 01:13:26,667
And the more excited I got,

1677
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,000
the more I wanted to
control everything.

1678
01:13:29,133 --> 01:13:30,533
It was not cool.

1679
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:33,600
And I completely understand
if you want to start

1680
01:13:33,734 --> 01:13:35,767
your own thing.

1681
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:38,033
- Whether or not the
show becomes a reality,

1682
01:13:38,166 --> 01:13:41,533
there is no one else I'd
rather be doing this with.

1683
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:44,400
I'd be 50% less
dynamic without you.

1684
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:49,834
- Friendship first,
business partner second.

1685
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:51,834
- You got it.

1686
01:13:51,967 --> 01:13:57,533
Aww.

1687
01:13:57,667 --> 01:14:00,300
- I'd stay and help,
but I got to get back.

1688
01:14:00,433 --> 01:14:02,333
Promised my folks I'd
meet them for dinner.

1689
01:14:02,467 --> 01:14:06,700
- I'll send them my
love. Happy holidays.

1690
01:14:06,834 --> 01:14:08,900
- Bye.
- Bye.

1691
01:14:09,033 --> 01:14:12,333
(sighs)

1692
01:14:12,467 --> 01:14:14,767
- I guess that went well.

1693
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:16,367
- It did actually.

1694
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:17,900
(Frank yells)

1695
01:14:18,033 --> 01:14:19,800
- Dad! Dad.

1696
01:14:19,934 --> 01:14:20,934
(Frank groans)

1697
01:14:21,066 --> 01:14:22,467
Don't move him. Don't move him.

1698
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,266
- Okay. Okay. Are you all right?

1699
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:25,533
(Frank groaning)

1700
01:14:25,667 --> 01:14:26,734
- [911 Operator] 911.
What's your emergency?

1701
01:14:26,867 --> 01:14:28,567
- Yeah, we need an
ambulance right away.

1702
01:14:32,266 --> 01:14:34,400
- Okay. Okay.

1703
01:14:34,533 --> 01:14:36,433
Yeah. I'll let them know. Okay.

1704
01:14:38,834 --> 01:14:41,166
That was Mom. Dad's
going to be fine.

1705
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:43,433
He fractured his clavicle
and had the wind knocked

1706
01:14:43,567 --> 01:14:45,166
out of him, but no broken ribs.

1707
01:14:46,533 --> 01:14:47,900
- The Bright Nights committee
said that the deadline

1708
01:14:48,033 --> 01:14:50,166
still stands.

1709
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:52,300
- We've lost a lot of time.

1710
01:14:52,433 --> 01:14:53,900
- Look, we all know what
we need to accomplish

1711
01:14:54,033 --> 01:14:56,333
and we can only get it
done if we work in harmony

1712
01:14:56,467 --> 01:14:58,567
as one unit,

1713
01:14:58,700 --> 01:14:59,900
as family.

1714
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:02,467
- Yep.

1715
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:06,500
- We have to finish
this for Frank.

1716
01:15:06,633 --> 01:15:10,500
- Two minutes everyone,
two minutes to show time!

1717
01:15:10,633 --> 01:15:11,934
- Are we good?

1718
01:15:12,066 --> 01:15:13,200
- I think so. I think so.

1719
01:15:13,333 --> 01:15:14,767
- Maybe we should just
check the connections,

1720
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:15,767
just to be sure.

1721
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:16,934
- Good idea.
- One last time, right?

1722
01:15:17,066 --> 01:15:19,033
- Yeah.
- Why not?

1723
01:15:20,567 --> 01:15:21,867
What's going on?

1724
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,133
- Come on. It's not
working. It's not working!

1725
01:15:23,266 --> 01:15:25,133
- We tested everything.
It should be fine.

1726
01:15:25,266 --> 01:15:27,567
- 30 seconds to show time!

1727
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:29,333
- I'll check. I'll check.

1728
01:15:29,467 --> 01:15:32,934
(suspenseful music)

1729
01:15:33,066 --> 01:15:34,800
(beep)

1730
01:15:34,934 --> 01:15:36,133
- Come on.

1731
01:15:36,266 --> 01:15:39,233
Oh my gosh. This
can't be happening.

1732
01:15:41,734 --> 01:15:43,667
- Okay. Okay. Try it.
It should be good.

1733
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:45,033
All right.

1734
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:46,133
- [Bill] I'll test it one
more time while we have time.

1735
01:15:46,266 --> 01:15:48,600
- Yeah, test it.
- That's it everybody!

1736
01:15:48,734 --> 01:15:51,967
No more tinkering,
testing, or touch ups .

1737
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:53,467
- Oh great.

1738
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,166
I guess we won't know if it
works until it's our turn.

1739
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:58,967
- Welcome everyone to
our Bright Nights finals!

1740
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:02,100
(crowd clapping and cheering)

1741

1752
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:15,767

it always should have been.

- You know, I just
realized something. -

1777
01:20:23,567 --> 01:20:24,633
- Oh, what's that?

1778
01:20:24,767 --> 01:20:26,700
- Well, remember when
I gave you a ride

1779
01:20:26,834 --> 01:20:28,800
and I said we were square?

1780
01:20:28,934 --> 01:20:30,033
We weren't.

1781
01:20:30,166 --> 01:20:31,433
- Oh?

1782
01:20:31,567 --> 01:20:34,367
No, 'cause I took that
snowball in the back for you.

1783
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:36,467
- That's right.

1784
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:45,033
(cheerful music)

1785
01:20:45,166 --> 01:20:47,800
- What about now? Are we square?

1786
01:20:47,934 --> 01:20:49,900
- Um.

1787
01:20:53,533 --> 01:20:54,800
- We're getting there.

1788
01:20:54,934 --> 01:20:57,433
(Grace laughs)

1789
01:21:00,133 --> 01:21:01,667
- Frank, will you get a move on?

1790
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:03,567
You move like a snail.

1791
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:05,800
- Bill, you don't want me to
fall off the ladder again,

1792
01:21:05,934 --> 01:21:07,266
do you?

1793
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:08,500
- No, I just don't want us
to miss the show, that's all.

1794
01:21:08,633 --> 01:21:10,233
- [Frank] We won't.

1795
01:21:10,367 --> 01:21:13,400
- I'll get the car.

1796
01:21:13,533 --> 01:21:15,900
- Hey, we should
have our own show.

1797
01:21:16,033 --> 01:21:17,433
- Hey Pat.

1798
01:21:17,567 --> 01:21:19,934
Yeah, look man, I just wanted
to thank you for hooking me up

1799
01:21:20,066 --> 01:21:22,567
with that restaurant
group in Bonaire.

1800
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:23,967
No, I think I'm going to be
able to turn things around

1801
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:26,166
for them.

1802
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:30,033
Hey, can I call you back?
My sister's calling.

1803
01:21:30,166 --> 01:21:31,033
Hey Maria.

1804
01:21:31,166 --> 01:21:33,500
Yeah, I'm gonna be home in 10.

1805
01:21:33,633 --> 01:21:34,734
Tell Grace not to worry,

1806
01:21:34,867 --> 01:21:36,367
I'm going to be there
before the show starts.

1807
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:38,467
Okay, bye.

1808
01:21:42,867 --> 01:21:44,600
- Cheese, cheese. I got
cheese just for you.

1809
01:21:44,734 --> 01:21:46,400
- [Arlene] Oh, yum.

1810
01:21:46,533 --> 01:21:47,800
- Have we started yet?

1811
01:21:47,934 --> 01:21:49,533
- [Arlene] No, no. Everybody
find a seat though.

1812
01:21:49,667 --> 01:21:51,166
- Hey, where's Tony?

1813
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:53,834
- Here I am!
- Oh, here he is.

1814
01:21:53,967 --> 01:21:55,734
- Oh, you inherited your
father's flair for the dramatic.

1815
01:21:55,867 --> 01:21:56,900
I thought you might
miss the start.

1816
01:21:57,033 --> 01:21:58,133
- Not for the world.

1817
01:21:58,266 --> 01:21:59,767
- Aww.

1818
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:01,734
I made your favorite.

1819
01:22:01,867 --> 01:22:02,734
- Oh, thank you.

1820
01:22:02,867 --> 01:22:05,467
- Okay, okay. Sit, sit, sit.

1821
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:07,467
You guys ready?
- Yeah!

1822
01:22:09,967 --> 01:22:12,033
- Okay, here we go.

1823
01:22:12,166 --> 01:22:13,033

1824
01:22:13,166 --> 01:22:14,500
