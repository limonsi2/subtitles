3
00:01:23,221 --> 00:01:25,119
- We have the 485.

4
00:01:25,154 --> 00:01:26,638
Wait down here.

5
00:01:26,672 --> 00:01:29,089
Wait till you guys pass
and we'll shoot up.

6
00:01:29,123 --> 00:01:31,332
We'll
make that happen right now.

7
00:01:32,506 --> 00:01:34,818
That's fine and we'll
have your equipment

8
00:01:34,853 --> 00:01:36,441
deployed up in the area.

9
00:01:38,684 --> 00:01:40,100
- You see
smoke, smoke, smoke.

10
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:42,136
You see big trees is all black.

11
00:01:42,171 --> 00:01:43,689
They on fire.

12
00:01:44,966 --> 00:01:47,072
- It
burns. Burns your nose.

13
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,729
Ooh, the smell.

14
00:01:50,972 --> 00:01:53,009
- Heat,
is like overwhelming.

15
00:01:53,043 --> 00:01:53,837
And like it's so intense.

16
00:01:53,872 --> 00:01:55,184
Like my face is burning.

17
00:01:55,218 --> 00:01:56,668
I couldn't breathe.

18
00:01:56,702 --> 00:01:57,738
I want to go home.

19
00:01:58,394 --> 00:01:59,395
I want to go home.

20
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:00,637
Like what did I get myself into?

21
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,711
I never thought
I was going to be

22
00:02:05,746 --> 00:02:07,092
a firefighter at all.

23
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,923
- How many
people can say, you know

24
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:13,202
my house was saved by
somebody that's incarcerated.

25
00:02:15,065 --> 00:02:17,206
- Brave?
I mean I'm just human.

26
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,621
Nothing to be brave about.

27
00:02:18,655 --> 00:02:19,967
As long as you just do it.

28
00:02:22,832 --> 00:02:24,040
It makes you feel good.

29
00:02:24,074 --> 00:02:26,042
Make you feel like,

30
00:02:26,076 --> 00:02:26,870
it makes me feel like

31
00:02:26,905 --> 00:02:27,768
my life has a purpose.

32
00:02:27,802 --> 00:02:29,149
You know what I mean?

33
00:02:29,183 --> 00:02:31,151
Even if it is just
helping a few people.

34
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,809
It's the freedom part.

35
00:02:34,844 --> 00:02:35,776
Oh yeah. It feels good.

36
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,571
You're not locked up but

37
00:02:39,089 --> 00:02:40,401
it also makes you feel good

38
00:02:40,436 --> 00:02:42,541
that you're not just
sitting there rotting away.

39
00:03:19,544 --> 00:03:20,821
- Well, my
first couple of weeks

40
00:03:20,855 --> 00:03:22,236
in the cell were like, oh

41
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:24,100
am I going to get out?

42
00:03:24,134 --> 00:03:25,135
If I can get out.

43
00:03:28,277 --> 00:03:30,244
After that I started
realizing, oh like

44
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:31,314
I'm here for what I did.

45
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:32,729
I'm not going to get
out any time soon.

46
00:03:32,764 --> 00:03:34,179
So might as well
just get used to it.

47
00:03:36,077 --> 00:03:39,115
Being in, being inside,
locked up in that room.

48
00:03:39,149 --> 00:03:42,152
Not able to go see my
mom whenever I wanted to.

49
00:03:43,913 --> 00:03:44,845
Just freedom.

50
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:12,079
- After adapting
for so many months

51
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:14,288
like, I'm used to it

52
00:04:14,323 --> 00:04:16,325
but it's not something
I want to be used to.

53
00:04:19,328 --> 00:04:21,019
I don't want to be in this
environment all my life.

54
00:04:22,123 --> 00:04:23,746
- All right.
Good morning guys.

55
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,161
Morning. Good morning.

56
00:04:25,195 --> 00:04:26,473
- I'm YCC.

57
00:04:26,507 --> 00:04:29,027
I'm a counselor at Pine
Grove, Ms. Paminsan.

58
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:30,718
They call me Ms. Pam for short.

59
00:04:30,753 --> 00:04:32,168
Ms. P.

60
00:04:32,202 --> 00:04:34,481
You guys are in the
intake process obviously.

61
00:04:34,515 --> 00:04:36,759
You guys have submitted
a camp application.

62
00:04:38,243 --> 00:04:40,901
What we're doing here is kind
of just prepping you for camp

63
00:04:40,935 --> 00:04:43,904
because the transition from
this type of environment

64
00:04:43,938 --> 00:04:46,216
into camp is very different.

65
00:04:46,251 --> 00:04:47,494
In this pre-camp program

66
00:04:47,528 --> 00:04:49,910
my job is to get you
guys physically fit

67
00:04:49,944 --> 00:04:53,223
and prepared for a wild
land firefighting, okay.

68
00:04:53,258 --> 00:04:54,397
Real quick.

69
00:04:54,432 --> 00:04:56,261
I like to get a
little introduction

70
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,745
of each and every one of you.

71
00:04:59,437 --> 00:05:01,197
- Um, my name's Keon Sims.

72
00:05:01,231 --> 00:05:03,717
I'm 19.

73
00:05:03,751 --> 00:05:05,443
My committed offense
is attempted murder.

74
00:05:05,477 --> 00:05:07,617
And I want to go to
fire camp because

75
00:05:07,652 --> 00:05:09,170
you feel me, I feel
like it could help me

76
00:05:09,205 --> 00:05:11,138
stay out of the
gang environment.

77
00:05:11,172 --> 00:05:13,692
That's polluted throughout
the YA facilities.

78
00:05:13,727 --> 00:05:14,624
You feel me?

79
00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:15,625
So I can get home faster.

80
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,695
- Yeah. Sure.

81
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,041
Good job.

82
00:05:18,076 --> 00:05:19,077
- My name's Joshua Dixon.

83
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:19,871
I'm 18.

84
00:05:19,905 --> 00:05:21,079
I'm here for a shooting.

85
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:22,080
They gave me nine years

86
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:24,047
but I have an early parole two.

87
00:05:24,082 --> 00:05:25,911
I want to go to fire
camp because I feel

88
00:05:25,946 --> 00:05:27,775
like being a fireman
is an honorable job

89
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:31,158
and it's a good experience
to help other people out.

90
00:05:31,192 --> 00:05:33,333
- My name's Alexander Bailon.

91
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:34,989
I'm 18 years old.

92
00:05:35,024 --> 00:05:36,543
I'm here for multiple counts

93
00:05:36,577 --> 00:05:39,753
of carjacking and
attempted murder.

94
00:05:39,787 --> 00:05:42,342
So going to fire camp
is a major step for me

95
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:44,309
and I really hope I get it.

96
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,138
So I'm gonna try
my best to do it.

97
00:05:46,173 --> 00:05:47,657
- Okay. Very good.

98
00:05:47,692 --> 00:05:49,901
It's nice to meet
all of you guys.

99
00:05:49,935 --> 00:05:52,904
One of the last counties
I was on a strike team

100
00:05:52,938 --> 00:05:54,388
was Mendocino County.

101
00:05:54,423 --> 00:05:58,081
Mendocino, that was the
largest in California history.

102
00:05:58,116 --> 00:06:01,257
And then the Paradise one
was the most deadliest

103
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,431
in California history.

104
00:06:05,226 --> 00:06:06,849
Any questions before
I make you guys sweat?

105
00:06:10,128 --> 00:06:11,025
Go!

106
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:15,305
- How you doing that?

107
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:23,831
- No pain, no gain.

108
00:06:23,866 --> 00:06:24,694
Let's go.

109
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:29,527
A hundred percent.

110
00:06:29,561 --> 00:06:30,390
A hundred percent.

111
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:32,322
- Woo.

112
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,601
- Anybody tired yet?

113
00:06:34,635 --> 00:06:35,774
- Yep.
- Hell yes.

114
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:38,052
- Already? We're
just getting started.

115
00:06:38,087 --> 00:06:38,984
- Oh no.

116
00:06:44,473 --> 00:06:46,820
- Who
hasn't ran in awhile.

117
00:06:46,854 --> 00:06:47,959
Oh, okay.

118
00:06:47,993 --> 00:06:49,236
Okay.

119
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,996
Something we need
to work on right.

120
00:06:52,032 --> 00:06:53,896
Gotta get that breathing.

121
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,311
You guys will be
carrying equipment.

122
00:06:55,345 --> 00:06:57,037
Lots of equipment.

123
00:06:57,071 --> 00:06:59,280
Going up 90 degree hills.

124
00:07:00,489 --> 00:07:02,698
You guys going to
be hurting tomorrow.

125
00:07:03,664 --> 00:07:04,562
It's good though.

126
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,013
- Being
locked up helped me.

127
00:07:08,048 --> 00:07:09,083
- Mhmm.

128
00:07:09,118 --> 00:07:10,464
- If I didn't get
caught up back there

129
00:07:10,499 --> 00:07:11,465
I would have been
caught up right now.

130
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,570
And look where I
would have been.

131
00:07:12,604 --> 00:07:13,329
In the main jail.

132
00:07:13,363 --> 00:07:14,226
- Mhmm.

133
00:07:14,261 --> 00:07:16,228
What are your short term goals

134
00:07:16,263 --> 00:07:17,575
while being here at DJJ?

135
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:21,164
- I would say like
better improving myself

136
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,994
educationally and mentally.

137
00:07:23,028 --> 00:07:24,202
- Mhmm.

138
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:25,479
- And especially
going to fire camp

139
00:07:25,514 --> 00:07:27,861
is my priority because-
- Okay.

140
00:07:28,793 --> 00:07:30,173
I heard it ever since
I've been locked up.

141
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:31,105
They're like, oh yeah.

142
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,004
Fire camp this. Fire camp that.

143
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:34,833
I was like, they're all
like, oh, but it's hard.

144
00:07:34,868 --> 00:07:38,043
I was like, I'm up
for the challenge.

145
00:07:38,078 --> 00:07:39,838
I like proving people wrong.

146
00:07:39,873 --> 00:07:40,770
It's what I like doing.

147
00:07:40,805 --> 00:07:41,702
I like proving people wrong.

148
00:07:41,737 --> 00:07:43,670
- Shit come on greens. Get down.

149
00:07:43,704 --> 00:07:45,119
Down.

150
00:07:45,154 --> 00:07:46,673
Up.

151
00:07:46,707 --> 00:07:47,881
30.

152
00:07:47,915 --> 00:07:49,261
All right get up
and shake it out.

153
00:07:51,816 --> 00:07:53,162
Shake it out.

154
00:07:53,196 --> 00:07:54,508
Do what you gotta do.
Drink your water. Stretch.

155
00:07:54,543 --> 00:07:56,027
- Oh. Oh.

156
00:07:56,061 --> 00:07:57,615
- You all right man?
- Oh damn.

157
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,791
- That throw up situation.

158
00:08:01,826 --> 00:08:03,413
Ooh. You okay?

159
00:08:05,243 --> 00:08:06,278
Good job guys.

160
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,387
- Is it going to be
way worse with that?
- Okay.

161
00:08:11,421 --> 00:08:12,284
- At fire camp.

162
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,769
- Some of them, yes.

163
00:08:13,803 --> 00:08:15,218
Yeah.

164
00:08:15,253 --> 00:08:15,943
- You okay brother?

165
00:08:15,978 --> 00:08:17,220
- Yeah.

166
00:08:17,255 --> 00:08:19,119
- Hiking is going to be
worse than this though.

167
00:08:19,153 --> 00:08:20,983
- Very good job today.

168
00:08:21,017 --> 00:08:22,432
I'm very proud of each

169
00:08:22,467 --> 00:08:24,607
and every one of you
guys for not quitting.

170
00:08:25,815 --> 00:08:27,265
- Ms. Pam you said
a little work out.

171
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:28,300
- Yeah. This was
a little work out.

172
00:08:28,335 --> 00:08:30,233
- Nah. No way.

173
00:08:30,268 --> 00:08:31,545
- You didn't think it
was a little work out?

174
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,339
- It was cool.
- Is this the easy stuff?

175
00:08:32,373 --> 00:08:33,789
- It's cool.

176
00:08:47,285 --> 00:08:49,908
- You memorize that just by
looking at the first letter.

177
00:08:49,943 --> 00:08:50,978
- Yeah.

178
00:08:51,013 --> 00:08:52,946
- Wow. I'm impressed.

179
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,119
That is crazy-

180
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:57,295
But you know, I'm
betting on going there.

181
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:59,193
I don't only want
to do good for me.

182
00:08:59,228 --> 00:09:01,920
I also, like my mom's
my encouragement.

183
00:09:01,955 --> 00:09:04,440
And I'm like if I could
get time knocked off

184
00:09:04,474 --> 00:09:06,925
and while doing
something that I like.

185
00:09:07,857 --> 00:09:09,031
That'd be like pretty cool.

186
00:09:10,239 --> 00:09:11,551
- I'll see you next time okay.

187
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:12,413
Keep it up.

188
00:10:01,842 --> 00:10:03,430
- And buckle your seat belt.

189
00:10:03,464 --> 00:10:05,259
- All right.
- All right.

190
00:10:12,025 --> 00:10:12,853
All right.

191
00:10:52,134 --> 00:10:53,100
- Technique.

192
00:11:21,819 --> 00:11:22,647
- Watch your step.

193
00:11:29,343 --> 00:11:30,586
Okay.

194
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:34,452
Your going to go ahead
and walk in the office.

195
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,598
- Rules and regulations.

196
00:11:42,632 --> 00:11:45,014
You know, I won't
go into every rule.

197
00:11:45,049 --> 00:11:48,431
You know, some of the more
common rule infractions

198
00:11:48,466 --> 00:11:50,019
on the dorm are like, you know

199
00:11:50,054 --> 00:11:51,745
being out of bounds,
is kind of a big one.

200
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,264
Horseplay is another big one.

201
00:11:53,298 --> 00:11:55,473
More serious like we
already mentioned.

202
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:56,750
Dirty drug test.

203
00:11:56,785 --> 00:11:58,648
So substance use or
possessing contraband

204
00:11:58,683 --> 00:12:00,858
like cell phones or
cell phone chargers.

205
00:12:00,892 --> 00:12:02,445
Those things.

206
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,620
So being here at fire camp,
you guys are both employees.

207
00:12:04,654 --> 00:12:06,967
So you'll be getting
a monthly paycheck.

208
00:12:07,002 --> 00:12:08,382
You both owe restitution.

209
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:12,214
So half of that will
go towards restitution

210
00:12:12,248 --> 00:12:13,456
and then you'll
keep the other half

211
00:12:13,491 --> 00:12:15,044
until your restitution
is paid off.

212
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:17,667
And then you keep
all your money.

213
00:12:17,702 --> 00:12:20,809
So when you get called to
an incident and fight a fire

214
00:12:20,843 --> 00:12:24,191
you'd be eligible to earn a
couple extra time cuts

215
00:12:24,226 --> 00:12:26,815
They can add up to an
initial eight days per month.

216
00:12:27,988 --> 00:12:29,818
Which can, you know
overtime can add up to

217
00:12:29,852 --> 00:12:31,267
a pretty significant amount.

218
00:12:32,234 --> 00:12:33,545
Yup. All right.

219
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,306
Paperwork's done.

220
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,307
How are you feeling?

221
00:12:36,341 --> 00:12:37,239
- I'm good.
- I'm good.

222
00:12:37,273 --> 00:12:38,136
- Any of that confuse you?

223
00:12:38,171 --> 00:12:39,206
- No.
- Little bit?

224
00:12:39,241 --> 00:12:40,518
No. Okay, good.

225
00:12:58,122 --> 00:12:59,261
- First thing you
probably noticed.

226
00:12:59,295 --> 00:13:00,434
We don't have the fences.

227
00:13:00,469 --> 00:13:01,953
We don't have the barbed wire.

228
00:13:03,092 --> 00:13:04,784
We don't have the
security vans out here.

229
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:06,924
We don't have a whole
lot of staff here.

230
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,995
So this is a program
for guys that have shown

231
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:10,341
that they can maintain it.

232
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,688
They don't need that
kind of supervision

233
00:13:12,722 --> 00:13:14,414
because if you did,
you couldn't be here.

234
00:13:14,448 --> 00:13:17,451
Okay. So it's definitely,
it's a privileged program.

235
00:13:17,486 --> 00:13:18,383
I'll show you the kitchen.

236
00:13:18,418 --> 00:13:19,350
Want to see the kitchen?

237
00:13:19,384 --> 00:13:20,523
You heard about the food?

238
00:13:20,558 --> 00:13:21,766
- Yeah, I heard about the food.

239
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,457
- Yeah. What'd you
hear about the food?

240
00:13:23,492 --> 00:13:24,286
- It's way better.

241
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,425
- Yeah?

242
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:26,426
- Yes, yes, yes.

243
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,289
Good timing.

244
00:13:28,877 --> 00:13:29,774
- I'm Captain Respree.

245
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,879
What's your name?

246
00:13:30,913 --> 00:13:32,190
- Alexander Bailon.

247
00:13:32,225 --> 00:13:33,191
- Alexander Bailon.
Where are you from?

248
00:13:33,226 --> 00:13:34,227
- San Jose, California.

249
00:13:34,261 --> 00:13:35,262
- All right.

250
00:13:35,297 --> 00:13:36,367
Okay. Captain Respree.

251
00:13:36,401 --> 00:13:37,368
- Eric Major.

252
00:13:37,402 --> 00:13:38,196
- Eric Major.

253
00:13:38,231 --> 00:13:39,370
- Fresno, California.

254
00:13:39,404 --> 00:13:40,267
- Fresno, California.
- That's right.

255
00:13:40,302 --> 00:13:41,199
- Nice to meet you gentlemen.

256
00:13:41,234 --> 00:13:42,407
- Nice to meet you too, sir.

257
00:13:42,442 --> 00:13:43,650
- On behalf of Cal Fire,
thank you very much

258
00:13:43,684 --> 00:13:44,858
for volunteering.
Coming out here.

259
00:13:44,893 --> 00:13:45,825
- Thank you for very much.

260
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:46,653
- This is very hard work.

261
00:13:46,687 --> 00:13:48,103
Very hard work.

262
00:13:48,137 --> 00:13:50,864
But we can't meet the mission
of protecting Californians

263
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:53,453
from wildfire without
volunteers like you.

264
00:13:53,487 --> 00:13:54,937
So thanks a lot.

265
00:13:56,456 --> 00:13:57,802
- What clothes do we use?

266
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,217
- For parole, wear like a shirt

267
00:13:59,252 --> 00:14:01,633
and button it all the way up.

268
00:14:06,984 --> 00:14:08,088
Hey, how does that feel?

269
00:14:08,123 --> 00:14:09,227
- Good.

270
00:14:09,262 --> 00:14:10,573
- You sure?

271
00:14:10,608 --> 00:14:12,230
You'd be able to work in
it and stuff like that.
Move around.

272
00:14:12,265 --> 00:14:13,438
- Yeah.
- Okay.

273
00:14:59,484 --> 00:15:00,796
- When I first got here.

274
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,177
I liked it because

275
00:15:02,211 --> 00:15:04,144
I was more comfortable
being outdoors

276
00:15:04,179 --> 00:15:06,319
and not having to be
in a cell all day.

277
00:15:07,837 --> 00:15:10,979
I was sentenced as an adult
when I was 16 years old.

278
00:15:11,013 --> 00:15:13,567
But because my earliest
possible release date was

279
00:15:13,602 --> 00:15:15,949
before my 21st birthday.

280
00:15:15,984 --> 00:15:18,400
I had a chance to stay in DJJ

281
00:15:18,434 --> 00:15:21,161
but I had to work
at the fire camp.

282
00:15:21,196 --> 00:15:22,922
So that's where I landed.

283
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:25,510
And thank God.

284
00:15:25,545 --> 00:15:28,341
Lucky I was lucky enough
to go to DJJ fire camp.

285
00:15:47,808 --> 00:15:49,500
At Pine Grove all
the staff like me.

286
00:15:49,534 --> 00:15:50,811
All the captains like me.

287
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,573
That makes me feel
like I'm at home.

288
00:15:55,195 --> 00:15:59,337
I got to transition back
to who my real family is

289
00:15:59,372 --> 00:16:01,443
and where my real home is.

290
00:16:39,446 --> 00:16:40,240
- Yep.

291
00:16:40,275 --> 00:16:41,069
When we get out.

292
00:16:41,103 --> 00:16:42,622
- What's our plans?

293
00:16:42,656 --> 00:16:44,451
- Like college or whatnot?

294
00:16:44,486 --> 00:16:47,489
Probably even end up doing
this when we get out.

295
00:16:47,523 --> 00:16:48,731
- Yeah.

296
00:16:52,494 --> 00:16:53,667
- Three? Four?

297
00:16:58,707 --> 00:17:00,433
- Yeah, I think training crew.

298
00:17:00,467 --> 00:17:02,573
- Some of the work is
too much for people

299
00:17:02,607 --> 00:17:04,057
when they roll up out of here

300
00:17:04,092 --> 00:17:05,610
like basically leave the camp.

301
00:17:09,787 --> 00:17:10,546
- Yeah.

302
00:17:22,006 --> 00:17:22,938
- Let them know man.

303
00:17:22,972 --> 00:17:24,284
- It's the top chef right here.

304
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,459
- You know what I'm saying.

305
00:17:26,493 --> 00:17:31,498
Act like you like it.
Act like you like it.

306
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,817
- I have to
say I've grown a lot.

307
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:42,958
Not only because I love to
firefight and work hard.

308
00:17:42,992 --> 00:17:47,169
But it's helped me
become a better worker.

309
00:17:47,204 --> 00:17:49,378
It's helped me become
a better person.

310
00:17:49,413 --> 00:17:51,311
It's taught me a
lot of discipline.

311
00:17:51,346 --> 00:17:52,899
It's been a long journey.

312
00:17:58,422 --> 00:18:01,632
what's weird is a
couple months ago.

313
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:04,566
I talked to my grandpa and
he's a very strict person.

314
00:18:05,498 --> 00:18:07,672
So when I first got arrested

315
00:18:07,707 --> 00:18:09,329
he was kind of mad at me.

316
00:18:09,364 --> 00:18:10,641
But after a while,
and he found out

317
00:18:10,675 --> 00:18:12,091
how good I was doing at camp.

318
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,645
You know, started talking
to him more and more.

319
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:15,853
And you know, my
grandpa's getting older

320
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:18,235
and I really miss him.

321
00:18:21,548 --> 00:18:22,653
There's a lot of
people that are waiting

322
00:18:22,687 --> 00:18:23,688
for me to come home.

323
00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:45,848
- I've done a lot of stupid
things during my life.

324
00:18:45,883 --> 00:18:49,576
My first committing
offense was 15.

325
00:18:49,611 --> 00:18:51,371
Possession of a stolen vehicle.

326
00:18:54,374 --> 00:18:55,444
When I started
doing these things

327
00:18:55,479 --> 00:18:57,929
I just started chasing the money

328
00:18:57,964 --> 00:19:00,139
and I started getting that like

329
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:01,588
feeling like I'm my own man.

330
00:19:01,623 --> 00:19:04,108
When I was still a child
still trying to grow up.

331
00:19:07,215 --> 00:19:08,216
My mom was shocked

332
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,045
when the cops came in the house.

333
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:12,703
She just started
breaking down, crying.

334
00:19:12,737 --> 00:19:13,531
And what'd you do?

335
00:19:13,566 --> 00:19:14,394
What'd you do?

336
00:19:15,568 --> 00:19:16,465
That hurt me a lot.

337
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:19,710
I just told her
I'm gonna be okay.

338
00:19:19,744 --> 00:19:20,538
I'm gonna be okay.

339
00:19:20,573 --> 00:19:21,436
I'm going to do good.

340
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,368
I'm going to run my program.

341
00:19:22,402 --> 00:19:24,266
See what I can do to get out.

342
00:19:24,301 --> 00:19:25,129
Don't worry about it.

343
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:25,992
I'll be out soon.

344
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:52,708
- Oh so frustrated bro.

345
00:19:56,781 --> 00:19:58,818
- Oh, frustrated right now bro.

346
00:19:58,852 --> 00:20:00,026
- You're frustrated?

347
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:03,236
- Mentally, spiritually
and emotionally bro.

348
00:20:03,271 --> 00:20:04,755
Frustrated.

349
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:05,618
Like.

350
00:20:06,826 --> 00:20:08,103
It's bad bro.

351
00:20:09,035 --> 00:20:10,243
- Huh.

352
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,108
- Bro, no. I don't want
to pass with you bro.

353
00:20:14,282 --> 00:20:15,110
- Why?

354
00:20:15,144 --> 00:20:16,145
- I already passed bro.

355
00:20:17,802 --> 00:20:18,941
This is like, I don't get it.

356
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:22,324
Cause she was on vacation.

357
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:24,533
But she told the other
captain it was all right.

358
00:20:24,568 --> 00:20:26,397
So now she did some
backward stuff.

359
00:20:27,847 --> 00:20:29,469
Now I'm back still
in training crew

360
00:20:29,504 --> 00:20:32,334
and I'm supposed to be on the
actual fire crew right now.

361
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,509
- I don't know.

362
00:20:44,001 --> 00:20:45,830
My name is Dominiq Porter.

363
00:20:45,865 --> 00:20:47,556
I'm 20 years old.

364
00:20:47,591 --> 00:20:49,455
My offense, a 245.

365
00:20:49,489 --> 00:20:51,180
Shooting at a
occupied vehicle.

366
00:20:52,112 --> 00:20:53,390
Criminal history.

367
00:20:53,424 --> 00:20:54,908
I have two priors.

368
00:20:54,943 --> 00:20:57,463
One for selling narcotics
on the school ground.

369
00:20:57,497 --> 00:20:59,810
And one for
residential burglary.

370
00:20:59,844 --> 00:21:01,881
I have three other siblings.

371
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,228
So it's four siblings in total.

372
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,885
Three of us are in jail.

373
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,887
Oldest brother got 18 years.

374
00:21:07,921 --> 00:21:10,165
And the one that's
right under me, got 12.

375
00:21:10,199 --> 00:21:11,373
I got seven.

376
00:21:11,408 --> 00:21:13,651
My dad been in and
out of prison since

377
00:21:13,686 --> 00:21:15,343
before I was born.

378
00:21:15,377 --> 00:21:16,999
Three positive traits.

379
00:21:17,034 --> 00:21:18,000
I'm hard working.

380
00:21:18,035 --> 00:21:18,829
I'm a leader.

381
00:21:18,863 --> 00:21:20,693
And I'm dedicated.

382
00:21:20,727 --> 00:21:22,004
I came to Pine Grove
cause I feel like

383
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:24,317
this is an opportunity
to learn something.

384
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:27,044
I can take everything
I learned here

385
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:29,909
and apply it to my
life when I get out.

386
00:21:29,943 --> 00:21:31,290
- Okay, go and have a seat.

387
00:21:32,463 --> 00:21:34,500
So I'm Captain Hutchinson.

388
00:21:34,534 --> 00:21:36,433
I'm almost 53 years old.

389
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:38,952
My offense.

390
00:21:38,987 --> 00:21:39,884
I don't have one.

391
00:21:40,782 --> 00:21:41,714
Criminal history.

392
00:21:41,748 --> 00:21:42,611
None.

393
00:21:42,646 --> 00:21:43,923
Do I have any kids?

394
00:21:43,957 --> 00:21:45,131
Just you guys.

395
00:21:45,165 --> 00:21:45,925
I know you're not kids

396
00:21:45,959 --> 00:21:47,133
but just you guys.

397
00:21:47,167 --> 00:21:48,859
No I don't have any kids.

398
00:21:48,893 --> 00:21:52,345
So positive traits, I'm fair
firm and consistent.

399
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,760
Okay. I'm going to be
a hard on you guys.

400
00:21:53,795 --> 00:21:55,314
But I'm gonna be hard
on you guys, for why?

401
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:56,970
Can you answer Mr. Porter?

402
00:21:58,213 --> 00:21:59,973
Why do you think I'm going
to be hard on you guys?

403
00:22:00,008 --> 00:22:01,768
- Cause she's not lowering
to our expectations.

404
00:22:01,803 --> 00:22:03,391
She going to bring
us up to hers.

405
00:22:03,425 --> 00:22:06,980
- Okay. The goal is to bring
you up and better you, right?

406
00:22:07,015 --> 00:22:08,361
Cause I'm going to. I
believe in you guys.

407
00:22:08,396 --> 00:22:09,811
And I want you to
believe in yourself

408
00:22:09,845 --> 00:22:12,123
so that you guys can be
successful in this program.

409
00:22:12,158 --> 00:22:12,952
Okay?

410
00:22:15,403 --> 00:22:17,474
You guys actually came
in in a really good time.

411
00:22:17,508 --> 00:22:20,718
When you guys leave
this training program

412
00:22:20,753 --> 00:22:22,824
we're going to be pretty
much starting to go to fires

413
00:22:22,858 --> 00:22:25,171
and you guys are gonna go
right out in the mix of it.

414
00:22:25,205 --> 00:22:28,105
Okay? Any questions about that?

415
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:29,209
- No Cap.
- No Cap.

416
00:22:35,699 --> 00:22:36,493
Small steps.

417
00:22:36,527 --> 00:22:37,459
Come on.

418
00:22:39,047 --> 00:22:40,738
Take smaller steps.

419
00:22:42,602 --> 00:22:43,569
Keep going!

420
00:22:47,642 --> 00:22:49,989
- Tool left-hand,
downhill side.

421
00:22:50,023 --> 00:22:51,887
- We did this, Bailon.
- I feel like I'm going to
pass out.

422
00:22:51,922 --> 00:22:52,923
Let's go guys!

423
00:22:52,957 --> 00:22:54,096
- That's the easy part.

424
00:22:54,131 --> 00:22:55,097
You heard it yesterday.

425
00:22:55,132 --> 00:22:57,099
As soon as I say, hook it up.
Get hooked up.

426
00:22:57,134 --> 00:22:58,687
Come on. Keep pushing.

427
00:22:58,722 --> 00:23:01,345
So small steps to
get that airway open.

428
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,381
Upper body straight.

429
00:23:06,246 --> 00:23:07,386
Push it out.

430
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,317
Solid finish.

431
00:23:16,325 --> 00:23:17,534
You should get your gloves on.

432
00:23:17,568 --> 00:23:19,052
I want you to pick up our tools

433
00:23:19,087 --> 00:23:20,709
and we'll get these. We'll
get loaded back on the bus.

434
00:24:30,227 --> 00:24:33,023
- Okay. So obviously by now

435
00:24:33,057 --> 00:24:34,507
you guys know
something's going on.

436
00:24:37,303 --> 00:24:39,719
Looks like our number
finally got called.

437
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:41,963
- We're going out?

438
00:24:47,934 --> 00:24:49,004
All right.

439
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:52,905
You guys know I
don't talk over you.

440
00:24:52,939 --> 00:24:56,080
Okay. Going direct
attack to the fire.

441
00:24:56,115 --> 00:24:58,945
Fires 400 acres in a drainage.

442
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,637
There's very few resources

443
00:25:00,671 --> 00:25:02,397
on it right now
because everything is

444
00:25:02,431 --> 00:25:06,643
you guys probably know, are
tied up already down south.

445
00:25:06,677 --> 00:25:10,232
Okay. They're desperate for
hand crews and we're it.

446
00:25:10,267 --> 00:25:11,406
Okay.

447
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,303
Copy?

448
00:25:12,338 --> 00:25:13,235
- Copy that.

449
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,133
- All right.

450
00:25:25,696 --> 00:25:27,733
- It's in a drainage
so it's ugly.

451
00:25:27,767 --> 00:25:30,080
Like fires in a drainage.

452
00:25:30,114 --> 00:25:32,082
You got two mountains like
that and a fire most likely

453
00:25:32,116 --> 00:25:33,566
has a chance of running up hill.

454
00:25:33,601 --> 00:25:35,085
It's going to be crazy.

455
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:37,156
Hopefully, I'm hoping
for it to be crazy.

456
00:25:38,606 --> 00:25:39,538
- Let's go!

457
00:25:51,791 --> 00:25:53,793
- You feel more
appreciated

458
00:25:53,828 --> 00:25:55,761
being out with Cal Fire.

459
00:25:55,795 --> 00:25:58,004
Nobody's like, Hey, look at
those people that are in jail.

460
00:25:58,039 --> 00:26:00,766
They're like, Hey look,
those firefighters, you know.

461
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,044
Seeing people, thank
you for your hard work.

462
00:26:03,078 --> 00:26:07,013
Thank you for saving our
houses and our businesses.

463
00:26:08,428 --> 00:26:10,845
When I get out, I do
want to be a firefighter.

464
00:26:12,053 --> 00:26:13,779
I talked to my captain
all the time about it

465
00:26:13,813 --> 00:26:15,574
and they're trying to help
me a lot with the, getting

466
00:26:15,608 --> 00:26:17,852
into the fire service, whether
it's the U.S. forest service

467
00:26:17,886 --> 00:26:18,749
or Cal Fire.

468
00:26:20,993 --> 00:26:22,995
I'm a felon so, I
mean, I don't know

469
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:25,653
if I'll be able to
get that cleared or.

470
00:26:25,687 --> 00:26:26,861
That's another thing
I'm going to work on

471
00:26:26,895 --> 00:26:27,793
when I get out.

472
00:26:27,827 --> 00:26:29,173
It's trying to expunge my record

473
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:33,108
or at least get my
felony dropped somehow.

474
00:27:16,393 --> 00:27:18,533
- When I got
to crew, you know

475
00:27:18,567 --> 00:27:20,673
I thought I was just going to
become like the second saw

476
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:22,571
or a puller or something.

477
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:28,198
Next thing I know my Captain

478
00:27:28,232 --> 00:27:29,820
put me on as first man.

479
00:27:32,236 --> 00:27:35,101
Well I think first man
represented a lot of leadership.

480
00:27:35,136 --> 00:27:36,931
He knows everything about fires.

481
00:27:36,965 --> 00:27:39,209
Helps supervise everybody while

482
00:27:39,243 --> 00:27:40,589
you know, they're working.

483
00:27:44,076 --> 00:27:45,422
My grandpa always taught me.

484
00:27:45,456 --> 00:27:46,699
You can delegate your jobs

485
00:27:46,734 --> 00:27:48,218
but you can't delegate
your responsibilities.

486
00:27:48,252 --> 00:27:51,428
And to me, everything about
the crew is my responsibility.

487
00:28:00,092 --> 00:28:03,095
- All right we're doing
a four foot scrape
from here to that tree.

488
00:28:03,129 --> 00:28:03,889
Movin'

489
00:28:03,923 --> 00:28:04,752
- Movin'

490
00:28:06,788 --> 00:28:09,480
So cutting line is basically
a fuel break.

491
00:28:10,827 --> 00:28:15,659
So the fire burns to your line,
hits the dirt and goes out.

492
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,941
You think of your family,
trying to get back to them.

493
00:28:21,976 --> 00:28:25,082
It motivates you to push
harder and to keep safe.

494
00:28:25,117 --> 00:28:27,326
So we can all go back
to where we came from.

495
00:28:29,569 --> 00:28:31,640
You got to make that
wider back there.

496
00:28:31,675 --> 00:28:32,641
Clean up that duff.

497
00:28:33,781 --> 00:28:36,507
- And then your last McCloud
gotta clean up the berm.

498
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,138
- It really only
takes 10 seconds

499
00:28:46,172 --> 00:28:48,519
and you can give your life away.

500
00:28:49,555 --> 00:28:51,005
- I was ditching school a lot.

501
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,939
And I was hanging around
with the wrong people.

502
00:28:53,973 --> 00:28:55,112
I didn't like going to school.

503
00:28:55,147 --> 00:28:56,700
That was my number
one pet peeve.

504
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,288
I didn't like going there.

505
00:28:58,322 --> 00:28:59,945
- I have strict parents.

506
00:28:59,979 --> 00:29:01,187
- Single mother.

507
00:29:01,222 --> 00:29:02,844
- I have a very
supportive family.

508
00:29:02,879 --> 00:29:05,744
It was just the
decisions I was making.

509
00:29:06,814 --> 00:29:08,781
- I was hiding a
lot from my mom.

510
00:29:08,816 --> 00:29:11,750
And so like that would like
make her cry and stuff.

511
00:29:11,784 --> 00:29:14,407
- Being part of the gang
it'd be like another family.

512
00:29:16,271 --> 00:29:17,100
- I was lost.

513
00:29:18,446 --> 00:29:20,137
I kind of felt like
everything was-

514
00:29:20,172 --> 00:29:22,174
All the pressure was
on me to do things.

515
00:29:22,208 --> 00:29:23,658
You know what I mean?

516
00:29:23,692 --> 00:29:26,661
- I was like, yeah, I'm
gonna start going to school.

517
00:29:26,695 --> 00:29:27,800
I'm gonna do better.

518
00:29:27,835 --> 00:29:29,422
I'm gonna quit smoking,
quit doing drugs.

519
00:29:30,561 --> 00:29:32,701
And then a week later.
On the same path.

520
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:37,914
- I wanted to be the
cool guy I guess.

521
00:29:37,948 --> 00:29:40,571
- I always tell my mom that
I'll never get arrested.

522
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,058
- Dude it hurts.

523
00:29:44,092 --> 00:29:48,062
Being away in jail, can't
explain it's like...

524
00:29:48,096 --> 00:29:50,064
I feel like I'm
not a big brother

525
00:29:50,098 --> 00:29:52,445
because a big brother's
supposed to be a role model.

526
00:29:58,313 --> 00:29:59,521
- 16.

527
00:29:59,556 --> 00:30:02,110
- I was 17 when I
committed my offense.

528
00:30:03,767 --> 00:30:06,045
- I was incarcerated
when I was 13 years old.

529
00:30:08,737 --> 00:30:09,566
- 16.

530
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:14,295
- I don't come
from a poor family.

531
00:30:15,468 --> 00:30:17,401
- We barely made ends meet.

532
00:30:17,436 --> 00:30:18,920
I hung out with a
lot of kids that come

533
00:30:18,955 --> 00:30:22,199
from wealthy families and they
had everything they ever had.

534
00:30:22,234 --> 00:30:23,304
Nike socks, dude.

535
00:30:23,338 --> 00:30:24,857
They had chucks.

536
00:30:24,892 --> 00:30:26,894
They had all the clothes.
All, everything I wanted.

537
00:30:26,928 --> 00:30:28,827
So I started hanging
around with those kids

538
00:30:28,861 --> 00:30:30,759
and come to find out
that their parents

539
00:30:30,794 --> 00:30:32,623
were buying everything.

540
00:30:33,935 --> 00:30:37,042
So I kind of fell into

541
00:30:37,076 --> 00:30:38,837
learning how to rob people.

542
00:30:40,493 --> 00:30:43,289
Go out on the weekend,
Friday night, you know

543
00:30:43,324 --> 00:30:44,566
when people get paid

544
00:30:44,601 --> 00:30:46,499
and see people coming
out of liquor stores

545
00:30:46,534 --> 00:30:48,432
'cause liquor stores cash checks

546
00:30:48,467 --> 00:30:50,952
and they turned the
corner in the dark alley.

547
00:30:50,987 --> 00:30:53,575
You get hit upside the
head and money took.

548
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:55,336
And next thing you know

549
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:58,753
I got five cop cars
coming from this street

550
00:30:58,787 --> 00:31:00,410
and I have nowhere to run.

551
00:31:00,444 --> 00:31:01,618
With the gun in my hand.

552
00:31:03,482 --> 00:31:04,448
Now that I look at it, dude.

553
00:31:05,794 --> 00:31:08,176
What a disgusting
human being I was.

554
00:31:08,211 --> 00:31:10,075
- I'll tell you that, you know

555
00:31:10,109 --> 00:31:13,699
as knowing how hard people
work for their money.

556
00:31:13,733 --> 00:31:15,977
How hard I worked
for my money now.

557
00:31:18,531 --> 00:31:19,670
- People make mistakes.

558
00:31:22,225 --> 00:31:23,812
I guess it's my fate.

559
00:31:28,127 --> 00:31:29,197
- Bumping by, bumping by.

560
00:31:29,853 --> 00:31:30,889
- Bumping by.

561
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,618
- Air tanker drop!

562
00:31:36,653 --> 00:31:37,826
Air tanker drop.

563
00:31:37,861 --> 00:31:41,002
- Twos to the left.
Twos to the left.

564
00:31:51,495 --> 00:31:52,289
Okay. Clear.

565
00:31:52,324 --> 00:31:53,152
Moving.

566
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,193
- Okay.

567
00:32:03,576 --> 00:32:04,853
Step one foot in it

568
00:32:06,683 --> 00:32:08,098
and then bring it around you.

569
00:32:11,688 --> 00:32:14,829
Like a coat. Feet
to the heat, right?

570
00:32:14,863 --> 00:32:16,555
Feet to the heat
and head to the red.

571
00:32:17,763 --> 00:32:19,351
Why don't you come
here for a second.

572
00:32:25,564 --> 00:32:26,392
Ah.

573
00:32:29,878 --> 00:32:31,294
What's going on?

574
00:32:33,296 --> 00:32:35,229
- Okay. Well they're
going to hurt.

575
00:32:35,263 --> 00:32:37,334
Remember you signed up for
being a firefighter.

576
00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:39,095
We'll be on our feet a lot.

577
00:32:39,129 --> 00:32:41,166
Okay. But I'm kind of sensing
a little sense of urgency.

578
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,684
Like lack of sense of urgency.

579
00:32:42,719 --> 00:32:46,757
Like you're just not really
caring right now. Okay.

580
00:32:46,792 --> 00:32:49,208
That thing right there is
going to save your life
in a burn over.

581
00:32:49,243 --> 00:32:51,417
Okay. Which means you
need to be moving.

582
00:32:51,452 --> 00:32:53,385
And moving now.

583
00:32:53,419 --> 00:32:54,696
Okay.

584
00:32:54,731 --> 00:32:56,008
That fire turns on us.

585
00:32:56,043 --> 00:32:57,078
It's coming at us.

586
00:33:03,395 --> 00:33:04,154
Ready?

587
00:33:05,397 --> 00:33:06,363
Okay.

588
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:07,226
Go.

589
00:33:20,412 --> 00:33:22,172
Two points of contact.

590
00:33:45,851 --> 00:33:47,059
Okay, come on up.

591
00:34:14,673 --> 00:34:16,192
I'm in LA county.

592
00:34:16,226 --> 00:34:17,124
He's from the bay.

593
00:34:19,712 --> 00:34:21,093
- Different cultures.

594
00:34:21,128 --> 00:34:22,681
- Different culture,
different teaching.

595
00:34:22,715 --> 00:34:23,544
Everything.

596
00:34:25,718 --> 00:34:26,512
- Different language.

597
00:34:26,547 --> 00:34:27,582
- Yup.

598
00:34:27,617 --> 00:34:28,997
- You know I haven't
had a peach since

599
00:34:29,032 --> 00:34:30,447
I've been locked up
until I got here.

600
00:34:30,482 --> 00:34:31,276
- A who?

601
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:32,863
- Peach.

602
00:34:32,898 --> 00:34:34,279
- I don't like peaches.

603
00:34:35,487 --> 00:34:36,971
- I like them.
- I like plums though.

604
00:34:37,005 --> 00:34:37,903
- Plums.

605
00:34:37,937 --> 00:34:39,491
- Uh.
- I like peeled grapes.

606
00:34:42,252 --> 00:34:43,081
- What?

607
00:34:44,323 --> 00:34:45,566
- Peeled grapes.

608
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,050
You never peeled a
grape and ate it?

609
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,155
- No.

610
00:34:48,189 --> 00:34:49,121
I'd just eat the grape.

611
00:34:49,156 --> 00:34:50,985
- You haven't lived life then.

612
00:34:51,019 --> 00:34:53,539
- No, you're just fat.

613
00:34:53,574 --> 00:34:54,402
- I'm fast.

614
00:34:56,611 --> 00:34:58,475
- We're going to do some
hand line construction

615
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,512
and pretty much this is
our bread and butter.

616
00:35:00,546 --> 00:35:01,478
This is what we do.

617
00:35:01,513 --> 00:35:02,928
This is what we're paid for.

618
00:35:02,962 --> 00:35:06,483
Okay. Remember we go
places that what can't-

619
00:35:06,518 --> 00:35:07,519
- Nobody.
- No go.

620
00:35:07,553 --> 00:35:08,554
Nobody else can go, right.

621
00:35:08,589 --> 00:35:10,004
Especially like the dozers.

622
00:35:10,038 --> 00:35:12,524
So we're going to
go four foot scrape.

623
00:35:12,558 --> 00:35:15,320
Okay. You're going to set the?

624
00:35:15,354 --> 00:35:16,838
- Line.
- The line.

625
00:35:16,873 --> 00:35:18,426
Okay. So you're going to
come into the edge, right.

626
00:35:19,186 --> 00:35:21,153
And what you're going to do

627
00:35:21,188 --> 00:35:22,361
is you're going to take

628
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,777
the first foot.

629
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:28,056
And it needs to be down to?

630
00:35:28,091 --> 00:35:29,265
Bare mineral dirt.

631
00:35:30,369 --> 00:35:31,957
- So third person coming in

632
00:35:32,958 --> 00:35:35,029
overlap the second guy.

633
00:35:35,063 --> 00:35:35,892
The second foot.

634
00:35:41,484 --> 00:35:42,312
Hm. What?

635
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:44,038
- Nothing.

636
00:35:44,072 --> 00:35:45,350
- What do you think?

637
00:35:45,384 --> 00:35:46,282
- I'm ready to do it.

638
00:35:46,316 --> 00:35:48,353
- Pretty intelligent, huh?

639
00:35:48,387 --> 00:35:49,526
Everybody gets
their piece of line.

640
00:35:49,561 --> 00:35:50,389
Does their part.

641
00:35:58,570 --> 00:35:59,778
How you're doing this.

642
00:35:59,812 --> 00:36:00,986
You're doing this
and you're actually

643
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,919
kind of making your work
a little bit harder.

644
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:04,092
Get in there with the tool.

645
00:36:04,127 --> 00:36:05,197
Put some pressure on it.

646
00:36:05,232 --> 00:36:06,267
And it's great.

647
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:10,547
Okay.

648
00:36:10,582 --> 00:36:12,135
You're letting it get
right here right now.

649
00:36:13,274 --> 00:36:14,965
Yeah. It's getting in
your head right now.

650
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,759
I can see it.

651
00:36:15,794 --> 00:36:16,898
I can hear it.

652
00:36:16,933 --> 00:36:18,210
Don't let it get in your head.

653
00:36:18,245 --> 00:36:19,349
Okay.

654
00:36:19,384 --> 00:36:21,179
You signed up for this, right?
You volunteered for it.

655
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,458
Right?

656
00:36:24,492 --> 00:36:25,493
Okay. So did I.

657
00:36:25,528 --> 00:36:26,529
That's why I'm here.

658
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,118
Let's just say we volunteered
for this together.

659
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:32,397
Right?

660
00:36:32,431 --> 00:36:34,778
Okay. Don't let it
get in your head.

661
00:36:34,813 --> 00:36:36,297
We're going to be out
there on that fire line.

662
00:36:36,332 --> 00:36:38,265
And we're going to do
thousands of feet of this.

663
00:36:38,299 --> 00:36:40,025
Thousands and thousands of feet.

664
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:42,027
Okay. This is our job.

665
00:36:42,061 --> 00:36:42,993
This is what we do.

666
00:36:57,249 --> 00:36:58,285
Hey, don't pet it.

667
00:36:58,319 --> 00:36:59,769
It's not a puppy

668
00:36:59,803 --> 00:37:01,495
Get that tool in and use it.

669
00:37:15,992 --> 00:37:18,270
When you look back at
the work that gets done.

670
00:37:18,305 --> 00:37:19,202
It's impressive.

671
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,308
The work that they can do.

672
00:37:23,206 --> 00:37:24,966
One of the cool things

673
00:37:25,001 --> 00:37:27,555
about these guys
versus the adults.

674
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,488
Is as long as there's work to do

675
00:37:29,523 --> 00:37:31,352
they typically will keep going.

676
00:37:31,387 --> 00:37:33,320
I mean, that's
what I have found.

677
00:37:33,354 --> 00:37:35,632
And they get that recognition
when we're out there.

678
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:36,978
We want the Pine
Grove crews out there

679
00:37:37,013 --> 00:37:39,118
because these guys
will work until

680
00:37:40,016 --> 00:37:41,189
they can't anymore.

681
00:37:43,537 --> 00:37:45,677
The big key of it is
them working together.

682
00:37:59,898 --> 00:38:02,003
- Okay. Division, Romeo, Whiskey
things are looking real good.

683
00:38:02,038 --> 00:38:03,764
There's still some showing up.

684
00:38:03,798 --> 00:38:05,283
Heat showing up on the IR.

685
00:38:19,918 --> 00:38:20,919
- All right.

686
00:38:44,908 --> 00:38:46,703
- There you go.

687
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,154
That's a lot of fire.

688
00:39:02,098 --> 00:39:04,307
- Get it locked and
scattered way out there.

689
00:39:06,792 --> 00:39:08,415
Firing 75 Golf, Go ahead.

690
00:39:28,158 --> 00:39:30,160
- To go make a berm.
- Yea?

691
00:39:30,195 --> 00:39:31,645
- We got to throw
everything back that way.

692
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:35,442
But not. Don't make piles.
Make a long wood row.

693
00:39:35,476 --> 00:39:37,927
So when we light
this off. It takes.

694
00:39:37,961 --> 00:39:38,755
- Going up.

695
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:39,687
- All this.

696
00:39:41,137 --> 00:39:42,621
Going this way, yeah.

697
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:48,869
- It's not about being
physically prepared.

698
00:39:48,903 --> 00:39:50,698
To do it. It's a lot of mental.

699
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,501
- This patch.

700
00:40:04,747 --> 00:40:05,575
- All right.

701
00:40:07,025 --> 00:40:08,820
- With Cal Fire they-

702
00:40:08,854 --> 00:40:10,787
Things changed within seconds.

703
00:40:10,822 --> 00:40:14,412
You just gotta be prepared
to adapt, to change.

704
00:40:28,495 --> 00:40:29,634
- Yep. Like right now.

705
00:40:29,668 --> 00:40:30,842
Hey!

706
00:40:30,876 --> 00:40:31,877
Pull back!

707
00:40:31,912 --> 00:40:32,913
Pull back now!

708
00:40:32,947 --> 00:40:35,363
- Pull back!

709
00:40:40,299 --> 00:40:41,473
- The fire that's
down below us though.

710
00:40:41,508 --> 00:40:42,681
Looks very innocent

711
00:40:44,096 --> 00:40:45,684
a mere 20 minutes ago

712
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:47,341
is now blown up.

713
00:40:47,375 --> 00:40:49,861
And this area is going
to become untenable.

714
00:40:50,689 --> 00:40:51,690
So.

715
00:40:51,794 --> 00:40:53,796
We need to leave
right now.

716
00:40:56,143 --> 00:40:57,765
We'll be in good shape.
They're kicking everybody out.

717
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,946
- I'm about to go
home and it feels like

718
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,775
it feels like I'm a young kid

719
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:19,467
at home and who's getting
kicked out by his parents.

720
00:42:21,193 --> 00:42:22,436
I just can't stop.

721
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:23,092
There's something
that's telling me.

722
00:42:23,126 --> 00:42:23,920
I can't stop.

723
00:42:23,955 --> 00:42:24,818
I got to go home.

724
00:42:24,852 --> 00:42:26,578
I got to get into an EMT class.

725
00:42:26,613 --> 00:42:29,547
I got to go through academy
and I got to work for Cal Fire.

726
00:42:29,581 --> 00:42:30,686
I can't stop.

727
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,790
There's nothing that's
going to stop me

728
00:42:31,825 --> 00:42:33,481
when I get out.

729
00:42:59,646 --> 00:43:00,923
- Come through.

730
00:43:03,442 --> 00:43:04,443
- That's it.

731
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:08,724
Thank you sir.

732
00:43:20,874 --> 00:43:23,428
Gentleman. At this
time, you need to be
behind the red line.

733
00:43:23,462 --> 00:43:24,602
- Please?

734
00:43:24,636 --> 00:43:25,464

00:43:43,759 --> 00:43:44,622
- Bye Cap.

742
00:43:48,108 --> 00:43:50,041
- Here. We just went
to a bullshit fire roll today.

743
00:43:50,075 --> 00:43:51,525
- If you could do
it over here, bro

744
00:43:51,559 --> 00:43:53,182
Where I'm at, you
can do it easily.

745
00:43:53,216 --> 00:43:55,115
I don't even put 'em out
now I be just chilling.

746
00:43:55,149 --> 00:43:56,185
- Right here.

747
00:43:56,219 --> 00:43:57,635
- I don't want to be-

748
00:43:57,669 --> 00:43:58,843
- So how much do
y'all get paid a week?

749
00:43:58,877 --> 00:44:00,361
- Every two weeks,
you get $3000.

750
00:44:00,396 --> 00:44:01,915
- $3000!

751
00:44:01,949 --> 00:44:04,227
Hell yes.
That's living.

752
00:44:04,262 --> 00:44:05,850
- It's not like you get
paid different for it.

753
00:44:05,884 --> 00:44:06,678
You get paid the same.

754
00:44:06,713 --> 00:44:07,748
Whether you want to saw.

755
00:44:07,783 --> 00:44:08,680
- Everybody gets paid the same?

756
00:44:08,715 --> 00:44:09,681
- Everybody get paid the same.

757
00:44:09,716 --> 00:44:10,889
They ain't no like,

758
00:44:10,924 --> 00:44:12,684
Oh well I'm gonna saw, I
get fuckin' 3 more dollars.
No.

759
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:14,203
- And I got experience too.

760
00:44:14,237 --> 00:44:15,238
- Correct.

761
00:44:24,489 --> 00:44:25,455
- I'm a registered gang member.

762
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:26,318
- Yeah?

763
00:44:26,353 --> 00:44:27,112
- Yeah.
- I'm good then.

764
00:44:27,147 --> 00:44:28,044
- It don't matter.

765
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:29,425
They don't, they don't stop you

766
00:44:29,459 --> 00:44:30,978
from fighting fire for no gang.

767
00:44:36,846 --> 00:44:38,952
- Yeah. My name is
Antoinio Wellington.

768
00:44:38,986 --> 00:44:41,402
I work for the U.S.
Forest Service.

769
00:44:41,437 --> 00:44:44,509
I'm going on my second season
with the U.S. Forest Service.

770
00:44:44,543 --> 00:44:48,271
I was incarcerated in
Pine Grove for two years

771
00:44:48,306 --> 00:44:50,688
from 2015 to 2017.

772
00:44:50,722 --> 00:44:52,828
I was the first man on crew two.

773
00:44:54,001 --> 00:44:56,417
When I got outta here,
I was just chilling

774
00:44:56,452 --> 00:44:57,729
working a couple of jobs.

775
00:44:57,764 --> 00:45:00,076
And then I met a guy
who helped me apply

776
00:45:00,111 --> 00:45:02,423
for a job with the
U.S. Forest Service.

777
00:45:02,458 --> 00:45:04,909
And I waited for about
a year and they told me

778
00:45:04,943 --> 00:45:07,601
that I needed to
report in 17 days

779
00:45:07,635 --> 00:45:09,085
to the U.S. Forest Service.

780
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,848
So if any of you guys are
looking to get a career

781
00:45:12,882 --> 00:45:14,504
or like establish yourselves

782
00:45:14,539 --> 00:45:15,747
when you get out of here.

783
00:45:15,782 --> 00:45:17,749
The work that you guys
are doing inside of here

784
00:45:17,784 --> 00:45:20,165
could really factor
to when you get out.

785
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,927
And it's so simple
to get a job working

786
00:45:22,961 --> 00:45:24,618
on an actual hand crew

787
00:45:24,652 --> 00:45:27,276
and they don't care about
none of us being on parole.

788
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:30,106
They don't care about the
past life that we lived.

789
00:45:30,141 --> 00:45:31,383
They don't care
about none of that.

790
00:45:31,418 --> 00:45:32,971
All they want is for
you guys to come out

791
00:45:33,006 --> 00:45:35,698
and show that you guys
got some work ethic.

792
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,943
Come out there and do what
you already know what to do.

793
00:45:38,977 --> 00:45:42,532
Is any of you guys in here
interested in getting into fire?

794
00:45:42,567 --> 00:45:43,361
Okay.

795
00:45:43,395 --> 00:45:44,189
We've got some ones.

796
00:45:44,224 --> 00:45:45,673
Okay. That's good.

797
00:45:45,708 --> 00:45:47,745
Listen to everything your
captain is telling you

798
00:45:47,779 --> 00:45:49,712
even though you might
not feel it's right.

799
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,645
I done been through
everything that y'all going

800
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:53,751
through in here with
the captains and feeling

801
00:45:53,785 --> 00:45:56,305
like you're slaves and feeling
like y'all being overworked

802
00:45:56,339 --> 00:45:57,858
because y'all ain't
making enough money.

803
00:45:57,893 --> 00:46:00,136
I done been there but
I'm here to tell you

804
00:46:00,171 --> 00:46:03,312
that it don't matter how
hard they work you right now.

805
00:46:03,346 --> 00:46:05,486
When you get out and
you go to get a job.

806
00:46:05,521 --> 00:46:06,971
You're already going
to be prepared.

807
00:46:07,005 --> 00:46:09,318
Cause you can already work
under the worst conditions.

808
00:46:09,352 --> 00:46:12,666
Sleeping outside.
Bugs crawling on you.

809
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,047
It wasn't easy.

810
00:46:14,081 --> 00:46:14,979
But you know what I mean?

811
00:46:15,013 --> 00:46:16,325
I made it. I'm here right now.

812
00:46:16,359 --> 00:46:17,671
I'm here talking to y'all.

813
00:46:17,705 --> 00:46:19,259
I care about every one of y'all.

814
00:46:19,293 --> 00:46:20,778
I did sat in these hard backs.

815
00:46:20,812 --> 00:46:23,332
I done watched this TV and
I'm played on that yard.

816
00:46:23,366 --> 00:46:24,540
I'm just letting you know,

817
00:46:24,574 --> 00:46:27,232
I'm living proof that
you could be successful

818
00:46:27,267 --> 00:46:29,441
and do something
with yourselves.

819
00:46:37,656 --> 00:46:39,797
Love comes from me being
in the same position

820
00:46:39,831 --> 00:46:41,626
that they were, that
they're in right now.

821
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:43,628
I understand it. I can feel some

822
00:46:43,662 --> 00:46:45,561
of their emotions
still to this day

823
00:46:45,595 --> 00:46:47,011
of what they're going through.

824
00:46:47,045 --> 00:46:48,736
The stress, the
anxiety, the fear.

825
00:46:48,771 --> 00:46:51,222
The not knowing what
to do with their lives.

826
00:46:53,431 --> 00:46:56,399

00:46:56,434 --> 00:46:57,745

- Ohh. Yeah.

00:49:39,424 --> 00:49:43,877

Love.

- I'll probably see
you next Sunday.

869
00:52:03,913 --> 00:52:05,501
- Some people take
longer than others.

870
00:52:05,536 --> 00:52:06,364
- Probably.

871
00:52:11,714 --> 00:52:13,682

It's for the better.

Yeah.

00:52:44,644 --> 00:52:46,232
Watch out this part right there.

875
00:52:52,238 --> 00:52:53,860
- What are you doing man?

876
00:52:55,862 --> 00:52:59,486
Slow down a little bit.

877
00:52:59,521 --> 00:53:01,108
- He's dead.

878
00:53:06,044 --> 00:53:06,838
- Okay.

879
00:53:06,873 --> 00:53:07,805
Let's redo this.

880
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:08,944
- Oh yeah.
- Why?

881
00:53:08,978 --> 00:53:10,048
- You killed him.

882
00:53:10,083 --> 00:53:11,395
- Because I'm gonna
ask you to redo it.

883
00:53:11,429 --> 00:53:12,327
- Ain't nothing wrong with it.

884
00:53:12,361 --> 00:53:13,569
I did it right the first time.

885
00:53:13,604 --> 00:53:14,398
- No you didn't.

886
00:53:14,432 --> 00:53:15,295
- All right.

887
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:17,021
Anyway. Are you all right?

888
00:53:17,055 --> 00:53:17,953
You all right?

889
00:53:37,973 --> 00:53:38,939
- Okay.

890
00:53:49,364 --> 00:53:51,262
- Did it right the
first time, bro.

891
00:53:51,297 --> 00:53:54,127
- Are you okay?
- It's not hard.

892
00:53:54,161 --> 00:53:55,473
- Got to lock your fingers.

893
00:53:56,716 --> 00:53:58,338
- I got everything.

894
00:54:00,754 --> 00:54:02,687
- I mean, he got an attitude.

895
00:54:02,722 --> 00:54:03,964
He's like, I know how to do it.

896
00:54:03,999 --> 00:54:05,345
And when I moved on
to the next person

897
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:06,553
and he was just like

898
00:54:06,588 --> 00:54:08,314
I know how to do this.
I was a lifeguard.

899
00:54:08,348 --> 00:54:10,626
You know, and he's kind
of got this total chip

900
00:54:10,661 --> 00:54:12,076
on his shoulder.

901
00:54:12,110 --> 00:54:13,491
And he's still mad about it.

902
00:54:15,424 --> 00:54:17,288
He's being disruptive.

903
00:54:17,323 --> 00:54:18,531
- What do you want to do?

904
00:54:18,565 --> 00:54:21,672
Well I'm gonna have to
run it through the boss.

905
00:54:21,706 --> 00:54:22,914
But-

906
00:54:22,949 --> 00:54:24,640
- Because if that's the case,
he needs to just be rolled out

907
00:54:24,675 --> 00:54:26,021
and he needs to go back
to the institution.

908
00:54:26,055 --> 00:54:27,954
- Yeah. I mean, that
was uncalled for.

909
00:54:29,783 --> 00:54:30,991
Because I'm not going
to reward somebody

910
00:54:31,026 --> 00:54:32,476
even if they pass everything.

911
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:34,823
If they're going to get on
there and have a bad attitude.

912
00:54:34,857 --> 00:54:36,480
And that's a concern for me.

913
00:54:36,514 --> 00:54:38,378
Putting them on, out on a bus.

914
00:55:08,235 --> 00:55:09,098
- Status.

915
00:55:09,133 --> 00:55:12,136
8 Units. 14 engines. 8 crews.

916
00:55:20,938 --> 00:55:24,631
- Maybe, I'll
get out in front.

917
00:55:24,666 --> 00:55:26,219
- Right now?

918
00:55:40,302 --> 00:55:41,614
Aqua.

919
00:55:41,648 --> 00:55:43,409
- Water the night
before you hike, bro.
Hella that shit, bro.

920
00:55:43,443 --> 00:55:44,271
- This ain't nothing, bro.

921
00:55:44,306 --> 00:55:45,100
- You drink hella water.

922
00:55:45,134 --> 00:55:46,722
You're going to be good.

923
00:55:46,757 --> 00:55:48,966
- Drank five liters yesterday.

924
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,762
- I don't even
feel the humidity.

925
00:55:52,694 --> 00:55:53,660
I just feel regular.

926
00:56:11,782 --> 00:56:13,128
- I think this is
actually the one.

927
00:56:26,348 --> 00:56:27,349
Hey 4489.

928
00:56:33,079 --> 00:56:33,873
- Swinging.

929
00:56:36,531 --> 00:56:37,359
Swinging.

930
00:56:38,981 --> 00:56:40,535
- There
you go. Make sure that
that hand comes all the way

931
00:56:40,569 --> 00:56:41,398
down to the other one.

932
00:56:41,432 --> 00:56:42,226
- Swinging.

933
00:56:45,229 --> 00:56:46,023
- Swinging.

934
00:56:47,507 --> 00:56:50,821
Try to build a little bit
of, little bit of bend
in that right elbow.

935
00:56:51,822 --> 00:56:52,995
- Swinging.

936
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:54,825
- There you go.

937
00:56:54,859 --> 00:56:55,757
- Swinging.

938
00:57:00,658 --> 00:57:01,487
- Leftmeyer.

939
00:57:06,284 --> 00:57:07,907
- You don't want it
to be like gapped.

940
00:57:21,265 --> 00:57:22,162
- Probation.

941
00:57:22,197 --> 00:57:24,371
want to talk to me.

942
00:57:25,614 --> 00:57:26,650
- That's odd.

943
00:57:26,684 --> 00:57:27,685
- Yeah it is, but.

944
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:28,652
You'll see.

945
00:57:28,686 --> 00:57:29,929
- You guys doing cutting now?

946
00:57:33,484 --> 00:57:34,416
- Swinging.

947
00:58:09,831 --> 00:58:12,523
Did you copy that
training crew is returning?

948
00:58:12,558 --> 00:58:14,663
- Copy.

949
00:58:15,561 --> 00:58:16,527
Moving.

950
00:58:16,562 --> 00:58:17,942
- Moving.

951
00:58:17,977 --> 00:58:19,530
- Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate.

952
00:58:19,565 --> 00:58:21,221
No stress.

953
00:58:21,256 --> 00:58:23,914
- I'm about to eat one tonight.

954
00:58:58,396 --> 00:58:59,397
- Here it is.

955
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,021
No more bus.

956
00:59:04,299 --> 00:59:05,300
- Hey!
- Hey!

957
00:59:05,852 --> 00:59:06,681
- Chuy!

958
00:59:06,957 --> 00:59:07,785
- Hey!

959
00:59:13,619 --> 00:59:15,862
- Ready to
check this shit in?

960
00:59:15,897 --> 00:59:16,725
Or stuff.

961
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:27,391
And that's, that's everything.

962
00:59:29,324 --> 00:59:31,326
- Somewhere where you're wanted

963
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:32,741
and comforted by people.

964
00:59:34,191 --> 00:59:36,296
Somewhere where you could go and

965
00:59:36,331 --> 00:59:39,783
and somebody, no matter
what, somebody will

966
00:59:39,817 --> 00:59:41,405
always welcome you.

967
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:42,337
That's home to me.

968
00:59:43,372 --> 00:59:45,823
And it's weird

969
00:59:47,376 --> 00:59:48,999
because I've been at
Pine Grove for so long

970
00:59:49,033 --> 00:59:52,036
that sometimes I feel
like that's my home

971
00:59:52,071 --> 00:59:53,348
because I don't

972
00:59:53,382 --> 00:59:55,557
I don't remember where
home is on the outs.

973
00:59:58,180 --> 00:59:59,181
- Yeah.
- We're good.

974
00:59:59,216 --> 01:00:00,113
We're good.

975
01:00:01,252 --> 01:00:02,184
- Good memories.

976
01:00:10,365 --> 01:00:11,815
Never thought this
day would come.

977
01:00:11,849 --> 01:00:13,540
Then here it is.

978
01:00:14,749 --> 01:00:15,681
Kind of feels like

979
01:00:17,234 --> 01:00:18,822
like for the last four years

980
01:00:18,856 --> 01:00:20,755
I've tried to prepare
myself for it.

981
01:00:20,789 --> 01:00:24,931
But, when it's here. Like
now that it's finally here

982
01:00:24,966 --> 01:00:26,450
it feels like I'm so unprepared.

983
01:00:26,484 --> 01:00:27,727
It's not even funny.

984
01:00:27,762 --> 01:00:29,556
- How are you unprepared though?

985
01:00:29,591 --> 01:00:31,524
You got everything
you could imagine.

986
01:00:31,558 --> 01:00:33,008
You got a little bit of
money, starts you off.

987
01:00:33,043 --> 01:00:34,665
You got a house over your head

988
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:36,184
and you got a better start

989
01:00:36,218 --> 01:00:39,290
than probably a lot of more
people that's out there.

990
01:00:39,325 --> 01:00:42,569
And you just got to realize
what's in front of you.

991
01:00:42,604 --> 01:00:44,364
- It's only, what's
different though is.

992
01:00:44,399 --> 01:00:46,366
Like, when you get out there.

993
01:00:46,401 --> 01:00:47,609
It's like, I don't know

994
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:48,783
if there's anything
to look forward to.

995
01:00:48,817 --> 01:00:50,543
Like here. Being
here after so long,

996
01:00:50,577 --> 01:00:52,234
it's like, you have one
thing to look forward to.

997
01:00:52,269 --> 01:00:53,408
And that's going home.

998
01:00:54,685 --> 01:00:55,893
When you get out there.

999
01:00:55,928 --> 01:00:57,654
So what's there to
look forward to?

1000
01:00:57,688 --> 01:00:58,862
A job. And then after what?

1001
01:00:58,896 --> 01:01:00,277
That is what? Vacation?

1002
01:01:01,588 --> 01:01:02,589
And then retirement?

1003
01:01:04,074 --> 01:01:05,040
I don't know.

1004
01:01:05,075 --> 01:01:06,386
It's a lot better though.

1005
01:01:06,421 --> 01:01:07,871
It's whatever.

1006
01:01:07,905 --> 01:01:09,079
- Money.

1007
01:01:09,113 --> 01:01:10,252
- Money.

1008
01:01:10,287 --> 01:01:11,598
- Way more money.

1009
01:01:11,633 --> 01:01:12,427
- Money.

1010
01:01:30,928 --> 01:01:32,412
- It's hard out there.

1011
01:01:32,447 --> 01:01:34,242
We got to realize, you know

1012
01:01:34,276 --> 01:01:36,831
no matter how good we got
it in here, no matter how

1013
01:01:36,865 --> 01:01:38,729
how "safe" it is in here.

1014
01:01:38,764 --> 01:01:40,835
We still got to go
back out there one day.

1015
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:45,287
You got to remember about your
decision-making, you know?

1016
01:01:45,322 --> 01:01:47,738
And you gotta, you
gotta, you know,

1017
01:01:47,773 --> 01:01:48,981
make good decisions.

1018
01:01:50,465 --> 01:01:51,362
Don't get in the car.

1019
01:01:51,397 --> 01:01:52,674
If somebody has a gun.

1020
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,503
You just gotta, you gotta

1021
01:01:55,815 --> 01:01:59,267
you gotta separate yourself
from the bad people

1022
01:01:59,301 --> 01:02:01,510
and surround yourself
around positive people.

1023
01:02:03,202 --> 01:02:04,444
- Nah, I just.

1024
01:02:04,479 --> 01:02:05,963
I got a problem with that.

1025
01:02:05,998 --> 01:02:09,139
Like I can't leave
everybody behind.

1026
01:02:10,312 --> 01:02:12,452
Like people you
came up with is is.

1027
01:02:12,487 --> 01:02:13,730
- Oh yeah, it ain't-

1028
01:02:13,764 --> 01:02:14,938
- And there's certain
times, like he said

1029
01:02:14,972 --> 01:02:16,456
don't get in the car
with somebody got a gun.

1030
01:02:16,491 --> 01:02:18,286
At the same time, sometimes.

1031
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:19,874
Sometimes that's necessary.

1032
01:02:21,323 --> 01:02:24,326
And I don't, it's just hard
to say no, just say no.

1033
01:02:39,376 --> 01:02:41,136
Waking up on that day.

1034
01:02:41,171 --> 01:02:42,172
Just like, damn.

1035
01:02:43,449 --> 01:02:44,312
I made it to see 19.

1036
01:02:44,346 --> 01:02:45,313
And it's crazy.

1037
01:02:45,347 --> 01:02:46,279
Like, you know.

1038
01:02:47,522 --> 01:02:49,317
I can't believe like
I'm at where I'm at.

1039
01:02:49,351 --> 01:02:51,388
But glad I'm at where I'm at.

1040
01:02:51,422 --> 01:02:55,081
I'm still seeing
myself, three years ago.

1041
01:02:55,116 --> 01:02:56,289
Out there doing
what I was doing.

1042
01:02:56,324 --> 01:02:57,601
And then now adapting to.

1043
01:02:57,635 --> 01:02:59,499
All right now I'm getting
out every morning for a job.

1044
01:02:59,534 --> 01:03:00,777
Now I'm doing this.
Now I'm working.

1045
01:03:00,811 --> 01:03:02,192
Now I got to get in this.

1046
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:04,988
Understanding now.

1047
01:03:05,022 --> 01:03:08,370
Life, was all going however
fast you want to go.

1048
01:03:08,405 --> 01:03:09,786
- It started with one school

1049
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:11,339
and working outside of Stockton.

1050
01:03:11,373 --> 01:03:13,272
And then once I
have enough money.

1051
01:03:13,306 --> 01:03:14,549
Just get out of there.

1052
01:03:14,583 --> 01:03:16,758
That's what, that's
what I'm going to do.

1053
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,208
And being able to-

1054
01:03:18,242 --> 01:03:19,623
- That's the scary part.
Cause you don't know,
what's waiting for you.

1055
01:03:19,657 --> 01:03:20,831
Who waiting for you?

1056
01:03:20,866 --> 01:03:22,453
What people remember
you? Who don't?

1057
01:03:36,847 --> 01:03:38,538
- All
right, breakfast in 20 minutes.

1058
01:03:38,573 --> 01:03:40,299
20 minutes 'til breakfast.

1059
01:03:52,138 --> 01:03:52,967
- Just go home, bro.

1060
01:04:08,810 --> 01:04:10,605
- Just take my boots.

1061
01:04:12,641 --> 01:04:15,506
All right bros, I'm gone

1062
01:04:15,541 --> 01:04:18,233
Oh I'm no good at
saying bye to people.

1063
01:04:19,269 --> 01:04:20,753
- Get out of here.
- Don't stay up.

1064
01:04:20,787 --> 01:04:22,410
All right. And I'll
see yous out there.

1065
01:04:28,519 --> 01:04:29,866
I'm free!

1066
01:04:33,662 --> 01:04:35,147
I'm ready to kick
it to the curb.

1067
01:04:35,181 --> 01:04:36,148
It's been too long.

1068
01:04:36,182 --> 01:04:37,770
You know I think
it's time for me

1069
01:04:37,804 --> 01:04:40,393
to start a new
chapter in my life.

1070
01:04:43,949 --> 01:04:45,088
- Yeah.

1071
01:04:47,469 --> 01:04:48,919
- You got his stuff?

1072
01:04:48,954 --> 01:04:51,094
- You got that letter. You
got my information, bro.

1073
01:04:51,128 --> 01:04:52,785
Hit me, ASAP.

1074
01:04:57,755 --> 01:04:59,516
- It'll be cool, bro.

1075
01:05:01,828 --> 01:05:02,829
You good, bro.

1076
01:05:02,864 --> 01:05:03,623
Stop trippin'.

1077
01:05:03,658 --> 01:05:05,280
Just do your time.

1078
01:05:05,315 --> 01:05:06,661
Keep working with Drummond.

1079
01:05:07,662 --> 01:05:09,836
And you'll be good, bro.

1080
01:05:09,871 --> 01:05:11,631
It'll be good.

1081
01:05:14,703 --> 01:05:15,739
My business card.

1082
01:05:15,773 --> 01:05:16,671
Yep. That's her.

1083
01:05:16,705 --> 01:05:17,879
That's my mum right there.

1084
01:05:27,854 --> 01:05:28,994
- What's up strangers?

1085
01:05:29,028 --> 01:05:30,305
- Hi there.

1086
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:31,548
- Hello.
- Hi baby.

1087
01:05:32,445 --> 01:05:33,515
Oh my goodness.

1088
01:05:35,517 --> 01:05:36,760
- There you go.

1089
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:39,073
- Oh man.

1090
01:05:39,107 --> 01:05:40,833
- All right buddy.

1091
01:05:40,867 --> 01:05:42,731
You take it easy.
- Yep.

1092
01:05:42,766 --> 01:05:44,561
- Call me. Let me know
if you need anything.

1093
01:05:44,595 --> 01:05:48,358
- Be good.

1094
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:53,501
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1095
01:05:55,986 --> 01:05:56,849
- All right.

1096
01:05:56,883 --> 01:05:58,264
- Thank you guys.

1097
01:06:00,439 --> 01:06:02,751
- Chuy! My boy!

1098
01:06:02,786 --> 01:06:04,201
- All right, bro.

1099
01:06:32,919 --> 01:06:34,059
- Bailon.

1100
01:06:34,093 --> 01:06:35,025
- 95412.

1101
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:36,578
- Sherman.

1102
01:06:38,408 --> 01:06:41,307
- Jones.

1103
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:44,276
- 94738.

1104
01:06:45,242 --> 01:06:46,036
- Moving.

1105
01:06:46,071 --> 01:06:46,899
Straight line.

1106
01:06:46,933 --> 01:06:47,762
- Movin'

1107
01:07:10,854 --> 01:07:13,167
- Okay. You guys, do
your time test hike.

1108
01:07:14,306 --> 01:07:16,446
And your time will
stop when you hit

1109
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:17,447
when you touch the bus.

1110
01:07:17,481 --> 01:07:18,758
When you come in.

1111
01:07:18,793 --> 01:07:21,002
Right. And I'm
confident that every one

1112
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:22,486
of you guys can do this.

1113
01:07:22,521 --> 01:07:24,040
Okay.

1114
01:07:24,074 --> 01:07:26,145
Make sure you guys are using
proper breathing technique.

1115
01:07:30,632 --> 01:07:31,461
Any questions?

1116
01:07:31,495 --> 01:07:32,358
- No, Cap.

1117
01:07:32,393 --> 01:07:33,187
- Are we ready?

1118
01:07:33,221 --> 01:07:34,119
- Yes, Cap.

1119
01:07:34,153 --> 01:07:35,120
- It's just a hike.

1120
01:07:36,569 --> 01:07:38,468
Okay. It's just a hike.

1121
01:07:38,502 --> 01:07:39,710
- Ready Cap?
- Yep.

1122
01:07:39,745 --> 01:07:40,953
- All right. Moving.

1123
01:07:40,987 --> 01:07:42,368
- Moving.

1124
01:07:42,403 --> 01:07:43,197
- Moving.

1125
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:44,267
- Moving.

1126
01:07:44,543 --> 01:07:46,510
- Tool left-hand, downhill side.
- Tool left-hand, downhill side.

1127
01:07:51,412 --> 01:07:52,861
- Keep that spacing again.

1128
01:08:05,909 --> 01:08:06,703
Don't stop.

1129
01:08:06,737 --> 01:08:07,566
Smaller steps.

1130
01:08:11,328 --> 01:08:12,122
- Don't stop.

1131
01:08:13,399 --> 01:08:14,952
- Come on. Don't stop.
Pushing, you can do it.

1132
01:08:14,987 --> 01:08:17,127
- Well, at first I
think about the pain.

1133
01:08:17,162 --> 01:08:18,680
I'll be like oh damn,
like this hurts.

1134
01:08:18,715 --> 01:08:20,544
Then again like,
oh I get that voice

1135
01:08:20,579 --> 01:08:22,581
in the back of my head.

1136
01:08:22,615 --> 01:08:23,513
Pains temporary.

1137
01:08:23,547 --> 01:08:25,687
You keep going, just keep going.

1138
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:30,244
My mom always asked me.

1139
01:08:31,693 --> 01:08:34,110
Don't you know how like,
how bad you impacted them?

1140
01:08:35,525 --> 01:08:37,182
She just tries to
get in my head.

1141
01:08:40,185 --> 01:08:42,704
Well, I brought a lot of
pain to different people.

1142
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,880
They lost their money.

1143
01:08:45,914 --> 01:08:47,364
They lost their car.

1144
01:08:47,399 --> 01:08:49,780
They couldn't get to their
job, to get their money.

1145
01:08:49,815 --> 01:08:51,437
I was like, what if
that like happened to me

1146
01:08:51,472 --> 01:08:52,576
and one of my family members.

1147
01:08:52,611 --> 01:08:54,199
Would I like that?

1148
01:08:54,233 --> 01:08:55,545
No, I wouldn't like that.

1149
01:08:57,236 --> 01:08:59,065
That's when I
started realizing, oh

1150
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:02,103
this is not what I
want to do in my life.

1151
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:03,794
- Hey! Steady pace.

1152
01:09:03,829 --> 01:09:04,830
Steady pace.

1153
01:09:07,212 --> 01:09:09,766
In your nose, out your
mouth. Stay upright.

1154
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:10,767
Just keep stepping.

1155
01:09:12,424 --> 01:09:13,425
- Bumping by.

1156
01:09:13,459 --> 01:09:16,807
- Remember to keep that
upper body straight.

1157
01:09:20,466 --> 01:09:21,467
- I can't go right now.

1158
01:09:22,779 --> 01:09:23,573
- Don't give up.

1159
01:09:33,859 --> 01:09:35,826
- We're almost finished!

1160
01:09:35,861 --> 01:09:37,552
Don't give up!

1161
01:09:37,587 --> 01:09:39,244
- Push
it out. Attaboy.

1162
01:09:40,245 --> 01:09:41,107
Push it out.

1163
01:09:42,350 --> 01:09:43,179
Solid finish.

1164
01:09:44,110 --> 01:09:45,008
Solid finish.

1165
01:09:56,053 --> 01:09:56,882
Hurry up!

1166
01:10:01,266 --> 01:10:03,199
Burn it out guys!

1167
01:10:20,906 --> 01:10:22,321
- Have a seat for a few minutes.

1168
01:10:22,356 --> 01:10:23,219
Get cooled off.

1169
01:10:28,569 --> 01:10:29,501
-- - 17.

1170
01:10:29,535 --> 01:10:30,467
- Good job boys.

1171
01:10:32,849 --> 01:10:35,990
-- - 38.

1172
01:10:36,024 --> 01:10:39,027
-- - 29.

1173
01:10:39,062 --> 01:10:41,823
- And- - 37.

1174
01:10:41,858 --> 01:10:43,308
- Hey!

1175
01:10:44,757 --> 01:10:46,414
- Winner, winner,
chicken dinner.

1176
01:10:50,315 --> 01:10:52,006
- I'm putting it on.

1177
01:10:53,870 --> 01:10:55,078
- It's all right.

1178
01:10:55,112 --> 01:10:56,286
You're going to be
all right, all right.

1179
01:10:56,321 --> 01:10:57,287
It's okay that
you're going here.

1180
01:10:57,322 --> 01:10:58,840
It's going to be all right.

1181
01:10:58,875 --> 01:11:00,290
- Mr. Bailon.

1182
01:11:00,325 --> 01:11:02,258
Congratulations on
passing training crew.

1183
01:11:02,292 --> 01:11:03,466
You're going to
be on crew three.

1184
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:04,812
Your green shirts and your hat.

1185
01:11:04,846 --> 01:11:06,814
And then I also need you
guys orange shirts back.

1186
01:11:06,848 --> 01:11:08,264
Okay?

1187
01:11:08,298 --> 01:11:10,058
So everyone turn your
orange shirts into me.
Put a green shirt on.

1188
01:11:10,093 --> 01:11:11,232
You guys are officially on crew.

1189
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:12,060
- Whoo!

1190
01:11:39,709 --> 01:11:41,055
- What's up man!

1191
01:11:44,645 --> 01:11:45,439
What's up.

1192
01:11:47,372 --> 01:11:48,856
- He's coming in here.

1193
01:11:48,890 --> 01:11:50,029
Oh, here.

1194
01:11:50,064 --> 01:11:51,341
- Hey.
- What's up, Grandpa?

1195
01:11:51,376 --> 01:11:53,239
You big ol' sucker.

1196
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:55,207
- How you doing?

1197
01:11:55,241 --> 01:11:56,622
- Good, good. How are you doing?

1198
01:11:56,657 --> 01:11:58,624
- I'm good.
- How do you feel?

1199
01:11:58,659 --> 01:11:59,522
- It's unbelievable.

1200
01:11:59,556 --> 01:12:01,213
- I know.

1201
01:12:02,076 --> 01:12:03,077
- It feels good.

1202
01:12:03,111 --> 01:12:04,078
- That's good.

1203
01:12:04,112 --> 01:12:05,079
- How are you doing?

1204
01:12:05,113 --> 01:12:05,907
I'm good. I'm good.

1205
01:12:05,942 --> 01:12:07,253
You're going to make it.

1206
01:12:07,288 --> 01:12:09,532
- Hi, my button!
How are you doing?

1207
01:12:09,566 --> 01:12:10,567
- I'm doing good.

1208
01:12:10,602 --> 01:12:11,534
- That's good.

1209
01:12:11,568 --> 01:12:12,707
- This house is so small.

1210
01:12:13,846 --> 01:12:14,778
- You're so big.

1211
01:12:16,504 --> 01:12:18,644
- Oh my God.

1212
01:12:18,679 --> 01:12:19,783
- Man, you got big.

1213
01:12:21,406 --> 01:12:23,097
- He's taller
than you grandpa.

1214
01:12:23,131 --> 01:12:23,994
- Yeah, he is.

1215
01:12:24,029 --> 01:12:24,857
Huh?

1216
01:12:26,031 --> 01:12:28,551
- Yeah. He's born
bigger than grandpa.

1217
01:12:28,585 --> 01:12:30,104
That's all.

1218
01:12:30,138 --> 01:12:31,450
Look at you.

1219
01:12:31,485 --> 01:12:32,486
He's grown up.

1220
01:12:33,418 --> 01:12:34,867
- So how you feel?

1221
01:12:41,115 --> 01:12:42,288
- Just happy to be home.

1222
01:12:48,709 --> 01:12:49,537
- Here.

1223
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,752
You'll be all right.

1224
01:12:57,787 --> 01:12:58,857
- I got plans.

1225
01:12:59,858 --> 01:13:00,859
I got plans.

1226
01:13:00,893 --> 01:13:02,826
I plan on being fire captain.

1227
01:13:02,861 --> 01:13:04,449
That's my goal right there.

1228
01:13:05,622 --> 01:13:07,866
I want to go back and
go back to the camp

1229
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:09,177
as a fire captain

1230
01:13:09,212 --> 01:13:11,525
and really help out
as much as possible.

1231
01:13:11,559 --> 01:13:12,698
- That's good.

1232
01:13:17,979 --> 01:13:19,118
- All right, go get the
lawnmower.

1233
01:13:19,153 --> 01:13:20,465
Let's go.

1234
01:13:20,499 --> 01:13:22,259
Well maybe we'll
do some yard work.

1235
01:13:29,094 --> 01:13:31,130
- Let's line it up. Let's go.

1236
01:13:31,165 --> 01:13:31,959
Line 'em up.

1237
01:13:31,993 --> 01:13:32,994
Let's go.

1238
01:13:33,029 --> 01:13:33,823
- All right now.

1239
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:41,278
Ok. 3 and 4. Fire roll!

1240
01:13:42,003 --> 01:13:42,797
- Line up.

1241
01:13:42,832 --> 01:13:43,729
Come on now.

1242
01:13:43,764 --> 01:13:44,661
Get your gear. Ready to go.

1243
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:49,873
- Let's go, baby!

1244
01:13:59,918 --> 01:14:00,919
- Fire roll.

1245
01:14:09,514 --> 01:14:11,170
- Another day.

1246
01:14:25,046 --> 01:14:27,359
- Baby I
just don't get it.

1247
01:14:27,393 --> 01:14:29,534
Do you enjoy, being hurt.

1248
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:33,123
I know you smell the perfume.

1249
01:14:33,158 --> 01:14:34,642
The makeup on his shirt.

1250
01:14:35,747 --> 01:14:38,094
But you don't
believe in stories.

1251
01:14:38,128 --> 01:14:40,372
And know that they're all lies.

1252
01:14:40,406 --> 01:14:43,548
As bad as you are,
to stick around.

1253
01:14:43,582 --> 01:14:45,515
And that's why I don't know why

1254
01:14:45,550 --> 01:14:47,862
If I was your man, baby you

1255
01:14:47,897 --> 01:14:50,865
I'll be by your
side, what he'd do

1256
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:53,419
I'll be running
home back to you.

1257
01:14:53,454 --> 01:14:55,905
Every night, doing you right.

1258
01:17:42,105 --> 01:17:44,763
- I can ensure
my possibility of

1259
01:17:44,798 --> 01:17:46,247
getting out next year

1260
01:17:46,282 --> 01:17:48,042
if I just keep doing what
I gotta do to get out.

1261
01:17:48,077 --> 01:17:50,700
Run my program
and work every day.

1262
01:17:50,735 --> 01:17:51,736
Fight fires.

1263
01:18:13,516 --> 01:18:15,069
It made me feel good.

1264
01:18:15,104 --> 01:18:17,520
I mean, it made me feel like

1265
01:18:18,935 --> 01:18:20,592
not necessarily that
I saved somebody.

1266
01:18:20,626 --> 01:18:25,286
But that I helped a person out.

1267
01:19:11,332 --> 01:19:13,127
- You can ask everybody I know.

1268
01:19:13,162 --> 01:19:14,128
What do I love?

1269
01:19:14,163 --> 01:19:15,751
Chainsaws and fire.

1270
01:19:15,785 --> 01:19:16,890
That's it.

1271
01:19:16,924 --> 01:19:18,719
Like dude, I will
never grow out of that.

1272
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:21,239
I think I will never
grow out of it.

1273
01:19:21,273 --> 01:19:22,999
I'm a firefighter at heart.

1274
01:19:34,873 --> 01:19:37,324
The way I see it, the fire helps

1275
01:19:37,358 --> 01:19:38,601
all the bad go away.

1276
01:19:39,844 --> 01:19:41,121
So the new can regrow.

1277
01:19:45,228 --> 01:19:48,438
It's a bad thing,
but it's beautiful.

1278
01:20:30,446 --> 01:20:31,827
- Movin'!
- Movin'!

1279
01:20:31,861 --> 01:20:32,793
- Got it.
