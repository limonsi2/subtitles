00:00:16,146 --> 00:00:20,542
- I believe... I truthfully
believe that reality television
has saved television.

4
00:00:20,585 --> 00:00:25,764
I... You know, actors,
writers, producers,
directors, agents,

5
00:00:25,808 --> 00:00:27,984
we all aspire to the truth,
you know?

6
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,378
And what greater truth
is there than reality?

7
00:00:30,421 --> 00:00:32,119
Even when it's scripted.

8
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:36,732
[indistinct radio chatter]

00:01:12,811 --> 00:01:17,251
[TV]: You've gotta hand it
to Coach Ty Carhart
for breaking this team's long...

10
00:01:17,512 --> 00:01:19,253
...and turning this team
into a real...

11
00:01:19,295 --> 00:01:21,255
- Alright.
Well, that's all of it, Jaynie.

12
00:01:21,298 --> 00:01:24,127
- You better get home,
or your mom's gonna kill me.
And remember--

13
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,303
- I know, I know.
Vance wasn't here.

14
00:01:26,347 --> 00:01:29,132
- Right.
- Thanks! Bye, Vance.
Great game tonight!

15
00:01:29,176 --> 00:01:32,744
- Bye, kidlet.
I'm gonna go up
and try tweaking the dish,

16
00:01:32,788 --> 00:01:34,658
see if we can get
some reception.

17
00:01:36,618 --> 00:01:40,926
Uh... babe, I know it's weird,
but are you sure you're okay?

18
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:42,711
I mean, with his release
and everything?

19
00:01:42,753 --> 00:01:44,800
- I'm okay.

20
00:01:44,843 --> 00:01:48,717
Some dads give interviews
to Fox Sports,
and some to parole boards.

21
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:50,719
[chuckling]
Mm...

22
00:01:53,722 --> 00:01:56,158
- You know,
when this show hits the air,

23
00:01:56,203 --> 00:01:58,553
you're gonna be the next
Blanca Champion, baby.

24
00:01:58,596 --> 00:02:00,337
[scoffing]
- Vance.

25
00:02:00,381 --> 00:02:04,863
She's skanky and blonde
and rich.
We have nothing in common.

26
00:02:04,907 --> 00:02:08,519
- Whoa, not true.
You both have smokin' hot
little booties.

27
00:02:09,477 --> 00:02:11,435
- Come on.
We have to close up.

28
00:02:11,478 --> 00:02:13,568
Then I can focus
all my attention on you.

29
00:02:15,265 --> 00:02:17,659
Go fix the dish
while I turn off the lights
on the trails.

30
00:02:17,702 --> 00:02:21,097
- Okay, roger that.
I can get the lights, too.
Just finish up in here. Really.

31
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,231
- I'll do it. I'll do it.
Don't take too long.

32
00:02:25,101 --> 00:02:26,972
- Hurry, please.
[laughing]

33
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:04,575
- Couldn't wait, huh?

34
00:03:08,405 --> 00:03:10,233
Very funny, Vance.

35
00:03:10,277 --> 00:03:12,235
Come on,
you know I hate this shit.

36
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:13,932
Vance?

37
00:03:20,635 --> 00:03:22,289

This is Margo Moorehead,
reporting live outside
the Culver City Courthouse,

59
00:05:30,852 --> 00:05:33,768
where it looks
like even more bad news
for Blanca Champion.

60
00:05:33,811 --> 00:05:37,075
On the heels
of her well-publicized bout
with exhaustion

61
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:40,252
come allegations of assault
and battery from John Jordan,

62
00:05:40,296 --> 00:05:43,560
a production assistant
on the set of her new movie,
Hush, Hush.

63
00:05:43,604 --> 00:05:48,391
As expected,
Jordan filed suit today against
Champion and Affiliated Studios.

64
00:05:48,435 --> 00:05:52,395
Allegedly, Champion found
a green-tea latte
not to her liking.

65
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:57,400
That's when sources say
Champion proceeded to hurl the
scalding-hot drink at Jordan,

66
00:05:57,444 --> 00:05:59,924
causing second-degree burns
from his torso,

67
00:05:59,968 --> 00:06:02,840
well, down to his more delicate
regions.

68
00:06:02,884 --> 00:06:04,668
In a statement
released this morning,

69
00:06:04,712 --> 00:06:07,105
Champion swears the beverage
was only lukewarm,

70
00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:10,500
which is, indeed,
why she threw it at him
in the first place.

71
00:06:10,544 --> 00:06:12,676
This is Margo Moorehead,
reporting...

72
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,375
- Hey.
- Where exactly did you burn?
Show us again.

73
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:19,509
- I, uh...
I was starting to think
that I'd never work again.

74
00:06:19,553 --> 00:06:22,991
- Oh, stop it, stop it.
Come on. Ahem.

75
00:06:23,034 --> 00:06:25,472
- Alright, I'm excited.
Tell me about this job.
- I'm serious, okay?

76
00:06:25,515 --> 00:06:28,649
It's a great concept
for a reality show.
Now, picture this:

77
00:06:28,692 --> 00:06:31,434
a small border town,
the high-school hockey team

78
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:34,784
on a 100-year losing streak
winds up with a star forward.

79
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:36,831
For the first time
in the school's history,

80
00:06:36,874 --> 00:06:39,921
they got a shot
at the State Championship.
Production's running behind.

81
00:06:39,964 --> 00:06:42,532
They need a solid director,
and I told them you're the guy.

82
00:06:42,576 --> 00:06:45,970
- Underdog sports team,
kid makes good. I like it.

83
00:06:46,014 --> 00:06:47,842
- I knew it. I knew it.
Now get this.

84
00:06:47,885 --> 00:06:49,800
The team's called
The Gold Diggers.

85
00:06:49,844 --> 00:06:52,890
They're from this tiny,
little town called White Plains
in North Dakota--

86
00:06:52,933 --> 00:06:55,632
- North Dakota? Oh, wow.

87
00:06:55,676 --> 00:06:59,506
Uh... border town
kinda makes it sound
like... Mexico.

88
00:06:59,549 --> 00:07:01,551
Uh... I don't know, Seaton.

89
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:03,597
I'm from San Diego.
I think I might freeze
my ass off.

90
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,729
- I know. I get it, okay?
Now get over it.

91
00:07:05,773 --> 00:07:09,429
And besides, the network
would really consider this one
a favour.

92
00:07:09,472 --> 00:07:12,083
And, actually,
there's one more thing.
- What?

93
00:07:13,607 --> 00:07:15,826
- Blanca Champion's gonna be
up there with you.

94
00:07:16,914 --> 00:07:20,091
- Blanca Champion?
- Her next movie's with
the network's film division,

95
00:07:20,135 --> 00:07:22,267
and she's playing
a reality-television director

96
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:24,182
who uncovers
some major political scandal.

97
00:07:24,226 --> 00:07:26,576
Haven't read the script yet.
She wants to do
the whole method thing,

98
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,448
you know, be taken seriously
as an actress.

99
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:30,624
And since you and Blanca
work so well together,

100
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:32,843
the network thought
that she could observe you.

101
00:07:32,887 --> 00:07:34,541
- Work well together?
Seaton, I...

102
00:07:34,584 --> 00:07:36,891
I was her production assistant
on her first movie.

103
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:39,328
I was a glorified babysitter.
I doubt she even remembers me.

104
00:07:39,371 --> 00:07:42,505
- Well, guess what.
Not only does she remember you,
she loves, loves the idea.

105
00:07:42,549 --> 00:07:44,507
She says this time around,
she could be your PA.

106
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:47,510
Besides,
with all the bad publicity
she's been getting lately,

107
00:07:47,554 --> 00:07:49,643
she could use
a little babysitting.

108
00:07:50,818 --> 00:07:52,733
- Seaton,
let me get this straight.

109
00:07:52,776 --> 00:07:57,215
You want me to go
to a remote town in a red state
that borders Canada

110
00:07:57,259 --> 00:08:01,655
with Blanca Champion pretending
to fetch people coffee? What?

111
00:08:01,698 --> 00:08:03,657
Seaton, that's ridiculous.
I... I'm not that broke.

112
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,877
And to be honest with you,
life is too short.
And how's it even possible?

113
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:09,837
You know what it's like
going out in public with her.
Draws crowds like The Beatles.

114
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,056
- No, no, no,
that's the beauty, Jake.

115
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,406
The townspeople
have already signed
non-disclosure agreements.

116
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:18,410
You and Blanca are gonna be
in the middle of nowhere.
Only studio publicity knows.

117
00:08:18,454 --> 00:08:21,239
And by the time the World Press
gets wind of it,
your show will be wrapped.

118
00:08:21,283 --> 00:08:24,112
And best of all,
they're gonna pay your rate.
Yeah-ha. Yeah, you're welcome.

119
00:08:24,155 --> 00:08:25,809
[scoffing]

120
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:28,551
- Can I bring my dog?

121
00:08:28,595 --> 00:08:33,556
- My name is Nik and I am a PA
on the show Digger Fever.

122
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,341
White Plains is the kind of city
that...

123
00:08:36,385 --> 00:08:38,779
people in Middle America
make fun of.

124
00:08:38,822 --> 00:08:40,432
[whimpering]

125
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:44,219
- There you go, buddy.
How you doing, buddy?

126
00:08:44,261 --> 00:08:46,134
I missed you, yeah.
I missed you.

127
00:08:46,177 --> 00:08:49,572
- Hey, you must be Jake.
I'm Greg, the production's UPM.

128
00:08:49,616 --> 00:08:51,139
- Hey, man.
Nice to meet you.

129
00:08:51,182 --> 00:08:54,751
- It's about a six-hour drive
to White Plains from here.

130
00:08:54,795 --> 00:08:57,145
- I was surprised
there was no other crew
on the plane.

131
00:08:57,188 --> 00:09:00,061
- Well, most of the crew arrived
the Monday before last.

132
00:09:00,104 --> 00:09:03,020
It's been pretty intense here
with all that's happened.

133
00:09:03,064 --> 00:09:06,284
- Why? What's happened?
- One of the local girls
just got killed.

134
00:09:06,328 --> 00:09:08,286
ATV accident.

135
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:11,725
Town folk pretty much
freaked out when Ted,
our first director,

136
00:09:11,768 --> 00:09:13,944
tried to get exclusive
with them about it.

137
00:09:13,988 --> 00:09:18,558
- Wait.
Ted... your first director?
So I'm... I'm replacing him?

138
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:22,474
- Dude, those agent types
aren't too big
on full disclosure, are they?

139
00:09:24,607 --> 00:09:27,567
[radio]:
We're taking a poll this morning
on Good Morning White Plains.

140
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,960
Bob Hansen, you're...
[honking]

141
00:09:42,103 --> 00:09:44,671
- Jake, this intersection's
a good landmark.

142
00:09:44,714 --> 00:09:47,804
It's exactly 39 miles
from your cabin.

143
00:09:47,848 --> 00:09:50,894
The mini-market on the right
is where we do
most of our shopping.

144
00:09:56,117 --> 00:09:58,510
- Is this the place?
- Yeah, almost.

145
00:09:58,554 --> 00:10:01,296
It's about another mile
and a half down this road.

146
00:10:13,351 --> 00:10:16,311
The second door on your right's
the bedroom.

147
00:10:16,354 --> 00:10:19,140
You're sharing this place
with Lee,
our executive producer.

148
00:10:25,363 --> 00:10:28,149
Oh, by the way,
Lee wants to meet you in an hour
at the local diner

149
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:29,890
for a production meeting.

150
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:34,808
- Uh, okay. Um...
so it's just me and Lee here?

151
00:10:34,851 --> 00:10:36,810
Is... is he here right now?

152
00:10:36,853 --> 00:10:38,812
Yeah, uh, she, and no.

153
00:10:38,855 --> 00:10:41,336
She's actually sleeping
at one of the other crew cabins,

154
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:43,381
but we're not supposed
to know about that.

155
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:46,558
Got map and directions...
and keys.

156
00:10:47,168 --> 00:10:49,431
Peace out, brother.

157
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:58,005
- Bongo...
what did I just get us into?

158
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,704
- I generally tell my clients
what they need to know.

159
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:05,839
And... and Jake needed a job,
and, um... and he got it.

160
00:11:13,803 --> 00:11:16,632
- I can't hear...
You're gonna have to speak up.

161
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,329
I can't hear you.

162
00:11:24,466 --> 00:11:26,903
Hello? Sit.

163
00:11:26,947 --> 00:11:28,949
Oh, piece of crap.

164
00:11:29,906 --> 00:11:32,169
- You must be Jake.
I'm Phoebe, Lee's assistant.

165
00:11:32,213 --> 00:11:33,867
We're totally excited
you're here.

166
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,086
- Jake, I'm Lee Tyson,
the show's producer.

167
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,132
Thank you for getting here
so quick.

168
00:11:38,175 --> 00:11:41,178
Hey, Phoebe, do me a favour.
Will you go call
the equipment house,

169
00:11:41,222 --> 00:11:42,919
see where the rest
of our stuff is?

170
00:11:42,963 --> 00:11:45,748
- Sure. I'll be right back.

171
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,317
- Okay, look, here's the deal:

172
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,449
these people think we are here
to shoot a reality show

173
00:11:51,493 --> 00:11:53,538
about their loser hockey team
making good.

174
00:11:53,582 --> 00:11:56,367
But some girl kills herself
joy riding at night,

175
00:11:56,411 --> 00:11:58,587
probably drunk on moonshine
or something.

176
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,111
Everyone's all bent out of shape
about this except Coach Carhart,

177
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:03,418
who only cares about winning
the championship.

178
00:12:03,461 --> 00:12:06,464
Now, did I mention the ex-coach,
Hansen?

179
00:12:06,508 --> 00:12:08,771
He's a flippin' loon
who just got out prison

180
00:12:08,815 --> 00:12:11,208
for "accidentally" killing
his wife 10 years ago.

181
00:12:11,252 --> 00:12:13,820
Carhart's son was banging
Hansen's daughter.

182
00:12:13,863 --> 00:12:15,778
Hansen's daughter...

183
00:12:15,822 --> 00:12:18,433
ends up dead.
It's fucking gold.

184
00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:21,958
- Wow. Yeah, um...

185
00:12:22,002 --> 00:12:24,004
that's... that's a lot
of information.

186
00:12:25,092 --> 00:12:30,837
Uh... you know, Lee, I...
I kind of liked the whole
underdog-hockey-team angle.

187
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,102
Uh, not really such a fan
of messing with people's heads.

188
00:12:36,886 --> 00:12:39,628
- And I am telling you
that I want you to go
to that high school

189
00:12:39,671 --> 00:12:44,546
and shoot me a fuckin' show
about these crazy coaches
and their beer-guzzling buddies.

190
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:46,243
Got it?

191
00:12:48,289 --> 00:12:51,161
- Seaton Brookstone's office.
- Hello? Hey, Shannon.

192
00:12:51,205 --> 00:12:52,859
Hey, it's Jake. Is Seaton in?

193
00:12:52,902 --> 00:12:55,644
- Hi, Jake.
Having a bad time hearing you.

194
00:12:55,687 --> 00:12:59,169
Not a good connection.
I don't have Seaton right now.
He's in a meeting.

195
00:12:59,213 --> 00:13:01,389
- Yeah, I'm sure he is.
Listen, Shannon, I...

196
00:13:01,432 --> 00:13:04,958
This is the first time
I've had any bars on my phone
since I landed.

197
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:07,612
Something...
something's off here,
and I really need to talk to him

198
00:13:07,656 --> 00:13:10,528
before I go in
and start this thing up.
Have him call me, please?

199
00:13:12,443 --> 00:13:13,880
Hello?

200
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,186

204
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,172
- I'm Keir,
your camera assistant.

205
00:13:45,607 --> 00:13:47,304
Or at least I think so.

206
00:13:47,348 --> 00:13:50,307
'Cause no one spends
that much money on sunglasses
around here.

207
00:13:51,265 --> 00:13:54,616
So I figure you're Jake, right?
- Uh... I... I am.

208
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:58,011
Um... and I got these for free
off my last show.

209
00:13:58,054 --> 00:14:01,144
I was, um... I was worried
they were a bit too fancy
for me.

210
00:14:01,188 --> 00:14:02,885
- No, you pull them off well.

211
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:06,280
- Can I talk you into maybe...
showing me around this place?

212
00:14:06,323 --> 00:14:08,456
- So did you meet Lee?

213
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:10,980
- Oh, yeah.
[laughter]

214
00:14:11,024 --> 00:14:14,636
- Yeah, she's quite a lady.
And I use the term loosely.

215
00:14:15,724 --> 00:14:18,118
Look, before we go in, uh...

216
00:14:18,161 --> 00:14:21,469
I don't mean to cross any lines,
but can I show you something?

217
00:14:21,512 --> 00:14:23,427
- Yeah, sure.

218
00:14:24,994 --> 00:14:26,778
[bell ringing]

219
00:14:28,955 --> 00:14:31,392
- I'm dying to Google
these people.

220
00:14:31,435 --> 00:14:33,046
I don't know
if you've tried yet,

221
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:35,483
but it's impossible to get
on the internet up here.

222
00:14:35,526 --> 00:14:37,746
I've tried the dial-up,
like, 30 times,

223
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:40,096
only to get knocked off
after 10 seconds.

224
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,837
- This is the girl that died.

225
00:14:43,099 --> 00:14:44,927
Jaynie, right?
- Yeah.

226
00:14:44,971 --> 00:14:47,495
This girl's death was just...

227
00:14:47,538 --> 00:14:49,192
so violent.

228
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:53,936
- So you started checking
into the town's history...
hoping to find what?

229
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,417
- I don't know,
but let's just say
for a town this small,

230
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,985
this place has had its share
of death and drama.

231
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:04,425
"Left behind are Ty Carhart
and his two-year-old, Vance,

232
00:15:04,468 --> 00:15:07,471
the surviving twin.
Father and son
were in Whiskey River,

233
00:15:07,515 --> 00:15:09,952
picking up supplies
when the accident happened."

234
00:15:11,127 --> 00:15:13,956
This is Carhart...
the hockey coach?

235
00:15:14,565 --> 00:15:17,742
- Yep.
- I mean, this is...
an awful story, all of it.

236
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:22,008
But... I don't really get
what it has to do
with this ATV accident.

237
00:15:23,357 --> 00:15:26,186
- You two have to leave. Now!

238
00:15:26,795 --> 00:15:30,668
- Jaynie Hansen's death, um,
you know, where...
where I'm from,

239
00:15:30,712 --> 00:15:33,715
you get a cut, a scrape,
a broken leg,
is considered an accident.

240
00:15:33,758 --> 00:15:37,240
What happened to her...
I don't think
that was an accident.

241
00:15:40,461 --> 00:15:42,289

- We're not gonna beat
Eagle Ridge unless you show
some hustle, boy!

247
00:15:55,171 --> 00:15:58,392
Maybe we ought to take
this practice outside,
run a few laps.

248
00:15:58,435 --> 00:16:00,785
Then you'll play like men
instead of wussies.

249

- I didn't know
you were on this show, man.

253
00:16:13,102 --> 00:16:15,931
- Thank God you're here, dude.
These people are a bunch
of freaks!

254
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,065
- We did a show called Your Town
over in Miami a few years ago.
- Yeah.

255
00:16:19,108 --> 00:16:21,981
- How's the rest of the crew?
- Let me put it to you this way.

256

Our sound guy's a local hire
who lives in his car.

257
00:16:24,418 --> 00:16:26,115
- We should get going
'cause Lee's gonna get here,

258
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:28,117
and that woman,
we do not want to piss off.

259
00:16:28,161 --> 00:16:30,859
- Alright, man.
[both]: Good to see you. Yeah.
- See you in a bit.

00:16:40,651 --> 00:16:42,218
- What the...?

00:16:42,262 --> 00:16:43,872
- Here he is!

262
00:16:43,915 --> 00:16:46,048
- How you doin', man? Alright.

263
00:16:46,092 --> 00:16:49,051
- Jake, looks like
you already met Keir.

264
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:52,315
This is Daphne,
our story producer.

265
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:54,317
And this is Mike,
your sound guy.

266
00:16:54,361 --> 00:16:57,494
- Hey, man, have we worked
together before?

267
00:16:57,538 --> 00:17:00,019
- What?
- Hi, Jake.

268
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:03,239
- Hi.
- I know it's trèsgeeky to say,
but I love your work.

269
00:17:03,283 --> 00:17:05,111
I'm so excited
you're on this project.

270
00:17:05,154 --> 00:17:08,853
Back on the Ranch
is my favourite show. Was.

271
00:17:08,896 --> 00:17:11,595
- Uh, well, thank you.
I'm glad you liked it.
I did, too.

272
00:17:11,638 --> 00:17:13,597
- Alright, the only one missing
is Nik, our PA.

273
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:15,295
But he went to Winnipeg
to pick up Blanca.

274
00:17:15,338 --> 00:17:18,079
- She's arriving by helicopter.
Isn't that cool?

275
00:17:18,124 --> 00:17:21,040
- Yeah, it's very cool.
- I was the first one here,

276
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:25,521
so if you want the backstory
on anyone, cast or crew,
come to me.

277
00:17:25,566 --> 00:17:27,872
- Hi, Daphne!
Is she here yet?

278
00:17:27,915 --> 00:17:30,136
- Almost! That's Erin,
the head cheerleader.

279
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:32,138
She's very excited
to meet Blanca.

280
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:35,924

to White Plains
to do research for a movie role.

281
00:17:35,967 --> 00:17:39,623
She's playing a reality-TV
director who uncovers
some big political scandal.

- I can't even begin
to believe this.

283
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,833
- Oh, I...
I'll be right back. Okay.

284
00:18:18,749 --> 00:18:20,403
- Hi, Blanca.

286
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,540
- Hi.

287
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,455
what the hell are you wearing?

288
00:18:28,498 --> 00:18:30,892
- I was told to dress sexy.
- By who? Seaton?

289
00:18:30,935 --> 00:18:34,635
- It's being handled,
right, sweetheart?
- Handled!

290
00:18:34,678 --> 00:18:38,204
- Ms. Champion,
I am so excited to meet you.

291
00:18:38,247 --> 00:18:40,162
I... I...
I am your biggest fan.

292
00:18:40,206 --> 00:18:43,818
You are a personal hero to me.
Do you think you can sign this,
please?

293
00:18:44,384 --> 00:18:47,169
- Sure, sweetie.
- Um...

294
00:18:47,213 --> 00:18:50,216
I know it's none of my business,
but you two were so close.

295
00:18:50,259 --> 00:18:52,087
Why were you fighting?

296
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,698
- Because she's a cunt.
- Okay.

297
00:18:54,742 --> 00:18:57,005
Uh, excuse us for a second.
We're just gonna...

298
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:01,096
- Um, I'm a big fan, too.

299
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,576
- Yeah?

300
00:19:03,446 --> 00:19:05,187
- We'll have a little talk,
shall we?

301
00:19:05,231 --> 00:19:07,798
- Okay. Easy, Scooby.
You're turning me on.

302
00:19:07,842 --> 00:19:10,192
- Please don't call me Scooby.

303
00:19:10,236 --> 00:19:12,368
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

304
00:19:13,543 --> 00:19:16,633
Hey, buddy, um,
do you mind excusing us
for a second?

305
00:19:17,286 --> 00:19:21,508
- Hey, sexy.
I like where those shorts
cup your little ass.

306
00:19:22,683 --> 00:19:24,859
It's delicious.

307
00:19:24,902 --> 00:19:26,556
[giggling]

308
00:19:27,557 --> 00:19:30,560
- Blanca...
do you even remember me?

309
00:19:30,604 --> 00:19:34,260
- I'm sorry.
Are we in the boys' locker room?
It stinks in here. Blech!

310
00:19:34,303 --> 00:19:37,654
- Yeah. No, I know this isn't,
uh, exactly ideal,

311
00:19:37,698 --> 00:19:40,657
but I hear if we make it
through the next few weeks
on our best behaviour,

312
00:19:40,701 --> 00:19:42,920
we're gonna score big bonus
points with the studio.

313
00:19:42,964 --> 00:19:46,315
- Ooh, what's best behaviour?
- Well, it's probably, uh,

314
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:48,883
not using the "C" word in front
of the small-town cheerleaders.

315
00:19:48,926 --> 00:19:51,625
- Oh, God.
They're dealing with some
heavy shit around here.

316
00:19:51,668 --> 00:19:55,585
A local girl recently got killed
in an accident, so the people
are pretty shook up.

317
00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:57,283
- Alright, whatever.

318
00:19:59,502 --> 00:20:02,113
Okay, you know what?
I get it.

319
00:20:02,157 --> 00:20:06,292
And I'm serious
about this movie research stuff,
okay?

320
00:20:06,335 --> 00:20:08,250
I'm sick of playing
dopey teenagers.

321
00:20:08,294 --> 00:20:10,600
I have to nail this.
We're cool.

322
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:13,037
- Alright. Oh, hey, and uh,

323
00:20:13,081 --> 00:20:17,390
it's kinda cold in here,
so you may want to rethink
the whole mini-skirt thing.

324
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:19,522
- Fuck off.
- Okay. Nice. Very nice.

325
00:20:19,566 --> 00:20:22,743
- Blanca Champion. Wow!
- I'd say we have
a pretty unique connection.

326
00:20:22,786 --> 00:20:26,921
I mean, how many guys can say
that they've carried
all 28 pieces of her luggage?

327
00:20:26,964 --> 00:20:32,056
- She's, uh...
she's very, uh...
I... How to say this?

328
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,538
- I held her hand. Well, I...
I blocked her hand.

329
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:40,021
Yeah, she was trying to hit me.
It was my fault.
I made a mistake.

330
00:20:40,064 --> 00:20:41,849
But, yeah, I mean,
we're pretty close.

331
00:20:41,892 --> 00:20:43,938
[music playing]
[crowd cheering]

332
00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:49,378
[indistinct announcer chatter]

333
00:20:53,991 --> 00:20:56,690
- ...Vance Carhart scores again!

334
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:58,474
By the way,
ladies and gentlemen,

335
00:20:58,518 --> 00:21:00,781
don't forget
to look for yourself
on television this fall

336
00:21:00,824 --> 00:21:05,002
as the Diggers star
in Digger Fever,
their very own reality show.

337
00:21:05,046 --> 00:21:07,614
- Yeah! Oh!
[indistinct announcer chatter]

338
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:09,877
- We are just so blessed
by Jesus Christ,

339
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,706
and I know that he really wants
us to win State.

340
00:21:12,749 --> 00:21:15,099
- I'm sorry, but I gotta ask.
What can you tell me

341
00:21:15,143 --> 00:21:18,320
about your friend Jaynie's death
or her father's release
from prison?

342
00:21:18,364 --> 00:21:20,540
- Um...

343
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:23,064
I don't think I'm supposed
to talk about that.

344
00:21:23,934 --> 00:21:26,197
- Erin, let's wrap this up.

345
00:21:27,503 --> 00:21:29,200
- I have to go now.

346
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:35,903
- You know... I don't even want
to tell you what I saw
down in that boiler room.

347
00:21:35,946 --> 00:21:38,732
- The townspeople are all
up in my grill because...

348
00:21:38,775 --> 00:21:42,301
I've got my crew asking
questions that aren't
just about hockey.

349
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:45,129
Give me a break.
Do these people don't even own
a fucking television?

350
00:21:45,173 --> 00:21:47,784
It's not like the show's
for the fucking Nature Channel,
people.

351
00:22:29,652 --> 00:22:31,785
[screaming]

352
00:22:34,178 --> 00:22:36,398
[screaming]

353
00:22:42,665 --> 00:22:44,580
[screaming]

354
00:23:00,204 --> 00:23:02,250
[up-tempo music]

355
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:07,298
- Where are we even going,
anyways?

356
00:23:07,342 --> 00:23:10,084
And I can't believe
this is the crew van.
So lame.

357
00:23:10,127 --> 00:23:12,521
- It's a low-budget show.
The school let us use this
for free.

358
00:23:12,565 --> 00:23:16,133
- Look, guys, if this is
what the kids are talking about,
this is the story to follow.

359
00:23:16,177 --> 00:23:18,440
Everyone we've talked to
has brought up this Hansen guy.

360
00:23:18,484 --> 00:23:21,835
- Does anyone know how long
this guy's been outta prison?
- Less than a month.

361
00:23:21,878 --> 00:23:26,666
- Do I need to remind you
that I'm on a 10-hour schedule
and I don't do overtime?

362
00:23:26,709 --> 00:23:28,232
- Okay.

363
00:23:28,276 --> 00:23:29,799
Thanks, Mike.

364
00:23:29,843 --> 00:23:32,236
- Whatever.
- Nik, any idea
where this cabin is?

365
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,457
- Erin said we can't miss it.
Should be just off the lake.

366
00:24:05,661 --> 00:24:07,228
- Hello?

367
00:24:13,843 --> 00:24:15,497
Coach Hansen?

368
00:24:34,168 --> 00:24:36,866
Hi. Uh, my name's Jake Tanner,

369
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:39,347
and, um, we're in town
shooting a show--

370
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:42,393
- "Wash me thoroughly
from my iniquity
and cleanse me from my sin.

371
00:24:42,437 --> 00:24:47,311
Against Thee have I only sinned
and done that which is evil
in Thy sight."

372
00:24:47,355 --> 00:24:49,444
- This is fucking scary as shit.

373
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,926
- I'm just gonna put
this microphone on you
right here, okay? Ah!

374
00:24:52,969 --> 00:24:56,886
- Get the hell outta here.
I didn't invite you here.
This is private property.

375
00:24:58,584 --> 00:25:00,934
I said get the hell out!

376
00:25:00,977 --> 00:25:03,327
- Okay, okay. Sorry.
- All of ya!

377
00:25:03,371 --> 00:25:07,070
- Didn't mean to bother you.
We don't want any trouble.
- I want my microphone.

378
00:25:07,114 --> 00:25:11,248
- Just leave it.
- I'm billing the production.
- Just leave it.

379
00:25:13,424 --> 00:25:16,427
- Man, I've done a lot of shows
where they picketed us.
Like Your Town Seattle,

380
00:25:16,471 --> 00:25:18,473
they didn't want us there.
But this? This place...

381
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,823
- You'd think
they don't even want an economy.

382
00:25:20,867 --> 00:25:25,175
I mean, they just wanna,
you know, sit around and,
you know... eat elk.

383
00:25:25,219 --> 00:25:26,873
- And the ex-coach,

384
00:25:26,916 --> 00:25:29,832
he looks like the villain
from the Scooby Doo cartoons.
Weird.

385
00:25:29,876 --> 00:25:33,357
- That reality-TV crew
should've been following me
around, you know?

386
00:25:33,401 --> 00:25:36,273
While they were out talking
to Jaynie Hansen's crazy dad,

387
00:25:36,317 --> 00:25:39,668
I was finding the cheerleading
coach's body all mangled
in the woodshop.

388
00:25:39,712 --> 00:25:42,584
Now that would've made
for some great television,
you know?

389
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:46,457
I took some footage
with my camera phone
if you guys wanna buy it.

390
00:25:46,501 --> 00:25:49,591
- Honestly, I'd like to know
where the fuck my crew was

391
00:25:49,635 --> 00:25:52,681
when that shloop was finding
a body in the woodshop.

392
00:25:52,725 --> 00:25:56,119
Probably asking some little kid
about the thrill of victory.

393
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:07,391
I don't give a fuck who she is.
Her agent... Wait a minute.

394
00:26:07,435 --> 00:26:09,393
That asshole is your agent, too,
isn't he? Yeah.

395
00:26:09,437 --> 00:26:12,135
He made me pay her as a PA
while she does her research.

396
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:14,355
So guess what that means.
She needs to work

397
00:26:14,398 --> 00:26:16,487
like a fucking PA,
so this is how it's gonna go.

398
00:26:16,531 --> 00:26:19,229
As long as she's on my payroll,
remember this.

399
00:26:19,273 --> 00:26:21,318
- Will do.
- I wanna know when she naps,

400
00:26:21,362 --> 00:26:23,407
where she naps
and how long she naps.

401
00:26:23,451 --> 00:26:26,019
You're gonna write it down,
deduct it from her paycheque.
Got it?

402
00:26:26,062 --> 00:26:28,543
[scoffing]
- Lee, why don't you give her
a break?

403
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,589
She travelled all night.
- That's just great.

404
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:33,853
What do you want to do?
Give her a fucking bottle
and change her diapers, too?

405
00:26:37,552 --> 00:26:40,424
- Mister?
- Hey. What's up, buddy?

406
00:26:40,468 --> 00:26:42,601
- It wasn't an accident.

407
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:45,342
- Okay, I'm listening.

408
00:26:45,386 --> 00:26:48,345
- Jaynie used to take me
cross-country skiing there
all the time.

409
00:26:48,389 --> 00:26:50,086
She knew that place.

410
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,003
I heard something
when I was leaving that night.

411
00:26:54,961 --> 00:26:56,919
But I didn't do nothin'.

412
00:26:56,963 --> 00:26:59,139
- Well, you know what I think?

413
00:26:59,182 --> 00:27:01,707
I think you're one
brave little guy
for telling me that.

414
00:27:03,491 --> 00:27:06,146
I'm gonna do some asking around.
Cool?

415
00:27:06,189 --> 00:27:07,843
- Cool.
- Come on.

416
00:27:11,281 --> 00:27:15,329
- You know, if... you know,
if you wanna nap,

417
00:27:15,372 --> 00:27:18,724
then, uh,
the bed in my camper is...

418
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:21,509
it's a lot more comfortable
than here.

419
00:27:21,552 --> 00:27:23,903
- I'm fine here, fuck face.
But thanks.

420
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,356
[wind whistling]

421
00:27:53,889 --> 00:27:55,848
- Lee?

422
00:27:55,891 --> 00:27:57,588
You home?

423
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:04,073
Ah... Hey, buddy.

424
00:28:04,117 --> 00:28:06,032
How you doing?
[whimpering]

425
00:28:06,075 --> 00:28:09,688
Yeah, you wanna go outside,
don't you? Alright.

426
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:12,168
Alright, come on.
Come on, Bongo.

427
00:28:14,649 --> 00:28:16,520
Oh, shit!

428
00:28:16,564 --> 00:28:18,827
Oh, Jesus Christ,
you scared the hell outta me.

429
00:28:18,871 --> 00:28:22,657
- Don't go digging up shit
you don't know nothing about.

430
00:28:23,832 --> 00:28:25,486
- I'm sorry, what?
- You heard me!

431
00:28:25,529 --> 00:28:27,749
It's a small town,
we all talk to each other.

432
00:28:27,793 --> 00:28:30,404
I don't care to hear
none of the shit
Coach Hansen is spinning.

433
00:28:30,447 --> 00:28:32,972
He's an ex-con...
and a murderer.

434
00:28:34,234 --> 00:28:36,236
Are we clear?

435
00:28:37,367 --> 00:28:39,848
- Yeah... we're clear.

436
00:28:44,418 --> 00:28:48,030
- I don't want to accuse
Vance's dad of having anything
to do with these killings,

437
00:28:48,074 --> 00:28:50,772
but... I have a weird inkling
that there....

438
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,556
there's some connection there.

439
00:28:58,824 --> 00:29:00,564
[sighing]

440
00:29:00,608 --> 00:29:02,958
- Jesus Christ.
[Bongo whimpering]

441
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:22,282
[whimpering]

442
00:29:35,991 --> 00:29:37,688
[moaning]

443
00:29:47,307 --> 00:29:49,962
Oh, wow. Uh, Jesus. Sorry.

444
00:29:50,005 --> 00:29:51,746
- Nice timing, douchebag.

445
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,793
- Um, we were just gonna go
get a beer or whatnot.

446
00:29:54,836 --> 00:29:56,925
You should totally come.

447
00:29:56,969 --> 00:29:58,840
- Okay.

448
00:30:03,845 --> 00:30:05,629
- You're so bad.
[laughter]

449
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,375
[pop music playing]

450
00:30:20,731 --> 00:30:23,909
- I'm fairly certain
that Blanca chick wants me.

451
00:30:25,736 --> 00:30:27,695
I have that extra sense,
you know.

452
00:30:27,738 --> 00:30:30,002
Like, I can smell blood
a mile away.

453
00:30:30,045 --> 00:30:32,526
I knew something was rotten
in Bismarck.

454
00:30:32,569 --> 00:30:35,877
Sheriff says she was in there
for hours before I found her.

455
00:30:35,921 --> 00:30:37,792
- Has anyone told her husband?

456
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,012
- Nah. He's downstate
on a timber run.

457
00:30:40,055 --> 00:30:42,144
I tried him on the C.B.,
but no luck.

458
00:30:42,188 --> 00:30:44,233
- Who are you guys
talking about?

459
00:30:44,277 --> 00:30:47,584
- There was... an accident
up at the school.

460
00:30:47,628 --> 00:30:50,326
Miss Falls,
the cheerleading coach.

461
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,677
- Decapitated.
Heartbeat-less.

462
00:30:53,721 --> 00:30:56,071
- I get it. It's awful.

463
00:30:56,115 --> 00:30:59,509
- Look, uh, what do you say
we cut outta here?

464
00:30:59,553 --> 00:31:01,816
Let's go for a midnight swim.

465
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,514
- I'd say, "Hell, yeah."
- I'll get our coats.

466
00:31:09,737 --> 00:31:12,522
- No good can come
of you staying here.

467
00:31:12,566 --> 00:31:15,090
Mark my words and leave now.

468
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,876
All of you.
- Hey!

469
00:31:18,572 --> 00:31:21,270
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Come on, man.

470
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:23,925
- Jesus.

471
00:31:25,709 --> 00:31:28,930
- Guess it's safe to say
they don't like us being here.
- No, I don't think they do.

472
00:31:28,974 --> 00:31:32,716
- No, no, no.
Don't any of you listen
to that crackpot. He's a drunk.

473
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,197
We just need to get our show
in the can and move on.

474
00:31:35,241 --> 00:31:37,721
Now, wrap it up.
We've got an early-morning call.

475
00:31:37,765 --> 00:31:42,335
- I guess now isn't a good time
to mention they found
Miss Falls's body at the school?

476
00:31:42,378 --> 00:31:43,989
There was another accident.

477
00:31:44,032 --> 00:31:45,860
- Get the hell outta here.

478
00:31:52,562 --> 00:31:54,347
- Crazy shit.

479
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:57,524
- What do I think
about the amount of accidents
in this town? Um...

480
00:31:57,567 --> 00:32:00,266
I think it's a shame it happened
to all the pretty people.
I'm just kidding.

481
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:02,442
That's not even funny.
It's inappropriate. Sorry.

482
00:32:43,004 --> 00:32:45,485
- Did you hear this?
Blanca Champion
has gotten herself into...

483
00:32:45,528 --> 00:32:48,879
- For the last time,
I don't know where
the damn camera stuff is.

484
00:32:48,923 --> 00:32:50,533
It never arrived.

485
00:32:50,577 --> 00:32:52,492
- Oh, will you just zip
your piehole?

486
00:32:52,535 --> 00:32:56,583
I can't call the network
and tell them $30,000 worth
of equipment is MIA!

487
00:32:56,626 --> 00:32:58,933
- It is not okay
to talk to me like that.

488
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:02,023
I did not sign on
for this totally deceptive job
and whatnot.

489
00:33:02,067 --> 00:33:04,417
And why can't you just give
the network the show
they ordered?

490
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,941
It's a totally better show.

491
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:12,468
- Because... no one wants
to watch a show
about some wittle hockey team.

492
00:33:13,034 --> 00:33:16,646
They'd much rather watch a show
about a bloodthirsty convict
out for revenge.

493
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,300
That is why.

494
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,434
- Can I ask you something?
- What?

495
00:33:21,477 --> 00:33:24,959
- Did you seduce me
because you thought
it would keep me quiet?

496
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,353
Because that was a total
miscalculation.

497
00:33:27,396 --> 00:33:30,356
- Well, I think
that you're gonna keep quiet.
You know why?

498
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:33,054
If you don't, I will cancel
your plane ticket home,

499
00:33:33,098 --> 00:33:36,057
I will drive you
out into the woods
and I will leave you there.

500
00:33:37,102 --> 00:33:38,886
- You wouldn't do that to me.

501
00:33:38,929 --> 00:33:42,237
- You can try me,
then we can continue
to play nice or not.

502
00:33:42,281 --> 00:33:44,022
The choice is yours, Phoebe.

503
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:46,198
You're a real cooze.

504
00:33:46,241 --> 00:33:48,113
And an awful boss.

505
00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:05,695
- As long as these guys
play Digger hockey
and keep focused on the game,

506
00:34:05,739 --> 00:34:07,958
there's not gonna
be any stopping 'em.

507
00:34:08,002 --> 00:34:10,873
Look, I only got two hours
till the next game.
I got things to do.

508
00:34:15,705 --> 00:34:17,620
Come on!

509
00:34:17,664 --> 00:34:21,536
- Hey, is the, uh...
is the coach mic'd?
I'm having trouble hearing him.

510
00:34:21,581 --> 00:34:25,367
- No, he's not mic'd.
We left his out at
the crazy guy's shack, remember?

511
00:34:25,411 --> 00:34:27,804
- We gotta have this guy
mic'd before the playoff games.

512
00:34:27,848 --> 00:34:30,242
- Then I suggest you send
somebody out there to get it.

513
00:34:30,284 --> 00:34:32,853
- Okay... I'm sending you.

514
00:34:33,984 --> 00:34:38,163
- Yeah, I can do that.
Except is there anybody else
here that can wire a PA system,

515
00:34:38,206 --> 00:34:41,340
that can run a play-by-play?
It'll take me about 1.5 hours,

516
00:34:41,382 --> 00:34:44,255
so it's a perfect amount of time
for you to do it yourself.

517
00:34:44,299 --> 00:34:46,475
- Okay, go rig your PA.

518
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:48,563
Hey, do me a favour. Um...

519
00:34:48,608 --> 00:34:51,654
let's cut out
this whole smug-asshole thing,

520
00:34:51,697 --> 00:34:54,135
'cause it's really working
my last nerve. Okay?

521
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:56,485
- Okay.

522
00:34:56,529 --> 00:34:58,183
Sorry, boss.

523
00:35:03,884 --> 00:35:05,538
Motherfucker.
Nik.

524
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,150
- A production assistant
on a show like this,

525
00:35:09,194 --> 00:35:12,632
um... you're basically
like a bus boy's assistant.

526
00:35:14,155 --> 00:35:17,941
Well, does this suck ass?
Mm-hmm.

527
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,945
Am I getting paid nearly enough
to do it?

528
00:35:21,989 --> 00:35:24,339
No fucking way.

529
00:35:27,212 --> 00:35:28,778
Hmm.

530
00:35:31,216 --> 00:35:32,782
Coach?

531
00:35:35,568 --> 00:35:38,397
Hey, uh... I'm really sorry
to bother you, but,

532
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,139
uh... we need to get
that microphone back.

533
00:35:41,574 --> 00:35:42,966
Hello?

534
00:35:47,057 --> 00:35:50,148
[sighing]
Don't be a puss. Ahem.

535
00:35:51,061 --> 00:35:54,239
Look, uh... Coach, I'm just...

536
00:35:54,282 --> 00:35:57,372
really wanted to apologize, uh,
about earlier today.

537
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,816
Oh, shit!

538
00:36:08,818 --> 00:36:12,170
What the fuck?
What the fuck is it?

539
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,480
Ah!

540
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,533
[indistinct announcement]

541
00:36:29,926 --> 00:36:34,888
- These days,
it doesn't seem that Erin cares
for Blanca too much.

542
00:36:34,931 --> 00:36:37,369
Uh, I believe she called
her a...

543
00:36:37,412 --> 00:36:40,502
a cocaine-fuelled gutter slut.

544
00:36:42,287 --> 00:36:44,114
- I need to talk to you.

545
00:36:45,551 --> 00:36:48,118
- Excuse me!
Get your hands off me, chunk!

546
00:36:48,162 --> 00:36:51,470
- I weigh 110 pounds!
That's not fat!

547
00:36:51,513 --> 00:36:55,125
[scoffing]
I have tried to be as nice
as I know how.

548
00:36:55,169 --> 00:36:57,998
That's over!
I'm giving you this warning.

549
00:36:58,041 --> 00:37:01,915
Stay away from Vance,
or I'm going to get my cousins
to go to your cabin

550
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:04,744
and have them hog-tie you
and weigh you!
Capisce?

551
00:37:06,746 --> 00:37:08,922
- You know what? Screw this!

552
00:37:08,965 --> 00:37:12,491
I don't need this bullshit,
this fucking method-acting crap!

553
00:37:12,534 --> 00:37:14,710
Hundred-and-ten pounds, my ass!

554
00:37:15,407 --> 00:37:17,017
Listen up, you little pisher!

555
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,411
I don't give a shit
if you're losing me,
this is important!

556
00:37:19,454 --> 00:37:21,891
It's the first time
I've had reception
since I've been out here.

557
00:37:21,935 --> 00:37:24,285
You tell Seaton
if he still wants me
as a client,

558
00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:27,288
he will get me
on the next goddamn plane
out of here, okay?!

559
00:37:27,332 --> 00:37:29,421
Do you hear me? Hello?

560
00:37:29,464 --> 00:37:31,814
Can you hear me now?

561
00:37:31,858 --> 00:37:35,383
Fuckity fuck, fuck, fuck!!!
[sighing]

562
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,086
- Thanks a lot, man.
- Alright.

563
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:45,001
- When's Desperate the Sound Elf
coming back?

564
00:37:45,045 --> 00:37:47,134
I feel like an idiot.
- Blanca.

565
00:37:47,177 --> 00:37:50,137
- Alright, we got five minutes
till game time. Is Nik back
with that microphone?

566
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,313
- He's not and there's no way
to reach him.

567
00:37:52,357 --> 00:37:54,968
And Lee said if he doesn't get
here in five, he's fired.

568
00:37:55,011 --> 00:37:59,015
- Oh, that's a little harsh,
huh?
- And where's Mike? Mike!

569
00:37:59,059 --> 00:38:01,540
- I'm right here.
The PA system is rigged.

570
00:38:01,583 --> 00:38:04,412
- Alright, good.
Let's get ready to shoot.

571
00:38:10,592 --> 00:38:12,638
[crowd cheering]

572
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,249
- Ah!

573
00:38:17,686 --> 00:38:21,299
[announcer]:
This season has been
nothing short of a phenomenon!

574
00:38:23,213 --> 00:38:25,085
[shouting]

575
00:38:25,128 --> 00:38:26,347
Goal!

576
00:38:26,391 --> 00:38:28,871
[buzzing]
[crowd cheering]

577
00:38:28,915 --> 00:38:33,049
The State Championship
is just a bus ride away
for the Gold Diggers.

578
00:38:40,187 --> 00:38:43,451
- Any sign of Nik?
- No.
- That's so weird.

579
00:38:44,104 --> 00:38:46,541
- Oh, hey, Coach.
Great game tonight.

580
00:38:46,585 --> 00:38:48,500
Hey, listen,
can I ask you a favour?

581
00:38:48,543 --> 00:38:50,328
- Favours aren't really
my specialty.

582
00:38:50,371 --> 00:38:51,981
[laughing]
- That's funny.

583
00:38:52,025 --> 00:38:54,070
I noticed you had a treadmill
upstairs in the gym.

584
00:38:54,114 --> 00:38:56,377
Would you mind if I grabbed
a quick workout?

585
00:38:56,638 --> 00:38:58,771
- You know,
I like your dedication, boy.

586
00:38:58,814 --> 00:39:01,513
More people should make fitness
a priority.

587
00:39:01,556 --> 00:39:03,297
We're clearing out, so...

588
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,126
just make sure to lock the doors
when you leave.

589
00:39:06,169 --> 00:39:08,302
- Thank you, sir.
- Ahem.

590
00:39:09,259 --> 00:39:11,479
- Oh, excuse me,
Coach Stick-up-your-Ass,

591
00:39:11,523 --> 00:39:13,916
do you think that I might
massage your penis
for a few minutes

592
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,005
so that I, too,
might get a workout?

593
00:39:17,616 --> 00:39:20,314
- Is it hard being
such a douchebag all the time?

594
00:39:22,403 --> 00:39:25,537
- Uh, no. No.
I actually kinda like it.

595
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,930
- Loser.

596
00:39:49,822 --> 00:39:51,867
[beep]
Luke for Daphne.

597
00:39:53,608 --> 00:39:55,218
[sighing]

598
00:39:55,262 --> 00:39:57,438
- Go ahead, Luke.

599
00:39:57,482 --> 00:40:00,310
- Was the Tahoe ever supposed
to be used as a cast car?

600
00:40:00,354 --> 00:40:03,226
- Not that I know of.
Phoebe handled all the rentals.
Why?

601
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:05,838
- It's just I found
a lipstick camera
rigged in the backseat.

602
00:40:05,881 --> 00:40:08,275
And I didn't put any
lipstick cameras
on the equipment order,

603
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:10,538
and this is the second one
I found.

604
00:40:10,582 --> 00:40:13,149
I didn't know this show
had that kind of surveil.

605
00:40:13,193 --> 00:40:16,457
- I didn't think so, either.
I'll ask.

606
00:40:16,501 --> 00:40:18,198
- Copy that.

607
00:40:29,905 --> 00:40:32,386
[heavy metal playing
through headphones]

608
00:40:35,911 --> 00:40:37,783
[wind whistling]

609
00:40:46,226 --> 00:40:48,184
Hello? I'm still up here.

610
00:40:48,968 --> 00:40:50,709
Ah, what the hell, man?

611
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:57,977
Hello?

612
00:41:12,121 --> 00:41:13,732
[beeping]

613
00:41:18,563 --> 00:41:21,870
I'm beginning to think
this workout
wasn't such a bright idea.

614
00:41:34,448 --> 00:41:36,102
[banging]

615
00:41:57,166 --> 00:41:58,907
[sighing]

616
00:42:02,607 --> 00:42:04,739
Ahem.
[sniffling]

617
00:42:05,566 --> 00:42:07,263
Whew.

618
00:42:07,307 --> 00:42:10,049
Oh! What the fuck?
Who are you, man?

619
00:42:15,228 --> 00:42:16,751
Ah!

620
00:42:57,139 --> 00:42:59,228
[grunting]

621
00:42:59,272 --> 00:43:00,969
Ah!

622
00:43:04,016 --> 00:43:05,713
Ah! Fuck!

623
00:43:06,714 --> 00:43:08,890
Ah! Ah!

624
00:43:12,677 --> 00:43:15,070
[crying out]

625
00:43:20,946 --> 00:43:22,817
Oh!
[groaning]

626
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,441
[background chatter]
[laughter]

627
00:43:39,834 --> 00:43:41,619
- Have a lovely day.

628
00:43:42,837 --> 00:43:44,578
[whispering]

629
00:43:46,885 --> 00:43:49,322
- Hey, I meant to ask,
did you guys

630
00:43:49,365 --> 00:43:51,629
pre-rig the cars with cameras
before we got up here?

631
00:43:51,672 --> 00:43:54,240
- Can we please not talk
about work for a second?

632
00:43:54,283 --> 00:43:56,677
I need a break from this show
and this town.

633
00:43:56,721 --> 00:43:58,984
And um, mm, more liquor?

634
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:05,643
- Hey, any sign of Greg or Nik?
- No. I thought
they'd be here already.

635
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,040
- Yeah.

636
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:17,742
Hello! Hey, sugar puss.

637
00:44:17,785 --> 00:44:20,396
Hi. See me standing here
with moolah in my hand?

638
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,050
No? Yes?

639
00:44:22,834 --> 00:44:25,271
Hi! Hello. How are you?

640
00:44:25,314 --> 00:44:29,405
- Atta girl.
- Looks like Miss Champion
found herself another victim.

641
00:44:29,449 --> 00:44:30,842
[gulping]

642
00:44:30,885 --> 00:44:34,323
- Okay... to the superstar
hockey player.

643
00:44:34,367 --> 00:44:37,326
- Well, to the super-hot
actress-slash-model.

644
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:41,243
- Okay. I've been called worse,
but anyway.

645
00:44:41,287 --> 00:44:42,941
Mm.

646
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:47,467
So, um...

647
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:49,904
I heard you were kind of close
to that girl that died.

648
00:44:49,948 --> 00:44:52,428
- Yeah, I guess, um...

649
00:44:52,472 --> 00:44:55,301
I guess you could say this went
from being the best year
of my life

650
00:44:55,344 --> 00:44:57,869
to the worst in, you know,
a blink.

651
00:44:57,912 --> 00:44:59,653
- I'm really sorry.

652
00:45:00,654 --> 00:45:03,396
My dad died when I was 14,

653
00:45:03,439 --> 00:45:05,920
and I thought
I would never get over it.

654
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:10,925
[sighing]
I mean, it doesn't go away,
but... it gets easier.

655
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:14,973
- Promise?

656
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,279
- Yeah.

657
00:45:19,412 --> 00:45:23,372
- Isn't he a little young
for her?
Is it still legal if it's a boy?

658
00:45:23,416 --> 00:45:27,159
- I heard she slept with that PA
who sued her,
and then she got tired of him,

659
00:45:27,202 --> 00:45:30,118
treated him like garbage
until finally he had enough.

660
00:45:30,162 --> 00:45:33,295
- See, that's how rumours
get started.
- You're saying it's not true?

661
00:45:33,339 --> 00:45:36,298
- I think the press likes
to paint Blanca as the bad girl,

662
00:45:36,342 --> 00:45:39,867
and I think sometimes she feels
obligated to live up
to those expectations.

663
00:45:39,911 --> 00:45:42,957
- I hate to be a buzz kill,
but I'm calling it a night.

664
00:45:43,001 --> 00:45:46,526
- Alright, do me a favour
and just be careful, please?

665
00:45:46,569 --> 00:45:48,180
- Okay.

666
00:45:56,536 --> 00:45:58,494
[phone ringing]
Hello?

667
00:45:58,538 --> 00:46:01,106
- I'm so glad I got through.
- Oh. Ha!

668
00:46:01,149 --> 00:46:04,413
Oh, my God, I can't even begin
to believe this.

669
00:46:04,457 --> 00:46:06,328
I haven't had reception
for days.

670
00:46:06,372 --> 00:46:08,417
It's so good to hear your voice.

671
00:46:08,461 --> 00:46:10,332
- Totally.
I've been trying forever.

672
00:46:10,376 --> 00:46:12,770
I was starting to get worried.
How's it going?

673
00:46:12,813 --> 00:46:16,599
- Oh, I need a margarita
and a Palm Springs weekend
like you wouldn't believe.

674
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:20,560
Cathy?
[beeping]

675
00:46:21,126 --> 00:46:22,780
Ah, dammit.

676
00:46:26,827 --> 00:46:28,829
[turning up music]

677
00:46:55,247 --> 00:46:56,901
Greg, are you okay?

678
00:46:59,033 --> 00:47:00,730
You been out here long?

679
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:03,124
Freeze to death.

680
00:47:05,474 --> 00:47:06,998
Greg?

681
00:47:08,869 --> 00:47:10,566
You stoned again?

682
00:47:11,654 --> 00:47:13,221
Oh, my God!

683
00:47:17,922 --> 00:47:19,488
[screaming]

684
00:47:35,069 --> 00:47:36,941
- What do you mean,
she didn't come home?

685
00:47:36,984 --> 00:47:39,726
- She wasn't in her bed
when I woke up.
I thought maybe she got lucky.

686
00:47:39,769 --> 00:47:41,902
- With who, Blanca?
We watched her leave alone.

687
00:47:41,946 --> 00:47:44,252
I can't believe
you didn't wake me up
when you saw that.

688
00:47:44,296 --> 00:47:46,167
- I thought maybe she hooked up
with you.

689
00:47:46,211 --> 00:47:49,214
I caught her checking my ass out
a couple times.
Get off my hump.

690
00:47:49,257 --> 00:47:51,259
I told you as soon as I got up.

691
00:47:51,303 --> 00:47:53,696
- Jake, Coach says
you have to be on the ice
in 10 minutes,

692
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:56,003
or you won't be allowed on
at all.

693
00:47:56,438 --> 00:47:58,092
Sorry.

694
00:47:59,354 --> 00:48:03,141
- Where's the rest of your crew?
- You know what, Lee?
I'd like to know the same thing.

695
00:48:03,184 --> 00:48:04,838
Something's really wrong here.
Luke is never late.

696
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:08,624
- I don't feel so good.
- Oh, Phoebe, pull it together.

697
00:48:08,668 --> 00:48:11,889
- Fuck you, Lee.
- What, again?

698
00:48:13,978 --> 00:48:17,459
Jake, you've got five minutes.
We don't have a show
without this game.

699
00:48:17,503 --> 00:48:20,462
- What do you want me to do?
Three quarters of my crew
is missing!

700
00:48:20,506 --> 00:48:24,423
- Like I told the last guy,
you're the director,
figure it out.

701
00:48:24,466 --> 00:48:26,991
- Sure thing. Bitch.
- I'm sorry, what was that?

702
00:48:27,034 --> 00:48:28,949
- You know what, Lee?
I'm beginning to understand

703
00:48:28,993 --> 00:48:31,386
why the first director
only lasted a few days. Yeah.

704
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:33,301
Keir, can you mix audio?

705
00:48:33,345 --> 00:48:37,305
- I can try.
- Okay. Blanca, I'm gonna need
you to hold the boom pole.

706
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:40,265
- Oh, my God, I'm so gonna
fucking kill my acting coach.

707
00:48:44,138 --> 00:48:45,835
- Hey, you know what?

708
00:48:45,879 --> 00:48:49,317
You do not talk to me that way
in front of the crew.

709
00:48:49,361 --> 00:48:52,190
You finish out the day;
after that, you're fired.

710
00:48:59,806 --> 00:49:01,329
Ah!

711
00:49:02,591 --> 00:49:04,985
- We just want to go
on record here

712
00:49:05,029 --> 00:49:08,032
that a bunch
of our crew members are missing,

713
00:49:08,075 --> 00:49:10,904
um, and Lee wants us
to shoot anyway.

714
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:14,168
But as soon as this is over,
we're gonna go find them.

715
00:49:22,611 --> 00:49:25,658
- We need to comb this school
and find that missing stuff.

716
00:49:25,701 --> 00:49:28,356
You can't hide monitors
that size in a suitcase.

717
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,576
You are the one
who will go down for this.

718
00:49:30,619 --> 00:49:33,579
- This isn't Bewitched, Lee.
I can't just wiggle my nose

719
00:49:33,622 --> 00:49:35,407
and make stuff appear
and whatnot.

720
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:38,845
- Just try to keep an eye
on things here if you can.

721
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,979
I'm gonna go get
the rest of the crew.

722
00:49:42,022 --> 00:49:44,546
One of those morons
is getting promoted to director.

723
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,333
[sighing]

724
00:49:48,376 --> 00:49:50,030
Go.

725
00:50:01,346 --> 00:50:03,000
Gotcha.

726
00:50:49,698 --> 00:50:51,396
Holy shit.

727
00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:00,883
What the fuck?

728
00:51:00,927 --> 00:51:02,755
Oh!

729
00:51:04,539 --> 00:51:06,367
Because...

730
00:51:06,411 --> 00:51:09,805
no one wants to watch a show
about some wittle hockey team.

731
00:51:09,849 --> 00:51:12,634
Oh, my God.
Am I being punked?

732
00:51:12,678 --> 00:51:16,377
I thought they'd cancelled
this show. Ashton!
[laughing]

733
00:51:16,421 --> 00:51:18,075
- Oh! Ah!

734
00:51:18,118 --> 00:51:19,946
No!

735
00:51:21,208 --> 00:51:23,428
Ah!
- What the fuck?
- No!

736
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:27,301
No!

737
00:51:28,737 --> 00:51:30,652
No!
[exclaiming]

738
00:52:15,349 --> 00:52:19,484
- Tell your camera guy
I didn't appreciate him leaving
the treadmill and the lights on.

739
00:52:19,527 --> 00:52:22,400
- Sorry, Coach.
That's not usually like him.
- Ah.

740
00:52:22,443 --> 00:52:25,620
The bus leaves tomorrow morning
at 5:30 a.m. for Fargo.

741
00:52:25,664 --> 00:52:27,318
It waits for no one.

742
00:52:28,667 --> 00:52:30,538
Vance, come on, let's go.

743
00:52:34,368 --> 00:52:36,588
- Blanca, help Keir
grab some of the stuff.

744
00:52:36,631 --> 00:52:40,505
- Why?
- Could you just help us
pack up the stuff, please?

745
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:44,030
- Jeez. Bitch.

746
00:52:44,073 --> 00:52:46,032
And they say I'm difficult.

747
00:52:46,728 --> 00:52:48,687
- Phoebe,
should we wait for you?

748
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:52,995
- Oh, I gotta get the releases
for tomorrow's game
and stop by the Mini-Mart.

749
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:55,389
I'll meet you guys
back at the crew cabin, okay?

750
00:52:55,433 --> 00:52:57,217
- Alright. Be careful.

751
00:53:10,404 --> 00:53:12,058
Luke? Nik?

752
00:53:12,101 --> 00:53:13,973
- Um, guys?
- Hello?

753
00:53:17,498 --> 00:53:21,676
- Oh, phone's dead. Shocking!
- It doesn't look like Luke
slept in his bed last night.

754
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:24,113
- No, and you're right,
'cause Daphne's bed
hasn't been slept in.

755
00:53:24,157 --> 00:53:26,725
It doesn't make any sense.
Where the hell's her truck?

756
00:53:26,768 --> 00:53:29,249
- Oh! Oh, my God!
- Oh!

757
00:53:29,293 --> 00:53:33,253
- Fucking shit!
[whimpering]
Oh, my God!

758
00:53:35,168 --> 00:53:37,475
- Oh, my God.
- Don't touch it!

759
00:53:37,518 --> 00:53:39,868
- Is that Mike's watch?
- Oh, God! What is it holding?

760
00:53:39,912 --> 00:53:43,220
- It's the fucking microphone
we lost at the cabin.
He must've went back to get it.

761
00:53:43,263 --> 00:53:46,658
- Ew! Oh, my God,
that fucking sick coach
must've cut his hand off!

762
00:53:46,701 --> 00:53:48,442
We gotta call the cops!

763
00:53:48,486 --> 00:53:51,097
- Okay, guys, guys, guys.
Calm down, calm down.
Check your phones.

764
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:53,795
Do you have any signal?
Keira, check your phone. Blanca.

765
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:57,277
- Oh!
- Blanca, check your phone.
- Over here. Clients love, love,

766
00:53:57,321 --> 00:53:59,279
love to bitch about problems
on locations.

767
00:53:59,323 --> 00:54:02,630
You know, "My wardrobe sucks."
"My trailer's not big enough."

768
00:54:02,674 --> 00:54:06,417
Uh... "They're housing me
in the woods."
I try not to take those calls.

769
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:09,289
By the time I return them,
they've usually worked it out
themselves.

770
00:54:09,333 --> 00:54:11,030
- No signal, nothing.
I have nothing.

771
00:54:11,073 --> 00:54:13,598
[Blanca exclaiming]

772
00:54:15,948 --> 00:54:17,645
What's this?

773
00:54:20,605 --> 00:54:23,303
What is that freaking mask?
Who is this?

774
00:54:23,347 --> 00:54:26,437
- Who cares?
Somebody is out there
who thinks it's okay

775
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,048
to chop people's hands off!

776
00:54:30,963 --> 00:54:32,181
Oh, God.

777
00:54:38,492 --> 00:54:42,061
- My God. That's Daphne.
- What?

778
00:54:42,104 --> 00:54:45,717
- I know that sign.
That's out
by Coach Hansen's cabin.

779
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,545
We gotta get out there.

780
00:54:53,638 --> 00:54:56,684
Guys, we gotta go.
She could still be alive.
Come on.

781
00:54:56,728 --> 00:54:58,382
Come on!

782
00:54:58,425 --> 00:55:00,514
- I can't even begin
to believe this.

783
00:55:07,086 --> 00:55:10,611
- Hey! Why are we stopping here?
- I'm gonna go
check out this site.

784
00:55:10,655 --> 00:55:14,006
I need you guys to stay here
and try to get in touch
with the cops, okay?

785
00:55:14,049 --> 00:55:16,791
I saw an old C.B. radio
in the principal's office.

786
00:55:16,835 --> 00:55:20,708
Tell them to meet me
by the Predator Roundup sign
by Hansen's cabin.

787
00:55:20,752 --> 00:55:23,537
- Oh, okay, so you're just gonna
go hang with the fucking killer?

788
00:55:23,581 --> 00:55:25,583
We gotta get back on the highway
and keep driving!

789
00:55:25,626 --> 00:55:28,325
I hate to break this
to you guys, but that girl
is probably dead.

790
00:55:28,368 --> 00:55:31,937
- And what if she's not, Blanca?
And what if Nik and Luke
and Greg need our help too?

791
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:34,200
- How are we even gonna
get in there? Here.

792
00:55:34,243 --> 00:55:36,768
Take these.
They gave them to me.
Jake, I'm going with you.

793
00:55:36,811 --> 00:55:39,118
- Wait, wait.
I'm not going in there
by myself.

794
00:55:39,161 --> 00:55:41,512
- Well, alright, fine.
You're coming with us, then.

795
00:55:41,555 --> 00:55:43,296
- Both of those choices suck!

796
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,429
- Well, Blanca, please pick one!

797
00:55:45,472 --> 00:55:49,868
- Ugh! Fine, I'll stay here,
but I'm taking your dog,
so you have to come back for me.

798
00:55:49,911 --> 00:55:52,871
- We are gonna come back.
Just go find that C.B. radio
and get us some help.

799
00:55:52,914 --> 00:55:54,873
And hey, hey, take this.

800
00:55:54,916 --> 00:55:56,440
- Oh.

801
00:56:33,912 --> 00:56:35,217
- Hello?

802
00:57:13,081 --> 00:57:14,822
[whimpering]

803
00:57:26,312 --> 00:57:29,750
- If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.

804
00:57:34,233 --> 00:57:35,930
[doorbell ringing]

805
00:57:44,765 --> 00:57:48,465
- Anyone here?
[crying]
- Coach?!

806
00:57:50,031 --> 00:57:54,209
- Who's back there?
[Phoebe whimpering]
Is that you, Phoebe?

807
00:57:54,253 --> 00:57:58,518
