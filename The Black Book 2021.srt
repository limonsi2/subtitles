00:00:23,894 --> 00:00:26,561
(gentle music)

4
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,493
- Good day, Sir,

5
00:00:56,493 --> 00:00:59,180
I was wondering if you might
have a certain book in stock.

6
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,210
- Sure, what are you looking for?

7
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,370
- One of the "For Dummies" books.

8
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:04,980
- Yes, I got many of them.

9
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,813
Which one?

10
00:01:05,813 --> 00:01:07,147
- "Acting For Dummies."

11
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,000
- Well, I don't think I have that one.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,330
- Okay, I'll tell you what,
I'll be back a little bit later.

13
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:14,980
And if you can get for
me, I'd appreciate it.

14
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,470
- Oh, of course, of course.

15
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:17,392
- Thank you very much.

16
00:01:17,392 --> 00:01:18,225
- Not a problem.

17
00:01:18,225 --> 00:01:19,480
You have a wonderful.

18
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,313
- You too.

19
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,913
(gentle music)

20
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:31,127
- Can I help you find something?

21
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,100
- How long have you guys have been here?

22
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,163
- Quite some time.

23
00:01:36,182 --> 00:01:39,098
- I don't remember this being here.

24
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,180
I could have sworn this was
a closed old shoe store,

25
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,030
about a week ago.

26
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:44,863
(store clerk laughing)

27
00:01:44,863 --> 00:01:46,420
- Shoe store.

28
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,890
Surely you must be mistaken.

29
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,350
We've been here for years.

30
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,920
Why, look at all the
dust in this old shop.

31
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,810
- So what kind of stuff
do you have in here?

32
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:59,009
- Books and the antique odd and end.

33
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:01,380
- You sure do you have
a collection of things.

34
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,213
- Thank you.

35
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,160
- Probably nothing that
would fit my collection.

36
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,340
- Oh, really?

37
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,979
What sort of collection do you have?

38
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,380
- Oh, it isn't a large collection,

39
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,110
but just a few first
editions, some signed copies,

40
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,200
oh, and mint condition of course.

41
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,663
- [Store Clerk] Of course, sir.

42
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,693
- Again, you probably have
nothing that would fit.

43
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,690
- Well, I may have one or two things.

44
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,480
- [Man] Oh yeah, what you got?

45
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,760
- In fact, I recently
obtained a fine first edition,

46
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,070
Mary Shelley, "The Modern Prometheus."

47
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,603
Signed by the author in 1818.

48
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,903
- Yeah.

49
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,650
Yeah, that's what I thought.

50
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,850
It's in rough condition.

51
00:02:49,913 --> 00:02:51,384
Yeah, that's not for me.

52
00:02:51,384 --> 00:02:53,233
- It's a bit worn, I suppose.

53
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:59,260
Here I have an, "Athanasius
Kircher Magnetica Opus."

54
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,050
From 1654 in excellent condition, Sir.

55
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,843
This could fetch a great
price in the right market.

56
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,530
- I've seen books like this

57
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,810
fetch good money and shows in Chicago.

58
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,660
- [Store Clerk] You already have one?

59
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,910
- Not any longer.

60
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,060
But, nah, it's not really
a what I'm looking for.

61
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,430
- So the first one, the
condition isn't right.

62
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,773
And the "Kircher" you already have one.

63
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:30,743
Or you're used to.

64
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,653
I may just have the book
that you can't pass up.

65
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,623
This is one of the rarest
books in the world, Sir.

66
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,320
The only one of it's kind.

67
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,829
- Really, I doubt that.

68
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:48,340
- Yes.

69
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,740
Be careful with that.

70
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,540
- I know how to handle books like this.

71
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,540
- Of course, Sir.

72
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,923
It's completely unique.

73
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,183
- How much?

74
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,660
- Well, like I said, it's extremely rare.

75
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,800
But for a collector like yourself,

76
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,943
I could come down a bit
on the price, $5,000.

77
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,200
- 5,000.

78
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,033
- Yes.

79
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,980
If you can't afford it,

80
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,060
it's completely understandable. Sir.

81
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,980
- Well for 5,000 it better be unique.

82
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,350
- The only one of it's
kind in the world, Sir,

83
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,423
it has a fascinating backstory.

84
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,200
- So if you're asking price is 5,000,

85
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,560
what was your original price?

86
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,553
- 10,000.

87
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,686
- Why is such a discount,
what's wrong with it?

88
00:04:36,686 --> 00:04:39,270
- It keeps coming back to me.

89
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,650
- Returned?

90
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,270
So you're trying to sell me buck.

91
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:45,240
- No, no, not returns, not at all, Sir.

92
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,940
I just keep finding it

93
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,630
in old estate sales that I obtain.

94
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:53,320
Or perhaps the owner is
looking to make some fast cash.

95
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,773
It's very valuable.

96
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,410
- Okay, I'll take it.

97
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,850
- [Store Clerk] Excellent.

98
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,330
- But if I find out it's junk,

99
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,300
I'm bringing it back and
getting my money back.

100
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,793
- Very good, excellent, Sir.

101
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,030
But I do want to in good
conscience to tell you,

102
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,130
this book has a history.

103
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,700
- Oh no, we've already
agreed on a price of 5,000.

104
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,220
You're not gonna raise the price on me.

105
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,280
- Oh no, not that, sir.

106
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,263
It's just, don't read it.

107
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,700
When you take it home,

108
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,680
just put it up on the
shelf and leave it there,

109
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,680
don't open it, Sir.

110
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,513
- [Man] Really?

111
00:05:33,513 --> 00:05:34,346
And why is that?

112
00:05:34,346 --> 00:05:38,580
- Well, it's said that
this book is cursed.

113
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,130
I don't put much stock
in those things myself

114
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,013
but you never know.

115
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,693
- Well,

116
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,423
I can do with it as a one now, it's mine.

117
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,993
- No, don't read it.

118
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,163
Thank you, come again.

119
00:06:00,055 --> 00:06:03,055
(suspenseful music)

120
00:06:54,568 --> 00:06:57,651
(car engine revving)

121
00:07:52,191 --> 00:07:54,858
(gentle music)

122
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,393
- Cursed.

123
00:08:13,838 --> 00:08:17,088
(gentle upbeat music)

124
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,060
- [Man] That was "Raggedy Man In Blue"

125
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,210
by The Travelers on Atlantic Records,

126
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,909
a new band to keep an eye
on as they climb the charts.

127
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,780
Local news time, 9:40.

128
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,580
Reports of vicious animal attacks

129
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,462
have spread closer to town.

130
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:44,860
- We don't need that mess right now.

131
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,480
- What if it was something important?

132
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,200
- It's the same stuff had
been listening to all week.

133
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,083
Don't worry, I'll protect you.

134
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,770
- You couldn't protect
yourself from crazed midget,

135
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,313
let alone some wild animal.

136
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,470
Whatever.

137
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,453
Look, I'm a tough customer.

138
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,900
I can handle anything
that's thrown my way.

139
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,733
- Oh yeah.

140
00:09:06,733 --> 00:09:08,010
- Yeah.

141
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,580
- You can take anyone, huh?

142
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,970
- Anyone.

143
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:13,220
- Why don't you take me
right now, tough guy.

144
00:09:14,566 --> 00:09:17,316
(both laughing)

145
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:19,660
What was that?

146
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:23,231
- It's probably just some.

147
00:09:23,231 --> 00:09:24,229
- Just a what?

148
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:26,582
- It's probably just
someone messing with us.

149
00:09:26,582 --> 00:09:28,040
(animal growling)

150
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,623
Hey, leave us alone.

151
00:09:30,482 --> 00:09:33,250
(animal growling)

152
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,350
You better leave or you're gonna be sorry.

153
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,240
- Oh, come on, don't.

154
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,800
- Look it's probably just
someone messing with us.

155
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,490
I'm gonna put it into to it right now.

156
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,673
- Just stay in the car.

157
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,460
Let's go back to town.

158
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,060
We don't need to mess with this.

159
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,943
Let's just go.

160
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:55,653
- Look, I'll be right back.

161
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,070
- Come on, get back in the car.

162
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,153
All right, come out cowards.

163
00:10:09,055 --> 00:10:12,138
(suspenseful music)

164
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,480
- Stop.

165
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,900
Let's just go.

166
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,900
(suspenseful music)

167
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:32,923
Hello.

168
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,533
Honey.

169
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,683
Come back to the car.

170
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:42,983
Come on.

171
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,193
This isn't funny.

172
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,090
I just wanna go home.

173
00:10:50,012 --> 00:10:53,095
(suspenseful music)

174
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,663
Sorry, I didn't see you there.

175
00:11:21,522 --> 00:11:24,355
(animal growling)

176
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:29,083
Excuse me, I'll be going
back to the car now.

177
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:36,712
(birds chirping)

178
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,830
- [Boy] See, I told you
I'd bring you dinner.

179
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:45,788
(animal growling)

180
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,538
(girl screaming)

181
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,833
- That dirty lying.

182
00:12:09,552 --> 00:12:12,635
(suspenseful music)

183
00:12:18,025 --> 00:12:19,150
- Quit playing with that.

184
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,426
I'm gonna tell mom.

185
00:12:21,426 --> 00:12:22,888
- Come on.

186
00:12:22,888 --> 00:12:24,338
You wanna see something cool?

187
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:28,180
- Mom said to go straight home.

188
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,540
- It'll just take a few minutes.

189
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,373
I know a way in.

190
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:33,250
- Mom said.

191
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,790
- Mom said, mom said.

192
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:35,940
Don't be a baby.

193
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,276
- I'm not a baby.

194
00:12:37,276 --> 00:12:38,800
- What was that?

195
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,633
- What was what?

196
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:40,993
- I think I heard something.

197
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,520
- The building's completely empty.

198
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,313
I've been in there a million times.

199
00:12:47,636 --> 00:12:50,221
- I don't think we should go in there.

200
00:12:50,221 --> 00:12:52,180
- I thought you said you weren't a baby.

201
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,013
Come on.

202
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,713
- Fine.

203
00:12:54,713 --> 00:12:56,177
Hey, wait for me.

204
00:13:00,023 --> 00:13:02,606
(man laughing)

205
00:13:13,652 --> 00:13:16,319
(man coughing)

206
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:24,700
- Just give us a name,

207
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,733
a location, anything.

208
00:13:27,668 --> 00:13:29,000
And this can all be over.

209
00:13:33,453 --> 00:13:36,536
(suspenseful music)

210
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,570
- They say no one knows his identity,

211
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,513
that he works in the shadows.

212
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:47,840
But we know that you
contracted the hitman,

213
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,563
called The Sorcerer, to kill my family.

214
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,183
Did you not have the
courage to do it yourself?

215
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,513
(man laughing)

216
00:14:07,324 --> 00:14:09,991
(man screaming)

217
00:14:14,273 --> 00:14:16,856
(man laughing)

218
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,670
My wife, my daughters.

219
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,933
You tell me where to find him.

220
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,703
- We know, you know.

221
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,733
Just give us something and this ends.

222
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:56,803
- Tell me, is it true what
they say about The Sorcerer,

223
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,823
that he has superhuman powers,

224
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,233
that anything he touches dies,

225
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,791
that the touch of his
own finger is so deadly,

226
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,510
that even if he scratched his own itch,

227
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,623
he would kill himself?

228
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:24,221
(man screaming)

229
00:15:35,931 --> 00:15:38,514
(man laughing)

230
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,450
You think this is a joke?

231
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,320
He murdered my wife,

232
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,970
my children.

233
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:54,553
(man laughing)

234
00:15:58,382 --> 00:16:01,655
(man screaming)

235
00:16:01,655 --> 00:16:04,655
(suspenseful music)

236
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,973
(man laughing)

237
00:16:16,848 --> 00:16:17,681
His hand.

238
00:16:19,222 --> 00:16:21,805
(man laughing)

239
00:16:22,962 --> 00:16:26,045
(suspenseful music)

240
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,363
This is your last chance.

241
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,380
Tell us where to find The Sorcerer

242
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,030
or are we start with your fingers.

243
00:16:43,057 --> 00:16:46,057
(suspenseful music)

244
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:48,623
No?

245
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,565
Do it.

246
00:16:51,565 --> 00:16:54,648
(saw blade spinning)

247
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,307
(man screaming)

248
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:09,723
You were saying?

249
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:16,750
- I swear, I didn't hire The Sorcerer.

250
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,733
I am The Sorcerer.

251
00:17:26,676 --> 00:17:29,677
(suspenseful music)

252
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:32,813
High five.

253
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,213
High four.

254
00:17:41,505 --> 00:17:43,917
(gun firing)

255
00:17:43,917 --> 00:17:46,500
(man laughing)

256
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,903
- No, don't, please.

257
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,380
I'll give you anything you want.

258
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,983
- I can't allow any witnesses.

259
00:18:14,711 --> 00:18:15,976
(girls screaming)

260
00:18:15,976 --> 00:18:16,809
- Run.

261
00:18:18,561 --> 00:18:21,561
(suspenseful music)

262
00:18:40,874 --> 00:18:42,523
- Help me.

263
00:18:42,523 --> 00:18:45,606
(suspenseful music)

264
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,230
- Give me your hand.

265
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,621
- No.

266
00:18:59,621 --> 00:19:02,371
(girl screaming)

267
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:08,267
- Get up, you have to get up, he's coming.

268
00:19:09,564 --> 00:19:10,838
Come on.

269
00:19:10,838 --> 00:19:14,182
You have to get up, we
have to get outta here.

270
00:19:14,182 --> 00:19:16,432
Hurry up, he's almost here.

271
00:19:17,317 --> 00:19:18,817
- Leave 'em alone.

272
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:23,823
- No.

273
00:19:32,307 --> 00:19:35,557
(gentle upbeat music)

274
00:19:41,816 --> 00:19:44,478
- Wait, what if somebody touches him?

275
00:19:44,478 --> 00:19:47,561
(saw blade spinning)

276
00:19:54,472 --> 00:19:57,472
(suspenseful music)

277
00:20:18,825 --> 00:20:21,575
(fire crackling)

278
00:20:24,163 --> 00:20:25,883
- Are you telling mom?

279
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:36,758
(gentle music)

280
00:21:52,693 --> 00:21:55,860
(clock alarm ringing)

281
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,990
- Carrie, time to get up.

282
00:22:01,327 --> 00:22:04,494
(clock alarm ringing)

283
00:22:10,175 --> 00:22:11,070
Hey, that's all you're gonna eat?

284
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:13,773
- Well yeah, go on, I gotta get my run in.

285
00:22:13,773 --> 00:22:16,990
- It's our vacation, we
gotta relax and have fun.

286
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,535
- I am having fun.

287
00:22:18,535 --> 00:22:20,115
And besides, if I don't workout,

288
00:22:20,115 --> 00:22:22,270
you might leave me for someone else.

289
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,383
- Better believe it.

290
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,432
Carrie, breakfast is ready.

291
00:22:28,432 --> 00:22:31,599
(alarm clock ringing)

292
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,206
Carrie, get up, honey.

293
00:22:36,206 --> 00:22:39,373
(alarm clock ringing)

294
00:22:42,471 --> 00:22:44,296
What is she doing?

295
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:47,463
(alarm clock ringing)

296
00:22:57,371 --> 00:22:59,930
Carrie, get up.

297
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,330
Don't make me come in there.

298
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:05,924
(alarm clock ringing)

299
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:10,685
Get up, we gotta get into town.

300
00:23:10,685 --> 00:23:12,356
(door knocking)

301
00:23:12,356 --> 00:23:13,221
Come on.

302
00:23:13,221 --> 00:23:16,388
(alarm clock ringing)

303
00:23:20,294 --> 00:23:22,070
Carrie, where are you hiding?

304
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,433
We need to go into town.

305
00:23:25,056 --> 00:23:25,889
Where are you?

306
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,303
It's not funny.

307
00:23:38,343 --> 00:23:41,964
(suspenseful music)

308
00:23:41,964 --> 00:23:42,797
Carrie.

309
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:49,135
(gentle music)

310
00:24:54,337 --> 00:24:57,087
(birds chirping)

311
00:25:02,957 --> 00:25:05,624
(gentle music)

312
00:25:24,885 --> 00:25:27,518
(birds chirping)

313
00:25:27,518 --> 00:25:30,149
- Hey, stay near the house.

314
00:25:30,149 --> 00:25:32,899
(birds chirping)

315
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,453
Izzy.

316
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,573
Izzy, where did you go?

317
00:25:51,776 --> 00:25:54,609
(birds chirping)

318
00:26:08,026 --> 00:26:09,730
Where did you get this?

319
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:12,502
- Tulip left it for me,
when we were playing.

320
00:26:12,502 --> 00:26:13,669
- Who's Tulip?

321
00:26:15,275 --> 00:26:16,325
- Just a little girl.

322
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:18,603
- Where is she?

323
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:20,983
- In the woods.

324
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,560
- [Monica] Why's a
little girl in the woods?

325
00:26:25,657 --> 00:26:26,957
- I guess she lives there.

326
00:26:27,907 --> 00:26:28,740
- Okay.

327
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:32,713
Let's go inside okay, get unpacked.

328
00:26:36,266 --> 00:26:39,016
(birds chirping)

329
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:48,680
Hey, Izz, it's time to get ready for bed.

330
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,040
- [Izzy] Mom, do I have to?

331
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,223
- Yes you do.

332
00:26:53,201 --> 00:26:54,440
You wanna have some fun tomorrow,

333
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,400
so you need to get some rest.

334
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,810
- [Izzy] But I don't wanna go to bed yet.

335
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:01,230
- Go take your shower, get your PJ's on.

336
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:04,943
- Can I play on my tablet for
a little bit after my shower?

337
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,910
- Just for an hour.

338
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:08,743
- Thanks, Mom.

339
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:45,350
- Hey, where did you get this?

340
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:10,266
(girl laughing)

341
00:28:19,677 --> 00:28:22,677
(voices chattering)

342
00:28:54,725 --> 00:28:57,073
Morning sleepy head.

343
00:28:57,073 --> 00:28:58,318
- Morning.

344
00:28:58,318 --> 00:28:59,576
- Did you sleep okay?

345
00:28:59,576 --> 00:29:00,723
- I guess.

346
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:04,280
- Ready to go on some adventures today?

347
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:10,563
- I was wondering if we
could just stay here?

348
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,810
- [Monica] Yeah.

349
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:13,663
You feeling okay?

350
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:17,560
- Yeah, I just don't really
feel like going anywhere today.

351
00:29:19,208 --> 00:29:20,041
- Okay.

352
00:29:24,141 --> 00:29:26,974
(birds chirping)

353
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:29,663
Hey, listen.

354
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:39,330
I know that things have been
really hard on you lately.

355
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,770
You know that your dad leaving

356
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:46,470
has nothing to do with you, right?

357
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:01,060
- Can I go sit outside

358
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,943
by myself for a while?

359
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,026
- Can I make you some tea?

360
00:30:12,026 --> 00:30:13,567
- No, I'm okay.

361
00:30:22,967 --> 00:30:25,460
- Are you sure you don't
want to go exploring?

362
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,560
- Yeah, I'm sure, Mom.

363
00:30:29,444 --> 00:30:31,880
- I thought you wanted to
have some fun this week.

364
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,380
- I am having fun.

365
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:35,163
- Drawing.

366
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,260
Drawing is fun?

367
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,543
- Yeah, I like it.

368
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,000
- That's really good.

369
00:30:55,302 --> 00:31:00,302
Is that you and me?

370
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,160
Who's that?

371
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:02,993
- That's Tulip.

372
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:04,893
- Who's Tulip?

373
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,120
- She's my friend,

374
00:31:08,018 --> 00:31:10,360
the one that lives in the woods.

375
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,193
- Oh yeah.

376
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,650
Is she nice?

377
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:20,030
- Yeah.

378
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:22,643
Her friend Robin's kind of
mean to her sometimes though.

379
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,460
- Is that kind of like that guy

380
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,910
that's mean to you at school?

381
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:34,993
- I guess so.

382
00:31:40,477 --> 00:31:42,210
- Is that one Robin?

383
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:43,483
- No, that's Carrie.

384
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:45,597
- Who's Carrie?

385
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:50,163
- She's a girl that Tulip
brings to play sometimes.

386
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,650
- Where's she from?

387
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,543
- She said that she stayed here once,

388
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:01,717
like a long time ago.

389
00:32:10,225 --> 00:32:11,058
- Why don't we pick up

390
00:32:11,058 --> 00:32:13,783
and at least go walk some trails together.

391
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:17,829
Please.

392
00:32:17,829 --> 00:32:18,662
- Okay.

393
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:23,086
Oh I guess so.

394
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,063
- Where did these rocks come from?

395
00:32:36,017 --> 00:32:38,490
Hey Izz, stay out near the house okay,

396
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:39,710
it's too late to be near the woods.

397
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:43,444
- But Tulip wanted me
to show her my drawings.

398
00:32:43,444 --> 00:32:45,390
- [Monica] You heard me, come one.

399
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:46,537
- Sorry, Tulip.

400
00:32:57,212 --> 00:32:58,280
- Izzy.

401
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,303
- What, Mom?

402
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,665
I'm not in the woods.

403
00:33:01,665 --> 00:33:03,970
- Okay, just come inside, come on.

404
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:04,803
- Why, Mom?

405
00:33:04,803 --> 00:33:06,170
I was having fun.

406
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:07,913
- I know baby, it's getting late.

407
00:33:14,436 --> 00:33:17,353
Izz, who was that man in the woods?

408
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,840
- What man, Mom?

409
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,870
- That man that I saw the
red cap, who was that?

410
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:25,153
- I don't know, Mom, I didn't see him.

411
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:30,173
- Okay, just if anyone comes,
you have to let me know, okay.

412
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:31,953
- Okay, Mom.

413
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,297
- Just go tidy up your
room, I'll make dinner.

414
00:34:02,553 --> 00:34:03,930
(suspenseful music)

415
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:05,440
Izzy.

416
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,975
Izzy, I told you it's too late.

417
00:34:07,975 --> 00:34:08,975
- What, Mom?

418
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,063
I just thought I saw something.

419
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:29,723
- Do you want me to help you with dinner?

420
00:34:29,723 --> 00:34:30,723
- Thank you.

421
00:34:41,607 --> 00:34:42,724
- Ow.

422
00:34:42,724 --> 00:34:44,391
- What's the matter?

423
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:48,759
Where are you getting these?

424
00:34:48,759 --> 00:34:51,373
- It must've been Tulip,
she probably left it for me.

425
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,900
- We don't put rocks in our bed, okay.

426
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,013
- [Izzy] I didn't.

427
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,100
- Then where does it come from?

428
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,900
- I told you, it must've been Tulip.

429
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,143
- No more rocks.

430
00:35:07,788 --> 00:35:10,788
(crickets chirping)

431
00:35:18,345 --> 00:35:21,956
- [Izzy] Tulip stop, no.

432
00:35:21,956 --> 00:35:22,789
- Izzy.

433
00:35:24,786 --> 00:35:27,763
- No, Tulip stop, I told you would flip.

434
00:35:27,763 --> 00:35:28,792
No,

435
00:35:28,792 --> 00:35:29,792
don't do it.

436
00:35:30,687 --> 00:35:31,739
Mom.

437
00:35:31,739 --> 00:35:32,822
- Izzy, Izzy.

438
00:35:34,262 --> 00:35:36,817
(suspenseful music)

439
00:35:36,817 --> 00:35:37,650
Izzy.

440
00:35:38,655 --> 00:35:39,488
Izzy.

441
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:41,780
Izzy.

442
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,613
Izzy.

443
00:35:43,832 --> 00:35:44,665
Izzy.

444
00:35:46,542 --> 00:35:47,752
Izzy, where are you?

445
00:35:47,752 --> 00:35:48,585
Izzy.

446
00:35:53,161 --> 00:35:53,994
Izzy.

447
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,343
Hey, have you seen my daughter?

448
00:36:10,345 --> 00:36:13,012
(gentle music)

449
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:46,680
- No.

450
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,803
No, babe no, I'm serious, I can't tonight.

451
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:55,563
I can't, I got to get
moving on this thesis.

452
00:36:58,388 --> 00:37:00,260
Yeah, I don't know, I don't know.

453
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:03,203
Maybe something like some
urban legends or something.

454
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,900
You know Dr. Gordon loves that shit.

455
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,440
No, no, I was just started tonight.

456
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,490
Yeah, I know, I know.

457
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:16,900
No, no.

458
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,890
Look, I definitely can't tonight,

459
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:19,723
all right, I can't.

460
00:37:19,723 --> 00:37:20,890
But you know what?

461
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:22,890
How about you and I do
something this weekend,

462
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:23,723
something nice?

463
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:26,737
Yeah.

464
00:37:26,737 --> 00:37:27,570
Yeah.

465
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,430
We'll go there okay.

466
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:30,313
Yeah, but just tonight,

467
00:37:30,313 --> 00:37:32,820
I just gotta make sure I have something

468
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,053
to run by him tomorrow.

469
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,593
Yeah.

470
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,003
Okay, I miss you too.

471
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:43,450
All right, all right.

472
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:45,690
Okay, I'll talk to you tomorrow.

473
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:47,510
Okay, good night.

474
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:48,730
I love you too.

475
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:49,563
Okay bye.

476
00:37:54,335 --> 00:37:56,918
(gentle music)

477
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,083
- [Man] Showtime.

478
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:30,220
- I don't wanna be a bother

479
00:38:31,613 --> 00:38:35,613
but I was told there would
be a bottle of water.

480
00:38:39,207 --> 00:38:41,790
(gentle music)

481
00:39:00,277 --> 00:39:01,110
- Come on.

482
00:39:02,944 --> 00:39:05,277
There's no way this is live.

483
00:39:08,488 --> 00:39:11,071
(man coughing)

484
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:18,322
- No.

485
00:39:21,311 --> 00:39:24,311
(suspenseful music)

486
00:39:40,261 --> 00:39:42,292
- What the fuck.

487
00:39:42,292 --> 00:39:45,292
(suspenseful music)

488
00:39:57,051 --> 00:40:00,327
(Wayne gasping)

489
00:40:00,327 --> 00:40:03,327
(suspenseful music)

490
00:40:08,991 --> 00:40:11,824
(woman screaming)

491
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:16,838
(suspenseful music)

492
00:40:28,966 --> 00:40:32,120
- And although these
stories sound plausible,

493
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:35,113
they crumble to myth at
the slightest of scrutiny.

494
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,593
Urban folklore.

495
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:42,820
Often these tall tales are rooted

496
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:45,653
albeit it distantly, in truth.

497
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,863
The Candy Man, for example,

498
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,700
and the old TV days,

499
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:56,090
he was not a slave that was murdered

500
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:58,690
for falling in love with a white woman.

501
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:03,663
Meet Dean Corll, the real Candy Man,

502
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:07,940
who murdered 28 boys from
low-income housing projects,

503
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:10,333
in Houston, in the early '70s.

504
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:18,973
Corll's family owned the
candy factory, by the way.

505
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,683
Hence the moniker.

506
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:28,394
Then again, in Houston in 1974,

507
00:41:28,394 --> 00:41:33,050
Ronald O'Bryan gained infamy
as yet another Candy Man

508
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:36,720
after lacing Halloween treats with cyanide

509
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,180
and distributing them to several children,

510
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,283
including his own.

511
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:44,040
And ever since then, superstitious parents

512
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:48,500
insist on x-raying their
children's Halloween candy

513
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,983
for razorblades.

514
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:57,590
But there's never been a proven case

515
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:01,830
where a stranger has intentionally
tried to harm children

516
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:04,003
by tampering with Halloween candy.

517
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,900
You see, O'Bryan's motive, apparently,

518
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,500
was to collect the insurance payouts

519
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,083
on his children's policies.

520
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,840
He gave poison candy to their friends

521
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,300
as a means of making the poisonings

522
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,913
look less targeted
towards his own children,

523
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:24,903
thereby it gained momentum.

524
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:29,640
And although these real life stories

525
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:33,230
have candy and urban
environments as elements,

526
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:37,560
they have nothing to do with
repeating names into mirrors

527
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,223
or hooks for hands, I'm afraid.

528
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:40,933
Mr. Vittol.

529
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:45,630
- Dr. Gordon, what about snuff films?

530
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:46,993
- You read my dissertation.

531
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,543
Same thing.

532
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:53,520
Not a single law enforcement
agency in the world

533
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:57,420
has been able to obtain
any proof whatsoever

534
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:00,040
that anyone has ever been paid

535
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:04,093
to murder another human being
on camera for entertainment.

536
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:10,110
In fact, the million dollar
reward for verifiable proof

537
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:14,233
that even the existence of one
snuff film actually exists,

538
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,503
remains unclaimed for decades.

539
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:20,360
Now that's not to say

540
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:23,070
that there hasn't been
some convincing fakes,

541
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:27,250
most notably in 1991, actor Charlie Sheen,

542
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:30,330
watched a Japanese film
so graphic in nature,

543
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:33,863
he was convinced it
had to be a snuff film.

544
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:39,123
He was so shaken that
he took the VHS tape,

545
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:41,460
yes, VHS tape.

546
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,750
(all laughing)

547
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:44,643
To the FBI in a panic.

548
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:51,540
Well agents quickly deduced
that it was clearly staged

549
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:54,693
as part of a horror film
series and nothing more.

550
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:59,083
Now with the agents having
a good laugh at his expense,

551
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:05,317
Mr. Sheen was not winning
that day, I can assure you.

552
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:09,320
- What about red rooms on the dark web?

553
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:13,680
You know like not indexed, hidden websites

554
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,980
where you can literally
get anything you want,

555
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:21,460
guns, drugs, contract
hits, shit like that.

556
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:23,697
- Wayne, if I recall correctly,

557
00:44:23,697 --> 00:44:25,990
"Silk Road" was shut down in 2013.

558
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:28,690
- But there are other websites
out there just like it.

559
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:31,390
- Do I smell a thesis?

560
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:35,673
- Yeah.

561
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:37,730
Yeah, I think so.

562
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:41,200
- And you'd like to explore
this snuff film myth

563
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,174
as it pertains to folklore
in the internet age.

564
00:44:44,174 --> 00:44:45,924
- Yeah, more or less.

565
00:44:46,918 --> 00:44:49,585
(gentle music)

566
00:45:24,085 --> 00:45:24,918
Oh shit.

567
00:45:30,801 --> 00:45:33,948
- [Man] We can see you Wayne.

568
00:45:33,948 --> 00:45:36,115
And the camera behind you.

569
00:45:39,169 --> 00:45:44,061
We want to see you turn that
camera off before we do.

570
00:45:44,061 --> 00:45:46,348
(suspenseful music)

571
00:45:46,348 --> 00:45:47,181
Now Wayne.

572
00:46:05,008 --> 00:46:06,555
Showtime.

573
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:08,978
(suspenseful music)

574
00:46:08,978 --> 00:46:10,090
- Oh God, no.

575
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:13,624
(suspenseful music)

576
00:46:13,624 --> 00:46:16,571
- [Man] We can hear you Wayne.

577
00:46:16,571 --> 00:46:20,821
You don't have to type all
those big college words.

578
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:25,236
Now decide.

579
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:32,070
If you want, we can choose for you.

580
00:46:32,913 --> 00:46:35,830
How about a nice Columbian necktie?

581
00:46:37,543 --> 00:46:38,376
- No, no.

582
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:40,540
No, just stop,

583
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:42,368
stop, please stop.

584
00:46:42,368 --> 00:46:44,951
(gentle music)

585
00:46:45,863 --> 00:46:47,354
How much to spare his life?

586
00:46:47,354 --> 00:46:50,203
- [Man] You're out of Bitcoins Wayne.

587
00:46:50,203 --> 00:46:54,133
But you still got nearly 10,000
in your checking account,

588
00:46:54,133 --> 00:46:55,707
that will do.

589
00:46:55,707 --> 00:46:58,374
(gentle music)

590
00:47:02,225 --> 00:47:03,058
- Okay.

591
00:47:04,311 --> 00:47:06,228
Okay, just tell me how.

592
00:47:07,341 --> 00:47:11,315
- [Man] Tomorrow, you
will receive instructions.

593
00:47:11,315 --> 00:47:14,859
And don't even think about
involving the police.

594
00:47:14,859 --> 00:47:16,109
Or he will die.

595
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:18,903
- No.

596
00:47:19,757 --> 00:47:22,340
(gentle music)

597
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,483
(car engine revving)

598
00:47:46,619 --> 00:47:49,369
(birds chirping)

599
00:48:02,323 --> 00:48:04,906
(gentle music)

600
00:48:14,557 --> 00:48:17,713
- [Man] Come inside Wayne,
to make the exchange.

601
00:48:17,713 --> 00:48:19,210
- Can I just leave this here

602
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:21,560
and you send him up to the door?

603
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:22,393
You know, that way I never.

604
00:48:22,393 --> 00:48:24,060
- [Man] Come inside.

605
00:48:26,601 --> 00:48:29,351
There are still plans to discuss.

606
00:48:36,033 --> 00:48:39,116
You can leave the money on the table.

607
00:48:40,061 --> 00:48:42,644
(gentle music)

608
00:48:45,732 --> 00:48:48,065
I will trust it's all there.

609
00:48:49,236 --> 00:48:53,069
- [Victim] Here, I'm in
here, don't let me go.

610
00:48:54,715 --> 00:48:57,298
(gentle music)

611
00:49:10,818 --> 00:49:11,818
- It's okay.

612
00:49:14,724 --> 00:49:17,724
(suspenseful music)

613
00:49:27,101 --> 00:49:29,018
- Remain seated please.

614
00:49:34,061 --> 00:49:39,061
- Dr. Gordon, I came to help you.

615
00:49:44,779 --> 00:49:49,362
Dr. Gordon, I came to help
you, why are you doing this?

616
00:49:50,607 --> 00:49:53,607
(suspenseful music)

617
00:50:03,043 --> 00:50:05,626
(Wayne crying)

618
00:50:07,858 --> 00:50:10,858
(suspenseful music)

619
00:50:31,317 --> 00:50:32,234
- Showtime.

620
00:50:36,174 --> 00:50:38,757
(gentle music)

621
00:51:02,996 --> 00:51:05,913
(car horn honking)

622
00:51:07,735 --> 00:51:10,818
(suspenseful music)

623
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:45,943
(cellphone ringing)

624
00:51:51,429 --> 00:51:53,503
- As authorities are
continuing their investigation,

625
00:51:53,503 --> 00:51:56,640
they're urging everyone to stay indoors.

626
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,160
They believe the infection may be airborne

627
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,156
and it can be passed
through casual contact.

628
00:52:01,156 --> 00:52:02,580
- No, change that.

629
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:03,500
- Please continue

630
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:06,080
to stay in your homes.
- Dad, I'm scared.

631
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:08,340
- Do not let anybody in.

632
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:10,390
We will stay with you throughout the day.

633
00:52:12,899 --> 00:52:14,450
- Jennifer.

634
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:17,450
(suspenseful music)

635
00:52:32,247 --> 00:52:33,080
- God.

636
00:52:38,256 --> 00:52:39,633
- Let me in, please, I need you.

637
00:52:39,633 --> 00:52:41,550
- What happened to you?

638
00:52:42,395 --> 00:52:44,395
- Please just let me in.

639
00:52:47,806 --> 00:52:49,639
Just don't let me die.

640
00:52:52,661 --> 00:52:54,078
Don't let me die.

641
00:52:55,288 --> 00:52:58,288
(suspenseful music)

642
00:52:59,756 --> 00:53:02,423
(man screaming)

643
00:53:09,385 --> 00:53:10,218
Let me in.

644
00:53:11,326 --> 00:53:12,159
Let me in.

645
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:16,570
(suspenseful music)

646
00:53:19,271 --> 00:53:20,315
- Everything's busy.

647
00:53:20,315 --> 00:53:22,820
I have tried Jennifer, 911, my mom.

648
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:26,420
- Probably all jammed up, cable's out too.

649
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:27,750
- What's going on?

650
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:28,713
- Come here, honey.

651
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:35,030
- I'll be right back.

652
00:53:36,610 --> 00:53:38,270
- Where are you going?

653
00:53:38,270 --> 00:53:40,760
- My dad's old scanner in the attic,

654
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,160
I wanna see what's going on.

655
00:53:45,848 --> 00:53:48,931
(suspenseful music)

656
00:53:50,826 --> 00:53:53,329
- What are you doing, Brad?

657
00:53:53,329 --> 00:53:56,329
(suspenseful music)

658
00:54:28,249 --> 00:54:31,082
(woman screaming)

659
00:54:35,771 --> 00:54:39,021
(car tires screeching)

660
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:49,180
- "They're here."

661
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:53,080
Was the message sent out by The Pentagon.

662
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:56,242
This footage was sent to us by a viewer.

663
00:54:56,242 --> 00:54:59,692
(suspenseful music)

664
00:54:59,692 --> 00:55:00,775
- [Girl] Mom.

665
00:55:02,169 --> 00:55:03,002
Dad.

666
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,794
- You'll have nightmares.

667
00:55:09,794 --> 00:55:11,150
- What was that?

668
00:55:12,407 --> 00:55:13,657
- I don't know.

669
00:55:16,132 --> 00:55:19,132
(suspenseful music)

670
00:55:26,853 --> 00:55:29,936
(cellphone ringing)

671
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:42,360
- We are waiting on President
Armstrong to make a statement.

672
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:44,410
We've been told the
president will be speaking

673
00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:47,930
from the Presidential
Emergency Operations Center.

674
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:50,900
The PEOC was built by FDR

675
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,940
under the east wing of The White House

676
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:57,500
to provide a secure place in
the event of an emergency.

677
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:00,550
We are going to the president now.

678
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:03,360
- My fellow Americans and
citizens of the earth,

679
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,230
we are under attack.

680
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:07,840
The enemy is of an alien nature.

681
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:11,250
All attempts to communicate
with the aliens have failed.

682
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:14,150
The CDC, NASA and The Military

683
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:17,170
are working together to find answers.

684
00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:19,470
I urge you to stay in your homes

685
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:22,150
while solution is investigated.

686
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:24,020
What we know at this time

687
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:27,240
is these aliens are symbiotic by nature

688
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:29,320
and are moving from host to host

689
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:32,230
in an attempt to find nourishment.

690
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:34,100
They are small creatures,

691
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:37,190
similar to ants in collective behavior

692
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:40,513
and transfer from host
to host through the eyes.

693
00:56:41,370 --> 00:56:44,460
Signs of infection include pasty skin,

694
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:48,580
a look of fatigue and red or bloody eyes.

695
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:52,270
Now we do know that if a
symbiote does not find a new host

696
00:56:52,270 --> 00:56:55,170
within minutes of leaving a deceased host,

697
00:56:55,170 --> 00:56:57,720
that symbiote will die.

698
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:01,440
As we look for resistance
for those infected,

699
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:06,430
I urge you to protect yourselves,
seal your environment,

700
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:09,450
do not leave your home or place of work

701
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:12,410
and do not open windows
or doors for anyone.

702
00:57:12,410 --> 00:57:14,423
They may be infected.

703
00:57:14,423 --> 00:57:17,506
(suspenseful music)

704
00:57:29,770 --> 00:57:30,603
- Help me.

705
00:57:34,730 --> 00:57:35,760
Need scissors.

706
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:36,880
- I'll get them.

707
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,240
- What are you doing?

708
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,073
- [Man] Hold this.

709
00:57:39,073 --> 00:57:40,970
- No, why are we doing this?

710
00:57:40,970 --> 00:57:41,803
- Didn't you see the president?

711
00:57:41,803 --> 00:57:44,230
- No, I shut off the TV.

712
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:45,430
- There's been some kind of invasion,

713
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:49,050
small ant-like creatures,
they get in through your eyes.

714
00:57:49,050 --> 00:57:51,366
They control you to their
next source of nourishment.

715
00:57:51,366 --> 00:57:53,410
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

716
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:56,000
So they're saying, we're food?

717
00:57:59,257 --> 00:58:00,090
- Got 'em.

718
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,570
- We seal this place up, best we can

719
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:09,530
and then stay put.

720
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:12,530
(suspenseful music)

721
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,252
- What about sis?

722
00:58:20,252 --> 00:58:23,252
(suspenseful music)

723
00:58:38,252 --> 00:58:41,585
(car brakes screeching)

724
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:44,719
- I didn't see you.

725
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:46,475
I'm so sorry.

726
00:58:46,475 --> 00:58:47,892
- Don't let them.

727
00:58:50,554 --> 00:58:51,804
Don't let them.

728
00:58:54,484 --> 00:58:55,756
No, no.

729
00:58:55,756 --> 00:58:58,756
(suspenseful music)

730
00:59:45,626 --> 00:59:47,386
- Darling, we need more tape.

731
00:59:47,386 --> 00:59:48,219
- Okay.

732
00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:54,486
(suspenseful music)

733
00:59:54,486 --> 00:59:55,319
Mom,

734
00:59:56,209 --> 00:59:57,170
Dad.

735
00:59:57,170 --> 00:59:58,813
- [Woman] What is it baby?

736
00:59:58,813 --> 01:00:00,343
(suspenseful music)

737
01:00:00,343 --> 01:00:01,176
Jenny.

738
01:00:02,063 --> 01:00:03,527
- What, where?

739
01:00:03,527 --> 01:00:05,350
- She was just there.

740
01:00:05,350 --> 01:00:06,460
- There's no one out there.

741
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:08,670
- [Girl] I could have
sworn I just saw her.

742
01:00:08,670 --> 01:00:10,983
- Let's go get some more tape.

743
01:00:14,753 --> 01:00:17,753
(suspenseful music)

744
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:21,578
Jenny.

745
01:00:21,578 --> 01:00:23,232
Jenny.

746
01:00:23,232 --> 01:00:26,232
(suspenseful music)

747
01:00:32,172 --> 01:00:33,709
Jenny's outside.

748
01:00:33,709 --> 01:00:35,230
- [Girl] Dad.

749
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:36,063
- Help.

750
01:00:37,309 --> 01:00:38,142
- Jenny.

751
01:00:40,177 --> 01:00:41,010
We can't.

752
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:43,789
- We can't save our daughter?

753
01:00:43,789 --> 01:00:45,539
- She's dead already.

754
01:00:48,594 --> 01:00:51,261
(gentle music)

755
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:55,000
- Since mankind first
saw it's own reflection,

756
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,150
we have been fascinated by her own image

757
01:01:57,150 --> 01:01:59,300
staring back at us.

758
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:01,130
Ancient cultures believed that a mirror

759
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:02,623
was a reflection of the soul.

760
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:06,393
Which is why breaking it is bad luck.

761
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,470
And why vampires have no reflection

762
01:02:12,590 --> 01:02:14,720
because they have no soul.

763
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:15,886
Others like myself.

764
01:02:15,886 --> 01:02:16,719
(girls laughing)

765
01:02:16,719 --> 01:02:19,143
Believe they are a portal
to other dimensions.

766
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:27,903
Whatever you do do not
think about a white bear.

767
01:02:33,270 --> 01:02:34,710
That's right.

768
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:37,793
Do not think about a white bear.

769
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:40,930
There was a study once

770
01:02:40,930 --> 01:02:44,330
where people were told not
to think about a white bear,

771
01:02:44,330 --> 01:02:47,100
they spent the next few minutes
trying everything they could

772
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:49,400
to not think about a white bear,

773
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:50,810
but failed.

774
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:52,310
Why?

775
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:54,960
When we try to suppress a
thought, two things happen.

776
01:02:56,270 --> 01:02:57,870
We consciously searched for thoughts

777
01:02:57,870 --> 01:02:59,853
that do not involve white bears.

778
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:03,040
Conversely, we analyze each thought

779
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:06,040
to make sure they don't
involve white bears.

780
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:11,040
The problem is both thought
processes involve white bears.

781
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:17,650
So when you go home tonight
and you look into the mirror,

782
01:03:17,650 --> 01:03:21,374
do not say, "Mirror, mirror on the wall."

783
01:03:21,374 --> 01:03:24,041
(all laughing)

784
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:28,633
But seriously,

785
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:33,627
never ever look into the mirror and say,

786
01:03:33,627 --> 01:03:38,507
"No devil, never odd or even, lived on."

787
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:42,633
See you on Monday.

788
01:03:58,545 --> 01:04:01,628
(suspenseful music)

789
01:04:08,889 --> 01:04:10,797
- No devil never odd or even.

790
01:04:10,797 --> 01:04:13,810
(telephone ringing)

791
01:04:13,810 --> 01:04:15,000
Hey Jill, what's up?

792
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,880
- [Jill] Are you coming to the party?

793
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:19,317
- I'm getting ready now.

794
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:21,840
Are you guys already there?

795
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:23,440
- [Jill] Yeah, we just got here.

796
01:04:24,450 --> 01:04:27,450
- Well text me if Zack's there.

797
01:04:27,450 --> 01:04:29,150
- [Jill] Girl, you need to stop

798
01:04:29,150 --> 01:04:31,810
obsessing about your ex-boyfriend.

799
01:04:31,810 --> 01:04:32,933
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

800
01:04:39,845 --> 01:04:41,050
Hah.

801
01:04:41,050 --> 01:04:42,000
- [Jill] Hah, what?

802
01:04:43,790 --> 01:04:44,623
Shannon?

803
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:46,580
- Do you remember the phrase

804
01:04:46,580 --> 01:04:48,650
the professor said in class today?

805
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:49,680
- [Jill] The white bear?

806
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:52,633
- No devil, never odd or even, lived on.

807
01:04:53,538 --> 01:04:55,880
- [Jill] Oh yeah, now I remember.

808
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:59,420
Hey, make sure you don't say
while looking into a mirror.

809
01:04:59,420 --> 01:05:01,573
- Too late, I think I already did.

810
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:03,600
- [Jill] Whatever.

811
01:05:04,678 --> 01:05:07,000
Hurry your ass up, we're here

812
01:05:07,890 --> 01:05:11,120
and so is Zack, FYI.

813
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:14,530
- All right, see you later, bye.

814
01:05:14,530 --> 01:05:15,363
- [Jill] Later.

815
01:05:16,225 --> 01:05:19,308
(suspenseful music)

816
01:05:30,279 --> 01:05:32,575
(Shannon screaming)

817
01:05:32,575 --> 01:05:33,933
- Hello Shannon.

818
01:05:35,679 --> 01:05:36,679
- Oh my God.

819
01:05:45,047 --> 01:05:47,130
- Thanks for inviting me.

820
01:05:51,805 --> 01:05:52,995
(Shannon choking)

821
01:05:52,995 --> 01:05:54,453
- Hello.

822
01:05:54,453 --> 01:05:55,401
Shannon.

823
01:05:55,401 --> 01:05:56,453
(Shannon screaming)

824
01:05:56,453 --> 01:05:57,286
Shannon.

825
01:05:58,135 --> 01:05:59,767
Oh my God.

826
01:05:59,767 --> 01:06:02,767
(Shannon screaming)

827
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:16,545
(glass vase breaking)

828
01:06:16,545 --> 01:06:19,628
(suspenseful music)

829
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:25,840
- [Operator] 911, what's your emergency?

830
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:29,122
- I think something's
happened to my friend.

831
01:06:29,122 --> 01:06:32,122
(suspenseful music)

832
01:06:35,506 --> 01:06:38,339
(camera clicking)

833
01:06:43,737 --> 01:06:46,820
(suspenseful music)

834
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:01,440
She was supposed to meet up
with us, but then I got a call.

835
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:02,713
She was screaming.

836
01:07:03,590 --> 01:07:07,010
- Did you hear anything
else, another person maybe?

837
01:07:07,010 --> 01:07:09,923
- No, just screaming.

838
01:07:13,970 --> 01:07:16,270
- Green, I think I found something.

839
01:07:16,270 --> 01:07:19,123
No devil, never odd or even, lived on.

840
01:07:20,038 --> 01:07:22,150
Does that mean anything to you?

841
01:07:22,150 --> 01:07:23,640
- Doesn't sound familiar.

842
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,610
- It's from class.

843
01:07:25,610 --> 01:07:26,510
- What does it mean?

844
01:07:26,510 --> 01:07:27,343
- I don't know.

845
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:28,330
Just our psych professor

846
01:07:28,330 --> 01:07:29,430
told us you should never say it

847
01:07:29,430 --> 01:07:31,130
in front of a mirror or something.

848
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:34,000
- The girls say it's some superstition

849
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,582
about opening portals in the mirror.

850
01:07:36,582 --> 01:07:39,665
(suspenseful music)

851
01:07:45,470 --> 01:07:46,470
- What time was the?

852
01:07:48,490 --> 01:07:49,393
Roberts?

853
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:53,583
Roberts?

854
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:55,653
Wait here.

855
01:07:59,750 --> 01:08:00,583
Roberts?

856
01:08:03,549 --> 01:08:05,370
I hope this works.

857
01:08:05,370 --> 01:08:09,277
No devil, never odd or even, lived on.

858
01:08:09,277 --> 01:08:11,229
(gun firing)

859
01:08:11,229 --> 01:08:14,229
(suspenseful music)

860
01:08:32,282 --> 01:08:35,115
(Green screaming)

861
01:08:37,712 --> 01:08:38,546
Help me.

862
01:08:43,573 --> 01:08:44,406
No.

863
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:46,512
No.

864
01:08:50,986 --> 01:08:53,403
(gun firing)

865
01:09:00,728 --> 01:09:01,759
Easy, easy.

866
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:02,740
You're safe.

867
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:04,130
- The professor.

868
01:09:04,130 --> 01:09:06,671
- He's not gonna hurt
you anymore all right.

869
01:09:06,671 --> 01:09:08,843
Let's get outta here.
- Hello.

870
01:09:08,843 --> 01:09:09,675
Detective.

871
01:09:11,741 --> 01:09:13,950
(mirror knocking)

872
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:14,782
Are you there?

873
01:09:18,979 --> 01:09:20,303
- Jill, Brandi.

874
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:23,653
- How do you suppose we get outta here?

875
01:09:23,653 --> 01:09:24,486
- [Jill] Are you there?

876
01:09:24,486 --> 01:09:27,523
- I think we have to say
the phrase backwards.

877
01:09:27,523 --> 01:09:29,842
- [Jill] Hello, detective.

878
01:09:29,842 --> 01:09:32,410
- Backwards seems forwards.

879
01:09:32,410 --> 01:09:33,568
- Yeah, I know.

880
01:09:33,568 --> 01:09:35,612
(both laughing)

881
01:09:35,612 --> 01:09:37,362
- I think we should say the phrase.

882
01:09:38,580 --> 01:09:39,413
- No way.

883
01:09:40,370 --> 01:09:44,313
- [Both] No devil, never
odd or even, lived on.

884
01:09:49,785 --> 01:09:52,702
(Brandi screaming)

885
01:09:53,612 --> 01:09:54,555
- Shannon.

886
01:09:54,555 --> 01:09:57,138
(all laughing)

887
01:09:58,147 --> 01:09:58,980
Oh no.

888
01:10:00,382 --> 01:10:03,549
(gentle upbeat music)

889
01:10:32,730 --> 01:10:35,080
- Hey, can you take this
box to the book store,

890
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:36,980
I think it closes in an hour.

891
