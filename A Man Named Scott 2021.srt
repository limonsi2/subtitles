PHARRELL WILLIAMS:
Well, the Internet was just

4
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:28,529
opening things up so widely
that there were only

5
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:31,949
maybe a handful of archetypes
in the industry

6
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,327
that were representing
only a part of what it is

7
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:37,079
that we were thinking
and feeling,

8
00:00:37,163 --> 00:00:39,457
and so we just were like,
let’s just go.

9
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,460
Let’s just completely
be ourselves, unabashedly,

10
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:43,669
and be...

11
00:00:43,753 --> 00:00:47,798
very proud
of what and who we are.

12
00:00:47,882 --> 00:00:51,051
And what and who we are is, like--

13
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:54,555
where we come from
made huge impressions on us.

14
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:56,932
Huge impressions on our spirits
and on our bodies

15
00:00:57,016 --> 00:01:00,853
and what we wore and how we talked.

16
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:04,273
So, when you mention Cudi

17
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:08,944
and the, like, ever-growing,
ever-expanding generation of folks

18
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:12,156
who do not adhere to boundaries,

19
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,160
we’re doing it because we’re human
and it’s our right.

20
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:19,538
We can’t edit what we were exposed to

21
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:23,083
and what helped to form
the way we see the world,

22
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:27,087
so we’re not gonna edit the result.

23
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:30,466
We now have the opportunity.

24
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:32,426
We are in front of cameras.

25
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,012
We are behind microphones.
We are behind keyboards.

26
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:38,808
We are the pushers of pencils and pens.

27
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:43,020
And no one can tell us
how to express ourselves.

28
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,439
In different modes of creativity,

29
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:49,193
there are different formulas,
and all of that is subject to change.

30
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,487
In fact, that’s one thing
I’ve learned about this life,

31
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,156
is nothing is really fixed.

32
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,284
All of it can be changed.

00:01:58,452 --> 00:01:59,870

CUDI:
My mom always used to say, like,

50
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:25,831
"You were born to be
on someone’s television."

51
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:27,458
And I’d be like, "Ah, yeah, right.

52
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,668
That’s not for me."

53
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:32,796
But, like, hanging out, I was always on.

54
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:37,593
I’m Kid Cudi, an artist out of,
uh, Cleveland, Ohio.

55
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:41,305
I started pursuing music when I was 15.

56
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:45,017
I started writing, like, poems,

57
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,646
like, after my father passed away
when I was 11.

58
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:52,358
I-I started trying to get in the game,
doing talent shows,

59
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:55,194
um, all types of shit, like open mics,

60
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:58,364
like, anything I could get
my name out there.

61
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:01,075
Freestyle battles, all that shit.

62
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:05,329
With my music,
I’m definitely trying to inspire.

63
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:10,084
And my movement is a inspirational one.

64
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:15,339
I’m trying to lead the new movement
to open kids’ minds about that.

65
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,633
And in Cleveland,
it’s like there’s no room for that.

66
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:20,386
And if, you know,
you try to do something different,

67
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:24,014
it’s like... motherfuckers is like,
"Who this nigga?"

68
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:26,976
You know what I’m saying?
Like, "Stick to the script."

69
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:29,853
-I felt like...
-(crowd cheering)

70
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,271
fuck that.

71
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:33,148

I call myself Old Dot da Evil Genius,
baby, you know,

78
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,085
’cause I got that crack
for the street, man.

79
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:55,212
You know, I’m the George Jefferson
of the ghetto, man.

-(laughter)
-DOT: As far as rap,

81
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,549
at that moment, I had only worked

82
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,551
with all the drug dealers
in my neighborhood.

83
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,304
We become closest friends,
and he would come over,

84
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:09,893
and we’d be working on music
from like 7:00 p.m. to like 7:00 a.m.

85
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,437
We got Kid Cudi. You know what I’m saying?

86
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,564
That nigga’s about to drop,
so look out for the Kid, man.

87
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:14,815
-Kid Cudi.
-From the Midwest side.

88
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:15,899
-Ah, man.

89
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,609
DOT:
It was obsessive.

90
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:19,862
Like, we didn’t do anything.

00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:21,947
-Just make music.
-DOT: Cowboy Cudi.

92

-Let’s go hit up Carl’s Jr.
-(Dot laughing)

93
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,325
Let’s go see what they got.

94
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:27,453
DOT:
Cudi was one of the first few people I met

95
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:30,998
that it seemed like he didn’t care
about what anyone thought.

96
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,459
Where the fuck did you get
that shirt from?

97
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:34,918
Uh-oh.

98
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,879
Where’s he going? Come back!

99
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,339
(laughing)

100
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:40,674
It was different for me.

101
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:42,134
I’m from Brooklyn, man.

102
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:43,552
We... It’s about rap

103
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,179
at the end of the day,

104
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,014
but he was just bringing
musical references

105
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:49,433
that I was not paying any attention to.

106
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,268
Pretty much, like,
all I’ve been listening to is,

107
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,520
like, shit other than hip-hop.

108
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:55,189
Like, I’ve been zoning out, listening to

109
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,024
some Coldplay, you know, John Mayer.

110
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:58,150
You know what I’m saying?

111
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,027
Like, a lot of other shit like, you know,

112
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,238
alternative music, rock, old-school rock,

113
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:05,783
Electric Light Orchestra, Queen.

114
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,951
Whole bunch of shit like that,
man, Crash Test Dummies.

115
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:10,454
I just been zoning out,
listening to a lot of different music

116
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,164
so I could incorporate it in mine--

117
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:13,999
you know what I’m saying?--
as far as, like,

118
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,043
you know, good substance.

119
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:23,175
SCHOOLBOY Q:
Most of my homeys never left California

120
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,886
until I, like, put ’em on a plane.

121
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:32,684
When you really get to travel the world
and you get so far away from it,

122
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:36,605
you look at it like, "Whoa."

123
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:39,566
The ghetto’s so small. That’s all you see.

124
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,318
That’s all you know.
What else you gonna do?

125
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,487
Like, what else you gonna rap about?

126
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,863
What else you gonna...

127
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:46,824
want to listen to?

128
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:50,369
That’s why I try to get my homeys out
and expand they mind a little bit.

129
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:55,499
You can get distracted because most of

130
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,584
y-your main homeys,
they ain’t into this shit.

131
00:06:57,668 --> 00:06:59,336
So, even when you get in the car,

132
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,838
they’re only playing
a certain type of shit.

133
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,715
You go to their house,
they’re only doing a certain type of shit.

134
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:05,467
They dress only a certain type of way.

135
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:08,095
But there’s just so much space
out there, like...

136
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:11,098
Like, niggas is walking
on the moon and shit.

137
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:14,560
You know, when you get
bored of one thing, do the next.

138
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:16,937
We’re just creators, man.
We just want to create.

139
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:23,569
And it kind of makes you a weirdo,
you know, but it’s a dope thing.

140
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:28,448
Like, we come up with a whole
fucking thing from just the sound of air.

141
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:30,868
Our imagination is crazy.

142
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:35,455
So, it’s just being open to new things.

143
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:37,791
You never know. It might change your life.

144
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:41,962
He held down some jobs.

145
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,630
You know, kept getting fired.

146
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:45,799
This was actually a talk
that he had with my parents,

147
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:48,135
’cause he got evicted,
and they was letting him live,

148
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:51,388
but then after a while, it was like,
"Yo, you got to do something.

149
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,140
Like, you can’t just
stay at home all day."

150
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:56,560
And he was like,
"I don’t want to work no more."

151
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,645
He was like, "I want to just do music."

152
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:00,063
We was all in the room,

153
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,107
like...

154
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:04,818
Man, shit, ’cause we,
you know, living in the hood,

155
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:08,488
no glimmer of anything happening at all.

156
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:10,365
And he’s just like,
"It’s gonna work. Trust me.

157
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:11,909
I don’t need a plan B."

158
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:17,915
Cudi would just have ideas in his head,
and he’ll just shoot ’em to me, like,

159
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,583
"Yo, I think we should sample this.

160
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:20,751
"Listen to this rap.

161
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,169
What you think about this?" And...

162
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,129
He had an idea

163
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:27,216
for-for this song.

164
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:29,051
(melody from Kid Cudi’s
"Day N Nite" plays)

165
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:31,803
He had the song
pretty much written in his head.

166
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:36,016
I remember it being a two-day process.

167
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,186
We...

168
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:42,314
-pretty much made the beat.
-(beat plays)

169
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:43,815
Recorded it the next day.

and we just started kicking it,

00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:18,478
We were programmed from zero to seven

338
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:21,690
to fit into this thing we call reality,

339
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:25,568
but we’re breaking out of the constructs.

340
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:31,116
We’re not satisfied with the constructs
of current society.

341
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,159
We as artists

342
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:35,120
are like a faucet,

343
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:38,164
and the more of our own dirt that we have,

344
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:40,959
you know, the harder it is,
actually, for people to get

345
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:44,504
a clean message and a clean idea

346
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:47,882
and for us to be used to the maximum

347
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:52,262
of what God would want us to use us for.

348
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,347
I feel...

349
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,982
Well, that’s the end
of those thoughts right there.

350
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:09,571
DOT:
So, when I say, "Kid," y’all say, "Cudi."

351
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:10,947
-Kid.
-AUDIENCE: Cudi!

352
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,490
-Kid.
-Cudi!

353
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:15,326
When I say, "Fool’s," y’all say, "Gold."

354
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:18,413
-Fool’s. Fool’s.
-Gold! Gold!

355
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,373
Yo, yo. Yo, yo.

356
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:22,375
That’s what I’m talking about.

357
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:24,586
What the fuck is up, y’all?

358
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:27,213
I just had that long-ass flight
over here, man.

359
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:30,008
Y’all better show me some love
up in this motherfucker.

360
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:32,343
I got crazy jet lag.

361
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:36,306
It’s like 10:35 New York time,
and I’m rocking with y’all on no sleep.

362
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:37,682
Know what I’m talking about?

363
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:39,434
So I need everybody
to come up to the stage.

364
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:40,602
Show me some love.

365
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,103
I know you got your drink and everything.

366
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:43,563
It’s all good.

367
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,273
We gonna rock out, man.

368
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:47,400
I got my homeboy Dot da Genius with me.

369
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:49,360
-I represent Fool’s Gold.
-(feedback squeals)

370
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:50,987
Oh, man, we got feedback.

371
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,156
That’s how live we are right now.
(chuckles)

372
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:56,075
Yeah, it wasn’t until we met Pat

373
00:17:56,159 --> 00:18:01,122
and he locked in with Emile
and there was some type of movement

374
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:03,500
that we started talking about a mixtape.

375
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:07,128
The mixtape released,
and then we went to Australia.

376
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:09,798
Which was, like, the first tour ever.

377
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:12,383
-Just me and him.

Hello.

380
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:16,721
CUDI:
I just have one note.

381
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:18,723
I just feel like this is a big moment.

382
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:20,600
-Mm-hmm.
-Like, I toured the whole country,

383
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:23,520
and, like, maybe there should be
some text on black

384
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:24,854
where it says...

385
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,405
’Cause BAPE wouldn’t give me
three weeks off...

386
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:41,454
You know?

387
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:42,622
-Kid.
-Cudi!

388
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,374
I know there’s been some,
you know, problems

389
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,459
with pronouncing my name, but it’s "Cudi."

390
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:48,378
You know what I’m saying? It’s Cudi.

391
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,421
-So everybody say, "Cudi."
-Cudi!

392
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:52,799
-Cudi! Cudi!
-Cudi! Cudi!

393
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,759
Yeah, so there’ll be nobody
coming up to me

394
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:56,803
saying "Coodie," then, a’ight?

395
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,555
Then we got that established.

396
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,765
It was crazy.
The first show was literally,

397
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:03,685
like, maybe ten, 15 people.

398
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:06,646
And you could tell they were just drunk
and they were just like,

399
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:08,982
"Oh, you know, it’s entertainment,"
you know?

400
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:12,110
You can tell that
they didn’t know who he was,

401
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:15,738
but they might have heard "Day N Nite,"
which was kind of crazy.

SYLVIA RHONE:
I’ve always looked for

408
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:41,055
the most off-the-wall music
and artists that I can find,

409
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:42,682
because I think that’s

410
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:45,518
where the excitement comes.

411
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:50,356
When I signed Cudi,
it was a very competitive bidding war.

412
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,734
It was night and day I stayed up...

413
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:55,612
(chuckles) to make this deal for a week.

414
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,488
He was the guy who

415
00:19:57,572 --> 00:20:01,910
smashed and mashed culture
and defied genres.

416
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:03,161
Everybody could see

417
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:06,623

He definitely has a keen sense of harmony.

421

I feel like

422
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:49,248
he has his own point of view and...

423
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,087
...maybe he feeds off,
like, a certain energy

424
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,173
and there was an aesthetic
going back and forth

425
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,217
through Pat and Emile

426
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:04,472
and Pat working with Kanye and crossing,

427
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:06,099
and then Kid Cudi put his stuff...

428
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:09,185
It was all in this, like, solar system

429
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,812

432
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:16,609
Didn’t record it.

433
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:20,446
KANYE: When I first heard Cudi,
it felt really new,

434
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:23,282
the combination of him

435
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:28,705
putting the melody with the rap
in a way that

436
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:33,418
I hadn’t really heard that
since, like, Bone Thugs.

437
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,670
PAT:
I would play Kanye

438
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:38,172
early Cudi demos,
like the stuff him and Dot were doing.

439
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:39,841
And then I guess,
after we made the mixtape,

440
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:41,926
he was like,
"Man, I need to be a part of this."

445
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:50,309
He figured it out. He got out there.

446
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:52,020

CUDI:
From there, like, Kanye cosigned me,

474
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:20,108
and then I started working
on 808s & Heartbreak.

475
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:21,734
I started working on Blueprint 3.

476
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,364
And this is all before my debut.

477
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:30,076
So it was like people were waiting.

478
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,496
If I had got caught up in expectations

479
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:36,082
and what people wanted from me,

480
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:40,044
Man on the Moon: The End of Day
would not have sounded how it sounded.

481
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:44,590
Going in, I had this idea, like,
"Yeah, Kanye’s gonna be involved,"

482
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:46,384
and all this and all that.

483
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:49,804
But, like, when it got to it
and I got the deal done

484
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:54,475
and I was working on these songs
with Pat and Emile and Dot,

485
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,436
I was really, like,
"I’m creating a sound here.

486
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,814
I trust my vision."

487
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:01,899
And...

488
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:04,443
I might not need Kanye like that.

489
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:08,906
You know, and I kind of just
put that noise out of my mind

490
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:11,367
and just kind of focused on the art

491
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,036

and what I was trying to tell.

how to get your vision done

is-is an art in itself. (chuckles)

498
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:39,187
And really, it honestly just comes
or it doesn’t.

499
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:43,065
And that’s something
that I struggle with a lot

500
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:44,984
because it just sucks when you’re like,

501
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:47,737
"Let’s get it," and your heart
and your mind is just like,

502

"We don’t really have anything
to say right now.

00:24:49,614 --> 00:24:50,823
So sorry about that."

504
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:54,994
You have to dig that well
and get to that place

505
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:57,246
in order to really see what’s going on.

506
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:00,499

507
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:02,752
some BS, low-key.

508
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:05,254
I never say no. (chuckles)

509
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:08,716
Never tell a artist no
or, "You can’t," or, you know,

510
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,384
"Don’t do that."

511
00:25:10,468 --> 00:25:12,720
They’re artists. They’re supposed
to think outside the box

512
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:16,724
and do things that you think
that you’re not supposed to do.

513
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:19,560
I mean, just making something
is a fucking achievement,

514
00:25:19,644 --> 00:25:21,103
and you shouldn’t, like,

515
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:24,232
say something is wack
just because you don’t like it.

516
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:25,858
You know, like, somebody still

517
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:29,320
sat fucking down and made that shit with
their hands and their, and their head.

518
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:33,115
You really got to be like--
I don’t even know.

519
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:35,368
I was about to say "comfortable," but, uh,

520
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:36,786
that’s definitely not me
or anybody I know.

521
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:38,079
(laughs) You know what I mean?

522
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:40,665
You got to just, like--
you just got to love the shit, man.

523
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:45,962
SHIA LaBEOUF: What makes an artist
is fully investing your heart.

524
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,421
That’s all it takes.

525
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:50,967
And so, if you don’t give a fuck,

526
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,636
then why invest your heart?

527
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,639
I think the best artists all have that...

528
00:25:56,722 --> 00:26:02,270
one, that drive that they feel like
they need to, to be able to survive,

529
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:06,524
but also this confidence in that

530
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:10,111
the people on the other side
need this shit.

531
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:12,488
That, in sharing this with people,

532
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,324
healing can happen
not just for the person making this shit

533
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:17,952
but for the person receiving this shit.

534
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:20,955
And in that connection,
that’s where art is.

535
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:22,540
It’s in that

536
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:25,543
full investment of heart on both sides.

537
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,301
My favorite shit has come from

538
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:35,970
when I know in my heart
I couldn’t have given anything else,

539
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:40,558
when I lose myself wholly and completely
to this other thing.

540
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:42,852
Which really comes through collaboration.

541
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:50,526
It’s really nice to, like,
fail in front of people.

542
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,237
And also feel like,
on the other side of that failure,

543
00:26:53,321 --> 00:26:55,323
these people still fuck with you.

544
00:26:56,741 --> 00:27:01,370
It gives you a confidence level
where you’re not afraid to fail.

545
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:05,374
JEFF:
People can get so hung up on fucking up,

546
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:08,210
and, like, that’s kind of
the main way you learn.

547
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:11,839
And sometimes you can just fuck up

548
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:14,300
into creating something new
and amazing and beautiful.

549
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:18,137
Daring to suck.

550
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,473
(chuckles) Just dare to suck.

551
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,725
DON C:
That new frontier,

552
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:25,436
it takes a lot of courage to go towards,

553
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,772
especially if it hasn’t been done before.

554
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:34,487
We see in a small bubble
how positive energy can inspire others

555
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:37,615
to then effect even a bigger bubble.

556
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:41,327
So let’s just apply that principle
and keep expounding on it

557
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:45,956
until all seven billion people on Earth is

558
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,792
inspired and happy.

559
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,630
SHIA:
You’ll always have some haters, yeah,

560
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:55,883
who’ll be like,
"What’s this weird Wiccan shit?"

561
00:27:55,966 --> 00:28:00,346
If it was just me and somebody said that,
I’d fucking sink into myself.

562
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:02,181
I’d fall apart.

563
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:05,393
But because I got a group of people
holding me up,

564
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:08,562
I can actually have that
no-fucks-to-give mentality.

565
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:11,232
JEFF:
It’s okay to question.

566
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:17,405
It’s okay to explore all angles
of a sound or a thought or an idea.

567
00:28:17,488 --> 00:28:19,573
It radiates positivity.

568
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:27,540
And the belief
that you can accomplish your dreams.

569
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:32,086
You can express yourself,
and your deepest self is great.

570
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:39,468
The scariest, ugliest thing about you...

571
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:42,638

The first thing that was important to me

583
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:25,306
is to make something that...

584
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:29,560
kind of called out
to the broken and the lost.

585
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:33,230
For me to find kids
that felt like how I felt.

586
00:29:33,314 --> 00:29:36,358

"Soundtrack 2 My Life" was like
my introduction to the world.

591
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:08,182
Like, kind of like my...
my mission statement.

592
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:12,186
It was really important for me
to be as honest as possible.

593
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:13,771
Moments where I say, like,

594
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:15,773
"I’m probably this close
to go and trying some coke."

595
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:18,609
Like, that was a real...

596
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:20,361
feeling.

597
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:22,780
I was a little worried about
what my mom may think

598
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:26,700
and my family and friends,

599
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:28,869
but, uh, ultimately,

600
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:33,082
it was about being honest
and just being a true artist.

601
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:35,543
EMILE:
The way I knew how to make music

602
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:40,506
until I met Cudi was to sit
in my studio alone and make beats,

603
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:44,927
come up with a beat,
and then try to go pitch it.

604
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:49,265
I remember playing him the beats
that I already had, and he just didn’t...

605
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:51,767
it wasn’t really connecting
with him, you know?

606
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,228
And it wasn’t until
I started playing records

607
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:57,856
and playing synth sounds and this
that he started going.

608
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,567
It was instantaneous.

609
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:03,654
The second I started playing fresh stuff
that was creating stuff on the spot,

610
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:06,615
that’s when the wheels started turning
and he would just start writing.

611
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:07,866
You know, if I...

612
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,952
(playing chords)

613
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,041
Like, I’d be playing
these kind of chords--

614
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:19,295
like, really simple things--
’cause I just didn’t have

615
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:22,047
the wherewithal to, like,
do anything more complex,

616
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:23,674
and he would just... I would do that,

617
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:26,510
and he would put the mic on,
and he would go in the booth.

618
00:31:26,594 --> 00:31:28,846
And I’m like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa,
I got to, like, put this...

619
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:31,056
I got to put this on tempo
and put it in the computer."

620
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,601
And he just didn’t want to hear that.
He was ready to go.

621
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:37,938
So, as... as kind of basic
as that was that I just played,

622
00:31:38,022 --> 00:31:41,025
he would then take it
and do something fresh with it.

623
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:43,110
Anything I come up with

624
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:45,195
that I would maybe second-guess
if I was just alone--

625
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,406
I would think, like, you know,
"Who am I gonna play..."--

626
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:49,325
like, he would get inspired by it

627
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,327
and come up with something cool
that would then inspire me,

628
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,661
and we would go back and forth.

629
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:55,956
So it was like-- completely changed

630
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,709
the way I thought about music,
the way my process happened,

631
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:00,836
the sounds that I was looking for.

632
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:06,925
This takes you from being a beat maker
to being a songwriter.

633
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:10,971
So we’d just kind of be listening...

634
00:32:11,055 --> 00:32:13,515
we’d, like, flip through records...

635
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,601
("Birds" by Menahan Street Band playing)

636
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:17,895
And, um... I remember
on this one he heard, like...

637
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:20,981
("The Contender"
by Menahan Street Band playing)

638
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:23,984
Let’s see.

639
00:32:25,027 --> 00:32:26,403
Is this the right record?

640
00:32:26,487 --> 00:32:28,322
("The Traitor"
by Menahan Street Band playing)

641
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:29,657
That sounds like it.

642
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,325
And we just kind of like...

643
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:34,411
(synth beat plays along
with "The Traitor")

644
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:40,167
I think we were, like, probably
playing video games or something

645
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,504
and that came on in the background,
and he was just like, "What is that?"

646
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:45,214
I’m like,
"Ah, it’s, like, my friends’ thing."

647
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,633
And he’s like, you know,
"Loop it up and maybe pitch it."

648
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:49,426
So we, like, pitched it.

649
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,514
Pitched it way down, something like...

650
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:55,557
(plays melody with low pitch)

651
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:03,315
So I’d have something like that,

652
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:07,861
and by the time it took me to just do that
and then put it into the computer

653
00:33:07,945 --> 00:33:11,073
and just do a loop,
he’s got the verse written.

654
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,033
So that would kind of be the process.

655
00:33:13,117 --> 00:33:16,203
"Solo Dolo" was just
so unorthodox and weird.

656
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:17,705
It’s just got that-that loop.

657
00:33:17,788 --> 00:33:19,123
(loop from "The Traitor"
continues playing)

658
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:20,708
That... (humming melody)

659
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:25,337
It’s just, like, hypnotizing.

660
00:33:25,421 --> 00:33:27,089
And eerie.

661
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:29,299
It’s a little scary a little bit.

662
00:33:29,383 --> 00:33:34,263
And I-I love how I sound
on that record, you know?

663
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:37,766
Like, I’m really... I’m really proud
of the performance.

664
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,352

And it’s like, yeah, but "Day N Nite"

674
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:16,138
wasn’t "Day N Nite"
until it became "Day N Nite."

675
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,098
And they were pushing us to, you know,

676
00:34:18,182 --> 00:34:20,476
make a radio song
or make something catchy.

677
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:23,228
But, you know, Cudi wasn’t hearing...
he wasn’t trying to hear none of that.

678
00:34:23,312 --> 00:34:26,023
And I was like,
"No, you have to listen to me.

679
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:27,357
You have to listen."

680
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:29,359
Like, I was in that office
having a tantrum.

681
00:34:29,443 --> 00:34:30,569
I was like, "No.

682
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:32,821
"This is the next single.

683
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:35,491
You have to believe me. Trust me."

684
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,785
Our next guest is a, uh, popular rapper

685
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:40,996
whose forthcoming CD,
uh, right here is entitled...

686
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,831
ALL:
Man on the Moon: The End of the Day.

687
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:45,083

NOAH CALLAHAN-BEVER:
...is arguably

694
00:35:04,645 --> 00:35:07,189
one of the most influential albums
in the last

695
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:08,482
20 years.

696
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:12,945
SCHOOLBOY Q:
Where I come from, we don’t...

697
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:14,905
we don’t even try to touch those feelings

698
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:18,075
and emotions, like being,
like, uh, depressed or sad.

699
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:20,077
And if you are depressed,
you don’t mention it.

700
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,620
You keep that in.

701
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:23,288
You-you fight through it, nigga.
Suck it up.

702
00:35:23,372 --> 00:35:24,957
Like, you know what I mean?

703
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,167
No crying. Chin up, chest out.

704
00:35:27,251 --> 00:35:28,877
NOAH:
He pulled back the layers

705
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:31,129
to show you some universal truths.

706
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:33,006
That created a depth of connection

707
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:36,343
that very, very few artists
are able to create.

708
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:38,929
SCHOOLBOY Q: Songs like
"Pursuit of Happiness" and shit.

709
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:42,099
You know, that’s, like, basically saying,
"Hey, nigga, you depressed.

710
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:43,559
"You can’t hide it.

711
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,894
"You trying to act like
you don’t want to hear the song.

712
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:47,688
"You’re constantly listening to it

713
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:49,898
while trying to act like
you’re not listening to it."

714
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:51,358
That was like a caver for me.

715
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:53,527
Like, all that "chin up, chest out" shit
was a real caver

716
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:56,905
when that "Pursuit of Happiness"
really hits you.

717
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:58,866
CUDI:
It’s a really dark song.

718
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:00,784
Probably one of the darkest on the album.

719
00:36:00,868 --> 00:36:02,286
That’s why it’s labeled "Nightmare."

720
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:04,162
I think that got lost on some people.

721
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:08,083
When we did the remix and stuff like that,
it became, like, something else.

722
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,626
So it bothered me at first.

723
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,253
I was like, "Oh, they missed the point.

724
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:12,963
"This is not supposed to be celebrated.

725
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:14,506
I’m talking about drinking and driving."

726
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,967
Like, I’m very reckless on the song.

727
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:20,304
I’m saying, "I’m-a do just what I want."
Saying, "Fuck that."

728
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:23,223
Like, it’s... it’s very rebellious.

729
00:36:23,307 --> 00:36:26,184
But now, like, I-I don’t really...

730
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:28,061
I don’t really trip about that.

731
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:31,732
Like, I love the reaction to "Pursuit"
every time I do it at the shows.

732
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:33,692
Like, I got to perform that song.
You know?

733
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:36,361
Like, I’ll be performing
that song forever.

734
00:36:36,445 --> 00:36:39,364
♪ Hey, hey, hey... ♪

735
00:36:39,448 --> 00:36:40,657
ALL:
Man on the Moon.

736
00:36:40,741 --> 00:36:43,619
♪ Uh, little homey... ♪

737
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:45,537
He’s soulful, and he’s funny,

738
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:47,247
-and he’s so sensitive.
-You say what, now?

739
00:36:47,331 --> 00:36:48,498
-JEFF: But those melodies.
-ALL: Melodies.

740
00:36:48,582 --> 00:36:50,542
No one else has those melodies.

741
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:52,044
Like on, uh, "Heart of a Lion" and...

742
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:53,921
♪ No, no, no, no, no ♪

743
00:36:54,004 --> 00:36:55,589
-♪ Yeah. ♪
-And all that stuff.

744
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:57,633
You feel like, "Aw, if I had a beat, man,

745
00:36:57,716 --> 00:37:00,636
I could come up with that shit,"
you know, but you can’t.

746
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,346
SCHOOLBOY Q:
It was just a different vibe,

747
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:04,306
and it was no shit I never heard before.

748
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:05,474
Dude, I was just like,

749
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:07,392
"What the fuck am I listening to?"

750
00:37:07,476 --> 00:37:08,977
Right, I’m like... I didn’t get it.

751
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:11,021
Like, "Why do I like this shit?" Like...

752
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:12,981
I kept playing this shit.

753
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:15,067
Kept, kept playing this shit.

754
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:18,737
And then I got it.
I’m like, "This shit is just hard."

755
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,572
JADEN SMITH:
When I was younger, I would just always

756
00:37:20,656 --> 00:37:23,200
hang out with my older brother,
and my older brother

757
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:24,952
was just obsessed with listening
to Cudi, you know...

758
00:37:25,035 --> 00:37:26,578
-"Pursuit of Happiness."
-"Cudi Zone." -"Heart of a Lion."

759
00:37:26,662 --> 00:37:28,789
...and he would just
put it on loop, like, all day,

760
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:30,624
so, like, I didn’t even know
who we were listening to

761
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:32,209
for the longest time,

762
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:35,170
and then it just kind of
became ingrained into me.

763
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:38,382
It’s showing people all over the world
that they can do whatever they want,

764
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:40,258
especially people of color
who are just like,

765
00:37:40,342 --> 00:37:43,095
"Oh, I can’t do this,"
or, "This is not my thing."

766
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:45,097
It’s like, "No, this can be your thing."

767
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,724
Whatever your thing is, you can do that.

768
00:37:47,808 --> 00:37:51,895
That opened up
a whole new frontier of just kids

769
00:37:51,979 --> 00:37:54,564
that are now today the ones that are

770
00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:57,317
-the forerunners of culture.
-I know.

771
00:37:57,401 --> 00:37:59,152
When I heard Man on the Moon,
that was the first time

772
00:37:59,236 --> 00:38:01,488
I heard an album, like, so...

773
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:02,614
ALL:
...unique.

774
00:38:02,698 --> 00:38:04,074
He just was the wizard.

775
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:07,077
Bridging techno and rap, I mean,
just all these things, you know, like,

776
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,038
that weren’t necessarily being done.

777
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:11,999
Wizard.

778
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:15,168
You know, you bring in something
from a completely different world

779
00:38:15,252 --> 00:38:18,088
into your world, and it’s not normal,

780
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:21,883
but it works, and people like,
"Okay, well, now we can do that."

781
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:24,511
I don’t know.

782
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:28,056
That nigga just was a different...
he was a weird, ill nigga.

783
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,933
(chuckling):
Like...

784
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:33,270
he was a ill nigga, man, you know?

785
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:34,855
Honestly, "Sky Might Fall."

786
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:36,898
Like, I can’t lie. I can’t lie.

787
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:38,358

00:38:39,693 --> 00:38:44,698

-DON C: When it came out...
-BOTH: Man on the Moon.

792
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:55,417
DON C:
...album connected with a audience of kids

793
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,170
that had never had a artist
connect with them.

794
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:01,173
Ye started the movement
with College Dropout.

795
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:04,634
Man on the Moon picked it up,
and then it was a big momentum

796
00:39:04,718 --> 00:39:07,888
of that snowball effect
that really completely affected culture.

797
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:10,390
Before then, people only represented,

798
00:39:10,474 --> 00:39:12,517
like, "I’m the cool guy,"
or, "I’m the thug,"

799
00:39:12,601 --> 00:39:14,269
or, "I’m the gangster."

800
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,938
But it was never, like, "I’m a introvert.

801
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:19,274
I’m hurt over these things
that have happened in my life."

802
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:22,402
These are feelings we all go through,
but nobody wants to talk about it.

803
00:39:22,486 --> 00:39:25,697
Now we all feel comfortable
because of that.

804
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:29,451
A$AP ROCKY: He was changing
the game by being his own protégé

805
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:33,580
and musing himself
and letting Kanye muse him and...

806
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:35,499
and show people, like,
yo, you can be weird.

807
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:37,209
You can be yourself.

808
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:38,585
You can be from Cleveland.

809
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:40,212
You can be from wherever.

810
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:41,838
TIMOTHÉE CHALAMET:
There was that relatability to it.

811
00:39:41,922 --> 00:39:43,465
There was that immediacy to it.

812
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,175
And this was the music

813
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:49,805
I was hearing that I felt like,
"Whoa, he’s speaking to my soul."

814
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:51,598
I remember having to take pauses
from listening to it

815
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:53,225
’cause I loved it and it was therapeutic,

816
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:55,060
and yet at the same time,
I don’t know what that...

817
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:56,895
I’m sure a scientist could speak to it
better than I could.

818
00:39:56,978 --> 00:40:00,190
DR. CANDICE NORCOTT:
We don’t all have language about emotions,

819
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:02,317
so to be able to see a piece of art

820
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,363
and have that pull from you
an authentic emotion is so powerful.

821
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:11,118
Music that is emotional or "sad"
helps you but also, like,

822
00:40:11,201 --> 00:40:13,245
brings it on even more in some way.

823
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:15,497
And I think that’s really important.

824
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,040

NOAH:
Hip-hop had done an incredible job

830
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:33,640
of articulating a lot of things

831
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:36,101
about the environments that these artists

832
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:39,896
were coming up in
and did a lot less talking about

833
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:42,566
what was going on
inside of those artists’ heads.

834
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:45,610
Cudi had no reservations

835
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:50,448
about delving into
his most private, dark thoughts.

836
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:53,368
JOE LA PUMA:
You’ll see it in today’s artists.

837
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,537
They don’t talk about Cudi,

838
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,455
"Oh, I love his music.
He’s so dope. He dress great."

839
00:40:57,539 --> 00:40:59,207
You know what they say?

840
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:01,251
Kid Cudi, man, Kid Cudi’s,
like, really, like,

841
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:05,088
one of the main dudes I kind of, like,
looked at or listened to all the time.

842
00:41:05,172 --> 00:41:06,131
BOTH:
He saved my life.

843
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:07,591
He saved me from doing,

844
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:10,969
like, random bad things to myself,
kept me, like, focused.

845
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:13,054
JOE:
You hear that numerous times

846
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:14,931
when people talk about Cudi.

847
00:41:15,015 --> 00:41:16,183
You hear that when

848
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:17,767
his fans talk about Cudi.

849
00:41:17,851 --> 00:41:19,936
And you also hear it from

850
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,813
some of the biggest people

851
00:41:21,897 --> 00:41:24,524
-in pop culture right now a decade later.
-Pop culture.

852
00:41:24,608 --> 00:41:26,818
TRAVIS SCOTT:
I feel like he really dialed in on, like,

853
00:41:26,902 --> 00:41:30,113
the youth and really dialed in
on, like, um, inspiration,

854
00:41:30,197 --> 00:41:31,656
like, how to inspire you.

855
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:34,868
Like, his words was, like,
very selected on, like, what to do.

856
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:36,578
I-I feel like he always made
the soundtrack

857
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:37,871
-to, like, my life.
-Soundtrack to my life.

858
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:39,039
Or anybody’s life who was,

859
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:40,373
like, going through the same thing.

860
00:41:40,457 --> 00:41:43,335
If you’re a big Cudi fan, like,
you know exactly what I’m saying.

861
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:45,545
When I think about albums
that have colored my life

862
00:41:45,629 --> 00:41:49,299
or narrated my come-up,
this is the biggest one.

863
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:53,136
This is the biggest one for my maturation
from, like, being a little teenager

864
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,222
to, like, stepping into the real world.

865
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:58,141
He spit his truth in a way
that seemed accessible,

866
00:41:58,225 --> 00:41:59,726
-and he was vulnerable.
-DOT: Vulnerable.

867
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:01,937
And was talking about things like,

868
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,981
"Nobody knows, but I’m-I’m feeling a lot."

869
00:42:05,065 --> 00:42:08,109
He gave me, like, a waiver to be
open to my emotions, you know?

870
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:09,778
The album really starts there.

871
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:11,404
TIMOTHÉE:
And isn’t it ironic that

872
00:42:11,488 --> 00:42:15,408
in a genre that is about impenetrability,

873
00:42:15,492 --> 00:42:18,703
bravado in the face of pain,

874
00:42:18,787 --> 00:42:21,790
that the one that would’ve transcended

875
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:27,212
that confrontation of ego
and of, like, competition

876
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:32,884
would be the one that was the least about
how big his chain was

877
00:42:32,968 --> 00:42:36,012
or, you know, how hard his beats slapped

878
00:42:36,096 --> 00:42:39,474
but was the guy that was, like,
"Hey, I’m a human,

879
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,601
"and this is what I go through,

880
00:42:41,685 --> 00:42:46,147
and love it or hate it,
like, this is my reality."

881
00:42:55,115 --> 00:42:57,993
LIL YACHTY: You know, I went to college,
and I had this red hair,

882
00:42:58,076 --> 00:43:02,122
and, man, I’d walk in the cafeteria
or when I walked to class, yo, I just...

883
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:06,543
I saw people looking at me,
laughing at me and made jokes.

884
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:09,337
I mean, I was hurt, I felt it,
I could feel the eyes,

885
00:43:09,421 --> 00:43:11,464
but it was this thing I had on my head.

886
00:43:11,548 --> 00:43:13,675
I always used to know, like,
I had to embrace myself.

887
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:15,844
With Cudi-- and I would never
say this to his face.

888
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,554
That’d be kind of weird.

889
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:23,268
But definitely appreciate him
for being him so that I could be me.

890
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:24,853
’Cause, you know, times get hard,

891
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:28,064
for anyone at any time,
but you just always have to realize

892
00:43:28,148 --> 00:43:33,486
that there’s more to life
than that very moment.

893
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:36,114
That thought can get clouded,

894
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:38,616
you know, because sometimes
it’s just, in the moment,

895
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:42,704
things get so tough
that it’s hard to even imagine

896
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:45,498
the fact that-that things could be
better somewhere else.

897
00:43:45,582 --> 00:43:47,917
I don’t know, it was just something
I always had in mind.

898
00:43:48,001 --> 00:43:50,045
I always knew
there was more to life than this.

899
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:54,215
Than this school,
than this dorm and these kids.

900
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:57,927
Just knew there was more,
and I knew I was gonna achieve it.

00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:30,543
I never worried about the music part.

911
00:44:30,627 --> 00:44:33,963
The sadness, I only worried about him.

912
00:44:34,047 --> 00:44:37,384
He was a guy that stayed to himself a lot.

913
00:44:37,467 --> 00:44:41,137
In the beginning,
it was a hard adjustment for him to make.

914
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:46,518
There’s the saying, right?
"Everywhere you go, there you are."

915
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:52,148
And when you get more money,
you think that things will get better,

916
00:44:52,232 --> 00:44:54,442
things will get easier.

917
00:44:54,526 --> 00:44:57,070
But when you have lots of eyes on you,

918
00:44:57,153 --> 00:44:59,948
it can magnify feelings
of negative self-perception,

919
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,242
and that can be
particularly vulnerable and hurtful.

920
00:45:05,495 --> 00:45:08,456
There are people who say, you know,
"That song saved my life."

921
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:10,834
And that’s got to feel extremely scary.

922
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:15,672
I have these people’s lives in my hand,
but I’m struggling here, too.

923
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:17,757
What’s my responsibility?

924
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:22,303
The pressure in that can be overwhelming.

925
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:33,273
CUDI:
I just really found it hard to be happy.

926
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:35,275
(audience cheering)

927
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:37,402
I’m like, "Okay, I’m successful."

928
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:42,449
Like, I accomplished what I came
to New York City to accomplish.

929
00:45:42,532 --> 00:45:45,243
But, um...

930
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:47,454
I was miserable, man.

931
00:45:47,537 --> 00:45:52,625
I just couldn’t help but feel
like Richie Rich or somebody.

932
00:45:52,709 --> 00:45:55,587
Like, you know, I had security
with me everywhere I went

933
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:57,630
and, like, people looking out for me.

934
00:45:58,882 --> 00:46:02,135
There would be some nights
where I’d be at the club

935
00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:06,431
and I would just run out the club

936
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:09,058
and run for blocks.

937
00:46:09,142 --> 00:46:13,271
And I would hop in a yellow cab,
trying to get away from my security.

938
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:15,148
And my security would get in a cab

939
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:17,984
and follow me all the way home
and be right there.

940
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:20,069
I could never lose his ass.

941
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:25,325
I just had a hard time
dealing with the adjustments

942
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:28,411
from being this-this guy,

943
00:46:28,495 --> 00:46:32,081
from being Scott, to being Kid Cudi.

♪ ♪

945
00:46:55,647 --> 00:46:58,983
It was a little bit of a nightmare for me

946
00:46:59,067 --> 00:47:03,071
because I wasn’t right with myself.

947
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:11,496
When I would do shows,
I didn’t feel anything.

948
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:18,378
I think I was scared
and intimidated by the stage.

949
00:47:20,922 --> 00:47:22,966
Like, if you look at
some of my early performances,

950
00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:24,676
I’m not smiling.

951
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:29,180
I just want to be around good people.

952
00:47:29,264 --> 00:47:31,307
I want to look them in the eyes
and see their soul

953
00:47:31,391 --> 00:47:34,978
and know that they’re real people
and they’re shooting me straight.

954
00:47:35,061 --> 00:47:37,730
I didn’t get that a lot.

955
00:47:37,814 --> 00:47:39,524
I was just like,
"Man, these people might...

956
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:41,526
"I-I don’t know if they like me for me

957
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:45,071
or if they like me
’cause of my cosign with Kanye."

958
00:47:45,154 --> 00:47:47,031
Or maybe they just like "Day N Nite"

959
00:47:47,115 --> 00:47:49,075
and they don’t even know
about the other music.

960
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:53,454
Like, I don’t... I didn’t
really know what that was,

961
00:47:53,538 --> 00:47:58,042
why people were into me as a artist.

962
00:48:01,546 --> 00:48:04,465
And I was just like,
"Well, maybe this isn’t for me."

963
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:10,430
There was a lot of good moments
recording the album.

964
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:15,977
But after it was done, it was, like...

965
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:19,606
promoting it,
and people would ask me questions,

966
00:48:19,689 --> 00:48:23,985
personal questions
that I wasn’t ready to answer.

967
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:26,362
For some reason-- and this is the truth--

968
00:48:26,446 --> 00:48:32,118
I never thought that being so honest
would, in turn, have people wanting

969
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:34,829
to ask me so many personal questions.

970
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,290
People would be like,
"Oh, you lost your dad at 11 years old.

971
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:39,459
What was that like?"

972
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:42,295
These are questions
that I’ve never been asked before.

973
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:44,922
This is, like, stuff that
I’ve never even thought about.

974
00:48:45,006 --> 00:48:48,426
When my father died,
I camouflaged all my feelings.

975
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:50,720
I-I tucked that shit away.

976
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:53,222
I pretended like
that shit didn’t even happen.

977
00:48:53,306 --> 00:48:55,725
And I would do interviews
with sunglasses on,

978
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:57,727
and I’d be on cocaine,
and I’d just be, like,

979
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:00,271
sitting there
and answering these questions.

980
00:49:00,355 --> 00:49:03,066
Because that’s the only way
I could talk about stuff like that.

981
00:49:07,487 --> 00:49:10,156
I would never leave my house.

982
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:12,784
I wouldn’t go out and do anything.

983
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:19,916
But when I did cocaine,
I could be out in the street.

984
00:49:22,335 --> 00:49:24,462
I’d be the mayor.

985
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:26,130
I’d be running out in the street.

986
00:49:26,214 --> 00:49:28,132
People were seeing me signing autographs.

987
00:49:28,216 --> 00:49:30,718
I’m taking pictures.
I’m like, "Yo, what’s good?"

988
00:49:32,387 --> 00:49:35,807
It gave me confidence
to step out the house.

989
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:39,894
To be normal.

990
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:44,482
ROBERT:
So, what was the approach

991
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:46,401
of, uh, Man on the Moon II?

992
00:49:50,697 --> 00:49:53,408
(laughs)

993
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:56,119
Ah, man.

994
00:49:56,202 --> 00:49:57,578
(sucks teeth)

995
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,959
I don’t want to talk about
Man on the Moon II.

996
00:50:03,042 --> 00:50:05,294
I don’t really want to get--
D-Do you want to go to Man on the...

997
00:50:05,378 --> 00:50:07,380
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

998
00:50:09,632 --> 00:50:12,135
You know, early on, it was fine.

999
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:17,682
It wasn’t till after, uh,
everything became su-successful

1000
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:20,935
that everything kind of, like, got dark.

1001
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,479
Oh, you mean the ending?

1002
00:50:23,563 --> 00:50:25,898
-Yeah, it’s too...
-(electronic tone plays)

1003
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:31,279
(beat plays briefly)

1004
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:34,282

After Man on the Moon was finished,

1009
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:45,042
I went right back to the studio.

1010
00:50:45,126 --> 00:50:46,627
EMILE:
You know, we were like brothers.

1011
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:50,423
We were all in the studio constantly,
and, like, you know, you have that thing

1012
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:54,510
of, like, we shared hotel rooms
and going and doing his first shows

1013
00:50:54,594 --> 00:50:56,512
for 30 people in Jersey somewhere and...

1014
00:50:56,596 --> 00:50:59,974
You know, we went through
all that, and, uh,

1015
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:03,060
you know, the dynamic shifts naturally.
It just has to.

1016

He definitely was going through things.

1017
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:10,151
You could tell that
he just wasn’t, like, feeling it.

1018
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:13,905
I just remember
it going from us doing a show,

1019
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:15,281
doing an after-party.

(lively chatter)

1021
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:20,870
Like, usually having a lot
going on all the time,

1022
00:51:20,953 --> 00:51:23,873
and then he just completely
deaded all that.

1023
00:51:23,956 --> 00:51:26,918
He would have moments like this
before the first album.

1024
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:29,670
You know, like, he would be
dealing with something.

1025
00:51:29,754 --> 00:51:32,965
He’ll just lock himself in a room
in the house by himself.

1026
00:51:33,049 --> 00:51:36,552

with Cudi and Ye, I was...

1030

1037
00:52:04,205 --> 00:52:06,374

1038

You don’t want to stop it,
but what do you do?

1043
00:52:16,592 --> 00:52:18,219
He didn’t seem happy at all,

1044
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:20,012
and he didn’t seem to be
looking forward to anything.

1045
00:52:20,096 --> 00:52:25,643

this idea that he wasn’t gonna live.

1143
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:23,732
He goes, "This is bullshit,"

the script out his hand

1147

It was really smooth how I did it

1150
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:42,251
’cause he took it out,
and then right when he pulled it out,

1151
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:43,794
I was like, "No, no, no, no."

1152
00:57:43,878 --> 00:57:45,379
And he was pissed.

1153
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:48,799
He had given me a passport
to his life story.

1154
00:57:48,883 --> 00:57:51,427
He had given me access to everything.
I’m talking to his mother.

1155
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:53,137
And I had put it in the pages.

1156
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,139
And there was shit in the pages
that he just...

1157
00:57:55,222 --> 00:57:57,099
we had never double-checked
with each other,

1158
00:57:57,183 --> 00:57:59,310
and there were certain things
he didn’t want to talk about.

1159
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:04,732
He’s so aware of how he’s being perceived
that he wants to shape it

1160
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:07,067
to such a degree
that it doesn’t allow him to be free.

1161
00:58:07,151 --> 00:58:09,528
Which is why we’ve had contention,
me and him.

1162
00:58:09,612 --> 00:58:12,448
It’s ’cause I am a digger
and I’m curious as fuck,

1163
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:14,909
and I’ll go there with him
and he’ll shut it down.

1164
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:16,994
I didn’t understand that
for years, you know?

1165
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:19,205
Um, and we got better,
and-and then we fell out,

1166
00:58:19,288 --> 00:58:20,873

00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:03,916
bought me a guitar one year,

"Why’d you buy me that?"

1180

you could get into the guitar."

Even if it was a weird thing,

don’t really want to fuck with someone
who doesn’t have their shit together.

1260

1261

and that was a big deal for me.

1262
01:03:25,052 --> 01:03:29,097
The person that believed in me
and signed me, I lost her.

1263
01:03:30,432 --> 01:03:35,229
My career would have been different
if I had Sylvia Rhone.

1264
01:03:36,271 --> 01:03:40,609
’Cause Sylvia believed in me
like nobody else in the industry.

01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:43,904
No matter how weird
or how strange the music would be,

1266
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:47,157
she would be totally all in
with what I wanted to do.

1267
01:03:47,241 --> 01:03:50,827
And it’s tough ’cause
these labels are cutthroat.

1268
01:03:52,371 --> 01:03:54,540
I know they support me,
but it’s still like,

1269
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:56,625
"Where’s the radio single?"

1270
01:03:58,585 --> 01:04:00,587

and get flayed for it

1275
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:17,854

was another Man on the Moon.

He’s got a bunch of Man on the Moons
sitting in a backpack.

1277
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:23,193
His thing is he hates repeating himself.

1278
01:04:23,277 --> 01:04:26,321
He feels passé
or like he’s not pushing it.

1279
01:04:27,322 --> 01:04:32,160
He winds up sabotaging himself
from, like, a certain kind of pop success

1280
01:04:32,244 --> 01:04:35,163
because he’s so dissatisfied
with the rest of life.

1281
01:04:35,247 --> 01:04:38,458
Out of that dissatisfaction,
you wind up with incredible art

1282

I want people to play my record

1294

the label is telling them to play it.

01:17:01,451 --> 01:17:03,703
and trying to cover it up
in some sort of way.

1502
01:17:05,246 --> 01:17:07,915
We’re gonna come together in our flaws,

1503
01:17:07,999 --> 01:17:13,087
in our insecurities,
in our joy, in our happiness,

1504
01:17:13,171 --> 01:17:17,967
and accept it all
as beautiful and as natural.

1505
01:17:18,051 --> 01:17:22,722
That’s what’s gonna break down those walls
and make everyone be like,

1506
01:17:22,805 --> 01:17:25,725
"Nah, I understand you
and your pain and your joy.

1507
01:17:25,808 --> 01:17:27,810
We’re gonna be okay."

1508
01:17:29,896 --> 01:17:31,898
WOMAN:
I’m a little nervous, okay?

1509
01:17:34,567 --> 01:17:37,445
Every time I talk about him,
I get a little emotional.

1510
01:17:37,528 --> 01:17:39,530
Always been there for me.

1511
01:17:39,614 --> 01:17:41,366

1512
01:17:41,449 --> 01:17:43,034

WOMAN 2: There was always
someone who related to me.

1517
01:17:53,628 --> 01:17:54,879
Yeah, I knew that

1518
01:17:54,962 --> 01:17:57,173
somebody out there
sort of knew how I felt.

1519
01:17:57,256 --> 01:17:59,509
And that was Cudi to me.

1520
01:18:01,636 --> 01:18:04,180
MAN:
To me, he means like a brother to me.

1521
01:18:04,263 --> 01:18:05,765
Somebody I look up to.

1522
01:18:05,848 --> 01:18:11,521
Man on the Moon,
that was like the start of my life.

1523
01:18:11,604 --> 01:18:15,149
WOMAN 3:
He just... he opened up a new side of me

1524
01:18:15,233 --> 01:18:18,694
to where I could just
totally understand that I wasn’t alone.

1525
01:18:19,821 --> 01:18:22,448
WOMAN 4:
He’s helped me and motivated me

1526
01:18:22,532 --> 01:18:25,493
through a lot of down times in my life,

1527
01:18:25,576 --> 01:18:28,037
and I feel like he’s helped me
as an artist grow

1528
01:18:28,121 --> 01:18:29,580
and be more vulnerable myself

1529
01:18:29,664 --> 01:18:32,708
and letting people around me
know that, like,

1530
01:18:32,792 --> 01:18:36,963
it’s okay to feel the way you do
and it’s okay to be sad.

1531
01:18:37,046 --> 01:18:39,632
SHIA: You know,
I have huge chunks of my 20s, like,

1532
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:43,136
where I held this, like...
this bullshit exterior.

1533
01:18:43,219 --> 01:18:46,139
’Cause I come from fucking
Disney Channel into Spielberg,

1534
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:48,224
where it was like,
"You better smile a lot."

1535
01:18:48,307 --> 01:18:51,352
He had that, and I always
identified with that in him--

1536
01:18:51,436 --> 01:18:54,480
the fact that he smiles
as a way of surviving.

1537
01:18:54,564 --> 01:18:59,318
And so I would bump his album nonstop
all through that whole chapter of my life

1538
01:18:59,402 --> 01:19:01,487
because we shared sensibilities.

1539
01:19:01,571 --> 01:19:05,032
So he unlocked this certain kind
of vulnerability which felt

1540
01:19:05,116 --> 01:19:07,618
more authentic to who I was.

1541
01:19:07,702 --> 01:19:10,705
It’s always been, like...
like, that journey, like--

1542
01:19:10,788 --> 01:19:13,458
he was always meant to be
my best friend. Yeah.

1543
01:19:13,541 --> 01:19:15,460
And he may not speak about it
the same way,

1544
01:19:15,543 --> 01:19:17,462
but I have no shame in saying that.

1545
01:19:17,545 --> 01:19:19,505
He... the dude has my heart.

1546
01:19:19,589 --> 01:19:22,550
Not just because of his music
but because of the fabric of him.

1547
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:27,763
This dude means so much to me, bro.

1548
01:19:27,847 --> 01:19:29,849
He’s really, like...

1549
01:19:32,059 --> 01:19:33,936
...integral to my life.

1550
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:36,481
Not just the music
but just as a person, like,

1551
01:19:36,564 --> 01:19:40,443
just a big, big chunk of my... my life.

1552
01:19:40,526 --> 01:19:42,278
(chuckles):
God.

1553
01:19:42,361 --> 01:19:44,947
But the music, too. Yeah, the music, too.

1554

1555

...if I look back...

1556
01:19:59,837 --> 01:20:02,423
...is probably him going to rehab.

1557
01:20:04,258 --> 01:20:06,886

1558
01:20:06,969 --> 01:20:10,223
lost... lost him, you know what I mean?

1559
01:20:10,306 --> 01:20:12,808
It wasn’t like a...

1560
01:20:12,892 --> 01:20:17,230
a moment of happiness at all,

1561
01:20:17,313 --> 01:20:22,485
but looking back, it was like,
man, I’m so glad that...

1562
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:25,821
...he went when he did

1563
01:20:25,905 --> 01:20:28,866
and not a... not a minute later.

1564
01:20:32,745 --> 01:20:35,414
CUDI:
I wasn’t the best me I could be.

1565
01:20:38,751 --> 01:20:42,922
We sometimes have that
in our lives, you know?

1566
01:20:43,005 --> 01:20:45,424
And these are things
that I touched on in rehab.

1567
01:20:45,508 --> 01:20:48,386
I talked about
could’ve did this way better,

1568
01:20:48,469 --> 01:20:50,221
I could’ve been there,

1569
01:20:50,304 --> 01:20:53,224
or I could’ve understood,
I could’ve not been afraid.

1570
01:20:54,475 --> 01:20:57,728
I realize that a lot
of what I was dealing with

1571
01:20:57,812 --> 01:21:00,064
was because I was always working.

1572
01:21:01,107 --> 01:21:06,779
And I wasn’t giving myself the time
to live my life.

1573
01:21:06,862 --> 01:21:08,447
And I told myself

1574
01:21:08,531 --> 01:21:13,536
that I was going to pace myself
with this shit.

1575
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:16,414
I’m in such a happier place, and I feel

1576
01:21:16,497 --> 01:21:19,625
like I can talk about certain things,

1577
01:21:19,709 --> 01:21:22,670
and I’ve come to terms with my bullshit.

1578
01:21:22,753 --> 01:21:24,589
I faced my bullshit.

1579
01:21:26,299 --> 01:21:28,884
I know where I went wrong.

1580
01:21:28,968 --> 01:21:30,970
There’s no confusion about it.

1581
01:21:32,263 --> 01:21:34,348
So now I can talk about it.

1582
01:21:36,142 --> 01:21:39,729

DR. NORCOTT:
Feeling lost is okay.

1602
01:22:50,549 --> 01:22:52,551
Everybody should feel lost.

1603
01:22:52,635 --> 01:22:55,846
No one has our purpose figured out.

1604
01:22:55,930 --> 01:23:01,727
And you can use the time of feeling lost
and reframe it to say you’re exploring.

1605
01:23:01,811 --> 01:23:04,980
A lot of healing is about
changing your perception,

1606
01:23:05,064 --> 01:23:07,358
and a lot of the work
towards recovery is about

1607
01:23:07,441 --> 01:23:09,735
changing your perception
of what you’re experiencing

1608
01:23:09,819 --> 01:23:13,864
and knowing that you can
feel lost with other people.

1609

(cheering)

1679
01:27:07,431 --> 01:27:10,309
I recognized early on that

1680
01:27:10,392 --> 01:27:15,064
to be able to do music
was such a special thing,

1681
01:27:15,147 --> 01:27:18,484
and it was a gift from God.

1682
01:27:18,567 --> 01:27:21,570
I knew that I had to use this gift,

1683
01:27:21,654 --> 01:27:25,991
this power that I had, for good.

1684
01:27:26,075 --> 01:27:27,993
So, listen, I just want to say,

1685
01:27:28,077 --> 01:27:29,870
before I go into this next jam,

1686
01:27:29,954 --> 01:27:31,872
I really appreciate
each and every one of you

1687
01:27:31,956 --> 01:27:35,918
from the front to the motherfucking back
that came here to see me rock right now.

1688
01:27:36,001 --> 01:27:38,379
Life is crazy, man.
We all figuring this shit out.

1689
01:27:38,462 --> 01:27:39,546
It’s fucked-up, but we’ll survive.

1690
01:27:39,630 --> 01:27:40,965

1691
01:27:41,048 --> 01:27:43,759

are fucking survivors.

(cheering)

1693
01:27:45,594 --> 01:27:47,346
It’s been a long ride

1694
01:27:47,429 --> 01:27:49,807
since my mixtape,
and you guys have been so supportive

1695
01:27:49,890 --> 01:27:51,475
in dealing with me all these years.

1696
01:27:51,558 --> 01:27:53,018
-MAN: I love you, Scott!
-MAN 2: We love you!

1697
01:27:53,102 --> 01:27:56,480
And to come to the show tonight,
to see all the beautiful faces

1698
01:27:56,563 --> 01:27:58,607
in the building, all the love, is just...

1699
01:27:58,691 --> 01:28:01,610
it’s still overwhelming to me,
after all these years.

1700
01:28:01,694 --> 01:28:03,904
I just really want to let
you guys know, you know,

1701
01:28:03,988 --> 01:28:05,781
when I was going through my shit,
I really appreciated

1702
01:28:05,864 --> 01:28:07,408
that you guys never
turned your back on me,

1703
01:28:07,491 --> 01:28:10,327
you never judged me,
you never left me hanging,

1704
01:28:10,411 --> 01:28:13,831
and I could come out here
and see all this love...

1705
01:28:13,914 --> 01:28:16,250
(crowd cheering)

1706
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:19,753
...from albums I dropped a year ago
or two years ago or three years ago.

1707
01:28:19,837 --> 01:28:22,047
I mean, the shit is insane.

1708
01:28:22,131 --> 01:28:25,426
I know I’m helping you guys,
but guess what--

1709
01:28:25,509 --> 01:28:28,137
you guys are helping me
more than you know.

1710
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:29,972
This shit is like group therapy.

1711
01:28:30,055 --> 01:28:31,724
It’s amazing.

1712
01:28:31,807 --> 01:28:33,058
(cheering)

1713
01:28:33,142 --> 01:28:35,728
I knew that that was my mission.

1714
01:28:35,811 --> 01:28:39,064
I knew that that’s why I was born.

1715
01:28:40,315 --> 01:28:42,526
It’s my destiny.

1716
01:28:43,694 --> 01:28:46,947
Everything I make
has to help people in some way.

1717
01:28:48,323 --> 01:28:50,451
Like, it has to.

1718
01:28:50,534 --> 01:28:53,662
I can’t make music any other way.

1719
01:28:53,746 --> 01:28:55,664
And that’s always been the goal--

1720
01:28:55,748 --> 01:28:58,834
like, to inspire others...

1721
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:02,546
...so they can tell their story.

1722
01:29:02,629 --> 01:29:05,007
I felt like the rap game
needed more of that.

1723
01:29:05,090 --> 01:29:06,633
Now it’s like...

1724
01:29:06,717 --> 01:29:08,385
you can’t get a deal

1725
01:29:08,469 --> 01:29:11,388
unless you sing
and talk about your emotions.

1726
01:29:11,472 --> 01:29:16,310
And we single-handedly infected
the industry with that shit

1727
01:29:16,393 --> 01:29:18,062
in 2009.

1728
01:29:18,145 --> 01:29:23,734
It sent a ripple effect through
the whole entire industry for a decade.

1729
01:29:25,027 --> 01:29:27,362
So...

1730
01:29:27,446 --> 01:29:29,323
you’re welcome.
