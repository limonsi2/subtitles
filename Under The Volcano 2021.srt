Going to Montserrat
was like going into a dream.

4
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:32,634
It's always different.

5
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,596
Reality's always different
from what you think it will be.

6
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:48,400
I love the idea of wilderness
on the edge of civilization.

7
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:56,158
I think the volcano itself is a kind
of presiding spirit over the island,

8
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:58,535
and it definitely gives you a sense

9
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,748
that you're living
on the edge of something seismic.

10
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:13,008
When the volcano went off,
that was a pinnacle point of change.

11
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:16,720
A point where nothing was ever
gonna be quite the same again.

12
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:21,600
In the way we recorded,
in the way that music was dealt with.

13
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,895
Those magical moments
are gonna be no longer.

14
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:32,444
It was a glorious dream
that George Martin had.

15
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,280
And it's so sad, as always,

16
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:40,827
to see a glorious dream come to an end
and be destroyed.

17
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,914

VYE ROBINSON: Montserrat's in the
Caribbean. It's very close to Antigua.

24
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:09,124
But because it's so small,
it really is that hidden gem.

25
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:12,252
They used to call it the Hidden Gem
and the Emerald Isle of the Caribbean.

26
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:15,797
Montserrat was colonized by the Irish.
That's why the island is so different

33
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:38,195
JUSTIN "HERO" CASSELL:
Soca is a hybrid of calypso music.

34
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:43,283
Calypso music originated in Nigeria
and came to the West Indies.

35
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:46,536
These islands, you know,
they were part of the slave trade.

36
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,539

MINETTA ALLEN FRANCIS:
Montserrat is just a lovely place.

39
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:58,840
There is an atmosphere in Montserrat

40
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,760
that just makes you want to live
in Montserrat.

MIDGE URE: There was no doubt
there was a magic on Montserrat.

42
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,686
This island was kind of untouched.

43
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:16,399
There were no big corporate signs
for chain restaurants.

44
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,819
And here was no American money in there,

45
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:22,697
just these old shacks and tin roofs,

46
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:25,826
and brightly colored
and painted beautifully.

47
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:28,411
And you felt
as though you were in a time warp.

48
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:32,833
This little island had a heart
that you could feel, you know?

49
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:39,673
KNOPFLER: It didn't have the
sophistication you'd feel straight away

50
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:43,718
if you went to Antigua
or anywhere else like that.

51
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:47,472
It was far more innocent,
far more quiet.

52
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:51,226
STING: There's definitely a mystique
about the island.

53
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,687
It's quite a place, actually.
It's really dramatic.

54
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:56,857
These, you know, very sheer cliffs.

55
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:59,359
And, of course,
the fertility of the island

56
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:04,614
is a function of this volcanic ash
that comes down periodically.

57
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,908
It hadn't come down for a long time,

58
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,996
but the island was blooming
and blossoming, everything grew.

59
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:15,500
I often wonder why George Martin
chose a volcanic island

60
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,919
to put his beautiful studio on.

Originally, Dad, he was a mad visionary

63
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:32,726
I think always liked the idea
of pushing boundaries.

64
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,853
Think about what he did
with the Beatles in the '60s.

65
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,314
He pushed the boundaries
with the recording studios.

66
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,899
He wanted to do something different.

67
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,443

72
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,248
JOHN LENNON: They either say
that George Martin did everything

73
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,709
or the Beatles did everything.
It was neither one, you know?

74
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:03,632
He had a very great musical knowledge
and background.

75
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,676
So he could translate for us
and suggest a lot of things.

76
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,762
We'd be saying we want it to go...

77

000-000 and eee-eee.

78
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,225
He'd say, "Well, look, chaps,
I thought of this this afternoon.

79
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,937
Last night, I was talking to..."
whoever he was talking to.

00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,605
"And I came up with this."

81
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,650

"Great. Great. We'll put it on here."

82
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,277
It's hard to say who did what, you know?

83
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,613
I mean, he taught us a lot.
I'm sure we taught him a lot.

GERRY BECKLEY: A record producer
is not like a film producer.

85
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:31,952
A record producer
is much more like a film director.

86
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:35,038
One thing that was unique to George
that a lot of producers didn't have

87
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,832
is that he was also the arranger.

88
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:41,628
That's very often a completely
different person, different element.

89
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,672
In George's case,
his work as an arranger

90
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:47,217
would be, for example, the strings
in Eleanor Rigby or something.

91
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:50,387
If you think of some
of the famous producers of our time,

92
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,640
the wall of sound, Phil Spector,

93
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:56,810
where he controlled
every note of every instrument

94
00:07:56,935 --> 00:08:00,397
and was just a tyrant and stuff,
George was not at all like that.

95
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,358
But there was a serious element

96
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:09,239
of just kind of good Pythonesque
British crazy in there.

97
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:10,740
Just a lovely combination.

(& "THREE AMERICAN SKETCHES:
II. OLD BOSTON" BY GEORGE MARTIN)

99
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:25,588
He knew how to get from you
the best that you could give.

100
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:28,133
Which was extraordinary,
in the most wonderful way.

101
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:32,053
Elegant, gentlemanly,
loving, nurturing way.

102
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,931
He would make any musician
a much better musician

103
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,683
by spending five minutes with them.

104
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:39,686
You can put a very soft flute
against a huge brass chord

105
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,104
and still make it sound loud.

106
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,815
And then cut up the tape,
threw it up in the air,

107
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,359
until it settled down on the ground,
and joined them up again together.

108
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:50,280
So it just became
like a patchwork quilt.

109
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,323
This is the kind of thing
you can do on a recording,

110
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,409
which you obviously
couldn't possibly do it live

111
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,536
because it is making up music
as you go along.

112
00:08:56,661 --> 00:09:00,582
He's largely responsible,
along with the Beatles,

113
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:05,962
for giving everybody
that came after them in music a career.

114
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:11,468
What the Beatles did with their albums,
no one will ever top that.

<i>NEWSREEL: It is a moment in history

117
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:23,188
The Beatles have decided
to call it a day.

118
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,482
BECKLEY: Well, a lot of things
happened at that time.

119
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:29,402
Obviously, the Beatles broke up,
and so, George was free from EMI.

120
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,821
So I guess he became his own boss.

121
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,866
But frankly, if you're known
as the Beatles' producer,

122
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,367
anything you do after that,

123
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,454
it's virtually impossible
to get anywhere near that.

124
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:41,581
GILES MARTIN: I think my dad
was tired of the confines

125
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,750
of a very rigid company structure,

126
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,586
which was Abbey Road,
or EMI Studios as it was at the time.

127
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,631
And he wanted to build a place
which was more artist friendly.

128
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,883
Abbey Road
obviously created great music,

129
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,676
but they always found...

130
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,595
I mean, the fridge
was locked every night.

131
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,182
They had to break in to get milk
for their cups of tea.

132
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:02,393
Even the loo roll had Abbey Road on it,
so you wouldn't steal it.

133
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,396
It was very much a...
It was like a proper English factory.

134
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:09,192
MALCOLM ATKIN: There's no doubt
in my mind that George had a vision

135
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,737
of how recording
could or should be done.

136
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:18,910
Through the '70s was a period
of great excess in the music business.

137
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:25,083
Um, it was an era when
there wasn't such a thing as a budget.

138
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,544
There was a need to make some music.

139
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:31,256
COOPER: The '70s
was one of the most exciting periods

140
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,967
in musical recording time.

141
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,511
And a few times,
I've been in EMI, Abbey Road,

142
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:41,057
and normally I would bump into George,
but he wasn't there.

143
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:44,018
And I wondered what was going on,
and they said,

144
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:47,480
"He's making his own studio now.
AIR London it's gonna be called.”

right in the middle of town.

00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:03,121

151
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,529
There's a momentum shift
which happens with successful studios.

152
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,698
But I think my dad
wanted to do something different

153
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:39,824
in the recording space.

154
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,576
He wanted to record
in a different location.

155
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,912
Then he built AIR
and he thought, "Where next?"

156
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:47,040
George was looking for something,
you know,

157
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,209
which wasn't in the middle of London.

158
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:52,921
Somewhere where the people
could come and record,

159
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:56,466
and his plan was
there'd be a lack of hangers-on.

160
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:59,427
It would just be them
and their families.

161
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:03,306
HARRIES: Then he had an idea
that he would put a studio on a boat.

162
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,808
He had a boat in line,
which we went and looked at,

163
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:09,103
a great big, big boat, and we were
going to put a studio in the middle

164
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:12,023
so we could go to anywhere in the world
and record people.

165
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:16,277
Then he realized that just the diesel
generators would make a noise

166
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,196
in every single recording he made.

167
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,616
So then he looked at islands,
looked at Island Paradise,

168
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:25,078
looked at that idea about
building a studio and found Montserrat.

169
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,664
HARRIES: And suddenly,
he comes up to me and says,

170
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,541
"Dave, we're flying out to Montserrat.
I want to show you something.

171
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,753
I've just bought a house
and I've bought an estate,

172
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,589
and I want you to build a studio there."

173
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,554
I'd read about Montserrat
in a Canadian magazine.

174
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,057
They described it,
"The Emerald Isle of the Caribbean."

175
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,559
So, I went there for a few days
and fell in love with the place,

176
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:53,064
and with the people,
because they're such gentle people.

177
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:57,026
And I loved it so much,
I bought a place, simple as that.

178
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,779
KNOPFLER: Montserrat, for George,
was something more

179
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,573
than just a commercial operation.

180
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,076
He'd fallen in love with Montserrat.

181
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,413
And he had something else in his mind,

182
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:14,210
just to be able to tie in creativity
with being in a special place.

183
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:18,715
COOPER: George's idea was
to take people out of an environment,

184
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,301
to put them into harmony with nature,

185
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:26,306
but also have time together
to talk, to have dialogue.

186
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:27,974
And what he knew would happen

187
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,977
was that for a lot of bands
who had never been in that situation,

188
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:37,442
that would evoke new ways of thinking,
and therefore, new musical ideas.

189
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,652
If you look at Montserrat on a map
or had visited it

190
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,113
at that stage in 1976, '77,

191
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,365
you'd never think,
"Let's build a recording studios here."

192
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,327
In the same way you start
building the studios, you don't think,

193
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:50,621
"Let's get Rupert Neve to build
a custom desk and put it in this space.”

194
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:54,208
HARRIES: The heart of any studio
is the mixing console.

195
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:58,504
Geoff Emerick was quite involved
in what was gonna go on in Montserrat.

196
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:05,053
So Geoff didn't want to use
a current type of Neve console.

197
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,388
So Rupert redesigned the desk.

198
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:12,268
He said, "It will wipe everything else
off the planet, this desk."

199
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,062
AIR Studios, part of AIR's fame

200
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:20,109
was that it had these three
incredible-sounding Neve consoles.

201
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,070
And they had one at AIR Montserrat.

202
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:26,074
Neve desks, to me, it sounded musical.

203
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,159
You could actually tune into something,

204
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,119
you could bring out
the character of something.

00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,390
was the ultimate challenge.

211
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:55,311
And it was very brave of them, too,
because if something went really wrong,

212
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:59,273
your closest port of call was Miami.

213

with the most extraordinary piece
of equipment inside of it,

215
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,534
with about 30 builders all round it,

216
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:13,371

of the truck onto the oil drums.

You have an interest in a studio abroad.

Recently, I built a studio
out in the Caribbean.

out there.

(5 "VOLCANO" BY JIMMY BUFFET)

228
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:14,098
BUFFET: We were, I believe,
the second band that recorded there,

229
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:17,143
and, you know, I love island culture
and I love the island people,

230
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:21,272
and I lived on my boat off and on
down there for 20 years.

231
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:25,151
So I didn't have to go back to London
or New York or Nashville to record it.

232
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:28,863
And I was able to take those songs
that were written there

233
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:32,909
and go into that studio
that was built by George Martin.

234
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:36,037
You couldn't get anybody who had
a better reputation at that time.

235
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,372
It was a lovely working environment

236
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:42,877
because you didn't leave,
I would say, the arena of creativity.

237
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:46,672
You were constantly involved
in the creation of this music,

238
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,633
as opposed to, like, being in Nashville,

239
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:51,928
because to me, there are
two ways that you go into the studio.

240
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:55,932
You can go in and look for perfection,
or you can try to capture the magic.

241

At the time, they were not funny

256
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:30,841
because there was
a bit of a colonial aspect to things

00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:33,469

As we went to order the drinks,

you had to do it one at a time
and have a slip down,

you had to put it in

"That's just the way we do it here."

I was always like, "Are you sure
you wanna be on this island with this?"

was always sort of not going off,

00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:39,465
So it was something
that was really quite special.

330
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:43,344
There weren't many residential studios
of that quality.

331
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:48,224
It was like it was all one big band.
It was like everybody was in the band.

332
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:52,394
George the cook was in the band,
the housekeeper was in the band.

333
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,231
It just all kind of overlapped,
it was not separate.

334
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:58,067
It was like one big beautiful thing.

335
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:01,111
FRANCIS:
Earth, Wind & Fire were very lovely.

336
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:03,906
They came right here in this house.

337
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:08,577
I invite them to come for dinner.
Some of them came.

338
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:12,081
And when they came,
I had a daughter, a pretty daughter.

339
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:13,833
One of them wanted the daughter,

340
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:17,336
but he didn't get that chance. (LAUGHS)

341
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:21,465
STEVE JACKSON:
The staff all had their own quirks.

342
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,883
Blues, one of the drivers,

343
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,845
whenever he wanted to say something,
he'd go, "Let me talk."

344
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:28,764
Earth, Wind & Fire have a track
on that album called Let Me Talk.

345
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:32,893
For a band to come in
and write a song about a driver,

346
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,854
must've had an influence.

347
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:37,481
I think in order to build a studio
that people love,

348
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,525
it's all based around the staff.

349
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,652
Montserrat was a bit like Fawlty Towers.

350
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,113
It had these crazy characters
running around.

351
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:48,576
Because it was a single studio space,
with no other bands there,

352
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:51,620
the characters
that worked in the studios themselves

353
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,664
became part of people's lives.

354
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,584
Tappy Morgan, or George Morgan,
was the chef.

355
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,002
He was great. He was very emotional.

356
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:01,463
We all remember George, the chef,
I think.

357
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,384
He was quite an imposing gentleman.

358
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,595
GEORGE "TAPPY" MORGAN:
That was the best job

359
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,929
I ever had in my entire life.

360
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:14,101
Every band... gave me a big tip.

361
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,020
And you know the reason why?

362
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:19,315
Because I made them good food.
And everybody was happy.

363
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:24,069
Phil Collins, Eric Clapton, Mick Jagger,
Keith Richards, Paul McCartney.

364
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:29,950

369

you would hear tap, tap, tap...

MCCARTNEY: After the Beatles,
none of us wanted to work with George.

380
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:52,783
It wasn't that we didn't want
to be produced by him.

381
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:58,205
We all would have loved the discipline
and the expertise that George has,

382
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,290
but it was that he'd been associated
with the Beatles.

383
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,710
GEORGE MARTIN: We were very
apprehensive about it to begin with,

384
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:03,877
both of us I think,

385
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:07,131
because although we've been
very good friends over the years,

386
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:12,177
not having actually had
to have the hassles of working,

387
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:15,014
we were all
a little bit not sure about it.

was working with my father near London

on two albums,
Tug of War and Pipes of Peace,

390
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:25,190
and my father persuaded Paul
to go to Montserrat.

391
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:29,403
ATKIN: Because I was the chief engineer,
I got the call from George, like,

392
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,196
"You built this place."

393
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:35,075

on West 72nd Street

398

In those 14 hours,

and all the people
who loved him so much.

403
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:15,908
I also feel very angry, that it's
such a senseless thing to happen,

404
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:19,119
that one of the great people
that have happened this century

405
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,331
can be just wiped out by madness.
I'm very angry about it.

406
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,798
ATKIN: Paul came down to the island,

407
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:33,884
sadly only a few weeks
after Lennon died.

408
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,887
And it was touch and go before Christmas

409
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,515
as to whether this actually
was going to happen.

410
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:42,601
They were very, very nervous.

411
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:46,021
An entire security firm
from New York City flew down

412
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,940
ahead of the band arriving.

413
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:53,862
And they would go everywhere,
just to protect the band.

414
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:57,282
And they didn't even have a good time,
because they were just being a nuisance.

415
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,118
You don't need that security
in Montserrat.

if you're a cricketer or an athlete,

418
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:10,087
people will be asking
for your autograph.

419

If you're a musician, they hear you
on the radio all the time, no big deal.

420
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:16,301
So they sent
their security guards packing.

421
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:20,472
They would chill out in Kinsale,
in Salem, at the local bars.

waved our bye-byes, and they all left.

499
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:53,995
We would all drive up
to St George's Hill

500

and we would all sit up there,
maybe having a beer,

just clearing our heads.

510
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:35,745
which went from about 1977
to about 1980.

517
00:32:53,054 --> 00:33:00,145

in England and in Holland,

518
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:03,982
where we would work
from ten in the evening till dawn.

24-hour stereo video music channel.

522
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:22,083
STING: I think the success of The Police
really was a happy accident,

523
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:26,588
because it was
the beginning of the MTV era,

524
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:31,218
and we had a whole slew of videos
we'd already made

525
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:36,598
and there was this channel,
custom-built to receive these videos.

526
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:43,522
And we became a staple on MTV,
which, of course, added to our success.

STEWART COPELAND: By the third album,
we'd had a couple of hits

530
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:55,867
and the record company are saying,

531
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:59,538
"This is now going to be the big one,
if you get this next album right."

532
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:02,374
And the record company
were there with us to ensure

533
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:06,044
that we did not stray from the path
of commercial success.

534
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:11,633
So, for the next album we went 12 hours'
flight away from the record company,

535

but he wasn't our producer.

551
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,351
Our producer was a man
called Hugh Padgham.

George was more of

and then write lyrics or write a tune,
and then make the album.

00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:27,667

I was taught by a guy called Danny.

560
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:38,219
He was very patient with me
because I was a very slow learner.

He's a very brilliant man,
very good friend of mine.

Respects me much.

563
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:50,190
He said, "Danny, you taught me something

COPELAND: By this time in our career,
our main songwriter had a technique,

583
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:52,419
which is to not reveal his songs
until we needed them.

584
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:57,757
And this song came in
and we heard the demo,

585
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,634

00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:34,200
We arrived there, and it was
just such a shock to suddenly be there.

657
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:38,121
It was like,
"Oi! What are we doing here?" (LAUGHS)

658
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:41,541
We had a couple of days to get over
the jetlag, and then we were off.

659
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,668
NIGEL OLSSON: Montserrat
was a whole different deal.

660
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:47,046
The room was fantastic.
It just had a great atmosphere.

661
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:50,967
It had George all over it, the studio.
It was just so cool.

662
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:54,554
I hadn't got any material
before I arrived in Montserrat,

663
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:57,140
and I wrote 12 songs there.

664
00:41:57,265 --> 00:41:59,684
It's always the danger
that you might not be able to write.

665
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:01,102
So I quite like that.

666
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:03,396
For the first half an hour
when I was trying to write,

667
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:05,273
I couldn't write anything
and I was panicking.

668
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:09,193
But the way we write, it's very strange.
With Bernie and I, it's something...

669
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:11,821
It just works, there's a magic there.

670
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:14,157
Until Too Low for Zero,
with Elton and Bernie,

671
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:16,576
it had been all over the place.

672
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:19,871
They hadn't been together much,
hadn't been writing together.

673
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:23,041
And this was the first album back.
It was all Bernie.

674
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:26,085
And all the original band.

675
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,547
So it was quite a remarkable event.

676
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,716
OLSSON: We were all
on the same wavelength.

677
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:35,136
We didn't have to tell each other
how it should be.

678
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:40,349
And the beauty also was
that we heard the songs being written.

679
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:42,477
So we were in there from the start.

JOHNSTONE: I remember the day

682
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:57,658
that we wrote I Guess That's Why
They Call It the Blues,

683
00:42:57,784 --> 00:43:01,412
because to me, it's one
of the greatest love songs of all time.

684
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:05,083
And we wrote it in 20 minutes.
Again, it wasn't like a big thing.

685
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:08,252
It was like, "OK, this, this, this.
Yeah, that sounds great.”

686
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:10,213
And, "Let's get the guys in,
let's record it."

698
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:54,924
One day, Elton said,
"Where'd did you go last night?"

699
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:58,094
I said, "We went to this new place.
We found this new place."

700
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:00,847
He said, "Where is it?"
I said, "I'll show you."

701
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:03,683
So, we were driving along

702
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:07,311
and we go past
this totally rundown place

703
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:10,022
with a bit of corrugated iron
over the top.

704
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:12,483
And Elton goes,
"I love places like that.

705
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,360
Nobody ever invites me
to places like that."

706
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,279

It's, you know, the bloke
who lives in the Ritz all the time.

708
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:20,700
So, we went there.

709
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:25,037
All right now, this is
where we do portionable dining.

710
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:28,207
MORGAN: The Village Place
was just like ordinary place,

711
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,334
like in the ghetto,

712
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:34,505
where everybody hangs around
and they serve chicken wings

713
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:37,842
and you go into the bar
and have some bush rum.

714
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:40,720
RILEY: But I liked Elton John very much,

715
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:43,931
because he makes
the whole place lively, very lively.

716
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:47,518
Yeah, whenever he come here,
man, he just come out,

717
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,478
- and start dancing.
- He's a good guy.

718
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:52,148
Just dancing in the yard.

719
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,858
RILEY: He was a good guy.

720
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:57,111
OLIVER: He would take off his shades
and give it to whoever wanted it.

721

the bar is open until he leave.

MICHAEL PAUL STAVROU: After dinner,

727
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:22,553
we would all congregate back into
the control room with pifia coladas

728
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,764
and sit back and listen to the album.

729
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:31,020
And then, Elton would play it again.
And then, a third time.

730
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:33,481
About a week into the album,

731
00:45:33,606 --> 00:45:38,986
everybody went to bed after playing
the album through only once,

732
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:40,279
which upset Elton.

733
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,907
He started ranting about
something about throwing...

734
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:45,576
"It was a shit album.
I'm gonna throw the tapes in the pool."

735
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:49,413
And Mike, very, very swiftly,
brilliant idea,

736
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:53,459
gave him about six blank two-inch tapes.

737
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:56,379
Elton went out and threw
the whole lot in the swimming pool.

738

When we were working
on Too Low for Zero,

741
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:11,519
Dee had been suffering from cancer.

742
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:15,439
So he wasn't in the studio all the time.

743
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:18,859
Then we got a phone call
one morning saying,

744
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:21,821
"Nigel can't come in.
He's not very well.”

745
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:25,074
So Elton went, "What the fuck?"

746
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:28,869
He said, "They're all dropping
like flies!" (LAUGHS)

747
00:46:28,995 --> 00:46:33,708
And over there in the distance,
there's a kind of shelf by the window

748
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:35,626
separating the control room
and the studio,

749
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:38,504
and there's this huge cloud
of marijuana smoke.

750
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:41,173
And lying there, absolutely prone,

751
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:46,053
was Adrian who was in charge
of all the logistics for the recordings.

752

Out of this smoke this voice said,
"Well, I'm still standing."

Elton and I just looked at each other,
we just collapsed with laughter.

Then, the next minute,
Elton picked himself up,

still be with them,

We were all getting excited because
Montserrat's carnival is at Christmas.

There's something in the air

RHODES:
We'd just finished the Rio album,

822
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:46,085
and we were chasing The Police,

823
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,921
because they were
a little bit older than us.

824
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:52,383
They were ahead of us in America,
and it was time to make another album.

825
00:50:52,508 --> 00:50:55,052
And then we thought,
"We can't go back to England.”

826
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:59,181
Because it was just a little too crazy
with all the hysteria at that point.

827
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:01,517
We couldn't really move in the street.

828
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,811
So we wanted
to get as far away as we could.

829
00:51:03,936 --> 00:51:08,691
AIR Studios Montserrat looked
very appealing from the brochures.

830
00:51:08,816 --> 00:51:12,820
And, of course,
having George Martin involved,

00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:16,240

being in a surrealist painting.

834
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:31,338
You go, and there's black sand
everywhere, and the volcano,

00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:34,675
and these giant iguanas.

836
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,511
One thing that was a bit of a shock

837
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:42,099
was that we were used
to living our lives

838
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:45,311
completely under media scrutiny.

839
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:48,105
And it was days when you'd wake up

840
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:52,026
and there'd be someone hiding
in your hedge in your front garden.

841
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:56,572
You'd have to draw the curtains quickly
when you're having breakfast.

842
00:51:57,698 --> 00:52:02,036
So, suddenly there, there was no one.

843
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:07,249

00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:26,852
We're not that straight-laced.
We're making rock 'n' roll.

When we first arrived,

849
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:33,692
and when we made it known
to the staff at the studio

850
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:35,527
that we wanted some grass,

851
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:39,740
within, I don't know, 15 minutes,
some kid arrived with a plant

852
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:42,785
that he just uprooted
and stuck in a carrier bag.

00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:56,006

to be at a studio in the Caribbean,

856

then go off and have fun in the sea.

when you wanna do something
with a little experimentation.

860
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:20,114
And so I really had a bit
of personality clash with it creatively.

861
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:24,868
And I ended up working
into the night mostly in the studio,

862
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:28,580
because there was no disruptions,
people weren't running out of the door

we were disconnected from the fans

And they were
at the height of their fame.

00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:59,963
So, of course, they were probably
wanting to be in the jet-set place.

888

So, it wasn't exactly right for them.

was they lost sight

Coming to an island like this,

914
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:05,005
you were shoved
straight back into each other's faces

915
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,715
and you had to
go and make another album.

00:57:48,382 --> 00:57:51,009
we had only each other
to drive each other bananas.

although we were screaming
and shouting at each other,

00:57:57,808 --> 00:58:03,146

941
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:18,787
Then there was the control room,

942
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:24,001
Sting was in there playing his bass,
and Stewart was up in the dining room.

We were playing together,
but weren't seeing each other.

944
00:58:26,378 --> 00:58:28,964
We were all completely isolated

945
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,173

00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:35,303
this is a different period

948
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:37,431

in the dining room,

952
00:58:45,105 --> 00:58:48,191
because it was lonely and grumpy.

953
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:52,571
And it wasn't the feeling
of what I liked about the band,

954
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:55,157
which was the interaction.

I couldn't wait to get off that island

957

is kind of storied

959
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:12,007
and it may well be exaggerated.

960
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:18,013
But for me, it was a function
of the creative process.

961
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:22,434
You have three alpha males

962

We weren't physically aggressive
with each other,

but it got pretty heated in there

965
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:36,114
but really because we cared passionately
about what each of us were doing.

And, um... But it was not easy.

967

It was great to have an environment
around us where you could escape to.

In fact, I went up to the volcano
a couple of times.

01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:11,399
It was tense, the atmosphere was tense,
like we shouldn't be doing this anymore.

01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:13,151
We need a producer.

978
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:16,113
I said, "What about George Martin?
He produced the Beatles. Surely?"

979
01:00:16,238 --> 01:00:19,991
And we were up there,
so he'll probably take the job.

980
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:22,994
Sting and Stewart said,
"Well, you go and get him then."

981
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,454
So I said, "Right, I will."

982
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:27,958

So we're having a cup of tea.

984
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,796
I start to tell him
about the problems with the band.

985
01:00:32,921 --> 01:00:36,383
And I said, "We'd like you
to come over and produce us."

986
01:00:36,508 --> 01:00:38,385
He said, "Um... not sure.”

987
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:40,762
Maybe he wasn't
in the producing mood at that point.

988
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:43,765
He said, "I think you can sort it out.
You're grown-ups.

989
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:47,185
Come on, I think you can do it.
There's a lot at stake here."

990
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:51,022
So, we had a very nice time
having tea and chatting.

991
01:00:51,148 --> 01:00:54,317
I walked all the way back
across the valley in the beating heat,

992

to one another

had three distinct personalities

1041
01:03:52,704 --> 01:03:57,834
But I did decide during that recording
that I didn't want to do this again.

1042
01:03:57,959 --> 01:04:02,088
That we had achieved everything
we set out to do as a band,

1043
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:06,760
and achieved it tenfold, a hundredfold
more than our expectations,

1044
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:11,264
and so, after that, I figured
it would just be diminishing returns.

1045
01:04:11,348 --> 01:04:16,353

we'd gained to set out on my own.

and there was a big demand
to see the band live.

Because the feeling was
that not only could we do it all live,

we were both displeased

Dire Straits' manager
was conscious of that

1083
01:06:49,297 --> 01:06:53,009
and encouraged Mark to record the album
digitally and mix it digitally.

1084

So, it was an all-digital recording

to sort of keep that energy higher,

there were a couple of windsurf boards,

DORSFMAN: Brothers in Arms was one
of the first all-digital recordings,

1149
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:07,472
and that in tandem with MTV
blowing up at the same time,

1150
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:09,390
I think that's a huge reason

1151
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:11,934
why everything changed for the band
at that point.

1152
01:11:12,059 --> 01:11:14,103

KNOPFLER: I didn't have a clue about
how successful the album was.

1156
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:26,073
I don't think we did.
Never thought about it.

1157
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:31,579
When Philips invented the CD
and then brought it out,

1158
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:34,832
that just coincided
with the release of Brothers.

1159
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:39,962
So they took that and used it as,
"This is what CD sounds like."

1160
01:11:40,087 --> 01:11:43,508
And then, they used all
their sales outlets to play the record.

1161
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:48,429
So that was an additional thing
that just happened by a fluke, really.

1162
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:51,390
DORSFMAN: In the '80s,
somebody smart figured out

1163
01:11:51,516 --> 01:11:54,060
that you can make a boatload
of money in the record business.

1164
01:11:54,185 --> 01:11:56,771
And with the cheapness of CDs,

1165
01:11:56,854 --> 01:12:02,610
to make a CD, to fully manufacture,
everything was less than a dollar.

1166
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:05,404
So, there was a calculation there,

1167
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:09,700
and like everything in the modern world,
it quickly became monetized.

1168
01:12:10,117 --> 01:12:15,039
MAN: There was a lot of excitement
associated with the coming of the CD.

1169
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:16,833
The consumer loved it.

1170
01:12:16,958 --> 01:12:20,753
As a result, the record industry
exploded at that point.

ROBINSON: For us, the Rolling Stones
coming to the studio was a big thing.

1176
01:12:51,742 --> 01:12:55,955
Because obviously, George
is more associated with the Beatles,

1177
01:12:56,080 --> 01:13:00,084

the X-Pensive Winos and it was fabulous.

I was talking to him

1182

is one of my favorite bands."”

1183
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:15,683
I asked him
if they were coming back together.

1184
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:20,396

who could put the band back together,

1185
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:23,190
and I'm going to put it back together
and we'll come here and record.”

01:13:23,316 --> 01:13:25,735
- And they did come to Montserrat.
- Yeah, man.

1187
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:29,405
Keith has always insisted
that Mick is the lead singer,

1193
01:13:40,041 --> 01:13:41,751
means the end of the Rolling Stones?

1303
01:20:19,523 --> 01:20:23,193
is directly related
to the shift from analog to digital.

1304
01:20:23,319 --> 01:20:27,281
A lot of the restrictions we dealt with
in recording analog

1305
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:32,578
were lovely parameters
to keep the reins kinda tight.

1306
01:20:32,703 --> 01:20:35,247
And with digital came unlimited options,

1307
01:20:35,331 --> 01:20:38,751
and I think things took
a pretty serious shift at that change.

1308
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:43,213
ROBINSON:
It's as if there is something there

1309
01:20:43,339 --> 01:20:46,216
that drew all that music,
drew all that creativity,

1310
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:48,427
and then it was like,
"The power's gone now."

1311
01:20:48,552 --> 01:20:50,471
So, that's finished and move on.

1312
01:20:58,937 --> 01:21:00,939
WILLOCK:
We heard that our volcano was dormant,

1313
01:21:01,065 --> 01:21:04,568
but we never understood
until our volcano started erupting

1314
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:07,404
that dormant
actually meant potentially active.

1315
01:21:08,405 --> 01:21:10,240
And so, I was in the studio.

1316
01:21:10,366 --> 01:21:15,162
One of the technicians came and said,
"Rose, the volcano is erupting.”

1317
01:21:15,287 --> 01:21:17,039
(RUMBLING)

1318
01:21:41,647 --> 01:21:46,527
I sat before the microphone, I said,
"Everybody, I know that you are scared.

1319
01:21:46,652 --> 01:21:50,447
If you feel like praying, pray.
If you feel like crying, cry.

1320
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:53,826
But I'll be here,
I'll be here with you all the way.

1321
01:21:53,992 --> 01:21:57,746
All the time, I'll be here, just keep
listening to the radio station.

1322
01:21:57,913 --> 01:22:01,667
This is Rose. It's gonna be OK.
Just stay with me."

1323
01:22:06,296 --> 01:22:08,048
CASSELL:
The sky was just, like, frightening.

1324
01:22:08,173 --> 01:22:11,343
Especially,
I can remember the first ash plume

1325
01:22:11,427 --> 01:22:13,137
that went up about 60,000 feet.

1326
01:22:13,262 --> 01:22:15,722
The whole island,
you have bright sunshine like this,

1327
01:22:15,848 --> 01:22:18,684
and suddenly it's like night,
you can't see a thing.

1328
01:22:19,977 --> 01:22:21,437
WOMAN: No one's here.

1329
01:22:21,562 --> 01:22:26,108
RILEY: For me, it was a very,
very bad experience, it was very scary.

1330
01:22:26,233 --> 01:22:29,027
Because one night,
they tell you to go back home.

1331
01:22:29,153 --> 01:22:31,738
Before the night is out, you gotta move
in the middle of the night again,

1332
01:22:31,864 --> 01:22:36,285
and the next day you don't know
what to do, where you're gonna sleep.

1333
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:40,038
Because all your mind,
"Should I go home?

1334
01:22:40,164 --> 01:22:41,457
Should I stay in the shelter?"

1335
01:22:41,582 --> 01:22:43,333
You don't know what to do.
You're confused.

1336
01:22:43,459 --> 01:22:45,294
(EXPLOSION)

1337
01:23:04,021 --> 01:23:07,774
CASSELL: And you know, we didn't
understand the magnitude of an eruption,

1338
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:09,234
what it can do to an island.

1339
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:13,655
It entirely changed the entire landscape
in Montserrat and the whole country.

1340
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:16,783
And I was amazed what could happen.

1341
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:25,083
SILCOTT: Many, almost all Montserratians
were displaced.

1342
01:23:25,792 --> 01:23:28,587
Whether they were
on that side or this side,

1343
01:23:28,712 --> 01:23:31,256
it was a rough time for everyone here.

1344
01:23:31,381 --> 01:23:34,718
And you just had to go somewhere else
and start over.

1345
01:23:35,344 --> 01:23:36,720
I hate the volcano.

1346
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:40,682
I hated the fact
that it did so much to Montserrat.

1347
01:23:48,106 --> 01:23:50,442
STING:
I remember sailing past Montserrat

1348
01:23:50,526 --> 01:23:53,487
a few years after the volcano erupted,

1349
01:23:53,570 --> 01:23:56,114
and sailing past Plymouth

1350
01:23:56,240 --> 01:24:00,035
and just seeing
what looked like a nuclear winter.

1351
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:02,287
It was covered in white dust.

1352
01:24:02,412 --> 01:24:07,209
This thriving, bustling Caribbean town
was a ghost town.

1353
01:24:07,334 --> 01:24:10,629
And it was frightening and upsetting,

1354
01:24:10,754 --> 01:24:13,257
because I had so many happy memories
of that place

1355
01:24:13,382 --> 01:24:16,969
with my bandmates,
my children, my family.

1356
01:24:17,135 --> 01:24:23,058
It makes me actually kind of tear up
when I think about it because...

1357
01:24:23,934 --> 01:24:28,397
it's a special place
that was taken away,

1358
01:24:28,522 --> 01:24:32,359
that will never be the same again.

1359
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:37,698
You can never go back
and get that same energy again.

1360
01:24:37,823 --> 01:24:40,617
And for the people that lived there,

1361
01:24:40,742 --> 01:24:46,248
for them to lose everything
in just one fleeting instant,

1362
01:24:46,373 --> 01:24:47,833
it devastates me.

1363
01:25:15,152 --> 01:25:17,738
WILLOCK: Most of us cried,
because we lost our town.

1364
01:25:18,864 --> 01:25:22,409
We'd lost that important,
integral part of our history.

1365
01:25:23,702 --> 01:25:26,455
And I can close my eyes
and I'm still back there.

1366
01:25:32,252 --> 01:25:36,465
But since the volcanic activity,
Montserrat has grown in size,

1367
01:25:36,590 --> 01:25:40,927
and for me, I consider it to be
a pleasure to be around at this time

1368
01:25:41,053 --> 01:25:43,555
to see my island grow.

1369
01:25:43,639 --> 01:25:47,934
Because look at all the ash
and the new fertilizer it has brought.

1370
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:52,606
And so, I consider the volcano
to be a perpetual part of who we are.

1371
01:26:00,656 --> 01:26:03,492
JUDY MARTIN: You can't really walk
around the estate now.

1372
01:26:04,701 --> 01:26:08,747
And so, I feel it was of a time.

1373
01:26:09,498 --> 01:26:13,543
And now it should slowly go back
to the jungle where it came from.

1374
01:26:19,966 --> 01:26:22,928
DORSFMAN: The '80s are like
a hundred years in the rear-view mirror.

1375
01:26:23,053 --> 01:26:28,225
It was a very special time,
and quality of studio, and vibe-wise,

1376
01:26:28,350 --> 01:26:32,729
the '80s was like the Renaissance,
the golden era of studio recording.

1377
01:26:37,067 --> 01:26:40,696
COPELAND: Those studios
are kind of an era that has gone.

1378
01:26:40,779 --> 01:26:44,700
Some types of music
are best recorded in a big room,

1379
01:26:44,825 --> 01:26:48,829
but you just get your drums
in that big room for a day,

1380
01:26:48,954 --> 01:26:52,749
and then you go back home and fiddle
with it on your own gear at home.

1381
01:26:52,874 --> 01:26:55,752
It's just not the way
artists make records anymore.

1382
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:02,300
URE: There's footage of that place,
there are photographs of that place,

1383
01:27:02,426 --> 01:27:06,513
there are living memories of that place.
That's history.

1384
01:27:06,638 --> 01:27:10,100
Whether it's around today,

1385
01:27:10,267 --> 01:27:13,270
it's something
that we still carry with us,

1386
01:27:13,395 --> 01:27:15,814
the ones who were lucky enough
to experience it.

1387
01:27:15,939 --> 01:27:19,067
It's still vibrant and alive to us.

1388
01:27:22,404 --> 01:27:24,531
BECKLEY: As technology
has evolved to the point

1389
01:27:24,656 --> 01:27:28,535
where, unbelievable, and people make
whole albums on their phone.

1390
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:33,749
But I think the actual ingredients,
when you conceive of something,

1391
01:27:33,832 --> 01:27:37,586
head, and your heart,
your hands to play an instrument,

1392
01:27:37,711 --> 01:27:40,380
you use some kind of a recording device
to put it down,

1393
01:27:40,505 --> 01:27:42,674
those elements haven't changed.

1394
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:56,062
GEORGE MARTIN: It's like seeing
something you've created

1395
01:27:56,188 --> 01:27:58,982
falling into disrepair.

1396
01:27:59,649 --> 01:28:01,818
But it's like everything in life,
isn't it?

1397
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:03,904
Everything has a period.

1398
01:28:04,029 --> 01:28:07,407
You know, you bring something
out of nothing,

1399
01:28:07,532 --> 01:28:11,411
and it always goes back
to nothing again, whatever.

1400
01:28:12,704 --> 01:28:14,873
GILES MARTIN: My father was a man
who got enormous pleasure

1401
01:28:14,998 --> 01:28:18,168
from other people's happiness.
He passed away years ago,

1402
01:28:18,335 --> 01:28:21,588
but he passed away as a very content man
with what he'd done with his life.

1403
01:28:21,713 --> 01:28:23,965
And Montserrat
was a huge part of that life,

1404
01:28:24,090 --> 01:28:27,761
and a huge part of a dream that
he fulfilled in doing something amazing.

1405
01:28:28,136 --> 01:28:33,725
I think that it had its natural end,
and that it was closure for him.

1406
01:28:34,893 --> 01:28:38,104
(TUNES GUITAR)

1407
01:28:39,564 --> 01:28:41,441
Shall we tune the guitar for you, man?

1408
01:28:41,566 --> 01:28:44,820
COOPER: George knew the space
between the notes

1409
01:28:44,903 --> 01:28:48,323
was as exciting as the note you played.

1410
01:28:48,448 --> 01:28:53,578
That rhythm that keeps us alive,
the heartbeat, it's in all of us.

1411
01:28:53,703 --> 01:28:55,914
It's the heartbeat
you hear in your mother's womb

1412
01:28:56,039 --> 01:28:57,541
that entices you out to dance.

1413
01:28:57,666 --> 01:29:01,336
And we need that. We need to touch base
with what we do as human beings.

1414
01:29:01,461 --> 01:29:05,382
And what better an example
than making music?

1415
01:29:05,507 --> 01:29:07,133
And it's about collaboration.

1416
01:29:07,259 --> 01:29:12,514
It's about the dream that George had
of that wonderful space in Montserrat

1417
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:15,851
where you had the sun,
the sea, nature,

1418
01:29:16,852 --> 01:29:19,396
each other's company and music.
