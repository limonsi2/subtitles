1
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:51,125
All right, this is the most handsome

2
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:53,333
of who we're fighting for, gentlemen.

3
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:02,416
Get down, get down, get down.

4
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,833
We like this house.

5
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,041
We think we're gonna take it.

6
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:29,458
Yes, sir.

7
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:30,750
See you in a bit.

8
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:32,458
Let us know if this thing changes.

9
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,375
Sir, there's a wall up here.

10
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:17,125
Copy that.

11
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:19,083
Why is there a wall?

12
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,708
It's two apartment.

13
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,958
Top of bottom block, two houses.

14
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,291
I understand.

15
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:26,250
Break it.

16
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,666
Redman zero six, propane five four.

17
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,500
Contact individual
headed north to your location.

18
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,250
Silly traffic east
and west of your structure.

19
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:36,083
I have a propane five, ten, five.

20
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:24,208
All stations this
net, all stations this net.

21
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,666
Clearance operations are complete.

22
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,250
All friendly units are RGB at this time.

23
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,791
Be advised you
have new friendly location.

24
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,666
Baker company has moved
north west of your location.

25
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:34,708
Two clicks.

26
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,041
Understand, copy all.

27
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:43,083
Sir, Baker company
we're here and not here.

28
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,625
Two kilometers in this position.

29
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:45,666
Copy that.

30
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,416
Manchu, stand by for sit rip.

31
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,958
Say when ready to copy, over.

32
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:05,250
Long man, send your traffic.

33
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,500
At zero, nine or seven, we observe people

34
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,916
probing our position from the east.

35
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,750
Section PAPO, one, zero, building 174.

36
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:15,500
East of root boiler.

37
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:22,666
At zero, nine, one, two,
we saw amassing at building 175.

38
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,291
North of root Spartan.

39
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:25,000
Break.

40
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,291
At zero, nine or one, six.

41
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,458
A blue dew with
mams north on root Lakers.

42
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:37,833
How copy, over.

43
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:40,791
Yeah, frog man, repeat everything

44
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,000
after blue dew, over.

45
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:49,208
Manchu, a blue dew
with military age males

46
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,166
traveling north on root Lakers.

47
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:52,541
Over.

48
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:54,750
Copy all.

49
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,125
Do you have any more
traffic from my station, over.

50
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:00,500
Negative, Manchu.

51
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,083
There's your signal.

52
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,458
It's good now, still intermittent.

53
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:09,583
Cool.

54
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:17,541
Got eyes on the
northwest corner of building four.

55
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,708
Is that white highlick still there?

56
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:26,208
No, highlick's pulled
out like five minutes ago,

57
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:33,708
but I got a male,
white shirt, dark tracksuit pants

58
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,375
looking at our position.

59
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:37,708
That sounds familiar?

60
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:39,041
Negative.

61
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:40,583
ID any weapons?

62
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:42,583
No weapons.

63
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,250
He's gone.

64
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:51,666
Is he going on the list?

65
00:12:59,125 --> 00:12:59,583
Single man.

66
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:02,625
White shirt, dark tracksuit pants,

67
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,625
building four, northwest corner.

68
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,458
By the way, my blue Nike
hoodie went missing off the base.

69
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,333
If you see somebody out
there wearing it, let me know.

70
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,500
Don't shoot him either, I want it back.

71
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:22,583
Yeah, I'll try. Yeah, I'll try.

72
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:41,083
We should check that round of buildings

73
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:41,958
to the west again.

74
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,416
You can just step
right across with rooftops

75
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:47,250
if you want to, walk right to us, right?

76
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,250
How's it going, Doozer?

77
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,583
Fix six tracking, fix six out.

78
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:11,875
How's it going?

79
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:14,750
Going well.

80
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:19,166
Okay.

81
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:26,791
That's that new guy energy.

82
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:31,208
How's it done, man?

83
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,250
Cigarettes and tea, you want tea?

84
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:35,708
Yeah, I'll pass.

85
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:38,375
What do you got up here?

86
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:39,583
Peakers.

87
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:40,750
Where?

88
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:42,000
Corners of building four.

89
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:49,875
Oh, I got you.

90
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:57,666
I don't see any windows.

91
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:53,250
I can't see anything.

92
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:06,958
You know, he's back.

93
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:08,166
White T-shirt?

94
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:08,625
Mm-hmm.

95
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:28,666
Alpha two, this is one.

96
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,666
We might have guys
starting to move in our position.

97
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,958
Maybe because they heard you sludging

98
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,250
through the fucking wall, right?

99
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,416
We could hear every strike.

100
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,000
Why didn't you just charge?

101
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:39,833
I didn't want to make a noise.

102
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:42,875
I'm not sure that looked out for you.

103
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,958
Profane five four, this is Redman six.

104
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,625
Can you slew your sensor to the east

105
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:50,250
on my position on one zero zero meters?

106
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,833
I'm building per GRG.

107
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:52,833
Call contact.

108
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,666
Redman zero six, stand by.

109
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:56,625
Turning.

110
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,875
OX-855 track group one.

111
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:02,500
Profane five five, looking.

112
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,750
Contact, order I see for time.

113
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,416
Hey, we got an individual who was peeking

114
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:10,333
out of the
northwest corner of building four.

115
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,041
He's disappeared to the west.

116
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,250
Do you see anybody
hanging around that corner over?

117
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:16,625
Stand by, looking.

118
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:22,208
Five four, contacts.

119
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,125
Just be advised
you've been probing our position.

120
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,500
Do you see any
mass or suspicious activity

121
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,750
that can indicate a threat over?

122
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,250
Negative zero six, say you're open.

123
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:37,291
Roger that, profane.

124
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:38,500
Redman out.

125
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:42,750
You keep an eye on that for me?

126
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:43,750
Yeah, yeah.

127
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:47,750
Thank you.

128
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,750
Red scarf, red green jacket.

129
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:03,166
Peeking again, that's the
fourth fucking time he's done that.

130
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:04,541
It's a peeking and probing.

131
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,875
Peeking with Sirius and Ted to probe.

132
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,333
How many times you
gonna let this guy do this?

133
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,500
I don't know, related, I'd be too.

134
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,291
Hey, cowboy, give me a
heads up if you see this guy

135
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:21,250
come to your position.

136
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,041
Head scarf, red green jacket.

137
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,666
Copy, we're gonna
build up a big duty or two.

138
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:30,750
Got a pair of guys
in blue jeans, proven twice.

139
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,375
I have two mams, that
description just showed up here,

140
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:38,000
blue jeans, one red shirt.

141
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:39,500
Yep, that's all.

142
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,375
Oh, it looks like
they're getting their jihad on.

143
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,958
Alpha one, Bravo one, we're in a check.

144
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,916
We're getting rockets, small arms fired.

145
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,541
We're all good right
now, but we're pulling air

146
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:57,125
to our position.

147
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,666
Roger that, check in with BDA when able.

148
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:01,666
We'll go.

149
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:03,833
Alpha five, this is Bravo four.

150
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:07,666
Hey, I think we're gonna
need to pull profane or AO, over.

151
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:10,083
Roger that, Bravo four.

152
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:13,166
Redman zero six is
profane, we have been retest.

153
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:14,666
We have checked off station at this time.

154
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,708
Roger that, profane.

155
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:20,958
Hey, is there a reason
they're pulling air from us

156
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,166
and not sourcing it from somewhere else?

157
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:23,583
I'm on it.

158
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:24,041
What's up?

159
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:27,083
Just lost air support, pushing to Bravo.

160
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,750
Wild Eagle baseball, Eagle two four.

161
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,666
Profane five four
checked off station at this time.

162
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,250
Looking for any
available air assets, over.

163
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:36,666
That's not good.

164
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:38,666
Picture was in contact.

165
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,000
A firm, Wild Eagle base, standing by.

166
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:29,083
Hey cowboy, we're getting movement here.

167
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,583
Hi, the bono.

168
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:35,208
Very giant.

169
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:47,583
Yeah, the streets
are definitely clear now.

170
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,333
Yeah, I'm tracking.

171
00:22:59,166 --> 00:22:59,500
Captain Eric?

172
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:01,750
Captain Eric?

173
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:04,791
It's no good.

174
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,875
They say they call
on all Muslims for jihad.

175
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:13,083
Jihad to come now, to
kill you, to kill Americans.

176
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:14,416
Yeah, that sucks.

177
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:15,833
Yeah, that does suck.

178
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:20,083
All right, go keep lower
deck lockdown, you understand?

179
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:22,500
Yeah, I know, and then there's a job.

180
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:26,416
Hey, downstairs, keep it fucking secure.

181
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:29,083
Okay, hella, that's it.

182
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,125
There's a job and I'm gonna talk to you.

183
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,291
I know.

184
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,750
You think they're gonna do it?

185
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:36,291
I think we're about to find out.

186
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,041
You been in there for a while?

187
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:42,208
Yeah, I live in there now.

188
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:44,375
All right, swap out, I'll relieve you.

189
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:45,083
Yes, sir.

190
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:54,875
Fuck.

191
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:45,166
Oh, fuck.

192
00:24:46,583 --> 00:24:47,750
Hey Frank, jump on this a second.

193
00:24:47,958 --> 00:24:49,750
I'm out of dip and I gotta stretch, dude.

194
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,333
Here, I got you.

195
00:25:41,416 --> 00:26:04,666
I got a blue opal,

196
00:26:05,416 --> 00:26:07,583
moving east to west
towards OP-1 position, over.

197
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:11,125
Roger that, blue.

198
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,208
Blue opal is approaching building three.

199
00:26:38,833 --> 00:26:39,958
Three mams, just exited vehicle.

200
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:42,166
Correction, make that four.

201
00:26:45,375 --> 00:26:46,125
Biting into building three.

202
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:02,041
Fuck.

203
00:27:03,958 --> 00:27:04,458
Fuck.

204
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:14,250
Cowboy, the fourth man at PKM.

205
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,583
Couldn't get the shot off, over.

206
00:27:19,833 --> 00:27:20,041
Wake.

207
00:27:21,583 --> 00:27:22,375
Here you go.

208
00:27:25,916 --> 00:27:26,208
What happened?

209
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:30,958
I couldn't get
him, he ran inside too fast.

210
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:32,833
Wake.

211
00:27:41,416 --> 00:27:42,916
Yeah, we have definite massing.

212
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:46,166
A six mams, just
exited building five in my sector.

213
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:49,375
I'm gonna see him,
I'm gonna see where we are.

214
00:27:56,791 --> 00:27:57,791
Yeah, building three.

215
00:27:58,166 --> 00:27:58,875
I'm gonna take a piss.

216
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:34,791
Oh fuck.

217
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:36,458
No!

218
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,708
Our position is under smaller fire.

219
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:00,416
Frank, Tommy!

220
00:29:00,416 --> 00:29:01,875
Yeah? Tommy, Elliot, you good?

221
00:29:36,833 --> 00:29:37,041
Move!

222
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:47,666
Move man, bulk in the head!

223
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:55,750
Move!

224
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:11,625
You hurt?

225
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:15,583
I'm good, I'm good, check on Elliot.

226
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,208
We got Gary Stone in there.

227
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,208
Put your arm up.

228
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:22,333
Okay.

229
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:24,791
How bad is it?

230
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:26,458
Yeah, we're gonna need a casser back.

231
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:28,375
All right, this is Frogman six,

232
00:30:28,416 --> 00:30:29,750
Romeo, we are troops in contact

233
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,875
at our last known position.

234
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:32,541
More info to follow, stand by.

235
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:34,250
Wild Eagle baseball, Eagle two, four.

236
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:36,125
We are troops in contact,

237
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,708
requesting immediate air support, over.

238
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:38,750
Alpha two, this is one.

239
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:40,791
We've had grenades
thrown into our position.

240
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,250
Copy, one word, contact two.

241
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:45,291
Elliot is injured, are we coming to you

242
00:30:45,291 --> 00:30:46,041
or are you coming to us?

243
00:30:46,791 --> 00:30:47,250
Stand by.

244
00:30:49,541 --> 00:30:49,750
Hey!

245
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:52,041
Downstairs, keep it fucking secure.

246
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:52,958
I'm shot.

247
00:30:54,541 --> 00:30:55,291
Alpha one, we're moving.

248
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,083
You will let you know when we're inbound.

249
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:01,000
All right, all OPs are under attack.

250
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,083
This is what we're gonna do.

251
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:03,708
We're gonna collapse to the first deck,

252
00:31:04,125 --> 00:31:05,416
Casa Vachelia, break it down,

253
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:06,416
let's get ready to move.

254
00:31:07,708 --> 00:31:08,583
Collapse, collapse.

255
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:17,750
OP two, what's your status?

256
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,708
I gotta get the receiver.

257
00:31:19,625 --> 00:31:21,041
Sir, sir, sir, sir,
sir, sir, what are you doing?

258
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:22,208
I gotta get the receiver.

259
00:31:23,041 --> 00:31:24,250
We're in a check, all right.

260
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:25,958
Mack, not a good idea.

261
00:31:27,833 --> 00:31:29,291
This is Frogman six, Romeo,

262
00:31:29,291 --> 00:31:31,625
we need to Casa Vac at
our last known position, over.

263
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:32,333
Cover him, yeah.

00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:39,083
Frogman confirmed,

Good read back.

270
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:57,083
Frogman, anti-amplifying remarks over.

271
00:31:57,875 --> 00:31:59,250
Negative, no amplifying remarks,

272
00:31:59,541 --> 00:32:01,375
just need to Casa
Vac, devise on ETA, over.

00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,833
Yeah, I'm, guys,

275
00:32:09,875 --> 00:32:10,500
Where is it?

276
00:32:10,958 --> 00:32:12,333
I don't fucking know,
dude, it's in there somewhere.

277
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:16,833
I have my shit's in there too.

278
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,250
All right, all right, I got it, I got it.

279
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:25,666
Alpha one, we're moving to you,

00:32:25,666 --> 00:32:26,833
we'll let you know when we're inbound.

Copy.

282
00:32:29,791 --> 00:32:31,125
Tommy, you see
where that gun fire came from?

283
00:32:31,541 --> 00:32:34,625
I saw a guy, it shot through the window.

284
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:41,458
I can't find it.

285
00:32:41,875 --> 00:32:42,625
It's in there, bro.

286
00:32:42,666 --> 00:32:43,791
I can't fucking find it, man.

287
00:32:44,958 --> 00:32:48,250
Frogman six, Romeo, Casa Vac is inbound.

00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:05,500
All right, stack

293
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,166
we're moving down.

294
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:10,250
Yes, sir.

295
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:14,041
Sir, I still think
there's dudes on our roof.

296
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:16,416
Yeah, we're gonna
blow claymores as we move, Sam?

297
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:17,125
Yes, sir.

298
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:19,291
Alpha two, be advised,
we'll be blowing claymores.

299
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:21,958
Oh, fuck, I got a bunch of C4 in my bag,

300
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:22,750
I gotta get my shit.

00:33:23,041 --> 00:33:24,333
Yeah, I'm gonna get it.

302
00:33:24,833 --> 00:33:25,583
Sam, Tommy.

303
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:27,750
Let's go.

304
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,166
My shit's to the left.

305
00:33:35,125 --> 00:33:35,875
His gear's in the corner.

306
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:36,958
Copy.

307
00:33:37,458 --> 00:33:37,916
Gotcha.

I got Frank's shit right here.

309
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:40,875
Gosh.

310

How we doing?

311
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:51,041
Yeah, I'm up.

312
00:33:51,208 --> 00:33:51,416
School.

313
00:33:51,791 --> 00:33:52,875
Tommy, I'm me, all right.

314
00:33:55,541 --> 00:33:56,333
All right. That's your kit.

315
00:33:56,708 --> 00:33:57,666
My bag, thanks, Mac.

316
00:33:57,666 --> 00:33:58,166
That's your kit.

317
00:33:58,375 --> 00:33:58,666
We're good.

318
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:01,083
Larry, skimmer some hands.

319
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:01,666
Moving.

320
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:05,083
Clip him in?

321
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:05,750
Yes, sir.

322
00:34:06,916 --> 00:34:07,125
Tommy.

323
00:34:13,166 --> 00:34:14,166
Opie two, this is one.

324
00:34:14,625 --> 00:34:16,083
We are breaking
down, getting ready to move.

325
00:34:16,416 --> 00:34:16,625
Over.

326
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:20,750
Yo, somewhere took me in.

327
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:21,041
Yep.

328
00:34:21,166 --> 00:34:21,583
Tommy, I'm me.

329
00:34:28,916 --> 00:34:31,083
There's an M79 in that room there.

330
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:32,041
Oh, shit, it's mine.

331
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:32,416
Got it?

332
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,875
Sam, sledgehammers, in front of you.

333
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,250
Fuck me, I gotcha.

334
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,166
I gotcha.

335
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,541
Come with behind.

336
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:44,375
You got that?

337
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:44,875
Who's got that?

338
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:46,333
I'll see you right there.

339
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:46,541
Thank you. Yep.

340
00:34:47,166 --> 00:34:47,500
All right.

341
00:34:47,916 --> 00:34:48,500
Hook me up, hook me up.

342
00:34:48,791 --> 00:34:49,000
Yep.

343
00:34:49,916 --> 00:34:51,083
Frank, let me know when we're up on gear.

344
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:52,375
Sir.

345
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:53,625
I need my backpack.

346
00:34:55,708 --> 00:34:57,166
Is there any more
gear in that room, Tommy?

347
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:00,416
Thank you.

348
00:35:02,875 --> 00:35:05,166
How am I?

349
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,875
Right here, brother.

350
00:35:14,916 --> 00:35:15,125
Fuck.

351
00:35:18,666 --> 00:35:28,208
All right, we're all right.

352
00:35:29,416 --> 00:35:29,791
We're up.

353
00:35:30,583 --> 00:35:30,833
Copy.

354
00:35:32,083 --> 00:35:32,583
Go, Mac.

355
00:35:38,875 --> 00:35:40,208
Alpha-2, we're about to blow claymores.

356
00:35:40,833 --> 00:35:41,583
Blow claymores, Sam.

357
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:42,000
Roger.

358
00:35:42,791 --> 00:35:43,333
Find the hole.

359
00:35:47,416 --> 00:35:47,458
Go!

360
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:54,750
Last man.

361
00:36:03,416 --> 00:36:03,875
I got the window.

362
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:07,500
I have the door.

363
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:10,208
That Bushmaster,
your cap back is inbound.

364
00:36:10,208 --> 00:36:11,875
We are at six
minutes from your position over.

365
00:36:12,291 --> 00:36:12,833
Six minutes out.

366
00:36:13,208 --> 00:36:13,791
Copy, Bushmaster.

367
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:14,583
Okay.

368
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:22,041
Alpha-2, we're preparing
to receive Castabak platform.

369
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:23,125
Are you guys broken down yet?

370
00:36:23,875 --> 00:36:24,708
Get one, not yet.

371
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:25,541
Check.

372
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:32,291
All right, here's the breakout plan.

373
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,125
Mac, Laris, you're covering your family.

374
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:35,583
Yes, sir.

375
00:36:36,125 --> 00:36:38,666
When the tank rolls up,
Frank, you're gonna pop smoke.

376
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:39,458
Check.

377
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:40,750
The scouts are gonna lead us out.

378
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:43,916
It's gonna be Tommy, Elliot, Sam,

379
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,416
and I'm bringing up the rear.

380
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:46,833
Ray, you're with me.

381
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,166
Once Elliot is in the tank,

382
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:50,833
we are all coming
back inside the building.

383
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:53,458
All right, do it.

384
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:57,875
You, me.

385
00:37:02,791 --> 00:37:03,541
Tell them no sudden movements.

386
00:37:05,208 --> 00:37:05,708
No talking.

387
00:37:07,666 --> 00:37:09,875
I'll
keep their hands where these men can see them.

388
00:37:13,541 --> 00:37:15,000
Rockman, this is Bushmaster.

389
00:37:15,416 --> 00:37:17,000
Goodbye, we've got to receive you, over.

390
00:37:17,541 --> 00:37:19,541
Bushmaster, we'll
be extracting two packs,

391
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:21,375
exiting out of Metal
Gate directly out of the pressure.

392
00:37:21,916 --> 00:37:23,416
Bushmaster, mark by H-C, over.

393
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:24,250
Back right, Parker.

394
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:26,583
Copy, Rockman, two
packs, Metal Gate, H-C-A,

395
00:37:26,833 --> 00:37:27,333
five minutes over.

396
00:37:27,916 --> 00:37:28,541
Copy, Bushmaster.

397
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:29,750
Five minutes, sir.

398
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,291
All right.

399
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,333
Alpha-2, when the tank
rolls up, we're gonna breakout.

400
00:37:35,416 --> 00:37:36,583
Once we get Elliot evacuated,

401
00:37:36,958 --> 00:37:38,125
we're pulling back to our house.

402
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:39,958
Break.

403
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:41,875
You mean?

404
00:37:42,208 --> 00:37:42,791
What, why?

405
00:37:44,083 --> 00:37:44,541
Sir, why?

406
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:45,583
What is the plan?

407
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:46,750
We need to cover this door.

408
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:49,833
The thing we can do to
facilitate your movement to us.

409
00:37:50,625 --> 00:37:52,458
Just don't fucking
do this when we roll up.

410
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:53,541
You cover this door?

411
00:37:53,541 --> 00:37:54,000
Why, sir?

412
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:55,291
Just do it, okay?

413
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:06,041
She's in.

414
00:38:07,625 --> 00:38:07,833
Hey.

415
00:38:08,375 --> 00:38:10,333
Mack, are we good in there?

416
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:11,375
Yeah, we're good.

417
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:12,750
We're a few minutes out here.

418
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:13,416
Yes, sir.

419
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:14,041
All right.

420
00:38:15,375 --> 00:38:18,583
Hey, find out from me
whether the tank is gonna be left side

421
00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:19,166
or right side.

422
00:38:20,041 --> 00:38:20,375
Yes, sir.

423
00:38:21,791 --> 00:38:23,333
Bushmaster, this is Frogman 6 Romeo.

424
00:38:24,041 --> 00:38:26,041
What side of the gate
will you be landing, over?

425
00:38:27,958 --> 00:38:29,333
How you doing?

426
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,541
Left hand side, left hand side, over.

427
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:32,541
Left hand side, sir.

428
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:33,458
Copy.

429
00:38:35,666 --> 00:38:37,208
Yeah, that fucking
Claymore rocked me, dude.

430
00:38:37,833 --> 00:38:38,625
Fuck, I'm ringing my bell.

431
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:40,916
Do me a favor.

432
00:38:41,916 --> 00:38:42,541
Check on Tommy.

433
00:38:43,666 --> 00:38:44,625
He's pretty close to that grenade.

434
00:38:48,666 --> 00:38:56,875
Elliot, you good?

435
00:38:57,958 --> 00:38:58,166
Good.

436
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,291
I'm good.

437
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:04,000
You okay?

438
00:39:04,833 --> 00:39:05,500
Yeah, let me see.

439
00:39:05,541 --> 00:39:06,000
You're good.

440
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:10,291
Ah, fuck.

441
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,250
We are 10 minutes behind.

442
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,333
I'm able to break out.

443
00:39:19,708 --> 00:39:20,083
Roger that.

444
00:39:21,041 --> 00:39:22,583
Captain made a wear
right here, Steve wanted.

445
00:39:24,125 --> 00:39:25,208
Three mics out, your position.

446
00:39:26,791 --> 00:39:27,416
Copy, Bushmaster.

447
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:29,000
Three mics out.

448
00:39:29,291 --> 00:39:29,833
All right.

449
00:39:30,083 --> 00:39:30,625
If it's only--

450
00:39:30,958 --> 00:39:32,208
Actually, Mrs.
Manny, actually we are Captain.

451
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:35,375
Stop it.

452
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:36,000
What's going on?

453
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:38,833
You are holding security.

454
00:39:38,833 --> 00:39:39,041
Yes.

455
00:39:39,416 --> 00:39:41,083
We are gonna bust
out, go to the Bradley's.

456
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:42,083
I'm gonna get into Bradley's.

457
00:39:42,083 --> 00:39:43,416
You guys are gonna
come back to the house.

458
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,250
Just like before, everything is okay.

459
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,125
All right?

460
00:40:05,375 --> 00:40:07,208
Rockman, Rockman, we are two mics over.

461
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:08,916
Copy that.

462
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:12,458
Two minutes.

463
00:40:13,958 --> 00:40:14,916
Two mics out, pass.

464
00:40:15,291 --> 00:40:16,166
Back, back, Frank.

465
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:18,916
Two minutes.

466
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:19,916
Two minutes.

467
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:21,083
Two people.

468
00:40:21,625 --> 00:40:22,541
Two people, I collect.

469
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:31,458
Tom?

470
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,208
Hey.

471
00:40:45,958 --> 00:40:46,250
God.

472
00:40:47,916 --> 00:40:48,125
Good.

473
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:03,166
Frank, I hear it, prep the smoke.

474
00:41:04,291 --> 00:41:04,708
Smoke's prepped.

475
00:41:06,041 --> 00:41:07,208
Rockman, sick fromia,

476
00:41:07,208 --> 00:41:08,666
help approaching your OP now.

477
00:41:09,541 --> 00:41:09,916
One minute out.

478
00:41:10,791 --> 00:41:11,250
One minute.

479
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:12,625
One minute.

480
00:41:13,041 --> 00:41:13,416
One minute.

481
00:41:15,166 --> 00:41:15,333
Tom?

482
00:41:15,583 --> 00:41:15,791
Yeah.

483
00:41:17,083 --> 00:41:17,458
Yes sir.

484
00:41:26,208 --> 00:41:28,250
All right, Frank, smoke out.

485
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:39,708
Smoke out.

486
00:42:08,041 --> 00:42:10,791
Rockman, we I.T. hear smoke, 36.

487
00:42:17,208 --> 00:42:18,875
Hey, stay in the
stack, stay in the stack.

488
00:42:18,875 --> 00:42:20,625
Wrap it down, wrap it down, wrap it down.

489
00:42:20,833 --> 00:42:21,250
We're gonna go.

490
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,041
Break out, break out, break out.

491
00:42:25,791 --> 00:42:27,125
Go, go, hold up.

492
00:42:42,291 --> 00:42:42,416
Go.

493
00:45:50,166 --> 00:45:50,666
Oh my God.

494
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:54,416
Oh my God, fuck.

495
00:45:56,291 --> 00:45:56,708
Fuck.

496
00:45:59,583 --> 00:46:00,291
Oh my God.

497
00:47:17,791 --> 00:47:19,916
Oh my God.

498
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,250
Oh my God.

499
00:47:25,208 --> 00:47:28,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

500
00:49:01,208 --> 00:49:02,958
Hey, get air.

501
00:49:03,666 --> 00:49:03,875
Sir.

502
00:49:05,541 --> 00:49:06,000
Well, beautiful base.

503
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:08,333
Well, beautiful two six, one platform.

504
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,208
It's available, pushing my paws.

505
00:49:10,625 --> 00:49:11,416
Five zone ETA one.

506
00:49:36,916 --> 00:49:37,791
This is Bushmaster.

507
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:39,583
We are troops in contact.

508
00:49:40,208 --> 00:49:41,916
We just experienced a large IED.

509
00:49:42,666 --> 00:49:43,958
We have the RTV at this time.

510
00:49:44,208 --> 00:49:44,833
How copy?

511
00:49:46,166 --> 00:49:47,541
Bushmaster, this is Manshew.

512
00:49:47,833 --> 00:49:48,916
Solid copy, our troops in contact.

513
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:49,958
What you sit around for?

514
00:49:50,666 --> 00:49:53,708
Yeah, upon arrival,
OV1, we were ramped down

515
00:49:53,708 --> 00:49:54,916
on the course of progress.

516
00:49:55,166 --> 00:49:55,458
In there.

517
00:49:57,958 --> 00:49:59,500
We had a massive IED break.

518
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:02,416
We moved our gunners to some frags.

519
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,166
We're gonna have to our Navy to the cash.

520
00:50:04,166 --> 00:50:05,083
Hey, what on me?

521
00:50:08,125 --> 00:50:10,166
We're gonna need
assistance off loading our casualties.

522
00:50:10,625 --> 00:50:10,791
Over.

523
00:50:12,083 --> 00:50:13,250
Solid copy, our long Bushmaster.

524
00:50:34,625 --> 00:50:38,166
Tommy, what the fuck are you doing?

525
00:50:39,083 --> 00:50:40,250
I need you to help me.

526
00:50:40,583 --> 00:50:41,583
Get the fuck out of here.

527
00:50:42,916 --> 00:50:43,875
We deal with a lot of threats.

528
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:45,500
Hey, can we get some guns up here?

529
00:50:45,833 --> 00:50:47,125
Frogman six, this is five.

530
00:50:47,458 --> 00:50:49,083
Radio jack, face the fire up there.

531
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:49,833
Stand by.

532
00:50:50,083 --> 00:50:51,375
I'll be sending some guns up, chief.

533
00:50:51,666 --> 00:50:52,916
I'll grab you, Master Web,

534
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:54,541
let it out before I'll step right to you.

535
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,958
Me, uh, Bushmaster, copy.

536
00:50:57,208 --> 00:50:59,041
You know, are you
gonna hand me the new one,

537
00:50:59,041 --> 00:50:59,625
Frogman over?

538
00:51:00,125 --> 00:51:01,291
Is that the situation over there?

539
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:02,125
Uh-huh, I think I'll push back.

540
00:51:02,166 --> 00:51:03,958
Hey, sir, what's that thing over here?

541
00:51:04,625 --> 00:51:05,875
Check, check, check.

542
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:07,250
We're gonna have to have a better life.

543
00:51:07,916 --> 00:51:08,416
What's going on?

544
00:51:09,083 --> 00:51:10,250
Stand, understand, break free.

545
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,666
All one, get yourself a new radio jack.

546
00:51:12,708 --> 00:51:13,958
Frogman, this is Bushmaster.

547
00:51:14,333 --> 00:51:16,541
Frogman six, Frogman
five, pass me on the fire.

548
00:51:16,666 --> 00:51:17,333
Let me check my car.

549
00:51:17,916 --> 00:51:18,875
Radio jack, how do you read, Master?

550
00:51:19,333 --> 00:51:20,750
Radio jack, follow over.

551
00:51:20,791 --> 00:51:21,583
Prepare to break down.

552
00:51:22,041 --> 00:51:23,375
Now, I need you to break down.

553
00:51:23,541 --> 00:51:24,541
I need you to push, Master.

554
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:27,083
Negative on comms
with all of the elements.

555
00:51:27,291 --> 00:51:28,208
We are coming to you now.

556
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:29,833
No attempt continues, Lea.

557
00:51:29,875 --> 00:51:31,000
Frogman six, this is five.

558
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,125
I advise that you
attempt it on your end, over.

559
00:51:33,583 --> 00:51:33,750
Status.

560
00:51:34,416 --> 00:51:35,666
Stand by, prior to breaking out,

561
00:51:35,666 --> 00:51:36,875
we either gonna blow those claim words

562
00:51:36,875 --> 00:51:38,000
or we gotta switch them up.

563
00:51:41,166 --> 00:51:54,708
Alpha two, this is one.

564
00:51:55,291 --> 00:51:57,583
We have taken massive casualties.

565
00:51:58,541 --> 00:52:00,666
We're anticipating
a coordinated enemy attack

566
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,416
at our position at any moment.

567
00:52:03,125 --> 00:52:05,833
We need you to collapse to us, time now.

568
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:11,833
Jake, this is one, collapse to us, now.

569
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:14,541
Dragon, but where are you guys?

570
00:52:16,041 --> 00:52:16,541
We're bu--

571
00:52:18,583 --> 00:52:19,583
We're built on.

572
00:52:21,458 --> 00:52:24,125
Look for the blood
and the smoke, we're there.

573
00:52:43,208 --> 00:52:44,000
Tell the ropes, Jake!

574
00:52:44,666 --> 00:52:45,250
What was that?

575
00:52:48,875 --> 00:52:49,083
Fuck.

576
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:53,083
Tell the ropes, Jake!

577
00:52:54,458 --> 00:52:56,000
No, no, don't tell the ropes.

578
00:53:10,916 --> 00:53:14,583
Jake, what's your update?

579
00:53:18,208 --> 00:53:19,708
Alpha one, this is Alpha two.

580
00:53:19,958 --> 00:53:22,166
We're experiencing a
fire from across the street.

581
00:53:23,375 --> 00:53:24,708
We're looking to
try to break out of there

582
00:53:24,708 --> 00:53:25,541
once it gets solved.

583
00:53:25,833 --> 00:53:26,166
Damn right.

584
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:28,375
Copy that, just fucking hurry.

585
00:53:29,666 --> 00:53:30,375
Yeah, we'll go.

586
00:53:43,333 --> 00:53:45,416
Hey, I gotta do blood swing.

587
00:53:50,833 --> 00:53:52,541
Okay, all right, all right.

588
00:53:53,666 --> 00:53:56,583
All right, hell, right here, right here.

589
00:53:56,583 --> 00:53:58,541
Just hang in
there, you're not alone, man.

590
00:54:08,625 --> 00:54:10,750
You're okay, I'm going to blow you off.

591
00:54:17,458 --> 00:54:20,000
Okay, all right, all right, all right.

592
00:54:28,083 --> 00:54:29,125
You're good, all right?

593
00:54:29,291 --> 00:54:29,791
You're good.

594
00:54:37,791 --> 00:54:50,000
All right, I'm gonna go the first one.

595
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:16,416
But I'm gonna give it over
your boot right now, all right?

596
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:19,791
All right, just hold on, just hold on.

597
00:56:22,291 --> 00:56:24,750
Oh man, that's not gonna work, okay?

598
00:56:27,375 --> 00:56:29,041
All right?

599
00:56:29,666 --> 00:56:32,041
Yes sir, yeah, all right, perfect.

600
00:56:32,791 --> 00:56:33,375
Bring this down.

601
00:56:36,416 --> 00:56:38,458
Menchie 6X Ray, this is Frogman 6 Romeo.

602
00:56:43,083 --> 00:56:45,250
Menchie 6X Ray, this is Frogman 6 Romeo.

603
00:56:46,708 --> 00:56:50,083
Oh shit, fuck.

604
00:56:58,541 --> 00:57:05,083
Menchie 6X Ray, this is Frogman 6 Romeo.

605
00:57:05,875 --> 00:57:07,166
We have two severely wounded.

606
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:09,541
We need another cast
effect as soon as possible.

607
00:57:10,375 --> 00:57:12,541
Be advised that IED
caused the injuries, over.

608
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:20,125
You want me to do it?

609
00:57:21,458 --> 00:57:23,000
Okay, all right, okay.

610
00:57:24,083 --> 00:57:25,500
Your legs are stretching me.

611
00:57:28,666 --> 00:57:30,916
Frogman, you are not readable, say again.

612
00:57:31,541 --> 00:57:33,708
Menchie 6X Ray, this is Frogman 6 Romeo.

613
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:35,666
We have two severely wounded.

614
00:57:36,708 --> 00:57:38,750
We need another cast effect, over.

615
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:40,833
Who's the severely wounded?

616
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:41,750
It's me.

617
00:57:42,166 --> 00:57:43,000
No, it's not you.

618
00:57:43,416 --> 00:57:44,958
Menchie 6X, who is it?

619
00:57:46,541 --> 00:57:47,791
Menchie 6X.

620
00:57:49,625 --> 00:57:50,125
Who is it?

621
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:51,208
Menchie 6X.

622
00:57:51,666 --> 00:57:52,250
Menchie 6X.

623
00:57:52,791 --> 00:57:53,291
Menchie 6X.

624
00:57:53,291 --> 00:57:54,750
Hey, hey, we got air back.

625
00:57:55,291 --> 00:57:56,875
We can't do gun runs because the bad guys

626
00:57:56,875 --> 00:57:58,416
are running top of
us, but we can't coordinate

627
00:57:58,416 --> 00:57:59,125
a show of force.

628
00:57:59,458 --> 00:58:00,375
Do you want me to do it?

629
00:58:01,041 --> 00:58:01,375
Do it.

630
00:58:02,875 --> 00:58:05,250
Profane 5X, wild
eagle 2-4, we need an immediate

631
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:08,125
show of force over our
position, over our position.

632
00:58:08,458 --> 00:58:11,333
OP-1, from south
to north, how copy, over.

633
00:58:12,375 --> 00:58:14,625
Affirm, wild eagle 2-4, show of force,

634
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:16,958
south to north, inbound 30 seconds.

635
00:58:18,541 --> 00:58:19,208
Sweetie, through.

636
00:58:19,666 --> 00:58:20,375
Guys, I need more gas.

637
00:58:20,916 --> 00:58:22,583
Yeah, yeah.

638
00:58:35,166 --> 00:58:37,583
Oh, fuck.

639
00:58:57,416 --> 00:59:01,416
Hey, hey, Fletcher, hey, Fletcher.

640
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:11,000
What the fuck is Frank doing?

641
00:59:12,625 --> 00:59:13,750
Frank, Frank.

642
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,958
Lock the fucking
stairwell down, this guy's up there.

643
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:23,625
Hey, bro, I need you
to take over comms from me,

644
00:59:23,625 --> 00:59:24,000
you got it?

645
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:24,750
Got you.

646
00:59:26,541 --> 00:59:28,875
Wild eagle base, wild
eagle 2-6, request you relay

647
00:59:28,875 --> 00:59:31,666
to Manchu X-ray,
we're receiving small arms,

648
00:59:31,666 --> 00:59:34,166
fire, grenades, we
have two severely wounded,

649
00:59:34,166 --> 00:59:34,958
we need air support over.

650
00:59:43,083 --> 00:59:44,583
Just stop, just stop, just stop.

651
00:59:45,083 --> 00:59:46,791
Please, please, please.

652
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:54,500
Stop, please, exactly.

653
00:59:54,708 --> 00:59:55,875
We gotta put a tourniquet on you.

654
00:59:55,875 --> 00:59:56,125
All right.

655
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:03,750
Alpha 1, this is Alpha
2, what's your Z-rep over there?

656
01:00:04,166 --> 01:00:05,541
We're treating Ellie and Sam right now.

657
01:00:05,916 --> 01:00:08,750
We advise possible
multiple mams on our rooftop.

658
01:00:09,916 --> 01:00:11,458
Roger that, we're taking effective fire

659
01:00:11,458 --> 01:00:14,208
from across the street,
we're 200 meters to your east.

660
01:00:16,041 --> 01:00:18,541
Stand by for a DTA and our side.

661
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:19,750
Roger that.

662
01:00:20,541 --> 01:00:20,875
Come on.

663
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:40,041
Hey, I'm gonna do
something that's gonna hurt.

664
01:00:40,583 --> 01:00:41,666
I can't put the tourniquet on,

665
01:00:41,666 --> 01:00:43,000
I need to apply pressure another way.

666
01:01:32,166 --> 01:01:33,625
Okay, okay, okay.

667
01:01:38,583 --> 01:01:41,541
I need morphine, I need morphine.

668
01:01:43,791 --> 01:01:46,125
There's no morphine.

669
01:01:46,166 --> 01:01:46,958
Jake, where are you guys?

670
01:01:47,333 --> 01:01:47,708
We're gonna walk out.

671
01:01:48,208 --> 01:01:50,375
Alpha 1, this is Alpha

672
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:51,375
Guys.

We're now 100 meters

674
01:01:56,625 --> 01:01:59,708
Now we're still on

676
01:02:00,708 --> 01:02:01,875
We're about two minutes out.

677
01:02:01,875 --> 01:02:03,458
We're looking at a coordinated attack.

678
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,791

679
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:12,500
Okay, I don't know where the morphine is.

680
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:15,000
It's in my bag, it's in
my bag, it's in the medic bag.

681
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,166
What, is it in the medic bag?

682
01:02:17,125 --> 01:02:17,708
It's in the pocket.

683
01:02:18,083 --> 01:02:19,958
Okay, I've gotta get,

Ah, shoot, shoot, shoot.

689
01:02:37,916 --> 01:02:41,500
Sir, hey, you fucked up?

690
01:02:42,666 --> 01:02:47,875
I did it upside down, I
did it in my, in my own thumb.

691
01:02:48,291 --> 01:02:49,291
You all right though, you good?

692
01:02:49,333 --> 01:02:51,666
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.

693
01:02:51,666 --> 01:02:55,125
Bro, bro, bro, bro,

694
01:02:55,125 --> 01:02:56,041
there's more in there.

695
01:02:56,416 --> 01:02:56,625
Right.

696
01:02:57,958 --> 01:03:01,791
Get another one out.

697
01:03:05,708 --> 01:03:06,333
Oh, fuck.

698
01:03:09,916 --> 01:03:11,875
I'm pushing your whole mission up,

699
01:03:11,875 --> 01:03:14,916

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

701
01:03:16,875 --> 01:03:18,000
Okay, it's coming, it's coming.

702
01:03:18,583 --> 01:03:19,541
I'm just trying to.

703
01:03:30,208 --> 01:03:32,875
Elliot, he's in your
arm right now, all right?

704
01:03:33,416 --> 01:03:35,583

707
01:03:39,791 --> 01:03:40,583
You can't have more.

708
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:42,791
Please, not enough, I'm
telling you it's not enough.

709
01:03:42,791 --> 01:03:44,041
I'm telling you, you're good.

710
01:03:44,625 --> 01:03:46,625
You're not even the
one we're worried about, okay?

711
01:04:09,125 --> 01:04:11,750
Wild Eagle Base, Profane 5-6, we,

712

All youSSians!

779
01:08:12,833 --> 01:08:14,000
I got no blood on my hand right now.

780
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:14,916
Shit.

781

All right, check it out.

782
01:08:19,083 --> 01:08:20,666
We got multiple leg injuries here.

783
01:08:21,166 --> 01:08:21,916
I need morphine.

784
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:22,958
Gaws.

785
01:08:23,458 --> 01:08:24,458

We got dudes on our roof.

790
01:08:33,583 --> 01:08:35,083
We need to get these
guys the fuck out of here now.

791
01:08:35,333 --> 01:08:36,416
Have you called for Casa back?

792
01:08:37,291 --> 01:08:38,208
I can't punch out from here.

793
01:08:39,625 --> 01:08:40,416
Go, get up there.

794
01:08:42,583 --> 01:08:43,250
Zowie, go.

795
01:08:47,416 --> 01:08:48,041
Can you make arms?

796
01:08:48,416 --> 01:08:49,333
Yes, sir.

797
01:08:53,041 --> 01:08:55,583
Sir, has anyone
looked at you, checked you out?

798
01:08:56,208 --> 01:08:56,708
Hey, take a knee.

799
01:08:56,708 --> 01:08:57,166
Take a knee.

800
01:08:57,166 --> 01:08:57,458
Take a knee.

801
01:09:00,083 --> 01:09:01,875
Has anyone looked at you?

802
01:09:03,291 --> 01:09:04,125
Let me do a blood sweep.

803
01:09:04,416 --> 01:09:06,166
Manchu X-ray, this is Frog Map 5.

804
01:09:06,416 --> 01:09:07,333
Romeo, be advised.

805

808
01:09:12,666 --> 01:09:14,416
Is it Casa back
platform coming back here?

809
01:09:16,291 --> 01:09:17,791
How calls have been made?

810
01:09:18,291 --> 01:09:21,500
Dude, I'm fucked up.

811
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:25,291
I'm gonna need you to run point.

812
01:09:29,291 --> 01:09:30,000
What's going on up there?

813
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:32,791
All right, we got
grenades stolen in this room over here.

814
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:35,791
We probably got--
probably got dudes on our roof still.

815
01:09:36,375 --> 01:09:36,583
Okay.

816
01:09:37,166 --> 01:09:39,000
This is the external
door straight ahead, all right?

817
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:39,208
Yeah.

818
01:09:39,333 --> 01:09:39,666
Help me.

819
01:09:40,125 --> 01:09:40,750
Hey, Sabam, with you.

820
01:09:41,041 --> 01:09:42,000
All right, I'll get it to you.

821
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:42,333
Let's go.

822
01:09:52,708 --> 01:09:55,000
Hitting both of his
legs is-- hitting his arm.

823
01:09:55,416 --> 01:09:57,666
He's got abable wounds in
him, and he's lost a lot of blood.

824
01:09:57,666 --> 01:09:57,875
Okay.

825
01:09:58,125 --> 01:10:00,791
And there's
something burning inside of him.

826
01:10:00,791 --> 01:10:02,875
Yeah, that's
phosphorus. It's all over its side.

827
01:10:03,541 --> 01:10:03,833
All right.

828
01:10:04,375 --> 01:10:04,833
Can you breathe?

829
01:10:05,333 --> 01:10:05,541
Hey.

830
01:10:07,375 --> 01:10:07,833
Yeah.

831
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:08,916
Oh, hey.

832
01:10:09,083 --> 01:10:09,833
You're good.

833
01:10:10,166 --> 01:10:11,541
Did you guys hear me with that morphine?

834
01:10:13,041 --> 01:10:13,916
Yeah, I gave you the morphine.

835
01:10:14,375 --> 01:10:15,083
I gave you the morphine, man.

836
01:10:15,125 --> 01:10:17,750
A few minutes ago,
right before you got here.

837
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:18,791
You just do it in my arm,

838
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,750
because I got
shaved blood return in my leg.

839
01:10:22,166 --> 01:10:22,791
Yeah, in your arm, man.

840
01:10:23,458 --> 01:10:24,708
I did it right in your arm.

841
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,125
Move, move, move, move!

842
01:10:28,708 --> 01:10:29,791
Let's go, boys!

843
01:10:30,291 --> 01:10:31,541
Let's fucking do this!

844
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:32,958
Hey!

845
01:10:34,125 --> 01:10:35,375
I know we're moving fast.

846
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:37,541
We don't step on anyone's fucking legs.

847
01:10:37,791 --> 01:10:38,583
All right, Sammy, let's go.

848
01:10:39,541 --> 01:10:39,958
Relax, man.

849
01:10:40,458 --> 01:10:41,916
My man, let's do this! Come on!

850
01:10:43,166 --> 01:10:44,083
Fuck with him!

851
01:10:53,083 --> 01:10:55,041
All right, guys, listen up.

852
01:10:56,166 --> 01:10:57,541
Everybody shut the fuck up.

853
01:10:57,541 --> 01:10:57,958
Eyes on me.

854
01:10:58,958 --> 01:11:00,000
Start doing a re-org.

855
01:11:00,541 --> 01:11:01,333
Prepare for breakout.

856
01:11:01,958 --> 01:11:03,500
We're gonna get these guys cast back.

857
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:04,083
Yes, sir!

858
01:11:04,958 --> 01:11:05,708
Yes, sir!

859
01:11:09,875 --> 01:11:10,083
Damn.

860
01:11:13,083 --> 01:11:14,250
Go, Brock.

861
01:11:15,125 --> 01:11:15,791
Yo, what's up, Frank?

862
01:11:15,875 --> 01:11:16,916
You got ammo for the gunners upstairs?

863
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:17,916
Yeah, outside pocket.

864
01:11:21,458 --> 01:11:22,833
I want four brothers over here.

865
01:11:23,208 --> 01:11:25,166
Two for a cast back, two for extraction.

866
01:11:25,708 --> 01:11:28,166
I want the cast backs on
either side of the front gate.

867
01:11:28,583 --> 01:11:29,666
Brad one will be right.

868
01:11:30,041 --> 01:11:31,000
Brad two left.

869
01:11:31,375 --> 01:11:31,666
Yes, sir.

870
01:11:36,791 --> 01:11:37,875
Hey, lock down the windows.

871
01:11:43,166 --> 01:11:47,083
Thank you.

872
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:10,166
This is Frogman 5, Romeo.

873
01:12:10,458 --> 01:12:14,291
We need a cast evac
from OP1 building for Bradley's.

874
01:12:14,583 --> 01:12:16,875
Two for cast evac
of two severely wounded.

875
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:17,708
Break.

876
01:12:18,875 --> 01:12:19,750
Stay in there, Rode.

877
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:20,041
You're good.

878
01:12:20,958 --> 01:12:21,208
Relax.

879
01:12:21,958 --> 01:12:23,041
Hey, it's fucking good, man.

880
01:12:23,041 --> 01:12:23,916
It's a fucking paper cut.

881
01:12:24,208 --> 01:12:25,500
You're a fucking frog man, Sam.

882
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:26,916
You're a fucking frog man.

883
01:12:26,916 --> 01:12:27,333
Let's go.

884
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:28,208
Let's go.

885
01:12:28,750 --> 01:12:29,333
Fuckin' man.

886
01:12:29,333 --> 01:12:30,375
Frogman, Badger.

887
01:12:31,125 --> 01:12:33,541
You are denied
Bradley cast evac due to IED,

888
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,083
small arm start in the AO.

889
01:12:38,708 --> 01:12:39,666
I'll copy. Over.

890
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:40,875
Solid copy. Stand by.

891
01:12:44,458 --> 01:12:44,625
Sir?

892
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:47,833
We're waiting on brigade approval.

893
01:12:48,666 --> 01:12:49,250
What the fuck?

894
01:12:50,208 --> 01:12:50,958
He's the last tanks.

895
01:12:51,875 --> 01:12:52,541
They're fucked up.

896
01:12:53,208 --> 01:12:54,625
So they won't send the cast evac.

897
01:12:55,333 --> 01:12:56,750
Unless the CO gives the thumbs up.

898
01:13:00,083 --> 01:13:02,125
We gotta get him out of here, sir.

899
01:13:05,083 --> 01:13:06,458
You've gotta be the CO.

900
01:13:06,916 --> 01:13:08,208
Sir, stay back.

901
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,041
Radio them right now.

902
01:13:10,583 --> 01:13:11,333
Say you're the CO.

903
01:13:11,916 --> 01:13:13,875
Give them the order
to send the fucking brats.

904
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:18,791
Roger that.

905
01:13:22,291 --> 01:13:23,333
Hey, Tommy, lock it down.

906
01:13:24,041 --> 01:13:24,625
Yes, sir.

907
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:26,208
Hey.

908
01:13:28,125 --> 01:13:28,458
What happened?

909
01:13:29,916 --> 01:13:30,291
Oh, no.

910
01:13:30,916 --> 01:13:31,625
It was an IED, what?

911
01:13:33,083 --> 01:13:33,958
Don't fucking know, huh?

912
01:13:38,625 --> 01:13:39,791
Get the fuck out of here.

913
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:40,333
Yeah.

914
01:13:44,625 --> 01:13:46,500
Manchu X-ray, this is Manchu 6.

915
01:13:46,708 --> 01:13:48,333
I authorize Bushmaster.

916
01:13:48,583 --> 01:13:49,500
I'll copy. Over.

917
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:51,333
Hey, firm.

918
01:13:52,375 --> 01:13:53,708
Manchu 6, break.

919
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:56,916
Broad man, five room.

920
01:13:56,916 --> 01:13:59,958
You'll be ready to
receive Bushmaster on 7-5-5.

921
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:00,875
I'll copy. Over.

922
01:14:01,666 --> 01:14:03,875
Wilco, Bushmaster 7-5-5.

923
01:14:06,458 --> 01:14:08,333
Bushmaster has
approved a maneuver to her position.

924
01:14:10,041 --> 01:14:11,750
Mikey, Brian, give
me an update on the roof.

925
01:14:13,125 --> 01:14:14,708
Take the effect you better be firing.

926
01:14:14,708 --> 01:14:16,166
Multiple backyards at the rooftops.

927
01:14:25,083 --> 01:14:26,583
Bushmaster has approved.

928
01:14:26,791 --> 01:14:27,791
I'll give you a shot. You okay?

929
01:14:28,125 --> 01:14:28,500
Let me know.

930
01:14:28,666 --> 01:14:28,958
You good?

931
01:14:29,125 --> 01:14:29,625
Yeah, I'm good.

932
01:14:30,125 --> 01:14:30,833
You got a rug in there?

933
01:14:31,083 --> 01:14:32,458
Mm-hmm.

934
01:14:32,458 --> 01:14:32,916
Here, kid.

935
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:34,208
Right here.

936
01:14:35,166 --> 01:14:35,541
Here, kid.

937
01:14:35,791 --> 01:14:36,208
Got it.

938
01:14:39,625 --> 01:14:40,500
Are you all up on gear?

939
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:42,958
Hey, James, get out there.

940
01:14:44,083 --> 01:14:44,833
There's gear in the street.

941
01:14:49,041 --> 01:14:49,625
Join with me.

942
01:15:01,083 --> 01:15:14,750
Get away!

943
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:18,500
Fuck! Relax! Relax!

944
01:15:18,958 --> 01:15:20,625
Relax! Relax!

945
01:15:20,875 --> 01:15:21,083
Relax!

946
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:21,541
Fuck!

947
01:15:22,375 --> 01:15:22,708
Get away!

948
01:15:29,541 --> 01:15:30,666
Broadway's are four minutes out.

949
01:15:31,041 --> 01:15:31,750
You got four bikes.

950
01:15:32,375 --> 01:15:33,125
You got four bikes.

951
01:15:33,791 --> 01:15:34,000
Yeah.

952
01:15:35,708 --> 01:15:39,458
Hey, push me! Get out of there!

953
01:15:41,541 --> 01:15:43,375
We got it off! It's fucking rooftop!

954
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:49,208
Get away!

955
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:51,875
Get back! Get back!

956
01:16:03,041 --> 01:16:04,875
Get away!

957
01:16:06,375 --> 01:16:07,375
Get away!

958
01:16:12,083 --> 01:16:13,958
Ah, motherfucker!

959
01:16:15,291 --> 01:16:15,958
What's going on?

960
01:16:16,208 --> 01:16:17,875
Catch the big inbound. I need a 5W.

961
01:16:18,666 --> 01:16:20,416
Had to suck back,
unable to hold position.

962
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:22,083
We got multiple bad guys
trying to get to our position.

963
01:16:22,125 --> 01:16:23,083
Sir?

964
01:16:23,708 --> 01:16:25,083
Sir, I'm calling in to show a force.

965
01:16:25,708 --> 01:16:27,041
Profane 565-7, wide range.

966
01:16:27,041 --> 01:16:31,583
When the Bradley's get here,
Mac, Aaron, Tommy, you grab Elliott.

967
01:16:31,875 --> 01:16:33,166
You guys are going to go out first.

968
01:16:33,458 --> 01:16:36,000
You're going to go
into Brad 1, right hand side.

969
01:16:36,416 --> 01:16:37,333
Right hand side, check.

970
01:16:37,583 --> 01:16:41,125
Brake, grab Sam, Brad 2, left side.

971
01:16:41,625 --> 01:16:41,958
Got it.

972
01:16:42,208 --> 01:16:42,916
Three minutes out!

973
01:16:43,541 --> 01:16:44,000
Three minutes!

974
01:16:57,083 --> 01:16:59,541
Hey, hey, I got his legs, I got his arms.

975
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:00,375
Yeah, let's get him ready.

976
01:17:00,625 --> 01:17:01,750
All right, let's get the shit straight.

977
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:02,250
Get that leg.

978
01:17:03,333 --> 01:17:04,833
All right, we're
getting the fuck out of here.

979
01:17:05,125 --> 01:17:06,250
Come on, give me your hand, brother.

980
01:17:06,875 --> 01:17:07,791
All right, watch this.

981
01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:09,166
We're going to get
the fuck out of here, okay?

982
01:17:09,666 --> 01:17:10,708
All right, come on.

983
01:17:10,708 --> 01:17:11,916
Right here, right here.

984
01:17:12,208 --> 01:17:12,916
Right here.

985
01:17:13,166 --> 01:17:14,041
Okay, okay, okay.

986
01:17:14,291 --> 01:17:15,000
Tommy, let's fold him, okay?

987
01:17:15,541 --> 01:17:16,416
Tommy, on you.

988
01:17:16,416 --> 01:17:17,291
We're going to fold him your way.

989
01:17:17,666 --> 01:17:18,208
Oh, my God.

990
01:17:18,791 --> 01:17:19,583
You guys, you're going to need me.

991
01:17:19,583 --> 01:17:20,541
You got to be in there real fast.

992
01:17:20,875 --> 01:17:21,083
Yeah, we will.

993
01:17:21,125 --> 01:17:22,375
All right.

994
01:17:22,375 --> 01:17:23,166
Hold on.

995
01:17:23,541 --> 01:17:23,958
All right.

996
01:17:24,541 --> 01:17:25,250
All right.

997
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:25,500
All my count.

998
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:26,541
All right.

999
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,083
All right, all three.

1000
01:17:28,541 --> 01:17:29,708
One, two, three.

1001
01:17:31,791 --> 01:17:33,666
Okay, come on, come on.

1002
01:17:33,958 --> 01:17:35,041
One, two, three.

1003
01:17:35,416 --> 01:17:35,708
You good?

1004
01:17:36,041 --> 01:17:36,375
You ready?

1005
01:17:36,416 --> 01:17:36,791
Set him down.

1006
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:38,500
All right.

1007
01:17:38,875 --> 01:17:39,250
You good?

1008
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:39,458
You good?

1009
01:17:40,250 --> 01:17:41,916
Other side, we got this.

1010
01:17:41,916 --> 01:17:42,416
All right.

1011
01:17:43,166 --> 01:17:44,083
One, two, three.

1012
01:17:45,666 --> 01:17:46,125
All right.

1013
01:17:46,583 --> 01:17:46,833
All right.

1014
01:17:48,083 --> 01:17:50,083
Two minutes out!

1015
01:17:50,083 --> 01:17:50,750
Two minutes! Two minutes!

1016
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:51,916
Two minutes!

1017
01:17:52,166 --> 01:17:52,416
All right.

1018
01:17:53,083 --> 01:17:53,708
M-I-3, two, one.

1019
01:17:56,083 --> 01:17:57,333
Bro, you're doing great.

1020
01:17:58,166 --> 01:17:58,750
You hear that?

1021
01:17:58,750 --> 01:17:59,791
Those are in my fucking arm.

1022
01:18:00,166 --> 01:18:00,750
Don't worry, bro.

1023
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:01,541
Your arm is still attached.

1024
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:02,500
It's right here.

1025
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:03,500
I got it.

1026
01:18:06,083 --> 01:18:06,916
Two minutes out!

1027
01:18:07,375 --> 01:18:08,000
Two minutes!

1028
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:17,375
Hey, you got to get ready, man.

1029
01:18:17,375 --> 01:18:17,875
This is going to hurt.

1030
01:18:17,875 --> 01:18:18,333
No, no, no.

1031
01:18:19,125 --> 01:18:20,416
No other way, man.

1032
01:18:20,416 --> 01:18:21,666
There's no other way we got to do it.

1033
01:18:22,916 --> 01:18:24,125
BTF up, bro!

1034
01:18:25,833 --> 01:18:27,500
Which side are we getting Elliot out of?

1035
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:28,208
Elliot?

1036
01:18:30,583 --> 01:18:31,000
Inbound!

1037
01:18:31,291 --> 01:18:31,500
Inbound!

1038
01:18:40,083 --> 01:18:42,375
Elliot, right
side, same on the west side.

1039
01:18:42,666 --> 01:18:43,083
Elliot, right.

1040
01:18:43,208 --> 01:18:43,416
Roger.

1041
01:18:43,875 --> 01:18:44,708
One minute out!

1042
01:18:44,958 --> 01:18:45,458
One minute!

1043
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:47,791
All right.

1044
01:18:49,083 --> 01:18:52,125
Tommy, Frank, you
two are breaking us out.

1045
01:18:52,125 --> 01:18:52,875
Yes, sir.

1046
01:18:53,375 --> 01:18:55,250
Gunners, you'll set up
security out on the street.

1047
01:18:58,083 --> 01:18:59,125
Frank, you straight?

1048
01:18:59,708 --> 01:18:59,916
Good.

1049
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:00,916
I'm going to button hook right.

1050
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:01,958
I'll copy that.

1051
01:19:02,583 --> 01:19:03,291
I'm taking the right breath.

1052
01:19:04,083 --> 01:19:04,666
Hello, man.

1053
01:19:04,666 --> 01:19:05,458
This is Bushmaster.

1054
01:19:05,791 --> 01:19:07,750
We are approaching only one at this time.

1055
01:19:12,083 --> 01:19:14,208
Frank, Tommy, you good?

1056
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:15,083
Bro! You got me?

1057
01:19:15,083 --> 01:19:15,750
Break out of here.

1058
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:16,916
Eyes on me and only me.

1059
01:19:17,125 --> 01:19:18,166
All right. We're good.

1060
01:19:18,416 --> 01:19:18,708
We're good.

1061
01:19:19,541 --> 01:19:20,458
Riley, they're here.

1062
01:19:23,250 --> 01:19:25,166
All right.

1063
01:19:25,875 --> 01:19:26,833
Let's get them on three.

1064
01:19:27,416 --> 01:19:29,208
Three, two, one.

1065
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:32,083
Wrap
down, wrap down, wrap down.

1066
01:19:32,083 --> 01:19:32,333
Break down.

1067
01:19:33,083 --> 01:19:33,541
Break out, break out.

1068
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:38,666
I'm stuck.

1069
01:19:39,041 --> 01:19:39,833
My brother's moved.

1070
01:19:40,291 --> 01:19:41,208
One, two, three.

1071
01:19:41,375 --> 01:19:42,708
Up, up, up.

1072
01:19:48,083 --> 01:19:50,125
Move, bro. Move, go, go, go.

1073
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:56,916
Move!

1074
01:19:59,083 --> 01:20:00,000
All right, Riley.

1075
01:20:00,375 --> 01:20:02,833
One, two, three.

1076
01:20:08,083 --> 01:20:09,666
Come on, brother.

1077
01:20:09,666 --> 01:20:10,041
We got you.

1078
01:20:14,083 --> 01:20:15,083
Let's go.

1079
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:16,083
Move, move.

1080
01:20:16,083 --> 01:20:17,833
Come on.

1081
01:20:17,833 --> 01:20:18,583
Take me.

1082
01:20:20,041 --> 01:20:20,250
Move.

1083
01:20:27,166 --> 01:20:27,583
One more.

1084
01:20:31,916 --> 01:20:36,625
Get the fuck out of here.

1085
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:37,333
Fucking crap.

1086
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:39,000
Put your fire.

1087
01:20:41,333 --> 01:20:42,208
Man, I'm getting you.

1088
01:20:46,291 --> 01:20:47,708
Move, move, move, move.

1089
01:20:52,833 --> 01:20:56,416
Wake up, wake up.

1090
01:20:56,416 --> 01:20:57,916
Get the hell out of here.

1091
01:20:57,916 --> 01:20:58,125
Fuck.

1092
01:20:58,541 --> 01:20:59,666
You all right? Yeah.

1093
01:20:59,666 --> 01:21:00,625
You all right? Yeah.

1094
01:21:01,291 --> 01:21:02,250
I thought you were hit.

1095
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:03,625
I was just hit.

1096
01:21:05,083 --> 01:21:06,250
Let's go, let's go.

1097
01:21:06,958 --> 01:21:08,208
Yes, man, yes, man.

1098
01:21:12,083 --> 01:21:14,083
Hey, come on, man. Get it up.

1099
01:21:14,083 --> 01:21:16,708
I didn't make it out.
I'm stuck in the Bradley, over.

1100
01:21:56,083 --> 01:21:58,875
Profane says the
guys are moving to our booth.

1101
01:21:58,875 --> 01:22:00,958
They're telling us to get
the guys off the roof right now.

1102
01:22:01,375 --> 01:22:02,458
Do we still have guys up there?

1103
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,625
Who asked guys up
there? They're right on us.

1104
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:10,208
Zowie, you hold
security and lock it down.

1105
01:22:10,791 --> 01:22:11,000
Check.

1106
01:22:11,708 --> 01:22:12,083
Listen up.

1107
01:22:12,125 --> 01:22:15,291
I'm gonna have the Brawleys take
off the second floor of this building.

1108
01:22:15,958 --> 01:22:18,083
Gunners, you're holding
security out on the street for extract.

1109
01:22:18,416 --> 01:22:19,541
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

1110
01:22:19,541 --> 01:22:22,041
Mack, I want to show a
force for when that happens.

1111
01:22:22,041 --> 01:22:23,458
Yes, sir. Sergeant. Yeah.

1112
01:22:24,041 --> 01:22:25,375
First semester, one-one.

1113
01:22:25,375 --> 01:22:27,291
We need you to fire at
the top deck of our building.

1114
01:22:27,583 --> 01:22:30,000
We have enemy on our
building and all surrounding buildings.

1115
01:22:31,291 --> 01:22:33,250
Say again, fire at the door building.

1116
01:22:34,208 --> 01:22:37,291
Got a full head count.
Fire into our building. Top deck.

1117
01:22:38,041 --> 01:22:39,083
Zowie, get the fuck down here.

1118
01:22:39,125 --> 01:22:42,708
Negative. Fire may not yet do that.

1119
01:22:42,708 --> 01:22:46,125
The top deck is
fucking clear. Fire into it.

1120
01:22:46,416 --> 01:22:47,583
Here's your... I'll give you...

1121
01:22:47,625 --> 01:22:49,250
I'll give you... I'll give you...

1122
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:51,083
I'll give you... I'll give you...

1123
01:22:51,166 --> 01:22:53,333
Roger that. Stand by.

1124
01:22:54,250 --> 01:22:55,666
Go on out. Fuck it, fuck off!

1125
01:22:55,708 --> 01:22:56,500
Let's go! Let's go!

1126
01:22:59,291 --> 01:23:00,083
Get down, get down, get down!

1127
01:23:26,791 --> 01:23:27,250
Come on, boys!

1128
01:23:29,583 --> 01:23:34,791
Watch out, dude!

1129
01:23:40,083 --> 01:23:42,125
Look at the... Break it out, Isaac!

1130
01:23:43,083 --> 01:23:44,708
Let's move! Let her's up!

1131
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:49,041
Front man, bush
master, shifting fire. Go to hot.

1132
01:24:04,291 --> 01:24:06,041
Why? It's a vessel left in the fifth.

1133
01:24:06,083 --> 01:24:07,458
It's a Hazar. Why?

1134
01:24:08,125 --> 01:24:08,541
I'll give it to you. Why?

1135
01:24:08,708 --> 01:24:09,250
I'll give it to you. Why?

1136
01:24:11,250 --> 01:24:14,250
I'll give it to you. Inbound, inbound!

1137
01:24:18,083 --> 01:24:18,708
Stand by!

1138
01:24:24,583 --> 01:24:27,083
Break out, break out!

1139
01:24:47,083 --> 01:24:48,625
One, two...

1140
01:24:51,125 --> 01:24:52,416
Get in there! Three...

1141
01:24:55,083 --> 01:24:56,791
Back man! Move in!

1142
01:24:59,083 --> 01:25:00,000
Let's go!

1143
01:25:02,250 --> 01:25:02,916
Go!

1144
01:25:08,125 --> 01:25:10,541
The fucking ramp up!

1145
01:26:03,083 --> 01:26:04,458
Let's go see them.

1146
01:27:23,833 --> 01:27:29,875
I didn't think you were going to make it.

1147
01:27:29,875 --> 01:27:31,083
I lost so much.
