5
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,934
This one, Mommy.

6
00:00:54,066 --> 00:00:55,333
This is what I want
for Christmas.

7
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,633
Put that away.
I'll come back.

8
00:00:57,767 --> 00:00:58,600
Okay.

9
00:01:00,734 --> 00:01:02,166
So you know what,

10
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,300
I think this little guy
needs to take a nap.

11
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:07,333
What's your name?

12
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:08,333
Charlotte.

13
00:01:08,467 --> 00:01:09,367
Charlotte,

14
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,166
so should I tell Santa

15
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,433
that this is what
you really want for Christmas?

16
00:01:13,567 --> 00:01:15,066
You know Santa?

17
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,367
Can you keep a secret?

18
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,000
Good, because I'm really
not supposed to tell anyone,

19
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:22,700
but Santa is actually
a personal friend of mine.

20
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:23,600
He is?

21
00:01:23,734 --> 00:01:24,967
He is,

22
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,000
and, you know, he calls me
every time this year

23
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:28,000
asking me

24
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:29,200
what all the good girls
and the good boys

25
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:31,333
want for Christmas.

26
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:32,400
So, have you been good
this year?

27
00:01:32,533 --> 00:01:33,967
Because I kinda
have to report back to him.

28
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,333
I've been good.

29
00:01:35,467 --> 00:01:36,467
You have?

30
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,934
That's wonderful.

31
00:01:38,066 --> 00:01:40,367
Santa's going to be
so happy to hear that.

32
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:42,533
Can I?

33
00:01:44,633 --> 00:01:45,633
-Thank you.
-There you go.

34
00:01:47,633 --> 00:01:49,100
You're wonderful with kids.

35
00:01:49,233 --> 00:01:51,000
You must have some of your own.

36
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:53,433
Not yet,
but hopefully soon.

37
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:54,767
Henry, My fiancÃ©, and I

38
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,967
we own this shop together,

39
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,967
and he loves kids.

40
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,200
If it were up to him,
we'd have a baker's dozen.

41
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:01,567
And how do you feel
about that?

42
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,767
It's definitely negotiable.

43
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,033
This sweater is so beautiful.

44
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:10,000
You know, Nicole made that.

45
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:11,834
Well, if you happen to have
one in my size,

46
00:02:11,967 --> 00:02:13,367
make sure Santa puts one
under the tree for me.

47
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,500
Thank you.

48
00:02:14,633 --> 00:02:16,367
That is very kind of you to say,

49
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,433
but, really,
it's just more of a hobby.

50
00:02:18,567 --> 00:02:19,533
Well, let me know

51
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:21,266
if you ever decide
to make sweaters for people.

52
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,400
I own a store, Unique Styles.

53
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:25,600
I know my customers
would love your work.

54
00:02:25,734 --> 00:02:26,900
Here's my card.

55
00:02:27,033 --> 00:02:27,867
Thank you,

56
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,100
Something to think about.

57
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:30,066
See you tomorrow.

58
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,367
See ya.

59
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,333
Come on, Charlotte, time to go.

60
00:02:33,467 --> 00:02:34,266
Bye, Charlotte.

61
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,533
-Bye!
-See ya.

62
00:02:40,867 --> 00:02:43,767
What do you think,
Jack Frost?

63
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,200
You think I could make a living
selling my designs?

64
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,600
-Hmm?

65
00:02:48,734 --> 00:02:50,867
Yeah, it's a crazy idea.

66
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:07,300
Hey there, my future wife.

67
00:03:07,433 --> 00:03:08,834
Hello, future husband.

68
00:03:08,967 --> 00:03:10,934
How'd we do today?

69
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,066
Uh, good. Busy.

70
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,100
We even sold the giraffe.

71
00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:15,166
-Which one?
-Tall guy.

72
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,133
Gonna miss that big guy.

73
00:03:16,266 --> 00:03:17,400
Oh, he's going to a good home.

74
00:03:17,533 --> 00:03:19,133
Uh, you got our sweaters?

75
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:20,300
Yes.

76
00:03:21,533 --> 00:03:22,400
Just finished them today.

77
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:23,467
Ah-hah.

78
00:03:25,367 --> 00:03:26,834
Oh, they're beautiful.

79
00:03:26,967 --> 00:03:28,066
You do realize

80
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,767
that we're going
to an ugly sweater party,

81
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,667
though, right?

82
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,066
Yeah, that is why

83
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,567
I made the proportions
from the eyes to the bill

84
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,333
completely off, you see?

85
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:37,567
-Yeah, no--
-Kinda ugly, right?

86
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,500
Yeah, I see that.

87
00:03:38,633 --> 00:03:40,500
They're... hideous.

88
00:03:40,633 --> 00:03:41,600
You know, this could actually
be the year

89
00:03:41,734 --> 00:03:42,633
that we win this thing.

90
00:03:42,767 --> 00:03:44,400
Yeah, that's not
going to happen.

91
00:03:44,533 --> 00:03:46,333
You know Susan's won,
like, four years in a row.

92
00:03:46,467 --> 00:03:47,400
Yeah,

93
00:03:47,533 --> 00:03:49,433
but she has no idea
who she's dealing with.

94
00:03:49,567 --> 00:03:50,633
Huh?

95
00:03:50,767 --> 00:03:52,400
Wow, I like the way you think.

96
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:53,800
I like the way you kiss.

97
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,100
Mm, we're not wearing those.

98
00:03:55,233 --> 00:03:56,433
Okay.

99
00:03:59,867 --> 00:04:02,266
There she is.

100
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:05,400
Why are we stopping
at the house?

101
00:04:05,533 --> 00:04:07,467
I left my gloves here.

102
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,667
I love our house.

103
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,333
It's perfect.

104
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:13,200
I can't wait
to raise our family here.

105
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,834
Oh, it's gonna be perfect

106
00:04:14,967 --> 00:04:16,567
once I finish
all the renovations.

107
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,834
Mm...

108
00:04:19,433 --> 00:04:20,533
Can we go inside?

109
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:22,033
Not today.

110
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,033
I just took out
all the flooring.

111
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,166
Aw...

112
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,233
Oh, just think, Nic.

113
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,133
This time next year

114
00:04:29,266 --> 00:04:30,700
we're gonna be in our house

115
00:04:30,834 --> 00:04:32,567
having Christmas dinner
with all our friends.

116
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,633
You promise?

117
00:04:33,767 --> 00:04:34,500
I promise.

118
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:41,867
Oh, wait.

119
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:43,834
Oh.

120
00:04:43,967 --> 00:04:45,033
Huh?

121
00:04:46,934 --> 00:04:48,066
Aw...

122
00:04:54,967 --> 00:04:56,734
The first of many memories
we're going to make here.

123
00:04:56,867 --> 00:04:58,200
Mm-hmm.

124
00:05:09,367 --> 00:05:12,533
Hey, hey.

125
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:14,100
Seriously, Susan,

126
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:15,734
why bother having people
over to your house

127
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:17,300
if you're going to make
your friends do all the work.

128
00:05:17,433 --> 00:05:19,066
I'm not following.

129
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,767
-Not following?
-Nope.

130
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,433
You realize I made
a glazed ham, roast turkey,

131
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:24,533
rack of lamb,
and Beef Wellington

132
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:25,633
for your party.

133
00:05:25,767 --> 00:05:28,066
Remind me, what exactly
is your contribution?

134
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,233
My fabulous personality.

135
00:05:30,367 --> 00:05:32,100
That's what keeps 'em
coming back for more, sweetie.

136
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,300
-Right, I forgot.
-You're crazy.

137
00:05:35,433 --> 00:05:36,433
Oh...

138
00:05:36,567 --> 00:05:38,700
How is the renovation going?

139
00:05:38,834 --> 00:05:40,600
It's going really good.

140
00:05:40,734 --> 00:05:42,600
I mean, slowly but surely,

141
00:05:42,734 --> 00:05:43,700
but I can't wait
for you to see it.

142
00:05:43,834 --> 00:05:45,767
It's going to be amazing.

143
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,700
Hey...

144
00:05:46,834 --> 00:05:47,800
Hi!

145
00:05:47,934 --> 00:05:49,233
So, what do you think

146
00:05:49,367 --> 00:05:51,100
of your sister's
Christmas sweaters?

147
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:52,767
I want one.

148
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,600
I'll trade you yours
for Phil's.

149
00:05:54,734 --> 00:05:56,467
Uh, ooh, no.

150
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,567
-Not a chance.
-Yeah, no.

151
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,967
Attention, everyone!

152
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,367
For crying out loud,
Susan, lose the bullhorn!

153
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,500
Lose the bullhorn?

154
00:06:03,633 --> 00:06:04,867
Please! Yes!

155
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,100
Okay, all right.

156
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:07,300
Well, friends,

157
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:08,934
it is time to give out
the grand prize

158
00:06:09,066 --> 00:06:11,600
for the best Christmas outfit.

159
00:06:11,734 --> 00:06:14,467
This cashmere throw
from Ooh La La Gift Emporium

160
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,533
goes to....

161
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:17,500
me!

162
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:19,700
It's not fair.

163
00:06:19,834 --> 00:06:20,767
You've won
five years in a row now.

164
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,033
Have some jingle juice.

165
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,567
You'll be hearing jingle bells
in no time.

166
00:06:25,834 --> 00:06:27,266
Ah, cheers.

167
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,467
Cheers.

168
00:06:37,967 --> 00:06:39,300
Ooh, we are out of ice.

169
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:42,033
Tom, we've run out of ice.

170
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,533
What do you want me
to do, Susan?

171
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:46,266
You could break off
some icicles?

172
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,533
Uh, no, look, I could just
go to the market

173
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:49,667
and get some bags.

174
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,700
No need.

175
00:06:50,834 --> 00:06:52,500
Tom, wake the kids.
We need those icicles.

176
00:06:52,633 --> 00:06:54,200
Susan, do not wake up the kids.

177
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,667
Henry can go.
He doesn't mind.

178
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,500
Really, I do not mind.

179
00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:58,133
-You sure?
-Yeah.

180
00:06:58,266 --> 00:06:58,967
All right then.

181
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,934
Okay, thank you.

182
00:07:01,066 --> 00:07:02,000
Hurry back.

183
00:07:02,133 --> 00:07:03,400
-I love you.
-Love you.

184
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:04,767
Thank you.

185
00:07:12,367 --> 00:07:14,834
Next year,
I'm gonna put my foot down.

186
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:17,767
I'm telling Susan
I am not bringing any more food.

187
00:07:19,633 --> 00:07:23,166
I'm going to tell her
to order a few pizzas.

188
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,066
We can all throw in a few bucks,
call it a day.

189
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,367
What do you think, Nic?

190
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,166
Nic?

191
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,867
Where is Henry?
He should have been back by now.

192
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm sure he's fine.

193
00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:34,767
I tried calling him.

194
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,000
It went straight to voicemail.

195
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:38,567
I'm sure he'll be walking
through that door any minute.

196
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,233
Hello?

197
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,300
Hey, Tom.

198
00:08:11,433 --> 00:08:12,800
How you doing, Nic?

199
00:08:12,934 --> 00:08:14,266
I'm good.

200
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,333
Thanks for coming.

201
00:08:15,467 --> 00:08:17,800
I know this time of year
could be hard for you.

202
00:08:17,934 --> 00:08:20,734
I'm good, Tom, really.
I'm okay.

203
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,000
You sure you're ready
to let go of the house?

204
00:08:25,133 --> 00:08:26,233
Yep.

205
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,834
Yup, I'm ready.

206
00:08:27,967 --> 00:08:28,934
I'm ready to sell.

207
00:08:29,066 --> 00:08:30,500
Okay, well, like I said,

208
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:32,333
my company is more than happy
to list it for you.

209
00:08:32,467 --> 00:08:34,500
You think I can get
what Henry and I paid for it?

210
00:08:34,633 --> 00:08:36,834
Not till the work's complete.

211
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:38,767
I just don't want you
to take a hit on the house, Nic.

212
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:41,133
Let's get someone in here
that can do the work,

213
00:08:41,266 --> 00:08:43,266
and then think about selling.

214
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,066
Is that okay?

215
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,066
Mm-hmm,

216
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,567
and what about the store?

217
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,800
Any interested buyers?

218
00:08:47,934 --> 00:08:49,834
I've got a couple showings
lined up.

219
00:08:49,967 --> 00:08:50,834
So let's just...

220
00:08:50,967 --> 00:08:51,867
give it a little time,

221
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,734
and I promise you
we will sell the toy store

222
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,133
and this house.

223
00:08:55,266 --> 00:08:56,400
Great.

224
00:08:56,533 --> 00:08:57,233
Thank you, Tom.

225
00:08:57,367 --> 00:08:58,333
You got it.

226
00:08:58,467 --> 00:08:59,734
I'm curious.

227
00:08:59,867 --> 00:09:00,867
About what?

228
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Well, after
you sell everything,

229
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:04,867
this house, the store,

230
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,900
what's next for you?

231
00:09:07,033 --> 00:09:09,300
Oh, you know me, Tom.

232
00:09:09,433 --> 00:09:10,800
I always figure something out.

233
00:09:10,934 --> 00:09:11,967
Right.

234
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,033
I'm gonna go check it out.

235
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,133
All right.

236
00:09:14,266 --> 00:09:15,200
Go for it.

237
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:30,333
Hey.

238
00:09:30,467 --> 00:09:31,467
Got you a gingerbread latte.

239
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,066
Oh, thank you, Nic.

240
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,166
How's it going today?

241
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,166
Good.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, busy.

242
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,333
Any calls?

243
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:39,066
Yes, Mrs. Barnes called.

244
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,967
Said she was looking for
a plastic rocketship

245
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,200
for her grandson.

246
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,000
Oh, I think we've got one
in the back.

247
00:09:44,133 --> 00:09:45,033
Oh, and Pops called.

248
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,000
Twice.

249
00:09:46,133 --> 00:09:46,900
He needs a new razor.

250
00:09:47,033 --> 00:09:48,700
Gail dropped one off
at his house,

251
00:09:48,834 --> 00:09:50,233
but he said
it's a lady's razor,

252
00:09:50,367 --> 00:09:51,200
and it doesn't work,

253
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,033
and then he said
because Gail messed up,

254
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,367
he now has a mustache, so...

255
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,033
He grew a mustache
in two hours?

256
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,633
That's what he said.

257
00:09:58,767 --> 00:09:59,667
You want me
to stop by the pharmacy

258
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,567
and pick him up a new one?

259
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,166
No, it's all right.

260
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,533
I've got to head over there
to make him lunch later anyways.

261
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:04,400
Okay.

262
00:10:04,533 --> 00:10:06,033
Oh, hey, hey, uh...

263
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,834
how did it go with Tom?

264
00:10:07,967 --> 00:10:09,200
Did he say
he could sell the house?

265
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,166
Yeah.

266
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,467
He, uh, just wants me
to finish the remodel first,

267
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,900
but, um,
I just have no idea

268
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:17,467
how I'm going to find
someone to do it.

269
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,533
You know what?

270
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:20,133
I happen to know a guy.

271
00:10:20,266 --> 00:10:22,000
Yeah, he's an old friend.
He's a carpenter.

272
00:10:22,133 --> 00:10:23,533
I think he could help you out.

273
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:24,533
-Oh...
-Want me to call him?

274
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:25,700
Yes.

275
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:27,667
Teddy, please.
That would be amazing.

276
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,100
Thank you.

277
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,533
Ooh, hello.

278
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,700
Merry, merry!

279
00:10:38,834 --> 00:10:40,033
Hello.

280
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,533
Did you get my message
about tonight?

281
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:43,066
What about tonight?

282
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,967
A bunch of us are going to see
"It's a Wonderful Life"

283
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,467
at the Majestic, 8:00.

284
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,533
Please say you'll come.

285
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:48,834
I can't.

286
00:10:48,967 --> 00:10:51,000
I have things to do.

287
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:53,333
I need to...
organize the back.

288
00:10:53,467 --> 00:10:55,333
Nicole, you need
to get out more.

289
00:10:55,467 --> 00:10:56,567
Have some fun.

290
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,900
I have fun.

291
00:10:58,033 --> 00:10:59,667
Reorganizing the stock room
is not fun.

292
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,100
It is for me.

293
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,734
Gary Jankowski is coming
to movie night tonight.

294
00:11:04,867 --> 00:11:05,867
Who?

295
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,967
Gary Jankowski.

296
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,033
The orthodontist?

297
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:08,900
Remember
I told you about him?

298
00:11:09,033 --> 00:11:11,367
The single doctor?

299
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,533
Right... Barry.

300
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:13,767
Gary!

301
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,700
And he is just the sweetest.

302
00:11:15,834 --> 00:11:17,133
I'm sure he is,

303
00:11:17,266 --> 00:11:19,033
but tonight is no good for me.

304
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,867
You know, I have
a lot of stuff to do.

305
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,033
-Mm.
-A lot.

306
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,533
A lot of... a lot of stuff.

307
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:25,967
Mm-hmm.

308
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,300
Fine, be a party pooper,

309
00:11:27,433 --> 00:11:29,367
but you're definitely
coming Tuesday, right?

310
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,100
Tuesday?

311
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:33,700
It's my ugly sweater party,

312
00:11:33,834 --> 00:11:35,367
and, um...

313
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,467
I just thought it would be great
for you to be with all of us...

314
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,734
and you do not want to miss
what I am wearing this year.

315
00:11:42,867 --> 00:11:44,700
Okay?

316
00:11:44,834 --> 00:11:48,433
Biggest fashion disaster
this town has ever seen.

317
00:11:49,867 --> 00:11:51,934
Please say you'll come.

318
00:11:52,066 --> 00:11:53,867
Will Gary Jankowski be there?

319
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,266
As a matter of fact,

320
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,300
he has a dental convention,

321
00:11:56,433 --> 00:11:57,300
so no.

322
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:00,133
Okay then, I will come.

323
00:12:00,266 --> 00:12:01,500
Yes!

324
00:12:01,633 --> 00:12:02,700
Hint...

325
00:12:02,834 --> 00:12:07,333
my sweater requires an outlet
and an extension cord.

326
00:12:07,467 --> 00:12:08,266
Intrigued?

327
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,133
Always.

328
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:10,967
Goodbye.

329
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,300
Bye!

330
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,767
Really?

331
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,700
Chips? Donuts?

332
00:12:25,834 --> 00:12:26,967
Soda?

333
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,500
A frozen pizza, Pops?

334
00:12:28,633 --> 00:12:31,000
Come on.

335
00:12:31,133 --> 00:12:32,333
You know,
I promised Mom and Dad

336
00:12:32,467 --> 00:12:33,100
when they moved away

337
00:12:33,233 --> 00:12:34,166
that I would take care of you.

338
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,200
So, take care of me
and heat up that pizza.

339
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,633
Not a chance.

340
00:12:38,767 --> 00:12:39,867
I'm making you a salad.

341
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,200
So, how you doing, Pops?

342
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:43,667
You feeling good?

343
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,266
I'd feel a lot better

344
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,800
if the Badgers
could get a rebound--

345
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:49,133
Oh, come on, you--

346
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,867
I miss going to games
with you and Henry.

347
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,300
The three of us went
to a lot of games together

348
00:12:56,433 --> 00:12:57,767
last season.

349
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,133
He'd wear that big foam
Badger hat,

350
00:12:59,266 --> 00:13:01,033
and nobody could see past him.

351
00:13:02,233 --> 00:13:03,934
I miss him.

352
00:13:04,066 --> 00:13:06,967
Yeah, those games
were a lot of fun.

353
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,500
You don't have to be brave
with me, honey.

354
00:13:12,633 --> 00:13:16,333
It's okay to show
what you're feeling.

355
00:13:16,467 --> 00:13:18,800
I miss him, too, Pops.

356
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,233
It will get better.

357
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,500
I promise.

358
00:13:23,633 --> 00:13:25,800
How did you get through it
when Grandma died.

359
00:13:28,533 --> 00:13:30,266
Well...

360
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,266
after your Grandma died,

361
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,533
for a year,

362
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:34,934
every single day,

363
00:13:35,066 --> 00:13:36,266
I wrote her a letter.

364
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:39,166
I would pour my heart out,

365
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,166
I would tell her
how much I missed her,

366
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,500
I would tell her about my day,

367
00:13:42,633 --> 00:13:44,900
what was good about my day,
what was bad,

368
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:47,567
and it helped to heal my heart.

369
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,600
Letters.

370
00:13:49,734 --> 00:13:51,867
That is so beautiful.

371
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,400
Yeah, but these days,
you kids don't write letters.

372
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:55,834
Everybody's just texting.

373
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,266
Did you keep
any of those letters?

374
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,467
Yeah, some...

375
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,934
They're in the closet,
on the top shelf, I think.

376
00:14:03,066 --> 00:14:05,000
Can I take some to read?

377
00:14:05,133 --> 00:14:06,834
Well, of course.

378
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,734
About my lunch,
there is a frozen burrito there.

379
00:14:10,867 --> 00:14:12,834
Uh-uh.

380
00:14:14,266 --> 00:14:16,166
I just can't win.

381
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,400
Nope,

382
00:14:17,533 --> 00:14:19,700
not if I have anything
to do with it.

383
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,834
Hey...

384
00:14:53,967 --> 00:14:56,333
Can I come over?

385
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,900
I made you some tea.

386
00:15:11,033 --> 00:15:11,967
Thanks.

387
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,900
You're welcome.

388
00:15:14,033 --> 00:15:16,700
Mm, thanks for letting me
come over.

389
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:19,567
Sometimes, it's just too hard

390
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,900
to be in my apartment
with all those memories,

391
00:15:22,033 --> 00:15:23,000
alone.

392
00:15:23,133 --> 00:15:25,166
You're my best friend.

393
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,567
You're family.

394
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,567
My home is your home.

395
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,066
You know, I've been thinking,

396
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,367
and I've been thinking
that I'm mad at you.

397
00:15:36,433 --> 00:15:37,467
I am mad at you

398
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,533
because that night,

399
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:40,667
the night that Henry died...

400
00:15:42,433 --> 00:15:43,467
you told me he was going
to walk through the door

401
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,467
any minute.

402
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:48,700
I know I did, but...

403
00:15:48,834 --> 00:15:50,500
you know what happened
was a terrible accident.

404
00:15:50,633 --> 00:15:52,867
It was no one's fault.

405
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,133
I'm so scared, Alan.

406
00:15:58,266 --> 00:16:00,200
I know, sweetie.

407
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:01,600
I know.

408
00:16:04,834 --> 00:16:06,233
What are these?

409
00:16:06,367 --> 00:16:09,967
These are letters
that my Pops wrote to my Grandma

410
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,100
when she died.

411
00:16:11,233 --> 00:16:12,367
Oh.

412
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,467
He said that writing them

413
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,433
helped him to not feel so sad.

414
00:16:15,567 --> 00:16:17,033
Aw...

415
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,133
Can I see?

416
00:16:18,266 --> 00:16:19,233
Yeah, sure.

417
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,533
"My dearest Margaret,

418
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:30,767
Today, I found the pin
we bought in Italy.

419
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,700
The cameo you loved to wear.

420
00:16:33,834 --> 00:16:37,100
I sat on our bed
holding it...

421
00:16:37,233 --> 00:16:38,900
and cried."

422
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:42,133
"Until then,

423
00:16:42,266 --> 00:16:44,400
I've been
holding it all together,

424
00:16:44,533 --> 00:16:48,533
but just how much I miss you
finally came flooding out.

425
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:50,734
Forever and always,

426
00:16:50,867 --> 00:16:52,266
Your John."

427
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,867
It's beautiful.

428
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,967
I know.

429
00:16:59,233 --> 00:17:01,166
Okay, we need cookies.

430
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,200
-I've decided.
-Yes, please.

431
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,567
Okay.

432
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,133
Hey, it's your favorite sis.

433
00:17:20,266 --> 00:17:21,667
Another casserole
is on its way.

434
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,834
Be on the lookout.

435
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,266
That day at the house,

436
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,367
you said it would be
the first of many memories.

437
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,734
I didn't think
it would be the last.

438
00:17:58,734 --> 00:18:01,667
One pretty pony tea set.

439
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,367
I hope your daughter
enjoys it, Angela.

440
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm sure she will.

441
00:18:06,133 --> 00:18:07,433
Hey, Nicole,

442
00:18:07,567 --> 00:18:10,133
I heard a rumor
that you're selling the store.

443
00:18:10,266 --> 00:18:11,367
Please tell me that's not true.

444
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,100
It is.

445
00:18:13,233 --> 00:18:15,166
You know, ever since
I first met Henry in college,

446
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,667
it was always his dream
to have a toy store.

447
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,533
I swear, the proudest moment
of that man's life

448
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:21,133
was when we first
opened the doors

449
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,367
to Village Toys.

450
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,934
I remember that day.

451
00:18:24,066 --> 00:18:26,133
You know, we were
each other's partners

452
00:18:26,266 --> 00:18:27,200
I ran the business side,

453
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:28,367
and he was all about
the fun and the whimsy.

454
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,367
Henry was so amazing

455
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,500
at getting every kid
that walked through that door

456
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:35,433
to go to faraway places
with their imagination.

457
00:18:35,567 --> 00:18:36,700
I miss that.

458
00:18:37,734 --> 00:18:40,767
I think we all miss that.

459
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,934
You know, a year ago,

460
00:18:43,066 --> 00:18:44,867
I never would have thought
I'd sell this place,

461
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,834
but then I realized, you know,

462
00:18:46,967 --> 00:18:48,300
this was Henry's passion.

463
00:18:48,433 --> 00:18:49,333
This was Henry's dream.

464
00:18:49,467 --> 00:18:50,600
Without him,

465
00:18:50,734 --> 00:18:51,633
this store doesn't really
make much sense

466
00:18:51,767 --> 00:18:53,200
for me anymore.

467
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,266
I get it.

468
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,867
Sometimes, life shows you
a fork in the road.

469
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,200
You just never know
where life's going to take you.

470
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,867
Yeah.

471
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,266
Here you go.

472
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,934
Marry Christmas, Nicole.

473
00:19:04,066 --> 00:19:05,800
Merry Christmas.

474
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:10,800
Higher, Billy!

475
00:19:10,934 --> 00:19:14,233
The lights need to be
in the garland!

476
00:19:14,367 --> 00:19:16,400
I got it, Mrs. Ward.

477
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:19,533
Well, hello, Nicole.

478
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:21,000
Hi, Helen.

479
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:24,033
I can't remember the last time
I laid eyes on you.

480
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,500
It's been a while.

481
00:19:25,633 --> 00:19:27,066
You're planning
on fixing up the house

482
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,433
so you put it on the market?

483
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:29,633
That's the plan.

484
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,600
Oh, and Billy?

485
00:19:32,734 --> 00:19:35,100
The Rudolph is looking
a little tarnished.

486
00:19:35,233 --> 00:19:36,734
Yes, Mrs. Ward.

487
00:19:36,867 --> 00:19:38,700
You know I'm on the committee

488
00:19:38,834 --> 00:19:42,200
for our neighborhood
Victorian Christmas display.

489
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,734
Well, it all looks
so wonderful, Helen.

490
00:19:44,867 --> 00:19:47,867
This year,
I'm the reindeer captain.

491
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,100
Good heavens! Walter!

492
00:19:54,233 --> 00:19:55,567
Walter, darling!

493
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,200
-Come to Mama!

494
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:58,767
Oh, no!

495
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,900
Is it always like this
around here?

496
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:02,900
I'm sorry?

497
00:20:03,033 --> 00:20:04,567
Dogs in Christmas sweaters.

498
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,700
I must have saw 12
on my ride over here,

499
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:07,934
Santa and reindeer

500
00:20:08,066 --> 00:20:09,266
on every single lawn
on the block.

501
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,433
Speaking of which,
where's yours?

502
00:20:10,567 --> 00:20:12,834
Um...

503
00:20:12,967 --> 00:20:14,033
Oh, Teddy told me

504
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:16,100
that this neighborhood
went all out for the holidays.

505
00:20:16,233 --> 00:20:19,000
This is more than
I could have ever imagined.

506
00:20:19,133 --> 00:20:20,266
Yes, everyone around here

507
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,867
does seem to have
Christmas fever.

508
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,900
Apparently so.

509
00:20:23,033 --> 00:20:24,333
You must be Joe Roberts.

510
00:20:24,467 --> 00:20:25,600
Teddy's friend, the carpenter?

511
00:20:25,734 --> 00:20:27,000
Nicole, right?

512
00:20:27,133 --> 00:20:28,200
Yes.

513
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:29,400
Thank you for meeting me here.

514
00:20:29,533 --> 00:20:30,433
Yeah, yeah.

515
00:20:30,567 --> 00:20:31,834
Beautiful house.

516
00:20:31,967 --> 00:20:33,533
Teddy said
that you needed some work.

517
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:35,100
You were thinking
about selling it?

518
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:37,600
Yes, uh... you want to take
a look around?

519
00:20:37,734 --> 00:20:38,767
Sure.
Should I follow you in?

520
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,233
Oh, um...

521
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,867
You know what,
why don't you go ahead?

522
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,700
I need to make a phone call,

523
00:20:45,834 --> 00:20:47,567
and after you've had a chance
to look around,

524
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,433
then we can talk...

525
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:49,400
out here...

526
00:20:49,533 --> 00:20:50,266
about how to proceed.

527
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,400
Yeah.

528
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:52,533
Yeah, sure, whatever you want.

529
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:54,533
Okay, thank you.

530
00:21:14,266 --> 00:21:15,166
You okay?

531
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,967
Yes.

532
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:17,967
I'm fine.

533
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,934
Um, what do you think

534
00:21:20,066 --> 00:21:20,934
about the work
that needs to be done?

535
00:21:21,066 --> 00:21:22,166
Well, I can do it.

536
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,467
I just need to purchase
some moldings and wood, and--

537
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,400
Great.

538
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,433
My checkbook's at the store.

539
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:26,967
Meet me there?

540
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,133
So, does this mean I'm hired?

541
00:21:28,266 --> 00:21:29,967
Yes.

542
00:21:33,033 --> 00:21:34,066
Okay, then.

543
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,433
I guess I'm hired.

544
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,000
Hi.

545
00:21:42,133 --> 00:21:44,166
Here's the estimate
from the lumber yard.

546
00:21:45,934 --> 00:21:47,166
Looks good.

547
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,300
I just need to find
my checkbook.

548
00:21:52,133 --> 00:21:52,967
So do you want
to pick out the wood

549
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,100
for the living room mantel?

550
00:21:54,233 --> 00:21:55,400
No.

551
00:21:55,533 --> 00:21:56,567
You can decide.

552
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,467
I really don't need to be
a part of those decisions.

553
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,967
Okay.

554
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:01,734
Uh, I'll give you my work cell.

555
00:22:01,867 --> 00:22:03,867
Anything you think of,
anything you need to run by me,

556
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,133
you can just give me a call.

557
00:22:05,266 --> 00:22:06,633
You know what,
that won't be necessary.

558
00:22:06,767 --> 00:22:08,700
Um, I'm really just
fixing it up to sell.

559
00:22:08,834 --> 00:22:10,200
So if you have any questions,

560
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:11,867
you can reach out
to my realtor, Tom Young.

561
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,200
He's got an office
on First Street.

562
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,133
Tom Young.
Got it.

563
00:22:15,266 --> 00:22:17,400
Where is my checkbook?

564
00:22:17,533 --> 00:22:18,967
Uh...

565
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,000
Oh!

566
00:22:20,133 --> 00:22:22,166
Right here.

567
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,567
Yo-ho-ho!

568
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,367
Well, I can see now
why you and Teddy are friends.

569
00:22:43,967 --> 00:22:47,400
Okay, so I just got back
from taking Pops to the barbers,

570
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,700
and get this,

571
00:22:49,834 --> 00:22:51,233
he wanted sideburns.

572
00:22:51,367 --> 00:22:53,633
What?

573
00:22:53,767 --> 00:22:55,166
I tell you, Nicole,
something's up with him.

574
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,734
He's gone completely nutty.

575
00:22:56,867 --> 00:22:58,967
Well, I think
it's all the sugar he eats,

576
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,066
personally.

577
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,033
Uh...

578
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:02,867
Oh!

579
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,700
Thanks.

580
00:23:03,834 --> 00:23:04,900
Sorry.

581
00:23:05,033 --> 00:23:06,967
Was I... interrupting something?

582
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:07,767
Oh, no, no, no.

583
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,767
Um, sorry.

584
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,033
Joe this is my sister, Gail.

585
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:10,867
Gail, this is Joe.

586
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,367
Ahoy.

587
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,934
Ahoy...

588
00:23:14,066 --> 00:23:16,967
I just hired Joe to do
the remodel on my house.

589
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,967
You're remodeling Tudor Road?

590
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,400
Yeah.

591
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:23,033
Tom said I should
before we put it up for sale.

592
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:25,133
You're ready to sell the house?

593
00:23:25,266 --> 00:23:26,266
Yeah.

594
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,734
Yeah, I think it's time.

595
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:30,734
It's been almost a year
since he died.

596
00:23:33,834 --> 00:23:36,633
So, I heard

597
00:23:36,767 --> 00:23:39,567
you might be going
to Susan's party tonight.

598
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,633
Yes, I said I might.

599
00:23:42,767 --> 00:23:43,467
Um...

600
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,467
I understand.

601
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,200
But you should go.
You should go.

602
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:48,367
Go have fun.

603
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,467
I mean, Susan said

604
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,867
her outfit's going to be
even crazier than ever.

605
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,100
Oh, Teddy and I picked out
some pretty solid sweaters

606
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:55,033
to wear to the party.

607
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:58,200
You're going
to Susan and Tom's party?

608
00:23:58,333 --> 00:23:59,600
Yeah, Teddy invited me.

609
00:23:59,734 --> 00:24:01,700
He said Susan said
everyone was welcome.

610
00:24:01,834 --> 00:24:03,200
That sounds like Susan.

611
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:04,433
Yeah.

612
00:24:04,567 --> 00:24:05,667
Well, I'd better
get back to the house.

613
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,033
Uh, nice to meet you, Gail.

614
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:08,066
Same.

615
00:24:13,133 --> 00:24:15,667
So, if you change your mind,

616
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,333
and feel like coming
to the party tonight...

617
00:24:18,567 --> 00:24:20,000
We can go together

618
00:24:20,133 --> 00:24:22,500
and we don't have to stay
very long.

619
00:24:22,633 --> 00:24:23,700
Okay.

620
00:24:23,834 --> 00:24:25,033
Maybe.

621
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:26,266
-Okay.
-Okay.

622
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,200
I'll check in with you later.

623
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:29,133
Great.

624
00:24:30,734 --> 00:24:32,333
Nice guy.

625
00:24:36,967 --> 00:24:38,533
Did you bring
the fruitcake, Phil?

626
00:24:38,667 --> 00:24:40,867
No one likes fruitcake, Gail.

627
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,767
I told Susan
we were bringing fruitcake.

628
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,834
I think we still have one
from last year

629
00:24:44,967 --> 00:24:46,934
in the trunk of the car.

630
00:24:47,066 --> 00:24:49,100
Think anyone
will know the difference?

631
00:24:49,233 --> 00:24:50,800
With a fruitcake?

632
00:24:59,066 --> 00:25:00,867
Take my hand.

633
00:25:02,967 --> 00:25:04,934
I got you, Nic.

634
00:25:05,066 --> 00:25:06,600
I got you.

635
00:25:16,066 --> 00:25:17,700
Attention, everyone!

636
00:25:17,834 --> 00:25:21,767
It is time to give out the prize
for the best sweater!

637
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,000
Our second place winner
this year is...

638
00:25:25,133 --> 00:25:26,033
Alan!

639
00:25:27,533 --> 00:25:28,367
You are the lucky winner

640
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,700
of this lovely
holiday-scented candle.

641
00:25:31,967 --> 00:25:33,500
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute.

642
00:25:33,633 --> 00:25:34,934
I think I gave you this
for Christmas last year.

643
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:36,433
Ooh...

644
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:39,066
I was hoping my regifting
would go unnoticed this year.

645
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,066
Yeah, well, I noticed.

646
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,600
Well...

647
00:25:41,734 --> 00:25:43,767
and now our grand prize
is this cheese board

648
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,667
that is from
Village Trinkets and Treasures

649
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,266
goes to....

650
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,667
Hmm... me!

651
00:25:51,667 --> 00:25:52,900
I mean, come on.

652
00:25:53,033 --> 00:25:55,233
It's not fun
if you win every year, Susan.

653
00:25:55,367 --> 00:25:57,500
Don't get your tinsel
in a tangle.

654
00:25:57,633 --> 00:25:59,600
Oh, what do you know,
it's already personalized.

655
00:25:59,734 --> 00:26:02,100
Ooh...
how did that get there?

656
00:26:40,233 --> 00:26:41,567
Oh, thank you.

657
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,934
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

658
00:26:43,066 --> 00:26:45,066
Wow, your friends are fun.

659
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,467
They are quite a bunch.

660
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,166
Are the holidays
always like this?

661
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,166
Yeah, every Christmas.

662
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,934
You should see
Alan's gift exchange.

663
00:26:53,066 --> 00:26:53,934
It's pretty cut-throat.

664
00:26:54,066 --> 00:26:55,934
-Cut-throat?
-Oh, yeah.

665
00:26:56,066 --> 00:26:58,934
Attention, everyone,
Alan is demanding a recount,

666
00:26:59,066 --> 00:27:00,467
and to be perfectly clear,

667
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,333
I strongly object,

668
00:27:02,467 --> 00:27:04,867
based on the uniqueness
and creativity of my sweater.

669
00:27:08,166 --> 00:27:10,100
Honey, I think your sweater
just blew a fuse.

670
00:27:20,166 --> 00:27:21,066
Too loud in there?

671
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,700
Yeah, and too hot.

672
00:27:23,834 --> 00:27:26,934
It's like she has the heat up
to 90 degrees.

673
00:27:29,266 --> 00:27:30,300
Man, this neighborhood
is something else.

674
00:27:30,433 --> 00:27:32,433
Yeah, I guess it is.

675
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:33,800
Did you grow up here?

676
00:27:33,934 --> 00:27:35,800
Been here my whole life,

677
00:27:35,934 --> 00:27:37,934
except for the four years
I went to college.

678
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,233
It must be nice,

679
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,900
actually really
being from somewhere.

680
00:27:42,033 --> 00:27:44,700
I was an army brat,
so we moved around all the time.

681
00:27:44,834 --> 00:27:46,900
Every year it was a new town,
a new school,

682
00:27:47,033 --> 00:27:48,367
Christmas in a different house.

683
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,600
When I was a kid,

684
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:51,934
I was just wanted, you know,
some stability in my life,

685
00:27:52,066 --> 00:27:54,300
a house I could call my own.

686
00:27:54,433 --> 00:27:56,433
You never had
a house of your own?

687
00:27:56,567 --> 00:27:59,066
Oh, dozens, actually.

688
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,500
Well, yeah,
when I was little,

689
00:28:00,633 --> 00:28:04,100
I used to carve
all sorts of little houses.

690
00:28:04,233 --> 00:28:07,333
You know, ones with big roofs
and white picket fences,

691
00:28:07,467 --> 00:28:09,100
porches, high ceilings.

692
00:28:09,233 --> 00:28:11,200
I guess I thought

693
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:13,467
that if I built it,

694
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,166
then maybe it would
become a reality,

695
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:20,700
that someday
I would build a home for real.

696
00:28:20,834 --> 00:28:23,200
So, have you built
your dream home yet?

697
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:24,200
Oh, no, not yet.

698
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:25,333
Why not?

699
00:28:27,467 --> 00:28:29,667
I guess I'm just still looking

700
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,266
for the right place
to build the foundation.

701
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,200
Hmm.

702
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:33,333
But until then,

703
00:28:33,467 --> 00:28:34,800
you know, I'm happy
doing that for other people.

704
00:28:34,934 --> 00:28:36,266
Huh.

705
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,033
So I guess I hired
the right guy for the job then.

706
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:39,467
I guess you did.

707
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,700
Mm-hmm.

708
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,500
I'm going to get going.

709
00:28:43,633 --> 00:28:45,200
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

710
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,834
Hey, are you walking home?

711
00:28:49,967 --> 00:28:51,100
Yeah.

712
00:28:51,233 --> 00:28:52,433
Me too.

713
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:53,500
This direction?

714
00:28:53,633 --> 00:28:55,767
Uh, yeah.

715
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,800
Ah.

716
00:28:56,934 --> 00:28:58,633
Crazy idea here,

717
00:28:58,767 --> 00:29:02,367
but I mean, since we're both
walking the same way,

718
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,567
maybe we can
walk home together?

719
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,934
Okay.

720
00:29:06,066 --> 00:29:07,533
Cool.

721
00:29:09,233 --> 00:29:12,000
So, what was
your childhood dream?

722
00:29:12,133 --> 00:29:15,367
I guess to own my own business
and sell my knits.

723
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,266
That's an amazingly practical
grown-up dream.

724
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,233
Well, I guess
there was another one.

725
00:29:21,367 --> 00:29:23,166
I mean, it's not really
a dream.

726
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,066
I was just a little kid,
and it's kind of silly.

727
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,333
Come on, tell me,
I want to know.

728
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:31,166
All right, so, there's
this really big pine tree,

729
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,367
and it sits just in the middle
of this meadow

730
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,333
outside of town,

731
00:29:34,467 --> 00:29:35,433
all by itself,

732
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:36,500
and I always thought

733
00:29:36,633 --> 00:29:38,266
it looked like
the loneliest tree in the world.

734
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,066
So this one Christmas,

735
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,834
I gathered up
all the remaining ornaments

736
00:29:41,967 --> 00:29:43,033
and decorations I could find,

737
00:29:43,166 --> 00:29:44,433
and I rode my bike
out there

738
00:29:44,567 --> 00:29:46,934
with the intention
of decorating it,

739
00:29:47,066 --> 00:29:48,567
but a little pink bike
on an icy road

740
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,734
only gets you so far.

741
00:29:50,867 --> 00:29:52,333
Maybe, but you had a dream.

742
00:29:52,467 --> 00:29:54,667
That's all that matters, right?

743
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,700
Well, this is me, so...

744
00:29:56,834 --> 00:29:57,667
-Night.
-Night.

745
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,934
Hey.

746
00:29:59,066 --> 00:30:01,867
You should go
decorate that tree.

747
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,533
That is a crazy idea.

748
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:05,000
Sometimes, those are
the best kind.

749
00:30:42,734 --> 00:30:43,934
I'm pretty sure

750
00:30:44,066 --> 00:30:46,834
that nothing will ever compare
to the pain of losing you.

751
00:30:46,967 --> 00:30:49,400
I wake up every day
and I ask myself,

752
00:30:49,533 --> 00:30:51,600
how can I possibly
move forward in this life

753
00:30:51,734 --> 00:30:53,433
without you?

754
00:30:53,567 --> 00:30:55,667
Who am I now that you're gone?

755
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,066
Who am I
stepping into the unknown?

756
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,333
You haven't read

757
00:31:32,467 --> 00:31:33,600
'Twas the Night
Before Christmas?

758
00:31:33,734 --> 00:31:35,967
Well, you need to read this,

759
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,233
and before you know it,

760
00:31:38,367 --> 00:31:40,100
visions of sugar plums
will be dancing in your head.

761
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:41,400
Hi.

762
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:43,200
Here. Just, uh,
excuse me for one moment.

763
00:31:45,367 --> 00:31:46,667
Hey, what's going on?

764
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,734
You look like
you've just seen a ghost.

765
00:31:47,867 --> 00:31:49,700
I texted Henry.

766
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:51,600
What?

767
00:31:51,734 --> 00:31:52,767
You texted Henry?

768
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,133
Like Pops did
with the letters,

769
00:31:54,266 --> 00:31:55,433
and someone texted--

770
00:31:55,567 --> 00:31:56,567
Just look.

771
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,166
Read it.

772
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,200
"I'm so sorry.

773
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:01,667
This is not
who you think it is.

774
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,066
I got a new phone,

775
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,800
and this is the number
I was given.

776
00:32:05,934 --> 00:32:09,000
I also have experienced
a great loss in my life."

777
00:32:10,367 --> 00:32:13,166
"I understand
what you're going through."

778
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,233
Someone has Henry's number.

779
00:32:17,967 --> 00:32:19,734
Well, yeah, I see that.

780
00:32:21,133 --> 00:32:22,333
Well, maybe you should
look past that.

781
00:32:22,467 --> 00:32:25,400
Look what this person
is saying to you.

782
00:32:25,533 --> 00:32:26,633
They understand
what you're going through.

783
00:32:26,767 --> 00:32:28,033
They get it.

784
00:32:28,166 --> 00:32:29,133
Well, what should I do?

785
00:32:29,266 --> 00:32:31,633
Well, I don't know, Nic.

786
00:32:31,767 --> 00:32:33,467
Something tells me
Henry had a hand in this.

787
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,734
Henry?

788
00:32:34,867 --> 00:32:36,467
What do you mean?

789
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,967
Well, maybe
it's a sign from Henry.

790
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,300
A sign?

791
00:32:39,433 --> 00:32:40,500
What kind of sign?

792
00:32:40,633 --> 00:32:43,667
Maybe the person
that sent you that text

793
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,400
is like an angel that Henry sent
to watch over you.

794
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:48,467
Just think about it.

795
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,600
What are the odds

796
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:51,333
that someone who has
gone through a loss like you

797
00:32:51,467 --> 00:32:53,900
would end up
with Henry's number?

798
00:33:00,266 --> 00:33:01,700
There you go, Nicole.

799
00:33:01,834 --> 00:33:02,700
One turkey on rye.

800
00:33:02,834 --> 00:33:03,800
Hold the mayo for Pops.

801
00:33:03,934 --> 00:33:04,867
Can I throw in a donut for him?

802
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,467
Absolutely not.

803
00:33:07,767 --> 00:33:09,033
-Morning.
-Morning.

804
00:33:09,166 --> 00:33:10,367
I was just about
to head over to the house.

805
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,433
Morning coffee first?

806
00:33:11,567 --> 00:33:12,567
I need to satisfy
my sweet tooth.

807
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,100
Ooh, you've come
to the right place.

808
00:33:14,233 --> 00:33:15,700
What can I get you?

809
00:33:15,834 --> 00:33:18,967
Uh, let me have
a piece of the fruitcake...

810
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,066
No... No,
I am gonna go with

811
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,700
a slice of
the gingerbread spice cake.

812
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,133
All right, Mike, no,

813
00:33:24,266 --> 00:33:26,700
uh... rum cake?

814
00:33:26,834 --> 00:33:28,233
No good?

815
00:33:28,367 --> 00:33:29,600
Everything's good.

816
00:33:29,734 --> 00:33:31,600
No, no, of course, it is.

817
00:33:31,734 --> 00:33:34,133
It's just
it's his first time here,

818
00:33:34,266 --> 00:33:36,400
so he has to get
the peppermint-bark cupcake.

819
00:33:36,533 --> 00:33:38,233
Cupcake for breakfast?

820
00:33:38,367 --> 00:33:40,100
You haven't lived

821
00:33:40,233 --> 00:33:41,734
until you've had Mike's
peppermint-bark cupcake.

822
00:33:41,867 --> 00:33:43,300
All right, Mike,

823
00:33:43,433 --> 00:33:44,967
we're going with
one of those, please.

824
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,100
All right.

825
00:33:51,066 --> 00:33:53,767
The moment of truth.

826
00:33:56,533 --> 00:33:58,066
Come on, Mike!

827
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,700
What?

828
00:34:01,834 --> 00:34:03,266
This is not fair!

829
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,300
This is amazing!

830
00:34:04,433 --> 00:34:06,533
-This is amazing!

831
00:34:06,667 --> 00:34:08,200
Aw...

832
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:11,700
It's good seeing you
laughing again, Nicole.

833
00:34:11,834 --> 00:34:13,934
Um, I should...
I should get going.

834
00:34:14,066 --> 00:34:14,934
All right.

835
00:34:15,066 --> 00:34:15,934
Okay, goodbye.

836
00:34:16,066 --> 00:34:17,266
Goodbye, Nicole.

837
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,533
-Okay. Bye.
-See you.

838
00:34:18,667 --> 00:34:20,166
Bye!

839
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,467
May I have a large coffee,
please, Mike?

840
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,567
Sure, comin' right up.

841
00:34:35,467 --> 00:34:36,600
No donut?

842
00:34:36,734 --> 00:34:38,233
Not today, Pops.

843
00:34:44,967 --> 00:34:47,033
Hey, Pops, can I
ask you something?

844
00:34:47,166 --> 00:34:49,367
After Grandma died,

845
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,200
did you ever
reach out to anyone

846
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:54,300
to talk about the things
you were feeling?

847
00:34:54,433 --> 00:34:55,767
Well, of course.

848
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,433
Even people you didn't know?

849
00:34:57,567 --> 00:34:59,633
Sometimes, that's easier.

850
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:02,900
I'll let you in
on a little secret, honey.

851
00:35:05,533 --> 00:35:08,000
After your Grandma died,

852
00:35:08,133 --> 00:35:09,700
every day,

853
00:35:09,834 --> 00:35:11,533
I would go
to the community center

854
00:35:11,667 --> 00:35:12,433
for a swim, remember?

855
00:35:12,567 --> 00:35:13,567
Mm-hmm.

856
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,867
Well, the truth is,

857
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,266
for a whole year,

858
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,834
I never stepped foot
in the pool.

859
00:35:17,967 --> 00:35:18,667
What?

860
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,367
Yeah.

861
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,734
There was a young girl
who worked there.

862
00:35:22,867 --> 00:35:27,166
She was maybe 20
when her mother passed away.

863
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,600
I think she recognized
my broken heart.

864
00:35:29,734 --> 00:35:30,900
She...

865
00:35:31,033 --> 00:35:32,900
I could talk to her
about all the grief

866
00:35:33,033 --> 00:35:34,567
that I was carrying around.

867
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,200
She was somebody who understood
exactly what I was feeling.

868
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:39,100
Well, you could have
talked to me.

869
00:35:39,233 --> 00:35:40,066
Oh, honey.

870
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,767
Sometimes, those
that are closest to us,

871
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,233
bless their hearts,

872
00:35:45,367 --> 00:35:46,433
try too hard to help us heal,

873
00:35:46,567 --> 00:35:47,767
you know what I mean?

874
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,266
Yeah, like Gail's casseroles.

875
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,166
So you never went swimming?

876
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,200
Well, a year later,
I went back to the pool.

877
00:35:57,333 --> 00:35:59,066
I was in the deep end,

878
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,767
but I felt so uneasy.

879
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,000
I was gripping
the side of the pool.

880
00:36:03,133 --> 00:36:04,066
I was scared,

881
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,500
and that girl, she was there,

882
00:36:06,633 --> 00:36:07,600
and she said,

883
00:36:07,734 --> 00:36:09,166
"Just let go."

884
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,667
And did you?

885
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,100
Yes.

886
00:36:13,233 --> 00:36:15,600
Sometimes, you have to let go
in order to move forward.

887
00:36:15,734 --> 00:36:18,066
I'm trying, Pops.

888
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,066
I'm really trying.

889
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,367
I know you are.

890
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,233
It's just hard.

891
00:36:23,367 --> 00:36:25,033
You'll get there.

892
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,467
Oh...

893
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,900
My mitten.

894
00:36:37,033 --> 00:36:38,133
You dropped it at the bakery.

895
00:36:38,266 --> 00:36:39,700
Thank you.

896
00:36:39,834 --> 00:36:40,967
You didn't have
to bring this out here.

897
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,900
Snow is in the forecast,

898
00:36:43,033 --> 00:36:44,700
and you look like a girl
who's thrown a snowball

899
00:36:44,834 --> 00:36:45,700
once or twice in her life.

900
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,967
That's a lot of gifts.

901
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,700
Yeah, they're for the kids
at the children's hospital.

902
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,900
That's gonna make
a lot of kids happy.

903
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,400
Teddy said
you're closing up shop.

904
00:36:59,533 --> 00:37:01,900
February.

905
00:37:02,934 --> 00:37:03,767
And then what?

906
00:37:05,166 --> 00:37:06,467
You know...

907
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,233
I don't know.

908
00:37:07,367 --> 00:37:09,633
Since my fiancÃ© died a year ago,

909
00:37:09,767 --> 00:37:10,767
it's strange.

910
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,300
I feel like
I'm on this journey,

911
00:37:12,433 --> 00:37:15,467
but I don't really know
where the journey's taking me.

912
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,066
Hmm...

913
00:37:18,734 --> 00:37:20,967
Well...

914
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,734
I think there's only
one way to find out.

915
00:37:28,233 --> 00:37:29,967
Pick a card...

916
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,367
What?

917
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,867
Go on.

918
00:37:34,533 --> 00:37:35,767
Let Genie Joe The Amazing

919
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,033
see what the future
holds for you.

920
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:40,300
Genie Joe The Amazing?

921
00:37:40,433 --> 00:37:41,066
That's what
all my friends call me.

922
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,600
Please, Madame!

923
00:37:43,934 --> 00:37:47,567
Let the audience see
what the card you've picked is!

924
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,467
The audience?

925
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,467
What?

926
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,233
Oh!

927
00:37:52,367 --> 00:37:53,967
The audience...

928
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,433
Ah!

929
00:37:56,567 --> 00:37:58,533
The future is bright!

930
00:37:58,667 --> 00:38:00,133
You know what?

931
00:38:00,266 --> 00:38:02,667
I think we actually
should hear from the audience.

932
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,433
Uh...

933
00:38:04,567 --> 00:38:05,867
Well...

934
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,100
what do you think
about Nicole's future,

935
00:38:07,233 --> 00:38:08,700
Lord Fluff 'n' Stuff?

936
00:38:08,834 --> 00:38:10,033
Of course, her future's

937
00:38:10,166 --> 00:38:11,133
looking bright, Joe!

938
00:38:11,266 --> 00:38:13,533
Lord Fluff 'n' Stuff?

939
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:15,834
Okay, just stop!

940
00:38:15,967 --> 00:38:18,166
Everybody thinks
your future's looking good.

941
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,667
Okay.

942
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,800
Yeah.

943
00:38:20,934 --> 00:38:22,800
-Okay, well...

944
00:38:22,934 --> 00:38:24,033
Well, I should get back
to the house.

945
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:25,867
I'm putting in
your new floors today.

946
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,667
Oh.

947
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,200
See you around, Nicole.

948
00:38:29,333 --> 00:38:30,667
Yeah.

949
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,367
See ya.

950
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,500
Nicole...

951
00:38:34,633 --> 00:38:35,600
Uh-oh.

952
00:38:38,433 --> 00:38:39,633
Nicole The Amazing.

953
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,333
Oh... wow.

954
00:38:52,066 --> 00:38:54,367
"The future is bright."

955
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,033
I was thinking
about your loss.

956
00:39:12,166 --> 00:39:14,367
Three years ago,
I lost my brother.

957
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,066
He just turned 29.

958
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,500
We were two brothers,
the best of friends,

959
00:39:18,633 --> 00:39:19,667
but I've learned

960
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,166
sometimes
things that break apart

961
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,000
can come together stronger.

962
00:39:23,133 --> 00:39:26,567
Sometimes, those broken places
will let in the light.

963
00:39:35,567 --> 00:39:38,066
Let the light in, huh?

964
00:39:46,166 --> 00:39:47,433
Hi!

965
00:39:47,567 --> 00:39:48,900
Hi. Mike wanted me
to drop these off for you,

966
00:39:49,033 --> 00:39:50,033
Great.

967
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:51,333
You want to come in?

968
00:39:51,467 --> 00:39:52,433
Sure.

969
00:39:52,567 --> 00:39:53,767
Cool, come on in.

970
00:39:58,367 --> 00:40:00,400
Uh, you know what,
since I have you here,

971
00:40:00,533 --> 00:40:01,934
would you mind
helping me move my couch?

972
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,000
Sure.

973
00:40:03,133 --> 00:40:05,200
Thank you.
Sorry.

974
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:07,767
I'm just trying to, like,
trying to go this way.

975
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:08,767
Okay.

976
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,166
-Okay?
-All right.

977
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,433
One, two, three--

978
00:40:11,567 --> 00:40:13,433
-Whoa!
-Oh, no!

979
00:40:13,567 --> 00:40:15,033
The peppermint bark cupcakes!

980
00:40:15,166 --> 00:40:16,433
I think they're still good?

981
00:40:16,567 --> 00:40:18,900
-Oh, I don't...

982
00:40:19,033 --> 00:40:20,100
You know, are you hungry?

983
00:40:20,233 --> 00:40:21,767
I'm always hungry.

984
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:22,734
I am, too.

985
00:40:22,867 --> 00:40:24,867
Um, I have just the thing.

986
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,767
My sister loves to cook.

987
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,233
She brings me another one
of these massive casseroles

988
00:40:29,367 --> 00:40:31,033
every week.

989
00:40:32,734 --> 00:40:34,667
Mm...

990
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,934
You have to try
the broccoli cheddar.

991
00:40:37,066 --> 00:40:38,934
Oh, I'm still working
on the carnitas and peppers.

992
00:40:39,066 --> 00:40:40,333
Mm...

993
00:40:40,467 --> 00:40:42,934
How many have we had so far?

994
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:45,600
I think, like, 10? 15?

995
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:46,533
I don't know.

996
00:40:46,667 --> 00:40:48,333
I still have so many
in the freezer.

997
00:40:48,467 --> 00:40:49,700
Wow, I think you're going
to have enough meals

998
00:40:49,834 --> 00:40:51,433
to last you till New Year's.

999
00:40:51,567 --> 00:40:54,700
I think I'm set for meals
until next Christmas.

1000
00:40:56,033 --> 00:40:57,333
Oh...

1001
00:40:57,467 --> 00:40:58,600
Oh, you gotta try this.

1002
00:40:58,734 --> 00:40:59,667
So good?

1003
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,834
The mac and cheese is amazing.

1004
00:41:01,967 --> 00:41:03,367
Here.

1005
00:41:05,033 --> 00:41:06,166
-Yeah?
-Mm!

1006
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,533
That is so good.

1007
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:10,934
You know, I think my furniture

1008
00:41:11,066 --> 00:41:13,467
is actually
back where I started.

1009
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,800
-Oh.
-Mm.

1010
00:41:14,934 --> 00:41:16,567
Well...

1011
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,300
You know, when things
aren't going my way,

1012
00:41:18,433 --> 00:41:19,600
and I need
a change in direction,

1013
00:41:19,734 --> 00:41:21,000
I'll just go to the movies.

1014
00:41:21,133 --> 00:41:22,000
To the movies?

1015
00:41:22,133 --> 00:41:23,500
Yeah.

1016
00:41:23,633 --> 00:41:25,400
I'll just sit alone in the dark
and have a good cry.

1017
00:41:25,533 --> 00:41:26,834
You cry at the movies?

1018
00:41:26,967 --> 00:41:27,967
Yeah.

1019
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,133
At everything,
even the previews.

1020
00:41:30,767 --> 00:41:32,000
You know the dancing box
of raisinets

1021
00:41:32,133 --> 00:41:33,600
and the singing soda

1022
00:41:33,734 --> 00:41:34,967
that remind you to get snacks
from the concession stand?

1023
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:35,934
Yeah.

1024
00:41:36,066 --> 00:41:37,400
Gets me every time.

1025
00:41:37,533 --> 00:41:38,700
Really?

1026
00:41:41,633 --> 00:41:43,133
Well, maybe I should
give that a try,

1027
00:41:43,266 --> 00:41:45,600
instead of rearranging
my furniture next time.

1028
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,266
I highly recommend it.

1029
00:41:49,967 --> 00:41:51,734
Oh, there's an early delivery
over at the house.

1030
00:41:51,867 --> 00:41:53,233
I should get going.

1031
00:41:53,367 --> 00:41:54,000
Gotta check it out.

1032
00:41:54,133 --> 00:41:55,100
Okay.

1033
00:41:55,233 --> 00:41:55,934
So, thank you for everything.

1034
00:41:56,066 --> 00:41:56,934
I appreciate it.

1035
00:41:57,066 --> 00:41:58,467
Thanks for stopping by.

1036
00:42:03,533 --> 00:42:04,233
Have a good night.

1037
00:42:04,367 --> 00:42:05,333
You too.

1038
00:42:05,467 --> 00:42:06,300
See you, Nicole.

1039
00:42:06,433 --> 00:42:07,600
See ya.

1040
00:42:13,033 --> 00:42:15,300
Thanks for your kind words.

1041
00:42:15,433 --> 00:42:19,400
I want you to know
I'm sorry for your loss.

1042
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,667
"For months,
the grief just overwhelmed me,

1043
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,233
but lately,
something has changed in me."

1044
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:30,166
"What changed?"

1045
00:42:31,433 --> 00:42:34,367
"I realized that
while my grief may never end,

1046
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:37,133
if I can take
one step forward every day,

1047
00:42:37,266 --> 00:42:41,066
my grief will not be a place
where I stay very long."

1048
00:42:42,367 --> 00:42:45,533
"Remember,
fight for your dreams,

1049
00:42:45,667 --> 00:42:46,567
because I promise you,

1050
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,533
it's those dreams

1051
00:42:48,667 --> 00:42:50,734
that will light
your darkest hours."

1052
00:43:47,734 --> 00:43:49,300
Hey, I hope it's okay,

1053
00:43:49,433 --> 00:43:50,600
I thought I could work
a little later tonight.

1054
00:43:50,734 --> 00:43:51,800
Can I have that, please?

1055
00:43:51,934 --> 00:43:52,700
What?

1056
00:43:52,834 --> 00:43:53,700
That.

1057
00:43:53,834 --> 00:43:55,233
What?
Oh. Oh, this?

1058
00:43:55,367 --> 00:43:57,133
Oh, I just thought it was
something I could get rid of.

1059
00:43:57,266 --> 00:43:58,633
I'll just put it back for you--

1060
00:43:58,767 --> 00:44:00,600
No, no, no, no, it's okay,
I can just take it.

1061
00:44:00,734 --> 00:44:01,967
I'm sorry, I should have
left it where it was.

1062
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,200
It's okay, really.

1063
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:05,300
Um... just keep doing
what you're doing.

1064
00:44:05,433 --> 00:44:07,033
I'm sure it's great.

1065
00:44:07,166 --> 00:44:08,867
Do you want to come inside
and have a look around?

1066
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,166
Uh... I'm good.

1067
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,500
I should get going.

1068
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:15,667
I'm sure it's great.

1069
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:16,934
Really, just great.

1070
00:44:17,066 --> 00:44:18,266
Thank you.

1071
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,467
I'm very grateful
for everything you're doing.

1072
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:37,433
Need some help?

1073
00:44:37,567 --> 00:44:38,433
Let me take a look--

1074
00:44:38,567 --> 00:44:39,500
No, it's okay.

1075
00:44:39,633 --> 00:44:41,100
Um, it's getting late.

1076
00:44:41,233 --> 00:44:42,300
I'll just deal with it
in the morning.

1077
00:44:42,433 --> 00:44:43,633
Then let me give you
a ride home.

1078
00:44:43,767 --> 00:44:45,300
It's fine, it's not very far.

1079
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:46,300
I'm just going to walk.

1080
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:48,166
Then let me walk with you.

1081
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,467
You've already
walked me home once.

1082
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,166
Then let me
walk you home twice.

1083
00:44:52,934 --> 00:44:53,800
I just have to
put some tools away

1084
00:44:53,934 --> 00:44:55,867
and lock up.

1085
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,300
Sure.

1086
00:44:57,433 --> 00:44:58,333
I guess that's fine then.

1087
00:45:06,967 --> 00:45:09,500
Check out these reindeers.
They're so shiny.

1088
00:45:09,633 --> 00:45:11,667
I wonder what kind of polish
they use.

1089
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,433
Well, did you see
the carolers next door?

1090
00:45:13,567 --> 00:45:14,567
Whoa.

1091
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:15,700
Everywhere you look,

1092
00:45:15,834 --> 00:45:18,367
it's like the spirit
of Christmas is all around.

1093
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,600
I can't decide
which house I like best.

1094
00:45:20,734 --> 00:45:21,900
Hmm...

1095
00:45:22,033 --> 00:45:23,400
You know,
when I was a little girl,

1096
00:45:23,533 --> 00:45:24,734
every year,

1097
00:45:24,867 --> 00:45:27,066
my dad used to take me and Gail
for a walk around the town.

1098
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,767
We would walk for hours.

1099
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,066
He wanted us to see

1100
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,734
how each house in the town
was decorated,

1101
00:45:32,867 --> 00:45:35,567
and Gail and I would pretend
we were judges in the Olympics,

1102
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,166
and we'd give
each house a score.

1103
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,233
Okay...

1104
00:45:38,367 --> 00:45:40,367
Okay, so what kind of score

1105
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:41,600
would you give that house?

1106
00:45:41,734 --> 00:45:43,433
Oh, well, this is
the Watson house.

1107
00:45:43,567 --> 00:45:44,834
Every year a 6.5.

1108
00:45:44,967 --> 00:45:46,233
Only a 6.5?

1109
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:49,734
Yeah, I mean, crooked antlers
on the reindeer.

1110
00:45:49,867 --> 00:45:51,934
Oh, and then
rusted Santa sleigh,

1111
00:45:52,066 --> 00:45:53,000
you gotta take off two points,

1112
00:45:53,133 --> 00:45:55,767
and then Rudolph
with a tennis ball for a nose?

1113
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:58,900
I mean, that's gotta be
like a 1.5 deduction.

1114
00:45:59,033 --> 00:46:01,300
-At least?
-Wow...

1115
00:46:01,433 --> 00:46:04,066
Okay.

1116
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,433
Hmm, what about this house?

1117
00:46:06,567 --> 00:46:08,400
This is the Fraleys' house,

1118
00:46:08,533 --> 00:46:10,400
and I give it a 9.0.

1119
00:46:10,533 --> 00:46:12,000
Really?

1120
00:46:12,133 --> 00:46:13,567
A 9.0 for that?

1121
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:17,066
Well, actually,
it's only really that high

1122
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,300
because one year,

1123
00:46:18,433 --> 00:46:20,300
Mr. Fraley heard Gail and I
give it a 5,

1124
00:46:20,433 --> 00:46:22,800
and he actually complained
to our parents,

1125
00:46:22,934 --> 00:46:24,300
and I do not
want a repeat of that.

1126
00:46:24,433 --> 00:46:26,367
No.
No, you do not.

1127
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,333
Okay...

1128
00:46:29,467 --> 00:46:30,300
What about this house?

1129
00:46:30,433 --> 00:46:31,133
Come on.

1130
00:46:31,266 --> 00:46:32,900
No Blitzen.

1131
00:46:33,033 --> 00:46:34,066
Blitzen?

1132
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,600
Blitzen, my favorite reindeer.

1133
00:46:36,734 --> 00:46:38,900
No Blitzen, no perfect score.

1134
00:46:39,033 --> 00:46:39,900
Tough critic.

1135
00:46:40,033 --> 00:46:41,133
Mm, me?

1136
00:46:41,266 --> 00:46:43,433
You should see
Gail's scores.

1137
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:44,467
Are you hungry?

1138
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,533
Don't tell me you've never
had breakfast for dinner.

1139
00:46:55,667 --> 00:46:56,467
I can't say I have.

1140
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,767
So do you make a habit out of
eating breakfast for dinner?

1141
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,100
Oh, yeah.
And dinner for breakfast.

1142
00:47:02,233 --> 00:47:03,200
Ooh. Okay.

1143
00:47:03,333 --> 00:47:05,700
So, breakfast for dinner,
dinner for breakfast?

1144
00:47:05,834 --> 00:47:06,633
Mm-hmm.

1145
00:47:06,767 --> 00:47:08,600
Every Christmas morning,

1146
00:47:08,734 --> 00:47:10,633
my brother and I used
to wake up at 4:00 a.m.

1147
00:47:10,767 --> 00:47:11,800
and make spaghetti and meatballs
for breakfast.

1148
00:47:11,934 --> 00:47:13,967
It used to drive my mom nuts.

1149
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,900
Wow.

1150
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:17,600
So what about Fourth of July?

1151
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:19,400
We'd celebrate on the fifth.

1152
00:47:19,533 --> 00:47:21,633
Mm. And Thanksgiving?

1153
00:47:21,767 --> 00:47:23,533
I mean, dare I ask--
was there turkey involved?

1154
00:47:23,667 --> 00:47:25,767
Why on Earth would
we do something like that?

1155
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:27,400
Right.

1156
00:47:27,533 --> 00:47:28,967
Has anyone ever told you

1157
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,567
you are a very unusual man,
Joe Roberts?

1158
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:32,867
Only every other day
of the week.

1159
00:47:35,367 --> 00:47:37,900
Hey, I can make you my famous
spaghetti and meatballs

1160
00:47:38,033 --> 00:47:38,800
for breakfast one morning.

1161
00:47:38,934 --> 00:47:40,033
At 4:00 a.m.?

1162
00:47:40,166 --> 00:47:41,300
-I don't think so.
-Okay.

1163
00:47:41,433 --> 00:47:42,467
But thank you.

1164
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,834
Then I can
cook you dinner sometime.

1165
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,300
Need anything else, folks?

1166
00:47:50,433 --> 00:47:51,800
Uh, no. Thanks.
I think we're good.

1167
00:47:51,934 --> 00:47:52,734
Yeah.

1168
00:47:52,867 --> 00:47:53,633
Hey!

1169
00:47:53,767 --> 00:47:55,133
You work at
the toy store, right?

1170
00:47:55,266 --> 00:47:56,900
I do.

1171
00:47:57,033 --> 00:47:58,100
You know,
a couple of years ago,

1172
00:47:58,233 --> 00:47:59,233
I bought my daughter

1173
00:47:59,367 --> 00:48:01,000
this stuffed pelican
at your store.

1174
00:48:01,133 --> 00:48:02,700
You knitted
the cutest sweater for it--

1175
00:48:02,834 --> 00:48:04,500
it had candy canes all over it.

1176
00:48:04,633 --> 00:48:06,500
Any chance you can
make one for me?

1177
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:09,767
Oh... um,
it's really just a hobby.

1178
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,033
Oh, well,

1179
00:48:11,166 --> 00:48:12,834
if you change your mind,
let me know.

1180
00:48:12,967 --> 00:48:14,667
I showed that little sweater
to the girls at my book club,

1181
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,500
and they all went nuts
for it.

1182
00:48:16,633 --> 00:48:18,300
I think you'd get
a lot of orders.

1183
00:48:18,433 --> 00:48:19,533
Thank you.

1184
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,200
So...

1185
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:24,333
"So"?

1186
00:48:24,467 --> 00:48:25,800
Your dream

1187
00:48:25,934 --> 00:48:28,500
of selling your designs,
having your own business--

1188
00:48:28,633 --> 00:48:29,967
you said someday
that could happen.

1189
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,033
Yeah, maybe. Someday.

1190
00:48:32,166 --> 00:48:33,467
My father used to say,

1191
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,333
"Someday
isn't a day of the week."

1192
00:48:39,266 --> 00:48:41,133
Go ahead. Try 'em.

1193
00:48:42,333 --> 00:48:44,867
Okay.

1194
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,934
Here it goes.

1195
00:48:47,066 --> 00:48:48,433
What do you think?

1196
00:48:48,567 --> 00:48:50,934
Mm! Those are very good.

1197
00:48:51,066 --> 00:48:52,867
Nice. What kind of score
are you giving those pancakes?

1198
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,700
Mm...

1199
00:48:54,834 --> 00:48:56,500
a 9.5.

1200
00:48:56,633 --> 00:48:58,500
"Nine-point" whatever!
Those are a 10!

1201
00:48:58,633 --> 00:49:00,533
Nope. Not enough butter.

1202
00:49:00,667 --> 00:49:02,533
-Come on.
-You gotta have the butter.

1203
00:49:10,066 --> 00:49:11,767
Ten! Nine!

1204
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:13,767
Eight! Seven! Six!

1205
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:16,667
Five! Four! Three!

1206
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,700
Two! One!

1207
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,533
I'm finding it
very hard this time of year,

1208
00:49:44,667 --> 00:49:45,867
to feel
all of the holiday joy

1209
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,133
everyone around me
is feeling.

1210
00:49:52,967 --> 00:49:55,233
"Don't pack
your holiday memories away.

1211
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:57,400
Cherish them.
Embrace them.

1212
00:49:57,533 --> 00:49:59,200
Let them into your heart."

1213
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,333
He's not here.

1214
00:50:15,467 --> 00:50:17,867
He's gone to "Feel the Vibe".

1215
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:18,900
What?

1216
00:50:19,033 --> 00:50:20,367
He's at "Feel the Vibe"?

1217
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:21,533
I don't know what,

1218
00:50:21,667 --> 00:50:23,533
but something's up
with that man.

1219
00:50:23,667 --> 00:50:25,600
Well, thank you, Rose. See ya.

1220
00:50:25,734 --> 00:50:27,433
Bye.

1221
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,433
To another holiday
ugly gift exchange

1222
00:51:07,567 --> 00:51:08,934
with great friends.

1223
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,734
Cheers!

1224
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:12,567
-Cheers!

1225
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:14,734
All right, let's get into this.

1226
00:51:14,867 --> 00:51:15,967
What do we have here?

1227
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:17,333
Uh...

1228
00:51:17,467 --> 00:51:18,934
what is this?

1229
00:51:19,066 --> 00:51:21,433
A wine-glass holder
for the shower.

1230
00:51:21,567 --> 00:51:23,066
Hey, Susan, this has your name
written all over it.

1231
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,300
I love it.
I need one just like that.

1232
00:51:24,433 --> 00:51:25,333
Thank you.

1233
00:51:25,467 --> 00:51:26,667
Uh, Phil, your turn.

1234
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,800
I'm gonna go ahead and steal
Alan's "sleepy kitty" chia pet.

1235
00:51:29,934 --> 00:51:30,900
Really?

1236
00:51:31,033 --> 00:51:32,433
-Hand it over!
-Really? Grr!

1237
00:51:32,567 --> 00:51:33,433
Oh!

1238
00:51:33,567 --> 00:51:36,333
Fine. Then I am gonna
steal it from Tom.

1239
00:51:36,467 --> 00:51:38,567
But I really like
these fuzzy reindeer slippers.

1240
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:40,333
They're not even
your size, so.

1241
00:51:40,467 --> 00:51:42,567
Fine.

1242
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:43,900
All right. I...

1243
00:51:44,033 --> 00:51:45,400
I'm gonna trade with Gail

1244
00:51:45,533 --> 00:51:48,500
for her Christmas
dashboard figurine set.

1245
00:51:48,633 --> 00:51:49,467
And what do I get?

1246
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,767
Big, pink...

1247
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,500
-sequined...

1248
00:51:53,633 --> 00:51:54,767
-...pillows.

1249
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:57,934
It's a matching set.

1250
00:51:58,066 --> 00:51:59,233
Uh, Joe, did you pick?

1251
00:51:59,367 --> 00:52:02,400
Oh, yes, and I am very happy
with my "scared Santa" ornament,

1252
00:52:02,533 --> 00:52:04,066
so, hands off, everyone.

1253
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,333
Well, one gift left--

1254
00:52:05,467 --> 00:52:07,233
Nicole, your turn.

1255
00:52:07,367 --> 00:52:09,400
Okay. Which one is it?

1256
00:52:09,533 --> 00:52:10,734
I'll try this one.

1257
00:52:11,834 --> 00:52:12,767
Here we go.

1258
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,900
Oh, that is so beautiful.

1259
00:52:20,033 --> 00:52:21,633
Oh, I love that.

1260
00:52:21,767 --> 00:52:23,066
Where can I get one?

1261
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,000
Well, you can't.

1262
00:52:24,133 --> 00:52:25,367
Why?

1263
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,800
It's just a little something
I made last night.

1264
00:52:27,934 --> 00:52:28,700
It's nothing special.

1265
00:52:28,834 --> 00:52:30,133
"Nothing special"?

1266
00:52:30,266 --> 00:52:31,166
I change my mind.

1267
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:32,900
I want to steal the sign
for my wine-holder.

1268
00:52:33,033 --> 00:52:33,800
-What?
-Yeah!

1269
00:52:33,934 --> 00:52:36,166
-It'll look great in my store.
-No!

1270
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:37,033
It's not even
your turn, Susan.

1271
00:52:37,166 --> 00:52:38,700
Fine.

1272
00:52:38,834 --> 00:52:39,633
Thank you.

1273
00:52:39,767 --> 00:52:41,300
I love
my shower wine-holder.

1274
00:52:47,633 --> 00:52:49,600
-Hey.
-Oh, hey.

1275
00:52:52,333 --> 00:52:55,066
You know, I really like
the sign that you made.

1276
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,533
I really like
that sweater you're wearing.

1277
00:52:57,667 --> 00:52:58,734
-Oh.
-Did you make that?

1278
00:52:58,867 --> 00:53:01,200
I did.
It's nothing special.

1279
00:53:01,333 --> 00:53:02,567
It is special, Nicole.

1280
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:03,767
It's very special.

1281
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:05,033
Thank you.

1282
00:53:05,166 --> 00:53:06,100
Tell you what--

1283
00:53:06,233 --> 00:53:07,600
instead of paying me
to renovate your house,

1284
00:53:07,734 --> 00:53:08,800
how about you
just make me two of those

1285
00:53:08,934 --> 00:53:11,934
famous Nicole Graham sweaters,
and we'll call it a day?

1286
00:53:13,433 --> 00:53:15,600
You know,
I'm glad I met you, Joe.

1287
00:53:16,867 --> 00:53:18,400
Does this mean
we're becoming friends?

1288
00:53:18,533 --> 00:53:20,633
I think we are.

1289
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,633
So what do you think
the chances are

1290
00:53:24,767 --> 00:53:26,233
that Phil turns over
that chia pet to me?

1291
00:53:26,367 --> 00:53:27,700
Ooh, not
a snowball's chance in--

1292
00:53:27,834 --> 00:53:29,033
Attention, everyone!

1293
00:53:29,166 --> 00:53:32,467
Alan has sat on my wine-holder
and broke it.

1294
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:36,233
I am demanding that he hand over
the reindeer slippers. Okay?

1295
00:53:36,367 --> 00:53:38,767
Are we all in agreement?

1296
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:41,100
Welcome
to our friend group, Joe.

1297
00:53:41,233 --> 00:53:42,533
-All in favor, say "aye".

1298
00:54:02,834 --> 00:54:04,767
Hey, you need a ride?

1299
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:06,500
Um... no, no, no.

1300
00:54:06,633 --> 00:54:08,133
I don't mind walking.
Thanks.

1301
00:54:08,266 --> 00:54:10,000
Oh, come on.
It just started to snow.

1302
00:54:10,133 --> 00:54:11,567
Get in.

1303
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,934
Okay.

1304
00:54:37,433 --> 00:54:38,333
Do you know this one?

1305
00:54:38,467 --> 00:54:40,266
Because I do not,
and I am going to sing it.

1306
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:09,567
"I was
thinking about you today.

1307
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:11,166
How are you doing?"

1308
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:13,100
Pretty good.

1309
00:55:13,233 --> 00:55:15,667
Lately, I think I've found
some joy in my life.

1310
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,500
For the first time
in a long time,

1311
00:55:17,633 --> 00:55:19,100
I actually forgot
about feeling sad.

1312
00:55:21,367 --> 00:55:22,433
-"Just remember--

1313
00:55:22,567 --> 00:55:24,700
a joyful heart will always
chase away any sorrow."

1314
00:55:58,467 --> 00:56:00,333
What flavor is my mask again?

1315
00:56:00,467 --> 00:56:02,967
Eggnog. I'm gonna be selling it
in my store for the holidays.

1316
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:04,133
Mm. It's so good.

1317
00:56:04,266 --> 00:56:05,500
Oh, don't eat it!

1318
00:56:05,633 --> 00:56:07,467
Why? It tastes so good.
I can't help it.

1319
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:08,900
Let it soak in.

1320
00:56:09,033 --> 00:56:11,200
It's gonna do wonders
for your pores.

1321
00:56:11,333 --> 00:56:12,900
Mm. I'm so glad
we're doing this.

1322
00:56:13,033 --> 00:56:14,166
Me too.

1323
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:17,300
This last year
has been so hard.

1324
00:56:17,433 --> 00:56:19,700
Mm. Really missed you, Nicole.

1325
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:21,633
It's not been the same
without you.

1326
00:56:21,767 --> 00:56:23,066
I think Joe Roberts has been

1327
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,567
a really good thing
for your life.

1328
00:56:25,767 --> 00:56:26,734
What does that mean?

1329
00:56:26,867 --> 00:56:28,367
Oh. Um...

1330
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,233
Just that he's, you know...

1331
00:56:30,367 --> 00:56:32,700
a good guy
to have around.

1332
00:56:32,834 --> 00:56:34,734
What? Wait. No, no, no.

1333
00:56:34,867 --> 00:56:36,867
W-What is this look?
This--

1334
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:37,967
This?

1335
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:39,100
Nothing.

1336
00:56:39,233 --> 00:56:42,233
Okay, good, because
Joe and I are just friends.

1337
00:56:42,367 --> 00:56:43,400
That's all.

1338
00:56:43,533 --> 00:56:44,567
I bet.

1339
00:56:45,767 --> 00:56:46,800
We are!

1340
00:56:46,934 --> 00:56:48,300
You can even ask him!

1341
00:56:48,433 --> 00:56:50,166
-Uh-huh.
-And you know what?

1342
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:52,367
I am in no way ready
to start dating yet, okay?

1343
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:55,066
Especially not with
that podiatrist, or whoever,

1344
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:55,967
that you're trying
to fix me up with.

1345
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:57,533
-Orthodontist--
-Okay.

1346
00:56:57,667 --> 00:57:01,033
And Gary Jankowski is-- whoo!
...everything.

1347
00:57:01,166 --> 00:57:03,200
Uh, ahem.
So is Joe Roberts.

1348
00:57:03,333 --> 00:57:04,133
That's right.

1349
00:57:04,266 --> 00:57:06,900
Stop it, Gail.
You're being annoying.

1350
00:57:07,033 --> 00:57:08,467
-Oh!

1351
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,467
What?

1352
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,467
I... can dish it out,
too, Nicole.

1353
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,533
Oh!

1354
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:19,467
Ladies! Ladies, come on!

1355
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:22,100
Let's keep it
together here, okay?

1356
00:57:22,233 --> 00:57:23,133
You know what, Susan?

1357
00:57:23,266 --> 00:57:24,433
-You're annoying, too!
-Oh!

1358
00:57:24,567 --> 00:57:26,300
How-- oh!

1359
00:57:30,533 --> 00:57:32,367
You're a horrible,
horrible sister.

1360
00:57:35,667 --> 00:57:37,133
The Queen Bees!

1361
00:57:37,266 --> 00:57:38,633
-Yes!
-We're back.

1362
00:57:49,433 --> 00:57:51,900
Gail! This looks amazing.

1363
00:57:52,033 --> 00:57:53,600
-Thank you.
-Mm!

1364
00:57:53,734 --> 00:57:56,600
I will take a...
candy-cane cookie.

1365
00:57:56,734 --> 00:57:58,700
Thank you.

1366
00:57:58,834 --> 00:58:01,300
Mm. Mm, so good.

1367
00:58:01,433 --> 00:58:03,467
I think these cookies
are better than Mike's.

1368
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,133
Hey, I heard that.

1369
00:58:05,266 --> 00:58:06,700
But your cupcakes
are the best.

1370
00:58:06,834 --> 00:58:08,333
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1371
00:58:08,467 --> 00:58:09,533
Oh, I meant to tell you,

1372
00:58:09,667 --> 00:58:11,200
I think I'm gonna be done
with the work on your house

1373
00:58:11,333 --> 00:58:12,266
by Christmas.

1374
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,667
Oh. Sounds good.

1375
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:15,834
I hope you like what I did.

1376
00:58:15,967 --> 00:58:17,700
If you ever want to come
take a look...

1377
00:58:18,834 --> 00:58:20,533
Yeah. Anyway.

1378
00:58:20,667 --> 00:58:22,033
There's this job
over in Rock Springs

1379
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:23,767
that I might start
on the fifth, so.

1380
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,300
What about your shelves?

1381
00:58:25,433 --> 00:58:26,500
What about my shelves?

1382
00:58:26,633 --> 00:58:27,834
The shelves in her apartment.

1383
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:29,867
They're...
basically falling apart.

1384
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:30,934
Falling apart.

1385
00:58:31,066 --> 00:58:32,500
-Yeah.
-Uh--

1386
00:58:32,633 --> 00:58:34,200
Sure. I can take a look,
push the Rock Springs job

1387
00:58:34,333 --> 00:58:35,033
a week or two.

1388
00:58:35,166 --> 00:58:37,867
We'd love that.

1389
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,767
Mm-hmm.

1390
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:47,500
Yeah, he is definitely
good to have around.

1391
00:58:47,633 --> 00:58:48,667
You know?

1392
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,300
Fix a couple of things.

1393
00:58:58,266 --> 00:59:00,367
Beautiful. Thank you.

1394
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:26,600
I don't have
too many left, Nicole,

1395
00:59:26,734 --> 00:59:28,166
but I got some good ones
back here--

1396
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:29,433
perfect for you.

1397
00:59:29,567 --> 00:59:31,400
Uh, let's see--
we have Fraser fir, pine,

1398
00:59:31,533 --> 00:59:34,500
spruce, Balsam fir...

1399
00:59:34,633 --> 00:59:37,400
oh, and, uh, that one there,
that's a beauty.

1400
00:59:37,533 --> 00:59:40,100
Uh, that's a Douglas fir.

1401
00:59:40,233 --> 00:59:42,767
Smell that.
It smells like Christmas.

1402
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,066
Oh!

1403
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,834
And this one here
is the Noble fir.

1404
00:59:47,967 --> 00:59:49,834
It's the perfect holiday tree.

1405
00:59:49,967 --> 00:59:52,066
The needles are actually
soft to the touch.

1406
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,533
Go ahead. Touch it.

1407
00:59:53,667 --> 00:59:56,200
It feels like Christmas.

1408
00:59:58,333 --> 01:00:00,400
I want this one.

1409
01:00:05,967 --> 01:00:07,567
Okay.

1410
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,567
It's a beauty.

1411
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:39,867
I wanted to thank you
for helping me with my grief.

1412
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,900
I know you understand
what I'm going through.

1413
01:00:46,967 --> 01:00:48,233
"Grief comes and goes.

1414
01:00:48,367 --> 01:00:49,900
It shows up
at unexpected times."

1415
01:00:51,734 --> 01:00:54,100
Talking to you made me feel
I'm not alone.

1416
01:00:54,233 --> 01:00:55,767
It brings me feelings
of comfort and peace

1417
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:57,166
when I need it most.

1418
01:00:59,967 --> 01:01:01,834
"I was thinking,
maybe we should meet."

1419
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:05,100
Meet?

1420
01:01:13,934 --> 01:01:15,000
Hey, Helen.

1421
01:01:15,133 --> 01:01:16,734
Nicole! Hi.

1422
01:01:16,867 --> 01:01:20,066
Hi. I was just picking up
some lunch for Pops.

1423
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:22,333
I think he's over
the turkey sandwiches now.

1424
01:01:22,467 --> 01:01:24,633
He's been so picky lately.

1425
01:01:24,767 --> 01:01:25,667
Yes, I now how that is.

1426
01:01:26,667 --> 01:01:28,233
Think he'll go for
tuna on wheat?

1427
01:01:28,367 --> 01:01:29,467
Pops?

1428
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,166
Yeah.

1429
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:33,600
I'm heading over there now,
to bring him some lunch.

1430
01:01:34,767 --> 01:01:36,033
Oh! Um...

1431
01:01:36,166 --> 01:01:38,367
Oh, I was just about
to pick him up lunch,

1432
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:39,900
like I usually do,
but if you're going--

1433
01:01:40,033 --> 01:01:41,333
I got this, Nicole.

1434
01:01:42,767 --> 01:01:44,367
I promise,
I'll take good care of him.

1435
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:47,066
I know you will, Helen.

1436
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,000
Oh! Um, no pickles.

1437
01:01:51,133 --> 01:01:52,200
-Pickles?
-Yeah.

1438
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:53,300
Ah. Okay.

1439
01:01:53,433 --> 01:01:55,000
Oh! And nothing on sourdough.

1440
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,967
What about avocado?

1441
01:01:58,100 --> 01:01:59,734
Avocado on a sandwich?

1442
01:01:59,867 --> 01:02:01,700
Who thinks of
these crazy ideas?

1443
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,900
Good luck.

1444
01:02:19,266 --> 01:02:20,300
Pops?

1445
01:02:20,433 --> 01:02:21,800
-Yeah?
-Hi!

1446
01:02:21,934 --> 01:02:22,900
Oh, hi.

1447
01:02:23,033 --> 01:02:24,033
I just wanted to drop this off.

1448
01:02:24,166 --> 01:02:25,066
Oh, honey. Honey.

1449
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,367
Come in, come in.

1450
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:27,800
Are you wearing cologne?

1451
01:02:27,934 --> 01:02:29,100
Yes, I am.

1452
01:02:29,233 --> 01:02:30,600
I see.

1453
01:02:30,734 --> 01:02:32,600
Sit down. Sit down.

1454
01:02:35,767 --> 01:02:36,834
-Pops...
-Yep?

1455
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:40,800
How do you move on
from the love of your life?

1456
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,633
Oh... uh.

1457
01:02:45,767 --> 01:02:46,767
Well...

1458
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:49,433
Margaret was my first love,

1459
01:02:49,567 --> 01:02:50,900
and...

1460
01:02:51,033 --> 01:02:52,900
the love doesn't go anyplace.

1461
01:02:53,033 --> 01:02:57,300
It just finds a new place,
deep in your heart.

1462
01:02:57,433 --> 01:03:00,433
I haven't given up
on love, Nicole.

1463
01:03:00,567 --> 01:03:02,133
I might've been a little late,

1464
01:03:02,266 --> 01:03:03,600
but I came to realize,

1465
01:03:03,734 --> 01:03:06,033
if you're given
a second chance at love,

1466
01:03:06,166 --> 01:03:08,133
you'd better grab it
with both hands.

1467
01:03:08,266 --> 01:03:10,433
I really like her, Pops.

1468
01:03:10,567 --> 01:03:11,533
Me too.

1469
01:03:11,667 --> 01:03:12,700
Okay!

1470
01:03:12,834 --> 01:03:15,266
What? No! You have to wait
till Christmas morning.

1471
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,367
At my age?

1472
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:17,533
Why wait?

1473
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:23,533
Oh, honey.

1474
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:28,033
I love this.

1475
01:03:28,166 --> 01:03:30,000
I'm so glad you like it.

1476
01:03:30,133 --> 01:03:32,834
Oh, I love it
when you make me things.

1477
01:03:32,967 --> 01:03:34,600
I still have the gloves
you made for me

1478
01:03:34,734 --> 01:03:35,834
when you were a little girl.

1479
01:03:35,967 --> 01:03:38,000
Oh, Pops.
Those had seven fingers.

1480
01:03:38,133 --> 01:03:39,367
You can throw those away now.

1481
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:41,467
Oh, no.
They're easier to put on.

1482
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:43,633
-Okay, here.

1483
01:03:46,333 --> 01:03:47,600
Here.

1484
01:03:47,734 --> 01:03:48,767
What's this?

1485
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:50,867
-My gift to you.
-Oh...

1486
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,800
Well, I want to wait until
Christmas morning to open mine.

1487
01:03:52,934 --> 01:03:54,300
Why?

1488
01:03:54,433 --> 01:03:57,133
Okay, fine.
Maybe just a quick peek.

1489
01:04:02,233 --> 01:04:03,567
Grandma's pin?

1490
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:04,567
Yeah.

1491
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:07,100
Oh, Pops, I can't take this.

1492
01:04:08,066 --> 01:04:09,100
I want you to have it.

1493
01:04:10,834 --> 01:04:12,934
I will cherish it forever.

1494
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,900
That's why
I'm giving it to you.

1495
01:04:18,367 --> 01:04:19,567
Thank you.

1496
01:04:20,834 --> 01:04:22,166
Merry Christmas, honey.

1497
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:24,400
Merry Christmas.

1498
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:31,100
-Hi!
-Hi.

1499
01:04:31,233 --> 01:04:33,900
So I made you your favorite--
mac and cheese.

1500
01:04:34,033 --> 01:04:37,000
Just fire up the oven to 350,
put on another pair of sweats,

1501
01:04:37,133 --> 01:04:38,734
and you'll be good to go.

1502
01:04:38,867 --> 01:04:40,000
Thank you.

1503
01:04:40,133 --> 01:04:41,367
Whoa!

1504
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:44,233
Goodbye, sweats.

1505
01:04:44,367 --> 01:04:46,533
Yeah, I got this
from Susan's shop.

1506
01:04:46,667 --> 01:04:48,500
I'm meeting someone tonight.

1507
01:04:48,633 --> 01:04:50,266
Let me guess.

1508
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:51,667
Are you meeting Joe?

1509
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:53,500
No. Not Joe.

1510
01:04:53,633 --> 01:04:55,233
It's actually
someone you don't know.

1511
01:04:55,367 --> 01:04:57,333
Well, I don't really
know them, either.

1512
01:04:57,467 --> 01:04:58,533
It's just someone

1513
01:04:58,667 --> 01:05:00,133
who's been helping me through
some things, you know?

1514
01:05:00,266 --> 01:05:01,233
Helping me through my grief

1515
01:05:01,367 --> 01:05:03,767
and some stuff
that I've been carrying around.

1516
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:04,934
I don't--
It's hard to explain.

1517
01:05:05,066 --> 01:05:06,100
This is a good thing.

1518
01:05:06,233 --> 01:05:08,767
It's a very good thing.

1519
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:11,266
I'm so happy for you
that there's someone out there

1520
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:13,100
that you can
share your feelings with.

1521
01:05:13,233 --> 01:05:14,133
These past 12 months,

1522
01:05:14,266 --> 01:05:17,767
there hasn't been
a single minute of the day

1523
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:21,467
that I haven't had a knot
in my stomach.

1524
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:23,266
I'm so worried about you, Nic.

1525
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:25,800
Hey. I'm gonna be okay.

1526
01:05:25,934 --> 01:05:27,166
All right?

1527
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:29,000
So don't worry about me anymore.

1528
01:05:29,133 --> 01:05:31,467
Really.
I'm going to be okay.

1529
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:32,433
Yeah.

1530
01:05:32,567 --> 01:05:33,433
Oh.

1531
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:36,633
Careful, you don't want
to smudge your lipstick

1532
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:38,066
before you meet
your mystery man.

1533
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,567
Gail. Don't even go there.

1534
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:41,567
Oh, I'm going there!

1535
01:05:43,266 --> 01:05:44,800
Have fun!

1536
01:06:01,033 --> 01:06:02,900
Oh, Nicole.

1537
01:06:03,033 --> 01:06:04,400
You're leaving?

1538
01:06:06,333 --> 01:06:09,033
Uh, yeah.
I'm meeting someone.

1539
01:06:09,166 --> 01:06:10,500
Oh.

1540
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:11,867
Anyway, I just thought
I'd come by

1541
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,033
and take a look
at those shelves,

1542
01:06:13,166 --> 01:06:15,800
but if you're busy,
I can come back another time?

1543
01:06:15,934 --> 01:06:16,900
Sounds good.

1544
01:06:20,266 --> 01:06:21,633
'Night.

1545
01:06:21,767 --> 01:06:23,033
Yeah, goodnight.

1546
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:30,700
What was that?

1547
01:06:31,867 --> 01:06:33,066
A goodnight kiss?

1548
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,367
A "goodnight kiss"
with a question mark?

1549
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:37,133
Uh, what?

1550
01:06:37,266 --> 01:06:40,400
Because that felt like
a kiss without a question mark.

1551
01:06:40,533 --> 01:06:43,734
I'm sorry I thought,
since we're friends now,

1552
01:06:43,867 --> 01:06:44,734
that I would--

1553
01:06:44,867 --> 01:06:45,900
You would, what?

1554
01:06:46,033 --> 01:06:48,033
Just turn a question mark
into an exclamation point?

1555
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,533
Y...eah?

1556
01:06:50,667 --> 01:06:52,734
W-W-Wait.
Where are you going?

1557
01:06:52,867 --> 01:06:54,233
To meet a friend.

1558
01:06:54,367 --> 01:06:56,000
And he is just a friend.
No question mark.

1559
01:06:56,133 --> 01:06:58,667
Yeah, that's-- that's great
that you have so many friends.

1560
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:02,900
And I suggest that you should
go meet a friend as well.

1561
01:07:03,033 --> 01:07:04,567
Well, it just so happens,
I am meeting a friend--

1562
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:05,800
exclamation point.

1563
01:07:05,934 --> 01:07:07,300
-Good.
-Yeah.

1564
01:07:11,166 --> 01:07:11,967
I didn't mean to do that.

1565
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:13,700
You didn't mean that,
question mark?

1566
01:07:13,834 --> 01:07:15,767
Because, to me, that felt
like two exclamation--

1567
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:16,900
Ugh.

1568
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:18,367
Say hi to your friend for me!

1569
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:19,433
My friend?

1570
01:07:19,567 --> 01:07:21,467
Uh, "friend"--
quotation marks.

1571
01:07:48,066 --> 01:07:49,433
"Something's come up.

1572
01:07:49,567 --> 01:07:50,800
I can't meet you.

1573
01:07:50,934 --> 01:07:52,800
I'm so sorry."

1574
01:08:04,967 --> 01:08:08,200
So, wait--
you got Henry's old number?

1575
01:08:08,333 --> 01:08:09,734
Wow.

1576
01:08:09,867 --> 01:08:12,433
That's a small world, huh?

1577
01:08:12,567 --> 01:08:15,400
Well... you know,
I think you should tell her.

1578
01:08:15,533 --> 01:08:17,333
You know me, Teddy.
I can't.

1579
01:08:17,467 --> 01:08:18,533
Why? She'll understand.

1580
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:21,667
I like her, Ted.

1581
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:23,567
You know,
in the beginning,

1582
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:24,767
she was someone
who was grieving

1583
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:28,066
and I was someone there
with a shoulder to lean on.

1584
01:08:29,233 --> 01:08:30,367
Became friends,

1585
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:31,433
and, through texting,

1586
01:08:31,567 --> 01:08:32,734
we found out that grief shared,

1587
01:08:32,867 --> 01:08:34,533
it was grief lessened.

1588
01:08:34,667 --> 01:08:36,333
But, Ted, I swear,

1589
01:08:36,467 --> 01:08:38,266
when I went to the restaurant
last night,

1590
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:40,834
I had-- I had no clue
it was her,

1591
01:08:40,967 --> 01:08:42,767
and at first, I was really happy
that it was her.

1592
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:44,867
When I saw her sitting there...

1593
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,567
she just looked so beautiful,

1594
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:48,000
waiting for the man

1595
01:08:48,133 --> 01:08:49,667
who helped put all
her broken pieces back together,

1596
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:50,867
but I-I couldn't
walk through that door.

1597
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,900
I couldn't take another step
and tell her it was me.

1598
01:08:53,033 --> 01:08:54,600
Why not?

1599
01:08:54,734 --> 01:08:56,000
How could she ever
trust me again?

1600
01:08:56,133 --> 01:08:57,433
If she knew

1601
01:08:57,567 --> 01:08:58,867
that I was the one she was
pouring her heart out to,

1602
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,800
I was the one
that was encouraging her

1603
01:09:00,934 --> 01:09:02,266
to move on from Henry...

1604
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:04,433
The last thing
I'd ever want to do,

1605
01:09:04,567 --> 01:09:05,633
after everything
she's been through,

1606
01:09:05,767 --> 01:09:07,834
is cause her any more pain.

1607
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:10,633
How could she ever believe
that I didn't know?

1608
01:09:10,767 --> 01:09:12,900
Yeah.

1609
01:09:13,033 --> 01:09:14,800
So what are you gonna do?

1610
01:09:19,367 --> 01:09:21,166
Give her that for me, please.

1611
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:29,066
Wait.
So he just didn't show up?

1612
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,233
No.

1613
01:09:30,367 --> 01:09:32,233
I waited and waited,

1614
01:09:32,367 --> 01:09:34,500
and then I got a text saying
that he couldn't come.

1615
01:09:34,633 --> 01:09:36,567
Well, so you'll make
another plan.

1616
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:37,934
Ah, I don't know.

1617
01:09:38,066 --> 01:09:39,400
I mean, it was hard enough

1618
01:09:39,533 --> 01:09:41,233
to get myself to go
in the first place.

1619
01:09:42,433 --> 01:09:43,767
Nic. Hey, hey, there you are.

1620
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:46,300
Uh, so, listen.

1621
01:09:46,433 --> 01:09:48,133
Joe wanted me
to give you this.

1622
01:09:48,266 --> 01:09:50,333
Oh.

1623
01:09:54,734 --> 01:09:56,233
Nicole,

1624
01:09:56,367 --> 01:09:58,567
I took another job out of town.
Sorry, I can't do your shelves.

1625
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:00,200
Merry Christmas. Joe.

1626
01:10:24,066 --> 01:10:26,433
Hey. I just wanted to clear
the rest of this stuff out

1627
01:10:26,567 --> 01:10:28,233
before I took off.

1628
01:10:28,367 --> 01:10:29,900
Thanks.

1629
01:10:30,033 --> 01:10:34,300
Well, anyway, I'm sorry I--
I gotta go,

1630
01:10:34,433 --> 01:10:37,000
but you know,
other job.

1631
01:10:37,133 --> 01:10:39,567
Sure. I understand.

1632
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:42,100
But before you go,

1633
01:10:42,233 --> 01:10:44,934
will you show me the house?

1634
01:10:49,033 --> 01:10:50,433
You want to go in?

1635
01:10:51,467 --> 01:10:53,233
Yeah.

1636
01:10:53,367 --> 01:10:55,100
I'm ready to do that now.

1637
01:11:23,367 --> 01:11:24,667
What do you think?

1638
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:28,100
It's perfect.

1639
01:11:45,967 --> 01:11:47,667
Well, I--
I'd better get going.

1640
01:11:49,834 --> 01:11:51,500
Merry Christmas, Nic.

1641
01:11:51,633 --> 01:11:53,433
Merry Christmas, Joe.

1642
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:56,900
Joe?

1643
01:11:57,033 --> 01:11:59,100
Wait. Um...

1644
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:04,500
I just would very much
like to have you in my life.

1645
01:12:05,767 --> 01:12:07,266
Sure, Nic.

1646
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:08,967
Sure.

1647
01:12:47,533 --> 01:12:49,633
Hey, Teddy. It's Nicole.

1648
01:12:49,767 --> 01:12:52,100
Uh, Joe left his phone
at my house today

1649
01:12:52,233 --> 01:12:54,133
and I don't think I'll be
seeing him anytime soon,

1650
01:12:54,266 --> 01:12:57,300
so I was wondering if
you could get it to him.

1651
01:12:57,433 --> 01:13:00,800
I will leave it in an envelope
at the shop for you.

1652
01:13:00,934 --> 01:13:02,533
All right.
Thanks, Teddy. Bye.

1653
01:13:05,133 --> 01:13:07,233
What? Mm.

1654
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:15,700
I was disappointed
I didn't get to meet you

1655
01:13:15,834 --> 01:13:16,867
the other night.

1656
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,033
I was gonna tell you
how thankful I am to you,

1657
01:13:20,166 --> 01:13:21,867
so I guess I'll do that now.

1658
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,133
Thank you for letting me
lean on you.

1659
01:13:24,266 --> 01:13:26,066
I will always be grateful.

1660
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:56,867
I know it was you.

1661
01:14:06,967 --> 01:14:08,400
Just sign here
and it's all yours.

1662
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:10,967
Wow!

1663
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:12,433
I am so happy for you.

1664
01:14:12,567 --> 01:14:13,667
Thank you.

1665
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:14,967
I mean, it's always been
a dream of mine

1666
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:16,800
to own a toy store.

1667
01:14:16,934 --> 01:14:18,333
But what about you?

1668
01:14:18,467 --> 01:14:20,433
What's next?

1669
01:14:26,066 --> 01:14:28,467
"Nic's Knits."

1670
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:30,967
Are you opening
an online store?

1671
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:33,433
Yeah. I figured, why not?

1672
01:14:33,567 --> 01:14:36,333
You remember Kim,
from Unique Styles?

1673
01:14:36,467 --> 01:14:37,633
Well, I gave her
a bunch of my designs

1674
01:14:37,767 --> 01:14:40,633
and she sold out of them
in 10 days.

1675
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:42,633
It made me realize that, yeah,

1676
01:14:42,767 --> 01:14:44,600
maybe I could turn this
into a business.

1677
01:14:44,734 --> 01:14:46,300
And I also realized

1678
01:14:46,433 --> 01:14:48,400
you don't have to see
the full staircase

1679
01:14:48,533 --> 01:14:50,266
to take the first step.

1680
01:14:51,433 --> 01:14:53,166
I'm so proud of you, Nic.

1681
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:55,000
You know, you've always
been my role model.

1682
01:14:55,133 --> 01:14:56,500
-Me?
-Yeah.

1683
01:14:56,633 --> 01:14:59,934
This last year,
everything you've been through--

1684
01:15:00,133 --> 01:15:01,934
you never let it defeat you.

1685
01:15:03,834 --> 01:15:05,567
It made me realize
what true strength is.

1686
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:07,767
Thank you, Teddy.

1687
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:10,800
Whew.

1688
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:18,967
You knew, didn't you?

1689
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:20,033
Knew what?

1690
01:15:20,166 --> 01:15:21,233
About Joe.

1691
01:15:21,367 --> 01:15:22,467
Texting me.

1692
01:15:24,033 --> 01:15:26,400
Look, I told him to tell you,
Nic.

1693
01:15:26,533 --> 01:15:28,266
I-I did.

1694
01:15:29,867 --> 01:15:30,867
He's not a bad guy.

1695
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,967
He didn't even know it was you
until he showed up

1696
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:34,467
at that restaurant
and saw you sitting there.

1697
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:36,300
That's just the thing.

1698
01:15:36,433 --> 01:15:39,333
He could've walked right in
and told me then.

1699
01:15:39,467 --> 01:15:40,734
But, instead, he let

1700
01:15:40,867 --> 01:15:43,633
the guy who helped me
through my grief

1701
01:15:43,767 --> 01:15:45,533
just leave me there,

1702
01:15:45,667 --> 01:15:48,000
feeling alone and confused.

1703
01:15:48,133 --> 01:15:50,500
I've known Joe a long time,

1704
01:15:50,633 --> 01:15:53,467
and he's someone
who knows about loss,

1705
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,533
knows how fragile people are,

1706
01:15:55,667 --> 01:15:58,300
and he just--
he didn't want to hurt you.

1707
01:15:58,433 --> 01:15:59,900
But he did.

1708
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:03,900
By not telling me the truth,
he hurt me.

1709
01:16:05,433 --> 01:16:08,633
But Nicole,
just ask yourself this--

1710
01:16:08,767 --> 01:16:10,433
did he help you?

1711
01:16:10,567 --> 01:16:12,767
Because, the way I see it...

1712
01:16:14,066 --> 01:16:16,033
...you're a new person now.

1713
01:16:16,166 --> 01:16:19,967
You're filled with life
and joy again,

1714
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:21,800
so he must've said
something right.

1715
01:16:36,867 --> 01:16:37,734
Hey.

1716
01:16:37,867 --> 01:16:39,300
Hi.

1717
01:16:39,433 --> 01:16:40,533
Hey.

1718
01:16:40,667 --> 01:16:42,300
I'm sorry.

1719
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:45,066
Of all the people in the world

1720
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:47,033
who could've gotten
Henry's number,

1721
01:16:47,166 --> 01:16:49,467
what are the odds
that it would be you?

1722
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:52,066
I mean, if that's not
a Christmas miracle,

1723
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:53,533
I don't know what is.

1724
01:16:53,667 --> 01:16:54,734
I wanted to tell you.

1725
01:16:54,867 --> 01:16:56,200
But you didn't.

1726
01:16:56,333 --> 01:16:58,033
I never meant to hurt you.

1727
01:16:58,166 --> 01:16:59,066
I would never hurt you.

1728
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:01,467
I-I can't figure you out, Joe.

1729
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:04,033
Which guy are you?

1730
01:17:04,166 --> 01:17:06,166
The one who turns his back
and leaves,

1731
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:09,200
or the one
who was the only person

1732
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:13,033
who seemed to understand
everything I was going through?

1733
01:17:13,166 --> 01:17:15,700
I am that guy, Nic.

1734
01:17:15,834 --> 01:17:18,533
And I am-- I meant
every single thing I wrote.

1735
01:17:18,667 --> 01:17:20,834
I just wanted you to move past
your grief,

1736
01:17:20,967 --> 01:17:23,633
to live your best life
and...

1737
01:17:23,767 --> 01:17:25,633
I want to live that best life
with you.

1738
01:17:25,767 --> 01:17:27,033
I...

1739
01:17:27,166 --> 01:17:29,333
We can start over.

1740
01:17:30,467 --> 01:17:31,367
We can't.

1741
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:33,233
Why not?

1742
01:17:33,367 --> 01:17:35,734
Because I don't know
if I can trust you.

1743
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:52,233
Finally! You're here.

1744
01:17:52,367 --> 01:17:54,467
Hi. Is he here?

1745
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:55,633
I told you,

1746
01:17:55,767 --> 01:17:56,734
he called and said
he's not coming.

1747
01:17:56,867 --> 01:17:58,900
Okay.

1748
01:17:59,033 --> 01:18:00,533
I know that you're really upset

1749
01:18:00,667 --> 01:18:02,967
about everything that happened
with Joe,

1750
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:04,467
but do you think
you could just put it aside,

1751
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:05,533
just for one day?

1752
01:18:05,667 --> 01:18:08,133
Maybe try to forget
about everything besides?

1753
01:18:08,266 --> 01:18:10,900
Today is my annual
Christmas Scavenger Hunt,

1754
01:18:11,033 --> 01:18:12,367
and you know what that means?

1755
01:18:13,533 --> 01:18:15,767
It's all about being
with people who love you

1756
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:17,767
and it's about
having some fun. Okay?

1757
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:18,867
-Okay.
-Gonna have some fun?

1758
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,700
-Yes.
-Okay!

1759
01:18:20,834 --> 01:18:22,266
Where is everyone?

1760
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:23,100
In the backyard.

1761
01:18:23,233 --> 01:18:24,633
The backyard?

1762
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:27,100
Well, it's a scavenger hunt.
Where else would they be?

1763
01:18:27,233 --> 01:18:29,700
Susan, it's 25 degrees outside.

1764
01:18:29,834 --> 01:18:31,967
I made cocoa!

1765
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:33,767
I can't believe
you're making us go outside.

1766
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:35,600
Come on!

1767
01:18:40,266 --> 01:18:41,700
It's so cold out!

1768
01:18:41,834 --> 01:18:43,567
A bit of a nip in the air--

1769
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:45,800
quite frankly,
I find it invigorating.

1770
01:18:45,934 --> 01:18:47,633
Can we please go inside?

1771
01:18:47,767 --> 01:18:51,133
Uh, no, we still haven't found
"the wrapped present."

1772
01:18:51,266 --> 01:18:53,934
Uh, Nicole, can you help Alan
find the wrapped present?

1773
01:18:54,066 --> 01:18:56,300
I would rather go inside
and wait for the cheese board.

1774
01:18:56,433 --> 01:18:57,567
That's against the rules.

1775
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:58,900
Please, help Alan
find the present.

1776
01:18:59,033 --> 01:19:00,600
-Go ahead.

1777
01:19:00,734 --> 01:19:02,266
She's so bossy.

1778
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,200
And you're just
realizing this now?

1779
01:19:05,433 --> 01:19:07,600
Wanna talk about it?

1780
01:19:07,734 --> 01:19:09,533
Not really.

1781
01:19:11,166 --> 01:19:12,100
You know, he should've told me

1782
01:19:12,233 --> 01:19:13,233
when he found out

1783
01:19:13,367 --> 01:19:15,867
that I was the one
he was sending those texts to.

1784
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:20,433
And just because
he didn't tell you,

1785
01:19:20,567 --> 01:19:23,166
does that make those words
any less beautiful?

1786
01:19:24,667 --> 01:19:25,800
The way I see it,

1787
01:19:25,934 --> 01:19:28,033
we're all just stumbling
through this life,

1788
01:19:28,166 --> 01:19:29,867
trying to figure things out.

1789
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,800
We fall down,
then we get back up again.

1790
01:19:33,967 --> 01:19:36,633
Everyone makes mistakes, Nic.

1791
01:19:38,133 --> 01:19:41,066
Don't let that be the reason
you give up on somebody.

1792
01:19:44,734 --> 01:19:46,800
Oh! There it is.

1793
01:19:46,934 --> 01:19:48,533
Ah!

1794
01:19:48,667 --> 01:19:50,033
Here we go.

1795
01:19:50,166 --> 01:19:51,667
Got it!

1796
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:54,100
Open it.

1797
01:19:55,900 --> 01:19:58,000
It's in the rules.

1798
01:19:58,133 --> 01:19:59,367
Okay.

1799
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:08,300
It's my house.

1800
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,600
It looks exactly like my house.

1801
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:16,200
Joe made it for you.

1802
01:20:17,633 --> 01:20:19,834
Said that, seeing as
you're selling your house,

1803
01:20:19,967 --> 01:20:21,000
you should at least
have something

1804
01:20:21,133 --> 01:20:23,300
to always remember it.

1805
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:29,233
Teddy, where is he?

1806
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,934
You're here.

1807
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,867
You did all of this?

1808
01:21:49,633 --> 01:21:52,100
I thought the lights could
maybe help sell the house.

1809
01:21:53,333 --> 01:21:55,367
I'm not selling the house.

1810
01:21:56,533 --> 01:21:57,533
No?

1811
01:21:57,667 --> 01:21:58,834
No.

1812
01:21:58,967 --> 01:22:00,600
Because of you,

1813
01:22:00,734 --> 01:22:04,467
I am gonna wake up
every Christmas morning

1814
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:06,500
in the beautiful house
that you built.

1815
01:22:07,533 --> 01:22:09,066
Because of you,

1816
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:10,300
I found someone

1817
01:22:10,433 --> 01:22:13,333
to lean on
when I couldn't heal myself.

1818
01:22:14,433 --> 01:22:17,000
Nicole, I'm sorry,
I should've told you when I--

1819
01:22:17,133 --> 01:22:18,166
when I first realized--
-No.

1820
01:22:20,066 --> 01:22:22,633
I spent the last year of my life

1821
01:22:22,767 --> 01:22:25,767
only thinking
about what happened.

1822
01:22:25,900 --> 01:22:29,233
Playing it over and over
in my head,

1823
01:22:29,367 --> 01:22:30,433
again and again.

1824
01:22:31,934 --> 01:22:33,400
I was stuck,

1825
01:22:33,533 --> 01:22:36,633
but then you came into my life

1826
01:22:36,767 --> 01:22:39,266
and you showed me
how to push forward...

1827
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:43,633
...how to move past
what happened before,

1828
01:22:43,767 --> 01:22:46,734
and focus on
what's happening right here,

1829
01:22:46,867 --> 01:22:48,633
right now.

1830
01:22:48,767 --> 01:22:50,600
And...

1831
01:22:50,734 --> 01:22:52,967
what exactly is happening

1832
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:54,667
right now?

1833
01:22:56,066 --> 01:22:57,166
Wait.

1834
01:22:57,300 --> 01:22:59,033
Wait, uh...

1835
01:23:14,967 --> 01:23:16,567
So what score would you
give that kiss?

1836
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:19,233
Mm. Say a 9.5.

1837
01:23:19,367 --> 01:23:21,233
Only a 9.5?

1838
01:23:21,367 --> 01:23:23,700
Well, kiss me again.
Let's make it a 10.
