You didn't have them the other day.

104
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:33,625
Nina, you gotta put something on her

That robe.

106
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,125
You gotta put something on her.

-[young Leda] What?

140
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,833
[girl 1] We should stick
googly eyes on his face,

141
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:34,041
and we should put him in a cage
and decorate the cage.

-No, I'm fine here.

00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:41,083
You do us this favor today,
we'll do a favor for you tomorrow.

178
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,500
No, thank you.

179
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:45,000
-Cunt!
-[laughter]

180
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,833
Honestly, I don't even know
what to say to you.

181
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:51,250
It's just moving
down the beach a few feet.

182
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,791
-This fucking…
-That's enough.

183
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:54,625
I'm sorry.

184
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,875
[indistinct conversation]

185
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,666
[people on the beach singing]

186
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:17,250
We put you on a diet
and you're eating all this cake.

187
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,458
[speaks indistinctly]

188
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,625
-You want a piece of cake?
-Oh, thank you. No.

189
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,458
[woman] I'm sorry about earlier.
All right?

190
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,000
It's my birthday.

191
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,791
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

192
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,208
-How old are you?
-I'm 42.

193
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,458
[Leda] You got a lovely big belly.

194
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:49,208
Well, it's a girl. So, you know.

195
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,291
-And how much longer have you got?
-[woman] Two months.

196
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,000
My sister-in-law had hers right away.

197
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:57,916
Took me eight years.

198
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,333
These things happen
when they're supposed to happen.

199
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,125
-Have a great birthday.
-Where you from?

200
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:09,166
I'm from Cambridge, near Boston.

201
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,375
No, I mean, where are your people from?

202
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,333
-My people?
-Yeah.

203
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:19,083
Are from Leeds. Well, Shipley, really.

204
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,625
-Fancy.
-No, it's not fancy.

205
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:25,875
I thought you were from Queens. I swear.

206
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:29,500
Not 'cause you talk like it,
but just, like… something.

207
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,041
That's where we're mostly from,

208
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:35,125
but we have family
in this town for, like, 300 years.

209
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,375
Oh.

210
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:37,375
[woman] Uh…

211
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,166
You don't have kids?

212
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:41,458
Yes, I have two daughters.

213
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,625
[woman] Where are they?

214
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,416
[exhales]

215
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,541
[woman] How old are they?

216
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,791
Uh, Bianca is 25 and Martha is 23.

217
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:52,875
[woman] No!

218
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:56,500
I mean, you're too young.
You must've started really early.

219
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,208
[Leda] I'm 48.

220
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,625
Shit. No.

221
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:02,500
You look amazing.

222
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:05,916
We were saying before,
you couldn't be more than 40.

223
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,208
Damn, you're lucky.

224
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,250
-What's your name?
-Leda.

225
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,666
-Neda?
-Leda.

226
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,083
Leda. Leda what?

227
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:15,625
Caruso.

228
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:18,375
Oh! Caruso from Queens.

229
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,416
I'm Callie.

230
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:22,875
Callisto.

231
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:25,666
It means the most beautiful.

232
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,750
You're not gonna have a bite?
Not even one bite?

233
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,916
-Oh.
-How can you hold cake and not eat it?

234
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,125
-[chuckles]
-Mmm.

235
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,708
-It's good, right?
-It's really good.

236
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:36,666
Yeah.

237
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:39,083
Um…

238
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:43,750
Look, I'm sorry about earlier as well.
I was feeling a bit anxious.

239
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:47,375
Yeah, well, you know, the sun can do that.

240
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:52,208
And, well, maybe your girls.
Being away from your girls, you know?

241
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:55,208
Yeah, well, you'll see.

242
00:21:56,625 --> 00:22:01,416
Children are a crushing responsibility.

243
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:05,416
Happy birthday.

244
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,041
[twig snaps]

245
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:22,375
[cockrell crows]

246
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:31,125
-[thud]
-[shrieks and groans]

247
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:40,500
Oh.

248
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:58,416
[inhales sharply]

249
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:02,666
[blues music playing]

250
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
[indistinct chatter in distance]

251
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:44,875
-Hi. Hello.
-Lyle. From upstairs.

252
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:47,416
-Yeah, of course.
-I'm glad you made it down here.

253
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:50,708
-It's not so bad, right?
-No.

254
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:52,791
-I hope we didn't disturb you.
-[Leda] Oh, no, no.

255
00:23:54,541 --> 00:23:55,916
What are you drinking?

256
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,833
Oh, I'm fine. I'm still half full.

257
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:02,750
Nice to have a place like this,
just down the stairs.

258
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:06,208
You know, especially when you're alone.

259
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:11,416
-Keeps you from eating canned beans.
-Or rotten fruit.

260
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,583
[both laughing]

261
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:18,375
-Uh, I forget to eat entirely sometimes.
-Oh, that's not good.

262
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:25,625
I saw you at the beach today.
Callie's birthday party.

263
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:28,750
Oh, well, I wasn't exactly at the party.
I didn't see you.

264
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:29,875
I saw you.

265
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,416
-You know, you're settling in upstairs?
-Yeah. It's great. Thanks.

266
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:39,333
-Yeah? Everything's okay in the apartment?
-Yeah, it's great. Thank you.

267
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:42,416
Did you find that remote?
You know, for the fan?

268
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:45,166
No, I prefer
to pull the string to turn it on.

269
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,166
-The fan.
-[laughing] Pull.

270
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:49,666
Pulling the ol' string, eh?

271
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,250
[both chuckling]

272
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,791
[Lyle sighs]

273
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:56,708
-The apartment's great.
-It's a good one.

274
00:24:56,791 --> 00:24:58,000
Bright and white.

275
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,416
-Feels like you're on a boat almost.
-Yes.

276
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:05,625
-[Lyle] No, no, I got it.
-Oh, no, really.

277
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:07,375
-I insist.
-Oh, thank you.

278
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:14,666
Just let me know
if I can do anything for you.

279
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,750
I will. Thank you.

280
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:22,958
Do you mind
if I finish my dinner now, Lyle?

281
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:24,958
Oh, sure.

282
00:25:28,666 --> 00:25:29,791
[sighing]

283
00:25:30,833 --> 00:25:32,208
-Yeah.
-Okay.

284
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:36,583
[men conversing indistinctly]

285
00:26:11,291 --> 00:26:13,041
[speaks Italian] A beautiful game.

286
00:26:17,833 --> 00:26:18,833
[in English] Sorry.

[men conversing indistinctly]

288
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:27,583
[Nina] Damn it!

289
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,500
You do whatever the fuck you want.
You wanna take care of your baby girl?

290
00:26:34,583 --> 00:26:35,458
You say you miss us.

291
00:26:35,541 --> 00:26:37,958
You wanna come back and you want me.
You want this ass?

292
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:45,541
What? You're such a piece of shit.

293
00:26:45,625 --> 00:26:47,125
[Nina's husband] I'm a piece of shit?

294
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:50,041

[Nina] Elena?

298
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,416
Elena!

299

300
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:49,875
Elena?

301
00:27:52,416 --> 00:27:53,250
Lena.

302

Come on.

Oh, my God!

God!

336
00:30:02,916 --> 00:30:03,750
Give her to me.

345
00:30:31,833 --> 00:30:33,166

Yeah.

347
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:38,041
Thank God you were here. Thank God.

348
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:41,625
Sometimes it's easier for strangers
in these situations.

349
00:30:41,708 --> 00:30:44,333
[Callie] Yeah, I was so crazy,
I couldn't see right.

350
00:30:44,416 --> 00:30:47,083
You know, so many awful things can happen.

351
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:49,250
People are so fucked up. [gasps]

352
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:50,875
Oh, my God.

353
00:30:51,708 --> 00:30:53,250
What happened to your back?

354
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:56,958
-It was a pine cone from the beach path.
-[Callie] A pine cone?

355
00:30:57,666 --> 00:31:00,083
That looks so awful.
Did you put something on it?

356
00:31:00,166 --> 00:31:01,291
[Leda] No, I haven't.

357
00:31:01,375 --> 00:31:03,625
Oh, no. No. Oh, I have something for you.

358
00:31:03,708 --> 00:31:05,125
It's so good. Hold on.

359
00:31:08,958 --> 00:31:11,125
-I like your bathing suit.
-[Leda] Oh, thank you.

360
00:31:11,208 --> 00:31:12,333
[Nina] Mm-hmm.

361
00:31:12,416 --> 00:31:14,750
-[Elena crying]
-So she's not calming down?

362
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,500
Yeah.

363
00:31:18,583 --> 00:31:20,250
[crying] Mommy!

364
00:31:20,333 --> 00:31:21,916
-[Nina's husband] Stop.
-[Nina] Weird day.

365
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,166
[Leda] Hmm.

366
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,208
We found her and then she lost

367
00:31:26,291 --> 00:31:27,250
her doll.

368
00:31:29,833 --> 00:31:32,625
I used to have a doll like that.
Called Mina.

369
00:31:32,708 --> 00:31:34,625
-Nina?
-Mina.

370
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:37,416
Or Mini-Mama, as my mother called her.

371
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:39,750
You'll find it.

372
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:42,625
-Yeah.
-[woman] Do you want a toy?

373
00:31:42,708 --> 00:31:45,083
-[indistinct chatter]
-[Elena continues crying]

374
00:31:55,125 --> 00:31:57,375
-[Callie] How's that?
-[Leda] Good, thank you. It's cold.

375
00:31:57,458 --> 00:32:02,083
[Callie] Yes. It's really amazing.
It's gonna make you feel so much better.

376
00:32:02,166 --> 00:32:05,666
Okay, by tonight,
you're gonna feel amazing.

377
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,750
-All right? All right.
-Thank you. Yeah.

378
00:32:07,833 --> 00:32:10,291
[Callie] And let's go.
Let's find the doll.

379
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:12,500
I… I can't hear her scream anymore.

380
00:32:15,666 --> 00:32:16,583
See you tomorrow.

381
00:32:19,375 --> 00:32:20,666
[Elena crying] Mama!

382
00:32:22,125 --> 00:32:23,083
-Bye.
-[Leda] Bye.

383
00:32:36,708 --> 00:32:39,291
[cicadas chirping]

384
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,333
[young Leda whispers]
I've got a special gift for you.

385
00:33:05,041 --> 00:33:06,125
Open your eyes.

386
00:33:08,041 --> 00:33:09,041
Hmm?

387
00:33:09,833 --> 00:33:12,583
This was Mama's doll
when she was a little girl.

388
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:15,541
-[Bianca] What's her name?
-Her name's Mina.

389
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:19,166
-[Bianca] Mummy?
-[Leda] Mm-hmm.

390
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:22,708
-[Bianca] Can I have a cuddle?
-[chuckling] You can have a cuddle.

391
00:33:26,083 --> 00:33:27,375
Aw.

392
00:33:28,666 --> 00:33:30,666
[thunder rumbling]

393
00:33:35,083 --> 00:33:37,666
[Bianca] Give you some medicine

394
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:43,250
because then you'll have nice nails.

395
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:44,458
Yeah.

396
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:49,125
[Bianca] Very messy.
And you won't get better.

397
00:33:49,208 --> 00:33:50,291
[Leda] Mm-hmm.

398
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:53,666
I'm just gonna close my eyes
for a few seconds, baby. Okay?

399
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:54,625
[Bianca] Okay.

400
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:57,583
Can you see what my eye color is?

401
00:33:57,666 --> 00:34:00,208
-Hmm. Brown?
-[Bianca] No.

402
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:01,916
They're red.

403
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:04,166
-Do you see?
-[Leda] Yeah.

404
00:34:07,791 --> 00:34:11,750
[Bianca] Uh, I'll just
have to brush your hair.

405
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:22,416
Ow! Fuck! Ouch!

406
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:24,291
Bianca, no!

407
00:34:25,583 --> 00:34:26,541
Ouch.

408
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:30,125
[Martha crying]

409
00:34:30,875 --> 00:34:34,208
-You said we would have a date.
-I can't just let her cry.

410
00:34:34,291 --> 00:34:38,666
You've got to… I'll give you
a few more seconds to come back.

411
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:43,375
Three, two, one.

412
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,750
[Martha continues crying]

413
00:34:51,041 --> 00:34:52,041
[sighs]

414
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:55,583
[Bianca crying]

415
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:03,166
Here. Why don't you play with Mini-Mama?

416
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,958
You can brush her hair, yeah?

417
00:35:06,625 --> 00:35:10,041
-[Martha] Oh, Mama, come!
-I'll be back in two seconds.

418
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:11,625
[Martha crying]

419
00:35:12,125 --> 00:35:13,125
[brush clatters]

420
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:18,500
[young Leda] Bianca?

421
00:35:21,458 --> 00:35:22,375
Bianca!

422
00:35:22,916 --> 00:35:24,666
[Bianca speaking indistinctly]

423
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,791
[Leda] Bianca! Come on! Dinner.

424
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:30,625
[Bianca] That seems fine.

425
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,375
Are you ignoring me?

426
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:35,416
I've called you so many times for dinner.

427
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:37,833
-[speaking indistinctly]
-Bianca?

428
00:35:38,458 --> 00:35:40,583
What are you sitting on? Bianca!

429
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:44,083
Get up.

430
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:47,708
Get up. Get up.

431
00:35:50,666 --> 00:35:51,916
[Leda] You don't like her?

432
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:55,000
I gave Mina to you
because I trusted you to take care of her.

433
00:35:55,083 --> 00:35:57,166
You know, you can be very thoughtless.

434
00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:00,458
This is my doll.
You can't treat her like shit.

435
00:36:00,541 --> 00:36:02,375
No. She's mine.

436
00:36:03,958 --> 00:36:05,750
Yeah, well, she's ruined.

437
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,916
[wind blowing]

438
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,666
[thunder rumbling]

439
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:22,291
[rain pattering]

440
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:54,875
-Oh, hi!
-Hi.

441
00:36:56,416 --> 00:36:59,083
-You look like you stayed dry.
-Yeah, was it really bad?

442
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:00,458
Yeah. No, it was crazy.

443
00:37:00,541 --> 00:37:03,791
Everybody ran into the cafe,
and then it got too crowded.

444
00:37:03,875 --> 00:37:06,916
Umbrellas started blowing away,
people's books, towels, yeah.

445
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,083
-Everyone was freaking out.
-Oh, dear.

446
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:14,083
Yeah, and the little girl, Elena,
she just… she wouldn't stop crying.

447
00:37:14,166 --> 00:37:16,458
Yeah, she lost her doll or something.

448
00:37:17,125 --> 00:37:18,583
-I like storms.
-[Will] Mmm.

449
00:37:18,666 --> 00:37:21,000
Yeah, well, your books
woulda gotten ruined.

450
00:37:21,083 --> 00:37:22,916
-Oh, did yours get wet?
-Yeah.

451
00:37:23,666 --> 00:37:24,791
What are you studying?

452
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:26,625
-Business.
-In Greek?

453
00:37:26,708 --> 00:37:28,541
No, no, I'm studying in Dublin,

454
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:31,041
and I just work here
for the summers, but, uh…

455
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,833
Yeah, I'm a bit behind at college.

456
00:37:34,916 --> 00:37:37,833
You know, I wasted a lot of time.

457
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:40,125
-Yeah.
-How old are you?

458
00:37:40,208 --> 00:37:42,916
-Twenty-four.
-Oh, right between my daughters.

459
00:37:43,833 --> 00:37:45,041
I heard you're a professor.

460
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:47,541
[chuckles] I think the correct response
is, "Sounds like fun."

461
00:37:47,625 --> 00:37:50,125
-[chuckling] What?
-It's a rude joke.

462
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:53,166
-Will sandwich. Yeah.
-[Will chuckles]

463
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:55,166
Uh, I teach, yeah.

464
00:37:55,875 --> 00:37:58,125
Yeah. Comp lit.
Italian literature, really.

465
00:37:58,208 --> 00:37:59,666
-All right.
-But I'm skiving off.

466
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:02,250
Right, right, ahem, yeah,
comparative literature.

467
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:03,833
Mmm. Yeah.

468
00:38:04,541 --> 00:38:07,916
-I saw you know a lot of languages?
-I don't know anything very well.

469
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,125
I also wasted a lot of time. [chuckles]

470
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,833
Do you wanna have dinner with me?

471
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:17,458
Yeah, I should go shower and change and--

472
00:38:17,541 --> 00:38:18,583
No, you're fine as you are.

473
00:38:18,666 --> 00:38:21,333
-I don't have my wallet.
-Uh, I'm inviting you. Come on.

474
00:38:21,416 --> 00:38:22,583
Okay.

475
00:38:22,666 --> 00:38:24,291
[both laughing]

476
00:38:28,208 --> 00:38:30,500
-That was so funny.
-[coughing]

477
00:38:30,583 --> 00:38:32,583
Vassili is Callie's husband.

478
00:38:32,666 --> 00:38:35,500
Oh, I thought he was married
to the older, heavyset woman.

479
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:37,541
-Oh, come on.
-What?

480
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:39,666
-She's fat.
-[gasps]

481
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,875
No, but that's Callie's aunt, I think.

482
00:38:42,458 --> 00:38:45,250
-And Lyle, who looks after my place.
-He works for them.

483
00:38:45,333 --> 00:38:47,041
-Oh…
-Mmm.

484
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:50,291
-And Nina's husband is…
-Toni.

485
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:52,458
-Toni?
-Yeah.

486
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:55,666
Yeah, he, um, comes up the weekends.

487
00:38:56,541 --> 00:38:58,916
He has investments in Kalamata.

488
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,208
-Sounds dodgy.
-Yeah. Mmm.

489
00:39:01,291 --> 00:39:04,541
And then they all rent
one of these huge villas by the cliffs.

490
00:39:05,666 --> 00:39:06,916
It's pink.

491
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,458
-It's pink?
-Yeah.

492
00:39:08,541 --> 00:39:10,958
-[both chuckles]
-They rent the same one every year.

493
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:15,583
Wow, it's like talking about a film I saw
in a language I didn't quite understand.

494
00:39:15,666 --> 00:39:17,541
You watch movies
in languages you don't know?

495
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:19,458
-Yeah.
-Without subtitles?

496
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:20,416
Yeah.

497
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,833
[both laughing]

498
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:27,125
And you were saying that,
um, your kids are my age?

499
00:39:27,208 --> 00:39:29,708
Yeah, 25 and 23. Bianca and Martha.

500
00:39:29,791 --> 00:39:32,958
Hmm. And do they look like you?

501
00:39:33,041 --> 00:39:35,833
I don't know. It's hard to say,
if I'm honest. They probably do.

502
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:36,916
Oh.

503
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,250
Because you're beautiful.

504
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:39,750
[both chuckles]

505
00:39:40,958 --> 00:39:42,958
-You're a very smart boy.
-[both chuckle]

506
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:45,791
My mother was very beautiful.

507
00:39:46,291 --> 00:39:50,625
And, um, when I was about Martha's age,
I felt like she hadn't shared it.

508
00:39:50,708 --> 00:39:53,083
Like, in creating me
she'd separated herself,

509
00:39:53,166 --> 00:39:56,291
like pushing a plate away
if the food's repulsive.

510
00:39:56,375 --> 00:39:58,500
-[Will] Hmm.
-[Leda] Hmm.

511
00:39:58,583 --> 00:40:00,291
But Bianca and Martha, it's funny.

512
00:40:00,375 --> 00:40:04,625
What I find most interesting
are the secret resemblances.

513
00:40:04,708 --> 00:40:05,791
-[Will] Hmm.
-You know?

514
00:40:06,291 --> 00:40:09,500
So what makes Bianca seductive
and Martha not, and vice versa.

515
00:40:09,583 --> 00:40:10,708
Well, they blame me.

516
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,208
Like, when I was younger,
I had small breasts.

517
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:18,583
And then as soon as I gave birth,
big breasts.

518
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:23,541
And Bianca has big breasts,
and Martha has almost none, like a boy.

519
00:40:24,291 --> 00:40:27,375
And she doesn't realize
how beautiful she is.

520
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:30,500
And she wears a padded bra
and it sort of humiliates her.

521
00:40:31,208 --> 00:40:34,208
And she thinks
I've given the best of myself to Bianca.

522
00:40:34,291 --> 00:40:35,541
She feels deprived.

523
00:40:36,541 --> 00:40:39,833
And, um, I do understand. And, like…

524
00:40:40,583 --> 00:40:42,791
Long time ago,
at some point, I considered,

525
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:45,625
only half seriously,
considered having implants.

526
00:40:45,708 --> 00:40:51,125
But, um, they come from nowhere,
so what are they worth?

527
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:52,916
You know?

528
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:56,041
But Bianca is completely different,

529
00:40:56,125 --> 00:40:58,500
and she would never
let herself feel deprived.

530
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:02,333
She sucks everything out of me.
All my secret skills.

531
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:06,083
She pointed out
I'm finicky about peeling fruit.

532
00:41:06,166 --> 00:41:07,000
[Will] Hmm.

533
00:41:07,083 --> 00:41:08,583
I don't like it when the peel breaks.

534
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:11,833
I like when it comes off
in one long whatsit?

535
00:41:11,916 --> 00:41:14,166
-[WIll] String… [chuckles]
-String. [chuckles]

536
00:41:15,125 --> 00:41:17,250
-Yeah, very, very uptight.
-Yeah. [laughing]

537
00:41:17,333 --> 00:41:19,208
Didn't even know that about myself.

538
00:41:21,333 --> 00:41:24,041
-Yeah, of course I understand.
-[young Leda muttering]

539
00:41:24,125 --> 00:41:27,708
The problem for me is why did they
schedule them so close together?

540
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:30,875
[young Leda muttering]

541
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,041
Baby… Babe…

542
00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:37,166
Huh?

543
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:39,750
-[girls crying in distance]
-[whispers] It's Sunday. You're on.

544
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:41,750
[whispers] It's Columbia.

545
00:41:48,625 --> 00:41:50,666
[muffled]

546
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,500
[crying in distance]

547
00:41:52,583 --> 00:41:54,916
[speaking indistinctly]

548
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,041
I'm working.

549
00:41:56,125 --> 00:41:57,625
I'm suffocating.

550
00:41:58,375 --> 00:42:01,541
-[crying] Please, can you kiss it?
-[Leda] Yeah, sit down.

551
00:42:01,625 --> 00:42:06,041
-Mama, please, can you kiss it?
-Sit down.

552
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:07,458
[clicking tongue]

553
00:42:07,541 --> 00:42:08,708
What did you do that for?

554
00:42:08,791 --> 00:42:14,083
I wanted to peel it
like a snake like you do. [sniffles]

555
00:42:15,375 --> 00:42:18,458
Please. Please, can you kiss it?

556
00:42:19,208 --> 00:42:21,416
It really hurts.

557
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:25,791
Mama! [crying]

558
00:42:28,208 --> 00:42:29,833
Kiss it.

559
00:42:30,916 --> 00:42:34,791
[crying] Please. [sniffles]

560
00:42:35,625 --> 00:42:38,958
Please.

561
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:42,125
[Bianca continues crying]

562
00:42:48,416 --> 00:42:50,583
[young Leda] I can't leave you alone
for one minute.

563
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:53,750
[Bianca continues crying]

564
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:59,583
There's this great poem by María Guerra.

565
00:42:59,666 --> 00:43:01,625
"Haciendo serpentinas"?

566
00:43:02,833 --> 00:43:04,333
[Will hesitates] No.

567
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:06,375
Have you ever read "Leda and the Swan"?

568
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:07,750
No.

569
00:43:07,833 --> 00:43:09,541
Okay. That's in English.

570
00:43:09,625 --> 00:43:12,041
-Okay.
-Plus, it's my namesake.

571
00:43:12,666 --> 00:43:14,166
"The center cannot hold…"

572
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:16,958
Oh, that's a different…
that's a different Yeats.

573
00:43:18,541 --> 00:43:19,583
Um…

574
00:43:24,166 --> 00:43:25,208
[grunts]

575
00:43:26,208 --> 00:43:28,041
My mum used to get quite dizzy.

576
00:43:28,125 --> 00:43:31,000
She, um… Every time she stood up,
happened all the time.

577
00:43:31,083 --> 00:43:33,125
She said it's 'cause
she stood up too fast.

578
00:43:36,958 --> 00:43:39,291
Oh, poor creatures
that came out of my belly.

579
00:43:39,375 --> 00:43:43,125
The bits I find most beautiful about them
are the bits that are alien to me.

580
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:46,083
So I don't have
to take responsibility for that.

581
00:43:49,791 --> 00:43:51,583
-Have I bored you?
-No.

582
00:43:51,666 --> 00:43:53,333
Nina's very beautiful.

583
00:43:56,041 --> 00:43:56,958
Yes.

584
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:02,416
I hope they find the doll.

585
00:44:03,208 --> 00:44:05,250
They're all freaking out and…

586
00:44:06,291 --> 00:44:08,583
I had to rake
the entire beach looking for it.

587
00:44:08,666 --> 00:44:09,916
-They will.
-Hmm.

588
00:44:11,833 --> 00:44:13,708
What you did yesterday was amazing.

589
00:44:14,666 --> 00:44:16,750
When you wouldn't move from the umbrella.

590
00:44:18,666 --> 00:44:21,750
-But don't do things like that anymore.
-Why?

591
00:44:21,833 --> 00:44:22,791
[clicks tongue]

592
00:44:23,541 --> 00:44:25,166
Because they're bad people.

593
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:46,750
[sniffs]

594
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:00,250
[groans]

595
00:45:02,875 --> 00:45:03,750
Ugh!

596
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,250
[vehicle approaching]

597
00:45:18,041 --> 00:45:20,041
[indistinct chatter in distance]

598
00:45:59,083 --> 00:46:01,708
[young Leda] Sometimes I get scared
I can't take care of them.

599
00:46:03,916 --> 00:46:07,000
What if I passed out,
alone with them when you're in Arizona?

600
00:46:07,875 --> 00:46:10,458
[man] Baby, you're okay.

601
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:12,333
I promise.

602
00:46:13,791 --> 00:46:15,625
Of course you can take care of them.

603
00:46:33,083 --> 00:46:37,625
I'm just gonna take the dress
and the shoes and the socks.

604
00:46:37,708 --> 00:46:39,666
And leave the… Oh, no.

605
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:42,083
Actually, I'm gonna
take the jacket too. Thank you.

606
00:46:46,666 --> 00:46:47,666
Leda.

607
00:46:50,333 --> 00:46:51,541
-Hi.
-Hi.

608
00:46:52,333 --> 00:46:55,083
-How are you?
-Good.

609
00:46:56,541 --> 00:46:58,083
Do you have grandkids already?

610
00:46:58,750 --> 00:46:59,916
No.

611
00:47:00,666 --> 00:47:02,541
Did you use the ointment I gave you?

612
00:47:02,625 --> 00:47:04,666
Oh, for my back.
Yeah, it feels much better.

613
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:05,875
-Thank you.
-Oh, good.

614
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:11,375
Hey. Hey, sweetie,
did you ever find your doll?

615
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,041
-[Callie] Oh, my God.
-Elena, do not do that.

616
00:47:15,125 --> 00:47:16,291
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

617
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:18,500
[Nina] She's super tired.

618
00:47:19,083 --> 00:47:22,000
Why don't you tell the lady
how we're gonna go

619
00:47:22,083 --> 00:47:25,708
and find Neni tomorrow
when it's not raining, right, honey?

620
00:47:25,791 --> 00:47:28,791
And then today
we're gonna get a doll for a big girl.

621
00:47:28,875 --> 00:47:32,041
'Cause you're Mommy's big girl.
You're my big girl.

622
00:47:32,125 --> 00:47:34,000
Whoever took her should get brain cancer.

623
00:47:34,083 --> 00:47:36,583
[Vassili] Oh, come on.
It's kids' stuff, you understand?

624
00:47:36,666 --> 00:47:38,375
They like a toy, they take it. That's it.

625
00:47:38,458 --> 00:47:40,291
[Callie] No, Arruno's children
aren't like kids.

626
00:47:40,375 --> 00:47:42,416
Yeah, it's their mom. She's a cunt.

627
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:45,458
[Vassili] I spoke to Toni
and the kids didn't take anything.

628
00:47:45,958 --> 00:47:47,541
-He's lying.
-[Vassili] Don't say that.

629
00:47:47,625 --> 00:47:50,000
-Well, it's true.
-Don't say it.

630
00:47:50,083 --> 00:47:52,333
[Callie] She's been through
a lot, you know?

631
00:47:52,416 --> 00:47:55,541
She's, like, had a fever,
she can't breathe at night.

632
00:47:55,625 --> 00:47:58,166
She needs a Kleenex. We're furious.

633
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,875
-Do you have a Kleenex, actually?
-No, I don't. Sorry.

634
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:07,083
How high was the temperature?

635
00:48:07,166 --> 00:48:09,916
Barely 100. She's… She's okay.

636
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:11,833
She's okay.

637
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:17,916
[Nina] Okay, you wanna let Mama
put you down for a second?

638
00:48:19,333 --> 00:48:20,666
[chuckles]

639
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:24,000
Come on.
Elena, let Mama put you down. Come on.

640
00:48:26,166 --> 00:48:27,958
-[Elena grunts]
-Stop. Stop it.

641
00:48:28,041 --> 00:48:31,833
Enough. Stop. Enough!
Stop acting like this. Let me…

642
00:48:32,916 --> 00:48:33,750
Fuck!

643
00:48:34,958 --> 00:48:37,250
[breathing heavily]

644
00:48:41,916 --> 00:48:43,750
[sighs] She's driving me crazy.

645
00:48:45,083 --> 00:48:46,333
'Cause Daddy's away, right?

646
00:48:46,416 --> 00:48:49,541
Daddy's away,
and you're taking it out on me.

647
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:54,458
All right. Come to Auntie, baby.
Come on. Come to Auntie.

648
00:48:54,541 --> 00:48:57,708
There we go, my big girl. Oh! [grunts]

649
00:48:57,791 --> 00:49:00,583
-My big girl!
-Go. So I can have a minute.

650
00:49:02,125 --> 00:49:04,250
Sometimes I just can't handle it.

651
00:49:05,416 --> 00:49:07,666
-I know.
-[Callie] Okay?

652
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:11,833
-[Elena speaks indistinctly]
-Yes, anything you want. Show Mama.

653
00:49:11,916 --> 00:49:15,291
Show Mama and the lady
what a good girl you are, okay?

654
00:49:15,375 --> 00:49:16,250
Here you go.

655
00:49:17,041 --> 00:49:19,625
You're okay. [kisses] You're okay.

656
00:49:22,041 --> 00:49:23,333
[exhales sharply]

657
00:49:24,291 --> 00:49:26,125
They really put us through it, huh?

658
00:49:27,708 --> 00:49:30,083
I thought you said
you're pregnant with your first.

659
00:49:30,166 --> 00:49:31,291
[Callie] I am.

660
00:49:31,875 --> 00:49:34,166
What were your daughters like
when they were little?

661
00:49:34,833 --> 00:49:36,958
Were they like
this willful little creature?

662
00:49:37,583 --> 00:49:39,750
I honestly can't remember much, actually.

663
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:44,083
[Callie] Oh, no, you can't forget
anything about your own children.

664
00:49:45,875 --> 00:49:47,083
Is that your experience?

665
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:53,333
I just mean, did your daughters give you
a hard time when they were little?

666
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:56,333
I just don't remember.

667
00:49:58,041 --> 00:50:00,333
-[Callie] You okay?
-She doesn't remember.

668
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:02,375
[Leda] I was very tired.

669
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:04,000
Sorry, excuse me.

670
00:50:04,083 --> 00:50:06,791
[objects clattering]

671
00:50:09,708 --> 00:50:10,541
Sorry.

672
00:50:10,625 --> 00:50:13,625
Don't bother buying her another doll.
It won't make any difference.

673
00:50:14,208 --> 00:50:15,083
You'll find it.

674
00:50:17,291 --> 00:50:19,083
[thunder rumbling]

675
00:50:19,166 --> 00:50:22,166
-[rain pattering]
-[people clamoring]

676
00:50:31,708 --> 00:50:33,333
[in Italian] Stiamo disturbando…

677
00:50:33,416 --> 00:50:35,791
[repeating in Italian] Stiamo disturbando…

678
00:50:36,583 --> 00:50:39,375
-[young Leda speaking Italian]
-[repeating in Italian]

679
00:50:39,458 --> 00:50:41,916
[young Leda speaking Italian]

680
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,541
[Bianca in English]
Mama, how do you write "volcano"?

681
00:50:45,458 --> 00:50:47,958
[young Leda] …dal nostro intento…

682
00:50:48,041 --> 00:50:50,000
Mama, how do you write "volcano"?

683
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:57,416
Mama. Is this how you write "volcano"?
Is this how you write "volcano"?

684
00:50:59,833 --> 00:51:00,750
[young Leda] Su te…

685
00:51:00,833 --> 00:51:02,583
-How do you--
-[in English] Don't do that!

686
00:51:05,041 --> 00:51:07,666
-Don't you dare, ever again, Bianca.
-[chuckles]

687
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:09,833
Listen to me. Don't you dare, ever again.

688
00:51:11,375 --> 00:51:12,541
[Bianca laughs]

689
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:16,208
You don't hit Mama.

690
00:51:17,166 --> 00:51:19,291
You can never, ever do that.
Do you understand?

691
00:51:19,833 --> 00:51:20,833
-Can--
-Out!

692
00:51:21,333 --> 00:51:22,750
-No! No!
-Out!

693

-[Bianca] Get off me!
-[young Leda] Give me 15 more minutes.

694
00:51:30,083 --> 00:51:30,916
Down.

695
00:51:32,583 --> 00:51:33,541
I don't…

696
00:51:36,333 --> 00:51:40,500
I don't want to see you right now.

-Oh, yeah.

00:52:43,416 --> 00:52:46,500
-Fuck, you're good.
-Your cock is pushing me open.

707
00:53:02,375 --> 00:53:03,375
[man] Fuck.

Are you not hard? [clears throat]

709
00:53:06,875 --> 00:53:09,791
[panting] No, I… I am. I sort of am.

710
00:53:12,416 --> 00:53:13,416
Oh, baby.

711
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:15,666
It's okay.

712
00:53:16,833 --> 00:53:20,500
[breathing heavily] I'm sorry.
I'm just going to go to the bathroom.

713
00:53:22,708 --> 00:53:23,583
Yeah.

714
00:53:26,958 --> 00:53:28,666
When you get back,
I'm gonna make you come.

715
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:30,000
[young Leda] Mm-hmm.

716
00:53:38,916 --> 00:53:39,791
Nina!

717
00:53:44,375 --> 00:53:45,208

["Hello Bluebird" by Judy Garland playing]

719
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:00,416
Judy Garland was a fucking genius.

720
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,916
[Leda] Where the fuck
does Dr. Williams keep her coffee?

721
00:54:03,416 --> 00:54:05,041
Or does she just drink green tea?

722
00:54:05,125 --> 00:54:07,083
[man] Didn't you just have one
in Great Barrington?

723
00:54:07,166 --> 00:54:09,625
-[Leda] Fuck you.
-[man chuckles] Baby, have one of these.

724

00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:19,875
[Leda] Oh, my God, you're soaking wet!

729
00:54:19,958 --> 00:54:21,625
We saw sparrows and robins!

730
00:54:21,708 --> 00:54:24,750
Martha, this is Daddy's teacher's house.
Take your shoes off, now.

731
00:54:24,833 --> 00:54:28,333
Your shoes off. You've got to be
very, very careful in this house.

732
00:54:28,416 --> 00:54:30,833
-[Bianca] I'm hungry.
-Daddy's eaten your snack.

733
00:54:30,916 --> 00:54:33,833
[Bianca] Daddy, you said we'd
make Blitzes so the sun would come out.

734
00:54:33,916 --> 00:54:34,833
Why did you eat them?

735
00:54:34,916 --> 00:54:36,583
Baby, we will. I promise you.

736
00:54:36,666 --> 00:54:38,791
[Martha] What are you watching? Snoggies?

737
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:40,125

-[Martha] Hikers!
-Hikers. Stay there.

741
00:54:50,083 --> 00:54:51,833
They must be doing the Catamount Trail.

742
00:54:51,916 --> 00:54:53,375
[Bianca] Hey, what are hikers?

743
00:54:53,458 --> 00:54:54,833
[Leda] Are you kidding me?

744
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:57,833
-[Joe] To Quebec. They don't have food.
-Joe, it's not 1985.

745
00:54:57,916 --> 00:55:01,541
-[Joe] What's wrong with you? They're wet.
-Joe, don't bring them in here!

746
00:55:01,625 --> 00:55:03,875
[Joe] You guys, uh, look like
you've been going a while.

747
00:55:04,458 --> 00:55:06,250
[male hiker] Yes. Since April.

748
00:55:06,333 --> 00:55:07,416

-Grazie.

-[Joe] Can I ask how old you are?
-Forty-two.

[Joe laughing] Oh, my God.

752
00:55:14,083 --> 00:55:16,208
Life is so different without kids.

753
00:55:17,375 --> 00:55:18,625
[male hiker] I have kids.

754
00:55:19,208 --> 00:55:20,166
I have three kids.

755
00:55:21,375 --> 00:55:22,583
Twelve, nine and seven.

756
00:55:23,208 --> 00:55:25,250
They are in London, with their mother.

757
00:55:25,833 --> 00:55:27,500
So you ran away together?

[Leda and hiker chuckle]

759
00:55:30,666 --> 00:55:32,791
-[male hiker] I guess we did.
-Yes, we did.

760
00:55:33,958 --> 00:55:34,875
Hmm.

761
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:37,791
We are obliged
to do so many stupid things.

762
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:39,333
From childhood, even.

763
00:55:39,958 --> 00:55:41,708
-Obliged?
-[female hiker] Yes.

764
00:55:41,791 --> 00:55:44,625

is the only thing that's happened to me

765

It's almost 5:00.

835

This is so fresh,
you could even eat it raw.

836
01:00:23,291 --> 01:00:26,458
I think I would find that disgusting.
Or was that a dirty joke?

837
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:28,333
[laughs]

838
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:29,333
[Leda] Sorry.

839
01:00:30,416 --> 01:00:33,166
-How about fried?
-Uh, I don't know how to clean it.

840
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:35,833
I've cleaned it.
It'll just take two minutes.

841
01:00:35,916 --> 01:00:37,416
Oh. Okay.

842
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,333
[Lyle] I remember when I first got here,

843
01:00:39,416 --> 01:00:42,750
you could pick octopus
off the rocks with your hands.

844
01:00:42,833 --> 01:00:47,416
We used to hang them on the clotheslines,
like the old ladies do.

a time when you could have walked

on the backs of whales.

Uh, do you have a lemon?

852
01:01:06,166 --> 01:01:08,666
[Leda] Your kids must have loved it
with the octopus.

853
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:10,208
Sounds like a nice way to grow up.

854
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:12,750
They grew up with their mom, in Philly.

856
01:01:17,666 --> 01:01:19,333
[Leda] I don't think so. I'm old.

857
01:01:20,375 --> 01:01:24,541

At the most you're, what, forty?

Two grown-up children.

867
01:01:41,833 --> 01:01:43,541
Daughters. 25 and 23.

868
01:01:43,625 --> 01:01:45,625
Martha grew up worrying about me.

869
01:01:45,708 --> 01:01:49,041
Poor little thing. Checking that I ate,
didn't die at night, like a little mama.

870
01:01:49,125 --> 01:01:50,500
Bianca's like her father.

871
01:01:50,583 --> 01:01:52,833
She made me feel
like she wanted to remake me.

872
01:01:53,625 --> 01:01:55,750
Like her viciousness was for my own good.

873
01:01:55,833 --> 01:01:57,500
Well, my oldest is 50.

874
01:01:58,125 --> 01:01:59,291
Actually 51.

875
01:01:59,375 --> 01:02:01,375
-So, I win.
-[chuckles]

876
01:02:02,208 --> 01:02:04,333
-Three times a grandfather.
-Oh.

877
01:02:05,583 --> 01:02:08,333
They're so soft when they're young.
Their little bodies.

878
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,833

-No.

881
01:02:18,291 --> 01:02:21,416
You know, Leonard Cohen
used to come over here from Hydra.

882
01:02:21,958 --> 01:02:25,375
We'd write songs together.
They liked that, when I told them.

883
01:02:26,791 --> 01:02:30,000
Not real songs.
Just messing around. They liked that.

884
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:34,250
And you know those uni shells?

885
01:02:34,958 --> 01:02:36,916
No? Sea urchins, you know…

886
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,208
-Oh, yeah.
-Purple, beautiful shells.

887
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,666
I used to fill them with cotton balls

888
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:43,875
and send 'em out to Philly
for their birthdays.

889
01:02:44,666 --> 01:02:46,625
I'll look out for some for your girls.

890
01:02:48,166 --> 01:02:49,875
You sound like a real family man.

891
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:52,500
Yeah.

893
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:00,541
[hesitates] Yeah, I taught…

894
01:03:01,083 --> 01:03:02,833
I taught them all how to swim.

895
01:03:03,875 --> 01:03:05,250

906
01:03:38,083 --> 01:03:39,291
It means "mean."

"Cruel."

01:03:52,583 --> 01:03:54,166

910
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:57,916
It was a real party.

-Do you feel sick?
-No, I'm fine.

912

Why don't you lay down for a minute?

913

Now, now, it'll pass.

914
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:40,458
Nothing needs to pass, Lyle. I feel fine.

And she loves Cheetah.

you can give her Cheetah.

This is the paper I'm giving.

993
01:11:10,166 --> 01:11:12,750
I'm not sure it's persuasive.

994
01:11:13,583 --> 01:11:16,875
Camus posits
that the ontological emptiness

of the universe

996
01:11:18,916 --> 01:11:23,125
chafes against
the intrinsically human desire

997
01:11:23,208 --> 01:11:25,041
for metaphysical meaning.

998
01:11:25,666 --> 01:11:29,458
[clearing throat]
Consequently, it is jarring

Bourdieu…

1002
01:12:14,333 --> 01:12:17,666
Bourdieu's mistake is that he often forgot
the first part of his own name.

1003

[laughter]

1004
01:12:20,291 --> 01:12:23,125
I'm sorry, Walter.
Walter is sensitive. Where is he?

That's terrible.

1006
01:12:26,666 --> 01:12:28,541
But what I really want to consider,

1007
01:12:28,625 --> 01:12:31,250
and I promise
I'm gonna bring this back to Auden,

1008
01:12:31,333 --> 01:12:35,250
is that which is
not only ineffable [clicks tongue]

1009
01:12:35,333 --> 01:12:36,541
but unthought.

1010
01:12:38,125 --> 01:12:43,083
I've been really turned on
by Ricœur's recent thinking

1011
01:12:43,166 --> 01:12:45,625
on linguistic hospitality and…

1012
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:47,625
[laughing]

1013
01:12:48,708 --> 01:12:51,083
How about his name, Ricœur…

1014
01:12:51,791 --> 01:12:54,166
Gosh, I should really
lean into that second syllable,

1015
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:56,250
because, God, he comes from the heart.

1016
01:12:57,291 --> 01:12:58,583
Um…

[both breathing heavily]

1020
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:21,583
Oh, I'm reading the most astounding piece
on Auden's "The Crisis" by Leda Caruso,

1021
01:13:22,583 --> 01:13:25,333
and it seems to me
that she has anticipated

1022
01:13:25,416 --> 01:13:28,750
Ricœur's recent thinking
on linguistic hospitality.

1023
01:13:28,833 --> 01:13:29,708
For her…

1024
01:13:31,833 --> 01:13:37,916
hospitality comes
in holding one's attention,

1025
01:13:38,625 --> 01:13:39,750
even in crisis.

1026
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:42,708
As Simone Weil says,

1027
01:13:42,791 --> 01:13:48,041
"Attention is the rarest
and purest form of generosity."

1028
01:13:48,125 --> 01:13:51,250
[young Leda] Suddenly he was
just saying my name. And it was…

1029
01:13:51,833 --> 01:13:54,000
[chuckles] It was crazy.

1030
01:13:54,875 --> 01:13:58,666
He was… No, he was talking
about the Auden publication.

1031
01:13:59,375 --> 01:14:00,833
He was saying that, um…

1032
01:14:01,875 --> 01:14:06,500
He was saying that I had anticipated
Ricœur's work on translation and…

1033
01:14:06,583 --> 01:14:08,583
[both panting]

1034
01:14:09,375 --> 01:14:13,041
That, yeah. That I had anticipated
Ricœur's work on translation,

1035
01:14:13,125 --> 01:14:15,916
and it was just…
I mean, it was… [sputters]

1036
01:14:16,458 --> 01:14:17,833
…wild.

1037
01:14:18,916 --> 01:14:20,208
And Cole looked like

1038
01:14:20,291 --> 01:14:21,416
his eyes were going to…

1039
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:25,458
He turned around in slow motion.
He was absolutely raging.

1040
01:14:25,541 --> 01:14:29,416
Leda Caruso is inside
Auden's private mythology.

1041
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:35,291
Thank God, because whenever
one tries to suppress doubt,

1042
01:14:36,625 --> 01:14:37,875
there is tyranny.

1043
01:14:38,583 --> 01:14:40,583
[audience applauding]

1044
01:14:47,708 --> 01:14:49,000
She's got chicken pox?

1045
01:14:50,125 --> 01:14:54,041
That's crazy, she just had a little cold.
Does she have a fever?

1046
01:14:55,250 --> 01:14:56,125
Oh.

1047
01:14:56,208 --> 01:14:58,250
That's not really a fever.

1048
01:14:58,333 --> 01:14:59,375
No.

1049
01:14:59,458 --> 01:15:03,958
I haven't… I haven't even…
I haven't even read his recent work.

1050
01:15:04,791 --> 01:15:06,500
It was all my own thinking.

1051
01:15:09,458 --> 01:15:11,708
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Put her on the phone.

1052
01:15:16,916 --> 01:15:18,125
[knocking on door]

1053
01:15:18,208 --> 01:15:20,125
Hi, sweetheart.

1054
01:15:21,333 --> 01:15:24,208
[sighs] Hi. Is it itchy?

1055
01:15:24,291 --> 01:15:27,791
[clicks tongue] Aw, I know.
It's not very nice.

1056
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:30,291
Did Daddy give you a DVD?

1057
01:15:30,375 --> 01:15:32,250
[knocking on door]

1058
01:15:32,333 --> 01:15:35,708
Yeah, well, just don't forget
it gets a little bit scary when the…

1059
01:15:35,791 --> 01:15:38,333
Um, can you just hang on
one minute, sweetheart?

1060
01:15:38,416 --> 01:15:39,916
-Yeah. Coming. One--
-[knocking]

1061
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,041
[phone clatters]

1062
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:46,625
Oh.

1063
01:15:46,708 --> 01:15:49,291
-Sorry to disturb you.
-No, no, no. Not at all.

1064
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:52,375
I came by to congratulate you
on your success tonight.

1065
01:15:52,458 --> 01:15:53,708
Oh, thank you.

1066
01:15:53,791 --> 01:15:56,458
You'll have to get
the Yeats piece finished now.

1067
01:15:56,541 --> 01:15:59,166
-Another publication is important.
-Yeah. For sure.

1068
01:15:59,250 --> 01:16:02,041
Yes. I'll tell Hardy how we're working.

1069
01:16:03,208 --> 01:16:05,916
Dinner is in 20 minutes
in the dining room.

1070
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:08,875
I've arranged a seat for you.

1071
01:16:08,958 --> 01:16:11,750
[young Leda] Oh, my goodness.
Um… Thank you.

1072
01:16:30,916 --> 01:16:33,541
Hello. Sorry, I think this is my car.

1073
01:16:37,583 --> 01:16:40,708
-You think it's your car?
-Yeah. It's a rental.

1074
01:16:44,875 --> 01:16:45,958
Excuse us.

1075
01:16:48,125 --> 01:16:51,000
-Lyle tells me you're renting his place.
-Did he?

1076
01:16:51,083 --> 01:16:52,000
[Toni] Mmm.

1077
01:16:52,916 --> 01:16:55,625
I mean, teachers get to take
the whole summer off. That's nice.

1078
01:16:56,125 --> 01:16:57,916
Well, it's a working holiday.

1079
01:16:58,458 --> 01:17:00,458
[Toni chuckles]

1080
01:17:01,625 --> 01:17:02,625
I like it. Yeah.

1081
01:17:02,708 --> 01:17:03,708
Me too.

1082
01:17:05,541 --> 01:17:09,250
You know, thanks for helping
with Elena the other day.

1083
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:12,583
And with Nina. She can get spacey.

1084
01:17:13,791 --> 01:17:15,291
Sure. Excuse me.

1085
01:17:15,375 --> 01:17:16,583
[door handle thudding]

1086
01:17:17,666 --> 01:17:20,583
-Oh. Not my car. It's…
-No.

1087
01:17:21,875 --> 01:17:23,000
[Leda] Bye.

1088
01:17:28,291 --> 01:17:29,208
[Toni] Bye.

1089
01:17:32,125 --> 01:17:35,125
[indistinct conversations]

1090
01:17:53,583 --> 01:17:55,083
I didn't realize you were here.

1091
01:17:55,958 --> 01:17:59,625
-It's really great to meet you.
-It's great to meet you too.

1092
01:18:00,208 --> 01:18:02,166
Your work is thrilling.

1093
01:18:03,666 --> 01:18:04,666
Thank you.

1094
01:18:05,541 --> 01:18:06,666
Thrilling.

1095
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:10,458
Thank you.

1096
01:18:16,333 --> 01:18:17,791
[Cole chuckles]

1097
01:18:19,625 --> 01:18:21,083
[Cole sighing]

1098
01:18:23,083 --> 01:18:24,916
He is a serious scholar, but--

1099
01:18:25,958 --> 01:18:28,083
It's amazing to see. Amazing.

1100
01:18:28,166 --> 01:18:29,958
-What is?
-Well…

1101
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:36,000
It would be interesting to see his tactics
as he renews his pursuit this evening.

1102
01:18:49,375 --> 01:18:50,458
[Leda] Excuse me.

1103
01:19:01,625 --> 01:19:03,625
Where is the waiter?

1104
01:19:04,583 --> 01:19:06,208
Some Champagne, please.

1105
01:19:07,458 --> 01:19:09,916
-[laughing]
-[young Leda] Don't cry! No, no, no!

1106
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,708
I loved…
I loved the jokes about their names.

1107
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:17,416
-It made you seem more human.
-Human?

1108
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:20,583
-As opposed to what?
-As opposed to a god.

1109
01:19:21,958 --> 01:19:23,416
Ah. Mmm.

1110
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:27,708
Your name. Leda. It's very provocative.

1111
01:19:27,791 --> 01:19:30,458
[chuckles] You're thinking
about the Yeats.

1112
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:32,583
[clicks tongue]

1113
01:19:32,666 --> 01:19:35,625
Very high-minded.
It always brings rape to mind.

1114
01:19:35,708 --> 01:19:36,666
Jesus.

1115
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:39,166
I bet you know it by heart.

1116
01:19:41,208 --> 01:19:42,500
-In Italian.
-Ah.

1117
01:19:47,666 --> 01:19:49,583
"Tutto d'un colpo

1118
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:55,375
La grande ala…

1119
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,541
Palpitante…

1120
01:20:01,708 --> 01:20:03,750
Sulla ragazza…"

1121
01:20:04,250 --> 01:20:05,875
Uh, mm…

1122
01:20:05,958 --> 01:20:07,416
Staggering girl.

1123
01:20:08,791 --> 01:20:10,125
Sconcertante.

1124
01:20:10,208 --> 01:20:12,125
Si, ragazza.

1125
01:20:13,416 --> 01:20:16,083
Sconcertante.

1126
01:20:17,041 --> 01:20:17,958
Mmm.

1127
01:20:22,583 --> 01:20:24,708
[whispering] I want to go to bed with you.

1128
01:20:27,208 --> 01:20:30,333
But it looks like you're married, so…

1129
01:20:34,875 --> 01:20:36,541
you'll have to start this.

1130
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:11,625
[moans]

1131
01:21:34,958 --> 01:21:37,166
[girls chattering]

1132
01:21:42,291 --> 01:21:45,000
-[young Leda gasps] Hi!
-[girls scream happily]

1133
01:21:45,083 --> 01:21:46,291
Hello!

1134
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:49,583
[laughing]

1135
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:52,500
Hello, little hug monkeys.

1136
01:21:54,875 --> 01:21:57,458
[kissing]

1137
01:21:57,541 --> 01:21:58,958
I missed you.

1138
01:21:59,833 --> 01:22:01,125
-Did you miss me?
-Yeah.

1139
01:22:01,208 --> 01:22:02,708
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1140
01:22:17,041 --> 01:22:19,208
-[door closes in movie]
-[man] Hiya, fatso.

1141
01:22:19,291 --> 01:22:23,250
[woman] Fatso is right.
Look at me, bulging out of my own clothes.

1142
01:22:24,208 --> 01:22:26,291
[young men clamoring]

1143
01:22:33,625 --> 01:22:35,833
[chairs clattering]

1144
01:22:45,125 --> 01:22:46,791
[young man 1] I'd fuck that hole.

1145
01:22:46,875 --> 01:22:48,750
[young man 2] Nah, she's too old, yo.

1146
01:22:49,583 --> 01:22:53,208
[young man 1] I'd let her suck my cock
if I didn't have to look at her face.

1147
01:22:53,291 --> 01:22:55,750
-[shushing]
-[all laughing]

1148
01:23:01,416 --> 01:23:04,166
Excuse me, please,
we're trying to watch this film.

1149
01:23:08,375 --> 01:23:09,708
[young man 3] Okay.

1150
01:23:09,791 --> 01:23:13,291
Hey! If you can't control yourselves,
we're gonna have to call the usher.

1151
01:23:13,791 --> 01:23:16,125
The usher! The usher!
She's gonna call the usher, yo.

1152
01:23:16,791 --> 01:23:20,250
[young man 2] Yeah, bitch.
Call the usher! Call that cocksucker!

1153
01:23:21,708 --> 01:23:24,125
[young men chattering loudly]

1154
01:23:30,208 --> 01:23:31,208
Hello?

1155
01:23:35,708 --> 01:23:36,833
Hello?

1156
01:23:39,458 --> 01:23:40,708
Is anyone there?

1157
01:23:40,791 --> 01:23:43,791
-[pounding on door]
-[woman] Yes, yes, yes, yes. Hi.

1158
01:23:45,375 --> 01:23:48,291
Hi. There's a group of boys
being extremely disruptive in theater two.

1159
01:23:49,708 --> 01:23:52,208
-Disruptive?
-Throwing popcorn, shouting at the screen.

1160
01:23:52,291 --> 01:23:54,208
Shouting at other people. Disruptive.

1161
01:23:55,583 --> 01:23:57,250
[woman] Okay. Do you want your money back?

1162
01:23:57,333 --> 01:23:59,083
No. I want you to do something about it.

1163
01:23:59,166 --> 01:24:02,875
[woman] Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry. I can take care of it.

1164
01:24:02,958 --> 01:24:04,875
Just give me a minute here, okay?

1165
01:24:04,958 --> 01:24:06,208
-Thank you.
-[woman] Okay.

1166
01:24:07,833 --> 01:24:09,833
[young men laughing]

1167
01:24:17,208 --> 01:24:18,958
[man in movie] What happened to her hand?

1168
01:24:19,666 --> 01:24:20,625
Fuck you!

1169
01:24:25,083 --> 01:24:26,958
[young men become quiet]

1170
01:24:27,041 --> 01:24:30,916
[woman in movie] You better be beautiful.
A genius, and terribly rich.

1171
01:24:31,458 --> 01:24:35,208
[man] The beauty she got from my daughter.
The genius she inherited from me.

1172
01:24:35,291 --> 01:24:37,916
You better get busy
with your contribution, my boy.

1173
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:42,625
[woman] The last nine months
I devoted to you.

1174
01:24:42,708 --> 01:24:46,125
Now I'm gonna have fun.
What do you say, sweetheart?

1175
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:48,083
Whee!

1176
01:24:48,791 --> 01:24:50,791

01:24:59,375 --> 01:25:02,166
[movie dialogue continues indistinctly]

1179
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,166
No! I'm gonna cut
your tiny, little dicks off

1180
01:25:07,250 --> 01:25:09,000
and feed them to you like peanuts.

1181
01:25:09,958 --> 01:25:12,416
This is unacceptable!
I'm calling the police!

1182
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:14,625
Call the police, bitch. Call the police.

1183
01:25:14,708 --> 01:25:18,208
Blue Lives Matter! Blue Lives Matter!
Blue Lives Matter!

1184
01:25:18,291 --> 01:25:19,250
[Vassili] Enough!

1185
01:25:19,333 --> 01:25:21,291
[man 1 in movie]
Not much of a story, is it?

1186
01:25:21,375 --> 01:25:25,416
[man 2] You know how Americans in Paris
love to read about Americans in Paris.

1187
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:27,333
[man 1] All right. What's your name?

1188
01:25:27,416 --> 01:25:28,333
Fuck you!

1189
01:25:28,958 --> 01:25:30,208
[men in movie laughing]

1190
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:33,458
[man 2] That's my girl.

1191
01:25:33,541 --> 01:25:34,958
[men in movie continue laughing]

1192
01:25:50,791 --> 01:25:53,208
-[Bianca] Mama, do you have a snack?
-Mm-hmm.

1193
01:25:53,291 --> 01:25:54,541
Did you bring a snack?

1194
01:25:54,625 --> 01:25:56,500
Uh… Oh, shit.

1195
01:25:56,583 --> 01:25:59,958
Um, we'll get something later.
Why don't you go up there and play?

1196
01:26:00,041 --> 01:26:03,541
[Martha] Mama, the balloon man's here.

1197
01:26:03,625 --> 01:26:05,541
I want a whale one.

1198
01:26:06,166 --> 01:26:08,750
I know he can make whales.

1199
01:26:10,125 --> 01:26:12,458
[young Leda speaking Italian]

1200
01:26:12,541 --> 01:26:13,791
Il fulmine!

1201
01:26:15,166 --> 01:26:21,041
[reciting in Italian] La loro vera madre…
La loro vera madre era mia moglie.

1202
01:26:21,583 --> 01:26:23,000
[Hardy growling playfully]

1203
01:26:23,083 --> 01:26:25,250
E il loro vero padre era Zeus.

1204
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:29,458
Fucking brilliant.
You're so fucking brilliant.

1205
01:26:29,541 --> 01:26:30,625
[Martha] Mama.

1206
01:26:31,166 --> 01:26:32,250
Mmm.

1207
01:26:33,166 --> 01:26:35,375
[in Italian] I don't want
to  come in your mouth.

1208
01:26:35,875 --> 01:26:39,583
I want to wait until you're inside me.

1209
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:47,958
[in English] Well, maybe it's good for you
not to get exactly what you want.

1210
01:26:49,666 --> 01:26:53,541
Please, Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama. Please.

1211
01:26:57,125 --> 01:26:59,458
Oh, fuck, yeah.

1212
01:26:59,541 --> 01:27:04,166
[young Leda] Yes, baby. I'm gonna
get you sweets from London. Mm-hmm.

1213
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:05,083
What?

1214
01:27:06,583 --> 01:27:07,500
I can't…

1215
01:27:08,458 --> 01:27:10,416
Bia… I can't…

1216
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:14,208
Bianca, can you turn the phone around?
I can't… I can't hear Martha.

1217
01:27:14,833 --> 01:27:15,833
Hmm?

1218
01:27:16,416 --> 01:27:20,375
Aw! Okay, babies.
I can't wait to see you too. I love you.

1219
01:27:21,125 --> 01:27:23,791
No, you hang up first.
It's better that way.

1220
01:27:24,750 --> 01:27:29,041
Okay. Love you. Bye. Bye-bye. [kissing]

1221
01:27:29,708 --> 01:27:31,666
I love you. [chuckles]

1222
01:27:31,750 --> 01:27:32,833
Okay.

1223
01:27:32,916 --> 01:27:34,125
[clears throat]

1224
01:27:34,208 --> 01:27:35,416
[line disconnects]

1225
01:27:37,833 --> 01:27:39,791
I hate talking to my kids on the phone.

1226
01:27:40,708 --> 01:27:41,625
What?

1227
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,500
[whispers] I hate talking
to my kids on the phone.

1228
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:50,541
-They don't like it either.
-Don't say that.

1229
01:27:50,625 --> 01:27:51,583
They don't.

1230
01:27:53,291 --> 01:27:54,375
Don't say that.

1231
01:27:57,875 --> 01:27:58,708
[slaps]

1232
01:27:59,875 --> 01:28:00,833
Okay.

1233
01:28:08,375 --> 01:28:09,625
-[doorbell rings]
-[gasps]

1234
01:28:09,708 --> 01:28:11,708
[thunder rumbling]

1235
01:28:12,916 --> 01:28:15,333
[doorbell ringing]

1236
01:28:19,541 --> 01:28:20,458
Hello?

1237
01:28:24,583 --> 01:28:25,541
Hello?

1238
01:28:46,833 --> 01:28:48,916
[foghorn blaring]

1239
01:28:51,125 --> 01:28:52,000
Shit.

1240
01:28:55,250 --> 01:28:57,000
[cell phone ringtone playing]

1241
01:29:02,375 --> 01:29:03,250
Hello?

1242
01:29:04,166 --> 01:29:05,583
Yeah, this is she.

1243
01:29:08,166 --> 01:29:09,750
Oh, is everything okay?

1244
01:29:11,833 --> 01:29:17,041
Uh, yeah, I'm at the last store
by the boats. It sells vintage jewelry.

1245
01:29:18,375 --> 01:29:19,750
I won't move from here.

1246
01:29:28,958 --> 01:29:31,291
I've been following you
for, like, ten minutes.

1247
01:29:31,375 --> 01:29:34,458
-Yeah, you said, is everything okay?
-What? Yeah?

1248
01:29:37,666 --> 01:29:41,250
Your number came up on my phone yesterday.

1249
01:29:42,541 --> 01:29:45,333
-You called me?
-I did. Yeah.

1250
01:29:45,416 --> 01:29:46,416
[Elena] Lady.

1251
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:49,000
Hey, little one. Are you feeling better?

1252
01:29:49,083 --> 01:29:50,875
She needs her medicine.

1253
01:29:50,958 --> 01:29:53,208
-Your doll, is she sick?
-[Nina] She's not getting over it.

1254
01:29:54,375 --> 01:29:56,875
She wants her doll. Shit.

1255
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:02,208
-It won't stay on.
-Oh, hey.

1256
01:30:06,333 --> 01:30:07,166
Can I?

1257
01:30:08,750 --> 01:30:11,625
My grandma used to use hat pins.
It won't fall off now.

1258
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:14,750
Okay. Hat.

1259
01:30:17,666 --> 01:30:18,625
All right?

1260
01:30:20,541 --> 01:30:22,333
-Do it where it's comfy.
-[sighs]

1261
01:30:35,291 --> 01:30:38,125
[Nina] Since the doll went missing,
she's been, like, actually

1262
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:40,458
driving me fucking crazy.

1263
01:30:41,166 --> 01:30:42,125
I…

1264
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:45,333
There's something wrong with her.
She's not sleeping.

1265
01:30:46,250 --> 01:30:49,041
At all. She won't sleep
unless I'm in the bed with her.

1266
01:30:49,125 --> 01:30:50,666
And if I move…

1267
01:30:50,750 --> 01:30:53,750
I'm really tired. I'm, like, scary tired.

1268
01:30:53,833 --> 01:30:55,166
Mm, I remember.

1269
01:31:03,583 --> 01:31:05,291
I know you saw me with Will.

1270
01:31:07,416 --> 01:31:08,458
Um…

1271
01:31:10,958 --> 01:31:12,916
I don't want you to think badly of me.

1272
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:15,291
I don't think badly of anyone.

1273
01:31:16,416 --> 01:31:17,333
Yeah.

1274
01:31:18,208 --> 01:31:21,250
Yeah, uh, see, I knew that.
As soon as I saw you, I just…

1275
01:31:22,083 --> 01:31:24,791
-I was like, "I wanna be like that lady."
-[chuckles]

1276
01:31:28,208 --> 01:31:30,416
[Nina] It didn't mean anything,
what you saw.

1277
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:31,750
[Leda] Didn't it?

1278
01:31:32,541 --> 01:31:34,166
[Nina scoffing] No.

1279
01:31:35,208 --> 01:31:38,291
I don't let it go anywhere. I just…

1280
01:31:40,666 --> 01:31:42,041
But I'm happy.

1281
01:31:42,875 --> 01:31:45,666
I'm happy with Elena,
with-- with everything.

1282
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:46,666
I'm…

1283
01:31:49,333 --> 01:31:50,666
I met my husband so young.

1284
01:31:52,375 --> 01:31:54,458
And he's fucking crazy about me.

1285
01:31:55,208 --> 01:31:56,333
And her.

1286
01:31:57,333 --> 01:32:00,458
He says my breasts
are exactly the size of his hand.

1287
01:32:02,416 --> 01:32:04,333
[Leda] What would he do
if he saw you with Will?

1288
01:32:04,833 --> 01:32:06,708
Oh, he'd cut my throat.

1289
01:32:07,458 --> 01:32:08,833
I don't want to talk about him.

1290
01:32:08,916 --> 01:32:12,125
I only have, like, five minutes
before Callie finishes shopping.

1291
01:32:12,208 --> 01:32:13,583
She doesn't want you to talk to me?

1292
01:32:13,666 --> 01:32:15,666
She doesn't want me
to do fucking anything.

1293
01:32:15,750 --> 01:32:17,000
Who gives a fuck?

1294
01:32:22,666 --> 01:32:24,041
Can I ask you something?

1295
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:25,958
[Leda] Sure.

1296
01:32:28,708 --> 01:32:30,375
What happened in the toy store?

1297
01:32:35,416 --> 01:32:37,708
You were talking
about your daughters and then

1298
01:32:39,208 --> 01:32:40,666
something happened.

1299
01:32:42,250 --> 01:32:43,875
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1300
01:32:44,750 --> 01:32:45,708
Yeah.

1301
01:32:52,125 --> 01:32:53,458
I left.

1302
01:32:57,375 --> 01:32:58,250
Oh.

1303
01:33:00,541 --> 01:33:03,708
When the oldest was seven
and the youngest was five, I left.

1304
01:33:03,791 --> 01:33:04,958
[sobbing softly]

1305
01:33:06,750 --> 01:33:09,291
I abandoned them
and I didn't see them for three years.

1306
01:33:09,375 --> 01:33:11,916
You didn't see your children
for three years?

1307
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:12,958
No.

1308
01:33:17,083 --> 01:33:18,541
Who took care of them?

1309
01:33:19,416 --> 01:33:22,333
Their father and my mum,
and then I came back for them.

1310
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:28,666
What did it feel like without them?

1311
01:33:30,625 --> 01:33:32,125
[sobbing]

1312
01:33:32,750 --> 01:33:33,625
[sniffs]

1313
01:33:34,708 --> 01:33:36,125
It felt amazing.

1314
01:33:40,375 --> 01:33:43,541
Felt like I'd been trying not to explode
and then I exploded.

1315
01:33:49,083 --> 01:33:50,541
That doesn't sound amazing.

1316
01:33:51,541 --> 01:33:52,541
Okay.

1317
01:33:58,750 --> 01:34:01,625
-There's Callie and your husband.
-My husband?

1318
01:34:03,583 --> 01:34:04,833
What the fuck is he doing here?

1319
01:34:04,916 --> 01:34:07,083
He's not supposed to be here
until tomorrow.

1320
01:34:08,666 --> 01:34:10,375
Fuck. I have to go.

1321
01:34:19,583 --> 01:34:21,041
[indistinct conversation]

1322
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,083
[grunts]

1323
01:34:43,375 --> 01:34:44,833
[door opening]

1324
01:34:46,291 --> 01:34:49,166
[young Leda gasps] Hi, guys.

1325
01:34:52,250 --> 01:34:53,833
-Hey.
-Hi.

1326
01:34:53,916 --> 01:34:55,416
-Hmm.
-[kisses]

1327
01:34:57,166 --> 01:35:01,083
[Joe chuckling] What are you doing?
Say hello to Mummy.

1328
01:35:01,166 --> 01:35:04,250
Martha. Go on. Go say hello.

1329
01:35:04,791 --> 01:35:06,500
["I Told Jesus" by Roberta Flack playing]

1330
01:35:06,583 --> 01:35:07,625
It's okay.

1331
01:35:10,250 --> 01:35:12,500
-[Leda] Can I get a hug?
-[Joe] Go on.

1332
01:35:13,125 --> 01:35:14,500
-[exclaims]
-Oh!

1333
01:35:14,583 --> 01:35:16,208
[chuckles]

1334
01:35:17,291 --> 01:35:18,541
Mmm.

1335
01:35:19,166 --> 01:35:21,166
Are you home now, Mummy?

1336
01:35:21,250 --> 01:35:22,500
I'm home today.

1337
01:35:23,208 --> 01:35:26,958
Can you wash my hair after dinner?

1338
01:35:27,041 --> 01:35:32,666
Mm-mmm. I can't stay for dinner, baby.
I've got to get on an airplane.

1339
01:35:32,750 --> 01:35:34,041
Oh, okay.

1340
01:35:34,125 --> 01:35:35,250
[chuckles]

1341
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:39,583
But I brought you presents. Hmm?

1342
01:35:40,416 --> 01:35:42,166
And fancy dresses.

1343
01:35:47,083 --> 01:35:48,125
These.

1344
01:35:49,291 --> 01:35:50,166
Hi.

1345
01:35:52,791 --> 01:35:54,125
Yours!

1346
01:36:00,875 --> 01:36:05,375
You awoke the tickle monster.
There's a tickle monster in town.

1347
01:36:05,458 --> 01:36:10,458
Bianca? Do you want me to help you
do your buttons up in the back?

1348
01:36:10,541 --> 01:36:11,625
[Bianca] No.

1349
01:36:12,125 --> 01:36:13,125
[young Leda] Okay.

1350
01:36:15,250 --> 01:36:16,541
Show me your dress.

1351
01:36:17,041 --> 01:36:19,708
Oh! So pretty.

1352
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:21,500
Mwah.

1353
01:36:21,583 --> 01:36:23,291
[both laughing]

1354
01:36:24,916 --> 01:36:27,583
-Leda, can I talk to you?
-Sure.

1355
01:36:34,791 --> 01:36:37,958
[crying] Please. Please don't this.

1356
01:36:38,041 --> 01:36:41,541
Come on, what do you fucking need?
Do need me on my knees?

1357
01:36:41,625 --> 01:36:44,708
Do you need me to cut my balls off?
What do you need? Tell me.

1358
01:36:46,291 --> 01:36:48,833
Have you got his cock in your mouth,
you can't answer me?

1359
01:36:48,916 --> 01:36:50,708
Joe, this has nothing to do with that.

1360
01:36:50,791 --> 01:36:52,500
Oh, fuck me? Fuck me?

1361
01:36:52,583 --> 01:36:54,000
-I left him.
-You left him?

1362
01:36:54,083 --> 01:36:56,250
Congratulations, baby,
you're an expert. Huh?

1363
01:36:56,833 --> 01:36:58,958
Do you think I'm a fucking idiot? Huh?

1364
01:36:59,666 --> 01:37:00,875
Am I an arsehole?

1365
01:37:01,541 --> 01:37:04,583
Please. Please. Please. Please. Come on.

1366
01:37:06,166 --> 01:37:09,666
They're little fucking girls.
How am I supposed to do this?

1367
01:37:10,916 --> 01:37:12,750
Joe, I'm feeling dizzy.

1368
01:37:15,958 --> 01:37:18,250
I'm taking them to your mum's.
I can't handle this.

1369
01:37:18,333 --> 01:37:20,166
-No, you're not.
-Yeah. [sniffles]

1370
01:37:21,291 --> 01:37:22,458
You're threatening me?

1371
01:37:23,958 --> 01:37:25,458
That is revenge.

1372
01:37:26,625 --> 01:37:29,000
That's fuck… Lazy.

1373
01:37:29,083 --> 01:37:32,750
You bring them back there, and they're
going to sink into that black shithole.

1374
01:37:32,833 --> 01:37:37,250
All the fucking shit… that I came from.

1375
01:37:38,583 --> 01:37:40,041
I do think you're an arsehole.

1376
01:37:40,125 --> 01:37:41,666
My mother didn't even finish school.

1377
01:37:41,750 --> 01:37:43,083
[Joe] Oh, fucking so what?

1378
01:37:47,833 --> 01:37:49,083
[young Leda] Mm-hmm.

1379
01:37:52,083 --> 01:37:53,916
[objects clattering]

1380
01:37:58,125 --> 01:37:59,583
