1
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:06,073
What the fuck is that?

2
00:01:06,783 --> 00:01:07,949
Jimmy?

3
00:01:08,242 --> 00:01:09,993
- What's up?
- Did I hit something?

4
00:01:10,161 --> 00:01:11,828
What the fuck is that?

5
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:14,498
Maybe you got a flat?

6
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,626
No.

7
00:01:19,253 --> 00:01:21,213
What the fuck?
You better pull over and see.

8
00:01:48,366 --> 00:01:50,617
He's still alive. You
fucking piece of shit!

9
00:01:50,785 --> 00:01:53,620
Die, you motherfucker! Look at me!

10
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:07,050
As far back as I can remember,
I always wanted to be a gangster.

11
00:02:47,008 --> 00:02:48,049
To me...

12
00:02:48,217 --> 00:02:52,637
being a gangster was better than
being president of the United States.

13
00:02:55,766 --> 00:02:59,311
Even before I first wandered into the
cabstand for an after-school job...

14
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,563
I knew I wanted to be a part of them.

15
00:03:01,731 --> 00:03:04,149
It was there that I knew I belonged.

16
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:08,820
To me, it meant being somebody
in a neighborhood full of nobodies.

17
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:12,073
They weren't like anybody else.
They did whatever they wanted.

18
00:03:12,241 --> 00:03:15,827
They double-parked in front of a hydrant,
nobody ever gave them a ticket.

19
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:18,330
In the summer,
when they played cards all night...

20
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,624
nobody ever called the cops.

21
00:03:32,637 --> 00:03:34,679
Tony Stacks. How are you?

22
00:03:35,973 --> 00:03:37,432
Tuddy Cicero.

23
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,893
Could this be the Canarsie Kid?

24
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,062
- How are you?
- Good.

25
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:44,523
Tuddy.

26
00:03:45,441 --> 00:03:48,485
Tuddy ran the cabstand
and the Bella Vista Pizzeria...

27
00:03:48,653 --> 00:03:53,281
and other places for his brother, Paul,
who was the boss of the neighborhood.

28
00:03:57,912 --> 00:04:00,205
Paulie might have moved slow...

29
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:06,628
but it was only because Paulie
didn't have to move for anybody.

30
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,926
- It's your fault.
- You started it.

31
00:04:13,094 --> 00:04:15,136
I started it? It's your fault.

32
00:04:15,304 --> 00:04:19,724
At first my parents loved that I found
a job across the street from the house.

33
00:04:20,851 --> 00:04:24,604
My father, who was lrish,
was sent to work at the age of 11.

34
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:26,690
He liked that I got myself a job.

35
00:04:26,857 --> 00:04:30,402
He always used to say
that American kids were spoiled lazy.

36
00:04:32,196 --> 00:04:33,822
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

37
00:04:34,323 --> 00:04:35,615
See you, Mikey.

38
00:04:35,783 --> 00:04:36,992
Bye, Henry.

39
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:39,160
Henry! Watch how you cross!

40
00:04:39,328 --> 00:04:40,745
Bring back milk!

41
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:44,040
My mother was happy after
she found out that the Ciceros...

42
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:47,752
came from the same part of Sicily
as she did. To my mother...

43
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,714
that was the answer to all her prayers.

44
00:04:52,174 --> 00:04:54,634
I was the luckiest kid in the world.

45
00:04:54,802 --> 00:04:57,637
I could go anywhere, I could do anything.

46
00:04:57,805 --> 00:05:00,473
I knew everybody,
and everybody knew me.

47
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:03,685
Wiseguys would pull up
and Tuddy would toss me their keys...

48
00:05:03,853 --> 00:05:05,604
and let me park their Cadillacs.

49
00:05:05,771 --> 00:05:09,357
Here I am, this little kid,
I can't even see over the steering wheel...

50
00:05:09,525 --> 00:05:11,693
and I'm parking Cadillacs.

51
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:17,032
But it wasn't too long...

52
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,036
before my parents changed
their minds about my job at the cabstand.

53
00:05:21,203 --> 00:05:22,829
For your mother and sister.

54
00:05:22,997 --> 00:05:26,374
For them, the cabstand was supposed
to be a part-time job. But for me...

55
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:28,501
it was definitely full-time.

56
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:30,587
That's all I wanted to do.

57
00:05:30,755 --> 00:05:34,924
People like my father could never
understand, but I was a part of something.

58
00:05:35,092 --> 00:05:37,886
I belonged. I was treated like a grown-up.

59
00:05:38,721 --> 00:05:40,221
Tell him 519.

60
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,390
Every day I was learning to score.

61
00:05:42,558 --> 00:05:45,060
A dollar here, a dollar there.

62
00:05:45,227 --> 00:05:47,145
I was living in a fantasy.

63
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:51,232
Have a good day at school?

64
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,193
My father was always pissed off.

65
00:05:53,361 --> 00:05:55,487
Pissed that he made such lousy money...

66
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:58,573
pissed that my kid brother Michael
was in a wheelchair.

67
00:05:58,741 --> 00:06:02,994
He was pissed that there were seven of us
living in such a tiny house.

68
00:06:03,412 --> 00:06:05,121
Tell me about this.

69
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:07,582
It's a letter from school.

70
00:06:08,084 --> 00:06:10,919
It says you haven't been there in months.

71
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:13,505
In months!

72
00:06:15,257 --> 00:06:16,758
You're a bum!

73
00:06:16,926 --> 00:06:19,052
Want to grow up to be a bum?

74
00:06:20,596 --> 00:06:24,766
After a while, he was mostly pissed
because I hung around the cabstand.

75
00:06:24,934 --> 00:06:26,810
He knew what went on at that cabstand.

76
00:06:26,977 --> 00:06:31,606
Every once in a while, I'd have to take
a beating. But by then, I didn't care.

77
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:33,650
The way I saw it...

78
00:06:33,984 --> 00:06:36,611
everybody takes a beating sometime.

79
00:06:37,822 --> 00:06:41,574
- I can't make any more deliveries.
- What? You'll fuck everything up.

80
00:06:41,742 --> 00:06:43,785
My dad says he'll kill me. Look.

81
00:06:43,953 --> 00:06:45,412
Come on with me.

82
00:06:45,663 --> 00:06:47,580
- Is that him, kid?
- No.

83
00:06:48,249 --> 00:06:49,958
- How about him?
- No.

84
00:06:51,961 --> 00:06:54,003
- That's the guy.
- Get him.

85
00:06:55,798 --> 00:06:57,132
Excuse me.

86
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,969
- Scumbag.
- Come here, you piece of shit.

87
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:10,895
- Know this kid?
- Yeah.

88
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:12,647
- Know where he lives?
- Yeah.

89
00:07:12,815 --> 00:07:15,024
- You deliver mail to his house?
- Yeah.

90
00:07:15,192 --> 00:07:18,987
From now on, any letter from that school
to his house comes directly here.

91
00:07:19,155 --> 00:07:20,238
- Understand?
- Yeah.

92
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:23,116
Another letter from that school
goes to that kid's house...

93
00:07:23,284 --> 00:07:25,785
in the fucking oven you'll go, head first.

94
00:07:25,953 --> 00:07:30,248
That was it. No more letters from
truant officers. No letters from school.

95
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,500
In fact, no more letters from anybody.

96
00:07:32,668 --> 00:07:36,463
Finally after a few weeks, my mother
went to the post office to complain.

97
00:07:37,006 --> 00:07:38,465
How could I go to school after that...

98
00:07:38,632 --> 00:07:42,761
and pledge allegiance to the flag
and sit through good government bullshit?

99
00:07:45,848 --> 00:07:49,017
Paulie hated phones.
He wouldn't have one in his house.

100
00:07:49,185 --> 00:07:51,853
Mickey called. Want me to call him back?

101
00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:53,855
All right, make the call.

102
00:07:54,023 --> 00:07:57,609
He got all his calls second hand.
Then you'd have to call the people back...

103
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:58,818
from an outside phone.

104
00:07:58,986 --> 00:08:01,446
Got a nickel? Get him on the phone.

105
00:08:02,198 --> 00:08:06,951
There were guys, that's all they did
all day, was take care of Paulie's calls.

106
00:08:16,587 --> 00:08:20,882
For a guy who moved all day long,
Paulie didn't talk to six people.

107
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:24,052
If there was a union problem
or, say, a beef in the numbers...

108
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,722
only the top guys could meet
with Paulie to discuss the problem.

109
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:31,142
Everything was one-on-one.
Paulie hated conferences.

110
00:08:31,894 --> 00:08:34,354
He didn't want anybody
hearing what he said...

111
00:08:34,522 --> 00:08:37,816
and he didn't want anybody listening
to what he was being told.

112
00:08:37,983 --> 00:08:42,237
Hundreds of guys depended on Paulie,
he got a piece of everything they made.

113
00:08:42,404 --> 00:08:46,741
It was a tribute, like in the old country,
except they were doing it in America.

114
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:51,371
All they got from Paulie was protection
from other guys looking to rip them off.

115
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:55,458
That's what it's all about. That's what
the FBI could never understand.

116
00:08:55,918 --> 00:08:58,086
What Paulie and the Organization does...

117
00:08:58,254 --> 00:09:02,173
is offer protection for people
who can't go to the cops. That's it.

118
00:09:02,758 --> 00:09:06,886
That's all it is. They're like
the police department for wiseguys.

119
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:20,775
People looked at me differently,
and they knew I was with somebody.

120
00:09:20,943 --> 00:09:25,280
I didn't have to wait in line at the bakery
on Sunday mornings for fresh bread.

121
00:09:25,447 --> 00:09:26,823
The owner knew who I was with...

122
00:09:26,991 --> 00:09:30,368
and he'd come from around the counter.
No matter how many were waiting...

123
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:32,537
I was taken care of first.

124
00:09:32,788 --> 00:09:35,123
Our neighbors didn't park
in our driveway anymore...

125
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,917
even though we didn't have a car. At 13...

126
00:09:38,085 --> 00:09:40,962
I was making more money than most
of the grown-ups around.

127
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:44,257
I had more money than I could spend.
I had it all.

128
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:59,063
One day, some neighborhood kids carried
my mother's groceries all the way home.

129
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:00,648
You know why?

130
00:10:01,483 --> 00:10:03,318
It was out of respect.

131
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,155
Hi, Mom, what do you think?

132
00:10:08,782 --> 00:10:11,492
- Look at my shoes, aren't they great?
- My God.

133
00:10:12,036 --> 00:10:13,620
You look like a gangster.

134
00:10:13,787 --> 00:10:15,496
They shot me. Help!

135
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,918
Henry, shut the door.

136
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,213
That was the first time
I had ever seen anyone shot.

137
00:10:25,007 --> 00:10:27,175
Can't have that in here. Jesus Christ!

138
00:10:27,343 --> 00:10:29,260
I can't have that in this joint.

139
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:31,137
I remember feeling bad about the guy...

140
00:10:31,305 --> 00:10:34,474
but I also remember feeling
that maybe Tuddy was right.

141
00:10:34,725 --> 00:10:37,352
I knew Paulie didn't want
anybody dying in the building.

142
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,356
You're a real jerk. You wasted
eight fucking aprons on this guy.

143
00:10:41,523 --> 00:10:44,776
What the hell's wrong with you?
I got to toughen this kid up.

144
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,381
It was a glorious time.

145
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:09,884
And wiseguys were all over the place.

146
00:11:10,844 --> 00:11:13,805
It was before Apalachin
and before Crazy Joe...

147
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:16,891
decided to take on a boss and start a war.

148
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:19,602
It was when I met the world.

149
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,480
And it was when I first met
Jimmy Conway.

150
00:11:23,732 --> 00:11:27,110
He couldn't have been more than 28 or 29
at the time...

151
00:11:27,277 --> 00:11:29,195
but he was already a legend.

152
00:11:29,363 --> 00:11:33,366
He'd walk in the door and everybody
who worked the room just went wild.

153
00:11:33,534 --> 00:11:36,119
He'd give the doorman $100
just for opening the door.

154
00:11:36,286 --> 00:11:40,206
He'd give hundreds to the dealers
and the guys who ran the games.

155
00:11:40,374 --> 00:11:43,334
The bartender got $100
just for keeping the ice cubes cold.

156
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:46,587
The Irishman is here
to take all you guineas' money.

157
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,552
- Want a drink?
- Give me a 7 and 7.

158
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:03,062
- I'd like you to meet the kid Henry.
- How you doing?

159
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:08,151
- Thank you.
- Keep them coming.

160
00:12:08,318 --> 00:12:11,320
Jimmy was one of the most
feared guys in the city.

161
00:12:11,488 --> 00:12:13,114
He was first locked up at 11...

162
00:12:13,282 --> 00:12:16,367
and he was doing hits
for mob bosses when he was 16.

163
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:19,328
See, hits never bothered Jimmy.
It was business.

164
00:12:19,788 --> 00:12:21,873
But what Jimmy really loved to do...

165
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,042
what he really loved to do was steal.

166
00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:26,419
He actually enjoyed it.

167
00:12:26,587 --> 00:12:30,506
Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted
for the bad guys in the movies.

168
00:12:31,216 --> 00:12:32,967
Give me your wallet.

169
00:12:35,971 --> 00:12:39,098
You might know who we are,
but we know who you are. Understand?

170
00:12:39,266 --> 00:12:41,684
He was one of
the city's biggest hijackers...

171
00:12:41,852 --> 00:12:45,438
of booze, cigarettes, razor blades,
shrimp and lobsters.

172
00:12:45,606 --> 00:12:48,524
Shrimp and lobsters were best.
They went really fast.

173
00:12:48,692 --> 00:12:52,570
Almost all of them were gimmies.
They just gave it up, no problem.

174
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:54,405
They called him Jimmy the Gent.

175
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:55,698
Help the lady.

176
00:12:55,866 --> 00:12:57,909
Drivers loved him.
They used to tip him off...

177
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:01,662
about the really good loads.
Of course, everybody got a piece.

178
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,915
Thanks, I'll be back for the rest later.

179
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,500
Okay, see you later.

180
00:13:08,045 --> 00:13:09,670
Henry, come here.

181
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:12,632
- Say hello to Tommy.
- How're you doing, Henry?

182
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,801
You're gonna be working together, okay?

183
00:13:14,968 --> 00:13:16,677
Help him. Go ahead.

184
00:13:17,054 --> 00:13:19,180
Jimmy, you got anything good?

185
00:13:19,348 --> 00:13:23,559
And when the cops assigned a whole
army to stop Jimmy, what did he do?

186
00:13:23,727 --> 00:13:24,727
How're you doing?

187
00:13:24,895 --> 00:13:26,646
He made them partners.

188
00:13:26,814 --> 00:13:28,523
I'd complain, but who'd listen?

189
00:13:29,024 --> 00:13:30,358
- One Pall Mall.
- There you go.

190
00:13:30,526 --> 00:13:32,652
- What do you need?
- Two Luckies.

191
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,779
- Here you go, Henry.
- Thanks a lot.

192
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:35,863
What do you need?

193
00:13:36,031 --> 00:13:38,699
- One Pall Mall.
- One Pall Mall, here you go.

194
00:13:38,867 --> 00:13:40,535
- What are you doing?
- It's all right.

195
00:13:40,702 --> 00:13:43,704
- You have permission from your mother?
- How many cartons you need?

196
00:13:43,872 --> 00:13:46,916
- Where'd you get the cigarettes?
- Get him out of here.

197
00:13:47,084 --> 00:13:48,835
- It's okay.
- It's not okay.

198
00:13:49,002 --> 00:13:52,255
- You don't understand.
- You don't understand. Store's closed.

199
00:13:57,094 --> 00:13:58,928
- Henry got pinched.
- Where?

200
00:13:59,096 --> 00:14:00,888
By the factory, selling cigarettes.

201
00:14:01,056 --> 00:14:04,892
Henry Hill. The People of
the State of New York vs. Henry Hill.

202
00:14:05,185 --> 00:14:07,979
Docket number 704162.

203
00:14:09,565 --> 00:14:11,357
Yes, sir. That's me.

204
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,904
Just stand there. Now stay there.

205
00:14:23,328 --> 00:14:25,079
Counselor, proceed.

206
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,709
Congratulations.

207
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,919
Here's your graduation present.

208
00:14:32,087 --> 00:14:35,047
- What for? I got pinched.
- Everyone does, but you did it right.

209
00:14:35,215 --> 00:14:37,258
You told them nothing,
and they got nothing.

210
00:14:37,426 --> 00:14:40,595
- I thought you'd be mad.
- I'm not mad, I'm proud of you.

211
00:14:40,762 --> 00:14:45,057
You took your first pinch like a man and
learned the two greatest things in life.

212
00:14:45,225 --> 00:14:47,560
- What?
- Look at me.

213
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,396
Never rat on your friends...

214
00:14:50,564 --> 00:14:52,899
and always keep your mouth shut.

215
00:14:55,986 --> 00:14:57,361
Here he is.

216
00:14:57,905 --> 00:14:59,780
You broke your cherry.

217
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,456
Congratulations!

218
00:15:43,158 --> 00:15:46,410
By the time I grew up,
there was $30 billion a year in cargo...

219
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:48,329
moving through ldlewild Airport...

220
00:15:48,497 --> 00:15:51,582
and believe me,
we tried to steal every bit of it.

221
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,502
See, you gotta understand,
we grew up near the airport.

222
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,170
It belonged to Paulie.

223
00:15:56,338 --> 00:15:59,006
We had friends and relatives
who worked all over the place.

224
00:15:59,174 --> 00:16:03,010
They would tip us off about
what was coming in and moving out.

225
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:06,264
If any truckers or airlines
gave us trouble...

226
00:16:06,431 --> 00:16:10,518
Paulie had the union people scare them
with a strike. It was beautiful.

227
00:16:10,686 --> 00:16:14,480
It was a bigger moneymaker than numbers
and Jimmy was in charge of it all.

228
00:16:14,648 --> 00:16:17,441
Whenever we needed money,
we'd rob the airport.

229
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:20,069
To us, it was better than Citibank.

230
00:16:31,164 --> 00:16:33,541
You got a phone? Come on!

231
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:37,461
Two niggers just stole my truck.
Can you believe that shit?

232
00:16:42,384 --> 00:16:44,135
There was Jimmy...

233
00:16:44,428 --> 00:16:45,928
and Tommy and me.

234
00:16:46,096 --> 00:16:47,930
And there was Anthony Stabile.

235
00:16:48,098 --> 00:16:49,640
How're you doing?

236
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:51,392
Frankie Carbone.

237
00:16:53,437 --> 00:16:56,564
And then there was Mo Black's brother,
Fat Andy.

238
00:16:57,607 --> 00:16:59,650
And his guys, Frankie the Wop.

239
00:17:01,611 --> 00:17:03,487
Freddy No Nose.

240
00:17:04,948 --> 00:17:08,951
And then there was Pete the Killer,
who was Sally Balls' brother.

241
00:17:11,121 --> 00:17:13,247
Then you had Nickey Eyes...

242
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,250
and Mikey Franzese.

243
00:17:16,418 --> 00:17:17,835
That guy, I wanna see him.

244
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:21,630
Jimmy Two Times, who got that nickname
because he said everything twice.

245
00:17:21,798 --> 00:17:24,300
I'm gonna go get the papers,
get the papers.

246
00:17:36,438 --> 00:17:40,232
What is this? Coats?
Henry, I need suits, not coats.

247
00:17:40,734 --> 00:17:42,193
Suits are coming Thursday.

248
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:45,279
But it's the middle of summer.
What'll I do with fur coats?

249
00:17:45,447 --> 00:17:47,573
You don't want furs? I'll take them away.

250
00:17:47,741 --> 00:17:52,119
No, I want them. We'll hang them
in the freezer with the meat. How's that?

251
00:17:52,287 --> 00:17:54,955
For us, to live any other way was nuts.

252
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:59,377
To us, those goody-good people who
worked shitty jobs for bum paychecks...

253
00:17:59,544 --> 00:18:03,464
and took the subway to work every day
and worried about bills, were dead.

254
00:18:03,965 --> 00:18:06,550
They were suckers. They had no balls.

255
00:18:06,927 --> 00:18:09,220
If we wanted something, we just took it.

256
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:13,849
If anyone complained twice, they got hit
so bad they never complained again.

257
00:18:14,017 --> 00:18:17,520
It was just all routine.
You didn't even think about it.

258
00:18:20,315 --> 00:18:23,150
Frankie, what the fuck does 520
have to do with 469?

259
00:18:23,318 --> 00:18:24,693
I can't believe this guy.

260
00:18:24,861 --> 00:18:28,823
520 ain't even close to 469.
What's that got to do with anything?

261
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:33,828
Piece of cake. It's all there.

262
00:18:33,995 --> 00:18:37,289
Don't worry about the alarms.
I just gotta find a way to get the key.

263
00:18:37,457 --> 00:18:39,917
- No problem, right?
- I'll take care of it.

264
00:18:47,342 --> 00:18:50,886
- Tell him what you were telling me.
- Too good to be true.

265
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:55,558
Big score coming from Air France.
Bags of money coming in.

266
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:59,228
Tourists and American servicemen
change their money...

267
00:18:59,396 --> 00:19:01,355
into French money and send it back here.

268
00:19:01,523 --> 00:19:03,566
- Calm down.
- It's beautiful.

269
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:07,236
It's totally untraceable. Okay?

270
00:19:07,404 --> 00:19:10,072
The only problem is getting a key,
but I've got a plan.

271
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,617
- Me and Frenchy and this citizen.
- Yeah, he's a piece of work.

272
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:17,663
If I'm right, there could be
$500,000 coming in, all cash.

273
00:19:18,707 --> 00:19:22,501
The best time is probably over a weekend.
So maybe Saturday night.

274
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:24,670
There's a Jewish holiday on Monday.

275
00:19:24,838 --> 00:19:27,173
They won't find out until Tuesday.
Beautiful.

276
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,175
What about the security?

277
00:19:29,342 --> 00:19:30,551
Security?

278
00:19:30,886 --> 00:19:33,971
You're looking at it. It's a joke.
I'm the midnight-to-eight man.

279
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:35,598
I'm the commandant.

280
00:19:35,765 --> 00:19:38,559
He just comes in
like he's picking up lost baggage.

281
00:19:38,727 --> 00:19:41,270
- It's beautiful.
- It won't be a problem at all.

282
00:19:41,438 --> 00:19:43,022
- Good.
- We're on.

283
00:19:44,191 --> 00:19:47,651
What's really funny is
that fucking bank job in Secaucus.

284
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:49,904
I'm in the middle of the weeds,
lying down.

285
00:19:50,071 --> 00:19:52,281
He says, "What are you doing?"
I said, "I'm resting."

286
00:19:52,449 --> 00:19:55,743
"Here? This ain't no beach or park."
I said, "I'm resting."

287
00:19:55,911 --> 00:19:57,369
I know I'm resting.

288
00:19:57,537 --> 00:20:00,831
He pulls me in, starts asking questions.
You know, this and that.

289
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:03,918
"What are you going to tell us?"
I said, "My usual. Nothing."

290
00:20:04,085 --> 00:20:08,464
"Why tell you?" The fuck. He says,
"No, you'll tell me something today."

291
00:20:08,757 --> 00:20:11,091
I said, "Okay, go fuck your mother."

292
00:20:15,263 --> 00:20:18,724
You saw the paper, Anthony.
My head was out like this.

293
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:22,895
Now I'm coming around,
and who do I see in front of me?

294
00:20:23,063 --> 00:20:26,732
This prick again. He says,
"What do you want to tell me now?"

295
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,861
I said, "What are you doing here?
I told you to go fuck your mother."

296
00:20:31,821 --> 00:20:33,989
I thought he was gonna shit.

297
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:39,119
The fuckers. I wish I was big just once.

298
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,459
Funny. You're really funny.

299
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,629
What do you mean, I'm funny?

300
00:20:48,797 --> 00:20:52,049
It's funny, you know. It's a good story.

301
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:53,926
You're a funny guy.

302
00:20:54,928 --> 00:20:57,137
You mean the way I talk? What?

303
00:20:57,973 --> 00:21:00,683
It's just, you know. You're just funny.

304
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:04,144
You know, the way
you tell the story and everything.

305
00:21:04,312 --> 00:21:06,647
Funny how? What's funny about it?

306
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:10,150
- Tommy, you got it all wrong.
- Anthony.

307
00:21:10,318 --> 00:21:12,820
He's a big boy. He knows what he said.
What did you say?

308
00:21:12,988 --> 00:21:14,280
Funny, how?

309
00:21:16,783 --> 00:21:18,993
Just, you know. You're funny.

310
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:21,328
Let me understand this.

311
00:21:21,538 --> 00:21:23,539
Maybe I'm a little fucked up.

312
00:21:23,707 --> 00:21:27,042
But, I'm funny, how? Funny like a clown?
I amuse you?

313
00:21:27,836 --> 00:21:30,379
I make you laugh?
I'm here to fucking amuse you?

314
00:21:30,547 --> 00:21:33,215
What do you mean, funny?
How am I funny?

315
00:21:36,678 --> 00:21:39,013
You know, how you tell a story.

316
00:21:39,222 --> 00:21:43,017
No, I don't know. You said it.
How do I know? You said I'm funny.

317
00:21:43,184 --> 00:21:46,604
How the fuck am I funny?
What the fuck is so funny about me?

318
00:21:46,771 --> 00:21:48,522
Tell me what's funny.

319
00:21:54,195 --> 00:21:56,071
Get the fuck out of here, Tommy.

320
00:21:56,239 --> 00:21:59,366
Motherfucker! I almost had him!

321
00:22:00,535 --> 00:22:02,494
You stuttering prick, you!

322
00:22:02,662 --> 00:22:04,580
Frankie, was he shaking?

323
00:22:05,665 --> 00:22:09,460
I wonder about you sometimes, Henry.
You may fold under questioning.

324
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:15,132
Jesus Christ.

325
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,927
What the fuck is it with you?
I thought I was getting pinched already.

326
00:22:19,095 --> 00:22:22,431
He's hanging on my fucking neck
like a vulture. What do you want?

327
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:25,851
This guy didn't want to come
and give you the check.

328
00:22:26,394 --> 00:22:27,936
Could you take care of this?

329
00:22:28,104 --> 00:22:30,898
No problem. Tell him to put it
on my tab. Of course.

330
00:22:31,066 --> 00:22:32,983
That's what I want to talk to you about.

331
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:36,570
It ain't just this one.
It's seven big ones you owe me.

332
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:40,574
$7,000, that ain't peanuts.
I don't mean to be out of order...

333
00:22:40,742 --> 00:22:42,743
Don't mean to be out of order?

334
00:22:42,911 --> 00:22:45,037
It's good you don't mean
to be out of order.

335
00:22:45,205 --> 00:22:48,916
Embarrassing me in front of my friends,
like I'm a deadbeat.

336
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,918
You know, Sonny, you're a fucking mutt.

337
00:22:51,086 --> 00:22:53,087
You know the money
we spend in this fucking...

338
00:22:53,254 --> 00:22:55,506
- Don't be like that.
- What do you mean?

339
00:23:02,138 --> 00:23:05,432
Do you believe this prick?
You think this is funny?

340
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:12,106
What the fuck are you looking at?
You fucking moron!

341
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,858
You don't want to bring the check?

342
00:23:16,486 --> 00:23:18,529
Do you believe this prick?

343
00:23:21,408 --> 00:23:24,118
You're supposed
to be doing this stuff, too.

344
00:23:24,285 --> 00:23:25,953
You're a funny guy.

345
00:23:26,871 --> 00:23:28,997
- That's it, Henry.
- No, go back.

346
00:23:30,834 --> 00:23:34,837
You want to laugh? This prick last week
asked me to christen his kid.

347
00:23:35,463 --> 00:23:37,756
I charged him $7,000.

348
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:42,803
You really are a funny guy.

349
00:23:46,808 --> 00:23:49,601
I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds
of fucking bad things.

350
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:51,937
He's treating me like I'm a fucking fag.

351
00:23:52,105 --> 00:23:55,649
I got to go on the lam
in order to get away from this guy.

352
00:23:55,817 --> 00:23:58,819
This ain't right. I can't go here,
I can't go there.

353
00:23:58,987 --> 00:24:02,322
You think you're the only one?
I talk to them, they don't listen.

354
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:06,410
If you tell him, he'll stop.
I'll wind up being declared an MIA.

355
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:09,663
They'll find me in the back of a car
somewhere in the weeds.

356
00:24:09,831 --> 00:24:12,291
You've known this Tommy all your life.
Who knows better?

357
00:24:12,459 --> 00:24:13,959
This cocksucker's an arch criminal.

358
00:24:14,127 --> 00:24:17,755
When I leave my house, before I get
to the car I look over both shoulders.

359
00:24:17,922 --> 00:24:20,340
This is no way to live.
I'm no fence jumper.

360
00:24:20,508 --> 00:24:22,843
I'm around you all my life,
tell me what I gotta do.

361
00:24:23,011 --> 00:24:25,804
- Whatever I got to do, I'm gonna do.
- What could I do?

362
00:24:25,972 --> 00:24:30,058
If there was something I could do, I would.
I would like to help you out.

363
00:24:30,393 --> 00:24:32,895
Sonny, tell him what we talked about.

364
00:24:33,229 --> 00:24:35,272
- You think it's all right?
- Yeah.

365
00:24:37,942 --> 00:24:41,695
Maybe you could come in with me,
take a piece of this joint. It'd be good.

366
00:24:41,863 --> 00:24:44,823
What are you talking about?
You mean the restaurant?

367
00:24:44,991 --> 00:24:47,701
It's a classy place. Look at the layout.

368
00:24:47,869 --> 00:24:50,954
You've been in there a million times.
You know how it looks.

369
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:54,875
Tommy taking over this joint
is like putting a silk hat on a pig.

370
00:24:55,043 --> 00:24:58,045
I don't mean no disrespect,
but that's the way it is.

371
00:24:58,213 --> 00:25:01,632
I know you're his friend.
I'm begging you. What can I say?

372
00:25:02,342 --> 00:25:05,260
What am I gonna do?
What do you want from me?

373
00:25:05,595 --> 00:25:09,223
I don't know anything
about the restaurant business. Nothing.

374
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:12,810
All I know is to sit down and order a meal,
not how to make a restaurant.

375
00:25:12,977 --> 00:25:15,229
Not for you. It's just a place to hang.

376
00:25:15,396 --> 00:25:19,066
The chef is great. The shows are good.
There's a lot of whores coming in.

377
00:25:19,234 --> 00:25:22,236
I'd love to help you, but what do you want
from me? What'll I do?

378
00:25:22,403 --> 00:25:25,656
Tommy's a bad kid, a bad seed.
What am I supposed to do? Shoot him?

379
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:27,783
That wouldn't be a bad idea.

380
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:37,209
I'm sorry I said that. I didn't mean it.
I just mean that he's scaring me.

381
00:25:37,418 --> 00:25:39,878
I just need help. Help me, please.

382
00:25:40,713 --> 00:25:43,090
You know anything about
this restaurant business?

383
00:25:43,258 --> 00:25:46,093
He knows everything.
He's there 24 hours a day.

384
00:25:46,261 --> 00:25:48,929
Another fucking few minutes,
he could be a stool.

385
00:25:49,097 --> 00:25:50,639
That's how often he's in there.

386
00:25:50,807 --> 00:25:54,560
You want me to be your partner?
Is that what you're telling me?

387
00:25:54,727 --> 00:25:58,188
What the fuck you think I'm talking about?
Paulie, please. Come on.

388
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:00,357
It's not even fair.

389
00:26:00,608 --> 00:26:02,109
You don't understand.

390
00:26:02,277 --> 00:26:05,737
You run the joint.
Maybe I'll try to help you, all right.

391
00:26:05,905 --> 00:26:09,992
God bless you, Paulie. I appreciate it.
You've always been fair with me.

392
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,037
Now the guy's got Paulie as a partner.
Any problems, he goes to Paulie.

393
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:16,290
Trouble with a bill, he can go to Paulie.

394
00:26:16,457 --> 00:26:18,625
Trouble with the cops,
deliveries, Tommy...

395
00:26:18,793 --> 00:26:20,085
he can call Paulie.

396
00:26:20,253 --> 00:26:23,046
Now the guy's gotta come up
with Paulie's money every week...

397
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:24,298
no matter what.

398
00:26:24,465 --> 00:26:28,510
"Business is bad? Fuck you, pay me.
Had a fire? Fuck you, pay me.

399
00:26:28,678 --> 00:26:31,471
"The place got hit by lightning?
Fuck you, pay me."

400
00:26:31,639 --> 00:26:33,807
Can I get one of those TVs?

401
00:26:33,975 --> 00:26:35,642
Also, Paulie could do anything.

402
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:38,854
Especially run up bills on the
joint's credit. And why not?

403
00:26:39,022 --> 00:26:40,981
Nobody's gonna pay for it anyway.

404
00:26:41,149 --> 00:26:43,150
When deliveries are made
at the front door...

405
00:26:43,318 --> 00:26:45,986
you move the stuff out the back
and sell it at a discount.

406
00:26:46,154 --> 00:26:49,448
You take a $200 case of booze
and sell it for $100.

407
00:26:49,657 --> 00:26:52,159
It doesn't matter. It's all profit.

408
00:26:53,995 --> 00:26:56,496
Then finally, when there's nothing left...

409
00:26:56,664 --> 00:26:57,623
Fucking shame.

410
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:01,960
...when you can't borrow another buck
or buy another case of booze...

411
00:27:02,128 --> 00:27:04,838
you bust the joint out. You light a match.

412
00:27:05,006 --> 00:27:06,506
Do you need help reaching anything?

413
00:27:06,674 --> 00:27:09,009
You look like
you're decorating a Christmas tree.

414
00:27:09,177 --> 00:27:11,386
You don't know what you're doing.

415
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,183
She's from the Five Towns.

416
00:27:16,851 --> 00:27:17,935
Who?

417
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:21,563
The Jew broad, Diane,
I was telling you I'm going to shag.

418
00:27:22,357 --> 00:27:24,942
I've been trying to bang her
for a fucking month now.

419
00:27:25,151 --> 00:27:27,402
She won't go out with me alone.

420
00:27:28,029 --> 00:27:29,613
- No.
- No, what?

421
00:27:30,573 --> 00:27:32,866
No, what? Who the fuck
asked you anything?

422
00:27:33,034 --> 00:27:34,993
I didn't ask you.
Hear what I'm going to say.

423
00:27:35,161 --> 00:27:36,703
All right, what?

424
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:38,497
Okay, what.

425
00:27:38,706 --> 00:27:41,333
She don't want to go out
with Italians alone.

426
00:27:41,501 --> 00:27:43,710
She's prejudiced against Italians.

427
00:27:43,878 --> 00:27:46,046
You fucking believe that?
In this day and age?

428
00:27:46,214 --> 00:27:48,924
What the fuck is this world coming to?

429
00:27:50,051 --> 00:27:53,929
I can't believe this. A Jew broad,
prejudiced against Italians.

430
00:27:54,097 --> 00:27:57,224
She won't go out with me alone
unless her girlfriend comes with us.

431
00:27:57,392 --> 00:27:59,393
So you come along,
go out with her girlfriend.

432
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,395
See? I knew it.

433
00:28:01,562 --> 00:28:03,897
You knew what?
What the fuck is wrong with that?

434
00:28:04,065 --> 00:28:06,066
- When is this?
- Tomorrow night.

435
00:28:06,234 --> 00:28:07,734
I can't, I gotta meet Tuddy.

436
00:28:07,902 --> 00:28:10,654
You could meet Tuddy.
You can come early and then still go.

437
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:13,156
- Why do you always do this?
- Don't give me that shit.

438
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:15,784
What did I ask you for?
I'm asking you for a favor.

439
00:28:15,952 --> 00:28:17,744
I do a lot of fucking favors for you.

440
00:28:17,912 --> 00:28:20,789
I'm trying to bang this fucking broad.
Help me out.

441
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:25,043
I don't understand you. She's beautiful!

442
00:28:25,211 --> 00:28:28,255
Her fucking family lives in the Five Towns.
These Jews got money.

443
00:28:28,423 --> 00:28:32,801
Maybe the family owns the whole block.
You may wind up with a big score.

444
00:28:33,886 --> 00:28:36,013
You with your fucking mouth.

445
00:28:40,435 --> 00:28:44,855
I had a meeting with Tuddy at 11:00,
and here I am, a backup guy for Tommy.

446
00:28:45,273 --> 00:28:47,607
How about it?
Did you have enough to eat?

447
00:28:47,775 --> 00:28:50,277
It was delicious. I'm
just watching my diet.

448
00:28:50,445 --> 00:28:51,778
Let me watch your figure.

449
00:28:51,946 --> 00:28:53,488
I couldn't wait to get away.

450
00:28:53,656 --> 00:28:56,241
I was ordering the dessert
when they were eating dinner.

451
00:28:56,409 --> 00:28:58,869
When they were having coffee,
I was asking for a check.

452
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:00,245
I had business.

453
00:29:00,413 --> 00:29:02,914
Have some coffee. It'll wake you up.

454
00:29:05,209 --> 00:29:07,169
- Can we have the check?
- What are you doing?

455
00:29:07,336 --> 00:29:09,463
- I got to go.
- We just got here.

456
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,631
I got that thing. I gotta go.

457
00:29:11,841 --> 00:29:13,967
Wait a couple of minutes.
We'll leave together.

458
00:29:14,135 --> 00:29:17,929
This way we don't go out
like a bunch of hobos, one at a time.

459
00:29:18,514 --> 00:29:20,307
I couldn't stand him.

460
00:29:20,641 --> 00:29:22,809
I thought he was really obnoxious.

461
00:29:22,977 --> 00:29:25,020
He kept fidgeting around.

462
00:29:26,022 --> 00:29:28,982
You don't mind, do you?
That's very annoying.

463
00:29:31,486 --> 00:29:35,739
Good? You might prefer Manischewitz,
but it'd look funny on my table.

464
00:29:38,659 --> 00:29:40,035
- Ready?
- Henry, lighten up.

465
00:29:40,203 --> 00:29:42,454
We just got here. What are you doing?

466
00:29:43,498 --> 00:29:46,833
Before it was time to go home,
he was pushing me into the car...

467
00:29:47,001 --> 00:29:50,337
then pulling me out. It was ridiculous.

468
00:29:51,005 --> 00:29:53,173
Diane and Tommy made us promise...

469
00:29:53,341 --> 00:29:55,217
to meet them again on Friday night.

470
00:29:55,384 --> 00:29:56,551
We agreed.

471
00:29:56,719 --> 00:30:00,388
Of course, when Friday night came around,
Henry stood me up.

472
00:30:00,556 --> 00:30:03,350
I feel terrible. I don't know where he is.

473
00:30:03,976 --> 00:30:06,895
He really liked you, too.
All he did was talk about her.

474
00:30:07,063 --> 00:30:09,523
We were a trio
instead of a double date that night.

475
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:12,526
He would have called.
I hope it's nothing serious.

476
00:30:12,693 --> 00:30:15,403
But I made Tommy take me
looking for him.

477
00:30:19,867 --> 00:30:21,535
Tommy, what the fuck?

478
00:30:21,702 --> 00:30:24,496
You got some nerve standing me up.

479
00:30:24,664 --> 00:30:26,039
Nobody does that to me.

480
00:30:26,207 --> 00:30:29,876
Who do you think you are,
Frankie Valli or some kind of big shot?

481
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,922
Slow down, I forgot.
I thought it was next week.

482
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:37,384
It was this Friday and you agreed,
so you're a liar!

483
00:30:38,386 --> 00:30:40,303
We can talk about this. Take it easy.

484
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:41,888
Talk about it?

485
00:30:42,056 --> 00:30:44,724
Talk to you after what
you just did to me? Forget it.

486
00:30:45,852 --> 00:30:49,354
I thought you would stand me up.
You looked bored. You didn't say anything.

487
00:30:49,522 --> 00:30:50,814
What do you expect?

488
00:30:52,775 --> 00:30:54,776
Let me make it up to you.

489
00:30:55,069 --> 00:30:56,236
I'll think about it.

490
00:30:56,404 --> 00:30:59,948
I remember, she was screaming
on the street, and I mean loud.

491
00:31:00,116 --> 00:31:01,366
But she looked good.

492
00:31:01,534 --> 00:31:04,744
I'll think about it.
But it'll cost you, Hill. A lot.

493
00:31:04,912 --> 00:31:07,539
She had these great eyes
just like Liz Taylor's.

494
00:31:07,707 --> 00:31:09,749
At least that's what I thought.

495
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,294
Hello, Henry.

496
00:31:12,461 --> 00:31:13,795
- You're ready?
- Yeah.

497
00:31:13,963 --> 00:31:14,921
Come on.

498
00:31:15,089 --> 00:31:16,882
- No, wait a minute.
- What?

499
00:31:17,091 --> 00:31:19,926
Quick, you have to cover that cross.
My mother sees that...

500
00:31:20,094 --> 00:31:21,303
Karen.

501
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:22,929
Mom.

502
00:31:23,139 --> 00:31:25,932
- I'd like you to meet my friend, Henry Hill.
- How do you do?

503
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,603
- Nice to meet you.
- My daughter says that you're half Jewish.

504
00:31:30,605 --> 00:31:32,606
It's just the good half.

505
00:31:33,316 --> 00:31:35,358
- Thank you, sir.
- Bye, see you later, thanks.

506
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:37,777
What're you doing?
You're leaving your car?

507
00:31:37,945 --> 00:31:39,613
He watches the car for me.

508
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:42,449
It's easier than leaving it at a garage
and waiting.

509
00:31:42,658 --> 00:31:45,493
It's a lot quicker that way,
you know what I mean?

510
00:31:52,335 --> 00:31:56,046
I like going in this way.
It's better than waiting in line.

511
00:32:00,509 --> 00:32:04,137
How are you doing? What's up?
Here you go.

512
00:32:10,394 --> 00:32:12,395
- How are you doing?
- I'm doing all right.

513
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:13,730
Good.

514
00:32:17,151 --> 00:32:21,738
Every time I come here,
every time, you two. Don't you work?

515
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:14,874
Henry, nice to see you. Hi, how are you?

516
00:33:15,042 --> 00:33:17,085
Anthony, right in the front.

517
00:33:17,253 --> 00:33:19,546
Anything you need, just let me know.

518
00:33:37,898 --> 00:33:40,483
Tony, thanks a lot. I appreciate it.

519
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:42,861
- How are you guys doing?
- How are you?

520
00:33:48,576 --> 00:33:51,119
- You gave them $20 each.
- It's all right.

521
00:33:51,287 --> 00:33:53,705
Henry, this is with Mr. Tony, over there.

522
00:33:53,873 --> 00:33:55,165
- Where?
- Over there.

523
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:57,292
Thanks a lot, Tony.

524
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:02,922
- What do you do?
- What?

525
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:05,675
- What do you do?
- I'm in construction.

526
00:34:07,595 --> 00:34:09,971
They don't feel like
you're in construction.

527
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:11,931
I'm a union delegate.

528
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:14,851
Now, ladies and gentlemen...

529
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:19,606
the Copacabana is proud to present
the king of one-liners...

530
00:34:19,774 --> 00:34:21,733
Henny Youngman.

531
00:34:27,823 --> 00:34:31,618
How are you all? I'm glad to be here.
Take my wife, please.

532
00:34:33,746 --> 00:34:36,206
I take my wife everywhere
but she finds her way home.

533
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:41,127
I said, "Where do you wanna go
for our anniversary?"

534
00:34:41,295 --> 00:34:43,171
She said,
"Somewhere I've never been before."

535
00:34:43,339 --> 00:34:45,632
I said, "Try the kitchen."

536
00:34:46,801 --> 00:34:47,926
Dr. Wellsler is here.

537
00:34:48,094 --> 00:34:51,137
Gave a guy six months to live.
Couldn't pay his bill.

538
00:34:51,305 --> 00:34:53,390
Gave him another six months.

539
00:34:55,351 --> 00:34:57,268
I love this crowd.

540
00:35:11,659 --> 00:35:13,618
Air France made me.

541
00:35:13,786 --> 00:35:17,539
We walked out with $420,000
without using a gun.

542
00:35:17,706 --> 00:35:21,292
And we did the right thing.
We gave Paulie his tribute.

543
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,507
$60,000.

544
00:35:27,675 --> 00:35:29,843
It's going to be a good summer.

545
00:35:32,888 --> 00:35:36,558
I'm proud of you.
That is a lot of money for a kid like you.

546
00:35:36,725 --> 00:35:40,687
Anybody asks you where you got it, you got
it in Vegas playing craps, all right?

547
00:35:40,855 --> 00:35:42,188
All right.

548
00:35:43,858 --> 00:35:45,233
Check, sir.

549
00:35:47,361 --> 00:35:50,196
No. You have to sign for it here.

550
00:35:51,866 --> 00:35:53,533
Should I tip him?

551
00:36:01,709 --> 00:36:04,169
- How are you doing?
- Okay. How are you?

552
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:08,339
Henry, this is Bruce. Bruce, this is Henry.

553
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:11,050
Good to meet you.

554
00:36:11,927 --> 00:36:14,012
I'll see you around later.

555
00:36:18,726 --> 00:36:20,602
- Do you know him?
- Yeah.

556
00:36:20,769 --> 00:36:22,562
He lives across the street.

557
00:36:47,922 --> 00:36:52,467
One night, Bobby Vinton sent us
champagne. There was nothing like it.

558
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,596
I didn't think there was
anything strange in any of this.

559
00:36:56,764 --> 00:36:59,724
A 21 - year-old kid with such connections.

560
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:03,937
He was an exciting guy.

561
00:37:04,563 --> 00:37:08,566
He was really nice.
He introduced me to everybody.

562
00:37:09,151 --> 00:37:11,653
Everybody wanted to be nice to him.

563
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:14,364
He knew how to handle it.

564
00:37:22,623 --> 00:37:24,666
Don't buy wigs that come off
at the wrong time.

565
00:37:24,833 --> 00:37:27,085
Morrie's wigs don't come off!

566
00:37:27,253 --> 00:37:28,545
Even underwater.

567
00:37:28,712 --> 00:37:33,341
And remember, Morrie's wigs
are tested against hurricane winds.

568
00:37:33,509 --> 00:37:37,220
Forget about money. You can afford
a Morrie wig. Priced to fit every budget.

569
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:38,805
Call me now!

570
00:37:39,974 --> 00:37:42,559
Come in for a personalized fitting.

571
00:37:46,522 --> 00:37:49,482
Come on, Morrie. Jimmy's waiting.
You're past due.

572
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:52,110
You're a good kid.
We've been good to each other.

573
00:37:52,278 --> 00:37:54,696
But there's something
unreasonable going on here.

574
00:37:54,863 --> 00:37:57,115
Jimmy's being a ball-breaker.

575
00:37:57,283 --> 00:37:59,200
Give him 8-to-5 on Cleveland.

576
00:37:59,368 --> 00:38:02,954
I never had to pay the vigorish
he demands. Am I something special?

577
00:38:03,122 --> 00:38:04,789
What am I, a schmuck on wheels?

578
00:38:04,957 --> 00:38:07,375
You know Jimmy.
You borrowed his money. Pay him.

579
00:38:07,543 --> 00:38:09,752
I didn't agree to three points
above the vig.

580
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,422
What are you going to do?
Fight with Jimmy Conway?

581
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,882
He wants his money.
Give him his money and we'll go.

582
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:16,009
Fuck him!

583
00:38:16,176 --> 00:38:19,554
Fuck him in the ear!
Fuck him in the other ear!

584
00:38:19,722 --> 00:38:21,472
Did I ever bust his balls? Did I?

585
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,309
I could've dropped a dime a million times.

586
00:38:24,476 --> 00:38:27,645
You're talking crazy.
Stop it now, will you?

587
00:38:27,813 --> 00:38:31,024
You got money
for that fucking commercial.

588
00:38:31,191 --> 00:38:33,526
You don't got my money?

589
00:38:33,694 --> 00:38:35,570
Jimmy, he's gonna pay you.

590
00:38:35,738 --> 00:38:39,198
I'll fucking kill you.
Give me the money, cocksucker.

591
00:38:39,366 --> 00:38:40,992
Pay me my money.

592
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,744
He'll pay.

593
00:38:43,412 --> 00:38:46,623
Morrie's. Who's this? He's here.

594
00:38:47,583 --> 00:38:49,667
- Jimmy, I'm sorry.
- You should be sorry.

595
00:38:49,835 --> 00:38:53,046
Don't do it again.
Give me the fucking money!

596
00:38:53,213 --> 00:38:56,174
You hear me? Give me the fucking money.

597
00:38:56,342 --> 00:38:59,969
I'll give you. You've got it, kid.
You've got it, believe me.

598
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:02,263
Karen, slow down.

599
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:05,600
Where? Stay there. Don't move.

600
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,853
- What happened?
- It's Karen, Jimmy.

601
00:39:09,021 --> 00:39:11,439
- Money today.
- I'll pay.

602
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,576
What happened?

603
00:39:24,244 --> 00:39:25,912
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

604
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,538
Who did it?

605
00:39:27,706 --> 00:39:32,085
This guy who lives across the street
from me that I've known all my life.

606
00:39:37,257 --> 00:39:40,176
He started to touch me.
He started to grab me.

607
00:39:40,427 --> 00:39:43,012
I told him to stop. He didn't stop.

608
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:47,016
I hit him back.
And then he got really angry.

609
00:39:49,228 --> 00:39:51,354
He pushed me out of the car.

610
00:39:59,113 --> 00:40:01,114
You sure you're all right?

611
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:07,870
Why don't you go inside
and get yourself together. Clean up.

612
00:40:28,767 --> 00:40:31,394
What do you want, fucko?
You want something?

613
00:40:38,026 --> 00:40:42,113
I swear on my fucking mother,
if you touch her again, you're dead.

614
00:40:43,907 --> 00:40:45,241
Don't shoot.

615
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:08,389
- Hide this. Are you all right?
- Yeah.

616
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:15,354
I know there are women,
like my best friends...

617
00:41:15,522 --> 00:41:18,191
who would have gotten out
the minute their boyfriend...

618
00:41:18,358 --> 00:41:21,235
gave them a gun to hide. But I didn't.

619
00:41:22,154 --> 00:41:25,072
I've got to admit the truth.
It turned me on.

620
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,830
Mazel tov!

621
00:42:05,364 --> 00:42:09,325
Why don't you be like your friend Henry?
He's got a nice girl.

622
00:42:09,576 --> 00:42:12,620
He's settling down now. He's married.

623
00:42:12,788 --> 00:42:15,081
Pretty soon he'll have a nice family.

624
00:42:15,249 --> 00:42:18,876
And you're still bouncing around
from girl to girl.

625
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,095
It was like he had two families.

626
00:42:29,304 --> 00:42:33,558
The first time I was introduced
to all of them at once, it was crazy.

627
00:42:33,767 --> 00:42:37,144
Paulie and his brothers had lots
of sons and nephews.

628
00:42:37,563 --> 00:42:40,439
Almost all of them
were named Peter or Paul.

629
00:42:41,942 --> 00:42:43,442
It was unbelievable.

630
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:46,946
Meet Paulie Jr., my nephew.
And this is Petey.

631
00:42:47,281 --> 00:42:50,283
There must have been two dozen
Peters and Pauls at the wedding.

632
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:51,534
This is Marie.

633
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:54,537
Plus, they were all married
to girls named Marie.

634
00:42:54,913 --> 00:42:57,665
- She looks Italian.
- She is Italian, you're right.

635
00:42:57,833 --> 00:43:00,585
And they named all their daughters Marie.

636
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:05,172
And this is Pete. No, I mean Paulie.
I get confused myself.

637
00:43:05,507 --> 00:43:09,427
By the time I finished meeting everybody,
I thought I was drunk.

638
00:43:14,266 --> 00:43:16,058
Paulie, you shouldn't have.

639
00:43:19,146 --> 00:43:20,813
Welcome to the family.

640
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:22,315
Sunday dinner?

641
00:43:22,482 --> 00:43:25,151
So beautiful. I want to cry.

642
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:28,571
Here's something to help you get started.

643
00:43:45,339 --> 00:43:48,925
- The bag. The bag.
- What? What bag?

644
00:43:49,092 --> 00:43:52,011
The bag with the envelopes in it,
all the money.

645
00:43:53,013 --> 00:43:56,349
Don't worry about that.
Nobody's going to steal that here.

646
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,339
He didn't call?

647
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:32,385
- He's with his friends.
- What kind of person doesn't call?

648
00:44:32,552 --> 00:44:35,721
He's a grown-up. He doesn't have to call
every five minutes.

649
00:44:35,889 --> 00:44:39,350
If he was such a grown-up
why doesn't he get you two an apartment?

650
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:42,979
Don't start. Mom, you're the one
who wanted us here.

651
00:44:43,146 --> 00:44:46,691
You're here a month and sometimes
I know he doesn't come home at all.

652
00:44:46,858 --> 00:44:48,693
What kind of people are these?

653
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:51,696
- What do you want me to do?
- Do? What can you do?

654
00:44:51,863 --> 00:44:54,657
He's not Jewish.
Did you know how these people live?

655
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:56,409
Did you know what they were like?

656
00:44:56,576 --> 00:44:59,578
Your father never stayed out all night
without calling.

657
00:44:59,746 --> 00:45:03,040
Stay out? Daddy never
went out at all, Ma! Keep out of it.

658
00:45:03,208 --> 00:45:05,251
You don't know how I feel!

659
00:45:05,419 --> 00:45:09,255
How do you feel now? You don't know
where he is or who he's with.

660
00:45:09,423 --> 00:45:11,924
He's with his friends! Dad!

661
00:45:12,092 --> 00:45:14,093
Leave him out of this.
He's suffered enough.

662
00:45:14,261 --> 00:45:17,221
He hasn't digested a decent meal
in six weeks.

663
00:45:27,899 --> 00:45:30,067
Where were you? Why didn't you call?

664
00:45:30,235 --> 00:45:34,905
We were worried to death.
A married man does not stay out like this.

665
00:45:36,908 --> 00:45:39,535
Normal people don't act like this!

666
00:45:40,996 --> 00:45:42,788
What's wrong with you?

667
00:45:43,206 --> 00:45:47,043
You're not normal. She's right.
What's wrong with you?

668
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:50,379
What kind of person are you?
What is the matter with you?

669
00:45:50,964 --> 00:45:53,174
What kind of people are they?

670
00:45:55,927 --> 00:45:58,554
We weren't married to nine-to-five guys.

671
00:45:58,722 --> 00:46:01,474
But the first time I
realized how different...

672
00:46:01,641 --> 00:46:04,018
was when Mickey had a hostess party.

673
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:07,354
- Karen, where you from?
- Lawrence.

674
00:46:07,522 --> 00:46:11,817
On the Island. It's nice.
I'm from Miami. You ever been there?

675
00:46:12,235 --> 00:46:15,654
It's okay, but it's like you died
and woke up in Jew heaven.

676
00:46:16,198 --> 00:46:18,574
Angie, stop picking at that thing.

677
00:46:18,742 --> 00:46:20,034
I'd like to smack his face.

678
00:46:20,202 --> 00:46:21,869
The red-haired guy, looks like a farmer?

679
00:46:22,037 --> 00:46:24,080
The guy's hands are all over me.

680
00:46:24,247 --> 00:46:28,626
So I told him, "Keep your fucking hands
off me, or I'll cut them off."

681
00:46:30,212 --> 00:46:31,629
She means it.

682
00:46:31,797 --> 00:46:34,965
You don't know how lucky he is.
I just mention this to Vinnie...

683
00:46:35,634 --> 00:46:38,761
How can you mention it?
Vinnie would kill him.

684
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:42,807
If I don't, he'll kill the miserable
bastard, then Vinnie will be there for life.

685
00:46:42,974 --> 00:46:45,601
You think you got problems.
What about Jeannie's kid?

686
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:49,522
He was in an argument. A $10 card game.
He pulls out a gun.

687
00:46:49,689 --> 00:46:53,484
The gun goes off. Some kid gets killed.
When the grandmother hears it...

688
00:46:53,652 --> 00:46:57,571
and finds out he's jailed, she has a heart
attack and drops dead right on the spot.

689
00:46:57,739 --> 00:47:02,159
Now Jeannie has a husband and son
in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.

690
00:47:02,994 --> 00:47:05,746
- Jeannie drinks.
- Maybe she's depressed.

691
00:47:05,914 --> 00:47:08,082
Give me a break. She's drunk.

692
00:47:09,543 --> 00:47:12,878
As soon as something happens,
you make them out to be saints.

693
00:47:13,046 --> 00:47:18,008
They had bad skin and wore too much
makeup. They didn't look very good.

694
00:47:18,343 --> 00:47:20,970
They looked beat-up.
And the stuff they wore...

695
00:47:21,138 --> 00:47:23,013
was thrown together and cheap.

696
00:47:23,181 --> 00:47:25,850
A lot of pantsuits and double-knits.

697
00:47:27,727 --> 00:47:29,478
She spends her life in a nightgown.

698
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:31,939
The woman is no angel, believe me.

699
00:47:32,107 --> 00:47:34,608
They talked about their rotten kids...

700
00:47:34,776 --> 00:47:37,361
and about beating them
with broom handles and belts.

701
00:47:37,529 --> 00:47:40,447
And that the kids
still didn't pay any attention.

702
00:47:40,615 --> 00:47:42,533
When Henry picked me up, I was dizzy.

703
00:47:42,701 --> 00:47:45,369
I don't know if I could live like that.

704
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:50,082
God forbid, what would happen
if you had to go to prison?

705
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:51,584
Karen.

706
00:47:52,252 --> 00:47:54,253
Mickey said that Jeannie's husband...

707
00:47:54,421 --> 00:47:56,714
Do you know why Jeannie's husband
went to the can?

708
00:47:56,882 --> 00:48:00,259
Because of Jeannie.
He wanted to get away from her.

709
00:48:00,427 --> 00:48:05,139
Let me tell you something.
Nobody goes to jail unless they want to.

710
00:48:05,473 --> 00:48:07,433
Unless they make themselves get caught.

711
00:48:07,601 --> 00:48:09,351
They don't have things organized.

712
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:12,813
I know what I'm doing.
I've got things organized with these guys.

713
00:48:12,981 --> 00:48:17,359
You know who goes to jail? Nigger
stickup men. Know why they get caught?

714
00:48:17,527 --> 00:48:20,529
Because they fall asleep
in the getaway car, Karen.

715
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:24,700
Come on, don't worry so much, sweetie.
Come here.

716
00:48:31,082 --> 00:48:33,792
After a while, it got to be all normal.

717
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:36,962
None of it seemed like crime.

718
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:39,423
It was more like Henry was enterprising...

719
00:48:39,591 --> 00:48:43,302
and that he and the guys made bucks
hustling while other guys...

720
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:46,472
were sitting on their asses
waiting for handouts.

721
00:48:47,265 --> 00:48:51,227
Our husbands weren't brain surgeons,
they were blue-collar guys.

722
00:48:51,394 --> 00:48:56,023
The only way they could make real extra
money was to go out and cut corners.

723
00:48:56,483 --> 00:48:58,984
Where's the strong box, you varmint?

724
00:49:05,367 --> 00:49:07,743
Don't fucking move! Don't move.

725
00:49:17,128 --> 00:49:19,880
- See you at the diner.
- I'm riding shotgun.

726
00:49:20,048 --> 00:49:22,716
Did you see him give it right over?

727
00:49:22,884 --> 00:49:25,552
Back to the hideout to split up the loot.

728
00:49:29,516 --> 00:49:31,809
We were all so very close.

729
00:49:31,977 --> 00:49:35,854
There were never any outsiders around.
Absolutely never.

730
00:49:36,022 --> 00:49:40,693
Being together all the time made
everything seem all the more normal.

731
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:42,194
Hello, Mrs. Hill. Police.

732
00:49:42,362 --> 00:49:46,657
I'm Detective Deacy. This is Detective
Silvestri. We have a search warrant.

733
00:49:46,825 --> 00:49:48,867
Would you read and sign it?

734
00:49:49,077 --> 00:49:50,536
- Anywhere?
- Yeah, anywhere.

735
00:49:50,704 --> 00:49:53,247
This'll take a while,
we have to go through everything.

736
00:49:53,415 --> 00:49:56,500
- You boys want some coffee?
- No coffee now, thanks.

737
00:49:57,544 --> 00:50:00,671
- Be careful.
- We'll just go about our business.

738
00:50:00,839 --> 00:50:03,215
There was always a little harassment.

739
00:50:03,383 --> 00:50:06,176
They wanted to talk to Henry
about this or that.

740
00:50:06,344 --> 00:50:09,555
They'd make me sign
their subpoenas or warrants.

741
00:50:09,723 --> 00:50:12,099
But mostly they just wanted a handout.

742
00:50:12,267 --> 00:50:15,644
A few bucks to keep things quiet
no matter what they found.

743
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:25,863
I always asked if they wanted coffee.
Some wives, like Mickey Conway...

744
00:50:26,072 --> 00:50:28,907
used to curse at them
and spit on the floor.

745
00:50:29,075 --> 00:50:32,661
She used to spit on her own floor.
That never made any sense to me.

746
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:35,873
It was better to be polite
and call the lawyer.

747
00:50:44,966 --> 00:50:49,470
We always did everything together,
and we always were in the same crowd.

748
00:50:49,637 --> 00:50:53,599
Anniversaries, christenings.
We only went to each other's houses.

749
00:50:55,769 --> 00:50:57,102
The women played cards.

750
00:50:57,270 --> 00:51:01,315
When kids were born, Mickey and Jimmy
were the first at the hospital.

751
00:51:01,483 --> 00:51:04,568
When we went to the Islands
or Vegas for vacation...

752
00:51:04,736 --> 00:51:05,986
we went together.

753
00:51:06,154 --> 00:51:09,198
No outsiders ever. It got to be normal.

754
00:51:09,366 --> 00:51:12,409
It got to where I was proud
that I had the kind of husband...

755
00:51:12,577 --> 00:51:16,288
who was willing to risk his neck
just to get us the little extras.

756
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:20,417
But I got Mom to watch the babies
tomorrow night.

757
00:51:20,585 --> 00:51:22,419
- Can't do it, Karen.
- Why not?

758
00:51:22,587 --> 00:51:25,255
I just can't. I got something lined up.

759
00:51:25,715 --> 00:51:28,884
But tomorrow's the only night
she can do it.

760
00:51:29,052 --> 00:51:32,638
- Pretty please?
- I can't. What do you want me to do?

761
00:51:34,057 --> 00:51:36,183
- I got to go.
- Wait a minute.

762
00:51:37,352 --> 00:51:39,645
I wanted to go shopping.
Can I get some money?

763
00:51:39,813 --> 00:51:41,522
How much do you need?

764
00:51:43,358 --> 00:51:45,192
- How much?
- That much.

765
00:51:50,031 --> 00:51:52,866
This much. Give me a kiss.

766
00:51:56,496 --> 00:51:58,122
See you later.

767
00:52:03,169 --> 00:52:04,420
All right.

768
00:52:36,578 --> 00:52:38,495
Welcome home, Batts.

769
00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:41,999
Hi, how are you?

770
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:45,794
Sit down. Have a drink.
Give them all a drink.

771
00:52:46,421 --> 00:52:48,922
And give those Irish hoodlums a drink.

772
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:50,883
There's only one Irishman here.

773
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:53,051
It's a celebration, fellas.

774
00:52:53,261 --> 00:52:56,388
- Top of the morning to you.
- It's good to be home.

775
00:53:00,727 --> 00:53:02,311
This is my friend Jimmy.

776
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:05,105
Henry. It's his joint. This is Lisa.

777
00:53:06,483 --> 00:53:08,108
Tommy. All dressed up.

778
00:53:08,276 --> 00:53:11,236
All grown up and doing the town.
Look at this.

779
00:53:11,404 --> 00:53:14,198
Forgot you were having a party
for this mug.

780
00:53:14,908 --> 00:53:16,450
Come here.

781
00:53:16,618 --> 00:53:18,911
I'll say hello. Billy, how are you?

782
00:53:19,078 --> 00:53:21,914
Get over here.
I haven't seen you in six years.

783
00:53:22,081 --> 00:53:25,167
Jesus Christ Almighty. You look terrific.

784
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:27,211
Watch the suit.

785
00:53:27,754 --> 00:53:30,923
You little prick. I've
known you all my life.

786
00:53:31,424 --> 00:53:35,260
- Don't get too big on me.
- Just don't bust my balls.

787
00:53:35,428 --> 00:53:39,431
If I was gonna break your balls,
I'd say, "Go get your shine box."

788
00:53:41,142 --> 00:53:43,393
This kid was great.

789
00:53:43,561 --> 00:53:45,687
They used to call him "Spitshine Tommy."

790
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:49,900
He'd make your shoes look like
fucking mirrors. Excuse my language.

791
00:53:50,068 --> 00:53:54,029
He was terrific. He was the best.
He made a lot of money, too.

792
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:56,907
No more shines, Billy.

793
00:53:57,575 --> 00:53:59,034
- What?
- I said no more shines.

794
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:01,954
You've been away a long time.
They didn't tell you.

795
00:54:02,121 --> 00:54:04,248
I don't shine shoes anymore.

796
00:54:04,582 --> 00:54:08,627
Relax. What's got into you? I'm breaking
your balls a little, that's all.

797
00:54:08,795 --> 00:54:10,087
I'm only kidding with you.

798
00:54:10,255 --> 00:54:13,590
Sometimes you don't sound like it.
There's a lot of people around.

799
00:54:13,758 --> 00:54:15,884
I'm only kidding. We're having a party.

800
00:54:16,052 --> 00:54:19,805
I haven't seen you in a long time
and you get fucking fresh.

801
00:54:19,973 --> 00:54:21,890
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.

802
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:24,434
I'm sorry, too. It's okay. No problem.

803
00:54:29,023 --> 00:54:31,149
Now go home and get your fucking
shine box.

804
00:54:31,317 --> 00:54:32,818
Motherfucking mutt!

805
00:54:32,986 --> 00:54:35,404
You fucking piece of shit!

806
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:37,864
Come on, come on!

807
00:54:38,992 --> 00:54:41,743
He bought his fucking button!
That fake old tough guy!

808
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:44,204
You bought your fucking button!

809
00:54:44,372 --> 00:54:46,665
- Don't get nervous.
- You motherfucker!

810
00:54:46,833 --> 00:54:49,626
Keep that motherfucker here!
Keep him here.

811
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:53,338
Come on, you fucking feel strong?

812
00:54:53,506 --> 00:54:56,633
Sorry. Tommy gets a little loaded.
He doesn't mean any disrespect.

813
00:54:56,801 --> 00:54:59,261
He doesn't mean any disrespect?
Are you nuts?

814
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:02,889
Teach this kid a little fucking manners.
What's right is right.

815
00:55:03,057 --> 00:55:05,517
- You understand what I'm saying?
- It's all right.

816
00:55:05,685 --> 00:55:10,063
We're hugging and kissing over here
and then he acts like a fucking jerk.

817
00:55:12,025 --> 00:55:14,860
You insulted him a little bit.
You got a little out of order.

818
00:55:15,028 --> 00:55:17,321
- I didn't.
- You insulted him a little.

819
00:55:17,488 --> 00:55:20,741
- I didn't insult anybody. Give us a drink.
- Okay.

820
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,410
Let's have some drinks.
Drinks on the house.

821
00:55:23,578 --> 00:55:25,662
No, have the drink with me.

822
00:55:26,873 --> 00:55:28,832
The drinks are on the house.

823
00:55:30,543 --> 00:55:33,629
I fucked kids like that in the can.
In the ass.

824
00:55:33,921 --> 00:55:35,964
Fucking break up my party.

825
00:55:43,097 --> 00:55:45,974
You've been away for six years.
It's different now.

826
00:55:46,142 --> 00:55:48,477
I did my fucking time, Jimmy.

827
00:55:49,312 --> 00:55:53,482
I came home and I want what I got to get.
I got mouths to feed.

828
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:56,318
- You're gonna get it.
- You understand?

829
00:55:59,072 --> 00:56:00,781
Get the door!

830
00:56:15,672 --> 00:56:18,048
Let me shoot him
in his big, fucking mouth!

831
00:56:18,216 --> 00:56:19,758
Let's shoot him.

832
00:56:37,694 --> 00:56:39,653
Fucking mutt dented my shoes.

833
00:56:39,821 --> 00:56:42,447
His whole crew is going to be
looking for him.

834
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:49,162
This is bad. What do we do with him?
We can't just dump him on the street.

835
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:52,958
I know a place upstate.
They'll never find him. More tablecloths.

836
00:56:53,126 --> 00:56:55,752
I didn't want to get blood on your floor.

837
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:01,299
Go open your trunk.

838
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,389
We'll get a shovel at my mother's house.

839
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:20,736
She has a shovel here somewhere.
Quiet, I don't want to wake her up.

840
00:57:22,488 --> 00:57:25,115
Look who's here.

841
00:57:26,325 --> 00:57:28,285
What did you do? What happened?

842
00:57:28,453 --> 00:57:30,996
I hit something on the road.
Jimmy will tell you.

843
00:57:31,164 --> 00:57:33,331
What happened to him?

844
00:57:34,375 --> 00:57:38,253
I haven't seen you in so long.
What happened to him?

845
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:40,297
You, too. How are you?

846
00:57:40,465 --> 00:57:41,673
Why are you up so late?

847
00:57:41,841 --> 00:57:46,178
He came in. You came in.
I'm so happy to see him.

848
00:57:46,345 --> 00:57:50,182
Go inside. Make yourselves comfortable.
I'll make you something to eat.

849
00:57:50,349 --> 00:57:53,101
- Go to sleep. We're leaving.
- I can't. Not while he's home.

850
00:57:53,269 --> 00:57:55,562
I haven't seen him in so long.
I want to see him.

851
00:57:55,730 --> 00:57:56,980
You go inside.

852
00:57:57,148 --> 00:57:58,440
This stuff is like lead.

853
00:57:58,608 --> 00:58:01,693
Tell me, where you been?
I haven't seen you.

854
00:58:01,861 --> 00:58:04,571
You haven't called. Where have you been?

855
00:58:04,739 --> 00:58:07,657
- I been working nights.
- And?

856
00:58:07,825 --> 00:58:09,618
And tonight we were out late.

857
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:13,205
We took a ride out to the country
and hit a deer.

858
00:58:13,372 --> 00:58:16,374
That's where all the blood is from.
Jimmy told you.

859
00:58:17,043 --> 00:58:20,212
It reminds me, I need this knife.
I'm taking this, okay?

860
00:58:20,379 --> 00:58:22,214
- Okay.
- Just for a while.

861
00:58:22,381 --> 00:58:23,799
The poor thing.

862
00:58:23,966 --> 00:58:27,719
We hit the deer and his paw...
What do you call it?

863
00:58:27,887 --> 00:58:29,513
The paw.

864
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:32,098
- The hoof.
- Got caught in the grill.

865
00:58:32,266 --> 00:58:34,100
I got to hack it off.

866
00:58:34,268 --> 00:58:36,561
Ma, it's a sin to leave it there.

867
00:58:36,729 --> 00:58:38,563
I'll bring the knife back.

868
00:58:39,065 --> 00:58:40,899
- Delicious.
- Thank you.

869
00:58:41,108 --> 00:58:43,318
Why don't you get yourself a nice girl?

870
00:58:43,486 --> 00:58:45,320
I do, almost every night.

871
00:58:45,488 --> 00:58:48,031
But get yourself a girl
so you could settle down.

872
00:58:48,199 --> 00:58:53,078
I do, every night. Then I'm free.
I love you, I want to be with you.

873
00:58:53,246 --> 00:58:54,663
Settle down.

874
00:58:56,415 --> 00:58:58,041
How's your friend Henry?

875
00:58:58,209 --> 00:59:00,585
What's the matter? You don't talk much.

876
00:59:00,753 --> 00:59:02,504
Talk. What are you quiet for?

877
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:05,090
You don't eat much, you don't talk much.

878
00:59:05,258 --> 00:59:07,759
- I'm just listening.
- Something wrong?

879
00:59:07,927 --> 00:59:11,471
When we were kids,
the compares used to visit one another.

880
00:59:11,681 --> 00:59:16,434
There was this man. He would never talk.
He'd just sit there all night, not a word.

881
00:59:16,853 --> 00:59:21,147
They say to him, "What's the matter?
Don't you say anything?"

882
00:59:21,774 --> 00:59:25,443
He says, "What am I going to say,
that my wife two-times me?"

883
00:59:26,028 --> 00:59:29,364
So she says, "Shut up!
You're always talking."

884
00:59:31,242 --> 00:59:33,743
But in Italian, it sounds much nicer.

885
00:59:33,911 --> 00:59:35,453
- Cornuto contento.
- That's it.

886
00:59:35,621 --> 00:59:39,249
- What does that mean?
- It means he's content to be a jerk.

887
00:59:39,792 --> 00:59:42,335
He doesn't care who knows it.

888
00:59:42,712 --> 00:59:45,297
- Did Tommy tell you about my painting?
- No.

889
00:59:46,299 --> 00:59:47,841
Look at this.

890
00:59:48,009 --> 00:59:49,301
It's beautiful.

891
00:59:49,468 --> 00:59:52,554
I like it. One dog goes one way
and the other goes the other.

892
00:59:52,722 --> 00:59:55,140
One's facing east, the other west.
So what?

893
00:59:55,308 --> 00:59:58,727
He's saying, "What do you want from me?"
The guy's got nice white hair.

894
00:59:58,895 --> 01:00:01,062
Beautiful. The dog looks the same.

895
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:03,231
Looks like somebody we know.

896
01:00:04,984 --> 01:00:07,110
Without the beard. It's him.

897
01:00:09,655 --> 01:00:10,947
It's him.

898
01:00:20,458 --> 01:00:21,791
What the fuck is that?

899
01:00:21,959 --> 01:00:24,544
For most of the guys,
killings were accepted.

900
01:00:24,712 --> 01:00:27,422
Murder was the only way
everybody stayed in line.

901
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:30,842
You got out of line, you got whacked.
Everybody knew the rules.

902
01:00:31,010 --> 01:00:34,471
Sometimes, even if people didn't
get out of line, they got whacked.

903
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:39,059
Hits became a habit. Guys would get
into arguments over nothing.

904
01:00:39,226 --> 01:00:41,436
Before you knew it, one was dead.

905
01:00:41,604 --> 01:00:43,813
They were shooting each other
all the time.

906
01:00:43,981 --> 01:00:47,525
Shooting people was a normal thing.
It was no big deal.

907
01:00:49,195 --> 01:00:52,030
We had a serious problem with Billy Batts.

908
01:00:52,198 --> 01:00:56,326
This was really a touchy thing.
Tommy killed a made guy.

909
01:00:56,494 --> 01:01:00,038
Batts was part of the Gambino crew
and was considered untouchable.

910
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:04,292
Before you touched a made guy,
you had to have a good reason.

911
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:07,212
You had to have a sit-down
and you'd better get an okay...

912
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:09,714
or you'd be the one who got whacked.

913
01:01:21,894 --> 01:01:23,728
Saturday night was for wives...

914
01:01:23,896 --> 01:01:27,065
but Friday night at the Copa
was for the girlfriends.

915
01:01:28,901 --> 01:01:31,152
Last week, we saw Sammy Davis, Jr.

916
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:34,239
You got to see this show.
What a performer.

917
01:01:34,407 --> 01:01:37,909
He does these impersonations.
You'd think it was the real people.

918
01:01:38,077 --> 01:01:42,163
It's unbelievable. You could see
how a white girl could fall for him.

919
01:01:42,498 --> 01:01:43,581
What?

920
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:48,712
Not me. But you could see how
some girls could. Like that Swedish girl.

921
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:51,047
So you condone that stuff.

922
01:01:51,215 --> 01:01:52,549
Take it easy.

923
01:01:54,218 --> 01:01:57,095
I don't want to be kissing
Nat King Cole over here.

924
01:01:57,263 --> 01:01:58,930
No, I'm not talking about me.

925
01:02:00,599 --> 01:02:02,517
But, you know, he's got personality.

926
01:02:02,685 --> 01:02:04,144
Personality?

927
01:02:05,604 --> 01:02:08,606
He's talented.
I understand what you're saying.

928
01:02:08,774 --> 01:02:12,110
But watch what you say.
People get the wrong impression.

929
01:02:12,278 --> 01:02:14,696
I just said he was talented,
you're unbelievable.

930
01:02:14,864 --> 01:02:17,365
Just leave it alone now,
I understand what you said.

931
01:02:17,533 --> 01:02:19,576
He's talented. Leave it at that.

932
01:03:58,217 --> 01:04:00,426
No? Not even Uncle Paulie?

933
01:04:17,069 --> 01:04:19,362
What did you hear about that thing?

934
01:04:20,030 --> 01:04:23,074
- The Brooklyn thing?
- No, the guy from downtown.

935
01:04:23,742 --> 01:04:26,911
- The guy from where Christie lived?
- No.

936
01:04:28,038 --> 01:04:31,249
The guy who disappeared,
the one they made the beef on.

937
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:33,918
- Know the guy I mean?
- Yeah.

938
01:04:34,086 --> 01:04:38,173
His name was Batts. His people
are driving everyone crazy looking for him.

939
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:40,049
Nobody knows what happened to him.

940
01:04:40,217 --> 01:04:44,262
He came into the joint that night
and then just disappeared. That was it.

941
01:04:46,098 --> 01:04:50,268
All right. Keep your eyes open.
They're busting my balls over it.

942
01:04:50,769 --> 01:04:52,770
- All right?
- Yeah.

943
01:04:55,274 --> 01:04:57,358
Okay, everybody, let's eat.

944
01:05:03,115 --> 01:05:05,200
I want my money.

945
01:05:06,285 --> 01:05:07,660
He owes it.

946
01:05:16,545 --> 01:05:19,339
You know that thing
we took care of upstate?

947
01:05:19,506 --> 01:05:22,842
- Paulie was talking about that.
- Got to get it out of there.

948
01:05:23,510 --> 01:05:26,137
They just sold the property
to make condominiums.

949
01:05:26,305 --> 01:05:29,974
- It's been six months.
- We got to get it out of there right away.

950
01:05:42,404 --> 01:05:46,824
Henry, hurry up. My mother's making
fried peppers and sausage for us.

951
01:05:50,371 --> 01:05:52,622
- Here's an arm.
- Very funny, guys.

952
01:05:52,790 --> 01:05:54,165
Here's a leg.

953
01:05:54,333 --> 01:05:55,833
Here's a wing.

954
01:05:56,543 --> 01:06:00,880
What do you like, the leg or the wing?
Or you still go for the hearts and lungs?

955
01:06:02,258 --> 01:06:04,008
Oh, that's so bad.

956
01:06:10,808 --> 01:06:12,684
What happened to the car?

957
01:06:13,143 --> 01:06:14,811
I hit a skunk, all right?

958
01:06:14,979 --> 01:06:16,688
Go with your mother.

959
01:06:17,731 --> 01:06:19,565
It's disgusting, Henry.

960
01:06:23,696 --> 01:06:26,656
I set up Janice in an apartment
around the corner from The Suite.

961
01:06:26,824 --> 01:06:29,409
That way I was able to stay over
a couple of nights a week.

962
01:06:29,576 --> 01:06:30,827
This is my new antique lamp.

963
01:06:30,995 --> 01:06:34,038
Karen was home with the kids.
She never asked questions.

964
01:06:34,206 --> 01:06:36,040
The furniture's all Maurice Valencia.

965
01:06:36,208 --> 01:06:37,834
Looks like Roma.

966
01:06:38,002 --> 01:06:40,253
This is all silk. This is from Siam.

967
01:06:42,256 --> 01:06:44,048
Come see my bedroom.

968
01:06:44,758 --> 01:06:48,594
- Tommy, will you take him?
- I'll eat this fucking dog tonight.

969
01:06:52,558 --> 01:06:54,726
Love that crystal ball or what?

970
01:06:56,228 --> 01:06:59,188
This is where we spend most of our time.

971
01:07:00,983 --> 01:07:03,276
I love the floral arrangements.

972
01:07:05,279 --> 01:07:06,321
French.

973
01:07:06,488 --> 01:07:10,408
Janice and I were having so much fun,
she started screwing up at work.

974
01:07:10,576 --> 01:07:13,036
I had to straighten out
her boss a little bit.

975
01:07:13,203 --> 01:07:16,748
Janice can do what she wants to do.
Got it?

976
01:07:16,915 --> 01:07:21,294
Just try to run. Hang up once more,
and you'll deal with me.

977
01:07:26,884 --> 01:07:29,093
Come on, get off of her.

978
01:07:29,428 --> 01:07:31,137
You're an animal.

979
01:07:44,109 --> 01:07:47,862
Spider, on your way over here,
bring me a Cutty and water.

980
01:07:50,282 --> 01:07:52,617
- Did you guys eat?
- I'm starving.

981
01:07:54,119 --> 01:07:56,120
- I'll play these.
- You'll play those?

982
01:07:56,288 --> 01:07:58,289
Do I stutter? I play those.

983
01:08:02,294 --> 01:08:04,295
What am I? A mirage?

984
01:08:04,546 --> 01:08:07,173
Where's my fucking drink?
I asked you for a drink.

985
01:08:07,341 --> 01:08:10,009
- You wanted a drink?
- I asked you for one.

986
01:08:10,177 --> 01:08:13,096
I thought you said, "I'm
all right, Spider."

987
01:08:13,889 --> 01:08:15,807
Am I on a pay-no-mind list?

988
01:08:15,974 --> 01:08:20,186
No, I heard someone say "Spider, Spider."

989
01:08:20,354 --> 01:08:23,648
- I thought it was Henry.
- You're a mumbling, stuttering little fuck.

990
01:08:23,816 --> 01:08:25,900
I thought you said, "I'm
all right, Spider."

991
01:08:26,068 --> 01:08:27,735
You ain't all right.

992
01:08:27,903 --> 01:08:30,071
No, I thought you said you were all right.

993
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:33,157
I am all right! You ain't, you prick.

994
01:08:35,285 --> 01:08:38,371
You've been doing this all fucking night
to me, you motherfucker!

995
01:08:38,539 --> 01:08:40,706
He wants a drink now? I'll bring it.

996
01:08:40,874 --> 01:08:43,501
Go get me a fucking drink!
Move it, you little prick.

997
01:08:43,669 --> 01:08:46,254
You walk like fucking Stepin Fetchit.

998
01:08:46,505 --> 01:08:48,005
For everybody else you run.

999
01:08:48,173 --> 01:08:52,176
Run for me, you prick!
Dance, dance the fucking drink back here!

1000
01:08:52,344 --> 01:08:54,095
What's that movie that Bogart made?

1001
01:08:54,263 --> 01:08:56,889
- Where he played a cowboy.
- The Oklahoma Kid.

1002
01:08:57,057 --> 01:09:01,102
- Shane?
- Oklahoma Kid, that's me!

1003
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:03,855
You fucking varmint. Dance!

1004
01:09:04,022 --> 01:09:06,023
Yahoo, you motherfucker!

1005
01:09:06,525 --> 01:09:08,693
Round up those fucking wagons.

1006
01:09:14,783 --> 01:09:16,409
Now he's moving.

1007
01:09:17,369 --> 01:09:19,996
- Henry, what happened?
- He shot him in the foot, Tommy.

1008
01:09:20,164 --> 01:09:24,375
He's fucking fine. So he got shot in the
foot. What is it? A big fucking deal?

1009
01:09:24,543 --> 01:09:27,086
- Get a towel.
- Nice fucking game.

1010
01:09:28,589 --> 01:09:33,342
Take him to Ben Casey, the little prick. Let
him crawl like he crawls for the drinks.

1011
01:09:33,886 --> 01:09:36,554
Take him to the doctor down the street.

1012
01:09:36,972 --> 01:09:38,723
Bones are all shattered.

1013
01:09:38,891 --> 01:09:40,683
Don't get me upset, now.

1014
01:09:40,851 --> 01:09:44,395
Don't make a big fucking thing out of it,
Spider, you little prick.

1015
01:09:44,563 --> 01:09:47,231
You trying to make me think
what the fuck I did here.

1016
01:09:47,399 --> 01:09:49,275
It was an accident.

1017
01:09:49,610 --> 01:09:51,819
- Little fucking actor.
- I got a great hand here.

1018
01:09:51,987 --> 01:09:53,404
- You in or out?
- Yeah, I'm in.

1019
01:09:53,572 --> 01:09:55,448
- $800.
- $800?

1020
01:09:56,325 --> 01:09:59,952
You haven't been home in two weeks.
You're not going out tonight!

1021
01:10:00,454 --> 01:10:03,581
Karen, will you grow up! Stop!
I'm still gonna go out!

1022
01:10:03,749 --> 01:10:05,625
Not without your car keys, you're not.

1023
01:10:05,792 --> 01:10:07,793
Are you nuts? What's your problem?

1024
01:10:07,961 --> 01:10:10,171
Yes, I'm nuts. Something's going on.

1025
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:13,257
- Stop with that. Enough! Stop with that.
- No!

1026
01:10:13,425 --> 01:10:17,136
I'm telling you, I look in your face
and I know that you're lying!

1027
01:10:19,389 --> 01:10:21,599
- Get out! Get out!
- Shut up.

1028
01:10:21,767 --> 01:10:22,892
Get out of my life!

1029
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:26,020
You're fucked in the head, Karen.
This is all in your mind.

1030
01:10:26,188 --> 01:10:28,523
- You're a lousy bastard!
- You got a problem.

1031
01:10:28,690 --> 01:10:32,485
Go ahead, go to your ready-made whores.
That's all you're good for!

1032
01:10:32,736 --> 01:10:36,197
Get out of my life! I can't stand you!

1033
01:10:46,959 --> 01:10:48,793
Spider, what's your rush?

1034
01:10:51,338 --> 01:10:53,047
- Here you go.
- Thank you, Spider.

1035
01:10:53,215 --> 01:10:57,468
Spider, that fucking bandage on your foot
is bigger than your fucking head.

1036
01:10:59,763 --> 01:11:03,558
Next thing you know, he's gonna be
coming in one of these fucking walkers.

1037
01:11:03,725 --> 01:11:05,476
Even though you got that, you can dance?

1038
01:11:05,644 --> 01:11:10,231
Give us a couple of fucking steps, Spider.
You fucking bullshitter, you.

1039
01:11:10,482 --> 01:11:12,692
Tell the truth.
You're looking for sympathy?

1040
01:11:12,859 --> 01:11:15,152
Why don't you go fuck yourself, Tommy?

1041
01:11:19,825 --> 01:11:22,326
I didn't fucking hear right.
Can't believe what I heard.

1042
01:11:22,494 --> 01:11:24,996
Spider, here. This is for you. Attaboy.

1043
01:11:25,789 --> 01:11:28,791
I got respect for this kid.
He's got a lot of fucking balls.

1044
01:11:28,959 --> 01:11:31,419
Good for you.
Don't take no shit off nobody.

1045
01:11:31,837 --> 01:11:35,423
He shoots him in the foot,
he tells him to go fuck himself.

1046
01:11:36,967 --> 01:11:40,303
Are you gonna let this fucking punk
get away with that?

1047
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:43,055
What's the matter?
What's the world coming to?

1048
01:11:46,643 --> 01:11:49,687
That's what the fucking world
is coming to. How do you like that?

1049
01:11:49,855 --> 01:11:53,107
- How's that, all right?
- What's the fucking matter with you?

1050
01:11:53,275 --> 01:11:55,192
What are you, stupid or what?

1051
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:58,654
Tommy, I'm kidding with you.
Are you a fucking sick maniac?

1052
01:11:58,822 --> 01:12:01,782
How do I know if you're kidding?
You're breaking my fucking balls?

1053
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:04,452
I'm fucking kidding with you,
you fucking shoot the guy?

1054
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:05,828
He's dead.

1055
01:12:07,414 --> 01:12:09,957
Good shot. What do you want from me?
Good shot.

1056
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:11,375
You can't miss at this distance.

1057
01:12:11,543 --> 01:12:13,336
You got a problem
with what I did, Anthony?

1058
01:12:13,503 --> 01:12:14,545
No.

1059
01:12:14,713 --> 01:12:18,424
Fucking rat. His whole family's all rats.
He would've grown up to be a rat.

1060
01:12:18,592 --> 01:12:20,760
Stupid bastard! I can't
fucking believe you.

1061
01:12:20,927 --> 01:12:24,805
Now you're going to dig the hole.
I got no fucking lime.

1062
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:29,143
I'll dig the hole. I don't give a fuck.
Is it the first hole I dug?

1063
01:12:29,436 --> 01:12:32,229
I'll dig the fucking hole.
Where are the shovels?

1064
01:12:33,231 --> 01:12:34,815
- Hello.
- Hello?

1065
01:12:35,025 --> 01:12:37,568
This is Karen Hill. I wanna talk to you.

1066
01:12:38,654 --> 01:12:41,405
Hello? Don't hang up on me!

1067
01:12:41,573 --> 01:12:43,407
I want to talk to you!

1068
01:12:43,700 --> 01:12:46,535
You keep away from my husband,
you hear me?

1069
01:12:47,746 --> 01:12:50,247
Hello? Open the door!

1070
01:12:52,125 --> 01:12:53,584
Answer me!

1071
01:12:54,127 --> 01:12:56,504
I'm gonna tell everyone
who walks in this building...

1072
01:12:56,672 --> 01:12:59,382
that in 2R, Rossi,
you are nothing but a whore!

1073
01:12:59,549 --> 01:13:01,175
Is this the superintendent?

1074
01:13:01,343 --> 01:13:03,719
Yes, I want you to know, sir,
that you have a whore...

1075
01:13:03,887 --> 01:13:05,429
living in 2R!

1076
01:13:05,597 --> 01:13:08,724
Rossi, Janice Rossi. Do you hear me?

1077
01:13:09,184 --> 01:13:10,685
He's my husband!

1078
01:13:10,852 --> 01:13:13,562
Get your own goddamn man!

1079
01:13:14,773 --> 01:13:16,315
Wake up, Henry.

1080
01:13:29,746 --> 01:13:31,455
What are you doing?

1081
01:13:34,084 --> 01:13:37,002
- Karen, are you crazy?
- I am crazy.

1082
01:13:38,296 --> 01:13:40,923
I'm crazy enough to kill both of you.

1083
01:13:43,802 --> 01:13:45,594
Karen, take it easy.

1084
01:13:49,099 --> 01:13:51,058
- Okay?
- Do you love her?

1085
01:13:52,644 --> 01:13:53,811
Do you?

1086
01:13:54,855 --> 01:13:56,939
- Do you?
- Karen...

1087
01:13:59,192 --> 01:14:01,652
I love you. You know I love you.

1088
01:14:02,821 --> 01:14:04,530
You don't.

1089
01:14:06,074 --> 01:14:07,783
No, you don't.

1090
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:11,120
Please, be careful. Baby, don't.

1091
01:14:11,913 --> 01:14:15,207
But still I couldn't hurt him.
How could I hurt him?

1092
01:14:15,375 --> 01:14:18,085
I couldn't even bring myself to leave him.

1093
01:14:18,253 --> 01:14:19,670
The truth was...

1094
01:14:19,838 --> 01:14:22,131
that no matter how bad I felt...

1095
01:14:22,841 --> 01:14:25,342
I was still very attracted to him.

1096
01:14:26,511 --> 01:14:28,846
Why should I give him to someone else?

1097
01:14:29,014 --> 01:14:30,848
Why should she win?

1098
01:14:34,561 --> 01:14:36,437
Just put it down.

1099
01:14:37,606 --> 01:14:40,024
You know I love you, don't you?

1100
01:14:40,275 --> 01:14:42,359
You're all I want, Karen.

1101
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:45,988
Please put the gun down, Karen.

1102
01:14:46,865 --> 01:14:49,533
Baby, come on.

1103
01:15:03,465 --> 01:15:05,841
What are you, fucking crazy, Karen?

1104
01:15:07,219 --> 01:15:10,012
I got enough to worry about
getting whacked on the street!

1105
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:13,849
I got to fucking come home for this?

1106
01:15:14,392 --> 01:15:16,393
I should fucking kill you!

1107
01:15:17,687 --> 01:15:19,522
How does it feel?

1108
01:15:20,565 --> 01:15:22,525
How does it feel, Karen?

1109
01:15:39,125 --> 01:15:41,085
I'm sorry!

1110
01:15:48,093 --> 01:15:50,052
Hi, Jimmy! How are you?

1111
01:15:50,929 --> 01:15:53,931
- Looking good.
- Thank you. Good to see you.

1112
01:15:54,099 --> 01:15:56,559
- Hi, Paulie!
- Hi, honey. How are you?

1113
01:15:56,726 --> 01:15:57,685
Good.

1114
01:15:57,853 --> 01:16:00,563
- Why don't you go get cigarettes, okay?
- Sure.

1115
01:16:01,439 --> 01:16:03,899
- Any of you need anything?
- I'm all right.

1116
01:16:04,276 --> 01:16:07,111
- Want anything to drink? A beer?
- No.

1117
01:16:07,279 --> 01:16:09,864
- Chinese food?
- No, come on, sit down.

1118
01:16:16,621 --> 01:16:19,456
Karen came to the house.
She's very upset.

1119
01:16:21,501 --> 01:16:22,918
You gotta straighten this thing out.

1120
01:16:23,086 --> 01:16:26,213
We got to have calm now. We don't know
what the hell she's gonna do.

1121
01:16:26,381 --> 01:16:28,632
She's getting all hysterical.
She gets very excited.

1122
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:32,678
She's wild. And you got to take it easy.
You got children.

1123
01:16:33,638 --> 01:16:37,016
I'm not saying you gotta back to her
this minute, but you gotta go back.

1124
01:16:37,183 --> 01:16:39,643
It's the only way.
You gotta keep up appearances.

1125
01:16:39,811 --> 01:16:42,271
The two of them come over every day,
commiserating.

1126
01:16:42,439 --> 01:16:44,398
I can't have it.

1127
01:16:45,567 --> 01:16:47,902
I can't do it, Henry.

1128
01:16:48,069 --> 01:16:51,155
Nobody says that you can't do
what you wanna do.

1129
01:16:51,323 --> 01:16:53,949
We all know that. I mean,
this is what it is.

1130
01:16:54,117 --> 01:16:56,869
We know what it is.
You have to do the right thing.

1131
01:16:57,037 --> 01:16:59,371
You have to go home to the family,
you understand?

1132
01:16:59,539 --> 01:17:02,166
You got to go home, okay? Look at me.

1133
01:17:02,459 --> 01:17:04,668
You gotta go home. Smarten up.

1134
01:17:05,378 --> 01:17:06,921
- All right?
- All right.

1135
01:17:07,088 --> 01:17:08,631
I'm gonna talk to Karen.

1136
01:17:08,798 --> 01:17:12,343
I'll straighten this out.
I know just what to say to her.

1137
01:17:12,844 --> 01:17:14,845
I'm gonna tell her you'll go back to her...

1138
01:17:15,013 --> 01:17:17,890
and it'll be just the way
it was when you were first married...

1139
01:17:18,058 --> 01:17:19,934
your romance, it's gonna be beautiful.

1140
01:17:20,101 --> 01:17:22,102
I know how to talk to her,
especially to her.

1141
01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:24,730
Jimmy and Tommy are going down
to Tampa this weekend...

1142
01:17:24,898 --> 01:17:26,023
to pick up something for me.

1143
01:17:26,191 --> 01:17:27,900
Instead, you go with Jimmy.

1144
01:17:28,068 --> 01:17:29,318
You come with me, we'll go down.

1145
01:17:29,486 --> 01:17:32,029
Have a good time.
Take some time for yourself. Relax.

1146
01:17:32,197 --> 01:17:34,031
Sit in the sun. Take a couple days off.

1147
01:17:34,199 --> 01:17:36,033
- We'll have a good time.
- Enjoy yourselves.

1148
01:17:36,201 --> 01:17:38,744
And when you come back,
you go back to Karen.

1149
01:17:39,496 --> 01:17:41,205
Please, there's no other way.

1150
01:17:41,373 --> 01:17:43,958
You're not gonna get a divorce.
We're not animali.

1151
01:17:44,125 --> 01:17:46,710
No divorce. She'll never divorce him.

1152
01:17:48,505 --> 01:17:51,382
She'll kill him, but she won't divorce him.

1153
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:57,388
You gonna pay us?

1154
01:18:03,728 --> 01:18:06,772
- You gonna pay?
- Give us the fucking money!

1155
01:18:07,315 --> 01:18:09,358
I can't, I swear.

1156
01:18:10,902 --> 01:18:12,194
Let's go.

1157
01:18:20,745 --> 01:18:23,414
- We'll throw the bastard to the lions.
- No!

1158
01:18:23,581 --> 01:18:26,291
What fucking lions?
I ain't going near any lions, Jimmy!

1159
01:18:26,459 --> 01:18:28,794
- Let's throw him over the moat.
- All right.

1160
01:18:28,962 --> 01:18:30,337
I'll get the money!

1161
01:18:30,505 --> 01:18:33,132
They must really feed each other
to the lions down there...

1162
01:18:33,299 --> 01:18:35,050
because the guy gave the money right up.

1163
01:18:35,218 --> 01:18:36,844
I swear to Christ, I'll get the money.

1164
01:18:37,012 --> 01:18:39,138
We got to spend the rest of the weekend
at the track.

1165
01:18:39,764 --> 01:18:40,931
Yeah. They mean business.

1166
01:18:41,099 --> 01:18:43,684
Then, I couldn't believe what happened.

1167
01:18:44,102 --> 01:18:46,603
When we got home,
we were all over the newspaper.

1168
01:18:46,771 --> 01:18:49,982
At first, I didn't even know
why we got picked up.

1169
01:18:50,150 --> 01:18:52,276
Then I found out
that the guy we roughed up...

1170
01:18:52,444 --> 01:18:55,821
turned out to have a sister
working as a typist for the FBI.

1171
01:18:55,989 --> 01:18:58,782
Who could believe it?
Of all the fucking people.

1172
01:18:58,950 --> 01:19:02,244
She gave up everybody:
Jimmy, me, even her brother.

1173
01:19:03,621 --> 01:19:06,498
It took the jury six hours
to bring us in guilty.

1174
01:19:06,666 --> 01:19:09,918
The judge gave Jimmy and me 10 years
like he was giving away candy.

1175
01:19:10,086 --> 01:19:12,755
...ten years in a federal penitentiary.

1176
01:19:12,964 --> 01:19:17,051
You will now be turned over to the
United States Attorney General's Office.

1177
01:19:21,306 --> 01:19:22,931
Toast, guys.

1178
01:19:23,099 --> 01:19:25,434
Good trip, good life, get out soon.

1179
01:19:25,602 --> 01:19:27,478
Good trip, sweetheart.

1180
01:19:30,398 --> 01:19:32,483
We'll watch the home front.

1181
01:19:33,985 --> 01:19:36,445
Say hello to those blow-job hacks.

1182
01:19:37,489 --> 01:19:40,657
Yeah, motherfuck them
every chance you get.

1183
01:19:46,498 --> 01:19:49,041
I'll call you when I get a chance.

1184
01:20:01,429 --> 01:20:02,721
Now take me to jail.

1185
01:20:07,393 --> 01:20:10,187
In prison, dinner was always a big thing.

1186
01:20:10,522 --> 01:20:14,066
We had a pasta course,
and then we had a meat or a fish.

1187
01:20:14,609 --> 01:20:17,528
Paulie did the prep work.
He was doing a year for contempt...

1188
01:20:17,695 --> 01:20:20,030
and had this wonderful system
for doing the garlic.

1189
01:20:20,198 --> 01:20:23,200
He used a razor,
and he used to slice it so thin...

1190
01:20:23,368 --> 01:20:26,161
that it used to liquefy in the pan
with just a little oil.

1191
01:20:26,329 --> 01:20:28,288
It was a very good system.

1192
01:20:28,456 --> 01:20:30,958
Vinnie was in charge of the tomato sauce.

1193
01:20:31,126 --> 01:20:32,543
Get the smell?

1194
01:20:32,710 --> 01:20:35,420
Three kinds of meat in the meatballs:

1195
01:20:35,588 --> 01:20:37,631
Veal, beef, and pork.

1196
01:20:38,007 --> 01:20:40,092
Good, but you gotta have the pork.

1197
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:41,802
That's the flavor.

1198
01:20:41,970 --> 01:20:45,430
I felt he used too many onions,
but it was still a very good sauce.

1199
01:20:45,598 --> 01:20:48,392
Vinnie, don't put too many onions
in the sauce.

1200
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:51,145
I didn't put too much onions in, Paul.

1201
01:20:51,437 --> 01:20:53,230
Put three small onions, that's all I did.

1202
01:20:53,398 --> 01:20:55,941
Three onions? How many cans
of tomatoes you put in there?

1203
01:20:56,109 --> 01:20:58,861
- I put two big cans.
- You don't need three onions.

1204
01:20:59,028 --> 01:21:01,029
Johnny Dio did the meat.

1205
01:21:01,197 --> 01:21:03,782
We had no broiler,
so Johnny did everything in pans.

1206
01:21:03,950 --> 01:21:06,076
It used to smell up the joint
something awful...

1207
01:21:06,244 --> 01:21:09,204
and the hacks used to die,
but he still cooked a great steak.

1208
01:21:09,372 --> 01:21:11,915
- How do you like yours?
- Medium rare.

1209
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:14,626
Medium rare. An aristocrat.

1210
01:21:15,044 --> 01:21:18,797
You know, when you think of prison
you get pictures in your mind...

1211
01:21:18,965 --> 01:21:22,593
of all those old movies
with rows of guys behind bars.

1212
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:24,678
It wasn't like that for wiseguys.

1213
01:21:24,846 --> 01:21:27,514
It really wasn't that bad,
excepting that I missed Jimmy...

1214
01:21:27,682 --> 01:21:29,099
who was doing his time in Atlanta.

1215
01:21:29,267 --> 01:21:31,768
Give me two steaks
while you're in there, all right?

1216
01:21:33,104 --> 01:21:37,566
Everyone else in the joint was doing real
time, mixed together, living like pigs.

1217
01:21:37,734 --> 01:21:40,736
But we lived alone. We owned the joint.

1218
01:21:40,904 --> 01:21:44,281
We batted them sons of bitches.
You couldn't recognize them.

1219
01:21:44,449 --> 01:21:45,782
Good, they deserved it.

1220
01:21:45,950 --> 01:21:49,453
Even the hacks we couldn't bribe
would never rat on the guys we did.

1221
01:21:49,621 --> 01:21:51,413
...had respect. People loved one another.

1222
01:21:51,581 --> 01:21:53,749
- They left their doors open.
- Sorry it took so long.

1223
01:21:53,917 --> 01:21:56,418
The skinny guard's getting to be
a real pain in the ass.

1224
01:21:56,586 --> 01:21:59,796
- We're gonna have to do something.
- I took care of him.

1225
01:21:59,964 --> 01:22:01,673
What'd you bring?

1226
01:22:01,841 --> 01:22:03,342
- Bread.
- Good.

1227
01:22:03,635 --> 01:22:05,928
- Fresh.
- Vinnie, I got your peppers and onions.

1228
01:22:06,095 --> 01:22:08,388
Salami, prosciutto, a lot of cheese.

1229
01:22:08,556 --> 01:22:10,057
Come on, what else?

1230
01:22:10,225 --> 01:22:11,725
- Scotch.
- Nice.

1231
01:22:12,727 --> 01:22:14,561
- Some red wine.
- Okay.

1232
01:22:14,896 --> 01:22:16,772
- Now we can eat.
- I got some white, too.

1233
01:22:16,940 --> 01:22:18,690
Give me the white, too. Beautiful.

1234
01:22:18,858 --> 01:22:21,860
Okay, boys, let's eat.
Come on, it's ready, Vinnie.

1235
01:22:22,445 --> 01:22:23,528
Some more bread.

1236
01:22:23,696 --> 01:22:26,365
Tomorrow we eat sandwiches.
You got to go on a diet, Vinnie.

1237
01:22:26,532 --> 01:22:28,617
- You must be kidding.
- Believe me.

1238
01:22:37,877 --> 01:22:39,503
What are you doing?

1239
01:22:44,634 --> 01:22:46,510
I'll take that.

1240
01:22:48,888 --> 01:22:51,348
- All right, I'll catch you guys later.
- Yeah.

1241
01:22:51,516 --> 01:22:53,850
You going for a walk in the park?

1242
01:22:55,353 --> 01:22:58,522
- Okay, I'll catch you next week. Thanks.
- Okay.

1243
01:23:01,359 --> 01:23:03,902
- Is there any more?
- No, that's it. Have a good weekend.

1244
01:23:04,070 --> 01:23:05,070
- Thanks.
- You too, Henry.

1245
01:23:13,997 --> 01:23:15,122
Mrs. Hill, come here.

1246
01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:16,456
Come on.

1247
01:23:19,836 --> 01:23:21,878
You girls stay right here.

1248
01:23:22,297 --> 01:23:25,549
- I want you to hold hands.
- Okay, go right up to the front.

1249
01:23:25,883 --> 01:23:27,801
- Let's go.
- How you doing?

1250
01:23:27,969 --> 01:23:30,387
- Good, how are you?
- Very well, thank you.

1251
01:23:42,442 --> 01:23:45,027
- What you talking about?
- I saw her name in the register.

1252
01:23:45,194 --> 01:23:47,237
- Jesus Christ.
- You want her to visit you?

1253
01:23:47,405 --> 01:23:51,074
Let her stay up all night crying
and writing letters to the parole board.

1254
01:23:51,242 --> 01:23:54,411
What am I doing here?
Where am I? I'm in jail.

1255
01:23:54,579 --> 01:23:56,788
I can't stop people from coming to see me.

1256
01:23:56,956 --> 01:24:00,250
Good, let her sneak this stuff in
for you every week.

1257
01:24:00,418 --> 01:24:05,047
- Let her fight these bastards every week!
- Look what you're doing! Stop it!

1258
01:24:06,507 --> 01:24:07,758
I'm sorry.

1259
01:24:08,259 --> 01:24:10,719
Let her sneak this shit in for you.

1260
01:24:11,763 --> 01:24:13,597
Will you stop it, Karen?

1261
01:24:14,057 --> 01:24:16,600
- Let her do it!
- Stop it!

1262
01:24:24,776 --> 01:24:28,153
Nobody's helping me. I'm all alone.

1263
01:24:29,113 --> 01:24:31,114
Belle and Morrie are broke.

1264
01:24:31,532 --> 01:24:34,743
I asked your friend Remo
for the money that he owes you.

1265
01:24:34,911 --> 01:24:36,286
You know what he told me?

1266
01:24:36,454 --> 01:24:40,040
He told me to take my kids down
to the police station and get on welfare.

1267
01:24:40,208 --> 01:24:42,167
It's gonna be okay.

1268
01:24:42,377 --> 01:24:46,463
Even Paulie, since he got out, I've never
seen him. I never see anybody anymore.

1269
01:24:46,631 --> 01:24:49,424
It's only you and me.
That's what happens when you go away.

1270
01:24:49,592 --> 01:24:53,595
I told you that we're on our own.
Forget everybody else. Forget Paulie.

1271
01:24:54,597 --> 01:24:58,600
As long as he's on parole,
he doesn't want anybody doing anything.

1272
01:25:01,062 --> 01:25:03,313
- I can't do it.
- Yes, you can. Listen to me.

1273
01:25:03,481 --> 01:25:06,066
All I need is for you
is to keep bringing me the stuff.

1274
01:25:06,234 --> 01:25:08,819
I got a guy in here from Pittsburgh
who'll help me move it.

1275
01:25:08,986 --> 01:25:10,612
In a month we're gonna be fine.

1276
01:25:10,780 --> 01:25:13,198
- We won't need anybody.
- I'm afraid.

1277
01:25:13,366 --> 01:25:15,325
I'm afraid if Paulie finds out...

1278
01:25:15,493 --> 01:25:16,785
Don't worry about him.

1279
01:25:16,953 --> 01:25:20,497
He is not helping us out.
Is he putting any food on the table?

1280
01:25:21,666 --> 01:25:23,125
We've gotta help each other.

1281
01:25:23,292 --> 01:25:26,962
We've just gotta be really careful
while we do it.

1282
01:25:31,634 --> 01:25:33,844
I don't want to hear a word
about her anymore.

1283
01:25:34,011 --> 01:25:35,011
Never.

1284
01:26:00,413 --> 01:26:02,080
Daddy!

1285
01:26:03,708 --> 01:26:05,959
- We missed you.
- Are you here to stay?

1286
01:26:06,127 --> 01:26:09,713
Did you see our pictures?
I did the one with the house and rainbow.

1287
01:26:09,881 --> 01:26:11,298
I did the sun.

1288
01:26:11,466 --> 01:26:15,385
My chorus concert is in two weeks.
Are you coming?

1289
01:26:16,220 --> 01:26:18,054
Do you like the house?

1290
01:26:19,348 --> 01:26:21,391
Karen, get packed.
We're moving out of here.

1291
01:26:21,559 --> 01:26:22,601
With what?

1292
01:26:22,810 --> 01:26:25,896
Don't worry, with what.
Just start looking for a new house.

1293
01:26:26,063 --> 01:26:29,483
I got to go to Pittsburgh in the morning.
Those guys there owe me $15,000.

1294
01:26:29,650 --> 01:26:31,568
We'll be all right. I got things lined up.

1295
01:26:31,736 --> 01:26:34,404
Pittsburgh? You have to go see
your parole officer tomorrow.

1296
01:26:34,572 --> 01:26:37,491
Don't worry about it.
Everything's gonna be fine.

1297
01:26:38,201 --> 01:26:40,577
- Who wants to go to Uncle Paulie's?
- Me!

1298
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,464
What do you want?

1299
01:26:52,715 --> 01:26:54,758
Sweetheart, let Mommy eat.

1300
01:26:58,221 --> 01:27:01,097
You look good.
Did you eat this good in the joint?

1301
01:27:03,226 --> 01:27:05,101
I don't want any more of that shit.

1302
01:27:05,269 --> 01:27:06,269
What shit?

1303
01:27:06,437 --> 01:27:09,022
- Just stay away from the garbage.
- Look, Paulie...

1304
01:27:09,190 --> 01:27:12,400
I'm not talking about what you did inside.
You did what you had to do.

1305
01:27:12,568 --> 01:27:15,111
I'm talking about now. From now.
Here and now.

1306
01:27:16,155 --> 01:27:18,907
- Why would I get into that?
- Don't make a jerk out of me.

1307
01:27:19,075 --> 01:27:20,617
Just don't do it.

1308
01:27:24,372 --> 01:27:27,332
I want to talk to you about Jimmy.
You gotta watch out for him.

1309
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:30,252
He's a good earner, but he's wild,
takes too many chances.

1310
01:27:30,419 --> 01:27:32,879
I know Jimmy. You think
I would take chances like him?

1311
01:27:33,047 --> 01:27:34,798
Tommy's a good kid, but he's crazy.

1312
01:27:34,966 --> 01:27:36,716
He's a cowboy.
He's got too much to prove.

1313
01:27:36,884 --> 01:27:38,510
You gotta watch out for kids like this.

1314
01:27:38,678 --> 01:27:41,304
I know what they are.
I only use them for certain things.

1315
01:27:41,472 --> 01:27:43,974
I ain't gonna get fucked like Gribbs,
you understand?

1316
01:27:44,141 --> 01:27:48,478
Gribbs is 70 years old. The fucking guy's
gonna die in prison. I don't need that.

1317
01:27:48,813 --> 01:27:52,691
So I'm warning everybody. Everybody.
Could be my son, could be anybody.

1318
01:27:53,234 --> 01:27:55,777
Gribbs got 20 years just
for saying hello to some fuck...

1319
01:27:55,945 --> 01:27:58,029
who was sneaking behind his back,
selling junk.

1320
01:27:58,197 --> 01:28:00,657
I don't need that.
That won't happen to me, understand?

1321
01:28:00,825 --> 01:28:02,951
You know you're out early
because I got you a job.

1322
01:28:03,119 --> 01:28:05,120
I don't need this heat,
you understand that?

1323
01:28:05,288 --> 01:28:09,165
You see anybody fucking around
with this shit you're gonna tell me, right?

1324
01:28:09,333 --> 01:28:10,458
That means anybody.

1325
01:28:10,626 --> 01:28:11,626
- All right.
- Yeah?

1326
01:28:11,794 --> 01:28:13,295
Yeah. Of course.

1327
01:28:20,886 --> 01:28:24,848
Took me about a week of sneaking around
before I could unload the Pittsburgh stuff.

1328
01:28:25,016 --> 01:28:27,475
But when I did, it was a real score.

1329
01:28:27,643 --> 01:28:30,186
I started using Sandy's place
to mix the stuff.

1330
01:28:30,354 --> 01:28:32,772
And even with Sandy snorting
more than she mixed...

1331
01:28:32,940 --> 01:28:35,567
I could see that
this was a really good business.

1332
01:28:35,735 --> 01:28:38,153
I made $12,000 in my second week.

1333
01:28:38,738 --> 01:28:41,823
I had a down payment on my house
and things were really rolling.

1334
01:28:41,991 --> 01:28:46,202
All I had to do was every once in a while
tell Sandy that I loved her.

1335
01:28:49,832 --> 01:28:51,875
But it was perfect, I'm telling you.

1336
01:28:52,043 --> 01:28:54,419
As long as I kept getting
the stuff from Pittsburgh...

1337
01:28:54,587 --> 01:28:56,296
I knew Paulie would never find out.

1338
01:28:56,464 --> 01:29:00,383
Within a couple of weeks,
it got so big I needed some help.

1339
01:29:00,718 --> 01:29:03,511
So I got Jimmy and Tommy
to come in with me.

1340
01:29:03,888 --> 01:29:05,430
It's fucking great.

1341
01:29:05,681 --> 01:29:06,890
Mr. Conway.

1342
01:29:12,730 --> 01:29:14,648
- Bring your pay slips?
- Yeah.

1343
01:29:17,735 --> 01:29:20,070
Four and a half months of dirt.

1344
01:29:21,238 --> 01:29:23,198
- It's so good.
- I did it.

1345
01:29:24,367 --> 01:29:26,951
- Do you love it?
- It's wonderful.

1346
01:29:27,411 --> 01:29:31,164
And this we just had to have made special.
Go ahead, sit in it, Belle.

1347
01:29:31,332 --> 01:29:33,875
The others you couldn't even sit in.

1348
01:29:34,085 --> 01:29:35,585
Okay, you ready?

1349
01:29:35,753 --> 01:29:37,921
Watch the wall with the rock.

1350
01:29:45,554 --> 01:29:48,348
The electricians did it special. Come on.

1351
01:29:49,517 --> 01:29:51,267
Come on. All right.

1352
01:29:51,435 --> 01:29:55,063
This was imported. It came in two pieces.
Do you believe what they can do?

1353
01:29:55,231 --> 01:29:56,564
It's nice, huh?

1354
01:29:56,732 --> 01:29:58,775
Henry, come over here.
Did you and Jimmy talk?

1355
01:29:58,943 --> 01:30:01,403
I talked to him,
and he's looking into everything.

1356
01:30:01,570 --> 01:30:04,781
This'll make the Air France haul
look like goddamn peanuts.

1357
01:30:04,949 --> 01:30:07,200
- Come on.
- He's gonna do it, right?

1358
01:30:07,368 --> 01:30:09,119
I told you. He'll check everything out.

1359
01:30:09,286 --> 01:30:11,955
He's looking into it.
We'll see what happens. No promises.

1360
01:30:12,123 --> 01:30:16,292
I know. Do you understand?
There's millions in there. And I've been...

1361
01:30:16,460 --> 01:30:20,088
bleeding for this caper, been cultivating
this son of a bitch for two years.

1362
01:30:20,297 --> 01:30:23,341
He owes me $20,000. Once in a lifetime.
I could retire.

1363
01:30:23,509 --> 01:30:27,387
No more nut every week.
No more bullshit. My dream comes true.

1364
01:30:27,555 --> 01:30:29,639
Morrie, let's get a drink.

1365
01:30:30,307 --> 01:30:33,059
These are the guys that Jimmy
put together for what turned out to be...

1366
01:30:33,227 --> 01:30:37,105
the biggest heist in American history:
The Lufthansa heist.

1367
01:30:38,357 --> 01:30:41,067
Tommy and Carbone were gonna grab
the outside guard...

1368
01:30:41,235 --> 01:30:43,737
and make him get us in the front door.

1369
01:30:44,989 --> 01:30:48,283
Frenchy and Joe Buddha
had to round up the workers.

1370
01:30:48,826 --> 01:30:52,996
Johnny Roastbeef had to keep them
all tied up and away from the alarms.

1371
01:30:53,622 --> 01:30:55,832
Even Stacks Edwards got in on it.

1372
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,502
He used to hang around the lounge
and play guitar. Everybody loved Stacks.

1373
01:30:59,670 --> 01:31:02,130
What he was supposed to do
was steal the panel truck...

1374
01:31:02,298 --> 01:31:05,425
and afterwards compact it
by a friend of ours out in Jersey.

1375
01:31:05,593 --> 01:31:07,969
Only Morrie was driving us nuts.

1376
01:31:08,137 --> 01:31:10,138
Morrie, have a drink and shut up.

1377
01:31:10,306 --> 01:31:13,349
Just because he set this up,
he felt he could bust Jimmy's balls...

1378
01:31:13,517 --> 01:31:16,060
for an advance on the money
we were going to steal.

1379
01:31:16,228 --> 01:31:19,856
He didn't mean anything by it.
That's just the way he was.

1380
01:31:26,697 --> 01:31:30,825
I had everybody working for me.
Even our old baby-sitter, Lois Byrd.

1381
01:31:33,788 --> 01:31:35,205
Did you have a good flight?

1382
01:31:35,372 --> 01:31:37,874
I hate Pittsburgh.
Where did you find such creeps?

1383
01:31:38,083 --> 01:31:40,084
Come on, they're not that bad.

1384
01:31:41,212 --> 01:31:43,087
And it's worth it, isn't it?

1385
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:45,840
Is this the same baby you used last week?

1386
01:31:46,008 --> 01:31:49,093
No, that one was my sister's.
This is Deirdra's.

1387
01:31:50,054 --> 01:31:51,221
Big yawn.

1388
01:31:51,388 --> 01:31:53,139
She looks just like you.

1389
01:31:53,808 --> 01:31:56,142
That's what the stewardess said.

1390
01:32:08,781 --> 01:32:10,740
Take it easy, Sandy.

1391
01:32:10,908 --> 01:32:13,618
Come on, give me a break.
You got enough here to go around.

1392
01:32:13,786 --> 01:32:17,121
You got all day. Just make it last,
all right? Take it easy.

1393
01:32:17,581 --> 01:32:19,415
- I got to go.
- Where are you going?

1394
01:32:19,583 --> 01:32:23,670
Don't start. You know I gotta go
do this thing. Fuck, where are my keys?

1395
01:32:24,964 --> 01:32:26,339
Over there.

1396
01:32:26,507 --> 01:32:28,216
It's a mess. It's like a pig pen.

1397
01:32:28,384 --> 01:32:30,426
What do you think
I got you the dishwasher for?

1398
01:32:30,594 --> 01:32:32,387
I hate doing the dishes. Fucks up my nails.

1399
01:32:32,555 --> 01:32:34,264
How could you hate it?
You got to be smart.

1400
01:32:34,431 --> 01:32:37,600
Look at all this powder around here.
That could put us away forever.

1401
01:32:37,768 --> 01:32:39,978
- Loosen up.
- What are you doing?

1402
01:32:41,105 --> 01:32:44,440
- You know, I gotta...
- You don't have to go anywhere.

1403
01:32:45,609 --> 01:32:47,110
Make them wait.

1404
01:32:56,620 --> 01:33:00,164
Nobody knows for sure just how much
was taken in the daring pre-dawn raid...

1405
01:33:00,332 --> 01:33:02,959
at the Lufthansa cargo terminal
at Kennedy Airport.

1406
01:33:03,127 --> 01:33:06,838
The FBI says $2 million,
Port Authority Police say $4 million...

1407
01:33:10,175 --> 01:33:12,260
Jimmy!

1408
01:33:12,428 --> 01:33:14,262
Those sons of bitches!

1409
01:33:14,430 --> 01:33:16,764
...from the scene of the heist at JFK.

1410
01:33:16,932 --> 01:33:20,560
It looks like a big one. Maybe the biggest
this town has ever seen.

1411
01:33:22,479 --> 01:33:24,647
Come here, you! Come here!

1412
01:33:25,691 --> 01:33:28,401
Look at this genius. This genius!

1413
01:33:32,823 --> 01:33:34,490
Merry Christmas.

1414
01:33:39,246 --> 01:33:41,664
- Hello, who's this?
- That's my wife.

1415
01:33:42,625 --> 01:33:45,919
Come here.
I want to show you something, Jimmy.

1416
01:33:48,631 --> 01:33:50,006
Isn't she gorgeous?

1417
01:33:50,174 --> 01:33:53,343
I bought it for my wife.
It's a coupe. I love that car.

1418
01:33:56,180 --> 01:33:59,015
What did I tell you?
I talked to you before, didn't I?

1419
01:33:59,183 --> 01:34:00,516
Didn't I say what was going on?

1420
01:34:00,684 --> 01:34:02,769
Didn't I say not to go buy anything
for a while?

1421
01:34:02,937 --> 01:34:05,939
- The fucking car?
- It's a wedding gift from my mother.

1422
01:34:06,106 --> 01:34:08,232
It's under her name. I just got married.

1423
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:11,194
- I love that car.
- Excuse me, darling, for just a second.

1424
01:34:11,362 --> 01:34:13,655
- I just got married.
- Are you nuts?

1425
01:34:13,822 --> 01:34:16,449
- What are you getting excited for?
- Are you stupid?

1426
01:34:16,617 --> 01:34:19,118
We got a million bulls out there.
Everybody's watching us.

1427
01:34:19,286 --> 01:34:21,162
And you get a fucking car. I'm excited?

1428
01:34:21,330 --> 01:34:23,373
It's under my mother's name.
It's a wedding gift.

1429
01:34:23,540 --> 01:34:25,583
I don't give a fuck. Are you stupid?

1430
01:34:25,751 --> 01:34:27,710
Didn't you hear what I said?
Don't buy anything.

1431
01:34:27,878 --> 01:34:31,589
Don't get anything. Nothing big.
What's the matter with you?

1432
01:34:31,966 --> 01:34:33,341
What are you getting excited for?

1433
01:34:33,509 --> 01:34:36,886
Because you're going to get us all
fucking pinched. What are you, stupid?

1434
01:34:37,054 --> 01:34:39,764
- What's the matter with you?
- I apologize.

1435
01:34:41,225 --> 01:34:44,435
- I'm sorry.
- What the fuck is the matter with you?

1436
01:34:46,730 --> 01:34:48,064
I'm sorry.

1437
01:34:50,567 --> 01:34:54,070
I'm sorry, Jimmy.
It's under my mother's name.

1438
01:34:54,738 --> 01:34:57,407
What'd you say? You being
a fucking wise guy with me?

1439
01:34:57,574 --> 01:35:00,493
- I'm sorry. I apologize.
- What did I tell you?

1440
01:35:00,911 --> 01:35:03,913
What did I tell you?
You don't buy anything, you hear me?

1441
01:35:04,081 --> 01:35:05,707
Don't buy anything!

1442
01:35:05,874 --> 01:35:07,458
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

1443
01:35:10,713 --> 01:35:13,131
The fat fuck, he ought to wear a sign.

1444
01:35:20,597 --> 01:35:22,932
I can't believe this.
Are you stupid or what?

1445
01:35:23,100 --> 01:35:24,434
Excuse me.

1446
01:35:24,685 --> 01:35:26,352
- What's the matter?
- Take it off.

1447
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:29,480
- Why? What's the matter?
- Take it off!

1448
01:35:31,650 --> 01:35:35,194
Didn't I tell you not to get anything big
and not to attract attention?

1449
01:35:35,362 --> 01:35:38,448
In two days, one guy gets a Caddy
and one gets a $20,000 mink.

1450
01:35:38,615 --> 01:35:40,491
- Bring it fucking back.
- I'll bring it back.

1451
01:35:40,659 --> 01:35:44,162
I don't care what you do.
Bring it where you got it before.

1452
01:35:44,329 --> 01:35:47,081
- Get it out of here!
- All right. Let's go, honey.

1453
01:35:51,295 --> 01:35:53,463
Shut the fuck up and let's go.

1454
01:35:56,467 --> 01:35:59,052
This drink here is better than sex, babe.

1455
01:36:00,971 --> 01:36:05,141
I'm gonna go see Stacks. Don't you look
at anybody or I'll fucking kill you.

1456
01:36:05,309 --> 01:36:09,520
He's so jealous. If I even look
at anyone else, he'll kill me.

1457
01:36:09,772 --> 01:36:11,230
That's great.

1458
01:36:11,398 --> 01:36:14,484
Tell them all to relax.
Don't attract attention.

1459
01:36:17,529 --> 01:36:19,405
I've been looking all over for you.

1460
01:36:19,573 --> 01:36:21,157
How are you? Merry Christmas.

1461
01:36:21,325 --> 01:36:23,326
Listen, I need the money.

1462
01:36:23,744 --> 01:36:27,205
- Morrie, relax, okay? It's Christmas.
- Jimmy, I need the money.

1463
01:36:27,372 --> 01:36:29,540
I'm relaxing. I need the money.

1464
01:36:29,708 --> 01:36:32,627
- I did what I had to do. I need the money.
- Not tonight, Morrie.

1465
01:36:32,795 --> 01:36:36,881
Listen, I did my caper. He owes me.
Everybody's flashing their stuff.

1466
01:36:37,049 --> 01:36:39,717
Evidently, they got their money.
I'm wearing the same shit.

1467
01:36:39,885 --> 01:36:43,179
- Just not tonight.
- They're wearing it. I gotta talk to him.

1468
01:36:45,682 --> 01:36:48,226
I got $500,000 coming to me.

1469
01:36:48,393 --> 01:36:50,853
The biggest fucking bundle
he ever made in his life.

1470
01:36:51,021 --> 01:36:53,648
Morrie, I'll go talk to him.
Go have a drink, all right?

1471
01:36:53,816 --> 01:36:55,900
- I'll talk to him.
- It's poison in my eyes.

1472
01:36:56,068 --> 01:36:58,986
- Morris, baby, are you all right?
- No, I'm not.

1473
01:37:04,701 --> 01:37:08,079
Christmas. Your share. Just a little taste.

1474
01:37:11,291 --> 01:37:12,625
We did it!

1475
01:37:15,629 --> 01:37:17,338
- Jimmy.
- Yeah.

1476
01:37:17,965 --> 01:37:19,882
- Yeah, who is it?
- It's me.

1477
01:37:20,050 --> 01:37:21,676
Pete? One second.

1478
01:37:22,469 --> 01:37:25,096
Don't do what Frankie and Johnny did.
Don't be a moron with the money.

1479
01:37:25,264 --> 01:37:26,889
- Do what's right, understand?
- Yeah.

1480
01:37:28,934 --> 01:37:30,893
Karen, Judy, Ruth, come here!

1481
01:37:31,395 --> 01:37:34,147
I got the most expensive tree they had.

1482
01:37:35,566 --> 01:37:39,235
- What do you think, Mommy?
- I love them all.

1483
01:37:39,403 --> 01:37:41,028
I love the gold outfit.

1484
01:37:41,196 --> 01:37:42,905
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

1485
01:37:43,073 --> 01:37:44,448
- What?
- Merry Christmas.

1486
01:37:44,616 --> 01:37:45,908
And?

1487
01:37:46,326 --> 01:37:47,869
Happy Hanukkah.

1488
01:37:48,745 --> 01:37:51,998
- Very funny.
- Go get yourself something nice, okay?

1489
01:38:00,299 --> 01:38:04,677
Lufthansa should have been our ultimate
score. The heist of a lifetime.

1490
01:38:05,262 --> 01:38:08,514
$6 million in cash.
More than enough to go around.

1491
01:38:18,525 --> 01:38:19,942
Yo, Stacks!

1492
01:38:20,319 --> 01:38:22,945
Open up! What's up? What're you doing?

1493
01:38:29,244 --> 01:38:33,122
What's with you? He ain't ready.
I knew you wouldn't be ready.

1494
01:38:33,290 --> 01:38:36,542
- You didn't bring any coffee?
- What do I look like, a fucking caterer?

1495
01:38:36,710 --> 01:38:39,629
Frankie will make coffee.
Go ahead, Frankie, make coffee.

1496
01:38:42,674 --> 01:38:44,800
Thought you had
one of your bitches in here.

1497
01:38:44,968 --> 01:38:47,345
Yeah, I did. Where the fuck is she?

1498
01:38:48,347 --> 01:38:51,349
Always got these hot books around,
or a bitch, or something.

1499
01:38:51,516 --> 01:38:52,725
What time is it?

1500
01:38:52,893 --> 01:38:56,854
- It's 11:30. We had to be there by 9:00.
- I'll be ready in a minute.

1501
01:38:57,022 --> 01:39:00,900
You're always fucking late.
You'd be late for your own fucking funeral.

1502
01:39:05,864 --> 01:39:09,825
What the fuck you looking at?
Make that coffee to go. Let's go.

1503
01:39:12,955 --> 01:39:14,830
What the fuck you doing? It's a joke.

1504
01:39:14,998 --> 01:39:17,875
Put the fucking pot down.
You gonna take the coffee?

1505
01:39:37,688 --> 01:39:39,647
Stacks was always crazy.

1506
01:39:39,982 --> 01:39:43,651
Instead of getting rid of the truck
as he was supposed to, he got stoned...

1507
01:39:43,819 --> 01:39:48,364
went to his girlfriend's, and by the time
he woke up, the cops had found the truck.

1508
01:39:48,532 --> 01:39:50,616
It was all over the television.

1509
01:39:50,784 --> 01:39:53,786
They even said they came up
with prints off the wheel.

1510
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:57,957
It was just a matter of time
before they got to Stacks.

1511
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:11,512
I gotta talk to you.

1512
01:40:11,722 --> 01:40:14,348
- Have a drink.
- Have a drink. Come on.

1513
01:40:14,850 --> 01:40:18,644
Have a drink. What you doing?
It's an occasion. Have a drink.

1514
01:40:19,938 --> 01:40:22,023
I still gotta talk to you.

1515
01:40:22,357 --> 01:40:23,357
What?

1516
01:40:23,525 --> 01:40:26,027
- What happened with Stacks?
- Don't worry about that.

1517
01:40:26,194 --> 01:40:29,947
- There's feds all over the place.
- So what? Where are they gonna go?

1518
01:40:30,490 --> 01:40:33,034
- It's in the papers.
- He's worried.

1519
01:40:33,535 --> 01:40:34,744
What are you worried about?

1520
01:40:35,412 --> 01:40:38,873
The television and the newspapers.
All the shit's out there.

1521
01:40:39,041 --> 01:40:42,251
- What are you worried about?
- You worry too much.

1522
01:40:42,711 --> 01:40:45,212
Everything is beautiful.
There's nothing to worry about.

1523
01:40:45,380 --> 01:40:47,757
- Didn't you tell him?
- I didn't tell him yet.

1524
01:40:47,924 --> 01:40:49,383
- What?
- Guess what?

1525
01:40:50,927 --> 01:40:52,595
They're gonna make him.

1526
01:40:54,264 --> 01:40:56,223
Paulie's going to make you?

1527
01:40:57,017 --> 01:40:58,142
Tommy.

1528
01:40:58,310 --> 01:41:00,811
They opened up the books.
Paulie got the okay.

1529
01:41:01,021 --> 01:41:03,773
You believe that?
This little guinea bastard.

1530
01:41:04,691 --> 01:41:09,111
He's gonna get made. We're gonna work
for this guy one day. He's gonna be a boss.

1531
01:41:10,197 --> 01:41:11,781
I can't believe it.

1532
01:41:11,948 --> 01:41:14,116
I'm really happy for you.
Great. Congratulations.

1533
01:41:14,284 --> 01:41:16,285
Motherfuckers, we got them now.

1534
01:41:17,079 --> 01:41:21,332
Jimmy, I've been looking all over for you.
Can I talk to you a second?

1535
01:41:22,125 --> 01:41:24,460
I mastermind the goddamn thing,
I'm left with dick.

1536
01:41:24,628 --> 01:41:28,005
They'd be up a creek if not for me.
Fuck him! I want my money.

1537
01:41:28,340 --> 01:41:30,466
I want my money! I've had it up to here!

1538
01:41:30,634 --> 01:41:32,968
That cheap cigarette hijacker.

1539
01:41:33,136 --> 01:41:35,930
- Fuck him! I want my money!
- Good. Go tell him.

1540
01:41:38,642 --> 01:41:41,477
You're gonna keep your mouth shut,
or what?

1541
01:41:43,105 --> 01:41:44,980
Morrie, you're gonna get your money.

1542
01:41:45,148 --> 01:41:47,608
You just got to stop busting balls.

1543
01:41:47,984 --> 01:41:50,820
All right? Look at me. You hear me?
Look at me, okay?

1544
01:41:51,029 --> 01:41:53,239
Everything's going to be fine.

1545
01:41:59,329 --> 01:42:00,371
Henry.

1546
01:42:06,002 --> 01:42:09,505
Sweetheart, half mick, half guinea?
I'll sing with an Italian accent.

1547
01:42:51,882 --> 01:42:55,134
I could see for the first time
that Jimmy was a nervous wreck.

1548
01:42:55,302 --> 01:42:58,471
His mind was going in
eight different directions at once.

1549
01:43:00,765 --> 01:43:03,225
Think Morrie tells his wife everything?

1550
01:43:03,518 --> 01:43:04,894
Morrie? Him?

1551
01:43:05,479 --> 01:43:08,355
That's when I knew
Jimmy was going to whack Morrie.

1552
01:43:08,523 --> 01:43:12,860
That's how it happens. That's how fast
it takes for a guy to get whacked.

1553
01:43:13,528 --> 01:43:15,905
He's a nut job. He talks to everybody.

1554
01:43:16,072 --> 01:43:19,575
Acts like a jerk in his commercials.
Nobody listens to what he says.

1555
01:43:19,743 --> 01:43:22,912
Nobody fucking cares what he says,
he talks so much.

1556
01:43:23,121 --> 01:43:25,748
Make sure you bring him here tonight.

1557
01:43:25,916 --> 01:43:27,541
- Okay?
- All right.

1558
01:43:29,961 --> 01:43:32,838
Start like this. Sorry.
Did I get you in the eye?

1559
01:43:33,006 --> 01:43:34,965
Stop breaking my balls, all right?

1560
01:43:35,133 --> 01:43:37,009
I was just stalling for time.

1561
01:43:37,761 --> 01:43:41,847
I knew I still had till 8:00 or 9:00
to talk Jimmy out of killing Morrie.

1562
01:43:42,057 --> 01:43:46,101
But meanwhile, as far as Jimmy knew,
I was going along with the program.

1563
01:43:46,269 --> 01:43:50,022
I pulled his hair out of his fucking head.
I bit him. He's out cold.

1564
01:43:52,108 --> 01:43:54,401
I'm enraged.
I wanted to kill this little fuck.

1565
01:43:54,569 --> 01:43:57,488
I walk away.
We start to go in the fucking joint.

1566
01:43:57,864 --> 01:44:00,699
I don't want to turn around.
Jimmy's going like this to me.

1567
01:44:01,618 --> 01:44:03,410
I don't want to fucking turn around.

1568
01:44:03,578 --> 01:44:06,997
I don't want to turn around. He picks up
his fucking head, he says...

1569
01:44:08,458 --> 01:44:10,292
I said, "Don't say it."

1570
01:44:15,215 --> 01:44:16,549
"Jerkoff!"

1571
01:44:19,302 --> 01:44:22,805
What are you going to do? What?
I fucking fly at him.

1572
01:44:22,973 --> 01:44:25,975
I got him and I'm banging his head,
banging his fucking face.

1573
01:44:26,142 --> 01:44:27,851
I'm pulling his hair out of his head.

1574
01:44:28,019 --> 01:44:31,021
I beat him to a pulp. To a pulp I beat him.

1575
01:44:31,189 --> 01:44:34,149
He's laying there full of fucking blood.
I'm out of breath.

1576
01:44:34,317 --> 01:44:36,902
Forget about tonight. Forget about it.

1577
01:44:37,737 --> 01:44:39,780
It was a load off my mind.

1578
01:44:40,865 --> 01:44:42,074
Poor bastard.

1579
01:44:42,242 --> 01:44:44,493
He never knew how close he'd come
to getting killed.

1580
01:44:44,661 --> 01:44:47,580
Even if I told him,
he would have never believed me.

1581
01:44:49,332 --> 01:44:53,335
- Jimmy, could I talk to you now?
- You're a pisser. A real pisser.

1582
01:44:53,962 --> 01:44:57,172
Want to talk now? Okay, let's talk.
Let's get it over with.

1583
01:44:57,340 --> 01:45:00,342
I've never met a ball buster like you,
my whole life.

1584
01:45:00,510 --> 01:45:02,511
Who loves you more than I do?

1585
01:45:02,679 --> 01:45:06,015
- I'd do anything for you.
- Except to stop busting my balls.

1586
01:45:06,933 --> 01:45:09,351
- Let's go have coffee.
- Want to go to the diner?

1587
01:45:09,519 --> 01:45:11,770
We'll go to the diner on the boulevard.

1588
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:15,399
- Which diner?
- Rockaway Boulevard. It's open 24 hours.

1589
01:45:15,567 --> 01:45:17,693
- They got Danishes?
- They got everything.

1590
01:45:17,861 --> 01:45:20,154
Let's pick up some Danishes for Belle.

1591
01:45:20,697 --> 01:45:25,492
Hear about the points we were shaving
up in Boston? It's terrific. Nunzio...

1592
01:45:33,209 --> 01:45:34,710
I thought he'd never shut up.

1593
01:45:34,878 --> 01:45:36,587
What a pain in the ass.

1594
01:45:36,755 --> 01:45:39,548
- What'll we do with him?
- Chop him up and get rid of the car.

1595
01:45:39,716 --> 01:45:41,675
Call me when you're through.

1596
01:45:41,843 --> 01:45:44,261
- Frank, let's chop him up.
- All right.

1597
01:45:44,429 --> 01:45:46,972
Where you going,
you dizzy motherfucker, you?

1598
01:45:47,140 --> 01:45:48,182
You said chop him up.

1599
01:45:48,350 --> 01:45:51,685
At Charlie's, not here!
Where are you gonna chop him here?

1600
01:45:52,687 --> 01:45:55,314
Come on, what are you doing?
Get out of here.

1601
01:45:55,482 --> 01:45:57,566
I got a better shot letting him drive.

1602
01:45:57,734 --> 01:45:59,485
The car's cold.

1603
01:45:59,653 --> 01:46:03,238
Get the fuck out of here!
What, warm it up? Get out of here!

1604
01:46:04,074 --> 01:46:06,533
- Who is it?
- It's Belle. Open up.

1605
01:46:06,701 --> 01:46:08,410
It's Belle. Let me in.

1606
01:46:09,245 --> 01:46:13,082
Morris didn't come home. He's missing.
I know something's happened.

1607
01:46:13,249 --> 01:46:14,583
Calm down.

1608
01:46:14,876 --> 01:46:17,294
He's missing! I know something happened.

1609
01:46:17,462 --> 01:46:19,672
He's probably drunk
and fell asleep somewhere.

1610
01:46:19,839 --> 01:46:23,509
In 27 years, he's never been away all night
without calling.

1611
01:46:23,677 --> 01:46:26,428
I know something's happened.
I know you know.

1612
01:46:26,596 --> 01:46:30,265
Let me get changed.
I'll take you home, then look for him.

1613
01:46:30,642 --> 01:46:33,936
- I've been home! I've been on the phone...
- He's playing cards.

1614
01:46:37,107 --> 01:46:39,608
- What'll I tell Belle?
- Who gives a fuck?

1615
01:46:40,485 --> 01:46:43,946
Tell her he ran off with some broad.
What do you care?

1616
01:46:44,114 --> 01:46:46,156
- Watch this.
- Don't fuck with them.

1617
01:46:46,324 --> 01:46:48,283
I do it all the time.
I'll bust their balls.

1618
01:46:48,451 --> 01:46:51,286
Don't give them the satisfaction,
the fucks.

1619
01:46:53,790 --> 01:46:56,125
Come on, fuckos. Let's go for a ride.

1620
01:46:57,419 --> 01:46:59,128
Keep them up all night.

1621
01:47:00,046 --> 01:47:01,630
I'll see you later.

1622
01:47:51,306 --> 01:47:54,475
Jimmy was cutting every link
between himself and the robbery...

1623
01:47:54,642 --> 01:47:57,019
but it had nothing to do with me.

1624
01:48:07,530 --> 01:48:10,866
I gave Jimmy the tip and he gave me
some Christmas money.

1625
01:48:12,619 --> 01:48:14,995
From then on, I kept my mouth shut.

1626
01:48:15,163 --> 01:48:19,041
I knew Jimmy. He had the cash. It was his.

1627
01:48:19,209 --> 01:48:22,544
He kicked some money upstairs to Paulie,
but that was it.

1628
01:48:23,630 --> 01:48:27,090
It made him sick to turn the money over
to the guys who stole it.

1629
01:48:27,258 --> 01:48:30,093
He'd rather whack them.
Anyway, what did I care?

1630
01:48:30,261 --> 01:48:32,095
I wasn't asking for anything.

1631
01:48:32,263 --> 01:48:35,891
And Jimmy was making nice money
through my Pittsburgh connections.

1632
01:48:36,434 --> 01:48:40,521
Still, months after the robbery
they were finding bodies all over.

1633
01:49:02,544 --> 01:49:05,254
When they found Carbone
in the meat truck...

1634
01:49:05,421 --> 01:49:07,089
he was frozen so stiff...

1635
01:49:07,257 --> 01:49:10,384
it took them two days
to thaw him out for the autopsy.

1636
01:49:15,223 --> 01:49:17,349
Still, I never saw Jimmy so happy.

1637
01:49:17,767 --> 01:49:21,353
He was like a kid. We had money
coming in through my Pittsburgh people...

1638
01:49:21,521 --> 01:49:25,065
and even after a while,
the Lufthansa thing began to calm down.

1639
01:49:25,233 --> 01:49:27,401
What made Jimmy so happy
that morning...

1640
01:49:27,569 --> 01:49:30,445
was that this was the day
that Tommy was being made.

1641
01:49:30,947 --> 01:49:33,949
Jimmy was so excited,
you'd think he was being made.

1642
01:49:34,576 --> 01:49:37,202
He must have made four calls
to Tommy's house.

1643
01:49:37,412 --> 01:49:41,331
They had a signal set up, so he'd know
the minute the ceremony was over.

1644
01:49:42,208 --> 01:49:44,459
- Ma, where are you?
- Here I am.

1645
01:49:45,086 --> 01:49:47,629
- You're home.
- Home? I'm leaving.

1646
01:49:48,089 --> 01:49:50,632
- You look lovely.
- I look good, huh?

1647
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:54,177
You look wonderful. Be careful.
Congratulations.

1648
01:49:54,846 --> 01:49:58,181
I love you. Don't paint
any more religious pictures, please.

1649
01:49:58,349 --> 01:49:59,975
- God be with you.
- Bye, Ma.

1650
01:50:00,143 --> 01:50:02,477
We always called each other goodfellas.

1651
01:50:02,645 --> 01:50:04,271
You'd say to somebody:

1652
01:50:04,439 --> 01:50:08,650
"You'll like this guy. He's all right.
He's a goodfella, one of us."

1653
01:50:08,985 --> 01:50:10,360
You understand?

1654
01:50:11,029 --> 01:50:13,363
We were goodfellas. Wiseguys.

1655
01:50:15,825 --> 01:50:19,202
But Jimmy and I could never be made
because we had Irish blood.

1656
01:50:19,370 --> 01:50:21,830
It didn't matter my mother was Sicilian.

1657
01:50:22,081 --> 01:50:26,001
To become a member of a crew,
you've got to be 100% ltalian...

1658
01:50:26,169 --> 01:50:29,379
so they can trace your relatives
back to the old country.

1659
01:50:36,512 --> 01:50:38,847
It's the highest honor they can give you.

1660
01:50:39,015 --> 01:50:41,516
It means you belong
to a family and a crew.

1661
01:50:41,893 --> 01:50:44,436
It means nobody can fuck around
with you.

1662
01:50:44,979 --> 01:50:47,356
It also means you could
fuck around with anybody...

1663
01:50:47,523 --> 01:50:49,983
just as long as they aren't also a member.

1664
01:50:50,151 --> 01:50:53,570
It's like a license to steal.
A license to do anything.

1665
01:50:55,740 --> 01:50:57,741
How many years ago
since you were made?

1666
01:50:57,909 --> 01:51:00,661
- I'm an old-timer. 30 years ago.
- Thirty years?

1667
01:51:00,828 --> 01:51:05,082
Brings back a lot of memories.
Pike's Peak was a pimple then, wasn't it?

1668
01:51:08,378 --> 01:51:11,338
As far as Jimmy was concerned,
with Tommy being made...

1669
01:51:11,506 --> 01:51:13,882
it was like we were all being made.

1670
01:51:14,759 --> 01:51:17,302
We would now have
one of our own as a member.

1671
01:51:33,277 --> 01:51:34,903
- Who's this?
- This is Vinnie.

1672
01:51:35,071 --> 01:51:37,906
Vinnie. What happened?
Did we get straightened out?

1673
01:51:38,074 --> 01:51:41,076
No, we had a problem.
We tried to do everything we could.

1674
01:51:41,244 --> 01:51:42,244
What do you mean?

1675
01:51:42,412 --> 01:51:46,581
You know what I mean. He's gone,
and we couldn't do nothing about it.

1676
01:51:48,459 --> 01:51:50,335
- That's it.
- What do you mean?

1677
01:51:50,503 --> 01:51:51,878
He's gone.

1678
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:54,881
That's it.

1679
01:51:59,762 --> 01:52:02,597
I knew it! I can't fucking believe it.

1680
01:52:12,984 --> 01:52:15,110
- What happened?
- They fucking whacked him.

1681
01:52:15,278 --> 01:52:16,445
Fuck.

1682
01:52:32,295 --> 01:52:33,962
Are you all right?

1683
01:52:41,012 --> 01:52:43,513
It was revenge for Billy Batts...

1684
01:52:43,681 --> 01:52:45,474
and a lot of other things.

1685
01:52:45,641 --> 01:52:46,641
And that's that.

1686
01:52:46,809 --> 01:52:49,311
There was nothing we could do about it.

1687
01:52:49,479 --> 01:52:52,105
Batts was a made man
and Tommy wasn't.

1688
01:52:52,690 --> 01:52:54,649
We had to sit still and take it.

1689
01:52:54,817 --> 01:52:58,236
It was among the ltalians.
It was real greaseball shit.

1690
01:53:10,875 --> 01:53:12,709
They even shot Tommy in the face...

1691
01:53:12,877 --> 01:53:16,338
so his mother couldn't give him
an open coffin at the funeral.

1692
01:54:03,845 --> 01:54:07,139
I was gonna be busy all day.
I had to drop off some guns at Jimmy's...

1693
01:54:07,306 --> 01:54:09,057
to match some silencers he had.

1694
01:54:09,225 --> 01:54:12,227
I had to pick up my brother at the hospital
and drive him home.

1695
01:54:12,395 --> 01:54:14,896
I had to pick up
some new Pittsburgh stuff for Lois...

1696
01:54:15,064 --> 01:54:18,233
to fly down to some customers
I had near Atlanta.

1697
01:54:29,537 --> 01:54:32,998
Right away, I knew he didn't want them,
and I'd be stuck for the money.

1698
01:54:33,166 --> 01:54:36,877
I only bought them because
he wanted them, and now he didn't.

1699
01:54:37,587 --> 01:54:41,089
What good are these? None of them fit.
What's the matter with you?

1700
01:54:41,257 --> 01:54:42,591
I'm not paying for it.

1701
01:54:42,758 --> 01:54:46,428
I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was
so pissed off, he didn't even say goodbye.

1702
01:54:46,596 --> 01:54:48,763
Stop the drugs. They're making
your mind into mush!

1703
01:54:48,931 --> 01:54:50,348
- You hear me?
- I'll take them back.

1704
01:55:03,988 --> 01:55:05,947
My Pittsburgh guys always wanted guns.

1705
01:55:06,115 --> 01:55:09,701
Since I would see them in the afternoon
to pick up a delivery...

1706
01:55:09,869 --> 01:55:12,454
I was pretty sure I'd get my money back.

1707
01:55:31,474 --> 01:55:32,474
Oh, my God.

1708
01:55:34,310 --> 01:55:38,355
When I finally got to the hospital,
Michael's doctor wanted to put me in bed.

1709
01:55:38,522 --> 01:55:40,649
Jesus Christ, what happened to you?

1710
01:55:41,692 --> 01:55:44,069
I almost got into an accident
on the way here.

1711
01:55:44,237 --> 01:55:47,155
And I told him I was partying all night.

1712
01:55:47,323 --> 01:55:49,115
- I'm fine.
- Come on. Get over here.

1713
01:55:49,283 --> 01:55:51,368
- Doc, I'm fine.
- Let me check you out.

1714
01:55:51,869 --> 01:55:53,036
Come on.

1715
01:55:56,082 --> 01:55:58,750
He took mercy on me,
gave me 10 milligrams of Valium...

1716
01:55:58,918 --> 01:56:00,001
and sent me home.

1717
01:56:00,711 --> 01:56:04,464
My plan was to drop off my brother
at the house and pick up Karen.

1718
01:56:06,509 --> 01:56:09,719
There it is.
You see that helicopter right there?

1719
01:56:09,887 --> 01:56:13,223
Right in front of us, there.
I think it's been following me all morning.

1720
01:56:13,391 --> 01:56:16,226
- Get the fuck out. What are you, nuts?
- I'm telling you.

1721
01:56:16,394 --> 01:56:17,602
I don't know what's going on.

1722
01:56:17,770 --> 01:56:20,814
It's the third time I've seen it.
At the hospital I saw it.

1723
01:56:20,982 --> 01:56:23,358
I had to make some stops.
I've seen it every time.

1724
01:56:23,526 --> 01:56:25,944
I've been all over town
and I've seen it all day.

1725
01:56:32,910 --> 01:56:34,536
I was cooking dinner that night.

1726
01:56:35,663 --> 01:56:39,332
I had to start braising the beef
and veal shanks for the tomato sauce.

1727
01:56:42,003 --> 01:56:45,213
It was Michael's favorite.
I was making ziti with meat gravy...

1728
01:56:45,381 --> 01:56:47,882
and I'm planning to roast some peppers
over the flames...

1729
01:56:48,050 --> 01:56:52,012
put on some string beans with olive oil.
I had some beautiful cutlets...

1730
01:56:52,179 --> 01:56:53,221
that were cut just right...

1731
01:56:53,389 --> 01:56:56,391
that I was going to fry up as an appetizer.

1732
01:56:56,600 --> 01:56:58,560
So, I was home for about an hour.

1733
01:56:58,769 --> 01:57:00,729
My plan was to start the dinner early...

1734
01:57:00,896 --> 01:57:03,440
so Karen and I could unload the guns
Jimmy didn't want...

1735
01:57:03,607 --> 01:57:05,025
then get the package for Lois...

1736
01:57:05,192 --> 01:57:07,736
to take to Atlanta for her trip
later that night.

1737
01:57:08,612 --> 01:57:12,407
I kept looking out the window,
and I saw that the helicopter was gone.

1738
01:57:13,034 --> 01:57:16,536
Michael, keep an eye on the sauce.
Stay here with your Uncle Michael.

1739
01:57:17,663 --> 01:57:21,416
So I asked my brother to watch the sauce,
and Karen and I started out.

1740
01:57:24,337 --> 01:57:26,421
Oh, God. I see it.

1741
01:57:26,672 --> 01:57:29,174
- I see it. Look, it's right there.
- Damn!

1742
01:57:30,384 --> 01:57:31,801
- That's it.
- There it is.

1743
01:57:31,969 --> 01:57:33,595
We got to get to your mother's.

1744
01:57:34,221 --> 01:57:35,472
See, I told you.

1745
01:57:35,681 --> 01:57:37,057
It's funny.

1746
01:57:37,433 --> 01:57:40,435
- It's not the end of the world.
- We're going to your mother's.

1747
01:58:08,964 --> 01:58:12,675
Go inside, tell your mother not to touch
anything outside the house. Nothing.

1748
01:58:12,843 --> 01:58:15,595
We couldn't go to your mother's house?
You had to come here.

1749
01:58:21,143 --> 01:58:22,811
Let's go shopping.

1750
01:58:25,064 --> 01:58:27,190
I'm not nuts,
it's been following me all morning.

1751
01:58:28,359 --> 01:58:29,484
I'm telling you.

1752
01:58:30,486 --> 01:58:33,738
Fine. Fine. He thinks I'm paranoid!

1753
01:58:34,824 --> 01:58:38,201
I should bring him the helicopter,
then we'll see how paranoid I am.

1754
01:58:40,204 --> 01:58:42,080
Come on, let's go inside.

1755
01:58:46,168 --> 01:58:48,128
- Yeah, it's gone.
- I don't hear anything.

1756
01:58:48,295 --> 01:58:49,587
Let's go back to your mother's.

1757
01:59:03,477 --> 01:59:06,020
- They all right?
- Beautiful. They're great.

1758
01:59:06,856 --> 01:59:09,524
Didn't I tell you, you were paranoid?
Didn't I tell him?

1759
01:59:09,692 --> 01:59:11,192
Yeah. I need a hit.

1760
01:59:11,777 --> 01:59:14,779
Want to see helicopters?
Come on, I'll show you helicopters.

1761
01:59:15,406 --> 01:59:17,866
I've seen enough helicopters for one day,
thank you.

1762
01:59:18,909 --> 01:59:23,246
I had to get home and get the package
ready for Lois to take on her trip.

1763
01:59:23,414 --> 01:59:27,292
Also, I had to get to Sandy's to give
the package a whack with quinine.

1764
01:59:27,626 --> 01:59:29,878
Plus, I knew Sandy would get on my ass.

1765
01:59:30,045 --> 01:59:33,756
I had the cooking to finish,
and I had to get Lois ready for her trip.

1766
01:59:33,924 --> 01:59:36,468
- It's Sandy. What is this?
- She's a pain in the ass.

1767
01:59:38,220 --> 01:59:39,888
- When are you coming over?
- In an hour.

1768
01:59:40,055 --> 01:59:43,057
- You staying tonight, right?
- I can't. I got my brother tonight.

1769
01:59:43,392 --> 01:59:47,479
Come on, stop.
We'll talk about it later, okay? Goodbye.

1770
01:59:55,112 --> 01:59:57,113
- Hello?
- It's me. You ready?

1771
01:59:58,115 --> 02:00:00,950
Tell Michael not to let the sauce stick.
Keep stirring it.

1772
02:00:01,535 --> 02:00:05,371
- Henry says don't let the sauce stick.
- I'm stirring it.

1773
02:00:05,539 --> 02:00:07,373
- Listen, you know what to do?
- Yeah, yeah.

1774
02:00:07,541 --> 02:00:09,751
Don't "yeah, yeah" me, Lois.
This is important.

1775
02:00:09,919 --> 02:00:12,378
Make sure you leave the house
when you make the call.

1776
02:00:12,546 --> 02:00:15,715
Understand me?
Call from an outside line. I mean it.

1777
02:00:15,883 --> 02:00:19,552
Jesus, you must think I'm dumb. Why
are you bugging me? I know what to do.

1778
02:00:19,720 --> 02:00:22,263
You little hick, just make sure you do it.

1779
02:00:22,431 --> 02:00:23,473
You can be such a pain.

1780
02:00:23,641 --> 02:00:27,769
- Hey! Just do it!
- Okay.

1781
02:00:28,354 --> 02:00:32,899
Un-fucking-believable. All of them.
Every fucking girl in my life.

1782
02:00:34,235 --> 02:00:36,361
- What did he say?
- Nothing.

1783
02:00:36,529 --> 02:00:38,821
What does she do
after she hangs up with me?

1784
02:00:38,989 --> 02:00:42,492
After everything I told her?
After all her "yeah, yeah" bullshit?

1785
02:00:42,660 --> 02:00:45,286
She picks up the phone
and calls from the house.

1786
02:00:45,454 --> 02:00:47,789
If anybody was listening,
they'd know everything.

1787
02:00:47,957 --> 02:00:49,874
They'd know a package
was leaving my house...

1788
02:00:50,042 --> 02:00:53,294
and they'd even have the time and
flight number, thanks to her.

1789
02:00:54,463 --> 02:00:57,131
As soon as I got home, I started cooking.

1790
02:00:57,299 --> 02:00:59,384
I had a few hours until Lois' flight.

1791
02:00:59,552 --> 02:01:01,636
I told my brother to watch the stove.

1792
02:01:01,804 --> 02:01:04,931
All day long the guy's been watching
helicopters and tomato sauce.

1793
02:01:06,392 --> 02:01:11,020
I had to drive over to Sandy's,
mix the stuff, then get back to the gravy.

1794
02:01:22,199 --> 02:01:25,034
Do you think you can come over here,
fuck me, and leave?

1795
02:01:25,411 --> 02:01:27,495
- Come on.
- You got someplace better to go?

1796
02:01:27,663 --> 02:01:30,164
Don't talk like that. Come on.

1797
02:01:30,499 --> 02:01:32,333
- You all right?
- Yeah, sure.

1798
02:01:32,501 --> 02:01:33,501
You believe me?

1799
02:01:34,920 --> 02:01:37,714
Do you believe me?

1800
02:01:40,050 --> 02:01:41,551
- That the last one?
- Yeah.

1801
02:01:51,395 --> 02:01:53,354
You lying son of a bitch. I hate you!

1802
02:02:00,446 --> 02:02:04,240
Please stop feeding the dog
from the table...

1803
02:02:04,408 --> 02:02:06,701
from the plate on top of it. Stop it.

1804
02:02:06,869 --> 02:02:09,203
- I have to.
- You don't have to.

1805
02:02:14,168 --> 02:02:15,627
I got to go home.

1806
02:02:17,671 --> 02:02:19,589
What do you mean, you got to go home?

1807
02:02:19,757 --> 02:02:21,049
I've been carrying this all day.

1808
02:02:21,216 --> 02:02:23,843
We got to start taping it to your leg.
We got to go soon.

1809
02:02:24,011 --> 02:02:25,928
I got to go home and get my hat.

1810
02:02:26,847 --> 02:02:29,057
Forget your fucking hat.
Are you kidding me?

1811
02:02:29,642 --> 02:02:32,393
So I need a trip to Rockaway
because you want your hat?

1812
02:02:32,561 --> 02:02:36,439
I need it, I got to have it.
It's my lucky hat. I never fly without it.

1813
02:02:36,732 --> 02:02:40,735
Lois, do you understand
what we are involved in here?

1814
02:02:41,195 --> 02:02:44,238
I don't care. I need my hat.
I won't fly without it.

1815
02:02:49,161 --> 02:02:52,955
What could I do if she insisted
I drive her home for her goddamn hat?

1816
02:02:53,123 --> 02:02:55,708
I hid the package in the kitchen
and went to take her home.

1817
02:02:55,876 --> 02:02:56,876
A hat?

1818
02:03:06,011 --> 02:03:07,387
What the fuck is this?

1819
02:03:07,805 --> 02:03:10,348
Police! Freeze! Don't you move,
you motherfucker...

1820
02:03:10,516 --> 02:03:13,559
or I'll blow your brains out.
Shut the car off slowly.

1821
02:03:17,564 --> 02:03:19,732
For a second, I thought I was dead.

1822
02:03:19,900 --> 02:03:22,235
But when I heard all the noise,
I knew they were cops.

1823
02:03:22,403 --> 02:03:23,945
Only cops talk that way.

1824
02:03:24,279 --> 02:03:25,446
Don't fucking move.

1825
02:03:25,614 --> 02:03:29,117
If they had been wiseguys,
I wouldn't have heard a thing.

1826
02:03:29,993 --> 02:03:31,619
I would have been dead.

1827
02:03:32,621 --> 02:03:34,080
Michael, lock the door!

1828
02:03:58,605 --> 02:04:01,274
Talk to me. When was the last time
you took a collar?

1829
02:04:01,692 --> 02:04:03,317
Fuckhead, I'm talking to you.

1830
02:04:03,485 --> 02:04:07,155
You don't want to say a fucking word,
don't. I don't really give a fuck.

1831
02:04:07,322 --> 02:04:11,409
You'll do 25 years. See how much
of a good guy you'll be then.

1832
02:04:11,577 --> 02:04:13,619
All day I thought the guys
in the helicopter...

1833
02:04:13,787 --> 02:04:18,374
were local cops busting my balls over
Lufthansa. They turned out to be narcs.

1834
02:04:18,542 --> 02:04:19,542
Just get the lawyer.

1835
02:04:19,710 --> 02:04:23,296
They'd been on me a month.
Phone taps, surveillance, everything.

1836
02:04:23,464 --> 02:04:26,132
You know the boys. All the pals are here.

1837
02:04:26,300 --> 02:04:29,218
You don't want to talk to me,
you'll have a problem all night.

1838
02:04:30,053 --> 02:04:33,931
Each one of these counts holds
25-to-life in New York State.

1839
02:04:34,099 --> 02:04:38,686
Twenty-five fucking years, pal.
I'll slap your fucking head inside out.

1840
02:04:39,438 --> 02:04:41,689
What, were you guys grocery shopping?

1841
02:04:43,108 --> 02:04:46,944
Are we going to make a cake?
You going to make a fucking cake?

1842
02:04:47,196 --> 02:04:49,363
You got anything good in there?

1843
02:04:51,074 --> 02:04:52,116
Is it good?

1844
02:04:57,206 --> 02:04:58,790
Bye-bye, dickhead.

1845
02:05:01,919 --> 02:05:03,377
See you in Attica, dick.

1846
02:05:03,962 --> 02:05:07,173
I spoke to Jimmy.
He offered to give me some money.

1847
02:05:07,716 --> 02:05:10,968
He just wants to know what's happening.
He just wants to talk to you.

1848
02:05:11,136 --> 02:05:12,553
Fuck Jimmy and his money.

1849
02:05:12,721 --> 02:05:15,932
I got to straighten out everything
with Paulie or I'm dead.

1850
02:05:16,850 --> 02:05:18,476
Then you're better off staying in here.

1851
02:05:18,644 --> 02:05:22,230
They could whack me in here as easy
as outside, maybe even easier.

1852
02:05:22,397 --> 02:05:24,023
They're afraid I'll rat them out.

1853
02:05:24,191 --> 02:05:28,027
People are already walking away from me.
I'm dead in here. You got to get me out.

1854
02:05:28,612 --> 02:05:33,241
Karen finally got her mother to put
her house up for my bail and I was out.

1855
02:05:33,408 --> 02:05:37,495
I remember I had this feeling
I would be killed right outside the jail.

1856
02:05:37,913 --> 02:05:41,082
I knew Paulie was still pissed at me,
and he's such a hothead.

1857
02:05:41,250 --> 02:05:43,000
And I was worried about Jimmy.

1858
02:05:43,168 --> 02:05:47,463
See, Jimmy knew if Paulie found out
he was into drug deals with me...

1859
02:05:48,173 --> 02:05:51,217
Paulie would have Jimmy whacked
even before me.

1860
02:05:52,928 --> 02:05:54,554
This is the bad time.

1861
02:05:55,430 --> 02:05:57,682
I didn't feel safe until I got home.

1862
02:05:59,518 --> 02:06:03,271
Now my plan was to stay alive
long enough to sell off the dope...

1863
02:06:03,438 --> 02:06:08,025
the cops never found, then disappear
until I can get things straightened out.

1864
02:06:09,695 --> 02:06:10,653
Fuck!

1865
02:06:10,821 --> 02:06:14,574
- Where's the stuff I left, Karen?
- I flushed it down the toilet.

1866
02:06:16,285 --> 02:06:17,326
You what?

1867
02:06:17,953 --> 02:06:20,454
What was I supposed to do?
They were all over the house.

1868
02:06:20,622 --> 02:06:24,709
That was worth $60,000!
I need that money! That's all we got!

1869
02:06:24,877 --> 02:06:27,545
What was I supposed to do?
They had a search warrant!

1870
02:06:27,713 --> 02:06:32,133
That's all the money we had! I was
depending on that! Why did you do that?

1871
02:06:32,676 --> 02:06:35,469
I had to. They were going to find it!

1872
02:06:35,637 --> 02:06:39,640
- They would have never found it!
- They would have, I swear to you!

1873
02:06:41,059 --> 02:06:42,727
They would've found it!

1874
02:06:44,146 --> 02:06:45,605
Why did you do that?

1875
02:06:45,772 --> 02:06:49,317
- They would have found it.
- Why did you do that, Karen?

1876
02:06:50,569 --> 02:06:52,486
Oh, my God!

1877
02:06:52,988 --> 02:06:55,907
- I had to do it.
- Oh, my God.

1878
02:07:32,027 --> 02:07:33,986
Paulie, I'm really sorry.

1879
02:07:36,657 --> 02:07:39,408
I don't know what else to say.
I know I fucked up.

1880
02:07:39,576 --> 02:07:41,243
Yeah, you fucked up.

1881
02:07:44,915 --> 02:07:46,832
But I'm all right now.

1882
02:07:48,377 --> 02:07:52,755
I can be trusted now. I'm clean.
On my kids, I'm clean.

1883
02:07:52,923 --> 02:07:55,132
You looked in my eyes and lied to me.

1884
02:07:56,426 --> 02:07:58,552
You treated me like a fucking jerk.

1885
02:07:59,179 --> 02:08:00,680
Like I was never nothing to you.

1886
02:08:00,847 --> 02:08:03,724
After what you said,
I couldn't come to you.

1887
02:08:04,851 --> 02:08:07,228
You know, I was ashamed.

1888
02:08:10,232 --> 02:08:12,233
I'm ashamed now.

1889
02:08:15,570 --> 02:08:17,738
But I got nowhere else to go, Paulie.

1890
02:08:20,951 --> 02:08:25,246
You're all I've got.
And I really need your help. I really do.

1891
02:08:31,461 --> 02:08:32,545
Take this.

1892
02:08:47,602 --> 02:08:49,729
And now I've got to turn my back on you.

1893
02:09:00,115 --> 02:09:01,782
$3,200.

1894
02:09:02,367 --> 02:09:06,370
That's what he gave me.
$3,200 for a lifetime.

1895
02:09:07,289 --> 02:09:09,498
It wasn't even enough
to pay for the coffin.

1896
02:09:09,708 --> 02:09:11,751
- We got to get out.
- I don't want to run.

1897
02:09:11,918 --> 02:09:16,297
I don't want to. Am I supposed to pick up
and leave everything? Go hiding?

1898
02:09:16,715 --> 02:09:19,216
I don't want to do that.
Is that what you want?

1899
02:09:19,384 --> 02:09:21,552
If we stay around here, we're dead.

1900
02:09:22,304 --> 02:09:24,138
You got it? We're dead.

1901
02:09:24,806 --> 02:09:25,806
They're right.

1902
02:09:26,391 --> 02:09:29,351
You took too much of that stuff.
You're totally paranoid.

1903
02:09:32,939 --> 02:09:34,774
How's he doing? Busting his balls or what?

1904
02:09:34,941 --> 02:09:35,941
He's okay.

1905
02:09:37,152 --> 02:09:38,402
They sobered him up.

1906
02:09:38,904 --> 02:09:40,780
Good. Very good. Glad to hear it.

1907
02:09:44,993 --> 02:09:47,286
You know what kind of questions
they're asking him?

1908
02:09:47,454 --> 02:09:49,038
Jimmy, I don't know.

1909
02:09:50,123 --> 02:09:53,667
I got my mind on so many other things.
I got no money...

1910
02:09:54,211 --> 02:09:56,837
The girls are old enough
to read the newspapers.

1911
02:09:57,005 --> 02:09:59,006
Tell him he's got to call me. Okay?

1912
02:09:59,883 --> 02:10:03,511
As soon as you talk to him,
he's got to call me. It's important.

1913
02:10:03,845 --> 02:10:07,473
He doesn't know I came here to see you.
It's like he's crazy.

1914
02:10:07,641 --> 02:10:10,684
- Take this. It's a couple of thousands.
- Thanks, Jimmy.

1915
02:10:10,936 --> 02:10:12,853
Don't worry, everything will be all right.

1916
02:10:13,021 --> 02:10:16,357
I got some beautiful Dior dresses.
You want to have them?

1917
02:10:16,608 --> 02:10:18,484
Pick out a few for yourself.

1918
02:10:19,277 --> 02:10:20,945
- For my mom.
- Yeah, whatever.

1919
02:10:21,363 --> 02:10:24,031
No. It's over here.
In the store on the corner.

1920
02:10:24,199 --> 02:10:26,617
It's swag, so I got it down on the corner.

1921
02:10:32,582 --> 02:10:34,083
Go ahead, sweetheart, I'll see you.

1922
02:10:34,543 --> 02:10:36,252
- Thanks, Jimmy.
- Don't worry.

1923
02:10:36,461 --> 02:10:39,046
- I'll try.
- Don't forget, he's got to call me.

1924
02:10:41,675 --> 02:10:43,884
- Over here?
- Right down there.

1925
02:10:58,900 --> 02:11:00,568
It's over there, on the corner.

1926
02:11:01,236 --> 02:11:02,528
Right there.

1927
02:11:36,730 --> 02:11:38,856
No, go ahead. It's right in there.

1928
02:11:39,024 --> 02:11:41,108
No, Jimmy. I'm in a hurry!

1929
02:11:41,443 --> 02:11:44,278
My mom's watching the kids!
I got to get home!

1930
02:11:44,446 --> 02:11:45,946
I'll come back later!

1931
02:12:08,386 --> 02:12:10,012
Karen!

1932
02:12:14,517 --> 02:12:15,768
What happened?

1933
02:12:16,978 --> 02:12:17,978
Nothing.

1934
02:12:18,605 --> 02:12:20,481
- What happened?
- I just got scared.

1935
02:12:23,985 --> 02:12:25,152
Got the keys?

1936
02:12:26,905 --> 02:12:30,532
- What happened, Karen?
- I just got scared. It's okay.

1937
02:12:30,700 --> 02:12:32,326
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1938
02:12:39,209 --> 02:12:43,796
If you're part of a crew, nobody ever
tells you they're going to kill you.

1939
02:12:44,339 --> 02:12:46,090
It doesn't happen that way.

1940
02:12:46,258 --> 02:12:49,677
There aren't any arguments
or curses like in the movies.

1941
02:12:49,844 --> 02:12:53,931
Your murderers come with smiles.
They come as your friends.

1942
02:12:54,099 --> 02:12:56,141
People who cared for you all your life.

1943
02:12:56,309 --> 02:13:00,688
They always seem to come when you're
weakest and most in need of their help.

1944
02:13:01,022 --> 02:13:04,275
So I met Jimmy in a crowded place
we both knew.

1945
02:13:04,651 --> 02:13:08,654
I got there 15 minutes early,
and Jimmy was already there.

1946
02:13:09,072 --> 02:13:13,492
He took the booth near the window
so he could see everyone who drove up.

1947
02:13:13,827 --> 02:13:16,203
He wanted to make sure I wasn't tailed.

1948
02:13:16,621 --> 02:13:19,498
He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing.

1949
02:13:20,542 --> 02:13:23,544
On the surface,
everything was supposed to be fine.

1950
02:13:23,712 --> 02:13:26,046
We were supposed to be discussing
my case.

1951
02:13:26,214 --> 02:13:31,176
But I had a feeling Jimmy was trying
to sense if I'd rat on him to save my neck.

1952
02:13:32,846 --> 02:13:36,557
I been telling you your whole life,
don't talk on the phone.

1953
02:13:36,766 --> 02:13:38,559
Now you understand?

1954
02:13:41,229 --> 02:13:44,565
It's going to be okay.
You got a good chance to beat the case.

1955
02:13:47,736 --> 02:13:51,989
You know that kid from the city
we were talking about? You know?

1956
02:13:54,409 --> 02:13:58,620
The kid turned out to be a rat. As soon as
he got pinched, he ratted on everybody.

1957
02:14:01,416 --> 02:14:03,334
I know where he is. He's hiding now.

1958
02:14:05,253 --> 02:14:06,587
Know what I'm saying?

1959
02:14:11,593 --> 02:14:14,762
Would you have a problem going
with Anthony to take care of that?

1960
02:14:17,849 --> 02:14:19,099
No, not at all.

1961
02:14:20,727 --> 02:14:22,311
That way they got nothing.

1962
02:14:31,154 --> 02:14:33,906
Jimmy had never asked me
to whack somebody before.

1963
02:14:34,366 --> 02:14:38,035
But now he's asking me to go to Florida
and do a hit with Anthony.

1964
02:14:45,585 --> 02:14:48,921
That's when I knew I would never
have come back from Florida alive.

1965
02:15:03,311 --> 02:15:06,605
Whenever you move me,
I asked once and I'll tell you again...

1966
02:15:06,773 --> 02:15:08,607
I don't want to go any place cold.

1967
02:15:09,609 --> 02:15:11,777
You don't have a choice in that matter.

1968
02:15:12,153 --> 02:15:14,696
Come on. Whoever fucking controls it...

1969
02:15:15,490 --> 02:15:18,158
just no place cold. Do that for me.
I'm trying to...

1970
02:15:18,326 --> 02:15:20,035
He's bronchial, that's why.

1971
02:15:20,203 --> 02:15:22,788
If he's legitimately bronchial,
we'll consider that.

1972
02:15:22,956 --> 02:15:25,165
I'd like to go someplace not cold.

1973
02:15:25,333 --> 02:15:29,044
Can I ask you some questions?
What about my parents?

1974
02:15:30,171 --> 02:15:31,171
What about them?

1975
02:15:31,339 --> 02:15:33,799
Am I going to see them?
Am I going to talk to them?

1976
02:15:35,051 --> 02:15:37,469
Don't I have some kind of contact
with them?

1977
02:15:38,138 --> 02:15:39,179
No.

1978
02:15:40,306 --> 02:15:43,642
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me that...

1979
02:15:44,018 --> 02:15:48,021
God forbid something happens to my
parents, they get sick, I can't see them?

1980
02:15:48,189 --> 02:15:51,191
Maybe something can be worked out
if they're sick...

1981
02:15:51,693 --> 02:15:53,861
if there's extraordinary circumstances...

1982
02:15:54,028 --> 02:15:56,864
I can't do this. I can't do this, Henry.

1983
02:15:57,991 --> 02:15:59,741
I can't leave my parents.

1984
02:16:00,994 --> 02:16:03,203
Excuse me, Karen, I told you before.

1985
02:16:04,456 --> 02:16:07,458
I'm not going to do this
unless you and the kids come with me.

1986
02:16:09,794 --> 02:16:11,462
I can't do it without you.

1987
02:16:11,880 --> 02:16:15,966
So, you do whatever, but... that's it.

1988
02:16:17,510 --> 02:16:20,053
- You need Henry, not me, right?
- That's right.

1989
02:16:20,388 --> 02:16:22,848
Frankly, I don't care
whether you go or not.

1990
02:16:23,183 --> 02:16:26,477
If it'll make him a better witness,
I'd like you to be with him.

1991
02:16:26,644 --> 02:16:28,312
They want Henry, not me.

1992
02:16:28,480 --> 02:16:31,565
Henry'll be in the protection program.
They can't get to him.

1993
02:16:32,484 --> 02:16:35,903
They can only get to him
by getting to you or your kids.

1994
02:16:36,070 --> 02:16:38,489
If he goes into the program,
you're in danger...

1995
02:16:38,656 --> 02:16:41,074
- I don't know anything.
- Don't give me...

1996
02:16:41,242 --> 02:16:42,618
the babe-in-the-woods routine.

1997
02:16:42,785 --> 02:16:47,372
I've listened to those wiretaps,
and I've heard you talk about cocaine.

1998
02:16:47,540 --> 02:16:50,751
Conversation after conversation
you talked to Henry on the phone.

1999
02:16:56,007 --> 02:16:58,050
It doesn't matter.
Whether he goes to jail...

2000
02:16:58,218 --> 02:17:01,512
or stays on the streets and beats the case,
he's a dead man.

2001
02:17:02,263 --> 02:17:03,972
He knows it and you know it.

2002
02:17:05,600 --> 02:17:07,309
What about the kids and school?

2003
02:17:07,477 --> 02:17:09,770
Will they get left back?
I mean, what goes on?

2004
02:17:10,104 --> 02:17:12,523
Go to Wall Street and get real crooks.

2005
02:17:12,690 --> 02:17:15,150
Whoever sold you those suits
had a sense of humor.

2006
02:17:15,360 --> 02:17:18,403
What it comes down to is
we're your only salvation.

2007
02:17:19,239 --> 02:17:22,658
We'll save your life and his life,
and we'll keep you out of jail.

2008
02:17:26,913 --> 02:17:29,540
This morning you told the jury
about your background.

2009
02:17:29,707 --> 02:17:31,542
It was easy for us to disappear.

2010
02:17:32,085 --> 02:17:34,211
My house
was in my mother-in-law's name.

2011
02:17:34,379 --> 02:17:36,338
My cars were registered to my wife.

2012
02:17:36,506 --> 02:17:39,967
My Social Security cards
and driver's licenses were phonies.

2013
02:17:40,134 --> 02:17:42,469
I never voted or paid taxes.

2014
02:17:43,054 --> 02:17:47,516
My birth certificate and arrest sheet was
all you'd ever have to know I was alive.

2015
02:17:47,684 --> 02:17:50,227
- Do you see him here in this courtroom?
- Yes.

2016
02:17:50,645 --> 02:17:52,980
Will you please point him out for the jury?

2017
02:17:55,650 --> 02:18:00,279
Let the record reflect that Mr. Hill
identified the defendant, James Conway.

2018
02:18:01,406 --> 02:18:04,491
Do you also know a man
named Paul Cicero?

2019
02:18:04,826 --> 02:18:06,827
- Do you see him in the courtroom?
- Yes.

2020
02:18:07,412 --> 02:18:09,329
Can you point him out for the jury?

2021
02:18:11,291 --> 02:18:15,419
Let the record reflect that Mr. Hill
identified the defendant, Paul Cicero.

2022
02:18:16,713 --> 02:18:18,422
Your Honor, I have a document...

2023
02:18:18,590 --> 02:18:21,008
The hardest thing was leaving the life.

2024
02:18:21,759 --> 02:18:23,302
I still love the life.

2025
02:18:23,678 --> 02:18:25,596
We were treated like movie stars
with muscle.

2026
02:18:25,763 --> 02:18:28,015
We had it all, just for the asking.

2027
02:18:28,182 --> 02:18:31,518
Our wives, mothers, kids,
everybody rode along.

2028
02:18:31,853 --> 02:18:35,022
I had paper bags filled with jewelry
stashed in the kitchen.

2029
02:18:35,189 --> 02:18:37,441
I had a sugar bowl full of coke
next to the bed.

2030
02:18:37,609 --> 02:18:41,403
People call them rats because rats do
anything to survive. Isn't that right?

2031
02:18:41,571 --> 02:18:43,614
- Objection!
- Objection sustained.

2032
02:18:43,781 --> 02:18:46,867
- I know nothing about being a rat.
- You know everything about it.

2033
02:18:47,869 --> 02:18:49,578
Objection, Your Honor.
In view of the violence...

2034
02:18:49,746 --> 02:18:51,705
Anything I wanted was a phone call away.

2035
02:18:51,873 --> 02:18:55,292
Free cars. Keys to a dozen hideout flats
all over the city.

2036
02:18:55,460 --> 02:18:57,961
I'd bet $20,000, $30,000 over a weekend...

2037
02:18:58,129 --> 02:19:02,299
then blow the winnings in a week
or go to the sharks to pay the bookies.

2038
02:19:02,467 --> 02:19:03,675
It didn't matter.

2039
02:19:04,218 --> 02:19:09,097
It didn't mean anything. When I was broke
I would go out and rob some more.

2040
02:19:09,515 --> 02:19:10,891
We ran everything.

2041
02:19:11,434 --> 02:19:15,729
We paid off cops. We paid off lawyers.
We paid off judges.

2042
02:19:15,980 --> 02:19:19,399
Everybody had their hands out.
Everything was for the taking.

2043
02:19:21,527 --> 02:19:23,028
And now it's all over.

2044
02:19:23,946 --> 02:19:25,405
That's the hardest part.

2045
02:19:26,407 --> 02:19:28,033
Today everything is different.

2046
02:19:28,201 --> 02:19:32,371
There's no action.
I have to wait around like everyone else.

2047
02:19:32,747 --> 02:19:34,539
Can't even get decent food.

2048
02:19:35,291 --> 02:19:38,418
After I got here I ordered spaghetti
with marinara sauce...

2049
02:19:38,586 --> 02:19:40,420
and I got egg noodles and ketchup.

2050
02:19:41,255 --> 02:19:42,756
I'm an average nobody.

2051
02:19:44,133 --> 02:19:46,927
I get to live the rest of my life
like a schnook.
