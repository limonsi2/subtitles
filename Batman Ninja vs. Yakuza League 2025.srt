00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:08,402
{\an8}

4
00:01:08,486 --> 00:01:10,780
Ah!

5
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:13,741
Huh? Aah!

6
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:16,744
Dad, look!

7
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:19,497
My hair's gone
back to normal again!

8
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,582
I swear it was a top knot
last night.

9
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:23,417
Hmm.

10
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:26,837
A shame. That hairstyle
looked rather good on you.

11
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:28,589
Huh?

12
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:29,507
<i>Moments ago,</i>

13
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,675
<i>a warning was issued</i>
<i>for a Yakuza Hurricane</i>

14
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,427
<i>approaching Gotham City.</i>

15
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:35,721
<i>A low-pressure system</i>
<i>is currently building</i>

16
00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:38,849
<i>- to the southeast.</i>
- Uh...what did she say?

17
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:41,060
A Yakuza Hurricane.

18
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:42,853
- Let's get to work.
<i>- Strong rain and winds are expected...</i>

19
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:44,396
- Right.
<i>- ...along with a large number</i>

20
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,607
<i>- of yakuza falling from the sky.</i>

21
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,656
Damian, after we got back
from feudal Japan yesterday,

22
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:57,243
I needed to know if we
prevented history from changing.

23
00:01:57,326 --> 00:02:00,162
I went to search for deviations
in modern-day Japan,

24
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:02,373
but as you can clearly see...

25
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:04,834
Japan is gone?

26
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:09,046
Yes, the islands of Japan
have disappeared.

27
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,967
And just like your hair,
something is wrong.

28
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:14,927
Hm.

29
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:26,021
Alfred, have you made contact
with the Watchtower?

30
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:27,565
Well, Master Bruce...

31
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:30,317
I'm afraid the Watchtower
does not exist.

32
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:32,236
- Huh?
- It gets worse.

33
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,281
It would seem that Superman,
Wonder Woman, Aquaman,

34
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:39,660
Green Lantern, and Flash
have also disappeared.

35
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:42,621
So we now find ourselves
without a Justice League.

36
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:45,416
It makes sense
that there'd be no Watchtower.

37
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:48,878
Okay, then does this mean
we're on a different Earth or something?

38
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:52,548
No. I already verified
the multiverse frequency.

39
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:55,843
We are definitely standing
on the right planet.

40
00:02:56,176 --> 00:03:00,764
Which tells us one thing:
That history has been changed.

41
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:10,065
Hm!

42
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:19,491
I am transmitting
the forecasted coordinates

43
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:21,785
of the Yakuza Hurricane
to you now.

44
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,245
The yakuza?

45
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:25,122
How does the Japanese mob
fit into this?

46
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,499
I sure hope
something makes sense soon.

47
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,210
Here we go.

48
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:32,004
Let's do it!

49
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,573
Ahh.

50
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,212
Now give 'em hell!

51
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,057
Huh?

52
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:36,777
Hello, Batman. Good to see you.

53
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,613
I guess they weren't kidding
about it raining yakuza.

54
00:04:39,697 --> 00:04:41,073
Well, yeah, of course.

55
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,575
It's raining men,
just like it always does.

56
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:44,576
What the huh?

57
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,786
What's wrong?

58
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,997
We just did the same thing
yesterday.

59
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:49,623
Hyah!

60
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:51,917
The only way this makes any sense
is if we've swapped--

61
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:53,544
- Ha!
- Swapped?

62
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,295
When we returned
from feudal Japan yesterday,

63
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:57,006
we must have swapped places.

64
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:59,466
The versions of us who fought
the yakuza in this timeline

65
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,176
must be somewhere else.

66
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,678
You make it sound simple,

67
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,888
- but isn't that kind of a huge deal?
- You're next, kid! Oof!

68
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:05,889
Huh?

69
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,642
You really should learn
to watch your back, Robin.

70
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:10,602
Oh, mind your own business.

71
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:12,688
I was just about
to wipe the floor with that guy.

72
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:13,981
Oh, you were, huh?

73
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:16,900
I thought all that time in the past
would have straightened you out,

74
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:20,029
but, no, you're right back
to being the same little brat.

75
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:21,989
Come on!

76
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:26,618
What's with the hairdo?

77
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:27,619
- A wig?
- No!

78
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:29,288
It just grew back overnight.

79
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,498
Yeah, whatever you say.

80
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,546
Arrest the lot of 'em!

81
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:40,966
That crazy weather alert
got me off the couch.

82
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,426
Someone care to explain?

83
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,969
Exactly what it looks like.

84
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:46,847
In this Gotham,
yakuza rain from the skies.

85
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,057
- Huh?
- Yeah.

86
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,767
Everything's all out of whack.

87
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,560
The islands of Japan are all gone,

88
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,896
and the Justice League
doesn't exist anymore.

89
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,189
Really?

90
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:59,860
But if there's no Japan,
how are yakuza falling from the sky?

91
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:00,861
- Huh?
- Mm?

92
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,992
Holy cow!

93
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,631
Is that really Japan?

94
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,800
Floating directly over Gotham.

95
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,010
What are you looking at up there?

96
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:27,096
Can you not see the huge island?

97
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:28,847
An island?

98
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:30,641
Okay, then.

99
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,726
I guess now we know where
the yakuza are coming from.

100
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,646
I can't find anything about the island.

101
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:39,066
And it would seem the four of us
are the only ones who can see it.

102
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,276
I'm going up to investigate.

103
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,904
- The rest of you deal with the yakuza.
- Wait! Me too!

104
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,030
Ah!

105
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:48,742
- Hey!
- Better get busy.

106
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:50,744
Somebody's gotta take care
of that mess.

107
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:54,790
<i>Master Bruce,</i>

108
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:58,794
<i>there is a strange energy signature</i>
<i>coming from the anomaly in the sky.</i>

109
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:00,212
<i>Sending you the data now.</i>

110
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,714
It looks like the Quake Engine.

111
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:03,632
<i>Yes.</i>

112
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:06,009
<i>Or at least something very similar to it.</i>

113
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,469
The Quake Engine?

114
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:09,638
Isn't that what sent us
through time before?

115
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,849
This is fallout from using the engine.

116
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:15,185
Japan has been removed
from the space-time continuum.

117
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,688
Even though it looks
like it's floating in the sky,

118
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,774
it's actually drifting
through a fissure in space-time.

119
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:23,277
So maybe the reason
only we can see it

120
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,945
is because we went through time too.

121
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:28,782
Right. And we don't belong
in this timeline.

122
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:32,911
We have been displaced in time,
just like that island has.

123
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:35,289
We need to recover the Quake Engine

124
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:38,333
and then use it to return
space-time back to normal.

125
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:41,920
We're entering the fissure.

126
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:43,380
Brace yourself!

feudal Japan, does it?

138
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,636
<i>There's a signal near the Tokyo area.</i>

139
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:13,804
Thanks, I see it.

140
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,264
It's enemy territory.

141
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:17,057
Going radio silent for a while.

142
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,684
<i>Noted, Master Bruce.</i>

143
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:29,945
Is that Green Lantern?

144
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:41,665
I commend you for making it
as far as you have,

145
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,125
but it was foolish.

146
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:47,296
You have entered an area
controlled by the Hagane Family,

147
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,965
and I'll be damned
if you encroach any further,

148
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,301
for I am Zeshika the Emerald Ray.

149
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:57,889
Is that Jessica Cruz?

150
00:09:57,973 --> 00:09:59,141
Not exactly.

151
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:00,851
This woman's dressed
in a kimono.

152
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:24,249
Oh, no, you don't!

153
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:29,963
Hang on! Aquaman, too?!

154
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:33,008
I'm second-in-command
to the Hagane Family,

155
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:34,551
Ahsa the Aqua Dragon!

156
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,553
Now get a taste of the spinning blades

157
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,348
from the trident of
the ruler of the waves!

158
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,570
First a Yakuza Hurricane.

159
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,197
Now a yakuza tornado?

160
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,448
Sorta.

161
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:59,284
Tornadoes form on the ground
and pull things upwards.

162
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:01,703
Since this is coming from the skies,

163
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:04,373
it would technically be
a yakuza downburst.

164
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:06,917
I didn't ask if you were a weatherman.

165
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,001
Hmm?

166
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:10,295
- What is that?
- Huh?

167
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:14,800
Invisible to the eyes,
unheard by the ears,

168
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:18,345
a red blur that comes
and goes like lightning.

169
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:21,515
Known to be the fastest man
in the Hagane Family,

170
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,809
but I'm the fastest man alive!

171
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:26,645
I'm the Fleet of Foot, Bari!

172
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,025
It's Flash!

173
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:36,029
I see you've been giving
my boys here some trouble,

174
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:38,782
so I'm here to put you in your place!

175
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:44,246
Hyah!

176
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:47,082
Come on! Come on! Come on!

177
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:55,090
Where are you going?

178
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:58,718
We have orders from the oyabun
to eliminate trespassers.

179
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:11,398
It's nothing personal,
just how we do business.

180
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,275
Now, say goodbye!

181
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,903
Aah! Oof!

182
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:23,285
That's quite enough
out of you for today.

183
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,163
Daiana.

184
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:29,624
Carved upon this burnished skin

185
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:32,544
and polished in the Inokashira waters

186
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:35,630
for reasons only the gods could know...

187
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:38,550
a gold eagle soars through the skies,

188
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:41,178
and as the woman who leads her clan

189
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:44,097
by turning brutes and thugs
into warriors...

190
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:46,433
I am the Eagle Goddess, Daiana.

191
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:50,020
You should know
not to underestimate me.

192
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,899
You should know
to stay out of this!

193
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,235
Back off, Daiana!

194
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:02,157
Hyah!

195
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:11,166
Hyah!

196
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:20,550
You're in Kichijoji,
and it belongs to the Amazone Family.

197
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:22,427
Oh! Oof!

198
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:28,808
Those men are
my guests in our land,

199
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:31,102
and allowing you
to lay a finger on them

200
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:34,064
would disrespect the name
of Daiana, the Eagle Goddess.

201
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,607
And I won't have it!

202
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,651
Ha!

203
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,283
Your life is on the line.

204
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:48,328
I suggest you think about
if these two are worth it.

205
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:53,166
Are you smart enough to know
when to back down, Aqua Dragon?

206
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,300
Beepity-beep! Honky-honk!
Comin' through!

207
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,344
Your attention please!

208
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,058
Guess who's here, kids!

209
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:15,939
I hail from the wonderful whirling
cesspool of grime and greed, Gotham!

210
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,066
I fell for a clown prince of a man

211
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,236
and started to play pretend
I'm a psycho hoodlum.

212
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:26,491
Then I met the badass warrior babe Daiana,
and started kicking ass for her.

213
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:29,452
I'm Harin the Wild Jester!

214
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:32,289
It's a pleasure for you to meet me.

215
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:33,999
Now let's dance!

216
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:37,335
Hyah!

217
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:41,715
Come on! Come on!
Come on!

218
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,383
Yeah!

219
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,427
What's wrong?
Having a difficult time?

220
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,138
Well, yeah. We're dealing
with a speedy fella.

221
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,223
We need a way to slow him down.

222
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:51,766
Hmm.

223
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:56,813
Come on, come on, bring it!

224
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,982
Aah! Aah! Aah!

225
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:04,613
Aah!

226
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:08,617
I'm running out of energy.

227
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,577
Zeshika, we're leaving.

228
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,163
What are you talking about?
The oyabun won't be happy.

229
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,707
I'm the one in charge,
so I call the shots.

230
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,208
Do what I say.

231
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:22,047
Consider yourselves lucky.

232
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:34,517
You boys have done it now.

233
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:35,935
You look hungry.

234
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:38,813
Huh?

235
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:41,316
{\an8}

236
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:48,073
Damn you.
Think you're so clever.

237
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:51,701
Now I'm hungry as hell
and thirsty.

238
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:54,996
I need to save enough stamina
for the trip back,

239
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,998
so this will have to wait.

240
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:58,833
I'll be back!

241
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:01,628
And next time,
you'll get what's coming to ya!

242
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:07,342
Somebody wanna explain
why Flash is all messed up?

243
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:08,968
A lot's messed up.

244
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:10,762
Batman's up there trying to figure it out.

245
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:13,890
So you're telling me
the world is still out of whack?

246
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,350
Looks like it.

247
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,437
Welcome back, Madam Daiana.

248
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,485
A country of nothing but yakuza?

249
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:26,695
Yes.

250
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:28,655
For a very long time now,

251
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:32,117
Hinomoto has been divided
into different yakuza families,

252
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,327
with clashes happening
almost daily.

253
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:37,872
Ultimately, it gave rise
to a great war for territory

254
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:39,708
known as the "Yakuzageddon."

255
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,584
So in order to survive,

256
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,379
everyone was forced
to join one of the syndicates,

257
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:47,465
and now yakuza families
are all that exist.

258
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:49,926
There is no government
nor law enforcement.

259
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,846
It's yakuza rule over yakuza,

260
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:55,014
a place of total anarchy.

261
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,267
Those guys from earlier
were talking about

262
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,310
something called the Hagane Family.

263
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:03,732
<i>Hagane is the dominant syndicate</i>
<i>that rules over most of Japan now.</i>

264
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:06,151
<i>They are the worst of the worst</i>
<i>who will resort</i>

265
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:08,528
<i>to any tactic</i>
<i>they feel necessary to win...</i>

266
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:12,323
<i>...and their reach runs far</i>
<i>and wide across the land.</i>

267
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:15,493
<i>My Amazone Family</i>
<i>and the Doomuzu Family</i>

268
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:17,954
<i>are the only ones with</i>
<i>the strength to oppose them.</i>

269
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,373
<i>But their leader, Deio,</i>
<i>was recently killed</i>

270
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:22,500
<i>and his syndicate fell apart.</i>

271
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:28,256
{\an8}

272
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:33,261
As of now, the only family who
still respects the Ninkyo way is mine,

273
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,472
the Amazone Family.

274
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,599
The Ninkyo way?

275
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:40,393
We will fight for what's right
in the face of death,

276
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:43,605
never at the detriment
to those living honestly.

277
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:47,025
And that is the spirit
of the Ninkyo code.

278
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:50,236
So your people are more than
just your typical villains, aren't they?

279
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,696
That's Wonder Woman for ya.

280
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,989
Wonder what?

281
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,574
Uh, no. Never mind.

282
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,117
In the Hagane Family,

283
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:58,828
is there a man who can
run with incredible speed

284
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:01,623
and a flying man who possesses
superhuman strength?

285
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:04,667
Yes. In fact, there are.

286
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,463
{\an8}<i>One of their most trusted soldiers</i>
<i>is Bari, the Fleet Foot.</i>

287
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:10,673
{\an8}<i>He can outrun</i>
<i>even the speed of sound.</i>

288
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:13,384
<i>Then there is the man faster</i>
<i>than a speeding bullet,</i>

289
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:15,720
<i>more powerful than a locomotive,</i>

290
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:19,307
<i>and he is able to leap tall buildings</i>
<i>in a single bound.</i>

291
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,683
<i>He is their leader.</i>

292
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,727
<i>Kuraku the Man of Steel.</i>

293
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:25,063
<i>That's Flash and Superman.</i>

294
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:27,941
<i>And we've already seen</i>
<i>Green Lantern and Aquaman,</i>

295
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,777
plus Wonder Woman, of course.

296
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,614
So all the heroes that went missing
in our world are now over here.

297
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:37,408
Their Justice League is
more like the Yakuza League.

298
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:39,577
This is no laughing matter.

299
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:44,541
I take it that is
your world up above us.

300
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,544
We refer to it as Amatsukuni.

301
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:48,962
What does it mean?

302
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,588
"The land in the sky."

303
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:56,219
It was about a month ago
when it first appeared in our atmosphere.

304
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,513
A month ago, huh?

305
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,266
That must be right
when time started to diverge.

306
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:04,727
The Hagane Family wants
to rule more than Hinomoto.

307
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:09,274
They've already attacked your lands
in efforts to expand their territory.

308
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,318
<i>They've figured out a way</i>
<i>to reach Amatsukuni</i>

309
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:15,029
<i>by having Bari the Fleet Foot</i>
<i>create a tornado.</i>

310
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:16,489
<i>Let me get this straight.</i>

311
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:18,575
<i>Flash can use his speed</i>
<i>to spin up a tunnel</i>

312
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,952
<i>through the fissure in space-time?</i>

313
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:23,079
Unless someone stops them,

314
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,999
the Hagane Family
will overrun Amatsukuni

315
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,959
and eventually take it over.

316
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:30,920
I cannot turn a blind eye
to such a thing.

317
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:33,756
We battle injustice and help the weak.

318
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,093
The righteous do not deserve
these horrible actions.

319
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,096
It goes against the Ninkyo way.

320
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:42,849
This is Lake Inokashira.

321
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:47,228
In the middle is Nyogogashima,
the Isle of Women.

322
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:50,607
It is also where the
god Benzaiten resides.

323
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,401
Legends say
that when calamity befalls us,

324
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:57,822
an incarnation of Benzaiten
will arise to save all of Japan.

325
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:01,034
I was bestowed a fraction
of Benzaiten's powers

326
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,535
and then dispatched here.

327
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,454
I have a mission--

328
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,373
protecting Hinomoto
and the Ninkyo spirit--

329
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:09,250
and I will do that with my life.

330
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:11,336
Kinda seems
like Wonder Woman's personality

331
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:13,504
is more intact than the others.

332
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:15,632
This version of Japan
has its own reality,

333
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:18,635
isolated from the rest
of the space-time continuum.

334
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:21,804
Some form of convergent evolution.

335
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:24,390
The heroes have likely had
some evolutionary changes

336
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:26,434
due to the ecology of this world.

337
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,519
So did all of this happen
because of our battle

338
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:29,729
back in feudal Japan?

339
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:32,065
No. It's doubtful
for so many elements

340
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,775
to line up by mere coincidence.

341
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,944
It's more likely
that someone had a hand in it.

342
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,321
Yeah, I guess so.

343
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,449
Can you point me in the direction
where we crashed earlier?

344
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:43,409
I would like to repair the Batwing.

345
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:45,286
Of course. Follow me.

346
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:52,251
We have already recovered
your airplane.

347
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:55,380
Don't worry. The Hagane Family
cannot attack you here.

348
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:56,965
How did you get it here?

349
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:58,675
I had my wards carry it.

350
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,594
Thank you.
Must have taken some work.

351
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:04,764
Oh, no.
They've managed much worse.

352
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,265
That said...

353
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:10,561
hauling back two in one day
did prove a little taxing.

354
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:11,854
That plane.

355
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,732
It belongs to Harley Quinn.

356
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:17,193
Aw, you got me!

357
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:20,154
You are the same Harley
I know from Gotham, aren't you?

358
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:21,614
Yeah. It's me.

359
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:24,951
<i>Unlike you dorks,</i>
<i>I blended in nice and easy.</i>

360
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:27,787
{\an8}<i>Then I met</i>
<i>this beautiful boss lady.</i>

361
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,581
{\an8}<i>I mean, this chick</i>
<i>can command a room, am I right?</i>

362
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:32,667
{\an8}So I stuck around and she let me stay.

363
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,751
Hold on.

364
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:37,338
You haven't been here for more
than half a day longer than we have.

365
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:39,048
Acclimated incredibly fast.

366
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:41,300
- I'm cool like that.
- Uh, 'kay, so...

367
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:43,594
how can you be
the real Harley Quinn?

368
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:46,556
I thought we left you in the
custody of the cops last night.

369
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:47,890
Hello! Newsflash!

370
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,642
Gotham PD ain't too smart.

371
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:52,103
- Did Joker escape too?
- Who knows? Oop!

372
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:54,272
Spill it!
What did you come here for?

373
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:56,441
Because it looked like
a total blast.

374
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:59,235
I mean, a freaking
giant Japan floating in the sky?

375
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,070
How could I possibly resist?

376
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:03,823
I don't trust you.
Tell me, where the hell is The Joker?

377
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:05,324
I dunno.

378
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:07,368
We're not joined at the hip,
you know.

379
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:08,578
Don't lie to me!

380
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,079
That is enough.

381
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:12,248
I do not know your relationship,

382
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,334
but the two of you
are guests in my home...

383
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:18,379
so please refrain from fighting
while you're here.

384
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:19,630
Hmph.

385
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:22,425
"Lift up the honor of others."

386
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,093
The pathway to respect.

387
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:26,512
I'm glad that you
understand our customs.

388
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:29,599
There. See? Mm-hmm!

389
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:30,516
Really?

390
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,185
When it comes to the samurai,

391
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:35,772
one's honor is cherished even
more so than their own lives.

392
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,690
I can appreciate that, ma'am.

393
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:39,817
A wealth of knowledge.

394
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:42,111
I knew you were more than ordinary.

395
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:46,115
Despite the dark mask you wear
to cover up your face,

396
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:49,202
you must be a reputable oyabun
where you're from.

397
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:52,080
Oyabun?
No. I am no leader.

398
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:53,289
Whatever.

399
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,333
He heads up
the whole Bat Family.

400
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:58,044
Everybody in the underworld
knows all about that freak

401
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,754
and hates his guts too!

402
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:01,380
Right, Batty Man?

403
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:02,840
The Bat Family?

404
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:05,468
I'm not surprised you
would have a syndicate.

405
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,678
Harley, you need to keep
your mouth shut.

406
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:10,139
The oyabun of the Bat cartel.

407
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:11,766
- Interesting.
- It's not like that.

408
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:13,726
I don't know, man.
Sounds kinda rad.

409
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,686
Be quiet.

410
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:18,606
- Where are you going?
- So sorry, Daiana.

411
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,441
Appreciate all ya done for me,

412
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:23,986
but there's no way I can be on
the same squad as those losers.

413
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,863
You mind if I park the plane here?

414
00:23:25,947 --> 00:23:27,907
Thanks! Bye-bye!

415
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:30,535
Shouldn't we go after her?

416
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:33,246
No. Repairs take priority.

417
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:35,206
We'll return to the Batcave.

418
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:38,209
I've had plans in place
to defeat the Justice League.

419
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:39,210
Huh?

420
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:43,214
I've always been prepared in case
I ever needed to take them down.

421
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:46,759
Turning on your own allies.
That is so you.

422
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:53,182
All finished with your repairs?

423
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:55,309
Yes. Thank you for your help.

424
00:23:55,393 --> 00:23:56,811
- We'll return soon...
- Huh?

425
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:59,772
...and I will put a stop
to the Hagane tyranny.

426
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:00,857
Aw.

427
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:12,368
We're approaching
the space-time fissure.

428
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:15,830
<i>Something is closing</i>
<i>in on the Batwing.</i>

429
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:17,623
Oh, and pretty fast too.

430
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:19,417
I figured he'd show up sooner
or later.

431
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:47,570
You've got quite the audacity
to trespass into my territory

432
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,906
and not come say hello.

433
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,032
And who are you?

434
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:53,492
Kuraku, the Man of Steel.

435
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:56,120
I am in charge
of protecting the Hagane Family.

436
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:01,876
What are you planning
to do with us?

437
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,628
Come along, Robin!

438
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:05,963
The Great Oyabun would like
to have a word.

439
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:09,008
- You're not the boss?
- Hard to imagine someone above you.

440
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:10,009
Yes.

441
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:13,763
The Great Oyabun is the one
who has led us down this path.

442
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,681
Do not resist.

443
00:25:15,765 --> 00:25:19,685
I have orders to eliminate you
if you try to make things difficult.

444
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:23,272
I must ask, how does
your Great Oyabun refer to me?

445
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:25,900
You are the Detective,

446
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:28,694
the worthless trash who
collects dirt on other people.

447
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:29,904
There you have it.

448
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:32,323
That tells me pretty much
everything I need to know.

449
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:33,658
You think so?

450
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:34,909
Yeah.

451
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:37,245
It looks like we're
dealing with Ra's al Ghul.

452
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:38,454
Hm?

453
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:41,457
<i> Still as sharp</i>
<i>as ever, Detective.</i>

454
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,708
Of course it's you.

455
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:45,878
<i>But it seems you figured it out</i>
<i>a little too late.</i>

456
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:50,925
<i>I even had enough time to</i>
<i>hack into the Bat-Tech of your vehicle.</i>

457
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:53,886
<i>Now, come, grandson,</i>
<i>I need to talk to you.</i>

458
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:11,028
Looks like you're in it
pretty deep, Batty Man!

459
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:12,071
The Joker!

460
00:26:14,282 --> 00:26:17,326
Now let's get this party started!

461
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,580
Stay out of my way!

462
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:23,040
You kidding me?!

463
00:26:23,124 --> 00:26:25,501
Getting in the way
is my favorite pastime.

464
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,378
Besides, the only one

465
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:29,797
who gets the pleasure
of killing the Batman is me!

466
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:34,302
No way in hell some phony
super fella gets to do it.

467
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:36,512
The Great Oyabun
gave me an order,

468
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,557
- and I will follow through!
- Aah! Aah!

469
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,726
- Wahoo!
- Damian!

470
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:43,894
<i>- Excellent work, Kuraku.</i>
- Hey! Put me back!

471
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:45,938
<i>- I'll see you soon.</i>
- Aah!

472
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:48,441
No, no, no,
don't just throw me!

473
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:54,780
You never should have come here,
you rotten piece of trash!

474
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:06,042
Harley! I'll let you
duke it out with the big guy.

475
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:08,085
What?!
Are you freaking kidding me?!

476
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:11,255
Oh, don't worry.
I'm sure you'll be fine. You got this.

477
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:13,341
- Huh?
- Love you, boo! Have fun!

478
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:17,595
Uh...

479
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:25,936
It's time for the good little
Bat birdies to go on home!

480
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:32,693
You wanna get back to Gotham,
don't you?

481
00:27:32,777 --> 00:27:36,197
<i>Well, I'm feeling I could do</i>
<i>you a wee favor today, Bats.</i>

482
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,115
<i>- Mwah!</i>
- And just abandon Harley?

483
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:41,952
Abandon her? Don't be silly.
I'm giving her the spotlight.

484
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:43,079
Ain't that right, baby?

485
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:46,040
What?!
I'm just your chopper fodder!

486
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:49,335
This is your stupidest prank
ever, Joker!

487
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:54,256
Wha!

488
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:59,303
Time for you to die!

489
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:02,973
Aah! Aah! Oof!

490
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:12,608
Mind your own business,
Amazone wench.

491
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,444
This girl is my personal guest.

492
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:18,072
I don't care which family you work for.

493
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:20,032
I won't let you lay a finger on her.

494
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:24,453
<i>I caught the kid.</i>
<i>He's safe and sound.</i>

495
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:26,330
Okay. Good work.

496
00:28:27,123 --> 00:28:30,126
We all live within
the underbelly of society.

497
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,420
Only the strongest survive.

498
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:35,131
It's simply
how the yakuza world works.

499
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:38,342
Our path in life is forged
through crime and violence.

500
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:43,139
Along that path,
hell is all that awaits you.

501
00:28:43,431 --> 00:28:46,392
Demons and yakuza
are both the same.

502
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:49,520
You'll find soon enough
when I take your head off.

503
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:52,481
Lucky for me,
I've got a strong neck,

504
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:54,692
so you're going to
have to work for it.

505
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:55,860
Hm.

506
00:28:57,987 --> 00:28:59,280
You still alive?

507
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:01,282
Yeah, more or less.

508
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:03,242
Uh, why'd you save me?

509
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:04,577
It's like I said:

510
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,413
I will not let anyone be rude
to my guests.

511
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,415
I refuse to watch a girl suffer,

512
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:13,043
especially one caught
in the crossfire between men.

513
00:29:13,127 --> 00:29:15,379
The Amazone Family
is a refuge for women,

514
00:29:15,463 --> 00:29:17,089
as well as their tears.

515
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:20,801
Not sure what
that's supposed to mean,

516
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:23,429
but I can say
I appreciate the sentiment.

517
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:27,057
That's just fine.
The Ninkyo way is about heart,

518
00:29:27,141 --> 00:29:28,392
mine and yours.

519
00:29:29,143 --> 00:29:30,269
Mm-hmm.

520
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:37,860
Ah, here we are,
back in good ol' Gotham proper.

521
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,862
<i>Joker, why are you doing this?</i>

522
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:42,364
I'd like to preserve the
pleasure of killing you myself.

523
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:44,742
And I don't know if I could
stomach the thought of

524
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:48,162
some know-it-all super sucker
having all the fun.

525
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:51,624
Especially if that old fart
Ra's is pulling the strings.

526
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:54,376
So you rescued me to kill me?
That's dumb.

527
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,087
<i>- No need to thank me, buddy!</i>
- You're always up to something.

528
00:29:57,171 --> 00:29:58,380
<i>Oh, come on!</i>

529
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:00,216
<i>You and I go back.</i>

530
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:03,552
<i>You can trust me.</i>
<i>When have I ever led you astray?</i>

531
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:08,015
Smell ya later, Batty!

532
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:11,310
Don't get into much trouble!

533
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:12,895
- Batman!
- Ah.

534
00:30:16,774 --> 00:30:19,860
{\an8}

535
00:30:19,944 --> 00:30:22,029
{\an8}Irasshai. Come in.

536
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:26,992
Zeshika, very well done.

537
00:30:27,076 --> 00:30:28,202
You may go.

538
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:29,537
Yes, sir.

539
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,664
Your seared salmon, sir.

540
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,627
- Can I get a California roll?
- Nice.

541
00:30:37,962 --> 00:30:40,464
Are you familiar
with "oral seasoning"?

542
00:30:40,548 --> 00:30:42,091
Can't say that I am.

543
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:43,551
With sushi rice,

544
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:46,136
you can pair an endless amount
of combinations,

545
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:49,223
and all those infinite
possibilities eventually become

546
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:52,226
a singular phenomenon
for each individual.

547
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:53,686
Interesting, yes?

548
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:56,063
What are you talking about,
old man?

549
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:58,315
The Japanese people are masters

550
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,943
at layering these wondrous
flavors together

551
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:04,196
to create a new universe
within every meal.

552
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:08,033
So you're trying to tell me something
about this whole new Japan thing?

553
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:11,412
- Ubu, turn on the television.
- Sir.

554
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:13,747
What am I looking at?

555
00:31:13,831 --> 00:31:17,668
The moment just before
you were all sent to feudal Japan.

556
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:21,130
I had already received word
of Gorilla Grodd's plans

557
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:24,425
to develop the Quake Engine
and use it to warp space-time.

558
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:27,845
Okay, so this place
was created by the Quake Engine.

559
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:29,221
That's what we figured.

560
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:31,223
Oh, it's far more advanced
than that.

561
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:33,392
I improved upon its design

562
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:36,645
to allow the engine
to shift space-time itself.

563
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:40,274
The idea was to stack
multiple worlds over each other

564
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:42,026
and change their shape.

565
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:48,073
I could conjure an entirely new world
by simply overlaying different scenarios,

566
00:31:48,157 --> 00:31:51,952
and this yakuza version
of Japan was ultimately born.

567
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:57,791
<i>So, what if an alien from Krypton</i>
<i>who was meant to end up in America</i>

568
00:31:57,875 --> 00:32:02,254
<i>instead landed in Japan and</i>
<i>was raised by a yakuza family?</i>

569
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:07,426
<i>What if there was an island of women</i>
<i>in the middle of Lake Inokashira?</i>

570
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:12,473
<i>And what if a descendant</i>
<i>of the gods was born there?</i>

571
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:16,810
<i>And what if there was</i>
<i>a species of aquatic people</i>

572
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:19,480
<i>living at the bottom of Lake Inokashira,</i>

573
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:22,232
<i>and their queen fell in love</i>
<i>with a yakuza gangster</i>

574
00:32:22,316 --> 00:32:24,401
<i>and gave birth to a son</i>

575
00:32:24,485 --> 00:32:27,196
<i>who grew up to become</i>
<i>ruler of the aquatic race</i>

576
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,698
<i>and a yakuza lieutenant as well?</i>

577
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:31,575
I feel like you cut that short.

578
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:34,036
<i>What if a low-level yakuza thug</i>

579
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,705
<i>got struck by lightning</i>
<i>while in a hot spring,</i>

580
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:40,584
<i>and obtained the ability to run</i>
<i>even faster than a thunderbolt?</i>

581
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:46,048
<i>What if a gambler found herself</i>
<i>in trouble and on the run,</i>

582
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:49,218
<i>and just so happened to stumble</i>
<i>across a hidden power ring</i>

583
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:50,928
<i>and its energy supply?</i>

584
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:57,476
<i>By folding and overlapping</i>
<i>all these various scenarios,</i>

585
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:01,605
<i>one can form them into an</i>
<i>entirely new thing altogether,</i>

586
00:33:01,689 --> 00:33:05,484
<i>like shaping a crane out of</i>
<i>a single sheet of paper.</i>

587
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:08,654
<i>The Four-Dimensional Origami System...</i>

588
00:33:09,405 --> 00:33:13,992
That is what I have chosen
to call my brilliant new device.

589
00:33:14,702 --> 00:33:18,664
Now there is a country ruled
entirely by violent gangsters,

590
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:21,375
my very own army of assassins.

591
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:24,378
All I have to do is send them
to attack Amatsukuni,

592
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:27,464
and the earth will be rid
of the plague of humanity.

593
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:29,258
It's beautifully ironic.

594
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:32,803
It won't be the Justice League
but a Yakuza League

595
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:35,806
that will restore peace
and harmony back to the world.

596
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:37,766
Rather amusing,

597
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,101
wouldn't you say?

598
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,812
Sounds like you went to
a whole lot of trouble, Grandpa.

599
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:43,480
Does my mom know about this?

600
00:33:43,564 --> 00:33:44,815
Talia?

601
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:47,359
She has no part in any of this, no.

602
00:33:47,443 --> 00:33:49,778
It's my plan, and mine alone.

603
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:53,449
So then, Damian,
all you have to do is ask

604
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:56,452
and I will gladly hand over
my rule to you.

605
00:33:57,369 --> 00:34:00,873
I was sure to make the inflection point
where history changed

606
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:03,959
a month prior to your return
from feudal Japan.

607
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,128
Everything is in place.

608
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:08,338
The order can be given at any time,

609
00:34:08,422 --> 00:34:12,342
and the yakuza of these lands
will lead a purge of the old world.

610
00:34:12,843 --> 00:34:15,471
You want me to be like
your successor or something?

611
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:17,264
Yeah, that's a hard pass.

612
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,558
Still not interested, are you?

613
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:22,144
This is a wonderful opportunity.

614
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:23,812
Such a waste.

615
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:26,482
You can ask all you want,
but I'm not changing my mind.

616
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:28,233
And, like,
what are we even doing here

617
00:34:28,317 --> 00:34:31,069
if none of your big master plan
involves sushi?

618
00:34:31,153 --> 00:34:33,822
I don't get why you feel like you
have to put on some dramatic show

619
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:35,449
to get your point across.

620
00:34:35,616 --> 00:34:37,159
I just like the sushi here

621
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:40,496
and thought it would be nice
for you to experience a little culture,

622
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:43,373
but all you ate were
those awful California rolls,

623
00:34:43,457 --> 00:34:44,958
disgusting pig vomit.

624
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:47,544
Well, my taste buds say,
"Screw you, old man."

625
00:34:47,628 --> 00:34:49,838
Alright, we are done here.

626
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,342
Aah!

627
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:01,183
Aah!

628
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:02,601
Mm-hmm.

629
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:08,732
This seaweed reeks!

630
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:11,902
You just stay there
and watch my yakuza army

631
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:14,279
cleanse the world
of all the human filth.

632
00:35:14,822 --> 00:35:17,616
Feel free to enjoy some California rolls
while you're at it.

633
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:20,118
You are seriously
like the worst grandpa ever!

634
00:35:21,537 --> 00:35:23,539
Hold up.
So you're saying it was The Joker

635
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,040
who actually saved your butt?

636
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,750
It's never simple with him.

637
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:29,169
I'm sure it must be part
of some bigger scheme.

638
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:31,964
Well, we can't just let
him run loose, can we?

639
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:35,175
No, but dealing with the
yakuza takes priority right now.

640
00:35:35,259 --> 00:35:37,553
Especially given
who's behind all this.

641
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,137
Ra's is insane.

642
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:42,266
So we have yakuza versions
of Superman,

643
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:44,977
Green Lantern, Aquaman, and Flash?

644
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,229
While I'm glad
Wonder Woman is on our side,

645
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:48,647
it still won't be easy.

646
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:49,648
Wrong.

647
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:51,692
This should be a simple win.

648
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:54,611
We already know the extent
of their abilities better than anyone.

649
00:35:54,695 --> 00:35:55,696
So what?

650
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:59,032
The Yakuza League is like the
proverbial frog born in a well.

651
00:35:59,116 --> 00:36:01,493
They know nothing outside
the world in which they live.

652
00:36:01,577 --> 00:36:04,079
They lack practical combat experience,

653
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,498
and that's a weakness
we can take advantage of.

654
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:08,333
I get it.

655
00:36:08,417 --> 00:36:10,002
They don't know what it's like to fight

656
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:12,296
against the most cunning badass
of all time.

657
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:15,215
At the time when
we returned from feudal Japan,

658
00:36:15,299 --> 00:36:18,594
we were exposed to an energy,
a space-time pulse,

659
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:21,013
that was being emitted
from the Quake Engine.

660
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:24,516
That's why we can see Japan
in the sky,

661
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,895
as well as travel safely through
the fissure in space-time.

662
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:30,772
And the same goes for whatever
we're holding on to as well.

663
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:34,568
Which means we can take all of
our Bat-gear with us to Yakuza Land, too.

664
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:36,236
I like the sound of that.

665
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,739
I have something prepared
for you, gentlemen.

666
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:52,294
{\an8}<i>♪ Did you see that?</i>

00:37:36,338 --> 00:37:38,715
I do hope you enjoyed
my presentation.

678
00:37:38,799 --> 00:37:41,593
Yes, um... thank you, Alfred.

679
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:45,847
Huh? Hmm.

680
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:51,979
Fine job extinguishing
the Doomuzu-gumi.

681
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:54,356
It was hardly a challenge at all.

682
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,233
That leaves the Amazone Family.

683
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:58,151
She is the only one among you

684
00:37:58,235 --> 00:38:01,530
who failed to embrace the
yakuza's ruthless way of life.

685
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:03,532
Perhaps overlapping
the different dimensions

686
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:05,617
didn't go as smoothly as I thought.

687
00:38:05,701 --> 00:38:07,619
She's been a thorn in our side.

688
00:38:07,703 --> 00:38:08,870
I'll deal with her.

689
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:10,622
Yes...

690
00:38:10,706 --> 00:38:13,625
and once Hinomoto is brought
under a single banner,

691
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:16,003
next will be Amatsukuni.

692
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:21,258
Invading and conquering the
obnoxious blight in our skies

693
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:23,218
should be quick work for you.

694
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:28,724
Yesterday, some of the yakuza
from Amatsukuni stirred up trouble.

695
00:38:29,016 --> 00:38:32,602
They were dressed in ridiculous
bat and clown outfits.

696
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:33,812
Judging by their actions,

697
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:37,149
they are nothing but fools
with no respect for our ways.

698
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:39,026
As you have said,

699
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:42,320
leaving them alive will not prove useful
to us in any way.

700
00:38:42,404 --> 00:38:43,947
Exactly right.

701
00:38:44,031 --> 00:38:47,200
And also, you said
their world is like ours,

702
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:49,536
filled with a rabble
of yakuza thugs?

703
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:53,373
- Yes.
- Then I will crush them without mercy.

704
00:38:53,457 --> 00:38:56,168
The weak shall perish
and the strong thrive

705
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:58,879
as the rule of all yakuza rings true.

706
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:00,714
I trust you will not fail.

707
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:02,924
Rest assured Amatsukuni
will crumble

708
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:05,761
and fall under a hailstorm
of our warriors.

709
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:07,220
Then see to it.

710
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,264
- Ubu.
- Yes, sir.

711
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,891
- The sushi.
- Hm!

712
00:39:11,475 --> 00:39:13,935
Make sure Bari has a full stomach.

713
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:16,063
He'll be happy with that.

714
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:25,072
My lady, may I have a moment?

715
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:28,241
Quietly, please.
Our guest is still asleep.

716
00:39:28,325 --> 00:39:30,410
There is a turtle at the gates.

717
00:39:30,494 --> 00:39:31,995
A turtle?

718
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,163
Right.

719
00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:37,959
{\an8}An oracle bone script.

720
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:40,796
{\an8}Such an antiquated way
of sending a message.

721
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,507
Ma'am,
it's from the aquatic people.

722
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:46,426
Very well.

723
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,553
Tell Ahsa I accept the request.

724
00:39:57,354 --> 00:39:59,731
I have been challenged to a duel.

725
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:02,859
Ahsa the Aqua Dragon
wants to settle things.

726
00:40:20,836 --> 00:40:25,215
{\an8}<i>♪ Suppose that there</i>
<i>were no tears in this world ♪</i>

727

H-Hey!

739
00:41:38,205 --> 00:41:41,208
I thought I was clear
when I said one-on-one.

740
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:42,876
She is here to be a witness.

741
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:43,877
{\an8}Aw.

742
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:49,591
{\an8}Daiana, I will first ask if you'd agree
to join the Hagane Family.

743
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:51,509
We've known each other
since we were young.

744
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:53,053
I can put in a good word for you.

745
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:54,888
You two were friendsies?

746
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:58,016
We once played together
in the waters of Lake Inokashira.

747
00:41:58,099 --> 00:41:59,559
I don't want to hurt you.

748
00:41:59,643 --> 00:42:01,895
Oh, don't flatter yourself.

749
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:04,940
How did you get dragged
into this yakuza mess, anyway?

750
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:08,276
The Great Oyabun of your gang
is from Amatsukuni.

751
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:11,488
I hope it was worth
throwing away your pride.

752
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:13,281
I want to rule...

753
00:42:13,907 --> 00:42:15,992
the skyward sea.

754
00:42:16,076 --> 00:42:17,369
The sea?

755
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:18,995
It's a strange thing.

756
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:22,582
I've known nothing but
the waters of this lake my whole life,

757
00:42:22,666 --> 00:42:27,420
but whenever I look up to the sea,
it feeds a fire deep within my soul.

758
00:42:27,504 --> 00:42:29,756
As though there's
another world out there,

759
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:32,968
one where I live
as king of the great ocean.

760
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:35,804
There are days it's all I think about.

761
00:42:35,971 --> 00:42:38,890
I will make that sea my territory.

762
00:42:38,974 --> 00:42:43,311
And to have it, I will submit
to Ra's as Great Oyabun.

763
00:42:43,395 --> 00:42:47,649
Ahsa, you act as though
you're some pillar of society,

764
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:50,026
but that's just your ego talking.

765
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:52,529
Living underwater
has swollen your head.

766
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:56,366
I'd expect you
to say something like that.

767
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,788
Hmm?

768
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:13,550
Huh?

769
00:43:17,012 --> 00:43:18,430
Don't you worry.

770
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:20,974
I'll drain that big head of yours.

771
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:23,143
You're so cool!

772
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:25,061
You're out of your depth!

773
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:26,271
Huh!

774
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:30,025
Hyah!

775
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:34,487
Prepare to meet your maker, Ahsa!

776
00:43:38,575 --> 00:43:40,035
Huh?

777
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:43,872
You've got some real fight
in you, Daiana.

778
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:45,457
My girls!

779
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:47,917
Zeshika...

780
00:43:48,001 --> 00:43:49,753
There's no way that Daiana,

781
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:52,255
the surrogate mommy
with the heart of gold,

782
00:43:52,339 --> 00:43:54,924
can just sit back and
watch her precious children die.

783
00:43:55,008 --> 00:43:56,843
Forget about us!
Destroy her, Oyabun!

784
00:43:56,968 --> 00:43:59,012
- Keep fighting! Take her down!
- We're here for you!

785
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:00,930
- Pay us no mind!
- Well, if <i>you</i> guys

786
00:44:01,014 --> 00:44:02,640
aren't gonna fight fair,

787
00:44:02,724 --> 00:44:04,809
then you won't mind
if I join in too.

788
00:44:07,062 --> 00:44:08,021
Bleh!

789
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:09,731
Hyah!

790
00:44:10,023 --> 00:44:11,941
I have a duty
to see this through,

791
00:44:12,025 --> 00:44:14,444
so please forgive me, ladies.

792
00:44:17,447 --> 00:44:18,531
Aah!

793
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:27,040
Hyah!

794
00:44:31,378 --> 00:44:35,507
Hmph. You haven't changed at all
since you were a kid, have you?

795
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,967
Even if you think
you've got it all figured out,

796
00:44:38,051 --> 00:44:40,178
there is still doubt in your heart.

797
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:43,640
You're not the man you once were.

798
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:47,977
It's time
to say your prayers, Daiana.

799
00:44:48,061 --> 00:44:50,397
Hyah! Hee!

800
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,649
Jumpity-jump, jumpity-jump,
jumpity-jump, jumpity-jump!

801
00:44:52,732 --> 00:44:55,068
Quit jump-jump-jumping
all over the place!

802
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:57,362
Now feel my fury!

803
00:44:57,445 --> 00:45:01,032
Kanzashi Fl--

804
00:45:04,828 --> 00:45:07,080
Hello!

805
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:09,833
Kanzashi Flasher!

806
00:45:14,504 --> 00:45:17,132
- Nightwing, you take Zeshika.
- I'm on it.

807
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:20,552
Red Hood, Red Robin,
you two head for the Yakuza Tower.

808
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:22,053
- Got it.
- Roger that.

809
00:45:31,938 --> 00:45:33,815
Wahoo!

810
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:35,150
Splash!

811
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:43,491
I'm glad we made it in time.

812
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,910
You came back.

813
00:45:45,994 --> 00:45:48,496
Ha!

814
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:51,166
Huh? Aah!

815
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:55,003
When the hell did you do that?!

816
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:58,298
{\an8}

817
00:46:05,472 --> 00:46:07,640
Aah! Oof!

818
00:46:19,861 --> 00:46:22,655
I have sent Doomuzu Deio to his death!

819
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:26,701
The Hagane-gumi ended
Yakuzageddon as victors!

820
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:31,623
Now it's time to extend our rule
by taking control of Amatsukuni.

821
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:34,959
You will find no one
more ruthless than us.

822
00:46:35,043 --> 00:46:39,255
You will eradicate these intruders
with the full force of our strength.

823
00:46:39,339 --> 00:46:40,882
Teach them a lesson!

824
00:46:41,216 --> 00:46:44,010
The Hagane-gumi reigns over all.

825
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:46,429
We have nothing to fear!

826
00:46:46,513 --> 00:46:50,308
Hunt down every last piece
of trash from Amatsukuni,

827
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:53,186
and crush their very spines!

828
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:58,608
You're a fool!

829
00:46:58,691 --> 00:47:01,236
Fighting me under water
is a death sentence!

830
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:02,529
Hyah!

831
00:47:08,576 --> 00:47:10,245
You can't defeat me!

832
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:13,122
Take this!

833
00:47:13,206 --> 00:47:16,626
Dice of Hell, The Devil's Bones!

834
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:17,794
Ha!

835
00:47:20,964 --> 00:47:21,965
Ha!

836
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:35,311
Yeah!

837
00:47:38,106 --> 00:47:41,192
The operation to take over
Amatsukuni has begun!

838
00:47:41,276 --> 00:47:43,945
You are all ammunition! Bullets!

839
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:45,697
Right!

840
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:47,991
<i>What the heck is that?</i>

841
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:49,826
You can fly?!

842
00:47:56,291 --> 00:47:59,335
Oof! Gah!

843
00:47:59,419 --> 00:48:00,753
- Huh?
- Hyah!

844
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:07,260
Come on! Don't tell me
you're already done.

845
00:48:07,343 --> 00:48:08,803
'Kay, funny man.

846
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:11,723
You are going to regret
getting cocky with me.

847
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:14,058
Nobody can beat me under the waves!

848
00:48:14,142 --> 00:48:18,271
The water is my home,
and it's always on my side!

849
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:21,733
I wouldn't be so sure.

850
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:24,277
Huh? Oh?

851
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,903
Aah!

852
00:48:25,987 --> 00:48:27,780
That's an ultrasonic shield.

853
00:48:27,864 --> 00:48:29,574
You're not going anywhere.

854
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:42,253
Gah! Aah!

855
00:48:42,337 --> 00:48:43,921
Bad idea!

856
00:48:45,715 --> 00:48:46,841
Gah!

857
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,386
- Aah!
- This fight is over!

858
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:51,512
Aah!

859
00:48:51,596 --> 00:48:52,930
Don't you get it?

860
00:48:53,014 --> 00:48:56,267
This is what happens when you face
the might of the Emerald Ray.

861
00:48:57,894 --> 00:48:59,312
{\an8}- Hey.
Huh?

862
00:48:59,395 --> 00:49:02,774
{\an8}Science Ninja Technique: Decoy Body.

863
00:49:02,857 --> 00:49:04,275
When did you do that?

864
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:06,569
I was never inside to begin with.

865
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:11,991
Hm.

866
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:13,910
Sweet dreams.

867
00:49:14,744 --> 00:49:19,290
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

868
00:49:32,095 --> 00:49:34,972
You can't hold me!

869
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:41,479
Hm?

870
00:49:48,069 --> 00:49:49,404
Daiana!

871
00:49:50,405 --> 00:49:52,198
Damn you!

872
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:56,119
Ahsa, I believe you said
the water is always on your side,

873
00:49:56,202 --> 00:49:58,454
but the tide can be turned
against you.

874
00:49:58,538 --> 00:49:59,497
What?!

875
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:03,459
Running electric currents through water
splits it into hydrogen and oxygen.

876
00:50:03,543 --> 00:50:06,254
Aah!

877
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,966
And when you recombine
the two again,

878
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:12,260
they can become highly explosive.

879
00:50:15,096 --> 00:50:16,681
{\an8}

880
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:19,726
{\an8}Science Ninja Technique:
Electrolysis.

881
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,563
Take it from me,
there is no bigger threat

882
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:25,815
than having a friend turn foe.

883
00:50:31,112 --> 00:50:33,906
Thanks for getting me
out of that sticky situation.

884
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:36,284
Same to you. I appreciate it.

885
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:38,953
I am grateful you returned
with your henchmen.

886
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:40,997
They seem very capable.

887
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:44,167
Since the Hagane-ikka launched
an attack on my family,

888
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:46,043
it means that they must be ready

889
00:50:46,127 --> 00:50:48,963
to unleash their full-scale invasion
on Amatsukuni.

890
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:49,964
As I thought.

891
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:52,258
That's precisely why we came here.

892
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:53,926
- Batman.
- Huh?

893
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:55,762
We found the Quake Engine.

894
00:50:55,845 --> 00:50:57,764
It's in the heart
of the Yakuza Tower.

895
00:50:57,847 --> 00:50:59,766
What is the Quake Engine?

896
00:50:59,849 --> 00:51:01,851
It's a machine that's
been keeping this country stable

897
00:51:01,934 --> 00:51:04,604
by connecting it
to an interdimensional fissure.

898
00:51:04,771 --> 00:51:06,647
But once we destroy it,

899
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:09,776
Hinomoto should go back to being
part of its original world.

900
00:51:09,859 --> 00:51:12,403
So you're saying
it's something like an anchor,

901
00:51:12,487 --> 00:51:14,447
and once we cut it loose,
we're free?

902
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:15,948
That about sums it up.

903
00:51:16,032 --> 00:51:17,116
Huh?

904
00:51:22,705 --> 00:51:24,832
- Nightwing, let's get moving.
- Right.

905
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:26,334
I'm going with you.

906
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:29,796
I'm a native of Hinomoto,
and we should clean up our own mess.

907
00:51:29,879 --> 00:51:32,340
That is exactly what
I'd expect from you.

908
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:35,426
Yeah, you're not too different
from the person I know.

909
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:38,221
The one called Wonder Woman, right?

910
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:40,515
Robin mentioned her before.

911
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:42,433
Yes. That's correct.

912
00:51:42,892 --> 00:51:45,353
I've always had this feeling
that I wasn't alone,

913
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:48,481
that there was someone like me
out there somewhere.

914
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:50,775
Ahsa seemed to share
the same sentiment.

915
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:53,486
- Yeah?
- I shall not bring shame to her

916
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:55,780
by living below her standards.

917
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:58,825
Perhaps she's the reason
I protect the Ninkyo

918
00:51:58,908 --> 00:52:01,327
and why I keep its spirit alive.

919
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:03,246
I wouldn't worry about that.

920
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:06,082
You're exactly how
you should be, wherever you are.

921
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:07,333
Hop on in.

922
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:08,543
No.

923
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:10,503
I tend to get carsick.

924
00:52:10,586 --> 00:52:11,629
Ha!

925
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:13,840
Huh. Go figure.

926
00:52:13,923 --> 00:52:14,882
Let's go.

927
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,638
Within the ranks
of the Japanese yakuza

928
00:52:20,721 --> 00:52:25,309
are sacrificial assassins sent to kill
the bosses of rival syndicates.

929
00:52:25,393 --> 00:52:27,395
They are like human bullets.

930
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:33,192
And now those men will quite literally
be fired straight into Gotham,

931
00:52:33,276 --> 00:52:35,486
willing to pay the ultimate price.

932
00:52:38,197 --> 00:52:39,782
Alright!

933
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,702
Now give 'em hell!

934
00:52:53,713 --> 00:52:55,882
Huh? This is so dumb.

935
00:52:55,965 --> 00:52:58,050
You guys are
out of your damn minds.

936
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:04,724
It's like a damn Yakuza Tornado,
and it's about to hit Gotham!

937
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:06,475
Very good.
It's building up from the ground,

938
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:08,477
just like a <i>real</i> tornado.

939
00:53:08,561 --> 00:53:09,979
Not like a downburst.

940
00:53:10,062 --> 00:53:10,980
Huh?

941
00:53:11,063 --> 00:53:12,648
There seemed to be
some confusion earlier.

942
00:53:12,732 --> 00:53:14,650
What are you, a weatherman?
We gotta stop it.

943
00:53:14,734 --> 00:53:16,152
Yeah, yeah. Hang on.

944
00:53:19,655 --> 00:53:22,575
We need to amplify the
space-time pulse that's within us

945
00:53:22,658 --> 00:53:25,286
and block the Speed Force
from crossing dimensions.

946
00:53:26,621 --> 00:53:30,166
{\an8}Science Ninja Technique:
Tornado Canceler!

947
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:47,016
Oyabun!

948
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:49,310
Those jerks from Amatsukuni
are attacking!

949
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:51,687
Do they think
we're screwing around?

950
00:53:51,771 --> 00:53:53,522
Beat them to a bloody pulp!

951
00:53:53,606 --> 00:53:54,607
Yes, sir!

952
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:58,277
Come, Detective, meet your end.

953
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:05,576
Bat-Phoenix,
going into cloaking mode.

954
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:21,968
Step on it, Jason.

955
00:54:22,051 --> 00:54:23,260
Alright!

956
00:54:23,344 --> 00:54:25,680
Get back here, now!

957
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:29,266
Here comes our boy!
Flash in a funny hat!

958
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:32,228
Why don't you stop talking
and focus?

959
00:54:32,311 --> 00:54:33,187
Ha!

960
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:36,649
Hyah!

961
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:39,402
You won't get away from me
that easily!

962
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:41,028
Yeah? We'll see.

963
00:54:45,908 --> 00:54:47,743
Okay, that's not bad.

964
00:54:47,827 --> 00:54:49,829
But watch this!

965
00:54:50,413 --> 00:54:51,455
Ha!

966
00:54:51,998 --> 00:54:53,791
Hyah!

967
00:54:55,251 --> 00:54:57,628
Huh? Huh? Hyah!

968
00:54:57,712 --> 00:55:00,589
You may be the fastest man alive,
but you're still a man.

969
00:55:05,344 --> 00:55:06,345
Huh?

970
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:08,723
Hmph.

971
00:55:08,806 --> 00:55:09,724
What?!

972
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:13,185
I don't think so.
I ain't falling for that again!

973
00:55:15,354 --> 00:55:17,023
Then try <i>this</i> on for size!

974
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:22,403
{\an8}Try again!

975
00:55:26,073 --> 00:55:28,909
Hyah!

976
00:55:31,871 --> 00:55:33,247
<i>Tim!</i>

977
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,331
<i>Go that way!</i>

978
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:36,751
Huh?

979
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:38,961
Hyah!

980
00:55:45,134 --> 00:55:46,427
Aah!

981
00:55:54,226 --> 00:55:57,438
That's not good.
We can't fit on the road!

982
00:55:57,521 --> 00:55:59,774
No, check this out!

983
00:56:05,613 --> 00:56:07,239
Hyah!

984
00:56:09,325 --> 00:56:11,827
You won't escape. Hyah!

985
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:15,331
Hyah!

986
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:18,084
Damn it!

987
00:56:20,461 --> 00:56:21,670
<i>No way!</i>

988
00:56:21,754 --> 00:56:24,006
<i>I should be faster</i>
<i>than these chumps</i>

989
00:56:24,298 --> 00:56:27,176
<i>because nobody beats</i>
<i>the fastest man in the world.</i>

990
00:56:29,804 --> 00:56:32,765
Nobody beats me!

991
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:37,853
Huh?

992
00:56:39,855 --> 00:56:42,191
That's not possible!

993
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:48,697
Huh?

994
00:56:51,951 --> 00:56:56,455
What...
the hell is this?!

995
00:56:56,872 --> 00:56:59,375
You dare pull this kind of crap
with me?

996
00:57:00,835 --> 00:57:02,336
I am done screwing around!

997
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:04,421
You hear me?
You and your cheap tricks.

998
00:57:04,505 --> 00:57:07,675
I hate your stupid city
and all you losers!

999
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:14,431
Bunch of damn punks.

1000
00:57:14,515 --> 00:57:16,559
I'll run them down
and pull their guts out

1001
00:57:16,642 --> 00:57:18,394
and throw 'em in the in the street.

1002
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:20,354
Just wait, you little turds.

1003
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:23,440
Huh?

1004
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:25,776
{\an8}

1005
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:29,655
{\an8}Science Ninja Technique:
Vending Machine.

1006
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:33,075
{\an8}After running
at such high speeds for a while,

1007
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:36,120
you're bound to get hungry
and thirsty...

1008
00:57:36,203 --> 00:57:38,205
like any man would.

1009
00:57:38,289 --> 00:57:40,416
Enjoy your nap time.

1010
00:57:46,172 --> 00:57:48,007
It went off without a hitch.

1011
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:49,717
Way to go, Jason.

1012
00:57:52,136 --> 00:57:54,638
You know, this
doesn't really feel like a win.

1013
00:57:54,722 --> 00:57:55,931
Aw, come on.

1014
00:57:56,307 --> 00:57:58,142
You know this would
have been much more difficult

1015
00:57:58,225 --> 00:58:00,144
if that were the real Flash.

1016
00:58:16,202 --> 00:58:19,121
Now that is a super huge problem.

1017
00:58:23,292 --> 00:58:26,462
You've got some guts to make
a mockery of my henchmen,

1018
00:58:26,921 --> 00:58:29,548
but it's the last thing you'll do.

1019
00:58:34,345 --> 00:58:35,471
Hmph!

1020
00:58:36,597 --> 00:58:38,182
You must be joking.

1021
00:58:48,734 --> 00:58:50,236
Ha!

1022
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:52,988
Hyah!

1023
00:58:58,661 --> 00:59:00,287
Huh? Aah!

1024
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:16,887
You cannot win.

1025
00:59:17,096 --> 00:59:19,139
You are going to pay
for defying us

1026
00:59:19,223 --> 00:59:21,892
by spending the rest
of your lives in pain.

1027
00:59:22,935 --> 00:59:25,896
Ah!

1028
00:59:27,356 --> 00:59:29,942
Child's play.

1029
00:59:30,025 --> 00:59:31,944
Hmm?

1030
00:59:36,448 --> 00:59:37,825
Hmph.

1031
00:59:39,368 --> 00:59:42,788
It's about time you showed up,
bat fiend.

1032
00:59:44,123 --> 00:59:46,417
I'm here to get Robin back.

1033
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,794
I'm sure you love your son.

1034
00:59:49,295 --> 00:59:52,715
Sadly, your other sidekicks
are already dead.

1035
00:59:53,549 --> 00:59:54,425
Hm?

1036
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:59,638
I've got bad news for you, Kuraku.

1037
00:59:59,722 --> 01:00:01,098
Daiana.

1038
01:00:02,141 --> 01:00:03,684
Ahsa...

1039
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:07,062
I should have known he wouldn't
be able to handle the job.

1040
01:00:09,898 --> 01:00:10,816
Get in!

1041
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:13,736
All of you, go to secure the
Quake Engine and find Robin.

1042
01:00:13,819 --> 01:00:14,945
Come on!

1043
01:00:22,745 --> 01:00:24,371
Hyah!

1044
01:00:37,718 --> 01:00:39,887
Zeshika has been defeated.

1045
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:42,931
You're the only member
of the Hagane Family standing.

1046
01:00:43,015 --> 01:00:46,769
Yes, well, that is hardly a problem.

1047
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:49,355
Not with me around.

1048
01:00:51,732 --> 01:00:52,691
Ha!

1049
01:00:58,113 --> 01:01:00,324
I am the Man of Steel,

1050
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:02,284
master of the underworld.

1051
01:01:02,368 --> 01:01:05,162
Kuraku will show you no mercy!

1052
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:12,669
And as long as I live,
the Hagane-gumi will never die!

1053
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:20,886
All of Hinomoto and Amatsukuni
will both be under my control.

1054
01:01:20,969 --> 01:01:23,055
Hm!

1055
01:01:23,138 --> 01:01:24,807
The power you wield,

1056
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:27,267
why do you not use it
to help other people?

1057
01:01:27,351 --> 01:01:29,269
To help others?

1058
01:01:29,353 --> 01:01:30,979
That's what I'm doing.

1059
01:01:31,063 --> 01:01:33,357
This is humanity's true nature.

1060
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:35,609
They have a desire
to hurt each other

1061
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:38,070
and rule from the moment of birth.

1062
01:01:38,445 --> 01:01:42,616
The only way to govern this world
is to suppress their evil tendencies

1063
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:45,244
with an even greater evil!

1064
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:48,956
Hm?

1065
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:50,040
Aah!

1066
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:19,153
Daiana, you should
head for Yakuza Tower, too.

1067
01:02:19,236 --> 01:02:20,112
Yes, but--

1068
01:02:20,195 --> 01:02:23,323
Stopping the Quake Engine
is our top priority right now.

1069
01:02:23,407 --> 01:02:25,701
I'll handle things here myself.

1070
01:02:28,287 --> 01:02:30,998
You think all that fancy machinery

1071
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:33,208
will be enough to stop me?

1072
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:38,672
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

1073
01:02:52,144 --> 01:02:53,854
This is where the Quake Engine is.

1074
01:02:53,937 --> 01:02:55,397
Can we take the elevator?

1075
01:02:55,481 --> 01:02:57,149
They could just stop it
and screw us over.

1076
01:02:57,232 --> 01:02:58,942
We can run up the stairs.

1077
01:02:59,026 --> 01:03:00,611
Oh, yay.

1078
01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:09,828
Aah!

1079
01:03:12,748 --> 01:03:13,624
Hyah!

1080
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:18,587
Hyah!

1081
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:21,215
Aah!

1082
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:43,946
So much for your little toy.

1083
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,909
I knew you were
nothing more than a fraud.

1084
01:03:49,076 --> 01:03:50,744
There's only one fraud here,

1085
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:53,038
and that would be you.

1086
01:03:58,877 --> 01:04:00,045
Hmph.

1087
01:04:00,128 --> 01:04:01,255
Die.

1088
01:04:01,338 --> 01:04:02,422
Ha!

1089
01:04:03,257 --> 01:04:05,467
What's wrong?

1090
01:04:05,926 --> 01:04:07,594
Got something in your eye?

1091
01:04:09,972 --> 01:04:11,265
Hya--

1092
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:13,433
What?!

1093
01:04:15,644 --> 01:04:16,603
Aah!

1094
01:04:28,991 --> 01:04:30,284
What'd you do?

1095
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:31,910
You're not from here.

1096
01:04:31,994 --> 01:04:34,329
You were born
on a different planet.

1097
01:04:34,413 --> 01:04:36,540
The only way you have
such incredible powers

1098
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:39,209
is when you're exposed
to the sun rays here on Earth,

1099
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:42,713
your superhuman strength
and your body of steel,

1100
01:04:42,796 --> 01:04:44,715
your power to fly,

1101
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:48,051
and your ability to shoot
heat vision from your eyes.

1102
01:04:48,135 --> 01:04:49,303
However...

1103
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:54,099
when exposed to the red sun rays
from your birth planet,

1104
01:04:54,224 --> 01:04:57,686
then you become just like
any other normal human being.

1105
01:04:57,769 --> 01:04:59,646
That's not possible.

1106
01:04:59,938 --> 01:05:00,939
Hm?

1107
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:05,527
Huh?

1108
01:05:05,694 --> 01:05:07,321
You did this?

1109
01:05:10,532 --> 01:05:14,453
Yes. That's right.
You didn't destroy my machine.

1110
01:05:14,536 --> 01:05:17,998
You helped me arrange it
into the proper positions.

1111
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:21,293
By configuring this collection
of crystals into a filter,

1112
01:05:21,376 --> 01:05:23,170
I turned the Earth's yellow sunlight

1113
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:27,215
into the exact same type of light
found on your birth planet.

1114
01:05:27,883 --> 01:05:31,720
Science Ninja Technique:
Spectral Conversion!

1115
01:05:31,803 --> 01:05:33,847
Damn you!

1116
01:05:43,148 --> 01:05:44,733
You feel that?

1117
01:05:44,816 --> 01:05:47,194
That's what we humans call pain.

1118
01:05:47,277 --> 01:05:48,820
You never knew what it felt like

1119
01:05:48,904 --> 01:05:51,114
because you've always
lived with incredible strength.

1120
01:05:51,198 --> 01:05:52,741
Hurts, doesn't it?

1121
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:56,662
This is the pain of all the people
you're trying to tyrannize.

1122
01:05:56,745 --> 01:05:59,581
Everyone living normal lives
in Amatsukuni.

1123
01:06:02,668 --> 01:06:03,585
Normal?

1124
01:06:03,669 --> 01:06:06,004
There's nothing normal
about the yakuza.

1125
01:06:06,088 --> 01:06:07,172
Yakuza?

1126
01:06:07,255 --> 01:06:08,632
Yeah, that's right!

1127
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:11,802
I know that Amatsukuni
is the same as Hinomoto.

1128
01:06:11,885 --> 01:06:14,471
It's filled with nothing but yakuza.

1129
01:06:14,638 --> 01:06:17,307
Unbelievable.

1130
01:06:17,391 --> 01:06:20,769
You never gave a second thought
to all that crap Ra's al Ghul fed you.

1131
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:22,729
You mean he lied?

1132
01:06:22,813 --> 01:06:26,191
Most people living in
Amatsukuni are average citizens.

1133
01:06:26,525 --> 01:06:29,653
{\an8}Or as a friend once put it,
"good, honest people."

1134
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,948
{\an8}The whole reason I fight
is to protect those people

1135
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:34,950
{\an8}from criminals like the yakuza.

1136
01:06:35,367 --> 01:06:38,537
You don't expect me to
believe that nonsense, do you?

1137
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:41,373
Oh, no, you don't have to
take my word for it.

1138
01:06:41,456 --> 01:06:43,542
Your arrogance will be your end!

1139
01:06:51,508 --> 01:06:54,344
Is that all you've got, Kuraku?

1140
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,770
What's the matter?
Are you afraid of me?

1141
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:08,024
I know a man who is
remarkably similar to you.

1142
01:07:08,108 --> 01:07:09,526
Except...

1143
01:07:09,609 --> 01:07:14,573
losing his superpowers wasn't enough
to stop him from having a heart of steel.

1144
01:07:14,656 --> 01:07:16,783
He kept on fighting
through sheer willpower

1145
01:07:16,867 --> 01:07:19,619
and did whatever it took to save lives.

1146
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:24,875
If I'm enough to strike fear in you,
then you're nothing compared to him.

1147
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:27,085
And you never will be.

1148
01:07:27,169 --> 01:07:28,754
You'll never amount to anything.

1149
01:07:28,837 --> 01:07:30,130
Ha!

1150
01:07:39,806 --> 01:07:41,391
They're back.

1151
01:07:41,475 --> 01:07:45,020
I can feel all my powers
returning to me.

1152
01:07:45,103 --> 01:07:49,024
Now I'm going to make you regret
ever talking to me like that.

1153
01:07:49,107 --> 01:07:50,025
Die!

1154
01:07:50,108 --> 01:07:51,526
Just as expected.

1155
01:07:53,487 --> 01:07:55,113
Hyah!

1156
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:15,258
Kryptonite!

1157
01:08:15,342 --> 01:08:16,510
Your weakness.

1158
01:08:16,593 --> 01:08:19,971
It nullifies the powers
of Kryptonians like you.

1159
01:08:20,305 --> 01:08:23,892
This was entrusted to me by
the very man I told you about.

1160
01:08:24,267 --> 01:08:25,852
<i>He wanted me to use it to stop him</i>

1161
01:08:25,936 --> 01:08:28,939
<i>if he ever lost control</i>
<i>and went on a rampage.</i>

1162
01:08:30,315 --> 01:08:33,151
You two may look the same
on the outside,

1163
01:08:33,235 --> 01:08:37,197
but you don't even have a fraction
of his pride or his heart.

1164
01:08:50,544 --> 01:08:53,171
I'm coming for you next, Ra's.

1165
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:59,469
I never expected Kuraku to lose.

1166
01:09:18,029 --> 01:09:19,239
Hm.

1167
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:21,575
Hm.

1168
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,046
Wha--

1169
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:44,681
Aw, man. This was supposed to be
my time to shine.

1170
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:47,684
Your father asked me
to come help you out.

1171
01:09:48,018 --> 01:09:50,061
Your friends are here as well.

1172
01:09:50,145 --> 01:09:51,980
Are they your older brothers?

1173
01:09:52,063 --> 01:09:53,481
You all look pretty similar.

1174
01:09:53,565 --> 01:09:54,941
You've got to be kidding.

1175
01:09:55,025 --> 01:09:56,860
They're just posers
who think they came first.

1176
01:10:01,615 --> 01:10:05,744
Ra's the Great Oyabun,
your family is finished.

1177
01:10:05,827 --> 01:10:08,455
The leader of the Bat Family
has defeated them all.

1178
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:10,540
Ha! Your big plan has failed,
Grandpa.

1179
01:10:10,624 --> 01:10:12,709
You won't be able to send
your stupid goons

1180
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:14,544
- over to Gotham anymore.
- Hm.

1181
01:10:14,878 --> 01:10:16,546
Very well, then.

1182
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:18,632
I guess it's time for plan B.

1183
01:10:23,762 --> 01:10:26,598
So glad you could make it,
Detective.

1184
01:10:26,681 --> 01:10:29,225
But once again,
you're a little too late.

1185
01:10:29,476 --> 01:10:31,186
He's got
the space-time converter.

1186
01:10:31,269 --> 01:10:32,312
What is that?

1187
01:10:32,395 --> 01:10:35,690
I can only guess it's the key part
of his time travel machine.

1188
01:11:00,215 --> 01:11:02,884
Dear God. What is that?

1189
01:11:08,473 --> 01:11:10,725
What have you done? Ra's?!

1190
01:11:10,809 --> 01:11:13,186
I deactivated the energy modulator,

1191
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:16,731
sending the Four-Dimensional
Origami System out of control.

1192
01:11:16,815 --> 01:11:19,734
Now nothing holds Hinomoto in place,

1193
01:11:19,818 --> 01:11:24,990
which will cause the Tokyo area
to rematerialize in the other world.

1194
01:11:25,323 --> 01:11:27,659
Gotham City will be crushed.

1195
01:11:27,742 --> 01:11:29,786
- Ra's, no!
- That is going to impact

1196
01:11:29,869 --> 01:11:31,287
far more than Gotham!

1197
01:11:31,371 --> 01:11:34,040
The shockwave alone
will bring a global disaster.

1198
01:11:34,499 --> 01:11:36,292
This cannot be what you want.

1199
01:11:36,376 --> 01:11:39,087
Oh, well, you don't need
to worry about a thing.

1200
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:42,173
The shockwave will
be absorbed within the fissure,

1201
01:11:42,257 --> 01:11:46,428
so it won't be like a meteor
or anything that exciting.

1202
01:11:46,761 --> 01:11:49,889
In fact, I would consider
it an improvement.

1203
01:11:49,973 --> 01:11:53,810
This nation of yakuza will purge
and purify all the rotten filth.

1204
01:11:53,893 --> 01:11:55,979
Eh, sounds kinda overboard
to me.

1205
01:11:56,062 --> 01:11:57,647
Hm! Ha!

1206
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:04,863
Hya--

1207
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:07,824
It's gone.

1208
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:10,118
Mm.

1209
01:12:10,535 --> 01:12:11,494
Batman!

1210
01:12:11,578 --> 01:12:13,121
Where's the Quake Engine?

1211
01:12:13,204 --> 01:12:15,874
Yeah, so, uh...
it sort of disappeared.

1212
01:12:15,957 --> 01:12:17,042
It did what?!

1213
01:12:17,125 --> 01:12:20,253
The Bat Family makes
its grand entrance.

1214
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:21,880
But unfortunately for you,

1215
01:12:21,963 --> 01:12:24,674
your superior numbers
make no difference here.

1216
01:12:25,091 --> 01:12:28,970
Since the Four-Dimensional
Origami System no longer has limits,

1217
01:12:29,054 --> 01:12:33,558
it is now operating while sliding through
multiple space-time continuums,

1218
01:12:33,683 --> 01:12:36,686
which means anyone
within this part of space-time

1219
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:38,313
won't even be able to touch it.

1220
01:12:38,396 --> 01:12:39,606
That can't be.

1221
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:41,900
What is this lunatic
even talking about?!

1222
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:44,694
It's like he's gambling
and cheating at the table.

1223
01:12:44,778 --> 01:12:46,863
He's hidden the dice that
are supposed to be in the cup,

1224
01:12:46,946 --> 01:12:49,157
and now nobody gets a roll.

1225
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:52,160
Ridiculous.
Then it's not even a game!

1226
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:54,079
Huh? Ah!

1227
01:12:54,162 --> 01:12:56,539
Yes, exactly.

1228
01:12:57,207 --> 01:13:00,418
I've no intention
of taking a gamble with you.

1229
01:13:01,586 --> 01:13:03,379
- Well, in that case...
- Huh?

1230
01:13:03,463 --> 01:13:04,964
- Huh?
- Hmm?

1231
01:13:05,048 --> 01:13:07,175
...then why don't I
do the gambling?

1232
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:13,181
There it is!

1233
01:13:13,264 --> 01:13:14,224
What?

1234
01:13:14,307 --> 01:13:16,768
Our bodies have been exposed
to a space-time pulse

1235
01:13:16,851 --> 01:13:19,062
emitted from the Quake Engine.

1236
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:22,690
It may be possible for us to
focus that energy on the device

1237
01:13:22,774 --> 01:13:27,195
as it fluctuates through space-time
and then anchor it to this continuum.

1238
01:13:27,529 --> 01:13:29,781
That's the gamble
I'm willing to take.

1239
01:13:29,864 --> 01:13:31,699
Sounds cool. I'm in!

1240
01:13:33,952 --> 01:13:35,161
We'll join, too!

1241
01:13:35,245 --> 01:13:36,496
No, you won't!

1242
01:13:37,664 --> 01:13:39,249
Hyah!

1243
01:13:43,962 --> 01:13:46,381
Get the space-time converter
away from him!

1244
01:13:46,464 --> 01:13:48,007
Consider it done.

1245
01:14:04,566 --> 01:14:05,608
Did it work?

1246
01:14:05,692 --> 01:14:08,653
Not yet. We need more energy.

1247
01:14:08,736 --> 01:14:10,029
Five of us isn't enough?

1248
01:14:31,509 --> 01:14:32,385
Huh?

1249
01:14:33,094 --> 01:14:34,512
Wha...

1250
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:40,852
How can that be?

1251
01:14:44,522 --> 01:14:49,319
<i>Losing his superpowers wasn't</i>
<i>enough to stop him from having a heart of steel.</i>

1252
01:14:49,402 --> 01:14:51,905
<i>He kept on fighting</i>
<i>through sheer willpower</i>

1253
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:54,574
<i>and did whatever it took</i>
<i>to save lives.</i>

1254
01:14:55,074 --> 01:14:59,996
<i>If I'm enough to strike fear in you,</i>
<i>then you're nothing compared to him.</i>

1255
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:02,832
<i>You'll never amount to anything.</i>

1256
01:15:09,714 --> 01:15:11,716
Daiana!

1257
01:15:11,799 --> 01:15:12,926
What's wrong?!

1258
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:15,303
It must be recoil
from the Origami System.

1259
01:15:17,972 --> 01:15:20,558
Batman, this thing's starting
to disappear!

1260
01:15:21,976 --> 01:15:23,770
You worthless piece of trash!

1261
01:15:23,853 --> 01:15:25,313
Ha!

1262
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:29,442
It's time to die!

1263
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:30,652
Gah!

1264
01:15:30,735 --> 01:15:31,611
Daiana!

1265
01:15:47,085 --> 01:15:48,253
Hm.

1266
01:16:07,021 --> 01:16:09,983
Evacuate everyone from the city.
Right now!

1267
01:16:13,278 --> 01:16:14,946
That looks bad.

1268
01:16:36,676 --> 01:16:38,428
What is happening?

1269
01:16:41,472 --> 01:16:45,810
Tokyo has physically manifested
itself outside of the fissure

1270
01:16:45,893 --> 01:16:49,522
and is now being affected
by Earth's gravity.

1271
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:52,817
And there is nothing you can do
to stop it.

1272
01:16:52,942 --> 01:16:54,152
Yes, there is.

1273
01:16:54,485 --> 01:16:57,488
I can still take back the
space-time converter from you

1274
01:16:57,572 --> 01:16:59,365
and then stop the device.

1275
01:16:59,657 --> 01:17:01,659
Mm. That's a valid point.

1276
01:17:01,993 --> 01:17:03,328
Right.

1277
01:17:03,411 --> 01:17:05,121
Then let's complicate things.

1278
01:17:19,427 --> 01:17:21,137
What the hell have you done?!

1279
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:24,349
I've detonated the base
of the structure.

1280
01:17:24,432 --> 01:17:27,268
Even if this tower is the
only thing to fall on Gotham,

1281
01:17:27,352 --> 01:17:29,979
it's still enough
to raze the city to the ground!

1282
01:17:30,063 --> 01:17:31,856
You're a damn monster!

1283
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:34,067
Farewell, then, Detective!

1284
01:17:39,572 --> 01:17:43,493
Now you and your little Bat Family
can go back to Gotham...

1285
01:17:43,576 --> 01:17:46,037
as a pile of bloody corpses.

1286
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:51,667
Aah!

1287
01:17:55,046 --> 01:17:56,255
Aah!

1288
01:18:11,521 --> 01:18:12,772
<i>At last, a signal!</i>

1289
01:18:12,855 --> 01:18:14,148
<i>Master Bruce, can you hear me?</i>

1290
01:18:14,232 --> 01:18:16,442
Copy, Alfred. What's going on?

1291
01:18:16,526 --> 01:18:20,279
<i>The fine ladies and gentlemen of</i>
<i>the Yakuza League are protecting Gotham.</i>

1292
01:18:22,573 --> 01:18:23,616
Ha!

1293
01:18:30,873 --> 01:18:33,418
- Aah!
- Aah!

1294
01:18:33,501 --> 01:18:34,961
Ha!

1295
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:37,380
- Ha!
- Oh!

1296
01:18:37,463 --> 01:18:39,966
Hyah!

1297
01:18:40,049 --> 01:18:41,968
Huh?

1298
01:18:42,593 --> 01:18:44,345
Arise!

1299
01:18:56,232 --> 01:18:57,900
Kuraku and the others.

1300
01:19:06,325 --> 01:19:08,995
- What the...?
- Master Ra's! It's him!

1301
01:19:09,078 --> 01:19:10,121
Hmm?

1302
01:19:16,294 --> 01:19:17,837
How is he doing that?

1303
01:19:22,467 --> 01:19:25,511
You're not getting away, Ra's!

1304
01:19:25,595 --> 01:19:27,263
Aah!

1305
01:19:42,111 --> 01:19:44,739
Damn you, Detective!

1306
01:19:53,498 --> 01:19:55,541
I have the space-time converter.

1307
01:19:55,625 --> 01:19:57,126
- You got it back!
- Whoa!

1308
01:19:57,210 --> 01:19:59,754
We have to hurry!
The tower is about to crash into the city!

1309
01:20:10,681 --> 01:20:11,682
It didn't work!

1310
01:20:11,766 --> 01:20:13,726
I don't think we have
enough pulse energy!

1311
01:20:19,023 --> 01:20:20,816
Is that you, Daiana?

1312
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:23,528
So what made you change your mind?

1313
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:27,490
I saw the man,
the other version of me.

1314
01:20:28,533 --> 01:20:33,120
He risked his life to protect the innocent
and vulnerable people in his world.

1315
01:20:33,663 --> 01:20:35,665
That is when I realized...

1316
01:20:36,582 --> 01:20:38,292
<i>he and I are the same,</i>

1317
01:20:38,376 --> 01:20:41,087
<i>both in heart and soul.</i>

1318
01:20:43,714 --> 01:20:46,676
<i>And I see the same is true</i>
<i>for them as well.</i>

1319
01:20:46,968 --> 01:20:48,344
Yes. That's right.

1320
01:20:48,427 --> 01:20:50,137
It's the Ninkyo spirit.

1321
01:20:50,221 --> 01:20:51,973
I suppose it is.

1322
01:20:52,390 --> 01:20:54,183
We must hang on.

1323
01:20:54,267 --> 01:20:57,061
The Bat Oyabun will find
a way out of this...

1324
01:20:57,186 --> 01:20:59,313
with a little help from a friend.

1325
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:04,110
Having yourself
some trouble there, B-man?

1326
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:08,531
Harley? What the hell
are you doing here?

1327
01:21:08,614 --> 01:21:11,534
I'm just gonna leave
if you use your mean voice.

1328
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:14,912
Be nice, and I might
just lend you a hand.

1329
01:21:14,996 --> 01:21:16,539
Daiana gave me a call.

1330
01:21:16,622 --> 01:21:18,791
She said you would need
some saving.

1331
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:21,544
And how could I turn down
a request from her?

1332
01:21:21,627 --> 01:21:23,129
Daiana sent you?

1333
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:24,255
I see.

1334
01:21:24,338 --> 01:21:27,258
When she disappeared,
she was actually going to get you.

1335
01:21:27,341 --> 01:21:29,343
Exactamundo!

1336
01:21:29,427 --> 01:21:31,012
Well, we need to move quickly!

1337
01:21:31,095 --> 01:21:33,723
I know even <i>you</i> don't want to
see Gotham destroyed.

1338
01:21:33,806 --> 01:21:35,182
Eh.

1339
01:21:37,393 --> 01:21:39,437
Wha!

1340
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:40,688
Ha!

1341
01:21:46,944 --> 01:21:47,987
Alright!

1342
01:22:03,085 --> 01:22:04,378
Hmph!

1343
01:22:12,553 --> 01:22:13,679
Hmm?

1344
01:22:13,763 --> 01:22:16,974
Take the Four-Dimensional
Origami System back to Hinomoto

1345
01:22:17,058 --> 01:22:18,601
and destroy it there.

1346
01:22:18,684 --> 01:22:21,562
That will enable the island to
slip out of the space-time fissure

1347
01:22:21,646 --> 01:22:23,606
and return your world to normal.

1348
01:22:23,689 --> 01:22:25,191
And that will be the end?

1349
01:22:25,274 --> 01:22:26,192
Yes.

1350
01:22:26,275 --> 01:22:28,944
The connection between
our two worlds will be severed.

1351
01:22:29,028 --> 01:22:32,406
Good. Then we'll take
this whole tower back with us.

1352
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:35,326
Wouldn't want it
to land here on your fine city.

1353
01:22:35,660 --> 01:22:36,702
I'll help you.

1354
01:22:36,786 --> 01:22:40,206
No, this is our mess to clean up.

1355
01:22:40,790 --> 01:22:43,209
Ahsa, Zeshika, Bari!

1356
01:22:43,292 --> 01:22:44,418
Do your thing!

1357
01:22:44,502 --> 01:22:45,670
Right!

1358
01:22:49,924 --> 01:22:51,676
Hyah!

1359
01:23:15,825 --> 01:23:18,285
Bleh! Wha!

1360
01:23:18,369 --> 01:23:21,664
Enjoy this spectacle.
It won't happen again.

1361
01:23:21,747 --> 01:23:23,416
A Hagane technique.

1362
01:23:23,499 --> 01:23:25,584
The Rising Dragon of Valor.

1363
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:27,545
Impressive.

1364
01:23:33,592 --> 01:23:37,346
Thanks for everything you've done,
Oyabun of the Bat Family.

1365
01:23:37,430 --> 01:23:40,766
We will never forget
all your kind efforts.

1366
01:23:40,975 --> 01:23:45,146
Once you return, your world will
no longer be a land filled with yakuza.

1367
01:23:45,229 --> 01:23:48,357
The honorable and the innocent
will live there now as well.

1368
01:23:48,441 --> 01:23:50,151
Sounds much better to me.

1369
01:23:50,234 --> 01:23:52,236
Did I hear that correctly?

1370
01:23:52,361 --> 01:23:55,406
You've come around to
the ways of the Ninkyo spirit?

1371
01:23:56,073 --> 01:23:57,950
I saw the real thing...

1372
01:23:58,367 --> 01:24:00,202
and so did they.

1373
01:24:02,830 --> 01:24:05,291
Good. Glad to hear.

1374
01:24:05,374 --> 01:24:07,835
Alright then. Let's go!

1375
01:24:12,214 --> 01:24:14,425
Make way! I'm gonna be first!

1376
01:24:16,135 --> 01:24:18,345
I think I'll stick with lake water.

1377
01:24:18,429 --> 01:24:20,765
Turns out the ocean is really salty.

1378
01:24:20,848 --> 01:24:22,850
You're seriously
just figuring that out?

1379
01:24:22,933 --> 01:24:24,518
Better late than never.

1380
01:24:25,936 --> 01:24:27,688
Goodbye, Miss Thang!

1381
01:24:32,526 --> 01:24:34,528
That was a heck of a punch
you gave me.

1382
01:24:34,612 --> 01:24:36,906
I'm gonna feel it for a while.

1383
01:24:36,989 --> 01:24:39,450
Now then, if you'll excuse us...

1384
01:24:58,010 --> 01:24:59,595
What was that?

1385
01:24:59,678 --> 01:25:01,972
A space-time pulse wave.

1386
01:25:02,056 --> 01:25:05,309
The Four-Dimensional Origami
System has been destroyed.

1387
01:25:05,392 --> 01:25:08,229
Does that mean
we fixed history or whatever?

1388
01:25:08,312 --> 01:25:11,315
Yeah. We're good.
Everything's back to normal.

1389
01:25:11,398 --> 01:25:12,983
At least according to hairstyle.

1390
01:25:13,067 --> 01:25:14,068
Looks great.

1391
01:25:14,151 --> 01:25:15,361
Mm? Huh?

1392
01:25:15,444 --> 01:25:17,446
Aah! Aw, not again!

1393
01:25:17,780 --> 01:25:20,407
I can't be seen out in public
like this!

1394
01:25:23,035 --> 01:25:25,246
<i>Where are you, Batman?</i>
<i>You're late.</i>

1395
01:25:25,871 --> 01:25:28,374
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>It's time for the weekly meeting.</i>

1396
01:25:28,457 --> 01:25:30,376
<i>Come on, quit goofing around.</i>

1397
01:25:30,793 --> 01:25:32,044
<i>We know you just got back</i>

1398
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:34,255
<i>from your big time-traveling</i>
<i>adventure yesterday,</i>

1399
01:25:34,338 --> 01:25:35,422
<i>but that's no excuse.</i>

1400
01:25:35,506 --> 01:25:36,340
<i>Get moving.</i>

1401
01:25:36,423 --> 01:25:37,842
{\an8}<i>We're all here waiting on you.</i>

1402
01:25:37,925 --> 01:25:39,343
{\an8}<i>You okay, Bruce?</i>

1403
01:25:39,969 --> 01:25:41,512
{\an8}<i>Is there a problem?</i>

1404
01:25:41,595 --> 01:25:43,430
Sorry.

1405
01:25:43,514 --> 01:25:44,932
I'll be right there.

1406
01:26:41,572 --> 01:26:42,948
Master Damian,

1407
01:26:43,032 --> 01:26:44,992
would you care to try wearing a wig?

1408
01:26:45,075 --> 01:26:49,538
I believe it would suit you quite well
and provide a less ostentatious look.

1409
01:26:49,622 --> 01:26:51,874
Alfred, leave me alone!
