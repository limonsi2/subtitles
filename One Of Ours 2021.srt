00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,157
- Everybody, I feel like
everybody heals differently

4
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,376
and everybody has a different
process of healing

5
00:01:13,812 --> 00:01:16,424
<i>and dealing with trauma,
and like,</i>

6
00:01:16,467 --> 00:01:18,556
<i>events that have happened
with them.</i>

7
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:22,169
<i>I was trying to heal it
on my own.</i>

8
00:01:53,287 --> 00:01:56,159
- Hi, Josiah!
Smile, come on!

9
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,385
- Come on! Wah!

10
00:02:04,428 --> 00:02:06,865
- Ah, he's not doing it.

11
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:09,085
- Do you take the
responsibilities as parents

12
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,696
to raise,
promise to do all you can,

13
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:15,265
to help present Josiah
to know Jesus?

14
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,399
- Yes, we do.

15
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:29,410
-
Qu'est-ce que tu penses, Jos?

16
00:02:29,453 --> 00:02:31,716
Est-ce que tu surpris?

17
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:36,982
Qui est là? Qui est l?

18
00:02:42,858 --> 00:02:44,903
Merci pour Bella Bella.

19
00:02:44,947 --> 00:02:47,254
- Thank you, Bella Bella.

20
00:03:41,786 --> 00:03:43,745
<i>- I'm Black, I'm from Haiti.</i>

21
00:03:43,788 --> 00:03:46,008
<i>I got adopted into a half
white-half Native family.</i>

22
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,925
<i>Because of that,
I got Native status.</i>

23
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,277
<i>This is the only life
I've known. This is day one.</i>

24
00:03:54,321 --> 00:03:56,366
- Coming bowling with us?
What the heck?

25
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,715
Of course, you're coming
bowling with us.

26
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:59,674
It's always a toss up -
basketball, bowling,

27
00:03:59,717 --> 00:04:02,329
basketball, bowling. Right?
- Uh--

28
00:04:02,372 --> 00:04:04,679
- We go bowling like, once
every five years so it's,

29
00:04:04,722 --> 00:04:06,550
so it's hard for us
to get good at it.

30
00:04:06,594 --> 00:04:08,291
- Literally, I haven't--

31
00:04:08,335 --> 00:04:10,554
- Happy adoption day, Everyone.
Woo-hoo!

32
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:13,340
- Can you believe
it's been 22 and 23 years?

33
00:04:13,383 --> 00:04:15,342
<i>Like, how did that happen?</i>

34
00:04:15,385 --> 00:04:16,952
- It only became fun when
I was born though, right?

35
00:04:16,995 --> 00:04:19,389
- The heck?!
-

36
00:04:19,433 --> 00:04:21,086
- Don, this chicken's
really good.

37
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,219
- Unlike you,
you tell Mom everything.

38
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,960
- I'm glad you like it.

39
00:04:25,003 --> 00:04:26,918
- Yo, you gotta get one of
these guys on your farm.

40
00:04:26,962 --> 00:04:28,746
The all-black chickens.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

41
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,705
- The Blacks are black meat
and everything.

42
00:04:30,748 --> 00:04:32,707
I don't know where
they're from, but--

43
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,709
- They're from Indonesia.
- All right, let's go get one.

44
00:04:34,752 --> 00:04:36,711
- Yeah. Like, they're black,
black, black.

45
00:04:36,754 --> 00:04:38,800
Even their meat is dark, dark,
dark purple.

46
00:04:38,843 --> 00:04:40,715
- So weird.
- Yeah.

47
00:04:40,758 --> 00:04:42,760
- That doesn't look appetizing.
- A black pig.

48
00:04:42,804 --> 00:04:44,545
Black is beautiful!

49
00:04:44,588 --> 00:04:46,155
- It's true.

50
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,464
<i>- I don't even know
what age I even like,</i>

51
00:04:50,507 --> 00:04:52,379
<i>it hit me that I was adopted,
or nothin', like,</i>

52
00:04:52,422 --> 00:04:54,337
<i>honestly, for the longest time,
I thought</i>

53
00:04:54,381 --> 00:04:56,339
<i>I was just the same
as everybody else.</i>

54
00:04:56,383 --> 00:04:58,428
<i>All I knew is I didn't
actually have a like,</i>

55
00:04:58,472 --> 00:05:00,387
a birth Mom and Dad,
and all that stuff.

56
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,779
Like, that's all I knew.

57
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,738
I knew, I knew something
was up because I was like,

58
00:05:03,781 --> 00:05:05,435
I don't actually
have parents, like,

59
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:06,828
I'm living with somebody else.

60
00:05:06,871 --> 00:05:08,786
<i>Something that I didn't
know yet was just off,</i>

61
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,354
<i>and it was that like,
that connection,</i>

62
00:05:11,398 --> 00:05:13,443
<i>that like full blood on
connection.</i>

63
00:05:13,487 --> 00:05:15,358
They never really made it seem
like if I was different,

64
00:05:15,402 --> 00:05:18,187
or anything like that like--
I felt like, the same,

65
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,102
<i>but I knew something
wasn't fully there.</i>

66
00:05:22,104 --> 00:05:24,280
- Our adoption day tradition
has always been to say

67
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,457
that it's a very special time,
and we all get very cheesy,

68
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:29,546
so I'm trying not
to be cheesy, Josiah.

69
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,635
He's like, "Don't get cheesy."

70
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:34,246
- Are we all gonna say one
thing we appreciate?

71
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,379
- No that's Thanksgiving.
-

72
00:05:36,423 --> 00:05:38,425
- But anyways, our tradition
has always been just to say

73
00:05:38,468 --> 00:05:42,080
that Mariah and Josiah
are amazing, and we love them,

74
00:05:42,124 --> 00:05:44,082
and we're so happy that
they're in our family.

75
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:48,086
- Don't drag it on.

76
00:05:49,523 --> 00:05:51,089
<i>- We have to leave in
five minutes, for bowling.</i>

77
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:54,223
- Uh, okay. Goodbye.
- Jos, don't run away!

78
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:56,094
- No.
- You're very fun.

79
00:05:57,531 --> 00:05:59,315
- Always give thanks to God

80
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,013
for giving Mariah and Josiah
to our family.

81
00:06:03,101 --> 00:06:04,799
Always.

82
00:06:04,842 --> 00:06:06,583
I think um,

83
00:06:06,627 --> 00:06:09,020
you're much easier
to look after

84
00:06:09,064 --> 00:06:11,806
before you turn 26.
-

85
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:13,851
- I agree.

86
00:06:13,895 --> 00:06:16,071
- Alright.
-

87
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,291
- Okay, Jos, your turn.
Damian, your turn.

88
00:06:19,335 --> 00:06:21,250
- I've gotta thank Josiah
for toughening me up

89
00:06:21,293 --> 00:06:24,732
and roughing me around
all until I was like, 13.

90
00:06:26,473 --> 00:06:28,431
And now I'm immune.

91
00:06:28,475 --> 00:06:30,607
Stronger, because of him.

92
00:06:30,651 --> 00:06:32,261
And then, thanks for Mariah,

93
00:06:32,304 --> 00:06:35,177
for showing me the other side
of siblings.

94
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,744
- We didn't know what the hell
we were doing,

95
00:06:36,787 --> 00:06:38,136
but it turned out pretty good.

96
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,877
- We did not know what
the hell we were doing.

97
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:42,097
Nowadays, people have read
like, 19 books

98
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,273
before they even get pregnant,
and we didn't read anything,

99
00:06:44,316 --> 00:06:46,449
we didn't know anything,
we didn't, had no idea.

100
00:06:46,493 --> 00:06:49,060
- Remember that time and
we had that quilt thing,

101
00:06:49,104 --> 00:06:51,628
and it was one
of the few blankets.

102
00:06:51,672 --> 00:06:53,325
- Oh, and she got all
tangled up in it.

103
00:06:53,369 --> 00:06:55,110
- And she got tangled up in it
and her whole head

104
00:06:55,153 --> 00:06:57,112
was wrapped in that quilt.
- Oh, my God.

105
00:06:57,155 --> 00:06:59,157
- And she fell off the end
of the bed into a basket

106
00:06:59,201 --> 00:07:01,203
with this thing wrapped
around her head.

107
00:07:01,246 --> 00:07:02,944
I'm like, "Why does
she sound so muffled?"

108
00:07:02,987 --> 00:07:05,468
- What the heck?!

109
00:07:05,512 --> 00:07:07,688
That's why you don't put
blanket on a baby!

110
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:09,777
- That explains a lot.

111
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,866
- We didn't have anything
there! No crib.

112
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:13,737
- We had no nothing.
We literally,

113
00:07:13,781 --> 00:07:15,565
were not going to Haiti
to try to find kids.

114
00:07:15,609 --> 00:07:17,219
She landed in our laps.

115
00:07:18,873 --> 00:07:21,919
<i>As a Heiltsuk person,</i>

116
00:07:21,963 --> 00:07:25,314
<i>home will always be Bella
Bella,</i>

117
00:07:25,357 --> 00:07:28,012
<i>will always be the Heiltsuk
Nation.</i>

118
00:07:28,056 --> 00:07:29,884
<i>The kids always knew that.</i>

119
00:07:29,927 --> 00:07:32,190
<i>They knew that that's
where Daddy's from,</i>

120
00:07:32,234 --> 00:07:34,976
<i>that's where our family all is.</i>

121
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:37,587
<i>I had 14 years to live immersed</i>

122
00:07:37,631 --> 00:07:40,198
<i>in my Nation and my community,</i>

123
00:07:40,242 --> 00:07:42,287
<i>and I haven't had that
opportunity ever since.</i>

124
00:07:43,637 --> 00:07:45,943
<i>I watch it all from afar.</i>

125
00:07:45,987 --> 00:07:48,685
<i>It didn't take the core
identity out of me.</i>

126
00:07:51,558 --> 00:07:53,342
- This is Bella Bella.

127
00:07:54,952 --> 00:07:56,911
<i>- And I still identify as a,</i>

128
00:07:56,954 --> 00:07:59,304
<i>as a Heiltsuk person above,
above all else.</i>

129
00:07:59,348 --> 00:08:01,002
- Look at Mama!

130
00:08:01,045 --> 00:08:04,527
- And I tried to instil that
connectedness to my children.

131
00:08:06,137 --> 00:08:08,618
- Welcome home.
That is beautiful!

132
00:08:08,662 --> 00:08:11,360
<i>You guys did a great job.</i>

133
00:08:11,403 --> 00:08:13,754
- We go to Bella,
and like, they love us.

134
00:08:15,582 --> 00:08:17,540
- Papa can ring for service!

135
00:08:19,237 --> 00:08:20,804
<i>- We've been part
of the family there.</i>

136
00:08:20,848 --> 00:08:22,980
They, they treat us like
one of their own, they,

137
00:08:23,024 --> 00:08:24,982
it ain't no different.

138
00:08:25,026 --> 00:08:26,984
<i>So, I mean, they've always
just accepted us,</i>

139
00:08:27,028 --> 00:08:29,030
<i>which is beautiful.</i>

140
00:08:35,776 --> 00:08:37,908
- Hey!

141
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:39,606
- Hey-hey-hey!

142
00:08:42,783 --> 00:08:45,437
- Oh! Ooh!
- Yo, this guy!

143
00:08:45,481 --> 00:08:47,135
- He would've been like,
that's not my name.

144
00:08:50,225 --> 00:08:51,879
<i>As long as I can
remember,</i>

145
00:08:51,922 --> 00:08:54,403
<i>basketball has been the one
thing that I've played,</i>

146
00:08:54,446 --> 00:08:55,752
<i>dreamt of.</i>

147
00:09:03,238 --> 00:09:04,892
<i>It was very important to me,
like,</i>

148
00:09:04,935 --> 00:09:07,677
<i>I played it from a young age,
I played on multiple teams,</i>

149
00:09:07,721 --> 00:09:09,766
<i>I travelled all over with them.</i>

150
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,682
<i>I won a couple championships,
and whatnot.</i>

151
00:09:12,726 --> 00:09:15,685
<i>Basketball was always like,
the one that stuck around,</i>

152
00:09:15,729 --> 00:09:17,905
<i>like, no matter what else
I did, or whatever,</i>

153
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:20,298
<i>I'd always come back to
basketball at the end
of the day.</i>

154
00:09:20,342 --> 00:09:22,387
<i>It was a very important
piece of my life.</i>

155
00:09:24,738 --> 00:09:27,088
<i>So, Josiah got involved
with the high school team</i>

156
00:09:27,131 --> 00:09:29,046
<i>and some community leagues,
and he just loved it</i>

157
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:32,354
<i>and he was really good at it.</i>

158
00:09:32,397 --> 00:09:34,661
<i>And he got invited
to participate</i>

159
00:09:34,704 --> 00:09:37,577
<i>in the Heiltsuk Nation um,
Junior All Native team.</i>

160
00:09:39,317 --> 00:09:41,276
<i>The All Native basketball
tournament is a big deal</i>

161
00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:44,758
<i>on the West Coast.
Basketball is,</i>

162
00:09:44,801 --> 00:09:47,630
<i>is the sport that everybody
is really passionate about,</i>

163
00:09:47,674 --> 00:09:50,807
<i>and it goes back a long ways,
like decades.</i>

164
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:53,462
<i>Teams would train all year,</i>

165
00:09:53,505 --> 00:09:55,333
<i>they would bring all
of their village pride</i>

166
00:09:55,377 --> 00:09:58,728
<i>to the tournament and
compete for their Nations.</i>

167
00:09:58,772 --> 00:10:00,817
<i>So, this was a really cool
way for him</i>

168
00:10:00,861 --> 00:10:03,646
<i>to get involved with people
from home, and sort of learn,</i>

169
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,344
<i>and connect,
and learn about the culture.</i>

170
00:10:06,388 --> 00:10:08,346
<i>He played for two years</i>

171
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,174
<i>at the All Native basketball
tournament.</i>

172
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,482
<i>Until the third year,</i>

173
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:16,703
<i>somebody protested
his involvement,</i>

174
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:19,357
<i>and one of their rules was that</i>

175
00:10:19,401 --> 00:10:21,838
an individual had to be born

176
00:10:21,882 --> 00:10:25,146
with at least one-eighth
Indigenous blood.

177
00:10:25,189 --> 00:10:28,758
<i>That is a type of a blood
quantum rule.</i>

178
00:10:28,802 --> 00:10:31,326
They can't legally be
that, because I was adopted,

179
00:10:31,369 --> 00:10:33,894
and it's, from,
from me being adopted,

180
00:10:33,937 --> 00:10:36,984
it's pretty much the same
thing as if I had Native blood,

181
00:10:37,027 --> 00:10:39,464
because it's not like if I had
a choice for this situation.

182
00:10:39,508 --> 00:10:41,423
But they didn't want
to see it like that.

183
00:10:41,466 --> 00:10:44,905
And then, when they found
out that he was born Haitian

184
00:10:44,948 --> 00:10:48,778
and we adopted him, they
said well, he can't play.

185
00:10:48,822 --> 00:10:50,911
<i>Who is
Indigenous?</i>

186
00:10:50,954 --> 00:10:52,826
<i>The question has been
at the centre</i>

187
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:55,742
<i>of a controversial decision
to deny Josiah Wilson</i>

188
00:10:55,785 --> 00:10:58,875
<i>from playing in the All Native
basketball tournament.</i>

189
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:01,704
- He had already provided
his status card uh,

190
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:04,707
as proof that his is a
Registered Status Indian.

191
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:07,579
<i>- The family was shocked
when the 21 year old</i>

192
00:11:07,623 --> 00:11:09,407
<i>was sent a letter barring
him from playing</i>

193
00:11:09,451 --> 00:11:11,540
<i>in the All Native Basketball
Tournament.</i>

194
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,803
- Do you consider yourself
First Nations?

195
00:11:13,847 --> 00:11:16,414
- Yes, I do. I've been,
I've been part

196
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:19,330
of the community in Bella Bella,
the Heiltsuk community,

197
00:11:19,374 --> 00:11:21,202
for a while now, and I was
a social worker out there

198
00:11:21,245 --> 00:11:23,204
and I helped out with the kids,
and everything like that.

199
00:11:23,247 --> 00:11:25,989
<i>So, yeah, I do consider myself
part of their community.</i>

200
00:11:26,033 --> 00:11:27,730
I was actually shocked and hurt,
just knowing that

201
00:11:27,774 --> 00:11:30,385
after two years of playing
for the All Native,

202
00:11:30,428 --> 00:11:33,388
and they've seen me play before,
and then just boom,

203
00:11:33,431 --> 00:11:35,433
they say that I can't play
for them,

204
00:11:35,477 --> 00:11:37,479
I was actually very shocked
on that.

205
00:11:37,522 --> 00:11:39,481
<i>If they see that I'm adopted
and I have a Native status,</i>

206
00:11:39,524 --> 00:11:40,830
<i>I feel like I should be allowed
to play.</i>

207
00:11:43,572 --> 00:11:44,965
- You got this!

208
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:50,231
- You're gonna break
things here.

209
00:11:50,274 --> 00:11:52,450
- It goes by the name.
- Well, that's racist.

210
00:11:52,494 --> 00:11:54,626
- What?

211
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,411
- Why do the Black kids
have to go last, huh?

212
00:11:56,454 --> 00:11:58,413
- Wait a minute, no,
I go first!

213
00:11:58,456 --> 00:12:01,068
- Yeah, you literally put--

214
00:12:01,111 --> 00:12:03,244
- I put my name in first.

215
00:12:03,287 --> 00:12:05,333
Okay!
This looks promising, Dad!

216
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,771
- Yeeahhhh!
- Okay.

217
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:12,340
I told Mariah if she doesn't
get a strike

218
00:12:12,383 --> 00:12:13,776
she can't come back home,
that's it.

219
00:12:16,344 --> 00:12:18,259
- Oh, maybe, maybe, maybe! Oh!

220
00:12:22,872 --> 00:12:24,831
<i>I'm very proud
of my parents for like,</i>

221
00:12:24,874 --> 00:12:26,702
<i>making those choices that
they made in their life</i>

222
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,574
to adopt two, beautiful,
great kids from Haiti,

223
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:32,273
and then, um, having two
of their own as well,

224
00:12:32,316 --> 00:12:34,754
<i>and then like, being able to,</i>

225
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:36,320
<i>to bond and to be stronger
as a family,</i>

226
00:12:36,364 --> 00:12:38,975
<i>I think that's awesome
how that story played out.</i>

227
00:12:46,113 --> 00:12:48,289
<i>Adoption is,
certainly in my world view,</i>

228
00:12:48,332 --> 00:12:51,031
<i>it's a very powerful thing.</i>

229
00:12:51,074 --> 00:12:52,815
- I was so close!

230
00:12:52,859 --> 00:12:54,643
<i>We were young and naive,</i>

231
00:12:54,686 --> 00:12:56,688
<i>not knowing what we were
getting ourselves into.</i>

232
00:12:56,732 --> 00:12:59,082
<i>Ended up moving to Haiti.</i>

233
00:12:59,126 --> 00:13:01,258
<i>The chapter of our lives
in Haiti</i>

234
00:13:01,302 --> 00:13:03,521
<i>still reverberates today</i>

235
00:13:03,565 --> 00:13:05,654
<i>because we ended up starting
our family down there</i>

236
00:13:05,697 --> 00:13:08,004
<i>and adopting our two kids.</i>

237
00:13:11,921 --> 00:13:14,619
Bumpy ride,
but we're at...

238
00:13:14,663 --> 00:13:17,361
at Numerson's compound
in Léogâne.

239
00:13:19,886 --> 00:13:22,932
<i>I had a nursing degree;
she was a teacher.</i>

240
00:13:22,976 --> 00:13:25,239
<i>We thought we could do some
good in the world</i>

241
00:13:25,282 --> 00:13:27,241
<i>and we looked for
opportunities,</i>

242
00:13:27,284 --> 00:13:30,157
<i>so we both ended up
working in the hospital.</i>

243
00:13:50,612 --> 00:13:52,875
<i>In my culture,
in the Heiltsuk culture,</i>

244
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:56,748
<i>adoption has been a very
important part of our culture.</i>

245
00:13:56,792 --> 00:13:59,403
<i>It's the way we grow our
families and,</i>

246
00:13:59,447 --> 00:14:01,884
<i>and strengthen ties
between communities,</i>

247
00:14:01,928 --> 00:14:04,887
so adoption was nothing
strange or new, to me.

248
00:14:09,152 --> 00:14:11,067
<i>Doesn't matter how you
have your children,</i>

249
00:14:11,111 --> 00:14:13,591
you just love them. You,
you would do anything for them.

250
00:14:18,988 --> 00:14:21,382
<i>There's the family
that we're born into,</i>

251
00:14:21,425 --> 00:14:23,558
<i>there's the family
that we married into.</i>

252
00:14:23,601 --> 00:14:25,603
- Okay, avec la, okay.

253
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:32,349
<i>Even though my ex-wife
and I are divorced,</i>

254
00:14:32,393 --> 00:14:35,613
<i>we still act like a family</i>

255
00:14:35,657 --> 00:14:38,138
<i>because we love these kids
so much.</i>

256
00:14:38,181 --> 00:14:41,010
- Eh, dansez-vous!

257
00:14:49,018 --> 00:14:50,715
- I mean, it was a good night,
though. I ain't gonna lie

258
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:52,804
like, we had fun,
to an extent.

259
00:14:52,848 --> 00:14:55,198
I mean, they had fun.
I had--

260
00:14:55,242 --> 00:14:57,331
- You didn't have fun?

261
00:14:57,374 --> 00:15:00,160
- Hmm, I enjoyed seeing
my Grandma.

262
00:15:02,466 --> 00:15:04,947
So, I haven't seen her in like
three and a half, four months.

263
00:15:04,991 --> 00:15:06,557
So, it was definitely a good
thing for me to see her.

264
00:15:08,298 --> 00:15:10,257
Dad asked if my Grandma was
there, I already told, um,

265
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,650
I would've dipped out so quick.
I wouldn't have stayed.

266
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:16,872
My Grandma, she's my OG, yo!
- Yeah?

267
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,961
- Ever since my Grandpa
passed away,

268
00:15:19,005 --> 00:15:21,094
I just had to be there
for her and like,

269
00:15:21,137 --> 00:15:23,879
my Grandpa was the, my day one.
Yo, like,

270
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,098
I'll show you my Grandpa, y'all.

271
00:15:25,141 --> 00:15:26,664
This man,

272
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:29,537
he's straight Native,
you know what I'm sayin',

273
00:15:31,017 --> 00:15:32,801
like, this is my Dad's Dad.

274
00:15:32,844 --> 00:15:34,455
I could straight up
consider them like,

275
00:15:34,498 --> 00:15:38,067
a second set of parents,
pretty much.

276
00:15:38,111 --> 00:15:40,635
Maybe even a third or fourth
set of parents, if you wanna,

277
00:15:40,678 --> 00:15:43,246
go, like that,
but that's another story.

278
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,031
From the moment that,

279
00:15:45,074 --> 00:15:47,207
honestly, from the moment that
my parents got separated,

280
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:50,123
'til like, 'til now, yo,
my Grandma, my Grandpa

281
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,168
have been like, literally
the closest, beside my homies.

282
00:15:53,822 --> 00:15:55,650
Oh, yeah, this is,
this is my,

283
00:15:55,693 --> 00:15:57,652
this is one of the first times
Papa ever went to Haiti.

284
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,871
I think this is like, their
only time they've ever went.

285
00:15:59,915 --> 00:16:01,482
That was like, one thing
I was actually upset

286
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:03,266
when he passed away is like,

287
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,268
he really wanted to go back
to Haiti again.

288
00:16:05,312 --> 00:16:08,315
You know, he was definitely
one of a guy, one of a kind guy,

289
00:16:08,358 --> 00:16:10,273
like, yeah, he was special.

290
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:13,189
He was really special to me.

291
00:16:17,802 --> 00:16:19,717
- I saw this guy downtown,
this white guy,

292
00:16:19,761 --> 00:16:21,154
with the worst dreads.
I was just like, "Oh, my God."

293
00:16:21,197 --> 00:16:23,243
- He was white?

294
00:16:23,286 --> 00:16:25,027
- First of all, white people
shouldn't have dreads, but-

295
00:16:25,071 --> 00:16:26,681
That's what I'm saying, white
people don't get dreads.

296
00:16:26,724 --> 00:16:28,639
- But-
- Yo, they're ugly.

297
00:16:28,683 --> 00:16:30,902
- Because their hair doesn't
lock, right, properly.

298
00:16:30,946 --> 00:16:33,731
But also, they were really
hideous looking.

299
00:16:34,863 --> 00:16:37,039
- So disrespectful.
So racist.

300
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,519
- That's, yeah,
he shouldn't be wearing--

301
00:16:38,562 --> 00:16:40,738
- So racist to have red dreads
like that, you ugly ass.

302
00:16:40,782 --> 00:16:42,523
- I think--

303
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:45,482
- I like, keeping hollers to
be like, "Who does your hair?"

304
00:16:45,526 --> 00:16:47,528
- Uh huh! I know!

305
00:16:47,571 --> 00:16:49,530
- All I'm saying is that,
fuck all that other shit,

306
00:16:49,573 --> 00:16:51,445
my Mom knows what she's doin'.

307
00:16:51,488 --> 00:16:53,273
We don't need all those
extra tools.

308
00:16:53,316 --> 00:16:55,057
Y'all got money though?
If y'all got money,

309
00:16:55,101 --> 00:16:56,754
you can come,
you know what I'm saying?

310
00:16:56,798 --> 00:16:58,669
- Exactly, you gonna pay me?
- Ten percent for the boy,

311
00:16:58,713 --> 00:17:00,454
you know, 90% for her,
you know what I'm saying?

312
00:17:00,497 --> 00:17:03,109
- Oh, ten, okay,
that sounds fair.

313
00:17:03,152 --> 00:17:05,502
Trying to make you look good.
Price you pay to be beautiful.

314
00:17:06,808 --> 00:17:08,375
- Well, it shouldn't hurt
to be beautiful.

315
00:17:08,418 --> 00:17:10,246
- Well, I know, it shouldn't,

316
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,248
but tell that to every woman
who waxes her legs.

317
00:17:12,292 --> 00:17:14,381
You're gonna be so handsome
after this.

318
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,691
<i>The thing that he said then,
and he said as he got older,</i>

319
00:17:20,735 --> 00:17:22,476
<i>Dad shouldn't have left us.</i>

320
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:24,086
<i>Everybody leaves.</i>

321
00:17:25,783 --> 00:17:27,655
<i>Our divorce was extremely
hard on him</i>

322
00:17:29,396 --> 00:17:31,746
<i>and he has taken that on
as a bit of an abandonment.</i>

323
00:17:36,881 --> 00:17:40,363
<i>And so, then being rejected by
the Indigenous community</i>

324
00:17:40,407 --> 00:17:42,583
and that basketball community
that had been important to him,

325
00:17:42,626 --> 00:17:44,150
<i>there's been a lot there
that he has to work through.</i>

326
00:17:46,978 --> 00:17:49,198
<i>Everybody's always looking
for where do they belong</i>

327
00:17:49,242 --> 00:17:51,809
<i>in the world, and that was
a place he belonged, right.</i>

328
00:17:54,377 --> 00:17:56,727
<i>What about
this stings the most,</i>

329
00:17:56,771 --> 00:18:00,209
I mean, this idea that you're,
you're not Native enough

330
00:18:00,253 --> 00:18:02,211
to participate
in the tournament?

331
00:18:02,255 --> 00:18:03,995
- Even though I have status

332
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:06,563
<i>and I've been part of the
community for a long time now,</i>

333
00:18:06,607 --> 00:18:08,522
<i>and I lived out there
with my Grandma,</i>

334
00:18:08,565 --> 00:18:10,350
<i>just not being able to go up
there this year with the boys,</i>

335
00:18:10,393 --> 00:18:12,787
<i>to see them,
everything just hurts.</i>

336
00:18:14,354 --> 00:18:16,617
<i>It made a scar on me,
you know what I'm saying,</i>

337
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,793
<i>like, it definitely let a mark.</i>

338
00:18:18,836 --> 00:18:20,708
<i>Who are you to tell me
that I ain't Native?</i>

339
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:25,974
<i>As a Black person adopted
by a non-Black family,</i>

340
00:18:26,017 --> 00:18:28,150
he's already had to contend
with that side

341
00:18:28,194 --> 00:18:31,110
of his identity
and figure out who he was.

342
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,114
He came into our family by
adoption and not by birth,

343
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:37,855
<i>doesn't make him any less
legitimately Heiltsuk.</i>

344
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,076
<i>The blood quantum rule,</i>

345
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,426
if you carry it to
its logical conclusion,

346
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:46,212
it will eliminate and erase
Indigenous people down the road.

347
00:18:47,604 --> 00:18:50,041
<i>That's a colonial concept</i>

348
00:18:50,085 --> 00:18:52,609
<i>that has been imposed
on Indigenous people.</i>

349
00:18:52,653 --> 00:18:56,874
<i>Kinship and family
is so important to us.</i>

350
00:18:56,918 --> 00:18:58,833
<i>It's nobody else's business
to tell us</i>

351
00:18:58,876 --> 00:19:01,140
<i>who belongs and who doesn't.</i>

352
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:04,055
It's kind of one of the last
things we have to protect

353
00:19:04,099 --> 00:19:08,016
is who we are, and our way
of life, and you know,

354
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:10,366
kinship and that part
of our identity

355
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,281
is crucial to our survival.

356
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,937
<i>I decided I wouldn't
let it pass</i>

357
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,201
<i>and tried to engage
some communication</i>

358
00:19:19,245 --> 00:19:21,029
<i>with the All Native Basketball
Tournament committee,</i>

359
00:19:21,072 --> 00:19:23,336
<i>and they wouldn't talk.</i>

360
00:19:23,379 --> 00:19:27,122
So, I took it to the British
Columbia Human Rights Tribunal

361
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,429
and lodged a formal complaint.

362
00:19:29,472 --> 00:19:31,474
<i>So, it's important
to read the question over</i>

363
00:19:31,518 --> 00:19:34,260
<i>a couple of times.
Especially on a final exam.</i>

364
00:19:34,303 --> 00:19:39,265
<i>So, 12,000, arrears were,
divide that by 12 months.</i>

365
00:19:39,308 --> 00:19:42,877
<i>The adjustment amount
would have been $1000.</i>

366
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,880
<i>So on future test or exams
ask yourself</i>

367
00:19:47,751 --> 00:19:50,276
<i>what period am I preparing
this financial statement...?</i>

368
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:52,103
<i>It was very traumatic,</i>

369
00:19:52,147 --> 00:19:54,541
<i>like it just had me questioning
so much and just like,</i>

370
00:19:54,584 --> 00:19:56,238
<i>it just had me all fucked up.</i>

371
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,721
It was around that time too,
was when I really started

372
00:20:00,764 --> 00:20:02,244
becoming a stoner, and whatnot.

373
00:20:04,899 --> 00:20:06,683
<i>I definitely used weed like,</i>

374
00:20:06,727 --> 00:20:08,946
<i>to cope with a bunch
of that bullshit.</i>

375
00:20:10,513 --> 00:20:12,254
<i>Doing that, that was definitely
keeping me distracted</i>

376
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:15,083
<i>and whatnot, and trying not to
think of all this negativity,</i>

377
00:20:15,126 --> 00:20:16,693
<i>and all that bullshit,
and all that.</i>

378
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,007
- Yeah, a lot of like,
the fats, and lipids

379
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:28,183
and like, the toxins
that you would find.

380
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,967
Like, I don't know, like you
don't get the heavy tars

381
00:20:30,011 --> 00:20:31,708
from burning it,
like when you smoke a bong,

382
00:20:31,752 --> 00:20:33,536
or when you smoke a joint.

383
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,973
You can like, feel the like,
heavy kind of resins and tars.

384
00:20:36,017 --> 00:20:38,324
Whereas you do this, it's
already, it's all kind of,

385
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:40,282
all that stuff's been removed,
so, you're just kinda getting

386
00:20:40,326 --> 00:20:42,893
all the good stuff
in one little bunch.

387
00:20:52,207 --> 00:20:54,383
I'll be flying like,
in February though,

388
00:20:54,427 --> 00:20:56,385
because I have to go to a
basketball tournament in BC,

389
00:20:56,429 --> 00:20:59,127
for like, this whole thing.
- Yeah.

390
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:01,303
- So, it's like maybe.
I don't know if I'm gonna stay

391
00:21:01,347 --> 00:21:03,087
up for the whole tournament,
yet.

392
00:21:03,131 --> 00:21:04,872
I just wanna go see my cousins
and my homies,

393
00:21:04,915 --> 00:21:07,004
and all that stuff, the family.

394
00:21:07,048 --> 00:21:10,007
And then, deal with the stuff
I gotta deal with.

395
00:21:10,051 --> 00:21:12,532
It's crazy how packed it gets.
It's wild.

396
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,229
It's honestly a good time
though, it's just like,

397
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:17,145
a huge gathering of like,
Native clans,

398
00:21:17,188 --> 00:21:18,886
just to play ball.
It's honestly like,

399
00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:20,627
it's a good time,
that's all it is.

400
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,933
But I mean, that's what it was.

401
00:21:22,977 --> 00:21:24,979
It was supposed to be,
but they fucked up.

402
00:21:25,022 --> 00:21:27,024
But who knows.

403
00:21:28,678 --> 00:21:30,941
Only time can tell, I guess.

404
00:21:49,438 --> 00:21:52,528
<i>A washing ceremony
is a way, culturally,</i>

405
00:21:52,572 --> 00:21:55,357
<i>we take away the negative
influence and impact</i>

406
00:21:55,401 --> 00:21:57,794
<i>of a bad experience on someone</i>

407
00:21:57,838 --> 00:21:59,840
<i>and we wash it off
of the trauma</i>

408
00:21:59,883 --> 00:22:01,232
<i>and the negativity of that.</i>

409
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,414
- Yo, what's goin' on?
- How you doin', Big Papa?

410
00:22:08,457 --> 00:22:09,980
- What's goin' on?
- I'm good, man. How ya doin'?

411
00:22:10,024 --> 00:22:12,287
- Good to see you.
- You too, Boss.

412
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,420
- What ya doin'?
- Man, we're just goin' up
to Rupert.

413
00:22:14,463 --> 00:22:15,943
- You playin'?
- No, not this year.

414
00:22:15,986 --> 00:22:18,032
- I'm playing.
- You're playing?

415
00:22:18,075 --> 00:22:19,990
<i>When my dad first told
me about the washing ceremony,</i>

416
00:22:20,034 --> 00:22:22,036
<i>I was like, "What?"</i>

417
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:24,081
<i>I ani't never heard of
something like that before,</i>

418
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:26,780
<i>but then he explained it to me,
and I was like, you know what,</i>

419
00:22:26,823 --> 00:22:29,565
<i>this could be something
we could do.</i>

420
00:22:29,609 --> 00:22:31,175
Over there, I don't know
if you can see the lights,

421
00:22:31,219 --> 00:22:33,482
there's like, that's the city,
Bella Bella.

422
00:22:33,526 --> 00:22:35,789
But like, we just take them up,
and now we're goin',

423
00:22:35,832 --> 00:22:37,834
now we're goin' like, up north.

424
00:22:37,878 --> 00:22:39,619
It's like, it's Natives.

425
00:22:42,709 --> 00:22:44,972
- Jos!

426
00:22:45,015 --> 00:22:47,191
- Oh, come here, kid!
Oh, my God!

427
00:22:47,235 --> 00:22:50,020
I've been lookin' for you
this whole time.

428
00:22:50,064 --> 00:22:51,674
How you doin', girl?
- Good.

429
00:22:57,158 --> 00:22:59,682
- The Rupert people that kicked
me outta this shit,

430
00:22:59,726 --> 00:23:02,119
saying I can't play because
I'm Black, know what I'm sayin'.

431
00:23:02,163 --> 00:23:04,426
But they didn't say those words,
but

432
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,080
we all know that's what
they meant.

433
00:23:06,123 --> 00:23:08,517
See a Black man dunkin'
around and stuff like that,

434
00:23:08,561 --> 00:23:10,867
and actually you know, you
can't play, bro.

435
00:23:10,911 --> 00:23:13,304
But it is what it is,
you know what I'm sayin'.

436
00:23:13,348 --> 00:23:15,089
That's why we on this trip.

437
00:23:15,132 --> 00:23:17,178
Not knowin' what's poppin'.

438
00:23:17,221 --> 00:23:19,093
So is it that
you just like,

439
00:23:19,136 --> 00:23:21,182
you wanna meet people.

440
00:23:21,225 --> 00:23:22,966
- Yeah, the main thing. I just
wanna see who these niggas is.

441
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,059
- Oh, y'all didn't hear about
that, huh? Y'all didn't hear,

442
00:23:29,103 --> 00:23:30,713
you didn't hear what
was happenin' with that?

443
00:23:30,757 --> 00:23:32,933
- What happened?
- Oh!

444
00:23:32,976 --> 00:23:34,978
Yeah, we're not getting it
no more.

445
00:23:36,502 --> 00:23:39,113
It's like, 'cause I didn't
come up last year

446
00:23:39,156 --> 00:23:41,463
because of my surgery, like,
as if it was my fault right,

447
00:23:41,507 --> 00:23:43,117
because you know like,
I planned to get surgery.

448
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,512
So, if you can't do that man,
you a bum nigga.

449
00:23:46,555 --> 00:23:48,035
That's all I'm saying.

450
00:23:50,124 --> 00:23:52,082
But hey, like I said,

451
00:23:53,388 --> 00:23:54,911
we'll see what happens
when we get up there.

452
00:24:03,616 --> 00:24:05,531
- I'd like to call on the

453
00:24:05,574 --> 00:24:08,795
Intermediate Coach and Manager.

454
00:24:10,579 --> 00:24:11,754
So, you know, we had a problem
with getting Josiah

455
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:13,669
on the basketball team,

456
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,368
and we're thankful
for all our people

457
00:24:17,412 --> 00:24:20,154
for standing up for Josiah,
the Hereditary Chiefs,

458
00:24:20,197 --> 00:24:22,286
Tribal Council,
and all our people.

459
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,071
You know, he was adopted
in the traditional way

460
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,161
and we've always accepted him

461
00:24:27,204 --> 00:24:29,163
and we're so thankful for him
to be coming to play

462
00:24:29,206 --> 00:24:31,992
with his team, the young men
that he played with

463
00:24:32,035 --> 00:24:34,995
over the time at the All Native
Tournament.

464
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:38,041
We all know that
Josiah's from Haiti,

465
00:24:38,085 --> 00:24:39,956
that's where he's originally
from,

466
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,306
but he only knows Heiltsuk,
you know,

467
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,265
and that's the important part.

468
00:24:44,308 --> 00:24:46,615
So, we wanted to
do this here today

469
00:24:46,659 --> 00:24:49,009
because the All Native
Tournament committee

470
00:24:49,052 --> 00:24:51,228
wouldn't allow us to do it in

471
00:24:51,272 --> 00:24:53,143
the All Native Tournament,

472
00:24:54,275 --> 00:24:56,407
which is unfortunate.

473
00:24:56,451 --> 00:24:58,279
So, if we can stand up
in front of our people

474
00:24:58,322 --> 00:25:00,411
and just let him know
how happy we are to,

475
00:25:00,455 --> 00:25:02,544
to have him back here today.

476
00:25:02,588 --> 00:25:04,459
He knows how much you care
for him,

477
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,548
because he can feel it.

478
00:25:06,592 --> 00:25:08,376
You know, he knows he's
around family right now.

479
00:25:14,817 --> 00:25:16,993
- Thank you.

480
00:25:17,037 --> 00:25:18,995
Thank you.

481
00:25:22,477 --> 00:25:24,566
I just wanted to say
thank you to all of you,

482
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,263
for all the support
and all the love

483
00:25:26,307 --> 00:25:29,049
that you guys have shown
throughout the last four years

484
00:25:29,092 --> 00:25:31,399
since I got kicked out.

485
00:25:31,442 --> 00:25:33,053
Um, it's been hard on me
and my family,

486
00:25:33,096 --> 00:25:35,577
and I know it's been hard on
my teammates and my community,

487
00:25:35,621 --> 00:25:37,884
but I just wanted to say that
you guys stood behind me

488
00:25:37,927 --> 00:25:39,842
and was with me the whole time,

489
00:25:39,886 --> 00:25:41,670
so I just wanted to say
thank you a lot, for that.

490
00:25:41,714 --> 00:25:43,585
It means the world to me.

491
00:26:15,748 --> 00:26:18,489
- For those of you that don't
know the words of this song,

492
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:21,449
it says "We are Heiltsuk,
We are strong.

493
00:26:23,494 --> 00:26:27,107
We are proud.
We are good-looking." Woo!

494
00:26:29,457 --> 00:26:31,764
So, that's to you, Josiah.

495
00:26:31,807 --> 00:26:33,330
- Thank you very much.
Thank you so much. Thank you.

496
00:26:35,724 --> 00:26:38,118
It's just tough for him
because he got robbed.

497
00:26:38,161 --> 00:26:41,382
Like, it hurts him.
Like, he'll never forget this.

498
00:26:41,425 --> 00:26:44,298
He got robbed of what,
three years now?

499
00:26:44,341 --> 00:26:46,953
Four.
- Four years,

500
00:26:46,996 --> 00:26:49,129
four years of basketball.

501
00:26:49,172 --> 00:26:52,349
One of things that got him
excited was to go to the...

502
00:26:52,393 --> 00:26:54,700
All Native, to us,
is the biggest thing for us.

503
00:26:54,743 --> 00:26:57,354
It's the most exciting thing,
one time of the year.

504
00:26:57,398 --> 00:27:00,270
We call it second Christmas,
right, like,

505
00:27:00,314 --> 00:27:02,751
that's how much we love
the All Native.

506
00:27:02,795 --> 00:27:04,971
He got an unfair shot right,
like,

507
00:27:05,014 --> 00:27:07,626
that's all he's ever known
is Heiltsuk.

508
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:11,238
He's never known, really,
his other side until... what?

509
00:27:13,414 --> 00:27:15,068
- Until I was older.
- Yeah, yeah.

510
00:27:15,111 --> 00:27:17,157
- Even then it wasn't like,
I didn't,

511
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,202
I didn't know them the same
was as I did for Bella Bella.

512
00:27:19,246 --> 00:27:20,987
Like, I'd go to Haiti,
but it was like,

513
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:23,119
my Mom's Grandma has
an orphanage over there,

514
00:27:23,163 --> 00:27:25,121
so it's not like I'm going
to see my blood family.

515
00:27:25,165 --> 00:27:27,167
Like, they all passed away,
and stuff like that.

516
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:29,865
So, I mean, I don't,
when I go to Haiti, it's a trip,

517
00:27:29,909 --> 00:27:31,737
it's a vacation for me,
you know what I'm saying?

518
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,564
When I come out here,
yeah, it's a vacation,

519
00:27:33,608 --> 00:27:35,566
but I'm coming out here
to see family and stuff,

520
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:38,091
so, it's, it's two different
ways I see it.

521
00:27:38,134 --> 00:27:39,788
- It's good to see you though,
man.

522
00:27:39,832 --> 00:27:42,095
You too.
Good to see you.

523
00:27:42,138 --> 00:27:44,184
- Glad you're good.
- Thank you, you too.

524
00:27:44,227 --> 00:27:46,621
- At least you didn't get that
bad of a depression anyway.

525
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,057
Could've went a whole
different way.

526
00:27:48,101 --> 00:27:50,016
- Mm-hmm.
- Right?

527
00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:51,931
- Wasn't too bad, like--
- At least you stayed positive.

528
00:27:51,974 --> 00:27:53,802
- Mm-hmm. I tried to,
- That's the good part.

529
00:27:53,846 --> 00:27:55,369
as much as I could. It was an
honour being on their team.

530
00:27:56,849 --> 00:27:58,633
- Our team.
- Our team.

531
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,287
Yeah, our team.

532
00:29:32,509 --> 00:29:33,989
Amen.

533
00:30:14,943 --> 00:30:17,946
<i>Coming to Prince Rupert
is a bit of an ordeal.</i>

534
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:20,514
<i>If there was going to be
a public apology,</i>

535
00:30:20,557 --> 00:30:23,517
<i>that totally makes it worth it
to come all this way.</i>

536
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,563
<i>What is disappointing
is the lack of willingness</i>

537
00:30:26,607 --> 00:30:29,784
<i>to take accountability
for what they've done to him,</i>

538
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,656
<i>to his family, to his Nation,</i>

539
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,094
<i>to our elected leadership.</i>

540
00:30:35,137 --> 00:30:39,011
<i>They actually threatened
to ban the Heiltsuk team</i>

541
00:30:39,054 --> 00:30:42,753
<i>if we included something
like a welcome back gesture,</i>

542
00:30:42,797 --> 00:30:46,148
<i>for Josiah, and or,
a washing ceremony.</i>

543
00:31:01,468 --> 00:31:06,081
Defence!

544
00:31:13,523 --> 00:31:15,395
- Let's go! Go!
- Woo!

545
00:31:24,708 --> 00:31:29,626
Defence!

546
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,986
- They're switching everything.
That's what we've gotta do

547
00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:43,118
every time on that top side,
right.

548
00:31:43,162 --> 00:31:44,990
We've gotta make them make
decisions, right.

549
00:31:45,033 --> 00:31:46,643
If you're having
to pick up the ball,

550
00:31:46,687 --> 00:31:48,384
they're making sloppy
passes now.

551
00:31:48,428 --> 00:31:50,386
Continue to fight through.
Call those screws.

552
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:53,041
<i>Count on everything.</i>

553
00:31:53,085 --> 00:31:54,782
<i>This was like the big,
the big year for me,</i>

554
00:31:54,825 --> 00:31:56,392
<i>you know what I'm saying,
like I,</i>

555
00:31:56,436 --> 00:31:58,829
<i>I got a couple years they said
I couldn't play.</i>

556
00:31:58,873 --> 00:32:01,963
<i>Like, just a lot of work,
and time,</i>

557
00:32:02,007 --> 00:32:04,052
<i>and effort came to like,
this year.</i>

558
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,141
<i>And then, I thought they
was gonna do the ceremony</i>

559
00:32:06,185 --> 00:32:08,056
<i>and all that,
and now they're not.</i>

560
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,016
<i>Nothing. They didn't even
follow through with nothing.</i>

561
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:13,148
<i>Other than saying that
I can come back and play.</i>

562
00:32:14,845 --> 00:32:17,022
<i>They put a big damper on me,
like,</i>

563
00:32:17,065 --> 00:32:19,720
<i>I've low-key kind of lost
hope for it.</i>

564
00:32:19,763 --> 00:32:21,548
<i>Like, I don't, I have no idea
what's happening anymore.</i>

565
00:32:26,074 --> 00:32:29,034
- Man, you playing?
- Huh? Not this year,

566
00:32:29,077 --> 00:32:30,992
I got surgery over the summer,
so I'm in recovery.

567
00:32:31,036 --> 00:32:33,255
It's alright.

568
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:35,040
It's, in the cold it
hurts because I mean,

569
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:36,824
I've got a metal pole
in my foot,

570
00:32:36,867 --> 00:32:38,478
so when I get cold out
I feel it a lot,

571
00:32:38,521 --> 00:32:40,306
but right now,
I'm okay.

572
00:32:40,349 --> 00:32:42,438
It's just more recovery,

573
00:32:42,482 --> 00:32:44,005
but hopefully I'll be playing
next year.

574
00:32:45,572 --> 00:32:47,704
- Hello.
- Hey, what's up, man?

575
00:32:47,748 --> 00:32:49,706
- How ya doin'?
- How ya doin'? Good.

576
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,839
- I'm good. How you doing?
I like your trainers.

577
00:32:51,882 --> 00:32:53,667
I'm not, not on TV right now,
but it will be.

578
00:32:55,495 --> 00:32:57,714
We're filming for the future.

579
00:32:57,758 --> 00:33:00,935
- Filming for the future?
- Yeah, man.

580
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,024
- That's cool.
- Yeah, I know.
- That's lit.

581
00:33:03,068 --> 00:33:05,766
<i>- Check out my nigger, Mark.
Ha ha.</i>

582
00:33:06,854 --> 00:33:08,116
<i>My nigga--</i>

583
00:33:12,207 --> 00:33:13,730
<i>- What the hell?</i>

584
00:33:15,906 --> 00:33:17,734
Honestly,
it's gotten to the point

585
00:33:17,778 --> 00:33:19,910
where everybody be using
the word nigger nowadays,

586
00:33:19,954 --> 00:33:21,651
like I know so many people that
ain't niggers, they be like,

587
00:33:21,695 --> 00:33:24,089
bro, you the pastiest thing
alive, what do you mean?

588
00:33:24,132 --> 00:33:26,917
They all used the word,
trust me.

589
00:33:26,961 --> 00:33:28,876
I've kind of just accepted it.

590
00:33:35,143 --> 00:33:37,885
- I'm guessing, yes.

591
00:33:37,928 --> 00:33:40,061
Any dip in there, Ken,
for veggies?

592
00:33:41,715 --> 00:33:43,499
- Whoa!

593
00:33:43,543 --> 00:33:45,675
- I don't know what that is.

594
00:33:45,719 --> 00:33:47,677
- White people food.
- Mm-hmm.

595
00:33:49,984 --> 00:33:51,986
- You are what you eat.

596
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,728
- Oh, brother!

597
00:33:54,771 --> 00:33:57,122
Oh!
- How are you?

598
00:33:58,993 --> 00:34:01,082
- Oh, it's nice to see you.
- It's good to see you, too.

599
00:34:01,126 --> 00:34:03,693
- You doin' okay?
- Yeah.
- So am I.

600
00:34:03,737 --> 00:34:05,782
- Good stuff. Yeah.
- Uh huh.

601
00:34:05,826 --> 00:34:08,524
- Well, I'm happy to see you.

602
00:34:08,568 --> 00:34:10,352
- Do you know what time
I've been up since?

603
00:34:10,396 --> 00:34:12,093
- I know but--

604
00:34:12,137 --> 00:34:13,921
- Yeah, a 12, 24-hour boat ride.
- Good.

605
00:34:17,664 --> 00:34:19,405
<i>- Initially when I booked
my flight,</i>

606
00:34:19,448 --> 00:34:22,234
there was this plan that there
would be something happening

607
00:34:22,277 --> 00:34:24,758
actually with the tournament
itself, like some sort of,

608
00:34:24,801 --> 00:34:28,283
they would provide some time
before, after, or during a game,

609
00:34:28,327 --> 00:34:30,677
sort of officially
with the tournament.

610
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,722
<i>With the committee refusing</i>

611
00:34:32,766 --> 00:34:35,247
<i>to acknowledge anything
publicly,</i>

612
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:38,293
<i>it doesn't feel done to me,
but that's frustrating.</i>

613
00:34:38,337 --> 00:34:41,340
How long did it, what time
were you guys there,

614
00:34:41,383 --> 00:34:43,168
like half an hour?
- Where, in Bella?

615
00:34:43,211 --> 00:34:45,126
- No, no in like--
- The room?

616
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:46,997
The ceremony, yeah.
What about, not the ceremony,

617
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:48,999
but you know what I mean.
- I don't even know.

618
00:34:49,043 --> 00:34:50,740
Couple minutes, like,
10, 20 minutes maybe.

619
00:34:50,784 --> 00:34:53,178
- Okay.
- It wasn't the longest thing.

620
00:34:53,221 --> 00:34:54,962
- No, but it was nice.
- It was just a quick thing.

621
00:34:55,005 --> 00:34:56,572
- Oh, that's good!

622
00:34:56,616 --> 00:34:58,835
- No, I am so grateful
for what they did.

623
00:34:58,879 --> 00:35:01,186
Because I just wish
I could've been there.

624
00:35:01,229 --> 00:35:03,144
- That's awesome. Yeah, me too.
That would've been neat.

625
00:35:03,188 --> 00:35:06,321
I'm not, I didn't really
miss the like,

626
00:35:06,365 --> 00:35:08,584
19-hour ferry ride,
to be honest.

627
00:35:08,628 --> 00:35:10,847
-
- You didn't miss nothin'.

628
00:35:10,891 --> 00:35:12,806
- Thank you, thank you,
thank you

629
00:35:12,849 --> 00:35:15,025
to everybody for coming
and being here today.

630
00:35:15,069 --> 00:35:17,680
Something that my daughter
and I talk about all the time

631
00:35:17,724 --> 00:35:19,856
that we're lacking,
we're missing here

632
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,163
is just this family connections.

633
00:35:22,207 --> 00:35:25,775
- Love you all, and thank you
for supporting my boy,

634
00:35:25,819 --> 00:35:28,822
and with what he's been
going through.

635
00:35:28,865 --> 00:35:31,172
It's been a very um, it's been
quite the rollercoaster.

636
00:35:31,216 --> 00:35:33,174
- Yes.

637
00:35:33,218 --> 00:35:35,220
Yeah, I'm glad we can
all be here.

638
00:35:35,263 --> 00:35:38,179
And Liette, flying all the way
from Calgary today,

639
00:35:38,223 --> 00:35:40,268
Li getting up at four
in the morning.

640
00:35:40,312 --> 00:35:42,444
See, your parents,

641
00:35:42,488 --> 00:35:44,446
you might think your parents
might love you a bit.

642
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:46,883
- Yeah.
-

643
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:04,074
- I think it's, I feel like
maybe it's in the summertime.

644
00:36:04,118 --> 00:36:05,815
- Huh?

645
00:36:05,859 --> 00:36:07,643
- I think it's maybe
in the summertime,

646
00:36:07,687 --> 00:36:09,210
but I have no idea. I'll have
to check when I get back.

647
00:36:09,254 --> 00:36:10,907
- Okay.

648
00:36:18,393 --> 00:36:20,221
- Jasmine.

649
00:36:20,265 --> 00:36:22,919
Jasmine can you come here
for a minute, please?

650
00:36:22,963 --> 00:36:24,312
- They're struggling without
you.

651
00:36:25,879 --> 00:36:27,968
They'd like to hear Creole,

652
00:36:28,011 --> 00:36:29,622
so can you two talk
about something?

653
00:36:29,665 --> 00:36:31,667
- Or hey, you and my Dad
go ahead.

654
00:36:31,711 --> 00:36:33,408
Yeah, you and Don go ahead,

655
00:36:33,452 --> 00:36:34,801
because you guys
are better than me.

656
00:36:47,292 --> 00:36:48,945
- I understand. I understand
it; I don't speak.

657
00:36:54,995 --> 00:36:56,736
- Uh, A, took me out of
my beautiful country

658
00:36:56,779 --> 00:36:59,304
and brought me to the Badlands.

659
00:36:59,347 --> 00:37:00,957
Nobody speaks Creole here, yo,
how am I supposed to speak?

660
00:37:09,052 --> 00:37:11,490
Because we wanted them to have
that linguistic connections.

661
00:37:11,533 --> 00:37:15,276
So, it's ironic like,
I speak English, French,

662
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,671
Haitian Creole,
uh, a fair amount of Spanish,

663
00:37:18,714 --> 00:37:20,542
and American Sign Language,

664
00:37:20,586 --> 00:37:23,110
and tiny bit of Heiltsuk.

665
00:37:23,153 --> 00:37:26,505
I just wish I could speak
my original,

666
00:37:26,548 --> 00:37:30,683
my Aboriginal language
better than I speak it,

667
00:37:30,726 --> 00:37:33,294
but no opportunity.
I had way more opportunity

668
00:37:33,338 --> 00:37:35,470
to learn other languages
than my own.

669
00:37:35,514 --> 00:37:37,167
- And that's what they did
to me.

670
00:37:37,211 --> 00:37:39,082
They took me out of my native
language place

671
00:37:39,126 --> 00:37:41,128
and brought me up.

672
00:37:41,171 --> 00:37:43,304
- Josiah, that's why you speak
French, and then,

673
00:37:43,348 --> 00:37:45,088
when you go back to Haiti,
people can understand you.

674
00:37:45,132 --> 00:37:46,829
- Well, they look at me like,
man,

675
00:37:46,873 --> 00:37:48,788
what are you talkin' about?
- Yeah.

676
00:37:48,831 --> 00:37:51,051
- It's sad. It's not the same.

677
00:37:54,968 --> 00:37:56,883
- Oh, that flash was...!
-

678
00:37:56,926 --> 00:37:59,059
- Did it work?

679
00:37:59,102 --> 00:38:00,843
Okay, Josiah is the hard one
to see.

680
00:38:07,241 --> 00:38:09,374
My opinion, they're
just failing to recognize

681
00:38:09,417 --> 00:38:11,898
the human beings on the other
side of those rules.

682
00:38:11,941 --> 00:38:14,248
Rules are, they're necessary,

683
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,598
you can't have a functional
tournament without rules,

684
00:38:16,642 --> 00:38:18,905
but on the other hand,

685
00:38:18,948 --> 00:38:21,429
there's sort of a rigidity

686
00:38:21,473 --> 00:38:23,823
and a lack of compassion

687
00:38:23,866 --> 00:38:26,347
regarding who is on the other
side of those rules.

688
00:38:28,218 --> 00:38:31,352
This whole experience has
been eye-opening, you know.

689
00:38:33,223 --> 00:38:35,400
- Tell me about it.
- Indigenous politics are,

690
00:38:35,443 --> 00:38:37,184
are complicated to begin with,

691
00:38:37,227 --> 00:38:39,534
and then you add Nation
allegiances

692
00:38:39,578 --> 00:38:41,623
and personalities,

693
00:38:43,886 --> 00:38:45,932
it's all, it is what it is.

694
00:38:47,412 --> 00:38:48,978
- Wow that sun is really
killing you.

695
00:38:49,022 --> 00:38:51,372
- It's hitting my eye,
like right in my eyes.

696
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,941
- Jos, you're gonna get black.

697
00:38:54,984 --> 00:38:57,770
- Hopefully.

698
00:38:57,813 --> 00:38:59,989
- You're gonna get darker.
- Hopefully.

699
00:39:00,033 --> 00:39:02,122
See, if you keep wearing
that jacket you're,

700
00:39:02,165 --> 00:39:03,863
you're gonna run out
of Vitamin D.

701
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:08,302
You need the sun on your skin
to get Vitamin D.

702
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,130
- I'll take medicine.

703
00:39:10,173 --> 00:39:12,393
- This is, this is your doctor
father speaking to you.

704
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,006
- He might know a thing or two.
- I think you guys need

705
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:18,530
a little bit more Vitamin D,
than me.

706
00:39:37,636 --> 00:39:39,551
<i>It was nice
to be back and see</i>

707
00:39:39,594 --> 00:39:41,422
<i>all the homies and everything,
but at the same time,</i>

708
00:39:41,466 --> 00:39:43,206
<i>it was like, I don't know
if I wanna be part</i>

709
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:45,905
<i>of such a negative thing,
you know?</i>

710
00:39:49,691 --> 00:39:51,693
<i>Our Hereditary Chiefs
are not satisfied</i>

711
00:39:51,737 --> 00:39:53,956
<i>at leaving it there.</i>

712
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,828
<i>Their desire and preference is</i>

713
00:39:55,871 --> 00:39:58,613
<i>to have a proper washing
ceremony for Josiah done</i>

714
00:39:58,657 --> 00:40:01,268
<i>in Bella Bella,
in the fall of 2019,</i>

715
00:40:02,791 --> 00:40:05,925
<i>to do it in our own territory.</i>

716
00:40:05,968 --> 00:40:09,494
<i>In some ways, it's gonna be
that much more powerful.</i>

717
00:40:24,117 --> 00:40:27,294
- Ariane, this one's even
better! Come check this!

718
00:40:27,337 --> 00:40:29,165
- Hey, Mariah,
I'm in a really big rush.

719
00:40:29,209 --> 00:40:30,689
I have leave in 10 minutes.
- Man!

720
00:40:32,386 --> 00:40:34,301
Josiah was the cutest one
out of all four of us.

721
00:40:35,694 --> 00:40:37,347
Then, I don't know
what happened.

722
00:40:37,391 --> 00:40:39,349
At least he's actually legit
smiling 'cause like,

723
00:40:39,393 --> 00:40:41,264
there are times that honestly,

724
00:40:41,308 --> 00:40:43,484
smiling for Josiah
was like, not a thing.

725
00:40:43,528 --> 00:40:45,573
I guess every child
that gets adopted,

726
00:40:45,617 --> 00:40:48,881
they seem to have
different reactions.

727
00:40:50,491 --> 00:40:51,840
<i>Sometimes they have different
way of coping</i>

728
00:40:51,884 --> 00:40:54,016
<i>through different situations,
and for Josiah,</i>

729
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,323
<i>he's never really been great
at expressing himself.</i>

730
00:41:00,066 --> 00:41:02,024
That's Josiah
with his Papa.

731
00:41:02,068 --> 00:41:04,592
That's who he was closest to.

732
00:41:04,636 --> 00:41:07,290
I guess probably
his favourite person.

733
00:41:09,945 --> 00:41:11,773
They always knew, and we always
talked about it,

734
00:41:11,817 --> 00:41:13,732
and we talked about how they
came to join our family.

735
00:41:13,775 --> 00:41:16,038
Mariah always had her
biological father in Haiti;

736
00:41:16,082 --> 00:41:17,736
we used to be able to go
and visit him

737
00:41:17,779 --> 00:41:20,216
and spend time with him.
And Josiah,

738
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,175
<i>both of his birth parents
had passed away,</i>

739
00:41:22,218 --> 00:41:24,046
<i>so there was definitely
a sense of, sort of,</i>

740
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:26,005
<i>a real sense of loss
in his life.</i>

741
00:41:26,048 --> 00:41:28,355
<i>I think that's pretty normal
for adoptive kids</i>

742
00:41:28,398 --> 00:41:30,400
<i>to have to work through that in
various stages of their life,</i>

743
00:41:30,444 --> 00:41:32,838
<i>as they mature.</i>

744
00:41:32,881 --> 00:41:35,188
It's like an onion, you don't
just deal with it once.

745
00:41:40,628 --> 00:41:42,587
<i>I didn't even get
to really talk to my Mama</i>

746
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:44,458
<i>because I mean,
she passed away so quick.</i>

747
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:47,417
I've always just had an image
that my Mama and my Papa

748
00:41:47,461 --> 00:41:49,202
are always watching over me.
So, I mean,

749
00:41:49,245 --> 00:41:51,030
I believe they're
watching over me.

750
00:41:55,077 --> 00:41:58,211
- Anything that my biological
children would have

751
00:41:58,254 --> 00:42:00,343
according to Canadian law,

752
00:42:00,387 --> 00:42:03,259
my adoptive children
also have the right too.

753
00:42:03,303 --> 00:42:05,610
So, that's why
they all have status,

754
00:42:05,653 --> 00:42:07,612
and people are like, "Oh, I
never thought of it that way."

755
00:42:07,655 --> 00:42:10,092
- And I think the other thing
is like, Indigeneity

756
00:42:10,136 --> 00:42:13,618
is not necessarily blood.
- Blood, right.

757
00:42:13,661 --> 00:42:16,055
- It's not blood, it's like,
involvement in your community.

758
00:42:16,098 --> 00:42:19,667
It's like, informing people,
it's having like a pride

759
00:42:19,711 --> 00:42:21,408
and like, knowing your culture.
- Yeah.

760
00:42:21,451 --> 00:42:23,584
- It's not just,
"Oh, I'm full Native,

761
00:42:23,628 --> 00:42:25,847
I'm 100%," like,
that's kind of weird.

762
00:42:25,891 --> 00:42:28,807
Blood just doesn't constitute
being an Indigenous person,

763
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:31,244
fully to me.

764
00:42:31,287 --> 00:42:33,594
And a lot of like,
our questions about um,

765
00:42:33,638 --> 00:42:35,422
being Heiltsuk are always gonna
come back to us being,

766
00:42:35,465 --> 00:42:37,598
white passing.
- Yeah.

767
00:42:37,642 --> 00:42:40,209
- For sure, because to me,
I do feel

768
00:42:40,253 --> 00:42:42,081
a responsibility to my
community

769
00:42:42,124 --> 00:42:44,823
but I also almost feel like
I don't have a say,

770
00:42:44,866 --> 00:42:46,651
and I don't want to centre
myself in these discussions.

771
00:42:46,694 --> 00:42:48,087
What is this white girl doing?

772
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:50,176
Talking about our issues,

773
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:52,439
centring yourself on our issues,

774
00:42:52,482 --> 00:42:54,833
when she's not living
the same experiences as us.

775
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,880
Obviously, in terms of like,
my ancestry and my Dad,

776
00:42:58,924 --> 00:43:02,057
like I am in Indigenous person
but I don't look like one.

777
00:43:02,101 --> 00:43:04,669
I can very easily navigate
like, the world,

778
00:43:04,712 --> 00:43:07,410
in way that I could pretend
that I am not Indigenous at all.

779
00:43:07,454 --> 00:43:09,935
- I had this teacher
in elementary, I think,

780
00:43:09,978 --> 00:43:12,198
that didn't believe me
I was First Nations,

781
00:43:12,241 --> 00:43:15,027
for some reason,
just super strange.

782
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:17,638
And like, the next day
I brought my status card

783
00:43:17,682 --> 00:43:20,902
to school, she was like,
"Oh, like..." you know,

784
00:43:20,946 --> 00:43:23,252
because I don't look it, right.
So, I mean, it does happen.

785
00:43:25,515 --> 00:43:28,344
<i>But there's a sense of like,
resentfulness</i>

786
00:43:28,388 --> 00:43:31,434
when it comes to being white.
Do I personally want

787
00:43:31,478 --> 00:43:34,133
to identify more with
or whatever, right.

788
00:43:34,176 --> 00:43:37,136
And it's a tough question
and I feel like I always

789
00:43:37,179 --> 00:43:39,138
<i>kind of struggle with it.</i>

790
00:43:39,181 --> 00:43:41,662
- Josiah, you were very cute.
We were watching baby pictures.

791
00:43:41,706 --> 00:43:43,446
- I know I was cute.
Y'all always tell me that.

792
00:43:44,883 --> 00:43:46,928
- Why you always so mad?
Just be happy.

793
00:43:46,972 --> 00:43:48,930
- Yeah, and I was lying on the
ground and you were next to me,

794
00:43:48,974 --> 00:43:50,845
Josiah, and I just put my arm
around you like,

795
00:43:50,889 --> 00:43:52,673
"Josiah," just gonna lie there.

796
00:43:52,717 --> 00:43:54,675
- Josiah, you actually
used to love me.

797
00:43:54,719 --> 00:43:57,069
You were always, you were
playing trucks in my face,

798
00:43:57,112 --> 00:43:59,332
and you were trying to get
me to play trucks.

799
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:01,595
- Yeah, yeah, the keyword,
they keyword, "loved".

800
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,684
- Isn't that sad, though?
- No, not really.

801
00:44:03,728 --> 00:44:05,686
- I'm sad about it.

802
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:07,775
- Like, I remember in high
school, he would like,

803
00:44:07,819 --> 00:44:09,995
protect me from like, the big,
scary people who would like,

804
00:44:10,038 --> 00:44:11,866
make fun of me, or they would
like, say things to me

805
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:13,694
that were offensive,
and he'd be like,

806
00:44:13,738 --> 00:44:15,130
"Oh, you're gonna talk
to my sister like that?

807
00:44:15,174 --> 00:44:17,567
And [grumbles]" And kinda like,
scare them away.

808
00:44:17,611 --> 00:44:19,657
So, he definitely cares
about me and I know that.

809
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,920
- If anything happens in this
thing, you know what I'm sayin',

810
00:44:21,963 --> 00:44:23,791
it ain't 'cause of her,
it's 'cause of me.

811
00:44:23,835 --> 00:44:25,706
- Josiah.
- So just know.

812
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:27,708
- This would not have
happened without Dad

813
00:44:27,752 --> 00:44:29,797
and us pushing you to do it
to begin with.

814
00:44:29,841 --> 00:44:32,321
- My nigga, it would've
happened either way.

815
00:44:34,541 --> 00:44:36,456
You know why?

816
00:44:36,499 --> 00:44:38,763
'Cause the world needs
to know that I am--

817
00:44:38,806 --> 00:44:40,416
- This is not your attitude!

818
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:42,201
You're just stunting
for cameras.

819
00:44:42,244 --> 00:44:44,420
- I'm just talking outta my ass.
- Stunting for the camera.

820
00:44:44,464 --> 00:44:46,771
- Always talking outta my ass.
She's been knowing that shit.

821
00:44:46,814 --> 00:44:48,598
- Okay, well, you promised me
a hug from this morning.

822
00:44:48,642 --> 00:44:50,470
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah, ya did.

823
00:44:50,513 --> 00:44:52,646
- My nigger--
- If I change numbers.

824
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,257
Yeah, you did!
You promised. Oh.

825
00:44:55,301 --> 00:44:57,607
- Now, hey, listen to me.
- I love you.

826
00:44:57,651 --> 00:45:00,045
- Get outta here!
- Gotta get one more!

827
00:45:00,088 --> 00:45:02,743
- Come on!
That was your turn!

828
00:45:02,787 --> 00:45:05,833
- Oh, can I get one on
the, when I'm back?

829
00:45:05,877 --> 00:45:07,530
- We'll see how ya did!

830
00:45:09,184 --> 00:45:11,447
See what I mean
by tough love?

831
00:45:11,491 --> 00:45:14,450
- Anyway, I love him.
He's my brother, so.

832
00:45:16,104 --> 00:45:17,453
- And he puts on like,
a brave face for everything,

833
00:45:17,497 --> 00:45:19,368
like he won't, even like,

834
00:45:19,412 --> 00:45:21,588
I don't think I've seen him cry

835
00:45:21,631 --> 00:45:23,938
since probably
my Grandpa passed away,

836
00:45:23,982 --> 00:45:26,462
and even that was like,
one tear. He just like,

837
00:45:26,506 --> 00:45:28,595
he might have cried
in private and stuff,

838
00:45:28,638 --> 00:45:30,902
but he's like, like really,
really private

839
00:45:30,945 --> 00:45:32,599
and he doesn't really share
his emotions, at least with us.

840
00:45:34,644 --> 00:45:36,168
♪ Jesus loves me

841
00:45:36,211 --> 00:45:38,997
♪ Yes, he does love me

842
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:44,785
Ah, ici, Ariane.
- Ariane! Hey.

843
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:46,047
Hey. Ariane!

844
00:45:46,091 --> 00:45:48,310
That's not nice.

845
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:55,796
- Hold up. Hi, hi, hi!
-

846
00:46:15,685 --> 00:46:17,513
- Ah!
- Yeah!
- Ah!

847
00:46:20,038 --> 00:46:21,909
- Whoa, Jos!

848
00:46:28,655 --> 00:46:31,614
<i>- Um, I've asked you
a few times</i>

849
00:46:31,658 --> 00:46:34,313
<i>but can you talk
about your Dad?</i>

850
00:46:34,356 --> 00:46:37,446
- I mean, we can maybe talk
about him. Not today.

851
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:38,970
- Not today?
- Maybe another day.

852
00:46:39,013 --> 00:46:40,841
<i>- Okay.</i>

853
00:46:42,495 --> 00:46:44,627
- I don't know we,
we had our differences.

854
00:46:44,671 --> 00:46:47,587
You know, I dunno, stuff
happened in the past.

855
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:50,503
We kinda, I kinda just didn't
accept stuff

856
00:46:50,546 --> 00:46:52,722
and got upset.

857
00:46:52,766 --> 00:46:55,769
And I, I just kinda did
my own thing, really.

858
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:58,859
But... I dunno,
life happens, really.

859
00:47:00,905 --> 00:47:03,733
We fight too much, honestly.
Like, I, I'm honestly,

860
00:47:03,777 --> 00:47:05,474
I'm just an instigator
with my family.

861
00:47:05,518 --> 00:47:07,825
I'm always starting
some shit, yo.

862
00:47:07,868 --> 00:47:10,262
I don't even know why half
the time, I just, I dunno,

863
00:47:10,305 --> 00:47:12,090
I'm an instigator
for some reason.

864
00:47:12,133 --> 00:47:13,874
I'm always, there's always
some shit goin' down

865
00:47:13,918 --> 00:47:15,615
and I'm always in the middle
of it.

866
00:47:15,658 --> 00:47:17,486
It's always Josiah
and this, Josiah and that.

867
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:20,272
But so, we figured out
that like,

868
00:47:20,315 --> 00:47:22,578
the best thing for us,

869
00:47:22,622 --> 00:47:24,537
I just stay away from them
and we all be good.

870
00:47:26,017 --> 00:47:27,540
I don't go out instigating
everybody,

871
00:47:27,583 --> 00:47:29,542
just like really
my siblings mainly.

872
00:47:29,585 --> 00:47:31,283
But I don't know, there's
something about the way

873
00:47:31,326 --> 00:47:34,373
they react it just,
oh, it gets me.

874
00:47:34,416 --> 00:47:37,376
Makes me happy.
I dunno.

875
00:47:37,419 --> 00:47:40,074
Me and Mariah, we had thing
goin' on when we was kids

876
00:47:40,118 --> 00:47:43,295
like, we was like, we was
honestly OG's and then,

877
00:47:43,338 --> 00:47:46,341
these white things came around.

878
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,562
Changed the whole game.

879
00:47:52,782 --> 00:47:54,828
<i>- And who? What are,
what are white things?</i>

880
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:57,526
- Ariane and Tevan! Yeah.

881
00:47:57,570 --> 00:48:00,442
Me and Mariah,
Liette and Don,

882
00:48:00,486 --> 00:48:02,575
were living good, y'all.
Know what I'm saying?

883
00:48:02,618 --> 00:48:05,056
Life was good.
We was out in Vancouver

884
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:07,841
doing our thing, me and Mariah
would eat some Cheerios

885
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:10,365
behind the toilet
at like 5:00 a.m. sometimes,

886
00:48:10,409 --> 00:48:12,324
you know. Just the way it was,
you know what I'm saying, like.

887
00:48:13,978 --> 00:48:15,936
And then we had some more kids.

888
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:18,156
Well, not we, but them. What?

889
00:48:18,199 --> 00:48:20,201
And then the house
just got packed, like,

890
00:48:20,245 --> 00:48:22,812
people everywhere and always
just, there was so much,

891
00:48:22,856 --> 00:48:24,640
there was just too much goin'
on all the time.

892
00:48:26,729 --> 00:48:29,341
Like, there was just never
a quiet place.

893
00:48:29,384 --> 00:48:30,864
It was kind of annoying
honestly, sometimes.

894
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:37,392
Honestly, I think ever since
my Grandpa passed away really,

895
00:48:37,436 --> 00:48:40,178
I was definitely that hurt,
that hurt a lot.

896
00:48:40,221 --> 00:48:43,833
But he was like the main,
he kept me in order, yo.

897
00:48:43,877 --> 00:48:45,574
He, he didn't like when I,
when I fought with the,

898
00:48:45,618 --> 00:48:47,446
with the other kids,
and stuff like that.

899
00:48:47,489 --> 00:48:50,057
So, he'd always keep me
straight. He'd be like, "Hey!"

900
00:48:50,101 --> 00:48:52,364
Whenever I'd start some shit,
he'd be like, "Josiah!"

901
00:48:54,018 --> 00:48:55,410
So, like, he kept me in order.
And then, like...

902
00:48:58,718 --> 00:49:00,850
don't mean I don't like him,
though.

903
00:49:00,894 --> 00:49:02,678
He's always gonna be my blood
and whatnot,

904
00:49:02,722 --> 00:49:06,160
but that dude piss me off
sometimes. I tell ya that.

905
00:49:18,346 --> 00:49:20,000
I might be playing now.

906
00:49:20,044 --> 00:49:21,480
So, I don't know what's
happening really,

907
00:49:21,523 --> 00:49:23,308
but I was on the phone
with them just now, so.

908
00:49:23,351 --> 00:49:25,832
We'll see what happens.

909
00:49:25,875 --> 00:49:29,009
<i>- Okay. So, you'd be playing
with the Heiltsuk team?</i>

910
00:49:29,053 --> 00:49:31,664
- Yeah, I guess so.
Okay, yo, um,

911
00:49:31,707 --> 00:49:34,101
I got a call today saying
that they want me to play

912
00:49:34,145 --> 00:49:35,929
for the tournament now.

913
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,323
Okay. Bella Bella?

914
00:49:38,366 --> 00:49:40,934
- Yeah, but I'm figuring it out.
Like, I messaged him.

915
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,980
I messaged the coach yesterday
and he's like,

916
00:49:43,023 --> 00:49:44,633
"Oh, I'll get back to you
this afternoon, so."

917
00:49:44,677 --> 00:49:46,418
- I would, I mean,
I would love to see you play

918
00:49:46,461 --> 00:49:48,333
in the tournament.
That would just go.

919
00:49:48,376 --> 00:49:49,682
- Yeah, I mean, I'm cool
with just going too,

920
00:49:49,725 --> 00:49:51,423
but alright, okay.

921
00:49:51,466 --> 00:49:53,468
- I know, but it's better
if you can play.

922
00:49:53,512 --> 00:49:56,036
- Let's get it!
- How does it feel?

923
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,125
- I mean, I don't know.
Good, I guess.

924
00:49:58,169 --> 00:50:00,301
I don't really have emotions
for it. Doesn't really faze me.

925
00:50:00,345 --> 00:50:02,956
It is what it is.

926
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,740
It was meant to happen.
I don't know.

927
00:50:06,742 --> 00:50:08,483
I'm not gonna say that like,
I'm overly excited or like,

928
00:50:08,527 --> 00:50:11,095
out of joy just for the... no.

929
00:50:11,138 --> 00:50:13,053
Cool, I'm playing ball.

930
00:50:13,097 --> 00:50:14,054
That's that.

931
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:51,787
- Oh, it be like that, though.
- It be like that.

932
00:50:51,831 --> 00:50:54,181
- I just, I literally
was chilling one day

933
00:50:54,225 --> 00:50:55,835
and I seen a nigger
and I was like,

934
00:50:55,878 --> 00:50:57,793
that kid right there,
that's my bro.

935
00:50:57,837 --> 00:50:59,534
And that's how it went.
- Is that how it went?

936
00:50:59,578 --> 00:51:01,580
- Pretty much.
- Yo, literally like,

937
00:51:01,623 --> 00:51:03,495
ever since we was young

938
00:51:03,538 --> 00:51:05,410
we either was gonna become
athletes

939
00:51:05,453 --> 00:51:07,368
or was gonna get into the music
industry or something.

940
00:51:07,412 --> 00:51:09,327
Like, I mean, we stuck by.

941
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:11,416
For the longest time we were
straight, we played,

942
00:51:11,459 --> 00:51:13,331
we played sports. Like,
the weed and all this shit,

943
00:51:13,374 --> 00:51:15,376
the lifestyle you guys see now,
man,

944
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:17,204
this came like years after
fucking high school, bro.

945
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:21,339
Yeah, no I'm going back now.
- What, to play?

946
00:51:21,382 --> 00:51:23,776
- Yeah. I got a call today.
- Have fun with your lungs.

947
00:51:23,819 --> 00:51:26,387
- Fuck me.
-

948
00:51:26,431 --> 00:51:29,260
- Better start that cardio.
- Better play half court, then.

949
00:51:29,303 --> 00:51:30,783
- Oh, Josiah, you're actually
trying to hoop again?

950
00:51:30,826 --> 00:51:32,785
- Hoop?
Oh, like, it's goin' down.

951
00:51:32,828 --> 00:51:35,353
Like, I'm going up.
- Yikes.

952
00:51:35,396 --> 00:51:37,006
- I wanna come watch.
WE should just go to watch.

953
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:38,878
- Fuck you, guys.

954
00:51:38,921 --> 00:51:42,055
Can I just say, bro, I'm sorry,
I'll give you a hoop mix tape.

955
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:44,971
- When he plays he's gonna
beyond fitted out of his mind
too,

956
00:51:45,014 --> 00:51:47,321
so like, you know, like--

957
00:51:47,365 --> 00:51:49,236
- I don't work out,
I don't run, I don't hoop,

958
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,021
I barely eat, I smoke weed.

959
00:51:52,065 --> 00:51:53,849
- Whadda ya mean ya barely?
That shit.

960
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:02,336
- Um,

961
00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:08,037
I think it's definitely like
harder when you're younger

962
00:52:08,081 --> 00:52:11,432
'cause you're a little bit
more unappreciative.

963
00:52:11,476 --> 00:52:15,088
'Cause I mean, for me,
'cause I was always thinking

964
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,438
that I still wanted my family
there

965
00:52:17,482 --> 00:52:20,180
and this wasn't really my
family here until like,

966
00:52:20,224 --> 00:52:21,877
I grew up and I started
appreciating

967
00:52:21,921 --> 00:52:23,966
what they actually do for me.

968
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:27,100
But for the most part
it's pretty good.

969
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:29,276
- It's kinda, it's kind of,
with the all Native shit,

970
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,235
I don't, I didn't really
know any different,

971
00:52:31,278 --> 00:52:32,975
you know what I'm sayin',
like this is how it was.

972
00:52:33,019 --> 00:52:34,586
Like, I had no other choice.

973
00:52:34,629 --> 00:52:36,457
So, it's like,
it is what it is.

974
00:52:36,501 --> 00:52:38,851
But like, I don't know,

975
00:52:38,894 --> 00:52:40,679
I'm not even gonna talk bad
about my parents or nothing,

976
00:52:40,722 --> 00:52:42,637
like I fucks with them but...

977
00:52:42,681 --> 00:52:45,118
I don't know there's definitely,

978
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,598
I dunno, something different
about it, y'all.

979
00:52:46,641 --> 00:52:48,904
Something's weird about it.

980
00:52:48,948 --> 00:52:52,821
- I don't think me personally,
I would do adoption though.

981
00:52:52,865 --> 00:52:55,389
Just from knowing
how I went through.

982
00:52:55,433 --> 00:52:57,304
- I don't think I would
personally.

983
00:52:57,348 --> 00:52:59,698
I've always thought about doing
it just because I feel like,

984
00:52:59,741 --> 00:53:01,656
okay, yeah, there are those
struggling kids out there,

985
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:03,615
and all that, that want,
like that need a family,

986
00:53:03,658 --> 00:53:05,443
but at the same time
it's like,

987
00:53:05,486 --> 00:53:07,314
I don't know if I wanna
do that to a kid.

988
00:53:07,358 --> 00:53:09,098
Like, I don't know, it's that
weird feeling like yeah,

989
00:53:09,142 --> 00:53:11,405
no, there's all the love and
everything there, but like--

990
00:53:11,449 --> 00:53:13,712
- It's not the same.

991
00:53:13,755 --> 00:53:16,062
- I feel like there's different
energy it being like,

992
00:53:16,105 --> 00:53:18,151
your legit blood,
you know what I'm saying.

993
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,458
And I could be wrong,
but I mean, that's how I feel.

994
00:53:20,501 --> 00:53:23,287
I just feel like there's
something different there
that's like--

995
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:24,331
- I just felt like it's like,

996
00:53:25,898 --> 00:53:27,247
like especially like for us,

997
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:32,339
you're not really gonna
know what that real Mom

998
00:53:32,383 --> 00:53:35,647
love feel like, or real Dad
love feel like.

999
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:37,910
- 'Cause you know
how whenever--

1000
00:53:37,953 --> 00:53:39,955
- Straight from your own blood,
you know what I mean.

1001
00:53:39,999 --> 00:53:41,740
- Cuz, you know, how every
Mother says there's like,

1002
00:53:41,783 --> 00:53:44,438
that motherly love? Like--
- Yeah. We don't have that.

1003
00:53:44,482 --> 00:53:48,312
- What mother? I don't know?
I haven't met. Cool.

1004
00:53:48,355 --> 00:53:49,835
- What is it, like you know
what I mean? Like, you know.

1005
00:53:49,878 --> 00:53:52,054
- I got the love that I got.

1006
00:53:52,098 --> 00:53:53,926
And I'm not saying it
was shitty,

1007
00:53:53,969 --> 00:53:56,233
I'm not saying there's like,
any better or wrong way,

1008
00:53:56,276 --> 00:53:58,278
but I mean like--
- You only knew one thing.

1009
00:53:58,322 --> 00:54:00,933
- Yeah, so I mean, you never,
- It was regular.

1010
00:54:00,976 --> 00:54:02,761
- There's a feel, there's
a tension, or something.

1011
00:54:02,804 --> 00:54:04,458
- Yeah.
- At the end of the day,

1012
00:54:04,502 --> 00:54:06,460
you know like,
we're different

1013
00:54:06,504 --> 00:54:09,463
- There's that image of niggers,
you know what I'm saying,

1014
00:54:09,507 --> 00:54:12,988
and I am a nigger.
And the way that I dress.

1015
00:54:13,032 --> 00:54:15,295
Like, the people,
like just my lifestyle,

1016
00:54:15,339 --> 00:54:17,993
I've got that image portrayed
around me, so it's like.

1017
00:54:19,734 --> 00:54:21,823
And then you've got my siblings
that are the good white kids,

1018
00:54:21,867 --> 00:54:24,173
you know what I'm saying.
So, it's like,

1019
00:54:24,217 --> 00:54:26,393
am I competing against them,
or what? Like--

1020
00:54:26,437 --> 00:54:28,917
I'm not gonna say they treated
us differently, but I just,

1021
00:54:28,961 --> 00:54:31,485
I don't know, just like,
the energy around us,

1022
00:54:31,529 --> 00:54:33,400
and like at times I've just,
I've noticed some.

1023
00:54:33,444 --> 00:54:35,968
But I don't know,
I guess it is what it is.

1024
00:55:00,471 --> 00:55:02,777
Back home in Bella Bella,

1025
00:55:02,821 --> 00:55:05,258
when we were growing up,
if you did something wrong

1026
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:06,825
with your fishing skills,
or whatever,

1027
00:55:06,868 --> 00:55:10,219
you got called a farmer.

1028
00:55:10,263 --> 00:55:13,440
So, I never dreamed
I would be doing this.

1029
00:55:13,484 --> 00:55:17,401
But it matches my philosophy
of raising your own food

1030
00:55:17,444 --> 00:55:19,446
and I'm a meat eater,

1031
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:22,188
so I like the idea of knowing
where it comes from.

1032
00:55:26,192 --> 00:55:28,150
I grew up in the 70s,
in Bella Bella.

1033
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,503
When I was growing up,

1034
00:55:32,546 --> 00:55:36,245
most of my exposure to religion
was the United Church

1035
00:55:36,289 --> 00:55:38,378
because we lived literally
across the street

1036
00:55:38,422 --> 00:55:41,294
from the United Church building.

1037
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:44,384
<i>Missionaries have been
involved in,</i>

1038
00:55:44,428 --> 00:55:47,387
<i>in my Nation since the 1800's
or maybe even earlier.</i>

1039
00:55:49,868 --> 00:55:52,566
<i>There had been uh, influence</i>

1040
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:54,351
<i>of more Evangelical
Christianity</i>

1041
00:55:54,394 --> 00:55:57,528
<i>that had some kind of
an impact on social norms</i>

1042
00:55:57,571 --> 00:56:00,444
<i>or social values becoming a
little bit more conservative</i>

1043
00:56:00,487 --> 00:56:03,403
<i>in that domain.</i>

1044
00:56:03,447 --> 00:56:06,798
<i>Religion became a bigger
thing for me</i>

1045
00:56:06,841 --> 00:56:10,105
after I left Bella Bella
and um,

1046
00:56:10,149 --> 00:56:11,933
<i>left and went away
for high school</i>

1047
00:56:11,977 --> 00:56:13,848
<i>and got more deeply involved.</i>

1048
00:56:15,546 --> 00:56:17,025
If you were LGBT,

1049
00:56:18,679 --> 00:56:20,725
which I actually didn't
know that I was

1050
00:56:20,768 --> 00:56:23,467
when I left Bella Bella
at age 14,

1051
00:56:23,510 --> 00:56:26,731
it took about a year
before I consciously realized

1052
00:56:26,774 --> 00:56:28,733
that I was gay,

1053
00:56:28,776 --> 00:56:30,822
but I couldn't accept it.

1054
00:56:32,693 --> 00:56:35,740
<i>And just as I became aware
that I was gay,</i>

1055
00:56:35,783 --> 00:56:38,438
<i>there was this big debate over
whether you were acceptable</i>

1056
00:56:38,482 --> 00:56:41,093
<i>as a person, or not.</i>

1057
00:56:41,136 --> 00:56:44,618
And so, I wasn't about
to come out of the closet.

1058
00:56:44,662 --> 00:56:48,230
And then I got in my
relationship with my ex-wife,

1059
00:56:48,274 --> 00:56:51,277
<i>with Liette,
and we fell in love</i>

1060
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:54,323
<i>and it was legit,
and got married,</i>

1061
00:56:54,367 --> 00:56:56,282
<i>because that's just what
you did back in those,</i>

1062
00:56:56,325 --> 00:56:58,545
<i>in those circles.</i>

1063
00:56:58,589 --> 00:57:01,548
You didn't prolong
a relationship um,

1064
00:57:01,592 --> 00:57:03,463
and move in together
without being married.

1065
00:57:03,507 --> 00:57:05,900
That was prohibited
by the church.

1066
00:57:05,944 --> 00:57:08,120
And that kinda took
precedence over my,

1067
00:57:08,163 --> 00:57:09,948
my Heiltsuk identity.

1068
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:15,170
Um, and it wasn't until
13 years into marriage

1069
00:57:15,214 --> 00:57:17,695
when I just couldn't,
couldn't um,

1070
00:57:19,348 --> 00:57:21,481
pretend to be something
that I wasn't anymore,

1071
00:57:21,525 --> 00:57:25,224
and then, came out and
we separated and divorced,

1072
00:57:25,267 --> 00:57:28,183
and sorted all of that out
afterwards.

1073
00:57:29,402 --> 00:57:31,056
Come here, Bella.

1074
00:57:31,099 --> 00:57:32,971
<i>But I feel like
I was railroaded</i>

1075
00:57:33,014 --> 00:57:35,495
<i>into that path of life</i>

1076
00:57:35,539 --> 00:57:37,845
<i>where you had to just follow
the evangelical</i>

1077
00:57:37,889 --> 00:57:40,326
<i>uh, script.</i>

1078
00:57:40,369 --> 00:57:43,503
I've completely discarded
and rejected all of that

1079
00:57:43,547 --> 00:57:46,288
because I feel like
it was so damaging.

1080
00:57:46,332 --> 00:57:48,769
Like, why can't you be
who you are?

1081
00:57:48,813 --> 00:57:51,337
<i>If there is a Creator,</i>

1082
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:54,035
<i>the Creator made me who
and what I am,</i>

1083
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:56,342
<i>and I'm not, I'm not gonna
try to mess with that.</i>

1084
00:58:09,355 --> 00:58:12,967
<i>As a gay man
with two partners,</i>

1085
00:58:13,011 --> 00:58:15,361
<i>a polyamorous triad
relationship,</i>

1086
00:58:15,404 --> 00:58:17,319
<i>well, that's my family.</i>

1087
00:58:22,194 --> 00:58:24,588
<i>In a lot of ways,
I, I live with that decision</i>

1088
00:58:24,631 --> 00:58:28,548
<i>to not come out of the closet
for so many years,</i>

1089
00:58:28,592 --> 00:58:30,637
<i>and how it impacted people,</i>

1090
00:58:30,681 --> 00:58:33,031
<i>especially Liette
and my children,</i>

1091
00:58:33,074 --> 00:58:35,468
<i>but on the other hand, like,
she's a remarkable person.</i>

1092
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:38,384
<i>I, I just think I, I,
I don't know,</i>

1093
00:58:38,427 --> 00:58:41,213
<i>I won the lottery
of the universe</i>

1094
00:58:41,256 --> 00:58:43,476
<i>having her as the Mother
of my children,</i>

1095
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,566
<i>because she's done
such a good job</i>

1096
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:49,177
<i>getting through all of that,
moving on with her life,</i>

1097
00:58:49,221 --> 00:58:53,007
<i>while maintaining a
relationship with someone who,</i>

1098
00:58:53,051 --> 00:58:55,923
<i>in a lot of ways,
although unintentionally,</i>

1099
00:58:55,967 --> 00:58:58,230
it was a betrayal.

1100
00:58:58,273 --> 00:59:01,407
So, you know, I feel bad
about that, even to this day,

1101
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:03,365
I probably will
to the day I die.

1102
00:59:04,932 --> 00:59:08,196
<i>So, in a lot of ways,
I felt very unburdened.</i>

1103
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:11,678
<i>And then, in other ways,
by doing so,</i>

1104
00:59:11,722 --> 00:59:14,986
<i>I just destroyed someone's
life,</i>

1105
00:59:15,029 --> 00:59:18,424
<i>namely my ex-wife, right,</i>

1106
00:59:18,467 --> 00:59:21,688
<i>and threatened the sort of
psychological stability</i>

1107
00:59:21,732 --> 00:59:24,430
<i>and well-being of my children
by initiating a divorce.</i>

1108
00:59:27,389 --> 00:59:29,304
<i>I don't doubt that Josiah
loves me.</i>

1109
00:59:29,348 --> 00:59:31,045
<i>I, I know he does,</i>

1110
00:59:31,089 --> 00:59:34,701
<i>um, but whether it's a,</i>

1111
00:59:34,745 --> 00:59:37,182
<i>it's a conflicted thing
that he has to go through,</i>

1112
00:59:38,705 --> 00:59:39,706
<i>that's his journey.</i>

1113
00:59:41,403 --> 00:59:43,841
<i>My, my journey was
conflicted as well.</i>

1114
00:59:43,884 --> 00:59:47,496
<i>So, I, I just hope that
eventually at some point</i>

1115
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:50,499
or other, he just comes
to realize that you don't,

1116
00:59:50,543 --> 00:59:52,501
you don't always get
to pick your family.

1117
00:59:52,545 --> 00:59:55,069
Sometimes you do,
but you don't usually.

1118
00:59:55,113 --> 00:59:57,245
So, it is what it is.

1119
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:29,887
This is Bella Bella.

1120
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:31,758
Honestly, for me, this is
the closest I get to Haiti,

1121
01:00:31,802 --> 01:00:33,760
'cause like, you've got water,
the weather's beautiful,

1122
01:00:33,804 --> 01:00:35,196
you got a little bit
of sunshine.

1123
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:37,546
Calgary, you got nothin'
of that.

1124
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:40,288
So, I mean, honestly,
feel, being here,

1125
01:00:40,332 --> 01:00:42,203
I'm like, this is like,
pretty much my second,

1126
01:00:42,247 --> 01:00:44,292
I'd say this is probably like
second closest home to Haiti.

1127
01:00:44,336 --> 01:00:46,512
So, for me, it's definitely
a vibe coming out here.

1128
01:00:46,555 --> 01:00:48,340
And I mean, just my Grandpa,
like, my Grandpa was like,

1129
01:00:48,383 --> 01:00:50,559
really the backbone of me
and all that.

1130
01:00:50,603 --> 01:00:52,561
So, just being here is like,
it just make,

1131
01:00:52,605 --> 01:00:53,911
I feel like I'm closer to him,
and all that.

1132
01:00:53,954 --> 01:00:55,608
And I mean like, his burial
is over there, so,

1133
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:58,524
I mean, yeah, no,
I flex with this place.

1134
01:00:58,567 --> 01:01:00,744
It's definitely,
it's definitely a spot.

1135
01:01:00,787 --> 01:01:03,485
Like, these people are homies;
they family, and all that.

1136
01:01:03,529 --> 01:01:05,009
So, it's dope.

1137
01:01:08,012 --> 01:01:10,797
I dunno, growing up,
after my parents got a divorce,

1138
01:01:10,841 --> 01:01:12,756
I was a really difficult child.

1139
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:14,801
Went through a bunch
of rough stages.

1140
01:01:14,845 --> 01:01:16,542
Fucked shit up.
Was really angry.

1141
01:01:16,585 --> 01:01:18,370
Just not happy with life
and just everything.

1142
01:01:18,413 --> 01:01:21,373
So um, ever since then,

1143
01:01:21,416 --> 01:01:24,724
I definitely pushed away
from my parents,

1144
01:01:24,768 --> 01:01:26,813
and I just like, I don't know,

1145
01:01:26,857 --> 01:01:28,728
I definitely made it a weird
situation with them, like,

1146
01:01:28,772 --> 01:01:31,165
from like, the age of probably
like, 12, 13,

1147
01:01:31,209 --> 01:01:33,037
'til I was like,

1148
01:01:35,256 --> 01:01:37,563
shit like, 18, 19,

1149
01:01:37,606 --> 01:01:39,347
maybe 20, 21,
something like that.

1150
01:01:40,958 --> 01:01:42,786
I was just a,
I was just a shit.

1151
01:01:42,829 --> 01:01:45,136
They pretty much like, ignited
the rowdiness in my life, yo.

1152
01:01:45,179 --> 01:01:48,008
If anything, it was on them.
I blame you!

1153
01:01:48,052 --> 01:01:50,445
Like, if it wasn't for them,
yo, I was a chill kid.

1154
01:01:50,489 --> 01:01:52,230
Somewhat chill,
you know what I'm saying.

1155
01:01:52,273 --> 01:01:54,362
Like, I was somewhat chill.
Life might've been different;

1156
01:01:54,406 --> 01:01:56,147
life might've not been
different.

1157
01:01:56,190 --> 01:01:57,975
Who knows what
would've happened

1158
01:01:58,018 --> 01:01:59,628
if I didn't go through the way,
life as I did,

1159
01:01:59,672 --> 01:02:01,630
you know what I'm saying, so.

1160
01:02:01,674 --> 01:02:03,458
And I've said
this multiple times,

1161
01:02:03,502 --> 01:02:05,591
if you ask me when I see
a family, I see,

1162
01:02:05,634 --> 01:02:08,681
I picture Mama, Papa,
junior, and sissy,

1163
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:10,814
alls chillin' under one roof,
you know what I'm saying.

1164
01:02:10,857 --> 01:02:13,947
That's how, that's how when,
and if you asked me

1165
01:02:13,991 --> 01:02:15,819
when I was 10 years old
or when I was younger.

1166
01:02:15,862 --> 01:02:17,821
If you ask me now, if you
ask me in like, 50 years,

1167
01:02:17,864 --> 01:02:21,999
when you ask me when I see a
family, that's what I see, like.

1168
01:02:22,042 --> 01:02:24,479
Or you could've asked me how,
how I would've wanted it to go,

1169
01:02:24,523 --> 01:02:26,873
I would've been like, no, don't,
like there's no break-ups,

1170
01:02:26,917 --> 01:02:28,440
like, shut the fuck up,
like, that's stupid.

1171
01:02:28,483 --> 01:02:30,659
But I mean, I, I can't tell
them to do that, you know.

1172
01:02:30,703 --> 01:02:34,402
So, it is what it is,
but yeah, no, yeah,

1173
01:02:34,446 --> 01:02:36,274
no that's pretty much it, like.

1174
01:02:38,537 --> 01:02:40,191
<i>- So, how did your, what
was the conversation like,</i>

1175
01:02:40,234 --> 01:02:44,021
<i>when your Dad, like,
came out to you guys?</i>

1176
01:02:44,064 --> 01:02:45,457
I don't know,
you'd have to ask him.

1177
01:02:47,111 --> 01:02:49,156
I try not to keep--remember
that shit in my life.

1178
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,898
I just toss that all out really.
I don't, I don't care about it.

1179
01:02:51,942 --> 01:02:54,074
Like, you'd have to ask him
if you really wanna know.

1180
01:02:54,118 --> 01:02:56,860
He could tell you, probably.
I honestly probably left

1181
01:02:56,903 --> 01:02:58,426
halfway through. I did,
I did leave halfway through,

1182
01:02:58,470 --> 01:03:00,298
so I really wouldn't know.
- Really?

1183
01:03:00,341 --> 01:03:02,343
- Yeah, I just, I was like,
nigger this is stupid as fuck,

1184
01:03:02,387 --> 01:03:04,563
like you're breaking up with my
Mom? Like, alright peace out.

1185
01:03:04,606 --> 01:03:06,695
I was just pissed off
and I left.

1186
01:03:06,739 --> 01:03:09,263
So, if you wanna know,
you can ask him, but...

1187
01:03:09,307 --> 01:03:11,570
I just dipped out.

1188
01:03:13,877 --> 01:03:15,879
It took him a lot of work
to get me to like,

1189
01:03:15,922 --> 01:03:17,881
start talking up again,
because I would not talk to him,

1190
01:03:17,924 --> 01:03:20,709
I wouldn't answer his calls.
Um,

1191
01:03:20,753 --> 01:03:23,712
I was just disappointed.

1192
01:03:23,756 --> 01:03:25,845
Coming from my situation,
not having parents

1193
01:03:25,889 --> 01:03:27,673
and just like having a Mom
pass away and all that shit,

1194
01:03:27,716 --> 01:03:30,328
and just finally getting
a family and all that,

1195
01:03:30,371 --> 01:03:33,679
and then, that just not working
on it and all that shit,

1196
01:03:33,722 --> 01:03:35,681
I'm not saying it's my fault,
but it's just fucked up.

1197
01:03:35,724 --> 01:03:37,726
So, I mean, it was
just the whole thing

1198
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:39,554
that was kinda fucked up for me.

1199
01:03:39,598 --> 01:03:43,471
But yeah, that's kinda
why I just do my thing,

1200
01:03:43,515 --> 01:03:46,344
'cause like, I dunno,
it's kinda fucked up still.

1201
01:03:46,387 --> 01:03:48,868
I'm still, it's all fucked up.

1202
01:03:48,912 --> 01:03:51,784
I ain't gonna say I ain't
got love for the man.

1203
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:53,917
You know, he helped me get my,
beat this case.

1204
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:55,744
You know, we filed for the
right shit and all that, man.

1205
01:03:55,788 --> 01:03:57,659
We out here, doing shit
and all that, so,

1206
01:03:57,703 --> 01:04:00,140
so I definitely still have love

1207
01:04:00,184 --> 01:04:01,750
and I still fucks with that
nigger for that shit.

1208
01:04:01,794 --> 01:04:02,969
No, that was a lot,
you know what I'm saying,

1209
01:04:03,013 --> 01:04:04,710
it was a long process.

1210
01:04:04,753 --> 01:04:06,755
The fact that he did that,
you know, means he's like,

1211
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:08,366
his heart is in the right
place and he want,

1212
01:04:08,409 --> 01:04:10,194
he wants to do good, but...

1213
01:04:13,414 --> 01:04:15,764
with the big picture,

1214
01:04:15,808 --> 01:04:17,897
we both standing on different
corners of the temple, so.

1215
01:04:20,334 --> 01:04:22,119
Don't mean we're enemies,
or nothin'.

1216
01:04:40,964 --> 01:04:43,923
Can someone call Josiah,
please? Dad?

1217
01:04:47,492 --> 01:04:49,537
Can you call? I can't call.
- Why?

1218
01:04:49,581 --> 01:04:51,365
- 'Cause I don't know.

1219
01:04:51,409 --> 01:04:53,367
- I don't think he's gonna
answer.

1220
01:04:53,411 --> 01:04:55,935
Dad, can you call Jos?

1221
01:04:55,979 --> 01:04:58,503
<i>Procession in
starts at 10.</i>

1222
01:04:58,546 --> 01:05:00,940
<i>And it's five after nine now.</i>

1223
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:04,770
So, we're all here now
just waiting on you.

1224
01:05:06,293 --> 01:05:07,860
Okay, okay.

1225
01:05:08,469 --> 01:05:10,602
A bientôt. Okay, bye.

1226
01:05:23,484 --> 01:05:25,051
Why is my whole
family spread out?

1227
01:05:25,095 --> 01:05:28,054
Tevan's right there,
Mariah's over there,

1228
01:05:28,098 --> 01:05:30,056
Liette's over there. Who knows
where everybody's at, man?

1229
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:32,667
<i>- Get someone to come talk
to you.</i>

1230
01:05:50,859 --> 01:05:53,862
- We're turning a page on some
of the dark chapters

1231
01:05:53,906 --> 01:05:55,038
in our people's history,

1232
01:05:57,910 --> 01:05:59,738
and we're coming together
here to celebrate

1233
01:05:59,781 --> 01:06:02,567
the opening of our new

1234
01:06:04,482 --> 01:06:06,397
Our people have been waiting
for this moment

1235
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:08,225
for a long, long time,

1236
01:06:09,748 --> 01:06:12,055
and it was the belief
of our Elders

1237
01:06:12,098 --> 01:06:14,231
that it was the missionaries
who intentionally destroyed

1238
01:06:14,274 --> 01:06:16,581
the last Big House

1239
01:06:16,624 --> 01:06:19,671
that stood here
in our community,

1240
01:06:19,714 --> 01:06:21,934
our territory.

1241
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:24,023
The churches that were here
at the time.

1242
01:06:25,764 --> 01:06:28,288
So, how ironic is it
that we're here on a Sunday

1243
01:06:28,332 --> 01:06:30,247
celebrating this again.

1244
01:07:45,017 --> 01:07:46,714
- Okay.

1245
01:08:07,257 --> 01:08:09,128
- Why did you ask me
to do your hair?

1246
01:08:09,172 --> 01:08:10,956
- Especially living here,
in Bella Bella,

1247
01:08:10,999 --> 01:08:13,219
like now that I just moved here,
I'm like okay,

1248
01:08:13,263 --> 01:08:15,352
there's no hair product
stuff here.

1249
01:08:15,395 --> 01:08:17,919
I'm like, like literally
the only Black people

1250
01:08:17,963 --> 01:08:20,444
in Bella Bella.

1251
01:08:22,576 --> 01:08:25,013
So, then like, who taught
you to, to do hair?

1252
01:08:25,057 --> 01:08:27,190
- Honestly, YouTube.

1253
01:08:27,233 --> 01:08:29,061
- Yeah.

1254
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:31,150
- YouTube, more than anything.
I'm not perfect at it.

1255
01:08:33,631 --> 01:08:35,589
<i>My Mom did my hair
a lot.</i>

1256
01:08:35,633 --> 01:08:38,418
<i>Um, my Dad would a lot
of ponytails, too.</i>

1257
01:08:38,462 --> 01:08:40,159
I guess growing up

1258
01:08:41,595 --> 01:08:44,032
we didn't really um,
like me,

1259
01:08:45,730 --> 01:08:48,385
I, I wasn't taught exactly like,

1260
01:08:48,428 --> 01:08:49,995
how to do like,
cornrows and things like that.

1261
01:08:51,692 --> 01:08:55,218
Um, but now I find that
I've been practicing

1262
01:08:55,261 --> 01:08:58,351
doing a few things,
so they're not super perfect,

1263
01:08:58,395 --> 01:09:00,658
but I've been, I've been
practicing because I'm like,

1264
01:09:00,701 --> 01:09:02,790
oh, when I have my own children,

1265
01:09:02,834 --> 01:09:05,315
I wanna try this,
and I would love to do that.

1266
01:09:05,358 --> 01:09:09,057
So, I kinda feel sometimes
like I've sorta missed out.

1267
01:09:09,101 --> 01:09:10,885
a little disappointed that
I'm like, oh, yeah,

1268
01:09:10,929 --> 01:09:12,365
I didn't get to learn to braid
hair, and all that,

1269
01:09:12,409 --> 01:09:14,280
at a young age,

1270
01:09:14,324 --> 01:09:17,196
or have that many people
teach me

1271
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:18,197
how to braid hair.

1272
01:09:20,025 --> 01:09:22,897
Um, but now I guess like,
it's better...

1273
01:09:22,941 --> 01:09:25,248
to do, late than never.

1274
01:09:25,291 --> 01:09:27,119
So, I'm learning,
little by little.

1275
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:29,643
Um, I'm so happy
that I moved here,

1276
01:09:29,687 --> 01:09:32,255
but I'm also like, ooh,
I hope I don't like lose,

1277
01:09:32,298 --> 01:09:34,518
like, lose my Black-ness
a little bit.

1278
01:09:34,561 --> 01:09:36,737
- Yeah?
- You know,

1279
01:09:36,781 --> 01:09:38,217
like I'm loving like,
the culture that I'm learning

1280
01:09:38,261 --> 01:09:40,350
and um,

1281
01:09:43,004 --> 01:09:45,485
and I do, I do take a lot
of pride into,

1282
01:09:46,530 --> 01:09:49,141
into my heritage and um,

1283
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:51,274
especially the Heiltsuk side.

1284
01:09:51,317 --> 01:09:53,450
It's amazing just to learn
a lot of,

1285
01:09:53,493 --> 01:09:55,843
a lot of things.
Like, especially this weekend,

1286
01:09:55,887 --> 01:09:57,454
like there's a lot of things
I didn't know.

1287
01:09:57,497 --> 01:10:00,283
Um, and it's kinda been,

1288
01:10:00,326 --> 01:10:02,285
but I feel like this weekend
also has kinda been

1289
01:10:02,328 --> 01:10:05,331
a bit of a emotional,
emotional rollercoaster;

1290
01:10:05,375 --> 01:10:06,767
a bit of a struggle, too,

1291
01:10:06,811 --> 01:10:08,595
like just being there
for Josiah.

1292
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:10,423
Um,

1293
01:10:10,467 --> 01:10:13,992
and also actually, even just
being there for my family.

1294
01:10:15,298 --> 01:10:17,909
And just knowing like,

1295
01:10:17,952 --> 01:10:19,954
the hardship that we actually
did face, and the stress,

1296
01:10:19,998 --> 01:10:22,130
and the negativity,
and all that.

1297
01:10:22,174 --> 01:10:24,176
I think my Grandpa
would be really proud,

1298
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:27,701
how my Dad really, really
fought for, for his family.

1299
01:10:30,182 --> 01:10:33,011
And to make sure that our
culture is not disrespected,

1300
01:10:35,143 --> 01:10:37,668
um, and that we really
uplift those that are,

1301
01:10:37,711 --> 01:10:39,887
that are our own.

1302
01:10:39,931 --> 01:10:43,108
- I noticed that Josiah
can be a little mean...

1303
01:10:43,151 --> 01:10:45,153
- Mm-hmm.
- towards you.

1304
01:10:45,197 --> 01:10:47,547
- I don't know, I think
it's 'cause since I've,

1305
01:10:49,419 --> 01:10:50,942
I think it's since, probably
since I've been dating girls,

1306
01:10:50,985 --> 01:10:53,292
probably is where he's--

1307
01:10:53,336 --> 01:10:55,555
Well, he kind of did the same
with my Dad, like,

1308
01:10:55,599 --> 01:10:57,731
it took him a long time
when my Dad came out,

1309
01:10:57,775 --> 01:11:00,168
and everything. It was like,
super hard on him

1310
01:11:00,212 --> 01:11:03,128
and it took a long time
to get where he is today,

1311
01:11:03,171 --> 01:11:06,218
where he can kinda be part
of like,

1312
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:08,176
when we have family dinners
and stuff.

1313
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:11,789
But like, he was really angry
for a while.

1314
01:11:11,832 --> 01:11:14,792
So, I'm assuming that's
probably the same thing.

1315
01:11:14,835 --> 01:11:17,490
They've really embraced,

1316
01:11:17,534 --> 01:11:20,319
you know, my identity
and everything, and they,

1317
01:11:20,363 --> 01:11:22,974
they just,

1318
01:11:23,017 --> 01:11:24,845
yeah, they didn't make it
a big deal.

1319
01:11:26,151 --> 01:11:29,023
So, yeah, that's,
that's kinda how I like it.

1320
01:11:29,067 --> 01:11:30,982
For sure.

1321
01:11:38,206 --> 01:11:39,556
- Thank you.

1322
01:11:44,038 --> 01:11:45,866
<i>I was more sad
than devastated,</i>

1323
01:11:45,910 --> 01:11:48,086
<i>when Mom and Dad, they both
sat us down and said</i>

1324
01:11:48,129 --> 01:11:50,958
<i>that they were, they were gonna
separate and then,</i>

1325
01:11:51,002 --> 01:11:53,613
<i>they were getting a divorce,
and that they couldn't,</i>

1326
01:11:53,657 --> 01:11:55,441
<i>they couldn't be together
anymore, and everything.</i>

1327
01:11:58,314 --> 01:12:00,011
- No, we have to take one
at a time, you guys.

1328
01:12:00,054 --> 01:12:01,795
- Aha!
- Okay. Ready?

1329
01:12:01,839 --> 01:12:03,797
We need Josiah here, too.

1330
01:12:03,841 --> 01:12:05,669
Tim's ears take up
half the thing.

1331
01:12:05,712 --> 01:12:08,236
-
- Okay, let's go.

1332
01:12:21,424 --> 01:12:23,164
- This is the crazy thing

1333
01:12:23,208 --> 01:12:25,297
when I don't get to come home
that often,

1334
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:28,039
and like even just remembering
landmarks.

1335
01:12:29,519 --> 01:12:32,870
Like, when I know that,
there's an opening in the trees,

1336
01:12:32,913 --> 01:12:35,307
you can sort of see this little

1337
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:37,396
pathway that goes in.

1338
01:12:40,094 --> 01:12:42,358
<i>All those years,
and everything, and having to,</i>

1339
01:12:42,401 --> 01:12:45,056
<i>having to pluck the courage
to, to tell his family.</i>

1340
01:12:47,406 --> 01:12:48,625
<i>Like, I know that was like,
super difficult for him,</i>

1341
01:12:48,668 --> 01:12:50,496
<i>for sure.</i>

1342
01:12:54,282 --> 01:12:57,024
<i>That was more sad
than you know, like,</i>

1343
01:12:57,068 --> 01:12:59,810
<i>my Dad saying that he was gay.</i>

1344
01:13:07,644 --> 01:13:09,646
I knew he was still my father
and everything,

1345
01:13:09,689 --> 01:13:12,605
and that my love for,
for him never changed.

1346
01:13:16,566 --> 01:13:18,655
- 1 and 46.
- Okay.

1347
01:13:18,698 --> 01:13:20,308
Wait. So if we see the number -
what happens?

1348
01:13:20,352 --> 01:13:21,832
- We're good.

1349
01:13:21,875 --> 01:13:23,442
- And if we don't see
the same number?

1350
01:13:33,147 --> 01:13:34,714
<i>- I'm still trying to wrap
my head around</i>

1351
01:13:34,758 --> 01:13:37,500
<i>why you don't wanna be,</i>

1352
01:13:37,543 --> 01:13:39,545
<i>why you didn't wanna go with
the, with the Grave Island,</i>

1353
01:13:39,589 --> 01:13:41,982
<i>just 'cause I know how you
felt about your Grandpa.</i>

1354
01:13:42,026 --> 01:13:43,897
and how close you two were.
- Mm-hmm.

1355
01:13:43,941 --> 01:13:47,335
- Yeah.
- I dunno.

1356
01:13:47,379 --> 01:13:50,338
I have no, I don't really
have a reason for it

1357
01:13:50,382 --> 01:13:52,210
other than I didn't wanna go.

1358
01:13:54,691 --> 01:13:57,433
That's mainly it.

1359
01:13:57,476 --> 01:13:59,304
<i>- Are you gonna try to go
by yourself, or what?</i>

1360
01:13:59,347 --> 01:14:00,871
- I dunno, we'll see.

1361
01:14:03,569 --> 01:14:05,441
There's definitely a reason
to but not with them.

1362
01:14:05,484 --> 01:14:07,138
I dunno.

1363
01:14:09,619 --> 01:14:12,099
My Grandpa and I used
to fuck around all the time.

1364
01:14:12,143 --> 01:14:14,406
We would, we were always
just joking,

1365
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:16,582
and always getting ourselves
into some kinda trouble.

1366
01:14:18,628 --> 01:14:21,108
What, no matter what sorta
stuff it was,

1367
01:14:21,152 --> 01:14:22,675
it was always something.

1368
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:25,330
But my uh, I dunno,

1369
01:14:27,593 --> 01:14:30,335
I honour him like, every day.
I pray to this guy.

1370
01:14:30,378 --> 01:14:33,556
I dunno. I have multiple
pictures in my,

1371
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:37,342
just stuff of his in my room
in my house, so I dunno,

1372
01:14:37,385 --> 01:14:40,606
I don't really have, yeah.

1373
01:14:40,650 --> 01:14:43,348
And like, I don't
like graveyards, yo.

1374
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:58,450
Is it good, Papa?
- Yep, really good.

1375
01:15:00,147 --> 01:15:02,193
Yeah. We're doing
things together.

1376
01:15:02,236 --> 01:15:04,935
Ohhh.
That's very nice.

1377
01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:15,598
Josiah, ou sommes-nous,
maintenant?

1378
01:15:15,641 --> 01:15:18,252
- A Bella Bella!

1379
01:15:18,296 --> 01:15:20,472
What about Papa,
any famous last words?

1380
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:23,214
- Yes, I'd like to say
that I'm very happy

1381
01:15:23,257 --> 01:15:25,477
that my Grandkids are here,

1382
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:28,088
and Christmas and the New Year.

1383
01:15:30,308 --> 01:15:32,484
- I'm just happy to be here
with our family

1384
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:36,444
and I'm looking forward to all
that God has in store for us

1385
01:15:36,488 --> 01:15:38,577
in the next,
in the year 2000 and beyond.

1386
01:15:40,013 --> 01:15:42,755
Happy New Year!

1387
01:15:42,799 --> 01:15:44,931
Cheers! Cheers!

1388
01:15:44,975 --> 01:15:47,586
- Cheers! Cheers!
- Cheers!

1389
01:15:54,811 --> 01:15:57,378
- I hadn't been to see my Dad's
grave for quite a while,

1390
01:15:57,422 --> 01:15:59,598
so that was really meaningful.

1391
01:15:59,642 --> 01:16:02,427
And the fact that I had
my four kids with me, um,

1392
01:16:03,907 --> 01:16:06,083
that is uh, a rare event.

1393
01:16:07,650 --> 01:16:10,348
I was telling my kids
about my Dad's sense of humour,

1394
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:13,525
and he always used to say
this phrase

1395
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:15,832
about in the future,

1396
01:16:15,875 --> 01:16:18,443
he goes, "When I'm in the
graveyard pushing up daisies..."

1397
01:16:18,486 --> 01:16:20,401
and I'm like, I said,

1398
01:16:20,445 --> 01:16:22,055
we need to bring some
daisies over here

1399
01:16:22,099 --> 01:16:24,449
and plant them around his grave.

1400
01:16:24,492 --> 01:16:27,844
But they actually take over,
so we might not do that,

1401
01:16:27,887 --> 01:16:30,324
But...

1402
01:16:30,368 --> 01:16:32,065
kinda lightened the mood
a little bit

1403
01:16:32,109 --> 01:16:34,067
and talked about his,
his humour

1404
01:16:34,111 --> 01:16:36,504
about when he would talk
about when he was gone.

1405
01:16:36,548 --> 01:16:38,637
So, and of course,

1406
01:16:38,681 --> 01:16:41,814
the kids knew him very well
and remembered his humour,

1407
01:16:41,858 --> 01:16:44,295
so we got just to share
some memories, yeah.

1408
01:16:45,775 --> 01:16:48,081
<i>- Um, Jos was supposed to come.</i>

1409
01:16:48,125 --> 01:16:49,953
- Um, he just,
he decided not to.

1410
01:16:51,694 --> 01:16:54,479
So, you know, we,
we let him process things

1411
01:16:54,522 --> 01:16:56,655
how he processes them.

1412
01:16:56,699 --> 01:16:59,658
He's, he tries to be such
a tough guy.

1413
01:17:01,921 --> 01:17:03,880
And he, and in a way,
in a lot of ways, he is.

1414
01:17:03,923 --> 01:17:05,708
He's been through a lot in,
in his life.

1415
01:17:05,751 --> 01:17:09,407
But um, he's also a very
sensitive human being,

1416
01:17:09,450 --> 01:17:11,670
and so, sometimes
it's just too much.

1417
01:17:13,106 --> 01:17:15,065
And he and my Dad
were particularly close.

1418
01:17:15,108 --> 01:17:17,110
So, for him to go

1419
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:21,114
and sort of relive that,

1420
01:17:22,725 --> 01:17:25,771
and have all of those emotions
brought up again,

1421
01:17:25,815 --> 01:17:28,121
I guess he just wasn't
in the space to do it.

1422
01:17:28,165 --> 01:17:30,558
So, that, that's okay.

1423
01:17:30,602 --> 01:17:32,909
Um, he'll have other
opportunities, so.

1424
01:17:32,952 --> 01:17:34,693
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1425
01:17:48,185 --> 01:17:50,317
The whole purpose
of this washing ceremony

1426
01:17:50,361 --> 01:17:53,538
is to mark a moment in time,

1427
01:17:53,581 --> 01:17:55,496
and what we are doing
as your family

1428
01:17:55,540 --> 01:17:58,543
and as your community
is standing um,

1429
01:17:58,586 --> 01:18:00,371
with you.
- Mm-hmm.

1430
01:18:00,414 --> 01:18:02,373
- Is to make a statement

1431
01:18:02,416 --> 01:18:04,244
so that you have this moment
in time

1432
01:18:04,288 --> 01:18:06,812
that you can think back to,

1433
01:18:06,856 --> 01:18:09,554
and you will remember that
from that moment forward,

1434
01:18:09,597 --> 01:18:11,817
you don't have to hold on
to any of that stuff.

1435
01:18:11,861 --> 01:18:14,124
- Mm-hmm.
- Any of it.
- Okay.

1436
01:18:15,995 --> 01:18:17,780
- Just keep in mind,
a lot of the reasons

1437
01:18:17,823 --> 01:18:20,957
why people are so good to us
is because of your Papa.

1438
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,350
- Mm-hmm.

1439
01:18:23,394 --> 01:18:26,527
- And how much they really
esteemed him

1440
01:18:28,051 --> 01:18:29,748
and they love that they had
for your Papa,

1441
01:18:32,011 --> 01:18:34,492
they're now, that's what they
hold for you, now.

1442
01:18:35,841 --> 01:18:37,974
So, don't forget.
- Yep.

1443
01:18:38,017 --> 01:18:39,758
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

1444
01:18:39,802 --> 01:18:41,760
- So, this is how important
it is.

1445
01:18:41,804 --> 01:18:44,981
And why this washing ceremony
means so much to me,

1446
01:18:45,024 --> 01:18:46,765
that they're gonna do this
for you.

1447
01:18:46,809 --> 01:18:48,636
- Okay.
- Okay?

1448
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:52,684
So... do you have any,
do you have any questions?

1449
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:54,817
- I ain't, I ain't talking
though, that's it.

1450
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:56,427
- No, you don't have to.

1451
01:18:56,470 --> 01:18:58,255
- That's it.
That's, I'm out of here.

1452
01:19:11,703 --> 01:19:13,400
- I'm just tired.

1453
01:19:13,444 --> 01:19:15,620
I don't even wanna be here
anymore, like this is--

1454
01:19:34,595 --> 01:19:36,641
Today, we want
to thank the Hemas

1455
01:19:36,684 --> 01:19:38,948
and the Tribal Council,

1456
01:19:38,991 --> 01:19:41,211
for giving us the opportunity
to uplift Josiah today

1457
01:19:41,254 --> 01:19:43,343
in our Great House.

1458
01:19:43,387 --> 01:19:46,782
Josiah is of Haitian ancestry
by birth

1459
01:19:46,825 --> 01:19:49,741
and was adopted by my brother,
Don, and his wife, Liette,

1460
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:51,308
when he was months old,

1461
01:19:51,351 --> 01:19:53,310
when they were living in Haiti.

1462
01:19:53,353 --> 01:19:55,834
In 2015,
Josiah received a letter

1463
01:19:57,314 --> 01:19:59,272
that banned him
from participating

1464
01:19:59,316 --> 01:20:01,666
in the tournament
to a blood quantum rule.

1465
01:20:01,709 --> 01:20:05,496
This was devastating to Josiah,
and in turn,

1466
01:20:05,539 --> 01:20:07,759
to our family
and our Nation as a whole.

1467
01:20:09,413 --> 01:20:11,850
Blood quantum was a policy
enacted by the government

1468
01:20:11,894 --> 01:20:14,461
to eventually abolish us
as Indigenous people.

1469
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:17,595
So, as we began to figure out

1470
01:20:17,638 --> 01:20:19,684
how we could challenge
this further,

1471
01:20:19,727 --> 01:20:22,556
we decided that this
was about a human right.

1472
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,732
This was about
our Heiltsuk right,

1473
01:20:24,776 --> 01:20:26,822
our Indigenous rights
as people.

1474
01:20:26,865 --> 01:20:29,563
In the end, we ended up
settling the matter;

1475
01:20:29,607 --> 01:20:32,088
that rule was taken away,

1476
01:20:32,131 --> 01:20:34,568
it no longer exists within
the All Native committee.

1477
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:45,536
Your story has helped
others who have been adopted

1478
01:20:45,579 --> 01:20:47,625
and to have brought
into their place,

1479
01:20:47,668 --> 01:20:50,193
to be reaffirmed that
you are one of ours.

1480
01:20:50,236 --> 01:20:52,717
That's never been
a question for us,

1481
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:54,893
and we want you
to recognize that today

1482
01:20:54,937 --> 01:20:56,068
and really sink that.

1483
01:20:57,504 --> 01:20:59,202
- My Son was born

1484
01:20:59,245 --> 01:21:01,117
in a rural hospital in Haiti

1485
01:21:04,685 --> 01:21:07,427
and he was orphaned
at age four days.

1486
01:21:11,431 --> 01:21:12,955
When he was two weeks old,

1487
01:21:12,998 --> 01:21:16,219
I got him discharged
into the care of a lady,

1488
01:21:16,262 --> 01:21:18,569
an American lady
that was living there.

1489
01:21:18,612 --> 01:21:20,919
Never thinking

1490
01:21:20,963 --> 01:21:22,921
that I was gonna have anything
more to do with it.

1491
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,794
And when Josiah
was two months old,

1492
01:21:28,187 --> 01:21:31,364
my Mother and Father came
from home

1493
01:21:31,408 --> 01:21:33,149
to visit us down there.

1494
01:21:33,192 --> 01:21:35,194
And we have a photo

1495
01:21:36,761 --> 01:21:38,850
of my father holding Josiah

1496
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:41,548
when he was a two-month-old
infant,

1497
01:21:41,592 --> 01:21:43,202
and he didn't know at that time

1498
01:21:43,246 --> 01:21:45,596
that this was his future
Grandson

1499
01:21:46,684 --> 01:21:48,991
until a few months later,

1500
01:21:49,034 --> 01:21:50,818
we told him

1501
01:21:50,862 --> 01:21:53,212
that we were gonna move ahead
with an adoption

1502
01:21:56,172 --> 01:21:58,565
of that little baby.

1503
01:21:59,827 --> 01:22:02,395
And he said,

1504
01:22:02,439 --> 01:22:04,484
"I just knew

1505
01:22:04,528 --> 01:22:06,051
that was my Grandson
that I was holding,"

1506
01:22:09,228 --> 01:22:12,840
and it seems like
from that moment onwards,

1507
01:22:12,884 --> 01:22:15,495
the two of them had such a bond.

1508
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:21,066
<i>And for me,
this whole story</i>

1509
01:22:21,110 --> 01:22:22,285
<i>of what he has been through,</i>

1510
01:22:24,852 --> 01:22:28,900
<i>it just shines a light on
our right as Heiltsuk</i>

1511
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:32,034
<i>to exercise our sovereignty</i>

1512
01:22:32,077 --> 01:22:34,036
<i>to decide who is one of us.</i>

1513
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:37,517
<i>Just like any nation
has the right to do that,</i>

1514
01:22:37,561 --> 01:22:39,563
<i>we have the right to do that.</i>

1515
01:23:05,284 --> 01:23:07,330
- Thank you.

1516
01:23:07,373 --> 01:23:09,419
See what they're doing for you?

1517
01:24:48,605 --> 01:24:50,302
<i>Healing is um,</i>

1518
01:24:50,346 --> 01:24:53,262
<i>a necessary process
of any kind of damage</i>

1519
01:24:53,305 --> 01:24:55,438
<i>done to anybody.</i>

1520
01:24:56,830 --> 01:24:58,745
<i>You just can't rush it.</i>

1521
01:24:58,789 --> 01:25:00,356
<i>Everybody heals
at a different pace.</i>

1522
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:06,797
<i>My family, I guess they
would've thought that</i>

1523
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:09,060
<i>the washing ceremony</i>

1524
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:11,845
<i>would help with trauma
and everything,</i>

1525
01:25:11,889 --> 01:25:14,370
<i>and it was really nice,</i>

1526
01:25:14,413 --> 01:25:17,764
<i>and it was really good,
and I appreciate it a lot.</i>

1527
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:23,161
<i>When that happened,
we just took another turn.</i>

1528
01:25:25,294 --> 01:25:27,339
He was like, "I got you."

1529
01:25:28,645 --> 01:25:30,473
<i>If it wasn't for him,</i>

1530
01:25:30,516 --> 01:25:31,735
<i>I probably wouldn't be here
right now, honestly.</i>

1531
01:25:36,696 --> 01:25:38,742
<i>You know, I definitely just,
I appreciate him for that.</i>

1532
01:25:52,103 --> 01:25:53,583
<i>Even though, yeah,
okay, I was mad,</i>

1533
01:25:53,626 --> 01:25:54,627
or like yeah, we didn't,
we hadn't talked,

1534
01:25:54,671 --> 01:25:57,326
and all that kind of stuff,

1535
01:25:57,369 --> 01:26:00,807
like, we still on good terms.
Like, I still got love.

1536
01:26:00,851 --> 01:26:04,898
It's like, it's just life tings,
I guess.

1537
01:26:11,470 --> 01:26:13,255
<i>It's gonna take time.
Like, it's not something</i>

1538
01:26:13,298 --> 01:26:16,475
<i>that I'm gonna forget about
and just move on about</i>

1539
01:26:16,519 --> 01:26:19,130
<i>within the next couple days,
or whatever.</i>

1540
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:21,437
<i>I'm gonna still think
about this for a long time.</i>

1541
01:26:29,271 --> 01:26:31,316
<i>Whatever it is, you just gotta
let that person heal</i>

1542
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:32,796
<i>at their pace
and just let them do them.</i>

1543
01:27:43,780 --> 01:27:46,130
Though Josiah's story is unique,
it represents

1544
01:27:46,173 --> 01:27:47,871
the many layers
to our identities

1545
01:27:47,914 --> 01:27:49,960
and where we belong
in the world.

1546
01:27:50,003 --> 01:27:51,527
Joining me now
to talk about "One of Ours"

1547
01:27:51,570 --> 01:27:53,093
are former
Canadian basketball player

1548
01:27:53,137 --> 01:27:56,183
and First Nation councilman
Michael Linklater

1549
01:27:56,227 --> 01:27:58,229
and US Representative
Sharice Davids.

1550
01:27:58,273 --> 01:28:01,014
Hi, yeah, thanks for having me.
I'm so happy to be here.

1551
01:28:01,058 --> 01:28:03,147
What were both of your thoughts
and/or takeaways

1552
01:28:03,190 --> 01:28:04,627
upon watching the film?

1553
01:28:04,670 --> 01:28:06,237
I appreciated
that we had to

1554
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:08,587
not just explore
ideas of identity

1555
01:28:08,631 --> 01:28:10,415
but also explore

1556
01:28:10,459 --> 01:28:13,026
the concept
of healing from trauma.

1557
01:28:13,070 --> 01:28:15,202
I was very, very,
uh, touched

1558
01:28:15,246 --> 01:28:17,857
by the heavy topics
that were brought up,

1559
01:28:17,901 --> 01:28:21,426
but also the beauty
in things like ceremony

1560
01:28:21,470 --> 01:28:24,821
and communities coming together
to support each other.

1561
01:28:24,864 --> 01:28:26,953
Yes,
coping and healing.

1562
01:28:26,997 --> 01:28:28,607
Uh, Michael,
what were your thoughts?

1563
01:28:28,651 --> 01:28:31,001
I really
felt for Josiah,

1564
01:28:31,044 --> 01:28:33,003
his journey,
the struggles,

1565
01:28:33,046 --> 01:28:35,092
the adversity
that he had to face.

1566
01:28:35,135 --> 01:28:36,789
You can really
empathize with him

1567
01:28:36,833 --> 01:28:39,183
and where he's coming from
and what he's gone through,

1568
01:28:39,226 --> 01:28:41,185
but I think
one of the most important things

1569
01:28:41,228 --> 01:28:44,623
that I would like
to kind of shine some light on

1570
01:28:44,667 --> 01:28:46,277
is the fact that,
you know,

1571
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:48,671
they're indigenous
to a different place.

1572
01:28:48,714 --> 01:28:51,761
Let's just take, you know,
a non-indigenous family

1573
01:28:51,804 --> 01:28:53,980
adopting somebody
who is indigenous.

1574
01:28:54,024 --> 01:28:56,200
I think
it's really important

1575
01:28:56,243 --> 01:28:59,421
that you have your --
your family structure

1576
01:28:59,464 --> 01:29:01,423
and the culture
of your family,

1577
01:29:01,466 --> 01:29:05,688
but it's really important
to honor where you come from.

1578
01:29:05,731 --> 01:29:08,865
Josiah was not confused
about who he was

1579
01:29:08,908 --> 01:29:12,434
and where his place was
within the Heiltsuk community

1580
01:29:12,477 --> 01:29:14,174
until he was told
he was different,

1581
01:29:14,218 --> 01:29:16,699
and how does
our view of ourselves change

1582
01:29:16,742 --> 01:29:17,961
with outside influence?

1583
01:29:18,004 --> 01:29:19,310
A-And should it?

1584
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:20,964
I have thought
a lot about

1585
01:29:21,007 --> 01:29:23,923
what it means
to be native.

1586
01:29:23,967 --> 01:29:26,186
You know,
I am -- I am Ho-Chunk,

1587
01:29:26,230 --> 01:29:29,233
which is
a tribe in Wisconsin.

1588
01:29:29,276 --> 01:29:31,235
The thing
that struck me the most

1589
01:29:31,278 --> 01:29:35,152
was it wasn't just Josiah
that -- that felt really solid

1590
01:29:35,195 --> 01:29:39,112
in his, uh, place in --
in his community.

1591
01:29:39,156 --> 01:29:42,028
It was the leaders
of his community.

1592
01:29:42,072 --> 01:29:45,292
It was the other tribal,
uh, members.

1593
01:29:45,336 --> 01:29:48,339
It was the folks
on the basketball team.

1594
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:50,950
Even when it comes to,
um, you know,

1595
01:29:50,994 --> 01:29:52,996
other, like,
external factors

1596
01:29:53,039 --> 01:29:54,737
or making reference to,

1597
01:29:54,780 --> 01:29:56,347
let's just say,
basketball teams,

1598
01:29:56,391 --> 01:29:58,697
you decide who becomes
a part of your team,

1599
01:29:58,741 --> 01:30:00,177
and that's your team.

1600
01:30:00,220 --> 01:30:02,658
Uh, and it's the same thing
for nations.

1601
01:30:02,701 --> 01:30:05,965
Nations who --
who have that sovereignty

1602
01:30:06,009 --> 01:30:08,185
over themselves
as First Peoples,

1603
01:30:08,228 --> 01:30:09,665
they're the ones
that decide that.

1604
01:30:09,708 --> 01:30:11,275
The blood quantum --

1605
01:30:11,318 --> 01:30:12,929
you know,
that's a colonial construct.

1606
01:30:12,972 --> 01:30:16,715
It was a construct
designed to eradicate us

1607
01:30:16,759 --> 01:30:19,718
in hopes that
we would eventually fall off,

1608
01:30:19,762 --> 01:30:22,329
where there is
no blood quantum

1609
01:30:22,373 --> 01:30:25,332
for us
to identify as who we are.

1610
01:30:25,376 --> 01:30:27,552
My great-great-grandmother
was Choctaw,

1611
01:30:27,596 --> 01:30:30,163
and so --
my great-great-grandmother Ari.

1612
01:30:30,207 --> 01:30:31,730
I remember
always being discouraged

1613
01:30:31,774 --> 01:30:33,515
from following up
on that

1614
01:30:33,558 --> 01:30:36,082
because, like, "Well,
you can't go to a reservation

1615
01:30:36,126 --> 01:30:38,345
because you have to prove
this amount of, you know,

1616
01:30:38,389 --> 01:30:41,087
'blood,'" so to speak,
which -- which comes up a lot,

1617
01:30:41,131 --> 01:30:44,482
which I didn't even recognize
as a huge, you know,

1618
01:30:44,526 --> 01:30:47,920
colonialist kind of,
like, stigma, you know?

1619
01:30:47,964 --> 01:30:51,010
When you look at different
religions or different beliefs,

1620
01:30:51,054 --> 01:30:53,491
you don't necessarily
have to, like,

1621
01:30:53,535 --> 01:30:57,582
come from where that religion
or belief was founded

1622
01:30:57,626 --> 01:31:00,803
in order to practice
that way of life.

1623
01:31:00,846 --> 01:31:03,022
Even Josiah's white siblings
struggle with identity

1624
01:31:03,066 --> 01:31:05,329
because they don't
"look" indigenous.

1625
01:31:05,372 --> 01:31:07,723
Is too much importance
placed on appearance

1626
01:31:07,766 --> 01:31:11,727
as a part of identity
and belonging in our society?

1627
01:31:11,770 --> 01:31:15,513
There are a lot of,
uh, constructs around

1628
01:31:15,557 --> 01:31:19,778
who should be considered
native or indigenous

1629
01:31:19,822 --> 01:31:22,520
here in North America,

1630
01:31:22,564 --> 01:31:24,304
and this story
is a great example

1631
01:31:24,348 --> 01:31:27,612
of having to deal with
issues of identity.

1632
01:31:27,656 --> 01:31:31,834
What is the modern Native
experience in North America?

1633
01:31:31,877 --> 01:31:33,531
We just don't get to see that
that often.

1634
01:31:33,575 --> 01:31:34,967
Truly, truly.

1635
01:31:35,011 --> 01:31:36,839
What are your thoughts
on representation

1636
01:31:36,882 --> 01:31:39,537
of indigenous people in media,
as well as people like Josiah,

1637
01:31:39,581 --> 01:31:42,540
whose identities
are less identifiable?

1638
01:31:42,584 --> 01:31:48,154
The only time you see
indigenous people in the media,

1639
01:31:48,198 --> 01:31:53,029
majority of the time,
it's for negative things.

1640
01:31:53,072 --> 01:31:55,205
You rarely see
the positive things,

1641
01:31:55,248 --> 01:31:57,250
and there are so many
wonderful things

1642
01:31:57,294 --> 01:31:58,817
that indigenous people do.

1643
01:31:58,861 --> 01:32:00,602
It speaks
to the misrepresentation

1644
01:32:00,645 --> 01:32:03,996
and the under-representation
of minorities.

1645
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:06,085
I do think
that we're in a time

1646
01:32:06,129 --> 01:32:11,569
of racial reckoning and also
a historical acknowledgement

1647
01:32:11,613 --> 01:32:14,790
of how our country
got to the place

1648
01:32:14,833 --> 01:32:16,618
that we are in now.

1649
01:32:16,661 --> 01:32:18,402
The film shines a spotlight

1650
01:32:18,445 --> 01:32:21,231
on the themes of identity
and belonging.

1651
01:32:21,274 --> 01:32:24,060
How do you personally
define identity?

1652
01:32:24,103 --> 01:32:27,759
It's a lifetime journey
full of twists and turns

1653
01:32:27,803 --> 01:32:31,676
and one that is shaped
by your -- your circumstances.

1654
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:35,419
I have certainly, um,
become more solid

1655
01:32:35,462 --> 01:32:39,205
in -- in who I am
in a number of different ways

1656
01:32:39,249 --> 01:32:42,208
since, uh,
since getting into Congress.

1657
01:32:42,252 --> 01:32:43,601
I have learned a lot.

1658
01:32:43,645 --> 01:32:45,647
I have seen
a lot of things

1659
01:32:45,690 --> 01:32:48,693
that I never would've seen
if I weren't in this position.

1660
01:32:48,737 --> 01:32:51,870
You know, there's constant
changes within your identity,

1661
01:32:51,914 --> 01:32:53,611
and as you grow,

1662
01:32:53,655 --> 01:32:55,787
and I think even
looking at Josiah's father,

1663
01:32:55,831 --> 01:32:58,094
you know,
he didn't identify

1664
01:32:58,137 --> 01:33:00,705
or even really recognize
he was gay

1665
01:33:00,749 --> 01:33:02,620
'til a long time
throughout his life.

1666
01:33:02,664 --> 01:33:05,362
I think that identity
is constantly searching

1667
01:33:05,405 --> 01:33:07,146
in where you belong
and where you fit

1668
01:33:07,190 --> 01:33:09,148
or where you feel
most comfortable

1669
01:33:09,192 --> 01:33:12,325
is where you'll --
you'll identify.

1670
01:33:12,369 --> 01:33:15,459
Michael, Representative Davids,
thanks for digging into the --

1671
01:33:15,502 --> 01:33:17,417
the intersectionalities
of identity.

1672
01:33:17,461 --> 01:33:19,942
It's been a pleasure
having you both.

1673
01:33:19,985 --> 01:33:21,813
Thank you so much
for having me today.

1674
01:33:21,857 --> 01:33:23,510
Thanks so much
for inviting me to this.

1675
01:33:23,554 --> 01:33:25,034
This was such
a great conversation.

1676
01:33:25,077 --> 01:33:27,079
Films like "One of Ours,"

1677
01:33:27,123 --> 01:33:29,952
which force us to challenge
the way we perceive each other,

1678
01:33:29,995 --> 01:33:33,042
are the exact kind of stories
we need to see more of.

1679
01:33:33,085 --> 01:33:34,870
Thanks so much for watching
"Can We Talk About This?"

1680
01:33:34,913 --> 01:33:36,915
Join me next time
for another compelling film

1681
01:33:36,959 --> 01:33:38,177
and riveting convo.

1682
01:33:38,221 --> 01:33:40,310
I'm Jordan Carlos.
Goodbye for now.
