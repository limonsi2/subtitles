5
00:01:07,141 --> 00:01:09,445
(man) Hey, that's a great idea.

00:01:12,084 --> 00:01:15,424

Whoo!

11
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:35,899
We have a third-alarm call
from the Clock Tower!

12
00:01:35,999 --> 00:01:38,671
There are people
trapped on the top floor!

13
00:01:38,771 --> 00:01:39,873
(barks)

14
00:01:39,973 --> 00:01:41,109
I'm not Georgia.

15
00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:43,413
I'm Captain Georgia!

16
00:01:45,184 --> 00:01:47,188
(gasps) It looks like a bad one!

17
00:01:47,288 --> 00:01:49,927
Hurry, Probie!
We have people to save!

18
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:52,264
(gasps) Look out!

19
00:01:53,367 --> 00:01:54,837

20
00:01:54,937 --> 00:01:56,640

- (gasps)
- (train bell rings)

23
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:06,827
Ember, stretch a line,

24
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:09,065
hook up to the hydrant
and extend the ladder.

25
00:02:09,165 --> 00:02:12,304
I've got to get
to the top floor.

26
00:02:12,405 --> 00:02:15,177
(both screaming)

27
00:02:20,522 --> 00:02:22,191
Whoa!

28
00:02:25,364 --> 00:02:27,268

- Aaah!
- No...!

36
00:02:54,322 --> 00:02:56,159
<i>(Georgia) You see</i>
<i>that amazing girl?</i>

37
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,163
<i>Well, it's me, Georgia Nolan.</i>

38
00:02:58,263 --> 00:03:01,002
<i>And this is my faithful dog,</i>
<i>Ember Nolan.</i>

39
00:03:01,102 --> 00:03:02,506
<i>She's sweet, right?</i>

40
00:03:02,606 --> 00:03:05,210
<i>Oh, and by the way,</i>
<i>the man freaking out</i>

41
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,181
<i>is my dad, Captain Shawn Nolan.</i>

42
00:03:07,281 --> 00:03:09,318
<i>Let me tell you about him.</i>

43
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:13,059
<i>Captain Shawn Nolan</i>

44
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,164
<i>was the best</i>
<i>and bravest fireman</i>

45
00:03:15,264 --> 00:03:18,003
<i>in the whole wide world</i>
<i>of New York.</i>

46
00:03:18,538 --> 00:03:20,107
(gasps)

47
00:03:20,207 --> 00:03:22,244
<i>He saved so many lives.</i>

48
00:03:22,344 --> 00:03:24,783
- He was a legend!
- (all) Yeah!

49
00:03:24,883 --> 00:03:27,722
<i>(Georgia) But he couldn't save</i>
<i>my mom when she had a baby...</i>

50
00:03:27,823 --> 00:03:29,560
<i>who was me.</i>

51
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,198
<i>At first he tried to be</i>
<i>a fireman and a dad</i>

52
00:03:32,298 --> 00:03:33,601
<i>at the same time.</i>

53
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:35,672
Oh! No! No, no, no, no!

54
00:03:35,772 --> 00:03:37,609
<i>That was very difficult.</i>

55
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:39,178
- (sighs)
- (giggles)

56
00:03:39,278 --> 00:03:43,453
<i>So he became a tailor instead,</i>
<i>like his dad.</i>

57
00:03:43,554 --> 00:03:48,463
<i>He said he didn't mind because</i>
<i>he loves me so, so, so much.</i>

58
00:03:48,564 --> 00:03:51,604
<i>Along with Ember, we have</i>
<i>a super great life together.</i>

59
00:03:51,704 --> 00:03:55,310
<i>And now I'm training to be</i>
<i>a fireman and save lives</i>

60
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:59,987
<i>just like my hero</i>
<i>Captain Shawn Nolan used to do.</i>

61
00:04:00,087 --> 00:04:04,061
<i>It's my dream. It's my destiny!</i>

62
00:04:04,162 --> 00:04:06,065
- Oh!
- (clanging)

63
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,069
Emergency
at the chemical factory!

64
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,942
- Georgia, no!
- (crashing)

65
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,679
Emergency!
Fire on the zip line!

66
00:04:12,779 --> 00:04:14,516
- Georgia, no!
- Whoa!

67
00:04:14,616 --> 00:04:16,252
- Whoa!
- (smashing)

68
00:04:16,352 --> 00:04:17,656
Emergency on Brooklyn Bridge!

69
00:04:17,756 --> 00:04:20,060
- But I got it...
- No, Georgia, no!

70
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,566
- ...under control!
- No!

71
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,670
(whimpers)

72
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,676
(soft music)

73
00:04:27,776 --> 00:04:30,180
- The doctor says it's nothing.
- Stop with that!

74
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,384
- (Ember) Oh?
- You could've broken your neck.

75
00:04:32,484 --> 00:04:34,088
But Ember was the fire truck.

76
00:04:34,188 --> 00:04:37,394
- And we had to go save people!
- Georgia, enough!

77
00:04:37,494 --> 00:04:40,367
No more rescues inside the house
or on the street,

78
00:04:40,467 --> 00:04:43,006
or at the bottom of the sea,
or on top of a mountain,

79
00:04:43,106 --> 00:04:45,310
in the jungle, in the desert,
or on the moon.

80
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,951
Dad, there can't be a fire
on the moon. There's no oxygen.

81
00:04:49,051 --> 00:04:51,289
I know that.
(breathing hard)

82
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:55,531
Listen to me. No more
fireman games anywhere at all.

83
00:04:55,632 --> 00:04:58,036
But I have to train
to be a fireman

84
00:04:58,136 --> 00:05:00,340
if I want to save lots of people
just like you.

85
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,013
Georgia, I'm a tailor now.

86
00:05:03,113 --> 00:05:05,585
I don't save people from fires.

87
00:05:05,685 --> 00:05:08,724
I save them
from holes in their pants.

88
00:05:08,824 --> 00:05:11,664
Do you think
I would be a good fireman?

89
00:05:11,764 --> 00:05:14,235
Yes, you'd be a great fireman.

90
00:05:14,335 --> 00:05:16,372
You have the heart for it,
but... (sighs)

91
00:05:16,472 --> 00:05:20,582
In that case, no one
can stop me. Not even you.

92
00:05:22,151 --> 00:05:23,286
(Ember whimpers)

93
00:05:23,386 --> 00:05:25,725
I have to tell her, Ember.
(sighs)

94
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,831
The longer we wait,
the worse it will be.

95
00:05:31,637 --> 00:05:33,073
(sighs)

96
00:05:36,246 --> 00:05:37,816
Nice hat.

97
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,487
I may need to borrow it
for the spaghetti later, though.

98
00:05:40,588 --> 00:05:43,661
Or else there'd be
a meatball emergency.

99
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:46,165
Yeah. (chuckles) Funny.

100
00:05:46,967 --> 00:05:49,640
Georgia...

101
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,750
Do you know why we say fireman
and not firewoman?

102
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,520
To save time?

103
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,524
No, Peanut.

104
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:01,129
Because girls aren't allowed
to be firemen.

105
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:04,603
- It's against the rules.
- Why?

106
00:06:04,703 --> 00:06:08,076
Well, people don't think
girls are strong enough

107
00:06:08,176 --> 00:06:09,713
for such a dangerous job.

108
00:06:09,813 --> 00:06:13,219
But I'm training
so I get really strong.

109
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,790
And I'm brave.

110
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,459
As brave as any boy.

111
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,929
You know I am.

112
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:21,937
I do know. There's no one
who deserves it more.

113
00:06:22,037 --> 00:06:25,243
But I'm afraid
those are the rules.

114
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:28,483
- Will the rules change?
- I hope they will.

115
00:06:28,584 --> 00:06:31,055
But these things
can take a long time.

116
00:06:31,155 --> 00:06:32,525
And I wouldn't want you
waiting around

117
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,596
for something
that might never happen.

118
00:06:34,696 --> 00:06:38,971
But you can be a seamstress
and work with me!

119
00:06:39,071 --> 00:06:41,476
Is the sewing machine on fire?

120
00:06:41,577 --> 00:06:42,846
No.

121
00:06:42,946 --> 00:06:44,415
In that case, no, thank you.

122
00:06:44,516 --> 00:06:46,520
Georgia, I don't how else
to say this:

123
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,524
you will never be a fireman!

124
00:06:48,624 --> 00:06:50,427
(soft gasp)

125
00:06:50,528 --> 00:06:53,901
- Oh, I'm sorry, Peanut.
- (sighs)

126
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:57,509
I know it's unfair.

127
00:06:59,345 --> 00:07:01,684
(whimpers)

128
00:07:09,498 --> 00:07:10,935
(sighs)

129
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:15,545
(sighs)

130
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:20,220
(soft music)

131
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,792
(Ember whimpers)

132
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:28,470
(Shawn sighs)

133
00:07:28,571 --> 00:07:30,207
I know.

134
00:07:30,307 --> 00:07:33,614
One day I'll have to tell her
the whole story...

135
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,787
Just not yet.

136
00:07:41,997 --> 00:07:43,934
Okay, Ember, let's go.

137
00:07:48,577 --> 00:07:51,249
(whimpers softly)

138
00:07:53,453 --> 00:07:58,196
(whispering) I promise
I'll always protect you.

139
00:08:09,185 --> 00:08:11,523
(growling, grunting)

140
00:08:14,696 --> 00:08:16,900
(grunting)

141
00:08:20,942 --> 00:08:22,679
(grunting)

142
00:08:26,887 --> 00:08:29,659
(crying)

143
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:41,517
(crying continues)

144
00:08:52,104 --> 00:08:54,475
(dramatic music)

145
00:08:55,477 --> 00:08:57,214
Approaching the auditorium now.

146
00:08:57,314 --> 00:08:59,084
It's just like the other fires.

147
00:08:59,185 --> 00:09:01,523
Colored smoke, intense light,

148
00:09:01,623 --> 00:09:04,361
and the same strange music.

149
00:09:04,462 --> 00:09:06,499
<i>(man over radio)</i>
<i>Enter with extreme caution.</i>

150
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,938
<i>You know what happened</i>
<i>to the others.</i>

151
00:09:11,543 --> 00:09:14,549
- Send water.
<i>- Sending water.</i>

152
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:17,555
Wait for my order
to open the nozzle.

153
00:09:18,256 --> 00:09:19,926
We're going in.

154
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,464
(dramatic organ music)

155
00:09:34,956 --> 00:09:37,060
Georgia! Come on!

156
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:38,263
(gulps)

157
00:09:38,363 --> 00:09:41,803
Ooh! Yes!

158
00:09:41,904 --> 00:09:43,106
Oh, yeah, hmm...

159
00:09:43,206 --> 00:09:45,578
Georgia, this is your last call!

160
00:09:45,678 --> 00:09:48,249
- Morning, Daddy.
- Finally. Now hurry up and eat.

161
00:09:48,349 --> 00:09:50,955
We have sew much to do today.

162
00:09:51,055 --> 00:09:55,130
Argh, you're hilarious.
You have me in stitches.

163
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,569
Oh, you're as cute
as a button.

164
00:09:57,669 --> 00:10:01,008
Well, we are
cut from the same cloth.

165
00:10:02,946 --> 00:10:05,751
(lively jazz music)

166
00:10:24,054 --> 00:10:25,524
(yawns)

167
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,427
<i>(radio) We interrupt</i>

You know what we need?

175
00:10:39,586 --> 00:10:41,723
Here is Georgia Nolan for WKBZ

176
00:10:41,823 --> 00:10:43,661
interviewing Shawn Nolan.

177
00:10:43,761 --> 00:10:46,065
I heard you hit
a new alteration record today.

178
00:10:46,165 --> 00:10:47,434
Is this true?

179
00:10:47,535 --> 00:10:49,305
Before I answer,
have we punned out yet?

180
00:10:49,405 --> 00:10:50,741
Of course not.

181
00:10:50,841 --> 00:10:54,415
In that case, it seams
I'm going to be inducted

182
00:10:54,516 --> 00:10:56,085
into the sewing
hall of fame.

183
00:10:56,185 --> 00:10:58,156
(chuckles) Nice one.

184
00:10:58,256 --> 00:11:00,160
- (honking)
- (gasps)

185
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,228
(siren wailing)

186
00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:02,865
Do you think it's the arsonist?

187
00:11:02,966 --> 00:11:07,107
I don't know. Anyway, I'm happy
you're not on that truck.

188
00:11:07,207 --> 00:11:09,078
- What do you mean?
- Well, don't you remember?

189
00:11:09,178 --> 00:11:11,883
When you were little,
you wanted to be a fireman?

190
00:11:11,984 --> 00:11:13,286
- Did I?
- Pff...

191
00:11:13,386 --> 00:11:15,858
Oh, yeah. Very, very badly.

192
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:19,633
That's silly.
Girls don't get to be firemen.

193
00:11:19,733 --> 00:11:23,774
Yeah. You could have lived
your dream if you were a boy.

194
00:11:36,032 --> 00:11:37,234
Come on, lazybones.

195
00:11:37,334 --> 00:11:40,975
- (Georgia grunts)
- (Ember snores)

196
00:11:42,311 --> 00:11:44,214
Ember! (grunts)

197
00:11:44,315 --> 00:11:45,483
- Stop!
- (whines)

198
00:11:45,584 --> 00:11:47,889
(Georgia panting)

199
00:11:52,397 --> 00:11:54,335
Girls can't be firemen?

200
00:11:54,435 --> 00:11:56,372
- Give me a break.
- (yawns)

201
00:11:56,472 --> 00:11:59,244
You wanna know
what I think, Ember?

202
00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:01,783
Well, I'll tell you anyway.

203
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:04,556
All these years of training

204
00:12:04,656 --> 00:12:07,595
at night, in the cold,
in the rain, in the snow

205
00:12:07,695 --> 00:12:09,799
are finally gonna pay off.

206
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:12,505
I've worked and worked
and worked

207
00:12:12,605 --> 00:12:13,841
and now my chance is coming.

208
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,245
I can smell it.
Can you smell it?

209
00:12:16,345 --> 00:12:18,550
(whimpers, sniffs)

210
00:12:19,151 --> 00:12:20,988
Smell harder.

211
00:12:22,024 --> 00:12:24,328
- Wait. I hear something.
- Huh?

212
00:12:24,428 --> 00:12:26,499
Ember, shh!

213
00:12:28,537 --> 00:12:30,206
Oh! Look.

214
00:12:30,306 --> 00:12:32,044
Look. The police.

215
00:12:32,144 --> 00:12:34,214
Wh...? Ember. Ember.

216
00:12:34,314 --> 00:12:35,651
Jimmy Murray.

217
00:12:35,751 --> 00:12:37,789
That's Jimmy Murray,
the mayor of New York!

218
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:39,993
- Shawn!
- What's he doing here?

219
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,462
Dad?

220
00:12:41,563 --> 00:12:44,068
- (Shawn) OK.
- They know each other?

221
00:12:44,168 --> 00:12:45,437
I'm going down!

222
00:12:45,538 --> 00:12:48,409
Oh, Ember, don't fuss.
They'll never see me.

223
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,480
(screams silently) Ooh!

224
00:12:50,581 --> 00:12:52,117
- Oh!
- (Jimmy) Listen to me, Shawn.

225
00:12:52,217 --> 00:12:55,825
This arsonist has already
burnt 40 theaters.

226
00:12:55,925 --> 00:13:00,768
And get this, with no flames,
just blue and red smoke.

227
00:13:00,868 --> 00:13:02,872
And creepy music.

228
00:13:02,972 --> 00:13:04,976
(Shawn) The newspapers
spoke of missing firemen...

229
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:08,383
(Jimmy) Nah, idle gossip,
maybe one or two.

230
00:13:08,483 --> 00:13:09,886
- Hah!
- Come on, Jimmy, spill it.

231
00:13:09,986 --> 00:13:11,757
(Jimmy) Alright. All of them.

232
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:13,761
- (whispering) All of them?
- (Shawn) What do you mean?

233
00:13:13,861 --> 00:13:18,737
The firemen that go into the
theaters, they don't come out.

234
00:13:18,837 --> 00:13:21,075
- They just disappear.
- (Georgia gasps)

235
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,479
You're telling me
that all the firemen

236
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,216
in New York have vanished?

237
00:13:25,316 --> 00:13:26,485
(grunts)

238
00:13:26,586 --> 00:13:28,356
All but one.

239
00:13:28,456 --> 00:13:30,060
Oh, no, no, no, Jimmy.

240
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,632
I know what you're gonna ask me,
but I'm out.

241
00:13:32,732 --> 00:13:35,236
Hey, Shabbat Shalom, y'all!
How ya doin'?

242
00:13:35,336 --> 00:13:37,942
Don't forget to vote Jimmy
Murray! Polls open on Tuesday.

243
00:13:38,042 --> 00:13:40,213
Not Saturday.
Good, right?

244
00:13:40,313 --> 00:13:41,550
You got it? Okay.

245
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,620
No excuses, now.
The show must go on!

246
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,724
I gotta do something now.

247
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,632
So I need you to run
the fire investigation,

248
00:13:49,732 --> 00:13:51,903
just for a few days,
for old times' sake...

249
00:13:52,003 --> 00:13:55,176
whaddya say ol' buddy,
ol' pal o' mine?
Oh, please, don't say...

250
00:13:55,276 --> 00:13:56,546
- No.
- No?

251
00:13:56,646 --> 00:13:58,717
(screams silently)

252
00:13:58,817 --> 00:14:00,120
I appreciate the offer, Jimmy.

253
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,959
But I'm a tailor now.
Sorry. I'm sorry.

254
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:05,330
Listen,
I know why you left, Shawn.

255
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:08,269
But this is your chance
to get over what happened.

256
00:14:08,369 --> 00:14:10,574
Finish your career with a bang.

257
00:14:10,674 --> 00:14:12,477
(sighs) I'll never get over it.

258
00:14:12,578 --> 00:14:15,718
- Hmm.
- Good night, Jimmy.

259
00:14:16,352 --> 00:14:17,688
(relieved sigh)

260
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:21,563
The whole city is in danger.

261
00:14:21,663 --> 00:14:25,905
Nobody's safe...
not even your daughter.

262
00:14:26,673 --> 00:14:28,242
(sighs)

263
00:14:31,449 --> 00:14:33,085
- I'll need a team.
- Yes!

264
00:14:33,186 --> 00:14:35,724
Oh-ho-ho...
As many guys as you want.

265
00:14:35,825 --> 00:14:37,160
No, no, no. A small team.

266
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,534
Just a chemist
and a driver, a fast one.

267
00:14:40,634 --> 00:14:42,672
And I want all the evidence
you've got.

268
00:14:42,772 --> 00:14:45,310
Photos, samples, everything.
- Done and done!

269
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:49,752
Your team will be at the
firehouse tomorrow, Shawnie.

270
00:14:49,853 --> 00:14:53,192
Excuse me. Captain Nolan.

271
00:14:54,696 --> 00:14:57,300
(engine roaring)

272
00:14:58,102 --> 00:15:00,574
- (barks)
- I'm okay.

273
00:15:00,674 --> 00:15:02,244
I'm okay.
I'm okay.

274
00:15:02,344 --> 00:15:04,014
(whines)

275
00:15:04,114 --> 00:15:06,418
(Georgia) Oh, my gosh! What kind
of tailoring emergency?

276
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,489
(Shawn)
It's a corduroy disaster.

277
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,993
(gasps)
That does sound serious.

278
00:15:10,093 --> 00:15:12,832
I know, so I have no choice
but to leave you alone

279
00:15:12,932 --> 00:15:14,802
for a couple of days,
and I'm worried.

280
00:15:14,903 --> 00:15:17,174
Relax. Everything will be fine.
Ember will protect me.

281
00:15:17,274 --> 00:15:18,744
Hmm?

282
00:15:18,844 --> 00:15:21,482
Honey, you know what?
Don't work. You know?

283
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:22,985
- Take a personal day.
- Oh!

284
00:15:23,085 --> 00:15:24,488
I didn't know
we had personal days.

285
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:26,192
We do now. You stay home!

286
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,730
Of course.
I have a radio. I'm all set.

287
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:31,870
Dad, go deal
with that corduroy disaster.

288
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,306
- Wait, wait, wait!
- (door bangs shut)

289
00:15:33,406 --> 00:15:34,842
(muffled) Okay, okay!

290
00:15:34,943 --> 00:15:38,216
- Uh, love you! See you tonight.
- So, here's the plan.

291
00:15:38,316 --> 00:15:40,053
(whimpers)

292
00:15:40,153 --> 00:15:42,925
I join Dad's team,
I catch the arsonist,

293
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,762
I save the city,
they change the rules,

294
00:15:44,863 --> 00:15:48,202
and I get to be
the first fireman... woman.

295
00:15:48,302 --> 00:15:49,238
(groans)

296
00:15:49,338 --> 00:15:51,543
For hair,
a mix of engine oil,

297
00:15:51,643 --> 00:15:53,346
black shoe polish and honey.

298
00:15:53,446 --> 00:15:55,918
Marshmallow in the cheeks
to form the jaw.

299
00:15:56,018 --> 00:15:57,354
Putty for the nose.

300
00:15:57,454 --> 00:15:58,557
For thighs, a mix of sawdust

301
00:15:58,657 --> 00:15:59,726
and cucumber peel.

302
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:01,061
Pillows in the shoulders.

303
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:02,899
Egg crate
for the stomach muscles.

304
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:04,434
Mango for the biceps.

305
00:16:04,535 --> 00:16:05,671
(coughs)

306
00:16:05,771 --> 00:16:07,374
(gasps for air)

307
00:16:07,474 --> 00:16:09,646
Don't worry, Ember.
Dad won't recognize me.

308
00:16:09,746 --> 00:16:10,915
(grunts)

309
00:16:11,015 --> 00:16:13,386
And for the mustache,
carpet fringes.

310
00:16:13,486 --> 00:16:14,956
(masculine voice) Huh. Hello.

311
00:16:15,056 --> 00:16:18,564
Why, yeah, I do fight fires...
with my bare hands.

312
00:16:18,664 --> 00:16:20,166
(gasps)

313
00:16:20,266 --> 00:16:22,203
Thanks for giving me
a better idea.

314
00:16:22,304 --> 00:16:24,074
(whimpers)

315
00:16:28,482 --> 00:16:31,221
(masculine voice) Hey, sister,
looking for a mister?

316
00:16:31,322 --> 00:16:32,424
(chuckles)

317
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:33,326
What?

318
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:34,494
Oh!

319
00:16:34,596 --> 00:16:36,131
Okay. Too much.
Too much.

320
00:16:36,231 --> 00:16:38,102
I knew it was too much.
I said it.

321

00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,005
- Hey! Whoa! Hey!
- Watch it, okay!

352
00:18:03,105 --> 00:18:06,211
- Go back to Jersey, you bum!
- Whoa!

353
00:18:10,486 --> 00:18:11,990
Hey! You want a pickle?

354
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:15,029
We got, uh, garlic,
and, uh...

355
00:18:15,129 --> 00:18:16,666
extra garlic too.

356
00:18:16,766 --> 00:18:18,369
Smells like it.

357
00:18:18,469 --> 00:18:20,239
Um, could you point me
in the direction

358
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:21,876
of the Times Square firehouse?

359
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:24,348
Sure, so, uh, what you wanna do

360
00:18:24,448 --> 00:18:28,089
is take your first right
onto Who Cares Street.

361
00:18:28,189 --> 00:18:31,028
Then head straight down to, uh,
oh, what is it again?

362
00:18:31,128 --> 00:18:35,036
Oh, right.
Do-I-Look-Like-a-Map Boulevard!

363
00:18:35,136 --> 00:18:37,374
Whoa! Thank you, sir.

364
00:18:37,474 --> 00:18:39,779
That's so kind of you.

365
00:18:39,879 --> 00:18:42,852
Lousy tourist.
Didn't even buy a pickle.

366
00:18:42,952 --> 00:18:44,822
- Garlic pickle?
- Argh!

367
00:18:44,922 --> 00:18:47,093
(man) Taxi! (whistles)

368
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,211
(soft music)

369
00:18:58,884 --> 00:19:01,088
H... Hello? (clears throat)

370
00:19:01,188 --> 00:19:03,125
(masculine voice)
I mean, hello!

371
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:06,165
Anyone here? (gasps)

372
00:19:13,012 --> 00:19:15,283
(chuckles)

373
00:19:15,383 --> 00:19:18,222
(epic music)

374
00:19:24,301 --> 00:19:27,908
(grunts, chuckles happily)

375
00:19:29,645 --> 00:19:32,350
(hums)

376
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,687
Hey!

377
00:19:33,787 --> 00:19:35,524
Hi!

378
00:19:35,624 --> 00:19:37,995
Ting. Pooh!

379
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:39,632
(horn blares)

380
00:19:40,634 --> 00:19:42,270
(clears throat)

381
00:19:49,417 --> 00:19:51,455
Huh...

382
00:19:56,131 --> 00:19:57,500
Oh!
(chuckling)

383
00:19:58,035 --> 00:20:00,339
(gasps)
Huh...

384
00:20:02,343 --> 00:20:03,914
Are you one of the volunteers?

385
00:20:04,014 --> 00:20:06,452
(clears throat)
Mm-hm.

386
00:20:07,755 --> 00:20:10,493
Do I know you?

387
00:20:10,594 --> 00:20:12,230
Mh-mm-mm-mm-mh.

388
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,735
Come on, then. You're late.

389
00:20:14,836 --> 00:20:16,539
(relieved sigh)

390
00:20:18,643 --> 00:20:20,480
(frame clanging)

391
00:20:20,581 --> 00:20:21,683
Pfff!

392
00:20:21,783 --> 00:20:23,352
Okay, I'm Captain Shawn Nolan

393
00:20:23,452 --> 00:20:25,891
and I will be running
the fire investigation.

394
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:30,767
We have an arsonist to stop
and we have 800 firemen to find.

395
00:20:30,868 --> 00:20:33,472
Now, I know you aren't
professionals and it's a...

396
00:20:33,573 --> 00:20:34,942
Oh, yes! Yes!

397
00:20:35,042 --> 00:20:36,813
An amazing speech!

398
00:20:36,913 --> 00:20:38,282
Goosebumps!
I'm telling you.

399
00:20:38,382 --> 00:20:39,919
(whispering) We have no time.

400
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:41,556
Let me introduce your team.

401
00:20:41,656 --> 00:20:45,329
Now, here's the brains
of your operation, Ricardo.

402
00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:47,400
- Your chemist.
- Actually, sir,

403
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,404
I would describe myself more
as a physicist,

404
00:20:49,505 --> 00:20:52,010
given my experiments
on Einstein's theory of quanta

405
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,314
in photoelectric effects
in kinetic energy.

406
00:20:54,414 --> 00:20:57,287
- (gasps)
- That's my man!

407
00:20:57,387 --> 00:20:59,090
He talks like a calculator.

408
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:01,328
Where did you graduate
college, Ricardo?

409
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:04,969
Actually I, uh, do my research
at home in my basement.

410
00:21:05,069 --> 00:21:07,040
- Hmm...
- Where I live with my mama.

411
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,810
- (Shawn growls)
- Very nice.

412
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,346
Home school. Amazing.

413
00:21:10,446 --> 00:21:11,983
You did that with your kid,
right, Shawn?

414
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,485
Oh... yeah, yeah, yeah.

415
00:21:13,587 --> 00:21:16,526
Jin's your driver.
Fastest cabbie in Manhattan.

416
00:21:16,626 --> 00:21:19,532
Everyone knows him as
the Checker Cheetah of Chelsea.

417
00:21:19,632 --> 00:21:21,068
Yeah, I'm the Cheetah.

418
00:21:21,168 --> 00:21:22,738
The Cheetah? How old are you?

419
00:21:22,838 --> 00:21:24,140
- Fifteen, sir.
- Fifteen?

420
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,677
- Twenty-one.
- You just said fifteen.

421
00:21:25,777 --> 00:21:27,213
No, I said twenty-one.

422
00:21:27,313 --> 00:21:29,619
- He said fifteen.
- No, no, he said twenty-one.

423
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:33,760
Oh... And who's this third one?
I only asked for the two.

424
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,532
- Wait. You didn't find him?
- Me? No. Who are you?

425
00:21:36,633 --> 00:21:39,939
Oh, me? Uh, I'm Georg...
uh, Georg...

426
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:42,945
Gior-gio,
Giorgio, Giorgio. Joe!

427
00:21:43,045 --> 00:21:44,849
I'm Joe! I'm Joe!
I'm a fireman.

428
00:21:44,949 --> 00:21:46,753
I'm Joe the fireman!
Fireman Joe.

429
00:21:46,853 --> 00:21:48,723
(chuckles, grunts)

430
00:21:48,823 --> 00:21:50,259
(farts)

431
00:21:51,696 --> 00:21:54,234
A fireman?
Are you sure I don't know you?

432
00:21:54,334 --> 00:21:58,175
No! No, no.
I live, I live, uh, far away.

433
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,747
Uh, I'm a man.
And I'm strong.

434
00:22:00,847 --> 00:22:02,483
- I'm strong!
- Take him.

435
00:22:02,585 --> 00:22:04,789
- I'm a fireman.
- He has experience.

436
00:22:04,889 --> 00:22:06,458
Alright. Welcome...

437
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,795
Ugh.

438
00:22:07,895 --> 00:22:08,897
- ...aboard!
- Ho!

439
00:22:08,997 --> 00:22:11,401
Oh, uh, I'm a sweater.

440
00:22:11,502 --> 00:22:14,107
(chuckles)
Uh, and I eat a lot of mangoes.

441
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,278
- A lot of mangoes.
- Can I uh, talk to you?

442
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:18,950
- You can taste it...
- Tell me this is a joke.

443
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:21,623
Nah, they're the only ones
who accepted
this suicide mission.

444
00:22:21,723 --> 00:22:23,860
I mean potentially suic...
You know what I mean.

445
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,433
- I'm strong and a fireman!
- (alarm ringing)

446
00:22:27,534 --> 00:22:29,437
Okay, team, suit up!
Suit up! Suit up!

447
00:22:29,538 --> 00:22:32,745
- Excuse me? For what?
- Maybe a fire?

448
00:22:32,845 --> 00:22:34,014
Oh!

449
00:22:34,114 --> 00:22:35,584
(rapid breathing)

450
00:22:35,684 --> 00:22:37,053
Ooh!

451
00:22:37,153 --> 00:22:39,190
- Oh, good gravy!
- Good luck, my friend.

452
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:42,831
City is counting on me!
I mean, you. Counting on you.

453
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:51,148
I'm actually doing this?
Hoo!

454
00:22:52,551 --> 00:22:55,590
(Ricardo reciting a prayer)

455
00:23:02,805 --> 00:23:05,042
(chuckles)

456
00:23:05,142 --> 00:23:07,514
Come on, you know
there's an alarm, right?

457
00:23:07,614 --> 00:23:09,384
We shouldn't be wasting
our time.

458
00:23:09,484 --> 00:23:11,388
(tires screeching)

459
00:23:11,488 --> 00:23:14,294
Hey!
Easy there, Cheetah!

460
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:16,198
Relax.
I'm an expert driver.

461
00:23:16,298 --> 00:23:18,102
In a cab, not a ladder truck!

462
00:23:18,202 --> 00:23:20,373
One's red, one's yellow,
same diff!

463
00:23:20,473 --> 00:23:22,377
The Cheetah's back!

464
00:23:22,477 --> 00:23:24,582
Whoa!

465
00:23:26,051 --> 00:23:27,453
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

466
00:23:27,554 --> 00:23:30,393
Wrong way!
Turn around! Turn around!

467
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:33,733
But this is my shortcut.
Normally I'd ask for a tip.

468
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:36,939
Normally a fifteen-year-old kid
doesn't drive a ladder truck!

469
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,975
I'm twenty-one.

470
00:23:38,075 --> 00:23:39,310
In Cheetah years?

471
00:23:39,411 --> 00:23:41,616
- Yeah, baby!
- Are you okay?

472
00:23:41,716 --> 00:23:43,887
(Ricardo vomits)

473
00:23:43,987 --> 00:23:45,156
(gasps) Oh no!

474
00:23:45,256 --> 00:23:47,528
Oh! No, no, no, no, no!
Oh, not good.

475
00:23:50,366 --> 00:23:53,372
(jazz music)

476
00:23:56,713 --> 00:24:01,589
Nice. Wha...
That's it. Whoa, whoa.

477
00:24:03,893 --> 00:24:06,298
Whoa! Oh...

478
00:24:06,999 --> 00:24:08,603
Beautiful butt hair.

479
00:24:08,703 --> 00:24:09,905
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

480
00:24:10,005 --> 00:24:11,007
Oh, I could be

481
00:24:11,108 --> 00:24:13,312
doing alterations right now.

482
00:24:13,412 --> 00:24:15,282
Whoa... Whoaaa!

483
00:24:15,383 --> 00:24:17,988
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa!

484
00:24:18,088 --> 00:24:22,664
<i>♪ I got pickles in my pocket</i>
<i>and I don't care who knows... ♪</i>

485
00:24:22,765 --> 00:24:25,436
Help me! Help me!
Help me, please!

486
00:24:25,537 --> 00:24:27,340
(Shawn) Watch out!

487
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,044
(Ricardo) Dividing
the width of the truck

488
00:24:29,144 --> 00:24:30,346
by the width of the road,

489
00:24:30,446 --> 00:24:31,883
I calculate
a 99% chance of death!

490
00:24:31,983 --> 00:24:33,653
(Shawn) Jin, did you hear him?

491
00:24:33,753 --> 00:24:36,358
Jin, did you hear him regarding
our chances of survival?

492
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:38,596
Jin, stop the engine!
Jin, stop this truck!

493
00:24:38,696 --> 00:24:42,203
Stop the truck! Jin! Jin!

494
00:24:49,217 --> 00:24:51,823
Captain, look!
We saved 12 seconds!

495
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:57,033
No more shortcuts allowed!
No more shortcuts allowed.

496
00:24:57,133 --> 00:25:00,574
Okay, the theater is
on the next block. Get ready.

497
00:25:00,674 --> 00:25:03,212
Tanks on and follow my orders.

498
00:25:03,312 --> 00:25:04,915
- Any questions?
- What?

499
00:25:05,015 --> 00:25:06,753
Oh, hi. What did I miss?

500
00:25:06,853 --> 00:25:08,455
The street!

501
00:25:09,825 --> 00:25:12,531
(all yelling)

502
00:25:14,134 --> 00:25:17,306
Oh, Captain, are we there yet?

503
00:25:17,406 --> 00:25:20,914
- Not yet.
- Hmm...

504
00:25:25,356 --> 00:25:26,926
Whoa!

505
00:25:28,295 --> 00:25:31,401
- Wow!
- Wh... What is it?

506
00:25:31,501 --> 00:25:34,140
I don't know... Ricardo?

507
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,148
It could be potassium or copper
acetate, maybe lithium chlorate.

508
00:25:38,248 --> 00:25:41,622
But that would only make sense
for the flames, not the smoke.

509
00:25:41,722 --> 00:25:44,762
I need to run tests.
At home. With <i>mi mama.</i>

510
00:25:44,862 --> 00:25:47,333
Arsonist,
we're coming to get you!

511
00:25:47,433 --> 00:25:50,907
Yeah! We're gonna kick
your flaming multicolored butt!

512
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:54,047
Yeah!
(laughing)

513
00:25:54,147 --> 00:25:55,951
- Hmm.
- Captain, what's going on?

514
00:25:56,051 --> 00:25:59,090
Some arsonists like to come back
to the scene of the crime,

515
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,594
so keep your eyes peeled.

516
00:26:00,694 --> 00:26:03,566
(Georgia) Keep my eyes peeled,
got it.

517
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:05,369
Hmm...

518
00:26:07,975 --> 00:26:09,612
Who is that?

519
00:26:09,712 --> 00:26:12,651
(high-pitched voice) Only the
most luminous star on Broadway:

520
00:26:12,751 --> 00:26:15,389
Laura Divine.
(clears throat)

521
00:26:15,489 --> 00:26:18,095
Captain Neil, Chief of
the New York Police Department.

522
00:26:18,195 --> 00:26:19,665
Shawn Nolan.

523
00:26:19,765 --> 00:26:21,468
Happy to have you on
the fire investigation, Captain.

524
00:26:21,569 --> 00:26:24,440
With you here, the police,
led by yours truly,

525
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:26,211
can now focus
on finding the missing firemen.

526
00:26:26,311 --> 00:26:27,548
Glad to be of service, Captain.

527
00:26:27,648 --> 00:26:29,484
Amazing!
We secured the perimeter,

528
00:26:29,585 --> 00:26:31,488
and there are no civilians
inside the building.

529
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:33,626
- Empty!
- Thank you, Captain Neil.

530
00:26:33,726 --> 00:26:35,362
Okay, I'll go see
what we're up against.

531
00:26:35,462 --> 00:26:38,001
- Joe, stretch a line.
- Right away, Captain.

532
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,172
Ah!

533
00:26:40,272 --> 00:26:42,678
Really hope no one saw that.

534
00:26:44,347 --> 00:26:45,784
(grunts)

535
00:26:51,662 --> 00:26:53,867
Slow down, Joe!
Did you even check the...

536
00:26:53,967 --> 00:26:55,035
Aaah!

537
00:26:55,135 --> 00:26:57,473
(sighs)
The water pressure.

538
00:26:58,141 --> 00:26:59,745
(screaming)

539
00:27:00,446 --> 00:27:01,582
(laughs)

540
00:27:01,682 --> 00:27:02,985
That's one crazy hose.

541
00:27:03,085 --> 00:27:04,320
It's not the hose.

542
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,258
- (screaming)
- (Jin) Stay calm!

543
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:07,861
Stay calm!

544
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:10,466
Okay, panic! Panic!

545
00:27:10,567 --> 00:27:13,873
I miss my mama!
I want to go...

546
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:16,211
(screaming)

547
00:27:16,311 --> 00:27:18,650
It will be fine!
I'm coming, buddy!

548
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,085
Eeeh...

549
00:27:29,304 --> 00:27:31,441
(panting)

550
00:27:31,542 --> 00:27:33,478
You said you had training.

551
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:36,051
- I've been training for years.
- Where, clown school?

552
00:27:36,151 --> 00:27:38,690
Never mind. Come with me.
We're gonna water the front.

553
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,594
But if the smoke
contains cyanogen,

554
00:27:40,694 --> 00:27:43,098
you'll die of hypoxia
in only 29 seconds!

555
00:27:43,198 --> 00:27:46,037
That's why I need you
to collect smoke samples.

556
00:27:46,137 --> 00:27:49,210
And that's why I'm going home!

557
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:51,381
- (birds chirping)
- Great!

558
00:27:51,481 --> 00:27:54,989
Okay, we all know
that firemen who go inside
burning theaters disappear,

559
00:27:55,089 --> 00:27:57,260
they vanish,
but that will not happen to us

560
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,299
because we will stay outside
watering the front
until the fire is out.

561
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:04,107
Then and only then will we
go inside and look for clues.

562
00:28:04,207 --> 00:28:06,211
Okay?
Jin, extend the ladder.

563
00:28:06,311 --> 00:28:08,181
- Extend the ladder!
- Ugh!

564
00:28:08,282 --> 00:28:09,685
(sighs)

565
00:28:11,154 --> 00:28:15,730
On it like a bonnet.
Let's get vertical, people.

566
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:18,870
Top floor: ladies' hosiery,

567
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,540
Brylcreem,

568
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,011
and arsonists.

569
00:28:23,111 --> 00:28:25,517
(whimpering)

570
00:28:28,589 --> 00:28:31,696
(dramatic music)

571
00:28:38,977 --> 00:28:41,816
(panting)

572
00:28:44,253 --> 00:28:46,358
Get a load of me.

573
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,529
- I'm a natural.
- Oh!

574
00:28:48,629 --> 00:28:51,234
Jin, wake up!
Wake up, please!

575
00:28:51,334 --> 00:28:54,007
- He's asleep! Jin!
- Stop, Jin!

576
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:56,244
- Hold on!
- Whoa!

577
00:28:56,344 --> 00:28:59,017
(clattering)

578
00:28:59,117 --> 00:29:01,555
(both grunting)

579
00:29:02,524 --> 00:29:05,229
(coughs)

580
00:29:08,135 --> 00:29:10,439
(coughs)

581
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,410
How is this possible?

582
00:29:12,511 --> 00:29:13,913
I have no idea!

583
00:29:14,013 --> 00:29:15,917
Back up.
We shouldn't be in here.

584
00:29:16,017 --> 00:29:17,888
That wasn't the plan.
We're getting out now!

585
00:29:17,988 --> 00:29:20,025
Captain!
Captain, I saw something move.

586
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,129
- Never mind that now. Come on!
- I got this!

587
00:29:22,229 --> 00:29:24,535
No, no, no! Joe, that's an...
Oh, for Pete's sake!

588
00:29:24,635 --> 00:29:26,404
What is it,
ignore the captain day?

589
00:29:26,505 --> 00:29:30,245
(coughing, rapid breathing)

590
00:29:32,016 --> 00:29:34,487
(dramatic music)

591
00:29:34,588 --> 00:29:36,525
Ahh!

592
00:29:39,832 --> 00:29:41,368
(coughs)

593
00:29:41,468 --> 00:29:43,271
(panting)

594
00:29:43,372 --> 00:29:45,577
I know you're here somewhere!

595
00:29:45,677 --> 00:29:47,380
You show yourself!

596
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,918
(panting)

597
00:29:51,555 --> 00:29:54,093
(hissing)

598
00:29:54,193 --> 00:29:56,899
<i>I thought I disposed</i>
<i>of all of your kind.</i>

599
00:29:56,999 --> 00:29:58,569
You... You don't scare me.

600
00:29:58,669 --> 00:30:00,139
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

601
00:30:00,239 --> 00:30:03,078
Aaahh!

602
00:30:03,178 --> 00:30:06,552
In the name
of the great city of New York,

603
00:30:06,652 --> 00:30:09,290
you're...
you're under arrest!

604
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,394
<i>How cute. Here.</i>

605
00:30:11,494 --> 00:30:13,866
- Catch.
- Oh!

606
00:30:15,002 --> 00:30:16,371
Aaah!

607
00:30:16,471 --> 00:30:18,041
(loud orchestral music)

608
00:30:18,141 --> 00:30:19,578
Ah!

609
00:30:21,214 --> 00:30:22,617
What was that?

610
00:30:22,717 --> 00:30:24,220
(shaky breathing)

611
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,623
The arsonist.

612
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:27,493
Were you planning
on dancing with him?

613
00:30:27,594 --> 00:30:28,863
Stop that!

614
00:30:28,963 --> 00:30:30,165
We have to get out of here.

615
00:30:30,265 --> 00:30:32,336
Right now! Come on!

616
00:30:37,313 --> 00:30:38,583
(coughing)

617
00:30:38,683 --> 00:30:40,787
Oh, thank goodness!
They're alive!

618
00:30:40,887 --> 00:30:42,389
They're alive, everyone!

619
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:45,797
- Come quickly! Quickly!
- (coughing, gasping for air)

620
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:48,903
You...

621
00:30:49,003 --> 00:30:52,911
- (Jin) You just saw a ghost!
- (Ricardo) A ghost?

622
00:30:53,011 --> 00:30:54,982
Okay, that's where
I draw the line. The occult?

623
00:30:55,082 --> 00:30:57,052
- I am done!
- I don't know what it was.

624
00:30:57,153 --> 00:30:59,858
What I do know is I almost
caught the arsonist.

625
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:01,762
Hey, Captain, I was just
telling them abo...

626
00:31:01,862 --> 00:31:03,866
Telling them what?
That it was a fiasco?

627
00:31:03,966 --> 00:31:05,804
Actually, Comandante,
I would say it's a success

628
00:31:05,904 --> 00:31:07,439
considering we are still alive.

629
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:09,010
Of course you're alive.
You ran!

630
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:13,084
True, but in my defense,
I didn't get very far.

631
00:31:13,185 --> 00:31:14,120
Firemen go in together,

632
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,057
stay together,
come out together.

633
00:31:16,157 --> 00:31:18,729
- That's how this works.
- Yes, Comandante.

634
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:21,836
And Jin, explain to me
how you fell asleep.

635
00:31:21,936 --> 00:31:26,010
Not me, Jackson.
The Cheetah never falls as...

636
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,848
(snores)

637
00:31:27,948 --> 00:31:28,916
(sighs)

638
00:31:29,016 --> 00:31:32,223
What? Oh, hi.
What did I miss?

639
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:33,860
Oh... Okay.

640
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:38,669
Sometimes I "faint"
when my emotions are too strong.

641
00:31:38,769 --> 00:31:41,007
I was "fired" by the cab company

642
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:44,013
for "allegedly"
running over a newsstand.

643
00:31:44,113 --> 00:31:47,186
I guess I "should" have
told you, Captain.

644
00:31:47,286 --> 00:31:48,756
(long exhale) Hmm.

645
00:31:48,856 --> 00:31:50,793
Anybody got anything else
to tell me?

646
00:31:50,894 --> 00:31:53,165
- Mm-mm.
- No, Captain.

647
00:31:53,265 --> 00:31:54,935
We won't disappoint you again,
Captain.

648
00:31:55,035 --> 00:31:56,739
I wasn't talking to you, Joe.

649
00:31:56,839 --> 00:31:58,709
You lied to me, and that's it.

650
00:31:58,809 --> 00:32:01,982
I don't wanna see you
around here ever again.

651
00:32:03,719 --> 00:32:05,757
(clears throat)
Captain, Nolan.

652
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:08,228
My men haven't seen
any more signs of smoke.

653
00:32:08,328 --> 00:32:10,600
You're clear to enter
and start your investigation.

654
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,269
Thank you, Captain Neil.

655
00:32:12,369 --> 00:32:14,975
I'll use the stage door.

656
00:32:17,914 --> 00:32:19,718
Captain! Captain!

657
00:32:19,818 --> 00:32:21,555
Go back to wherever
you came from, Joe.

658
00:32:21,655 --> 00:32:25,530
I just wanna say you're right.
I'm not a real fireman... yet.

659
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:27,433
But it's all I've ever wanted.

660
00:32:27,534 --> 00:32:30,940
I've read every single book
and I train every single day,

661
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,715
but firefighting for real is...
well, it's a lot different.

662
00:32:34,815 --> 00:32:36,585
Of course it's a lot different.
It's not a game.

663
00:32:36,685 --> 00:32:37,954
And pretending
you were a fireman

664
00:32:38,054 --> 00:32:39,758
put all our lives at risk.

665
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,697
I'm a father, Joe.

666
00:32:42,797 --> 00:32:44,635
I need to go home at night.

667
00:32:44,735 --> 00:32:46,037
You understand me?

668
00:32:46,137 --> 00:32:48,308
Yeah. Yeah. Believe me, I do.

669
00:32:48,408 --> 00:32:50,914
But I really wanna help you
stop the arsonist.

670
00:32:51,014 --> 00:32:53,251
Please, please give me
another chance.

671
00:32:56,357 --> 00:32:58,128
(sighs)

672
00:33:01,669 --> 00:33:03,773
Hmm.

673
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,977
(door creaks)

674
00:33:06,077 --> 00:33:09,216
Complete honesty from
here on in. Do you understand?

675
00:33:09,317 --> 00:33:12,089
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

676
00:33:12,189 --> 00:33:14,828
Yeah, yeah. Okay.
Now follow me.

677
00:33:14,928 --> 00:33:17,166
(under her breath) Yes!

678
00:33:18,368 --> 00:33:19,871
Cheetah loves that guy.

679
00:33:19,972 --> 00:33:23,378
He's the cat's pajamas.
(snores)

680
00:33:28,522 --> 00:33:29,958
Oh...

681
00:33:30,058 --> 00:33:32,029
(Shawn) What is going on?

682
00:33:32,129 --> 00:33:34,668
This isn't normal, is it?

683
00:33:34,768 --> 00:33:36,170
No...

684
00:33:36,271 --> 00:33:39,243
We're about 40 miles
from normal.

685
00:33:39,343 --> 00:33:41,381
- Um...
- Oh!

686
00:33:41,481 --> 00:33:42,984
Sorry.

687
00:33:43,084 --> 00:33:44,855
(uncomfortable chuckle)

688
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:50,232
(Shawn) Everything is burnt to
a crisp and yet still standing.

689
00:33:50,332 --> 00:33:53,238
How could the fire
burn the entire auditorium

690
00:33:53,338 --> 00:33:55,475
but not destroy
the rest of the theater?

691
00:33:55,576 --> 00:33:57,079
That's the question.

692
00:33:57,179 --> 00:33:58,516
Mm-hm...

693
00:33:58,616 --> 00:34:01,922
It's burning, but it's cold.

694
00:34:02,022 --> 00:34:04,594
- Don't touch it...
- Oops.

695
00:34:04,695 --> 00:34:06,932
Unless I say you can.

696
00:34:07,032 --> 00:34:09,170
Could have been worse...

697
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:10,974
(gasps)

698
00:34:11,074 --> 00:34:13,813
- (chuckles nervously)
- Good grief...

699
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,482
Okay...

700
00:34:15,583 --> 00:34:19,825
To collect clues,
you have to use your senses.

701
00:34:20,492 --> 00:34:23,198
Touch... Sight.

702
00:34:23,298 --> 00:34:25,168
Sound...

703
00:34:25,268 --> 00:34:27,874
(retching)

704
00:34:27,974 --> 00:34:29,778
I didn't say taste.

705
00:34:29,878 --> 00:34:31,882
I was gonna say smell.

706
00:34:31,982 --> 00:34:33,953
(sneezes)

707
00:34:36,525 --> 00:34:38,896
Do you think that's
what happened to the firemen?

708
00:34:38,996 --> 00:34:41,401
I... I mean, vaporized?

709
00:34:41,501 --> 00:34:43,104
Hmm. One step at a time.

710
00:34:43,204 --> 00:34:45,877
First we have to figure out
the origin of the fire

711
00:34:45,977 --> 00:34:47,079
to know what happened.

712
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:48,949
The origin, got it.

713
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:50,653
Each fire has a story.

714
00:34:50,753 --> 00:34:53,224
We are looking for various
marks and patterns

715
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:55,963
imprinted by the smoke,
heat, and fire.

716
00:34:56,064 --> 00:34:58,134
And when we find these patterns,

717
00:34:58,234 --> 00:35:01,407
we can trace the path of fire
back to its origin.

718
00:35:01,508 --> 00:35:03,546
Good golly.

719
00:35:03,646 --> 00:35:05,248
Hey!

720
00:35:05,349 --> 00:35:06,685
Am I boring you?

721
00:35:06,785 --> 00:35:08,421
- Dad!
- What?

722
00:35:08,522 --> 00:35:10,092
Uh, had, ha...

723
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:12,062
I had... I have... Pfff!

724
00:35:12,162 --> 00:35:13,866
I have something to show you.
Come here!

725
00:35:13,966 --> 00:35:15,970
Uh...
This better be good, kid.

726
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,807
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's good.
Come here. Look.

727
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:20,613
Hurry up. Come on.

728
00:35:20,713 --> 00:35:22,584
Look! Look at the impact!

729
00:35:22,684 --> 00:35:24,320
(Shawn) Whoa...

730
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:27,226
Whatever it was,
it was thrown from here...

731
00:35:27,326 --> 00:35:30,098
From the stage.
He's not an arsonist.

732
00:35:30,198 --> 00:35:32,871
I mean, he is, but he sees
himself as a performer...

733
00:35:32,971 --> 00:35:35,877
Doing a show,
with lights and music.

734
00:35:35,977 --> 00:35:38,883
Interesting... but just a theory

735
00:35:38,983 --> 00:35:42,557
unless we can figure out
what caused that impact.

736
00:35:42,657 --> 00:35:44,393
Hmm.

737
00:35:44,493 --> 00:35:45,362
This?

738
00:35:45,462 --> 00:35:46,698
Hmm?

739
00:35:46,799 --> 00:35:49,070
The arsonist threw it at me.

740
00:35:51,407 --> 00:35:52,944
Mm-hm.

741
00:35:53,044 --> 00:35:56,217
You just found
the origin of the story.

742
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,889
Well done, son.

743
00:35:58,989 --> 00:36:01,562
I like that you call me "son."
(chuckles)

744
00:36:01,662 --> 00:36:03,999
Firemen are a big family.

745
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,538
Let's take this back
to the firehouse.

746
00:36:06,638 --> 00:36:09,477
Huh. Origin of the story!

747
00:36:09,578 --> 00:36:12,015
Yes! Ooh!

748
00:36:12,116 --> 00:36:13,919
(clears throat)
Sorry...

749
00:36:14,019 --> 00:36:16,157
Something in my throat.

750
00:36:17,226 --> 00:36:19,063
(Shawn) Hey, Joe, come on!

751
00:36:19,163 --> 00:36:20,800
(locker door bangs shut)

752
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,537
Ah, this is great!

753
00:36:22,637 --> 00:36:25,977
We'll give it to Ricardo first
thing in the morning to analyze.

754
00:36:26,077 --> 00:36:28,248
I haven't seen you
this happy in a long time.

755
00:36:28,348 --> 00:36:31,120
Yeah? Well, you've known me
since this morning.

756
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:34,093
Oh, of course. It's just,
uh, I feel like I've known you

757
00:36:34,193 --> 00:36:35,696
my, you know, my whole life.

758
00:36:35,797 --> 00:36:36,698
Yeah, really?

759
00:36:36,799 --> 00:36:40,138
- Oh, God!
- Ow!

760
00:36:40,238 --> 00:36:41,608
Say hello to the brave men

761
00:36:41,708 --> 00:36:44,079
who are going to bring
the arsonist to justice!

762
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,248
(reporters ask questions)

763
00:36:45,348 --> 00:36:46,919
You called the press, Jimmy?

764
00:36:47,019 --> 00:36:49,089
Sorry. City Hall leaks
like a sieve.

765
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:51,528
Let today put an end
to the rumors

766
00:36:51,628 --> 00:36:54,868
about there being fewer
and fewer firemen to protect us!

767
00:36:54,968 --> 00:36:56,972
- See, here...
- Oh!

768
00:36:57,072 --> 00:37:00,011
... is Joe,
a truly unique fireman.

769
00:37:00,111 --> 00:37:01,481
He's strong.

770
00:37:01,582 --> 00:37:03,117
He's a real man.

771
00:37:03,218 --> 00:37:05,790
Don't look at me.
You look into the camera.

772
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,392
You're working
for my re-election.

773
00:37:07,493 --> 00:37:09,831
- Look happy. Now go!
- You're crushing my hand! Oh!

774
00:37:09,931 --> 00:37:12,002
Don't forget to vote
Jimmy Murray.

775
00:37:12,102 --> 00:37:13,539
Polls open on Tuesday!

776
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:15,576
The show must go on!

777
00:37:15,676 --> 00:37:19,416
Captain, Jimmy is using
this crisis to get re-elected.

778
00:37:19,518 --> 00:37:21,420
Yeah, tell me something
I don't know.

779
00:37:21,522 --> 00:37:24,160
Okay. I... I think
he's the arsonist!

780
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,030
(chuckles)
Jimmy? No way.

781
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:28,434
He'd sell out his own
grandmother to get re-elected.

782
00:37:28,536 --> 00:37:31,040
Actually, he did. She's doing
three years in Sing Sing...

783
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,812
But arson?
Nah, he's not that kind of guy.

784
00:37:33,913 --> 00:37:36,184
- I know you're friends, but...
- Don't run, Joe.

785
00:37:36,284 --> 00:37:40,292
- Firemen walk with purpose.
- But I am walking.

786
00:37:40,392 --> 00:37:43,666
It's an expression, son. It
means don't jump to conclusions.

787
00:37:43,766 --> 00:37:46,070
Oh, yeah, no, I knew that.
I knew that.

788
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:48,208
No, you didn't.
But I like your spirit.

789
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:49,878
Alright, Joe, go home.

790
00:37:49,978 --> 00:37:53,218
Come on. Tomorrow will be
critical and I need you rested.

791
00:37:53,318 --> 00:37:55,790
And, yeah, I'm happy.

792
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:58,394
I've missed all this.

793
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:02,871
I knew you did.

794
00:38:02,971 --> 00:38:05,375
And you gave it all up for me.

795
00:38:06,043 --> 00:38:07,145
Hoh! Hoh!

796
00:38:07,246 --> 00:38:09,083
Gotta fly!

797
00:38:09,183 --> 00:38:12,523
(lively jazz music)

798
00:38:19,436 --> 00:38:21,140
Oh!

799
00:38:27,052 --> 00:38:29,390
Oh! Hey! Hey! Ember!

800
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:30,993
- Ember!
- (barks)

801
00:38:31,093 --> 00:38:33,666
Hey! Hey! Hey, Ember!

802
00:38:33,766 --> 00:38:36,270
- Yes! Yes! I'm home!
- Hey!

803
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:38,107
Hooo! My little
doggie doggie-doodoo.

804
00:38:38,207 --> 00:38:40,478
How are ya?
Did you girls have a nice day?

805
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,917
What's this smile
you're giving me. That's sweet.

806
00:38:43,017 --> 00:38:45,055
Hmm?

807
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:47,894
(panting)

808
00:38:47,994 --> 00:38:50,432
Let's go see what Georgia's
been up to, shall we?

809
00:38:50,533 --> 00:38:54,239
She won't believe
the day I've had.

810
00:38:56,812 --> 00:38:59,049
Upstairs.

811
00:39:00,085 --> 00:39:01,655
Hey, Georgia, I'm back!

812
00:39:01,755 --> 00:39:04,126
I'll be right up!

813
00:39:10,873 --> 00:39:12,710
(panting)

814
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:14,446
(Georgia) Hey, Ember!

815
00:39:15,616 --> 00:39:17,887
Stall him!
Stall him, please.

816
00:39:17,987 --> 00:39:19,824
(Shawn) Georgia?

817
00:39:23,097 --> 00:39:25,770
(knocking)
Are you there, Georgia?

818
00:39:27,974 --> 00:39:29,343
(barking)

819
00:39:29,443 --> 00:39:30,646
How was your day?

820
00:39:30,746 --> 00:39:32,015
(whimpers) Ruff!

821
00:39:32,115 --> 00:39:33,819
Yeah, mine was
pretty rough too.

822
00:39:33,919 --> 00:39:36,090
(chuckles)
Can I come in?

823
00:39:36,558 --> 00:39:38,328
(grunts)

824
00:39:38,428 --> 00:39:40,700
- Wha...?
- (whimpers)

825
00:39:42,002 --> 00:39:44,774
- Hey, Dad. How was your day?
- What?

826
00:39:44,874 --> 00:39:47,780
I'll be with you
in one second?

827
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,517
Did you see that, Ember?

828
00:39:49,617 --> 00:39:51,153
(whimpers)

829
00:39:51,253 --> 00:39:53,692
Gotta switch to decaf.

830
00:39:55,629 --> 00:39:58,167
(panting)

831
00:39:58,267 --> 00:40:01,207
Wow. You're so good
under pressure.

832
00:40:01,307 --> 00:40:03,077
(whimpers)

833
00:40:03,177 --> 00:40:05,181
Dad, tell me everything
that happened

834
00:40:05,281 --> 00:40:06,885
with the corduroy crisis.

835
00:40:06,985 --> 00:40:08,388
The what? Oh, right!

836
00:40:08,488 --> 00:40:10,225
The corduroy crisis!

837
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:12,029
Oh! Oh! It was...

838
00:40:12,129 --> 00:40:14,466
It was... terrifying.

839
00:40:14,567 --> 00:40:17,674
The lines, they were going
the wrong way.

840
00:40:17,774 --> 00:40:20,846
- And there was the texture...
- Oh, wow...

841
00:40:20,946 --> 00:40:22,550
What?

842
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:25,355
I just think you're amazing,

843
00:40:25,455 --> 00:40:28,996
and I think I'm lucky
to have you as my dad.

844
00:40:29,096 --> 00:40:30,833
(soft chuckle)

845
00:40:30,933 --> 00:40:32,603
Well, it'll be over soon,

846
00:40:32,704 --> 00:40:35,241
and we'll get back
to our quiet,

847
00:40:35,341 --> 00:40:37,980
safe and peaceful little life.

848
00:40:38,081 --> 00:40:40,519
Tsk. I can't wait.

849
00:40:44,694 --> 00:40:47,466
(dramatic music)

850
00:40:48,301 --> 00:40:49,704
<i>Sorry, boys.</i>

851
00:40:49,804 --> 00:40:52,677
<i>Last-minute change</i>
<i>in the program.</i>

852
00:40:52,777 --> 00:40:55,616
<i>I have to deal</i>
<i>with the last four of you.</i>

853
00:40:55,716 --> 00:40:59,356
<i>Then I'll be ready</i>
<i>for my grand opening.</i>

854
00:40:59,456 --> 00:41:08,441
<i>But this time, all of New York</i>
<i>will be my stage.</i>

855
00:41:18,261 --> 00:41:20,566
(gasps)

856
00:41:23,371 --> 00:41:25,910
(Shawn, whispering)
Have a good day, my love.

857
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:27,847
(yawns) Dad!

858
00:41:27,947 --> 00:41:29,349
Dad, how are you?

859
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:31,420
(clears throat)
I've been thinking.

860
00:41:31,521 --> 00:41:34,059
In... in... in... my sleep,
in my dreams.

861
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:36,063
Why don't you take Ember
with you today?

862
00:41:36,163 --> 00:41:37,967
- Huh?
- She'd love it.

863
00:41:38,067 --> 00:41:39,403
Look how happy she is!

864
00:41:39,504 --> 00:41:41,073
- (barks)
- Aren't you so happy, Ember?

865
00:41:41,173 --> 00:41:44,379
Oh, you're so happy!
Yes, you are. You're so happy.

866
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,385
I... I can't take her.
Who would look after you?

867
00:41:47,486 --> 00:41:50,191
Dad, stop treating me
like a baby. Don't you trust me?

868
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:52,395
- Of course I do, but...
- Then prove it.

869
00:41:52,496 --> 00:41:54,099
Take her. It'll be good
for my independence.

870
00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:56,437
Are you all right, Peanut?
Do you want me to call a doctor?

871
00:41:56,538 --> 00:41:59,076
Oh, no, no, I'm good.
(forced laugh) Huh. Hmm...

872
00:41:59,176 --> 00:42:04,386
- You'll stay home all day?
- Tsk. Just like yesterday!

873
00:42:04,486 --> 00:42:06,825
Okay, then. Ember, let's go!

874
00:42:06,925 --> 00:42:09,062
(growls)

875
00:42:09,163 --> 00:42:10,900
Bye, Ember.

876
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,603
See you later.

877
00:42:12,703 --> 00:42:15,743
Yes, I will.
Oh, yes, I will.

878
00:42:20,385 --> 00:42:22,289
- Yoo-hoo!
- Huh!

879
00:42:22,389 --> 00:42:24,594
- (laughs)
- You again?

880
00:42:24,694 --> 00:42:27,967
Argh! Do I look like a taxi cab?

881
00:42:28,067 --> 00:42:30,038
(yelling)

882
00:42:43,464 --> 00:42:46,403
(gasps)
What in the world...?

883
00:42:46,505 --> 00:42:48,174
<i>Buenos dias, Comandante.</i>

884
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:51,447
Hey, chief! We gonna nab this
no-goodnik fire ghost or what?

885
00:42:51,548 --> 00:42:54,988
Morning, Captain!
One cream, two sugars, right?

886
00:42:55,088 --> 00:42:57,627
Hmm. Yeah, that's right...

887
00:42:57,727 --> 00:42:59,664
We came in early to get
a jump-start on things.

888
00:42:59,764 --> 00:43:02,570
- Hmm.
- Oh, what a sweet doggie.

889
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:07,212
- Hello, boy. What's your name?
- It's Ember. She's a girl.

890
00:43:07,312 --> 00:43:09,551
Oh, Ember.
I'm so happy you're here.

891
00:43:09,651 --> 00:43:10,853
We're gonna have an amazing day.

892
00:43:10,953 --> 00:43:11,721
(barks)

893
00:43:11,821 --> 00:43:14,092
So that's how it's gonna be.

894
00:43:14,193 --> 00:43:15,563
(growls)

895
00:43:15,663 --> 00:43:18,735
Captain, Rick is analyzing
the fireball.

896
00:43:18,835 --> 00:43:21,006
He's trying to find out
why it didn't explode.

897
00:43:21,106 --> 00:43:24,179
Inside the ball,
there's a mixture of sulfur,

898
00:43:24,279 --> 00:43:26,450
charcoal
and potassium nitrate...

899
00:43:26,551 --> 00:43:28,555
plus a trace of nitro glycerin
and sorbents.

900
00:43:28,655 --> 00:43:29,991
Translation, please.

901
00:43:30,091 --> 00:43:31,928
(grunts)

902
00:43:32,028 --> 00:43:33,397
Gunpowder and dynamite.

903
00:43:33,497 --> 00:43:35,401
- (spits)
- Oh, hey, don't worry, Captain.

904
00:43:35,501 --> 00:43:37,607
The glass is unbreakable.

905
00:43:37,707 --> 00:43:40,278
- Oh, I see.
- And over here...

906
00:43:40,378 --> 00:43:43,317
Jin is making some amazing
improvements to the truck.

907
00:43:43,417 --> 00:43:47,727
It's Cheetah.
I already added my hanging dice
and my wooden-bead seat cover.

908
00:43:47,827 --> 00:43:49,898
So, Captain, can I drive?

909
00:43:49,998 --> 00:43:53,371
- Of course you can't drive.
- What? But I'm the best driver!

910
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,874
(snores)

911
00:43:54,974 --> 00:43:58,281
Am I the only one
who sees this as a problem?

912
00:43:58,381 --> 00:44:00,451
Jin is awfully fast
when he's awake.

913
00:44:00,553 --> 00:44:02,022
And he does know
all the quickest routes.

914
00:44:02,122 --> 00:44:05,629
Amazingly, I need a driver
who's always awake.

915
00:44:05,729 --> 00:44:09,169
- (snoring)
- So, look what we've installed.

916
00:44:09,269 --> 00:44:10,639
- (bell dinging)
- Ow!

917
00:44:10,739 --> 00:44:13,044
What? Oh, hi.
What did I miss?

918
00:44:13,144 --> 00:44:14,914
Nothing. You can drive.

919
00:44:15,014 --> 00:44:16,952
Skiddle-dee-do!

920
00:44:17,052 --> 00:44:18,655
The Cheetah is back!

921
00:44:18,755 --> 00:44:22,295
Captain Neil delivered all
the evidence compiled so far.

922
00:44:22,395 --> 00:44:26,470
Photos, samples,
even audio recordings.

923
00:44:26,571 --> 00:44:29,276
There's only the one theater
left on Broadway.

924
00:44:29,376 --> 00:44:30,813
<i>The mystery is,</i>

925
00:44:30,913 --> 00:44:32,817
<i>how does the arsonist</i>
<i>get into the theaters</i>

926
00:44:32,917 --> 00:44:34,621
<i>when there are</i>
<i>police everywhere?</i>

927
00:44:34,721 --> 00:44:38,394
Isn't it obvious?
He's a ghost!

928
00:44:38,494 --> 00:44:39,496
Huh? A ghost?

929
00:44:39,597 --> 00:44:41,200
Aah! Oh...

930
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:44,574
(scoffs) Can you drop
the silly ghost theory, Jin?

931
00:44:44,674 --> 00:44:46,911
Okay. Let me try.
Nope, I can't. It's too good.

932
00:44:47,012 --> 00:44:50,552
Enough! We only have one more
chance to catch the arsonist.

933
00:44:50,653 --> 00:44:52,489
- Ricardo?
- Hmm?

934
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:54,326
You take a shower.

935
00:44:54,426 --> 00:44:56,063
And then keep analyzing
that fireball.

936
00:44:56,163 --> 00:44:57,465
Okay, Comandante.

937
00:44:57,566 --> 00:45:00,004
Jin turn this truck
into a rocket.

938
00:45:00,104 --> 00:45:01,373
Done and done, Captain.

939
00:45:01,473 --> 00:45:02,843
- Good briefing, Joe.
- Thank you.

940
00:45:02,943 --> 00:45:05,916
You come with me.
I'm gonna train you.

941
00:45:06,016 --> 00:45:08,622
(humming happily)

942
00:45:15,769 --> 00:45:18,709
Welcome to the fire
simulation room.

943
00:45:18,809 --> 00:45:21,715
Ooh... It's really hot.
(small cough)

944
00:45:21,815 --> 00:45:24,386
(Shawn) Temperatures can reach
2,000 degrees.

945
00:45:24,486 --> 00:45:27,927
Relax. Get to know
your worst enemy.

946
00:45:28,027 --> 00:45:29,697
He is fierce...

947
00:45:29,797 --> 00:45:31,634
- Oh!
- Powerful.

948
00:45:31,735 --> 00:45:33,204
Hey! Where you going?

949
00:45:33,304 --> 00:45:36,611
Okay. I can do this. Give it to
me. What have you got?

950
00:45:36,711 --> 00:45:38,782
- I can do this.
- Okay. Okay, Joe, relax.

951
00:45:38,882 --> 00:45:41,320
I know you're strong
and in excellent condition,

952
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:43,457
but technique... Wait, wait!

953
00:45:47,098 --> 00:45:48,602
That was a back draft.

954
00:45:48,702 --> 00:45:51,741
I told you, don't run.
Walk with purpose.

955
00:45:51,841 --> 00:45:56,417
But firemen have to be...
fast and brave.

956
00:45:56,518 --> 00:45:57,620
(grunts)

957
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,058
You take recklessness
for bravery.

958
00:46:00,158 --> 00:46:01,995
(panting)

959
00:46:02,095 --> 00:46:03,297
(lively jazz music)

960
00:46:03,397 --> 00:46:05,268
- Aaah! Oh!
- Reckless.

961
00:46:05,368 --> 00:46:08,508
You didn't analyze the situation
or assess the risk.

962
00:46:08,608 --> 00:46:11,146
That's not bravery,
it's just stupid.

963
00:46:11,246 --> 00:46:13,885
Um, I think I get it.
Can you pull me up now?

964
00:46:13,985 --> 00:46:16,658
I'll think about it
a little longer.

965
00:46:16,758 --> 00:46:21,467
Captain... Captain,
that's not funny. Come on...

966
00:46:21,568 --> 00:46:23,270
Captain!

967
00:46:24,607 --> 00:46:26,143
(Shawn) Very impressive, Joe.

968
00:46:26,243 --> 00:46:28,347
- You're a fast learner.
- Oh, thank you, Captain.

969
00:46:28,447 --> 00:46:29,851
That means so much
coming from you.

970
00:46:29,951 --> 00:46:31,621
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Don't get distracted.

971
00:46:31,721 --> 00:46:33,658
- You keep the nozzle turning.
- Yeah, yeah!

972
00:46:33,759 --> 00:46:36,664
Of course, Captain.
Sorry, Captain.

973
00:46:36,765 --> 00:46:39,737
It's funny,
you remind me of my daughter.

974
00:46:39,837 --> 00:46:41,608
- Huh?
- She's about your age.

975
00:46:41,708 --> 00:46:43,812
Really? Yeah, that is funny.
(forced chuckle)

976
00:46:43,912 --> 00:46:46,083
Hmm. Yeah, she wanted
to be a fireman too.

977
00:46:46,183 --> 00:46:48,822
But you don't think girls
should be firemen?

978
00:46:48,922 --> 00:46:50,859
No, of course
they should be firemen.

979
00:46:50,959 --> 00:46:53,364
So why didn't you teach her
what you're teaching me?

980
00:46:53,464 --> 00:46:55,803
- It's complicated.
- Why, because she's a girl?

981
00:46:55,903 --> 00:46:57,640
No, because she's my daughter.

982
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:00,512
I mean, I love her
and I worry about her
every second of my life.

983
00:47:00,612 --> 00:47:04,119
- Aw.
- And I have to protect her.

984
00:47:04,219 --> 00:47:06,624
I mean, she's lots of attention,
she's delicate,

985
00:47:06,724 --> 00:47:08,929
she's sensitive,
the world freaks her out...

986
00:47:09,029 --> 00:47:10,699
Aaaah!

987
00:47:10,799 --> 00:47:13,003
Hey! What the heck was that?

988
00:47:13,104 --> 00:47:14,139
Sorry, Captain.

989
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:17,412
Yeah, you'll see
how fragile I am.

990
00:47:17,513 --> 00:47:19,784
(sirens wailing)

991
00:47:19,884 --> 00:47:22,757
It's the Lyceum,
Laura Divine's theater.

992
00:47:22,857 --> 00:47:24,594
- Hurry, Jin!
- The Cheetah's on it!

993
00:47:24,694 --> 00:47:26,463
- (snores)
- Hoh! Hoh! Wake up, Jin!

994
00:47:26,564 --> 00:47:28,134
(Georgia) On it!

995
00:47:28,234 --> 00:47:30,706
Hey! Easy on the ol'
pie hole there.

996
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:32,175
Well, that works...

997
00:47:32,275 --> 00:47:33,310
Ricardo, how's it going?

998
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:35,114
<i>Are you getting any closer?</i>

999
00:47:35,214 --> 00:47:37,051
Hold on.

1000
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,528
(muffled) Can I call you later?

1001
00:47:41,628 --> 00:47:42,596
(alarm ringing)

1002
00:47:42,696 --> 00:47:44,099
(Divine) Pauline, turn that off!

1003
00:47:44,199 --> 00:47:46,571
(Pauline) Right away,
Miss Divine!

1004
00:47:46,671 --> 00:47:49,577
(Divine) Okay. From the top!

1005
00:47:49,677 --> 00:47:52,148
(cabaret-style music)

1006
00:47:52,248 --> 00:47:54,987
<i>♪ Baby, look at me ♪</i>

1007
00:47:55,087 --> 00:47:56,991
<i>♪ And tell me what you see... ♪</i>

1008
00:47:57,091 --> 00:48:00,799
All that smoke on stage
must have tripped the alarm.

1009
00:48:00,899 --> 00:48:02,703
I thought you shut
all the theaters, Captain Neil.

1010
00:48:02,803 --> 00:48:06,109
We did! We've kicked
Miss Divine out four times!

1011
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:08,648
And this is the fifth time
she's come back.

1012

1018
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:24,780
I have replicas of every tiara
she's worn

1019
00:48:24,881 --> 00:48:28,087
since she took Broadway by storm
20 years ago, mm-hm!

1020
00:48:28,187 --> 00:48:30,091
The star is never
out of the spotlight!

1021
00:48:30,191 --> 00:48:33,464
You think I like hanging here
like a side of beef?

1022
00:48:33,565 --> 00:48:36,571
- Reset me!
- Yes, Miss Divine!

1023
00:48:36,671 --> 00:48:38,808
Right away, Miss Divine!

1024
00:48:38,909 --> 00:48:41,814
Joe, go talk to that poor lady
working the ropes

1025
00:48:41,915 --> 00:48:43,184
and see if she has
any information.

1026
00:48:43,284 --> 00:48:45,154
- Hmm.
- I'll take the drama queen.

1027
00:48:45,254 --> 00:48:47,793
- Oh! Where are we going?
- I meant Miss Divine.

1028
00:48:47,893 --> 00:48:50,398
Ahem! Of course. Hmm!

1029
00:48:52,636 --> 00:48:55,041
<i>♪ Baby, look at me ♪</i>

1030
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:57,613

Whoa!

1031
00:48:57,713 --> 00:49:00,552
Ms. Divine!
Captain Nolan from the FDNY.

1032
00:49:00,652 --> 00:49:03,357
- May I have a word?
- Lights!

1033
00:49:03,457 --> 00:49:05,562
Talk fast or there's a chance

1034
00:49:05,662 --> 00:49:08,568
I may lose
my signature good humor.

1035
00:49:08,668 --> 00:49:10,672
The police evacuated
your theater

1036
00:49:10,772 --> 00:49:12,208
for your own safety,
Miss Divine.

1037
00:49:12,308 --> 00:49:14,079
Huge fan!

1038
00:49:14,179 --> 00:49:16,149
(Shawn groans)

1039
00:49:17,151 --> 00:49:19,055
There is a very good chance

1040
00:49:19,155 --> 00:49:21,561
that this theater will go up
in smoke like all the others.

1041
00:49:21,661 --> 00:49:23,364
My premiere is in three days.

1042
00:49:23,464 --> 00:49:25,969
Have you ever heard
what the show must do?

1043
00:49:26,069 --> 00:49:27,640
- (soft chuckle)
- Umm... Go on?

1044
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:28,975
That's right!

1045
00:49:29,075 --> 00:49:30,746
I don't know
who you think you are

1046
00:49:30,846 --> 00:49:32,115
or where you come from, but...

1047
00:49:32,215 --> 00:49:33,284
- Ahem!
- Oh!

1048
00:49:33,384 --> 00:49:35,522
So, Pauline, is it?

1049
00:49:35,622 --> 00:49:37,927
- You work for Miss Divine?
- Yes.

1050
00:49:38,027 --> 00:49:40,498
Her personal assistant
for two months now,

1051
00:49:40,599 --> 00:49:42,570
but I've been kicking around
Broadway for 20 years.

1052
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:43,838
Uh-huh.

1053
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:45,842
Just don't have much
to show for it.

1054
00:49:45,943 --> 00:49:49,784
Anyway, you must be part
of the mayor's heroic fire team.

1055
00:49:49,884 --> 00:49:51,554
That's right. I'm Joe.

1056
00:49:51,654 --> 00:49:54,392
Oh, I saw your photo
in the paper.

1057
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:56,931
I never forget a handsome face.

1058
00:49:57,031 --> 00:49:59,537
(laughs) No, no... Ahem.

1059
00:49:59,637 --> 00:50:00,839
Oh.

1060
00:50:00,939 --> 00:50:03,377
Oh... Uh, thank you.

1061
00:50:03,477 --> 00:50:05,248
I'm so glad you're here, Joe.

1062
00:50:05,348 --> 00:50:06,818
I'm a little jittery.

1063
00:50:06,918 --> 00:50:09,089
Actually, very.

1064
00:50:09,189 --> 00:50:11,594
But nothing scares Miss Divine.

1065
00:50:11,694 --> 00:50:13,832
Say it!
Unless I'm the arsonist?

1066
00:50:13,932 --> 00:50:18,541
Uh, well, I'm just doing my job,
Miss Divine,
covering all my bases.

1067
00:50:18,642 --> 00:50:20,378
I grew up cleaning houses

1068
00:50:20,478 --> 00:50:23,183
and babysitting for rich people
who told me:

1069
00:50:23,284 --> 00:50:26,290
"Now, don't you kiss the baby,
Miss Laura."

1070
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:28,962
"Don't you eat off the china,
Miss Laura."

1071
00:50:29,062 --> 00:50:30,832
I saved every penny I earned

1072
00:50:30,932 --> 00:50:33,404
so I could get out of there
and come to Broadway.

1073
00:50:33,505 --> 00:50:35,308
- And when a dancer quit...
- (gasps)

1074
00:50:35,408 --> 00:50:38,748
...guess who was ready
to step in and save the day?

1075
00:50:38,848 --> 00:50:40,953
- You were.
- Yes.

1076
00:50:41,053 --> 00:50:44,627
Now, respectfully,
get the heck out of my theater.

1077
00:50:44,727 --> 00:50:46,631
Pull me back up, Pauline!

1078
00:50:46,731 --> 00:50:50,004
Right away, Miss Divine!
(grunts)

1079
00:50:50,104 --> 00:50:53,645
Miss Divine, I can't let you
continue to rehearse.

1080
00:50:53,745 --> 00:50:55,348
You gotta come with me.

1081
00:50:55,448 --> 00:50:56,751
Would you say something?

1082
00:50:56,851 --> 00:50:59,322
Will you sign my face?

1083
00:50:59,422 --> 00:51:00,759
Not that!

1084
00:51:00,859 --> 00:51:03,798
I wanna fly! Yes!

1085
00:51:04,332 --> 00:51:06,504
Yes! Higher!

1086
00:51:06,604 --> 00:51:08,173
Yes, Miss Divine!

1087
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:09,677
I wanna fly!

1088
00:51:09,777 --> 00:51:10,779
(grunts)

1089
00:51:10,879 --> 00:51:12,148
Higher!

1090
00:51:12,248 --> 00:51:14,520
- (clicking)
- (Pauline) Whoa!

1091
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:17,425
(screams)

1092
00:51:20,632 --> 00:51:22,435
Pauline!

1093
00:51:22,536 --> 00:51:23,705
(shouts)

1094
00:51:23,805 --> 00:51:28,447
You just clipped
the wings of an angel!

1095
00:51:28,548 --> 00:51:30,519
(sobs)

1096
00:51:30,619 --> 00:51:33,057
Oh... I feel like a failure
in my life.

1097
00:51:33,157 --> 00:51:34,927
There's nothing I can do.

1098
00:51:35,027 --> 00:51:37,498
Oh, Pauline,
please don't worry.

1099
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,637
I'm... I'm pretty sure
she's gonna recover.

1100
00:51:39,737 --> 00:51:41,406
(Divine) Get me
out of here right now!

1101
00:51:41,507 --> 00:51:44,479
Miss Divine, there is
no need to get upset.

1102
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:46,316
Everything is gonna be fine.

1103
00:51:46,416 --> 00:51:48,521
(whispering) Where's the crane?
Don't worry, Miss Divine!

1104
00:51:48,621 --> 00:51:49,824
Get me the crane.

1105
00:51:49,924 --> 00:51:52,996
See?
Sounds like she'll recover.

1106
00:51:53,097 --> 00:51:56,236
- I mess everything up.
- Don't be so hard on yourself.

1107
00:51:56,336 --> 00:51:59,610
Maybe this is a sign
that it's time
you follow your own dreams.

1108
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:01,948
I never gave up on mine.

1109
00:52:02,048 --> 00:52:04,820
Easy for you to say.
You're a man.

1110
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,158
Not really.

1111
00:52:07,926 --> 00:52:09,830
(whispering) I'm all girl.

1112
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:11,734
My name is Georgia.

1113
00:52:11,834 --> 00:52:13,671
Georgia?

1114
00:52:13,772 --> 00:52:15,942
What an amazing costume.

1115
00:52:16,042 --> 00:52:17,980
The mustache is very convincing.

1116
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,585
It's my dog's butt hair.
It was the only way.

1117
00:52:20,685 --> 00:52:23,825
If I catch the arsonist, they'll
have to change the rules.

1118
00:52:23,925 --> 00:52:25,729
Then I'll be
the first fireman woman.

1119
00:52:25,829 --> 00:52:29,837
Oh...
The first... firefighter.

1120
00:52:29,937 --> 00:52:31,808
Firefighter.

1121
00:52:31,908 --> 00:52:34,179
Yeah! I love that.

1122
00:52:34,279 --> 00:52:37,452
- You're very inspiring.
- Hmm.

1123
00:52:37,553 --> 00:52:40,124
(humming)

1124
00:52:44,399 --> 00:52:45,869
(sighs)

1125
00:52:45,969 --> 00:52:49,409
It's not the first time
you've seen him here?

1126
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:50,946
No.

1127
00:52:51,046 --> 00:52:53,818
He's always sneaking around.

1128
00:52:53,918 --> 00:52:56,557
Hmm. Okay.

1129
00:52:57,225 --> 00:52:59,930
Psst! Be careful...

1130
00:53:00,699 --> 00:53:02,368
Joe.

1131
00:53:03,437 --> 00:53:06,176
(humming)

1132
00:53:09,917 --> 00:53:12,689
(humming)

1133
00:53:21,941 --> 00:53:24,379
(panting)

1134
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:30,157
Hmmm.

1135
00:53:30,257 --> 00:53:32,462
(plays simple melody)

1136
00:53:32,563 --> 00:53:36,136
(dramatic organ music)

1137
00:53:36,771 --> 00:53:39,008
The music...

1138
00:53:39,108 --> 00:53:41,112
- Aah!
- (coughing)

1139
00:53:41,213 --> 00:53:43,585
I'm so sorry, Captain.
Are you okay?

1140
00:53:43,685 --> 00:53:45,020
I'm really, really sorry,

1141
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,958
but we have to go back
to the firehouse, okay?

1142
00:53:47,058 --> 00:53:48,795
- Can you breathe?
- (coughs)

1143
00:53:48,895 --> 00:53:50,765
I hope you have
a good explanation.

1144
00:53:50,866 --> 00:53:54,573
I do. I really do. I am so sorry
for your... for your throat.

1145
00:53:58,982 --> 00:54:01,186
Experiment number 26:

1146
00:54:01,286 --> 00:54:04,492
integrating the music recorded
at the scene of the fires.

1147
00:54:05,529 --> 00:54:06,731
Here we go.

1148
00:54:06,831 --> 00:54:10,004
(music starts)

1149
00:54:10,104 --> 00:54:11,641
Oh, you were right, Joe.

1150
00:54:11,741 --> 00:54:14,112
The music,
it activates the fireball.

1151
00:54:14,212 --> 00:54:15,481
Jiminy cricket!

1152
00:54:15,582 --> 00:54:18,120
(Ricardo) Oh...
I've never seen a material

1153
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:20,625
create light
in reaction to sound.

1154
00:54:20,725 --> 00:54:23,363
- The work of a true artist.
- Or a ghost...

1155
00:54:23,463 --> 00:54:25,301
- Bu-bu-bu-bu-bu.
- Mm-hm?

1156
00:54:25,401 --> 00:54:27,438
- From the future.
- (sighs)

1157
00:54:27,539 --> 00:54:30,712
No, no, no. Ember.
Ember, come back. Sit here.

1158
00:54:30,812 --> 00:54:33,952
- Sit here with me.
- Approaching 90 seconds.

1159
00:54:34,052 --> 00:54:35,555
(clinking)

1160
00:54:35,655 --> 00:54:37,325
(all) Oh! Oh! Oh!

1161
00:54:37,425 --> 00:54:41,499
Ember! Ember? Captain, Jin,
get down, get down!

1162
00:54:41,601 --> 00:54:43,036
What's going on?
What's happening?

1163
00:54:43,136 --> 00:54:44,439
The light has hypnotized them!

1164
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:47,311
The last five notes
cause the explosion!

1165
00:54:47,411 --> 00:54:50,652
- (Ricardo) I cannot move.
- Rick! Rick, it's spreading.

1166
00:54:50,752 --> 00:54:52,355
We have to get them
out of here right now!

1167
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:54,560
I cannot move.
I cannot move!

1168
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:57,265
Hey, it's okay. It's okay
to be scared. I'm scared too.

1169
00:54:57,365 --> 00:55:00,304
But you can still be brave.
Rick. Rick, look at me.

1170
00:55:00,404 --> 00:55:03,511
Go in together, stay together,
come out together.

1171
00:55:03,611 --> 00:55:05,147
Come on!

1172
00:55:06,182 --> 00:55:09,322
Okay. Okay.

1173
00:55:14,299 --> 00:55:17,606
Oh, wow. I didn't expect that.

1174
00:55:21,547 --> 00:55:23,785
(yelling)

1175
00:55:31,968 --> 00:55:34,573
(panting)

1176
00:55:34,673 --> 00:55:36,844
Oh, I did it. I did it!

1177
00:55:36,944 --> 00:55:39,215
Yes, I did it!

1178
00:55:40,317 --> 00:55:43,390
Looks like the training
paid off, Dad.

1179
00:55:45,361 --> 00:55:48,200
Captain Neil, we know
how to stop the arsonist.

1180
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,337
I repeat, we know
how to stop the arsonist.

1181
00:55:50,437 --> 00:55:52,208
<i>(Neil) Oh! That's fabulous.</i>

1182
00:55:52,308 --> 00:55:54,412
We are on our way
to Laura Divine's theater.

1183
00:55:54,513 --> 00:55:56,951
But Captain Nolan wants you
to evacuate all of Midtown.

1184
00:55:57,051 --> 00:55:58,888
<i>(Neil) I'm all over it!</i>

1185
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:01,527
Guys, I'm sorry
I was hard on you.

1186
00:56:01,627 --> 00:56:05,602
I expected nothing, and at first
that's exactly what I got.

1187
00:56:05,702 --> 00:56:08,206
But this turned out to be
a pretty darn good crew.

1188
00:56:08,307 --> 00:56:10,077
Ricardo, you saved us in there.

1189
00:56:10,177 --> 00:56:11,514
Thank you, Captain.

1190
00:56:11,614 --> 00:56:14,520
But perhaps this bravery
was always inside of me,

1191
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:16,089
and it was Joe
who revealed it with...

1192
00:56:16,189 --> 00:56:18,360
(vomiting)

1193
00:56:20,064 --> 00:56:23,270
Big truck... sick.
I... sorry.

1194
00:56:23,370 --> 00:56:25,174
- I'm better now.
- Ugh.

1195
00:56:25,274 --> 00:56:28,413
And you too.
Amazing work, Joe.

1196
00:56:29,349 --> 00:56:30,484
Thank you.

1197
00:56:30,585 --> 00:56:32,656
(siren wailing)

1198
00:56:40,505 --> 00:56:43,343
Captain Nolan.
Good to have you here.

1199
00:56:43,443 --> 00:56:45,649
We'll have the perimeter
secured in a quick 10 minutes.

1200
00:56:45,749 --> 00:56:48,220
We have everything
under control.

1201
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:51,192
Thank you, Captain Neil.
I'll get my men in position too.

1202
00:56:51,292 --> 00:56:53,698
- Are you ready?
- (all) Yes, Captain!

1203
00:56:59,777 --> 00:57:03,518
Okay, team, I want 10 lines,
inch and three quarters.

1204
00:57:03,618 --> 00:57:05,655
Open all the nozzles
in the auditorium

1205
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:07,391
and lock them
between the seats.

1206
00:57:07,491 --> 00:57:09,462
I want all of them
targeting the stage.

1207
00:57:09,563 --> 00:57:12,034
As soon as the alarm starts,
we turn on the water

1208
00:57:12,134 --> 00:57:14,405
and we drown that arsonist.

1209
00:57:16,677 --> 00:57:18,648
- Great job team.
- Thank you.

1210
00:57:18,748 --> 00:57:20,050
Yeah! (laughs)

1211
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:21,119
(Shawn) Hey, Captain Neil.

1212
00:57:21,219 --> 00:57:23,457
Georgia!
Oh, sorry!

1213
00:57:23,558 --> 00:57:24,526
Joe!

1214
00:57:24,626 --> 00:57:26,664
Pauline!

1215
00:57:26,764 --> 00:57:28,968
- Where you going?
- I got fired.

1216
00:57:29,068 --> 00:57:30,739
But I'm happy!

1217
00:57:30,839 --> 00:57:33,745
You were absolutely right.
It's time for a change.

1218
00:57:33,845 --> 00:57:36,584
- Time for me to shine.
- Well, I'm happy for you.

1219
00:57:36,684 --> 00:57:37,986
Good luck.

1220
00:57:38,086 --> 00:57:39,890
You too, Georgia.

1221
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:42,128
Well, then, this is goodbye.

1222
00:57:42,228 --> 00:57:45,267
I just need to fetch my lucky
slippers and then I'm off.

1223
00:57:45,367 --> 00:57:47,371
I'm done with New York.

1224
00:57:47,471 --> 00:57:49,475
Okay. Well, hurry.

1225
00:57:49,576 --> 00:57:51,547
The police are shutting down
all of Midtown.

1226
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:55,154
(pickle guy mutters)

1227
00:57:55,254 --> 00:57:57,124
(officer)
Everybody move back.

1228
00:57:57,224 --> 00:57:59,362
Hey, you, pickle guy!
Get outta here!

1229
00:57:59,462 --> 00:58:01,266
Oh yeah, sure.
I understand. I understand.

1230
00:58:01,366 --> 00:58:03,336
- Oh...
- Don't boss me around!

1231
00:58:03,437 --> 00:58:05,140
- Hmm...
- (alarm ringing)

1232
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,244
He's here. Turn on the water.

1233
00:58:07,344 --> 00:58:09,583
Darn it! We've been tricked!

1234
00:58:09,683 --> 00:58:12,188
The fire isn't coming
from the auditorium this time!

1235
00:58:12,288 --> 00:58:14,125
- Where is it?
- Everywhere!

1236
00:58:14,225 --> 00:58:15,895
It's a trap! Abort!

1237
00:58:15,995 --> 00:58:18,868
But Pauline just went inside!
I have to save her!

1238
00:58:18,968 --> 00:58:20,037
(sighs)

1239
00:58:20,137 --> 00:58:22,976
Get ready! We're going in!

1240
00:58:25,247 --> 00:58:27,753
(ladder rattles)

1241
00:58:34,833 --> 00:58:36,269
(coughing) Come on!

1242
00:58:36,369 --> 00:58:38,173
Pauline!
Where'd she go?

1243
00:58:38,273 --> 00:58:40,410
Pauline!
Can you see her?

1244
00:58:40,512 --> 00:58:42,849
- (coughs)
- You go right, I'll go left!

1245
00:58:42,949 --> 00:58:46,122
And use your hose so you don't
get lost in the smoke.

1246
00:58:46,222 --> 00:58:48,528
Okay, Captain.

1247
00:58:53,771 --> 00:58:54,840
Pauline!

1248
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:57,011
(coughs)
Pauline!

1249
00:58:57,111 --> 00:58:58,380
Pauline!

1250
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,952
- (panting)
- Pauline, I've got you.

1251
00:59:01,052 --> 00:59:02,756
(grunts)

1252
00:59:02,856 --> 00:59:06,362
- I thought I would perish.
- (coughs)

1253
00:59:07,666 --> 00:59:09,302
- Aaah!
- Pauline!

1254
00:59:09,402 --> 00:59:12,241
Save me! Save me!

1255
00:59:12,341 --> 00:59:15,481
- Pauline!
- Don't let go!

1256
00:59:15,582 --> 00:59:20,792
Georgia! Georgia, I can't...
Georgia!

1257
00:59:21,927 --> 00:59:24,398
Pauline!
(grunts)

1258
00:59:24,499 --> 00:59:26,637
- Stop!
- But Pauline's down there!

1259
00:59:26,737 --> 00:59:28,708
- She might still be alive!
- It's too late.

1260
00:59:28,808 --> 00:59:30,545
No, I can't risk
losing you both.

1261
00:59:30,645 --> 00:59:33,116
We have to get out.
That is an order!

1262
00:59:33,216 --> 00:59:34,920
Come on!

1263
00:59:36,991 --> 00:59:38,828
Come on!

1264
00:59:51,352 --> 00:59:53,056
(sighs)

1265
00:59:54,392 --> 00:59:56,830
(Ember whimpers softly)

1266
01:00:00,572 --> 01:00:03,844
I wanted to be a fireman
to save people.

1267
01:00:05,882 --> 01:00:11,025
Sixteen years ago, just after
I'd been made captain,

1268
01:00:11,125 --> 01:00:12,261
there was a terrible house fire

1269
01:00:12,361 --> 01:00:14,432
with a young couple
trapped inside.

1270
01:00:15,535 --> 01:00:17,271
When we got there,
we hacked at the walls,

1271
01:00:17,371 --> 01:00:19,910
trying to get them out,
but it was too late.

1272
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:21,547
I couldn't save them.

1273
01:00:21,647 --> 01:00:26,256
I didn't know how I could go on.
I was devastated.

1274
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:27,893
And I needed to...

1275
01:00:27,993 --> 01:00:30,598
I needed to be there
for my daughter.

1276
01:00:31,567 --> 01:00:34,573
She was so little then and I...

1277
01:00:34,673 --> 01:00:38,380
Anyway, my battalion chief
told me that if I...

1278
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,450
wanted to be a real fireman,

1279
01:00:40,552 --> 01:00:43,925
I'd have to accept that
sometimes bad things happen

1280
01:00:44,025 --> 01:00:46,864
and there's nothing more
you could do.

1281
01:00:46,964 --> 01:00:49,435
You have to let it go.

1282
01:00:50,337 --> 01:00:52,207
Shawn!

1283
01:00:52,308 --> 01:00:54,278
Congratulations!

1284
01:00:54,378 --> 01:00:56,584
- For what?
- The auditorium!

1285
01:00:56,684 --> 01:01:00,424
- It's saved!
- We lost someone, Jimmy.

1286
01:01:00,525 --> 01:01:02,027
And the arsonist
is still on the loose.

1287
01:01:02,127 --> 01:01:05,167
Oh, I know, I know.
Terrible, terrible.

1288
01:01:05,267 --> 01:01:07,304
I gotta do something.
You know what I'm gonna do?

1289
01:01:07,404 --> 01:01:11,012
I'm gonna put the police.
The police are taking over.

1290
01:01:11,112 --> 01:01:14,085
What? No!
I have to stop the arsonist.

1291
01:01:14,185 --> 01:01:15,655
Jimmy, don't do this.

1292
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:17,258
We still don't know
where the firemen are.

1293
01:01:17,358 --> 01:01:19,763
- Hey!
- The police will find them.

1294
01:01:19,863 --> 01:01:22,101
As for the arsonist, he doesn't
have any more theaters to burn.

1295
01:01:22,201 --> 01:01:25,742
He's finished. And I have places
to go and people to see.

1296
01:01:25,842 --> 01:01:30,050
So, Shawnie, get some rest,
and thanks for the great show.

1297
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:31,587
Show?

1298
01:01:31,687 --> 01:01:34,826
Oh, by the way,
I've been re-elected!

1299
01:01:34,926 --> 01:01:38,233
<i>♪ Four more years</i>
<i>Four more years... ♪</i>

1300
01:01:38,333 --> 01:01:41,272
- I know he's your friend...
- Yeah, whatever.

1301
01:01:41,372 --> 01:01:43,978
We stick to him
like white on rice.

1302
01:01:44,078 --> 01:01:45,815
Like stink on diapers.

1303
01:01:45,915 --> 01:01:47,552
- Hmm.
- Too much, right?

1304
01:01:47,652 --> 01:01:49,523
Yeah, too much.

1305
01:01:53,631 --> 01:01:55,802
(soft jazz music)

1306
01:01:58,039 --> 01:01:59,810
(teeth chatter)

1307
01:01:59,910 --> 01:02:00,912
Hmm.

1308
01:02:01,012 --> 01:02:05,320
- (teeth chatter)
- Shhh! Hmm.

1309
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:08,026
(whispering)
Three, two, one...

1310
01:02:09,328 --> 01:02:11,299
(grunting)

1311
01:02:11,399 --> 01:02:13,971
- Hmm?
- (groaning)

1312
01:02:15,842 --> 01:02:19,482
- Don't.
- No, I got this, I got this.

1313
01:02:21,954 --> 01:02:24,091
Okay, get out of the way, son.

1314
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,966
- (grunting)
- No, no! No!

1315
01:02:28,066 --> 01:02:30,705
(grunting)

1316
01:02:31,807 --> 01:02:35,147
(distorted yelling)

1317
01:02:35,247 --> 01:02:37,451
(yells)

1318
01:02:37,552 --> 01:02:39,388
(distorted yelling)

1319
01:02:39,488 --> 01:02:41,192
(distorted yell)

1320
01:02:41,292 --> 01:02:43,063
(distorted barking)

1321
01:02:43,163 --> 01:02:45,033
(distorted yelling)

1322
01:02:45,133 --> 01:02:46,670
Aaah!

1323
01:02:46,770 --> 01:02:48,306
- Dad!
- Dad?

1324
01:02:48,406 --> 01:02:50,444
- Cupcake!
- Cupcake?

1325
01:02:50,545 --> 01:02:53,651
(both yelling)

1326
01:02:53,751 --> 01:02:55,822
- Get it open!
- There's no handle!

1327
01:02:55,922 --> 01:02:59,261
Get it open!
Get it open. Get it open.

1328
01:03:00,732 --> 01:03:03,036
Good job, Ember.

1329
01:03:04,438 --> 01:03:06,275
(echoing) Cupcake?

1330
01:03:06,376 --> 01:03:07,779
(Divine muttering)

1331
01:03:07,879 --> 01:03:09,983
At least she hasn't lost
her voice.

1332
01:03:10,083 --> 01:03:11,620
Jokes, huh?

1333
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:13,557
We'll see how hard you laugh

1334
01:03:13,657 --> 01:03:16,062
when you're scrubbing toilets
at Yankee Stadium.

1335
01:03:16,162 --> 01:03:19,101
(Divine yelling)

1336
01:03:19,201 --> 01:03:21,072
Cupcake, look at you!

1337
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:24,746
- (grunting)
- Look at you, my cupcake.

1338
01:03:24,846 --> 01:03:26,482
What are you trying to do
to my fiancée?

1339
01:03:26,583 --> 01:03:31,225
Fiancée? I think there's been
a terrible misunderstanding.

1340
01:03:31,325 --> 01:03:34,331
We, uh, we... we kind of thought
you were the arsonist.

1341
01:03:34,432 --> 01:03:36,069
The arsonist? Me?

1342
01:03:36,169 --> 01:03:38,908
It's just you were always
sneaking around the theater.

1343
01:03:39,008 --> 01:03:42,816
Only because I love this woman
and we can't be seen together.

1344
01:03:42,916 --> 01:03:45,521
Oh, yeah, of course,
I totally understand.

1345
01:03:45,621 --> 01:03:47,792
- Society has to change.
- No, no, no, not that.

1346
01:03:47,892 --> 01:03:49,796
She doesn't wanna
be seen with me.

1347
01:03:49,896 --> 01:03:51,900
Of course I don't wanna
be seen with him!

1348
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,004
It's bad for my reputation
to be seen

1349
01:03:54,105 --> 01:03:56,142
with a sleazy
double-dealing scoundrel.

1350
01:03:56,242 --> 01:03:58,681
But I'm your sleazy
double-dealing scoundrel.

1351
01:03:58,781 --> 01:04:02,756
- (barks)
- Oh, cupcake.

1352
01:04:04,425 --> 01:04:06,095
Captain! Look!

1353
01:04:06,195 --> 01:04:08,534
The firemen must be
down here somewhere.

1354
01:04:08,634 --> 01:04:10,237
(Jin) Hey, Cap,
everything alright?

1355
01:04:10,337 --> 01:04:12,474
Jin! Get down here
and help Jimmy and Laura!

1356
01:04:12,575 --> 01:04:15,247
Call Captain Neil.
We found something.

1357
01:04:15,347 --> 01:04:18,186
Sorry, Jimmy, but we have to go
search this subway tunnel.

1358
01:04:18,286 --> 01:04:21,727
Congratulations. She'll make a
charming first lady of New York.

1359
01:04:21,827 --> 01:04:24,666
When she's back in one piece.

1360
01:04:24,766 --> 01:04:27,539
Out of my sight!

1361
01:04:27,639 --> 01:04:30,243
(Divine) Aaah! My arm!
Oh! Oh, it hurts.

1362
01:04:30,343 --> 01:04:32,749
(Georgia) Hey, hey, Captain,
where are we?

1363
01:04:32,849 --> 01:04:36,155
(Shawn) The track
for the BMT train.

1364
01:04:39,128 --> 01:04:40,631
Okay. Okay.

1365
01:04:40,731 --> 01:04:43,303
- Which way, Ember?
- (sniffing)

1366
01:04:43,403 --> 01:04:45,006
(barks)

1367
01:04:45,106 --> 01:04:46,743
Go! Go!

1368
01:04:50,016 --> 01:04:51,854
(barks)

1369
01:05:01,974 --> 01:05:03,243
Joe...

1370
01:05:03,343 --> 01:05:07,919
I think we just found
the lair of the arsonist.

1371
01:05:10,423 --> 01:05:12,027
(Georgia) What is this place?

1372
01:05:12,127 --> 01:05:15,835
(Shawn) It's an air
distribution chamber.

1373
01:05:15,935 --> 01:05:18,306
This must be
where he rehearsed his show.

1374
01:05:28,193 --> 01:05:30,698
(Ember whining)

1375
01:05:30,798 --> 01:05:33,571
It's hooked up to the fan
like a turbine.

1376
01:05:33,671 --> 01:05:35,373
Must take a crazy
amount of energy

1377
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:37,211
to create those fireballs.

1378
01:05:37,311 --> 01:05:39,315
Hmm.

1379
01:05:43,924 --> 01:05:45,360
- Captain, come here!
- Huh?

1380
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:48,767
Rejection letters.
From every theater on Broadway.

1381
01:05:48,868 --> 01:05:51,673
"You belong in a loony bin,
not a theater."

1382
01:05:51,773 --> 01:05:54,345
Yeah... PhD in chemistry.

1383
01:05:54,445 --> 01:05:57,685
The scientist is a failed artist
who's looking for revenge.

1384
01:05:57,785 --> 01:05:59,823
(gasps)

1385
01:06:00,725 --> 01:06:02,194
Broadway was just the rehearsal.

1386
01:06:02,294 --> 01:06:04,265
The real performance
is happening tonight.

1387
01:06:04,365 --> 01:06:06,870
From the top
of the Chrysler Building.

1388
01:06:06,970 --> 01:06:09,441
(whimpers, barks)

1389
01:06:11,212 --> 01:06:12,815
What?

1390
01:06:20,096 --> 01:06:21,967
Hey! I think we found them!

1391
01:06:22,067 --> 01:06:24,104
- They're alive!
- Oh, we did it!

1392
01:06:24,204 --> 01:06:25,808
We did it! We did it!
We did it!

1393
01:06:25,908 --> 01:06:27,277
We certainly did.

1394
01:06:27,377 --> 01:06:30,016
I couldn't be
more proud of you, son.

1395
01:06:30,952 --> 01:06:33,122
Well, actually...

1396
01:06:33,222 --> 01:06:35,160
(chuckles)

1397
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:36,863
...daughter?

1398
01:06:43,944 --> 01:06:45,180
(whining)

1399
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,417
Look, I know...
I know it was crazy,

1400
01:06:47,518 --> 01:06:49,789
I know I promised to give up
this dream, but I couldn't.

1401
01:06:49,889 --> 01:06:52,227
And doing this was the only way
to prove myself.

1402
01:06:52,327 --> 01:06:55,367
To you. To everyone.

1403
01:06:55,467 --> 01:06:57,304
Well, no, you see,

1404
01:06:57,404 --> 01:06:59,643
you said that Joe
is an excellent fireman!

1405
01:06:59,743 --> 01:07:01,947
I mean... I mean, he's me,

1406
01:07:02,047 --> 01:07:03,851
and I'm him, and when
you give me your blessing,

1407
01:07:03,951 --> 01:07:05,420
they're gonna have to
change the rules.

1408
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:09,228
- No!
- What? No what?

1409
01:07:09,328 --> 01:07:11,265
No, you can't be
a fireman, Georgia.

1410
01:07:11,365 --> 01:07:13,403
No matter how good
and strong you are.

1411
01:07:13,503 --> 01:07:16,309
- What do you mean?
- I will never allow it.

1412
01:07:16,409 --> 01:07:19,181
Oh! But it wasn't a problem
when I was Joe.

1413
01:07:19,281 --> 01:07:21,419
Yes, but it's a huge problem
when it's you.

1414
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:24,091
- The job is far too dangerous.
- I don't understand.

1415
01:07:24,191 --> 01:07:26,028
You know it's all
I've ever wanted.

1416
01:07:26,128 --> 01:07:28,333
You gave this passion to me.
It's in my blood!

1417
01:07:28,433 --> 01:07:30,337
It's not in your blood!

1418
01:07:32,642 --> 01:07:34,144
What do you mean?

1419
01:07:35,781 --> 01:07:37,050
(sighs)

1420
01:07:37,150 --> 01:07:40,524
I'm not your real father,
Georgia.

1421
01:07:40,624 --> 01:07:43,797
Of... of... of course you are.

1422
01:07:45,233 --> 01:07:47,170
I'm not.

1423
01:07:49,208 --> 01:07:51,947
(sighs) Do you remember
when I told you

1424
01:07:52,047 --> 01:07:55,788
about the couple
I couldn't save 16 years ago?

1425
01:07:55,888 --> 01:07:58,226
Even though
they were trapped...

1426
01:07:58,326 --> 01:08:01,800
they managed to pass
their baby daughter to me...

1427
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:04,673
three months old.

1428
01:08:04,773 --> 01:08:06,977
Her name was Georgia.

1429
01:08:07,077 --> 01:08:10,183
I swore to them
I would always protect her.

1430
01:08:12,487 --> 01:08:14,592
(whimpers)

1431
01:08:15,861 --> 01:08:17,965
If you become a fireman,

1432
01:08:18,066 --> 01:08:20,203
I can't keep that promise.

1433
01:08:20,303 --> 01:08:22,542
Look at the danger
you're in now.

1434
01:08:22,642 --> 01:08:27,150
You used "girls can't be
firemen" to lock me up at home.

1435
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:29,956
That was the only way
I could think to protect you.

1436
01:08:30,056 --> 01:08:32,729
- I'm sorry, I was wrong.
- (ball clanging)

1437
01:08:32,829 --> 01:08:34,365
(barks)

1438
01:08:34,465 --> 01:08:35,735
Georgia!

1439
01:08:35,835 --> 01:08:38,072
(dramatic organ music)

1440
01:08:42,114 --> 01:08:44,886
(Georgia) What happened?
What happened?

1441
01:08:48,459 --> 01:08:51,198
(grunting softly)

1442
01:08:51,733 --> 01:08:53,570
Dad! Dad!

1443
01:08:53,670 --> 01:08:55,908
<i>People despise change.</i>

1444
01:08:56,008 --> 01:08:58,179
<i>Even those</i>
<i>who are closest to you.</i>

1445
01:08:58,279 --> 01:08:59,916
- (barks)
- No. Ember! Ember! Ember!

1446
01:09:00,016 --> 01:09:02,822
Wait! Wait! No!
Ember, come back!

1447
01:09:02,922 --> 01:09:04,793
Ember! Ember!

1448
01:09:04,893 --> 01:09:06,563
Ember, wake up.
Wake up, Ember.

1449
01:09:06,663 --> 01:09:08,801
<i>I hate little dogs.</i>

1450
01:09:08,901 --> 01:09:10,971
<i>Sorry.</i>

1451
01:09:17,985 --> 01:09:21,292
Wait... Pauline?

1452
01:09:21,392 --> 01:09:24,198
Pauline is dead.

1453
01:09:24,298 --> 01:09:27,471
My stage name is Supreme Fury.

1454
01:09:27,572 --> 01:09:32,782
What'd you think of my
little death scene? Too much?

1455
01:09:32,882 --> 01:09:35,386
We have the same enemies,
you and I.

1456
01:09:35,487 --> 01:09:38,694
The ones who say
my art isn't art,

1457
01:09:38,794 --> 01:09:40,731
that women can't fight fires.

1458
01:09:40,831 --> 01:09:43,837
We are stuck
in their stupid world,

1459
01:09:43,937 --> 01:09:46,777
held back just because
we wanna do something

1460
01:09:46,877 --> 01:09:49,047
that's never been done before.

1461
01:09:49,148 --> 01:09:52,955
Your father... is one of them.

1462
01:09:54,959 --> 01:09:58,332
If we wait for them
to catch up,

1463
01:09:58,432 --> 01:10:01,573
we could wait our entire lives.

1464
01:10:01,673 --> 01:10:03,710
We don't have time for that.

1465
01:10:03,811 --> 01:10:06,482
That's why we have to act now.

1466
01:10:06,583 --> 01:10:10,925
We'll burn it all down
and start over.

1467
01:10:12,628 --> 01:10:15,500
(panting)

1468
01:10:15,601 --> 01:10:17,270
The thing is, Pauline...

1469
01:10:17,370 --> 01:10:20,978
I might never be a fireman,
but I have the fire in my heart,

1470
01:10:21,078 --> 01:10:23,617
and no one can change that.

1471
01:10:23,717 --> 01:10:26,623
Not even my father.

1472
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:28,527
Wrong answer, sis.

1473
01:10:28,627 --> 01:10:32,067
You're clearly not ready
for center stage.

1474
01:10:32,167 --> 01:10:35,006
Too bad you'll miss
my grand finale.

1475
01:10:35,106 --> 01:10:38,947
Dad, wake up! Dad! Dad!

1476
01:10:41,853 --> 01:10:46,128
Dad! Dad, don't worry,
I'm gonna get you out of this.

1477
01:10:46,228 --> 01:10:48,534
Dad, no!
No, no, no, no, no!

1478
01:10:48,634 --> 01:10:50,370
Dad! Wake up!

1479
01:10:50,470 --> 01:10:53,009
Dad! No!

1480
01:10:53,109 --> 01:10:55,681
- No!
- (barks)

1481
01:10:55,781 --> 01:10:57,184
- What?
- (barks)

1482
01:10:57,284 --> 01:10:59,822
Oh, Ember!
Oh, thank you.

1483
01:10:59,923 --> 01:11:01,492
Thank you, Ember.

1484
01:11:01,593 --> 01:11:03,530
(grunts)

1485
01:11:07,370 --> 01:11:08,774
(grunts)

1486
01:11:15,855 --> 01:11:17,290
(barks)

1487
01:11:20,096 --> 01:11:22,334
Oh, Dad. Dad, come back!
Come back, please!

1488
01:11:22,434 --> 01:11:24,873
Dad, you can do this.
You can do this, Dad.

1489
01:11:24,973 --> 01:11:27,277
(grunts)

1490
01:11:29,414 --> 01:11:32,955
Dad! Dad!
Dad, come back! Please.

1491
01:11:33,055 --> 01:11:35,026
(panting)

1492
01:11:35,126 --> 01:11:37,531
(crying)

1493
01:11:40,203 --> 01:11:41,438
I smell mangoes.

1494
01:11:41,539 --> 01:11:43,977
- (coughs)
- (laughs)

1495
01:11:44,077 --> 01:11:47,618
Oh... very funny. Very funny.

1496
01:11:50,824 --> 01:11:53,396
You saved me.

1497
01:11:53,496 --> 01:11:55,901
Just...
Just doing my job, Captain.

1498
01:11:56,001 --> 01:11:58,306
Just doing my job.

1499
01:12:00,443 --> 01:12:03,717
I'm so sorry I held you back.

1500
01:12:05,921 --> 01:12:09,361
My captain told me that
if wanted to be a real fireman,

1501
01:12:09,461 --> 01:12:13,002
I'd have to accept that
sometimes bad things happen,

1502
01:12:13,102 --> 01:12:15,173
and there's nothing more
I can do.

1503
01:12:15,273 --> 01:12:18,547
You have to let it go.

1504
01:12:24,491 --> 01:12:26,228
The day that you were put
in my arms

1505
01:12:26,328 --> 01:12:28,499
is the day my life began.

1506
01:12:30,003 --> 01:12:31,573
I love you, Dad.

1507
01:12:33,944 --> 01:12:35,614
Okay, you find Pauline,

1508
01:12:35,714 --> 01:12:37,918
go find the team,
and call Captain Neil.

1509
01:12:38,019 --> 01:12:40,123
Ember and I will release
the firemen.

1510
01:12:40,223 --> 01:12:42,227
- (barks)
- Are you sure?

1511
01:12:42,327 --> 01:12:45,734
Yeah, go save our city,
Georgia.

1512
01:12:49,441 --> 01:12:52,515
Looks like I'm gonna have to
get used to this.

1513
01:12:54,852 --> 01:12:57,925
<i>Captain Neil here.</i>
<i>Great job, everyone.</i>

1514
01:12:58,025 --> 01:12:59,428
<i>We've stopped</i>
<i>the arsonist's van</i>

1515
01:12:59,529 --> 01:13:01,365
<i>300 feet from</i>
<i>the Chrysler Building.</i>

1516
01:13:01,465 --> 01:13:03,402
- Yes!
<i>- This is a great day</i>

1517
01:13:03,502 --> 01:13:05,808
<i>for the city</i>
<i>and for New York's finest.</i>

1518
01:13:05,908 --> 01:13:09,549
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Come on, I told you.

1519
01:13:09,649 --> 01:13:12,020
- Mangoes and Ember's butt hair.
- Ugh!

1520
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:13,590
Did everything smell
like dog butt?

1521
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:15,393
Look, can we talk
about this later?

1522
01:13:15,493 --> 01:13:16,896
I wanna be there for the arrest.

1523
01:13:16,997 --> 01:13:18,600
But why, when your chances

1524
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:21,573
of actually becoming a fireman
are approximately zero percent?

1525
01:13:21,673 --> 01:13:24,946
Life isn't about percentages,
Ricardo,

1526
01:13:25,046 --> 01:13:27,283
and it can't be zero
'cause I'm doing it right now.

1527
01:13:27,384 --> 01:13:29,622
- Boom!
- You inspire me...

1528
01:13:29,722 --> 01:13:31,125
85 percent!

1529
01:13:31,225 --> 01:13:33,229
Me too, Joe.
Georgia, I mean.

1530
01:13:33,329 --> 01:13:34,766
Sorry, I gotta get used
to it, Joe.

1531
01:13:34,866 --> 01:13:36,402
Georgia. Georgia. Georgia.

1532
01:13:36,502 --> 01:13:39,776
<i>(Neil) Mayday! Mayday!</i>
<i>She's throwing fireballs.</i>

1533
01:13:39,876 --> 01:13:42,447
<i>There's smoke everywhere.</i>
<i>Oh, I can't see anything!</i>

1534
01:13:42,548 --> 01:13:45,186
No, no, no. We have to stop her.
We have to stop her!

1535
01:13:45,286 --> 01:13:48,259
(dramatic organ music)

1536
01:13:55,106 --> 01:13:56,442
Oh! The police cars!

1537
01:13:56,543 --> 01:13:58,345
And the police!
They're hypnotized!

1538
01:13:58,446 --> 01:14:01,653
And nobody to give me
a speeding ticket!

1539
01:14:02,287 --> 01:14:03,690
(Ricardo) Oh, no, no!

1540
01:14:09,101 --> 01:14:11,071
(coughs)

1541
01:14:11,171 --> 01:14:13,844
- There she is!
- I see her.

1542
01:14:31,278 --> 01:14:33,784
No, no, no, no, no!
Come back! Come back!

1543
01:14:35,019 --> 01:14:36,623
(grunts)

1544
01:14:37,457 --> 01:14:39,027
Oh! What is she doing?

1545
01:14:39,127 --> 01:14:41,866
I've no idea,
but I think I'm in love.

1546
01:14:41,966 --> 01:14:44,572
Oh, this is <i>no bueno.</i>

1547
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:01,271
- (engine roaring)
- (cackles)

1548
01:15:01,371 --> 01:15:03,242
(tires screeching)

1549
01:15:04,311 --> 01:15:06,750
(balls rattle)

1550
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:14,231
(hissing)

1551
01:15:32,333 --> 01:15:35,273
(grunts)

1552
01:15:40,316 --> 01:15:42,020
(brakes squealing)

1553
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:43,523
Thank you for the ride, sir.

1554
01:15:43,623 --> 01:15:47,163
Stop talking and save my city.

1555
01:15:47,263 --> 01:15:49,669
Hey, Captain, you made it!

1556
01:15:49,769 --> 01:15:53,175
- Where's Georgia?
- Oh... about that.

1557
01:15:53,275 --> 01:15:54,745
There is only one elevator.

1558
01:15:54,846 --> 01:15:57,383
And the stairs
are not finished yet.

1559
01:15:58,185 --> 01:16:00,490
I need to get up there now!

1560
01:16:01,993 --> 01:16:03,496
(hissing, clicking)

1561
01:16:03,597 --> 01:16:07,605
Let the show begin!

1562
01:16:10,209 --> 01:16:12,046
Seriously?

1563
01:16:16,723 --> 01:16:19,795
Aaaah!

1564
01:16:22,066 --> 01:16:23,570
Georgia!

1565
01:16:23,670 --> 01:16:25,306
Ah...

1566
01:16:30,817 --> 01:16:33,088
Oh, what...?

1567
01:16:37,363 --> 01:16:39,167
What? Georgia...

1568
01:16:39,267 --> 01:16:40,469
Georgia, where are you?

1569
01:16:40,571 --> 01:16:42,307
- Come over here, quick!
- Georgia...

1570
01:16:42,407 --> 01:16:44,712
Hurry up!

1571
01:16:44,812 --> 01:16:47,450
Are you alright, Captain?

1572
01:16:47,551 --> 01:16:50,089
No... My daughter is up there.

1573
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:51,626
Oh, dear heavens!

1574
01:16:51,726 --> 01:16:53,162
- Not there....
- Listen to me, men.

1575
01:16:53,262 --> 01:16:54,832
I want you to surround
the building.

1576
01:16:54,932 --> 01:16:57,905
Here.
Another construction elevator.

1577
01:16:58,005 --> 01:16:59,241
From up there I could...

1578
01:16:59,341 --> 01:17:01,178
Get me some ropes and a grapnel.

1579
01:17:01,278 --> 01:17:04,652
Uh... are you serious, Captain?

1580
01:17:06,288 --> 01:17:08,492
(grunts)

1581
01:17:08,593 --> 01:17:11,733
Georgia. Georgia!

1582
01:17:16,174 --> 01:17:18,012
(grunts)

1583
01:17:19,481 --> 01:17:21,351
Ah!

1584
01:17:24,324 --> 01:17:25,928
(grunts)

1585
01:17:26,028 --> 01:17:28,365
(panting)

1586
01:17:35,446 --> 01:17:37,518
(hums)

1587
01:17:37,618 --> 01:17:40,389
(organ music)

1588
01:17:42,528 --> 01:17:44,999
90 seconds to stop her.

1589
01:17:46,101 --> 01:17:47,905
(plays dramatic tune)

1590
01:17:51,411 --> 01:17:53,182
Where are you, Pauline?

1591
01:17:53,282 --> 01:17:55,019
85 seconds...

1592
01:17:55,119 --> 01:17:56,522
There! Yes!

1593
01:17:57,457 --> 01:17:59,528
(panting)

1594
01:17:59,629 --> 01:18:03,603
No! Georgia, look around you.
Don't run.

1595
01:18:03,703 --> 01:18:05,874
Please don't run.

1596
01:18:05,974 --> 01:18:10,216
Don't run. Don't run, Georgia
Nolan. You're a firefighter.

1597
01:18:10,316 --> 01:18:11,686
75 seconds.

1598
01:18:11,786 --> 01:18:14,457
You walk with purpose.
Think.

1599
01:18:14,558 --> 01:18:17,397
You won't make it in 70 seconds.
She's too high.

1600
01:18:17,497 --> 01:18:19,568
Think.
Take a look around.

1601
01:18:19,669 --> 01:18:21,204
65 seconds.

1602
01:18:21,305 --> 01:18:23,108
The power!
Yes!

1603
01:18:23,208 --> 01:18:25,847
Where's the plug?
Where's the plug?

1604
01:18:25,948 --> 01:18:26,983
There!

1605
01:18:27,083 --> 01:18:29,487
Yes! 60 seconds.

1606
01:18:29,588 --> 01:18:30,891
Can I make it?

1607
01:18:30,991 --> 01:18:34,598
Platform, pulley, ladder,
beam, ladder.

1608
01:18:34,699 --> 01:18:38,238
It's possible. 55 seconds.

1609
01:18:38,339 --> 01:18:40,610
That's great, my love.

1610
01:18:45,286 --> 01:18:47,524
(grunts)

1611
01:18:54,538 --> 01:18:58,012
(yelling)

1612
01:19:00,651 --> 01:19:04,190
Yeah, yeah... No!

1613
01:19:04,290 --> 01:19:07,531
No... No. Argh!

1614
01:19:08,298 --> 01:19:10,069
Okay. Um...

1615
01:19:13,008 --> 01:19:16,783
Easy. One foot
in front of the other.

1616
01:19:16,883 --> 01:19:19,487
One foot in front of the other.

1617
01:19:25,433 --> 01:19:27,203
Whoa!

1618
01:19:27,303 --> 01:19:29,207
Ten.

1619
01:19:29,307 --> 01:19:30,944
Nine.

1620
01:19:31,044 --> 01:19:32,213
Eight.

1621
01:19:32,313 --> 01:19:34,250
Seven. Six.

1622
01:19:34,351 --> 01:19:35,821
Five.

1623
01:19:35,921 --> 01:19:36,856
Four!

1624
01:19:36,956 --> 01:19:37,991
Three.

1625
01:19:38,092 --> 01:19:39,762
Two.

1626
01:19:40,731 --> 01:19:43,001
(music stops)

1627
01:19:43,102 --> 01:19:45,306
What? Argh!

1628
01:19:45,406 --> 01:19:48,112
- Hey!
- Argh!

1629
01:19:48,212 --> 01:19:51,118
Show's over. Huh.

1630
01:19:51,218 --> 01:19:53,823
Yes!

1631
01:19:57,296 --> 01:19:58,733
(grunts)

1632
01:19:59,902 --> 01:20:01,973
(grunts)

1633
01:20:05,514 --> 01:20:07,818
No! Georgia!

1634
01:20:07,918 --> 01:20:09,889
Whoa...!

1635
01:20:13,563 --> 01:20:17,103
Nobody stops my show, Georgia,
not even you.

1636
01:20:17,203 --> 01:20:19,542
It's my time.

1637
01:20:21,512 --> 01:20:23,449
(grunts)

1638
01:20:23,550 --> 01:20:26,923
So we're gonna take it
from the top.

1639
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:37,644
(tires screeching)

1640
01:20:37,744 --> 01:20:39,682
Cheetah. At your service.

1641
01:20:39,782 --> 01:20:41,351
Need a lift, Captain?

1642
01:20:41,451 --> 01:20:43,122
(chuckles)

1643
01:20:43,222 --> 01:20:46,963
Pauline! Please stop!

1644
01:20:50,035 --> 01:20:53,510
Pauline, you're too...
you're too close to the edge!

1645
01:20:53,610 --> 01:20:57,083
Oh, you have no idea, honey.

1646
01:20:57,951 --> 01:20:59,955
Aaaah!

1647
01:21:05,232 --> 01:21:07,236
You ruined everything!

1648
01:21:07,336 --> 01:21:09,608
We could have changed the world!

1649
01:21:09,708 --> 01:21:12,380
We are changing it.

1650
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:15,119
We have the same fire
in our hearts.

1651
01:21:15,219 --> 01:21:16,889
Don't you see?

1652
01:21:16,989 --> 01:21:20,296
But... But you use yours
to harm people.

1653
01:21:20,396 --> 01:21:22,467
I use mine to save them.

1654
01:21:22,568 --> 01:21:23,870
Yeah?

1655
01:21:23,970 --> 01:21:25,807
How are you gonna do that?

1656
01:21:25,907 --> 01:21:28,847
Gonna drop me
like the last time?

1657
01:21:29,815 --> 01:21:31,986
(panting, grunts)

1658
01:21:33,523 --> 01:21:34,925
To calculate
the horizontal distance,

1659
01:21:35,025 --> 01:21:36,929
I'm using 9.81 yards
per second...

1660
01:21:37,029 --> 01:21:39,200
Oh, never mind, just go fast!

1661
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:41,371
Here comes the Cheetah!

1662
01:21:41,471 --> 01:21:44,244
(all yell)

1663
01:21:46,916 --> 01:21:50,122
(tires screeching)

1664
01:21:54,698 --> 01:21:56,802
(laughs)
Ah!

1665
01:21:56,903 --> 01:21:59,307
You see, Pauline?

1666
01:21:59,407 --> 01:22:02,915
Firefighters are one big family.

1667
01:22:03,482 --> 01:22:05,820
(screams)

1668
01:22:07,223 --> 01:22:08,826
Thought maybe
you could use a hand.

1669
01:22:08,927 --> 01:22:11,933
- Hi!
- That'd be nice.

1670
01:22:12,033 --> 01:22:16,174
- How are you, Probie?
- Yeah, feelin' good.

1671
01:22:16,274 --> 01:22:18,947
Feelin' good, Captain.

1672
01:22:23,288 --> 01:22:25,259
Um... Uh...

1673
01:22:26,428 --> 01:22:29,334
(footsteps approaching)

1674
01:22:32,774 --> 01:22:34,678
Dad!

1675
01:22:42,928 --> 01:22:45,600
Do I look like a firefighter?

1676
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:48,806
- You are a firefighter...
- Oh...

1677
01:22:48,907 --> 01:22:52,346
I can't believe what
a beautiful woman you've become.

1678
01:22:54,885 --> 01:22:58,626
I've wanted to give this to you
for the longest time.

1679
01:22:58,726 --> 01:23:03,870
It's... It's everything that
I found out about your parents.

1680
01:23:03,970 --> 01:23:07,076
And... now it's for you.

1681
01:23:11,484 --> 01:23:13,255
Oh...

1682
01:23:20,604 --> 01:23:23,275
Wow...
(chuckles)

1683
01:23:23,375 --> 01:23:25,814
I look like my mother.

1684
01:23:25,914 --> 01:23:28,485
And a little like your father.

1685
01:23:28,586 --> 01:23:32,561
My dad's name is Shawn Nolan.

1686
01:23:32,661 --> 01:23:33,930
He's the greatest dad
in the world

1687
01:23:34,030 --> 01:23:36,268
and I wanna be just like him.

1688
01:23:42,814 --> 01:23:44,852
(whines)

1689
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:47,390
- I love you, Joe.
- What?

1690
01:23:47,490 --> 01:23:48,893
I'm kidding. I'm kidding!

1691
01:23:48,993 --> 01:23:50,897
But that... that Joe
was really something.

1692
01:23:50,997 --> 01:23:53,569
- Always smelled of mangoes.
- Oh, cut it out!

1693
01:23:53,670 --> 01:23:55,607
Ember, were you in
on all of this?

1694
01:23:55,707 --> 01:23:58,278
Of course. It was all her...
idea... actually.

1695
01:23:58,378 --> 01:24:00,850
(whimpers)

1696
01:24:01,585 --> 01:24:03,790
(crowd cheering)

1697
01:24:03,890 --> 01:24:06,127
I vowed to keep you safe

1698
01:24:06,227 --> 01:24:08,866
and I was able to deliver
on that promise

1699
01:24:08,967 --> 01:24:13,643
thanks to the heroic men
and women, heh, heh,

1700
01:24:13,743 --> 01:24:16,114
who stand before you today.

1701
01:24:16,214 --> 01:24:19,053
Don't look at me.
You look into the camera.

1702
01:24:19,153 --> 01:24:21,324
Ow! You're crushing my hand.

1703
01:24:21,424 --> 01:24:23,161
I know. I know.

1704
01:24:23,261 --> 01:24:25,065
It's an honor

1705
01:24:25,165 --> 01:24:28,338
to decorate each of them
with a gold medal,

1706
01:24:28,438 --> 01:24:33,950
for their bravery in protecting
the greatest city on earth.

1707
01:24:34,050 --> 01:24:35,887
We couldn't have done it
without you, Ricardo.

1708
01:24:35,987 --> 01:24:38,191
Thank you, Captain.
Please wish me good luck.

1709
01:24:38,291 --> 01:24:39,895
I'm going to college next year.

1710
01:24:39,995 --> 01:24:43,836
Well, I'm 100% sure
you're gonna do great things.

1711
01:24:43,936 --> 01:24:46,542
Although given my age
and my social issues,

1712
01:24:46,642 --> 01:24:49,748
I wonder if I have a 93% chance
of being bullied and...

1713
01:24:49,848 --> 01:24:53,288
- Ricardo?
- You are right. I can do it.

1714
01:24:57,329 --> 01:24:59,702
You showed great courage, Jin.

1715
01:24:59,802 --> 01:25:01,872
This is going right next
to my medallion.

1716
01:25:01,972 --> 01:25:04,243
- You're driving a cab again?
- Yes, sir.

1717
01:25:04,343 --> 01:25:06,014
I'm working on my emotions.

1718
01:25:06,114 --> 01:25:09,688
Did I mention I'd like
to take your daughter out?

1719
01:25:09,788 --> 01:25:11,124
Hey, Jin, pump the brakes.

1720
01:25:11,224 --> 01:25:13,596
Oh! Sure. No problem, Captain.

1721
01:25:13,696 --> 01:25:16,434
No, take all the time you need.

1722
01:25:18,338 --> 01:25:19,675
Good job, Nolan.

1723
01:25:19,775 --> 01:25:22,279
Thank you, Captain Nolan.

1724
01:25:26,922 --> 01:25:28,626
(whispering) I love you.

1725
01:25:28,726 --> 01:25:30,195
(whispering) I love you too.

1726
01:25:30,295 --> 01:25:34,705
Oh... Now that's true
New York spirit.

1727
01:25:34,805 --> 01:25:36,575
Excelsior!

1728
01:25:36,675 --> 01:25:37,978
Everyone with me!

1729
01:25:38,078 --> 01:25:39,815
Excelsior!

1730
01:25:39,915 --> 01:25:41,284
I'm not crying.

1731
01:25:41,384 --> 01:25:43,923
I just got some...
some pickle juice in my eye.

1732
01:25:44,023 --> 01:25:46,194
You're crying!
(sobbing)

1733
01:25:47,196 --> 01:25:49,400
- (alarm ringing)
- Huh?

1734
01:26:22,333 --> 01:26:25,005
(pickle guy) Half-priced pickles
for everybody!

1735
01:26:25,105 --> 01:26:27,711
Not you!
But everybody else!
