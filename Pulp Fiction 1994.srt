1
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:32,420
Forget it. It's too risky. I'm through doing that shit.

2
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,960
You always say that. The same thing every time.

3
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,970
"l'm through, never again, too dangerous."

4
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,530
I know that's what I always say. I'm always right too.

5
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,010
- You forget about it in a day or two. - The days of me forgetting are over.

6
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,170
The days of me remembering have just begun.

7
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,410
You know, when you go on like this, what you sound like ?

8
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,510
- I sound like a sensible fuckin' man. - You sound like a duck.

9
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:55,040
- Quack, quack, quack. - Take heart, 'cause you're never gonna have to hear it again.

10
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,610
Since I'm never gonna do it again, you're never gonna have to hear me quack.

11
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:03,420
- After tonight ? - Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

12
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,330
- Can I get anyone more coffee ? - Oh, yes !

13
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,690
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

14
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,860
I mean, the way it is now,

15
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,740
you're takin' the same risk as when you rob a bank.

16
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,870
Takin' more of a risk. Banks are easier.

17
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,970
Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you in any way during a robbery.

18
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:26,280
They're insured. Why should they give a fuck ? I don't even need a gun in a Federal bank.

19
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:29,810
Heard about this one bloke, he walks into a bank with a portable phone.

20
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,860
He gives the phone to a teller. The bloke on the other end says,

21
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,490
"We got this guy's little girl. If you don't give him all your money, we're gonna kill her."

22
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,360
- Did it work ? - Fuckin' right it worked. That's what I'm talkin' about.

23
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:45,270
Knucklehead walks into a bank with a telephone. Not a pistol, not a shotgun, a fuckin' phone.

24
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,970
- Cleans the place out. They don't lift a fuckin' finger. - Did they hurt the little girl ?

25
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,740
There probably never was a little girl. The point of the story isn't a little girl.

26
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,800
The point of the story is they robbed a bank with a telephone.

27
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,850
- You want to rob banks ? - I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.

28
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,350
I'm illustrating if we did, it'd be easier than what we've been doing.

29
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:06,580
-No more liquor stores ? -What've we been talkin' about ? Yeah, no more liquor stores.

30
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,630
Besides, it ain't the giggle it used to be. There's too many foreigners own liquor stores.

31
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,630
Vietnamese, Koreans, don't even speak fuckin' English.

32
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,060
You tell 'em empty out the register, they don't know what you're talkin' about.

33
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,070
They make it too personal.

34
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:20,370
- We keep on, one of these gook fuckers gonna make us kill him. - I'm not gonna kill anybody.

35
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,740
I don't want to either. But they'll probably put us in a situation where it's us or them.

36
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,740
And if it's not the gooks,

37
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,440
it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned the store for 15 fucking generations.

38
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:33,950
You got Grandpa lrving sitting behind the counter with a fucking Magnum in his hand.

39
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,950
Try walkin' into one of those places with nothing but a phone.

40
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,960
See how far that gets you. Forget it.

41
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,960
- We're out of it. - Well, what then, day jobs ?

42
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,050
- Not in this life. - What then ?

43
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,420
GarÃ§on, coffee !

44
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,800
This place.

45
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:54,350
GarÃ§on means boy.

46
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,260
This place ? A coffee shop ?

47
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,300
What's wrong with that ?

48
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,030
Nobody ever robs restaurants. Why not ?

49
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,440
Bars, liquor stores,

50
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,240
gas stations; you get your head blown off stickin' up one of them.

51
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,980
Restaurants, on the other hand, you catch with their pants down.

52
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:21,750
They're not expectin' to get robbed. Not as expectin' anyway.

53
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:26,320
- I bet you could cut down on the hero factor in a place like this. - Correct.

54
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:29,660
Same as banks, these places are insured.

55
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,100
Manager. He don't give a fuck.

56
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,000
They're just trying to get you out before you start pluggin' the diners.

57
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:39,030
Waitresses. Fuckin' forget it. No way they're takin' a bullet for the register.

58
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:42,040
Busboys. Some wetback gettin' paid $1.50 an hour...

59
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,640
really give a fuck you're stealin' from the owner ?

60
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,810
Customers sittin' there with food in their mouths, they don't know what's goin' on.

61
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,550
One minute, they're havin' a Denver omelet, the next, someone is stickin' a gun in their face.

62
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,680
See, I got the idea the last liquor store we stuck up, remember ?

63
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,460
- All the customers kept comin' in. - Yeah.

64
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:04,360
You got the idea of takin' their wallets. Now, that was a good idea.

65
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,830
- Thank you. - Made more from the wallets than we did from the register.

66
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,200
- Yes, we did. - A lot of people come to restaurants.

67
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:13,930
- A lot of wallets. - Pretty smart, huh ?

68
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,030
Pretty smart.

69
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,610
I'm ready. Let's do it. Right now, right here.

70
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,180
- Come on. - All right. Same as last time, remember ?

71
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,020
You're crowd control. I'll handle the employees.

72
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,370
- I love you, Pumpkin. - I love you, Honey Bunny.

73
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,070
Everybody be cool ! This is a robbery !

74
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:43,010
Any of you fucking pricks move,

75
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,310
and I'll execute every motherfuckin' last one of you.

76
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,720
- Jungle boogie - Get down with the boogie

77
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,950
- Jungle boogie - Get it on

78
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,220
- Jungle boogie - Get down with the boogie

79
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,520
- Jungle boogie - Get it on

80
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,860
- Jungle boogie - Get up with the boogie

81
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,990
- Jungle boogie - Get up with the get down

82
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,360
- Jungle boogie - Get down and boogie

83
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,600
- Jungle boogie - Shake it around

84
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,460
- Okay, so tell me again about the hash bars. - Okay, what you want to know ?

85
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:11,370
- Hash is legal there, right ? - It's legal, but it ain't 100% legal.

86
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,070
You just can't walk into a restaurant, roll a joint and start puffin' away.

87
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:19,470
I mean, they want you to smoke in your home or certain designated places.

88
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,210
- Those are hash bars ? - Yeah. It breaks down like this.

89
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,610
It's legal to buy it. It's legal to own it.

90
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,880
And if you're the proprietor of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.

91
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:32,350
It's illegal to carry it, but-but that doesn't matter, 'cause get a load of this.

92
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:36,880
If you get stopped by a cop in Amsterdam, it's illegal for them to search you.

93
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,900
- I mean, that's a right the cops in Amsterdam don't have. - Oh, man ! I'm goin'.

94
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,490
That's all there is to it. I'm fuckin' goin'.

95
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:46,500
I know, baby. You'd dig it the most.

96
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:49,300
- But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is ? - What ?

97
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:53,310
It's the little differences. I mean, they got the same shit over there that they got here,

98
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,940
- but it's just there, it's a little different. - Example.

99
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,140
You can walk into a movie theater in Amsterdam and buy a beer.

100
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,850
And I don't mean just like no paper cup. I'm talkin' about a glass of beer.

101
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,750
And in Paris, you can buy a beer in McDonald's. You know what they call...

102
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,320
a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese in Paris ?

103
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,590
They don't call it a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese ?

104
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,460
They got the metric system. They wouldn't know what the fuck a Quarter-Pounder is.

105
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:20,440
- What do they call it ? - They call it a Royale with Cheese.

106
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,970
- Royale with Cheese. - That's right.

107
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,970
What do they call a Big Mac ?

108
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,340
Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it Le Big Mac.

109
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,530
Le Big Mac.

110
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,780
- What do they call a Whopper ? - I don't know. I didn't go into Burger King.

111
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:38,290
- You know what they put on French fries in Holland instead of ketchup ? - What ?

112
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,340
- Mayonnaise. - Goddamn !

113
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:45,720
- I seen 'em do it, man. They fuckin' drown 'em in that shit. - Yuck.

114
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,690
We should have shotguns for this kind of deal.

115
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,430
- How many up there ? - Three or four.

116
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,090
- That's countin' our guy ? - Not sure.

117
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,570
- So that means that it could be up to five guys up there ? - It's possible.

118
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,000
We should have fuckin' shotguns.

119
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,740
- What's her name ? - Mia.

120
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:14,010
- Mia. How did Marsellus and her meet ? - I don't know.

121
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,680
However people meet people. She used to be a actress.

122
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,240
Oh, really ? She do anything I'd have seen ?

123
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,760
- I think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot. - Pilot ? What's a pilot ?

124
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:28,350
- Well, you know the shows on TV ? - I don't watch TV.

125
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:32,060
Yeah, but you are aware that there is an invention called television,

126
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:35,230
- and on this invention they show shows, right ? - Yeah.

127
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,710
The way they pick TV shows is they make one show. That show's called a pilot.

128
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,710
Then they show that one show to the people who pick shows...

129
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,710
and on the strength of that one show, they decide if they wanna make more shows.

130
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:50,310
Some get chosen and become television programs. Some don't, become nothin'.

131
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,580
She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.

132
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:56,420
You remember Antwan Rockamora ?

133
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:00,320
Half-black, half-Samoan. Used to call him "Tony Rocky Horror."

134
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,790
- Yeah, maybe. Fat, right ? - I wouldn't go so far as to call the brother fat.

135
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,700
I mean, he got a weight problem. What's a nigger gonna do ? He's Samoan.

136
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:11,200
- I think I know who you mean. What about him ? - Marsellus fucked him up good.

137
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:15,500
Word 'round the campfire is it was on account of Marsellus Wallace's wife.

138
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:27,680
- So what he'd do ? Fuck her ? - No, no, no, no, no. Nothin' that bad.

139
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,450
- Well, then what then ? - He gave her a foot massage.

140
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,960
A foot massage ?

141
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,090
- That's it ? - Mm-hmm.

142
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,100
Then what'd Marsellus do ?

143
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,330
Sent a couple cats over to his place. They took him out on his patio.

144
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,340
Threw his ass over the balcony. Nigger fell four stories.

145
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:51,470
He had a little garden down at the bottom enclosed in glass, like a greenhouse.

146
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,810
Nigger fell through that.

147
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,820
Since then, he kind of developed a speech impediment.

148
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,020
- That's a damn shame. - Hmm.

149
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:09,530
- But still, you play with matches, you get burned. - What do you mean ?

150
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,760
You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's new bride a foot massage.

151
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,300
You don't think he overreacted ?

152
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:21,240
Antwan didn't expect Marsellus to react the way he did, but he had to expect a reaction.

153
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:25,470
It was a foot massage. A foot massage is nothin'. I give my mother a foot massage.

154
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:29,060
It's laying your hands in a familiar way on Marsellus's new wife.

155
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:34,050
I mean, is it as bad as eatin' her pussy out ? No, but it's the same fuckin' ballpark.

156
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,210
Whoa, stop right there. Eatin' the bitch out...

157
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,880
and givin' the bitch a foot massage ain't even the same fucking thing.

158
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,890
- It's not. It's the same ballpark. - Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither.

159
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,900
Now, look, maybe your method of massage differs from mine.

160
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:49,720
But touchin' his wife's feet and sticking your tongue in the holiest of holies...

161
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,060
ain't the same fuckin' ballpark; it ain't the same league; it ain't the same fuckin' sport.

162
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:58,000
- Foot massages don't mean shit ! - Have you ever given a foot massage ?

163
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,160
Don't be tellin' me about foot massages.

164
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,900
- I'm the foot fuckin' master. - You given a lot of them ?

165
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:08,210
Shit, yeah ! Got my technique down and everything. I don't be ticklin' or nothin'.

166
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,940
Would you give a guy a foot massage ?

167
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:15,050
- Fuck you.

168
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,210
- You give 'em a lot ? - Fuck you.

169
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:21,550
- You know, I'm kind of tired. I could use a foot massage. - Yo, yo, yo, man.

170
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,820
You best back off. I'm gettin' a little pissed here.

171
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,460
- This is the door. - Yeah, it is.

172
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,860
What time you got ?

173
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,060
7:22 in the a.m.

174
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:39,700
No, it ain't quite time yet. Come on. Let's hang back.

175
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,050
Look, just 'cause I wouldn't give no man a foot massage don't make it right...

176
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,320
for Marsellus to throw Antwan off a building into a glass motherfuckin' house,

177
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:57,120
fuckin' up the way the nigger talks; that shit ain't right.

178
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:01,430
Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I kill the motherfucker.

179
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:06,460
I ain't sayin' it's right, but you sayin' a massage don't mean nothin'. I'm sayin' it does.

180
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:11,170
Now, look, I've given a million ladies a million foot massages, and they all meant somethin'.

181
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,970
We act like they don't, but they do. That's what's so fuckin' cool about them.

182
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:17,140
There's a sensuous thing goin' on...

183
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:20,440
where you don't talk about it, but you know it and she knows it.

184
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:25,580
Fuckin' Marsellus knew it. And Antwan should've fuckin' better known better.

185
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:30,060
That's his fuckin' wife, man. This ain't a man with a sense of humor about this shit.

186
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:32,920
You know what I'm sayin' ?

187
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,930
It's an interestin' point.

188
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,930
Come on. Let's get into character.

189
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,880
- What's her name again ? - Mia.

190
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,970
- Mia. - Why you so interested in big man's wife ?

191
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:54,280
He's goin' out of town, Florida. And he asked me if I'd take care of her while he's gone.

192
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:58,310
- Take care of her ? - No, man. Just take her out.

193
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:01,760
Show her a good time. Make sure she don't get lonely.

194
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:04,350
You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace out on a date ?

195
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:07,060
It is not a date.

196
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:11,230
It's just like if you were gonna take your buddy's wife to a movie or somethin'.

197
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,830
- It's just good company, that's all.

198
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:23,610
- It's not a date. It's definitely not a date.

199
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:33,800
Hey, kids. How you boys doin' ?

200
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,550
Hey, keep chillin'.

201
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:45,510
You know who we are ?

202
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,540
We're associates of your business partner, Marsellus Wallace.

203
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:52,650
You do remember your business partner, don't you ?

204
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:58,300
Now, let me take a wild guess here.

205
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:03,360
- You're Brett, right ? - Yeah.

206
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:07,770
I thought so. You remember your business partner Marsellus Wallace,

207
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,670
don't ya, Brett ?

208
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,400
Yeah, I remember.

209
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,810
Good. Looks like me and Vincent caught you boys at breakfast.

210
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,510
Sorry about that. Whatcha havin' ?

211
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,550
Hamburgers.

212
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:24,720
Hamburgers ! The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast.

213
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,390
What kind of hamburgers ?

214
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,190
- Uh, ch-cheeseburgers. - No, no, no.

215
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:33,360
Where'd you get 'em ? McDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-Box ?

216
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:36,230
- Where ? - Uh, Big Kahuna Burger.

217
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,430
Big Kahuna Burger ! That's that Hawaiian burger joint.

218
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:43,440
I hear they got some tasty burgers. I ain't never had one myself. How are they ?

219
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:46,210
They're-- They're good.

220
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,910
You mind if I try one of yours ?

221
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,420
- This is yours here, right ? - Yeah.

222
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,520
Mmmm.

223
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:04,720
This is a tasty burger ! Vincent !

224
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,320
You ever had a Big Kahuna burger ?

225
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:10,860
Want a bite ? They're real tasty.

226
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:14,370
- I ain't hungry. - Well, if you like burgers, give 'em a try sometime.

227
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,270
Me, I can't usually get 'em 'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian,

228
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,470
which pretty much makes me a vegetarian.

229
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:24,710
But I do love the taste of a good burger. Mmmm.

230
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:29,310
You know what they call a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese in France ?

231
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,450
- No. - Tell 'em, Vincent.

232
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,550
- A Royale with Cheese. - A Royale with Cheese.

233
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:39,090
You know why they call it that ?

234
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:42,230
Uh, because of the metric system ?

235
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,600
Check out the big brain on Brett !

236
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:50,010
You're a smart motherfucker. That's right. The metric system.

237
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:54,470
- What's in this ? - Sprite.

238
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,480
Sprite. Good.

239
00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:00,420
You mind if I have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down with ?

240
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:03,350
Go right ahead.

241
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,630
That hit the spot.

242
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:21,760
You. Flock of Seagulls. You know why we're here ?

243
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,370
- Why don't you tell my man Vince here where you got the shit hid. - It's over--

244
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:29,040
I don't remember askin' you a goddamned thing !

245
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,550
You were sayin' ?

246
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,680
It's in the cupboard.

247
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:42,430
N-No, the one by your kn-knees.

248
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,600
We happy ?

249
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,540
Vincent ?

250
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:11,310
- We happy ? - Yeah, we happy.

251
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,680
Look, I'm sorry, uh, l-- I didn't get your name.

252
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,950
I got yours. Vincent. Right ? B-But I never got yours.

253
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:26,360
- My name's Pitt, and your ass ain't talkin' your way outta this shit. - No, no, no.

254
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:30,770
I just want you to know how--

255
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,890
I just want you to know how sorry we are th-that things got so fucked up...

256
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:39,170
with us and Mr. Wallace.

257
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,740
W-We got into this thing with the best intentions. Really. I never--

258
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:47,210
Oh, I'm sorry, did I break your concentration ?

259
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,880
- I didn't mean to do that. Please.

260
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:55,120
Continue. You were saying something about "best intentions."

261
00:18:56,530 --> 00:19:00,430
What's the matter ? Oh, you were finished !

262
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,230
Oh, well, allow me to retort.

263
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,760
What does Marsellus Wallace look like ?

264
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,030
What ?

265
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:15,370
- What country you from ? - What ?

266
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,710
- "What" ain't no country I ever heard of. They speak English in What ? - W-What ?

267
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,480
- English, motherfucker ! Do you speak it ? - Yes !

268
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,250
- Then you know what I'm sayin' ! - Yes.

269
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,760
Describe what Marsellus Wallace looks like !

270
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,450
- What ? l-- - Say "what" again !

271
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:34,460
Say "what" again ! I dare ya ! I double dare you, motherfucker !

272
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:38,430
- Say "what" one more goddamn time ! - H-H-He's black.

273
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,830
- Go on ! - He's bald !

274
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,630
- Does he look like a bitch ? - What ?

275
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:49,400
Does he look... Iike a bitch ?

276
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,710
- No ! - Then why you tryin' to fuck him like a bitch ?

277
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:56,410
- I didn't. - Yes, you did. Yes, you did, Brett !

278
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,650
- You tried to fuck him.- No, no.

279
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,990
But Marsellus Wallace don't like to be fucked by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.

280
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:07,120
- You read the Bible, Brett ? - Yes !

281
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,760
Well, there's this passage I got memorized. Sort of fits this occasion.

282
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:14,170
Ezekiel 25:17.

283
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,540
"The path of the righteous man...

284
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:21,540
is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish...

285
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:24,550
and the tyranny of evil men.

286
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:29,550
Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and goodwill,

287
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,780
shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,

288
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,520
for he is truly his brother's keeper...

289
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:39,140
and the finder of lost children.

290
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:43,020
And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance...

291
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,070
and furious anger...

292
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:49,790
those who attempt to poison and destroy My brothers !

293
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:53,700
And you will know My name is the Lord...

294
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:57,170
when I lay My vengeance upon thee !"

295
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:18,050
I think you gonna find...

296
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,790
when all this shit is over and done--

297
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:26,830
I think you're gonna find yourself one smilin' motherfucker.

298
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,200
The thing is, Butch,

299
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:34,300
right now... you got ability.

300
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,410
But painful as it may be,

301
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,640
ability... don't last.

302
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:47,710
And your days are just about over.

303
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:52,190
Now, that's a hard motherfuckin' fact of life.

304
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:57,290
But that's a fact of life your ass is gonna have to get realistic about.

305
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,660
You see, this business is filled to the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers.

306
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,700
Motherfuckers who thought their ass would age like wine.

307
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:14,140
If you mean it turns to vinegar... it does.

308
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:19,650
If you mean it gets better with age... it don't.

309
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,290
Besides, Butch,

310
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,650
how many fights you think you got in you anyway ?

311
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:30,920
Hmm ?

312
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,960
Two ?

313
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:37,470
Boxers don't have an old-timers' day.

314
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:42,560
You came close, but you never made it.

315
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,840
And if you were gonna make it, you would have made it before now.

316
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,830
You my nigger ?

317
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,900
Certainly appears so.

318
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:23,270
The night of the fight, you may feel a slight sting.

319
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:29,780
That's pride fuckin' with you.

320
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:33,450
Fuck pride !

321
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:38,210
Pride only hurts.

322
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,220
It never helps.

323
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,690
You fight through that shit.

324
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,110
'Cause a year from now, when you kickin' it in the Caribbean,

325
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:55,110
you gonna say to yourself, "Marsellus Wallace was right."

326
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:01,350
I got no problem with that, Mr. Wallace.

327
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:05,220
In the fifth, your ass goes down.

328
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:11,230
Say it.

329
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,930
In the fifth, my ass goes down.

330
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:21,390
Yo, Vincent Vega. Our man in Amsterdam.

331
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:25,930
Jules Winfield, our man in lnglewood. Get your asses on in here.

332
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:29,840
- Goddamn, nigger, what's up with them clothes ? - You don't even want to know.

333
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:33,180
Where's the big man ?

334
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:36,180
The big man's right over there takin' care of some business.

335
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:40,710
Why don't you hang back a second or two. You see the white boy leave, go on over.

336
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,690
How ya been ?

337
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,700
- I been doin' pretty good. How 'bout yourself ? - All right.

338
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:54,170
So I hear you're takin' Mia out tomorrow.

339
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,500
At Marsellus's request.

340
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,340
- Have you met Mia ? - Not yet.

341
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:06,610
- What's so fuckin' funny ?

342
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,280
- Not a goddamn thing. - I got to piss.

343
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:13,620
Look, I'm not a fuckin' idiot, all right ? It's the big man's wife.

344
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:16,350
I'm gonna sit across from her, chew my food with my mouth closed,

345
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:18,390
Iaugh at her fuckin' jokes, and that's it.

346
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,590
Hey, my name's Paul, and this shit's between y'all.

347
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,720
Then what'd you fuckin' ask me about it for ?

348
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,290
Asshole.

349
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,740
- Gimme a pack of Red Apples. - Filters ?

350
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,750
No.

351
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:44,480
- You lookin' at somethin', friend ? - You ain't my friend, palooka.

352
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:50,080
-What was that ? -I think you heard me just fine, punchy.

353
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,750
Vincent Vega's in the house ?

354
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:56,130
My nigger, get your ass over here.

355
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:06,500
- What's up ? - Man, I'm really sorry.

356
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,740
You shouldn't worry about it.

357
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:11,780
Pack of Red Apples. $1.40.

358
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,620
And some matches.

359
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,660
Thanks.

360
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:27,850
It's as if it turns every part of your body into the tip of a penis.

361
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:31,820
- Whoa. - I'll lend it to you. It's a great book on piercing.

362
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:36,290
That gun to pierce your ears, they don't use that to pierce your nipples, do they ?

363
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:40,230
Forget that gun. That guns goes against the entire idea behind piercing.

364
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:45,180
All my piercing, 18 places on my body, every one of 'em done with a needle.

365
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:48,730
Five in each ear, one through the nipple of my left breast,

366
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,940
two in my right nostril, one in my left eyebrow,

367
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,880
one in my belly, one in my lip, one in my clit,

368
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:58,410
- and I wear a stud in my tongue. - Excuse me.

369
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,420
I was just curious,

370
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:04,350
but, um... why would you wear a stud in your tongue ?

371
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:07,920
Sex thing. Helps fellatio.

372
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:11,950
Vincenzo. Step in my office.

373
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:21,800
This is Panda from Mexico. Very good stuff.

374
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:25,310
Now, that's Bava. Different, but equally good.

375
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,310
And that is Choco from the Harz Mountains of Germany.

376
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:32,820
Now, the first two are the same. 300 a gram. Those are friend prices.

377
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,850
But this one is a little more expensive.

378
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,320
This is 500 a gram.

379
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:41,790
But, when you shoot it, you will know where that extra money went.

380
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:45,960
There's nothing wrong with these two. This is real, real, real good shit.

381
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:49,690
But this one is a fuckin' madman.

382
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,530
Remember, I just got back from Amsterdam.

383
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,630
Am I a nigger ? Are we in lnglewood ? No.

384
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:58,870
You're in my home. Now, white people who know the difference...

385
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,940
between good shit and bad shit, this is the house they come to.

386
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:05,380
Now, my shit, I'll take the Pepsi Challenge with that Amsterdam shit...

387
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,750
- any old day of the fuckin' week. - That's a bold statement.

388
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:12,690
This ain't Amsterdam, Vince. This is a seller's market.

389
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,750
Coke is fuckin' dead as... dead.

390
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:20,700
Heroin, it's comin' back in a big fuckin' way.

391
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:25,430
- All right. Gimme three grams of madman. - Okay.

392
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,940
Now, if it's as good as you say it is, I'll come back and buy another thousand.

393
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:31,770
I just hope that I still have some left for ya,

394
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,040
but I'm givin' you some out of my own private stash.

395
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:39,280
That is what a nice guy I am.

396
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:43,450
- I'm outta balloons. Is a baggie all right ? - Yeah, that's cool.

397
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,510
All right. I'll just get one for ya.

398
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:50,530
Honey, will you get me some baggies and, uh, twistix from the kitchen ?

399
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,560
Okay.

400
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:56,160
Hey, uh, what do you think about Trudi ? She ain't got a boyfriend.

401
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:59,530
- You wanna hang out and get high ? - Which one's Trudi ?

402
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,770
-The one with all the shit in her face ? -No, that's Jody.

403
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,280
That's my wife.

404
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:10,940
- I'm sorry, man. - Thank you.

405
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:14,880
- No, I can't. I gotta be someplace. - All right, no problemo.

406
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:17,680
- I'll take a rain check.

407
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,080
- Oh. - Thank you, Jody.

408
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,460
Still got your Malibu ?

409
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:27,620
Oh, man, you know what some fucker did the other day ?

410
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,630
- What ? - Fuckin' keyed it.

411
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,290
- Oh, man, that's fucked up. - Tell me about it.

412
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:36,070
I had it in storage for three years.

413
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:40,470
It was out five days, and some dickless piece of shit fucked with it.

414
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:44,970
They should be fuckin' killed, man. No trial, no jury, straight to execution.

415
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:49,770
I wish I could've caught him doin' it. I'd have given anything to catch that asshole.

416
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:54,580
- It'd been worth him doin' it just so I could've caught him. - What a fucker !

417
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,450
What's more chicken-shit than fuckin' with a man's automobile ?

418
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:00,420
- Don't fuck with another man's vehicle. - You don't do it.

419
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,890
- It's just against the rules. - Thank you.

420
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,120
Thank you.

421
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:07,990
- Mind if I shoot up here ? - Hey, mi casa es su casa.

422
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:11,360
Muchas gracias.

423
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:58,400
Hi, Vincent. I'm getting dressed. The door's open.

424
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:02,670
Come inside and make yourself a drink. Mia.

425
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,550
Hello ?

426
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:18,110
Billy Raye was a preacher's son and when his daddy would visit he'd come along

427
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:20,320
Vincent.

428
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,890
Vincent.

429
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,900
I'm on the intercom.

430
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:29,590
Where is-- Where is the intercom ?

431
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:32,990
It's on the wall by the two African fellows.

432
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:35,160
To your right.

433
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:40,390
Warm.

434
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,570
Warmer.

435
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:44,630
Disco.

436
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,300
Hello ?

437
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:50,710
Push the button if you want to talk.

438
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,840
Hello ?

439
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:56,750
Go make yourself a drink, and I'll be down in two shakes of a lamb's tail.

440
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:00,220
The bar's by the fireplace.

441
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:04,150
Okay.

442
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:06,660
When he started sweet talkin' to me

443
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:09,490
He come and tell me everything is all right

444
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,230
He'd kiss me and tell me everything is all right

445
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,240
Can I get away again tonight

446
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,900
The only one who could ever reach me

447
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:19,600
Was the son of a preacher man

448
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,740
The only boy who could ever teach me

449
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:25,780
Was the son of a preacher man Yes, he was

450
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:28,150
He was

451
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,850
- Lord he knows he was - Yes he was

452
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:35,920
How will I remember

453
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:38,720
The look was in his eyes

454
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,290
Stealing kisses from me on the sly

455
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,960
Taking time to make time

456
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:46,520
Telling me that he's all mine

457
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,540
-  Learning from each other's knowin'

458
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,700
Looking to see how much we've grown

459
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:54,240
And the only one who could ever reach me

460
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:56,570
Was the son of a preacher man

461
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:59,620
The only boy who could ever teach me

462
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,050
Was the son of a preacher man Yes, he was

463
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,920
- Was, was - He was

464
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:07,680
-  Oh, yes he was

465
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,590
Let's go.

466
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:17,200
What the fuck is this place ?

467
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:20,760
This is Jackrabbit Slim's.

468
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,170
- An Elvis man should love it.

469
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:27,440
- Come on, Mia. Let's go get a steak. - You can get a steak here, daddy-o.

470
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:30,310

471
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:33,820
Oh, after you, kitty-cat.

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Now, how may I help you ?

473
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:59,940

474
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:02,910
- We reserved a car.

475
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:08,510
Oh, a car. Why don't you seat 'em over there in the Chrysler.

486
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,340
- Heading down to the drugstore to get a soda pop

Call for...

501
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:42,530
- Phil-lip Mor-ris. - What do you think ?

502
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:47,300
I think it's like a wax museum with a pulse.

503
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:51,210
Hi, I'm Buddy. What can I get you ?

504
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:58,080
Let's see, steak, steak, steak. Oh, yeah, I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.

505
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:00,950
- I'll have that. - How do you want that cooked ?

506
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:04,320
- Burned to a crisp or bloody as hell ? - Bloody as hell, and--

507
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:07,120
Oh, yeah, look at this-- vanilla Coke.

508
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:09,160
What about you, Peggy Sue ?

509
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:12,560
I'll have the...

510
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:16,970
Durward Kirby burger, bloody.

511
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,940
And... a five-dollar shake.

512
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:23,740
How do you want that shake, Martin and Lewis, or Amos 'n Andy ?

513
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:27,940
- Martin and Lewis. - Did you just order a five-dollar shake ?

514
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:30,070
Mm-hmm.

515
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:33,310
That's a shake ? That's milk and ice cream ?

516
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:37,790
- Last I heard. - That's five dollars ? You don't put bourbon in it or nothin' ?

517
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:40,220
- No. - Just checking.

518
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:42,990
I'll be right back with your drinks.

519
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,000
To Lonesome Town

520
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:49,020
To cry my troubles away

521
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,700
Could you, um... roll me one of those, cowboy ?

522
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:57,640
You can have this one, cowgirl.

523
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,640
- Thanks.

524
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:02,110
The streets are filled with regret

525
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,410
Think nothin' of it.

526
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:10,320
Lay me down in Lonesome Town

527
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:13,920
- I can learn to forget - So...

528
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:17,080
Marsellus said you just got back from Amsterdam.

529
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,290
- Sure did. - How long were you there ?

530
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:22,890
Just over three years.

531
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,270
I go there about once a year to chill out for a month.

532
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:32,060
No kiddin' ? I didn't know that.

533
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:35,070
Why would you ?

534
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,680
I heard you did a pilot.

535
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,640
- That was my 15 minutes. - What was it ?

536
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:51,420
It was a show about a team of female secret agents called Fox Force Five.

537
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,220
- What ? - Fox Force Five.

538
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,550
Fox, as in were a bunch of foxy chicks.

539
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:59,090
Force, as in we're a force to be reckoned with.

540
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,930
And five, as in there's one-two-three-four-five of us.

541
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,690
There was a blond one, Sommerset O'Neal. She was the leader.

542
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:08,900
The Japanese fox was a kung fu master.

543
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:13,030
The black girl was a demolition expert.

544
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:15,980
French fox's speciality was sex.

545
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:20,410
- What was your speciality ? - Knives.

546
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,520
The character I played, Raven McCoy,

547
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:26,450
her background was she grew up raised by circus performers.

548
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,790
According to the show, she was the deadliest woman in the world with a knife.

549
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:33,620
And she knew a zillion old jokes.

550
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:37,820
Her grandfather, an old vaudevillian, taught her.

551
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:41,200
And if we would have got picked up, they would've worked in a gimmick...

552
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:45,140
where every show I would've told another joke.

553
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:49,100
You know any of them old jokes ?

554
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:52,910
Well, I only got the chance to say one 'cause we only did one show.

555
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:55,540
- Tell me. - It's corny.

556
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:58,540
Don't be that way. Tell me.

557
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:02,320
- No, you wouldn't like it, and I'd be embarrassed. - You'd be embarr--

558
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:06,330
You told 50 million people, and you can't tell me ?

559
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:10,260
- I promise I won't laugh. - That's what I'm afraid of, Vince.

560
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:12,660
That's not what I meant. You know it.

561
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:16,170
Now I'm definitely not gonna tell you 'cause it's been built up too much.

562
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,830
What a gyp.

563
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:22,370
Martin and Lewis.

564
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:27,850
Vanilla Coke.

565
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:35,520
Mmm. Yummy.

566
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:38,560
You think I could have a sip of that ?

567
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:42,260
Be my guest.

568
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:46,360
I gotta know what a five-dollar shake tastes like.

569
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:49,890
- You can use my straw. I don't have cooties. - Yeah, but maybe I do.

570
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:52,840
Cooties I can handle.

571
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:54,880
All right.

572
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:04,750
Goddamn, that's a pretty fuckin' good milkshake !

573
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:08,880
-Told ya. -I don't know if it was worth $5, but it's pretty fuckin' good.

574
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:47,340
- Don't you hate that ? - Hate what ?

575
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,750
Uncomfortable silences.

576
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,280
Why do we feel it's necessary to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable ?

577
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:00,300
I don't know. That's a good question.

578
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:05,100
That's when you know you found somebody really special.

579
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:09,870
When you can just shut the fuck up for a minute and comfortably share silence.

580
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:14,040
Well, I don't think we're quite there yet, but don't feel bad. We just met each other.

581
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:18,670
I'll tell you what.

582
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:22,010
I'm gonna go to the bathroom and powder my nose.

583
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:25,280
You sit here... and think of something to say.

584
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,460
I'll do that.

585
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:32,730
Okay.

586
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:00,180
I said goddamn !

587
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:03,420
Goddamn ! Goddamn.

588
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:08,620
I need some hair spray.

589
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:16,460
Mmmm.

590
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:20,870
Don't you just love it when you come back from the bathroom to find your food waiting for you ?

591
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,340
We're lucky we got anything at all.

592
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:26,540
I don't think Buddy Holly's much of a waiter.

593
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:29,750
Maybe we should've sat in Marilyn Monroe's section.

594
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:32,880
- Which one ? There's two Monroes. - No, there's not.

595
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,290
That is Marilyn Monroe.

596
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:38,090
That is Mamie Van Doren.

597
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:43,100
I don't see Jayne Mansfield, so she must have the night off.

598
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:46,600
- Pretty smart. - Yeah. I got my moments.

599
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:51,040
- So did you think of somethin' to say ? - Actually, I did.

600
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,640
However...

601
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:59,370
you seem like a really nice person, and l--

602
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:02,280
- I don't want to offend you. - Oooh.

603
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:07,550
This doesn't sound like the usual, mindless, boring, gettin'-to-know-you chitchat.

604
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:10,620
This sounds like you actually have somethin' to say.

605
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:13,530
Well, well, I do. I do.

606
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:17,660
- But you have to promise not to be offended. - No, no.

607
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:21,960
You can't promise somethin' like that. I have no idea what you're gonna ask me.

608
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:26,910
You can ask me what you're gonna ask me, and my natural response could be to get offended.

609
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:29,330
Then, through no fault of my own, I would have broken my promise.

610
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:32,110
- Let's just forget it. - That's an impossibility.

611
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:36,230
Trying to forget anything as intriguing as this would be an exercise in futility.

612
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,510
- Is that a fact ? - And besides,

613
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:43,610
- isn't it more, uh, exciting when you don't have permission ? - All right, all right.

614
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:46,480
Well, here goes.

615
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:49,580
What did you think about what happened to Antwan ?

616
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:53,090
- Who's Antwan ? - Tony Rocky Horror. You know him.

617
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,390
- He fell out of a window. - Hmm. Hmm.

618
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:01,160
Well, that is one way to say it. Another way to say it would be that he was thrown out.

619
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,400
Another way would be he was thrown out by Marsellus.

620
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:09,600
Yet even another way is to say he was thrown out of a window by Marsellus because of you.

621
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,110
- Is that a fact ? - No.

622
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:15,310
No, it's not a fact. It's just what I heard. That's just what I heard.

623
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:18,280
- Who told you ? - They.

624
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:20,820
"They" talk a lot, don't they ?

625
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:25,650
They certainly do. They certainly do.

626
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:30,130
- Don't be shy, Vincent. What else did "they" say ? - I'm-- I'm not shy.

627
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,720
- Um-- - Did it involve the "F" word ?

628
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,790
No, no, no, no, no. They just said that Antwan had given you a foot massage.

629
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:40,970
- And ? - And-- And nothin'.

630
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,910
That's it.

631
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:46,040
You heard Marsellus...

632
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:50,480
threw Tony Rocky Horror out of a fourth-story window for giving me a foot massage ?

633
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:52,490
- Mm-hmm. - And you believe that ?

634
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:57,080
Well, at the time I was told it sounded reasonable.

635
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:00,250
Marsellus throwing Tony out of a fourth-story window...

636
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:03,390
for massaging my feet seemed reasonable ?

637
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:06,920
No, it seemed excessive, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.

638
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,660
I understand that Marsellus is very protective of you.

639
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:14,370
A husband being protective of his wife is one thing.

640
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:18,170
A husband almost killing another man for touching his wife's feet is something else.

641
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:20,840
But did it happen ?

642
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:26,750
Only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was my hand when he shook it... at my wedding.

643
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:29,220
Really ?

644
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:32,620
Truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus threw Tony out that window...

645
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:34,630
except Marsellus and Tony.

646
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:38,690
When you little scamps get together, you're worse than a sewing circle.

647
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:42,700
Ladies and gentlemen. Now the moment you've all been waiting for.

648
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:47,800
The world-famous Jackrabbit Slim's twist contest.

649
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:54,540
Now, this is where one lucky couple...

650
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:59,080
will win this handsome trophy that Marilyn here is holding.

651
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:02,710
Now, who will be our first contestants ?

652
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:05,050
- Right here ! - All right !

653
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:08,140
- I wanna dance. - No, no, no, no, no.

654
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:12,960
No, no, no, no, no. I do believe Marsellus, my husband, your boss,

655
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:16,460
told you to take me out and do whatever I wanted.

656
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:20,220
Now I wanna dance; I wanna win; I want that trophy.

657
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:22,850
- So dance good. - All right. You asked for it.

658
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,880
Let's hear it for our first contestants.

659
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:35,760
Now let's meet our first contestants here this evening. Young lady, what is your name ?

660
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:37,810
Mrs. Mia Wallace.

661
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:40,520
And how 'bout your fella here ?

662
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:42,420
Vincent Vega.

663
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:45,930
All right, let's see what you can do. Take it away !

664
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:48,930
- Go for it. - Come on !

665
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:11,180
It was a teenage wedding and the old folks wished them well

666
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:17,150
You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle

667
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:23,330
And now the young monsieur and madame have rung the chapel bell

668
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:29,600
C'est la vie say the old folks It goes to show you never can tell

669
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:35,640
They furnished off an apartment with a two-room Roebucks sale

670
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:41,820
The 'coolerador was crammed with TV dinners and ginger ale

671
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:47,590
But when Pierre found work the little money comin' worked out well

672
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:53,960
C'est la vie say the old folks It goes to show you never can tell

673
00:48:55,670 --> 00:49:00,040
They had a hi-fi phono and boy did they let it blast

674
00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:06,340
Seven hundred little records all rock, rhythm and jazz

675
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:12,180
But when the sun went down the rapid tempo of the music fell

676
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:19,150
C'est la vie say the old folks It goes to show you never can tell

677
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:48,880
They had a teenage wedding and the old folks wished them well

678
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:54,880
You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle

679
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:33,280
Is that what you call an uncomfortable silence ?

680
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:36,720
I don't know what you call that.

681
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,420
- Drinks ! Music !

682
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,660
I'm gonna take a piss.

683
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:47,690
That's a little bit more information than I needed, but go right ahead.

684
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:02,680
Girl

685
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:04,620
Bomp, bomp, bom

686
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:08,180
You'll be a woman soon

687
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,830
I love you so much Can't count all the ways

688
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,890
I'd die for you, girl and all they can say is

689
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:20,160
He's not your kind

690
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:25,470
You never get tired of putting me down and I never know when I come around

691
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,910
What I'm gonna find

692
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:32,070
Don't let them make up your mind

693
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:35,010
Don't you know, girl

694
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:40,010
You'll be a woman soon

695
00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:43,180
One drink, and that's it.

696
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:47,090
Don't be rude. Drink your drink, but do it quickly.

697
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:51,130
Say good night... and go home.

698
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:57,670
You'll be a woman soon

699
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:00,930
Soon

700
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:05,480
You'll be a woman

701
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:09,950
I've been misunderstood for all of my life

702
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:12,350
But what they're sayin', girl it cuts like a knife

703
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,790
The boy's no good

704
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:17,550
Well, I've finally have found what I been lookin' for

705
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:22,030
But if they get a chance they'll end it for sure Sure they would

706
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,790
Baby, I've done all I could

707
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:29,530
You see, this is a moral test of oneself.

708
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:32,870
Whether or not you can maintain loyalty.

709
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:36,240
Because... being loyal is very important.

710
00:52:36,310 --> 00:52:40,910
You never get tired of putting me down and I never know when I come around

711
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:43,610
What I'm gonna find

712
00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:47,640
Don't let them make up your mind

713
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:50,560
Don't you know, girl

714
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,990
You'll be a woman soon

715
00:52:57,530 --> 00:52:59,470
Please

716
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:03,820
Come take my hand

717
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:07,910
Girl

718
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:13,180
You'll be a woman soon

719
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:16,520
Please

720
00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:20,740
Come take my hand

721
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:24,380
-  Girl
- Hello

722
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:29,890
So, you're gonna go out there and you're gonna say, "Good night.

723
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:32,490
I've had a very lovely evening."

724
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:37,620
Walk out the door, get in the car, go home, jerk off, and that's all you gonna do.

725
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,400
Now it's up to you, girl

726
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:51,100
You'll be a woman soon

727
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:55,680
-  Please

728
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:58,380
Come take my hand

729
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:04,250
-  Girl

730
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:08,020
-  You'll be a woman soon

731
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,700
Soon

732
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:15,860
You'll be a woman

733
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,740
All right, Mia.

734
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:30,910
So listen, I gotta go, all right ?

735
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:37,420
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

736
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:40,220
You fu-- Oh, Jesus Christ !

737
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:42,590
Oh, fuck me. Fuck me !

738
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:47,350
Oh-- Come on, girl. We're gettin' outta here. We gotta walk now.

739
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:00,220
Don't fuckin' die on me, Mia !

740
00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:02,230
Fuck !

741
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,340
Answer.

742
00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:13,840
Have you got the ring ?

743
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:17,740
- Why, certainly. - Join hands, you two lovebirds.

744
00:55:17,810 --> 00:55:20,250
-Please ! Please !

745
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:22,980
Yes, yes. Hold hands, you lovebirds.

746
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:31,380
Fuck you, Lance ! Answer !

747
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:38,400
Now what do you say ?

748
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:41,400
I give up ! I'll marry you !

749
00:55:41,470 --> 00:55:46,130
- Lance ! The goddamn phone's ringing !

750
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,780
I can hear it.

751
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:53,280
I thought you told those fuckin' assholes never to call here this late !

752
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,280
Yeah, I told them.

753
00:55:55,350 --> 00:55:58,610
And that is exactly what I'm going to tell this fucking asshole right now.

754
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:03,020
-Don't you dare strike me ! - Hello.

755
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:05,350
Lance ! Vincent.

756
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:08,360
I'm in big fuckin' trouble, man. I'm coming to your house.

757
00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:12,510
W-Whoa. Whoa. Hold your horses, man. W-What's the problem ?

758
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:15,850
- I got this chick, she's fuckin' O.D.in' on me ! - Well, don't bring her here !

759
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:20,260
I'm not even joking with you ! Do not be bringing some fucked-up pooh-bah to my house !

760
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:22,390
- No choice. - Wh-- She's O.D.in' ?

761
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,660
- She's fuckin' dyin' on me, man ! - Just dandy.

762
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:29,930
Okay, then you bite the fuckin' bullet, take her to a hospital and call a lawyer.

763
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:32,440
- Negative ! - This is not my fuckin' problem, man !

764
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:36,240
You fucked her up, you fuckin' deal with this !

765
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:39,150
Uh, are you talkin' to me on a cellular phone ?

766
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:41,650
I don't know you. Who is this ? Don't come here !

767
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:45,050
I'm hanging up the phone ! Prank caller ! Prank caller !

768
00:56:53,130 --> 00:56:56,070
- What the hell was that ?

769
00:56:58,030 --> 00:57:00,470
Have you lost your fucking mind ?

770
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:03,470
- You were talking about drug shit on a cellular phone ! - Lance, help me.

771
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:06,480
- You crashed your car into my fucking house ! - Grab her feet.

772
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:09,980
Are you deaf ? You are not bringing this fucked-up bitch into my house !

773
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:12,980
This "fucked-up bitch" is Marsellus Wallace's wife.

774
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:15,480
- Do you know who Marsellus Wallace is ? - Yeah.

775
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:18,490
If she croaks on me, I am a fucking grease spot !

776
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:23,150
I will be forced to tell him that you did not help and let her die on your lawn.

777
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:26,160
Now, come on. Help me, help me. Pick her up.

778
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:29,160
- Shit.

779
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:33,600
Lance !

780
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:35,600
Shit.

781
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:38,110
It's 1:30 in the goddamn morning.

782
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:41,510
What the fuck's going on out here ?

783
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:43,510
Who's she ?

784
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:46,520
Go to the fridge and get the thing with the adrenalin shot.

785
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:48,640
- What's wrong with her ? - She's O.D.ing !

786
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,780
- Get her outta here ! - Get the shot !

787
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:54,380
- Fuck you ! Fuck you too ! - What a fuckin' bitch.

788
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:56,390
Just keep talking to her, all right ?

789
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:59,390
She's gettin' the shot. I'm going to go get my little black medical book.

790
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:01,450
What the fuck you need a medical book for ?

791
00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:03,470
I've never had to give an adrenalin shot before !

792
00:58:03,530 --> 00:58:06,970
I don't go joy-poppin' with bubble-gummers ! My friends can handle their highs !

793
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,470
- Get the shot ! - I am, if you'll let me !

794
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:12,470
- I ain't stopping you ! - Stop talking to me. Start talking to her !

795
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:14,480
- Get the shot ! - All right !

796
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:21,080
-Hurry up. We're losing her ! - I'm looking as fast as I can !

797
00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:23,090
What's he looking for ?

798
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:26,090
- I don't know. Some book. - What are you looking for ?

799
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:29,090
- A little black medical book. - What are you looking for ?

800
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:33,260
My little black medical book ! It's like a textbook they give to nurses.

801
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:36,270
- I never saw no medical book. - Trust me. I have one.

802
00:58:36,330 --> 00:58:39,270
- If it's so important, why don't you keep it with the shot ? - I don't know !

803
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:43,270
- Stop bothering me ! - While you're looking, that girl's gonna die on our carpet.

804
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:45,270
You're never gonna find anything in this mess !

805
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:49,240
- I'm gonna fucking kill you if you don't shut up ! - Lance, get in here !

806
00:58:49,310 --> 00:58:53,540
- Right ? Pig. - Get the fuck outta my way.

807
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:57,050
- Quit fuckin' around and give her the shot. - While I'm doing this,

808
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:00,450
you take off her shirt and find her heart.

809
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:04,070
- Does it gotta be exact ? - We're giving her a shot in the heart, so it's gotta be exact.

810
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:07,100
I don't know exactly where her heart is. I think it's right here.

811
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:10,820
- That's it. - All right, what I need is a big, fat magic marker.

812
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:12,830
- You got it ? - What ?

813
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:15,600
A magic marker. A felt pen !

814
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:18,290
A fuckin' black magic marker ! Christ.

815
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:23,430
- Come on, man. Hurry up ! - Fuck ! Okay, okay. Okay. I think it's ready.

816
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:29,110
- Hurry up, man. - I'll tell you what to do.

817
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:32,110
- You're gonna give her the shot. - No, you're gonna give her the shot.

818
00:59:32,190 --> 00:59:35,110
- I ain't giving her the shot. I never done this before. - I never done this either !

819
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:38,170
I ain't starting now ! You brought her here. You give her the shot.

820
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:41,650
The day I bring an O.D.ing bitch to your house, then I give her the shot.

821
00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:43,660
Give it to me. Give me that.

822
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:46,660
All right, tell me what to do.

823
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:49,720
Okay, you're giving her an injection of adrenalin straight to her heart.

824
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:52,730
- But she's got a breastplate-- You gotta pierce through that.

825
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:55,730
You gotta bring the needle down in a stabbing motion.

826
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:59,240
- I gotta-- I gotta stab her three times ? - No, just stab her once !

827
00:59:59,310 --> 01:00:02,740
But it's gotta be hard enough to get through her breastplate into her heart.

828
01:00:02,810 --> 01:00:05,740
Once you do that, you p-press down on the p-plunger.

829
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:08,300
- Okay. Then what happens ? - Kinda curious about that myself.

830
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:11,320
This ain't no fuckin' joke ! Am I gonna kill her ?

831
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:14,820
- She's supposed to come out of it like that. It's-- - All right, count to three.

832
01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:17,080
- All right. Ready ? - One.

833
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:23,890
Two.

834
01:00:31,870 --> 01:00:33,840
Three !

835
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:51,690
If you're all right, then say something.

836
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:54,780
Something.

837
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:56,800
That was fuckin' trippy.

838
01:00:59,370 --> 01:01:02,700
- Ohh. - Oh, man.

839
01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:29,330
Mia. Mia.

840
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,930
What's--

841
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,800
What's your thoughts on-- on--

842
01:01:36,870 --> 01:01:38,900
on how to handle this ?

843
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:40,910
What's yours ?

844
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:47,880
Well, I'm of the opinion that if Marsellus lived his whole life,

845
01:01:47,950 --> 01:01:51,950
he doesn't need to know nothing about this incident.

846
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:54,880
If Marsellus knew about this incident,

847
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:57,010
I'd be in as much trouble as you.

848
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,580
I seriously doubt that.

849
01:01:59,650 --> 01:02:02,590
I can keep a secret if you can.

850
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:06,560
Shake on it ?

851
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:14,060
Mum's the word ?

852
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:16,060
Cool.

853
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:20,460
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go home and have a heart attack.

854
01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:25,130
Vincent.

855
01:02:27,010 --> 01:02:30,030
Do you wanna hear my Fox Force Five joke ?

856
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:33,040
Sure.

857
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:36,140
Except I think I'm still a little too petrified to laugh.

858
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:39,150
No, you won't laugh 'cause it's not funny.

859
01:02:39,230 --> 01:02:42,550
But if you still wanna hear it, I'll tell it.

860
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:44,810
- I can't wait. - Okay.

861
01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:47,760
Three tomatoes are walkin' down the street.

862
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:50,260
Papa Tomato, Mama Tomato and Baby Tomato.

863
01:02:50,330 --> 01:02:54,490
Baby Tomato starts lagging behind, and Papa Tomato gets really angry.

864
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:57,500
Goes back and squishes him and says,

865
01:02:57,570 --> 01:02:59,660
"Ketchup."

866
01:03:02,510 --> 01:03:04,440
Ketchup.

867
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:10,710
See you around.

868
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:35,470
Oh, that Paddlefoot. He funny, silly dog.

869
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:38,470
He think totem pole alive !

870
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:41,270
He arctic tenderfoot !

871
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:45,010
That totem pole been here forever !

872
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:47,020
- Butch ?

873
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:49,950
One more thing, and we'll start for--

874
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:52,960
- Butch, stop watching TV for a second. - Yeah ?

875
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:56,650
- You've got a special visitor. - Stand up. Stand up.

876
01:03:59,430 --> 01:04:04,370
Now, do you remember when I told you your daddy died in a P.O.W. camp ?

877
01:04:04,430 --> 01:04:08,170
Well, this here is Captain Koons.

878
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:11,170
He was in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy.

879
01:04:16,510 --> 01:04:18,450
Hello, little man.

880
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:22,610
Boy, I sure heard a bunch about you.

881
01:04:22,690 --> 01:04:25,920
See, I was a good friend of your dad's.

882
01:04:25,990 --> 01:04:29,020
We were in that Hanoi pit of hell together...

883
01:04:29,090 --> 01:04:31,560
over five years.

884
01:04:31,630 --> 01:04:33,560
Hopefully...

885
01:04:33,630 --> 01:04:36,570
you'll never have to experience this yourself,

886
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:40,070
but when two men are in a situation like me and your dad were...

887
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:42,940
for as long as we were,

888
01:04:43,010 --> 01:04:47,310
you take on certain responsibilities of the other.

889
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:49,310
If it'd been me who'd--

890
01:04:50,650 --> 01:04:52,580
not made it,

891
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:56,920
Major Coolidge'd be talking right now to my son Jim.

892
01:04:56,990 --> 01:05:00,650
But the way it turned out, I'm talking to you.

893
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:03,990
Butch...

894
01:05:05,530 --> 01:05:07,460
I got something for ya.

895
01:05:13,970 --> 01:05:16,030
This watch I got here...

896
01:05:16,110 --> 01:05:20,900
was first purchased by your great-grandfather during the first World War.

897
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:25,640
It was bought in a little general store in Knoxville, Tennessee.

898
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:29,270
Made by the first company to ever make wristwatches.

899
01:05:29,350 --> 01:05:32,280
Up 'til then, people just carried pocket watches.

900
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:35,510
It was bought by Private Doughboy Erine Coolidge...

901
01:05:35,580 --> 01:05:38,520
on the day he set sail for Paris.

902
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:41,020
This was your great-grandfather's war watch,

903
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:44,450
and he wore it every day he was in that war, and...

904
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:48,090
when he'd done his duty, he went home to your great-grandmother,

905
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:52,600
took the watch off, put it in an old coffee can, and in that can it stayed...

906
01:05:52,670 --> 01:05:57,100
until your granddad, Dane Coolidge, was called upon by his country...

907
01:05:57,170 --> 01:06:00,900
to go overseas and fight the Germans once again.

908
01:06:00,970 --> 01:06:04,430
This time they called it World War ll.

909
01:06:04,510 --> 01:06:09,510
Your great-grandfather gave this watch to your granddad for good luck.

910
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:12,580
Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as good as his old man's.

911
01:06:12,650 --> 01:06:15,590
Dane was a Marine, and he was killed...

912
01:06:15,660 --> 01:06:19,680
along with all the other Marines at the battle of Wake lsland.

913
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:22,690
Your granddad was facing death.

914
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:24,700
He knew it.

915
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:28,700
None of those boys ever had any illusions about leaving that island alive,

916
01:06:28,770 --> 01:06:31,970
so three days before the Japanese took the island,

917
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:37,270
your granddad asked a gunner on an Air Force transport, name of Winocki--

918
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:40,280
a man he'd never met before in his life--

919
01:06:40,350 --> 01:06:43,320
to deliver to his infant son,

920
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:47,980
who he'd never seen in the flesh, his gold watch.

921
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:52,390
Three days later, your granddad was dead, but Winocki kept his word.

922
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:56,730
After the war was over, he paid a visit to your grandmother,

923
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:01,030
delivering to your infant father his dad's gold watch.

924
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,040
This watch.

925
01:07:08,910 --> 01:07:14,350
This watch was on your daddy's wrist when he was shot down over Hanoi.

926
01:07:14,410 --> 01:07:17,850
He was captured, put in a Vietnamese prison camp.

927
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:21,980
He knew if the gooks ever saw the watch,

928
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:25,580
it'd be confiscated, taken away.

929
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:29,360
The way your dad looked at it, this watch was your birthright.

930
01:07:29,430 --> 01:07:33,370
He'd be damned if any slope's gonna put their greasy, yellow hands on his boy's birthright,

931
01:07:33,430 --> 01:07:37,370
so he hid it in one place he knew he could hide something-- his ass.

932
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:40,870
Five long years he wore this watch up his ass.

933
01:07:40,940 --> 01:07:45,140
Then he died of dysentery-- He give me the watch.

934
01:07:45,210 --> 01:07:49,080
I hid this uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass two years.

935
01:07:49,150 --> 01:07:51,080
Then...

936
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:55,210
after seven years, I was sent home to my family and...

937
01:07:55,290 --> 01:07:57,220
now...

938
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:02,590
Iittle man, I give the watch to you.

939
01:08:25,450 --> 01:08:27,380
It's time, Butch.

940
01:08:35,130 --> 01:08:38,050
ln the heavyweight division,

941
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:41,280
- in the right corner wearing the blue trunks,

942
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:44,620
weighing 210 pounds,

943
01:08:44,690 --> 01:08:47,820
Floyd Ray Wilson !

944
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:52,830
It's official. It's official.

945
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:55,840
- Wilson is dead ! - Well, Dan, that had to be the bloodiest,

946
01:08:55,910 --> 01:08:58,340
hands down, the most brutal fight this city's ever seen.

947
01:08:58,410 --> 01:09:02,000
Coolidge was out of there faster than I've ever seen a victorious boxer leave the ring.

948
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:05,010
- Do you think he knew Wilson was dead ? - My guess would be yes.

949
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:08,520
I could see the frenzy in his eyes give way to the realization of what he was doing.

950
01:09:08,590 --> 01:09:12,020
- I think any man would've left the ring that fast. - Do you feel this tragedy...

951
01:09:12,090 --> 01:09:14,020
is gonna affect the world of boxing ?

952
01:09:14,090 --> 01:09:18,030
A tragedy like this can't help but shake the world of boxing to its very foundations.

953
01:09:18,090 --> 01:09:22,030
It's of paramount importance, during the sad weeks ahead, the eyes of the W.B.A. remain--

954
01:09:56,870 --> 01:09:59,200
Man, you know I didn't--

955
01:09:59,270 --> 01:10:02,200
- Marsellus. - No, it wasn't. I didn't do it.

956
01:10:02,270 --> 01:10:04,210
I didn't do it.

957
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:06,770
- How you doing ? - Great.

958
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:09,280
I never thanked you for dinner.

959
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:13,120
- What you got ? - He booked.

960
01:10:13,180 --> 01:10:16,280
- His trainer ? - Says he don't know nothin'. I believe him.

961
01:10:16,350 --> 01:10:19,790
- I think Butch surprised his ass same as us. - No, we don't wanna "think."

962
01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:23,450
We wanna know. Take him to the kennel, sic the dogs on his ass.

963
01:10:23,530 --> 01:10:26,960
We'll find out for goddamn sure what he knows and what he don't.

964
01:10:27,030 --> 01:10:28,960
Butch's search-- How do you want it done ?

965
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:31,970
I'm prepared to scour the Earth for that motherfucker.

966
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:35,470
If Butch goes to lndochina, I want a nigger hiding in a bowl of rice...

967
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:37,670
ready to pop a cap in his ass.

968
01:10:37,740 --> 01:10:39,880
I will take care of it.

969
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:51,990
Mister.

970
01:10:54,890 --> 01:10:57,380
- Hey, mister. - What ?

971
01:10:57,460 --> 01:11:02,260
You were in that fight, the fight on the radio.

972
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:05,770
- You're the fighter ? - Whatever gave you that idea ?

973
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:08,600
No, come on.

974
01:11:08,670 --> 01:11:10,610
You're him.

975
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:13,110
I know you're him.

976
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:16,740
Tell me you're him.

977
01:11:16,810 --> 01:11:18,750
I'm him.

978
01:11:19,850 --> 01:11:22,280
You killed the other boxing man.

979
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:28,010
He's dead ?

980
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:30,520
The radio said he was dead.

981
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:35,520
Sorry about that, Floyd.

982
01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:39,320
What does it feel like ?

983
01:11:39,390 --> 01:11:41,330
What does what feel like ?

984
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,330
Killing a man.

985
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:49,160
Beating another man to death with your bare hands.

986
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:51,170
What are you, a weirdo ?

987
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:53,170
No.

988
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:56,680
It is a subject I have much interest in.

989
01:11:58,250 --> 01:12:02,180
You are the first person I have ever met who has killed somebody.

990
01:12:04,690 --> 01:12:07,120
So ?

991
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:10,450
- What does it feel like to kill a man ?

992
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:13,490
I'll tell you what.

993
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:17,500
Give me one of them cigarettes you got up there, and I'll tell you all about it.

994
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:38,450
So, Esmarelda...

995
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:43,160
Villa Lobos-- Is that Mexican ?

996
01:12:43,220 --> 01:12:46,460
The name is Spanish, but I am Colombian.

997
01:12:46,530 --> 01:12:49,830
- That's some handle you got there, honey. - Thank you.

998
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:51,830
And what is your name ?

999
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:53,590
Butch.

1000
01:12:53,670 --> 01:12:56,140
Butch.

1001
01:12:56,200 --> 01:13:00,970
- What does it mean ? - I'm an American, honey. Our names don't mean shit.

1002
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:03,700
So, moving right along,

1003
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:05,710
Esmarelda,

1004
01:13:05,780 --> 01:13:08,040
what is it you want to know ?

1005
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:12,980
- I want to know what it feels like to kill a man. - I couldn't tell ya.

1006
01:13:18,890 --> 01:13:23,330
Didn't know he was dead 'til you told me he was dead.

1007
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:27,990
Now that I know he's dead, you wanna know how I feel about it ?

1008
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:35,180
I don't feel the least bit bad about it.

1009
01:13:46,150 --> 01:13:48,590
What the fuck'd I tell ya ? Huh ?

1010
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:52,590
As soon as the word got out the fix was in, man, the odds went through the roof.

1011
01:13:52,660 --> 01:13:54,860
I know. I know. Unbelievable.

1012
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:58,360
Hey, fuck him, Scotty. If he was a better boxer, he'd still be alive.

1013
01:13:58,430 --> 01:14:00,370
If he never laced up his gloves,

1014
01:14:00,430 --> 01:14:02,870
which he never shoulda done in the first fuckin' place, he'd still be alive.

1015
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:08,520
Yeah, well, who gives a fuck ? It's over now.

1016
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:11,530
Yeah, well, enough about the poor, unfortunate Mr. Floyd.

1017
01:14:11,610 --> 01:14:15,300
Let's talk about the rich and prosperous Mr. Butch.

1018
01:14:15,380 --> 01:14:18,320
How many bookies did you lay it around on ?

1019
01:14:18,390 --> 01:14:20,820
All eight ? How long to collect ?

1020
01:14:22,460 --> 01:14:25,380
So you'll have it all by tomorrow night ? No, I understand.

1021
01:14:25,450 --> 01:14:28,610
A few stragglers aside. Oh, fuck, Scotty, that is good news.

1022
01:14:28,690 --> 01:14:30,920
That is great news, man.

1023
01:14:30,990 --> 01:14:35,190
Yeah. Mm-hmm. No, me and Fabienne are gonna leave in the morning.

1024
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:38,520
It'll probably take us a couple days to get down to Knoxville.

1025
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:40,530
Okay, my brother.

1026
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:42,570
You're right.

1027
01:14:42,630 --> 01:14:44,970
You're goddamn right.

1028
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:48,530
All right, Scotty, next time I see you, it'll be on Tennessee time.

1029
01:14:48,610 --> 01:14:50,940
Cool, brother.

1030
01:15:06,090 --> 01:15:08,520
$45.60.

1031
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:14,030
And, uh,

1032
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:17,400
here's a little something for the effort.

1033
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:21,400
Now, if anybody asks you who your fare was tonight, what are you gonna say ?

1034
01:15:21,470 --> 01:15:23,410
The truth.

1035
01:15:23,470 --> 01:15:26,970
Three well-dressed, slightly toasted Mexicans.

1036
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,280
Bonsoir, Esmarelda Villa Lobos.

1037
01:15:31,350 --> 01:15:33,870
Buenas Noches, Butch.

1038
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,930
Whew.

1039
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:50,290
Keep the light off.

1040
01:15:50,370 --> 01:15:53,300
- Is that better, Sugar Pop ? - Oui.

1041
01:15:57,780 --> 01:15:59,710
Hard day at the office ?

1042
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:01,710
Pretty hard.

1043
01:16:01,780 --> 01:16:04,010
Got in a fight.

1044
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:06,240
Poor baby.

1045
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:08,880
Can you make spoons ?

1046
01:16:08,950 --> 01:16:11,890
You know what ? I was thinkin' about takin' a shower.

1047
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:15,890
- I'm stinkin' like a dog over here. - I like the way you stink.

1048
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:18,390
Let me take this jacket off.

1049
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:24,090
- I was looking at myself in the mirror. - Uh-huh.

1050
01:16:24,170 --> 01:16:26,100
I wish I had a pot.

1051
01:16:27,870 --> 01:16:31,810
You were looking at yourself in the mirror, and you wish you had some pot ?

1052
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:34,810
A pot. A pot belly.

1053
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:37,040
Pot bellies are sexy.

1054
01:16:37,110 --> 01:16:39,410
Well, you should be happy,

1055
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:41,420
'cause you have one.

1056
01:16:41,490 --> 01:16:44,940
Shut up, fatso. I don't have a pot.

1057
01:16:45,020 --> 01:16:48,890
I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna when she did "Lucky Star."

1058
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:50,890
It's not the same thing.

1059
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:54,890
I didn't know there was such a difference between a pot belly and a tummy.

1060
01:16:54,970 --> 01:16:56,900
The difference is huge.

1061
01:16:56,970 --> 01:17:00,390
Would you like it if I had a pot belly ?

1062
01:17:00,470 --> 01:17:02,410
No.

1063
01:17:02,470 --> 01:17:06,900
Pot bellies make a man look either oafish or like a gorilla.

1064
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:10,060
But on a woman a pot belly's very sexy.

1065
01:17:10,150 --> 01:17:15,580
The rest of you is normal-- normal face, normal legs, normal hips, normal ass--

1066
01:17:15,650 --> 01:17:19,700
but with a big, perfectly round pot belly.

1067
01:17:19,790 --> 01:17:22,720
If I had one, I'd wear a T-shirt two sizes too small...

1068
01:17:22,790 --> 01:17:24,720
to accentuate it.

1069
01:17:24,790 --> 01:17:27,220
You think men would find that attractive ?

1070
01:17:27,290 --> 01:17:30,450
I don't give a damn what men find attractive.

1071
01:17:30,530 --> 01:17:33,980
It's unfortunate what we find pleasing to the touch and pleasing to the eye...

1072
01:17:34,070 --> 01:17:36,000
is seldom the same.

1073
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:43,000
If you had a pot belly, I would punch you in it.

1074
01:17:43,070 --> 01:17:46,010
- You'd punch me in the belly ? - Right in the belly.

1075
01:17:46,070 --> 01:17:48,010
Ohh ! I'd smother you !

1076
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:52,010
- I'd drop it right on your face 'til you couldn't breathe !

1077
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:54,010
- You'd do that ? - Yeah.

1078
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:56,050
- Promise ? - Yeah.

1079
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:01,490
- Mmm. - Mmm.

1080
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:06,160
Oh.

1081
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:11,530
Did you get everything ?

1082
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:14,590
- Yes, I did. - Good job, Sugar Pop.

1083
01:18:14,670 --> 01:18:16,600
Did everything go as planned ?

1084
01:18:16,670 --> 01:18:19,400
- You didn't listen to the-- Ow !

1085
01:18:19,470 --> 01:18:21,410
You didn't listen to the radio ?

1086
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:24,770
I never listen to your fights. Were you the winner ?

1087
01:18:24,850 --> 01:18:27,140
I won, all right.

1088
01:18:27,210 --> 01:18:30,180
- Are you still retiring ? - Sure am.

1089
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:32,620
So it all worked out in the finish.

1090
01:18:34,050 --> 01:18:37,490
We're not at the finish yet, baby.

1091
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:48,300
We're in a lot of danger, aren't we ?

1092
01:18:49,870 --> 01:18:52,810
If they find us, they'll kill us, won't they ?

1093
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:57,810
But they won't find us, will they ?

1094
01:19:00,710 --> 01:19:03,650
Do you still want me to go with you ?

1095
01:19:05,220 --> 01:19:08,880
I don't want to be a burden or a nuisance. It's--

1096
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:17,860
Say it.

1097
01:19:17,930 --> 01:19:20,530
- Fabienne,

1098
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:23,730
I want you to be with me.

1099
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:26,800
- Forever ? - Forever and ever.

1100
01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:30,910
Do you love me ?

1101
01:19:30,980 --> 01:19:32,970
Very, very much.

1102
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:41,250
- Butch. - Yes ?

1103
01:19:42,690 --> 01:19:45,280
Will you give me oral pleasure ?

1104
01:19:46,790 --> 01:19:48,730
Will you kiss it ?

1105
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:52,860
But you first.

1106
01:19:52,930 --> 01:19:55,770
- Okay. - Okay.

1107
01:20:05,980 --> 01:20:08,280
Butch.

1108
01:20:08,350 --> 01:20:11,770
Mon amour. L'aventure commence.

1109
01:20:27,430 --> 01:20:29,870
I think I cracked a rib.

1110
01:20:29,940 --> 01:20:33,370
- Giving me oral pleasure ? - No, retard, from the fight.

1111
01:20:33,450 --> 01:20:36,870
- Don't call me "retard." - My name is Fabby.

1112
01:20:36,940 --> 01:20:39,430
- My name is Fabienne ! - Stop it.

1113
01:20:39,510 --> 01:20:41,440
- Stop it ! - My name is Fabi--

1114
01:20:41,510 --> 01:20:44,450
Shut up, fuckhead ! I hate that mongoloid voice.

1115
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:47,610
Okay, okay. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1116
01:20:47,690 --> 01:20:50,620
- I take it back.

1117
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:55,560
Will you hand me a dry towel, Miss Beautiful Tulip ?

1118
01:20:55,630 --> 01:20:59,560
- Oh, I like that. I like being called a tulip.

1119
01:20:59,630 --> 01:21:02,060
"Tulip" is much better than "mongoloid."

1120
01:21:02,130 --> 01:21:05,070
I didn't call you a mongoloid. I called you a retard.

1121
01:21:05,140 --> 01:21:07,260
And I took it back.

1122
01:21:07,340 --> 01:21:09,430
- Butch ?

1123
01:21:09,510 --> 01:21:11,440
Yes, Lemon Pie ?

1124
01:21:11,510 --> 01:21:14,940
- Where are we going to go ? - Well, I'm not sure yet.

1125
01:21:15,010 --> 01:21:17,140
Wherever you want.

1126
01:21:17,210 --> 01:21:20,150
We're gonna get a lot of money from this,

1127
01:21:20,220 --> 01:21:23,150
but it ain't gonna be the kind of money...

1128
01:21:23,220 --> 01:21:26,160
that we can live like hogs in the fathouse forever.

1129
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:30,160
I was thinking maybe we could go down someplace in the South Pacific.

1130
01:21:30,230 --> 01:21:33,660
Kind of money we're gonna have's gonna carry us a long way down there.

1131
01:21:33,730 --> 01:21:36,670
- If we wanted, we could live in Bora Bora ? - You betcha.

1132
01:21:36,730 --> 01:21:40,170
And if after a while you didn't dig that, we could go someplace else.

1133
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:42,170
Maybe Tahiti, Mexico.

1134
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:44,170
But I do not speak Spanish.

1135
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:47,210
Well, you do not speak Bora-Boran either.

1136
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:49,250
Besides, Mexican's easy.

1137
01:21:49,310 --> 01:21:52,250
- Â¿ Donde esta el zapateria ? - What does that mean ?

1138
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,250
Where is the shoe store?

1139
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:56,250
- Â¿ Donde esta-- - Spit, please.

1140
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:01,590
- Â¿ Donde esta el zapateria ? - Excellent pronunciation.

1141
01:22:01,660 --> 01:22:03,680
- Mmm.

1142
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:07,060
You'll be my little mamacita in no time.

1143
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:09,660
- Â¿ Que hora es ? - Â¿ Que hora es ?

1144
01:22:09,730 --> 01:22:11,890
- What time is it ? - What time is it ?

1145
01:22:11,970 --> 01:22:14,600
Time for bed.

1146
01:22:14,670 --> 01:22:16,610
Sweet dreams, jellybean.

1147
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:26,250
Butch ?

1148
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:34,090
Never mind.

1149
01:22:41,070 --> 01:22:43,690
Aah !

1150
01:22:43,770 --> 01:22:47,830
Merde ! You startled me. Did you have a bad dream ?

1151
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:02,540
- What is this you're watching ? - A motorcycle movie.

1152
01:23:02,620 --> 01:23:04,550
I'm not sure the name.

1153
01:23:06,460 --> 01:23:09,540
- Are you watching it ? - In a way.

1154
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:15,450
It's a little early in the morning for explosions and war.

1155
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:22,730
- What was it about ? - How should I know ? You were the one watching it.

1156
01:23:22,810 --> 01:23:26,790
- No, imbecile, what was your dream about ? - I don't know.

1157
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,800
I don't remember.

1158
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:31,800
It's really rare that I remember my dreams.

1159
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:34,840
Well, let's look at the grumpy man in the morning.

1160
01:23:36,910 --> 01:23:39,850
Why don't you get up and we'll get some breakfast.

1161
01:23:39,910 --> 01:23:42,540
One more kiss, and I'll get up.

1162
01:23:44,690 --> 01:23:47,920
- Satisfied ? - Yep.

1163
01:23:47,990 --> 01:23:51,420
- Get up, lazy bones ! - Ohh !

1164
01:23:51,490 --> 01:23:54,550
- Ohh. God.

1165
01:23:55,860 --> 01:23:59,390
- What time is it ? - Almost nine in the morning.

1166
01:23:59,470 --> 01:24:03,230
- What time does our train arrive ? - Eleven.

1167
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:07,670
- You know what I'm gonna have for breakfast ? - What, Lemon Pie ?

1168
01:24:07,740 --> 01:24:11,870
I'm gonna order a big plate of blueberry pancakes...

1169
01:24:11,950 --> 01:24:13,880
with maple syrup,

1170
01:24:13,950 --> 01:24:17,380
eggs over easy and five sausages.

1171
01:24:17,450 --> 01:24:19,650
Anything to drink with that ?

1172
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:23,380
Wow, that looks nice.

1173
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:26,790
To drink-- A tall glass of orange juice...

1174
01:24:26,860 --> 01:24:29,290
and a black cup of coffee.

1175
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:33,930
- After that, I'm going to have a slice of pie. - Pie for breakfast ?

1176
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,940
- Any time of the day is a good time for pie.

1177
01:24:38,010 --> 01:24:40,940
Blueberry pie to go with the pancakes.

1178
01:24:41,010 --> 01:24:44,000
And on top, a thin slice of melted cheese.

1179
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:46,010
Where's my watch ?

1180
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:52,750
It's there.

1181
01:24:52,820 --> 01:24:55,410
- No, it's not. - Have you looked ?

1182
01:24:55,490 --> 01:24:59,760
Yes, I've fuckin' looked. What the fuck do you think I'm doin' ?

1183
01:24:59,830 --> 01:25:01,950
You sure you got it ?

1184
01:25:02,030 --> 01:25:04,330
Yes. Bedside table drawer.

1185
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:07,560
- On the little kangaroo ? - Yes, it was on the little kangaroo.

1186
01:25:07,630 --> 01:25:10,800
Yeah, well, it's not here now.

1187
01:25:10,870 --> 01:25:13,740
- Well, it should be.

1188
01:25:13,810 --> 01:25:17,610
Yes, it most definitely should be, but it's not here now ! So where the fuck is it ?

1189
01:25:23,180 --> 01:25:26,620
Fabienne, where's my father's fucking watch ?

1190
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:32,730
Do you have any idea what he had to go through to get me that watch ?

1191
01:25:32,790 --> 01:25:35,730
I don't have time to go into it, but he went through a lot.

1192
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:41,130
All this other shit you could've set on fire, but I specifically reminded you not to forget the fucking watch.

1193
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:42,530
Now think.

1194
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:46,130
- Did you get it ? - I believe so.

1195
01:25:46,210 --> 01:25:49,460
"You believe so" ? What the fuck does that mean ? You either did or didn't get it.

1196
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,810
Then I did.

1197
01:25:54,180 --> 01:25:56,120
Are you sure ?

1198
01:25:57,220 --> 01:25:59,150
No.

1199
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:03,180
Fuck ! Fuck ! Fuck !

1200
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:05,620
Motherfucker ! Motherfuckin'--

1201
01:26:07,530 --> 01:26:10,330
Do you know how fucking stupid you fucking are ?

1202
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:12,320
No !

1203
01:26:14,970 --> 01:26:16,890
It's not your fault.

1204
01:26:21,710 --> 01:26:24,130
You left it at the apartment.

1205
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:33,140
If you left it at the apartment, it's not your fault.

1206
01:26:35,210 --> 01:26:38,340
I had you bring a bunch of stuff.

1207
01:26:40,550 --> 01:26:42,490
I reminded you about it,

1208
01:26:42,550 --> 01:26:47,320
but I didn't illustrate how personal the watch was to me.

1209
01:26:47,390 --> 01:26:51,420
If all I gave a fuck about was the watch, I shoulda told you that.

1210
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:53,930
You're not a mind reader.

1211
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,930
Are you ?

1212
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:08,010
I-- I'm sorry.

1213
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:11,670
Don't be. Just means I can't have breakfast with you.

1214
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:14,440
Why does it mean that ?

1215
01:27:17,020 --> 01:27:20,350
Because I gotta go back to my apartment and get my watch.

1216
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:24,080
Won't the gangsters be looking for you there ?

1217
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:28,430
Well, that's what I'm gonna find out.

1218
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:31,730
If they are, and I don't think I can handle it,

1219
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:33,740
then I'll split.

1220
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:38,100
I saw your watch. I thought I brought it. I'm so sorry.

1221
01:27:43,380 --> 01:27:46,440
Here's some money. Go out and get those pancakes.

1222
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:48,380
Have a nice breakfast.

1223
01:27:48,450 --> 01:27:51,890
I'll take your Honda. I'll be back before you can say "blueberry pie."

1224
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:54,390
Blueberry pie.

1225
01:27:54,460 --> 01:27:56,620
Maybe not that fast.

1226
01:27:56,690 --> 01:27:59,890
- But pretty fast. Okay ? - Okay.

1227
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:02,300

1230
01:28:07,370 --> 01:28:09,310

1231
01:28:09,370 --> 01:28:11,500
bedside table, on the kangaroo.

1232
01:28:11,580 --> 01:28:14,840
I said the words: "Don't forget my father's watch."

1233
01:28:30,330 --> 01:28:33,760

Toss the weapon.

01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:48,300

01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:33,920
Whoa, my angel

01:38:18,250 --> 01:38:21,180
Nobody kills anybody in my place of business...

01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:24,180
- except me or Zed.

1295
01:38:26,450 --> 01:38:28,380
That's Zed.

1296
01:38:41,030 --> 01:38:44,470
- I thought you said you waited for me. - I did.

1297
01:38:48,770 --> 01:38:51,710
Then how come they're all beat up ?

1298
01:38:51,770 --> 01:38:56,040
They did that to each other, man. They came in fightin'.

1299
01:38:56,110 --> 01:39:00,450
Now, this 'un right here, he was gonna shoot that one.

1300
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:03,880
Is that right ? You gonna shoot him, boy ?

1301
01:39:03,950 --> 01:39:06,550
Huh ?

01:39:19,070 --> 01:39:23,330
Well, bring out the Gimp.

1306
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:27,170
I think the Gimp's sleepin'.

1307
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:31,180
Then I guess you'll just have to go wake him up now, won't you ?

1308
01:40:10,290 --> 01:40:12,220
Get up.

1309
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:27,440
Get down.

1310
01:40:37,510 --> 01:40:40,450
Which one of 'em you wanna do first ?

1311
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:44,250
- I ain't for sure yet.

1312
01:40:47,790 --> 01:40:50,450

If he hollers, let him go.

1316
01:40:59,700 --> 01:41:03,820
Eenie-meenie-minie-mo.

1317
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:09,730

1324
01:41:34,230 --> 01:41:36,960
Sounds good to me.

1325
01:42:00,890 --> 01:42:03,980
You keep an eye on this 'un.

1326

01:45:44,740 --> 01:45:46,680
Huh ?

Go ahead and pick it up.

1346
01:45:52,020 --> 01:45:54,350
Go ahead. Pick it up.

01:46:09,030 --> 01:46:12,090

No, man.

1353
01:46:36,530 --> 01:46:39,460
I'm pretty fuckin' far from okay.

1354
01:46:50,640 --> 01:46:53,580
- What now ?

1355
01:46:55,910 --> 01:46:57,850
"What now" ?

1356
01:46:59,220 --> 01:47:02,640
- Let me tell you what now.

1357
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:05,650
I'm gonna call a couple of hard, pipe-hittin' niggers...

1358
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:08,650
to go to work on the homes here...

1359
01:47:08,730 --> 01:47:11,650
with a pair of pliers and a blowtorch.

1360
01:47:13,630 --> 01:47:16,320
You hear me talkin', hillbilly boy ?

1361
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:20,150
I ain't through with you by a damn sight !

1362
01:47:20,230 --> 01:47:23,160
I'm gonna get medieval on your ass.

1363
01:47:26,440 --> 01:47:29,370
I meant what now between me and you.

1364
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:36,840
Oh, that "what now."

1365
01:47:38,280 --> 01:47:42,220
- I tell you what now between me and you.

1366
01:47:43,790 --> 01:47:46,720
There is no me and you.

1367
01:47:48,160 --> 01:47:50,090
Not no more.

1368
01:47:53,160 --> 01:47:55,100
So, are we cool ?

1369
01:47:56,470 --> 01:47:58,760
Yeah, we cool.

1370
01:47:58,830 --> 01:48:00,960
- Two things.

1371
01:48:02,740 --> 01:48:05,670
Don't tell nobody about this.

1372
01:48:07,140 --> 01:48:10,770
This shit is between me, you...

1373
01:48:10,850 --> 01:48:15,310
and Mr. "Soon-To-Be-Livin' The-Rest-Of-His-Short-Ass- Life-ln-Agonizing-Pain"...

1374
01:48:15,380 --> 01:48:17,320
rapist here.

1375
01:48:18,620 --> 01:48:21,380
It ain't nobody else's business.

1376
01:48:21,460 --> 01:48:23,390
Two:

1377
01:48:23,460 --> 01:48:26,950
You leave town tonight. Right now.

1378
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:30,130
And when you gone,

1379
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:32,130
you stay gone,

1380
01:48:32,200 --> 01:48:35,140
- or you be gone.

1381
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:38,140
You lost all your L.A. privileges. Deal ?

1382
01:48:39,980 --> 01:48:41,910
Deal.

1383
01:48:43,150 --> 01:48:45,080
Get your ass outta here.

1384
01:49:11,540 --> 01:49:13,790
Oh, shit.

1385
01:49:46,790 --> 01:49:49,220
Fabienne !

1386
01:49:50,290 --> 01:49:53,230
Fabienne !

1387
01:49:54,460 --> 01:49:56,560
Fabienne ! Come on, baby.

1388
01:49:56,630 --> 01:50:00,060
- Come on. Get your shit. We gotta go right now. - I was so worried.

1389
01:50:00,140 --> 01:50:03,560
- What about our bags ? - Fuck the bags; if we don't split right now, we'll miss the train.

1390
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:05,560
- I'll be downstairs. - Is everything well ?

1391
01:50:05,630 --> 01:50:09,570
- Just come on ! No talking now ! - Are we in danger ?

1392
01:50:13,080 --> 01:50:15,010
Come on, honey !

1393
01:50:17,090 --> 01:50:19,550
Where did you get this motorcycle ?

1394
01:50:19,610 --> 01:50:24,140
- It's not a motorcycle, baby. It's a chopper. Let's go. - What happened to my Honda ?

1395
01:50:24,220 --> 01:50:27,980
I'm sorry, baby, I had to crash that Honda. Will you come on now, please ?

1396
01:50:28,050 --> 01:50:30,450
Come on. Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1397
01:50:35,030 --> 01:50:38,460
- You're hurt ? - No, no, I might've broken my nose. It's no biggie.

1398
01:50:38,530 --> 01:50:41,470
Come on. Hop on. Baby, please, we--

1399
01:50:41,540 --> 01:50:44,470
Honey, we gotta hit the fuckin' road ! Get on !

1400
01:50:46,140 --> 01:50:49,580
- Oh, baby, I'm sorry. Come here, come here.

1401
01:50:49,640 --> 01:50:51,580
I'm sorry. Mmm.

1402
01:50:51,650 --> 01:50:55,580
- I'm so sorry. - You were gone so long, I started to think dreadful thoughts.

1403
01:50:55,650 --> 01:50:58,580
I didn't mean to worry you. Everything's fine.

1404
01:50:58,650 --> 01:51:00,590
- How was your breakfast ? - It was good.

1405
01:51:00,650 --> 01:51:02,590
Did you get the blueberry pancakes ?

1406
01:51:02,660 --> 01:51:06,590
They didn't have blueberry; I had to get buttermilk. Are you sure you're okay ?

1407
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:09,600
Since I left you, this has been, without a doubt,

1408
01:51:09,660 --> 01:51:12,890
the single weirdest fuckin' day of my life-- I'll tell you all about it.

1409
01:51:12,970 --> 01:51:14,830
Gotta go. Come on.

1410
01:51:14,900 --> 01:51:17,670
Butch, whose motorcycle is this ?

1411
01:51:17,740 --> 01:51:20,330
- It's a chopper, baby. - Whose chopper is this ?

1412
01:51:20,410 --> 01:51:22,340
- Zed's. - Who's Zed ?

1413
01:51:22,410 --> 01:51:24,970
Zed's dead, baby. Zed's dead.

1414
01:51:41,160 --> 01:51:43,460
Yes, you did, Brett !

1415
01:51:43,530 --> 01:51:47,060
You tried to fuck him, and Marsellus Wallace don't liked to be fucked...

1416
01:51:47,130 --> 01:51:49,570
by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.

1417
01:51:49,640 --> 01:51:52,730
- Oh, God, please. I don't wanna die. - You read the Bible, Brett ?

1418
01:51:52,810 --> 01:51:56,240
- Yes ! - Well, there's this passage I got memorized.

1419
01:51:56,310 --> 01:51:58,470
Sorta fits the occasion.

1420
01:51:58,550 --> 01:52:01,840
Ezekiel 25:17.

1421
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:06,220
"The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides...

1422
01:52:06,290 --> 01:52:08,220
by the inequities of the selfish...

1423
01:52:08,290 --> 01:52:11,720
- and the tyranny of evil men.

1424
01:52:11,790 --> 01:52:16,460
Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will,

1425
01:52:16,530 --> 01:52:19,560
shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,

1426
01:52:19,630 --> 01:52:22,160
for he is truly his brother's keeper...

1427
01:52:22,240 --> 01:52:24,970
and the finder of lost children.

1428
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:29,300
And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance...

1429
01:52:29,380 --> 01:52:31,540
and furious anger...

1430
01:52:31,610 --> 01:52:36,000
those who attempt to poison and destroy My brothers.

1431
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:39,950
And you will know My name is the Lord...

1432
01:52:40,020 --> 01:52:43,410
when I lay My vengeance upon thee."

1433
01:52:51,500 --> 01:52:53,920
I'm fucked. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

1434
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,940
- ls he a friend of yours ? - Oh, goddamn. Goddamn.

1435
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,940
Hmm ? Oh. Vincent, Marvin. Marvin, Vincent.

1436
01:53:00,010 --> 01:53:02,930
- Better tell him to shut up. He's gettin' on my nerves. - Fuck.

1437
01:53:03,010 --> 01:53:06,700
Marvin. Marvin ! I'd knock that shit off if I was you.

1438
01:53:06,780 --> 01:53:10,930
- Die, you motherfuckers ! Die !

1439
01:53:38,700 --> 01:53:42,140
Why the fuck didn't you tell us somebody was in the bathroom ?

1440
01:53:42,210 --> 01:53:45,070
Slip your mind ? Did you forget that someone was in there...

1441
01:53:45,140 --> 01:53:47,080
with a goddamn hand cannon ?

1442
01:53:47,140 --> 01:53:51,080
You see the size of that gun he fired at us ? It was bigger than him.

1443
01:53:55,850 --> 01:53:58,550
We should be fuckin' dead, man.

1444
01:53:58,620 --> 01:54:00,560
I know. We was lucky.

1445
01:54:00,620 --> 01:54:03,750
No, no, no, no. That shit wasn't luck.

1446
01:54:03,830 --> 01:54:08,030
- Yeah, maybe. - This was divine intervention.

1447
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:10,030
You know what divine intervention is ?

1448
01:54:15,910 --> 01:54:17,840
I think so.

1449
01:54:17,910 --> 01:54:21,340
That means that God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets.

1450
01:54:21,410 --> 01:54:23,850
That's right. That's exactly what it means.

1451
01:54:23,910 --> 01:54:26,880
God came down from Heaven and stopped these motherfuckin' bullets.

1452
01:54:28,120 --> 01:54:30,110
I think it's time for us to leave, Jules.

1453
01:54:30,190 --> 01:54:32,620
Don't do that. Don't fuckin' blow this shit off !

1454
01:54:32,690 --> 01:54:36,630
- What just happened here was a fuckin' miracle ! - Chill. This shit happens.

1455
01:54:36,690 --> 01:54:39,460
Wrong ! Wrong. This shit doesn't "just happen."

1456
01:54:39,530 --> 01:54:42,970
Do you want to continue this theological discussion in a car...

1457
01:54:43,030 --> 01:54:45,470
or in a jailhouse with the cops ?

1458
01:54:45,540 --> 01:54:48,160
We should be fuckin' dead, my friend !

1459
01:54:48,240 --> 01:54:52,470
What happened here was a miracle, and I want you to fucking acknowledge it !

1460
01:54:52,540 --> 01:54:57,240
All right, it was a miracle. Can we go now ?

1461
01:55:04,250 --> 01:55:07,620
Let's go, nigger ! Come on ! Shit.

1462
01:55:09,500 --> 01:55:11,300
You ever seen that show Cops ?

1463
01:55:11,370 --> 01:55:14,300
I was watching it one time, and there was this cop on,

1464
01:55:14,370 --> 01:55:18,310
and he was talkin' about this gunfight he had in the hallway with this guy, right ?

1465
01:55:18,380 --> 01:55:21,830
He just unloaded on this guy and nothin' happened. He didn't hit nothin'.

1466
01:55:21,910 --> 01:55:24,850
Okay ? It was just him and this guy.

1467
01:55:24,920 --> 01:55:28,250
I mean, you know, it's, it's freaky, but it happens.

1468
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:33,260
You wanna play blind man, go walk with the shepherd, but me, my eyes are wide fuckin' open.

1469
01:55:33,320 --> 01:55:36,260
- What the fuck does that mean ? - It means that's it for me.

1470
01:55:36,330 --> 01:55:39,020
From here on in, you can consider my ass retired.

1471
01:55:39,100 --> 01:55:41,260
- Jesus Christ. Goddamn it. - Don't blaspheme.

1472
01:55:41,330 --> 01:55:44,380
- I said, don't do that ! - Hey, why are you fuckin' freakin' out on us ?

1473
01:55:44,470 --> 01:55:47,520
Look, I'm tellin' Marsellus today-- I'm through.

1474
01:55:47,610 --> 01:55:50,530
- Why don't you tell him at the same time why ? - Don't worry, I will.

1475
01:55:50,610 --> 01:55:54,590
- And I bet you $10,000 he laughs his ass off. - I don't give a damn if he does.

1476
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:57,960
Marvin, what do you make of all this ?

1477
01:55:58,050 --> 01:56:00,470
Man, I don't even have an opinion.

1478
01:56:00,550 --> 01:56:04,770
You gotta have an opinion. You think God came down from Heaven and stopped--

1479
01:56:04,860 --> 01:56:06,840
- What the fuck's happenin' ?

1480
01:56:06,910 --> 01:56:08,850
- Aw, shit, man ! - Aw, man !

1481
01:56:08,930 --> 01:56:11,230
- Oh, man, I shot Marvin in the face. - Why the fuck'd you do that ?

1482
01:56:11,230 --> 01:56:11,850
I didn't mean it. It was an accident.
- Oh, man, I shot Marvin in the face. - Why the fuck'd you do that ?

1483
01:56:11,850 --> 01:56:13,150
I didn't mean it. It was an accident.

1484
01:56:13,230 --> 01:56:16,160
- Man, I seen some crazy-ass shit in my time, but this-- - Chill out, man !

1485
01:56:16,220 --> 01:56:19,160
It was an accident. We probably went over a bump or somethin'.

1486
01:56:19,230 --> 01:56:21,160
The car ain't hit no motherfuckin' bump.

1487
01:56:21,730 --> 01:56:25,060
I didn't mean to shoot the son of a bitch. The gun went off.

1488
01:56:25,130 --> 01:56:28,570
Look at this fuckin' mess ! We're on a city street in broad daylight here !

1489
01:56:28,640 --> 01:56:31,570
- I don't believe it ! - Well, believe it now, motherfucker !

1490
01:56:31,640 --> 01:56:34,680
We gotta get this car off the road. Cops notice shit like a car drenched in blood.

1491
01:56:34,680 --> 01:56:35,100
- Just take it to a friendly place, that's all ! - This is the Valley, Vincent.
We gotta get this car off the road. Cops notice shit like a car drenched in blood.

1492
01:56:35,100 --> 01:56:37,610
- Just take it to a friendly place, that's all ! - This is the Valley, Vincent.

1493
01:56:37,680 --> 01:56:40,110
Marsellus ain't got no friendly places in the Valley.

1494
01:56:40,180 --> 01:56:43,120
- Well, Jules, this ain't my fuckin' town, man ! - Shit !

1495
01:56:43,190 --> 01:56:46,120
- What you doing ? - I'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake.

1496
01:56:46,190 --> 01:56:49,720
-Where's Toluca Lake ? -Over the hill here, by Burbank Studios.

1497
01:56:49,790 --> 01:56:52,730
If Jimmie's ass ain't home, I don't know what the fuck we gonna do,

1498
01:56:52,790 --> 01:56:55,730
'cause I ain't got no other partners in 818.

1499
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:58,730
Jimmie, how you doin', man ? It's Jules. Just listen up, man.

1500
01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:02,740
Me and my homeboy are in a car, and we gotta get it off the road, pronto.

1501
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:05,000
I need to use your garage for a couple hours.

1502
01:57:07,010 --> 01:57:09,940
We gotta be real fuckin' delicate with this Jimmie situation.

1503
01:57:10,010 --> 01:57:13,640
He's one remark away from kickin' our asses out the door.

1504
01:57:13,720 --> 01:57:16,650
- If he does, what do we do ? - We ain't leavin' 'til we make a couple calls,

1505
01:57:16,720 --> 01:57:19,650
but I don't want it to reach that pitch-- Jimmie's a friend.

1506
01:57:19,720 --> 01:57:22,660
You don't come into your friend's house and start tellin' him what's what.

1507
01:57:22,720 --> 01:57:24,660
Just tell him not to be abusive.

1508
01:57:24,730 --> 01:57:26,660
He kinda freaked out back there when he saw Marvin.

1509
01:57:26,730 --> 01:57:29,890
Put yourself in his position-- It's 8:00 in the morning, he just woke up.

1510
01:57:29,960 --> 01:57:31,900
He wasn't expectin' this shit.

1511
01:57:31,970 --> 01:57:34,900
We gotta remember here who's doin' who a favor.

1512
01:57:34,970 --> 01:57:38,910
If that favor means I gotta take shit, he can stick that favor straight up his ass.

1513
01:57:39,270 --> 01:57:43,210
- Fuck, nigger, what the fuck'd you just do to his towel, man ? - I was dryin' my hands !

1514
01:57:43,280 --> 01:57:46,210
- You're supposed to wash 'em first ! - You watched me wash 'em.

1515
01:57:46,280 --> 01:57:49,840
- I watched you get 'em wet. - I was washin' 'em. This shit's hard to get off.

1516
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:51,850
Maybe if he'd had Lava I coulda done a better job.

1517
01:57:51,920 --> 01:57:53,850
I used the same fuckin' soap you did,

1518
01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:56,860
and when I finished, the towel didn't look like no goddamn maxi-pad !

1519
01:57:56,920 --> 01:57:59,860
What if he was to come in here and see his towel like this ?

1520
01:57:59,930 --> 01:58:04,020
It's shit like this that's gonna bring this situation to a head, man !

1521
01:58:04,100 --> 01:58:07,530
Look, I ain't threatenin' you or nothin', all right ?

1522
01:58:07,600 --> 01:58:12,060
You know I respect you and all. But just don't put me in this position, all right ?

1523
01:58:12,140 --> 01:58:14,840
All right. Fine. Fine.

1524
01:58:14,910 --> 01:58:17,840
Ask me nice like that, no problem.

1525
01:58:17,910 --> 01:58:20,850
Just go handle your friend. Go ahead. I don't care.

1526
01:58:22,580 --> 01:58:25,450
Mmm ! Goddamn, Jimmie !

1527
01:58:25,520 --> 01:58:27,610
This some serious gourmet shit.

1528
01:58:27,690 --> 01:58:29,620
Me and Vincent would've been satisfied...

1529
01:58:29,690 --> 01:58:31,660
with some freeze-dried Taster's Choice.

1530
01:58:31,730 --> 01:58:33,660
Right ?

1531
01:58:33,730 --> 01:58:36,660
And he springs this serious gourmet shit on us.

1532
01:58:36,730 --> 01:58:38,790
- What flavor is this ? - Knock it off, Julie.

1533
01:58:38,870 --> 01:58:42,880
- What ? - I don't need you to tell me how fuckin' good my coffee is.

1534
01:58:42,970 --> 01:58:45,460
I'm the one who buys it. I know how good it is.

1535
01:58:45,540 --> 01:58:47,470
When Bonnie goes shopping, she buys shit.

1536
01:58:47,540 --> 01:58:51,160
I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause when I drink it, I wanna taste it.

1537
01:58:51,250 --> 01:58:55,170
But you know what's on my mind right now ? It ain't the coffee in my kitchen.

1538
01:58:55,250 --> 01:58:57,410
It's the dead nigger in my garage.

1539
01:58:57,490 --> 01:59:00,910
- Jimmie, don't even worry-- - Don't tell me about anything. I wanna ask you a question.

1540
01:59:00,990 --> 01:59:02,910
When you came pulling in here,

1541
01:59:02,990 --> 01:59:06,180
did you notice the sign on the front of my house that said, "Dead Nigger Storage" ?

1542
01:59:06,250 --> 01:59:09,690
- You know I ain't seen no-- - Did you notice the sign on the front of my house...

1543
01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:11,690
that said, "Dead Nigger Storage" ?

1544
01:59:11,770 --> 01:59:14,490
No. I didn't.

1545
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:17,490
- You know why you didn't see that sign ? - Why ?

1546
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:22,090
'Cause it ain't there, 'cause storing dead niggers ain't my fuckin' business, that's why !

1547
01:59:22,170 --> 01:59:25,100
- We're not gonna store the motherfucker-- - Don't you fuckin' realize...

1548
01:59:25,170 --> 01:59:29,610
that if Bonnie comes home and finds a dead body in her house, I'm gonna get divorced ?

1549
01:59:29,670 --> 01:59:32,910
No marriage counselor. No trial separation. I'm gonna get fuckin' divorced.

1550
01:59:32,980 --> 01:59:36,340
Okay ? And I don't wanna get fuckin' divorced !

1551
01:59:36,410 --> 01:59:41,410
Man, you know, fuck, I wanna help you, but I don't wanna lose my wife doin' it.

1552
01:59:41,490 --> 01:59:43,580
Jimmie, Jimmie, she ain't gonna leave you.

1553
01:59:43,650 --> 01:59:47,590
Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me, Jules ! Okay ? Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me.

1554
01:59:47,660 --> 01:59:51,620
There's nothin' you're gonna say that's gonna make me forget I love my wife. Is there ?

1555
01:59:54,770 --> 01:59:59,430
Now, look, you know, she comes home from work in about an hour and a half.

1556
01:59:59,500 --> 02:00:02,560
The graveyard shift at the hospital.

1557
02:00:02,640 --> 02:00:05,700
You gotta make some phone calls ? You gotta call some people ?

1558
02:00:05,780 --> 02:00:09,710
Well, then, do it, and then get the fuck out of my house before she gets here.

1559
02:00:09,780 --> 02:00:12,720
That's Kool and the Gang. We don't wanna fuck your shit up.

1560
02:00:12,780 --> 02:00:15,750
All I wanna do is call my people and get 'em to bring us in.

1561
02:00:15,820 --> 02:00:18,760
You're fucking my shit up right now !

1562
02:00:18,820 --> 02:00:21,920
You're gonna fuck my shit up big time if Bonnie comes home.

1563
02:00:21,990 --> 02:00:25,490
Do me that favor, all right ? The phone is in my bedroom. I suggest you get going.

1564
02:00:25,560 --> 02:00:28,500
Well, say she comes home.

1565
02:00:28,570 --> 02:00:31,000
What do you think she'll do ?

1566
02:00:32,500 --> 02:00:34,940
Oh, no fuckin' shit she'll freak.

1567
02:00:35,010 --> 02:00:37,200
That ain't no kinda answer.

1568
02:00:37,270 --> 02:00:40,330
I mean, you know, I don't. How much ? A lot or a little ?

1569
02:00:40,410 --> 02:00:43,280
You got to appreciate what an explosive element...

1570
02:00:43,350 --> 02:00:45,280
this Bonnie situation is.

1571
02:00:45,350 --> 02:00:49,290
She comes home from a hard day's work, finds a bunch of gangsters in her kitchen...

1572
02:00:49,350 --> 02:00:51,290
doing a bunch of gangster shit,

1573
02:00:51,360 --> 02:00:54,420
there ain't no tellin' what she's liable to do.

1574
02:00:56,590 --> 02:00:58,530
Yeah, I grasp that, Jules.

1575
02:00:58,600 --> 02:01:01,190
All I'm doing is contemplating the ifs.

1576
02:01:01,270 --> 02:01:04,200
I don't wanna hear about no motherfuckin' ifs !

1577
02:01:04,270 --> 02:01:08,200
All I want to hear from your ass is, "You ain't got no problem, Jules. I'm on the motherfucker.

1578
02:01:08,270 --> 02:01:12,440
Chill them niggers out and wait for the cavalry, which should be coming directly."

1579
02:01:12,510 --> 02:01:15,670
You ain't got no problem, Jules.

1580
02:01:15,750 --> 02:01:17,870
I'm on the motherfucker.

1581
02:01:17,950 --> 02:01:23,010
Chill them niggers out and wait for the Wolf, who should be coming directly.

1582
02:01:23,090 --> 02:01:25,520
You sendin' the Wolf ?

1583
02:01:25,590 --> 02:01:27,780
Oh, you feel better, motherfucker ?

1584
02:01:27,860 --> 02:01:30,120
Shit, yeah, negro !

1585
02:01:30,190 --> 02:01:33,320
That's all you had to say !

1586
02:01:33,400 --> 02:01:36,580
- She the hysterical type ?

1587
02:01:36,670 --> 02:01:39,600
- When is she due ?

1588
02:01:39,670 --> 02:01:41,760
Mm-hmm.

1589
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:43,760
Give me the principals' names again.

1590
02:01:43,840 --> 02:01:45,780
Place your bets.

1591
02:01:46,840 --> 02:01:50,500
- Jules. Mm-hmm. - Cards, please.

1592
02:01:50,580 --> 02:01:52,520
Vincent.

1593
02:01:57,250 --> 02:01:59,180
Jimmie.

1594
02:02:00,410 --> 02:02:02,540
Bonnie. Mm-hmm.

1595
02:02:07,970 --> 02:02:11,050
It's thirty minutes away. I'll be there in ten.

1596
02:02:27,870 --> 02:02:30,800
You're... Jimmie, right ? This is your house ?

1597
02:02:30,870 --> 02:02:34,500
- It sure is. - I'm Winston Wolf. I solve problems.

1598
02:02:34,580 --> 02:02:37,510
- Good. We got one. - So I heard. May I come in ?

1599
02:02:37,580 --> 02:02:39,510
Uh, yeah. Please do.

1600
02:02:39,580 --> 02:02:43,240
You must be Jules. Which would make you... Vincent.

1601
02:02:43,320 --> 02:02:45,750
Let's get down to brass tacks, gentlemen.

1602
02:02:45,820 --> 02:02:48,760
If I was informed correctly, the clock is ticking. Is that right, Jimmie ?

1603
02:02:48,820 --> 02:02:50,760
Uh, one hundred percent.

1604
02:02:50,830 --> 02:02:54,760
- Your wife Bonnie comes home at 9:30 in the a.m., correct ? - Uh-huh.

1605
02:02:54,830 --> 02:02:59,320
I was led to believe if she comes home and finds us here, she wouldn't appreciate it much.

1606
02:02:59,400 --> 02:03:03,700
- She wouldn't at that. - That gives us 40 minutes to get the fuck outta Dodge,

1607
02:03:03,770 --> 02:03:07,210
which, if you do what I say, when I say it, should be plenty.

1608
02:03:07,280 --> 02:03:11,610
Now, you got a corpse in a car, minus a head, in a garage. Take me to it.

1609
02:03:19,350 --> 02:03:21,290
- Jimmie. - Uh-huh.

1610
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:24,790
Do me a favor, will ya ? Thought I smelled some coffee back there.

1611
02:03:24,860 --> 02:03:28,300
- Would you make me a cup ? - Uh, yeah, sure.

1612
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:32,700
Oh, uh, um, how do you take it ?

1613
02:03:32,770 --> 02:03:35,330
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

1614
02:03:37,410 --> 02:03:40,840
About the car, is there anything I need to know ? Does it stall ?

1615
02:03:40,910 --> 02:03:44,350
Does it smoke ? Does it make a lot of noise ? ls there gas in it ?

1616
02:03:44,410 --> 02:03:47,850
- Aside from how it looks, the car's cool. - Positive ?

1617
02:03:47,920 --> 02:03:51,350
Don't get me on the road and I find out the brake lights don't work.

1618
02:03:51,420 --> 02:03:55,480
- As far as I know, the motherfucker's tip-top. - Good enough.

1619
02:03:55,560 --> 02:03:57,580
Let's go back to the kitchen.

1620
02:04:03,230 --> 02:04:06,170
- Here you go, Mr. Wolf. - Thank you, Jimmie.

1621
02:04:11,010 --> 02:04:12,940
Mmm.

1622
02:04:14,010 --> 02:04:16,140
Okay, first thing. You two.

1623
02:04:16,210 --> 02:04:19,150
Take the body, stick it in the trunk.

1624
02:04:19,210 --> 02:04:21,940
This looks to be a pretty domesticated house.

1625
02:04:22,020 --> 02:04:25,950
- That would lead me to believe you got cleansers and shit. - Yeah. Under the sink.

1626
02:04:26,020 --> 02:04:29,450
Good. What I need you two fellas to do is take those cleaning products...

1627
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:33,550
and clean the inside of the car-- I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast.

1628
02:04:33,630 --> 02:04:37,560
Go in the back seat, scoop up all those little pieces of brain and skull.

1629
02:04:37,630 --> 02:04:40,570
Get it out of there. Wipe down the upholstery.

1630
02:04:40,640 --> 02:04:43,560
It don't need to be spick-and-span. You don't need to eat off it.

1631
02:04:43,640 --> 02:04:48,000
Just give it a good once-over. What you need to take care of are the really messy parts.

1632
02:04:48,080 --> 02:04:52,160
The pools of blood that have collected, you gotta soak that shit up.

1633
02:04:52,250 --> 02:04:54,670
We need to raid your linen closet.

1634
02:04:54,750 --> 02:04:57,670
I need blankets, I need comforters, quilts, bedspreads.

1635
02:04:57,750 --> 02:05:01,370
The thicker the better, the darker the better. No whites. Can't use 'em.

1636
02:05:01,450 --> 02:05:06,750
We'll need to camouflage the front seat and back seat and floorboards...

1637
02:05:06,830 --> 02:05:08,750
with quilts and blankets,

1638
02:05:08,830 --> 02:05:12,760
so if a cop starts stickin' his big snout in the car, the subterfuge won't last,

1639
02:05:12,820 --> 02:05:15,690
but at a glance the car will appear to be normal.

1640
02:05:15,760 --> 02:05:17,820
Jimmie, lead the way. Boys, get to work.

1641
02:05:17,900 --> 02:05:19,660
"Please" would be nice.

1642
02:05:21,130 --> 02:05:24,070
- Come again ? - I said, a "please" would be nice.

1643
02:05:25,970 --> 02:05:29,800
Get it straight, buster. I'm not here to say please. I'm here to tell you what to do.

1644
02:05:31,610 --> 02:05:34,540
And if self-preservation is an instinct you possess,

1645
02:05:34,610 --> 02:05:37,050
you'd better fuckin' do it and do it quick.

1646
02:05:37,120 --> 02:05:41,020
I'm here to help. If my help's not appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen.

1647
02:05:41,090 --> 02:05:44,420
No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that; your help is definitely appreciated.

1648
02:05:44,490 --> 02:05:47,420
Mr. Wolf, listen. I don't mean disrespect, okay ? I respect you.

1649
02:05:47,490 --> 02:05:50,290
I just don't like people barkin' orders at me.

1650
02:05:50,360 --> 02:05:53,420
If I'm curt with you, it's because time is a factor.

1651
02:05:53,500 --> 02:05:58,130
I think fast, I talk fast, and I need you guys to act fast if you wanna get out of this.

1652
02:05:58,200 --> 02:06:01,640
So pretty please, with sugar on top, clean the fuckin' car.

1653
02:06:06,140 --> 02:06:09,810
Don't be lookin' at me like that, all right ? I can feel your look.

1654
02:06:12,520 --> 02:06:15,210
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.

1655
02:06:17,290 --> 02:06:19,220
Green.

1656
02:06:20,830 --> 02:06:23,760
Nothin' except for the mess inside.

1657
02:06:25,960 --> 02:06:28,400
Mmm, about 20 minutes.

1658
02:06:29,900 --> 02:06:31,840
Nobody who'll be missed.

1659
02:06:33,910 --> 02:06:36,840
You're a good man, Joe. Thanks a bunch.

1660
02:06:37,940 --> 02:06:39,880
- How we comin', Jimmie ? - Pretty good.

1661
02:06:39,940 --> 02:06:43,110
- I got it all here, but, uh,

1662
02:06:43,180 --> 02:06:46,620
- Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand something. - Winston, Jimmie, Winston.

1663
02:06:46,680 --> 02:06:50,210
Okay. You gotta understand something, uh, Winston.

1664
02:06:50,290 --> 02:06:52,220
Uh-- Uh, no, thank you.

1665
02:06:52,290 --> 02:06:55,420
Uh, this is our best linen here,

1666
02:06:55,490 --> 02:06:58,430
and it's, uh-- it was a wedding present...

1667
02:06:58,500 --> 02:07:00,930
from my Uncle Conrad and my Aunt Ginny.

1668
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:05,440
- They're not with us anymore. I wanna help-- - Let me ask you a question.

1669
02:07:05,500 --> 02:07:08,440
- If you don't mind. - No, no, please. Go ahead.

1670
02:07:10,010 --> 02:07:14,910
Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, were they millionaires ?

1671
02:07:16,050 --> 02:07:17,980
No.

1672
02:07:18,050 --> 02:07:20,480
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is.

1673
02:07:20,550 --> 02:07:24,010
And I'm positive that if Uncle Conrad and Aunt...

1674
02:07:24,090 --> 02:07:26,520
- Ginny. - Ginny were here,

1675
02:07:26,590 --> 02:07:30,850
they would furnish you with a whole bedroom set,

1676
02:07:30,930 --> 02:07:34,050
which your Uncle Marsellus is more than happy to do.

1677
02:07:38,040 --> 02:07:41,960
I like oak myself. That's what I have in my bedroom.

1678
02:07:43,110 --> 02:07:45,030
How about you, Jimmie ?

1679
02:07:46,280 --> 02:07:48,210
You an oak man ?

1680
02:07:49,310 --> 02:07:51,250
Oak's nice.

1681
02:07:57,080 --> 02:08:00,950
Oh, man, I will never forgive your ass for this shit.

1682
02:08:01,020 --> 02:08:03,450
This is some fucked-up, repugnant shit.

1683
02:08:03,530 --> 02:08:06,950
Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy that once a man admits he is wrong...

1684
02:08:07,030 --> 02:08:09,960
that he is immediately forgiven for all wrongdoings ?

1685
02:08:10,020 --> 02:08:12,960
Get the fuck out my face with that shit !

1686
02:08:13,030 --> 02:08:15,890
The motherfucker that said that shit never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces of skull...

1687
02:08:15,960 --> 02:08:19,730
- on account of your dumb ass. - I got a threshold, Jules, for the abuse that I will take.

1688
02:08:19,800 --> 02:08:23,400
Right now, I'm a fuckin' race car, and you got me in the red.

1689
02:08:23,470 --> 02:08:26,910
I'm just sayin' it's fuckin' dangerous to have a race car in the fuckin' red.

1690
02:08:26,970 --> 02:08:28,910
That's all. I could blow.

1691
02:08:28,980 --> 02:08:30,910
- Oh, you ready to blow ? - Yeah.

1692
02:08:30,980 --> 02:08:33,910
Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker, motherfucker.

1693
02:08:33,980 --> 02:08:36,920
Every time my fingers touch brain, I'm Superfly T.N.T.

1694
02:08:36,980 --> 02:08:38,920
I'm the Guns of the Navarone.

1695
02:08:38,990 --> 02:08:41,920
In fact, what the fuck am I doin' in the back ?

1696
02:08:41,990 --> 02:08:45,220
You're the motherfucker should be on brain detail ! We're fuckin' switchin'.

1697
02:08:45,290 --> 02:08:47,730
I'm washin' windows, and you're pickin' up this nigger's skull !

1698
02:08:57,510 --> 02:08:59,440
Fine job, gentlemen.

1699
02:09:00,780 --> 02:09:03,210
You may get out of this yet.

1700
02:09:03,280 --> 02:09:05,710
I can't believe this is the same car.

1701
02:09:05,780 --> 02:09:09,220
Well, let's not start suckin' each other's dicks quite yet.

1702
02:09:09,280 --> 02:09:12,720
Phase one is complete-- Clean the car-- which moves us right along to Phase two:

1703
02:09:12,790 --> 02:09:14,720
Clean you two.

1704
02:09:16,290 --> 02:09:18,160
Strip.

1705
02:09:18,230 --> 02:09:21,990
- All the way ? - To your bare ass.

1706
02:09:22,060 --> 02:09:25,160
Quickly, gentlemen. We got about 15 minutes...

1707
02:09:25,230 --> 02:09:28,170
before Jimmie's better half comes pulling into the driveway.

1708
02:09:28,240 --> 02:09:30,730
Goddamn, this morning air is some chilly shit.

1709
02:09:30,810 --> 02:09:32,760
Are you sure this is absolutely necessary ?

1710
02:09:32,890 --> 02:09:35,190
- You know what you two look like ? - What ?

1711
02:09:35,260 --> 02:09:38,700
Like a couple of guys who just blew off somebody's head.

1712
02:09:38,760 --> 02:09:42,130
Strippin' off those bloody rags is absolutely necessary.

1713
02:09:46,440 --> 02:09:48,910
Toss 'em in Jimmie's garbage bag.

1714
02:09:48,970 --> 02:09:53,410
Don't do nothin' stupid, like leavin' this shit out front for the garbageman to pick up.

1715
02:09:53,480 --> 02:09:57,710
Don't worry, we're taking it with us. Jim, the soap.

1716
02:09:59,150 --> 02:10:01,090
- Vincent. - Okay, gentlemen.

1717
02:10:01,150 --> 02:10:04,650
You both been to County before, I'm sure. Here it comes.

1718
02:10:04,720 --> 02:10:07,660
- Goddamn ! The water's fuckin' cold ! - Yo ! Yo ! Yo !

1719
02:10:07,730 --> 02:10:10,960
Better you than me, gentlemen.

1720
02:10:11,030 --> 02:10:13,970
- Don't be afraid of the soap. Spread it around.

1721
02:10:14,030 --> 02:10:16,900
- Get 'em there a little bit. Vincent's hair. - Hey, get out of my hair !

1722
02:10:16,970 --> 02:10:19,870
- Come on. Do it, goddamn it ! Do it ! - Uh, um--

1723
02:10:20,940 --> 02:10:22,870
Towel.

1724
02:10:33,390 --> 02:10:36,540
You're dry enough. Toss 'em their clothes.

1725
02:10:36,620 --> 02:10:39,880
Perfect.

1726
02:10:39,960 --> 02:10:43,410
Perfect. We couldn't have planned this better.

1727
02:10:43,500 --> 02:10:45,430
You guys look like--

1728
02:10:45,500 --> 02:10:47,930
What do they look like, Jimmie ?

1729
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:51,590
- Dorks. They look like a couple of dorks.

1730
02:10:51,670 --> 02:10:55,150
- Ha-ha-ha. They're your clothes, motherfucker.

1731
02:10:55,230 --> 02:10:57,960
Come on, gentlemen. We're laughing our way right into prison.

1732
02:10:58,030 --> 02:10:59,970
Don't make me beg.

1733
02:11:03,050 --> 02:11:06,470
Okay, gentlemen, let's get our rules of the road straight.

1734
02:11:06,550 --> 02:11:10,100
We're going to a place called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.

1735
02:11:10,180 --> 02:11:13,110
Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel are sympathetic to our dilemma.

1736
02:11:13,180 --> 02:11:15,080
The place is North Hollywood,

1737
02:11:15,150 --> 02:11:19,140
so a few twists and turns aside, we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way.

1738
02:11:19,220 --> 02:11:22,550
Now, I'll drive the tainted car. Jules, you ride with me.

1739
02:11:23,960 --> 02:11:25,890
Vincent, you follow in my Acura.

1740
02:11:25,960 --> 02:11:29,900
Now, if we come across the path of any John Q. Laws,

1741
02:11:29,970 --> 02:11:33,060
- nobody does a fuckin' thing 'til I do something. - Right.

1742
02:11:33,140 --> 02:11:36,070
- What did I say ? - Don't do shit unless.

1743
02:11:36,140 --> 02:11:38,400
- Unless what ? - Unless you do it first.

1744
02:11:38,470 --> 02:11:40,910
Spoken like a true prodigy.

1745
02:11:40,980 --> 02:11:44,410
How about you, Lash LaRue ? Can you keep your spurs from jingling and jangling ?

1746
02:11:44,480 --> 02:11:48,580
The gun went off. I don't know why. I'm cool. I promise you.

1747
02:11:48,650 --> 02:11:51,590
Fair enough. Now, I drive real fuckin' fast, so keep up.

1748
02:11:51,650 --> 02:11:54,150
If get my car back any different than I gave it,

1749
02:11:54,220 --> 02:11:57,160
Monster Joe's gonna be disposing of two bodies.

1750
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:02,690
Outta my way, Rex.

1751
02:12:04,270 --> 02:12:06,700
- We cool ? - Like it never happened.

1752
02:12:06,770 --> 02:12:10,540
- All right. - Boys, this is Raquel.

1753
02:12:10,610 --> 02:12:13,230
Someday all this will be hers.

1754
02:12:13,310 --> 02:12:16,180
Hi. So, what's with the outfits ?

1755
02:12:16,250 --> 02:12:19,680
- You guys going to a volleyball game or something ?

1756
02:12:19,750 --> 02:12:22,180
I'm takin' milady out for breakfast.

1757
02:12:22,250 --> 02:12:25,020
Maybe I could drop you two off. Where do you live ?

1758
02:12:25,090 --> 02:12:26,450
- Redondo. - Inglewood.

1759
02:12:26,520 --> 02:12:29,960
It's-- It's your future. I--

1760
02:12:30,030 --> 02:12:32,790
I see a-- a cab ride.

1761
02:12:32,860 --> 02:12:35,830
Move outta the sticks, fellas. Say good night, Raquel.

1762
02:12:35,900 --> 02:12:38,830
- Good night, Raquel. - I'll see you guys around.

1763
02:12:38,900 --> 02:12:41,340
Stay outta trouble, you crazy kids.

1764
02:12:41,400 --> 02:12:45,340
Mr. Wolf, I just wanna tell you it was a real pleasure watching you work.

1765
02:12:45,410 --> 02:12:48,340
Yeah, really. And thank you very much, Mr. Wolf.

1766
02:12:48,410 --> 02:12:50,340
Call me Winston.

1767
02:12:51,910 --> 02:12:54,850
- You see that, young lady ? Respect.

1768
02:12:54,920 --> 02:12:59,120
- Respect for one's elders shows character. - I have character.

1769
02:12:59,190 --> 02:13:03,220
- Because you are a character doesn't mean that you have character.

1770
02:13:09,800 --> 02:13:12,730
- Wanna share a cab ?

1771
02:13:12,800 --> 02:13:17,070
- I'd go for some breakfast. Feel like havin' breakfast with me ?

1772
02:13:17,140 --> 02:13:19,940
Cool.

1773
02:13:23,980 --> 02:13:27,070
I don't know why, I just thought he'd be European or something.

1774
02:13:27,150 --> 02:13:30,580
- Yeah, he's about as European as fuckin' English Bob. - I know that now.

1775
02:13:30,650 --> 02:13:33,090
- But was he cool or what ? - Thank you.

1776
02:13:33,160 --> 02:13:35,590
Totally fuckin' cool, in control.

1777
02:13:35,660 --> 02:13:39,710
Didn't even really get pissed when you were fuckin' with him; I was amazed.

1778
02:13:39,800 --> 02:13:42,380
- Want some bacon ?

1779
02:13:42,460 --> 02:13:44,400
No, man, I don't eat pork.

1780
02:13:44,470 --> 02:13:47,890
- Are you Jewish ? - I ain't Jewish; I just don't dig on swine, that's all.

1781
02:13:47,970 --> 02:13:50,900
- Why not ? - Pigs are filthy animals.

1782
02:13:50,970 --> 02:13:52,900
I don't eat filthy animals.

1783
02:13:52,980 --> 02:13:56,400
Yeah, but bacon tastes good. Pork chops taste good.

1784
02:13:56,470 --> 02:13:59,400
Sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie, but I'd never know...

1785
02:13:59,480 --> 02:14:02,410
'cause I wouldn't eat the filthy motherfuckers.

1786
02:14:02,470 --> 02:14:05,410
Pigs sleep and root in shit. That's a filthy animal.

1787
02:14:05,480 --> 02:14:09,410
I ain't eatin' nothin' ain't got sense enough to disregard its own feces.

1788
02:14:09,480 --> 02:14:13,820
- What about a dog ? Dog eats its own feces. - I don't eat dog either.

1789
02:14:13,890 --> 02:14:17,220
Yeah, but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal ?

1790
02:14:17,290 --> 02:14:20,220
I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy,

1791
02:14:20,290 --> 02:14:22,230
but they're definitely dirty.

1792
02:14:22,290 --> 02:14:26,420
- But a dog's got personality. Personality goes a long way. - Ah, so, by that rationale,

1793
02:14:26,500 --> 02:14:30,060
if a pig had a better personality, he would cease to be a filthy animal.

1794
02:14:30,140 --> 02:14:34,070
- Is that true ? - We'd have to be talkin' about one charming motherfuckin' pig.

1795
02:14:34,140 --> 02:14:38,170
I mean, he'd have to be ten times more charming than that Arnold on Green Acres.

1796
02:14:43,780 --> 02:14:45,910
Oh, man, that's good.

1797
02:14:45,980 --> 02:14:49,580
That's good, man. You're startin' to lighten up.

1798
02:14:49,660 --> 02:14:52,650
You've been sittin' there, all serious and shit.

1799
02:14:52,730 --> 02:14:55,160
- I just been sittin' here, thinkin'. - About what ?

1800
02:14:55,230 --> 02:14:58,160
- About the miracle we witnessed. - Miracle you witnessed.

1801
02:14:58,230 --> 02:15:01,500
- I witnessed a freak occurrence. - What is a miracle, Vincent ?

1802
02:15:03,400 --> 02:15:06,600
- Act of God. - And what's an act of God ?

1803
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:13,910
When, um, God makes the impossible possible.

1804
02:15:14,950 --> 02:15:16,880
But this morning...

1805
02:15:16,950 --> 02:15:19,680
- I don't think qualifies. - Hey, Vincent.

1806
02:15:19,750 --> 02:15:23,450
See, that shit don't matter. You're judging this shit the wrong way.

1807
02:15:23,520 --> 02:15:28,460
It could be God stopped the bullets, changed Coke to Pepsi, found my car keys.

1808
02:15:28,530 --> 02:15:31,520
You don't judge shit like this based on merit.

1809
02:15:31,600 --> 02:15:34,030
Now, whether or not what we experienced...

1810
02:15:34,100 --> 02:15:37,260
was an according-to-Hoyle miracle is insignificant.

1811
02:15:37,340 --> 02:15:41,100
But what is significant is, I felt the touch of God.

1812
02:15:41,170 --> 02:15:43,110
God got involved.

1813
02:15:43,180 --> 02:15:44,900
But why ?

1814
02:15:44,980 --> 02:15:48,000
Well, that's what's fuckin' with me: I don't know why.

1815
02:15:48,080 --> 02:15:51,050
- But I can't go back to sleep. - You're serious.

1816
02:15:51,120 --> 02:15:53,050
You're really thinkin' about quittin'.

1817
02:15:53,120 --> 02:15:55,780
- For life ? Most definitely. - Yeah.

1818
02:15:55,850 --> 02:15:59,220
Fuck. What you gonna do then ?

1819
02:16:00,530 --> 02:16:04,760
Well, that's what I been sitting here contemplating.

1820
02:16:04,830 --> 02:16:08,430
First I'm gonna deliver this case to Marsellus.

1821
02:16:08,500 --> 02:16:11,590
Then, basically, I'm just gonna walk the Earth.

1822
02:16:11,670 --> 02:16:15,110
- What you mean, "walk the Earth" ? - Like Caine in Kung Fu.

1823
02:16:15,170 --> 02:16:18,140
Walk from place to place, meet people, get in adventures.

1824
02:16:18,210 --> 02:16:20,470
And how long do you intend to walk the Earth ?

1825
02:16:20,550 --> 02:16:23,840
- 'Til God puts me where He wants me to be. - What if He don't do that ?

1826
02:16:23,920 --> 02:16:28,850
- If it takes forever, then I'll walk forever. - So you decided to be a bum.

1827
02:16:28,920 --> 02:16:32,570
I'll just be Jules, Vincent. No more, no less.

1828
02:16:32,660 --> 02:16:34,630
No, Jules, you decided to be a bum,

1829
02:16:34,690 --> 02:16:37,980
just like all those pieces of shit out there who beg for change,

1830
02:16:38,060 --> 02:16:40,990
who sleep in garbage bins, eat what I throw away.

1831
02:16:41,070 --> 02:16:44,040
They got a name for that, Jules. It's called a bum.

1832
02:16:44,100 --> 02:16:47,760
And without a job, a residence or legal tender, that's what you're gonna be, man.

1833
02:16:47,840 --> 02:16:49,760
You're gonna be a fuckin' bum.

1834
02:16:49,840 --> 02:16:52,770
Look, my friend, this is just where you and I differ.

1835
02:16:52,840 --> 02:16:55,670
GarÃ§on ! Coffee !

1836
02:16:55,740 --> 02:17:00,230
Jules, look, what happened this morning, man, I agree it was peculiar.

1837
02:17:00,320 --> 02:17:03,440
- But water into wine, l-- - All shapes and sizes, Vincent.

1838
02:17:03,520 --> 02:17:06,610
- Don't fuckin' talk to me that way, man. - If my answers frighten you,

1839
02:17:06,680 --> 02:17:09,280
then you should cease asking scary questions.

1840
02:17:12,150 --> 02:17:14,090
I'm gonna take a shit.

1841
02:17:16,960 --> 02:17:20,710
Let me ask you something.

1842
02:17:20,840 --> 02:17:22,970
When did you make this decision ? When you were sittin' there eatin' that muffin ?

1843
02:17:23,040 --> 02:17:26,980
Yeah. I was sittin' here eatin' my muffin, drinkin' my coffee,

1844
02:17:27,050 --> 02:17:28,980
replayin' the incident in my head,

1845
02:17:29,050 --> 02:17:32,850
when I had what alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity.

1846
02:17:32,920 --> 02:17:36,050
Fuck. To be continued.

1847
02:17:48,070 --> 02:17:51,000
- I love you, Pumpkin. - I love you, Honey Bunny.

1848
02:17:52,610 --> 02:17:55,540
- Everybody be cool ! This is a robbery !

1849
02:17:55,610 --> 02:18:00,600
Any one of you fucking pricks move, and I'll execute every one of you motherfuckers !

1850
02:18:00,680 --> 02:18:04,080
- You got that ? You just be quiet over there ! - Waitresses on the floor !

1851
02:18:04,150 --> 02:18:07,210
Get on the fuckin'-- Get the fuck down !

1852
02:18:07,290 --> 02:18:12,020
You're in a blind spot. Take your dames over to that booth, on the count of ten !

1853
02:18:12,090 --> 02:18:16,660
- Mexicans, out of the fucking kitchen ! - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8--

1854
02:18:16,730 --> 02:18:19,830
What the fuck are you doing, you fucking yuppie ? Get down !

1855
02:18:19,900 --> 02:18:22,370
- Get down ! - Throw those bags !

1856
02:18:22,440 --> 02:18:24,930
- Fucking move ! Move !

1857
02:18:25,010 --> 02:18:27,270
- Move ! Get the fuck--

1858
02:18:27,340 --> 02:18:30,370
Get down on the fucking floor !

1859
02:18:30,450 --> 02:18:32,380
Grandpa ! Down !

1860
02:18:32,450 --> 02:18:35,810
I'm the manager here, and there's no problem. No problem at all.

1861
02:18:35,880 --> 02:18:38,820
- You gonna give me a problem ? - No, sir, I'm not.

1862
02:18:38,890 --> 02:18:42,910
Thought you said you were gonna give me a fucking problem !

1863
02:18:42,990 --> 02:18:47,690
- I think we got a hero here, Honey Bunny. - Well, just execute him !

1864
02:18:47,760 --> 02:18:49,700
- I am not a hero.

1865
02:18:49,760 --> 02:18:52,790
- I'm just a coffee shop manager. - Get the fuck down !

1866
02:18:52,870 --> 02:18:54,630
The restaurant's ours !

1867
02:18:54,700 --> 02:18:57,640
- Just take whatever you want.

1868
02:18:57,710 --> 02:18:59,640
- You talk to the customers. - Yeah.

1869
02:18:59,710 --> 02:19:02,840
You tell them to be fucking cool and everything will be over.

1870
02:19:02,910 --> 02:19:04,880
- You understand me ? - Yes !

1871
02:19:07,180 --> 02:19:08,980
Listen, everybody.

1872
02:19:09,050 --> 02:19:11,080
Be calm, cooperate,

1873
02:19:11,150 --> 02:19:14,090
and this'll all be over in a minute !

1874
02:19:14,160 --> 02:19:16,120
Get the fuck down ! Well done.

1875
02:19:28,470 --> 02:19:31,900
All right, now, people, gonna come around and collect your wallets !

1876
02:19:31,970 --> 02:19:35,420
You don't fucking talk. You just throw 'em in the bag ! Are we clear ?

1877
02:19:35,510 --> 02:19:37,730
I said, are we fucking clear ?

1878
02:19:37,810 --> 02:19:40,740
Good ! Now, wallets out !

1879
02:19:40,820 --> 02:19:44,400
That's it. Get the fuck down. In the bag.

1880
02:19:44,490 --> 02:19:47,410
- In the fucking bag ! - I don't have nothin' on me, man.

1881
02:19:47,490 --> 02:19:49,340
In the bag.

1882
02:19:49,420 --> 02:19:52,350
What am I waiting for ? ln the fucking bag.

1883
02:19:52,430 --> 02:19:55,350
Laura. Laura. Tips. In the bag.

1884
02:19:55,420 --> 02:19:57,650
- Is that a cellular phone ? - Yeah.

1885
02:19:57,730 --> 02:19:59,660
In the fucking bag.

1886
02:20:01,240 --> 02:20:04,680
Tidy up, tidy up, that's it. Now get the fuck down on the floor.

1887
02:20:04,760 --> 02:20:07,200
In the bag. In the bag.

1888
02:20:19,380 --> 02:20:21,310
In the bag.

1889
02:20:36,430 --> 02:20:39,360
- What's in the case ? - My boss's dirty laundry.

1890
02:20:39,430 --> 02:20:41,960
- Your boss makes you do his laundry ? - When he wants it clean.

1891
02:20:42,030 --> 02:20:44,730
- Sounds like a shit job. - Funny, I was thinkin' the same thing.

1892
02:20:44,800 --> 02:20:47,740
- Open it. - 'Fraid I can't do that.

1893
02:20:49,770 --> 02:20:52,140
- I didn't hear you. - Yes, you did.

1894
02:20:53,210 --> 02:20:55,540
What's going on ?

1895
02:20:55,610 --> 02:20:59,070
- Looks like we got a vigilante in our midst. - Shoot him in the face !

1896
02:20:59,150 --> 02:21:02,880
I hate to shatter your ego, but this ain't the first time I've had a gun pointed at me.

1897
02:21:02,950 --> 02:21:06,360
- If you don't take your hand off that case, it'll be your last. - Stop causing problems !

1898
02:21:06,420 --> 02:21:09,220
You'll get us all killed ! Give 'em what you got and get 'em outta here !

1899
02:21:09,290 --> 02:21:13,530
Shut the fuck up, fat man ! This ain't none of your goddamn business !

1900
02:21:13,600 --> 02:21:15,830
Be cool, Honey Bunny, be cool.

1901
02:21:15,900 --> 02:21:17,990
No problem. I got it under control.

1902
02:21:19,570 --> 02:21:21,560
Now, I'm gonna count to three.

1903
02:21:23,170 --> 02:21:27,110
If you don't open that case, I'm gonna unload in your fucking face.

1904
02:21:31,520 --> 02:21:33,450
We clear ?

1905
02:21:36,590 --> 02:21:38,520
One.

1906
02:21:40,360 --> 02:21:42,880
Two.

1907
02:21:42,960 --> 02:21:45,020
- Three. - Okay, Ringo.

1908
02:21:45,100 --> 02:21:47,160
You win.

1909
02:21:47,230 --> 02:21:49,170
It's yours.

1910
02:21:53,200 --> 02:21:55,930
- Open it.

1911
02:21:59,810 --> 02:22:02,040
Hey, what is it ?

1912
02:22:02,110 --> 02:22:04,450
What is it ?

1913
02:22:04,520 --> 02:22:07,110
Is that what I think it is ?

1914
02:22:07,180 --> 02:22:09,880
Mm-hmm.

1915
02:22:11,460 --> 02:22:13,580
It's beautiful.

1916
02:22:13,660 --> 02:22:16,220
Goddamn it, what is it ?

1917
02:22:17,700 --> 02:22:20,630
You let him go ! You let him go !

1918
02:22:20,700 --> 02:22:23,670
- Let go of him, or I'm gonna kill you ! - Tell that bitch to be cool.

1919
02:22:23,730 --> 02:22:26,670
- Say, "Bitch, be cool !" Say, "Bitch, be cool !" - Be cool ! Be cool !

1920
02:22:26,740 --> 02:22:29,470
- Tell that bitch to chill ! - You're gonna die so fuckin' bad !

1921
02:22:29,540 --> 02:22:32,440
- Chill that fuckin' bitch out ! - Chill out, Honey Bunny !

1922
02:22:32,510 --> 02:22:34,310
- Let go of him ! - Chill out, Honey Bunny !

1923
02:22:34,380 --> 02:22:37,300
- Now, promise her it's gonna be all right ! - I promise !

1924
02:22:37,380 --> 02:22:39,280
- Tell her to chill ! - Chill out, Honey Bunny !

1925
02:22:39,350 --> 02:22:41,280
- Now tell me her name. - Yolanda.

1926
02:22:41,350 --> 02:22:44,780
All right, now, Yolanda, we're not gonna do anything stupid, are we ?

1927
02:22:44,860 --> 02:22:47,780
- Don't you hurt him ! - Nobody's gonna hurt anybody !

1928
02:22:47,860 --> 02:22:51,340
We're all gonna be like three little Fonzies here. And what's Fonzie like ?

1929
02:22:51,430 --> 02:22:55,080
- Come on, Yolanda ! What's Fonzie like ? - He's cool.

1930
02:22:55,170 --> 02:22:57,090
- What ? - Cool.

1931
02:22:57,170 --> 02:22:59,990
Correctamundo. And that's what we're gonna be.

1932
02:23:00,070 --> 02:23:02,000
We're gonna be cool.

1933
02:23:02,060 --> 02:23:06,970
Now, Ringo, I'm gonna count to three.

1934
02:23:07,030 --> 02:23:09,130
And when I count three,

1935
02:23:09,200 --> 02:23:12,140
I want you to let go of your gun,

1936
02:23:12,210 --> 02:23:15,660
put your palms flat on the table and sit your ass down.

1937
02:23:16,740 --> 02:23:18,800
And when you do it,

1938
02:23:18,880 --> 02:23:20,940
you do it cool.

1939
02:23:21,020 --> 02:23:23,350
You ready ?

1940
02:23:23,420 --> 02:23:25,510
One,

1941
02:23:25,590 --> 02:23:27,780
two,

1942
02:23:27,860 --> 02:23:29,790
three.

1943
02:23:36,760 --> 02:23:39,890
- Okay, now you let him go ! - Yolanda !

1944
02:23:39,970 --> 02:23:43,560
I thought you were gonna be cool. Now, when you yell at me, it makes me nervous.

1945
02:23:43,640 --> 02:23:45,730
When I get nervous, I get scared.

1946
02:23:45,810 --> 02:23:49,640
When motherfuckers get scared, that's when motherfuckers accidentally get shot.

1947
02:23:51,280 --> 02:23:54,910
Just know, you hurt him, you die.

1948
02:23:54,980 --> 02:23:58,380
Well, that seems to be the situation.

1949
02:23:58,450 --> 02:24:00,390
But I don't want that.

1950
02:24:00,450 --> 02:24:02,390
And you don't want that.

1951
02:24:02,460 --> 02:24:05,190
And Ringo here definitely doesn't want that.

1952
02:24:05,260 --> 02:24:07,350
So let's see what we can do.

1953
02:24:09,760 --> 02:24:13,000
Now... here's the situation.

1954
02:24:13,070 --> 02:24:16,940
Normally both your asses would be dead as fuckin' fried chicken,

1955
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:20,440
but you happened to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period,

1956
02:24:20,510 --> 02:24:23,440
and I don't wanna kill you; I wanna help you.

1957
02:24:23,510 --> 02:24:27,450
But I can't give you this case, 'cause it don't belong to me.

1958
02:24:27,520 --> 02:24:30,450
Besides, I been through too much shit over this case this morning...

1959
02:24:30,520 --> 02:24:33,450
to just hand it over to your dumb ass.

1960
02:24:33,520 --> 02:24:35,390
- Vincent !

1961
02:24:35,460 --> 02:24:38,390
- Be cool ! Yolanda, it's cool, baby. - Get back !

1962
02:24:38,460 --> 02:24:41,160
It's cool ! We still just talkin'.

1963
02:24:41,230 --> 02:24:45,390
- Come on. Point the gun at me. Point the gun at me. There you go.

1964
02:24:45,470 --> 02:24:47,530
Now, Vincent, you just hang back...

1965
02:24:47,600 --> 02:24:49,540
and don't do a goddamn thing.

1966
02:24:49,600 --> 02:24:51,540
Tell her it's still cool.

1967
02:24:51,610 --> 02:24:54,540
- It's still cool, Honey Bunny. - How we doin', baby ?

1968
02:24:55,940 --> 02:24:58,610
I-- I gotta go pee.

1969
02:24:58,680 --> 02:25:00,610
I wanna go home.

1970
02:25:00,680 --> 02:25:04,280
Hang in there, baby. I'm proud of you. And Ringo's proud of you.

1971
02:25:04,350 --> 02:25:07,290
It's almost over. Tell her you're proud of her.

1972
02:25:07,350 --> 02:25:10,720
- I'm proud of you, Honey Bunny. - I love you.

1973
02:25:10,790 --> 02:25:13,950
- I love you too, Honey Bunny. - Now,

1974
02:25:14,030 --> 02:25:17,960
I want you to go in that bag and find my wallet.

1975
02:25:20,500 --> 02:25:24,430
- Which one is it ? - It's the one that says "Bad Motherfucker."

1976
02:25:38,700 --> 02:25:41,250
That's it. That's my bad motherfucker.

1977
02:25:41,330 --> 02:25:44,420
Open it up. Take out the money.

1978
02:25:49,480 --> 02:25:51,630
Count it.

1979
02:25:57,950 --> 02:26:00,470
How much is there ?

1980
02:26:02,380 --> 02:26:04,310
About 1,500 dollars.

1981
02:26:04,380 --> 02:26:07,580
Okay, put it in your pocket. It's yours.

1982
02:26:07,650 --> 02:26:10,850
Now, with the rest of those wallets and the register,

1983
02:26:10,920 --> 02:26:13,010
that makes this a pretty successful little score, huh ?

1984
02:26:13,090 --> 02:26:16,990
Jules, you give that fuckin' nimrod 1,500 dollars, and I'll shoot him on general principle.

1985
02:26:17,060 --> 02:26:20,500
No, Yolanda ! Yolanda ! He ain't gonna do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing !

1986
02:26:20,560 --> 02:26:22,660
Vince, shut the fuck up !

1987
02:26:22,730 --> 02:26:26,600
- Shut up ! - Come on, Yolanda. Stay with me, baby.

1988
02:26:26,670 --> 02:26:29,600
Now, I ain't givin' it to him, Vincent.

1989
02:26:29,670 --> 02:26:31,610
I'm buyin' something for my money.

1990
02:26:32,840 --> 02:26:36,040
- Wanna know what I'm buyin', Ringo ? - What ?

1991
02:26:36,110 --> 02:26:40,850
Your life. I'm givin' you that money so I don't have to kill your ass.

1992
02:26:40,920 --> 02:26:43,610
You read the Bible, Ringo ?

1993
02:26:44,690 --> 02:26:46,620
Not regularly, no.

1994
02:26:46,690 --> 02:26:49,120
Well, there's this passage I got memorized.

1995
02:26:49,190 --> 02:26:52,720
Ezekiel 25:17.

1996
02:26:52,800 --> 02:26:55,630
"The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides...

1997
02:26:55,700 --> 02:26:57,630
by the inequities of the selfish...

1998
02:26:57,700 --> 02:26:59,630
and the tyranny of evil men.

1999
02:26:59,700 --> 02:27:03,070
Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will,

2000
02:27:03,140 --> 02:27:05,570
shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,

2001
02:27:05,640 --> 02:27:09,740
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children.

2002
02:27:09,810 --> 02:27:14,110
And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger...

2003
02:27:14,180 --> 02:27:17,240
those who attempt to poison and destroy My brothers.

2004
02:27:17,320 --> 02:27:20,350
And you will know I am the Lord...

2005
02:27:20,420 --> 02:27:23,980
when I lay My vengeance upon you."

2006
02:27:25,060 --> 02:27:27,500
I been sayin' that shit for years,

2007
02:27:27,560 --> 02:27:30,730
and if you heard it, that meant your ass.

2008
02:27:30,800 --> 02:27:33,740
I never gave much thought to what it meant.

2009
02:27:33,800 --> 02:27:36,740
I just thought it was some coldblooded shit to say to a motherfucker...

2010
02:27:36,810 --> 02:27:39,240
before I popped a cap in his ass.

2011
02:27:39,310 --> 02:27:42,740
But I saw some shit this morning made me think twice.

2012
02:27:42,810 --> 02:27:45,750
See, now I'm thinkin' maybe it means...

2013
02:27:45,820 --> 02:27:50,680
you're the evil man, and I'm the righteous man,

2014
02:27:50,750 --> 02:27:53,690
and Mr. 9-millimeter here, he's the shepherd...

2015
02:27:53,760 --> 02:27:57,320
protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness.

2016
02:27:57,390 --> 02:27:59,330
Or it could mean...

2017
02:27:59,400 --> 02:28:02,830
you're the righteous man, and I'm the shepherd,

2018
02:28:02,900 --> 02:28:06,840
and it's the world that's evil and selfish.

2019
02:28:06,900 --> 02:28:09,170
Now, I'd like that.

2020
02:28:09,240 --> 02:28:12,140
But that shit ain't the truth.

2021
02:28:12,210 --> 02:28:14,070
The truth is,

2022
02:28:15,140 --> 02:28:17,080
you're the weak...

2023
02:28:18,480 --> 02:28:21,880
and I'm the tyranny of evil men.

2024
02:28:23,290 --> 02:28:25,220
But I'm tryin', Ringo.

2025
02:28:26,490 --> 02:28:29,420
I'm tryin' real hard...

2026
02:28:29,490 --> 02:28:31,760
to be the shepherd.

2027
02:28:47,080 --> 02:28:49,000
Go.

2028
02:29:06,690 --> 02:29:09,120
I think we should be leaving now.

2029
02:29:09,200 --> 02:29:12,120
- Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
