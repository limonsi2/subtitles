00:00:58,797 --> 00:00:59,624
Madeleine?

4
00:01:09,982 --> 00:01:11,332
Madeleine!

5
00:01:15,292 --> 00:01:16,641
Madeleine!

6
00:01:48,586 --> 00:01:50,284
Oh. No, no.

7
00:02:28,452 --> 00:02:32,500
Mama.
Mama. Mama. Mama!

8
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:36,504
Mama!

Mama!

-

15
00:03:34,953 --> 00:03:39,654
Is Mr. White home?
- No. He's gone.

16
00:03:39,697 --> 00:03:43,397
My name
is Lyutsifer Safin.

17
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,921
Your husband killed my family.

18
00:03:45,964 --> 00:03:48,445
I told you, he's gone.

19
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:51,970
I know.
This will hurt him more.

20
00:03:52,014 --> 00:03:53,407
-

21
00:04:11,163 --> 00:04:14,428

22
00:04:33,534 --> 00:04:35,449
-

23
00:07:13,781 --> 00:07:14,695
You okay?

24
00:07:17,132 --> 00:07:18,133
Yes.

25
00:07:20,222 --> 00:07:21,484
Let's go.

26
00:07:36,238 --> 00:07:37,239
How's the view?

27
00:07:39,154 --> 00:07:39,850
It's growing on me.

28
00:07:44,028 --> 00:07:44,681
Can you go faster?

29
00:07:46,422 --> 00:07:47,597
We don't need to go faster.

30
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,645
We have all the time
in the world.

31
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,547
-

32
00:08:31,815 --> 00:08:34,252
-

33
00:08:34,296 --> 00:08:36,777
You can't help
looking over your shoulder.

34
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,475
-What?
-No one is coming.

35
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,956
I wasn't looking
over my shoulder.

36
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:43,348
-Yes, you were.
-No.

37
00:08:43,392 --> 00:08:44,524
Are we gonna
have a row about this?

38
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,396
What are they burning?

39
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:50,747
Secrets. Wishes.
Letting go of the past.

40
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:53,228
Getting rid of old things,
in come the new.

41
00:09:27,088 --> 00:09:28,045
Where did you go to?

42
00:09:29,873 --> 00:09:32,093
Today, by the water. Hmm?

43
00:09:32,136 --> 00:09:33,573
Tell me.

44
00:09:36,445 --> 00:09:38,012
I'll tell you
if you tell me about Vesper.

45
00:09:41,363 --> 00:09:43,539
Is that why we're here?

46
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,062
She's buried at the acropolis.

47
00:09:45,106 --> 00:09:46,150
I know where she's buried.

48
00:09:48,326 --> 00:09:51,591
Can you forgive her? For us?

49
00:09:54,245 --> 00:09:55,943
I left her behind
a long time ago.

50
00:10:01,862 --> 00:10:04,386
As long as we're looking
over our shoulder,

51
00:10:04,429 --> 00:10:05,517
the past is not dead.

52
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:15,353
You have to let her go,
even if it's hard.

53
00:10:15,397 --> 00:10:18,269
You mean, um,
if we're to have a future?

54
00:10:18,313 --> 00:10:19,401
Mm-hmm.

55
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:23,840
So, I do this, and then...

56
00:10:23,884 --> 00:10:25,842
I'll tell you all my secrets.

57
00:10:28,976 --> 00:10:29,890
Okay.

58
00:11:29,776 --> 00:11:31,386
-

59
00:11:40,003 --> 00:11:42,963
I'm going to go
and do this,

60
00:11:43,006 --> 00:11:44,355
and then I'm going
to come back for breakfast.

61
00:11:47,097 --> 00:11:49,665
Thank you.

62
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,102
And then
you're going to tell me
where we're going next.

63
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:57,499
Home.

64
00:13:08,352 --> 00:13:10,006
I miss you.

65
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,458
What...

66
00:14:24,472 --> 00:14:24,994
Madeleine?

67
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:27,867
Madeleine?

68
00:15:00,421 --> 00:15:02,118
-

69
00:16:21,284 --> 00:16:22,416
Blofeld sends his regards.

70
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,289
You know...

71
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:29,162
Madeleine,
she is a daughter of Spectre.

72
00:16:30,337 --> 00:16:33,470
She's a daughter of Spectre.

73
00:17:18,254 --> 00:17:20,256
Your baggage
is already down, Mr. Bond.

74
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,866
As your wife requested.

75
00:17:28,743 --> 00:17:30,049
You were right.

76
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:35,097
Letting go is hard.

77
00:17:35,141 --> 00:17:36,533
James.

78
00:17:36,577 --> 00:17:38,100
What happened?

79
00:17:39,928 --> 00:17:42,800
-What happened?
-How did they know I was here?

80
00:17:42,844 --> 00:17:44,237
-What are you talking about?
-Madeleine,

81
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,717
how did they know I was here?

82
00:17:46,761 --> 00:17:48,893
-I have no idea what you're--
-Spectre. How did they know?

83
00:17:48,937 --> 00:17:50,504
What are you talking about?
James!

84
00:17:53,594 --> 00:17:54,334
I didn't do anything.

85
00:17:56,162 --> 00:17:57,859
-I didn't do anything.

86
00:18:03,778 --> 00:18:05,736
We're leaving.

87
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:21,796
There is something
I need to tell you.

88
00:18:22,405 --> 00:18:23,624
I bet there is.

89
00:18:28,933 --> 00:18:30,109
James!

90
00:18:44,427 --> 00:18:46,125
-

91
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,741
Pick it up. Pick it up!

92
00:19:06,884 --> 00:19:08,190
It's Blofeld, my love.

93
00:19:08,234 --> 00:19:09,974
Your father
would be so proud of you.

94
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,674
Your sacrifice
will be our glory.

95
00:19:13,717 --> 00:19:15,632
-I don't understand.
-Bravo.

96
00:19:15,676 --> 00:19:18,200
-

97
00:19:28,645 --> 00:19:32,693
James, why?
Why would I betray you?

98
00:19:32,736 --> 00:19:36,305
We all have our secrets,
we just didn't
get to yours yet.

99
00:19:38,438 --> 00:19:40,440
-

100
00:20:08,076 --> 00:20:10,426
James. James, listen to me.

101
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,906
I'd rather die
than you think I'm--

102
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:16,215
-

103
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,824
-

104
00:21:05,742 --> 00:21:08,049
-

105
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:13,446
James!

106
00:21:15,186 --> 00:21:16,492
James!

107
00:21:16,536 --> 00:21:17,493
Do something. James!

108
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,063
Say something, James!

109
00:21:23,673 --> 00:21:24,935
Please.

110
00:21:35,642 --> 00:21:36,556
Okay.

111
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:33,961
Come on.

112
00:22:48,976 --> 00:22:52,414
So, this is it?

113
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,417
This is it.

114
00:23:04,513 --> 00:23:05,949
How will I know
that you're okay?

115
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:08,517
You won't.

116
00:23:10,214 --> 00:23:11,346

-

152
00:27:54,934 --> 00:27:56,762
Please
remember to back up

153
00:27:56,805 --> 00:27:58,372
all data by 10:00 p.m.
this evening

154
00:27:58,415 --> 00:27:59,895
due to planned
server maintenance.

155
00:28:02,463 --> 00:28:04,378
You okay?

156
00:28:04,421 --> 00:28:06,032
You know the, uh, SL5,

157
00:28:06,075 --> 00:28:08,295
the weaponized smallpox
I was using this morning?

158
00:28:08,338 --> 00:28:12,212
Have you seen it?
I... I put it in the bloody...

159
00:28:12,255 --> 00:28:14,170
Valdo, you haven't seen a tub
of smallpox, have you?

160
00:28:16,651 --> 00:28:19,306
This was a good soup.

161
00:28:19,349 --> 00:28:22,788
Now it is waste,
even if it is joke.

162
00:28:22,831 --> 00:28:24,224
-

163
00:28:24,267 --> 00:28:26,661
There is more complexity
in my tomato soup

164
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:29,142
than in both
of your brains combined.

165
00:28:29,185 --> 00:28:31,971
Valdo, that is so unkind.
It's so...

166
00:28:32,014 --> 00:28:35,061
One day
I will put Ebola in your tea.

167
00:28:35,104 --> 00:28:38,412
And then I will watch
as your faces sweat blood...

168
00:28:38,455 --> 00:28:40,457
-...and I will be laughing.

169
00:28:40,501 --> 00:28:42,808
-Nice. Keep your hair on.
-Wow.

170
00:28:42,851 --> 00:28:45,158
He's got a terrifying
imagination, hasn't he?

171
00:28:45,201 --> 00:28:46,942
Dr. Obruchev.

172
00:28:46,986 --> 00:28:48,422
They are coming.

173
00:28:48,465 --> 00:28:49,989
-Who?
-Spectre.

174
00:28:55,603 --> 00:28:58,171
-Safin.
-Do not try to stop them.

175
00:28:58,214 --> 00:28:59,912
This is what
we've been waiting for.

176
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:06,483
They will ask you to enter
Bio Security Level Four fridge

177
00:29:06,527 --> 00:29:08,485
and remove the weapon.

178
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:11,924
No one must see
what you are doing.

179
00:29:11,967 --> 00:29:15,144
They will not kill you.
They think they need you.

180
00:29:15,188 --> 00:29:18,800
-They will not kill me?
-

181
00:29:18,844 --> 00:29:22,021
Transferring the files
as we speak.

182
00:29:22,064 --> 00:29:25,459
Now... Now it's done.
What do I do with it?

183
00:29:25,502 --> 00:29:27,026
Swallow it. Goodbye.

184
00:29:27,069 --> 00:29:28,549
-Swallow the...
-

185
00:29:28,592 --> 00:29:32,988
Yes, I like animals!

186
00:29:33,032 --> 00:29:33,989
Bye-bye.

187
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,048
Danger,
illegal access detected.

188
00:29:49,091 --> 00:29:51,485
Secure all biohazardous
materials immediately.

189
00:29:55,489 --> 00:29:57,447
Move! Follow!

190
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:02,191
No! No!
- Caution.

191
00:30:02,235 --> 00:30:04,715
Unauthorized personnel
located in this sector.

192
00:30:15,161 --> 00:30:17,032
Please,
we're scientists,
we're unarmed.

193
00:30:17,076 --> 00:30:18,207
We're unarmed.
What do you want?

194
00:30:21,036 --> 00:30:22,821
Valdo Obruchev.

195
00:30:22,864 --> 00:30:24,866
Hello.

196
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:27,042
Open the Bio Security
Level Four fridge.

197
00:30:28,783 --> 00:30:30,872
-And, uh...
-Give me the weapon.

198
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:34,484
The weap-- What weapon?
We have, uh...

199
00:30:35,224 --> 00:30:36,791
Heracles.

200
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,011
It requires
double authentication.

201
00:30:39,054 --> 00:30:40,012
Which one?

202
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:44,277
Him.

203
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,453
Hardy. Hardy! Don't let them.

204
00:30:46,496 --> 00:30:48,716
Don't let them.
Don't let them, please.

205
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:50,761
-

206
00:31:32,586 --> 00:31:35,067
-Oh.

207
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,851
Warning,

208
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,201
facility lockdown in progress.

209
00:31:39,245 --> 00:31:42,639
-All exits are now sealed.
-

210
00:31:42,683 --> 00:31:44,903
Warning,
facility lockdown in progress.

211
00:31:46,208 --> 00:31:47,818
All exits are now sealed.

212
00:31:50,169 --> 00:31:53,302
Oh, what is, uh...
It's a safety belt? This?

213
00:31:57,176 --> 00:31:58,133
Wow.

214
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:16,412
I... I cannot!

215
00:32:16,456 --> 00:32:18,327
There is no elevator!

216
00:32:28,598 --> 00:32:32,515
-

217
00:32:45,311 --> 00:32:47,182
Sir, I've just received
the most unusual--

218
00:32:47,226 --> 00:32:48,096
I've seen it.

219
00:32:55,016 --> 00:32:56,539
Oh, Jesus Christ.

220
00:33:00,848 --> 00:33:04,939
Sir, what's
the Heracles project?

221
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,463
-This lab isn't on the books.

222
00:33:07,507 --> 00:33:08,203
No, it's not.

223
00:33:11,467 --> 00:33:13,165
-There were casualties.
-It was a gas leak.

224
00:33:14,296 --> 00:33:15,732
Shall I alert the PM?

225
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,212
It was a gas leak.
I'll handle it.

226
00:33:17,256 --> 00:33:18,213
Moneypenny.

227
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:21,695
Where's 007?

228
00:35:41,313 --> 00:35:43,358
-

229
00:35:50,409 --> 00:35:51,888
Well,
isn't this a surprise, Felix?

230
00:35:51,932 --> 00:35:52,933
James.

231
00:35:54,413 --> 00:35:55,153
Who's the blond?

232
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:59,505
Logan Ash, State Department.
It's really nice to meet you.

233
00:35:59,548 --> 00:36:03,770
I've heard a lot about you.
I mean, I'm a huge fan.

234
00:36:03,813 --> 00:36:05,337
Babylon.
- Police boy.

235
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,425
I need a favor, brother.

236
00:36:06,468 --> 00:36:08,296
You didn't get the memo?
I'm retired.

237
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,602
I wouldn't ask
if you were still

238
00:36:09,645 --> 00:36:11,343
in Her Majesty's Service.

239
00:36:11,386 --> 00:36:12,605
And what does that mean?

240
00:36:14,476 --> 00:36:16,826
Our elected leaders aren't
playing nice in the sandbox.

241
00:36:18,611 --> 00:36:21,135
James.

242
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:24,399
Is there somewhere quiet
where we can talk in private?

243
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,882
Quiet? Yeah.

244
00:36:28,925 --> 00:36:31,537
-

245
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,234
I was hoping
you could pick up
a package.

246
00:36:33,278 --> 00:36:34,279
Five.
- Four.

247
00:36:36,672 --> 00:36:37,847
Where's the package?

248
00:36:37,891 --> 00:36:39,719
Short trip. Cuba.

249
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,244
Oh, I love it there?

250
00:36:43,288 --> 00:36:45,638
Hey. Valdo Obruchev.

251
00:36:45,681 --> 00:36:47,292
You're gonna say
you never heard of him.

252
00:36:47,335 --> 00:36:50,033
-Never heard of him. Two.
-Three.

253
00:36:50,077 --> 00:36:53,123
Ah... It's a good life.

254
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:55,474
You never heard of him?

255
00:36:55,517 --> 00:36:57,519
Didn't he defect
during your tenure at MI6?

256
00:36:57,563 --> 00:36:59,652
Obruchev was kidnapped
three days ago

257
00:36:59,695 --> 00:37:01,915
from a secret MI6 lab
in London.

258
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:04,657
Two days ago, his mug pinged
on a facial-recognition sweep

259
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,181
in Santiago de Cuba.

260
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,661
He's leaving out
the best part.

261
00:37:08,704 --> 00:37:10,489
Spectre.

262
00:37:10,532 --> 00:37:13,143
I have a contact there,
says they're gathering.

263
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:16,321
Coincidence?

264
00:37:17,974 --> 00:37:20,412
Come on.
It'll be like old times.

265
00:37:21,978 --> 00:37:22,675
-Three.
-Two.

266
00:37:27,157 --> 00:37:28,898
You're really
the only guy for the job.

267
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,902
-You're the guy.
-It's my round.

268
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,434
Hi.

269
00:37:46,916 --> 00:37:49,092
-Scotch.
-Yeah, man.

270
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,533
Where'd you find
the Book of Mormon?

271
00:37:54,576 --> 00:37:57,536
Political appointee.
Not my choice.

272
00:37:57,579 --> 00:37:59,668
Seems intelligence
isn't central anymore.

273
00:38:00,887 --> 00:38:02,323
He smiles too much.

274
00:38:02,367 --> 00:38:04,282
Help us get this
into the right hands.

275
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:05,718
Oh, what,
and you're the right hands?

276
00:38:05,761 --> 00:38:07,415
I'm not just a pretty face.

277
00:38:07,459 --> 00:38:10,026
I stopped trusting
pretty faces
a long time ago, Felix.

278
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:12,028
Yeah, I heard. Bad luck.

279
00:38:12,072 --> 00:38:14,596
-Bad judgment.
-Yeah.

280
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,250
Harder to tell
the good from bad,

281
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,773
villains from heroes
these days.

282
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,386
I need you, James.

283
00:38:21,429 --> 00:38:22,343
You're the only one
I trust with this.

284
00:38:22,387 --> 00:38:23,910
I'm not screwing around.

285
00:38:23,953 --> 00:38:25,303
I wanna get back to my family,

286
00:38:25,346 --> 00:38:27,087
tell them
I saved the world again.

287
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,741
Don't you?

288
00:38:32,353 --> 00:38:33,441
Nice to see you again, Felix.

289
00:38:35,661 --> 00:38:37,532
-At least take my number.
-I've got your number.

290
00:39:03,993 --> 00:39:05,560
In trouble?

291
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:09,521
Constantly.

292
00:39:09,564 --> 00:39:10,739
Need a ride?

293
00:39:12,567 --> 00:39:13,481
Sure. Why not?

294
00:39:17,746 --> 00:39:18,486
Hold on.

295
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:24,057
What's your name?
-Nomi.

296
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,581
-Yours?
-James. Call me James.

297
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:29,236
-What do you do, Nomi?
-I'm a diver.

298
00:39:29,279 --> 00:39:33,022
-What do you dive for?
-I have a thing for old wrecks.

299
00:39:33,066 --> 00:39:35,938
Well, then you've
come to the right place.
-

300
00:39:42,162 --> 00:39:43,555
After you.

301
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,612
Hmm...

302
00:39:57,656 --> 00:39:58,874
Nice house.

303
00:39:58,918 --> 00:40:01,094
Thank you.

304
00:40:01,137 --> 00:40:02,051
Is that the bedroom?

305
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:07,579
Yes, it is.

306
00:40:25,901 --> 00:40:27,425
Well,
that's not the first thing

307
00:40:27,468 --> 00:40:29,078
I thought you'd take off,
but, uh...

308
00:40:29,122 --> 00:40:30,950
Yeah.

309
00:40:30,993 --> 00:40:33,996
You seem like a man
who's gagging

310
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:38,131
-for some action, Mr. Bond.
-Shall we cut to the chase?

311
00:40:38,174 --> 00:40:40,133
I'm here
as a professional courtesy.

312
00:40:40,176 --> 00:40:41,221
Well, you're not very
courteous, are you?

313
00:40:41,264 --> 00:40:43,397
You've broken my car...

314
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,312
It's Commander Bond,
but you know that.

315
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:49,272
-Double-0?
-Two years.

316
00:40:49,316 --> 00:40:50,752
-Very young.
-High achiever.

317
00:40:50,796 --> 00:40:53,538
-Oh, Jesus Christ.
-The world's moved on

318
00:40:53,581 --> 00:40:55,714
since you retired,
Commander Bond.

319
00:40:55,757 --> 00:40:57,455
-Perhaps you didn't notice.
-No, can't say I had.

320
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:00,370
And in my humble opinion,

321
00:41:00,414 --> 00:41:01,894
the world
doesn't change very much.

322
00:41:01,937 --> 00:41:04,070
You would say that.

323
00:41:04,113 --> 00:41:05,767
Look,
this all seems like heaven,

324
00:41:05,811 --> 00:41:07,421
this little bubble,
or whatever.

325
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,988
-But it's so obvious

326
00:41:09,031 --> 00:41:11,251
you're a man
who only has time to kill,

327
00:41:11,294 --> 00:41:13,166
nothing to live for.

328
00:41:13,209 --> 00:41:16,822
So Valdo Obruchev
is off-limits.

329
00:41:16,865 --> 00:41:19,085
You get in my way, I will put
a bullet in your knee.

330
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:22,044
The one that works.

331
00:41:24,743 --> 00:41:26,614
You need to ask yourself
a few more questions.

332
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:32,011
MI6, CIA
chasing after the same man,

333
00:41:32,054 --> 00:41:34,796
not communicating
with each other, that...

334
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,625
-That's not good.
-Hmm.

335
00:41:37,669 --> 00:41:40,976
You know what?
Tell M hello, but...

336
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:41,847
I don't work for him anymore.

337
00:41:43,849 --> 00:41:45,328
Tell him yourself.

338
00:41:47,809 --> 00:41:49,768
By the way,

339
00:41:49,811 --> 00:41:51,726
I'm not just any old double-0.

340
00:41:52,814 --> 00:41:54,337
I'm 007.

341
00:41:57,036 --> 00:41:58,603
You probably
thought they'd retire it.

342
00:42:01,301 --> 00:42:04,043
-It's just a number.
-

343
00:42:04,086 --> 00:42:05,174
Yeah.

344
00:42:07,002 --> 00:42:07,655
See you in Cuba?

345
00:42:10,615 --> 00:42:12,355
How's it going, Q?

346
00:42:12,399 --> 00:42:14,444
Several large files seem
to have been wiped

347
00:42:14,488 --> 00:42:16,011
from Obruchev's hard drive.

348
00:42:16,055 --> 00:42:18,623
He was working on some
pretty advanced algorithm...

349
00:42:18,666 --> 00:42:21,408
-Can you retrieve the files?
-Trying.

350
00:42:21,451 --> 00:42:23,758
Get me everything you can
and then destroy the drive.

351
00:42:23,802 --> 00:42:25,499
If I knew more about
what this was, I could...

352
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,154
-Thank you, Q. That's all.
-

353
00:42:28,197 --> 00:42:29,851
Yes. One minute.
The PM is calling again.

354
00:42:29,895 --> 00:42:31,723
007.
Tell them something. Anything.

355
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:36,771
-007.
- M, darling.

356
00:42:36,815 --> 00:42:37,685
Couple of things.

357
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,603
-Bond.
-I met your new 007.

358
00:42:42,647 --> 00:42:44,170
She's a disarming young woman.

359
00:42:45,084 --> 00:42:47,608
So, Obruchev.

360
00:42:47,652 --> 00:42:49,523
You kept him
on the payroll, didn't you?

361
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:52,091
Stay out of it.
This has nothing
to do with you.

362
00:42:52,134 --> 00:42:54,397
It does. It's Spectre.

363
00:42:54,441 --> 00:42:58,053
Mallory, what have you done?

364
00:43:08,107 --> 00:43:09,804
-Double-0 trouble?
-The CIA have the advantage.

365
00:43:10,892 --> 00:43:12,415
Get me Blofeld.

366
00:43:12,459 --> 00:43:14,113
Sir, he only speaks
to his psychiatrist.

367
00:43:14,156 --> 00:43:15,810
I know.
The live feed's what I want.

368
00:43:22,121 --> 00:43:24,427
They stay
straight in the middle.

369
00:43:24,471 --> 00:43:26,429
And then they bring him up.

370
00:43:26,473 --> 00:43:29,041
He's like this every day,
mad as a bag of bees.

371
00:43:29,084 --> 00:43:31,521
It's crowning day.
-Good.

372
00:43:31,565 --> 00:43:35,264
-What is it?
-It's nothing.

373
00:43:35,308 --> 00:43:38,833
It's clean as can be.
Everyone just wants a party.

374
00:43:38,877 --> 00:43:40,095
Yeah, I want them both
to hear me.

375
00:43:41,662 --> 00:43:42,707
Be a surprise.

376
00:44:08,733 --> 00:44:11,126
Felix, I'm in.

377
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:13,172
He's in.

378
00:44:13,215 --> 00:44:15,261
There's a young lady
in Santiago I want you to meet.

379
00:44:49,425 --> 00:44:54,169
-

380
00:45:04,789 --> 00:45:05,615
Paloma?

381
00:45:08,618 --> 00:45:11,926
-You're late. Vamos.
-I...

382
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:14,450
Uh, something about a hat?
Paris, uh...

383
00:45:14,494 --> 00:45:15,887
Huh? What hat?

384
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:21,849
I forget things
when I get nervous.

385
00:45:21,893 --> 00:45:23,155
This is the biggest job
I've ever had.

386
00:45:37,256 --> 00:45:37,865
This your room?

387
00:45:39,301 --> 00:45:40,128
It's a wine cellar.

388
00:45:42,522 --> 00:45:43,958
Okay, come here.

389
00:45:47,962 --> 00:45:49,703
Don't you think we ought
to get to know each other

390
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,749
just a little bit
before we, um...

391
00:45:51,792 --> 00:45:54,273
No, no, no, no.

392
00:45:54,316 --> 00:45:58,059
Um, no, I'm sorry.
Um...

393
00:45:58,103 --> 00:45:59,800
-All right.
-You do it.

394
00:45:59,844 --> 00:46:01,236
Thank you.

395
00:46:04,979 --> 00:46:05,980
Do you mind, uh...

396
00:46:11,507 --> 00:46:14,815
-This is gonna go brilliantly.
-I know.

397
00:46:14,859 --> 00:46:15,773
I've done
three weeks' training.

398
00:46:39,144 --> 00:46:40,362
-Let's get a drink.

399
00:46:41,581 --> 00:46:43,235
Good idea.

400
00:46:47,935 --> 00:46:50,459
Two vodka martinis,
shaken, not stirred.

401
00:46:50,503 --> 00:46:51,243
Si, senor.

402
00:47:03,255 --> 00:47:04,822
-So I can hear you.

403
00:47:11,741 --> 00:47:12,742
What shall we drink to?

404
00:47:14,527 --> 00:47:16,007
-Felix?
-To Felix.

405
00:47:18,618 --> 00:47:19,837
Remind me to get him a cigar.

406
00:47:30,325 --> 00:47:31,544
Vamos?

407
00:47:31,587 --> 00:47:32,675
-Sure.
-Okay.

408
00:47:34,764 --> 00:47:40,031
-

409
00:47:41,597 --> 00:47:43,643
Will this sample
be enough for you?

410
00:47:43,686 --> 00:47:46,298
If he has used it, yes.

411
00:47:46,341 --> 00:47:47,473
It is now progressing.

412
00:47:54,697 --> 00:47:56,351
Oops. Sorry.

413
00:47:58,005 --> 00:48:01,052
Terrible, terrible gloves.
So slippery.

414
00:48:02,227 --> 00:48:03,097
Forgive me.

415
00:48:03,793 --> 00:48:04,882
How much longer?

416
00:48:09,669 --> 00:48:11,105
A-ha.

417
00:48:13,238 --> 00:48:15,109
To happy new future
for Spectre.

418
00:48:18,243 --> 00:48:19,070
Now, it is ready.

419
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:49,143
-

420
00:48:50,188 --> 00:48:51,580
You go that way.

421
00:48:51,624 --> 00:48:53,017
I'll go this way.

422
00:49:00,763 --> 00:49:03,114
What is this?
Spectre bunga-bunga?

423
00:49:05,246 --> 00:49:07,466
You ever been
to a party like this?

424
00:49:07,509 --> 00:49:08,989
How do you think
I got this job?

425
00:49:09,033 --> 00:49:11,035
Don't get distracted, now.

426
00:49:11,078 --> 00:49:13,211
Remember, we're looking
for our Russian scientist.

427
00:49:13,254 --> 00:49:14,734
I'm seeing
a lot of Spectre agents.

428
00:49:14,777 --> 00:49:16,954
Yes.

429
00:49:16,997 --> 00:49:17,955
And it looks like all of them.

430
00:49:22,655 --> 00:49:23,743
Wow.

431
00:49:34,884 --> 00:49:36,234
Friend of yours?

432
00:49:36,277 --> 00:49:39,498
Cyclops. We ran
into each other in Italy.

433
00:49:39,541 --> 00:49:42,718
That was
an eye-opening experience.

434
00:49:44,894 --> 00:49:46,592
They're wearing earpieces.

435
00:49:46,635 --> 00:49:48,289
Scanning.

436
00:49:56,689 --> 00:49:59,605
It'll be clean.
It's good.
It's as good as can be.

437
00:49:59,648 --> 00:50:01,433
It's my party.
-Ah. Found it.

438
00:50:01,476 --> 00:50:03,435
Celebrate me,
my birthday,

439
00:50:03,478 --> 00:50:04,653
my crowning day.

440
00:50:07,047 --> 00:50:08,440
Who's the birthday boy?

441
00:50:08,483 --> 00:50:10,224
Um...

442
00:50:10,268 --> 00:50:13,575
-Ernst Stavro Blofeld.
-Is he here?

443
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:14,881
No, he's...

444
00:50:14,924 --> 00:50:16,535
Make your way.
Follow the music.

445
00:50:16,578 --> 00:50:18,493
He's in London in prison.

446
00:50:18,537 --> 00:50:20,756
How do you know for sure?

447
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,976
Because I put him there.

448
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,065
...feel my warm embrace.

449
00:50:25,109 --> 00:50:28,025
Experience
a delicious surprise.

450
00:50:29,765 --> 00:50:31,898
Let us shepherd humanity

451
00:50:31,941 --> 00:50:33,247
with our new power.

452
00:50:33,291 --> 00:50:34,553
I've spotted him,

453
00:50:34,596 --> 00:50:37,295
our little Russian scientist.

454
00:50:37,338 --> 00:50:38,774
Have you got him?
- I'm here.

455
00:50:38,818 --> 00:50:41,299
-I got him.
- Stay with him.

456
00:50:41,342 --> 00:50:44,215
But I see you
from my little eye,

457
00:50:44,258 --> 00:50:46,695
and my little eye says hi.

458
00:50:46,739 --> 00:50:50,438
Now, see, now,

459
00:50:50,482 --> 00:50:53,528
we emerge from the shadows
as gods on Mount Olympus.

460
00:50:55,356 --> 00:50:58,272
Here's to the end
of our pariah.

461
00:50:58,316 --> 00:51:01,232
Oh, my burden, my brother...

462
00:51:03,408 --> 00:51:04,539
James Bond.

463
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:07,890
Goodbye, James.

464
00:51:07,934 --> 00:51:10,806
-

465
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:13,070
You're popular tonight.

466
00:51:14,419 --> 00:51:16,116
You can't run.

467
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,075
-It's too late.
-

468
00:51:21,295 --> 00:51:25,125
It's already crawling
under your skin.

469
00:51:25,169 --> 00:51:27,606
Don't be alarmed,
it's harmless to us.

470
00:51:27,649 --> 00:51:30,783
-Just to him. So delicious.
-

471
00:51:38,312 --> 00:51:39,357
Sir!

472
00:51:42,795 --> 00:51:44,318
It is working.

473
00:51:44,362 --> 00:51:46,103
It is working.
Only Spectre are dying.

474
00:51:58,202 --> 00:51:59,899
Hello.

475
00:51:59,942 --> 00:52:02,989
Are you for my, uh, esco...

476
00:52:03,032 --> 00:52:05,600
Hmm?
-No? Oh.

477
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:13,304
Go!

478
00:52:24,924 --> 00:52:26,882
-Thank you. I'll take this.
- No!

479
00:52:26,926 --> 00:52:27,666
-What was that?
- Get him!

480
00:52:37,415 --> 00:52:38,372
Time to go. Let's go!

481
00:52:50,776 --> 00:52:52,604
It's clear.

482
00:52:56,869 --> 00:52:58,349
May I cut in?

483
00:53:02,396 --> 00:53:04,659
Go get him.
I'll hold them off.

484
00:53:04,703 --> 00:53:06,618
Cover the exits!

485
00:53:06,661 --> 00:53:07,358
Paloma.

486
00:53:11,405 --> 00:53:12,363
Don't let them
get away!

487
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:19,718
Have you got them?

488
00:53:19,761 --> 00:53:21,415
Nearly.

489
00:53:21,459 --> 00:53:22,460
No!

490
00:53:39,651 --> 00:53:40,695
Down!

491
00:53:44,133 --> 00:53:45,657
Get them!
Don't let them get away!

492
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:47,311
Paloma,
I know you're busy,

493
00:53:47,354 --> 00:53:49,487
but the curtain's about
to come down on this one.

494
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:50,966
I can get a car.
Where do you need it?

495
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:52,794
I'll be right there.

496
00:53:58,931 --> 00:54:00,019
Stay down!

497
00:54:03,152 --> 00:54:04,241
Move!

498
00:54:33,357 --> 00:54:34,271
Huh?

499
00:54:44,019 --> 00:54:44,542
Come on!

500
00:54:52,941 --> 00:54:54,508
Three weeks' training,
really?

501
00:54:54,552 --> 00:54:55,596
More or less.

502
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:56,989
We're still gonna
need that car.

503
00:54:57,032 --> 00:54:58,469
-Salud!
-Salud!

504
00:55:23,624 --> 00:55:25,583
Where are you taking me?

505
00:55:25,626 --> 00:55:26,801
I'm taking you back
to Mother, darling.

506
00:55:26,845 --> 00:55:28,325
Mother? Oh, no, no, no.

507
00:55:33,112 --> 00:55:34,026
Huh. There you are.

508
00:55:39,553 --> 00:55:41,512
-

509
00:55:42,643 --> 00:55:43,514
No!

510
00:55:50,651 --> 00:55:52,131
-Stay there!

511
00:55:52,174 --> 00:55:54,176
-You okay?
-I'm great.

512
00:56:02,271 --> 00:56:04,622
I'm gonna borrow
your plane. Sorry.

513
00:56:26,426 --> 00:56:27,209
It's a shortcut.

514
00:56:41,659 --> 00:56:43,617
This is my stop. Goodbye.

515
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:48,405
-You were excellent.
-You too.

516
00:56:48,448 --> 00:56:51,364
-Next time, stay longer.
-I will.

517
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:53,192
-Hey, a cigar for Felix.
-Thank you. Come on.

518
00:56:53,235 --> 00:56:54,454
-Ciao.
-Ciao.

519
00:57:02,288 --> 00:57:03,942
Come on, let's go.

520
00:57:03,985 --> 00:57:06,901
No, no, no, sir,
I am not getting on that.

521
00:57:06,945 --> 00:57:10,165
Well, that's a shame
because we don't have a choice.

522
00:57:10,209 --> 00:57:11,950
Let's go. Come on.

523
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:16,911
Okay, okay,
what have we got here?

524
00:57:32,144 --> 00:57:36,322
Sir, I just saved
your life, okay?
Please remember that.

525
00:57:36,365 --> 00:57:39,891
So, could you please tell me
what the hell is going on?

526
00:57:39,934 --> 00:57:40,935
Where are you taking me?

527
00:57:42,502 --> 00:57:43,677
Somewhere safe.

528
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:12,314
At least make it look hard.

529
00:58:12,358 --> 00:58:13,707
Thanks, Felix,
you walked me into a trap.
Get in.

530
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:19,147
-What trap?
- Spectre's dead. Sit.

531
00:58:19,191 --> 00:58:20,540
Who's dead?
-All of them.

532
00:58:20,584 --> 00:58:21,541
Good.

533
00:58:24,065 --> 00:58:27,112
What is this?
Explain it to me.

534
00:58:27,155 --> 00:58:29,767
I don't have the words
to describe
to someone like you.

535
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:30,681
Try one.

536
00:58:32,204 --> 00:58:34,989
It's perfect.

537
00:58:35,033 --> 00:58:36,295
A perfect what?

538
00:58:36,338 --> 00:58:37,992
What? Assassin.

539
00:58:38,036 --> 00:58:39,951
Thank you, Bond,
your mission's done.

540
00:58:39,994 --> 00:58:41,343
Why didn't it kill me?
-You don't have to answer

541
00:58:41,387 --> 00:58:43,389
-those questions. Bond!
-Why Spectre?

542
00:58:43,432 --> 00:58:44,956
-Bond, please stop
asking these questions.
-Quiet!

543
00:58:44,999 --> 00:58:46,827
Speak up.

544
00:58:46,871 --> 00:58:50,265
Because you were never
the intended target.

545
00:58:50,309 --> 00:58:52,267
He was a target? Why?

546
00:58:52,311 --> 00:58:54,531
I changed the DNA
like we decided.

547
00:58:54,574 --> 00:58:56,228
Now the plan is complete

548
00:58:56,271 --> 00:58:57,751
-and I'm confused.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

549
00:58:57,795 --> 00:58:59,753
Who is "we"?
Did M make you build this?

550
00:58:59,797 --> 00:59:01,233
He is out of line here, Felix.

551
00:59:01,276 --> 00:59:03,148
Did M order you
to kill Spectre?

552
00:59:03,191 --> 00:59:04,758
-Don't answer that!
-Is M behind this?

553
00:59:04,802 --> 00:59:06,238
-He is out of line!
-Felix!

554
00:59:06,281 --> 00:59:07,979
Ash, shut your mouth!

555
00:59:08,022 --> 00:59:10,024
M.
M helped me build it.

556
00:59:10,068 --> 00:59:12,070
But please,
he does not have the vision

557
00:59:12,113 --> 00:59:14,594
-for how to use it.
-Well, who does? Who does?

558
00:59:14,638 --> 00:59:17,728
Blofeld? How did he know
I was going to be there?

559
00:59:25,605 --> 00:59:27,041
Oh!

560
01:00:15,394 --> 01:00:16,700
I'm with Safin.
You understand?

561
01:00:16,743 --> 01:00:19,137
Yes. I am Dr. Obruchev.

562
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:20,834
I know who you are.

563
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:26,361
I don't know about you,

564
01:00:26,405 --> 01:00:28,625
but I got a feeling in my gut
Ash might not be on our side.

565
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:32,106
We need to have a conversation

566
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:33,499
about the company you keep.

567
01:00:33,542 --> 01:00:34,805
I'm with you.

568
01:00:37,982 --> 01:00:38,678
That's a lot of blood.

569
01:00:42,856 --> 01:00:45,119
So,
where are we going?

570
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:48,079
Get in the plane, Doctor.

571
01:00:48,122 --> 01:00:50,124
This might be my last mission.

572
01:00:50,168 --> 01:00:51,865
-What do you think?
-I think you're just looking

573
01:00:51,909 --> 01:00:53,432
for an excuse
not to help me.

574
01:00:53,475 --> 01:00:55,521
-There you go.

575
01:00:55,564 --> 01:00:57,436
Paloma, she gave me a cigar
for you to smoke,

576
01:00:57,479 --> 01:00:59,177
and you are gonna smoke it.

577
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:01,919
Nice, but maybe you should
hold on to that for now.

578
01:01:01,962 --> 01:01:04,530
You just stay put.
Keep the pressure on that.

579
01:01:04,573 --> 01:01:05,879
I'm gonna find us a way out.

580
01:01:07,925 --> 01:01:10,014
I'll be over here.

581
01:01:10,057 --> 01:01:11,189
You know, Felix, we really
need to stop meeting--

582
01:01:17,804 --> 01:01:20,677
Ooh.
-Okay.

583
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,679
I was such
a big fan of his.

584
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:30,687
Felix!

585
01:01:43,743 --> 01:01:44,831
This doesn't look good.

586
01:01:46,485 --> 01:01:51,142
Come on, Felix,
we've been in worse
than this. Let's go.

587
01:01:51,185 --> 01:01:54,188
It's like back when I was
a kid on that shrimp boat.

588
01:01:54,232 --> 01:01:56,190
You're from Milwaukee.

589
01:01:56,234 --> 01:01:57,931
Am I?
I thought I made that up.

590
01:02:04,546 --> 01:02:07,027
-He got me.
-

591
01:02:07,071 --> 01:02:09,334
Just let me go.
Let me go.

592
01:02:16,558 --> 01:02:17,734
You got this?

593
01:02:20,824 --> 01:02:21,955
Yeah. Yeah.

594
01:02:24,436 --> 01:02:25,742
Make it worth it.

595
01:02:28,527 --> 01:02:30,572
James,

596
01:02:30,616 --> 01:02:32,879
it's a good life, isn't it?

597
01:02:35,229 --> 01:02:36,753
The best.

598
01:02:41,192 --> 01:02:42,193
Felix.

599
01:02:45,326 --> 01:02:46,980
Felix. Felix.

600
01:05:16,347 --> 01:05:17,522
-Name?
-Bond.

601
01:05:21,178 --> 01:05:22,831
James Bond.

602
01:05:27,575 --> 01:05:28,881
How's retirement?

603
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:29,969
Quiet.

604
01:05:32,624 --> 01:05:35,932
Hi. Where's Obruchev?

605
01:05:35,975 --> 01:05:37,846
I thought you two
would get along.

606
01:05:37,890 --> 01:05:40,110
-Report, 007.
-Thank you.

607
01:05:41,502 --> 01:05:42,721
00... 7.

608
01:05:44,636 --> 01:05:45,942
That must bother you.

609
01:05:49,554 --> 01:05:50,772
Where is he?

610
01:05:50,816 --> 01:05:52,470
He left me for somebody else.

611
01:05:52,513 --> 01:05:53,950
It's, uh...

612
01:05:53,993 --> 01:05:55,864
-So, you lost him?
-You can go in.

613
01:05:55,908 --> 01:05:58,128
-Thank you.
-Thank y...

614
01:05:58,171 --> 01:05:59,216
Alone, I'm afraid.

615
01:06:01,174 --> 01:06:02,132
Oh, does that bother you?

616
01:06:09,617 --> 01:06:10,792
I get why you shot him.

617
01:06:10,836 --> 01:06:11,750
Yeah, well,

618
01:06:11,793 --> 01:06:14,057
everyone tries at least once.

619
01:06:18,626 --> 01:06:21,064
Has this desk got bigger?

620
01:06:23,631 --> 01:06:24,632
Or have you got smaller?

621
01:06:27,548 --> 01:06:29,768
I can't pretend there
weren't some sorry faces

622
01:06:29,811 --> 01:06:31,030
when you left us, Bond,

623
01:06:31,074 --> 01:06:33,990
but you fell
so far off the grid

624
01:06:34,033 --> 01:06:34,991
that we thought
you must be dead.

625
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:38,211
Now, learning that you

626
01:06:39,865 --> 01:06:41,998
were, in fact,
alive and well, and...

627
01:06:43,912 --> 01:06:46,176
working for the CIA, well...

628
01:06:50,049 --> 01:06:51,268
Well, that really was a blow.

629
01:06:51,311 --> 01:06:54,227
Well,
they just asked so nicely.

630
01:06:56,273 --> 01:06:58,449
It's a shame that you
haven't lost your touch.

631
01:07:00,146 --> 01:07:01,408
We wouldn't be in this mess.

632
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:04,194
This is your mess.

633
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:08,067
Blofeld tried to kill me
in Cuba,

634
01:07:08,111 --> 01:07:09,938
but someone hijacked his plan.

635
01:07:11,114 --> 01:07:13,029
And whoever stole your weapon

636
01:07:13,072 --> 01:07:15,901
used it
to wipe out Spectre instead.

637
01:07:15,944 --> 01:07:18,991
Now your weapon is on the run

638
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:21,776
and nobody seems
to know who has it.

639
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:23,648
So you can imagine
why I've come back to play.

640
01:07:23,691 --> 01:07:25,345
We're looking into it.

641
01:07:25,389 --> 01:07:27,478
I can identify
the man that took Obruchev.

642
01:07:27,521 --> 01:07:28,827
And what do you want
in return, Bond?

643
01:07:30,263 --> 01:07:31,351
Blofeld.

644
01:07:31,395 --> 01:07:33,788
Impossible. He's in Belmarsh.

645
01:07:33,832 --> 01:07:36,269
Yes. He ran a Spectre meeting

646
01:07:36,313 --> 01:07:38,489
in Cuba from Belmarsh.

647
01:07:38,532 --> 01:07:40,143
-How?
-No.

648
01:07:40,186 --> 01:07:42,971
How?
No one has access. No one.

649
01:07:43,015 --> 01:07:46,758
Why didn't you shut it down?

650
01:07:46,801 --> 01:07:48,542
Why didn't you
shut Heracles down?

651
01:07:48,586 --> 01:07:51,763
I answer to the interests
of my country, not you.

652
01:07:51,806 --> 01:07:55,027
-And to Felix Leiter?
-I certainly don't answer
to Felix Leiter.

653
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:56,942
Perhaps because he's dead.

654
01:08:03,775 --> 01:08:05,081
I'm sorry.

655
01:08:07,257 --> 01:08:08,562
I had a lot of respect
for Leiter.

656
01:08:14,786 --> 01:08:17,571
Look, if you have information,
I'd be happy to receive it.

657
01:08:17,615 --> 01:08:19,617
-Get me into Belmarsh.
-No.

658
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:22,185
Blofeld's the only member
of Spectre still breathing,

659
01:08:22,228 --> 01:08:23,621
-I can't risk that.
-Oh, but you will

660
01:08:23,664 --> 01:08:26,145
risk developing
a DNA-targeting weapon

661
01:08:26,189 --> 01:08:29,148
with a corrupt scientist
for ten years?

662
01:08:29,192 --> 01:08:31,324
There was nothing
to suggest that Obruchev

663
01:08:31,368 --> 01:08:33,326
was working for anyone else.
I had him--

664
01:08:33,370 --> 01:08:35,285
My God,
you're thirsty at the moment.

665
01:08:37,243 --> 01:08:40,159
You have no right
to speak to me that way.

666
01:08:40,203 --> 01:08:43,815
You have no right to make
insinuations about my judgment.

667
01:08:43,858 --> 01:08:48,167
If you've nothing left
to give, you are irrelevant.

668
01:08:48,211 --> 01:08:49,647
You've done your bit
and we thank you
for your service,

669
01:08:49,690 --> 01:08:52,128
again. Goodbye.

670
01:08:54,173 --> 01:08:56,610
-Moneypenny, send in 007.

671
01:08:56,654 --> 01:08:57,481
You can go, Bond.

672
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:06,533
It's definitely the same desk.

673
01:09:11,495 --> 01:09:12,539
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

674
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:19,372
-Go to Belmarsh.

675
01:09:19,416 --> 01:09:21,983
I want everything
that Blofeld listens to,

676
01:09:22,027 --> 01:09:24,160
looks at and touches scanned.

677
01:09:24,203 --> 01:09:25,813
Scan every corner
of that cell.

678
01:09:25,857 --> 01:09:27,902
Scan the whole prison.

679
01:09:27,946 --> 01:09:30,688
In fact,
scan the whole damn man.

680
01:09:30,731 --> 01:09:33,169
Sir. I'll bring my gloves.

681
01:09:37,216 --> 01:09:39,175
James...
Uh...

682
01:09:41,699 --> 01:09:43,004
What are you doing for dinner?

683
01:10:05,026 --> 01:10:06,419
-

684
01:10:13,121 --> 01:10:14,993
-So, you're not dead?
-Hello, Q. I've missed you.

685
01:10:16,516 --> 01:10:18,518
Mm!
That smells great.

686
01:10:18,562 --> 01:10:20,259
-Were you expecting somebody?
-

687
01:10:20,303 --> 01:10:22,783
Um... No. What...
Excuse me.

688
01:10:24,045 --> 01:10:26,091
Oh.

689
01:10:26,134 --> 01:10:29,747
This is the first time I've...
He'll be here in 20 minutes,

690
01:10:29,790 --> 01:10:31,270
I can't take my focus off...

691
01:10:31,314 --> 01:10:33,011
I need you to tell me
what's on that.

692
01:10:33,054 --> 01:10:34,665
No, I need to lay the table.

693
01:10:38,799 --> 01:10:41,367
You know,
they come with fur these days.

694
01:10:41,411 --> 01:10:44,762
I want to be very clear
that I am not authorized
to help you.

695
01:10:44,805 --> 01:10:46,677
-And I have sworn...
-It's to do with Heracles.

696
01:10:49,897 --> 01:10:51,986
I presume M doesn't know
that this is happening.

697
01:10:52,030 --> 01:10:54,685
No, but there's something
going on, Q.

698
01:10:54,728 --> 01:10:55,642
We need to find out
what it is.

699
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:03,302
Well, it's never
9:00 to 5:00, is it?

700
01:11:04,825 --> 01:11:06,436
Thank you.

701
01:11:11,745 --> 01:11:13,791
-Um, Bond?
- Yes?

702
01:11:13,834 --> 01:11:15,053
Do you know
where this has been?

703
01:11:15,096 --> 01:11:16,489
Everywhere, I should imagine.

704
01:11:18,099 --> 01:11:18,926
Into the sandbox.

705
01:11:23,931 --> 01:11:25,106
Oh. Thank you.

706
01:11:27,544 --> 01:11:29,589
- Um, it's a database.

707
01:11:29,633 --> 01:11:32,113
Don't touch that, please.

708
01:11:32,157 --> 01:11:33,506
What's the data?

709
01:11:33,550 --> 01:11:35,726
It's DNA.
Multiple individuals.

710
01:11:35,769 --> 01:11:37,510
What was M working on?

711
01:11:37,554 --> 01:11:39,251
Something he should have
shut down years ago.

712
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:41,209
Oh, hello.
- What?

713
01:11:41,253 --> 01:11:43,386
There's more.
Hidden files.

714
01:11:43,429 --> 01:11:46,606
I was asked to recover
what I could

715
01:11:46,650 --> 01:11:49,261
from Obruchev's hard drive
just after the explosion,

716
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:51,002
and I have
a pretty good feeling that...

717
01:11:51,045 --> 01:11:54,875
this is what was missing.
Yeah. A complete disk.

718
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:02,405
So, Obruchev is working
for someone

719
01:12:02,448 --> 01:12:03,928
who managed
to kill all of Spectre?

720
01:12:03,971 --> 01:12:05,321
Not all of them.

721
01:12:07,061 --> 01:12:08,193
Blofeld.

722
01:12:08,236 --> 01:12:09,934
Can you show me
the other files?

723
01:12:09,977 --> 01:12:11,239
Mm-hmm.

724
01:12:16,810 --> 01:12:19,030
Wait,
this can't just be Spectre.

725
01:12:20,423 --> 01:12:23,991
Oh, my God.
There are thousands.

726
01:12:25,819 --> 01:12:26,559
Who are they?

727
01:12:28,039 --> 01:12:29,606
They're in categories.

728
01:12:29,649 --> 01:12:31,651
I'm gonna need
more time to organize...

729
01:12:31,695 --> 01:12:33,697
There have been, uh, breaches

730
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:36,134
round the world of databases
holding DNA information.

731
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,659
-We've been tracking them.
-Ours?

732
01:12:39,703 --> 01:12:41,008
I can't imagine
they're leaving us out,

733
01:12:41,052 --> 01:12:43,054
whoever they are.

734
01:12:43,097 --> 01:12:45,317
Well, Blofeld
will know who they are.

735
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:46,405
Q, you need to get me
into Belmarsh.

736
01:12:49,234 --> 01:12:52,106
Well, there's only one person
he'll speak to.

737
01:12:52,150 --> 01:12:54,935
Who? M says no one has access.

738
01:12:54,979 --> 01:12:56,807
-Really?
-Did he?

739
01:12:56,850 --> 01:12:58,548
What's that?

740
01:13:00,463 --> 01:13:02,203
Can I just have
one nice evening, please,

741
01:13:02,247 --> 01:13:03,335
before the world explodes?

742
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:05,555
Who has access? Who?

743
01:13:12,866 --> 01:13:14,520
Morning.
- Morning.

744
01:13:14,564 --> 01:13:17,349
New patient.
He's weird.

745
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:18,959
You can't say that.

746
01:13:25,052 --> 01:13:26,010
I'm sorry I'm late.

747
01:13:28,882 --> 01:13:30,406
I wasn't expecting
a new patient.

748
01:13:35,498 --> 01:13:38,065
Sorry if I surprised you.

749
01:13:38,979 --> 01:13:40,851
No. I like surprises.

750
01:13:44,942 --> 01:13:47,901
You're very attractive
for a psychotherapist.

751
01:13:47,945 --> 01:13:49,816
Must be dangerous
for your clients.

752
01:13:54,734 --> 01:13:56,432
They are usually more
of a danger to themselves.

753
01:14:01,262 --> 01:14:02,438
Foxgloves.

754
01:14:03,090 --> 01:14:04,222
Beautiful.

755
01:14:05,789 --> 01:14:07,399
-Did you choose them?
-Yes.

756
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:09,096
I found them friendly.

757
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:10,968
You know if you eat them

758
01:14:11,011 --> 01:14:13,057
they can cause your heart
to just...

759
01:14:16,103 --> 01:14:17,061
stop.

760
01:14:18,366 --> 01:14:20,151
Then I'll make sure not to.

761
01:14:28,202 --> 01:14:29,247
Do you know a lot
about flowers?

762
01:14:29,290 --> 01:14:32,119
My father had a garden.

763
01:14:32,163 --> 01:14:33,512
He taught me.

764
01:14:33,556 --> 01:14:38,648
He died when I was young,
but my interest remained.

765
01:14:39,779 --> 01:14:41,041
It's difficult
to lose a parent.

766
01:14:43,566 --> 01:14:44,610
Especially at a young age.

767
01:14:45,742 --> 01:14:47,439
Yes,

768
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:50,877
death has
a particular effect
on children,

769
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:53,271
doesn't it?

770
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:57,928
What effect
did it have on you?

771
01:14:58,798 --> 01:15:00,191
Profound.

772
01:15:00,234 --> 01:15:02,715
But I saved a life once.

773
01:15:04,587 --> 01:15:06,066
I think that had
more of an effect.

774
01:15:07,981 --> 01:15:09,200
Why is that?

775
01:15:09,243 --> 01:15:11,985
Saving someone's life

776
01:15:12,029 --> 01:15:15,772
connects you
to them forever,
the same as taking it.

777
01:15:17,861 --> 01:15:18,905
They belong to you.

778
01:15:24,041 --> 01:15:26,347
I'm not very good
at talking about myself,

779
01:15:26,391 --> 01:15:28,524
so I brought a memory box.

780
01:15:32,005 --> 01:15:34,704
I thought
it might interest you.

781
01:15:34,747 --> 01:15:37,750
Sometimes objects
can be more evocative
than memories.

782
01:15:49,762 --> 01:15:52,548
I never forgot your eyes
under the ice.

783
01:15:55,072 --> 01:15:56,247
They needed me.

784
01:15:58,945 --> 01:16:01,687
It is a shock to see them
so many years later.

785
01:16:04,385 --> 01:16:05,343
They still need me.

786
01:16:06,605 --> 01:16:09,173
I am rather taken by them.

787
01:16:09,216 --> 01:16:11,131
-What do you want?
-Just a favor.

788
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:13,438
You owe me.

789
01:16:14,787 --> 01:16:16,615
You murdered my mother.

790
01:16:16,659 --> 01:16:19,400
And your father
killed my entire family.

791
01:16:22,142 --> 01:16:24,188
Parents.

792
01:16:24,231 --> 01:16:27,408
I need you to visit
someone for me,
wearing this.

793
01:16:29,236 --> 01:16:30,760
It's harmless to you.

794
01:16:35,678 --> 01:16:37,593
You are the only one
who can do it.

795
01:16:38,855 --> 01:16:39,769
No.

796
01:16:41,074 --> 01:16:43,163
Why would I do
anything for you?

797
01:16:43,207 --> 01:16:49,561
Because I am a man
willing to kill
the person you love most.

798
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:51,650
I've already lost everyone
I've ever loved.

799
01:16:53,521 --> 01:16:54,871
There is nothing
you can threaten me with.

800
01:16:57,700 --> 01:16:59,832
That is very sad to hear,
Madeleine.

801
01:17:05,708 --> 01:17:06,970
But it is not true...

802
01:17:12,628 --> 01:17:13,672
is it?

803
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:24,335
Madeleine Swann, really?

804
01:17:24,378 --> 01:17:26,946
Well, yes. We took
your information seriously,

805
01:17:26,990 --> 01:17:30,123
but that was five years ago.
Nothing came up.

806
01:17:30,167 --> 01:17:32,082
Well, she's very smart
and very good
at hiding things.

807
01:17:32,125 --> 01:17:33,474
She's a useful asset.

808
01:17:33,518 --> 01:17:36,477
She's the only psychiatrist
he agreed to speak to.

809
01:17:36,521 --> 01:17:37,957
I had to exercise
my judgment...

810
01:17:38,001 --> 01:17:39,045
Your judgment is the problem.

811
01:17:41,178 --> 01:17:43,571
That weapon was designed
to save lives

812
01:17:43,615 --> 01:17:45,878
and to eradicate
collateral damage
for our agents.

813
01:17:47,706 --> 01:17:49,708
A clean,
accurate shot every time.

814
01:17:51,101 --> 01:17:52,668
But it had to be off the books.

815
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:56,236
There are enough holes
in our national security.

816
01:17:58,151 --> 01:17:59,979
If the world knows
what this can do...

817
01:18:00,023 --> 01:18:01,807
-They'd kill for it.
-Mm.

818
01:18:02,939 --> 01:18:03,853
Look...

819
01:18:06,246 --> 01:18:10,598
If it's an error,
it's on my shoulders,
fair and square.

820
01:18:12,992 --> 01:18:14,820
I've dedicated my life
to defending this country.

821
01:18:16,779 --> 01:18:19,085
I believe in defending
the principles of this...

822
01:18:19,129 --> 01:18:20,521
Of this.

823
01:18:22,872 --> 01:18:25,004
But we used to be able to get
into a room with the enemy,

824
01:18:25,048 --> 01:18:25,918
we could look him in the eye.

825
01:18:27,180 --> 01:18:28,094
And now the...

826
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:33,970
The enemy
is just floating in the ether.

827
01:18:34,013 --> 01:18:34,927
We don't even know
what they're after.

828
01:18:36,189 --> 01:18:37,408
Blofeld.

829
01:18:39,236 --> 01:18:41,586
We managed to access
a database of their targets.

830
01:18:41,629 --> 01:18:42,718
"We"?

831
01:18:45,024 --> 01:18:46,112
Oh, for fuck's sake.

832
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:48,767
I see.

833
01:18:50,421 --> 01:18:51,770
And after Blofeld,
what do they want?

834
01:18:53,511 --> 01:18:54,991
Well, it's hard to say.

835
01:18:55,034 --> 01:18:56,601
I mean,
I would imagine world leaders,

836
01:18:56,644 --> 01:18:59,778
innocent civilians, freedom,
you know, that sort of thing.

837
01:18:59,822 --> 01:19:02,476
Oh, good,
well, just the usual.

838
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:04,217
Just the usual.

839
01:19:08,091 --> 01:19:11,007
Blofeld was communicating
with his agents in Cuba

840
01:19:11,050 --> 01:19:14,619
through a bionic eye
which we've now retrieved.

841
01:19:14,662 --> 01:19:17,187
You're welcome.

842
01:19:17,230 --> 01:19:21,278
Spectre's destruction's going
to have huge consequences.

843
01:19:21,321 --> 01:19:24,194
Whoever did this is going
to be very dangerous
and very powerful.

844
01:19:26,936 --> 01:19:29,416
We need all the information
that we can gather.

845
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:30,678
Sir.

846
01:19:31,984 --> 01:19:32,768
Sir.

847
01:19:34,813 --> 01:19:36,859
Bond.

848
01:19:36,902 --> 01:19:39,644
So the rumors are true.
You look well.

849
01:19:39,687 --> 01:19:40,776
Tanner.

850
01:19:41,951 --> 01:19:43,474
Sir,
there's been a development.

851
01:19:45,998 --> 01:19:47,608
They were
just dropping,

852
01:19:47,652 --> 01:19:48,740
one right after the other.

853
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:52,048
It was disturbing,
to say the least.

854
01:19:52,091 --> 01:19:54,528
Wait till you see
what it looks like up close.

855
01:19:54,572 --> 01:19:57,444
-Uh, Bond's in the office.
- What?

856
01:20:01,231 --> 01:20:04,756
Oh, Bond. My God,
I haven't seen you in,
in, uh...

857
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,584
-How is your retirement?
-Shut up, Q.

858
01:20:06,627 --> 01:20:08,455
I know he's staying with you.

859
01:20:08,499 --> 01:20:10,240
And you're not
in the clear either.

860
01:20:10,283 --> 01:20:12,242
-What happened?
-He's been reinstated
as a double-0.

861
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:16,855
-Double-0 what?
-What have you got?

862
01:20:19,945 --> 01:20:21,686
Q has studied
the blood samples I gathered

863
01:20:21,729 --> 01:20:23,470
from the victims
of the funeral.

864
01:20:23,514 --> 01:20:25,559
Just look at this.

865
01:20:25,603 --> 01:20:27,605
- What are we looking at?

866
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:28,954
This is the funeral

867
01:20:28,998 --> 01:20:31,565
of one of the dead
Spectre agents from Cuba.

868
01:20:31,609 --> 01:20:33,437
And here are
the members of their family

869
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:36,570
who made physical contact
with the corpse.

870
01:20:36,614 --> 01:20:39,008
We found Heracles
in the blood samples
of all of them.

871
01:20:41,401 --> 01:20:43,273
Now,
that's some good work, Nomi.

872
01:20:43,316 --> 01:20:45,275
Thank you, sir. Double-0 what?

873
01:20:45,318 --> 01:20:48,626
-What are they?
-They're... They're nanobots.

874
01:20:50,193 --> 01:20:51,629
Right.

875
01:20:51,672 --> 01:20:53,979
Microscopic bio-robots
that can enter your system

876
01:20:54,023 --> 01:20:55,415
by the slightest contact
with your skin.

877
01:21:01,334 --> 01:21:05,121
Programmed with DNA
to target specific individuals.

878
01:21:06,426 --> 01:21:07,863
Heracles was...

879
01:21:09,777 --> 01:21:13,738
It was designed to be
the most efficient weapon
in our arsenal.

880
01:21:13,781 --> 01:21:15,740
Passing through
people harmlessly

881
01:21:15,783 --> 01:21:18,090
before reaching
its intended target.

882
01:21:18,134 --> 01:21:20,397
But Obruchev
modified the nanobots

883
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:22,573
so that they can kill anyone
related to the target.

884
01:21:22,616 --> 01:21:24,488
-Anyone?
-Well, since it's DNA-based,

885
01:21:24,531 --> 01:21:25,924
with further modifications,
yes.

886
01:21:26,925 --> 01:21:30,102
Families,
certain genetic traits.

887
01:21:30,146 --> 01:21:32,844
Single-nucleotide variants
and polymorphisms

888
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:35,542
that could target a range
from individuals to...

889
01:21:35,586 --> 01:21:36,892
whole ethnicities.

890
01:21:37,762 --> 01:21:39,329
You infect enough people...

891
01:21:39,372 --> 01:21:41,418
And the people
become the weapon.

892
01:21:41,461 --> 01:21:44,029
It was never intended to be
a weapon of mass destruction.

893
01:21:46,162 --> 01:21:46,945
It was...

894
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:51,297
I need to call
the Prime Minister.

895
01:21:52,690 --> 01:21:55,127
Tanner, quarantine
the families from the funeral.

896
01:21:55,171 --> 01:21:56,737
-Yes, sir.
- And, Q,

897
01:21:56,781 --> 01:21:58,739
hack into Blofeld's bionic eye,

898
01:21:58,783 --> 01:21:59,915
see what you can find.

899
01:22:01,568 --> 01:22:03,266
-You've got your wish.

900
01:22:03,309 --> 01:22:06,095
Go to Blofeld and see
what you can get out of him.

901
01:22:06,138 --> 01:22:08,097
And find
that cockroach Obruchev.

902
01:22:09,011 --> 01:22:10,055
Sir.

903
01:22:13,754 --> 01:22:16,235
We don't have a trail.

904
01:22:16,279 --> 01:22:19,673
Logan Ash. State Department.
Ex-State Department.

905
01:22:19,717 --> 01:22:21,545
Find him,
you'll find Obruchev.

906
01:22:21,588 --> 01:22:22,807
Um...

907
01:22:23,982 --> 01:22:25,462
Good luck.

908
01:22:25,505 --> 01:22:27,768
Thanks.

909
01:22:53,881 --> 01:22:55,057
I'll be outside
when you're done

910
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:56,623
with your important
preparation.

911
01:22:59,626 --> 01:23:00,627
I'll be just a moment.

912
01:23:02,064 --> 01:23:03,065
It's fine.

913
01:23:22,736 --> 01:23:24,347
Blofeld's eyeball unlocked.

914
01:23:29,134 --> 01:23:31,919
Accessing
received media stream.

915
01:23:33,051 --> 01:23:35,271
I know you
and she have a history,

916
01:23:35,314 --> 01:23:38,491
but we've kept a close eye
on her over the years.

917
01:23:38,535 --> 01:23:40,015
She's been very compliant.

918
01:23:40,058 --> 01:23:41,538
If Bond does
anything weird in there,

919
01:23:41,581 --> 01:23:43,105
you'll be doing me
a huge favor,

920
01:23:43,148 --> 01:23:45,194
so don't make it too easy
for him, okay?

921
01:23:45,237 --> 01:23:46,717
Okay.

922
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:49,850
He's the most valuable asset
this country has.

923
01:23:49,894 --> 01:23:51,635
I know you and he
have a history,

924
01:23:51,678 --> 01:23:54,725
but don't let him get
in your head.

925
01:23:54,768 --> 01:23:56,335
If you feel yourself
losing control...

926
01:23:56,379 --> 01:23:59,469
Oh, Tanner, relax.

927
01:23:59,512 --> 01:24:00,818
I'm not gonna lose...

928
01:24:05,823 --> 01:24:07,085
control.

929
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:14,788
Dr. Swann, good afternoon.

930
01:24:20,533 --> 01:24:21,839
Mr. Bond.

931
01:24:26,322 --> 01:24:27,627
007.

932
01:24:32,676 --> 01:24:35,766
Six-seven.
Special cell two
now locked off.

933
01:24:40,988 --> 01:24:43,339
Segregation unit secure.

934
01:24:43,382 --> 01:24:45,776
This is where we leave you.
Good luck.

935
01:24:45,819 --> 01:24:47,125
Just get us a name.

936
01:24:54,654 --> 01:24:58,136
Must be nice to catch up
with an old friend
so regularly.

937
01:25:00,138 --> 01:25:02,401
-We're closer than ever.
-

938
01:25:02,445 --> 01:25:04,316
Oh, that was awkward.

939
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:05,752
Does he have that effect
on all women?

940
01:25:05,796 --> 01:25:08,103
Fifty-fifty.

941
01:25:08,146 --> 01:25:09,104
-It's unpredictable.
-Huh.

942
01:25:12,455 --> 01:25:14,109
Isolated in HSU.

943
01:25:23,205 --> 01:25:24,206
You're shaking.

944
01:25:25,946 --> 01:25:27,513
It's not an ideal situation.

945
01:25:57,717 --> 01:25:59,154
Open the door.

946
01:26:00,459 --> 01:26:01,373
Open the door!

947
01:26:02,896 --> 01:26:04,724
-Don't.
-What is it?

948
01:26:06,248 --> 01:26:09,207
James,
you don't know what this is.

949
01:26:10,469 --> 01:26:11,775
Don't make me do this.

950
01:26:11,818 --> 01:26:13,690
Please.

951
01:26:13,733 --> 01:26:14,908
Right. Open the doors.

952
01:26:14,952 --> 01:26:16,649
-Open the door.
-Open it.

953
01:26:16,693 --> 01:26:17,824
What...

954
01:26:21,219 --> 01:26:22,220
Where are you going?

955
01:26:23,569 --> 01:26:24,614
Home.

956
01:26:28,705 --> 01:26:30,402
I'll get her.
- Wait.

957
01:26:30,446 --> 01:26:32,404
-He won't talk without her.
-Just wait.

958
01:26:34,928 --> 01:26:35,668
Special delivery.

959
01:26:52,729 --> 01:26:53,251
James.

960
01:26:54,557 --> 01:26:55,210
Hello, Blofeld.

961
01:26:57,995 --> 01:27:00,432
Perhaps you can help me.

962
01:27:02,913 --> 01:27:04,697
Cuba was quite the party.

963
01:27:04,741 --> 01:27:07,483
-Happy birthday, by the way.
-Thank you.

964
01:27:07,526 --> 01:27:09,398
I'm trying to piece together
what happened.

965
01:27:11,095 --> 01:27:13,228
I mean, there you were,
or here you were,

966
01:27:13,271 --> 01:27:15,665
with the world's
most powerful people,

967
01:27:15,708 --> 01:27:19,669
your friends, all in one room,
a noose around my neck,

968
01:27:19,712 --> 01:27:22,237
and your hands on the most
valuable weapon in existence.

969
01:27:23,890 --> 01:27:26,110
It's like a...

970
01:27:26,153 --> 01:27:29,766
It was like a testimony
to your greatness.

971
01:27:29,809 --> 01:27:34,205
A celebration of all
that is Ernst Stavro Blofeld.

972
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:36,076
Yeah, James.
-

973
01:27:37,687 --> 01:27:39,776
Yeah.

974
01:27:39,819 --> 01:27:42,257
But then it all went wrong,
didn't it?

975
01:27:44,302 --> 01:27:47,523
My sweet James,
what do you want?

976
01:27:47,566 --> 01:27:48,959
Your enemies
are closing in, Blofeld.

977
01:27:50,830 --> 01:27:52,484
And the biggest twist here

978
01:27:52,528 --> 01:27:54,530
is that if you tell me
who they are,

979
01:27:55,966 --> 01:27:57,576
I could save your life.

980
01:27:57,620 --> 01:28:00,753
Mm, my avenging angel.

981
01:28:00,797 --> 01:28:03,278
My chaser of lost causes.

982
01:28:03,321 --> 01:28:06,281
Now you even chase mine.

983
01:28:06,324 --> 01:28:08,108
But you're asking
the wrong question.

984
01:28:08,152 --> 01:28:10,720
Yeah,
Cuba was a disappointment,

985
01:28:10,763 --> 01:28:13,505
but we all cry on our birthday.

986
01:28:13,549 --> 01:28:15,333
You need to ask yourself,

987
01:28:15,377 --> 01:28:17,814
why are we here?

988
01:28:17,857 --> 01:28:20,295
Accessing media file 472.

989
01:28:22,209 --> 01:28:24,299
Hmm. Looking sharp, Bond.

990
01:28:24,342 --> 01:28:25,561
473.

991
01:28:26,953 --> 01:28:28,303
474.

992
01:28:29,739 --> 01:28:31,523
475.

993
01:28:33,351 --> 01:28:36,528
476, 477, 478.

994
01:28:40,793 --> 01:28:42,317
479.

995
01:28:50,368 --> 01:28:52,762
Logan Ash.
A pleasure to meet you.

996
01:28:52,805 --> 01:28:54,024
Oh, my God, that's him.

997
01:28:54,067 --> 01:28:55,765
I am sorry
for your loss.

998
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:58,550
I believe you know
who I represent and work for?

999
01:28:58,594 --> 01:29:00,813
We have an opportunity for you.

1000
01:29:02,032 --> 01:29:03,120
You keep
coming back to me.

1001
01:29:03,163 --> 01:29:04,774
I thought
I'd never see you again,

1002
01:29:04,817 --> 01:29:06,297
but fate draws
us back together.

1003
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:08,560
Yes. Q's got eyes on Logan Ash.

1004
01:29:09,692 --> 01:29:10,954
-Go.
-Yep.

1005
01:29:10,997 --> 01:29:12,434
Let me know what happens.

1006
01:29:12,477 --> 01:29:13,913
Now your enemy
is my enemy.

1007
01:29:13,957 --> 01:29:15,393
How did that happen?

1008
01:29:15,437 --> 01:29:17,656
Well, you live long enough...

1009
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:20,311
Yeah. Look at us.
-

1010
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:21,791
Two old men in a hole

1011
01:29:21,834 --> 01:29:23,836
trying to work out
who's playing tricks on us.

1012
01:29:27,666 --> 01:29:30,452
She still loves you.
Did you know that?

1013
01:29:30,495 --> 01:29:32,410
And you broke her heart.
And she betrayed you.

1014
01:29:32,454 --> 01:29:34,194
She is irrelevant.

1015
01:29:34,238 --> 01:29:37,720
Mm, I wouldn't be
so quick to dismiss.

1016
01:29:37,763 --> 01:29:40,810
You said it yourself,
she's very good
at hiding things.

1017
01:29:40,853 --> 01:29:45,205
And when her secret
finds its way out,
and it will,

1018
01:29:45,249 --> 01:29:46,642
it'll be the death of you.

1019
01:29:46,685 --> 01:29:48,818
Just give me a name.

1020
01:29:48,861 --> 01:29:50,646
-Madeleine.
-

1021
01:29:50,689 --> 01:29:53,518
Please, just...
Please, no games.

1022
01:29:55,172 --> 01:29:56,216
Madeleine.

1023
01:29:58,567 --> 01:30:01,134
Oh, do you know what?
The two of you
should come see me.

1024
01:30:01,178 --> 01:30:03,485
A little couples therapy.

1025
01:30:03,528 --> 01:30:06,357
I simply have to see your face
when she tells you the truth.

1026
01:30:06,401 --> 01:30:09,578
Just tell me
who they are, Blofeld...

1027
01:30:11,928 --> 01:30:14,278
and then I'll leave.
I'll leave you on your own.

1028
01:30:14,321 --> 01:30:16,411
No, I don't want you to leave.

1029
01:30:16,454 --> 01:30:17,629
We're just getting
reacquainted.

1030
01:30:24,114 --> 01:30:25,811
Hmm. All right. Come.

1031
01:30:27,596 --> 01:30:31,077
You were unusually patient.
I need to give you something

1032
01:30:31,121 --> 01:30:33,428
so that you didn't have to make
all this way for nothing. Come.

1033
01:30:39,956 --> 01:30:40,696
Careful, Bond.

1034
01:30:41,914 --> 01:30:42,480
It was me.

1035
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:47,180
-You destroyed Spectre?
- No.

1036
01:30:47,224 --> 01:30:49,487
Vesper's grave.

1037
01:30:49,531 --> 01:30:51,315
Madeleine didn't do a thing.
It was all me.

1038
01:30:51,358 --> 01:30:53,578
I knew you'd come visit it,

1039
01:30:53,622 --> 01:30:56,363
I just needed to wait
for the bon moment.

1040
01:30:56,407 --> 01:30:57,756
She led you straight there

1041
01:30:57,800 --> 01:30:59,932
from the goodness
of her heart.

1042
01:30:59,976 --> 01:31:02,935
And then you left her, for me.

1043
01:31:02,979 --> 01:31:05,285
-It doesn't matter.
-Oh, but it does.

1044
01:31:05,329 --> 01:31:07,070
She still does, doesn't she?

1045
01:31:07,113 --> 01:31:09,289
My poor little cuckoo.

1046
01:31:10,769 --> 01:31:13,642
You were always so very,
very sensitive.

1047
01:31:17,123 --> 01:31:18,081
This isn't working.

1048
01:31:18,124 --> 01:31:19,474
Keep going.

1049
01:31:19,517 --> 01:31:21,301
All this wasted time,

1050
01:31:21,345 --> 01:31:23,434
the life you could have had.

1051
01:31:23,478 --> 01:31:26,132
And the reason all of this
is so beautiful,

1052
01:31:26,176 --> 01:31:28,221
so exquisitely beautiful,

1053
01:31:28,265 --> 01:31:30,746
is that you're coming
to me looking for answers,

1054
01:31:30,789 --> 01:31:33,792
whereas the one person
who knows it all is she.

1055
01:31:33,836 --> 01:31:37,361
It's Madeleine. She holds
the secrets you need.

1056
01:31:37,404 --> 01:31:40,016
All of them.
I didn't need to kill you.

1057
01:31:40,059 --> 01:31:41,670
I'd already broken you.

1058
01:31:41,713 --> 01:31:43,759
I wanted to give you
an empty world...

1059
01:31:45,325 --> 01:31:47,589
like the one you gave me.

1060
01:31:47,632 --> 01:31:49,373
It's enough
to almost make me regret it.

1061
01:31:50,766 --> 01:31:51,680
Eh, almost.

1062
01:32:00,297 --> 01:32:01,080
Die.

1063
01:32:03,039 --> 01:32:03,648
Hmm?

1064
01:32:06,564 --> 01:32:08,697
Die, Blofeld. Die.
-

1065
01:32:08,740 --> 01:32:10,089
Jesus. Open the door.

1066
01:32:12,048 --> 01:32:14,659
-Bond! Bond! Bond!

1067
01:32:14,703 --> 01:32:18,533
-Open the door. Bond!

1068
01:32:18,576 --> 01:32:20,230
-Cuckoo.
-

1069
01:32:20,273 --> 01:32:21,536
What the hell
are you thinking?

1070
01:32:21,579 --> 01:32:23,146
Yes, yes, yes, I know how
to interrogate an asset.

1071
01:32:23,189 --> 01:32:26,018
-This interrogation is over.
-Tanner, don't lecture me!

1072
01:32:26,062 --> 01:32:28,412
Bond, you have violated
the most important rule

1073
01:32:28,455 --> 01:32:29,935
in the whole bloody playbook.

1074
01:32:36,638 --> 01:32:37,639
Don't move.

1075
01:32:47,997 --> 01:32:49,781
I'm... I'm gonna need those,
I'm afraid.

1076
01:33:01,837 --> 01:33:02,577
He's dead.

1077
01:33:05,231 --> 01:33:07,451
It's a good thing
you're not actually related,

1078
01:33:07,494 --> 01:33:08,583
or you'd be dead too.

1079
01:33:10,236 --> 01:33:12,369
-How do I get this off?
- Oh, you don't. You can't.

1080
01:33:14,501 --> 01:33:17,548
Nanobots aren't just
for Christmas.

1081
01:33:17,592 --> 01:33:21,508
Once Heracles
is in your system,
it's there forever.

1082
01:33:27,297 --> 01:33:28,777
Did they find the car?

1083
01:33:28,820 --> 01:33:30,822
We traced it,
but she abandoned it.

1084
01:33:30,866 --> 01:33:32,737
They searched her flat,
she hasn't been home.

1085
01:33:34,391 --> 01:33:36,567
-Is she one of them?
-I don't know.

1086
01:33:36,611 --> 01:33:40,397
James, do you have any idea
where she might have gone?

1087
01:33:42,268 --> 01:33:44,270
No. I don't know her at all.

1088
01:34:31,187 --> 01:34:32,579
Is that for me?

1089
01:34:34,930 --> 01:34:35,931
No.

1090
01:34:38,977 --> 01:34:40,326
Then why did you come?

1091
01:34:41,588 --> 01:34:42,894
Because you told me to.

1092
01:34:44,766 --> 01:34:47,333
I didn't think you
would remember.

1093
01:34:47,377 --> 01:34:49,292
I remember everything.

1094
01:34:49,335 --> 01:34:51,686
You need to tell me
who gave you
the poison, Madeleine.

1095
01:34:53,905 --> 01:34:54,906
Is he dead?

1096
01:34:56,299 --> 01:34:57,343
Yes, he's dead.

1097
01:34:58,475 --> 01:34:59,694
Good.

1098
01:35:02,697 --> 01:35:03,872
He told me
you didn't betray me.

1099
01:35:06,439 --> 01:35:07,876
I understand you're not built
to trust people.

1100
01:35:10,269 --> 01:35:13,185
-Neither are you.
-Then we were fools
for trying.

1101
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:15,710
I wanted to.

1102
01:35:22,934 --> 01:35:24,849
I don't know if you wanted me
to come here,

1103
01:35:26,721 --> 01:35:28,331
or why you tried
to kill Blofeld,

1104
01:35:28,374 --> 01:35:29,811
or who gave you
the poison to do it,

1105
01:35:29,854 --> 01:35:30,986
or how long you've been
working for them,

1106
01:35:31,029 --> 01:35:32,378
but I do know...

1107
01:35:35,251 --> 01:35:39,690
that for what felt
like five minutes of my life

1108
01:35:39,734 --> 01:35:41,823
I wanted everything with you.

1109
01:35:44,651 --> 01:35:46,741
And it's not
because I didn't trust.

1110
01:35:49,744 --> 01:35:51,441
It was just that feeling.

1111
01:35:56,315 --> 01:35:58,753
I know I've come here
to find out who gave you
the poison.

1112
01:36:00,842 --> 01:36:02,757
But I'm not going to leave here
without you knowing

1113
01:36:04,323 --> 01:36:05,977
that I have loved you,

1114
01:36:07,587 --> 01:36:09,589
and I will love you,

1115
01:36:09,633 --> 01:36:13,419
and I do not regret
a single moment of my life

1116
01:36:13,463 --> 01:36:14,551
that led me to you.

1117
01:36:17,815 --> 01:36:19,251
Except when I put you
on that train.

1118
01:36:24,561 --> 01:36:25,780
Do you know
the worst thing about you?

1119
01:36:28,130 --> 01:36:29,218
My timing?

1120
01:36:31,829 --> 01:36:32,787
Don't.

1121
01:36:41,534 --> 01:36:43,580
My sense of humor?

1122
01:36:45,103 --> 01:36:45,974
Don't.

1123
01:36:50,326 --> 01:36:52,763
-What?
-You look...

1124
01:36:52,807 --> 01:36:54,025
You look incredible.

1125
01:37:06,733 --> 01:37:08,474
This is Mathilde.

1126
01:37:10,302 --> 01:37:11,651
Um...

1127
01:37:12,522 --> 01:37:14,219
Hello. I'm James.

1128
01:37:31,976 --> 01:37:35,850
Sir, we've located Logan Ash.
007 wants a word.

1129
01:37:35,893 --> 01:37:37,852
-Well done, 007.
-Thank you, sir.

1130
01:37:37,895 --> 01:37:39,810
Permission
for a capture or kill.

1131
01:37:39,854 --> 01:37:41,072
Have we cleared this
with the Americans?

1132
01:37:42,769 --> 01:37:44,902
Granted.
And thank you for asking.

1133
01:37:44,946 --> 01:37:47,122
By the book, sir.

1134
01:37:47,165 --> 01:37:48,863
Well, your predecessor
was less deferential.

1135
01:37:50,125 --> 01:37:53,911
To be fair,
Commander Bond
gave me the lead.

1136
01:37:53,955 --> 01:37:56,348
Well, I'm glad to see you two
getting along.

1137
01:37:56,392 --> 01:37:57,872
-Sir.
-

1138
01:37:57,915 --> 01:37:58,916
Have you located Dr. Swann?

1139
01:38:00,352 --> 01:38:02,093
Nothing, I'm afraid, sir.

1140
01:38:02,137 --> 01:38:02,877
Thank you.

1141
01:38:33,211 --> 01:38:34,038
She's not yours.

1142
01:38:36,127 --> 01:38:37,433
But, um, the...

1143
01:38:37,476 --> 01:38:38,738
Okay, the blue eyes, the...

1144
01:38:40,392 --> 01:38:41,698
She's not yours.

1145
01:38:44,222 --> 01:38:44,962
Okay.

1146
01:38:46,746 --> 01:38:47,704
I have something to show you.

1147
01:38:51,403 --> 01:38:52,796
Another child?

1148
01:39:04,503 --> 01:39:07,332
What is it
with your dad
and secret rooms?

1149
01:39:07,376 --> 01:39:08,072
Talk to me.

1150
01:39:09,813 --> 01:39:10,945
I wanted
to bring you here before.

1151
01:39:12,642 --> 01:39:13,948
To tell you everything.

1152
01:39:15,601 --> 01:39:17,125
Blofeld ordered my father

1153
01:39:17,168 --> 01:39:18,953
to assassinate this family.

1154
01:39:18,996 --> 01:39:20,650
The boy survived.

1155
01:39:22,782 --> 01:39:23,958
His name is Lyutsifer Safin.

1156
01:39:28,658 --> 01:39:30,965
When I was a little girl,
he came here
to kill my father.

1157
01:39:33,184 --> 01:39:35,012
But he found me
and my mother instead.

1158
01:39:37,667 --> 01:39:38,363
He spared my life.

1159
01:39:40,975 --> 01:39:42,802
And now he's back.

1160
01:39:42,846 --> 01:39:45,196
-And what does he want?
-Revenge.

1161
01:39:47,546 --> 01:39:48,547
Me.

1162
01:39:54,640 --> 01:39:57,426
-Who were they?
-Spectre's poisoners.

1163
01:39:57,469 --> 01:39:59,515
My father held
a banquet for them,

1164
01:39:59,558 --> 01:40:02,170
used their own recipe
in the dessert.

1165
01:40:02,213 --> 01:40:03,084
Dioxin.

1166
01:40:04,999 --> 01:40:06,957
They would have
suffered horribly.

1167
01:40:07,001 --> 01:40:08,132
Scarred him for life.

1168
01:40:09,873 --> 01:40:11,048
The family had an island.

1169
01:40:12,919 --> 01:40:15,009
They called it
the Poison Garden.

1170
01:40:16,358 --> 01:40:17,968
Oh, so...

1171
01:40:18,012 --> 01:40:20,231
Blofeld took it from them,
and kept running it,

1172
01:40:22,016 --> 01:40:23,800
and now this Safin
has taken it back.

1173
01:40:29,806 --> 01:40:33,288
Q, find one Lyutsifer Safin.

1174
01:40:33,331 --> 01:40:35,855
Whereabouts unknown
and no recent photographs,

1175
01:40:35,899 --> 01:40:38,554
but I'm gonna send you
some images of him as a boy.

1176
01:40:38,597 --> 01:40:42,558
And a picture of an island.
So, you know, do your best.

1177
01:40:42,601 --> 01:40:45,039
And I'm gonna need a plane
to get there, a big one.

1178
01:40:49,130 --> 01:40:50,522
I'll send you
my location shortly.

1179
01:40:55,310 --> 01:40:56,833
You're going to find him?

1180
01:40:59,575 --> 01:41:02,447
There are a thousand reasons
why we need to find this man.

1181
01:41:04,971 --> 01:41:07,061
You just gave me a reason
to kill him.

1182
01:41:42,966 --> 01:41:43,488
How is it?

1183
01:41:58,199 --> 01:41:59,722
Excuse me.

1184
01:41:59,765 --> 01:42:01,158
-Yes?
-Bond.

1185
01:42:01,202 --> 01:42:02,812
Did you find the island?

1186
01:42:02,855 --> 01:42:05,075
Yes, it's part of a chain

1187
01:42:05,119 --> 01:42:07,425
in disputed waters
between Japan and Russia.

1188
01:42:07,469 --> 01:42:11,342
There's a chemical plant
dating back
to the Second World War,

1189
01:42:11,386 --> 01:42:12,909
seems to have had
quite a history.

1190
01:42:12,952 --> 01:42:15,346
Sir, Japanese intelligence

1191
01:42:15,390 --> 01:42:17,435
have reported suspicious
activity on the island.

1192
01:42:17,479 --> 01:42:21,178
Q, bring up
the satellite images
I just sent through.

1193
01:42:21,222 --> 01:42:22,832
These were taken
over the last few days.

1194
01:42:25,922 --> 01:42:28,881
-If that is Safin there...
-Then Heracles is there too.

1195
01:42:28,925 --> 01:42:30,579
Where do you need
this plane, Bond?

1196
01:42:30,622 --> 01:42:33,582
Hang on, Q. Did 007 manage
to locate Logan Ash?

1197
01:42:33,625 --> 01:42:36,150
She's closing in on him.
I'll send you her location.

1198
01:42:44,506 --> 01:42:47,161
I thought she
was following Logan Ash,
not me.

1199
01:42:47,204 --> 01:42:48,684
What? She is.

1200
01:42:48,727 --> 01:42:50,207
James, where are you?

1201
01:42:55,299 --> 01:42:56,561
Put her in the back.

1202
01:42:58,259 --> 01:42:59,999
There you are.
In here. Watch your head.

1203
01:43:14,362 --> 01:43:16,973
Q, I am gonna
need that plane, quickly.

1204
01:43:17,016 --> 01:43:18,409
I'm near Orland NATO base.

1205
01:43:18,453 --> 01:43:19,889
You think
you can get it to me?

1206
01:43:19,932 --> 01:43:21,412
Right. Right, yes.
We'll be there.

1207
01:43:21,456 --> 01:43:24,285
-Thank you.
- Mama.

1208
01:44:29,611 --> 01:44:30,916
James.

1209
01:44:44,365 --> 01:44:45,279
- Mathilde!

1210
01:45:54,652 --> 01:45:55,392
They're above us!

1211
01:46:23,420 --> 01:46:25,379
Get out of here! James!

1212
01:47:34,752 --> 01:47:36,667
-

1213
01:47:45,284 --> 01:47:46,503
-

1214
01:48:03,172 --> 01:48:04,129
You stay here.

1215
01:48:05,130 --> 01:48:07,568
I'll be back soon.

1216
01:48:07,611 --> 01:48:10,048
Anybody comes through
that door, you shoot them.

1217
01:48:10,092 --> 01:48:10,875
Unless it's me.

1218
01:48:12,790 --> 01:48:14,662
You be quiet, okay?
Stay really quiet.

1219
01:49:02,448 --> 01:49:04,407
-

1220
01:49:47,668 --> 01:49:48,669
Go! Go!

1221
01:49:55,676 --> 01:49:56,459
There! Run him over!

1222
01:50:27,838 --> 01:50:29,797
You won't be able
to stop him...

1223
01:50:32,495 --> 01:50:34,628
...so why don't you help
me out, brother?

1224
01:50:34,671 --> 01:50:35,803
I had a brother.

1225
01:50:38,501 --> 01:50:39,676
His name was Felix Leiter.

1226
01:52:02,628 --> 01:52:03,151
Need a ride?

1227
01:52:04,761 --> 01:52:06,545
Where have you been?

1228
01:52:06,589 --> 01:52:08,547
Chasing after your lead.

1229
01:52:11,986 --> 01:52:13,944
-Ash?
-Dead.

1230
01:52:17,208 --> 01:52:18,296
They took Dr. Swann.

1231
01:52:19,428 --> 01:52:20,734
And her daughter.

1232
01:52:23,258 --> 01:52:26,304
I... I didn't know
she had a daughter.

1233
01:52:26,348 --> 01:52:27,741
Did M get my plane?

1234
01:52:29,307 --> 01:52:31,657
Our plane.
I'm coming with you.

1235
01:52:34,399 --> 01:52:35,966
Thank you, 007.

1236
01:52:59,685 --> 01:53:01,949
-Hello, Q.
- Bond.

1237
01:53:03,864 --> 01:53:04,995
Sorry to get you
out of bed.

1238
01:53:07,345 --> 01:53:10,044
The objectives
of this mission are threefold.

1239
01:53:10,087 --> 01:53:12,307
Confirm the presence
of Heracles.

1240
01:53:12,350 --> 01:53:14,309
Kill Obruchev and Safin.

1241
01:53:14,352 --> 01:53:17,486
Get Dr. Swann and her daughter
off the island.

1242
01:53:17,529 --> 01:53:20,315
And, Bond,
I hope they're there.

1243
01:53:20,358 --> 01:53:22,665
-Thank you, sir.
-Sir.

1244
01:53:25,233 --> 01:53:27,975
Permission for Commander Bond
to be redesignated as 007.

1245
01:53:31,413 --> 01:53:32,370
It's just a number.

1246
01:53:32,414 --> 01:53:33,937
Very well. Agreed.

1247
01:53:35,634 --> 01:53:37,114
Good luck.

1248
01:53:37,158 --> 01:53:38,724
Bond, your watch.

1249
01:53:41,945 --> 01:53:46,080
It contains a limited-radius
electromagnetic pulse.

1250
01:53:46,123 --> 01:53:48,256
It'll short any circuit
in a hardwired network

1251
01:53:48,299 --> 01:53:49,823
-if you get close enough.
- Mm-hmm.

1252
01:53:51,650 --> 01:53:52,869
And how strong is it?

1253
01:53:53,870 --> 01:53:56,438
It's fairly strong.

1254
01:53:56,481 --> 01:53:58,092
"Fairly strong,"
what's that mean?

1255
01:53:58,135 --> 01:54:00,050
We haven't had the chance
to test it properly,
just be careful.

1256
01:54:01,312 --> 01:54:03,532
Right, this is Q-DAR.

1257
01:54:03,575 --> 01:54:05,055
It will map the space
as you move through it.

1258
01:54:07,928 --> 01:54:08,842
Don't touch that.

1259
01:54:10,582 --> 01:54:13,542
And smart blood
will track you...

1260
01:54:13,585 --> 01:54:15,283
Whoops. And your vitals.

1261
01:54:22,333 --> 01:54:25,032
Bond, you don't mind
a shot or two
whilst at work?

1262
01:54:25,075 --> 01:54:26,511
-Shall we?
-Well, I haven't had a drink

1263
01:54:26,555 --> 01:54:28,165
for three or four hou...

1264
01:54:28,209 --> 01:54:30,080
-Hours.
-Wow.

1265
01:54:30,124 --> 01:54:32,691
Doesn't sound like you.

1266
01:54:35,390 --> 01:54:37,696
-Ow!
-Good.

1267
01:54:37,740 --> 01:54:39,307
I assume you know
how the stealthy bird works.

1268
01:54:39,350 --> 01:54:40,786
No, no idea.

1269
01:54:41,526 --> 01:54:42,527
Gravity.

1270
01:55:03,113 --> 01:55:04,810
Welcome back, Mr. Safin.

1271
01:55:05,724 --> 01:55:07,901
Welcome to your family.

1272
01:55:07,944 --> 01:55:09,728
How are you progressing?

1273
01:55:09,772 --> 01:55:11,774
So, so good, Mr. Safin.
So, so good.

1274
01:55:11,817 --> 01:55:15,082
-My request?
-Svetlana?

1275
01:55:23,525 --> 01:55:25,919
Continue.

1276
01:55:25,962 --> 01:55:27,877
-What is that?
-Insurance.

1277
01:55:27,921 --> 01:55:30,227
A simple hair falls
from your head

1278
01:55:30,271 --> 01:55:31,750
and now I have your life
in my hands.

1279
01:55:34,231 --> 01:55:35,102
And yours.

1280
01:55:37,452 --> 01:55:39,976
How damaged you must be
to threaten a little girl.

1281
01:55:41,804 --> 01:55:43,414
You're any less damaged?

1282
01:55:44,981 --> 01:55:46,069
You love a killer.

1283
01:55:48,202 --> 01:55:51,988
You bore his child
despite his rejection.

1284
01:55:52,032 --> 01:55:53,990
You've hidden
and lied your whole life.

1285
01:55:54,034 --> 01:55:56,558
You will do anything...

1286
01:55:56,601 --> 01:55:57,341
To survive.

1287
01:56:01,955 --> 01:56:03,957
You understand me
the same way I understand you.

1288
01:56:07,438 --> 01:56:08,222
Move.

1289
01:56:18,493 --> 01:56:20,016
My father's garden.

1290
01:56:20,060 --> 01:56:22,714
It was his toxic treasure.

1291
01:56:22,758 --> 01:56:24,847
Let me show her.

1292
01:56:24,890 --> 01:56:27,110
-Give her to me.
-No.

1293
01:56:29,634 --> 01:56:30,896
I can protect her.

1294
01:56:34,988 --> 01:56:36,424
Mathilde.

1295
01:56:45,694 --> 01:56:47,391
Mathilde.

1296
01:56:47,435 --> 01:56:49,176
It's a poison garden...

1297
01:56:50,742 --> 01:56:52,396
but it's perfectly safe.

1298
01:56:54,833 --> 01:56:57,314
My father made this.

1299
01:56:57,358 --> 01:57:00,665
He loved his plants so much,
he would sing to them.

1300
01:57:04,321 --> 01:57:05,801
I want to show you
one of my favorites.

1301
01:57:10,284 --> 01:57:13,069
Some of these plants
are very dangerous,

1302
01:57:13,113 --> 01:57:15,289
but not all of them
are for hurting people.

1303
01:57:15,332 --> 01:57:18,118
I have plants that can do
all sorts of things.

1304
01:57:24,950 --> 01:57:26,126
Mathilde!

1305
01:57:27,301 --> 01:57:28,084
No.

1306
01:57:30,043 --> 01:57:31,609
This one makes you do
as you're told,

1307
01:57:33,133 --> 01:57:34,743
so you never misbehave,

1308
01:57:34,786 --> 01:57:36,353
and you're always good.

1309
01:57:36,397 --> 01:57:38,051
You mustn't misbehave,
Mathilde.

1310
01:57:40,009 --> 01:57:41,184
And neither must your mother.

1311
01:57:44,057 --> 01:57:45,058
Ever.

1312
01:57:48,713 --> 01:57:50,628
-Do you like it here?
- No.

1313
01:57:52,108 --> 01:57:53,240
Well, you will learn to.

1314
01:57:54,545 --> 01:57:55,546
I grew up here,

1315
01:57:55,590 --> 01:57:56,765
and you will too.

1316
01:58:00,986 --> 01:58:02,292
Such a beautiful child.

1317
01:58:05,556 --> 01:58:06,862
Perhaps we should
have some tea.

1318
01:58:06,905 --> 01:58:08,733
-No.
-Make her see the light.

1319
01:58:08,777 --> 01:58:10,561
No,
you can't separate us!

1320
01:58:10,605 --> 01:58:11,736
-Mathilde!
-Mama!

1321
01:58:17,438 --> 01:58:18,308
Don't worry.

1322
01:58:20,789 --> 01:58:21,790
You have me.

1323
01:58:31,756 --> 01:58:33,802
As soon as you have
a line of sight on the island,

1324
01:58:33,845 --> 01:58:35,543
drop altitude,
stay below radar.

1325
01:58:40,852 --> 01:58:42,115
You ever flown
one of these things before?

1326
01:58:43,638 --> 01:58:44,508
Nope.

1327
01:58:51,602 --> 01:58:53,430
Don't forget
to release the chute,

1328
01:58:53,474 --> 01:58:55,215
and open the wings.

1329
01:58:55,258 --> 01:58:56,172
Gravity isn't always
your friend.

1330
01:59:13,233 --> 01:59:15,191
Look for a concrete structure
on the west side
of the island.

1331
01:59:16,584 --> 01:59:17,846
That's your best bet
for getting in.

1332
02:00:04,501 --> 02:00:06,721
Coming up for air, Q.

1333
02:00:06,764 --> 02:00:08,505
Right, good.

1334
02:00:08,549 --> 02:00:11,378
You should be entering
a World War II-era sub pen.

1335
02:00:13,118 --> 02:00:14,381
Doesn't seem
to get much activity,

1336
02:00:14,424 --> 02:00:15,773
but look out
for cameras anyway.

1337
02:00:17,035 --> 02:00:18,385
Use your watch, Bond.

1338
02:00:53,985 --> 02:00:55,378
Okay. Ah, there you go.

1339
02:00:57,119 --> 02:01:00,165
-Sir, they're in.
-Yes, we have it.

1340
02:01:00,209 --> 02:01:02,820
You should be able
to see the chemical plant's
architecture.

1341
02:01:02,864 --> 02:01:05,823
Which one's Bond?
- He's the... He's the psi.

1342
02:01:05,867 --> 02:01:08,913
-He's the trident thingy.
- Give us the layout.

1343
02:01:11,612 --> 02:01:15,224
You're at the edge
of a toxic merry-go-round.

1344
02:01:15,268 --> 02:01:18,096
The main activity should
be towards the central hub,

1345
02:01:18,140 --> 02:01:19,272
which is directly above you.

1346
02:01:41,032 --> 02:01:42,469
-

1347
02:01:52,870 --> 02:01:54,524
Bond.

1348
02:01:54,568 --> 02:01:56,178
Bond, there's something...

1349
02:01:56,221 --> 02:01:58,006
There's something
big up ahead,

1350
02:01:58,049 --> 02:01:59,355
I can't work out what it is.
It's...

1351
02:02:00,965 --> 02:02:01,792
These walls
must be thick.

1352
02:02:08,582 --> 02:02:09,409
Bond.

1353
02:02:11,062 --> 02:02:12,977
Bond? 007, do you read me?

1354
02:02:13,021 --> 02:02:15,371
We've lost them.

1355
02:02:15,415 --> 02:02:17,199
They've entered
a blind spot, sir.

1356
02:02:17,242 --> 02:02:18,983
I can't work out what it is
they've walked into.

1357
02:02:19,027 --> 02:02:20,507
Well, just get them back.

1358
02:02:53,670 --> 02:02:55,542
Well,
will you look at those doors.

1359
02:02:56,586 --> 02:02:58,109
This was a missile silo.

1360
02:02:58,153 --> 02:02:59,154
Right.

1361
02:03:01,199 --> 02:03:02,375
Let's go.

1362
02:03:09,947 --> 02:03:12,167
Everybody, over there!
In the corner! Now!

1363
02:03:12,210 --> 02:03:14,865
-What? How?
- Move!

1364
02:03:14,909 --> 02:03:16,432
Move! On the ground!

1365
02:03:18,391 --> 02:03:20,131
Alarm.

1366
02:03:20,175 --> 02:03:21,785
-

1367
02:03:21,829 --> 02:03:22,873
Down, boy.

1368
02:03:40,325 --> 02:03:42,719
What... What are you doing?

1369
02:03:42,763 --> 02:03:46,157
You cannot explode
laboratory, please.

1370
02:03:46,201 --> 02:03:48,203
-

1371
02:03:50,292 --> 02:03:54,470
This is suicide mission.
Come on.

1372
02:03:54,514 --> 02:03:56,603
You will never leave
this island alive.

1373
02:04:03,218 --> 02:04:04,132
That was the farm.

1374
02:04:05,742 --> 02:04:07,352
And this is the factory.

1375
02:04:20,540 --> 02:04:22,150
They're mass-producing it.

1376
02:04:22,193 --> 02:04:23,673
Nomi, come and look at this.

1377
02:04:23,717 --> 02:04:26,154
Well, look,
you cannot stop it, mister.

1378
02:04:26,197 --> 02:04:28,504
We have big plan, you know.

1379
02:04:28,548 --> 02:04:30,071
-We have big numbers.
-What is it?

1380
02:04:30,114 --> 02:04:31,551
It's a simulation.

1381
02:04:31,594 --> 02:04:33,291
They're not
just attacking individuals.

1382
02:04:33,335 --> 02:04:35,555
They're going to kill millions.

1383
02:04:35,598 --> 02:04:37,992
It will not fit
in a suitcase this time, lady.

1384
02:04:38,035 --> 02:04:39,994
He's really getting
on my nerves.

1385
02:04:40,037 --> 02:04:40,864
Well, shut him up.

1386
02:04:42,823 --> 02:04:45,347
Ow!

1387
02:04:45,390 --> 02:04:46,914
My nose.

1388
02:04:50,657 --> 02:04:53,747
We have
to destroy this whole facility.

1389
02:04:53,790 --> 02:04:55,096
There is no need for violence.

1390
02:04:55,139 --> 02:04:57,490
Mr. Safin,
they use explosives.

1391
02:04:57,533 --> 02:04:59,492
Shut up.
- Mr. Bond,

1392
02:05:01,145 --> 02:05:04,714
you have something of mine
and I have something of yours.

1393
02:05:06,368 --> 02:05:09,153
Why don't you come up
and we can talk about it?

1394
02:05:09,197 --> 02:05:10,067
Like adults.

1395
02:05:12,983 --> 02:05:14,507
Safin, where is he?

1396
02:05:20,251 --> 02:05:21,601
If I don't come back,

1397
02:05:23,211 --> 02:05:24,342
blow it all to shit.

1398
02:05:25,648 --> 02:05:26,780
We don't have enough
explosives for that.

1399
02:05:26,823 --> 02:05:28,695
Yeah, but they don't know that.

1400
02:05:31,785 --> 02:05:32,568
Huh.

1401
02:05:43,274 --> 02:05:45,189
-

1402
02:05:47,409 --> 02:05:49,585
He said you must drink.

1403
02:05:49,629 --> 02:05:51,674
-For your health.
- Do you trust him?

1404
02:05:51,718 --> 02:05:54,634
He made me kill
your last master.

1405
02:05:54,677 --> 02:05:56,505
Why do you think
he let you join him?

1406
02:05:56,549 --> 02:05:59,726
I think he wants you to drink.

1407
02:06:02,642 --> 02:06:05,296
I want him to give me
my daughter back.

1408
02:06:05,340 --> 02:06:08,386
He said if you behave,
you'll see her. Drink.

1409
02:06:19,049 --> 02:06:20,398
Do you know
what this flower does?

1410
02:06:26,404 --> 02:06:27,754
It makes you blind.

1411
02:06:29,494 --> 02:06:31,322
Just a drop of this
in your eye,

1412
02:06:31,366 --> 02:06:32,759
and you'll never see again.

1413
02:06:35,413 --> 02:06:37,198
Losing one eye is a tragedy.

1414
02:06:37,241 --> 02:06:38,808
Losing two...

1415
02:06:38,852 --> 02:06:40,984
-No games.
-This is not a game.

1416
02:07:20,110 --> 02:07:20,633
Welcome.

1417
02:07:22,939 --> 02:07:23,679
On the floor.

1418
02:07:32,993 --> 02:07:33,820
Your sidearm.

1419
02:07:35,865 --> 02:07:36,649
Careful.

1420
02:07:42,219 --> 02:07:44,657
-She is light as a feather.
- All right!

1421
02:07:56,146 --> 02:07:56,843
Please, sit.

1422
02:08:03,980 --> 02:08:05,765
It's going to be all right.

1423
02:08:05,808 --> 02:08:07,592
Promise you,
it's going to be all right.

1424
02:08:08,593 --> 02:08:10,857
James Bond.

1425
02:08:10,900 --> 02:08:13,294
History of violence.

1426
02:08:13,337 --> 02:08:14,861
License to kill.

1427
02:08:15,992 --> 02:08:18,603
Vendetta with Ernst Blofeld.

1428
02:08:18,647 --> 02:08:20,344
In love with Madeleine Swann.

1429
02:08:22,782 --> 02:08:24,914
I could be speaking
to my own reflection.

1430
02:08:24,958 --> 02:08:27,177
We've made
slightly different choices.

1431
02:08:27,221 --> 02:08:30,877
No. We've just developed
different methods
for the same goal.

1432
02:08:32,617 --> 02:08:35,533
Only your skills die
with your body.

1433
02:08:35,577 --> 02:08:38,972
Mine will survive
long after I'm gone.

1434
02:08:39,015 --> 02:08:41,975
And life is all about
leaving something behind.

1435
02:08:44,542 --> 02:08:45,369
Isn't it?

1436
02:08:47,067 --> 02:08:48,721
Doesn't have to be ugly.

1437
02:08:50,287 --> 02:08:52,768
You leave my baby alone,
I leave yours.

1438
02:08:52,812 --> 02:08:53,943
What do you think?

1439
02:08:57,381 --> 02:08:59,209
I think you're right.

1440
02:09:01,211 --> 02:09:02,430
Thank you.

1441
02:09:02,473 --> 02:09:03,736
I think we are the same.

1442
02:09:05,041 --> 02:09:06,739
We both know
what it feels like

1443
02:09:06,782 --> 02:09:09,045
to have everything
taken from us

1444
02:09:09,089 --> 02:09:12,048
before we're even
in the fight.

1445
02:09:12,092 --> 02:09:16,749
It would have been nice
to have a chance,

1446
02:09:16,792 --> 02:09:18,881
you know, don't you think?

1447
02:09:18,925 --> 02:09:21,928
Just...
we all should get a chance.

1448
02:09:21,971 --> 02:09:24,495
But this thing
that you're building,

1449
02:09:24,539 --> 02:09:26,759
it puts everyone,

1450
02:09:26,802 --> 02:09:29,457
the whole world
on a battlefield.

1451
02:09:29,500 --> 02:09:31,328
Nobody gets a chance.

1452
02:09:34,767 --> 02:09:38,118
The thing
that no one wants to admit

1453
02:09:38,161 --> 02:09:42,165
is that most people want things
to happen to them.

1454
02:09:42,209 --> 02:09:45,429
We tell each other lies
about the fight for free will

1455
02:09:45,473 --> 02:09:47,040
and independence,

1456
02:09:47,083 --> 02:09:50,652
but we don't really want that.

1457
02:09:50,695 --> 02:09:52,001
We want to be told how to live,

1458
02:09:53,960 --> 02:09:55,700
and then die
when we are not looking.

1459
02:09:57,485 --> 02:10:00,053
People want oblivion,

1460
02:10:01,706 --> 02:10:04,840
and a few of us are born
to build it for them.

1461
02:10:07,060 --> 02:10:10,890
So, here I am,
their invisible god...

1462
02:10:12,935 --> 02:10:16,852
sneaking under their skin.

1463
02:10:16,896 --> 02:10:19,333
You know that history
isn't kind
to those who play God.

1464
02:10:19,376 --> 02:10:20,290
And you don't?

1465
02:10:22,466 --> 02:10:27,558
We both eradicate people
to make the world
a better place.

1466
02:10:27,602 --> 02:10:32,476
I just want to be
a little... tidier.

1467
02:10:32,520 --> 02:10:35,610
Without collateral.

1468
02:10:35,653 --> 02:10:38,091
I want the world to evolve,

1469
02:10:38,134 --> 02:10:39,875
yet you want it
to stay the same.

1470
02:10:41,311 --> 02:10:42,095
Let's face it...

1471
02:10:45,968 --> 02:10:49,537
-I've made you redundant.
- No.

1472
02:10:49,580 --> 02:10:51,408
Not as long
as there are people
like you in the world.

1473
02:10:53,584 --> 02:10:56,936
And with all due respect
to the enormity of your...

1474
02:10:58,067 --> 02:10:59,242
tidy achievements,

1475
02:11:00,940 --> 02:11:03,464
all you're really doing is
standing in a very long line

1476
02:11:03,507 --> 02:11:05,727
of angry little men.

1477
02:11:05,770 --> 02:11:09,513
I'm not angry,
just passionate.

1478
02:11:11,385 --> 02:11:14,301
Disable your explosives,
get off my island,

1479
02:11:14,344 --> 02:11:17,652
and you can take this precious
little angel with you.

1480
02:11:19,567 --> 02:11:20,133
And Madeleine?

1481
02:11:22,526 --> 02:11:24,920
-She stays.
-You know I can't do that.

1482
02:11:26,139 --> 02:11:27,792
That is a shame.

1483
02:11:29,533 --> 02:11:31,057
She really hoped you would.

1484
02:11:32,188 --> 02:11:34,364
She knows
it's her only path to survive.

1485
02:11:34,408 --> 02:11:37,411
No, you have her tell me that.

1486
02:11:37,454 --> 02:11:41,154
What mother wouldn't sacrifice
herself for her own child?

1487
02:11:43,983 --> 02:11:45,071
Is that what happened to yours?

1488
02:11:51,468 --> 02:11:53,949
My mother lay at my feet
as I watched her die.

1489
02:11:57,997 --> 02:11:59,128
Wait! Wait. Wait.

1490
02:12:03,828 --> 02:12:04,960
I'll do whatever you want.

1491
02:12:05,004 --> 02:12:06,005
Yes, you will.

1492
02:12:09,573 --> 02:12:11,097
I... I apologize.

1493
02:12:14,404 --> 02:12:15,753
I'm sorry.

1494
02:12:16,711 --> 02:12:18,495
Simple choices, Mr. Bond.

1495
02:12:20,280 --> 02:12:22,064
Like do you want to die
in front of your daughter?

1496
02:12:24,545 --> 02:12:26,199
Or do you want your daughter
to die in front of you?

1497
02:12:26,242 --> 02:12:28,027
No. No. No. No. No.

1498
02:12:30,594 --> 02:12:31,944
I am sorry.

1499
02:12:33,858 --> 02:12:35,121
I'm sorry.

1500
02:12:37,123 --> 02:12:38,385
Look at your father, Mathilde.

1501
02:12:42,476 --> 02:12:43,564
This is power.

1502
02:12:43,607 --> 02:12:44,652
I'm sorry.

1503
02:12:45,696 --> 02:12:48,221
I'm truly, truly sorry.

1504
02:12:58,274 --> 02:12:59,188
James!

1505
02:13:00,842 --> 02:13:02,539
-Where is she?
-

1506
02:13:06,239 --> 02:13:07,501
The first shipment
is on the dock,

1507
02:13:07,544 --> 02:13:09,155
-ready for pickup, Doctor.
- Very good.

1508
02:13:28,261 --> 02:13:30,002
Hmm...

1509
02:13:32,265 --> 02:13:34,180
If you don't want
my protection, then...

1510
02:13:35,790 --> 02:13:37,009
off you go.

1511
02:13:47,497 --> 02:13:50,022
Move.
Our first buyers are arriving.

1512
02:14:03,557 --> 02:14:06,864
Sir, I've just detected
some suspicious activity.

1513
02:14:06,908 --> 02:14:09,476
Several high-speed transports
are headed towards the island.

1514
02:14:09,519 --> 02:14:10,825
Origin unknown.

1515
02:14:10,868 --> 02:14:11,695
Still no sign of 007.

1516
02:14:14,307 --> 02:14:17,353
Come on, Bond.
Where the hell are you?

1517
02:14:17,397 --> 02:14:20,791
This is hopeless situation,
lady. Please.

1518
02:14:23,316 --> 02:14:24,839
Bond.

1519
02:14:24,882 --> 02:14:27,885
-Bond.

1520
02:14:27,929 --> 02:14:30,279
The party is larger
than the reservation.

1521
02:14:30,323 --> 02:14:33,369
Look, lady,
please, please just let me go.

1522
02:14:33,413 --> 02:14:36,111
I... There was never
gonna be a way out.

1523
02:14:37,591 --> 02:14:38,679
Stop this nonsense.

1524
02:14:38,722 --> 02:14:40,811
You don't have a chance,
anyways.

1525
02:14:42,639 --> 02:14:46,121
Hey. Hey, I have a good vial
for your people,

1526
02:14:46,165 --> 02:14:47,992
good for West African diaspora.
It can be a good thing.

1527
02:15:05,009 --> 02:15:07,708
You know,
I do not need laboratory

1528
02:15:07,751 --> 02:15:10,145
to exterminate your entire race
from the face of the Earth.

1529
02:15:12,365 --> 02:15:14,410
-Do you know what time it is?
-What?

1530
02:15:14,454 --> 02:15:16,151
Time to die.

1531
02:15:16,195 --> 02:15:18,545
No!

1532
02:15:28,381 --> 02:15:29,773
Move! Move!

1533
02:15:34,648 --> 02:15:36,084
They dropped down
to a lower level.

1534
02:15:36,128 --> 02:15:37,781
There has to be
a stairwell down.

1535
02:15:37,825 --> 02:15:38,521
Mama?

1536
02:15:47,835 --> 02:15:49,315
Mathilde. Mathilde.

1537
02:16:04,373 --> 02:16:05,592
We should go.

1538
02:16:07,507 --> 02:16:09,161
It's Q. Do you read me?

1539
02:16:10,814 --> 02:16:11,989
Come in, 007, it's Q.

1540
02:16:17,517 --> 02:16:19,649
Traffic. We have traffic.

1541
02:16:19,693 --> 02:16:22,304
-I think we just got buzzed.
-Those are two Russian MiGs.

1542
02:16:22,348 --> 02:16:24,045
Traffic. TCAS,
you have control.

1543
02:16:24,088 --> 02:16:25,612
I understand, and I'm doing
the best that I can.

1544
02:16:25,655 --> 02:16:27,788
Just please wait.

1545
02:16:27,831 --> 02:16:30,007
Sir, I've got the Navy,

1546
02:16:30,051 --> 02:16:31,879
the Japanese, the Russians,
all breathing down my neck,

1547
02:16:31,922 --> 02:16:34,142
demanding to know why
we've got a C-17

1548
02:16:34,186 --> 02:16:35,317
circling a disputed island.

1549
02:16:39,365 --> 02:16:40,409
Don't tell them
anything just yet.

1550
02:16:43,369 --> 02:16:46,763
-

1551
02:16:59,776 --> 02:17:02,301
Ah, just in time.
- Nomi, you know...

1552
02:17:03,476 --> 02:17:06,000
Madeleine, Mathilde,
they're my, uh...

1553
02:17:06,043 --> 02:17:07,262
-Hey.
-Hi.

1554
02:17:07,306 --> 02:17:08,263
Family?

1555
02:17:10,787 --> 02:17:12,659
Q. Q, are you there?

1556
02:17:12,702 --> 02:17:14,182
Yes. Bond.

1557
02:17:14,226 --> 02:17:17,533
Do we have
any Royal Naval vessels

1558
02:17:17,577 --> 02:17:20,971
-in the immediate vicinity?
-Uh, yes. Why?

1559
02:17:21,015 --> 02:17:22,843
We are gonna need
an immediate strike
on this location.

1560
02:17:22,886 --> 02:17:24,932
This whole island,

1561
02:17:24,975 --> 02:17:27,674
it's a manufacturing plant
for Heracles.

1562
02:17:27,717 --> 02:17:29,719
We don't have clearance
for missile strikes, do we?

1563
02:17:29,763 --> 02:17:31,678
Mm-mm.

1564
02:17:31,721 --> 02:17:33,854
Bond, there's something
else you should know.

1565
02:17:33,897 --> 02:17:37,118
Several unidentified ships
are headed your way.

1566
02:17:37,161 --> 02:17:39,425
They're coming after Heracles.
How far out?

1567
02:17:39,468 --> 02:17:40,513
Uh, 20 minutes.

1568
02:17:42,079 --> 02:17:43,255
Q, patch me through.

1569
02:17:44,778 --> 02:17:46,997
007.
-M.

1570
02:17:47,041 --> 02:17:50,523
Our operation
is attracting a lot
of international attention.

1571
02:17:50,566 --> 02:17:51,872
We're seeing what we can do.

1572
02:17:51,915 --> 02:17:52,525
Come on.

1573
02:17:54,266 --> 02:17:55,397
Let's go. Come on.

1574
02:18:02,926 --> 02:18:05,755
It's going to get
very cold out there, so...

1575
02:18:07,061 --> 02:18:08,758
I want you to have this.

1576
02:18:11,065 --> 02:18:12,066
That'll keep you warm.

1577
02:18:17,506 --> 02:18:19,943
I have to finish this. For us.

1578
02:18:21,118 --> 02:18:22,337
I know.

1579
02:18:32,565 --> 02:18:33,479
I'll just be a minute.

1580
02:18:41,008 --> 02:18:41,704
I've got them.

1581
02:18:43,532 --> 02:18:44,490
This might come in handy.

1582
02:18:45,839 --> 02:18:47,493
Thank you.

1583
02:19:10,037 --> 02:19:12,039
Q, talk to me.

1584
02:19:12,082 --> 02:19:15,608
Um, our uninvited guests
are 15 minutes away.

1585
02:19:15,651 --> 02:19:19,960
Bond, M here. The situation
is diplomatically complex.

1586
02:19:20,003 --> 02:19:23,093
We don't have a choice.
Fire on my mark.

1587
02:19:23,137 --> 02:19:25,574
If we launch,
the Russians, the Japanese

1588
02:19:25,618 --> 02:19:27,533
and even the Americans
will want answers.

1589
02:19:27,576 --> 02:19:28,621
Well, don't give them any.

1590
02:19:31,928 --> 02:19:34,191
Rational minds, Bond.

1591
02:19:34,235 --> 02:19:35,932
I'm trying to save this from
escalating to all-out war.

1592
02:19:37,804 --> 02:19:40,633
Mallory, if we don't do this,

1593
02:19:40,676 --> 02:19:41,808
there will be nothing
left to save.

1594
02:19:43,853 --> 02:19:46,421
Fire on my mark.

1595
02:19:46,465 --> 02:19:47,944
007,
there's another problem.

1596
02:19:47,988 --> 02:19:49,903
-That room you were just in.
-Yes, I know, I know.

1597
02:19:49,946 --> 02:19:51,600
I've got
to open the blast doors.

1598
02:19:51,644 --> 02:19:53,167
Otherwise our missiles
will bounce off it

1599
02:19:53,210 --> 02:19:55,169
like they've hit a trampoline.

1600
02:19:55,212 --> 02:19:56,431
Yes, I know, I know.

1601
02:19:58,302 --> 02:20:00,392
Find the control room.
It should be in a tower

1602
02:20:00,435 --> 02:20:02,437
just above the blast doors.

1603
02:20:02,481 --> 02:20:05,135
The missiles will take about
nine minutes from launch.

1604
02:20:05,179 --> 02:20:06,789
Do you think you can do it
before the ships arrive?

1605
02:20:06,833 --> 02:20:08,617
Plenty of time,
plenty of time.

1606
02:23:17,240 --> 02:23:20,287
-

1607
02:23:25,466 --> 02:23:27,773
Bond.
Bond, do you read me?

1608
02:23:31,864 --> 02:23:33,082
Yeah, Q.

1609
02:23:33,126 --> 02:23:34,301
I read you.

1610
02:23:34,344 --> 02:23:36,085
Sounds like
you're in a rugby scrum.

1611
02:23:36,129 --> 02:23:37,609
I just showed someone
your watch.

1612
02:23:39,306 --> 02:23:40,786
Really blew their mind.

1613
02:23:42,962 --> 02:23:45,878
Right, good.
Now, did you find
the control room?

1614
02:23:48,271 --> 02:23:50,796
Well, my Russian
is a little rusty,
but I think so, yeah.

1615
02:24:04,548 --> 02:24:06,333
Okay, Q.

1616
02:24:06,376 --> 02:24:08,248
Uh,
I've done some research.

1617
02:24:08,291 --> 02:24:10,685
Old schematics...
-Q, I am gonna need some...

1618
02:24:10,729 --> 02:24:11,643
Yes?

1619
02:24:12,992 --> 02:24:14,210
Bond?

1620
02:24:17,387 --> 02:24:19,433
-Hello?
-Power.

1621
02:24:19,476 --> 02:24:21,348
-Power?
-

1622
02:24:21,391 --> 02:24:23,176
Right, the infrastructure
must go back to the 1950s,

1623
02:24:23,219 --> 02:24:24,612
so it's going to be
an overly complicated

1624
02:24:24,656 --> 02:24:26,658
and intricate
switching system.

1625
02:24:26,701 --> 02:24:29,704
Now, the order
in which you engage it

1626
02:24:29,748 --> 02:24:31,140
will need to be
extremely precise.

1627
02:24:31,184 --> 02:24:34,187
You're looking
for a control panel.

1628
02:24:34,230 --> 02:24:37,451
There should be
a counterweight clutch.

1629
02:24:37,494 --> 02:24:39,148
So, listen very carefully, 007.

1630
02:24:39,192 --> 02:24:40,410
The first thing
you need to do...

1631
02:24:40,454 --> 02:24:41,847
Got it.

1632
02:24:43,152 --> 02:24:43,805
I think.

1633
02:24:58,472 --> 02:24:59,995
Yep, that's it.
Launch the missiles.

1634
02:25:00,039 --> 02:25:01,736
Not until you're clear.

1635
02:25:01,780 --> 02:25:03,346
Q, tell M
to launch the missiles now.

1636
02:25:04,739 --> 02:25:08,177
Okay. Okay, okay.
Understood.

1637
02:25:08,221 --> 02:25:09,918
M, Bond says fire.

1638
02:25:11,746 --> 02:25:13,356
HMS Dragon here.

1639
02:25:13,400 --> 02:25:14,880
-Admiral.
-Sir.

1640
02:25:16,708 --> 02:25:19,711
-M here.
-What are my instructions?

1641
02:25:19,754 --> 02:25:21,756
You have permission to launch.

1642
02:25:21,800 --> 02:25:23,366
Roger. Launching the strike.

1643
02:25:37,729 --> 02:25:40,296
Missiles airborne.
Nine minutes out.

1644
02:26:09,021 --> 02:26:10,762
No.

1645
02:26:12,372 --> 02:26:13,765
No. No, no!

1646
02:26:46,710 --> 02:26:50,410
Quite a mess you've made.
Like an animal.

1647
02:26:50,453 --> 02:26:52,412
-

1648
02:26:55,894 --> 02:26:57,809
-

1649
02:27:19,178 --> 02:27:24,661
Now we are both poisoned
with heartbreak.

1650
02:27:27,186 --> 02:27:29,841
Two heroes in a tragedy
of our own making.

1651
02:27:37,544 --> 02:27:41,026
Anyone we touch,
we are their curse.

1652
02:27:42,157 --> 02:27:44,159
A stroke to their cheek,

1653
02:27:44,203 --> 02:27:45,857
a kiss...

1654
02:27:47,771 --> 02:27:49,948
would kill them instantly.

1655
02:27:54,561 --> 02:27:55,649
Yes...

1656
02:27:57,129 --> 02:27:57,999
Madeleine.

1657
02:28:00,959 --> 02:28:04,658
Yes, Mathilde.

1658
02:28:20,892 --> 02:28:23,459
You made me do this,
you see?

1659
02:28:28,943 --> 02:28:30,684
This was your choice.

1660
02:29:18,645 --> 02:29:20,690
Q. Q, are you there?

1661
02:29:20,734 --> 02:29:21,735
Bond, there you are.

1662
02:29:21,778 --> 02:29:22,997
Are they safe, Q?

1663
02:29:23,041 --> 02:29:25,782
Yes, they're safe.

1664
02:29:25,826 --> 02:29:28,263
Bond,
have you left the island?

1665
02:29:28,307 --> 02:29:30,091
There's a slight problem
with the blast doors.

1666
02:29:31,571 --> 02:29:32,398
Won't take a sec.

1667
02:29:34,530 --> 02:29:37,751
No, no, no. Bond, the missiles
have already launched.

1668
02:29:37,794 --> 02:29:39,231
Just get out of there.

1669
02:29:50,285 --> 02:29:52,200
Q, how do I, uh...

1670
02:29:53,071 --> 02:29:55,160
How do I destroy this?

1671
02:29:56,291 --> 02:29:57,989
If the silo doors are open,

1672
02:29:58,032 --> 02:29:59,381
the missiles
will deal with it.

1673
02:29:59,425 --> 02:30:01,905
No. No, no, no.
If you get it on you,
how do...

1674
02:30:03,255 --> 02:30:05,126
How do you get it off?

1675
02:30:05,170 --> 02:30:06,519
You know as well as I do
that you can't.

1676
02:30:06,562 --> 02:30:08,173
It's... It's permanent.

1677
02:30:08,216 --> 02:30:11,437
It's eternal. Which is why
we have to destroy it.

1678
02:30:11,480 --> 02:30:15,093
For Christ's sake, James,
just get off the island.

1679
02:30:15,136 --> 02:30:17,008
It's harmless unless
you're near to the target.

1680
02:30:19,140 --> 02:30:22,143
Yeah.
Well, that's not gonna work.

1681
02:30:28,715 --> 02:30:30,021
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1682
02:30:32,762 --> 02:30:33,285
It's for Madeleine.

1683
02:30:37,680 --> 02:30:39,117
It's all right, Q.

1684
02:30:40,596 --> 02:30:42,511
It's all all right.

1685
02:30:44,078 --> 02:30:45,906
Would you put
Madeleine on, please?

1686
02:30:45,949 --> 02:30:47,125
Yes, of course.
How stupid of me.

1687
02:30:53,044 --> 02:30:54,958
Nomi, come in.
Can you put Madeleine on?

1688
02:30:56,786 --> 02:30:57,744
Madeleine.

1689
02:31:05,404 --> 02:31:07,449
-James.
-Madeleine.

1690
02:31:07,493 --> 02:31:08,755
I'm here.

1691
02:31:09,756 --> 02:31:10,626
Where are you?

1692
02:31:12,498 --> 02:31:13,499
Is it done?

1693
02:31:14,630 --> 02:31:15,762
-James?
-Yes.

1694
02:31:15,805 --> 02:31:17,372
Yes, he's... He's dead.

1695
02:31:17,416 --> 02:31:19,331
-Are you both there?
-Yes.

1696
02:31:21,376 --> 02:31:23,857
Good. You're safe.
That's good.

1697
02:31:24,858 --> 02:31:26,381
Have you left?

1698
02:31:29,776 --> 02:31:31,169
No. Um...

1699
02:31:32,779 --> 02:31:33,519
I'm not gonna make it.

1700
02:31:36,391 --> 02:31:37,218
What?

1701
02:31:40,439 --> 02:31:42,658
-Madeleine. Madeleine.
-You promised.

1702
02:31:44,095 --> 02:31:45,270
Just get off that island.

1703
02:31:47,968 --> 02:31:49,012
I know you can do this.

1704
02:31:52,146 --> 02:31:53,756
Everything's good now.

1705
02:31:57,020 --> 02:31:58,892
There's no one left
to hurt us.

1706
02:31:58,935 --> 02:32:00,023
Madeleine...

1707
02:32:03,592 --> 02:32:05,333
you have made...

1708
02:32:06,813 --> 02:32:10,947
the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.

1709
02:32:13,167 --> 02:32:14,516
She's perfect.

1710
02:32:18,868 --> 02:32:20,131
Because she came from you.

1711
02:32:32,230 --> 02:32:34,145
Oh, God. The vial.

1712
02:32:39,150 --> 02:32:40,151
You've been poisoned.

1713
02:32:42,196 --> 02:32:43,154
Yes.

1714
02:32:44,416 --> 02:32:45,330
There must be a way.

1715
02:32:50,378 --> 02:32:51,162
There must be a way.

1716
02:33:03,870 --> 02:33:05,219
We just need more time.

1717
02:33:06,438 --> 02:33:07,874
If we only had more time.

1718
02:33:14,185 --> 02:33:15,969
You have all the time
in the world.

1719
02:33:19,886 --> 02:33:21,192
I love you.

1720
02:33:24,934 --> 02:33:25,674
I love you too.

1721
02:33:46,869 --> 02:33:48,436
She does have your eyes.

1722
02:33:52,571 --> 02:33:54,225
I know.

1723
02:34:07,760 --> 02:34:09,240
I know.

1724
02:35:13,826 --> 02:35:16,568
Very hard to know
what to say,

1725
02:35:16,611 --> 02:35:19,875
but I thought we should gather
and remember.

1726
02:35:21,224 --> 02:35:23,052
And I...

1727
02:35:23,096 --> 02:35:27,361
I thought
this was appropriate.

1728
02:35:31,887 --> 02:35:36,022
"The function of man
is to live, not to exist.

1729
02:35:39,460 --> 02:35:41,984
I shall not waste my days
trying to prolong them.

1730
02:35:43,638 --> 02:35:45,510
I shall use my time."

1731
02:35:58,436 --> 02:35:59,567
To James.

1732
02:36:00,873 --> 02:36:02,091
-James.
-James.

1733
02:36:02,135 --> 02:36:03,571
James.

1734
02:36:05,399 --> 02:36:07,009
James.

1735
02:36:15,278 --> 02:36:17,585
Right, back to work.

1736
02:36:34,776 --> 02:36:36,865
Mathilde.

1737
02:36:38,127 --> 02:36:39,564
I'm going to tell you
a story...

1738
02:36:41,870 --> 02:36:44,046
about a man.

1739
02:36:44,090 --> 02:36:45,613
His name was Bond.

1740
02:36:47,485 --> 02:36:48,486
James Bond.
