00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:15,557
I'm Catherine and I dance very beautiful!

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,350
- <i>Hey, Catherine.</i>

5
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:20,520
No pictures. No pictures. No pictures.

6
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:25,358
Well, I'm just gonna walk into the TV.

7
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:27,193
- You are?
- Yeah.

8
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,571
- That's magic.
- I know.

9
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,797
I feel completely insane,
but I look literally stunning.

10
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:51,176
- That's five.
- Yes. Thank you, Knock.

11
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,511
Thank you, Five.

12
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,013
Thank you…

13
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,398
<i>Hello, New York City.</i>

14
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,275
<i>Welcome to Joe's Pub.</i>

15
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:12,655
<i>Please give a thunderous,</i>
<i>warm welcome to Catherine Cohen.</i>

16
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,052
Seriously.

17
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,388
Stop. I'm shy.

18
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,732
Oh, my God.

19
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,150
I have an amazing voice.

20
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,027
- Wow.

21
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,614
Look at me
doing comedy in a rhinestone romper.

22
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,575
Against all odds.

23
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,453
Bet you're wondering how I got here.

24
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,748
Well, baby, I'll tell you.

25
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,348
Hey!

26
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,740
Whoo!

27
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,740
"Gimme my hat back."

28
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:33,838
I don't have one.

29
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,887
I don't have a car. Lunge out.

30
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,101
Seriously, please.

31
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,396
White boot.

32
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:53,858
Hit my clit.

33
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,407
Yeah. Bridge.

34
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,299
Help! Spin. Okay.

35
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,139
- Give it up.

36
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:31,521
Seriously, please.

37
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:34,816
Hair flip.

38
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,695
I'm unwell.

39
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,910
Big finish. Ready? Hey.

40
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,093
Give it up for Henry Koperski on the keys.

41
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,973
So, welcome to heaven.
This my show.

42
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:10,852
You look at me,
you think, "Okay. She has it all."

43
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,103
And it's true.

44
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,565
I do. Ooh.

45
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,650
I'm young. Oh.

46
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,944
I'm gorgeous. Ooh.

47
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,613
But, just this morning,
I had one sip of cold brew

48
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,407
and ruined my only butthole.

49
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,785
Stars, they're just like us.

50
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:32,332
I am so happy to be
doing this in New York City.

51
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,543
Mmm!

52
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,630
New York City, where I,
for lack of a better term,

53
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,674
do actually "live."

54
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,594
The other day,
I was dry-swallowing my birth control pill

55
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,554
as I Citi Biked up the Williamsburg Bridge

56
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:51,100
and I was like, "Oh, my God.
I guess I am the voice of my generation."

57
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,937
And it's exhausting,
but someone has to do it.

58
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,023
I'm sorry…

59
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:02,320
Oh, I'm sorry.
I literally can't stop creating content.

60
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:06,199
If this gets too tall,
I will try to fuck it.

61
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,241
So we have to…

62
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,452
She has a type.

63
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:15,666
I recently quit my job
because I couldn't wake up and go there.

64
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,669
Does that resonate with anyone?

65
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:19,962
Yeah.

66
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,632
So, now I've been doing
a lot of lying on my bed,

67
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,175
just kind of waiting for the retweet,

68
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,718
that'll
turn it all around.

69
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,763
Social media is perfect,

70
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,765
'cause you can watch
people you barely know

71
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:33,184
sort of unravel in real time.

72
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,436
Which I absolutely foot pop <i>j'adore.</i>

73
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,355
No, jealousy is cool,

74
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:40,525
'cause it's like swallowing
a house that you just set on fire.

75
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:48,407
Not to be this bitch,
but a pandemic, colon?

76
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,867
Not what I had in mind.

77
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:55,248
So ran… Literally, so random.

78
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,669
I was like,
"I did not know this was an option."

79
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:03,881
I was way more concerned with things
just falling on my head.

80
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,425
There's a lot of stuff that's up.

81
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,137
And here I am beneath.

82
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,974
But a pandemic is what we ultimately got.

83
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,851
Which was rock and roll, normal and cool.

84
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,311
The last year was absolutely exquisite.

85
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,149
I gained a lot of weight
over the last year,

86
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,358
which isn't good or bad.

87
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,528
It isn't good or bad. Not…
It isn't good or bad.

88
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:31,075
So, it isn't good or bad to gain weight
because isn't good or <i>bad.</i>

89
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,661
And can you tell
I had therapy two times this week?

90
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:34,704
Yes.

91
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,832
Oh, my God.
A standing ovation so early in the show.

92
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,334
I did not see that coming.

93
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,794
Um, but it's cool.

94
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:45,089
One perk of gaining weight
is that, obviously, my tits got huge.

95
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,800
If you didn't notice,
it's because you hate women.

96
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,180
My tits got big enough that I can now,

97
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,475
like all the great poets
who came before me,

98
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,226
titty fuck my boyfriend.

99
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,813
Thank you. Thank you.

100
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,650
No, no. And that's not why I do it.

101
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:09,197
I don't like being the girl who's like,
"My boyfriend, my boyfriend,"

102
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,116
I feel like girls who are like,
"My boyfriend, my boyfriend,"

103
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,868
are the same kind of girls who are like,

104
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:16,621
"There is actually
too much sugar in fruit."

105
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:22,376
"So, for me, it's a dessert."

106
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,880
And then their mouth goes
all the way around their face.

107
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,718
But I can officially titty fuck my…

108
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:34,013
Don't you sometimes wish
there were different words for things?

109
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,765
But now my tits are big enough

110
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,184
that I can wrap 'em
'round my boyfriend's cock.

111
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,187
Did you think…

112
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,440
Be honest. Did you think you'd hear
"cock" this early in the show?

113
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,652
Cock is such a porny word.

114
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,445
I famously love porn,

115
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,656
if my boyfriend tells me
the girl looks like me.

116
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,950
Otherwise, it is bad for women.

117
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:57,161
And that's just
where I stand on that issue.

118
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:02,625
So, I was, for the last time,
titty fucking my boyfriend.

119
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,670
Humble brag. And…

120
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,424
when he came…

121
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,384
Yeah.

122
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:14,887
Could hear a freaking pin drop.

123
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,015
When he came,

124
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,727
he made a sound I've never heard before.

125
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:26,524
And I was like, "Okay.
I'm a sex goddess."

126
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,610
I turn to him, I say…

127
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,198
"How was that for you?"

128
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,994
And he goes,
"It was actually almost painful."

129
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,415
Um, feminist win much?

130
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,590
Yes. I'm doing the work.

131
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:56,262
Oh, there's such a good energy in here. I…

132
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,389
- You're family.

133
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:01,058
I love. I love.

134
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,518
What a summer.

135
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,686
It's been a time.

136
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,605
I hate the summer.

137
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,149
All I've ever done in a bikini is sob.

138
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,110
But one thing I love about summer,

139
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:16,824
I have to say,
is those hot, hot summer anthems.

140
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:21,954
So, if the DJ could just drop
that track real quick, that'd be sick.

141
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,374
I'm really more
of a dancer than a comedian.

142
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:30,296
Dancer first, choreographer second,
model third, comedian fourth.

143
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,257
Shh. Let me do my thing.

144
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:27,853
Yes!

145
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:06,642
Bridge.

146
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,319
Step ball change.

147
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:27,580
Yes!

148
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:49,351
Um, I think everyone has heard by now,
but I want to be up front about this.

149
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,228
I have some exciting news.

150
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,022
I…

151
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,150
recently read a book.

152
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,952
Thank you. Thank you.
I love you.

153
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,372
I have a rare disease
where if I read a book,

154
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,791
the whole time
I'm looking at it, I'm like,

155
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:18,923
"Look at you. Reading a book."

156
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,176
"You stupid, stupid slut."

157
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,930
Just 'cause I don't like to read,
write, argue or be alone,

158
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,890
doesn't mean I'm not an intellectual.

159
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,353
That's my crowd work.

160
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,233
I actually won
a very prestigious award lately.

161
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,359
Hold for applause.

162
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:44,198
I won an award for leaving my home
without my phone for 42 minutes.

163
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:45,866
Yeah. Thank you.

164
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,118
And, no, and that's not why I do it.

165
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,787
And that's not why I do it.

166
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:51,872
When I did that,

167
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:55,793
I had what critics and fans alike
are calling "a lady in a movie moment."

168
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,879
"What's that? What's that? What could
that possibly be? What is that?"

169
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:02,841
So, "a lady in a movie moment"
is when something happens to you

170
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,969
that might happen to a lady in a movie.

171
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,222
So, for example,

172
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:11,684
if you, um… if you check the mail
with your little key…

173
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,644
Lady in a movie.

174
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,733
If you hold a baguette…
If you're even near a baguette…

175
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,654
Lady in a movie.

176
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:28,200
And if you, say it with me,
run into your ex on the street,

177
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,536
that is full-blown, hundy p,

178
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,705
- lady in a…
- Lady in a movie.

179
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,248
Thank you.

180
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:35,416
Oh!

181
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,001
It feels good to be at home.

182
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,714
So, I did recently, like a cartoon,
have a lady in a movie moment.

183
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:44,174
I ran into my ex on the street.

184
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,261
And he was wearing a suit.

185
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,972
He looked incredible.
Which is, as we know, illegal.

186
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:52,016
And I was wearing…

187
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,768
What's it called when you, like,
don't shave your legs for three months

188
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:57,938
and then you shave 'em really quick
and there's blood everywhere?

189
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,232
So, I was wearing that.

190
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,236
And we ran into each other,
and he's one of these people

191
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,530
who uses your name in a sentence.

192
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:07,865
It's like… Whoa.

193
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:12,536
If you use my name in a sentence,
you need to either fuck me or kill me.

194
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,122
There's no in-between.

195
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:17,333
On this occasion,
he kind of chose to do neither,

196
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,168
which was, of course, a power move

197
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,504
and not at all related
to how he feels about me.

198
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,215
I'm sorry. I just choked
on my own human tongue.

199
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,011
Breakups are cool. Right?

200
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,054
I'm a guy's girl.

201
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,681
Breakups are cool.

202
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,435
Breakups are freaking sick.

203
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:38,938
Breakups are cool

204
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,941
because it's like you have
a best friend and then they die.

205
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,572
And then,
instead of going to their funeral,

206
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:51,033
you go and fuck
a long-haired guy named Randy

207
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:54,161
in the back seat of a red Mazda
in the parking lot of a water park.

208
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,829
And when you ask him to drive you home,

209
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,581
he goes, "I can't. I'm on shrooms."

210
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,292
What stage of grief is that?

211
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,127
Which one? No. Okay, that's good.

212
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,796
Get back to me on that. I…

213
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,590
I learned a lot from my ex, though.
It's cool.

214
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:11,095
I never thought, and I'm sorry,
I get choked up when I talk about this.

215
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,972
But, I, um…

216
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,473
Here I go again. He knows.

217
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:20,771
I never thought
that I could love someone

218
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:24,733
who can watch an entire movie
while sitting upright in a wooden chair.

219
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,949
But love works in mysterious ways.

220
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,284
I mean, she really, really does.

221
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,454
My ex and I
lived together for three years.

222
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,624
And we actually kept living together
two months after we broke up.

223
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,794
Which is, of course, say it with me,
good for the environment.

224
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:46,088
Oops, I just ran for office.

225
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,131
Oops, I just won.

226
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:52,261
Thankfully… Imagine.

227
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:55,889
No, thank you.

228
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:58,809
Um…

229
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:04,148
Whenever… Whenever I think… I'm like,
"Who decides where the streets go?"

230
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,359
I think about that a lot.

231
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,320
And all I think is,
"I am so glad that's not my job."

232
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,534
So, thankfully, I live by myself now.

233
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,411
When I first moved into my own apartment,

234
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:21,248
I fully developed a,
say it with me, new personality.

235
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,667
I have a lot of new traits now.

236
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:26,670
I recently went
to a Chipotle at 10:45 a.m.

237
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:27,755
Doctor's orders.

238
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,009
And when I walked in, I was like…

239
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,054
'Cause I'm cool.
When I walk into Chipotle…

240
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,431
Up here, I'm all… At Chipotle, I get it.

241
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:38,432
I'm like…

242
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,815
I walk into a Chipotle
and the guy working there…

243
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,901
Yes, a man. Important for the story.

244
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:50,861
He's like, "What do you want?"

245
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:54,656
And I'm like, "Okay.
He wants to have raw dog sex with me."

246
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:02,664
No. I say, "Hello.
I would like a chicken burrito bowl."

247
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,501
"I know guac is extra
and I'll take the hottest sauce."

248
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:10,255
He goes, "You sure?"

249
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,471
I was like, "Oh, my God."

250
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,432
"Am I sure?"

251
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,144
Mmm…

252
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,272
"I don't know."

253
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,359
"I never thought about that before."

254
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,657
"I don't think about
big boy questions like that."

255
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,869
"I'm just a little girly."

256
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:44,039
"I think about
little girly things like earrings."

257
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:47,626
"And shoes. I don't know
about big boy stuff like that."

258
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,878
"I'm just a little baby with titties."

259
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,550
Oh, I'm sorry.
I just completely blacked out.

260
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,676
Did I do something?

261
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,179
Wait, did I say something annoying?

262
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,309
I don't think we should kill all the men.

263
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,227
Hold for applause.

264
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,772
But I don't think men
should be allowed to make movies.

265
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:15,946
Superhero movies are so boring
I could melt into the Earth.

266
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,658
I don't care about movies
that are about, like,

267
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:21,577
sand…

268
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,790
or rope,

269
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,750
or space.

270
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:33,130
The only kind of movies I want to watch
are where a woman looks at herself

271
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:36,508
in her medicine cabinet mirror and says…

272
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,219
"Hello, stranger."

273
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,932
That's kind of the genre
that works for me.

274
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,520
That being said, I do wanna be
the first person in a Marvel movie

275
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,230
who's never seen a Marvel movie.

276
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,983
So, DM me.

277
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:55,736
You know, it's sad.

278
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:59,198
I do have a hard time
with men, but even I…

279
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:02,701
Even I can't resist.

280
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,245
Even I get a bit horny this…

281
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:07,873
…time of year.

282
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,274
Brr.

283
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:21,548
Good night.

284
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,759
- Ooh.

285
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:30,390
Okay. I feel so randomly safe
with y'all. So comfortable.

286
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,767
Family, family, family.

287
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,269
I can reveal now,
at this point in the program…

288
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:39,775
In high school, my nickname was Critter.

289
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,277
I think 'cause
I'm conventionally attractive and…

290
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,741
I didn't love it because Critter
was shortened to "Crit."

291
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,284
To me, that sounded a lot like "Clit."

292
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:52,079
And I was like, "What's happening
with my one life?" But…

293
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,624
Honestly, now, like,

294
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,709
I am a lot like a clit.

295
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:00,962
I'm extremely sensitive,

296
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,964
I love to be touched,

297
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:06,510
and straight guys just don't know
what to do with me.

298
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,346
Sometimes they want to fuck me,

299
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,848
and sometimes they think
I'm like a fun aunt

300
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,225
'cause my energy is like…

301
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:17,479
And I'm always at restaurants
moaning along

302
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:20,816
when the waiter tells me the specials.
I'm always like, "Mmm, risotto."

303
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:26,029
Mmm. 'Cause it's always
a mushroom risotto. Fuck yes!

304
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,448
- Whoo!
- Wow!

305
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:32,369
That mushroom risotto joke
is an absolute banger.

306
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:33,954
Um…

307
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:36,164
Thank you so much. Have a great night. No.

308
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:39,167
You wish. You sick fucks.

309
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,878
But I got more to give.

310
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:46,216
I actually was supposed to go to
my ten-year high school reunion recently.

311
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:47,884
But I couldn't go because I was, um,

312
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,804
jerking off on the floor of my apartment.

313
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:52,514
"Why the floor? Why the floor?
Why the floor?"

314
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:55,684
I was too lazy to close the window curtain
that looks into the bed.

315
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,310
So, I was like, "Floor it is."

316
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,771
And I think everyone here knows,

317
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,566
but I do actually have
a mirrored armoire in my bedroom.

318
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,192
If you don't know what an armoire is,

319
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,611
now would be an awesome time
to leave the show.

320
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,030
Thank you.

321
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,449
Bye.

322
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:14,369
So I'm jerking off on the floor.

323
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:16,538
And the way I do it is
beached-whale style,

324
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:19,499
which means I just lay on my hand
and away.

325
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,503
And when I looked up
into my mirrored armoire,

326
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:26,173
I saw something I really
wouldn't wish on anyone.

327
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,217
I saw…

328
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:35,307
in its organic, hardy,
grass-fed, natural state…

329
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,559
my O face.

330
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:42,689
Without the performance of sex,
the pressure of another,

331
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:46,568
I saw what I looked like
when I cum, which is…

332
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:02,792
So, when I cum,
this is actually my O face.

333
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,257
I don't want to be like this.

334
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:14,054
By the way, if my face was symmetrical,
I would not be up here doing this shit.

335
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,765
Goes without saying,
I don't want to be this way.

336
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,351
I want to be the kind of girl
who just wears jeans.

337
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:24,022
I wish I could do…
You know when people do that?

338
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:26,107
I can't jump even a little.

339
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:29,152
This is literally me
jumping as high as I can.

340
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:35,200
I wish I could be
the kind of girl who's like…

341
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:37,369
Sometimes people's legs go up.

342
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:41,623
I want to be the kind of girl
who just doesn't like the taste of beer.

343
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,793
The kind of girl who can save
half a sandwich for later.

344
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,964
The kind of girl
who can go into a coffee shop

345
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,258
and just stare at sheet music.

346
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:57,264
Just clutch it
and stare at it and be like,

347
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,099
"I get this."

348
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:05,563
I want to be the kind of woman
who's out to lunch with friends,

349
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:08,108
she's draped in silks,
draped in silks, draped in silks.

350
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:12,070
The restaurant, of course,
white tablecloth, white tablecloth.

351
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:15,991
And she starts to laugh because
she remembers something funny,

352
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,575
a memory maybe.

353
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:21,830
But before she does, she stops herself.

354
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:23,456
She says…

355
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,128
"I was in love once."

356
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,048
So that's the kind of girl I want to be.

357
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:36,303
- But I have career goals too.
- Whoo!

358
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:37,929
Girl boss.

359
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,223
Um, I really, really… And this is serious.

360
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:43,518
This is off the record.
I really want to wear a bonnet on screen.

361
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,854
Does anyone have one?

362
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,107
I have such a face for hats.

363
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:52,110
I have the world's roundest face.
Thank you.

364
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:53,820
No. Don't all stand up at once.

365
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,989
I really want to wear a bonnet
on screen. Um…

366
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:58,658
And then my second career goal is
I want to be in a film

367
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:00,660
where I'm going on a first date,

368
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:03,204
and as I'm kissing my suitor goodnight,

369
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,582
I close the door shut to my apartment,

370
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,917
and then I turn around and I just…

371
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:15,133
Yes. I slide against that door.

372
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:20,430
I hooked up with a guy I met
on a first date once 'cause I'm a slut.

373
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:21,681
Take back the word.

374
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:27,520
And mid-moment, he was like,
"Oh, yeah. I love that fat, fat ass."

375
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:28,730
And I was like…

376
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,193
"Maybe one fat was enough."

377
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:38,907
I do. I do. I… I know.

378
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,868
I gravely want to be thin
because of society.

379
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:49,000
Because thin privilege is real.

380
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:52,170
If you're thin…
This is my ideal body type.

381
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:58,218
If you're thin, you can be famous
for smoking a cigarette and looking sad.

382
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:04,015
If you're fat and there's a photo of you
smoking a cigarette and looking sad,

383
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:06,184
it's a campaign for something.

384
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,479
It's some D.A.R.E. shit.
You know what I mean?

385
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,857
But mostly I want to be thin so I can wear

386
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,818
whatever clothes I want, whenever I want.

387
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:19,364
Because, as we all know,
women's clothing sizes are totally fucked.

388
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,074
And that's what this song's about.

389
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:15,855
Bridge!

390
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,212
Mosh pit me.

391
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,089
Mosh me.

392
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,091
Mosh me.

393
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:46,302
Mosh pit me.

394
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:21,588
They won't say that,
but they'll mean that.

395
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:22,922
You know what I mean?

396
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:41,357
I'll see a person. I'll say,
"Oh, my God. Is that person okay?"

397
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:42,775
"Is that person okay?"

398
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:45,987
"That person's so small."

399
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,865
My friend will turn to me and say,
"That's a kid. That's all."

400
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:51,784
"That's a kid. A lot of people have them."

401
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:54,287
And if you thought about something
other than yourself

402
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,536
Whenever I tell people
I want to lose weight,

403
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,581
they're like, "You should go to the gym."
I'm like, "I know."

404
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,167
For sure.

405
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:44,837
But whenever I go to the gym
and I see people with abs,

406
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,298
it's like, "Why are you still here?"

407
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:50,802
"You did it."

408
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:55,264
Like, "Get a hobby… for once."

409
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:57,809
I don't know.

410
00:32:57,892 --> 00:33:00,478
I just… I know working out
is good for mental health.

411
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:03,481
I do suffer from depression,
or as I like to call it,

412
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:06,985
"Crying because
outside smells like the past."

413
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:10,029
I love nostalgia. It hurts and feels bad.

414
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:10,947
Boop.

415
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,449
But when I go to the gym,

416
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,618
I just cannot connect with those people.

417
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:19,831
If you're someone who uses
and cleans a blender every day,

418
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:23,042
it's like, "What's really going on?"

419
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:25,878
What's going on?

420
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:29,173
If you're someone who signs up for, like,

421
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:32,510
"mud fuck run."

422
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,930
Or it's like, "We run for a month."

423
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:39,225
"And you never come home."
It's like, "What is that?"

424
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:41,436
I just worry about you.

425
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,232
And so… I'm gonna sing this song for you.

426
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,131
Oh.

427
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,591
At this point in the show,
I know you're thinking,

428
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:19,218
"Okay. So, she's beautiful and talented."

429
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,804
"There's no way that
there's anything up here."

430
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:26,142
But I'm actually
a brilliant poet and writer.

431
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:29,145
And so I'm gonna share some of my poetry.

432
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:32,398
Uh, could you give us a little mood music?
I think that would be good.

433
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:35,651
- Oh, my God. Wow.

434
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:37,862
Takes me back.

435
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:49,248
Sorry. I just thought of something,
but it's for a different show.

436
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:52,752
Hmm.

437
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:57,173
"A poem I wrote last night
when I couldn't go to sleep,

438
00:36:57,256 --> 00:37:01,260
because there are no sheets on my bed
because I perioded on my other sheets

439
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,596
and cannot be bothered
to put new ones on."

440
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:06,557
"I'm sorry I didn't text you back

441
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:10,853
about borrowing my adult sized tutu
for your sketch comedy show."

442
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:14,398
"I was on the L train trying to recall how
I knew the guy sitting across from me."

443
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:17,360
"Turns out it was from sex.
Thank you so much."

444
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:18,945
So this next poem…

445
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,031
This is called

446
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:26,202
"Poem I wrote after my therapist got mad
at me for thinking everyone's mad at me."

447
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:30,581
"I just found out 'dog'
isn't short for something."

448
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:33,501
"It's actually just called a dog,
which is fine with me."

449
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:37,046
"I'm in the kitchen, alone.
Which is romantic in a way."

450
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:39,548
"Anything can be romantic
if you sigh a lot."

451
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:42,969
"One time, I told this guy I loved him."
He said, "I don't know what love is."

452
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:45,388
"Anyway, he just got engaged." Thank you.

453
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:52,061
"Poem I wrote after I masturbated
while wearing AirPods."

454
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:54,480
It could happen to you, so be vigilant.

455
00:37:56,691 --> 00:38:00,236
"Sometimes, being an adult
means washing your hair."

456
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:03,656
"Sometimes, the only way to know
if a guy is definitely straight

457
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:05,616
is if he Instagrams a building."

458
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:12,081
"Sometimes I feel like if I look at
my phone, I will die or worse, not die."

459
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:14,709
"It's insane
when you ask someone to give you space

460
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:15,835
and then they do."

461
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,296
Thank you.

462
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:21,090
This next poem is called

463
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:24,677
"A poem I wrote after you told me
your ex is 'actually really cool.'"

464
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,931
"A guy on the street said I looked like

465
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:31,976
I was studying audio engineering
in school."

466
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:39,734
"He told me he liked my outfit.
He told me to have a 'cool day.'"

467
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:42,069
"I'm googling how long a stroke lasts."

468
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:46,824
Thank you.

469
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:50,244
"Poem I wrote after you went down on me
and then called me 'dude.'"

470
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:57,960
"I have a disease where I never
want to get out of the Uber."

471
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:00,212
"Because then it means
I have to be somewhere."

472
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:03,007
"For years I've been suffering
from a serious addiction

473
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,718
to Adam Driver
and Jason Schwartzman, even."

474
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:08,262
"Maybe my crush hasn't texted
because I'm out of town."

475
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,265
"But then again, I never told him
I was going out of town."

476
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:16,729
"I'm always horny and looking for
somewhere to charge my phone."

477
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:21,400
<i>"The Paris Review</i> came in the mail today
and I performed reading it."

478
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,236
"I can't write if no one is watching."

479
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,822
"I can't stop checking my pussy
for weird bumps."

480
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:30,076
"One time I went to the doctor and when
she told me I gained fifteen pounds,

481
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:33,162
I was like, 'That's a lot.'
And she was just like, 'Yeah.'"

482
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:35,998
Thank you.

483
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:47,426
I love sex because it famously
has no consequences.

484
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:53,933
I was recently at the Newark Airport.
Brag.

485
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:58,938
And I saw a headline on a magazine.
Vintage.

486
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:04,068
And it read, "Couple fucks themselves
off side of cliff."

487
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,445
Where were you?

488
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,365
When you found out?

489
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:11,784
How you were going to die?

490
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:15,246
Because for me, I was like,
"Oh, that's an option."

491
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:19,333
I love fuck.

492
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:23,546
I have some sexual fantasies
I want to share with you all.

493
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:27,007
My first sexual fantasy is that
I'm in a mahogany room.

494
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,969
Built-in bookcases. Built-in bookcases.
Built-in bookcases.

495
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:32,304
And I'm sitting in
a velvet wingback chair.

496
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:35,808
And I put my ring finger to my temple
and I just say, "Ugh.

497
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:38,769
I worry. I do."

498
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:43,691
And then my other sexual fantasy

499
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:47,069
is that he makes me cum, damn it.

500
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:51,490
Am I right, ladies? Is that a lot to ask?
Honey, I'm looking for a guy tall enough

501
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:54,076
that I don't have to get on my knees
when I want to blow him.

502
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,704
That's right. I want to stand up,
dick should be here.

503
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,958
I hooked up with…

504
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:07,381
I hooked up with this guy I met at a bar
because I'm brave, and he was like,

505
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:11,635
"I actually biked to this bar.
I can bike us back to my place."

506
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,596
"You can ride on my pegs."

507
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,598
And I was like,
"Absolutely not."

508
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:21,228
He was like,
"No. it's okay. It can hold 120 pounds."

509
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:25,733
And I was like, "Okay, you don't know
what math is. You are my type."

510
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,362
I just feel like it's like
every chubby girl's nightmare

511
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:32,823
to be carried in a playful way.

512
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:37,077
Like, I'm pretty sure when I was born,
the nurse, like, picked me up

513
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,873
and handed me to my mom, and I was like,
"It's okay. You can put me down."

514
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:44,793
It's sad.

515
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:50,007
After I slept with him, I woke up with a,
say it with me, bump on my pussy.

516
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,551
Just lucky, I guess. Foot pop, <i>j'adore.</i>

517
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:56,847
And I was like, "Great. I need to
reach out to my gynecologist about this."

518
00:41:56,931 --> 00:42:00,309
So, I had to access her through,
say it with me, The Portal.

519
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:02,811
I'm s…

520
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:06,565
Why are doctors
absolutely, clinically addicted

521
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:09,026
to making you enter through a portal?
It's like…

522
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,569
"I'm here."

523
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:14,823
It's like, "Can I just get an email or…"
They want you to be like…

524
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:20,496
They want you to be full Narnia vibes
to talk to them about your broken pussy.

525
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:23,332
A portal? Oh, my God. What year is it?

526
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:25,834
Okay. I don't… I hate sci-fi.

527
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:29,004
There's enough…
There's enough stuff here…

528
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:32,633
that's really interesting.

529
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:36,387
We don't have to… We don't have to…
I don't need anything with wings.

530
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,139
Bitch, I have 'em.

531
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:42,601
Oh, my God. So, I was like,

532
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:45,729
"I need to take a picture of this
to send to my gynecologist."

533
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,398
So, I went into my studio,

534
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:51,193
which is obviously an empty room
with a full-size mattress on the floor.

535
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:52,945
And I took out my camera,

536
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:55,155
which is obviously
an iPhone rose gold Plus

537
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,366
with a cracked screen, 'cause I'm fun.

538
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:03,080
Spread my lips and I took an image.

539
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,293
I wish that were the end of the story.

540
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,005
I'm going to do a lap.

541
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:14,466
When I looked at that image, um…

542
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:16,552
Are you okay to hear this?

543
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:18,679
Ally.

544
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:24,393
Feminist ally. When I looked at the image,

545
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:27,187
it was one of the most
harrowing things I've ever seen.

546
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:32,568
One, I used flash. Rookie mistake.

547
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:36,822
Two, I didn't understand
the reach of my camera.

548
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:38,991
So, when I looked at the picture,

549
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:42,661
I didn't only see my spread pussy lips,
which I expected.

550
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:47,875
But, in the background, I saw what can
only be described as my dead-eyed face.

551
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,465
No expression.
Just a corpse's head, really.

552
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:56,508
So, I had to crop that out
for legal reasons.

553
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:57,676
And when I sent it to my gyne,

554
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,762
she was like,
"There's nothing wrong with you."

555
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:02,348
I know there's a long history
of doctors not believing women,

556
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:05,017
but in my case,
doctors shouldn't believe me because

557
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,519
I'm what many medical professionals
have called

558
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:10,064
a dumbass bitch. Thank you to my fans.

559
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:13,984
But it was stressful. Oh, my God.

560
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:16,445
And the thing about stress

561
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:19,156
is that when you're stressed
in New York City,

562
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:20,991
there's only one place to go.

563
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:13,877
Oh!

564
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,963
Ooh, look at all the trees,
I'm worldbuilding.

565
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:17,840
Look at all those trees.

566
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:19,299
Wow.

567
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:05,906
He was so tall.

568
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:25,133
Help. Help. Spin. Fuck!

569
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:57,184
Hide your boners, boys.

570
00:48:57,267 --> 00:49:01,480
I have a hormone disorder in my ovaries.

571
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:04,983
Okay. Everyone's rock-hard in the crowd.

572
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:09,821
I have polycystic ovarian syndrome, PCOS,

573
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,531
or "Pecos" for cute. Boop, boop, boop.

574
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:18,413
Everything online about women's health
is like, "We don't know."

575
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:22,584
I get really bad migraines
with visual auras.

576
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:25,170
Which means I'm inherently interesting.

577
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,964
And when you ask a doctor,
"What are migraines?"

578
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:29,341
They're all just like…

579
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:32,719
So I have PCOS.

580
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,471
Let me tell you about PCOS.

581
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:36,765
It's honestly iconic. Um…

582
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:40,519
The symptoms are one, you're fat.
No, stop. Two,

583
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:43,438
you are losing hair on your head,

584
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:46,149
but, three, you have hair on your face,
and four, you have acne.

585
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:47,776
So, it's sort of this, like,

586
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:49,861
waking nightmare
in which you're both young

587
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:52,072
and old at the same time.

588
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:54,116
It's like that optical illusion

589
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:57,661
where the young woman's looking away
and the old woman's looking down.

590
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:05,210
But in this case, it's just you
looking at yourself in the mirror

591
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:08,380
thinking, "Maybe God isn't a woman."

592
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:14,886
But if she is, I want to meet her.

593
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:18,724
Um, if I have to die,
which I'm not super interested in,

594
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:21,476
I know that, literally, on my death bed,

595
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,604
I'll be, like, surrounded
by millions of loved ones.

596
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:27,190
And in my last dying breath
I'll be like…

597
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:35,282
"Does my hair look better

598
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:39,911
half up or full down?"

599
00:50:41,037 --> 00:50:43,749
Those are a hundy p
gonna be my last words.

600
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:47,335
How I really want to die is
hosting a fabulous dinner party.

601
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:49,713
Twelve people. Yeah.
My apartment in my fantasy

602
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:51,673
you can have a table that that's big.

603
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:53,258
That's that's big.

604
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:54,801
That's that big.

605
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,678
Hard to say, easy to write.

606
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:57,846
Came to me like that.

607
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,975
Ooh.

608
00:51:02,058 --> 00:51:03,310
<i>J'adore.</i> I can't…

609
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:05,854
I literally don't know
a single word of French.

610
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:07,272
English, I can do.

611
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:12,944
Oh, my God. I once was studying abroad,
'cause I'm so interesting.

612
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:14,988
And I was studying abroad

613
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:19,618
and I was out clubbing
with these, like, hot Italian guys.

614
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:22,954
And they were like…
They were like,

615
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:25,332
"Your English is really good."

616
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:31,463
And I was like, "Mm-hmm."

617
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:35,091
At first I was like,
"It's the only language I speak."

618
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:38,303
But then I thought about it
and I was like,

619
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,597
"My English <i>is</i> really good."

620
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:46,520
And what's so bad
about taking a compliment?

621
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:50,315
Especially as women.
Especially in this industry.

622
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:52,359
We have to learn to stop apologizing

623
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:55,278
and just say,
"Yeah. My English is really good."

624
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:01,952
So, how I want to die
is I'm at this dinner party

625
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:04,913
and everyone's having
their own bottle of wine,

626
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:07,249
and that's normal and fine
and no one notices.

627
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:12,128
And then the person next to me goes,
"Oh, my God. I love that painting."

628
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:14,422
And I say, "Oh, thank you.
My friend painted that."

629
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:17,425
And then later in the evening,
I'm lying in bed with my lover.

630
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:19,928
And he looks to me and he says,
"What's wrong?"

631
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:23,139
And I say, "You know, I just…"

632
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:27,394
"I feel a kind of longing
that resembles sadness

633
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:30,939
only in the way that mist resembles rain."

634
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:32,357
And then I expire.

635
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:38,947
And he's like,
"Was that a Wordsworth poem?"

636
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:42,117
And I'm like, "I think it was Longfellow.
Can't remember."

637
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:44,536
From beyond.

638
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:47,247
From the beyond
we argue about who wrote that line.

639
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,832
Um, goals.

640
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,919
I am in love right now,
as insane as that sounds.

641
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:55,839
I know.

642
00:52:56,506 --> 00:53:01,803
And the only way I'll be single again
is if he gets hit by a bus, which is…

643
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:04,931
For some reason, I'm like,
"That's such a common way to die."

644
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,475
Is it?

645
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,186
Okay. Now, I'm living in fear…

646
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:12,856
for the first time ever.

647
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:16,776
If I have to be single again,
that'd be a disaster.

648
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:20,822
But in the meantime, I wrote this anthem
for anyone out there who is single,

649
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:22,198
who is looking for love,

650
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:23,658
because I want love.

651
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:25,327
Because, well,

652
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,661
I want everything.

653
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:06,362
I don't think she knows what it means.

654
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:08,782
She also told me I look like Jared Leto.
Different story.

655
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:23,333
- Ugh.

656
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:21,224
Thank you. Good night.

657
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:38,199
<i>- Whoo!</i>
