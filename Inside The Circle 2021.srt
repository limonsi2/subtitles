[light, playful music]

5
00:00:23,264 --> 00:00:24,645
[woman] Of course.

6
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:26,716
I'm gonna take the documents
with me to my house.

7
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:27,579
I know.

8
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:34,206
[man] You don't understand how
important this is for me.

9
00:00:34,241 --> 00:00:35,966
Just text me the address.

10
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:37,692
I'll be there as
fast as Superman.

11
00:00:40,592 --> 00:00:44,216
[woman] Yes, I'll read them and
study them during the weekend.

12
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:46,598
On Monday, I'll call
you to discuss them.

13
00:00:46,632 --> 00:00:49,049
I know how important this
case is for the firm.

14
00:00:51,706 --> 00:00:52,949
[man] Yeah, I'll be there soon.

15
00:00:52,983 --> 00:00:55,158
I have a surprise for
you. You'll love it.

16
00:00:55,193 --> 00:00:56,642
Gotta go, bye.

17
00:00:56,677 --> 00:00:59,128

[muffled music playing]

22
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:00,120
Wait, she said yes.

23
00:02:00,154 --> 00:02:02,605
Of course. Why wouldn't
she wanna date a doctor?

24
00:02:03,157 --> 00:02:05,884
You know, that's when
relationships never last.

25
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:07,506
Rocio!

26
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:08,887
Why are you so late?

27
00:02:10,026 --> 00:02:12,960
Oh, there was so much traffic.

28
00:02:12,994 --> 00:02:15,411
There was like 100 accidents.

29
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,034
You look like you need a drink.

30
00:02:18,897 --> 00:02:20,001
Let me know how it is.

31
00:02:20,899 --> 00:02:23,522
[upbeat music]

32
00:02:23,557 --> 00:02:24,799
-Delicious.
-Yeah.

33
00:02:26,111 --> 00:02:27,768
All right, well, I gotta
go make some drinks.

34
00:02:27,802 --> 00:02:29,666
But you, you keep drinking,

35
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:33,256
because tonight we
celebrate! [laughs]

36
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,223
What are we celebrating?

37
00:02:34,257 --> 00:02:35,603
I just graduated med school.

38
00:02:35,638 --> 00:02:37,743
Thanks again for
lending me your patio.

39
00:02:37,778 --> 00:02:39,055
He met another girl today.

40
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,298
And he's a doctor now?

41
00:02:40,332 --> 00:02:41,161
Mm-hm.

42
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:42,369
Oh my God.

43
00:02:42,403 --> 00:02:43,887
But I do need to vent
about my mother-in-law.

44
00:02:43,922 --> 00:02:46,442
Oh, you always need to vent
about your mother-in-law.

45
00:02:46,476 --> 00:02:50,308
Sacramento is the worst
place for a honeymoon.

46
00:02:50,341 --> 00:02:51,930
But Steven said yes?

47
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:53,828
Of course he said yes.
He's a mama's boy.

48
00:02:53,863 --> 00:02:55,140
He'll do whatever she says.

49
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,522
But you don't need
to agree, do you?

50
00:02:57,555 --> 00:02:58,799
I know.

51
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,352
But that's where she
had her honeymoon,

52
00:03:00,387 --> 00:03:02,734
and she really wants it, and
she's paying for everything.

53
00:03:03,286 --> 00:03:04,563
So...

54
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:07,256
No, no, no, if it was
me, I wouldn't care.

55
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,947
Yeah, well, when you
live with someone,

56
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:11,225
you have to compromise, a lot.

57
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,020
Otherwise, it's
not gonna work out.

58
00:03:13,054 --> 00:03:13,883
[sighs]

59
00:03:13,917 --> 00:03:15,988
And I don't wanna end up alone.

60
00:03:16,023 --> 00:03:18,853
And I wanna have
kids, at least five.

61
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,132
I just wanna have the
life that I dreamed of

62
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:23,444
when I was five years old.

63
00:03:26,551 --> 00:03:28,173
Are you listening to me?

64
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,036
Rocio?

65
00:03:30,762 --> 00:03:34,283
Yes, yes. Sorry, I just
got a little distracted.

66
00:03:34,317 --> 00:03:37,043
But yeah, I am so happy for you.

67
00:03:37,078 --> 00:03:38,252
Alright, enough about me.

68
00:03:39,357 --> 00:03:40,254
What about you?

69
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:41,255
I know you've been dating.

70
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,016
Ugh, that's a nightmare.

71
00:03:44,051 --> 00:03:46,156
I'm just so tired
of having bad dates.

72
00:03:47,572 --> 00:03:51,576
It's like every single guy in
this city is a narcissistic,

73
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:56,097
superficial, egocentrical guy.

74
00:03:56,132 --> 00:03:57,616
It's so frustrating.

75
00:03:57,651 --> 00:04:01,206
And when you feel like you
finally find a good one,

76
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:05,348
well, those are the worst,
because they lie to your face.

77
00:04:05,383 --> 00:04:07,108
You can't trust anyone.

78
00:04:11,527 --> 00:04:12,355
Who's that guy?

79
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,394
Oh, I don't know, probably
one of Justin's geek friends.

80
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,880
[soft music]

81
00:04:22,745 --> 00:04:23,918
What?

82
00:04:23,953 --> 00:04:25,161
You look like an idiot.

83
00:04:25,195 --> 00:04:28,613
I got it, I got it,
I freaking got it.

84
00:04:28,647 --> 00:04:29,890
-No!
-Oh yes.

85
00:04:29,924 --> 00:04:31,201
Yo, did you get the pages?

86
00:04:31,236 --> 00:04:33,825
The Owners, Issue Number One.

87
00:04:33,859 --> 00:04:35,620
What the fuck, how?

88
00:04:35,654 --> 00:04:38,036
A friend of a friend of
a friend, of a friend.

89
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,864
[laughing]

90
00:04:38,899 --> 00:04:40,314
Lucky bastard.

91
00:04:40,349 --> 00:04:43,248
Come on, let's go introduce
you to some ladies, huh?

92
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,802
You, my friend, deserve it.

93
00:04:45,837 --> 00:04:48,736
Positive energy attracts
positive thoughts.

94
00:04:48,771 --> 00:04:51,912
And positive thoughts make
your heart's desires come true.

95
00:04:51,946 --> 00:04:53,810
Stop reciting Kaon, okay.

96
00:04:53,845 --> 00:04:55,709
You just got lucky.

97
00:04:55,743 --> 00:04:57,227
Oh, you know that
girl I asked out?

98
00:04:57,262 --> 00:04:58,159
Yeah.

99
00:04:58,194 --> 00:04:58,953
We're going out tomorrow.

100
00:04:58,988 --> 00:04:59,782
Really?

101
00:04:59,816 --> 00:05:01,024
Yeah.

102
00:05:01,059 --> 00:05:02,129
[laughs] You're
gonna get caught.

103
00:05:02,163 --> 00:05:03,233
Dude, stop lying.

104
00:05:03,268 --> 00:05:04,718
Eh, we're young and wild.

105
00:05:04,752 --> 00:05:06,720
And stupid. I mean
you are, I'm not.

106
00:05:08,066 --> 00:05:11,759
Ladies, allow me to
introduce you to Giancarlo.

107
00:05:11,794 --> 00:05:14,555
Rocio, Giancarlo.
Natalie, Giancarlo.

108
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,177
Hi.

109
00:05:16,212 --> 00:05:17,040
Nice to meet you.

110
00:05:19,491 --> 00:05:20,354
Hi.

111
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:22,218
Hi, nice to meet you.

112
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,464
[Rocio] Nice shirt.

113
00:05:26,498 --> 00:05:28,224
Oh, thanks.

114
00:05:28,258 --> 00:05:29,156
Cool colors.

115
00:05:32,815 --> 00:05:34,748
Okay, let's go,
Giancarlo. Two more.

116
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,200
Okay, so I'm definitely
gonna rewrite them.

117
00:05:39,235 --> 00:05:40,616
Been going on for
the last two months.

118
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:41,893
Hi.

119
00:05:41,927 --> 00:05:44,413
[light music]

120
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:46,691
Your panties are showing.

121
00:05:47,761 --> 00:05:48,658
What?

122
00:05:48,693 --> 00:05:52,524
[whispering in foreign language]

123
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,494
I'm sorry, but I needed
to say something.

124
00:05:56,528 --> 00:05:58,358
I don't know why no
one has said anything.

125
00:06:00,187 --> 00:06:01,015
Asshole.

126
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:06,366
[soft piano music]

127
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,890
[phone vibrating]

128
00:06:20,587 --> 00:06:21,484
Hello.

129
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,727
[Giancarlo on phone] Hi, Rocio?

130
00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:25,143
Yes.

131
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:28,871
It's Giancarlo. I met you
at Justin's party last week.

132
00:06:30,976 --> 00:06:33,220
He gave me your
cellphone number.

133
00:06:35,222 --> 00:06:38,398
Of course, how can I forget you?

134
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:41,055
Yeah, I, I feel bad

135
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,919
and I wanted to apologize.

136
00:06:45,474 --> 00:06:46,647
What are you doing now?

137
00:06:47,752 --> 00:06:49,788
What do you mean?

138
00:06:49,823 --> 00:06:50,720
Can I pick you up?

139
00:06:50,755 --> 00:06:52,515
No, I have a date.

140
00:06:53,827 --> 00:06:54,931
With who?

141
00:06:54,966 --> 00:06:56,519
That's none of your business.

142
00:06:58,176 --> 00:07:02,939
It's four PM, so it's probably
the first date with him.

143
00:07:02,974 --> 00:07:05,217
What's wrong with you?

144
00:07:05,252 --> 00:07:07,668
I told you, that's
none of your business.

145
00:07:07,703 --> 00:07:08,600
Sorry.

146
00:07:08,635 --> 00:07:09,843
Stop saying that you're sorry.

147
00:07:09,877 --> 00:07:12,190
I don't think you're
actually being honest.

148
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:15,849
Yeah, I'm not, because I'm
not saying anything wrong.

149
00:07:17,022 --> 00:07:18,299
I mean, it's what
people like to hear.

150
00:07:18,334 --> 00:07:20,474
A fake apology?

151
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:22,131
You want me to be honest?

152
00:07:22,165 --> 00:07:23,650
Yeah.

153
00:07:23,684 --> 00:07:27,136
I mean you were very honest
telling me that I had a hole

154
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,794
in my pants and that my
panties were very bright.

155
00:07:29,828 --> 00:07:31,485
Because they were bright red.

156
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,555
Whatever.

157
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,419
Look, Giancarlo, it
was nice to meet you,

158
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,076
but I actually need to go.

159
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,216
No, no, no, just
wait, just wait.

160
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,874
You just told me to be honest.

161
00:07:40,908 --> 00:07:43,635
Okay, can I ask you a question?

162
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,188
Okay, go ahead.

163
00:07:45,223 --> 00:07:48,709
The date that you're going
on, is it your first date?

164
00:07:48,744 --> 00:07:49,676
Yes.

165
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:50,780
Do you like the guy?

166
00:07:50,815 --> 00:07:52,851
Basically, yes, he's attractive,

167
00:07:52,886 --> 00:07:54,266
but as a person, I don't know.

168
00:07:54,301 --> 00:07:55,578
That's why I'm going
out on a date with him.

169
00:07:55,613 --> 00:07:57,477
Do you really wanna
go on this date?

170
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:58,719
No.

171
00:07:58,754 --> 00:08:01,653
In a perfect world, what
do you really wanna do?

172
00:08:01,688 --> 00:08:03,413
Like right now.

173
00:08:03,448 --> 00:08:06,313
Mm, I don't know.

174
00:08:06,347 --> 00:08:08,246
What are you now, a reporter?

175
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,490
Just bear with me, please.

176
00:08:12,871 --> 00:08:14,977
[scoffs] I don't know if you're
trying to manipulate me

177
00:08:15,011 --> 00:08:16,634
or if you're just crazy.

178
00:08:16,668 --> 00:08:21,052
So it was nice talking to
you, Giancarlo, okay, bye.

179
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:27,990
[traffic passing]

180

00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,837
What do I really want?

183
00:09:21,871 --> 00:09:24,460
[gentle music]

184
00:09:35,298 --> 00:09:37,956
[phone dialing]

185
00:09:42,478 --> 00:09:45,032
[phone ringing]

186
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:46,758
Hey, it's me.

187
00:09:53,178 --> 00:09:54,732
-Hey.
-Hey.

188
00:09:56,043 --> 00:09:57,597
I was not expecting the call.

189
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,428
Well, I been thinking a
lot about what you say.

190
00:10:01,462 --> 00:10:04,707
When you asked,
what do I wanna do?

191
00:10:04,742 --> 00:10:08,297
And what I wanna do
is have a nice walk

192
00:10:08,331 --> 00:10:09,781
and a good conversation.

193
00:10:10,989 --> 00:10:12,646
So, hope you don't
disappoint me.

194
00:10:14,544 --> 00:10:15,476
Ouch.

195
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:20,930
So, the date wasn't
that great, huh?

196
00:10:20,965 --> 00:10:24,175
It was fine, I guess.
He was a nice guy.

197
00:10:25,555 --> 00:10:27,281
Do you date a lot?

198
00:10:27,316 --> 00:10:29,214
Mm, not much.

199
00:10:29,249 --> 00:10:30,457
I'm always busy.

200
00:10:31,561 --> 00:10:32,390
Working?

201
00:10:33,702 --> 00:10:34,530
Yeah.

202
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,808
What do you do?

203
00:10:38,845 --> 00:10:41,261
I am a lawyer, a
business lawyer.

204
00:10:41,295 --> 00:10:44,574
Ooh, that sounds busy.

205
00:10:44,609 --> 00:10:46,438
Yes, it can get a little hectic.

206
00:10:47,923 --> 00:10:49,131
What do you do?

207
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,444
What do I do, or
if I date or not?

208
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:54,861
-Both.
-[laughs]

209
00:10:56,483 --> 00:10:58,727
I'm an app developer.

210
00:10:58,761 --> 00:11:02,247
I have my own company, and no,

211
00:11:02,282 --> 00:11:04,215
I don't date that much anymore.

212
00:11:05,354 --> 00:11:06,079
Hm.

213
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:09,392
And what type of apps do you do?

214
00:11:09,427 --> 00:11:12,119
I'm actually developing
a very cool one.

215
00:11:12,154 --> 00:11:13,327
But this one, I'm
doing it for myself,

216
00:11:13,362 --> 00:11:15,882
not for any company,
I do freelance.

217
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,263
I call it Mentira.

218
00:11:18,298 --> 00:11:21,232
It's kind of a lie detector
for your cellphone.

219
00:11:21,266 --> 00:11:24,925
It detects your voice,
like the steadiness of it,

220
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,238
and then decides if you're
telling the truth or not.

221
00:11:27,272 --> 00:11:29,171
Hm, sounds interesting.

222
00:11:29,205 --> 00:11:31,069
But how does it work?

223
00:11:31,104 --> 00:11:33,796
It just speaks
through the speakers,

224
00:11:33,831 --> 00:11:37,110
the cellphone speakers,
and then it would say

225
00:11:37,144 --> 00:11:38,905
like "lie" or "true."

226
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:46,947
So, why don't you date
that much anymore?

227
00:11:48,431 --> 00:11:52,712
It's not that I don't date
or I don't like to date.

228
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:56,060
It just doesn't
interest me as much.

229
00:11:56,094 --> 00:11:58,994
Like the other older I
get, the more I realize

230
00:11:59,028 --> 00:12:02,480
that I waste more time
dating than not dating.

231
00:12:04,793 --> 00:12:06,518
Hm, what do you mean?

232
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,867
If I date because
I need to date,

233
00:12:09,901 --> 00:12:12,766
I feel like I wasted
my time and money.

234
00:12:14,216 --> 00:12:17,978
If I'm not doing it, I do a
lot of things that I love.

235
00:12:18,013 --> 00:12:21,879
And the older I get, the
more the things that I love

236
00:12:21,913 --> 00:12:23,259
that I wanna do.

237
00:12:24,467 --> 00:12:28,092
Okay, but what if
time keeps passing

238
00:12:28,126 --> 00:12:30,025
and you don't find
your soulmate?

239
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:31,785
You're gonna end up alone.

240
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,752
No.

241
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:34,823
You know what, that
would be fantastic.

242
00:12:34,857 --> 00:12:35,685
What?

243
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,066
Because it means
I did what I love

244
00:12:37,101 --> 00:12:37,964
with the time that I had.

245
00:12:39,103 --> 00:12:43,866
You know, in time, I love to be

246
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:46,662
in an empty room, I
love the quietness

247
00:12:46,696 --> 00:12:48,491
and the solitude of a space.

248
00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:50,528
It gives me peace.

249
00:12:51,391 --> 00:12:53,255
You say that.

250
00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:56,189
But the reality is that
nobody wants to be alone.

251
00:12:56,223 --> 00:12:57,431
Nobody wants to be.

252
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:00,607
That's why you're here.

253
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:04,438
No, I'm here because
I wanna be here,

254
00:13:04,473 --> 00:13:06,130
not because I don't
wanna be alone.

255
00:13:08,442 --> 00:13:12,584
I, I learned over time
to be honest with myself,

256
00:13:12,619 --> 00:13:17,279
in everything I do, with time,
love, life, work, everything.

257
00:13:20,247 --> 00:13:22,663
Well, good for you.

258
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,735
That sounds depressing.

259
00:13:26,633 --> 00:13:28,255
Really, what's depressing?

260
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:30,568
Wanting to be alone on purpose.

261
00:13:31,638 --> 00:13:33,709
Okay, Miss Relationship Expert,

262
00:13:33,743 --> 00:13:35,918
so how's that working for you?

263
00:13:35,953 --> 00:13:40,785
Well, not great, but at
least I'm trying, you know?

264
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,375
And, one day I'll find true love

265
00:13:44,409 --> 00:13:48,137
and a great husband, and
I'll have beautiful kids.

266
00:13:51,658 --> 00:13:53,280
That sounds good, and

267
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:56,974
that's depressing.

268
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:00,391
Wait, why is that depressing?

269
00:14:00,425 --> 00:14:03,118
Because it looks like your
whole idea of happiness

270
00:14:03,152 --> 00:14:04,602
is based on an
event that you have

271
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:07,018
not accomplished just yet.

272
00:14:07,053 --> 00:14:10,021
It means that right
now, at this instant,

273
00:14:10,056 --> 00:14:11,885
your life is not fulfilled.

274
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,957
Okay, what would happen if
you never find your husband

275
00:14:14,992 --> 00:14:19,410
or if you would never get
married or can have kids?

276
00:14:20,618 --> 00:14:22,240
What exactly are
you doing right now?

277
00:14:22,275 --> 00:14:23,655
Not being completely happy?

278
00:14:25,588 --> 00:14:27,521
I'm happy. Okay, I am.

279
00:14:27,556 --> 00:14:28,902
I'm great, actually.

280
00:14:28,937 --> 00:14:31,940
I have a great
job, and I, and I,

281
00:14:31,974 --> 00:14:34,080
am saving to buy a house,
and my mom's healthy

282
00:14:34,114 --> 00:14:36,668
and I am healthy, so yes,
I'm happy, thank you.

283
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:40,500
[soft music]

284
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:45,229
We can change topics
if you want to.

285
00:14:46,092 --> 00:14:47,921
Yes, let's do that.

286
00:14:47,956 --> 00:14:49,992
Did you fix your pants?

287
00:14:50,027 --> 00:14:52,926
Yes, I did. I stapled them.

288
00:14:54,445 --> 00:14:55,895
What do you mean
you stapled them?

289
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:58,898
I stapled the freaking hole
so my bright red panties

290
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:00,934
wouldn't shine on
everyone's faces.

291
00:15:02,453 --> 00:15:05,352
-[laughing]
-Yes, I did.

292
00:15:05,387 --> 00:15:07,596
[laughing]

293
00:15:11,876 --> 00:15:13,740
Thank you for the walk.

294
00:15:13,774 --> 00:15:16,467
It was, interesting.

295
00:15:17,502 --> 00:15:19,573
Thank you for calling me.

296
00:15:23,025 --> 00:15:25,959
Have a good night,
okay? Drive safe.

297
00:15:25,994 --> 00:15:26,995
Okay.

298
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:27,892
Night.

299
00:15:28,755 --> 00:15:30,067
I'll...I'll...

300
00:15:31,206 --> 00:15:32,069
see you around?

301
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:34,657
Yeah.

302
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:41,285
Bye.

303
00:15:41,906 --> 00:15:44,046
[soft music]

304
00:15:50,777 --> 00:15:52,641
Rocio, Rocio, wait, wait.

305
00:15:53,538 --> 00:15:55,506
What happened?

306
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:59,096
What are you gonna
do next Saturday?

307
00:15:59,130 --> 00:15:59,959
Wait.

308
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:03,686
What happened with "Mr.
I Don't Like to Date"?

309
00:16:03,721 --> 00:16:05,274
What I said was that I
don't like it date

310
00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:09,071
because of the heck of dating
or because I wanna be alone,

311
00:16:09,106 --> 00:16:12,488
or because I wanna score,
if you know what I mean.

312
00:16:14,145 --> 00:16:14,974
No thanks.

313
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:16,906
Wait, what? No, what?

314
00:16:16,941 --> 00:16:19,288
No, I don't wanna date with you?

315
00:16:19,323 --> 00:16:22,843
But I wanna date you.
I wanna know you.

316
00:16:22,878 --> 00:16:23,983
It's a choice.

317
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:27,710
What do you really want?

318
00:16:27,745 --> 00:16:30,334
[gentle music]

319
00:16:34,407 --> 00:16:35,339
Okay, fine.

320
00:16:38,411 --> 00:16:39,826
Really?

321
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,553
Yes. Why, am I making
a bad choice here?

322
00:16:42,587 --> 00:16:44,210
No no, no no, you're
making a great decision.

323
00:16:44,244 --> 00:16:46,419
You're good. Thank you.

324
00:16:46,453 --> 00:16:47,351
For what?

325
00:16:47,385 --> 00:16:48,421
For saying yes.

326
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:52,045
Oh my God, please stop.

327
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,909
Okay, I'll call you.

328
00:16:53,943 --> 00:16:54,841
Okay.

329
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:55,704
Okay.

330
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:57,844
Bye.

331
00:16:57,878 --> 00:17:00,467
[gentle music]

332
00:17:26,804 --> 00:17:29,703
[knocking on door]

333
00:17:32,189 --> 00:17:34,122
You don't need to staple
your pants anymore.

334
00:17:34,156 --> 00:17:35,537
What?

335
00:17:35,571 --> 00:17:38,954
First of all, it's
just a pair of pants.

336
00:17:38,988 --> 00:17:41,336
And second of all,
who the hell uses

337
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:43,476
a freaking sewing
machine nowadays?

338
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,581
You never know. It
can come in handy.

339
00:17:45,616 --> 00:17:46,962
Do you know how to use one?

340
00:17:46,996 --> 00:17:47,825
No.

341
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:50,793
Okay, thanks.

342
00:17:50,828 --> 00:17:52,726
I thought it was a nice gesture.

343
00:17:52,761 --> 00:17:54,176
Nope, it wasn't.

344
00:17:55,971 --> 00:17:58,560
[gentle music]

345
00:18:05,843 --> 00:18:06,913
What is that?

346
00:18:06,947 --> 00:18:10,261
Oh, that's, uh, sorry.

347
00:18:13,057 --> 00:18:13,885
It's fine.

348
00:18:15,024 --> 00:18:19,167
That's the symbol of
Kaon. He's a superhero.

349
00:18:19,201 --> 00:18:22,308
I love superhero
movies and comic books.

350
00:18:22,342 --> 00:18:25,242
Are you one of those guys
that goes to those conventions

351
00:18:25,276 --> 00:18:29,418
and dresses up like superheroes?

352
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,973
Yes, I love those conventions.

353
00:18:33,008 --> 00:18:36,770
And no, I don't dress
up. Too much work.

354
00:18:36,805 --> 00:18:38,634
I'll never understand why people

355
00:18:38,669 --> 00:18:41,050
like that so much, you know?

356
00:18:41,085 --> 00:18:44,157
I don't know. I just
grew up with them.

357
00:18:44,192 --> 00:18:46,228
Making me believe that
I could accomplish

358
00:18:47,229 --> 00:18:48,403
anything that I wanted.

359
00:18:50,025 --> 00:18:51,130
This sounds weird, but

360
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:55,617
if you apply what I call
the superhero philosophy

361
00:18:55,651 --> 00:18:59,103
into your own life, like
you put positive thoughts

362
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,417
into your head and
you act on them,

363
00:19:03,556 --> 00:19:04,902
you can make things
happen for you.

364
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:07,732
Like, good things.

365
00:19:07,767 --> 00:19:08,940
Like flying?

366
00:19:08,975 --> 00:19:11,495
[laughing]

367
00:19:11,529 --> 00:19:12,358
No.

368
00:19:13,221 --> 00:19:15,361
Like hope.

369
00:19:17,052 --> 00:19:18,329
You know Superman, yeah?

370
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:21,125
Yes.

371
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,853
The S on Superman's
costume represents hope,

372
00:19:24,887 --> 00:19:27,304
and looking at that
fictional symbol,

373
00:19:27,338 --> 00:19:30,307
it remind you of
a positive word,

374
00:19:30,341 --> 00:19:32,585
like a powerful feeling.

375
00:19:33,793 --> 00:19:35,864
And I think we need a
lot of that nowadays.

376
00:19:39,523 --> 00:19:41,283
Where are we going?

377
00:19:41,318 --> 00:19:44,113
If you don't mind, I
need to go back home.

378
00:19:44,148 --> 00:19:45,529
I left my wallet there.

379
00:19:45,563 --> 00:19:48,221
Oh don't worry. I can
totally pay for both of us.

380
00:19:48,256 --> 00:19:51,949
Oh no, no, I invited you,
and I wanna treat you.

381
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:53,226
And it's not a male thing.

382
00:19:53,261 --> 00:19:55,918
I just wanna treat you.

383
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:04,306
Welcome to my
superhero art gallery.

384
00:20:04,341 --> 00:20:06,964
[gentle music]

385
00:20:12,314 --> 00:20:13,281
I like this one.

386
00:20:18,734 --> 00:20:23,739
I like the colors and the
details of the anatomy.

387
00:20:26,155 --> 00:20:29,435
It's by a famous
comic book artist.

388
00:20:29,469 --> 00:20:31,091
I have lot of his stuff.

389
00:20:36,131 --> 00:20:37,028
Very impressive.

390
00:20:41,964 --> 00:20:42,931
What's that?

391
00:20:44,381 --> 00:20:46,900
Oh, I was doing exercise.

392
00:20:46,935 --> 00:20:48,385
With a regular rope?

393
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:51,284
Yeah, you can do a lot
of stuff with a big rope.

394
00:20:54,701 --> 00:20:57,359
Did you find that
wallet? I'm kinda hungry.

395
00:20:57,394 --> 00:20:59,327
Okay, just one second.

396
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:06,575
Do you know, the one
you like, that's Kaon?

397
00:21:07,714 --> 00:21:10,579
He's a Latino superhero.
He's very powerful.

398
00:21:11,822 --> 00:21:14,203
Do you wanna hear Kaon's oath?

399
00:21:14,238 --> 00:21:15,446
I guess.

400
00:21:15,481 --> 00:21:17,483
Okay, all right.

401
00:21:21,487 --> 00:21:24,559
The power within you
is the power within me.

402
00:21:24,593 --> 00:21:26,354
It's the power of the universe.

403
00:21:26,388 --> 00:21:28,045
It's the power of us all.

404
00:21:33,222 --> 00:21:34,051
Wallet.

405
00:21:35,224 --> 00:21:36,398
Yeah.

406
00:21:36,433 --> 00:21:40,057
I just, I just love
this stuff a lot.

407
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:41,472
Yeah, sorry, sorry.

408
00:21:47,616 --> 00:21:48,893
Rocio, I found it.

409
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,825
You wanna come out?

410
00:21:52,414 --> 00:21:54,899
Welcome to Giancarlo's
Casa Restaurant.

411
00:21:57,557 --> 00:22:00,111
Come on in. I know
the lady's hungry.

412
00:22:03,425 --> 00:22:08,085
Wow, I was not
expecting this at all.

413
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:12,261
For someone that
doesn't like to date,

414
00:22:12,296 --> 00:22:14,091
this is very thoughtful.

415
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:18,613
Well, I'm a romantic gentleman,

416
00:22:18,647 --> 00:22:21,685
and I love a moment like this.

417
00:22:24,446 --> 00:22:25,309
Menu?

418
00:22:28,174 --> 00:22:29,002
I'll be back.

419
00:22:29,693 --> 00:22:31,004
Okay.

420
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,524
[light music]

421
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:50,230
I can tell that you
saw the menu already.

422
00:22:51,404 --> 00:22:52,957
Yeah, I love it.

423
00:22:55,028 --> 00:22:56,789
You know why people love food?

424
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,205
Why?

425
00:22:59,239 --> 00:23:03,830
Because it's diverse. Diversity
makes everything better.

426
00:23:05,798 --> 00:23:06,626
Love it.

427
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,079
So,

428
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,359
did you like my menus?

429
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:19,398
Yeah, they seem very creative.

430
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:21,158
I just did it to impress you.

431
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,403
Salut.

432
00:23:26,163 --> 00:23:28,199
[glasses clinking]

433
00:23:28,234 --> 00:23:29,442
Thank you.

434
00:23:29,477 --> 00:23:31,996
[light music]

435
00:23:37,346 --> 00:23:40,004
[phone pinging]

436
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,629
Thank you.

437
00:23:43,663 --> 00:23:44,561
You're welcome.

438
00:23:45,631 --> 00:23:48,323
[phone pinging]

439
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:50,739
Sorry that I'm texting.

440
00:23:50,774 --> 00:23:53,052
It's my mom, but I'm done.

441
00:23:53,086 --> 00:23:53,915
It's okay.

442
00:23:59,955 --> 00:24:01,336
What?

443
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:02,889
You're too young to be a lawyer.

444
00:24:02,924 --> 00:24:05,789
Well, I didn't take any breaks

445
00:24:05,823 --> 00:24:09,033
between high school,
college and law school, so.

446
00:24:10,172 --> 00:24:13,486
I love what I do,
and I do what I love.

447
00:24:13,521 --> 00:24:15,833
Nice, good for you.

448
00:24:15,868 --> 00:24:18,836
Ever since I was a little
girl, my mom raised me

449
00:24:18,871 --> 00:24:22,391
to be, you know,
independent, to study,

450
00:24:22,426 --> 00:24:25,464
to do something for my
own, be my own boss.

451
00:24:26,913 --> 00:24:31,435
And, I mean I'm working at
this law firm right now,

452
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,921
and I'm happy, I'm
actually learning a lot.

453
00:24:34,956 --> 00:24:38,304
But eventually, I'm gonna
start my own business.

454
00:24:38,338 --> 00:24:41,169
I wanna help people to
become entrepreneurs.

455
00:24:41,203 --> 00:24:45,104
You know, just take this
mentality of working

456
00:24:45,138 --> 00:24:48,521
for someone else,
especially as Latinos.

457
00:24:49,418 --> 00:24:52,283
Well, we need people like you.

458
00:24:52,318 --> 00:24:54,734
Smart, and beautiful.

459
00:24:54,769 --> 00:24:56,425
[light music]

460
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,049
Thank you, and
stop hitting on me.

461
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:00,844
I'm not hitting on you.

462
00:25:00,878 --> 00:25:03,294
I'm just complimenting you,

463
00:25:03,329 --> 00:25:05,883
with a little bit
of Latin flavor.

464
00:25:05,918 --> 00:25:07,609
You should stop winking.

465
00:25:07,644 --> 00:25:10,129
You think it makes
you look attractive,

466
00:25:10,163 --> 00:25:12,545
but trust me, it doesn't.

467
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:15,721
I'm joking.

468
00:25:17,654 --> 00:25:19,828
What's the most difficult
case you've had?

469
00:25:20,967 --> 00:25:23,763
Probably the one I just
got a few weeks ago.

470
00:25:23,798 --> 00:25:24,695
It's a tricky one.

471
00:25:25,903 --> 00:25:28,837
This owner of this
huge mall complex

472
00:25:28,872 --> 00:25:31,737
wants to terminate the
lease of a restaurant.

473
00:25:31,771 --> 00:25:33,255
Early termination.

474
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:37,363
And I am convinced that
the reason is racial bias.

475
00:25:37,397 --> 00:25:39,917
The restaurant
owner is Latino, so.

476
00:25:41,091 --> 00:25:42,575
I'm very compelled
about this one.

477
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,922
Actually, I don't know why
I'm talking about this.

478
00:25:44,957 --> 00:25:46,786
I barely know you.

479
00:25:46,821 --> 00:25:47,649
Ouch.

480
00:25:50,721 --> 00:25:52,516
Do you want ketchup?

481
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,000
I like to put
ketchup on the rice.

482
00:25:54,035 --> 00:25:55,346
Just give me one second.

483
00:25:55,381 --> 00:25:56,209
Oh.

484
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,109
With sushi?

485
00:25:59,143 --> 00:25:59,972
Yeah.

486
00:26:04,183 --> 00:26:06,116
Just in case, hot sauce.

487
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,842
[chuckles] Funny.

488
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,089
It seems like you're

489
00:26:14,124 --> 00:26:16,057
doing pretty well
yourself, aren't you?

490
00:26:17,334 --> 00:26:20,095
Yeah, I have your
same mentality.

491
00:26:21,614 --> 00:26:25,031
That's why I have
my own company.

492
00:26:25,066 --> 00:26:28,172
Oh, that's so cool. How
many employees do you have?

493
00:26:28,207 --> 00:26:29,726
Just one.

494
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,867
It gets hectic, between
working for other companies

495
00:26:32,901 --> 00:26:37,665
as a freelance, and developing
Mentira,but I love it.

496
00:26:37,699 --> 00:26:39,287
It feels free.

497
00:26:40,668 --> 00:26:44,050
Is that why you don't
wanna have relationships,

498
00:26:44,085 --> 00:26:46,018
because you like to feel free?

499
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:49,366
Well it's not that I
don't like relationships.

500
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,818
It's just the way we
construct the rules

501
00:26:52,852 --> 00:26:54,613
in regards of relationships,

502
00:26:55,441 --> 00:26:57,443
I just, I don't like it.

503
00:26:58,409 --> 00:26:59,445
I don't fit in.

504
00:27:02,344 --> 00:27:03,863
Mm, better.

505
00:27:03,898 --> 00:27:04,795
What do you mean?

506
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,383
Oh, the flavor the ketchup gives

507
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:08,178
to the rice, it's amazing.

508
00:27:08,212 --> 00:27:10,283
I'm not talking
about your ketchup.

509
00:27:11,457 --> 00:27:15,323
I mean, what do you mean
that you don't fit in?

510
00:27:15,357 --> 00:27:18,740
Based on our culture
that is influenced

511
00:27:18,775 --> 00:27:21,743
by religious beliefs, to be
in a serious relationship,

512
00:27:21,778 --> 00:27:23,469
you need to be married.

513
00:27:23,503 --> 00:27:26,783
If you're a bit more liberal,
at least you need to live

514
00:27:26,817 --> 00:27:30,856
with a person 24 hours a
day, seven days a week.

515
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:33,341
And if you decide to have kids,

516
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:35,274
I mean the normal thing
to do is to marry.

517
00:27:35,308 --> 00:27:38,173
Yes, yes, that's normal.
What's wrong with that?

518
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:41,280
I mean, that's
what's always been.

519
00:27:41,314 --> 00:27:44,248
I mean, we are
genetically social beings.

520
00:27:44,283 --> 00:27:46,872
It's in our genes
to find a partner

521
00:27:46,906 --> 00:27:49,253
and spend the rest of
our lives together.

522
00:27:49,288 --> 00:27:50,392
Yes and no.

523
00:27:50,427 --> 00:27:52,015
Yes, we're genetically
social beings

524
00:27:52,049 --> 00:27:53,879
and yes we're looking
for a partner,

525
00:27:53,913 --> 00:27:57,814
mostly to mate and to
spend time with them.

526
00:27:57,848 --> 00:28:00,955
In regard to spending the
rest of our lives together,

527
00:28:00,989 --> 00:28:02,163
I don't think so.

528
00:28:02,197 --> 00:28:03,716
That's what they
teach us and has been

529
00:28:03,751 --> 00:28:05,304
morally inserted in our minds.

530
00:28:05,338 --> 00:28:06,823
Okay, so what are you saying?

531
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,101
What do you want?

532
00:28:09,135 --> 00:28:11,828
What do I want? I don't
think you'll like my answer.

533
00:28:13,001 --> 00:28:15,486
But, I would love
to live with someone

534
00:28:15,521 --> 00:28:18,075
for four days a week,
and the rest of the days,

535
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,767
I wanna be by myself.

536
00:28:19,801 --> 00:28:22,839
Yeah, you definitely
don't fit the norm of what

537
00:28:22,873 --> 00:28:26,877
most of the world thinks
is a healthy relationship.

538
00:28:26,912 --> 00:28:29,466
Okay, let me ask you a question.

539
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,537
Do you want what you
want because you came up

540
00:28:31,571 --> 00:28:34,402
with that decision, or because
you never had a choice,

541
00:28:34,436 --> 00:28:35,714
even before you were born.

542
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,785
Think about it.

543
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:40,684
Mm, maybe you're right.

544
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:45,344
But, I want what I want,
no matter the reason.

545
00:28:45,378 --> 00:28:47,484
What's wrong with that way?

546
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:50,625
And that's how democracy ends.

547
00:28:50,659 --> 00:28:53,697
You can't dictate
love. No one can.

548
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:57,805
If you do, you will end up
in the 50% divorce statistic.

549
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:01,015
Love is love, as simple as that.

550
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:04,604
And I suggest that, if you
find it, don't mess with it.

551
00:29:04,639 --> 00:29:07,331
Because, you will lose
the chance to feel

552
00:29:07,366 --> 00:29:09,471
the greatest experience of all.

553
00:29:10,472 --> 00:29:11,680
And it's free.

554
00:29:13,613 --> 00:29:15,167
Money can't buy it.

555
00:29:16,513 --> 00:29:18,135
You know, there's a
lot of people that die

556
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:19,654
without ever experience love?

557
00:29:21,932 --> 00:29:23,071
And I think that's sad.

558
00:29:25,073 --> 00:29:28,042
And you are too
cool and beautiful

559
00:29:28,076 --> 00:29:29,422
to let that happen to you.

560
00:29:32,978 --> 00:29:34,980
Are you sure you
don't want ketchup?

561
00:29:36,429 --> 00:29:37,327
I'm sure.

562
00:29:38,915 --> 00:29:39,778
It's good.

563
00:29:41,296 --> 00:29:42,125
I'm good.

564
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,817

[seat belt clicking]

567
00:29:54,171 --> 00:29:56,070
Thank you for dinner.

568
00:29:56,104 --> 00:29:59,556
It was, interesting.

569
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:02,007
And thank you for coming.

570
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:06,528
I never worked so hard to
make that dinner so nice.

571
00:30:08,737 --> 00:30:09,566
And,

572
00:30:11,257 --> 00:30:13,294
I did it for you.

573
00:30:16,228 --> 00:30:17,056
Thanks.

574
00:30:22,199 --> 00:30:25,651
[soft piano music]

575
00:30:25,685 --> 00:30:26,790
What?

576
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,206
[soft music]

577
00:30:43,082 --> 00:30:45,947
I never kiss on the first date.

578
00:30:45,982 --> 00:30:47,500
You just need to say so.

579
00:30:48,674 --> 00:30:50,434
And this is kind
of our second date.

580
00:30:50,469 --> 00:30:52,781
I count our walk
as our first date.

581
00:30:52,816 --> 00:30:53,921
Oh, well.

582
00:30:56,268 --> 00:31:00,306
If that's it, then
I guess it's fine.

583
00:31:00,341 --> 00:31:01,135
Okay.

584
00:31:05,139 --> 00:31:06,830
We want different
things in life.

585
00:31:07,969 --> 00:31:10,799
We don't. We want
the same thing.

586
00:31:10,834 --> 00:31:12,491
Just under different conditions.

587
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:15,287
I'm scared.

588
00:31:15,321 --> 00:31:18,393
Okay, you're overthinking
this way too much.

589
00:31:19,739 --> 00:31:22,846
Just go with the flow.

590
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:26,988
Go with the flow. I
can do that [sighs].

591
00:31:28,748 --> 00:31:30,992
[laughing]

592
00:31:32,821 --> 00:31:33,788
Come here.

593
00:31:33,822 --> 00:31:36,411
[bright music]

594
00:31:38,966 --> 00:31:40,036
I need to go.

595
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,071
Wait, Rocio, wait.

596
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:46,042
To overcome your fears,
you must face them.

597
00:31:47,112 --> 00:31:48,768
Doing so will make you grow.

598
00:31:48,803 --> 00:31:52,048
What starts as fear
would turn into courage.

599
00:31:52,082 --> 00:31:54,705
And courage is what
heroes are made of.

600
00:31:58,606 --> 00:32:00,988
That's a phrase from Kaon.

601
00:32:02,748 --> 00:32:03,818
I wanna break my rule.

602
00:32:04,992 --> 00:32:06,545
I wanna have more
dates with you.

603
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:09,168
Can you break yours?

604
00:32:10,687 --> 00:32:11,895
Which one?

605
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,932
To date someone that
doesn't believe in

606
00:32:13,966 --> 00:32:14,933
what you believe in.

607
00:32:16,693 --> 00:32:18,488
You have my number.

608
00:32:18,522 --> 00:32:19,351
Okay.

609
00:32:21,215 --> 00:32:22,147
Good night.

610
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:24,735
Good night.

-Hola.
-Hola.

616
00:33:06,743 --> 00:33:08,365
Are you free on Friday night?

617
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,297
Yeah.

618
00:33:09,332 --> 00:33:11,886
Great, can you come to my place?

619
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,853
You did something nice for you,

620
00:33:13,888 --> 00:33:15,890
and I wanna do
something nice for you.

621
00:33:15,924 --> 00:33:17,029
Okay.

622
00:33:17,064 --> 00:33:17,996
What are you gonna do?

623
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,963
You'll see. Just come at seven.

624
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:23,380
Okay, and please no
questions. Can you come?

625
00:33:23,415 --> 00:33:24,312
Yeah.

626
00:33:24,347 --> 00:33:27,729
Okay, it's a surprise. Bye.

Breakfast will be
ready in five minutes.

Let me wash my face.

644
00:36:56,421 --> 00:36:58,112
Do you have ketchup?

645
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,977
It's in the cabinet
by the fridge.

646
00:37:04,601 --> 00:37:06,120
I had fun last night.

647
00:37:06,154 --> 00:37:08,295
I never expected for
you to move like that.

648
00:37:11,677 --> 00:37:13,300
I think that's a little
bit inappropriate,

649
00:37:13,334 --> 00:37:15,163
don't you think?

650
00:37:15,198 --> 00:37:16,579
What?

651
00:37:16,613 --> 00:37:19,237
Oh, no no no, I'm not talking
about the sex movements.

652
00:37:19,271 --> 00:37:21,066
I was talking about
the dance movements.

653
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:25,553
Oh, thank you. What
about the sex movements?

654
00:37:25,588 --> 00:37:28,901
The sex movements was fantastic.

655
00:37:28,936 --> 00:37:32,629
Amazing, like, love it.

[bottle squirting]

00:37:33,872 --> 00:37:36,978
Do you put ketchup
on everything?

658
00:37:37,013 --> 00:37:38,808
Yeah, kind of.

659
00:37:39,947 --> 00:37:41,742
I did something for you.

660
00:37:41,776 --> 00:37:44,262
Because I ripped your
favorite panties last night,

661
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:48,300
I fixed them up for you.

662
00:37:48,335 --> 00:37:50,371
Isn't this beauty? Look at this.

663
00:37:50,406 --> 00:37:52,304
I put the gift I
gave you to good use.

664
00:37:54,444 --> 00:37:57,136
My God, you're too much.

00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,761
This is nice, right?

I'm a traditional guy, so I
will ask this just one time.

678
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,590
I know it's silly, and I
won't ask this anymore.

679
00:39:11,625 --> 00:39:12,971
But I'm gonna do it.

00:39:33,129 --> 00:39:35,649
Well, Mr. Giancarlo,

683
00:39:41,482 --> 00:39:43,588
I am a traditional
woman as well,

684
00:39:43,622 --> 00:39:47,212
and I also think it's very
soon, but what the heck.

685
00:39:48,213 --> 00:39:49,007
Really?

686
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:50,042
Yes.

687
00:39:50,077 --> 00:39:51,492
You superhero, you.

688
00:39:52,769 --> 00:39:55,496
I don't know. I just did it
so you were more comfortable.

689
00:39:55,531 --> 00:39:56,497
Okay, I can give you
a superhero name.

690
00:39:56,532 --> 00:39:58,085
I don't want a superhero name.

691
00:39:58,119 --> 00:39:59,500
What about Super Burleska?

692
00:39:59,535 --> 00:40:00,881
Or Super Sex Dancer?

693
00:40:00,915 --> 00:40:01,813
Or Super Squeeze--

694
00:40:01,847 --> 00:40:03,228
Stop, no, please, no.

695
00:40:03,262 --> 00:40:05,126
You're ruining the moment.

696
00:40:05,161 --> 00:40:05,989
Okay.

697
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:08,889
Better.

698
00:40:12,099 --> 00:40:12,962
I'm gonna go now.

[soft piano music]

700
00:40:18,554 --> 00:40:19,831
I'm gonna close the door.

Okay.

702
00:40:20,694 --> 00:40:21,522
Okay?

00:40:22,454 --> 00:40:23,213

Natalie, please.

707
00:40:46,236 --> 00:40:48,307
Promise me that you're
going to behave.

708
00:40:48,342 --> 00:40:50,068
I promise.

709
00:40:50,102 --> 00:40:51,794
Why do you worry so much?

710
00:40:51,828 --> 00:40:53,934
Clearly, you like the guy, so.

711
00:40:55,556 --> 00:40:57,558
Why won't you tell me who it is?

712
00:40:57,593 --> 00:41:00,043
Well, you're gonna
meet him very soon, so.

713

[phone dinging]

714
00:41:08,535 --> 00:41:09,397
All right.

715
00:41:10,847 --> 00:41:12,055
Rocio picked up Natalie.

716
00:41:13,609 --> 00:41:14,817
Let's go.

717
00:41:14,851 --> 00:41:17,164
Okay. Hey, don't bring
up comics during dinner.

718
00:41:21,686 --> 00:41:22,687
Why?

719
00:41:22,721 --> 00:41:24,965
Natalie's gonna question
your level of maturity.

720
00:41:24,999 --> 00:41:26,449
Trust me.

721
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,830
She's gonna scrutinize your
every move and make sure

722
00:41:27,864 --> 00:41:30,211
you're the perfect candidate
for Rocio to marry.

723
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:32,420
Look, I don't wanna get married.

724
00:41:32,455 --> 00:41:34,250
I know. You're screwed.

725
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:36,528
And she definitely didn't
forget meeting you.

726
00:41:38,254 --> 00:41:40,049
I just needed to get
acquainted and meet her.

727
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:41,153
Come on, let's go.

728
00:41:42,085 --> 00:41:43,155
And no quotes.

729
00:41:44,881 --> 00:41:45,710
What else?

730
00:41:47,056 --> 00:41:48,644
You know what? Just don't talk.

731
00:41:52,026 --> 00:41:53,269
Of course.

732
00:41:53,303 --> 00:41:55,064
Hello, ladies, you
both look beautiful.

733
00:41:55,098 --> 00:41:56,548
[Rocio] Thank you.

734
00:41:56,583 --> 00:41:57,653
Hello, hello, hello.

735
00:41:58,654 --> 00:42:00,483
No, you?

736
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,449
Natalie.

737
00:42:01,484 --> 00:42:02,968
That's okay. That's okay.

738
00:42:05,074 --> 00:42:08,664
Natalie was right. I was
an a-hole at the party.

739
00:42:08,698 --> 00:42:10,424
Unintentionally, but it was.

740
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,564
Thank you.

741
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:14,566
But, let me ask you something.

742
00:42:14,601 --> 00:42:15,981
If you have a hole
in your pants,

743
00:42:16,016 --> 00:42:18,536
showing your panties
to everyone to see,

744
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:20,468
wouldn't you want
someone to tell you?

745
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,609
I think you like that.

746
00:42:23,782 --> 00:42:25,094
He does have a point.

747
00:42:25,128 --> 00:42:25,957
I know.

748
00:42:27,096 --> 00:42:27,890
Drinks?

749
00:42:27,924 --> 00:42:29,132
No, I'm off the clock.

750
00:42:29,167 --> 00:42:31,721
If you have a talent,
you should use--

751
00:42:31,756 --> 00:42:34,482
No no, no quotes, remember?

752
00:42:34,517 --> 00:42:35,656
That wasn't a quote.

753
00:42:35,691 --> 00:42:37,520
Oh please, Innertheans,
Issue Number Eight.

754
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,971
Mateo and Carter talking
about their superpowers.

755
00:42:42,249 --> 00:42:43,388
You need to get laid.

756
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,840
I do.

757
00:42:46,874 --> 00:42:48,496
You'll like him. You'll see.

758
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:51,707
Oh, and one more thing.

759
00:42:51,741 --> 00:42:53,605
No marriage topics
during dinner.

760
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,882
Why?

761
00:42:54,917 --> 00:42:58,437
Because he doesn't
believe in marriage.

762
00:42:58,472 --> 00:42:59,542
What?

763
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:00,647
Promise me, Natalie.

764
00:43:01,889 --> 00:43:04,236
Okay, fine, I'll try
to have a good time.

765
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:06,584
Even if I fake it.

766
00:43:07,446 --> 00:43:08,620
[all laughing]

767
00:43:08,655 --> 00:43:09,966
You're funny. That's
a good one.

768
00:43:10,001 --> 00:43:10,795
[laughing]

769
00:43:10,829 --> 00:43:12,141
So why don't you
wanna get married?

770
00:43:12,175 --> 00:43:13,211
Natalie!

771
00:43:13,245 --> 00:43:14,764
What?

772
00:43:14,799 --> 00:43:17,008
Giancarlo, you don't
need to answer that.

773
00:43:17,042 --> 00:43:19,907
No, no, if you want, we
could start a debate here.

774
00:43:19,942 --> 00:43:23,221
No! No, no, please. I don't
wanna hear anymore.

775
00:43:23,255 --> 00:43:25,672
Look, if you wanna talk about
Giancarlo's philosophical

776
00:43:25,706 --> 00:43:27,639
crap, you two can go
ahead and set a date.

777
00:43:27,674 --> 00:43:28,882
I'm with you.

778
00:43:28,916 --> 00:43:30,193
I mean, you're in?

779
00:43:30,228 --> 00:43:31,056
Yeah, deal.

780
00:43:31,954 --> 00:43:32,886
[clinking glasses]

781
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,404
I can't believe it.

782
00:43:34,439 --> 00:43:36,441
To be honest, I didn't think
you two were gonna get along.

783
00:43:36,475 --> 00:43:37,269
Why?

784
00:43:37,304 --> 00:43:39,375
Because you love
to judge everyone.

785
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:40,376
Not true.

786
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:41,791
-Yes you do.
-Yes you do.

787
00:43:41,826 --> 00:43:43,103
Okay, a little.

788
00:43:43,137 --> 00:43:46,658
Well, I'm glad you came with
an open mind to meet me.

789
00:43:46,693 --> 00:43:48,142
You're welcome.

790
00:43:48,177 --> 00:43:51,076
Attencion, attencion,
I'd like to make a toast.

791
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,150
I know both of you very
well, and I know your life

792
00:43:56,185 --> 00:44:00,016
ideologies are a tad bit
different, but seeing you guys

793
00:44:00,051 --> 00:44:05,056
together makes me very happy,
so to Mr. Yin and Mrs. Yang.

794
00:44:06,574 --> 00:44:08,646
-[Group] Salut.Cheers.
-[glasses clinking]

795
00:44:09,612 --> 00:44:10,509
Okay, my turn.

796
00:44:11,856 --> 00:44:13,927
[glass clinking]

797
00:44:13,961 --> 00:44:15,204
All right, but first a question.

798
00:44:15,238 --> 00:44:16,377
No questions.

799
00:44:16,412 --> 00:44:18,241
[speaking gibberish]

800
00:44:18,276 --> 00:44:21,969
Rocio, why do you
like Giancarlo?

801
00:44:22,004 --> 00:44:24,420
Yeah, why do you like
Giancarlo so much?

802
00:44:25,835 --> 00:44:26,905
Really?

803
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:30,806
-Well, um...
-[tender music]

804
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:33,601
I like that he's smart.

805
00:44:35,327 --> 00:44:37,019
And independent.

806
00:44:40,091 --> 00:44:41,437
And a gentleman.

807
00:44:44,716 --> 00:44:47,236
Those are good
qualities in any man.

808
00:44:49,307 --> 00:44:53,449
But, what I like most about him,

809
00:44:56,348 --> 00:44:58,903
is that he's honest.

810
00:45:02,078 --> 00:45:02,907
Whew. [chuckles nervously]

811
00:45:05,357 --> 00:45:07,705
And you know what
I like about you?

812
00:45:07,739 --> 00:45:10,708
You're smart, independent,

813
00:45:10,742 --> 00:45:13,711
strong and beautiful.

814
00:45:15,885 --> 00:45:18,543
If you can stare
into a person's eyes,

815
00:45:18,577 --> 00:45:20,579
you can look at their soul.

816
00:45:20,614 --> 00:45:22,305
And that soul is
made by the energy

817
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:24,342
that builds our universe.

818
00:45:24,376 --> 00:45:27,690
Meaning, if my soul can
connect with your soul,

819
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:30,141
our universes will collide.

820
00:45:30,175 --> 00:45:33,420
They will create an
energy so powerful

821
00:45:35,008 --> 00:45:37,010
that they can never be divided.

822
00:45:37,044 --> 00:45:39,909
Dude, stop reciting Kaon.

823
00:45:39,944 --> 00:45:41,014
What, that wasn't Kaon.

824
00:45:41,048 --> 00:45:43,326
Yes, it is, Issue Number Seven.

825
00:45:43,361 --> 00:45:46,295
Miguel, aka Kaon, tells
Lisa, his girlfriend,

826
00:45:46,329 --> 00:45:49,539
about his love for her, and
that's exactly what he says.

827
00:45:49,574 --> 00:45:51,093
Don't fall for it, Rocio.

828
00:45:51,127 --> 00:45:53,267
He's trying to use
plagiarism to woo you.

829
00:45:54,648 --> 00:45:56,201
[laughing]

830
00:45:56,236 --> 00:45:57,616
Oh my God, thank you so much

831
00:45:57,651 --> 00:45:59,998
for taking the time
to meet Giancarlo.

832
00:46:00,033 --> 00:46:02,967
It means a lot to
me, you know.

833
00:46:03,001 --> 00:46:05,521
You're so busy with your
wedding plans, I know.

834
00:46:05,555 --> 00:46:06,971
No, stop it.

835
00:46:07,005 --> 00:46:09,145
You're my best friend,
and I need to get to know

836
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:10,871
the man that you love.

837
00:46:14,392 --> 00:46:18,914
I think it's way too early
to talk about the L word.

838
00:46:20,018 --> 00:46:21,364
I do wanna say one thing.

839
00:46:22,503 --> 00:46:24,540
And I'm only saying
this because I love you.

840
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,475
I like Giancarlo. I do.

841
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:31,685
But if he doesn't
wanna get married,

842
00:46:31,719 --> 00:46:33,031
that's gonna be a problem.

843
00:46:35,413 --> 00:46:36,207
I know.

844
00:46:40,452 --> 00:46:41,522
Be smart, Rocio.

845
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:45,147
Ciao.

846
00:46:45,181 --> 00:46:46,389

What do you feel?

853
00:47:14,176 --> 00:47:16,143
It's beating fast.

854
00:47:16,178 --> 00:47:17,420

You know what? It's fine.

1084
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:56,187
I'll figure it out, like always.

1085
00:58:56,222 --> 00:58:56,912
-Hello?
-[phone beeps]

1086
00:58:57,568 --> 00:58:58,396
Hello?

1087
00:59:00,088 --> 00:59:02,090
[speaking foreign language]

1088
00:59:04,402 --> 00:59:05,852
[sighing]

1089
00:59:05,887 --> 00:59:08,545
[phone dinging]

1090
00:59:24,215 --> 00:59:25,838
What happened?

1091
00:59:25,872 --> 00:59:28,461
I went to the grocery store.
I need help with the bags.

1092
00:59:29,635 --> 00:59:31,291
Were you able to
do the transfer?

1093
00:59:32,361 --> 00:59:33,742
Like you care.

1094
00:59:33,777 --> 00:59:35,917
I do. I just didn't have time.

1095
00:59:35,951 --> 00:59:37,850
You know, the coding is
getting more complicated

1096
00:59:37,884 --> 00:59:38,989
than it should be.

1097
00:59:39,023 --> 00:59:40,300
I don't wanna discuss it.

1098
00:59:40,335 --> 00:59:42,786
I am tired, and I
don't wanna argue.

1099
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:45,133
You know, sometimes I feel,
Rocio, that working from home

1100
00:59:45,167 --> 00:59:47,618
from your point of view
is not really working.

1101
00:59:47,653 --> 00:59:49,378
For it means that I
have always extra time.

1102
00:59:49,413 --> 00:59:50,345
I never said that.

1103
00:59:50,379 --> 00:59:51,622
But you act like that.

1104
00:59:51,657 --> 00:59:52,968
Just tell me one time
that I ever called you

1105
00:59:53,003 --> 00:59:55,315
at your work to do
something for me, just one.

1106
00:59:56,696 --> 00:59:58,767
If you would ever
call me to my work

1107
00:59:58,802 --> 01:00:01,252
to do something for
you, I would do it.

1108
01:00:01,287 --> 01:00:02,978
The problem is that you
never wanna do anything

1109
01:00:03,013 --> 01:00:04,186
that doesn't relate with you.

1110
01:00:04,221 --> 01:00:06,361
Well it's not true,
because I'm always busy.

1111
01:00:06,395 --> 01:00:07,224
Always busy.

1112
01:00:10,227 --> 01:00:13,920
Why would you ask me why mom
called me the last minute, huh?

1113
01:00:14,783 --> 01:00:16,613
Like I know why she did it.

1114
01:00:16,647 --> 01:00:17,993
I don't know, okay.

1115
01:00:18,028 --> 01:00:20,720
All I know is I'm her
daughter. She needed the money.

1116
01:00:20,755 --> 01:00:23,861
And I ask you for help.
You're my boyfriend, okay.

1117
01:00:23,896 --> 01:00:25,138
The person that I live with.

1118
01:00:25,173 --> 01:00:26,484
You're supposed to
be there for me.

1119
01:00:26,519 --> 01:00:28,694
If I ask something from
you, you should do it.

1120
01:00:28,728 --> 01:00:29,660
End of discussion.

1121
01:00:29,695 --> 01:00:31,041
What? Not end of discussion.

1122
01:00:31,075 --> 01:00:31,973
What are you talking about?

1123
01:00:32,007 --> 01:00:33,250
Because if my job is affected,

1124
01:00:33,284 --> 01:00:34,596
who's going to help me
to pay my bills, huh?

1125
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,667
Your mom? Oh, I don't think so.

1126
01:00:36,702 --> 01:00:38,151
I love your mom. You know I do.

1127
01:00:38,186 --> 01:00:39,981
But she needs to leave
her pride at the door

1128
01:00:40,015 --> 01:00:41,741
and ask for help with time.

1129
01:00:41,776 --> 01:00:43,605
Everybody works
in different ways.

1130
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,951
You need to understand that.

1131
01:00:44,986 --> 01:00:46,953
I do understand when
her poor decisions

1132
01:00:46,988 --> 01:00:48,783
are affecting other people.

1133
01:00:48,817 --> 01:00:51,889
[gasps] You prick.

1134
01:00:53,788 --> 01:00:55,306
I'm not saying it like that.

1135
01:00:55,341 --> 01:00:59,000
I'm just, I want her to be
more organized. That's all.

1136
01:00:59,034 --> 01:01:02,659
Who are you to tell her
what to do and how to do it?

1137
01:01:03,970 --> 01:01:06,007
What she does and
how she does it

1138
01:01:06,041 --> 01:01:07,905
is up to her, not to you.

1139
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:09,148
Oh yeah?

1140
01:01:09,182 --> 01:01:10,632
Don't you think it would
be better if she tell you

1141
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,151
at least one week before
the payment was up?

1142
01:01:12,185 --> 01:01:14,360
Yeah, yeah, it would
have been better.

1143
01:01:14,394 --> 01:01:17,087
But it didn't happen
that way. Deal with it.

1144
01:01:18,295 --> 01:01:20,228
You know, it's nine PM,
you just came from work.

1145
01:01:20,262 --> 01:01:21,850
I'm still working on the app.

1146
01:01:22,851 --> 01:01:24,335
We're very busy people, Rocio.

1147
01:01:24,370 --> 01:01:27,304
I just want her to ask us
with more time, that's all.

1148
01:01:28,615 --> 01:01:29,755
Busy people?

1149
01:01:31,757 --> 01:01:32,965
Let me show you busy.

1150
01:01:34,414 --> 01:01:36,140
What are you doing?

1151
01:01:40,766 --> 01:01:41,559
Let's see.

1152
01:01:42,595 --> 01:01:44,217
Barbecue with friends.

1153
01:01:46,564 --> 01:01:47,911
Natalie's wedding.

1154
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:51,362
My mom's birthday.

1155
01:01:52,398 --> 01:01:53,710
The river trip.

1156
01:01:55,125 --> 01:01:57,334
Where are you in all
these pictures, Giancarlo?

1157
01:01:59,267 --> 01:02:00,544
Nowhere.

1158
01:02:00,578 --> 01:02:04,065
This is not about
being busy or not.

1159
01:02:04,099 --> 01:02:06,481
This is about you
not wanting anything

1160
01:02:06,515 --> 01:02:09,277
to interfere with your life.

1161
01:02:09,311 --> 01:02:11,417
And anything that
doesn't interest you,

1162
01:02:11,451 --> 01:02:12,867
you just don't care.

1163
01:02:12,901 --> 01:02:14,420
Even if I do.

1164
01:02:15,801 --> 01:02:18,562
You don't live alone
anymore. You live with me.

1165
01:02:18,596 --> 01:02:20,598
And that alone would
alter your little

1166
01:02:20,633 --> 01:02:22,255
bubble of self-indulgence.

1167
01:02:22,290 --> 01:02:23,498
Really?

1168
01:02:23,532 --> 01:02:24,706
I never pushed anything
on you that you didn't

1169
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:27,226
wanna do or go to, did I, ever?

1170
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:29,987
But you still do it, don't you?

1171
01:02:30,022 --> 01:02:32,024
With me or without me.

1172
01:02:33,335 --> 01:02:36,235
Do you think I wanted to go
to that stupid LA convention?

1173
01:02:38,202 --> 01:02:40,204
No, of course I didn't.

1174
01:02:40,239 --> 01:02:43,000
But I did it because I love you.

1175
01:02:43,035 --> 01:02:46,486
Because I wanna see that
part of your world with you.

1176
01:02:47,902 --> 01:02:50,490
You don't wanna see anybody
else's world, just yours.

1177
01:02:51,802 --> 01:02:55,841
You know who does that?
A selfish son of a bitch.

1178
01:03:00,535 --> 01:03:02,813
It wasn't a stupid
convention. You know that.

1179
01:03:04,988 --> 01:03:05,851
It was awesome.

1180
01:03:10,062 --> 01:03:10,890
Shit.

1181
01:03:34,741 --> 01:03:35,570
Rocio?

1182
01:03:37,261 --> 01:03:38,745
I need to go to work.

1183
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:40,782
Today we close a
deal for Howard.

1184
01:03:42,163 --> 01:03:45,752
I am sorry. I wanna
be there for you.

1185
01:03:49,204 --> 01:03:52,829
Listen, Giancarlo, I know
the transition is hard.

1186
01:03:53,933 --> 01:03:56,211
But when two people
live together,

1187
01:03:56,246 --> 01:03:57,626
there's going to be compromises.

1188
01:03:57,661 --> 01:03:58,835
There's no other way.

1189
01:04:00,353 --> 01:04:01,182
You're right.

1190
01:04:03,391 --> 01:04:04,288
I love you.

1191
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:08,258
I know.

1192
01:04:08,292 --> 01:04:09,638
I love you too.

1193
01:04:12,193 --> 01:04:13,642
Did you finish the app?

1194
01:04:13,677 --> 01:04:15,990
Yeah. Sent it this morning
before going to sleep.

1195
01:04:16,922 --> 01:04:18,095
When was that?

1196
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:20,995
Four AM. But I'm sure
they'll be pleased.

1197
01:04:22,030 --> 01:04:22,859
Me too.

1198
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:26,448
You know,

1199
01:04:29,693 --> 01:04:33,662
it's hard for me to get
used to you working at home.

1200
01:04:35,147 --> 01:04:38,909
I feel like you're
wasting time, but,

1201
01:04:40,393 --> 01:04:42,844
but I need to understand
that that's the way you work.

1202
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:44,018
I need to respect that.

1203
01:04:45,951 --> 01:04:49,023
[piano music]

1204
01:04:49,057 --> 01:04:50,610
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1205
01:04:50,645 --> 01:04:51,473
What?

1206
01:04:53,406 --> 01:04:55,270
Really? Let's do one more.

1207
01:04:55,305 --> 01:04:56,582
No, because then, if
we need to go back,

1208
01:04:56,616 --> 01:04:58,756
that'll be three hours and.

1209
01:05:00,103 --> 01:05:01,690
We can jump rope at
home. That'd be more fun.

1210
01:05:01,725 --> 01:05:03,140
You get bored too easily.

1211
01:05:03,175 --> 01:05:05,694
I'm not bored. I'm with you.

1212
01:05:05,729 --> 01:05:06,557
Bite me.

1213
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:13,461
I love working out around
these beautiful houses.

1214
01:05:15,773 --> 01:05:16,602
Yeah.

1215
01:05:17,983 --> 01:05:22,056
Actually, I was
thinking to buy a house.

1216
01:05:24,161 --> 01:05:25,991
You wanna buy a house now?

1217
01:05:26,025 --> 01:05:28,027
Yeah, with you.

1218
01:05:30,754 --> 01:05:32,411
Oh, well.

1219
01:05:33,722 --> 01:05:35,172
I don't know.

1220
01:05:35,207 --> 01:05:38,106
I was thinking to save at
least for one more year.

1221
01:05:38,141 --> 01:05:39,211
I mean, we've been
living together

1222
01:05:39,245 --> 01:05:41,558
for almost a year now.

1223
01:05:41,592 --> 01:05:44,699
You've saved a lot of
money, plus my money.

1224
01:05:44,733 --> 01:05:45,700
It would be enough.

1225
01:05:46,597 --> 01:05:48,703
I don't know. Besides--

1226
01:05:49,531 --> 01:05:51,085
Besides what?

1227
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:55,330
Our relationship. I don't
think it's mature enough.

1228
01:05:55,365 --> 01:05:57,608
I mean, a serious
couple should have

1229
01:05:57,643 --> 01:06:00,197
at least one shared
bank account.

1230
01:06:00,232 --> 01:06:03,580
And if we buy a house
without being married

1231
01:06:03,614 --> 01:06:06,479
we won't have the same
legal protections.

1232
01:06:06,514 --> 01:06:08,861
We will have to
buy it as a couple.

1233
01:06:08,895 --> 01:06:12,278
Yeah, so that's what we
are. We're just a couple.

1234
01:06:12,313 --> 01:06:15,212
You know, we sign the
title as tenants in common.

1235
01:06:15,247 --> 01:06:19,044
We just co-own the
house, both of us.

1236
01:06:19,078 --> 01:06:20,631
Come on, it's not complicated.

1237
01:06:20,666 --> 01:06:23,600
We just pay half the mortgage,
half of the down payment.

1238
01:06:23,634 --> 01:06:25,878
We both co-own the house.

1239
01:06:25,912 --> 01:06:26,741
It's simple.

1240
01:06:31,435 --> 01:06:35,163
I don't know. Let
me think about it.

1241
01:06:35,198 --> 01:06:40,099
We'll just buy some food,
and we can talk about it.

1242
01:06:40,134 --> 01:06:42,999
[traffic passing]

1243
01:07:01,086 --> 01:07:02,328
Are you okay?

1244
01:07:04,123 --> 01:07:04,951
I'm okay.

1245
01:07:04,986 --> 01:07:06,574
[Phone voice] False.

1246
01:07:06,608 --> 01:07:07,471
What's that?

1247
01:07:07,506 --> 01:07:09,232
That's Mentira.

1248
01:07:09,266 --> 01:07:12,476
I'm testing it, and it looks
like it's working perfectly.

1249
01:07:14,892 --> 01:07:16,342
What's going on?

1250
01:07:16,377 --> 01:07:18,862
If we're gonna make the
decision of buying a house

1251
01:07:18,896 --> 01:07:22,590
together, we're gonna
make it inside the circle.

1252
01:07:22,624 --> 01:07:23,901
I mean, we can use Mentira.

1253
01:07:26,283 --> 01:07:27,698
We're doing it old school.

1254
01:07:35,499 --> 01:07:36,707
Speak with your heart.

1255
01:07:38,330 --> 01:07:39,745
Okay, okay.

1256
01:07:41,091 --> 01:07:43,507
Do you wanna buy
a house with me?

1257
01:07:43,542 --> 01:07:44,612
Yeah.

1258
01:07:44,646 --> 01:07:45,475
[Phone voice] True.

1259
01:07:55,761 --> 01:07:57,728
Do you think that
buying a house with me

1260
01:07:57,763 --> 01:08:00,110
is a step forward
in our relationship?

1261
01:08:00,145 --> 01:08:01,422
Of course.

1262
01:08:01,456 --> 01:08:02,388
How?

1263
01:08:02,423 --> 01:08:04,149
We are already living together,

1264
01:08:04,183 --> 01:08:07,013
and we're sharing expenses
and responsibilities.

1265
01:08:08,153 --> 01:08:09,947
This one would be a bigger one,

1266
01:08:09,982 --> 01:08:12,191
like more commitment
to the relationship.

1267
01:08:13,123 --> 01:08:16,953
Plus, it'd be our first
investment as a couple.

1268
01:08:18,163 --> 01:08:19,129
That's big.

1269
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:21,304
Equal parts?

1270
01:08:21,337 --> 01:08:22,649
Yeah.

1271
01:08:22,684 --> 01:08:23,513
Okay.

1272
01:08:25,584 --> 01:08:26,447
It's my turn now.

1273
01:08:36,422 --> 01:08:38,183
[phone ticking]

1274
01:08:40,425 --> 01:08:43,671
What do you want?

1275
01:08:43,705 --> 01:08:46,260
I wanna buy a house, and

1276
01:08:47,468 --> 01:08:49,849
I do wanna buy a house with you.

1277
01:08:49,884 --> 01:08:50,711
[Phone voice] True.

1278
01:08:57,547 --> 01:09:00,514
But I don't wanna
buy it like this.

1279
01:09:00,550 --> 01:09:01,378
[Phone voice] True.

1280
01:09:05,210 --> 01:09:07,833
It sounds more like a
business proposition

1281
01:09:07,867 --> 01:09:11,871
than a couple moving forward
with their relationship.

1282
01:09:13,907 --> 01:09:16,979
Most couples buy a house
because they're married

1283
01:09:17,014 --> 01:09:19,741
or they plan to do so.

1284
01:09:19,776 --> 01:09:23,124
Because they're gonna build
a future in that house.

1285
01:09:24,505 --> 01:09:26,471
But you don't
believe in marriage.

1286
01:09:26,506 --> 01:09:29,958
And I respect that, but
I don't wanna buy a house

1287
01:09:29,993 --> 01:09:33,824
for equity or to
diversify my money.

1288
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:37,551
If I was to buy
a house with you,

1289
01:09:39,589 --> 01:09:44,387
it would be because we're
gonna fill it with love

1290
01:09:45,559 --> 01:09:48,839
and a family and
a future together.

1291
01:09:53,499 --> 01:09:54,431
I love you.

1292
01:09:56,157 --> 01:09:57,123
I really do.

1293
01:10:00,023 --> 01:10:04,165
Maybe it's, it's like you say.

1294
01:10:08,790 --> 01:10:10,585
Love is not enough.

1295
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:11,897
[Phone voice] True.

1296
01:10:15,245 --> 01:10:17,316
I don't wanna buy
a house with you.

1297
01:10:21,493 --> 01:10:23,460
At least not right now.

1298
01:10:23,495 --> 01:10:24,323
[Phone voice] True.

1299
01:10:25,393 --> 01:10:26,222
So when?

1300
01:10:29,052 --> 01:10:30,571
When would be the right moment?

1301
01:10:32,434 --> 01:10:34,091
Feels like never.

1302
01:10:34,126 --> 01:10:37,025
[soft piano music]

1303
01:11:00,428 --> 01:11:03,017
[bird calling]

1304
01:11:04,121 --> 01:11:06,916
[soft piano music]

1305
01:11:27,144 --> 01:11:28,525
Where were you?

1306
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:31,632
I've been calling you all day.

1307
01:11:37,776 --> 01:11:38,777
We need to talk.

1308
01:11:41,124 --> 01:11:41,952
Talk.

1309
01:11:45,541 --> 01:11:47,337
I've been thinking
a lot about us.

1310
01:11:50,375 --> 01:11:51,859
About our relationship.

1311
01:11:57,485 --> 01:12:00,350
Giancarlo, the love
I feel for you,

1312
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:04,353
I never felt before.

1313
01:12:10,395 --> 01:12:12,327
But I'm just realizing that

1314
01:12:14,639 --> 01:12:17,850
you are never gonna give
me the life I dreamed of.

1315
01:12:20,474 --> 01:12:21,785
I don't understand why.

1316
01:12:24,892 --> 01:12:26,652
We can buy the
house that you want.

1317
01:12:28,205 --> 01:12:31,898
We can fill it with
children, love,

1318
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:34,142
A cat.

1319
01:12:35,627 --> 01:12:37,249
Everything that you want.

1320
01:12:38,802 --> 01:12:41,909
We can occupy the same
space as a married couple,

1321
01:12:43,013 --> 01:12:46,568
with the same feelings,
the same feelings.

1322
01:12:48,847 --> 01:12:50,780
We just don't have
that contract.

1323
01:12:52,644 --> 01:12:55,267
It's not just the contract.

1324
01:12:56,993 --> 01:12:59,960
It's what the
contract represents.

1325
01:13:01,998 --> 01:13:05,967
It's the wedding, the dress.

1326
01:13:06,002 --> 01:13:08,522
It's saying in front of
everybody that we know

1327
01:13:08,556 --> 01:13:10,213
that we love each other.

1328
01:13:10,246 --> 01:13:13,665
It's saying before God that
we will take care of us

1329
01:13:13,699 --> 01:13:16,875
till death tear us apart.

1330
01:13:16,909 --> 01:13:18,255
But what's the difference?

1331
01:13:18,290 --> 01:13:21,500
I can buy a huge thing
saying I love you.

1332
01:13:21,535 --> 01:13:24,952
I can say it on the radio,
tell God that I love you.

1333
01:13:26,746 --> 01:13:29,957
The commitment I have
for you needs no paper.

1334
01:13:31,855 --> 01:13:35,411
No paper, the commitment
is my love for you.

1335
01:13:39,068 --> 01:13:41,106
And I wanna live by
your side forever.

1336
01:13:42,934 --> 01:13:45,628
Not even death will
break us apart.

1337
01:13:52,219 --> 01:13:53,601
What if we have kids?

1338
01:13:55,050 --> 01:13:56,570
What are we gonna tell them?

1339
01:13:56,603 --> 01:13:58,019
What?

1340
01:13:58,054 --> 01:13:59,227
That we're not married?

1341
01:14:01,609 --> 01:14:04,335
You know how many kids grow
up without a dad or a mom?

1342
01:14:05,682 --> 01:14:08,340
Every family is different.

1343
01:14:08,374 --> 01:14:10,480
You're just stuck with the
ritual that you grew up with,

1344
01:14:10,514 --> 01:14:12,137
and you can't get it
out of your system.

1345
01:14:12,171 --> 01:14:13,241
Stop with the ritual please.

1346
01:14:13,276 --> 01:14:14,588
But it's true, Rocio.

1347
01:14:16,348 --> 01:14:18,454
It's not about that.

1348
01:14:19,351 --> 01:14:21,041
Can't you see?

1349
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:24,183
It's about us.

1350
01:14:27,152 --> 01:14:28,429
We want different things.

1351
01:14:29,568 --> 01:14:32,191
You don't even want
a shared account.

1352
01:14:37,645 --> 01:14:40,406
You love dogs. I love cats.

1353
01:14:40,441 --> 01:14:42,684
You work from home.
I work at the office.

1354
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:47,724
I love being around people,
and you love your solitude.

1355
01:14:49,174 --> 01:14:51,866
Can you still tell me that
our differences are nothing?

1356
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,731
That they're insignificant?

1357
01:14:57,941 --> 01:15:02,359
And you, Mr. "I
Don't Give a Shit."

1358
01:15:02,394 --> 01:15:05,949
Mr. "I Am the Smartest
Person on Planet Earth,"

1359
01:15:05,984 --> 01:15:09,366
and I cannot get bothered by
the pettiness of us mortals.

1360
01:15:09,401 --> 01:15:10,816
What are you talking about?

1361
01:15:11,782 --> 01:15:13,992
You're so full of shit.

1362
01:15:14,026 --> 01:15:15,925
I'm the one full of shit?

1363
01:15:15,959 --> 01:15:19,860
I'm the one that lives like
everybody else on Planet Earth?

1364
01:15:20,826 --> 01:15:22,897
Because if you're not happy,

1365
01:15:24,071 --> 01:15:25,624
I want a husband,
I want a house,

1366
01:15:25,659 --> 01:15:28,385
I want, I want, I want, I want.

1367
01:15:29,421 --> 01:15:31,285
That's what you said, I want.

1368
01:15:35,151 --> 01:15:36,117
Fuck you.

1369
01:15:36,152 --> 01:15:36,980
Fuck me.

1370
01:15:38,223 --> 01:15:40,674
You don't want that many things.

1371
01:15:40,708 --> 01:15:44,781
You just are,
Rocio, you just are.

1372
01:15:44,816 --> 01:15:45,644
You're right.

1373
01:15:48,785 --> 01:15:50,442
But I can't just be.

1374
01:15:52,582 --> 01:15:55,723
Because you, you're the only one

1375
01:15:55,758 --> 01:15:59,244
in between me and
my happy future.

1376
01:15:59,278 --> 01:16:03,179
Hm.

1377
01:16:03,213 --> 01:16:06,596
This relationship, it's like
a high school relationship,

1378
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:09,116
just fucking without a plan.

1379
01:16:09,150 --> 01:16:10,807
So much education for what?

1380
01:16:10,842 --> 01:16:12,395
Don't bring my education.

1381
01:16:12,429 --> 01:16:13,879
Yes, why?

1382
01:16:13,914 --> 01:16:16,364
Because you can't comprehend
the simplicity of things.

1383
01:16:16,398 --> 01:16:17,642
You just don't see.

1384
01:16:19,954 --> 01:16:23,094
Your simplicity,
it's on your favor.

1385
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:26,789
I am not a girl anymore.

1386
01:16:27,962 --> 01:16:30,309
You are wasting my time.

1387
01:16:30,344 --> 01:16:32,311
Really? What about mytime?

1388
01:16:32,346 --> 01:16:34,003
What about yourtime?

1389
01:16:34,037 --> 01:16:36,799
You already have the
life that you dream.

1390
01:16:38,214 --> 01:16:42,943
You work from home. You
have your comic shit hobby.

1391
01:16:42,977 --> 01:16:44,978
You are fucking me.

1392
01:16:45,014 --> 01:16:47,706
You can retire tomorrow
if you would like to.

1393
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:51,330
Your simplicity
is in your favor.

1394
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:58,614
No. My simplicity
is in ourfavor.

1395
01:16:59,718 --> 01:17:01,202
Because my simplicity is you.

1396
01:17:02,963 --> 01:17:04,620
You are my simple life.

1397
01:17:07,657 --> 01:17:08,762
Because I love you.

1398
01:17:11,316 --> 01:17:12,938
But like I said before, no?

1399
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:19,496
Love is not enough for you,
and it will never be enough.

[soft piano music]

1401
01:17:25,192 --> 01:17:29,023
You're right. It's not enough.

1402
01:17:30,715 --> 01:17:35,202
Because love, it's
surrounded by real life.

1403
01:17:36,513 --> 01:17:39,758
But you, you don't
wanna live on it.

[Rocio] Natalie?

01:18:01,021 --> 01:18:03,023
I'm in the bedroom!

1410
01:18:03,057 --> 01:18:04,782
Come through the back door!

1411
01:18:10,755 --> 01:18:11,825
What are you doing?

1412
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:15,587
Really?

1413
01:18:15,621 --> 01:18:18,383
Maybe, I don't know.

1414
01:18:18,416 --> 01:18:20,178
We'll find out in
a couple minutes.

1415
01:18:24,423 --> 01:18:26,563
Oh yeah, I love being a writer.

1416
01:18:27,737 --> 01:18:30,084
And now that I'm being
nominated for an Eisner,

1417
01:18:30,119 --> 01:18:32,466
-I should get a higher rate.
-[Phone voice] False.

1418
01:18:34,088 --> 01:18:34,882
Hold on.

1419
01:18:34,916 --> 01:18:36,434
Oh shit, aw.

1420
01:18:36,469 --> 01:18:40,888
Dude. Dude, what the fuck?

1421
01:18:40,923 --> 01:18:42,096
What was that?

1422
01:18:42,130 --> 01:18:43,753
That's Mentira,fuck, it
smells in here.

1423
01:18:43,788 --> 01:18:46,480
Well it's the goddam bacchanal
you gave me the other day.

1424
01:18:46,514 --> 01:18:47,412
Shut the door.

1425
01:18:49,552 --> 01:18:52,762
Remember when I told
you that I was fine

1426
01:18:52,797 --> 01:18:55,523
with us wanting
different things in life?

1427
01:18:55,558 --> 01:18:56,800
Mm-hm, yeah.

1428
01:18:57,974 --> 01:19:01,909
The reality is that,
I'm not fine with it.

1429
01:19:03,462 --> 01:19:04,843
At all.

1430
01:19:04,878 --> 01:19:08,882
And the more time that
pass, the more I realize it.

1431
01:19:09,606 --> 01:19:11,228
Where were we?

1432
01:19:11,263 --> 01:19:13,507
Hold on. Dude, what the--?

1433
01:19:13,541 --> 01:19:15,335
Just tuck it in, man, so
the smell doesn't come out.

1434
01:19:15,371 --> 01:19:17,235
Okay, can you just wait?

1435
01:19:17,269 --> 01:19:19,030
I need to talk to you now.
Put the phone on mute.

1436
01:19:19,064 --> 01:19:19,858
Just tuck it in.

1437
01:19:19,893 --> 01:19:20,825
It is on mute.

1438
01:19:22,343 --> 01:19:24,068
You know, I hate
being interrupted

1439
01:19:24,103 --> 01:19:25,208
when I'm taking a shit.

1440
01:19:25,243 --> 01:19:27,555
I'm desperate [speaks
foreign language].

1441
01:19:27,797 --> 01:19:29,557
Okay, what's going on?

1442
01:19:29,592 --> 01:19:31,525
But I thought he
wanted a family too?

1443
01:19:32,112 --> 01:19:33,182
Yes.

1444
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:37,876
But he doesn't want
it the same way I do.

1445
01:19:37,911 --> 01:19:40,603
I don't know why,
but getting married

1446
01:19:42,018 --> 01:19:46,540
and starting a family, it's
the biggest dream of my life.

1447
01:19:46,989 --> 01:19:49,992
And make it quick, this
is a comic book artist.

1448
01:19:50,026 --> 01:19:52,235
I don't know what I'm
gonna do, you know.

1449
01:19:52,270 --> 01:19:53,409
I don't wanna lose her.

1450
01:19:56,308 --> 01:19:58,379
Okay, let me tell you something.

1451
01:19:58,414 --> 01:20:01,072
Marriage is way overrated.

1452
01:20:01,106 --> 01:20:03,384
And at the beginning,
it was great.

1453
01:20:04,903 --> 01:20:06,284
But now...

1454
01:20:07,837 --> 01:20:10,046
[sighs] not so much.

1455
01:20:10,081 --> 01:20:11,599
Would you rather be single then?

1456
01:20:11,634 --> 01:20:14,499
Oh no. No, no, no, honey.

1457
01:20:14,532 --> 01:20:17,571
Single, me? At my age,
that would just be weird.

1458
01:20:20,056 --> 01:20:21,886
Are you crying?

1459
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:23,611
What? I'm not crying.

1460
01:20:23,646 --> 01:20:25,648
It's the shit.

1461
01:20:25,682 --> 01:20:28,271
I don't know. It looks
like you wanna cry.

1462
01:20:30,584 --> 01:20:33,242
Huh, this is very interesting.

1463
01:20:34,621 --> 01:20:37,902
And for the first time,
Giancarlo Panetta is confused,

1464
01:20:37,936 --> 01:20:40,559
completely clueless
about what to do.

1465
01:20:40,594 --> 01:20:43,630
I'm never, ever, not
gonna be married.

1466
01:20:43,666 --> 01:20:47,083
It's just, I need that
peace of mind, you know.

1467
01:20:48,532 --> 01:20:51,950
I'm married, and I like
how it sounds. I'm married.

1468
01:20:52,986 --> 01:20:54,193
You know, I ...

1469
01:20:56,610 --> 01:20:58,681
Okay, you know what
you do every time I go

1470
01:20:58,715 --> 01:20:59,924
to ask you for advice?

1471
01:20:59,958 --> 01:21:01,166
This is what you tell me.

1472
01:21:02,478 --> 01:21:06,550
[imitating] Don't worry,
everything's gonna be okay.

1473
01:21:08,794 --> 01:21:10,382
You need to grow up.

1474
01:21:12,143 --> 01:21:13,903
Well you know what,
as your hombre,

1475
01:21:13,938 --> 01:21:16,318
you need to stop being
a baby and grow up.

1476
01:21:16,353 --> 01:21:17,493
What do you want?

1477
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:22,878
I'm pregnant!

1478
01:21:25,777 --> 01:21:27,986
Congratulations.

1479
01:21:28,021 --> 01:21:29,712
I'm gonna be a mommy.

1480
01:21:29,746 --> 01:21:31,162
I wanna be a mommy too.

1481
01:21:32,232 --> 01:21:33,889
Oh you will be.

1482
01:21:33,923 --> 01:21:36,029
Just don't wait too long,
because we're getting old.

1483
01:21:36,063 --> 01:21:38,928
I mean, in 10 years we'll
be middle-aged women.

1484
01:21:38,963 --> 01:21:39,825
What?

1485
01:21:41,034 --> 01:21:41,897
Oh.

1486
01:21:43,139 --> 01:21:44,934
Oh, come here.

1487
01:21:44,969 --> 01:21:47,661
Oh, honey.

1488
01:21:47,695 --> 01:21:49,249
I'm so happy for you.

1489
01:21:49,282 --> 01:21:50,629
Aw, thank you.

1490
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:54,150
Congratulations.

1491
01:21:58,430 --> 01:22:00,329
So what do you really want?

1492
01:22:00,362 --> 01:22:01,537
Because you know what
I want is for you

1493
01:22:01,571 --> 01:22:02,745
to get out of my bathroom.

1494
01:22:02,779 --> 01:22:04,264
This is when the
king uses his throne,

1495
01:22:04,298 --> 01:22:06,438
and what the king wants
is what the king wants.

1496
01:22:06,473 --> 01:22:07,300
El Campion.

1497
01:22:08,337 --> 01:22:09,165
Sorry.

1498
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:14,964
You know what? Your version
of me is actually right.

1499
01:22:14,999 --> 01:22:16,068
And you know why
I always tell you

1500
01:22:16,103 --> 01:22:17,553
the same crap all the time?

1501
01:22:18,726 --> 01:22:20,245
Because the moment
you stop lying,

1502
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:22,730
you will find the person
you've been looking for.

1503
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:26,527
[gentle music]

1504
01:22:27,735 --> 01:22:28,564
Yeah.

1505
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:32,016
[Justin] Hey, sorry.

1506
01:22:33,189 --> 01:22:35,916
Listen, I have to
tell you something.

1507
01:22:37,021 --> 01:22:40,023
I actually never got
nominated for an Eisner.

1508
01:22:40,058 --> 01:22:40,921
[Phone voice] True.

1509
01:22:50,931 --> 01:22:53,865
[soft piano music]

1510
01:23:41,326 --> 01:23:42,396

[crickets chirping]

1513
01:23:49,610 --> 01:23:52,544
[soft piano music]

1514
01:23:54,098 --> 01:23:56,202
I know we want different
things in life,

1515
01:23:58,481 --> 01:24:01,484
and I feel we're growing
further from each other,

1516
01:24:01,519 --> 01:24:03,452
but I want to keep
that from happening.

1517
01:24:04,728 --> 01:24:07,076
My feelings for you are too
strong to let that happen.

1518
01:24:08,250 --> 01:24:12,047
The bond of love is too
powerful to be broken.

1519
01:24:13,702 --> 01:24:14,532
Kaon?

1520
01:24:18,432 --> 01:24:19,088
Me.

1521
01:24:19,675 --> 01:24:22,574
[soft piano music]

1522
01:24:24,541 --> 01:24:27,545
[crickets chirping]

1523
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:35,794
Rocio Hernandez,
will you marry me?

1524
01:24:35,829 --> 01:24:38,728
[soft piano music]

1525
01:24:56,712 --> 01:25:01,130
I love you, but you're
just doing this for me.

1526
01:25:03,028 --> 01:25:06,239
I'm doing this for both of us.

1527
01:25:06,273 --> 01:25:09,068
We're in the circle of honesty.

1528
01:25:10,174 --> 01:25:12,555
Look me in the eye,
and tell me that...

1529
01:25:14,350 --> 01:25:15,558
you believe in marriage.

1530
01:25:18,077 --> 01:25:22,393
I believe what marriage
represents and stands for.

1531
01:25:22,427 --> 01:25:25,430
[crickets chirping]

1532
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:32,023
But, I don't believe in
marriage the same way you do.

1533
01:25:35,785 --> 01:25:38,340
I can't marry you, Giancarlo.

1534
01:25:42,516 --> 01:25:43,309
I'm sorry.

1535
01:25:46,657 --> 01:25:47,934
For both of us.

1536
01:25:52,388 --> 01:25:55,288
[soft piano music]

1537
01:26:21,452 --> 01:26:22,280
Rocio?

1538
01:26:27,285 --> 01:26:30,978
[speaking foreign language]

1539
01:26:33,671 --> 01:26:35,880
You look as beautiful as always.

1540
01:26:36,812 --> 01:26:40,919
And you look beautiful as well.

1541
01:26:42,231 --> 01:26:45,303
No. No, no, no, don't hide
it. Let me see this.

1542
01:26:45,510 --> 01:26:47,340
Oh, the ring looks beautiful.

1543
01:26:50,929 --> 01:26:51,930
What about you?

1544
01:26:54,830 --> 01:26:56,003
Are you seeing someone?

1545
01:26:58,385 --> 01:26:59,523
Why do I even ask?

1546
01:27:02,251 --> 01:27:03,356
You are who you are.

1547
01:27:05,116 --> 01:27:06,807
And you are who you are,

1548
01:27:06,842 --> 01:27:10,017
and you are, glowing.

1549
01:27:11,502 --> 01:27:13,745
Did you get him
inside the circle?

1550
01:27:13,780 --> 01:27:17,646
No, he said it was
a child's game,

1551
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:19,820
and because it
comes from you, so.

1552
01:27:23,962 --> 01:27:25,964
I'm happy for you. I really am.

1553
01:27:29,071 --> 01:27:32,868
I wish you a...beautiful life.

1554
01:27:34,076 --> 01:27:34,904
Thanks.

1555
01:27:36,251 --> 01:27:37,079
I do too.

1556
01:27:42,567 --> 01:27:43,465
I gotta go.

1557
01:27:50,126 --> 01:27:51,921
Love never dies.

1558
01:27:51,956 --> 01:27:54,441
It transforms. It evolves.

1559
01:27:56,616 --> 01:27:58,273
But it will always be love.

1560
01:27:58,307 --> 01:27:59,135
Kaon?

1561
01:28:04,416 --> 01:28:05,314
I love you.

1562
01:28:07,799 --> 01:28:09,145
I love you too.

1563
01:28:09,180 --> 01:28:12,942
[gentle piano music]

1564
01:28:12,977 --> 01:28:15,635
[birds singing]

1565
01:28:19,432 --> 01:28:20,433
Bye.

1566
01:28:21,123 --> 01:28:21,916
Bye.

[gentle piano music]

1568
01:28:38,243 --> 01:28:39,175
You okay?

1569
01:28:40,073 --> 01:28:42,282
You've been quiet all day.

1570
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:43,214
I'm fine.

1571
01:28:47,011 --> 01:28:49,462
This is the day that
I've been waiting for

1572
01:28:49,496 --> 01:28:50,911
my whole life, right?

1573
01:28:50,946 --> 01:28:54,225
Yes, it's so exciting.
It's your dream.

1574
01:28:55,606 --> 01:28:58,193
It's gonna be a
beautiful, beautiful day.

1575
01:28:58,228 --> 01:28:59,368
And...

1576
01:28:59,403 --> 01:29:02,198
...my God, you look
absolutely gorgeous.

1577
01:29:03,371 --> 01:29:05,650
I can't wait to see you
walk down that aisle.

1578
01:29:06,513 --> 01:29:08,343
You're gonna be married today.

1579
01:29:09,413 --> 01:29:10,724
Oh, you look so pretty.

1580
01:29:10,759 --> 01:29:11,587
It's your day.

1581
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:14,693
Hold on.

1582
01:29:17,386 --> 01:29:19,250
Are you sure you're okay?

1583
01:29:19,284 --> 01:29:20,112
Yeah.

1584
01:29:25,049 --> 01:29:26,947
Just give me one second, okay?

1585
01:29:31,538 --> 01:29:34,264
Um, do you wanna talk?

1586
01:29:36,163 --> 01:29:37,682
I'm here if you wanna talk.

1587
01:29:38,959 --> 01:29:41,306
Anything you wanna say is ...

1588
01:29:44,758 --> 01:29:46,553
Your mom's waiting for us too.

1589
01:29:46,588 --> 01:29:48,900
Okay, just give me one second.

1590
01:29:48,934 --> 01:29:49,763
Okay.

1591
01:29:53,940 --> 01:29:54,768
Um.

1592
01:29:59,463 --> 01:30:00,291
Sorry.

1593
01:30:02,742 --> 01:30:04,121
I'm okay.

1594
01:30:04,157 --> 01:30:04,985

Where are you going?

1598
01:31:02,387 --> 01:31:03,181

1599
01:31:06,219 --> 01:31:07,531

1601
01:31:15,159 --> 01:31:16,885
Did you change him?

1602
01:31:16,919 --> 01:31:18,264
Yeah.

1603
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:20,198
I don't know where
the shits come from.

1604
01:31:20,233 --> 01:31:22,200
I already told
you to stop saying

1605
01:31:22,235 --> 01:31:23,374
