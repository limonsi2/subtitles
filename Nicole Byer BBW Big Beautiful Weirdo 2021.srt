00:00:49,425 --> 00:00:50,677
Ugh!

6
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,805
I guess I should go do my show now.

11
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:31,342
Hi.

12
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:36,597
Oh, thank you so much for coming out.

13
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,267
What a treat, what a dream!

14
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,602
[audience cheers]

15
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:46,107
I am so excited to be doing this here

16
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,942
in New York City!

17
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:50,027
[audience cheers and applauds]

18
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,448
It's the city
where I started doing comedy.

19
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:57,785
It is the city
where I dropped a piece of pizza

20
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:59,912
cheese side down…

21
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,290
and then ate it!

00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:03,958
[giggles]

23
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:08,045
It's also the city
where I fucked a cab driver…

00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,630
[giggles]

25
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,715
…and was fingered by another.

26
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,593
[audience cheers]

27
00:02:13,677 --> 00:02:14,718
All right.

28
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:17,222
I know everyone's tired of talking about

29
00:02:17,305 --> 00:02:20,975
Corona and the pandemie,
but we're going to talk about it

30
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:23,687
'cause I took a year
out of my fucking life, okay?

31
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,772
[audience cheers]

32
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:31,027
I think dads had it really hard

33
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,195
during the pandemie.

34
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:36,115
I call it "the pandemie",
keep it light, keep it fresh.

35
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:37,617
[audience laughs]

36
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,913
But yeah, dads had it really hard in 2020,

37
00:02:41,997 --> 00:02:45,542
because it's tough to be absentee
when you can't go nowhere.

38
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,293
[audience laughs]

39
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:55,510
There's a dad here
who that hit right in the heart.

40
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:57,512
[audience laughs]

41
00:02:58,722 --> 00:03:02,017
Also, I think they went
about masks the wrong way.

42
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,187
They were like, "Wear a mask.
Save somebody else now."

43
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,982
No, we are very selfish people.

44
00:03:09,065 --> 00:03:10,525
They should have been like,

45
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:13,820
"If you think you're pretty,
you'll wear a mask!"

46
00:03:13,903 --> 00:03:15,613
[audience laughs]

47
00:03:15,697 --> 00:03:19,200
"Only cute people wear masks!

48
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:22,287
If you're a cutie with a booty,
you'll wear a mask!"

49
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,247
[audience laughs]

50
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:27,750
Because the ugliest motherfuckers

51
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,543
didn't want to wear the mask.

52
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:31,878
[audience laughs and applauds]

53
00:03:31,963 --> 00:03:33,840
No.

54
00:03:33,923 --> 00:03:37,593
They were like,
"What about my civil liberties?"

55
00:03:39,095 --> 00:03:42,223
I'm just like, "Ugh, your face
is a civil disobedience, okay?"

56
00:03:42,307 --> 00:03:43,473
[audience laughs]

57
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:50,315
So something I did during the pandemie is

58
00:03:50,398 --> 00:03:53,985
I went to a drive-by funeral for a cat.

59
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:56,070
[audience laughs]

60
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,575
There is no joke there.

61
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,077
[audience laughs]

62
00:04:03,828 --> 00:04:06,830
It's just an activity that I did.

63
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,295
So my friend Marcy's little black cat,
Bo, tragically passed away.

64
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:15,088
So a friend of ours emailed
our friend group and said,

65
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:17,883
"Hey, let's drive by
her house and scream."

66
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:19,385
[audience laughs]

67
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,097
So that's what we did.

68
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,973
We drove past her house
at five miles an hour being like,

69
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:27,893
"I am sorry!"

70
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:29,728
And she was crying and I was like,

71
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:32,107
"Are you sad or embarrassed?"

72
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,858
[audience laughs]

73
00:04:33,942 --> 00:04:36,735
But you can't ask nobody that.

74
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,113
So later we're recording our podcast,

75
00:04:39,197 --> 00:04:40,615
it's about <i>90 Day Fiancé</i>.

76
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:41,782
[audience cheers]

77
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,160
Oh, okay. Six people know.

78
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:48,832
All right, everybody else out there,
get the fuck up into it, okay?

79
00:04:48,915 --> 00:04:52,627
It is the wildest
fucking show on television.

80
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,505
So we're recording our podcast,
it's called <i>90 Day Bae</i>,

81
00:04:55,588 --> 00:04:57,340
it's on Patreon, it's five dollars.

82
00:04:57,423 --> 00:04:58,717
And we're on Zoom.

83
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,052
Does everyone here know what Zoom is?

84
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:03,178
[audience laughs]

85
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:05,263
[audience laughs louder]

86
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,558
Is everyone on Zoom?

87
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,143
Do we know what Zoom is?

88
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:11,895
What the fuck is Zoom?

89
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:16,150
The definition of "zoom" is to move fast.
To where, my living room?

90
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,152
So…

91
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:20,572
we're on Zoom talking about
these lunatics and…

92
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:24,950
all of a sudden
this little black cat jumps behind her.

93
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,327
And I was like…

94
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:32,208
"Oh no.

95
00:05:33,752 --> 00:05:36,795
Oh no, I'm going to have to tell my friend

96
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,007
that when she turns around

97
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:41,258
the ghost of her dead cat…

98
00:05:42,302 --> 00:05:45,430
is behind her having a nice time.

99
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:48,975
I'm going to have to tell my friend

100
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:51,393
that there's a haunting in her home."

101
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,022
And I started crying, actual tears.

102
00:05:56,565 --> 00:06:00,277
And Marcy was like,
"What the fuck is wrong with you?"

103
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,613
I said, "Marcy,

104
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:04,740
when you turn around,

105
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:07,868
the ghost of your dead cat is there."

106
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:11,247
And Marcy said, "Nicole,

107
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,998
I got a new cat."

108
00:06:13,082 --> 00:06:15,083
[audience laughs]

109
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,463
You got to tell a bitch that, okay?

110
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:23,300
I told that story to my therapist

111
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,385
and she laughed at me.

112
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,388
[audience laughs]

113
00:06:27,472 --> 00:06:31,100
And I was like, "One, I pay you too much.

114
00:06:32,227 --> 00:06:35,395
Two, it was 2020. We had murder hornets.

115
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,898
It could have been
a fucking ghost cat, okay?"

116
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:39,900
-[audience laughs]
-[man] Whoo!

117
00:06:40,902 --> 00:06:42,778
Are there Black people here?

118
00:06:42,862 --> 00:06:44,197
[audience cheers]

119
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,532
Ooh, yes!

120
00:06:45,615 --> 00:06:48,492
I got one right down the front!

121
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,537
Yes! Rosa sat for us all!

122
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,207
And it's not just buses.

123
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,123
Can I--

124
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:56,458
[laughs]

125
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:01,838
Can I ask you a question?

126
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:05,593
Okay, so at the height of the
Black Lives Matter protest last summer,

127
00:07:05,677 --> 00:07:06,927
I don't know about you,

128
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,388
but every single White person

129
00:07:09,472 --> 00:07:13,308
I blinked at, waved at, smiled at,
kicked a leg up at, texted me.

130
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:14,685
[audience laughs]

131
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,647
I heard a lot of White laughter.
They were like, "Yes, I texted."

132
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,107
But-- [chuckles]

133
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,900
"Did they text you?"

134
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:22,943
Yeah. Did the text message say,

135
00:07:23,027 --> 00:07:26,572
"If there's anything I can do,
let me know"?

136
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:29,450
Yes! What the fuck, White people?

137
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:30,618
[audience laughs]

138
00:07:30,702 --> 00:07:32,162
What the fuck?

139
00:07:32,245 --> 00:07:35,205
I don't need to know that
I'm your only Black friend.

140
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,333
[audience laughs]

141
00:07:37,417 --> 00:07:40,127
Keep that shit locked in your heart.

142
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:43,338
Also, I don't need anything, I'm alive.

143
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:44,798
Ha-ha! But…

144
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:46,633
[audience laughs]

145
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,845
[laughs]

146
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,348
But I do gotta say,

147
00:07:52,432 --> 00:07:55,643
I was deeply, truly offended

148
00:07:55,727 --> 00:07:58,020
that the only White people

149
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:59,647
who didn't text me

150
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,148
were all the White dudes I ever fucked.

151
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:03,692
[audience laughs]

152
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:06,903
I was like, "Excuse me!"

153
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,907
Do Black lives only matter
when you're inside of one?

154
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:13,285
Oh come on, White people!

155
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:14,787
[audience laughs]

156
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,538
Come on!

157
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:20,250
Pack up your White guilt
and send it via the postal service!

158
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,795
Do you remember
before the election when we thought

159
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,505
the post office was closing?

160
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,633
[audience laughs]

161
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:31,345
What a goofy ass year!

162
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:32,513
We were all like,

163
00:08:32,597 --> 00:08:35,515
"We got to go buy stamps!
For who? We're on Zoom!"

164
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,518
[audience laughs]

165
00:08:41,022 --> 00:08:44,942
[applause and cheers]

166
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,657
But I do like fucking White dudes.

167
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,198
[audience laughs]

168
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:55,620
I like to fuck 'em so hard
their ancestors cry.

169
00:08:55,703 --> 00:08:57,497
[audience laughs]

170
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,042
I got another one.

171
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:06,255
I love fucking White dudes.

172
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:08,132
Ooh I love it.

173
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:09,758
But I have to be careful

174
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:11,302
because I like rough sex

175
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:14,347
and there's a right way
to get tied up and a wrong way.

176
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,265
[audience laughs]

177
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,642
I got another!

178
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,435
[audience applauds]

179
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:24,607
Ooh baby, I love fucking White dudes.

180
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:25,817
Ooh I love it!

181
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,485
I just like the feeling
of privilege inside of me.

182
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,988
[audience cheers and applauds]

183
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,160
I'm kidding.

184
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,372
I don't only fuck White dudes.

185
00:09:39,497 --> 00:09:42,458
I raised my pussy to not see color.

186
00:09:42,542 --> 00:09:45,127
[audience laughs]

187
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:49,757
But I am horny.

188
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:54,928
And it got to critical levels last year.
It was bad. It was a Code Red.

189
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:57,557
And I was trying to figure out
how to fuck safely.

190
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,725
I was like,
"I'll make these dudes wear a mask."

191
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,643
No, that's not cute. That's not sexy.

192
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:03,812
I was like,
"Ooh, I'll fuck somebody I know."

193
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,815
So I was going through the Rolodex,
the Dick-o-dex, and…

194
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,483
[audience laughs]

195
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,280
I matched with this dude. All right.

196
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,783
I texted this dude
I matched with on Bumble,

197
00:10:15,867 --> 00:10:18,035
who's also like a friend,
and I texted him.

198
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:21,372
I said, "Hey, you want
to meet me at a glory hole?"

199
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,332
[audience laughs]

200
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,918
And he said, "No."

201
00:10:26,002 --> 00:10:27,878
[audience laughs]

202
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:32,425
And then he followed it up with,
"I'm actually dating somebody.

203
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:34,843
Do you want to do my podcast?"

204
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:36,553
[audience groans]

205
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:42,100
That second part,
it hurt worse than the first part.

206
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,727
[audience laughs]

207
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,063
Oh wait, does everybody here know
what a glory hole is?

208
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,692
[audience cheers]

209
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:51,902
I feel like there's some shy people.

210
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,113
Get involved. I'll tell you.

211
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:58,200
Okay, so like a traditional glory hole,

212
00:10:58,283 --> 00:10:59,743
a classic, if you will.

213
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:02,203
[audience laughs]

214
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:09,087
It's a wall with a hole cut out

215
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:12,798
and you put your dick
in there and you're like a Senator. And…

216
00:11:12,882 --> 00:11:15,550
[audience laughs]

217
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,680
…a very cute twink is on the other side,

218
00:11:20,765 --> 00:11:22,223
who kind of looks like you.

219
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:23,850
And…

220
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,478
they're on the other side
on their knees being like,

221
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,813
"Yum, yum!

222
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,692
Choo-choo! My tummy full."

223
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,735
[audience laughs]

224
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,322
So that's a glory hole.

225
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:37,407
And…

226
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,827
And I've been Googling
"glory holes for ladies"

227
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,787
'cause it's a very masculine thing.

228
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:47,207
I'm like, "Where are
the glory holes for the ladies?"

229
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:50,502
Are there glory holes
for ladies here in New York City?

230
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,378
-Probably.
-Probably?

231
00:11:52,463 --> 00:11:54,382
That's not a yes, okay?

232
00:11:54,465 --> 00:11:55,883
[audience laughs]

233
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,802
Truly, I've been Googling it so much.

234
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,678
My FBI agent's like, "Is she okay?"

235
00:12:00,763 --> 00:12:02,347
No, I am not.

236
00:12:02,432 --> 00:12:05,225
No. Very fucking horny.

237
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,437
Also, what a good late night commercial?

238
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,857
"You've heard of glory holes,
introducing glory holes for ladies!"

239
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,900
[audience laughs and applauds]

240
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:17,905
But I can't find any here
in the good old US of A.

241
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:21,450
But I did find some
glory holes in Germany!

242
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:24,620
So I'm going on a vacation!

243
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,163
[audience applauds]

244
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,333
And the way they do it in Germany

245
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:31,085
is a lady lies on a table

246
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:33,295
and there's a wall that cuts her in half.

247
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,965
And then her pussy is
just like out for the taking.

248
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:39,802
And all I could think was,

249
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,805
"What if nobody chooses me?

250
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:48,018
What if I don't feel
slurp, slurp, suck, suck?

251
00:12:48,102 --> 00:12:50,562
[audience laughs]

252
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:59,070
What if the only thing I feel
is the wind on my bald pussy?"

253
00:12:59,155 --> 00:13:00,865
[audience laughs]

254
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:06,662
That is a level of rejection
that I am not ready for, okay?

255
00:13:07,622 --> 00:13:10,082
Something else I learned
during the pandemie

256
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:13,627
is you can order a singular bottle
of ranch to your door.

257
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,378
[audience laughs]

258
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:18,132
But it will cost you $20.

259
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:22,343
So I'm vegan. Thank you.

260
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:25,138
Thank you, she's a hero.
It's my cross to bear.

261
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:26,348
Thank you.

262
00:13:26,432 --> 00:13:27,850
And I was making some vegan

263
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:29,810
[high pitched voice] chik'n nuggets!

264
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:31,603
You know, vegan chik'n nuggets.

265
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:34,273
-How--
-[audience laughs]

266
00:13:34,357 --> 00:13:36,900
How come all vegan food
has K's and apostrophes

267
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,860
where they don't belong?

268
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:42,405
They're like,
"It's chik'n, not chicken. It's chik'n."

269
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,490
So…

270
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:45,117
[audience laughs]

271
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,202
So I was making my vegan chik'n nuggets

272
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:49,288
and I am a vegan, okay.

273
00:13:49,372 --> 00:13:51,373
Before you say… I'm a vegan, all right?

274
00:13:51,457 --> 00:13:52,875
Except for eggs.

275
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:53,958
Um…

276
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:56,212
sometimes Kraft ranch dressing.

277
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:57,503
Sometimes a rib or two.

278
00:13:57,588 --> 00:13:59,465
Okay, maybe I am not a vegan,

279
00:13:59,548 --> 00:14:00,883
but the important thing is

280
00:14:00,967 --> 00:14:03,802
I identify as a vegan.

281
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:04,803
Okay?

282
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:07,388
I'm like the Rachel Dolezal of veganism.

283
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:08,765
All right?

284
00:14:12,937 --> 00:14:14,897
So I was making my vegan chik'n nuggets

285
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,023
and I wanted some ranch.

286
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:19,777
So I hopped onto Postmates
and I ordered my ranch

287
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,070
and I was waiting for it
to come to my door.

288
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:23,280
Ding dong. It comes.

289
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,740
I open the door

290
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:26,908
and there's just a loose bottle of ranch.

291
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:28,743
[audience laughs]

292
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:34,417
No bag, no nothing.

293
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,960
[audience laughs]

294
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:41,132
I mean, for $20 you could
at least give me a bag

295
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:43,175
or tickle my clit, you know?

296
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:44,552
[audience laughs]

297
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:47,428
Imagine there's a button like,
"Tip or tickle?"

298
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:50,015
-[Nicole laughs]
-[audience laughs]

299
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:52,017
And I couldn't help but think about it

300
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,562
from the Postmates perspective, you know?

301
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:56,563
They're working through the pandemie.

302
00:14:56,647 --> 00:14:58,982
They're like,
"I am delivering the essentials.

303
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,858
I am doing the Lord's work."

304
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:02,360
Beep-bop-boop.

305
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:05,072
"One singular bottle of ranch?"

306
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:07,032
[audience laughs]

307
00:15:07,825 --> 00:15:09,993
"This bitch wants me to risk my life

308
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:11,578
for some sauce?

309
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,582
No, I'm not giving her a bag. No way.

310
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:16,792
No.

311
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:20,212
And what? Make her neighbors think
she's ordering <i>essentials</i>?

312
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:22,172
No!

313
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,423
Fuck that bitch!"

314
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:25,008
[laughs]

315
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:26,218
[sighs]

316
00:15:29,347 --> 00:15:31,140
At the end of 2020,

317
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:33,725
I dislocated my ankle.

318
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:37,020
Yeah, 'cause the good Lord was like,
"My child, fuck you."

319
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,938
[audience laughs]

320
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:43,235
I dislocated my ankle

321
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:46,488
because I fell all the way down my stairs

322
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:49,492
because I was too excited
to leave my house.

323
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:50,658
[audience laughs]

324
00:15:51,577 --> 00:15:54,830
And I had to go to
Glendale Memorial Hospital.

325
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:58,292
If you are ever in
the Greater Los Angeles area,

326
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,127
I say, don't go, okay?

327
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,628
[audience laughs]

328
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:03,505
No, I did not have a nice time.

329
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:04,590
No.

330
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:06,383
Honestly, it was very bad.

331
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:09,052
A nurse tried to steal my underwear.

332
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,803
[audience gasps and laughs]

333
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,723
We'll get into it. But first…

334
00:16:12,807 --> 00:16:14,850
[audience laughs]

335
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:18,395
…my ambulance ride was
$700 fucking dollars

336
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,772
with insurance!

337
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,648
And nobody even offered me water.

338
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:26,737
I was like, "This is the worst
Uber I've ever been in."

339
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,615
My God. Also, the hospital

340
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:31,658
propped my leg up with a pillow

341
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:33,868
from my own living room.

342
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:36,122
[audience laughs]

343
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:43,045
People kept walking by
being like, "Target?"

344
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:45,338
I was like, "No, Anthropology.
I'm thriving."

345
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:47,717
-[audience laughs]
-[man] Whoo!

346
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:56,558
It also took seven men
to get me out of my house.

347
00:16:56,642 --> 00:16:58,685
And I was like, "I could be embarrassed"

348
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:01,605
or I could get a gang bang!

349
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,232
[audience laughs]

350
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:04,858
But I did not have a nice time

351
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:06,985
there was no gang bang to be had.

352
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:09,153
And at the hospital I said,

353
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,740
"Excuse me, can I have pain medication?

354
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:13,492
'Cause I am not thriving."

355
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:15,243
And the nurse said, "Oh, okay."

356
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:17,955
And he gives me the IV and he gives me
a little pump of something.

357
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:20,540
And I was like, "Yum, yum, yum.
Yes, she's alive."

358
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:23,002
And I was like,
"Actually, no, I still passed away.

359
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:24,462
What the fuck was that?"

360
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:26,088
And he said it was a placebo.

361
00:17:26,172 --> 00:17:27,882
It was a saline injection.

362
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:31,008
And I said, "Sir,
my ankle looks like a fucking U-turn.

363
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:33,845
You better give me some fucking shit."

364
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:35,430
I don't know if you know this,

365
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,975
but Black and Brown people
are prescribed opioids

366
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:39,935
at a lower rate than White people.

367
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:42,897
So White people have
a higher addiction rate to heroin.

368
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,273
And I said to myself, "Huh?

369
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:47,860
Maybe sometimes racism's good?"

370
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:49,528
[audience laughs]

371
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:58,870
'Cause Black and Brown people have
kind of circumvented the opioid crisis.

372
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:01,998
Anyway, back to that nurse
who tried to steal my underwear.

373
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,583
[audience cheers]

374
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:08,880
So I was lying in
the hospital bed and I said,

375
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,673
"Excuse me, I have to pee."

376
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:13,343
And he said, "Oh no, you can't walk."

377
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:16,513
[audience laughs]

378
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:21,058
I said, "There's a ton of motherfuckers
in this hospital who can't walk,

379
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:22,352
how do they pee?"

380
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,605
And he said, "Let's get Jenny."

381
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:27,690
I was like, "Who the fuck is Jenny?"

382
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,400
Who is she? The Pee Whisperer?

383
00:18:29,485 --> 00:18:30,693
What's happening?

384
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:34,030
So Jenny comes in, and this is truly
what she sounded like, she said,

385
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,783
"Oh no!

386
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:39,452
You gotta go pee-pee!"

387
00:18:39,537 --> 00:18:41,330
[audience laughs]

388
00:18:46,335 --> 00:18:48,170
I said, "Yes, Jenny,

389
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:50,630
I have to pee-pee."

390
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:52,798
And then she explains this machine to me.

391
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:55,260
She goes, "Okay, here is the canister

392
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:56,803
and then here is the hose.

393
00:18:56,887 --> 00:18:58,930
And it sucks it up and you put this part

394
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:00,682
right on your hoo-ha."

395
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:02,267
And I was like, "Hoo-ha?"

396
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:04,687
Hoo-ha?

397
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,438
Use the medical term: "pussy".

398
00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:08,773
[audience laughs]

399
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:10,900
What are we doing? Grow up.

400
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,610
So…

401
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,655
I put it on my "hoo-ha".

402
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:16,198
And Jenny says,

403
00:19:16,282 --> 00:19:19,158
"Okay, go!"

404
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,913
So I start to pee

405
00:19:22,997 --> 00:19:26,082
and it just puddles up right under me.

406
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,417
[audience groans]

407
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,460
I looked at Jenny and I said,

408
00:19:29,545 --> 00:19:31,338
"I don't think it works."

409
00:19:32,965 --> 00:19:34,048
And then Jenny said,

410
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:37,010
"Oh no!

411
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,387
We got to clean you up!"

412
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:43,058
And then Jenny cleaned me up
like I was a big fucking baby.

413
00:19:43,142 --> 00:19:45,727
She was like,
<i>♪ We gotta get the right cheek clean ♪</i>

414
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,187
<i>♪ And the left cheek clean ♪</i>

415
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,607
<i>♪ We gotta get in your crack</i>
<i>I love your butt ♪</i>

416
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:50,857
Boop, boop!

417
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,985
[audience laughs]

418
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,825
She didn't sing.

419
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:02,535
She hummed, which I think is creepier.

420
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:04,913
And when she was done, she said,

421
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:07,582
<i>♪ We got to take your panties</i>
<i>They're all wet ♪</i>

422
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:10,877
I said, "Jenny, they're not wet.
I pulled them down pretty far."

423
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,378
She said, "I'm taking them."

424
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:14,088
I said, "No, please don't."

425
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:15,673
She said, "I am."
I said, "No."

426
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:18,052
We played tug of war
with my fucking underwear

427
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:20,845
until I was like,
"Jenny, they're not fucking wet!"

428
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,097
And then Jenny said,

429
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,265
"Ha-ha!"

430
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:24,557
So then…

431
00:20:24,642 --> 00:20:26,560
[audience laughs]

432
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,072
So then I'm still lying

433
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:41,198
in this fucking hospital bed.

434
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:42,700
I am there for so long.

435
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,535
I am there for a full eight hours.

436
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,747
I clocked in and out and…

437
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:50,208
I looked at the nurse again and I said,

438
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:51,627
"Excuse me,

439
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,087
I have to pee again."

440
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,965
And he said, "Let's get Jenny."

441
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,677
And I said, "Let's get Jenny."

442
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,803
[audience laughs]

443
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:06,850
So Jenny comes back and she says,

444
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:09,227
"Again?"

445
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:13,148
And I was like,
"Yeah, you fucking Teletubby, again."

446
00:21:13,232 --> 00:21:15,233
[audience laughs]

447
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:19,320
So we go through it again.
I put the thing on my hoo-ha.

448
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,572
The only difference is

449
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:23,075
the other nurse didn't leave the room.

450
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:24,325
And Jenny said,

451
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,828
"Okay, go!"

452
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,038
And before I could go
the other nurse said,

453
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:31,375
"Wait, Jenny,
you didn't turn on the machine."

454
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,627
[audience laughs]

455
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:42,010
Do you think Jenny

456
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:45,097
has the most specific kink of all time?

457
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,932
[audience applauds and laughs]

458
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:56,483
She went all the way to nursing school,

459
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:58,985
got a job in a hospital

460
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:01,863
and was like, "Fingies crossed.

461
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:04,198
I'll get to clean up a messy fat Black

462
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:06,117
and fill my pockets with panties."

463
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,618
[cackles]

464
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:10,747
[audience laughs]

465
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:14,125
[woman laughs loudly]

466
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:17,587
[laughs]

467
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,880
That laugh.

468
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:20,632
[audience laughs]

469
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:24,468
I had a lot of time
to myself to recuperate

470
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:26,972
and I was watching just a lot of TV,

471
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:29,057
just consuming all of the content.

472
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,102
And I was watching
a documentary on the KKK.

473
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:34,478
<i>Easy Breezy, Beautiful Tuesday.</i>

474
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:36,022
[audience laughs]

475
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,900
And as I was watching it,
the man on the screen said,

476
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:41,110
[Southern accent] "I'm a grand wizard."

477
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,945
And I was like, "The fuck?"

478
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,363
And then his friend said,

479
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:46,115
"And I'm a grand dragon."

480
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,783
I said, "Hey,

481
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,995
that sounds like some <i>Harry Potter </i>shit."

482
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:51,287
[audience laughs]

483
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,415
So I did some investigative journalism.

484
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:55,083
I took it to the streets.

485
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:57,168
I looked at Wikipedia and…

486
00:22:57,252 --> 00:22:59,253
[audience laughs]

487
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:01,088
Stay with me.

488
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:03,842
I think <i>Harry Potter</i>

489
00:23:03,925 --> 00:23:06,010
is based on the KKK.

490
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,053
[audience laughs]

491
00:23:10,182 --> 00:23:12,683
Let's take a journey!

492
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:15,187
[audience applause]

493
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,688
[man] Whoo!

494
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,942
So, in the KKK they have grand wizards.

495
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:22,068
What is Harry?

496
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:23,903
A Grand Wizard.

497
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:25,738
In the KKK they wear hooded cloaks.

498
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:27,365
What do they wear at Hogwarts?

499
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:28,658
Hooded cloaks.

500
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:32,287
In the KKK they have something
called a Nighthawk and a grand Turk.

501
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:36,332
I was like, "That's just something found
in the Forbidden Forest."

502
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,962
Now, the whole premise of the KKK--
"Premise." [laughs]

503
00:23:40,045 --> 00:23:41,128
What?

504
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:42,755
[laughs]

505
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,675
No, the KKK's whole deal is…

506
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,885
[audience laughs]

507
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:54,100
It's keeping White people
and Black people separate.

508
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:56,185
The whole premise of <i>Harry Potter</i>

509
00:23:56,268 --> 00:24:00,232
is keeping magical people
and non-magical people separate.

510
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:02,025
So…

511
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:04,485
if we follow my logic.

512
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,320
Not yet, it fucking checks out, okay.

513
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,323
Non-magical people

514
00:24:08,407 --> 00:24:09,825
are Black people

515
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:11,785
and they call them "Muggles".

516
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:13,703
And a slur for them is "Mudblood",

517
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:16,413
which is like the N-word
of the wizarding world.

518
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:18,708
Also at Hogwarts,
they have Muggle Studies.

519
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:20,210
I was like, "Huh?

520
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:21,920
That's just Black History Month.

521
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:24,422
[audience laughs]

522
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:27,175
Truly, I think JKKKK Rowling…

523
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:29,802
[audience laughs]

524
00:24:29,887 --> 00:24:32,180
[cheering]

525
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:37,810
…was sitting in that coffee shop,

526
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,897
taking a break from
writing and hating Trans people.

527
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,273
And…

528
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:43,983
[laughs]

529
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:45,277
It's a full-time job.

530
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,443
And…

531
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:50,073
she was perusing the internet,
and she was just like,

532
00:24:50,157 --> 00:24:54,285
"Oh, the KKK.

533
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:57,872
Ooh that seems awful but also whimsical!"

534
00:24:57,955 --> 00:24:59,875
[audience laughs]

535
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:03,002
Because if you think about it,
Harry is half-Muggle, half-Wizard.

536
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:04,753
He's mixed. Hermione is a Muggle.

537
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,840
She's Black. Ron's a Wizard. He's White.

538
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:08,508
So if you really think about it,

539
00:25:08,592 --> 00:25:10,552
<i>Harry Potter </i>is a story of a mixed boy,

540
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:12,553
his Black friend, his woke White friend,

541
00:25:12,637 --> 00:25:16,265
as they try to overthrow the racial
patriarchy of the wizarding world!

542
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,643
[audience laughs and cheers]

543
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:22,897
I need to get fucked, okay?

544
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,148
[audience laughs]

545
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,657
I've been traveling a lot more

546
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:36,035
since we're pretending
that the pandemie is done.

547
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,120
It's not.

548
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:41,165
And I got to go to Pennsylvania.

549
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:43,252
Yuck! Woof! Ugh!

550
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:44,920
Ugh!

551
00:25:45,003 --> 00:25:47,547
What a rectangle of trash, truly.

552
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,423
[audience laughs]

553
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:52,385
From Philadelphia to Shits-burg,

554
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:53,845
throw it away.

555
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:57,515
Is anyone here from Pennsylvania?

556
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:58,850
[audience members cheer]

557
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:00,727
Whatever I stand by it.

558
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:02,270
[audience laughs]

559
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:06,023
You escaped.
There's a reason why you're not there.

560
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:09,568
So I was driving through
this fucking rectangle and…

561
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:13,030
I ran out of gas in White Haven.

562
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,657
Lucky me.

563
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,992
[audience laughs]

564
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,160
[man laughs hard]

565
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:23,333
You laughed too hard at my misfortune.

566
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:25,835
[audience laughs]

567
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:28,045
I pull into this old rickety gas station.

568
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,463
I get out of my rental car.

569
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:32,925
I'm trying to put my credit card
in the pump. It doesn't take cards.

570
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,260
I was like, "The fuck?"

571
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:36,428
So I had to go inside.
I went in and said,

572
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:38,307
"Hey, excuse me, one gas please."

573
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:41,267
[audience laughs]

574
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,268
I don't know how to order gas.

575
00:26:44,062 --> 00:26:46,982
I'm from New Jersey
where it's illegal to pump it yourself.

576
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:48,567
[audience cheers]

577
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:51,402
Okay. That is some peasant shit, okay?

578
00:26:53,322 --> 00:26:54,530
In New Jersey, we're all

579
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,533
[British accent]
Kings and Queens of our vehicles.

580
00:26:57,617 --> 00:26:59,160
We roll down the window and go,

581
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:01,287
"Ta-ta fill it with your cheapest!"

582
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,582
[audience laughs]

583
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:06,500
So I said, "One gas please."

584
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:11,715
And inside were two fat White dudes
with six teeth among them.

585
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:16,427
And for whatever reason
they had Southern accents.

586
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:20,557
So I said, "Oh me, oh my,

587
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:23,560
I better get this gas to go."

588
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:25,062
[audience laughs]

589
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:32,110
So I get my gas to go.

590
00:27:32,193 --> 00:27:34,862
And I'm walking back to the rental car

591
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:36,613
and I am so clumsy.

592
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:39,033
I stepped off the curb
and I twisted my ankle.

593
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:41,160
And all I could think of was,

594
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:43,830
"This is how Black people die."

595
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:46,082
So I started limping to my car,

596
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:48,710
looking behind me, limping to my car,

597
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:50,670
looking behind me.

598
00:27:50,753 --> 00:27:53,757
But they would've never caught up.
They were too fat.

599
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,383
Also…

600
00:27:56,718 --> 00:28:00,222
what do you think they were thinking
when they looked out the window?

601
00:28:00,305 --> 00:28:01,723
Do you think they were like,

602
00:28:01,807 --> 00:28:04,975
"Ooh, look at that nice Black lady
doing the 'Thriller' dance!"

603
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,643
[audience laughs]

604
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:19,407
I also got to go to Appleton, Wisconsin.

605
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,702
Oh boy, what a cute name for a town.

606
00:28:22,785 --> 00:28:25,037
Appleton, Wisconsin.

607
00:28:25,122 --> 00:28:28,583
And then you get there and they're like,
"We tricked ya, we're trash!"

608
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:31,335
[audience laughs]

609
00:28:32,837 --> 00:28:35,798
I don't want to say everybody
who came to my shows were bad,

610
00:28:35,882 --> 00:28:39,343
but a lot of people were
on their worst fucking behavior.

611
00:28:39,427 --> 00:28:42,930
It was like they ate too much cheese
and forgot how to fucking act.

612
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:47,768
During my show I encountered
a White woman with a birthday.

613
00:28:48,687 --> 00:28:50,147
[audience laughs]

614
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,815
Yeah. You already know.

615
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:53,650
[audience laughs harder]

616
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:57,987
There is almost nothing on this planet,

617
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:01,657
louder or more powerful

618
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,243
than a White woman with a birthday.

619
00:29:05,328 --> 00:29:07,372
A White woman could steal a baby and go,

620
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:10,333
"It's my birthday!"

621
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:12,543
[audience laughs]

622
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,717
And legally that's her baby.

623
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,302
[audience laughs]

624
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:29,352
The White woman with
a birthday I encountered,

625
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:30,853
let's call her…

626
00:29:30,937 --> 00:29:33,063
mm, I don't know Krista,

627
00:29:33,147 --> 00:29:34,690
because that's her name.

628
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,775
[audience laughs]

629
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,277
How do I know it's her name?

630
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,570
During my show she said,

631
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:44,075
"I'm Krista, it's my birthday!"

632
00:29:47,912 --> 00:29:50,415
So then I roasted her for a little bit

633
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,083
and I'll tell you something.

634
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:55,837
Krista, woo baby, she did not like that.

635
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,422
[audience laughs]

636
00:29:57,505 --> 00:30:02,343
No, because Krista evolved
into her final form,

637
00:30:03,553 --> 00:30:06,263
which is a crying White woman
with a birthday.

638
00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:08,307
[audience laughs]

639
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:12,228
A crying White woman with a birthday
is the Mutu of the Pokémon world.

640
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:14,147
[audience laughs]

641
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,985
A crying White woman with a birthday

642
00:30:19,068 --> 00:30:21,320
is Thanos's glove.

643
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:23,197
Do you understand what I'm saying?

644
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,035
A crying White woman with a birthday
is literal kryptonite to common sense,

645
00:30:27,118 --> 00:30:28,160
okay?

646
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,913
I have been in a bar bathroom,
seen a bitch crying

647
00:30:30,997 --> 00:30:32,998
surrounded by other bitches being like,

648
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:35,252
"Ah! Somebody help her it's her birthday!"

649
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:37,545
[audience laughs]

650
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:52,935
And I'll tell you guys something.

651
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:56,563
I enjoyed watching Krista cry.

652
00:30:56,647 --> 00:30:58,817
[audience applauds and cheers]

653
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:05,113
I was like, "Is it <i>my </i>birthday?"

654
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:10,077
Because I suck up White women power
and their energy.

655
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,038
I watched her cry and I was like…

656
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:13,998
[sucking in breath]

657
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:21,923
I was Bette Midler in <i>Hocus Pocus, </i>okay?

658
00:31:22,007 --> 00:31:24,217
[audience laughs and cheers]

659
00:31:27,345 --> 00:31:30,723
I was sucking it up
so I could evolve to <i>my </i>final state,

660
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:34,602
which is an unaffected Black woman
who doesn't give a fuck that you're crying

661
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:36,228
or that it's your birthday.

662
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:39,065
[audience cheers]

663
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:42,943
[high-pitch voice]
I so sorry, I don't care!

664
00:31:43,027 --> 00:31:46,155
Because I if cried every time
something didn't go my way,

665
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,282
I'd be a literal walking swimming pool.

666
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:50,868
And I can't get this wig wet,
it was too expensive.

667
00:31:51,953 --> 00:31:52,995
It was free.

668
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:54,038
I…

669
00:31:54,122 --> 00:31:55,540
[audience laughs]

670
00:31:57,292 --> 00:31:59,377
I have been watching a ton

671
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,422
of these <i>Karen Gone Wild </i>videos.

672
00:32:02,505 --> 00:32:04,173
Have you guys been watching them?

673
00:32:04,257 --> 00:32:05,257
[audience cheers]

674
00:32:05,342 --> 00:32:08,637
Oh my God. They are truly
so bat shit fucking bonkers.

675
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,178
I love them.

676
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,848
As I watch them I'm always just like,

677
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:14,933
who the fuck do you go home to?

678
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:19,105
You know, like, who the fuck loves you?

679
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:21,023
Truly.

680
00:32:21,107 --> 00:32:23,317
Like, is your kid sitting on the couch,

681
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,487
scrolling through Instagram being like,

682
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,072
"Mom!"

683
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:30,533
You come in wearing
the same shirt and it's like,

684
00:32:30,617 --> 00:32:33,077
"Did you come directly
from the hate crime?"

685
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,372
[audience laughs]

686
00:32:41,085 --> 00:32:44,797
How do you talk to your partner
when they fucking act like that?

687
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,842
Do you wait for nightfall
when you're about to eat them out?

688
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:49,760
No, I'm kidding.

689
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:51,387
Nobody eats these women out.

690
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,015
No!

691
00:32:54,098 --> 00:32:57,227
Otherwise they wouldn't
be screaming in public.

692
00:32:57,977 --> 00:33:01,897
And I get the irony of me
screaming at you people in public.

693
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,858
I do need to be eaten out more.

694
00:33:03,942 --> 00:33:06,193
[laughs]

695
00:33:06,277 --> 00:33:07,778
But as I watch these videos,

696
00:33:07,862 --> 00:33:11,740
I realize that there's only
really like three levels of a Karen.

697
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,535
The first level she's all indignant.
She's like, "Yes,

698
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:18,330
I told that Brown woman
to go back to her brown country.

699
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,332
What of it?"

700
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:21,667
[mouthing words]

701
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,003
[audience laughs]

702
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,257
Second level, she's a little angrier.

703
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,340
She's like, "Yes,

704
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:31,510
I told that Brown woman
to go back to her brown country.

705
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:34,805
Also I think she's shoplifting
'cause I saw a twinkle in her eye.

706
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:36,598
No, I don't work here.

707
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:38,558
No, I've never shopped here.

708
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:40,143
Also, are these on sale?"

709
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:42,480
[audience laughs]

710
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:48,610
The third level,
I call this "The Ultimate Karen."

711
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,947
She's found in a grocery store.

712
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:54,658
She's throwing shit
out of her shopping cart.

713
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:57,578
She's like, "Yes, I told that Brown woman

714
00:33:57,662 --> 00:33:59,497
to go back to her brown country.

715
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,375
No, I don't eat raisins.
They look like old Black people.

716
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:04,335
[audience laughs]

717
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:09,632
No, I don't eat dates.
They look like old fat Black people.

718
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:11,800
Pretzels? Can't eat them.

719
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,928
Flexible Black people.

720
00:34:14,012 --> 00:34:16,472
I do not eat gingerbread men.

721
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:19,767
They look like fancy naked Black people.

722
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,143
And if they're so fancy,

723
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:23,520
why are they naked?

724
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,105
Yes, I called her the N-word.

725
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,940
I used a hard R and a hard G.

726
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:30,110
But what you don't know is
I'm going to issue an apology later

727
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,570
because my dog died.

728
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:33,782
So I'm the real victim, me!

729
00:34:33,907 --> 00:34:35,908
A White woman. It's a dark life

730
00:34:35,992 --> 00:34:38,243
without her four-legged friend, her pooch.

731
00:34:38,327 --> 00:34:39,745
I'm being persecuted

732
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:42,332
because I am White woman!"

733
00:34:42,415 --> 00:34:44,708
[audience laughs and applauds]

734
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,553
There's a White woman here right now
who is like, "Oh…

735
00:34:56,637 --> 00:34:58,555
[audience laughs]

736
00:34:59,682 --> 00:35:02,518
…she's talking about me!"

737
00:35:02,602 --> 00:35:04,728
But listen to your friend Kelly Clarkson.

738
00:35:04,812 --> 00:35:07,148
Make a wish, take a chance and break away.

739
00:35:07,232 --> 00:35:10,568
[audience laughs and cheers]

740
00:35:24,207 --> 00:35:25,917
[sighs] I'm tired.

741
00:35:27,168 --> 00:35:28,418
I'm so tired.

742
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:31,713
I was shaving my pussy
in the shower the other day

743
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:35,175
and I got tired midway through.

744
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,843
So I stopped.

745
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:38,387
[audience laughs]

746
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,347
And then to make myself feel better.

747
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:43,433
I said, "Oh Nicole,
this is definitely a two-shower job."

748
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:45,770
[audience laughs]

749
00:35:47,438 --> 00:35:49,440
It's still not done.

750
00:35:49,523 --> 00:35:51,358
[audience laughs]

751
00:35:51,442 --> 00:35:52,568
I'm tired.

752
00:35:52,652 --> 00:35:55,572
I told that joke in Tacoma
and this lady yelled at me,

753
00:35:55,655 --> 00:35:57,823
"A three-shower job!"

754
00:35:57,907 --> 00:36:00,075
[audience laughs]

755
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:05,205
And I cannot stop thinking
about how big her pussy is.

756
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,625
[audience laughs]

757
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:09,918
Because I only have two lips.

758
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:11,212
I…

759
00:36:11,295 --> 00:36:13,422
[audience laughs]

760
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:19,137
I ended up fucking
an audience member after a show.

761
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,847
Thank you.

762
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:23,015
[audience cheers]

763
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:26,643
And he was an Irishman from Ireland.

764
00:36:26,727 --> 00:36:28,562
So he had that like whole accent.

765
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:30,690
When he came, he was like, "Arr-da-dee.

766
00:36:30,773 --> 00:36:32,525
I know who stole my lucky charms."

767
00:36:32,608 --> 00:36:34,110
[audience laughs]

768
00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:37,613
I'm kidding.

769
00:36:37,697 --> 00:36:40,157
What he actually said was,

770
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,785
[Irish accent] "Ya weren't kidding
about being half-shaven now were ya?"

771
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,622
[audience laughs and applauds]

772
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:53,922
"If we were in Ireland,
I'd call ya Patchy O'Hoolaghan."

773
00:36:54,005 --> 00:36:56,090
[audience laughs]

774
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:57,300
And I was like,

775
00:36:57,383 --> 00:37:00,720
"How do you Irish goodbye
from your own hotel room?"

776
00:37:00,803 --> 00:37:03,722
[audience laughs]

777
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:04,890
I'm tired.

778
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:06,808
[audience laughs]

779
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:09,437
I'm so tired. I'm tired of movie remakes.

780
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,813
Great segue, right?

781
00:37:10,897 --> 00:37:12,690
Like…

782
00:37:12,773 --> 00:37:15,943
why are they remaking everything?
I already saw it. Truly.

783
00:37:16,027 --> 00:37:18,737
Who was that new <i>Lion King </i>for?

784
00:37:21,782 --> 00:37:25,327
What child saw the original
<i>Lion King </i>and was like,

785
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:29,123
[child voice] "I mean
I get that they're lions, but oh boy,

786
00:37:29,207 --> 00:37:31,917
they were not realistic enough!"

787
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,753
[audience laughs]

788
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:36,755
Who was it for?

789
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:38,507
And then Beyoncé was Nala.

790
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,883
Who signed off on that?

791
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:41,510
[audience laughs]

792
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:44,180
Who thought that was a good idea?

793
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:47,015
"Simba, let's go to the watering hole."

794
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,727
[audience laughs and applauds]

795
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:57,860
Who thought that was a good idea?

796
00:37:57,943 --> 00:38:01,197
And if you don't know
what Beyoncé's speaking voice sounds like,

797
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,242
[mimics Beyoncé] tonight
when you go home, tuck yourself in,

798
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:06,535
watch a video on YouTube,
and you'll be like,

799
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:08,870
"Hey, that was a pretty good impression."

800
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,957
[audience laughs]

801
00:38:14,002 --> 00:38:16,795
But my point is Beyoncé is too powerful

802
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:19,173
to be a secondary character.

803
00:38:19,257 --> 00:38:21,967
If you're remaking
the <i>Lion King </i>with Beyoncé,

804
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,262
let Beyoncé be the Lion King!

805
00:38:24,345 --> 00:38:26,722
[audience cheers]

806
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:30,642
But it is funny, Simba.

807
00:38:30,727 --> 00:38:32,268
They also…

808
00:38:32,353 --> 00:38:34,188
[audience laughs]

809
00:38:36,565 --> 00:38:38,900
They also remade this movie,
<i>What Women Want?</i>

810
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,610
Do you guys remember that movie?

811
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,405
Okay, if you don't remember it,

812
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:45,532
it's a movie that starred Mel Gibson.

813
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:47,410
-He could hear the--
-[woman whoops]

814
00:38:47,493 --> 00:38:49,162
Okay. He could…

815
00:38:49,245 --> 00:38:51,163
[audience laughs]

816
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:57,587
Woo for Mel Gibson?

817
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,257
Have you been in quarantine
your whole life?

818
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,343
-[audience cheers and claps]
-[Nicole giggles]

819
00:39:07,763 --> 00:39:10,515
Okay. So <i>What Women Want </i>is a movie

820
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,643
that starred Mel Gibson.

821
00:39:12,727 --> 00:39:14,687
He could hear the thoughts of women

822
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:17,022
and he used that to treat them better.

823
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:18,398
And then Mel Gibson said,

824
00:39:18,482 --> 00:39:20,025
"This stays in the movie."

825
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:22,110
[audience laughs]

826
00:39:22,987 --> 00:39:24,155
Got him.

827
00:39:24,238 --> 00:39:26,573
So then…

828
00:39:26,657 --> 00:39:29,202
they remade the movie
with Taraji P. Henson.

829
00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:31,287
And it's called <i>What Men Want.</i>

830
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:33,247
And I was like, "Huh?"

831
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:35,332
We already know…

832
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:36,875
[audience laughs]

833
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,960
…what men want.

834
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,213
What is that movie? What is it?

835
00:39:41,297 --> 00:39:43,632
Is it Taraji walking around,
having a nice day?

836
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:46,510
She sees a man, she waves, he waves back.

837
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:48,762
Then she hears his thought
and all it is is,

838
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:50,597
"I want you to guzzle my cum."

839
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,850
[audience laughs]

840
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:58,813
What is that movie?

841
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:01,692
Is it just an hour and a half
of her being afraid?

842
00:40:01,775 --> 00:40:03,235
What is it?

843
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:05,445
[audience laughs and claps]

844
00:40:08,782 --> 00:40:11,160
It might sound like I hate men.

845
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:13,162
Hey, hey, hey. I do.

846
00:40:14,122 --> 00:40:15,705
I do.

847
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:17,458
[audience cheers and claps]

848
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:23,630
A lot of you gentlemen
are real fucking dumpsters, okay?

849
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:25,842
But also, I really want a boyfriend.

850
00:40:25,925 --> 00:40:27,552
[giggles]

851
00:40:27,635 --> 00:40:30,428
I just want to like hop in
the dumpster and suck a dick,

852
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:31,930
you know what I'm saying?

853
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:33,223
Just get in there and be like…

854
00:40:33,307 --> 00:40:35,267
"Num, num, num, num."

855
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,435
Imagine that's how I suck dick.

856
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,188
[audience laughs]

857
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:42,692
Like I'm playing the jazz sax.

858
00:40:42,775 --> 00:40:44,777
"Da-da-da-da-ding!"

859
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:49,072
He's like, "Can you get on your knees?"
I'm like, "Catch me."

860
00:40:49,157 --> 00:40:51,117
[audience laughs]

861
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,035
I'm on the ceiling like <i>Hereditary.</i>

862
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:56,080
[audience laughs]

863
00:41:05,422 --> 00:41:07,382
I decided in the beginning of this year

864
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,635
to like push myself out of my comfort zone

865
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:11,345
and try something new like…

866
00:41:11,428 --> 00:41:13,638
anal. No, I'm kidding.

867
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:15,933
No, I love anal. Lube me up.

868
00:41:16,017 --> 00:41:17,100
But…

869
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:18,935
[audience laughs]

870
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:22,690
…what I ended up doing was
I signed up for a twerk class.

871
00:41:22,773 --> 00:41:26,152
And when I got there,
it was me and 11 White women.

872
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:29,112
And I got there before the teacher

873
00:41:29,197 --> 00:41:32,323
and I have a fat ass and I felt
22 eyes look at me and be like,

874
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:33,492
"She's here."

875
00:41:33,617 --> 00:41:35,702
[audience laughs]

876
00:41:39,832 --> 00:41:43,127
"She hath risen to teach us to twerketh."

877
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:45,712
And I told you earlier,
I suck up White women power

878
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:47,422
and their energy. So I was like…

879
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,048
[sucking in breath]

880
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:52,720
Woo! It is all for you
barbecue Beckys, you library Lauras.

881
00:41:52,803 --> 00:41:56,223
I'm gonna teach you
how the fuck to do this. Hey!

882
00:41:56,307 --> 00:41:59,560
But then the teacher came
and I was like, "Oh yes, over here."

883
00:41:59,643 --> 00:42:00,978
[audience laughs]

884
00:42:01,062 --> 00:42:03,855
And then the music started.
You guys, I have no rhythm.

885
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,023
Ha!

886
00:42:05,107 --> 00:42:08,902
What a devastating thing
to find out in person.

887
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:11,405
My ass was a brick. It would not move.

888
00:42:11,488 --> 00:42:14,492
It was like, "I rebuke movement." Truly.

889
00:42:14,575 --> 00:42:17,160
It was fucking useless.
It was like the Liberty bell.

890
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,413
Big with a crack.
People love to look at it,

891
00:42:19,497 --> 00:42:21,665
but fucking useless. I hate Pennsylvania.

892
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:23,250
[audience laughs and cheers]

893
00:42:28,422 --> 00:42:31,050
There's a metal detector at that bell.

894
00:42:31,133 --> 00:42:33,510
Who the fuck is rolling up
to a bell being like,

895
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:35,095
"Ding dong, big poppy pop!"

896
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:37,305
[audience laughs]

897
00:42:44,772 --> 00:42:46,690
And after our class, I was really sad.

898
00:42:46,773 --> 00:42:49,360
I was walking back to my car.
I was like, "Aw, rats.

899
00:42:49,443 --> 00:42:50,818
Ah, dang it."

900
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:53,613
[groans]

901
00:42:53,697 --> 00:42:54,948
[scoffs]

902
00:42:55,032 --> 00:42:56,283
"I'm a bad Black."

903
00:42:56,367 --> 00:42:57,618
And okay.

904
00:42:57,702 --> 00:43:01,747
That is not a phrase you White people
can leave here with, okay?

905
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:03,957
But I can say it, I'm a bad Black.

906
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:07,043
And I was thinking of the other ways
I'm a bad Black.

907
00:43:07,127 --> 00:43:09,087
And I look like I can sing.

908
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:11,382
[audience laughs]

909
00:43:15,552 --> 00:43:18,472
You're like, "That bitch is soulful."
No, tone deaf.

910
00:43:18,555 --> 00:43:20,057
But, um…

911
00:43:21,017 --> 00:43:22,727
every time I go to karaoke,

912
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:24,978
people get <i>so </i>excited.

913
00:43:25,062 --> 00:43:26,522
I walk in and they're like,

914
00:43:26,605 --> 00:43:28,482
"Ooh-oh!"

915
00:43:28,565 --> 00:43:31,443
"Ooh, there's a little
Aretha in the house."

916
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:36,823
"Girl, ooh, it's Jennifer Hudson
before Weight Watchers."

917
00:43:37,742 --> 00:43:39,743
Fuck all of you. That's a perfect joke.

918
00:43:39,827 --> 00:43:41,870
[audience laughs and cheers]

919
00:43:46,917 --> 00:43:48,168
And I know I can't sing.

920
00:43:48,252 --> 00:43:51,255
So I do this a little teaser.
I'm like, "Maybe I will, no I won't.

921
00:43:51,338 --> 00:43:52,923
Maybe I will, no I couldn't.

922
00:43:53,007 --> 00:43:54,508
Maybe I will. I mean, no."

923
00:43:54,592 --> 00:43:57,052
Then I get drunk and I'm like,
"Excuse me."

924
00:43:57,135 --> 00:43:58,845
[audience laughs]

925
00:44:01,057 --> 00:44:02,223
"I'll do it."

926
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:04,017
So,

927
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:07,437
I get on stage. I start swaying off beat.

928
00:44:11,192 --> 00:44:12,818
Everyone's like, "She'll get it."

929
00:44:12,902 --> 00:44:14,362
I won't.

930
00:44:14,445 --> 00:44:16,280
[audience laughs]

931
00:44:16,363 --> 00:44:19,073
And then I start singing
and this is me really trying.

932
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:21,702
<i>♪ Do you believe in love after love? ♪</i>

933
00:44:21,785 --> 00:44:22,912
<i>♪ After love ♪</i>

934
00:44:22,995 --> 00:44:24,455
It's not good, it's bad.

935
00:44:24,538 --> 00:44:26,748
No, Cher would truly
shoot me in the street.

936
00:44:26,832 --> 00:44:28,458
But, uh…

937
00:44:28,542 --> 00:44:30,752
the last time I did karaoke

938
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:33,213
I sang that song and during a lull,

939
00:44:33,297 --> 00:44:35,298
this man just went, "Painful!"

940
00:44:35,382 --> 00:44:37,425
[audience laughs]

941
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:46,185
Okay. More about me.

942
00:44:46,268 --> 00:44:48,312
I've said it a 100 times during this set,

943
00:44:48,395 --> 00:44:49,938
but I'm a single woman.

944
00:44:50,022 --> 00:44:52,190
And I was thinking to myself,

945
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:53,733
"Nicole,

946
00:44:53,817 --> 00:44:56,403
how have you dated anyone
past three dates?

947
00:44:56,487 --> 00:44:59,030
How?"

948
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:01,992
And I was like, "Oh yeah, I tricked them."

949
00:45:02,075 --> 00:45:03,743
[laughs]

950
00:45:03,827 --> 00:45:06,163
Because men seem
to really love a chill girl.

951
00:45:06,247 --> 00:45:07,247
[giggles]

952
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:08,998
You know, a girl who's chill.

953
00:45:09,082 --> 00:45:10,125
A chill girl.

954
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:12,543
And I'm not chill,
I'm fucking crazy, okay?

955
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:14,378
[audience laughs]

956
00:45:14,463 --> 00:45:16,840
I'll be saying normal things
out loud to a guy

957
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:20,177
and thinking the most insane things.

958
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:22,847
Out loud I'm like, "Tee-hee,

959
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:24,263
yes, you're very funny.

960
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:26,142
Let's get a drink. Who me?

961
00:45:26,225 --> 00:45:27,642
I love a taco."

962
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,102
And then…

963
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,315
And then I'm thinking insane things like,

964
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:37,360
"Why does it take you more
than 30 seconds to text me back?"

965
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:38,862
[cackles]

966
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:42,698
"Will you ever love me
more than you love your dog?"

967
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,618
[cackles]

968
00:45:44,702 --> 00:45:46,787
"I know it's only been three months,

969
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:49,457
but if you die,
do I get to go to your funeral?

970
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:51,750
And is that when
I get to meet your mother?"

971
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:52,960
[laughs]

972
00:45:58,173 --> 00:45:59,633
That last one's not a joke.

973
00:45:59,717 --> 00:46:00,842
I…

974
00:46:01,885 --> 00:46:04,638
said that out loud to a friend

975
00:46:04,722 --> 00:46:07,515
and she was like,
"Bitch you got to chill."

976
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:11,228
But I've been observing
you couples out in the wild.

977
00:46:11,353 --> 00:46:13,563
And I think I've figured it out.

978
00:46:13,647 --> 00:46:16,442
You trick them by being chill at first.

979
00:46:16,525 --> 00:46:18,693
And then a couple months in,

980
00:46:18,777 --> 00:46:21,738
you get to be fucking crazy.

981
00:46:21,822 --> 00:46:26,910
Truly, the arguments you people have
in public are fucking bonkers, okay.

982
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:29,453
And I fucking want in, all right?

983
00:46:29,538 --> 00:46:31,080
[audience laughs]

984
00:46:31,165 --> 00:46:34,292
I want to be in an elevator
with my boyfriend and six victims.

985
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:35,752
And…

986
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:37,795
[audience laughs]

987
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:41,425
…I want to look up at him
as he's taller than me and say,

988
00:46:41,508 --> 00:46:44,302
"Hey, let's have a baby."

989
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:46,095
[audience laughs]

990
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:48,515
And he's like,
"Nicole now is not a good time."

991
00:46:48,598 --> 00:46:51,727
And I'm like, "There's never a good time."

992
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:54,855
I don't even want a baby.
I just want those six people to know

993
00:46:54,938 --> 00:46:56,898
we're gonna talk about this later.

994
00:46:56,982 --> 00:46:59,025
[audience laughs]

995
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:02,403
I was in a supermarket recently
in the produce section.

996
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:03,530
Thank you.

997
00:47:03,613 --> 00:47:05,032
And…

998
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:10,120
there was a couple shopping for apples
and he was nuzzling her neck and she said,

999
00:47:10,203 --> 00:47:11,830
"Tee-hee-hee.

1000
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,667
Tee-hee-hee.

1001
00:47:15,542 --> 00:47:16,543
Tee.

1002
00:47:16,627 --> 00:47:20,297
So, you're a Red Delicious, what am I?"

1003
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:23,008
And he goes,
"Oh, I don't know, a Granny Smith."

1004
00:47:23,675 --> 00:47:26,470
[audience laughs]

1005
00:47:26,553 --> 00:47:29,472
The way this woman reacted.

1006
00:47:29,557 --> 00:47:31,517
She truly kicked the cart and was like,

1007
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:34,018
"A Granny Smith?!"

1008
00:47:35,645 --> 00:47:37,730
They probably went home and had hate sex.

1009
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:39,608
I want in, okay?

1010
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:42,777
I was at a restaurant recently

1011
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,322
eavesdropping on a couple
trying to scoop secrets,

1012
00:47:45,405 --> 00:47:47,448
and the server came over and said,

1013
00:47:47,532 --> 00:47:50,785
"How's dinner?" and she said,
"Funny story.

1014
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:54,372
So, when our food came,
I made him switch with me."

1015
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:59,002
And I was like,
"This bitch stole this man's food."

1016
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:00,545
There are rules.

1017
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:02,297
He agreed to go to a restaurant.

1018
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,048
He sat down, he opened the menu.

1019
00:48:04,132 --> 00:48:06,133
He said, "I want that, that came to me."

1020
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:08,595
And she said, "Nuh-uh."
Do you know what I mean?

1021
00:48:08,678 --> 00:48:11,097
And she probably got
a good deep dicking at home.

1022
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,307
I want in!

1023
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:14,183
[audience laughs]

1024
00:48:15,685 --> 00:48:18,688
I want to behave poorly in public
and behind closed doors

1025
00:48:18,772 --> 00:48:21,733
he's like, "I tolerate you."
You know what I'm saying?

1026
00:48:21,817 --> 00:48:24,987
I want an exhausted man.
That's what I want.

1027
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:26,488
I want an exhausted man.

1028
00:48:26,572 --> 00:48:29,700
I want to bring my boyfriend
to a party and go, "That's my boyfriend."

1029
00:48:29,783 --> 00:48:30,992
And he goes… [sobs]

1030
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:33,370
[audience laughs]

1031
00:48:36,915 --> 00:48:38,375
"I love her."

1032
00:48:38,458 --> 00:48:40,293
[audience laughs]

1033
00:48:40,377 --> 00:48:41,712
I want an exhausted man

1034
00:48:41,795 --> 00:48:44,422
'cause if he's tired, he can't go nowhere!

1035
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:46,467
I was thinking to myself,

1036
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:48,802
"How do I get my exhausted man?

1037
00:48:48,885 --> 00:48:50,678
How?"

1038
00:48:53,098 --> 00:48:54,390
And I figured it was like,

1039
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:56,810
"Okay, I'll meet someone
the old fashioned way,

1040
00:48:56,893 --> 00:48:59,562
I'll get off the apps.
I'll meet them in person at a bar."

1041
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:01,440
So… I'm in this bar,

1042
00:49:01,523 --> 00:49:02,898
I'm talking to this guy.

1043
00:49:02,983 --> 00:49:05,318
He goes, "Hey, my name's Dave.

1044
00:49:05,402 --> 00:49:07,570
I'm really into books right now."

1045
00:49:08,488 --> 00:49:11,157
[audience laughs]

1046
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:15,912
So I said, "Okay, Dave, uh,

1047
00:49:15,995 --> 00:49:17,747
what kind of books are you into?"

1048
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:20,375
And he said, "The ones
that are really descriptive

1049
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:22,377
and paint a picture in your mind."

1050
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:25,797
So I said, "So a book?"

1051
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,882
[audience laughs]

1052
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,802
I can't fuck a dummy.

1053
00:49:29,885 --> 00:49:33,680
So I start flirting with
the bartender and he goes,

1054
00:49:33,763 --> 00:49:35,848
"Hey, my name's Benny.

1055
00:49:35,932 --> 00:49:37,975
You know, like 'Benny and the Jets'."

1056
00:49:39,687 --> 00:49:42,938
I was like,
"I've heard the name Benny before.

1057
00:49:43,023 --> 00:49:45,942
I didn't need the qualifier.
Do you know what a book is?"

1058
00:49:46,025 --> 00:49:48,237
He was like, "I do."
I was like, "You'll do."

1059
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,655
So…

1060
00:49:50,738 --> 00:49:52,907
I was staying in the hotel above the bar

1061
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,868
'cause convenience is what? Key.

1062
00:49:54,952 --> 00:49:56,870
So…

1063
00:49:56,953 --> 00:49:58,913
he comes up after his shift,

1064
00:49:58,997 --> 00:50:00,748
he knock-knocks on the door.

1065
00:50:00,832 --> 00:50:05,420
I open the door and he's standing there
holding a bowl of chicken.

1066
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:07,338
Not a bowl of fried chicken.

1067
00:50:07,422 --> 00:50:11,258
Because that would be
a whole conversation, you know?

1068
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:15,013
I'd be like, "Benny, I don't know you
well enough for this to be funny."

1069
00:50:15,097 --> 00:50:17,265
[audience laughs]

1070
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:26,817
But it was a bowl of grilled chicken.

1071
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,735
So I said, "Benny,

1072
00:50:28,818 --> 00:50:31,655
why do you have a bowl
of grilled chicken?"

1073
00:50:31,738 --> 00:50:33,323
And he said, "Protein."

1074
00:50:33,407 --> 00:50:35,117
[audience laughs]

1075
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,410
Which, I mean, is an answer, you know.

1076
00:50:38,578 --> 00:50:41,372
But it was not the answer
I was searching for.

1077
00:50:41,457 --> 00:50:43,958
So I said,
"Benny, put your chicken on the desk.

1078
00:50:44,042 --> 00:50:46,920
You can't put it on the nightstand, no."

1079
00:50:47,003 --> 00:50:49,422
I'd be riding him, being like, "Protein."

1080
00:50:49,505 --> 00:50:51,633
[audience laughs]

1081
00:50:51,717 --> 00:50:53,008
And that's not the protein

1082
00:50:53,093 --> 00:50:54,635
<i>I </i>was searching for.

1083
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:57,597
[audience laughs]

1084
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,057
So we're hooking up.

1085
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:00,683
I'm slobbing on that knob.

1086
00:51:00,767 --> 00:51:02,852
I'm sucking his dick and…

1087
00:51:03,853 --> 00:51:07,065
I get him semi-hard and I was like,
"Hey, quick, put it in."

1088
00:51:07,148 --> 00:51:08,900
Because if he puts it in semi-hard

1089
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:11,402
you can do kegels
to help him stand at attention.

1090
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:14,072
Also, you feel like a claw machine.

1091
00:51:14,155 --> 00:51:16,992
[audience laughs]

1092
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,170
What a dumb fucking joke.

1093
00:51:28,878 --> 00:51:31,088
So then Benny's on top of me
and I was like,

1094
00:51:31,172 --> 00:51:33,090
"Hey, choke me real quick."

1095
00:51:33,175 --> 00:51:35,218
'Cause I'm an adult and I wanted to cum.

1096
00:51:35,302 --> 00:51:36,512
So…

1097
00:51:38,347 --> 00:51:39,763
Benny says, "Okay."

1098
00:51:39,848 --> 00:51:41,725
And he starts to choke me.

1099
00:51:41,808 --> 00:51:45,478
And I realize he's nowhere inside of me.

1100
00:51:45,562 --> 00:51:49,315
He is just smashing his
semi flaccid dick into my thigh.

1101
00:51:50,233 --> 00:51:52,318
So I looked up at him and I said,

1102
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:55,113
"But you're just killing me."

1103
00:51:55,197 --> 00:51:58,032
[audience laughs]

1104
00:52:08,877 --> 00:52:12,463
And if you've never seen the face
of a man who's trying to kill you

1105
00:52:12,547 --> 00:52:15,050
who did not intend to try to kill you,

1106
00:52:15,133 --> 00:52:16,635
it's pretty funny.

1107
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,428
So then Benny says, "Flip over."

1108
00:52:19,512 --> 00:52:21,013
And I was like, "Oh, I get it.

1109
00:52:21,097 --> 00:52:23,433
I wouldn't want to look
at my victim either."

1110
00:52:23,517 --> 00:52:25,643
[audience laughs]

1111
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:29,982
So then Benny's behind me and
he utters a sentence I'll never forget.

1112
00:52:30,065 --> 00:52:31,567
He goes, "Ah, geez.

1113
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:34,277
It's like a real wet noodle back here."

1114
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,112
[audience laughs]

1115
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:47,957
A sentence every gal wants to hear.

1116
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:50,543
So I said, "You know what?

1117
00:52:50,627 --> 00:52:53,463
Noodles go great with chicken,
Benny, you gotta jet."

1118
00:52:53,547 --> 00:52:54,505
So…

1119
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:56,675
[audience cheers and applauds]

1120
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:03,097
…I'm back on the apps.

1121
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,017
And I got to say,

1122
00:53:05,142 --> 00:53:08,562
you gentlemen are so poorly behaved.

1123
00:53:08,645 --> 00:53:11,313
I don't understand
why you're still sending dick pics.

1124
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:13,107
I thought we had an understanding.

1125
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,733
We don't fucking want them.

1126
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:16,737
Does anyone here still send dick pics?

1127
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:18,028
[man] Whoo!

1128
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:20,448
[audience laughs]

1129
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:31,167
Can I ask you a question?

1130
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:32,793
Are you a homosexual?

1131
00:53:32,877 --> 00:53:34,128
What gives it away?

1132
00:53:34,212 --> 00:53:36,172
[laughs]

1133
00:53:36,255 --> 00:53:39,675
Well, you're sending it
to people who want it, right?

1134
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:40,927
With consent.

1135
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:44,013
Really? You're like,
"Do you consent to looking at my dick?"

1136
00:53:44,097 --> 00:53:45,682
Is that like--

1137
00:53:45,765 --> 00:53:46,892
It's in their profile.

1138
00:53:46,975 --> 00:53:48,058
Really?

1139
00:53:48,142 --> 00:53:51,020
If they accept like
forward pics immediately or not.

1140
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:52,563
The gays are onto something.

1141
00:53:52,647 --> 00:53:53,982
[audience laughs]

1142
00:53:54,065 --> 00:53:55,275
What the fuck?

1143
00:53:55,358 --> 00:53:57,277
We need that.

1144
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,653
Nobody's ever asked me a goddamn question.

1145
00:53:59,737 --> 00:54:02,448
They're like, "Look at my fucking dick."

1146
00:54:02,532 --> 00:54:04,200
"Here's a mop for reference."

1147
00:54:04,283 --> 00:54:05,952
Like, what the fu--

1148
00:54:06,035 --> 00:54:07,578
[laughs]

1149
00:54:17,922 --> 00:54:19,757
But really, I don't want a dick pic.

1150
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,885
I find them useless, okay?

1151
00:54:21,968 --> 00:54:25,555
They're not helpful. It's like sending
someone IKEA instructions, okay?

1152
00:54:26,932 --> 00:54:30,477
Also, if you've seen four dicks,
you've seen them all.

1153
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,187
Big, tiny, curved, and straight.

1154
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:33,813
That is it. Four.

1155
00:54:34,897 --> 00:54:37,733
I was in Buffalo, New York,
and this girl screamed at me.

1156
00:54:37,817 --> 00:54:39,527
She said, "What about skinny?"

1157
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:42,822
And I was like,
"Bitch that's your journey, okay."

1158
00:54:46,075 --> 00:54:48,995
I have never seen a skinny dick.

1159
00:54:49,078 --> 00:54:52,665
What are you out here fucking pencils?
What's wrong with you?

1160
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:54,625
Is your boyfriend's name Ticonderoga.

1161
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,460
I have never seen…

1162
00:54:58,547 --> 00:55:00,173
a skinny dick.

1163
00:55:00,257 --> 00:55:02,133
And if you didn't get that last joke,

1164
00:55:02,217 --> 00:55:04,052
it was just a more specific pencil.

1165
00:55:04,135 --> 00:55:06,428
[audience laughs and claps]

1166
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:10,725
But there are four:
big, tiny, curved, and straight.

1167
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:13,310
And there's variations
to the algorithm.

1168
00:55:16,605 --> 00:55:19,942
So you're gonna have big and straight,
big and curved, big and tiny.

1169
00:55:20,027 --> 00:55:22,112
What a terrible surprise.

1170
00:55:22,195 --> 00:55:24,238
He pulls down his pants and you're like,

1171
00:55:24,322 --> 00:55:26,365
"Ooh baby, he gonna blow my back out."

1172
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:28,910
And then he's fucking you,
and you're like, "Huh?

1173
00:55:28,993 --> 00:55:30,578
I could be doing my taxes."

1174
00:55:34,165 --> 00:55:36,710
And then there's tiny and straight,
tiny and big.

1175
00:55:36,793 --> 00:55:39,170
What a lovely surprise.

1176
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:42,007
He pulls down his pants
and you're like, "Ugh whatever."

1177
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:44,175
Then afterwards you
phone a friend and say,

1178
00:55:44,258 --> 00:55:45,927
"Girl, he bruised my cervix."

1179
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:47,720
[audience laughs]

1180
00:55:47,803 --> 00:55:50,223
A lot of you are like, "What's a cervix?"

1181
00:55:50,307 --> 00:55:52,017
[audience laughs]

1182
00:55:53,893 --> 00:55:56,103
The worst one though is tiny and curved.

1183
00:55:56,187 --> 00:55:58,565
Ah, yuck! Woof! Ugh!

1184
00:55:59,482 --> 00:56:02,318
Tiny and curved? Ew!

1185
00:56:02,402 --> 00:56:05,780
Oh, gross. That's like fucking
a hanger and that's for later.

1186
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:08,282
[audience laughs and cheers]

1187
00:56:16,833 --> 00:56:19,835
Yeah, that was an abortion joke!

1188
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:22,255
[audience cheers]

1189
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:26,760
That I disguised as a dick joke!

1190
00:56:26,843 --> 00:56:28,928
And I know some of you didn't like it.

1191
00:56:29,012 --> 00:56:30,680
[laughs]

1192
00:56:30,763 --> 00:56:34,350
To you I say, tonight donate to
your local planned parenthood or ACLU.

1193
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:37,103
[audience cheers and applauds]

1194
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:43,985
I won't end on an abortion joke

1195
00:56:44,068 --> 00:56:45,653
because I was raised right.

1196
00:56:45,737 --> 00:56:47,530
[audience laughs]

1197
00:56:49,698 --> 00:56:51,910
So I spend a lot of time in airports

1198
00:56:51,993 --> 00:56:53,118
and on airplanes.

1199
00:56:53,202 --> 00:56:55,538
And I don't want
to generalize or stereotype,

1200
00:56:55,622 --> 00:56:58,332
I don't see that for myself.
It's not me. But…

1201
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:01,920
All male flight attendants are gay.

1202
00:57:02,003 --> 00:57:03,797
All of them.

1203
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:06,507
Every single last one.

1204
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:09,885
You're like, "Ooh excuse me,
can I have a pillow?" And they go…

1205
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:14,890
[audience laughs]

1206
00:57:25,443 --> 00:57:28,153
You're just like, "Excuse me,

1207
00:57:28,237 --> 00:57:30,365
did you just snap at me?"

1208
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:35,077
It's almost as if someone said to them
when they were a little boy,

1209
00:57:35,162 --> 00:57:38,247
"Baby, you too much for this world,
you got to go to the sky."

1210
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:40,208
[audience applause]

1211
00:57:51,135 --> 00:57:54,513
So I was on this flight once
and I was wearing a nameplate necklace,

1212
00:57:54,597 --> 00:57:57,308
it says my name, Nicole,
it's only six letters long,

1213
00:57:57,392 --> 00:58:00,018
but it takes up my whole chest.

1214
00:58:00,102 --> 00:58:02,313
My best friend had it made
for me in Brooklyn

1215
00:58:02,397 --> 00:58:05,275
and the jeweler said,
"Are you sure you want it that big?"

1216
00:58:05,358 --> 00:58:08,068
She said,
"Yes, I have a very tacky friend."

1217
00:58:08,152 --> 00:58:10,070
[audience laughs]

1218
00:58:12,448 --> 00:58:14,575
So I was wearing this necklace on a flight

1219
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:16,285
and the flight attendant says,

1220
00:58:16,368 --> 00:58:17,912
"Oh, well you must be Nicole."

1221
00:58:17,995 --> 00:58:19,663
I said, "Yeah, my necklace."

1222
00:58:19,747 --> 00:58:22,458
He goes, "Yeah, but I also
recognize you from <i>Girl Code</i>

1223
00:58:22,542 --> 00:58:24,168
I think you're very funny."

1224
00:58:24,252 --> 00:58:26,045
And it is always so nice

1225
00:58:26,128 --> 00:58:27,963
when someone says they like your work

1226
00:58:28,047 --> 00:58:30,425
and think you're funny
'cause often you're like,

1227
00:58:30,508 --> 00:58:33,260
"I don't know if anybody likes me
or thinks I'm funny."

1228
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,388
And according to Reddit, they don't.

1229
00:58:35,472 --> 00:58:37,598
[audience laughs]

1230
00:58:37,682 --> 00:58:40,602
So the flight attendant says to me,
"Do you want a drink?"

1231
00:58:40,685 --> 00:58:43,020
I said, "Yes, please.
May I have a vodka soda?"

1232
00:58:43,103 --> 00:58:44,897
And he said, "I got you.

1233
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:47,025
I've got you. I've got you."

1234
00:58:47,108 --> 00:58:49,277
I was like, "Then go get it."

1235
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,362
[audience laughs]

1236
00:58:54,615 --> 00:58:56,575
What are we doing?

1237
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:00,580
So he brings me three of those
little airplane bottles of vodka

1238
00:59:00,663 --> 00:59:01,872
and a splash of soda.

1239
00:59:01,957 --> 00:59:03,415
And I said, "Game on."

1240
00:59:04,417 --> 00:59:07,878
So I drink that, he comes back around,
he says, "Do you want another?"

1241
00:59:07,962 --> 00:59:09,380
And I said, "Yes, please."

1242
00:59:10,965 --> 00:59:14,052
So he brings three more Nossa
and I say, "We're doing it."

1243
00:59:14,135 --> 00:59:16,637
[audience laughs]

1244
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:20,182
So I drink that, he comes back around
and says, "Do you want another?"

1245
00:59:20,267 --> 00:59:22,977
And I said, "I don't know how to say no."

1246
00:59:23,102 --> 00:59:24,895
[audience laughs]

1247
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:29,525
So he brings me three more.

1248
00:59:29,608 --> 00:59:32,195
If you nice people are counting along,

1249
00:59:32,278 --> 00:59:36,032
that is nine of those
airplane bottles of vodka

1250
00:59:36,115 --> 00:59:38,325
on a four-and-a-half-hour red-eye.

1251
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,412
[audience laughs]

1252
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:44,915
Everyone is sleeping

1253
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:46,960
and I'm the drunkest I've ever been.

1254
00:59:47,043 --> 00:59:49,378
[audience laughs and claps]

1255
00:59:50,838 --> 00:59:52,965
I was sitting in my seat and I was like,

1256
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:55,133
"What if I roll around in the aisle?"

1257
00:59:55,217 --> 00:59:57,970
[audience laughs]

1258
00:59:59,597 --> 01:00:04,893
Imagine I got up to lay down
to roll in the aisle.

1259
01:00:04,977 --> 01:00:07,313
What would that call to Ground Control be?

1260
01:00:07,397 --> 01:00:11,192
"We got to land this plane,
this big Black bitch won't sit down."

1261
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:12,610
But then I was like,

1262
01:00:12,693 --> 01:00:16,405
[slurs] "I know what I will do.
I will not roll in the aisle,

1263
01:00:16,488 --> 01:00:18,825
I will watch <i>Back to the Future.</i>"

1264
01:00:18,908 --> 01:00:20,785
[audience laughs]

1265
01:00:21,827 --> 01:00:24,413
So I watched <i>Back to the Future</i>

1266
01:00:24,497 --> 01:00:26,582
like I had never seen it before.

1267
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:30,545
I was knee-slapping and tee-hee-ing.

1268
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:33,923
I was three inches from the monitor.

1269
01:00:34,007 --> 01:00:35,842
[audience laughs]

1270
01:00:39,845 --> 01:00:40,972
I was like,

1271
01:00:41,055 --> 01:00:43,808
"Marty and Doc's age difference
is pretty wild."

1272
01:00:43,892 --> 01:00:46,060
[audience laughs]

1273
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:48,395
"And is Lorraine ever okay?"

1274
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,230
And… [laughs]

1275
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:53,860
And then we land at JFK and it's 7:00 am

1276
01:00:53,943 --> 01:00:55,778
and Shake Shack is open.

1277
01:00:57,613 --> 01:01:00,700
So I say out loud to no one,

1278
01:01:00,783 --> 01:01:02,952
"Jesus loves his little baby."

1279
01:01:03,035 --> 01:01:07,290
[audience laughs and cheers]

1280
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:15,130
'Cause I thought I'd been blessed. And…

1281
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:18,843
I stumble up to the counter
and I place my order

1282
01:01:18,927 --> 01:01:20,720
and the guy behind the counter said,

1283
01:01:20,803 --> 01:01:22,263
"Well, you must be Nicole."

1284
01:01:22,347 --> 01:01:25,600
I responded with,
"You know who I am because I'm famous."

1285
01:01:25,683 --> 01:01:28,435
[audience laughs]

1286
01:01:35,443 --> 01:01:37,403
Famous people don't have to do that.

1287
01:01:37,487 --> 01:01:38,822
[audience laughs]

1288
01:01:38,905 --> 01:01:42,158
Also, he could read my necklace.

1289
01:01:42,242 --> 01:01:45,537
So he gives me my food to go.
His choice, not mine.

1290
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:48,163
[audience laughs]

1291
01:01:48,247 --> 01:01:51,417
And I'm stumbling through JFK
with this bag of food, I was like,

1292
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:54,128
"Oh my God, I'll go to the bathroom,
I got to pee."

1293
01:01:54,212 --> 01:01:57,590
So I bring my food with me to the bathroom

1294
01:01:57,673 --> 01:01:59,592
and I start peeing.

1295
01:01:59,675 --> 01:02:02,095
You know, let's get real,
I'm taking a shit.

1296
01:02:02,178 --> 01:02:03,805
[audience laughs]

1297
01:02:03,888 --> 01:02:05,598
And as I was shitting, I was like,

1298
01:02:05,682 --> 01:02:08,100
"Ooh, that burger smells so good."

1299
01:02:08,183 --> 01:02:10,060
[audience laughs]

1300
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,315
So I start to eat it.

1301
01:02:14,398 --> 01:02:16,400
[audience laughs]

1302
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:18,068
I'm single!

1303
01:02:18,152 --> 01:02:20,488
[audience laughs]

1304
01:02:20,572 --> 01:02:22,782
And then I realize what I'm doing

1305
01:02:22,865 --> 01:02:24,700
so I start crying.

1306
01:02:24,783 --> 01:02:26,702
[audience laughs]

1307
01:02:26,785 --> 01:02:31,790
So now I'm crying,
eating a burger, taking a shit.

1308
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:33,125
And I thought to myself,

1309
01:02:33,208 --> 01:02:36,753
"I know what I'll do to make myself
feel better, I sing myself a song."

1310
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:39,048
[audience laughs]

1311
01:02:43,427 --> 01:02:48,933
So then I out loud started to sing
"Somewhere Over the Rainbow".

1312
01:02:49,017 --> 01:02:53,603
As I'm crying, eating a burger,
taking a shit.

1313
01:02:53,687 --> 01:02:57,065
And then I look down
and I see a pair of feet.

1314
01:02:57,150 --> 01:03:00,235
[audience laughs]

1315
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:03,613
And instead of shutting
the whole thing down,

1316
01:03:03,697 --> 01:03:05,700
I knocked on the partition.

1317
01:03:05,783 --> 01:03:07,868
[audience laughs]

1318
01:03:07,952 --> 01:03:11,955
I said, "Excuse me,

1319
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:13,790
I'm not normally like this."

1320
01:03:13,875 --> 01:03:15,960
[audience laughs]

1321
01:03:20,715 --> 01:03:24,927
And then that woman, being
a normal human adult woman, said nothing.

1322
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:27,930
[audience laughs]

1323
01:03:31,475 --> 01:03:35,062
And then I realize
this bathroom is filled with women.

1324
01:03:35,145 --> 01:03:37,022
[audience laughs]

1325
01:03:37,105 --> 01:03:40,400
They're all moving very slowly.

1326
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:44,363
They're like, "I don't know
what the fuck is behind that door.

1327
01:03:45,573 --> 01:03:49,368
No, I don't know what
kind of monster that is.

1328
01:03:49,452 --> 01:03:53,788
Gloria, I will miss my flight
to see whatever the fuck that is!"

1329
01:03:53,873 --> 01:03:56,042
[audience laughs]

1330
01:03:58,752 --> 01:04:01,547
So I said out loud
to Gloria and her friends, I said,

1331
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:04,717
"Hey, I'm okay."

1332
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:10,430
And honestly, this last year and a half
has been pretty shitty

1333
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:12,808
but I think we're all gonna be okay.

1334
01:04:12,892 --> 01:04:15,227
Thank you so much for fucking coming out.

1335
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:17,062
-[audience applause]
-Truly.

1336
01:04:17,145 --> 01:04:19,440
Thank you so much. Have a good night.

1337
01:04:19,523 --> 01:04:21,775
[audience cheers and applauds]

1338
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:24,445
[theme music plays]

1339
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,662
{\an8}<i>I need to get fucked.</i>

1340
01:04:41,587 --> 01:04:43,672
<i>I don't need anything, I'm alive!</i>

1341
01:05:11,617 --> 01:05:13,660
{\an8}<i>If you don't give me, what the fuck?</i>

1342
01:05:16,747 --> 01:05:18,540
{\an8}<i>Ooh, I love it!</i>
