[sighs]

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,033
Sorry, I'm just
a little nervous.

9
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:53,266
It's my first time.

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,133
Online dating, I mean.

11
00:00:56,233 --> 00:00:58,166
It's a little awkward, honestly.

12
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,433
She said I didn't listen.

13
00:00:59,567 --> 00:01:01,133
I mean, what does that
even mean?

14
00:01:01,266 --> 00:01:04,633
Well, communication
can be complicated--

15
00:01:04,767 --> 00:01:06,266
She said I didn't hear her.

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,767
"Hear her."

17
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,700
I mean, if it didn't
always register,

18
00:01:09,834 --> 00:01:11,734
it's just because
I've heard it all before.

19
00:01:16,967 --> 00:01:18,900
Ho, ho, ho!

20
00:01:20,233 --> 00:01:21,867
Merry Christmas!

21
00:01:37,567 --> 00:01:39,567
You know, your picture
did not do you justice.

22
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,233
Oh, well, thank you.

23
00:01:42,367 --> 00:01:44,800
And a doctor, no less.

24
00:01:44,934 --> 00:01:47,000
An eye doctor, an optometrist.

25
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:48,500
As smart as you are pretty.

26
00:01:48,633 --> 00:01:49,467
[chuckles]

27
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,300
But I've got to ask,

28
00:01:51,433 --> 00:01:53,600
why the dating app?

29
00:01:53,734 --> 00:01:55,500
Honestly,

30
00:01:55,633 --> 00:01:57,367
my girlfriend set it up for me,

31
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,934
and it's my first time,

32
00:01:59,066 --> 00:02:01,533
and probably the last.

33
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:03,200
[laughing]

34
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:04,867
What about you?

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,900
I...

36
00:02:06,033 --> 00:02:07,333
You know, I'm just,

37
00:02:07,467 --> 00:02:08,767
I'm so busy at the restaurant,

38
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,033
and it's hard, you know,
to meet people.

39
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,633
You know, I saw your show.

40
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:15,734
Oh boy.

41
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,333
What was I making?

42
00:02:18,467 --> 00:02:21,033
Some kind of
Continental Sizzler.

43
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:22,233
Okay, yeah.

44
00:02:22,367 --> 00:02:23,333
Yeah.

45
00:02:23,467 --> 00:02:25,066
-It looked really good.
-It is, it is,

46
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,000
and you know what,
the best thing,

47
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:26,834
it's so simple to make.

48
00:02:26,967 --> 00:02:28,033
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

49
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:30,100
I think that I am going to lead

50
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,166
with my strong suit

51
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,700
and cook for you sometime.

52
00:02:32,834 --> 00:02:34,767
In case I wasn't clear,

53
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,867
that was me
asking for another date.

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
-No, I... I got that.
-You did?

55
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:41,066
-[laughs] Yeah.
-And?

56
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,467
Yeah.

57
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,300
-Okay.
-That sounds good.

58
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:46,500
Good.

[beeps car alarm on]

61
00:03:11,433 --> 00:03:12,967
Good morning, Keisha.

62
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,000
Morning, Sarah.

63
00:03:16,033 --> 00:03:18,233
How was your weekend?

64
00:03:18,367 --> 00:03:19,133
Spill all the beans,

65
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:20,767
don't spare any details.

66
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,467
Okay, do not get too excited,

67
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,400
all right?

68
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:26,266
I don't know
if I'm ready to date yet,

69
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,100
but after a lot of coffee,

70
00:03:29,233 --> 00:03:32,000
and a lot of disappointments,

71
00:03:32,133 --> 00:03:33,934
I may have met someone.

72
00:03:34,066 --> 00:03:35,467
A guy from the dating app?

73
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,233
Maybe.

74
00:03:37,367 --> 00:03:38,400
Okay, yeah, you were right.

75
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,800
Am I hearing this correctly,

76
00:03:41,934 --> 00:03:43,934
Sarah Levin on a dating app?

77
00:03:44,066 --> 00:03:44,934
Yeah,

78
00:03:45,066 --> 00:03:46,033
what's the big surprise?

79
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:49,133
It's just... so not you.

80
00:03:49,266 --> 00:03:51,133
Well, maybe you don't know me

81
00:03:51,266 --> 00:03:52,967
as well as you think
you know me.

82
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,734
Maybe I don't either.

83
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:56,967
Are you being profound
or you're just confused?

84
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,066
I think I'm just
profoundly confused.

85
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,433
-Me too.
-Yeah.

86
00:03:59,567 --> 00:04:01,133
Okay, I want to hear
about this date.

87
00:04:01,266 --> 00:04:02,100
Come on.

88
00:04:02,233 --> 00:04:03,467
Uh, okay, well,

89
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,200
there were a lot
of "never-gonna-happens" there,

90
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,700
and then the last one...

91
00:04:08,834 --> 00:04:10,500
might actually be a keeper.

92
00:04:10,633 --> 00:04:11,700
Ooh...

93
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,266
does the keeper have a name?

94
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,700
He does, actually.

95
00:04:15,834 --> 00:04:17,767
His name is Nigel Templeton.

96
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,800
Apparently,
he's this well-known chef.

97
00:04:20,934 --> 00:04:22,500
Yeah, I've seen him on TV.
I love that guy.

98
00:04:22,633 --> 00:04:24,166
Well, before you
and the top chef

99
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,567
run off together,

100
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,166
you wanna come take a look
behind the plastic curtain?

101
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,533
Hmm?
Tell me what you think?

102
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:31,133
Well, that sounds exciting.

103
00:04:31,266 --> 00:04:32,367
Come on.

104
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,967
Well, as you can see,
everything is going--

everything is going according--

-Jimmy!
-[turns off tool]

109
00:04:39,734 --> 00:04:40,900
You want to give it a rest?

110
00:04:41,934 --> 00:04:42,767
Oops.
[laughs awkwardly]

111
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,800
Hey.

112
00:04:43,934 --> 00:04:44,900
Didn't mean
to blow the moment.

113
00:04:45,033 --> 00:04:46,800
You didn't blow anything.

114
00:04:46,934 --> 00:04:50,000
This is really incredible,
you guys.

115
00:04:50,133 --> 00:04:52,200
Everything should be done
by the last night of Hanukkah.

116
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,500
Wow.

117
00:04:53,633 --> 00:04:56,033
You always pull through,
you know that?

118
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,667
Of course.

119
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,000
[chuckles]

120
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:00,400
Okay, the moment is over,
back to work.

121
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:01,734
[Sarah] Okay.

122
00:05:01,867 --> 00:05:02,700
Um, thanks, you guys.

123
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:04,867
[tools resume whirring]

124
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,567
Yeah, here.
I'll help you.

125
00:05:08,033 --> 00:05:09,266
Two in the morning,

126
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,834
and then two at night, okay?

127
00:05:11,967 --> 00:05:13,967
Thank you for coming in.

128
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,000
Adam Lesser is coming in.

129
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:18,100
You're kidding.

130
00:05:18,233 --> 00:05:20,400
He lost his glasses.

131
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:21,800
Says he needs another pair.

132
00:05:21,934 --> 00:05:22,667
Again?

133
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,767
Mm-hmm.

134
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,533
I think he's got a thing
for his eye doctor.

135
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:34,433
A little Christmas,
a little Hanukkah.

136
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:35,767
Looks really nice.

137
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm all about the Christmas.

138
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:37,967
And I'm all about Hanukkah--

139
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,266
[together] So we compromised.

140
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,233
Ah! Jinx.

141
00:05:41,367 --> 00:05:43,133
Pow!

142
00:05:43,266 --> 00:05:44,567
Well, I'm both,
so it works for me.

143
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,266
How can I help you, Adam?

144
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,767
I know this is getting old...

145
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,767
Mm-hmm?

146
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,200
but I can't find my glasses.

147
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,200
Have you checked your face?

148
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,567
Uh, these?

149
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,900
These are my spares.

150
00:05:55,033 --> 00:05:55,867
Uh-huh.

151
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,400
You seem to have
a lot of spares.

152
00:05:58,667 --> 00:06:00,834
You're not buying this,
are you?

153
00:06:00,967 --> 00:06:03,433
No, but
it's very entertaining.

154
00:06:03,567 --> 00:06:04,433
[chuckles]

155
00:06:04,567 --> 00:06:06,100
Well, it might be easier

156
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:08,200
if I just ask you out.

157
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,767
Or I could, you know,
just keep buying glasses

158
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,467
until you run out of lenses.

159
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,233
No, no, um...

160
00:06:20,367 --> 00:06:21,800
how about we start with coffee,

161
00:06:21,934 --> 00:06:23,133
and, uh,

162
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:24,300
see where that goes?

163
00:06:24,433 --> 00:06:26,667
[laughs in shock]
Yeah, okay.

164
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,800
Coffee.

165
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,367
Coffee would be great.

166
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,633
Okay, great.

167
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,934
Okay. Coffee.

168
00:06:35,066 --> 00:06:36,367
Coffee.

169
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:41,133
[laughing] Okay.

170
00:06:52,934 --> 00:06:54,000
Uh, hey,

171
00:06:54,133 --> 00:06:55,133
see you at the meeting tomorrow.

172
00:06:55,266 --> 00:06:56,266
Yes, you will.

173
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,800
9:00 a.m. sharp,

174
00:06:58,934 --> 00:07:00,433
or I should say 8:55, for you.

175
00:07:00,567 --> 00:07:02,333
-[message alert chimes]
-8:55, sharp.

176
00:07:02,467 --> 00:07:03,533
-Don't be late.
-I won't be late.

177
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:04,734
Got a lot to cover.

178
00:07:04,867 --> 00:07:05,834
[gasps]

179
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,567
It's Nigel.

180
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,834
Ah.

181
00:07:08,967 --> 00:07:12,166
Does Nigel know about, uh,
our friend, Adam?

182
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,934
No, because I didn't even
know about Adam.

183
00:07:16,066 --> 00:07:17,266
It's a complete surprise.

184
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,734
I feel like I'm putting off
this weird newly-single vibe.

185
00:07:20,867 --> 00:07:22,433
It's not so "newly," Levin.

186
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,033
It's been four months.

187
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,133
Right, but, you know,

188
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:28,700
Paul and I were together
for a long time.

189
00:07:28,834 --> 00:07:33,133
Four months feels like
a couple days.

190
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:34,734
He didn't deserve you,

191
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:35,867
and if you forget,

192
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,367
I'll be right here
to remind you.

193
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,433
You might
have to remind me a lot.

194
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:42,266
I'm beginning to think

195
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,967
I'm never gonna find
my soulmate.

196
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,467
Here.

197
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,233
Something to lift your spirits.

198
00:07:51,367 --> 00:07:56,400
This right here
is from circa junior high.

199
00:07:56,533 --> 00:07:58,867
-[laughs]
-Okay?

200
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,900
I found it in a box I have
full of Hanukkahs past.

201
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:03,066
I made it for Bubbe Rose.

202
00:08:04,934 --> 00:08:05,800
You made this?

203
00:08:05,934 --> 00:08:06,967
Yeah.

204
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,166
It's beautiful.

205
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,900
Thank you.

206
00:08:10,033 --> 00:08:10,800
Okay.

207
00:08:10,934 --> 00:08:12,600
I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.

208
00:08:12,734 --> 00:08:13,867
Bye.

209
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,567
[singing]
♪ Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel... ♪

210
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,033
Hmm.

211
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:52,533
[sighs]

212
00:08:57,767 --> 00:09:00,633
Hey, Bubs.

213
00:09:00,767 --> 00:09:02,467
You know, things are looking up.

214
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,133
I actually met someone.

215
00:09:05,266 --> 00:09:06,333
[chuckles]

216
00:09:06,467 --> 00:09:08,333
Well, a couple of someones.

217
00:09:08,467 --> 00:09:12,533
They seem a little more
accidental than bashert,

218
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:14,400
but you met Grandpa
on a trolley,

219
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:17,967
so who knows, right?

220
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:25,233
[sighs] What I wouldn't give
for another hug.

221
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,333
[woman] Hi, Sarah!

222
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:40,100
Oh, hey!
How are you?

223
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,800
So the Ball
is right around the corner,

224
00:09:43,934 --> 00:09:46,200
and we still have a lot to do.

225
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,233
Are we really going to call
our annual fundraiser

226
00:09:48,367 --> 00:09:49,667
"The Mazel Ball?

227
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,300
What's wrong with "Mazel"?

228
00:09:51,433 --> 00:09:53,066
It means "luck".

229
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,133
[chuckles]
Well, good luck with that.

230
00:09:55,266 --> 00:09:56,633
The invitations
have been sent out,

231
00:09:56,767 --> 00:09:58,133
the banners have been ordered.

232
00:09:58,266 --> 00:09:59,800
It's a lock, Myra.
Let it go.

233
00:09:59,934 --> 00:10:01,600
I like the name.

234
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,500
Okay, so...

235
00:10:05,633 --> 00:10:08,133
as the manager of the hotel--

236
00:10:08,266 --> 00:10:09,166
I was able to get us
free parking--

237
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,533
Whoo!

238
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:11,767
[clears throat]

239
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,433
And the band will be free.

240
00:10:14,567 --> 00:10:15,333
So--

241
00:10:15,467 --> 00:10:18,166
I know that Jacob
is your brother,

242
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,667
but a band of CPAs?
Seriously?

243
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,033
The Bean Counters are not
just a garage band, Myra.

244
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,633
They also performed
at the Weinbergs' bar mitzvah--

245
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:28,867
And the Newmans'
anniversary party.

246
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,967
Thank you, Tom.

247
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,266
Who are now divorcing.

248
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,367
I don't think it was the band.

249
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,667
[laughs]

250
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,633
[dryly] Ha, ha, ha.

251
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:35,967
You're always Team Sarah,
Daniel.

252
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,367
Yes, I am.

253
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,000
[emphatically] Yes, I am.

254
00:10:40,033 --> 00:10:42,033
I'm on that team, too.

255
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,200
Okay.

256
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,133
Let's talk about the menu.

257
00:10:46,266 --> 00:10:47,533
Whatever.

258
00:10:49,467 --> 00:10:51,700
Hey, are you okay?

259
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:53,800
Yeah, totally.

260
00:10:53,934 --> 00:10:55,433
It's just, you know...

261
00:10:55,567 --> 00:10:56,900
it's the first time

262
00:10:57,033 --> 00:10:59,033
Paul has come
to one of these meetings

263
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,133
since we broke up,

264
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:02,600
and I was gonna marry that guy,

265
00:11:02,734 --> 00:11:05,934
Now he's just
someone I run into sometimes.

266
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:07,533
I think this is my cue

267
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,033
to remind you
he didn't deserve you.

268
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,867
Oh, boy.

269
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,066
Hold that thought?

270
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,200
Sarah?

271
00:11:17,033 --> 00:11:18,867
Uh...

272
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,767
Can you give us a moment?

273
00:11:22,533 --> 00:11:23,567
Yeah, sure.

274
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,133
Thanks.

275
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:31,066
I don't want things
to be weird between us.

276
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,834
Then let's not
make it weird, okay?

277
00:11:33,967 --> 00:11:37,767
I moved on
and so should you.

278
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,066
I just hope
we can still be friends.

279
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,500
We will be.

280
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,066
Okay.

281
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,500
Eventually.

282
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:45,967
And they're coming
around the final corner,

283
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,533
into the home stretch!

284
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:49,133
Oh! Zoey!

285
00:11:49,266 --> 00:11:51,266
The undefeated champion!

286
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,367
Hey, Zo, do forks go
on the left or the right,

287
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,600
I can never remember.

288
00:11:54,734 --> 00:11:56,600
Forks go on the left,
with the salad fork beside it,

289
00:11:56,734 --> 00:11:57,667
and knives and spoons
go on the right.

290
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,533
Ah, got it.

291
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:00,100
She has a Ph.D. in cutlery.

292
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:01,333
I know.

293
00:12:01,467 --> 00:12:04,000
I love you more than
all the stars in the sky.

294
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:05,900
That is a lot of love.

295
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,567
I'm starving.

296
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,333
I don't think
the kugel is done.

297
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:15,567
It smells great.

298
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,934
Looks good to me.

299
00:12:17,066 --> 00:12:19,133
No, I think it needs
ten more minutes in the oven.

300
00:12:19,266 --> 00:12:21,266
Yes, Your Honor.

301
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,333
See, this is what happens
when your mom is a judge.

302
00:12:24,467 --> 00:12:25,867
You get used to being overruled.

303
00:12:28,233 --> 00:12:30,467
Would you care to render
an opinion on the brisket?

304
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,266
Mm, looks good enough to eat.

305
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,467
[Sarah] They met in a courtroom.

306
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,100
Dad was a public defender
at the time.

307
00:12:36,233 --> 00:12:38,300
I lost the case,
but I got the girl.

308
00:12:38,433 --> 00:12:39,200
You certainly did.

309
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:40,467
That's sweet.

310
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,700
[Sarah] They still act
like it's their first date,

311
00:12:42,834 --> 00:12:43,934
and it's been two kids

312
00:12:44,066 --> 00:12:46,166
and 37 years later.

313
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,166
It's gross.

314
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,000
[laughter]

315
00:12:49,133 --> 00:12:49,834
Aunt Sarah?

316
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:50,967
Yeah?

317
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,700
When are we
going to light the Menorah?

318
00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:54,800
As soon as the sun goes down.

319
00:12:54,934 --> 00:12:55,834
Can I light the candles?

320
00:12:56,934 --> 00:12:59,133
How about
we light them together?

I'm thinking
of becoming a Rabbi.

338
00:13:45,967 --> 00:13:46,800
Yeah?

339
00:13:46,934 --> 00:13:48,133
Or a doctor,

340
00:13:48,266 --> 00:13:49,200
or an astronaut.

341
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,600
Those are three
excellent choices.

-Dad?
-Mm-hmm?

00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:55,700

00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:56,934
Hmm, okay.

00:13:57,066 --> 00:13:58,133
-Go for it.
-Yes!

346

Welcome to Zoey's squad
of pinch-hit moms.

347
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:03,800
Ah.

348
00:14:03,934 --> 00:14:04,867
Thank you.

349
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,700
Anytime.

350
00:14:07,867 --> 00:14:10,767
Everybody needs
a little babka.

351
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,767
Aw...

352
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,300
isn't that you
and your grandmother?

353
00:14:13,433 --> 00:14:14,300
Yeah.

354
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:16,100
That's Bubbe Rose.

355
00:14:16,233 --> 00:14:17,300
She was a survivor, you know?

356
00:14:17,433 --> 00:14:18,533
Yeah.

357
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:19,867
And I love
how you use her glasses

358
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,600
for the optical shop's logo.

359
00:14:21,734 --> 00:14:23,400
Well, she's the reason
I became an eye doctor.

360
00:14:23,533 --> 00:14:24,367
Yeah?

361
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,233
Great face.

362
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:27,400
Great heart.

363
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,100
The best heart I ever knew.

364
00:14:29,233 --> 00:14:30,800
Rugelach is in the oven.

Daniel sure acts like
part of the family.

Yeah, well, he is.

369
00:14:42,133 --> 00:14:43,467
He grew up
in the house next door.

370
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,533
His parents split
when he was young,

371
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:48,433
and his mom worked all the time,

372
00:14:48,567 --> 00:14:51,800
so he would just come over
and hang out with Jacob,

373
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:53,367
and suddenly when I was seven,

374
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,800
I had another brother.

375
00:14:54,934 --> 00:14:55,867
[chuckles]

376
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,133
So you guys never...

377
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:00,200
No.

378
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,734
We're just really good friends.

379
00:15:05,533 --> 00:15:06,667
[♪]

380
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,000
[imitating sports commentator]
It's the start

381
00:15:08,133 --> 00:15:09,200
of the Hanukkah Season,

382
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,100
and time for...

383
00:15:11,233 --> 00:15:12,300
[together] Dreidel!

384
00:15:12,433 --> 00:15:14,033
Dreidel, dreidel...

385
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,100
[all imitating echoes]
Dreidel, dreidel...

386
00:15:16,233 --> 00:15:17,333
A hush falls over the crowd--

387
00:15:17,467 --> 00:15:18,967
Hush!

388
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,100
--as Keisha
picks up the dreidel.

389
00:15:20,233 --> 00:15:21,967
The prized newcomer,

390
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,367
no doubt feeling the pressure

391
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,133
of her arrival
in the Big Leagues.

392
00:15:25,266 --> 00:15:28,333
Still, I think she's ready
to give it all she's got.

393
00:15:28,467 --> 00:15:29,533
Here we go, here we go,

394
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:30,467
the initial spin!

395
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,133
[all shouting] Oh!

396
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:34,667
All she's got
is just too much.

397
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,967
That was very hard to watch.

398
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,400
I tried.

399
00:15:37,533 --> 00:15:38,433
Next up is the reigning champ,

400
00:15:38,567 --> 00:15:41,300
MVP,
and future Hall-of-Famer--

401
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:45,367
[all together]
Zoey... Levin!

402
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,467
Whoo!

403
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,333
[everyone cheering]

404
00:15:48,467 --> 00:15:50,667
Levin has the best wrist
in the league,

405
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,367
and she's about
to show it off now

406
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,967
with her signature 360 spiral!

407
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,266
You got this, you got this.

408
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,467
I don't see spins like that
very often, Bob.

409
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,500
I believe she's using
the Manischewitz Maneuver.

410
00:16:02,633 --> 00:16:03,600
Spinning, spinning.

411
00:16:03,734 --> 00:16:05,266
The crowd waiting
in anticipation!

412
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,033
[all cheering]

413
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:12,333
Witnessing yet another show
of history-in-the-making.

414
00:16:12,467 --> 00:16:13,867
That is a giant jackpot.

415
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,033
-Look at that golden gal.
-She's doing a great dance.

416
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,100
Get it, get it!

417
00:16:18,233 --> 00:16:20,400
Oh, the crowd
loves to see that.

418
00:16:20,533 --> 00:16:21,567
The future Rabbi--

419
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,767
Or astronaut!

420
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,367
--or astronaut

421
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,533
generously sharing
her coveted prize

422
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:28,266
with her Aunt Sarah,

423
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,734
who could never get
enough chocolate.

424
00:16:29,867 --> 00:16:30,900
The same shtick every year.

425
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:32,734
You guys need new material.

426
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:34,066
-Hey, hey, hey!
-Hey!

427
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,166
Leave me and Uncle Daniel alone.

428
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,033
Zoey loves our shtick.

429
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,066
Don't you, Zoey?

430
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,400
Sure, Dad.

431
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:42,600
[laughter]

432
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,900
You know,

433
00:16:46,033 --> 00:16:47,000
you should have one of your own.

434
00:16:48,834 --> 00:16:50,200
Yeah, I'm thinking about it.

435
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,433
I said I'm thinking.

436
00:16:53,567 --> 00:16:54,800
-Okay.
-What's with the look?

437
00:16:54,934 --> 00:16:56,433
-I don't know.
-You have a look.

438
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:59,300
-What look?
-I see a look.

439
00:17:05,467 --> 00:17:08,433
Hey, everyone,
it was so nice to meet you all.

440
00:17:08,567 --> 00:17:09,567
Thank you for having me.

441
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,834
My first Hanukkah
did not disappoint.

442
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,767
Well, I hope
it's not your last.

443
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,000
Absolutely not.

444
00:17:16,133 --> 00:17:17,433
Same time next year.

445
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,000
-Bye, baby.
-Bye.

446
00:17:19,133 --> 00:17:21,800
Thanks again. Bye.

447
00:17:21,934 --> 00:17:24,600
Dad, you're not going
to sleep tonight.

448
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:31,100
Sarah?

449
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,000
Sarah!

450
00:17:33,967 --> 00:17:35,300
Sarah!

451
00:17:35,433 --> 00:17:36,200
What?

452
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,800
Somebody left you a present.

453
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:40,300
What?

454
00:17:40,433 --> 00:17:42,734
Who's it from?

455
00:17:42,867 --> 00:17:44,300
What's it say?

456
00:17:44,433 --> 00:17:45,600
"For Sarah,

457
00:17:45,734 --> 00:17:46,633
Night One,

458
00:17:46,767 --> 00:17:49,567
Roses almost as lovely as you."

459
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,834
That's it?

460
00:17:51,967 --> 00:17:53,767
Yeah.

461
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,266
Looks like you have
a secret admirer.

462
00:17:59,066 --> 00:18:01,233
I guess I do.

463
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,133
[♪]

464
00:18:06,266 --> 00:18:09,333
Whoever he is,
he has great taste.

465
00:18:09,467 --> 00:18:10,800
And a man of few words.

466
00:18:12,867 --> 00:18:14,900
[Esther]
I'm struck by the anonymity.

467
00:18:15,033 --> 00:18:15,967
What's that?

468
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,567
-He didn't sign his name.
-Oh.

469
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,300
Well, maybe he isn't sure
how Sarah feels about him yet.

470
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,200
I can think of a few suspects.

471
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:23,233
There's no crime here,
Your Honor.

472
00:18:23,367 --> 00:18:24,200
[chuckling]

473
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:25,834
Ooh, what about
that chef you met?

474
00:18:25,967 --> 00:18:27,533
Or what about Adam?

475
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:29,333
I think it might be
closer to home.

476
00:18:29,467 --> 00:18:30,633
What about Tom?

477
00:18:30,767 --> 00:18:31,467
Ooh, or Paul!

478
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,633
Maybe he wants you back.

479
00:18:33,767 --> 00:18:35,367
What about that cardiologist
you dated in med school?

480
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,200
No, he's married with two kids.

481
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,233
I do his taxes.

482
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,133
Okay, everyone needs
to just shh!

483
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,133
Roses mean a lot to me.

484
00:18:43,266 --> 00:18:45,100
Okay?

485
00:18:45,233 --> 00:18:46,333
Remember Bubbe Rose's garden?

486
00:18:46,467 --> 00:18:49,700
It was her pride and joy.

487
00:18:49,834 --> 00:18:50,700
I used to think

488
00:18:50,834 --> 00:18:51,700
that's why we called her
Bubbe Rose.

489
00:18:51,834 --> 00:18:54,200
[laughter]

490
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,567
And the white ones
were her favorite.

491
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,033
Well, whoever sent
those flowers

492
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,000
hit a home-run.

493
00:18:58,133 --> 00:18:59,433
And I guess

494
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:01,200
there are seven
more innings to go.

495
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,367
But aren't there
nine innings in baseball?

496
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,567
Ah, yes,
but Hanukkah has eight.

497
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,800
Innings.

498
00:19:07,934 --> 00:19:09,400
-Got it.
-[laughter]

499
00:19:10,767 --> 00:19:11,567
Yeah.

500
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,500
Well...

501
00:19:14,934 --> 00:19:16,533
game on.

502
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,367
So you know
I've been up all night

503
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,900
trying to figure out
who this guy is.

504
00:19:31,033 --> 00:19:33,033
All right, we need
to narrow down the list.

505
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,033
Okay.

506
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,533
Well, I'm seeing Adam
for coffee.

507
00:19:36,667 --> 00:19:38,166
I'm seeing Tom
at the hotel later.

508
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,033
That might help, I don't know.

509
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,867
What about Daniel?

510
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,266
No, it's not Daniel.

511
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,834
We know each other too well,
we go back too far.

512
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:48,133
I mean, there was this, like,
minute-and-a-half

513
00:19:48,266 --> 00:19:50,700
in high school, but...

514
00:19:50,834 --> 00:19:52,133
What happened?

515
00:19:52,266 --> 00:19:53,166
Nothing.

516
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,300
Absolutely nothing,

517
00:19:54,433 --> 00:19:55,533
which is exactly the point.

518
00:19:55,667 --> 00:19:59,133
I mean, I just got it
into my teenage head

519
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:00,800
that maybe he would
ask me to the prom,

520
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:01,700
but he didn't.

521
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:04,033
He asked out what's-her-face...

522
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:05,633
Sandy Lembeck.

523
00:20:05,767 --> 00:20:08,033
What about Sandy Lembeck?

524
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:11,100
What?

525
00:20:11,233 --> 00:20:12,266
What are you talking about?

526
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,967
I thought I heard you
say her name.

527
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,100
[laughing]
Why would I say her name?

528
00:20:18,233 --> 00:20:19,033
[laughing nervously]

529
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:20,667
How did you even get in here?

530
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,033
You gave me a key, remember?

531
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,300
Of course, I remember.

532
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:26,333
[scoffs]

533
00:20:26,467 --> 00:20:27,567
I gave him a key?

534
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,867
-Apparently.
-I gave him a key...

535
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,100
You were saying?

536
00:20:31,233 --> 00:20:32,367
I'm just saying,

537
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,033
the flowers are not
from Daniel.

538
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:36,867
We are just friends.

539
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,467
It's just as well.

540
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,600
What does that mean?

541
00:20:39,734 --> 00:20:42,633
It means his relationships
never last.

542
00:20:42,767 --> 00:20:44,166
No one's ever
good enough for him,

543
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,200
and besides,

544
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,834
he doesn't see me that way.

545
00:20:46,967 --> 00:20:48,867
Good friends are hard to find,

546
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,934
so there's that.

547
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,533
Your mom called,

548
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:57,967
Tom said he would meet you
in the ballroom at the hotel,

549
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,266
and Adam is on his way.

550
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,367
Okay, great, thank you.

551
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,567
I was curious,
so I googled him.

552
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,667
Turns out

553
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,400
he's this genius
software developer.

554
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:08,266
Wow.

555
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,934
That would explain why
he's always so distracted, huh?

556
00:21:11,066 --> 00:21:13,834
And he just sold his company.

557
00:21:13,967 --> 00:21:16,333
We're talking tech-money,
which tends to be huge.

558
00:21:16,467 --> 00:21:18,367
Expensive gifts
like two dozen roses

559
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,233
would make sense.

560
00:21:19,367 --> 00:21:20,667
Hmm.

561
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,834
He's also very shy,

562
00:21:22,967 --> 00:21:25,700
which would explain
why he wouldn't sign the card.

563
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,700
Hey, I'm grabbing some lunch.

564
00:21:28,834 --> 00:21:29,734
You guys want anything?

565
00:21:29,867 --> 00:21:31,867
Corned beef on rye,
extra mustard?

566
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,166
[laughs] Thanks,

567
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,900
but, actually, I have a date.

568
00:21:35,033 --> 00:21:36,367
-You have a date?
-Yeah.

569
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,934
With who?

570
00:21:38,066 --> 00:21:39,934
Uh... him.

571
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,066
You're here.

572
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,166
Yeah, I work here. [laughs]

573
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,100
Kind of a safe bet.

574
00:21:48,233 --> 00:21:50,600
At the risk of blowing
any chance I have

575
00:21:50,734 --> 00:21:53,100
of being mistaken for cool,

576
00:21:53,233 --> 00:21:55,266
I've never been more excited
for a cup of coffee.

577
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,433
[laughs]
Okay, well, um...

578
00:21:59,567 --> 00:22:00,767
Okay. [laughs]

579
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,834
Let's, uh...

580
00:22:01,967 --> 00:22:03,834
Let's get some coffee.

581
00:22:03,967 --> 00:22:04,934
Get some coffee...

582
00:22:05,066 --> 00:22:06,000
Okay.

583
00:22:06,133 --> 00:22:07,233
Bye.

584
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,333
Make good choices.

585
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,400
That's the guy who keeps
losing his glasses?

586
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:14,133
He's got a lot on his mind.

587
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:15,266
Like what?

588
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,133
Complicated tech-stuff...

589
00:22:18,266 --> 00:22:21,500
and apparently, Sarah.

590
00:22:22,867 --> 00:22:24,133
So if coffee goes well,

591
00:22:24,266 --> 00:22:26,600
maybe we could
work our way up to lunch,

592
00:22:26,734 --> 00:22:29,000
or maybe even dinner?

593
00:22:29,133 --> 00:22:30,633
Yeah.

594
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,133
Yeah, I can see that happening.

595
00:22:32,266 --> 00:22:34,633
Uh, there's this great place
in San Francisco

596
00:22:34,767 --> 00:22:35,734
that I'd love to take you to.

597
00:22:35,867 --> 00:22:36,800
[laughs]

598
00:22:36,934 --> 00:22:38,300
San Francisco?

599
00:22:38,433 --> 00:22:40,967
Wow, that's a long way to go
for a meal.

600
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,500
Well, when I sold
my start-up company,

601
00:22:42,633 --> 00:22:43,667
part of the deal

602
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,066
was that I got to use
the corporate jet.

603
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:48,266
[sighs]

604
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,867
I'm trying to impress you,
and...

605
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,433
Is it working?

606
00:22:55,567 --> 00:22:56,433
[laughs]

607
00:22:56,567 --> 00:22:58,433
Uh, well,
asking that question is.

608
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,667
Honesty goes
a long way with me, so...

609
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,834
Here's some more.

610
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:06,867
I... I spent my life
talking to a computers,

611
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,700
so my social skills
are a little lacking,

612
00:23:09,834 --> 00:23:12,734
hence all the spare glasses.

613
00:23:12,867 --> 00:23:14,700
Well,

614
00:23:14,834 --> 00:23:17,333
they got you a dinner
in San Francisco.

615
00:23:17,467 --> 00:23:19,333
Really?

616
00:23:19,467 --> 00:23:20,400
When?

617
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:24,166
Let's just keep it local
till after the holidays.

618
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,066
Right, right, okay.

619
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:28,467
You know,

620
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,233
in honor of Hanukkah,

621
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,233
I've been leaning into
my Jewish side a little more.

622
00:23:32,367 --> 00:23:35,066
It is my favorite time of year,
you know.

623
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,700
And now it's mine.

624
00:23:37,767 --> 00:23:38,633
Too much?

625
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:40,633
[laughs]

626
00:23:40,767 --> 00:23:42,934
You're doing fine.

627
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,033
[♪]

628
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:49,066
I can't believe
how long it's been

629
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,066
since I've been here.

630
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,233
Yeah, I know.

631
00:23:52,367 --> 00:23:53,834
Wow.

632
00:23:53,967 --> 00:23:55,233
Is it finished?

633
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,667
I can't see this
getting any better than this.

634
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,367
It's pretty close.

635
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,934
You've come a long way

636
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:02,934
since building those forts
in my backyard.

637
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,033
I mean, you know,

638
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:05,934
cardboard boxes
are an underrated medium.

639
00:24:06,066 --> 00:24:07,133
[laughs]

640
00:24:07,266 --> 00:24:09,400
Except when they wilt
in the rain.

641
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:11,100
Well, they were fun
while they lasted.

642
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:12,433
Yeah. Come on.

643
00:24:12,567 --> 00:24:16,300
[♪]

644
00:24:20,533 --> 00:24:22,734
I think the Hanukkah Hunt
will be great here.

645
00:24:22,867 --> 00:24:23,867
Wow.

646
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,834
For sure.

647
00:24:24,967 --> 00:24:26,600
There's, like,
a million places outside

648
00:24:26,734 --> 00:24:27,734
that we can hide the Gelt.

649
00:24:27,867 --> 00:24:28,967
Yeah.

650
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,633
I mean, I can't wait
for all the kids to be here,

651
00:24:30,767 --> 00:24:34,200
you know, running around,
jacked up on sugar.

652
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:36,200
I don't think
you should sell this place.

653
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:37,934
I think you should keep it.

654
00:24:38,066 --> 00:24:39,266
You know, that way, one day,

655
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,900
you can have
your own little kids

656
00:24:41,033 --> 00:24:42,734
running around
all hyped up on sugar.

657
00:24:42,867 --> 00:24:43,667
Yeah.

658
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,000
Yeah, I think I'd like that.

659
00:24:45,133 --> 00:24:46,066
Mm-hmm.

660
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,433
And I'm glad you like it.

661
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:50,066
The house.

662
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,567
I'm glad you like the house.

663
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,567
Yeah.

664
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,800
It's so you, I love it.

665
00:24:55,967 --> 00:24:57,467
Thanks.

666
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,333
So your list
of anonymous suitors,

667
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:03,533
who's on it?

668
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:05,266
It's a work in progress.

669
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,700
What about your list?

670
00:25:06,834 --> 00:25:07,700
Can we talk about your list?

671
00:25:07,834 --> 00:25:08,667
My list?
I don't have a list.

672
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,667
Oh, please.

673
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,500
No one's leaving roses
on my porch.

674
00:25:11,633 --> 00:25:12,467
Trust me.

675
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,533
Okay, it's not the roses.

676
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:16,433
It's the fact
that someone out there

677
00:25:16,567 --> 00:25:17,700
actually cares.

678
00:25:17,834 --> 00:25:19,967
Well, whoever he is,
he'd be lucky to have you.

679
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,033
True story.

680
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:22,033
Amen, sister.

681
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:23,100
You want a cup of tea? Yeah?

682
00:25:23,233 --> 00:25:25,133
Yeah, I'd love some tea.

683
00:25:26,633 --> 00:25:29,100
Okay, so good, yeah.

684
00:25:29,233 --> 00:25:32,834
I think it will work
even better than the park.

685
00:25:32,967 --> 00:25:33,834
I think so, too.

686
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:35,166
Yeah.

687
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,834
Do you have time
for a game?

688
00:25:36,967 --> 00:25:39,433
Oh, ho, ho!

689
00:25:39,567 --> 00:25:41,200
Bring it.

690
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:43,500
Well, last time I brought it,
you lost.

691
00:25:43,633 --> 00:25:47,633
Uh, pretty sure I fell asleep
waiting for you to make a move.

692
00:25:47,767 --> 00:25:50,133
And that move was check-mate.

693
00:25:50,266 --> 00:25:51,133
[sighs]

694
00:25:51,266 --> 00:25:53,033
You're going down.

695
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,700
This is just like Chess Club
in high school,

696
00:25:59,834 --> 00:26:01,133
only you've gotten slower.

697
00:26:01,266 --> 00:26:03,767
Mm-mm, you've confused
speed with ability.

698
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,000
Oh, you want to talk
about ability?

699
00:26:06,133 --> 00:26:07,567
Do you know

700
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,900
that out of the 236 games
that we've played,

701
00:26:11,033 --> 00:26:12,400
I won 141?

702
00:26:12,533 --> 00:26:14,433
I cannot believe
you're keeping a tally.

703
00:26:14,567 --> 00:26:17,000
I cannot believe
you are not making a move.

704
00:26:17,133 --> 00:26:18,100
You're so cautious.

705
00:26:18,233 --> 00:26:20,333
It's very complicated
from my perspective.

706
00:26:20,467 --> 00:26:22,467
Is that so?

707
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,533
Excuse me.

708
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,400
Rook to Bishop 4.

709
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:31,033
So I should just
ignore your knight?

710
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:32,900
Wait, is this a new queen?

711
00:26:33,033 --> 00:26:35,400
Yeah.

712
00:26:35,533 --> 00:26:38,166
When in doubt, I whittle.

713
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,867
What are you in doubt about?

714
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,066
My next move.

715
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,233
Well, sometimes, Daniel,

716
00:26:46,367 --> 00:26:49,467
you just have to make one.

717
00:26:53,934 --> 00:26:56,033
See, that was very bold of you.

718
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:57,400
You wanted me to make a move.

719
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:58,667
[laughs]

720
00:27:02,567 --> 00:27:03,500
Right, I gotta...

721
00:27:03,633 --> 00:27:05,600
I gotta get going.

722
00:27:06,734 --> 00:27:07,834
Too bad.

723
00:27:07,967 --> 00:27:09,633
I don't want the game to end.

724
00:27:09,767 --> 00:27:10,900
Yeah, I, uh...

725
00:27:11,033 --> 00:27:15,433
I promised my mom
I'd help her with dinner, so...

726
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:16,433
don't be late.

727
00:27:16,567 --> 00:27:18,367
To be continued.

728
00:27:29,133 --> 00:27:31,000
Is that enough chicken?

729
00:27:31,133 --> 00:27:33,533
It should last me
until tomorrow night.

730
00:27:33,667 --> 00:27:34,800
[chuckles]

731
00:27:34,934 --> 00:27:36,734
To me, you're still
a growing boy.

732
00:27:36,867 --> 00:27:38,033
Yeah, but I'm growing wider,
not taller.

733
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:39,533
[laughs]

734
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:42,000
And I packed extra latkes.

735
00:27:42,133 --> 00:27:43,433
You can have those
for breakfast.

736
00:27:43,567 --> 00:27:45,500
Ooh, Your Honor, I will oblige.

737
00:27:45,633 --> 00:27:46,667
Mm-hmm.

738
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,667
You taking off, bro?

739
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,300
Yeah, bro.

740
00:27:49,433 --> 00:27:51,867
You haven't called me bro
since high school.

741
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,467
Ah, it's getting the band
back together.

742
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,000
I'm reliving my youth.

743
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:57,633
[imitating drums]

744
00:27:57,767 --> 00:27:59,000
My god, now there's
a scary thought right there.

745
00:27:59,133 --> 00:28:00,533
[trilling playfully]

746
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:02,734
Okay, I gotta go.

747
00:28:02,867 --> 00:28:04,567
I gotta go, thank you so much.
It was so good.

748
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,400
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

749
00:28:05,533 --> 00:28:06,834
I will see you tomorrow

750
00:28:06,967 --> 00:28:09,600
at your
soon-to-be-renovated office.

751
00:28:09,734 --> 00:28:11,467
Yes, you will. Bro.

752
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,734
Yeah!

753
00:28:12,867 --> 00:28:13,734
[laughs]

754
00:28:13,867 --> 00:28:14,700
-Bro!
-Bro!

755
00:28:14,834 --> 00:28:16,667
Bye.

756
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,367
[sighing]

757
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,700
You guys are special.

758
00:28:19,834 --> 00:28:20,867
Mm-hmm.

759
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,033
Mm!

760
00:28:24,367 --> 00:28:25,533
Oh, these are for Zoey.

761
00:28:25,667 --> 00:28:27,834
-Oh... right.
-Yeah.

762
00:28:27,967 --> 00:28:29,266
-For Zoey.
-[chuckling]

763
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,600
I should probably get her home.

764
00:28:30,734 --> 00:28:31,934
She's half asleep already.

765
00:28:32,066 --> 00:28:34,166
Too much fun,
and too much Gelt,

766
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,567
and too many presents.

767
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,600
-Oh, come on.
-Never!

768
00:28:37,734 --> 00:28:39,567
You know,
I can't resist myself.

769
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,567
Nougie, nougie, nougie!

770
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,667
Okay!

771
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,734
[laughs]

772
00:28:42,867 --> 00:28:43,734
You know it takes
a lot of work

773
00:28:43,867 --> 00:28:44,667
to look like this.

774
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,266
Yeah, no, I know,
a lot of work.

775
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,667
-Bye.
-Bye, sweetie.

776
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,633
Great dinner.

777
00:28:49,767 --> 00:28:51,066
Shall we?

778
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,433
Yes, we shall.

779
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:55,900
I'll walk you and Zoey out.

780
00:28:56,033 --> 00:28:56,934
[sighs fondly]

781
00:28:57,066 --> 00:28:59,100
What a father Jacob's become.

782
00:28:59,233 --> 00:29:00,400
I know.

783
00:29:00,533 --> 00:29:02,433
When he lost Ava,
I wasn't sure he'd be okay.

784
00:29:02,567 --> 00:29:03,800
Oh, he's fine.

785
00:29:03,934 --> 00:29:06,100
He's got Zoey, and his band.

786
00:29:06,233 --> 00:29:09,633
He's like the Ringo Starr
of CPAs.

787
00:29:09,767 --> 00:29:10,734
[laughs]

788
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,934
So any idea
who your secret admirer is?

789
00:29:15,066 --> 00:29:16,333
Mm-mm, no,

790
00:29:16,467 --> 00:29:20,000
but I'm having a great time
trying to figure it out.

791
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,066
You always loved
puzzles and mysteries.

792
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,433
This is right up your alley.

793
00:29:23,567 --> 00:29:26,900
Mm, I'm like
the Jewish Nancy Drew.

794
00:29:27,033 --> 00:29:27,934
[chuckles]

795
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:28,867
[gasps]

796
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,400
Maybe he'll give us
another clue.

797
00:29:31,934 --> 00:29:33,900
Maybe I'll get us
another slice of kugel.

798
00:29:34,033 --> 00:29:35,600
[laughs]

799
00:29:35,734 --> 00:29:36,667
That's an idea.

800
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,233
[♪]

801
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,266
Whoa.

802
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,000
That's a lot of chocolate.

803
00:30:06,133 --> 00:30:09,767
[telephone rings]

804
00:30:16,433 --> 00:30:18,233
Did you get another gift?

805
00:30:18,367 --> 00:30:19,300
What did the card say?

806
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,867
"Night Two.

807
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,900
Sarah, sweeter than chocolate."

808
00:30:25,033 --> 00:30:26,500
That's not a lot to go on.

809
00:30:26,633 --> 00:30:27,700
I know.

810
00:30:27,834 --> 00:30:29,834
It's someone that knows
how much I love chocolate

811
00:30:29,967 --> 00:30:30,834
and roses.

812
00:30:30,967 --> 00:30:32,000
Well, whoever it is,

813
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:33,734
he hit another home run.

814
00:30:33,867 --> 00:30:35,667
Yeah, well, there's
enough chocolate in here

815
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,900
to last me till next Hanukkah.

816
00:30:38,033 --> 00:30:39,800
I feel like I'm always

817
00:30:39,934 --> 00:30:40,900
trying to make things last

818
00:30:41,033 --> 00:30:43,433
probably longer
than they should.

819
00:30:43,567 --> 00:30:46,066
Still trying to find
a love that lasts.

820
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,934
Oh, sweetheart.

821
00:30:48,066 --> 00:30:51,233
If it's the real thing,
it doesn't end.

822
00:30:51,367 --> 00:30:52,734
It only grows.

823
00:30:52,867 --> 00:30:54,233
[chuckles fondly]

824
00:30:54,367 --> 00:30:55,633
Love you, Mom.

825
00:30:55,767 --> 00:30:56,734
Good night.

826
00:30:56,867 --> 00:30:58,033
Love you.

827
00:31:05,467 --> 00:31:07,500
[Sarah] So, I get home,
and there it was,

828
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:09,133
this beautiful basket,

829
00:31:09,266 --> 00:31:12,900
with the most amazing chocolate
I've ever had in my life.

830
00:31:13,033 --> 00:31:14,734
And still no idea
who this guy is?

831
00:31:14,867 --> 00:31:16,533
[imitating Forest Gump]
Life is like

832
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:18,500
a basket of chocolates.

833
00:31:18,633 --> 00:31:20,133
You never know--

834
00:31:20,266 --> 00:31:21,166
[together]
--what you're gonna get.

835
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,233
Or who they're from.

836
00:31:23,367 --> 00:31:24,066
[laughing]

837
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,133
-What?
-Sorry.

838
00:31:26,266 --> 00:31:28,900
"Forrest Gump" was, like,
my favorite movie as a kid.

839
00:31:29,033 --> 00:31:30,567
She would sit in the dark,

840
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,867
chocolate all over her face,

841
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,166
crying her eyes out.

842
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,667
Not because of the story,

843
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,967
because she'd run out
of Raisinets.

844
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,133
Excuse me,

845
00:31:37,266 --> 00:31:38,834
you love that movie
just as much as I do.

846
00:31:38,967 --> 00:31:40,000
Yes, I do.

847
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,567
All right, I have to
get back to work.

848
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,834
Uh, Mr. Wilson should be
in Exam Room 2.

849
00:31:45,967 --> 00:31:47,233
His eyes should be
dilated by now.

850
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:50,567
Also, did you get this email
from SwapOrBid

851
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,967
about those antique glasses?

852
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
[Sarah] Let me see that.

853
00:31:56,133 --> 00:31:57,900
Oh, I hope
they haven't sold yet.

854
00:31:58,033 --> 00:32:00,767
[cell phone rings]

855
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,033
Um, will you see
what you can find?

856
00:32:03,166 --> 00:32:04,033
Yeah, sure.

857
00:32:04,166 --> 00:32:05,000
I'm on it.

858
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:06,200
Hey, Nigel.

859
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:09,567
Lovely hearing from you.

860
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,066
That guy's very persistent.

861
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,300
Maybe he's the one
sending the gifts.

862
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:16,100
Well, I would love
to have lunch

863
00:32:16,233 --> 00:32:17,367
at your restaurant,

864
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,633
but, um, I kind of have
a busy week.

865
00:32:20,767 --> 00:32:24,967
Okay, well, how about
I bring the restaurant to you?

866
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,233
[chuckles]

867
00:32:26,367 --> 00:32:27,400
What does that mean?

868
00:32:27,533 --> 00:32:28,600
Well, think of it

869
00:32:28,734 --> 00:32:29,767
like a picnic of sorts,

870
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,834
but one prepared
by a Michelin-starred chef.

871
00:32:32,967 --> 00:32:36,200
Well, how can I resist
an offer like that?

872
00:32:37,066 --> 00:32:39,967
[chuckles]
Well, you can't.

873
00:32:44,066 --> 00:32:44,867
What was the offer?

874
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,233
Oh, nothing.

875
00:32:46,367 --> 00:32:47,667
Just a gourmet meal

876
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,467
prepared by one
of Seattle's top chefs.

877
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,033
No big deal.

878
00:33:01,467 --> 00:33:03,867
[♪]

879
00:33:12,433 --> 00:33:13,967
Hey.

880
00:33:15,233 --> 00:33:16,567
Welcome!

881
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,800
I'm Keisha,

882
00:33:17,934 --> 00:33:18,767
Sarah's assistant,

883
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,700
and friend.

884
00:33:19,834 --> 00:33:21,066
Good to know.

885
00:33:23,066 --> 00:33:23,967
Is she here?

886
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,200
[chuckles]

887
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:27,200
Right. Sarah.
She'll be out in a second.

888
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:29,667
Hi.

889
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,333
-Hey.
-Hey.

890
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:32,834
I hope you're hungry.

891
00:33:32,967 --> 00:33:36,500
Wow, what a lovely basket.

892
00:33:36,633 --> 00:33:40,400
Do you always deliver lunch
in baskets?

893
00:33:40,533 --> 00:33:43,600
It's a picnic basket,

894
00:33:43,734 --> 00:33:45,467
but I do save it
for special occasions,

895
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,600
like this one.

896
00:33:48,767 --> 00:33:51,367
Oh, um, Nigel,
this is my friend, Daniel.

897
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,433
Hey.

898
00:33:52,567 --> 00:33:53,467
Nice to meet you.

899
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,967
Yeah, you too.

900
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,767
We can have lunch
in my office.

901
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,500
Lead the way.

902
00:33:58,633 --> 00:34:00,100
Okay.

903
00:34:00,233 --> 00:34:01,100
Nice to meet you.

904
00:34:01,233 --> 00:34:02,200
See ya.

905
00:34:05,767 --> 00:34:07,934
I really hope
Nigel is the guy.

906
00:34:08,066 --> 00:34:09,367
Really?

907
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,100
Yeah, I mean, he's nice,

908
00:34:11,233 --> 00:34:12,667
and he's famous,

909
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,033
and he's really cute.

910
00:34:30,066 --> 00:34:32,333
They've been in there
a long time.

911
00:34:32,467 --> 00:34:33,467
Must be going well.

912
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,433
She met him on a dating app,
he could be anyone.

913
00:34:35,567 --> 00:34:37,233
I'm sure he is
who he says he is.

914
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:38,367
I mean, he has his own TV show.

915
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,166
Right.

916
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,300
But it's sweet
how protective you are.

917
00:34:43,533 --> 00:34:47,767
Well, that was
the best office picnic

918
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,266
I've ever had.

919
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,734
Also the only one...

920
00:34:50,867 --> 00:34:52,100
-[chuckles]
-but still.

921
00:34:52,233 --> 00:34:54,433
Well, perhaps
we can do it again.

922
00:34:54,567 --> 00:34:57,300
I would really like that.

923
00:34:57,433 --> 00:34:58,867
Well, in that case,

924
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,600
I hope it's very soon.

925
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,834
Me too.

926
00:35:03,967 --> 00:35:05,533
I can't wait.

927
00:35:11,633 --> 00:35:14,633
Not many guys can pull off
kissing a woman's hand.

928
00:35:14,767 --> 00:35:16,633
Personally,
I thought it was a little much.

929
00:35:16,767 --> 00:35:19,166
Well, I thought it was swell.

930
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,000
Swell?

931
00:35:20,133 --> 00:35:21,500
Yeah.

932
00:35:21,633 --> 00:35:23,100
Well, it was.

933
00:35:24,133 --> 00:35:25,633
She did just say "swell"?

934
00:35:25,767 --> 00:35:27,400
She did.

935
00:35:27,533 --> 00:35:28,500
Swell...

936
00:35:38,734 --> 00:35:39,867
[sighs]

937
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,066
Hey, I couldn't find
those knobs that you wanted,

938
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,867
but I got something close.

939
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Okay.

940
00:35:46,133 --> 00:35:49,033
I can finish up those shelves.

941
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:50,700
Okay.

942
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:55,934
But only if you pay me
1,000 bucks an hour.

943
00:35:57,967 --> 00:35:59,667
You're good,
but you're not that good.

944
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,934
[chuckles]

945
00:36:01,066 --> 00:36:02,934
What is going on with you?

946
00:36:05,734 --> 00:36:07,133
I got an offer
from a developer

947
00:36:07,266 --> 00:36:09,900
to build seven custom homes
in Aspen.

948
00:36:10,033 --> 00:36:13,300
And that's a bad thing
because...?

949
00:36:13,433 --> 00:36:14,300
It means moving there,

950
00:36:14,433 --> 00:36:16,333
probably for a few years.

951
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,834
And that's a bad thing
because...?

952
00:36:18,967 --> 00:36:20,467
My life!

953
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,066
My friends,

954
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,900
the closest thing I have
to a family is here.

955
00:36:27,433 --> 00:36:28,433
Okay,

956
00:36:28,567 --> 00:36:29,600
so what are you gonna do?

957
00:36:29,734 --> 00:36:31,333
I don't know.

958
00:36:32,867 --> 00:36:34,000
I haven't decided.

959
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:36,633
Hey, am I invited
if you take this gig?

960
00:36:36,767 --> 00:36:38,066
Not for 1,000 bucks an hour.

961
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,500
I'll give you a discount.

962
00:36:39,633 --> 00:36:41,333
You'd give me a discount?

963
00:36:41,467 --> 00:36:43,100
Oh, I appreciate that.

964
00:36:43,233 --> 00:36:45,166
That's so nice of you, man.
Thank you.

965
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,767
Only for you.

966
00:36:53,033 --> 00:36:55,967
So, in addition
to the Mazel Ball,

967
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,166
we're also overseeing
the Hanukkah Hunt this year.

968
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,066
For those of you
who don't know,

969
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,867
that's like an Easter Egg hunt,
but with Gelt...

970
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,400
And that is why
we need more toys.

971
00:37:04,533 --> 00:37:07,000
We really want all the kids
to feel like they won.

972
00:37:07,133 --> 00:37:08,834
We have a problem.

973
00:37:08,967 --> 00:37:10,000
We're in the middle
of a meeting, Myra.

974
00:37:10,133 --> 00:37:12,166
The caterer for the Mazel Ball
was double-booked.

975
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,867
That's why he wasn't
returning my calls,

976
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,200
and when I confronted him,

977
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:16,367
he quit.

978
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,533
The hotel restaurant
doesn't do private events.

979
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:21,200
We will never get
a decent caterer

980
00:37:21,333 --> 00:37:23,000
on such short notice.

981
00:37:23,133 --> 00:37:28,400
Okay, I may know someone
who might be able to help.

982
00:37:28,533 --> 00:37:30,200
Nigel Templeton
is a friend of mine.

983
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:32,700
This is your solution?

984
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:35,233
He's a very
well-known chef, Myra.

985
00:37:35,367 --> 00:37:36,633
Yeah, I know who he is--

986
00:37:36,767 --> 00:37:38,166
Mr. Continental Fusion.

987
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,333
What does he know

988
00:37:39,467 --> 00:37:41,266
about the traditions
of Hanukkah?

989
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:47,600
Do we really want our dinner
to be all chefy and fancy?

990
00:37:47,734 --> 00:37:48,633
Fancy.

991
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:51,834
So the Mazel Ball
will have a fusion twist.

992
00:37:51,967 --> 00:37:54,000
-[sighs]
-Mushy peas and Scottish eggs?

993
00:37:54,133 --> 00:37:56,333
That is, if he's even
willing to do it.

994
00:37:56,467 --> 00:37:58,166
I mean, honestly,
I cannot imagine him

995
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,533
catering a Hanukkah fundraiser.

996
00:37:59,667 --> 00:38:01,867
Yeah, he's so busy,
he's not available probably.

997
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,033
Mm-mm.

998
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:05,066
Let's just see about that.

999
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,166
Yeah.

1000
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,734
All right, moving on.

1001
00:38:12,066 --> 00:38:13,200
[message alert buzzes]

1002
00:38:15,367 --> 00:38:16,600
Sarah?

1003
00:38:16,734 --> 00:38:17,867
Yeah?

1004
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,200
Can I talk to you a minute?

1005
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:22,300
Uh, sorry,
this might be Nigel.

1006
00:38:23,266 --> 00:38:24,867
Is it him?

1007
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,133
No, it's...

1008
00:38:26,266 --> 00:38:30,233
I've been trying to get
these vintage glasses online.

1009
00:38:30,367 --> 00:38:32,700
They look just like the ones
Bubbe Rose used to have.

1010
00:38:32,834 --> 00:38:34,066
Yeah.

1011
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,066
Sorry.

1012
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,066
What's up?

1013
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,066
Well, a lot's happened
over the last few months.

1014
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,066
I made partner.

1015
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,800
Wow.

1016
00:38:41,934 --> 00:38:42,867
That's fantastic.

1017
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,700
Congratulations.

1018
00:38:44,834 --> 00:38:47,000
I know how much
that meant to you.

1019
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,033
You mean a lot to me, too.

1020
00:38:51,166 --> 00:38:54,467
I've been thinking a lot
about our life together.

1021
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,967
I miss you, Sarah.

1022
00:38:59,166 --> 00:39:00,800
Um...

1023
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,133
I'm not really sure
what to say.

1024
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,433
[Sarah humming]

1025
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,133
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

1026
00:39:14,266 --> 00:39:15,367
How many of these
did we put in it?

1027
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,333
Three.

1028
00:39:16,467 --> 00:39:18,266
No, four!

1029
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,100
[laughs]

1030
00:39:19,233 --> 00:39:19,967
I lost count.

1031
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:20,867
Is that bad?

1032
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,166
[laughing]

1033
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,133
It's not like
it's our first time

1034
00:39:23,266 --> 00:39:24,166
making latkes.

1035
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,200
I know, but this is
the first time

1036
00:39:25,333 --> 00:39:26,266
I've ever hosted
a Hanukkah dinner.

1037
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,300
Aw...

1038
00:39:27,433 --> 00:39:28,867
are you nervous?

1039
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,066
No!

1040
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,867
Yes, I'm freaking out.

1041
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,166
[laughs]

1042
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:38,367
I want to make sure
I follow Bubbe Rose's recipe

1043
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,533
to the letter,

1044
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:40,433
or should I say, to the latke.

1045
00:39:40,567 --> 00:39:41,900
That's her recipe right there?

1046
00:39:42,033 --> 00:39:43,000
Yeah, she gave it to me.

1047
00:39:43,133 --> 00:39:44,133
Jealous?

1048
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:46,367
Here.

1049
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,166
She knew how much
I loved them...

1050
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,633
and her.

1051
00:39:49,767 --> 00:39:50,500
Aw...

1052
00:39:50,633 --> 00:39:52,600
Ooh, brisket!

1053
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,467
How's it looking in there?

1054
00:39:56,567 --> 00:39:57,467
Looks like Hanukkah.

1055
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,367
[chuckles]

1056
00:40:01,133 --> 00:40:04,800
So, um, have you spoken
to your dad recently?

1057
00:40:06,166 --> 00:40:07,033
Uh, yeah,

1058
00:40:07,166 --> 00:40:10,200
he called to wish me
a Happy Hanukkah.

1059
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:11,433
How did that go?

1060
00:40:11,567 --> 00:40:13,300
It was polite,

1061
00:40:13,433 --> 00:40:14,533
distant.

1062
00:40:14,667 --> 00:40:18,467
He and his wife seem to like
living in Florida.

1063
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,934
You know your dad
was more of a father to me.

1064
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,734
He's the one I want to be
when I grow up.

1065
00:40:26,767 --> 00:40:28,000
When do you think
that will be?

1066
00:40:28,133 --> 00:40:29,800
It could happen any day now.

1067
00:40:29,934 --> 00:40:30,900
[laughs]

1068
00:40:31,033 --> 00:40:32,300
My Peter Pan.

1069
00:40:34,734 --> 00:40:36,100
Well, Peter,

1070
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:39,500
you have built a beautiful fort
all on your own,

1071
00:40:39,633 --> 00:40:41,467
you're making
this incredible meal

1072
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,266
for your chosen family,

1073
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,433
and you have yet
to burn that meal, so--

1074
00:40:45,567 --> 00:40:47,300
It's not burnt.

1075
00:40:47,433 --> 00:40:48,700
--I'd say
you did pretty good.

1076
00:40:48,834 --> 00:40:50,600
[♪]

1077
00:40:50,734 --> 00:40:52,533
L'Chaim.

1078
00:40:54,166 --> 00:40:55,200
L'Chaim.

1079
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:56,867
[clinking glasses]

1080
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,233
-Well, it is delicious
-Absolutely!

1081
00:41:03,367 --> 00:41:06,066
-Who did the bean salad?
-I did not make that.

1082
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,600
Oh, I brought the bean salad.
It's store-bought.

1083
00:41:08,734 --> 00:41:11,533
-Oh!
-[laughter]

1084
00:41:26,367 --> 00:41:28,533
"For Sarah, Night Three."

1085
00:41:28,667 --> 00:41:31,433
"I picture you and I smile."

1086
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:52,567
Well, whoever you are,

1087
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,166
you certainly have my attention.

1088
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:02,367
[Esther]
This guy is three-for-three.

1089
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,433
[laughs]

1090
00:42:04,867 --> 00:42:06,600
Mom, I just spent an hour

1091
00:42:06,734 --> 00:42:09,600
going through about
a million photos of our family

1092
00:42:09,734 --> 00:42:13,266
trying to find the right one
to go in that frame, and...

1093
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,500
[sighs]

1094
00:42:14,633 --> 00:42:15,767
I realized

1095
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:20,166
the picture I'm looking for
hasn't even been taken yet.

1096
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:24,633
I want a picture of my family.

1097
00:42:24,767 --> 00:42:27,100
You know, my husband.

1098
00:42:27,233 --> 00:42:29,834
My kids.

1099
00:42:31,266 --> 00:42:33,300
I didn't realize
how much I wanted that

1100
00:42:33,433 --> 00:42:34,467
until now.

1101
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,700
That's turning out to be
quite some gift.

1102
00:42:39,333 --> 00:42:41,800
It sure is.

1103
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:42,900
[sighs]

1104
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,967
[♪]

1105
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,633
There we go.

1106
00:42:50,767 --> 00:42:53,400
We'll put up the rest
of the decorations tomorrow.

1107
00:42:53,533 --> 00:42:55,300
I should go get cleaned up.

1108
00:42:55,433 --> 00:42:57,300
Where are you going?

1109
00:42:57,433 --> 00:43:00,567
I'm having dinner
with Sarah and her family.

1110
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,400
You guys are really tight, huh?

1111
00:43:02,533 --> 00:43:04,133
Since I was a kid.

1112
00:43:04,266 --> 00:43:06,066
And you and Sarah
are just friends?

1113
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,066
[sighs]

1114
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,867
I don't know.
I don't know what we are.

1115
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,500
That's what I thought.

1116
00:43:10,633 --> 00:43:12,100
You'd better make your move

1117
00:43:12,233 --> 00:43:13,667
before she falls
for this other guy.

1118
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,734
What other guy?

1119
00:43:14,867 --> 00:43:17,066
The guy who's giving her
all the gifts!

1120
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,900
I'm not worried about him.

1121
00:43:19,033 --> 00:43:20,300
Maybe you should be.

1122
00:43:20,433 --> 00:43:21,533
Believe me, if I lose her,

1123
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:23,066
it will not be to him.

1124
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,166
And how do you know that?

1125
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,633
'Cause I'm the guy!

1126
00:43:27,066 --> 00:43:28,233
Oh!

1127
00:43:28,367 --> 00:43:29,166
Wow!

1128
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,200
Yeah, I know.

1129
00:43:31,333 --> 00:43:33,834
So what happens now?

1130
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,700
I have five more nights

1131
00:43:36,834 --> 00:43:38,066
and five more gifts

1132
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,300
to see if we're bashert.

1133
00:43:39,433 --> 00:43:40,900
To see if you're what now?

1134
00:43:42,133 --> 00:43:43,333
Meant to be.

1135
00:43:45,433 --> 00:43:47,166
"Bashert."

1136
00:43:54,333 --> 00:43:55,367
[doorbell rings]

1137
00:44:01,266 --> 00:44:02,233
Hey.

1138
00:44:03,767 --> 00:44:05,700
I like Hanukkah already.

1139
00:44:05,834 --> 00:44:06,734
[Sarah laughs]

1140
00:44:06,867 --> 00:44:07,633
Come on in.

1141
00:44:07,767 --> 00:44:09,266
Great, thanks.

1142
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:11,967
Uh, for you.

1143
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,233
Oh, thanks.

1144
00:44:13,367 --> 00:44:14,433
No worries.

1145
00:44:14,567 --> 00:44:17,633
So, um, we can go over
the menus right in here.

1146
00:44:17,767 --> 00:44:19,767
Oh, wow.

1147
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:21,266
They're so beautiful,

1148
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,767
-Oh.
-And so many.

1149
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,100
Yeah. [laughs]

1150
00:44:26,233 --> 00:44:28,300
It's a lot, I know.

1151
00:44:28,433 --> 00:44:29,834
My grandma collected them.

1152
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:31,567
Some of them are very old.

1153
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:32,633
Huh.

1154
00:44:32,767 --> 00:44:35,567
So much history.

1155
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:36,567
Mm-hmm.

1156
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,800
So many memories.

1157
00:44:38,934 --> 00:44:42,333
Well, hopefully,
tonight you'll make some more.

1158
00:44:42,467 --> 00:44:43,567
Yeah.

1159
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:44,667
I hope so.

1160
00:44:46,033 --> 00:44:47,266
I was thinking
that I'd bake the falafel,

1161
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,567
rather than deep fry it.

1162
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:49,900
Oh, I don't know about that.

1163
00:44:50,033 --> 00:44:50,934
It's Hanukkah,

1164
00:44:51,066 --> 00:44:53,467
you're gonna deep fry it
in deep oil.

1165
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,133
Mm-hmm, yup.

1166
00:44:55,266 --> 00:44:56,133
You're the boss.

1167
00:44:56,266 --> 00:44:57,333
[laughs]

1168
00:44:57,467 --> 00:45:00,800
Hey, thank you so much
for catering this event.

1169
00:45:00,934 --> 00:45:03,300
Honestly, you're saving
our tuches.

1170
00:45:03,433 --> 00:45:05,500
Well, it's my pleasure.

1171
00:45:05,633 --> 00:45:06,533
Yeah, it gives me an opportunity

1172
00:45:06,667 --> 00:45:08,633
to broaden my horizons
as a chef...

1173
00:45:08,767 --> 00:45:09,867
That's true.

1174
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,934
...and to see more of you.

1175
00:45:13,967 --> 00:45:15,834
Hello?
Anybody home?

1176
00:45:15,967 --> 00:45:18,333
Yes, Mom, we're in here.

1177
00:45:18,467 --> 00:45:20,066
Oh, sorry we're late.

1178
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,367
Dad's parking the car.

1179
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,066
I got held up in court.

1180
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,000
Yeah, Mom's a judge, so...

1181
00:45:24,133 --> 00:45:25,400
Well, that makes sense.

1182
00:45:25,533 --> 00:45:28,900
You're Nigel Templeton,
the chef.

1183
00:45:29,033 --> 00:45:30,400
Guilty as charged.

1184
00:45:30,533 --> 00:45:32,033
I've heard so much about you.

1185
00:45:32,166 --> 00:45:33,433
Oh, Mom.
Shush.

1186
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,667
Well, thank you so much

1187
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,967
for, you know,

1188
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,533
sharing some of your Hanukkah
celebrations with me.

1189
00:45:38,667 --> 00:45:40,200
Well, a lot of the action
takes place in the kitchen.

1190
00:45:40,333 --> 00:45:42,033
Cooking and holidays
go hand in hand.

1191
00:45:42,166 --> 00:45:43,900
You can't have one
without the other.

1192
00:45:44,033 --> 00:45:44,834
Right?

1193
00:45:44,967 --> 00:45:46,166
[chuckles warmly]

1194
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,100
So I'm sitting there,

1195
00:45:50,233 --> 00:45:52,233
waiting for Zoey to finish up
at the climbing gym,

1196
00:45:52,367 --> 00:45:54,166
and I bumped into
an old girlfriend of yours.

1197
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:55,166
Okay?

1198
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:56,166
Susan Kramer.

1199
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:57,700
-Susan Kramer!
-Mm-hmm.

1200
00:45:57,834 --> 00:45:58,700
Susan Kramer.

1201
00:45:58,834 --> 00:46:00,367
She says to say hello.

1202
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,700
Okay.

1203
00:46:01,834 --> 00:46:02,934
-What?
-What are you getting at.

1204
00:46:03,066 --> 00:46:04,633
I always liked her.
Whatever happened with that?

1205
00:46:04,767 --> 00:46:06,867
I always liked her, too,
she just wasn't the one.

1206
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,900
Where have I heard
that before?

1207
00:46:09,033 --> 00:46:09,934
-What is with this voice?
-What voice?

1208
00:46:10,066 --> 00:46:11,433
We're about to have
Hanukkah dinner,

1209
00:46:11,567 --> 00:46:12,734
just cut me some slack.

1210
00:46:12,867 --> 00:46:14,333
I'm just saying, man.

1211
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,300
Look, if I'm going
to marry someone,

1212
00:46:18,433 --> 00:46:22,133
if I'm going
to have kids with someone,

1213
00:46:22,266 --> 00:46:23,934
it's gotta be the right one.

1214
00:46:24,066 --> 00:46:25,500
I get that.

1215
00:46:28,367 --> 00:46:30,133
Come on.

1216
00:46:36,233 --> 00:46:37,433
Hey, where is the Zoesh?

1217
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:39,900
She's having dinner
with Ava's parents.

1218
00:46:42,867 --> 00:46:45,767
By the way,
we've got company tonight.

1219
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,066
Oh, who?

1220
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,400
[with British accent]
Sarah's good friend, Nigel.

1221
00:46:49,567 --> 00:46:50,433
Swell.

1222
00:46:50,567 --> 00:46:52,100
Here you go.

1223
00:46:52,233 --> 00:46:53,934
I make my kugel with raisins.

1224
00:46:54,066 --> 00:46:55,200
Lovely.

1225
00:46:55,333 --> 00:46:57,233
I, if there's no objection,

1226
00:46:57,367 --> 00:46:59,400
might add some currants
plumped in port

1227
00:46:59,533 --> 00:47:00,533
for the Mazel Ball.

1228
00:47:00,667 --> 00:47:02,000
Ooh, objection overruled.

1229
00:47:02,133 --> 00:47:03,000
Hey!

1230
00:47:03,133 --> 00:47:04,734
Oh, busted.

1231
00:47:06,166 --> 00:47:07,033
Hi!

1232
00:47:07,166 --> 00:47:08,767
-Oh, hey!
-Hey.

1233
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,233
-We brought wine.
-Good.

1234
00:47:10,367 --> 00:47:11,834
Nigel,

1235
00:47:11,967 --> 00:47:13,200
you remember
my friend, Daniel...

1236
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:14,834
Of course.
Great to see you again.

1237
00:47:14,967 --> 00:47:16,700
Yeah, you too.

1238
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,000
...and that's my brother, Jake.

1239
00:47:18,133 --> 00:47:19,800
Nice to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

1240
00:47:19,934 --> 00:47:21,500
-Easy there.
-Right.

1241
00:47:21,633 --> 00:47:23,200
Well, now that we're all here,

1242
00:47:23,333 --> 00:47:25,066
why don't we light the Menorah?

1243
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,300
Gentlemen?

1244
00:47:26,433 --> 00:47:27,333
Let's do it.

1245
00:47:27,467 --> 00:47:28,533
This is from, uh,
from both of us.

1246
00:47:28,667 --> 00:47:30,500
Oh, nice.

1247
00:47:30,633 --> 00:47:34,533
That's actually one of
my favorite traditions.

1248
00:47:34,667 --> 00:47:37,467
What do you like most
about Hanukkah?

1249
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,333
Probably the fact
that every night,

1250
00:47:40,467 --> 00:47:42,433
a little more light
comes into our lives, you know?

1251
00:47:42,567 --> 00:47:44,500
Yeah.

1252
00:47:44,633 --> 00:47:45,934
Well, I've got to say,

1253
00:47:46,066 --> 00:47:48,300
I am liking this night
quite a bit.

1254
00:47:48,433 --> 00:47:49,967
Me too.

1255
00:47:51,133 --> 00:47:52,166
Well, cheers.

1256
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:53,567
Cheers.

1257
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:57,166
This is so good.

1258
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:58,333
It's so good.

1259
00:47:58,467 --> 00:48:01,100
It's a shame Nigel
couldn't stay for dessert.

1260
00:48:01,233 --> 00:48:02,233
Yeah.

1261
00:48:02,367 --> 00:48:03,567
He had to get to back
to the restaurant,

1262
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,333
but you'll see him
at the Mazel Ball,

1263
00:48:05,467 --> 00:48:06,567
don't you worry.

1264
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:07,834
I can't wait to see

1265
00:48:07,967 --> 00:48:10,066
what a Michelin-star chef does
with a Hanukkah menu.

1266
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,433
-Mm-hmm.
-I know.

1267
00:48:12,567 --> 00:48:14,333
Nigel really is a charmer.

1268
00:48:14,467 --> 00:48:15,400
[Sarah] Isn't he?

1269
00:48:15,533 --> 00:48:17,433
Pass me--

1270
00:48:17,567 --> 00:48:19,233
Pass me the rugelach?

1271
00:48:19,367 --> 00:48:21,166
-How many do you want?
-Just... all of it.

1272
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:22,567
You're gonna eat all of them?

1273
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:23,633
[laughing]

1274
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:24,834
You okay, Daniel?

1275
00:48:24,967 --> 00:48:26,700
You've been kinda quiet tonight.

1276
00:48:26,834 --> 00:48:28,533
Just thinking about stuff.

1277
00:48:28,667 --> 00:48:30,000
What stuff?

1278
00:48:30,133 --> 00:48:32,533
Like moving to Aspen.

1279
00:48:34,567 --> 00:48:36,500
-What?
-What?

1280
00:48:36,633 --> 00:48:37,700
What, he didn't tell you?

1281
00:48:37,834 --> 00:48:40,500
I didn't tell anyone.

1282
00:48:40,633 --> 00:48:41,600
Well, you told Jacob.

1283
00:48:41,734 --> 00:48:44,166
Well, I was there
when he got the offer.

1284
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:45,266
What offer?

1285
00:48:46,734 --> 00:48:50,633
The developer wants Daniel
to build seven houses in Aspen.

1286
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,700
Wow.

1287
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:58,734
Why didn't you say anything?

1288
00:48:58,867 --> 00:49:01,533
My home is in Seattle.

1289
00:49:03,033 --> 00:49:06,734
Moving away
would be really hard on me.

1290
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,633
When do you have to
make a decision?

1291
00:49:11,767 --> 00:49:13,166
I have to tell them next week.

1292
00:49:17,133 --> 00:49:19,867
I'd really miss you.

1293
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,166
Yeah.

1294
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,767
I'd miss you, too.

1295
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,400
But I--
I want what's best for you.

1296
00:49:26,533 --> 00:49:28,133
Thanks.

1297
00:49:28,266 --> 00:49:29,266
Yeah.

1298
00:49:33,567 --> 00:49:34,633
[laughing]

1299
00:49:34,767 --> 00:49:36,834
Okay, yeah, I will.

1300
00:49:36,967 --> 00:49:38,100
Have a good night.

1301
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,767
[Daniel] You owe me ten bucks.

1302
00:49:46,767 --> 00:49:48,266
[Sarah] We start
with deep-fried falafel--

1303
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,300
[Esther] It's gonna be good

1304
00:49:49,433 --> 00:49:50,500
[Sarah]
--and then the Israeli salad.

1305
00:49:50,633 --> 00:49:51,734
-Ooh, I like that.
-Mm-hmm.

1306
00:49:51,867 --> 00:49:53,800
I'm going to use
my own latke recipe.

1307
00:49:53,934 --> 00:49:55,000
Yeah, that's not happening...

1308
00:49:55,133 --> 00:49:57,133
Look what I found
on the porch.

1309
00:49:57,266 --> 00:50:01,266
Sarah, your secret admirer
strikes again.

1310
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,100
"For Sarah, Night Four.

1311
00:50:03,233 --> 00:50:06,033
When I'm with you,
time stands still."

1312
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:08,900
[chuckling warmly]

1313
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:12,000
[gasping]

1314
00:50:12,133 --> 00:50:14,266
Oh, Sarah, that's gorgeous.

1315
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,400
-Wow.
-And so you.

1316
00:50:16,533 --> 00:50:20,266
Well, I am never
taking this off.

1317
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,233
Hey, do you think
it's from Nigel?

1318
00:50:22,367 --> 00:50:24,333
The card is so romantic.

1319
00:50:24,467 --> 00:50:25,633
It could be anybody.

1320
00:50:25,767 --> 00:50:28,300
But how many anybodies
are there?

1321
00:50:28,433 --> 00:50:31,100
Well, there's Adam,

1322
00:50:31,233 --> 00:50:33,266
Tom,

1323
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,734
Nigel,

1324
00:50:34,867 --> 00:50:35,734
Paul...

1325
00:50:35,867 --> 00:50:36,834
[Jacob] Paul?

1326
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:40,800
Yeah, he's been making
subtle advances.

1327
00:50:40,934 --> 00:50:42,600
Maybe not so subtle.

1328
00:50:42,734 --> 00:50:44,133
Okay, you.

1329
00:50:44,266 --> 00:50:47,000
You have seen me
with all these guys.

1330
00:50:47,133 --> 00:50:48,767
Who do you think it is?

1331
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:51,767
The possibilities are endless.

1332
00:50:53,934 --> 00:50:54,767
Well, the nice thing is,

1333
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:55,934
I have about, um,

1334
00:50:56,066 --> 00:50:57,667
four more nights
to figure that out.

1335
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:58,767
[laughing]

1336
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:01,467
I think you're falling
for this guy.

1337
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,000
Yup.

1338
00:51:04,133 --> 00:51:06,166
He had me at the roses.

1339
00:51:11,834 --> 00:51:13,200
[sighs]

1340
00:51:13,333 --> 00:51:15,633
[insistent knocking on door]

1341
00:51:29,967 --> 00:51:30,667
Hey.

1342
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:31,567
Mind if I come in?

1343
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,667
Uh... sure.

1344
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,400
[panting]

1345
00:51:35,533 --> 00:51:37,233
Are you okay?

1346
00:51:37,367 --> 00:51:39,233
There's something
I need to tell you.

1347
00:51:39,367 --> 00:51:41,467
Okay.

1348
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:45,166
Am I supposed to guess
what it is?

1349
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:46,333
[stammers]

1350
00:51:46,467 --> 00:51:47,433
[laughing nervously]

1351
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,934
You need to know...

1352
00:51:53,834 --> 00:51:55,300
Yeah?

1353
00:51:58,867 --> 00:52:01,900
I'm so sorry I didn't
tell you about Aspen.

1354
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,233
Oh.

1355
00:52:04,367 --> 00:52:05,300
Yeah.

1356
00:52:05,433 --> 00:52:07,200
I don't know what
I'm going to do yet--

1357
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:08,433
You don't need to apologize--

1358
00:52:08,567 --> 00:52:09,934
--and I didn't want to say
anything prematurely--

1359
00:52:10,066 --> 00:52:11,066
I'm not mad at you, I just--

1360
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,166
I'm just going to miss you,
that's all.

1361
00:52:15,066 --> 00:52:16,700
Me too.

1362
00:52:19,867 --> 00:52:22,433
Well, I'm really glad
you're here.

1363
00:52:22,567 --> 00:52:23,800
Yeah?

1364
00:52:23,934 --> 00:52:26,066
Yeah.

1365
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:31,033
I, uh, I actually have
a confession to make.

1366
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:33,100
You do?

1367
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:35,166
[sighs heavily]

1368
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:36,934
Pretty sure I'm going
to embarrass myself--

1369
00:52:37,066 --> 00:52:38,600
No, no...

1370
00:52:38,734 --> 00:52:39,867
I-I don't think so.

1371
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,600
Oh, I'm sure of it.

1372
00:52:41,734 --> 00:52:43,100
Okay, um...

1373
00:52:43,233 --> 00:52:46,000
Okay, do you remember
dance class in sixth grade?

1374
00:52:47,367 --> 00:52:48,533
Kinda.

1375
00:52:48,667 --> 00:52:51,567
You remember me
not being able to dance?

1376
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:52,433
You were terrible.
It was hard to watch.

1377
00:52:52,567 --> 00:52:53,266
Terrible.

1378
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,467
Hard to watch. Still is.

1379
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,467
Scary bad.

1380
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,300
-Mm-hmm, still is.
-Even for a kid.

1381
00:52:57,433 --> 00:52:59,467
What am I gonna do
at the Ball?

1382
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,834
Stand around, lookin' fine!

1383
00:53:06,967 --> 00:53:08,333

1384
00:53:08,467 --> 00:53:09,400
What?

1385
00:53:09,533 --> 00:53:11,133
I'm the co-chair,

1386
00:53:11,266 --> 00:53:12,834
and I hired my brother's band.

1387
00:53:12,967 --> 00:53:15,467
I mean, people
are going to be looking.

1388
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,500
Come on, you have to help me.

1389
00:53:16,633 --> 00:53:17,467

1390
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,333
All right, relax, okay?

00:53:19,467 --> 00:53:20,333
-Okay.
-Relax.

1392
00:53:20,467 --> 00:53:21,433
Can you move this?
It's heavy.

1393
00:53:23,467 --> 00:53:25,033
Okay. [straining]

I don't know what that is.

Okay, you know what?

1417
00:53:58,934 --> 00:54:00,266
I think

1418
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,467
that I should just, um,
stick to swaying.

You should just stick

-Yeah, look at you.

Did something happen
last night?

1438
00:54:50,967 --> 00:54:52,867
Sarah was talking about
all the guys

1439
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,834
who might be giving her
the gifts,

1440
00:54:54,967 --> 00:54:56,800
including her ex.

1441
00:54:56,934 --> 00:55:00,200
It didn't even occur to her
that it might be me.

1442
00:55:00,333 --> 00:55:02,600
Well, here's a radical notion--
why don't you just tell her?

1443
00:55:02,734 --> 00:55:04,533
I almost did. Okay?

1444
00:55:04,667 --> 00:55:06,133
I got all the way home,

1445
00:55:06,266 --> 00:55:07,633
and then I went back there.

1446
00:55:07,767 --> 00:55:09,967
I just...

1447
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:11,900
I just couldn't do it.

1448
00:55:12,033 --> 00:55:13,033
Why not?

00:55:13,166 --> 00:55:14,133
It's complicated.

1450
00:55:14,266 --> 00:55:15,600
Yeah, I'm getting that.

1451
00:55:15,734 --> 00:55:17,900
Sarah was always
Jacob's little sister to me.

1452
00:55:18,033 --> 00:55:19,600
One day, I looked up,

1453
00:55:19,734 --> 00:55:21,266
the pigtails were gone,

1454
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,100
and she was a woman,

1455
00:55:23,233 --> 00:55:24,633
one I really liked.

1456
00:55:24,767 --> 00:55:26,100
But you didn't tell her.

1457
00:55:26,233 --> 00:55:28,300
By the time I realized
how I felt,

1458
00:55:28,433 --> 00:55:30,033
she was with Paul.

1459
00:55:30,166 --> 00:55:31,734
The not-so-ex-boyfriend.

1460
00:55:31,867 --> 00:55:35,467
And when they broke up,
I thought that was my chance.

1461
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,200
Here's what I don't get,

1462
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:38,867
why do you have to do it
anonymously?

1463
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:39,900
I don't know.

1464
00:55:40,033 --> 00:55:41,066
I didn't know
where to start with her,

1465
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,533
after being friends for so long.

1466
00:55:43,667 --> 00:55:45,967
I felt like I had to do
something special.

1467
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:47,700
I mean, Sarah's not just
someone you date.

1468
00:55:47,834 --> 00:55:49,433
You know?

1469
00:55:49,567 --> 00:55:51,867
She's the one you end up with.

1470
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,200
Forever can be scary.

1471
00:55:54,333 --> 00:55:55,300
What I didn't see coming

1472
00:55:55,433 --> 00:55:59,100
was all these other guys
getting in the way.

1473
00:55:59,233 --> 00:56:02,667
Now it's becoming a test.

1474
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:06,200
I want her
to figure out it's me.

1475
00:56:06,333 --> 00:56:08,367
Well, we're only
halfway through Hanukkah.

1476
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,734
Give her a chance.

1477
00:56:12,467 --> 00:56:15,367
It's beautiful.

1478
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,266
The mystery man is no fool.

1479
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:18,266
Every time
you look at that watch,

1480
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,333
you're going to think of him.

1481
00:56:19,467 --> 00:56:22,000
And I don't even know
who it is yet.

1482
00:56:22,133 --> 00:56:23,266
Adam.

1483
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,300
You think it's Adam?

1484
00:56:25,433 --> 00:56:27,967
I know it's him.

1485
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:28,800
Hey.

1486
00:56:28,934 --> 00:56:30,867
-Hey.
-You're here.

1487
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,633
Uh, yeah, I was just
in the neighborhood

1488
00:56:33,767 --> 00:56:35,433
and wondered if you'd like
to go for lunch.

1489
00:56:36,934 --> 00:56:38,600
Lunch.

1490
00:56:38,734 --> 00:56:41,700
Uh... you know what,

1491
00:56:41,834 --> 00:56:43,633
I don't know
if I'm ready for lunch,

1492
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:45,834
It's only 11:45.

1493
00:56:45,967 --> 00:56:47,667
That's a nice watch.

1494
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,500
You think? Huh.

1495
00:56:49,633 --> 00:56:50,700
I just got it.

1496
00:56:50,834 --> 00:56:53,266
It was a Hanukkah gift.

1497
00:56:54,166 --> 00:56:55,133
So, what do you think?

1498
00:56:55,266 --> 00:56:56,600
About the watch?

1499
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,433
About lunch.

1500
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:01,266
Lunch.

1501
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:04,033
Okay, I actually can't
right now.

1502
00:57:04,166 --> 00:57:05,600
I'm a little swamped.

1503
00:57:05,734 --> 00:57:08,734
We're setting up
this fundraiser for kids,

1504
00:57:08,867 --> 00:57:11,533
and I still have
a lot of toys to find, so...

1505
00:57:11,667 --> 00:57:13,066
Well, I can get you
any toy you need.

1506
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,233
Yeah, I developed a software

1507
00:57:15,367 --> 00:57:18,033
for talking teddy bears
and all kinds of automated toys.

1508
00:57:18,166 --> 00:57:19,367
Let me know when and where.

1509
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,400
Okay.

1510
00:57:21,533 --> 00:57:23,400
The Hanukkah Hunt
is tomorrow.

1511
00:57:23,533 --> 00:57:25,100
Not a problem.

1512
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:28,567
So, Adam and I are going
to come by your place

1513
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:30,200
tomorrow morning--

1514
00:57:30,333 --> 00:57:31,400
[playfully] Kssh!

1515
00:57:31,533 --> 00:57:34,266
--and he is bringing
all these incredible toys.

1516
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,533
It's so adorable.

1517
00:57:35,667 --> 00:57:36,734
He's so into it.

1518
00:57:36,867 --> 00:57:38,066
That's so nice of him.

1519
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,367
It is!

1520
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:40,567
It's so nice.

1521
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:43,233
He's got this real,
just generous nature to him,

1522
00:57:43,367 --> 00:57:44,266
you know?

1523
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,967
Mm-hmm.

1524
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,367
-Hey.
-Hey.

1525
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,000
Tom Sherman
is coming by later

1526
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,266
to pick up his new glasses.

1527
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:54,367
Tom, the likable, dependable
co-chair of the committee?

1528
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,333
Yeah, that one.

1529
00:57:55,467 --> 00:57:56,834
Yeah, he is all those things,

1530
00:57:56,967 --> 00:57:57,867
and he's a patient.

1531
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:58,734
Are you okay?

1532
00:57:58,867 --> 00:57:59,600
Sorry. I'm okay.

1533
00:57:59,734 --> 00:58:00,667
I don't know why I said that.

1534
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:01,667
He's a good guy.

1535
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:02,967
He is a good guy.

1536
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:04,800
He thinks he may need
a new prescription.

1537
00:58:04,934 --> 00:58:06,266
Okay.

1538
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,433
Um, who's in Exam Room 1?

1539
00:58:18,433 --> 00:58:19,767
Hmm.

1540
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:21,800
Maybe you should get
an eye exam.

1541
00:58:21,934 --> 00:58:24,734
But I don't wear glasses.

1542
00:58:24,867 --> 00:58:26,734
Maybe you should start.

1543
00:58:34,867 --> 00:58:35,934
Okay.

1544
00:58:36,066 --> 00:58:37,400
Get comfy.

1545
00:58:37,533 --> 00:58:38,667
Yeah, super comfy.

1546
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:39,567
[laughs]

1547
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:40,900
Are you nervous?

1548
00:58:41,033 --> 00:58:42,266
Am I nervous?

1549
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,767
I don't think so.

1550
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:45,967
Okay, just, um,
place your chin right there.

1551
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:46,800
Here?

1552
00:58:46,934 --> 00:58:47,767
Mm-hmm.

1553
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:48,700
Try not to move.

1554
00:58:48,834 --> 00:58:49,567
I'm not moving.

1555
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:51,600
Okay.

1556
00:58:51,734 --> 00:58:54,066
All right, now, look up...

1557
00:58:58,467 --> 00:59:01,033
[laughs]

1558
00:59:01,166 --> 00:59:02,633
This feels weird.

1559
00:59:02,767 --> 00:59:03,667
What does?

1560
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:04,500
-[giggling]
-What?

1561
00:59:04,633 --> 00:59:06,133
Doing this with you.

1562
00:59:06,266 --> 00:59:07,233
Oh.

1563
00:59:07,367 --> 00:59:09,400
-Ah-ah! No moving.
-Sorry.

1564
00:59:09,533 --> 00:59:10,734
Okay.

1565
00:59:10,867 --> 00:59:13,433
Now look to the left...

1566
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,567
...and the right...

1567
00:59:18,834 --> 00:59:21,467
..and straight at me.

1568
00:59:24,333 --> 00:59:25,900
You okay?

1569
00:59:26,767 --> 00:59:28,467
What?

1570
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,667
What do you see?

1571
00:59:31,767 --> 00:59:32,734
I see you.

1572
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:36,567
Okay.

1573
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:39,400
Well, your eyes look fine.

1574
00:59:40,567 --> 00:59:42,967
Have you experienced any, um,

1575
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:46,367
difference in your eyesight
recently?

1576
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,500
It's hard to explain.

1577
00:59:48,633 --> 00:59:51,800
I feel like I wasn't
seeing things clearly.

1578
00:59:51,934 --> 00:59:53,633
What do you mean?
What kind of things?

1579
00:59:53,767 --> 00:59:55,867
The people around me,

1580
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,800
the road ahead...

1581
00:59:58,867 --> 01:00:00,166
When you're so close
to something,

1582
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:02,100
sometimes, you don't
really see it.

1583
01:00:05,367 --> 01:00:06,500
Well, that's very subjective.

1584
01:00:06,633 --> 01:00:08,633
Yeah, I don't know,

1585
01:00:08,767 --> 01:00:10,000
maybe it's all in my head,
right?

1586
01:00:10,133 --> 01:00:12,667
Well, I don't have
a diagnosis for that.

1587
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,900
So my eyes seem okay?

1588
01:00:15,033 --> 01:00:15,867
I'll live.

1589
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
[laughs]

1590
01:00:17,133 --> 01:00:18,500
Yeah. [clears throat]

1591
01:00:18,633 --> 01:00:19,967
Yeah, you're gonna make it.

1592
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:22,133
Good to know.

1593
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:39,800
[groaning with effort]
Okay...

1594
01:00:39,934 --> 01:00:41,600
Wow.

1595
01:00:41,734 --> 01:00:44,834
"For Sarah, Night Five.

1596
01:00:44,967 --> 01:00:48,400
The Tree of Life
will light my way to you."

1597
01:00:48,533 --> 01:00:51,900
This guy is almost
as wonderful as your father.

1598
01:00:52,033 --> 01:00:53,367
[sighs]

1599
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:54,467
Tell me about it.

1600
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,533
And the mystery continues.

1601
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:04,033
[sighs]

1602
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,200
Hi, Bubbe.

1603
01:01:09,867 --> 01:01:11,500
I think I'm in love.

1604
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:15,567
[sighs]

1605
01:01:16,734 --> 01:01:17,700
[groans]

1606
01:01:21,967 --> 01:01:23,000
-Oh, wow.
-Yeah?

1607
01:01:23,133 --> 01:01:24,500
-This looks incredible.
-It looks good, huh? Yeah.

1608
01:01:24,633 --> 01:01:27,367
Wow. Well done, Jimmy.

1609
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:30,367
You understand
that this used to be us.

1610
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:33,200
I mean, we were the kids
running around,

1611
01:01:33,333 --> 01:01:36,000
looking for
shiny gold coins everywhere.

1612
01:01:36,133 --> 01:01:37,166
So many Hanukkah Hunts.

1613
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:38,934
So many skinned knees
looking for Gelt.

1614
01:01:39,066 --> 01:01:39,867
[laughs]

1615
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,533
The good old days.

1616
01:01:41,667 --> 01:01:43,266
You do realize I let you win.

1617
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,367
Mm-hmm.

1618
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:47,033
-You did not.
-Mm-hmm.

1619
01:01:47,166 --> 01:01:48,734
You really think
that jar of Gelt

1620
01:01:48,867 --> 01:01:51,033
just happened to be lying around
in plain sight?

1621
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:52,600
They were under a tree.

1622
01:01:52,734 --> 01:01:53,667
That had no leaves.

1623
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:54,967
The leaves were on the ground,

1624
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:56,266
covering the coins.

1625
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:57,367
That I let you find.

1626
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:58,633
[growls in frustration]

1627
01:01:58,767 --> 01:02:00,567
[car horn honks outside]

1628
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:02,633
Ah, that must be Adam.

1629
01:02:03,667 --> 01:02:04,767
Adam?

1630
01:02:07,367 --> 01:02:08,333
Yeah.

1631
01:02:08,467 --> 01:02:09,667
Wow.

1632
01:02:12,834 --> 01:02:15,600
That is incredible.

1633
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:17,900
I'm gonna go thank him.

1634
01:02:18,033 --> 01:02:19,667
Do I look okay?

1635
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:21,100
You look...

1636
01:02:21,233 --> 01:02:22,200
you look great.

1637
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:28,533
[voices murmuring in distance]

1638
