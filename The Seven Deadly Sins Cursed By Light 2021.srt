3
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:13,930
Let's get started then.

4
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:17,350
Their presence

5
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:18,935
<i>and desires</i>

6
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,395
<i>have granted me power.</i>

7
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:25,692
<i>You will be mine forever now!</i>

8
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:27,986
<i>You promised!</i>

9
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,196
<i>You said you would protect her!</i>

10
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:35,368
<i>I'm glad we are together at the end.</i>

11
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:38,997
<i>Thank you.</i>

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,124
You guided me to the right path.

13
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:45,336
<i>I cannot allow myself to lose</i>

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,088
any more precious people.

15
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:52,677
<i>My friends. I can finally fulfill my vow.</i>

16
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,764
More than anyone else in the world,

17
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,432
<i>I believe in you.</i>

18
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,809
<i>Everyone. Let's go!</i>

19
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:07,108
{\an8}DEMON REALM

20
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,667
-What?
-What?

21
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:25,585
-What?
-What?

22
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,296
Enemy attack!

23
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,017
Attack!

24
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,707
Release the Indura!

25
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,043
-But…
-We have no choice.

26
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:19,848
What?

27
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,480
Take this!

28
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:00,138
Let them live.

29
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,224
Right.

30
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,311
That will make things easier for us.

31
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,149
Time for them to pay
for squandering the Holy War.

32
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,401
The Seven Deadly Sins.

33
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:23,620
What?

34
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,330
This is the place!

35
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,749
Wow, this brings back memories!

36
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:30,835
What? Look, Meliodas.

37
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,046
Do you remember that large waterfall?

38
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:36,841
Yes. When you were a merchant's daughter,

39
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,343
you fell from it twice.

40
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:39,886
That's right!

41
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,680
You jumped into the water to save me!

42
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:46,809
After our clothes got soaked,
we tried to dry them.

43
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,354
It was just then that we found
a cave behind the waterfall!

44
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:53,900
We built a fire and warmed our
bodies with wine.

45
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:57,654
Then you got completely drunk.

46
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:00,865
Did that really happen?

47
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:07,080
<i>Six months have passed since the
Seven Deadly Sins fought the Demon King.</i>

48
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,748
<i>Meliodas and I</i>

49
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,292
<i>have begun going on short trips.</i>

50
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,380
<i>Are you serious, Meliodas?</i>

51
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,633
<i>Will you really become King with
Elizabeth as your Queen?</i>

52
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:23,137
Sure thing! I owe you a lot.

53
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:27,141
I see. You've finally made your decision.

54
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,270
We must arrange the ceremony
for your crowning.

55
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:31,896
No need for all that.

56
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,399
It's your first duty as King.

57
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:38,695
{\an8}That bothersome stuff
just doesn't fit me right.

58
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:42,323
{\an8}This is just a prelude to the
grander ceremonies to come.

59
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,158
The appointment of Holy Knights.

60
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,119
Negotiations with other states.

61
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,745
There are countless others!

62
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,789
First, for our honeymoon,

63
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:53,751
{\an8}I plan to take a casual trip
around Britannia with Elizabeth.

64
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:57,130
{\an8}Wait just a minute!
The King doesn't have time for that!

65
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,549
Then I guess I won't be the King.

66
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,633
What?

67
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,635
What did you just say?

68
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:06,389
Lying to the King is a grave offense!

69
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,266
Father, calm down.

70
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:11,227
I'm just leaving it to you
until we get back from our trip.

71
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,145
What?

72
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,731
I'll do it earnestly once I get back.

73
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,816
I'll be a proper King.

74
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,402
Father.

75
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,823
{\an8}I want to take a trip before
becoming the Queen of Liones too.

76
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:28,369
{\an8}I want to visit the nostalgic places
Meliodas and I spent together

77
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,912
{\an8}for 3,000 years.

78
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,085
Once this trip is over, we'll get married

79
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,672
and become a real family.

80
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:40,590
Right.

81
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:45,595
Even though we've been together
3,000 years, it feels odd.

82
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,016
Family, huh?

83
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,144
I don't really understand

84
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,022
what being a family should feel like.

85
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:59,025
You know how my father is.

86
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:03,613
{\an8}I wasn't a very good big brother
to Zeldris either.

87
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:08,701
In fact, all I did was cause him pain.

88
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,162
You can still do it.

89
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,665
We have plenty of time.

90
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:18,419
I'm sure you'll have a chance
to make things right with Zeldris!

91
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,756
Elizabeth.

92
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,885
What's wrong?

93
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,846
I feel magic from the pool
beneath the waterfall.

94
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,849
Extremely powerful magic.

95
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,649
Gelda, look!

96
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:42,443
Fish in this world
are smaller than in the Demon Realm.

97
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:45,029
But they look really fatty and delicious!

98
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,742
It seems you're in a good mood.

99
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,702
Of course!

100
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,622
If I can fill my belly with delicious food

101
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:58,209
my blood will taste better
when you feed on me!

102
00:06:58,751 --> 00:06:59,710
Don't you agree?

103
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,466
You are so cute.

104
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,346
Gelda…

105
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,765
I am being serious.

106
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,517
Sorry to interrupt.

107
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,270
Excuse us.

108
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,400
Why the heck are you here?

109
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:25,027
We're allowed to go anywhere we want.

110
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,115
Why are you still in the human world?

111
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:32,243
Weren't you going to return to
the Demon Realm to become Demon King?

112
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,954
{\an8}You have no right to judge me!

113
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,122
{\an8}Zel.

114
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:40,501
That harsh tone isn't appropriate
when speaking to your older brother.

115
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:43,880
You and I are only together now

116
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,132
thanks to Meliodas.

117
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:51,262
Meliodas. I humbly ask…

118
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:55,099
your purpose for coming to this place.

119
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:01,355
So you're on a trip together
before you take the throne.

120
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:03,983
What is it?

121
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,862
-This is tasty!
-I'm just thinking how similar they are.

122
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,406
-I'll give it back!
-Are they really similar?

123
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,575
Indeed.

124
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:15,036
Zeldris said that before
he became Demon King

125
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:17,914
he wanted to spend some alone
time with me to fool around.

126
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,124
I didn't say that much!

127
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,501
I just said that

128
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:25,046
I wanted to enjoy my time with you
before I became Demon King!

129
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,672
That's pretty much the same thing.

130
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,677
I guess it makes sense that
siblings think of the same things.

131
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,556
I don't think of you as a brother.

132
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,933
It disgusts me!

133
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,440
I feel one small magic source.

134
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,360
No. This is…

135
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,029
Almost extinguished.

136
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:55,618
Are you okay?

137
00:08:57,161 --> 00:09:01,040
You are Lord Zeldris.

138
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:02,792
Who did this to you?

139
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:07,380
The Demon Realm was attacked.

140
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,173
What?

141
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,259
Who was it? How many?

142
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:15,179
There was a Fairy and a Giant.

143
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,360
<i>This is a tale of ancient times,</i>

144
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:32,697
<i>when the human and non-human worlds</i>

145
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,657
<i>had not yet split.</i>

146
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,909
<i>After 3,000 years,</i>

147
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,245
<i>the Holy War broke out again.</i>

148
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:43,165
<i>Those that put an end to this
clash of light and darkness</i>

149
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,667
<i>were the Seven Deadly Sins.</i>

150
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,172
{\an8}<i>Dragon's Sin.</i>

151
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,217
{\an8}<i>Meliodas.</i>

152
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,845
<i>Serpent's Sin.</i>

153
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:00,474
{\an8}<i>Diane.</i>

154
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,436
<i>Fox's Sin.</i>

155
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:05,980
<i>Ban.</i>

156
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,149
<i>Grizzly's Sin.</i>

157
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:12,945
{\an8}<i>King.</i>

158
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,741
{\an8}<i>Goat's Sin.</i>

159
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:18,993
{\an8}<i>Gowther.</i>

160
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,912
{\an8}<i>Boar's Sin.</i>

161
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,291
{\an8}<i>Merlin.</i>

162
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,252
{\an8}<i>Lion's Sin.</i>

163
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,172
{\an8}<i>Escanor.</i>

164
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,091
<i>The people called them</i>

165
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,469
<i>the Seven Deadly Sins.</i>

166
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:52,485
{\an8}FAIRY KING'S FOREST

167
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,612
What do you think?

168
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:57,406
Diane is almost prepared.

169
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:00,660
Roger that!

170
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,828
Our preparations are done too.

171
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,331
His grooming and fitting are perfect.

172
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,126
Where is King Harlequin?

173
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,218
What hairstyle is the best?

174
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,303
Your necktie is crooked.

175
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:23,474
The Fairy King can't be
afraid of getting married.

176
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,851
Just be as you usually are.

177
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:30,981
Marriage is one of the most
important days of your life!

178
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,067
Especially to women!

179
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:36,445
If I mess up, she'll hate me forever!

180
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,365
I can't just act as I usually do!

181
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:43,160
-Diane would never hate you.
-What?

182
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:46,914
Diane loves you no matter how you are.

183
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,807
Thank you, Elaine.

184
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,060
Unbelievable.
What a pain of a brother-in-law.

185
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,061
Really.

186
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,318
Yes! All done!

187
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,490
It looks beautiful.

188
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,995
Everyone! You came!

189
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:30,583
It is an honor to be invited
to your wedding.

190
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,795
I bring words of congratulations
and a gift from King Bartra--

191
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,589
No need for all that.

192
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,800
This is just about feelings
and getting into the mood.

193
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,260
Getting into the mood?

194
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,973
I wish the Captain
and Elizabeth could have come too.

195
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,436
But they are on their honeymoon.
Such bad timing.

196
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,938
{\an8}NORTHERN BRITANNIA
KINGDOM OF LIONES

197
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,900
Wow! Amazing!

198
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:58,944
I've never seen the city so lively.

199
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,696
Indeed.

200
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,573
But it has to be lively.

201
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:06,577
After all, tomorrow is the crowning
of a new king.

202
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,872
And Elizabeth's wedding.

203
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,832
Are you really excited for that, Father?

204
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,752
Won't it make you sad?

205
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:18,756
Veronica! Think a little
about your father's feelings.

206
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,424
I'm just joking!

207
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,802
I must admit I feel a little sad about it.

208
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,306
But I believe Caroline, your mother,

209
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,851
is celebrating this in heaven.

210
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,398
Speaking of which, will they really

211
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:40,194
be back by tomorrow?

212
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,739
-You need to return to the Demon Realm?
-You need to return to the Demon Realm?

213
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:48,035
Yes. It seems something bad
is happening there.

214
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,788
Wait a second.
Why do you want to come too?

215
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:53,916
I'm already involved. I can't ignore this.

216
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,876
This is an issue of the Demon Realm!

217
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,086
I shall resolve it!

218
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,421
Calm down, both of you.

219
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,383
I'm sorry, Gelda.
Please wait here until I return.

220
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,718
I will not. I'm coming too.

221
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,220
But…

222
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,681
I'm sick of just waiting.

223
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,395
Fine. Let's go together.

224
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:19,567
It seems like that poor fellow
escaped from this hole.

225
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,694
So deep inside…

226
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:25,197
Yes. No doubt about it.
It's connected to the Demon Realm.

227
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,783
How long are you
going to stick your nose in?

228
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,410
This is our problem!

229
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,830
You abandoned the power of
the Demon King so easily!

230
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:35,332
You have no right to fight
for the Demon Realm!

231
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,709
Open your eyes!

232
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,171
What if I fight for you?

233
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:46,927
Don't joke around!
This is a problem for me to solve!

234
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,679
Got it.

235
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,973
We'll just need to settle
this with our fists.

236
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:51,891
What?

237
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,312
He who wins decides what happens.

238
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:57,855
I accept.

239
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,773
You can't, Meliodas!

240
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,358
This isn't the place to fight!

241
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:11,368
It's decided! All four of us will go!

242
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,371
You won fair and square.

243
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,539
It cannot be helped.

244
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,125
There, there. You always act so tough.

245
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,420
Now that that's decided,
let's get a move on!

246
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:31,388
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today
for the wedding ceremony

247
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,682
of the Fairy King Harlequin

248
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,685
and the Princess of the Giant Clan, Diane.

249
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,813
Despite being of different clans,

250
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:42,900
they were drawn together by a strong love.

251
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,944
I pray their love is eternal,

252
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:48,113
and that this union forges a stronger bond

253
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,074
between the Fairy Clan

254
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,785
and the Giant Clan.

255
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,997
{\an8}-You may now kiss the bride.
-What?

256
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,458
Kiss?

257
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,377
In front of so many people?

258
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,836
How embarrassing!

259
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,799
Well, this is a common custom.

260
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,134
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

261
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,886
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

262
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,304
Give the crowd what it wants.

263
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:16,225
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

264
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,269
Congratulations, King!

265
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,063
Congratulations, Diane!

266
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,899
King. Diane.

267
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,026
I hope you're both happy.

268
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,488
Aren't you interested
in having something like this?

269
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,573
-Not at all!
-Me neither!

270
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,953
This is delicious.

271
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,204
This is a new era.

272
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,500
This day actually came.

273
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,502
You didn't think it would?

274
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,546
No. I knew it would.

275
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,257
But I'm just glad that it's here.

276
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,219
But I wish everyone else could have come.

277
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:55,723
{\an8}Captain. Elizabeth. Merlin.

278
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,852
<i>And Escanor.</i>

279
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,482
Also, Hawk!

280
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:08,986
Right. Did that pig return
to the Demon Realm?

281
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:13,073
I wonder if he is doing well right now?

282
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:24,418
{\an8}<i>Got you! Rolling Ham Attack!</i>

283
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:31,759
You're really used to
life here in Purgatory, Mild.

284
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,343
You really are my little brother.

285
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,928
Of course!

286
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,638
I was known all over

287
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:40,309
as Captain Leftovers Hawk!

288
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,562
Let's go hunt the master of the valley!

289
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,689
We brothers can do anything!

290
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:50,819
{\an8}Hey, Wild.
The food in Purgatory isn't bad.

291
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,655
{\an8}But I really miss leftovers.

292
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:57,951
Leftovers? Are these not leftovers?

293
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,370
You don't know anything, Wild!

294
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,414
That is just half-eaten.

295
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,458
True leftovers

296
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:08,337
<i>are the ultimate treat formed</i>

297
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,924
<i>by the fermentation of all sorts
of half-finished foods.</i>

298
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:16,386
{\an8}It is the epitome of gourmet.

299
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,180
It's decided.

300
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:21,016
Let's go feast on leftovers, Mild!

301
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:21,934
What?

302
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:26,647
Oh, to the human world!

303
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,732
Wait for me, Wild!

304
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:36,073
Everyone returns to the place they belong.

305
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,118
As the third in my line,

306
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:42,204
I plan on succeeding
the will of the first Fairy King.

307
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:47,918
That reminds me. I've never
heard about the second king.

308
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,045
What was he like?

309
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,756
Oh, do you mean Dahlia?

310
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,301
Actually, I don't know much either.

311
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,637
After all, I was born

312
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,306
after Dahlia disappeared from the forest.

313
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:02,933
I don't mind.

314
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,394
What?

315
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,480
An earthquake?

316
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,782
Tomorrow is the actual festival,

317
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,325
but everyone is so lively today.

318
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,538
Isn't that fine?

319
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:27,708
It's better for celebrations
to last as long as possible.

320
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,042
That's true.

321
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:32,421
-But we don't get a break.
-Catch me if you can!

322
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:34,339
Sorry!

323
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,633
Hey! Kids!

324
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,760
Don't cause trouble, you hear?

325
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,179
Yes!

326
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,931
Wait for me!

327
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:46,768
Hey. Don't just stop all of a sudden.

328
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,353
What is that sound?

329
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:49,938
Sound?

330
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:55,819
What is that?

331
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:09,583
The Giant and Fairy Clans
are on the attack!

332
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,257
Brother!

333
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:24,514
The children!

334
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,017
Dammit! I can't make it!

335
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:41,949
Jericho!

336
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,200
Found you!

337
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,535
Holy Knight!

338
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:54,920
We must punish the Seven Deadly Sins

339
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:58,215
and those that joined them
in ruining the Holy War.

340
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,982
Are you okay, Guila?

341
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,109
I'm fine. Save the others.

342
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,194
No.

343
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,029
I think they'll be okay.

344
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,155
What?

345
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,950
They are after us, the Holy Knights.

346
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,536
They aren't looking at
any of the other city folk.

347
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,373
Why would the Giants
and Fairies attack all of a sudden?

348
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,291
Don't ask me.

349
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,835
The Seven Deadly Sins, who ruined…

350
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:37,796
However, there is something
off about their appearance.

351
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,798
I felt it too.

352
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,175
It feels like someone is controlling them.

353
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:45,762
If that's the case,

354
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,306
we'll need to hold back.

355
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:53,186
Their accomplices shall be punished.

356
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:58,275
We wouldn't be able to stop them
even if we didn't hold back!

357
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:00,360
{\an8}KINGDOM OF CAMELOT

358
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,278
{\an8}Arthur.

359
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:03,864
Don't push yourself too far.

360
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:07,284
I won't. This is the last one.

361
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,300
Forgive me.

362
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:29,473
I couldn't live up to your expectations.

363
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,143
Arthur.

364
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:42,986
We must punish the Seven Deadly Sins…

365
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,906
and those that joined them
in ruining the Holy War.

366
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:54,831
Hurry up!

367
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,501
Be careful, Elizabeth!

368
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:58,418
Okay!

369
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,924
Let's rest for a moment.

370
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:06,927
Gelda. The Demon Realm
is in danger if we don't hurry.

371
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:10,430
Just a minute. I am parched.

372
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:13,016
Sorry. I didn't notice.

373
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:16,812
First, you need some nutrition.

374
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,688
You didn't get a chance to eat, right?

375
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,482
Right.

376
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,400
All right! Leave it to me!

377
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:26,905
Believe it or not, I ran a pub.

378
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:28,949
Cooking is my specialty!

379
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,952
Hand it over. I'll cook it myself.

380
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:34,746
This is an apology for
eating your fish before.

381
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,374
-Hand it over!
-You're so stubborn.

382
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:39,000
{\an8}-Prepare for battle!
-Prepare for battle!

383
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,713
Dammit!

384
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:47,467
People have their habits, I guess.

385
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,386
He is quite stubborn.

386
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:56,184
How did cooking a fish
make it taste like this?

387
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,727
Make sure to eat it all!

388
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:59,271
Eat!

389
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,401
Meliodas! What are you doing?

390
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,154
Apologies, Gelda.

391
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:10,115
It would be terrible
if you drink my blood now.

392
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:11,825
It's fine.

393
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:14,619
I just wanted you to rest.

394
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:18,248
Listen, Meliodas!

395
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:21,001
I shall never take another bite
of your cooking!

396
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:25,046
It's your fault for always playing rock.

397
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,506
What do you mean?

398
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,176
I'm sort of glad.

399
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,135
Glad?

400
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:31,678
Yes.

401
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:35,390
I'm glad we can be together
and talk like this.

402
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:36,975
That's true.

403
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:39,144
It is kind of incredible.

404
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:46,151
The entrance is coming up! Elizabeth!

405
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:48,111
Protect against the Demon Realm's miasma!

406
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,279
Okay!

407
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:51,990
Saint Coat!

408
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:55,452
Don't get lost
during the shock of entering!

409
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,882
The miasma is weakened.

410
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,092
What happened?

411
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:18,767
This light. I don't like that one bit.

412
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,644
Gelda. Are you okay?

413
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,482
This is serious.

414
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:33,615
Welcome to our new base.

415
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,576
Meliodas the Destroyer.

416
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,955
And some uninvited guests.

417
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:43,541
It can't be! You are…

418
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,002
the second Fairy King,

419
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:47,796
Dahlia,

420
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,383
{\an8}and the master craftsman
of the Giants, Dubs.

421
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,304
You two attacked the Demon Realm alone?

422
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,640
At least I can praise your courage!

423
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,185
It's not just the two of us.

424
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:05,105
{\an8}We sent our large group
of allies to the other side.

425
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:07,524
-What?
-What did you say?

426
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:09,609
What is your goal?

427
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,821
That's simple.

428
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:16,324
You squandered our game!

429
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:19,577
{\an8}SPIRIT SPEAR DARRENHEART
FORM ONE "SPIRIT SPEAR"

430
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:23,832
You will pay for that!

431
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:25,500
Watch out!

432
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:31,589
All of your accomplices will also perish!

433
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:35,760
You are the ones

434
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,013
who will pay for your deeds!

435
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:46,396
Zel!

436
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:52,402
Your fate is already decided.

437
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:54,487
Stop this.

438
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:58,742
Dubs. I know you aren't a fighter.

439
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,119
I refuse.

440
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,623
Sacred Treasure Lostvayne.

441
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,250
Sacred Treasure, release!

442
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:10,003
PHYSICAL CLONE

443
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:13,631
Form Five "Increase."

444
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:25,018
Form Four "Sunflower."

445
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:33,818
Seriously?

446
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,863
Second Fairy King.

447
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:39,783
I am sure you are quite powerful,

448
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:44,037
{\an8}but you are nothing
compared to the current Fairy King.

449
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,419
My eyes! What is this dust?

450
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,296
ASH DUST BURIAL

451
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:56,800
It seems you picked a fight
with the wrong people!

452
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:00,095
Perish!

453
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:04,140
Combo Move!
Sphere Destruction Spear Thrust!

454
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,397
Really?

455
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,525
Is the current Fairy King's magic
so powerful?

456
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:18,279
I've never been a big fan of magic.

457
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:20,907
Zel!

458
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:26,996
I myself prefer to fight with my fists!

459
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,123
SPIRIT SPEAR DARRENHEART
FORM SEVEN "YGGDRA ARMOR"

460
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,338
Be careful, Meliodas!
I feel some strange power.

461
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,925
I'll finish this here!

462
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:53,106
Why are his copies attacking him?

463
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,942
What is this?

464
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:00,530
I am the one who made Lostvayne.

465
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:03,658
My work is like a child to me.

466
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:09,080
Well then. Let's end this.

467
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,416
Shall we?

468
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:17,046
Killer Fairy!

469
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:18,798
Gelda!

470
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,602
Staff of Imprisonment.

471
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:44,824
{\an8}-Meliodas!
-Elizabeth!

472
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,127
Is everything cleaned up there too?

473
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,045
Yes.

474
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:02,133
The Demon King's sons
didn't give us much of a fight.

475
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,844
All that's left is the other side.

476
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,888
We don't need to worry about that.

477
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:10,642
Our allies will drop
the hammer of punishment.

478
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,897
Stop it!

479
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:19,150
Stop this! We are allies!

480
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:22,904
Did we do something bad?

481
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,240
Run as fast as you can!

482
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,284
Holy Knights! Are you okay?

483
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,536
What is happening?

484
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,871
They won't even listen to us!

485
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:34,582
I don't know the cause either.

486
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,376
All I know is that

487
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:40,338
they weren't a part of the last Holy War.

488
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:49,305
Hold on to me! Thunder Emperor Flash!

489
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,563
Gil! In front of you!

490
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,023
{\an8}Rising Tornado!

491
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:07,782
-We made it out.
-Yeah.

492
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:10,785
That was a close one.

493
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,329
What on earth is happening?

494
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:17,250
Why are they attacking us
and people from their own clan?

495
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:18,751
I can't imagine why.

496
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:24,883
-What is it, Gil?
-That direction…

497
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:27,135
-Liones!
-Liones!

498
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,971
The Seven Deadly Sins,

499
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:34,642
who ruined the Holy War, and those
that joined them will be punished.

500
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,061
What is happening?

501
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:42,734
Fairies and Giants fought on our side
in the Holy War! We should be allies!

502
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:46,696
However, I don't recognize
any of them from the war.

503
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:50,325
So they are the ones
who weren't in the war?

504
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:53,661
I'm more concerned by that phrase

505
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:54,829
they keep muttering nonstop.

506
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:58,166
We must punish the Seven Deadly Sins

507
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:01,586
and those that joined them
in ruining the Holy War.

508
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,213
They don't say

509
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:07,216
we fought the Holy War together.
They say we ruined it.

510
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,343
{\an8}What does that mean?

511
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:12,639
It won't hold any longer! It'll break!

512
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,646
The King's life could be in danger!

513
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,774
-Margaret.
-Veronica.

514
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:24,400
We need to hurry to Liones.

515
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:28,404
We'll be surrounded if we climb down!

516
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,406
Is there any other way?

517
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,201
-Calm down, both of you!
-I don't know!

518
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,786
There are Holy Knights in the city!

519
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,080
They aren't enough against this enemy.

520
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:39,666
-Look down.
-What should we do, then?

521
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:40,708
Look down!

522
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,126
-We're in the middle of something!
-We're in the middle of something!

523
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,044
-What?
-What?

524
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,548
{\an8}Wall!

525
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,427
-No way!
-No way!

526
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,346
-Get out of the way!
-Escape!

527
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:02,605
{\an8}Thank goodness! We're in Liones!

528
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:03,856
{\an8}No way.

529
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,650
{\an8}That was a direct hit. Is he okay?

530
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:09,362
This is bad! He's waking up!

531
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,074
Grab their weapons!

532
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,120
These weapons.

533
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,455
What is this feeling?

534
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:22,417
It feels like it is draining my power.

535
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,419
Don't go overboard.

536
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:29,340
Fine. Thunder Emperor Hammer!

537
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:32,385
Rising Tornado!

538
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:46,357
I told you not to go overboard.

539
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,526
Oh, I didn't mean to.

540
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:50,820
These weapons are amazing.

541
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:56,075
King Harlequin! Escape!

542
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,535
Diane. Retreat.

543
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,122
It appears they are under the influence

544
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,749
of powerful hypnosis.

545
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:06,919
And I have an idea about
the nature of this magic.

546
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,880
If that's it,
there's only one way to stop it.

547
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:12,216
King. Don't be too hard on them.

548
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,718
Okay.

549
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,141
POLLEN GARDEN

550
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,518
This is our forest!

551
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:26,731
On top of that, today is the precious
wedding day of Diane and me.

552
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,734
I will not allow rudeness.

553
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:35,073
Double Bow Harlit.

554
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,451
Ability. Range Enhancement.

555
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,161
Jack.

556
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:48,252
JACK

557
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,134
SEED OF AWAKENING

558
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,354
All of a sudden…

559
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:10,817
What are we doing?

560
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,528
They should be normal again.

561
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,240
No! Not yet!

562
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:21,744
We must punish the Seven Deadly Sins…

563
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:25,456
and those that joined them
in ruining the Holy War.

564
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:28,292
They weren't awakened.

565
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:29,335
It's not that.

566
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,004
Something they are wearing

567
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,965
is blocking its effects.

568
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:36,676
That makes things simple.

569
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:43,266
Snatch!

570
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,192
What are we doing?

571
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:57,488
This isn't our forest!

572
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,282
My head hurts.

573
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:00,700
Why did this happen?

574
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:03,202
Someone was controlling you.

575
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,453
You attacked this forest.

576
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,371
-What?
-What?

577
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:08,040
What happened to you?

578
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:13,171
A Fairy and a Giant appeared before us.

579
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,507
It was the Fairy King Dahlia, wasn't it?

580
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:19,343
The hypnosis cast on you

581
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,845
is a power of the Fairy King.

582
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:24,765
Then the other must be
the mast craftsman Dubs.

583
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,017
How did you know?

584
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,145
No one can mistake his work.

585
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,774
It was very sudden.

586
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:38,446
The Fairy King Dahlia took
control of our minds.

587
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,658
We grabbed the weapons
of the master craftsman Dubs.

588
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:50,583
We were driven by anger against
the Seven Deadly Sins

589
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:52,919
to do awful things. I'm so sorry!

590
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:55,671
It isn't your fault!

591
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:58,090
If that is what happened,

592
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,134
the others are in danger too.

593
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,677
It can't be helped.

594
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:05,556
Let's postpone the wedding reception.

595
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,628
Griamore!

596
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:01,487
What happens if you fail?

597
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,198
The Seven Deadly Sins.

598
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:08,160
Even though one is gone,
they are god-killers who even

599
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:10,121
defeated the Demon King.

600
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:12,915
I didn't really think of that.

601
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:17,670
I don't know much
about the Seven Deadly Sins.

602
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:21,632
I guess anything can happen.

603
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,303
-Enjoy.
-Thank you!

604
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:38,065
Drank it all down? You're finished!

605
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:41,777
How does Indura excretion
flavored wine taste?

606
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,779
It's a powerful poison

607
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:46,949
that can kill even
a Demon with a few drops!

608
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:49,327
It's tasty!

609
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,580
-Impossible.
-You fool.

610
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:57,585
Did you really think
that trick would work?

611
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,838
You're fired.

612
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:09,305
If we fail, we fail.

613
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:14,268
We have another powerful ally.

614
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:19,273
{\an8}CELESTIAL REALM

615
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:26,530
There.

616
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:30,993
Brothers. Tarmiel. Sariel.

617
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,788
Until you are revived once again,

618
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:37,291
I shall protect the Celestial Realm.

619
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:50,388
Lord Mael.

620
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:55,768
Everyone. It's been 3,000 years.

621
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:57,311
You really…

622
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:00,147
You really are alive!

623
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:03,734
The Holy War is finished.

624
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,862
We don't need to hate the Demon Clan.

625
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,993
Don't do that! Please lift your heads.

626
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,453
Mael.

627
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,997
Please guide us.

628
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:21,085
In order to achieve your new mission.

629
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,379
New mission?

630
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:28,175
{\an8}Thank goodness. You're awake.

631
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,138
Gelda.

632
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,182
I'm sorry, Zeldris.

633
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,894
<i>In order to save you from the rubble,</i>

634
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,147
<i>I had to take a lot of blood.</i>

635
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,608
I'm so ashamed.

636
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:49,530
I have no right to claim
the throne of the Demon Realm.

637
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,490
Don't show them

638
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:54,118
that sort of weakness.

639
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:57,371
Welcome back, King Zeldris.

640
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:00,749
They protected us.

641
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:02,710
I see.

642
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:05,504
I can't figure this out.

643
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:09,967
No matter how powerful
Dahlia and Dubs are,

644
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:13,137
they shouldn't be able
to clear the miasma.

645
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,848
But they have.

646
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:20,102
I feel some strange power from them.

647
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,607
Lord Zeldris!

648
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:29,278
Did Meliodas really destroy
the Demon King?

649
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,198
Yes.

650
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:37,369
I helped him do it.

651
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,371
What do you mean?

652
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,957
Why would you do that, Lord Zeldris?

653
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:46,253
I am sure you have a lot to say.

654
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:49,256
First, let's solve the problem
that lies before us.

655
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,551
We need to save Meliodas and Elizabeth.

656
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,762
Who will lend me a hand?

657
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,348
The traitor Meliodas?

658
00:41:57,431 --> 00:42:00,017
Bloody Ellie is in the Demon Realm?

659
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:04,730
We will need their strength
to defeat Dahlia and Dubs.

660
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,399
I can't believe this.

661
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:10,694
I can't trust you anymore!

662
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:14,615
What was your goal for returning here?

663
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:20,704
I returned to become your king

664
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:24,458
and create a peaceful Demon Realm
without pointless fighting.

665
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,672
<i>My father only saw this place
as part of his game.</i>

666
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:34,260
To him, you were all just

667
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:36,011
breathing pawns.

668
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:40,933
And he finally tried
to make me his new vessel.

669
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:48,274
Meliodas and Elizabeth saved me from that.

670
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,820
That is all I have to say.
It's your decision.

671
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:56,365
Are you okay?

672
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:00,869
I'm sure Bartra
is complaining about me now.

673
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:02,746
Probably.

674
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:06,250
Anyway, what's wrong with this place?

675
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:10,796
There are not even walls for me
to break down.

676
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:15,009
I wonder if Zeldris and Gelda are okay.

677
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:18,721
Dahlia and Dubs really got us good.

678
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,765
About that.

679
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:27,021
I remember that Dahlia
had no interest in the Holy War.

680
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:30,482
<i>He disappeared without getting
involved with Stigma.</i>

681
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:35,237
<i>Dubs also created
the Coffin of Eternal Darkness</i>

682
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:37,281
<i>to end the Holy War.</i>

683
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:43,287
But suddenly, they come out
and say we ruined the Holy War?

684
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,206
That really is strange.

685
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,458
Also,

686
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:50,294
I don't remember them being so powerful.

687
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:51,962
I wonder what happened?

688
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,632
In order to find that answer,

689
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,885
we'll need to get out of here first.

690
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,638
Thousand God Slayer!

691
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:13,692
Well… What to do now?

692
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:16,820
I'm sure they'll come to save us soon.

693
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:18,447
I doubt that.

694
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:22,493
Ban and the others don't
know we're in the Demon Realm.

695
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,995
I meant Zeldris!

696
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:30,167
I don't know about that. I'm his
traitorous and oathbreaking brother.

697
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:35,422
I followed him into the Demon Realm
even though he didn't like it.

698
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:40,010
Now, now. You want Zeldris
to believe in you, right?

699
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:43,180
You need to believe in him too.

700
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:47,976
Families believe in each
other no matter what.

701
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:53,107
My father and sisters taught me that.

702
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:58,237
Let's go save everyone in
Britannia once we get out of here.

703
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:01,740
Once that's done, we can return to Liones.

704
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:04,576
Together, right?

705
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:08,580
Right. We have a lot to do.

706
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:15,754
{\an8}Meliodas! Are you okay?

707
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,550
Hey, Zeldris!

708
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:20,968
Oh, my.

709
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:23,846
You came to save me.

710
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:27,724
Good grief. You guys
don't have the ability to feel nervous.

711
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,608
{\an8}Don't act so shameful in front of others.

712
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,986
Thanks, Zeldris.

713
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:41,280
I'm glad you came.

714
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:45,993
Unbelievable. How are you my brother?

715
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,786
See? I was right.

716
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:57,421
My Sacred Treasure couldn't break this.

717
00:45:57,504 --> 00:45:59,047
How did you do it?

718
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:00,799
You're so slow.

719
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:04,428
Weapons made by Dubs like your sword

720
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:08,140
are nullified by his magic.

721
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:09,725
I see!

722
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:13,604
I'm impressed you were able to make it
this far without being detected.

723
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:16,982
It wasn't just me.

724
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:21,737
You can't do whatever you want
to the Demon Realm!

725
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:25,782
It looks like we did.

726
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:28,702
Where were you little gnats hiding?

727
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:33,790
Were you ordered by Zeldris and Meliodas?

728
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:35,959
SPIRIT SPEAR DARRENHEART
FORM FIVE "INCREASE"

729
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:46,678
We two are now the kings
of the Demon Realm.

730
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:48,347
Bow before us!

731
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:50,724
You don't get it.

732
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:52,809
Don't you realize this is pointless?

733
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:57,689
Where did that shield come from?

734
00:46:58,273 --> 00:46:59,983
Flying Saucer.

735
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:02,945
It protects the holder.
I'm quite proud of it.

736
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:06,532
Your crude weapons will
not leave a scratch on it.

737
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,328
What was that?

738
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:13,580
Death Scythe.

739
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:17,251
After slicing the enemy to pieces,

740
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:19,836
this work of art chops off their heads.

741
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,172
You two are kings?

742
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:24,007
Nonsense!

743
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:26,260
We only have one king!

744
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,471
The Demon King is no more!

745
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:30,389
You bunch…

746
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:34,059
follow behind him!

747
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:38,355
It's time to end this!

748
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:53,912
You are… Meliodas!

749
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:57,833
Lord Zeldris!

750
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:02,588
I was able to save Meliodas thanks to you.

751
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:03,547
You have my appreciation.

752
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:07,175
We just trusted our new king.

753
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:08,468
That is all.

754
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:12,139
Why?

755
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,600
Why would a traitor like you

756
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:16,727
fight for the Demon Realm?

757
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:20,397
The Holy War is over.

758
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,233
There is no need to spill more blood.

759
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:28,030
Lord Meliodas…

760
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:30,532
Well, then.

761
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,796
You two never learn!

762
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,799
Your Sacred Treasures
are meaningless against me.

763
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:08,111
Good reaction.

764
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,366
Where did that shield come from?

765
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:14,868
{\an8}There's more where that came from.

766
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:24,419
Cut him to pieces!

767
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:25,671
Death Scythe!

768
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:35,347
What?

769
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:40,185
Impressive.

770
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:43,355
You were the same sort of fighter as me.

771
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:47,734
Perfect. Let's see who is stronger…

772
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,153
once and for all!

773
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:54,074
There's no doubt about it! I'm stronger!

774
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:58,787
They can't keep this up.

775
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:02,290
My wounds.

776
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:04,209
What's happening?

777
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:07,045
Don't worry about them.

778
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:11,883
You are Bloody Ellie!

779
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:15,011
I wish you wouldn't call me that anymore.

780
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:18,515
Didn't Zeldris tell you?

781
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:19,850
She is an ally.

782
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:20,767
Gelda.

783
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:24,479
Who are you worried about?

784
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:27,149
Do you really think your new king

785
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:30,152
and the brother
he respects would really lose?

786
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:36,658
How could he… That was my finest work.

787
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:40,412
Who forged that sword?

788
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:43,874
These swords come a dime a dozen.

789
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:45,000
{\an8}Impossible!

790
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:48,628
{\an8}Some common sword cannot destroy my art!

791
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:53,049
You are top-level as a craftsman,

792
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:55,135
but you are a pitiful warrior.

793
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:58,263
A great warrior can turn a common
sword into a masterpiece.

794
00:50:58,346 --> 00:51:01,141
A novice can turn a masterpiece
into a common weapon.

795
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:03,018
Remember that!

796
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,731
Ominous Nebula!

797
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,322
Flying Saucer!

798
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:22,287
Those who cannot protect
themselves without tools…

799
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:25,123
don't belong…

800
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:27,626
on the battlefield!

801
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:33,757
{\an8}Get over here!

802
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:37,052
It's over!

803
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:41,807
Killer Fairy!

804
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:48,563
My attack…

805
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:50,148
I see.

806
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:52,192
I guess it's my turn.

807
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:38,446
Apologies, Dahlia.

808
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,950
I'm sure you're a good fighter.

809
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:46,580
But I have fought some
real monsters in my day.

810
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:50,375
Hey, Meliodas.

811
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:54,296
He can't hear you.

812
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:58,967
Oh, my. Did I go overboard?

813
00:53:06,182 --> 00:53:08,226
-Meliodas.
-Yes.

814
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:15,567
What was that?

815
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:18,486
Cheat Hope?

816
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,324
You truly have my thanks.

817
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:25,535
If you hadn't arrived,

818
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:27,662
my Kingdom would be in shambles now.

819
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:31,917
I'm sorry. It ruined your wedding.

820
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,543
It's fine. Don't worry about that!

821
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:36,963
We couldn't really
celebrate like that, anyway.

822
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:40,717
However, the main issue remains.

823
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,011
What do you mean, King?

824
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:45,680
If you have something to say, say it.

825
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:47,682
I think that Dahlia and Dubs

826
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:50,185
were controlling all of the others.

827
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:51,937
But if someone else

828
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:55,231
was controlling them…

829
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,359
There is a mastermind

830
00:53:57,442 --> 00:54:01,237
who was controlling the second fairy
king and the master craftsman.

831
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:04,199
Who could do that?

832
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:06,242
I don't know.

833
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:08,453
However, to be honest,

834
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:13,208
I don't think those two started this.

835
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:17,504
Aren't you overthinking this?

836
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:20,465
-Right, Gil?
-Yes.

837
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:32,143
It seems like his intuition
wasn't off this time.

838
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:38,024
I need to let the others know.

839
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:40,944
The world is facing a grave threat.

840
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:01,589
Long time no see, Mael.

841
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,222
It seems they got you good.

842
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:11,725
Are you okay?

843
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:13,852
Thank you.

844
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:19,149
But this is a problem
for our Goddess Clan…

845
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:24,029
No, this problem affects all clans now.

846
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:56,102
Tell me. Did that really control
Dahlia and Dubs?

847
00:55:57,479 --> 00:56:00,648
She might have grown senile
after a 3,000 year-long sleep.

848
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:03,902
I guess she can't tell
the enemy from an ally.

849
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:05,653
Please!

850
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:08,656
Reconsider your thoughts!

851
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,283
Supreme Deity!

852
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:15,830
This is our first encounter,

853
00:56:16,372 --> 00:56:17,999
Seven Deadly Sins.

854
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:23,171
<i>While sealed away in sleep,</i>

855
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:27,258
<i>I watched everything through
my daughter Elizabeth.</i>

856
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:32,055
I expected nothing less from those
who put an end to the Demon King.

857
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:35,391
It seems like ordinary soldiers
were no match for you.

858
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:39,687
The one who controlled Dahlia and Dubs

859
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:40,897
was you, wasn't it?

860
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:43,650
Why are you after us?

861
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:47,487
They sacrificed much to
destroy the Demon King

862
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,447
and end the Holy War.

863
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:51,866
What crime is that?

864
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:56,371
Fools. It should not have ended.

865
00:56:57,413 --> 00:57:00,333
You never should have ended the Holy War!

866
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:02,460
What do you mean?

867
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:04,295
Enough.

868
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:06,339
I've had enough talk.

869
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:09,843
If you want to fight, we'll give you one.

870
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:13,221
Very well.

871
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:17,976
You cannot understand
the nature of this world anyway.

872
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:21,855
Listen, my creations!

873
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:25,608
All those on the side
of the Seven Deadly Sins

874
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:27,110
are to be destroyed.

875
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:32,532
Grand Holy Knight Howzer!

876
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:34,284
Whose side are we on?

877
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:37,454
Fools! Follow your hearts! It's obvious!

878
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:39,330
Someone who calls herself a god

879
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:40,790
and looks down upon everything?

880
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:44,335
Or those who shed blood and tears

881
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:46,754
many times to protect us!

882
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:50,216
There is one answer!

883
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:06,858
Please! They are being controlled
by the Supreme Deity!

884
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:08,109
Don't kill them!

885
00:58:08,693 --> 00:58:10,278
Ice Anker!

886
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:16,201
Bomb Shock!

887
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:22,499
Everyone! Avoid their vitals!

888
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:29,214
Watch out!

889
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:32,759
I'm sorry.

890
00:58:35,136 --> 00:58:36,846
For my own selfish desires.

891
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:40,517
No. It isn't selfish.

892
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:42,810
They are your precious allies.

893
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:45,313
Thank you.

894
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:47,315
Let's go, Gil!

895
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:50,151
You got it, Howzer!

896
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:52,946
Crazy Wind!

897
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,200
Thunder Emperor Hammer!

898
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:01,955
-Combo Move! Spider Net Crash!
-Combo Move! Spider Net Crash!

899
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:07,168
Everyone! Open your eyes!

900
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:09,504
No matter what…

901
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:13,007
I won't let you in!

902
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,677
Don't underestimate me!

903
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:19,430
We are soldiers who survived the Holy War!

904
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:23,643
Fools.

905
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:29,566
{\an8}-What?
-What?

906
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:30,984
God Thunder.

907
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:53,214
I see.

908
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:56,467
You can withstand my attack.

909
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:59,053
Such power!

910
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:01,889
Even Gideon's Lightning Rod
couldn't absorb everything.

911
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:04,767
She even hit her own allies.

912
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:08,813
If she strikes again,
neither we nor the others

913
01:00:08,896 --> 01:00:10,440
can survive.

914
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:14,193
One more strike then.

915
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:17,530
Don't underestimate us!

916
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:21,701
ASSAULT HUNT

917
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:30,627
That's right! We destroyed the Demon King!

918
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:32,837
How bothersome.

919
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:35,423
Stop right there!

920
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:47,393
Breaker Off!

921
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:53,983
What do you think I am?

922
01:00:54,942 --> 01:00:56,569
I can only hold it for a second.

923
01:00:56,653 --> 01:01:01,199
That's plenty of time! Rush Rock!

924
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,038
Hit her at the same time!

925
01:01:07,121 --> 01:01:08,373
-You got it.
-Yeah!

926
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:14,420
-No way.
-Our attacks didn't work.

927
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:15,755
I see.

928
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:19,217
Just like magic attacks
didn't work on the Demon King,

929
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:22,679
physical attacks don't work
against the Supreme Deity.

930
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:28,184
It's no use. You're no match
for the Supreme Deity.

931
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:31,896
Then let's defeat her with magic!

932
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:36,025
True Spirit Spear Chastiefol!
Form Four!

933
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:38,069
Sunflower!

934
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:48,663
DIVINE POWER OF TEN WINGS

935
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:52,166
Not a bad attack.

936
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:55,128
Unfortunately,
the pure magic of the Sacred Tree

937
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:57,672
is far too close to my own magic.

938
01:02:00,341 --> 01:02:01,843
God Thunder.

939
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:20,069
Dammit. First the Captain's old man.

940
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:22,071
Now the Princess' mom.

941
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:24,991
Who do you think you are?

942
01:02:25,658 --> 01:02:28,077
You withstood my God Thunder.

943
01:02:28,786 --> 01:02:32,165
Only a survivor of Purgatory
could do that.

944
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:41,966
What do you think?

945
01:02:42,049 --> 01:02:44,886
A little taste of your own God Thunder!

946
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:48,723
I am the power of light.

947
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:52,185
The best you can do is leave a scratch.

948
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:55,688
Then let's see who lasts longer!

949
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,524
This is futile.

950
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:01,986
And yet, it seems like it's
pissing you off good!

951
01:03:03,571 --> 01:03:04,906
You make me laugh.

952
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:08,075
Do you think you can win?

953
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,915
We might have next to no chance.

954
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:17,960
{\an8}But we can't give up!

955
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:20,963
For our friend who fought with us

956
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:24,050
{\an8}and died in order to protect us!

957
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:26,052
{\an8}For Escanor!

958
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:28,971
We have won the present and future

959
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:31,557
together with our allies!

960
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:34,894
We won't let it be stolen for no reason!

961
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:37,605
Get out of here.

962
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:40,483
You don't belong here!

963
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:56,999
We'll be finished if that hits us!

964
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:03,214
This is your fault, Ban!
You made her really mad!

965
01:04:03,297 --> 01:04:05,591
Why me? It was King!

966
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:06,968
Leave me out of this.

967
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:10,096
I'll eliminate you all.

968
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:22,608
Full Counter!

969
01:04:25,611 --> 01:04:28,364
{\an8}FULL COUNTER

970
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:38,875
You…

971
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:42,420
It seems you got really irritated.

972
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:47,300
You finally arrived.

973
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:49,760
{\an8}Took you long enough.

974
01:04:50,344 --> 01:04:51,804
Hey, Gil!

975
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:54,223
Yes. I knew he would come!

976
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:56,183
-Meliodas!
-Meliodas!

977
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:00,271
It's okay now.

978
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:02,481
Lady Elizabeth.

979
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:06,903
Buddy. Had a fun honeymoon?

980
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:10,656
I guess, but it would have been nicer
to have a bit more time.

981
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:13,576
Captain!

982
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:15,912
Why did you go on a honeymoon

983
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:18,039
during our wedding?

984
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:21,834
Didn't you say your wedding
was next month?

985
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:24,503
What? Was that right?

986
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:28,841
I've never been good with dates.

987
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:32,219
Accursed child, Meliodas.

988
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:36,015
You are the source of all evil.

989
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:38,893
You lured my daughter Elizabeth

990
01:05:38,976 --> 01:05:42,271
and ruined the Holy War.

991
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:44,649
Is that all you can say?

992
01:05:45,232 --> 01:05:47,610
You can't say
anything else to say, can you?

993
01:05:49,028 --> 01:05:50,905
Vanish from my sight!

994
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:57,078
OMINOUS BIND

995
01:05:57,828 --> 01:05:59,330
Where did that come from?

996
01:06:00,414 --> 01:06:03,626
That? That isn't my doing.

997
01:06:04,877 --> 01:06:06,587
Hurry up and finish her, Meliodas!

998
01:06:07,546 --> 01:06:08,673
Zeldris!

999
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:15,554
Thousand God Slayer!

1000
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:19,517
Combo Move!

1001
01:06:20,351 --> 01:06:22,436
Dark Execution!

1002
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:26,941
Meliodas!

1003
01:06:27,608 --> 01:06:30,236
Aren't you satisfied
by killing your father?

1004
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:33,531
Must you also attempt to murder
your lover's mother?

1005
01:06:39,036 --> 01:06:40,705
This must be painful for you.

1006
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:44,291
Your real mother is the Supreme Deity.

1007
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:45,209
No.

1008
01:06:46,627 --> 01:06:49,171
You are my only real parent.

1009
01:06:49,714 --> 01:06:51,632
You loved me no matter what I am.

1010
01:06:51,716 --> 01:06:54,969
I love you for that, father.

1011
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:57,847
Elizabeth.

1012
01:07:04,311 --> 01:07:08,607
Please leave this world.

1013
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:10,359
Elizabeth.

1014
01:07:11,068 --> 01:07:13,446
That is no way to speak to your mother.

1015
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:14,905
You may have

1016
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:16,866
given birth to me,

1017
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:20,077
but there was no emotion in that.

1018
01:07:20,828 --> 01:07:22,621
If you loved me,

1019
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:26,876
you wouldn't cast a cruel spell
like Eternal Reincarnation on me.

1020
01:07:27,793 --> 01:07:30,588
Thanks to Meliodas
and many of my companions,

1021
01:07:30,671 --> 01:07:33,090
I was able to break that wheel of fate.

1022
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:35,760
Now that the curse is lifted,

1023
01:07:35,843 --> 01:07:38,971
I am released from the burden
of being your daughter.

1024
01:07:40,347 --> 01:07:43,267
Please stop causing more strife.

1025
01:07:43,934 --> 01:07:46,437
If you continue to hurt

1026
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:49,023
my family and treasured friends

1027
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:51,650
I will fight you.

1028
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:55,863
You don't understand anything.

1029
01:07:56,614 --> 01:07:59,533
The Demon and Goddess Clan

1030
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:03,287
are bound to an eternal conflict.

1031
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:05,790
Continuing the Holy War

1032
01:08:05,873 --> 01:08:09,043
is the only way to maintain the balance
of this world.

1033
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:13,798
Continue the Holy War to maintain balance?

1034
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:15,549
Why is that necessary?

1035
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:18,803
There's no reason.

1036
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:23,182
When I was possessed by the Demon King,

1037
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:26,185
I could see all of his thoughts.

1038
01:08:27,144 --> 01:08:30,856
The Demon King and Supreme
deity were born with a mission

1039
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:33,609
to continue with an eternal conflict.

1040
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:36,904
To them, the Holy War

1041
01:08:36,987 --> 01:08:38,989
is just a game.

1042
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:42,743
Unforgivable.

1043
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:47,498
An inferior creation has no right
to speak of a god's intentions!

1044
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:51,710
Elizabeth!

1045
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:01,345
Gelda. Thank you.

1046
01:09:01,428 --> 01:09:03,931
This makes us even
for the Demon King battle.

1047
01:09:04,598 --> 01:09:09,270
I shall destroy you
and start the Holy War anew!

1048
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:23,075
Fool. If you had gained that power
surpassing the Demon King

1049
01:09:23,701 --> 01:09:25,911
you would have been able to defeat me!

1050
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:28,372
I agree with you there.

1051
01:09:28,455 --> 01:09:30,833
If you hadn't given up that power,

1052
01:09:30,916 --> 01:09:34,086
we wouldn't have struggled like this!

1053
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:42,511
But thanks to that,

1054
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:45,347
we can fight together

1055
01:09:45,931 --> 01:09:49,185
side by side like this!

1056
01:09:50,644 --> 01:09:54,148
DARK PROMINENCE

1057
01:10:03,282 --> 01:10:06,452
Unbelievable. What a troublesome brother.

1058
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:08,245
Once this is over,

1059
01:10:10,122 --> 01:10:11,665
{\an8}you owe me a drink!

1060
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:14,668
Sure!

1061
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:28,182
You chose to destroy
the balance of this world.

1062
01:10:28,265 --> 01:10:30,684
You are bringing forth an age of Chaos!

1063
01:10:31,268 --> 01:10:33,604
No matter what kind of age it is,

1064
01:10:33,687 --> 01:10:35,940
we'll decide our fate ourselves!

1065
01:10:36,023 --> 01:10:39,443
We're done playing along with your games!

1066
01:10:56,877 --> 01:10:59,755
-Combo Move! Tyrant Killing!
-Combo Move! Tyrant Killing!

1067
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:33,747
Thanks.

1068
01:11:44,091 --> 01:11:45,426
Captain!

1069
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:47,469
I expected nothing less.

1070
01:11:48,053 --> 01:11:51,015
-You are our hero!
-Amazing!

1071
01:11:51,098 --> 01:11:52,141
Meliodas!

1072
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:06,739
The age of gods is over.

1073
01:12:39,646 --> 01:12:40,773
Well then…

1074
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:41,899
Now…

1075
01:12:41,982 --> 01:12:42,816
Well then…

1076
01:12:52,284 --> 01:12:55,913
Let's celebrate their wedding!

1077
01:12:55,996 --> 01:12:58,582
It's time for an extravagant banquet!

1078
01:13:05,464 --> 01:13:06,965
Father!

1079
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:11,553
Hey, Hawk and Wild. You showed up.

1080
01:13:11,637 --> 01:13:15,516
Of course! You okay, King?

1081
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:20,104
My body is as soft as a cushion! Fret not.

1082
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:28,570
Meliodas? My father is calling you.

1083
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:30,989
Meliodas? Where are you?

1084
01:13:37,913 --> 01:13:39,581
You're a weird one.

1085
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:42,334
You became the king of a human kingdom.

1086
01:13:43,001 --> 01:13:44,878
I'm sure you'll have it tough too.

1087
01:13:44,962 --> 01:13:47,214
But good luck, new Demon King.

1088
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:50,467
That name sounds weak. Don't call me that!

1089
01:13:51,009 --> 01:13:51,844
Really?

1090
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:55,514
By the way,
will you and Gelda get married?

1091
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:59,476
I have no interest
in the customs of humans!

1092
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:03,105
Even without doing that,
my heart belongs to Gelda.

1093
01:14:04,148 --> 01:14:06,150
She's a good woman.

1094
01:14:06,233 --> 01:14:07,317
Yes.

1095
01:14:11,738 --> 01:14:14,116
Come to the Demon Realm sometime.

1096
01:14:16,034 --> 01:14:16,869
Can I?

1097
01:14:18,078 --> 01:14:21,874
I'm just telling you
to help repair the castle and town.

1098
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:24,460
I see.

1099
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:29,756
Goodbye, Meliodas.

1100
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:35,345
Yeah!

1101
01:18:56,857 --> 01:18:59,151
The age of gods is over.

1102
01:19:01,486 --> 01:19:07,117
And thus, the age of Chaos
for humanity begins.

1103
