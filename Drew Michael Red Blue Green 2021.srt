DREW MICHAEL:
It's nice to see you people.

6
00:00:37,626 --> 00:00:41,626
I have a hard time
with people, so here we go.

7
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:43,334
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

8
00:00:43,417 --> 00:00:45,834
Well, it's always been hard
for me to connect with people

9
00:00:45,918 --> 00:00:47,125
throughout my whole life,

10
00:00:47,209 --> 00:00:49,000
and I think there's, you know,
a lot of reasons for that.

11
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:53,250
Um, I have a hearing loss
that I've had since I was a kid.

12
00:00:53,334 --> 00:00:54,959
When I was three years old...

13
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:57,542
I failed a hearing test.

14
00:00:57,626 --> 00:01:00,918
I took a hearing test
and the doctor said,

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,792
"You failed the hearing test."

16
00:01:04,876 --> 00:01:07,667
Well, I didn't know
what he said, but...

17
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:10,083
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

18
00:01:10,167 --> 00:01:12,584
...he said something,
and my parents got upset,

19
00:01:12,667 --> 00:01:15,000
so I assumed
I didn't nail it, and...

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,209
So he told my parents,
he said,

21
00:01:18,292 --> 00:01:19,500
"This kid needs hearing aids."

22
00:01:19,584 --> 00:01:23,500
And so instead of doing that,
they didn't. So we just...

23
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,417
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

24
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:27,500
...coasted until I was 21.

25
00:01:27,584 --> 00:01:28,834
I didn't wear them
till I was 21.

26
00:01:28,918 --> 00:01:31,000
I wore them for like a week
when I was in fifth grade,

27
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:33,000
but then this girl I had
a crush on asked about them.

28
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:34,292
She's like,
"What's in your ear?"

29
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:36,250
I was like, "Well, that's
the end of that forever."

30
00:01:36,334 --> 00:01:39,417
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

31
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,876
"So I'll figure...
I'll figure it out."

32
00:01:44,834 --> 00:01:47,375
It instilled this kinda sense
of shame in me.

33
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:49,626
You know, I took it
as something was wrong with me.

34
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:52,709
I put it on myself.
I go, "I must be fucked up."

35
00:01:52,792 --> 00:01:54,709
And then I'm like,
"No, my doctor fucked up."

36
00:01:54,792 --> 00:01:56,626
And then my friends were like,
"No, dude, your parents,

37
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:59,834
your parents fucked up."

38
00:01:59,918 --> 00:02:02,792
And it's like, "Oh, cool,
well, add it to their tab."

39
00:02:02,876 --> 00:02:04,542
-Like, I don't know...
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

40
00:02:04,626 --> 00:02:06,292
They got a long tab running,
you know.

41
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:08,125
Also, they got divorced
when I was 12,

42
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:09,876
which is, like,
the most "fuck you" age

43
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:11,334
-you could possibly...
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

44
00:02:11,417 --> 00:02:13,709
Like, you guys weren't, like,
killing it when I was five.

45
00:02:13,792 --> 00:02:17,042
You couldn't have done it then?
You had to wait until I was 12?

46
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:18,417
They did do the thing
where they--

47
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,959
This is a common thing
I think parents do

48
00:02:20,042 --> 00:02:21,584
when they get divorced,
they tell their kids--

49
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:23,626
They told me,
"It's not your fault.

50
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:24,918
Don't worry,
it's not your fault."

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,542
It's like, "Yeah, first of all,
I wasn't thinking that.

52
00:02:27,626 --> 00:02:28,834
Uh...

53
00:02:28,918 --> 00:02:31,292
I don't know why you thought
I thought it was on me.

54
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:32,751
Have you seen you guys?

55
00:02:32,834 --> 00:02:34,334
Mom is cripplingly insecure,

56
00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:35,959
and Dad's addicted
to prostitutes.

57
00:02:36,042 --> 00:02:39,417
On what fucking world
is this on me?"

(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

59
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:45,417
I didn't have a good
blueprint...

60
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,167
for what a relationship
should look like,

61
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,959
so, you know,
I've struggled accordingly.

62
00:02:50,042 --> 00:02:51,667
I've had issues
in relationships.

63
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:53,667
There's other reasons
for that, too.

64
00:02:53,751 --> 00:02:56,500
Like it can't be a good thing...
(CHUCKLES)

65
00:02:56,584 --> 00:02:59,667
It can't be a good thing
that the first...

66
00:03:00,876 --> 00:03:02,083
2,000...

67
00:03:03,167 --> 00:03:05,167
sexual experiences of my life...

(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

69
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:11,209
...were with a Dell computer.
Like that can't be...

70
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:13,083
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

71
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:14,792
It can't be helping.

72
00:03:14,876 --> 00:03:16,584
It can't be pushing me
in the right direction

73
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:19,042
on this pursuit of love
and happiness that I'm on.

74
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,042
Two thousand.
That's the number, by the way.

75
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,959
I didn't, like, write down
a funny number for you.

76
00:03:23,042 --> 00:03:24,834
-I counted.
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

77
00:03:24,918 --> 00:03:27,584
It's literally 2,000,
age 12 to 19

78
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:30,626
was exclusively
that every single day.

79
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:32,500
I bought a computer
for my family

80
00:03:32,584 --> 00:03:33,626
with my bar mitzvah money,

81
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:35,959
and then I fucked it
for seven years straight.

82
00:03:36,042 --> 00:03:38,709
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

83
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:39,918
That's how I began.

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,500
That is the origin story
to my sexual identity,

85
00:03:42,584 --> 00:03:45,834
just downloading sexist shit
into my head.

86
00:03:45,918 --> 00:03:47,542
Then waltzing out
into the world like,

87
00:03:47,626 --> 00:03:49,459
"Oh, yeah,
I totally respect people."

88
00:03:49,542 --> 00:03:51,584
How? How is that even possible?

89
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:55,167
It's so corrosive.
That shit will rot your brain.

90
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,667
And it's certainly,
for a young boy,

91
00:03:57,751 --> 00:04:00,751
like, it's insane.
Even now, it's like...

92
00:04:00,834 --> 00:04:02,417
We like to pretend
like it's fine,

93
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,751
but that's only because
we don't have to acknowledge

94
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:06,125
what it is that we're doing.

95
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:09,334
It's like this virtual,
wordless escapade.

96
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:11,792
You never have to be accountable
for what it is you're doing.

97
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,375
I think before...

98
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:18,167
you're allowed
to click on a video...

99
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,417
you should have to say
the title out loud.

100

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

101
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:31,417
How badly do you want this?

102
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,709
I feel like
most people are like,

103
00:04:32,792 --> 00:04:34,834
"I'm just gonna call my mom
and reconnect...

104
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:39,375
-the person I need to be."
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

105
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:44,125
And it's bled in.
Yeah, my relationship dynamics

106
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:46,626
have always been
somewhat turbulent.

107
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:47,792
A lot of back and forth,

108
00:04:47,876 --> 00:04:49,918
break up, get back together
kind of things.

109
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,626
A lot of things
that start really quickly.

110
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:54,000
It's like immediate intensity,

111
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,209
you know? Because usually
I feel like shit about myself

112
00:04:56,292 --> 00:04:57,709
and they feel like shit
about themselves,

113
00:04:57,792 --> 00:04:58,959
and we come together
and we're like,

114
00:04:59,042 --> 00:05:00,042
"Well, we have each other.

115
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,209
And we can do all this stuff!

116
00:05:01,292 --> 00:05:02,542
We can do
all this stuff together

117
00:05:02,626 --> 00:05:03,834
now that we're both here.

118
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:07,834
We can rub each other's heads.
We can take naps together.

119
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:09,417
We can, like, slow dance
in the kitchen

120
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,709
while we're waiting
for our cookies

121
00:05:10,792 --> 00:05:13,000
to finish baking." How specific
do you want me to get?

122
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,500
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

123
00:05:15,584 --> 00:05:16,959
But then
when I have all that stuff,

124
00:05:17,042 --> 00:05:18,125
I'm able to see, I'm like,

125
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:19,876
"Oh, this is a very
codependent relationship,

126
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,042
this isn't healthy.

127
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,834
This isn't the kind of thing
I wanna be in long term.

128
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:24,667
You're not the person
that's right for me."

129
00:05:24,751 --> 00:05:26,209
So I'll be like,
"Maybe we should break up."

130
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:29,459
But then they leave,
they take all the stuff!

131
00:05:29,542 --> 00:05:31,667
I'm like,
"I wanna break up with you,

132
00:05:31,751 --> 00:05:33,459
but you should love me still.

133
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:36,209
Like, you should still
give me all the things,

134
00:05:36,292 --> 00:05:37,667
just don't ask me for anything."

135
00:05:37,751 --> 00:05:39,417
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
-Like, "I need you.

136
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,584
Like, this is all built off
of the back of you.

137
00:05:41,667 --> 00:05:44,375
Like, your love for me
gave me the confidence

138
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:46,667
to even feel like
I could break up with you."

139
00:05:46,751 --> 00:05:49,167
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

140
00:05:50,792 --> 00:05:54,000
"I never would've broken up
with you if I was by myself."

141
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,626
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

142
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:01,500
But it's a self-esteem thing.
I don't feel--

143
00:06:01,584 --> 00:06:04,626
I don't feel, like, good enough
for the person that I...

144
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:07,292
that would be right for me,
you know?

145
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,000
So, what if--
I play this in my head.

146
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:13,959
What it feels like I need to do
is I need to find a girlfriend,

147
00:06:14,042 --> 00:06:17,250
uh, in order to be
confident enough

148
00:06:17,334 --> 00:06:21,292
to be the type of person
that I would need to be

149
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:26,751
in order to attract the girl
that I actually want to be with.

150
00:06:26,834 --> 00:06:28,792
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

151
00:06:31,751 --> 00:06:32,751
On my own, I'm nothing,

152
00:06:32,834 --> 00:06:34,709
but in a relationship,
I'm kind of a catch.

153
00:06:34,792 --> 00:06:37,459
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

154
00:06:39,417 --> 00:06:40,584
(CHUCKLES)

155
00:06:43,876 --> 00:06:45,167
I feel like
this is a common phenomenon,

156
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,167
that love at first sight,
that idea, it gets propagated.

157
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,918
We all know what you mean by it,
"love at first sight."

158
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,876
And it's something
that's a really enchanting idea,

159
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,500
you know? 'Cause you're like,

160
00:06:55,584 --> 00:06:57,375
you know,
one minute you're alone,

161
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:58,792
the next minute
you've found the one.

162
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,167
It's like, "What a...
What a day." (CHUCKLES)

163
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,667
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
-What a day that would be.

164
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,500
And so it's so enticing,
but I've seen--

165
00:07:08,584 --> 00:07:10,417
I've gone
that route so many times,

166
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,334
I know what's
on the back end of it,

167
00:07:12,417 --> 00:07:14,417
so it's hard for me
not to be cynical about it.

168
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,959
Now when I hear people like,
"We knew right away..."

169
00:07:17,626 --> 00:07:19,459
Did you?

170
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:20,959
'Cause now anytime I hear
someone say

171
00:07:21,042 --> 00:07:22,209
about their own relationship,

172
00:07:22,292 --> 00:07:24,083
"We knew right away,"
all I hear is,

173
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:26,167
"We were
both abandoned as children."

174
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,250
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

175
00:07:29,292 --> 00:07:30,792
You knew right away?
Your threshold

176
00:07:30,876 --> 00:07:32,709
for loving a person
is you saw them once?

177
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:35,167
That seems like a low bar
to clear.

178
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,542
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

179
00:07:36,626 --> 00:07:38,083
I feel like maybe
you can't handle

180
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:39,542
the anxiety of uncertainty,

181
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,709
so you went from zero
to 100 right away

182
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:43,667
to skip over
that prospect of rejection

183
00:07:43,751 --> 00:07:45,250
and the risk
that they might not be

184
00:07:45,334 --> 00:07:47,209
who you imagine them to be.
Am I close?

185
00:07:47,292 --> 00:07:48,375
Am I fucking close?

186
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:50,334
-Like, I feel like that...
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

187
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:51,876
...is a more accurate
characterization

188
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,000
of what we're talking about.

189
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,876
If you're drawn to somebody
that quickly,

190
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:57,792
that strongly, that intensely,
that immediately,

191
00:07:57,876 --> 00:07:59,167
that's not love.

192
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,459
You probably have
unresolved trauma.

193
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:03,292
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

194
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:06,083
And the other person probably
represents an embodiment

195
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:09,292
of the trigger of that trauma,
so you're drawn to them

196
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:12,167
in this misguided attempt
to retroactively fix

197
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,334
a fucked-up period in your past.

198
00:08:14,417 --> 00:08:16,626
That's not love!
Don't call that love.

199
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:18,042
Don't rebrand that as love

200
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,500
and make the rest
of us feel bad.

201
00:08:19,584 --> 00:08:22,125
Don't be out in the world like,
"It was love at first sight."

202
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:24,876
Say something honest like,
"It was 'I felt the way I did

203
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:26,876
when my dad left'
at first sight."

204
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:29,334
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-I'll believe that.

205

I'll believe that, yeah.

"My husband's face
looks just like the back

207
00:08:34,834 --> 00:08:37,167
of my father's head,
so I chased it..."

(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

210
00:08:43,292 --> 00:08:45,167
You should not be chasing.
Don't chase.

211
00:08:45,918 --> 00:08:47,500
Love should not be chased.

(GASPS)

213
00:08:49,792 --> 00:08:52,042
You shouldn't have that, like,
"Are we gonna make it?"

214
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:53,459
(CHUCKLES) No!

215

( AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

216
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,334
If you're wondering, no.
You should not be chasing.

217
00:08:58,417 --> 00:09:00,667
Like in movies, like,
to propagate this idea,

218
00:09:00,751 --> 00:09:02,459
"chase them,"
and that rom-com fantasy

219
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,542
of chasing someone
to an airport.

220
00:09:04,626 --> 00:09:07,459
Chase a therapist to an airport.
Like, don't...

221
00:09:07,542 --> 00:09:09,459
Like, "Don't leave,
we have so much work to do!"

(CHUCKLES)

224
00:09:15,584 --> 00:09:17,375
No, 'cause movies have
to show you--

225
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:19,459
They can't show you
what love actually is.

226
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:23,042
We don't wanna see it.
Love isn't entertaining.

227
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,584
They have to show some dramatic,
conflicted version of love.

228
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:26,834
They don't...

229
00:09:26,918 --> 00:09:29,250
We don't wanna see love,
actual love.

230
00:09:29,334 --> 00:09:31,542
It's beautiful. I'm not
shitting on the sentiment.

231
00:09:31,626 --> 00:09:33,584
It's an amazing thing
between the two people.

232
00:09:33,667 --> 00:09:35,167
It's not fun to watch.

233
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,292
Think about a couple you know,
maybe you are that couple,

234
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,751
who are truly in love,
in love, like,

235
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,542
together, good, healthy.

236
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,125
We don't wanna watch that.

-If you--
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

238

If you watched a movie
about a couple in love,

239
00:09:51,417 --> 00:09:52,959
you would just be on your couch

240
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:55,417
watching a couple
on their couch,

241
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,125
watching a better movie.

What are they watching?
I'll just watch that.

-AUDIENCE MEMBER: Oh, my God.
-That's not what they show you.

249
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
'Cause we don't wanna see--

250
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,959
We don't wanna see healthy,
good love.

251
00:10:19,042 --> 00:10:20,834
We wanna see, like,
a manifestation of, like,

252
00:10:20,918 --> 00:10:23,083
our own internal dramas
played out...

253
00:10:23,834 --> 00:10:25,125
for entertainment value.

254
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:26,751
The problem is
there are people out there,

255
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:27,959
like when I was a kid,

256
00:10:28,042 --> 00:10:31,834
who are like empty canvases,
who internalized that.

257
00:10:31,918 --> 00:10:33,584
And so it starts
to skew their view

258
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:34,709
of what love could be.

259
00:10:34,792 --> 00:10:36,000
Like, people who don't have
a healthy blueprint

260
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,459
are gonna absorb that
and take that in.

261
00:10:38,542 --> 00:10:41,876
You know, I was 12 years old
when the movie Titanic came out,

262
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:43,334
and that was, like,

263
00:10:43,417 --> 00:10:46,459
iconic love story.
Like, here it is,

264
00:10:46,542 --> 00:10:51,042
epic love,
cruelly interrupted by fate.

265
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:54,042
And I look at that movie now,
I'm like,

266
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,626
"Wait, what were we rooting
for here?

267
00:10:56,709 --> 00:10:59,834
What did we want to happen?
For them to get to New York?

268
00:10:59,918 --> 00:11:03,000
They weren't gonna
make it as a couple."

269
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,209
What did we think?
They're 20 years old,

270
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:07,167
they've known
each other two days.

271
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,918
I don't know everything
about relationships,

272
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,250
but like, hey, maybe don't marry

00:11:10,334 --> 00:11:12,375
the artist you fucked
on a cruise.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

275
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,709
Maybe that's not the move.

276
00:11:21,834 --> 00:11:24,209
Five minutes after you tried
to kill yourself.

277
00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:25,542
Do you remember
that's how they met?

278
00:11:25,626 --> 00:11:28,918
She was trying to kill herself
by jumping off the boat,

279
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,459
and he was like,
"Hey, I'm pretty hot.

280
00:11:30,542 --> 00:11:32,292
What if you didn't do that?"
And so...

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

282
00:11:35,584 --> 00:11:37,959
That's how they started.
They knew right away.

283
00:11:38,042 --> 00:11:40,292
Like, that's the thing,
is like, what happens?

284
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,375
How is that gonna play out?

285
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:43,083
Even if they get
to New York, what?

-They have nothing in common.
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

287
00:11:47,584 --> 00:11:49,125
You know what I mean?
Like, all they have is

288
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,167
the excitement
that they made it.

289
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,584
That lasts, what?
Six months, a year...

290
00:11:54,292 --> 00:11:56,500
two years, maybe?

291
00:11:56,584 --> 00:11:59,250
What happens five, ten years
down the road?

292
00:11:59,334 --> 00:12:01,459
Just sittin' there.
He's like, "So...

293
00:12:03,042 --> 00:12:05,542
you want me to draw you?"
She's like, "Fuck you!"

294

didn't hit the iceberg..."

the rest of Rose's life.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

309
00:12:54,626 --> 00:12:56,083
I like movies, I do.

310
00:12:57,709 --> 00:12:59,209
I do.

311
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:00,876
I don't like
movie culture, though,

312
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,250
like Hollywood...

313
00:13:02,334 --> 00:13:04,292
like the culture surrounding it.
And every time I get roped

314
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,209
into watching an award show,
I'm always reminded,

315
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:08,542
like, who the fuck
makes these things.

316
00:13:08,626 --> 00:13:10,542
It's like, "Oh, my God."
You ever watch an award show?

317
00:13:10,626 --> 00:13:12,459
It's like this shouldn't be
on television.

318
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,709
This should be, like...

319
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,709
like, in an underground cave
at Bohemian Grove.

320
00:13:18,792 --> 00:13:22,792
Like, why is this
in front of the public?

321
00:13:22,876 --> 00:13:25,792
'Cause they try to act
like they're down-to-earth.

322
00:13:25,876 --> 00:13:28,125
Every time an actor
wins an award,
they always give some--

323
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:29,667
It's not some, like,
normal speech,

324
00:13:29,751 --> 00:13:32,709
it's like a lofty,
sociopolitical response

325
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:34,250
to the moment.

326
00:13:34,334 --> 00:13:36,751
It's like,
"We need to find a way.

00:13:36,834 --> 00:13:38,375
There's a lot of problems
in the world.

328

We need to find a way
to come together

329
00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:43,500
and not let it divide us."

330
00:13:43,584 --> 00:13:46,334
Like Meryl Streep,
"We need to come together."

-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
-"Find unity and strength,

-And find strength and unity."

"Come together as a globe,
as a nation, as a people."

I'm always like,
"Yeah, uh, you're wearing

336

a diamond dress from Givenchy."

337
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:11,083

are you part of "the people"?

-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
-Like, what do you think?

339
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:15,751
Like, if there was
a true people's revolution,

340
00:14:15,834 --> 00:14:18,209
like a people's uprising,
it's gonna be your blood

341
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:21,167
-splattered on the sidewalk.
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

342
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,334
They're not gonna spare you

343
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:24,167
'cause they liked
Devil Wears Prada.

344
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,500
They're gonna rip
your fucking head off,

345
00:14:26,584 --> 00:14:27,876
stick it on a stake,

346
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:30,792
and sell that diamond dress
to a cartel for machine guns.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

348
00:14:32,292 --> 00:14:34,209
They're not gonna be like,
"Oh, get in the bunker.

349
00:14:34,292 --> 00:14:37,459
We love the nuance
of your artistic choices.

350
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,792
It was so brave of you,
how you dared,

351
00:14:40,876 --> 00:14:43,709
oh, how you dared to be
a middle-class character."

352
00:14:43,792 --> 00:14:46,500
Like, "Oh, how you pretended
to be a thing

353
00:14:46,584 --> 00:14:49,709

How did you do it?

354
00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:52,918
How did you prepare
for the role?"

355
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,500
And they're always like,
"Oh, I lived amongst plumbers

-for eight months."

359
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:08,000
No, that's it, you can't.
You can't preach togetherness

360
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:11,083
and unity when you're that rich.
You just can't do it.

361
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:14,209
You're rich. You're super rich.

362
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:16,417
That's why you got rich,

363
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,709
is to get the fuck away
from everybody.

(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

365
00:15:22,417 --> 00:15:23,292
That's what money is.

366
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,709
Money is just an escape
from people.

367
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:27,709
That's why we want it.

368
00:15:28,584 --> 00:15:29,584
Everything money does for you.

369
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:31,918
Doesn't even have
to be a lot of money.

370
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,667
You'd be like,
"Ooh, I can afford an Uber."

371
00:15:33,751 --> 00:15:36,500
What's an Uber?
That is a bus for one person.

I just wish
there were no people on it

where I want it to go."

377
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:54,000
Yeah, you can do that.
You gotta pay for it.

378
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:56,167
You wanna join a gym,

379
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,417
there's different kinds of gyms,
right?

380
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,334
There's a whole spectrum
of gym options.

381
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,042
There's a ten-dollar-a-month gym
on one end.

382
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,709
Two-hundred-dollar-a-month gym
on the other end.

383
00:16:02,792 --> 00:16:04,042
What's the difference?

384
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,834
Two-hundred-dollar-a-month gym,
it's nicer.

385
00:16:05,918 --> 00:16:07,709
It's not 20 times nicer.

386
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:09,042
It's not like
the ten-dollar-a-month gym,

387
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,209
the walls are falling off,

388
00:16:10,292 --> 00:16:11,459
and you pick up
the ten-pound weight

389
00:16:11,542 --> 00:16:12,542
and it's 100 pounds.

390
00:16:12,626 --> 00:16:13,918
You're like,
"Oh, fuck this gym!

391
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,834
The dumbbells
are Gatorade bottles

392
00:16:16,918 --> 00:16:18,792
filled with rocks,
this gym sucks."

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

394
00:16:23,334 --> 00:16:24,667
No, there's still
equipment there.

395
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:27,167
The 200-dollar-a-month gym,
you pay 200 dollars a month

396
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,667
so you don't have to
look at people

397
00:16:28,751 --> 00:16:30,417
who can only afford
ten dollars a month.

398
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,542
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-That's what you're paying for.

399
00:16:32,626 --> 00:16:34,167
You wanna be able
to do a pull-up

400
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,083
without being reminded
of the dark underbelly

401
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:37,918
-of capitalism.
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

402
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,417
It's a 190-dollar surcharge

403
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,918
to not have to make eye contact
with the consolation prize

404
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,375
in this fucked-up game
we're all playing here.

405
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,250
That's what you're paying for.
That's the premium.

406
00:16:47,334 --> 00:16:49,167
Everything money does
for you just pushes you

407
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,792
further and further away
from everybody else.

408
00:16:51,876 --> 00:16:53,667
You wanna fly,
you buy a plane ticket.

409
00:16:53,751 --> 00:16:55,667
First-class ticket,
way more expensive.

410
00:16:55,751 --> 00:16:57,918
Why?
There's less people up there.

411
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,334
They won't tell you that.
They'll be like,

412
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:01,709
"No, you get more space."
It's like, yeah, motherfucker,

413
00:17:01,792 --> 00:17:04,167
space is just the absence
of people.

414
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,959
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-It's not a new entity.

415
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:09,500
Space is a euphemism
for not anybody.

416
00:17:10,626 --> 00:17:11,709
"No, you get all this legroom."

417
00:17:11,792 --> 00:17:13,292
Yeah, 'cause they're no people
in the way

418
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,042
of where my legs
are trying to go.

419
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:16,959
We could all have
legroom back here

420
00:17:17,042 --> 00:17:18,918
if we weren't all back here.

421
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,918
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

422
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:27,125
Now, could you imagine
if two people in economy class

423
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:28,876
were, like,
fighting over the armrest,

424
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:30,792
and some asshole
from first class came back

425
00:17:30,876 --> 00:17:33,792
and was like, "Hey!
We need to all work together.

426
00:17:33,876 --> 00:17:37,459
We need to find
unity and strength as a flight.

427
00:17:37,542 --> 00:17:40,751
We're all flight 348,
after all."

428
00:17:40,834 --> 00:17:42,042
Then they swoosh the curtain

429
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,292
and go back to their
apartment in the sky.

430
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,626
How quickly before the back rows

431
00:17:46,709 --> 00:17:48,959
start bundling their
plastic silverware together

432
00:17:49,042 --> 00:17:50,167
to storm the front?

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

434
00:17:51,542 --> 00:17:53,417
Like, "No, no, we're not trying
to hijack the plane,

435
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,918
we're just trying to kill
rows one through five.

436
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,167
Take their hot towels
and orange juice

437
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,334
and spread it around."

439
00:18:01,584 --> 00:18:03,125
That's the fantasy.
Everyone fantasizes

440
00:18:03,209 --> 00:18:04,667
about what they would do
when they get rich.

441
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:06,292
You wanna get away
from everybody.

442
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:09,959
Nobody fantasizes
about togetherness.

443
00:18:10,042 --> 00:18:13,250
Nobody's like, "Oh, dude,
if I got rich... (CHUCKLES)

444
00:18:13,334 --> 00:18:16,042
I would get
so many roommates."

around my house.

00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,292
People aren't gonna be able
to ring my doorbell

against rich people.

You just can't have it
both ways.

455
00:18:41,459 --> 00:18:43,542
You can't bridge class
with a speech.

456
00:18:44,292 --> 00:18:45,250
You can't have it all

457
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:46,626
and then have this, like,
faux empathy.

458
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:50,125

00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,876
if entertainment
is gonna be this ubiquitous,

You know, 'cause I grew up,

542
00:22:19,042 --> 00:22:21,584
entertainment was
important to me.

543
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:23,417
And so, you know,
I looked to it for something,

544
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,918
and to be that devoid
of substance, it feels...

545
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:28,083
insulting.

546
00:22:29,876 --> 00:22:32,792
The problem with entertainment
is that it's all made...

547
00:22:32,876 --> 00:22:36,459
by the same type of person.
It's made by entertainers.

548

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,292
Where does Mickey Mouse stand
on abortion? I don't know.

672
00:27:41,375 --> 00:27:43,709
Is he a "second trimester
or before" kind of mouse,

673
00:27:43,792 --> 00:27:46,459
or more like a hardline...
(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) "Life
begins at conception, folks."

674
00:27:46,542 --> 00:27:49,292
Like, I don't know
what Mickey thinks.

675
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:50,751
Does Mickey think,
or does he just do

676
00:27:50,834 --> 00:27:52,459
whatever the artist
makes him do?

677
00:27:52,542 --> 00:27:53,959
Is there a consciousness
in Mickey?

678
00:27:54,042 --> 00:27:56,000
Do any of us think,
or are we just being guided

679
00:27:56,083 --> 00:27:57,083
by an unseen hand?

680
00:27:57,167 --> 00:27:58,584
Is thinking part
of the illusion?

681
00:27:58,667 --> 00:27:59,834
Is Descartes a fraud?

682
00:27:59,918 --> 00:28:01,417
This is why
I had to get off of Twitter.

683
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,751
I existentially spiral.
I lose who I am.

684
00:28:06,292 --> 00:28:08,584
I did, I deleted my Twitter
a year ago.

685
00:28:10,667 --> 00:28:13,125
I still have Instagram
because I'm stupid.

686
00:28:13,209 --> 00:28:15,083
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

687
00:28:15,167 --> 00:28:19,459
Instagram is... It's like hell.
It's just like hell.

688
00:28:19,542 --> 00:28:22,542
You can download
hell to your phone for free.

689
00:28:22,626 --> 00:28:24,709
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-It's free. Hell is free.

690
00:28:26,459 --> 00:28:28,042
Instagram is just like, "Hey...

691
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:32,918
uh, are you not feeling
jealous today?"

692
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

693
00:28:35,751 --> 00:28:37,876
"Come hang out.

694
00:28:37,959 --> 00:28:40,125
Look, there's a beer,
some food you'll never eat.

695
00:28:40,209 --> 00:28:43,334
Go fuck yourself. We hate you.

696
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:46,626
We are trying to tear you down.
We don't give a fuck.

697
00:28:46,709 --> 00:28:48,000
Here's places you'll never go.

698
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:49,626
Here's a person
that will never fuck you.

699
00:28:49,709 --> 00:28:52,792
Go fuck yourself. We hate you."

700
00:28:52,876 --> 00:28:54,626
"We are manipulating
your emotions,

701
00:28:54,709 --> 00:28:55,709
and then monitoring them

702
00:28:55,792 --> 00:28:57,584
so we can sell you shit.
You want a bracelet?

703
00:28:57,667 --> 00:29:00,083
Yeah, we knew you would,
motherfucker." Literally.

704
00:29:00,167 --> 00:29:01,709
Literally! Literally.

705
00:29:01,792 --> 00:29:03,584
People are like,
"What do those bracelets mean?"

706
00:29:03,667 --> 00:29:05,209
They mean I'm a fucking moron!

707
00:29:05,292 --> 00:29:06,417
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

708
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,375
They mean I was depressed
and got a targeted ad

709
00:29:08,459 --> 00:29:10,667
and thought these bracelets
would turn it all around.

710
00:29:10,751 --> 00:29:11,834
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

711
00:29:11,918 --> 00:29:13,626
That's what they mean.

712
00:29:13,709 --> 00:29:15,334
"You are nothing.
We have hollowed you out

713
00:29:15,417 --> 00:29:16,542
and emptied you

714
00:29:16,626 --> 00:29:18,334
and filled you with ourselves
and the desire for more.

715
00:29:18,417 --> 00:29:21,125
You are powerless against it.
This is a takeover.

716
00:29:21,209 --> 00:29:23,125
Didn't happen the way
it did in Terminator.

717
00:29:23,209 --> 00:29:25,375
It's a lot more subtle,
with more cat videos

718
00:29:25,459 --> 00:29:27,667
and 14-year-olds twerking.
Is that a crime?

719
00:29:27,751 --> 00:29:29,250
Ha, ha. We'll never tell you."

720
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:31,709
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

721
00:29:34,792 --> 00:29:35,918
I hate it.

722
00:29:36,709 --> 00:29:37,792
It makes me feel like shit.

723
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:39,876
The only social media site
that I like...

724
00:29:41,792 --> 00:29:43,751
is, uh, Venmo.

725
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:48,167
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

726
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,792
That's right. I like Venmo.

727
00:29:51,876 --> 00:29:54,000
Venmo's a money transfer app,
which everybody knows.

728
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,042
But what not everybody knows
is that on Venmo,

729
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:58,417
there's a feed,
where you can like...

730
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,959
tab over and you can see
all of your friends'

731
00:30:01,042 --> 00:30:03,042
and your contacts'
financial transactions,

732
00:30:03,125 --> 00:30:04,792
which should be illegal,
but it's there.

733
00:30:04,876 --> 00:30:05,959
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

734
00:30:06,042 --> 00:30:08,417
It's right there. And I like it
because it's honest.

735
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,542
It's the only honest
social media site out there.

736
00:30:10,626 --> 00:30:12,334
Every other social media site
is a projection

737
00:30:12,417 --> 00:30:15,876
of a version of yourself
that you wish you were
onto a canvas. Not Venmo.

738
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:19,417
Venmo is the honest antidote
to the horseshit of Instagram.

739
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,918
Instagram makes you feel bad

740
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,876
because you're aware
of your own fears

741
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:24,417
and insecurities
and preoccupations,

742
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,042
but you're not seeing
anybody else's.

743
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:27,542
So you're always
gonna lean that way.

744
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:30,042
So you see a picture on
Instagram of, like, a couple...

745
00:30:30,834 --> 00:30:33,417
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

746
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,876
Maybe they're on,
like, a beach...

747
00:30:37,959 --> 00:30:39,876
looking at a gorgeous sunset.

748
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,918
Maybe they're eating a pizza.

(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

750
00:30:46,876 --> 00:30:49,959
You look at this, you're like,
"What the fuck? What the fuck?

751
00:30:50,042 --> 00:30:51,167
The fuck is wrong with me?

752
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,209
How come
I'm not doing that shit, huh?

753
00:30:53,292 --> 00:30:54,417
Is there something
wrong with me?

754
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,751
Is there a hole here
that everybody can see?

755
00:30:56,834 --> 00:30:59,250
Do I emanate darkness,
do I repel love?

756
00:30:59,334 --> 00:31:01,542
Is there a limit
to my emotional aptitude?

757
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:03,626
Did my father's genetics
set that limit?

758
00:31:03,709 --> 00:31:05,334
Do I need to go back
on antidepressants?

759
00:31:05,417 --> 00:31:08,167
What the fuck
is going on inside of me

760
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,042
that's not leading me
to that type of bliss?

761
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:12,334
What do I have to do
to get there?"

762
00:31:12,417 --> 00:31:14,500
But then you look at Venmo
and it's like,

763
00:31:14,584 --> 00:31:17,375
"Oh, no, dude,
they split that pizza."

764
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:20,125
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

765
00:31:20,209 --> 00:31:24,042
(APPLAUSE)

766
00:31:31,792 --> 00:31:35,125
-"I'm doing just fine."
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

767
00:31:35,209 --> 00:31:36,584
"I don't need medication."

768
00:31:38,542 --> 00:31:40,500
(CHUCKLES)

769
00:31:40,584 --> 00:31:42,083
It's not a referendum
on splitting stuff

770
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:43,000
in a relationship.

771
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:44,334
I think
if you're gonna split stuff,

772
00:31:44,417 --> 00:31:46,042
just don't split the items.

773
00:31:46,667 --> 00:31:48,250
Go every other.

774
00:31:48,334 --> 00:31:49,751
Does that make sense?

775
00:31:49,834 --> 00:31:51,584
I'll see that on Venmo.
I go on Venmo, I'll see,

776
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:53,834
"Boyfriend sends girlfriend
money for tacos."

777
00:31:53,918 --> 00:31:55,918
I'm just, like, how the fuck
do you go down on someone

778
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,709
after you just sent them
eight bucks?

779

"You're just bitter, Drew,
that you have no one

782

to split stuff with."

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

784
00:32:15,709 --> 00:32:16,918
Yeah, I'm single.

785
00:32:17,542 --> 00:32:20,375
I'm 36... and single.

786
00:32:20,459 --> 00:32:22,959
I'm single and 36,
which is fine.

787
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:26,792
Uh, but it is almost not.

788
00:32:26,876 --> 00:32:29,042
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

789
00:32:30,667 --> 00:32:34,000
Like, it's not bad yet,
but bad is next.

00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:36,751
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

791
00:32:37,751 --> 00:32:41,500
Bad is the next stop
on this... train.

792
00:32:47,125 --> 00:32:49,959
A lot of my friends are married.

793
00:32:50,042 --> 00:32:51,292
And it's cool to see.

794
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:52,959
A lot of them are in, like,
really great relationships,

795
00:32:53,042 --> 00:32:54,876
really healthy, good,
loving relationships.

796
00:32:54,959 --> 00:32:55,959
And it's really amazing to see.

797
00:32:56,042 --> 00:32:57,751
I go to their weddings,
I really enjoy it.

798
00:32:57,834 --> 00:33:00,375
Seeing them come together,
it's a beautiful thing.

799
00:33:00,459 --> 00:33:03,292
And I hear a lot
of the same things in the vows.

800
00:33:03,375 --> 00:33:04,834
There's a common refrain
in the vows,

801
00:33:04,918 --> 00:33:06,334
which is something about,
like, you know,

802
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:08,584
"I get to marry my best friend."

803
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:11,500
"I'm so lucky to have found
my best friend."

804
00:33:11,584 --> 00:33:13,667
"I never thought I would spend
the rest of my life

805
00:33:13,751 --> 00:33:15,042
with my best friend."

806
00:33:16,042 --> 00:33:17,042
And I hear that, I'm like,

807
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:18,876
"That's such
a beautiful sentiment."

808
00:33:18,959 --> 00:33:22,334
Like, the person
you marry should feel...

809
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,918
like your best friend.

810
00:33:26,751 --> 00:33:28,918
I'm in the back,
I'm like, "Well, I'm 36,

811
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,959
so who the fuck
meets their best friend

812
00:33:32,042 --> 00:33:34,000
in their late thirties?"

814
00:33:35,334 --> 00:33:37,292
Who's out there like,
"This is my best friend!

00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:38,918
We met when were 38!"

No, it doesn't happen.

820
00:33:50,792 --> 00:33:53,542
They're all having kids, too,
starting families.

821
00:33:53,626 --> 00:33:56,876
My friends starting families,
it's beautiful to see.

822
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:59,125
I don't have my own family.

823
00:33:59,209 --> 00:34:01,918
I have, like, a family
from which I've come.

824
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,042
I don't have...

825
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:05,459
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
-...the next line on that.

826
00:34:05,542 --> 00:34:08,292
Like on a family tree,
I'm just a node that ends.

(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

828
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,667
It's just like, "Who's that?"

829
00:34:11,751 --> 00:34:13,959
"That's your great Uncle Drew,
nobody loved him."

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

831
00:34:15,542 --> 00:34:16,918
Just a leaf on a twig.

832
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,876
Just a Styrofoam ball
with no toothpicks,

833
00:34:18,959 --> 00:34:20,751
if we're using
school project lingo.

I love you, Dad."

-It's a good game.

"hugging my smiling child" good.

(AUDIENCE LAUGH)

842
00:34:48,751 --> 00:34:50,834
But the gameplay mechanics
are pretty tight.

843
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:53,792
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

844
00:34:58,375 --> 00:35:01,334
I think part of the reason
I don't... have a family,

845
00:35:01,417 --> 00:35:02,876
well, at least
what I used to tell myself,

846
00:35:02,959 --> 00:35:04,125
is that I do this.

847
00:35:04,209 --> 00:35:06,876
It's something that I chose.
I chose a different path.

848
00:35:06,959 --> 00:35:10,083
I remember I started doing
stand-up when I was 22.

849
00:35:10,167 --> 00:35:13,542
I dropped out of school, and...

850
00:35:13,626 --> 00:35:14,959
at the time,
my mother warned me.

851
00:35:15,042 --> 00:35:16,375
She said, "You know,
it's not very stable.

852
00:35:16,459 --> 00:35:18,459
You're gonna be living
hand-to-mouth, traveling a lot.

853
00:35:18,542 --> 00:35:20,626
You're not gonna be able
to settle down."

854
00:35:20,709 --> 00:35:22,542
And she was right to an extent.

855
00:35:22,626 --> 00:35:24,292
But the problem was,
she was telling this

856
00:35:24,375 --> 00:35:26,709
to a 22-year-old dude.

857
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:30,626
Like the least likely candidate
on Earth to settle down.

858
00:35:32,125 --> 00:35:33,834
I don't know if you know
any 22-year-old dudes,

859
00:35:33,918 --> 00:35:35,584
but they're
not technically people.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

861
00:35:38,584 --> 00:35:40,459
Just unprocessed pain and skin.

862
00:35:40,542 --> 00:35:43,500
Like, that's pretty much
the identity there.

863
00:35:44,334 --> 00:35:45,626
So, 22, I'm hearing this,

864
00:35:45,709 --> 00:35:48,334
I'm like, "Settle down?
What are you, a hundred?

865
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:50,334
I don't give a fuck.

866
00:35:51,584 --> 00:35:53,542
I'm going on the road, Mom.

867
00:35:54,334 --> 00:35:56,751
I'ma follow my dreams!

868
00:35:56,834 --> 00:35:59,083
Nobody is gonna stop me!"

869
00:36:00,667 --> 00:36:02,709
That was my attitude.
Now I'm 36.

870
00:36:02,792 --> 00:36:04,959
Now I see the punchline.
Now it's like...

871

(LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)

872
00:36:14,292 --> 00:36:17,626

(CHUCKLES SARCASTICALLY)

875
00:36:21,918 --> 00:36:23,125
Is that funny? I don't know.

876
00:36:23,209 --> 00:36:26,417
I structured it as a joke.
Does that make it funny?

877
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,083
I don't know. Does comedy have
the ability to transform

878
00:36:29,167 --> 00:36:31,042
the emotional constitution
of reality,

879
00:36:31,125 --> 00:36:34,709
or is it just adding a layer
to an unfortunate event?

880
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:37,459
I don't know how the physics
of comedy work.

881
00:36:41,209 --> 00:36:44,000
I used to tell myself that
it was a sacrifice I was making.

882
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:47,083
I was leaving that on the side
to pursue this.

883
00:36:47,918 --> 00:36:48,834
And I used to look--

884
00:36:48,918 --> 00:36:50,751
It was very easy
to make that argument,

885
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:53,584
'cause I used to look around
and there were a lot of men

886
00:36:53,667 --> 00:36:57,000
who accomplished things
that I considered to be great,

887
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:59,959
whose personal life was
kind of left by the wayside.

888
00:37:00,042 --> 00:37:02,459
And so it seemed to me
as a necessary component.

889
00:37:02,542 --> 00:37:05,459
I remember in high school
I learned about Isaac Newton.

890
00:37:05,542 --> 00:37:08,792
And Isaac Newton
invented calculus.

891
00:37:10,209 --> 00:37:11,876
He also died a virgin.

893
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,542

can you invent calculus

while fucking people?

it's documented,

into our pocket,

if Steve Jobs were a good dad,

908
00:37:56,459 --> 00:37:59,292

Every time you text someone

that's Steve Jobs not going

-or a softball game.

we have the right to judge him.

one girl grow up

than have to all of us
use Windows.

Are you out of
your fucking mind?

to click a Start button

can open her gifts

who paid for them?

from a nanny

or shut up! Like, we don't care.

So there's this incentive
to do it.

932
00:38:52,417 --> 00:38:55,250
And it gets even more fucked up.
Someone like Michael Jackson,

933
00:38:55,334 --> 00:38:59,667
who was this incredible popstar
and a horrendous babysitter,

No, but even that, like

940
00:39:10,417 --> 00:39:12,334
there's such an instinct
to defend these guys.

941
00:39:12,417 --> 00:39:13,834
Like my first instinct is
to be like--

942
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:16,500
see it from their side,
because I think we're such...

943
00:39:16,584 --> 00:39:19,125
we're conditioned to like them
on that level.

944
00:39:19,209 --> 00:39:20,417
So even with Michael,
I was like--

945
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,667
you know,
there was a part of me--

946
00:39:21,751 --> 00:39:23,000
I watched that documentary
about him,

947
00:39:23,083 --> 00:39:24,626
I was like,
"Oh, that's fucked up."

948
00:39:24,709 --> 00:39:26,125
But there was a part of me
that was like,

949
00:39:26,209 --> 00:39:27,918
"Yeah, but if not
an eight-year-old boy,

950
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,792

that makes any sense at all?

to Lisa Marie Presley,

they like did this kiss,

00:42:10,626 --> 00:42:13,209
to be intimate
with the people closest to him.

1012
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,709
Or with himself.

1013
00:42:17,417 --> 00:42:19,709
And so it recasts my own path,

1014
00:42:19,792 --> 00:42:22,000
where I'm like,
maybe this isn't a sacrifice.

1015
00:42:23,417 --> 00:42:25,167
I'm not comparing myself to...

1016
00:42:26,292 --> 00:42:28,083
Steve Jobs and...

1017
00:42:28,167 --> 00:42:30,918
Isaac Newton, you know.
It's a matter of scale.

1018
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,792
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

1019
00:42:33,876 --> 00:42:35,209
But even in the comedy world,

1020
00:42:35,292 --> 00:42:37,459
even the people
that I looked up to...

1021
00:42:37,542 --> 00:42:39,792
When I started, all the people
that I looked up to,

1022
00:42:39,876 --> 00:42:42,667
they're all either, like,
prematurely dead,

1023
00:42:42,751 --> 00:42:45,417
utterly miserable, or, like,
sex criminals.

1024
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,292
So... where is this headed?

1025
00:42:48,375 --> 00:42:51,083
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

1026
00:42:52,083 --> 00:42:53,751
Where is this path going?

1027
00:42:57,667 --> 00:43:00,209
Their greatness is predicated
on their accomplishments,

1028
00:43:00,292 --> 00:43:02,250
but we fail to recognize
how they failed

1029
00:43:02,334 --> 00:43:03,459
in their private moments.

1030
00:43:03,542 --> 00:43:07,042
And I think that's a masculine
definition of greatness.

1031
00:43:07,125 --> 00:43:09,709
Because, like, I don't look
at that as great anymore

1032
00:43:09,792 --> 00:43:12,667
because they couldn't confront
who they were as a person.

1033
00:43:12,751 --> 00:43:14,918
They couldn't confront
the emotional reality

1034
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
of their experience.

1035
00:43:16,083 --> 00:43:18,292
That is greatness to me.
To do that,

1036
00:43:18,375 --> 00:43:21,209
that is a much greater thing.

1037
00:43:21,292 --> 00:43:24,959
How great can something be
if it's built on avoidance?

1038
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:29,918
I think you have to...

1039
00:43:33,209 --> 00:43:34,250
confront.

1040
00:43:35,125 --> 00:43:36,167
And it's scary.

1041
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:38,375
It's a scary fucking thing
to do. Like, I get it.

1042
00:43:38,459 --> 00:43:41,167
It's like totally scary
for a lot of reasons.

1043
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:43,209
One, you can find out
that the story you've been

1044
00:43:43,292 --> 00:43:45,459
telling yourself about yourself
isn't true.

1045
00:43:45,542 --> 00:43:47,334
You can find out that
what you thought was like

1046
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:50,292
the harsh, brutal reality
of yourself,

1047
00:43:50,375 --> 00:43:52,751
you're just resting
on an easier narrative

1048
00:43:52,834 --> 00:43:55,042
that could be subverted
by something else.

1049
00:43:55,125 --> 00:43:57,542
Like I used to tell
myself stories about myself

1050
00:43:57,626 --> 00:43:59,042
that have shifted over time.

1051
00:43:59,125 --> 00:44:00,876
I used to tell myself
this was a sacrifice.

1052
00:44:00,959 --> 00:44:03,000
I used to tell myself
that what I was doing up here

1053
00:44:03,083 --> 00:44:05,542
was important,
that it was fearless.

1054
00:44:05,626 --> 00:44:06,918
That I was fearless
for doing this.

1055
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,751
I had the balls to say shit
that nobody else did.

1056
00:44:09,834 --> 00:44:11,334
Things like
that Michael Jackson joke,

1057
00:44:11,417 --> 00:44:13,167
I'd be like, "That's fearless.

1058
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,459
That's a fearless fucking thing.
You can get mad at me.

1059
00:44:15,542 --> 00:44:18,334
That's fearless.
I'm willing to stand that down."

1060
00:44:18,417 --> 00:44:20,000
But as I get older, I'm like,
"That's not...

1061
00:44:20,083 --> 00:44:22,334
I think it's funny,
but it's not fearless."

1062
00:44:22,417 --> 00:44:25,459
Because my emotional experience
is nowhere in there.

1063
00:44:26,375 --> 00:44:27,918
I'm nowhere in that joke.

1064
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:30,751
I wasn't molested,

1065
00:44:31,792 --> 00:44:33,167
and I'm not a pedophile.

1067
00:44:36,375 --> 00:44:37,834

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

1069
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,876
The most fearless pedophile joke
you could tell

1070
00:44:44,959 --> 00:44:47,209
is to be one
and admit it publicly.

the joke bombs
and you don't like it.

1074
00:44:55,751 --> 00:44:59,125
You look at me, arms folded,
shaking your head and say, "No."

1075
00:44:59,209 --> 00:45:01,209
Fortunately, that didn't happen
this evening,

1076
00:45:01,292 --> 00:45:03,417
but it has happened.

1077
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,334
It could happen.
You can get mad.

1078
00:45:05,417 --> 00:45:08,959
You could think I suck.
You could not like me.

1079

I can barely see any of you,
and I love none of you.

1083
00:45:25,209 --> 00:45:28,834
So what is this power...
that you hold over me?

1084

our most terrifying audience.

I believe that.

1087
00:45:37,834 --> 00:45:39,334
That's why it's so funny
when people say

1088
00:45:39,417 --> 00:45:40,959
that, like, public speaking

1089
00:45:41,042 --> 00:45:42,584
is the number one fear
of people.

1090
00:45:42,667 --> 00:45:43,959
They say, you hear that,
"Public speaking

not on that questionnaire?"

public speaking?

1099
00:45:58,918 --> 00:46:02,459

I have used this
to avoid so many--

I can't tell you how many
relationships I've been in

"Oh, sorry, I can't hang out

It's like just,
"Do I need any of this?"

1114
00:46:37,626 --> 00:46:40,083
And I think as men,
we have this tendency

1115
00:46:40,167 --> 00:46:42,626
to wanna process everything
in our lives through,

1116
00:46:42,709 --> 00:46:46,584
you know, intellect, or logic,
or our thoughts, or our reason,

1117
00:46:46,667 --> 00:46:48,459
things that we do,
things that are tactile,

1118
00:46:48,542 --> 00:46:50,042
and it's like...

1119
00:46:50,125 --> 00:46:53,042
you're ignoring the entire
emotional subset

1120

of your experience.

1121
00:46:54,459 --> 00:46:56,959
And this idea that logic
and emotions are separate,

1122
00:46:57,042 --> 00:46:58,125
they're not.

1123
00:46:58,209 --> 00:47:00,334
Like your thoughts are
not separate from how you feel.

1124

Your thoughts...

1125
00:47:01,459 --> 00:47:03,834

in drag.

Women need therapy too.

1147

But usually when a woman
goes to therapy,

1148
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:05,584
it's because
a man in her life didn't.

1149
00:48:05,667 --> 00:48:10,792
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

1150
00:48:12,792 --> 00:48:16,167
I started going
four times a week.

1151
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:19,542
It's a program, it's called
psychoanalysis, and it's, uh...

1152
00:48:20,292 --> 00:48:21,500
The reason you go so often

1153
00:48:21,584 --> 00:48:23,375
is so that you don't have time
to close up.

1154
00:48:23,459 --> 00:48:26,167
Like, if you go once a week,
you have all week
to just close back up,

1155
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:27,918
so you stay open
throughout the week

1156
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,250
so you can access
parts of yourself

1157
00:48:29,334 --> 00:48:31,959
that are much harder
to access normally.

1158
00:48:32,042 --> 00:48:34,042
And so it's very emotional.
It's very exhausting.

1159
00:48:34,125 --> 00:48:37,292
It's very trying. I cry a lot.

1160
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:42,834
I sob-- The other day, I sobbed
for, like, 20 minutes straight.

1161
00:48:42,918 --> 00:48:45,375
And this is how fucked up I am.
As soon as I collected myself,

1162
00:48:45,459 --> 00:48:46,667
my first thought was,

1163
00:48:46,751 --> 00:48:48,792
"That shouldn't count
toward my time."

(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

1165
00:48:54,918 --> 00:48:57,000
But that's me trying to get out
of that moment.

1166
00:48:57,083 --> 00:48:59,792
Like that moment was
hard to swallow, and so...

1167
00:49:02,375 --> 00:49:04,834
joke, out, now we're out of it.

1168
00:49:04,918 --> 00:49:06,876
But I don't think
that's how progress gets made.

1169
00:49:06,959 --> 00:49:08,250
I think
if you wanna make progress,

1170
00:49:08,334 --> 00:49:10,042
you can't take that left turn
at a punchline.

1171
00:49:10,125 --> 00:49:11,292
You have to go...

1172
00:49:11,375 --> 00:49:13,709
You have to sit there
and process it there.

for sadness,

into a balloon animal for you

AUDIENCE: Why?

1204
00:51:05,375 --> 00:51:06,626
Because...

1205
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:09,334
he grew up...

1206
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:12,959
with an untreated
hearing loss...

1207
00:51:13,042 --> 00:51:16,417
which deprived him
of a major sensory connection

1208
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:19,209
to the people around him,
and it isolated him

1209
00:51:19,292 --> 00:51:21,792
to the point of chronic torture.
And his parents

1210
00:51:21,876 --> 00:51:25,167
were too caught up in their
own drama and insecurities

1211
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:27,209
to attend to it,
so he processed it

1212
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:29,751
as though there was something
inherently wrong with him.

1213
00:51:29,834 --> 00:51:32,000
And his feelings are a threat
to his relationships,

1214
00:51:32,083 --> 00:51:33,584
so he just suffered in silence,

1215
00:51:33,667 --> 00:51:36,000
feeling like he was
100 feet underwater,

1216
00:51:36,083 --> 00:51:38,250
wondering why nobody
was coming to save him.

1217
00:51:38,334 --> 00:51:40,459
And then, he finally started
wearing hearing aids,

1218
00:51:40,542 --> 00:51:42,042
which created
this insane sensation

1219
00:51:42,125 --> 00:51:43,626
of being able
to participate in a world

1220
00:51:43,709 --> 00:51:45,083
that he didn't understand.

1221
00:51:45,167 --> 00:51:47,083
But because his self-worth
was predicated

1222
00:51:47,167 --> 00:51:48,250
on how special he felt,

1223
00:51:48,334 --> 00:51:50,083
he realized
that the trodden path

1224
00:51:50,167 --> 00:51:51,250
didn't appeal to him.

1225
00:51:51,334 --> 00:51:53,250
So he would get high
and watch stand-up comedy

1226
00:51:53,334 --> 00:51:55,626
as a way to numb the agony
of how lost he felt.

1227
00:51:55,709 --> 00:51:57,459
And in doing so,
he found a lot of connection

1228
00:51:57,542 --> 00:51:59,834
with their points of view,
and he thought, "Wow,

1229
00:51:59,918 --> 00:52:02,834
if I could do that, people
could connect to me like that."

1230
00:52:02,918 --> 00:52:04,584
So he decided
to drop out of school

1231
00:52:04,667 --> 00:52:05,792
and pursue stand-up comedy,

1232
00:52:05,876 --> 00:52:07,918
and doing comedy made him
feel better for a moment,

1233
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,292
but it never forced him
to address any of the reasons

1234
00:52:10,375 --> 00:52:11,876
he actually felt like shit.

1235
00:52:11,959 --> 00:52:14,667
He so badly wanted
to feel special and powerful

1236
00:52:14,751 --> 00:52:16,209
to make up for
how worthless he felt,

1237
00:52:16,292 --> 00:52:18,209
so he would say all sorts
of fucked-up things,

1238
00:52:18,292 --> 00:52:21,000
onstage and off,
as a way to separate himself.

1239
00:52:21,083 --> 00:52:22,417
And a lot of it he stands by,

1240
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,125
but there are
a lot of things he said

1241
00:52:24,209 --> 00:52:25,584
that were flagrant
and unnecessary

1242
00:52:25,667 --> 00:52:26,792
and hurtful and racist

1243
00:52:26,876 --> 00:52:29,584
and sexist and homophobic,
all of which he justified

1244
00:52:29,667 --> 00:52:31,584
under the guise of
pushing the envelope,

1245
00:52:31,667 --> 00:52:33,918
which he thought was an act
of justified rebellion

1246
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,626
against some
arbitrary authority.

1247
00:52:35,709 --> 00:52:38,042
But too late, he learned
that a lot of those boundaries

1248
00:52:38,125 --> 00:52:41,042
are derived from real people's
feelings and experiences

1249
00:52:41,125 --> 00:52:43,292
and he was essentially
exploiting their actual pain

1250
00:52:43,375 --> 00:52:46,000
and using it as a traffic cone
to satisfy this story

1251
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:48,167
he was telling himself
where he was a genius.

1252
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:49,626
And just because people laugh
at something

1253
00:52:49,709 --> 00:52:51,292
doesn't inherently
make it good.

1254
00:52:51,375 --> 00:52:53,375
They could be just as
emotionally immature

1255
00:52:53,459 --> 00:52:55,125
or ignorant as
the perspective in the joke,

1256
00:52:55,209 --> 00:52:57,626
or they could be responding
to joke structure and timing

1257
00:52:57,709 --> 00:52:59,250
more than content.

1258
00:52:59,334 --> 00:53:00,584
And then, one day...

1259
00:53:00,667 --> 00:53:01,834
(MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING)

1260
00:53:01,918 --> 00:53:04,167
...all the world's stages
boarded up, so he sat alone

1261
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:05,959
in a room for a year,
and he did nothing

1262
00:53:06,042 --> 00:53:07,876
but talk to the walls
and a therapist.

1263
00:53:07,959 --> 00:53:09,709
And with no emotion
to escape into,

1264
00:53:09,792 --> 00:53:12,542
he slowly started breaking down
the paradigm he'd constructed

1265
00:53:12,626 --> 00:53:15,209
and moved into the feelings
he was running from.

1266
00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:17,167
And he discovered how badly
he had been hurting

1267
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:20,042
his entire life, and what it
actually is to hurt so badly.

1268
00:53:20,125 --> 00:53:21,876
And he realized
that there was not a single

1269
00:53:21,959 --> 00:53:24,500
period of his life
in which he was truly happy.

1270
00:53:24,584 --> 00:53:26,125
And through that,
he started to realize

1271
00:53:26,209 --> 00:53:27,876
how much pain
he had caused other people.

1272
00:53:27,959 --> 00:53:30,042
He instantly regretted
all the ways in which

1273
00:53:30,125 --> 00:53:31,876
he's needlessly made people
feel like shit

1274
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,542
in order to protect
his own conception

1275
00:53:33,626 --> 00:53:35,125
of himself as strong.

1276
00:53:35,209 --> 00:53:37,792
Then he wanted to disappear
from the world entirely

1277
00:53:37,876 --> 00:53:39,959
because he felt like
such an incredibly bad person

1278
00:53:40,042 --> 00:53:41,292
for having done these things.

1279
00:53:41,375 --> 00:53:43,542
So his instinct was
to beat himself up about it

1280
00:53:43,626 --> 00:53:45,459
and tell himself
what a horrible person he is,

1281
00:53:45,542 --> 00:53:47,334
but he's been shaming himself
his entire life,

1282
00:53:47,417 --> 00:53:48,876
and all these things he did
were just ways

1283
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:50,792
to push people away
and deprive himself

1284
00:53:50,876 --> 00:53:52,125
of any meaningful connection,

1285
00:53:52,209 --> 00:53:53,959
because of how badly
he felt about himself,

1286
00:53:54,042 --> 00:53:56,626
because it was too scary
and painful to be open enough

1287
00:53:56,709 --> 00:53:58,918
to connect to anyone else.
So, while he hurt people,

1288
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,584
he was hurting no one
more than himself,

1289
00:54:00,667 --> 00:54:02,209
and he doesn't want
to do that anymore.

1290
00:54:02,292 --> 00:54:04,000
He has worked so hard
to clear out space

1291
00:54:04,083 --> 00:54:06,500
within himself and feel safer
in his own body

1292
00:54:06,584 --> 00:54:08,584
and treat himself like
a friend he loves

1293
00:54:08,667 --> 00:54:10,167
as opposed to
an enemy he hates,

1294
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:12,667
which means he no longer
tolerates dynamics based on

1295
00:54:12,751 --> 00:54:14,584
his own self-destruction,
which has changed

1296
00:54:14,667 --> 00:54:16,167
numerous relationships
in his life,

1297
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:18,417
including the one with
the art form that he loves.

1298
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:20,751
The fear has always been
that if he makes peace

1299
00:54:20,834 --> 00:54:23,542
with the subterranean feelings
that drive all of this,

1300
00:54:23,626 --> 00:54:25,000
he'd lose this piece
of himself

1301
00:54:25,083 --> 00:54:27,417
which has helped him
survive and get to this point,

1302
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,042
a fear that he won't be
funny anymore,

1303
00:54:29,125 --> 00:54:31,292
he won't be special,
he'll just be,

1304
00:54:31,375 --> 00:54:32,834
which has been
an intolerable notion

1305
00:54:32,918 --> 00:54:34,667
because he doesn't feel
like enough on his own.

1306
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:37,000
He's only known
how to exist by chasing,

1307
00:54:37,083 --> 00:54:38,709
or thinking, or running,
or fighting,

1308
00:54:38,792 --> 00:54:41,209
or straining, or suffering,
or striving, or analyzing,

1309
00:54:41,292 --> 00:54:43,459
anxious energy
which ultimately manifests

1310
00:54:43,542 --> 00:54:45,792
the very same emptiness
it's borne out of.

1311
00:54:45,876 --> 00:54:48,167
And it keeps him locked
into one side of himself,

1312
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:50,083
but he's making every effort
to find a way

1313
00:54:50,167 --> 00:54:51,500
to not give in
to those anxieties

1314
00:54:51,584 --> 00:54:53,334
and sit with
the quiet inside of himself

1315
00:54:53,417 --> 00:54:57,584
because he wants so badly
to get to the other side.
