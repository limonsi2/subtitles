Our objective has always been

13
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:02,530
not to interfere with
activities on Earth.

14
00:01:02,564 --> 00:01:04,799
We should remain observers.

15
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:06,801
That is no longer acceptable.

16
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:08,870
They have captured
two of our crew

17
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,539
and we must now treat
them as hostile.

18
00:01:11,573 --> 00:01:13,575

that a flying disc
has been found

not to go out unless
absolutely necessary.

is no time to panic,

If there's a

72
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:44,652
then I'm open to it.

73
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:46,453
[McCaffrey] I think
we're past the point

74
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:49,090
of negotiations, Mr. President.

75
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:50,691
This is an election year.

76
00:04:50,725 --> 00:04:53,694
You need to take
a strong stance.

77
00:04:53,728 --> 00:04:56,463
[President] How many
human casualties so far?

78
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:59,432
[McCaffrey] Low hundreds,
very good figures.

79
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,434
[President] If
those figures rise,

80
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,303
we might need to
reconsider our position.

81
00:05:04,572 --> 00:05:06,841
[McCaffrey] Understood,
Mr. President.

82
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:08,743
[President] The lockdown
is concerning to me.

83
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:11,411
An economic crash
would be a disaster.

103
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:26,587
[Gweldor] We've lost so many.

104
00:06:26,621 --> 00:06:28,455
But I didn't come
here to lay waste

105
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,423
to a planet we helped build.

106
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:32,727
We came here to rescue our crew

107
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,629
and that's what we need to do.

108
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:38,666
You want to negotiate
with the humans?

109
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:42,770
[Gweldor] Yes, set the
ship down somewhere quiet.

110
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:44,972
Order the other
ships to pull back.

[mellow electronic music]

112
00:07:21,943 --> 00:07:23,844
I think you are
making a mistake.

113
00:07:23,878 --> 00:07:26,681
We are beyond the
point of negotiation.

114
00:07:26,714 --> 00:07:29,216
We should be focused
on securing victory.

115
00:07:30,384 --> 00:07:34,689
Our original mission was one
of retrieval and recovery.

116
00:07:34,722 --> 00:07:38,225
We need to return
to that objective.

120
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:47,635
Who am I speaking with?

121
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:49,203
My name is Magon,

122
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:51,706
and I represent
Gweldor, the leader

123
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:54,709
of a group from the Zeta
Reticuli star system.

124
00:07:54,742 --> 00:07:55,910
I have a proposal.

125
00:07:57,078 --> 00:07:58,245
[Romney] Go ahead.

126
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:00,081
If you allow us to
return to our retrieve

127
00:08:00,114 --> 00:08:03,751
and recovery mission
without further hostility,

128
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:05,519
our ships will stand down.

129
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,589
There will be no
further loss of life.

130
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:09,690
[Romney] Our boys are giving you

131
00:08:09,724 --> 00:08:12,860
a goddam ass-kicking out there.

132
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:15,763
You're in no position
to be dictating terms.

133
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:18,232
With all due respect, General,

134
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:20,101
you have overseen
a significant loss

135
00:08:20,134 --> 00:08:22,703
of human life during
this conflict.

136
00:08:22,737 --> 00:08:25,006
Do you really want more
blood on your hands?

137
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,075
[Romney] We do not
negotiate with terrorists,

138
00:08:28,109 --> 00:08:31,612
domestic, international,
or intergalactic.

139
00:08:33,014 --> 00:08:35,516
[tense music]

140
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,896
So General, I understand
that the aliens

141
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:52,666
have expressed an
interest in a ceasefire.

142
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,701
Yes, sir.

143
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:57,638
They hadn't threatened
any further hostilities.

144
00:08:57,671 --> 00:09:00,574
In fact, several of their
ships stood down after that.

145
00:09:01,609 --> 00:09:03,177
We've disengaged.

146
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:07,114
Whether that's temporary
or not, I don't know.

147
00:09:07,148 --> 00:09:09,250
That is temporary.

148
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:12,586
We need to show force
in this situation.

149
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,755
[tense music]

150
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:17,591
Collins, how many
of their numbers

151
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,261
do we have alive in Area 51?

152
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:21,929
Well, there were
two ETs on the craft

153
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:24,098
which we recently
recovered, sir.

154
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:26,233
They're currently in
our research facility.

155
00:09:26,267 --> 00:09:28,669
Have they shown hostility?

156
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:31,005
They were injured, sir, so no.

157
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:33,741
They're pretty docile
and in recovery.

158
00:09:34,442 --> 00:09:37,778
Sir, the ET I spoke
with indicated

159
00:09:37,812 --> 00:09:40,648
that if they could retrieve
their two comrades,

160
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:43,651
they'd leave the
planet in peace.

161
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:46,253
Oh, it is beyond that.

162
00:09:46,287 --> 00:09:49,356
We need to resume combat

163
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:52,827
until they are obliterated.

164
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,796
Is that understood?

165
00:09:56,897 --> 00:09:59,633
Yes, sir, it's understood.

166
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:04,705

[Pilot] We got wings inbound.

169

[Pilot] Copy.

170
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:22,990
I'm on him.

on the offensive again.

[Gweldor] We have no choice
but to defend ourselves.

[tense music]

178
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:01,862
[Magon] Are you sure you
want to do this, sir?

179
00:11:01,896 --> 00:11:03,998
Force seems to be the only thing

180
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:06,033
these humans understand.

181
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:08,903
It's kill or be killed.

[Magon] Human craft
in range, sir.

[suspenseful music]

188
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,065
[Gweldor] Fire!

189
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,070
[rocket whooshes and explodes]

190
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,440
[static on radio]

191
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:50,177
All enemy crafts obliterated.

192
00:11:50,211 --> 00:11:53,214
Repeat, all enemy
crafts obliterated.

193
00:11:53,247 --> 00:11:55,816
[somber music]

194
00:11:57,985 --> 00:11:58,919
Mr. Collins.

195
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,289
This is Chief Master
Sergeant Maitland.

196
00:12:02,323 --> 00:12:03,891
It's good to speak to you.

197
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:04,892
All right.

198
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:07,294
Let me bring you up to
speed on where we're at.

199
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:11,865
Now, the Air Force under the
command of General Romney

200
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:14,201
are leading the offensive
here on the ground.

201
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:16,070
They've engaged with
several alien craft

202
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:18,038
but so far, their
efforts have been...

203
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:21,976
Less than ideal.

204
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:26,180
A few weeks ago, two of
our astronauts discovered

205
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:28,916
an alien ship near a
lunar impact crater

206
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:31,151
known as the Aitken Basin.

207
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:33,954
They attempted to make
contact with our new friends,

208
00:12:33,988 --> 00:12:36,558
but there was no one home.

209
00:12:36,591 --> 00:12:39,860
They did, however, manage to
tap into their ship's frequency

210
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:42,296
and we've since been able to
monitor their communications.

211
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:45,099
Now, that ship is the same one

212
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:47,334
that crashed in
the Nevada Desert.

213
00:12:48,603 --> 00:12:51,805
[alien ship whooshing]

214
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:56,343
[alien ship exploding]

215
00:12:57,878 --> 00:12:59,514
Now we're being
instructed by McCaffrey

216
00:12:59,547 --> 00:13:01,549
to hold press briefings saying

217
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,217
that they came here
as the aggressors,

218
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,451
and that's not the truth.

219
00:13:04,485 --> 00:13:06,353
We've got the ship's
logs to prove it.

220
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:10,891
They were here on a rescue
and recovery mission.

221
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:13,060
And I reported all
this to the Air Force

222
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:13,994
but they didn't listen.

223
00:13:14,028 --> 00:13:15,296
They just shot them down.

224
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:18,832
We were the aggressors.

225
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:26,907
Of course, now we have
to tow the party line

226
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,375
and honor McCaffrey's wishes,

227
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:30,944
but you see, I'm a tad
confused about that.

228
00:13:32,514 --> 00:13:34,281
Why are we now taking
orders from someone

229
00:13:34,315 --> 00:13:36,383
who seems to have come
in out of nowhere?

230
00:13:37,652 --> 00:13:40,954
I mean, is he even officially
a part of this administration?

231
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:42,923
But why is he the
one calling the shots

232
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:45,893
on behalf of the President
of the United States?

233
00:13:49,263 --> 00:13:50,164
Strange situation.

234
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,935
Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Collins?

235
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:05,179
[Petra on TV] The Bible
makes no mention

236
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:08,015
of extraterrestrial life.

237
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:11,352
In fact, any discussion
of it is forbidden.

238
00:14:11,385 --> 00:14:13,287
With all due respect,

239
00:14:14,656 --> 00:14:16,890
the Bible was written at a time

240
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:21,161
when religious leaders
were also the lawmakers.

241
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:27,267
Lawmakers want
subservient citizens,

242
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:30,904
and the easiest way
to propagate that,

243
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:36,877
by having humans focus on
everyday concerns and fears.

244
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:39,547
The saddest thing is,

245
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:44,017
many people buy into the idea,

246
00:14:47,421 --> 00:14:50,224
only intelligent life
that exists out there.

247
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:55,663
Considering the size
of the universe,

248
00:14:57,965 --> 00:15:02,236
in effect, we don't have
technology to take us

249
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:04,938
far beyond our own
little corner of it.

250
00:15:06,674 --> 00:15:11,011
It seems rather arrogant
of us to believe that.

251
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:12,379
[somber music]

252
00:15:12,413 --> 00:15:14,014
[Petra] I've noticed
people have started

253
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:15,650
to turn on each other.

254
00:15:15,683 --> 00:15:18,118
Some are even still in denial.

255
00:15:18,152 --> 00:15:21,121
As humans, we are
programmed to conform

256
00:15:21,155 --> 00:15:25,959
to a certain way of
thinking and being,

257
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:31,098
therefore, we fear anything
that's different or unusual.

258
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:36,236
And it's that fear that
keeps us from accepting

259
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:39,541
the fact that,
scientifically speaking,

260
00:15:41,175 --> 00:15:43,177
it's perfectly plausible

261
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:47,448
that other intelligent
life exists out there.

262
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:53,420
The media, oh, don't get
me started about the media.

263
00:15:56,558 --> 00:15:59,393
The media publishes information

264
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:03,030
about UFO sightings
when it's exciting,

265
00:16:04,599 --> 00:16:09,604
but always in a
mocking, whimsical tone,

266
00:16:11,739 --> 00:16:16,744
reassuring the public that
this can't possibly be true.

267
00:16:17,645 --> 00:16:19,146
[Petra] Is that what
happened at Roswell?

268
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,014
I believe so.

269
00:16:23,618 --> 00:16:26,053
The initial reports
seemed authentic,

270
00:16:27,822 --> 00:16:30,123
[indistinct] how
witness accounts to it,

271
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:33,026
valid photographic evidence.

272
00:16:36,598 --> 00:16:38,298
When the authorities stepped in,

273
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,636
everything changed.

274
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:47,542
The witnesses were discredited.

275
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:54,014
Official line became it was
some kinda weather experiment.

276
00:16:54,983 --> 00:16:56,383
[Petra] You don't
believe it was?

277
00:16:58,452 --> 00:17:03,123
But now, they have no choice
to acknowledge the fact

278
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:07,729
of what we have seen
with our own eyes.

279
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:12,567
Everything's changed now.

280
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:19,406
We'll emerge from this
into a totally new world,

281
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:27,214
potentially, an entirely new
collective consciousness.

282
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:29,617
[somber music]

283
00:17:32,754 --> 00:17:35,623
[Gweldor] The military
are resisting negotiation.

284
00:17:35,657 --> 00:17:38,526
We need to speak to
another government agency.

285
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,095
[Magon] What other agency
would be receptive?

286
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:44,231
[Gweldor] NASA and
the Space Force

287
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:48,101
are responsible for the
civilian space program.

288
00:17:48,135 --> 00:17:50,672
[Magon] Should we conduct
a reconnaissance mission?

289
00:17:50,705 --> 00:17:54,241
Yes, they have a base
in the Nevada Desert.

290
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:57,579
Send Elon and Elgor,
then report back to me.

291
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:00,515
[Magon] Yes, sir.

292
00:18:00,548 --> 00:18:03,383
[machine beeping]

293
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:10,658
[Elgor] Elon, you will
accompany me to the desert base.

294
00:18:10,692 --> 00:18:13,861
We have been asked to
undertake a peaceful mission.

295
00:18:13,895 --> 00:18:16,430
But in war time, we
need to show our enemies

296
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:18,265
how formidable we are.

297
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,104

[Hologram] Greetings, Gweldor.

305
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:24,525
Regretfully, I have bad news.

306
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,861
[Gweldor] What is it?

307
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:29,797
[Hologram] Elgor
and Elon are dead.

308
00:20:29,831 --> 00:20:32,567
[Gweldor] What happened?

309
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,502
[Hologram] During their
reconnaissance mission,

310
00:20:34,535 --> 00:20:38,806
Elgor and Elon confronted
one of the earthlings.

311
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,909
They fought valiantly but
the human took their weapon.

312
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:46,581
Elgor and Elon were
stabbed to death.

313
00:20:46,614 --> 00:20:50,283
That's enough, we
can't go on like this.

314
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:52,754
[ominous music]

315
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:04,364
Morning, sir, I've been
asked to brief you.

316
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:07,034
That's correct.

317
00:21:07,068 --> 00:21:10,370
As I'm sure you're aware,
enemy hostility has escalated.

318
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:12,907
There was an incident
at our desert base.

319
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,610
Two little bastards broke in
and attacked our personnel.

320
00:21:15,643 --> 00:21:18,713
The situation is now
under control, but sir,

321
00:21:18,746 --> 00:21:21,983
they had some kind of a
bladed energy weapon on them.

322
00:21:22,016 --> 00:21:23,350
It was made out of
some kind of material

323
00:21:23,383 --> 00:21:25,787
our scientists, they'd
never seen before.

324
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,354
We shipped the bodies,
along with the weapon,

325
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:29,690
back to Area 51 for
further analysis.

326
00:21:29,724 --> 00:21:33,393
Sir, I think it's clear that
their motive was revenge.

327
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:35,495
You and I both know that
their original intent

328
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:37,464
was never to attack,
but now the Air Force

329
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:39,000
has shot down so
many of their craft,

330
00:21:39,033 --> 00:21:41,969
they are hell bent to attack
us on all possible fronts.

331
00:21:42,003 --> 00:21:43,738
I mean, every department
is under threat,

332
00:21:43,771 --> 00:21:48,341
and yet this administration is
determined not to negotiate.

333
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:49,544
I know that.

334
00:21:49,577 --> 00:21:50,711
Well, all right then.

335
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:54,081
Surely we can do something to,

336
00:21:54,115 --> 00:21:56,851
to find a peaceful solution,

337
00:21:56,884 --> 00:21:59,754
to cease hostilities before
we lose any more lives.

[Pilot] Copy that, weapons hot.

341
00:22:09,396 --> 00:22:09,964
[Correspondent] I copy.

342
00:22:09,997 --> 00:22:10,932
[Pilot] I'm going in.

343
00:22:10,965 --> 00:22:14,434
[Correspondent] Affirmative.

344
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:17,104
[Gweldor] Humans are
preparing another airstrike.

345
00:22:18,773 --> 00:22:20,842
One of our crafts is isolated.

346
00:22:23,578 --> 00:22:25,445
Contact the other ships.

347
00:22:25,478 --> 00:22:28,448
Coordinates zero,
five, nine, four.

348
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:30,585

why would they come
to this country?

357
00:23:25,706 --> 00:23:27,108
Why America?

358
00:23:28,175 --> 00:23:32,880
Read a book recently,
explaining how the night sky

359
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:38,819
played an important role in
early Native American cultures.

360
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:45,793
Studying the stars,
tribes would theorize

361
00:23:45,826 --> 00:23:48,162
about the meaning of life,

362
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:52,566
the universe, and the afterlife.

363
00:23:54,835 --> 00:23:58,172
The Cheyenne Indians
of the Northern Plains

364
00:24:00,641 --> 00:24:02,877
believed the souls of the dead

365
00:24:04,011 --> 00:24:06,614
traveled along the Milky Way.

366
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:12,520
The Road of the
Departed, they called it.

367
00:24:13,854 --> 00:24:17,091
The spirits of the
dead followed a path

368
00:24:21,295 --> 00:24:25,066
where the footsteps all
pointed the same way,

369
00:24:28,169 --> 00:24:29,537
to the Milky Way,

370
00:24:33,641 --> 00:24:36,177
and it camped in the stars,

371
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:38,579
where they reunited
with all the friends

372
00:24:38,612 --> 00:24:41,682
and family they lost.

373
00:24:41,716 --> 00:24:46,520
Maybe that's why these
extraterrestrials
have come here.

374
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:55,997
Our indigenous
population always did say

375
00:24:57,631 --> 00:24:59,700
that the answers
to life and death

376
00:25:01,002 --> 00:25:02,269
could be found up there.

377
00:25:12,747 --> 00:25:15,683
The extraterrestrial
mentioned Zeta Reticuli?

378
00:25:15,716 --> 00:25:17,151
That's correct.

379
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:18,652
I actually have an
interesting article

380
00:25:18,686 --> 00:25:20,021
that relates to that.

381
00:25:20,054 --> 00:25:21,322
Which is?

382
00:25:21,355 --> 00:25:24,859
Have you ever heard of
Barney and Betty Hill?

383
00:25:24,892 --> 00:25:26,660
Can't say that I have.

384
00:25:26,694 --> 00:25:28,562
They were a married
couple who claimed

385
00:25:28,596 --> 00:25:30,598
to have been abducted
by extraterrestrials

386
00:25:30,631 --> 00:25:33,634
in New Hampshire in 1961.

387
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:36,771
It was the first widely
publicized account

388
00:25:36,804 --> 00:25:39,340
of an abduction in
the United States.

389
00:25:39,373 --> 00:25:41,876
It came to be called the
Zeta Reticuli incident

390
00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:45,679
because they claimed the
aliens who abducted them

391
00:25:45,713 --> 00:25:47,982
came from that Solar System.

392
00:25:48,015 --> 00:25:48,883
Interesting.

393
00:25:50,117 --> 00:25:51,986
They went to a
hypnotherapist in an attempt

394
00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:54,855
to try to recall some of the
memories of their abduction.

395
00:25:56,223 --> 00:25:58,626
An interesting thing
emerged from the sessions.

396
00:25:59,627 --> 00:26:02,630
Betty drew a star map, which
contravened the traditional map

397
00:26:02,663 --> 00:26:05,633
that astronomers had
grown accustomed to.

398
00:26:05,666 --> 00:26:06,867
Do we have access to that?

399
00:26:08,369 --> 00:26:09,837
I dug into the
archives this morning,

400
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,605
and I have it in front of me.

401
00:26:11,639 --> 00:26:12,807
What does it tell you?

402
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:16,811
My colleague, Atterberg,
proposed that the base stars

403
00:26:16,844 --> 00:26:19,914
are Epsilon Indi
and Epsilon Eridani,

404
00:26:21,082 --> 00:26:22,249
both of which are
near the lower limit

405
00:26:22,283 --> 00:26:23,818
of life-bearing planets,

406
00:26:23,851 --> 00:26:26,153
at least according to
most exobiologists.

407
00:26:28,189 --> 00:26:29,223
I don't concur.

408
00:26:30,825 --> 00:26:34,762
Neither one is as suitable
as Zeta 1 and Zeta 2.

409
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:41,669
Zeta Reticuli is a
unique star system

410
00:26:41,702 --> 00:26:43,604
in the solar neighborhood,

411
00:26:44,305 --> 00:26:46,807
almost identical to our Sun,

412
00:26:46,841 --> 00:26:49,110
just 39 light-years from Earth.

413
00:26:50,845 --> 00:26:53,614
So, what's the conclusion?

414
00:26:54,949 --> 00:26:59,954
This map is from the
perspective of Zeta Reticuli,

415
00:27:00,754 --> 00:27:01,822
not Earth.

416
00:27:01,856 --> 00:27:03,958
[tense music]

417
00:27:03,991 --> 00:27:06,026
[Reporter] White House
spokesman Clarence Bodicker

418
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,395
today held a press
conference to allay fears

419
00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:10,030
the Air Force is
losing the battle

420
00:27:10,064 --> 00:27:12,032
with the extraterrestrials.

421
00:27:12,066 --> 00:27:14,034
Mr. Bodicker informed reporters

422
00:27:14,068 --> 00:27:16,737
that the military have
the situation in control

423
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:18,672
and have landed
significant airstrikes

424
00:27:18,706 --> 00:27:20,441
on several alien crafts.

425
00:27:20,474 --> 00:27:23,777
He described the aliens as
unjustifiably aggressive

426
00:27:23,811 --> 00:27:25,946
and a very real
threat to humanity.

427
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,382
Mr. Bodicker stressed
that while the military

428
00:27:28,415 --> 00:27:30,985
are in control, all
citizens of Nevada

429
00:27:31,018 --> 00:27:33,354
and surrounding States
must remain in their homes

430
00:27:33,387 --> 00:27:35,289
until the situation is resolved.

431
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:48,802
[keyboard clicking]

432
00:27:57,811 --> 00:27:58,812
Dan?

433
00:27:59,914 --> 00:28:00,981
Hey, Maggie.

434
00:28:01,015 --> 00:28:03,951
Hi, I've been watching the news.

435
00:28:07,054 --> 00:28:09,823
Maybe you shouldn't.

436
00:28:09,857 --> 00:28:10,758
You okay?

437
00:28:11,458 --> 00:28:13,027
Yeah, I am fine.

438
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,763
It's just starting to
get a little crazy here.

439
00:28:16,764 --> 00:28:18,098
I'm worried about you.

440
00:28:19,466 --> 00:28:21,168
Don't be, it's going to be okay.

441
00:28:23,771 --> 00:28:25,739
There's footage of
all those crafts

442
00:28:25,773 --> 00:28:28,442
all over the Internet, and
I knew this day would come,

443
00:28:28,475 --> 00:28:31,845
but now it's here, it's surreal.

444
00:28:31,879 --> 00:28:33,814
I know, I understand,

445
00:28:33,847 --> 00:28:38,085
but this is why I signed
up in the first place,

446
00:28:38,118 --> 00:28:39,486
you know, to be on the frontline

447
00:28:39,521 --> 00:28:41,455
during a key moment of history.

448
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:44,858
[mellow piano music]

449
00:28:44,892 --> 00:28:46,193
Just be careful.

450
00:28:48,062 --> 00:28:50,764
Remember there's someone
here who loves you very much.

451
00:28:53,067 --> 00:28:53,968
I love you, too.

452
00:28:54,868 --> 00:28:57,972
[mellow piano music]

453
00:29:00,975 --> 00:29:03,511
[Magon] We're losing
too many of our crew.

454
00:29:03,545 --> 00:29:05,846
Our numbers are
severely depleted.

[somber music]

456
00:29:07,448 --> 00:29:09,950
Now is not the
time to pull back.

457
00:29:09,984 --> 00:29:12,520
We need to remain
on the offensive.

458
00:29:12,554 --> 00:29:15,956
I know you want a
diplomatic solution, sir.

459
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:18,192
That could still be possible.

460
00:29:18,225 --> 00:29:21,362
No, that is simply not
acceptable at this stage.

461
00:29:21,395 --> 00:29:22,763
We need to show more force.

00:29:40,881 --> 00:29:43,984
Hey, mom, how is it going?

465
00:29:44,018 --> 00:29:44,852
Oh!

466
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:50,024
As well as can be expected
when you're under house arrest.

467
00:29:50,057 --> 00:29:52,993
In fairness, there's a
pretty good reason for it.

468
00:29:53,027 --> 00:29:54,928
I suppose.

469
00:29:54,962 --> 00:29:58,132
Anyway, how are you?

470
00:29:58,165 --> 00:29:58,999
Not bad.

471
00:30:00,535 --> 00:30:01,368
How's dad?

472
00:30:02,637 --> 00:30:03,538
Bonkers as ever.

473
00:30:04,639 --> 00:30:06,940
He's in the bedroom right now

474
00:30:06,974 --> 00:30:10,144
reading some fishing
magazine and laughing.

475
00:30:10,177 --> 00:30:13,881
I have no idea what he
finds so funny about it,

476
00:30:13,914 --> 00:30:17,217
but have fun, there we go.

You've got to love his quirk.

Have you...heard from Danny?

479
00:30:24,091 --> 00:30:26,827
It would be nice if he
could get a normal job.

480
00:30:29,196 --> 00:30:31,031
He loves his job.

481
00:30:31,065 --> 00:30:33,267
I mean, we have a pretty
good life because of it.

482
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,936
But is it really
worth all the worry?

483
00:30:37,572 --> 00:30:38,372
Come on, mom.

484
00:30:39,674 --> 00:30:41,842
I do worry, but let's
not make it worse.

485
00:30:43,477 --> 00:30:45,045
Okay.

486
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:45,879
Sorry.

487
00:30:46,947 --> 00:30:49,016
It's fine.

488
00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:50,217
You know, love,

489
00:30:51,653 --> 00:30:54,888
it's so hard that we can't
be together in person

490
00:30:54,922 --> 00:30:56,190
during all of this.

491
00:30:58,058 --> 00:31:00,994
I just want to
give you a big hug.

492
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:05,499
This video chatting helps, but

493
00:31:05,533 --> 00:31:08,102
it really isn't any
kind of substitute.

494
00:31:11,004 --> 00:31:11,606
I know.

495
00:31:19,213 --> 00:31:21,048
I want to divert our course.

496
00:31:21,081 --> 00:31:22,916
We need to go to Egypt.

497
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:25,052
Forgive me for asking, sir,

498
00:31:25,085 --> 00:31:28,288
but what would be our
mission in that region?

499
00:31:28,322 --> 00:31:32,025
The pyramids are a
spiritual hub for humanity.

500
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:33,961
Perhaps we can use their power

501
00:31:33,994 --> 00:31:35,530
to gain insight into the future.

502
00:31:37,665 --> 00:31:39,701
Thank you for speaking
with me, General.

503
00:31:39,734 --> 00:31:40,602
Not a problem.

504
00:31:40,635 --> 00:31:43,237
What can I do for ya?

505
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:47,341
Well, sir, believe me, I
understand the chain of command

506
00:31:47,374 --> 00:31:50,043
and know that if we don't
follow it, lives are lost.

507
00:31:51,078 --> 00:31:53,080
But in this particular scenario,

508
00:31:53,113 --> 00:31:55,482
I feel we need to be on
the right side of history.

509
00:31:55,517 --> 00:31:57,084
And you don't feel we are?

510
00:31:57,985 --> 00:31:59,319
Not really, sir, no.

511
00:31:59,353 --> 00:32:01,121
The aliens have
indicated several times

512
00:32:01,155 --> 00:32:03,625
that they're prepared
to cease hostilities.

513
00:32:03,658 --> 00:32:06,160
Yet, McCaffrey is
pushing us further

514
00:32:06,193 --> 00:32:08,395
and further into conflict.

515
00:32:08,429 --> 00:32:09,997
I'll level with you, Collins.

516
00:32:10,998 --> 00:32:14,134
I don't like McCaffrey
any more than you do.

517
00:32:14,168 --> 00:32:17,137
He's a ball-busting prick.

518
00:32:17,171 --> 00:32:18,972
Circumventing the
chain of command

519
00:32:19,006 --> 00:32:21,041
isn't going to do me any favors.

520
00:32:21,975 --> 00:32:23,177
But you're the General
of the Air Force.

521
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:26,447
You have every right to speak
with the President directly.

522
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,182
You don't need to go
through McCaffrey.

523
00:32:28,215 --> 00:32:29,751
I know that.

524
00:32:29,784 --> 00:32:31,586
Well, then why don't you?

525
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:33,353
You think the
President will have

526
00:32:33,387 --> 00:32:35,989
a different stance
than McCaffrey?

527
00:32:36,023 --> 00:32:37,491
I don't know.

528
00:32:37,525 --> 00:32:41,094
But the aliens are interested
in a diplomatic resolution.

529
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:44,231
Okay, McCaffrey is determined
not to give them that,

530
00:32:44,264 --> 00:32:47,167
but maybe the President
will be more receptive.

531
00:32:47,201 --> 00:32:49,604
Look, I just think it's worth it

532
00:32:49,637 --> 00:32:52,039
to try and appeal to
his better nature.

533
00:32:52,072 --> 00:32:54,141
I know, given the President's
respect for your war record,

534
00:32:54,174 --> 00:32:55,643
you're the right man to do it.

535
00:32:57,044 --> 00:32:59,279
I appreciate your
confidence, Collins.

536
00:33:00,447 --> 00:33:02,449
I've always been
proud of my record,

537
00:33:03,785 --> 00:33:06,186
but it has come with a cost.

538
00:33:07,187 --> 00:33:09,289
I have a history of PTSD.

539
00:33:10,725 --> 00:33:13,360
Truth be told, Collins,
they've been trying

540
00:33:13,393 --> 00:33:15,563
to put me out to
pasture for a while.

541
00:33:17,565 --> 00:33:19,567
But I'm not ready to retire.

542
00:33:19,601 --> 00:33:22,436
That'd be like admitting defeat,

543
00:33:22,469 --> 00:33:25,038
letting my personal
demons beat me.

544
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,142
Well, I'm not too keen
about putting a blot

545
00:33:29,176 --> 00:33:32,212
on my copy book
with the President,

546
00:33:32,246 --> 00:33:35,517
and giving folks an
excuse to set me aside.

547
00:33:36,518 --> 00:33:38,018
It is what it is.

548
00:33:39,219 --> 00:33:42,557
But I don't need any
further stress here.

549
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:45,092
I just want to do my job.

550
00:33:48,095 --> 00:33:49,564
Look, maybe we'll win this war.

551
00:33:50,632 --> 00:33:52,099
But at what cost?

552
00:33:52,967 --> 00:33:55,402
Do we want the entire nation
living with the same trauma

553
00:33:55,435 --> 00:33:57,505
that you've had to
contend with for years?

554
00:33:59,373 --> 00:34:02,175
What kind of nation are we
even going to be left with?

555
00:34:08,683 --> 00:34:11,151
It's been widely
discussed on social media

556
00:34:11,184 --> 00:34:15,088
that an alien craft has
been spotted over Egypt.

557
00:34:15,122 --> 00:34:17,859
According to our intelligence,
it's the mothership.

558
00:34:17,892 --> 00:34:19,293
They're headed towards Giza.

559
00:34:21,896 --> 00:34:25,465

Pyramids of Giza,

00:34:29,236 --> 00:34:32,774

Considering they originated

564
00:34:43,751 --> 00:34:48,523
sometime between 2580, 2560 BC,

565
00:34:52,694 --> 00:34:56,598
archeologists and
historians are puzzled

566
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:01,569
at just how these huge
structures were built.

567
00:35:04,572 --> 00:35:09,577
One theory is they may
have had alien assistance,

568
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,218
using advanced technology
to create them.

569
00:35:21,856 --> 00:35:25,392
Pharaoh Akhenaten's
strange appearance

570
00:35:27,194 --> 00:35:32,199
caused skepticism among
ancient alien theorists,

571
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:38,606
believing he may have
been an extraterrestrial.

Is there anything I can do
to stop this destruction?

574
00:36:28,321 --> 00:36:31,291
No, the humans must
save themselves.

everything right now.

Yeah.

[President] All we've
heard from the enemy

621
00:40:02,003 --> 00:40:04,538
is bombastic rhetoric
and a replaying

622
00:40:04,572 --> 00:40:06,674
of the demands for negotiation.

[Romney] Precisely, sir.

There's an avenue
open for peace talks.

00:40:12,113 --> 00:40:14,582
[President] But Romney,
this is an election year.

626
00:40:14,615 --> 00:40:15,983
We've lost a lot of lives.

never forgive me.

[Romney] On the contrary, sir,

I believe the people
would appreciate

00:40:24,558 --> 00:40:26,594

632
00:40:26,627 --> 00:40:29,563
end this lockdown sooner.

633

[President] It's
interesting, Romney.

634
00:40:30,798 --> 00:40:32,499
You've spent decades straddling

635
00:40:32,533 --> 00:40:35,503
the world of the
military and politics,

636
00:40:35,536 --> 00:40:38,539
but you still don't
understand the political side.

What do you mean, sir?

00:40:41,008 --> 00:40:42,643
[President] The
average hardworking Joe

639
00:40:42,677 --> 00:40:44,545
doesn't want to risk
his life in a war

640
00:40:44,578 --> 00:40:45,780
when the best he
can get out of it

641
00:40:45,813 --> 00:40:47,748
is to come back to
his home in one piece.

642
00:40:47,782 --> 00:40:49,050
Relatives don't want to worry

643
00:40:49,083 --> 00:40:50,785
about their loved
ones dying either.

644
00:40:50,818 --> 00:40:53,521
But it is he leader
of the country

645
00:40:53,554 --> 00:40:55,122
who determines the policy,

646
00:40:55,156 --> 00:40:58,626
and even in a democracy,
voice or no voice,

647
00:40:58,659 --> 00:40:59,961
the people can always be brought

648
00:40:59,994 --> 00:41:01,629
to the bidding of leader.

649
00:41:01,662 --> 00:41:02,730
All you have to do is tell them

650
00:41:02,763 --> 00:41:04,198
that they are being attacked,

651
00:41:04,231 --> 00:41:06,634
and denounce the pacifists
for lack of patriotism

652
00:41:06,667 --> 00:41:08,669
and exposing the
country to danger.

653
00:41:08,703 --> 00:41:11,205
It works the same
way in any country.

654
00:41:11,238 --> 00:41:12,940
That's what we need now.

655
00:41:12,974 --> 00:41:15,276
We need to galvanize the
people into patriotism

656
00:41:15,309 --> 00:41:17,778
as we mop the floor
with these aliens.

657
00:41:17,812 --> 00:41:20,480
We need to be strong in
this moment, not retreat.

658
00:41:21,983 --> 00:41:24,051
All I need from you
is to help us win.

659
00:41:24,085 --> 00:41:25,019
Understood?

00:41:26,587 --> 00:41:27,521
Yes, sir.

00:41:33,027 --> 00:41:34,829
I haven't thought
about in years.

663
00:41:38,632 --> 00:41:43,204
When I was a kid,
my family and I

664
00:41:43,237 --> 00:41:44,638
visited relatives in Arizona.

665
00:41:47,641 --> 00:41:50,678
A Navajo man, he told me a story

666
00:41:53,047 --> 00:41:55,549
about this calf
in a nearby farm.

667
00:41:57,051 --> 00:41:59,020
He was born prematurely.

668
00:42:00,688 --> 00:42:05,659
He was so weak everyone
thought it wouldn't survive.

669
00:42:06,394 --> 00:42:10,798
But his mother, she
kept on giving him milk,

670
00:42:11,799 --> 00:42:13,667
kept on keeping it warm.

671
00:42:15,636 --> 00:42:20,608
She was determined that her
offspring would survive.

672
00:42:21,242 --> 00:42:22,877
A few weeks later,

673
00:42:24,311 --> 00:42:27,281
the calf was strong
and full of life.

674
00:42:28,949 --> 00:42:32,853
But it wouldn't take its
mother's milk no more.

675
00:42:32,887 --> 00:42:37,892
A couple of days later,
the mother cow, she died.

676
00:42:40,861 --> 00:42:43,998

677
00:42:45,332 --> 00:42:47,301
in order for something to live,

678
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:51,739

must be sacrificed.

According to reports from
our intelligence agencies,

the aliens have several androids
aboard their mothership.

687

McCaffrey wants our model
to infiltrate the craft.

He feels doing so via
artificial intelligence

689
00:43:31,779 --> 00:43:33,280
can yield better results

690
00:43:33,314 --> 00:43:35,916
than attempting to
negotiate with the aliens.

691

just not being disclosed

to assist with that process?

to become hostile,

713
00:44:32,273 --> 00:44:33,807
we will treat you accordingly.

[android blasting]

715
00:44:47,054 --> 00:44:48,856
[Hagor] He's self-destructing.

00:44:48,889 --> 00:44:51,825
[android blasting]

717
00:45:06,774 --> 00:45:08,309
Good morning, General.

718
00:45:10,911 --> 00:45:11,745
Morning.

719
00:45:12,947 --> 00:45:15,049
My dearly four years
and then McCaffrey.

720
00:45:15,082 --> 00:45:16,784
We are both busy men,

721
00:45:16,817 --> 00:45:20,154
so I will get
straight to the point.

722
00:45:20,187 --> 00:45:22,823
I understand that you
spoke to the President.

723
00:45:23,958 --> 00:45:26,360
As it is my right to do.

724
00:45:26,393 --> 00:45:29,396
I'm not questioning your
right to speak to him.

725
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:33,901
My concern is the topic
of that discussion.

726
00:45:33,934 --> 00:45:36,303
I understand that
you encouraged him

727
00:45:36,337 --> 00:45:39,773
to authorize a stand
down of troops?

728
00:45:39,807 --> 00:45:43,010
I believe there's
room for negotiations.

729
00:45:43,043 --> 00:45:47,014
That directly contravenes
United States policy.

730
00:45:47,047 --> 00:45:50,518
This situation has cost
too many lives already,

731
00:45:50,552 --> 00:45:52,886
not just in combat.

732
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,089
Think of the health
effects on the civilians

733
00:45:55,122 --> 00:45:57,891
as they stayed locked
down in their homes.

734
00:45:57,925 --> 00:46:02,363
I never had you down as being
such a humanitarian, Romney.

735
00:46:02,396 --> 00:46:05,399
With all due respect, McCaffrey,

736
00:46:05,432 --> 00:46:07,201
don't condescend to me.

737
00:46:08,369 --> 00:46:10,804
Fact is, Romney,
I am now above you

738
00:46:10,838 --> 00:46:12,239
in the chain of command,

739
00:46:12,273 --> 00:46:14,275
and if you ever
break that again,

740
00:46:14,308 --> 00:46:17,945
I will make sure that
not only are you fired,

741
00:46:17,978 --> 00:46:20,814
but that you are
brought up on charges.

742
00:46:20,848 --> 00:46:22,249
Charges?

743
00:46:22,283 --> 00:46:23,984
For what?

744
00:46:24,018 --> 00:46:27,187
Oh, I will think of something.

745
00:46:27,221 --> 00:46:29,923
Maybe we'll find some
interesting photos

746
00:46:29,957 --> 00:46:33,260
and videos on your
home computer.

747
00:46:33,294 --> 00:46:35,095
Who knows?

748
00:46:35,129 --> 00:46:38,432
You're real poisonous
son-of-a-bitch, aren't you?

749
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,201
Just heed the warning.

750
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:46,874
Don't ever go over
my head again.

751
00:46:51,478 --> 00:46:54,549
There were no casualties,
just several injured.

752
00:46:54,582 --> 00:46:58,052
Lucky for us that the
observation pod was so robust.

753
00:46:58,085 --> 00:46:59,887
The humans are very
naive if they think

754
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,956
such a primitive system is
enough to annihilate our ship.

755
00:47:03,824 --> 00:47:05,993
I suggest that we
strike back and take

756
00:47:06,026 --> 00:47:08,362
a sizable proportion
of the humans out.

757
00:47:08,395 --> 00:47:09,496
Not just the military.

758
00:47:11,332 --> 00:47:12,933
The governments of
Earth need to feel

759
00:47:12,966 --> 00:47:15,537
the maximum impact
of our firepower.

760
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:18,005
There is no room
for diplomacy now.

761
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:25,012
You advice is reckless

762
00:47:25,045 --> 00:47:27,114
and not in line with
Gweldor's wishes

763
00:47:27,147 --> 00:47:28,882
for a peaceful resolution.

764
00:47:28,916 --> 00:47:30,552
We'll reconvene this evening

765
00:47:30,585 --> 00:47:32,920
to decide what the
next step will be.

766
00:47:36,924 --> 00:47:37,559

00:47:39,393 --> 00:47:40,194
You okay?

768
00:47:42,996 --> 00:47:43,997
Yeah, yeah.

769
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:47,901
We're in a stand
down at the minute,

770
00:47:47,935 --> 00:47:51,372
so, just hoping that that lasts.

771
00:47:51,405 --> 00:47:52,507
Yeah, let's hope so.

772
00:47:57,978 --> 00:47:59,012
Okay?

00:48:00,682 --> 00:48:02,483
Yeah, I'm, I'm good.

774
00:48:07,988 --> 00:48:10,023
I do need to tell
you something though.

775
00:48:11,024 --> 00:48:12,159
Yeah, okay.

776
00:48:12,192 --> 00:48:13,026
What?

Hey, hey, look, look, whatever
it is, you can tell me.

778
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,034
I know.

779
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:25,105
I just don't want to
heap more pressure on you

780
00:48:25,139 --> 00:48:26,473
during all of this.

781
00:48:26,508 --> 00:48:28,510
Come on, look, it'll be fine.

782
00:48:28,543 --> 00:48:30,645
You can tell me anything,
I'll understand.

783
00:48:32,146 --> 00:48:32,980
Okay.

784
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:43,625
I'm pregnant.

785
00:48:45,392 --> 00:48:46,360
Holy shit.

786
00:48:49,363 --> 00:48:54,067
Is that like a good
holy shit or a bad one?

We really didn't plan this

790
00:49:09,416 --> 00:49:11,151
so I was worried
how you'd react.

791
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,054
I'm delighted.

792
00:49:15,422 --> 00:49:17,124
I'm so relieved.

00:49:17,958 --> 00:49:20,093
I know the timing
is rough right now.

794

No, no, we shouldn't,
we shouldn't,

795
00:49:23,397 --> 00:49:26,200
we shouldn't worry
about that at all, okay?

796
00:49:26,233 --> 00:49:29,169
It was going to happen
sooner or later, right?

797
00:49:29,203 --> 00:49:30,037
Right.

798
00:49:31,472 --> 00:49:33,140
Have you told your mom?

799
00:49:34,609 --> 00:49:36,977
No, not yet, I wanted
to talk to you first.

gonna be delighted.

[Reporter] The White House
today issued a statement

814
00:50:41,408 --> 00:50:44,211
crushing speculation that
the extraterrestrials

815
00:50:44,244 --> 00:50:47,481
have approached them about
a potential ceasefire.

Spokesmen Clarence
Bodicker reiterated

817
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:51,853
that it was United States policy

818
00:50:51,886 --> 00:50:53,821
not to negotiate
with terrorists,

819
00:50:53,855 --> 00:50:56,456
but that no such
approaches have been made.

820
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:58,458
He said that any
communication between

821
00:50:58,492 --> 00:51:00,762
the United States
military and the aliens

822
00:51:00,795 --> 00:51:03,096
resulted in hostility.

823
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:05,299
Mr. Bodicker also
reminded the public

824
00:51:05,332 --> 00:51:07,134
to remain in their
homes and said

825
00:51:07,167 --> 00:51:09,369
that additional law
enforcement will be deployed

826
00:51:09,403 --> 00:51:12,272

adhere to the guidelines.

in privately making contact

with one of the alien crafts?

843
00:51:56,316 --> 00:51:58,151
I'd like you to be
a correspondence

844
00:51:58,185 --> 00:52:02,322
which doesn't involve
the military or
intelligence branches.

845
00:52:02,356 --> 00:52:03,357
What would be the purpose?

846
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:05,526
Well, to try to establish
better relations.

847
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:08,195
I mean, perhaps we
can arrange the return

of the captives and
their equipment.

If I'm hearing you correctly,

850
00:52:13,333 --> 00:52:17,505
you're suggesting that we
circumvent the military,

851
00:52:17,538 --> 00:52:21,643
the White House, and negotiate
with the aliens privately?

852

Well, if you want
to put it that way.

crazy for good men

00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:47,622
My husband and I were
driving back to New Hampshire

893
00:54:48,288 --> 00:54:50,625
after a vacation in Montreal.

894
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:56,664
We saw a light
anomaly in the sky.

895
00:54:57,865 --> 00:55:01,569
We pulled over at a picnic area
just south of Twin Mountain.

896
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:06,541
We got out of the car
to take a closer look

897
00:55:06,574 --> 00:55:11,344
and it appeared to be
some kind of a craft.

898
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:17,384
It hovered very close, so
we returned to the car.

899
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:23,090
Suddenly the car
began to vibrate,

900
00:55:24,158 --> 00:55:28,529
and we both felt a tingling
sensation through our bodies.

901
00:55:30,064 --> 00:55:34,769
Then there was this onset of,
I don't know how to put it.

902
00:55:35,937 --> 00:55:37,104
It was like...

903
00:55:38,539 --> 00:55:42,009
It was like an altered
state of consciousness,

904
00:55:42,043 --> 00:55:45,079
like our minds were being doped.

905
00:55:48,082 --> 00:55:50,450
There was a strong
beam of light.

906
00:55:51,484 --> 00:55:54,121
It felt magnetic.

907
00:55:54,155 --> 00:55:56,456
It drew us up out of the car

908
00:55:56,489 --> 00:55:58,693
and up towards the
underside of the craft.

909
00:55:58,726 --> 00:56:02,395
The hatch opened and
sucked us inside.

910
00:56:04,899 --> 00:56:09,904
There was a corridor,
more like a tunnel.

911
00:56:11,172 --> 00:56:14,474
It was dark, but I could make
out some of the architecture.

912
00:56:15,343 --> 00:56:18,145
It was unlike anything
I'd ever seen,

913
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:21,916
like something out of a
science fiction movie.

914
00:56:26,754 --> 00:56:30,057
Two aliens accosted
us in the corridor.

915
00:56:31,491 --> 00:56:34,161
I knew resistance
would be futile, like,

916
00:56:34,195 --> 00:56:37,430
I didn't try to fight them as
they led us down the corridor.

917
00:56:39,466 --> 00:56:42,970
The aliens didn't seem
overly aggressive,

918
00:56:43,004 --> 00:56:46,841
but they clearly
had a plan for us.

919
00:56:51,012 --> 00:56:54,849
They experimented on us
in an examination room

920
00:56:54,882 --> 00:56:56,017
aboard the craft.

921
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:04,759
One of the creatures put a
large needle in my stomach.

922
00:57:07,061 --> 00:57:12,066
I screamed in pain and
they seem surprised.

923
00:57:14,702 --> 00:57:19,607
One of them laid a hand on
me and the pain left me.

924
00:57:22,576 --> 00:57:27,581
I wondered why, if their
motives were vindictive,

925
00:57:28,249 --> 00:57:29,684
they would take away my pain.

926
00:57:32,887 --> 00:57:34,689
Perhaps, but I
got the impression

927
00:57:34,722 --> 00:57:37,692
they were curious
about our species,

928
00:57:37,725 --> 00:57:39,927
not out to harm us.

929
00:57:43,698 --> 00:57:46,734
I think they are always
trying to communicate with us.

930
00:57:48,202 --> 00:57:49,637
We don't listen.

931
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:52,540
[pensive music]

932
00:57:58,179 --> 00:58:03,117
-[tense music]
-[footsteps thudding]

933
00:58:05,653 --> 00:58:09,657
I've decided to take the
lead in this mission.

934
00:58:10,758 --> 00:58:12,860
Are you sure, sir?

935
00:58:12,893 --> 00:58:15,963
A true leader is judged by
the equality of his actions

936
00:58:15,997 --> 00:58:18,199
and the integrity of his intent.

937
00:58:18,232 --> 00:58:19,166
I understand.

938
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,702
I'll take the reigns
in the command center

939
00:58:21,736 --> 00:58:23,871
during the mission.

940
00:58:23,904 --> 00:58:26,607
[tense music]

941
00:58:27,641 --> 00:58:29,276
Gentlemen, were getting reports

942
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:31,545
that several alien
ships have left Earth.

943
00:58:31,579 --> 00:58:34,815
They're just hovering
in our exosphere,

944
00:58:34,849 --> 00:58:37,251
and the mothership
is still on Earth.

945
00:58:38,285 --> 00:58:40,721
At this time, it's unclear
what their strategy is,

946
00:58:40,755 --> 00:58:42,823
but we do not think it's
an official retreat.

947
00:58:42,857 --> 00:58:45,826
They're fixing to do
something up there.

948
00:58:47,028 --> 00:58:47,862
Good or bad,

949
00:58:50,031 --> 00:58:52,600
I'm afraid we just
have to wait and see.

950
00:58:52,633 --> 00:58:55,269
[energetic music]

951
00:59:06,947 --> 00:59:09,583
[Alien] We're ready
for the order, sir.

952
00:59:11,619 --> 00:59:14,088
[Magon] The Reptilian
crafts are hovering.

953
00:59:14,121 --> 00:59:16,724
Their mothership
is leading the way.

954
00:59:16,757 --> 00:59:19,760
Do you have it in your sight?

955
00:59:19,794 --> 00:59:21,996
[Gweldor] I'm just looking in.

956
00:59:22,029 --> 00:59:24,865
[energetic music]

957
00:59:31,072 --> 00:59:34,975
[Magon] Is the Reptilian
mothership in range?

958
00:59:36,343 --> 00:59:37,144
Fire.

959
00:59:37,178 --> 00:59:40,147
[ominous music]

960
00:59:40,181 --> 00:59:41,782
A direct hit.

961
00:59:41,816 --> 00:59:43,851
All ships engage.

962
00:59:43,884 --> 00:59:48,889
-[spaceships firing]
-[suspenseful music]

963
01:00:10,311 --> 01:00:13,347
[Alien] All enemy
crafts obliterated.

964
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:16,383
[Magon] The Reptilian
ships have been dispatched.

965
01:00:16,417 --> 01:00:20,621
All of our crafts disengage
and return to Earth.

966
01:00:22,022 --> 01:00:23,657
The enemy has engaged
with some other

967
01:00:23,691 --> 01:00:25,259
unidentified hostile force.

968
01:00:27,394 --> 01:00:29,196
And at this time, it's
too early to speculate,

969
01:00:29,230 --> 01:00:31,899
but we believe that
these aliens were at war

970
01:00:31,932 --> 01:00:34,802
with another species
who also happened

971
01:00:34,835 --> 01:00:36,103
to be headed towards Earth.

972
01:00:37,271 --> 01:00:38,906
I mean, the upshot is...

973
01:00:40,708 --> 01:00:41,709
Interesting.

974
01:00:43,878 --> 01:00:45,012
I mean, after everything,

975
01:00:47,448 --> 01:00:48,682
they defended our planet.

976
01:00:59,894 --> 01:01:02,830
[Neil] This is Neil Taylor,
representative of NASA,

977
01:01:02,863 --> 01:01:05,866
the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration.

978
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:08,469
I'm seeking to speak
with whoever's in
charge of your fleet.

979
01:01:08,502 --> 01:01:10,804
[Gweldor] This is
Gweldor of Zeta Reticuli.

980
01:01:10,838 --> 01:01:12,940
[Neil] You speak English.

981
01:01:12,973 --> 01:01:14,175
[Gweldor] Yes.

982
01:01:14,208 --> 01:01:16,410
[Neil] I'm contacting
you confidentially.

983
01:01:16,443 --> 01:01:18,746
This does not have the
endorsement of our President

984
01:01:18,779 --> 01:01:20,848
or any other military
or intelligence agency

985
01:01:20,881 --> 01:01:22,049
in the United States.

986
01:01:23,284 --> 01:01:24,685
I propose we set a meeting.

987
01:01:26,521 --> 01:01:27,888
Perhaps we can provide mediation

988
01:01:27,922 --> 01:01:29,456
between those in
power on this planet

989
01:01:29,490 --> 01:01:30,925
and we can end the bloodshed.

990
01:01:32,459 --> 01:01:35,462
[suspenseful music]

991
01:02:25,145 --> 01:02:26,347
Gweldor?

992
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:27,281
[Gweldor] Yes.

993
01:02:27,314 --> 01:02:29,483
[Neil] Sorry to meet like this.

994
01:02:29,517 --> 01:02:31,485
My superiors are concerned
about the fallout

995
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:33,120
from air battles in this region.

996
01:02:34,288 --> 01:02:36,023
I come to you with
the greatest respect

997
01:02:36,056 --> 01:02:39,226
and hope that we can engage
in peaceful relations.

998
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:42,296
Would you like to
come aboard our ship?

999
01:02:42,329 --> 01:02:44,832
[tense music]

1000
01:02:47,001 --> 01:02:48,969
You have no need to
fear for your safety.

1001
01:02:49,003 --> 01:02:51,905
There have been too many
casualties on both sides.

1002
01:02:51,939 --> 01:02:54,842
We are seeking a
peaceful resolution.

1003
01:02:54,875 --> 01:02:58,012
[Neil] Yes, I'd
like to come aboard.

1004
01:03:04,552 --> 01:03:06,186
You're from Zeta Reticuli?

1005
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:07,522
[Gweldor] Yes.

1006
01:03:07,555 --> 01:03:09,189
We've been visiting planet Earth

1007
01:03:09,223 --> 01:03:11,859
periodically for many years.

1008
01:03:11,892 --> 01:03:13,861
[Neil] Why did you
make those visits?

1009
01:03:13,894 --> 01:03:15,996
We have since
ancient civilization.

1010
01:03:16,030 --> 01:03:18,165
In fact, we have formed
the basis for much

1011
01:03:18,198 --> 01:03:20,501
of what is now ingrained
in your culture.

1012
01:03:20,535 --> 01:03:22,369
Your species is unique in that

1013
01:03:22,403 --> 01:03:24,071
you have a consciousness capable

1014
01:03:24,104 --> 01:03:26,006
of the greatest
love from divinity.

1015
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:28,876
Yet your power and
energy is often channeled

1016
01:03:28,909 --> 01:03:31,278
into the creation of conflict.

1017
01:03:31,312 --> 01:03:33,247
As a consciousness,
you are all one.

1018
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,983
Yet you act like
there is a separation.

1019
01:03:36,016 --> 01:03:37,251
[McCaffrey] We've
identified the location

1020
01:03:37,284 --> 01:03:40,588
where the alien crafts
have landed in a cluster.

1021
01:03:40,622 --> 01:03:43,857
It is time for the ultimate
solution, Mr. President.

1022
01:03:43,891 --> 01:03:46,860
[President] I didn't
want it to come to this.

1023
01:03:46,894 --> 01:03:48,896
[McCaffrey] None of us did, sir.

1024
01:03:48,929 --> 01:03:51,932
[President] How many
estimated casualties?

1025
01:03:51,965 --> 01:03:53,535
[McCaffrey] With
operable placement,

1026
01:03:53,568 --> 01:03:58,573
maybe only 40 to 50% of
the regional population.

1027
01:03:59,973 --> 01:04:00,941
[President] Those are
pretty high figures.

1028
01:04:00,974 --> 01:04:04,278
We don't need to release
those figures publicly.

1029
01:04:04,311 --> 01:04:06,548
The media will cooperate.

1030
01:04:06,581 --> 01:04:08,982
The key message we
need to get out there

1031
01:04:09,016 --> 01:04:12,052
is that we have eradicated
the alien threat.

1032
01:04:14,988 --> 01:04:16,924
[Neil] Do you think
we're gonna make it?

1033
01:04:16,957 --> 01:04:19,561
Yes, there are billions
of people on the planet,

1034
01:04:19,594 --> 01:04:24,298
but a change in perception
can start with just one.

1035

1036
01:04:57,965 --> 01:05:00,568
[horns honking]

1037

[crowd clamoring]

1038
01:05:11,378 --> 01:05:15,182
[Protester] This is
about saving democracy,

1039
01:05:15,215 --> 01:05:16,984
abiding by the laws.

1040
01:05:17,017 --> 01:05:19,654
Our fathers are turning
in their graves.

1041
01:05:19,687 --> 01:05:21,321
[Reporter] Thousands of
people took to the streets

1042
01:05:21,355 --> 01:05:22,990
in Washington and Nevada today

1043
01:05:23,023 --> 01:05:25,025
to protest at the war
and lockdown measures

1044
01:05:25,058 --> 01:05:27,060
imposed by the
government as a result

1045
01:05:27,094 --> 01:05:29,664
of the ongoing battle
with extraterrestrials.

1046
01:05:29,697 --> 01:05:31,733
White House spokesperson
Patty Bainbridge

1047
01:05:31,766 --> 01:05:34,067
described the protesters
as irresponsible

1048
01:05:34,101 --> 01:05:36,738
and selfish for disobeying
the government guidelines.

1049
01:05:36,771 --> 01:05:38,706
Miss Bainbridge warned
that stricter measures

1050
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:42,075
may be imposed if people
continue to flout the rules.

1051
01:05:42,109 --> 01:05:45,078
This is Chuck Fallon
reporting for WGYN.

1052
01:05:51,351 --> 01:05:54,354
[suspenseful music]

1053
01:05:57,191 --> 01:05:58,091
The futility of war.

1054
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:03,464
Oceans of blood spills
in every battle.

1055
01:06:07,067 --> 01:06:08,736
Is it worth it?

1056
01:06:08,770 --> 01:06:10,471
Beneath every uniform beats a

1057
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:15,476
heart that needs peace and love,

1058
01:06:16,076 --> 01:06:18,145
not death and destruction.

1059
01:06:18,546 --> 01:06:20,548
A soldier fights
for our freedom,

1060
01:06:21,749 --> 01:06:26,019
but they themselves
will never be free.

1061
01:06:26,053 --> 01:06:28,155
They'll never be free
from the bad memories

1062
01:06:30,558 --> 01:06:31,559
or the trauma,

1063
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:35,095
if they don't
sacrifice the body,

1064
01:06:36,396 --> 01:06:37,765
they sacrifice the mind.

1065
01:06:39,099 --> 01:06:42,269
Governments tell their citizens

1066
01:06:42,302 --> 01:06:47,107
it's about democracy,
and safety.

1067
01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:49,677
Bullshit.

1068
01:06:52,714 --> 01:06:56,116
The truth is, no
government in history

1069
01:06:57,217 --> 01:06:58,620
ever put the needs of the people

1070
01:06:59,787 --> 01:07:03,123
before their own
thirst for power.

1071
01:07:03,156 --> 01:07:07,027
Western society has
been set up to benefit

1072
01:07:09,396 --> 01:07:13,535
the powerful, wealthy
elite, while the rest of us

1073
01:07:14,501 --> 01:07:18,673
contend with the social
and economic hardship.

1074
01:07:19,574 --> 01:07:23,043
The whole damned
system needs to change.

1075
01:07:27,281 --> 01:07:29,483
But there is one ray of sunshine

1076
01:07:31,118 --> 01:07:33,588
shining through
these dark clouds.

1077
01:07:36,456 --> 01:07:41,461
These psychopaths that
send these men off to war,

1078
01:07:42,396 --> 01:07:47,167
line their own pockets,
underestimate one thing,

1079
01:07:51,138 --> 01:07:52,205
the human spirit.

1080
01:07:55,309 --> 01:07:59,279
There is a soldier
in every one of us,

1081
01:08:01,248 --> 01:08:05,152
a warrior ready to
fight through the fear,

1082
01:08:05,185 --> 01:08:06,854
stand in their own sovereignty.

1083
01:08:11,191 --> 01:08:15,663
No government can
ever take that away.

1084
01:08:15,697 --> 01:08:18,265
[somber music]

1085
01:08:19,333 --> 01:08:21,368
[Romney] Vietnam, 1970,

1086
01:08:21,401 --> 01:08:23,236
I was a forward observer.

1087
01:08:24,672 --> 01:08:26,239
I was just a kid.

1088
01:08:27,575 --> 01:08:29,443
My most frightening experience,

1089
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:33,146
the bombs from dropping.

1090
01:08:34,114 --> 01:08:36,651
I was lying face down
in the slit trench,

1091
01:08:37,619 --> 01:08:41,188
the brim of my helmet
buried in the soft dirt,

1092
01:08:41,221 --> 01:08:43,190
as close to the
earth as I could get.

1093
01:08:45,593 --> 01:08:47,662
I was holding my breath.

1094
01:08:50,364 --> 01:08:53,868
The whining stopped,
there was a pause.

1095
01:08:53,901 --> 01:08:55,770
Then two or 300 yards away,

1096
01:08:55,803 --> 01:08:58,271
another cluster
of bombs exploded,

1097
01:08:59,107 --> 01:09:01,843
a deep, heavy
rumbling detonation.

1098
01:09:04,879 --> 01:09:06,547
I had plenty of time to think,

1099
01:09:07,749 --> 01:09:10,852
but nothing came to
mind except the fact

1100
01:09:10,885 --> 01:09:13,921
that the next detonation was
going to have my number on it.

1101
01:09:18,893 --> 01:09:21,763
Then the next bomb exploded,

1102
01:09:21,796 --> 01:09:25,165
the same all-embracing
blanket detonation.

1103
01:09:27,434 --> 01:09:28,536
It took me a minute,

1104
01:09:29,704 --> 01:09:31,806
then I realized I
hadn't been hit.

1105
01:09:33,908 --> 01:09:35,308
I raised myself up.

1106
01:09:36,276 --> 01:09:40,247
The flares were dim, and
in the half darkness,

1107
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:43,417
I saw a figure running
across the field.

1108
01:09:43,450 --> 01:09:47,487
And for the first time since
I jumped in that slit trench,

1109
01:09:48,188 --> 01:09:50,758
I realized that I wasn't alone.

1110
01:09:50,792 --> 01:09:52,694
I was surrounded by trenches

1111
01:09:52,727 --> 01:09:54,529
filled with my fellow soldiers.

1112
01:09:55,963 --> 01:09:56,798
I wanted,

1113
01:09:57,899 --> 01:10:01,969
no, I needed to talk to them.

1114
01:10:02,003 --> 01:10:04,572
[somber music]

1115
01:10:07,274 --> 01:10:09,944
I sat in the trench for
a couple of minutes,

1116
01:10:09,977 --> 01:10:13,280
trying to decide whether
the raid [indistinct].

1117
01:10:13,313 --> 01:10:14,816
I couldn't make up my mind.

1118
01:10:16,450 --> 01:10:20,420
I was unable to bring into
focus the obvious facts

1119
01:10:20,454 --> 01:10:21,923
that the flares were stopping

1120
01:10:21,956 --> 01:10:24,224
and the planes were
almost out of earshot.

1121
01:10:25,358 --> 01:10:27,461
[somber music]

1122
01:10:27,494 --> 01:10:29,329
I never did make up my mind,

1123
01:10:30,131 --> 01:10:32,365
but I did want to
talk to somebody.

1124
01:10:33,601 --> 01:10:34,802
So I got out of the trench

1125
01:10:34,836 --> 01:10:37,304
and ran a couple of
yards to a dugout,

1126
01:10:38,039 --> 01:10:39,674
with boards and dirt on top.

1127
01:10:41,408 --> 01:10:42,643
I was still shaking,

1128
01:10:44,411 --> 01:10:45,680
but I could breathe.

1129
01:10:49,650 --> 01:10:53,688
I was very self-conscious
about just how scared I was.

1130
01:10:55,723 --> 01:10:58,291
There were two of my
friends in that bunker.

1131
01:10:58,325 --> 01:10:59,961
They'd picked up a stray puppy.

1132
01:11:01,328 --> 01:11:02,897
I crawled in and
laughed at the pup

1133
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:05,566
because it was shaking
as bad as I was.

1134
01:11:07,702 --> 01:11:11,338
We spent 15 minutes
discussing the raid,

1135
01:11:11,371 --> 01:11:13,908
and talking the terror
out of our system.

1136
01:11:15,442 --> 01:11:17,444
At the time, that's
all you can do.

1137
01:11:19,046 --> 01:11:21,481
You're shell-shocked and
you have to survive it

1138
01:11:21,516 --> 01:11:23,518
and move forward in
the midst of battle.

1139
01:11:25,853 --> 01:11:29,791
It's not until you get home
and try to live a normal life

1140
01:11:29,824 --> 01:11:34,327
that you realize just how
battle-scarred your mind is.

1141
01:11:34,361 --> 01:11:36,964
[somber music]

1142
01:11:37,999 --> 01:11:43,370
Navajo believe that death
is a natural occurrence,

1143
01:11:44,906 --> 01:11:46,406
and not something to be feared.

1144
01:11:50,511 --> 01:11:52,947
In the Native
American perspective,

1145
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:55,448
death is not a defeat.

1146
01:11:58,553 --> 01:12:01,889
They really have a wide
sense of perspective.

1147
01:12:03,490 --> 01:12:07,360
I guess that's what's
happening to us right now.

1148
01:12:10,798 --> 01:12:15,803
It's like all our lives,
we've been asleep.

1149
01:12:19,674 --> 01:12:22,577
Now, finally, we're awake.

1150
01:12:26,647 --> 01:12:29,416
[somber music]

1151
01:12:35,488 --> 01:12:38,025
[birds chirping]

1152
01:12:41,662 --> 01:12:44,464
Congratulations, you two.

1153
01:12:44,497 --> 01:12:46,567
Thank you, mom.

1154
01:12:46,601 --> 01:12:48,435
Thanks, Elaine.

1155
01:12:48,468 --> 01:12:50,503
How do you feel about
being a grandmother?

1156
01:12:51,438 --> 01:12:55,743
-Oh, old.

01:13:10,791 --> 01:13:14,028
-Captain Turner speaking.
-Yes, sir.

1159
01:13:15,229 --> 01:13:18,633
[Turner] I've got a C-L-Y
priority on a one, one, three.

1160
01:13:18,666 --> 01:13:20,467
Give me the code numbers.

1161

[ominous music]

1163
01:13:36,584 --> 01:13:39,587
[McCaffrey] Sir, are you
ready to give the order?

1164
01:13:40,554 --> 01:13:41,589
Sir?

1165
01:13:42,957 --> 01:13:45,425
Mr. President, are you there?

1166
01:13:46,827 --> 01:13:47,728
[President] Yes.

1167
01:13:50,798 --> 01:13:52,667
[McCaffrey] It is time
for the ultimate solution,

1168
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:53,801
Mr. President.

[Military Office Worker] We're
ready for the order, sir.

1172
01:14:21,662 --> 01:14:23,064
[Military Office Worker]
If we hit the targets

1173
01:14:23,097 --> 01:14:25,533
from the south side, we
should get optimal placement.

1174
01:14:26,667 --> 01:14:28,035
[Military Office
Worker] We're ready.

1175

[McCaffrey] Are you
ready to give the order?

1181
01:14:49,623 --> 01:14:50,825
[President] Yes.

1182
01:14:50,858 --> 01:14:52,793
I'm giving the order.

1183
01:14:52,827 --> 01:14:54,929
[McCaffrey] May
history write you well.

the human spirit.

1190
01:16:50,344 --> 01:16:54,682
There is soldier
in every one of us,

through the fear,

1192
