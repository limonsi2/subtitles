00:00:21,677 --> 00:00:23,480
Tis the season.

4
00:00:23,514 --> 00:00:27,388
Branch's down here
looking like a whole snack.

5
00:00:27,421 --> 00:00:29,125
And... gotcha!

6
00:00:29,158 --> 00:00:33,400
‐ Buckle up, kids.
‐ Hey, love the bow tie.

7
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:36,372
Well, you know,
it is the holiday season,

8
00:00:36,406 --> 00:00:38,276
which is why
I brought you these.

9
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,414
Mitten‐settia, my favorite.

10
00:00:41,382 --> 00:00:44,121
That's too bad, I'm allergic.

11
00:00:44,155 --> 00:00:45,525
Yeah, too bad.

12
00:00:47,328 --> 00:00:49,633
And we're done with that.

13
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,537
Ugh.

14
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,108
Uh, Poppy, I know
we're going on a picnic

15
00:00:54,141 --> 00:00:56,112
but do we really need
this much food?

16
00:00:56,145 --> 00:00:58,483
It's not food,
they're invitations

17
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:01,289
that we're going to deliver
for the first annual

18
00:01:01,322 --> 00:01:03,661
Trolls kingdom
sacred holiday Giftswap.

19
00:01:03,694 --> 00:01:05,130
First annual, what?

20
00:01:05,163 --> 00:01:06,466
What happen to the whole
balloon ride

21
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:09,272
over Trolls kingdom
hang out kinda thing?

22
00:01:09,305 --> 00:01:11,543
Branch, we're still doing that.
We're just multitasking.

23
00:01:11,577 --> 00:01:14,683
‐ Multitasking. Right.
‐ Alright, here's the deal.

24
00:01:14,716 --> 00:01:17,454
I put a name inside
each of these invitations...

25
00:01:17,488 --> 00:01:19,793
Whoever gets your name
is your secret person.

26
00:01:19,826 --> 00:01:21,630
‐ Ooh.
‐ Pa‐pa‐pop. Secret.

27
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,868

00:03:30,988 --> 00:03:33,293
Sounds like you lost your flow.

Oh, wait. We almost forgot
to grab our own invitations.

81
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,903
Oh, man.
Giftswaps are so my jam.

82
00:03:54,936 --> 00:03:56,974
Yeah, you do give
the best gifts.

83
00:03:57,007 --> 00:03:59,311
It's super intimidating.

00:04:02,418 --> 00:04:03,854
Oh, no.

85
00:04:03,888 --> 00:04:05,658

‐ Well...
‐ Totally cool.

89
00:04:09,498 --> 00:04:10,868
Better get to work on a present

90
00:04:10,902 --> 00:04:12,471

Okay, catch up with you.

Oh, what the...

Hey there, little friend.
You seem like your not okay.

101
00:04:51,884 --> 00:04:54,789
I hope that I can help you rhyme
and have you on your way.

102
00:04:54,823 --> 00:04:56,793
I'm looking for a word
that rhymes with diamond

103
00:04:56,827 --> 00:04:59,533
so I can finish my rap
and get my flow back.

104
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,102
Got any suggestions?

00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:03,039
Ah, let me get I wanna think.

00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,426
Climate! Yes!

110
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:14,796
Climate is the best
I could find.

00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,034

You're a life saver, Poppy.

128

00:06:04,963 --> 00:06:06,465
Hmm. Oh.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's a secret... Giftswap.

135
00:06:24,636 --> 00:06:26,573

136
00:06:26,607 --> 00:06:28,009
‐ Oh, yeah, that's cool.
‐ Okay, I respect that.

137
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:31,617
It's Branch! I got Branch!
Isn't that so exciting? Ah!

138
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,990
Wait, you got your boyfriend?
That's a lot of pressure.

139
00:06:35,023 --> 00:06:38,162
Pressure? Come on.
It's me we're talking about.

140
00:06:38,196 --> 00:06:41,435
The gift master.
The giftanator.

141
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:42,805
I've got it covered.

142
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:46,412
‐ Who did you get?
‐ Mr. Dinkles. Whoever that is.

143
00:06:46,445 --> 00:06:48,483
Oh, that's Biggie's pet.
He's a worm.

144
00:06:48,517 --> 00:06:51,022
A worm? That's awesome.

145
00:06:51,055 --> 00:06:52,759
But, what do I get a worm?

146
00:06:52,792 --> 00:06:55,898
Get him a hat.
He lost his old one.

147
00:06:55,932 --> 00:06:57,969
Contemplating his existence

148
00:06:58,002 --> 00:07:01,677
Monsieur Dinkles clings
to solace of his trusty hat.

149
00:07:06,118 --> 00:07:08,056
See.
I'm full of giftsparation.

150
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:09,793
And there's plenty to go around.

151
00:07:09,826 --> 00:07:11,730
Alright guys, not gonna lie.

152
00:07:11,763 --> 00:07:13,166
I've been kinda freakin' out

153
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,769
over what to get
the Ultimate gift giver.

154
00:07:14,803 --> 00:07:16,773
But I think I've figured it out.

155
00:07:16,807 --> 00:07:19,478
Woah, nice vision board, Branch.

156
00:07:19,512 --> 00:07:22,819
And not at all, insane looking.

157
00:07:22,852 --> 00:07:24,221
Thank you. Okay.

158
00:07:24,254 --> 00:07:25,992
As everybody knows
giving the wrong gift

159
00:07:26,025 --> 00:07:27,929
can be a real relationship
death sentence.

160
00:07:27,962 --> 00:07:30,801
If I go to small,
I'll disappoint her.

161
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:36,178
If I go to big,
I'll freak her out.

162
00:07:36,212 --> 00:07:37,515
I can't let that happened.

163
00:07:37,548 --> 00:07:38,917
So, I came up with an equation

164
00:07:38,951 --> 00:07:41,022
that led me to
the perfect gift for Poppy.

165
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,558
A, represents Queen Poppy.

166
00:07:42,592 --> 00:07:44,562
B, is all of her
Queenly responsibilities.

167
00:07:44,596 --> 00:07:46,533
C, is the amount of time spent

168
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,637
doing her hair every morning.
Therefore...

169
00:07:50,808 --> 00:07:53,212
Well, you both see
where I'm going with this?

170
00:07:53,246 --> 00:07:54,983
Poppy, never stops multitasking.

171
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:58,022
So, I'm gonna build her
something will save her time.

172
00:07:58,056 --> 00:08:01,663
I give you the world's
first troll hair doer.

173
00:08:01,697 --> 00:08:03,032
I just need to go
to Poppy's place

174
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,803
and get the exact
measurements of her head

175
00:08:04,836 --> 00:08:06,940
without her noticing
and I'm good to go.

176
00:08:06,973 --> 00:08:10,715
Well, that doesn't sound
creepy at all.

177
00:08:10,748 --> 00:08:11,817
Tiny?

178
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,989
Are you playing some kind of
holiday hide and seek?

179
00:08:15,023 --> 00:08:17,294
'Cause, if so, you win.

180
00:08:17,327 --> 00:08:18,997
Tiny!

181
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:20,133
Tiny, where are you?

182
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,204
Sick cave, Wind Breeze.

183
00:08:22,237 --> 00:08:24,743
Well, come in,
sweet sparkle child.

184
00:08:24,776 --> 00:08:27,114
Your father is
quite worried about you.

185
00:08:27,147 --> 00:08:29,051
Yeah, yeah, I know.
I don't wanna worry him.

186
00:08:29,084 --> 00:08:30,721
But I can't get home
until I get my flow back.

187
00:08:30,755 --> 00:08:33,894
Uh‐uh‐uh.
I already know why you're here.

188
00:08:33,927 --> 00:08:37,869
Alright. Just gotta sit back
and get mystical.

189
00:08:37,902 --> 00:08:39,572
Whoa!

190
00:08:41,175 --> 00:08:42,745
Why don't you love me?

191
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:46,118
Tiny, why don't you love me?

192
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:56,272
And we're done. Your back
should be completely healed.

193
00:08:56,305 --> 00:08:57,942
My back? What?

194
00:08:57,975 --> 00:09:00,113
No, I came here
to get my flow back.

195
00:09:00,146 --> 00:09:01,583
I really need to get rhyming

196
00:09:01,616 --> 00:09:03,587
so I can get my daddy
his holiday gift.

197
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,756
What do I do now?

198
00:09:04,789 --> 00:09:06,626
Well, you go see the Cloud Monks

199
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,733
at the temple
on the top of that mountain.

200
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:11,770
I gotta go all the way up
to that mountain?

201
00:09:11,803 --> 00:09:14,041
No, no, not that mountain.

202
00:09:14,074 --> 00:09:15,043
That mountain.

203
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,790
Okay.

204
00:09:21,823 --> 00:09:24,662
This is for my daddy!

205
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:28,169
Come on. Tiny, you can do it.

206
00:09:30,073 --> 00:09:32,545
Whoa! That's one.

207
00:09:33,514 --> 00:09:36,018
Wow, Poppy, you are
so good at gift giving.

208
00:09:36,051 --> 00:09:38,322
Hey, when you gots it,
you gots it.

209
00:09:38,356 --> 00:09:41,195
"Operation Measure Poppy's Head"
is a go.

210
00:09:41,228 --> 00:09:44,101
And then I realized, "Why am I
not using double sided tape."

211
00:09:44,134 --> 00:09:46,673
I mean, it's basically twice
as good as single sided tape.

212
00:09:46,706 --> 00:09:47,942
The clue's in the name,
you know what I mean?

213
00:09:47,975 --> 00:09:50,380
Branch, what you doin'
there, little bud?

214
00:09:50,413 --> 00:09:52,819
Oh, hey, wassup...

215
00:09:52,852 --> 00:09:55,056
Branch! What a nice surprise.

216
00:09:55,089 --> 00:09:56,258
Yeah. Surprise.

217
00:09:56,292 --> 00:09:59,933
Just came by to borrow some
wrapping paper for my gift.

218
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:03,774
Whoa! Poppy, is this
your Giftswap present?

219
00:10:03,807 --> 00:10:05,845
‐ It looks great.
‐ Nope. That one's mine.

220
00:10:05,878 --> 00:10:08,349
But it was Poppy that
turned it up so pretty.

221
00:10:08,382 --> 00:10:09,986
Sure was. Totally. Guys!

222
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:11,756
My gift box for Branch
is out in the open.

223
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,859
He's gonna know I got him.

224
00:10:12,892 --> 00:10:14,696
Oh, my pumpkin pie.

225
00:10:14,729 --> 00:10:16,265
We're on it, Poppy.

226
00:10:16,298 --> 00:10:18,269
Well, look at the time.

227
00:10:18,302 --> 00:10:19,672
We better be hitting the road.

228
00:10:19,706 --> 00:10:21,208
We gotta go, um...

229
00:10:21,242 --> 00:10:22,410
go take care of our cats.

230
00:10:22,444 --> 00:10:24,849
What?
When did you get cats?

231
00:10:24,883 --> 00:10:26,252
Ah...

232
00:10:26,285 --> 00:10:27,989
Meow. Meow, meow.

233
00:10:30,226 --> 00:10:32,063
Okay, see you around, bye.

234
00:10:32,097 --> 00:10:34,836
Uh, anyway like I was saying,
I just need to borrow

235
00:10:34,869 --> 00:10:37,107
some wrapping paper
and then I'll be on my way.

236
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,712
Okay, here you go.
Now let's get you outta here.

237
00:10:39,746 --> 00:10:41,115
Wait, wait, wait.
I‐I...

238
00:10:41,148 --> 00:10:44,121
‐ I wanna remember this.
‐ What? Why?

239
00:10:44,154 --> 00:10:45,691
Because...
Picture!

240
00:10:47,695 --> 00:10:50,066
Perfect. I'll cherish
this moment forever.

241
00:10:52,204 --> 00:10:54,274
Poppy got me?

242
00:10:54,308 --> 00:10:57,113
And the gift is so big.

243
00:10:57,147 --> 00:10:59,919
Wait,
you forgot the wrapping paper.

244
00:10:59,953 --> 00:11:01,723
I'll probably just
use grocery bags.

245
00:11:01,756 --> 00:11:03,760
You know, reuse,
reduce, recycle.

246
00:11:03,794 --> 00:11:06,700
Now, that boy is odd.

247
00:11:10,473 --> 00:11:12,778
‐ Hmm...
‐ Wow, looks good.

248
00:11:12,812 --> 00:11:14,448
Mm‐hmm.
Poppy's gonna love that.

249
00:11:14,481 --> 00:11:16,686
Yeah, you're right.
It's not big enough.

250
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,022
Her gift was ginormous.

251
00:11:18,055 --> 00:11:19,759
I'm gonna build
a scrap booking machine

252
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:21,295
and attach it
to the hair stylist.

253
00:11:24,067 --> 00:11:26,773
Sweet.
Now it's definitely done.

254
00:11:26,806 --> 00:11:28,409
Agreed.
Still gotta go bigger.

255
00:11:28,442 --> 00:11:31,181
I'll attach a smoothie maker
so Poppy can her hair done,

256
00:11:31,215 --> 00:11:33,019
make scrap books
and drink her favorite

257
00:11:33,052 --> 00:11:35,791
blueberries‐banana smoothie.
Great idea.

258
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:41,101
It's perfect.

259
00:11:41,135 --> 00:11:43,039
Prince D, you wanna
take her for a spin?

260
00:11:43,072 --> 00:11:46,713
‐ Uh, yeah, no.
‐ Alright. Here, I am.

261
00:11:46,746 --> 00:11:48,884
My hair's getting done
and then I'm like,

262
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,222
"Oh, rats, I forgot
to make a scrap book

263
00:11:51,255 --> 00:11:52,725
for Biggie's half birthday."

264
00:11:58,971 --> 00:12:01,475
It's working.
It's working!

265
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:03,246
Yep. Sure is.

266
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,784
And now for the final touch.

267
00:12:05,818 --> 00:12:08,222
A smoothie maker!

268
00:12:24,121 --> 00:12:26,058
So what did you end up
getting Poppy?

269
00:12:26,091 --> 00:12:27,227
What?

270
00:12:28,195 --> 00:12:32,003
Ooh!
I think I broke my butt.

271
00:12:40,921 --> 00:12:43,125
Guys, how am I suppose
to get my flow back

272
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:48,336
if you're all doing
this vow of silence thing?

273
00:12:51,543 --> 00:12:53,814
"You already have the Gift."

274
00:12:53,847 --> 00:12:56,185
Pff, that's nonsense tea.

275
00:13:01,128 --> 00:13:03,299
"Look through the clutter."

276
00:13:03,332 --> 00:13:04,802
What clutter?

277
00:13:04,836 --> 00:13:09,344
Come on, Tiny.
What makes him so special?

278
00:13:09,378 --> 00:13:11,549
What do you mean,
"What makes him so special?"

279
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,319
He's just my...

280
00:13:15,056 --> 00:13:16,291
Daddy!

281
00:13:18,329 --> 00:13:20,366
Yeah! Okay!

282
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,972

‐ Ow!
‐ Wassup, Branch?

300
00:14:03,954 --> 00:14:06,225
You look, uh...
You look bad, man.

301
00:14:06,258 --> 00:14:09,164
No other way to say it.
What happened?

302
00:14:09,197 --> 00:14:10,333
I failed, Tiny.

303
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:14,041
I tried to make Poppy a gift
and it blew up in my face.

304
00:14:14,074 --> 00:14:16,178
‐ Literally.
‐ Say no more, bro.

305
00:14:16,211 --> 00:14:19,217
‐ Let Tiny help you out.
‐ Yeah? Okay.

306
00:14:19,251 --> 00:14:20,954
You just need to look
through the clutter

307
00:14:20,988 --> 00:14:23,125
and focus on what's important.

308
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:25,496
You already have the gift, dude.

309
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,169
You already have it.

310
00:14:35,316 --> 00:14:37,253
Bla‐laow!

311
00:14:40,627 --> 00:14:43,867
You see it now, don't you?

312
00:14:44,535 --> 00:14:46,539
Nope, not even a little bit.

313
00:14:46,573 --> 00:14:51,014
Oh, come on! The winds even blew
in a magical way.

314
00:14:57,561 --> 00:15:00,266
"Look through the clutter."

315
00:15:12,558 --> 00:15:14,595
You always know just what to get

316
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:18,369
to make someone feel special,
don't you, Poppy?

317
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,980
I'm sure Branch
is gonna love his gift.

318
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,452
Yeah.

319
00:15:28,022 --> 00:15:30,126
I hope you're right.

320
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,700
Hello, everyone!

321
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:37,073
Who's ready for
the Holiday Giftswap?

322
00:15:41,048 --> 00:15:43,419
Come on, dad, let's go.

323
00:15:48,462 --> 00:15:50,166
Ooh, it's lit.

324
00:15:50,734 --> 00:15:52,538
Wooho! I love it!

325
00:15:52,571 --> 00:15:54,207
Ah! Cool!

326
00:15:57,247 --> 00:16:00,453
A "Never‐break‐guitar"?
I've always wanted one of these.

327
00:16:00,486 --> 00:16:02,323
I know.

328
00:16:03,627 --> 00:16:06,298
Here you go, little dude.

329
00:16:06,331 --> 00:16:08,402
Merci.

330
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:09,404
So, um...

331
00:16:09,437 --> 00:16:12,010
‐ Who did you get? Oh.
‐ Who did you get? Oh.

332
00:16:13,345 --> 00:16:15,551
I'll tell you if you tell me.

333
00:16:15,584 --> 00:16:17,320
Uh, both of us at the same time?

334
00:16:17,353 --> 00:16:19,592
One, two three.

335
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,696
‐ You.
‐ You.

336
00:16:23,465 --> 00:16:25,169
Okay, um...

337
00:16:25,203 --> 00:16:26,539
Do you wanna go first?

338
00:16:26,573 --> 00:16:30,213
Well, I made you this really,
really cool thing.

339
00:16:30,246 --> 00:16:31,749
I'm sure it's great.

340
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:34,087
But it exploded
and blew me into a tree.

341
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,791
Oh, that's not‐‐ not so great.

342
00:16:35,824 --> 00:16:38,597
Yeah, I may have
over done it a bit.

343
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:40,499
Anyway...

344
00:16:40,534 --> 00:16:43,239
this is all I could
scrape together.

345
00:16:43,272 --> 00:16:44,509
Here.

346
00:16:46,245 --> 00:16:48,984
I know it's kinda lame.

347
00:17:01,676 --> 00:17:03,312
Branch...

348
00:17:03,345 --> 00:17:05,383
you scrap booked...

349
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:06,519
for me?

350
00:17:06,553 --> 00:17:07,755
Yeah.

351
00:17:07,788 --> 00:17:09,157
And I think I permanently glues

352
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,794
two of my fingers together
doing it.

353
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,232
I love it.

354
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:16,138
It's a gift
only you could give me.

355
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,579
Okay, um, now it's my turn.

356
00:17:19,612 --> 00:17:20,647
Ooh!

357
00:17:26,793 --> 00:17:28,563
‐ Huh?
‐ Huh?

358
00:17:28,597 --> 00:17:30,801
Well, that sucks.

359
00:17:30,834 --> 00:17:32,805
Oh, hey‐hey, cool.

360
00:17:32,838 --> 00:17:34,842
An invisible mountain bike?

361
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:38,516
No way!
I got the same thing.

362
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,819
I...

363
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:41,789
I didn't get you anything.

364
00:17:41,823 --> 00:17:44,194
Because when I tried
to think about

365
00:17:44,227 --> 00:17:47,166
what to get the coolest Troll
in the whole world

366
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,637
I‐I totally drew a blank.

367
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:53,145
I mean, what do you even
get someone who is so sweet,

368
00:17:53,178 --> 00:17:56,485
and so funny,
and kind and cute

369
00:17:56,519 --> 00:18:01,161
and, like, weirdly
over prepared for everything.

370
00:18:01,194 --> 00:18:02,564
You know...

371
00:18:02,598 --> 00:18:06,806
the thing I like most about
the holidays is just...

372
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:08,710
being together...

373
00:18:08,743 --> 00:18:10,479
with you.

374
00:18:11,616 --> 00:18:13,485

I love that idea.

‐ Hey.
‐ Everyone!

mouths closed,

00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:04,995
How about another balloon ride
over Troll Kingdom?

440
00:21:05,029 --> 00:21:06,732
No multitasking?

441
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,370
Nope. Just you and me.

00:21:11,843 --> 00:21:14,314
Oh, yeah!

443
00:21:14,347 --> 00:21:16,586

Happy holidays!
