- No. Why?

00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:14,597
I don't know, you know.
You just said, like...

102
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:17,513
that we could film you
at my crib and shit
when we cast you.

103

Like this behind the scenes
look at a professional actress.

104
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,126
Yeah, of course.

105
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:25,042
By the way,
your house is amazing.

106
00:09:25,086 --> 00:09:27,044
You know that when
you sign that contract,

107
00:09:27,088 --> 00:09:30,874
there's this little section that
says "any and all footage--"

108
00:09:30,918 --> 00:09:32,354
Ray will be fine.

109
00:09:32,397 --> 00:09:33,529
No problemo.

00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,836

00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:38,795

I have to warn you,
I'm like, totally method now.

116
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:51,460

a little scary and weird.

That's our business.

118

00:10:00,034 --> 00:10:01,862
It will after this movie,

151
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:12,715
Should I try it on?
This looks tight.

What up, my paranormalists?

158
00:11:36,783 --> 00:11:40,612
It's time
for your favorite podcast,
"Beyond Paranormal."

159
00:11:40,656 --> 00:11:44,747
I am your host and fellow freak
Juice McDaniels.

160
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:49,578
Our special guest this month is
world renowned quantum physicist

161
00:11:49,621 --> 00:11:52,320
Dr. Ulrich von Strauss.

162
00:11:52,363 --> 00:11:55,018
And today we will be asking
the question

163
00:11:55,062 --> 00:11:57,107
"Is time travel possible?"

164
00:11:57,151 --> 00:12:00,937
Better question,
do you travel in time

165
00:12:00,981 --> 00:12:03,026
or does time travel to you?

166
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,768
Time and space can
be manipulated,

167
00:12:05,812 --> 00:12:08,989
fused together
and then displaced

168
00:12:09,032 --> 00:12:12,514
to create a window to
a completely different reality.

169
00:12:12,557 --> 00:12:14,951
Realities are what we make.
Ain't that right, Doc?

170
00:12:14,995 --> 00:12:19,913
Some of us live in between
realities and dimensions.

171
00:12:19,956 --> 00:12:21,958
You think
we are not alone?

172
00:12:22,002 --> 00:12:24,787
Oh, absolutely
we're not alone.

173
00:12:24,831 --> 00:12:27,529
We've been visited
by many alien life forms...

174
00:12:27,572 --> 00:12:29,574

[laughs]

176
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,669
I'm writing.

177
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,369
Did you sign
the release form yet?

178
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:49,812
Don't worry,
I'll get him to sign.

179
00:12:49,856 --> 00:12:54,121
These "ver" glasses are like
looking into another dimension.

180
00:12:54,164 --> 00:13:00,562
This is my first...
ASMR video.

181
00:13:00,605 --> 00:13:03,260
Robert, thank you so much
for the bear.

182
00:13:03,304 --> 00:13:05,959
Oh, he's so cute
and so fluffy,

183
00:13:06,002 --> 00:13:08,178
like a little white cloud.

184
00:13:08,222 --> 00:13:10,702
I'm going to sleep with him
right now.

185
00:13:10,746 --> 00:13:13,880
Oh, yeah, I can't "bear"
to sleep without him.

186
00:13:13,923 --> 00:13:16,012
Don't be jealous, Ray.

187
00:13:22,105 --> 00:13:23,672
Oh, shoot.

188
00:13:23,715 --> 00:13:25,369
Well, that's not good.

189
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:29,330
Hey, everybody,
it's Box Girl Lilly.

190
00:13:29,373 --> 00:13:33,029
Welcome to Lilly vloggin'
the vlog.

191
00:13:33,073 --> 00:13:35,249
[clears throat]
Okay.

192
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:41,342
Hey, guys, Lilly here again.

193
00:13:41,385 --> 00:13:44,258
So this is harder
than I thought.

194
00:13:44,301 --> 00:13:46,303
Um...

195
00:13:46,347 --> 00:13:49,350
But you guys will
totally dig the next video,

196
00:13:49,393 --> 00:13:52,135
and don't forget
to hit the like button.

197
00:13:57,053 --> 00:13:59,055
"Don't forget to tune in
and hit the like button."

198
00:13:59,099 --> 00:14:01,623
Hit the like button,
people.

199
00:14:02,711 --> 00:14:06,323
Hey, guys,
are you ready?

200
00:14:12,503 --> 00:14:15,419
[groans] Babe, will you
scratch my back, please?

201
00:14:15,463 --> 00:14:19,162
[sighs] This novel
is driving me crazy.

202
00:14:19,206 --> 00:14:21,773
Ugh. It's like
I'm writing in circles.

203
00:14:21,817 --> 00:14:25,647
Mm-hmm.

204
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,910
What's with the creepy statue?

205
00:14:27,954 --> 00:14:29,825
Oh, I know.
Cool, right?

206
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,958
Yeah.

207
00:14:32,001 --> 00:14:34,656
If by "cool"
you mean super creepy.

208
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:37,354
Yeah, it's cool.
It's really cool. [sighs]

209
00:14:37,398 --> 00:14:39,704
Can you please not
bring evil shit in the house

210
00:14:39,748 --> 00:14:41,576
that may have
evil shit attached to it?

211
00:14:41,619 --> 00:14:43,883
[moans]
Like what?

212
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:46,015
Like,
you know what I mean.

213
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:48,191
- Stuff.
- What stuff?

214
00:14:48,235 --> 00:14:49,540
Evil shit
can attach to things,

215
00:14:49,584 --> 00:14:52,282
and those things
can attach to us.

216
00:14:52,326 --> 00:14:54,197
Like bedbugs.

217
00:14:54,241 --> 00:14:56,460
I'm serious.

218
00:14:56,504 --> 00:14:58,767
I promise,
no evil parasitic juju.

219
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,203
This isn't a joke.

220
00:15:00,247 --> 00:15:03,641
Ow!
Is that real bone?

221
00:15:03,685 --> 00:15:06,731
My director thought
it would inspire creativity,

222
00:15:06,775 --> 00:15:08,951
Speaking of creativity,

223
00:15:08,995 --> 00:15:12,999
I think my brain's
been sucked all of mine.

224
00:15:15,566 --> 00:15:16,959
Oh, you're bleeding.

225
00:15:17,003 --> 00:15:20,397
You just need to relax.

226
00:15:22,878 --> 00:15:24,488
You know I need to write.

227
00:15:24,532 --> 00:15:28,884
Is this house not the best
writing retreat ever?

228
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,103
It's okay.

229
00:15:30,146 --> 00:15:31,278
Have you seen
the hot tub?

230
00:15:31,321 --> 00:15:32,714
Hello.

231
00:15:32,757 --> 00:15:34,498
I can't bring the computer
into the hot tub.

232
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:36,805
You're so cranky.

233
00:15:36,848 --> 00:15:39,373
What? My editor's
breathing down my neck.

234
00:15:39,415 --> 00:15:41,244
I mean, my advance
is almost gone,

235
00:15:41,288 --> 00:15:42,680
and as soon
as we get back home,

236
00:15:42,724 --> 00:15:44,204
we're gonna have a stack
of bills waiting for us.

237
00:15:44,247 --> 00:15:47,294
Honey, my website Patreon
is killing it right now,

238
00:15:47,337 --> 00:15:51,646
and I'm making a movie,
so don't worry about money.

239
00:15:51,689 --> 00:15:54,388
That's easy for you to say.

240
00:15:56,216 --> 00:15:59,915
I know what you need
for inspiration.

241
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,090
[laughs]

242
00:16:01,134 --> 00:16:02,700
What are you--

243
00:16:02,744 --> 00:16:05,573
- Mm.
- [sighs]

244
00:16:05,616 --> 00:16:07,053
Oh, that's...

245
00:16:07,096 --> 00:16:08,315
so...

246
00:16:08,358 --> 00:16:10,882
[ominous music]
That's...

247
00:16:10,926 --> 00:16:13,885
Oh, God, that's good.

248
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:15,931
What is that?

249
00:16:17,498 --> 00:16:20,283
Uh, a camera.

250
00:16:20,327 --> 00:16:21,719
Is it on?

251
00:16:21,763 --> 00:16:23,765
Mm-hmm.
You want me to stop?

252
00:16:23,808 --> 00:16:25,419
- Uh, yes.
- Yeah?

253
00:16:25,462 --> 00:16:27,725
- Ah. No.
- No?

254
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:29,510
- No.
- Stop?

255
00:16:29,553 --> 00:16:32,295
Ugh.
how do I turn it off?

256
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:34,428
[breathing heavily]

257
00:16:34,471 --> 00:16:38,345
Oh, God,
where's the off button?

258
00:16:38,388 --> 00:16:40,608
Oh, babe,
how do I shut it off?

259
00:16:40,651 --> 00:16:42,088
Oh.

260
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:48,137
[ominous music]

261
00:17:21,953 --> 00:17:25,044
Babe.
Did you see that light?

262
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:31,876
You're sleepwalking.

263
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,836
No, I'm not sleepwalk--

264
00:17:34,879 --> 00:17:37,447
Lilly. Lilly.

265
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:39,971
There's someone
standing over you.

266
00:17:42,322 --> 00:17:46,108
- You're dreaming.
- No, I am not dreaming.

267
00:17:51,505 --> 00:17:53,246
Where?

268
00:17:56,988 --> 00:17:59,556
Shit.

269
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,123
I must be dreaming.

270
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:11,960
Geek it down
a little bit here, fellas.

271
00:18:12,003 --> 00:18:14,702
I gotta call
my girl anyway, so...

272
00:18:14,745 --> 00:18:16,486
get the fuck out of here.

273
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,748
Why bother?

274
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:19,228
I can just hack
into her webcam

275
00:18:19,272 --> 00:18:21,230
and you can
remotely broadcast.

276
00:18:21,274 --> 00:18:23,928
Word?

277
00:18:23,972 --> 00:18:26,540
Shit, that's like some
big brother shit right there.

278
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,629
[laughs]

279
00:18:28,672 --> 00:18:31,458
Now we in your house
and you don't even know it.

280
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:32,720
[laughs]

281
00:18:32,763 --> 00:18:35,157
Read 'em and weep, boys.

282
00:18:35,201 --> 00:18:39,118
That's what I'm talking
about, girl. [laughs]

283
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:41,424
Oh, hello.

284
00:18:41,468 --> 00:18:43,861
I didn't know anyone
was there.

285
00:18:43,905 --> 00:18:45,776
Hey, how'd you get him to sign
the release form, Lilly?

286
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,127
Never underestimate a woman.

287
00:18:51,478 --> 00:18:54,394
Baby girl,
I knew you would deliver,

288
00:18:54,437 --> 00:18:56,178
and I got to say,

289
00:18:56,222 --> 00:18:59,094
you and your man boy
make some pretty great pixels.

290
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,227
Thank you.
That's so sweet.

291
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,793
But I'm just-- I'm worried

292
00:19:02,837 --> 00:19:04,926
because not too many people
have watched.

293
00:19:04,969 --> 00:19:07,581
Girl, people gonna watch
the shit if it's scary.

294
00:19:07,624 --> 00:19:09,278
And guess what?

295
00:19:09,322 --> 00:19:11,759
Might be a little extra
bonus pay for you if it's hot.

296
00:19:11,802 --> 00:19:14,414
[laughs]
Feel me?

297
00:19:14,457 --> 00:19:16,242
Oh, it will be.

298
00:19:16,285 --> 00:19:18,026
By the way, how am I doing
with the camera?

299
00:19:18,069 --> 00:19:19,723
Fantastic, Lilly.

300
00:19:19,767 --> 00:19:22,944
You're broadcasting
as we speak.

301
00:19:22,987 --> 00:19:24,859
So when can I see
some footage?

302
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,778
Oh, shit, girl,
I'ma show you the footage.

303
00:19:30,821 --> 00:19:34,173
I know, I just-- I feel like
I'm, like, I don't know.

304
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:35,522
I'm, just, like,
this insecure artist.

305
00:19:35,565 --> 00:19:37,524
I'm like...
I'm crazy. So...

306
00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:39,221
what can I do to help?

307
00:19:39,265 --> 00:19:40,657
Know what? I got it.

308
00:19:40,701 --> 00:19:43,443
You gonna take the red light
on the camera,

309
00:19:43,486 --> 00:19:45,271
and you gonna mark it out

310
00:19:45,314 --> 00:19:48,317
and then you won't know
when we filming and when
we not filming.

311
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:50,058
That's genius.

312
00:19:50,101 --> 00:19:53,061
[laughs]
Sometimes it happens that way.

313
00:19:53,104 --> 00:19:54,802
I-- I can't control the shit.

314
00:19:54,845 --> 00:19:57,587
Well, I have to tell you I can't
video-chat with you anymore

315
00:19:57,631 --> 00:19:59,546
because my character
wouldn't do that.

316
00:19:59,589 --> 00:20:01,069
'Cause you method and shit.

317
00:20:01,112 --> 00:20:02,592
That's why I hired you, mama.

318
00:20:02,636 --> 00:20:04,420
I like it. I like it a lot.

319
00:20:04,464 --> 00:20:05,943
[groans]

320
00:20:08,076 --> 00:20:12,167
Lilly isn't here anymore...

321
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,217
minion.

322
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,045
My name is Roxanne.

323
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:25,572
Now and how.

324
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:29,140
Just kidding.

325
00:20:29,184 --> 00:20:32,318
All right, guys. See ya.
Thank you. Bye bye.

326
00:20:32,361 --> 00:20:35,712
[ominous music]

327
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:47,202
What up,
my conspiracy realists?

328
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,378
I am your host,
Juice McDaniels.

329
00:20:49,422 --> 00:20:52,512
It's Beyond Paranormal.

330
00:20:52,555 --> 00:20:55,558
Look, let's just dive
right into it, flat Earthers.

331
00:20:55,602 --> 00:20:57,604
You ever sleep
with your eyes open?

332
00:20:57,647 --> 00:20:59,954
Do you see things
that don't exist?

333
00:20:59,997 --> 00:21:03,305
Or perhaps you find yourself
lying on the floor.

334
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:05,481
[Lilly singing indistinct]

335
00:21:05,525 --> 00:21:07,178
And I'm not talking about
partying the night before.

336
00:21:07,222 --> 00:21:10,834
Maybe, just maybe you're
a vessel for traveling

337
00:21:10,878 --> 00:21:12,575
into another dimension.

338
00:21:12,619 --> 00:21:14,969
Babe,
I'm trying to concentrate.

339
00:21:15,012 --> 00:21:17,667
Juice: Today we will look
into outer body experiences

340
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:20,583
and the dangers
that lurk in your--

341
00:21:26,372 --> 00:21:29,636
No, no, no, no, no.
Come on.

342
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,508
Come on. You gotta
be freaking kidding me.

343
00:21:32,552 --> 00:21:34,858
Babe,
did you touch anything?

344
00:21:47,871 --> 00:21:50,221
[Lilly exhales]

345
00:21:50,265 --> 00:21:54,661
Lilly meditates to thrust
herself into character.

346
00:21:54,704 --> 00:21:56,532
You know, babe, I--

347
00:21:56,576 --> 00:22:00,362
I might have figured out my
inciting incident for my book.

348
00:22:00,406 --> 00:22:03,365
[sighs]

349
00:22:03,409 --> 00:22:05,367
[Southern accent]
What you whinin' about?

350
00:22:05,411 --> 00:22:08,544
Ain't no thing
but a chicken wing.

351
00:22:08,588 --> 00:22:10,416
You got taters
in your ears?

352
00:22:10,459 --> 00:22:11,460
Oh, baby.

353
00:22:11,504 --> 00:22:13,941
- [hisses]
- [groans]

354
00:22:16,944 --> 00:22:22,819
This is Lilly
really getting into character.

355
00:22:22,863 --> 00:22:24,386
Who are you this time, babe?

356
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,866
You got anything to drink?

357
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:28,390
I'm so God dang thirsty
right now.

358
00:22:28,434 --> 00:22:30,087
You know we're out of milk.

359
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:32,351
You got some browns?

360
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:34,004
Excuse me.

361
00:22:34,048 --> 00:22:36,703
My daddy used to say,
"Stay away from them browns,"

362
00:22:36,746 --> 00:22:39,662
but I sure
do like them.

363
00:22:39,706 --> 00:22:43,318
Browns.

364
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,364
Bourbon.
Brown liquor.

365
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:48,279
Oh. Yeah.

366
00:22:48,323 --> 00:22:50,543
[slurps]

367
00:22:50,586 --> 00:22:53,372
Why is this thing always--?

368
00:22:55,069 --> 00:22:59,682
Where's that fine piece of ass
you got around here, hmm?

369
00:22:59,726 --> 00:23:02,816
Pardon me?

370
00:23:02,859 --> 00:23:04,165
Brunette.

371
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:07,473
Perfect little titties
made from God.

372
00:23:07,516 --> 00:23:09,475
- Right.
- Ass of a teenager.

373
00:23:09,518 --> 00:23:12,478
Mm-hmm.
You must mean Lilly.

374
00:23:12,521 --> 00:23:16,395
- That your girl?
- Sometimes.

375
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:18,919
No, that ain't her.

376
00:23:18,962 --> 00:23:21,487
Got anything to eat?

377
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,880
Oh.

378
00:23:28,624 --> 00:23:32,280
Then you must mean
Miss Roxanne.

379
00:23:32,323 --> 00:23:34,456
Yeah.

380
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,632
Yeah, that's the bitch.

381
00:23:36,676 --> 00:23:40,767
She got one tight satchel.

382
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:43,900
I been waiting a long time
to tap that...

383
00:23:43,944 --> 00:23:48,078
Oh, maybe youse put in
a good word, huh?

384
00:23:48,122 --> 00:23:49,210
Yeah, I'll do that.

385
00:23:49,253 --> 00:23:50,907
What's that thing?

386
00:23:50,951 --> 00:23:52,213
Camera.

387
00:23:52,256 --> 00:23:55,956
How about you
shut that shit off?

388
00:23:55,999 --> 00:23:59,002
I mean, technically, I'm really
not supposed to 'cause...

389
00:23:59,046 --> 00:24:02,919
How's about I take that camera
from your hand, boy,

390
00:24:02,963 --> 00:24:04,791
and I shove it up
your God dang ass.

391
00:24:04,834 --> 00:24:06,183
That's not funny, Lilly.

392
00:24:06,227 --> 00:24:08,708
Done. I'm done.

393
00:24:28,858 --> 00:24:32,514
Oh, shit.

394
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:44,744
Swear, this novel
is trying to kill me.

395
00:24:46,833 --> 00:24:48,878
Now and how, minion.

396
00:24:48,922 --> 00:24:52,012
Lie down or I'll
scratch it till it bleeds.

397
00:24:52,055 --> 00:24:54,493
That's some outfit.

398
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:56,059
Do you like it?

399
00:24:56,103 --> 00:24:57,626
My director picked it out.

400
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:00,324
[sighs]
Of course he did.

401
00:25:00,368 --> 00:25:02,457
Silence.

402
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:06,200
You've been a bad little boy.

403
00:25:06,243 --> 00:25:09,725
Babe, with the creepy statue?
It really freaks me out.

404
00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:13,990
Ray, you said
you wouldn't be so judgey.

405
00:25:14,034 --> 00:25:16,297
What's with the scotch?

406
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,603
Helps me write.

407
00:25:17,646 --> 00:25:20,127
Shut up, bed slave.

408
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:24,087
Now and how.

409
00:25:24,131 --> 00:25:26,220
I'm so fucked right now.

410
00:25:26,263 --> 00:25:28,091
My publisher wants pages.

411
00:25:28,135 --> 00:25:29,658
You should have seen
the email.

412
00:25:29,702 --> 00:25:31,225
It's totally preposterous.

413
00:25:31,268 --> 00:25:36,056
She wants the first
150 pages.

414
00:25:36,099 --> 00:25:38,537
Ah. God.

415
00:25:40,277 --> 00:25:42,671
Please, God, give me
a sign I should be a writer.

416
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,631
[sighs]

417
00:25:45,674 --> 00:25:49,460
Hey, I thought we both agreed
no filming bedroom stuff.

418
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,116
Relax, baby.

419
00:25:54,988 --> 00:25:56,555
It isn't on.

420
00:26:00,384 --> 00:26:02,909
Do you need your muse?

421
00:26:02,952 --> 00:26:04,867
Yeah, where's she at?

422
00:26:04,911 --> 00:26:07,522
Shut your mouth,
my love slave.

423
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:11,308
Now and how.

424
00:26:11,352 --> 00:26:13,615
- Now and how?
- Mm-hmm.

425
00:26:13,659 --> 00:26:15,922
Okay.

426
00:26:15,965 --> 00:26:18,881
"Okay" what?

427
00:26:18,925 --> 00:26:22,624
Okay...

428
00:26:22,668 --> 00:26:24,191
Roxanne.

429
00:26:24,234 --> 00:26:27,194
- Aah.
- Miss Roxanne.

430
00:26:27,237 --> 00:26:29,370
Miss Roxanne.

431
00:26:29,413 --> 00:26:31,720
Isn't my dominatrix name
so cool?

432
00:26:31,764 --> 00:26:34,070
Yeah,
more like nymphomaniac.

433
00:26:34,114 --> 00:26:36,377
I read the script.

434
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:39,206
Not super excited about
all the explicit sex stuff.

435
00:26:39,249 --> 00:26:42,992
It's totally superfluous.
Who copulates with a corpse?

436
00:26:43,036 --> 00:26:44,559
It's a metaphor.

437
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,127
A metaphor.
In a horror movie.

438
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:48,519
Totally absurd.

439
00:26:48,563 --> 00:26:51,000
Are you doing nudity
in this film?

440
00:26:51,044 --> 00:26:52,306
Sex sells.

441
00:26:52,349 --> 00:26:54,438
You know that, Ray.

442
00:26:58,399 --> 00:27:00,531
[groans]

443
00:27:00,575 --> 00:27:02,882
What--
What are you doing?

444
00:27:02,925 --> 00:27:07,626
I'm going to make my little Ray
rise from the dead.

445
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:11,673
Little Ray.
I'm a grower, not a shower.
You know that.

446
00:27:11,717 --> 00:27:15,198
Okay. Well, let's see
how much little Ray--

447
00:27:15,242 --> 00:27:18,854
I mean "big Ray," can grow.

448
00:27:20,769 --> 00:27:22,553
Lilly--

449
00:27:22,597 --> 00:27:25,774
Miss Roxanne.

450
00:27:25,818 --> 00:27:28,734
Yes, my love slave?

451
00:27:30,431 --> 00:27:34,043
- Now and how.
- Now?

452
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,352
I'm really tired.

453
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:44,967
Fine.

454
00:27:47,274 --> 00:27:50,277
- I thought you said it wasn't--
- [camera beeps]

455
00:27:55,761 --> 00:27:59,895
And don't you dare wake me up
with one of your stupid dreams.

456
00:28:03,856 --> 00:28:05,858
Little help.

457
00:29:47,742 --> 00:29:52,312
[chanting]

458
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,063
What a whackadoodle.

459
00:30:11,984 --> 00:30:16,031
[chanting]

460
00:30:25,606 --> 00:30:28,652
Traveling astrally
has been dated back

461
00:30:28,696 --> 00:30:31,307
to the oldest of books.

462
00:30:31,351 --> 00:30:34,876
Do you think it's possible
to meditate across the state?

463
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,400
I had the craziest
dream last...

464
00:30:37,444 --> 00:30:39,620
With the right incantation,

465
00:30:39,663 --> 00:30:43,015
people have been able
to travel in time,

466
00:30:43,058 --> 00:30:44,581
space,

467
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:47,062
even across galaxies

468
00:30:47,106 --> 00:30:50,761
with other worlds
and other species.

469
00:30:50,805 --> 00:30:52,763
Oh, brother.

470
00:30:53,895 --> 00:30:56,289
I have a collection of mantras
you can use

471
00:30:56,332 --> 00:30:58,030
for such a journey.

472
00:30:59,379 --> 00:31:02,121
Oh, thank you.

473
00:31:02,164 --> 00:31:05,167
Like, so generous.

474
00:31:09,128 --> 00:31:10,956
You got any snake oil
for purchase?

475
00:31:10,999 --> 00:31:15,308
Remember,
traveling can be dangerous.

476
00:31:15,351 --> 00:31:21,531
Evil horn dwellers
can attach themselves
to the wandering soul.

477
00:31:21,575 --> 00:31:22,924
Evil horn dwellers.

478
00:31:22,968 --> 00:31:25,840
Why would you--
Attach to who now?

479
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,276
Don't mind him.

480
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,713
No, see,
this is exactly the kind

481
00:31:29,757 --> 00:31:32,020
of paranormal shit
I was talking about.

482
00:31:32,064 --> 00:31:35,328
- Angela, meet...
- Raymond.

483
00:31:35,371 --> 00:31:36,938
Have we met?

484
00:31:36,982 --> 00:31:40,159
Ah, no. Lilly must have
told me your name.

485
00:31:40,202 --> 00:31:42,596
Hello, Ray.

486
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:44,903
I need to write.

487
00:31:44,946 --> 00:31:46,861
Ray!

488
00:31:49,168 --> 00:31:53,041
Yo, this girl's stupid,
but she mad good, though.

489
00:31:53,085 --> 00:31:56,175
Yo, IT, while you're down there,
I could use a little release.

490
00:31:56,218 --> 00:31:58,090
[laughs]

491
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:02,094
- We're all fixed.
- Hey, what?

492
00:32:02,137 --> 00:32:05,358
Both: Must have been
a power surge.

493
00:32:05,401 --> 00:32:07,447
So we up?

494
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:09,275
Camera is live, bitches.

495
00:32:09,318 --> 00:32:11,146
[laughs]
We live.

496
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:15,020
All right, let's see
how much little Ray--

497
00:32:15,063 --> 00:32:19,285
I mean "big Ray," can grow.

498
00:32:19,328 --> 00:32:20,982
Ray:
Oh, Miss Roxanne.

499
00:32:25,247 --> 00:32:27,206
What?

500
00:32:27,249 --> 00:32:30,165
What else
do I have to do?

501
00:32:35,562 --> 00:32:37,042
[sighs]

502
00:32:40,697 --> 00:32:42,699
[breathing heavily]

503
00:32:50,664 --> 00:32:52,709
[breathing heavily]

504
00:32:52,753 --> 00:32:55,234
[growls]

505
00:32:56,887 --> 00:32:58,019
Jeez!

506
00:32:58,063 --> 00:33:00,108
Oh.

507
00:33:00,152 --> 00:33:03,285
You scared the hell
out of me.

508
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,332
[growls softly]

509
00:33:07,768 --> 00:33:10,162
I'm just meditating, babe.

510
00:33:10,205 --> 00:33:11,902
Trying to give me
a heart attack.

511
00:33:11,946 --> 00:33:13,861
[sighs]
Will you relax?

512
00:33:13,904 --> 00:33:16,298
If I wanted to scare you,
it'd be easy.

513
00:33:16,342 --> 00:33:18,039
Next time you meditate,

514
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:19,867
could you please keep
the covers on me?

515
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:21,347
It's hot in here.

516
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:23,392
Only it's not hot.
It's freezing.

517
00:33:23,436 --> 00:33:25,655
I'm hot!

518
00:33:27,744 --> 00:33:31,444
[Lilly moans softly]

519
00:33:31,487 --> 00:33:34,360
Come on now.
You know you want it.

520
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:41,541
Now and how.

521
00:33:43,717 --> 00:33:45,762
I'm so hot...

522
00:33:45,806 --> 00:33:49,027
you could fry an egg
on the hood of my ride.

523
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:52,117
Feel that heat
coming from my chassis.

524
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,988
Oh, yeah. Just--
Let's just kinda--

525
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,947
Oh, my radiator's so hot.

526
00:33:56,991 --> 00:33:59,254
My thermostat's about to pop.

527
00:33:59,298 --> 00:34:01,648
[moans]

528
00:34:01,691 --> 00:34:03,824
All right, Roxanne,
let's do this.

529
00:34:03,867 --> 00:34:08,697
[both moaning]

530
00:34:10,525 --> 00:34:13,312
Oh, now... now...

531
00:34:13,355 --> 00:34:15,879
Oh, now. Now!

532
00:34:15,922 --> 00:34:18,143
Now! Aah!

533
00:34:18,186 --> 00:34:20,058
And how!

534
00:34:20,101 --> 00:34:22,973
Oh! Oh, God.

535
00:34:23,016 --> 00:34:27,065
[moans]

536
00:34:36,161 --> 00:34:39,033
Oh, you came really fast.

537
00:34:40,947 --> 00:34:43,081
Sure could use a release.

538
00:34:54,744 --> 00:34:58,618
[thunder rumbling]

539
00:35:06,843 --> 00:35:08,367
[baby crying]

540
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:10,717
Shh.

541
00:35:51,671 --> 00:35:55,457
[baby continues crying]

542
00:36:18,611 --> 00:36:20,961
[speaks foreign language]

543
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:33,060
[gasps]

544
00:36:55,474 --> 00:36:58,216
Had the weirdest dream
last night.

545
00:36:59,869 --> 00:37:02,394
[ominous music]

546
00:37:11,141 --> 00:37:13,927
Oh, yeah?
What about?

547
00:37:20,107 --> 00:37:22,501
Nothin'.

548
00:37:31,858 --> 00:37:34,817
Welcome back,
my comrades in conspiracy.

549
00:37:34,861 --> 00:37:37,516
Today,
significant spirit animals

550
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:39,474
and how it relates
to your life.

551
00:37:39,518 --> 00:37:43,217
Now, personally,
I like to gravitate
towards more being...

552
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,567
[hisses]

553
00:37:50,746 --> 00:37:55,403
Embody me with
all the light and darkness.

554
00:37:55,447 --> 00:38:01,975
Invade my soul with
the gift of life everlasting.

555
00:38:02,018 --> 00:38:05,979
I am your vessel.

556
00:38:19,253 --> 00:38:21,124
Yeah, it's the spirit animal.

557
00:38:21,168 --> 00:38:23,823
Many powerful women
in arts and literature.

558
00:38:31,613 --> 00:38:33,049
[inhales sharply]

559
00:38:33,093 --> 00:38:34,877
The only animal
that moves its wings

560
00:38:34,921 --> 00:38:36,314
in a figure-eight pattern...

561
00:38:39,404 --> 00:38:41,188
...and other magical gifts

562
00:38:41,231 --> 00:38:44,017
include healing
and the manipulation of time.

563
00:38:59,859 --> 00:39:02,557
What-- What do you mean
the manipulation of time?

564
00:39:02,601 --> 00:39:09,564
Well, it has the innate ability
to pause and move forward

565
00:39:09,608 --> 00:39:11,349
and even back in time.

566
00:39:11,392 --> 00:39:13,786
And on the spiritual side,

567
00:39:13,829 --> 00:39:15,962
the tiny wing blossom dancer

568
00:39:16,005 --> 00:39:18,094
reminds us to cherish the day.

569
00:39:18,138 --> 00:39:20,662
Remember to hover
in the moment,

570
00:39:20,706 --> 00:39:24,405
my tortured tin-foil hatters.

571
00:39:24,449 --> 00:39:27,103
I think we all could learn
to appreciate the day...

572
00:39:27,147 --> 00:39:29,541
- Ugh.
- Stop and smell the roses.

573
00:39:29,584 --> 00:39:31,064
[groans]

574
00:39:31,107 --> 00:39:34,589
Let's all drink deeply
in the nectar of life.

575
00:39:34,633 --> 00:39:36,939
Signing off.

576
00:39:39,551 --> 00:39:46,035
[indistinct
computerized voices]

577
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,342
Hey, babe?

578
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,300
You hear that?

579
00:39:52,215 --> 00:39:55,523
[computerized voices continue]

580
00:39:57,482 --> 00:39:59,788
Hello?

581
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:05,490
[loud ringing]

582
00:40:05,533 --> 00:40:07,796
Aah! What the fuck?

583
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:12,061
[groans]

584
00:40:12,105 --> 00:40:14,542
Ray?

585
00:40:16,544 --> 00:40:17,937
What's that?

586
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,374
Never mind.
Are you okay?

587
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:24,030
Maybe you should take a break.

588
00:40:24,073 --> 00:40:25,553
Earth to Ray.

589
00:40:26,598 --> 00:40:28,121
Yeah.

590
00:40:28,164 --> 00:40:29,601
I'm sorry.
What were you saying?

591
00:40:29,644 --> 00:40:31,864
Maybe you
should take a break?

592
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:34,867
You don't look so good.

593
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,738
And if you don't get out
of this black hole,

594
00:40:36,782 --> 00:40:38,914
we might never get out.

595
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:41,482
Right. Yeah.
That's probably a good idea.

596
00:40:41,526 --> 00:40:44,093
Great, 'cause I have
to show you something cool.

597
00:40:44,137 --> 00:40:47,619
But I'm gonna change first.

598
00:40:47,662 --> 00:40:50,709
Cool like the statue?

599
00:40:52,972 --> 00:40:55,409
[groans]

600
00:40:57,019 --> 00:40:59,544
I'll be there in a minute.

601
00:41:04,897 --> 00:41:08,683
[muttering]

602
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,957
I do not believe
what I just wrote.

603
00:41:23,306 --> 00:41:24,394
What is that?

604
00:41:24,438 --> 00:41:26,527
Tarot cards.

605
00:41:26,571 --> 00:41:28,877
Not those. That.

606
00:41:28,921 --> 00:41:30,966
A Ouija board.

607
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:34,056
Why? Why are you trying
to freak me out?

608
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,971
Let me read your cards,
Ray.

609
00:41:36,015 --> 00:41:37,669
I'm good.

610
00:41:37,712 --> 00:41:39,409
Please, Ray.

611
00:41:39,453 --> 00:41:41,411
Fine.

612
00:41:41,455 --> 00:41:44,023
How about you
read your own cards?

613
00:41:44,066 --> 00:41:47,548
But can you read the meanings
for the camera?

614
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:53,075
[sighs]

615
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:58,428
They call this
a six-card lay.

616
00:41:58,472 --> 00:42:00,561
[laughs]
You said "lay."

617
00:42:00,605 --> 00:42:03,216
- Maybe later if you're good.
- 'Kay.

618
00:42:03,259 --> 00:42:05,914
Maybe I'll get to finish
this time.

619
00:42:05,958 --> 00:42:07,612
And now you know
how I feel.

620
00:42:07,655 --> 00:42:11,790
The first card
is the inner child.

621
00:42:13,661 --> 00:42:15,402
The Fool.

622
00:42:15,445 --> 00:42:20,059
"The Fool represents
a free spirit of spontaneity."

623
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:26,282
The next three cards
represent consciousness.

624
00:42:30,025 --> 00:42:31,287
Flip the next one.

625
00:42:31,331 --> 00:42:35,074
The fifth card
is subconscious.

626
00:42:35,117 --> 00:42:37,729
The Devil? That's what's
in your subconscious?

627
00:42:37,772 --> 00:42:40,645
Read the meaning
in the book, Ray.

628
00:42:40,688 --> 00:42:44,953
All right. It says the Devil
card represents bondage,

629
00:42:44,997 --> 00:42:46,955
sexuality, and addiction.

630
00:42:46,999 --> 00:42:48,609
Oh, my God.

631
00:42:48,653 --> 00:42:51,612
That totally means that
I am thinking in character.

632
00:42:51,656 --> 00:42:53,396
That's amazeballs.

633
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,050
Amazeballs?
Where'd you get that one?
Acting class?

634
00:42:55,094 --> 00:42:57,749
Yeah, how'd you know?

635
00:42:57,792 --> 00:43:00,447
All right. Flip over
the last one, Miss Roxanne.

636
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:02,057
I gotta get back to writing.

637
00:43:02,101 --> 00:43:06,322
This card represents my future.

638
00:43:08,368 --> 00:43:10,631
Holy shit.
The Empress.

639
00:43:10,675 --> 00:43:13,112
What the hell
does that mean?

640
00:43:13,155 --> 00:43:16,942
The Empress card. The Empress
card is the card of fertility.

641
00:43:16,985 --> 00:43:18,770
Oh.

642
00:43:18,813 --> 00:43:20,249
Oh shit.

643
00:43:20,293 --> 00:43:21,816
Are we having a baby?

644
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:23,470
No, no.

645
00:43:23,513 --> 00:43:26,038
No. Not with my career
skyrocketing the way that it is.

646
00:43:26,081 --> 00:43:27,822
Babe, nuh-uh. We are not
having sex ever again.

647
00:43:27,866 --> 00:43:29,302
You keep that in your pants.
It's staying over there.

648
00:43:29,345 --> 00:43:31,347
All right, just calm down.
Hey, calm down.

649
00:43:31,391 --> 00:43:32,784
We're not having a baby.

650
00:43:32,827 --> 00:43:34,742
Oh, God.
I feel nauseous.

651
00:43:34,786 --> 00:43:36,570
- It's okay.
- Oh, I really do.

652
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:37,397
- I feel nauseous.
- Look, we're not
having a baby.

653
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,659
That's a sign, isn't it?

654
00:43:38,703 --> 00:43:39,878
- [breathing heavily]
- It's okay.

655
00:43:39,921 --> 00:43:41,619
Look, I'll tell you what.
Hey.

656
00:43:41,662 --> 00:43:43,185
Let's read my cards.

657
00:43:43,229 --> 00:43:45,971
I'm sure they won't
even be close to the truth.

658
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,235
Come on.

659
00:43:51,411 --> 00:43:55,241
This is a three-card lay.

660
00:43:55,284 --> 00:43:59,898
The final card, slave,
is your future.

661
00:43:59,941 --> 00:44:05,251
See? No, see, I told you
not to bring evil shit
in the house.

662
00:44:05,294 --> 00:44:07,209
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was just kidding.

663
00:44:07,253 --> 00:44:10,169
Honey, it was a joke.
I stacked the deck.

664
00:44:10,212 --> 00:44:11,649
Oh, great.
Real funny.

665
00:44:11,692 --> 00:44:12,998
Now I'm not going to be able
to sleep tonight.

666
00:44:13,041 --> 00:44:14,826
That's really funny.
It's not funny.

667
00:44:14,869 --> 00:44:17,219
No, but, babe,
I was just kidding.

668
00:44:17,263 --> 00:44:20,179
By the way, there'll be
no sex in this house.

669
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,892
Lilly.

670
00:44:37,936 --> 00:44:41,940
You and or Miss Roxanne
need to chill.

671
00:44:45,378 --> 00:44:46,640
All right.

672
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:49,121
Balls are gonna need
an ice pack.

673
00:45:29,596 --> 00:45:31,293
Lilly.

674
00:45:31,337 --> 00:45:33,252
There's someone out here.

675
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:46,700
Lilly. Lilly.

676
00:45:51,096 --> 00:45:52,793
Lilly.

677
00:45:54,534 --> 00:45:56,666
Lilly.

678
00:46:10,637 --> 00:46:12,421
Lilly?

679
00:46:13,683 --> 00:46:15,250
Are you hungry?

680
00:46:15,294 --> 00:46:17,557
[animal growls]

681
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,821
Oh...
not the giblets, babe.

682
00:46:20,865 --> 00:46:22,083
You don't-- You don't want...

683
00:46:22,127 --> 00:46:23,519
[hisses]

684
00:46:26,871 --> 00:46:28,133
Ugh.

685
00:46:31,876 --> 00:46:33,791
Uh, babe...

686
00:46:46,978 --> 00:46:50,111
[groans]

687
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:01,906
Oh, shit.

688
00:47:06,301 --> 00:47:08,086
Did you make coffee?

689
00:47:08,129 --> 00:47:11,350
No milk.

690
00:47:13,656 --> 00:47:16,007
I don't feel well.

691
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:19,706
Morning sickness.

692
00:47:19,749 --> 00:47:21,795
Oh, ha ha.

693
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,928
- Maybe if you didn't
keep me up all night.
- What do you mean?

694
00:47:23,971 --> 00:47:26,626
- I said no sex.
- We didn't have sex.

695
00:47:26,669 --> 00:47:28,628
Well, then who was between
my legs last night?

696
00:47:31,718 --> 00:47:33,546
Grew up, Ray?

697
00:47:33,589 --> 00:47:35,330
I-- I didn't do that.

698
00:47:35,374 --> 00:47:37,550
Oh, of course you didn't,
because that would mean

699
00:47:37,593 --> 00:47:39,204
you're having fun.

700
00:47:39,247 --> 00:47:40,596
I am fun5.

701
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,424
I'm going to shower.

702
00:47:42,468 --> 00:47:44,818
You've no sense of humor.

703
00:47:47,386 --> 00:47:51,869
I'm fun. Try me.

704
00:47:51,912 --> 00:47:54,567
Tell me I'm not fun.
You're not fun.

705
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:57,570
I'm a lot of fun.

706
00:47:57,613 --> 00:48:00,834
[shower running]

707
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,705
We'll see if you find it
amusing when I scare the shit

708
00:48:02,749 --> 00:48:04,229
out of you for once.

709
00:48:14,108 --> 00:48:15,762
Boo!

710
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,156
Lilly?

711
00:48:20,288 --> 00:48:22,943
Lilly, you okay?

712
00:48:22,987 --> 00:48:26,904
[speaking foreign language
in demonic voice]

713
00:48:28,688 --> 00:48:30,733
Lilly.

714
00:48:36,739 --> 00:48:38,263
- [hisses]
- [shouts]

715
00:48:40,004 --> 00:48:42,441
Aah!
What the hell?

716
00:48:42,484 --> 00:48:45,226
[laughs]

717
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:47,925
Oh, I got-- I got you.

718
00:48:47,968 --> 00:48:50,231
You know I hate clowns.

719
00:48:50,275 --> 00:48:52,842
It's a clown
from outer space.

720
00:48:52,886 --> 00:48:54,627
It's not funny.

721
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:56,368
Boo. Rah!

722
00:48:56,411 --> 00:48:59,023
- I'm gonna go work.
- You're such a pussy.

723
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,599
Hold on a second.

724
00:49:10,643 --> 00:49:13,646
You're telling us that the
lunar lander from Apollo 13

725
00:49:13,689 --> 00:49:15,996
didn't burn up
in the atmosphere?

726
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,650
That's correct.

727
00:49:17,693 --> 00:49:20,696
And the technology was used
to travel back in time?

728
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:23,221
Not back. Forward.

729
00:49:23,264 --> 00:49:27,616
How did the lander reach Earth
without blowing up?

730
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:30,489
Well, the theory is

731
00:49:30,532 --> 00:49:33,796
is that Aquarius was swept
into a time continuum,

732
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,321
a black hole
without the destruction,

733
00:49:36,364 --> 00:49:39,628
and it was recovered by
a primitive civilization.

734
00:49:39,672 --> 00:49:43,415
At that point,
they were guided by outsiders

735
00:49:43,458 --> 00:49:45,634
to create a machine

736
00:49:45,678 --> 00:49:48,028
that could transport
to another time and place.

737
00:49:48,072 --> 00:49:50,074
Outsiders, Doc?

738
00:49:50,117 --> 00:49:52,467
Oh, you mean like aliens?

739
00:49:52,511 --> 00:49:55,079
Wow.

740
00:49:55,122 --> 00:49:58,560
Now a word from our sponsors,
my tortured tinfoil hatters.

741
00:49:58,604 --> 00:50:03,348
"Click a seer if you want
to be seen and have a session."

742
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:04,653
There we go.

743
00:50:04,697 --> 00:50:09,267
Ah, nice to see you.
Come into my den.

744
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:11,486
We will talk.

745
00:50:12,879 --> 00:50:15,534
- Must be a Jesus sale.
- Come.

746
00:50:15,577 --> 00:50:19,277
I have a special
right now just for you.

747
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:22,062
Welcome to Mystic Mama.

748
00:50:22,106 --> 00:50:25,065
- Look who it is.
- My friend,

749
00:50:25,109 --> 00:50:29,504
I see dark and stormy nights
in your future.

750
00:50:30,897 --> 00:50:33,552
You want
to change your luck?

751
00:50:33,595 --> 00:50:38,513
Give me a call.
Mystic Mama at your services.

752
00:50:38,557 --> 00:50:40,254
[laughs]

753
00:50:51,613 --> 00:50:53,963
God, that chick's freaky.

754
00:50:56,836 --> 00:51:00,144
This is the exact moment
I should not be here.

755
00:51:00,187 --> 00:51:02,276
Shh.

756
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:05,975
We are here to travel
across the great divide.

757
00:51:06,019 --> 00:51:07,412
Oh, brother.

758
00:51:07,455 --> 00:51:10,023
We will travel through
the needle of time,

759
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,504
space and dimension.

760
00:51:12,547 --> 00:51:16,464
It's inconceivable,
theoretically impossible.

761
00:51:16,508 --> 00:51:19,380
Raymond,
you should join us.

762
00:51:19,424 --> 00:51:21,600
It's Ray.
And I'm good over here.

763
00:51:21,643 --> 00:51:24,864
The power of three
is a safer energy.

764
00:51:24,907 --> 00:51:27,823
Yeah, see,
I'm the camera guy.

765
00:51:27,867 --> 00:51:28,955
Ray.

766
00:51:30,652 --> 00:51:33,133
Okay. All right, fine.

767
00:51:33,177 --> 00:51:35,614
When I have bad dreams tonight
and can't write tomorrow,

768
00:51:35,657 --> 00:51:37,311
somebody is getting
their ass kicked.

769
00:51:37,355 --> 00:51:39,487
Are you drunk?

770
00:51:39,531 --> 00:51:42,011
No. You're drunk.

771
00:51:42,055 --> 00:51:43,970
You have bad dreams?

772
00:51:44,013 --> 00:51:46,581
We have to sleep
with a nightlight on.

773
00:51:46,625 --> 00:51:48,148
I have a vivid imagination.

774
00:51:48,192 --> 00:51:50,324
It makes me a better writer.

775
00:51:50,368 --> 00:51:51,499
Oh, does it?

776
00:51:51,543 --> 00:51:54,241
Sometimes I dream
with my eyes ajar

777
00:51:54,285 --> 00:51:56,287
and they
play mischief on me.

778
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:59,333
Night light helps.
There, I said it.

779
00:51:59,377 --> 00:52:03,990
He dreams of horned people
watching him while he sleeps.

780
00:52:04,033 --> 00:52:06,297
Why do they watch you?

781
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:08,995
Oh, can we keep this
about Lilly please?

782
00:52:09,038 --> 00:52:10,866
Her acting job.

783
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:13,434
So we just put our fingers
on the oracle like this?

784
00:52:13,478 --> 00:52:15,654
That is correct, Lilly.

785
00:52:15,697 --> 00:52:17,046
Ray.

786
00:52:19,832 --> 00:52:23,662
Close your eyes,
take a deep breath,

787
00:52:23,705 --> 00:52:26,273
let go of the tension
of the day.

788
00:52:26,317 --> 00:52:28,014
What about the tension
of the night?

789
00:52:28,057 --> 00:52:29,842
Shut the fuck up.

790
00:52:29,885 --> 00:52:31,757
Deep breathing.

791
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:36,327
Release control as we control
nothing in this universe

792
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:38,807
and we are but
an existential leaf

793
00:52:38,851 --> 00:52:41,506
floating in the wind
of time.

794
00:52:41,549 --> 00:52:44,378
Breathe in and out.

795
00:52:47,425 --> 00:52:49,122
Ray,
why did you let go?

796
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,385
- Did you move it?
- No.

797
00:52:51,429 --> 00:52:53,126
What about you, Yoga?

798
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,824
Raymond, it's normal
to feel awkward

799
00:52:55,868 --> 00:52:57,217
in times of enlightenment.

800
00:52:57,261 --> 00:52:58,827
Did you fucking
move it or not?

801
00:52:58,871 --> 00:53:00,568
Ray, be nice.

802
00:53:00,612 --> 00:53:04,398
I can assure you the oracle
glided without my influence.

803
00:53:04,442 --> 00:53:05,660
Okay, I'm out.

804
00:53:05,704 --> 00:53:08,228
- Ray!
- No, don't "Ray" me.

805
00:53:08,272 --> 00:53:10,404
I didn't sign up
for incantations

806
00:53:10,448 --> 00:53:13,494
or spiritual channeling,
whatever the hell that is.

807
00:53:13,538 --> 00:53:15,235
If you let go now,

808
00:53:15,279 --> 00:53:17,803
we may not be able
to control the portal.

809
00:53:17,846 --> 00:53:19,587
So?

810
00:53:19,631 --> 00:53:21,807
If we can't control the portal,
anything can pass through.

811
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:24,157
Evil can make its way.

812
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,158
No, Ray.

813
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:26,855
Okay, fine.

814
00:53:26,899 --> 00:53:31,033
Can we just hurry up and
close the door or whatever.

815
00:53:31,077 --> 00:53:35,168
Put your hands on the oracle.
We will close the portal.

816
00:53:36,474 --> 00:53:38,127
Whoa, Lilly,
hands on the thing.

817
00:53:38,171 --> 00:53:39,868
Aah!

818
00:53:41,305 --> 00:53:43,220
[bones cracking]

819
00:53:44,873 --> 00:53:47,659
[Southern accent]
You should have thought
of that before I caught you.

820
00:53:47,702 --> 00:53:49,008
Who are you?

821
00:53:49,051 --> 00:53:50,749
Who am I, witch?

822
00:53:50,792 --> 00:53:52,316
What can we do for you?

823
00:53:52,359 --> 00:53:53,882
Shut your mouth.

824
00:53:53,926 --> 00:53:56,015
This is none of your business.

825
00:53:56,058 --> 00:53:57,321
[laughs]

826
00:53:59,845 --> 00:54:02,151
Time to pay the piper.

827
00:54:02,195 --> 00:54:03,283
The what now?

828
00:54:03,327 --> 00:54:04,415
[gasps]

829
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:11,073
Come here, boy, I'm gonna
split your skull in two.

830
00:54:11,117 --> 00:54:12,423
[bones cracking]

831
00:54:12,466 --> 00:54:14,076
[screams]

832
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,992
Jesus, Lilly.
Lilly!

833
00:54:17,036 --> 00:54:19,865
Are you okay?

834
00:54:19,908 --> 00:54:21,997
Oh...

835
00:54:23,434 --> 00:54:24,478
What happened?

836
00:54:24,522 --> 00:54:26,350
You okay?

837
00:54:26,393 --> 00:54:27,525
I'm fine.

838
00:54:27,568 --> 00:54:29,396
I think
you're overdoing it.

839
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:32,138
You're working too hard.

840
00:54:32,181 --> 00:54:34,575
Just get some rest, okay?

841
00:54:34,619 --> 00:54:36,273
Our baby needs sleep.

842
00:54:36,316 --> 00:54:38,013
You're a jerk.

843
00:54:38,057 --> 00:54:39,798
I got a bit
of writing to do.

844
00:54:39,841 --> 00:54:41,713
My book needs nursing.

845
00:54:41,756 --> 00:54:45,325
[sighs]
Besides, who can sleep now?

846
00:54:45,369 --> 00:54:48,110
I love you.

847
00:54:48,154 --> 00:54:51,723
"His long journey
into the wild

00:54:51,766 --> 00:54:53,420

all for naught

I think someone's
in the house.

She's not even there.

866
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:40,239
You can open your eyes.
No one's going to be there.

00:57:40,282 --> 00:57:43,024
You're just gonna go to bed.

Mm-hmm.

Hey, yo, by the way, that
hidden camera statue thing,

875
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:37,992
that shit's dope.

876
00:58:38,036 --> 00:58:40,212
For real. Well done.
Where'd you get that shit?

877
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:41,779
Oh, my girl got it
from a flea market.

878
00:58:41,822 --> 00:58:44,738
Hmm. Word.

00:58:44,782 --> 00:58:48,481
It's, like, some weird, like,
indigenous shit, huh?

Where's my candy?

882
00:58:52,398 --> 00:58:54,400
- Tony "C" says hi.
- Mm.

883
00:58:54,443 --> 00:58:56,097
Did you tell him
what the camera can do?

884
00:58:56,141 --> 00:58:58,535
Oh, yeah,
so it's motion activated.

885
00:58:58,578 --> 00:59:00,101
It tilts. It pans.

886

It can even zoom.

some privacy please?

to record everything.

00:59:40,141 --> 00:59:42,274
Lilly on computer:
So, guys, I'm off to the Con.

898
00:59:42,317 --> 00:59:45,799
Don't forget to get your tees
and your selfies

899
00:59:45,843 --> 00:59:48,019
with your favorite
Box Girl Lilly

900
00:59:48,062 --> 00:59:51,152
at booth 323.

901
00:59:52,676 --> 00:59:55,374
[exhales]
Okay. Here we go.

902
01:00:04,035 --> 01:00:06,211
Yeah! Oh, my God.

903
01:00:06,254 --> 01:00:08,343
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

904
01:00:13,522 --> 01:00:16,308
Okay.
What are you doing?

905
01:00:16,351 --> 01:00:17,788
What does it look like
I'm doing?

906
01:00:17,831 --> 01:00:20,094
And you call me
the crazy one.

907
01:00:20,138 --> 01:00:21,922
What?
You back to normal now?

908
01:00:21,966 --> 01:00:24,011
What the hell
are you talking about?

909
01:00:24,055 --> 01:00:25,491
Really?

910
01:00:25,534 --> 01:00:26,710
Look, I've got
character work to do,

911
01:00:26,753 --> 01:00:28,320
so kill your bugs.

912
01:00:28,363 --> 01:00:30,365
Especially the ones
inside your head.

913
01:00:30,409 --> 01:00:33,281
And please have the camera
ready to roll in ten minutes.

914
01:00:33,325 --> 01:00:34,500
Mm-mm. I'm done.

915
01:00:34,543 --> 01:00:35,675
What?

916
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:37,721
I can't do it anymore.

917
01:00:37,764 --> 01:00:39,505
My followers are coming back,
Ray.

918
01:00:39,548 --> 01:00:41,594
They're responding
to my content.

919
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,901
No.
All this social media stuff,

920
01:00:43,944 --> 01:00:47,121
whatever,
it's making you crazy, okay?

921
01:00:47,165 --> 01:00:48,732
And I'm not gonna be
a part of it anymore.

922
01:00:48,775 --> 01:00:51,952
My director says that
this could be my big break.

923
01:00:54,215 --> 01:00:56,478
Please.

924
01:00:58,219 --> 01:00:59,612
Okay.

925
01:01:08,752 --> 01:01:10,710
Dr. Ulrich:
They were guided by outsiders

926
01:01:10,754 --> 01:01:12,799
to create a machine

927
01:01:12,843 --> 01:01:15,106
that could transport
to another time and place.

928
01:01:15,149 --> 01:01:18,065
Juice: I always wanted
to travel back in time.

929
01:01:18,109 --> 01:01:20,154
But this future
doesn't look so bright.

930
01:01:22,635 --> 01:01:25,682
Dr. Ulrich:
The cost of traveling from
one dimension to another

931
01:01:25,725 --> 01:01:27,727
comes at a price.

932
01:01:27,771 --> 01:01:29,511
Juice:
Like a blood sacrifice.

933
01:01:29,555 --> 01:01:33,646
Well, glyphs indicate
that only their death

934
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,735
allows a rebirth.

935
01:01:35,779 --> 01:01:38,651
Juice: You hear that,
paranormalists?

936
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:41,175
Rebirth.

937
01:01:51,011 --> 01:01:53,535
[static]

938
01:02:38,842 --> 01:02:43,194
[thunder rumbling]

939
01:02:51,724 --> 01:02:54,727
[baby crying]

940
01:03:34,419 --> 01:03:37,552
Aah!

941
01:04:16,374 --> 01:04:17,810
I don't know
what the hell happened.

942
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:21,248
I was writing
and the juices were flowing,

943
01:04:21,292 --> 01:04:23,250
and the next thing I remember,

944
01:04:23,294 --> 01:04:26,819
I wake up on the floor.

945
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,312
Is this thing
really necessary?

946
01:04:42,922 --> 01:04:44,358
It's to catch bad dreams.

947
01:04:44,402 --> 01:04:46,491
It's for your protection.

948
01:04:46,534 --> 01:04:49,233
Carrying the statue
to the bathroom with you now?

949
01:04:49,276 --> 01:04:51,104
That's what we're doing?

950
01:04:51,148 --> 01:04:52,845
It's my inspiration, Ray.

951
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:56,370
Well, speaking of inspiration,

952
01:04:56,414 --> 01:04:58,459
I got some pages done.

953
01:04:58,503 --> 01:05:00,505
- You wanna read 'em?
- Not now.

954
01:05:00,548 --> 01:05:03,508
I see. So it's okay
for you to be creative,

955
01:05:03,551 --> 01:05:05,771
but as soon as I wanna show you
some of my stuff, it's...

956
01:05:05,814 --> 01:05:07,599
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

957
01:05:07,642 --> 01:05:09,253
What's going on? Hey.

958
01:05:09,296 --> 01:05:11,646
Hey.

959
01:05:11,690 --> 01:05:13,953
What's up?
What's happening?

960
01:05:13,997 --> 01:05:16,216
[sniffs]
I'm losing fans.

961
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:18,871
They're gonna
demonetize my site.

962
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:20,655
And I'm gonna be cut
from the cast.

963
01:05:20,699 --> 01:05:22,831
No. Babe, no. Hey.

964
01:05:22,875 --> 01:05:25,138
You're doing great.
You're amazing.

965
01:05:25,182 --> 01:05:26,705
No. Baby.

966
01:05:26,748 --> 01:05:29,577
Now, look, don't worry
about reading my stuff.

967
01:05:29,621 --> 01:05:31,884
You can read it whenever.

968
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:33,842
I'm sure it's good.

969
01:05:33,886 --> 01:05:36,802
Thanks.

970
01:05:36,845 --> 01:05:39,326
I need you
to film everything, Ray.

971
01:05:39,370 --> 01:05:41,067
I mean, no matter what.

972
01:05:41,111 --> 01:05:42,808
I need you
to keep the camera rolling.

973
01:05:42,851 --> 01:05:46,246
Okay-- Hey, I'll--
I'll film everything.

974
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:49,771
- Everything?
- Yeah. I promise.

975
01:05:49,815 --> 01:05:51,251
Okay?

976
01:05:51,295 --> 01:05:54,385
But you gotta
keep me out of it.

977
01:05:54,428 --> 01:05:57,344
All right?
Just the camera guy.

978
01:05:59,564 --> 01:06:01,653
Great, because, well,

979
01:06:01,696 --> 01:06:03,655
Angela's coming tomorrow
for another session,

980
01:06:03,698 --> 01:06:06,353
so make sure the camera's
fully charged.

981
01:06:10,444 --> 01:06:12,794
Angela.

982
01:06:12,838 --> 01:06:15,101
Fantastic.

983
01:06:15,145 --> 01:06:18,452
May the darkest journeys
turn bright.

984
01:06:20,019 --> 01:06:22,891
Cannot believe I let you
talk me into this again.

985
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:28,419
Oh, my God.
It tastes like fecal matter.

986
01:06:30,638 --> 01:06:33,032
We would like to give thanks

987
01:06:33,076 --> 01:06:35,513
for this special night.

988
01:06:35,556 --> 01:06:38,646
We open our arms
to the mystics.

989
01:06:38,690 --> 01:06:41,910
We open our arms
to the unknown.

990
01:06:41,954 --> 01:06:45,001
We open our hearts
freely to contact you,

991
01:06:45,044 --> 01:06:50,615
the all-present, everywhere
spirit of the night.

992
01:06:58,231 --> 01:07:01,147
Spirit, who do you seek?

993
01:07:02,192 --> 01:07:07,023
R... A... Y.

994
01:07:07,066 --> 01:07:08,589
Okay.

995
01:07:08,633 --> 01:07:10,461
Ray, it wants you.

996
01:07:10,504 --> 01:07:13,507
Yeah, well, tell whoever it is
Ray's not home.

997
01:07:17,294 --> 01:07:19,078
[hisses]

998
01:07:20,471 --> 01:07:21,602

[screaming, bones cracking]

1000
01:07:27,913 --> 01:07:29,958
[Southern accent]
Get inside my gut, Ray.

1001
01:07:30,002 --> 01:07:31,482
What is your name, spirit?

1002
01:07:31,525 --> 01:07:33,179
Silence.

1003
01:07:35,355 --> 01:07:36,878
Come here, boy.

1004
01:07:36,922 --> 01:07:38,489
Babe, I love you,

1005
01:07:38,532 --> 01:07:39,925
but you're really
freaking me out right now.

1006
01:07:39,968 --> 01:07:41,709
Maybe I can help.

1007
01:07:41,753 --> 01:07:44,277
What is it that you want
from Ray?

1008
01:07:49,543 --> 01:07:51,284
[cracks neck]

1009
01:07:51,328 --> 01:07:54,070
Okay. All right. Look, babe,
you're taking this method shit

1010
01:07:54,113 --> 01:07:55,462
way too far.

1011
01:07:55,506 --> 01:07:57,638
Shut your mouth, cunt.

1012
01:07:57,682 --> 01:08:00,902
You're the blackwater leech
that feeds off people

1013
01:08:00,946 --> 01:08:04,123
without a memory of doing so.

1014
01:08:04,167 --> 01:08:07,039
And he finished
his Earthly...

1015
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:09,781
with an ungrateful
swig of content.

1016
01:08:09,824 --> 01:08:12,000
Ow! Lilly, what the hell?

1017
01:08:12,044 --> 01:08:14,568
Hell? Not exactly, boy.

1018
01:08:14,612 --> 01:08:16,135
That really hurt.

1019
01:08:16,179 --> 01:08:18,137
Could you please stop
slapping me?

1020
01:08:18,181 --> 01:08:19,530
[groans]

1021
01:08:19,573 --> 01:08:21,487
You like being slapped,
don't you, clown?

1022
01:08:21,532 --> 01:08:23,533
No, I don't like
being smacked.

1023
01:08:23,577 --> 01:08:27,799
Yeehaw! I think
the catfish likes it.

1024
01:08:27,842 --> 01:08:29,540
You like it,
bottom feeder?

1025
01:08:29,583 --> 01:08:31,019

to get inside my God dang--

1040
01:09:25,465 --> 01:09:29,381
Ray,
I want to eat your heart.

Ray...

1044
01:10:18,823 --> 01:10:20,346
Lilly?

1045
01:10:22,043 --> 01:10:24,219
Angela?

1046
01:11:04,041 --> 01:11:05,565
Just close your eyes.

1047
01:11:05,609 --> 01:11:09,003
Open them, and you're
gonna be back in bed.

1048
01:11:09,047 --> 01:11:12,180
[laughs]

1049
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:19,144
Just close your eyes,

1050
01:11:19,187 --> 01:11:20,493
and when you open them,

1051
01:11:20,537 --> 01:11:23,409
you're gonna be back in bed.

1052
01:11:36,379 --> 01:11:40,077
[wood knocking, clattering]

1053
01:11:43,951 --> 01:11:46,344
You feel that?

1054
01:11:47,825 --> 01:11:50,130
Aah!

1055
01:11:52,264 --> 01:11:54,571
Aah!

Oh, God.

Aah!

1059
01:12:15,418 --> 01:12:18,725
It's not there.
It's not there. It's not there.

1060
01:12:18,769 --> 01:12:21,337
It's not there.

1061
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:25,166
It's not--

1066
01:13:05,468 --> 01:13:07,731
Why you leaving it there?

1067
01:13:10,210 --> 01:13:12,518
Well, good morning.

1068
01:13:12,562 --> 01:13:15,173
How you feel?
'Cause I feel like shit.

1069
01:13:17,001 --> 01:13:18,481
Would have been nice to know

1070
01:13:18,523 --> 01:13:21,005
that we were gonna trip
on cosmic tea last night.

1071
01:13:24,704 --> 01:13:27,490
What, nothing?

1072
01:13:27,532 --> 01:13:30,362
You just get to drug me
with some strange woman

1073
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:33,409
and I'm supposed to be
okay with this shit?

1074
01:13:37,717 --> 01:13:39,589
Something's been
going on here too,

1075
01:13:39,632 --> 01:13:40,851
and don't tell me
I'm dreaming.

1076

I'm not dreaming.

1077
01:13:42,374 --> 01:13:44,071
Got these bites
all over my back.

1078
01:13:44,115 --> 01:13:46,770
Shit's itchy as hell.

1079
01:13:48,206 --> 01:13:50,600
You know, every time you start
to do this method acting shit,

1080
01:13:50,643 --> 01:13:53,037
you get all bipolar
and crazy on me.

1081
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:55,039
I don't appreciate it.

1082
01:13:55,082 --> 01:13:58,564
There is a long list
predating the pyramids.

Juice: You're talking
south of the border.

1085
01:14:02,525 --> 01:14:04,483
You know, there's evidence
to suggest that--

1086
01:14:04,527 --> 01:14:06,005
that time and space travel

1087
01:14:06,050 --> 01:14:08,139
had been integrated
into the spirit world.

1088
01:14:08,182 --> 01:14:10,097
Juice: You hear that,
paranormalists?

1089
01:14:10,141 --> 01:14:13,710
Aliens and ghosts
travel in time.

[ominous music]

1091
01:14:29,856 --> 01:14:31,945
Hey, babe.

1092
01:14:40,606 --> 01:14:43,696
Need any organs lately?

1093
01:14:46,177 --> 01:14:49,528
Some wild stuff today.

1094
01:14:53,010 --> 01:14:54,490
Think you got this charac--

1095
01:14:54,532 --> 01:14:57,101
Oh, characters, down.

1096
01:15:01,105 --> 01:15:03,455
You're amazing.
You know that?

1097
01:15:04,804 --> 01:15:09,853
I know-- I know it's been
a crazy week, but...

1098
01:15:09,896 --> 01:15:12,856
I just wanna let you know
that I'm proud of you.

1099
01:15:16,599 --> 01:15:20,166
Well, goodnight,

1103
01:16:04,647 --> 01:16:07,563
You're all a bunch of assholes.
You know that?

1104
01:16:08,912 --> 01:16:13,090
Mm. Yeah, Lilly bird.

Hey, Lilly?

1107
01:16:18,050 --> 01:16:19,923
Think your director's calling.

1108

[ringing continues]

1109
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:22,752
Roxanne?

1110
01:16:24,318 --> 01:16:26,625
Babe, you want me
to draw you a bath?

1111
01:16:26,669 --> 01:16:28,496
Maybe it'll make you
feel better?

1112
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:31,587
[speaking indistinct]

1113
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:33,763
- Mm.
- No.

1114
01:16:33,806 --> 01:16:35,547
I'm just gonna put it over there
so it doesn't get wet.

1115
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:37,027

- Oh. Oh. Okay.

1116
01:16:37,070 --> 01:16:38,942
I'm just gonna put it
right there

1117
01:16:38,985 --> 01:16:40,334
so it doesn't get wet,
okay?

1118
01:16:40,378 --> 01:16:42,728
Come here.

How's it hangin', brah?

You're watching, aren't you?
She won't talk.

1128
01:17:21,811 --> 01:17:24,552
Just want to say aces

1129
01:17:24,596 --> 01:17:26,076
Look, tell me something.

1130

Have you noticed anything...
odd with Lilly?

1131
01:17:29,383 --> 01:17:30,950
What you talking about,
Willis?

1132
01:17:30,994 --> 01:17:33,910
Like, she won't go anywhere
without that damn statue.

1133
01:17:33,952 --> 01:17:36,347
Yo, you being kind of
aggressive and shit, Ray.

Okay. Yeah--
Have you seen any footage

1135
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:40,394
that's out of the ordinary?

1136
01:17:40,438 --> 01:17:42,353
A phantasm.

1137
01:17:42,396 --> 01:17:45,398
A demon.
[laughs]

1138
01:17:45,443 --> 01:17:47,487
Demon?
Why would you say that?

It's you who we worried about.

to be paid more.

1151

We ain't got the money.
You know what I'm saying?

1152
01:18:58,646 --> 01:19:00,039
The shit's Hollywood.
You feel me?

Great.

Babe,

Could you please just let me
know if you see something?

01:19:09,701 --> 01:19:12,182
I'm really--
I'm really worried about her.

01:25:36,566 --> 01:25:37,915
Angela:
I'm fine.

1249
01:25:37,958 --> 01:25:40,918
All right, suit yourself.

1250
01:25:41,962 --> 01:25:45,227
On the phone, you said
he has not been herself.

1251
01:25:45,270 --> 01:25:48,143
Yeah. I don't-- yeah, ever--
ever since she's been meditating

1252
01:25:48,186 --> 01:25:49,796
with that stupid statue.

1253
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:53,191
This statue
is the God of Fertility.

1254
01:25:53,235 --> 01:25:57,064
Fertility. No, no,
the internet said it was
the God of, uh, Space Travel.

1255
01:25:57,108 --> 01:25:58,936
But not in the sense
that you think.

1256
01:25:58,978 --> 01:26:02,983
It is the exploration
of traveling one's being

1257
01:26:03,027 --> 01:26:06,073
into another
between time and space.

1258
01:26:06,117 --> 01:26:09,076
Angela:
As if you were being born
into another.

1259
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:13,429
Then the traveler impregnates
their soul's energy

1260
01:26:13,472 --> 01:26:15,170
into the vessel.

1261
01:26:15,213 --> 01:26:18,912
- The vessel.
- The person.

1262
01:26:18,956 --> 01:26:20,653
B-But what happens
to the person then?

1263
01:26:20,697 --> 01:26:23,874
- Their life force is expunged.
- Expunged?

1264
01:26:23,916 --> 01:26:26,529
However, it takes a while
before complete reproduction.

1265
01:26:26,572 --> 01:26:28,357
What do you mean, takes--
So how long?

1266
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:32,187
It depends on the will
and the openness of the host.

1267
01:26:32,230 --> 01:26:34,580
There's gotta be a way--
Like, is there a way to stop it?

1268
01:26:34,624 --> 01:26:37,279
At any moment,
the surrogate's totality

1269
01:26:37,322 --> 01:26:40,237
can reverse
the transposition or possession.

1270
01:26:40,282 --> 01:26:42,109
Okay. Come again?

1271
01:26:42,153 --> 01:26:43,850
It can be stopped
at any time.

1272
01:26:43,894 --> 01:26:45,635
Okay, then, yeah, stop it.

1273
01:26:45,678 --> 01:26:46,940
I cannot.

1274
01:26:46,984 --> 01:26:48,290
Well, why the fuck not?

1275
01:26:48,333 --> 01:26:51,554
It's up to the person
closest to her.

1276
01:26:51,597 --> 01:26:53,338
So I-- Okay, great.

1277
01:26:53,382 --> 01:26:55,035
So what can I do
to stop it?

1278
01:26:55,079 --> 01:26:57,212
Do normal things.

1279
01:26:57,255 --> 01:27:00,127
Alter her path
back to commonality.

1280
01:27:00,171 --> 01:27:03,478
Then once the person
refutes the foreign entity,

1281
01:27:03,522 --> 01:27:06,482
it can go back
to a normal life.

1282
01:27:06,525 --> 01:27:08,527
Okay.

1283
01:27:08,571 --> 01:27:12,531
However,
most are mentally too forgone
to make the distinction

1284
01:27:12,575 --> 01:27:14,707
unless it's from
an outside force.

1285
01:27:14,751 --> 01:27:18,494
Outside force?

1286
01:27:18,537 --> 01:27:21,018
You, my friend.

1287
01:27:23,847 --> 01:27:25,762
Right.

1288
01:27:25,805 --> 01:27:29,287
Made your favorite.

1289
01:27:29,331 --> 01:27:32,116
You know I'm not very good
in the kitchen,

1290
01:27:32,159 --> 01:27:36,032
but I followed your recipe,
so hope it's okay.

1291
01:27:39,732 --> 01:27:41,907
Did you try the... wine?

1292
01:27:41,952 --> 01:27:43,910
Well...

1293
01:27:45,737 --> 01:27:49,481
Come on, babe.
Your fans are watching.

1294
01:27:49,525 --> 01:27:52,223
You gotta eat something.

1295
01:27:54,746 --> 01:27:59,012
You know, you're always
trying to get in my pants.

1296
01:28:00,753 --> 01:28:03,539
Well, now's your chance.

1297
01:28:07,804 --> 01:28:10,197
Who's in there?

1298
01:28:12,374 --> 01:28:14,853
Is it Miss Roxanne?

1299
01:28:16,769 --> 01:28:19,511
Huh?

1300
01:28:22,688 --> 01:28:25,691
Ow. Ow.

1301
01:28:30,434 --> 01:28:32,307
Hope you guys
enjoyed that one.

1302
01:28:41,184 --> 01:28:43,230
I got so carried away
the other night.

1303
01:28:43,273 --> 01:28:45,189
It was all for theater.

1304
01:28:45,232 --> 01:28:47,278
And the fans.
[whispers] And the fans.

1305
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:49,846
No doubt.
How's social media treating you?

1306
01:28:49,889 --> 01:28:52,892
Like the mob that kills if they
don't get what they want.

1307
01:28:52,936 --> 01:28:54,459
That seance was the bomb.

1308
01:28:54,503 --> 01:28:55,895
I'm getting killer fans.

1309
01:28:55,939 --> 01:28:58,115
Well, at least one of us
will get the bonus.

1310
01:28:58,157 --> 01:29:02,162
And that chair and table trick
worked perfectly.

1311
01:29:02,206 --> 01:29:04,121
I know!

1312
01:29:04,164 --> 01:29:08,386
All we have to do is stick
these furniture pads on.

1313
01:29:10,519 --> 01:29:12,347
Aah!
Amazeballs.

1314
01:29:12,389 --> 01:29:14,261
[cracking]

1315
01:29:14,305 --> 01:29:16,829
Ooh, that's gross.

1316
01:29:16,873 --> 01:29:20,702
Sound is a powerful tool.

1317
01:29:20,746 --> 01:29:23,139
To fool.
[laughs]

1318
01:29:23,183 --> 01:29:25,055
- How much time do we have?
- Two hours.

1319
01:29:25,098 --> 01:29:26,925
Ooh.

1320
01:29:26,969 --> 01:29:29,538
So during the seance I want you
to scare the hell out of him.

1321
01:29:29,581 --> 01:29:31,278
Yes.

1322
01:29:31,322 --> 01:29:33,803
You're gonna grab one
of these fizzy tablets,

1323
01:29:33,846 --> 01:29:36,196
bend over,
pop it in your mouth,

1324
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:38,416
let the fizz do the work.

1325
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:40,723
Oh, that was so fun.

1326
01:29:40,766 --> 01:29:42,725
I know.

1327
01:29:42,768 --> 01:29:45,728
I think we went a little far
with the psychedelic tea.

1328
01:29:45,771 --> 01:29:47,991
Eh, whatever.
Ray will get over it.

1329
01:29:48,034 --> 01:29:49,384
He's a little paranoid.

1330
01:30:02,701 --> 01:30:04,834
This shit's gotta stop.

1331
01:30:06,487 --> 01:30:07,924
You need to get
the heck out of here

1332
01:30:07,967 --> 01:30:11,884
and leave Lilly alone.

1333
01:30:11,928 --> 01:30:14,496
Understand each other?

1334
01:30:18,195 --> 01:30:20,284
Good.

1335
01:30:20,327 --> 01:30:22,808
[distant thud]

1336
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:27,334
[camera beeps]

1337
01:30:34,385 --> 01:30:36,561
[static on computer]

1338
01:30:45,222 --> 01:30:47,964
Oh, girl, those
stacked cups and plates?

1339
01:30:48,007 --> 01:30:50,357
That was an accident
waiting to happen.

1340
01:30:50,401 --> 01:30:52,011
Uh, what stacked cups
and plates?

1341
01:30:52,055 --> 01:30:55,928
Oh, shit.
Here he comes.

1342
01:30:55,972 --> 01:30:57,103
Hello?

1343
01:31:03,632 --> 01:31:06,722
[ominous music]

1344
01:31:17,862 --> 01:31:19,561
Hey, were you
talking to someone?

1345
01:31:19,603 --> 01:31:22,041
I thought I heard voices.

1346
01:31:22,085 --> 01:31:24,217
Hearing drums, too.

1347
01:31:24,261 --> 01:31:27,090
Here, you should drink
some water.

1348
01:31:30,136 --> 01:31:32,922
Damn it.
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

1349
01:31:32,965 --> 01:31:35,490
Hold on.

1350
01:31:54,987 --> 01:31:57,294
I swore I heard somebody.

1351
01:31:57,337 --> 01:32:00,036
I'm not going crazy.

1352
01:32:01,603 --> 01:32:04,954
Maybe I am going crazy.

1353
01:32:04,996 --> 01:32:07,957
[Lilly crying]

1354
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,612
Oh, babe. Oh.
Hey, don't cry.

1355
01:32:11,656 --> 01:32:14,353
Hey.
You're gonna be great.

1356
01:32:14,398 --> 01:32:16,400
And you're gonna get
so many fans from this.

1357
01:32:16,443 --> 01:32:19,446
And, you know, your director's
really lucky to have you.

1358
01:32:19,490 --> 01:32:21,536
- [laughs, cries]
- Okay?

1359
01:32:21,579 --> 01:32:24,407
- Mm-hmm.
- You just--
You just get some sleep.

1360
01:32:24,451 --> 01:32:28,717
I think... we all just need
to get some sleep.

1361
01:32:32,938 --> 01:32:36,638
I'm losing my mind.

1362
01:32:36,681 --> 01:32:38,509
[exhales]

1363
01:32:38,553 --> 01:32:41,164
[shoes thud on floor]

1364
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:12,064
[electricity crackling]

1365
01:33:37,219 --> 01:33:39,744
[bones cracking]

1366
01:33:45,010 --> 01:33:46,664
Aah!

1367
01:33:46,708 --> 01:33:48,971
[laughs]

1368
01:34:12,777 --> 01:34:15,258
[animal growls]

1369
01:35:18,364 --> 01:35:21,150
[breathing heavily]

1370
01:35:29,505 --> 01:35:32,552
[heart beating]

1371
01:35:52,442 --> 01:35:54,966
[animal growls]

1372
01:35:55,010 --> 01:35:59,536
[laughs]

1373
01:36:02,931 --> 01:36:05,368
Okay, Ray, I'm off to set.

1374
01:36:05,411 --> 01:36:07,544
Despite my fanbase,
they still want me.

1375
01:36:07,587 --> 01:36:10,547
So, well, I must have
done something right.

1376
01:36:11,896 --> 01:36:14,464
[groans]

1377
01:36:14,507 --> 01:36:17,075
Ew, that doesn't feel right.

1378
01:36:17,119 --> 01:36:19,599
I better not get my period.

1379
01:36:19,643 --> 01:36:22,602
Ray. Honey.

1380
01:36:22,646 --> 01:36:25,780
Ray. Don't pout.

1381
01:36:25,823 --> 01:36:27,651
I love you.

1382
01:36:28,870 --> 01:36:31,568
- [doorbell rings]
- Lilly: Coming.

1383
01:36:31,611 --> 01:36:34,092
That's my co-star
and my driver.

1384
01:36:34,136 --> 01:36:36,834
I will call you
when I get to my trailer.

1385
01:36:36,878 --> 01:36:39,619
[groans]

1386
01:36:42,318 --> 01:36:45,712
You know, maybe you should
go outside, get some sun.

1387
01:36:45,755 --> 01:36:48,106
Bye, babe.

1388
01:36:49,193 --> 01:36:50,848
- Hi.
- Hey, Angie.

1389
01:36:50,892 --> 01:36:52,675
- Are you ready for this?
- Oh, honey.

1390
01:36:52,719 --> 01:36:54,156
Lilly: Ugh.
Thanks for everything.

1391
01:36:54,199 --> 01:36:55,635
Angela:
Of course.

1392
01:36:55,679 --> 01:36:57,115
Lilly:
Girl, I don't feel good.

1393
01:36:57,159 --> 01:36:58,682
Like, I don't-- I haven't
gotten my period yet.

1394
01:36:58,725 --> 01:37:00,466
I don't know what it is.
But it's all right.

1395
01:37:00,510 --> 01:37:02,338
Oh, hey.

1396
01:37:02,380 --> 01:37:04,688
I'm so excited.

1397
01:37:04,731 --> 01:37:07,734
Angela: [Southern accent]
Why, hello, Sheriff.
What can we do for you?

1398
01:37:07,778 --> 01:37:10,215
Lilly: [Southern accent]
Yes, what can we do
for you, Sheriff?

1399
01:37:10,259 --> 01:37:11,956
Sheriff:
[clears throat]

1400
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,915
Sorry for showing up
unannounced and all,

1401
01:37:13,958 --> 01:37:16,700
but there's been
some complaints in town

1402
01:37:16,743 --> 01:37:20,182
about strange happenings
at your place at night.

1403
01:37:20,225 --> 01:37:22,401
Angela:
What kinda strange things?

1404
01:37:22,445 --> 01:37:24,925
Lilly: Would you care
for some tea?

1405
01:37:24,969 --> 01:37:27,450
Sheriff:
Something about an out of towner
staying with you ladies.

1406
01:37:27,493 --> 01:37:29,887
Uh, heard a little thing.

1407
01:37:29,931 --> 01:37:32,672
Angela:
I see.

1408
01:37:32,716 --> 01:37:37,068
Talks of witchcraft
and blood sacrifices.

1409
01:37:37,112 --> 01:37:38,809
Lilly:
Witchcraft?

1410
01:37:38,853 --> 01:37:42,594
Angela:
Blood sacrifices?

1411
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:44,771
[coughs]

1412
01:37:44,815 --> 01:37:46,904
Whoa.
That's got some kick.

1413
01:37:46,948 --> 01:37:49,646
[laughs]
Best tea in all of Texas.

1414
01:37:50,647 --> 01:37:52,083
He is so sweet to Nina.

1415
01:38:01,223 --> 01:38:03,746
[gurgles]

1416
01:38:12,059 --> 01:38:15,367
[laughs]

1417
01:38:15,411 --> 01:38:17,152
You like that?

1418
01:38:17,195 --> 01:38:18,893
Yeah.
Yeah, it looked good.

1419
01:38:18,936 --> 01:38:22,112
[laughs]
I'm a master.

1420
01:38:22,157 --> 01:38:25,682
Angela: ...An ungrateful swig
of content.
