WOMAN: OK Scott,
what happened to you?

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,500
How'd you burn yourself?

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:21,420
SCOTT: Um... I was
playing with some fire and um...

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,940
I had petrol
'cause it was a rainy day

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,980
and, uh, the fire was...

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,080
the petrol was
too close to the fire

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,680
and um... the petrol
caught on fire,

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,420
then I panicked.

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,940
Then the um... petrol can
slipped over

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,880
and it went a real big line
of fire on the thing

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,620
and I jumped in it
and it burnt my legs.

14
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,120
And then I just ran down
to the hose

15
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,660
and I turned it on
and I put it full speed

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,500
and I just put the fire out.

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,340
Then I just ran next door.

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,380
WOMAN: How's
your treatment been?

19
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,900
You've had skin grafts,
haven't you?

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,860
- SCOTT: Yes, three.
- And has that been OK?

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,820
Yes, quite well.

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,780
It used to be very itchy
but it's OK now.

23
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,500
WOMAN: Will you be
playing with fire again?

24
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,700

what happened to you?

26
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,220
How'd you burn yourself?

27
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,980
I was going up to my bedroom
and...

28
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,140
um, I wanted to see -
I had this light

29
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,420
and I had this coloured
sky rocket

30
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,260
and I wanted to see
if the wick went quick

31
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,900
so I lit it.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,500
And it went fast
and I tried to make it go out

33
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,700
but I couldn't, and...

34
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,780
I... tried...

35
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,660
I broke the stick
trying to get it out

36
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,780
but I couldn't and it
made holes through my jeans.

WOMAN: You'll be in here for
a while longer, won't you?

38
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,060
Yeah, about a week.

play with firecrackers anymore?

40
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,020
Yes.

WOMAN: Don't you think you've
learned a lesson from this?

42
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,680
Yes, but I'm still
playing with it.

talked to the bank again?

No, it means we can buy it.

What are you doing?

889
01:09:27,979 --> 01:09:29,919
What?

890
01:09:30,018 --> 01:09:31,518
Get that off.

What?

I'm not dressed like a clown.
I'm dressed nice.

895
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:44,240
You are not going to
embarrass me today.

No.

01:09:56,018 --> 01:09:57,399
Go.

You're not going to ruin today.

I need to say goodbye to Dad,
though.

903

Good afternoon! How are you?
Please have a seat.

would you like to go?

- To America.
- To America?

918
01:11:39,938 --> 01:11:43,037
Yep, absolutely. And when
were you thinking of going?

919
01:11:43,139 --> 01:11:44,438
Now.

you didn't cry.

doesn't mean I'm not hurting.

- Was it a .22?
- Yeah, it was a .22.

1046
01:20:26,098 --> 01:20:29,759
OK. You've got to understand these things have
got a bit more kick than a .22.
- Yeah.

- And was the .22 semi-auto?
- No.
