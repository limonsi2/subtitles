1
00:00:14,154 --> 00:00:18,175
Don't let yourself go

2
00:00:21,943 --> 00:00:25,693
As everybody cries

3
00:00:29,797 --> 00:00:33,649
And everybody hurts

4
00:00:34,641 --> 00:00:38,164
Sometimes

5
00:00:44,025 --> 00:00:46,640
And folks, if I've learned
one thing, it's this.

6
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,320
You can't let your
disability hold you back.

7
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,420
You gotta wear it like a badge of honor.

8
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,320
You gotta go out there and
you gotta say, world, this is me.

9
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,420
This is who I am in all my
glory and I'm here to win.

10
00:00:57,421 --> 00:01:02,490
Don't let yourself go.

11
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,594
Cause everybody cries.

12
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,100
But sometimes...

13
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,260
Sometimes everything is wrong.

14
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,840
Here at San Diego Trust,

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,080
we're a cross-credit union.

16
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,300
We don't have customers or clients.

17
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,590
We have members.

18
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,470
Family members.

19
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,380
And that's... exciting.

20
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:54,860
Yeah, big time.

21
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,920
And there's nothing more
exciting than Christmas Bonus Day.

22
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,260
Our busiest day of the year.

23
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:06,240
The day hard-working union
members get to turn their labor...

24
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,000
Tomorrow, we put the trust...

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The San Diego Trust.

26
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:25,900
That's it.

27
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:26,600
All right, that's it?

28
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:26,860
Yeah?

29
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,280
Yeah.

30
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:27,420
Good.

31
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:28,620
Nice.

32
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,260
Powerful.

33
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,340
Thank you, yeah.

34
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:30,820
Okay.

35
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,260
Good stuff.

36
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,400
Right, back to work.

37
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,480
Back to work.

38
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,240
Right.

39
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,220
I mean, what about the story?

40
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,761
Are you... Are you getting by?

41
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,760
Had to let Terrence go.

42
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,620
But I still open every day.

43
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,380
Not sure what else to do with
myself now that Betty's gone.

44
00:02:51,381 --> 00:02:52,381
Well...

45
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,470
Earl, I'm...

46
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,350
I'm really sorry, but if you can't pay...

47
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,351
we're gonna have to foreclose.

48
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,330
I understand.

49
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,240
Okay.

50
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,030
What I can do...

51
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,351
is I can hold onto this
paperwork until after the holiday.

52
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,480
Now, that should buy you enough
time for Betty's social security...

53
00:03:27,481 --> 00:03:28,761
and retirement to clear probate.

54
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,580
Now, I can't promise that
it'll save the store, but...

55
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,420
that should keep you in your house.

56
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,520
I appreciate that.

57
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,920
Yeah.

58
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,431
Let me walk you out, okay?

59
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,690
I'm so sorry again, Earl.

60
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:51,770
I mean, I can't even imagine what it's like
to lose someone after 50 years of marriage.

61
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,990
Time don't matter.

62
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,310
Would've hurt just as bad
if I lost her the day we met.

63
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,671
She brought the sunshine in my life.

64
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,250
I know.

65
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:06,910
You know what I mean?

66
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,750
Yeah.

67
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,270
Totally.

68
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:32,410
Hey, Nate.

69
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,250
Thank you.

70
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:34,250
Oh, sorry.

71
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:34,990
Hey, what's up?

72
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:35,970
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

73
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:36,150
What?

74
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,830
Oh, no, I'm... Jesus.

75
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:37,650
Oh, that's fine.

76
00:04:37,775 --> 00:04:39,056
I mean, I can take care of that.

77
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,450
No, no, really, you don't have to.

78
00:04:40,451 --> 00:04:42,531
I'm actually really good
at getting stains out of...

79
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,530
You actually don't have to.

80
00:04:43,531 --> 00:04:43,950
I'm good.

81
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,650
I'll take care of it.

82
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:45,490
I promise.

83
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,211
Everything's... Do not worry.

84
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,390
I, uh...

85
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:51,410
I...

86
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:52,590
I got it.

87
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:53,430
I just didn't... I'll go.

88
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:53,930
Sorry.

89
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,130
Oh.

90
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:58,970
Real smart.

91
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:00,810
Idiot.

92
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:03,610
Yeah, come in.

93
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:04,170
Hey.

94
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:04,850
Sherry.

95
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:05,130
Hey.

96
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:05,870
Hi.

97
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,430
Hi.

98
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,470
Um...

99
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:11,210
Am I just so very fired?

100
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,587
Listen, I know I've only
worked here for four

101
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,450
months, but I really feel
like I have a lot to contribute.

102
00:05:15,451 --> 00:05:15,730
No, no, no, no.

103
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:16,190
You're not fired.

104
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,910
You're definitely...
Definitely not fired.

105
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,410
Are you sure?

106
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:18,610
Yeah.

107
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,646
I feel like I at least owe
you, like, a new shirt.

108
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,130
Oh, this shirt?

109
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:21,350
No.

110
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:21,930
No, no.

111
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,911
This... This is... This is...

112
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,570
This is the worst shirt I have.

113
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:26,610
Okay.

114
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,411
Well, maybe I could take you to lunch?

115
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,270
Uh... Yeah.

116
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,930
Uh... No, actually.

117
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:31,130
Sorry.

118
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,190
I brought mine today.

119
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:32,730
Are you sure?

120
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:33,050
So I'm... I'm okay.

121
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:34,730
Okay.

122
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:35,150
Yeah.

123
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:35,770
No pressure.

124
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:36,270
Okay.

125
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,370
But if you change your mind, let me know.

126
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,251
Uh... Hey.

127
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:54,860
Hey.

128
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,360
Uh...

129
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,520
You know what?

130
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,700
I'm in.

131
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,860
Okay.

132
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:01,560
Cool.

133
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,420
Leave in ten?

134
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,100
Yeah.

135
00:06:03,101 --> 00:06:04,160
Sounds good.

136
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,880
Looking forward to it.

137
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,800
Don't say that so loud.

138
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,140
Welcome back, honey.

139
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,536
I see you brought a friend this time.

140
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:18,760
Yeah.

141
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,520
This is Nate.

142
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,260
Hey there, Nate.

143
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,500
What can I get you?

144
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,121
Oh, you know, just a... Just
a... A milkshake, please?

145
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:24,640
Vanilla?

146
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,060
Milkshake?

147
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,231
No, you don't want any food?

148
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,420
There's really good sandwiches.

149
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:28,421
Really good sandwiches?

150
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,861
Uh... Nah.

151
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:30,780
I'm good.

152
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Okay.

153
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,420
Um... Then I'll have... Oh.

154
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,080
Please tell me that you're
not out of the cherry pie.

155
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:37,880
It's your lucky day.

156
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,580
Got one.

157
00:06:38,581 --> 00:06:38,880
One left.

158
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,240
Nice.

159
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,260
Yeah.

160
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,040
So...

161
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,240
What's your deal?

162
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,500
Uh...

163
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,580
My deal?

164
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,800
Yeah.

165
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,237
You know, you're
just always, like, I don't

166
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,061
know, in your office, and you
never come out to the happy hours.

167
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,840
Uh... I don't... I don't...
I don't really know.

168
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,260
You know, I'm, um...

169
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,171
I guess I'm just not
really a very social person.

170
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:08,960
Okay.

171
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:09,720
Yeah.

172
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,100
So...

173
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,320
Do you have a girlfriend?

174
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:12,640
No.

175
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,640
No, I don't.

176
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,440
Um... Not... Not right now.

177
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:15,820
Yeah.

178
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,300
Are you on the apps?

179
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:17,700
No.

180
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,400
God, no.

181
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,200
Why not?

182
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:19,780
Really?

183
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,200
No.

184
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:20,640
You look great.

185
00:07:21,005 --> 00:07:22,636
I could take a profile
picture of you right now.

186
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,500
The reindeer tie would slay.

187
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,160
Oh, okay.

188
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,300
All right.

189
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,980
Oh, thank you very much.

190
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,220
Yeah.

191
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,700
Enjoy.

192
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,371
Holler if you need anything.

193
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,800
Thank you.

194
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,480
Mm.

195
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Mm-hmm.

196
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:37,460
Mm.

197
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,120
Mm.

198
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:38,860
Oh, my God.

199
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,880
This is so good.

200
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,460
Do you want some?

201
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,320
Oh, no.

202
00:07:42,321 --> 00:07:42,460
No.

203
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,020
I'm okay.

204
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:43,520
I'm fine.

205
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:43,860
No.

206
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,760
It's... It's... I'm good.

207
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,460
It's so good.

208
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,360
I'm really... I'm
really sure I'm fine.

209
00:07:47,361 --> 00:07:47,560
It's so good.

210
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:47,860
Totally.

211
00:07:47,861 --> 00:07:48,700
It's... Just do it.

212
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:49,240
I can't.

213
00:07:49,241 --> 00:07:50,241
I can't.

214
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:51,880
I'm sorry.

215
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,020
I... I just can't
have, uh, any pie.

216
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,080
What do you mean you can't?

217
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,160
Uh...

218
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,160
Okay.

219
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,440
Um...

220
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:08,831
I have a genetic disorder.

221
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,280
Oh.

222
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,100
Okay.

223
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,960
Go on.

224
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:17,540
Oh.

225
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,480
Yeah.

226
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,660
Um...

227
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,470
It's called, uh, CEPA.

228
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,620
Um...

229
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:26,380
Congenital insensitivity
to pain with anhidrosis.

230
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,760
Um...

231
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,441
It affects my nervous system.

232
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,300
And it, uh...

233
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,720
Basically makes it so I can't feel pain.

234
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,300
Um...

235
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,620
Or hot or cold.

236
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,160
And that's why I can't, uh, have the pie.

237
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,520
Or any solid food.

238
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,020
Really.

239
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,021
Because, um...

240
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,580
Unknowingly, I could bite my tongue off.

241
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:49,820
Oh.

242
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,700
The coffee earlier.

243
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,340
Yeah.

244
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:52,600
No.

245
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,120
I couldn't feel that at all.

246
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,040
Uh... Holy shit.

247
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,300
Yeah.

248
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:58,900
You're a superhero.

249
00:08:59,060 --> 00:08:59,320
No.

250
00:08:59,321 --> 00:08:59,840
Yeah.

251
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,500
Sure.

252
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:00,920
Yeah.

253
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I, uh...

254
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,781
I have the power to step
on a nail and... and not

255
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:09,280
know until my shoe
fills up with, uh... blood.

256
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:09,840
Right.

257
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,420
Yeah.

258
00:09:10,421 --> 00:09:12,520
Didn't... think about that.

259
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,860
True story, by the way.

260
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,580
We were at the aquarium.

261
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,380
My mom fainted.

262
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:15,720
Jesus.

263
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,940
Yeah.

264
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,170
My parents, they, um...

265
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:21,540
They basically spent my entire
childhood at... at the hospital.

266
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,453
And then when they
found out that the average

267
00:09:24,465 --> 00:09:26,620
life expectancy for
my condition was, um...

268
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,320
25...

269
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,980
They sort of... locked me up.

270
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,760
I'm sorry.

271
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:35,960
No.

272
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,960
Hey, I'm... You know.

273
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,040
I'm, uh...

274
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm still kicking.

275
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,180
Yeah.

276
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:41,320
Okay.

277
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,760
I mean, I hear all that.

278
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,576
But does that really mean that you can't
have just, like, a little bite of this pie?

279
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:48,840
No.

280
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,340
I can't.

281
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,380
I mean...

282
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,361
Like I said, I... I...

283
00:09:52,765 --> 00:09:55,161
I could bite my tongue off and... You're
not gonna bite your tongue off, Nate.

284
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,860
This is the best cherry
pie on the West Coast.

285
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,120
Okay?

286
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,160
I swear to God.

287
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,800
Listen.

288
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,980
If anything goes wrong, I'm right here.

289
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,080
Okay.

290
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,900
Okay?

291
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:17,560
Here?

292
00:10:17,561 --> 00:10:18,060
Here we go.

293
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,000
Yep.

294
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:19,900
Taking a bite.

295
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,060
Open your mouth.

296
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,600
Okay.

297
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,580
Remember, chew softly.

298
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,120
Yep.

299
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,880
Uh huh.

300
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,160
Let the magic happen.

301
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,130
Uh huh.

302
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,790
God, that is so good.

303
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,490
That is so good.

304
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,200
Oh, my God.

305
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,630
Oh, my God.

306
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,010
I told you.

307
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,310
What?

308
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,170
This is pie?

309
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:52,670
Yeah.

310
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,590
This is pie?

311
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:54,110
This is pie.

312
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,111
Pie's good!

313
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:56,490
Congratulations.

314
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,670
Whoa!

315
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,270
What are you doing later tonight?

316
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,830
Look, she invited me out to this art show.

317
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,810
I'm just not gonna go.

318
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:13,690
I think I'm just gonna stay here
and we'll play and it'll be fine.

319
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,870
You've been talking
about this girl for months.

320
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,206
You're basically in love with her.

321
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,190
I mean, if I were you,
I'd be all over that shit.

322
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,750
Yeah, man, but I'm not like you.

323
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,930
I'm not cool. I don't drive a Harley.

324
00:11:22,931 --> 00:11:25,250
I'm not this hunky guy with a man bun.

325
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,790
Again, it's a short pony.

326
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,210
But, dude, that stuff is not
why I do well with women.

327
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:31,246
Does it help? Of course it does.
I'm not gonna lie.

328
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,450
But confidence is king.

329
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,680
I feel like I'm gonna mess it up somehow.

330
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,230
What's the worst that can happen?

331
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,930
You wind up alone in your
living room playing video games?

332
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,850
You're already there, my guy.

333
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,690
What do you have to lose?

334
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,860
Nate, you're gonna die.

335
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
What? Oh, shit, sorry. Um...

336
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,900
Okay.

337
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:56,920
No, no, no.

338
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,520
That was actually really impressive.

339
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,006
Hey, man, I'm sorry.
My head's not in this right now.

340
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,076
Can I call you back a little later?

341
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,696
Oh, sure, yeah. I'll just go fuck myself.

342
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,720
Okay, thanks.

343
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,660
My friends call me a loser

344
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,200
Cause I'm still hanging around

345
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:47,690
I pray for you Boo.

346
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:48,190
Hey.

347
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:48,710
Hey.

348
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:49,730
Hi.

349
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,350
Hey, you came. You're here.

350
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:51,810
Yeah, no.

351
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,110
No, of course. My, you know, my schedule.

352
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,150
Cleared up and, uh... Cool.

353
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:56,470
Yeah.

354
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,310
Well, I'm glad you're here.

355
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:57,970
Yeah, of course.

356
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,130
What do you think?

357
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:00,430
These are yours?

358
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:01,610
Mm-hmm.

359
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,310
These are awesome.

360
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,750
Thank you.

361
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,460
Who are they?

362
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,400
Uh, they're from my therapy group.

363
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,730
Some cutters, some suicidal.

364
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,750
Everyone's kind of
recovering in their own way.

365
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,120
Jesus, you run a therapy group, too?

366
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:16,670
Oh.

367
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:17,950
No, no, no.

368
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:18,670
I attended.

369
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:19,410
Oh.

370
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:20,730
Oh.

371
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:22,290
Damn.

372
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,110
I'm so sorry.

373
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:23,590
I'm sorry.

374
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:23,770
I'm sorry.

375
00:13:23,771 --> 00:13:24,630
No, no, no, no.

376
00:13:24,631 --> 00:13:25,210
Don't, don't.

377
00:13:25,211 --> 00:13:26,290
I did not mean... I apologize.

378
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,370
I, I... You're okay.

379
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:27,830
It's fine.

380
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:28,070
Okay.

381
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,270
I'm not ashamed of it.

382
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:29,490
Okay.

383
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:29,710
Here.

384
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:30,130
God.

385
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,051
You have a... Oh, my God.

386
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:34,650
I sold one.

387
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,270
Yeah.

388
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:36,430
Why are you so surprised?

389
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:39,710
Come on.

390
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,750
Oh, yeah.

391
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,890
Um, so, where'd you grow up?

392
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,510
Well, I grew up in Tucson.

393
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:51,710
And Cedar City.

394
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,670
And Sacramento.

395
00:13:53,671 --> 00:13:53,750
And Sacramento.

396
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,630
Hmm.

397
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,070
I was in foster care.

398
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:57,830
Okay.

399
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:58,230
Yeah.

400
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:58,390
Yeah.

401
00:13:58,391 --> 00:14:00,970
So, I just kind of bounced
around until I was 12.

402
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,470
And then I got adopted.

403
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:07,750
And I had, you know, uh, my own
room and a big brother and parents.

404
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,770
And it was all very exciting.

405
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:10,870
That's amazing.

406
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,050
Do you still see him a lot?

407
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,290
Not really.

408
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:14,610
No.

409
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,970
Um, it wasn't exactly a loving household.

410
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,190
Oh, okay.

411
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:20,630
Yeah.

412
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:20,990
Yeah.

413
00:14:21,105 --> 00:14:22,290
So, I, uh...

414
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:23,730
Let's see.

415
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:23,890
I grew up in the mountains.

416
00:14:23,891 --> 00:14:24,250
And I got adopted when I was 18.

417
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,250
And I've been on my own ever since.

418
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,330
Uh, man, that is tough.

419
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,470
I'm sorry.

420
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,130
It's fine.

421
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,820
You know, if you, uh,
don't have anybody you

422
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,950
care about, it's harder
to get hurt, right?

423
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,050
Novocaine?

424
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,240
Holy shit.

425
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,900
It is you.

426
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:46,920
I...

427
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,380
This is fucking wild.

428
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:51,260
I thought you'd be dead by now.

429
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,160
Yeah.

430
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,320
Well...

431
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:55,500
I'm... I'm not.

432
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:55,940
Yeah.

433
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:56,280
Yeah.

434
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,920
Oh, good for you, bro.

435
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,640
Just like old times, huh?

436
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,860
It's fucking Nova King!

437
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,600
And he's not fucking dead!

438
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,260
So what was that?

439
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,500
Uh...

440
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,680
Uh, that was, um, some asshole
that I went to middle school with.

441
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,400
And what did he call you? Nova King?

442
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,520
Yeah, uh, it was...

443
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,280
It was just some dumb
nickname they gave me.

444
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:29,493
You know, once the other kids
found out about my condition,

445
00:15:29,505 --> 00:15:32,500
they basically started kicking
my ass pretty much daily.

446
00:15:33,505 --> 00:15:37,480
Figuring it didn't matter, you know,
cause I couldn't feel any of it, so...

447
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,760
I'm sorry.

448
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,100
But...

449
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,380
I gotta say, as far as nicknames go...

450
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,320
Nova King?

451
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,540
Kinda badass.

452
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,060
No.

453
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:55,680
Really?

454
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:56,600
Yeah.

455
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:56,980
Yeah.

456
00:15:56,981 --> 00:15:57,080
Okay.

457
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,520
Well, thank you.

458
00:15:58,770 --> 00:15:59,770
But they didn't think so.

459
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,060
It... it... it was fine.

460
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,000
Sorry.

461
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,980
Um, excuse me for one second.

462
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,060
Just gonna...

463
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,340
Hey.

464
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,540
Yeah?

465
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,830
What does it deal with the alarm?

466
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,640
Um...

467
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:21,320
I gotta set one of these every three
hours or else my bladder might explode?

468
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,840
... ...

469
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,601
... ... ...

470
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,880
...

471
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,501
... ...

472
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,940
Hey.

473
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,440
How'd you two... get along?

474
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,560
We... really are. He's hilarious!

475
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,860
You know what?

476
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,300
I think you two just need
to let bygones be bygones.

477
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,520
What do you say?

478
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,040
What do you mean?

479
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,160
Shots!

480
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:13,980
Duh! Come on, my treat.

481
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,470
Yeah, sure, why not?

482
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,760
Okay, great.

483
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,200
Hey, and uh, no hard feelings, right?

484
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,480
Yeah, sure.

485
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,380
Feelings, get it?

486
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,440
So clever.

487
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,020
Fucking die.

488
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,480
There you go.

489
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,980
Thank you.

490
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,480
Here you go.

491
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,570
What the fuck was that?

492
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,690
What is that?

493
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,350
Leap and Larry's Five
Alarm Ghost Pepper Sauce.

494
00:17:56,555 --> 00:17:57,555
Do you like it?

495
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,030
Yeah.

496
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:01,330
It's Novocaine's favorite.

497
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,450
Hey, should we, um,

498
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
head back to your place?

499
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,270
You can put those on his tab.

500
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:12,450
Done.

501
00:18:15,075 --> 00:18:16,110
That was amazing.

502
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,350
That was...

503
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,170
You're a very good actor.

504
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,430
Oh, thank you.

505
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:23,770
Oh my god, that's gonna be killing
him thinking that I'm taking you home.

506
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,410
You bet you are.

507
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:29,130
Wait, what?

508
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,920
Have you

509
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,420
really read all these books?

510
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,460
I don't get out much.

511
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,520
Really?

512
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,550
You've even read the

513
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:48,241
Mayo Clinic A to Z Health Guide?

514
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:51,000
When you can, um, entail
yourself without realizing

515
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,321
that, um, you know, first aid
knowledge comes in pretty handy.

516
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,640
Touché.

517
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,290
You're a real renaissance man, Nathan Cain.

518
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:05,210
I never would have guessed.

519
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
...

520
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,481
... ...

521
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,100
... I'm sorry? No.

522
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,580
No, I'm sorry.

523
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,500
It's okay.

524
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,920
You sure? Yeah.

525
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,520
...

526
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,761
... ... ...

527
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,941
... ... ... ... ... ... ...

528
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,550
...

529
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:10,790
...

530
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:13,950
...

531
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,451
... ... ... ...
... ... ... ... ...

532
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,168
I was a teenager, and as I got better at it, I
kind of got more sucked into it, and it was, uh, it

533
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:36,280
was just like, um, this secret world, this, this
other life that, you know, was actually an adventure.

534
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,190
It's a story, isn't it?

535
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:43,670
Yeah. Yeah, you could,
you could call it that, yeah.

536
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,470
How does it end?

537
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:52,870
I don't know. I'm still figuring that out.

538
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,270
So I have a question.

539
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:10,310
If you can't feel pain, does that also
mean that you can't feel pleasure?

540
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,900
I mean, uh, I think I can.

541
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,100
Can you feel this?

542
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,900
I feel a little bit of pressure.

543
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,630
How about this?

544
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:10,780
Definitely feel like something gorgeous.

545
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,400
It's not just you, Nate.

546
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,760
Everybody is hiding something.

547
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,661
I think... I think
we're all just...

548
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,060
...looking for someone we can show it to.

549
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:23,610
...in a maze that you're making me feel

550
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:29,510
My heart's in overdrive what?

551
00:23:29,511 --> 00:23:28,900
!

552
00:23:28,901 --> 00:23:31,821
...while you're behind
the steering wheel ...

553
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,380
...touching you

554
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,420
touching me ...straight

555
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,920
touching you God,
you touch my soul

556
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,260
oh

557
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,280
just don't tell me

558
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:08,930
So last night was life-changing.
No, no, no. Way too big.

559
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:11,510
Uh, last night was really great.

560
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:16,270
Uh, last night was... amazing.

561
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:26,650
Ah, gentlemen! Love the outfits!

562
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,490
How can I help you?

563
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:30,050
We're here to make a withdrawal.

564
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:37,070
Get down! Get down! Get down!

565
00:24:37,071 --> 00:24:38,071
Get the fuck down!

566
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:38,350
Whoa!

567
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:39,910
Get on the ground!

568
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,050
Get down!

569
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,250
All right, everyone.

570
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:46,790
Do exactly as we say, and you'll
all live to open up your prisons.

571
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:48,490
Fools!

572
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:50,130
On the ground in front of you!

573
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:51,850
Hands behind your heads!

574
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:55,010
Mr. Manager!

575
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:57,290
You're up.

576
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,440
Alarm's tripped!

577
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,840
Three minutes.

578
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,740
Open the vault.

579
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,660
I won't be able to open it in time.

580
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,820
Forty-five.

581
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,980
Open the vault, or I will kill you.

582
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,740
No.

583
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,800
I-I won't do it.

584
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:26,630
You won't do it?

585
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,330
They ain't called my bluff.

586
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,520
Ask! You! Very!

587
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,920
Captain Kringle?

588
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,040
Huh?

589
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,100
Your beard.

590
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,010
Sorry, buddy.

591
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,190
You saw my face.

592
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,590
Assistant Manager!

593
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:12,920
Two minutes.

594
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,840
One-thirty!

595
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:29,110
Hey.

596
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,130
Hey, now.

597
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,210
Look at me.

598
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,170
Say the fucking numbers.

599
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:35,870
What?

600
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:36,930

Take a bath!

617
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,960
He's got the oven.

618
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,120
Let's move!

619
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,000
Grab a fucking hostage!

620
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,440
Sorry, sweetheart.

621
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,380
Come on.

622
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:08,070
Alright, three, two, out!

623
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,020
Okay.

624
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,580
Okay.

625
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,480
Let's take it easy.

626
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,580
Nobody needs to get hurt.

627
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,760
Go.

628
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,600
Sherry.

629
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,880
You're gonna be okay.

630
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:13,980
Alright?

631
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,040
Keep pressure on it.

632
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,380
32 and 34, back up.

633
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,440
Eight minutes out.

634
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,960
Eight minutes?

635
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:30,930
Don't.

636
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:33,650
I'm sorry.

637
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:34,670
I'm sorry.

638
00:30:34,845 --> 00:30:35,845
I will bring it back.

639
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:39,150
Oh my god.

640
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:12,390
It's not about the money.

641
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:14,170
What is important is that we had fun.

642
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Fuck, he's still coming.

643
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,580
What's your fucking call, genius?

644
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:52,720
Split up.

645
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,820
Meet back at the shop.

646
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:54,880
Get on the highway.

647
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:55,580
No, no, no, no.

648
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,540
I ain't gettin on the highway.

649
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,220
Get on the highway!

650
00:31:57,221 --> 00:31:57,980
I wanna stay there.

651
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:58,980
He needs our help.

652
00:31:58,981 --> 00:31:59,981
Get away!

653
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,540
Come on.

654
00:32:03,541 --> 00:32:04,541
Which one, Sherry?

655
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,300
What the fuck?

656
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,420
Go.

657
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,860
Sorry. No, I'm sorry.

658
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,340
What are you doing?

659
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:35,820
Out of the way!

660
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,420
Fuck off!

661
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:46,130
Hey, hey, hey, look.

662
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,626
Look, man, I don't want any trouble.
I just want to know where Sherry is.

663
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:50,650
Hey.

664
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:53,150
You're not a cop?

665
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,110
Uh, no, but...

666
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,200
Come on, man, just tell me where she is.
I'll let you go.

667
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,590
Okay?

668
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:04,630
You ever fired a gun before?

669
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:09,130
Do you, uh...

670
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,620
even know where the safety is?

671
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:12,830
Mm-hmm.

672
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,070
Mm-hmm.

673
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:17,250
Hey!

674
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:18,290
Whoa!

675
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:31,200
Hey, man, I don't want to fight, okay?
I'm not that guy.

676
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,320
I just want...

677
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,780
You're fucking dead, you know that?

678
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,140
Tony, please.

679
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,260
Okay, so those are definitely third-degree,

680
00:34:09,485 --> 00:34:11,446
so you're gonna want to
run it under some cool...

681
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,320
I'm not done with you.

682
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,720
Okay, wait, hold on.

683
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:18,580
Look, I still feel like we
can get what we want here.

684
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,320
Oh, you're strong!

685
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,940
I am so sorry.

686
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,660
Oh, no.

687
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:42,690
Hey, last chance. Tell me where she is.

688
00:34:42,691 --> 00:34:42,910
Yes, sir.

689
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:43,930
Eat shit.

690
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:53,130
Okay, okay, uh...

691
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:57,130
Hey.

692
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,030
Hey, man, you okay?

693
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:17,851
You had to do it. You had to do it.

694
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:18,990
Think about it, Sherry.

695
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:21,330
Yeah.

696
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:23,290
Yeah.

697
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:42,270
Okay.

698
00:36:42,271 --> 00:36:42,450
Okay.

699
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:43,990
Okay.

700
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:45,610
Okay.

701
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:18,630
Okay.

702
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:19,410
Okay.

703
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,070
Sorry.

704
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:35,620
So, Sherry was kidnapped,
and you killed a guy in a kitchen.

705
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,460
Roscoe, just listen to me very carefully.

706
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,501
I don't have a lot of...
Oh, my God, I got shot.

707
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:39,800
What?

708
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:40,460
You got shot?

709
00:37:40,685 --> 00:37:41,380
Listen, all right?

710
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,200
I just texted you a photo of a tattoo.

711
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,439
I need you to call
around every parlor in San

712
00:37:45,451 --> 00:37:47,151
Diego and try to find
out who did the art.

713
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,751
What am I, your fucking secretary?

714
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,660
I'm not doing shit.

715
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,720
Roscoe, I wouldn't ask
if I had any other choice.

716
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:53,080
I mean, we're a team, right?

717
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:54,480
Yes, a video game team.

718
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:58,500
We've never even met in person, and now
you're involving me in a real-life murder?

719
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,516
Why don't you just call the police?

720
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,604
You know, I technically
stole a cop car, and then

721
00:38:02,616 --> 00:38:04,820
there's the whole thing
about the guy that I killed.

722
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:08,100
Fine, Jesus, I'll get you the
address, but that's it, okay?

723
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,340
Okay, thank you.

724
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,600
Thank you, bye.

725
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:25,580
Details are still trickling in, but we have
confirmed reports of multiple fatalities.

726
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:29,340
Citizens are advised to report
any suspicious activity in their area.

727
00:38:29,341 --> 00:38:32,121
But to not engage
with all suspects... Shit.

728
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,721
Bad week to quit drinking.

729
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,500
Well, quit drinking.

730
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,940
No, no.

731
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,280
I just mean it would be.

732
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,420
Detective.

733
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,200
Yeah, what do you got?

734
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,400
Three officers down.

735
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,480
One in the ICU.

736
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,780
Bank manager, DOA inside.

737
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,340
Three gunmen, two cars.

738
00:38:48,965 --> 00:38:50,166
They took a hostage with them.

739
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,201
And one additional suspect at large.

740
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,460
Additional suspect?

741
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:54,860
Yeah, the assistant manager.

742
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:57,591
He stole a cruiser and followed the gunman.

743
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:59,320
Witnesses say it's the
same guy who killed him.

744
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,340
We'll open the vault.

745
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:02,860
Could be a double cross.

746
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,340
Do we have units in pursuit?

747
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,260
No, these were the only ones in the area.

748
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,466
Calls went out at
the fifth and sixth, but

749
00:39:09,478 --> 00:39:11,320
they're spread thin
because of the holidays.

750
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:12,220
Okay.

751
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,100
Thank you, officer.

752
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,260
Thank you.

753
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:18,956
We need to get a file on
that assistant manager.

754
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:19,980
Quick.

755
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,861
Today was supposed to be an easy one.

756
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:24,980
I'm going.

757
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:25,360
Thanks.

758
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,520
I'm going.

759
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,780
Coming through, news.

760
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,480
He's on my way.

761
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,580
Come on.

762
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,060
Loans for lunch.

763
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,240
Come back later.

764
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,056
You sure you don't want me
to just call you an ambulance?

765
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:31,500
No, no, no.

766
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:32,731
I told you there's no time.

767
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,500
All right.

768
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,540
Sweet Jesus.

769
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,020
Here we go.

770
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,320
Earl, you okay?

771
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:46,040
Me?

772
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,240
Oh, yeah.

773
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,320
Just...

774
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,001
This is not what I expected today.

775
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:52,040
Hey, if it's any consolation, me neither.

776
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,160
All right.

777
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,180
All right.

778
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,280
Let me find it.

779
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,060
Huh.

780
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:03,740
Is that it?

781
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,480
Hey!

782
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:07,820
There we go.

783
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,880
All right.

784
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,150
Put some on this.

785
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,380
Just a little bit.

786
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:18,470
Just a little bit.

787
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,210
Okay.

788
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:21,770
Here we go.

789
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:24,630
Yeah.

790
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:25,670
Here we go.

791
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:26,730
See?

792
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:27,890
Good as new.

793
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:28,530
Anyway.

794
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:29,330
Oh.

795
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:30,010
Whoa.

796
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:31,330
Um...

797
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:32,990
Earl, was there...

798
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:33,970
There's...

799
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,566
There's an EpiPen in there, right?

800
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:36,710
You mind handing that to me?

801
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:38,510
What?

802
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:39,691
You allergic to something?

803
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:40,530
Uh, thank you.

804
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:40,710
No.

805
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:42,970
Uh, epinephrine is just
another form of adrenaline.

806
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:44,090
It should, uh...

807
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,110
Keep me from passing out.

808
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,670
Oh.

809
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:48,470
God.

810
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:49,750
God.

811
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,620
Yeah, that did it.

812
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,680
Okay.

813
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Uh...

814
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:58,640
Yeah.

815
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,420
All right.

816
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,460
Hey, Earl.

817
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:01,820
Thank you so much.

818
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:02,860
Sorry, this was...

819
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,220
A lot.

820
00:42:04,595 --> 00:42:05,780
You go get that girl, Nick.

821
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:09,940
Oh, hey.

822
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,200
Um...

823
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,160
Almost forgot.

824
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,520
This should, uh...

825
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:16,311
Come up with a mortgage for a while.

826
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,320
Betty always said you were a good kid.

827
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,560
Yeah.

828
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:25,750
Oh.

829
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:26,830
Oh, sorry.

830
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:28,390
All right.

831
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:29,931
Uh... I'll see you later.

832
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:31,911
You know, if I...
If I don't, uh, die.

833
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,021
You might want to launder that, by the way.

834
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,640
Uh...

835
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,420
One of our bank robbers?

836
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,040
God, I hoped so.

837
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:29,971
It would be a shame
if it was the real Santa.

838
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:34,000
Kitchen staff said a crazy
guy in a tie did all this.

839
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,200
I'm thinking that's our assistant manager.

840
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:38,900
Oh, boy.

841
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,741
Speaking of... Oh!

842
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:43,780
Got a bit of a profile on...

843
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,100
Uh...

844
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,200
Nathan Cain.

845
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:48,940
Single.

846
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:49,520
Male.

847
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:50,180
30.

848
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,480
No record.

849
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:52,580
No affiliations.

850
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:54,170
Zero traffic tickets.

851
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:58,080
An online gamer tag of Magic Nate Ball.

852
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,920
Oh, that's good.

853
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:03,420
Uh... Worked at the San
Diego Trust for six years.

854
00:44:05,105 --> 00:44:07,306
That just doesn't sound
like a Stone Cold Killer to me.

855
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,660
And yet...

856
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:11,920
Yeah.

857
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:15,511
Do you have a cell phone number for him?

858
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:16,760
I just robbed a bank.

859
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:17,880
Tell the guy.

860
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:20,751
You really think he's just
picking up his cell phone?

861
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:22,920
This is Nate speaking.

862
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,480
Hi, Nate.

863
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,596
Uh, this is Detective Barbara
Mincy of the San Diego Police.

864
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:29,620
How you doing?

865
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,801
I've... I've been... Better.

866
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:32,740
Did you catch the others?

867
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,180
Is... Is Sherry
the... The hostage?

868
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,320
Is she safe?

869
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:37,200
Yeah, well, you know,
we're working on that.

870
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:39,821
But whatever it is you're doing
isn't making her any better.

871
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,560
So if you could turn yourself and
the cash in right now... Wait, wait, wait.

872
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:42,860
Sorry.

873
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,240
Um...

874
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:47,020
Holy shit.

875
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:48,110
You think I'm in on this?

876
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:48,960
Nope, nope, Nate.

877
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:50,980
Uh, we're just following
the facts here, okay?

878
00:44:50,981 --> 00:44:51,380
Look, look, look.

879
00:44:51,381 --> 00:44:52,836
Hey, I don't give a shit about the money.

880
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:53,940
I just want to save Sherry.

881
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:54,500
Mm-hmm.

882
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:56,901
Well, that's our job to
worry about, not yours.

883
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:59,239
Yeah, well, I heard
that 75% of hostages

884
00:44:59,251 --> 00:45:01,100
who die are killed in
the first three hours.

885
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:04,300
So unless you're calling me to tell
me you found her, I'm not going to stop.

886
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,500
Sherry...

887
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:09,881
She, uh... She, uh...
Is she your girlfriend?

888
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:10,200
Yeah.

889
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,860
I mean, you know, we, we haven't necessarily
put a label on anything yet, but...

890
00:45:13,861 --> 00:45:14,080
Look, look.

891
00:45:14,081 --> 00:45:14,980
Stop it, all right?

892
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,216
I know what you're trying to do.

893
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,120
You don't give a shit about us.

894
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:17,680
No, Nate.

895
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:18,900
That's not true.

896
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,121
We just want everyone
to get home safe, okay?

897
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:24,161
I understand you care
about her, but... Do you?

898
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,481
Do you know what it's like to wait
your whole life to meet someone?

899
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:31,716
Someone who changes everything?

900
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:34,900
Who finally gives your life meaning?

901
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:38,260
Yeah.

902
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:38,860
Yeah.

903
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,320
Yeah, I do.

904
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:42,960
My daughter.

905
00:45:47,535 --> 00:45:49,183
And if your daughter
was kidnapped, would

906
00:45:49,195 --> 00:45:51,016
you wait around for
someone else to save her?

907
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,240
Or would you do it yourself?

908
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,440
All right, Nate.

909
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,720
Have it your way.

910
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,220
Got a trace on his cell.

911
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:21,300
Hey, you good?

912
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:22,460
Yeah.

913
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,560
Let's move.

914
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:32,740
...29C-47...

915
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,220
This is total fucking shit.

916
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,476
Look, there's nothing on the
scanner about your brother.

917
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,520
That means he probably lost the tail.

918
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,040
Then why the fuck ain't he here?

919
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:44,560
I don't know, okay?

920
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,240
I don't know.

921
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:45,620
I'm sorry.

922
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,720
I don't know everything.

923
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:51,221
Maybe he had to switch vehicles.

924
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:53,551
Maybe he stopped off to get some ice cream.

925
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:58,740
The point is, your fucking whining about it
isn't gonna make him show up any faster.

926
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:03,311
Watch how you're talking to me.

927
00:47:04,095 --> 00:47:06,696
You may be running point on
this, but you're not my fucking boss.

928
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,100
Hmm.

929
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:12,751
Andre, I need you to
switch up the vibe right now.

930
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,440
Because you're bombing me out.

931
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:19,900
Come on!

932
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:23,960
Ben is gonna be back in 15 minutes
and everything is gonna be fine.

933
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,700
Just keep saying it.

934
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:27,620
Everything is gonna be fine.

935
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,040
Yeah, fucking right.

936
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:39,901
No more silent treatment, huh?

937
00:47:49,175 --> 00:47:50,216
I'm sorry I hit you, okay?

938
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:54,730
Do you, um...

939
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,390
Do you wanna hit me?

940
00:47:58,050 --> 00:47:59,050
Make it even?

941
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:01,570
Fuck you.

942
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:03,590
Wow.

943
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:07,450
I do not like that tone.

944
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:09,850
I don't like it.

945
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:10,970
...

946
00:48:12,370 --> 00:48:13,491
... ...

947
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:37,390
... ...

948
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:37,930
...

949
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:39,570
...

950
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:42,430
...

951
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:45,350
... ... ... ... ... ...
... ... ... ... ... ... ...

952
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:47,210
...

953
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:48,511
... ... ... ...

954
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:52,250
...

955
00:48:52,970 --> 00:48:56,770
... Nigel? Who is Nigel?

956
00:48:58,010 --> 00:49:02,350
He was a Nigel too, wasn't he?

957
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:04,730
Nigel...

958
00:49:24,355 --> 00:49:25,716
Sounds a whole lot like an excuse.

959
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:29,681
You know how I feel about excuses.

960
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:31,350
Don't you?

961
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:35,350
You're so fucking impossible.

962
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:37,750
What's done is done.

963
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:39,330
Okay.

964
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,810
Let's just stay focused on the plan.

965
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:45,891
And we can hash all this out later
over some pina coladas in Mexico.

966
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:48,941
Those are disgusting, by the way.

967
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:52,710
It's in your teeth.

968
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:11,370
Yeah?

969
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:12,640
Hello, ma'am.

970
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:15,490
Is Zeno here?

971
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:17,826
I just need to talk with him for a second.

972
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:18,850
Sorry, customers only.

973
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:20,250
You know what?

974
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:21,611
That's actually why I'm here.

975
00:50:23,665 --> 00:50:25,226
I'm just looking to get some work done.

976
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:31,886
Looks like you've already
had some work done today.

977
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:32,910
Sorry?

978
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:34,230
Oh!

979
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:35,530
My appearance.

980
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:38,750
Well, you should see the other guy.

981
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:55,520
Okay.

982
00:50:55,521 --> 00:50:56,521
Oh.

983
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,320
I thought that was a real guy for a second.

984
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:05,150
Wait here.

985
00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:06,410
Thank you.

986
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:23,660
You.

987
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:24,980
What's good?

988
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:27,560
I'm good.

989
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:28,560
I'm... Everything's good.

990
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:29,900
Um...

991
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:31,640
I was just looking to get a tattoo.

992
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:33,980
Fuck.

993
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:35,540
What's happening with your hand?

994
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:36,800
Oh.

995
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,040
Psoriasis.

996
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:41,900
It's really, really flared up on me today.

997
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:42,480
Yeah.

998
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:43,540
All right.

999
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:45,340
So, where are we working?

1000
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:46,280
Uh, yeah.

1001
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:46,860
Just...

1002
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:48,340
Um...

1003
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,040
Right here.

1004
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:51,340
Damn.

1005
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,500
I like your tats.

1006
00:51:52,501 --> 00:51:53,100
That's good shit.

1007
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:53,580
Oh.

1008
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:54,380
Wow.

1009
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:55,140
Thank you so much.

1010
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:56,180
I, uh...

1011
00:51:56,470 --> 00:51:57,580
I like yours, too.

1012
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:58,220
Yeah.

1013
00:51:58,380 --> 00:51:59,380
So, uh...

1014
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:00,640
What you want?

1015
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:02,440
Well, I have a buddy of mine.

1016
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:03,580
Um...

1017
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:04,956
And he got this awesome tattoo.

1018
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:06,220
I want the exact same one.

1019
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,420
I think he said that he got it here.

1020
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:09,980
No shit.

1021
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:10,800
Ha.

1022
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:11,800
You know Ben.

1023
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:12,980
Ben.

1024
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:14,080
Yeah.

1025
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:15,280
Ben.

1026
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:18,920
So, um... Did you
guys serve together?

1027
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:19,580
Yeah.

1028
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:20,680
We did.

1029
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:21,780
Serve together.

1030
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:23,400
Honorably.

1031
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:24,680
Hm.

1032
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Rock on, brother.

1033
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,240
Hey, um...

1034
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:33,740
Speaking of Ben, is he still
working at the same place?

1035
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,160
I don't know.

1036
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,621
Ben doesn't talk about work.

1037
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:37,600
Classic Ben.

1038
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:38,760
Hates work.

1039
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:39,860
Hates it.

1040
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:41,960
Um...

1041
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,020
Funny story about Ben.

1042
00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:45,860
Um, you know his last name, right?

1043
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:47,140
Yeah.

1044
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:48,540
Okay.

1045
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:50,731
How would you think it's pronounced?

1046
00:52:57,930 --> 00:52:59,110
Seriously, you're gonna...

1047
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:00,850
You're gonna love this.

1048
00:53:00,851 --> 00:53:01,851
Just...

1049
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:02,970
Just say his last name.

1050
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:09,090
Why don't you say it?

1051
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:14,940
Ah.

1052
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:16,060
You know, never mind.

1053
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:18,620
It's fine.

1054
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:19,780
It's not that funny.

1055
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:22,616
Cause you know, you tell a
bad joke, you have to explain it.

1056
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:23,060
It's not good.

1057
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:23,880
Yeah.

1058
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:24,720
Give me a sec.

1059
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:25,240
Mmhmm.

1060
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:25,600
Yeah.

1061
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:26,720
Take your time.

1062
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:37,530
You know, I'm thinking that
maybe you don't know Ben.

1063
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,130
Yo, what the fuck is this?

1064
00:53:41,131 --> 00:53:41,930
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1065
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:42,190
Okay?

1066
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:43,340
Just put down the knife.

1067
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:46,330
...

1068
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:49,570
Tell me everything you
know about Ben and I'm gone.

1069
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:12,020
Let me show you how it's done.

1070
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:14,220
...

1071
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:16,500
...

1072
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:19,920
Yeah!!!

1073
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,200
...

1074
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:25,740
...

1075
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:27,701
... ...

1076
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:29,960
Oh!

1077
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:32,380
Diddle you little shit!

1078
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:32,860
...

1079
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:34,560
Fuck you, man!

1080
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:19,660
What the fuck are you doing?

1081
00:55:56,390 --> 00:55:57,390
I can't see!

1082
00:55:57,470 --> 00:55:57,650
Okay.

1083
00:55:57,910 --> 00:55:58,270
Fuck.

1084
00:55:58,570 --> 00:55:59,570
Alright, look.

1085
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:02,220
What's his name?

1086
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:04,351
Fuck you and the horse you rode in on, man.

1087
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:06,830
Okay.

1088
00:56:08,210 --> 00:56:08,570
Look.

1089
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:09,050
Look.

1090
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:10,570
Please.

1091
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:11,790
Please don't make me do this.

1092
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,430
Fucking eat shit, man.

1093
00:56:14,690 --> 00:56:15,690
Okay.

1094
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:16,190
Okay.

1095
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:17,710
This is gonna suck, are you sure?

1096
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:18,890
Fuck off.

1097
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:19,630
Okay.

1098
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:20,610
Here we go.

1099
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:20,970
No!

1100
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:22,290
Fuck!

1101
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:23,830
Hey, hey, hey!

1102
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:24,450
Just give me his name!

1103
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:25,550
Just give me his name!

1104
00:56:25,830 --> 00:56:26,830
Oh, Jesus!

1105
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:28,530
Oh, fuck!

1106
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:28,970
It's Clark!

1107
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:29,770
It's Clark.

1108
00:56:29,870 --> 00:56:30,130
Okay.

1109
00:56:30,830 --> 00:56:31,230
Clark.

1110
00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:31,650
Ben.

1111
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:32,890
Ben Clark.

1112
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:34,670
There we go.

1113
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:35,730
Is that so hard?

1114
00:56:38,310 --> 00:56:40,870
I'm giving you what you
want, then I'll just fucking go.

1115
00:56:40,970 --> 00:56:41,450
Just one second.

1116
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:42,590
One second.

1117
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:46,210
Hey there, Chad.

1118
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,601
It's Nate over at San Diego Trust.

1119
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:49,181
Glad I caught you before the holiday.

1120
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:50,230
Yeah.

1121
00:56:50,370 --> 00:56:50,610
Listen.

1122
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:52,435
I was hoping you
could run a quick credit

1123
00:56:52,447 --> 00:56:54,370
check on a new client
whose file is incomplete.

1124
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:56,270
His name is Ben Clark.

1125
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:57,991
He did serve in the military.

1126
00:56:58,070 --> 00:56:59,110
Does that narrow it down?

1127
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:01,030
Yeah.

1128
00:57:01,370 --> 00:57:01,770
Yeah.

1129
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:02,810
VA loans.

1130
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:03,390
That's him.

1131
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:06,430
You don't have any
employment on record, do you?

1132
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:09,341
How about a last-name residence?

1133
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:11,630
Yeah.

1134
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:12,190
Yeah.

1135
00:57:12,290 --> 00:57:13,290
Hold on one second.

1136
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:15,050
Okay.

1137
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:19,380
Shoot.

1138
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:19,840
God.

1139
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:20,240
God.

1140
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:21,700
Okay.

1141
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,360
Four.

1142
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:24,460
Two.

1143
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,160
North.

1144
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:29,280
Tower.

1145
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:29,960
Late.

1146
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:31,500
All right.

1147
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:32,720
Chad.

1148
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:33,840
Thank you so much, man.

1149
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:34,880
You're the best.

1150
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:36,340
Oh.

1151
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:37,120
Yeah.

1152
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:38,260
Merry Christmas to you, too.

1153
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:39,560
Go Padres.

1154
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:23,270
Something's wrong.

1155
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,586
He should definitely be here.

1156
00:58:24,610 --> 00:58:24,790
Look.

1157
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:25,710
He's got plenty of time.

1158
00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:27,070
We can't leave Toadstark anyway.

1159
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:27,930
I'm gonna check his house.

1160
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:28,830
The house he just left?

1161
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,686
Did he really spend all weekend booby-trapping
like he's Wile E. fucking Coyote?

1162
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:32,710
That house?

1163
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:33,986
You really think he's gonna go back there?

1164
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,010
Use your brain, man.

1165
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:36,190
He's my brother!

1166
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:37,370
I'm well aware of that.

1167
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:38,510
Take a half hour.

1168
00:58:38,570 --> 00:58:40,530
If he's not there, I'll
come back and we can go.

1169
00:58:42,050 --> 00:58:43,050
Andre.

1170
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:45,210
Andre!

1171
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:47,070
Don't be a fucking idiot!

1172
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:38,240
Find an Xbet and earn a bonus
of up to 100% on your first deposit!

1173
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:11,350
What is that?

1174
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:12,490
.

1175
01:00:17,350 --> 01:00:19,710
What the fuck is that? Why?

1176
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:24,610
Okay, uh...

1177
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:30,370
All right.

1178
01:01:03,850 --> 01:01:09,250
Oh, come on, really?

1179
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:20,620
Crossbow. Under the sink. Of course.

1180
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:32,881
All right, whatever. Fuck it.

1181
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:25,530
Yes. Yes.

1182
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:29,370
Yes.

1183
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:36,310
Okay, I found you.
And now I'm gonna make you...

1184
01:03:15,050 --> 01:03:19,047
What the fuck? God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God.
God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God.

1185
01:03:19,059 --> 01:03:23,126
God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God.
God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God

1186
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:24,847
...a snare trap, and
if you don't come right

1187
01:03:24,859 --> 01:03:26,606
now and cut me down,
then Sherry's gonna die.

1188
01:03:26,630 --> 01:03:27,630
I'm probably gonna die.

1189
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:30,750
Dude, you can't put that shit on me.
I'm not getting involved in this.

1190
01:03:30,770 --> 01:03:31,770
You already are, okay?

1191
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:34,871
Look, man, I'm sorry, I just...

1192
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:39,990
I don't know who else to call.

1193
01:03:41,650 --> 01:03:44,470
Maybe to you, I'm just some
random guy you met on the internet,

1194
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:47,646
but to me, all that time we spent
together, it actually meant something.

1195
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:48,670
You're...

1196
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:52,490
You're my only friend, Roscoe.

1197
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:54,130
And right now...

1198
01:03:55,550 --> 01:03:56,550
...I need you.

1199
01:03:57,710 --> 01:03:58,710
God damn it.

1200
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:00,948
Okay, look, it says
15 minutes, but I'll

1201
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,741
take the Harley and
be there in 10, alright?

1202
01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:03,910
Yes!

1203
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:05,430
Yes! Thank you, thank you so much!

1204
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:07,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah, just hang in there.

1205
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:09,091
Sorry, that wasn't a
pun, I meant it sincerely.

1206
01:04:09,610 --> 01:04:10,610
No, no, it was funny.

1207
01:04:11,130 --> 01:04:12,651
It was funny, just please hurry, okay?

1208
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:13,850
Yeah, okay, bye.

1209
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:15,390
Okay.

1210
01:04:15,610 --> 01:04:16,610
Okay.

1211
01:04:16,830 --> 01:04:17,830
Okay, 10 minutes.

1212
01:04:18,510 --> 01:04:19,510
10 minutes.

1213
01:04:20,050 --> 01:04:21,290
I can make it 10 minutes, okay.

1214
01:04:23,550 --> 01:04:24,550
Ben?

1215
01:04:24,910 --> 01:04:25,910
Oh, no.

1216
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:29,230
You're here, bro.

1217
01:04:59,330 --> 01:05:00,330
Hi.

1218
01:05:02,610 --> 01:05:03,690
Who the hell are you?

1219
01:05:04,370 --> 01:05:05,910
Uh, I'm just a thief.

1220
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:08,050
You know, just came here to, uh...

1221
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:11,750
...thieve.

1222
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:14,110
Where's my brother?

1223
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:15,750
I'm sorry, your what?

1224
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:20,270
Uh, look, man, look, I don't know
anything about anybody's brother, I'm...

1225
01:05:21,070 --> 01:05:23,923
...you know, I just
randomly picked this place

1226
01:05:23,935 --> 01:05:26,550
and, uh, well,
apparently, I picked wrong.

1227
01:05:27,650 --> 01:05:29,896
You know, most people
just have the doorbell with

1228
01:05:29,908 --> 01:05:32,350
the camera, but an indoor
snare trap, egg on my face.

1229
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:35,501
You don't look like a thief.

1230
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:39,010
Yeah, well, the best of us rarely do.

1231
01:05:42,530 --> 01:05:44,890
So you just picked this
place at random, huh?

1232
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:46,470
Yeah, yeah, just my luck.

1233
01:05:47,390 --> 01:05:48,750
Then why the fuck...

1234
01:05:50,030 --> 01:05:50,990
...do you have his address?

1235
01:05:50,991 --> 01:05:52,370
...on your fucking hand?

1236
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:57,781
That's such a good question.

1237
01:05:58,750 --> 01:05:59,750
And...

1238
01:06:00,070 --> 01:06:01,831
...the answer's really
gonna blow your mind.

1239
01:06:03,455 --> 01:06:05,576
Yeah, you can go ahead
and take that, if you need to.

1240
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:08,330
Yeah.

1241
01:06:09,850 --> 01:06:10,850
Look, uh...

1242
01:06:13,090 --> 01:06:14,090
...Ben's dead.

1243
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:16,921
Just heard it off at the scanner.

1244
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:21,400
Who did it? Cops?

1245
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:22,740
Uh, no.

1246
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:25,300
Apparently, it was just some
random... ...good Samaritan.

1247
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:27,480
Skinny guy in a suit.

1248
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:30,840
Look, um...

1249
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:34,521
...why don't you just get back
here, and we'll figure it all out.

1250
01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:38,040
Did he seriously just hang up on me?

1251
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:54,480
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hold on,
hold on, hey, let's just talk about this.

1252
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:55,560
You killed my brother!

1253
01:06:55,870 --> 01:06:57,480
Look, man, I, uh...

1254
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:01,220
...I did...

1255
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:02,720
...kill him.

1256
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:05,501
And look, I know that means
you're gonna kill me too, but please...

1257
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:07,320
...please, just do me a favor, okay?
Just...

1258
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:08,800
...just make it quick.

1259
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:11,900
There's no need...
...to draw this out.

1260
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:17,560
I got a better idea.

1261
01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:24,840
You know, when I used to do this shit...

1262
01:07:25,290 --> 01:07:26,980
...back in Special Forces...

1263
01:07:29,430 --> 01:07:31,400
...it was always to try
and get some information.

1264
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:32,840
Mm-hmm.

1265
01:07:34,430 --> 01:07:35,940
But all that matters now...

1266
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:37,660
...is the pain.

1267
01:07:38,990 --> 01:07:40,511
Think about that. You understand pain?

1268
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:43,220
Yeah. I hate it so much.

1269
01:07:46,490 --> 01:07:49,200
Oh, oh, oh! No! Stop it!

1270
01:07:49,830 --> 01:07:51,360
I mean, oh!

1271
01:07:53,890 --> 01:07:56,860
This is bad! God damn it!

1272
01:07:57,630 --> 01:08:03,230
Oh, wow!

1273
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:07,730
You sadistic fuck.

1274
01:08:08,490 --> 01:08:09,490
Oh.

1275
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:11,220
Uh-huh.

1276
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:16,590
No. Not the pliers. Please, not the pliers.

1277
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:19,981
I can't even imagine what
you're gonna do with that.

1278
01:08:20,050 --> 01:08:21,050
Please.

1279
01:08:21,090 --> 01:08:21,650
Oh.

1280
01:08:22,110 --> 01:08:23,430
This little piggy...

1281
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:25,530
...went to market.

1282
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:26,450
Yeah!

1283
01:08:26,790 --> 01:08:27,790
Wow!

1284
01:08:29,990 --> 01:08:31,871
God, I hate how you
spent so much time on this.

1285
01:08:32,950 --> 01:08:34,250
This little piggy.

1286
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:36,110
Oh, boy.

1287
01:08:36,111 --> 01:08:37,130
This little piggy.

1288
01:08:37,370 --> 01:08:38,370
Uh-huh.

1289
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:39,310
Oh!

1290
01:08:39,311 --> 01:08:40,311
Oh!

1291
01:08:40,610 --> 01:08:42,070
Wee-wee-wee-wee!

1292
01:08:42,530 --> 01:08:44,170
Fuckin' all the way home!

1293
01:08:44,330 --> 01:08:45,550
Oh! Wow, that hurt!

1294
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:47,200
That one hurt the most!

1295
01:08:48,590 --> 01:08:49,590
What are you doing?

1296
01:08:50,590 --> 01:08:51,030
Terribly!

1297
01:08:51,350 --> 01:08:52,350
No!

1298
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:53,670
Please, no!

1299
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:55,990
Whoa, this sucks so bad!

1300
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:57,750
Please don't do that again!

1301
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:04,320
What?

1302
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:05,360
Where the hell are you?

1303
01:09:06,230 --> 01:09:07,540
We're leaving in 30 minutes.
Get your ass back here.

1304
01:09:07,541 --> 01:09:08,020
Yeah, yeah.

1305
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:09,800
I'll wrap it up.

1306
01:09:15,990 --> 01:09:16,990
Not for my favorite part.

1307
01:09:22,510 --> 01:09:23,740
I'm gonna keep your eyes...

1308
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:26,420
...in a jar... ...on my mantle.

1309
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:28,960
Oh, wait, don't do that.

1310
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:29,460
No.

1311
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:30,640
Uh, uh...

1312
01:09:30,990 --> 01:09:31,800
Actually, don't do that.

1313
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:32,620
Uh, hey!

1314
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:33,760
Your brother...

1315
01:09:34,010 --> 01:09:35,500
...your brother told me something...

1316
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:36,680
...before he died.

1317
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:37,780
He said, uh...

1318
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:40,321
...he said... ...um...

1319
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,570
...tell... ...my brother...

1320
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
...I'm sorry.

1321
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:46,760
...I'm sorry.

1322
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:48,880
...for that...

1323
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:50,360
...thing...

1324
01:09:50,740 --> 01:09:52,141
...that happened when we were kids.

1325
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:58,420
He said, tell him...

1326
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:01,421
...tell him that Mom and Dad...

1327
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:03,781
...always loved you the most.

1328
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:08,480
Bullshit.

1329
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,400
We never met our dad.

1330
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:12,680
Okay.

1331
01:10:12,970 --> 01:10:14,636
I think maybe he meant
it, like, metaphorically.

1332
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:16,540
Wait, no!
Please, please, please, please don't!

1333
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:20,720
Roscoe?

1334
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:22,180
No, it's fucking Daft Punk.

1335
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:25,680
Of course it's me.

1336
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:27,580
Oh...

1337
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:29,260
...thank God.

1338
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:30,780
I was...

1339
01:10:31,740 --> 01:10:32,740
...huh.

1340
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
What do you mean, huh?

1341
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:38,660
Uh... ...no, I mean, um... ...it's
just, uh... ...didn't you say...

1342
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:43,440
...that you were six foot five... ...and
that you looked like Jason Momoa?

1343
01:10:44,190 --> 01:10:45,536
I said I kinda looked like Jason Momoa.

1344
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:46,560
Right.

1345
01:10:49,015 --> 01:10:50,100
He's just a very specific little guy.

1346
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:50,420
...looking man.

1347
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:52,720
You know, how about you just
say thank you... ...for saving my life?

1348
01:10:52,970 --> 01:10:54,100
You're totally right.

1349
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:54,580
Absolutely.

1350
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:55,800
Sorry.

1351
01:10:59,780 --> 01:11:00,780
Thank you.

1352
01:11:01,580 --> 01:11:02,580
Okay.

1353
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:04,380
Okay, that's enough.

1354
01:11:06,730 --> 01:11:08,280
Look, go do whatever you gotta do...

1355
01:11:09,030 --> 01:11:10,030
...and please stay alive.

1356
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,796
I need you to be physically able...
...to explain all this to the cops.

1357
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:13,160
Okay.

1358
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:14,720
I will stay alive.

1359
01:11:14,780 --> 01:11:15,780
I promise.

1360
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:19,440
You're gonna have to do better than that.

1361
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:19,680
Oh shit.

1362
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:21,060
Cool!

1363
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:23,460
Yeah, get something!

1364
01:11:23,740 --> 01:11:24,040
Right!

1365
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:24,700
Oh shit!

1366
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:30,040
knows what she's doing We're
really stopping the ball, huh?

1367
01:11:30,041 --> 01:11:31,041
...

1368
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:51,600
Get out of here!

1369
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:55,760
...

1370
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:05,660
... ...

1371
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:15,580
God dammit! I'm gonna kill you!

1372
01:12:26,390 --> 01:12:34,390
I'm gonna fucking rip
your fucking head off!

1373
01:12:59,110 --> 01:13:00,110
Okay.

1374
01:13:06,510 --> 01:13:08,770
Good thinking with the mace.

1375
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:17,251
Jesus. Hell of a way to go.

1376
01:13:24,430 --> 01:13:25,511
What'd you set a timer for?

1377
01:13:25,990 --> 01:13:27,630
Um, it was for your...

1378
01:13:28,310 --> 01:13:29,310
...for your...

1379
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:30,581
...for your ETA or whatever.

1380
01:13:33,470 --> 01:13:34,631
I actually should pee though.

1381
01:13:35,170 --> 01:13:36,170
Yeah.

1382
01:13:36,610 --> 01:13:37,610
Wait, what?

1383
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:43,651
Who the fuck are these guys anyway?

1384
01:13:44,540 --> 01:13:45,540
No idea.

1385
01:13:46,810 --> 01:13:48,091
Huge Home Alone fans apparently.

1386
01:13:53,790 --> 01:13:54,930
Hey, um...

1387
01:13:56,910 --> 01:13:59,050
...thanks again...
...for coming.

1388
01:14:00,030 --> 01:14:01,050
Yeah, well...

1389
01:14:01,890 --> 01:14:03,090
...one of friends four, right?

1390
01:14:05,470 --> 01:14:06,470
Yeah, man.

1391
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:07,820
That being said...

1392
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:10,090
...I will testify against you if need be.

1393
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:11,530
Yeah, no, no, no worries.

1394
01:14:11,690 --> 01:14:12,690
I assumed.

1395
01:14:15,590 --> 01:14:16,910
Oh, shit, it's the cops.

1396
01:14:17,230 --> 01:14:18,230
Well, great.

1397
01:14:18,350 --> 01:14:19,070
Tell them everything.

1398
01:14:19,270 --> 01:14:20,270
Let them go save her.

1399
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:21,050
No, no, no.

1400
01:14:21,150 --> 01:14:21,850
They're not gonna listen to me.

1401
01:14:21,890 --> 01:14:22,930
They think I'm in on this.

1402
01:14:24,130 --> 01:14:26,270
No, if I go out there... ...they're
gonna bring me to the station...

1403
01:14:26,271 --> 01:14:29,371
...and by the time I can convince anybody
to go after Sherry... ...she'll be dead.

1404
01:14:31,230 --> 01:14:32,230
Wait a minute.

1405
01:14:33,290 --> 01:14:34,310
I think I have an idea.

1406
01:14:34,390 --> 01:14:34,870
You're Harley.

1407
01:14:35,215 --> 01:14:36,546
It's still parked out front, yeah?

1408
01:14:36,570 --> 01:14:37,570
Yeah.

1409
01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:39,390
Sort of.

1410
01:14:40,290 --> 01:14:41,330
What do you mean, sort of?

1411
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:47,390
Nathan Cain!

1412
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:50,350
I need you to come out the
house with your hands up!

1413
01:14:52,845 --> 01:14:55,326
Look, come on, don't make this
harder than it has to be, okay?

1414
01:14:55,390 --> 01:14:56,850
This whole town's going to shit,

1415
01:14:57,810 --> 01:14:59,811
because the Chargers and
the Clippers betrayed us.

1416
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:00,570
Really?

1417
01:15:00,970 --> 01:15:01,970
Now?

1418
01:15:02,490 --> 01:15:03,410
Seriously, broke our hearts.

1419
01:15:03,411 --> 01:15:03,930
Our hearts for what?

1420
01:15:04,315 --> 01:15:06,851
To be second fiddle to
the Rams and the... Freeze!

1421
01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:08,330
Freeze!

1422
01:15:09,230 --> 01:15:09,550
Hey!

1423
01:15:09,770 --> 01:15:10,090
Freeze!

1424
01:15:10,150 --> 01:15:10,270
Hey!

1425
01:15:10,570 --> 01:15:10,890
Stop!

1426
01:15:10,970 --> 01:15:11,230
Freeze!

1427
01:15:11,450 --> 01:15:11,770
Stop!

1428
01:15:11,850 --> 01:15:12,850
Shit!

1429
01:15:13,270 --> 01:15:14,270
Shit!

1430
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:42,860
Who the hell is this guy?

1431
01:15:43,010 --> 01:15:44,010
Ha-ha!

1432
01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:46,290
You've been deceived, for I am not Nate.

1433
01:15:46,370 --> 01:15:47,370
Don't care.

1434
01:15:47,870 --> 01:15:48,870
Yeah.

1435
01:15:50,390 --> 01:15:51,390
But who you are?

1436
01:15:51,810 --> 01:15:52,810
Somebody.

1437
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:54,770
Who's about to go to jail.

1438
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:55,590
No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait!

1439
01:15:55,610 --> 01:15:56,746
I can help you, I can help you!

1440
01:15:56,770 --> 01:15:57,810
I know where Nate's going.

1441
01:15:58,240 --> 01:15:59,130
Yeah, we'll start talking then.

1442
01:15:59,131 --> 01:16:00,770
Okay, okay, but can we
have, like, a no-kick-off?

1443
01:16:00,771 --> 01:16:01,846
I'm not making policy from this point on.

1444
01:16:01,870 --> 01:16:02,870
Where is he?

1445
01:16:23,830 --> 01:16:24,550
Where is your jumpsuit?

1446
01:16:24,690 --> 01:16:25,730
I'm not doing this, Simon.

1447
01:16:27,130 --> 01:16:28,130
Not doing what?

1448
01:16:29,650 --> 01:16:30,650
It's already done.

1449
01:16:32,770 --> 01:16:33,770
Can't do it.

1450
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:35,790
Oh, fuck off.

1451
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:40,341
Since when did you grow
a conscience anyway, huh?

1452
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,030
I mean, what about all
the other jobs we've done?

1453
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:45,686
We've killed people before.

1454
01:16:45,710 --> 01:16:45,970
No!

1455
01:16:45,971 --> 01:16:46,350
No!

1456
01:16:46,730 --> 01:16:48,066
You've killed people before, Simon.

1457
01:16:48,090 --> 01:16:48,350
You!

1458
01:16:48,490 --> 01:16:48,630
No!

1459
01:16:48,631 --> 01:16:49,510
Not me!

1460
01:16:49,590 --> 01:16:50,590
I'm not like you!

1461
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:06,460
You think all this fake remorse
is gonna save your soul, hm?

1462
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:10,440
It's bullshit.

1463
01:17:10,740 --> 01:17:11,740
Simon.

1464
01:17:13,180 --> 01:17:14,180
You know it.

1465
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:18,380
Drop the gun!

1466
01:17:19,420 --> 01:17:20,160
Oh, my God.

1467
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:20,460
Hey.

1468
01:17:20,780 --> 01:17:21,900
I'm not gonna ask you again.

1469
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:24,580
Okay.

1470
01:17:32,050 --> 01:17:33,050
You okay, Sherry?

1471
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:36,970
I'm...

1472
01:17:37,410 --> 01:17:38,410
I'm sorry.

1473
01:17:39,410 --> 01:17:40,410
Who the fuck are you?

1474
01:17:42,130 --> 01:17:43,611
I'm the guy that killed your friends.

1475
01:17:45,490 --> 01:17:47,518
So if you don't want
to wind up like them, I

1476
01:17:47,530 --> 01:17:50,571
suggest you let her go, and
you get the hell out of here.

1477
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:54,070
Oh, my God.

1478
01:17:56,110 --> 01:17:58,450
Oh, my fucking God.

1479
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:02,410
Simon, don't.

1480
01:18:05,470 --> 01:18:07,790
You're the guy from the bank, right?

1481
01:18:12,180 --> 01:18:13,180
Okay.

1482
01:18:13,830 --> 01:18:16,511
This is legitimately the funniest
thing that's ever happened to me.

1483
01:18:18,050 --> 01:18:20,180
You've been telling us to try to save...

1484
01:18:20,660 --> 01:18:21,660
...Sherry.

1485
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:23,120
Is that right?

1486
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:26,260
Uh...

1487
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:28,420
I hate to break it to you, bud, but...

1488
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:32,421
...she's my fucking sister.

1489
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:38,900
She played you, man.

1490
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:40,600
Yeah.

1491
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:49,580
You thought that she had feelings for you.

1492
01:18:49,870 --> 01:18:50,880
Nate, I mean...

1493
01:18:52,545 --> 01:18:53,660
...I'm so sorry, okay?

1494
01:18:53,740 --> 01:18:55,040
I never meant for you to...

1495
01:18:56,740 --> 01:18:59,151
...look, everything that happened
between us, I meant it, okay?

1496
01:18:59,175 --> 01:19:00,940
Oh, what a load of horseshit.

1497
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:02,880
Look, man.

1498
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:05,640
You're pointing the gun at
the wrong bank robber, dude.

1499
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:08,120
You should be shooting her.

1500
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:11,280
So now listen.

1501
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:15,851
Why don't you just get out of here, man?

1502
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:16,320
Okay?

1503
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:17,880
What are you doing?

1504
01:19:19,980 --> 01:19:21,341
Get yourself to the urgent care...

1505
01:19:21,805 --> 01:19:24,420
...and just forget all about this.

1506
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:25,520
Stop it.

1507
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:26,920
Get over it.

1508
01:20:01,420 --> 01:20:02,621
I'll give it to you, bank boy.

1509
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:04,760
You can take a punch.

1510
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:11,750
Let's see how you do.

1511
01:20:12,030 --> 01:20:13,390
A little pressure.

1512
01:20:14,270 --> 01:20:15,270
Perfect.

1513
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:23,320
Simon, stop it.

1514
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:26,740
It's not fucking funny. Stop it.

1515
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:40,260
The crushes head.

1516
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:41,400
He started it.

1517
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:45,560
Just go.

1518
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:46,760
Honestly, just go.

1519
01:20:46,870 --> 01:20:47,500
Take the money and go.

1520
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:48,640
I'm gonna stay with him.

1521
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:50,120
You're gonna stay with...

1522
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:51,160
You're gonna stay with that guy?

1523
01:20:51,340 --> 01:20:52,340
Yeah.

1524
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:53,540
Sherry.

1525
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:56,240
Come on!

1526
01:20:59,190 --> 01:21:00,391
I don't even know you anymore.

1527
01:21:04,780 --> 01:21:05,780
Fine.

1528
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,560
Hmm?

1529
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:16,840
You won't do it.

1530
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:17,920
Yeah?

1531
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:19,760
Sure.

1532
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:21,080
Mm-hmm.

1533
01:21:26,570 --> 01:21:27,570
You know what?

1534
01:21:28,190 --> 01:21:29,190
You're right.

1535
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:31,201
You don't know me anymore.

1536
01:21:41,550 --> 01:21:42,550
Got him.

1537
01:21:42,730 --> 01:21:43,730
Moving in.

1538
01:21:48,170 --> 01:21:49,170
Get him on your head.

1539
01:21:55,450 --> 01:21:56,310
This one's cooked.

1540
01:21:56,390 --> 01:21:57,390
Help this guy.

1541
01:21:59,630 --> 01:22:00,630
Oh.

1542
01:22:02,565 --> 01:22:04,446
Damn, Vespa guy was
right, he's pretty beat up.

1543
01:22:05,150 --> 01:22:05,550
Yeah?

1544
01:22:05,660 --> 01:22:07,421
Well, good thing we're
here to save his ass.

1545
01:22:10,115 --> 01:22:11,916
You're lucky that you
got such a good friend.

1546
01:22:13,050 --> 01:22:14,571
...a little too chatty for me, though.

1547
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:37,130
Backup will be here in five.
We're still stretched thin.

1548
01:22:37,850 --> 01:22:39,251
Does that mean I can punch out now?

1549
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:41,606
Wanda's gonna start It's a
Wonderful Life without me.

1550
01:22:41,630 --> 01:22:43,711
Yeah, we'll just get the
elves to do your paperwork.

1551
01:22:44,540 --> 01:22:45,861
Wouldn't that be amazing if we...

1552
01:23:35,210 --> 01:23:37,390
Hey! Show me where you're hurt!

1553
01:23:42,110 --> 01:23:44,751
Alright, you're gonna be okay.
You just have to get to a hospital.

1554
01:23:44,885 --> 01:23:46,406
I'm gonna take your car and
I'm gonna go after them, okay?

1555
01:23:46,430 --> 01:23:48,210
Like hell! I'm not giving you my keys.

1556
01:23:50,670 --> 01:23:51,670
Sorry.

1557
01:23:52,850 --> 01:23:54,251
Don't worry. I'm gonna make sure...

1558
01:23:59,770 --> 01:24:01,051
...you're really gonna shoot me.

1559
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:02,160
I should, asshole.

1560
01:24:03,990 --> 01:24:05,800
But I won't. You're taking me with you.

1561
01:24:21,470 --> 01:24:23,390
Hey, can someone please
tell me what's going on?

1562
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:27,980
I know where he's going.

1563
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:30,620
Where who's going? Are we going
to a high-speed chase right now?

1564
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:05,560
I don't know how you drive.
I don't know who you are.

1565
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:06,640
And it's not a school bus!

1566
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:30,300
You again!

1567
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:32,260
Oh, Jesus Christ!

1568
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:55,720
Stroller!

1569
01:25:55,920 --> 01:26:02,640
Jesus!
Where'd you learn to drive like this?

1570
01:26:02,820 --> 01:26:03,820
I used to boost cars.

1571
01:26:06,940 --> 01:26:07,940
What? I don't anymore!

1572
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:17,830
Oh, I might be dying.
But I'm gonna kill you first.

1573
01:26:45,980 --> 01:26:47,280
You fucking loser!

1574
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:53,660
So where is this son of a bitch going?

1575
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:54,900
He's headed to Pier 7.

1576
01:26:55,940 --> 01:26:56,940
Where for?

1577
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:59,400
There's a boat waiting.
It was gonna take us south.

1578
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:00,020
To a taxi!

1579
01:27:00,510 --> 01:27:01,510
I can see! Thank you!

1580
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:23,600
You wanna know something funny?

1581
01:27:24,180 --> 01:27:25,840
If you'd have just stayed in that bank...

1582
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:29,600
...Sherry would be right
here sitting next to me.

1583
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:33,720
She'd be just fine.

1584
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:37,320
But now...

1585
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:39,200
...Now...

1586
01:27:39,580 --> 01:27:41,020
...I'm gonna hunt her ass down.

1587
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:43,000
I promise you that.

1588
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:45,860
Yeah, well...

1589
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:49,050
...If you do find Sherry...

1590
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:53,400
...I want you to tell her
something for me, okay?

1591
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:54,640
Oh, God.

1592
01:27:57,140 --> 01:27:59,520
You are one sorry son of a bitch.

1593
01:27:59,780 --> 01:28:00,780
You know that?

1594
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:05,580
Yeah, I know, right?

1595
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:07,740
It's kind of my thing.

1596
01:28:09,340 --> 01:28:11,520
Listen... ...I want
you to tell her...

1597
01:28:13,020 --> 01:28:15,460
...that even though we didn't
spend a lot of time together...

1598
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:17,880
...that I always...

1599
01:28:18,910 --> 01:28:19,910
...felt like we...

1600
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:21,880
...could've gone...

1601
01:28:27,210 --> 01:28:28,490
What did you feel like?

1602
01:28:29,310 --> 01:28:30,450
What was that?

1603
01:28:31,070 --> 01:28:33,630
I can't fucking hear you.
You're mumbling. Speak up!

1604
01:28:34,690 --> 01:28:36,610
Sorry. I'll try to be a little more...

1605
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:10,900
...Clear!

1606
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:23,840
I like that you're making
me earn it, bank boy.

1607
01:30:24,470 --> 01:30:25,470
We gotta wrap this up.

1608
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:27,520
Let's go!

1609
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:29,440
Let's go.

1610
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:31,600
What?

1611
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:34,880
I can't... ...I can't...

1612
01:30:37,110 --> 01:30:37,720
...I'm sorry, I have to go.

1613
01:30:37,721 --> 01:30:38,721
Wait, wait.

1614
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,361
God, I hope I live to regret this.

1615
01:30:46,300 --> 01:30:47,300
Take it.

1616
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:50,440
That motherfucker...
...shot my partner.

1617
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:54,600
Don't miss.

1618
01:31:00,650 --> 01:31:01,430
You, out.

1619
01:31:01,530 --> 01:31:02,530
Okay.

1620
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:05,150
Get her to a hospital.

1621
01:31:05,810 --> 01:31:06,810
Sure. Yeah.

1622
01:31:08,810 --> 01:31:10,190
God, that's a lot of blood.

1623
01:31:10,870 --> 01:31:12,630
At least it's not a
stick shift, am I right?

1624
01:31:12,670 --> 01:31:14,250
Sorry. I'm bleeding to death.

1625
01:31:14,290 --> 01:31:15,290
Right.

1626
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:17,300
You always did fight, didn't you?

1627
01:32:26,660 --> 01:32:27,660
Sherry!

1628
01:32:28,580 --> 01:32:31,440
Looks like I finally found a way
to make you feel something, huh?

1629
01:32:32,700 --> 01:32:33,180
Ah!

1630
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:34,520
Ah!

1631
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:35,240
Ah!

1632
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:35,740
Ah!

1633
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:36,800
Ah!

1634
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Ah!

1635
01:33:10,610 --> 01:33:11,610
Shit!

1636
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:21,120
I gotta ask you something.

1637
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:22,700
Feel this.

1638
01:33:38,050 --> 01:33:39,050
Nate, Nate!

1639
01:33:40,630 --> 01:33:42,550
Nate, Nate!

1640
01:33:43,770 --> 01:33:44,770
Nate!

1641
01:33:45,170 --> 01:33:46,970
Hey, Sherry.

1642
01:33:46,971 --> 01:33:50,810
I love you, baby. I love you.

1643
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:01,321
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1644
01:34:03,380 --> 01:34:04,540
Hey, hey, please, please.

1645
01:34:05,510 --> 01:34:06,580
Help! Over here, please!

1646
01:34:09,385 --> 01:34:11,560
I'm so sorry, man. I'm so sorry.

1647
01:34:11,940 --> 01:34:13,840
Let me have it right here. I'm not going...

1648
01:34:57,950 --> 01:34:58,950
Hey, hey, hey.

1649
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:03,080
There he is. How are you feeling, bud?

1650
01:35:03,940 --> 01:35:04,940
What happened?

1651
01:35:06,010 --> 01:35:08,700
Well, you've had some major blood loss.

1652
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:10,300
And a heart attack.

1653
01:35:10,620 --> 01:35:11,680
And a brain hemorrhage.

1654
01:35:13,150 --> 01:35:14,150
And third-degree burns.

1655
01:35:14,930 --> 01:35:15,980
And a lot of broken bones.

1656
01:35:16,860 --> 01:35:19,080
But you're okay now.
It's a Christmas miracle.

1657
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:21,560
It's Christmas?

1658
01:35:22,110 --> 01:35:23,600
It's actually January 11th.

1659
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:25,320
You've been in a medically induced coma.

1660
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:27,520
But still, you're alive!

1661
01:35:32,495 --> 01:35:33,495
Wait, Sherry, is she...

1662
01:35:34,240 --> 01:35:35,820
Don't worry. Sherry's fine.

1663
01:35:36,660 --> 01:35:37,660
She's okay.

1664
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:41,440
Oh, we meet again.

1665
01:35:41,640 --> 01:35:41,800
Hey.

1666
01:35:42,570 --> 01:35:43,660
Hey, look who's up.

1667
01:35:44,060 --> 01:35:44,500
Yep.

1668
01:35:45,060 --> 01:35:46,060
You look...

1669
01:35:48,980 --> 01:35:49,980
...brave.

1670
01:35:50,730 --> 01:35:53,131
I'm glad you're up, because I
just came from the courthouse.

1671
01:35:53,220 --> 01:35:55,660
You know, you're looking at
some pretty serious charges here.

1672
01:35:56,330 --> 01:35:58,760
Manslaughter, breaking
and entering, grand theft auto.

1673
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:00,600
Yeah, those...

1674
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:02,500
Those sound really bad.

1675
01:36:02,501 --> 01:36:03,520
Yeah, they are.

1676
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:06,096
There's enough here to lock
you up until you're twice my age.

1677
01:36:06,120 --> 01:36:06,660
Uh-huh.

1678
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,600
But you did save a cop's life.

1679
01:36:09,020 --> 01:36:11,620
And you also had some pretty
persuasive character witnesses.

1680
01:36:14,700 --> 01:36:16,860
Also, you're a white guy
who works for a bank, so...

1681
01:36:16,861 --> 01:36:18,340
...the judge took it easy on you.

1682
01:36:19,140 --> 01:36:21,520
Six months house arrest,
five years probation.

1683
01:36:22,940 --> 01:36:25,260
Get a lawyer to look at that,
but it's a pretty good deal.

1684
01:36:26,820 --> 01:36:27,820
Oh.

1685
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:29,340
Almost forgot the best part.

1686
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:33,660
This is from Grace.

1687
01:36:36,220 --> 01:36:37,220
My daughter.

1688
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:44,200
Take care, Nate.

1689
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:47,240
Thank you, Detective.

1690
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:48,720
Detective.

1691
01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:00,380
You look... Are you
looking at the hand?

1692
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:01,360
Oh, the hand?

1693
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:03,360
Oh, you mean your burnt-up, crisped-up tan?

1694
01:37:03,420 --> 01:37:04,080
Yeah, I... yeah.

1695
01:37:04,300 --> 01:37:06,580
I mean, it's... it's jarring, for sure.

1696
01:37:06,860 --> 01:37:07,860
Is it the worst part?

1697
01:37:07,940 --> 01:37:11,640
I just think, like, they shouldn't have
to dress it up all sexy like in fishnets.

1698
01:37:11,641 --> 01:37:12,720
It's a skin graft.

1699
01:37:13,190 --> 01:37:14,700
Look, I... I would get a glove.

1700
01:37:15,420 --> 01:37:15,780
Okay.

1701
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:17,160
Personally, yeah.

1702
01:37:19,720 --> 01:37:20,820
Prepare for pain.

1703
01:37:21,580 --> 01:37:23,420
This guy must not know
who he's dealing with.

1704
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:26,920
Okay, cast toxic cloud. I'm equipping
the Blackstone armor. I'm going in.

1705
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:30,176
Oh, hey, you're coming on Saturday, right?
It's a big birthday for me.

1706
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:30,540
Yeah, man.

1707
01:37:31,200 --> 01:37:33,500
Wait, it's not...
it's not at a biker bar, is it?

1708
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:34,720
Fuck you.

1709
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:37,901
Yeah, man, of course I'm gonna be there.

1710
01:37:40,460 --> 01:37:41,460
Oh.

1711
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:41,940
Oh, shit.

1712
01:37:42,650 --> 01:37:45,196
Dude, just hold it for a couple more
minutes. This guy's almost dead.

1713
01:37:45,220 --> 01:37:48,181
No, dude, uh, it's not that. I actually
have to get ready for that dinner.

1714
01:37:48,940 --> 01:37:51,180
Wow. You're ditching me to go on a date.

1715
01:37:51,310 --> 01:37:53,051
I know, I know. It's
very cute and adorable,

1716
01:37:53,063 --> 01:37:54,896
and I will make this up
to you later. Goodbye.

1717
01:37:54,920 --> 01:37:55,920
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1718
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:01,120
Hey, uh...

1719
01:38:01,860 --> 01:38:04,080
I can't believe it's been
a year since our first date.

1720
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:08,500
I am... so happy I tried the bunny.

1721
01:38:10,060 --> 01:38:11,060
Me too.

1722
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:13,841
And, hey, you even wore your tie.

1723
01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:15,640
Yeah, you noticed. Yeah.

1724
01:38:15,900 --> 01:38:18,290
Took the dry cleaners
a while to get the blood

1725
01:38:18,302 --> 01:38:20,600
stains out, but, um, you
know, they managed.

1726
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:21,800
They did a good job.

1727
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:24,420
Oh, wait, um... sorry, I almost forgot.

1728
01:38:30,150 --> 01:38:31,310
Oh, my God.

1729
01:38:34,245 --> 01:38:35,846
Hey, you finally figured out the ending.

1730
01:38:36,310 --> 01:38:39,005
It felt kind of weird to
have the knight rescuing the

1731
01:38:39,017 --> 01:38:42,030
damsel, so I had them, you
know, kind of saving each other.

1732
01:38:43,930 --> 01:38:44,930
It's perfect.

1733
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:48,881
Hey! Button that shirt up!

1734
01:38:49,820 --> 01:38:50,916
This ain't no conjugal visit, man.

1735
01:38:50,940 --> 01:38:53,390
Oh, sorry.
No, this isn't like a sex thing. This is...

1736
01:38:53,890 --> 01:38:55,810
Uh-huh. Okay. Yep. Got it.

1737
01:38:56,290 --> 01:38:58,211
And I know that's not
an open flame, I'm saying.

1738
01:38:58,490 --> 01:38:59,490
Nope, it's not.

1739
01:39:03,350 --> 01:39:04,070
Don't play with me.

1740
01:39:04,310 --> 01:39:05,666
I'm not trying to play with you, sir.

1741
01:39:05,690 --> 01:39:07,330
Just shh. Is he new?

1742
01:39:08,050 --> 01:39:08,710
Uh, no.

1743
01:39:08,770 --> 01:39:09,050
He's intense.

1744
01:39:09,330 --> 01:39:09,650
Yeah.

1745
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:10,310
He's really intense.

1746
01:39:10,330 --> 01:39:11,350
Yeah, they're strict here. It's jail.

1747
01:39:11,351 --> 01:39:13,110
Inmate 241, time's up.

1748
01:39:13,430 --> 01:39:15,150
That was a tight 15 minutes, huh?

1749
01:39:15,310 --> 01:39:16,310
Yeah.

1750
01:39:16,970 --> 01:39:19,571
At least we only have to put up
with it for another eight months.

1751
01:39:20,655 --> 01:39:22,570
Eh, seven months, 19
days, but who's counting?

1752
01:39:24,070 --> 01:39:25,471
Man, don't make me come over there.

1753
01:39:26,770 --> 01:39:28,410
You're gonna give me a job, so I'm sorry.

1754
01:39:28,470 --> 01:39:28,490
Hey.

1755
01:39:29,270 --> 01:39:30,270
He's so intense.

1756
01:39:30,350 --> 01:39:31,090
I know, I gotta go.

1757
01:39:31,210 --> 01:39:32,210
Okay.

1758
01:39:36,390 --> 01:39:39,790
I'll, uh, see you soon, Novocaine.

1759
01:40:14,030 --> 01:40:14,830
Okay.

1760
01:40:14,831 --> 01:40:15,230
Ready?

1761
01:40:15,350 --> 01:40:16,350
Yeah.

1762
01:40:16,690 --> 01:40:17,490
You lead, Novocaine.

1763
01:40:17,491 --> 01:40:17,510
Okay.

1764
01:40:17,511 --> 01:40:17,870
Yeah.

1765
01:40:17,871 --> 01:40:18,871
See you.
