4
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:13,596
My first time ever performing
in Atlanta, Georgia.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,766
I was picked up from the airport
by a Black comedian in a Lexus,

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,561
which was a rare car
to see a Black dude in,

7
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:21,646
especially one that told jokes
for a living.

8
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:25,400
And we went to a comedy club
that he was a part owner in.

9
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:27,944
This is also a unique experience
in my career.

10
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:31,990
Now, the guy was a beast.

11
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:33,324
Onstage and off.

12
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:37,328
Offstage, this motherfucker rolled
one blunt after another like a master.

13
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:41,791
And onstage… [exhales]

14
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,626
…he was like a force of nature.

15
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,548
In fact, he called himself
after a natural disaster.

16
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:54,179
It is my pleasure to present
to you guys tonight,

17
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:56,473
the first Netflix special

18
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,559
that I've ever produced

19
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:00,810
that I'm not in.

20
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:05,148

Goddamn right.

36
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:49,734
Good to be home, goddamn it.

37
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:53,988
Good to be home.
Southeast DC, that's right.

38
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:56,074
Ballou High School.

39
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:58,910
That's what we're talking about.
It's the real DC.

40
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:00,912
They came to me and said,

41
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:03,414
"We're gonna do this special.
Where do you want to do it at?"

42
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,917
Could've did it anywhere in the world.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,002
I said, "No, I want to come home.

44
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:11,881
I want to come home and see how it is."

45
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,677
And goddamn it, I'm feeling good.
I hope y'all feeling good.

46
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,762
I'm feeling good
'cause I got that vaccine.

47
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,138
[laughter]

48
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,851
Yeah. I'm telling you,
I got it when it first came out.

49
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:26,020
The line was so long,
it looked like they was hiring.

50
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,274
I stood in that motherfucker.

51
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,192
I'm like, "I hope they don't run out."

52
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,193
[laughter]

53
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,736
It looked like they was running out.

54
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,072
There was this old lady,
and she was 89, in front of me.

55
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,657
I just pushed her to the side.

56
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:41,244
"Come on, Mama, you done lived your life.

57
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,914
You got more problems
than this coronavirus.

58
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:48,293
You're in a wheelchair with crutches.

59
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,211
You're being selfish right now.

60
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:54,382
You're supposed to be home somewhere
getting together with the Lord.

61
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,718
You're being real selfish."

62
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,971
You can't tell Black people
you took the shot.

63
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:02,181
Oh! They look at you
like you done sold out.

64
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,266
[laughter]

65
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,977
"You put that shit in your body?
Ooh, Lord. Mm-mmm.

66
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,188
Oh! Oh, goddamn. Say it ain't so.

67
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,815
Say it ain't so.

68
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,525
How could you do that?"

69
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,445
I said, "The same way you put
that cocaine in your nose.

70
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,990
You ain't got no problem
with that eight ball, motherfucker.

71
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,784
But I'm wrong for trusting Fauci.

72
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:25,038
You get your drugs from a nigga
in the club in the bathroom."

73
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,625
You see them smoking a blunt
with eight people. Just smoking it.

74
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,877
[coughing] "Ooh!"

75
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,712
Just passing it around.

76
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,589
"You're gonna take that chance.

77
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:37,091
But I'm wrong for fucking with Fauci."

78
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,176
[laughter]

79
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,637
I've got a cousin.
This motherfucker lives in Michigan.

80
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,722
He done call me and said,
"Quake, I heard bad news."

81
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:45,683
"What's wrong?" He said, "Man,
I heard you put that poison in your body.

82
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,811
How could you do it?"
I said, "Nigga, you live in Flint.

83
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,522
[laughter, applause]

84
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,650
And you just got out the shower.

85
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:58,446
You ain't got no problem with
that funky-ass water on your Black ass."

86
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,784
I mean, they ought to be ashamed
of their damned selves.

87
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:06,162
I mean, you from DC, you done took
more chances than the vaccine.

88
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,707
You know how many women
I done fucked with that had a fever?

89
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,045
I was like, "Ooh, you really is sick.

90
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:16,673
I thought you ain't want to give me none.

91
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,676
I'ma get you
some Theraflu in the morning."

92
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,845
[sneezes] "God bless you. God bless you."

93
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,765
I just want motherfuckers
to be consistent.

94
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,978
They are-- No, keep that same energy

95
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,897
on all the other symptoms
you've got in your body.

96
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,483
Coronavirus ain't the only shit
that's plaguing our community.

97
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:38,403
I want you to be on it.
These hypocrites that we got out here--

98
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:42,031
You got brothers out here been wearing
a mask straight for 18 months.

99
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,993
Ain't seen a dentist in 18 years.

100
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,786
[laughter]

101
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:49,372
Just be chewing
on the left side of their mouth.

102
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:53,209
Knowing they can't fuck
with that right tooth.

103
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:57,422
Brush their teeth in the morning,
sink look like a crime scene.

104
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:02,677
They be trying to hide evidence
like they on <i>First 48 Hours</i> and shit.

105
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,970
Kids coming in, looking at this,

106
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:06,931
talking about, "Daddy, let me get
some of them Red Hots you eating."

107
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:10,393
"I ain't eating no Red Hots."
"You are eating Red Hots!"

108
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,812
Phony-ass.

109
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,981
You know it. Stay consistent.

110
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,066
Be looking all good on the outside.

111
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,653
Jordans on their feet, diamonds
in their ear. Flawless on the outside.

112
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,531
Inside, blood pressure
higher than giraffe pussy.

113
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,076
Type 2, 3, 4, 5 diabetes.

114
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,580
Still standing in line,
trying to get a Popeyes chicken sandwich.

115
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:34,375
Eat four of them motherfuckers.
"I don't know why I'm dizzy.

116
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,836
I took a Benadryl."

117
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,256
"Benadryl don't help no stroke,
motherfucker.

118
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,469
Everything ain't your allergies, nigga.
Everything ain't your allergies."

119
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:48,639
Left arm be going numb. "What's wrong?"

120
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,558
"Oh, that mean
it gonna rain this Saturday."

121
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:53,853
"What the fuck you mean
it's gonna rain this Saturday?

122
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:57,190
Your arm ain't no weatherman, nigga.
Go see a doctor."

123
00:05:58,232 --> 00:05:59,859
You know who they are.

124
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:03,154
Got car insurance.
Ain't got no health insurance.

125
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,573
He all at the club,
"Look at my new ride, nigga.

126
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:08,326
Full coverage, zero deductible."

127
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,828
"What about your liver?"
"Oh, I leave that to Jesus.

128
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:11,913
[laughter]

129
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,664
He know my heart."

130
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:15,875
Health is wealth.

131
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,044
If you ain't learned shit
through this pandemic,

132
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:20,755
that bag don't mean shit
if you ain't got your health.

133
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,509
You know-- You need to know
the status of your health.

134
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,010
And the only way you're gonna know

135
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,638
the status of your health
is get a physical.

136
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,640
Your president, Barack Obama,

137
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:34,102
put his whole political capital
on the line for Obamacare.

138
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,353
I got Obamacare.

139
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:38,940
Ain't no way they're gonna put all
these hospitals and urgent cares up there,

140
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,691
and something wrong with my chest,

141
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,277
I'm gonna go home, take a nap
and drink a ginger ale.

142
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,490
[laughs] Somebody gonna see me.

143
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,992
I'm just gonna have to owe you.

144
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,247
When Obamacare came out, nigga,
I was on that shit.

145
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,040
I filled it out. [imitates typing]

146
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,834
Didn't even wait for a policy number.

147
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:01,379
As soon as they said, "approved," nigga,
I ran straight to the doctor.

148
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:04,507
"Hey, what you here for?"
"Nigga, I want a full physical."

149
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:08,010
They're like, "Who your provider?"
I wrote, "Obamacare."

150
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,220
[laughter]

151
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,430
[chuckles] 'Cause that nigga cares.

152
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,432
"Now that I got insurance,

153
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:16,227
I want every test you got
in this hospital, from A to Z, nigga.

154
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,478
Don't skip none of them.

155
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:23,067
I want EKG, EGG, pap smear,
I want it all, motherfucker.

156
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:29,782
And I want ultrasound, mammogram,
father-gram, leg-gram.

157
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,869
An eight ball. That's a half a gram.

158
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:36,038
I want all my grams, nigga."

159
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,957
But health is wealth.

160
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,586
You will not know the status
of your health unless you get a physical.

161
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:44,964
Every year, for my birthday,
that is my gift to myself.

162
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:48,426
We still dying of illnesses
they done already cured in full.

163
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,053
And it's the scariest shit in the world,
because certain people,

164
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,514
you know something's wrong with your body,
but you don't go.

165
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,851
See, me personally, I would hate for
something to be wrong with my damn body

166
00:07:56,934 --> 00:08:01,731
and I never, ever do nothing about it,
and then I just let it go and go.

167
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,484
And then finally be rushed to
the hospital, and the doctor like, "Ooh.

168
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:08,946
If you'd have got here three weeks ago,
that shit was just in your ear."

169
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,031
[laughter]

170
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,742
"Where's it at now?" "In your foot."

171
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,744
"How long I got?" "Tomorrow."

172
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,748
It's the scariest shit in the world.
I get a physical every year.

173
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,041
This year was no different.

174
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:22,126
Doctor came in.
I said, "How am I doing, Doc?"

175
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,961
He said, "I got your lab result back.

176
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,923
Everything is looking good.
You just have one minor discrepancy."

177
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,258
I said, "What's that?"
He said, "Your PSA is high."

178
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,386
I said, "What's that?" He said,
"That's the indicator of your prostate.

179
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:36,057
You being a Black man, prostate cancer
is prevalent in your community.

180
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,060
What I need you to do is go back
and see the reception,

181
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,937
make another appointment, come back.

182
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,023
I'm gonna do a prostate exam
along with your physical.

183
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:46,192
I'm running behind
about a month and a half.

184
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,110
I should be able to get to see you then."

185
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,613
I'm like, "Fuck that, nigga.
We doing this shit today.

186
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,658
I got Obamacare, nigga.
Put that shit on the bill.

187
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,411
Let's run that shit up
before that Republican-care come."

188
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,957
He said, "You want to do it today?"
I said, "Yeah, I want to do it today."

189
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,167
So I start rolling up my sleeves.

190
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,752
[laughter]

191
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,799
Yeah, he laughed just like that.

192
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:14,053
He said, "No,
we don't do no prostate exam like that."

193
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,889
I said, "How you do it?"
He said, "We do that with a rectum exam."

194
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,350
I said, "Well, I don't think I got that
on my Obamacare."

195
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,726
[laughter]

196
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,313
[laughs] I said, "I don't think Barack
would do that shit for me."

197
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,942
He said, "Just go in the other room.
There's a gown behind the door.

198
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:31,445
Take your clothes off, put the gown on and
come back out. We can do the procedure."

199
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:34,365
I'm gonna tell you all right now,
my people from DC,

200
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,659
I have been rich my whole life.

201
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,786
And I'm not talking about monetarily.

202
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:42,748
I'm talking about rich of the blessing
of my God.

203
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,543
Been on this earth 58 years.

204
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,962
I have never spent a night in a hospital.

205
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,047
I have never had no surgery.

206
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,882
I ain't never had no broken bones,

207
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:56,512
other than this wrist right here riding
that raggedy-ass bike my daddy gave me.

208
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,681
So I don't know shit about no hospital.

209
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,976
So when he told me to go take my clothes
off and put the gown on, I did it.

210
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,644
And I put the motherfucker on.

211
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,896
But it was too small. It wouldn't close.

212
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,399
So I stuck my head
behind the door and said,

213
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:11,861
"Hey, Doc, I need a bigger gown. This
motherfucker ain't going over my stomach."

214
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,655
He said, "No, you've got it on wrong.
Turn it around."

215
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,657
I said, "I'll be damned.

216
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,702
I know I'm wearing this gown right."

217
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,247
'Cause if it's between my dick
and my ass being out,

218
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,916
my dick already understands.

219
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:29,211
The ass is always covered.

220
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,922
And every part of my body knows that rule.

221
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,634
If I only got one sock, fuck my foot.

222
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,970
That motherfucker going down
the crack of my ass.

223
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:42,141
And if we doing a rectum exam,
I know I'm wearing this gown right.

224
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,602
'Cause you're gonna have
to lift this bitch and let me know

225
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:45,811
it's about to go down.

226
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:49,065
I ain't just gonna leave it open for you
to come in there when you feel like it.

227
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,984
I don't know what kind of…

228
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,820
I don't know what kind of patients
you be having

229
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:58,532
with their head down, ass up,
but I ain't that kind of patient.

230
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:01,077
I need a head start or a warning.

231
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,538
Ten, nine, eight… Oh, shit.

232
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,583
My ass is getting a little chilly.

233
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:10,127
It must be time for him to do it.

234
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,005
So I knew I had the gown on right,

235
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,091
so I just walked out there,
holding my dick.

236
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,550
I said, "I'm ready."

237
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,554
He said, "I told you. You've got the gown
on wrong. Turn it around."

238
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:24,100
I said, "I'll be damned." He said,
"Fuck it. Bend down and look over there."

239
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,769
I said, "I don't like how you said that.

240
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,397
You need to take that bass out your voice.

241
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,566
You're a little too angry
to be fucking with my ass right now.

242
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,569
I think we need to reschedule
this appointment.

243
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:39,824
And if you're gonna keep arguing like this
with me, I need to put my drawers on.

244
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,910
I don't like to argue with no nigga
if I ain't got no drawers on.

245
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:47,248
You got your drawers on.
Why can't I put my drawers on?"

246
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:51,502
So I went on and bent back over. "Come on.
Let's get this bullshit over with."

247
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:54,797
This nigga gonna say, "Stay still."
I said, "Shit.

248
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:59,927
You better hit this motherfucker
while it's moving. I told you I'm scared.

249
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:05,224
My leg is shaking 'cause I'm afraid."
So I looked over my shoulder.

250
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:08,102
This motherfucker
put gel on three fingers.

251
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:11,313
I jumped the fuck up.
He was like, "What's wrong?"

252
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,941
I said, "Let me see what finger
you're gonna use.

253
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,527
Oh, you ain't using that finger
with that fucked-up knuckle.

254
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,948
Trying to put that big-ass knuckle in
my ass, that football knuckle you got.

255
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:24,034
I ought to whup your ass for trying
to put that motherfucker in me.

256
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,996
Your pinkie you got should be able
to find what you're looking for.

257
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:30,499
I ought to whup your ass, Doc.
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

258
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,669
Are you sure this is the only way
you can check my prostate?

259
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:37,548
'Cause if I go home and I google
and I find there's another test,

260
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:40,593
I'm gonna come back here
and whup your motherfucking ass

261
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,761
in front of all this equipment."

262
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:43,929
[laughter]

263
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,764
So I went on and bent back over.

264
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,350
"Come on.
Let's get this bullshit over with."

265
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:53,689
He lifted up my gown, and I said,
"Oh, shit. It's about to go down."

266
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:57,443
And he lifted it up and he broke me off.
I was like, "Oh, goddamn it."

267
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:00,779
He said, "Don't worry. It ain't gonna
take long." I said, "You ain't got long.

268
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,532
Hurry up and find
what you're looking for."

269
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,202
He kept moving his finger
in and out of my ass.

270
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,746
I said, "Fuck it.
Take your finger out of my ass.

271
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,748
If I've got prostate cancer,
leave it in there.

272
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,919
I'm just gonna have to take it up
with the Lord.

273
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,129
But you ain't just gonna
rotate your finger

274
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,423
in and out of my ass
like this no more, sir.

275
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,718
Take your finger out of my ass
immediately, sir.

276
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:26,472
Stop right now. No means no, sir."

277
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,142
[laughing]

278
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:40,152
I tried-- I got up.
Nigga tried to fix my goddamn gown.

279
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:43,531
He gonna take the glove off
all seductively,

280
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,534
one finger at a time.

281
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:49,870
Gonna look me in the face,
give me a box of tissues,

282
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,705
talking about, "Wipe yourself off.

283
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:52,790
[laughter]

284
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:56,335
Pull your drawers up.
Follow me in the other room."

285
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,879
I said, "This nigga has just assaulted me.

286
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:01,048
I've been raped."

287
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,592
I went and bought me a "Me Too" T-shirt.

288
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:04,677
[laughter]

289
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,347
I went all to the meeting.
I was like, "Me too, bitches. Me too.

290
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,058
Y'all are gonna hear what happened to me
in that doctor's office.

291
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,935
I've got a story to tell."

292
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:16,897
I left that doctor's office,
ass just slippery.

293
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:17,982
[laughter]

294
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,526
Slid all the way to the elevator.

295
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,736
Couldn't even look
another man in the face.

296
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,865
I was like, "He broke me in there!
He broke me in there!"

297
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,578
Seen a gay dude.
I was like, "You're a soldier.

298
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,415
You can take a dick.
I couldn't take a pinkie.

299
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,625
You're a tough one. You're tough."

300
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,378
If you're taking a dick every night, mmm!

301
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,882
These ain't jokes.

302
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:51,307
And Black people, we done voted Trump out,

303
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,517
but we ain't killed this motherfucker.

304
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,895
He's still alive politically.

305
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,647
White people believe in him
right below Jesus.

306
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,941
Oh, they believe in his ass.

307
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,319
They're just lying to good white folks.

308
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,778
"Stop the steal.

309
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,530
They just stole the vote.

310
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,783
Fraud. Irregularity with voting."

311
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:13,787
See, Black people, I don't never want
y'all ever to say your votes don't count.

312
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,165
The reason why
they've got all these problems,

313
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:20,127
changing all-- the Republicans changing
all the goddamn rules for voting,

314
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,463
is 'cause we showed the fuck up.

315
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:30,179
I tell my white friends all the time:
"If you're gonna lie on Black people,

316
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,681
at least get a lie
that's believable, nigga.

317
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,516
You want the whole world to believe

318
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,353
that niggas went down there
and voted two times?"

319
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:43,233
We commit a lot of crimes,
but we don't fuck with that paperwork.

320
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:49,198
But you can't say nothing. You can't tell
a Trump supporter nothing about Trump.

321
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:53,577
"Oh, yeah, not my Trump, mm-mmm!"
They love motherfucking Trump.

322
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,955
People ask me all the time, "What kind of
woman are you looking for in your life?"

323
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,501
I say, "Nigga, I'm looking
for a woman like a Trump supporter.

324
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:03,879
No matter what she hears about me,
that bitch don't believe shit."

325
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:04,964
[laughter]

326
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,924
"I heard he got another woman."

327
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:09,259
"That's fake news, baby. That's fake news.

328
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:12,846
Don't listen to them hos.
They're the enemy of the state."

329
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,225
These ain't jokes.

330
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:20,062
I knew Trump was the pimp of all pimps,
nigga, when he came here

331
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,065
and sent them motherfuckers up here
January 6th.

332
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:26,443
He told the motherfuckers,
"Meet me here January 6th."

333
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,154
They came up there like he was Moses.

334
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:35,452
Just stepping. I've never seen
so many RVs, pickup trucks,

335
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:36,996
white women with no teeth.

336
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,414
They was everywhere.

337
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,540
[laughter]

338
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:42,001
And then he came out and talked.

339
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:45,421
Did the speech,
their old motherfucking fearless leader.

340
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:49,675
"Right now, they're in there,
trying to certify the steal.

341
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:52,886
You're not doing anything.
They're stealing your vote.

342
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:57,433
If you allow what happens in there,
you're not gonna have a country.

343
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:02,438
Now, what we're gonna do, we're gonna
walk down to the Capitol and stop 'em.

344
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,940
I'ma go with you,
and I'ma meet you there."

345
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,901
[chuckles] Trump went home.

346
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,947
That nigga was at the crib, just chilling.

347
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,410
White people was going crazy, nigga.
They was knocking shit over,

348
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:21,248
whupping police asses,
climbing all on the wall and shit.

349
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:24,126
I was watching that shit on TV.
All I was wishing is,

350
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:28,130
"Ooh, I wish I was a Capitol police
working that day."

351
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,965
If I was there, I would have been like…

352
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,467
[imitating gunshots]

353
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,637
"What you doing?" "Saving democracy.

354
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,685
These motherfuckers are everywhere.

355
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:45,314
If you ain't gonna use your gun,
give it to me.

356
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,738
There's that motherfucker
with that Confederate flag."

357
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,450
Click, click, click. [grunts]

358
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,080
Oh, I would have tore their ass up.

359
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:04,249
I'd have called my boy. "I told you
to be here as a security guard."

360
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,376
[imitating gunshots]

361
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,004
I'm shooting Trump supporters
on the clock.

362
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,881
[laughter]

363
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,467
"Don't punch me out.
I'm gonna do overtime today."

364
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,014
"What's your name, boy?"
"Crispus Attucks."

365
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:25,729
Believe me, if I was working,
they would have got off them steps.

366
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,397
"Stop the steal!" [imitates gunshots]

367
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:30,067
"This nigga is serious.
Back up, Billy Bob."

368
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,152
[laughter]

369
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,740
[cheering, applause]

370
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:45,374
Trump ain't got no cut.
He ain't give a fuck.

371
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:49,878
I knew he had no cut when he told
John McCain, "You ain't no war hero."

372
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:54,049
[chuckles] And they said, "Why?"
"Cause he got captured.

373
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,177
I like soldiers that don't get caught."

374
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:00,973
John McCain hated that motherfucker
till the day he died.

375
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,892
They say you ain't supposed
to take a grudge to your grave.

376
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:07,855
John McCain was like, "Fuck that shit."
I'ma tell you something.

377
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,732
If you down for Trump, against Trump,
or even if you are Trump,

378
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,401
you've gotta look yourself in the mirror.

379
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,486
You know you a fucked-up individual

380
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,822
when a nigga
don't want you at his funeral.

381
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:22,369
They said John McCain's last words
were like, "Tell that nigga not to come."

382
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,080
They said, "What about the Reaper?"

383
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:29,585
"Mm-mmm! If he comes in the church,
I'ma walk out the casket."

384
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:33,088
Like, "Damn,
he blocked that nigga like Facebook."

385
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,674
[chuckles]

386
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,801
You can say what you want
to say about John McCain,

387
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,262
but that motherfucker was a war hero.

388
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:44,433
I'm telling you. That motherfucker
was a prisoner of war, dawg.

389
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,268
He got shot behind enemy lines

390
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,313
fucking with them Viet Cong niggas,
and they fucked John up.

391
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,398
If you want to know
what John McCain went through,

392
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,692
all you've gotta do
is watch the first <i>Rambo.</i>

393
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,944
[laughter]

394
00:19:56,028 --> 00:20:00,324
[chuckles] They pulled his nails out,
put bamboo in his ass.

395
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,951
When you see John McCain,
that nigga walking like this.

396
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,871
He couldn't even salute.
"How you doing?" "Mm-hmm."

397
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:06,955
[laughter]

398
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,665
They fucked John up.

399
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,626
But what made him a man's man,

400
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:14,421
do you know John McCain was being tortured
for five years straight?

401
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:17,799
He could have got out early,
'cause his father was an admiral,

402
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,509
and they was gonna do a prisoner swap,

403
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,012
let him come home early
'cause of who his father was.

404
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:24,973
They came down to the torture chamber
to John McCain and said,

405
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,642
"Look, we've got some good news for you.

406
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,894
You're gonna be able to go home
and be with your family."

407
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:31,146
They released him and said,
"Come on. You're going home."

408
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,649
John McCain was like, "I'm not leaving."
"What you mean?"

409
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:37,653
"I'm not leaving unless you release
all the other soldiers in here with me."

410
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:38,737
[applause]

411
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,531
They said, "Hell no,"
and went back to whupping his ass. Pow!

412
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,867
[laughter]

413
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,827
I was in the military.
They showed us the tape.

414
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:49,122
They said, "This is the kind of prisoner
of war you should be if you're captured."

415
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,458
I said, "You might as well let me out,

416
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,294
'cause I'll never do that shit John did.

417
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,754
'Cause if they come to release me,

418
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:58,548
I'ma look at the rest of the soldiers
like, 'I'll see you later.

419
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:01,093
God has heard my prayer.

420
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,304
Give me a letter.
I'll give it to your family.

421
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:07,265
But my Black ass
is getting on this helicopter.

422
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:10,519
Somebody got to tell
what these Pacquiaos have done to us,

423
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,730
and God has chosen me.

424
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,190
Wouldn't he do it?'"

425
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:20,195
Hey, this ain't no joke right here.
I don't play with my health.

426
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:24,908
Your life is the most precious thing
you've got, 'cause life is short, man.

427
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,160
We losing some good-ass people.

428
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:32,207
Shit. We lost Cicely Tyson, 96 years old.

429
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,918
-Black people talking about "too soon."
-[clapping]

430
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:37,379
[laughter]

431
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,965
"Who knew?" I said, "I knew."

432
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:45,262
When she got 88, I said, "Ooh!
You better get your paperwork in order."

433
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,222
"Who knew?" I knew!

434
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,017
When she got 89, I said,
"The Lord looking for you."

435
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,352
"Who knew?" I knew.

436
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,854
When she got 92, I said:

437
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:59,651
♪ <i>Soon and very soon</i>
<i>You are gonna see the King</i> ♪

438
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:04,990
♪ <i>Soon and very soon</i>
<i>You are gonna see the King</i> ♪

439
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,702
When she got 94, I said,
"Don't go to church.

440
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:13,248
God's gonna say-- When he sees you there,
he's gonna say, 'Since you're here,

441
00:22:14,332 --> 00:22:16,126
stay right here.'"

442
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:18,378
I see some of y'all want to laugh.
Fuck y'all.

443
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,591
You want to laugh and celebrate
when they make it to 96.

444
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:26,261
That's when it's time to laugh
and tell jokes.

445
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:31,058
It ain't funny when you die at 26,
and that's our fucking problem.

446
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,852
I pay my respects all the time.

447
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,980
The one that broke my heart
more than anything

448
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,857
was when we lost Aretha Franklin,

449
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,193
the Queen of Soul.

450
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:45,155
Tried to pay my respects and watch
the funeral, but that funeral was so long.

451
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,033
I kept hollering at the TV, "Let her go.

452
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,284
[laughter]

453
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:51,495
She's supposed to be with the Lord."

454
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:54,372
That funeral was so long,
they turned off my cable.

455
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:58,168
I said, "This funeral done went through
two billing cycles."

456
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,879
They called me.
"Why didn't you pay your cable bill?"

457
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:02,380
I said, "I'm still at the funeral.

458
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,133
Let her go."

459
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,553
I've never seen a pastor
preach the whole Bible.

460
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,638
[laughter]

461
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:14,059
This nigga didn't miss a scripture.
I knew we was gonna be there a long time,

462
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:16,895
'cause the nigga done come out
talking about, "In the beginning."

463
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,189
I said, "The beginning?

464
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,485
What do Adam and Eve
got to do with a funeral?

465
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,988
Let her go.
She's supposed to be with the Lord."

466
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,241
CNN was there.
They was unplugging their shit.

467
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,159
"Come on. Let's get the fuck out of here.

468
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:33,703
We've been here for three weeks.

469
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:36,706
Don Lemon is supposed to be
on TV right now."

470
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:40,168
I kept hollering at the TV, "Let her go."

471
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,922
I knew it was long when Aretha got up
to change dresses.

472
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:45,423
[laughter]

473
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:49,219
"I'm gonna wear something different
in the second half of the funeral."

474
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:54,975
I said, "The second half?
Who has a halftime at a funeral?

475
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:58,979
Let her go.
She's supposed to be with the Lord."

476
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:03,233
That funeral was so long, nigga.
They held it in Detroit so long,

477
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:07,487
by the time she finally did make it
to the pearly gates to get into heaven,

478
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:11,032
an angel came to the door
and said, "God's gone.

479
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,911
You were supposed to be in here
three weeks ago.

480
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:17,622
He touched you on the 3rd. It's the 21st.

481
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:20,458
I know you're the queen,
but he's the king.

482
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:25,130
You just can't have the Lord
just waiting for you, Aretha.

483
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,549
This is no kind of respect.

484
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,551
You're gonna have to go to hell."

485
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,471
That would be fucked up, though,
if you made it to heaven,

486
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,891
but you fucked around
and got to the gate late.

487
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:41,396
You know, you look on the board, like,
"Ooh, my name up there. Shit, I made it."

488
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:44,399
You see some of your boys,
like, "Damn, you ain't get in.

489
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:48,862
Damn, man. I heard
it's gonna be hot where you going.

490
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,739
Told you to go to Bible study."

491
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:53,950
You're taking your time.
"Nigga, I got in."

492
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:56,328
And you get to the gate,
and you see 'em locking.

493
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,330
You're like, "Hold up, nigga, I'm here.

494
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:02,167
I ain't moving my foot.
I'm supposed to be in there.

495
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:06,963
You just can't lock a nigga out of here.
What kind of bullshit is this?

496
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:12,052
You ain't say what time you had to be
at the gate. This is some bullshit."

497
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:14,888
You be peeping in there.
"Ooh, it look nice in there.

498
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:19,684
Heaven's everything they say in the Bible.
Uh-uh. Nigga, I'm getting in."

499
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:22,604
You be like, "Come on, man.
This is bullshit.

500
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,065
I'm on Jesus's list."

501
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:30,320
You be like, "It real nice in there.
Did my mama make it?

502
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:32,948
Did she make it into heaven? She did?

503
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,741
Could you tell her I'm out here?

504
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:36,201
[laughter]

505
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:41,373
And tell her that angel right there
won't let me in. This is some bullshit."

506
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:44,417
If your mama came
and seen you was late getting to the gate,

507
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,336
she would cuss your ass out.

508
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:49,381
"The fuck wrong with you?
Got me using this kind of language.

509
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:52,050
You were late. Get your ass over there.
You were late getting in."

510
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:54,594
"I'm sorry. I was on time.
That was the angel.

511
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,471
He hates me and everything."

512
00:25:56,554 --> 00:26:00,225
"Get your ass over there while I go
find Jesus, see can I get you in.

513
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,603
Stand over there with the rest
of them heathens."

514
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:07,315
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."

515
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:11,820
You go back and stand on the side
with everybody else that couldn't get in.

516
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:16,074
"I think I'm getting in.

517
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:19,035
My mom been knowing Jesus her whole life.

518
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,495
[laughter]

519
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:22,872
I know she got a plus-one.

520
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:30,672
Your mama ain't get in?
She didn't? Not at all?

521
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,632
Man, I'm sorry to hear that.

522
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:36,845
I'll be-- I'm about to get in there.
I'ma get in.

523
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,681
When I get in there, you want me
to tell somebody you out here?

524
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:43,393
You don't know nobody that made it?

525
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:47,063
All the people you know, you don't
know nobody you think made it?

526
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:50,483
Nobody? That's fucked up.

527
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:55,447
Oh, here come Jesus with my mama.
I'll see you later, Joel Osteen."

528
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,782
[laughter]

529
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,668
"This is my Bible."

530
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:16,092
My son just turned 18 years old.

531
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:19,971
Best day of my life,
because he's one of the trios I have.

532
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:22,307
I have three kids, and he's the last.

533
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:25,143
Eighteen years old,
and as a man that's in his 50s,

534
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:27,479
when you see your kids get 18 years old,

535
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:30,231
that is your chance
for you to live your life.

536
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,525
-[applause]
-I tell my kids all the time,

537
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:36,237
"Once you turn 18,
our relationship has changed."

538
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,199
"How is that, Daddy?"
I said, "Let me explain.

539
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:44,162
I am no longer the provider.
I am the adviser.

540
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:50,377
So when you've got a problem now, I say,
'This is what I would do if I was you.'

541
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:54,089
But you was raised right, nigga.
Make good decisions.

542
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:57,342
Close the door so me
and your future stepmama can get busy."

543
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:02,263
No, man, when your kids become an adult,
it is your time to capture

544
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:06,059
the things that you wanted to do
that you sacrificed by raising them.

545
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:09,521
I tell people all the time,
kids are the most expensive thing

546
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:12,399
you will ever purchase,
to ever have in your life,

547
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:15,652
'cause they-- at the maximum,
they are dream killers.

548
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:20,073
At the minimum, nigga,
they are dream delayers.

549
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:24,494
'Cause you done put what you wanted to do
to facilitate their growth.

550
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:28,081
And when they get 18, it's your time
to do the things you need to do,

551
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:30,083
'cause you're in
the fourth quarter of your life.

552
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,209
But some of y'all don't.

553
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:35,338
Y'all still be in your kids' lives when
they're 18 as if they was an adolescent.

554
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:36,756
And I don't blame most of y'all,

555
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,926
because y'all let these kids
around here manipulate you.

556
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:41,928
Because them kids
throw their guilt on you.

557
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:44,889
They've been in your life
and seen some of the times

558
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:48,852
when you was at your lowest point,
and they throw that shit in your face.

559
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:52,814
They also know there's things you wanted
to do for them that you couldn't do,

560
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,734
and you feel guilty,
and they play that shit on you.

561
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,445
And I'm telling you right now,
from the bottom of my heart,

562
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,155
fuck these kids.

563
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,740
[laughter]

564
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,784
Don't you let these motherfuckers
fuck with you.

565
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:09,247
I'ma tell you right now. If you did
everything to the best of your ability

566
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:13,001
to provide for your kids,
you are a great-ass parent.

567
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:16,588
Don't you let these little motherfuckers
make you feel bad.

568
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:20,425
I'm telling you right goddamn now.

569
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:24,137
I wish one of my kids
would tell me I'm not a great-ass father.

570
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,222
I only got one question for 'em:

571
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:30,810
"If I'm not a great father, nigga,
who are you comparing me to?

572
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:34,773
Who is this mythological Black man
you think gonna make the sacrifices I did

573
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,774
and all this for you like I did?

574
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:40,236
Take you to all these activities,
go to your basketball game,

575
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,907
be there for three hours,
and your ass don't even get in the game.

576
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,200
[laughter]

577
00:29:45,783 --> 00:29:48,119
Me and you sitting on the bench.

578
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:51,623
You could have FaceTimed me this bullshit,

579
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:54,751
sitting over there
like you're assistant coach and shit.

580
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:59,088
Since we're comparing,
you ain't a good-ass child.

581
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:02,675
Almost lost my job fucking with your ass."

582
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:04,844
Fuck these kids.

583
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:08,139
These ain't jokes.

584
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:11,142
I had the time to spend time with my son,
and it made me learn

585
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,561
that our kids are not built like us.

586
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:17,398
My son don't have no swag.
Zero. Nada. None.

587
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,567
I told him the other day,
"Let's ride, Clyde."

588
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,861
This nigga was like, "Who's Clyde, Daddy?"

589
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,947
"Get your ass in the car."

590
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:29,744
"I just want to know who Clyde is.
Is he a friend of yours?"

591
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,454
"No, nigga. You're Clyde."

592
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:34,791
"Mm-mmm. My name's Nathaniel."

593
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,918
"Open your mouth. Let me swab you."

594
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:41,673
You gotta understand. You can't raise
your kids the way you was raised.

595
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:47,095
It does not apply. The way we was raised
does not have nothing to do with our kids.

596
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:52,475
You gotta understand that we are
inner-city parents raising suburban kids,

597
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,811
so all the things we went through
does not apply

598
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:57,355
to these little, soft motherfuckers
we're dealing with.

599
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,817
You put your hands on your kids,
just one of the ass whuppings

600
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,278
that your mother and father gave you,
put it on your kid,

601
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,863
you'll scar these little,
soft motherfuckers for life.

602
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,742
They can't do it.
I just tried to punish my son.

603
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:13,162
Sent him to his room.
This nigga writes a suicide note.

604
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,833
He be in there. "Daddy, I don't know
how long I can take this shit.

605
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,127
The walls are coming in on me."

606
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,796
I said, "This nigga
could never go to jail."

607
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:25,300
He can't even stay in his own room
with an Xbox.

608
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,511
These ain't jokes.

609
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:32,348
My son got a concussion
from falling in grass.

610
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,060
He was in the hospital for three weeks.

611
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:39,230
"Hey, what happened to him?"
I said, "He tripped out back."

612
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:41,899
They ain't built like us.

613
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:46,070
You buy 'em a bike, you gotta get
a helmet, shoulder pads, knee pads.

614
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,948
"You playing football or riding a bike,
motherfucker?"

615
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,618
They're not built like us.

616
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:56,289
We used to go to the park,
get on the swing set, and wrap the pole.

617
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,209
Let one of these kids go to a swing set
and try to wrap the pole.

618
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:02,295
Come back, chain around their neck.

619
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:03,421
[laughter]

620
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:04,631
[imitates crying]

621
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:07,133
And you're like,
"Get your ass down from there."

622
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:10,345
"Why? You said go around"--
"Get your motherfucking ass"…

623
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:13,181
They're not built like us.

624
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,600
Can't leave 'em in the car when it's hot.

625
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,518
[laughter]

626
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,689
Our mother left us in the car
when it was hot.

627
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,567
We were just smart enough
to get the fuck out

628
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,529
and look at the door to see
when she coming out.

629
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,741
"Oh, here she come.
Get back in the car. Get back.

630
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:33,451
That's right. I was sitting over here.

631
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:36,245
You're right. You're right.
I was over here. You're right."

632
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,747
Fuck her!

633
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,709
It don't take you no three hours
getting no tuna fish.

634
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,672
Our kids just stay in the car and die.
[grunts]

635
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:48,007
"Get your ass out of the car!"

636
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:51,552
"You said, 'Don't get out.'"
"It's 200 degrees, motherfucker."

637
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:02,605
Die in the car, stupid motherfuckers.

638
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,024
Fuck these kids.

639
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:07,360
But you ain't got to put
your hands on no kids.

640
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:09,278
Your kids ain't doing
what they supposed to do,

641
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:10,988
I've done found their Achilles' heel.

642
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:14,742
I know exactly what you can get,
how you can get 'em

643
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,328
if they ain't doing what the fuck
they supposed to do.

644
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,330
Found their weakness.

645
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,040
No, it ain't the phone. No.

646
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:25,211
All you need to do,
turn that motherfucking Wi-Fi off.

647
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:26,879
