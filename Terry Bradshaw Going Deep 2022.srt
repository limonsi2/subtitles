was going in the air,

782
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:44,266

that Italian army

795
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,466

I'm sitting down,

and I hear this roar,

803
00:32:26,233 --> 00:32:29,600

"Golly. You son of a gun.

00:42:35,466 --> 00:42:37,700
How long do you think
it took me, R.P.?

1034
00:42:37,766 --> 00:42:39,800
- Five hours.
- It took four.

1035
00:42:39,866 --> 00:42:41,400
[laughter]
Four hours.

1036
00:42:41,466 --> 00:42:43,566
I was in and out.

1037
00:42:43,633 --> 00:42:48,700
And out of that session,
believe it or not,

1038
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:53,500
came a song that I recorded

1039
00:42:53,566 --> 00:42:56,833
that went to number nine
on Billboard--

1040
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:00,100
Billboard magazine's chart,
which was a shocker.

- I have a question for you.

1077
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,166
If you had a chance
to go back in time...

1078
00:45:22,233 --> 00:45:23,933
- Yeah.
- To one day in your life...

1079
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,766
- Right.
- When would that be and why?

1080
00:45:26,833 --> 00:45:28,066
- One day in my life,

1081
00:45:28,133 --> 00:45:30,433
if I could go back
and change anything.

1082
00:45:31,466 --> 00:45:33,300
Golly.

1083
00:45:33,366 --> 00:45:34,300
[sighs]

1084
00:45:34,366 --> 00:45:36,566
Well, if I could start
with wife number one

1085
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:37,600
and cancel that.

1086
00:45:37,666 --> 00:45:38,700

[rim shot]

1088
00:45:40,433 --> 00:45:43,366
Move on to wife number two,
eliminate that one.

1089
00:45:43,433 --> 00:45:45,466
[laughter]
- Whoo!

1090
00:45:45,533 --> 00:45:47,466
[rim shot]

1091
00:45:47,533 --> 00:45:50,666
And wife number three
cleaned my plow.

1092
00:45:50,733 --> 00:45:51,833
[rim shot]

1093
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:53,666
That's three back-in-times

1094
00:45:53,733 --> 00:45:56,600
I'd like to eliminate
right there.

1095
00:45:56,666 --> 00:45:59,833
I--that's such a good question,
sweetheart.

1096
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,833
<i>Divorced three times.</i>

1097
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:05,100
<i>Very embarrassed</i>
<i>and ashamed of that.</i>

1098
00:46:05,166 --> 00:46:07,766
<i>My first wife, I married--</i>

1099
00:46:07,833 --> 00:46:10,300
it's embarrassing,
but I will say it--

1100
00:46:10,366 --> 00:46:14,666
was the fact that I'd come home
from the football season,

1101
00:46:14,733 --> 00:46:17,933
I was going through one
of my periods of depression

1102
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
that I didn't even know I had,

1103
00:46:20,066 --> 00:46:22,366
and I was--I was angry.

1104
00:46:22,433 --> 00:46:24,533
I was hateful.

1105
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,866
I didn't know I was in--
going through a depression.

1106
00:46:27,933 --> 00:46:29,233
I called this girl and--

1107
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,500
wonderful girl, not her fault.

1108
00:46:31,566 --> 00:46:33,400
<i>And I said,</i>
<i>"Let's get married,"</i>

1109
00:46:33,466 --> 00:46:34,833
<i>and we got married.</i>

1110
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,266
<i>And the minute</i>
<i>I'm walking down the aisle,</i>

1111
00:46:36,333 --> 00:46:38,333
I said, "Oh, my God."

1112
00:46:40,066 --> 00:46:42,100
"This is just wrong."

1113
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:45,833
And I said, "Oh, my God,
what have I done?"

1114
00:46:47,133 --> 00:46:50,233
A year later, not even that,
it was over.

1115
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:53,166
Then I met JoJo Starbuck,
the ice skater.

1116
00:46:53,233 --> 00:46:54,566
<i>[classical music]</i>

1117
00:46:54,633 --> 00:46:57,533
<i>And what I saw in her,</i>
<i>I think,</i>

1118
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:01,000
<i>was she was a star.</i>

1119
00:47:01,066 --> 00:47:03,366
<i>And so there</i>
<i>was excitement there.</i>

1120
00:47:03,433 --> 00:47:06,333
<i>She was a bigger star</i>
<i>than I was, you know?</i>

1121
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,333
<i>And she was an athlete,</i>
<i>Olympic skater.</i>

1122
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,300
<i>- He asked me to marry him,</i>
<i>and I said,</i>

1123
00:47:13,366 --> 00:47:16,566
"Well, I couldn't possibly
tell you before Christmastime."

1124
00:47:16,633 --> 00:47:20,166
This is, like, in September,
and, uh...

1125
00:47:20,233 --> 00:47:22,700
- October.
- No, September.

1126
00:47:22,766 --> 00:47:26,033
And then three weeks later,
I said, "Yes, yes, yes."

1127
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:32,766
- I can't tell you today...

1128
00:47:32,833 --> 00:47:37,200
whether or not
I was in love with her.

1129
00:47:37,266 --> 00:47:39,366
<i>I thought I was.</i>

1130
00:47:39,433 --> 00:47:42,233
<i>I do recall telling my father</i>
<i>after the wedding,</i>

1131
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,466
<i>I said, "Dad, I've never been</i>
<i>so happy in my life."</i>

1132
00:47:44,533 --> 00:47:47,333
<i>He says, "Great, son.</i>
<i>I'm proud of you."</i>

1133
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,700
And then six weeks later,
she leaves and flies off to LA,

1134
00:47:50,766 --> 00:47:53,033
and she can't stand the ranch,

1135
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:54,833
<i>and she was gone</i>
<i>the whole time.</i>

1136
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,033
'Cause I don't have anyone
to cook for me,

1137
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:57,500
and I'm not
a very good cook myself.

1138
00:47:57,566 --> 00:47:59,000
- You don't have anybody
to cook for you?

1139
00:47:59,066 --> 00:48:00,100
- No.
- what do you mean?

1140
00:48:00,166 --> 00:48:02,133
- Well, I'm home, uh--
I'm home alone.

1141
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,300
- A lot?
- Quite a bit.

1142
00:48:04,366 --> 00:48:05,933
- You leave...
- [laughs] But I'm happy.

1143
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,466
I'm happy while I'm,
you know...

1144
00:48:07,533 --> 00:48:09,433
[laughter]
- Thank you.

1145
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:12,433
- And then, um,
filed for divorce.

1146
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,766
I was in a quarterback meeting,

1147
00:48:13,833 --> 00:48:15,633
and the sheriff
brought me the papers

1148
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,066
while I was in
a quarterback meeting,

1149
00:48:17,133 --> 00:48:20,500
which highly pissed me off.

1150
00:48:20,566 --> 00:48:24,766
<i>And then we played</i>
<i>a preseason game.</i>

1151
00:48:24,833 --> 00:48:28,866
And I thought I was handling it
pretty well.

1152
00:48:28,933 --> 00:48:30,600
And right before half,

1153
00:48:30,666 --> 00:48:33,933
<i>I'd just thrown a pass</i>
<i>and just got decked.</i>

1154
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,933
And it just stunned me,
and so everybody came out

1155
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,566
to make sure I was all right.

1156
00:48:38,633 --> 00:48:42,000
<i>And when they sat me up,</i>
<i>I lost it.</i>

1157
00:48:42,066 --> 00:48:44,033
<i>I just started bawling.</i>

1158
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:49,433
That was, um, not a good deal.

1159
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:53,866
And so she divorced me, and--

1160
00:48:53,933 --> 00:48:56,166
and, uh--[clears throat]

1161
00:48:56,233 --> 00:49:01,766
And then Charlotte,
the wife of my kids,

1162
00:49:01,833 --> 00:49:05,033
was--was something
that started good.

1163
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:08,033
<i>And then she wanted</i>
<i>to go to law school.</i>

1164
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:11,033
<i>And then law became what</i>
<i>I thought was more important</i>

1165
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:12,966
than anything else.

1166
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:15,400
And I was pissed about that.

1167
00:49:15,466 --> 00:49:19,466
And I--I vented it, and, uh,

1168
00:49:19,533 --> 00:49:22,000
I told her, you know,
I told her one day,

1169
00:49:22,066 --> 00:49:24,866
I said, "You keep ignoring me,
I'm gonna have an affair.

1170
00:49:24,933 --> 00:49:27,433
I'm just telling you right now
I'm gonna have an affair."

1171
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,433
And I did.

1172
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:32,366
We had nothing--
nothing in common.

1173
00:49:32,433 --> 00:49:33,766
Zero in common.

1174
00:49:33,833 --> 00:49:35,266
We don't have anything
in common today.

1175
00:49:35,333 --> 00:49:37,633
We have two great kids,
and that's it, so...

1176
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:40,666
<i>I already told you</i>
<i>how immature I was.</i>

1177
00:49:40,733 --> 00:49:45,033
<i>Those are three good examples</i>
<i>of being extremely immature.</i>

1178
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:48,100
[applause]

1179
00:49:49,333 --> 00:49:50,733
Took my chair.

1180
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,666
That's something I'm used to,

1181
00:49:52,733 --> 00:49:54,266
a woman taking away
my possessions.

1182
00:49:54,333 --> 00:49:56,166
[laughter]
[rim shot]

1183
00:49:56,233 --> 00:49:58,100
[laughs]

1184
00:49:58,166 --> 00:50:01,033
That's cute.
Don't you think that's cute?

1185
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:02,300
I like that.

1186
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:03,466
A lot of guys
are out there going,

1187
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:05,600
"Yeah, yeah, I know what
you're talking about."

1188
00:50:06,733 --> 00:50:10,300
After the third--
the third wife,

1189
00:50:10,366 --> 00:50:12,066
I was an emotional wreck.

1190
00:50:12,133 --> 00:50:13,500
And when you've been divorced

1191
00:50:13,566 --> 00:50:15,566
and you've got children
involved,

1192
00:50:15,633 --> 00:50:17,633
it's not a happy place.

1193
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,233
Um, not a happy place at all.

1194
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:22,733
And I just said,
"That's just too much.

1195
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,666
I can't go through this
again in life."

1196
00:50:24,733 --> 00:50:27,300
So I sought out help...

1197
00:50:27,366 --> 00:50:30,500
and went to therapy
for a long time

1198
00:50:30,566 --> 00:50:32,800
to figure out what the hell's
wrong with me.

1199
00:50:32,866 --> 00:50:36,700
We tend to wanna st--

1200
00:50:36,766 --> 00:50:39,900
bury everything,
'cause if you admit that

1201
00:50:39,966 --> 00:50:41,700
you're dealing with depression,

1202
00:50:41,766 --> 00:50:44,400
then what you're also admitting
is you have a weakness.

1203
00:50:44,466 --> 00:50:47,400
It is not a weakness.
It is a disease.

1204
00:50:47,466 --> 00:50:50,033
It's not--
it's out of your control.

1205
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:53,633
And when I went to therapy
and learned that,

1206
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:56,066
"It's okay, Terry.
It's not you.

1207
00:50:56,133 --> 00:50:58,366
It's the way God made you."

1208
00:50:58,433 --> 00:51:01,733
And when I started
going through that,

1209
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,000
then I started saying, "Okay."

1210
00:51:04,066 --> 00:51:08,666
Um, one of the things
that I learned was,

1211
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:10,466
after football season
especially,

1212
00:51:10,533 --> 00:51:12,333
is when I'm most vulnerable.

1213
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,533
'Cause I would come off
of maybe not a great year,

1214
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,233
but maybe, you know,
maybe a Super Bowl year,

1215
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:21,400
and then I'd sink way down.

1216
00:51:21,466 --> 00:51:23,733
And it would take me forever,

1217
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:28,633
forever to get happy, you know?

1218
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:34,800
I never could--
I never could find my escape.

1219
00:51:34,866 --> 00:51:37,500
I couldn't find my comfort

1220
00:51:37,566 --> 00:51:40,166
to go and relax
and enjoy myself.

1221
00:51:40,233 --> 00:51:43,400
And it--and it just built.

1222
00:51:43,466 --> 00:51:45,500
You know, it's like
right now, talking about it,

1223
00:51:45,566 --> 00:51:47,100
I'm getting a headache
talking about it.

1224
00:51:47,166 --> 00:51:50,866
It's not--this isn't a good
moment for me right now.

1225
00:51:50,933 --> 00:51:53,600
Why would anybody care
that I deal with depression,

1226
00:51:53,666 --> 00:51:56,233
clinical depression?

1227
00:51:58,533 --> 00:52:00,800
Yeah, I have to get past that.

1228
00:52:00,866 --> 00:52:02,433
When I talked about it,

1229
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:06,633
a dear friend of mine
just made fun of me like crazy,

1230
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:10,466
and it--it set me back.

1231
00:52:10,533 --> 00:52:11,866
"Well, I don't want
to do that anymore.

1232
00:52:11,933 --> 00:52:14,700
I don't want to be laughed at."

1233
00:52:14,766 --> 00:52:17,400
I've had friends of mine--
I love them to death--

1234
00:52:17,466 --> 00:52:19,833
but they saw
an interview I did.

1235
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:22,266
And they know who they are.
I won't mention their names.

1236
00:52:22,333 --> 00:52:24,300
And if they watch this,

1237
00:52:24,366 --> 00:52:26,166
hear me loud and clear.

1238
00:52:26,233 --> 00:52:29,466
If they watch this, this one
person is gonna make fun of me

1239
00:52:29,533 --> 00:52:31,300
for saying
what I've just been--

1240
00:52:31,366 --> 00:52:32,566
he's gonna do it.

1241
00:52:32,633 --> 00:52:34,466
He can't help himself.

1242
00:52:34,533 --> 00:52:37,666
But I did this interview,
and I broke down.

1243
00:52:37,733 --> 00:52:39,766
I even begged the doctor
at the hospital.

1244
00:52:39,833 --> 00:52:41,666
I said, "Put me out
for three days.

1245
00:52:41,733 --> 00:52:42,733
Please put--"

1246
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,100

talking about this.

1248
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:49,866

it's--you're a role model
for that.

1268
