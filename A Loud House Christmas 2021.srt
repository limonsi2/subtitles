00:06:57,982 --> 00:06:59,201
Does anyone else
hear that ringing?

179
00:06:59,244 --> 00:07:01,464
- Oh, it's Lori.
- Hi, Mom.

180
00:07:01,508 --> 00:07:04,119
- Lori.
- Lori?

181
00:07:04,162 --> 00:07:06,077
I want to talk to Lori.
- Lori!

182
00:07:06,121 --> 00:07:08,036
- I miss you so much!
- Hi, Lori!

183
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:10,473
- Hi, Lori!
- Lori!

184
00:07:10,517 --> 00:07:11,518
Lori!

185
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,869
What time are you
coming home today?

186
00:07:14,912 --> 00:07:16,392
- That's actually
why I'm calling.

187
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,612
I've given it a lot of thought,
and I don't think

188
00:07:18,655 --> 00:07:19,743
I can come home
for Christmas this year.

189
00:07:19,787 --> 00:07:21,223
- What?

190
00:07:21,266 --> 00:07:23,399
- Exams are coming up,
and I have

191
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,010
a winter golf tournament
two days after Christmas.

192
00:07:26,054 --> 00:07:28,186
It just feels like too much
to go all the way home

193
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,797
just to turn around
and come all the way back.

194
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,147
- Oh, well,

195
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,410
Christmas just wouldn't
be the same without you.

196
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,760
- Yeah,
it sure wouldn't, kiddo.

197
00:07:36,804 --> 00:07:39,067
- I think it'd be easier
just to go to Bobby's house.

198
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:43,114
- Okay, hon.
We understand.

199
00:07:43,158 --> 00:07:45,029
- We support you, sweetie.
- What?

200
00:07:45,073 --> 00:07:46,422
- Incoming.
- Duck!

201
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,685
- Lincoln.
- No, don't do that!

202
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:51,993
Don't support her.
This is totally unacceptable!

203
00:07:52,036 --> 00:07:53,516
Am I right, everyone?

204
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,476
- Well, actually,
it makes more sense.

205
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,738
It does.

206
00:07:57,781 --> 00:07:59,391
- I mean,
Bobby does live closer,

207
00:07:59,435 --> 00:08:01,742
and, you know,
we live so far away.

208
00:08:01,785 --> 00:08:04,179
- Thanks, Mom and Dad,
for being so understanding.

209
00:08:04,222 --> 00:08:06,747
Dad, are you crying?
- Lori, please.

210
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,532
You have to come home.
You'll miss everything.

211
00:08:09,576 --> 00:08:12,056
- I know, Lincoln.
This wasn't an easy decision.

212
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,755
- But what about Lily lighting
the Royal Woods Christmas tree?

213
00:08:14,798 --> 00:08:15,712
- Light tree.

214
00:08:15,756 --> 00:08:17,540
all: Aww.

215
00:08:17,584 --> 00:08:19,237
- And what about
Christmas morning?

216
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:21,196
I bought us
the best Christmas gift ever.

217
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:23,807
But if you're not here,
it won't be the same.

218
00:08:23,851 --> 00:08:25,505
It can't be the same.

219
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:27,419
Oh, Lincoln.
You're so sweet.

220
00:08:27,463 --> 00:08:28,551
I will see your Christmas gift

221
00:08:28,595 --> 00:08:29,813
when I come home
for the summer.

222
00:08:29,857 --> 00:08:30,814
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

223
00:08:30,858 --> 00:08:33,208
- Yeah.
- Summer?

224
00:08:33,251 --> 00:08:35,906
- Perhaps now would
be the best time to tell you.

225
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,169
Sam invited me to go skiing
with her and her family

226
00:08:38,213 --> 00:08:40,563
on Christmas Day,
and I really want to go.

227
00:08:40,607 --> 00:08:43,479
Can I?
- No, you can't go.

228
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,787
- That is very kind
of Sam's family to invite you.

229
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:49,529
- All right, Luna.
Yeah, of course, you can go.

230
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:52,488
- Yes.
- So fun.

231
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,447
- Uh, well, I've been asked
to bring merriment and cheer

232
00:08:55,491 --> 00:08:57,319
to the Sunset Canyon
Retirement Home.

233
00:08:57,362 --> 00:09:01,018
Luan and Mr. Coconuts
coming at you Christmas Day.

234
00:09:01,062 --> 00:09:03,412
Pretty, uh, sweet deal.

235
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:05,022
- Tell Pop Pop I said,
"Merry Christmas."

236
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:06,894
- Absolutely not.

237
00:09:06,937 --> 00:09:08,678
- Luan, I think that's
a very kind thing you're doing

238
00:09:08,722 --> 00:09:10,724
at the old folks home.
- It sure is, kiddo.

239
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:13,030

This is Christmas.

240

- Okay, Lori,

241
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:17,426
I think we're gonna say
so long for now.

242
00:09:17,469 --> 00:09:18,906
- Bye, everyone.
I love you.

243
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:20,385
I will call on Christmas Day.
- Lori, no!

244

Family meeting.

Now, listen, we know
this isn't the Christmas

248
00:09:31,396 --> 00:09:34,922
we were expecting
with Lori, Luan, and Luna gone.

249
00:09:34,965 --> 00:09:37,794
- We just have to make
the best of the situation.

250
00:09:37,838 --> 00:09:40,275
- Tell them, Mom.
We need to fix the situation.

251
00:09:40,318 --> 00:09:42,843
- Wouldn't it be fun
to take a trip?

252
00:09:42,886 --> 00:09:44,061
- A trip?
- A trip?

253

- On Christmas?

254
00:09:45,672 --> 00:09:47,630
- With three of the kids
gone already,

255
00:09:47,674 --> 00:09:50,459
maybe we could be our crazy,
old spontaneous selves.

256

Get up super early
Christmas morning,

the remaining kids on a trip

- Go on.

259

to vacation in Miami.

- Dad, no.
- Bikinis!

264

- Miami is where

265
00:10:11,915 --> 00:10:13,656
the Little Miss Citrus
Pageant takes place.

266
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,398
- We could go
to a Miami Dolphins game.

267
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:19,444
- The moisture will do wonders
for Hops' scales.

268
00:10:19,488 --> 00:10:21,229
- We could witness
a shark attack.

our Loud family traditions?

All those special things
that we do together

274

as a family on Christmas Day?

If we're all split up,
it won't feel like Christmas.

276
00:10:40,204 --> 00:10:42,946

you're disappointed, honey,

but sometimes plans,
they change.

278

Roll with the punches, right?

279

Besides, we'll start
new family traditions.

on Christmas Eve.

- Light tree.
- Aw.

283
00:10:57,004 --> 00:10:58,570

new family traditions.

284
00:10:58,614 --> 00:11:00,703
I want
our old family traditions

286

have a great family Christmas
