3
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,500
I found this necklace by the tree.

4
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,000
Okay.

5
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,500
OFFICER MILLER: You found the body, Mrs Clark.

6
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,000
Yes.

7
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And you knew the dead girl, is that right Chloe?

8
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yes, that’s right. I spoke to her a few times.

9
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,500
OFFICER MILLER: Where?

10
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,250
Out here.

11
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,500
What was she doing?

12
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,250
She said she was communing.

13
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,000
She said the countryside was her church.

14
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
She was really nice.

15
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,500
Did she tell you her name?

16
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,250
Sarah!

17
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,000
MILLER: Just Sarah?

18
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,500
That’s all she said.

19
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,500
Is that all?

20
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,500
Yes, thank you.

21
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,200
SUTTON: Dave!

22
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,000
Mike!

23
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What have we got?

24
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,500
Female, aged about 21.

25
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,500
Been dead for less than 24 hours.

26
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,000
People at the house found her this morning.

27
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The land here used to be a small farm.

28
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's pretty wild now.

29
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We found her necklace over by the tree.

30
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,500
Looks like the body was moved from there to here.

31
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,500
Any clues to the cause of death?

32
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,250
Only this.

33
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,000
What else?

34
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,300
More severe burning across the inner thighs and abdomen.

35
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,500
Pathology’s not goIng to find anything.

36
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,000
My thoughts exactly.

37
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,500
Same as the others.

38
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,500
You okay?

39
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,000
Come here. Come here.

40
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Panic attack?

41
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Okay, okay. You know what to do.

42
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Breathe in quickly.

43
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Out slowly.

44
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Breathe in quickly.

45
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Out slowly.

46
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,500
Did you take your beta blocker?

47
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,000
Okay.

48
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Do you want a Diazepam?

49
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
No, they make me drowsy in the morning.

50
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Okay, okay, it’s all right.

51
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
That’s it.

52
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Come on, lie down.

53
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Feeling better?

54
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Was it a bad dream?

55
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
No. Just woke, and there it was.

56
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Like ants under my skin

57
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,500
and this growing sense like I’m gonna die.

58
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,800
Shhhh!

59
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,800
You’re okay.

60
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You’re okay now.

61
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,500
Maybe you should go and see a doctor.

62
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,500
No point.

63
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,000
But you were so much better before…

64
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,500
...before Sarah died.

65
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,000
I know.

66
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
But that was a year ago and since then

67
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,500
you’ve been having these attacks again.

68
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,500
I know!

69
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,550
I just want you to be -

70
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,500
Normal?

71
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,000
Better.

72
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I will be...

73
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
...if I can just know what happened to Sarah.

74
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
If the police had solved her murder…

75
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,300
But there’s nothing you can do about it now.

76
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,500
There is.

77
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,000
There might be.

78
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Oh, you’re not talking about that spirit medium thing.

79
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,500
Leah recommended her.

80
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,500
It’s all bullshit.

81
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,000
You don’t know that.

82
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Anyway...

83
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
...I’ll be late home after work.

84
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,100
REBECCA: Sarah?

85
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,750
Sarah?

86
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,200
There’s one here who loves you.

87
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,000
REBECCA: Your sister.

88
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,500
Your twin, Emma.

89
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,000
Come closer.

90
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
REBECCA: Closer.

91
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,000
Sarah’s here.

92
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,500
Speak to her.

93
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,500
Sarah!

94
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,500
Are you at peace?

95
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,000
She is.

96
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,500
But she wants you to be at peace too.

97
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,000
I try, Sarah, but...!

98
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I miss you so much. I just want to know...

99
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,500
...what happened!

100
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Sarah, I know you’re tired. Can’t you stay a little longer?

101
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,500
Sarah!

102
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,000
Sarah!

103
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,800
It was a good beginning.

104
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,900
Can't you bring her back?

105
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,000
It's too soon.

106
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
We can’t know the energy it takes

107
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,750
for those who have passed through the veil

108
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,500
to look back through it.

109
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,000
And it takes its toll me on me, too.

110
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
We’ll try again.

111
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Tomorrow?

112
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I can’t tomorrow. I have another reading.

113
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I can only manage one a day.

114
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Next week.

115
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
How much do I owe?

116
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Nothing.

117
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Hi Tess.

118
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,500
I was just wondering if Emma was home yet.

119
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,000
Er, no, she’s not back yet.

120
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,500
I tried calling her.

121
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,000
She’s probably driving.

122
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Yes, I’m just wondering...

123
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,900
...have you heard how it went?

124
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,000
Leave him alone...

125
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I’ve no idea.

126
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,300
...and wait till Emma calls.

127
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,500
Can you get her to ring me?

128
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,200
Okay.

129
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,200
Okay. Bye.

130
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,800
Hi mum. I was driving.

131
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,700
Oh, you’re not driving now, are you?

132
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,000
No mum. I just got here.

133
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Well? How did it go?

134
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Nothing much happened.

135
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So something happened.

136
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I’m a bit washed out. I'll call you.

137
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,500
Call me tomorrow -

138
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,500
Well, it would help if you cared.

139
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,000
Do you want a drink?

140
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,750
No, you’re all right.

141
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,500
Mum called.

142
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,000
Called me too.

143
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
She wanted to know - you know.

144
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,500
Yeah!

145
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,500
Well, don’t you want to know?

146
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,000
What I want is for you to move on.

147
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You and your mum.

148
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,500
Well, that's all I want. That's why I'm -

149
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,000
Paying someone to tell you what you want to hear.

150
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,500
She wouldn't take my money.

151
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,750
She will.

152
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,500
I'm going to bed

153
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Emma, I’m sorry.

154
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,500
You’ve got to let me do this.

155
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,000
I just worry that this is something

156
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,500
that’s going to give you false information,

157
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,500
you know, false hope.

158
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,500
If it’s false then all I’ve lost is one evening,

159
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,000
maybe two of my life.

160
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
If not...

161
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,500
...at last I’ll find out who killed Sarah.

162
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,000
I just wish the police had done their job.

163
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Then let me do what I can.

164
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I’m so sorry.

165
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I just...

166
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,800
Sometimes I just feel like I don’t know what to do for you.

167
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,000
I know.

168
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I know it’s not easy for you dealing with the anxiety

169
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
and the attacks.

170
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,500
Sometimes I feel guilty for letting you take all this on

171
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,500
when we got together.

172
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,500
No. I knew what I was doing.

173
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,500
Okay, I didn’t know anything about panic attacks

174
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,500
but you told me you had them

175
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,000
and I fancied you so much that...

176
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
that didn’t matter.

177
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,500
And then I fell for you and…

178
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,500
...here we are.

179
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I hope you're in the mood.

180
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,500
Emma?

181
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,000
Sarah!

182
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
He was...he was killing her.

183
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
No, it was just a dream.

184
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,500
I saw her die.

185
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,000
No, you're just having a panic attack.

186
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,500
His hands around her neck...

187
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,500
...the detective.

188
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,500
Well that just proves it was just a dream.

189
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,000
I think she was trying to show me.

190
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,500
Okay, just breathe in quickly...

191
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,500
...out slowly.

192
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,000
It wasn't a panic attack. It was...

193
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Okay, okay, just lie down. Just lie down. You're fine.

194
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,250
Okay...okay...

195
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,500
It's all right, It's fine,

196
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,500
SAM - Coffee?

197
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,000
Mmmm.

198
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Look -

199
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I know what you’re going to say so don't.

200
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Okay, but can I say it anyway?

201
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,300
Why don’t we go away? Anywhere you fancy.

202
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,000
Oh!

203
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I thought you were going to tell me not to see Rebecca again.

204
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,700
Well, we haven’t had a holiday in like over a year.

205
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,850
I don’t know if I can get the time off.

206
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:58,500
Ask.

207
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,800
What about you?

208
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,000
Won’t be a problem.

209
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Okay.

210
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,500
Okay.

211
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,500
So, how’d it go?

212
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,200
What?

213
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,000
With Rebecca.

214
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,500
Christ, Leah, let me get a coffee first.

215
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You really need decaf.

216
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,200
What’s the point?

217
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,100
Caffeine’s bad for you.

218
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,200
You don’t drink decaf.

219
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,000
I’m insensitive.

220
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
So, what happened with Rebecca?

221
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,300
I don’t think I’m going to see her again.

222
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,500
What?

223
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,000
Sam thinks…

224
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,500
No, actually I think I need to move on.

225
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,500
So you’ll do what Sam says.

226
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,000
It’s causing problems.

227
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Life is full of fucking problems.

228
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,800
Maybe he’s right.

229
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,000
He’s fucking wrong.

230
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,500
You want to know who murdered your sister,

231
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,000
and the police know fuck all.

232
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,500
I don’t know.

233
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,500
JESS: Morning.

234
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,000
Morning.

235
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,500
Mail!

236
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,000
You’ve just not been yourself lately.

237
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I don’t know what myself is.

238
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,500
I’m talking about the panic attacks.

239
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,000
I had them before. I thought they’d stopped.

240
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
You never said.

241
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Did you get treatment?

242
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,500
I saw a psychologist.

243
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,000
Did it help?

244
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,500
He taught me relaxation and gave me cognitive therapy.

245
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,000
Well, whatever that is, it clearly didn’t work.

246
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,500
Look at the state of you now.

247
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,000
Yeah, I know. I’m a basket case!

248
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,000
It stopped but…since Sarah, it’s come back.

249
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,500
You’re telling me.

250
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,000
Somedays when you come in it's like

251
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
you’ve fought a battle between the car park and here.

252
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
The first time I thought you were going to actually fucking die

253
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
and that gave me a panic attack.

254
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
That for you is just panic.

255
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
A real panic attack is…

256
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,100
You’re anxious and you’ve got this feeling of worry all the time.

257
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,500
Like when you take your driving test,

258
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,000
or you’re in the waiting room of the dentist

259
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
and your stomach feels scrambled,

260
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
and it’s like that.

261
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,500
And you feel worried, but you’re not actually

262
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,000
but you don’t know why you feel like that anyway.

263
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And then when you're doing whatever you’re doing

264
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
whether it’s watching telly or walking,

265
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
you get this feeling

266
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,500
and it gets worse and it spreads all through your body,

267
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,000
and you heart is pounding

268
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
and your breath gets hard and you feel like…

269
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
...like you’re going to die.

270
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
So what do you do?

271
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I find time to do relaxation every day.

272
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
It helps but…

273
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
...since Sarah...

274
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
...it never went away. I just managed it...but...

275
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
...now I can't.

276
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,750
Hey, come on.

277
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:19,000
Sometimes I feel like I’m the one that should have died.

278
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Sarah and I were identical in every way.

279
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Things that made us laugh,

280
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
the food we ate,

281
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,500
but not our clothes though,

282
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,000
or our hair.

283
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
She had something I didn’t have, and I had something she didn’t have.

284
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,750
What do you mean?

285
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,880
She had what my dad had -

286
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,000
the ability not to worry, to not let things get to him.

287
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,750
Sarah was the sea of calm.

288
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,500
Me? I took after my mum.

289
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:54,000
She’s anxious. She can get herself into such a state,

290
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
and that’s her gift to me, only with me it was worse -

291
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
has been since I was thirteen.

292
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
A few years ago I got treatment but…

293
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,500
...now it’s come back.

294
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,500
So you need closure.

295
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,000
Yes, I do.

296
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
See, that is where I think Rebecca can help.

297
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Look, I know...when I first went I thought it was a load of shite,

298
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,500
but my friend made me go and I never regretted it.

299
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,000
My mum had just died and...

300
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,500
...I just needed to know she wasn’t...

301
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,250
...gone forever.

302
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,000
I mean, it took a couple of sessions, but...

303
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,500
...I got what I needed.

304
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,500
Do you think Rebecca’s the real deal?

305
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,500
If I didn’t believe in her, I wouldn’t have asked her to see you.

306
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,500
She doesn’t see just anyone.

307
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,300
She needs to...

308
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:44,000
She needs to believe in what you want.

309
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
And I guess she’s not interested in people being just curious.

310
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
So you must see her again.

311
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,500
Does she take any money?

312
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:55,000
No, she doesn’t do it for the money. She’s got a day job.

313
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,750
She does it because she can.

314
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,500
Hello, Human Resources, how can I…

315
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,500
Oh, hi!

316
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,000
Yep! Just a minute.

317
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
His master’s voice.

318
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Who?

319
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,500
Sam!

320
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,000
Hi!

321
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,250
Oh, I meant to tell you, I’ve got an exhibition

322
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,500
in Liverpool, Tuesday next week,

323
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,500
SAM: so I need to stay overnight.

324
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,300
Oh!

325
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,000
I know you can’t be on your own but I bet Joanna will stay with you.

326
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,500
Yeah, Jo’s good like that.

327
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,000
Have a girls' night.

328
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Yeah, I will.

329
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,500
Okay, see you later.

330
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,000
Yeah, love you.

331
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,500
Girls' night next Tuesday?

332
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,500
Tuesday?

333
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,300
Bollocks! I got the step-mum invading.

334
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
It’s so nice to get you out for lunch.

335
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,500
Are you okay?

336
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,200
Yeah!

337
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,000
You still taking those meds?

338
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
No, I don’t like the way they make me feel.

339
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,300
Seriously, Emma, how do you cope?

340
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:58,000
I kind of exchange one sensation for another.

341
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,100
Okay, let’s go.

342
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:02,400
So…this sensation!

343
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,150
Sex!

344
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,500
Oh! Okay! Yep!

345
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,800
That’ll do the trick.

346
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,000
It does.

347
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Well, I can think of worse things to do.

348
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,800
So, is that something you like discovered

349
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,000
in the middle of a panic attack?

350
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,500
It’s before it gets to that.

351
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,500
It’s when I feel more anxious than usual

352
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,750
but it’s something that’s always worked for me.

353
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,500
Sex, I mean!

354
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,000
So you’re a nymphomaniac.

355
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
No!

356
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Let's just say I have a pretty healthy libido.

357
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
You just like it a lot.

358
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,200
A lot!

359
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,000
Well, most days!

360
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Lucky Sam!

361
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,500
I think it’s all a bit too much for him really.

362
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,000
But I can’t think of a more powerful sensation

363
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
so it helps when I feel more anxious than usual.

364
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
An orgasm a day! Yes, please!

365
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Sshhh!

366
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,800
It’s not like that.

367
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,000
What then?

368
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,200
The cuddling.

369
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,300
It's when he strokes my head and kisses my face.

370
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,500
I find that more relaxing than just about anything.

371
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,200
And then there’s the intimacy. The closeness.

372
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,000
The feeling of his hand on my head and neck.

373
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
That makes me less anxious

374
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,700
and then usually it leads to….!

375
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,700
I can see why he doesn’t want you to get better then.

376
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,250
Sorry, insensitive!

377
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:11,500
It’s all right, I don't usually tell people this.

378
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:15,500
So, does Sam know, like, why he's getting sex every day?

379
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,000
Oh yeah, the funny thing is he’s happy just to hold me

380
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,300
and caress me. I’m the one who takes it further.

381
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,800
Okay, I think I underestimated Sam.

382
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,500
Sounds like a decent bloke.

383
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,000
He is.

384
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
He must also be really knackered!

385
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
SAM: Anything on telly?

386
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,080
No, nothing any good on.

387
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Oh, do you want another?

388
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
No! Had enough. Too easy!

389
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,500
So…!

390
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,800
What?

391
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,000
The spirit medium thing.

392
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I’m gonna give it another try.

393
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,000
Look…

394
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I think if I'm gonna get better I need closure.

395
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,900
I know, and I understand how you feel.

396
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,000
No you don’t.

397
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
You don’t know what it’s like to lose a sister,

398
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
to know that she was murdered, and you don’t know who by.

399
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,500
And you miss her so much

400
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,000
you just wanna walk in a room and see her

401
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,300
and when she’s not there

402
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:26,000
it hits you like a punch in the stomach.

403
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,100
And you know you’re life will never be the same

404
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,000
because one of the most joyful things,

405
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,500
one of the most precious things in life has been taken,

406
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,000
and I need to know how

407
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
so don’t tell me not to do everything I can.

408
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
What, now?

409
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I want to.

410
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,000
Is this what the weekend’s gonna be like?

411
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,350
Oh no!

412
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:25,500
It’s gonna be much filthier.

413
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
And how was the dirty weekend?

414
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Dirty!

415
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Details.

416
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,700
You could’t handle it.

417
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,000
Oh, I can!

418
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,500
I really can!

419
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,800
I need to know!

420
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,500
I've got to know!

421
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,500
Keeley’s not getting enough of her own.

422
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,000
i haven’t got the time. NHS would grind to a halt.

423
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,300
Supernurse.

424
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,800
Ta-da-da-daaaa!

425
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,800
Here to save the day with my big hypodermic!

426
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,700
Boasting again.

427
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,600
Thank God for nurses like you.

428
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,500
Let’s not forget about the little people…

429
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,000
...like Jo.

430
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,440
Excuse me! If it wasn’t for the little people like me,

431
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,500
the people like you would have to do all their own checkouts.

432
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,000
Oh, that would be terrible, having to scan your own shopping.

433
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,200
But I ike it when Jo does it for me instead of going to it

434
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,000
and it saying, 'Call for assistance.'

435
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,100
I mean, what’s the point if you have to have someone do it for you?

436
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,000
See!

437
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,100
Oh, do that again.

438
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
That look’s terrible.

439
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
High fever,

440
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
rapid pulse.

441
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,500
I prescribe lots of sex and another glass of wine.

442
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,000
The wine works for me.

443
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Darling, you really have to lose your cherry some time.

444
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,500
Oi, who says I haven’t?

445
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,100
Well, you never say anything about getting any….

446
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,500
...wahay!

447
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,300
'Wahay'? Who says ‘Wahay'?

448
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,200
Just being polite.

449
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,500
You’re only polite when your gob’s shut.

450
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:41,000
Keeley, tell us one of your nursie stories.

451
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,500
Oh, I love those.

452
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,000
Oh, okay!

453
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,160
Oh, do you know what a tracheotomy is?

454
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,000
No.

455
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,800
Okay, well, when someone's airway is blocked

456
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,300
you make an incision in their trachea.

457
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,300
Their what-ier?

458
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,100
Their windpipe.

459
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,500
I knew that.

460
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,500
Yeah, right!

461
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,600
I did!

462
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,300
So, you make a hole in their windpipe so that the patient can breath.

463
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,000
Now the trouble is that sometimes it can get stuck

464
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,100
with lots of mucus and gunk...

465
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,100
Ewww!

466
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,900
and that needs suctioning out.

467
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
You make good sucking noises.

468
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
She gets a lot of practise.

469
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Oi! Carry on Keeley.

470
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
So, to do this you take this long piece of tubing

471
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,400
with a suction pump at one end,

472
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,900
and at the other this piece of kit called a yankauer.

473
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,500
A what?

474
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,700
A yankauer!

475
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,900
So, I was on nightshift, and it was 3 AM in the morning.

476
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,000
It was nice and quiet and peaceful

477
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
when this man, who had just had a tracheostomy,

478
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,500
started gurgling and struggling to breathe.

479
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:43,000
So Jenny, the staff nurse, went right over to him

480
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,900
and said in a really loud voice,

481
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,000
‘Would like me to yanker you?’

482
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,700
The man’s eyes nearly popped out.

483
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,500
I bet that wasn’t the only thing.

484
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,000
I was eating a sandwich at the time

485
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,800
and laughing so much I nearly choked.

486
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,400
You needed yankering!

487
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,500
Nearly!

488
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,500
It must be weird with all those men in bed letching at you.

489
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,900
You think? Get this!

490
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,310
So, I was taking handover from day shift

491
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:21,200
from this very handsome male nurse named Dan.

492
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,300
And I’m talking hot!

493
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,000
And I mean hot!

494
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,500
He's really hot!

495
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:30,300
So, he was giving me details abut this 20-year-old female patient

496
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,600
who was laying in bed and she was gazing up adoringly.

497
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,300
And I was like, oh yeah,

498
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,500
she's having some amazing fantasies about hot Dad.

499
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,000
And then later on I go through some routine stuff with her,

500
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
and I say, 'How are you feeling?'

501
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,800
And she goes, ‘I am gagging for sex.’

502
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:51,600
And I was like, Oh, okay! Well, hey ho! I can’t help you there!

503
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,000
So I was like, 'Oh it must have been really difficult for you

504
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
having hot Dan looking after you,'

505
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,300
and she goes,

506
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:01,000
'I didn’t mean him. I’m gay. I meant you!'

507
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
And I was like, Oh my God!

508
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,160
You must have run a mile.

509
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,300
Not really. She was kind of cute.

510
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,000
Yeah, but you’re not gay.

511
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Not gay, no, but...one time....

512
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
...like Katy Perry said,

513
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
and I kinda liked it.

514
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,300
God!

515
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,500
Honestly, Jo, you’re such a weeny sometimes.

516
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,000
I tell you, with some of the things I have to deal with,

517
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
kissing a girl is no big thing.

518
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Blood! Shit!

519
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Sick! Death!

520
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,500
Can I ask you something?

521
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,200
Sure?

522
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,400
You’ve seen people die.

523
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,000
Yeah, i've been right by their side when they went.

524
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,500
What happens? Do you see anything?

525
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,400
Feel anything?

526
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:59,000
No, but, you know they’re not there any more.

527
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
One thing I do, which is a personal thing -

528
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I open a window.

529
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,900
Sort of let the spirit out.

530
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,500
So you think there is a spirit?

531
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,300
I’d like to think there is.

532
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,000
And I want to help it out on its way.

533
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
And if you didn’t open the window would the spirit remain,

534
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,100
like a ghost?

535
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:19,000
I have no idea,

536
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,400
but maybe that’s what a ghost is -

537
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,050
a spirit that hasn’t gone to where it needs to go.

538
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,000
Right! Let’s talk about what scares us the most.

539
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Okay, you first.

540
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,800
Spiders!

541
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,160
Is that all?

542
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,000
Well, what scares you then?

543
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Well, nothing really.

544
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Nothing scares you! Makes you jump!

545
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,400
Oh, well, okay, well, I don’t like people making me jump.

546
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,900
I hate it.

547
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,000
When I was a kid I freaked out

548
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
when I was in my bedroom

549
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,200
and my brother jumped into the doorway and yelled ‘BOO!’

550
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,160
I kid you not, I took off, leaping into the air

551
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,800
and landing onto the bed in tears.

552
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,000
He thought he was hilarious, of course.

553
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,300
So come on Emma, what about you?

554
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,300
Er, I dunno!

555
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,800
Well, there must be something. What about when you were a kid?

556
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,800
All kids are scared of something.

557
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Erm…!

558
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,200
My dressing gown!

559
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:15,800
What?

560
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,000
Your dressing gown?

561
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Er…I’d be lying in bed

562
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,900
and it would be hanging on the bedroom door, and...

563
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,800
...in the dark and...

564
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,800
it looked like it changed shape,

565
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,800
and I’d hide under the covers until I fell asleep.

566
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,800
You’re just a couple of wussies.

567
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,700
I need to pee.

568
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
You know where it is.

569
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
That was quick.

570
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,500
Yeah, I -

571
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,000
I just remembered...

572
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I needed...get home -

573
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,700
Yeah!

574
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,100
Sorry!

575
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,200
Will you be okay?

576
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, just - just -

577
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,000
- short walk.

578
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,200
Bye!

579
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,900
That was all a bit sudden.

580
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,000
Yeah, maybe she left the gas on or something.

581
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,500
Funny girl!

582
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,500
You sure you don’t mind staying over?

583
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,000
Of course not.

584
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Helps knowing someone’s here.

585
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,900
Cute PJs.

586
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,000
Thanks.

587
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,900
Night then.

588
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:27,900
Night!

589
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,500
Emma?

590
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,650
Sorry…erm -

591
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:05,000
Bad dreams.

592
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:06,750
Come here.

593
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,000
EMMA: I’m so sorry!

594
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:15,000
What can I do?

595
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,500
Sam strokes my head.

596
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,500
Oh, I am so sorry.

597
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,400
It’s okay.

598
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,600
I am so embarrassed.

599
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,200
It’s just -

600
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,100
JO: It’s okay, really.

601
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,000
I mean, if you want to get in, we can just -

602
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,900
No, I'm not sure either -

603
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:44,200
- if that would help.

604
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,000
Oh God! Erm -

605
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I feel so much better. I’ll just go back to my room.

606
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I’m sorry, Jo.

607
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Oh, I helped myself.

608
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,600
I’ll be off as soon as I‘ve finished. I don’t want to be late.

609
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,600
Okay.

610
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:21,000
I can get you some coffee, if you’d like.

611
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
No, thanks.

612
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,500
I’m sorry about last night.

613
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:26,500
It’s okay.

614
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:30,000
When I get a panic attack, I just…I can’t…

615
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
It’s okay. That’s what I was here for.

616
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,400
Although I’d not seen you have one before.

617
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,600
Glad you were here, thanks.

618
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,000
When Sam’s away I find it hard to -

619
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:46,000
Any time. I have to rush. Call me if you need me.

620
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Thanks Jo.

621
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,300
I can see her...but...

622
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:19,500
I can’t see her face.

623
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:22,700
All this medium stuff, it’s messing with your mind.

624
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,500
But...what if it's -

625
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,000
It’s all in your mind.

626
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,500
Then I need to find out.

627
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:41,000
I need your help.

628
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,000
Hi, come in.

629
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,400
I hope you don’t mind me bringing Leah with me.

630
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,000
I wouldn’t have found you otherwise.

631
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,900
Funny thing for a psychic to say.

632
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:02,600
Oh, I’m not a psychic, I think of myself more as a conduit.

633
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,900
Without a satnav, I keep telling her, she needs to get one.

634
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:08,900
Oh I didn’t mean it like that, I wasn’t meant to be funny.

635
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,100
It’s okay. Leah convinced me to come.

636
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,700
I’m grateful.

637
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:14,200
Just as long as you're aware,

638
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,000
I’m not like that woman from Polstergeist.

639
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,300
I don’t normally do home visits.

640
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:22,000
My gift is more about being able to let the spirits into my home.

641
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,800
But tell me what’s happened.

642
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,900
I feel a presence.

643
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,500
Okay. Can I have a look around?

644
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:29,200
Feel free.

645
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,100
Shall I make coffee or...

646
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:34,500
No, stay where you are. Let’s see what I can sense.

647
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,150
Sarah stayed in this room.

648
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:21,000
Yes sometimes.

649
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
She liked it here with you. It was fun.

650
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Is she here?

651
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,900
Yes.

652
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,200
Can I see her?

653
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:33,900
She’s been trying to show…

654
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:51,500
Sarah!

655
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
She’ll stay over like she used to,

656
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
and you’ll see her every now and then.

657
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:51,000
Sarah’s here.

658
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:58,880
Emma, you look so different.

659
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,100
I feel different.

660
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:04,300
I’ve never felt so calm, no anxiety at all.

661
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,100
It’s Sarah making you feel like that.

662
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:08,000
Can she do that?

663
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,700
Sarah’s a spirit. The spirit’s much stronger than the physical.

664
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,550
I believe the spirit possesses a purity

665
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:15,700
that we can’t even begin to imagine until

666
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:17,500
we, too, are spirits.

667
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:21,800
And all the pain and anxiety of the physical body has gone.

668
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:25,420
I think Sarah shared some of her spirit with you.

669
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:29,900
SAM - What’s going on?

670
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:32,400
Something amazing has happened.

671
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,000
Yeah?

672
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
We’ll be going.

673
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
See you in the morning, yeah?

674
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,600
Sarah’s here.

675
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:49,300
She came to visit.

676
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:50,000
Emma -

677
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,100
She made me feel completely calm,

678
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:54,600
like I have so anxiety whatsoever.

679
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:58,100
Well, if you’re going to be well again…

680
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:02,000
I know I’m going to be much, much better.

681
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,500
Well, that’s all I want.

682
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,000
Okay?

683
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Perfectly okay. Goodnight.

684
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,700
So it’s all good.

685
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:38,000
Yeah!

686
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,600
And what about -

687
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:40,000
What?

688
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,500
The sex!

689
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:42,300
Don’t feel the need.

690
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:45,000
So what happened to horny Emma?

691
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,000
I don’t know. I feel like I have something more.

692
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,800
So no more dirty weekends?

693
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,000
Who needs them?

694
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,500
I fuckin’ do.

695
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,600
EMMA: What’s this?

696
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:28,000
LEAH: The Empire. It shows films and live shows.

697
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
LEAH: Let’s go one evening.

698
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
EMMA: You and me?

699
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
LEAH: Yeah, girls' night out.

700
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
EMMA: Yeah, okay!

701
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
TESS: Richard, why are you so hesitant?

702
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
I'm not, I just -

703
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Don’t believe.

704
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I can’t believe in something I haven’t seen.

705
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
What about God? You can’t see Him.

706
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
I stopped being in God when he let our daughter die.

707
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Mum!

708
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:15,000
I’ve not seen you look so happy before.

709
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Dad!

710
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
So!

711
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Come with me.

712
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Dad?

713
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:35,000
You two go up.

714
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:51,000
Have you seen her?

715
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
No.

716
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:06,200
Sarah!

717
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,250
Mum’s here!

718
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,000
Can’t you feel her spirit here?

719
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Maybe another time.

720
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:33,450
Sarah?

721
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:40,900
I don’t think she can hear the way we understand, so...

722
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:42,900
…just love her.

723
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
I do!

724
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:07,450
Richard...

725
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:09,000
...I saw her.

726
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
You can see here too. Just go up.

727
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
What’s the point?

728
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,300
She’s not coming home.

729
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Give him time.

730
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Sarah!

731
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Sarah, can you show me you’re here?

732
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Oh, Sarah!

733
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,200
It’s beyond wonderful to see you.

734
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:25,000
You’ve changed my life.

735
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
It’s been so hard since you left me,

736
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,000
but I feel so much better knowing your spirit lives on.

737
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
But Sarah,

738
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
there’s something that’s a hard question to ask and...

739
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:41,000
...I need an answer.

740
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Can you tell me…

741
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:47,000
...can you find a way to tell me who killed you?

742
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:57,900
Wait!

743
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,500
No, come back.

744
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Yeah yeah yeah - great, I’ll send that...I’ll sort it soon as -

745
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Yeah!

746
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Right, okay, great! Bye!

747
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:45,000
Pick up, Emma.

748
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,470
Answer your fuckin’ phone.

749
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,100
Emma!

750
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:12,350
Emma!

751
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:15,000
Come on, wake up.

752
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
You all right?

753
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
What time is it?

754
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,900
Almost six.

755
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:20,000
It’s still early.

756
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,600
In the evening!

757
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,200
Morning, Sleepy!

758
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:38,100
Morning!

759
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:43,000
Come on, up you get coz I’m off to work.

760
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,500
Okay!

761
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:45,000
Yeah?

762
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:45,500
Mmm.

763
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:46,000
Okay!

764
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:09,600
I’ve brought you some tea, sir.

765
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:13,700
I have to go and see a young woman in the morning.

766
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:15,850
I want you to come with me.

767
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:18,000
Why don’t you have a regular partner, sir?

768
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,000
What do you see here?

769
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:27,000
Their throats are all burnt.

770
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,500
Conclusion?

771
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,500
Serial killer?

772
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,100
SUTTON: If it’s a serial killer

773
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:45,000
he’s been killing for over a hundred and sixty years.

774
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
What happened?

775
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
My back!

776
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Let me see!

777
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Uh…!

778
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:14,000
I always knew having a nurse for a friend would come in handy.

779
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,200
Well, it’s better dressing than what Emma did.

780
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:20,550
Well, that’s why you’re a nurse and I work in human resources!

781
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,500
We're going to see Emma West.

782
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:26,700
Her twin sister was murdered a year ago.

783
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:28,900
Her throat burned.

784
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:30,000
And other parts.

785
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,900
Take notes. Don’t speak.

786
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:37,100
KEELEY: You seem…

787
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:39,000
...different.

788
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Yeah! I’m doing great.

789
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Okay, well, I’ll see you later.

790
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Bye.

791
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
See Ya.

792
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,100
Bye.

793
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:06,300
Don’t be late for work.

794
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,100
Miss West? Do you remember me?

795
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:18,800
I know this sound weird but have you seen me...

796
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:21,600
...in a place where you wouldn’t expect to see me?

797
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:23,500
Yes.

798
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:25,900
Where?

799
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:27,100
In a dream.

800
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:29,300
In a dream!

801
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:32,000
I saw Sarah being killed…

802
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,500
...by you.

803
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,500
Do you know why you would dream that?

804
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:41,900
I thought maybe Sarah was trying to show me how she was killed,

805
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:43,500
but it was just an anxiety dream.

806
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:46,000
I’ve been much better since I saw Sarah.

807
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
In your dream?

808
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:51,000
No. She’s here. Her spirit! I see her.

809
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:55,000
I’ll come back.

810
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
You have your notes?

811
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Yes, sir.

812
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,100
Tear them up. You’ll never need them.

813
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:10,200
MILLER: Shit!

814
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:14,000
That’s why I don’t have a regular partner!

815
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,500
Emma!

816
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:54,800
Yeah?

817
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:57,000
Wasn't sure if you were asleep.

818
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Not sure of anything.

819
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Just doing my relaxation.

820
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
I thought you were relaxed enough.

821
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,800
I am. I was.

822
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:10,000
Is there something you want to tell me?

823
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,900
The other night I saw Sarah, and she kissed me

824
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:14,100
and I asked her to tell me who murdered her

825
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:15,600
and I think she will.

826
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,500
I don't know, it's like you're worse, you're different.

827
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:21,000
It's like you've got some sort of insanity.

828
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,500
I don’t know what you expect.

829
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:24,000
How about some fucking honesty?

830
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
When have I not been open and honest with you?

831
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
All those looks between you and Keeley.

832
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,500
What? What looks?

833
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:33,000
The sort of looks that tell me you two know something I don’t.

834
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,500
Well, maybe you don’t need to know.

835
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:37,000
Well, call me paranoid but if Keeley was a guy

836
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
I might be fucking jealous.

837
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,100
You know what, Sam?

838
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:43,300
Whatever I did in the past really has nothing to do with you.

839
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:44,250
Yeah, well…

840
01:07:44,250 --> 01:07:47,000
I never took you for a dyke.

841
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,900
First of all, I’m not gay.

842
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:52,500
And if I was, what the fuck has it got to do with you?

843
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:55,500
Except for the fact that I wouldn’t be fucking you in the first place.

844
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:58,400
But, yeah, Keeley and I played around when we were younger,

845
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,000
exploring how we felt. What’s the harm in that?

846
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,500
I mean you didn’t have to do, like...

847
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:04,000
...anything.

848
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,400
What we did or didn’t do has nothing to do with you.

849
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:11,400
Just like what you did in the past has nothing to do with me.

850
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:14,000
And who are to be judgemental, anyway?

851
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,600
You who used to smoke dope and peddle drugs

852
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:18,900
and rob old ladies to pay for your habit.

853
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:20,100
That’s not the same.

854
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:24,000
No! I wasn’t hurting anyone.

855
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:28,600
Look…

856
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:31,000
...you’ve done amazing to change your life around,

857
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,500
but you had something to change. I didn’t.

858
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:36,700
I’m still the same person.

859
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:38,400
It’s like I don’t know who you are.

860
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:41,000
Surely you’re not insecure.

861
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,500
You know what? I can’t be dealing within this.

862
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:44,300
I’m going to bed…in the spare room.

863
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:45,200
That’s Sarah’s room.

864
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:48,000
Yeah, well Sarah can move out, or I will.

865
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
I’ve brought someone.

866
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:16,300
Emma?

867
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Could I have a drink?

868
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,500
Erm…tea?

869
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:23,700
Do you have any brandy? Scotch?

870
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:25,400
We have water.

871
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:26,450
Is it bottled?

872
01:11:26,450 --> 01:11:27,000
No.

873
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,500
Well, thank you but no. I never drink water from the tap.

874
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:32,300
Neither would you you if you knew what went into it.

875
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:35,000
Excuse me, but who exactly are you?

876
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,200
My name’s Susan Brooke.

877
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:38,600
I’m a parapsychologist.

878
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,500
What’s this about?

879
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:43,000
Emma, this morning you told me you saw me,

880
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,100
or what looked like me, killing your sister.

881
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:47,000
This morning?

882
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,500
He came by the house.

883
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:51,000
What? You never said.

884
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Argue later.

885
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:56,200
Emma, have you sought out your sister’s spirit in any way?

886
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:58,300
I went to see a medium.

887
01:11:58,300 --> 01:12:03,000
And then you started seeing your sister here in your home.

888
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,500
What you’ve been seeing is not your sister.

889
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:10,000
I believe that there are dark forces

890
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,800
that can appear in many different forms.

891
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:16,900
Sometimes we see them as those who’ve died.

892
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:17,700
Ghosts!

893
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:18,900
But why?

894
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:20,900
To delude us. To cheat us.

895
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:24,800
To make us think that what is evil is really good.

896
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,000
I don’t accept that.

897
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,500
What I’m telling you now you must accept.

898
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:30,900
Why must I?

899
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:34,400
Because there is a dark force intent on destroying you.

900
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:36,050
What is this dark force?

901
01:12:36,050 --> 01:12:39,500
It lurks in a kind of spiritual darkness.

902
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:43,000
It can’t exist in our world without a vessel,

903
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,900
so it attaches itself to someone.

904
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:48,000
It can infiltrate our thoughts…

905
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:50,450
our dreams…

906
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,000
but most importantly,

907
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,500
it can imitate the dead...

908
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,000
And the living.

909
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,700
It will take on a physical form

910
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:10,000
so that it can achieve its darkest desire

911
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,000
and will bring itself to a sense of depraved fulfilment

912
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:20,000
that it just can’t achieve in its own dark spirit world.

913
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,800
And this attacked Emma tonight?

914
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:22,840
It attacked you?

915
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,600
I thought it was Sam.

916
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,000
It made my neck sore.

917
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,540
Emma, you remember that your sister

918
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:44,000
was found with severe burning around her throat?

919
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,900
What we never made public was that

920
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:48,500
she was the fourth girl found dead with these burns.

921
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,500
SUSAN: It generates heats that intensifies

922
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:56,000
SUSAN: and it leaves its victims with terrible burns.

923
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,000
But leaves no forensic evidence. No DNA. No fluids.

924
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,500
The only thing I know for sure is that Cain appears as me.

925
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:04,900
Cain?

926
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:06,600
That’s the name I chose for it.

927
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,000
Why Cain?

928
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,400
Because Cain was the first murderer.

929
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,000
In the Bible.

930
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,900
It’s the name that came to mind when I saw it

931
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:15,600
standing over Sarah’s body,

932
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,800
and I knew what it was.

933
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
But why does it look like you, and how can we tell which is which?

934
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,700
I don’t know how to answer that except that I knew it,

935
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:26,500
and it knew me.

936
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:30,000
Like twins.

937
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:34,400
What’s important here, Emma, is that it found you during a seance.

938
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:35,900
And I brought it home.

939
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:37,500
And it won’t leave until -

940
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:38,500
I’m dead.

941
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:42,000
Which is why we’re getting out of here now.

942
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Wherever you go, it will go with you.

943
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,350
You have to defeat it here.

944
01:14:46,350 --> 01:14:48,000
How do we do that?

945
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,800
I think perhaps when it realises you know what it is

946
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:53,800
it might just leave you.

947
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,600
You think it might?

948
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:57,600
I know, it’s not an exact science,

949
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,600
but I do have one suggestion

950
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:03,400
that might help you defend yourself against it. Salt!

951
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:04,100
Salt?

952
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:09,000
I’ve read in some old texts that it’s a kind of barrier against evil,

953
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,700
perhaps because it has some come kind of pure quality to it.

954
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:14,300
You read in old texts?

955
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:17,100
You don’t have a shred of evidence for any of this, do you?

956
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:21,700
In the Bible it says, 'You are the salt of the earth.'

957
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:24,600
Even in the Bible there are indications.

958
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:28,500
'Regard them not that are familiar spirits.'

959
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:32,700
And what about you? You who can see this evil.

960
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:35,200
Perhaps by some kind of providence,

961
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:38,400
there are those among us who are here to help us...

962
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:41,200
...to warn us.

963
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:43,000
An angel?

964
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:48,000
I prefer to think that he’s someone with a special gift.

965
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,450
Or curse!

966
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:01,000
In my job you tend to prefer something stronger than tea.

967
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:09,800
Do you believe any of that?

968
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:11,800
Yeah!

969
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Wait here.

970
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,500
We might need some more. I’m going to go and get some.

971
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:22,300
Don’t leave me here.

972
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:25,450
You’re right. Come with me.

973
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:13,000
He’s messing with our minds.

974
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,900
SAM: Where is this?

975
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:32,600
I mean, there’s no walls, there’s no roof.

976
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:34,550
We’re standing on something.

977
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:37,900
Emma!

978
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:40,400
Emma, Help me!

979
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,500
Help me!

980
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:58,250
Please! Emma!

981
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Give it to me.

982
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:18,550
Hope that mad woman knows what she’s talking about.

983
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,500
I know who you are!

984
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
TESS: What on earth’s going on?

985
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Mum!

986
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
We have to get inside the circle.

987
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Circle?

988
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:40,000
Ow! Mum! Mum!

989
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,600
You’re hurting me.

990
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
What the fuck did you do that for?

991
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,900
It’s Keeley!

992
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:09,900
Come on.

993
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,940
We’ve got to stay inside the circle.

994
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:16,100
Yeah, it doesn’t like salt.

995
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:17,300
What doesn’t?

996
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:19,000
The demon…thing!

997
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,930
It killed Sarah.

998
01:20:20,930 --> 01:20:23,000
And now it wants Emma.

999
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,800
Well, it’s not getting you.

1000
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:25,840
What?

1001
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:30,000
Keeley!

1002
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:34,200
Love you, Emma.

1003
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:16,000
It’s not real.

1004
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:17,700
It’s an illusion.

1005
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:19,100
I know you and you know me.

1006
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,000
I was on fire.

1007
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,300
And the room, it...it...wasn’t here.

1008
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:27,000
An hallucination. Cain’s tricks.

1009
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Let’s get you all to a hospital.

1010
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,300
What just happened? Why’d you come back?

1011
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:55,350
Because I suddenly knew that Cain wanted to take you

1012
01:23:55,350 --> 01:23:57,000
to whatever hell he came from.

1013
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,100
So what does that make you?

1014
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:02,000
That’s a question that’s been worrying me.

1015
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,200
You loved the countryside so much

1016
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:08,800
and I know it’s where I can be with you Sarah, but…

1017
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:12,580
it’s taken these past two years for me to be able to do this.

1018
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:16,000
Mum still visits your grave.

1019
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:19,900
Sam is doing well.

1020
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:24,700
His scars are fading faster than his surgeon expected.

1021
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:28,500
All of our scars are fading

1022
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,900
and we’ve put what happened behind us

1023
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:34,800
because there’s no other direction to go but forward.

1024
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:41,150
I've changed my way of thinking and...

1025
01:25:41,150 --> 01:25:43,600
...I meditate.

1026
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:45,700
And though it’s not been easy,

1027
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:48,000
you’ve always said that I was stronger than most people you knew

1028
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
because I had to be,

1029
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,300
and which is why…

1030
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:56,600
I’ve finally been able to come out here on my own, ta daaaaa!

1031
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:01,000
But now I believe in angels.

1032
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,100
But not the way mum does.

1033
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,000
You’re my angel, Sarah,

1034
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:15,200
and whatever Inspector Sutton is or how he knew what he knew,

1035
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:18,000
it really was you, I do believe.

1036
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,000
And I’ve come to understand that poem that you loved so much

1037
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:24,500
and which I knew you wanted to be read at your funeral but....

1038
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:26,500
...you know her!

1039
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:30,900
Which is why I’m going to say it for you today.

1040
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,600
Not because you’re gone.

1041
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:37,300
Because you’re here.

1042
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:43,800
Do not stand at my grave and weep.

1043
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:45,300
I'm not there.

1044
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:48,500
I did not sleep.

1045
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:52,000
I’m a thousand winds that blow.

1046
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:56,000
I’m diamond glints on snow.

1047
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,000
I am the sunlight on rippened grain.

1048
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:03,000
I’m the gentle autumn rain.

1049
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,000
When you awaken in the morning's hush

1050
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,500
I'm the swift uplifting rush

1051
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:12,000
Of quiet birds in circled flight.

1052
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:16,000
I am the soft silent stars that shine at night.

1053
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Do not stand at my grave and cry.

1054
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,600
I’m not there.

1055
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:23,900
I did not die.
