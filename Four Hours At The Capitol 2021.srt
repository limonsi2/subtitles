Officer Michael Fanone:
<i>January 6th started off</i>

10
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:35,541
<i>pretty much like</i>
<i>any other day for me.</i>

11
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:37,666
<i>Got up, got a workout in.</i>

12
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,916
Rep. Madison Cawthorn
(on radio):<i> Go and fight</i>
<i>in Washington D.C.!</i>

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,416
<i>I'll tell you,</i>
<i>and at 12:00 today,</i>

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,125
<i>we will be contesting</i>
<i>the election!</i>

15
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:48,958
Fanone:
<i>But it, it wasn't until</i>
<i>I started listening to</i>

16
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:51,833
<i>the speeches that</i>
<i>were given at that rally</i>

17
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:52,958
<i>on the 6th,</i>

18
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:54,500
<i>that I felt that, uh,</i>

19
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:56,958
<i>that day was gonna</i>
<i>be a bad day.</i>

20
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:59,666
Donald Trump Jr. (on radio):
<i>These guys better</i>
<i>fight for Trump</i>

21
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,000
<i>because if they're not,</i>
<i>guess what?</i>

22
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:04,541
Rudy Giuliani (on radio):
<i>Let's have trial by combat!</i>

23
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:06,041
Fanone:
<i>And I could tell,</i>

24
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:08,125
that today might be a problem.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,416
<i>I've been a police officer now</i>
<i>for almost two decades,</i>

26
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,791
<i>and that day,</i>

27
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:18,416
<i>to think that I,</i>

28
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,916
<i>and a shit ton</i>
<i>of my fellow officers</i>

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,916
<i>almost lost their lives,</i>

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,375
pisses me the fuck off.

00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,416
(indistinct chatter)

33
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,208
Oh, thank you, sir.
Thank you very much.

34
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:47,750
Hold on, let me
turn it around, Drew.

35
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:51,750
All right, let's hope my WiFi
stays up this time, guys.

36
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:56,875
<i>I got up very early</i>
<i>on the 6th.</i>

37
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:59,083
<i>I was trying to get in</i>
<i>where President Trump was,</i>

38
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,541
<i>uh, but the line was, probably,</i>

39
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:04,666
<i>50,000 people in line</i>
<i>trying to get in.</i>

40
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,250
Oh, they're not lettin'
anybody in anymore.

41
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:07,416
It's full packed already.

42
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,208
<i>And I saw some</i>
<i>friends of mine, and...</i>

43
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:12,083
they said, "Hey, uh, let's go to
the Washington Monument."

44
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:13,541
So I went to
the Washington Monument,

45
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:14,541
and that's where I saw

46
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:15,708
a lot of people that I noticed,

47
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:17,458
and knew who they were.

48
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,375

Proud Boys (chanting):
Fuck Antifa...

50
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:27,875
Eddie Block:
<i>Everybody knows me</i>
<i>as a Proud Boy,</i>

51
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:29,833
<i>but that's 'cause</i>
<i>I'm the crippled guy</i>
<i>on the scooter</i>

52
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,750
<i>who films everything.</i>

53
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:36,333
(Proud Boy shouting)

54
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:43,458
Uh, you have to be a man
to be a Proud Boy, number one.

55
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:48,125
<i>We're a group of, uh,</i>
<i>men that believe in God,</i>

56
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,416
<i>and we believe</i>
<i>the American way of life</i>

57
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,916
<i>is the best way of life.</i>

58
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,833
<i>We're like brothers.</i>

59
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:58,000
<i>We vet people.</i>
<i>We wanna make sure we get</i>
<i>the best of the best.</i>

60
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,958
And I'm not talkin'
about physical-wise
'cause, I mean, look at me.

61
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:04,625
We're talkin' about just people
with the values that we have.

62
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,500
You know,
you don't beat up women,

63
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:10,083
you, you don't go against,
you know, the United States,

64
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,000
stuff like that.

65
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:16,375
<i>Everybody just started</i>
<i>marching down the grass</i>

66
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,375
<i>towards the Capitol.</i>

67
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:19,541
Let's go!

68
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,333
(indistinct chatter)

69
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,041

I'm goin' live. Mask up!

70
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,125
Share this video, guys.

71
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,541
You're walkin'
with the Proud Boys

72
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,291
to the State Capitol.

73
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,166
<i>They felt that</i>
<i>the election was stolen.</i>

74
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,958
They felt that their vote
was taken away from 'em,

75
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:40,916
and they felt this
was the only way to get
their voices heard.

76
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,958
Crazy cripple comin' through!

77
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:46,375
It, it looks like soldiers
'cause we are soldiers.

78
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,625
-Ready? Let's roll!
-We're good.

79
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,583
-Block: Whose streets?
-Crowd: Our streets!

80
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,125
-Whose streets?
-Our streets!

81
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:57,208
Rep. Buddy Carter:
<i>You know, I, I wouldn't</i>
<i>say it was a normal day.</i>

82
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:58,583
We knew that it-- Of course,

83
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,458
we would be voting on

84
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:03,500
election certification.

85
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:06,166
<i>You know, they were moving</i>
<i>toward the Capitol.</i>

86
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,416
<i>You know, this is America,</i>

87
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,916
<i>and they have</i>
<i>every right to do that.</i>

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,166
To rally and, and to protest.

89
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,333
Block:
Share this video, guys.

90
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:14,541
You're rollin'
with the Proud Boys.

91
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,416
Nobody else is live,
but Eddie Block

92
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,500
with the Proud Boys.

93
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,000
Protester (shouts):
Do your job!

94
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:25,000
Rep. Jim McGovern:
<i>That morning, I, I showed up</i>
<i>to work pretty early.</i>

95
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,666
I could hear people chanting.

96
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,791
I opened the... door,

97
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:31,333
went out to the balcony,
and I could see them,

98
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,916
uh, from a distance.

99
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,291
It just never occurred to me

100
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:39,083
that a mob would get
into the Capitol Building.

101
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:42,583
Block:
They can smell the testosterone
comin' towards 'em.

102
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,333
Leah Han:
<i>I am a staff assistant</i>

103
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:47,458
<i>with the Speaker of the House,</i>
<i>Nancy Pelosi.</i>

104
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:48,666
<i>I just came very early.</i>

105
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,791
I'm the one who usually
opens up the office,

106
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:54,875
so it didn't seem
too different that day.

107
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,458
Ethan Nordean:
We're goin' this way.
You can adjust accordingly.

108
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,000
We're turning-- turning right.

109
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:02,375
(dramatic music plays)

110
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:09,500

Tayler Hansen:
<i>You know, right as I got there,</i>

112
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,125
<i>the energy was just</i>
<i>through the roof.</i>

113
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:20,333
It was seriously something
I have never seen before.

114
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,375
I have never seen
that many people

115
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:23,541
in one area

116
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:26,000
for the support
of one president, or one thing.

117
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,333
I mean, it was amazing.

118
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,000
President Donald Trump:
<i>We will never give up.</i>

119
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,833
<i>We will never concede.</i>
<i>It doesn't happen.</i>

120
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:35,125
<i>-You don't concede</i>
<i>when there's theft involved.</i>
-(cheering)

121
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:39,583
<i>Now it is up</i>
<i>to Congress to confront</i>

122
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:43,291
<i>this egregious assault</i>
<i>on our democracy.</i>

123
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:44,708
<i>And after this,</i>

124
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,708
<i>we're gonna walk down,</i>
<i>and I'll be there with you,</i>

125
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,750
<i>to the Capitol.</i>

126
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,583
(cheering)

127
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,208
Hansen:
<i>He told all of us</i>
<i>to be out there,</i>

128
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,375
<i>and everyone</i>
<i>was just listening,</i>

129
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:56,833
<i>and we all know</i>
<i>with Trump supporters,</i>

130
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,708
<i>I mean, they admire this man.</i>

131
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,125
This man is--

132
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,583
It's-- He's their, he's their
savior, essentially.

133
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:05,208
Other than, you know,
our Lord Jesus Christ.

134
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:09,291
President Trump:
<i>Because you'll never take back</i>
<i>our country with weakness.</i>

135
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:12,500
<i>You have to show strength,</i>
<i>and you have to be strong.</i>

136
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,916
(cheering

137
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,958
<i>And we fight.</i>
<i>We fight like hell.</i>

138
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:19,666
<i>And if you don't</i>
<i>fight like hell,</i>

139
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,291
<i>you're not gonna have</i>

Ashley Gilbertson:
<i>I turn up at this rally.</i>

141
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,333
<i>You know,</i>
<i>when Trump was speaking,</i>

142
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,958
<i>it was blind devotion.</i>

143
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,708
Crowd (chanting):
Trump! Trump! Trump!

144
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,625
Gilbertson:<i> When you</i>
<i>have the President</i>
<i>of the United States,</i>

<i>that your democracy</i>

148

You must go to the Capitol

Hansen:
<i>I saw that first</i>

153
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,583
<i>They were Proud Boys.</i>

Proud Boy:
Fuck Antifa!

155
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,250
Hansen:
<i>I started going with them</i>

156
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:04,333
when Trump's speech hadn't even
gotten near, uh, the end yet.

157
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:08,375
President Trump:
<i>To use a favorite term</i>

00:33:08,541 --> 00:33:10,500
I just had all these
thoughts in my mind like,

672
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:12,833
you know, "How many
people are in here?

673
00:33:12,916 --> 00:33:15,083
"What are we gonna do
if they come in here?

674
00:33:15,166 --> 00:33:17,500
"Um, could there be

675
00:33:17,583 --> 00:33:20,083
a shootout on
the United States Senate floor?"

676
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:22,458
(yelling)

677
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:32,166
Officer Keith Robishaw:
<i>Officer Goodman kind of</i>
<i>rounded the corner</i>

678
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,333
<i>near the Senate Chambers,</i>

679
00:33:34,416 --> 00:33:36,250
<i>and he ran towards us.</i>

680
00:33:36,333 --> 00:33:39,708
(yelling)

681
00:33:39,791 --> 00:33:41,458
We all looked at each other,
and we were like, "Okay."

682
00:33:41,541 --> 00:33:43,375
And I think we all took
that brief moment, like,

683
00:33:43,458 --> 00:33:46,208
this is the final...
line in the sand,

684
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:48,208
like, "They will go no further."

685
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:51,333
You work for us.

686
00:33:54,458 --> 00:33:56,250
Robishaw:
<i>Tensions are high,</i>

687
00:33:56,333 --> 00:33:58,500
<i>they just had</i>
<i>to fight their way in.</i>

688
00:33:58,583 --> 00:34:01,166
<i>They've showed their</i>
<i>intent for violence.</i>

689
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:04,375
(yelling)

690
00:34:06,166 --> 00:34:07,666
<i>You know, they're</i>
<i>screaming things like,</i>

691
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,250
<i>"We're comin' for you, Pence!"</i>

692
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:12,750
You know,
"You can't hide from us.
We're gonna find you."

693
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:18,625
(yelling)

694
00:34:21,916 --> 00:34:24,208
<i>If I said I wasn't scared,</i>
<i>I'd be lyin'.</i>

695
00:34:24,291 --> 00:34:26,291
I was terrified.
I didn't know what to do.

696
00:34:26,375 --> 00:34:29,125
Justice is comin', baby!

697
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:31,500
Freedom!

698
00:34:31,583 --> 00:34:34,083
Robishaw:
<i>Obviously, there's the guy</i>
<i>with the, the Shaman attire,</i>

699
00:34:34,166 --> 00:34:36,250
<i>and the horns,</i>
<i>and he had the spear</i>

700
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:38,083
<i>with the American flag on it.</i>

701
00:34:38,166 --> 00:34:39,500
I don't know what
level spear it is.

702
00:34:39,583 --> 00:34:40,625
I don't know
anything about spears.

703
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:42,000
A spear's a spear to me,
you know?

704
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:44,916
It's got a sharp, pointy
end on it, it's a spear.

705
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,375
(indistinct chatter)

706
00:34:49,791 --> 00:34:51,166
Sen. Dick Durbin:
<i>It was about 2:15.</i>

707
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,666
<i>We were in the Senate Chamber.</i>

708

Security:
Mr. President...

709
00:34:53,708 --> 00:34:55,791
Two men I'd never seen before

710
00:34:55,875 --> 00:34:58,625
came onto the Senate floor,
which is unusual,

711
00:34:58,708 --> 00:35:00,750
went up to Pence,
said something to him,

712
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:03,125
and literally yanked him
out of his chair,

713
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:05,166
and pulled him out
and out the door.

714
00:35:07,916 --> 00:35:09,583
<i>Capitol Hill policeman came up,</i>

715
00:35:09,666 --> 00:35:11,125
<i>and stood before us,</i>
<i>and said,</i>

00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:13,833
<i>"Every Senator,</i>

717
00:35:13,916 --> 00:35:16,791
"And we wanna tell ya

718
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:18,458
We have this room protected."

719
00:35:18,541 --> 00:35:21,666
Not minutes later,
the same policeman
stood up and said,

720
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:25,083
"Everything's changed.
Evacuate as fast as possible."

721
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:29,708
Sen. Charles Schumer:
<i>All of a sudden,</i>

722
00:35:29,791 --> 00:35:31,250
a police officer in
a bulletproof vest

723
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:33,666
with a big machine gun
strapped across his waist

724
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,333
grabs me
by the collar like this.

725
00:35:35,416 --> 00:35:36,958
I'll never forget that feel.

726
00:35:37,041 --> 00:35:39,375
And he says,
"Senator, we're in danger."

727
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,375
<i>We walk out the door.</i>

728
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:50,166
<i>I was within 20 feet</i>
<i>of these insurrectionists.</i>

729
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:54,750
<i>These people were ransacking</i>
<i>parts of the Capitol.</i>

730
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:56,500
They took us
to this secret place.

731
00:35:56,583 --> 00:35:58,500
I'm not supposed
to say what it is.

732
00:36:04,916 --> 00:36:07,166
<i>Speaker Pelosi was there.</i>

733
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:10,958
<i>We made frantic efforts to</i>

734
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:14,666
get more military there,
National Guard,
and others to come

735
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:17,583
because there, clearly,
were not enough protection.

736
00:36:17,666 --> 00:36:20,416
We were tryin' to get
the Secretary of Defense,

737
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,458
the acting Attorney General
to get Trump to make a statement

738
00:36:23,541 --> 00:36:25,458
to ask them to leave.

739
00:36:25,541 --> 00:36:29,208
Uh, they didn't really
follow through on that,
unfortunately.

740
00:36:29,291 --> 00:36:32,541
(indistinct shouting, chatter)

741
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:36,375
Robishaw:
<i>We were standing on that line,</i>
<i>and there was the six of us.</i>

742
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:38,041
<i>Meeting violence with violence</i>
<i>at this time</i>

743
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:40,041
<i>would not be safe</i>
<i>for me and my fellow officers.</i>

744
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:42,041
The sheer number
of them compared to us,

745
00:36:42,125 --> 00:36:46,000
I knew in my head there
was no way that we could
all get physical with them,

746
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:49,083
so I took it upon myself
to try and talk to them.

747
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:52,625
No attacking, no assault,
remain calm.

748
00:36:52,708 --> 00:36:55,125
"You're not here to hurt us,
we're not here to hurt you.

749
00:36:55,208 --> 00:36:57,583
We just want everything
to simmer down."

It was really tense,

<i>that are being held captive</i>
<i>and tortured and killed.</i>

798
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:20,791
That's usually what gets people
into the door supporting Trump,

799
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:25,208
is because we can all relate
to having love for children.

800
00:39:25,291 --> 00:39:27,833
And if children are being
kidnapped and tortured

801
00:39:27,916 --> 00:39:30,333
and enslaved, sexually...

802
00:39:31,166 --> 00:39:32,250
it's wrong.

803
00:39:32,333 --> 00:39:35,125

he's absolutely

804
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:36,791
