3
00:02:47,081 --> 00:02:49,641
- Good morning, Dr Lüders.
- Good morning.

4
00:02:49,881 --> 00:02:52,001
May we do a quick
interview with you?

5
00:02:52,241 --> 00:02:54,921
Okay, but just a minute
and not a second longer!

6
00:02:55,161 --> 00:02:59,001
Then I have to leave
this wonderful place, I'm afraid.

7
00:02:59,201 --> 00:03:01,961
- I don't want to end up under a car either.
- No!

8
00:03:02,161 --> 00:03:05,561
- All the best on your 80th birthday.
- Thank you.

9
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:09,081
And congratulations
on your honorary doctorate.

10
00:03:09,361 --> 00:03:12,521
We'd like to ask
you a few questions.

11
00:03:12,761 --> 00:03:15,081
How close are we to achieving

12
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,601
your greatest goal:
equal rights for women?

13
00:03:18,841 --> 00:03:21,321
We've come some way,
but we're not there yet.

14
00:03:21,561 --> 00:03:25,521
If we don't continue to fight, we'll
lose what we've achieved so far.

15
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:30,121
- May I ask you another question?
- Okay.

16
00:03:30,321 --> 00:03:34,721
You're known in the Bundestag for
your excellent mediating skills.

17
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:37,561
How do you view
the role of women as mediators

18
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,961
in the business of politics today?

19
00:03:40,201 --> 00:03:45,121
Politics today would not be possible
without the mediating influence of women

20
00:03:45,321 --> 00:03:48,241
because men
have a strong tendency to quarrel

21
00:03:48,481 --> 00:03:52,121
and women have an equally
strong tendency to reconcile.

22
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:53,921
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

23
00:03:57,721 --> 00:04:05,801
FEMOCRACY

24
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:16,401
DEAR GENTLEMEN

25
00:05:16,641 --> 00:05:22,561
Power is viewed as something
unfeminine. I've never understood that.

26
00:05:22,801 --> 00:05:27,801
I can remember the first
major event I was involved in,

27
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:31,521
with Susanne von Paczensky,
and Eva Rühmkorf in Berlin.

28
00:05:31,761 --> 00:05:33,881
Big posters everywhere.
I was so proud.

29
00:05:34,161 --> 00:05:38,281
And the posters said: "Women and power?"
So with a question mark at the end.

30
00:05:38,521 --> 00:05:40,641
I was the only person on the panel

31
00:05:40,881 --> 00:05:43,801
who said I didn't see
the point of the question mark.

32
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:49,201
That I want to have power, that
power is not something bad per se.

33
00:05:49,481 --> 00:05:53,361
Rather, the way that people
wield this power can be bad

34
00:05:53,601 --> 00:05:55,681
and this should be questioned.

35
00:05:55,921 --> 00:05:59,281
But if I'm powerless,
I'm not able to influence anything.

36
00:05:59,561 --> 00:06:03,601
And precisely because I'm a woman, I
don't want to be without influence.

37
00:06:03,841 --> 00:06:06,121
I want power
so that I can have a say

38
00:06:06,401 --> 00:06:09,001
and fight for things
that matter to me.

39
00:07:11,001 --> 00:07:14,641
My German teacher always told me
in no uncertain terms:

40
00:07:14,881 --> 00:07:17,841
"Ursula, politics
is not a feminine pursuit."

41
00:07:18,081 --> 00:07:21,441
And the more she said that to me,

42
00:07:21,721 --> 00:07:24,481
the more I exasperated her,
of course.

43
00:07:25,081 --> 00:07:29,041
She motivated me to get
more and more involved in politics.

44
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:32,241
When I got my school
leaving certificate, she said,

45
00:07:32,481 --> 00:07:35,081
"We wish you all
the best for the future,

46
00:07:35,281 --> 00:07:38,601
that you become another
Hamm-Brücher, but with our values."

47
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:41,161
Hamm-Brücher was
a Bavarian politician

48
00:07:41,441 --> 00:07:45,281
with a combative approach, who
did a lot for educational policy,

49
00:07:45,521 --> 00:07:49,241
but her combative way
was not the convent school's style.

50
00:07:49,841 --> 00:07:52,481
So I was allowed
to follow in her footsteps,

51
00:07:52,801 --> 00:07:55,641
as long as I stuck to their values.

52
00:07:55,881 --> 00:07:59,041
<i>Since entering
Bavarian State Parliament in 1950,</i>

53
00:07:59,281 --> 00:08:02,761
<i>Hildegard Hamm-Brücher has fought
to improve educational policy.</i>

54
00:08:02,961 --> 00:08:06,321
<i>Her independent spirit,
moral courage and expertise</i>

55
00:08:06,601 --> 00:08:10,721
<i>have made her one of the best-known
cultural policymakers in Germany.</i>

56
00:08:12,321 --> 00:08:15,441
<i>And what is currently
her most pressing political goal?</i>

57
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:21,081
Improvements to the external and internal
conditions in schools for our children

58
00:08:21,321 --> 00:08:23,481
are urgently required,

59
00:08:23,721 --> 00:08:28,601
but have unfortunately been
neglected all too often in the past.

60
00:08:29,321 --> 00:08:33,521
My mother really
urged me to study hard.

61
00:08:33,761 --> 00:08:36,681
She hadn't got
her school leaving certificate,

62
00:08:36,921 --> 00:08:39,401
so she said,
"Make sure you study, my girl!

63
00:08:39,641 --> 00:08:42,641
No one can take
that knowledge away from you."

64
00:08:42,881 --> 00:08:46,441
My father was more conservative
in these matters

65
00:08:46,681 --> 00:08:51,041
and said, "Don't learn too much, my
girl. You'll never find a husband!"

66
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,241
<i>A woman faces
two questions in life:</i>

67
00:08:53,481 --> 00:08:56,841
<i>What should I wear?
And what should I cook?</i>

68
00:08:57,081 --> 00:08:58,801
That was the image of the woman.

69
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:03,441
The man is the provider, the
woman is the housewife and mother

70
00:09:03,721 --> 00:09:08,601
and once he's reached a certain
position, she makes it possible for him

71
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:11,161
to invite guests to the house,

72
00:09:11,441 --> 00:09:14,841
to entertain and
lead a social life.

73
00:09:15,081 --> 00:09:20,681
And she can use her own education
to nurture and develop the children.

74
00:09:20,921 --> 00:09:23,321
I remember a girl in my class…

75
00:09:24,201 --> 00:09:26,321
We were at a grammar school,

76
00:09:26,561 --> 00:09:29,601
and she said she
wanted to study maths.

77
00:09:30,561 --> 00:09:33,601
We were her classmates
and even we fell off our chairs

78
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:37,201
because we just couldn't imagine
a girl studying maths.

79
00:09:37,481 --> 00:09:40,681
Whenever a woman or a girl
marched to a different tune,

80
00:09:40,921 --> 00:09:44,281
it was made clear to her that
she was breaking with convention.

81
00:09:44,561 --> 00:09:48,521
"Ah, she will get married"
followed me everywhere I went.

82
00:09:48,761 --> 00:09:52,241
Up to and including
the time I went to university.

83
00:09:52,481 --> 00:09:58,281
When I started studying law in Berlin,
less than 10% of the students were women.

84
00:09:58,521 --> 00:10:04,641
Or in lectures in Hamburg
when the famous Professor Raape

85
00:10:05,401 --> 00:10:09,201
addressed the lecture hall
with "dear gentlemen…"

86
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:14,241
in spite of the fact that I and
the few other girls in the hall

87
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:18,761
had purposely sat in the front row,
he continued to use "gentlemen".

88
00:10:21,161 --> 00:10:27,361
MRS MINISTER

89
00:10:29,801 --> 00:10:32,881
<i>"… I still have the right
to speak here!"</i>

90
00:10:35,281 --> 00:10:40,001
<i>"You have entrusted me with the
task of leading the German Reich."</i>

91
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:45,841
<i>"The reunification of our free
fatherland, this is our ultimate goal."</i>

92
00:10:47,361 --> 00:10:51,161
<i>"We want to take a chance
on more democracy."</i>

93
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:56,441
<i>"There will be no experiments
in the area of foreign policy!"</i>

94
00:11:01,401 --> 00:11:04,361
<i>"No experiments
because they would lead</i>

95
00:11:04,601 --> 00:11:07,361
<i>to the downfall
of the German people once again."</i>

96
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:16,441
I was at the Konrad Adenauer Foundation
yesterday, looking at the photos:

97
00:11:16,721 --> 00:11:18,721
nothing but black suits.

98
00:11:18,961 --> 00:11:23,681
Photos of the leading committees
and ministers back then.

99
00:11:23,921 --> 00:11:26,801
Black suits
and not a woman to be seen.

100
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:31,921
At some point I said,
"You can't have half a democracy.

101
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:36,881
A nation is made up
of both men and women."

102
00:11:37,161 --> 00:11:39,121
In general, I believe that women

103
00:11:39,361 --> 00:11:42,761
have something to offer
in all areas, including politics.

104
00:11:43,001 --> 00:11:47,281
There's even a chance that a woman
could become a federal minister.

105
00:11:47,561 --> 00:11:50,481
I bet it'd liven up
cabinet meetings, Minister.

106
00:11:50,721 --> 00:11:52,841
But not just as décor, I hope!

107
00:11:53,081 --> 00:11:54,721
I'd like to believe

108
00:11:54,961 --> 00:11:58,321
there's many a capable woman
in this grand country of ours

109
00:11:58,601 --> 00:12:01,241
with the expertise required
to add something

110
00:12:01,481 --> 00:12:05,241
to the men's complex discussions
on order and the country's future.

111
00:12:05,481 --> 00:12:09,761
Yes, I was very serious just now: women
can contribute to cabinet meetings

112
00:12:10,001 --> 00:12:12,761
in a way that men can't,
don't you think, Minister?

113
00:12:13,001 --> 00:12:17,161
I do believe that women can help us
with our work, also in the cabinet.

114
00:12:17,441 --> 00:12:20,601
That was my first
really significant experience

115
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:23,001
as a member of the Bundestag.

116
00:12:23,241 --> 00:12:28,481
The female CDU MPs
were summoned by Mrs Brauksiepe.

117
00:12:29,921 --> 00:12:33,001
We decided to ask
for a woman on every committee.

118
00:12:33,241 --> 00:12:36,321
And Adenauer hadn't appointed
a single woman to the cabinet.

119
00:12:36,721 --> 00:12:42,481
Then four female MPs went to see Adenauer.
Mrs Brauksiepe in an elegant little hat.

120
00:12:49,961 --> 00:12:56,641
WOMEN AND THE CONFLICTING
PRIORITIES OF TODAY'S SOCIETY

121
00:13:15,001 --> 00:13:20,081
"Have the demeanour of a lady
and fight like a warhorse."

122
00:13:20,361 --> 00:13:23,561
Aenne Brauksiepe, CDU

123
00:13:23,801 --> 00:13:27,961
And then they came back and said,
"We've done it!"

124
00:13:28,561 --> 00:13:33,321
And we enthusiastically backed
Dr Schwarzhaupt.

125
00:13:33,561 --> 00:13:35,321
She was fantastic.

126
00:13:35,561 --> 00:13:40,321
She became Minister of Health,
but that wasn't all she did.

127
00:13:40,561 --> 00:13:42,921
As a very young woman,

128
00:13:43,161 --> 00:13:47,001
she was also in Stresemann's
German People's Party

129
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,241
in a leading administrative role.

130
00:13:49,481 --> 00:13:52,841
Then she was very active
in the Confessing Church

131
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:56,601
and then after the war she was
active in the rebuilding efforts.

132
00:13:57,081 --> 00:13:59,561
Dr Schwarzhaupt
did a really good job

133
00:13:59,801 --> 00:14:03,201
and introduced a lot of new things.

134
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:09,241
Such as food labelling and other
things that hadn't existed before.

135
00:14:12,641 --> 00:14:15,001
I swear, so help me God.

136
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:30,321
"Consider yourself
a gentleman amongst gentlemen!"

137
00:14:30,561 --> 00:14:33,041
Konrad Adenauer, 1961

138
00:14:33,241 --> 00:14:37,881
Dr Schwarzhaupt, your appointment
as Germany's first female minister

139
00:14:38,081 --> 00:14:41,121
leaves us with the small dilemma
of how address you.

140
00:14:41,401 --> 00:14:43,881
"Minister"
or the female form "Ministerin"?

141
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:46,921
I would say "Ministerin",
as I am a woman

142
00:14:47,161 --> 00:14:49,521
and as the German language

143
00:14:49,761 --> 00:14:52,801
has a male and a female form
for these kinds of words.

144
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:57,961
This may appear a little ungallant,
but is it perhaps worth considering

145
00:14:58,201 --> 00:15:04,201
whether a woman in politics should
or must hold a particular position

146
00:15:04,441 --> 00:15:06,801
just because she is a woman?

147
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:10,201
Your question doesn't
strike me as that ungallant.

148
00:15:10,481 --> 00:15:14,361
It's a question I've faced for
20 years, wherever I've worked.

149
00:15:14,601 --> 00:15:18,641
But personally, I've had
very encouraging experiences

150
00:15:18,881 --> 00:15:22,721
which have shown me that
women are capable of a great deal,

151
00:15:22,961 --> 00:15:26,481
because people often expect
a lot of us in other areas.

152
00:15:26,721 --> 00:15:30,641
And we contribute
something different to a man.

153
00:15:31,361 --> 00:15:34,601
If I were to work like a man
and talk like a man,

154
00:15:34,841 --> 00:15:39,001
I may as well have sent
my husband here 20 years ago.

155
00:15:39,241 --> 00:15:43,281
But this isn't the case.
"Vive la difference", if you will.

156
00:15:43,521 --> 00:15:46,881
We all make our own unique
contribution to get the job done.

157
00:16:38,241 --> 00:16:40,561
REBEL WOMEN

158
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:44,441
- There's no one around to decide.
- Gentlemen!

159
00:16:44,681 --> 00:16:49,241
In the hour of need,
decisive decisions must be decided!

160
00:16:49,481 --> 00:16:53,121
And in the history of humankind,
there were always plucky women

161
00:16:53,361 --> 00:16:55,281
who stepped in to save the day.

162
00:16:55,521 --> 00:16:59,441
I'm the firm's longest-serving
employee, so I'm in command here!

163
00:17:00,401 --> 00:17:02,681
Good heavens!

164
00:17:03,521 --> 00:17:07,441
The women fought their battles
alone at first, each to her own.

165
00:17:07,681 --> 00:17:12,441
And then in the 1970s, women
discovered each other, as it were,

166
00:17:12,681 --> 00:17:15,241
women who were
in the same situation.

167
00:17:15,481 --> 00:17:20,681
We stopped competing against each other
for that one post allocated to a woman.

168
00:17:20,921 --> 00:17:26,761
Instead, we joined forces to fight for
the creation of more "women's posts".

169
00:17:27,001 --> 00:17:31,801
I started to get interested in politics
and to take part in political events.

170
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,801
Up until then,
I didn't believe in my abilities…

171
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:39,081
I should add that I was married to
someone who didn't believe in them either.

172
00:17:39,361 --> 00:17:43,721
And I started to go to political
events and suddenly I realised:

173
00:17:43,961 --> 00:17:46,561
"Oh, people listen
when you make a point."

174
00:17:46,801 --> 00:17:50,201
I suddenly felt two metres taller
and really validated,

175
00:17:50,481 --> 00:17:54,201
and worked up the courage
to really get involved.

176
00:17:54,761 --> 00:17:58,801
How do you manage to balance
your career and your family life?

177
00:17:59,841 --> 00:18:04,521
Unfortunately, this is a question that
people only ask female politicians.

178
00:18:04,961 --> 00:18:07,321
You have to make compromises

179
00:18:07,601 --> 00:18:10,001
and organise your
life a bit differently,

180
00:18:10,241 --> 00:18:12,841
but you manage it,
just like business women

181
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,001
and farmer's wives do.

182
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:18,841
The father of my children couldn't
deal with this new role at all.

183
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:24,241
Suddenly I'd stopped being the person
who idolised him as "lord and master"

184
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:26,241
and kept my mouth shut.

185
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:30,161
I developed my own opinions. He
couldn't handle it and we separated.

186
00:18:30,441 --> 00:18:34,281
In '68 I did my final exams in Berlin
and then went back to Tübingen,

187
00:18:34,521 --> 00:18:38,121
where I was chair of the
district authority for a while.

188
00:18:38,321 --> 00:18:42,841
And then from 1970, I led the
Social Democrat women's wing

189
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,081
in Baden-Württemberg,

190
00:18:45,321 --> 00:18:49,561
somewhat to the horror
of the top brass in the region.

191
00:18:49,801 --> 00:18:53,521
They weren't too happy
about our good-natured "onslaught".

192
00:18:53,761 --> 00:18:58,201
Because of course we said that in the
upcoming local government elections

193
00:18:58,481 --> 00:19:02,041
we wanted to increase the share
of women on the municipal councils

194
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,441
by at least 50 percent,
if not more.

195
00:19:04,681 --> 00:19:09,201
And to achieve this, we examined
the internal party regulations,

196
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:12,361
worked out how to
put together a budget,

197
00:19:12,601 --> 00:19:15,201
how to present ourselves,

198
00:19:15,441 --> 00:19:19,161
how men typically behave
when they're on committees

199
00:19:19,401 --> 00:19:22,441
how they negate women,
how we can tackle this, and so on.

200
00:19:22,681 --> 00:19:25,681
We really enjoyed it,
and it was a success, too.

201
00:19:27,241 --> 00:19:30,321
My name is Herta Däubler-Gmelin,
I'm 29 years old,

202
00:19:30,561 --> 00:19:34,121
I've been an MP since 19 November,
and I'm also a Swabian.

203
00:19:37,601 --> 00:19:40,801
"In parliament a woman
on her own is like a flower,

204
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,641
en masse, they are like weeds."

205
00:19:43,881 --> 00:19:46,641
<i>Throughout history
A wind of emancipation has blown</i>

206
00:19:46,881 --> 00:19:49,641
<i>From humans to infusoria</i>

207
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:53,481
<i>Women everywhere
want to seize the throne</i>

208
00:19:53,721 --> 00:19:57,561
<i>From the Amazons
to the little madams in Berlin</i>

209
00:19:58,001 --> 00:20:01,361
<i>A thundering roar can be heard</i>

210
00:20:02,361 --> 00:20:06,081
<i>"What the men can do
we learned long ago</i>

211
00:20:06,401 --> 00:20:09,761
<i>And maybe we can do it better too!"</i>

212
00:20:10,321 --> 00:20:13,681
<i>Out of the Reichstag, out they go!</i>

213
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:17,081
<i>Out of the Landtag, out they go!</i>

214
00:20:17,361 --> 00:20:20,441
<i>Out of their manly manors,
out they go!</i>

215
00:20:20,681 --> 00:20:23,801
<i>We'll make them ours,
don't you know?</i>

216
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,721
<i>Get the men out of here</i>

217
00:20:26,961 --> 00:20:29,801
<i>Get the men out of there</i>

218
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,761
<i>Get the men out of everywhere</i>

219
00:20:33,001 --> 00:20:35,641
<i>They've been around too long,
I swear</i>

220
00:20:35,881 --> 00:20:38,401
<i>Out of that house, out they trot</i>

221
00:20:38,641 --> 00:20:42,161
<i>It's time that the
women had a shot!</i>

222
00:20:57,081 --> 00:20:58,841
- May I?
- Be my guest.

223
00:21:07,441 --> 00:21:10,201
Try that on with the matron,
Mr Körtler.

224
00:21:10,441 --> 00:21:14,161
- You'll get a smack in the face.
- Well, she might not like it.

225
00:21:14,761 --> 00:21:17,121
But you do.
It's clear as day.

226
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,121
You're mistaken.

227
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:21,921
I'm going easy on you
because you're sick.

228
00:21:22,601 --> 00:21:25,801
I don't feel that sick, actually.

229
00:21:29,241 --> 00:21:30,921
The cheek!

230
00:21:31,521 --> 00:21:33,401
- What's up?
- Oh, nothing…

231
00:21:33,641 --> 00:21:37,201
- Some people think nurses are fair game!
- It's just harmless fun.

232
00:21:37,801 --> 00:21:42,201
Before the summer recess, there was a big
education policy debate in the Bundestag

233
00:21:42,481 --> 00:21:45,281
and I was giving the last speech.

234
00:21:45,521 --> 00:21:50,201
I made my way back to my seat
and when I was halfway there,

235
00:21:50,441 --> 00:21:52,841
Stücklen blocked my path and said,

236
00:21:53,081 --> 00:21:56,721
"Ms Schuchardt…" And then
he ran his thumb down my back.

237
00:21:57,481 --> 00:22:00,681
And suddenly
he gave the CSU a thumbs-up.

238
00:22:01,281 --> 00:22:03,281
I said, "What was that about?"

239
00:22:03,961 --> 00:22:07,081
"We made a bet:
Is she wearing a bra or not?"

240
00:22:07,561 --> 00:22:09,601
So I said, "And?"
"She's not."

241
00:22:10,001 --> 00:22:12,641
Someone must have
tipped off the press.

242
00:22:13,361 --> 00:22:17,361
The summer recess was over and
I thought, "Oh, God, how terrible!"

243
00:22:17,601 --> 00:22:20,001
So I went to the
Executive Committee HQ

244
00:22:20,241 --> 00:22:23,601
and said, "Mr Stücklen, I'm sorry.
I didn't tell the press."

245
00:22:24,201 --> 00:22:27,841
And he actually said to me,
"Oh, don't worry, Ms Schuchardt,

246
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:30,321
it boosted my liberal image."

247
00:22:30,601 --> 00:22:33,361
You had to learn to
fend off the advances

248
00:22:33,601 --> 00:22:37,961
without becoming the man's arch
enemy in the parliamentary group.

249
00:22:38,281 --> 00:22:42,121
Let me put this bluntly:
we have nothing against old men,

250
00:22:42,481 --> 00:22:46,521
nor do we have anything against
old women, or against young women.

251
00:22:46,761 --> 00:22:49,561
I'll just add that too. But… but…

252
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:55,441
Dear Ms… Ms Nickels,
Ms Hickel, Ms Vollmer, Ms Schoppe,

253
00:22:55,681 --> 00:22:58,401
we'll all grow old one day.

254
00:22:58,641 --> 00:23:03,321
It's true that some of you
look pretty good, but…

255
00:23:04,161 --> 00:23:08,241
But… back to the topic of old men,
I'll say this much:

256
00:23:08,481 --> 00:23:13,241
the ravages of time
are also taking their toll on you,

257
00:23:13,481 --> 00:23:15,441
I'll just point that out.

258
00:23:15,681 --> 00:23:18,921
You really had to master this game:

259
00:23:19,161 --> 00:23:23,921
fend him off,
but don't slight him as a man.

260
00:23:24,161 --> 00:23:26,721
It was the same
in all parliamentary groups.

261
00:23:26,921 --> 00:23:30,921
And I'm sorry to say that
journalists also made passes on us.

262
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:34,761
<i>One of the most taboo subjects
in the political arena</i>

263
00:23:34,961 --> 00:23:38,041
<i>is the private life
of politicians in Bonn.</i>

264
00:23:38,281 --> 00:23:42,681
<i>A Sunday paper and the Greens have
now lifted this veil of discretion.</i>

265
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:45,761
<i>The Green Party MP Klaus
Hecker from Kronberg in Hessen</i>

266
00:23:46,001 --> 00:23:47,841
<i>has come under fire</i>

267
00:23:48,081 --> 00:23:52,401
<i>for allegedly groping the breasts of
Green Party parliamentary group staff,</i>

268
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,561
<i>to put it rather crudely.</i>

269
00:23:54,961 --> 00:23:58,441
Ms Schoppe, is there any truth to
the allegations against Mr Hecker?

270
00:23:59,081 --> 00:24:03,121
Yes, Mr Hecker did indeed
touch the breasts of three women.

271
00:24:03,401 --> 00:24:06,681
Wouldn't it be better to solve
this conflict on a personal level

272
00:24:06,921 --> 00:24:09,401
instead of reaching
for the political cudgel?

273
00:24:09,641 --> 00:24:12,721
A slap in the face
wouldn't have been unreasonable.

274
00:24:12,961 --> 00:24:15,201
If it had been an
isolated incident,

275
00:24:15,481 --> 00:24:19,441
a conflict between Klaus Hecker
and one woman, but it's not.

276
00:24:19,681 --> 00:24:22,841
It's a problem in society
and we want to highlight this.

277
00:24:23,081 --> 00:24:26,401
What do you think about
breast-grabbing and bum-pinching?

278
00:24:27,201 --> 00:24:30,241
- It's a hot topic.
- No one does that to me anymore!

279
00:24:30,561 --> 00:24:35,001
You shouldn't do it at work, but in
your free time, I think it's fine.

280
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:38,641
If it was something extra special,
then I would do it.

281
00:24:38,881 --> 00:24:41,921
Have you ever thought
of doing something like that?

282
00:24:42,161 --> 00:24:46,041
- Thought about it? I've done it!
- And what happened?

283
00:24:46,241 --> 00:24:50,161
Nothing. The woman said it was
nice. But I wasn't in the Bundestag.

284
00:24:50,401 --> 00:24:52,601
I looked after VIPs at the airport,

285
00:24:52,841 --> 00:24:56,321
all the politicians who were "in"
back then: Strauß, Stücklen…

286
00:24:56,561 --> 00:25:01,161
I have to say that during
my time working at the airport,

287
00:25:01,401 --> 00:25:04,721
I didn't only see the politicians
in a positive light.

288
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:10,161
When I think of the MeToo debate and
some of the men I was looking after,

289
00:25:10,441 --> 00:25:14,481
who got onto the plane in the
morning, drunk out of their minds,

290
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,761
I could tell a story or two.

291
00:25:17,001 --> 00:25:20,241
I have been touched
and experienced other things.

292
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:25,481
I was at one of Richard Stücklen's events
when I was starting out in politics.

293
00:25:25,721 --> 00:25:30,161
I came in and he said, "She's not
married. But she's not that ugly."

294
00:25:30,441 --> 00:25:32,801
I would just have loved to…

295
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:36,721
If all those people hadn't been
there, I would have slapped him.

296
00:25:36,961 --> 00:25:39,441
<i>A helping hand for
lawyer Friedrich Bohl,</i>

297
00:25:39,681 --> 00:25:42,721
<i>a member of Hesse State
Parliament since 1970.</i>

298
00:25:42,961 --> 00:25:44,681
<i>His next stop: Bonn.</i>

299
00:25:44,921 --> 00:25:49,161
<i>Richard Stücklen explains to Mrs
Bohl what she has let herself in for.</i>

300
00:25:50,681 --> 00:25:54,721
If my wife hadn't showed me
so much understanding,

301
00:25:55,161 --> 00:25:59,401
I would never have achieved
what I have in politics

302
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,801
- over the last 31 years.
- I bet!

303
00:26:03,041 --> 00:26:06,801
You won't get anywhere
if you don't have the right wife.

304
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:10,561
Some people also trivialise
the MeToo debate today.

305
00:26:12,441 --> 00:26:17,441
If women had spoken out sooner, people
in these areas might have developed

306
00:26:17,681 --> 00:26:20,001
a different kind of awareness.

307
00:27:15,361 --> 00:27:24,121
GERMANY
UNDER THE COVERS

308
00:27:31,881 --> 00:27:34,761
I'd like to say a few words
about yesterday evening,

309
00:27:35,001 --> 00:27:37,601
ladies and gentlemen.

310
00:27:37,841 --> 00:27:42,361
The loutish behaviour here last
night was simply unacceptable.

311
00:27:43,321 --> 00:27:46,881
You really have to raise your game,
gentlemen,

312
00:27:47,081 --> 00:27:51,001
to stop the values of this house
going completely to the dogs.

313
00:27:56,281 --> 00:28:00,961
The debate around Paragraph 218
has started once again.

314
00:28:01,161 --> 00:28:04,441
This paragraph,
which sets out certain conditions

315
00:28:04,681 --> 00:28:07,921
to allow a woman to
terminate a pregnancy,

316
00:28:08,161 --> 00:28:12,601
has not lessened the suffering women
must endure when they have an abortion.

317
00:28:12,841 --> 00:28:16,161
If you listen to it again,
it was a very unemotional speech.

318
00:28:16,441 --> 00:28:20,081
She didn't really raise her voice.

319
00:28:20,401 --> 00:28:23,441
She spoke rather quietly.

320
00:28:24,481 --> 00:28:27,841
She probably knew what was coming
and was bracing herself.

321
00:28:29,161 --> 00:28:33,321
We are in a society which is
standardising living conditions,

322
00:28:33,561 --> 00:28:36,401
creating standard fashions,
standard flats,

323
00:28:36,641 --> 00:28:40,441
standard opinions,
and also standard morals.

324
00:28:41,401 --> 00:28:45,201
As a result, we now have couples
going to bed in the evening

325
00:28:45,441 --> 00:28:49,281
and performing a standard drill
before going to sleep.

326
00:28:49,521 --> 00:28:54,081
Which often involves the man performing
a reckless act of penetration.

327
00:28:55,001 --> 00:28:57,601
I say reckless, because most men

328
00:28:57,841 --> 00:29:01,321
do not take any steps
to prevent pregnancy.

329
00:29:01,561 --> 00:29:03,441
I admired her for it.

330
00:29:03,681 --> 00:29:08,361
I probably wouldn't have chosen those
words in the Bundestag at that time,

331
00:29:08,601 --> 00:29:10,241
but I agreed with them.

332
00:29:10,481 --> 00:29:13,201
That speech was a moment to rejoice

333
00:29:13,441 --> 00:29:16,921
for all women interested or
involved in the women's movement.

334
00:29:17,161 --> 00:29:21,081
No one had ever spoken like that
in the Bundestag before.

335
00:29:21,281 --> 00:29:25,001
We are calling for spousal rape
to be made a punishable act.

336
00:29:25,641 --> 00:29:28,921
We are asking you
to finally acknowledge

337
00:29:29,161 --> 00:29:34,161
that women also have a right to determine
what happens to their bodies and lives.

338
00:29:34,401 --> 00:29:36,121
We are asking all of you

339
00:29:36,361 --> 00:29:40,881
to put a stop to the everyday
sexism here in parliament.

340
00:29:55,441 --> 00:29:59,521
The atmosphere during Waltraud
Schoppe's speech was just disgusting.

341
00:29:59,761 --> 00:30:02,801
Calling someone a "witch"
may not be very nice,

342
00:30:03,041 --> 00:30:05,561
but it's not below the belt.

343
00:30:05,801 --> 00:30:08,921
They shouted out things
that were clearly sexual.

344
00:30:09,161 --> 00:30:13,481
Things like: "No one wants
to sleep with you anyway."

345
00:30:13,721 --> 00:30:18,561
Really nasty things that
I'd never expected MPs to say.

346
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,441
I can see I've
said the right thing:

347
00:30:37,721 --> 00:30:39,841
I've touched a nerve.

348
00:30:47,041 --> 00:30:49,641
It was, well…

349
00:30:50,201 --> 00:30:53,921
it was awkward for
the men at times.

350
00:30:54,161 --> 00:30:58,161
You really felt sorry for the men
who had to make such a racket

351
00:30:58,401 --> 00:31:00,321
when she said certain things

352
00:31:00,561 --> 00:31:05,441
because they felt that their
innermost being was under attack,

353
00:31:05,681 --> 00:31:10,241
that they were no longer accepted
as the natural rulers of the world.

354
00:31:10,481 --> 00:31:15,201
Our male colleagues hadn't realised
how they actually treated us.

355
00:31:15,441 --> 00:31:18,961
To them, we were like
pretty trimmings, little flowers,

356
00:31:19,161 --> 00:31:22,441
but not necessarily
serious politicians

357
00:31:22,681 --> 00:31:25,641
who had as much to say as they did.

358
00:31:26,001 --> 00:31:28,041
It would be a real turning point

359
00:31:28,281 --> 00:31:31,601
if we had a chancellor up here,
for example,

360
00:31:31,841 --> 00:31:34,521
who pointed out to us all

361
00:31:34,761 --> 00:31:38,761
that there are forms of lovemaking
which are sensual

362
00:31:39,001 --> 00:31:43,001
and which completely eliminate
the chance of getting pregnant.

363
00:31:45,481 --> 00:31:50,961
However, you can only talk about
something if you understand it a little.

364
00:31:55,161 --> 00:31:58,761
In all seriousness, I'd never
discuss this with the chancellor.

365
00:31:58,961 --> 00:32:01,001
Anyone whose policies…

366
00:32:03,761 --> 00:32:09,001
whose policies destroy the environment,
and enable inhumane activities,

367
00:32:09,241 --> 00:32:14,121
has forfeited the chance of being part
of the conversation about sensuality.

368
00:32:19,361 --> 00:32:22,321
The floor is yours: Mr Kleinert,
Hanover.

369
00:32:24,641 --> 00:32:26,321
President…

370
00:32:27,801 --> 00:32:31,001
Ladies and gentlemen.

371
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:33,921
We are not half as uptight

372
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:38,121
as I would imagine
many people may now think…

373
00:32:43,401 --> 00:32:46,681
after hearing that speech just now.

374
00:32:52,401 --> 00:32:56,401
There are many different people
living in this land,

375
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,961
very healthy, balanced,

376
00:32:59,201 --> 00:33:03,041
and merry people…
merry in a perfectly healthy way.

377
00:33:03,241 --> 00:33:08,161
But they don't make their lifestyle
the topic of a plenary debate.

378
00:33:13,161 --> 00:33:16,801
If I remember correctly, it was
your first speech in the Bundestag

379
00:33:17,001 --> 00:33:19,241
and you're met with this torrent…

380
00:33:19,521 --> 00:33:23,281
of jocularity, but it didn't
feel friendly or relaxed,

381
00:33:23,521 --> 00:33:26,201
at least as far as I saw it…

382
00:33:27,161 --> 00:33:30,081
It was more like you
were being jeered at.

383
00:33:30,721 --> 00:33:36,521
Well, I have to say: I never expected
the parliament to be jocular or relaxed.

384
00:33:37,041 --> 00:33:41,881
And when they started laughing
and attacking me,

385
00:33:42,161 --> 00:33:47,441
I thought to myself: "There's still
a lot of groundwork to be done here."

386
00:33:47,681 --> 00:33:50,081
And that's what us
women plan to do.

387
00:34:19,161 --> 00:34:26,481
WAR AND PEACE

388
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:34,201
TODAY IN PARLIAMENT

389
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:41,001
NATO'S DUAL-TRACK DECISION

390
00:34:41,841 --> 00:34:46,641
The foreign policy of this country
is hanging in the balance.

391
00:34:47,601 --> 00:34:50,681
We must not allow
the Soviet Union to succeed,

392
00:34:51,121 --> 00:34:54,921
aided by its colossal efforts
to expand its armaments,

393
00:34:55,121 --> 00:34:57,081
which cannot be justified

394
00:34:57,321 --> 00:35:01,481
by any discernible
defence or security concerns,

395
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:05,041
in intimidating us here
in Western Europe,

396
00:35:05,281 --> 00:35:08,561
in curtailing our freedom to act
on the political stage

397
00:35:08,801 --> 00:35:11,881
and in breaking our ties
with the United States.

398
00:35:28,121 --> 00:35:32,801
President, ladies and gentlemen, first
I'd like to ask you not to laugh.

399
00:35:33,121 --> 00:35:36,681
The chain around my neck
isn't carnival decoration.

400
00:35:36,921 --> 00:35:41,001
In Hiroshima and Japan, it is more
highly regarded than our Order of Merit.

401
00:35:41,241 --> 00:35:45,081
And I'd ask you to give the chain
the respect it deserves.

402
00:35:49,641 --> 00:35:52,121
It's made up of a thousand cranes.

403
00:35:52,321 --> 00:35:56,321
The crane is Japan's national
symbol for happiness and peace.

404
00:35:56,801 --> 00:35:59,561
And there's an old
legend that goes:

405
00:35:59,801 --> 00:36:04,681
Fold 1,000 cranes and you will be granted
happiness, blessings and a long life.

406
00:36:04,921 --> 00:36:07,601
And after the bomb fell,

407
00:36:07,841 --> 00:36:11,441
a lot of survivors in a state
of misery and desperation,

408
00:36:11,681 --> 00:36:13,761
were emboldened by this thought

409
00:36:14,001 --> 00:36:16,481
and they tried to fold 1,000 cranes

410
00:36:16,721 --> 00:36:19,881
before they died
from the radiation.

411
00:36:20,121 --> 00:36:25,001
In 1982 I helped launch
the peace movement in my region.

412
00:36:25,241 --> 00:36:28,801
And I started
a women's peace movement on purpose

413
00:36:29,001 --> 00:36:31,241
because I realised

414
00:36:31,521 --> 00:36:35,921
that it could help counteract the
negative image of the peace movement,

415
00:36:36,121 --> 00:36:39,921
that everyone was controlled
by Moscow or they were freaks,

416
00:36:40,121 --> 00:36:43,321
that they have nothing better
to do all day than protest,

417
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:46,321
if mothers, grandmas
and children were part of it.

418
00:36:46,561 --> 00:36:50,121
So we weaved shut the gates of
barracks, organised breakfasts…

419
00:36:50,361 --> 00:36:55,001
The Commanding Officer even turned
up on his bike to take a secret look.

420
00:36:55,201 --> 00:36:59,241
They weren't counting on any of that
and it turned their world upside down.

421
00:37:22,561 --> 00:37:24,201
Ms Nickels,

422
00:37:24,441 --> 00:37:30,001
Your dismay at the consequences of
the disaster in Hiroshima is moving.

423
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:33,001
I share this dismay,

424
00:37:33,241 --> 00:37:35,481
because as a child

425
00:37:35,721 --> 00:37:40,521
I experienced the night-time bombing raids
in my native Koblenz, which lay in ruins.

426
00:37:40,761 --> 00:37:43,121
I was buried alive twice.

427
00:37:43,401 --> 00:37:47,441
So I know what
horrors war can bring.

428
00:37:48,401 --> 00:37:51,401
I also know from
what he has told me,

429
00:37:51,641 --> 00:37:53,961
that our chancellor Helmut Kohl

430
00:37:54,201 --> 00:37:57,081
also suffered very personal losses
in the war.

431
00:37:58,121 --> 00:38:01,681
Aged 13 he was enlisted
in a school fire-fighting squad

432
00:38:01,921 --> 00:38:04,721
during the bombing
raids in Ludwigshafen.

433
00:38:04,961 --> 00:38:09,201
And his brother died as a soldier.

434
00:38:09,721 --> 00:38:14,121
Well, Helmut Kohl was an emotional
man, it's important to know that.

435
00:38:14,401 --> 00:38:20,161
And I recall getting down from the
lectern and going down those two steps,

436
00:38:20,521 --> 00:38:23,561
and going past
where the chancellor was sitting.

437
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:27,801
He placed his paw on my shoulder
as a gesture of recognition,

438
00:38:28,041 --> 00:38:30,561
and told me I'd done a good job.

439
00:38:30,881 --> 00:38:34,681
What I find so awful is that
many people in the peace movement

440
00:38:34,921 --> 00:38:39,001
are turning this dispute
into a debate on basic principles.

441
00:38:39,761 --> 00:38:43,561
That they view themselves
as the "public conscience"

442
00:38:43,801 --> 00:38:47,721
and destroy peace within our
country with their intolerance.

443
00:38:51,361 --> 00:38:55,161
I reject the claim that the peace
movement is fear-mongering.

444
00:38:55,401 --> 00:38:59,001
The fearmongers are sitting
over there on the government bench,

445
00:38:59,201 --> 00:39:01,281
spreading fear among us.

446
00:39:01,961 --> 00:39:06,001
If our methods of peaceful
resistance and civil disobedience

447
00:39:06,241 --> 00:39:08,961
transgress legal
regulations and laws,

448
00:39:09,121 --> 00:39:14,041
it's because we rely on a higher
law, the law of our conscience,

449
00:39:14,281 --> 00:39:17,561
and because we know that the
power of the state is not absolute.

450
00:39:17,801 --> 00:39:21,601
Petra Kelly was already an icon
back then. To some, she was a saint.

451
00:39:22,201 --> 00:39:24,201
To others, she was…

452
00:39:25,401 --> 00:39:28,281
They didn't have
a terribly positive opinion of her.

453
00:39:28,521 --> 00:39:31,641
But the women were strong,
they were really strong,

454
00:39:31,881 --> 00:39:34,361
and not just about
the NATO decision.

455
00:39:34,601 --> 00:39:39,161
Another huge issue was Wackersdorf,
the reprocessing plant in Bavaria,

456
00:39:39,401 --> 00:39:41,881
and women were
incredibly active there.

457
00:39:42,121 --> 00:39:46,081
A final word on the children
in the peace movement.

458
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,961
Parents have been shamed

459
00:39:49,201 --> 00:39:54,281
for bringing their children along
to the peace protest on 22 October.

460
00:39:55,081 --> 00:39:59,161
I have three children of my own
and I can tell you this:

461
00:39:59,441 --> 00:40:01,641
it's more the other way around.

462
00:40:01,881 --> 00:40:05,921
Children as young as ten
are taking their parents with them.

463
00:40:06,361 --> 00:40:08,761
Two topics…
Yes, I think that's good.

464
00:40:09,001 --> 00:40:12,481
There are two topics
close to their hearts:

465
00:40:12,721 --> 00:40:15,321
The death of the forests
and expanding armaments.

466
00:40:16,121 --> 00:40:20,841
I'd like to conclude my speech with
a banner carried by young people

467
00:40:21,241 --> 00:40:24,201
which read: "You treat the planet

468
00:40:24,441 --> 00:40:27,721
as if you had another
one in the cellar."

469
00:40:28,521 --> 00:40:31,321
Let's show them
that they were wrong.

470
00:40:33,801 --> 00:40:37,721
It was women, and women
across all political parties,

471
00:40:37,961 --> 00:40:41,721
who approached the debate
on armaments, for example,

472
00:40:41,961 --> 00:40:45,001
by addressing the real problems
far more than the men.

473
00:40:45,241 --> 00:40:50,081
This made me very happy to
feel that something does unite us.

474
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:54,001
I won't pretend it's all harmonious,
but there is a consensus,

475
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:57,721
perhaps because they're much more
connected to everyday life.

476
00:40:58,481 --> 00:41:03,121
As long as we're governed by men
who only have missiles on the mind,

477
00:41:03,361 --> 00:41:07,681
and not much else going on
up there, things will not improve.

478
00:41:07,921 --> 00:41:12,881
This country doesn't need new missiles.
What this country needs is new men.

479
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:27,121
READING THE RIOT ACT

480
00:41:56,241 --> 00:42:00,121
VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE IN
HELMUT SCHMIDT 1 OCTOBER 1982

481
00:42:00,321 --> 00:42:02,081
President.

482
00:42:03,081 --> 00:42:06,801
Dear colleagues.

483
00:42:08,241 --> 00:42:11,761
I cannot express my lack of
confidence in the chancellor

484
00:42:12,121 --> 00:42:15,161
considering that
only a few months ago

485
00:42:15,441 --> 00:42:17,801
I expressed my confidence in him.

486
00:42:20,521 --> 00:42:23,761
I don't think either of these
gentlemen deserve this.

487
00:42:24,001 --> 00:42:27,481
Helmut Schmidt being toppled
without the say of the electorate,

488
00:42:27,721 --> 00:42:31,921
and you, Helmut Kohl, becoming chancellor
without the say of the electorate.

489
00:42:38,441 --> 00:42:41,041
Hildegard Hamm-Brücher
was a very respected politician

490
00:42:41,241 --> 00:42:46,001
who held some really fantastic
speeches in the Bundestag.

491
00:42:46,401 --> 00:42:50,321
She wasn't easy,
nor were her dealings with women.

492
00:42:50,561 --> 00:42:54,761
She wasn't a "woman's woman",
we said back then.

493
00:42:55,001 --> 00:42:58,881
It wasn't a given that she
would stand up for other women.

494
00:42:59,121 --> 00:43:03,241
But then the situation arose
that we're all familiar with…

495
00:43:03,521 --> 00:43:05,761
with the vote of no confidence.

496
00:43:06,721 --> 00:43:08,801
And it was absolutely clear to us

497
00:43:09,041 --> 00:43:13,041
once we'd decided to vote against
it, that she would give the speech.

498
00:43:13,401 --> 00:43:18,121
In my opinion,
both of these courses of action

499
00:43:18,361 --> 00:43:22,481
leave the unsavoury aftertaste
of violated democratic principles.

500
00:43:22,721 --> 00:43:26,521
One could say that they damage
the moral and ethical integrity

501
00:43:26,761 --> 00:43:28,641
of power changeovers.

502
00:43:28,881 --> 00:43:30,801
And this is not…

503
00:43:34,321 --> 00:43:36,201
This is not…

504
00:43:38,361 --> 00:43:42,601
I'm sorry, but that's how I see it. You
don't, and you also made that clear.

505
00:43:42,841 --> 00:43:46,201
This is not an acceptable
course of action.

506
00:43:46,561 --> 00:43:51,241
It was clear to us all that this
speech had set off an earthquake,

507
00:43:51,481 --> 00:43:56,481
and then that this would send
shockwaves throughout the FDP.

508
00:43:56,841 --> 00:44:01,041
Just two years ago,
the voters gave a clear mandate

509
00:44:01,281 --> 00:44:05,561
in favour of a
social-liberal coalition.

510
00:44:06,121 --> 00:44:08,641
So we have to consult the voters

511
00:44:08,881 --> 00:44:11,121
before we change this arrangement.

512
00:44:17,641 --> 00:44:21,281
<i>Handshake between
Dr Hildegard Hamm-Brücher</i>

513
00:44:21,521 --> 00:44:23,641
<i>and Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.</i>

514
00:44:23,881 --> 00:44:27,961
<i>That was a very personal
and succinct explanation</i>

515
00:44:28,201 --> 00:44:32,601
<i>of how she will choose to vote
in the upcoming ballot.</i>

516
00:44:34,961 --> 00:44:38,881
Some of what I have
heard here today, the pleas,

517
00:44:39,401 --> 00:44:42,681
the grievances and the emotions,

518
00:44:42,921 --> 00:44:45,801
can only be viewed

519
00:44:46,041 --> 00:44:49,321
as an attack on our constitution.

520
00:44:58,841 --> 00:45:02,601
When a member of parliament
chooses to express their opinion,

521
00:45:03,721 --> 00:45:07,121
be they male or female members,

522
00:45:08,281 --> 00:45:11,801
and state that they will act
according to their conscience,

523
00:45:12,881 --> 00:45:18,601
and this is then described
as an attack on our constitution…

524
00:45:22,881 --> 00:45:25,641
as an attack on our constitution,

525
00:45:27,321 --> 00:45:29,681
then the leadership of the…

526
00:45:30,321 --> 00:45:34,961
I only intend to say three sentences
and I ask you to please hear me out.

527
00:45:35,161 --> 00:45:38,081
I still have the
right to speak here!

528
00:45:44,161 --> 00:45:48,561
This constitution is a moral
institution of German politics.

529
00:45:48,801 --> 00:45:51,081
And if within this constitution,

530
00:45:51,321 --> 00:45:56,521
whether it suits one person more than
another in a particular situation,

531
00:45:56,761 --> 00:46:00,241
we reach decisions, we work,
we fight for a cause,

532
00:46:00,481 --> 00:46:02,561
this cannot be viewed as immoral,

533
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:05,921
nor as unchristian,
as the honourable lady suggests.

534
00:46:14,321 --> 00:46:16,241
<i>The MP Dr Helmut Kohl</i>

535
00:46:16,481 --> 00:46:20,681
<i>has been elected as Chancellor
of the Federal Republic of Germany.</i>

536
00:46:28,761 --> 00:46:33,601
For the voters, electing Helmut
Kohl was a serious breach of trust.

537
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:37,321
It violated what had been promised
before the election.

538
00:46:37,601 --> 00:46:41,241
And we weren't alone:
the people were up in arms.

539
00:46:41,481 --> 00:46:44,041
It went against
the principle of good faith

540
00:46:44,241 --> 00:46:47,081
and that's also why

541
00:46:47,281 --> 00:46:51,241
I was so upset with Genscher,
who'd kept it secret to the last.

542
00:46:52,001 --> 00:46:53,641
We never spoke again.

543
00:46:54,401 --> 00:46:58,641
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm a real
veteran of the party conference circuit.

544
00:46:58,881 --> 00:47:04,281
I've attended most of the conferences that
have taken place in Germany since 1967,

545
00:47:04,561 --> 00:47:08,761
but I've never experienced a conference
where so many tears have been shed.

546
00:47:09,001 --> 00:47:12,361
Something really must have happened
within this party.

547
00:47:12,801 --> 00:47:15,201
I hope that you will understand

548
00:47:15,481 --> 00:47:21,161
that as a matter of self-respect in
view of the outcome of these events,

549
00:47:21,401 --> 00:47:24,121
I will not run for
the National Board of the FDP.

550
00:47:24,881 --> 00:47:29,321
<i>There was more to come: for Ingrid
Matthäus-Maier, re-electing Genscher</i>

551
00:47:29,601 --> 00:47:34,041
<i>and approving the power handover in
Bonn meant a loss of face for the FDP</i>

552
00:47:34,281 --> 00:47:37,281
<i>and a new centre-right,
pro-business stance.</i>

553
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:40,801
<i>Final concerns,
final advice, final objections,</i>

554
00:47:41,041 --> 00:47:46,121
<i>but they will not change her mind: the
FDP is no longer her political home</i>

555
00:47:46,401 --> 00:47:48,961
<i>and for a few moments
the conference</i>

556
00:47:49,161 --> 00:47:52,121
<i>loses its business-like mood
when she explains:</i>

557
00:47:52,361 --> 00:47:56,001
So I have decided
to resign from my posts in the FDP

558
00:47:56,201 --> 00:47:58,481
and to leave the FDP.

559
00:48:23,201 --> 00:48:26,201
<i>She is not the only one
to leave the party that evening,</i>

560
00:48:26,441 --> 00:48:28,361
<i>others hesitate, at a loss.</i>

561
00:48:28,601 --> 00:48:32,001
<i>Will this spark an exodus from
the FDP after the conference?</i>

562
00:48:32,241 --> 00:48:33,761
<i>This is what many fear.</i>

563
00:48:33,961 --> 00:48:37,521
And that's what happened too,
with some tragic results.

564
00:48:38,281 --> 00:48:40,241
I saw friendships

565
00:48:40,481 --> 00:48:44,401
and even marriages fall apart
because of the change of coalition.

566
00:48:44,641 --> 00:48:49,001
Life changed for a lot of us
after that. For me, for example.

567
00:48:49,481 --> 00:48:54,961
There was never any doubt about it.
I could never have voted for Kohl.

568
00:48:55,601 --> 00:48:57,841
And I knew only too well

569
00:48:58,081 --> 00:49:02,361
that my career as a politician
would suffer as a result.

570
00:49:05,041 --> 00:49:08,921
TAKING A CHANCE ON MORE WOMEN

571
00:50:18,841 --> 00:50:21,081
May I introduce you
to the chancellor?

572
00:50:21,361 --> 00:50:25,201
He'll be happy to finally
meet the chairwoman of a…

573
00:50:25,441 --> 00:50:30,321
May I introduce Ms Matthäus? The
chairwoman of our Young Democrats.

574
00:50:30,561 --> 00:50:33,361
So you've already had dealings
with each other?

575
00:50:33,601 --> 00:50:35,441
Oh, yes, we have!

576
00:50:37,161 --> 00:50:42,201
<i>She is paraded around parties in Bonn
like a bird of paradise, a rare specimen,</i>

577
00:50:42,441 --> 00:50:44,241
<i>a woman who, aged 26,</i>

578
00:50:44,481 --> 00:50:48,241
<i>is head of one of the three major
political youth organisations.</i>

579
00:50:48,961 --> 00:50:52,081
<i>But Ingrid Matthäus, new
chairwoman of the Young Democrats,</i>

580
00:50:52,321 --> 00:50:54,881
<i>wants to prove herself
to her political fathers</i>

581
00:50:55,081 --> 00:50:59,081
<i>and would rather challenge than please,
especially her own party chairman.</i>

582
00:50:59,321 --> 00:51:02,401
Many people were surprised
that a woman was made chair

583
00:51:02,641 --> 00:51:05,121
of such a big organisation
for the first time.

584
00:51:05,361 --> 00:51:09,121
Do you think it's normal for a
woman to hold such a position?

585
00:51:09,361 --> 00:51:14,281
It's normal to me and it's not unusual
in our organisation, the Young Democrats,

586
00:51:14,521 --> 00:51:19,361
because we have chairwomen at
municipal, district and state level.

587
00:51:19,601 --> 00:51:24,001
But of course in public life up until
now, it certainly hasn't been the norm.

588
00:51:24,241 --> 00:51:28,881
But I hope that it will encourage
a few other women to follow suit,

589
00:51:29,081 --> 00:51:32,801
even if it doesn't solve the
fundamental problems in our society

590
00:51:33,041 --> 00:51:35,721
which still impede
female emancipation.

591
00:51:35,961 --> 00:51:38,761
I remember
what the German Press Agency wrote,

592
00:51:39,001 --> 00:51:43,641
and they weren't completely wrong:
"aggressive and attractive".

593
00:51:43,881 --> 00:51:48,281
I noticed early on that it can
be a problem as a woman,

594
00:51:48,881 --> 00:51:50,881
if you're active in the party,

595
00:51:51,161 --> 00:51:53,281
if you're decisive,

596
00:51:53,521 --> 00:51:56,441
you have a goal and are determined
to get a majority.

597
00:51:56,681 --> 00:51:59,601
If you were a man,
I'm sure that people would say,

598
00:51:59,841 --> 00:52:02,881
"Oh, he's so decisive,
he has great ideas

599
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:05,241
and goals he wants to achieve!"

600
00:52:05,481 --> 00:52:09,041
Over all my years in politics,
I can say from experience

601
00:52:09,241 --> 00:52:11,441
that when women say,

602
00:52:11,681 --> 00:52:14,481
"I want this to happen
and I'll fight for it",

603
00:52:14,721 --> 00:52:18,481
it's viewed much more critically
than if a man says it.

604
00:52:18,721 --> 00:52:21,761
A man is viewed as decisive
and not overbearing.

605
00:52:22,761 --> 00:52:24,921
As it never rains but it pours,

606
00:52:25,161 --> 00:52:27,801
our next item is about
the expulsion of men

607
00:52:28,001 --> 00:52:31,081
from the paradise
of the Green front bench,

608
00:52:31,321 --> 00:52:34,121
if indeed it ever was a paradise.

609
00:52:34,881 --> 00:52:38,481
What happened in the Green Party
is something familiar to all,

610
00:52:38,721 --> 00:52:42,361
it seems to be the norm
in the average marriage today:

611
00:52:42,601 --> 00:52:46,321
the women took command.

612
00:52:46,561 --> 00:52:50,721
In a marriage, this happens gently and
almost imperceptibly over many years.

613
00:52:50,961 --> 00:52:55,401
The ladies of the Green Party, however,
managed to railroad it through,

614
00:52:55,681 --> 00:52:59,441
in unsentimental fashion,
using brute force.

615
00:52:59,681 --> 00:53:03,881
The most rotten male chauvinists
couldn't have managed such a feat.

616
00:53:04,201 --> 00:53:08,241
We're trying out something new
and sending a signal

617
00:53:08,481 --> 00:53:12,041
to all women in our party
to get more involved

618
00:53:12,241 --> 00:53:14,241
and to women in other parties.

619
00:53:14,481 --> 00:53:18,841
And we also want to send a signal beyond
the borders of the Federal Republic

620
00:53:19,081 --> 00:53:22,361
to encourage more women
to play a part in politics.

621
00:53:22,641 --> 00:53:25,681
Six women had been elected
to the party executive

622
00:53:25,921 --> 00:53:28,281
and they almost
keeled over with shock.

623
00:53:28,561 --> 00:53:31,721
It's hard to imagine,
but the <i>FAZ</i> newspaper wrote:

624
00:53:31,961 --> 00:53:35,441
"The men dutifully licked
the boots of female emancipation

625
00:53:35,681 --> 00:53:38,041
until they kicked
them to the curb."

626
00:53:38,281 --> 00:53:42,361
Or they talked about
the "gynaecocracy", and I thought:

627
00:53:42,601 --> 00:53:47,441
"My God, if you see a group of men,
you don't say 'urolo…gracy', do you?"

628
00:53:47,681 --> 00:53:50,041
The terms they came up with!

629
00:53:50,281 --> 00:53:54,001
And these were
serious presenters and journalists,

630
00:53:54,201 --> 00:53:57,241
and this stuff just
came out of them.

631
00:53:57,481 --> 00:54:00,681
And everyone wanted
to interview you, of course.

632
00:54:00,921 --> 00:54:03,441
And it was an
interesting experience.

633
00:54:03,681 --> 00:54:06,521
I was standing next to Nowottny
and thought:

634
00:54:06,761 --> 00:54:09,881
"What's going on there?"
Because he was really small.

635
00:54:10,161 --> 00:54:15,041
He had this little transparent stool
which made him taller than me, of course.

636
00:54:15,241 --> 00:54:18,361
"Ah, that's how he does it."
I had a whale of a time!

637
00:54:19,481 --> 00:54:21,281
<i>Christa Nickels' first day</i>

638
00:54:21,521 --> 00:54:24,201
<i>as the newly elected
Green Party Secretary.</i>

639
00:54:24,441 --> 00:54:29,081
<i>On Tuesday, she took over the party helm
in the Bundestag with five other women.</i>

640
00:54:29,281 --> 00:54:33,121
<i>A surprise coup, the background of
which is gradually becoming clearer.</i>

641
00:54:33,361 --> 00:54:36,361
<i>Nervous yet high-spirited,
Nickels starts business</i>

642
00:54:36,601 --> 00:54:39,081
<i>with her colleagues
from other parties.</i>

643
00:54:40,081 --> 00:54:44,201
You shouldn't blow your own trumpet
and I don't want to praise myself,

644
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:48,321
but I do feel that I got off
to a fairly good start today.

645
00:54:48,561 --> 00:54:51,361
Of course I'm still
rough around the edges,

646
00:54:51,601 --> 00:54:54,361
I still have to settle in
and get the hang of things,

647
00:54:54,601 --> 00:54:57,361
but I've no doubt I'll manage that.

648
00:54:57,601 --> 00:55:01,121
- So gender doesn't count in this job?
- Certainly not.

649
00:55:01,321 --> 00:55:05,361
It's your intellect that counts,
and long hair doesn't stunt that.

650
00:55:05,601 --> 00:55:08,001
When we voted in
the women's executive,

651
00:55:08,241 --> 00:55:12,121
a number of women in the SPD,
left-leaning ones too,

652
00:55:12,321 --> 00:55:14,321
were completely outraged:

653
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:18,121
"There's no need to throw the
baby out with the bathwater!"

654
00:55:18,321 --> 00:55:21,081
And the women from the CSU,

655
00:55:21,281 --> 00:55:24,601
who had
really socially conservative views,

656
00:55:24,841 --> 00:55:27,761
they were really happy
and congratulated us.

657
00:55:28,001 --> 00:55:30,721
The world had gone topsy-turvy
and we thought,

658
00:55:30,961 --> 00:55:33,601
"What's got into the
women in the SPD?"

659
00:55:33,841 --> 00:55:37,161
I didn't really give
the "feminarchy" in the Green Party

660
00:55:37,441 --> 00:55:39,801
all that much thought.

661
00:55:40,481 --> 00:55:42,681
But what I will say is:

662
00:55:42,921 --> 00:55:44,961
I appreciate men

663
00:55:45,201 --> 00:55:48,801
and think that
the male perspective is important,

664
00:55:49,001 --> 00:55:51,401
but not in that excess.

665
00:55:53,241 --> 00:55:57,041
I congratulated them,
I congratulated them in writing,

666
00:55:57,241 --> 00:56:01,201
and they made that public,
of course.

667
00:56:01,521 --> 00:56:06,681
And then I got an angry letter from
my parliamentary party secretary,

668
00:56:06,921 --> 00:56:09,841
asking me if I'd taken
leave of my senses.

669
00:56:10,081 --> 00:56:13,721
Why was I supporting this nonsense
and even congratulating them?

670
00:56:13,961 --> 00:56:19,081
But without the women in the Green
Party and without the SPD women's quota,

671
00:56:19,321 --> 00:56:22,481
it would never have been possible
in the CDU.

672
00:56:22,721 --> 00:56:26,001
It's a little hard at first
to be faced by a wall of men.

673
00:56:26,241 --> 00:56:31,321
They have particular expectations of
you, they want to see if you'll "man up".

674
00:56:31,561 --> 00:56:35,761
And of course you still face prejudice.
Here's a story from the last election.

675
00:56:36,001 --> 00:56:39,681
I organised a get-together one
Sunday in a village in Upper Bavaria,

676
00:56:39,921 --> 00:56:41,561
which was a lot of work.

677
00:56:41,801 --> 00:56:44,681
After the event,
an elderly farmer came up to me:

678
00:56:44,921 --> 00:56:49,081
"You'll find a good man, my girl. Then
you won't need to do this anymore."

679
00:56:49,321 --> 00:56:53,121
It had to happen then because women
in general were taking a stand.

680
00:56:53,361 --> 00:56:56,401
There was the new women's movement,
Alice Schwarzer,

681
00:56:56,641 --> 00:56:58,841
one thing enabled the other.

682
00:56:59,081 --> 00:57:04,321
Things were happening inside and outside
of parliament, "pollinating" each other.

683
00:57:06,761 --> 00:57:10,001
<i>Stand your ground, don't give in</i>

684
00:57:10,241 --> 00:57:13,361
<i>You have got this far</i>

685
00:57:13,601 --> 00:57:17,121
<i>Don't budge, don't let them win</i>

686
00:57:17,321 --> 00:57:20,241
<i>Stay true to who you are</i>

687
00:57:20,801 --> 00:57:23,641
<i>Under the pavement</i>

688
00:57:24,601 --> 00:57:26,721
<i>There lies a beach</i>

689
00:57:28,641 --> 00:57:33,241
<i>Reach out your hand
and grab a stone from the sand</i>

690
00:57:39,201 --> 00:57:42,441
<i>Don't let anyone tell you</i>

691
00:57:43,161 --> 00:57:46,281
<i>What you should or should not do</i>

692
00:57:46,521 --> 00:57:49,761
<i>You get to have your say</i>

693
00:57:50,161 --> 00:57:53,201
<i>And do things just your way</i>

694
00:57:53,641 --> 00:57:55,801
<i>Under the pavement</i>

695
00:57:57,641 --> 00:57:59,521
<i>There lies a beach</i>

696
00:58:00,921 --> 00:58:06,601
<i>Reach out your hand
and grab a stone from the sand</i>

697
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:10,481
<i>Dance and give a twirl</i>

698
00:58:12,081 --> 00:58:15,121
<i>You'll never be "their girl"</i>

699
00:58:15,801 --> 00:58:17,601
<i>Scare them away</i>

700
00:58:19,361 --> 00:58:22,681
<i>Laugh loud, now hear me say:</i>
Your turn!

701
00:58:22,961 --> 00:58:26,081
Even old hands
at the party conference circuit

702
00:58:26,361 --> 00:58:29,281
cannot recall seeing as many women

703
00:58:29,521 --> 00:58:33,481
at other events of this kind
as there were at the CDU conference

704
00:58:33,721 --> 00:58:35,681
in Essen's Grugahalle.

705
00:58:35,921 --> 00:58:38,841
Heiner Geißler's vision
of transforming the CDU

706
00:58:39,081 --> 00:58:44,001
into an advocate of a "new partnership",
as the Secretary General calls it,

707
00:58:44,601 --> 00:58:47,921
made the mood at the CDU event
at the heart of the Ruhr Valley

708
00:58:48,121 --> 00:58:53,121
more amicable, and more importantly,
showed that it was looking to the future.

709
00:58:53,401 --> 00:58:57,001
The party wants to achieve
equality between men and women

710
00:58:57,201 --> 00:59:01,081
in everyday life by the year 2000.

711
00:59:01,281 --> 00:59:02,921
An ambitious goal.

712
00:59:03,121 --> 00:59:06,441
In the run-up to this conference,
Heiner Geissler announced

713
00:59:06,721 --> 00:59:10,961
that he would give up his post as
Minister for Family Affairs afterwards

714
00:59:11,201 --> 00:59:16,521
so that he could devote himself
to his duties as General Secretary.

715
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:21,361
So I said to the <i>Frauenunion</i>: "Ladies,
the time has finally come to demand

716
00:59:21,601 --> 00:59:25,401
the appointment
of a second woman in the cabinet.

717
00:59:25,641 --> 00:59:30,081
Kohl can forget his conference in
Essen if he doesn't pledge to do that."

718
00:59:30,361 --> 00:59:33,401
I assume the CDU doesn't want
to look utterly ridiculous

719
00:59:33,641 --> 00:59:36,441
and will appoint a
second female minister.

720
00:59:36,681 --> 00:59:39,761
I believe that it should
be at least three or four.

721
00:59:40,001 --> 00:59:44,081
The number of CDU female ministers
should at least correspond

722
00:59:44,361 --> 00:59:48,521
to the number of female party members,
considering the party's goals.

723
00:59:48,761 --> 00:59:50,321
This is nothing new,

724
00:59:50,561 --> 00:59:53,681
you know the numbers,
I think it's 21 percent.

725
00:59:53,921 --> 00:59:56,561
- I think we may have to…
- May I comment on that?

726
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:59,561
- In a minute.
- You keep going off topic.

727
00:59:59,801 --> 01:00:02,201
No, I'll finish my point if I may.

728
01:00:02,481 --> 01:00:06,121
So we'll have to make do
with a second token woman.

729
01:00:06,361 --> 01:00:08,721
And then the ladies replied,

730
01:00:08,961 --> 01:00:13,281
"But then he won't choose one of us.
He'll be really annoyed with us."

731
01:00:13,561 --> 01:00:17,321
And I said, "Well, if you're
too scared, I'll do it on my own."

732
01:00:17,561 --> 01:00:21,201
And it got a lot of
coverage in the press:

733
01:00:21,881 --> 01:00:24,561
"Helmut Kohl
can forget his party conference

734
01:00:24,801 --> 01:00:28,121
if he doesn't pledge to appoint
a second female minister."

735
01:00:28,401 --> 01:00:32,521
And then he informed me,
but not directly, of course:

736
01:00:32,761 --> 01:00:37,081
I shouldn't get any ideas into my head. I
was not going to be the second minister.

737
01:00:37,361 --> 01:00:39,601
Just look at how events unfolded.

738
01:00:39,841 --> 01:00:43,561
Before the conference, after
publication of their principles,

739
01:00:43,801 --> 01:00:49,361
a female politician stuck her neck out
and said, "How about a second minister?"

740
01:00:49,801 --> 01:00:52,801
From then on, it was all negotiated
behind closed doors.

741
01:00:53,041 --> 01:00:55,121
No woman dared say another word.

742
01:00:55,401 --> 01:01:00,001
A very high-profile, capable female
politician said to me, and I quote:

743
01:01:00,201 --> 01:01:03,921
"Oh, we don't want to discuss that,
because we know our Helmut Kohl.

744
01:01:04,121 --> 01:01:07,481
If we mention it again, he'll be so
mad we won't get a second seat."

745
01:01:07,761 --> 01:01:11,881
- Oh no, that's just not true.
- It is! There but for the grace of Kohl.

746
01:01:12,241 --> 01:01:14,721
Kohl said to Schäuble and Geissler:

747
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:17,641
"I'm not that stupid:
I won't do an Edward Heath

748
01:01:17,881 --> 01:01:20,081
and let a Thatcher on board."

749
01:01:20,841 --> 01:01:23,881
That really amused me
when I heard about that.

750
01:01:24,121 --> 01:01:27,081
But at the party conference,
he had to announce

751
01:01:27,321 --> 01:01:32,521
that a second woman would join the
cabinet and that woman was Rita Süssmuth.

752
01:01:42,041 --> 01:01:46,641
<i>There she is: Professor Rita
Süssmuth, Heiner Geißler's successor.</i>

753
01:01:47,761 --> 01:01:50,601
<i>Up to now, she worked
in social education in Dortmund.</i>

754
01:01:50,841 --> 01:01:54,241
<i>The 48-year-old will become
the new Minister of Family Affairs</i>

755
01:01:54,521 --> 01:01:56,001
<i>in mid-September.</i>

756
01:01:56,201 --> 01:01:59,561
<i>Her appointment
came as a big surprise to many.</i>

757
01:01:59,801 --> 01:02:03,721
You're also said to be very loyal,
but does this loyalty go so far

758
01:02:04,081 --> 01:02:07,561
as to considering yourself
a "transitional" minister?

759
01:02:08,721 --> 01:02:12,761
Well, I am loyal
if the situation and the people

760
01:02:13,441 --> 01:02:15,841
require it and make it possible.

761
01:02:16,081 --> 01:02:20,481
What's really important to me is that
each person is true to themselves.

762
01:02:20,761 --> 01:02:22,321
I am who I am.

763
01:02:22,561 --> 01:02:26,241
My predecessor was a different
person with his own identity.

764
01:02:26,521 --> 01:02:29,161
Very self-assured,
aren't you, Professor?

765
01:02:29,401 --> 01:02:34,001
A number of female MPs in the
CDU and CSU will not be pleased.

766
01:02:34,201 --> 01:02:37,241
Yes, it's true,
we were rather offended

767
01:02:37,481 --> 01:02:40,081
when Rita Süssmuth turned up.

768
01:02:42,441 --> 01:02:46,841
You see, the Union
had been in opposition for so long.

769
01:02:47,081 --> 01:02:51,761
There was no way to move up the ranks,
and the women just ploughed on and on.

770
01:02:53,801 --> 01:02:57,081
I did find it very difficult
at the beginning.

771
01:02:57,361 --> 01:03:02,641
They didn't rate my chances much
in the papers:

772
01:03:02,881 --> 01:03:04,681
"She'll be gone in six months."

773
01:03:04,921 --> 01:03:06,321
I must admit

774
01:03:06,601 --> 01:03:11,401
that this particularly
spurred me on to say:

775
01:03:11,641 --> 01:03:13,601
"That's not what I want.

776
01:03:13,841 --> 01:03:17,121
If I take on this challenge,
I'm going to stick it out."

777
01:03:17,721 --> 01:03:20,641
Rita Süssmuth
didn't have a political background.

778
01:03:20,881 --> 01:03:24,121
She was a woman
with traditional values,

779
01:03:24,401 --> 01:03:27,001
but she was actually
way ahead of her time.

780
01:03:27,201 --> 01:03:30,441
She'd be a good fit
for Angela Merkel's CDU today.

781
01:03:30,681 --> 01:03:35,081
Back then, she was a pure white raven
surrounded by a sea of CDU black.

782
01:03:35,321 --> 01:03:38,121
And they'd got her on board

783
01:03:38,321 --> 01:03:42,201
to give the impression that
they were equipped for the future,

784
01:03:42,441 --> 01:03:45,281
also because of the emerging
women's movement

785
01:03:45,521 --> 01:03:47,921
and the Green Party
women in parliament.

786
01:03:48,121 --> 01:03:51,921
And then she was confronted
with the HIV crisis

787
01:03:52,121 --> 01:03:54,641
and took a completely
unorthodox approach.

788
01:03:54,881 --> 01:03:57,841
Very effective, but very
controversial within her party.

789
01:03:58,081 --> 01:04:01,601
<i>After fierce clashes with Bavaria,
the minister pushed through</i>

790
01:04:01,841 --> 01:04:05,681
<i>her policy of fighting AIDS with
a comprehensive awareness campaign</i>

791
01:04:05,921 --> 01:04:08,401
<i>and counselling,
rather than tough new laws.</i>

792
01:04:15,281 --> 01:04:18,601
Tina, how much are these condoms?

793
01:04:22,081 --> 01:04:26,721
We're not talking about showing
understanding for the homosexual scene.

794
01:04:26,961 --> 01:04:31,041
What is essential here is to make it
clear that this is <i>contra naturam,</i>

795
01:04:31,281 --> 01:04:35,281
which means "against nature", and
is fundamentally deviant behaviour.

796
01:04:35,521 --> 01:04:39,601
We finally have to make protection
of the majority in our society

797
01:04:39,841 --> 01:04:43,761
our top priority
and stop concerning ourselves with

798
01:04:44,001 --> 01:04:46,801
how we can better understand
the margins of society.

799
01:04:47,041 --> 01:04:51,001
We have to make these margins
thinner. We have to thin them out.

800
01:04:51,241 --> 01:04:56,041
We must make it clear to our young people
that this does not offer them a future.

801
01:04:56,561 --> 01:05:01,361
It highlighted all the things
that were still taboo in society:

802
01:05:02,041 --> 01:05:04,041
homosexuals,

803
01:05:04,281 --> 01:05:09,641
who were painted as the villains
spreading AIDS all across our country.

804
01:05:10,201 --> 01:05:12,281
And taking a stand against that

805
01:05:12,521 --> 01:05:18,281
naturally meant that I was often at
odds with the official party line.

806
01:05:18,521 --> 01:05:22,521
At some point, it was common
knowledge that she and Helmut Kohl

807
01:05:22,761 --> 01:05:24,761
had become adversaries.

808
01:05:25,001 --> 01:05:29,601
He was absolutely furious that she
was so different to how he'd imagined

809
01:05:29,841 --> 01:05:33,601
and she was pretty shocked
by the macho posturing,

810
01:05:33,841 --> 01:05:37,801
not only in the case of Kohl,
but in this milieu in general.

811
01:05:38,041 --> 01:05:41,081
<i>Rita Süssmuth on the way
to announcing her candidacy</i>

812
01:05:41,361 --> 01:05:43,641
<i>for the office of
Bundestag President.</i>

813
01:05:43,881 --> 01:05:47,161
<i>She had become a nuisance
to the powers that be in Bonn,</i>

814
01:05:47,441 --> 01:05:51,681
<i>who "promoted her out of the way" into
the second-highest office of state.</i>

815
01:05:52,601 --> 01:05:54,961
We were all outraged.

816
01:05:55,681 --> 01:05:58,081
And we all quickly tried

817
01:05:58,321 --> 01:06:00,841
to get various proposals

818
01:06:01,041 --> 01:06:05,481
off the ground in a way
that would allow them to survive

819
01:06:05,761 --> 01:06:09,361
when she wasn't there anymore
to hold her protective hand

820
01:06:09,601 --> 01:06:12,001
over certain important projects.

821
01:06:12,441 --> 01:06:14,681
If I am elected to this office,

822
01:06:14,921 --> 01:06:18,321
I will remain Rita Süssmuth
and an active politician.

823
01:06:18,601 --> 01:06:22,201
I have no intention
of turning my back on politics.

824
01:06:22,441 --> 01:06:24,761
I really wanted to
remain a minister

825
01:06:26,881 --> 01:06:30,961
and I came out of the meeting
and wasn't one anymore.

826
01:06:33,041 --> 01:06:35,161
For my team,

827
01:06:35,441 --> 01:06:37,361
for our team and for me,

828
01:06:37,601 --> 01:06:42,321
that was a really sad moment,
and I thought I was powerless.

829
01:06:42,561 --> 01:06:46,241
She also made something
of the job of Bundestag President.

830
01:06:46,481 --> 01:06:50,641
Because you can use the office
in very different ways.

831
01:06:50,881 --> 01:06:54,881
And she really did a lot
to advance women's issues.

832
01:06:55,121 --> 01:06:58,201
Whatever the topic,
she never failed to address

833
01:06:58,481 --> 01:07:01,361
sensitive points
and take people to task.

834
01:07:01,601 --> 01:07:06,481
Of course, at first people thought,
"Now she's quiet. We've silenced her."

835
01:07:06,721 --> 01:07:11,561
But she knew that they hoped this
and she didn't give in.

836
01:07:11,881 --> 01:07:14,401
<i>Rita Süssmuth caused
quite a sensation</i>

837
01:07:14,641 --> 01:07:17,921
<i>at the party conference
in Bremen in September 1989,</i>

838
01:07:18,121 --> 01:07:21,201
<i>when she joined Lothar Späth
and Heiner Geißler</i>

839
01:07:21,481 --> 01:07:24,481
<i>in an unsuccessful attempt
to oust the chancellor.</i>

840
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:29,521
What would have become of the CDU
as a party of the people,

841
01:07:29,761 --> 01:07:34,161
if we hadn't had the women's
party conference in Essen,

842
01:07:34,441 --> 01:07:39,281
and as a result of this… and I
say this after some consideration…

843
01:07:39,521 --> 01:07:43,121
we didn't now have the most
politically significant, popular

844
01:07:43,361 --> 01:07:48,121
and respected woman in our midst,
namely, Rita Süssmuth.

845
01:07:48,321 --> 01:07:50,081
Where would we be then?

846
01:08:05,441 --> 01:08:09,481
He'd probably had a different image
of me: the good Catholic woman.

847
01:08:12,281 --> 01:08:14,241
One of our own.

848
01:08:14,961 --> 01:08:17,481
And that wasn't me.

849
01:08:19,241 --> 01:08:23,361
I would never have been able
to stay true to myself

850
01:08:23,601 --> 01:08:26,241
if I'd fit that image.

851
01:09:22,561 --> 01:09:29,361
PETRA AND HANNELORE

852
01:09:47,841 --> 01:09:49,091
Oh, lovely.

853
01:09:49,321 --> 01:09:51,481
The air is the best here.

854
01:10:38,921 --> 01:10:43,081
I've noticed that
you're rather fond of boots.

855
01:10:44,441 --> 01:10:50,001
And I know that you've worn through a
pair or two in the service of the party.

856
01:10:50,201 --> 01:10:55,201
It goes without saying that these boots
are black in line with party colours…

857
01:11:01,641 --> 01:11:04,121
And above all they're
meant to help you

858
01:11:04,321 --> 01:11:07,241
to fight the next few
election campaigns

859
01:11:07,481 --> 01:11:09,481
at your husband's side.

860
01:11:26,161 --> 01:11:28,641
<i>Petra Kelly carries her own bags.</i>

861
01:11:28,841 --> 01:11:32,041
<i>She doesn't deserve pity,
yet some men in the Greens look on</i>

862
01:11:32,281 --> 01:11:35,001
<i>as this woman slaves away
until she drops.</i>

863
01:11:35,201 --> 01:11:37,561
<i>After all, "she is emancipated",</i>

864
01:11:37,801 --> 01:11:40,961
<i>meaning: she alone
is responsible for her actions.</i>

865
01:11:42,201 --> 01:11:44,321
THE INTERVIEW CHALLENGE

866
01:11:49,081 --> 01:11:52,401
Like many women, ma'am,
you suffer from living

867
01:11:52,681 --> 01:11:55,481
- in your husband's shadow.
- So you always claim!

868
01:11:57,801 --> 01:11:59,961
But doesn't it bother you

869
01:12:00,201 --> 01:12:03,281
to be a silent, albeit attractive
figure on the margins?

870
01:12:03,521 --> 01:12:07,121
You're claiming I'm silent again,
but you're not there all the time.

871
01:12:07,361 --> 01:12:10,201
I accompanied a lot of
Helmut Kohl's state visits.

872
01:12:10,441 --> 01:12:15,721
She really shone on trips abroad, with
her fluent English and fluent French,

873
01:12:15,961 --> 01:12:18,441
which wasn't the case
with Chancellor Kohl.

874
01:12:18,881 --> 01:12:21,721
I got a real glimpse
into this marriage,

875
01:12:21,961 --> 01:12:24,921
but it never occurred to me
to write or talk about it.

876
01:12:25,161 --> 01:12:28,881
I didn't even talk to
my husband about it.

877
01:12:29,361 --> 01:12:33,081
A lot of people
really underestimated this woman.

878
01:12:33,481 --> 01:12:35,721
You also talked about bringing

879
01:12:35,961 --> 01:12:38,241
more tenderness to politics.

880
01:12:38,521 --> 01:12:41,601
Should politicians start hugging
or even kissing each other?

881
01:12:41,841 --> 01:12:46,361
That wouldn't be so bad, but they already
do that enough, albeit in a formal way.

882
01:12:46,601 --> 01:12:50,201
No, tenderness in politics means
that it should be for the people,

883
01:12:50,441 --> 01:12:54,121
it's about loving your neighbour,
and tenderness also means

884
01:12:54,361 --> 01:12:59,241
being careful about how you protect the
integrity of what's important to you.

885
01:12:59,481 --> 01:13:03,761
Politics also requires a certain
caution if it strives to be ecological.

886
01:13:04,001 --> 01:13:06,761
Tenderness means
trying to understand each other,

887
01:13:07,001 --> 01:13:10,481
deconstructing our image of the
enemy, both out there and within.

888
01:13:28,241 --> 01:13:30,961
We've finally made
it into the Bundestag!

889
01:13:34,961 --> 01:13:38,121
I see Petra Kelly
as the first global politician.

890
01:13:38,401 --> 01:13:44,121
She really valued people's
rights to self-determination:

891
01:13:44,321 --> 01:13:47,121
Aborigines, Native Americans,

892
01:13:47,361 --> 01:13:50,681
and also the Black Power Movement.

893
01:13:50,921 --> 01:13:53,921
She was a real role model
and got sacks full of post.

894
01:13:54,201 --> 01:13:59,001
Mr Beuys, it's not easy
to describe Petra Kelly,

895
01:13:59,201 --> 01:14:02,841
such a multi-faceted character,
and so dedicated.

896
01:14:03,041 --> 01:14:06,561
What would you say:
is she a little work of art?

897
01:14:06,801 --> 01:14:09,881
If she is a work of art,
I'd say she's a big one.

898
01:14:10,161 --> 01:14:14,601
A large, important and powerful
work of art within the movement.

899
01:14:15,681 --> 01:14:18,521
And, of course,
above all she's a human being,

900
01:14:18,761 --> 01:14:24,041
and her way of being comes across
in such an uninhibited fashion,

901
01:14:24,281 --> 01:14:25,881
with full force.

902
01:14:26,081 --> 01:14:29,721
This force can't be brought
to a halt, it can't be stopped.

903
01:14:29,961 --> 01:14:32,721
A lot of people
want Petra to finally stop,

904
01:14:32,961 --> 01:14:35,481
but she's unstoppable,
thank God.

905
01:14:36,161 --> 01:14:40,241
In spite of all his talents,
your husband is sometimes accused

906
01:14:40,641 --> 01:14:42,721
of being provincial at heart.

907
01:14:42,961 --> 01:14:47,321
- And this verdict rubs off on his wife.
- Ah, I see.

908
01:14:47,721 --> 01:14:50,241
Does it offend you
when someone says,

909
01:14:50,481 --> 01:14:55,481
"There is something rather
provincial about that Mrs Kohl"?

910
01:14:55,721 --> 01:14:57,841
We all have to come from somewhere.

911
01:14:58,081 --> 01:15:00,841
Provincialism
is a tricky question in my case.

912
01:15:01,081 --> 01:15:04,241
In the introduction,
you said I'd moved 17 times.

913
01:15:04,521 --> 01:15:07,001
You were wrong. It was 19 times.

914
01:15:07,201 --> 01:15:10,681
So which province are we
talking about? You tell me.

915
01:15:10,881 --> 01:15:13,841
Well, we could list
all of the 17 or 19 places…

916
01:15:14,081 --> 01:15:16,721
- But you know what I mean.
- Of course.

917
01:15:16,961 --> 01:15:19,881
I know you're trying
to wiggle your way out of it.

918
01:15:20,161 --> 01:15:22,961
So you don't think
you're provincial?

919
01:15:23,161 --> 01:15:28,441
You want to hear my personal opinion
on whether I'm provincial? Just say so.

920
01:15:28,681 --> 01:15:29,931
- No.
- No.

921
01:15:30,081 --> 01:15:31,721
- Period?
- End of story.

922
01:15:33,321 --> 01:15:37,881
Ms Kelly, you just said that the
movement had a strength all of its own

923
01:15:38,081 --> 01:15:40,721
and it had nothing
to do with the media.

924
01:15:40,961 --> 01:15:44,441
I heard you speak for the
first time today and I must say

925
01:15:44,681 --> 01:15:47,841
it has a whole lot
to do with the media.

926
01:15:48,081 --> 01:15:50,441
The media
have painted such a picture of you,

927
01:15:50,721 --> 01:15:53,281
I wondered who on
earth would turn up!

928
01:15:53,601 --> 01:15:56,921
And then you gave a speech
like that. Good heavens!

929
01:15:57,961 --> 01:16:00,521
She kind of lost her effect
in parliament.

930
01:16:00,761 --> 01:16:03,721
It was a bit like seeing a deer

931
01:16:03,961 --> 01:16:07,081
who had been chased into that room.

932
01:16:07,321 --> 01:16:10,121
Suddenly, all the magic was gone.

933
01:16:10,321 --> 01:16:12,401
She really lost her impact

934
01:16:12,641 --> 01:16:17,321
and the conservative politicians
seized the chance to ridicule her.

935
01:16:17,561 --> 01:16:21,801
Since I've been in Bonn, I've become
more and more hostile towards men.

936
01:16:22,841 --> 01:16:27,281
I'm talking from my own experience: for
the first time I've lost my confidence

937
01:16:27,561 --> 01:16:30,881
and everything that gave me courage
to speak in public

938
01:16:31,161 --> 01:16:32,721
in the Bundestag.

939
01:16:32,921 --> 01:16:37,841
I get this tremendous fear and anxiety
if I have to speak in the Bundestag.

940
01:16:38,721 --> 01:16:43,561
I'm concerned because I can see that
she's wearing herself out unnecessarily,

941
01:16:43,801 --> 01:16:49,081
that she's giving too much of herself
and letting herself be ripped to shreds.

942
01:16:49,401 --> 01:16:53,241
And of course I'm also worried
that she'll be exploited.

943
01:16:53,481 --> 01:16:56,961
That's the big danger for anyone
who becomes a prominent figure.

944
01:16:57,201 --> 01:17:02,561
Yes, let's face it: the standards
are set by some actress or other.

945
01:17:02,801 --> 01:17:06,641
Who have been coached
and styled for a particular role

946
01:17:06,881 --> 01:17:08,761
and they have their lines.

947
01:17:09,001 --> 01:17:13,041
And if they don't manage it,
they repeat it thirty times over.

948
01:17:13,841 --> 01:17:15,641
And then it's great.

949
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:18,241
People like me stand here at 8 p.m.

950
01:17:18,521 --> 01:17:21,561
after five interviews
and various other activities,

951
01:17:21,801 --> 01:17:24,561
in "freefall", as it were,
and have to ad-lib.

952
01:17:33,641 --> 01:17:36,201
<i>The lives of the former Green MPs</i>

953
01:17:36,441 --> 01:17:39,721
<i>Petra Kelly and Gerd Bastian
ended in tragedy.</i>

954
01:17:40,161 --> 01:17:43,401
<i>This afternoon, investigators
announced the cause of death:</i>

955
01:17:43,641 --> 01:17:48,641
<i>The former Bundeswehr general
firstly shot his 44-year-old partner.</i>

956
01:17:48,881 --> 01:17:51,081
<i>Bastian then committed suicide.</i>

957
01:17:51,361 --> 01:17:54,361
<i>The reasons behind his actions
are still unclear.</i>

958
01:17:59,761 --> 01:18:04,321
Maybe Gert Bastian thought that if he
couldn't be there to look after her,

959
01:18:04,561 --> 01:18:06,321
she'd just fall apart.

960
01:18:06,561 --> 01:18:09,441
That was a major
error of judgement.

961
01:18:09,681 --> 01:18:12,801
And a patriarchal,
protective judgement, too.

962
01:18:13,041 --> 01:18:18,441
Maybe Petra Kelly would have
got burnout, as we call it today,

963
01:18:18,721 --> 01:18:22,761
maybe she'd have disappeared for
years, having treatment somewhere,

964
01:18:23,001 --> 01:18:26,641
but I'm a hundred percent certain
that Petra…

965
01:18:28,001 --> 01:18:31,561
if she'd had the
chance to grow old,

966
01:18:31,801 --> 01:18:34,681
she'd have had a second shot.

967
01:18:42,321 --> 01:18:46,521
<i>Hannelore Kohl, the wife of the
former federal chancellor, is dead.</i>

968
01:18:46,761 --> 01:18:50,401
<i>She took her life in her house
in Ludwigshafen-Oggersheim.</i>

969
01:18:50,641 --> 01:18:54,201
<i>In farewell letters to family and
friends she explained her motives:</i>

970
01:18:54,441 --> 01:18:57,081
<i>she had a serious illness,
an allergy to light.</i>

971
01:18:57,281 --> 01:19:00,601
<i>The illness had left her
barely able to leave the house.</i>

972
01:19:02,721 --> 01:19:06,321
After her funeral,
Bernhard Vogel told me

973
01:19:06,561 --> 01:19:10,041
that he'd gone to visit Hannelore,

974
01:19:10,241 --> 01:19:14,641
and he'd arranged
to go out and eat with her.

975
01:19:14,881 --> 01:19:18,121
And Hannelore
was wearing a white silk blouse,

976
01:19:18,401 --> 01:19:21,081
which kind of draped
over her hands,

977
01:19:21,281 --> 01:19:24,121
with these wide sleeves.

978
01:19:24,601 --> 01:19:29,281
And he could see
these dark blotches on her skin,

979
01:19:29,521 --> 01:19:31,041
wet blotches.

980
01:19:31,241 --> 01:19:35,041
And when Hannelore
noticed he was looking at them,

981
01:19:35,241 --> 01:19:39,401
she pulled her sleeve back
and you could see red, raw skin.

982
01:19:39,961 --> 01:19:41,961
And then Bernhard Vogel said,

983
01:19:42,201 --> 01:19:46,561
"A person can't carry
on living like that.

984
01:19:46,801 --> 01:19:49,481
That was the
moment I realised this."

985
01:20:09,161 --> 01:20:11,081
DAD

986
01:20:11,281 --> 01:20:14,481
Otto Schily, SPD, will now speak.

987
01:20:19,641 --> 01:20:22,921
Allow me to add some
personal remarks.

988
01:20:32,441 --> 01:20:34,321
My uncle Fritz Schily,

989
01:20:35,721 --> 01:20:40,441
a sincere and honest man,
was a colonel in the <i>Luftwaffe.</i>

990
01:20:45,081 --> 01:20:49,001
Towards the end of the war, he was…

991
01:21:07,561 --> 01:21:09,241
I'm sorry.

992
01:21:13,241 --> 01:21:15,641
9 MAY 1945

993
01:21:16,881 --> 01:21:21,841
<i>Today we bring you the last
Wehrmacht report of this war.</i>

994
01:21:22,081 --> 01:21:26,041
<i>Since midnight the weapons
on all fronts are silent.</i>

995
01:21:27,241 --> 01:21:29,521
<i>By the order of the Grand Admiral,</i>

996
01:21:29,761 --> 01:21:33,321
<i>the Wehrmacht
ceased its hopeless fighting.</i>

997
01:21:34,681 --> 01:21:39,241
<i>With this, a nearly six-year
heroic struggle has ended.</i>

998
01:21:40,241 --> 01:21:44,801
<i>It brought us great victories,
but also heavy defeats.</i>

999
01:21:45,801 --> 01:21:48,401
<i>The German Wehrmacht</i>

1000
01:21:48,641 --> 01:21:52,601
<i>has been honourably defeated
by superior forces.</i>

1001
01:21:53,321 --> 01:21:56,441
<i>There will now be a
three-minute silence.</i>

1002
01:22:00,441 --> 01:22:04,721
After weeks of controversy, the
exhibition is finally opening in Munich:

1003
01:22:04,961 --> 01:22:09,481
"The War of Extermination: the Crimes
of the Wehrmacht from 1941 to 1944".

1004
01:22:09,721 --> 01:22:14,121
Lord Mayor of Munich, Christian
Ude, today accused the CSU

1005
01:22:14,401 --> 01:22:19,241
of fuelling a Neo-Nazi campaign
across Germany against the exhibition.

1006
01:22:19,521 --> 01:22:23,081
In my opinion, this exhibition
is offensive towards my father.

1007
01:22:23,521 --> 01:22:27,561
I believe that it amounts
to incitement of the people,

1008
01:22:28,401 --> 01:22:31,481
slandering the memory
of the deceased.

1009
01:22:32,721 --> 01:22:34,601
- It's not…
- Arsehole!

1010
01:22:38,401 --> 01:22:40,641
- …to show…
- We don't want you here!

1011
01:22:40,881 --> 01:22:44,441
The press are liars!
The press are liars!

1012
01:22:45,321 --> 01:22:49,121
- He's on your side!
- The press are liars!

1013
01:22:49,321 --> 01:22:52,121
I can still remember
how my sister and I

1014
01:22:52,361 --> 01:22:57,081
went to see the exhibition
on the Wehrmacht

1015
01:22:57,281 --> 01:22:59,321
and how anxious we were.

1016
01:22:59,561 --> 01:23:03,481
We didn't talk about it
until we left the exhibition.

1017
01:23:03,721 --> 01:23:06,361
We were both scared
of the same thing:

1018
01:23:06,601 --> 01:23:10,241
it would have been a crazy
coincidence, but we hoped we didn't see

1019
01:23:10,481 --> 01:23:12,401
any photos of our dad.

1020
01:23:13,441 --> 01:23:16,561
We were both
really worried about it

1021
01:23:16,801 --> 01:23:19,361
and I think a lot of people
in our generation

1022
01:23:19,601 --> 01:23:25,121
were worried about seeing their
father or grandfather or brother,

1023
01:23:25,321 --> 01:23:28,801
seeing someone
you didn't want to see there.

1024
01:23:29,161 --> 01:23:33,961
And then it even became
a topic of debate in the Bundestag.

1025
01:23:34,681 --> 01:23:37,921
Everybody knew about it,
but you didn't talk about it.

1026
01:23:38,161 --> 01:23:40,281
It was a really taboo topic.

1027
01:23:40,521 --> 01:23:44,681
Then people starting discussing it
in public and in their families:

1028
01:23:44,921 --> 01:23:47,481
everyone had a story to tell

1029
01:23:47,721 --> 01:23:50,121
and it was like a veil of lead

1030
01:23:50,401 --> 01:23:54,201
which had enveloped
post-war Germany.

1031
01:23:55,601 --> 01:23:59,681
Therefore this is a matter
which affects our relations

1032
01:23:59,921 --> 01:24:02,961
with an entire
generation of this country.

1033
01:24:04,001 --> 01:24:07,201
Whoever attempts,
and attempts are being made,

1034
01:24:07,961 --> 01:24:10,961
to brand an entire
wartime generation

1035
01:24:11,201 --> 01:24:15,121
as members and accomplices
of a criminal organisation,

1036
01:24:15,321 --> 01:24:19,401
they want to strike Germany at its core,
and we will fight back against this.

1037
01:24:19,641 --> 01:24:21,801
Christa Nickels,
the floor is yours.

1038
01:24:23,401 --> 01:24:25,481
President, dear colleagues.

1039
01:24:25,721 --> 01:24:28,761
My mother told me
that in the 1950s, my father…

1040
01:24:29,001 --> 01:24:32,161
a man toughened by life,
who always worked hard,

1041
01:24:32,441 --> 01:24:34,561
never slept with the window open

1042
01:24:34,801 --> 01:24:38,841
and cried out in his sleep every
night about fire, about children.

1043
01:24:39,081 --> 01:24:41,241
She said it was just awful.

1044
01:24:42,961 --> 01:24:46,841
Of course,
I loved my father a great deal.

1045
01:24:48,161 --> 01:24:51,081
I never heard him
talk about what it was like

1046
01:24:51,281 --> 01:24:54,401
to shoot at another human being
for the first time.

1047
01:24:54,641 --> 01:24:58,401
And then there was that handshake
between our chancellor and Mr Reagan

1048
01:24:58,641 --> 01:25:01,161
at Bitburg cemetery
where SS soldiers are buried.

1049
01:25:01,401 --> 01:25:03,241
For the first time, I realised

1050
01:25:03,481 --> 01:25:06,481
that on the only photo of my father
from this period,

1051
01:25:06,721 --> 01:25:10,561
he's in a black uniform with a
skull and crossbones insignia.

1052
01:25:10,801 --> 01:25:12,841
I was already a Green MP by then.

1053
01:25:13,081 --> 01:25:15,921
I didn't dare ask
my father about it.

1054
01:25:16,641 --> 01:25:19,121
I found it extremely difficult.

1055
01:25:19,321 --> 01:25:22,121
I just didn't have
the heart to do it.

1056
01:25:22,321 --> 01:25:25,881
And then in 1989, with the
Green Party parliamentary group

1057
01:25:26,081 --> 01:25:30,041
I went to Warsaw to commemorate 50
years since the invasion of Poland.

1058
01:25:30,281 --> 01:25:32,081
We went to Majdanek.

1059
01:25:32,281 --> 01:25:37,361
And I only know that Dad was in
France, in Russia and in Poland.

1060
01:25:37,601 --> 01:25:40,441
I know that he was
captured in Lviv.

1061
01:25:41,161 --> 01:25:44,761
Then I went to Majdanek concentration
camp and I have to tell you

1062
01:25:44,961 --> 01:25:47,281
I really fell to pieces one night.

1063
01:25:47,561 --> 01:25:50,121
I was absolutely
appalled by the camp,

1064
01:25:50,321 --> 01:25:55,561
but also by how these men had
been exploited, my father included.

1065
01:25:55,801 --> 01:25:59,921
They were mainly men, men
who loved life and their children.

1066
01:26:00,161 --> 01:26:04,241
I was appalled by how these men
had been used in this criminal war.

1067
01:26:04,481 --> 01:26:07,641
They weren't strong enough
to take another path.

1068
01:26:07,881 --> 01:26:10,521
They burdened themselves
with a terrible guilt

1069
01:26:10,761 --> 01:26:13,121
and were too weak
to take another path.

1070
01:26:13,401 --> 01:26:16,081
All of the men and the women
and the children,

1071
01:26:16,281 --> 01:26:19,841
I'm the daughter of
one of those soldiers,

1072
01:26:20,041 --> 01:26:22,081
feel the impact to this day.

1073
01:26:22,321 --> 01:26:27,041
And Mr Dregger, it's not true
that if we show the wounds,

1074
01:26:27,241 --> 01:26:32,001
if we show the unvarnished truth
and start to talk about it,

1075
01:26:32,841 --> 01:26:37,241
we're dragging the people involved
through the mud or badmouthing them.

1076
01:26:37,521 --> 01:26:41,361
On the contrary,
the best thing that could happen

1077
01:26:41,601 --> 01:26:46,361
would be to create a climate in Germany
where the elderly fathers and mothers,

1078
01:26:46,601 --> 01:26:50,121
and the children,
some older than others, I'm 45 now…

1079
01:26:50,321 --> 01:26:53,361
could come together
and have a calm conversation

1080
01:26:53,601 --> 01:26:55,721
about what happened to them.

1081
01:26:55,961 --> 01:26:59,281
I wanted to say that and I must
admit I'm impressed by the debate.

1082
01:26:59,561 --> 01:27:04,161
I thought long and hard about speaking
up because of course people kept saying:

1083
01:27:04,401 --> 01:27:06,681
"How could you?
He was your father."

1084
01:27:06,921 --> 01:27:10,481
But I'm not tarnishing the family
name because anyone who knows me

1085
01:27:10,721 --> 01:27:14,081
knows how much I love and loved
my parents, my father included.

1086
01:27:14,361 --> 01:27:18,121
And if this debate has helped
in any way to change things

1087
01:27:18,321 --> 01:27:23,281
it's because we've started to present
our political ideas and our own stories

1088
01:27:23,521 --> 01:27:27,921
in an honest, unvarnished way,
using simple yet horrific images.

1089
01:27:28,161 --> 01:27:31,521
That's what I hope for, and I
believe this Wehrmacht exhibition

1090
01:27:31,761 --> 01:27:34,921
may be able
to set precisely this in motion,

1091
01:27:35,161 --> 01:27:40,241
unless we start to plaster over the
wounds and give people false consolation,

1092
01:27:40,481 --> 01:27:42,441
stones instead of bread,

1093
01:27:42,681 --> 01:27:46,241
if today, we say to the
people who were involved:

1094
01:27:46,481 --> 01:27:49,681
"It shouldn't hurt you anymore
because you had no choice."

1095
01:27:49,921 --> 01:27:52,201
That doesn't help at all.
Thank you.

1096
01:28:41,681 --> 01:28:45,601
MRS CHANCELLOR

1097
01:28:45,841 --> 01:28:48,681
Are women simply too modest
in politics?

1098
01:28:48,921 --> 01:28:53,841
They say they're not after a majority,
although more women vote than men.

1099
01:28:54,081 --> 01:28:58,841
But then to think you could be as strong
or stronger in the various parliaments,

1100
01:28:59,081 --> 01:29:02,161
that we could have
a female state minister-president,

1101
01:29:02,441 --> 01:29:05,401
a female party leader
or even a female chancellor?

1102
01:29:05,721 --> 01:29:10,281
It wouldn't have been possible. You
have to keep your feet on the ground.

1103
01:29:11,441 --> 01:29:15,641
A female chancellor in the
1970s and 80s was unthinkable.

1104
01:29:15,881 --> 01:29:18,681
You couldn't jump up and say,
"Here I am!"

1105
01:29:18,921 --> 01:29:22,321
Even if you'd been blessed
with every talent imaginable,

1106
01:29:22,601 --> 01:29:25,561
it wouldn't have made a difference.

1107
01:29:25,801 --> 01:29:29,521
If the choice had been between the
most talented woman of the 1970s

1108
01:29:29,761 --> 01:29:33,281
and some dumb male clown,
the clown would have got the job.

1109
01:29:34,201 --> 01:29:36,201
No question about that.

1110
01:29:36,561 --> 01:29:40,361
I always dreamed of being
chancellor, if I'm really honest.

1111
01:29:40,601 --> 01:29:43,321
And someone else backed me too.

1112
01:29:43,561 --> 01:29:46,601
There's an old
interview in the <i>Spiegel</i>

1113
01:29:46,841 --> 01:29:50,361
where Franz-Josef Strauß says which
woman he'd choose as chancellor

1114
01:29:50,601 --> 01:29:52,641
and it was Renate Hellwig.

1115
01:29:52,881 --> 01:29:56,521
Of course, that was a
red flag for Helmut Kohl.

1116
01:29:57,401 --> 01:30:01,281
But Strauß didn't do it to please
you, he did it to annoy Helmut Kohl.

1117
01:30:01,521 --> 01:30:03,721
- Yes, but…
- No, no.

1118
01:30:03,961 --> 01:30:07,041
All the same,
I was the only candidate!

1119
01:30:07,321 --> 01:30:10,641
I did run for the post
of Young Democrat Chairwoman.

1120
01:30:10,881 --> 01:30:13,201
We know.
Did you want to be chancellor?

1121
01:30:13,481 --> 01:30:14,841
Well, I…

1122
01:30:15,801 --> 01:30:18,521
- You'd have been excellent.
- Great, maybe so.

1123
01:30:18,761 --> 01:30:21,561
On the other hand,

1124
01:30:21,801 --> 01:30:27,681
chancellors always have
this extreme desire,

1125
01:30:27,921 --> 01:30:32,081
this absolute need to gain power
and they will stop at nothing.

1126
01:30:32,361 --> 01:30:37,921
I observed this and I partly
admired it and partly feared it.

1127
01:30:38,161 --> 01:30:40,441
But I never wanted to be like that.

1128
01:30:40,681 --> 01:30:44,201
If I could have become chancellor
without all that, then maybe.

1129
01:30:44,481 --> 01:30:46,601
And why can't you say,
"Absolutely!

1130
01:30:46,841 --> 01:30:49,801
Theoretically speaking,
I would have done it."

1131
01:30:51,161 --> 01:30:53,161
No, I can't!

1132
01:30:53,401 --> 01:30:56,161
Do you seriously
think that my party

1133
01:30:56,401 --> 01:31:00,601
would accept Mrs Merkel's offer
of talks under these circumstances

1134
01:31:00,841 --> 01:31:03,761
when she says
she wants to become chancellor.

1135
01:31:04,001 --> 01:31:06,521
Let's not get too carried away now!

1136
01:31:06,761 --> 01:31:11,721
The German voters sent out a clear signal
as far as the chancellor candidate goes.

1137
01:31:12,521 --> 01:31:17,401
"I swear that I will dedicate my efforts
to the well-being of the German people

1138
01:31:17,641 --> 01:31:21,361
promote their welfare,
protect them from harm,

1139
01:31:22,081 --> 01:31:26,281
uphold and defend the Basic Law
and the laws of the Federation,

1140
01:31:26,561 --> 01:31:29,241
perform my duties conscientiously,

1141
01:31:29,481 --> 01:31:32,321
and do justice to all.

1142
01:31:32,921 --> 01:31:35,201
So help me God."

1143
01:31:36,161 --> 01:31:38,881
Sometimes history
makes you lose hope.

1144
01:31:39,081 --> 01:31:43,641
But sometimes it also makes you want
to let out a little whoop of joy.

1145
01:31:43,881 --> 01:31:45,681
I mean…

1146
01:31:46,921 --> 01:31:50,881
of course I can't support everything
Angela Merkel does politically.

1147
01:31:51,161 --> 01:31:54,161
But what I find really wonderful

1148
01:31:54,401 --> 01:31:59,121
is how she became chancellor and
how long she's stayed chancellor.

1149
01:31:59,521 --> 01:32:03,441
At any rate, she's very
adept at dealing with power.

1150
01:32:03,681 --> 01:32:06,881
The way she fends off
her older and younger rivals

1151
01:32:07,161 --> 01:32:10,481
with a flick of the wrist…
it's certainly impressive.

1152
01:32:10,721 --> 01:32:15,361
"You must fight tooth and nail, but
make it appear smooth and effortless."

1153
01:32:15,601 --> 01:32:20,321
I learned this lesson, too, and I know
that "fight" isn't the right word…

1154
01:32:20,561 --> 01:32:23,041
in the context of the
women's movement

1155
01:32:23,241 --> 01:32:26,081
and certainly not
for male-female relations,

1156
01:32:26,281 --> 01:32:28,881
but it is the right approach.

1157
01:32:51,561 --> 01:32:53,681
In 1908 women weren't even allowed

1158
01:32:53,921 --> 01:32:57,841
to attend political events or
meetings of political associations.

1159
01:32:58,081 --> 01:33:00,081
In 1918 they first got the vote.

1160
01:33:00,361 --> 01:33:02,721
Then it was taken away again.

1161
01:33:03,881 --> 01:33:07,281
They "manned up" during the war,

1162
01:33:07,561 --> 01:33:12,761
but then let themselves
be driven back into the kitchen,

1163
01:33:13,281 --> 01:33:17,161
making space for the men
who had returned from the war.

1164
01:33:17,401 --> 01:33:20,281
These things take time, you know,

1165
01:33:20,521 --> 01:33:23,041
because it's a battle,
a battle for power.

1166
01:33:23,241 --> 01:33:26,161
Each position
which is occupied by a woman

1167
01:33:26,401 --> 01:33:29,881
won't be occupied by a man anymore,
so they have something to lose.

1168
01:33:30,081 --> 01:33:33,081
So we have to make it clear
that it's not really a loss.

1169
01:33:33,361 --> 01:33:36,241
Maybe it's better
if men and women join forces.

1170
01:33:36,481 --> 01:33:39,161
But implanting this awareness

1171
01:33:39,401 --> 01:33:41,641
in people's minds,

1172
01:33:42,721 --> 01:33:44,721
that's difficult.

1173
01:33:44,961 --> 01:33:48,441
But maybe we'll manage it
over the next 25 years.

1174
01:33:53,601 --> 01:33:55,201
I think we will.

1175
01:34:12,641 --> 01:34:14,161
Are we all ready?

1176
01:34:36,361 --> 01:34:38,441
Well… we're done.

1177
01:34:57,201 --> 01:34:59,681
"Ladies, if we do nothing today,

1178
01:34:59,881 --> 01:35:03,001
we will live tomorrow
as we did yesterday."

1179
01:35:03,241 --> 01:35:07,041
Unfortunately, this appeal
by Annemirl Bauer from 1988

1180
01:35:07,241 --> 01:35:09,481
still rings true today.

1181
01:35:09,721 --> 01:35:11,761
For the first time in 20 years,

1182
01:35:12,001 --> 01:35:15,681
the share of women in the Bundestag
has fallen to just 30.7 percent.

1183
01:35:15,921 --> 01:35:19,561
Women are still paid less than men,
are less likely to be promoted

1184
01:35:19,801 --> 01:35:22,761
and carry the greatest burden
in family life.

1185
01:35:23,001 --> 01:35:26,521
Populists would like to send women
back to the kitchen and nursery

1186
01:35:26,761 --> 01:35:30,601
and the Internet is rife with hate
against dedicated female politicians.

1187
01:35:30,841 --> 01:35:33,881
What former Health Minister
Käte Strobel once said

1188
01:35:34,161 --> 01:35:36,041
is as relevant today as ever:

1189
01:35:36,241 --> 01:35:43,161
"Politics is far too serious a matter
to be left in the hands of men alone!"
