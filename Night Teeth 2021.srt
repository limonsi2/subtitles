[intense music playing]

4
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:14,250
[female voice] We're all around you.

5
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:18,583
Living right under your noses…

6
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:22,083
and you have no idea.

7
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:26,625
Things were a lot simpler in the old days.

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,208
We hunted you,

9
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:31,750
and you hunted us.

10
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:34,625
In Los Angeles,

11
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:39,250
no one fought harder
than a place called Boyle Heights.

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,791
So, we struck up a truce

13
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:47,041
to maintain the peace
between our kind and yours.

14
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:48,916
We lived in secret,

15
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:52,625
and you convinced yourselves
you had never really believed.

16
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:54,208
You forgot to be afraid.

17
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:58,958
You made books and movies about us
and got most of the details wrong,

18
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,125
while we became richer

19
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:03,958
and more powerful
than you could ever imagine.

20
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:08,125
To this day, there are some
who still uphold the truce,

21
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:09,333
who keep our secret.

22
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:11,958
As long as we stick to the three rules.

23
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:15,041
Don't let humans know we exist,

24
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:17,291
don't feed on the unwilling,

25
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:22,708
and never ever enter Boyle Heights
without permission.

-[Jay] I got distracted.

34
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:57,625
[woman] How sorry?

35
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:59,291
I'll-make-it-up-to-you sorry.

36
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:01,541
Oh, you'll-make-it-up-to-me kind of sorry.

37
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:02,958
How are you gonna do that?

Nah, you look nice.

[Jay] A dead man.

50
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,833
[woman] Put the gun back.
We cannot do this.

51
00:02:57,416 --> 00:03:01,875

Hey, uh, B-plus, 60 bucks.

77
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,875
Thank you, sir.
You're a lifesaver, you know that?

78
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,875
You're saving my ass with this paper, bro.

79
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,666
We're gonna check out
this club downtown, Three Kings?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Hey, what's up, slick?
You got that kit for me?

91

Step one, finish this track.
Two, set up the label.

Three, world domination. It's simple.

Hey, Grandma.

104
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,250
[Grandma] You came at a good time.

105
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,041
[Benny in English] Yeah? Why's that?

106
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:10,500
[Grandma in Spanish] I just took out
some flautitas and some empanadas.

107
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:11,833
[Benny in English] Nice!

108
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,333
[Grandma in Spanish] Are you hungry?

109
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:16,208
[Benny in English] You know it.
[in Spanish] But why do I bother shopping

110
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,250
if you're never
going to cook me a sancoche?

111
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:20,916
You know I don't cook that.

112
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:24,416
You know that one of these days
I'm going to buy you a house.

113
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:28,166
[groans] I don't need
my own home, my love.

114
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,291
What I do need is for you
to finish your studies

115
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,250
so you can take care of yourself.

116
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,833
[in English] Because someday
I'm gonna die, and so will you.

117
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:39,041
Ay, Ma, why you gotta talk like that?
So negative. I don't like it.

118
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,083
[in Spanish] Well, that's life, son.

[Jay, muffled] Bro, you told me
you could handle it.

124
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,750
No, I told you. This is--

125
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,666
Come on, Jessie,
you're really gonna do me like that?

126
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,875
I need someone to cover the car tonight.

127
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:18,708
It's about Maria.

128
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,791
Yeah, well, I thought I could rely on you!

129
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,291
Yeah, fine, whatever.

130
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,291
Why are you creeping?

131
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,291
If I'd know you was coming through,
I would've rolled out the red carpet.

132
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,833
I have to pick up some things,
check in on Grandma.

133
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,791
-Check in on your punk ass.
-Ha.

134
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:43,125
Oh, wait a minute. What's this?
Bro, that some gray hairs on your head?

135
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,208
Hey, I'm serious.
You're getting old, papi.

136
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,375
-Just wait. It's gonna happen to you too.
-[laughs]

137
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:51,125
I don't know if you're working tonight,
but maybe we could go to Mario's,

138
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,833
grab a pizza, watch the game.

139
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,333
[Jay] I got something else tonight.

140
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,500
All right,
then who's covering the car, then?

141
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,750
[Jay] I had to cancel.
Everyone's booked up.

142
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,166
All right, but you see,
I was thinking, like, what if,

143
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,291
you see, what if I take the car? Right?

144
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,083
-'Cause I could use the money.
-No way.

145
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,125
-Why not?
-[Jay] One, you're a bad driver.

146
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,333
Bad… That's bullshit.

147
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,166
When was the last time
you were west of K-Town?

148
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,791
Hey, Jay, my man, look,
I am way more responsible

149
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,000
than all them dudes
you got out there at the depot.

150
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:18,291
Yeah, except them dudes at the depot,
they got chauffeur's license,

151
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:21,041
they're insured by the company,
and they actually own a suit.

152
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:25,875
I… You see, the thing is, though,
Jay, I got a suit. I got a suit, Jay.

00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:26,916
[scoffs]

154
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:30,083
What, you and Maria been fighting?
That's what it is?

00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,875
You having some relationship issues?

156
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:35,041
If you want to talk to me,
you can talk to me.

157
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,208
I give great advice.
That's what people be saying.

158
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,791
-[Jay] Yeah, right.
-[chuckles]

-What's this thing you gotta do tonight?
-I said don't worry about it.

165
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:05,875
All right. Fine, man.
I didn't even… [mumbles]

166
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:08,333
-[sighs]
-[Benny] So secretive, man.

167

-[Jay] Hey, Benny.
-[keys jingle]

168
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,791
Scratch it, I'll kill you.

00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,083
Yo. You serious?

170
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,916
Man! I'm gonna need me one of these.

171
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,208
You can't afford it.

172
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,875
Well, I'mma flip my beats,

00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,500
[in deep voice] Yeah, man, I'm fine.
I'm living my best life.

514
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:56,333
Are you crazy? Is he…

515
00:29:57,375 --> 00:29:59,666
-Is he--
-He's dead. Yes, Daniel.

516
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,125
Yes, he's dead.

517
00:30:02,208 --> 00:30:03,291
I killed him.

518
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:05,041
-No, you can't do this.
-[Zoé] No?

519
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:07,833
We're protected. This place is protected!

520
00:30:07,916 --> 00:30:11,791
You're protected?
How protected do you feel right now?

521
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:13,750
Hmm? [laughs]

522
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:16,041
Blaire, finish your drink.
We're running behind schedule.

523
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:19,791
-Hey. You stupid bitches.
-[Zoé] Mmm.

524
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:23,000
They're gonna come after you for this.
The bosses will burn you alive.

525
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:24,083
-Oh.
-[Daniel] Yeah.

526
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:26,791
-You can't kill in here. It's off-limits.
-[laughs]

527
00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:28,208
Oh, are those the rules?

528
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,958
You can't. You're gonna ruin this place.

529
00:30:31,041 --> 00:30:33,750
Well, that's the point.
No more happy endings.

530
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,416
-[clangs]
-No, wait, hey!

531
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,708
Wait, no, no, no. Don't, please, wait.

532
00:30:37,791 --> 00:30:40,583
You can't kill me.
You can't. What about the truce?

533
00:30:40,666 --> 00:30:44,041
-The truce is dead, handsome.
-Wait. Wait. [groans]

534
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:47,666
[Blaire slurping]

535
00:30:50,166 --> 00:30:51,458
[panting]

536
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:04,583
Hey, uh, officer, listen. Um, I…

537
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:07,291
I need… I need your help. I… I got this…

538
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:09,291
It's an emergency.
There's these two women, right?

539
00:31:09,375 --> 00:31:10,958
-And they're after me and--
-Two women?

540
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:12,333
-Mm-hmm.
-After you?

541
00:31:12,416 --> 00:31:16,291
Yeah, I've been… I've been driving them
around all night, but I think that's--

542
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,250
Is there anything
you want to tell me about, son?

543
00:31:18,333 --> 00:31:21,791
-No, listen, I'm trying--
-How much have you had to drink tonight?

544
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:23,333
-I haven't drank anything.
-Any drugs?

545
00:31:23,416 --> 00:31:24,541
-No drugs.
-Weapons on you?

546
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:27,250
Listen, there's
this secret floor in there, okay?

547
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:29,541
There's this crazy shit
that's going on in there.

548
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:32,458
I need you to call backup.
I need you to call everyone, call--

549
00:31:32,541 --> 00:31:34,000
Exactly what'd you see up there?

550
00:31:34,083 --> 00:31:35,333
[panting]

551
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:39,708
They killed these two guys, all right?
They were drinking their blood, man.

552
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:42,125
Okay, that's enough.
Put your hands behind your back.

553
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:44,000
Put your hands behind your back!

554
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:44,916
Hey!

555
00:31:47,916 --> 00:31:50,125
Come on. Take… take me to jail right now.

556
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:52,041
Get me… get me out of here. [grunts]

557
00:31:52,541 --> 00:31:53,500
Mm-hmm. Let's go.

558
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:56,375
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no.

559
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:59,000
-What happens upstairs stays upstairs.
-No. Okay.

560
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,583
-You should know better.
-Yeah, I'm not gonna say--

561
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:04,625
-Get in the trunk. In the trunk!
-I won't say nothing!

562
00:32:04,708 --> 00:32:08,250
-I'm not gonna say anything!
-Excuse me, Officer Anderson.

563
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:14,291
You girls.

564
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:16,250
Yes, us girls.

565
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,833
This kid is saying
you killed two men upstairs.

566
00:32:21,916 --> 00:32:24,041
-That can't be right, right?
-[Blaire] Of course not.

567
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:26,583
Benny here has no idea what he saw.

568
00:32:26,666 --> 00:32:27,625
Do you, Benny?

569
00:32:28,208 --> 00:32:31,375
We just gave those boys
the best suck they're ever gonna get.

570
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:34,000
Let him go. He's ours.

571
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:35,125
[chuckles]

572
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:37,333
Yeah. Victor know about this?

573
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:38,958
What do you think, dipshit?

574
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:42,250
We're just making our collections.
Business as usual.

575
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:45,416
-Well, I didn't get a call.
-Oh, you didn't get a call?

576
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,333
Maybe you're not important enough
to get a call.

577
00:32:47,416 --> 00:32:50,000
Yeah, maybe I should just call Victor now.

578
00:32:50,083 --> 00:32:51,625
[Zoé] Why don't you do that?

579
00:32:51,708 --> 00:32:56,750
I'm sure Victor would love to hear
from his favorite little piggy.

580
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,583
[Blaire] Hand him over.

581
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:04,083
[exhales]

582
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:06,833
Okay, all right. Fine.

583
00:33:08,125 --> 00:33:09,166
[keys jingle]

584
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:13,375
[handcuffs click]

585
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,125
[Zoé] Go turn the car around.

586
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:21,666
Huh? Hey!

587
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:25,291
No more funny games.

588
00:33:36,625 --> 00:33:38,625
[ominous music playing]

589
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:47,875
-[clicks]
-[liquid pouring]

590
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,625
[mechanical whirring]

591
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:16,250
[phone camera clicks]

592
00:34:24,666 --> 00:34:29,458
[muffled] Wait! No.
Don't go! Wait! Don't leave!

593
00:34:29,541 --> 00:34:31,125
[engine revving]

594
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:34,125
[sinister music playing]

595
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,500
[Zoé and Blaire laughing]

596
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,833
Yeah.

597
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,291
-Yeah, you count this out?
-[both laugh]

598
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:10,541
[speaking indistinctly]

599
00:35:13,916 --> 00:35:15,041
[gulps]

600
00:35:16,041 --> 00:35:17,458
[panting]

601
00:35:17,541 --> 00:35:19,000
[heart beating]

602
00:35:19,791 --> 00:35:20,875
[clicks]

603
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:24,000
[heart beating rapidly]

604
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:27,916
[grunts]

605
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:38,041
Back in the car, driver.

606
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:40,541
[Benny] Hmm.

607
00:35:45,458 --> 00:35:47,458
[intense music playing]

608
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:07,666
[engine revving]

609
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:08,958
[music continues]

610
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:16,375
[somber melody playing]

611
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:27,125
Don't get up. I know where the bar is.

612
00:36:27,208 --> 00:36:30,375
-What the hell are you doing here?
-I'm having a drink with my bosses, Eva.

613
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:35,000
Better make it a good one.

614
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:40,708
-It's gonna be your last.
-[Victor] I'll keep that in mind.

615
00:36:41,291 --> 00:36:44,666
We told you what would happen
if you stepped foot in Boyle Heights,

616
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:47,000
and yet, here you are,

617
00:36:47,083 --> 00:36:48,541
being reckless as ever.

618
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:49,833
Drinking blood cocktails

619
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,250
on white upholstery,
and I'm the reckless one?

620
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:56,291
[Eva] You need to remember your place,
Victor. You're middle management.

621
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:59,416
Give me one reason
why I shouldn't call Martin right now.

622
00:37:01,541 --> 00:37:05,125
-Because I've had a change of heart.
-What heart?

623
00:37:06,333 --> 00:37:07,583
I deserve that.

624
00:37:20,958 --> 00:37:22,958
This view never gets old.

625
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:26,458
Yeah. But now we're gonna have to ruin it
with your dead body.

626
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:30,750
I should have let her do
what she wanted with you.

627
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:33,916
I wanted to barbecue you
the moment you fed outside the lines.

628
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,708
But Grace said that would be impulsive.

629
00:37:36,791 --> 00:37:39,458
I think the word I used was tacky.

630
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:41,625
Well, I'm glad you didn't.

631
00:37:42,125 --> 00:37:45,458
I know you've never trusted me,
never given me any real power.

632
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:48,166
But if you hadn't tried
to run me out of my own city,

633
00:37:48,791 --> 00:37:50,666
I wouldn't be seeing so clearly now.

634
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:53,250
-Are you on something?
-You violated the truce.

635
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:56,208
It's the one thing that's kept
our kind safe all these years,

636
00:37:56,291 --> 00:37:58,416
and you just pissed on it.

637
00:38:02,458 --> 00:38:06,666
For years we've been told
who to feed on and where

638
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:09,291
and treating humans
like they're our equals.

639
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:11,541
It started to feel like a prison.

640
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:15,625
So I got frustrated
and did something impulsive.

641
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:18,250
Should we say

642
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:21,000
tacky?

643
00:38:21,083 --> 00:38:22,000
[Eva] Tacky?

644
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:26,500
You fed where you weren't supposed to
and started a war with Jay Perez.

645
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:29,875
If he comes for us,
Boyle Heights will follow.

646
00:38:29,958 --> 00:38:33,083
Do you like your fancy clothes
and your concrete mansion?

647
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:38,166
Because if we get exposed,
that all goes away. For all of us.

648
00:38:39,166 --> 00:38:40,125
I know.

649
00:38:40,916 --> 00:38:42,833
I put you two in a terrible position.

650
00:38:44,041 --> 00:38:46,208
Do you think that I don't get frustrated?

651
00:38:46,916 --> 00:38:51,208
Do you think that when my pool boy
leaves a leaf in the pool,

652
00:38:51,291 --> 00:38:54,958
that I don't wanna string him upside down
and suck him dry?

653
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:59,625
But if I pitch a fit every time
somebody pisses me off,

654
00:38:59,708 --> 00:39:00,791
what does that make me?

655
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:01,958
A man.

656
00:39:02,041 --> 00:39:03,250
Stupid as shit.

657
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:04,333
Like I said.

658
00:39:06,666 --> 00:39:07,625
I'm sorry.

659
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:11,125
No, a ban is a ban.

660
00:39:11,208 --> 00:39:14,208
You're gonna have to do a lot better
than that if you want me to reverse it.

661
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,208
You know, forever is a very long time.

662
00:39:18,875 --> 00:39:21,458
Give it 40, 50 years.

663
00:39:21,541 --> 00:39:25,000
Who knows? Maybe this will blow over,
and you'll be able to come back.

664
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:28,708
[sighs] Oh, I think you've misunderstood.

665
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:31,083
I'm not going anywhere.

666
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:35,666
In fact, my girls
are down there right now,

667
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:39,958
ripping your entire network apart
one neck at a time.

668
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:45,083
So, everything you see belongs to me.

669
00:39:46,291 --> 00:39:48,250
After I kill both of you, of course.

670
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:50,750
-Martin!
-[feedback squeals]

671
00:39:50,833 --> 00:39:54,333
I, uh, think you might
have to speak up a little.

672
00:39:57,708 --> 00:39:59,083
[laughs]

673
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:03,875
[Benny mumbling]
This is not real. This is…

674
00:40:03,958 --> 00:40:06,458
Come on. She's here, then she's there.

675
00:40:06,541 --> 00:40:07,625
[muttering]

676
00:40:12,708 --> 00:40:14,625
-You need to calm down.
-Calm? Be calm?

677
00:40:14,708 --> 00:40:16,166
-You want me to calm down?
-Yeah.

678
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,916
-I'm calm.
-Oh, you're calm?

679
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,125
-Yeah. This is me calm.
-This is you calm?

680
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:22,708
-You seem kind of worked up.
-What do you want me to do, huh?

681

01:07:31,833 --> 01:07:34,750
I don't know. I'm getting worried.

1192
01:07:35,541 --> 01:07:37,750
This night's going sideways.

1193
01:07:37,833 --> 01:07:40,083
We can't stop now. We're nearly done.

1194
01:07:41,208 --> 01:07:43,916
I'm gonna drain the kid.
I'm gonna smother the grandma,

1195
01:07:44,541 --> 01:07:46,166
and we can hit Venice tomorrow.

1196
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:49,708
[Victor] We need to clear Venice tonight.
Rocko is too unpredictable.

1197
01:07:49,791 --> 01:07:52,416
If we mess this up,
there will be no tomorrow.

1198
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:54,750
-[man grunting]
-Venice is the last kill.

1199
01:07:54,833 --> 01:07:56,791
-[man whimpering]
-I know you can do it.

1200
01:07:56,875 --> 01:07:59,625
Just keep a hold of the kid,
and we'll party at dawn.

1201
01:08:01,083 --> 01:08:02,541
The world will be ours, babe,

1202
01:08:03,125 --> 01:08:04,375
just me and you.

1203
01:08:05,166 --> 01:08:07,958
[breathes deeply]

1204
01:08:08,041 --> 01:08:08,875
Yeah.

1205
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:11,541
Let's get it done.

1206
01:08:12,041 --> 01:08:13,166
Now,

1207
01:08:14,833 --> 01:08:15,916
where were we?

1208
01:08:26,875 --> 01:08:28,458
[whispering] It's kind of cool.

1209
01:08:29,083 --> 01:08:30,000
[knife clatters]

1210
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:34,250
Huh.

1211
01:08:36,875 --> 01:08:37,791
All right.

1212
01:08:39,333 --> 01:08:41,333
[hip-hop music playing on speakers]

1213
01:08:52,333 --> 01:08:53,791
This is super cool.

1214
01:08:54,291 --> 01:08:56,333
[chuckles] Yeah, all right.

1215
01:08:56,416 --> 01:08:58,041
You… you can put that down.

1216
01:08:58,958 --> 01:09:00,041
[sighs] Sorry.

1217
01:09:00,125 --> 01:09:02,500
This is all just leftover
from when I was a kid.

1218
01:09:02,583 --> 01:09:06,333
I was gonna get rid of all of this stuff.
I haven't really had the time to upgrade--

1219
01:09:06,416 --> 01:09:08,416
Yes. Did you build all of this?

1220
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:12,666
Yeah, but you know,
can we just maybe turn this down--

1221
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:14,791
Mm-mm. No.

1222
01:09:16,125 --> 01:09:17,291
Why not?

1223
01:09:17,375 --> 01:09:18,458
'Cause I like it.

1224
01:09:19,541 --> 01:09:20,833
I think it's really good.

1225
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:26,333
I mean, I'm assuming
B's Session Number Three, that's you?

1226
01:09:26,958 --> 01:09:30,250
Oh yeah. You know,
this is actually… it's a… it's a classic.

1227
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:31,458
Oh, this is a classic?

1228
01:09:31,541 --> 01:09:33,375
Oh yeah, yeah. Everyone says so.

1229
01:09:33,458 --> 01:09:35,041
-[Blaire] Oh, everyone says so?
-Mm-hmm.

1230
01:09:35,125 --> 01:09:36,500
People, like who?

1231
01:09:37,208 --> 01:09:40,125
You know, people like… my grandma?

1232
01:09:40,208 --> 01:09:42,458
-Yeah. [laughs]
-[Benny laughs]

1233
01:09:42,541 --> 01:09:45,500
So, when are you gonna play this
for other people?

1234
01:09:46,291 --> 01:09:50,833
Well, I'm planning on it. I… I want
to do something… something with this.

1235
01:09:50,916 --> 01:09:53,791
It's more than fun.
I wanna turn it into something real.

1236
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:56,458
And when I do, you know,

1237
01:09:56,541 --> 01:09:59,875
then you could tell people
that you're my first fan.

1238
01:09:59,958 --> 01:10:02,458
-So, in a way, you're welcome.
-Oh, I can?

1239
01:10:02,541 --> 01:10:04,500
Yeah, you know, if you want.

1240
01:10:04,583 --> 01:10:06,583
Well, I mean, for what it's worth,

1241
01:10:07,333 --> 01:10:10,041
I believe you. It's really good.

1242
01:10:10,541 --> 01:10:12,041
You're really talented.

1243
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:14,458
[inhales] And you're a very good driver.

1244
01:10:14,541 --> 01:10:16,666
-[laughs] Thanks.
-[Blaire] Mmm.

1245
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:17,750
[chuckles]

1246
01:10:18,875 --> 01:10:20,750
Well, what… what about you?

1247
01:10:22,041 --> 01:10:23,125
What about me? [chuckles]

1248
01:10:23,208 --> 01:10:26,791
You know, is there anything that you like?
Anything you're passionate about?

1249
01:10:28,125 --> 01:10:31,500
I mean, like, in a past life.

1250
01:10:32,458 --> 01:10:33,375
[inhales deeply]

1251
01:10:33,458 --> 01:10:36,708
Zoé and I are always talking
about, like, the shit we're gonna do.

1252
01:10:36,791 --> 01:10:39,250
-You know?
-When did you two meet?

1253
01:10:39,333 --> 01:10:41,291
Um… [laughs]

1254
01:10:41,375 --> 01:10:44,875
She had this place
in Laurel Canyon in the '70s,

1255
01:10:44,958 --> 01:10:46,708
and she would throw these parties.

1256
01:10:46,791 --> 01:10:49,125
So, they would go
for like three or four days.

1257
01:10:49,208 --> 01:10:51,291
Everyone was there. And she loved Bowie,

1258
01:10:51,375 --> 01:10:54,083
so she had this, like…
the Bowie haircut, you know.

1259
01:10:54,166 --> 01:10:56,375
She was cool, man.
The queen bitch, that was her.

1260
01:10:56,458 --> 01:10:58,166
-[chuckles]
-Yeah, that checks out.

1261
01:10:58,250 --> 01:11:02,791
And I was, like, just like a stray
when I first moved here,

1262
01:11:02,875 --> 01:11:06,500
and I didn't feel like I fit anywhere.

1263
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:08,916
And it was like she saw me.

1264
01:11:10,125 --> 01:11:14,125
She told me everything could be beautiful.

1265
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:15,625
[chuckles softly]

1266
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:18,166
She said a bunch of stuff.

1267
01:11:19,416 --> 01:11:22,333
And then she turned me,

1268
01:11:23,375 --> 01:11:25,000
and she gave me this life.

1269
01:11:29,333 --> 01:11:30,583
[inhales deeply]

1270
01:11:31,333 --> 01:11:34,041
Honestly, you should take this
to a producer.

1271
01:11:34,125 --> 01:11:36,125
-[Benny] Yeah.
-[Blaire] You could make real money.

1272
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:39,333
[Benny] I know, I know, it's just
I don't think it's where it has to be yet.

1273
01:11:39,416 --> 01:11:41,166
Where does it have to be?
What's it missing?

1274
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:43,458
It's missing a little something
before it becomes like a--

1275
01:11:43,541 --> 01:11:45,250
-Like, what? A classic?
-Yeah.

1276
01:11:45,333 --> 01:11:46,750
-Mmm.
-Yeah, a classic.

1277
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,041
[Zoé clears throat] We need to leave.

1278
01:11:55,916 --> 01:11:57,416
Yeah. Cool.

1279
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:02,625
Hi.

1280
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:06,583
We're done with Benny, right?
He can stay here.

1281
01:12:06,666 --> 01:12:07,833
I don't think so.

1282
01:12:08,958 --> 01:12:12,583
-Well, this has nothing to do with him.
-He's coming. That's how it's gotta be.

1283
01:12:14,083 --> 01:12:15,500
Why are you being like this?

1284
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,875
Do you want to be the one to tell Victor?

1285
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Hey.

1286
01:12:26,208 --> 01:12:27,416
I'm coming with you.

1287
01:12:28,791 --> 01:12:29,708
Good.

1288
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
[Benny] Let's go.

1289
01:12:35,083 --> 01:12:36,875
[Jay] Anything happens to me,

1290
01:12:37,875 --> 01:12:39,250
you take care of Benny.

1291
01:12:40,625 --> 01:12:41,958
You protect him.

1292
01:12:43,083 --> 01:12:44,333
[man] Consider it done.

1293
01:12:44,416 --> 01:12:46,416
[intense music playing]

1294
01:13:01,041 --> 01:13:01,958
[Jay] Where's Benny?

1295
01:13:03,708 --> 01:13:07,416
-[cutlery clinks]
-Jay. So glad you could make it.

1296
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:09,833
You put a hand on him or Maria,
I swear to God--

1297
01:13:09,916 --> 01:13:12,833
Is that her name? We'll get to her.

1298
01:13:13,375 --> 01:13:14,875
But first, sit.

1299
01:13:14,958 --> 01:13:16,875
-Where are they?
-Sit.

1300
01:13:23,125 --> 01:13:24,916
It's funny to think, though.

1301
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,958
Almost a hundred years ago,

1302
01:13:27,833 --> 01:13:30,875
my kind sat across from your kind,

1303
01:13:30,958 --> 01:13:32,916
much like you and I right now.

1304
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,458
And then they came up with that truce.

1305
01:13:36,083 --> 01:13:38,291
[Jay] Well, you broke that truce.

1306
01:13:38,791 --> 01:13:41,000
You took people from my neighborhood.

1307
01:13:41,666 --> 01:13:42,750
Innocent people.

1308
01:13:43,458 --> 01:13:45,541
Did you think we were gonna let
you get away with that?

1309
01:13:45,625 --> 01:13:49,333
We? Who's this "we" you're talking about?

1310
01:13:50,083 --> 01:13:53,333
Everyone's gone. I had them all killed.

1311
01:13:54,291 --> 01:13:58,416
You should have taken my offer.
Now it's all going to be mine.

1312
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:02,166
You see, you're the last piece.

1313
01:14:03,291 --> 01:14:07,458
Once you're gone,
this city's just one fat neck

1314
01:14:08,458 --> 01:14:09,958
waiting to get sucked.

1315
01:14:10,916 --> 01:14:11,875
You want me?

1316
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:15,250
Fine. Fair game.

1317
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,375
Maria and Benny
have nothing to do with this.

1318
01:14:19,416 --> 01:14:20,458
Let them go.

1319
01:14:21,791 --> 01:14:25,458
That's not how this is going to go.
Nobody walks.

1320
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:27,791
You know that.

1321
01:14:29,583 --> 01:14:30,708

1322
01:14:31,541 --> 01:14:33,375

[Jay panting]

1325
01:14:40,291 --> 01:14:41,916
-Do you want some?
-[grunts]

1326
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:43,791
I saved her for you.

1327
01:14:44,416 --> 01:14:45,708
Your sweet Maria.

1328
01:14:45,791 --> 01:14:46,625
What?

1329
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:48,958
I saved her for you, Jay.

1330
01:14:50,125 --> 01:14:52,916
-[laughs]
-No. No.

1331
01:14:53,583 --> 01:14:55,583
Don't go soft on me now.

1332
01:14:56,291 --> 01:14:58,375
We haven't even gotten started yet.

1333
01:14:58,458 --> 01:14:59,583
[Jay panting]

1334
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,208
[Zoé] Last kill.

1335
01:15:25,875 --> 01:15:27,083
Let's do this.

1336
01:15:32,791 --> 01:15:34,791
[dramatic music playing]

1337
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:44,958
Maybe lean close. This guy's a freak.

1338
01:15:49,458 --> 01:15:51,125
Look what the night dragged in.

1339
01:15:51,916 --> 01:15:53,583
Couple of strays.

1340
01:15:53,666 --> 01:15:56,125
Good morning, Rocko.

1341
01:15:57,083 --> 01:15:58,708
No such thing as a good morning.

1342
01:15:58,791 --> 01:16:00,250
[Zoé] Mmm, maybe not for you.

1343
01:16:04,625 --> 01:16:06,000
I don't know you, do I?

1344
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,708
No, but I'm… I'm with them.

1345
01:16:08,791 --> 01:16:12,000
[chuckles] That doesn't really change
your problem, amigo.

1346
01:16:14,916 --> 01:16:17,875
-I don't know you.
-Don't worry about him. He's cool.

1347
01:16:17,958 --> 01:16:19,291
Yeah, chill, he's with us.

1348
01:16:21,166 --> 01:16:22,125
You cool?

1349
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:28,291
Cool, dude.

1350
01:16:29,416 --> 01:16:30,416
Rough night?

1351
01:16:32,625 --> 01:16:36,166
You look a little, uh, banged up, bro.

1352
01:16:38,166 --> 01:16:40,166
Yeah, I'm… I'm a little banged up, bro.

Oh, I'm just messing with you, man!
I'm goofing!

Mi casa es su casa!

1357
01:16:56,125 --> 01:16:57,708
Enter at your leisure.

1358
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,083
-Madam.
-[Blaire] Mmm.
