it is very annoying.

that I could do most

00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:28,629
Well, yeah, he was better
socially than I was, but...

140
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,415
Well, if you hadn't put me
two years ahead in high school,

141
00:18:32,459 --> 00:18:34,852

the ability to-- to hold

please send me a check.

is that a yes or no?

00:22:48,628 --> 00:22:49,933
[gulping]

185
00:23:11,738 --> 00:23:14,958
[explosive whirring of jets]

186
00:23:27,231 --> 00:23:28,929
[jets passing]

187
00:23:43,944 --> 00:23:46,033
[thunderous roaring of engines]

188
00:23:47,164 --> 00:23:49,340
Fuckin'-- fuckin'...!

189
00:23:51,952 --> 00:23:56,304
Then there was a very
loud sonic boom.

190
00:23:56,347 --> 00:23:57,958
This was the last straw.

191
00:23:58,001 --> 00:24:02,136
And it reduced me to
tears of impotent rage.

192
00:24:03,485 --> 00:24:07,358
But I have a plan for revenge.

193
00:24:08,969 --> 00:24:11,754
[classical music continues]

194
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:24,071
[fire crackling]

195
00:24:28,554 --> 00:24:30,817
[jets roaring in distance]

196
00:24:38,651 --> 00:24:40,914
[dramatic operatic singing]

197
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:10,465
[objects clattering]

198
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,473
[thunder rumbling]

199
00:25:24,784 --> 00:25:26,568
[dog barking in distance]

200
00:25:29,615 --> 00:25:30,920
Shoo! Shoo!

201
00:25:31,486 --> 00:25:32,748
Fuck off.

202
00:25:42,062 --> 00:25:44,412
People say violence
and the taking of human

203
00:25:44,455 --> 00:25:47,241
life is not a way to
resolve human problems.

204
00:25:47,284 --> 00:25:48,547
[sawing]

205
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,852
It can't work.

206
00:25:51,158 --> 00:25:53,160
As a matter of fact,
history shows

207
00:25:53,203 --> 00:25:55,554
that it very often does work.

208
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,948
I want to kill some people.

209
00:25:58,992 --> 00:26:02,604
Preferably a scientist,
a communist, businessman

210
00:26:02,648 --> 00:26:04,345
or some other big shot.

211
00:26:05,781 --> 00:26:08,610
Use shotgun powder
in the last hoping it would

212
00:26:08,654 --> 00:26:10,830
do more
damage than rifle powder.

213
00:26:15,443 --> 00:26:17,140
[explosion bursting]

214
00:26:17,184 --> 00:26:19,665
Spent 350 bucks
on the last bombing mission

215
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:21,536
and barely blew
a finger off.

216
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,407
Absolutely frustrating.

217
00:26:23,451 --> 00:26:25,584
I can't seem
to make a lethal bomb.

218
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:29,805
Seeming increasingly
infeasible without more money.

219
00:26:33,156 --> 00:26:35,245
[machinery rattling]

220
00:26:55,439 --> 00:26:57,354
[high-pitched sawing]

221
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:15,634
[machine rattling]

222
00:27:32,563 --> 00:27:33,826
-Okay?

223
00:27:38,308 --> 00:27:39,614
-There you go.

224
00:27:54,455 --> 00:27:56,239
[vehicle rumbling on]

225
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,077
[vehicle reversing]

226
00:28:36,062 --> 00:28:38,020
Hey, Ted.

227
00:28:38,064 --> 00:28:40,457
You keep drawing like that,
you're gonna cut your nuts off.

228
00:28:40,501 --> 00:28:43,373
-Yeah, I don't take
direction from women

229
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:44,984
on mechanical matters.

230
00:28:45,027 --> 00:28:47,334
Please have your husband
advise me on how to work.

231
00:28:49,162 --> 00:28:50,685
-Fuckin' asshole.

232
00:29:01,261 --> 00:29:03,045
-Yeah, did you... you see that?

233
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:05,047
She tried to fire me,
I'm doing what I'm-- I'm doing

234
00:29:05,091 --> 00:29:06,614
my job,
I'm doing what you told me.

235
00:29:06,657 --> 00:29:08,094
Fucking--

236
00:29:08,137 --> 00:29:09,617
-You know she runs
the show around here?

237
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:12,359
-What?
-She... she runs the show.

238
00:29:13,099 --> 00:29:14,361
Get the fuck out!

239
00:29:14,927 --> 00:29:16,319
[dramatic music]

240
00:29:21,368 --> 00:29:23,413
There is a psycho-surgical

241
00:29:23,457 --> 00:29:26,547
operation that relieves people
who get angry too easily.

242
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,810
They stick electrodes
into your brain and burn out

243
00:29:28,854 --> 00:29:31,987
the gizmo that produces
the emotion of anger.

244
00:29:32,031 --> 00:29:34,511
Of course,
I would rather be miserable

245
00:29:34,555 --> 00:29:37,776
or dead than be relieved
by that humiliating method.

246
00:29:47,524 --> 00:29:49,048
[curtain rustling]

247
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:32,526
[splashing]

248
00:30:50,152 --> 00:30:51,806
[light chatter]

249
00:30:56,376 --> 00:30:58,987
Excuse me.
How much... how much is this?

250
00:30:59,031 --> 00:31:00,336
-25 cents.

251
00:31:05,341 --> 00:31:07,256
-Okay,
I'll think about it.

252
00:31:12,566 --> 00:31:14,655
-Doing some
entertaining there, Ted?

253
00:31:16,831 --> 00:31:18,093
-No.

254
00:31:18,137 --> 00:31:19,442
Just need cutlery.

255
00:31:20,226 --> 00:31:23,272
-Don't have a wife
to chew my food and regurgitate

256
00:31:23,316 --> 00:31:24,970
it into my mouth.
[chuckles awkwardly]

257
00:31:25,796 --> 00:31:27,059
-Fair enough.

258
00:31:38,766 --> 00:31:40,420
Since committing the crimes

259
00:31:40,463 --> 00:31:42,988
reported elsewhere in my notes,
I feel better.

260
00:31:43,031 --> 00:31:45,512
I'm still plenty angry,
you understand,

261
00:31:45,555 --> 00:31:48,471
but the difference is that
I am now able to strike back

262
00:31:48,515 --> 00:31:50,212
to a degree.

263
00:31:51,344 --> 00:31:55,783
True, I can't strike back
to anything like the extent

264
00:31:55,826 --> 00:31:58,481
I wish to, but I no longer
feel totally helpless,

265
00:31:58,525 --> 00:32:01,876
and the anger doesn't
gnaw my guts as it used to.

266
00:32:04,009 --> 00:32:07,186
Guilty feelings? Yes, a little.

267
00:32:07,229 --> 00:32:11,016
Occasionally, I have bad dreams
in which police are after me,

268
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:13,844
or which I am threatened
with punishment

269
00:32:13,888 --> 00:32:17,196
from a supernatural source
such as the devil.

270
00:32:19,154 --> 00:32:21,722
But these don't occur
often enough to be a problem.

271
00:32:23,115 --> 00:32:27,075
I am definitely glad
to have done what I have.

272
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,511
[music fades out]

[coughing]

284
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,571
Here comes a tough one.

285
00:34:55,615 --> 00:34:58,531
So, four numbers.

286
00:34:59,793 --> 00:35:01,751
Keeping the seven
in the same place.

287
00:35:01,795 --> 00:35:03,405
Mm-hmm.

288
00:35:03,449 --> 00:35:05,886
-Create the greatest
and the smallest number

289
00:35:05,929 --> 00:35:08,149
in a combination
of those four digits.

290
00:35:08,193 --> 00:35:10,064
I'm going to give you a hint.

291
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,674
The zero, seven, five,
four is a three-digit number.

292
00:35:12,806 --> 00:35:14,112
Okay?
-Mm-hmm.

293
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:16,636
-Mm-hmm.

294
00:35:17,202 --> 00:35:19,029
Yeah, what's the greatest
and smallest number

295
00:35:19,073 --> 00:35:20,988
for those four digits?

296
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,126
Mm-hmm.

297
00:35:29,518 --> 00:35:30,998
[chuckling softly]

298
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:32,521
Nice. Remarkable.

299
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,090
That's fantastic.

300
00:35:37,004 --> 00:35:40,616
The smallest.
He's really coming along.

301
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,314
He is really smart.

302
00:35:42,357 --> 00:35:44,011
I think you've
probably done enough.

303
00:35:44,054 --> 00:35:47,145
Yeah. All this math
does give me a headache.

304
00:35:47,188 --> 00:35:48,842
-That's what we want.

305
00:35:48,885 --> 00:35:50,626
[all laughing]

306
00:36:28,403 --> 00:36:31,319
In Montana,
if I went to the city to mail

307
00:36:31,363 --> 00:36:34,888
a bomb to some big shot,
the driver would doubtless

308
00:36:34,931 --> 00:36:37,499
remember
I rode the bus that day.

309
00:36:37,543 --> 00:36:41,286
In the anonymity of the big
city, I figured it would be

310
00:36:41,329 --> 00:36:45,290
much safer to buy materials
for a bomb and mail it.

I want to fuck you too, yeah.

00:37:57,057 --> 00:37:59,059

-The psychology of women.

324
00:38:49,936 --> 00:38:52,199
I'm reading, I have work to do.

325
00:38:52,242 --> 00:38:54,419

-No shit.
-Yeah.

329
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,212
Please do not
tell me your troubles.

330
00:39:05,255 --> 00:39:07,562
-[both laughing]
-Right.

331
00:39:09,912 --> 00:39:11,871
What do you...
what do you do for a living?

332
00:39:13,786 --> 00:39:16,571

I gotta go get a job.

Hey.

See, I made a mistake there.

I typed "A"
when I wanted an "S,"

405
00:45:17,323 --> 00:45:19,238

406

I'm always here.

what I'm going to do
is simply personal revenge.

00:46:07,329 --> 00:46:10,942
I do not expect to
accomplish anything it.

427
00:46:10,985 --> 00:46:14,119
Of course, if my crime
and reasons for committing

428
00:46:14,162 --> 00:46:17,339
it gets any public attention,
it may help to stimulate

429
00:46:17,383 --> 00:46:19,907
public interest
in a technology question

430
00:46:19,951 --> 00:46:22,040
and thereby improve
the chances of stopping

431

technology
before it's too late.

432
00:46:24,172 --> 00:46:26,740
But on the other hand,
most people will probably

00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,786
be repelled by my crime.

434
00:46:28,829 --> 00:46:31,658
The opponents of freedom may
use it as a weapon to support

their arguments for control
over human behavior.

00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:37,359
With no way of knowing
whether my action will do

437
00:46:37,403 --> 00:46:40,841
more good than harm,
I certainly don't claim to be

438
00:46:40,885 --> 00:46:43,713
an altruist
or to be acting for the good,

439
00:46:43,757 --> 00:46:45,672
whatever that is,
of the human race.

of days ago, Percy Wood

received a letter from somebody
named Enoch Fisher.

The letter informed
of when to expect a book

in the mail very soon.

465
00:49:39,454 --> 00:49:41,543
But when he got the book
it blew up in his face.

466
00:49:41,587 --> 00:49:44,068
The return address:
3414 West Ravenswood Avenue.

467
00:49:44,111 --> 00:49:45,939
It didn't help much.

468
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,202
It's a vacant lot.
So, police are hoping

469
00:49:48,246 --> 00:49:51,379
for better luck with clues
the explosion left behind.

470
00:49:51,423 --> 00:49:54,643
Today, inside
Wood's home, investigators

471
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:56,471
finished picking up
pieces of the bomb.

472
00:49:56,515 --> 00:49:58,647
That was nerve-wracking.

473
00:49:58,691 --> 00:50:00,345
Metal fragments were scattered
throughout the kitchen and had

474
00:50:00,388 --> 00:50:02,173
to be separated
from bits of glass and paper.

475
00:50:02,216 --> 00:50:04,175
The evidence
recovered from the home

476
00:50:04,218 --> 00:50:07,961
of Mr. Hood-- Mr. Wood was
in good condition and has been

477
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:09,919
dispatched by courier to
the Postal Inspection

478

of the bomb itself

will be analyzed by
the laboratory technicians

482
00:50:20,408 --> 00:50:23,150
and they will
furnish us a full report.

483
00:50:23,194 --> 00:50:25,370
At this time, we are unable

484
00:50:25,413 --> 00:50:28,242
to release any details
on the makeup of the bomb.

485
00:50:29,374 --> 00:50:32,029
We have initiated
an intense investigation

486
00:50:32,072 --> 00:50:34,074
to solve the attack
upon Mr. Wood.

487
00:50:34,118 --> 00:50:36,511
Recently,
Percy Wood outfitted his home

488

with an electronic
security system

489
00:50:38,948 --> 00:50:40,428
and he probably wouldn't
open the front door

490
00:50:40,472 --> 00:50:42,561
if a stranger was outside.

491

though, he opens mail.

When I got
back to camp, I cried.

536

Partly from
frustration of missing,

was happening to the country.

00:56:24,946 --> 00:56:28,689
Even if not find oil, the blast
and helicopters ruin it.

reporting for duty.

544
00:57:27,922 --> 00:57:29,533
-[giggling]
-Hey, there, Ted.

545
00:57:29,576 --> 00:57:31,883
-Hello, Mrs. Hill.
-I'm so glad you're here.

546
00:57:31,926 --> 00:57:33,928
-You ready to work?
-Yes. What can I do?

547
00:57:33,972 --> 00:57:35,539
-Let's head back this way.

548
00:57:37,497 --> 00:57:40,108
I'm gonna put you
in the back with Becky,

549
00:57:40,152 --> 00:57:42,371
and we have
this huge pile of books

550
00:57:42,415 --> 00:57:44,112
that we have to sort through.

551
00:57:44,156 --> 00:57:46,985
Unfortunately, we have
to get rid of all of them.

552
00:57:47,028 --> 00:57:50,945
So I'm gonna have you guys
split them up by genre and...

553
00:58:07,048 --> 00:58:08,572
[sighing]

554
00:58:15,579 --> 00:58:21,541
[soft music]

555
00:58:28,461 --> 00:58:30,245
-Hi.
-Hi.

556
00:58:30,289 --> 00:58:31,943
-I'm Becky.

557
00:58:31,986 --> 00:58:35,337
-I'm-- I'm Ted Kaczynksi.

558
00:58:44,912 --> 00:58:48,307
They should really move
from the Dewey Decimal System

559
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:51,658
to the Library
of Congress system.

560
00:58:52,616 --> 00:58:56,663
I'd suggested it a while back,
but they still haven't, so,

561
00:58:56,707 --> 00:58:59,318
now we have
to do all this again.

562
00:59:09,197 --> 00:59:11,373
[laughing]

563
00:59:11,417 --> 00:59:13,114
Um...

564
00:59:26,606 --> 00:59:27,825
No, we're--

565
00:59:51,283 --> 00:59:53,590
[change falling in payphone]

566
01:00:02,947 --> 01:00:04,601
[whispering] Fuck.

567
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:17,962
Ugh. Goddamn it.

568
01:00:36,328 --> 01:00:38,373
Hi, David, it's me. Yeah.

569
01:00:41,028 --> 01:00:42,856
Yeah, because I was...

570
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:46,686
I was calling to talk to you
and she picked up. And I--

571
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:49,254
Well, I thought... I--

572
01:00:49,297 --> 01:00:50,734
I wanted to speak
to you, not her.

573
01:00:50,777 --> 01:00:52,387
I've never met her.
I thought it was

574
01:00:52,431 --> 01:00:54,389
a bad time to try
to meet her over the phone.

575
01:00:54,433 --> 01:00:56,348
And so I... so I hung up.

576
01:00:56,391 --> 01:00:59,525
Well, can I be trusted to say

577
01:00:59,568 --> 01:01:01,440
the right thing to--
to a woman, David?

578
01:01:01,483 --> 01:01:04,573
Especially Linda,
with the history, and...

579
01:01:04,617 --> 01:01:06,619
Oh my God, is that her
in the background?

580
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:07,925
David, fuck.

581
01:01:11,755 --> 01:01:15,149
Just tell her I apologize
and ask her to leave the room

582
01:01:15,193 --> 01:01:17,064
so I can talk to you
in private, please.

583
01:01:17,108 --> 01:01:19,066
You domesticated yourself.

584
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:21,590
You're like, like,
like a horse that's run

585
01:01:21,634 --> 01:01:24,332
into a farmer's field and...

586
01:01:24,376 --> 01:01:26,247
and volunteered for somebody
to jump on your back

587
01:01:26,291 --> 01:01:28,510
and put a bit in your mouth.

588
01:01:28,554 --> 01:01:31,731
Well, I thought that
we shared a lot of values

589
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:33,733
and I thought that we were on

590
01:01:33,777 --> 01:01:35,735
the same page of
living in the wild.

591
01:01:35,779 --> 01:01:39,696
Now you're living in a zoo like
a caged animal with a trainer.

592
01:01:39,739 --> 01:01:42,481
A trainer who, uh,

593
01:01:42,524 --> 01:01:46,006
who you need
to run everything by. Um...

594
01:01:47,225 --> 01:01:49,140
I'm sure--
oh, I bet you have too.

595
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:50,750
Like if I--
if I asked you-- I was--

596
01:01:50,794 --> 01:01:52,230
I was actually gonna call to ask

597
01:01:52,273 --> 01:01:54,449
for some help,
some financial help.

598
01:01:54,493 --> 01:01:56,147
I just wanted
a little money that I could...

599
01:01:56,190 --> 01:01:58,758
that I could repay.
But I'm sure you have--

600
01:01:58,802 --> 01:02:00,499
Yeah, you would have--

601
01:02:00,542 --> 01:02:02,544
Yes, you would have to ask her,
wouldn't you?

602
01:02:02,588 --> 01:02:04,329
Mm-hmm.

603
01:02:04,372 --> 01:02:06,244
See, that's what I mean.

604
01:02:07,288 --> 01:02:08,812

[tense classical instrumental]

01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:18,218
Hey!

608

[whistling]

609
01:05:39,805 --> 01:05:41,546
Get off my land!

610
01:05:41,589 --> 01:05:43,374
Get off my property.

611
01:05:46,681 --> 01:05:51,773
[shouting indistinctly]

612
01:06:37,950 --> 01:06:39,299
-Ted!

613
01:06:40,387 --> 01:06:42,215
Man in the cabin.

614
01:06:43,434 --> 01:06:44,739
Ted.

615
01:07:03,236 --> 01:07:06,761
-Good morning.
-Morning. Nice day.

616
01:07:07,806 --> 01:07:09,242
Yeah.

617
01:07:09,286 --> 01:07:11,027
-You know, just checking
through the pass

618
01:07:11,070 --> 01:07:12,680
and a little investigation

619
01:07:12,724 --> 01:07:14,726
I was hoping
you could help me with.

620
01:07:14,769 --> 01:07:16,641
You seen anyone, anything,

621
01:07:16,684 --> 01:07:19,122
people, fooling around
with any buildings around here?

622
01:07:19,165 --> 01:07:21,559
-No, only those, uh...

623
01:07:21,602 --> 01:07:24,605
kids who vandalized
that cabin a while back.

624
01:07:24,649 --> 01:07:25,954
Nothing since then.

625
01:07:26,651 --> 01:07:28,609
-Sure.
-You talk to Steve or Tom?

626
01:07:28,653 --> 01:07:31,395
-Yeah, Steve said his mill
got wrecked a while back too.

627
01:07:31,438 --> 01:07:34,006
-Yeah, a while ago. Yeah.

628
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:37,096
-Or, um, motorcyclers,
they hassling you nearby here?

629
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:39,838
-No, nothing like
snowmobile season, anyway, huh?

630
01:07:39,881 --> 01:07:42,406
-Exactly. Right, um...

631
01:07:42,449 --> 01:07:44,234
The reason I had to ask
was we heard you got

632
01:07:44,277 --> 01:07:46,845
pretty upset with some riders
from up the creek.

633
01:07:46,888 --> 01:07:49,195
-Yeah, I did. I did, yeah.

634
01:07:50,414 --> 01:07:53,504
Yes, assholes, though.
A couple of punks tried to--

635
01:07:53,547 --> 01:07:57,943
tried to come across my--
my property and, um...

636
01:07:57,986 --> 01:07:59,249
Yeah.

637
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:03,383
I wouldn't call it anything
out of the ordinary, though,

638
01:08:03,427 --> 01:08:07,387
I imagine if you were
in my position, you would...

639
01:08:09,781 --> 01:08:11,435
You might act the same way.

640
01:08:16,266 --> 01:08:18,964
-Sure. Yeah, that's fair.

641
01:08:19,007 --> 01:08:21,009
I appreciate your time.
If you, uh, hear of anything

642
01:08:21,053 --> 01:08:22,533
you let me know.

643
01:08:22,576 --> 01:08:23,882
-Mm-hm.

644
01:08:53,041 --> 01:08:55,305
-Have a nice day.
-See you, Ted.

-I don't want to
let them get their offer,

because they don't have
credibility with us.

650
01:09:24,725 --> 01:09:27,511
Some think Earth First
is a terrorist organization,

651
01:09:27,554 --> 01:09:29,513
and they've
not renounced violence.

652
01:09:29,556 --> 01:09:32,342
They see a difference
between terrorism and sabotage.

653
01:09:32,385 --> 01:09:34,474
-All kinds of operations,

654
01:09:34,518 --> 01:09:38,652
I've taken a [indistinct],
I've spiked trees,

I've still painted

01:09:41,655 --> 01:09:44,397
-Thank you, David. Thank you.

657
01:09:46,704 --> 01:09:48,140
What a guy.

658
01:09:50,273 --> 01:09:52,623
-...the modern industrial
system as we know it,

659
01:09:52,666 --> 01:09:56,844
and one reason why we see
the modern industrial system

660
01:09:56,888 --> 01:09:59,804
as being so destructive
is because it's

661
01:09:59,847 --> 01:10:01,849
based on the premise
that it is for human beings

662
01:10:01,893 --> 01:10:03,721
that the world exists.

663
01:10:03,764 --> 01:10:06,637
The idea that human beings
are just another species

664
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:10,510
among millions of others
on the planet.

-Action of any kind.

673

But let our action set the finer
points of our philosophy.

674

We don't have
to figure it all out.

675
01:11:10,744 --> 01:11:12,964
We all don't have
to be saints on this planet

676
01:11:13,007 --> 01:11:14,922
to do something for it.

677
01:11:14,966 --> 01:11:20,798
It's time for a warrior society
to rise up out of the Earth.

678
01:11:20,841 --> 01:11:23,409
And to put ourselves in front
of the juggernaut

679
01:11:23,453 --> 01:11:24,758
of destruction.

680
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:33,985
We need warriors,

681
01:11:34,028 --> 01:11:35,943
we need people
and bodies out in the field

682
01:11:35,987 --> 01:11:40,078
to take down the apparatus
of this mechanized destruction

683
01:11:40,121 --> 01:11:42,385
of this precious planet
that we have.

684

That's what my life is for.

And that's what
your lives should be for.

If you consider yourselves
eco-warriors,

687
01:11:51,219 --> 01:11:55,049
you have to get out,
put your-- stand your ground

688

01:12:24,557 --> 01:12:27,430
My route took me past
a beautiful spot.

697
01:12:27,473 --> 01:12:30,998
A favorite place of mine where
there was a spring of pure water

698
01:12:31,042 --> 01:12:33,174
that can safely
be drunk without worrying.

699
01:12:34,088 --> 01:12:36,439
I stopped
and said a kind of prayer

700
01:12:36,482 --> 01:12:39,267
to the spirit of the spring.

701
01:12:39,311 --> 01:12:41,879
It was a prayer in which I swore

702
01:12:41,922 --> 01:12:43,794
that I would take revenge

703
01:12:43,837 --> 01:12:46,318
for what was being done
with the forest.

[intricate classical

The people who are pushing all
this growth and progress garbage

707
01:14:01,872 --> 01:14:04,135
deserve to be severely punished.

708
01:14:04,178 --> 01:14:07,573
But our goal is less to punish
them than to propagate ideas.

709
01:14:10,489 --> 01:14:12,970
Introduction. One.

710
01:14:13,013 --> 01:14:15,842
The Industrial Revolution
and its consequences

711
01:14:15,886 --> 01:14:18,323
have been a disaster
for the human race.

712
01:14:20,151 --> 01:14:23,502
We therefore
advocate the revolution

713
01:14:23,546 --> 01:14:25,896
against the industrial system.

714
01:14:25,939 --> 01:14:29,203
Thirty-seven: we attribute
the social and psychological

715
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:32,380
problems with modern society
to the fact that the society

716
01:14:32,424 --> 01:14:34,861
requires people to live
under conditions

717
01:14:34,905 --> 01:14:36,950
radically different
from those under which

718
01:14:36,994 --> 01:14:38,474
the human race evolved.

719
01:14:39,649 --> 01:14:43,522
Forty-six: in order to avoid
serious psychological problems,

720
01:14:43,566 --> 01:14:45,219
a human being needs goals

721
01:14:45,263 --> 01:14:47,352
whose attainment
requires effort.

722
01:14:48,919 --> 01:14:52,749
Sixty-nine: it is true that
primitive man is powerless

723
01:14:52,792 --> 01:14:54,751
against some of the things
that threaten him,

724
01:14:54,794 --> 01:14:56,579
disease, for example,

725
01:14:56,622 --> 01:15:00,408
but he can accept
the risk of disease stoically.

726
01:15:00,452 --> 01:15:03,977
One-seventy:
"Oh!" say the technophiles,

727
01:15:04,021 --> 01:15:06,850
"Science is going to fix that.
We will conquer famine,

728
01:15:06,893 --> 01:15:09,026
"eliminate
psychological suffering,

729
01:15:09,069 --> 01:15:10,854
"make everybody
healthy and happy."

730
01:15:12,377 --> 01:15:13,770
Yeah, sure.

731
01:15:13,813 --> 01:15:15,685
That's what
they said 200 years ago.

732
01:15:17,730 --> 01:15:19,689
One-eighty:
When the system becomes

733
01:15:19,732 --> 01:15:21,778
sufficiently stressed
and unstable,

734
01:15:21,821 --> 01:15:24,607
a revolution against
technology may be possible.

735
01:15:27,348 --> 01:15:30,743
One-eighty-one: The technophiles
are taking us all

736
01:15:30,787 --> 01:15:35,269
on an utterly reckless ride
into the unknown.

737
01:15:38,185 --> 01:15:41,711
One eighty-five: as
for the negative consequences

738
01:15:41,754 --> 01:15:43,756
of eliminating
industrial society--

739
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:46,411
well, you can't eat your cake
and have it, too.

740
01:15:46,454 --> 01:15:50,502
To gain one thing you have
to sacrifice another.

741
01:16:35,678 --> 01:16:37,201
Becky.

742
01:16:39,333 --> 01:16:42,641
[laughing]

743
01:16:43,337 --> 01:16:46,776
I got a-- I got a fish!

744
01:16:46,819 --> 01:16:48,255
I got one!

745
01:16:48,299 --> 01:16:50,170
Yeah.
-Whoo! Good job!

746
01:16:50,214 --> 01:16:52,433
-Yeah!

747
01:16:53,086 --> 01:16:55,132
-Holy--

748
01:16:55,175 --> 01:16:56,655
That's amazing!

749
01:16:58,091 --> 01:17:00,920
[Ted chuckling]
It's big!

750
01:17:08,798 --> 01:17:11,061
[ominous instrumental]

751
01:17:56,933 --> 01:17:59,936
-No, no, there's nothing that
could ever be important enough

752
01:17:59,979 --> 01:18:01,502
for you to get in touch with me.

753
01:18:01,546 --> 01:18:03,548
Even if Mother dies,
I don't wanna hear about it.

754
01:18:03,591 --> 01:18:05,376
Mm-hmm.

755
01:18:05,419 --> 01:18:07,595
I have nothing more--
I have nothing more to--

756
01:18:08,771 --> 01:18:12,078
David-- David.
I just need a yes or no.

757
01:18:12,122 --> 01:18:13,863
Are you gonna--

758
01:18:13,906 --> 01:18:16,213
Will you please
help me with money?

759
01:18:16,256 --> 01:18:17,823
What do you want?
You want me to beg?

760
01:18:17,867 --> 01:18:20,826
I'm begging, David.
I'm on my fucking knees,

761
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:22,567
right in a phone booth,
begging you.

762
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:25,265
Do you feel powerful, David?
Do you feel empowered?

763
01:18:25,962 --> 01:18:28,355
The-- the strong, dominant male.

764
01:18:28,399 --> 01:18:32,229
Finally, you have your brother
on his knees, asking for money.

765
01:18:32,272 --> 01:18:35,014
Goddamn it, David!
Cocksucker, man!

766
01:18:35,058 --> 01:18:37,016
I-- I'm asking for--

767
01:18:45,024 --> 01:18:47,070
Yes. One thousand.

768
01:18:49,942 --> 01:18:52,597
Thank you, David.
Yes, I know.

769
01:18:54,033 --> 01:18:58,255
Yes, it is a brotherly act
and I-- it's noted.

770
01:19:00,866 --> 01:19:02,433
You too.

771
01:19:02,476 --> 01:19:04,652
Hugs and kisses to Linda.

772
01:19:04,696 --> 01:19:06,263
[chuckling]

773
01:19:06,306 --> 01:19:07,264
Okay.

774
01:19:23,671 --> 01:19:28,764
[distorted instrumental]

775
01:19:38,686 --> 01:19:40,645
Boredom is almost non-existent

776
01:19:40,688 --> 01:19:43,213
once you've become adapted
to life in the woods.

777
01:19:43,256 --> 01:19:45,519
If you don't have any work
that needs to be done,

778
01:19:45,563 --> 01:19:48,609
you can sit for hours
at a time, just doing nothing.

779
01:19:48,653 --> 01:19:52,700
Just listening to the birds
or the wind or the silence.

780
01:19:52,744 --> 01:19:55,442
Watching the shadows move
as the sun travels

781
01:19:57,183 --> 01:20:00,230
or simply looking
at familiar objects.

782
01:20:00,273 --> 01:20:02,536
And you don't get bored.

783
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:04,408
You're just a piece.

784
01:20:38,007 --> 01:20:40,226
[gunshot]

785
01:20:44,883 --> 01:20:48,974
[airplane engine roaring]

786
01:21:04,903 --> 01:21:08,776
[sound becomes distorted]

787
01:21:49,687 --> 01:21:52,211
To the San Francisco Examiner,

788
01:21:52,255 --> 01:21:54,648
we have waited until now
to announce ourselves

789
01:21:54,692 --> 01:21:57,825
because our earlier bombs
were embarrassingly ineffectual.

790
01:21:57,869 --> 01:22:00,959
The injuries they inflicted
were relatively minor.

791
01:22:01,003 --> 01:22:03,266
In order to influence people,
a terrorist group

792
01:22:03,309 --> 01:22:06,182
must show a certain
amount of success.

793
01:22:06,225 --> 01:22:08,967
When we finally realized
the amount of smokeless powder

794
01:22:09,011 --> 01:22:10,926
needed to blow up
anyone or anything

795
01:22:10,969 --> 01:22:12,492
was too large to be practical,

796
01:22:12,536 --> 01:22:14,494
we decided to take
a couple years off

797
01:22:14,538 --> 01:22:16,105
and learn something
about explosives

798
01:22:16,148 --> 01:22:18,150
and develop an effective bomb.

799
01:22:21,414 --> 01:22:23,025
In closure...

800
01:22:23,068 --> 01:22:25,636
the aim
of the Freedom Club

801
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:27,725
is the complete
and permanent destruction

802
01:22:27,768 --> 01:22:30,206
of modern industrial society
in every part of the world.

803
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:08,461
... potentially
by long distance,

804
01:23:08,505 --> 01:23:10,898
there's not a place

805
01:23:10,942 --> 01:23:15,033
to have conversation between
the perpetrator and the victims.

806
01:23:15,077 --> 01:23:18,210
So, the fact that we have

807
01:23:18,254 --> 01:23:24,521
one eyewitness, which is just
luck on our part, is really...

808
01:23:24,564 --> 01:23:28,351
We have looked
at all of the victims

809
01:23:28,394 --> 01:23:31,919
meticulously.
As to any correlation, so far

810
01:23:31,963 --> 01:23:34,444
it has just not being fruitful.

811
01:23:34,487 --> 01:23:37,229
Well, you have--
you have a wide range,

812
01:23:37,273 --> 01:23:39,362
actually, you have
corporate executives,

813
01:23:39,405 --> 01:23:43,757
you have one bomb placed aboard
an American Airlines aircraft,

814
01:23:43,801 --> 01:23:45,672
also in the late '70s.

815
01:23:45,716 --> 01:23:48,327
There have
been college professors.

816
01:23:48,371 --> 01:23:51,852
Two types of bombs
in the sense that about half

817
01:23:51,896 --> 01:23:55,987
of them are mailed,
letter bombs or package bombs.

818
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:58,163
And about half of them
have been placed

819
01:23:58,207 --> 01:24:01,166
in a position
where someone would, uh,

820
01:24:01,210 --> 01:24:03,647
disturb the package.

821
01:24:03,690 --> 01:24:07,085
[reporter continues
speaking indistinctly]

822
01:24:10,567 --> 01:24:14,136
Well, as long as I'm going
to throw everything away anyway,

823
01:24:14,179 --> 01:24:17,704
instead of having to shoot it
out with the cops or something,

824
01:24:17,748 --> 01:24:20,881
I will go up to Canada,
and take off into the woods

825
01:24:20,925 --> 01:24:23,623
with a rifle
and try to live off the country.

826
01:24:23,667 --> 01:24:25,277
If that doesn't work out

827
01:24:25,321 --> 01:24:27,236
and if I can
get back to civilization

828
01:24:27,279 --> 01:24:29,629
before I starve,
then I will come back here

829
01:24:29,673 --> 01:24:32,328
and kill someone I hate.

830
01:24:37,202 --> 01:24:39,900
I need to renew my passport.

831
01:24:40,814 --> 01:24:42,251
And...

832
01:25:30,081 --> 01:25:31,735
Clearly, we are in a position

833
01:25:31,778 --> 01:25:33,780
to do a great deal of damage.

834
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:35,347
And it doesn't appear
that the FBI

835
01:25:35,391 --> 01:25:37,654
is gonna catch
us anytime soon.

836
01:25:39,699 --> 01:25:42,441
The FBI is a joke.

837
01:25:57,761 --> 01:26:00,851
FBI, suck my cock.

838
01:26:03,158 --> 01:26:05,072
[explosion rumbling]

839
01:26:07,336 --> 01:26:12,210
[alarm bell ringing]

840
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:33,797
[clearing throat]

841
01:26:36,278 --> 01:26:37,583
[dinging bell]

842
01:26:42,936 --> 01:26:45,156
-Morning.
-Uh, morning.

843
01:26:46,244 --> 01:26:50,553
I have a complaint about
the Montana Telephone Company.

844
01:26:50,596 --> 01:26:54,513
It concerns, uh, some of your
payphones in Lincoln, Montana.

845
01:26:54,557 --> 01:26:58,256
These pay phones consistently
malfunction in such a manner

846
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:01,085
as to steal a caller's quarters.

847
01:27:01,128 --> 01:27:03,392
You put a quarter in and then
it either gets jammed

848
01:27:03,435 --> 01:27:05,350
or it doesn't register.

849
01:27:05,394 --> 01:27:06,960
And then the coin release
doesn't work

850
01:27:07,004 --> 01:27:08,875
so that either you can't
put the call through

851
01:27:08,919 --> 01:27:11,400
and the quarters are lost,
or the call does go through,

852
01:27:11,443 --> 01:27:13,793
but you end up paying 25 cents
or 50 cents more

853
01:27:13,837 --> 01:27:15,142
than the price of the call.

854
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:18,581
This problem has persisted
for several years.

855
01:27:21,758 --> 01:27:24,151
This is not the first time
that I have, uh--

856
01:27:24,195 --> 01:27:26,502
that I have complained,
although it is the first time

857
01:27:26,545 --> 01:27:28,112
that I've complained in person,

858
01:27:28,155 --> 01:27:29,940
but I've spoken to
the operators about it

859
01:27:29,983 --> 01:27:32,247
several times and nothing
has been done over the years.

860
01:27:33,073 --> 01:27:35,554
The main offender
is actually the payphone

861
01:27:35,598 --> 01:27:37,991
on the corner of Highway 200
and Stemple Pass.

862
01:27:38,035 --> 01:27:40,255
I'm forced to use that one
on occasion because

863
01:27:40,298 --> 01:27:41,821
it's the only one
that the company provides

864
01:27:41,865 --> 01:27:44,563
that offers any level
of privacy at all.

865
01:27:44,607 --> 01:27:47,262
But it steals at least
50% of my quarters.

866
01:27:47,305 --> 01:27:48,828
It swindles me.

867
01:27:48,872 --> 01:27:51,266
And the company is aware
of this offending booth.

868
01:27:51,962 --> 01:27:53,790
That's a criminal act.

869
01:27:53,833 --> 01:27:55,531
My money is being stolen.

870
01:27:58,055 --> 01:27:59,709
-On behalf
of the Montana phone company,

871
01:27:59,752 --> 01:28:02,842
I apologize
for your inconvenience.

872
01:28:02,886 --> 01:28:05,192
Uh, do you happen
to have a record

873
01:28:05,236 --> 01:28:06,977
of how much money
you've lost over the years?

874
01:28:07,020 --> 01:28:09,153
I do. $5.75.

875
01:28:09,196 --> 01:28:12,939
-$5.75?
-Yes. Yes, this year.

876
01:28:12,983 --> 01:28:14,289
-This year.
-Yes.

877
01:28:14,332 --> 01:28:16,029
-Hmm.

878
01:28:16,073 --> 01:28:19,206
-I have a letter
which, uh, you could give

879
01:28:19,250 --> 01:28:23,080
to your superiors,
and it contains all the details

880
01:28:23,123 --> 01:28:25,952
that I have
just relayed to you now.

881
01:28:25,996 --> 01:28:29,129
-I would love to give
it to my superiors, but...

882
01:28:29,173 --> 01:28:32,394
we can only accept letters
through the post.

883
01:28:33,438 --> 01:28:35,310
I can't hand deliver a letter.

884
01:28:36,354 --> 01:28:37,921
Do you see the problem?

885
01:28:44,667 --> 01:28:48,105
-I came in here to bring
you the letter in person.

886
01:28:48,148 --> 01:28:49,411
-I appreciate that.

887
01:28:50,847 --> 01:28:52,283
But I can't take it.

888
01:29:13,304 --> 01:29:15,306
You have a wonderful day.

889
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:17,526
I'm gonna write to
my congressman about this.

890
01:29:17,569 --> 01:29:19,092
Okay.

891
01:29:19,136 --> 01:29:25,403
[dreamy, melancholic
instrumental]

892
01:30:15,671 --> 01:30:17,586
[Ted]
During my romantic phase,

893
01:30:17,629 --> 01:30:21,154
I continued to have fantasies
of a primitive life,

894
01:30:21,198 --> 01:30:23,243
but I tended strongly
to embellish

895
01:30:23,287 --> 01:30:27,900
this with romantic details
like horns resounding through

896
01:30:27,944 --> 01:30:31,121
the forest, savage-looking
tunics and bearskin

897
01:30:31,164 --> 01:30:32,427
and so forth.

898
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:27,307
Sequence of small advances,
there will be no rational

899
01:31:27,351 --> 01:31:29,571
and effective public resistance.

900
01:31:29,614 --> 01:31:32,835
It is not possible to make
a lasting compromise

901
01:31:32,878 --> 01:31:35,098
between technology and freedom

902
01:31:35,141 --> 01:31:38,188
because technology is by far
the more powerful social force

903
01:31:38,231 --> 01:31:39,885
and continually...

904
01:31:39,929 --> 01:31:43,454
erodes on freedom
through repeated compromise.

905
01:31:45,325 --> 01:31:46,718
[muttering indistinctly]

906
01:32:01,603 --> 01:32:04,431
As society
and the problems that face it

907
01:32:04,475 --> 01:32:06,259
become more and more complex,

908
01:32:06,303 --> 01:32:09,132
and as machines become
more and more intelligent,

909
01:32:09,175 --> 01:32:12,048
people will let machines
make more and more

910
01:32:12,091 --> 01:32:14,006
of their decisions for them,

911
01:32:14,050 --> 01:32:16,269
simply because
machine-made decisions

912
01:32:16,313 --> 01:32:19,577
will bring better results
than manmade ones.

913
01:32:22,362 --> 01:32:24,451
Eventually,
a stage may be reached

914
01:32:24,495 --> 01:32:26,628
at which the decisions
necessary to keep

915
01:32:26,671 --> 01:32:29,239
the system running will be
so complex that human beings

916
01:32:29,282 --> 01:32:32,329
will be incapable
of making them intelligently.

917
01:32:32,372 --> 01:32:35,637
At that stage, the machines
will be in effective control.

918
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:38,378
People won't be able
to just turn the machines

919
01:32:38,422 --> 01:32:40,424
off because they will
be so dependent on them

920
01:32:40,467 --> 01:32:42,818
that turning them
off would amount to suicide.

921
01:32:46,604 --> 01:32:49,955
[loud thud, horn honking]

922
01:32:58,964 --> 01:33:01,097
[man groaning]

923
01:33:01,140 --> 01:33:04,361
[men laughing]

924
01:33:06,450 --> 01:33:10,149
[laughter continues]

925
01:33:13,022 --> 01:33:18,288
[laughing]

926
01:33:18,331 --> 01:33:21,683
-I must have been going
40 fucking miles per hour.

927
01:33:21,726 --> 01:33:24,903
[laughing]

928
01:33:33,782 --> 01:33:37,829
[chain clanking]
[screeching]

929
01:34:03,986 --> 01:34:06,162
-You know, my parents...

930
01:34:06,205 --> 01:34:10,035
pushed me so hard in academia,
I never really learned

931
01:34:10,079 --> 01:34:12,559
to be at ease around women.

932
01:34:12,603 --> 01:34:14,431
-Can you tell me your heart,
Ted?

933
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:17,303
You're quite right.

934
01:34:17,347 --> 01:34:18,565
You love me.

935
01:34:19,088 --> 01:34:20,393
-I do.

936
01:34:21,438 --> 01:34:24,136
I do. See, actually, uh...

937
01:34:24,180 --> 01:34:25,964
It's the truth. I love you.

938
01:34:26,008 --> 01:34:28,532
I love you so much I'm gonna
let go of these handlebars.

939
01:34:28,575 --> 01:34:30,708
-No, don't do it!
-I'm gonna let go!

940
01:34:30,752 --> 01:34:32,492
-No, please don't.
-Okay, one hand.

941
01:34:32,536 --> 01:34:34,059
Just one hand, okay?

942
01:34:34,103 --> 01:34:36,061
Come on, there you go,
there you go!

943
01:34:36,975 --> 01:34:38,934
-Put it down!
-Okay, okay.

944
01:34:38,977 --> 01:34:41,197
Oh, the right hand come off!
You're my right hand.

945
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:43,503
You might have to be
the right hand of a man.

946
01:34:43,547 --> 01:34:45,375
Okay, okay.

947
01:34:45,418 --> 01:34:51,903
[both laughing]

948
01:34:52,599 --> 01:34:54,558
[Ted whooping]

949
01:34:54,601 --> 01:34:59,171
[laughing]

950
01:35:15,579 --> 01:35:19,452
We are an anarchist group...

951
01:35:19,496 --> 01:35:24,066
...calling ourselves...

952
01:35:24,109 --> 01:35:26,764
Calling ourselves FC.
...FC.

953
01:35:26,808 --> 01:35:30,376
Notice that the postmark
on this envelope

954
01:35:30,420 --> 01:35:32,335
precedes a newsworthy event

955
01:35:32,378 --> 01:35:36,078
that will happen about the time
you receive this letter,

956
01:35:36,121 --> 01:35:38,123
if nothing goes wrong.

957
01:35:38,167 --> 01:35:43,781
We are getting tired

958
01:35:43,825 --> 01:35:48,264
of making bombs.

959
01:35:50,962 --> 01:35:54,444
It's no fun having to spend
all your evenings and weekends

960
01:35:54,487 --> 01:35:56,359
preparing dangerous mixtures,

961
01:35:56,402 --> 01:35:59,144
filing trigger mechanisms
out of scraps of metal

962
01:35:59,188 --> 01:36:01,016
or searching the Sierras
for a place

963
01:36:01,059 --> 01:36:03,018
isolated enough
to test the bomb.

964
01:36:03,061 --> 01:36:04,671
[explosion rumbling]

965
01:36:05,368 --> 01:36:07,370
So we offer a bargain.

966
01:36:08,458 --> 01:36:11,374
We have a long article
between 29,000

967
01:36:11,417 --> 01:36:14,856
and 37,000 words
that we want to have published.

968
01:36:14,899 --> 01:36:18,642
If you can get it published
according to our requirements,

969
01:36:18,685 --> 01:36:22,298
we will permanently desist
from terrorist activities.

970
01:36:22,341 --> 01:36:24,474
If the answer is satisfactory,

971
01:36:24,517 --> 01:36:26,868
we will finish typing
the manuscript and send

972
01:36:26,911 --> 01:36:29,609
it to you. If the answer
is unsatisfactory,

973
01:36:29,653 --> 01:36:31,568
we will start building
our next bomb.

974
01:36:31,611 --> 01:36:35,354
-[explosion rumbling]
-[objects clattering]

975
01:36:36,007 --> 01:36:37,443
FC.

976
01:36:38,531 --> 01:36:40,577
[chuckling]

977
01:37:41,638 --> 01:37:44,467
I am choked with frustration
at my inability to get

978
01:37:44,510 --> 01:37:47,731
my stinking fucking family
off my back once and for all.

979
01:37:48,427 --> 01:37:50,212
No, it does include you, David.

980
01:37:50,255 --> 01:37:51,648
It emphatically
and specifically

981
01:37:51,691 --> 01:37:53,606
includes you, yeah.

982
01:37:53,650 --> 01:37:56,261
Of course, you-- you're part
of my stinking fucking family.

983
01:37:56,305 --> 01:37:58,829
It's not an emotional decision.
It's a logical decision, David.

984
01:37:58,873 --> 01:38:01,353
It's logical.
Yeah, I have my own life.

985
01:38:01,397 --> 01:38:03,703
I have my own life, David,
I think my own thoughts

986
01:38:03,747 --> 01:38:05,836
and then I do what
I think I should do,

987
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:07,229
as opposed to
what other people--

988
01:38:07,272 --> 01:38:08,665
Look, I'm not-- I'm not--

989
01:38:08,708 --> 01:38:10,580
I'm not gonna do this again.

990
01:38:10,623 --> 01:38:13,061
I'm not gonna do this again
with you, David. All right?

991
01:38:13,104 --> 01:38:15,585
I do not want to hear
from you or any member

992
01:38:15,628 --> 01:38:18,893
of my stinking
fucking family ever again.

993
01:38:19,589 --> 01:38:20,807
Goodbye.

994
01:38:42,133 --> 01:38:43,743
Hi.
[driver speaking indistinctly]

995
01:38:43,787 --> 01:38:45,049
Yeah, yeah.

996
01:39:07,028 --> 01:39:10,857
-This is CNN breaking news.

997
01:39:10,901 --> 01:39:12,947
-Hello from CNN News Center
in Atlanta,

998
01:39:12,990 --> 01:39:15,471
I'm Natalie Allen.
We're about to take live

999
01:39:15,514 --> 01:39:17,473
a news conference
from San Francisco

1000
01:39:17,516 --> 01:39:20,345
headed up by the FBI today
concerning the bomb threat

1001
01:39:20,389 --> 01:39:22,391
that has come in.
The person behind the threat

1002
01:39:22,434 --> 01:39:24,697
may be the so-called Unabomber,

1003
01:39:24,741 --> 01:39:27,222
and the threat has resulted
in heightened security

1004
01:39:27,265 --> 01:39:29,746
at five airports in--

1005
01:39:29,789 --> 01:39:33,054
Small debris,
big debris, dust--

1006
01:39:33,097 --> 01:39:35,752
I'm relieved to
see a lot of security around--

1007
01:39:35,795 --> 01:39:37,841
...and determination?

1008
01:39:37,884 --> 01:39:40,191
-Well, our position is we will
keep the security measures

1009
01:39:40,235 --> 01:39:42,977
in place until
the matter is resolved.

1010
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:44,761
It's been more
than five days since

1011
01:39:44,804 --> 01:39:47,198
the Unabomber threatened
to blow up an airliner

1012
01:39:47,242 --> 01:39:50,680
flying in or out
of Los Angeles by July 4th.

1013
01:39:50,723 --> 01:39:54,510
But after 17 years,
23 injuries and three deaths,

1014
01:39:54,553 --> 01:39:57,469
the Unabomber
is nothing to joke about.

1015
01:39:57,513 --> 01:40:00,429
Experts say the Unabomber
is stepping up his activities

1016
01:40:00,472 --> 01:40:02,431
because he's jealous
of the attention given

1017
01:40:02,474 --> 01:40:04,433
to the Oklahoma City bombing

1018
01:40:04,476 --> 01:40:06,043
which stole the thunder

1019
01:40:06,087 --> 01:40:07,697
from his last
package bomb explosion.

1020
01:40:07,740 --> 01:40:09,873
Experts also believe
the Unabomber

1021
01:40:09,916 --> 01:40:11,875
may be headed for a fall.

1022
01:40:11,918 --> 01:40:14,051
I think he's on a high now.

1023
01:40:14,095 --> 01:40:16,184
I think he's all pumped up.

1024
01:40:16,227 --> 01:40:18,708
I think he's intoxicated
with his own power,

1025
01:40:18,751 --> 01:40:21,537
and I think at this point,
he's most vulnerable.

1026
01:40:21,580 --> 01:40:23,582
[indistinct]

1027
01:40:23,626 --> 01:40:25,802
I think he might
have made some major mistakes.

1028
01:41:01,794 --> 01:41:03,883
The FBI is unable to catch him,

1029
01:41:03,927 --> 01:41:06,234
and now the Unabomber
has raised the stakes again.

1030
01:41:06,277 --> 01:41:08,540
In the letter sent
to The Washington Post

1031
01:41:08,584 --> 01:41:10,760
and the New York Times this
week, the Unabomber has pledged

1032
01:41:10,803 --> 01:41:12,936
to stop his murderous spree
if these leading American papers

1033
01:41:12,979 --> 01:41:15,243
will publish
a 35,000-word manifesto.

1034
01:41:15,286 --> 01:41:18,246
In the document the Unabomber
condemns modern technology

1035
01:41:18,289 --> 01:41:20,335
and says computers have
created a world in which humans

1036
01:41:20,378 --> 01:41:23,381
are mere cogs in the machine.
That proposal has led to a life

1037
01:41:23,425 --> 01:41:25,949
or death question
for The Post and

1038
01:41:25,992 --> 01:41:28,299
should they cave in to threats
and publish, or refuse

1039
01:41:28,343 --> 01:41:30,171
to let themselves be
used as a platform--

1040
01:41:30,214 --> 01:41:33,913
In paragraph 125,
we use an analogy of a weak

1041
01:41:33,957 --> 01:41:37,482
neighbor who was left destitute
by a strong neighbor who takes

1042
01:41:37,526 --> 01:41:41,182
all his land by forcing on
him a series of compromises.

1043
01:41:41,225 --> 01:41:44,881
But suppose now that
the strong neighbor gets sick

1044
01:41:44,924 --> 01:41:47,318
so that he is unable
to defend himself.

1045
01:41:47,362 --> 01:41:50,147
The weak neighbor
can force the strong one

1046
01:41:50,191 --> 01:41:52,802
to give him his land back
or he can kill him.

1047
01:41:52,845 --> 01:41:56,066
If he lets the strong man
survive and only forces him

1048
01:41:56,110 --> 01:41:58,242
to give his land back,
he is a fool,

1049
01:41:58,286 --> 01:42:01,289
because when the strong man gets
well, he will again take all

1050
01:42:01,332 --> 01:42:03,204
the land for himself.

1051
01:42:03,247 --> 01:42:05,554
The only sensible alternative
for the weaker man is to kill

1052
01:42:05,597 --> 01:42:08,818
a strong one while he has
the chance. In the same way,

1053
01:42:08,861 --> 01:42:10,776
while the industrial
system is sick,

1054
01:42:10,820 --> 01:42:13,953
we must destroy it.
If we compromise with it

1055
01:42:13,997 --> 01:42:15,781
and let it recover
from its sickness,

1056
01:42:15,825 --> 01:42:17,696
it will eventually wipe
out all of our freedom.

1057
01:42:18,523 --> 01:42:20,699
We're back
at CNN in Washington--

1058
01:42:21,265 --> 01:42:23,093
We hear somebody yelling,
"It ain't gonna happen."

1059
01:42:26,401 --> 01:42:29,317
Trying to catch back up
to O.J. Simpson heading past

1060
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:32,581
LAX on the 405 freeway north.

1061
01:42:34,235 --> 01:42:36,541
Again, you see traffic
in the South lanes stopping

1062
01:42:36,585 --> 01:42:38,587
and looking,
police cars trailing,

1063
01:42:38,630 --> 01:42:41,677
other traffic, stopping off to
the right.

1064
01:42:47,073 --> 01:42:49,424
[indistinct chatter]

1065
01:42:56,518 --> 01:42:58,433
Hey, Gilbert,
you should take this,

1066
01:42:58,476 --> 01:43:00,522
even though it isn't for you.
-Maybe it's a bomb.

1067
01:43:00,565 --> 01:43:02,219
You should send
that off to Bill.

1068
01:43:02,263 --> 01:43:03,916
Maybe it's a love letter.

1069
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:06,876
Oh, it's Oklahoma City.
Oh, be careful.

1070
01:43:18,192 --> 01:43:20,977
This Postal
Service circulates a special

1071
01:43:21,020 --> 01:43:23,458
training tape illustrating
detection techniques.

1072
01:43:23,501 --> 01:43:26,025
It also graphically
demonstrates the power

1073
01:43:26,069 --> 01:43:29,377
of a mail bomb by use
of a dummy in a mock-up office.

1074
01:43:29,420 --> 01:43:31,553
He's matching
wits, he's matching wits

1075
01:43:31,596 --> 01:43:33,946
with everybody who comes
into conflict with him.

1076
01:43:33,990 --> 01:43:36,253
This is the arena.
This is the Coliseum.

1077
01:43:36,297 --> 01:43:38,647
"It's me against the lion."

1078
01:43:38,690 --> 01:43:41,127
Add to this
the letter received

1079
01:43:41,171 --> 01:43:44,043
by The New York Times, a letter
sent before the latest bombings.

1080
01:43:44,087 --> 01:43:47,525
It warned of a newsworthy
event and claimed responsibility

1081
01:43:47,569 --> 01:43:50,876
in the name of an anarchist
group calling itself FC.

1082
01:43:50,920 --> 01:43:52,748
We don't have
a shred of evidence

1083
01:43:52,791 --> 01:43:54,880
that he's connected
with any other people.

1084
01:43:54,924 --> 01:43:58,101
The FBI says
it's up to The New York Times,

1085
01:43:58,144 --> 01:43:59,929
whether they comply
with the Unabomber's

1086
01:43:59,972 --> 01:44:01,713
demand to publish
a long-written piece.

1087
01:44:01,757 --> 01:44:04,673
But the FBI seems
to doubt the sincerity

1088
01:44:04,716 --> 01:44:06,370
of the Unabomber's offer.

1089
01:44:06,414 --> 01:44:08,242
That's because,
in the same letter,

1090
01:44:08,285 --> 01:44:10,722
he reserves the right
to engage in sabotage

1091
01:44:10,766 --> 01:44:14,160
intended to damage
property instead of humans.

1092

1100
01:46:10,755 --> 01:46:12,627
This morning in Washington,

1101
01:46:12,670 --> 01:46:15,194
the news dominating
street corner conversation

1102
01:46:15,238 --> 01:46:18,110
was what was on the front page
of this morning's paper.

1103
01:46:18,154 --> 01:46:21,462
The Washington Post
had published a special section

1104
01:46:21,505 --> 01:46:24,421
containing the
35,000-word manifesto

1105
01:46:24,465 --> 01:46:27,381
of the serial mail bomber
known as Unabomber.

1106
01:46:27,424 --> 01:46:30,035
The post cited quote,
"Public safety reasons"

1107
01:46:30,079 --> 01:46:32,821
for its decision,
taken and paid for jointly

1108
01:46:32,864 --> 01:46:34,779
with The New York Times.

1109
01:46:34,823 --> 01:46:37,956
In an unusual joint statement,
publishers Donald Graham

1110
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,481
of The Post
and Arthur Sulzberger Jr.

1111
01:46:40,524 --> 01:46:43,048
of the Times justified
publication.

1112
01:46:43,092 --> 01:46:46,182
Quote, "If we fail
to do so, the Unabomber--"

1113
01:46:48,010 --> 01:46:49,707
[laughing]

1114
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:07,943
-Yeah! Yeah!

1115
01:47:12,295 --> 01:47:14,428
[laughing]

1116
01:47:18,954 --> 01:47:20,912
Unfortunately,
for attorney general and the FBI

1117
01:47:20,956 --> 01:47:23,785
have all surrendered
authority to the Unabomber.

1118
01:47:23,828 --> 01:47:27,266
I can see this fellow
who has to be right now

1119
01:47:27,310 --> 01:47:30,139
having a psychological orgasm.

1120
01:47:30,182 --> 01:47:33,185
They've elevated him
to controlling,

1121
01:47:33,229 --> 01:47:37,102
like a puppeteer, cities,
newspapers and everything else.

1122
01:47:37,146 --> 01:47:39,191
Where does it go from here?

1123
01:47:39,235 --> 01:47:41,585
It's difficult
to argue with his logic.

1124
01:47:41,629 --> 01:47:43,761
You can bet that neither
The New York Times

1125
01:47:43,805 --> 01:47:46,416
nor The Washington Post
would have published his essay

1126
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:49,288
absent his track record
as a murderer

1127
01:47:49,332 --> 01:47:51,639
and his, therefore,
totally credible threat

1128
01:47:51,682 --> 01:47:53,075
that he would kill again.

with the popular belief

1133
01:49:38,920 --> 01:49:41,966
"that you are a serial killer
and should be treated like one.

1134
01:49:43,315 --> 01:49:46,580
"I pointed out that serial
killers derive the whole

1135
01:49:46,623 --> 01:49:49,278
"of their satisfaction
from the act of killing.

01:49:50,453 --> 01:49:52,673

I suggested that killing

1137
01:49:52,716 --> 01:49:54,849

Hey, can you come
to show us your boundary?

1151
01:55:41,325 --> 01:55:43,545
We're trying to figure it out
where your property line ends.

1152
01:55:55,949 --> 01:55:58,647
-Morning, Ted.
-Morning.

1153
01:55:58,690 --> 01:56:00,910
-This is Bob and Mike.
They're miners.

1154
01:56:02,390 --> 01:56:04,740
-Good morning, Mr. Kaczynski.

1155
01:56:04,783 --> 01:56:08,309
We've been doing a little mining
in the area and, well, we just

1156
01:56:08,352 --> 01:56:12,226
got a little bit confused about
where your property line ends.

1157
01:56:17,057 --> 01:56:19,755
And we were hoping
that you could show us

1158
01:56:19,798 --> 01:56:22,018
exactly where this line is.

1159
01:56:25,674 --> 01:56:27,763
-Yeah. Yeah, no. All right,

1160
01:56:27,806 --> 01:56:29,983
let me just get my jacket--

1161

Get your fucking
hands off of me!

1163
01:56:35,031 --> 01:56:37,468
Get your fucking
hands off of me!

1164
01:56:38,208 --> 01:56:41,603
-Mr. Kaczynski, we are the FBI.

1165
01:56:41,646 --> 01:56:44,780
We have a warrant
to search your cabin.

1166
01:56:49,263 --> 01:56:51,439
-Okay. Okay.

1167
01:56:51,482 --> 01:56:53,093
Yeah.

...we're told
by federal law enforcement

1172
01:58:10,866 --> 01:58:14,391
officials is that they received
a tip on this person indirectly

1173
01:58:14,435 --> 01:58:16,480
from a family member.

1174
01:58:16,524 --> 01:58:19,309
This man's brother contacted
a prominent Washington D.C.

1175
01:58:19,353 --> 01:58:22,399
lawyer, who in turn
got in touch with the FBI

1176
01:58:22,443 --> 01:58:24,488
and told them about this person,
and they've had him under

1177
01:58:24,532 --> 01:58:27,187
surveillance now for about
a week or so, we're told.

1178
01:58:27,230 --> 01:58:30,015
They are preparing right now
to serve a search warrant,

1179
01:58:30,059 --> 01:58:32,583
or probably in the process
of serving it now.

1180
01:58:32,627 --> 01:58:35,151
We don't know whether this
person is at home,

1181
01:58:35,195 --> 01:58:37,110
or what they expect
to find there.

1182
01:58:37,153 --> 01:58:38,937
If they're just going to
find evidence that they would

1183
01:58:38,981 --> 01:58:40,852
take from the house,
possible evidence,

1184
01:58:40,896 --> 01:58:42,854
or whether they're actually
going to find something.

1185
01:58:42,898 --> 01:58:44,682
We don't know whether there's
been any arrest yet...
