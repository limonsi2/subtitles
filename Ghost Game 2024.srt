3
00:01:27,294 --> 00:01:29,468
What the fuck?
We're leaving.

4
00:01:29,606 --> 00:01:30,814
Fuck that.

5
00:01:30,952 --> 00:01:32,264
You know the rules.

6
00:01:32,402 --> 00:01:36,096
What fucking rules?
It's punk rock.

7
00:01:38,305 --> 00:01:39,789
Shit.

8
00:01:42,067 --> 00:01:45,829
Fucking shit.

9
00:01:50,627 --> 00:01:53,837
Holy shit.

10
00:01:53,975 --> 00:01:56,461
Holy shit.

11
00:02:02,674 --> 00:02:04,503
What are you doing?

12
00:02:04,641 --> 00:02:05,884
I...

13
00:02:06,022 --> 00:02:07,299
You've only been here a week
and you're spying on me?

14
00:02:07,437 --> 00:02:08,300
No, I was-- I was gonna.

15
00:02:08,438 --> 00:02:10,854
On my fuckin' laptop?

16
00:02:10,992 --> 00:02:12,304
Mine's dead.

17
00:02:12,442 --> 00:02:14,893
The cord's still packed.

18
00:02:15,825 --> 00:02:17,516
That was you, wasn't it?

19
00:02:17,654 --> 00:02:19,449
Jesus, no.

20
00:02:19,587 --> 00:02:22,866
What is this,
like, a snuff film?

21
00:02:23,004 --> 00:02:27,008
Three stitches
and a night in the hospital.

22
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,010
But that was you.

23
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,530
In the mask.

24
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:35,327
And the softball trophy.

25
00:02:35,465 --> 00:02:36,880
Come on, Laura.

26
00:02:37,018 --> 00:02:38,882
This is bullshit.

27
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:42,023
How-- how can you expect
to make living together work

28
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:46,027
if we're keeping secrets
from each other?

29
00:02:50,308 --> 00:02:53,414
At least throw down some pants!

30
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:11,294
Neighbor said there was
a dead body in this car.

31
00:03:11,432 --> 00:03:14,504
- Is that you?
- Yeah. Yeah.

32
00:03:14,642 --> 00:03:17,473
Uh, girl kicked me out.

33
00:03:17,611 --> 00:03:18,888
Okay, we have two choices.

34
00:03:19,026 --> 00:03:22,719
You can go make up with her,
or you gotta clear out.

35
00:03:48,089 --> 00:03:51,955
Come on, I brought breakfast!

36
00:04:12,562 --> 00:04:15,669
Unpacked pack your Xbox.

37
00:04:16,635 --> 00:04:17,843
Who's...

38
00:04:17,981 --> 00:04:20,467
Oh, Vin, meet Adrian.

39
00:04:20,605 --> 00:04:22,779
The creep with the scissors.

40
00:04:22,917 --> 00:04:25,368
Harsh, but not inaccurate.

41
00:04:25,506 --> 00:04:27,163
Adrian and I met online.

42
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:29,959
Through a private board.

43
00:04:30,097 --> 00:04:31,754
Private board?

44
00:04:31,892 --> 00:04:35,275
Sit down. Sit down, Vin.

45
00:04:35,413 --> 00:04:38,312
Yeah, you know
that video that you saw,

46
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,177
so it's not exactly a sex thing.

47
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:42,834
It's not a violence thing
either.

48
00:04:42,972 --> 00:04:46,734
It's-- it's a hobby.
A lifestyle.

49
00:04:46,872 --> 00:04:48,667
It's art.

50
00:04:48,805 --> 00:04:49,875
We call it Ghost Game.

51
00:04:50,013 --> 00:04:51,429
Hey, just-- just show him.

52
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,486
This is, like, prank shit?

53
00:05:14,624 --> 00:05:16,316
Watch.

54
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:21,148
Okay, that's Mr. Whatley.

55
00:05:21,286 --> 00:05:23,115
He has the best theories.

56
00:05:23,253 --> 00:05:25,048
Whatley's overhyped.

57
00:05:25,186 --> 00:05:27,844
So, this is, like,
some cosplay home invasion?

58
00:05:27,982 --> 00:05:29,225
No.

59
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:30,985
Again, it's a challenge.

60
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:33,367
You live in the house without
the homeowners knowing.

61
00:05:33,505 --> 00:05:38,338
Mr. Whatley was inside
that house for eight nights.

62
00:05:40,063 --> 00:05:41,237
That's my hand right there.

63
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,134
Money shot, money shot.

64
00:05:42,272 --> 00:05:43,273
Oh! No!

65
00:05:43,412 --> 00:05:44,240
Oh, no, sh-- shit!

66
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:46,863
Real nice.

67
00:05:47,001 --> 00:05:49,556
Okay, Whatley has three rules.

68
00:05:49,694 --> 00:05:50,936
Don't get caught.

69
00:05:51,074 --> 00:05:52,869
Don't steal anything.

70
00:05:53,007 --> 00:05:54,561
And have a plan.

71
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:55,838
I don't get it.

72
00:05:55,976 --> 00:05:56,770
What's the point?

73
00:05:56,908 --> 00:05:59,186
Well, the point is the thrill.

74
00:05:59,324 --> 00:06:01,015
It's like...

75
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:02,189
An orgasm?

76
00:06:02,327 --> 00:06:03,742
I was going to say therapy.

77
00:06:04,571 --> 00:06:05,882
Look.

78
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,954
Adrian and I have been
planning something short notice.

79
00:06:09,092 --> 00:06:10,128
We got an opportunity.

80
00:06:10,266 --> 00:06:11,888
An opportunity
to break and enter?

81
00:06:12,026 --> 00:06:13,200
A haunt.

82
00:06:13,338 --> 00:06:15,202
That's what they're called.

83
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,135
And Adrian got a lead.

84
00:06:17,273 --> 00:06:18,723
Can't really call dibs
on a lead.

85
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:21,035
It's the first to the location
who gets it.

86
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:23,590
So, you're not really asking
for permission?

87
00:06:23,728 --> 00:06:25,246
Okay.

88
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,766
I don't need
anybody's permission.

89
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:29,630
So, if we're gonna do this,

90
00:06:29,768 --> 00:06:31,252
I have to be able
to live my own life

91
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,426
and you live your own life.

92
00:06:32,564 --> 00:06:35,256
We have our own interests,
our own hobbies.

93
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,810
Hobbies?

94
00:06:36,948 --> 00:06:38,674
A hobby is fucking
playing Catan.

95
00:06:38,812 --> 00:06:39,985
Just tell him about
the Halton House.

96
00:06:40,123 --> 00:06:40,814
That might shut him up.

97
00:06:40,952 --> 00:06:43,541
- Adrian.
- What?

98
00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:45,750
Halton House?

99
00:06:45,888 --> 00:06:47,717
The Amityville place?

100
00:06:47,855 --> 00:06:49,443
Oh, Amityville
is a mass shooting.

101
00:06:49,581 --> 00:06:51,756
This is a mass drowning.
It's way harder.

102
00:06:51,894 --> 00:06:52,860
Logistically speaking.

103
00:06:52,998 --> 00:06:55,069
But wouldn't that place
be empty?

104
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:57,002
Well, see that's the tip, Vinny.

105
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,348
The place was empty.

106
00:06:58,487 --> 00:06:59,626
Previous owners
already sold the property,

107
00:06:59,764 --> 00:07:03,112
but new owners,
new owners are just movin' in.

108
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,769
Dude, can I get a minute?

109
00:07:04,907 --> 00:07:08,600
With my girlfriend. Please.

110
00:07:12,052 --> 00:07:13,191
Picked a real winner here.
Good job, Laura.

111
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:16,436
Okay, shut up, Adrian.

112
00:07:20,785 --> 00:07:23,684
You're gonna break into a house
with that asshole?

113
00:07:23,822 --> 00:07:25,859
It's a two person-job.

114
00:07:25,997 --> 00:07:29,621
Well, what if you
had a new partner?

115
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,244
You can show me the ropes.
I can learn.

116
00:07:32,382 --> 00:07:34,143
Well, you can't exactly
pick up a basketball

117
00:07:34,281 --> 00:07:36,559
and play for the Wizards.

118
00:07:36,697 --> 00:07:38,837
He doesn't seem
like LeBron James.

119
00:07:38,975 --> 00:07:41,046
Is he on the Wizards?

120
00:07:41,184 --> 00:07:43,842
Okay, you know what?

121
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:48,157
Laura, you showed me this
for a reason.

122
00:07:48,295 --> 00:07:51,678
You wanted to let me in.

123
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,095
What about Adrian?

124
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:57,028
Tell him...

125
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,030
Tell him you're calling it off.

126
00:07:59,168 --> 00:08:01,895
That I fucked everything up.

127
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:05,036
Your square boyfriend.

128
00:08:05,174 --> 00:08:07,521
Always messing things up.

129
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,491
Always.

130
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:13,251
What? Fuckin' what?

131
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:14,114
It's everything off
that we've done!

132
00:08:14,252 --> 00:08:14,908
I'm not fuckin' anything up!

133
00:08:15,046 --> 00:08:15,805
Everything!

134
00:08:15,943 --> 00:08:16,599
Why the fuck are you yellin'?

135
00:08:16,737 --> 00:08:17,842
Laura, shut the fuck up!

136
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,188
Okay, alright. In the car.

137
00:08:19,326 --> 00:08:21,086
You don't want to us ruin
our friendship, Adrian,

138
00:08:21,224 --> 00:08:23,433
get the fuck out of here then!

139
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:25,677
Get the fuck out of here!

140
00:08:25,815 --> 00:08:26,885
Get out of here!

141
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:56,328
I made it for you.

142
00:08:56,466 --> 00:08:57,985
Do you like it?

143
00:08:58,123 --> 00:09:01,092
Yeah, it's-- it's perfect.

144
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:16,348
Halton House.

145
00:09:16,486 --> 00:09:19,628
Perhaps the most infamously
haunted house in the U.S.

146
00:09:19,766 --> 00:09:21,733
Despite its spacious
accommodations

147
00:09:21,871 --> 00:09:23,252
and dramatic architecture,

148
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:26,807
it sits abandoned
on Terrace Hills, rotting.

149
00:09:26,945 --> 00:09:28,913
The story of its
prior residents,

150
00:09:29,051 --> 00:09:30,535
so tragic and chilling,

151
00:09:30,673 --> 00:09:34,056
it's warded off even the most
curious for over half a century.

152
00:09:34,194 --> 00:09:35,816
What lurks inside these walls

153
00:09:35,954 --> 00:09:37,818
that could have driven
an ordinary woman

154
00:09:37,956 --> 00:09:40,407
to the most heinous of acts?

155
00:09:41,235 --> 00:09:43,410
Adelaide Halton
grew up in the manor.

156
00:09:43,548 --> 00:09:45,136
Her father, Abraham Halton,

157
00:09:45,274 --> 00:09:47,276
had inherited it
from his father,

158
00:09:47,414 --> 00:09:48,933
the former mayor
of Terrace County,

159
00:09:49,071 --> 00:09:50,279
Gunther Halton.

160
00:09:50,417 --> 00:09:54,801
Both died young,
mysteriously, in the house.

161
00:09:54,939 --> 00:09:56,009
Adelaide Halton was named

162
00:09:56,147 --> 00:09:57,769
Maryland's
Homemaker of the Year,

163
00:09:57,907 --> 00:09:59,529
a record five times,

164
00:09:59,668 --> 00:10:01,842
a record that still stands,
even in death,

165
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,569
if only that is
what she was remembered for.

166
00:10:06,295 --> 00:10:07,399
By all accounts,

167
00:10:07,537 --> 00:10:08,849
the family was happy
and thriving

168
00:10:08,987 --> 00:10:10,748
up until that tragic evening.

169
00:10:10,886 --> 00:10:13,440
Neighbors saw Adelaide playing
with the children in the yard

170
00:10:13,578 --> 00:10:15,097
just hours before,

171
00:10:15,235 --> 00:10:19,722
laughing, smiling,
a picture-perfect family.

172
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,552
What happened between then
and the moment she prepared

173
00:10:22,691 --> 00:10:25,210
for that final meal
is anyone's guess.

174
00:10:25,348 --> 00:10:29,732
Some have claimed the house was
tainted in some way, haunted.

175
00:10:32,286 --> 00:10:33,149
Time for dessert.

176
00:10:33,287 --> 00:10:34,703
I've made custard.

177
00:10:35,842 --> 00:10:37,878
Little did
the unsuspecting family know

178
00:10:38,016 --> 00:10:40,570
they were ingesting
nightshade custard.

179
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:43,021
The flour is poisonous
in large doses,

180
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:45,541
but Adelaide had
other intentions,

181
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:49,718
lacing each pie with just enough
to only paralyze her prey.

182
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,387
The house had five full baths,

183
00:11:04,525 --> 00:11:06,700
enough for even
the smallest members

184
00:11:06,838 --> 00:11:09,876
to have their own tub.

185
00:11:17,849 --> 00:11:19,782
It's unclear what happened next,

186
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,785
but legend has it that
after killing her family,

187
00:11:22,923 --> 00:11:24,442
Adelaide returned
to the sitting room

188
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,582
for a glass of rosemary tea.

189
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,516
She then climbed
to the top of Halton House,

190
00:11:29,654 --> 00:11:32,174
for her final act.

191
00:11:35,073 --> 00:11:38,076
After several days, authorities
were sent to the home

192
00:11:38,214 --> 00:11:42,253
to find all four members of
the Halton family deceased.

Whoa!

219
00:13:33,571 --> 00:13:35,124
Oh, look. Look, look, look.

220
00:13:35,262 --> 00:13:38,472
The window at the very top.

221
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,130
Fuck.

222
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:43,546
Hey!

223
00:13:43,684 --> 00:13:46,549
Private property. Get lost!

224
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:49,035
He'll see our faces.

225
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,867
Hi! How are you?

226
00:13:54,005 --> 00:13:56,007
I could shoot you.

227
00:13:56,145 --> 00:13:58,044
I really wish that
you wouldn't do that.

228
00:13:58,182 --> 00:14:00,046
And I know that this
is private property.

229
00:14:00,184 --> 00:14:01,185
Our bank actually holds it

230
00:14:01,323 --> 00:14:03,463
until we can get
these papers signed.

231
00:14:03,601 --> 00:14:05,258
My associate and I
would love to speak

232
00:14:05,396 --> 00:14:06,017
with the Trammels.

233
00:14:06,155 --> 00:14:07,432
Are they in, mister...

234
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,193
They ain't here yet. I'm Daniel.

235
00:14:09,331 --> 00:14:10,850
Oh, you're the caretaker!

236
00:14:10,988 --> 00:14:13,473
Yeah, yeah, I see
that you've been very...

237
00:14:13,611 --> 00:14:14,612
...busy.

238
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,234
That's the gardener's job.

239
00:14:16,372 --> 00:14:19,755
Mostly I watch rodents.
Set traps.

240
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:21,826
Well, we would really love
to get these signed

241
00:14:21,964 --> 00:14:23,690
before habitation
can be finalized.

242
00:14:23,828 --> 00:14:26,900
Do you know when the family
will be arriving?

243
00:14:29,558 --> 00:14:31,871
Do you live on the premises?

244
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:33,803
Shack out back.
But I got evicted.

245
00:14:33,942 --> 00:14:37,773
Bank would have known
about that, wouldn't they?

246
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:40,396
Different bank,
different assets.

247
00:14:40,534 --> 00:14:41,811
Listen, you've been
extremely helpful.

248
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,434
I'm gonna let
you get back to it.

249
00:14:43,572 --> 00:14:46,402
Don't you need to talk
to Mr. Trammel?

250
00:14:47,369 --> 00:14:48,542
Drive.

251
00:15:07,354 --> 00:15:08,355
Coats.

252
00:15:08,493 --> 00:15:10,461
We forgot coats.

253
00:15:10,599 --> 00:15:13,257
Don't be a tourist.

254
00:15:53,849 --> 00:15:55,333
Can we get through this?

255
00:15:55,471 --> 00:15:58,233
Not without a blowtorch.

256
00:16:00,304 --> 00:16:02,478
What if we break a window?

257
00:16:02,616 --> 00:16:04,308
What if I slice my hand open?

258
00:16:04,446 --> 00:16:05,792
Do you know first aid?

259
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,968
No. But Siri does.

260
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,628
There's a basement
around the corner.

261
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:24,328
Watch my back.

262
00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:44,382
Daniel?

263
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,867
I don't know.

264
00:17:03,712 --> 00:17:09,166
Behold
the horror of Halton House.

265
00:17:12,617 --> 00:17:14,447
- Dude.
- Yeah?

266
00:17:14,585 --> 00:17:16,897
Where's my bag?

267
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,522
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

268
00:18:51,854 --> 00:18:54,374
- Hey!
- Jesus Christ!

269
00:18:54,512 --> 00:18:56,376
Uh, got the bags.

270
00:18:56,514 --> 00:18:59,138
Don't do that.

271
00:18:59,276 --> 00:19:01,209
Lots of space down here.

272
00:19:01,347 --> 00:19:03,349
Lots of places to hide.

273
00:19:03,487 --> 00:19:05,040
Possible home base?

274
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:06,731
No.

275
00:19:06,869 --> 00:19:08,802
What do you think
is in those boxes?

276
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,322
Adelaide's fine China.

277
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,222
Halton House swag
could be valuable.

278
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,913
We're not thieves!

279
00:19:16,051 --> 00:19:17,017
Okay. Yeah.

280
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,573
Rule number two.
I was testing you.

281
00:19:20,711 --> 00:19:23,645
Okay. Let's go this way.
Come on.

282
00:20:25,327 --> 00:20:29,952
Oh,
that's some Phantom Opera shit.

283
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:40,653
Laura, check it out.

284
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,931
Hold my calls.

285
00:20:45,451 --> 00:20:46,624
Focus.

286
00:20:46,762 --> 00:20:48,764
We don't have that much time.

287
00:20:48,902 --> 00:20:50,525
Actually, you know what?
Go find some linen.

288
00:20:50,663 --> 00:20:52,009
I'm gonna find a place
for us to hide.

289
00:20:52,147 --> 00:20:53,528
Meet back here in five minutes.

290
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:56,427
Wait. You wanna split up?

291
00:20:56,565 --> 00:20:58,671
In the haunted mansion.

292
00:20:58,809 --> 00:21:01,052
Are you sure that's a good idea?

293
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:04,124
Have you ever seen Scooby-Doo?

294
00:21:11,753 --> 00:21:13,410
It's just the house settling.

295
00:21:13,548 --> 00:21:15,688
That's not settling.

296
00:21:15,826 --> 00:21:17,172
Okay. Okay.

297
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:20,796
Blankets. Sir, yes, sir.

298
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,876
Vin, what happened?

299
00:23:17,223 --> 00:23:19,708
Howdy there, partners.

300
00:23:19,846 --> 00:23:21,779
What?
You two surprised to see me?

301
00:23:21,917 --> 00:23:23,263
It's okay, 'cause I'm surprised
to see you, too.

302
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,851
'Cause last I remember,
it was all,

303
00:23:24,989 --> 00:23:26,957
"Let's just let this one go,
Adrian.

304
00:23:27,095 --> 00:23:29,028
It's not worth ending
our partnership, Adrian."

305
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:30,926
You can't be here, Adrian.

306
00:23:31,064 --> 00:23:32,928
Yeah, well, here I am, so...

307
00:23:33,066 --> 00:23:34,965
You're gonna get us caught?

308
00:23:35,103 --> 00:23:36,207
Burn the house down.
What is this?

309
00:23:36,345 --> 00:23:38,624
Wait. It's scented. It--

310
00:23:39,763 --> 00:23:41,696
The place smells
like a rat toilet.

311
00:23:41,834 --> 00:23:43,456
It'll air itself out
by tomorrow.

312
00:23:43,594 --> 00:23:45,458
They're coming tonight.

313
00:23:45,596 --> 00:23:46,804
Sweet.

314
00:23:46,942 --> 00:23:48,461
Let's just go.

315
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:50,567
Plan's fucked.

316
00:23:50,705 --> 00:23:52,810
Boyfriend still thinks
this is a hobby.

317
00:23:52,948 --> 00:23:54,536
Doesn't get that he's a hobby.

318
00:23:54,674 --> 00:23:56,124
Okay, no.
You can't pull that crap.

319
00:23:56,262 --> 00:23:57,056
Not here.

320
00:23:57,194 --> 00:23:58,264
And you're the bitch who lied.

321
00:23:58,402 --> 00:24:00,128
You brought this fuckin'
asshole to Halton House.

322
00:24:00,266 --> 00:24:02,682
It was my fuckin' lead. My f--

323
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,305
Oh, no, you two, stop!
Stop! Stop!

324
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,791
Enough! Stop!

325
00:24:07,929 --> 00:24:09,275
They're here.

326
00:24:13,935 --> 00:24:16,351
Here. Careful.

327
00:24:16,489 --> 00:24:18,146
Careful, honey.

328
00:24:18,284 --> 00:24:21,460
It's bigger when you own it.

329
00:24:23,151 --> 00:24:24,255
Spookier, too.

330
00:24:26,188 --> 00:24:29,122
- We did it.
- Oh, my gosh.

331
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:32,056
Just needs some light.

332
00:24:32,194 --> 00:24:33,368
Oh, Pete.

333
00:24:33,506 --> 00:24:36,302
You-- you've gotta go slow
with her.

334
00:24:38,028 --> 00:24:40,548
Damn light.

335
00:24:41,031 --> 00:24:44,137
Old world charm.

336
00:24:45,345 --> 00:24:47,486
And fixtures.

337
00:24:48,348 --> 00:24:51,006
Why don't we just get a hotel
for the night?

338
00:24:51,144 --> 00:24:54,665
No reason to force it,
just to say we're moved in.

339
00:24:54,803 --> 00:24:57,737
No, no, no.
That's just one switch.

340
00:24:57,875 --> 00:24:59,705
Must be
a lamp around here somewhere.

341
00:24:59,843 --> 00:25:03,709
Vin, where is your bag?

342
00:25:03,847 --> 00:25:05,849
Oh, fuck!

343
00:25:06,884 --> 00:25:09,715
A light.

344
00:25:09,853 --> 00:25:12,890
Just one light.

345
00:25:13,028 --> 00:25:15,099
Just one fuckin' light.

346
00:25:15,237 --> 00:25:17,999
Save me the price of a hotel.

347
00:25:18,137 --> 00:25:20,519
And bedbugs.

348
00:25:21,071 --> 00:25:23,314
Sammy, go home.

349
00:25:23,452 --> 00:25:26,179
Oh, Sam.

350
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:29,976
See, Daddy Pete and I
bought this house.

351
00:25:30,114 --> 00:25:33,014
This is our home now.

352
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,572
If they find that bag,
we're blown.

353
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:40,815
Then let's leave.

354
00:25:46,855 --> 00:25:48,892
You're just
the flavor of the month, bro.

355
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:51,342
That girl's heart
belongs to Mr. Wattley.

356
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,690
Hide. Fuckin' hide.

357
00:26:07,773 --> 00:26:10,914
Oh, what's this?

358
00:26:13,537 --> 00:26:16,851
Jesus!
There's no electricity at all?

359
00:26:16,989 --> 00:26:18,646
I thought you checked that.

360
00:26:18,784 --> 00:26:20,337
I did check, Megan.

361
00:26:20,475 --> 00:26:21,476
The guy told me he was--

362
00:26:21,614 --> 00:26:23,271
There's no reason to yell.

363
00:26:23,409 --> 00:26:24,721
Or call me Megan.

364
00:26:24,859 --> 00:26:26,895
Okay, Meg.

365
00:26:27,033 --> 00:26:29,415
Thanks for clearing that up.

366
00:26:29,553 --> 00:26:31,037
It's been a long ride,

367
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:33,350
and I-- I just wanna
get us moved in.

368
00:26:33,488 --> 00:26:35,594
The next payment on the house
is contingent upon me being--

369
00:26:35,732 --> 00:26:37,147
The-- the advance. The book.
I get it.

370
00:26:37,285 --> 00:26:41,289
Just, please find the fuse box
so the girl can charge her iPad.

371
00:26:41,427 --> 00:26:44,154
Hey, okay, I'll-- I'll try.

372
00:26:44,292 --> 00:26:46,259
Thank you.

373
00:27:26,161 --> 00:27:28,681
Hello?

374
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,483
Goodnight, iPad. iPad all done.

375
00:27:37,621 --> 00:27:38,829
Charger, please.

376
00:27:38,967 --> 00:27:41,176
Oh, it's in the car.

377
00:27:41,314 --> 00:27:42,074
Not that we have--

378
00:27:42,212 --> 00:27:45,664
Charger, please. Thank you.

379
00:27:48,425 --> 00:27:51,911
Just stay here, okay?
Be right back.

380
00:28:13,277 --> 00:28:16,729
Ugh! Rats?

381
00:28:16,867 --> 00:28:18,489
Shit!

382
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:42,203
Honey?

383
00:28:46,552 --> 00:28:50,452
Honey? Everything okay?

384
00:28:51,453 --> 00:28:53,007
What do you see?

385
00:28:53,145 --> 00:28:57,114
Go home. Go home.

386
00:29:01,256 --> 00:29:03,949
Let there be light.

387
00:29:05,882 --> 00:29:09,126
Oh! There we go!

388
00:29:13,682 --> 00:29:14,476
My hero.

389
00:29:16,547 --> 00:29:18,722
You want to open up a bottle?

390
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:21,276
Oh, well,
we've got a long day tomorrow.

391
00:29:21,414 --> 00:29:25,073
The truck will
be here in a few hours.

392
00:29:40,882 --> 00:29:43,816
We'll set the cameras tomorrow.

393
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:45,645
Maybe if we're lucky,

394
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:49,270
they'll leave
for a couple of hours.

395
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,860
What about Adrian?

396
00:29:52,998 --> 00:29:54,827
It's a big enough house.

397
00:29:54,965 --> 00:29:58,106
It's probably
a three-person job, anyway.

398
00:29:58,935 --> 00:30:00,591
Laura, he's dangerous.

399
00:30:00,729 --> 00:30:03,491
I can handle Adrian.

400
00:30:11,671 --> 00:30:14,571
Don't make a sound.

401
00:32:30,155 --> 00:32:31,156
Hi!

402
00:32:31,294 --> 00:32:32,985
Hola! Uh, um, hi.

403
00:32:33,123 --> 00:32:35,643
Um, he says he won't go in.

404
00:32:35,781 --> 00:32:39,819
He, uh, didn't know
it was this house.

405
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:43,271
Um, we paid you
to take the furniture

406
00:32:43,409 --> 00:32:46,171
in the house, not the--
the driveway.

407
00:32:46,309 --> 00:32:47,862
Yeah, um, I'll--
I'll talk to him.

408
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,037
Um, sorry.

409
00:33:12,818 --> 00:33:15,821
Looks like I missed the party.

410
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:18,099
Are you trying
to burn the house down

411
00:33:18,237 --> 00:33:21,102
before we can even move in?

412
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,208
What?

413
00:33:23,725 --> 00:33:26,245
Th-- this moving guy you hired
won't come in.

414
00:33:26,383 --> 00:33:29,835
They're dumping all the stuff
in the driveway.

415
00:33:32,182 --> 00:33:35,565
What the hell is a Halton house?

416
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:38,740
Is this where the advance you're
talking about is coming from?

417
00:33:38,878 --> 00:33:43,918
Baby, it's not what you think.

418
00:33:46,265 --> 00:33:48,888
I-- I thought we moved here
for Sam.

419
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,546
For the school.

420
00:33:52,202 --> 00:33:53,859
Schools don't come cheap.

421
00:33:53,997 --> 00:33:57,104
I-- I thought you were done
with this stuff.

422
00:33:57,242 --> 00:33:58,553
This weird stuff.

423
00:33:58,691 --> 00:34:00,383
The sensationalism.

424
00:34:00,521 --> 00:34:03,627
You lost your last family to it.

425
00:34:03,765 --> 00:34:05,457
You don't know anything
about that.

426
00:34:05,595 --> 00:34:09,081
What-- what happened
to writing novels?

427
00:34:09,219 --> 00:34:11,014
To teaching?

428
00:34:11,152 --> 00:34:14,431
Adjunct teaching salaries
don't--

429
00:34:14,569 --> 00:34:17,400
Don't pay for special schools
and-- and therapies.

430
00:34:17,538 --> 00:34:19,471
Novels?

431
00:34:19,609 --> 00:34:23,440
They wouldn't pay for the taxes
on public schools.

432
00:34:23,578 --> 00:34:26,271
Right, let me see
about the movers.

433
00:34:54,299 --> 00:34:55,265
Why aren't you in the room?

434
00:34:55,403 --> 00:34:56,370
Why aren't you in the room?

435
00:34:56,508 --> 00:34:57,854
I was lookin' for you.

436
00:34:57,992 --> 00:34:58,958
I heard noises outside.

437
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,477
The movers are here.

438
00:35:00,615 --> 00:35:02,755
Oh.

439
00:35:03,515 --> 00:35:05,448
She's been doing this
all morning.

440
00:35:05,586 --> 00:35:07,484
I think she's on the spectrum
or something.

441
00:35:07,622 --> 00:35:09,590
What, are you
a clinical psychiatrist now?

442
00:35:09,728 --> 00:35:12,869
No. My brother.

443
00:35:13,007 --> 00:35:16,079
We didn't find out
till he was older.

444
00:35:16,217 --> 00:35:18,323
He used to drive my dad crazy.

445
00:35:18,461 --> 00:35:20,221
But it's not his fault.

446
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:22,879
He didn't know.

447
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,852
Look, I don't think we
should mess with her.

448
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:33,648
It wouldn't be right.

449
00:35:33,786 --> 00:35:35,685
Or very sporting, at least.

450
00:35:35,823 --> 00:35:37,687
We're not here to hurt anyone.

451
00:35:37,825 --> 00:35:39,965
At best, we're here to give them
a sense of something bigger

452
00:35:40,103 --> 00:35:41,967
in the world.

453
00:35:42,105 --> 00:35:44,556
Mr. Wattley says
that that's the point.

454
00:35:44,694 --> 00:35:47,006
Being a part of
something bigger.

455
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,388
Something mysterious.

456
00:35:49,526 --> 00:35:51,666
Dangerous.

457
00:35:51,804 --> 00:35:53,875
Feeling alive.

458
00:35:54,013 --> 00:35:56,257
We all need a little
reminder of that sometimes.

459
00:35:56,395 --> 00:35:58,880
Yeah.

460
00:36:08,338 --> 00:36:11,307
Oh, shit.

461
00:36:11,445 --> 00:36:13,309
The kid?

462
00:36:13,447 --> 00:36:15,897
No, no, I've been watching her.

463
00:36:20,316 --> 00:36:23,457
Our phones are missing.

464
00:36:23,595 --> 00:36:25,942
Adrian.

465
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,358
Damn it.

466
00:36:29,911 --> 00:36:31,568
What if I give you both
an extra 50?

467
00:36:31,706 --> 00:36:33,467
He saw somethin' in the window.

468
00:36:33,605 --> 00:36:38,161
He keeps sayin' "bruja"
and "phantamos".

469
00:36:38,299 --> 00:36:40,163
It's not a bruja. It's Sam.

470
00:36:40,301 --> 00:36:41,337
- Alright.
- It's my stepdaughter.

471
00:36:41,475 --> 00:36:44,167
Alright, sir. I'm sorry.
We can't help you.

472
00:36:44,305 --> 00:36:46,204
Guys!

473
00:36:48,585 --> 00:36:50,208
The-- the caretaker isn't here.

474
00:36:50,346 --> 00:36:51,899
It looks like he cleared out.

475
00:36:52,037 --> 00:36:54,073
He-- he was supposed to stay
through the week.

476
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:57,698
His truck's gone.
I texted him twice.

477
00:36:59,527 --> 00:37:01,426
Come on.

478
00:37:01,564 --> 00:37:03,151
Let's go. You and me.

479
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:04,739
You-- you look ready to puke.

480
00:37:04,877 --> 00:37:08,156
It's just-- can we get it done?
Please?

481
00:37:08,295 --> 00:37:10,538
Alright.
Just please watch your back.

482
00:37:10,676 --> 00:37:12,402
I got it.

483
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:48,058
Hey. What's up?

484
00:37:48,196 --> 00:37:49,474
You want some?

485
00:37:49,612 --> 00:37:51,234
- Give me the phones.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

486
00:37:51,372 --> 00:37:53,926
Don't fuckin' touch my shit.

487
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:55,652
I didn't take your phones.

488
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:58,483
Probably just lost 'em.

489
00:37:58,621 --> 00:38:00,519
I have a system.

490
00:38:00,657 --> 00:38:03,004
Maybe Vin's new little buddy
took 'em.

491
00:38:03,142 --> 00:38:06,007
The creepy kid.

492
00:38:07,561 --> 00:38:11,116
And I suppose you didn't start
that fire last night.

493
00:38:11,254 --> 00:38:13,463
I didn't do shit last night.

494
00:38:13,601 --> 00:38:15,154
I was up here.

495
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,709
Sticking to your plan.

496
00:38:17,847 --> 00:38:19,780
I mean,
I might have rubbed one out,

497
00:38:19,918 --> 00:38:21,609
if you wanna know the truth.

498
00:38:21,747 --> 00:38:22,645
Maybe two.

499
00:38:22,783 --> 00:38:25,820
Not to brag.

500
00:38:26,959 --> 00:38:28,547
I won't let you
mess this one up.

501
00:38:28,685 --> 00:38:30,411
Oh, you mean like last time
when you fucked everything up?

502
00:38:30,549 --> 00:38:32,240
Only because you went off plan.

503
00:38:32,379 --> 00:38:33,863
Huh, yeah.

504
00:38:34,001 --> 00:38:36,590
And here I was about to share
my lucky charms with you.

505
00:38:36,728 --> 00:38:38,695
That kid is wandering around
unsupervised,

506
00:38:38,833 --> 00:38:40,732
so we should
probably just wait.

507
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:42,112
You know, for a girl

508
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:45,323
who likes to break
into people's houses for kicks,

509
00:38:45,461 --> 00:38:48,153
you had a real
stick up your ass.

510
00:39:40,205 --> 00:39:42,656
Sam,
don't use too much hot water.

511
00:39:42,794 --> 00:39:43,795
Your mom's getting in next.

512
00:39:43,933 --> 00:39:46,522
You've been in long enough.

513
00:41:18,406 --> 00:41:20,719
Honey?

514
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:33,732
Adrian?

515
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:44,502
What's in here?

516
00:41:55,029 --> 00:41:57,342
His daughter
went missing years ago.

517
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,827
The UFO Girl.

518
00:41:59,965 --> 00:42:02,002
Yeah. I kinda remember it.

519
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:04,349
She went missing and then

520
00:42:04,487 --> 00:42:06,489
she walked out of the woods
or something.

521
00:42:06,627 --> 00:42:11,390
Yeah, she said she was abducted
by aliens.

522
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,290
Can you please stop pacing?
They're gonna hear you.

523
00:42:14,428 --> 00:42:16,879
Sit down.

524
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:22,540
Anyway, his ex-wife said that
he actually just had her hiding

525
00:42:22,678 --> 00:42:26,198
in some rented cabin
or something like that.

526
00:42:26,336 --> 00:42:28,269
There was a messy divorce,

527
00:42:28,407 --> 00:42:31,894
fraud charges, yada yada yada.

528
00:42:32,032 --> 00:42:34,068
Now he's back.

529
00:42:34,206 --> 00:42:36,623
New wife. New kid.

530
00:42:36,761 --> 00:42:39,280
Same old piece of shit.

531
00:42:39,418 --> 00:42:40,627
Wait.

532
00:42:40,765 --> 00:42:42,560
You knew all this before?

533
00:42:42,698 --> 00:42:43,768
Yeah.

534
00:42:43,906 --> 00:42:46,702
I Googled the names
on the deed, didn't you?

535
00:42:49,049 --> 00:42:51,707
Stickin' it to some ex-con man.

536
00:42:51,845 --> 00:42:54,019
Makes this one extra sweet, huh?

537
00:42:54,157 --> 00:42:58,127
Hey. Miss me?

538
00:42:58,265 --> 00:43:00,992
You know, uh,
I know you went through my shit.

539
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:03,615
I didn't touch
your fucking stuff.

540
00:43:03,753 --> 00:43:05,168
We need our phones back.

541
00:43:05,306 --> 00:43:07,930
Well, I don't have 'em, Vinny.

542
00:43:08,068 --> 00:43:10,311
you know, maybe
it's better this way.

543
00:43:10,449 --> 00:43:13,798
Sometimes when you have
a safety net, you lose focus,

544
00:43:13,936 --> 00:43:15,696
make mistakes,

545
00:43:15,834 --> 00:43:17,974
break the rules.

546
00:43:18,112 --> 00:43:20,701
Ain't that right, Laura?

547
00:43:21,081 --> 00:43:23,255
Yeah.

548
00:43:23,393 --> 00:43:26,293
Don't fuckin' touch my shit.

549
00:44:12,891 --> 00:44:14,893
Sam?

550
00:44:30,598 --> 00:44:32,911
Hello?

551
00:44:50,895 --> 00:44:53,138
Pete?

552
00:45:41,566 --> 00:45:44,914
What is this? UFO Girl 2.0?

553
00:45:45,052 --> 00:45:46,467
Like I got nothin' better to do?

554
00:45:46,605 --> 00:45:47,745
Someone did this.

555
00:45:47,883 --> 00:45:50,230
It wasn't me.

556
00:45:50,368 --> 00:45:51,438
I'll call Daniel.

557
00:45:51,576 --> 00:45:52,473
I called Daniel.

558
00:45:52,611 --> 00:45:53,820
I've been calling him all day!

559
00:45:53,958 --> 00:45:56,374
Fine. I'll get an exterminator.

560
00:45:56,512 --> 00:45:57,789
We don't need an exterminator.

561
00:45:57,927 --> 00:45:59,618
The rats are dead!

562
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,897
Well, what do you want me to do?

563
00:46:02,035 --> 00:46:04,727
My daughter is not sleeping
in this house.

564
00:46:04,865 --> 00:46:06,142
Damn it, Meg!

565
00:46:07,592 --> 00:46:09,801
We can't afford a fucking hotel
and room service.

566
00:46:09,939 --> 00:46:11,941
This is the only plan.

567
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:14,323
Not my plan. Come on, Sam.

568
00:46:14,461 --> 00:46:18,154
Oh, honey, where--
where are the keys?

569
00:46:19,155 --> 00:46:21,606
Sammy, were you playing
with mommy's keys?

570
00:46:21,744 --> 00:46:22,883
Hey, I'm talking to you.

571
00:46:23,021 --> 00:46:23,919
Hey, hey!

572
00:46:24,057 --> 00:46:25,299
Take your hands
out of your ears!

573
00:46:25,437 --> 00:46:26,680
Pete.

574
00:46:26,818 --> 00:46:28,544
She understands.
Don't you, kiddo?

575
00:46:28,682 --> 00:46:30,442
Go home. Go home.

576
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:34,205
Where are the goddamn keys?

577
00:46:34,343 --> 00:46:36,655
What the hell?

578
00:46:53,672 --> 00:46:55,847
Go home. Go home.

579
00:46:55,985 --> 00:46:57,711
Go home.

580
00:47:03,682 --> 00:47:06,927
Pete! What is happening?

581
00:47:12,346 --> 00:47:14,314
Jesus.

582
00:47:16,419 --> 00:47:18,870
What's wrong with you?

583
00:47:20,803 --> 00:47:22,943
Why did you do this, huh?

584
00:47:23,081 --> 00:47:25,912
Do this? Do this?

585
00:47:31,262 --> 00:47:32,194
This isn't a joke.

586
00:47:32,332 --> 00:47:34,058
Do you understand? Huh?

587
00:47:34,196 --> 00:47:35,542
She didn't do this.

588
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:36,715
Then who did it?

589
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:39,926
I don't know. Bad pipes.

590
00:47:40,305 --> 00:47:43,343
Pipes.

591
00:47:43,895 --> 00:47:45,448
Why are you doin' this?
It's not part of the plan.

592
00:47:45,586 --> 00:47:47,968
You think--
you really think I did this?

593
00:47:48,106 --> 00:47:49,556
I can barely unclog
a fucking toilet.

594
00:47:49,694 --> 00:47:51,213
It's this guy.
It's this fuckin' prick.

595
00:47:51,351 --> 00:47:52,904
He's up to those
old tricks again.

596
00:47:53,042 --> 00:47:54,147
But why?

597
00:47:54,285 --> 00:47:56,045
It's not like
there's fuckin' press here.

598
00:47:56,183 --> 00:47:58,220
Well, he certainly
got his wife's attention.

599
00:47:58,358 --> 00:48:00,636
Right?

600
00:48:00,774 --> 00:48:04,674
We need to entertain
the obvious explanation.

601
00:48:04,812 --> 00:48:05,572
It's Halton House.

602
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:06,918
Oh, fuck off. Fuck it, man.

603
00:48:07,056 --> 00:48:08,333
What if the rumors are true?

604
00:48:08,471 --> 00:48:10,059
Why'd you bring a goddamn
tourist in a house like this?

605
00:48:15,271 --> 00:48:17,515
This is a bad situation.

606
00:48:17,653 --> 00:48:20,173
The kid. The drinking.

607
00:48:20,311 --> 00:48:21,829
The shotgun on top
of the fuckin' fireplace.

608
00:48:21,968 --> 00:48:23,452
Your boyfriend's Dr. Phil-ing.
You hear this shit?

609
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:25,626
I've seen this shit before.
I know how it ends.

610
00:48:25,764 --> 00:48:27,076
What the fuck are you even--

611
00:48:27,214 --> 00:48:28,664
Okay, okay, okay.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

612
00:48:28,802 --> 00:48:31,287
Shh! Look at me. We are ghosts.

613
00:48:31,425 --> 00:48:32,944
We are not social workers.
We don't get involved.

614
00:48:33,082 --> 00:48:35,119
Listen to yourself.

615
00:48:35,257 --> 00:48:36,914
Ghost Game isn't a thing.

616
00:48:37,052 --> 00:48:38,053
You're just fuckin'
home invaders.

617
00:48:38,191 --> 00:48:41,401
Hey, look at me!
We don't get involved.

618
00:48:41,539 --> 00:48:42,609
Do you hear me?

619
00:48:42,747 --> 00:48:45,646
Nod that you hear me.
Nod your head yes.

620
00:48:45,784 --> 00:48:47,234
Yeah, good luck with that one,
Laura.

621
00:48:48,442 --> 00:48:49,650
That's my cue.

622
00:48:49,788 --> 00:48:50,617
Okay, just give it--
give it ten minutes, Adrian.

623
00:48:50,755 --> 00:48:52,067
Fuck you, Laura.

624
00:48:52,205 --> 00:48:52,619
He's probably still downstairs
with the buckets. I--

625
00:48:52,757 --> 00:48:54,414
Fuck you, Laura.

626
00:48:55,622 --> 00:48:56,795
Fuck, okay.

627
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:57,486
This whole thing is
gettin' out of control.

628
00:48:57,624 --> 00:49:00,627
Okay. Plan. Plan up.

629
00:49:00,765 --> 00:49:02,008
Alright.

630
00:49:02,146 --> 00:49:03,802
You're on the second floor.
You know the plan.

631
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:05,011
What about giving it
ten minutes?

632
00:49:05,149 --> 00:49:06,805
Just don't use any flashlights.

633
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,152
Put all the cameras
in night vision.

634
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:09,739
Put them high enough
that they stay out of sight.

635
00:49:09,877 --> 00:49:10,775
And be sure that you--

636
00:49:10,913 --> 00:49:11,983
- Angle them down.
- Angle them down.

637
00:49:12,121 --> 00:49:16,125
Yeah.
Doesn't exactly take Spielberg.

638
00:50:46,077 --> 00:50:48,666
Hey.

639
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,574
I told you to angle 'em down.

640
00:51:00,712 --> 00:51:03,301
We're barely getting the floor.

641
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:06,649
Wait, wait, wait.

642
00:51:06,787 --> 00:51:08,651
There's only eight cameras.

643
00:51:08,789 --> 00:51:10,412
Where's Adrian's?

644
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:12,379
I don't know.
Adrian's bein' Adrian.

645
00:51:12,517 --> 00:51:14,554
He's probably going through
the mom's panty drawer

646
00:51:14,692 --> 00:51:15,934
or something.

647
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:18,868
Or practicing stylist skills.

648
00:51:19,006 --> 00:51:21,078
What happened to
no interference?

649
00:51:21,216 --> 00:51:22,976
What happened to
Mr. Wattley's rules?

650
00:51:23,114 --> 00:51:25,979
I've tried.
Lord knows have I tried.

651
00:51:26,117 --> 00:51:28,154
That boy is his own worst enemy.

652
00:51:28,292 --> 00:51:31,467
Even the community
wants him excommunicated.

653
00:51:33,987 --> 00:51:36,162
Are you sure she didn't see you?

654
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:37,335
What?

655
00:51:37,473 --> 00:51:39,544
No. No. No.

656
00:51:39,682 --> 00:51:40,787
Definitely not.

657
00:51:40,925 --> 00:51:43,997
I don't think you have
to worry about Sam.

658
00:51:44,135 --> 00:51:46,241
Okay.

659
00:51:46,379 --> 00:51:48,243
Okay, we'll move those cameras
in the morning.

660
00:51:48,381 --> 00:51:51,418
Before she tells her parents.

661
00:51:57,838 --> 00:51:59,840
Is this place normal?

662
00:52:02,188 --> 00:52:03,603
It's never normal.

663
00:52:03,741 --> 00:52:06,882
That's the point.

664
00:53:56,612 --> 00:53:58,959
Laura?

665
00:54:00,858 --> 00:54:01,721
You want me, bitch, fuck--

666
00:54:32,545 --> 00:54:33,787
Hey.

667
00:54:33,925 --> 00:54:35,548
Hmm.

668
00:54:35,686 --> 00:54:37,998
- Hey.
- Hmm.

669
00:54:38,136 --> 00:54:41,139
You hear that?

670
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:06,648
What the fuck?

671
00:55:06,786 --> 00:55:09,444
Fuckin' Adrian.

672
00:55:12,826 --> 00:55:13,896
- Hey, hey.
- What?

673
00:55:14,034 --> 00:55:15,484
You can't go out there.

674
00:55:15,622 --> 00:55:16,796
Ghosts won't go out
in the morning.

675
00:55:16,934 --> 00:55:18,384
Well, they do
if they're about to get caught.

676
00:55:18,522 --> 00:55:20,489
We need to move those cameras
before everybody else wakes up.

677
00:55:20,627 --> 00:55:22,008
Then I'm gonna find
that fuckin' asshole

678
00:55:22,146 --> 00:55:22,974
and deal with him myself.

679
00:55:23,112 --> 00:55:23,527
- Hey, hey.
- What?

680
00:55:23,665 --> 00:55:25,460
Wait.

681
00:55:25,598 --> 00:55:28,532
What if this wasn't Adrian?

682
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:32,536
Will you please shut up?

683
00:56:27,418 --> 00:56:29,109
You still in London?

684
00:56:29,247 --> 00:56:33,424
Paris. Oh, nice. Lucky you.

685
00:56:33,562 --> 00:56:34,736
Yeah.

686
00:56:34,874 --> 00:56:38,602
I still haven't gotten
the check.

687
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:41,398
I'm working right now.
Writing every night.

688
00:56:41,536 --> 00:56:42,640
Wait till you see the pictures.

689
00:56:42,778 --> 00:56:45,402
Those weirdo fucks are gonna
eat this shit up.

690
00:56:48,819 --> 00:56:52,132
Tomorrow? That's quick.

691
00:56:52,270 --> 00:56:55,481
I was thinking next week.

692
00:56:55,619 --> 00:56:57,862
Uh, I thought this was
a done deal.

693
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,071
I have bills.

694
00:57:00,209 --> 00:57:02,902
What about
the reality show people?

695
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,214
I know. I know.

696
00:57:05,352 --> 00:57:07,147
That book cost all of us.

697
00:57:07,285 --> 00:57:10,737
But I'm doing this
one the right way.

698
00:57:10,875 --> 00:57:13,464
Nigel?

699
00:57:13,602 --> 00:57:16,502
Nigel?

700
00:57:20,644 --> 00:57:22,749
Dammit!

701
00:57:23,647 --> 00:57:26,132
Yup. He bailed.

702
00:57:28,479 --> 00:57:33,208
His keys.
His wallet. His cameras.

703
00:57:33,346 --> 00:57:34,761
Adrian mows lawns for a living.

704
00:57:34,899 --> 00:57:38,834
He's not exactly swimming
in disposable income.

705
00:57:40,836 --> 00:57:42,148
Maybe-- maybe the basement?

706
00:57:42,286 --> 00:57:45,358
No, I checked the basement.

707
00:57:45,496 --> 00:57:47,498
Laura, what are we doin' here?

708
00:57:47,636 --> 00:57:49,293
Riskin' our life for--
for cheap thrills

709
00:57:49,431 --> 00:57:51,571
like some fuckin' teenagers!

710
00:57:51,709 --> 00:57:53,677
Yeah, well, this was a mistake.

711
00:57:53,815 --> 00:57:56,231
Yes, exactly.

712
00:57:56,369 --> 00:57:58,198
It's a mistake.
And we can fix it.

713
00:57:58,336 --> 00:58:02,168
No. I meant you. Us.

714
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,895
We started as a Tinder hookup,

715
00:58:05,033 --> 00:58:06,483
and you immediately
quit your job,

716
00:58:06,621 --> 00:58:08,001
and moved into my apartment.

717
00:58:08,139 --> 00:58:11,453
You started spying
on my computer.

718
00:58:11,591 --> 00:58:14,560
Adrian's not
the only one unhinged here.

719
00:58:14,698 --> 00:58:16,423
I thought
we were past this shit.

720
00:58:16,562 --> 00:58:19,081
You knew I wasn't spying on you.

721
00:58:19,219 --> 00:58:20,531
But you know what, Laura?

722
00:58:20,669 --> 00:58:21,946
I'm done.

723
00:58:22,084 --> 00:58:23,603
Tonight, I'm gone.

724
00:58:23,741 --> 00:58:27,711
I'm done playing second fiddle
to the great Mr. Wattley.

It's time to go.

737
00:59:27,218 --> 00:59:30,394
I know you probably
won't understand at first.

738
00:59:30,532 --> 00:59:35,572
But eventually, you'll realize
I'm doing this for us.

739
00:59:41,854 --> 00:59:44,408
What is this?

740
00:59:46,617 --> 00:59:47,963
You fuckwit!

741
00:59:48,101 --> 00:59:49,378
I can't pretend
like I don't care.

742
00:59:49,516 --> 00:59:50,794
- Who do you think you are? Huh?
- You're a fuckin' idiot!

743
00:59:53,279 --> 00:59:55,661
They're still awake.

744
00:59:55,799 --> 00:59:57,455
God.

745
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:00,389
You're more
than this fucking game.

746
01:00:00,527 --> 01:00:03,254
Game?

747
01:00:03,392 --> 01:00:05,084
What do you know, huh?

748
01:00:05,222 --> 01:00:08,432
I work at a damn call center.

749
01:00:16,854 --> 01:00:19,616
I used to do wild shit.

750
01:00:19,754 --> 01:00:20,824
Every night was a ride.

751
01:00:20,962 --> 01:00:24,448
College couldn't contain me,
you know?

752
01:00:24,586 --> 01:00:28,521
But now-- now it's temp work.

753
01:00:28,659 --> 01:00:29,695
Lean Cuisine dinners

754
01:00:29,833 --> 01:00:32,525
and I'm binge-watching
The Office.

755
01:00:32,663 --> 01:00:33,802
Come on, Laura.

756
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:37,426
This? It's over.

757
01:00:39,118 --> 01:00:41,465
No, I got-- I got my laptop.

758
01:00:41,603 --> 01:00:42,811
Still got my camera.

759
01:00:42,949 --> 01:00:43,674
You're fuckin' nuts!

760
01:00:43,812 --> 01:00:44,537
Yeah, I know.

761
01:00:44,675 --> 01:00:45,503
That's already been established.

762
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:48,817
So get the fuck out of my life!

763
01:00:48,955 --> 01:00:50,923
Go out the back door.

764
01:00:51,061 --> 01:00:52,821
Take the long way out.
Don't go past the sitting room.

765
01:00:52,959 --> 01:00:55,652
I'll lock up later.

766
01:00:58,033 --> 01:01:00,380
Fuckin' idiot.

767
01:01:43,492 --> 01:01:46,806
What the fuck?

768
01:02:01,062 --> 01:02:02,201
Where is she?

769
01:02:02,339 --> 01:02:03,961
What?

770
01:02:04,099 --> 01:02:05,583
Your daughter.

771
01:02:07,171 --> 01:02:09,380
Sam?

772
01:02:09,518 --> 01:02:10,796
Sam?

773
01:02:10,934 --> 01:02:13,005
- Where is she?
- Sam?

774
01:02:13,764 --> 01:02:15,766
Honey?

775
01:02:15,904 --> 01:02:17,388
Honey?

776
01:02:17,526 --> 01:02:20,081
Honey, what is it?
What's wrong?

777
01:02:20,219 --> 01:02:23,360
What the fuck have you done?

778
01:02:23,498 --> 01:02:25,742
You think this is a joke? Huh?

779
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,260
To burn things?

780
01:02:27,398 --> 01:02:28,986
To fuck everything up?

781
01:02:29,124 --> 01:02:30,505
You have any idea
what you've done?

782
01:02:30,643 --> 01:02:31,748
No!

783
01:02:33,922 --> 01:02:35,613
Kiki!

784
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:37,098
No! No! No! No! No! No!

785
01:02:37,236 --> 01:02:38,375
No, no, no! No!

786
01:02:38,513 --> 01:02:40,757
How would you like it
if I burn your things?

787
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:42,482
Stop! She's just a kid!

788
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:44,312
Kids need to be taught lessons.

789
01:02:44,450 --> 01:02:46,901
Kiki! I want Kiki! I want Kiki!

790
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:49,420
I wanted my laptop! My writing!

791
01:02:49,558 --> 01:02:52,182
You're drunk! Stop!

792
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,839
You coddle her!

793
01:02:53,977 --> 01:02:55,599
She needs to learn!

794
01:02:55,737 --> 01:02:59,120
I want Kiki! I want Kiki!

795
01:02:59,258 --> 01:03:01,778
Stop!

796
01:03:06,506 --> 01:03:08,577
I'm sorry.

797
01:03:08,715 --> 01:03:10,752
I-- I didn't want to.

798
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:12,409
You came at me.

799
01:03:12,547 --> 01:03:14,238
Don't you touch me!

800
01:03:14,376 --> 01:03:18,001
Go home. Go home.

801
01:03:18,933 --> 01:03:21,349
This is what happens
when you play games!

802
01:03:21,487 --> 01:03:22,902
When you're a bad girl!

803
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:24,179
Let go of the kid!

804
01:03:26,043 --> 01:03:27,251
Who the fuck are you?

805
01:03:27,389 --> 01:03:28,632
Look, look, look.

806
01:03:28,770 --> 01:03:30,772
You--you've had a lot to drink.

807
01:03:30,910 --> 01:03:33,568
Your wife needs
to go to a hospital.

808
01:03:33,706 --> 01:03:36,398
I'ma get 'em out of here.

809
01:03:39,091 --> 01:03:41,783
Let go of the kid! Now!

810
01:03:43,543 --> 01:03:46,650
- Sam!
- Meg, wait!

811
01:03:46,788 --> 01:03:48,963
Did you see?

812
01:03:49,101 --> 01:03:50,619
It was him!

813
01:03:50,757 --> 01:03:52,414
All along screwing with us!

814
01:03:52,552 --> 01:03:56,177
- Let Sam go!
- It wasn't me.

815
01:03:56,315 --> 01:03:58,041
None of this.

816
01:03:58,179 --> 01:04:00,698
This evil fuck!

817
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:03,356
Always trying to screw with me!

818
01:04:03,494 --> 01:04:05,082
Stop!

819
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:09,915
I've done everything I could!

820
01:04:10,053 --> 01:04:13,159
I want Kiki! I want Kiki!

821
01:04:13,297 --> 01:04:14,712
- Run!
- Stay out of this!

822
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,645
- Just run!
- Come. Sam, come on!

823
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:20,304
Sam.

824
01:04:21,374 --> 01:04:22,651
Come on!

825
01:04:22,789 --> 01:04:24,067
Come on!

826
01:04:25,102 --> 01:04:28,519
Sam, it's okay. It's o-- okay.

827
01:04:45,674 --> 01:04:47,849
Hey! Hey! What just happened?

828
01:04:47,987 --> 01:04:49,230
We need to
get the fuck out of here!

829
01:04:49,368 --> 01:04:50,748
Okay, okay, okay. Uh, basement.

830
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:53,441
Let's go to the basement.

831
01:04:53,579 --> 01:04:55,098
They didn't do that.

832
01:04:55,236 --> 01:04:57,238
We didn't do that.

833
01:04:57,376 --> 01:04:59,826
Come on, let's go. Come on.

834
01:05:02,277 --> 01:05:05,280
Fuck! Oh, shit! He locked us in.

835
01:05:10,147 --> 01:05:13,599
I see a light. Maybe it's--

836
01:05:13,737 --> 01:05:14,807
Oh, no. Don't move.

837
01:05:14,945 --> 01:05:17,085
No, no, no, Vin, he's got a gun!

838
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:23,920
Holy shit. Holy shit.

839
01:05:24,713 --> 01:05:25,300
This flashlight.

840
01:05:25,438 --> 01:05:26,784
Okay.

841
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:28,165
- It's-- it's-- it's mine!
- Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

842
01:05:28,303 --> 01:05:29,235
- It's from my bag.
- Okay!

843
01:05:29,373 --> 01:05:30,305
Okay, yeah,
we need to get our stuff

844
01:05:30,443 --> 01:05:31,513
and get out of here.

845
01:05:31,651 --> 01:05:32,204
- Okay, come on.
- We touched everything.

846
01:05:32,342 --> 01:05:33,067
No.

847
01:05:33,205 --> 01:05:34,275
Our fingerprints are everywhere!

848
01:05:34,413 --> 01:05:36,380
- Vin, please. Please, Vin.
- It's a setup.

849
01:05:36,518 --> 01:05:38,486
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, come on. Vin, Please.

850
01:05:38,624 --> 01:05:39,487
I touched the gun!

851
01:05:39,625 --> 01:05:42,007
I touched the gun!

852
01:05:42,145 --> 01:05:44,595
The wife saw my-- saw my face.

853
01:05:44,733 --> 01:05:45,907
Oh, my God.

854
01:05:46,045 --> 01:05:48,945
Sam. Sam. Sam. Sam, Sam, Sam.

855
01:05:49,083 --> 01:05:50,498
Sam, hey, hey.

856
01:05:50,636 --> 01:05:53,328
Sammy go home. Sammy go home!

857
01:05:53,466 --> 01:05:54,191
It's okay.

858
01:05:54,329 --> 01:05:55,606
We're gonna get you out of here.

859
01:05:55,744 --> 01:06:00,370
Sammy go home. Sammy go home.

860
01:06:08,895 --> 01:06:10,242
- That time is--
- Yeah, okay.

861
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:11,691
- It can't be right.
- Okay.

862
01:06:12,865 --> 01:06:16,041
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

863
01:06:16,179 --> 01:06:19,182
You like to watch?

864
01:06:21,356 --> 01:06:23,841
Watch this.

865
01:06:29,433 --> 01:06:30,641
You like that?

866
01:06:40,858 --> 01:06:43,551
Fuckin' Adrian.

867
01:06:43,689 --> 01:06:45,415
No, Adrian wouldn't do this.

868
01:06:45,553 --> 01:06:47,969
He wouldn't do this.

869
01:06:48,107 --> 01:06:51,179
Where else?

870
01:06:51,317 --> 01:06:53,354
Point to it.

871
01:06:53,492 --> 01:06:55,528
Point to it.

872
01:06:55,666 --> 01:06:57,703
That one.

873
01:07:04,089 --> 01:07:05,400
Look out!

874
01:07:13,822 --> 01:07:14,961
Vin.

875
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:16,722
- You okay?
- Yeah.

876
01:07:22,831 --> 01:07:25,006
I'll try to-- try to lift it.

877
01:07:35,810 --> 01:07:37,225
- Can you walk?
- Oh, my God.

878
01:07:37,363 --> 01:07:40,090
I'm not stayin' here.

879
01:07:40,228 --> 01:07:41,264
Okay.

880
01:07:41,402 --> 01:07:42,782
- We need to get the kid.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

881
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:43,749
Yeah, go get her.

882
01:07:43,887 --> 01:07:45,026
Go get her. Okay, go, go, go.

883
01:07:45,164 --> 01:07:47,856
Go, go, go. Go, go.
I got it. I got it. Go.

884
01:07:48,650 --> 01:07:49,513
Hey, hey.

885
01:07:49,651 --> 01:07:51,377
Sammy go home.

886
01:07:56,210 --> 01:07:58,557
Yeah, we're-- we're gonna
get you out of here, okay?

887
01:07:58,695 --> 01:08:03,079
But Kiki's scared
and she needs you to be brave.

888
01:08:03,217 --> 01:08:04,494
Can you be brave?

889
01:08:11,259 --> 01:08:13,089
House all done.

890
01:08:14,262 --> 01:08:16,782
Okay. Okay.

891
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:17,990
Okay, let's go. Come on.

892
01:08:18,128 --> 01:08:19,371
Okay. Okay.
Let's get you out of here.

893
01:08:19,509 --> 01:08:21,545
Come on.

894
01:08:24,686 --> 01:08:28,138
Oh, God! Come on!

895
01:08:33,074 --> 01:08:35,111
Okay. Okay.

896
01:08:35,249 --> 01:08:37,147
If he's inside,
there's definitely a way.

897
01:08:39,770 --> 01:08:41,496
So this is definitely a thing.

898
01:08:43,912 --> 01:08:46,191
He's fucking with us.

899
01:08:46,329 --> 01:08:49,539
Is that your phone?

900
01:08:49,677 --> 01:08:51,334
He's carrying it.

901
01:08:51,472 --> 01:08:52,645
He's right there.

902
01:08:52,783 --> 01:08:54,164
Okay. Wait, wait, wait.
He wants you to chase!

903
01:08:54,302 --> 01:08:56,373
Do you think that guy in there
really just killed himself?

904
01:08:56,511 --> 01:08:57,892
That's not what you people do.

905
01:08:58,030 --> 01:08:59,065
That's not one of the rules, right?

906
01:08:59,204 --> 01:09:01,827
Okay.
None of this is what ghosts do.

907
01:09:01,965 --> 01:09:05,520
Well, the cameras
are still capturing.

908
01:09:05,658 --> 01:09:06,625
We need to find my keys.

909
01:09:06,763 --> 01:09:08,005
Okay. Let's go. Go, go, go.

910
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:09,041
Come on.

911
01:09:09,179 --> 01:09:11,630
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Come on.

912
01:09:21,847 --> 01:09:23,849
Okay, okay, okay.

913
01:09:23,987 --> 01:09:26,645
Okay. I got it.

914
01:09:26,783 --> 01:09:27,404
Hey!

915
01:09:27,542 --> 01:09:29,406
Oh, Vin, damn it!

916
01:09:29,544 --> 01:09:32,202
Vin! Wait!

917
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:33,410
Vin!

918
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:36,482
I'm gonna
kick the shit out of you.

919
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:37,449
Vin, stop!

920
01:09:37,587 --> 01:09:38,139
Stay back!

921
01:09:38,277 --> 01:09:40,417
Vin!

922
01:09:42,592 --> 01:09:43,524
Vin.

923
01:09:43,662 --> 01:09:44,594
What the fuck?

924
01:09:45,042 --> 01:09:48,356
- What?
- Secret door.

925
01:09:49,771 --> 01:09:51,083
I'm not leaving you.

926
01:09:51,221 --> 01:09:53,810
Well, save yourself.

927
01:09:53,948 --> 01:09:56,295
How many do you think there are?

928
01:09:56,433 --> 01:10:00,748
One downstairs and--
and one here.

929
01:10:00,886 --> 01:10:03,751
Here. Trade me weapons.
I'm not much of a gun girl.

930
01:10:03,889 --> 01:10:04,579
Okay.

931
01:10:04,717 --> 01:10:06,098
Hey.

932
01:10:06,236 --> 01:10:09,929
Be careful, okay?

933
01:10:17,730 --> 01:10:22,356
Okay, looks like
it's just me and you, kid.

934
01:10:22,494 --> 01:10:24,496
Sam.

935
01:10:24,634 --> 01:10:25,255
Sam!

936
01:10:25,393 --> 01:10:27,430
God damn it! Sam!

937
01:10:48,761 --> 01:10:50,798
Fuck.

938
01:11:01,395 --> 01:11:04,674
Sam!

939
01:11:04,812 --> 01:11:07,021
Sam!

940
01:11:07,159 --> 01:11:09,644
Sam!

941
01:11:10,921 --> 01:11:13,407
Sam!

942
01:11:15,236 --> 01:11:17,652
Sam!

943
01:11:18,135 --> 01:11:19,482
Sam!

944
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:22,105
Sam!

945
01:11:24,487 --> 01:11:26,799
Sam!

946
01:11:26,937 --> 01:11:29,423
Oh, my God.

947
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:32,840
Oh, my God.

948
01:11:32,978 --> 01:11:35,256
Oh, my God, Sam!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

949
01:11:35,394 --> 01:11:37,051
Don't look, okay?

950
01:11:37,189 --> 01:11:38,811
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I promise.

951
01:11:38,949 --> 01:11:42,021
I promise.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

952
01:11:44,092 --> 01:11:46,681
Oh, shit.

953
01:12:53,610 --> 01:12:55,060
Shit! Wait! Wait!

954
01:12:56,510 --> 01:12:57,890
- Please! Please!
- What are you doing here?

955
01:12:58,028 --> 01:13:00,237
- Stop.
- Answer me!

956
01:13:02,412 --> 01:13:04,069
Amateur.

957
01:13:04,207 --> 01:13:05,381
You killed those people.

958
01:13:05,519 --> 01:13:07,624
You and your whore killed them.

959
01:13:07,762 --> 01:13:08,763
Apostate!

960
01:13:08,901 --> 01:13:11,939
What the fuck
are you talking about?

961
01:13:12,974 --> 01:13:14,735
Shit. He's down here!

962
01:13:40,381 --> 01:13:42,935
I can hear you.

963
01:13:46,318 --> 01:13:48,458
I know you're right there.

964
01:13:49,459 --> 01:13:52,255
Oh, you think this is funny?

965
01:13:53,981 --> 01:13:55,810
What's real funny is the fact

966
01:13:55,948 --> 01:13:59,158
that we destroyed
all your cameras.

967
01:13:59,296 --> 01:14:00,850
Nothing else in this hallway.

968
01:14:00,988 --> 01:14:04,336
No footage for you.

969
01:14:06,511 --> 01:14:09,306
I got one of those, too, asshole.

970
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:14,035
Number one rule,
don't get caught.

971
01:14:19,247 --> 01:14:22,458
Who are you?

972
01:14:23,424 --> 01:14:24,494
Stop.

973
01:15:23,829 --> 01:15:27,143
What the fuck?

974
01:15:33,321 --> 01:15:34,737
What the fuck?

975
01:15:34,875 --> 01:15:38,672
This broadcast is a message

976
01:15:38,810 --> 01:15:41,122
to Vin Cruz

977
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:45,575
of 449 Sequoia Street,

978
01:15:45,713 --> 01:15:49,890
Secaucus, New Jersey.

979
01:15:52,893 --> 01:15:54,895
He's an organ donor.

980
01:15:55,033 --> 01:15:57,414
That's good for him.

981
01:15:57,553 --> 01:16:00,107
May come in handy today.

982
01:16:00,245 --> 01:16:02,212
Go to hell.

983
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:04,283
I'm sorry.

984
01:16:04,421 --> 01:16:07,666
There's no sound on my end.

985
01:16:07,804 --> 01:16:08,978
But from the look
on your face,

986
01:16:09,116 --> 01:16:12,809
I don't think that
was very pleasant.

987
01:16:14,639 --> 01:16:18,332
Oh, no, stop.
Stop. Stop, please.

988
01:16:18,470 --> 01:16:20,506
Don't fuckin' touch her!

989
01:16:20,645 --> 01:16:22,785
Vin! Don't let them get to Sam!

990
01:16:22,923 --> 01:16:25,304
Sam. What?

991
01:16:25,442 --> 01:16:27,617
Hide her!
Don't let them find her.

992
01:16:29,101 --> 01:16:34,072
Mr. Wattley doesn't exist.

993
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:39,802
Mr. Wattley is a collective.

994
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:43,840
And we, Mr. Wattley,

995
01:16:43,978 --> 01:16:48,776
are getting pretty tired
of you.

996
01:16:49,915 --> 01:16:52,815
Especially the ones
who have been visited

997
01:16:52,953 --> 01:16:55,058
by the police.

998
01:16:55,196 --> 01:16:57,509
And even more importantly,

999
01:16:57,647 --> 01:17:01,271
the punks who got caught!

1000
01:17:01,409 --> 01:17:03,549
Like little Miss Laura

1001
01:17:03,688 --> 01:17:07,519
and her pal Adrian!

1002
01:17:07,657 --> 01:17:09,625
Huh?

1003
01:17:11,178 --> 01:17:13,663
Oh, Laura,

1004
01:17:13,801 --> 01:17:17,529
have you been keeping secrets?

1005
01:17:17,667 --> 01:17:20,014
Oh!

1006
01:17:20,774 --> 01:17:23,328
Our little princess

1007
01:17:23,466 --> 01:17:27,539
bludgeoned a girl with a trophy.

1008
01:17:27,677 --> 01:17:30,197
And then she panicked

1009
01:17:30,335 --> 01:17:34,132
and called 911 for help!

1010
01:17:34,270 --> 01:17:35,547
She wasn't breathing.

1011
01:17:35,685 --> 01:17:38,826
- She was gonna die.
- No, no. No.

1012
01:17:38,964 --> 01:17:43,244
She could have been a legend

1013
01:17:43,382 --> 01:17:47,490
if only she followed the rules.

1014
01:17:47,628 --> 01:17:50,631
This is just
some stupid fucking game!

1015
01:17:52,012 --> 01:17:54,393
You're just a tourist.

1016
01:17:54,531 --> 01:17:59,398
Another one of
Laura's reckless acts.

1017
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,234
Ta-da!

1018
01:18:07,372 --> 01:18:09,512
Pretty good, right?

1019
01:18:10,237 --> 01:18:13,896
Did my caretaker act fool you?

1020
01:18:14,034 --> 01:18:16,277
Let's do this.

1021
01:18:19,418 --> 01:18:23,043
This is a message

1022
01:18:23,181 --> 01:18:26,736
from Mr. Wattley.

1023
01:18:27,530 --> 01:18:31,672
Mr. Wattley will no longer

1024
01:18:31,810 --> 01:18:36,021
tolerate amateurs.

1025
01:18:44,478 --> 01:18:47,239
No! No! Vin! No!

1026
01:18:47,377 --> 01:18:48,585
The kid is gone.

1027
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:51,347
Where? Where did she go?

1028
01:18:52,313 --> 01:18:54,937
Home.

1029
01:20:24,164 --> 01:20:26,891
Hey.

1030
01:20:27,029 --> 01:20:29,963
Are you okay?

1031
01:20:31,274 --> 01:20:34,105
Can you talk?

1032
01:20:34,622 --> 01:20:38,178
What's your name?

1033
01:20:38,316 --> 01:20:42,561
Kiki go home. Kiki go home.

1034
01:21:02,927 --> 01:21:04,135
Wattley isn't a person.

1035
01:21:04,273 --> 01:21:05,550
Wattley is not just one person.

1036
01:21:05,688 --> 01:21:06,827
It's all right here.
It's right here.

1037
01:21:06,965 --> 01:21:08,587
It's on this camera.
Just watch the footage.

1038
01:21:08,725 --> 01:21:10,727
They just broke rule number one
on the Ghost Game.

1039
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:12,281
They broke all the rules.

1040
01:21:12,419 --> 01:21:14,973
Wattley is bullshit!
He's bullshit.

1041
01:21:15,111 --> 01:21:17,596
Okay. Somebody please stop this.

1042
01:21:17,734 --> 01:21:18,735
Give me Kiki.
