00:09:20,562 --> 00:09:23,702
After that, I couldn´t eat,
I couldn´t sleep,

180

I couldn´t do anything,

181

"Where is my husband?"

183
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:29,462
"They gonna find him."

184
00:09:29,462 --> 00:09:30,602
That´s what I´m saying
to myself.

185
00:09:30,602 --> 00:09:33,602
They gonna find him.
They gonna find him.

186
00:09:33,602 --> 00:09:36,932
Then I get a call
saying that, um,

187
00:09:36,932 --> 00:09:40,432
they have an American soldier

188
00:09:40,432 --> 00:09:42,102
and they are willing
to do a trade

189
00:09:42,102 --> 00:09:44,532
or something like that.

190
00:09:44,532 --> 00:09:46,662
MEEK: For who?
‐ They didn´t say for who.

191
00:09:46,662 --> 00:09:48,562
They just said they willing
to do a trade.

192
00:09:48,562 --> 00:09:51,462
In my mind, they still
didn´t find my husband.

193
00:09:51,462 --> 00:09:55,102
I don´t know what´s going on.

194
00:09:55,102 --> 00:09:57,462
So any little thing
that somebody tells me,

195
00:09:57,462 --> 00:09:58,902
I´m thinking,
"Could this be my husband?

196
00:09:58,902 --> 00:10:01,932
Could this be my husband?"

197
00:10:01,932 --> 00:10:04,032
‐ If I can go back
and figure out

198
00:10:04,032 --> 00:10:07,502
who gave them that first report,

199
00:10:07,502 --> 00:10:09,332
I´d fucking choke the shit
out of them.

200

I mean, it´s just ‐‐

201
00:10:11,432 --> 00:10:16,432
It´s egregious
that somebody would share

202

203
00:10:18,762 --> 00:10:23,062

assistance officer

208

209
00:10:39,532 --> 00:10:42,262

I think there were

When Colonel Moses came in,

328
00:16:03,232 --> 00:16:06,232

everything was a lie.

Because I had already

330

and spoke to me
about another story.

331
00:16:11,102 --> 00:16:13,202
So I´m thinking when he came,

332
00:16:13,202 --> 00:16:16,162
it was gonna be exact
same story that I heard before,

333
00:16:16,162 --> 00:16:17,862

However, the first
and most consistent thing

364
00:17:39,232 --> 00:17:41,662
I was told
by all the family members

365
00:17:41,662 --> 00:17:44,602
was that they, too,
had received dubious

366

or conflicting information
from the military.

367
00:17:48,102 --> 00:17:49,632
WILL: The immediate report

368
00:17:49,632 --> 00:17:51,532
was that
he had been killed in combat

369
00:17:51,532 --> 00:17:54,732

370
00:17:54,732 --> 00:17:58,032
Mortar fire was the explanation
for his death.

I didn´t have any reason
to think otherwise,

372
00:17:59,702 --> 00:18:02,862

373
00:18:02,862 --> 00:18:06,302
I served for seven years
and saw my share.

374
00:18:06,302 --> 00:18:09,962
And what a mortar does
to the human body ‐‐

375
00:18:09,962 --> 00:18:12,832
shrapnel and fire ‐‐
is a lot different

376
00:18:12,832 --> 00:18:16,562
and is much more graphic
and ‐‐ and sinister

377
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:18,562
than small‐arms fire.

378
00:18:18,562 --> 00:18:21,802
And he was not charred flesh.

379
00:18:21,802 --> 00:18:26,802
He was a man who had stood
his ground and fallen

380
00:18:26,802 --> 00:18:31,102
by small‐arms‐fire bullets
riddling his body.

381
00:18:33,202 --> 00:18:36,602

it really started clicking

MEEK: Five months after
the gunfight in Tongo Tongo,

700
00:35:39,562 --> 00:35:43,002
ISIS in West Africa claimed
responsibility for the attack.

701
00:35:43,002 --> 00:35:45,062
They released
a propaganda video,

702
00:35:45,062 --> 00:35:46,132
which included clips

703
00:35:46,132 --> 00:35:48,262
from Jeremiah Johnson´s
helmet cam,

704
00:35:48,262 --> 00:35:50,632

[ gunfire ]

706
00:35:55,932 --> 00:35:58,762
The video shows the final
desperate minutes of battle

707

from Bryan, Jeremiah, Dustin

Good afternoon, everyone.

720
00:36:39,162 --> 00:36:41,332
We are here this afternoon
to brief you

721
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:45,032
on the findings of U. S. Africa
Command´s investigation

722
00:36:45,032 --> 00:36:48,032
into the ambush of U. S.
and Nigerien soldiers

near the Tongo ‐‐
near Tongo Tongo, Niger,

00:36:53,602 --> 00:36:56,462
and also to answer
your questions.

726
00:36:56,462 --> 00:36:57,732
Before we begin, however,

727
00:36:57,732 --> 00:37:00,202
I would like to extend
my deepest condolences

728
00:37:00,202 --> 00:37:04,702
to the families and loved ones
of those lost in this attack.

729
00:37:04,702 --> 00:37:06,762
Our commitment,
first and foremost,

730
00:37:06,762 --> 00:37:11,132
has been to provide a complete
accounting to the families.

731
00:37:11,132 --> 00:37:13,302
I would like to talk with you
in greater detail

732
00:37:13,302 --> 00:37:16,232
about the preparedness
of Team Quallam to conduct,

733
00:37:16,232 --> 00:37:19,762
partnered, advise, assist
and accompany operations

734
00:37:19,762 --> 00:37:21,832
on 3 and 4 October.

735
00:37:21,832 --> 00:37:25,462
The investigation discovered
the integration and training

736
00:37:25,462 --> 00:37:28,932
with partnered forces
in Niger was inadequate.

737
00:37:28,932 --> 00:37:31,262
Team Quallam did not meet
the appropriate standards

738
00:37:31,262 --> 00:37:33,532
of familiarization
and integration

739
00:37:33,532 --> 00:37:35,432
with the Nigerien
Partner Force

740
00:37:35,432 --> 00:37:39,632
prior to conducting the initial
mission on 3 October.

741
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:43,232
In addition, routine tasks
such as conducting rehearsals

742
00:37:43,232 --> 00:37:45,932
for immediate action drills
upon enemy contact

743
00:37:45,932 --> 00:37:49,432
were not completed prior to
stepping off for this mission.

744
00:37:49,432 --> 00:37:52,702
The team did not conduct
those basic soldier‐level skills

745
00:37:52,702 --> 00:37:54,302
that would ‐‐
that are really necessary

746
00:37:54,302 --> 00:37:57,102
to go on an operation
such as this.

747
00:37:57,102 --> 00:37:59,432
REPORTER #14:
So in layman´s terms,

748
00:37:59,432 --> 00:38:01,362
how would you characterize this?

749
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,402
Are they sloppy
or are they cowboys?

750
00:38:03,402 --> 00:38:04,732
Are they taking too much risk?

751
00:38:04,732 --> 00:38:06,402
What would you tell
the American people about this?

752
00:38:06,402 --> 00:38:08,062
How would you characterize
your behavior?

753
00:38:08,062 --> 00:38:11,202
‐ The special operators on
the continent are serving well.

754
00:38:11,202 --> 00:38:15,402
They do high‐risk missions
and based on my observations,

755
00:38:15,402 --> 00:38:17,462
this particular ‐‐
this particular team

756
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:20,732
is not indicative
of what they do.

757
00:38:20,732 --> 00:38:23,202
KAREN: That was infuriating
to me, and it´s like,

758
00:38:23,202 --> 00:38:24,602
"Oh, my gosh."

759
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,102
I didn´t even finish listening
to the news conference.

760
00:38:26,102 --> 00:38:27,432
I turned it off.

761
00:38:27,432 --> 00:38:30,902
I couldn´t stand to even
look at him after I heard that.

762
00:38:30,902 --> 00:38:33,432
It´s like,
"How can you possibly say that?"

763
00:38:33,432 --> 00:38:37,562
‐ I think it´s an unfair
characterization of an ODA

764
00:38:37,562 --> 00:38:41,662
that found itself
in a bad situation

765
00:38:41,662 --> 00:38:44,132
and did the best
that they could.

766
00:38:44,132 --> 00:38:46,762
And to say
that they weren´t indicative,

767
00:38:46,762 --> 00:38:49,532
I just don´t think
it´s a fair characterization

768
00:38:49,532 --> 00:38:52,662
of ‐‐ of the ‐‐ the men
on that detachment.

769
00:38:52,662 --> 00:38:53,862
‐ It stung.

770
00:38:53,862 --> 00:38:57,502
It hurt...
really bad to hear that

771
00:38:57,502 --> 00:39:00,202
because it was clear

772
00:39:00,202 --> 00:39:05,262
that a statement like that
was protecting the command

773
00:39:05,262 --> 00:39:08,662
and, in a way, trying
to protect the community

774
00:39:08,662 --> 00:39:13,302
while badmouthing a team

775
00:39:13,302 --> 00:39:18,162
that had the odds overwhelmingly
stacked against them.

776
00:39:18,162 --> 00:39:20,502
‐ Those briefings,

777
00:39:20,502 --> 00:39:23,262
I thought, were embarrassing
briefings.

778
00:39:23,262 --> 00:39:27,302
‐ Infuriating, unbelievable

779
00:39:27,302 --> 00:39:29,832
to ‐‐ to literally say these

780
00:39:29,832 --> 00:39:34,802
about my stepson
and his comrades.

781
00:39:37,532 --> 00:39:43,232

about the team
and its competence,

786
00:39:55,032 --> 00:39:56,302
which you said
they were not indicative

787
00:39:56,302 --> 00:39:57,432

788
00:39:57,432 --> 00:39:59,162

789
00:39:59,162 --> 00:40:00,902
That´s what they had ‐‐
‐ Correct.

790
00:40:00,902 --> 00:40:02,262
MEEK:
They said that was hurtful

791
00:40:02,262 --> 00:40:04,232
to the families of the fallen.
They told us that.

792
00:40:04,232 --> 00:40:05,602
‐ Well, it wasn´t intended
to be hurtful

793
00:40:05,602 --> 00:40:07,062
to the families of the fallen.

794
00:40:07,062 --> 00:40:09,262
The intent was to make that
the special operations forces

795
00:40:09,262 --> 00:40:10,962
have difficult missions
on the continent.

796
00:40:10,962 --> 00:40:12,202
They carry them out every day

797
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:14,202

some of the shortcomings

798
00:40:14,202 --> 00:40:15,562

to the overall situation,

801
00:40:19,062 --> 00:40:22,202
but it was never intended
to be hurtful to the families.

802
00:40:22,202 --> 00:40:23,202

Thank you for your time.

803

mean to hurt us, but he did.

And not just as a gold star
mother who´s lost a child,

806
00:40:35,202 --> 00:40:37,632
but as an American.

807
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:41,232
Why would you throw your people
under the bus?

808
00:40:43,102 --> 00:40:46,832
Why would you...

809
00:40:46,832 --> 00:40:49,702

811

813
00:41:01,502 --> 00:41:04,302
Doesn´t the buck stop
with the leader?

814
00:41:06,662 --> 00:41:10,362
Isn´t that why
there´s a chain of command

815
00:41:10,362 --> 00:41:13,562
and isn´t that why the chain
of command is followed?

816
00:41:15,132 --> 00:41:17,132
‐ But according
to General Waldhauser,

817
00:41:17,132 --> 00:41:20,932
ODA 3212 did not follow
the chain of command.

818
00:41:20,932 --> 00:41:23,302
He alleged that the team
did not inform

819
00:41:23,302 --> 00:41:28,202
their commanding officers of the
true intent of their mission.

820
00:41:28,202 --> 00:41:30,432
‐ The investigation
also found the team

821
00:41:30,432 --> 00:41:33,132
inaccurately portrayed
the concept of operations

822
00:41:33,132 --> 00:41:36,132
for the first
of three total missions

823
00:41:36,132 --> 00:41:38,562
on 3 and 4 October.

824
00:41:38,562 --> 00:41:41,332
Mark: If I were to summarize
the report in one sentence,

825
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:44,832
it said that the ODA
was ill‐prepared

826
00:41:44,832 --> 00:41:47,832
and conducting
an unauthorized mission.

827
00:41:47,832 --> 00:41:50,032
‐ Not only did
General Waldhauser suggest

828
00:41:50,032 --> 00:41:54,062
that ODA 3212
was relatively incompetent,

829
00:41:54,062 --> 00:41:56,602
he went on to claim
that this team of Green Berets

830
00:41:56,602 --> 00:42:01,162
left base under false pretenses
to try to capture or kill

831
00:42:01,162 --> 00:42:03,832
one of the most dangerous
terrorists in the region ‐‐

832
00:42:03,832 --> 00:42:06,762
A man named Doundou Chefou.

833
00:42:06,762 --> 00:42:09,932
In effect, he accused the team
of going on a rogue mission

834
00:42:09,932 --> 00:42:12,302
for the ISIS commander´s scalp.

835
00:42:12,302 --> 00:42:13,462
The Pentagon investigation

836
00:42:13,462 --> 00:42:15,702
found the team´s commanders,
two captains,

837
00:42:15,702 --> 00:42:17,802
mischaracterized
the initial mission,

838
00:42:17,802 --> 00:42:20,402
claiming it was less dangerous
than it really was.

839
00:42:20,402 --> 00:42:23,132
ROGER: Had the first mission
been properly characterized,

840
00:42:23,132 --> 00:42:25,762
it would have been required
to ‐‐ to be approved

841
00:42:25,762 --> 00:42:26,902
at a higher level.

842
00:42:26,902 --> 00:42:28,232
And by being approved
at a higher level,

843
00:42:28,232 --> 00:42:29,962
it would have received
more oversight

844
00:42:29,962 --> 00:42:31,302
from the chain of command.

845
00:42:31,302 --> 00:42:33,862
‐We started to see press reports
come out

846
00:42:33,862 --> 00:42:37,102
that there was, you know, claims

847
00:42:37,102 --> 00:42:42,732
that ODA 3212
decided on their own

848
00:42:42,732 --> 00:42:48,462
that they would, um, institute
a kill/capture mission

849
00:42:48,462 --> 00:42:53,332
to one of the lieutenants
of, uh, ISIS in Niger.

850
00:42:53,332 --> 00:42:55,302
‐ That kind of narrative,
as it started to leak out,

851
00:42:55,302 --> 00:42:58,402
kind of gave me pause
because something like this,

852
00:42:58,402 --> 00:42:59,832
from what I understood,

853
00:42:59,832 --> 00:43:02,662
was going after a, you know,
a highly targeted,

854
00:43:02,662 --> 00:43:06,032
well‐known terrorist commander

855
00:43:06,032 --> 00:43:07,532
and would have had
a lot of visibility.

856
00:43:07,532 --> 00:43:10,432
So to think that the team
could just kind of go rogue

857
00:43:10,432 --> 00:43:12,662
on its own
just didn´t make sense to me.

858
00:43:12,662 --> 00:43:18,232
‐ I don´t buy the fact that
the ODA submitted their plan,

859
00:43:18,232 --> 00:43:21,132
and then at the last minute,

860
00:43:21,132 --> 00:43:23,532
rolled over in their trucks
to ‐‐ to the Nigeriens

861
00:43:23,532 --> 00:43:25,402
and said, "Let´s go.

862
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:28,162
We´re ‐‐ We´ll tell you
when we get there."

863
00:43:28,162 --> 00:43:30,602
It doesn´t work like that.
That´s not how we operate.

864
00:43:30,602 --> 00:43:35,162
‐ Going after
a high‐value target,

865
00:43:35,162 --> 00:43:38,362
like this gentleman,
is a top‐down process,

866
00:43:38,362 --> 00:43:40,032
and it is top‐down approved.

867
00:43:40,032 --> 00:43:42,702
It´s a 4‐star‐level
approval con‐op.

868
00:43:42,702 --> 00:43:45,262
You don´t ‐‐ You can´t get away
with cutting and pasting

869
00:43:45,262 --> 00:43:46,802
and, you know,
getting in your trucks

870
00:43:46,802 --> 00:43:49,462
and going, "Yeehaw," right?
You just can´t do it.

871
00:43:49,462 --> 00:43:51,232
‐ They don´t need to act
like my son

872
00:43:51,232 --> 00:43:54,062
was some kind of damn Rambo

873
00:43:54,062 --> 00:43:57,902
out there on his own
doing something.

874
00:43:57,902 --> 00:44:00,902
Because all he was doing
was what he was told,

875
00:44:00,902 --> 00:44:04,262
and...he fought his ass off.

876
00:44:12,402 --> 00:44:15,832
ALAN: On September 28,
I left Niger

877
00:44:15,832 --> 00:44:18,032
and went back to Fort Bragg,
North Carolina,

878
00:44:18,032 --> 00:44:20,362
where my pregnant wife
and daughter

879
00:44:20,362 --> 00:44:22,202
were waiting for me.

880
00:44:22,202 --> 00:44:25,732
We went to the hospital
on October 1st

881
00:44:25,732 --> 00:44:27,232
for my wife to be induced,

882
00:44:27,232 --> 00:44:30,332
and my second daughter
was born

883
00:44:30,332 --> 00:44:33,202

00:44:38,932 --> 00:44:40,502
we´re getting ready
to be discharged.

887
00:44:40,502 --> 00:44:43,562
I brought the car seat up,
get the baby loaded up,

888
00:44:43,562 --> 00:44:46,762
and my phone, uh, received
a text message

889
00:44:46,762 --> 00:44:50,662
and all it said was,
"You need to come in to work.

890
00:44:50,662 --> 00:44:53,962
Something has happened."

891
00:44:53,962 --> 00:44:56,602
‐ Exactly what did happen
is in dispute.

892
00:44:56,602 --> 00:44:59,932
The United States Africa Command
released their version

893
00:44:59,932 --> 00:45:04,962
of the events in this 268‐page,
heavily redacted report.

894
00:45:04,962 --> 00:45:06,502
It´s a combination of facts

895
00:45:06,502 --> 00:45:09,232
and what many people
close to the investigation say

896
00:45:09,232 --> 00:45:13,362

traveled in three vehicles,

908
00:45:42,532 --> 00:45:46,532
two of which were equipped

The concept of operations

that the purpose of the mission
was to conduct a civil

and military reconnaissance
in the vicinity of Tiloa.

919

MARK: The plan, submitted
to higher headquarters,

920
00:46:16,232 --> 00:46:20,602
called for them to do a patrol
that would include a series

921
00:46:20,602 --> 00:46:22,902
of what we call
key leader engagements

922
00:46:22,902 --> 00:46:25,032
to meet with local leaders,

00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:27,162
discuss the situation
on the ground,

924
00:46:27,162 --> 00:46:29,232
and, if possible,
find any intelligence leads

925

may be able to give them.

♫♫

927
00:46:34,402 --> 00:46:36,932
NARRATOR: The mission plan did
not accurately characterize

928
00:46:36,932 --> 00:46:39,202
the intended purpose
of the mission.

929
00:46:39,202 --> 00:46:44,262
‐ From the beginning, everything
was negative about the team.

930
00:46:44,262 --> 00:46:48,362
Basically, what they said
was the team leader lied

931
00:46:48,362 --> 00:46:54,332
in the brief that he submitted
to hire for the mission.

932
00:46:54,332 --> 00:46:56,502
NARRATOR:
The mission was, in fact,

933
00:46:56,502 --> 00:46:59,362
to pinpoint the location of
and capture

934
00:46:59,362 --> 00:47:03,062
or, if necessary,
kill the ISIS‐GS sub‐commander.

MARK: I have a really hard time
believing that to be the case.

936
00:47:06,332 --> 00:47:08,902
Doundou Chefou was identified

937
00:47:08,902 --> 00:47:13,462
as a leader of the Islamic State
in the Greater Sahara,

938
00:47:13,462 --> 00:47:15,832
and to say
that the ODA went rogue

939
00:47:15,832 --> 00:47:17,732
and not only
the detachment commander,

940
00:47:17,732 --> 00:47:19,202
but that the team sergeant

941
00:47:19,202 --> 00:47:21,662
and all these
other experienced NCOs

942
00:47:21,662 --> 00:47:24,802
all agreed to go on a mission

943
00:47:24,802 --> 00:47:26,432
to kill or capture
Doundou Chefou

944
00:47:26,432 --> 00:47:30,202
and just blatantly lie,
it would be a big deal.

945
00:47:30,202 --> 00:47:32,402
‐ A captain on an "A" team

946
00:47:32,402 --> 00:47:35,662
does not have the authority
or the power

947
00:47:35,662 --> 00:47:38,102
to make those decisions.

948
00:47:38,102 --> 00:47:39,902
‐ I didn´t have any inside
information telling me all this,

949
00:47:39,902 --> 00:47:41,862
but I just know,
as an infantry man,

950
00:47:41,862 --> 00:47:43,102
we would never do that.

951
00:47:43,102 --> 00:47:46,062
We would never go
on a rogue mission

952
00:47:46,062 --> 00:47:48,132
outside the wire
to track down somebody.

953
00:47:48,132 --> 00:47:51,362
And so, it just did not
smell truthful.

954
00:47:52,762 --> 00:47:55,232
NARRATOR: Once in Tiloa,
the team searched for

successfully locate

They conducted the rest
of their mission

They made it to Tiloa.

963
00:48:14,502 --> 00:48:18,232
They checked on the Nigerien
checkpoint that was out there

964

and, um,
they got to change the mission.

973
00:48:47,262 --> 00:48:50,102
NARRATOR: During the team´s
return to base from Tiloa,

974
00:48:50,102 --> 00:48:52,402
they received
high‐confidence intelligence

975
00:48:52,402 --> 00:48:54,762
that placed the ISIS‐GS
sub‐commander

976
00:48:54,762 --> 00:48:57,732
northwest of Tiloa,
near the Mali border.

977
00:48:58,962 --> 00:49:04,032
MARK: This is when they were
redirected to go to a location

978
00:49:04,032 --> 00:49:06,762
where the higher headquarters
believe that Doundou Chefou,

979
00:49:06,762 --> 00:49:09,802
or at least a cellphone
associated with him,

980
00:49:09,802 --> 00:49:11,832
had been present for the night.

NARRATOR:
This time‐sensitive intelligence

982
00:49:13,732 --> 00:49:16,362
gave the Nigerien
and U. S. forces

983
00:49:16,362 --> 00:49:19,762
a narrow window to capture him
while he remained in Niger.

985
00:49:20,902 --> 00:49:23,002
you have Colonel Brad Moses
getting involved

getting involved.

MARK:
Lieutenant Colonel Painter

988
00:49:26,762 --> 00:49:29,362
was the Special Forces
battalion commander,

989
00:49:29,362 --> 00:49:35,062

on the ‐‐ on the continent.

991
00:49:36,232 --> 00:49:38,832
NARRATOR: The approved
concept of operation

992
00:49:38,832 --> 00:49:41,962
called for another U. S.
and Nigerien partnered force

993
00:49:41,962 --> 00:49:44,662
to clear the target,
with the Quallam‐based team

994
00:49:44,662 --> 00:49:47,002
serving
as a quick reaction force.

995
00:49:47,002 --> 00:49:48,062
MEEK: The new mission called

996
00:49:48,062 --> 00:49:50,362
for a second,
more seasoned ODA team

997
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:52,102
to fly in on helicopters

998
00:49:52,102 --> 00:49:54,632
and raid the campsite
of Doundou Chefou.

999
00:49:54,632 --> 00:49:57,032
That´s the same ISIS commander
who the team

1000
00:49:57,032 --> 00:50:00,002
was accused
of going rogue to hunt down.

1001
00:50:00,002 --> 00:50:02,362
So at this point, ODA 3212,

1002
00:50:02,362 --> 00:50:05,002
also referred to
as the Quallam‐based team,

1003
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,402
is ordered
to play a backup role.

1004
00:50:07,402 --> 00:50:11,362
Their job will be to reinforce
their comrades if they need it.

00:50:12,802 --> 00:50:15,302
NARRATOR: However,
due to weather constraints,

1007
00:50:15,302 --> 00:50:18,032
the other team was forced
to return to base.

RAY: The initial ODA coming
from another part of Niger

1009
00:50:24,162 --> 00:50:26,362
couldn´t make it
due to weather conditions,

1010
00:50:26,362 --> 00:50:29,802
and now the responsibility
goes to Jeremiah´s team.

Instead of ending the mission

and 3212 going back to camp,

1013
00:50:35,432 --> 00:50:39,202
they told them to continue
without the other forces

1014
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:41,332

to be the main reigning force.

1020
00:50:54,962 --> 00:50:56,762
After all,
according to the AFRICOM report,

1021
00:50:56,762 --> 00:51:00,262
they had just set out on a rogue
mission to do exactly that.

1022
00:51:02,332 --> 00:51:04,162
Have you ever seen that image?

Captain Perozeni was assigned

as the Special Forces
detachment commander,

1028
00:51:19,032 --> 00:51:23,162
so he is the senior officer
on that detachment

1029
00:51:23,162 --> 00:51:26,832
and is responsible for the
conduct of all their operations.

1030
00:51:26,832 --> 00:51:28,362
MEEK: According to those
who were there,

1031
00:51:28,362 --> 00:51:30,802
this is one of the moments
when the detachment commander,

1032
00:51:30,802 --> 00:51:32,432
Captain Mike Perozeni,

1033
00:51:32,432 --> 00:51:35,002
was pushing back
against the new orders.

1034
00:51:35,002 --> 00:51:37,602
He spoke to his command
in satellite phone calls

1035
00:51:37,602 --> 00:51:39,232
and text messages,

1036
00:51:39,232 --> 00:51:42,762
telling them that to head north
deep into unfamiliar desert

00:51:44,232 --> 00:51:47,132
no possibility of speedy
medical evacuation,

an exhausted Nigerien
partner force,

1040
00:51:49,602 --> 00:51:54,002
and his own lightly armed team
was needlessly risky.

TERRI: He protested vigorously
is my understanding.

1042
00:51:58,202 --> 00:52:01,662
He knew that
they weren´t...equipped.

1043
00:52:01,662 --> 00:52:04,732
He knew that
that wasn´t their mission.

1044
00:52:06,762 --> 00:52:09,402
That´s not what
they were there for.

1045
00:52:09,402 --> 00:52:12,732
‐ He objected because he knew
that his unit

1046
00:52:12,732 --> 00:52:17,632
was not prepared to do this ‐‐
this new mission

1047
00:52:17,632 --> 00:52:19,302
because they left
for a day trip,

1048
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:24,902
not an overnight movement,
and not to go fight somebody.

1049
00:52:24,902 --> 00:52:27,702
‐ In Mike Perozeni´s mind
on the ground,

1050
00:52:27,702 --> 00:52:29,962
he´s identifying risk.

1051
00:52:29,962 --> 00:52:33,732
He was communicating back
to the company headquarters

1052
00:52:33,732 --> 00:52:36,562
and ultimately back up
to Lieutenant Colonel Painter

1053
00:52:36,562 --> 00:52:40,062
the risks that were involved
from his standpoint

1054
00:52:40,062 --> 00:52:41,232
on the ground.

1055
00:52:41,232 --> 00:52:45,262
‐ Now, deep in the highly
censored AFRICOM report,

1056
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:47,262
they do acknowledge
that Captain Perozeni

1057
00:52:47,262 --> 00:52:49,332
tried to have
the mission scrubbed.

1058
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:50,962
WILL:
"In order to conduct this raid,

25 kilometers north

1061
00:52:55,702 --> 00:52:59,362
through difficult terrain
under limited visibility.

1062
00:52:59,362 --> 00:53:00,932
Given that distance

redacted expressed to redacted

redacted´s preference

MARK: "...but redacted

1070
00:53:22,762 --> 00:53:24,432
ALAN: I highly doubt

1071
00:53:24,432 --> 00:53:29,102
that Mike politely, uh,
expressed a "preference"

1072
00:53:29,102 --> 00:53:33,802
as it said in the investigation
of ‐‐ of his concerns.

1073
00:53:33,802 --> 00:53:35,932
Mike will speak his mind.

1074
00:53:35,932 --> 00:53:39,002
Mike, uh, will not
hold anything back,

1075
00:53:39,002 --> 00:53:42,662
and so I have no doubt that
he expressed those concerns.

1076
00:53:42,662 --> 00:53:45,662
‐ The U. S. Special Forces
commander for Northwest Africa

1077
00:53:45,662 --> 00:53:47,162
was Lieutenant Colonel
David Painter,

1078
00:53:47,162 --> 00:53:49,702
who was hundreds of miles
away in Chad,

1079
00:53:49,702 --> 00:53:52,702
and he overruled
Captain Perozeni´s objections.

1080
00:53:52,702 --> 00:53:54,132
Colonel Brad Moses,

1081
00:53:54,132 --> 00:53:57,602
the 3rd Special Forces group
commander based in Germany,

1082
00:53:57,602 --> 00:54:00,332
also was informed
of the changes to mission

1083
00:54:00,332 --> 00:54:03,432
and that Perozeni and ODA 3212

1084
00:54:03,432 --> 00:54:07,232
were now going to be the main
force raiding the campsite.

1085
00:54:07,232 --> 00:54:09,662
But Colonel Moses told me that
Lieutenant Colonel Painter

1086
00:54:09,662 --> 00:54:12,562
did not tell him about
Captain Perozeni´s objections

1087
00:54:12,562 --> 00:54:13,902
to going forward.

1088
00:54:13,902 --> 00:54:16,402
He says had he known about
the captain´s concerns

1089
00:54:16,402 --> 00:54:19,802
about the mission, he would have
called him directly.

1090
00:54:19,802 --> 00:54:22,732
DEBBIE:
They were told to go anyway.

1091
00:54:22,732 --> 00:54:26,132
They didn´t care that there was
no backup for those boys.

1092
00:54:28,032 --> 00:54:33,862
‐ The way I operated as a ‐‐
as commander of SOC Africa was,

1093
00:54:33,862 --> 00:54:37,332
my guys on the ground tell me
what they´re going to do

1094
00:54:37,332 --> 00:54:39,662
and what they´re not
going to do, right,

1095
00:54:39,662 --> 00:54:41,332
based off of the risk.

1096
00:54:41,332 --> 00:54:43,162
And the captain tells me ‐‐

1097
00:54:43,162 --> 00:54:45,032
a team leader
on the ground tells me ‐‐

1098
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:47,802
"Hey, sir." Or it comes up
through the chain.

1099
00:54:47,802 --> 00:54:49,862
"No way.
This is just ‐‐

1100
00:54:49,862 --> 00:54:51,802
I just don´t feel comfortable
with it."

1101
00:54:51,802 --> 00:54:53,602
Then the brake goes on hard.

1102
00:54:53,602 --> 00:54:56,532
MEEK: I guess one big question
that comes to mind with all this

1103
00:54:56,532 --> 00:54:59,362
is if your captain had come up
with this plan

1104
00:54:59,362 --> 00:55:01,062
and "We´re gonna ‐‐
We´re gonna make our bones.

1105
00:55:01,062 --> 00:55:02,332
We´re gonna make our careers.

1106
00:55:02,332 --> 00:55:04,202
We´re gonna go kill this guy
or capture him

1107
00:55:04,202 --> 00:55:05,302
and we´ll be the heroes,"

1108
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:06,902
or whatever their motives
would have been,

1109
00:55:06,902 --> 00:55:08,902
if Africa command was correct,

1110
00:55:08,902 --> 00:55:11,802
that that´s what they were doing
from the start,

1111
00:55:11,802 --> 00:55:13,562
if all that was true,

1112
00:55:13,562 --> 00:55:15,862
why would this guy,
Captain Mike Perozeni,

1113
00:55:15,862 --> 00:55:19,362
object to searching
his target´s campsite?

1114
00:55:19,362 --> 00:55:20,432
ALAN: It makes no sense.

1115
00:55:21,862 --> 00:55:24,132
Why would he push back now

1116
00:55:24,132 --> 00:55:27,202
if he was supposedly on board
at the very front?

1117
00:55:27,202 --> 00:55:30,202
Why would he be issuing
or expressing concerns

1118
00:55:30,202 --> 00:55:34,402
about not being equipped
or prepared

1119
00:55:34,402 --> 00:55:36,802
if that was his intent
all along?

1120
00:55:36,802 --> 00:55:38,432
MEEK:
Not only did Captain Perozeni

1121
00:55:38,432 --> 00:55:40,362
object to the missions
assigned in the field,

1122
00:55:40,362 --> 00:55:42,862
he first voiced concerns
before his team

1123
00:55:42,862 --> 00:55:44,602
even left their base in Quallam.

1124
00:55:44,602 --> 00:55:46,762
ALAN: The people
in my company headquarters

1125
00:55:46,762 --> 00:55:49,662
knew that Mike pushed back.

1126
00:55:49,662 --> 00:55:51,702
So why that wasn´t shared
with the families,

1127
00:55:51,702 --> 00:55:55,002
I´ll never know,
but I will say there´s no reason

1128
00:55:55,002 --> 00:55:57,162
it should not have been
shared with the families.

1129
00:55:57,162 --> 00:56:01,232
‐ I was left with the impression
that this guy was a screw‐up.

1130
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:05,562
And he screwed up and carried
my son off and got him killed

1131
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:10,532
because that´s what
I was led to believe.

1132
00:56:10,532 --> 00:56:13,632
And I think that´s probably
the biggest injustice

1133
00:56:13,632 --> 00:56:17,502
was I walked around
pissed off for a year

1134
00:56:17,502 --> 00:56:21,262
and my anger was directed
toward somebody

1135
00:56:21,262 --> 00:56:25,102
that was completely innocent
of what they told me he did.

1136
00:56:25,102 --> 00:56:27,762
HENRY: It´s clear that
if he had been listened to,

1137
00:56:27,762 --> 00:56:32,662
my son and Jeremiah,

1138
00:56:32,662 --> 00:56:36,232
La David, and Dustin
would be here today.

1139
00:56:37,732 --> 00:56:41,832
MARK: The only reason why they
would accuse Captain Perozeni

1140
00:56:41,832 --> 00:56:45,802
and the team of lying
and mischaracterizing

1141
00:56:45,802 --> 00:56:51,362
is to somehow absolve
the chain of command above them

1142
00:56:51,362 --> 00:56:55,262
and basically say because they
went out under false pretenses,

1143
00:56:55,262 --> 00:56:57,832
they put themselves
in a bad situation

1144
00:56:57,832 --> 00:57:00,262
and are therefore responsible
for what happened.

1145
00:57:02,362 --> 00:57:04,032
‐ There´s no way ‐‐

1146
00:57:04,032 --> 00:57:09,232
Like I say,
anybody with any common sense

1147
00:57:09,232 --> 00:57:12,162
would be headed back to base

1148
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:13,902
and then all of a sudden decide
to turn around

1149
00:57:13,902 --> 00:57:16,832
and go six hours the other way
in the middle of the night.

1150
00:57:18,932 --> 00:57:20,662
NARRATOR: Through the night
of October 3rd,

1151
00:57:20,662 --> 00:57:24,532
the team made the difficult
movement north to the target.

1152
00:57:24,532 --> 00:57:26,402
MARK: They traveled
from late afternoon

1153
00:57:26,402 --> 00:57:29,602
till early the next morning
to get to the position.

1154
00:57:29,602 --> 00:57:31,732
NARRATOR:
On the morning of October 4th,

1155
00:57:31,732 --> 00:57:34,362
the team reached the objective
at sunrise,

1156
00:57:34,362 --> 00:57:37,932
but the enemy had already
departed the area.

1157
00:57:37,932 --> 00:57:40,132
The team discovered
enemy rations,

1158
00:57:40,132 --> 00:57:44,562
a motorcycle, drying uniforms,
and warm fire pits.

1159
00:57:44,562 --> 00:57:47,032
RAY:
This campsite was abandoned.

1160
00:57:47,032 --> 00:57:49,402
Nothing there to speak of.

1161
00:57:49,402 --> 00:57:50,802
And that they were
just gonna go off

1162
00:57:50,802 --> 00:57:55,462
looking for trash
and pocket litter.

1163
00:57:55,462 --> 00:57:57,632
ALAN:
In the middle of the desert,

1164
00:57:57,632 --> 00:57:59,762
there is nothing urgent enough

1165
00:57:59,762 --> 00:58:02,802
to send an improperly
supplied element

1166
00:58:02,802 --> 00:58:04,862
that far out into the desert.

1167
00:58:04,862 --> 00:58:07,502
NARRATOR: After completing the
mission near the Mali border,

1168
00:58:07,502 --> 00:58:11,562
the team was directed by
AOB Niger to return to base.

RAY:
While returning to base,

1172
00:58:23,332 --> 00:58:26,962
Team Quallam´s partner,
Nigerien forces, needed water,

1173
00:58:26,962 --> 00:58:28,232
so the convoy stopped

1174
00:58:28,232 --> 00:58:31,662
near the village
of Tongo Tongo to resupply.

1175
00:58:33,702 --> 00:58:35,302
NARRATOR: As the team waited,

1176
00:58:35,302 --> 00:58:38,362
they conducted an impromptu
key leader engagement

1177
00:58:38,362 --> 00:58:40,602
with the village elder.

1178
00:58:40,602 --> 00:58:42,332
During
the key leader engagement,

1179
00:58:42,332 --> 00:58:47,732
team members met with leaders
and 27 men of the village.

1180
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:50,262
The meeting lasted
about 30 minutes longer

1181
00:58:50,262 --> 00:58:52,732
than the team commander
expected.

1182
00:58:52,732 --> 00:58:54,302
WILL: "Witnesses believe
the village owner

Shortly thereafter,

a villager approaching
the village from the tree line

1192

to the east directed
the convoy down a road,

1193

which appeared to cut
through the wood line

1194

most of the three dozen Nigerien
troops with the ODA fled,

01:08:10,462 --> 01:08:13,962
simply as a 3‐man
Nigerien reconnaissance team

1382
01:08:13,962 --> 01:08:16,862
and a truck they labeled
Nigerien vehicle number 3

1383
01:08:16,862 --> 01:08:19,802
was, in fact, a team

1384
01:08:19,802 --> 01:08:22,162
of Nigerien CIA operatives.

1385
01:08:23,732 --> 01:08:26,402
It´s not at all uncommon
for CIA operatives

1386
01:08:26,402 --> 01:08:28,462
who are going
into dangerous areas

1387
01:08:28,462 --> 01:08:31,562
to be in the company of
U. S. Special Forces soldiers.

1388
01:08:31,562 --> 01:08:34,132
But because of the top‐secret
nature of their work,

1389
01:08:34,132 --> 01:08:36,662
it´s not always clear to the
troops they´re operating with

1390
01:08:36,662 --> 01:08:39,632
what or who they´re looking for.

1391
01:08:39,632 --> 01:08:42,332
In this case, the American
trained and outfitted operatives

1392
01:08:42,332 --> 01:08:44,502
were carrying
a sophisticated device

1393
01:08:44,502 --> 01:08:48,432
which can covertly lock onto
and track a cellphone signal.

1394
01:08:48,432 --> 01:08:50,002
And with it, we have learned,

1395
01:08:50,002 --> 01:08:52,902
they were the ones
who were hunting Doundou Chefou

1396
01:08:52,902 --> 01:08:56,502
in the hope that he would lead
them to an even bigger prize ‐‐

1397
01:08:56,502 --> 01:08:59,762
an American Christian aid worker
named Jeffery Woodke,

1398
01:08:59,762 --> 01:09:02,762
who was being held hostage
somewhere in the region.

1399
01:09:07,362 --> 01:09:11,632
ELS: When Jeff was a child,
he used to spin the globe

1400
01:09:11,632 --> 01:09:13,632
and look where he stopped.

1401
01:09:13,632 --> 01:09:15,562
And one time he stopped

1402
01:09:15,562 --> 01:09:17,902
and his finger was pointed
at Niger.

1403
01:09:17,902 --> 01:09:19,432
And he told his mom,

1404
01:09:19,432 --> 01:09:23,362
"When I grew up,
I´m gonna go to Niger."

1405
01:09:23,362 --> 01:09:26,702
When he was grown up,
he remembered that moment

1406
01:09:26,702 --> 01:09:30,262
and he looked up and saw
how poor the nation was

1407
01:09:30,262 --> 01:09:33,862
and when he sees suffering,
he wants to alleviate it.

1408
01:09:33,862 --> 01:09:37,162
He looks for ways to help
the people.

1409
01:09:37,162 --> 01:09:40,662
So he build wells.
He did animal vaccinations.

1410
01:09:40,662 --> 01:09:45,062
He helped create schools for
kids so they could be educated.

1411
01:09:46,302 --> 01:09:49,132
He worked very close
with the local population

1412
01:09:49,132 --> 01:09:50,962
in view of their needs.

1413
01:09:53,502 --> 01:09:57,362
‐ This was the start
of the whole process

1414
01:09:57,362 --> 01:09:59,462
of the upwards budget.

1415
01:09:59,462 --> 01:10:00,532
ELS: That morning,

1416
01:10:00,532 --> 01:10:03,632
Jeff announced
this special project.

1417
01:10:05,532 --> 01:10:07,162
We´re seeing the video of Jeff

1418
01:10:07,162 --> 01:10:09,662
with the leaders
of the community.

1419
01:10:09,662 --> 01:10:13,302
After all that, he went home.

1420
01:10:13,302 --> 01:10:14,602
And then it happened.

1421
01:10:16,932 --> 01:10:19,002
He heard ‐‐ he heard shots.

1422
01:10:19,002 --> 01:10:20,002
He ran away.

1423
01:10:22,732 --> 01:10:24,332
He fleed.

1424
01:10:24,332 --> 01:10:29,532
♫♫

1425
01:10:29,532 --> 01:10:31,202
But they ‐‐ they got him.

1426
01:10:31,202 --> 01:10:36,632
♫♫

1427
01:10:45,262 --> 01:10:48,102
Then it was just all a blur.

1428
01:10:51,162 --> 01:10:53,462
I just kept saying no.

1429
01:10:53,462 --> 01:10:56,762
It took a long time for me
to, um,

1430
01:10:56,762 --> 01:11:00,102
to really accept the reality
that it had really happened.

1431
01:11:00,102 --> 01:11:02,202
Yeah.

1432
01:11:02,202 --> 01:11:04,932
[ sighs ] Yeah.

1433
01:11:07,162 --> 01:11:11,002
‐ Certainly, we knew
who Jeff Woodke was in Niger.

1434
01:11:11,002 --> 01:11:13,002
His clothes were
in my headquarters,

1435
01:11:13,002 --> 01:11:16,162
so that should he be freed
during our time there,

1436
01:11:16,162 --> 01:11:18,962
he would be brought through
and given back his belongings

1437
01:11:18,962 --> 01:11:23,262
as part of his reintegration
to feel human again.

1438
01:11:23,262 --> 01:11:27,962
But when ODA 3212 left the wire
on their reconnaissance mission,

1439
01:11:27,962 --> 01:11:30,302
never was there an understanding

1440
01:11:30,302 --> 01:11:31,762
that it related
to Jeffery Woodke.

1441
01:11:31,762 --> 01:11:33,932
It wasn´t in any
of the mission plans.

1442
01:11:33,932 --> 01:11:36,202
It was never told to me
after the fact.

1443
01:11:36,202 --> 01:11:39,802
It was never in any of the
conversations that took place.

1444
01:11:39,802 --> 01:11:41,362
‐ Jeffery Woodke
was never brought up

1445
01:11:41,362 --> 01:11:43,032
in any of the mission planning

1446
01:11:43,032 --> 01:11:45,332
and his name appears nowhere

1447
01:11:45,332 --> 01:11:49,332
in the 268‐page
redacted AFRICOM report.

1448
01:11:49,332 --> 01:11:50,902
Plus, the four families
of the fallen

1449
01:11:50,902 --> 01:11:54,302
were never told about
any connection between Woodke

1450
01:11:54,302 --> 01:11:58,432
and the missions until General
Waldhauser alleged that

1451
01:11:58,432 --> 01:11:59,802
in his press conference,

1452
01:11:59,802 --> 01:12:01,902
shocking nearly everyone
who heard it.

1453
01:12:01,902 --> 01:12:04,902
‐ And I think it´s important
to underscore why then

1454
01:12:04,902 --> 01:12:06,262
was that mission undertaken?

1455
01:12:06,262 --> 01:12:08,202
Why was it so important
to send those people up there?

1456
01:12:08,202 --> 01:12:10,502
We´ve had an American citizen
by the name of Jeffery Woodke,

1457
01:12:10,502 --> 01:12:13,232
who´s been captured
and held hostage

1458
01:12:13,232 --> 01:12:16,202
in somewhere in that area
for the last year and a half,

1459
01:12:16,202 --> 01:12:19,202
and there was a possibility
that what they might find

1460
01:12:19,202 --> 01:12:21,362
at that target
would be a piece of the puzzle

1461
01:12:21,362 --> 01:12:22,702
of the whole
of government approach

1462
01:12:22,702 --> 01:12:24,862
to try to return an American
who´s been held hostage

1463
01:12:24,862 --> 01:12:26,432
for over a year and a half.

1464
01:12:26,432 --> 01:12:29,532
MEEK: You´ll recall at General
Waldhauser´s press briefing,

1465
01:12:29,532 --> 01:12:31,462
he wasn´t asked
a question about this,

1466
01:12:31,462 --> 01:12:35,032
but he just sort of
brought up Jeffery Woodke.

1467
01:12:35,032 --> 01:12:38,832
And he said that third mission
in searching that site

1468
01:12:38,832 --> 01:12:43,702
was to look for intelligence on
that hostage Jeffery Woodke.

1469
01:12:43,702 --> 01:12:46,702
Is that something
that you´ve ever heard?

1470
01:12:46,702 --> 01:12:48,432
‐ I had never heard that,

1471
01:12:48,432 --> 01:12:52,602
and I don´t recall that ever
being part of the instructions

1472
01:12:52,602 --> 01:12:57,602
that were given to
Captain Perozeni and his team.

1473
01:12:57,602 --> 01:13:01,562
So I´m not sure where
that characterization came from.

1474
01:13:01,562 --> 01:13:03,362
MEEK: Jeffery Woodke,

1475
01:13:03,362 --> 01:13:05,602
this hostage that´s been held
since October 2016.

1476
01:13:07,402 --> 01:13:08,732
‐ Yeah.

1477
01:13:08,732 --> 01:13:10,332
MEEK: His name come up
in the briefings?

1478
01:13:10,332 --> 01:13:13,132
‐ No, never once.

1479
01:13:13,132 --> 01:13:15,132
‐ The mission was
a sensitive site ‐‐

1480
01:13:15,132 --> 01:13:17,202
clear a sensitive site
for intelligence.

1481
01:13:17,202 --> 01:13:19,202
ALAN: For General Waldhauser
to say,

1482
01:13:19,202 --> 01:13:21,202
"We were out there
looking for Jeff Woodke,"

1483
01:13:21,202 --> 01:13:24,062
seemed like a convenient excuse
on his part

1484
01:13:24,062 --> 01:13:26,102
as the commander of AFRICOM

1485
01:13:26,102 --> 01:13:31,432
to try and put a, uh, noble
cause about what we were doing.

1486
01:13:31,432 --> 01:13:33,402
MEEK: Does that change things,

1487
01:13:33,402 --> 01:13:37,432
how you see what Jeremiah
was doing out there at all?

1488
01:13:37,432 --> 01:13:39,262
If he was part of a team
that was helping

1489
01:13:39,262 --> 01:13:43,102
to facilitate efforts to locate
and eventually recover

1490
01:13:43,102 --> 01:13:46,732
an American‐held hostage
by ISIS?

1491
01:13:46,732 --> 01:13:48,002
‐ Yes and no.

1492
01:13:48,002 --> 01:13:50,202
Um...

1493
01:13:50,202 --> 01:13:52,302
It still could have
waited another day.

1494
01:13:52,302 --> 01:13:55,862
Um...

1495
01:13:55,862 --> 01:14:01,232
I mean, I´m all for finding
the American, definitely, but...

1496
01:14:01,232 --> 01:14:03,202
another day...

1497
01:14:03,202 --> 01:14:06,562
when they could have had backup

1498
01:14:06,562 --> 01:14:10,102
would have made a world
of difference.

1499
01:14:10,102 --> 01:14:12,862
We´d have four boys
back home, probably.

1500
01:14:12,862 --> 01:14:15,832
‐ If this was indeed
on my husband´s behalf,

1501
01:14:15,832 --> 01:14:18,632
I would have to say
thank you so very much.

Um...

1503
01:14:20,362 --> 01:14:22,702
I´m still I´m very sorry
it happened.

1504
01:14:24,762 --> 01:14:26,302
And that would be
a terrible burden

1505
01:14:26,302 --> 01:14:28,432
to know that people might die
in the attempt

1506
01:14:28,432 --> 01:14:30,662
to rescue my husband.

1507
01:14:30,662 --> 01:14:32,832

ran from their decision.

1728
01:26:03,302 --> 01:26:05,532
And did everything they could

1729
01:26:05,532 --> 01:26:08,702
to force the blame
down the ladder

1730
01:26:08,702 --> 01:26:11,462
as far as it could go.

1731
01:26:11,462 --> 01:26:13,202
MEEK:
Secretary Mattis wanted scalps.

1732
01:26:13,202 --> 01:26:14,332
I mean, we´ve heard that.

1733
01:26:14,332 --> 01:26:16,362
He was the Defense Secretary
at the time,

1734
01:26:16,362 --> 01:26:17,732
and he wanted accountability.

1735
01:26:17,732 --> 01:26:19,402
He wanted to pin blame
on people.

1736
01:26:19,402 --> 01:26:20,432

Where is the blame?

1739
01:26:23,062 --> 01:26:24,832
And it became very apparent

1740
01:26:24,832 --> 01:26:27,732
that there were certain levels
of the chain of command

1741
01:26:27,732 --> 01:26:29,262
that were being targeted

1742
01:26:29,262 --> 01:26:31,632

01:26:37,332 --> 01:26:39,602
Colonel Brad Moses ‐‐

1747
01:26:39,602 --> 01:26:43,762
my commander
and my commander´s commander.

1748
01:26:43,762 --> 01:26:46,162
MEEK: People close to
the investigation have told me

1749
01:26:46,162 --> 01:26:48,202
that the move to protect
higher‐ranking officers

1750
01:26:48,202 --> 01:26:49,832
began almost immediately.

1751
01:26:49,832 --> 01:26:51,702
Just a week after its launch,

1752
01:26:51,702 --> 01:26:54,932
General Waldhauser replaced
the lead investigator

1753
01:26:54,932 --> 01:26:59,532
with his own Chief of Staff,
Major General Roger Cloutier.

1754
01:26:59,532 --> 01:27:02,702
ROGER: In October of 2017,
General Waldhauser appointed me

1755
01:27:02,702 --> 01:27:05,362
to conduct an investigation
into the enemy attack

1756
01:27:05,362 --> 01:27:09,302
on U. S. and Nigerien forces
near Tongo Tongo in Niger.

1757
01:27:09,302 --> 01:27:12,532
My first responsibility was
to the families of the fallen.

1758
01:27:12,532 --> 01:27:15,232
DONALD: This is wrong.
This is wrong.

1759
01:27:15,232 --> 01:27:18,702
Using your chief of staff,
as much as I love the man,

1760
01:27:18,702 --> 01:27:22,032
to do the investigation
for AFRICOM.

1761
01:27:22,032 --> 01:27:24,432
The last thing we want
is AFRICOM

1762
01:27:24,432 --> 01:27:29,032
controlling an investigation
of themselves.

1763
01:27:29,032 --> 01:27:32,862
‐ The idea that the Secretary
of Defense let AFRICOM

1764
01:27:32,862 --> 01:27:37,132
investigate themselves here
and that the combatant commander

1765
01:27:37,132 --> 01:27:41,432
appointed his chief of staff
to look at this,

1766
01:27:41,432 --> 01:27:45,102
I felt was just unconscionable.

1767
01:27:45,102 --> 01:27:46,832
And their unwillingness

1768
01:27:46,832 --> 01:27:50,362
to look at those commanders
above the company level

1769
01:27:50,362 --> 01:27:53,902
is an egregious shortcoming

1770
01:27:53,902 --> 01:27:58,862
and dereliction
of their responsibilities

1771
01:27:58,862 --> 01:28:02,732
to really assess
what happened here.

1772
01:28:02,732 --> 01:28:05,562
‐ The investigation
was an attempt

1773
01:28:05,562 --> 01:28:10,362
to protect senior leaders
and their careers.

1774
01:28:10,362 --> 01:28:13,232
And a deliberate attempt

1775
01:28:13,232 --> 01:28:17,902
to hold the...company commander

1776
01:28:17,902 --> 01:28:19,502
and the detachment commander

1777
01:28:19,502 --> 01:28:23,262
and the team members
accountable.

1778
01:28:23,262 --> 01:28:25,532
‐ I was ultimately
held accountable.

1779
01:28:25,532 --> 01:28:29,432
I ultimately received
this reprimand.

1780
01:28:29,432 --> 01:28:31,462
"Memorandum
for Major Alan Van Saun

1781
01:28:31,462 --> 01:28:34,432
dated October 9, 2018.

1782
01:28:34,432 --> 01:28:36,862
You are hereby reprimanded
for failing to ensure

1783
01:28:36,862 --> 01:28:41,432
that the members of Operational
Detachment Alpha ODA 3212

1784
01:28:41,432 --> 01:28:43,302
were adequately trained

1785
01:28:43,302 --> 01:28:45,932
prior to conducting
combined operations

1786
01:28:45,932 --> 01:28:49,002
with a Nigerien partner force."

1787
01:28:49,002 --> 01:28:51,332
And then
Major General John Deedrick

1788
01:28:51,332 --> 01:28:53,002
came to visit me at the Pentagon

1789
01:28:53,002 --> 01:28:57,532
to give me the final results
of my punishment.

1790
01:28:57,532 --> 01:29:00,802
And he notified me
that, more or less,

1791
01:29:00,802 --> 01:29:04,432
my future in the Army was over.

1792
01:29:04,432 --> 01:29:08,562
So my words to him were, "Sir,
just so we´re straight here,

1793
01:29:08,562 --> 01:29:11,432
just so I understand
we´re on the same page,

1794
01:29:11,432 --> 01:29:14,332
you are essentially
ending my career

1795
01:29:14,332 --> 01:29:17,332
over something
that I was not part of,

1796
01:29:17,332 --> 01:29:19,902
nor did I have authority over."

1797
01:29:21,162 --> 01:29:26,902
"ODA 3212 was trained
and certified and validated

1798
01:29:26,902 --> 01:29:29,932
by Lieutenant Colonel Painter
and Colonel Moses."

1799
01:29:32,032 --> 01:29:34,902
Then he changed the topic,
asked if I had any questions.

1800
01:29:34,902 --> 01:29:37,702
We shook hands,
and I went on my way.

1801
01:29:37,702 --> 01:29:39,502
‐ Colonel Moses
and Colonel Painter

1802
01:29:39,502 --> 01:29:40,562
were not held accountable,

1803
01:29:40,562 --> 01:29:42,532
but they should have been
held accountable.

1804
01:29:42,532 --> 01:29:44,202
And the reason
they weren´t held accountable

1805
01:29:44,202 --> 01:29:46,102
is because
they´re card‐carrying,

1806
01:29:46,102 --> 01:29:49,502
you know, members of the club.

1807
01:29:49,502 --> 01:29:53,862
He was a scapegoat
to protect higher officers

1808
01:29:53,862 --> 01:29:57,302
from being punished.

1809
01:29:57,302 --> 01:29:59,602
MYESHIA:
They gave him a reprimand.

1810
01:29:59,602 --> 01:30:01,932
For what?
He wasn´t even much there.

1811
01:30:01,932 --> 01:30:05,132
His daughter is born
the same day my husband died,

1812
01:30:05,132 --> 01:30:09,632
and I´m pretty sure
that eats him up every day.

1813
01:30:09,632 --> 01:30:10,962
‐ It´s all about the club.

1814
01:30:10,962 --> 01:30:13,532
It´s all about protecting
the establishment.

1815

circling the wagons
around the senior leaders.

1817
01:30:18,032 --> 01:30:21,262
‐ They spent months
and months and months

1818
01:30:21,262 --> 01:30:24,602
trying to formulate a damn story

1819
01:30:24,602 --> 01:30:27,432
that they thought
would protect their ass.

1820
01:30:27,432 --> 01:30:29,102
‐ So that first mission
was the one

1821
01:30:29,102 --> 01:30:31,632
that was not
properly characterized.

1822
01:30:31,632 --> 01:30:34,802
It was characterized as a civil
military reconnaissance

1823
01:30:34,802 --> 01:30:38,802
when it was actually focused
on the ISIS‐GS sub‐commander.

1824
01:30:38,802 --> 01:30:41,362
MEEK: So if you were sitting
across from Roger Cloutier

1825
01:30:41,362 --> 01:30:44,062
right now instead of me...

1826
01:30:44,062 --> 01:30:47,032
‐ I´d say, "Get your ass
in the yard."

1827
01:30:47,032 --> 01:30:48,462
That´s exactly what I´d say.

1828
01:30:48,462 --> 01:30:51,862
And I´d try to beat
that son of a bitch to a pulp.

1829
01:30:51,862 --> 01:30:54,732
He would need medical assistance
to leave my house.

1830
01:30:56,362 --> 01:30:58,232
If I had to hit him
with a damn ball bat,

1831
01:30:58,232 --> 01:31:01,762
it wouldn´t matter.

1832

I think my dad...
He is, uh...

1898
01:35:24,862 --> 01:35:26,732
Throughout my career,
my brother´s career,

1899
01:35:26,732 --> 01:35:28,302
he´s kind of had
the same stance.

1900
01:35:28,302 --> 01:35:32,002
He´s proud of us
but doesn´t want it to be us.

1901
01:35:32,002 --> 01:35:34,662
And I get that.

1902
01:35:34,662 --> 01:35:39,032
To willingly watch
another son go down that path,

1903
01:35:39,032 --> 01:35:40,932
I can´t imagine
how hard it would be.

1905
01:35:43,262 --> 01:35:46,502
God is great, God is good.

1906

WILL: You know,
I am painfully aware

1911
01:36:02,132 --> 01:36:04,362
of what can happen
on the worst day.

1912
01:36:04,362 --> 01:36:05,402
It´s terrifying.

1913
01:36:05,402 --> 01:36:06,962
I mean, I...

1914
01:36:06,962 --> 01:36:09,102
I know what I stand to lose.

1915
01:36:09,102 --> 01:36:11,632
And that´s why I´m not
taking it for granted.

01:36:19,832 --> 01:36:23,462
I wasn´t called
to live a cautious life.

"I was built for the storm
and the calm doesn´t suit me."

1923
01:36:33,602 --> 01:36:37,032
So this is...

01:36:37,032 --> 01:36:38,462
where God has placed me.

1925

This is what
he´s put on my heart.

This is where he called me,

1927
01:36:42,202 --> 01:36:44,132
and I´m gonna see it through.
