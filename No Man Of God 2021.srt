3
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,360
At that Florida department
of corrections facility

4
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:27,486
in stark, Florida,

5
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,196
the signal has now come

6
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:31,698
shortly after 7:00 this morning,

7
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,116
eastern time.

8
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,202
The signal came
from the witness window

9
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:37,287
at the facility there
that Ted Bundy,

10
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:39,790
convicted killer
of a 12-year-old girl,

11
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:42,084
rape and murder of her in 1978,

12
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,044
had died in the electric chair.

13
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:47,798
Many of those outside the prison
who had maintained a vigil

14
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:49,216
broke into cheers

15
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:51,635
following the signal
that Bundy was dead.

16
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:53,095
After exhausting

17
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,763
a series of appeals
that lasted 10 years,

18
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:56,473
Ted Bundy is dead.

19
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,804
Bundy: If it was...

20
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,306
Something I could use,
I would use it.

21
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:04,017
I would learn their routine...

22
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:05,894
When they got home from work,

23
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,771
how often
they went out to dinner,

24
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:11,108
how often they ordered takeout.

25
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:14,820
If they had a boyfriend,
when would he stop by?

26
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,532
Did she have a dog? Did it bark?

27
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:21,493
Those are the things
I would learn.

28
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,787
Then on the night
of the full moon,

29
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,664
I would make my approach.

30
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,332
The full moon is key.

31
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,626
You show a woman a badge
at night,

32
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,336
know some real details
about her,

33
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,296
she'll follow you right
to your car.

34
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,525
That's where I would hit her
over the head with a tire iron

35
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,635
hidden in the bumper
behind the wheel well.

36
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,929
Once she was out,
I would drive her out

37
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:43,849
to a spot I'd picked out
weeks before,

38
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,060
secluded, wooded, no traffic,

39
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:49,563
where no one would see my car.

40
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,525
Bundy: That's what I would do,
if I did it.

41
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,611
But I didn't.

42
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:40,113
I'm innocent of the crimes
for which I've been convicted,

43
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:43,241
as well as those
I'm suspected of.

44
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,161
I'm an innocent man.

45
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,639
I was at Roger's
right before Korea

46
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,098
with my first wife.

47
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,810
It wasn't my wife.
They buried the pig.

48
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:13,355
Glad to hear that.
We're all here.

49
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,440
And as you all know,

50
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,651
no good deed goes unpunished.

51
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,362
You guys did such a fine job

52
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,073
with the first
36 research interviews.

53
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,367
The deputy director
wants another 36.

54
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,160
- Oh, so generous.
- Depue: So...

55
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,829
We're gonna expand our list

56
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,791
to include serial rapists,
child molesters,

57
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,835
and any of the serial murders

58
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,670
we didn't get to
the first time around.

59
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:39,172
So, we put together
a tentative wish list.

60
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:42,801
You guys all know the drill.
You volunteer or be volunteered.

61
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,720
First up is berkowitz. Myers.

62
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,597
I got friends on the staff
up in attica.

63
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,266
- I'll take a run at him.
- Man: Take it.

64
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,934
Sounds good. Bittaker.

65
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:53,645
I'll take bittaker.
Worked the guy before.

66
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,313
You got some family
in California,

67
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,815
- don't you?
- Man: Yeah, Cali boy.

68
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,733
I saw your hand shoot up there
really quick.

69
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:02,487
You j... you just want to
go to California. Alright.

70
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:03,965
- Man: Got your number, bud.
- Alright.

71
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,658
Hold on here. Bundy.

72
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,909
Man: No one's taking that.

73
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,786
- No.
- Depue: Anyone.

74
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:12,163
No way.

75
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,500
Yeah, I'll take him.

76
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,253
Don't waste your time, bro.
He won't talk to you.

77
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,213
He hates feds.
He won't talk to any of us.

78
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:21,965
I can always give it a shot.

79
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,277
- Man: Yeah, give it a shot.
- I've been fortunate in the past

80
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:27,095
with developing informants
that nobody thought would talk.

81
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:29,055
We're all familiar
with your record.

82
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,433
So why don't you meet with me
after the meeting,

83
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,934
and we'll discuss this, okay?

84
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:33,977
Yes, sir.

85
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,564
Look, Roger,
I don't want to buck.

86
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:39,065
I'm the new guy here.

87
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,734
I don't want to step
on anyone's toes.

88
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,402
He's not gonna confess
to anything,

89
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:44,487
but even the simplest thing,
it might slip through.

90
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,781
Look, there are families
out there looking for answers,

91
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,867
and if we can provide
closure for just one,

92
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,994
it'll be worthwhile.

93
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,412
Alright.

94
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,289
I'll have them
pull the files for you.

95
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,374
Oh, um...

96
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,251
Just the biography,

97
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,378
not the crime scene photos.

98
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,435
Hagmaier.

99
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:16,561
Man: Hey, bill. It's will.

100
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,104
I reached out to the warden

101
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,624
about getting you
into that interview.

102
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:21,125
- Did you talk to him?
- Man: Yeah, I did.

103
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,984
Bundy wants you
to write him a letter.

104
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,444
Write him a what?!

105
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,947
Man: A letter.
Who knows with this guy.

106
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,257
Can you get it done by tomorrow?

107
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,908
Yeah, sure.

108
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,202
- I can do that.
- Man: Great.

109
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,287
You get it to me.
I'll get it to Bundy.

110
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,538
Yeah. Alright.

111
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,874
- Thanks, will.
- Man: Yeah.

112
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,150
Agent bill hagmaier.

113
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,027
- Officer: Sign here.
- Mm-hmm.

114
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,295
Officer: You've got
to check your weapon.

115
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,363
Hagmaier: Okay.

116
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,657
Warden: Agent,
he's not gonna talk to you.

117
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,659
He hates the feds.

118
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,536
We've exchanged letters.

119
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:59,581
He has expressed interest.

120
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,499
[Sighing 1 oh.

121
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:11,092
Yeah.
I need you to talk to Bundy.

122
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,969
I have an agent, uh...

123
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,055
- Hagmaier.
- Agent hagmaier.

124
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,599
Says he wants to talk to him
or something.

125
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,116
Yeah. No, that's what I said.

126
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,562
Okay. Call me back.

127
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,900
A while back,
a TV network offered him $50,000

128
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,568
to do a special.

129
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,695
He turned them down.

130
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,615
So, he's not going to do
something like this for free.

131
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,410
Yeah.

132
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,292
Well, put him on.

133
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,169
I don't give a good god damn
what he's doing.

134
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,670
Put him on the phone.

135
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:53,510
Yeah, Bundy.
Are you sure about this?

136
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,595
Because I don't want
any goddamn bullshit

137
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,722
splattering on my desk over it.

138
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,276
You'd think
you're smarter than him.

139
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,545
You think
you're gonna be the one

140
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,196
that's gonna get him to confess?

141
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,657
I don't think I'm smarter, sir.

142
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,742
I don't think you necessarily
have to be smarter.

143
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,870
This is what's going to happen,
agent hagmaier.

144
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:22,372
Ted Bundy will come down.

145
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,249
He'll toy with you
for a little while.

146
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,834
He will cat and mouse with you.

147
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:29,921
He will make you think
you are getting somewhere.

148
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:33,091
Then he's gonna leave you there,

149
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,759
go back to his cell,

150
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,679
and jerk off at the memory.

151
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,181
Well, at least that'll give me
something to write about.

152
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,719
Officer: You know the drill.

153
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,213
Well, say something.

154
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,572
You came to talk to me,

155
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,866
Mr. Bundy,
I'm special agent hagmaier.

156
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,993
I know who you are.

157
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,870
Well, I'm grateful

158
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,164
for you to take the time
to see me today.

159
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,999
We're compiling
a series of interviews

160
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,959
to try to find common threads

161
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,462
in the way that people think,

162
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:56,007
and we're finding it...
Very helpful to get an idea

163
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,509
of what people in your...

164
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,803
Situation...

165
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,264
Well,
what their childhoods were like,

166
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,141
what brings out
their aggression,

167
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,268
what makes them angry?

168
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,525
My situation?

169
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,028
Your situation is quite unique

170
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,530
in that you also have,
from what I understand,

171
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:23,284
an interest in the psychology
of serial murderers.

172
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,994
I do.

173
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:27,097
You've been writing to
an investigator up in Seattle.

174
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,164
Uh, yes.

175
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,124
You mean the green river thing?

176
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:34,087
Yeah, that's a really
interesting case.

177
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,506
I don't have, uh,
access to everything,

178
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:39,425
but i-I've started to piece
some things together.

179
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,553
And that thought process is why
I wanted to speak with you.

180
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,430
Not, it isn't.

181
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,307
Th-this is purely academic.

182
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:49,060
Bundy: I know this is.

183
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,188
You FBI guys,
you're all the same.

184
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,899
You think you're better than me.

185
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,567
You're all just hoover disciples

186
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,736
riding through
on your high horses,

187
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:02,907
thinking you've got
the biggest brains in the room.

188
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,784
If you're so smart,
why aren't you bagging

189
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:07,078
serial killers left and right?

190
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,664
Why doesn't witness protection
actually work?

191
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,916
If you testify,
we'll Grant you immunity,

192
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,435
and you can go
into witness protection.

193
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,461
Live out your life
in a quaint small town.

194
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,672
But it never works.
They always get killed.

195
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,758
- You can't protect them.
- Well, witness protection is...

196
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,386
You are liars in cheap suits
on government salaries,

197
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,722
and everything is
an elaborate trap with you,

198
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,807
all so you can
retire on a pension

199
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:29,689
- and write your damn book.
- Look, I'm just...

200
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:33,438
No, no, no! You...
Sell that to the tourists.

201
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,332
You can never trust an FBI man.

202
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,774
Not for a goddamn minute.

203
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:41,279
Mr. Bundy...
Is this meeting over?

204
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,990
No, sir, we were
just getting started.

205
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,701
Mr. Hagmaier,
is this meeting over?

206
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,995
No, no, we're just having a...

207
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:51,748
Friendly conversation
on the state of the bureau.

208
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,769
If you get up and put
your fingers in his face again,

209
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,146
you won't be using them
for a year.

210
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,255
Bundy: Yes, sir.

211
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,976
You could've buried me there.

212
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,412
Do you know what
they would have done to me?

213
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:16,647
Yeah, I have a pretty good idea.

214
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:20,360
Look, I don't want
to get you on anything.

215
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,862
I'm not even gonna ask
if you killed anybody.

216
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:24,947
It doesn't matter to me.

217
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,617
W-Why would you want
to talk to me specifically?

218
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:31,162
Look, we both have
psychology degrees.

219
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,873
You almost have a law degree.

220
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:37,001
You have more education
than I do.

221
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:40,421
I know the guys on the row
come to you looking for advice.

222
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:43,132
And you help them
with their appeals.

223
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:46,469
We trust you.
They tell you things.

224
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,429
I'm not gonna ask you
anyone's secrets.

225
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:49,847
I-I just...

226
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,600
I just want to recruit you
to help me see

227
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,322
if we're going down
the right road on this.

228
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:55,770
Are we asking
the right questions?

229
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:58,523
Are we looking
at the right people?

230
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:03,444
I'm not here
looking for evidence.

231
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:06,572
I'm looking for understanding.

232
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,658
I don't know what you know.

233
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,326
I don't see what you see.

234
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,912
I don't hear what you hear.

235
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:14,181
I don't think you'd tell me
the truth,

236
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:15,456
even if I did ask you.

237
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,792
I'm just...
I got to start somewhere.

238
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,549
Why do they send you down here?

239
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,230
Why didn't they bring
the prima Donnas in?

240
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,678
Why didn't they send in
Montgomery or Douglas?

241
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,364
Well, they didn't even think
you'd talk to us.

242
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,432
- Bundy: Why, because I had feds?
- Yeah.

243
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,725
I don't know where
they get that idea about me.

244
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,314
I'll tell you what.

245
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,209
I bet they think they would
do a better job than you.

246
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,318
I bet you're right about that.
I'm just the rookie.

247
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,529
So, this is what
I get from the FBI, huh?

248
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,406
A god damn rookie.

249
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,786
Let me ask you something.

250
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,204
Shoot.

251
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:57,081
Bundy: What do you think
about this thing...

252
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,834
The pornography
and violent crime?

253
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,627
I read dietz's article about it.

254
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,713
- Which one?
- The one from the bsu.

255
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,423
How do you know about that?

256
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,429
Where'd you get all this?

257
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,973
These are FBI bulletins.
Even I don't have some of this.

258
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:16,726
It's some
pretty heavy reading material.

259
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,394
I'm impressed.

260
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:19,604
Do you have playboys, too.

261
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,481
That's what the scrum have.

262
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,608
I-I-I didn't mean to imply...

263
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,902
Do you really think playboy
makes people do these things?

264
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,446
- No.
- Neither do I.

265
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,332
I'll tell you what
the real bad pornography is.

266
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:43,920
The marriage of pleasure
with the thrill of control.

267
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,796
The real danger isn't

268
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,550
watching a woman get undressed
or reading a playboy.

269
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:52,678
It's someone having the
euphoric feeling of having sex

270
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,806
and hurting someone
at the same time,

271
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:59,810
like in the detective magazines.

272
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,665
The ones with the girls
on the front covers

273
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,816
with their breasts
falling out of their dress

274
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:09,195
while someone garrots them
from behind.

275
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:12,323
"Read the true story
of one killer's obsession."

276
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,200
Exactly.

277
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,285
You know what those
are really good for, though?

278
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,788
- What?
- Learning how not to get caught.

279
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,540
I imagine they would be.

280
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,501
They are instruction manuals
on how to get away with it.

281
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,882
So, did you read a lot
of those growing up?

282
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:32,802
No, no, I never read them.

283
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,304
Bundy: So how did you
end up in the FBI?

284
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:36,889
I think we should focus on...

285
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:38,766
- On me?
- Yeah.

286
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:41,102
You asked me to trust you, bill.

287
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,229
But I don't know you from Adam.

288
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,401
I ended up in the FBI
by accident.

289
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,027
Oh, bullshit.

290
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,838
You've got to have a degree.
What's you get it for?

291
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,281
I wanted to be
a guidance counselor.

292
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,949
Oh, no. No way.

293
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,410
Hagmaier: Seriously.
A guidance counselor.

294
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,539
How does a guidance counselor
end up in the FBI?

295
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,125
Two weeks after I graduated,
I was drafted.

296
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,210
- You want to 'nam?
- No.

297
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:09,714
No, my brother was over there
and had just been shot.

298
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,591
That bullet spared me
from having to go over.

299
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,092
So, what did you do?

300
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:15,386
I ended up as a counselor
at a military prison.

301
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:18,306
And someone there
was a serial killer.

302
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,600
Hagmaier: A few.

303
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,268
Did you counsel them?

304
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,353
Some.

305
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,647
I bet you never wanted
for a thing in your life.

306
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:28,107
What did your dad do?

307
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:30,610
Investment banking,
upper management.

308
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:31,902
Mailman.

309
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:36,574
Happy childhood?

310
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:39,702
Were you close to him?

311
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:42,622
He was a drunk.

312
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:45,541
Okay.

313
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,461
Moving on.

314
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,920
Once you got in the FBI,

315
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,006
you chased a job in the bsu?

316
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:54,300
No, I was recommended.

317
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:56,844
Like I said,
I ended up here by accident.

318
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:59,138
You broke a big case.

319
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,806
I contributed.

320
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,266
Serial killer?

321
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,104
No, I-I developed a ci
on an armored car robbery

322
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,773
that no one thought would talk.

323
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,524
He gave us everything we needed.

324
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,401
- That New York thing.
- Yeah.

325
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:15,738
Oh!

326
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,658
That is the biggest
armored car heist in history.

327
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,369
I've read about you.
You're no rookie.

328
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,245
You're some hotshot
young upstart,

329
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,664
and I'm your next big case.

330
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,099
You're gonna be
the guy who broke me.

331
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,750
- No.
- Bundy: Come on.

332
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:29,502
You can't bullshit
a bullshitter.

333
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,213
I'm not. I'm a scientist.

334
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,590
I-I just want to understand.

335
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:36,509
Oh, you want to understand.

336
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:45,184
Well, I'll tell you...

337
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:48,521
You and your colleagues
out there...

338
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,481
The investigators,
the detectives,

339
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:56,195
You're like fisherman
out on the water.

340
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:58,989
You throw your bait in.

341
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,908
You're trying
to catch your fish.

342
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,079
The smaller fish,

343
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:07,373
the inexperienced ones,

344
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:09,875
the ones who are still
driven by their ego,

345
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:13,003
wemtheytegonna fightforthal

346
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,648
they're gonna swim up,
and they're going to try

347
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:16,382
and get that hook.

348
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:20,511
They don't know it's a hook
because they're stupid.

349
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,805
They're arrogant.

350
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:27,184
And you'll... you'll catch
a lot of those fish,

351
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,519
but occasionally,

352
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,563
your bait will sink
a little lower,

353
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,523
to the middle level,

354
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:35,234
and that's where
the medium-sized fish are.

355
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:38,028
And they're hard to catch.

356
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,530
You only catch them
when they're lazy

357
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,240
or their egos get
the better of them.

358
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:44,493
You get them. You pull them up.

359
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,162
You mount them on your wall.

360
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:50,291
You get you press conference.
You write your book.

361
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:53,002
But deep down...

362
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,087
In the deepest
depths of the sea,

363
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:57,214
is where the biggest fish are.

364
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:02,219
And you have no idea
how big they are.

365
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,973
You have no idea how long
they've been down there.

366
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:08,350
They see everything.

367
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:11,812
They watch everything.

368
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:15,232
Sometimes, they eat
the smaller fish.

369
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,151
But they don't take the bait.

370
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:21,989
The only way you can catch them

371
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,908
is to become one of them.

372
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,497
And you can't do that.

373
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,377
You won't do that.

374
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:41,217
Not yet.

375
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,302
Maybe someday...

376
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:45,429
If I can trust you...

377
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,560
I'll take you
under the water with me.

378
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:54,313
You can see how deep
all this goes.

379
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:06,283
Officer: Mr. Bundy, it's time.

380
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,345
- We're done anyway.
- Would you like me to come back

381
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:10,204
to continue this conversation?

382
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:13,332
Ah, we'll see.

383
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:16,085
Maybe I'll write you a letter
or something.

384
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:23,050
Oh, but if you do come back...

385
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:25,803
Could you bring me some gum?

386
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:28,097
-Well, that's contraband,
-yeah, I know.

387
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,974
The wrappers.

388
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:33,519
Look, maybe you can
talk to the warden.

389
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:35,437
I'll see what I can do.

390
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:51,787
So, did you get anything
we could use?

391
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:55,124
But I got a pretty good
read on them.

392
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,667
Depue: Yeah.

393
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,549
You think he's capable
of all the other murders

394
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:00,421
he's suspected of?

395
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,089
Oh, he's...
He's guilty, alright.

396
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:05,426
- He all but admitted it to me.
- You're kidding me.

397
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,803
Hagmaier: He wouldn't
say he did it.

398
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:10,055
He won't. Not yet.

399
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,349
But he wanted me
to know he did it.

400
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,435
He's proud...

401
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:15,769
Proud of what he's done,

402
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,855
but even more so
that we can't prove it.

403
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,440
What do you think he wants?

404
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,525
Well, he says he wants me
to bring down case files

405
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,193
so he can help profile.

406
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,653
What do you say?

407
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:26,864
I say
it's more complicated than that.

408
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,782
I think you should
keep pulling at that thread

409
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,659
and see what's
at the other end of it.

410
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:33,162
Okay.

411
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:35,456
Bundy: Man, how many times
do I have to tell you?

412
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:38,417
I've got nothing else to say.

413
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:40,085
Man: Here you go, bill.

414
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,337
Thanks, Tom.

415
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,540
Hello.

416
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,834
Hello.

417
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:09,758
- You remembered?
- I did.

418
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,678
The warden was very particular
about the wrappers,

419
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,972
but since you played
nice last time,

420
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:16,223
he made an exception.

421
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:18,308
Spearmint.

422
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,977
How'd you know
it was my favorite?

423
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:21,478
I didn't.

424
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,625
That is very good.

425
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:49,256
So, tell me, what's the,
uh, tape recorder for?

426
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:51,341
I thought we'd talk
about some cases.

427
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,302
And you need a tape recorder
for that?

428
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:56,305
Well, you have a unique window
into this world,

429
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:58,324
and there's a good chance
you'll say a great many things

430
00:25:58,348 --> 00:25:59,767
that I'd like a record of.

431
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,435
Okay.

432
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:04,646
- But if I say shut it off.
- It goes off.

433
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,732
Well, press record,

434
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:09,485
and let's get this
party started.

435
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:12,237
I'm gonna save this.

436
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:15,157
It is February 13, 1986.

437
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:16,825
This is agent bill hagmaier.

438
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:17,993
I'm sitting with Theodore...

439
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:19,036
No, Ted.

440
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:22,372
I'm sitting with Ted Bundy.

441
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,041
Bundy: Where do you wanna start?

442
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,918
Uh, I thought we'd
start with green river.

443
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,419
Bundy: I feel like
there's something

444
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:29,505
I could add
to the investigation.

445
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:32,424
I understand why they can't show
me pictures or tell me things,

446
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:35,677
but if I could just see some
of those crime scene photos,

447
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,489
I think it would be something
of a revelation.

448
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:39,765
I could see some of the changes

449
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:41,034
that this guy was going through,

450
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:43,018
at least on a superficial level.

451
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,312
Hagmaier: Superficial?

452
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,689
This is a person that
we're looking for here,

453
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,399
assuming that
it's just one person.

454
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,736
This is a living, breathing,
viable human being,

455
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:54,696
who's just going about his life

456
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,657
in a way
that makes sense to him.

457
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,742
He isn't some kind of monster

458
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,619
because he wasn't
at the beginning.

459
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:03,330
He's sick, demented, sure.

460
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:07,709
But... when you start
using jargon like that,

461
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,795
those impassioned terms,

462
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:13,006
you forget that there's
a lot of him that in you.

463
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,217
I don't know about that.

464
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:17,594
There is nothing
that this guy has thought

465
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,931
that you haven't thought
at one time or another.

466
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,850
What, he's just...

467
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,602
Taking it a step further
for one reason or another.

468
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,105
Well, sure.

469
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:31,567
They're crediting him
with 36 now.

470
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,735
And yet, he's still
avoided detection,

471
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:36,405
even with a vulnerable
victim class like prostitutes.

472
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:38,907
Not a real high-risk crime
for the offender.

473
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:42,035
Still bold as hell.

474
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,538
I'm amazed at some
of his crassness and luck,

475
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,373
going back to the same area,

476
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:49,293
even while all hell
was breaking loose.

477
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,919
All of the girls being

478
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:52,379
fully aware
of what was going on,

479
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:53,648
he still managed to get victims,

480
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,675
and then he just stops?

481
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:59,803
Now, do you think a person
like that can just stop?

482
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:03,140
It's unlikely,
though, if he did,

483
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:05,601
maybe he was exhausted.

484
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,269
Exhausted?

485
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:09,062
Do you have any idea

486
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,773
what a spree like this
would take out of you?

487
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:14,067
It's...

488
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,612
Too big a bite, man.
Too big a bite.

489
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:19,781
- I can't even begin to imagine.
- Yes, you can.

490
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,886
Do you think I don't know
why you're asking me

491
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,328
about this stuff?

492
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,580
What do you mean?

493
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:28,665
About the murders
in the pacific northwest,

494
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,250
well, you said in your letters

495
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:31,936
that you wanted to discuss
the green river case?

496
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,963
Do you want to ask me
about, um, Utah next,

497
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:37,424
or Florida or Idaho.

498
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:40,761
- What's in Idaho?
- Bundy: I'm just naming states.

499
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:43,388
Look, i-I'm here to talk to you

500
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,724
about anything
you'd like to talk about.

501
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:58,070
Do you think there's a point
in a person's progression

502
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:02,449
where they... they say,
"this is my life's work.

503
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:03,909
This is what I need to do"?

504
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:07,663
Or do you think
it's a gradual escalation?

505
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:09,957
You know, it's gradual.

506
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,917
It's like a... a skier

507
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:15,462
who has been dreaming about
skiing their whole life.

508
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:16,797
They read the magazines.

509
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,257
They watch the movies
about skiing.

510
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:19,925
They think about it
all the time.

511
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:23,720
And one day, they just say,
"I got to try that."

512
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,348
Right, and some people will
start on the very steep hill,

513
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,825
and some will start
on the bunny slope.

514
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,268
Some people take lessons.

515
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:36,441
What's your thumbnail sketch
of the guy?

516
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:43,865
Well, I wouldn't go so far
as to say how old he is

517
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:46,994
or anything like that, but...

518
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:50,539
He's either unemployed
or works part time.

519
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,128
Based on the frequency
of his killing,

520
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,088
the fact that his victims

521
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:02,301
were taken every single
night of the week...

522
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:07,615
Indicates that
he doesn't really have

523
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,183
much of a schedule to adhere to.

524
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,768
Well, he's not married.

525
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,410
Probably doesn't have
a steady girlfriend

526
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:16,356
or anything that puts
regular demands on his time.

527
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,195
That's some solid profiling,

528
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:26,366
and you did that just with
some newspaper clippings.

529
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:28,285
Will you turn the tape off?

530
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,378
You know they think I'm crazy.

531
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,215
I'm tired of people
saying I'm crazy.

532
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,800
I'm tired of reading
psychiatrists

533
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,094
and some of your
FBI prima Donnas say

534
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:48,555
that you have to have
some sort of complex

535
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:51,975
in order to kill people.

536
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:54,311
Normal people kill people.

537
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:04,738
Say...

538
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:09,326
What's the worst thing that
you remember about your father?

539
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:10,577
What do you mean?

540
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:12,746
Well, you told me you hated him.

541
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:14,664
What's the worst thing
you remember?

542
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:26,885
Our house had a basement.

543
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:30,222
It was the only place to play
when my dad got home from work.

544
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:33,809
He like quiet
while he watched the shows.

545
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:37,979
One summer,
a rat moved into the basement.

546
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:40,690
I could hear it constantly.

547
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,359
Always chewing.

548
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:45,737
Always scratching.

549
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,823
It attacked me once.

550
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,699
Darn thing bit me.

551
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,993
I ran upstairs crying,

552
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:55,205
my dad, he didn't like me
interrupting his shows,

553
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:58,708
so he... he got up
and grabbed a baseball bat.

554
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,960
He hit you?

555
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:03,964
No, he went down the stairs.

556
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:06,675
I could hear him cursing
through the floor,

557
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:11,263
and he battered the basement.

558
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,765
A few minutes later,
he came upstairs,

559
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:16,059
bat covered in blood,
lean it against this chair,

560
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:18,061
went back to his beer.

561
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:20,689
Told me to go downstairs
to clean it.

562
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:24,109
I went down there and...

563
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:28,321
The worst thing wasn't
the blood or that smashed rat.

564
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:35,120
It was the silence.

565
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:37,372
I-I couldn't
hear the rat anymore.

566
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:41,126
I couldn't hear the scratching
or the chewing.

567
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:44,880
Any time I went down there
after that, it was quiet.

568
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,632
I-I stopped going down there
after that.

569
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,555
You missed the rat.

570
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,684
Yeah, I guess.

571
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,398
Do you think
you could kill somebody?

572
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:09,237
I think you could.

573
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,740
Well, I'm an FBI agent.

574
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,867
I carry a gun, got a badge.

575
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:15,785
That's not what I'm saying.

576
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,253
Every morning, I say a prayer.

577
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:27,881
I put on my gun and my badge,

578
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:30,383
and I ask god
for the strength and wisdom

579
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,219
to know when to pull the trigger

580
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,804
and not one second sooner
and not one second later.

581
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,932
Thafsnotwhatrnlasmng, enhen

582
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,605
could you kill somebody?

583
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:54,491
Yeah, I could.

584
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:58,453
And I could get away with it to.

585
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:00,956
I'm at least as strong as you.

586
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:04,084
Probably like sex
as much as you do.

587
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,628
I know how to dispose of a body,

588
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,505
how not to be noticed,

589
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:11,925
how to get in and out
and leave a scene looking

590
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:15,095
like it belongs to a series
of other murderers.

591
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:21,810
But that's not who I am.

592
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,937
I wouldn't do that.

593
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:29,442
But you could do it.

594
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,945
Yeah. Yeah, I could.

595
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:34,573
Are you crazy?

596
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:37,701
I don't think so.

597
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,412
Well, neither am I.

598
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,163
You understand that?

599
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:45,208
I understood that the first
moment I walked in here.

600
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,876
You're already better
at your job

601
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,170
than most of the guys
you work with.

602
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,758
They all think I'm looney tunes.

603
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:38,011
Depue: I hear
he's sending you letters

604
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:39,679
pretty regularly.

605
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,765
He likes to talk,
likes to be heard.

606
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:45,101
Just how close are
you two getting?

607
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,978
Hagmaier: What is that
supposed to mean?

608
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:50,106
Depue: I mean, I hear rumors.

609
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,983
Watch yourself.

610
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:54,069
When you get too close
to a guy like this,

611
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,780
you can lose your way.

612
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,699
Hagmaier: Okay. Okay.

613
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:02,702
So then the teacher says,
"it's imagination time.

614
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:05,622
Today, we're gonna pretend
to be like animals."

615
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:09,209
And so she goes, "little susie,
what is a lion like?"

616
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,920
And little susie rears up
and slashes a paw forward

617
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:13,380
and goes rawr!

618
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,048
She's like,
"that's great, little susie."

619
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,759
So then she's like,
"Billy, what is a Turkey like?"

620
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:19,844
And he flaps his wings
all around the room.

621
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,726
Gobble! Gobble! Gobble!
Gobble! Gobble! Gobble!

622
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:25,266
And then she gets to Brian,
and she says, "Brian,

623
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,726
what is an elephant like?"

624
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:28,812
And Brian stops.

625
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,480
He thinks about it for a second,

626
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:32,899
and he stands up,

627
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:36,027
and he drops his britches
and drawers right then and there

628
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:38,530
and starts crab walking
around the room,

629
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,615
going, "brr, I'm an elephant!

630
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:45,829
Brr!"

631
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,123
- Wait, how old was he?
- 4.

632
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,600
Did you get the call,
or did your wife?

633
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,668
It was her. She was not happy.

634
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,545
Jesus, your son
sounds like a hoot.

635
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,422
Hagmaier: Oh, he's a good kid.

636
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,756
He's got to be, what,

637
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:58,800
six months or so
older than Rosa.

638
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:02,137
- How old's your boy now?
- 5.

639
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:04,264
That sounds about right.

640
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:12,063
What do you imagine
they're doing right now?

641
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:15,400
You know,
while their daddies talk murder.

642
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:18,111
I haven't seen her.

643
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:19,821
I don't, uh...

644
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:25,785
I don't know what she does.

645
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:28,913
I like to imagine that
she's got a nice Dollhouse,

646
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:32,250
but she goes out
riding her bike.

647
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:36,963
But then I also hope
that she's careful, you know?

648
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,509
A lot of dangerous men
in the world.

649
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:44,220
Too many.

650
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,930
Do you have a picture?

651
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:56,608
She's beautiful.

652
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,485
She takes after her mother,

653
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,361
have you seen her mother
recently?

654
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:03,948
Not in a few months.

655
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:10,079
I miss the hell out of them.

656
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:13,208
- Rosa's getting to that age.
- Hagmaier: That age?

657
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:17,796
When she understands
what people say about me.

658
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:20,089
Yeah, well, how do you even
explain that to a child?

659
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,342
Bundy: How do you explain that
to an adult?

660
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,552
Full grown adults walk around
that don't understand

661
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:26,012
that they shouldn't believe

662
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:28,515
everything that they hear
in the press.

663
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,850
How can you expect
a 4 year old to?

664
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:36,356
Does your son know what you do?

665
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:39,108
He knows his daddy
protects people.

666
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,780
Well...

667
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,698
Rose's daddy...

668
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:49,452
Well, he doesn't.

669
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:58,503
Did you get that letter I sent.

670
00:38:58,545 --> 00:38:59,754
Hagmaier: The latest one?

671
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:02,048
Is that the one about the girl

672
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:04,425
- who sends you the pictures?
- Yeah.

673
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,928
I mean, a lot of women
send photographs.

674
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,221
Hagmaier: Well, not like these.

675
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,641
I don't know where you would go

676
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:13,935
to get something
like these developed.

677
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:16,646
The wall of your cell must
be quite a sight to see.

678
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:18,064
Oh, I don't keep them.

679
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:22,443
No, I trade them
to other inmates for favors,

680
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,946
- commissary and the like.
- You don't like them?

681
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:27,907
I always know there will be more
in the next day's mail.

682
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,336
Turn the tape off.

683
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,304
I don't think I can
do this anymore.

684
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:52,432
Why not?

685
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:55,393
|... [ sighs 1

686
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:57,687
you're getting inside my head,

687
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:59,522
I don't like people
being inside my head.

688
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,542
- I'm not inside your head.
- You're so full of it.

689
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,067
- No...
- I bet you think you know

690
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:05,403
what I would do
if I broke out of this place.

691
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:06,881
- Hagmaier: I don't.
- Yeah, but you do.

692
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:08,323
I bet you think you do.

693
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,074
Tell me.

694
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:11,343
Tell me what
you think I would do

695
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,244
if I broke out of this place.

696
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:24,297
Well, the first thing
you would do is steal a car.

697
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:30,845
Then you'd probably head up
to the state of Washington.

698
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:33,765
You'd probably remove
a couple of people

699
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:37,101
- that are under your skin now.
- Yeah. Who?

700
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:40,647
Maybe a... an investigator

701
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,315
that's pissing you off.

702
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:44,817
Not returning the letters.

703
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,694
Maybe a journalist

704
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:48,780
who's been...

705
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:51,282
Unkind.

706
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:54,243
Then there's somebody else.
I don't know.

707
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:59,958
A guy you think is
having sex with your wife.

708
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,920
Then you'd steal another car,

709
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,380
slip over the border
into Canada,

710
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,298
and never, ever come out.

711
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:11,010
We'd never hear from you
ever again.

712
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:12,679
Fuck you!

713
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:40,707
You can turn the tape back on.

714
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,667
Hagmaier: A-are you sure?

715
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:45,420
I wouldn't know what else
to do with my time.

716
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:50,049
You could write another book.

717
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:51,968
Oh, never again.

718
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,219
That didn't work out.

719
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:54,679
It was a bestseller

720
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:56,347
Bundy:
We did correctly anticipate

721
00:41:56,389 --> 00:42:00,309
the baser desires
of the book-buying public.

722
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:03,271
They do want to be titillated.

723
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:05,165
There were people who read that
for genuine reasons,

724
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:07,859
- but they were misled.
- How so?

725
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,737
Well, it's a funny thing
when money gets involved,

726
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:14,449
and people do things for money
that they ordinarily wouldn't.

727
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,701
And those guys, they wanted me
to talk about things

728
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:18,077
that I was suspected of,

729
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:19,620
and I was like,
"I can't do that.

730
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:22,540
All I can do is speculate."

731
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:24,292
Anybody who read those books

732
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,627
knows nothing about me
or what actually happened.

733
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:28,755
Well, there are other people
who wrote books

734
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:31,382
who knew you before
any alleged criminal activity,

735
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:32,842
and they felt they knew you.

736
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:35,762
- You mean Ann rule?
- Do you remember her?

737
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:37,472
Vividly.

738
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:41,017
In her own way,
she's a very nice person.

739
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:43,936
All we did was share shifts
at call-in crisis center.

740
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,605
We never saw each other
socially.

741
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,023
My former fiancee,

742
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:48,983
girlfriend, friend,
what have you, Liz,

743
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:50,443
she wrote a book about me.

744
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:52,278
She had a far, far
better opportunity

745
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,529
to get to know me.

746
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,448
Better than Diane Edwards?

747
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:01,245
Diane is a lovely person.

748
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,748
But we were only just friends.

749
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,833
We never lived together.

750
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:09,796
Now, Liz, she saw me day in
and day out for years.

751
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,047
Well, Diane is referred to

752
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:12,715
as someone you cared
very deeply for.

753
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:14,550
There are a lot
of theories about me

754
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:18,638
that are just
a bunch of bull crap.

755
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,439
Well, people think that
Diana and I broke up,

756
00:43:20,473 --> 00:43:23,309
and somehow this was the...

757
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:27,480
Traumatic episode in my life
that made me go over the edge.

758
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:29,774
But...

759
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:31,651
It's simply not true.

760
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:33,986
It's completely untrue.

761
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:38,366
I know in my heart

762
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:41,119
that that episode
was not important.

763
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:46,707
Now you have Liz, friends,
family, relatives...

764
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,918
They're all reexamining
our relationships.

765
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,046
You know, they're...

766
00:43:52,088 --> 00:43:53,732
"Did I see it coming?
Could I have stopped it?"

767
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:55,049
You know how it is.

768
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:56,610
I saw it in him
when he was 5 years old.

769
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,302
People, they don't
want to feel fooled.

770
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,930
You know, there's,
"oh, I knew he had it in him

771
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:02,616
when he wouldn't open the door
for me one time,"

772
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,892
- that sort of thing.
- Yeah, you kicked a cat.

773
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:06,978
Yeah, I kicked a cat,
and one time,

774
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:09,480
ijumped up out from behind
the bushes to scare Ann.

775
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:10,731
Well, who hasn't done that?

776
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:13,025
And one time, it was that I...

777
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,610
I-I walked along
the railroad tracks

778
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,296
to see how long I could go
without falling off.

779
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,738
I mean, come on.

780
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,657
It's ridiculous.
Give me a break.

781
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:23,619
Jumping out from the bushes
was never my thing anyway.

782
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:27,582
There are a lot of myths
and misunderstandings about me.

783
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:29,876
Like you're a...
A master of disguise.

784
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:32,795
Oh, rny(Bod. Yes, yes.

785
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:35,506
Just half a dozen photographs
of my many faces.

786
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:37,717
But they were all taken
within a 10-year period.

787
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:40,136
They had
my graduation photo from '65

788
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:42,138
and my arrest photo from '75.

789
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:46,267
If you grow a beard, say,
just innocently grow a beard

790
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:49,228
or you come in...

791
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:51,814
In a different mood,
wearing a different expression,

792
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:54,567
people are gonna think you look
like a different person.

793
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:59,155
But this is the myth
that they wanted to tell,

794
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:01,240
the master of disguise.

795
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:02,658
But when you were caught,

796
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,952
you had to tell the police
who you were,

797
00:45:04,994 --> 00:45:07,038
even though you were
on the FBI's top-10 list.

798
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,790
I told them.
They didn't believe me.

799
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,128
When you were a fugitive,
did that list have

800
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:15,546
any bearing
on the way he behaved,

801
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:18,257
myrnannerofsurwval yeah, yeah.

802
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:20,801
But to be honest...
And I don't mean

803
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:22,637
to insult your intelligence
or anything...

804
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:25,139
But I don't think
you all catch anybody.

805
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:26,641
Not really.

806
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:30,728
I mean, there are exceptions,
certainly, but...

807
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:34,106
I think most guys get
themselves caught.

808
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:36,609
Well, do you think sometimes

809
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:38,277
they want to get caught?

810
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,154
I never wanted to be caught.

811
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:41,739
I know that's a top-tier theory,

812
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:44,492
but it's more
pop psychology crap.

813
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:47,370
No, the truth is, is that
nobody looks at those things.

814
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:49,872
Nobody keeps their eyes
peeled all daylong,

815
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:52,875
looking for somebody that they
saw on a "most wanted" picture.

816
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:55,086
Even cops, they walk around.

817
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:57,606
They don't believe that they're
ever gonna run into that person.

818
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,465
So all you have to do is

819
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:02,009
go about your day,
don't act weird,

820
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:05,805
and everyone thinks
you're just a regular guy.

821
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:07,390
I imagine that's
how serial killers

822
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,517
get their victims, as well.

823
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:14,021
I imagine it is, too.

824
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:19,694
You know,
we should write a book.

825
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,779
You just said...

826
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:23,447
No, no, no, not about me.

827
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:26,158
About profiling.

828
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,494
We could call it
"the bill and Ted show,"

829
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:30,913
I'm not writing a book.
Not with you.

830
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:32,790
- Not with anybody.
- Why not?

831
00:46:32,832 --> 00:46:35,102
Well, then I'd just be like all
the other prima Donnas, right?

832
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:36,979
Yeah, but think about what
it could do for your career.

833
00:46:37,003 --> 00:46:38,671
My career's fine.

834
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:46,470
You know,
if things were different,

835
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:49,598
I could be sitting
in that chair.

836
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,933
I could do what you do.

837
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:52,893
I have no doubt about that.

838
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:55,187
And if things were different,

839
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,981
you could be out there...

840
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:59,900
Trolling the streets,

841
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,819
looking for the right girl.

842
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:07,158
And getting to know her habits,

843
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:10,911
how she does her hair.

844
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:14,874
Which shoulder
she slings her purse over.

845
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:18,836
Does she bite her nails?

846
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:20,921
You could be that guy.

847
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:26,177
If things were different.

848
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:34,518
If things were different.

849
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,178
Jennings:
The U.S. supreme court today

850
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:35,913
said no to mass murder
Theodore Bundy.

851
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:37,998
The court refused to set aside
Bundy's conviction

852
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,792
and his death sentence
for the murder

853
00:48:39,834 --> 00:48:43,087
of a 12-year-old Florida girl
more than a decade ago.

854
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:48,509
Boss man wants to see you.

855
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:55,015
Come on in. Close the door.

856
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:00,688
Hagmaier: What is it?

857
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:02,898
Governor Martinez signed
a death warrant.

858
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,483
How long does he have?

859
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:07,403
- 60 days?
- Depue: 7 days.

860
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:10,531
Seven days.

861
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:12,158
Can he do that?

862
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:15,494
Ifsirregularas heh,
butyeah, “%legal

863
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:18,414
he's ready to talk.

864
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:20,708
- He wants the deal?
- Depue: Yes.

865
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:22,185
Said he's ready
to confess to everything,

866
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:24,879
but he'll only talk
to one person.

867
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:28,215
Well, it's about time.

868
00:49:28,257 --> 00:49:31,135
Depue: You hold his hand,
you tell him who to talk to,

869
00:49:31,177 --> 00:49:32,720
go in the room, be in there,

870
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:35,347
make sure he talks
instead of playing his games.

871
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:39,101
We've got seven days to close
god knows how many cases

872
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:42,021
and put these girls
and their families to rest.

873
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,689
Yeah, yeah.

874
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:46,609
That I can do.

875
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:51,030
Bush: We meet
on democracy's front porch,

876
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:54,575
a good place to talk
as neighbors and as friends.

877
00:49:54,617 --> 00:49:58,287
For this is a day when
our nation is made whole,

878
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:01,415
when our differences,
for a moment, are suspended.

879
00:50:01,457 --> 00:50:06,629
And my first act as president
is a prayer.

880
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,506
I ask you to bow your heads:

881
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:11,425
Heavenly father,
we bow our heads

882
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:13,928
and thank you for your love.

883
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:17,681
Accept our thanks for the peace
that yields this day

884
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:22,144
and the shared faith that
makes its continuance likely.

885
00:50:22,186 --> 00:50:24,396
Make us strong to do your work,

886
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:27,149
willing to heed
and hear your will...

887
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:38,410
Thank you.

888
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:42,164
Well, look, we ran away
from the FBI to join the circus.

889
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:43,499
It's a madhouse here.

890
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:45,125
We got phones ringing
off the hook.

891
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:47,103
I got inspectors coming
from all over the country,

892
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:49,171
got media camping out
across the street.

893
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:51,257
Now you're showing up
to join team Bundy.

894
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:52,716
No, I'm just here to coordinate.

895
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:54,593
Yeah, Carolyn's not
gonna see it that way.

896
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:57,054
- Who?
- Oh, she's the ringmaster

897
00:50:57,096 --> 00:50:58,514
of barnum, Bailey, and Bundy.

898
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:00,599
His civil attorney.

899
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:02,101
What does a civil attorney
have to do

900
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:04,395
- with coordinating interviews?
- I don't know.

901
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:06,272
You figure that out,
let me know.

902
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:09,233
Oh, and also find out why
a civil attorney has to visit

903
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:11,819
their client 80 times
in three years.

904
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:22,430
Lieberman: Okay.
We need all signed petitions.

905
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:23,890
All signed letters.
That Tanner letter.

906
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:26,166
- Let's find it.
- Hello.

907
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:28,252
You be special agent hagmaier.

908
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:29,503
Hagmaier: Mm-hmm. Bill.

909
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:31,213
Mr. Bundy says good things.

910
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:33,215
Not exactly sure
how to take that.

911
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:35,926
- As a compliment.
- Man: Excuse me.

912
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:37,678
We're still putting together
the schedule.

913
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,990
It was my understanding that
I was in charge of the schedule.

914
00:51:40,014 --> 00:51:41,640
Then you were misinformed.

915
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:43,851
The governor's not gonna stand
for any more games.

916
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:45,662
Lieberman: The governor
is the one playing games.

917
00:51:45,686 --> 00:51:48,147
He could've signed the death
warrant for 60 days, hell, 30.

918
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:49,565
He signed it for 7.

919
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:51,650
He's thinking more
about his own reelection

920
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:53,319
than he is about
doing what's right,

921
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,213
and if he wants to play
politics, then so can we.

922
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:56,488
This isn't the time to take

923
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:58,073
a stand
against the death penalty.

924
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,718
This is exactly the time
to take a stand against it.

925
00:51:59,742 --> 00:52:01,094
There are people desperate
to find out

926
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:02,536
what happened
to their daughters.

927
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:05,456
- And we need to...
- Bundy: Bill.

928
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:07,958
It's good to see you again.

929
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,252
I wish it were under
different circumstances.

930
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:12,338
Bundy: You and me both.

931
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:14,441
Lieberman: Mr. Bundy, I was just
telling Mr. Hagmaier that...

932
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:17,384
He will be in charge
of conducting interviews.

933
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:23,182
I don't think that's wise.

934
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:25,267
Well, bill knows most
of the guys here.

935
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:27,561
The ones he doesn't
know him by reputation.

936
00:52:27,603 --> 00:52:30,689
There's no one here
they'll trust more than him.

937
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:31,940
Okay. If that's what you want.

938
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,234
- It is.
- Okay.

939
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:35,920
Mr. Hagmaier, you can
be excused, and we'll...

940
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:38,822
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

941
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:40,491
We still need to brief
the investigators.

942
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:42,451
Bundy: Not without bill here.

943
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:45,162
I would like to remind you
that he's law enforcement.

944
00:52:45,204 --> 00:52:46,830
Bundy: Right.

945
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:49,124
Right. Look. Lieberman: Yeah.

946
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:53,128
I need a moment with bill.

947
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:57,192
I am not gonna leave you
alone with law enfor...

948
00:52:57,216 --> 00:52:59,259
Carolyn.

949
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:01,762
- Mm-hmm.
- Bundy: I told you.

950
00:53:01,804 --> 00:53:04,890
This is different.

951
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:06,392
This is bill.

952
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:10,562
He's my best friend.

953
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:15,567
Okay.

954
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:21,782
You know, we're gonna clear out
the room and let them...

955
00:53:21,824 --> 00:53:23,701
Let them have it.

956
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:38,340
Bundy: Bill, we both knew
this day would come.

957
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:42,136
I'm absolutely certain that you
knew more about my activities

958
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:44,847
and thought processes
than I was comfortable with,

959
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:47,099
more than you ever let on.

960
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:49,393
How long have you known?

961
00:53:49,435 --> 00:53:51,979
Since the moment
you walked in here.

962
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,064
Why didn't you
ever say anything?

963
00:53:54,106 --> 00:53:55,733
I didn't have to.

964
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,609
How long have you known
that I knew.

965
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:59,003
Since the first moment
you walked in here.

966
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:00,446
Then why didn't you
say anything?

967
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:02,322
Same reason.

968
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:05,451
All this... is it just theater?

969
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:07,137
Or are you really gonna
go through with it?

970
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:09,830
- Can't it be both?
- No, it can't.

971
00:54:09,872 --> 00:54:12,499
The Florida supreme court came
back with their ruling tonight,

972
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:16,396
I mean, I have one more appeal
with the U.S. supreme court,

973
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,881
but they really mean to kill me.

974
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,966
They really want to kill me.

975
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:22,843
You think this is funny?

976
00:54:22,885 --> 00:54:24,928
You've been sitting here
for eight years.

977
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,614
What do you think
they brought you here for?

978
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:28,474
It's just now starting
to sink in?

979
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:31,268
Bu n dy: Y-yeah. I knew it.

980
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:34,605
I knew I knew it,
but I just now thought about it.

981
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:36,315
They're going to kill me.

982
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:37,792
They're going to kill
my mother's son.

983
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:40,360
Maybe they will.
Maybe they won't.

984
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:42,863
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

985
00:54:42,905 --> 00:54:45,157
Let the bastards try, huh?

986
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:49,953
Look, you've got to do this.
You've got to come clean.

987
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:52,080
I will. I'm gonna do what
I can in a major way.

988
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,184
I'm gonna give them the truth,
but in a measured manner.

989
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:56,126
You can't hold
these girls hostage.

990
00:54:56,168 --> 00:54:58,128
Not anymore.
That tactic will backfire.

991
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:01,173
If anyone senses that you're
stalling on this, you're cooked.

992
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:02,633
Oh, no, you're right.

993
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:04,718
It's time to come clean.

994
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,804
But we still have a couple
of cards up our sleeve.

995
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:08,514
- Like what?
- You'll see.

996
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:10,325
You just focus on making sure
the investigators bring

997
00:55:10,349 --> 00:55:13,435
the right material
and stay on track.

998
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:15,938
What's the plan?

999
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:18,232
There are investigators
coming in from Utah,

1000
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:20,317
Colorado, Florida, Idaho,

1001
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:21,985
Idaho? Why Idaho?

1002
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:23,821
I've got a couple surprises
for them.

1003
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:26,323
I told you, you can't play games
with the governor of Florida.

1004
00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:28,450
You're not in any position
to extend your life

1005
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:30,536
by giving them some
Henry Lee Lucas kind of stuff.

1006
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:32,538
- What are you talking about?
- Why Idaho?

1007
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:34,623
Don't worry, Billy.
I got us covered.

1008
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:37,334
- I dropped two in Idaho.
- "Billy, I got us covered"?

1009
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:40,045
Why would I be happy that you
killed two girls in Idaho?

1010
00:55:40,087 --> 00:55:42,130
No, you're right. You're right.

1011
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:44,424
But Florida isn't gonna
do anything for me.

1012
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:47,970
Colorado, Washington, Oregon,
Utah can't do anything for me.

1013
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,263
But Idaho...

1014
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:50,722
They're gonna ask for more time.

1015
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,404
Bundy: And they can
petition the governor.

1016
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:54,272
- Ted, you cannot...
- Bundy: I'm not stalling.

1017
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:55,726
I'm not playing games.

1018
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:57,372
I'm coming clean.
And if that means bringing

1019
00:55:57,396 --> 00:55:58,957
other states into the mix,
then so be it.

1020
00:55:58,981 --> 00:56:00,440
- How many?
- Five.

1021
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:02,109
Not how many states.
How many girls?

1022
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:04,611
- Am I talking about?
- How many did you kill?

1023
00:56:04,653 --> 00:56:05,571
Thal

1024
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:08,073
hagmaier: Yes, that.

1025
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:09,575
Let's say 30.

1026
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:11,243
Let's say we talk
about the real number.

1027
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:12,911
30 is a nice round number.

1028
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:14,580
How many?

1029
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:16,248
I don't know.

1030
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:17,958
What do you mean you don't know?

1031
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,336
I didn't keep score,
and it gets confusing.

1032
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:23,505
I don't understand
what gets so confusing.

1033
00:56:23,547 --> 00:56:25,966
I'm not even sure
all of them are dead.

1034
00:56:26,008 --> 00:56:27,634
Bundy: There are several girls,

1035
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:30,804
girls that I hit over the head
and put in my car.

1036
00:56:30,846 --> 00:56:32,323
When I would drag them
out to the woods.

1037
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:35,142
They would wake up,
sometimes in my arms.

1038
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:37,728
Sometimes when I went back
to my car to get my tools.

1039
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:39,313
They all took off
into the woods,

1040
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:41,607
and I couldn't find them.

1041
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:42,941
I'd go home.

1042
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:45,861
I'd watch the news,
but not a peep.

1043
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:47,654
No news.

1044
00:56:47,696 --> 00:56:49,823
So did they run home
and change their name,

1045
00:56:49,865 --> 00:56:51,408
never to tell anyone
what happened,

1046
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:53,702
afraid that I would
come back and try again?

1047
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:55,787
Or did they die in those woods?
I don't know.

1048
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:59,541
So, it could be more than 30?

1049
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:01,418
Then there are the dry runs.

1050
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,878
Dry runs.

1051
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,560
Bundy: There are a lot
of girls I stalked,

1052
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:07,466
learned everything about,
staked out my spot,

1053
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:10,177
walked up to their door,
passed them on the street,

1054
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:11,637
and just walked away.

1055
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:13,263
Why?

1056
00:57:13,305 --> 00:57:15,682
Bundy: Because every time
I did this, I asked myself,

1057
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:17,351
am I going to kill this girl?

1058
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:19,937
Sometimes I said no,
and I never went back for her.

1059
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:21,605
I didn't understand.

1060
00:57:21,647 --> 00:57:23,499
Because the minute I say no
and couldn't walk away,

1061
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:26,401
it was the minute I was
on the road to being caught.

1062
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:29,738
Diane leach.

1063
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:33,283
I couldn't say no.

1064
00:57:33,325 --> 00:57:35,369
She was a mistake.

1065
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,245
I should never have killed
a 12-year-old girl.

1066
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,705
- She was a mistake?
- Yes.

1067
00:57:38,747 --> 00:57:41,625
- And the others?
- Choices.

1068
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:44,127
Can't really call those
mistakes, can I?

1069
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:45,837
So 30.

1070
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:50,425
I can for sure admit to 30.

1071
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:55,681
Why am I here, really?

1072
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:59,643
Bill, we've spent a good deal
of time together.

1073
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:01,979
Not as much as some
of the others.

1074
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:05,565
Yes, but you knew all along,

1075
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:07,567
and you treated me
like a human being.

1076
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:09,653
You just wanted to understand.

1077
00:58:09,695 --> 00:58:11,738
I still do.

1078
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:15,075
That's why you're here.

1079
00:58:15,117 --> 00:58:16,994
Each of the investigators
get two hours.

1080
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:19,496
I have a handful
of other interviews.

1081
00:58:19,538 --> 00:58:21,581
And then
when everything is clear,

1082
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:23,917
you and I will sit down
and have the conversation

1083
00:58:23,959 --> 00:58:26,420
you've wanted this whole time.

1084
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:28,922
What are you going to tell me?

1085
00:58:28,964 --> 00:58:31,049
Everything.

1086
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:43,228
What's this... gizmo?

1087
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:45,647
This will pick up everything
you're saying

1088
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:48,859
and everything that we're saying
over here on the other side.

1089
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,194
Bundy: Well, let's just
get it out in the open now.

1090
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:54,156
Mike, I know you have
some intense feelings about me.

1091
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:56,241
- No.
- Well, you may or you may not,

1092
00:58:56,283 --> 00:58:57,719
but if you think
I'm bullshitting you,

1093
00:58:57,743 --> 00:58:58,952
you tell me.

1094
00:58:58,994 --> 00:59:00,704
If I thought you
were just gonna...

1095
00:59:00,746 --> 00:59:03,081
Jack it around all day,
I wouldn't be here.

1096
00:59:03,123 --> 00:59:05,167
All right.

1097
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,710
I've been sent here
to talk to you

1098
00:59:06,752 --> 00:59:08,086
about grand junction.

1099
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:09,921
Where?

1100
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:12,215
And vale.

1101
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:15,969
Let's start with
bountiful, Utah.

1102
00:59:16,011 --> 00:59:17,637
I really need a map for that.

1103
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:19,473
Eugene, Oregon.

1104
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:23,852
And then we'll move on
to west linn and in corvallis.

1105
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:28,857
So, where exactly, Mr. Bundy,
did you take these girls from?

1106
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:30,460
- Excuse me?
- Woman: Well, there are a number

1107
00:59:30,484 --> 00:59:33,195
of unsolved disappearances
in the state of Idaho.

1108
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,113
Frankly, sir, we have no idea

1109
00:59:35,155 --> 00:59:36,573
which victims are yours.

1110
00:59:36,615 --> 00:59:38,575
Is there any need
as far as the western slope

1111
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:39,951
of Colorado is concerned,

1112
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:43,288
for us to go back before 1975,

1113
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:46,083
maybe even as far back as '68?

1114
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:51,129
I didn't get to Colorado
until '75.

1115
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:52,798
I really need a map for that.

1116
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:54,883
I mean, didn't your
office tell you.

1117
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:57,344
Yes, we're trying to get maps
down here as soon as possible.

1118
00:59:57,385 --> 00:59:58,654
The clock is ticking here, so...

1119
00:59:58,678 --> 00:59:59,822
Man: If you want
to describe the area,

1120
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:01,139
I know it pretty well.

1121
01:00:01,181 --> 01:00:02,599
Bundy: I could try.

1122
01:00:02,641 --> 01:00:04,893
Well, that was a long time ago.

1123
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:06,144
I mean, that was...

1124
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:11,358
There were... a lot...

1125
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:13,527
There were a lot of girls
since then.

1126
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:15,904
Did you clean the car
afte rwa rd s.

1127
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:17,155
I don't remember.

1128
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:19,116
If you were driving
60 miles an hour

1129
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:21,034
traveling south for...

1130
01:00:23,912 --> 01:00:25,765
Didn't think there'd be math
on this test, did you?

1131
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:28,458
- No, I did not.
- No, no, me neither.

1132
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,586
You said that was north
of pocatello, yeah?

1133
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:33,064
- I don't know its name.
- Woman: Okay.

1134
01:00:33,088 --> 01:00:34,673
But you drowned her there.

1135
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:36,758
No, I drowned her
in my hotel room.

1136
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,760
I only dumped her body
in the river.

1137
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:41,263
And then what did you do...

1138
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:43,974
After you killed her?

1139
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:46,101
I'm trying to work
with you here.

1140
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:47,185
Bundy: I know.

1141
01:00:47,227 --> 01:00:48,645
Look...

1142
01:00:48,687 --> 01:00:51,398
I think we're getting
close to lunch.

1143
01:00:53,233 --> 01:00:55,068
Alright. Let's break for lunch.

1144
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:56,820
We'll resume this after.

1145
01:01:01,032 --> 01:01:02,450
You're stalling.

1146
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:05,036
No, I'm lying.
There's a difference.

1147
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:07,372
What happened to giving up
everything in a major way?

1148
01:01:07,414 --> 01:01:09,040
- Bundy: You didn't see it.
- See what?

1149
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:13,003
- He knew her.
- What? Bull.

1150
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:14,713
- How could you tell?
- I don't know.

1151
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:17,215
I don't know. Something
in the way he talked about it.

1152
01:01:17,257 --> 01:01:18,925
I don't know.
It was in his eyes.

1153
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:20,820
I don't know if they were dating
or romantic or whatever,

1154
01:01:20,844 --> 01:01:22,679
but he had a relationship
with that girl.

1155
01:01:22,721 --> 01:01:24,306
Well, I didn't see it.

1156
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:26,033
Bundy: That's because you
weren't sitting across from him.

1157
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:27,451
- You would've if you were.
- So, you didn't tell him...

1158
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:28,977
Because I didn't want
to tell that guy

1159
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:30,371
that I made love
to his dead girlfriend

1160
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:33,648
right before I cut her head
clean off.

1161
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,568
Jesus.

1162
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:42,199
I'm going to lunch.

1163
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:01,259
Okay. Let's go back
to grand junction.

1164
01:02:01,301 --> 01:02:03,053
May I ask you something,
just briefly.

1165
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:06,014
- Certainly.
- Did you know her?

1166
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:11,937
Yes, I did.

1167
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:15,065
I had a feeling.
Icouldjust, uh...

1168
01:02:15,106 --> 01:02:16,858
Sense the emotion.

1169
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,151
Man: Yeah. Well...

1170
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:21,988
It's an emotional thing.

1171
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:23,573
Sure, I know that.

1172
01:02:23,615 --> 01:02:25,343
Man: I would appreciate it
if you didn't let that

1173
01:02:25,367 --> 01:02:27,160
color our conversation here.

1174
01:02:27,202 --> 01:02:28,620
I think we should
move on to vale.

1175
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:30,497
I still have a few more
questions about...

1176
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:31,790
Vale.

1177
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:32,791
Hagmaier: You drive back safe.

1178
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:34,292
Yeah.

1179
01:02:52,352 --> 01:02:54,938
So, about tomorrow.

1180
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:57,565
- You mean the dobson thing.
- What dobson thing?

1181
01:02:57,607 --> 01:03:02,153
Some radio preacher,
televangelist.

1182
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:03,488
Carolyn set it up.

1183
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:04,823
We said no media

1184
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:08,159
we'll you'll have
to talk to Carolyn.

1185
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:13,373
Okay. Can you do me a favor?
Put your father on.

1186
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,377
Yeah, no, it's...

1187
01:03:17,419 --> 01:03:20,505
No easier today, no.

1188
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:24,259
Oh, yeah. Comes with
the territory, right?

1189
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:29,055
Yeah, no, I'm leaving now.

1190
01:03:29,097 --> 01:03:32,183
Mm-hmm. I should, uh...

1191
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:34,394
I should go.

1192
01:03:34,436 --> 01:03:37,689
Okay. Yes. I will see you soon.

1193
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:39,774
Yeah. Okay.

1194
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:41,651
Okay, yeah.

1195
01:03:41,693 --> 01:03:43,528
Yes, got to go. Okay. Bye.

1196
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:45,613
What's the schedule tomorrow?

1197
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:48,033
- You have a very light day.
- I mean dobson.

1198
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:49,701
You won't be needed for that.

1199
01:03:49,743 --> 01:03:51,512
All of the interviews
are supposed to go through me.

1200
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:53,139
All the law enforcement
interviews were to be

1201
01:03:53,163 --> 01:03:54,598
scheduled through you,
and they were.

1202
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:56,058
What the heck are you trying
to pull here?

1203
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:57,393
I'm just trying
to give my client a chance

1204
01:03:57,417 --> 01:03:59,419
to tell his side of the story.

1205
01:03:59,461 --> 01:04:01,105
Do you think dobson will
petition the government for...

1206
01:04:01,129 --> 01:04:03,715
Dr. Dobson
is a very well connected man.

1207
01:04:03,757 --> 01:04:05,675
- We said no media.
- And he knows the rules.

1208
01:04:05,717 --> 01:04:07,010
He just wants to talk to him.

1209
01:04:07,052 --> 01:04:08,636
Ted will tell him what
he wants to hear.

1210
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:11,264
- He wants a poster boy.
- And we'll give it to him.

1211
01:04:17,771 --> 01:04:20,857
Dr. Dobson, this is
special agent bill hagmaier.

1212
01:04:20,899 --> 01:04:22,484
- Special agent.
- Doctor.

1213
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:24,378
It's good to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

1214
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:26,363
You're doing
the lord's work here.

1215
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:28,031
We've done what we can.

1216
01:04:28,073 --> 01:04:29,300
But we still have
a lot of investigators

1217
01:04:29,324 --> 01:04:31,576
left to squeeze in.

1218
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:34,287
Well, your two hours
are counting down.

1219
01:04:34,329 --> 01:04:35,789
I won't keep you.

1220
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:42,003
Carolyn, I'm going
to check on our setup.

1221
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:44,714
- Carolyn: Mm-hmm.
- Get me something to drink.

1222
01:04:44,756 --> 01:04:46,383
That was rude.

1223
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:48,486
How long of an interview
can he get with all the setup?

1224
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:49,761
The setup doesn't count.

1225
01:04:49,803 --> 01:04:51,596
What do you mean
it doesn't count?

1226
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:53,056
This is a real production.

1227
01:04:53,098 --> 01:04:54,766
You don't just
point a camera and shoot.

1228
01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:57,685
How long?

1229
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:58,937
We have seven hours blocked.

1230
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:01,272
- Seven hours?!
- Correct.

1231
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,026
He's guilty.

1232
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:09,406
This won't help anyone.

1233
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:11,116
Excuse me.

1234
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:21,501
Dobson: You are guilty of
killing many women and girls.

1235
01:05:21,543 --> 01:05:24,629
Is that correct?

1236
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:26,297
Bundy: Yes.

1237
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:28,216
Yes, that's true.

1238
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,430
Dobson: Ted, how did it happen?

1239
01:05:33,471 --> 01:05:34,639
Take me back.

1240
01:05:34,681 --> 01:05:37,642
So much grief, so much sorrow,

1241
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:40,979
so much pain for so many people.

1242
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:42,230
Where did it start?

1243
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:45,108
How did this moment come about?

1244
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:48,319
Bundy: That's part
of the tragedy

1245
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:50,447
of this whole situation,

1246
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:53,783
because I grew up
in a wonderful home

1247
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:57,537
with two dedicated
and loving parents.

1248
01:05:57,579 --> 01:06:01,916
I'm one of five
brothers and sisters.

1249
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:05,795
But as a boy,

1250
01:06:05,837 --> 01:06:08,089
and I...

1251
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:13,511
And I mean 12, 13...

1252
01:06:13,553 --> 01:06:15,722
I encountered,

1253
01:06:15,763 --> 01:06:17,557
outside of the home again,

1254
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:21,102
in the local grocery stores,

1255
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:23,396
the local drugstores,

1256
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:26,941
soft core pornography.

1257
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:28,401
Soft core,

1258
01:06:28,443 --> 01:06:31,529
what people call soft core.

1259
01:06:31,571 --> 01:06:35,700
And as I think I explained
to you last night, Dr. Dobson,

1260
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:39,078
an anecdote, as boys do,

1261
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:44,292
we would explore
the back roads and sideways

1262
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:46,794
and byways of our neighborhood.

1263
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:51,090
And often times,
people would dump the garbage

1264
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:54,219
or whatever they were clearing
out of their house.

1265
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:57,138
From time to time,
we'd come across

1266
01:06:57,180 --> 01:06:59,641
old pornographic books

1267
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:02,560
of a harder, more explicit,

1268
01:07:02,602 --> 01:07:04,229
graphic nature

1269
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:05,897
than what we'd encounter

1270
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:09,025
in, say,
your local grocery store.

1271
01:07:09,067 --> 01:07:10,902
And this included such things

1272
01:07:10,944 --> 01:07:13,196
as detective magazines.

1273
01:07:13,238 --> 01:07:15,406
Those involved violence.

1274
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:19,160
Yes, this is something
I want to emphasize,

1275
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:20,703
is the... the...

1276
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:24,457
The most damaging kinds
of pornography in...

1277
01:07:24,499 --> 01:07:28,419
And again, I'm talking
from personal experience here,

1278
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:32,924
hard real personal experience,

1279
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:37,095
are those that involve violence,
sexual violence,

1280
01:07:37,136 --> 01:07:40,723
because of the wedding
of those two forces,

1281
01:07:40,765 --> 01:07:44,894
I only know too well,

1282
01:07:44,936 --> 01:07:49,315
brings out a behavior
that is just...

1283
01:07:49,357 --> 01:07:53,486
Too terrible to describe.

1284
01:07:53,528 --> 01:07:56,406
We are your sons,
and we are your husbands,

1285
01:07:56,447 --> 01:07:59,534
and we grew up
in regular families.

1286
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:02,954
And pornography can reach out

1287
01:08:02,996 --> 01:08:06,082
and snatch a kid out
of any house.

1288
01:08:06,124 --> 01:08:08,376
It snatched me out of my home

1289
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:10,461
20, 30 years ago.

1290
01:08:16,968 --> 01:08:19,429
As good a Christian home...

1291
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:45,246
Were you happy
with the interview.

1292
01:08:45,288 --> 01:08:46,873
Very.

1293
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:50,001
His message is going
to go out to the world

1294
01:08:50,043 --> 01:08:53,338
and save untold thousands
of lives and souls.

1295
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:56,257
- And the governor?
- Is going to love this.

1296
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:58,384
So, you'll talk to him.

1297
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:05,767
The governor was never
going to pardon him.

1298
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:08,519
He's a murderer.

1299
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:10,813
But now he can go on
to meet the lord

1300
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:14,567
with a clean soul
and an unburdened heart.

1301
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:17,695
Thank you for this
tremendous experience.

1302
01:09:17,737 --> 01:09:19,697
This is going to change lives.

1303
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:22,617
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go across the street.

1304
01:09:22,659 --> 01:09:24,303
Hagemaier: No, we had
an agreement. No press!

1305
01:09:24,327 --> 01:09:25,411
This is too big.

1306
01:09:25,453 --> 01:09:26,829
The world needs to know why

1307
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:28,498
he killed those girls.

1308
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:30,375
It was a pleasure meeting you,
bill.

1309
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:31,834
Lieberman: Yeah, hi. It's me.

1310
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:34,754
I need everyone down here asap.

1311
01:10:02,115 --> 01:10:04,992
Woman: Today in Florida,
a notorious serial killer is

1312
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:08,121
sustaining a string of very
last-minute confessions.

1313
01:10:08,162 --> 01:10:11,666
Ted Bundy is trying
to stay his execution,

1314
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:14,585
which is scheduled for tomorrow
in the electric chair.

1315
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:16,546
Ted Bundy has now confessed
to at least some

1316
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:18,631
of the violent murders
he's suspected of,

1317
01:10:18,673 --> 01:10:21,551
bringing some measure of relief
to the victims families.

1318
01:10:21,592 --> 01:10:23,428
Jennifer strother
was a co-worker

1319
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:26,347
of Julie Cunningham,
a vale ski shop employee

1320
01:10:26,389 --> 01:10:28,015
Bundy has confessed to killing.

1321
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:44,699
Bill. Word?

1322
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:50,955
Bundy's people are calling
for a sanity hearing.

1323
01:10:50,997 --> 01:10:54,292
Well, that's straight
out of the playbook.

1324
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:55,960
Governor will send down
his people,

1325
01:10:56,002 --> 01:10:57,420
who will find him sane,

1326
01:10:57,462 --> 01:10:59,505
as the governor
has instructed them to do.

1327
01:10:59,547 --> 01:11:01,883
And then, of course,
Carolyn will call in her team

1328
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:03,551
of heavy hitters, who will...

1329
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:05,636
They'll find him nuts,
whether he is or not.

1330
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:07,513
Whether he is or not.

1331
01:11:07,555 --> 01:11:09,140
So, it will come down

1332
01:11:09,182 --> 01:11:11,851
to any interviewing
law enforcement officials

1333
01:11:11,893 --> 01:11:15,021
who spent significant time
with him.

1334
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:23,988
You're saying I'm the guy
that's actually gonna decide

1335
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:26,073
whether or not
he gets the chair.

1336
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:30,286
Warden: It's a hell of a thing
to put on to a man, but yes.

1337
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:35,851
Man: That's who you want
to be president.

1338
01:11:35,875 --> 01:11:37,519
Former head of the CIA.
That's who you want.

1339
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:39,921
Some one who knows
what it's like on the ground.

1340
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:42,423
- Absolutely. Absolutely.
- You know?

1341
01:11:42,465 --> 01:11:45,092
- Get stuff done.
- Get it done. Get it done.

1342
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:47,404
Man: Hey, bill, you've met
assistant warden Decker, right?

1343
01:11:47,428 --> 01:11:50,932
Man #2: Yeah, I think we met at
the crime in america conference.

1344
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:52,475
I don't remember.

1345
01:11:52,517 --> 01:11:55,520
Man: Good evening, everyone.

1346
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:57,605
Ted Bundy has 13 hours to live,

1347
01:11:57,647 --> 01:12:01,234
and he is using those hours to
try to buy himself more time.

1348
01:12:01,275 --> 01:12:03,194
Shortly after 2:30
this afternoon,

1349
01:12:03,236 --> 01:12:06,030
a diesel engine that will
power tomorrow's execution

1350
01:12:06,072 --> 01:12:08,741
arrived at the Florida
state prison for testing,

1351
01:12:08,783 --> 01:12:11,661
showing the first signs
of what is to come.

1352
01:12:11,702 --> 01:12:15,957
Hagmaier: You said he wanted to
do something for the families.

1353
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:18,060
You don't exactly have a lot
of time left to do that.

1354
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:20,795
Bundy: We're still
waiting on the court.

1355
01:12:23,506 --> 01:12:25,216
Bundy t-shirts for sale.

1356
01:12:25,258 --> 01:12:27,510
This one says,
"burn, Bundy, burn."

1357
01:12:27,552 --> 01:12:29,470
And the vendor says
business is good.

1358
01:12:29,512 --> 01:12:31,973
I'm not making a lot
of money on this.

1359
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:33,432
But I'm getting the message out.

1360
01:12:44,235 --> 01:12:45,862
And they say I'm crazy.

1361
01:12:49,657 --> 01:12:52,952
The governor isn't gonna call.

1362
01:12:52,994 --> 01:12:55,454
This is it, right?

1363
01:12:55,496 --> 01:12:59,792
The governor has identified
three psychiatrists, good ones.

1364
01:12:59,834 --> 01:13:01,669
They're interviewing staff,
administrators,

1365
01:13:01,711 --> 01:13:03,880
anyone who's come
in contact with you

1366
01:13:03,921 --> 01:13:05,798
to ask
if they've noticed any change

1367
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,425
in your behavior
over the last week.

1368
01:13:07,466 --> 01:13:09,135
Well, that's alright.

1369
01:13:13,472 --> 01:13:15,725
They're gonna ask you.

1370
01:13:15,766 --> 01:13:17,202
I mean, who have you
spent more time with

1371
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:18,644
over the last three days?

1372
01:13:18,686 --> 01:13:21,355
And if you tell them
that I'm not crazy...

1373
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:23,649
I'll be executed.

1374
01:13:23,691 --> 01:13:26,569
That is the likeliest outcome.

1375
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:44,670
I need to make a phone call.

1376
01:13:44,712 --> 01:13:45,939
Hagmaier: Yeah, you have
all the calls...

1377
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:47,298
To my mother.

1378
01:13:49,759 --> 01:13:52,637
What the hell do I say to her,
bill?

1379
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:56,390
- I don't know how to...
- You tell the truth.

1380
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:59,560
You apologize.
You say you're sorry.

1381
01:14:03,064 --> 01:14:05,316
Write her a letter.

1382
01:14:05,358 --> 01:14:07,234
I don't know how
to write that, bill.

1383
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:24,001
Hagmaier: Alright.
Let's work this out.

1384
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:37,139
Here you go.

1385
01:14:37,181 --> 01:14:41,352
Well, you're asking me
to do something.

1386
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:45,731
Just start with, "dear mom."

1387
01:14:52,863 --> 01:14:54,532
Bundy: Dear...

1388
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:57,034
How long's it been
since you've talked to her?

1389
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:03,207
- Three years.
- We'll start with that.

1390
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:27,565
You only have a few hours left.

1391
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:32,236
What did you have in mind?

1392
01:15:35,156 --> 01:15:38,242
You told me once,
when you were ready,

1393
01:15:38,284 --> 01:15:41,370
you'd take me under the water.

1394
01:15:41,412 --> 01:15:44,081
I did.

1395
01:15:47,334 --> 01:15:49,128
Where are we going?

1396
01:15:52,673 --> 01:15:54,300
Bundy: I'm, uh...

1397
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:55,342
Pretty tired.

1398
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:56,802
I think I should get some rest

1399
01:15:56,844 --> 01:15:59,555
before the morning.

1400
01:15:59,597 --> 01:16:01,223
Ted...

1401
01:16:01,265 --> 01:16:03,517
You said you wanted to confess,

1402
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:04,977
tell the truth.

1403
01:16:05,019 --> 01:16:07,063
You can't get right with god,

1404
01:16:07,104 --> 01:16:09,982
holding all that in.

1405
01:16:10,024 --> 01:16:13,944
If you consider me a friend...

1406
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:01,575
I'm going to...

1407
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:04,703
Take you somewhere...

1408
01:17:04,745 --> 01:17:08,082
That I've never
taken anyone before.

1409
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:14,046
And I will do the talking.

1410
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:32,940
Beautiful.

1411
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:37,153
Radiant.

1412
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:41,407
And very familiar.

1413
01:17:43,576 --> 01:17:46,036
Her dad is sick.

1414
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:47,413
He's, uh...

1415
01:17:47,454 --> 01:17:49,498
He's in and out of the hospital.

1416
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:52,209
I hear her talking about it

1417
01:17:52,251 --> 01:17:55,462
over a pay phone.

1418
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:59,008
He has heart problems.

1419
01:17:59,049 --> 01:18:00,676
I have a badge

1420
01:18:00,718 --> 01:18:02,970
that I got in the usual way,

1421
01:18:03,012 --> 01:18:06,098
a local police badge.

1422
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:08,392
And tonight...

1423
01:18:08,434 --> 01:18:10,895
Full moon.

1424
01:18:10,936 --> 01:18:12,563
She looks amazing.

1425
01:18:12,605 --> 01:18:15,608
She's exactly like one
of the girls from the magazines.

1426
01:18:15,649 --> 01:18:17,693
- The detective magazines.
- Bundy: Spitting image.

1427
01:18:17,735 --> 01:18:19,570
Walk up to her.

1428
01:18:19,612 --> 01:18:21,655
I'm officer Ted,

1429
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:23,115
officer Ted Bundy.

1430
01:18:23,157 --> 01:18:24,408
Something's happened.

1431
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:26,285
She goes pale.
"What do you mean?"

1432
01:18:26,327 --> 01:18:27,870
"Your father's
had a heart attack.

1433
01:18:27,912 --> 01:18:30,664
I was sent to find you.
My car is over this way."

1434
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:33,000
She rushes with me.
It all happened so fast.

1435
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:35,377
She doesn't have time
to clock the police officer

1436
01:18:35,419 --> 01:18:37,338
is picking her up
in a Volkswagen.

1437
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:39,256
I open the door for her.

1438
01:18:39,298 --> 01:18:42,426
Before she realizes there's
no passenger seat, wham!

1439
01:18:42,468 --> 01:18:43,969
I hit her
in the back of the head

1440
01:18:44,011 --> 01:18:46,263
with a tire iron.

1441
01:18:46,305 --> 01:18:47,514
She's out.

1442
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:50,434
Isn't she beautiful?

1443
01:18:50,476 --> 01:18:52,937
Her dark hair parted
down the middle.

1444
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:55,856
Gorgeous.

1445
01:18:55,898 --> 01:18:58,651
I want her so bad.

1446
01:18:58,692 --> 01:19:00,361
But no.

1447
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:02,655
Not yet.

1448
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:05,991
Bundy: Stick to the plan.
Just a few more miles.

1449
01:19:06,033 --> 01:19:08,702
You can do whatever you want.

1450
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:12,039
The air is cold. It's crisp.

1451
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:13,666
Now we're there. We're there.

1452
01:19:13,707 --> 01:19:15,125
I drag her out of the car.

1453
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:16,585
I drag her through the woods

1454
01:19:16,627 --> 01:19:19,296
to the place I have
all picked out.

1455
01:19:19,338 --> 01:19:20,547
That spot.

1456
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:22,841
She's lying there
in the moonlight.

1457
01:19:22,883 --> 01:19:25,344
Her curves, her skin,
her blouse.

1458
01:19:25,386 --> 01:19:27,429
I can see her curves.

1459
01:19:30,933 --> 01:19:32,786
Don't get caught.
That's how you don't get caught.

1460
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:34,853
I need my kit. It's in the car.

1461
01:19:34,895 --> 01:19:38,190
Back of the wheel well.
Get rid of it after I'm done.

1462
01:19:38,232 --> 01:19:40,276
Never use the same kit twice.
That's you get caught.

1463
01:19:40,317 --> 01:19:41,860
You didn't let them
catch you with it.

1464
01:19:41,902 --> 01:19:43,779
You got to know
where to drop it.

1465
01:19:43,821 --> 01:19:46,323
And I undress her.

1466
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:51,537
I wrap the garrot
around her neck.

1467
01:19:51,578 --> 01:19:55,291
And I bend her over.

1468
01:19:55,332 --> 01:19:58,419
And I wake her with
the smelling salts.

1469
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:01,338
And she wakes, and she screams.

1470
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:03,841
Shhhhhh!

1471
01:20:03,882 --> 01:20:06,343
"Please, please, please,
don't do this."

1472
01:20:06,385 --> 01:20:08,637
Don't cry. Don't cry.

1473
01:20:08,679 --> 01:20:12,391
- Just be quiet.
- Please, don't do this.

1474
01:20:12,433 --> 01:20:16,145
I live out all the fantasies.

1475
01:20:16,186 --> 01:20:17,604
I fuck her until I...

1476
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:19,064
I've ever dreamed of.

1477
01:20:19,106 --> 01:20:20,316
It's just that moment.

1478
01:20:20,357 --> 01:20:22,818
I wrap the garrot tighter.

1479
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:23,944
I wring her neck.

1480
01:20:23,986 --> 01:20:25,529
I choke her. She's bucking.

1481
01:20:25,571 --> 01:20:28,032
She's gasping.

1482
01:20:29,116 --> 01:20:32,828
Oh!

1483
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:35,956
I feel her going limp.

1484
01:20:35,998 --> 01:20:38,876
And...

1485
01:20:38,917 --> 01:20:40,586
Iwrap her...

1486
01:20:40,627 --> 01:20:42,689
Hagmaier:
I wrap my arms around her.

1487
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:52,514
And I turn her around.

1488
01:20:56,310 --> 01:20:59,605
And I kiss her.

1489
01:20:59,646 --> 01:21:03,567
I swallow her last breath whole.

1490
01:21:07,154 --> 01:21:10,032
She knows.

1491
01:21:10,074 --> 01:21:12,326
She knows...

1492
01:21:12,368 --> 01:21:14,620
That it's her last moments
on earth.

1493
01:21:14,661 --> 01:21:16,914
- Bundy: And she's mine.
- This is it.

1494
01:21:16,955 --> 01:21:18,791
This is it.

1495
01:21:18,832 --> 01:21:20,876
She's mine.

1496
01:22:05,838 --> 01:22:08,090
We went out for food.

1497
01:22:08,132 --> 01:22:11,427
But nothing was open this late
but a gas station.

1498
01:22:11,468 --> 01:22:13,554
Thanks.

1499
01:22:18,559 --> 01:22:20,227
So, what'd he tell you?

1500
01:22:30,362 --> 01:22:31,697
Special agent.

1501
01:22:31,738 --> 01:22:33,574
Governor's team
is ready for you now.

1502
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:39,621
Woman: Alright.

1503
01:22:39,663 --> 01:22:43,000
I think we have
everything we need.

1504
01:22:46,086 --> 01:22:48,964
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1505
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:51,675
Thank you for your time,
agent hagmaier.

1506
01:23:05,731 --> 01:23:07,608
Lieberman: [ Sighs 1

1507
01:23:19,286 --> 01:23:21,121
Ifailed.

1508
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:26,793
No one could've saved him
after what he's done.

1509
01:23:29,713 --> 01:23:32,549
Carolyn...

1510
01:23:32,591 --> 01:23:34,843
You need to go home
to your husband,

1511
01:23:34,885 --> 01:23:38,013
go home to your kids,
get some sleep?

1512
01:23:40,474 --> 01:23:41,767
Has anyone ever told you

1513
01:23:41,808 --> 01:23:44,311
that you need to go home
to your kids?

1514
01:23:50,567 --> 01:23:54,488
I know what people say.

1515
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:57,616
The guards, everyone.

1516
01:23:58,617 --> 01:24:00,452
About Ted and I.

1517
01:24:00,494 --> 01:24:02,079
People say things.

1518
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:03,956
You want to know what
I think about Ted Bundy?

1519
01:24:03,997 --> 01:24:07,918
I will tell you. I hate him.

1520
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:13,549
I... I think I hate him more
than anybody I've ever hated.

1521
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:14,925
Then why defend him?

1522
01:24:14,967 --> 01:24:18,262
Because murder is murder,

1523
01:24:18,303 --> 01:24:21,181
and... in the end,

1524
01:24:21,223 --> 01:24:24,726
we all have to be accountable
for what we've done,

1525
01:24:24,768 --> 01:24:27,020
and that includes me
as much as it includes Ted,

1526
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:28,939
and it includes you, too,

1527
01:24:30,607 --> 01:24:32,025
whether you realize it or not,

1528
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:33,902
you just helped pull
the trigger in there.

1529
01:24:33,944 --> 01:24:35,988
It's between him and god now.

1530
01:24:36,029 --> 01:24:39,533
I just told the truth.

1531
01:24:39,575 --> 01:24:43,620
Him and god. Right.

1532
01:24:48,125 --> 01:24:50,419
God is what gets you
through this?

1533
01:24:54,339 --> 01:24:56,174
Goodbye, bill.

1534
01:25:04,516 --> 01:25:07,394
Man: "He maketh me to
lie down in green pastures.

1535
01:25:07,436 --> 01:25:10,314
He ieadeth me beside
the still waters.

1536
01:25:10,355 --> 01:25:12,608
He restoreth my soul.

1537
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:15,068
He ieadeth me in the paths
of righteousness

1538
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:16,737
for his name's sake.

1539
01:25:16,778 --> 01:25:18,322
Yea, though I walk

1540
01:25:18,363 --> 01:25:20,032
through the valley
of the shadow of death,

1541
01:25:20,073 --> 01:25:23,827
I will fear no evil:
For thou art with me;

1542
01:25:23,869 --> 01:25:25,704
thy rod and thy staff..."

1543
01:25:25,746 --> 01:25:30,917
Man #2: Look down and give
comfort to your son, Ted,

1544
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:33,629
as he prepares to make
his final...

1545
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:36,173
Oh, no! No!

1546
01:25:36,214 --> 01:25:38,050
Man: In a place where thine...

1547
01:25:38,091 --> 01:25:39,509
Man #2: The lord of hosts.

1548
01:25:39,551 --> 01:25:41,219
He is the king of glory.

1549
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:50,771
I can't fucking hear anything!

1550
01:25:55,817 --> 01:26:00,364
Man: I and praiseth me I

1551
01:26:03,533 --> 01:26:08,330
I my song shall be... I

1552
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:30,811
Bundy: I wanted
to say something.

1553
01:26:30,852 --> 01:26:33,647
You know, while I still can.

1554
01:26:37,609 --> 01:26:40,487
Thanks for being here,

1555
01:26:40,529 --> 01:26:42,614
for being a friend.

1556
01:26:45,117 --> 01:26:48,537
Everyone always wanted
something from me.

1557
01:26:48,578 --> 01:26:50,247
I was a noteworthy client,

1558
01:26:50,288 --> 01:26:54,626
or... or... or another brick
on their road to salvation

1559
01:26:54,668 --> 01:26:58,797
or a name on their cover
to sell a book, but...

1560
01:27:01,049 --> 01:27:03,510
But you...

1561
01:27:03,552 --> 01:27:07,472
All you ever wanted from me
was to understand.

1562
01:27:07,514 --> 01:27:10,392
And that's all a friend is.

1563
01:27:10,434 --> 01:27:14,563
You know, someone
who wants to understand.

1564
01:27:14,604 --> 01:27:16,773
All they want to believe
is that the worst person

1565
01:27:16,815 --> 01:27:18,692
in the world got smoked?

1566
01:27:23,071 --> 01:27:25,949
You know what? Screw that.

1567
01:27:25,991 --> 01:27:28,660
I'm not gonna give the state
the satisfaction of killing me.

1568
01:27:28,702 --> 01:27:31,788
They can Bury me if they want,
but they can't kill me.

1569
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:33,039
You see this pen?!

1570
01:27:33,081 --> 01:27:34,624
I can put this in my arm
right now.

1571
01:27:34,666 --> 01:27:36,752
I can bleed out before
anybody gets in here.

1572
01:27:36,793 --> 01:27:39,254
I've researched it.
I've seen other guys do it.

1573
01:27:39,296 --> 01:27:41,840
- I can do it.
- You don't think I trust you?

1574
01:27:41,882 --> 01:27:43,300
What, you want me
to grab that pen

1575
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:45,594
and stop you from
killing yourself right now?

1576
01:27:45,635 --> 01:27:47,679
I'm not gonna do it.

1577
01:27:47,721 --> 01:27:50,807
If that's your plan...

1578
01:27:50,849 --> 01:27:53,101
But you wanted to do some good
before you went.

1579
01:27:53,143 --> 01:27:54,370
Bundy: And I've done it.
I've done all I can.

1580
01:27:54,394 --> 01:27:57,063
- You said so yourself.
- Not all.

1581
01:27:57,105 --> 01:27:58,732
Those families,

1582
01:27:58,774 --> 01:28:02,152
they need to know that you
died for their daughter.

1583
01:28:02,194 --> 01:28:04,130
Each one of them independently
is going to believe

1584
01:28:04,154 --> 01:28:06,448
that you died
for their daughter.

1585
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:11,328
That's why you have
to die in the morning.

1586
01:28:11,369 --> 01:28:13,038
It's for them.

1587
01:28:19,419 --> 01:28:21,671
What's gonna happen to me?

1588
01:28:21,713 --> 01:28:23,590
Hagmaier: I don't know.

1589
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:48,198
I can't get what
I need from here.

1590
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:49,741
What do you mean?

1591
01:28:49,783 --> 01:28:51,409
I have been reading
this fucking thing.

1592
01:28:51,451 --> 01:28:53,537
I just don't know.
I don't know. I don't know.

1593
01:28:53,578 --> 01:28:57,123
Well, what we do know is you're
going to die in the morning,

1594
01:28:57,165 --> 01:28:59,376
and there will be
a final judgment.

1595
01:28:59,417 --> 01:29:02,087
How am I going
to explain all this to god?

1596
01:29:02,128 --> 01:29:05,215
There's a thing called remorse,

1597
01:29:05,257 --> 01:29:08,134
a thing called repentance.

1598
01:29:08,176 --> 01:29:11,680
Salvation has to come
from within first.

1599
01:29:11,721 --> 01:29:14,850
You're not gonna be able to lie
your way out of this one, Ted.

1600
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:20,230
Seven days!

1601
01:29:20,272 --> 01:29:22,524
That fucking governor...
He gave me seven days!

1602
01:29:22,566 --> 01:29:24,401
It could've been 30.
It could've been 60!

1603
01:29:24,442 --> 01:29:26,278
I could have had some time
to do some good.

1604
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:28,363
I could have had time
to figure out how to live.

1605
01:29:28,405 --> 01:29:29,614
But that selfish bastard,

1606
01:29:29,656 --> 01:29:31,491
he wanted to put
a notch on his desk.

1607
01:29:31,533 --> 01:29:35,036
"I'm the guy who fried him!"
That motherfucker!

1608
01:29:35,078 --> 01:29:37,747
They want to kill me
for their own satisfaction,

1609
01:29:37,789 --> 01:29:39,416
all so they can feel better,

1610
01:29:39,457 --> 01:29:41,918
but they are not better than me.

1611
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:45,463
They are not better than me!

1612
01:29:45,505 --> 01:29:48,174
Why, bill?!

1613
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:50,051
Why did this happen to me?

1614
01:29:50,093 --> 01:29:52,429
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

1615
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:54,514
You're asking me,
so I'm gonna tell you right now!

1616
01:29:54,556 --> 01:29:56,391
How many of your victims
had the opportunity

1617
01:29:56,433 --> 01:29:57,851
that you have, huh?!

1618
01:29:57,893 --> 01:30:01,187
To prepare for death,
to call your mom?

1619
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:04,107
You don't even know
how many girls there even were!

1620
01:30:04,149 --> 01:30:06,401
All those children!

1621
01:30:06,443 --> 01:30:08,153
All those children who died!

1622
01:30:08,194 --> 01:30:09,672
They weren't all children.
Most of them were women...

1623
01:30:09,696 --> 01:30:11,323
They were all somebody's child,
Ted!

1624
01:30:11,364 --> 01:30:13,199
- Yeah, yeah.
- You're somebody's child.

1625
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:15,327
Yeah.

1626
01:30:20,165 --> 01:30:22,000
You're pissed at me, aren't you?

1627
01:30:22,042 --> 01:30:23,460
Yeah.

1628
01:30:23,501 --> 01:30:24,878
Yes, I am.

1629
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:26,355
You think they should kill me,
don't you?

1630
01:30:26,379 --> 01:30:28,256
You think it's my turn to die.

1631
01:30:30,592 --> 01:30:33,720
Frankly, they probably should've
done it a long time ago.

1632
01:30:42,103 --> 01:30:44,189
I have to pray.

1633
01:30:51,529 --> 01:30:53,406
Officer: Mr. Hagmaier.

1634
01:30:57,243 --> 01:30:58,703
It's time.

1635
01:31:10,966 --> 01:31:13,426
Will I see you out there?

1636
01:31:13,468 --> 01:31:15,136
Yes.

1637
01:31:18,431 --> 01:31:21,309
Bundy: Did you get what
you came here for?

1638
01:31:21,351 --> 01:31:23,019
Do you know why I did it?

1639
01:31:27,983 --> 01:31:31,069
Because you wanted to.

1640
01:31:37,242 --> 01:31:39,536
I hope to see you
on the other side.

1641
01:31:43,623 --> 01:31:45,500
Could be.

1642
01:32:11,776 --> 01:32:16,948
Crowd: I na na na na,
hey hey, goodbye I

1643
01:32:16,990 --> 01:32:24,873
I na na na na,
hey hey, goodbye I

1644
01:32:24,914 --> 01:32:27,584
Florida state prison.

1645
01:32:27,625 --> 01:32:28,877
I'm sorry.

1646
01:32:28,918 --> 01:32:32,422
He's not available
at the moment.

1647
01:32:32,464 --> 01:32:35,175
I'll be sure
to give the message.

1648
01:32:39,137 --> 01:32:41,598
Look, bill.

1649
01:32:41,639 --> 01:32:44,726
The warden invited
a family down.

1650
01:32:44,768 --> 01:32:47,270
- To watch?
- Yeah.

1651
01:32:47,312 --> 01:32:50,398
And they did a head count.

1652
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:53,735
I was supposed to have a seat.

1653
01:32:53,777 --> 01:32:55,487
Florida state prison.

1654
01:32:55,528 --> 01:32:58,281
I'm sorry. He's not available
at the moment.

1655
01:32:58,323 --> 01:32:59,763
I'll be sure
to give him the message.

1656
01:33:02,494 --> 01:33:04,746
It's the warden's discretion.

1657
01:33:04,788 --> 01:33:06,581
He must have a big family.

1658
01:33:06,623 --> 01:33:09,084
He does.

1659
01:33:09,125 --> 01:33:10,919
I'm sorry.

1660
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:12,170
They're ready for you, Paul.

1661
01:33:14,422 --> 01:33:16,508
Paul: I got to walk him down.

1662
01:33:16,549 --> 01:33:17,967
Can you man the phones?

1663
01:33:18,009 --> 01:33:20,095
Yeah.

1664
01:33:26,351 --> 01:33:28,186
Florida state prison.

1665
01:33:28,228 --> 01:33:30,271
Man: Is Ted Bundy there.

1666
01:33:30,313 --> 01:33:32,190
I'm sorry. He's not available
at the moment.

1667
01:33:32,232 --> 01:33:34,859
Man: When you see him, will
you tell him, I smell bacon?!

1668
01:33:59,884 --> 01:34:01,719
Boy: Hello. Hagmaier residence.

1669
01:34:01,761 --> 01:34:03,138
Hey, sport.

1670
01:34:03,179 --> 01:34:05,431
Boy: Oh, hi, papa.
I'm so excited!

1671
01:34:05,473 --> 01:34:07,233
I wanted to tell you
about this thing that...

1672
01:34:09,686 --> 01:34:11,312
That's great, buddy.

1673
01:34:11,354 --> 01:34:12,772
That's great.

1674
01:34:12,814 --> 01:34:14,232
Is mama around?

1675
01:34:17,610 --> 01:34:19,237
There's more.

1676
01:34:19,279 --> 01:34:22,157
Like, the pirates
have all these swords.

1677
01:34:27,620 --> 01:34:29,455
That's wonderful, buddy.

1678
01:34:29,497 --> 01:34:32,167
Um, yeah, can you put
mama on the phone?
