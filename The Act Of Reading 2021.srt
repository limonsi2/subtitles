was after the last grades

to get credit for,

What would be helpful
for me to think of, at least,

a really bad sunburn.

00:16:00,176 --> 00:16:01,569
Beautiful.

340
00:16:01,612 --> 00:16:04,528
And then from here,
we'll see if we can roll back

341
00:16:04,572 --> 00:16:07,096
onto your shoulder blades.

342
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:11,927
It's like a super-late
book report, film-form,

343
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,929
um, for his high school
English teacher

344
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,670
because he didn't read it
in high school

345
00:16:15,713 --> 00:16:17,106
-and failed the class.
-Shut up!

346
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,717
-He failed?
-Yeah, he failed American Lit.

347
00:16:19,761 --> 00:16:22,068
Okay, take a second.
Lift your ribs
for just a second.

348
00:16:22,111 --> 00:16:23,417
See if you can come back up.

349
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,679
So you know that Herman Melville

350
00:16:24,722 --> 00:16:26,681
was my
great-great-great-grandfather?

351
00:16:27,464 --> 00:16:28,900
What? [LAUGHS]

352
00:16:28,944 --> 00:16:31,033
And then in school,
everybody hated Moby-Dick,

353
00:16:31,077 --> 00:16:33,731
so I... You know, you really
didn't want to tell
your classmates that,

354
00:16:33,775 --> 00:16:36,125
"Oh, yeah, well,
my great-great-grandfather
wrote that thing."

355
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:37,953
"Shut up!"

356
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,695
I wrote this play based
on Herman Melville,

357
00:16:40,738 --> 00:16:44,220
also called Poor Herman
that's, um...

358
00:16:44,264 --> 00:16:46,092
Yeah, that I've been working on.

359
00:16:46,135 --> 00:16:48,050
That's so weird!

360
00:16:48,094 --> 00:16:50,531
He has to meet you. This is...

361
00:16:50,574 --> 00:16:53,142
-Yeah, I would really like
to meet him.
-Oh, my God.

362
00:16:53,186 --> 00:16:56,667
ELIZABETH: I also made the play
about Herman Melville's wife
and daughters

363
00:16:56,711 --> 00:16:59,409
and I wrote my gender,

364
00:16:59,453 --> 00:17:01,933
yeah, into the...
into the family.

365
00:17:01,977 --> 00:17:04,110
Do you, like,
resemble Melville at all?

366
00:17:04,153 --> 00:17:06,764
Um, well, some people say
in my family,

367
00:17:06,808 --> 00:17:09,854
this, like, cheekbone-eye thing.

368
00:17:10,942 --> 00:17:13,206
Um, I think...

369
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:19,342
He's like, broad
through the chest
and sort of high cheeks.

370
00:17:19,386 --> 00:17:20,996
Everybody said he was handsome.

371
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,476
[ALISSA LAUGHS]

372
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:24,652
-So I like to think
I resemble him.
-[ALL LAUGH]

373
00:17:24,695 --> 00:17:27,263
I don't know,
if I have a big beard...

374
00:17:27,307 --> 00:17:29,700
Or you know, I'm not...
I'm not so large.

375
00:17:29,744 --> 00:17:32,181
But in my heart,
I'm like a big man.

376
00:17:34,009 --> 00:17:37,795
BERGMAN:
Melville was ill at the time.
He had a form of the flu.

377
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:40,276
And when he was found
by a local tribe,

378
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,236
he was near death,
and they nursed him
back to life.

379
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:46,152
They offered him a membership
in the tribe.

380
00:17:46,804 --> 00:17:48,980
Sadly, it would mean

381
00:17:49,024 --> 00:17:51,287
for him being tattooed
from head to foot.

382
00:17:51,331 --> 00:17:52,419
[CHUCKLES]

383
00:17:54,203 --> 00:17:55,987
So he said "No, thank you."

384
00:17:56,031 --> 00:17:57,467
And they said
"It's not a problem.

385
00:17:57,511 --> 00:17:59,730
"We understand.
But we're so fond of you,

386
00:17:59,774 --> 00:18:01,993
"we're going to offer you
the other option.

387
00:18:02,037 --> 00:18:05,214
"We're going to elevate you
to the top of the menu."

388
00:18:05,258 --> 00:18:06,781
They were a cannibal tribe.

389
00:18:07,564 --> 00:18:09,175
He ran off again.

390
00:18:09,218 --> 00:18:12,743
He decided to visit
old family friends, the Shaws.

391
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,965
Lemuel Shaw was by now
the Chief Justice

392
00:18:17,008 --> 00:18:20,360
of the Massachusetts
Judicial Supreme Court,

393
00:18:20,403 --> 00:18:24,146
and he had sons,
and he had a daughter
named Elizabeth.

394
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:27,193
Elizabeth fell in love
with Herman.

395
00:18:27,236 --> 00:18:28,890
ELIZABETH: Lizzie
could have married any doctor,

396
00:18:28,933 --> 00:18:30,631
any lawyer, any judge,

397
00:18:30,674 --> 00:18:33,721
but Herman came back
from being overseas,

398
00:18:33,764 --> 00:18:36,724
and he was like hot,
and tan, and built.

399
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:38,769
So she's like, "That guy."

400
00:18:38,813 --> 00:18:40,380
BERGMAN: He was
a very handsome man.

401
00:18:40,423 --> 00:18:45,515
Five-foot-ten, sturdy,
broad-shouldered with a tan,

402
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:48,083
and apparently,
a beautiful speaking voice.

403
00:18:48,997 --> 00:18:51,347
Very mesmerizing.

404
00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:53,262
She told her father
she was going to marry him,

405
00:18:53,306 --> 00:18:55,917
and her father said,
"Absolutely not.

406
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,181
"This is a man
with no money, no education.

407
00:18:59,225 --> 00:19:01,575
"He's been a sailor
for five years

408
00:19:01,618 --> 00:19:03,968
"and you know what they do."

409
00:19:04,012 --> 00:19:07,711
And he said, "This is
not a possible marriage.

410
00:19:07,755 --> 00:19:09,322
"How is he going to
support you?"

411
00:19:09,365 --> 00:19:11,280
She said, "Well,
he's going to be a writer."

412
00:19:11,324 --> 00:19:13,848
And her father said,
"Exactly, how is he going to
support you?"

413
00:19:13,891 --> 00:19:16,198
[CHUCKLES]

414
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:21,595
So the play finds Herman ready
to move to Pittsfield,

415
00:19:21,638 --> 00:19:24,119
frustrated by his lack
of success,

416
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,861
and he's gonna, um...
He's gonna write Moby-Dick.

417
00:19:26,904 --> 00:19:29,820
So this is sort of like...
Almost like a prologue scene.

418
00:19:29,864 --> 00:19:31,300
MARK: You should be
Poor Herman.

419
00:19:31,344 --> 00:19:33,259
ELIZABETH: Yeah,
we should do that.

420
00:19:33,302 --> 00:19:36,349
I never have really gotten
to act in it before.
That would be fun.

421
00:19:36,392 --> 00:19:39,656
MARK: And, Alissa you should be,
uh, Herman's wife.

422
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,789
She's also never really
acted before.

423
00:19:41,832 --> 00:19:43,269
ALISSA: I acted
when I was a kid.

424
00:19:43,312 --> 00:19:45,053
I just, you know,
got stage fright once

425
00:19:45,096 --> 00:19:46,359
and then never did it again.

426
00:19:51,277 --> 00:19:56,543
I just had a dream
with the answer in it.

427
00:19:56,586 --> 00:19:58,893
We must move to the country!

Oh, too many people here
making god-awful noise!

430
00:20:03,941 --> 00:20:06,553
Spewing nonsense
from their blowholes

431
00:20:06,596 --> 00:20:09,860
such that I cannot
think straight!

432
00:20:09,904 --> 00:20:12,123
Without stimulation,
what will you write about?

433
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:20,044
On this island,
my writing lies stuck inside me.

434
00:20:20,088 --> 00:20:24,875
I can't see my inner forest
through the smog of the city.

435
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:28,270
Like a corseted woman
at a banquet,

436
00:20:28,314 --> 00:20:30,577
I am starved and squished,

437
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,015
and bound too tight
to even taste a morsel.

438
00:20:37,192 --> 00:20:39,020
If the Harper Brothers
forget you,

439
00:20:39,063 --> 00:20:40,978
who will publish you then?

440
00:20:41,022 --> 00:20:44,025
The field mice,
and the summer squash?

441
00:20:44,068 --> 00:20:47,681
Nathaniel Hawthorne

without pounding
this Manhattan pavement

443
00:20:50,031 --> 00:20:52,294
like a draft horse
at death's door.

00:20:52,947 --> 00:20:54,340
Oh.

00:20:54,383 --> 00:20:56,820
You wish to be
Nathaniel Hawthorne?

00:20:57,778 --> 00:20:59,170
Would you still love me?

00:21:00,476 --> 00:21:02,348
ALISSA: We just left Boston.

448
00:21:02,391 --> 00:21:04,480
Everyone will think
you can't hack it here.

00:21:04,524 --> 00:21:06,787
Why, I was born on this island,

450
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,833

as I please.

as I take root,

you pluck me up.

Far better it is to cover ground
than be buried in it!

454
00:21:17,928 --> 00:21:22,890
Why, I've sailed and swum
and searched this Earth

00:21:22,933 --> 00:21:24,544
to its antipodes!

My dear Lizzie,
we may share a bed and a roof,

I've already borrowed the money

as a loan
against your inheritance.

463

I'm writing a light-hearted take
on the whaling industry.

Here, I write in great haste,
dizzied by distraction.

00:22:02,103 --> 00:22:04,758
In the country,
I will write in slow-motion.

469
00:22:06,237 --> 00:22:08,979
There, my dear Lizzie,

470
00:22:09,023 --> 00:22:13,375
I will write something
worthy of your struggle.

471
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:17,118
With his last words,
I am ousted from the argument

472
00:22:17,161 --> 00:22:19,338
before I can tell him.

473
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:21,731
He'll soon need
to write for three.

474
00:22:26,214 --> 00:22:28,999
Initially, there was
a little unrest.

475
00:22:29,043 --> 00:22:32,525
His wife was not happy
with the physical layout
of the house.

476
00:22:32,568 --> 00:22:34,744
She wanted to take out
the central chimney,

477
00:22:34,788 --> 00:22:36,485
which is mammoth,

478
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:40,576
um, and replace it with a grand
front hall and staircase.

479
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:44,058
Melville immortalized
that battle in his work,

480
00:22:44,101 --> 00:22:47,409
1856 work, I And My Chimney.

481
00:22:47,453 --> 00:22:50,934
This is the singular
most important sentence,

482
00:22:50,978 --> 00:22:53,372
and it's how Melville saw
his future.

483
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:56,723
"I and my chimney
are settling together."

484
00:22:56,766 --> 00:22:58,420
He saw himself as an old man,

485
00:22:58,464 --> 00:23:00,509
sitting here in front
of the fireplace,

486
00:23:00,553 --> 00:23:05,122
enjoying all that he had
brought together in this place.

487
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:07,298
And that sadly never happened.

488
00:23:07,342 --> 00:23:10,737
MARK: Was manic-depressiveness
in the Melville lineage?

489
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,521
It would seem so.

490
00:23:12,565 --> 00:23:16,133
His father certainly
went through very heavy
depressive phases.

491
00:23:16,177 --> 00:23:18,222
Brought him to his early death.

492
00:23:18,266 --> 00:23:21,835
His son, Malcolm,
ultimately committed suicide,

493
00:23:21,878 --> 00:23:25,447
shooting himself in the head
with his service revolver.

494
00:23:25,491 --> 00:23:26,970
-MARK: Oh, dear.
-Yeah, not the...

495
00:23:27,014 --> 00:23:28,537

497
00:23:30,974 --> 00:23:35,805
Do your cousins still have,
like, issues with up and down?

00:23:35,849 --> 00:23:39,809
I wasn't gonna bring up
my mother,
but now that you mention it.

499
00:23:39,853 --> 00:23:41,724
Um, you can see it.

00:23:41,768 --> 00:23:43,160
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

They're a very dark family.

00:23:48,557 --> 00:23:52,039
We should move on into the...
Um, the guest parlor.

504
00:23:52,082 --> 00:23:53,388
The north parlor.

00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,650
Let's do that.

00:23:54,694 --> 00:23:55,695

00:31:23,185 --> 00:31:27,276
So reading is basically
a brand-new circuit
for the brain.

675
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,671
A little child has
a very basic circuit

676
00:31:30,714 --> 00:31:33,021
and can decode words.

677
00:31:33,065 --> 00:31:35,937
But over time,
the processes move

678
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:38,940
from basically perceiving print

679
00:31:38,984 --> 00:31:43,945
to binding perception
with cognition in ever more
elaborate ways.

680
00:31:43,989 --> 00:31:49,342
And all these processes change
what is read to what is thought.

681
00:31:49,385 --> 00:31:54,347
So really, the act of reading
is the change from perception
to cognition,

682
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:57,698
and that changes
the circuitry over time.

683
00:31:57,741 --> 00:31:59,352
It changes the reader itself.

684
00:31:59,395 --> 00:32:01,789
We literally change
with reading.

685
00:32:06,837 --> 00:32:08,187
How did that make you feel?

686
00:32:11,581 --> 00:32:14,236
That I wanted a coffee.

687
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,977
I was thinking about coffee
the whole time

688
00:32:16,021 --> 00:32:17,152
[CHUCKLES]

689
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:19,285
Okay, let's go get a coffee.

690
00:32:23,376 --> 00:32:25,856
KRIS: I can't read out loud.
I never read out loud.

691
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,207
-MARK: Well, do you usually
read in your head?
-KRIS: I don't...

692
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,383
MARK: 'Cause when you read
in your head, you weren't
very cooperative, Kris.

693
00:32:30,426 --> 00:32:34,735
KRIS: 'Cause then when
I read in my head,
I don't read linear.

694
00:32:36,345 --> 00:32:37,346
I skim.

695
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:42,264
MARK:
What are you working on, Rory?

696
00:32:42,308 --> 00:32:44,658
Um, I'm drawing Popo's kitchen.

697
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,748
CALEB: And who's Popo?

698
00:32:47,791 --> 00:32:52,187
Popo's my bear
that goes to Take Flight
with me and has dyslexia.

699
00:32:55,408 --> 00:32:57,801
CALEB: I love it.
Can you put Popo
somewhere in his house?

700
00:32:58,933 --> 00:33:00,456
RORY: Mm-hm. Hm.

701
00:33:01,805 --> 00:33:03,372
He can't really fit in there.

702
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,898
So every time we sat down
with anything letter-related,

703
00:33:07,942 --> 00:33:10,031
it was just like
a whole new lesson every time.

704
00:33:10,075 --> 00:33:11,990
Every time.

705
00:33:12,033 --> 00:33:14,122
And so it was just
the repetition of having
to start over again from scratch

706
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:16,168
was our first sign.

707
00:33:16,211 --> 00:33:19,606
And then as a teacher myself,
and watching my other daughter
learn to read,

708
00:33:19,649 --> 00:33:21,912
just kind of the natural signs
that you see

709
00:33:21,956 --> 00:33:23,479
where they're trying to read
what's in their environment

710
00:33:23,523 --> 00:33:25,133
and trying to sound out things,

711
00:33:25,177 --> 00:33:28,441
uh, Rory was really stuck
with it at like, one level

712
00:33:28,484 --> 00:33:30,356
for a very, very,
very long time.

713

"Hurrying down to

"Ch... Ikens..."

719
00:33:49,462 --> 00:33:51,333
GRANDMOTHER: "Church."
RORY: "Church."

00:33:51,377 --> 00:33:53,074
GRANDMOTHER:

721
00:33:53,118 --> 00:33:55,685
Do you want to try one more page
maybe by yourself?

722
00:33:55,729 --> 00:33:57,600
RORY: Okay.
GRANDMOTHER: Okay.

723
00:33:57,644 --> 00:34:04,607
It looks all weird,
and it's like the letters
are like, doubling

724
00:34:04,651 --> 00:34:08,611
and they're like jumping
and like, flipping over
and stuff.

725
00:34:09,525 --> 00:34:12,224
And it gives me a headache,

726
00:34:12,267 --> 00:34:16,880
and there's like all these
big words that are,
like, confusing.

727
00:34:16,924 --> 00:34:19,883
And so, it's really annoying

728
00:34:19,927 --> 00:34:24,888
and hard when I try to read.

729
00:34:24,932 --> 00:34:29,980
One of the more amazing aspects
of my work is to understand

730
00:34:30,024 --> 00:34:35,203
that our individuals
with dyslexia have a different
brain organization.

731
00:34:35,247 --> 00:34:40,121
One that's been with us
for all the 50,000 years

732
00:34:40,165 --> 00:34:43,472
that we have been on this Earth
as homo sapiens

733
00:34:43,516 --> 00:34:47,476
but one that organizes
language differently.

734
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,391
Especially written language.

735
00:34:49,435 --> 00:34:53,091
So when a dyslexic individual
is reading,

736
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:56,746
they are going to actually
activate areas

737
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,748
in the right hemisphere

738
00:34:58,792 --> 00:35:04,014
and hold on to them
in a way that makes
a kind of delay

739
00:35:04,058 --> 00:35:06,321
in how fast
they process that word.

740
00:35:10,499 --> 00:35:13,154

-Really?
-Oh yeah, when I write...
When I type my notes,

00:35:55,892 --> 00:35:58,243

without thinking,

751
00:35:59,983 --> 00:36:03,291

will be backwards.

752
00:36:04,684 --> 00:36:06,599
-Oh.
-It's really interesting.

753
00:36:06,642 --> 00:36:09,036
-Oh, so you are dyslexic.
-Yeah.

754
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,172
No one ever told me anything.

00:36:14,215 --> 00:36:17,740
They just bounced me
from room to room.

756
00:36:17,784 --> 00:36:21,048
And now,
everyone's concerned about,
you know, labels and stuff.

757
00:36:21,091 --> 00:36:23,833
It's like, "Okay, if you want
to call me dyslexic, call me..."
you know...

758
00:36:23,877 --> 00:36:27,054
-[LAUGHS]
-That's fine.
That doesn't help me.

759
00:36:27,097 --> 00:36:29,796
Well, it could be different.
I mean, I could probably find
a backwards Moby-Dick

00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:33,321
-for dyslexics or something.
-Uh... It's too late.

761
00:36:36,585 --> 00:36:40,676
The early circuit has to...
has to form,

762
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,200
you know, the connections,

763
00:36:42,243 --> 00:36:44,637
has to repurpose these neurons,

764
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:48,293
and then, has to become
so automatic and fluent

765
00:36:48,336 --> 00:36:53,994
by around third or fourth grade
that the thinking stuff

766
00:36:54,037 --> 00:36:58,346
-really can become hinged.
-Mm-hmm.

767
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:04,831
And that becomes a new,
thinking reader. Or not.

768
00:37:04,874 --> 00:37:08,965
And that's another story
that you may or may not
want for this

769
00:37:09,009 --> 00:37:13,274
but that fourth grade
is what I call "the black hole
of American education."

770
00:37:13,318 --> 00:37:18,845
If the kids aren't fluent enough
by then, if the circuit's
not automatic enough by then,

00:37:18,888 --> 00:37:21,630
the "deep reading" processes
that are so important

you get characters looking

That reveals something

Sometimes looking in the water

00:40:50,143 --> 00:40:54,495
But they are plans that
I need to just let go because,

840
00:40:56,192 --> 00:40:57,890
they weren't going to happen.

841
00:40:58,978 --> 00:41:00,849
I haven't acted on them.

842
00:41:02,721 --> 00:41:04,505
And,

843
00:41:04,549 --> 00:41:06,725
it would be...
It could be a way of letting go.

844
00:41:29,704 --> 00:41:32,881
When he moved here,
he had written a book called,
The Whale

845
00:41:32,925 --> 00:41:36,102
which was based on the adventure
of the whaleship Essex

846
00:41:36,145 --> 00:41:39,148
which was capsized
by a giant whale
in the Pacific

847
00:41:39,192 --> 00:41:41,847
-when Melville
was only one year old.
-MAR: Mm-hmm.

848
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:44,197
But after meeting
Nathaniel Hawthorne,

849
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,243
basically scuttled the book
and rewrote it as Moby-Dick.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

851
00:41:48,462 --> 00:41:50,769
Oh, now what, Augusta?

852
00:41:55,861 --> 00:41:57,906
Oh, you've come back.

853
00:41:58,603 --> 00:41:59,908
HAWTHORNE: Yes.

854
00:41:59,952 --> 00:42:02,563
Oh, my dear Hawthorne.

855
00:42:02,607 --> 00:42:05,784
I had pretty much made up
my mind to be annihilated,

856
00:42:05,827 --> 00:42:09,570
but now, you're here.

857
00:42:09,614 --> 00:42:12,312
I've always appreciated
your enthusiastic greetings,
Herman.

858
00:42:12,355 --> 00:42:17,317
Oh it's you that titillates me
till I'm a giddy schoolgirl!
[CHUCKLES]

00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,362
Shall I carry your books
as we stroll?

860
00:42:19,406 --> 00:42:22,278
HERMAN: Like that fated day
we met in Berkshire.

861
00:42:22,322 --> 00:42:24,411
Oh that fated day
that brought me here

862
00:42:24,454 --> 00:42:28,197
to live a stone's throw
from you. And now,

863
00:42:28,241 --> 00:42:32,637
only old Mount Greylock
stands between our two abodes.

864
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:35,640
How I love to watch you
come down that mountain.

865
00:42:35,683 --> 00:42:41,080
But, today your descent
eluded me.

866
00:42:41,123 --> 00:42:45,040
And how I came day after day
as you made for me
one Moby-Dick.

867
00:42:46,651 --> 00:42:49,871
That's why we reside here
in Berkshire.

868
00:42:49,915 --> 00:42:56,008
So we might write wicked books
that need not be laced
with rose petals.

You are my lifeboat
as I've walked the plank.

[INHALES]

873
00:43:07,976 --> 00:43:11,284
The physical affair between
Herman and Nathaniel

874
00:43:11,327 --> 00:43:15,288
seems highly unlikely
since Nathaniel hated
to be touched.

875
00:43:15,331 --> 00:43:17,595
And you can have
a psychological affair
with someone

876
00:43:17,638 --> 00:43:20,206
but you can't touch them,
you can't have
a physical affair.

877
00:43:20,249 --> 00:43:24,732
-So there's rumors out there
that Nathaniel and Herman had...
-A love affair.

00:43:24,776 --> 00:43:26,342
-...a love affair?
-Yeah.

879
00:43:26,386 --> 00:43:28,823
PETER: It's so eloquently
put into words by Melville.

880
00:43:28,867 --> 00:43:31,086
You gotta say,
"Well, who's kidding who?"

881
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:33,523
But whether or not
they actually had
a physical relationship,

882
00:43:33,567 --> 00:43:35,525
I don't think anybody
can verify it.

883
00:43:35,569 --> 00:43:36,788
But Hawthorne was gorgeous.

884
00:43:37,789 --> 00:43:40,487
He was when he was young.

885
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:42,184
He was everything Melville
wasn't in a way.

886
00:43:42,228 --> 00:43:44,186
But Melville was everything
he wasn't.

887
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:47,886
Right. They were two
total opposites.

888
00:43:47,929 --> 00:43:50,149
-Which usually attract, right?
-Often.

889
00:43:50,192 --> 00:43:51,541
Yeah.

890
00:43:51,585 --> 00:43:54,109
Monument Mountain
where Melville...

891
00:43:54,153 --> 00:43:57,417
uh, first met
Nathaniel Hawthorne
and became friends with him.

892
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:02,552
And when he met
Nathaniel Hawthorne,
they uh... they had a picnic,

893
00:44:02,596 --> 00:44:06,469
and Hawthorne convinced him
to take Moby-Dick

894
00:44:06,513 --> 00:44:09,211
into like a very
different direction
than he ended up,

895

Well, no. Yesterday,

But, I forgot.
So, I'm off my pills.

I'm not ready to have a child.

Emotionally, I'm not ready.

coming at it

I don't know what
the right reasons
are supposed to be, Mark.

What do you think
the right reasons are, then?

I mean, isn't this enough?

Like, can't we just
be a couple for a little bit?

but you don't let yourself
be creative

the path of least resistance
is making a baby

I think is every woman's right
to do, but, like,

if you have other things
you can do,

00:45:50,095 --> 00:45:51,531
I think you should do them, too.

This bed is a Melville bed.

940
00:47:28,193 --> 00:47:32,327
It was purchased for us
at an auction.

941
00:47:32,371 --> 00:47:35,678
There were always
at least three,
if not five people

942
00:47:35,722 --> 00:47:37,376
sleeping in this room.

943
00:47:37,419 --> 00:47:41,902
Herman and Lizzie,
and at least two or three
of their children.

944
00:47:41,946 --> 00:47:44,905
The children were always placed
closer to the fireplace

945
00:47:44,949 --> 00:47:47,038
for the additional warmth.

946
00:47:47,081 --> 00:47:51,520
The difficulty of this room
isn't having children in it.

947
00:47:51,564 --> 00:47:54,393
It's the door behind me.

948
00:47:54,436 --> 00:47:57,570
That door leads
to three more bedrooms.

Two of his sisters
were ensconced
in the outer ones

and directly behind
the head of the bed,
was Herman's mother.

-MARK: Oh.
-Yeah.

952
00:48:08,624 --> 00:48:12,715
This is the only door
into that suite of rooms.

953
00:48:12,759 --> 00:48:15,066
So anytime anybody came in
or went out,

954
00:48:15,109 --> 00:48:18,069
they went by Herman in bed.

00:48:18,112 --> 00:48:21,159
There's talk that there
must have been
an outhouse at one point.

But early on,
everyone used chamber pots.

You woke up, you did what
you needed to do,

958
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:31,256
and you carried your chamber pot
through this room
to take it outside.

00:48:32,866 --> 00:48:35,216

known as Fanny

967

and provided us
with descendants like Peter.

00:49:03,157 --> 00:49:05,681
Any questions about this room?

969
00:49:05,725 --> 00:49:07,901
The floorboards are original
to the house.

970
00:49:08,989 --> 00:49:10,077
Nice.

971
00:49:23,525 --> 00:49:27,094
SAMUEL: [READING]
"A certain significance
lurks in all things."

972
00:49:27,138 --> 00:49:29,879
That seems to be
a key sentence for the book.

973
00:49:29,923 --> 00:49:34,101
Uh, the book presents the world
as suffused,

974
00:49:34,145 --> 00:49:36,060
as charged with meaning.

975
00:49:36,103 --> 00:49:38,714
Um, everywhere
the narrator looks,

976
00:49:38,758 --> 00:49:43,545
He interprets, he manipulates,
he speculates.

977
00:49:43,589 --> 00:49:45,808
It's one of the pleasures
of the book.

978
00:49:45,852 --> 00:49:49,595
But to me the most
interesting word in that
sentence is "lurks."

979
00:49:49,638 --> 00:49:53,381
It's not "a certain significance
is in all things"

980
00:49:53,425 --> 00:49:55,340
or "lies in all things"...

981
00:49:55,383 --> 00:49:59,083
The world "lurks"
with significance.

982
00:49:59,126 --> 00:50:00,998
There's something unsettling.

983
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:02,912
There's something unsteady.

984
00:50:02,956 --> 00:50:04,610
There's something ominous

985
00:50:04,653 --> 00:50:08,092
about the acts
of interpretation
that the book provokes.

986
00:50:12,226 --> 00:50:14,837
CALVIN: I got really frustrated
because I didn't understand

987
00:50:14,881 --> 00:50:17,710
any of the references
or allusions to the Bible.

988
00:50:20,104 --> 00:50:21,975
So I just started doing flips.

989
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,238
And that's kind of like
an escape.

990
00:50:24,282 --> 00:50:27,502
It gets my anger out,
and it resets my mood.

991
00:50:29,113 --> 00:50:30,984
I don't know.
I don't get angry too often,

992
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:33,334
so it's like kind of
a special occasion when I do.

993
00:50:33,378 --> 00:50:35,380
but not like the good kind
of special.

994
00:50:35,423 --> 00:50:37,599
I was doing double
front-flip, landed.

995
00:50:37,643 --> 00:50:40,515
And I was just repeating those
over and over again.

996
00:50:51,222 --> 00:50:53,833
CALVIN'S MOTHER:
He had fractured
three of the vertebrae

997
00:50:53,876 --> 00:50:56,183
in the top part
of his thoracic area

998
00:50:56,227 --> 00:50:59,317
and two other
are very suspicious.

999
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,579
So now he's in a neck brace,

1000
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:04,017
[CHUCKLES] for six weeks,

1001
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:08,456
and he'll be restricted
from movement for almost
three months.

1002
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:11,024
That's not good.

1003
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,417
MARK: Is he supposed
to be wearing the neck brace
right now?

1004
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:13,548

01:25:46,619 --> 01:25:49,492
JANET: I thought the remark
of the young woman
in the teacher's class...

1662
01:25:49,535 --> 01:25:52,190
-MARTA: Yeah. The blonde girl.
-JANET: Yeah, the blonde girl,
who said...

1663
01:25:52,234 --> 01:25:55,106
Finding, like,
your own free will,
and whatever,

1664
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:58,631
is, like hard,
and like confusing?

1665
01:25:58,675 --> 01:26:00,981
That life is confusing and,
you know,

1666
01:26:01,025 --> 01:26:03,549
finding meaning is like
a super-big challenge

1667
01:26:03,593 --> 01:26:05,464
and so, the act
of reading the book

1668
01:26:05,508 --> 01:26:08,380
is almost like
the journey through life

1669
01:26:08,424 --> 01:26:11,035
-and attempting to find meaning.
-But you don't have...

1670
01:26:11,078 --> 01:26:12,906
-KRIS: You don't need
two hours of that!
-Yeah.
