00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:30,400
Hey, Mr. Schiller.

6
00:00:30,533 --> 00:00:31,567
Merry Christmas!

7
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,767
Hey, Lou,
Merry Christmas!

8
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:33,734
How are you?

9
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:34,700
I'm good.

10
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:35,700
Are you ready
for the big winner?

11
00:00:35,834 --> 00:00:38,233
Just a few more customers.

12
00:00:38,367 --> 00:00:40,000
I haven't seen
your brother yet, though.

13
00:00:40,133 --> 00:00:42,633
Uh, yeah, he should be here
any minute.

14
00:00:42,767 --> 00:00:44,734
Hey, what's this I hear
about you leaving Pine Grove?

15
00:00:44,867 --> 00:00:46,433
I'm headed to New York
to write.

16
00:00:46,567 --> 00:00:47,867
Well, isn't that
what you're doing

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,834
for the newspaper?

18
00:00:48,967 --> 00:00:50,100
Yes,

19
00:00:50,233 --> 00:00:51,500
but I'm going there to finish
a novel that I started.

20
00:00:51,633 --> 00:00:52,567
A novel?

21
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,700
Mm-hmm.

22
00:00:53,834 --> 00:00:55,433
Um, I love Pine Grove,

23
00:00:55,567 --> 00:00:56,433
but it's time for a change.

24
00:00:56,567 --> 00:00:58,533
Well, you will be missed.

25
00:00:58,667 --> 00:01:00,433
but I wish you
all the luck in the world.

26
00:01:00,567 --> 00:01:01,266
Hey, there he is.

27
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,266
Hey, sorry,

28
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,367
-I didn't miss it, did I?
-No.

29
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,834
Jeralyn thought
she was going into labor,

30
00:01:04,967 --> 00:01:07,633
but it was a false alarm.

31
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:09,100
This is it, this is it.

32
00:01:09,233 --> 00:01:10,000
Attention everyone!

33
00:01:10,133 --> 00:01:11,000
Attention!

34
00:01:11,133 --> 00:01:12,467
Everyone, attention!

35
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,166
The Schiller Family
Christmas Tree Farm

36
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,166
is happy to announce

37
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,100
that we just hit a milestone.

38
00:01:17,233 --> 00:01:21,367
This tree marks number 50,000!

39
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,767
-Oh!
-Wow.

40
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,834
And the lucky winners are...

41
00:01:24,967 --> 00:01:25,667
Aaron and Beth Taylor.

42
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,066
Aaron and Beth Taylor!

43
00:01:28,567 --> 00:01:31,767
You two are going home
with a check

44
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,500
for $5,000...

45
00:01:33,633 --> 00:01:35,333
-What?

46
00:01:35,467 --> 00:01:36,934
...and, of course,

47
00:01:37,066 --> 00:01:38,000
a free Christmas tree!

48
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,066
Are you kidding?

49
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,033
Wow!

50
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:43,800
We've never won anything before.

51
00:01:43,934 --> 00:01:45,133
Thank you so much!

52
00:01:45,266 --> 00:01:47,100
What a wonderful
Christmas gift!

53
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:49,667
Can I interview you two
for The Pine Grove Register?

54
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,834
Sure! You know...

55
00:01:50,967 --> 00:01:52,767
we've never been interviewed
before, either.

56
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,934
Brice, get a few more pictures
real quick.

57
00:01:55,066 --> 00:01:56,600
Yep, that's the one.

58
00:01:56,734 --> 00:01:57,767
Okay, you guys,
Merry Christmas!

59
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,967
-Congratulations!
-Thank you!

60
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,100
Henry's a great one,
isn't he?

61
00:02:01,533 --> 00:02:02,667
Hi.

62
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,867
How'd it go
at the Christmas tree farm?

63
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,166
It was great.

64
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,700
They had no idea
that it was gonna happen.

65
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:16,033
-You'll have it by tomorrow.
-Oh, great.

66
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:17,500
I'm uploading the photos now.

67
00:02:17,633 --> 00:02:19,467
Oh, wonderful.

68
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,700
Oh, Brice, these are great.

69
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:26,000
Which one do you want to use?

70
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:28,967
Uh, let's go with
the surprise shot.

71
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,400
Yeah, I agree with Mom.

72
00:02:31,533 --> 00:02:32,433
Brice, you absolutely
captured the moment.

73
00:02:32,567 --> 00:02:33,500
That's great.

74
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:34,934
Merry Christmas.

75
00:02:36,533 --> 00:02:39,367
The Pine Grove Candy Emporium
wants a half-page Christmas ad.

76
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,834
Honey, that's wonderful!

77
00:02:40,967 --> 00:02:41,800
I'll go let the team know

78
00:02:41,934 --> 00:02:43,500
that we need to adjust
the layout.

79
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:47,166
Hi, nephew!

80
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,066
Aunt Marcy!

81
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,066
You look great.

82
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,834
Same as you did
last time I saw you.

83
00:02:51,967 --> 00:02:52,734
What was it, two years ago?

84
00:02:52,867 --> 00:02:53,900
Well, thank you,

85
00:02:54,033 --> 00:02:55,100
I'll take that compliment,

86
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:56,400
and you actually missed
the last two Christmases,

87
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:57,567
but who's counting?

88
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,934
Well, I didn't want
to make it three in a row.

89
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:00,433
Tell that to your parents.

90
00:03:00,567 --> 00:03:02,066
Oh, they send their love
from Cancun.

91
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,200
They wished
they could have rescheduled.

92
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,967
I've heard that one before.

93
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,066
Come on inside.

94
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,800
All right.

95
00:03:07,934 --> 00:03:10,767
Is that fruitcake?

96
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,333
Did you add chocolate
to it this time?

97
00:03:12,467 --> 00:03:14,300
Ah-hah, anything else?

98
00:03:14,433 --> 00:03:15,367
Triple sec?

99
00:03:16,767 --> 00:03:18,333
It's going to be good
having you here.

100
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,100
How about
a cup of peppermint tea?

101
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,100
Yeah, sure.

102
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:22,367
Sure you don't mind
having me around

103
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,266
for the next two weeks?

104
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,066
Oh, as far as I can tell,

105
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,900
I'm getting the better
of this deal.

106
00:03:27,033 --> 00:03:29,633
And you sure you don't mind
helping me at the restaurant?

107
00:03:29,767 --> 00:03:31,567
I can't think of a better way
to spend Christmas.

108
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,767
So, how is
the job search going?

109
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,767
Oh, it's going.

110
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,467
I got a few things
I need to figure out.

111
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,500
There's not a lot of people

112
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:40,834
looking to hire a chef
around Christmas,

113
00:03:40,967 --> 00:03:41,867
but...

114
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,934
I've got some feelers out there.

115
00:03:44,066 --> 00:03:45,934
I was surprised to hear
the restaurant even closed.

116
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:47,166
Yeah, me too,

117
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,133
but times change,

118
00:03:48,266 --> 00:03:49,233
and you've got to change
with them.

119
00:03:49,367 --> 00:03:50,600
And you know the Tavern's
not as fancy

120
00:03:50,734 --> 00:03:51,567
as what you're used to.

121
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,800
It'll be a nice
change of pace.

122
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:56,300
Great job
on the Christmas Tree story.

123
00:03:56,433 --> 00:03:57,467
Thank you.

124
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,600
I am really glad

125
00:03:58,734 --> 00:04:01,133
that my final piece
was about Christmas.

126
00:04:01,266 --> 00:04:03,200
It doesn't need to be
your last piece.

127
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,700
You could cover
the Time Capsule ceremony.

128
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:07,100
It would be a great angle

129
00:04:07,233 --> 00:04:09,467
to have
the fourth-generation Webbs

130
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,133
cover the first generation.

131
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:13,467
I am dying to see
what's inside that capsule,

132
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,633
but I want to have fun with it

133
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:16,000
instead of it
turning into work.

134
00:04:16,133 --> 00:04:17,467
Well, you can't blame me
for trying.

135
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,033
I just want to keep you
around the office

136
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:20,066
for as long as possible.

137
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,567
I know...

138
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,000
but if I'm gonna finish
this book,

139
00:04:23,133 --> 00:04:25,033
I actually need the time
to dedicate to it.

140
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,200
We're gonna miss you.

141
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,367
I'm gonna miss you, too.

142
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,266
Hey, I found these photos
from the 1921 ceremony.

143
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,867
That's your
great-grandfather, Louis,

144
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
holding the time capsule.

145
00:04:37,133 --> 00:04:38,433
This is incredible.

146
00:04:38,567 --> 00:04:41,867
It's really been 100 years.

147
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,433
This is going to be
a really interesting story.

148
00:04:44,567 --> 00:04:46,433
You sure
you don't want to write it?

149
00:04:46,567 --> 00:04:48,867
Bah! No...

150
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I still have to pack,

151
00:04:50,133 --> 00:04:51,500
I'm on the Christmas show
planning committee,

152
00:04:51,633 --> 00:04:53,000
and I still have
Christmas shopping to do.

153
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:54,133
I'm booked.

154
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,633
Well, I thought I'd ask
one more time.

155
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:07,700
What's with all the cookbooks?

156
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:08,834
You changing your menu up?

157
00:05:08,967 --> 00:05:10,166
No,

158
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,100
I'm looking for a new recipe
for the "Taste of Christmas."

159
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:15,367
What's that?

160
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,800
A local charity event,

161
00:05:16,934 --> 00:05:19,867
where all the restaurants,
diners, bakeries

162
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,767
from the tri-county,

163
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,100
we set up booths,

164
00:05:22,233 --> 00:05:23,834
and then at the end of the day,
the judges come around

165
00:05:23,967 --> 00:05:25,100
and pick their favorite dishes.

166
00:05:25,233 --> 00:05:26,266
That sounds fun.

167
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,600
How come I've never heard of it?

168
00:05:27,734 --> 00:05:29,667
Well, because you haven't
been here early enough.

169
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,567
It's happens the last week
before Christmas.

170
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,633
Well, I'm here now,

171
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:34,867
you want some help?

172
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,300
You bet I do.

173
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:38,900
Especially since I lost my title
to The Fairfield Cookery

174
00:05:39,033 --> 00:05:39,900
three years in a row.

175
00:05:40,033 --> 00:05:41,600
Then let's go win it back.

176
00:05:41,734 --> 00:05:42,533
Ah!

177
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,266
I know it's a few weeks late,

178
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,867
but here's to turning 30!

179
00:05:53,367 --> 00:05:54,433
Thank you, you guys,

180
00:05:54,567 --> 00:05:55,700
you really
didn't have to do this.

181
00:05:55,834 --> 00:05:57,066
Of course we did!

182
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,266
I'm just sorry it took so long
to coordinate our schedules.

183
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,467
Well, that's what I get

184
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,300
for being best friends
with the deputy mayor

185
00:06:02,433 --> 00:06:05,433
and a busy attorney
who is about to become a mom!

186
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,633
Which means you're about
to become an aunt.

187
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:08,633
Oh, I can't wait.

188
00:06:08,767 --> 00:06:09,767
You know,
it wasn't that long ago

189
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,767
when all we thought about
were boys, clothes,

190
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,967
and really bad hair days.

191
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,667
Well, the only boy
I thought about was Brice.

192
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,934
A little sappy, but sweet.

193
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:19,533
I owe it all to you guys.

194
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:20,767
Really?

195
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,767
Yeah, it was the first day
at a new school,

196
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,033
I didn't know anyone,

197
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,800
and you two invited me
to have lunch.

198
00:06:25,934 --> 00:06:27,834
Oh, and we went over
to Lou's house afterwards

199
00:06:27,967 --> 00:06:28,834
to bake brownies.

200
00:06:28,967 --> 00:06:29,800
And we ate all of them!

201
00:06:31,133 --> 00:06:35,133
That afternoon
was the first time I saw Brice.

202
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:37,333
Then it took him three years
to notice me.

203
00:06:37,467 --> 00:06:39,133
Yeah, he's always been
a little slow

204
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:41,467
with those kind of things.

205
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,734
Promise you'll be back
for the baby's first birthday?

206
00:06:43,867 --> 00:06:44,700
Of course...

207
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:46,433
and Thanksgiving and Christmas.

208
00:06:46,567 --> 00:06:48,133
You know, if you're gonna be
coming back that often,

209
00:06:48,266 --> 00:06:49,800
maybe you should just...

210
00:06:49,934 --> 00:06:50,834
stay.

211
00:06:50,967 --> 00:06:52,767
I've always just stayed.

212
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,767
You guys have
gone after your dreams.

213
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,367
It's time I went after mine.

214
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,967
Then here's to New York...

215
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,166
And old friends,

216
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,700
and lots of video chats!

217
00:07:00,834 --> 00:07:01,800
Don't you know it.

218
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,033
You know,
after all these years,

219
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,900
I still can't tell
what the secret ingredient is

220
00:07:06,033 --> 00:07:07,066
in this sauce.

221
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,200
And I don't plan
on telling you anytime soon.

222
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,400
Maybe when I retire...

223
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:13,567
I've never heard you talk
about retiring before.

224
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,533
Well, I mean, not right now,
but someday.

225
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:17,734
But I mean, right now,
I've gotta get these orders out.

226
00:07:17,867 --> 00:07:19,734
Oh, I got it.

227
00:07:19,867 --> 00:07:20,700
Thank you.

228
00:07:20,834 --> 00:07:21,667
No problem.

229
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,667
They're for table seven.

230
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,633
Table seven, coming up.

231
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,700
I know that
New York is expensive,

232
00:07:26,834 --> 00:07:29,333
so I'll probably be eating
on the cheaper side.

233
00:07:29,467 --> 00:07:31,100
-Yes.
-Three lunch specials.

234
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,533
Here you go.

235
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:35,000
Here you are.

236
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:36,166
What are we celebrating?

237
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,533
Years of friendship
and adventures to come.

238
00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:40,400
Sounds fun.

239
00:07:40,533 --> 00:07:41,567
Can I get you guys
anything else?

240
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,767
How about some silverware?

241
00:07:43,767 --> 00:07:44,567
That would be helpful.

242
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,900
And maybe some salt and pepper?

243
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,000
Salt and pepper?

244
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:50,133
I don't think you'll need it.

245
00:07:50,266 --> 00:07:51,834
This meatloaf is perfect.

246
00:07:51,967 --> 00:07:53,066
I know the chef.

247
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,900
She uses a secret ingredient,

248
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:56,333
won't tell me what it is.

249
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:00,834
Oh, I'm putting pepper
on everything these days.

250
00:08:00,967 --> 00:08:02,333
Just a pinch of salt for me.

251
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:04,800
Sure.

252
00:08:04,934 --> 00:08:08,233
I'll take the salt
and pepper, please.

253
00:08:08,367 --> 00:08:09,133
Okay.

254
00:08:09,266 --> 00:08:11,467
Just kidding.

255
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,166
I've been eating
Marcy's meatloaf for years,

256
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,567
I know it doesn't need anything.

257
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,600
Because it's made with love.

258
00:08:15,734 --> 00:08:16,767
Lots of it.

259
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,867
Yeah.

260
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,033
Okay, uh, bon appetit.

261
00:08:24,266 --> 00:08:26,734
He is... unusual.

262
00:08:26,867 --> 00:08:28,600
He's definitely different.

263
00:08:28,734 --> 00:08:31,367
He's certainly the cutest
waiter she's ever had.

264
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,633
Thank you all for being here
on this very special evening.

265
00:08:41,767 --> 00:08:45,333
We're here tonight
to witness a historic moment.

266
00:08:49,734 --> 00:08:52,934
Our town's founders
buried this Time Capsule,

267
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:55,266
and to carry on what they began,

268
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,100
we will bury our own
Christmas Time Capsule

269
00:08:59,233 --> 00:09:00,633
on December 24th

270
00:09:00,767 --> 00:09:02,300
at our annual Christmas Show.

271
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:06,133
You're all invited

272
00:09:06,266 --> 00:09:08,033
to bring any items
you'd like to submit

273
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,333
to the newspaper office,

274
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:12,800
and the committee
will then choose those items

275
00:09:12,934 --> 00:09:15,834
that best represent
Pine Grove today.

276
00:09:15,967 --> 00:09:17,867
Now, I'd like
to turn things over

277
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,200
to Eli Webb.

278
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,667
Thank you, Mayor Townsend.

279
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,667
On behalf of my family,

280
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,166
it is an honor to carry on

281
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,700
what my grandfather,
Louis Webb, began,

282
00:09:32,834 --> 00:09:34,133
and I think it only fitting

283
00:09:34,266 --> 00:09:36,700
that my daughter,
and his namesake, Lou,

284
00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:40,000
join me in opening
this treasured box.

285
00:09:40,133 --> 00:09:42,400
-We love you, Lou!

286
00:09:42,533 --> 00:09:43,800
Let's see what mementos

287
00:09:43,934 --> 00:09:47,433
the citizens of 1921
have left for us.

288
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,066
We've got a...

289
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,133
We have a hymn book.

290
00:09:54,266 --> 00:09:56,667
-Hmm, that's nice.
-Yeah.

291
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,467
We have this beautiful
hand-crafted tree ornament.

292
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:02,934
Ooh...

293
00:10:03,066 --> 00:10:06,166
We have a menu
from the Pine Grove Tavern...

294
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,433
-Oh!

295
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,266
It's my grandfather's journal.

296
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,700
Isn't that special?

297
00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:15,967
May I?

298
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,133
Of course.

299
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,433
Oh...

300
00:10:20,567 --> 00:10:22,800
Here we go.

301
00:10:22,934 --> 00:10:24,967
We have the Christmas edition
of The Register!

302
00:10:26,567 --> 00:10:29,500
With a very interesting
headline,

303
00:10:29,633 --> 00:10:32,600
"Santa Claus Makes Unexpected
Visit to Pine Grove."

304
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,300
Who would have thought.

305
00:10:38,633 --> 00:10:41,033
What have you got there, Lou?

306
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,133
I don't know.

307
00:10:43,967 --> 00:10:44,834
Yeah, okay.

308
00:10:44,967 --> 00:10:47,100
Interesting.

309
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,300
Sure looks good to me.

310
00:10:52,433 --> 00:10:54,633
Shouldn't you taste it first?

311
00:10:54,767 --> 00:10:55,967
Ha...

312
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,467
Okay, I deserve that.

313
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,667
Here you go.

314
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,500
Thank you.

315
00:11:01,633 --> 00:11:03,734
I'm sorry
if I offended you yesterday.

316
00:11:03,867 --> 00:11:08,100
I can get pretty opinionated
when I get talking about food.

317
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:10,066
Well, I get that way
when it comes to bad grammar,

318
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,066
so...

319
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,100
Makes sense

320
00:11:12,233 --> 00:11:14,066
since you work
for the paper, right?

321
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,600
How do you know
that I write for the paper?

322
00:11:15,734 --> 00:11:17,433
I...

323
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:20,000
I may have asked Marcy
about you.

324
00:11:20,133 --> 00:11:21,767
Hmm...

325
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,834
and what else did Marcy say?

326
00:11:26,934 --> 00:11:29,567
She mentioned
that you were a Webb.

327
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,600
Just one in a long line.

328
00:11:31,734 --> 00:11:33,033
Hmm,

329
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,767
not every day you meet somebody
with a library named after them.

330
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,266
Not me,
my great-grandfather.

331
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,200
Well, that's an impressive
family history.

332
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,333
Thank you.

333
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:44,800
I suppose the Webbs have made
their mark on Pine Grove.

334
00:11:44,934 --> 00:11:46,133
What about you?

335
00:11:46,266 --> 00:11:49,166
You're heading to New York
to make a name for yourself?

336
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,233
That's what I'm hoping for.

337
00:11:50,367 --> 00:11:51,934
Maybe I'll see you around.

338
00:11:53,533 --> 00:11:55,200
Hey, Lou.

339
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,300
Did you happen to ask Marcy
about me ?

340
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,266
No.

341
00:12:07,567 --> 00:12:09,200
"He wished me
a Merry Christmas,

342
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,300
and before he departed,

343
00:12:10,433 --> 00:12:11,934
he left me a beacon,

344
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:13,667
instructing that it be placed
in a window

345
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,100
a hundred years from now,

346
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:17,100
and then,
in the blink of an eye,

347
00:12:17,233 --> 00:12:18,700
he was gone.

348
00:12:18,834 --> 00:12:21,133
There was only the sound
of distant sleigh bells

349
00:12:21,266 --> 00:12:22,600
and an infectious laugh,

350
00:12:22,734 --> 00:12:24,166
until both were lost
in the night,

351
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,600
and whether or not
anyone believes this story,

352
00:12:26,734 --> 00:12:27,600
it's Christmas,

353
00:12:27,734 --> 00:12:30,300
and that's
when the magic happens."

354
00:12:30,433 --> 00:12:31,700
That's a sweet story.

355
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,000
Mm-hmm.

356
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:34,467
It's almost like Santa
actually visited Pine Grove.

357
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,667
Grandpa always could
spin a good yarn.

358
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,467
I wonder what inspired him
to write it.

359
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,433
Probably just wanted
to bring some Christmas cheer

360
00:12:41,567 --> 00:12:42,433
to the town.

361
00:12:42,567 --> 00:12:44,467
Times were tough back then.

362
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,033
It was just after
the First World War,

363
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,967
and the way I heard it,

364
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,400
Louis almost packed it all in

365
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:50,800
and went to San Francisco

366
00:12:50,934 --> 00:12:52,834
to try his luck as a reporter,

367
00:12:52,967 --> 00:12:54,500
but he stayed
and started The Register.

368
00:12:54,633 --> 00:12:56,266
Any idea
what changed his mind?

369
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,667
You know, I never heard
that part of the story.

370
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,867
Look at this,

371
00:13:00,066 --> 00:13:02,734
it's a Christmas recipe
from the Tavern.

372
00:13:02,867 --> 00:13:04,667
Well, Marcy's gonna love this.

373
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,567
At least now we know
why this was in there.

374
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,800
Yeah, and by putting it
in the time capsule,

375
00:13:09,934 --> 00:13:11,667
it shows that Louis had
quite the sense of humor.

376
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,033
Mm-hmm.

377
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:16,834
Maybe it wasn't just a joke.

378
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,500
Okay, maybe it was.

379
00:13:21,633 --> 00:13:23,500
Now, I know most of these items
are going to go on display

380
00:13:23,633 --> 00:13:25,500
at City Hall,

381
00:13:25,633 --> 00:13:26,734
but why don't we keep
this one here?

382
00:13:26,867 --> 00:13:28,633
Just in case Santa comes back.

383
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,066
And the journal.

384
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,300
So I was thinking

385
00:13:41,433 --> 00:13:42,800
about the
"Taste of Christmas" contest.

386
00:13:42,934 --> 00:13:43,834
Yeah?

387
00:13:43,967 --> 00:13:45,667
What about ham?

388
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,734
Well, I've already done
two hams,

389
00:13:48,867 --> 00:13:49,834
a Christmas goose,

390
00:13:49,967 --> 00:13:51,166
I've even done
a Christmas steak.

391
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,000
This one's perfect.

392
00:13:52,133 --> 00:13:53,700
I'll take this one, thank you.

393
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:55,834
All right, I'll keep thinking.

394
00:13:55,967 --> 00:13:58,233
"Gingerbread house
decorating contest"?

395
00:13:58,367 --> 00:14:00,867
Is there a Christmas event
this town doesn't have?

396
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,800
I don't think so.

397
00:14:02,934 --> 00:14:04,700
While I'm here,
I need to order some desserts.

398
00:14:04,834 --> 00:14:06,266
Would you mind
opening up the restaurant?

399
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,433
I'll meet you back there.

400
00:14:07,567 --> 00:14:08,600
Yeah, I can handle that.

401
00:14:08,734 --> 00:14:09,467
All right.

402
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,600
There you are.

403
00:14:10,734 --> 00:14:12,300
Thank you.

404
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:30,200
You need some help?

405
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,900
Hey...

406
00:14:32,033 --> 00:14:34,133
Uh, yeah,
it might look like that way,

407
00:14:34,266 --> 00:14:36,700
but I think I've got it.

408
00:14:38,433 --> 00:14:39,300
You sure?

409
00:14:39,433 --> 00:14:41,400
I got it.

410
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,066
That lock has always
been tricky.

411
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,233
It's all yours.

412
00:14:54,367 --> 00:14:55,400
Let me show you.

413
00:14:55,533 --> 00:14:56,734
Okay.

414
00:15:02,633 --> 00:15:04,000
Wow.

415
00:15:04,133 --> 00:15:04,967
Thanks.

416
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,967
I'll have to remember that.

417
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,800
Oh, hey, I see
you've met my nephew.

418
00:15:08,934 --> 00:15:10,066
Nephew?

419
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,600
Yeah, I'm in town
for a couple of weeks,

420
00:15:11,734 --> 00:15:12,734
helping out for the holidays.

421
00:15:14,066 --> 00:15:15,633
Come on, let's get inside
out of the cold.

422
00:15:15,767 --> 00:15:16,800
Yeah.

423
00:15:18,433 --> 00:15:21,200
Thanks for bringing
these menus and recipes.

424
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,767
I just can't get over
this menu.

425
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,266
I have never seen
anything this old.

426
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,200
I've never heard of

427
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:29,100
a Christmas Caroler's Stew
before.

428
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,033
It must have been pretty good
if it was in the paper.

429
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,500
It's got an interesting
blend of spices.

430
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:36,500
Reminds me of a dish
I used to make.

431
00:15:36,633 --> 00:15:38,300
Oh, you like to cook?

432
00:15:39,433 --> 00:15:40,467
You could say that.

433
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,266
I'm a chef.

434
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,767
Then I'm confused.

435
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,667
Oh, up until recently
Kyle was head chef

436
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,734
at one of Chicago's
best restaurants.

437
00:15:48,867 --> 00:15:50,266
Yeah, I'm only here
for Christmas.

438
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:54,200
I brought you something else.

439
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:57,500
I found the arrangement we did
for my first solo.

440
00:15:57,633 --> 00:15:58,767
It's still really lovely,

441
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,133
and I think it could work
for the Christmas Show.

442
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,767
Lou was the soloist,

443
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,934
and the best singer
in the choir.

444
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:08,266
I just don't have the time
this year.

445
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,066
Lou's family
sponsors everything

446
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,867
from the food pantry
to the Christmas Toy Drive.

447
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,433
How do you find time to write?

448
00:16:15,567 --> 00:16:16,734
That's exactly why
I'm stepping down

449
00:16:16,867 --> 00:16:18,000
from my usual commitments,

450
00:16:18,133 --> 00:16:19,266
but, Marcy,

451
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,567
you put on a great show
every year, no matter what.

452
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,200
I'm just glad I'm here
this year to see it.

453
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,600
'Bout time.

454
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:28,100
You know, this might be
just right for Jeralyn,

455
00:16:28,233 --> 00:16:30,834
and I've got another idea.

456
00:16:30,967 --> 00:16:34,266
I have a submission
for the time capsule.

457
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,500
So, you're a chef.

458
00:16:43,867 --> 00:16:45,333
I'm in between jobs right now,

459
00:16:45,467 --> 00:16:48,700
but...
it's a long story.

460
00:16:49,834 --> 00:16:51,700
So, you are a writer
and a singer.

461
00:16:51,834 --> 00:16:53,567
I'm trying
a different kind of writing,

462
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,467
a novel,

463
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,400
but that's also a long story.

464
00:16:56,533 --> 00:16:57,867
Well,

465
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,133
seems like we're both
at a fork in the road,

466
00:17:00,266 --> 00:17:01,166
metaphorically speaking.

467
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,400
Mine was a choice

468
00:17:02,533 --> 00:17:03,767
I've been thinking about
for years.

469
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,934
Unfortunately,
mine is by circumstance,

470
00:17:08,066 --> 00:17:11,233
but it's given me
the opportunity to come here

471
00:17:11,367 --> 00:17:12,633
and spend more time
for Christmas.

472
00:17:12,767 --> 00:17:15,967
Christmas is the best time
of year in Pine Grove.

473
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,500
Yeah, I might have to
agree with you on that,

474
00:17:17,633 --> 00:17:18,800
based on what I've seen.

475
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,166
Hey, Brice!

476
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,667
Whoa...

477
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,400
These are just
today's submissions.

478
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:34,867
Wow.

479
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,266
Okay, well, here's another one
for the pile,

480
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,467
a menu from the Tavern.

481
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,767
I don't know how
you're going to narrow it down

482
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,834
to just 12.

483
00:17:41,967 --> 00:17:42,934
Good thing
it's a committee decision.

484
00:17:43,066 --> 00:17:44,100
Ooh...

485
00:17:44,233 --> 00:17:47,800
Ooh, Mom bought these cookies
for the staff,

486
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:50,100
and since you don't
work here anymore...

487
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:51,367
Rude.

488
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,633
But since
I'm such a good brother.

489
00:17:54,767 --> 00:17:55,700
Thank you.

490
00:17:55,834 --> 00:17:56,834
I will be at City Hall
if anyone needs me.

491
00:17:56,967 --> 00:17:57,767
Hey, what's there?

492
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,133
Anything I should know about?

493
00:17:59,266 --> 00:18:00,066
No.

494
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,166
Just Naomi and I

495
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,133
setting up
the time capsule display.

496
00:18:03,266 --> 00:18:04,066
Hey!

497
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,166
For Naomi.

498
00:18:06,834 --> 00:18:08,533
Prepping for dinner already?

499
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:11,734
No, I thought we'd test a dish
for the "Taste of Christmas."

500
00:18:11,867 --> 00:18:13,066
Pork loin?

501
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,600
Bacon-wrapped pork loin
with cherries.

502
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,967
I can smell Christmas already.

503
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,233
So? How is it?

504
00:18:23,367 --> 00:18:24,767
Try it out.

505
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:30,233
It's not bad.

506
00:18:30,367 --> 00:18:32,000
Mm, not bad,

507
00:18:32,133 --> 00:18:33,600
but it's nothing special,

508
00:18:33,734 --> 00:18:35,266
and I need this to be special

509
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,367
if I'm going to beat
The Fairfield Cookery.

510
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,834
Maybe we need to think
outside the box.

511
00:18:40,967 --> 00:18:43,233
My box, but not yours.

512
00:18:43,367 --> 00:18:44,700
What do you mean?

513
00:18:44,834 --> 00:18:47,033
I mean, maybe
I should step it up

514
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,100
and let my talented nephew

515
00:18:49,233 --> 00:18:52,567
teach me a thing or two
about nouvelle cuisine,

516
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,200
I mean, it's your specialty
after all.

517
00:18:56,767 --> 00:18:57,900
All right.

518
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,367
Thank you.

519
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,433
Ooh.

520
00:19:05,567 --> 00:19:08,266
Thinking about
entering the contest?

521
00:19:10,133 --> 00:19:12,433
No, I was just
picking up some pastries,

522
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:14,934
and thought I'd stick around
and check it out.

523
00:19:15,066 --> 00:19:16,233
Hmm, it's not too
old-fashioned for you?

524
00:19:16,367 --> 00:19:18,266
Oh, I haven't had
a good old-fashioned Christmas

525
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,667
in years.

526
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,000
Usually, when I am in town,
it's just for a quick visit.

527
00:19:22,133 --> 00:19:25,333
Well, you seem to have
a lot of time now.

528
00:19:25,467 --> 00:19:26,433
Why not enter?

529
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,433
Is that a challenge?

530
00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:31,834
Well, I've been known to make
a mean gingerbread house

531
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,000
in my day,

532
00:19:33,133 --> 00:19:34,767
but you, sir,
are a professional chef, so...

533
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,300
Well, yes,
a chef, not a baker.

534
00:19:37,433 --> 00:19:38,467
That's two different things.

535
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,133
I guess that does
level the playing field

536
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:41,000
a little bit.

537
00:19:41,133 --> 00:19:42,900
Mm, I'd say.

538
00:19:43,033 --> 00:19:45,300
All right, you're on.

539
00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:46,667
Let's see what you got,
Mr. Chef.

540
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,600
Set it up.

541
00:20:14,066 --> 00:20:17,667
That's what you call
giving it a shot?

542
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,934
Well, it's not
without its flaws,

543
00:20:19,066 --> 00:20:20,166
but I'm happy
with the way it turned out

544
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,934
given the time constraints.

545
00:20:22,066 --> 00:20:24,133
I used to decorate cakes
in culinary school.

546
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:26,767
I guess it paid off.

547
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,400
Well, you are certainly
full of surprises.

548
00:20:29,533 --> 00:20:31,100
Wait till you really
get to know me.

549
00:20:31,233 --> 00:20:33,734
Do you think
that's likely to happen?

550
00:20:33,867 --> 00:20:36,734
I'd say the odds
are in our favor.

551
00:20:37,867 --> 00:20:39,133
What are you going to do
with yours?

552
00:20:39,266 --> 00:20:40,166
I don't know.

553
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,433
Maybe--

554
00:20:41,567 --> 00:20:45,400
Well, I guess that answers
that question.

555
00:20:59,767 --> 00:21:01,100
Come in!

556
00:21:03,934 --> 00:21:05,066
I was on my way to the paper,

557
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,467
but I thought I'd swing by
and drop these off for you.

558
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,133
I figured you might need
all this.

559
00:21:10,266 --> 00:21:11,133
Thanks, Mom.

560
00:21:11,266 --> 00:21:12,834
That's really thoughtful.

561
00:21:12,967 --> 00:21:14,033
Did I interrupt your writing?

562
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,400
I hadn't even
really started yet.

563
00:21:16,533 --> 00:21:18,467
Well, it doesn't look like
you're making much progress

564
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,834
with the packing.

565
00:21:19,967 --> 00:21:21,367
I know,

566
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,667
but it's just so hard
to decide what to take

567
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,367
and what to leave behind.

568
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,734
The apartment is small,

569
00:21:26,867 --> 00:21:28,033
and even though

570
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,967
Stacy is giving me
half of the bookshelves,

571
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,166
it's not nearly enough space
for all my books.

572
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,500
You can store whatever you need
at the house.

573
00:21:34,633 --> 00:21:35,567
Thanks, Mom.

574
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,900
Hey, Henry!

575
00:21:37,033 --> 00:21:38,266
Hey, Lou.

576
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,233
Hey, do you need some help?

577
00:21:48,367 --> 00:21:50,333
I thought I had it,
but I guess not.

578
00:21:50,467 --> 00:21:52,100
-Kyle?
-Is that you?

579
00:21:53,367 --> 00:21:55,800
Didn't I tell you
the odds were in our favor?

580
00:21:55,934 --> 00:21:58,000
How are you handling
this tree?

581
00:21:58,133 --> 00:22:01,233
Yeah, Marcy asked me to get
the biggest tree I could find,

582
00:22:01,367 --> 00:22:03,266
but I think this one's too big.

583
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,133
Well, I think you got it now.

584
00:22:05,266 --> 00:22:06,133
Henry?

585
00:22:06,266 --> 00:22:07,100
We'll hold
these two trees, please?

586
00:22:07,233 --> 00:22:09,033
This one and... that one.

587
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:10,633
You got it, Lou!

588
00:22:10,767 --> 00:22:11,867
-I'll take that for you.
-Hey, thanks.

589
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,834
Yeah.

590
00:22:12,967 --> 00:22:14,734
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

591
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:16,633
Oh, yes! Kelly's is open.

592
00:22:16,767 --> 00:22:17,734
What's that?

593
00:22:17,867 --> 00:22:19,033
What?

594
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:21,467
You haven't had Kelly's famous
Christmas treats before?

595
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,433
Can't say I have.

596
00:22:22,567 --> 00:22:23,533
Ah! Okay.

597
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:25,133
So Kelly's is only here
in Pine Grove,

598
00:22:25,266 --> 00:22:27,233
and their peppermint bark
is one of a kind.

599
00:22:27,367 --> 00:22:28,233
You can only get it

600
00:22:28,367 --> 00:22:29,800
in the weeks
leading up to Christmas.

601
00:22:29,934 --> 00:22:31,467
Hey, I've had
Christmas treats before.

602
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,467
Yeah, but not like these
you haven't.

603
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,467
Come on.

604
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,967
Are you ready to admit
I was right?

605
00:22:37,066 --> 00:22:37,967
That's pretty good.

606
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,300
Oh, come on!

607
00:22:39,433 --> 00:22:41,266
This is like peppermint
and chocolate from heaven.

608
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,800
Kelly grows the peppermint
himself,

609
00:22:43,934 --> 00:22:46,734
and he actually
makes the chocolate by hand.

610
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:50,066
I did an article about him
for the paper.

611
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,200
This is the perfect spot
for a shop.

612
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:55,967
I could even see
opening up a restaurant here.

613
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,233
Is that the fork in the road

614
00:22:57,367 --> 00:22:59,133
you were talking about
the other day?

615
00:23:00,934 --> 00:23:02,533
Mm-hmm.

616
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:04,800
The question is...

617
00:23:04,934 --> 00:23:06,967
do I take the chance
to go out on my own,

618
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,000
open my own place,

619
00:23:09,133 --> 00:23:12,867
or do I just continue on
down the path that I've been on?

620
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,800
Which is what?

621
00:23:15,934 --> 00:23:18,533
Working for other people.

622
00:23:18,667 --> 00:23:19,800
I've had some good bosses,

623
00:23:19,934 --> 00:23:22,533
but at my last place,

624
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:23,767
just mismanaged the place.

625
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,033
He didn't have...

626
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:27,333
He didn't really care
about the food

627
00:23:27,467 --> 00:23:29,166
that came in and out
of that kitchen.

628
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,600
It was an investment for him,

629
00:23:30,734 --> 00:23:32,000
but for me,

630
00:23:32,133 --> 00:23:34,834
being a chef and cooking,

631
00:23:34,967 --> 00:23:36,066
it's a passion...

632
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,867
You know, it's like...

633
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,800
being in love.

634
00:23:39,934 --> 00:23:42,800
I'd like to feel that way
about my writing again,

635
00:23:42,934 --> 00:23:44,800
finish the novel I started.

636
00:23:44,934 --> 00:23:47,100
Is that why you're moving?

637
00:23:47,233 --> 00:23:50,033
I want to make my own mark
as a Webb.

638
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:51,800
And the only way to do that
is to move?

639
00:23:51,934 --> 00:23:53,700
For me it is.

640
00:23:53,834 --> 00:23:56,700
Why is that?

641
00:23:56,834 --> 00:23:58,100
I come from a long line

642
00:23:58,233 --> 00:24:00,734
of incredibly
accomplished people,

643
00:24:00,867 --> 00:24:01,867
and in New York,

644
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,166
I won't have anyone
or anything to prove

645
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,667
except to myself.

646
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,834
But why New York?

647
00:24:07,967 --> 00:24:09,600
I have a few friends there,

648
00:24:09,734 --> 00:24:12,000
and since it is the publishing
capital of the world,

649
00:24:12,133 --> 00:24:14,233
I thought it might be inspiring.

650
00:24:14,367 --> 00:24:15,734
Okay.

651
00:24:15,867 --> 00:24:16,767
That makes sense.

652
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,066
I promised myself

653
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,900
that I would get
at least two chapters done

654
00:24:20,033 --> 00:24:21,033
before I go.

655
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:24,100
Well, sounds like
you've got it all figured out.

656
00:24:24,233 --> 00:24:26,500
Eight years in the making.

657
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:28,767
Don't get me wrong,

658
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,233
but it seems like

659
00:24:30,367 --> 00:24:31,767
you're falling in love
with the romance

660
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,734
of a new beginning

661
00:24:33,867 --> 00:24:36,066
in a new place.

662
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,667
What's wrong with that?

663
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,400
Nothing.

664
00:24:39,533 --> 00:24:41,200
Inspiration comes to people

665
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:42,934
in all different kinds of ways.

666
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:44,033
Hmm.

667
00:24:50,367 --> 00:24:52,000
You did good, Kyle.

668
00:24:52,133 --> 00:24:53,734
Oh, thank you, Lou, for helping.

669
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,734
This is definitely
the biggest tree we've ever had.

670
00:24:55,867 --> 00:24:58,233
I'll get some refreshments.

671
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:03,567
She's great, isn't she?

672
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,266
Marcy? Yeah.

673
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,934
She's always been generous
with her time.

674
00:25:07,066 --> 00:25:08,533
You know,

675
00:25:08,667 --> 00:25:09,767
it's because of her

676
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,600
that I started writing
for myself.

677
00:25:12,734 --> 00:25:13,500
How did that happen?

678
00:25:14,867 --> 00:25:17,300
I was always a really big reader
as a kid,

679
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:19,934
and once, in choir,

680
00:25:20,066 --> 00:25:21,400
she was trying
to get my attention,

681
00:25:21,533 --> 00:25:22,734
and she couldn't

682
00:25:22,867 --> 00:25:25,433
because I was so into
the book that I was reading.

683
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:27,433
Marcy suggested

684
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:30,900
that if I loved
reading fiction so much,

685
00:25:31,033 --> 00:25:31,900
why not write it?

686
00:25:32,033 --> 00:25:33,233
You never
considered it before?

687
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:34,667
No.

688
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,800
It took a little bit
for the idea to sink in.

689
00:25:37,934 --> 00:25:39,333
Yeah, she's always had a knack

690
00:25:39,467 --> 00:25:41,734
for bringing out
people's passion.

691
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:44,333
She's the reason I'm a chef.

692
00:25:48,233 --> 00:25:50,266
We really owe her a lot,
don't we?

693
00:25:51,934 --> 00:25:54,500
Yeah, I guess we do.

694
00:25:56,834 --> 00:25:58,567
This tree needs more lights.

695
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,333
Right.

696
00:26:27,533 --> 00:26:30,533
That is the best tree
the Tavern's ever had.

697
00:26:30,667 --> 00:26:31,533
Thank you.

698
00:26:31,667 --> 00:26:32,667
You want to stay
for dinner?

699
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,700
On the house.

700
00:26:33,834 --> 00:26:35,533
Oh, your food
is always so tempting,

701
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:36,633
but I really should get going.

702
00:26:36,767 --> 00:26:38,600
You got big plans
or something?

703
00:26:38,734 --> 00:26:40,133
No, I'm just
rehearsing with Jeralyn

704
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:41,367
for the Christmas Show.

705
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,700
Rain check then.

706
00:26:43,834 --> 00:26:46,166
-Oh, excuse me.

707
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,600
Oh, I need to take this.

708
00:26:47,734 --> 00:26:50,133
Seems we've got a problem
with our linen delivery.

709
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,834
Hey, thanks again
for your help.

710
00:26:54,967 --> 00:26:56,367
There's no way
this tree looks this good

711
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,633
without your expertise.

712
00:26:57,767 --> 00:26:59,533
Hmm, I'll toast to that,

713
00:26:59,667 --> 00:27:00,667
and you're right, it wouldn't.

714
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,233
But if writing doesn't pan out,

715
00:27:03,367 --> 00:27:05,367
I can always get a job
decorating Christmas windows

716
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,500
on Fifth Ave.

717
00:27:06,633 --> 00:27:08,233
I don't think you're
gonna have that problem.

718
00:27:08,367 --> 00:27:09,934
What makes you say that?

719
00:27:10,066 --> 00:27:11,667
Call it a hunch.

720
00:27:13,367 --> 00:27:14,233
Hey, what's your book
about anyway?

721
00:27:14,367 --> 00:27:15,567
It's a love story

722
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,600
set back
in the Spanish Civil War.

723
00:27:17,734 --> 00:27:19,633
I was a history minor
in college.

724
00:27:19,767 --> 00:27:21,133
Hemingway fan?

725
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:22,400
You've read
"The Sun Also Rises"?

726
00:27:22,533 --> 00:27:23,433
Mm-hmm.

727
00:27:23,567 --> 00:27:24,934
After culinary school,

728
00:27:25,066 --> 00:27:27,367
I spent a year in Spain,
traveling all over.

729
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,600
That sounds amazing.

730
00:27:28,734 --> 00:27:30,467
Yeah, it was.

731
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,900
Incredible.

732
00:27:32,033 --> 00:27:34,400
I learned 19 different ways
to make tapas.

733
00:27:34,533 --> 00:27:36,066
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

734
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,367
You'll have to tell me
about that later.

735
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,934
Sorry to leave you
with a mess, but I gotta go.

736
00:27:40,066 --> 00:27:41,633
No, I got it.
It's fine.

737
00:27:41,767 --> 00:27:43,000
Bye.

738
00:27:44,066 --> 00:27:44,934
Tapas.

739
00:27:50,033 --> 00:27:53,233
Jeralyn, I love this ornament.

740
00:27:53,367 --> 00:27:54,166
Thank you.

741
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,500
You're welcome,

742
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:59,033
but I thought you weren't
going to get a tree this year.

743
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:02,033
I wasn't, I know,

744
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:04,934
but it's just not Christmas
without one.

745
00:28:05,066 --> 00:28:07,367
Or without you singing
the Christmas solo.

746
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,333
I don't know
what I was thinking

747
00:28:08,467 --> 00:28:09,800
when I said
I'd take over for you.

748
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,300
Jeralyn, you have
a beautiful voice.

749
00:28:13,433 --> 00:28:15,367
But I've never sung a solo

750
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,734
in front of
the whole town before,

751
00:28:16,867 --> 00:28:19,967
and making my debut
at the Christmas Show is...

752
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,600
...it's a bit overwhelming.

753
00:28:21,734 --> 00:28:23,667
I totally get that,

754
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,300
but Marcy
wouldn't have chosen you

755
00:28:25,433 --> 00:28:26,533
if she didn't think
you could do it.

756
00:28:26,667 --> 00:28:27,800
Maybe...

757
00:28:27,934 --> 00:28:29,667
but I've got big shoes to fill.

758
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,000
Oh, yeah, you do.

759
00:28:31,133 --> 00:28:31,934
Um, size 11!

760
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,934
Okay, but you are practically
a legend in Pine Grove.

761
00:28:36,066 --> 00:28:37,133
Hardly.

762
00:28:37,266 --> 00:28:41,333
Great-grandpa Louis--
he's a real legend.

763
00:28:41,467 --> 00:28:43,467
I started reading through
his journal,

764
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,467
and even though his name
is all over this town,

765
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,500
it's amazing
how much self-doubt he had

766
00:28:48,633 --> 00:28:49,667
at such a young age.

767
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,100
Speaking of self-doubt,

768
00:28:52,233 --> 00:28:53,934
we better start rehearsing.

769
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:55,367
I need all the help I can get.

770
00:28:57,233 --> 00:28:58,467
Whoo, hold on, I gotcha girl.

771
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,700
Come on, Mama.

772
00:28:59,834 --> 00:29:00,867
Come on.

773
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,033
-Thank you.

774
00:29:03,166 --> 00:29:04,166
Of course.

775
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,867
At least I've got
a great coach.

776
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,500
You are talking
about me, right?

777
00:29:07,633 --> 00:29:10,166
Okay, okay, don't answer that.

778
00:29:13,166 --> 00:29:14,433
You ready to start?

779
00:29:14,567 --> 00:29:16,200
As ready as I'll ever be.

780
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:18,100
Okay, let's do it
like Marcy taught us,

781
00:29:18,233 --> 00:29:18,934
and warm up.

782
00:29:19,066 --> 00:29:19,834
Okay?

783
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,633
I don't even know
why you're worried, girl.

784
00:29:42,767 --> 00:29:44,033
Come on, you sound amazing!

785
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,700
No such thing
as too many lights,

786
00:29:49,834 --> 00:29:50,734
huh, Dad?

787
00:29:50,867 --> 00:29:52,033
Now, who in the world
taught you that?

788
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,266
Oh, I don't know.

789
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,900
It's only something
I've heard you say

790
00:29:56,033 --> 00:29:57,667
every Christmas
since I can remember.

791
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,734
Mm-hmm.

792
00:29:58,867 --> 00:29:59,734
I'll be in the garage
if you need me.

793
00:29:59,867 --> 00:30:01,033
All right.

794
00:30:52,233 --> 00:30:53,266
Hi.

795
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,266
Oh, hey, Dad.

796
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,266
How's it going?

797
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,400
Finding enough room?

798
00:30:56,533 --> 00:30:58,066
I actually found

799
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,967
a bunch of Great-grandpa Louis's
letters and stuff.

800
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,633
You find anything interesting?

801
00:31:02,767 --> 00:31:04,400
Not especially.

802
00:31:04,533 --> 00:31:05,467
Um, oh, the journal

803
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,166
that we pulled
from the Time Capsule

804
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,467
is turning out to be
a real page-turner.

805
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,734
Really?

806
00:31:09,867 --> 00:31:11,767
Mm-hmm, seems that
the stories you heard were true.

807
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,533
He really did turn down a job

808
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:14,867
writing for
The San Francisco Ledger.

809
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Did he say why?

810
00:31:16,133 --> 00:31:17,133
Not so far,

811
00:31:17,266 --> 00:31:19,233
but he did mention
the time capsule a lot,

812
00:31:19,367 --> 00:31:22,266
and no mention of why he put
the beacon in there.

813
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,800
Which proves
it was just a joke.

814
00:31:23,934 --> 00:31:25,100
Maybe.

815
00:31:25,233 --> 00:31:27,400
Did he say anything else
about the time capsule?

816
00:31:27,533 --> 00:31:29,667
Turns out
that he was frustrated

817
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,600
with his fellow
committee members

818
00:31:31,734 --> 00:31:33,567
because they couldn't decide
what to put in it.

819
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:36,000
Well, let's hope
history doesn't repeat itself.

820
00:31:36,133 --> 00:31:37,400
Yeah.

821
00:31:45,934 --> 00:31:48,000
Are you sure
I can't fix you something

822
00:31:48,133 --> 00:31:49,100
before you leave?

823
00:31:49,233 --> 00:31:50,266
Thanks,

824
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,166
but your tea and cookies
were good enough, Mom.

825
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,000
Well, thanks for
stopping by, sweetie.

826
00:31:54,133 --> 00:31:55,400
-Love you.
-Love you, too.

827
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,633
Uh.... Dad,

828
00:31:59,767 --> 00:32:01,867
there's been something
I've been wondering for a while,

829
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,233
and after going through
Grandpa Louis's letters

830
00:32:05,367 --> 00:32:06,533
and stuff in the trunk,

831
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:09,400
it just felt like
the right time to bring it up.

832
00:32:09,533 --> 00:32:11,133
You know you can always
talk to me about anything.

833
00:32:11,266 --> 00:32:12,567
Are you disappointed

834
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,100
that I don't want to stay
with the paper?

835
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,233
I know sometimes
it can be hard

836
00:32:19,367 --> 00:32:20,667
to live up
to the family legacy,

837
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,500
but I understand your decision.

838
00:32:23,633 --> 00:32:26,333
My dad was Mayor of Pine Grove,

839
00:32:26,467 --> 00:32:27,633
I didn't follow
in his footsteps.

840
00:32:27,767 --> 00:32:29,734
But I mean,
you stayed with the paper,

841
00:32:29,867 --> 00:32:31,066
and you became publisher
after him.

842
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,400
Because it's what I wanted,

843
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:33,533
and what I loved.

844
00:32:33,667 --> 00:32:35,633
It's not
that I don't love the paper.

845
00:32:35,767 --> 00:32:36,767
I do, all of it.

846
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:37,900
I know, I know...

847
00:32:38,033 --> 00:32:40,867
and all your mother and I want

848
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,266
is for you to find
what makes you happy.

849
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:44,233
I think I'm on the right path.

850
00:32:44,367 --> 00:32:45,767
Then there's your answer.

851
00:32:46,834 --> 00:32:47,900
I know moving to New York

852
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:51,500
has been a big goal of yours
for a long time...

853
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:59,266
but I think I'm the one
who's had trouble letting go.

854
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,800
How many fathers get to work
with their daughters

855
00:33:01,934 --> 00:33:04,734
so closely, for so long.

856
00:33:04,867 --> 00:33:06,200
I'll miss that.

857
00:33:09,066 --> 00:33:12,433
Now it's your time,

858
00:33:12,567 --> 00:33:15,600
and seeing the determination
in you every day,

859
00:33:15,734 --> 00:33:17,867
I know you'll do well
in New York.

860
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,700
This is for you.

861
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,367
Dad, I can't...

862
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,300
It's just a little something
to help you out along the way.

863
00:33:30,433 --> 00:33:31,800
Thank you.

864
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,767
I could never be disappointed
in you, Lou.

865
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,700
Now, go find yourself.

866
00:33:43,834 --> 00:33:45,266
That's important
for us Webbs to do.

867
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:48,800
-Bye, Dad.
-Bye.

868
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,500
Now, the main difference
between nouvelle cuisine

869
00:34:00,633 --> 00:34:02,567
and traditional cooking

870
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,166
is presentation,

871
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,667
and the combination of flavors
all in one dish.

872
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,567
So I came up with
a Lobster Ravioli

873
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,266
with ivory-white chestnuts,

874
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,433
scented with butter and thyme,

875
00:34:14,567 --> 00:34:16,600
over a bed of purple carrots,

876
00:34:16,734 --> 00:34:19,133
radishes, and beets.

877
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:20,266
What do you think?

878
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,433
I like it.

879
00:34:21,567 --> 00:34:24,266
Not too far out of the box,
but just far enough.

880
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,300
Yeah, that's what
I was going for.

881
00:34:26,867 --> 00:34:28,633
-Let's get to it!
-All right.

882
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:04,033
Where's the rest of it?

883
00:35:04,166 --> 00:35:08,033
Nouvelle is also about
small plates.

884
00:35:08,166 --> 00:35:09,667
Small plates I get,

885
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,266
but this portion
is awfully small.

886
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,000
Go ahead and try it.

887
00:35:14,133 --> 00:35:15,600
The presentation
is just so pretty, I...

888
00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:18,333
Ah, okay.

889
00:35:30,033 --> 00:35:31,066
Excellent.

890
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:34,500
But?

891
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,400
There are just
a lot of flavors going on.

892
00:35:36,533 --> 00:35:38,500
That's the whole point
of nouvelle cuisine.

893
00:35:38,633 --> 00:35:39,533
That may be,

894
00:35:39,667 --> 00:35:42,934
but what I'm not tasting
is Christmas.

895
00:35:45,767 --> 00:35:47,734
We have two more days.

896
00:35:47,867 --> 00:35:49,767
And more cookbooks
to go through.

897
00:35:50,667 --> 00:35:51,567
Hear me out.

898
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,567
It won the drama award
for this year.

899
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,133
-The year that the--
-No offense, Mayor,

900
00:35:56,266 --> 00:35:57,667
but I don't think
your nephew's Christmas play

901
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,400
should go in the time capsule!

902
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:01,333
But it's a wonderful depiction

903
00:36:01,467 --> 00:36:04,367
of Pine Grove in 2021.

904
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,567
It's the next "Our Town".

905
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,467
With all due respect,
I saw the play,

906
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,767
and your nephew
is no Thornton Wilder.

907
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,367
How about we put a pin in this?

908
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,967
We're still getting submissions
every day,

909
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,300
and we have a week
until Christmas Eve,

910
00:36:17,433 --> 00:36:19,166
so there's still
plenty of time to debate.

911
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,100
Let's talk about the ceremony.

912
00:36:22,233 --> 00:36:23,100
Lou, you want to fill us in?

913
00:36:23,233 --> 00:36:24,533
Yes.

914
00:36:24,667 --> 00:36:26,600
So, Santa will be making
an appearance,

915
00:36:26,734 --> 00:36:28,066
and passing out toys
for the toy drive,

916
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,233
and then Jeralyn will be
singing a solo.

917
00:36:31,367 --> 00:36:32,633
I think that covers our agenda.

918
00:36:32,767 --> 00:36:34,900
We'll meet again on Saturday
to go over our final choices.

919
00:36:35,033 --> 00:36:36,133
Want to grab dinner?

920
00:36:36,266 --> 00:36:38,367
I would, but I have to go
back to the office

921
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,700
and clean out my desk.

922
00:36:39,834 --> 00:36:41,734
I could come along and help.

923
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:43,100
Oh, I would love that,

924
00:36:43,233 --> 00:36:44,700
but then
we'd be talking all night,

925
00:36:44,834 --> 00:36:47,934
and I have eight years
of memories to go through.

926
00:36:48,066 --> 00:36:49,367
I don't mind going down
memory lane.

927
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,700
I know, but...

928
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:52,967
you know that we'd get
all sentimental and weepy,

929
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,133
and I wouldn't get
anything done.

930
00:36:55,266 --> 00:36:56,233
Good point.

931
00:36:56,367 --> 00:36:57,600
Hey, does your dad
still have that thing

932
00:36:57,734 --> 00:36:58,600
from the time capsule

933
00:36:58,734 --> 00:36:59,700
in the window at the newspaper?

934
00:36:59,834 --> 00:37:02,033
Hmm, the beacon, yeah.

935
00:37:02,166 --> 00:37:03,200
He put it there

936
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:04,367
just in case Santa
ever needs to find his way

937
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,500
back to Pine Grove.

938
00:37:05,633 --> 00:37:06,767
Or maybe he put it there

939
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,467
for someone to find
her way back.

940
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,667
Trust me,
I don't need a beacon.

941
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,166
Marcy?

942
00:37:43,834 --> 00:37:45,133
Hey, Marcy!

943
00:37:45,266 --> 00:37:47,533
You guys open for take-out?

944
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:49,033
Hey.

945
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,000
Marcy already left.

946
00:37:52,133 --> 00:37:53,500
We closed a bit early tonight.

947
00:37:53,633 --> 00:37:55,367
Oh, okay.

948
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,533
Well, have a good night.

949
00:37:56,667 --> 00:37:58,667
No... you don't have to leave.

950
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,600
What were you going to order?
I'll make it for you.

951
00:38:00,734 --> 00:38:03,066
I don't know,

952
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,033
maybe a sandwich?

953
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:06,200
A sandwich...

954
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:08,333
Come on in, sit down.

955
00:38:08,467 --> 00:38:10,834
I'll cook you something
better than a sandwich.

956
00:38:10,967 --> 00:38:11,967
What's wrong
with a sandwich?

957
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,700
I hope you like lobster.

958
00:38:19,867 --> 00:38:20,767
Wow...

959
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:24,133
I was not expecting
something so fancy.

960
00:38:25,433 --> 00:38:26,934
You look nice.

961
00:38:27,066 --> 00:38:28,533
Thank you. You too.

962
00:38:41,967 --> 00:38:44,567
That is so delicious.

963
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,533
Mm.

964
00:38:46,667 --> 00:38:47,867
Good.

965
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,934
Marcy and I made that today.

966
00:38:50,066 --> 00:38:53,200
We were working on some recipes
for "The Taste of Christmas".

967
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:56,600
This one didn't make the cut.

968
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:58,767
Not Christmassy enough?

969
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,967
That's exactly what she said.

970
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:05,166
You don't agree?

971
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,967
Well, she also mentioned

972
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:10,734
there were too many flavors
going on.

973
00:39:10,867 --> 00:39:12,600
I'm no food critic,

974
00:39:12,734 --> 00:39:14,600
and it is so good.

975
00:39:14,734 --> 00:39:16,200
It does seem
a little bit elaborate

976
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:17,734
compared to
what Marcy's known for.

977
00:39:17,867 --> 00:39:19,367
That was kind of
what we were going for.

978
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,567
We thought maybe if we went
more nouvelle cuisine,

979
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,133
it would increase
her chances of winning.

980
00:39:23,266 --> 00:39:25,967
We all know
how much she wants that.

981
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:29,633
If I can help her get it,
it would mean so much.

982
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:31,133
I mean, she taught me to cook.

983
00:39:31,266 --> 00:39:33,567
No wonder
you're so comfortable here

984
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,266
in the restaurant.

985
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,066
Yeah, this kitchen is
the first place I ever cooked.

986
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,667
I was 11 years old.

987
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,100
I thought you didn't grow up
here in Pine Grove.

988
00:39:42,233 --> 00:39:43,800
No, I didn't,

989
00:39:43,934 --> 00:39:44,967
but my parents and I,

990
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,800
we'd try to come back
every year for Christmas,

991
00:39:46,934 --> 00:39:48,667
and back when
my grandparents were here,

992
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,967
on one visit,

993
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,433
Marcy offered to watch me
for a few hours,

994
00:39:52,567 --> 00:39:54,100
so she brought me
to the kitchen,

995
00:39:54,233 --> 00:39:55,433
and put me to work,

996
00:39:55,567 --> 00:39:57,233
and even though
I was just peeling potatoes,

997
00:39:57,367 --> 00:39:59,433
I remember watching her
and thinking,

998
00:39:59,567 --> 00:40:01,600
"I want to be a chef
when I grow up."

999
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:05,266
That's beautiful.

1000
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,600
I'm sure Marcy is thrilled

1001
00:40:07,734 --> 00:40:09,333
to have someone follow
in her footsteps.

1002
00:40:10,633 --> 00:40:12,133
Yeah, she is,

1003
00:40:12,266 --> 00:40:13,300
but I'm sure you can tell,

1004
00:40:13,433 --> 00:40:16,500
our cooking styles
are different.

1005
00:40:16,633 --> 00:40:18,433
I feel like
I can appreciate her style

1006
00:40:18,567 --> 00:40:20,700
more than she appreciates mine.

1007
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,000
Well, if this ravioli

1008
00:40:23,133 --> 00:40:24,734
is any indication
of what you can do,

1009
00:40:24,867 --> 00:40:26,567
I'm sure you'll have
your own spot one day.

1010
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,567
Yeah, maybe.

1011
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,100
I'm still
at that fork in the road,

1012
00:40:30,233 --> 00:40:31,567
but I'll deal with that
after the holidays.

1013
00:40:33,433 --> 00:40:35,233
You know...

1014
00:40:35,367 --> 00:40:38,834
I bet Marcy wins this year
with you on her team.

1015
00:40:38,967 --> 00:40:40,400
You think so?

1016
00:40:40,533 --> 00:40:42,166
Mm-hmm.

1017
00:40:46,467 --> 00:40:47,567
I'll get us more wine.

1018
00:41:02,066 --> 00:41:03,967
This is it.

1019
00:41:06,533 --> 00:41:07,967
I think...

1020
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:12,133
I just found
the winning recipe.

1021
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,166
That's a great idea.

1022
00:41:23,433 --> 00:41:26,066
My great-grandmother's
old Christmas recipe?

1023
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,300
You don't think
that's too old-fashioned?

1024
00:41:28,433 --> 00:41:29,333
Not if it's done right,

1025
00:41:29,467 --> 00:41:32,600
maybe with a contemporary
twist or two.

1026
00:41:36,967 --> 00:41:39,600
No, something's
not working with this one.

1027
00:41:39,734 --> 00:41:41,100
Maybe too much coriander.

1028
00:41:43,633 --> 00:41:45,400
I'd say too much cumin.

1029
00:41:45,533 --> 00:41:46,800
Mine's not much better.

1030
00:41:46,934 --> 00:41:48,433
Should we start over again,

1031
00:41:48,567 --> 00:41:51,266
and use a pinch of saffron
instead of cumin?

1032
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,000
I say we take a step back,

1033
00:41:53,133 --> 00:41:54,133
clear our heads.

1034
00:41:54,266 --> 00:41:55,600
How about a walk,
get some fresh air?

1035
00:41:55,734 --> 00:41:57,133
No, you go on.

1036
00:41:57,266 --> 00:41:59,066
I'm going to clean up here.

1037
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,233
That was a long walk.

1038
00:42:14,367 --> 00:42:16,266
I stopped to help
some neighborhood kids

1039
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,467
build a snowman.

1040
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,533
You're still at it?

1041
00:42:18,667 --> 00:42:19,667
I had an idea,

1042
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,767
I wanted to see
if it would work.

1043
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:21,867
And did it?

1044
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
You tell me.

1045
00:42:26,834 --> 00:42:27,867
Oh, now that
tastes like Christmas!

1046
00:42:29,266 --> 00:42:31,333
Mm... but I can't tell
what you've added.

1047
00:42:31,467 --> 00:42:32,533
That's my secret.

1048
00:42:32,667 --> 00:42:33,700
Oh, you're not
going to tell me?

1049
00:42:33,834 --> 00:42:35,133
I'll tell you,

1050
00:42:35,266 --> 00:42:37,233
when you tell me the secret
to your meatloaf.

1051
00:42:39,867 --> 00:42:41,433
Thank you. Please enjoy.

1052
00:42:41,567 --> 00:42:43,266
Thank you.
Please enjoy.

1053
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,066
Kyle, when you take
those samples out,

1054
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,367
make sure you go all around.

1055
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,734
All right, I'm gonna
check out the competition

1056
00:42:47,867 --> 00:42:48,700
while I'm at it.

1057
00:42:48,834 --> 00:42:49,734
Smart.

1058
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:50,834
Who do we have next?

1059
00:42:50,967 --> 00:42:52,867
The Fairfield Cookery.

1060
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,066
Fairfield Cookery...

1061
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,533
Wow, look at this spread.

1062
00:42:56,667 --> 00:42:58,333
It's delicious,

1063
00:42:58,467 --> 00:42:59,300
I can tell,

1064
00:42:59,433 --> 00:43:00,400
but I'll give you a...

1065
00:43:01,734 --> 00:43:04,500
I heard that
I need to taste your stew.

1066
00:43:04,633 --> 00:43:06,266
It's getting rave reviews.

1067
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,000
Well, let's hope
the judges think so, too.

1068
00:43:12,734 --> 00:43:15,100
Mm... Mm.

1069
00:43:15,233 --> 00:43:17,033
Tastes like a winner to me.

1070
00:43:17,166 --> 00:43:18,767
This stew is amazing.

1071
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,934
Absolutely fantastic!

1072
00:43:21,066 --> 00:43:22,834
Thank you.

1073
00:43:25,533 --> 00:43:28,333
Thank you. Please enjoy.

1074
00:43:28,467 --> 00:43:30,800
Thank you.
Please enjoy.

1075
00:43:31,867 --> 00:43:33,400
Mm! Hey!

1076
00:43:33,533 --> 00:43:34,633
I was just at your booth.

1077
00:43:34,767 --> 00:43:35,867
And what do you think?

1078
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,066
The stew is phenomenal.

1079
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,800
You and Marcy came up
with an inspired choice.

1080
00:43:38,934 --> 00:43:39,867
Okay, good.

1081
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,133
Marcy's really anxious
about winning,

1082
00:43:41,266 --> 00:43:43,467
so I'm going to check out
the competition.

1083
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,233
Want to join?

1084
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:49,900
Mm...

1085
00:43:50,033 --> 00:43:52,000
Now I see why Marcy's worried.

1086
00:43:53,266 --> 00:43:56,367
This Fairfield Cookery
is gonna be tough to beat,

1087
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,800
There's a lot
of great chefs here.

1088
00:43:57,934 --> 00:44:00,834
Well, it's not Chicago,
but we hold our own.

1089
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,834
I just wish I was here
more often for Christmas.

1090
00:44:04,967 --> 00:44:06,867
Is there a reason
why you weren't?

1091
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,934
Yeah, I missed
the last two Christmases

1092
00:44:09,066 --> 00:44:13,467
because I was with my ex
and her family.

1093
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,467
I can't imagine not spending
Christmas in Pine Grove.

1094
00:44:19,667 --> 00:44:20,967
Christmas in New York
is phenomenal.

1095
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,734
You're gonna love it.

1096
00:44:22,867 --> 00:44:25,600
But everyone I love is here.

1097
00:44:25,734 --> 00:44:28,166
So you're not leaving
a boyfriend

1098
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:30,000
or anybody special behind?

1099
00:44:30,133 --> 00:44:32,000
Mm-mm. Totally single.

1100
00:44:32,133 --> 00:44:34,800
I find that surprising.

1101
00:44:34,934 --> 00:44:36,333
Thank you,

1102
00:44:36,467 --> 00:44:37,333
and if I do find a guy,

1103
00:44:37,467 --> 00:44:39,834
he's gonna
have to love Christmas.

1104
00:44:39,967 --> 00:44:41,200
Is that a dealbreaker?

1105
00:44:41,333 --> 00:44:43,100
Absolutely.

1106
00:44:43,233 --> 00:44:44,367
What's yours?

1107
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:47,467
Uh, well, she would
have to love my cooking.

1108
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,500
That's too easy.

1109
00:44:49,633 --> 00:44:51,200
You're right.

1110
00:44:51,333 --> 00:44:53,667
Thank you,
I'll take the compliment.

1111
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,166
All right, how about this,

1112
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:57,367
she's gotta have
a great sense of humor,

1113
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:02,166
and laugh at my corny jokes.

1114
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,467
What if she doesn't?

1115
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,500
I never thought about that.

1116
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:12,867
That might be too hard.

1117
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,166
You're laughing.

1118
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,000
I'm gonna go find my friends.

1119
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:20,800
Okay.

1120
00:45:20,934 --> 00:45:23,000
I should get back to the booth.

1121
00:45:23,133 --> 00:45:25,500
I'll be rooting
for you and Marcy.

1122
00:45:25,633 --> 00:45:27,133
Thanks.

1123
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,667
Thank you.
Hope you enjoy!

1124
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,233
Hey, tell your friends
to get on over

1125
00:45:34,367 --> 00:45:35,333
before it's all gone.

1126
00:45:35,467 --> 00:45:37,567
Marcy? Kyle?

1127
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,767
Why don't you take a break
for a second?

1128
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,600
Okay.

1129
00:45:43,667 --> 00:45:45,033
Your booth is doing great.

1130
00:45:45,166 --> 00:45:46,367
Thank you,

1131
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,500
but we're almost finished up,
so you'd better get some.

1132
00:45:48,633 --> 00:45:50,900
Oh, we tried your stew, Marcy.

1133
00:45:51,033 --> 00:45:53,200
Believe me, we all did.

1134
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:54,500
So, what's going on?

1135
00:45:54,633 --> 00:45:55,834
It's our honor

1136
00:45:55,967 --> 00:45:58,900
to award the Pine Grove Tavern

1137
00:45:59,033 --> 00:46:01,233
first place for Best Entree

1138
00:46:01,367 --> 00:46:03,200
in this year's
"Taste of Christmas" contest.

1139
00:46:03,333 --> 00:46:05,066
Hey, congrats, Marcy!

1140
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:05,967
This is so exciting!

1141
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:08,233
I can't believe it!

1142
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:10,433
Thank you.

1143
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:11,467
You did it, Auntie.

1144
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,033
No, we did it.

1145
00:46:13,166 --> 00:46:15,433
Yes, we did, didn't we?

1146
00:46:15,567 --> 00:46:17,233
One more time
for the Pine Grove Tavern!

1147
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,900
Whoo!

1148
00:46:21,033 --> 00:46:22,600
Yeah!

1149
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,500
"I knew
this would be my last Christmas

1150
00:47:04,633 --> 00:47:05,700
in Pine Grove,

1151
00:47:05,834 --> 00:47:06,834
as I'd accepted
the newspaper job

1152
00:47:06,967 --> 00:47:08,233
in San Francisco..."

1153
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,467
"...And it took

1154
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,834
every ounce of my courage

1155
00:47:13,967 --> 00:47:16,433
to ask my beloved Mae
to be my wife

1156
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:17,900
and come with me.

1157
00:47:18,033 --> 00:47:20,400
It shattered my soul
when she turned me down.

1158
00:47:20,533 --> 00:47:22,867
She couldn't bring herself
to leave her family,

1159
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,600
or her new community.

1160
00:47:24,734 --> 00:47:26,867
She had more faith in it
than I did."

1161
00:47:35,066 --> 00:47:36,567
Hey, Auntie.

1162
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:37,600
Hey, Kyle!

1163
00:47:37,734 --> 00:47:38,633
What are you doing here?

1164
00:47:38,767 --> 00:47:40,133
I thought you were
back at the house.

1165
00:47:40,266 --> 00:47:42,100
Getting some last-minute
Christmas shopping done.

1166
00:47:42,233 --> 00:47:43,033
What about you?

1167
00:47:43,166 --> 00:47:44,066
Same.

1168
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,767
Looking for something
for the Webbs.

1169
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,734
I saw these adorable
earrings for Lou.

1170
00:47:47,867 --> 00:47:49,800
I'm just not sure
if they're her style.

1171
00:47:49,934 --> 00:47:51,734
You've been hanging out
with her lately,

1172
00:47:51,867 --> 00:47:52,900
you got any ideas?

1173
00:47:53,033 --> 00:47:54,834
I didn't even know
she had her ears pierced.

1174
00:47:54,967 --> 00:47:56,233
Really?

1175
00:47:56,367 --> 00:47:57,700
These are nice, though.

1176
00:47:59,166 --> 00:47:59,967
Thank you.

1177
00:48:00,166 --> 00:48:01,934
Oh, one second.

1178
00:48:03,066 --> 00:48:04,967
Hello?

1179
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:06,767
Yeah.

1180
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,367
No, yeah, I'm definitely
still available.

1181
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,633
Sure.

1182
00:48:10,767 --> 00:48:11,700
Okay.

1183
00:48:11,834 --> 00:48:14,000
What kind of restaurant is it?

1184
00:48:14,133 --> 00:48:15,800
Okay, great.

1185
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:17,967
Yeah, no, I'd love
to come in for an interview.

1186
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:19,433
I did it.
They're perfect!

1187
00:48:19,567 --> 00:48:20,834
Okay, all right.

1188
00:48:20,967 --> 00:48:22,734
Yeah, I'll see you then.

1189
00:48:22,867 --> 00:48:24,033
Bye-bye.

1190
00:48:24,166 --> 00:48:26,433
Hey. Hi there.
What can I get you?

1191
00:48:26,567 --> 00:48:28,467
Two dozen Christmas Buns,

1192
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,200
and a large coffee, please.

1193
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:32,133
Coming right up.

1194
00:48:32,266 --> 00:48:33,500
Hey, Lou.

1195
00:48:33,633 --> 00:48:34,667
How you doing?

1196
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,200
Hey.

1197
00:48:36,333 --> 00:48:37,834
It was a late night.

1198
00:48:39,133 --> 00:48:41,233
-Here you go.
-That explains the coffee.

1199
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,533
So, what kept you up?

1200
00:48:45,667 --> 00:48:47,166
Writing...

1201
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,500
or attempting to.

1202
00:48:48,633 --> 00:48:50,000
Ah-hah.

1203
00:48:50,133 --> 00:48:51,300
I've heard about this,

1204
00:48:51,433 --> 00:48:52,900
the proverbial writer's block.

1205
00:48:53,033 --> 00:48:56,300
I know you said
inspiration is personal.

1206
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,734
How personal does it have to get
before it kicks in?

1207
00:48:58,867 --> 00:49:01,200
Well, it's different
for everybody.

1208
00:49:01,333 --> 00:49:03,233
When you know, you know.

1209
00:49:03,367 --> 00:49:05,166
What brings you out so early?

1210
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:08,567
I've got to finish
my Christmas shopping.

1211
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:11,700
I still have to get
a gift for my aunt.

1212
00:49:11,834 --> 00:49:13,266
Hey, you think you can
help me out with that?

1213
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,533
I could,

1214
00:49:14,667 --> 00:49:16,500
but I'm actually headed
to a committee meeting.

1215
00:49:16,633 --> 00:49:17,567
I could meet you
in about an hour.

1216
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:18,834
All right, it's a date.

1217
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,066
Thank you.

1218
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,934
Wait, are these
the Christmas Buns

1219
00:49:24,066 --> 00:49:25,033
everybody's talking about?

1220
00:49:25,166 --> 00:49:26,100
Yes, they are,
and you need to try some,

1221
00:49:26,233 --> 00:49:27,600
but not these ones.

1222
00:49:27,734 --> 00:49:29,033
Uh, excuse me,

1223
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:30,433
can I get another one
for my friend, please?

1224
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:31,767
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1225
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:33,734
Let me know what you think
of them later, okay?

1226
00:49:33,867 --> 00:49:35,266
I will.

1227
00:49:37,533 --> 00:49:39,433
Thank you.

1228
00:49:42,066 --> 00:49:43,433
Yeah, I've never been

1229
00:49:43,567 --> 00:49:45,500
the greatest
Christmas gift giver.

1230
00:49:45,633 --> 00:49:47,900
You just need to know
what people like.

1231
00:49:48,033 --> 00:49:49,400
You know, you've got
to pay attention sometimes.

1232
00:49:49,533 --> 00:49:50,533
Right, okay.

1233
00:49:50,667 --> 00:49:51,767
Let's try this table.

1234
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,600
You really think
I should get jewelry

1235
00:49:55,734 --> 00:49:56,767
for my aunt for Christmas?

1236
00:49:58,166 --> 00:50:01,367
Well, haven't you noticed
she always wears a brooch?

1237
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,500
Uh...

1238
00:50:02,633 --> 00:50:03,734
Well, I mean, there's so many.

1239
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:05,367
I don't which one to choose.

1240
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,433
Think about
what Marcy likes to do.

1241
00:50:07,567 --> 00:50:09,567
She likes to cook...

1242
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:11,867
uh... sing,

1243
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,433
boss me around.

1244
00:50:14,567 --> 00:50:16,100
Oh, right there.

1245
00:50:16,233 --> 00:50:17,834
I think she's gonna like
that one.

1246
00:50:17,967 --> 00:50:19,500
Oh, yeah, that's the one.

1247
00:50:19,633 --> 00:50:21,500
He'd like to see
that one, please.

1248
00:50:25,033 --> 00:50:26,567
Thank you.

1249
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,333
Yeah, that's perfect.

1250
00:50:29,467 --> 00:50:30,867
Can you warp this up for me?

1251
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,700
Thank you.

1252
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,433
Looking for a Christmas gift
for someone?

1253
00:50:36,567 --> 00:50:39,033
No.

1254
00:50:39,166 --> 00:50:41,066
I've always loved lockets.

1255
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,600
There's just something
so special

1256
00:50:43,734 --> 00:50:46,700
about putting a picture
of someone you love in there,

1257
00:50:46,834 --> 00:50:49,500
and wearing it
close to your heart.

1258
00:50:49,633 --> 00:50:52,200
I know that sounds cheesy.

1259
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:55,100
No, that's not too cheesy.

1260
00:50:56,166 --> 00:50:57,467
Thank you.

1261
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,266
Thanks.
Merry Christmas.

1262
00:51:00,533 --> 00:51:04,300
Well, uh... thanks again.

1263
00:51:04,433 --> 00:51:06,133
All right, I'm gonna...

1264
00:51:06,266 --> 00:51:08,667
let you enjoy
the rest of your day.

1265
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:10,867
Okay.

1266
00:51:12,367 --> 00:51:13,166
Kyle?

1267
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:14,400
Yeah.

1268
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,467
In case you're interested,

1269
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,700
a few of us are going
to the town square tonight.

1270
00:51:18,834 --> 00:51:20,734
It should be a clear night
to look at stars,

1271
00:51:20,867 --> 00:51:21,767
sit by the fire pit.

1272
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:23,266
Yeah, I--

1273
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,266
Oh.

1274
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,600
Sorry.

1275
00:51:25,734 --> 00:51:27,600
I'm expecting
an important message.

1276
00:51:27,734 --> 00:51:29,367
Good news?

1277
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:31,700
Yeah.

1278
00:51:31,834 --> 00:51:33,500
I've got an interview tomorrow

1279
00:51:33,633 --> 00:51:35,100
at one of the top restaurants
in Chicago.

1280
00:51:35,233 --> 00:51:36,000
That's great!

1281
00:51:36,133 --> 00:51:37,300
Congratulations.

1282
00:51:37,433 --> 00:51:38,500
Thanks,
but I don't have the job yet.

1283
00:51:38,633 --> 00:51:39,667
I have to cook something
for the owner.

1284
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,433
So the question is...

1285
00:51:41,567 --> 00:51:42,967
what do I make?

1286
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,567
Why not show him who you are.

1287
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:46,834
Cook what you love.

1288
00:51:47,967 --> 00:51:49,500
That's good advice.

1289
00:51:49,633 --> 00:51:51,166
Thank you.

1290
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:52,533
Yeah.

1291
00:51:53,867 --> 00:51:55,166
Hey, Lou.

1292
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:57,333
What time tonight?

1293
00:51:57,467 --> 00:52:00,433
I'm planning
to get there at 8:00.

1294
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:02,433
I'll see what I can do.

1295
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:50,000
Looking for something?

1296
00:52:50,133 --> 00:52:51,667
Oh! Naomi...

1297
00:52:53,033 --> 00:52:55,967
No, I mentioned to somebody
that I might be here,

1298
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:57,200
but I don't think he's coming.

1299
00:52:57,333 --> 00:52:58,166
He?

1300
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,300
It's not a big deal.

1301
00:53:00,433 --> 00:53:01,633
Okay, well, you're wearing
your new coat,

1302
00:53:01,767 --> 00:53:04,600
so I'm guessing it is.

1303
00:53:04,734 --> 00:53:05,567
You know I'm gonna find out
sooner or later,

1304
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:07,734
so you might as well tell me.

1305
00:53:07,867 --> 00:53:08,734
Two ciders, please.

1306
00:53:08,867 --> 00:53:11,066
Remember the waiter
from The Tavern?

1307
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,300
The cute one?

1308
00:53:12,433 --> 00:53:13,700
Yes.

1309
00:53:13,834 --> 00:53:16,600
Um, he's actually
Marcy's nephew from Chicago,

1310
00:53:16,734 --> 00:53:18,433
and he's actually
an amazing chef.

1311
00:53:18,567 --> 00:53:19,767
-Are you two dating?
-No.

1312
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:22,066
No, we just ran into each other
a few times, that's all.

1313
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,433
Thank you.

1314
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:24,867
Well, maybe you two are running
into each other for a reason.

1315
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,367
No.

1316
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:27,967
He's from Chicago, and hello,
I'll be in New York.

1317
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:30,100
Okay, you have five more days
till you leave,

1318
00:53:30,233 --> 00:53:30,967
you never know
what could happen.

1319
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:32,967
In this case, I do.

1320
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:34,467
-Okay, maybe the two--
-Not gonna happen.

1321
00:53:36,533 --> 00:53:37,400
Hmm.

1322
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,834
Good luck!

1323
00:53:45,934 --> 00:53:48,367
You're going to love
everything about New York,

1324
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,600
but nothing beats, nothing beats

1325
00:53:50,734 --> 00:53:52,767
a Chicago deep-dish pizza.

1326
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,033
What?

1327
00:53:54,166 --> 00:53:55,967
Everybody knows
that New York pizza is the best.

1328
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:58,834
Everybody's wrong.

1329
00:54:00,667 --> 00:54:02,200
I knew there was a catch.

1330
00:54:02,333 --> 00:54:04,000
I knew
there was a catch.

1331
00:54:05,767 --> 00:54:06,700
Hey, you never forget

1332
00:54:06,834 --> 00:54:09,266
your first meal
in the Big Apple, never.

1333
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,367
It sticks with you forever.

1334
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:12,900
It's like something
you're really passionate--

1335
00:54:13,033 --> 00:54:14,967
Like, do you remember
the first book that you wrote?

1336
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:19,367
I was six
when I wrote my first book.

1337
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:21,600
You were six?

1338
00:54:21,734 --> 00:54:22,700
When you wrote your first book?

1339
00:54:23,967 --> 00:54:27,100
Yes, but, okay,
there was exactly one copy,

1340
00:54:27,233 --> 00:54:30,400
and it was printed on cardstock
from my dad's office.

1341
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:32,133
And did the author
sign the book?

1342
00:54:32,266 --> 00:54:33,433
Oh, with crayon.

1343
00:54:33,567 --> 00:54:34,900
What was it about?

1344
00:54:35,033 --> 00:54:37,834
A little girl
that goes to the North Pole

1345
00:54:37,967 --> 00:54:40,567
to make sure Santa is
giving gifts to the elves.

1346
00:54:41,734 --> 00:54:42,667
And you wrote it yourself?

1347
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,133
Yeah.

1348
00:54:44,266 --> 00:54:47,266
My Dad helped me
with the pictures.

1349
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,633
He took it to the paper

1350
00:54:48,767 --> 00:54:52,000
and got it professionally
printed, bound, everything...

1351
00:54:52,133 --> 00:54:53,767
and, um...

1352
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:54,800
he got it wrapped,

1353
00:54:54,934 --> 00:54:57,166
and I opened it
on Christmas morning,

1354
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:58,433
and I saw,

1355
00:54:58,567 --> 00:55:01,934
"Written by Louise Webb."

1356
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,967
I never forgot that.

1357
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:08,200
Won't be long

1358
00:55:08,333 --> 00:55:10,133
before you see your name
like that again.

1359
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,633
It's frustrating, you know?

1360
00:55:13,767 --> 00:55:15,200
Nothing that I've been
writing lately

1361
00:55:15,333 --> 00:55:16,800
has been sticking.

1362
00:55:16,934 --> 00:55:18,000
I write the words,

1363
00:55:18,133 --> 00:55:21,900
and they just
slide off the page.

1364
00:55:22,033 --> 00:55:23,934
Well, keep going.

1365
00:55:24,066 --> 00:55:26,567
Sooner or later,
something's gonna stick.

1366
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:28,867
Your passion
has taken you this far.

1367
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,867
You'll get it.

1368
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,633
Thank you.

1369
00:55:35,367 --> 00:55:36,266
Hey, you know
what I think is gonna help

1370
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,500
with your writer's block?

1371
00:55:38,633 --> 00:55:40,200
S'mores.

1372
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,867
You chefs think chocolate
solves everything.

1373
00:55:47,166 --> 00:55:48,200
It does.

1374
00:56:01,934 --> 00:56:05,767
This is the last batch.

1375
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:07,467
We get better at this
every single year.

1376
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:08,433
We sure do.

1377
00:56:09,667 --> 00:56:12,000
For me, it's the highlight
of the season.

1378
00:56:12,133 --> 00:56:12,967
Me, too.

1379
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:14,533
Despite all of the work.

1380
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,333
So much of it.

1381
00:56:17,467 --> 00:56:20,867
I was thinking
that I would wear my red dress.

1382
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,133
Oh.

1383
00:56:22,266 --> 00:56:23,867
Would you mind if I borrow
your charm bracelet again?

1384
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,600
Of course not,

1385
00:56:25,734 --> 00:56:27,133
but I think you should keep it.

1386
00:56:28,667 --> 00:56:29,967
Why?

1387
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:32,266
I was going to give it to you
eventually,

1388
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,033
so it might as well be now,

1389
00:56:35,166 --> 00:56:36,533
and it would be nice knowing

1390
00:56:36,667 --> 00:56:38,467
that you'd be taking
a little piece of me with you

1391
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,834
to New York.

1392
00:56:40,967 --> 00:56:42,967
Oh, Mom...

1393
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:44,367
I love you.

1394
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,734
I love you, too.

1395
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:54,100
Hey, Del,

1396
00:56:54,233 --> 00:56:57,033
it's great to finally see
your restaurant.

1397
00:56:57,166 --> 00:56:58,000
Well, I've heard a lot
about you

1398
00:56:58,133 --> 00:56:59,667
from our mutual friend, Michael,

1399
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,333
He's been singing your praises.

1400
00:57:01,467 --> 00:57:03,600
Well, hopefully,
I can live up to it.

1401
00:57:03,734 --> 00:57:05,700
I've prepared
two of my favorite dishes.

1402
00:57:05,834 --> 00:57:06,834
Great.

1403
00:57:06,967 --> 00:57:08,166
Let's give them a go.

1404
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:13,433
Mm.

1405
00:57:13,567 --> 00:57:15,533
This Kanpachi Tartare
is outstanding.

1406
00:57:15,667 --> 00:57:16,934
The flavors are just right.

1407
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:18,100
This is very nice.

1408
00:57:18,233 --> 00:57:19,166
Thank you.

1409
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:20,266
Now, what's this?

1410
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,600
This is
"Christmas Caroler's Stew."

1411
00:57:22,734 --> 00:57:25,700
It's an old family recipe.

1412
00:57:30,633 --> 00:57:32,200
Also very nice,

1413
00:57:32,333 --> 00:57:33,900
but a little too
meat and potatoes

1414
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:34,767
if you know what I mean.

1415
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:36,033
Well, since it's Christmas,

1416
00:57:36,166 --> 00:57:38,000
I thought it might be fun
to have a seasonal dish.

1417
00:57:38,133 --> 00:57:39,333
Fair enough.

1418
00:57:39,467 --> 00:57:41,567
Both of these dishes
certainly showcase your talents.

1419
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:43,533
Why don't you give me
a couple of days

1420
00:57:43,667 --> 00:57:44,834
to get back to you?

1421
00:57:44,967 --> 00:57:46,100
My chef is leaving
right after New Year's,

1422
00:57:46,233 --> 00:57:47,834
and I need to fill
that spot soon.

1423
00:57:47,967 --> 00:57:49,000
Are you available then?

1424
00:57:49,133 --> 00:57:50,467
Yes, absolutely.

1425
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:51,734
That's good to know.

1426
00:57:54,667 --> 00:57:55,767
Sorry we're late.

1427
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:57,767
Kyle just got back from Chicago.

1428
00:57:57,900 --> 00:57:59,233
I had to stay late
at the restaurant to clean up.

1429
00:57:59,367 --> 00:58:00,467
Oh, no worries.

1430
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,834
I'm just really happy
you both could make it.

1431
00:58:02,967 --> 00:58:05,467
That is a lovely pin, Marcy.

1432
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,300
Oh, you know me
and my brooches.

1433
00:58:08,467 --> 00:58:09,567
Who doesn't?

1434
00:58:10,767 --> 00:58:11,767
I see your father,

1435
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:12,900
I'm gonna go say hello.

1436
00:58:13,033 --> 00:58:14,767
Excuse me.

1437
00:58:17,066 --> 00:58:18,834
So, how did things go
in Chicago?

1438
00:58:18,967 --> 00:58:20,633
Pretty good.

1439
00:58:20,767 --> 00:58:21,667
I took your advice.

1440
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:22,967
Which advice was that?

1441
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:24,934
I made something I love,

1442
00:58:25,066 --> 00:58:26,233
and I think the owner
liked it, too.

1443
00:58:26,367 --> 00:58:27,266
but I won't know for sure

1444
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:28,400
until he actually
offers me the job.

1445
00:58:28,533 --> 00:58:30,333
I'll bet he does.

1446
00:58:30,467 --> 00:58:31,667
Yeah?
What makes you say that?

1447
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,633
Call it a hunch.

1448
00:58:33,767 --> 00:58:36,900
Lou, come and say hello
to the Marshalls!

1449
00:58:42,033 --> 00:58:44,266
Mrs. Webb,
this is quite the spread.

1450
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,166
Thank you.

1451
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,000
We go all out every year.

1452
00:58:47,133 --> 00:58:49,734
You mean this party
is a long-lasting tradition?

1453
00:58:49,867 --> 00:58:51,467
It started with
Eli's grandfather, Louis,

1454
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:52,934
in 1925

1455
00:58:53,066 --> 00:58:54,233
when he built this house.

1456
00:58:54,367 --> 00:58:56,000
He didn't have
much family of his own,

1457
00:58:56,133 --> 00:58:59,100
so he invited anyone
who didn't have somewhere to go.

1458
00:58:59,233 --> 00:59:00,734
That way,
no one was on their own.

1459
00:59:00,867 --> 00:59:02,033
Wow.

1460
00:59:02,166 --> 00:59:03,333
That's a lot
of Christmas parties.

1461
00:59:03,467 --> 00:59:05,633
Well, this town
loves its traditions.

1462
00:59:05,767 --> 00:59:07,667
Yeah, I noticed.

1463
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:08,900
You really do have
a beautiful home.

1464
00:59:09,033 --> 00:59:10,467
Thank you.

1465
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,333
It is, isn't it?

1466
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:14,400
Care for a tour?

1467
00:59:14,533 --> 00:59:16,166
Yeah, I'd love one.

1468
00:59:18,367 --> 00:59:19,567
-Excuse us.
-Mm-hmm.

1469
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,500
This is
one of my favorite places.

1470
00:59:23,633 --> 00:59:26,467
I used to come out here,

1471
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:29,667
snuggle up
with a cup of hot cocoa,

1472
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:30,967
watch the snow fall,

1473
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,700
and become inspired.

1474
00:59:33,834 --> 00:59:36,533
I thought you said
Hemingway inspired you.

1475
00:59:36,667 --> 00:59:38,367
Yeah, well, he came after.

1476
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:41,967
After reading him,
and Fitzgerald,

1477
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:43,200
and Dorothy Parker,

1478
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:47,734
the plan was to go to New York
and become a novelist.

1479
00:59:47,867 --> 00:59:49,533
So, what stopped you?

1480
00:59:49,667 --> 00:59:53,400
My parents offered me a job
at the paper,

1481
00:59:53,533 --> 00:59:54,800
and I thought
it would be good experience

1482
00:59:54,934 --> 00:59:56,633
before New York.

1483
00:59:56,767 --> 00:59:58,200
Was it?

1484
00:59:58,333 --> 00:59:59,367
Yeah,

1485
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:02,633
but I didn't think I'd stay
as long as I did,

1486
01:00:02,767 --> 01:00:04,367
and I never could
quite find the time

1487
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,867
to finish my book.

1488
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,734
That sounds like
an excuse to me.

1489
01:00:11,467 --> 01:00:12,834
Hmm...

1490
01:00:13,967 --> 01:00:17,033
I suppose it is.

1491
01:00:17,166 --> 01:00:19,300
I had a big birthday this year,

1492
01:00:19,433 --> 01:00:22,967
and seeing all that my friends
had accomplished,

1493
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:24,700
and I was still
stuck in Pine Grove

1494
01:00:24,834 --> 01:00:25,734
at the same job,

1495
01:00:25,867 --> 01:00:30,000
I... suddenly became terrified

1496
01:00:30,133 --> 01:00:31,834
that I would never
achieve my dreams,

1497
01:00:31,967 --> 01:00:35,133
so I thought, to do that,

1498
01:00:35,266 --> 01:00:36,300
I had to leave.

1499
01:00:38,834 --> 01:00:41,800
Yeah, I get that.

1500
01:00:41,934 --> 01:00:45,500
It's too bad, though,

1501
01:00:45,633 --> 01:00:47,166
It would have been nice

1502
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:50,333
to spend some more Christmases
here with Aunt Marcy.

1503
01:00:50,467 --> 01:00:51,867
What makes you say that?

1504
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,600
'I might have met you
a whole lot sooner.

1505
01:00:58,467 --> 01:01:00,400
Lou, I've been looking for you.

1506
01:01:00,533 --> 01:01:01,300
We need you at the piano.

1507
01:01:01,433 --> 01:01:03,000
Oh, right.
Coming.

1508
01:01:08,767 --> 01:01:10,200
Good evening, everyone.

1509
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:13,000
I'd like to thank you all
for coming tonight.

1510
01:01:13,133 --> 01:01:15,400
I know we all
look forward to this

1511
01:01:15,533 --> 01:01:16,800
year after year.

1512
01:01:16,934 --> 01:01:17,800
Lou...

1513
01:01:17,934 --> 01:01:18,834
take it away.

1514
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:20,700
How come no one ever
asks me to sing?

1515
01:01:20,834 --> 01:01:22,533
Because you sound
like a foghorn.

1516
01:01:22,667 --> 01:01:23,467
Shh...

1517
01:03:24,166 --> 01:03:25,333
Bravo.

1518
01:03:28,133 --> 01:03:29,066
"Pine Grove

1519
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,734
had made me feel
part of something

1520
01:03:30,867 --> 01:03:32,367
for the first time in my life,

1521
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:35,333
and I was deeply in love
with Mae,

1522
01:03:35,467 --> 01:03:37,900
so it was with a heavy heart
that I contemplated leaving.

1523
01:03:38,033 --> 01:03:40,033
I wrestled with this decision
for days,

1524
01:03:40,166 --> 01:03:41,233
but it wasn't until I realized

1525
01:03:41,367 --> 01:03:43,400
exactly what
I'd be leaving behind

1526
01:03:43,533 --> 01:03:45,867
that I had a change of heart.

1527
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,100
My community
had become my family,

1528
01:03:48,233 --> 01:03:50,166
and it dawned on me that--"

1529
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:53,467
"--everyone I loved was here."

1530
01:04:17,934 --> 01:04:19,767
"Every town
is filled with memories,

1531
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:21,934
especially at Christmas.

1532
01:04:22,066 --> 01:04:23,600
No one could have imagined

1533
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:27,734
that something found inside
a 100-year-old time capsule

1534
01:04:27,867 --> 01:04:29,133
would have
such a profound effect

1535
01:04:29,266 --> 01:04:30,767
on a young woman
at a crossroads,

1536
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,000
or that she would utter

1537
01:04:33,133 --> 01:04:35,100
the same words
as her great-grandfather

1538
01:04:35,233 --> 01:04:37,266
whom she had never met--"

1539
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:39,400
"'Everyone I love is here.'

1540
01:04:39,533 --> 01:04:43,700
It was enough to stop her
in her tracks."

1541
01:04:49,033 --> 01:04:50,400
I was thinking
about today's special.

1542
01:04:50,533 --> 01:04:51,633
The Quiche Lorraine?

1543
01:04:51,767 --> 01:04:54,400
Yeah. How do you feel about
changing it up a bit?

1544
01:04:54,533 --> 01:04:56,333
What would you have in mind?

1545
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,967
How about a cranberry tart
with pancetta and thyme?

1546
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:03,266
It's more or less
still a quiche.

1547
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,900
It sounds delicious.
Let's do it.

1548
01:05:10,133 --> 01:05:11,500
"Her great-grandfather insisted

1549
01:05:11,633 --> 01:05:14,100
that he'd only printed the story
to sell more newspapers,

1550
01:05:14,233 --> 01:05:15,367
telling her,

1551
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:17,033
'People want to believe
in miracles at Christmas,

1552
01:05:17,166 --> 01:05:20,033
because that's
when the magic happens.'

1553
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:21,467
But she wondered
if there was more to the story

1554
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:23,100
than he let on.

1555
01:05:23,233 --> 01:05:24,367
For instance,

1556
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,533
why was the beacon
placed in the time capsule?

1557
01:05:26,667 --> 01:05:28,867
And then it dawned on her.

1558
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,367
It wasn't the whimsy
of the Christmas season,

1559
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:33,600
it was his way of telling them

1560
01:05:33,734 --> 01:05:35,700
that he had found
his way home."

1561
01:05:51,133 --> 01:05:53,166
Hey, it's Lou Webb.

1562
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:54,800
Yeah, I'd like to place
a lunch order to go.

1563
01:06:04,233 --> 01:06:05,166
Special of the day,

1564
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:08,700
cranberry tart
with pancetta and thyme.

1565
01:06:08,834 --> 01:06:10,333
Thank you.

1566
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:12,000
You didn't have to do this.

1567
01:06:12,133 --> 01:06:13,500
Well, it's a special delivery.

1568
01:06:13,633 --> 01:06:14,500
Let me know how you like it.

1569
01:06:14,633 --> 01:06:16,500
You have not failed me yet.

1570
01:06:16,633 --> 01:06:19,367
Come inside, come in.

1571
01:06:21,734 --> 01:06:22,934
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

1572
01:06:23,066 --> 01:06:24,433
No, actually,

1573
01:06:24,567 --> 01:06:26,200
I have been writing
all morning.

1574
01:06:26,333 --> 01:06:28,734
How is
the Spanish Civil War going?

1575
01:06:28,867 --> 01:06:30,934
I... I put that aside.

1576
01:06:31,066 --> 01:06:33,033
I actually started
writing something new,

1577
01:06:33,166 --> 01:06:34,567
something I really love,

1578
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:36,300
and everything
just fell into place,

1579
01:06:36,433 --> 01:06:37,867
and I wouldn't have even
stopped writing,

1580
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,767
except I, uh... got hungry.

1581
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:40,767
Well, that's great.

1582
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:41,867
Now you don't have to move.

1583
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Are you kidding?

1584
01:06:43,133 --> 01:06:44,400
I'm even more excited
to get to New York.

1585
01:06:44,533 --> 01:06:46,333
Well then, I'm happy
you had a breakthrough.

1586
01:06:46,467 --> 01:06:47,967
I'm pretty happy
about it myself.

1587
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:49,433
We should celebrate.

1588
01:06:49,567 --> 01:06:53,033
This is my celebration.

1589
01:06:53,166 --> 01:06:54,734
We can do better than that.

1590
01:06:54,867 --> 01:06:55,967
Like what?

1591
01:06:58,500 --> 01:06:59,533
Go out with me.

1592
01:07:02,433 --> 01:07:05,767
That is an interesting
proposition.

1593
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:07,266
It hadn't crossed your mind?

1594
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,266
It might have.

1595
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,100
You know,
for two people who met

1596
01:07:11,233 --> 01:07:13,834
fighting over pepper
and salt shakers,

1597
01:07:13,967 --> 01:07:15,600
we're way ahead of the game.

1598
01:07:17,133 --> 01:07:18,967
We have done a lot
in a short amount of time.

1599
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:20,333
So...

1600
01:07:20,467 --> 01:07:22,300
let's keep the momentum going?

1601
01:07:22,433 --> 01:07:24,333
What did you have in mind?

1602
01:07:24,467 --> 01:07:27,734
I heard there's
a sleigh ride tonight.

1603
01:07:27,867 --> 01:07:29,467
I can pick you up around 6:00?

1604
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:31,000
Unless you have other plans.

1605
01:07:32,667 --> 01:07:35,133
I'm really behind on packing,

1606
01:07:35,266 --> 01:07:36,934
and the movers
are going to be here

1607
01:07:37,066 --> 01:07:39,000
in a couple of days.

1608
01:07:39,133 --> 01:07:42,734
Yeah, I guess the move
is pretty close, huh?

1609
01:07:42,867 --> 01:07:44,500
It'll be here
before we know it.

1610
01:07:44,633 --> 01:07:46,333
So, what are we saying?

1611
01:07:47,467 --> 01:07:49,800
That maybe
we shouldn't start something

1612
01:07:49,934 --> 01:07:50,967
we can't finish.

1613
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:52,734
Would've been nice.

1614
01:07:54,767 --> 01:07:56,700
All right, I'm gonna...

1615
01:07:57,934 --> 01:07:59,200
I'll see you around.

1616
01:08:18,333 --> 01:08:19,834
Sorry I'm late.

1617
01:08:19,967 --> 01:08:21,834
Where have you been?

1618
01:08:21,967 --> 01:08:24,033
I started writing
and I lost track of time.

1619
01:08:24,166 --> 01:08:25,400
But we already printed
your last story.

1620
01:08:25,533 --> 01:08:27,467
It's not for the paper.

1621
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:28,633
I started writing a new book,

1622
01:08:28,767 --> 01:08:30,967
and the pages
just poured out of me.

1623
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:31,967
That's awesome!

1624
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:33,000
I know.

1625
01:08:33,133 --> 01:08:35,834
And since
you're in such a good mood,

1626
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:37,967
there's one thing
I want to ask you...

1627
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:39,533
Yeah, what's up?

1628
01:08:39,667 --> 01:08:42,166
Are you taking
your desk chair with you?

1629
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:43,667
Because if not,

1630
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:44,800
can I have it?

1631
01:08:44,934 --> 01:08:47,333
What is your problem?

1632
01:08:47,467 --> 01:08:48,834
It's just
so much better than mine.

1633
01:08:48,967 --> 01:08:49,800
It, like, really goes.

1634
01:08:49,934 --> 01:08:50,867
Okay, it's all yours.

1635
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,133
Thanks, sis.

1636
01:08:52,266 --> 01:08:53,467
You know, this place
is not going to be the same

1637
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:54,500
without you.

1638
01:08:54,633 --> 01:08:55,800
I know.

1639
01:08:55,934 --> 01:08:57,333
But at least you'll always
have my chair

1640
01:08:57,467 --> 01:08:58,700
to remember me by.

1641
01:08:58,834 --> 01:08:59,900
Mm-hmm.
Let's get you a drink.

1642
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:01,867
Yes. Pour it on up.

1643
01:09:04,066 --> 01:09:04,967
Here's to having you on board.

1644
01:09:06,533 --> 01:09:07,467
Thanks.

1645
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,033
I'm very excited.

1646
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:12,734
Now, you mentioned on the phone

1647
01:09:12,867 --> 01:09:14,734
that you had some ideas
about the menu.

1648
01:09:14,867 --> 01:09:15,934
Yeah.

1649
01:09:16,066 --> 01:09:17,800
I've spent the last
two weeks in a small town

1650
01:09:17,934 --> 01:09:19,900
working at my aunt's restaurant.

1651
01:09:20,033 --> 01:09:21,300
Mainly comfort food,

1652
01:09:21,433 --> 01:09:24,967
but well-prepared, high-quality.

1653
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:26,100
It's the type of cooking

1654
01:09:26,233 --> 01:09:27,367
that reminded me

1655
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,600
why I wanted to become a chef
in the first place,

1656
01:09:29,734 --> 01:09:32,300
and the type of food
that first inspired me.

1657
01:09:32,433 --> 01:09:34,133
Now, now, don't get me wrong,

1658
01:09:34,266 --> 01:09:37,100
I love nouvelle cuisine,
I love it,

1659
01:09:37,233 --> 01:09:38,100
but I was thinking

1660
01:09:38,233 --> 01:09:40,200
maybe we could
combine the two.

1661
01:09:40,333 --> 01:09:43,000
Comfort and nouvelle.

1662
01:09:44,266 --> 01:09:46,133
I understand
where you're coming from,

1663
01:09:46,266 --> 01:09:48,433
and it's a unique approach.

1664
01:09:48,567 --> 01:09:51,900
It's just not the right one
for my vision.

1665
01:09:52,033 --> 01:09:52,934
Now, come on,

1666
01:09:53,066 --> 01:09:55,000
I'd like to introduce you
to the staff.

1667
01:09:59,066 --> 01:10:01,066
Okay, everybody.

1668
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:04,400
Time to open up
the Secret Santa gifts.

1669
01:10:05,533 --> 01:10:07,900
I think, this year,

1670
01:10:08,033 --> 01:10:09,367
Lou should go first.

1671
01:10:10,734 --> 01:10:11,600
Okay.

1672
01:10:11,734 --> 01:10:12,900
Are you my Secret Santa?

1673
01:10:13,033 --> 01:10:15,867
I'm not telling.

1674
01:10:23,867 --> 01:10:27,767
It's a going-away gift
from the entire staff.

1675
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:31,266
I can't believe you managed
to keep a secret!

1676
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:32,367
It took restraint.

1677
01:10:34,433 --> 01:10:36,133
Thank you.

1678
01:10:36,266 --> 01:10:38,433
This is the perfect gift,

1679
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:39,600
and I'm going to miss
all of you so much.

1680
01:10:39,734 --> 01:10:42,066
We're just so proud of you,

1681
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:45,300
and wish you all the best
on your journey.

1682
01:10:45,433 --> 01:10:46,600
Here's to Lou.

1683
01:10:46,734 --> 01:10:48,033
-To Lou!
-To Lou.

1684
01:10:48,166 --> 01:10:49,033
To Lou.

1685
01:10:49,166 --> 01:10:50,734
I'm gonna miss you, sis.

1686
01:10:50,867 --> 01:10:51,967
I love you guys.

1687
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:54,400
Hey, you made it!

1688
01:10:54,533 --> 01:10:55,400
Of course.

1689
01:10:55,533 --> 01:10:56,367
Here, let me help you with that.

1690
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:58,300
Thank you.

1691
01:10:58,433 --> 01:11:00,967
Merry Christmas Eve Eve,
everyone!

1692
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:03,166
Just wanted to say
thank you so much

1693
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:05,834
for another wonderful year
at the Tavern,

1694
01:11:05,967 --> 01:11:08,300
and winning back
the "Taste of Christmas" title

1695
01:11:08,433 --> 01:11:09,266
was just the perfect gift.

1696
01:11:10,667 --> 01:11:12,600
Yeah.

1697
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,433
And I also want to pay
a special thank you

1698
01:11:16,567 --> 01:11:17,433
to my nephew, Kyle,

1699
01:11:17,567 --> 01:11:20,533
who's also just invaluable

1700
01:11:20,667 --> 01:11:22,667
in preparing tonight's
celebration,

1701
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,533
and he's also done
a greater service for me.

1702
01:11:25,667 --> 01:11:28,166
He has decided, finally,

1703
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:29,934
after so many years away,

1704
01:11:30,066 --> 01:11:31,667
to spend Christmas
with his aunt.

1705
01:11:33,834 --> 01:11:35,300
Kyle, it means so much to me

1706
01:11:35,433 --> 01:11:37,700
to see how far you've come
in your life,

1707
01:11:37,834 --> 01:11:39,000
in your career,

1708
01:11:39,133 --> 01:11:40,500
and that you'd take the time
to share it.

1709
01:11:40,633 --> 01:11:42,533
Well, maybe
in the spirit of Christmas,

1710
01:11:42,667 --> 01:11:44,633
you can share
the secret ingredient

1711
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:45,767
in your meatloaf?

1712
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:48,934
I could...

1713
01:11:49,066 --> 01:11:51,600
if you're willing to share
the secret ingredient

1714
01:11:51,734 --> 01:11:53,300
for the Caroler's stew.

1715
01:11:54,967 --> 01:11:56,200
Maybe after dinner.

1716
01:11:56,333 --> 01:11:58,700
All right, everyone, dig in,

1717
01:11:58,834 --> 01:12:00,734
and thank you all again, really.

1718
01:12:06,967 --> 01:12:09,100
Hey, what's with the long face?

1719
01:12:09,233 --> 01:12:10,333
What are you talking about?

1720
01:12:10,467 --> 01:12:12,700
Well, for a guy who just
landed the perfect job,

1721
01:12:12,834 --> 01:12:13,700
you don't seem too excited.

1722
01:12:13,834 --> 01:12:15,166
Well, that's because
I didn't take it.

1723
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:16,233
I turned it down.

1724
01:12:16,367 --> 01:12:18,100
Why? What changed your mind?

1725
01:12:18,233 --> 01:12:20,934
On the drive back,
I had time to think about it,

1726
01:12:21,066 --> 01:12:22,600
and I guess you could say
Pine Grove.

1727
01:12:22,734 --> 01:12:25,567
You've wanted a job like that
forever, Kyle.

1728
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:27,767
Yeah, I know,

1729
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:31,834
but I had a rediscovery
over the last couple of weeks.

1730
01:12:31,967 --> 01:12:33,166
Cooking with you,

1731
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:35,200
and the contest,

1732
01:12:35,333 --> 01:12:36,433
it brought out something

1733
01:12:36,567 --> 01:12:38,500
I haven't felt in a long time.

1734
01:12:38,633 --> 01:12:41,934
I want to bring my own ideas
to my work,

1735
01:12:42,066 --> 01:12:43,266
and not just
implement someone else's,

1736
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:44,400
you know what I mean?

1737
01:12:44,533 --> 01:12:46,667
So, what are you going to do?

1738
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,033
I don't know,
I haven't thought that far yet.

1739
01:12:48,166 --> 01:12:51,133
Well, this might be
a happy coincidence then.

1740
01:12:51,266 --> 01:12:52,867
What do you mean?

1741
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,266
What about working here?

1742
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:55,767
As chef, here?

1743
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:57,867
Not, not just as chef,

1744
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,200
a partner.

1745
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:00,300
A partner?

1746
01:13:00,433 --> 01:13:02,767
I'm going to retire
eventually, Kyle.

1747
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:06,033
Not soon, but someday.

1748
01:13:06,166 --> 01:13:08,467
And I want someone I can trust

1749
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:11,567
to take care of the business
after I leave.

1750
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:13,834
Now, you don't
have to decide now,

1751
01:13:13,967 --> 01:13:16,667
just think about it.

1752
01:13:40,233 --> 01:13:42,200
You okay?

1753
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:45,333
Yeah.

1754
01:13:45,467 --> 01:13:47,066
Just feeling
a little bit nostalgic.

1755
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:48,300
Do you want to come over

1756
01:13:48,433 --> 01:13:49,834
and sit around
the Christmas tree?

1757
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:51,867
Or we could watch
a Christmas movie.

1758
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,600
I think I'm gonna take a walk,

1759
01:13:55,734 --> 01:13:56,667
clear my head.

1760
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,600
Well, whatever you got
on your mind,

1761
01:13:58,734 --> 01:14:00,700
I know you'll figure it out.

1762
01:14:00,834 --> 01:14:01,734
Yeah.

1763
01:14:01,867 --> 01:14:02,767
Thanks, Mom.

1764
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:03,834
Good night, Dad.

1765
01:14:03,967 --> 01:14:04,967
Good night.

1766
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:24,600
Hey.

1767
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:27,400
Hi.

1768
01:14:28,967 --> 01:14:30,266
Mind if I ask
what you're doing

1769
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:33,066
sitting alone
in the middle of town?

1770
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:34,667
Just thinking.

1771
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,100
About?

1772
01:14:36,233 --> 01:14:38,433
Too many things.

1773
01:14:38,567 --> 01:14:40,066
That's the problem.

1774
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,467
You mind if I join you?

1775
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,600
I've got a few things
I need to think about, too.

1776
01:14:44,734 --> 01:14:45,700
Sure.

1777
01:14:55,467 --> 01:14:58,300
You want to talk about it?

1778
01:14:58,433 --> 01:15:00,233
Not really.

1779
01:15:00,367 --> 01:15:01,533
You?

1780
01:15:01,667 --> 01:15:03,333
Nah...

1781
01:15:03,467 --> 01:15:05,834
I'm good just sitting here.

1782
01:15:08,367 --> 01:15:09,734
If you listen hard enough,

1783
01:15:09,867 --> 01:15:11,734
you can hear
the sounds of Christmas.

1784
01:15:11,867 --> 01:15:13,133
You can?

1785
01:15:13,266 --> 01:15:15,233
Shh... listen.

1786
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:19,066
I can't hear anything.

1787
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:22,400
I hear...

1788
01:15:22,533 --> 01:15:26,033
a fireplace crackling,

1789
01:15:26,166 --> 01:15:28,567
carolers singing...

1790
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:30,166
and even the bells

1791
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:34,533
from the sleigh ride
we didn't take.

1792
01:15:34,667 --> 01:15:38,467
Hey, you know, that would have
been a lot of fun.

1793
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,367
Maybe next year.

1794
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:44,400
I'll be back for Christmas.

1795
01:15:44,533 --> 01:15:46,734
Yeah, so will I.

1796
01:15:54,467 --> 01:15:56,066
You want to get that?

1797
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:57,967
Sorry.

1798
01:15:59,867 --> 01:16:03,400
Brice, hi...

1799
01:16:03,533 --> 01:16:04,734
Yes.

1800
01:16:04,867 --> 01:16:06,834
Tell Jeralyn
that I'll be right there.

1801
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:09,367
I'm gonna be an aunt.

1802
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:10,533
I've gotta go.

1803
01:16:10,667 --> 01:16:12,500
Hang on, I'll drive you.

1804
01:16:13,567 --> 01:16:15,800
Thank you.

1805
01:16:18,033 --> 01:16:19,100
I can't believe

1806
01:16:19,233 --> 01:16:20,767
our first grandchild was born
just after midnight.

1807
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:22,200
He is so cute.

1808
01:16:22,333 --> 01:16:24,033
We think so.

1809
01:16:24,166 --> 01:16:26,433
Where did Brice go?

1810
01:16:26,567 --> 01:16:27,433
I don't know.

1811
01:16:27,567 --> 01:16:28,734
He just said
he had something to do.

1812
01:16:28,867 --> 01:16:29,867
It's going to be a lot of fun

1813
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,633
having a little one
around again.

1814
01:16:31,767 --> 01:16:33,467
Mm-hmm, and babysitting,

1815
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:34,967
and watching him growing up.

1816
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:37,266
I am going to love
being a grandmother.

1817
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:38,967
You guys are going to be
the best grandparents.

1818
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:41,400
And I like the part
about the babysitting.

1819
01:16:42,734 --> 01:16:43,967
So do I.

1820
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:47,066
I'll just have to catch up
when I come back on visits.

1821
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:49,200
We'll be here...

1822
01:16:49,333 --> 01:16:50,734
and you'll always be his aunt,

1823
01:16:50,867 --> 01:16:52,767
no matter where you are.

1824
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:55,066
I don't think
that's good enough.

1825
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:57,200
I just heard

1826
01:16:57,333 --> 01:16:59,100
that we've got
the first Christmas Eve baby

1827
01:16:59,233 --> 01:17:00,533
born today,

1828
01:17:00,667 --> 01:17:03,133
and I've got some photos of him
already printed out.

1829
01:17:03,266 --> 01:17:04,433
-Oh!

1830
01:17:04,567 --> 01:17:06,367
Can I have one of those?

1831
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:08,166
Sure. Why?

1832
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:11,867
Well, since he is
the first Christmas baby

1833
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
born in Pine Grove,

1834
01:17:14,133 --> 01:17:15,900
and he is
a fifth-generation Webb,

1835
01:17:16,033 --> 01:17:17,000
it's only fitting

1836
01:17:17,133 --> 01:17:18,767
to put this picture
into the time capsule.

1837
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:21,533
And that way,
in 100 years from now,

1838
01:17:21,667 --> 01:17:22,834
when the town opens it,

1839
01:17:22,967 --> 01:17:24,867
there will, hopefully,

1840
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,033
still be some Webbs here

1841
01:17:26,166 --> 01:17:28,000
to find out
what Christmas was like for us.

1842
01:17:28,133 --> 01:17:29,200
If you want to get
that picture

1843
01:17:29,333 --> 01:17:30,233
in the time capsule,

1844
01:17:30,367 --> 01:17:31,800
shouldn't you all
be getting over there?

1845
01:17:31,934 --> 01:17:34,266
The ceremony is starting soon,

1846
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,266
and someone
has to take my place.

1847
01:17:38,633 --> 01:17:41,266
You sure went to great lengths
to get out of your solo...

1848
01:17:42,333 --> 01:17:43,967
...but I do have to say,

1849
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:44,867
he's so worth it.

1850
01:17:48,467 --> 01:17:52,467
It's my pleasure to now
introduce Louise Webb

1851
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:55,133
to sing "This Christmas".

1852
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:46,000
Thank you, Lou.
That was beautiful!

1853
01:19:46,133 --> 01:19:47,934
Thank you.

1854
01:19:49,066 --> 01:19:51,433
And next up,

1855
01:19:51,567 --> 01:19:55,800
it's time to load
the Christmas time capsule!

1856
01:19:57,567 --> 01:19:59,100
As you all know,

1857
01:19:59,233 --> 01:20:01,300
everyone was invited
to submit items

1858
01:20:01,433 --> 01:20:03,000
for the new time capsule.

1859
01:20:03,133 --> 01:20:05,800
Your submissions
were overwhelming,

1860
01:20:05,934 --> 01:20:08,133
but we narrowed it down
to 12 items

1861
01:20:08,266 --> 01:20:12,133
we felt would best represent
to future generations

1862
01:20:12,266 --> 01:20:15,567
what Christmas in Pine Grove
was like in 2021.

1863
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:17,500
So, once again

1864
01:20:17,633 --> 01:20:19,300
I'm delighted
to turn things over

1865
01:20:19,433 --> 01:20:21,233
to Eli and Lou Webb.

1866
01:20:23,166 --> 01:20:25,400
Thank you, Mayor Townsend.

1867
01:20:25,533 --> 01:20:27,100
In no particular order,

1868
01:20:27,233 --> 01:20:28,967
these are the items...

1869
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:32,500
a Christmas Edition
of The Pine Grove Register...

1870
01:20:33,934 --> 01:20:36,800
A not-so-lovely
Christmas sweater,

1871
01:20:36,934 --> 01:20:39,467
which I hope they don't
judge us too harshly for.

1872
01:20:40,633 --> 01:20:42,133
We have
a picture of Main Street

1873
01:20:42,266 --> 01:20:43,100
as it looks today.

1874
01:20:45,367 --> 01:20:46,500
We have a menu,

1875
01:20:46,633 --> 01:20:49,533
and an award-winning
"Taste of Christmas" recipe

1876
01:20:49,667 --> 01:20:51,000
from our beloved
Pine Grove Tavern.

1877
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:54,200
Did you submit the recipe?

1878
01:20:56,133 --> 01:20:58,300
And before we continue,

1879
01:20:58,433 --> 01:20:59,900
we're including a photo

1880
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:02,033
of Pine Grove's newest resident,

1881
01:21:02,166 --> 01:21:03,300
Christopher Webb,

1882
01:21:03,433 --> 01:21:05,433
the youngest descendant
of one of our town's founders,

1883
01:21:05,567 --> 01:21:06,467
Louis Webb.

1884
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:08,300
Aw...

1885
01:21:09,667 --> 01:21:11,767
This is what Christmas
is all about.

1886
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:13,200
Family.

1887
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:19,834
Actually, uh...

1888
01:21:19,967 --> 01:21:22,000
there are a few things

1889
01:21:22,133 --> 01:21:23,567
that are going to take
some getting used to,

1890
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:25,367
which is what I was trying
to tell you about last night.

1891
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:27,467
Hmm...

1892
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,033
What things?

1893
01:21:29,166 --> 01:21:32,967
Well, I decided not to take
that job in Chicago.

1894
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:34,233
Really?

1895
01:21:34,367 --> 01:21:35,400
Yeah.

1896
01:21:35,533 --> 01:21:36,567
To be honest,

1897
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:39,700
I haven't had
this much fun cooking since...

1898
01:21:39,834 --> 01:21:41,533
I don't even know when,

1899
01:21:41,667 --> 01:21:45,900
so I decided to stay here
and partner with my aunt.

1900
01:21:46,033 --> 01:21:48,233
Well, you are
an award-winning team.

1901
01:21:48,367 --> 01:21:50,533
You know, you had
something to do with it.

1902
01:21:50,667 --> 01:21:52,166
I did?

1903
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:53,333
Mm-hmm.

1904
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:56,266
I don't know,
maybe we could make it work.

1905
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:59,800
I'm willing to go to New York
as often as I need to,

1906
01:21:59,934 --> 01:22:03,467
because, uh...

1907
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,166
I'm falling for you.

1908
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:12,200
I also had a change of plans.

1909
01:22:13,333 --> 01:22:14,367
Oh, really?

1910
01:22:15,333 --> 01:22:17,266
I'm not moving to New York.

1911
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:18,800
What?

1912
01:22:20,033 --> 01:22:21,333
Why?

1913
01:22:21,467 --> 01:22:23,467
I can write from anywhere,

1914
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:26,133
and when the time is right,
I can find a publisher,

1915
01:22:26,266 --> 01:22:28,133
but this...

1916
01:22:28,266 --> 01:22:29,734
is right now.

1917
01:22:32,033 --> 01:22:35,867
I'm falling for you, too.

1918
01:22:47,867 --> 01:22:51,367
Seeing as Christmas
is right around the corner...

1919
01:22:54,066 --> 01:22:55,400
Go ahead.

1920
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:00,500
It's not too corny, is it?

1921
01:23:00,633 --> 01:23:02,333
-No!
-Okay.

1922
01:23:02,467 --> 01:23:03,600
Just corny enough.

1923
01:23:03,734 --> 01:23:04,867
I love it.

1924
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,633
You may not have noticed
Marcy's pins,

1925
01:23:07,767 --> 01:23:08,934
but you do pay attention.

1926
01:23:13,767 --> 01:23:14,633
Did you see that?

1927
01:23:14,767 --> 01:23:16,200
The beacon just lit up.

1928
01:23:16,333 --> 01:23:17,667
I don't know
if it was the beacon,

1929
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:20,033
but, yeah,
I thought I saw a light.

1930
01:23:20,166 --> 01:23:21,533
Probably a power surge,

1931
01:23:21,667 --> 01:23:23,000
energy surge,
something like that.

1932
01:23:23,133 --> 01:23:25,800
Maybe,

1933
01:23:25,934 --> 01:23:27,967
but it is Christmas,

1934
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:30,433
and that's when
the magic happens.
