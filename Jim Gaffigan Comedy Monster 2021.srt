<i>[Jim] Thank you! Thank you!</i>

00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:18,476
<i>Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much.</i>

00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:22,272

<i>Aw, thank you so much. Thank you.</i>

8
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:29,195
<i>Aw… That's so nice.</i>

9
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,824
<i>That almost makes me forget</i>
<i>we're all gonna be dead in a week.</i>

10

<i>[laughter]</i>

11
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:37,537
<i>I'm kidding. It'll probably be a month.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

13
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:41,374
<i>Remember when we thought</i>
<i>the pandemic was over?</i>

14
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,584
<i>[laughter]</i>

15
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:43,710
<i>Everyone was so happy.</i>

18
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:50,050
<i>We probably looked so stupid. [chuckles]</i>

19
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:52,969
<i>Everyone was patting themselves</i>
<i>on the back.</i>

20
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,138
<i>"You know, I'm just glad</i>
<i>I could help out the sick,</i>

21
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,514
<i>by staying inside."</i>

22
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,308

<i>[laughter]</i>

27
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,318
<i>'Cause it's not over.</i>

28
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:12,072
<i>The pandemic is like a TV show</i>
<i>you thought was canceled,</i>

29
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,491
<i>and then it got picked up by Netflix.</i>

30

<i>[clears throat]</i>

33
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:25,460
<i>I didn't really pace myself</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

35
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:31,174

<i>[laughter]</i>

37
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,260
<i>Parents know the feeling.</i>

38
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:37,430
<i>It's like changing that diaper</i>
<i>in the middle of the night.</i>

39
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:40,683
<i>You're exhausted. It's disgusting.</i>

40
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:41,893
<i>But you have to do it.</i>

41
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:45,396
<i>So you change the diaper,</i>
<i>you finally get the sleeper back on,</i>

42
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,650
<i>and as you gently lay the baby</i>
<i>back in the crib,</i>

43
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,819
<i>you hear the diaper fill up again.</i>

44
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,028
<i>[laughter]</i>

45
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,989
<i>And that's what the year 2021 is.</i>

00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,700
<i>[laughter and applause]</i>

47
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,369
<i>Over and over.</i>

48
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,914
<i>[cheering]</i>

49
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:06,292
<i>It's just a diaper filling up</i>
<i>over and over. [chuckles]</i>

50
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,836
<i>[laughter]</i>

51
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:11,047
<i>I kind of miss the early days</i>
<i>of the pandemic.</i>

52
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,173
<i>Those were fun.</i>

53
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:15,051
<i>Back when we thought washing our hands</i>
<i>would protect us.</i>

54
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,261
<i>[laughter]</i>

55
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:18,680
<i>"Everyone, wash your hands.</i>
<i>We'll be fine."</i>

56
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:20,390
<i>"Okay."</i>

57
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,642
<i>[laughter]</i>

58
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:25,478
<i>Remember before</i>
<i>there were readily available tests,</i>

59
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:29,065
<i>everyone had that friend that used to brag</i>
<i>"Yeah, I already had COVID."</i>

60
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,359
<i>-[laughter]</i>
<i>-"I had it back in '91."</i>

61
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,153
<i>[laughter]</i>

62
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,989
<i>"Yeah. Back then, it was called COVID-91."</i>

63
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,448
<i>[laughter]</i>

64
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:40,535
<i>"Had it a couple times.</i>
<i>Got rid of it by washing my hands."</i>

65
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:44,414
<i>'Cause the symptoms were confusing.</i>

66
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,999
<i>They're still confusing.</i>

67
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:47,625
<i>It's like, "What are the symptoms?"</i>

68
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:48,793
<i>"Everything."</i>

69
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,461
<i>[audience laughing]</i>

70
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,006
<i>[stammers] "What do you mean, everything?"</i>

71
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,383
<i>"Asking a question is a symptom."</i>

72
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,719
<i>[laughter]</i>

73
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:00,221
<i>[grunts] "Well, that can't be true."</i>

74
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,099
<i>"Denial is a major symptom."</i>

75
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,519
<i>[laughter and applause]</i>

76
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,689
<i>Did you wipe down your groceries?</i>
<i>I did that.</i>

77
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,065
<i>It felt so silly.</i>

78
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:14,485
<i>You know, like, "I'm just a normal guy</i>
<i>cleaning a Triscuit box."</i>

79
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:20,325
<i>[laughter and applause]</i>

80
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:23,036
<i>"Is this what OCD feels like?"</i>

81
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,621
<i>[laughter]</i>

82
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,124
<i>Couple weeks later, you're like,</i>
<i>"Nah, they look clean to me."</i>

83
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,375
<i>[laughter]</i>

84
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,919
<i>"I cleaned 'em."</i>

85
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,295
<i>[laughter]</i>

86
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,255
<i>But you had to take the precautions.</i>

87
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,550
<i>There was no uniformity.</i>
<i>Everyone talked a big game, right?</i>

88
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:38,927
<i>"Oh, we're on lockdown."</i>

89
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,553
<i>"No work, no school, you know."</i>

90
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,971
<i>"We got our bubble."</i>

91
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,641
<i>"Bubble's just my family</i>
<i>and these two people we see</i>

92
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,059
<i>at a weekly sex party."</i>

93
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:48,478
<i>[laughter]</i>

94
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,480
<i>"I figured, better safe than sorry."</i>

95
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,776
<i>'Cause we all went through</i>
<i>the same pandemic,</i>

96
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:57,612
<i>but we didn't have</i>
<i>the same experience, right?</i>

97
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:58,738
<i>There were factors.</i>

98
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,615
<i>Like, if you were 25 and healthy,</i>

99
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:03,576
<i>you're like, "Whatever.</i>
<i>I'm going on a COVID cruise."</i>

100
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,078
<i>[laughter]</i>

101
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,413
<i>But if you were over the age of 25--</i>

102
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,290
<i>and it may surprise you, but I am…</i>

103
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,458
<i>[laughter]</i>

104
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,127
<i>…you watched the news more closely, right?</i>

105
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,130
<i>The news guys would be like,</i>
<i>"High-risk people are older."</i>

106
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,758
<i>You're like, [stammers] "Well, how old?"</i>

107
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,593
<i>"Like old old,</i>

108
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,471
<i>or didn't-have-a-cellphone-</i>
<i>in-high-school old?"</i>

109
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:25,807
<i>-[laughter and applause]</i>
<i>-[grunts]</i>

110
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:26,933
<i>Right?</i>

111
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:30,019
<i>[applause]</i>

112
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,898
<i>'Cause nobody thinks of themselves as old.</i>

113
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:34,816
<i>[giggles]</i>

114
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:39,612
<i>The reality of your age just occasionally</i>
<i>slaps you across the face.</i>

115
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:40,530
<i>[chuckling]</i>

116
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,700
<i>I did this benefit for a hospital.</i>
<i>It was a fancy event.</i>

117
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,035
<i>When I showed up,</i>
<i>the woman running the event was like,</i>

118
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:49,497
<i>"Oh, my gosh.</i>
<i>We went to the same college."</i>

119
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,790
<i>She was younger, but we talked</i>

120
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:53,459
<i>and we realized we hung out</i>
<i>at the same places.</i>

121
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:56,170
<i>At the end of the event,</i>
<i>I was leaving and she ran up to me,</i>

122
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:59,132
<i>she was like, "I need to know</i>
<i>what year you graduated college."</i>

123
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,009
<i>I was like, "1988."</i>

124
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,928
<i>And she was like, "Oh, my gosh.</i>
<i>That's the year I was born."</i>

125
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,680
<i>[laughter]</i>

126
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,015
<i>Slap!</i>

127
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,310
<i>Right across the face. [chuckles]</i>

128
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,145
<i>I didn't even know what to say.</i>

129
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:15,106
<i>I was like,</i>
<i>"Ah, that's the year I was born too."</i>

130
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,983
<i>[laughter]</i>

131
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,360
<i>She looked at me like,</i>
<i>[nasal voice] "That's not funny."</i>

132
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,529
<i>And then I got in my car</i>
<i>and stuffed food in my mouth</i>

133
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,197
<i>until I stopped feeling anything.</i>

134
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:26,034
<i>-[laughter]</i>
<i>-[grunting]</i>

135
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,871
<i>Sometimes you had to decipher</i>
<i>the news. Right?</i>

136
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,080
<i>The newscaster would be like,</i>

137
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,792
<i>[in a deep voice] "The vulnerable are</i>
<i>older and people with comorbidities."</i>

138
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,586
<i>You're like, "Co what?"</i>

139
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,796
<i>"Comorbidity."</i>

140
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,674
<i>Which eventually we figured out</i>
<i>was just code for,</i>

141
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,843
<i>"All the fat asses are gonna die."</i>

142
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,678
<i>[laughter]</i>

143
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,181
<i>But they couldn't say that on the news.</i>

144
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,641
<i>They couldn't have Sanjay Gupta be like,</i>

145
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,770
<i>"Well, Anderson,</i>
<i>all the fat asses are gonna die."</i>

146
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,605
<i>[laughter]</i>

147
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,483
<i>So they said comorbidities.</i>

148
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,902
<i>And at home, we were like,</i>
<i>"Honey, what is a comorb--"</i>

149
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,403
<i>"I don't know. Pass the gravy."</i>

150
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:05,073
<i>[laughter]</i>

151
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:08,993
<i>In time, we figured out</i>
<i>they were talking about fat people.</i>

152
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:12,747
<i>And if you were overweight,</i>
<i>you were like, [stammers] "How fat?"</i>

153
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,873
<i>[laughter]</i>

154
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:17,835
<i>Or like, "Are we talking Walmart fat</i>
<i>or Jim Gaffigan fat?"</i>

155
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:24,133
<i>[cheering and applauding]</i>

156
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,676
<i>I got the message.</i>

157
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,970
<i>I dunno, I totally got the message.</i>
<i>I started working out.</i>

158
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,680
<i>I started eating healthy.</i>
<i>I was going good.</i>

159
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,600
<i>Then one day I looked in the mirror</i>
<i>and I was like, "Ah, enough of that."</i>

160
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:33,768
<i>[laughter]</i>

161
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:37,063
<i>Turns out, life or death,</i>
<i>not the motivator you'd think it would be.</i>

162
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,606
<i>[laughter]</i>

163
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:39,732
<i>"You could live longer."</i>

164
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,109
<i>"Not a good enough reason."</i>

165
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,360
<i>[laughter]</i>

166
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:44,904
<i>"Can you sweeten the deal,</i>
<i>maybe throw in a pizza?"</i>

167
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,155
<i>[laughter]</i>

168
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,032
<i>I tried. I tried.</i>

169
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,867
<i>My wife bought me a scale,</i>

170
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,869
<i>so the romance is still alive.</i>

171
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,913
<i>[laughter]</i>

172
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:56,874
<i>I didn't ask for it.</i>
<i>She gave it to me as a </i>gift.

173
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,292
<i>[laughter]</i>

174
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,002
<i>I could never do something like that.</i>

175
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:03,548
<i>"Happy birthday, honey.</i>
<i>I bought you a scale and some makeup."</i>

176
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,508
<i>[laughter]</i>

177
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,218
<i>"Just lookin' out for you, sweetie."</i>

178
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:08,845
<i>[giggles]</i>

179
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,304
<i>It's a high-tech scale.</i>

180
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:13,808
<i>Comes with an app so the government</i>
<i>can know how overweight I am.</i>

181
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,852
<i>[laughter]</i>

182
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,062
<i>I don't know why there's an app.</i>

183
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,898
<i>Maybe so I can be the victim</i>
<i>of Ransomware.</i>

184
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,316
<i>[laughter]</i>

185
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,069
<i>[southern accent] "Pay up or we're</i>
<i>telling everyone how fat you are."</i>

186
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,698
<i>[shrill voice]</i>
<i>"But I don't have any crypto currency."</i>

187
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:29,740
<i>[laughter]</i>

188
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,327
<i>[normal voice]</i>
<i>I set up the app, stood on the scale,</i>

189
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:36,497
<i>my weight showed up on the phone,</i>
<i>150 pounds.</i>

190
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,833
<i>[laughter]</i>

191
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,793
<i>All right, it was over 200.</i>

192
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,672
<i>-All right, it was way over 200.</i>
<i>-[laughter]</i>

193
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:48,134
<i>If it was an old-fashioned scale,</i>
<i>you wouldn't see the number 200.</i>

194
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,302
<i>[laughter]</i>

195
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:51,804
<i>But it was in the 200 family.</i>

196
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,099
<i>And underneath my weight, on the phone,</i>

197
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:58,060
<i>there was this word</i>
<i>in small red lettering.</i>

198
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,146
<i>I didn't have my glasses on</i>
<i>so I asked my daughter.</i>

199
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,690
<i>I was like, "What does that say?"</i>
<i>She was like, "Obese."</i>

200
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,108
<i>[laughter]</i>

201
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:07,487
<i>Slap! Right across the face. [chuckles]</i>

202
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:11,991
<i>I just looked at my daughter,</i>
<i>I'm like, "Ah, I gotta update this app."</i>

203
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,659
<i>[laughter]</i>

204
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,078
<i>And then I ran to the kitchen</i>
<i>and stuffed food in my mouth</i>

205
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,622
<i>till I stopped feeling anything.</i>

206
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:20,374
<i>-[laughter and applause]</i>
<i>-[grunting]</i>

207
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,630
<i>Still wearing masks.</i>

208
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:28,382
<i>There was that time</i>
<i>when nobody had to wear a mask, right?</i>

209
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,509
<i>That was a fun day.</i>

210
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,886
<i>[laughter]</i>

211
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:35,848
<i>Remember the first time you went out</i>
<i>in public without a mask?</i>

212
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,225
<i>It was weird, right?</i>

213
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:40,478
<i>You felt naked.</i>
<i>You were like, "Oh, I'm so European."</i>

214
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:43,022
<i>[laughter]</i>

215
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,066
<i>"What is this, the French Riviera?"</i>

216
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:49,028
<i>I was kind of tempted to wear,</i>
<i>like, a thong mask.</i>

217
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,154
<i>[laughter]</i>

218
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:53,199
<i>You know, something tasteful yet naughty.</i>

219
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,869
<i>"I can see his cheeks,</i>
<i>but there's still a mystery."</i>

220
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,162
<i>[laughter]</i>

221
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,373
<i>"Ooh-la-la."</i>

<i>-[laughter]</i>
<i>-[chuckles]</i>

227
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:19,183
<i>Initially, it was strange seeing</i>
<i>other people's faces without a mask.</i>

228
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:22,520
<i>You wanted to go up to some people like,</i>
<i>"You should stick with the mask."</i>

229
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:23,521
<i>[laughter]</i>

230
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:26,607
<i>"It's a better look for you.</i>
<i>You in a mask is better for everyone."</i>

231
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,025
<i>[laughter]</i>

232
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:32,488
<i>Did you meet anyone during the pandemic</i>
<i>where you only knew them with a mask?</i>

233
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,991
<i>And then when you finally</i>
<i>saw them barefaced,</i>

234
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,617
<i>you're like, "Yikes."</i>

235
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:37,994
<i>[laughter]</i>

236
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,370
<i>You felt like you were catfished.</i>

237
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:42,206
<i>You're like, "Wow, your face</i>
<i>doesn't match your voice at all."</i>

238
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,165
<i>[laughter]</i>

239

<i>"And who stole your chin?"</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

241
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,923
<i>Of course, the biggest reveal</i>
<i>of the pandemic</i>

242
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,926
<i>was how many crazy people there are.</i>

243
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,011
<i>[laughter]</i>

244
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,679
<i>That was a bit of a surprise.</i>

245
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,849
<i>We all knew there were</i>
<i>some Unabombers out there, but,</i>

246
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,767
<i>nobody thought there were that many.</i>

247
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,060
<i>[laughter]</i>

248
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,605
<i>Or that we were related</i>
<i>to a couple of them.</i>

249
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,148
<i>[laughter and applause]</i>

250

<i>[cheering and applauding]</i>

252
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,408
<i>'Cause everyone had</i>
<i>that relative or friend</i>

253
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,619
<i>that came out as bonkers.</i>

254
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,997
<i>"I no longer believe in reality."</i>

255
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,832
<i>[laughter]</i>

256
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,125
<i>"Good to know."</i>

257
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:30,171
<i>It was like a gender reveal for insanity.</i>

258
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:31,881
<i>[laughter]</i>

259
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,508
<i>"The truth is no longer true."</i>

260
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:35,926
<i>"See you at Thanksgiving."</i>

261
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,595
<i>[laughter]</i>

262
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,513
<i>I feel like it happened for me more often</i>

263
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:42,850
<i>'cause I've always had friends</i>
<i>that are eccentric thinkers</i>

264
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,727
<i>and they're normally really entertaining.</i>

265
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,981
<i>They're like, [deep voice]</i>
<i>"Bigfoot's real, man. Bigfoot is real."</i>

266
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:52,234
<i>But that same person, at one point</i>
<i>during the pandemic, was like,</i>

267
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,487
<i>[deep voice] "Tom Hanks eats babies."</i>

268
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,697
<i>[laughter]</i>

269
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:00,201
<i>-"Don't say that."</i>
<i>-[audience laughing]</i>

270
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,994
<i>[deep voice] "Tom Hanks does eat babies."</i>

271
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,914
<i>"And if you don't believe that,</i>
<i>then you eat babies."</i>

272
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,457
<i>[laughter]</i>

273
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,583
<i>[normal voice] "All right."</i>

274
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,294
<i>"Tom Hanks eats babies."</i>

275

<i>[laughter]</i>

276
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,673
<i>"He always seemed</i>
<i>like a baby-eater to me."</i>

277
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,679
<i>The thing I missed most</i>
<i>during the lockdown was restaurants.</i>

278
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,138
<i>I know that's a surprise.</i>

279
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,181
<i>[laughter]</i>

280
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:24,558
<i>I didn't even realize</i>
<i>how much I missed restaurants</i>

281
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,644
<i>'til the first time I went out to eat</i>

282
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,689
<i>and I caught myself catcalling</i>
<i>other people's food.</i>

283
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:30,856
<i>[laughter]</i>

284
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,234
<i>"Oh, yeah."</i>

00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,111
<i>[laughter]</i>

286
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,238
<i>"What I would do to you."</i>

<i>[growling]</i>

290
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,495
<i>"Jim, you're in public."</i>
<i>"Oh, sorry."</i>

291
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,497
<i>[laughter]</i>

292
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,710
<i>This is gonna kind of sound pandering,</i>

293
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:54,797
<i>but I believe the pandemic</i>
<i>has been hardest on mothers.</i>

294
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,883
<i>-Definitely hardest on mothers. Right?</i>
<i>-[cheering and applauding]</i>

295
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:01,429
<i>Or the men who had to live</i>
<i>with those mothers.</i>

296
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,472
<i>[laughter]</i>

297
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,225
<i>It was insane for--</i>
<i>I don't know how my wife did it.</i>

298
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:09,520
<i>We had five children</i>
<i>doing distance-learning.</i>

299
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:10,646
<i>And my kids were good.</i>

300
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,898
<i>They totally kept a distance</i>
<i>from learning.</i>

301
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,109
<i>[laughter]</i>

302
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,738
<i>We asked children to do school</i>

303
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,991
<i>on the same device they play </i>Minecraft<i>.</i>

304
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,159
<i>[laughter]</i>

305
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,536
<i>It's like holding</i>
<i>a Weight Watchers meeting</i>

306
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,121
<i>in a Wendy's.</i>

307
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:29,331
<i>[laughter]</i>

308
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,292
<i>I mean, it was insane.</i>

309
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:36,881
<i>[cheering and applauding]</i>

310
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:39,550
<i>I definitely gained an appreciation</i>

311
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:42,136
<i>for how difficult it is to be a teacher.</i>

312
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:45,389
<i>And what a poor career choice that was.</i>

313
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:48,017
<i>[cheering and applauding]</i>

314
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,143
<i>Right?</i>

315
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:53,731
<i>I guess it was, uh, after the first case</i>
<i>of Scotch, I turned to my wife…</i>

316
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,566
<i>[laughter]</i>

317
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:59,069
<i>…and I said, "When this is over,</i>
<i>if there's even an opening,</i>

318
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,614
<i>I'll take you wherever you wanna go.</i>
<i>Wherever you wanna go."</i>

319
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,824
<i>My wife was like,</i>
<i>"I want to go to Hawaii."</i>

320
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,368
<i>And I was like,</i>
<i>"I was thinking more Tri-State area."</i>

321
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,204
<i>[laughter]</i>

322
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,540
<i>She was like, "I wanna go to Hawaii</i>
<i>and I wanna bring the kids."</i>

323
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,459
<i>And I was like, "Whose kids?"</i>

324
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,169
<i>[laughter]</i>

325
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:17,087
<i>She was like, "Our kids."</i>

326
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,715
<i>I did the research,</i>
<i>saw that it was cheaper than a divorce,</i>

327
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,050
<i>so we went to Hawaii.</i>

328
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,343
<i>[laughter]</i>

329
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:24,220
<i>And… [scoffs]</i>

330
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,222
<i>[cheering and applauding]</i>

331
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:30,601
<i>Hawaii is such a special place.</i>
<i>It really is.</i>

332
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,645
<i>It's like there's the "Aloha Spirit",</i>

333
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:35,606
<i>where people greet each other</i>
<i>with "Aloha," but I'm so awkward,</i>

334
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:38,734
<i>so they'll be like, "Aloha,"</i>
<i>and I'll be like, "Hello ha."</i>

335
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,319
<i>[laughter]</i>

336
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,363
<i>Does that mean something? That means…</i>

337
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:45,157
<i>Even when I would use</i>
<i>the Hawaiian terms properly,</i>

338
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,283
<i>it would backfire.</i>

339
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,828
<i>Like if I said, "Mahalo,"</i>
<i>the natives would look at me like,</i>

340
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,539
<i>-"You don't have to do that."</i>
<i>-[laughter]</i>

341
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,833
<i>"Just nod your head</i>
<i>and we'll bring you pork."</i>

342
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,042
<i>[laughter]</i>

343
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,710
<i>'Cause I stuck out in Hawaii.</i>

344
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,504
<i>I didn't even look like a tourist.</i>

345
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,256
<i>I looked like someone they brought in</i>

346
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,466
<i>to make the tourists feel</i>
<i>more comfortable.</i>

347
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,051
<i>[laughter]</i>

348
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:07,054
<i>"You're fine. You wanna see awkward,</i>
<i>look at Jim Gaffigan."</i>

349
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,306
<i>[laughter]</i>

350
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,434
<i>Hawaii, it's incomparable</i>
<i>to any other state.</i>

351
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,353
<i>It's a tropical paradise.</i>

352
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:18,148
<i>It's almost like Hawaii</i>
<i>was this Polynesian island nation</i>

353
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,650
<i>that we just took over.</i>

354
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,235
<i>-[laughter]</i>
<i>-You know what I mean?</i>

355
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:23,237
<i>Like, it wasn't even part</i>
<i>of the United States.</i>

356
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,197
<i>We just went in like it was an open house.</i>

357
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,366
<i>"Nice. Nice."</i>

358
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:28,367
<i>[laughter]</i>

359
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,870
<i>"We could do our honeymoon here.</i>
<i>We'll take it."</i>

360
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,079
<i>[laughter]</i>

361
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,039
<i>The Hawaiians were like,</i>
<i>"We're our own country."</i>

362
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,917
<i>"That's cute. I love your flower shirt.</i>
<i>Gotta get one of them."</i>

363
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,669
<i>[laughter]</i>

364
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,797
<i>And Hawaiians will tell you,</i>
<i>they'll come right up to you.</i>

365
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,215
<i>They'll be, "You stole this land."</i>

366
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,802
<i>And I'm like, "Don't know how to break it</i>
<i>to you, but we stole all the land."</i>

367
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,679
<i>[laughter, applause]</i>

368
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:51,473
<i>"Probably just stings a little more</i>
<i>'cause it's pretty here."</i>

369
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,851
<i>[applause]</i>

370
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,645
<i>"Believe me, there's people in Detroit</i>
<i>pissed at us."</i>

371
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,230
<i>[laughter]</i>

372
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,317
<i>My wife chose Hawaii</i>
<i>because my wife loves the beach.</i>

373
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,444
<i>And as you can see, so do I.</i>

374
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,195
<i>[laughter]</i>

375
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,575
<i>I spent the entire time applying</i>
<i>and re-applying sunscreen</i>

376
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:13,078
<i>which, thankfully, makes my skin whiter.</i>

377
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,164
<i>[laughter]</i>

378
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:18,208
<i>What cruel bastard decided</i>

379
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:22,046
<i>that the goo that protects</i>
<i>pale people from the sun</i>

380
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:25,341
<i>should also make them look</i>
<i>like White Walkers?</i>

381
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,592
<i>[laughter]</i>

382
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,677
<i>It's… it's just cruel.</i>

383
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,930
<i>They should offer other colors.</i>

384
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,599
<i>"Cool. There's one of the guys</i>
<i>from Blue Man Group."</i>

385
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,142
<i>[laughter]</i>

386
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:38,812
<i>I don't even know why sunscreen is white.</i>
<i>What was the thinking?</i>

387
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:42,399
<i>"Well, you know, those pale people</i>
<i>love ranch dressing, so…"</i>

388
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,484
<i>[laughter]</i>

389
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,861
<i>"…let's keep it in their wheelhouse."</i>

390
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,949
<i>'Cause I don't tan. I don't kind of tan.</i>

391
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,034
<i>There's no medium rare for me.</i>

392
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,371
<i>I either look</i>
<i>like I've never been outside,</i>

393
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,998
<i>or I was just released from a burn unit.</i>

394
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,583
<i>[laughter]</i>

395
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,251
<i>There's no in-between.</i>

396
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,630
<i>And I know people go</i>
<i>to the beach to relax.</i>

397
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,507
<i>People find the beach very relaxing.</i>

398
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,800
<i>Not so much for me.</i>

399
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,469
<i>It's like being allergic to bees</i>

400
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:13,263
<i>and then, for vacation,</i>
<i>becoming a beekeeper.</i>

401
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,640
<i>[laughter]</i>

402
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:17,226
<i>My one goal was to just not burn.</i>

403
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,520
<i>I didn't want to be the sunburned adult.</i>

404
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:22,022
<i>You see a kid with a sunburn,</i>
<i>you're like, "Parenting is hard."</i>

405
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,024
<i>You see an adult with a sunburn,</i>
<i>you're like,</i>

406
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,442
<i>"That's an alcoholic."</i>

407
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,903
<i>-[laughter]</i>
<i>-Right?</i>

408
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,029
<i>'Cause…</i>

409
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,073
<i>[cheering and applauding]</i>

410
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,784
<i>A sunburn on an adult</i>

411
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:36,161
<i>is like a scarlet letter</i>

412
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,705
<i>for poor judgment.</i>

413
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:38,706
<i>[laughter]</i>

414
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,332
<i>There is no excuse.</i>

415
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,793
<i>[gruff voice]</i>
<i>"Well, I was caught off-guard this time."</i>

416
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:44,920
<i>[laughter]</i>

417
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,881
<i>"I didn't know the fireball in the sky</i>
<i>would be hot this time."</i>

418
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,509
<i>[laughter]</i>

419
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:55,347
<i>[normal voice] When we weren't</i>
<i>at the beach, we did activities.</i>

420
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,850
<i>I went zip-lining for the last time.</i>

421
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,393
<i>[laughter]</i>

422
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:02,062
<i>What is wrong with us?</i>

423
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,231
<i>"Hey, you wanna feel like</i>
<i>you're about to die?"</i>

424
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,441
<i>[laughter]</i>

425
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,694
<i>"Would you pay 200 dollars to feel like</i>
<i>you're about to die six times?"</i>

426
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:09,695
<i>[laughter]</i>

427
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,406
<i>Why don't you just walk into traffic?</i>

428
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,243
<i>"Did you see that bus almost hit me?</i>
<i>I feel so alive."</i>

429

<i>[laughter]</i>

430
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,040
<i>Why don't you just take off your mask</i>
<i>at a biker rally?</i>

431

<i>-[laughter]</i>
<i>-You know?</i>

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,504
<i>-[cheering and applauding]</i>
<i>-[chuckles]</i>

433
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,634
<i>If you've been zip-lining,</i>
<i>you know to slow down,</i>

434
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,511
<i>you have to spread out your arms and legs.</i>

435
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,804
<i>That supposedly slows you down.</i>

436
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,848
<i>It also makes it look like a suicide.</i>

437
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,099
<i>[laughter]</i>

438
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:42,603
<i>"Oh, if he didn't wanna die,</i>
<i>why was he doing the chalk outline?"</i>

439
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,396
<i>[laughter]</i>

440
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,357
<i>It's such a weird--</i>
<i>How did they even come up with zip-lining?</i>

441
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:50,611
<i>[southern accent] "Hey, you know how</i>
<i>telephone poles have a wire between 'em?"</i>

442
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,280
<i>"What if we just put the tourists</i>
<i>up there?"</i>

443
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,449
<i>[laughter]</i>

444
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:56,742
<i>"Why would tourists do that?"</i>

445
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:59,578
<i>[southern accent] "Don't know.</i>
<i>Why would they pay to swim with sharks?"</i>

446
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,038
<i>[laughter]</i>

447
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,664
<i>[normal voice] We did go snorkeling.</i>

448
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,083
<i>I wasn't worried for myself</i>

449
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,460
<i>'cause I figured sharks would look</i>
<i>at my legs and be like,</i>

00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:07,753
<i>"Those can't be real."</i>

451
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,671
<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

454
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:20,140
<i>Sometimes, when my family</i>
<i>would go to the beach,</i>

455
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,017
<i>I'd go for a hike by myself,</i>

456
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,353
<i>which was boring,</i>
<i>but I figured how to make it fun.</i>

457
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,939
<i>I started bringing a ketchup packet,</i>

458
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,566
<i>and halfway through the hike,</i>
<i>I'd open up the ketchup packet</i>

459
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,401
<i>and rub it on my hands and my face,</i>

460
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,987
<i>then I'd just approach romantic couples.</i>

461
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,447
<i>[laughter]</i>

462
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,074
<i>"Have you seen my wife?"</i>

464
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,411
<i>[stammers] "No."</i>

<i>"But you heard her</i>

00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:47,417
<i>[laughter]</i>

467
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,419
<i>"I can still smell her sin."</i>

<i>we're also processing part</i>
<i>of the pandemic.</i>

475
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,435
<i>We went a year and a half</i>
<i>with no weddings,</i>

<i>no kids' birthday parties,</i>
<i>no family reunions,</i>

<i>-[applause]</i>

<i>Some things-- I don't think</i>
<i>some things are coming back.</i>

482
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,830
<i>Like parades. I think that might</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

484

<i>There was never anything</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

487

<i>[laughter]</i>

489

<i>Before the pandemic,</i>
<i>if you ran into a parade,</i>

<i>you were never like, "Oh, cool, a parade."</i>

<i>of the marching band</i>

501
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,540
<i>is so impressive, right?</i>

502
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,459
<i>But on a street level,</i>
<i>you always felt like</i>

503
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,544
<i>you were being invaded by nerds.</i>

508

<i>They practice as much as the athletes.</i>

509
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,097
<i>They're always rehearsing.</i>

510
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:27,100
<i>It's amazing how much effort goes</i>

<i>The reality is,</i>

<i>It's pretty impressive-- any song,</i>

519

<i>But to me, it just seems like</i>
<i>we're dissuading careers in music.</i>

536
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:38,672
<i>It's like, "Oh, you wanna be</i>

<i>They would march armies into battle,</i>

546
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,363
<i>and they were for morale</i>
<i>and to intimidate the enemy.</i>

547

00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:22,849
<i>And the plastic surgeon said,</i>
<i>"I don't know who that is."</i>

665
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:24,100
<i>[laughter]</i>

666
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,811
<i>And then the kneecap person said,</i>

667
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:31,775
<i>"He's kind of a pale, pudgy guy</i>
<i>who looks like a baby or a cat."</i>

668
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:33,902
<i>[laughter]</i>

669
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,528
<i>That's probably what happened.</i>

670
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,489
<i>[laughter]</i>

671
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:38,990
<i>That's weird.</i>

672
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:43,411
<i>I normally get told I look like</i>
<i>other humans though. I, uh…</i>

673
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,415
<i>In Utah, I always get told I look Mormon.</i>

674
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,001
<i>I didn't even know</i>
<i>you could look like a religion.</i>

675
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,044
<i>[laughter]</i>

676
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:53,088
<i>But apparently, I do.</i>
<i>And I've done research.</i>

677
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,548
<i>I don't look like one of the founders</i>
<i>of the Mormons.</i>

678
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:58,301
<i>I don't look like a present leader</i>
<i>of the Mormons.</i>

679
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:01,471
<i>I don't even look like a guy</i>
<i>who could have more than one wife.</i>

680
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:03,890
<i>[laughter]</i>

681
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:06,184
<i>I just somehow look Mormon. [chuckles]</i>

682
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:07,227
<i>[laughter]</i>

683
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,854
<i>Of course, the Mormons</i>
<i>no longer practice polygamy.</i>

684
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:13,650
<i>But for a while there, a Mormon man</i>
<i>could have more than one wife.</i>

685
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,610
<i>I don't know if that was a selling point.</i>

686
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:16,653
<i>[laughter]</i>

687
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:21,157
<i>'Cause I love my wife, and I can</i>
<i>honestly say I don't want another one.</i>

688
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,785
<i>[laughter]</i>

689
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:26,871
<i>I feel like disappointing one person</i>
<i>is enough.</i>

690
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,623
<i>[laughter]</i>

691
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:32,210
<i>Could you imagine</i>
<i>having two spouses mad at you?</i>

692
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:33,169
<i>[laughter]</i>

693
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:35,380
<i>And you couldn't drink coffee?</i>

694
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,090
<i>[laughter]</i>

695
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:38,383
<i>No, thanks.</i>

696
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:41,052
<i>I hope it doesn't sound like</i>
<i>I'm picking on Mormons.</i>

697
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:44,305
<i>Most organized religions</i>
<i>have negative stereotypes.</i>

698
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,976
<i>Luckily, I'm Catholic, so I don't have</i>
<i>to worry about that, all right.</i>

699
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,018
<i>[laughter]</i>

700
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:54,315
<i>[cheering and applauding]</i>

701
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,943
<i>Sometimes people don't believe me.</i>
<i>Like, "Are you really Catholic?"</i>

702
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:59,237
<i>"No, I'm just saying that to impress you."</i>

703
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,739
<i>[laughter]</i>

704
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:03,324
<i>"I wanna come across like</i>
<i>I have good judgment."</i>

705
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,617
<i>[laughter]</i>

706
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,996
<i>At this point, it's almost like</i>
<i>Catholics are trying to lose followers.</i>

707
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,832
<i>They're like, "What else can we do?</i>
<i>What else?"</i>

708
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:14,210
<i>"Why don't we make Bill Cosby pope?</i>
<i>Let's try that."</i>

709
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,337
<i>[laughter]</i>

710
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:19,632
<i>Catholics have made an art</i>
<i>of shrinking their religion.</i>

711
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:23,636
<i>Even back to the Great Schism of 1054</i>
<i>where the Eastern Orthodox</i>

712
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,555
<i>and the Roman Catholics split apart,</i>

713
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:28,641
<i>the Orthodox were like,</i>
<i>"We wanna celebrate Christmas in January."</i>

714
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:31,227
<i>And the Catholics were like,</i>
<i>"We like pedophiles."</i>

715
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,438
<i>[laughter]</i>

716
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:35,440
<i>I know. That one's hard for me too.</i>

717
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:36,858
<i>[laughter]</i>

718
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:40,195
<i>And then there was</i>
<i>the, uh, Protestant Reformation.</i>

719
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:43,031
<i>You didn't even know</i>
<i>this is a religion history class, did you?</i>

720
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:43,990
<i>[laughter]</i>

721
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:46,868
<i>No, there was the Protestant Reformation</i>
<i>in the 1500s</i>

722
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:51,122
<i>when Martin Luther, who probably thought</i>
<i>he'd be the most famous Martin Luther…</i>

723
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,040
<i>[laughter]</i>

724
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:56,753
<i>Right? He was like, "That's it.</i>
<i>I'm the king of Martin Luthers."</i>

725
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:58,087
<i>[laughter]</i>

726
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:01,007
<i>"Don't be surprised if one day,</i>
<i>I get my own holiday."</i>

727
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,509
<i>[laughter]</i>

728
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:05,512
<i>No, Martin Luther,</i>
<i>he had those 95 problems,</i>

729
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:08,014
<i>but a bitch ain't one, right?</i>

730
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:10,183
<i>[laughter and applause]</i>

731
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:13,144
<i>'Cause at the time,</i>
<i>the Catholic church was super corrupt.</i>

732
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,771
<i>Thankfully, it's not anymore.</i>

733
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:16,689
<i>[laughter]</i>

734
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,483
<i>Some Catholics get really angry.</i>

735
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:21,569
<i>"You're so critical of Catholic church,</i>
<i>why you even Catholic?"</i>

736
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,364
<i>Because I believe human beings</i>
<i>are inherently flawed.</i>

737
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:25,865
<i>That's one of the reasons.</i>

738
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:28,535
<i>But mainly, I'm afraid of my wife.</i>

739
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:31,996
<i>-[laughter]</i>
<i>-Huh?</i>

740
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,707
<i>I don't think there's anything</i>
<i>intrinsically wrong</i>

741
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,125
<i>with organized religion.</i>

742
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:39,629
<i>It's just the human interpretation, right?</i>

743
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:42,507
<i>Most organized religions,</i>
<i>God's saying a similar thing.</i>

744
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,759
<i>He's like,</i>
<i>"I want you to love one another."</i>

745
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:48,972
<i>And the humans are like, "Got it, got it.</i>
<i>He said kill gay people, so…"</i>

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

<i>"Let's get to work."</i>

748
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:58,064
<i>As a result, all organized religions</i>
<i>are struggling right now.</i>

749
00:30:58,147 --> 00:30:59,941
<i>Muslims, they're killing it.</i>

750
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:03,111
<i>Muslims are like, "Oh, Catholics,</i>
<i>you think you can alienate people?"</i>

751
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,821
<i>"Hold my hummus."</i>

<i>"Hey, Jim, you look like</i>

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

757

<i>"What are your views on Judaism?"</i>

00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:20,962
<i>"I'd like to see you destroy</i>

<i>I'll tell you what I think.</i>

761
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,678
<i>I think Judaism is perfect.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

763
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:34,309

<i>[cheering and applauding]</i>

767
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,358
<i>That's some, uh…</i>

768
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:47,697
<i>That's some good old-fashioned</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

770
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:51,075
<i>Really, the only organized religion,</i>

771
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,745
<i>without a negative stereotype,</i>
<i>is Buddhism.</i>

772
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:56,873
<i>Right? You'd think more Americans</i>
<i>would be Buddhists.</i>

773
00:31:56,956 --> 00:32:00,168
<i>'Cause if you look at Buddha,</i>
<i>he kind of looks like an American.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

775
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:05,089

781
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:17,852
<i>You know, in real life, Buddha was thin.</i>
<i>He wasn't even a big guy.</i>

782
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,855
<i>They made him heavy</i>
<i>to make the religion more appealing.</i>

783
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,900
<i>'Cause at that time,</i>
<i>being heavy was a sign of success.</i>

784
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:27,153
<i>Also at that time, being lighter-skinned</i>
<i>was a sign of success.</i>

<i>Right? The hitchhiker and the driver.</i>

847
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,783

1140
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:39,940

<i>"Chopping wood?"</i>

1145
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:56,665
<i>He's like, "Really?"</i>
<i>And I was like, "Don't talk anymore."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

1147
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:03,046

<i>turned it into a stand-up bit.</i>

1148
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:05,841
<i>And I kind of forgot about it.</i>

1149
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:08,468
<i>Then, like a month later, Ricky called me</i>

<i>"I did it. I did it."</i>

00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:14,766
<i>Yeah, he's divorced.</i>

1153
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:17,269
<i>-And…</i>
<i>-[laughter]</i>

1154
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:19,313
<i>Then he immediately starts bragging.</i>

1155
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:23,358
<i>He's like, "Yeah, now, I could throw</i>
<i>an axe 20 yards and hit a bullseye."</i>

1156
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:24,651
<i>I'm like, "That's impressive."</i>

1157
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:27,237
<i>"You know when that's</i>
<i>gonna come in handy? Never."</i>

1158
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:28,322
<i>[laughter]</i>

1159
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:31,408
<i>He'll be like, "Hey, you never know."</i>
<i>I'm like, "No, I do know."</i>

1160
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:33,702
<i>-[laughter]</i>
<i>-[chuckles]</i>

1161
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:38,206
<i>Even if someone broke in your house</i>
<i>and you happen to be holding an axe,</i>

1162
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:42,336
<i>you're not gonna be able to say,</i>
<i>"Hey, can you come 10 feet closer?"</i>

1163
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:44,504
<i>[laughter]</i>

1164
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:51,428
<i>I like having women around</i>
<i>for many reasons,</i>

1165
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:55,140
<i>not least of which is,</i>
<i>they're attractive and men are not.</i>

1166
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:56,266
<i>[laughter]</i>

1167
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,601
<i>You know?</i>

1168
00:48:57,684 --> 00:49:01,271
<i>Like when a guy's good-looking,</i>
<i>it's like a fluke of nature.</i>

1169
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:05,233
<i>And you know what</i>
<i>all attractive men have in common?</i>

1170
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:07,527
<i>They kind of look like women.</i>

1171
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:08,904
<i>[laughter]</i>

1172
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:10,405
<i>Right?</i>

1173
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:13,283
<i>[applause]</i>

1174
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:16,870
<i>That's the only way</i>
<i>straight guys can tell who's good-looking.</i>

1175
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:20,707
<i>"Wow, he must be attractive.</i>
<i>He barely looks like a dude."</i>

1176
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,459
<i>[laughter]</i>

1177
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:29,341
<i>Women are attractive</i>
<i>and compared to men, they're very clean.</i>

1178
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:30,801
<i>Men are gross.</i>

1179
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:34,638
<i>And make very little effort</i>
<i>to not be gross.</i>

1180
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:37,891
<i>Like, if aliens visited Earth,</i>
<i>they'll be so confused.</i>

1181
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:40,268
<i>They'll be like,</i>
<i>"The attractive feminine gender is taking</i>

1182
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:44,398
<i>an hour to get ready</i>
<i>and those hairy beasts are just ready?"</i>

1183
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:46,024
<i>[laughter]</i>

1184
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:48,443
<i>"No wonder this planet's always at war."</i>

1185
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:52,906
<i>Men are gross</i>
<i>and as they get older, grosser.</i>

1186
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,408
<i>[laughter]</i>

1187
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,368
<i>When women get older,</i>
<i>they become more elegant.</i>

1188
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:59,538
<i>As men get older,</i>
<i>they look like they're decomposing.</i>

1189
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:01,248
<i>[laughter]</i>

1190
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:03,125
<i>You ever seen an old guy</i>
<i>with the shirt off?</i>

1191
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:05,293
<i>He looks like the first draft of a human.</i>

1192
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:06,920
<i>[laughter]</i>

1193
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:08,964
<i>What is that, a </i>Simpsons<i> character?</i>

1194
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,843
<i>Because when men get older,</i>
<i>things stop working.</i>

1195
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:14,720
<i>The synapses stop connecting.</i>

1196
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:17,764
<i>Normally, brain's like, "Every month,</i>
<i>I'm gonna grow hair on this guy's head.</i>

1197
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,017
<i>"Every month, I'm gonna grow hair</i>
<i>on this guy's head."</i>

1198
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,351
<i>But one month, the brain's like,</i>

1199
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:25,022
<i>"Every month, I'm gonna grow hair</i>
<i>everywhere but this guy's head."</i>

1200
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:27,524
<i>[laughter]</i>

1201
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:30,694
<i>I have hair growing in parts of my body…</i>

1202
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:32,446
<i>I don't need.</i>

1203
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:33,739
<i>[laughter]</i>

1204
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:37,325
<i>Do you wanna know why older men</i>
<i>grow hair on weird parts of their body?</i>

1205
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:40,454
<i>That's nature's way of saying,</i>
<i>"You're done."</i>

1206
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:42,914
<i>[laughter]</i>

1207
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:46,168
<i>"Stop mating or I'm going to turn you</i>
<i>into a throw rug."</i>

1208
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:48,170
<i>[laughter]</i>

1209
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:51,590
<i>I have some body hair,</i>
<i>not as bad as some men, which is a relief,</i>

1210
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:55,510
<i>'cause as you can see,</i>
<i>I did not win the genetic lottery.</i>

1211
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:57,304
<i>I am bald, blind and pale.</i>

1212
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:00,474
<i>It wouldn't surprise me</i>
<i>if I woke up tomorrow with a tail.</i>

1213
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:03,810
<i>"Have you seen the comic with the tail?"</i>

1214
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:06,730
<i>"He's very pale</i>
<i>and the tail even has a bald spot."</i>

1215
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:09,274
<i>-[audience laughing]</i>
<i>-[Jim chuckles]</i>

1216
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:12,986
<i>I saw a guy this summer at the pool,</i>
<i>he's probably 60, had his shirt off.</i>

1217
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,989
<i>Not a lot of body hair. All body hair.</i>

1218
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:19,701
<i>For a second, I thought they were</i>
<i>shooting a GEICO commercial.</i>

1219
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:21,203
<i>[laughter]</i>

1220
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:22,120
<i>This guy was--</i>

1221
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:25,832
<i>He was so hairy I had to stop</i>
<i>my youngest son from trying to pet him.</i>

1222
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,292
<i>[laughter]</i>

1223
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:29,377
<i>"Let him smell your hand first, son."</i>

1224
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:31,088
<i>[laughter]</i>

1225
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:34,257
<i>This guy was hairy and he was walking</i>
<i>around the pool with the confidence</i>

1226
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:37,427
<i>like he'd spent a lifetime dealing</i>
<i>with hairy situations.</i>

1227
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:38,637
<i>[laughter]</i>

1228
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,889
<i>No one said anything,</i>
<i>but everyone had the same thought:</i>

1229
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:43,016
<i>"Please don't go in the pool."</i>

1230
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,726
<i>[laughter]</i>

1231
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:47,562
<i>"No one's prepared to see you shake dry."</i>

1232
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:51,733
<i>[laughter]</i>

1233
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:54,945
<i>And this man walked right by everyone,</i>

1234
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:57,447
<i>and he sat down next</i>
<i>to an attractive woman.</i>

1235
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:58,573
<i>And I was so impressed.</i>

1236
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:04,788
<i>That woman could look beyond this man's</i>
<i>appearance and focus solely on his wallet.</i>

1237
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:06,373
<i>[laughter]</i>

1238
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,333
<i>[man] Whoo!</i>

1239
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:11,419
<i>But we all wanna be good-looking, right?</i>

1240
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,713
<i>We all wanna be chased</i>
<i>on the playground, right?</i>

1241
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:16,925
<i>Some people go so far</i>
<i>as to get plastic surgery.</i>

1242
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:19,219
<i>They're like,</i>
<i>"Oh, I don't wanna sound desperate,</i>

1243
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:21,221
<i>but can you take a knife to my face?"</i>

1244
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:22,347
<i>[laughter]</i>

1245
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:25,016
<i>[screaming] "And make me pretty.</i>
<i>Just keep cutting!"</i>

1246
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,102
<i>[laughter]</i>

1247
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:31,648
<i>It's kind of amazing more of us</i>
<i>don't get plastic surgery</i>

1248
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:34,442
<i>because we live in</i>
<i>a beauty-obsessed society, right?</i>

1249
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:36,528
<i>There are studies.</i>
<i>There was a Harvard study,</i>

1250
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:40,615
<i>that found that children believed</i>
<i>good-looking people are nicer.</i>

1251
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:43,451
<i>That study also found</i>
<i>that children are stupid.</i>

1252
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:46,371
<i>[laughter]</i>

1253
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:49,291
<i>We definitely give good-looking people</i>
<i>the benefit of the doubt.</i>

1254
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:51,710
<i>Like if a really attractive</i>
<i>person's quiet,</i>

1255
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:53,420
<i>we think they're mysterious.</i>

1256
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:57,340
<i>If a fat person is quiet, we assume</i>
<i>they're thinking about food.</i>

1257
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:58,925
<i>[laughter]</i>

1258
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:01,344
<i>And we are, we are,</i>
<i>but there's still a mystery.</i>

1259
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:03,263
<i>You don't know what kind of food.</i>

1260
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:04,431
<i>[laughter]</i>

1261
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:06,808
<i>All right, it's cake. It's always cake.</i>

1262
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:09,311
<i>But you don't know what kind.</i>
<i>All right, it's red velvet.</i>

1263
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:11,104
<i>[laughter]</i>

1264
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:14,441
<i>As a result, we just like being</i>
<i>around beautiful people.</i>

1265
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:15,734
<i>You ever been out to eat</i>

1266
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:18,195
<i>and you have a waiter or waitress</i>
<i>that's really attractive?</i>

1267
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:21,114
<i>For a second, you're like,</i>
<i>"Wow, this is gonna be a good meal."</i>

1268
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:23,325
<i>[laughter]</i>

1269
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:26,203
<i>You ever have an ugly waiter,</i>
<i>you're like, "Should we leave?"</i>

1270
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:27,579
<i>[laughter]</i>

1271
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:29,289
<i>I think that's why buffets started.</i>

1272
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:31,625
<i>"You know what, I'll get my own food.</i>
<i>Thank you."</i>

1273
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:35,629
<i>"I don't need that mug near my entrée.</i>
<i>You know what I mean?"</i>

1274
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:36,755
<i>[laughter]</i>

1275
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:39,466
<i>"Jim, you're a monster."</i>

1276
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:45,013
<i>We follow good-looking people</i>
<i>on social media, Instagram.</i>

1277
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:47,265
<i>Beautiful people have</i>
<i>millions of followers</i>

1278
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:51,019
<i>and we like their photos</i>
<i>and sometimes, we put a flame emoji.</i>

1279
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:53,730
<i>It's totally socially acceptable.</i>
<i>[chuckles]</i>

1280
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:56,191
<i>If you did that in real life,</i>
<i>you'd go to jail.</i>

1281
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:58,735
<i>-[laughter]</i>
<i>-"Excuse me, sir, what are you doing?"</i>

1282
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:00,612
<i>"I'm following that lady."</i>

1283
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:02,030
<i>[laughter]</i>

1284
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:04,824
<i>"Uh, Can I ask why?"</i>
<i>"I like to look at her."</i>

1285
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,243
<i>[laughter]</i>

1286
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:08,495
<i>"Can you give her this torch</i>
<i>I brought her?"</i>

1287
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:10,997
<i>[laughter]</i>

1288
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,958
<i>"And these prayer hands."</i>

1289
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:15,418
<i>[laughter]</i>

1290
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:18,505
<i>Everyone's got to settle down</i>
<i>with the prayer hands emoji.</i>

1291
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:21,925
<i>The overuse is ridiculous. [chuckles]</i>

1292
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:24,302
<i>Got a text from a friend,</i>
<i>"See you at dinner. Prayer hands."</i>

1293
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:26,429
<i>[laughter]</i>

1294
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:29,766
<i>"No. No prayer hands.</i>
<i>Are you not gonna make it?"</i>

1295
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:32,102
<i>[laughter]</i>

1296
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:35,480
<i>"What are you suggesting?</i>
<i>That we eat hands for dinner?"</i>

1297
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:39,317
<i>My wife is very good-looking.</i>

1298
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:41,528
<i>That's right, I'm part of a mixed couple.</i>

1299
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:43,154
<i>[laughter]</i>

1300
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:44,656
<i>It's not fair. She's good-looking,</i>

1301
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:47,075
<i>she's smart, she's creative.</i>
<i>But you know what?</i>

1302
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:48,785
<i>Horrible taste in men.</i>

1303
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:50,829
<i>[laughter]</i>

1304
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:53,206
<i>So it evens out. I'm happily married,</i>

1305
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:56,543
<i>but I would say, once a week,</i>
<i>I catch my wife giving me a look, like,</i>

1306
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:58,378
<i>"I'm gonna have to let you go."</i>

1307
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:00,171
<i>[laughter]</i>

1308
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:03,216
<i>'Cause I disappoint her constantly.</i>

1309
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,509
<i>I do things that annoy.</i>

1310
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:06,970
<i>Like, here's something I do</i>
<i>that annoys my wife.</i>

1311
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:08,763
<i>I use the bathroom.</i>

1312
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:10,724
<i>[laughter]</i>

1313
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:13,059
<i>I know. I shouldn't, right?</i>

1314
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:17,772
<i>I get in trouble for not telling her</i>
<i>I'm gonna use the bathroom.</i>

1315
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:21,234
<i>"You just disappeared. Where'd you go?"</i>

1316
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,486
<i>[laughter]</i>

1317
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,697
<i>"I didn't know I needed a hall pass."</i>

1318
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,365
<i>[laughter]</i>

1319
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:31,703
<i>I also get in trouble for telling her</i>
<i>I'm gonna use the bathroom.</i>

1320
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:33,538
<i>"Uh, I'm gonna use the bathroom."</i>

1321
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:34,789
<i>"Again?"</i>

1322
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:36,333
<i>[continuous laughter]</i>

1323
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:38,585
<i>"Are you okay?"</i>

1324
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:42,005
<i>"How many times is that today?"</i>

1325
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:44,799
<i>"You're disgusting."</i>

1326
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,594
<i>"What do you do in there?"</i>

1327
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:48,928
<i>"Mostly get away from you."</i>

1328
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:52,182
<i>[laughter]</i>

1329
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:55,268
<i>When my wife's annoyed with me,</i>
<i>she doesn't give me the silent treatment.</i>

1330
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:58,897
<i>She'll just take too long</i>
<i>to answer a simple question.</i>

1331
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:02,442
<i>She'll be standing a foot away,</i>
<i>looking at her phone and I'll be like,</i>

1332
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:05,278
<i>"What time do we have to do that</i>
<i>school thing?" And she'll just be like…</i>

1333
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:13,787
<i>[laughter]</i>

1334
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:22,504
<i>[laughter]</i>

1335
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:25,673
<i>-[sighs]</i>
<i>-[laughter]</i>

1336
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:28,343
<i>"It's in the calendar."</i>

1337
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:29,844
<i>[laughter]</i>

1338
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:35,016
<i>[cheering, applauding]</i>

1339
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:39,854
<i>I'll be like, "Uh, are you mad at me?"</i>

1340
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:45,443
<i>[laughter]</i>

1341
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:53,827
<i>-[sighs]</i>
<i>-[laughter]</i>

1342
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:57,997
<i>"No."</i>

1343
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:00,500
<i>[laughter]</i>

1344
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:03,962
<i>[Jim chuckles]</i>

1345
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:08,341
<i>Recently, we learned that this couple that</i>
<i>we're friends with are getting a divorce.</i>

1346
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:11,261
<i>And not surprisingly,</i>
<i>my wife was very upset.</i>

1347
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:12,429
<i>With me.</i>

1348
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:14,347
<i>[laughter]</i>

1349
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:17,725
<i>I wasn't surprised</i>
<i>'cause this wasn't the first time</i>

1350
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:21,020
<i>something I had nothing to do with</i>
<i>was my fault.</i>

1351
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:22,397
<i>[laughter]</i>

1352
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,525
<i>Trump's election, the Kavanaugh hearings,</i>
<i>that was my fault.</i>

1353
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:29,779
<i>And I apologize 'cause</i>
<i>I unconsciously planned the whole thing.</i>

1354
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:30,780
<i>[laughter]</i>

1355
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:34,534
<i>Now, I would never describe my wife</i>
<i>as crazy, 'cause I like to be married.</i>

1356
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:37,704
<i>But I do think it's interesting</i>

1357
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:41,624
<i>that if a man calls another man crazy,</i>
<i>it's a compliment.</i>

1358
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:44,210
<i>"Here's my buddy, Joey. He's crazy."</i>

1359
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:46,880
<i>Joey's like, "Oh, you're just being nice."</i>

1360
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:48,256
<i>[laughter]</i>

1361
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:51,092
<i>But if I was like,</i>
<i>"This is my wife, Jeannie. She's crazy."</i>

1362
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:54,304
<i>[laughter]</i>

1363
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:56,389
<i>I even get nervous saying that.</i>

1364
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:59,309
<i>[laughter]</i>

1365
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:01,269
<i>[cheering, applauding]</i>

1366
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:02,395
<i>[grunts]</i>

1367
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:06,816
<i>She's back in New York,</i>
<i>but you never know. [chuckles]</i>

1368
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:07,942
<i>[laughter]</i>

1369
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:09,569
<i>'Cause if my wife was standing here</i>

1370
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:11,446
<i>and I was like,</i>
<i>"This is my wife, she's crazy,"</i>

1371
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:13,781
<i>I'd be dead.</i>

1372
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:15,074
<i>[laughter]</i>

1373
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:16,451
<i>And all of you would applaud.</i>

1374
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:19,037
<i>You'd be like,</i>
<i>"Well, that was a teachable moment. Yeah."</i>

1375
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,830
<i>[laughter, applause]</i>

1376
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:24,959
<i>"We learned something."</i>

1377
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:26,711
<i>No, we're hanging in there.</i>

1378
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:29,172
<i>By the way,</i>
<i>if at the start of the pandemic,</i>

1379
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:30,507
<i>you were in a relationship</i>

1380
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:34,677
<i>and you're still in that relationship,</i>
<i>you should get money, right?</i>

1381
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:35,637
<i>[laughter]</i>

1382
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:37,388
<i>Right?</i>

1383
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:39,265
<i>[applause]</i>

1384
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,267
<i>Because before the pandemic,</i>

1385
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:44,521
<i>if you'd hear of a couple splitting up,</i>
<i>you were like, "Oh, no."</i>

1386
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:46,773
<i>But during the pandemic,</i>
<i>when you'd hear of a break up,</i>

1387
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:48,733
<i>you're like, "Oh, of course."</i>

1388
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:51,236
<i>[laughter]</i>

1389
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:53,905
<i>You felt for the couples</i>
<i>that stayed together.</i>

1390
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:56,991
<i>"You're still together?</i>
<i>Oh, I'm sorry to hear that."</i>

1391
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:58,576
<i>[laughter]</i>

1392
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,078
<i>"Co-dependency, huh?"</i>

1393
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:04,916
<i>'Cause it doesn't matter</i>
<i>how strong your relationship was.</i>

1394
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:07,335
<i>At one point during the pandemic,</i>

1395
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:11,464
<i>you looked at your partner and thought,</i>
<i>"I think I'd rather have the coronavirus."</i>

1396
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:14,175
<i>[laughter]</i>

1397
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:17,345
<i>I know that sounds horrible,</i>
<i>but it's true.</i>

1398
00:59:17,428 --> 00:59:18,638
<i>[laughter]</i>

1399
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:20,390
<i>Everyone had that moment</i>
<i>where they're like,</i>

1400
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:22,600
<i>"You know, how uncomfortable</i>
<i>is that ventilator?"</i>

1401
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:24,310
<i>[laughter]</i>

1402
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:25,770
<i>"I know I wouldn't be able to talk,</i>

1403
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:28,106
<i>but does that mean</i>
<i>I wouldn't be able to hear her?"</i>

1404
00:59:28,189 --> 00:59:29,857
<i>[laughter]</i>

1405
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:32,485
<i>"Do they have a ventilator</i>
<i>just for the ears?"</i>

1406
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:33,653
<i>[laughter]</i>

1407
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:35,655
<i>"Jim, you're a monster."</i>

1408
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:38,866
<i>My wife's an amazing mother.</i>

1409
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:41,369
<i>We have five children.</i>
<i>Can you believe that?</i>

1410
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:43,037
<i>-Five children. Thank you.</i>
<i>-[cheering]</i>

1411
00:59:44,163 --> 00:59:45,206
<i>Thank you.</i>

1412
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:47,333
<i>It is something I regret…</i>

1413
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:49,294
<i>[laughter]</i>

1414
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:50,878
<i>…'cause there's too many of them.</i>

1415
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:52,672
<i>There's way too many.</i>

1416
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:55,842
<i>Sometimes at dinner, I just pretend</i>
<i>I'm hosting a reality show…</i>

1417
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:56,759
<i>[laughter]</i>

1418

<i>…called </i>So You Think

1419
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:01,222
<i>[laughter]</i>

1420
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:03,182
<i>'Cause they all can't go.</i>

01:00:04,225 --> 01:00:06,769
<i>They all can't go,</i>

1423
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:12,275
<i>I'm kidding.</i>
<i>Obviously, I'm not getting the boat…</i>

1424
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:14,402
<i>not until I get a motorcycle, you know.</i>

1425

<i>My kids find me annoying.</i>

1427

<i>All children find their parents annoying,</i>

1428
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:25,997
<i>which is kind of ironic, given children</i>
<i>essentially ruined their parents' lives.</i>

1429

<i>-[laughter]</i>
<i>-Right? [chuckles]</i>

1430
01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:30,627

<i>their energy and their money,</i>

1432
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:36,257
<i>and we repay our parents with resentment.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

1434
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:40,303
<i>Have you ever seen an adult get</i>
<i>a phone call from one of their parents?</i>

1435
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:42,388
<i>You'd think it was a debt collector.</i>

1436
01:00:43,222 --> 01:00:44,974
<i>"Ugh. It's my mom."</i>

1437

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

1445
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:15,505
<i>No, I would never suggest that children</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

1447

<i>[laughter]</i>

1449

<i>"How can I get them to pray tomorrow?"</i>

<i>But it's an insane proposition.</i>

1454
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:38,236
<i>You give your children everything.</i>

1455
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:41,280
<i>You give them everything</i>
<i>and then just one day, they leave.</i>

1456
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,741
<i>They're like,</i>
<i>"See you! Thanks for nothing."</i>

1457

<i>[laughter]</i>

1458

01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:59,048
<i>They just stick around.</i>
<i>They turn into roommates.</i>

1462

<i>[laughter]</i>

1463
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:01,342
<i>Not going to happen in my house.</i>

1464

<i>I already have a backpack</i>
<i>for each of them.</i>

1465
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:05,680
<i>They've seen the bags, "What's that?"</i>

1466
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:08,474
<i>I'm like, "When you turn 18,</i>

<i>My big plan</i>

1498

<i>"Do you want to sell posters</i>

1544

<i>[laughter]</i>

1553

<i>Any parent will tell you that, like,</i>

<i>It's exposed them to things</i>
<i>they never thought they'd do.</i>

1559
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,518
<i>Like kids just-- You end up doing things</i>

1560
01:06:20,601 --> 01:06:22,728

<i>"Oh, Tommy's coming over?</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

1574
01:06:58,097 --> 01:07:00,975
<i>I wasn't prepared</i>

<i>You pick up your kid and bring them</i>

1576

<i>And if they don't have an activity,</i>

1577
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:08,983
<i>you have to think of one,</i>
<i>or they'll smoke meth.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

1579
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:14,488
<i>You're always looking</i>
<i>for an activity as a parent.</i>

1580
01:07:14,572 --> 01:07:17,742
<i>I took my kids</i>
<i>to </i>Ripley's Believe It or Not.

<i>[laughter]</i>

1583
01:07:22,121 --> 01:07:24,165
<i>What can I tell you</i>
<i>about </i>Ripley's Believe It or Not?

1584
01:07:24,248 --> 01:07:26,208
<i>It's mostly not.</i>

1585
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:28,335
<i>[laughter]</i>

1586
01:07:28,419 --> 01:07:32,131
<i>It's not interesting.</i>
<i>It's not even a lot of stuff.</i>

1587
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:36,093
<i>It's like they just emptied out</i>
<i>some drifter's storage unit.</i>

1589

<i>Most businesses attempt</i>
<i>to establish trust with the customer.</i>

1591

<i>Not Ripley's.</i>

1592
01:07:45,853 --> 01:07:48,731
<i>Like, "Believe it… or not.</i>
<i>We don't care."</i>

1593

<i>[laughter]</i>

1594

1596
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:58,616
<i>I'm still getting used</i>
<i>to having teenagers.</i>

1597
01:07:58,699 --> 01:08:02,328
<i>Recently, my 17-year-old daughter</i>
<i>told me that she wants to be an actor,</i>

1598
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:04,955
<i>which is so crazy</i>
<i>'cause when I was that age,</i>

1599
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:07,833
<i>that movie</i>
Dead Poets Society<i> came out,</i>

1600
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:10,377
<i>which is an amazing movie</i>
<i>with Robin Williams,</i>

1601
01:08:10,461 --> 01:08:15,216
<i>where he plays this teacher who inspires</i>
<i>these students to seize the day, right?</i>

1602
01:08:15,299 --> 01:08:18,427
<i>And one of the students wants</i>
<i>to be an actor.</i>

1603
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:22,014
<i>And, you know, he joins the play</i>
<i>and he invites his dad to see the play</i>

1604
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:24,642
<i>and after the play, he tells his dad</i>
<i>that he wants to be an actor.</i>

1605
01:08:24,725 --> 01:08:27,978
<i>Dad's like, "You're not gonna be an actor,</i>
<i>that's stupid. Waste of time and money…"</i>

1606
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:28,938
<i>[grunts]</i>

1607
01:08:29,021 --> 01:08:31,482
<i>The kid's so distraught he kills himself,</i>

1608
01:08:31,565 --> 01:08:34,902
<i>and then the teacher gets fired</i>
<i>and all the kids stand on desks…</i>

1609
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:39,406
<i>[laughter]</i>

1610
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:41,325
<i>Anyway, it's a great movie.</i>

1611
01:08:41,408 --> 01:08:42,618
<i>[laughter]</i>

1612
01:08:42,701 --> 01:08:47,331
<i>No, now… now that I'm the parent</i>
<i>of a teenager,</i>

1613
01:08:47,414 --> 01:08:52,628
<i>I realized that dad</i>
<i>in </i>Dead Poets Society<i> was right.</i>

1614
01:08:52,711 --> 01:08:54,797
<i>[laughter]</i>

1615
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:58,509
<i>I'm kidding. I know the point</i>
<i>of the movie is, "Don't be a teacher."</i>

1616
01:08:58,592 --> 01:09:00,761
<i>[laughter]</i>

1617
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:05,975
<i>My wife hates that joke so much.</i>

1618
01:09:06,058 --> 01:09:07,476
<i>[laughter]</i>

1619
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,061
<i>My kids, I don't know what they think.</i>

1620
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:11,564
<i>I don't even think my kids know</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

1622
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:16,485
<i>Or I should say I didn't think</i>
<i>they knew what I did for a living</i>

1623
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:18,445
<i>till last Halloween.</i>

1624
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:21,448
<i>My 10-year-old, Michael, didn't know</i>
<i>what he wanted to be for Halloween,</i>

1625
01:09:21,532 --> 01:09:23,117
<i>which is a crisis.</i>

1626
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,327
<i>If you're a parent, you know this.</i>

1627
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:28,038
<i>Then, like, two days before Halloween,</i>
