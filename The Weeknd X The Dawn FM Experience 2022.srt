[Jim Carrey] You’re tuned to Dawn FM

385
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:38,671
The middle of
nowhere on your dial

386
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:42,508
So sit back and unpack

387
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:45,135
You may be here awhile

388
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:48,472
Now that all future plans
have been postponed

389
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,098
And it’s time to look back

390
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:51,767
on the things you
thought you owned

391
00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:53,226
Do you remember them well?

392
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:56,855
Were you high
or just stoned?

393
00:30:56,896 --> 00:31:00,276
And how many grudges did
you take to your grave?

394
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:03,570
When you weren’t liked or
followed, how did you behave?

395
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:07,074
Was it often a dissonant
chord you were strumming?

396
00:31:07,116 --> 00:31:11,828
Were you ever in tune with
the song life was humming?

397
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:14,956
If pain’s living on
when your body’s long gone

398
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:18,042
And your phantom regret
hasn’t let it go yet

399
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:21,547
You may not have died
in the way that you must

400
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:25,091
All specters are haunted
by their own lack of trust

401
00:31:25,134 --> 00:31:28,177
When you’re all out of time,
there’s nothing but space

402
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,013
No hunting, no gathering

403
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,889
No nations, no race

404
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:35,685
And Heaven is closer than
those tears on your face

405
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:38,146
When the purple rain falls

406
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:40,441
We are all bathed
in it’s grace

407
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,821
Heaven’s for those
who let go of regret

408
00:31:46,864 --> 00:31:51,659
And you have to wait here
when you’re not all there yet

409
00:31:51,702 --> 00:31:54,997
But you could be there
by the end of this song

410
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,041
Where The Weeknd’s so good
and he plays all week long

411
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:01,170
Bang a gong, get it on

412
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:08,594
And if your broken heart’s heavy
when you step on the scale

413
00:32:08,636 --> 00:32:11,930
You’ll be lighter than air
when they pull back the veil

414
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:15,392
Consider the flowers,
they don’t try to look right

415
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:18,770
They just open their petals
and turn to the light

416
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,107
Are you listening real close?

417
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:24,652
Heaven’s not that, it’s this

418
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:26,486
It’s the depth of this moment

419
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:29,239
You don’t reach for bliss

420
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,617
God knows life is chaos

421
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:35,370
But He made one thing true

422
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:37,455
You gotta unwind your mind

423
00:32:37,498 --> 00:32:39,500
Train your soul to align

424
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:43,378
And dance til you find
that divine boogaloo

425
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,966
In other words

426
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:57,350
You gotta be Heaven,
to see Heaven

427
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:02,522
May peace be with you
