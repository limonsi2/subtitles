00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:27,667
Ah!

6
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:37,200
Bella, your pronunciation
is getting molto bene.

7
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,533
Okay, so, spaghetti.

8
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:40,533
Chicken parm.

9
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:42,066
Extra spaghetti.

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,066
Extra-

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,066
Mama Tucci, this is too much.

12
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,667
Nah, there's no such thing.

13
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,667
Well, I'll have plenty of
leftovers for my coworkers.

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,700
Good.

15
00:00:49,834 --> 00:00:50,834
Are you sure you don't
mind watching Amy again?

16
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,166
No, it's my pleasure.

17
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,700
I promise I won't be too late.

18
00:00:53,834 --> 00:00:55,667
Bye, pumpkin.
- Bye, Dad.

19
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,233
Oh, my Amy.

20
00:00:58,367 --> 00:01:00,400
You're such a strong girl.

21
00:01:00,533 --> 00:01:01,467
Just like you, Mama.

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,233
Ah!

23
00:01:03,367 --> 00:01:04,433
Uh!

24
00:01:04,567 --> 00:01:05,633
So we're gonna
make the primavera?

25
00:01:05,767 --> 00:01:06,900
- Yeah.
- Okay.

26
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:08,400
Let's get cooking!

27
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:10,400
Grazie!

28
00:01:12,767 --> 00:01:15,800
Woo!

29
00:01:15,934 --> 00:01:17,066
Cool, Mama.

30
00:01:33,567 --> 00:01:34,934
Welcome, everyone.

31
00:01:35,066 --> 00:01:36,533
Hello. Good evening.

32
00:01:37,934 --> 00:01:41,633
So, for those of you who
are new here tonight,

33
00:01:41,767 --> 00:01:45,900
Family Dinner Fridays is
a tradition that my nonna

34
00:01:46,033 --> 00:01:49,633
started back in
Napali way back when.

35
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,266
She would invite the
entire neighborhood

36
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,100
to come and share a meal.

37
00:01:55,233 --> 00:01:59,133
So to continue her
legacy and honor Nonna,

38
00:01:59,266 --> 00:02:04,300
we welcome you to our
Friday Night Supper Club.

39
00:02:05,266 --> 00:02:06,800
We care about our customers.

40
00:02:06,934 --> 00:02:08,700
We treat you like family.

41
00:02:08,834 --> 00:02:11,333
So you're a part of
the Tucci family now.

42
00:02:11,467 --> 00:02:13,133
Whether you like it or not.

43
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,700
So.

44
00:02:16,834 --> 00:02:17,967
A Nonna.

45
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,066
- A Nonna.
- A Nonna.

46
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:24,633
Amy?

47
00:02:24,767 --> 00:02:25,767
Amy?

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,133
Earth to Amy, do you copy?

49
00:02:29,266 --> 00:02:30,367
Oh.

50
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,533
I gotta take that
pasta to table nine,

51
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:32,533
unless you want to
stare at it longer?

52
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:34,266
No, no, it's all yours.

53
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,533
I used to be like
that primavera.

54
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:41,967
Bold.

55
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:42,967
Full of life.

56
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,100
Flavor.

57
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,533
What happened to me, Christine?

58
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,033
You're still all those things.

59
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:50,133
You're just stuck in a
rut right now, that's all.

60
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:53,133
How long do I have to toil
away as a mid-level manager

61
00:02:53,266 --> 00:02:55,533
before I finally get
the next opportunity?

62
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:57,000
What if this is it for me?

63
00:02:57,133 --> 00:02:59,200
I'm still singing our
cheesy Happy Birthday songs

64
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:00,934
to customers when I'm 90.

65
00:03:01,066 --> 00:03:02,400
Okay, well, you're
being dramatic.

66
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:04,900
Things don't change
for me around here soon,

67
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:06,433
I'm movin' on.

68
00:03:06,567 --> 00:03:09,400
You decided all that just
by staring at some pasta?

69
00:03:09,533 --> 00:03:11,934
Usually that just
gets me into trouble.

70
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,967
Okay, it wasn't
just the primavera.

71
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,367
Oh.

72
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,433
Mama?

73
00:03:18,567 --> 00:03:19,700
Yeah.

74
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:21,900
We've been playing
phone tag lately.

75
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:23,367
Could really use her
advice right about now.

76
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,867
Well, maybe today's
the day things change.

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,333
Everyone gather round.

78
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,934
As you know, we've been
interviewing applicants

79
00:03:34,066 --> 00:03:36,066
for the permanent
manager position.

80
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,066
I know you've all been anxious
to hear who we've selected.

81
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,033
It's my pleasure to announce

82
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,667
that the honor goes to

83
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:47,033
Benjamin Stewart from our
Upper East Side location.

84
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,200
Let's make sure he feels welcome

85
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,500
when he arrives this afternoon.

86
00:03:49,633 --> 00:03:50,533
Okay, back to work.

87
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:52,433
Thank you.

88
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,600
Hey, Nunzio, table four.

89
00:04:03,734 --> 00:04:05,300
Clean it, please.

90
00:04:05,433 --> 00:04:06,834
De facto.

91
00:04:06,967 --> 00:04:09,100
All right, I dare you to find
me a more perfect tiramisu.

92
00:04:09,233 --> 00:04:10,834
Outside of Italy, that is.

93
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:12,600
Frank, uh, listen,
I know there's a lot

94
00:04:12,734 --> 00:04:13,800
been going on lately,

95
00:04:13,934 --> 00:04:15,934
but you really should
slow down a little.

96
00:04:16,066 --> 00:04:17,166
You really shouldn't
rush your craft,

97
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,767
especially on a day
like today, right?

98
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,800
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

99
00:04:19,934 --> 00:04:20,834
What are you doin'?

100
00:04:20,967 --> 00:04:21,934
What are you?

101
00:04:22,066 --> 00:04:23,133
I'm a server, so
I'm gonna serve.

102
00:04:23,266 --> 00:04:24,633
No, uh, the chef will
deliver the dessert.

103
00:04:24,767 --> 00:04:25,834
Frank, come on.

104
00:04:25,967 --> 00:04:27,300
We really can't afford
a bad review today.

105
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,266
Okay, Kimberly may
be a tough critic,

106
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,100
grant you that, but
there's no way she doesn't

107
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:32,633
fall head over heels
in love with this.

108
00:04:32,767 --> 00:04:34,600
I know, it's nice,
but you know your menu

109
00:04:34,734 --> 00:04:36,567
has its detractors, right?

110
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,600
Ah.

111
00:04:37,734 --> 00:04:39,000
They'll warm up.

112
00:04:39,133 --> 00:04:40,433
Just like that caramel
drizzle if you don't let go.

113
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,000
Thank you.

114
00:04:45,133 --> 00:04:47,266
All right, I'm here.

115
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,333
For dessert, tiramisu di Franco.

116
00:04:51,467 --> 00:04:53,867
Caramel drizzle topping,
dusted with cocoa.

117
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:02,166
I, uh, I just wanted
to thank you again

118
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,200
for making the time to
review our new menu.

119
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,400
I've always had a lot of
respect and admiration

120
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:08,200
for your column in The Times.

121
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:09,734
Hmm.

122
00:05:09,867 --> 00:05:11,900
I'm sorry, was that a hmm?

123
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:13,000
Or a mmm?

124
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,000
It's nothing.

125
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:18,834
No, but if it was
somethin', you could tell me.

126
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,033
Mr. Rossi, I'm not
really supposed to give

127
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,000
feedback before my
review goes live,

128
00:05:24,133 --> 00:05:26,600
but it's a little dry.

129
00:05:29,467 --> 00:05:31,734
I'm sorry.

130
00:05:31,867 --> 00:05:34,333
Did you just cause my
famously moist tiramisu

131
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,834
a little, uh, dry?

132
00:05:36,967 --> 00:05:38,066
Just a touch.

133
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,166
But that's impossible.

134
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,667
Well, it's certainly possible.

135
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,400
I'm sorry, it's just
never has there been a more

136
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:44,900
perfect customer fit for
a more perfect dessert.

137
00:05:45,033 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm just, have another bite.

138
00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:48,667
I think I've sampled enough.

139
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,333
You'll find my review
online later this evening.

140
00:05:51,467 --> 00:05:53,266
And it'll be a
good one, right?

141
00:05:57,633 --> 00:06:00,300
Uh, did I mention
how much I appreciate

142
00:06:00,433 --> 00:06:02,233
and admire you and your column?

143
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:03,567
And she's gone.

144
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:08,734
Ah, don't worry about it.

145
00:06:08,867 --> 00:06:09,934
Really?

146
00:06:10,066 --> 00:06:12,734
I mean worry
about it a little.

147
00:06:12,867 --> 00:06:15,567
Amy, I'd like you to take
Benjamin under your wing,

148
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,900
help him get acclimated.

149
00:06:17,033 --> 00:06:18,433
As the most senior manager here,

150
00:06:18,567 --> 00:06:20,767
I want him in the
most capable hands.

151
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,400
Well, that's what I
wanted to talk to you about.

152
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:25,767
I thought my seniority
would've given me

153
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,633
a leg up on that opportunity.

154
00:06:27,767 --> 00:06:29,533
We'll see what
opens up next year.

155
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:35,633
I made myself a
promise that if I didn't

156
00:06:35,767 --> 00:06:38,467
move up this year,
I would move on,

157
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,033
and I need to keep that promise.

158
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,166
I understand.

159
00:06:43,633 --> 00:06:49,333
You're always welcome back
if you change your mind.

160
00:06:49,467 --> 00:06:50,567
Yup.

161
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,633
Mmm-hmm, I feel liberated.

162
00:06:51,767 --> 00:06:52,633
Yes!

163
00:06:52,767 --> 00:06:53,800
I feel free!

164
00:06:53,934 --> 00:06:57,066
- 'Atta girl!
- I feel so scared.

165
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,633
Oh, you were on such a roll.

166
00:06:58,767 --> 00:07:00,867
I don't have
anything lined up.

167
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,633
But this is what
you've been saving for.

168
00:07:02,767 --> 00:07:06,333
Now you can devote all your
time to unlocking your destiny.

169
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,800
Destiny.

170
00:07:07,934 --> 00:07:08,800
All right.

171
00:07:08,934 --> 00:07:10,300
Yeah, there's some confidence.

172
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,133
Is that destiny calling already?

173
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:15,800
Hello?

174
00:07:15,934 --> 00:07:17,533
Amy Lamay?

175
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:18,967
David Lewis, attorney.

176
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,533
I know you've been trying
to reach Ms. Tucci.

177
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:25,834
I'm sorry to inform you that
she recently passed away

178
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:27,834
and we need you to
come into our offices

179
00:07:27,967 --> 00:07:30,000
for the reading of her will.

180
00:07:30,133 --> 00:07:31,000
How's Friday?

181
00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:33,000
Yeah. Okay.

182
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:34,533
Friday, I'll be there.

183
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,867
Is everything all right?

184
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,400
Hey, so.

185
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,467
Stop refreshing.

186
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,467
Huh?

187
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,467
I'm not refreshing.

188
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,467
I'm playing solitaire.

189
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,700
Why am I lying to you?

190
00:07:56,834 --> 00:07:57,867
It should be up by now!

191
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,200
So you know, her
rating has nothing to do

192
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:01,367
with all your hard work.

193
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,367
You're right.

194
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,600
I'm, ah, eh, I'm letting go.

195
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:04,667
- Let it go!
- I'm keeping cool.

196
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,767
It doesn't even.

197
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,767
Whoa, it's up, it's up!

198
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,800
- It's up.
- It's up.

199
00:08:07,934 --> 00:08:09,100
Hey, what does it say?

200
00:08:09,233 --> 00:08:11,266
Chef Frank Rossi largely
abandons the restaurant's

201
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,367
original menu in favor of
some new age Italian fusion.

202
00:08:17,233 --> 00:08:18,367
Nice.

203
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,600
That just isn't
quite there yet.

204
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:22,600
Mmm-mmm.

205
00:08:22,734 --> 00:08:24,266
What's the missing ingredient?

206
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,233
Could be as simple
as a bit more love.

207
00:08:27,367 --> 00:08:28,233
Five forks.

208
00:08:28,367 --> 00:08:29,934
Oh, that's good.

209
00:08:30,066 --> 00:08:31,033
Out of 10 forks.

210
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,266
How do you erase
something from the internet?

211
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,533
What?

212
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:36,367
No, that'll be in
print later this week.

213
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,100
What effect is it
gonna have on business?

214
00:08:38,233 --> 00:08:39,533
Well, uh, you
know, our client base

215
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:41,433
is kind of doing
this a little bit,

216
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:44,533
and Kimberly's articles tend
to make things go like this

217
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,900
or like that.

218
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:50,033
- Okay.
- Yeah.

219
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,433
Okay, no, it's okay.

220
00:08:51,567 --> 00:08:54,266
I can edit the recipes
for a little more flavor.

221
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,533
Or less.

222
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:56,600
Or a little more love.

223
00:08:56,734 --> 00:08:58,433
What does that even mean, Sal?

224
00:08:58,567 --> 00:08:59,934
I-I-I, you know.

225
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:02,166
Maybe she's referring
to your demeanor,

226
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,433
'cause sometimes you can
come across a little brash.

227
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:05,433
Brash?

228
00:09:05,567 --> 00:09:07,600
Bra, uh, it's passion, Sal.

229
00:09:07,734 --> 00:09:08,600
Okay, I'm Italian.

230
00:09:08,734 --> 00:09:09,633
I can't help it. You know this.

231
00:09:09,767 --> 00:09:10,667
Yeah, I do.

232
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,934
Oh, well, maybe this is her

233
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:12,934
calling to change her mind.

234
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:13,934
Hello?

235
00:09:14,066 --> 00:09:15,000
Is this Frank Rossi?

236
00:09:15,133 --> 00:09:16,300
Yeah, this is Frank Rossi.

237
00:09:16,433 --> 00:09:17,834
Maria Tucci
passed away recently.

238
00:09:17,967 --> 00:09:18,834
What?

239
00:09:18,967 --> 00:09:19,834
I'm sorry
for your loss.

240
00:09:19,967 --> 00:09:21,000
Wait. What?

241
00:09:21,133 --> 00:09:22,467
I'm her
attorney David Lewis.

242
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,333
We need you to come in
for a reading of her will.

243
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:25,333
Yeah.

244
00:09:25,467 --> 00:09:26,400
Can you
come in this Friday?

245
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:27,400
Okay, Friday.

246
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:28,400
We'll send
you the details.

247
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:30,500
Thank you.

248
00:09:30,633 --> 00:09:32,500
What is it?

249
00:09:32,633 --> 00:09:33,834
You all right?

250
00:09:33,967 --> 00:09:35,467
I need some air.

251
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,767
Okay.

252
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,867
You okay?

253
00:09:40,033 --> 00:09:40,934
Good morning.

254
00:09:41,066 --> 00:09:42,467
Good morning.

255
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,500
Ah, cappuccino with an extra
splash of espresso, please.

256
00:09:44,633 --> 00:09:46,333
Yeah, you got it.

257
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:48,100
Uh, and a cannoli.

258
00:09:48,233 --> 00:09:49,900
Oh, lucky you.
It's our last one.

259
00:09:50,734 --> 00:09:51,600
I'll take a paper, too.

260
00:09:51,734 --> 00:09:52,700
Sure, thanks.

261
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,166
- Hey.
- Hey.

262
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,767
Can I get a cappuccino
with an extra splash

263
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,834
of espresso, please?

264
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,166
Oh, and a cannoli.

265
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,934
Unfortunately, we just
gave out our last one.

266
00:10:05,066 --> 00:10:06,100
Ah, okay.

267
00:10:06,233 --> 00:10:07,800
Just the cappuccino
then, please.

268
00:10:07,934 --> 00:10:08,934
Yeah.

269
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,133
Couldn't help but
overhear we ordered

270
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:17,667
the exact same drink.

271
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,767
Ah, yeah.

272
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:21,100
Good friend of mine
introduced it to me.

273
00:10:21,233 --> 00:10:23,000
This place, too, actually.

274
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:24,100
Same here.

275
00:10:35,066 --> 00:10:36,934
Chef Frank.

276
00:10:37,066 --> 00:10:37,934
Or Frank.

277
00:10:38,066 --> 00:10:39,433
I don't know why I said that.

278
00:10:39,567 --> 00:10:41,867
I guess I'm just used to
introducing myself that way.

279
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,133
Amy.

280
00:10:44,266 --> 00:10:45,500
What kind of chef are you?

281
00:10:45,633 --> 00:10:47,600
Oh, uh, Italian.

282
00:10:47,734 --> 00:10:49,100
Kind of renowned, actually.

283
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:50,600
Renowned, wow.

284
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:51,800
Ah, just a little.

285
00:10:51,934 --> 00:10:54,166
You know, gotta
stay humble, right?

286
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,767
What line of work
are you in, Amy?

287
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,767
Management.

288
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,767
Oh.

289
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,367
Lack thereof at the moment.

290
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,200
I'm still trying to figure
out my destino right now.

291
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,400
Ah, I see.

292
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:05,400
Yeah.

293
00:11:05,533 --> 00:11:07,834
Destino.

294
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,500
Cannoli.

295
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,033
Uh, you're the, you're
the lucky one who got

296
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,367
the last cannoli.

297
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,600
Yeah.

298
00:11:18,734 --> 00:11:20,567
But lucky isn't how I
describe myself lately.

299
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,667
Wanna split it?

300
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,200
I, uh, I already had half.

301
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,200
Right, yeah, of course.

302
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,333
Why would...

303
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,166
Uh, mind if I just take
a look at the paper?

304
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,233
Gotta check the scores.

305
00:11:32,367 --> 00:11:33,233
Which team?

306
00:11:33,367 --> 00:11:34,233
Yankees.

307
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:35,233
Who else?

308
00:11:35,367 --> 00:11:36,367
It's not baseball season.

309
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,266
That was a joke, Amy.

310
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:41,033
Not one of my best.

311
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,033
You know what?

312
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,233
I've gotta get going, actually,

313
00:11:43,367 --> 00:11:47,166
so the paper and
cannoli are all yours,

314
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,867
renowned chef Frank.

315
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,300
You have a nice day.

316
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,567
Well, nice to meet you.

317
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,533
And she's gone.

318
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,767
So who are we waiting for?

319
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,467
Just one more person.

320
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,400
Sorry I'm late.

321
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,467
Uh, weird chef guy?

322
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,700
Last cannoli girl?

323
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,934
What, you think I'm weird?

324
00:12:17,066 --> 00:12:18,233
How did you know Mama?

325
00:12:18,367 --> 00:12:19,734
I'm head chef
at her restaurant.

326
00:12:19,867 --> 00:12:21,633
I've been practically runnin'
the place the last year.

327
00:12:21,767 --> 00:12:23,233
Wait, how do you know her?

328
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,800
We were close.

329
00:12:24,934 --> 00:12:27,233
We hadn't spoken for awhile.

330
00:12:27,367 --> 00:12:29,367
So you two know each other?

331
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,233
- No.
- Yes!

332
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:32,467
Yeah!

333
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,467
We just met.

334
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,967
Yeah.

335
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,567
Mama wanted you both present
to hear the instructions

336
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,400
laid out in her will.

337
00:12:39,533 --> 00:12:42,400
Amy, I have the utmost
confidence that you will

338
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:46,433
dutifully and faithfully
preside over my life's work.

339
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:48,400
You were like a
granddaughter to me.

340
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:52,633
So, that's why I'm
leaving you my restaurant.

341
00:12:52,767 --> 00:12:55,233
Mama's is now yours.

342
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:56,767
What?

343
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,800
Mama's wish is for Frank
to remain at the restaurant

344
00:12:58,934 --> 00:13:02,200
in his current
capacity as head chef.

345
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:05,200
There is also a
substantial inheritance,

346
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:08,333
predicated on Amy
taking ownership.

347
00:13:08,467 --> 00:13:09,333
Oh.

348
00:13:09,467 --> 00:13:11,166
And

349
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,400
she also left this.

350
00:13:17,767 --> 00:13:18,834
That book.

351
00:13:18,967 --> 00:13:19,834
She never let anyone
else touch this.

352
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:21,200
Wait, wait, that's it?

353
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,300
No other details?

354
00:13:22,433 --> 00:13:24,500
She's left nothing else.

355
00:13:24,633 --> 00:13:27,633
I'm afraid her intentions are
up to your interpretation.

356
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:40,300
Good morning.

357
00:13:40,433 --> 00:13:41,867
Good morning.

358
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,900
Boss.

359
00:13:44,066 --> 00:13:45,000
Boss.

360
00:13:45,133 --> 00:13:46,233
Wow.

361
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,033
You know, I had my own
plans for Mama's where

362
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,467
I'd one day take over,

363
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,967
but I suppose that
just wasn't my destino.

364
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,867
Speaking of which,
is that for me?

365
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,500
Extra splash of
espresso and a cannoli.

366
00:13:58,633 --> 00:13:59,633
Tryin' to butter me up?

367
00:13:59,767 --> 00:14:00,967
It's a peace offering.

368
00:14:01,867 --> 00:14:03,867
Mama was special to both of us,

369
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,433
and she had no other family.

370
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,033
We can make this work.

371
00:14:15,734 --> 00:14:18,367
Enjoy, ladies.

372
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,367
Hey.

373
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,633
Ugh, no more fresh gnocci.

374
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,200
No more gnocci.

375
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,867
Amy, I'm slammed in the kitchen.

376
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,367
I can't believe how busy we are.

377
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,700
I need you to help me.

378
00:14:31,834 --> 00:14:32,700
What? No.

379
00:14:32,834 --> 00:14:34,367
Oh, no, I, I'm just the busser.

380
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,233
No, no, there's no just
anything here at Mama's.

381
00:14:37,367 --> 00:14:40,900
Every role is vital to this
restaurant, you know that.

382
00:14:41,033 --> 00:14:42,633
What's the number one rule?

383
00:14:43,867 --> 00:14:45,100
Work at everything you
do with all your heart,

384
00:14:45,233 --> 00:14:46,367
soul, mind and strength.

385
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,600
Perfect.

386
00:14:47,734 --> 00:14:49,567
You'll learn the rest
of the rules by my side.

387
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,700
Right now you're promoted.

388
00:14:51,834 --> 00:14:53,233
Congratulations.

389
00:14:53,367 --> 00:14:54,266
Okay.

390
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,333
There's your first customer.

391
00:14:56,467 --> 00:14:58,066
Smile.

392
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,233
Benvenuti.

393
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:00,767
Welcome to Mama's.

394
00:15:08,734 --> 00:15:10,834
What did you do to Mama's?

395
00:15:13,633 --> 00:15:14,767
Sales have dipped.

396
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,266
Tiny dip.

397
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,800
Itty bitty, in technical terms.

398
00:15:17,934 --> 00:15:20,500
No plans, repairs or updates.

399
00:15:20,633 --> 00:15:21,500
I got those plans.

400
00:15:21,633 --> 00:15:23,767
Just right up here.

401
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,834
The menu's completely changed.

402
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:25,967
Where are Mama's dishes?

403
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,600
We're still working
out the kinks.

404
00:15:27,734 --> 00:15:29,166
We just need new, uh-

405
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,600
Everything?

406
00:15:30,734 --> 00:15:33,266
Okay, we're in the
middle of an upgrade, okay?

407
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,133
Look, things have
been kind of crazy

408
00:15:35,266 --> 00:15:37,633
ever since Mama slowed
down and stepped back

409
00:15:37,767 --> 00:15:39,266
from her duties last year.

410
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,800
Obviously I'm not much
of an interior decorator,

411
00:15:41,934 --> 00:15:44,100
but I do make a mean tiramisu.

412
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:46,934
All right, I come from
a big corporate franchise,

413
00:15:47,066 --> 00:15:48,500
and I've developed a
system that will help

414
00:15:48,633 --> 00:15:49,767
fix all of these issues.

415
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,166
And then once Mama's is
back in decent shape,

416
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,500
we can both move on.

417
00:15:54,633 --> 00:15:55,667
Oh, wait.

418
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,367
So you're not
planning on staying?

419
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:04,834
Financials, attendance,
scheduling, trust.

420
00:16:04,967 --> 00:16:06,500
The FAST system.

421
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:07,500
Yeah, I got my own system.

422
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,834
It's called DIY.

423
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:09,834
Mmm.

424
00:16:09,967 --> 00:16:12,734
DIY hasn't been W-O-R-K-ing.

425
00:16:12,867 --> 00:16:14,233
Yes, acronym
thing's real cute.

426
00:16:14,367 --> 00:16:15,667
Definitely won't
get on my nerves.

427
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,567
What is that?

428
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,734
Oh, that is Galaxy Blast.

429
00:16:19,867 --> 00:16:22,667
Just the greatest
arcade game of all time.

430
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,900
Wanna play?

431
00:16:24,033 --> 00:16:25,567
Mama's classic
Italian restaurant

432
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,033
now features Galaxy Blast?

433
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,400
Yeah.

434
00:16:29,533 --> 00:16:31,133
Okay, I'm shutting this down.

435
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,834
What?

436
00:16:33,967 --> 00:16:36,066
Mama's needs a total refresh.

437
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,734
But you know, with the
inheritance she left,

438
00:16:38,867 --> 00:16:41,433
I think we can really bring
this place back to life.

439
00:16:42,967 --> 00:16:45,367
You're the boss.

440
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,734
What should we do with this?

441
00:16:46,867 --> 00:16:49,166
I'm not sure if she left
it for you or for me.

442
00:16:51,633 --> 00:16:52,500
You know what?

443
00:16:52,633 --> 00:16:53,633
Uh.

444
00:16:54,867 --> 00:16:57,066
It's all yours.

445
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,533
Ooh, biscotti.

446
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:08,934
Mmm-hmm.

447
00:17:09,066 --> 00:17:10,433
I figured some Italian
desserts would be a good way

448
00:17:10,567 --> 00:17:11,867
to break the ice
with the employees

449
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,533
of your Italian restaurant.

450
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,767
My restaurant.

451
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,567
Nothing daunting
about those words.

452
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,066
It's kind of funny,
though, isn't it?

453
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,600
You just quit your job at Chow,

454
00:17:21,734 --> 00:17:24,200
and then this opportunity
falls right into your lap.

455
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,400
Destino.

456
00:17:25,533 --> 00:17:27,266
Oh, I don't know
about destino.

457
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,200
Why, what do you mean?

458
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,033
I know I should
do what Mama wants.

459
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:33,233
It's just that I don't know
that I can do her legacy

460
00:17:33,367 --> 00:17:35,367
justice if I stay
long-term, you know?

461
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,600
She-she put her heart
and soul into that place,

462
00:17:38,734 --> 00:17:43,700
and if I fail at this, then
I, you know, I fail her.

463
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:46,200
Hey, you won't fail her.

464
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,200
You've never failed
her before, right?

465
00:17:50,734 --> 00:17:52,767
Right.

466
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:56,066
So, Frankie,
how you feelin'?

467
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,867
I think I'm still in
the anger stage of grief.

468
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,867
Miss her.

469
00:18:00,066 --> 00:18:01,166
Yeah, me too.

470
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,000
It's a lot to take
in all at once.

471
00:18:03,133 --> 00:18:04,433
But you know, we're
gonna get through this.

472
00:18:04,567 --> 00:18:05,433
I know.

473
00:18:05,567 --> 00:18:07,767
You know what's funny?
- What?

474
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,800
I ran into Amy at
Destino's before we went

475
00:18:09,934 --> 00:18:10,834
to the lawyer.

476
00:18:10,967 --> 00:18:12,100
Uh-huh.

477
00:18:12,233 --> 00:18:13,133
Think she was
flirting with me.

478
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:14,600
Really?

479
00:18:14,734 --> 00:18:16,000
That's a good thing you
didn't flirt back with her.

480
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:19,000
That would make things a
little interesting around here.

481
00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:20,667
Yeah, it's...

482
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,667
Oh no.

483
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,767
You flirted with her, didn't ya?

484
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,967
I don't think she noticed.

485
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,333
I'm about as smooth
as a pine cone.

486
00:18:25,467 --> 00:18:26,934
Plus, we got the stresses
of this situation

487
00:18:27,066 --> 00:18:27,934
distracting us.

488
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:28,934
Yeah, about that.

489
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,166
What's your plan?

490
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,467
Well, Mama made
one thing clear.

491
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,266
She wants me to stay.

492
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,433
Truth is, I don't know if I can.

493
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,767
Hi, everybody. I'm Amy.

494
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,266
I'm the new owner and manager,

495
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,934
and I've brought you biscotti.

496
00:18:47,066 --> 00:18:48,600
My best friend
Christine made them.

497
00:18:48,734 --> 00:18:49,934
Dig in.

498
00:18:50,066 --> 00:18:52,166
I'm sure they'll go
well with the coffee.

499
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,266
Uh, yeah, let's do it after.

500
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,367
That's fine.

501
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:01,533
So.

502
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:04,066
Why don't you tell
me about yourselves?

503
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,633
Okay, I'll kick things off.

504
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,166
Well, I'm Frank.
- Mmm-hmm.

505
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,200
Head chef.

506
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,533
And the menu is my duty.

507
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:13,300
And my duty only.

508
00:19:14,467 --> 00:19:15,867
Hey, I'm Sal.

509
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,667
I've been here for a couple
years helpin' out, you know.

510
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,500
Hostin', servin',
cookin', all that stuff.

511
00:19:20,633 --> 00:19:21,500
Welcome, Amy.

512
00:19:21,633 --> 00:19:22,500
Thank you.

513
00:19:22,633 --> 00:19:23,700
Uh, yeah. Name's Lorenzo.

514
00:19:23,834 --> 00:19:26,867
I'm an old, old
friend of Frank's.

515
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,233
He actually brought
me in here once things

516
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:29,834
started falling apart and-

517
00:19:29,967 --> 00:19:31,367
Eh.

518
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,533
Just to handle odds and ends.

519
00:19:34,667 --> 00:19:35,533
I'm very handy.

520
00:19:35,667 --> 00:19:36,900
Great.

521
00:19:37,033 --> 00:19:38,367
Listen, everyone.

522
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,200
I know this is a tough
transition for all of us.

523
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:45,734
We all loved Mama, so, so
let's just try to do this

524
00:19:45,867 --> 00:19:47,567
to honor her memory.

525
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,233
On that note, I
took the liberty.

526
00:19:51,367 --> 00:19:52,500
Can you pass these out?

527
00:19:52,633 --> 00:19:55,233
I've assigned various
tasks to each of you

528
00:19:55,367 --> 00:19:58,900
based on your names.

529
00:19:59,033 --> 00:20:00,166
Fun, right?

530
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,700
Yeah, that's
one way to put it.

531
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:04,900
Mama's inheritance will
cover a one-month refresh,

532
00:20:05,033 --> 00:20:06,900
and during that time
we'll experiment

533
00:20:07,033 --> 00:20:08,433
with a soft open,

534
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:12,867
and we will culminate in a
grand reopening celebration.

535
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It's gonna be big.

536
00:20:15,133 --> 00:20:16,834
Go team!

537
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:18,567
- All right.
- Okay.

538
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,166
And don't forget the biscotti.

539
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,867
It's really good.

540
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,066
Nice to meet you.

541
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,066
Biscotti?

542
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,166
I'm good.

543
00:20:32,367 --> 00:20:33,500
Don't worry about them.

544
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:35,233
They'll come around.

545
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,700
Your ragu was Papa's favorite.

546
00:20:55,834 --> 00:20:59,834
He always said the
key to the perfect sauce

547
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:04,533
is to go easy on the seasoning
and heavy on the confidence.

548
00:21:06,367 --> 00:21:09,400
Roberto, come try my ragu.

549
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,800
Perfecto.

550
00:21:16,934 --> 00:21:21,400
And now try

551
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,567
And now try this.

552
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,266
I'm still full from taste
testing your carbonara

553
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,266
an hour ago.

554
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,467
What's the worry?

555
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,800
This is a lot of pressure.

556
00:21:32,934 --> 00:21:34,900
The First Generation
Food Festival is known

557
00:21:35,033 --> 00:21:36,133
to launch careers.

558
00:21:36,266 --> 00:21:38,233
Emilio entered last
year and now look.

559
00:21:38,367 --> 00:21:39,967
Emilio's on Broadway.

560
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,300
You have faith in
your cooking, yeah?

561
00:21:42,433 --> 00:21:43,567
Of course.

562
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,800
Then it will all
work out as it should.

563
00:21:45,934 --> 00:21:47,400
Destino.

564
00:21:47,533 --> 00:21:50,133
Whether it's today
or years from now,

565
00:21:50,266 --> 00:21:52,066
you will open your
dream restaurant.

566
00:21:53,233 --> 00:21:54,633
Now why are you rushing around?

567
00:21:54,767 --> 00:21:56,066
We've got plenty of time.

568
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,066
Come with me.

569
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,200
I have a surprise for you.

570
00:22:05,934 --> 00:22:07,633
This festival is important,

571
00:22:07,767 --> 00:22:10,433
but not more important than
making time for family.

572
00:22:12,433 --> 00:22:14,133
Masseto.

573
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:15,633
But we can't afford-

574
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:18,133
I sold a few lasagnas
in Brooklyn last weekend.

575
00:22:18,266 --> 00:22:20,033
I really like it there.

576
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,433
Tell me, what are you seeing?

577
00:22:26,934 --> 00:22:28,967
The Manhattan skyline.

578
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,533
Mmm.

579
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:33,233
The view from a
quaint, brick building.

580
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:37,867
My restaurant.

581
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,200
Mama's.

582
00:22:43,767 --> 00:22:49,700
One day I will
give you that view.

583
00:22:49,834 --> 00:22:50,867
To Mama's.

584
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,166
To Mama's.

585
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,633
Frank.

586
00:22:55,767 --> 00:22:57,633
Look, look at this.

587
00:22:57,767 --> 00:23:00,367
Papa's sacrifices are
ultimately what led

588
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,867
to the success of my
famous ragu sauce.

589
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,700
Each recipe has a memory,

590
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:08,433
and there's photos and stories.

591
00:23:08,567 --> 00:23:11,066
And nothing super helpful
for our immediate situation?

592
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,266
Well, not necessarily.

593
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,700
What if the key to
refreshing this place

594
00:23:14,834 --> 00:23:17,700
is to go back to the
beginning and replicate

595
00:23:17,834 --> 00:23:19,934
the original look
and feel of Mama's?

596
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:21,033
Okay.

597
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,033
Listen, I know it must feel
like I'm just coming in here

598
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:26,433
to change everything.

599
00:23:26,567 --> 00:23:28,266
Remember, this is for Mama.

600
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,266
Think of it as a reboot.

601
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,433
Everybody loves a reboot.

602
00:23:30,567 --> 00:23:31,700
Do they?

603
00:23:31,834 --> 00:23:32,700
Mmm.

604
00:23:32,834 --> 00:23:34,033
I'm gonna need
you to trust me.

605
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:36,200
Does
that go both ways?

606
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:37,200
Of course.

607
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:38,900
So you trust me with the menu?

608
00:23:39,033 --> 00:23:40,100
Uh.

609
00:23:40,233 --> 00:23:41,367
You have nothing
to worry about.

610
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,567
Why does
that worry me more?

611
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,433
Okay, let me catch
you up with the evolved

612
00:23:44,567 --> 00:23:45,700
flavor of Mama's, huh?

613
00:23:45,834 --> 00:23:47,066
Can I get rid of
the pinball machine?

614
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,533
Absolutely not, no.

615
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,100
I will think about it.

616
00:23:51,233 --> 00:23:55,200
Well, then, I will
give you a chance.

617
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,233
Catch me up on the
evolved flavor of Mama's.

618
00:23:57,367 --> 00:23:58,533
All right, okay.

619
00:24:04,967 --> 00:24:06,333
Hey, sorry I'm late.

620
00:24:06,467 --> 00:24:08,100
We still have time
to catch that movie.

621
00:24:08,233 --> 00:24:09,500
How was day one?

622
00:24:09,633 --> 00:24:12,800
When I quit my job for
more of the challenge,

623
00:24:12,934 --> 00:24:15,266
I think I wanted something
a little less challenging.

624
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,433
Is this about Frank?

625
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,834
Yeah.

626
00:24:19,967 --> 00:24:21,767
But also about Mama.

627
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,000
Mmm.

628
00:24:23,133 --> 00:24:24,500
You know how I said
I never failed her?

629
00:24:24,633 --> 00:24:25,600
Yeah.

630
00:24:25,734 --> 00:24:28,767
Well, we had a big falling out

631
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,100
after I left all
those years ago,

632
00:24:30,233 --> 00:24:32,934
and we hadn't spoken since.

633
00:24:36,066 --> 00:24:38,934
So why would she leave
me her restaurant?

634
00:24:50,266 --> 00:24:51,467
Looking good, Emily.

635
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,700
This place is sparkling clean.

636
00:24:53,834 --> 00:24:55,000
Maybe a bit too sparkling.

637
00:24:55,133 --> 00:24:56,500
Go easy on yourself.

638
00:24:56,633 --> 00:24:57,533
How's it goin' up here, Lorenzo?

639
00:24:57,667 --> 00:24:58,800
Doin' fine.

640
00:24:58,934 --> 00:25:01,567
Amy, these chandeliers
are a little dim.

641
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,233
Are you sure that's what
Mama's used to look like?

642
00:25:03,367 --> 00:25:04,367
Yeah.

643
00:25:05,467 --> 00:25:06,367
No.

644
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,367
Maybe a touch dimmer.

645
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,400
Dimmer?

646
00:25:08,533 --> 00:25:10,400
Oh, perfect.

647
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:11,700
Almost.

648
00:25:11,834 --> 00:25:12,934
Huh.

649
00:25:13,066 --> 00:25:13,967
You want me to add
a touch of white?

650
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,900
Break it up a bit?

651
00:25:16,033 --> 00:25:16,934
Yes!

652
00:25:17,066 --> 00:25:18,100
Okay.

653
00:25:18,233 --> 00:25:19,200
Great idea.

654
00:25:21,567 --> 00:25:23,433
Hate to interrupt Space Blast.

655
00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:25,033
Galaxy Blast.

656
00:25:25,166 --> 00:25:26,600
Oh! Oh! Oh!

657
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:27,867
Why?

658
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,600
I was just about to
beat Sal's high score.

659
00:25:29,734 --> 00:25:32,100
Well, I'm gonna
be frank with you.

660
00:25:32,233 --> 00:25:33,200
I haven't heard
that one before.

661
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:34,300
I need your help.

662
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,066
Help me recreate
Mama's classics.

663
00:25:38,233 --> 00:25:39,266
Come on.

664
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,266
I'm still gonna give
you a chance to show me

665
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,800
your version of the menu.

666
00:25:41,934 --> 00:25:45,033
Why is recreating the original
Mama's so important to you?

667
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:48,734
Why are you so opposed to
bringing back the classics?

668
00:25:48,867 --> 00:25:50,934
Okay, I will think about it.

669
00:25:51,066 --> 00:25:52,533
Okay, great.

670
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:53,900
Thank you.

671
00:25:54,033 --> 00:25:55,033
When are we sampling?

672
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,367
Oh, uh, yeah.

673
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,533
Meet me in the dining room
in two hours for dinner.

674
00:25:59,667 --> 00:26:00,800
Okay.

675
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,100
And bring an appetite.

676
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:11,000
You don't hurry up, dinner's
gonna become breakfast.

677
00:26:11,133 --> 00:26:13,233
Okay, you really
shouldn't rush the chef.

678
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:19,533
Here is your complete
sampling of Mama's new menu.

679
00:26:23,233 --> 00:26:24,667
Where do you wanna start?

680
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,867
What's that one?

681
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,800
Ah, these are roast
branzino with tomatoes,

682
00:26:27,934 --> 00:26:29,700
potatoes, and olives.

683
00:26:31,066 --> 00:26:32,066
You know what it's not?

684
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,066
What?

685
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,200
Mama's penne.

686
00:26:35,233 --> 00:26:36,133
I know.

687
00:26:36,266 --> 00:26:37,166
That's Mama's right here.

688
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,633
Oh.

689
00:26:38,767 --> 00:26:40,300
Great!

690
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:42,600
Here we go.

691
00:26:46,133 --> 00:26:48,600
It's hot.

692
00:26:48,734 --> 00:26:50,600
Not very adventurous, are ya?

693
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:51,834
Adventurous?

694
00:26:51,967 --> 00:26:53,166
Not when it comes
to habanero penne.

695
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,600
It's habiata.

696
00:26:54,734 --> 00:26:56,633
Look, the menu's sort
of become a fusion.

697
00:26:56,767 --> 00:26:58,934
It's Mama's classics
with a little more edge.

698
00:26:59,066 --> 00:27:01,066
Old and the new,
come together as one.

699
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,934
And how did you
end up at Mama's?

700
00:27:04,867 --> 00:27:06,667
Ah, eh, Lorenzo!

701
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,900
Tiramisu?

702
00:27:08,033 --> 00:27:09,166
Comin'
right up, Frankie!

703
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,200
You're deflecting.

704
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:11,400
I'm not deflecting.

705
00:27:11,533 --> 00:27:12,400
You are. There's
a story there.

706
00:27:12,533 --> 00:27:13,400
I'd like to hear it.
- No story.

707
00:27:13,533 --> 00:27:14,400
I applied, she hired me.

708
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:15,500
That's the end of it.

709
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:16,834
Ah. Here, perfect.

710
00:27:18,133 --> 00:27:19,000
Try some, go ahead.

711
00:27:19,133 --> 00:27:20,000
Thanks.

712
00:27:20,133 --> 00:27:21,166
You got it, boss.

713
00:27:23,467 --> 00:27:28,734
You know, I'm more
of a cannoli girl.

714
00:27:28,867 --> 00:27:30,867
Are you a picky eater?

715
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,333
No.

716
00:27:32,467 --> 00:27:34,333
Oh my gosh, no wonder
you're so opposed to my menu.

717
00:27:34,467 --> 00:27:36,233
Your tastes are less
branzino habiata,

718
00:27:36,367 --> 00:27:38,700
more chicken nuggets,
mac and cheese.

719
00:27:38,834 --> 00:27:40,333
Who doesn't love chicken
nuggets and mac and cheese?

720
00:27:40,467 --> 00:27:42,000
Oh, we could sample
the kid's menu instead.

721
00:27:42,133 --> 00:27:43,533
Okay, now you're
being obnoxious.

722
00:27:43,667 --> 00:27:46,667
I will try your famous
tiramisu one day.

723
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,834
Well, I'm gonna
hold you to that.

724
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:48,967
Great.

725
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,867
Now that I've sampled
some of Frank's fusion,

726
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,767
how about you try
something for me?

727
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,400
Can I get Mama's Flight?

728
00:28:02,533 --> 00:28:03,734
- You got it.
- Thank you.

729
00:28:03,867 --> 00:28:05,066
Mama's Flight?

730
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,066
Yeah.

731
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,300
All Mama's favorite wines.

732
00:28:07,433 --> 00:28:09,066
I'm surprised you didn't
know about this place.

733
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,300
Nice place.

734
00:28:11,433 --> 00:28:13,734
Thanks.

735
00:28:13,867 --> 00:28:15,633
Chianti.

736
00:28:15,767 --> 00:28:20,433
Light, fruity.

737
00:28:20,567 --> 00:28:22,133
It's comforting.

738
00:28:22,266 --> 00:28:23,633
Well, this was
our drink of choice

739
00:28:23,767 --> 00:28:26,734
whenever we'd have long
talks about life and love.

740
00:28:26,867 --> 00:28:29,066
And this

741
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:35,233
is a Meroni.

742
00:28:36,934 --> 00:28:38,300
Mmm.

743
00:28:38,433 --> 00:28:39,600
Bold.

744
00:28:39,734 --> 00:28:40,934
Yeah, well that's why
Mama associated that one

745
00:28:41,066 --> 00:28:43,900
with the rush of
taking risks in life.

746
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,400
Is that one familiar at all?

747
00:28:52,867 --> 00:28:54,300
It's Masseto.

748
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:55,433
Mama and Papa's favorite.

749
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,300
Exactly.

750
00:28:57,433 --> 00:29:00,166
I checked the stock room.

751
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,000
Why aren't we carrying any
of Mama's favorite wines?

752
00:29:02,133 --> 00:29:03,533
Oh, we had to scale back.

753
00:29:03,667 --> 00:29:05,533
I mean, as our customer base
slowed, so did our demand.

754
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:07,300
Sure, but as you
lose the staples,

755
00:29:07,433 --> 00:29:08,867
you lose Mama's memory.

756
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,800
I mean, you don't want people
to forget about her, do you?

757
00:29:11,934 --> 00:29:13,533
No.

758
00:29:13,667 --> 00:29:15,066
No, no, of course not.

759
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,200
Hey, well, that's why we
need to go back to the basics.

760
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:19,934
We need more Mama, not less.

761
00:29:22,834 --> 00:29:26,033
So does this, uh, this
new reboot idea of yours

762
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:28,033
mean you're stickin' around?

763
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:29,633
I, uh.

764
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:31,000
Maybe.

765
00:29:31,133 --> 00:29:34,300
Could be a way for me to
make things right again.

766
00:29:34,433 --> 00:29:35,400
Make things right?

767
00:29:36,266 --> 00:29:37,800
Yeah.

768
00:29:37,934 --> 00:29:39,467
Aesthetically, you know?

769
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,633
Yeah.

770
00:29:40,767 --> 00:29:41,867
You ready for one more stop?

771
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,967
Do I have a choice?

772
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,200
Drink up.

773
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:45,567
The Masseto's expensive.

774
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,633
You're awfully quiet
all the way here.

775
00:29:50,767 --> 00:29:52,300
Didn't wanna make
any sudden moves.

776
00:29:52,433 --> 00:29:54,633
Your tastes may be
safe, but your driving?

777
00:29:54,767 --> 00:29:56,367
Ha! Another story.

778
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,633
I was so far from that
man when I parallel parked.

779
00:30:00,767 --> 00:30:02,867
Yeah, keep telling
yourself that.

780
00:30:04,266 --> 00:30:05,533
There it is.

781
00:30:05,667 --> 00:30:07,867
Mama and Papa's first
apartment here in the States.

782
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,633
That's where she dreamed
of making her mark

783
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:13,000
on the culinary world and
then accomplished so much.

784
00:30:13,133 --> 00:30:14,734
There's so much history there.

785
00:30:16,133 --> 00:30:20,467
Seasons change,
history remains, huh?

786
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:25,367
Poetic.

787
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:30,633
I wanted to show
you something, look.

788
00:30:30,767 --> 00:30:32,367
1972.

789
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,700
Ah.

790
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:37,367
Mama's opened exactly
50 years ago this year.

791
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,667
What better way to honor
her memory than to reopen

792
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,700
on the 50th anniversary?

793
00:30:41,834 --> 00:30:42,700
The 15th?

794
00:30:42,834 --> 00:30:43,800
Yeah.

795
00:30:43,934 --> 00:30:45,100
That's two weeks away.

796
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:48,166
What happened to our
one month timeline?

797
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,667
We'll, we'll just
expedite the schedule

798
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,633
so the reopening coincides
with the anniversary.

799
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:54,700
It will be a lot of
work, but we can do it.

800
00:30:54,834 --> 00:30:56,133
Mama will be our guide.

801
00:30:56,266 --> 00:30:58,000
Seems overly ambitious,
don't ya think?

802
00:30:59,934 --> 00:31:01,200
Oh, gotta take this.

803
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:02,367
Excuse me.

804
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,367
This is Frank.

805
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,033
Hey, Frank, how you doin'?

806
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:07,867
It's Wallace here over
at Reggio's on 52nd.

807
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,433
You may have heard that
we're getting ready

808
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:11,367
to open in a couple of weeks.

809
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,467
Listen, I heard that you are
on the hunt for a new gig.

810
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:18,266
I have an opening for you.

811
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,900
Yeah, talk to me.

812
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:30,100
Ah, we're reopening
in two weeks.

813
00:31:30,233 --> 00:31:31,400
Two weeks?

814
00:31:31,533 --> 00:31:33,033
That's fast.

815
00:31:33,166 --> 00:31:34,033
You worried?

816
00:31:34,166 --> 00:31:35,300
Was. Not anymore.

817
00:31:37,066 --> 00:31:38,266
Got an interview.

818
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,400
Interview what?

819
00:31:39,533 --> 00:31:40,433
At Reggio's.

820
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:41,934
Looking for a new head chef.

821
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,700
If all goes according
to plan, uh,

822
00:31:44,667 --> 00:31:45,734
think I'm leavin' Mama's.

823
00:31:45,867 --> 00:31:47,033
What do you mean
you're leaving Mama's?

824
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:48,266
Shh, shh, shh.

825
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,433
Look, you know I wanna
do my own thing, right?

826
00:31:49,567 --> 00:31:50,500
Doesn't look like I can
do that here anymore.

827
00:31:50,633 --> 00:31:51,734
- You can't.
- Just-

828
00:31:51,867 --> 00:31:53,200
Gather around, everyone!

829
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:54,700
Talk later.

830
00:31:57,834 --> 00:31:59,867
All right.

831
00:32:00,066 --> 00:32:03,433
Our timeline just got
a little bit tighter.

832
00:32:03,567 --> 00:32:05,600
The 50th anniversary of
Mama's is in two weeks,

833
00:32:05,734 --> 00:32:08,133
and we're aiming
to be open by then.

834
00:32:08,266 --> 00:32:10,934
I even took out an ad in
The Times to celebrate.

835
00:32:11,066 --> 00:32:14,266
And, to lighten your load,
I'm gonna bring in more crew.

836
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,500
Sound good?

837
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:19,266
Uh, good is not the
word for it.

838
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,800
Oops, didn't think
you could hear me.

839
00:32:20,934 --> 00:32:24,300
Was hoping you'd be more
of a team player, Frank?

840
00:32:24,433 --> 00:32:25,767
Loyal associate.

841
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,100
Amy, we're a family
here at Mama's, okay?

842
00:32:28,233 --> 00:32:29,867
Not corporate employees.

843
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:32,767
Hmm.

844
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,867
No, you're right.

845
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,800
Well.

846
00:32:36,934 --> 00:32:37,834
On what?

847
00:32:37,967 --> 00:32:39,166
You're right.

848
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,500
We're a family.

849
00:32:40,633 --> 00:32:41,800
Absolutely.

850
00:32:41,934 --> 00:32:43,000
Yeah.

851
00:32:43,133 --> 00:32:45,000
I'd also like
us to be friends.

852
00:32:45,133 --> 00:32:46,667
Well, you wanna be my friend?

853
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,600
I propose a compromise.

854
00:32:48,734 --> 00:32:50,800
We'll carry the
old with the new.

855
00:32:50,934 --> 00:32:53,100
Some of Mama's recipes
and some of yours.

856
00:32:53,233 --> 00:32:54,600
Mama did love a compromise.

857
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,834
Okay, yeah, we can be friends.

858
00:32:59,967 --> 00:33:02,233
All right, so then
how about you brush up

859
00:33:02,367 --> 00:33:04,934
on Mama's recipes and
I'll go handle the hiring?

860
00:33:07,533 --> 00:33:10,066
Menu is your territory, right?

861
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,367
Yeah, right.

862
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,367
Right.

863
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,567
Okay, all right.

864
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,000
Let's all go home
and get some sleep.

865
00:33:15,133 --> 00:33:17,667
We'll come back tomorrow
rested and ready to go.

866
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,333
We can do this!

867
00:33:19,467 --> 00:33:25,734
Yeah!

868
00:33:25,867 --> 00:33:27,600
all around the restaurant.

869
00:33:27,734 --> 00:33:29,600
These are rich with
history, so let's put them

870
00:33:29,734 --> 00:33:30,934
back up where they belong.

871
00:33:31,066 --> 00:33:34,767
There's some of Mama,
Italy, Papa, of course.

872
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,433
Recapture the spirit of Mama's.

873
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:45,033
Here at Mama's we are
lookin' for somebody

874
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:47,900
who is enthusiastic
and hardworking.

875
00:33:48,033 --> 00:33:48,900
Responsible.

876
00:33:49,033 --> 00:33:49,900
Punctual.

877
00:33:50,033 --> 00:33:51,266
Tenacious.

878
00:33:56,233 --> 00:33:58,934
Someone who is excited
to come to work everyday.

879
00:33:59,066 --> 00:34:01,600
Someone who wants to
be part of our family,

880
00:34:01,734 --> 00:34:03,333
because here at Mama's
it's not just the food,

881
00:34:03,467 --> 00:34:05,834
it's the people who make
this place so special.

882
00:34:05,967 --> 00:34:07,800
Now I know you already
have another job,

883
00:34:07,934 --> 00:34:10,100
but the qualifications
are impeccable,

884
00:34:10,233 --> 00:34:11,934
your years of
experience impressive,

885
00:34:12,066 --> 00:34:14,000
and your baked goods
are out of this world,

886
00:34:14,133 --> 00:34:15,734
so if you're looking
for some extra hours,

887
00:34:15,867 --> 00:34:16,767
I'd love to bring you on.

888
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,100
What do you say?

889
00:34:18,233 --> 00:34:19,433
I say sign me up.

890
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,266
I'm so glad we're gonna
be working together again.

891
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,133
Oh, I'm so happy you
offer such a generous

892
00:34:24,266 --> 00:34:25,367
employee discount!

893
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,266
Okay!

894
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,166
Okay, no, I'm happy to
work together with you.

895
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,200
Okay.

896
00:34:31,767 --> 00:34:34,934
Didn't realize there was
a tornado in the forecast.

897
00:34:37,066 --> 00:34:38,600
I'm a little rusty
on Mama's old recipes.

898
00:34:38,734 --> 00:34:40,100
Feeling any less rusty?

899
00:34:40,233 --> 00:34:41,100
Eh.

900
00:34:41,233 --> 00:34:42,667
When's the last time you ate?

901
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,233
Why do you ask?

902
00:34:46,467 --> 00:34:47,834
Come in!

903
00:34:47,967 --> 00:34:49,800
Hope this pairs well
with whatever takeout

904
00:34:49,934 --> 00:34:51,266
you're ordering for us tonight.

905
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,467
What are you doing?

906
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,767
I'm not ordering takeout.

907
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,800
I'm gonna make you a
spaghetti di Maria.

908
00:34:55,934 --> 00:34:57,166
Oh, really?

909
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,433
Okay.

910
00:34:58,567 --> 00:35:00,667
Having said that, I'm
not really a good chef,

911
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,333
hence my landing on the
management side.

912
00:35:03,467 --> 00:35:04,734
You're like Papa.

913
00:35:04,867 --> 00:35:06,433
I guess that
makes you like Mama.

914
00:35:11,033 --> 00:35:13,900
So I may need some of your
chef skills to

915
00:35:14,033 --> 00:35:16,000
fill in any knowledge
gaps I might have.

916
00:35:16,133 --> 00:35:17,667
I doubt you'll need
any help from me.

917
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,667
Well, you know.

918
00:35:20,667 --> 00:35:22,734
On second thought,

919
00:35:22,867 --> 00:35:24,333
what could it hurt?

920
00:35:24,467 --> 00:35:25,734
Hmm.

921
00:35:25,867 --> 00:35:28,400
Use Parmesan instead of...

922
00:35:28,533 --> 00:35:29,400
You're doing great.

923
00:35:29,533 --> 00:35:30,900
- Am I?
- Doing great.

924
00:35:31,033 --> 00:35:32,066
This is hard work.

925
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,333
Not, not too much.

926
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:34,667
It's fun, though, right?

927
00:35:37,967 --> 00:35:39,734
There you go.

928
00:35:41,867 --> 00:35:42,834
See? Simple.

929
00:35:46,533 --> 00:35:47,567
Mmm.

930
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,000
I forgot how delicious that was.

931
00:35:50,133 --> 00:35:51,667
Isn't kind of hard
not to think about her

932
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,467
when making her specialties?

933
00:35:56,367 --> 00:36:01,233
It's been the toughest
part for me, yeah.

934
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:03,133
When was the last
time you two spoke?

935
00:36:03,266 --> 00:36:05,233
Oh, we checked in here and
there over the past few months,

936
00:36:05,367 --> 00:36:08,900
but the last thing I said
to her in person was,

937
00:36:10,934 --> 00:36:12,467
"Don't eat too much gnocci."

938
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,834
What about you?

939
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,600
It's, uh.

940
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,633
Hey, Emily. What's up?

941
00:36:24,767 --> 00:36:25,633
Oh, hey.

942
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:27,467
Um, not much.

943
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,800
Just a little problem.

944
00:36:29,934 --> 00:36:31,800
Big problem!

945
00:36:31,934 --> 00:36:35,066
Sorry, did Lorenzo
just say big problem?

946
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,133
What's goin' on?

947
00:36:36,266 --> 00:36:37,133
I don't know.

948
00:36:37,266 --> 00:36:38,433
Ah, nothing, Frank.

949
00:36:38,567 --> 00:36:39,633
It's this stove, we're
trying to fire it up.

950
00:36:39,767 --> 00:36:41,300
Frank, the thing is kaput.

951
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:42,567
It's not, eh.

952
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,767
You could be a little
more tactful, you know?

953
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:44,967
What, there's no
use dancin' around it.

954
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,400
Well, you could dance
a little around it.

955
00:36:46,533 --> 00:36:47,400
It's fine, Frank.

956
00:36:47,533 --> 00:36:48,834
We're almost there.

957
00:36:48,967 --> 00:36:50,400
That stove has been in
desperate need of a tuneup.

958
00:36:50,533 --> 00:36:51,467
We just hadn't
gotten around to it.

959
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,467
It's this thing right
here, I'm telling you, yeah.

960
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,400
The soft open is in two days.

961
00:36:56,533 --> 00:36:57,834
Can we fix it before then?

962
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,800
Uh...

963
00:37:01,934 --> 00:37:03,033
All right.

964
00:37:03,166 --> 00:37:04,200
Lift this up.
- Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

965
00:37:04,333 --> 00:37:05,200
Just gonna lean
over a little bit.

966
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:06,533
Okay, go ahead.

967
00:37:06,667 --> 00:37:07,867
- Oh, I got it.
- Nice.

968
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,300
I think I got it.

969
00:37:09,433 --> 00:37:10,867
I don't got it.

970
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,633
Hmm.

971
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:17,967
Hmm.

972
00:37:21,633 --> 00:37:24,500
I paired my
gnocci with my ragu sauce

973
00:37:24,633 --> 00:37:26,500
for the food festival.

974
00:37:26,633 --> 00:37:29,500
It fit together
like me and Papa.

975
00:37:29,633 --> 00:37:31,433
The perfect match.

976
00:37:33,633 --> 00:37:37,834
Hey, Frank,
you gotta try the pizza!

977
00:37:37,967 --> 00:37:38,967
Gnocci ragu.

978
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,133
Extra for you.

979
00:37:40,266 --> 00:37:41,233
Thank you.

980
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,700
Mmm.

981
00:37:46,834 --> 00:37:48,266
You two make quite the team.

982
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,400
Jacob.

983
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,133
I'm an accountant
and also an investor.

984
00:37:54,266 --> 00:37:55,633
Come by for a
business consultation.

985
00:37:55,767 --> 00:37:59,166
I think I may be able to
help you expand Mama's.

986
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,967
Here's my fee, I marked it down.

987
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:06,233
That's very kind of you,
but I'm afraid we still

988
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:07,533
can't afford this.

989
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,767
I'm also looking for a
little help around the office.

990
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,934
Errands, paperwork.

991
00:38:16,066 --> 00:38:17,934
Gopher-type tasks.

992
00:38:18,066 --> 00:38:19,533
Maybe we could work out a deal.

993
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:23,100
I'll do it.

994
00:38:23,233 --> 00:38:24,934
Roberto, but you
already have a job.

995
00:38:25,066 --> 00:38:26,233
I can work nights.

996
00:38:26,367 --> 00:38:28,467
And maybe I'll pick up
some budgeting tips.

997
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,767
I believe in you.

998
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,400
When can I start?

999
00:38:34,533 --> 00:38:36,767
I think you just did.

1000
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,433
Ah, what Papa
proved is hard work

1001
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,767
and opportunity
can come together

1002
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:46,700
and create a beautiful recipe
that we called good fortune.

1003
00:38:46,834 --> 00:38:48,700
Well, I did what I could.

1004
00:38:50,233 --> 00:38:51,700
Needs a new spark module.

1005
00:38:51,834 --> 00:38:54,600
Without that, the oven is
just a giant paperweight.

1006
00:38:54,734 --> 00:38:56,700
So we'll order a new part.

1007
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:57,700
It's just a small hiccup.

1008
00:38:57,834 --> 00:38:59,233
Well, good luck finding one.

1009
00:38:59,367 --> 00:39:00,767
This thing's from the '60s.

1010
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,800
I don't even know if they
make replacement parts

1011
00:39:02,934 --> 00:39:04,033
for it anymore.

1012
00:39:04,166 --> 00:39:06,166
Okay, so it's a bad
case of the hiccups,

1013
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,033
but we'll just dig
in and work harder.

1014
00:39:10,233 --> 00:39:12,633
We could just get
a brand-new stove.

1015
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,166
It's just a part, Frank.

1016
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,767
There's no need to replace
Mama's original stove

1017
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,500
for one part.

1018
00:39:18,633 --> 00:39:20,600
If we find it, can you fix it?

1019
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:22,100
Yes, ma'am.

1020
00:39:23,767 --> 00:39:24,834
Yeah, all right.

1021
00:39:24,967 --> 00:39:26,934
I'll, I'll, I'll
help you find it.

1022
00:39:27,066 --> 00:39:27,934
Great.

1023
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:29,333
Thank you.

1024
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:31,400
We'll scour the city
first thing tomorrow.

1025
00:39:35,467 --> 00:39:37,000
Didn't put up much of a fight.

1026
00:39:37,133 --> 00:39:38,266
Huh?

1027
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,100
Who is this softy
and what has he done

1028
00:39:40,233 --> 00:39:42,333
with the bold as brass
Frank Rossi, huh?

1029
00:39:42,467 --> 00:39:43,767
I was being a team player.

1030
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,800
Oh, is that what it was?

1031
00:39:44,934 --> 00:39:46,033
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

1032
00:39:46,166 --> 00:39:49,000
Plus, you know, this
soft open is a great way

1033
00:39:49,133 --> 00:39:51,166
to get my menu out before
I take it elsewhere.

1034
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,433
Mmm, mmm, yeah, no.

1035
00:39:53,567 --> 00:39:54,767
No, that's not what it is.

1036
00:39:58,433 --> 00:39:59,867
Could it be?

1037
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:03,000
Nah.

1038
00:40:03,133 --> 00:40:04,266
Nah is right.

1039
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,433
Mmm-hmm.

1040
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,000
No.

1041
00:40:09,133 --> 00:40:10,500
Okay.
- Uh-huh.

1042
00:40:10,633 --> 00:40:11,500
Frank.
- Yeah?

1043
00:40:11,633 --> 00:40:12,533
Kitchen's that way.

1044
00:40:12,667 --> 00:40:13,533
- I know.
- Uh-huh.

1045
00:40:13,667 --> 00:40:14,934
Kitchen's in there.

1046
00:40:32,567 --> 00:40:36,133
My famous wedding
soup is best served

1047
00:40:36,266 --> 00:40:38,667
with a little spontaneity.

1048
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,433
Surprise, amore mio.

1049
00:40:40,567 --> 00:40:43,500
Surprise doesn't even
begin to describe it.

1050
00:40:43,633 --> 00:40:45,967
How did you do all of
this without my knowing?

1051
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,166
The rooftop was
completely empty before.

1052
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,767
I snuck away during
your busiest hours.

1053
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,767
Slowly brought things
up one at a time.

1054
00:40:53,967 --> 00:40:56,133
I tried to make an
amazing wedding soup.

1055
00:40:56,266 --> 00:40:57,700
Seemed appropriate for today.

1056
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,934
I just hope it's edible.

1057
00:41:00,133 --> 00:41:01,600

1066

You have sacrificed
so much for me.

00:41:32,533 --> 00:41:35,333
I'd do it over

Come up here to read sometimes.

1082

It's peaceful.

1083

Oh, new project of mine.

Yeah, it's just been awhile
since I've been up here.

1090
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,700
My memories of Mama
hit especially hard
sometimes, I think.

1091
00:43:00,834 --> 00:43:01,800
Yeah.

1092
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:08,033
Well, today was Mama and
Papa's wedding anniversary.

1093
00:43:08,166 --> 00:43:11,133
Do you know they celebrated
up here every year?

1094
00:43:11,266 --> 00:43:12,300
Had an inkling.

1095
00:43:15,667 --> 00:43:17,166
Let's go get
that spark module.

1096
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:18,266
Yes.

1097
00:43:20,834 --> 00:43:23,166
After a quick detour first.

1098
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,867
Come on.

1099
00:43:30,967 --> 00:43:32,200
Little Italy?

1100
00:43:32,333 --> 00:43:34,166
Mama's home away from home.

1101
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,066
I figure we could
celebrate Mama's and Papa's

1102
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,667
wedding anniversary
in her absence

1103
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,734
by visiting a few of
their favorite spots.

1104
00:43:41,867 --> 00:43:43,433
And according to this,

1105
00:43:44,633 --> 00:43:48,166
favorite gelato place should be

1106
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,567
right there.

1107
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,667
So is this little
excursion really just

1108
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,066
to celebrate Mama and Papa?

1109
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,967
It may also be a chance
for me to get to know

1110
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,033
my new friend.

1111
00:43:57,166 --> 00:43:59,000
What do you wanna know?

1112
00:43:59,133 --> 00:44:01,133
Well, you wanted to
keep Mama's memory alive,

1113
00:44:01,266 --> 00:44:02,934
let's keep it alive.

1114
00:44:03,066 --> 00:44:04,934
Tell me about what it was
like growing up with her.

1115
00:44:05,066 --> 00:44:07,300
Well, she kind of
helped my dad raise me

1116
00:44:07,433 --> 00:44:08,734
after we lost my mom.

1117
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,133
She became my surrogate mama.

1118
00:44:13,266 --> 00:44:16,300
And she was just
always there for me,

1119
00:44:16,433 --> 00:44:18,100
especially after my dad
retired and moved to Florida,

1120
00:44:18,233 --> 00:44:19,467
left me the apartment.

1121
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,734
How traditionally
New York, eh?

1122
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:25,400
And she and Papa
both taught me better

1123
00:44:25,533 --> 00:44:26,967
than to settle for second-best.

1124
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:28,467
Gosh, told me
everything about Papa.

1125
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,734
Yeah.

1126
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:31,567
You're really lucky
to have known him.

1127
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,233
Yeah.

1128
00:44:33,367 --> 00:44:36,467
You know, you, uh,
you never told me about

1129
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,233
the last time you
and Mama spoke.

1130
00:44:40,266 --> 00:44:42,567
You know, we should really
go find that spark thing.

1131
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:43,567
Aw, come on.

1132
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,133
Now you're deflecting.

1133
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:46,400
Come on.

1134
00:44:46,533 --> 00:44:47,900
There's not much to tell.

1135
00:44:48,033 --> 00:44:52,066
I mean, it was about a year
after I left Mama's and...

1136
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,266
Amy?

1137
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,266
Surprise!

1138
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,133
I haven't seen you in months!

1139
00:44:57,266 --> 00:44:58,633
I know.

1140
00:44:58,767 --> 00:45:00,133
I've been so busy
at the new job.

1141
00:45:00,266 --> 00:45:01,734
It's unforgivable, I'm sorry.

1142
00:45:05,767 --> 00:45:08,000
Well, Chow's more
about professionalism

1143
00:45:08,133 --> 00:45:09,467
than getting your hands dirty.

1144
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,200
Oh, sounds like a lot of fun.

1145
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:13,033
I know.

1146
00:45:13,166 --> 00:45:14,533
So, listen.

1147
00:45:14,667 --> 00:45:16,200
I heard you guys were
going through a bit

1148
00:45:16,333 --> 00:45:17,533
of a slump lately.

1149
00:45:17,667 --> 00:45:18,800
No.

1150
00:45:18,934 --> 00:45:20,000
The crew let me
in over the weekend,

1151
00:45:20,133 --> 00:45:21,133
and I put together a
little surprise for you.

1152
00:45:21,266 --> 00:45:22,133
What?

1153
00:45:22,266 --> 00:45:23,233
Yeah, come see.

1154
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,700
What are we doing?

1155
00:45:25,834 --> 00:45:30,467
I present to you,
Mama's on the Rooftop.

1156
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,367
It could be a whole
new experience,

1157
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:33,500
attract a younger crowd,

1158
00:45:33,633 --> 00:45:35,300
make Mama's an even
hotter hot spot.

1159
00:45:35,433 --> 00:45:36,400
What do you think?

1160
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:41,467
I think this is not Mama's.

1161
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,033
What do you mean?

1162
00:45:44,166 --> 00:45:47,700
The rooftop was never
meant for business.

1163
00:45:47,834 --> 00:45:53,033
It was always just
a special place for

1164
00:45:53,166 --> 00:45:54,467
me and Papa.

1165
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,367
Yeah, I thought, I thought
you'd wanna share that

1166
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:57,367
with the world.

1167
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,734
I don't wanna share it.

1168
00:46:00,066 --> 00:46:05,100
It's a sacred place for, for us.

1169
00:46:05,233 --> 00:46:08,200
I just,

1170
00:46:08,333 --> 00:46:10,233
I just wanted to
help boost business

1171
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:11,700
and modernize a bit.

1172
00:46:11,834 --> 00:46:15,600
You know, I would just
hate to see Mama's close.

1173
00:46:15,734 --> 00:46:17,333
We're not closing.

1174
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:20,367
We're doing just fine.

1175
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,200
We don't need any change.

1176
00:46:22,333 --> 00:46:25,867
Please, take this
down before you go.

1177
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,400
And then life just got busy,

1178
00:46:36,533 --> 00:46:38,600
and we exchanged messages,

1179
00:46:38,734 --> 00:46:40,834
but we never got the
chance to reconcile.

1180
00:46:40,967 --> 00:46:41,967
Or say goodbye.

1181
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,700
But I'll always be
her little tesoro.

1182
00:46:44,834 --> 00:46:45,700
Wait a minute.

1183
00:46:45,834 --> 00:46:46,700
What'd you say?

1184
00:46:46,834 --> 00:46:48,400
- Tesoro?
- Mmm-hmm.

1185
00:46:48,533 --> 00:46:50,367
She talked about you.

1186
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:51,367
What?

1187
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,867
Yes, all the time.

1188
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,867
She talked about her
tesoro, her treasure,

1189
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,867
how she missed you
dearly, how she loved you.

1190
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,533
I just realized she
was talkin' about you.

1191
00:46:59,667 --> 00:47:01,166
You don't have to try
to make me feel better.

1192
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:02,300
No, trust me.

1193
00:47:02,433 --> 00:47:03,333
I'm not known for
going out of my way

1194
00:47:03,467 --> 00:47:04,567
to be sweet and comforting.

1195
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,333
I'm telling the truth, Amy.

1196
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,800
So, you ready for
detour number two?

1197
00:47:14,934 --> 00:47:16,433
How many?

1198
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:18,600
Well, it's up to Mama
and Papa, isn't it?

1199
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:24,433
All right.

1200
00:47:29,567 --> 00:47:32,000
This is supposed to be
where their favorite

1201
00:47:32,133 --> 00:47:36,433
hotdog spot was, but
times change, I guess.

1202
00:47:36,567 --> 00:47:38,033
But history remains, right?

1203
00:47:39,467 --> 00:47:41,600
Right.

1204
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:43,333
Let me ask you the same
question you asked me.

1205
00:47:43,467 --> 00:47:45,867
What kind of impact
did Mama have on you?

1206
00:47:47,133 --> 00:47:49,667
Saved me from myself in a way.

1207
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,066
Used to be a little hard headed.

1208
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,200
No!

1209
00:47:54,066 --> 00:47:56,600
There are remnants of
the old Frank there, maybe.

1210
00:47:56,734 --> 00:47:57,834
I'm human, after all.

1211
00:47:57,967 --> 00:48:00,533
It's just a defense
mechanism, you know.

1212
00:48:00,667 --> 00:48:02,700
Is that right, Dr. Drew?

1213
00:48:04,533 --> 00:48:06,834
I've seen glimpses
of the real Frank,

1214
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,367
the one who saw I was
having a tough time

1215
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,066
on the roof and orchestrated
an anniversary getaway

1216
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,066
to cheer me up.

1217
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:14,066
Yeah, don't mention it.

1218
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,333
I mean that.

1219
00:48:15,467 --> 00:48:16,800
It's getting a little
too sentimental in here.

1220
00:48:17,867 --> 00:48:19,500
Oh-ho!

1221
00:48:19,633 --> 00:48:20,734
Look at this!

1222
00:48:20,867 --> 00:48:23,567
Mama loved
knickknacks like this.

1223
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:24,800
It's us!

1224
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:27,333
It's cute.

1225
00:48:27,467 --> 00:48:28,433
I'll take it.

1226
00:48:29,967 --> 00:48:31,233
What are you
gonna do with that?

1227
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:32,233
What am I gonna do?

1228
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:33,400
We'll find a spot for it.

1229
00:48:33,533 --> 00:48:35,066
And I love what it represents.

1230
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,166
Friendship is all
about understanding
and trust, honesty.

1231
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:40,600
All the things we have now.

1232
00:48:42,133 --> 00:48:43,500
Right.

1233
00:48:43,633 --> 00:48:45,066
So where to next?

1234
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,367
Last stop.

1235
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:47,834
This one's a special one.

1236
00:48:49,033 --> 00:48:51,333
Thank you.

1237
00:48:51,467 --> 00:48:54,900
Mama's recipe
for a successful marriage.

1238
00:49:00,367 --> 00:49:01,800
I didn't think we'd
get a moment of peace

1239
00:49:01,934 --> 00:49:05,133
and quiet today.

1240
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:09,800
Hmm.

1241
00:49:09,934 --> 00:49:12,200
You're nervous about the future.

1242
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:18,066
It's a good nervous.

1243
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:21,967
Here.

1244
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,567
This is a worry.

1245
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:25,567
No.

1246
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:27,600
This is a rock.

1247
00:49:27,734 --> 00:49:30,800
Yes, but imagine it's a worry,

1248
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:32,900
a fear, a problem.

1249
00:49:34,367 --> 00:49:37,934
Hold onto it for a second,
but only for a second.

1250
00:49:38,066 --> 00:49:40,967
And then...

1251
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:42,233
Oh!

1252
00:49:43,367 --> 00:49:46,100
Let go!

1253
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:48,133
My father put a lot
of pressure on me

1254
00:49:48,266 --> 00:49:50,633
to make something of
myself like my brothers did

1255
00:49:50,767 --> 00:49:52,133
back in Tuscany.

1256
00:49:52,266 --> 00:49:53,633
They all had made their
mark in the wine industry,

1257
00:49:53,767 --> 00:49:55,767
but I had other plans.

1258
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:59,166
It was my mother who encouraged
me to follow my heart.

1259
00:50:01,567 --> 00:50:04,767
And look what happened.

1260
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:05,934
It led me to you.

1261
00:50:12,567 --> 00:50:15,967
Hmm?

1262
00:50:18,433 --> 00:50:19,800
Don't you feel lighter?

1263
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:21,233
Much lighter.

1264
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,900
We should get back
before the reception.

1265
00:50:26,033 --> 00:50:27,567
Okay, but first,

1266
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,300
one for each of my new in-laws.

1267
00:50:31,433 --> 00:50:32,800
Hey!

1268
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,633
Recipe for a
successful marriage.

1269
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:40,400
One part trust, one
part communication,

1270
00:50:40,533 --> 00:50:43,133
and many parts wine and pasta.

1271
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,166
That tracks.

1272
00:50:47,533 --> 00:50:48,900
You know, Mama had
a new lesson for me

1273
00:50:49,033 --> 00:50:50,233
every time I came to work.

1274
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:52,767
Guess I could look at
these as all the ones

1275
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:53,900
we never got to.

1276
00:50:56,367 --> 00:50:59,567
You know, deep down
she forgives you,

1277
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:02,133
no matter what happened.

1278
00:51:02,266 --> 00:51:05,200
You can let go.

1279
00:51:05,333 --> 00:51:11,967
Hmm.

1280
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:17,133
Come here.

1281
00:51:17,266 --> 00:51:18,867
Come here.

1282
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,533
All right, give me that.

1283
00:51:46,533 --> 00:51:48,200
hat?

1284
00:51:48,333 --> 00:51:49,667
I cannot believe
you found a place

1285
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,667
that sells vintage
appliance parts.

1286
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:52,900
I knew a guy.

1287
00:51:53,033 --> 00:51:54,033
I mean, key to finding
anything in this city,

1288
00:51:54,166 --> 00:51:55,033
you gotta know a guy.

1289
00:51:55,166 --> 00:51:56,333
I was very impressed.

1290
00:51:56,467 --> 00:51:57,500
You're so much more
than just the weirdo

1291
00:51:57,633 --> 00:51:58,667
I met that the coffee shop.

1292
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,400
You love calling me weird.

1293
00:52:00,533 --> 00:52:01,467
It was cute.

1294
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,400
Listen, thank you for today.

1295
00:52:03,533 --> 00:52:05,800
It's been tough doing
this without her.

1296
00:52:05,934 --> 00:52:07,400
I think it's made
me a little messy

1297
00:52:07,533 --> 00:52:09,400
in terms of how I've been
handling things around here.

1298
00:52:09,533 --> 00:52:10,700
Messy's okay sometimes.

1299
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,633
Uh, eh, it's your stop.

1300
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:19,633
I'm gonna go pick
up a few more things

1301
00:52:19,767 --> 00:52:21,066
for the soft open tomorrow.

1302
00:52:23,533 --> 00:52:24,767
Mmm-hmm.

1303
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,033
All right.

1304
00:52:26,166 --> 00:52:27,166
Uh, Frank?

1305
00:52:28,767 --> 00:52:31,133
Were you gonna ask me
out when we first met

1306
00:52:31,266 --> 00:52:32,400
at the coffee shop?

1307
00:52:32,533 --> 00:52:33,867
Is that why you were
acting so weird?

1308
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:34,900
What?

1309
00:52:35,033 --> 00:52:35,934
At?

1310
00:52:36,066 --> 00:52:37,033
The?

1311
00:52:39,266 --> 00:52:40,800
Okay, it's just
too bad, because I,

1312
00:52:40,934 --> 00:52:43,033
I think there's a chance
I might've said yes.

1313
00:52:44,934 --> 00:52:49,133
Uh.

1314
00:53:04,433 --> 00:53:05,500
She's as good as new.

1315
00:53:05,633 --> 00:53:07,200
Just in time.

1316
00:53:16,266 --> 00:53:17,967
Papa made the
perfect cappuccino.

1317
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:22,100
His secret, that extra
splash of espresso.

1318
00:54:25,033 --> 00:54:25,934
Hey, boss lady.

1319
00:54:26,066 --> 00:54:27,200
What you doin'?

1320
00:54:27,333 --> 00:54:28,767
Ah, I was just reading
about how Mama and Papa

1321
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,900
got together at
this little cafe.

1322
00:54:31,033 --> 00:54:32,867
Oh, kind of like how
you and Frank met, hmm?

1323
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,433
I know what you're implying.

1324
00:54:34,567 --> 00:54:36,233
But no, it's a little
different, actually.

1325
00:54:36,367 --> 00:54:38,033
Hmm, interesting.

1326
00:54:38,166 --> 00:54:40,867
Tell me, where did
you two go yesterday

1327
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,367
that was so important
you had to cancel

1328
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:44,934
drinks with me?

1329
00:54:45,066 --> 00:54:46,533
It was pretty important.

1330
00:54:46,667 --> 00:54:47,734
Mmm-hmm.

1331
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:49,600
We had to find a spare
part for the stove.

1332
00:54:49,734 --> 00:54:51,200
Mmm.

1333
00:54:51,333 --> 00:54:52,633
Oh, but first we went for a
little walk in Little Italy,

1334
00:54:52,767 --> 00:54:54,033
and then we went to this
cute, little flea market,

1335
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:56,100
and then to the East River.

1336
00:54:58,834 --> 00:55:00,100
He pulled a Mama.

1337
00:55:00,934 --> 00:55:01,834
A what?

1338
00:55:01,967 --> 00:55:03,600
A reverse date.

1339
00:55:03,734 --> 00:55:05,800
It's how she and
Papa got together.

1340
00:55:05,934 --> 00:55:07,400
He didn't know he was
on a date until he was

1341
00:55:07,533 --> 00:55:08,433
already on it.

1342
00:55:08,567 --> 00:55:09,967
Oh, wow, that's genius.

1343
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:11,934
She was a genius!

1344
00:55:12,066 --> 00:55:14,166
Listen, I need to go
put this stuff away,

1345
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:16,967
but this conversation
is not over.

1346
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:17,967
Okay.

1347
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:18,967
Not over, missy.

1348
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:20,066
Okay.

1349
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,467
Benvenuto.

1350
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,500
Mama's will be open
in just a few minutes.

1351
00:55:25,633 --> 00:55:27,266
I had to be first
to make a reservation.

1352
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,500
The tiramisu looks delicious.

1353
00:55:29,633 --> 00:55:30,934
I don't care what
that review said.

1354
00:55:31,066 --> 00:55:32,967
If Mama loved it, I'm
sure I'll love it, too.

1355
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:35,133
Review? What review?

1356
00:55:35,266 --> 00:55:37,100
The review from The Times.

1357
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,433
Oh, boy.

1358
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,467
He didn't tell you about this?

1359
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:43,767
No, no.

1360
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:45,300
He didn't tell his
boss that the menu

1361
00:55:45,433 --> 00:55:47,567
he's been fighting so hard for
has been panned by critics.

1362
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:48,600
One critic.

1363
00:55:48,734 --> 00:55:49,967
Kimberly Ramirez,

1364
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:51,600
the top critic in
all of New York.

1365
00:55:51,734 --> 00:55:55,100
That's the equivalent of
like 10 really good critics.

1366
00:55:55,233 --> 00:55:56,100
Fair.

1367
00:55:56,233 --> 00:55:57,333
What are you gonna do?

1368
00:55:57,467 --> 00:56:00,767
I wanted to give him a
chance, but after this?

1369
00:56:03,533 --> 00:56:05,166
We can't serve his
menu at Mama's.

1370
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:09,700
All right, everyone.

1371
00:56:09,834 --> 00:56:11,333
Gather round, please!

1372
00:56:13,133 --> 00:56:15,400
So this is our first official
run through as a team,

1373
00:56:15,533 --> 00:56:16,900
and I know that we
are going to make

1374
00:56:17,033 --> 00:56:19,000
Mama and Papa very proud.

1375
00:56:19,133 --> 00:56:21,200
So, Frank, of course, will cook.

1376
00:56:21,333 --> 00:56:22,900
Sal and Christine
will host and serve.

1377
00:56:23,033 --> 00:56:25,900
Lorenzo is going to take
care of everything else

1378
00:56:26,033 --> 00:56:27,667
with the help of our new hires,

1379
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:30,400
and Emily and I will take
orders and run the cash.

1380
00:56:30,533 --> 00:56:31,500
Sound good?

1381
00:56:31,633 --> 00:56:32,533
Really?

1382
00:56:32,667 --> 00:56:33,834
Your hard work has paid off.

1383
00:56:33,967 --> 00:56:35,400
You've just been promoted.

1384
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:39,367
Okay, okay, okay, we're
officially on a time crunch,

1385
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:40,400
so let's prep.

1386
00:56:40,533 --> 00:56:42,467
All right, all right, okay.

1387
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:43,533
Frank.

1388
00:56:43,667 --> 00:56:44,667
Yeah?

1389
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,166
About the menu, take this.

1390
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:47,333
We're gonna make some changes,

1391
00:56:47,467 --> 00:56:49,433
so if you have any
questions, let me know.

1392
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:55,567
Got it.

1393
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:57,500
So why'd the menu change?

1394
00:56:57,633 --> 00:56:58,867
We're just gonna
keep things simple

1395
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,133
so we can serve more
customers more efficiently.

1396
00:57:01,266 --> 00:57:02,133
Okay.

1397
00:57:02,266 --> 00:57:03,433
Benvenuti, welcome to Mama's.

1398
00:57:03,567 --> 00:57:05,133
All right, keep it tight.

1399
00:57:05,266 --> 00:57:06,934
Knees lookin' weak,
Tom, let's go.

1400
00:57:07,066 --> 00:57:07,967
Yup.

1401
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:08,967
Hey, how's it goin' here?

1402
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:10,133
- Oh, beautifully, Sal.
- Nice.

1403
00:57:10,266 --> 00:57:11,567
Took me all morning,
but I pre-prepped

1404
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:13,800
quite a bit of my wild
mushroom crostini,

1405
00:57:13,934 --> 00:57:15,934
branzino and pork chop frisee.

1406
00:57:16,066 --> 00:57:17,133
Uh-oh.

1407
00:57:17,266 --> 00:57:18,433
Uh-oh? What?

1408
00:57:18,567 --> 00:57:21,033
Well, you didn't look
over the new prep sheet?

1409
00:57:21,166 --> 00:57:22,066
Amy updated it.

1410
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,834
Only includes Mama's staples.

1411
00:57:24,734 --> 00:57:25,967
Not now. What?

1412
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:27,734
Yeah, it's only the staples.

1413
00:57:27,867 --> 00:57:29,133
You did prep that stuff, no?

1414
00:57:29,266 --> 00:57:30,300
Yeah, no, of course.

1415
00:57:30,433 --> 00:57:31,734
I just, I'm, I assumed
we'd be selling

1416
00:57:31,867 --> 00:57:33,633
equal amount of my items, too.

1417
00:57:33,767 --> 00:57:34,800
Oof.

1418
00:57:34,934 --> 00:57:36,734
Why would she
change the menu, Sal?

1419
00:57:36,867 --> 00:57:38,800
Hey, first order's
up for spaghetti,

1420
00:57:38,934 --> 00:57:40,600
three chicken parm,
two fettucine.

1421
00:57:40,734 --> 00:57:41,633
Three chicken parm?

1422
00:57:41,767 --> 00:57:42,934
Okay, okay, okay.

1423
00:57:43,066 --> 00:57:44,100
It's gonna take a
whole half an hour.

1424
00:57:44,233 --> 00:57:45,133
It's okay, it's
okay, we got this.

1425
00:57:45,266 --> 00:57:46,133
Let's go. Gonna help out.

1426
00:57:46,266 --> 00:57:47,133
Let's jump in.

1427
00:57:47,266 --> 00:57:48,200
The three chicken parms
all day, let's go.

1428
00:57:48,333 --> 00:57:49,967
- Enjoy.
- Thank goodness.

1429
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:51,233
What is going on back there?

1430
00:57:51,367 --> 00:57:52,433
Well, Frank didn't
prep enough of Mama's

1431
00:57:52,567 --> 00:57:53,633
signature dishes.

1432
00:57:53,767 --> 00:57:54,633
What, didn't he
get the changes?

1433
00:57:54,767 --> 00:57:56,567
- I don't know.
- Well, what happened?

1434
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:57,567
Why didn't you tell me
you made these changes?

1435
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:58,934
- You tryin' to set me up?
- Set you up?

1436
00:57:59,066 --> 00:57:59,934
I gave you the folder.

1437
00:58:00,133 --> 00:58:01,300
All you had to do was open it.

1438
00:58:01,433 --> 00:58:02,967
We agreed to use
my menu, remember?

1439
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:04,467
Yeah, that was before
I knew about the review

1440
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:05,500
in The Times.

1441
00:58:05,633 --> 00:58:07,300
Oh, this is not good.

1442
00:58:07,433 --> 00:58:09,367
I was gonna, I was
gonna tell you about that.

1443
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:10,800
When?

1444
00:58:10,934 --> 00:58:12,133
A few weeks from now
after we already reopened?

1445
00:58:12,266 --> 00:58:13,633
I was waiting
for the right time.

1446
00:58:13,767 --> 00:58:15,467
You know what, it's really
hard to work with someone

1447
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:18,800
who doesn't reciprocate
trust and honesty

1448
00:58:18,934 --> 00:58:20,200
and communication.

1449
00:58:20,333 --> 00:58:21,200
Amy.

1450
00:58:21,333 --> 00:58:22,200
I thought we had that.

1451
00:58:22,333 --> 00:58:23,467
I thought we were friends.

1452
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:28,500
Okay, guess I was wrong.

1453
00:58:28,633 --> 00:58:29,667
All right.

1454
00:58:43,133 --> 00:58:46,400
No, look, I mean, this
is almost an exact replica.

1455
00:58:46,533 --> 00:58:48,166
You know, I mean, almost.

1456
00:58:49,867 --> 00:58:52,400
I haven't been able to say
goodbye to Galaxy Blast yet.

1457
00:58:52,533 --> 00:58:55,233
Are you still thinking
about leaving for another job?

1458
00:58:55,367 --> 00:58:56,900
My interview's this afternoon.

1459
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:58,400
It's a new era here, Sal.

1460
00:58:58,533 --> 00:59:00,066
I'm just in the way.

1461
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,066
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait a second.

1462
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,066
You've never given up
on anything this easily.

1463
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,633
What aren't you telling me?

1464
00:59:05,767 --> 00:59:06,633
Huh?

1465
00:59:06,767 --> 00:59:07,633
It's Amy, isn't it?

1466
00:59:07,767 --> 00:59:09,100
See, I knew it.

1467
00:59:09,233 --> 00:59:10,633
Listen, you go in there,
you just be honest with her.

1468
00:59:10,767 --> 00:59:12,400
You lay it all out, you earn
some of that trust back.

1469
00:59:12,533 --> 00:59:14,133
It's not that
simple, Sal, okay?

1470
00:59:14,266 --> 00:59:16,266
Being here is just
not my destino,

1471
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:17,500
and I've accepted that.

1472
00:59:20,033 --> 00:59:22,233
Had a lot of good times
together, old pal.

1473
00:59:22,367 --> 00:59:23,400
Yeah.

1474
00:59:23,533 --> 00:59:24,967
Yeah, we have.

1475
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:31,800
You can help
me haul this in the back.

1476
00:59:31,934 --> 00:59:33,600
Yeah.

1477
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:42,734
Pasta primavera
was Amy's favorite.

1478
00:59:49,567 --> 00:59:50,600
Mama?

1479
00:59:50,734 --> 00:59:51,800
Amy!

1480
00:59:51,934 --> 00:59:53,066
Just in time.

1481
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,800
I'm making your
favorite, primavera.

1482
00:59:54,934 --> 00:59:56,233
Can we talk?

1483
00:59:56,367 --> 00:59:57,433
Sure.

1484
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:59,967
You talk, I listen,
and I make primavera.

1485
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:02,734
It's what we do.

1486
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:07,967
I got a job offer.

1487
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:09,734
Chow.

1488
01:00:09,867 --> 01:00:10,967
In Midtown.

1489
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:12,934
They're looking for
an assistant manager.

1490
01:00:13,066 --> 01:00:14,033
Oh.

1491
01:00:16,367 --> 01:00:19,934
Um.

1492
01:00:20,066 --> 01:00:22,400
You should take it.

1493
01:00:22,533 --> 01:00:23,567
Really?

1494
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:24,767
Well, yeah.

1495
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:27,567
You know the restaurant
business in and out.

1496
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:30,233
Papa and I have
taught you everything.

1497
01:00:30,367 --> 01:00:33,133
It's about time you got
to, uh, spread your wings

1498
01:00:33,266 --> 01:00:36,800
and show the world
what you have to offer.

1499
01:00:36,934 --> 01:00:40,100
I know, but this is the
only place I've ever worked,

1500
01:00:40,233 --> 01:00:41,800
and it's so scary.

1501
01:00:41,934 --> 01:00:44,066
You have to take
risks in order to have

1502
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:47,533
a rich, fulfilling,
successful life.

1503
01:00:49,266 --> 01:00:53,734
Imagine if I stayed in the
same place my whole life.

1504
01:00:53,867 --> 01:00:57,800
Well, all this would've
never have come to be, right?

1505
01:00:57,934 --> 01:00:58,900
Yeah.

1506
01:01:02,133 --> 01:01:05,667
How am I suppose to leave you?

1507
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:10,033
You know, when I lost
Papa all those years ago,

1508
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:11,467
I had two choices.

1509
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,367
I could continue to grieve,

1510
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:16,300
or I could live life,

1511
01:01:16,433 --> 01:01:19,633
loving the people who
are right in front of me.

1512
01:01:19,767 --> 01:01:21,433
People like you.

1513
01:01:23,333 --> 01:01:25,200
And it was hard losing Papa,

1514
01:01:25,333 --> 01:01:27,467
and it'll be hard
when you leave.

1515
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,700
But, Amy, you'll never
get the chance to spread

1516
01:01:31,834 --> 01:01:35,467
the love that you found here

1517
01:01:37,433 --> 01:01:41,533
if I don't let you go.

1518
01:01:43,767 --> 01:01:46,667
I'll come visit you
all the time, I promise.

1519
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:47,767
My tesoro.

1520
01:01:49,166 --> 01:01:51,633
Thank you for everything
you've done for me.

1521
01:01:51,767 --> 01:01:53,800
You've done so
much more for me.

1522
01:01:56,333 --> 01:01:57,433
We need a picture together.

1523
01:01:57,567 --> 01:01:58,467
We need a photo.

1524
01:01:58,600 --> 01:01:59,467
Okay.

1525
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:00,533
- Okay.
- Okay.

1526
01:02:00,667 --> 01:02:01,567
Will you take a picture of us?

1527
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:03,200
Thank you.

1528
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,367
Tiramisu di
Franco is a sweet reminder

1529
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:20,533
of the importance
of moving forward.

1530
01:02:20,667 --> 01:02:24,867
Why'd you leave your
last job, Frank?

1531
01:02:27,567 --> 01:02:28,767
Eh, what the heck.

1532
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:30,033
It's like my 10th interview
and no one's given

1533
01:02:30,166 --> 01:02:31,200
me a shot yet and
why should they?

1534
01:02:32,333 --> 01:02:33,200
I was too proud.

1535
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:35,367
I wanted to cook a certain way,

1536
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:37,100
my manager disagreed,

1537
01:02:37,233 --> 01:02:38,700
and I was let go.

1538
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,433
I deserved it.

1539
01:02:43,567 --> 01:02:46,600
I had passion, but
I wasn't the boss.

1540
01:02:46,734 --> 01:02:50,633
Lesson learned, right?

1541
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:51,734
Thank you for your time.

1542
01:02:51,867 --> 01:02:53,266
I'll see myself out.

1543
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:54,266
Appreciate it.

1544
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:55,500
No, no, come on, sit.

1545
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:57,867
You want an espresso?

1546
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:58,967
Uh, sure?

1547
01:03:00,133 --> 01:03:01,000
Okay.

1548
01:03:01,133 --> 01:03:03,200
Duo, espresso, per favore.

1549
01:03:05,467 --> 01:03:07,600
Eh, relax.

1550
01:03:07,734 --> 01:03:09,500
I appreciate your honesty.

1551
01:03:09,633 --> 01:03:10,967
Yeah, blessing and a curse.

1552
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:13,066
I know that well.

1553
01:03:15,266 --> 01:03:18,166
So what is it that
motivates you?

1554
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:20,600
I mean, why do you wanna cook?

1555
01:03:21,767 --> 01:03:25,500
Cookin' to me,
it's, it's, it's food.

1556
01:03:25,633 --> 01:03:27,333
Food is my safe place.

1557
01:03:27,467 --> 01:03:30,767
It's my nonna and my
mom in the kitchen,

1558
01:03:31,934 --> 01:03:33,433
whippin' up some maccugan dish.

1559
01:03:33,567 --> 01:03:38,000
It's garlic and the olive
oil simmering in the pan.

1560
01:03:38,133 --> 01:03:39,367
Best smell in the world.

1561
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,767
And it's just feeling
instantly better

1562
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:45,934
when you walk in your
house, and you know,

1563
01:03:46,066 --> 01:03:48,367
the sounds and the smells
of the kitchen, you know?

1564
01:03:51,233 --> 01:03:54,266
It's love, it's family.

1565
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:55,266
That's what I wanna do.

1566
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,200
I wanna, I wanna make a place

1567
01:03:58,567 --> 01:04:00,166
for love, laughter and family.

1568
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:02,567
That simple, really.

1569
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:04,333
It's all I wanna do.

1570
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,200
Okay.

1571
01:04:13,533 --> 01:04:15,400
I can offer you a
couple of things.

1572
01:04:15,533 --> 01:04:18,200
I can offer you a lot
of garlic and olive oil

1573
01:04:18,333 --> 01:04:20,333
and a lot of fun in the kitchen.

1574
01:04:20,467 --> 01:04:22,233
Does that interest you?

1575
01:04:22,367 --> 01:04:24,233
You won't regret
this, Mrs. Tucci.

1576
01:04:24,367 --> 01:04:25,500
I'm your guy, for sure.

1577
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:28,233
Call me Mama.

1578
01:04:28,367 --> 01:04:29,400
Of course, Mama.

1579
01:04:31,967 --> 01:04:32,900
Salute.

1580
01:04:33,033 --> 01:04:34,700
Salute.

1581
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:39,900
Menu's prepped for tonight.

1582
01:04:40,033 --> 01:04:41,400
Just experimenting
with a new dish.

1583
01:04:41,533 --> 01:04:43,166
Mmm, duck?

1584
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:44,567
Duck sugo.

1585
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:46,100
Hmm.

1586
01:04:46,233 --> 01:04:48,367
You know, Frank, you've been
doing a fantastic job here.

1587
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:51,066
You proved me right
by hiring you.

1588
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,066
What can I say?

1589
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:53,333
I'm a changed man.

1590
01:04:53,467 --> 01:04:55,900
Well, I'm gonna take a
little advice from Papa,

1591
01:04:56,033 --> 01:04:59,734
and you know that I'm not
really that good at change.

1592
01:04:59,867 --> 01:05:00,967
No.

1593
01:05:02,934 --> 01:05:04,166
But, um.

1594
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:08,800
What's this?

1595
01:05:08,934 --> 01:05:12,200
Every artist starts
with a blank canvas.

1596
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:16,800
You should make it your own.

1597
01:05:16,934 --> 01:05:17,800
Me?

1598
01:05:17,934 --> 01:05:18,900
You're ah...

1599
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:22,467
You trust me to
create my own menu?

1600
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,934
You think you would
like to do that?

1601
01:05:25,066 --> 01:05:26,433
Absolutely, yes!

1602
01:05:26,567 --> 01:05:27,967
Yeah, I've been workin'
on a recipe for tiramisu.

1603
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:28,967
I think it'll be fantastic.

1604
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:30,233
Oh, great.

1605
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:31,500
Let's serve it tonight.

1606
01:05:33,767 --> 01:05:35,066
Yes!

1607
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:44,300
Mmm.

1608
01:05:44,433 --> 01:05:45,734
There you are.

1609
01:05:45,867 --> 01:05:47,633
We put the finishing
touches in the dining room,

1610
01:05:47,767 --> 01:05:49,900
and I put out a
basket of my biscotti.

1611
01:05:51,533 --> 01:05:52,433
Are you okay?

1612
01:05:52,567 --> 01:05:54,567
I've been doing it all wrong.

1613
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:55,767
Doing what wrong?

1614
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:57,734
Taking Mama's
back to square one.

1615
01:05:59,367 --> 01:06:01,700
It's not what she wanted.

1616
01:06:07,633 --> 01:06:10,000
d we he

1617
01:06:10,133 --> 01:06:12,667
some final prep work to do.

1618
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:14,367
Where's Frank?

1619
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:15,567
- Frank?
- Yeah.

1620
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:17,000
Frank stepped
out to the market.

1621
01:06:17,133 --> 01:06:19,033
Uh, eh, grab some
tomatoes and peppers

1622
01:06:19,166 --> 01:06:20,033
and things like that.

1623
01:06:20,166 --> 01:06:21,934
Oh.

1624
01:06:22,066 --> 01:06:23,033
Bummer.

1625
01:06:23,166 --> 01:06:24,867
He's gonna miss the good news.

1626
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,367
Change of plans.

1627
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:29,333
We're gonna reincorporate
his items into the menu.

1628
01:06:29,467 --> 01:06:30,700
- Nice.
- Yeah, okay?

1629
01:06:30,834 --> 01:06:31,700
Okay.

1630
01:06:31,834 --> 01:06:32,800
Cool.

1631
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:35,834
Okay, look.

1632
01:06:35,967 --> 01:06:36,834
Don't panic, but
Frank's actually at

1633
01:06:36,967 --> 01:06:38,400
a job interview right now.

1634
01:06:38,533 --> 01:06:39,667
- What?
- Yeah.

1635
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:40,867
That seems like a
great reason to panic.

1636
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:41,867
He can't leave.

1637
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,500
I know.

1638
01:06:43,633 --> 01:06:45,500
Well, we gotta get
'em to make up.

1639
01:06:45,633 --> 01:06:46,700
Yeah, but how?

1640
01:06:46,834 --> 01:06:47,800
How what?

1641
01:06:49,367 --> 01:06:51,500
How beautiful is that coat?

1642
01:06:51,633 --> 01:06:52,533
Is it new?

1643
01:06:52,667 --> 01:06:53,567
Yeah, it's beautiful.

1644
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:55,233
Where you headin'?

1645
01:06:55,367 --> 01:06:56,233
To talk to Frank.

1646
01:06:56,367 --> 01:06:57,533
Did he go to Prospect Park?

1647
01:06:57,667 --> 01:06:58,633
46th Street.

1648
01:06:58,767 --> 01:06:59,667
Manhattan?

1649
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:00,967
What's he doing in Manhattan?

1650
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:02,233
Well, have you seen
the stock of tomatoes?

1651
01:07:02,367 --> 01:07:03,266
The best in New York.

1652
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:04,467
You know Frank.

1653
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:05,767
Always going above
and beyond, so.

1654
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:08,967
Yeah, and I mean, I'm
sure he'll be back soon.

1655
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:10,266
You may as well just
wait for him here.

1656
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,266
No, I, I need some fresh air.

1657
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:13,266
I'll see you in a bit.

1658
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:14,367
Yeah, see ya.

1659
01:07:16,033 --> 01:07:16,934
So you're calling him, right?

1660
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:18,300
Yeah.

1661
01:07:20,567 --> 01:07:21,900
Oh.

1662
01:07:22,033 --> 01:07:22,900
Hey.

1663
01:07:23,033 --> 01:07:25,400
Hey, so how'd it go?

1664
01:07:25,533 --> 01:07:26,900
Couldn't of gone better.

1665
01:07:28,266 --> 01:07:29,400
That's great.

1666
01:07:29,533 --> 01:07:30,800
More importantly,
I realized something.

1667
01:07:30,934 --> 01:07:33,133
I think I know what my
recipes have been missing.

1668
01:07:33,266 --> 01:07:34,633
Yeah, you can tell
me about that later.

1669
01:07:34,767 --> 01:07:36,734
Look, Amy's been
lookin' for you.

1670
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:38,967
You didn't-

1671
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:40,133
I didn't tell her
about the interview, no.

1672
01:07:40,266 --> 01:07:41,433
Head over to the
46th Street market.

1673
01:07:41,567 --> 01:07:42,633
I told her you were
picking up tomatoes.

1674
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:43,633
Okay, on it.

1675
01:07:43,767 --> 01:07:44,734
Hey, thanks for covering.

1676
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:06,700
Frank.

1677
01:08:06,834 --> 01:08:08,133
Hey.
- Amy, uh?

1678
01:08:09,266 --> 01:08:11,300
What are you doing here?

1679
01:08:11,433 --> 01:08:14,200
Uh, I actually came

1680
01:08:14,333 --> 01:08:15,967
to apologize.

1681
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:17,000
You did?

1682
01:08:17,133 --> 01:08:18,500
Yeah.

1683
01:08:18,633 --> 01:08:19,867
I went a little overboard
trying to replicate Mama's,

1684
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,100
and I shouldn't of dismissed
your contributions.

1685
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:27,700
I was just so set on
making Mama proud that I,

1686
01:08:27,834 --> 01:08:32,133
I kind of lost sight
of that very thing.

1687
01:08:32,266 --> 01:08:33,467
What do you mean?

1688
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:36,000
I was reading
through her cookbook,

1689
01:08:36,133 --> 01:08:37,767
and she included your recipes.

1690
01:08:39,266 --> 01:08:40,700
I didn't realize she
had so much fait in you,

1691
01:08:40,834 --> 01:08:44,266
and I didn't realize that she
was ready to embrace change.

1692
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:48,867
Yeah, well, it
wasn't exactly working.

1693
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,533
Well, maybe that's
because you were only

1694
01:08:51,667 --> 01:08:52,800
one half of a team.

1695
01:08:57,166 --> 01:08:58,934
I wanna move forward
with your menu.

1696
01:09:00,133 --> 01:09:01,033
You do?

1697
01:09:01,166 --> 01:09:02,033
Yeah.

1698
01:09:02,166 --> 01:09:04,200
Mama's wishes should come first.

1699
01:09:04,333 --> 01:09:07,233
And who cares what some
critic thinks, right?

1700
01:09:07,367 --> 01:09:09,533
You know, I was really
embarrassed the other night

1701
01:09:09,667 --> 01:09:10,934
at the soft open.

1702
01:09:11,066 --> 01:09:12,433
Now I know I had
some fault, too.

1703
01:09:12,567 --> 01:09:14,100
I should've talked to
you earlier one-on-one.

1704
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:16,700
I shouldn't have done that
in front of all those people.

1705
01:09:17,734 --> 01:09:21,233
Hey, can we still be friends?

1706
01:09:23,166 --> 01:09:24,166
Friends again.

1707
01:09:25,834 --> 01:09:29,400
I'll see ya back at Mama's.

1708
01:09:51,734 --> 01:09:53,033
Dear Amy.

1709
01:09:53,166 --> 01:09:56,300
A new friend inspired
me to write this letter.

1710
01:09:57,166 --> 01:10:00,934
Hey, Mama, I was, uh...

1711
01:10:01,066 --> 01:10:02,767
Is everything okay?

1712
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:05,533
Yeah, it's okay.

1713
01:10:05,667 --> 01:10:06,700
I, uh.

1714
01:10:08,567 --> 01:10:12,066
I'm just thinkin'
about some of my life

1715
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:15,934
and one big regret.

1716
01:10:16,066 --> 01:10:17,667
Yeah, I've got
plenty of those.

1717
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:24,934
You wanna tell me about it?

1718
01:10:25,066 --> 01:10:28,100
I had a special friend.

1719
01:10:28,233 --> 01:10:31,266
Mio tesoro.

1720
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:35,600
And we had this falling
out and it was really

1721
01:10:35,734 --> 01:10:38,367
all my fault because
I had such a big,

1722
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:42,266
emotional reaction
and I pushed her away,

1723
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:46,700
and you know, life
goes by, time flies,

1724
01:10:46,834 --> 01:10:49,033
and we all get busy.

1725
01:10:50,066 --> 01:10:53,600
And we lost touch.

1726
01:10:53,734 --> 01:10:56,266
Well, I believe
someone taught me

1727
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:59,100
that true friendship
can withstand anything.

1728
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:02,734
What would you do if
you were in my shoes?

1729
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:06,667
I'd write a letter.

1730
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,633
I think there's something
special and comforting

1731
01:11:08,767 --> 01:11:10,133
about receiving a tangible
memory that can be

1732
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:11,433
held onto forever.

1733
01:11:13,233 --> 01:11:14,600
I was a shy kid.

1734
01:11:14,734 --> 01:11:17,266
I wrote girls little notes
and poems all the time.

1735
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:18,433
I don't know.

1736
01:11:18,567 --> 01:11:19,633
What a romantic.

1737
01:11:19,767 --> 01:11:21,233
Oh, yeah, right.

1738
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:25,433
You know, you're both
about the same age,

1739
01:11:25,567 --> 01:11:29,100
and I, I do hope
one day you meet.

1740
01:11:29,233 --> 01:11:32,166
Yeah, I'm not so
great at relationships.

1741
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:34,600
She'd really be having
to compromise with me.

1742
01:11:34,734 --> 01:11:35,767
Mmm.

1743
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:36,767
Hey, when do you
leave for Napoli?

1744
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:37,867
Tomorrow night.

1745
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:43,333
All right, have fun.

1746
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:46,100
Don't eat too much gnocci.

1747
01:11:47,233 --> 01:11:48,467
Water my plants.

1748
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:50,033
I got it, I got it.

1749
01:11:58,633 --> 01:12:01,166
I'm sorry that
we've fallen out of touch.

1750
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:05,000
I take responsibility
for how I reacted,

1751
01:12:05,133 --> 01:12:08,500
but the wonderful thing
about relationships is,

1752
01:12:08,633 --> 01:12:11,667
they can withstand
just about anything.

1753
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:14,500
Life might change
and time may pass,

1754
01:12:14,633 --> 01:12:16,734
but family is forever.

1755
01:12:16,867 --> 01:12:18,667
Papa taught me that.

1756
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:21,500
And just like Papa, no
matter where you are,

1757
01:12:21,633 --> 01:12:23,834
I'll always be there with you.

1758
01:12:23,967 --> 01:12:26,400
Love always, Mama.

1759
01:12:39,333 --> 01:12:43,500
Frank, wait.

1760
01:12:43,633 --> 01:12:44,500
What's this?

1761
01:12:44,633 --> 01:12:45,700
I found it in Mama's cookbook.

1762
01:12:45,834 --> 01:12:47,333
She hadn't sent it to me.

1763
01:12:47,467 --> 01:12:49,967
Did you tell her to
write this letter?

1764
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,233
This is the closure
I never had with her

1765
01:12:57,367 --> 01:12:59,100
and you helped me find that.

1766
01:13:01,867 --> 01:13:05,734
You have no idea what
this means to me.

1767
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:09,233
Frank.

1768
01:13:09,367 --> 01:13:10,400
Hey.

1769
01:13:10,533 --> 01:13:11,400
Sorry to interrupt.

1770
01:13:11,533 --> 01:13:13,266
This'll just take a moment.

1771
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:14,567
I don't know if you're aware,

1772
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:15,967
but this guy is one
tough nut to crack.

1773
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:17,767
He just won't give
me a straight answer.

1774
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:20,100
Look, Frank, I came by
tonight to see if there's

1775
01:13:20,233 --> 01:13:22,467
anything else I can do
to sweeten the deal.

1776
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:25,367
Now we would love to have
you as head chef at Reggio's.

1777
01:13:27,066 --> 01:13:29,233
Come on. How about it?

1778
01:13:35,867 --> 01:13:38,934
Amy, wait.

1779
01:13:45,467 --> 01:13:46,433
Benvenuti.

1780
01:13:46,567 --> 01:13:48,433
Welcome to Mama's.

1781
01:13:48,567 --> 01:13:51,133
I hope you enjoy your
experience here tonight.

1782
01:13:51,266 --> 01:13:52,600
Take a trip down
memory lane with us,

1783
01:13:52,734 --> 01:13:54,967
but keep an open mind, because
we have some new treats

1784
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:56,100
for you, as well.

1785
01:13:56,233 --> 01:13:57,834
Okay, come on in.

1786
01:14:02,033 --> 01:14:03,166
Hey, welcome. Welcome back.

1787
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:04,266
Come on in.

1788
01:14:06,033 --> 01:14:07,667
One for you.

1789
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:10,333
And the wine list
is on the back.

1790
01:14:10,467 --> 01:14:11,734
I gotta tell ya,

1791
01:14:11,867 --> 01:14:12,900
there's something
different about you lately.

1792
01:14:13,033 --> 01:14:14,667
I feel revitalized, Sal.

1793
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:15,900
I do.
- Yeah.

1794
01:14:16,033 --> 01:14:17,533
Finally took the
time to slow down

1795
01:14:17,667 --> 01:14:20,000
and reconnect with what
I'm doing, you know?

1796
01:14:20,133 --> 01:14:21,200
Try this, try this.
- Nice.

1797
01:14:21,333 --> 01:14:22,500
Okay.
- What do you think?

1798
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:25,834
That's delicious.

1799
01:14:25,967 --> 01:14:27,000
You are back, baby.

1800
01:14:27,133 --> 01:14:28,100
I'm back, baby.

1801
01:14:29,633 --> 01:14:31,133
It's too bad being back
actually means you're leaving,

1802
01:14:31,266 --> 01:14:32,166
but, eh.

1803
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:33,166
Aw, come on.

1804
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:34,166
Don't, don't do that.

1805
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:35,667
Oh, how I'll
miss you constantly

1806
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:36,900
shovin' down your emotions, huh?

1807
01:14:37,033 --> 01:14:38,433
It's not like we won't
be friends anymore, Sal.

1808
01:14:38,567 --> 01:14:39,500
I know.

1809
01:14:39,633 --> 01:14:41,533
I'm being dramatic.

1810
01:14:41,667 --> 01:14:43,166
Have you had a chance
to talk to Amy yet?

1811
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:44,166
What do you think?

1812
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:45,166
I think you should
tell her how you feel.

1813
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:46,166
I meant the-

1814
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:47,500
I know you meant the branzino.

1815
01:14:47,633 --> 01:14:48,500
But you're leaving.

1816
01:14:48,633 --> 01:14:49,700
What have you got to lose?

1817
01:14:49,834 --> 01:14:50,967
Wasn't Mama all
about taking risks?

1818
01:14:53,633 --> 01:14:55,900

Yeah.

1824
01:15:09,066 --> 01:15:10,467
Frank really turned things
around since the soft open.

1825
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:13,166
Guess your communication's
finally improved.

1826
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:17,233
Better late than never.

1827
01:15:17,367 --> 01:15:19,100
I am proud of you, you know?

1828
01:15:19,233 --> 01:15:20,734
For letting him go.

1829
01:15:20,867 --> 01:15:21,934
Well.

1830
01:15:22,066 --> 01:15:22,967
I mean, it's what he wants.

Oh, sorry.

No, my fault.

1837
01:15:33,867 --> 01:15:35,600
Listen to us apologizing.

1838
01:15:35,734 --> 01:15:37,400
You'd never guess two
weeks ago we were the most

1839
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:39,266
stubborn two people
on the planet.

1840
01:15:41,433 --> 01:15:43,233
Uh, about me leaving.

So Sal will step in
while we find a chef,

1843
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:49,600
and Christine will be our
resident baker, and that's it.

1844
01:15:49,734 --> 01:15:51,100
We're totally covered.

1845
01:15:51,233 --> 01:15:52,200
Don't worry.

You're very welcome.

1863
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:28,367
It's good to see you.
- You, too.

1864
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:29,367
I'm afraid I didn't
make a reservation.

1865

- Ooh.

Well, thanks, Mig.

1867
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:32,967
Ah, might be tough tonight.

1868
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:34,200
No, no, I'm joking.

1869

Frank.

1873
01:16:41,266 --> 01:16:42,500
Giving us another chance, huh?

1874
01:16:42,633 --> 01:16:44,467
I couldn't miss
the grand re-opening.

01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:45,667
Ah.

1876
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:48,033

missing ingredient.

1877

Please.

1880
01:17:01,333 --> 01:17:03,266
This is

1881
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:05,033
a Masseto.

1882
01:17:05,166 --> 01:17:06,433
It was Mama's favorite wine.

1883
01:17:06,567 --> 01:17:09,533
It wasn't because of the flavor

1884
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:12,533
or the steep price tag,
even though she did

1885
01:17:12,667 --> 01:17:14,600
have champagne tastes, oh yes.

1886
01:17:16,333 --> 01:17:17,367
It was her favorite

1887
01:17:19,033 --> 01:17:21,266
because she shared it with Papa.

1888
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:22,533
Aww.

1889
01:17:22,667 --> 01:17:24,867
Their dedication

love for one another

Frank, he's in the back
cleaning up, I think.

- Okay.

1924
01:19:01,333 --> 01:19:02,734
But it's your move.

1925
01:19:02,867 --> 01:19:03,834
- Okay, uh.
- Yeah, go.

1926
01:19:03,967 --> 01:19:05,000
- Take over for me.
- Yeah.

1927
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,033
Oh, hey.

1928
01:19:10,166 --> 01:19:11,834
I thought you left
without saying goodbye.

1930
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:16,834

I have a feeling
it will turn up.

1937
01:19:47,033 --> 01:19:49,400
No, but how could I lose it?

1938
01:19:49,533 --> 01:19:50,900

who wants to see you.

Amy, getting to know you

1941
01:20:08,133 --> 01:20:09,600
has made me realize somethin'.

1942
01:20:11,166 --> 01:20:14,066
Mama made the right choice in
leaving you the restaurant.

1943
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:15,934
I also realized somethin' else.

1944
01:20:17,133 --> 01:20:18,700
Please meet me where
the room has no walls,

1945
01:20:18,834 --> 01:20:20,166
where the ceiling breaks,

1946
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:22,266

1947
01:20:40,967 --> 01:20:42,333
I thought you might wanna
celebrate a great evening

1948
01:20:42,467 --> 01:20:44,033

1949
01:20:44,166 --> 01:20:45,200
When did you do all this?

1950
01:20:45,333 --> 01:20:46,834
I snuck away in my down time.

1951
01:20:47,867 --> 01:20:52,500
Picked up a few tips from Papa.

1952
01:20:52,633 --> 01:20:54,867
Your famous tiramisu.

1953
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,166
The one and only.

1954
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:58,900
Of course I could order
you some chocolate pudding

1955

instead, if you like.

1956

It's perfect.

1957
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:06,266
Dining room looks
a little messy

1958
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:08,233

machine in there.

1959

I knew it.

1974

take you on a reverse date.

01:21:57,700 --> 01:22:00,633
What I didn't expect was,

1977
01:22:00,767 --> 01:22:04,467
was how much you helped me.

1978
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:06,133
You kept Mama's memory
alive when I was

1979
01:22:06,266 --> 01:22:07,333
trying to run from it,

1980
01:22:07,467 --> 01:22:09,033
and that's exactly
when I needed to find

1981
01:22:09,166 --> 01:22:10,467
my passion again.

1982
01:22:12,433 --> 01:22:15,367
How can I thank you?

1983
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:17,300
Thank me by staying.

1985
01:22:20,433 --> 01:22:22,433
I'll make you an offer.

1986
01:22:23,667 --> 01:22:24,867
I'm listening.

1987
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,633
Let's be co-owners.

1988
01:22:28,133 --> 01:22:29,367
That's a bold offer.

1989
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:32,400
I can be bold sometimes, too.

1990
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,700
I changed my mind.

1991
01:22:37,834 --> 01:22:40,533
I decided to turn down the job.

1992
01:22:40,667 --> 01:22:41,967
You did?

1993
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:43,467
It was risky.

1994
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:47,800
Could've been the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1995
01:22:47,934 --> 01:22:51,133
But then I realized
I already had that.

1996
01:22:53,433 --> 01:22:56,867
It was right in front
of me the whole time.

1999

You know, Mama left the
rest of her cookbook blank,

2000
01:23:12,333 --> 01:23:16,200
so what do you say we pick
up where she left off?

2001
01:23:16,333 --> 01:23:18,433
Carry on her legacy?

2002
01:23:18,567 --> 01:23:19,700
Mmm-hmm.

2003
01:23:19,834 --> 01:23:21,266
Well, this is one time
I can confidently say

2004
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:24,300
that is exactly what
Mama would want.
