1
00:00:44,561 --> 00:00:46,701
I can't go with you tomorrow.

2
00:00:46,805 --> 00:00:48,255
What?
Why not?

3
00:00:48,358 --> 00:00:51,154
I'm grounded indefinitely.

4
00:00:51,258 --> 00:00:54,123
How did you get grounded?

5
00:00:54,226 --> 00:00:56,884
My mom found the books
and then lost her mind.

6
00:00:56,987 --> 00:00:59,093
She made me return them.

7
00:00:59,197 --> 00:01:01,199
I think she'd rather find pot
in my room

8
00:01:01,302 --> 00:01:03,063
than a book on Ashland Falls.

9
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:04,823
That's messed up.

10
00:01:04,926 --> 00:01:06,204
Well, what did you do?

11
00:01:06,307 --> 00:01:08,137
I returned them.

12
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,416
She drove me to the library
and watched me do it.

13
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:13,763
And she was mad -- like, mad.

14
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:17,422
Well, listen.
I think my theory was right.

15
00:01:17,525 --> 00:01:20,321
You have a new theory
on this house every day.

16
00:01:20,425 --> 00:01:23,704
We are looking
in the wrong places.

17
00:01:23,807 --> 00:01:27,880
The town borders
not only changed, they shrunk.

18
00:01:27,984 --> 00:01:29,296
How'd you know?

19
00:01:29,399 --> 00:01:31,194
It all goes back
to the power gr--

20
00:01:31,298 --> 00:01:33,852
Uh, just a minute!

21
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,170
Come in!

22
00:01:43,758 --> 00:01:45,622
I said come in.

23
00:01:45,726 --> 00:01:47,728
Ashley.

24
00:01:47,831 --> 00:01:49,868
I thought you said your parents
were taking your brother

25
00:01:49,971 --> 00:01:51,214
to college.

26
00:02:10,475 --> 00:02:11,752
Ash.

27
00:02:18,586 --> 00:02:19,794
Ash.

28
00:02:26,007 --> 00:02:28,148
Jesus, Ash.

29
00:02:28,251 --> 00:02:29,839
Stop freaking me out, okay?

30
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:32,738
It's probably Jesse
just messing with me.

31
00:02:32,842 --> 00:02:36,328
Are you sure?
Do you want me to call someone?

32
00:02:36,673 --> 00:02:39,159
No. No.
It's...

33
00:02:39,262 --> 00:02:40,953
It's fine.

34
00:03:24,065 --> 00:03:27,241
There's...nobody here.

35
00:03:27,345 --> 00:03:29,001
Want to come over?

36
00:03:32,073 --> 00:03:33,903
No.

37
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:35,594
No.
It's fine.

38
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,922
Natalie?

39
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,053
It's nice.

40
00:04:21,157 --> 00:04:25,126
It's definitely better than
the last place Bonnie showed us.

41
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,405
Uh, I only showed you
that last place

42
00:04:27,508 --> 00:04:29,338
to get it out of your system

43
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:32,168
because I knew you would
keep asking me about it.

44
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,653
You know us well.

45
00:04:34,757 --> 00:04:39,762
Now, this place is about the
same price, but twice the space.

46
00:04:39,865 --> 00:04:41,626
How can that be?

47
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:44,629
- Sounds like a red flag, right?
- Mm. Could be a red flag.

48
00:04:44,732 --> 00:04:47,804
But it's been on the market
for about three years,

49
00:04:47,908 --> 00:04:50,255
and the sellers are
very motivated.

50
00:04:56,365 --> 00:04:57,435
Where is Isabel?

51
00:04:57,538 --> 00:04:59,713
I think she's still in the car.

52
00:04:59,816 --> 00:05:01,611
Stop worrying about your sister.

53
00:05:01,715 --> 00:05:04,649
Any place is better
than a freshman dorm room.

54
00:05:04,752 --> 00:05:08,584
And this place definitely has
enough room for Isabel.

55
00:05:08,687 --> 00:05:11,380
Uh -- Oh. She is still
going to live with you?

56
00:05:11,483 --> 00:05:13,313
- Isn't that still the plan?
- Yeah.

57
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,763
At least for her first semester.

58
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:18,525
Well, I guess I can finally get
my piano.

59
00:05:20,492 --> 00:05:23,081
Hey, Izzy.
What do you think?

60
00:05:23,184 --> 00:05:25,394
Oh, and, uh, congratulations
on your scholarship.

61
00:05:25,497 --> 00:05:26,981
Thanks, Bonnie.

62
00:05:27,085 --> 00:05:28,673
I'm sure your mother would be
very proud.

63
00:05:28,776 --> 00:05:30,330
She would.

64
00:05:30,433 --> 00:05:33,229
And this place has tons of space
for your art.

65
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,231
You still do that, right?

66
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,681
Art?

67
00:05:37,854 --> 00:05:40,029
It's what she got
the scholarship for.

68
00:05:41,306 --> 00:05:43,343
Uh, so...

69
00:06:01,809 --> 00:06:05,261
There's at least two leaks
in the master bedroom.

70
00:06:05,675 --> 00:06:08,506
It even got to the first floor.

71
00:06:08,609 --> 00:06:10,611
I'm looking at the living room
right now.

72
00:06:10,715 --> 00:06:13,096
The living room?
How bad is it?

73
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,858
It's a mess, Bonnie.

74
00:06:15,961 --> 00:06:19,551
I can send someone out
this afternoon and take a look.

75
00:06:19,655 --> 00:06:21,381
Are you sure it's not
a plumbing problem?

76
00:06:21,484 --> 00:06:23,555
Old pipes can leak,
too, you know.

77
00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:25,799
Yeah, I-I'm pretty sure.

78
00:06:25,902 --> 00:06:27,939
But the roof was listed as new,
right?

79
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:30,528
It was.
Have you checked Maria's studio?

80
00:06:30,631 --> 00:06:32,495
No, I have not checked
Maria's studio yet.

81
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:34,566
Let me call you back.

82
00:06:40,261 --> 00:06:42,643
I'm gonna show you
how to make these two ends meet

83
00:06:42,747 --> 00:06:44,783
using an easy trick.

84
00:06:44,887 --> 00:06:47,993
But first, my husband has to do
his regular interruption.

85
00:06:48,097 --> 00:06:49,961
Sorry, everyone.
I'm just looking for leaks.

86
00:06:50,064 --> 00:06:52,619
- Forgot you were recording.
- It's okay.

87
00:06:52,722 --> 00:06:54,414
We've been dealing with a lot
of bad leaks

88
00:06:54,517 --> 00:06:55,794
from the storm last night.

89
00:06:55,898 --> 00:06:59,280
Uh, I think my studio
was spared.

90
00:06:59,764 --> 00:07:02,042
I thought you retired
Martha the Mannequin.

91
00:07:02,145 --> 00:07:04,458
Oh, I love Martha.

92
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:08,428
She's all I have left
of my first studio in New York.

93
00:07:08,531 --> 00:07:10,947
Sure, she's seen better days.

94
00:07:11,051 --> 00:07:13,605
She's about as well maintained
as our roof.

95
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:15,676
I get it. I get it.
You don't like Martha.

96
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,851
Now get out of here.

97
00:07:36,179 --> 00:07:38,112
Hello there.

98
00:07:38,216 --> 00:07:40,805
Hey.
Are you my neighbor?

99
00:07:40,908 --> 00:07:43,083
I am.

100
00:07:43,186 --> 00:07:47,605
I thought this house was gonna
sit on the market forever.

101
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,986
- My name's Larry.
- I'm Chuck.

102
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,126
I thought this place was
a ghost town.

103
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,335
Haven't really met anybody yet.

104
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:56,855
Been dealing with
some housewarming issues

105
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,305
since moving in.

106
00:07:58,408 --> 00:08:01,481
Yeah?
What kind?

107
00:08:01,584 --> 00:08:03,828
That rain we got last night.

108
00:08:03,931 --> 00:08:06,037
Roof leaked
in almost every room.

109
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,004
Yeah.

110
00:08:08,108 --> 00:08:10,351
That willhappen
in these old homes.

111
00:08:10,455 --> 00:08:12,526
Hopefully I'll have
some recourse

112
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,183
against your old neighbor.

113
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:16,599
Said the roof was new.

114
00:08:16,703 --> 00:08:19,119
Definitely not new.

115
00:08:19,222 --> 00:08:21,293
Oh.
Sorry to hear that.

116
00:08:21,397 --> 00:08:23,399
Pain in the ass.

117
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,540
But I doubt there's any recourse
to be had.

118
00:08:26,644 --> 00:08:28,231
Why is that?

119
00:08:28,335 --> 00:08:32,684
'Cause the previous owner
killed himself, Chuck.

120
00:08:33,651 --> 00:08:35,825
They didn't mention that?

121
00:08:39,726 --> 00:08:41,900
You were right about the roof.

122
00:08:42,004 --> 00:08:44,662
The seller listed it as replaced
three years ago.

123
00:08:44,765 --> 00:08:47,423
- You sent in all the pictures?
- Yeah.

124
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,770
I got up there.

125
00:08:49,874 --> 00:08:53,187
That roof is not new.

126
00:08:53,843 --> 00:08:56,881
Not sure how my inspector
could have missed that.

127
00:08:58,917 --> 00:09:02,265
But don't worry.
I'll figure it all out.

128
00:09:02,369 --> 00:09:03,922
- Thanks.
- And don't forget.

129
00:09:04,026 --> 00:09:06,407
Next week you owe me
a testimonial

130
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:09,790
saying how great
Bonnie Davis Realty is.

131
00:09:13,414 --> 00:09:16,314
Chuck? You there?

132
00:09:17,004 --> 00:09:20,180
Yeah. Yeah. Sounds good.
I'll call you tomorrow.

133
00:09:20,283 --> 00:09:22,423
Okay.
Bye, now.

134
00:09:55,042 --> 00:09:57,079
Hey. Hon?

135
00:10:00,427 --> 00:10:01,946
Maria.

136
00:10:03,568 --> 00:10:06,053
What time is it?

137
00:10:06,536 --> 00:10:09,332
It's early.
Just...Just look outside.

138
00:10:18,376 --> 00:10:19,826
My God.

139
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:26,522
It's not here!

140
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,905
How the hell did it get outside?
Did you put it out there?

141
00:10:30,008 --> 00:10:31,734
Do you think I would do that?

142
00:10:31,838 --> 00:10:35,462
No, but it didn't
walk out there on its own.

143
00:10:35,565 --> 00:10:37,429
What's going on?

144
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,132
What are you doing out here,
Martha?

145
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,185
Hey.
What's going on out here?

146
00:11:09,289 --> 00:11:11,705
Hey, Larry.

147
00:11:11,809 --> 00:11:14,950
I'm beginning to think it has
a mind of its own.

148
00:11:15,053 --> 00:11:17,746
You don't know
how this got out here?

149
00:11:18,332 --> 00:11:20,921
My best guess is that
my little sister is taking on

150
00:11:21,025 --> 00:11:23,717
a dark sense of humor.

151
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,169
How is she?

152
00:11:27,272 --> 00:11:28,722
Isabel.

153
00:11:28,826 --> 00:11:33,658
Her, uh, mental well-being,
I should say.

154
00:11:33,762 --> 00:11:36,730
Why are you asking me that?

155
00:11:37,351 --> 00:11:39,388
I know what happened
to your mother.

156
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:41,873
With the car accident?

157
00:11:41,977 --> 00:11:45,532
Maria sort of filled me in
on your story.

158
00:11:45,635 --> 00:11:47,707
I'm very sorry.

159
00:11:48,224 --> 00:11:55,473
This -- This town has had
a lot of...suicide.

160
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,927
People struggling
with depression seem...

161
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:04,171
the most vulnerable.

162
00:12:05,586 --> 00:12:07,140
To her.

163
00:12:08,797 --> 00:12:11,040
Sorry.
"Her"?

164
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:14,872
Keep an eye out on Isabel
is all I'm saying.

165
00:12:17,046 --> 00:12:19,221
She knows how to mess
with people.

166
00:12:21,361 --> 00:12:22,707
Isabel.

167
00:12:25,675 --> 00:12:27,885
Wait.
That's it?

168
00:12:27,988 --> 00:12:30,025
That's all you're gonna say?

169
00:12:30,128 --> 00:12:31,889
We have a wonderful library.

170
00:12:31,992 --> 00:12:34,823
You should read up
on the town's history a bit.

171
00:12:34,926 --> 00:12:37,480
Friends of Gardening
are welcome.

172
00:12:40,518 --> 00:12:42,140
Gardening?

173
00:13:48,586 --> 00:13:50,657
Don't...do it.

174
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:55,317
I'm sorry?

175
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:58,320
Don't...do it.

176
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,636
Are you okay?

177
00:14:06,604 --> 00:14:08,399
What's your name?

178
00:14:09,503 --> 00:14:11,367
Ashley.

179
00:14:11,471 --> 00:14:14,612
Can I call someone for you,
Ashley?

180
00:14:14,715 --> 00:14:17,408
No.

181
00:14:20,411 --> 00:14:21,999
Trust me.

182
00:14:22,102 --> 00:14:24,864
Just put the books back
and leave.

183
00:14:25,761 --> 00:14:29,040
Don't...do it.

184
00:14:29,765 --> 00:14:30,766
Listen.

185
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,147
It's real.

186
00:14:33,942 --> 00:14:36,323
It's -- It's all real.

187
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,292
Just don't look for it.

188
00:14:39,395 --> 00:14:43,434
Just...
Just get out of this town.

189
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:03,005
You looking for Forest Road?

190
00:15:03,109 --> 00:15:05,180
What's that?

191
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:09,115
People who, uh, take out
these old archival books

192
00:15:09,218 --> 00:15:11,565
are always thinking
they're gonna find Forest Road.

193
00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:13,567
It can't be found.

194
00:15:15,431 --> 00:15:17,917
Uh, I've --
I've never heard of it.

195
00:15:25,786 --> 00:15:27,409
Oh, by the way,

196
00:15:27,512 --> 00:15:31,654
there's a young girl back there
that seems really upset.

197
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,280
Also, I think somebody left
a stack of books

198
00:15:36,383 --> 00:15:39,559
in the middle of the aisle
in the arts section.

199
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:52,158
I'm on it.

200
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,265
Here you go.

201
00:15:58,888 --> 00:15:59,820
Thanks.

202
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,374
Olivia.

203
00:17:10,477 --> 00:17:12,928
- Hi, Mr. Wilson.
- Come on in.

204
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,999
You're my first student
at the new house.

205
00:17:15,103 --> 00:17:17,277
Uh, let me take your coat.

206
00:17:19,762 --> 00:17:21,730
Have a seat.

207
00:17:25,285 --> 00:17:27,253
What should I do?

208
00:17:27,356 --> 00:17:31,464
Let's start with some scales.
How about a C major?

209
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,064
So we're starting
with the basics, I see.

210
00:17:45,167 --> 00:17:49,102
Not to worry.
I teach all skill levels.

211
00:17:49,585 --> 00:17:52,140
- Can I get you some water?
- Water would be great.

212
00:17:52,243 --> 00:17:53,831
You got it.

213
00:17:56,247 --> 00:17:59,319
It's honestly refreshing
to teach someone like you

214
00:17:59,423 --> 00:18:02,081
instead of the kids in my class
who think they know everything

215
00:18:02,184 --> 00:18:04,600
there is about music already.

216
00:18:04,704 --> 00:18:06,533
So I think this will work out
well.

217
00:18:12,574 --> 00:18:15,059
So you do have some skills
after all.

218
00:18:16,992 --> 00:18:18,269
Why were you...

219
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:26,484
There...
There's a woman at the piano.

220
00:18:26,588 --> 00:18:29,246
A woman?

221
00:18:50,439 --> 00:18:53,684
I-I th-- I think I should go.

222
00:18:55,444 --> 00:18:56,514
Wait.

223
00:18:56,618 --> 00:18:59,138
Wait.
Olivia, what happened?

224
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,588
She just started playing.

225
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:05,696
I didn't see her face.

226
00:19:07,249 --> 00:19:10,873
I didn't want to see her face.

227
00:19:24,473 --> 00:19:26,648
...on the Internet.

228
00:19:26,751 --> 00:19:30,548
If any record existed, I'm sure
the town got rid of it long ago.

229
00:19:30,652 --> 00:19:33,379
Right.
But what happened in 1980?

230
00:19:33,482 --> 00:19:35,795
Hey.

231
00:19:35,898 --> 00:19:37,279
Chuck.

232
00:19:39,074 --> 00:19:40,282
You found us.

233
00:19:40,386 --> 00:19:42,284
Maria is out of town,

234
00:19:42,388 --> 00:19:46,046
so I thought I might check out
Friends of Gardening.

235
00:19:46,461 --> 00:19:49,015
You hiding your gardens
from the Gestapo?

236
00:19:49,118 --> 00:19:51,569
Subject matter
of these meetings...

237
00:19:51,673 --> 00:19:53,502
is something
a lot of the townspeople

238
00:19:53,606 --> 00:19:56,609
would rather
never get discussed.

239
00:19:58,024 --> 00:19:59,543
Have you seen her?

240
00:20:00,613 --> 00:20:02,339
Seen who?

241
00:20:03,616 --> 00:20:06,964
Come on.
Have a seat.

242
00:20:11,624 --> 00:20:14,558
Thanks to those of you
who made it out tonight.

243
00:20:16,318 --> 00:20:19,010
I see some more empty seats
this time.

244
00:20:19,114 --> 00:20:21,289
I get that.

245
00:20:21,392 --> 00:20:24,326
It's not easy to talk about.

246
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:28,848
I sometimes wish we had
an addiction of some kind.

247
00:20:28,951 --> 00:20:31,057
But we've got her.

248
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,336
You know why the other ones
are not showing up, right?

249
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,751
They're scared.

250
00:20:35,855 --> 00:20:38,202
I'm telling you.

251
00:20:38,306 --> 00:20:41,274
One youth suicide.
Everyone is hiding again.

252
00:20:41,378 --> 00:20:44,381
It's starting to feel like
1980 all over again.

253
00:20:44,484 --> 00:20:46,969
You weren't here in 1980.

254
00:20:47,073 --> 00:20:50,179
It's not that bad.
Yet.

255
00:20:50,283 --> 00:20:52,423
I don't know.

256
00:20:52,527 --> 00:20:54,736
The library books
started showing up again.

257
00:20:55,461 --> 00:20:57,980
Something's going on.

258
00:20:58,084 --> 00:20:59,913
We haven't had a suicide
in years.

259
00:21:00,017 --> 00:21:02,744
And now that young girl, Ashley.

260
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:08,232
It really does feel like
we're starting another bad wave.

261
00:21:08,336 --> 00:21:12,236
Let's not hit the panic button
yet, okay?

262
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,618
Anyway, Chuck here is new
to town.

263
00:21:16,378 --> 00:21:18,035
I'm sorry.

264
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:21,728
Hey, everyone.

265
00:21:21,832 --> 00:21:25,905
You must be wondering
what we do in these meetings.

266
00:21:26,457 --> 00:21:29,426
Everyone here has been affected
by her in some way.

267
00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:32,463
Lost a loved one to suicide
or...

268
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:35,639
just being terrorized by her
in some way.

269
00:21:35,742 --> 00:21:37,296
Could be through
a lost loved one

270
00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:40,368
or even a sentimental object.

271
00:21:40,816 --> 00:21:43,302
Sometimes through their dreams.

272
00:21:43,405 --> 00:21:47,029
The dreams are the worst.
They won't stop.

273
00:21:48,893 --> 00:21:53,346
I have my home on the market,
but truthfully, I'm...

274
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:56,867
thinking about just walking away
from the mortgage.

275
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,524
Screw it.

276
00:21:58,627 --> 00:22:00,422
From what I heard,
Ashley's parents

277
00:22:00,526 --> 00:22:02,424
put their place on the market
once it started for her.

278
00:22:02,528 --> 00:22:03,805
They should've just left.

279
00:22:03,908 --> 00:22:05,324
I mean, I don't care

280
00:22:05,427 --> 00:22:07,636
what kind of financial situation
you're in.

281
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,052
You have to go
if you're high risk.

282
00:22:10,156 --> 00:22:12,054
And she was clearly high risk.

283
00:22:12,158 --> 00:22:14,954
I honestly don't think
it would have mattered.

284
00:22:15,057 --> 00:22:17,750
It's like an infection.

285
00:22:17,853 --> 00:22:20,580
She stays with you
once she's in.

286
00:22:20,684 --> 00:22:23,480
I'm sorry, everyone.

287
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:25,620
I don't know much about this.

288
00:22:25,723 --> 00:22:28,174
Who are you talking about?

289
00:22:28,277 --> 00:22:31,384
You keep saying "her."

290
00:22:31,488 --> 00:22:33,593
I-I don't know who that is.

291
00:22:33,697 --> 00:22:36,941
Helen Foster.

292
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,566
Who's that?

293
00:22:40,876 --> 00:22:43,120
She's the one that's been
inflicting pain on this town

294
00:22:43,223 --> 00:22:44,949
for decades.

295
00:22:45,053 --> 00:22:48,815
It's the reason why we keep
these meetings secret.

296
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:52,923
The town discourages
active dialogue about Helen.

297
00:22:53,337 --> 00:22:56,064
They say it's because they don't
want to perpetuate myths, but --

298
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:57,893
Which is just bullshit.

299
00:22:57,997 --> 00:23:01,621
It's bullshit.
They know she exists.

300
00:23:01,725 --> 00:23:03,761
They're just scared.
They don't know how to stop it.

301
00:23:03,865 --> 00:23:06,074
It's because
it can't be stopped.

302
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:09,457
It canbe stopped
if we find Forest Road.

303
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,769
Forest Road.

304
00:23:11,873 --> 00:23:16,118
825 Forest Road.

305
00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:19,950
It's where Helen is said
to have lived in the '40s,

306
00:23:20,053 --> 00:23:22,262
when she killed herself.

307
00:23:22,366 --> 00:23:24,679
It's like no one knows
where it's at.

308
00:23:24,782 --> 00:23:27,371
- It doesn't exist.
- No. Wait.

309
00:23:27,475 --> 00:23:28,545
Listen.

310
00:23:28,648 --> 00:23:32,272
I'm sure it existed once, right?

311
00:23:32,376 --> 00:23:34,067
But it's gone now.

312
00:23:34,171 --> 00:23:37,381
It has to be.
It's why nobody can find it.

313
00:23:37,485 --> 00:23:39,866
And I know you've all tried.

314
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:42,593
Don't forget I...
I see what books you check out.

315
00:23:42,697 --> 00:23:44,630
No.
Nobody can find it

316
00:23:44,733 --> 00:23:46,597
because they're not looking
in the right place.

317
00:23:46,701 --> 00:23:48,772
How do you know
there's a right place to look?

318
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:50,498
I mean, there's not one bit
of evidence that proves

319
00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:52,292
the house can still be found.

320
00:23:52,396 --> 00:23:56,055
Hey. Every abandoned structure
in town's been checked.

321
00:23:56,158 --> 00:23:59,161
I don't know where to look.

322
00:23:59,265 --> 00:24:01,819
Then stop looking.
You ever thought about that?

323
00:24:01,923 --> 00:24:05,478
Finding that house is
the only way to get rid of her.

324
00:24:05,582 --> 00:24:08,308
Don't you get that?
Hmm?

325
00:24:11,588 --> 00:24:14,349
Destroy the house,
destroy Helen.

326
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,178
If that's where she died,

327
00:24:16,282 --> 00:24:19,492
that has to be where her power
over this town comes from.

328
00:24:19,872 --> 00:24:21,770
It's obvious it's outside
the town borders

329
00:24:21,874 --> 00:24:23,669
as they're drawn today.

330
00:24:23,772 --> 00:24:26,188
Has to be out there somewhere.

331
00:24:26,292 --> 00:24:28,639
I'm sorry, everyone,
but I think it's, uh,

332
00:24:28,743 --> 00:24:32,816
time to cut this meeting short,
get going.

333
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:35,301
Is it her?

334
00:24:35,404 --> 00:24:36,578
We're just being careful.

335
00:24:36,682 --> 00:24:39,236
Shit.
I'm out of here.

336
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:55,839
You know, sometimes
she ends our meetings abruptly.

337
00:24:55,942 --> 00:24:57,979
It's happened once or twice.

338
00:24:58,082 --> 00:25:01,223
You just have to keep an eye out
for the signs.

339
00:25:30,045 --> 00:25:32,531
Art?

340
00:25:32,634 --> 00:25:35,154
It's what she got
the scholarship for.

341
00:25:35,257 --> 00:25:39,503
Uh, so...what do you think?

342
00:25:39,607 --> 00:25:41,332
Well, I'm amazed at the price.

343
00:25:41,436 --> 00:25:44,301
I-I feel like we're gonna find
dead bodies in the basement.

344
00:25:46,096 --> 00:25:50,100
Mm. No mention of dead bodies
in the disclosure.

345
00:25:50,203 --> 00:25:52,067
Listen.

346
00:25:52,171 --> 00:25:55,795
This town just has really old
homes but with very good bones,

347
00:25:55,899 --> 00:25:58,626
which is what you want.

348
00:26:04,424 --> 00:26:07,186
Lease is up in the city
next month.

349
00:26:10,327 --> 00:26:12,743
I don't think we can wait.

350
00:26:14,193 --> 00:26:17,714
Yeah.
It's -- It's got good bones.

351
00:26:17,817 --> 00:26:21,545
So...should we put an offer in
today?

352
00:26:24,341 --> 00:26:27,275
Isabel, what do you think?

353
00:26:33,246 --> 00:26:35,524
I'm not sure moving
to this tiny town

354
00:26:35,628 --> 00:26:38,700
with Chuck and Maria
was a good idea.

355
00:26:39,149 --> 00:26:43,671
Chuck's in his own world,
teaching, giving piano lessons.

356
00:26:43,774 --> 00:26:45,673
Maria's super distracted
with the store opening

357
00:26:45,776 --> 00:26:47,916
and her live stream.

358
00:26:49,297 --> 00:26:51,955
The strangest thing is
that since I moved here,

359
00:26:52,058 --> 00:26:55,234
I've been having these dreams
about my mother.

360
00:26:56,649 --> 00:26:58,893
And every time,
it feels so real.

361
00:26:58,996 --> 00:27:00,722
I know what Dr. Lewis would say.

362
00:27:00,826 --> 00:27:02,517
I just miss her so much,

363
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,588
and it's causing me to feel
these things.

364
00:27:09,593 --> 00:27:12,734
Hey.
Sorry to interrupt.

365
00:27:12,838 --> 00:27:14,253
Who were you talking to?

366
00:27:14,356 --> 00:27:17,463
Oh, it's just something
Dr. Lewis suggested

367
00:27:17,566 --> 00:27:20,639
until I find someone
more local --

368
00:27:20,742 --> 00:27:28,163
keep a daily journal of my...
you know, thoughts and feelings.

369
00:27:28,267 --> 00:27:29,406
Stupid stuff.

370
00:27:40,728 --> 00:27:42,661
Um...

371
00:27:44,628 --> 00:27:47,148
...do you think therapy
is helping?

372
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:49,357
Yes, Chuck.

373
00:27:50,841 --> 00:27:53,257
What do you care?
It's not costing you anything.

374
00:27:53,361 --> 00:27:54,983
I'm your brother.

375
00:27:55,087 --> 00:27:57,434
I just want to make sure
it's actually helping you.

376
00:28:11,862 --> 00:28:16,418
Wow.
Izzy, these are good.

377
00:28:18,627 --> 00:28:20,837
When did you draw this?

378
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,529
Kind of looks like
our new house.

379
00:28:23,632 --> 00:28:25,531
I don't really remember.

380
00:28:25,634 --> 00:28:27,913
Two, three years ago, maybe.

381
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,885
What's this one?

382
00:28:35,852 --> 00:28:37,992
Is that you?

383
00:28:40,788 --> 00:28:42,859
Whose hand is that?

384
00:28:44,757 --> 00:28:46,794
Mom's?

385
00:28:46,897 --> 00:28:49,451
I can't remember
why I drew that.

386
00:28:50,038 --> 00:28:53,559
Just remember I drew it
right after you left us.

387
00:28:53,662 --> 00:28:57,218
I didn't leave you.
I...

388
00:29:13,372 --> 00:29:18,618
Maybe you can help unpack some
of the kitchen stuff tomorrow.

389
00:29:18,722 --> 00:29:21,863
Take your mind off things.

390
00:29:24,417 --> 00:29:27,282
Just stack it all up
like Mom did?

391
00:29:27,386 --> 00:29:29,491
Remember that?

392
00:29:29,595 --> 00:29:32,874
Stacking all the bowls
and dishes in a pyramid

393
00:29:32,978 --> 00:29:34,634
and leaving a note that said...

394
00:29:34,738 --> 00:29:36,636
They won't put themselves away.

395
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:40,123
Yeah.

396
00:29:45,611 --> 00:29:46,508
Get some sleep.

397
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,792
Mom?

398
00:30:08,703 --> 00:30:10,601
Maria.

399
00:30:12,465 --> 00:30:14,467
What time is it?

400
00:30:14,882 --> 00:30:18,161
It's early.
Just...Just look outside.

401
00:30:21,509 --> 00:30:23,925
It's not here!

402
00:30:24,029 --> 00:30:27,101
How the hell did it get outside?
Did you put it out there?

403
00:30:27,204 --> 00:30:28,965
Do you think I would do that?

404
00:30:29,068 --> 00:30:33,210
No, but it didn't
walk out there on its own.

405
00:30:33,314 --> 00:30:35,937
What's going on?

406
00:30:36,524 --> 00:30:39,872
- My dressing mannequin.
- What about it?

407
00:30:39,976 --> 00:30:42,185
It's outside in the yard.

408
00:30:42,288 --> 00:30:45,222
The yard?
How'd it get there?

409
00:30:45,326 --> 00:30:48,674
Damn it, Isabel.
Somebody put it out there.

410
00:30:48,777 --> 00:30:50,503
You don't think it was me,
do you?

411
00:30:50,607 --> 00:30:51,953
I don't know.

412
00:30:52,057 --> 00:30:53,990
I'm not worried
about my mannequin.

413
00:30:54,093 --> 00:30:56,993
But that dress could have been
ruined if it had rained.

414
00:31:09,522 --> 00:31:11,317
Sorry.
"Her"?

415
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:15,908
Keep an eye out on Isabel
is all I'm saying.

416
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:21,086
She knows how to mess
with people.

417
00:31:23,605 --> 00:31:25,159
Isabel.

418
00:31:26,643 --> 00:31:29,715
Wait.
That's it?

419
00:31:29,818 --> 00:31:31,890
That's all you're gonna say?

420
00:31:34,582 --> 00:31:37,792
You should read up
on the town's history a bit.

421
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,001
We have a wonderful library.

422
00:31:41,071 --> 00:31:43,694
Friends of Gardening
are welcome.

423
00:31:46,111 --> 00:31:50,046
What the hell were you thinking?

424
00:31:50,149 --> 00:31:52,634
You really think I'd do that
to Maria?

425
00:31:53,842 --> 00:31:55,465
Chuck.

426
00:31:59,676 --> 00:32:01,643
It wasn't me.

427
00:33:14,268 --> 00:33:16,339
Where'd you go?

428
00:33:20,067 --> 00:33:21,551
Maria's out of town,

429
00:33:21,654 --> 00:33:24,312
and you haven't answered
your phone all night.

430
00:33:59,968 --> 00:34:02,074
Where'd you go, Chuck?

431
00:34:02,178 --> 00:34:04,180
Just out.

432
00:34:05,802 --> 00:34:07,390
Larry and I went for a drink

433
00:34:07,493 --> 00:34:11,704
after their, uh,
gardening meeting.

434
00:34:11,808 --> 00:34:13,741
Why?
Is, uh, something wrong?

435
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:15,122
I don't know.

436
00:34:15,225 --> 00:34:19,574
It's...just been weird
around here.

437
00:34:19,678 --> 00:34:22,681
I can't explain it.

438
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:26,167
And there's this girl
at my school.

439
00:34:26,271 --> 00:34:29,515
Uh, her name's Ashley.

440
00:34:31,414 --> 00:34:34,727
Last night, she killed herself.

441
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:42,666
Are you okay?

442
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,255
Uh...

443
00:34:50,157 --> 00:34:52,952
...I don't think so.

444
00:34:53,401 --> 00:34:56,370
Some things are happening
that...

445
00:34:56,473 --> 00:35:00,926
I really can't tell
if they're just in my head

446
00:35:01,029 --> 00:35:03,860
or if they're real.

447
00:35:06,414 --> 00:35:08,623
I have a friend from school.

448
00:35:08,727 --> 00:35:10,487
His name's Luke.

449
00:35:12,317 --> 00:35:16,804
He said something
about this town having an...

450
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:19,738
effect on people.

451
00:35:19,841 --> 00:35:21,740
Have you heard that?

452
00:35:23,673 --> 00:35:25,675
No.

453
00:35:26,883 --> 00:35:29,161
Have you ever...

454
00:35:29,265 --> 00:35:32,302
ever had suicidal thoughts
yourself?

455
00:35:39,275 --> 00:35:40,724
My heart...

456
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,247
My heart hurts every day.

457
00:35:46,351 --> 00:35:50,872
Like...physical pain.

458
00:35:52,598 --> 00:35:54,876
I hate this feeling.

459
00:35:57,362 --> 00:36:00,572
Has your therapist
prescribed you anything?

460
00:36:00,675 --> 00:36:04,334
I'm sure there's a pill
out there that can help you.

461
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:08,027
I don't understand why you
think I'd want to be medicated.

462
00:36:15,034 --> 00:36:16,346
Okay.

463
00:36:17,071 --> 00:36:18,348
No pills?

464
00:36:21,524 --> 00:36:25,079
Then stick with the therapy.

465
00:36:25,631 --> 00:36:30,567
But stop blaming yourself
for what happened to Mom.

466
00:36:30,947 --> 00:36:33,708
That is a hole
you do not want to go down.

467
00:36:34,916 --> 00:36:37,781
Mom would never blame you.

468
00:36:37,885 --> 00:36:40,888
Hell, even the police said
it was nobody's fault.

469
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:43,339
It was a car accident.

470
00:36:43,442 --> 00:36:46,411
A random tragedy.
Happens all the time.

471
00:36:46,514 --> 00:36:49,241
And the shitty thing is that
this time it happened to us.

472
00:36:49,345 --> 00:36:51,795
It didn't happen to us.
It happened to me.

473
00:36:53,866 --> 00:36:55,730
I lost her, too.

474
00:36:59,182 --> 00:37:01,943
You lost her a long time ago.

475
00:37:04,808 --> 00:37:09,019
I realize I didn't do
a good job keeping in touch

476
00:37:09,123 --> 00:37:11,229
- when I left --
- "A good job."

477
00:37:13,334 --> 00:37:16,786
Your wife didn't even know
you had a sister.

478
00:37:58,724 --> 00:38:00,761
Hi.

479
00:38:00,864 --> 00:38:03,522
Um, is Isabel home?

480
00:38:04,385 --> 00:38:05,593
I'm here.

481
00:38:08,216 --> 00:38:10,080
It's nice to meet you,
Mr. Wilson.

482
00:38:10,184 --> 00:38:11,565
This is my brother, Chuck.

483
00:38:11,668 --> 00:38:13,705
Chuck, this is Luke from school.

484
00:38:13,808 --> 00:38:16,673
Oh. Okay.
It-- It's nice to meet you.

485
00:38:16,777 --> 00:38:18,537
Uh, I'm starting there
next semester.

486
00:38:18,641 --> 00:38:20,367
Right.
Music history.

487
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:22,334
You signing up?

488
00:38:22,438 --> 00:38:24,647
Um, maybe.

489
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,959
Let's go.
We'll be upstairs.

490
00:38:27,063 --> 00:38:28,651
Oh.
Uh, okay.

491
00:38:28,754 --> 00:38:32,655
Just...Just leave the door...

492
00:38:43,459 --> 00:38:45,840
Sorry.
Let me clear some things.

493
00:38:45,944 --> 00:38:47,048
You made these?

494
00:38:48,015 --> 00:38:49,430
Yeah.

495
00:38:51,052 --> 00:38:54,366
So, you never answered
my question the other day.

496
00:38:55,471 --> 00:38:57,956
What question?

497
00:38:58,059 --> 00:39:00,338
Have you seen something?

498
00:39:00,441 --> 00:39:02,754
Is there something to see?

499
00:39:02,857 --> 00:39:05,619
In this town?

500
00:39:05,722 --> 00:39:06,861
Yeah.

501
00:39:08,276 --> 00:39:10,348
And people who start
to ask questions

502
00:39:10,451 --> 00:39:13,040
usually have seen something.

503
00:39:15,283 --> 00:39:17,596
Chuck went to some meeting.

504
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,702
Gardening people?

505
00:39:19,805 --> 00:39:22,360
Friends of Gardening.
Yeah.

506
00:39:22,463 --> 00:39:24,362
Uh, they try to fly
under the radar

507
00:39:24,465 --> 00:39:26,122
so they can talk about it
openly.

508
00:39:26,225 --> 00:39:29,021
But everybody knows they're
not talking about gardening.

509
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:31,576
What are they talking about?

510
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:35,649
This town has been rumored
to be haunted forever.

511
00:39:35,752 --> 00:39:38,030
Did I tell you about
the library thing?

512
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:40,550
Okay.

513
00:39:40,654 --> 00:39:43,933
Well, some guy hung himself
years ago in the library.

514
00:39:44,036 --> 00:39:47,108
He used a stack of books
to climb up on a rope.

515
00:39:47,212 --> 00:39:49,628
The creepy part
is that the same stack of books

516
00:39:49,732 --> 00:39:53,114
have been seen by people walking
in that aisle since then.

517
00:39:53,218 --> 00:39:54,737
They got rid of those books,

518
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,567
and still they would turn up
stacked in that aisle.

519
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,505
Hey.
Uh, I'm sorry to interrupt.

520
00:40:04,609 --> 00:40:07,059
Uh, were you just in my studio?

521
00:40:07,163 --> 00:40:10,269
No.
Why?

522
00:40:10,753 --> 00:40:14,273
Um, nothing.
It's -- It's nothing.

523
00:40:14,377 --> 00:40:17,207
Um, I'm -- I'm sorry to bother.
It's nice to meet you.

524
00:40:20,176 --> 00:40:21,660
Your sister?

525
00:40:21,764 --> 00:40:23,075
In-law.

526
00:40:24,491 --> 00:40:26,631
- So what's behind it all?
- Right.

527
00:40:26,734 --> 00:40:30,013
So, it's all tied to a woman
who lived here

528
00:40:30,117 --> 00:40:33,638
like a half-century ago --
Helen Foster.

529
00:40:33,741 --> 00:40:37,538
Her daughter was bullied
at the school -- like, bad.

530
00:40:37,642 --> 00:40:40,679
Really bad.
And nobody did a thing about it.

531
00:40:40,783 --> 00:40:42,647
Helen wrote the school.

532
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:45,304
She even wrote the family
of the bully dozens of letters,

533
00:40:45,408 --> 00:40:47,790
and still it never stopped.

534
00:40:47,893 --> 00:40:50,586
Her daughter committed suicide.

535
00:40:51,518 --> 00:40:53,036
Helen went down a spiral.

536
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:56,039
She lost her job,
was about to lose her house

537
00:40:56,143 --> 00:40:59,629
when she killed the parents
of the bully andthe bully, too.

538
00:40:59,733 --> 00:41:01,976
And then she killed herself.

539
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:05,014
Put a shotgun in her mouth.
Boom.

540
00:41:07,534 --> 00:41:09,363
What house was hers?

541
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,676
Nobody knows.

542
00:41:11,779 --> 00:41:17,647
Just an address --
825 Forest Road,

543
00:41:17,751 --> 00:41:20,857
which doesn't exist
on any current map.

544
00:41:20,961 --> 00:41:23,101
Has anyone ever tried to find
the house?

545
00:41:23,204 --> 00:41:25,344
Oh, yeah.

546
00:41:25,448 --> 00:41:27,795
But the only existing maps
from the time

547
00:41:27,899 --> 00:41:31,247
have been under a court-ordered
seal since the '50s.

548
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:34,422
A while back, the town council
was supposed to vote

549
00:41:34,526 --> 00:41:36,286
on unsealing the documents --

550
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:37,909
You know, throw open everything

551
00:41:38,012 --> 00:41:39,773
on the location
of Helen's home --

552
00:41:39,876 --> 00:41:42,292
but they never got the chance.

553
00:41:42,396 --> 00:41:45,088
The 1980 town council meeting.

554
00:41:45,192 --> 00:41:47,608
Yep.

555
00:41:47,712 --> 00:41:49,955
Nobody really knows
what happened that day.

556
00:41:50,059 --> 00:41:53,062
Uh, when the meeting
was supposed to start,

557
00:41:53,165 --> 00:41:54,753
the room was locked.

558
00:41:54,857 --> 00:41:57,515
People could see
the town-council members

559
00:41:57,618 --> 00:42:01,622
and just one lone woman
in the audience.

560
00:42:01,726 --> 00:42:05,108
Helen Foster.

561
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:19,675
I don't think this is working
the way I hoped it would.

562
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:24,403
It's the dreams.

563
00:42:24,507 --> 00:42:26,751
I've never experienced anything
like this in my life

564
00:42:26,854 --> 00:42:29,236
until I moved here.

565
00:42:32,032 --> 00:42:34,517
They're so real.

566
00:42:37,451 --> 00:42:39,522
They usually involve my mother.

567
00:42:43,871 --> 00:42:46,736
I had a dream I went downstairs

568
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:51,638
and she was in the kitchen,
just standing there.

569
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,193
I called out to her.

570
00:42:55,296 --> 00:42:56,884
She wouldn't answer me.

571
00:42:56,988 --> 00:43:00,060
She would just...stare.

572
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:10,070
Then she just...
started screaming.

573
00:43:13,694 --> 00:43:18,181
It was this...
bloodcurdling scream.

574
00:43:23,117 --> 00:43:25,948
I'd only heard that scream once.

575
00:43:30,573 --> 00:43:32,575
It was right before she died.

576
00:43:36,924 --> 00:43:39,064
Thanks for inviting me out
tonight.

577
00:43:39,168 --> 00:43:41,204
I didn't want to go
to this place alone.

578
00:43:41,308 --> 00:43:44,414
No. It -- It could be fun.
You want to check it out?

579
00:43:57,151 --> 00:43:59,947
Anything here catch your eye?

580
00:44:00,051 --> 00:44:02,985
So much good stuff here.

581
00:44:03,468 --> 00:44:07,368
I love when a painting
has something hidden within it,

582
00:44:07,472 --> 00:44:09,060
something you might never notice

583
00:44:09,163 --> 00:44:11,476
unless you stare at it
for hours.

584
00:44:13,961 --> 00:44:14,997
What?

585
00:44:17,137 --> 00:44:19,104
I don't know.
Maybe it's just, um...

586
00:44:19,208 --> 00:44:22,073
It's exactly what Chuck says
about music.

587
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:25,593
There's something locked inside
that you won't find

588
00:44:25,697 --> 00:44:27,872
unless you hear it over
and over.

589
00:44:30,115 --> 00:44:32,946
Um, you want something
to drink?

590
00:44:33,049 --> 00:44:34,361
Sure.

591
00:44:40,436 --> 00:44:42,507
Sparkling water if you have it.

592
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:44,578
- Two.
- You got it.

593
00:44:45,821 --> 00:44:47,685
Thank you.

594
00:44:59,662 --> 00:45:02,492
Was this whole night
Chuck's idea?

595
00:45:02,596 --> 00:45:05,910
No.
It was mine, actually.

596
00:45:06,773 --> 00:45:09,327
Thanks.

597
00:45:11,225 --> 00:45:13,883
You know,
I thought you didn't like me.

598
00:45:14,781 --> 00:45:17,059
Why would you think that?

599
00:45:18,405 --> 00:45:19,993
Come on.

600
00:45:20,096 --> 00:45:22,547
You guys were fine
with your life in the city,

601
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:24,998
your apartment.

602
00:45:25,101 --> 00:45:28,001
And here I come out of the blue
to mess everything up

603
00:45:28,104 --> 00:45:31,073
and send you running
for the 'burbs.

604
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,766
Um...

605
00:45:36,354 --> 00:45:38,218
Listen.
Um...

606
00:45:39,909 --> 00:45:41,877
So, I have a sister.

607
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:44,293
She lives on the other side
of the country,

608
00:45:44,396 --> 00:45:49,229
and the only time I ever see her
is on my sewing vlog.

609
00:45:49,332 --> 00:45:50,782
You know, she sees me.

610
00:45:50,886 --> 00:45:54,682
Um, but we are distant.

611
00:45:54,993 --> 00:45:57,824
She just...
She never understood

612
00:45:57,927 --> 00:46:00,585
the stuff that I went through
when I was younger.

613
00:46:00,688 --> 00:46:02,276
What do you mean?

614
00:46:03,312 --> 00:46:05,279
Um...

615
00:46:07,799 --> 00:46:11,734
Well, I have, um,
bipolar disorder.

616
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:13,149
I have medication.

617
00:46:13,253 --> 00:46:15,945
It keeps it mostly in check
for me.

618
00:46:16,049 --> 00:46:18,016
I didn't know that.

619
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,638
Yeah.

620
00:46:19,742 --> 00:46:24,126
It's not something Chuck
and I even talk about...ever.

621
00:46:24,229 --> 00:46:29,994
Um, I've had two episodes
since we've known each other.

622
00:46:31,961 --> 00:46:34,170
One time he found me
in the middle of the night,

623
00:46:34,274 --> 00:46:40,659
um...just swollen eyes
and bloody nose.

624
00:46:41,108 --> 00:46:43,593
I was just standing
in the hallway of our building

625
00:46:43,697 --> 00:46:46,113
like I had no idea where I was.

626
00:46:47,011 --> 00:46:48,736
Were you okay?

627
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,669
Eventually, yeah.

628
00:46:50,773 --> 00:46:55,122
And -- And don't get me wrong.
Chuck, he's very supportive.

629
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:59,575
But he just doesn't get it.

630
00:46:59,678 --> 00:47:01,749
He just doesn't get anything

631
00:47:01,853 --> 00:47:04,822
that he can't physically fix
himself.

632
00:47:04,925 --> 00:47:06,444
Um...

633
00:47:06,547 --> 00:47:12,450
what I'm trying to say is,
um, just I get it...

634
00:47:12,553 --> 00:47:14,279
what you're going through.

635
00:47:27,016 --> 00:47:31,124
God.
Come on. Let's go.

636
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:39,166
Attention, everyone.
The gallery is closing.

637
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:41,789
Please leave
in an orderly fashion.

638
00:47:44,931 --> 00:47:46,933
Hey.
Uh, let's go.

639
00:50:51,082 --> 00:50:54,879
It's getting worse every night.

640
00:50:54,982 --> 00:50:57,226
I think I need to leave.

641
00:50:57,330 --> 00:51:01,299
Okay. So a move to campus
would be great, right?

642
00:51:03,163 --> 00:51:04,406
What?

643
00:51:04,509 --> 00:51:06,201
It's Chuck.

644
00:51:06,304 --> 00:51:09,031
He moved out when I was young,
and I hated him for it.

645
00:51:09,135 --> 00:51:11,413
Now I feel like I'd be doing
the same thing,

646
00:51:11,516 --> 00:51:14,485
just when we finally had
the chance to be a family again.

647
00:51:14,588 --> 00:51:17,488
Okay.
So what do you want to do?

648
00:51:17,591 --> 00:51:20,767
Honestly?
I want to find Forest Road.

649
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:23,632
You're not the first.

650
00:51:23,735 --> 00:51:25,599
Chuck has stacks of books
from the library,

651
00:51:25,703 --> 00:51:28,430
- looking for any kind of clue.
- That's already been tried.

652
00:51:28,533 --> 00:51:30,432
- Maybe you can help.
- No.

653
00:51:30,535 --> 00:51:31,881
- No?
- No.

654
00:51:31,985 --> 00:51:33,676
I'm not getting involved
in that.

655
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:36,472
- Why not?
- Look.

656
00:51:36,576 --> 00:51:38,785
Some people think Ashley
and her friend

657
00:51:38,888 --> 00:51:40,994
were looking for
Forest Road, too.

658
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,375
So?

659
00:51:42,478 --> 00:51:45,274
And they might have found it.

660
00:51:45,378 --> 00:51:47,518
One of her friends told me
that...

661
00:51:47,621 --> 00:51:49,658
...strange things
started happening to her

662
00:51:49,761 --> 00:51:51,591
before she took her life.

663
00:51:51,694 --> 00:51:54,249
It might be because she found
Forest Road.

664
00:51:54,352 --> 00:51:56,389
Is that true?

665
00:51:56,492 --> 00:51:59,668
I don't know!
Nobody knows. That's the point.

666
00:51:59,771 --> 00:52:01,704
I'm not taking that risk.

667
00:52:01,808 --> 00:52:04,604
I don't walk under ladders,
I won't open umbrellas indoors,

668
00:52:04,707 --> 00:52:06,157
and I won't look for
Forest Road.

669
00:52:06,261 --> 00:52:07,848
No way.

670
00:52:07,952 --> 00:52:09,574
Maybe you could just find out
how Ashley did it.

671
00:52:09,678 --> 00:52:11,921
- Like what she was up to.
- You're not listening.

672
00:52:14,061 --> 00:52:15,546
Chuck.
What's up?

673
00:52:15,649 --> 00:52:17,410
Hey, can you make it back
to the house?

674
00:52:17,513 --> 00:52:20,275
Yeah, I can be there.
Is everything okay?

675
00:52:20,378 --> 00:52:21,724
There's nothing to worry about.

676
00:52:21,828 --> 00:52:23,416
I just need someone
to stay with Maria.

677
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:25,003
- And she's okay?
- She's fine.

678
00:52:25,107 --> 00:52:27,109
Just had a little scare.
Can you make it?

679
00:52:27,213 --> 00:52:29,215
Yeah.
I'm just 10 minutes away.

680
00:52:29,318 --> 00:52:31,286
I'll come home now.

681
00:52:31,389 --> 00:52:33,391
- What's up?
- I have to go.

682
00:52:33,495 --> 00:52:35,221
I'll call you later.

683
00:52:47,647 --> 00:52:49,649
What's going on?

684
00:52:51,961 --> 00:52:53,860
Are you okay, Maria?

685
00:52:53,963 --> 00:52:55,517
Everything's fine.

686
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:58,140
You start packing.
I'll be back in a little while.

687
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:02,903
Looking for Helen Foster's
home?

688
00:53:05,389 --> 00:53:07,839
Who is Helen Foster?

689
00:53:20,542 --> 00:53:21,819
Hey.

690
00:53:21,922 --> 00:53:24,718
Can I come in?

691
00:53:24,822 --> 00:53:25,788
Yep.

692
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,864
You leaving?

693
00:53:32,968 --> 00:53:34,245
Yep.

694
00:53:34,349 --> 00:53:38,249
Tomorrow.
Moving to campus.

695
00:53:38,353 --> 00:53:40,769
Chuck wants me out
after what happened to Maria.

696
00:53:42,391 --> 00:53:43,910
Just like that.

697
00:53:44,013 --> 00:53:46,361
Out of his life again.

698
00:53:48,017 --> 00:53:49,743
How's she doing?

699
00:53:49,847 --> 00:53:51,883
Not good.

700
00:53:51,987 --> 00:53:54,645
Probably gonna leave
in a couple days, too.

701
00:53:56,129 --> 00:53:58,027
Where will they go?

702
00:53:58,131 --> 00:53:59,477
I don't know.

703
00:53:59,581 --> 00:54:02,135
Chuck's just stalling.

704
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,793
He thinks he can find it.

705
00:54:05,276 --> 00:54:08,693
Well, that's what I wanted to
talk about.

706
00:54:08,797 --> 00:54:09,729
Yeah?

707
00:54:11,006 --> 00:54:12,663
Yeah.

708
00:54:15,182 --> 00:54:18,738
Oh.
I...I met your mom.

709
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:22,742
She looks a little different
here.

710
00:54:23,846 --> 00:54:25,054
Nice woman.

711
00:54:33,546 --> 00:54:35,513
What did you just say?

712
00:54:37,308 --> 00:54:41,036
Your mom?
This is her, right?

713
00:54:41,139 --> 00:54:43,072
She let me in.

714
00:54:44,039 --> 00:54:45,178
That's not funny.

715
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:47,560
What's not funny?

716
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:54,429
My mom's dead, Luke.

717
00:54:54,532 --> 00:54:58,605
She died in a car crash
a few months ago.

718
00:55:00,435 --> 00:55:02,782
You mean you saw Maria?

719
00:55:02,885 --> 00:55:04,818
I, uh...

720
00:55:04,922 --> 00:55:06,889
W-Who is this?

721
00:55:08,063 --> 00:55:10,479
That's my mother.

722
00:55:10,583 --> 00:55:12,550
That's not who you saw.

723
00:55:13,379 --> 00:55:15,933
Are you fucking with me?

724
00:55:18,245 --> 00:55:19,764
Luke...

725
00:55:22,491 --> 00:55:25,114
...what did you see?

726
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:29,256
Well, w-when I knocked
on the door, a-a woman answered.

727
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,982
She said she was your mother.

728
00:55:31,086 --> 00:55:33,606
I-I said, "Nice to meet you."

729
00:55:33,709 --> 00:55:35,332
She said you were up
in your room and --

730
00:55:35,435 --> 00:55:39,232
and she'd be up
to check on you later.

731
00:56:15,613 --> 00:56:18,236
Hey. Uh, I'm sorry.
I...

732
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:20,756
Maybe I was wrong.

733
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:23,690
Maybe...I was wrong.
I-I have to go.

734
00:56:28,695 --> 00:56:31,215
Isabel.

735
00:56:36,358 --> 00:56:38,498
Maria?

736
00:56:38,602 --> 00:56:41,432
Isabel...it's Mommy.

737
00:57:10,565 --> 00:57:14,223
These dishes
won't put themselves away.

738
00:57:24,613 --> 00:57:27,236
Where are you, honey?

739
00:57:38,627 --> 00:57:42,044
Don't you want to see
what you did to me?

740
00:57:56,714 --> 00:58:01,201
Isabel!

741
00:58:07,138 --> 00:58:08,277
Where are you going?!

742
00:58:35,684 --> 00:58:38,756
And this place has
tons of space for your art.

743
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:41,414
You still do that, right?

744
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:42,933
Art?

745
00:58:43,036 --> 00:58:45,901
It's what she got
the scholarship for.

746
00:58:48,386 --> 00:58:52,321
Uh, so...what do you think?

747
00:58:52,425 --> 00:58:54,461
Well, I'm amazed at the price.

748
00:58:54,565 --> 00:58:57,188
I-I feel like we're gonna find
dead bodies in the basement.

749
00:58:59,087 --> 00:59:01,227
Mm. No mention of dead bodies
in the disclosure.

750
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:03,160
Listen.

751
00:59:03,263 --> 00:59:07,440
This town just has really old
homes but with very good bones,

752
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:09,718
which is what you want.

753
00:59:09,822 --> 00:59:12,410
Lease is up in the city
next month.

754
00:59:12,514 --> 00:59:14,585
I don't think we can wait.

755
00:59:16,691 --> 00:59:19,832
Yeah.
It's -- It's got good bones.

756
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:23,905
So...should we put an offer in
today?

757
00:59:31,982 --> 00:59:34,260
Yeah. I'll be in the city
tomorrow morning.

758
00:59:34,363 --> 00:59:36,296
- We can talk about it then.
- Yeah. No problem.

759
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,782
But you'll have the floral
pattern samples for them?

760
00:59:38,885 --> 00:59:40,715
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Great.

761
00:59:40,818 --> 00:59:42,406
We'll see you when you get
to the city.

762
00:59:42,509 --> 00:59:44,028
- Okay. I got to go.
- Safe drive.

763
00:59:44,132 --> 00:59:45,651
Bye.

764
00:59:51,139 --> 00:59:53,590
Any particular reason
you're all of a sudden

765
00:59:53,693 --> 00:59:56,282
so interested
in Ashland Falls history?

766
00:59:56,385 --> 00:59:59,250
It'll sound stupid
if I say it out loud.

767
00:59:59,354 --> 01:00:02,564
When have you ever filtered
yourself for sounding stupid?

768
01:00:04,048 --> 01:00:05,498
Oh.
Uh, want to get some pizza?

769
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:07,845
Sure.
Let Isabel know.

770
01:00:07,949 --> 01:00:09,295
Right.

771
01:00:16,095 --> 01:00:19,270
Hey.
How do you feel about pizza?

772
01:00:20,375 --> 01:00:21,687
Okay.

773
01:00:27,106 --> 01:00:29,004
What?

774
01:00:29,108 --> 01:00:33,112
She just said, "Okay,"
and hung up.

775
01:00:35,045 --> 01:00:38,048
First few months of therapy
are gonna be rough.

776
01:00:38,151 --> 01:00:40,153
They were for me
when I was her age.

777
01:00:40,257 --> 01:00:42,362
What happened to you
was different.

778
01:00:42,466 --> 01:00:44,951
How so?

779
01:00:45,055 --> 01:00:48,852
Yours was an illness,
easily corrected by medicine.

780
01:00:48,955 --> 01:00:52,303
There's nothing easy about it.
You know that.

781
01:00:54,409 --> 01:00:56,169
I just think that therapy is --

782
01:00:56,273 --> 01:00:58,827
A scam. Yes.
I know how you feel.

783
01:00:58,931 --> 01:01:02,313
That is your opinion,
so keep it to yourself.

784
01:01:06,732 --> 01:01:09,700
She was the one driving.

785
01:01:10,218 --> 01:01:13,704
You have to understand the
impact that must have on her.

786
01:01:27,822 --> 01:01:31,757
This place is definitely
different than the city.

787
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:34,104
But I'm fine.

788
01:01:34,207 --> 01:01:36,727
I know that tone, Maria.
You're not fine.

789
01:01:36,831 --> 01:01:38,280
You're a city girl.

790
01:01:38,384 --> 01:01:40,455
Life in the country
isn't your style --

791
01:01:40,558 --> 01:01:41,939
especially with a teenager.

792
01:01:42,043 --> 01:01:43,665
How's that going
with the sister?

793
01:01:43,769 --> 01:01:46,288
I don't know, Allie.

794
01:01:46,392 --> 01:01:49,360
I just -- I mean, of course I'm
happy that we could help her.

795
01:01:49,464 --> 01:01:51,155
I just...

796
01:01:51,259 --> 01:01:53,157
I don't know if I can last
out here.

797
01:01:53,261 --> 01:01:56,195
That's what I mean.
Chuck is asking you for a lot.

798
01:01:56,298 --> 01:01:58,162
Yeah.

799
01:01:58,266 --> 01:02:02,304
I mean, we'll just wait and see
how Chuck likes the school.

800
01:02:02,408 --> 01:02:04,824
If he loves it,
we might be stuck here.

801
01:02:04,928 --> 01:02:07,585
- Well, better get going.
- Yeah. Okay.

802
01:02:07,689 --> 01:02:10,036
- Um, tell Mom I said hi.
- Will do.

803
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:12,073
- Love you.
- Love you.

804
01:02:47,936 --> 01:02:49,524
Allie says hi.

805
01:02:49,627 --> 01:02:52,320
Tell her hi back.

806
01:02:52,423 --> 01:02:54,149
Anything interesting?

807
01:02:54,253 --> 01:02:57,463
- Strange, actually.
- Mm? Like what?

808
01:02:57,912 --> 01:03:00,466
Well, it's all normal
town-history stuff.

809
01:03:00,569 --> 01:03:02,813
Stuff started as a coal town,
blah, blah, blah.

810
01:03:02,917 --> 01:03:07,335
But then, in 1953,

811
01:03:07,438 --> 01:03:10,407
the town randomly changed
all street names

812
01:03:10,510 --> 01:03:12,202
and redrew its borders.

813
01:03:12,305 --> 01:03:14,860
- Why would they do that?
- I don't know.

814
01:03:14,963 --> 01:03:17,034
Oh.
And, uh, get this.

815
01:03:17,138 --> 01:03:21,590
This house used to be...

816
01:03:21,694 --> 01:03:24,490
15 Rose Lane.

817
01:03:24,593 --> 01:03:27,804
Rose Lane. I love that.
Can we switch it back?

818
01:03:27,907 --> 01:03:30,772
Put a rose on the mailbox
or something.

819
01:03:30,876 --> 01:03:33,085
Did you find any --

820
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:37,054
Did I find any what?

821
01:03:44,924 --> 01:03:47,754
"They won't put themselves
away."

822
01:03:55,693 --> 01:03:58,351
What are you doing?

823
01:03:58,455 --> 01:04:01,251
Cleaning up the dish exhibit
here.

824
01:04:01,768 --> 01:04:03,563
Hey.

825
01:04:03,667 --> 01:04:06,497
Uh, could you tell Isabel to put
things away in the kitchen?

826
01:04:06,601 --> 01:04:08,465
It's not a college dorm room.

827
01:04:08,983 --> 01:04:10,708
Uh, okay.

828
01:04:10,812 --> 01:04:13,608
I'm off.
Wish me luck.

829
01:04:13,711 --> 01:04:15,852
You have to leave already?

830
01:04:15,955 --> 01:04:20,028
Uh-huh. I still have a business
I need to get back to sometimes.

831
01:04:20,132 --> 01:04:23,583
Just keep your phone on
and be safe.

832
01:04:23,687 --> 01:04:26,069
I'll see you tomorrow.
Love you.

833
01:04:26,172 --> 01:04:28,140
Love you.

834
01:04:37,597 --> 01:04:40,290
Family and friends and an
entire school are in grief today

835
01:04:40,393 --> 01:04:42,706
about the tragic death
of Ashley Stork

836
01:04:42,809 --> 01:04:44,535
of the Ashland Falls area,

837
01:04:44,639 --> 01:04:47,745
whose body was found today
in what appears to be a suicide.

838
01:04:47,849 --> 01:04:49,851
Yeah.
It's just an awful tragedy.

839
01:04:49,955 --> 01:04:51,991
Another one for Ashland Falls.

840
01:04:52,095 --> 01:04:54,373
That town cannot seem to catch
a break.

841
01:04:54,476 --> 01:04:56,823
Yeah, but Ashland has a problem
that nobody wants to --

842
01:04:59,205 --> 01:05:01,932
- Hello?
- Hey, Maria. You there?

843
01:05:02,036 --> 01:05:03,830
Hey, Ron. Yeah.
What's up?

844
01:05:03,934 --> 01:05:05,660
Did you get on the road yet?

845
01:05:05,763 --> 01:05:07,110
Because they're really
hassling us

846
01:05:07,213 --> 01:05:08,835
about our booth placement again.

847
01:05:08,939 --> 01:05:10,768
Of course they are.

848
01:05:10,872 --> 01:05:13,047
Uh, I will be in the city
in two hours.

849
01:05:13,150 --> 01:05:15,256
- Do not let them move us.
- Okay.

850
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:17,983
I'll try.

851
01:05:18,086 --> 01:05:20,261
This has been going on
for decades in Ashland.

852
01:05:20,364 --> 01:05:23,505
Remember, the entire town
council was found dead in 1980

853
01:05:23,609 --> 01:05:26,577
because they dared to throw open
the books on the town's history.

854
01:05:26,681 --> 01:05:28,441
Now, explain that.

855
01:05:37,450 --> 01:05:39,349
Hello, everyone.

856
01:05:39,452 --> 01:05:41,627
Uh, thank you for being
so understanding

857
01:05:41,730 --> 01:05:43,767
about the late start.

858
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:46,804
It was a long drive back
from the city,

859
01:05:46,908 --> 01:05:48,323
but the convention went well

860
01:05:48,427 --> 01:05:51,464
despite some early
administrative hiccups.

861
01:05:51,568 --> 01:05:55,848
But the good news is that we
sold out of almost everything,

862
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:58,851
including the evening gown
you all made with me last month.

863
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:01,716
Ooh.
And look at this.

864
01:06:10,518 --> 01:06:12,727
I haven't even taken it all
out of the car yet.

865
01:06:12,830 --> 01:06:15,592
Um, Allie, as you can see,
more than enough material

866
01:06:15,695 --> 01:06:18,526
for the bridesmaids' dresses.

867
01:06:18,629 --> 01:06:21,770
Um, so the conventions
are really good

868
01:06:21,874 --> 01:06:25,705
for finding materials that
you won't find at a local chain,

869
01:06:25,809 --> 01:06:31,090
um, whether that be special
imported fabric or just --

870
01:06:36,061 --> 01:06:38,339
Um...

871
01:07:04,468 --> 01:07:08,231
Uh, excuse me, um, one minute.

872
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:16,860
Oh, hey.
Um, sorry to interrupt.

873
01:07:16,963 --> 01:07:19,104
Were you just in my studio?

874
01:07:19,207 --> 01:07:22,245
Uh, no.
Why?

875
01:07:22,521 --> 01:07:25,938
Um, nothing.
It's -- It's nothing.

876
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:29,183
Um, I'm -- I'm sorry to bother.
It's nice to meet you.

877
01:07:46,821 --> 01:07:49,513
I'm...so sorry about that.

878
01:07:49,617 --> 01:07:51,550
Um...

879
01:07:54,311 --> 01:07:57,314
Okay.
Where were we?

880
01:09:01,551 --> 01:09:04,174
- Hey. We're home.
- Hey.

881
01:09:10,007 --> 01:09:11,802
How was the gallery?

882
01:09:11,906 --> 01:09:15,875
Oh.
It was, uh, interesting.

883
01:09:15,979 --> 01:09:18,326
Well, it's hard to compete
with the city stuff.

884
01:09:18,430 --> 01:09:20,742
No.
The artists are all talented.

885
01:09:20,846 --> 01:09:22,468
I'm not being an art snob.

886
01:09:22,572 --> 01:09:25,678
It's just...
the weirdest thing happened.

887
01:09:25,782 --> 01:09:27,577
What's that?

888
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:29,544
I don't really know
how to explain it.

889
01:09:29,648 --> 01:09:32,547
Uh, one minute,
we're standing there

890
01:09:32,651 --> 01:09:35,032
looking at this collection
of paintings.

891
01:09:35,136 --> 01:09:38,519
The next, we're being rushed out
the door like there was a bomb.

892
01:09:39,934 --> 01:09:41,832
Any idea why?

893
01:09:41,936 --> 01:09:45,111
They covered up some painting
and told everybody to leave.

894
01:09:45,215 --> 01:09:47,804
That was the end of our night
out on the town.

895
01:09:47,907 --> 01:09:50,979
Not much else to do around here,
so we came home.

896
01:09:51,083 --> 01:09:52,257
I get it.

897
01:09:53,499 --> 01:09:56,433
Not in the hub of culture
anymore.

898
01:09:56,537 --> 01:09:58,263
I didn't say that.

899
01:09:58,366 --> 01:10:03,440
It's just hard to find something
to do with Isabel.

900
01:10:03,544 --> 01:10:06,098
I mean, I was shocked there was
even one art gallery here,

901
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:07,548
but then thatclosed.

902
01:10:07,651 --> 01:10:09,412
It's like...

903
01:10:09,515 --> 01:10:13,243
I don't know.

904
01:10:18,697 --> 01:10:20,595
How was she?

905
01:10:22,839 --> 01:10:25,359
I can't tell.

906
01:10:25,738 --> 01:10:29,570
But, you know, I'm just
the random sister-in-law

907
01:10:29,673 --> 01:10:32,538
that didn't even know she
existed until three months ago,

908
01:10:32,642 --> 01:10:37,578
so...I wouldn't begin to know
what normal was like for her.

909
01:10:39,338 --> 01:10:44,274
You know, we lived under the
same roof for almost 10 years.

910
01:10:46,345 --> 01:10:48,416
Yeah.

911
01:10:48,899 --> 01:10:52,524
I just feel more like a stranger
to her than a brother.

912
01:10:53,766 --> 01:10:56,666
That's why she's here, right?

913
01:11:24,349 --> 01:11:28,076
Hello, everybody.
I, um...

914
01:11:28,180 --> 01:11:30,734
Um...
Oh, I'm sorry.

915
01:11:30,838 --> 01:11:33,875
It's -- It's been a hectic
few days.

916
01:11:33,979 --> 01:11:37,914
Um, it's cold in this house,

917
01:11:38,017 --> 01:11:41,193
um, even though the temperatures
are still warm

918
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:43,264
here in Ashland Falls.

919
01:11:43,368 --> 01:11:46,267
Uh, but that reminds me.

920
01:11:46,371 --> 01:11:48,442
Fall is definitely here,

921
01:11:48,545 --> 01:11:51,514
and we are going to be making
sweaters from scratch,

922
01:11:51,617 --> 01:11:53,861
which I think you'll have
a lot of fun with.

923
01:11:53,964 --> 01:11:57,416
Uh, knitting sweaters
is a little bit more difficult

924
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:58,762
than making a dress.

925
01:11:58,866 --> 01:12:00,661
But for me,
it's so much more fun

926
01:12:00,764 --> 01:12:03,008
because of all the different
designs you can make.

927
01:12:03,111 --> 01:12:04,768
Uh, think holidays --

928
01:12:04,872 --> 01:12:07,944
um, ugly Christmas sweaters,
Halloween sweaters.

929
01:12:08,047 --> 01:12:11,948
You can really go to town
and be funny and crazy.

930
01:12:12,051 --> 01:12:13,915
Um, like last year,

931
01:12:14,019 --> 01:12:16,021
I made Chuck a "Die Hard"
Christmas sweater

932
01:12:16,124 --> 01:12:18,368
because "Die Hard" is
his favorite Christmas --

933
01:12:18,472 --> 01:12:21,371
Huh.

934
01:12:21,475 --> 01:12:23,753
My sister, Allison,
is calling me.

935
01:12:23,856 --> 01:12:26,756
Um, Allison is a regular watcher
of the vlog,

936
01:12:26,859 --> 01:12:28,551
so I don't know
why she's calling me

937
01:12:28,654 --> 01:12:30,380
when she knows that I'm live.

938
01:12:30,484 --> 01:12:32,382
Um, Allie,
if you're watching this,

939
01:12:32,486 --> 01:12:33,970
can't it wait three minutes?

940
01:12:34,073 --> 01:12:35,489
Thanks.

941
01:12:35,592 --> 01:12:39,596
Um, anyways, uh,
leave it to Chuck to think

942
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:42,219
that a movie about terrorists
is a Christmas movie.

943
01:12:42,323 --> 01:12:43,635
Um, but what I'm trying to say

944
01:12:43,738 --> 01:12:46,362
is that you can really make
anything

945
01:12:46,465 --> 01:12:48,156
once you know the basics
of the sweater.

946
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:50,883
I'm sorry.

947
01:12:50,987 --> 01:12:54,887
I don't know why people are
picking right now to bother me.

948
01:12:57,234 --> 01:13:00,997
Allie, if you are calling
about the bridesmaids' dresses,

949
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:02,136
don't worry.

950
01:13:05,622 --> 01:13:09,902
I have it all taken care of.
See?

951
01:13:10,006 --> 01:13:12,042
You just worry
about the food, okay?

952
01:13:13,665 --> 01:13:16,461
What now?

953
01:13:20,016 --> 01:13:23,226
Hey. Claire.

954
01:13:23,329 --> 01:13:26,505
What's going on?

955
01:13:26,609 --> 01:13:28,818
"Get out of the house now."

956
01:13:30,958 --> 01:13:33,961
Um...

957
01:13:34,064 --> 01:13:36,791
Okay. Uh, Claire, uh,

958
01:13:36,895 --> 01:13:40,416
give me a ring after the show,
I guess.

959
01:13:42,072 --> 01:13:46,594
Um, so the basics
of the sweater are the sa--

960
01:13:49,321 --> 01:13:50,909
I -- someone's playing a joke?

961
01:15:15,303 --> 01:15:19,411
I think I can get us
into some campus housing

962
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:22,828
for the short term.

963
01:15:22,932 --> 01:15:24,761
We're gonna have trouble
selling this place.

964
01:15:32,597 --> 01:15:34,253
Are you taking your pills?

965
01:15:37,498 --> 01:15:39,500
Yes.

966
01:15:39,604 --> 01:15:41,398
Okay.

967
01:15:41,502 --> 01:15:45,506
It's just, the last time
something like this happened --

968
01:15:45,610 --> 01:15:48,198
A thousand people saw it,
Chuck.

969
01:15:48,302 --> 01:15:50,994
I know. But maybe they saw...

970
01:15:57,932 --> 01:16:02,350
I can get us out of here
by tomorrow if you want.

971
01:16:02,454 --> 01:16:04,698
Hell, even tonight.

972
01:16:04,801 --> 01:16:07,735
I just need a little time.

973
01:16:07,839 --> 01:16:11,187
This was a mistake.

974
01:16:11,290 --> 01:16:15,398
I mean, I knew we never
should have left the city.

975
01:16:15,501 --> 01:16:18,781
Isabel would have been fine
on her own in a dorm room.

976
01:16:18,884 --> 01:16:22,405
- No, she needed to --
- You needed!

977
01:16:22,508 --> 01:16:25,270
You needed absolution.

978
01:16:25,373 --> 01:16:28,342
This was your way
of trying to fix everything,

979
01:16:28,445 --> 01:16:31,863
but you didn't need to do
any of it!

980
01:16:31,966 --> 01:16:34,831
We didn't need to do this!

981
01:16:42,874 --> 01:16:45,773
Maria...

982
01:16:45,877 --> 01:16:47,188
I can fix this.

983
01:16:59,753 --> 01:17:01,375
What's going on?

984
01:17:03,791 --> 01:17:06,242
Are you okay, Maria?

985
01:17:06,345 --> 01:17:07,830
Everything's fine.

986
01:17:07,933 --> 01:17:09,659
You start packing.
I'll be back in a little while.

987
01:17:13,111 --> 01:17:15,320
Looking for Helen Foster's
home?

988
01:17:18,426 --> 01:17:20,566
Who is Helen Foster?

989
01:17:32,371 --> 01:17:36,306
Chuck wants me out
after what happened to Maria.

990
01:17:36,410 --> 01:17:38,308
Just like that.

991
01:17:38,412 --> 01:17:40,794
Not on his life.

992
01:17:40,897 --> 01:17:44,038
How's she doing?

993
01:17:44,142 --> 01:17:45,730
Not good.

994
01:17:45,833 --> 01:17:47,904
Probably gonna leave
in a couple days, too.

995
01:18:50,139 --> 01:18:53,004
Isabel.

996
01:18:58,285 --> 01:19:01,253
Come on down here
and talk to your mother.

997
01:19:21,101 --> 01:19:23,724
I know you're there, Maria.

998
01:19:47,058 --> 01:19:49,681
Hey, I'm sorry. I --

999
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:51,787
Maybe I was wrong.

1000
01:19:52,339 --> 01:19:54,686
Maybe I was wrong.
I-I have to go.

1001
01:19:57,275 --> 01:20:00,071
Isabel.

1002
01:20:00,174 --> 01:20:01,003
Maria?

1003
01:20:16,777 --> 01:20:19,815
These dishes won't put
themselves away.

1004
01:20:26,891 --> 01:20:29,376
Where are you, honey?

1005
01:20:35,416 --> 01:20:39,075
Don't you want to see
what you did to me?

1006
01:20:44,494 --> 01:20:45,564
Where are you going?!

1007
01:21:37,789 --> 01:21:40,516
Isabel? Isabel!

1008
01:21:41,482 --> 01:21:42,932
Isabel. Are you okay?

1009
01:21:43,036 --> 01:21:44,865
Where is she?

1010
01:21:44,969 --> 01:21:46,660
- I don't know.
- Where is she?

1011
01:21:46,763 --> 01:21:49,939
I don't know. Are you okay?
Are you hurt? Are you okay?

1012
01:21:50,043 --> 01:21:52,217
It's okay.

1013
01:21:52,321 --> 01:21:54,668
It's okay.

1014
01:21:54,771 --> 01:21:56,359
You're okay.

1015
01:22:04,540 --> 01:22:05,851
You're okay.

1016
01:22:13,066 --> 01:22:14,515
What happened to your face?

1017
01:22:15,723 --> 01:22:18,381
What are you talking about?

1018
01:22:18,485 --> 01:22:19,900
You're bleeding.

1019
01:22:20,004 --> 01:22:21,143
What?

1020
01:22:23,559 --> 01:22:25,250
Here.

1021
01:23:33,422 --> 01:23:35,079
I did it.

1022
01:23:35,182 --> 01:23:36,390
You did it?

1023
01:23:36,494 --> 01:23:39,152
What's going on?

1024
01:23:39,255 --> 01:23:41,568
We need to talk.

1025
01:23:41,671 --> 01:23:44,329
Everybody's obsessed
with street maps,

1026
01:23:44,433 --> 01:23:48,368
either in books or the records
the county has under seal.

1027
01:23:48,471 --> 01:23:50,853
Nobody ever thought
to look at the infrastructure,

1028
01:23:50,956 --> 01:23:52,786
but Ashley did.

1029
01:23:52,889 --> 01:23:54,098
How do you mean?

1030
01:23:54,201 --> 01:23:56,341
It's actually quite brilliant.

1031
01:23:56,445 --> 01:23:58,999
She figured out
that, by the early 1900s,

1032
01:23:59,103 --> 01:24:02,244
this tiny coal town
was mostly electrified.

1033
01:24:02,347 --> 01:24:05,109
So instead of following roads,

1034
01:24:05,212 --> 01:24:07,456
she figured out what we really
should be looking for.

1035
01:24:09,216 --> 01:24:10,942
The power grid.

1036
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:12,806
Exactly.

1037
01:24:12,909 --> 01:24:15,464
It's the one thing the town
never thought to conceal.

1038
01:24:17,086 --> 01:24:20,710
The library is full of books
on the county infrastructure,

1039
01:24:20,814 --> 01:24:22,850
but one book in particular

1040
01:24:22,954 --> 01:24:27,579
actually has a specified map
of the grid layout from 1923.

1041
01:24:27,683 --> 01:24:30,168
Where am I looking?

1042
01:24:30,272 --> 01:24:33,068
Put it side by side
with any current map,

1043
01:24:33,171 --> 01:24:36,692
you can clearly see
the border shrunk.

1044
01:24:36,795 --> 01:24:39,350
Right here.

1045
01:24:39,453 --> 01:24:41,593
There's power lines leading
out that way,

1046
01:24:41,697 --> 01:24:45,045
but today it's not part
of the town.

1047
01:24:45,149 --> 01:24:46,943
Where are they going?

1048
01:24:52,535 --> 01:24:54,434
That's where Forest Road is.

1049
01:24:59,163 --> 01:25:00,371
I'm taking this with me.

1050
01:25:00,474 --> 01:25:02,338
Wait. You're going there now?

1051
01:25:02,442 --> 01:25:03,615
- I'm coming with you.
- Is--

1052
01:25:13,004 --> 01:25:15,213
Hey, Chuck,
ready for your close-up?

1053
01:25:17,905 --> 01:25:20,667
Don't tell me you forgot.

1054
01:25:20,770 --> 01:25:23,221
We're filming
your testimonial today.

1055
01:25:23,325 --> 01:25:24,774
I told you a week ago.

1056
01:25:24,878 --> 01:25:26,776
Now is really
not a good time.

1057
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:28,882
Maria isn't feeling well and...

1058
01:25:29,848 --> 01:25:31,471
Listen...

1059
01:25:31,574 --> 01:25:32,989
I understand that you guys
have been

1060
01:25:33,093 --> 01:25:35,060
going through some problems.

1061
01:25:35,164 --> 01:25:36,579
This guy cost me a lot of money.

1062
01:25:36,683 --> 01:25:39,237
And to rebook him
would set me back.

1063
01:25:39,341 --> 01:25:41,205
Just give me 30 minutes.

1064
01:25:41,308 --> 01:25:42,827
I can do it.

1065
01:25:44,587 --> 01:25:47,072
Hey, hon. How you feeling?

1066
01:25:47,176 --> 01:25:48,867
Never better.

1067
01:25:48,971 --> 01:25:51,146
You go do what you have to do.

1068
01:25:51,249 --> 01:25:54,079
We all know I'm better
on camera anyway.

1069
01:25:54,183 --> 01:25:56,012
Are you sure
you're feeling okay?

1070
01:25:56,116 --> 01:25:58,222
Yeah.

1071
01:26:00,603 --> 01:26:02,950
You go look for Forest Road.

1072
01:26:03,054 --> 01:26:04,883
We'll be fine.

1073
01:26:14,099 --> 01:26:17,241
Hey. One last favor?

1074
01:26:17,827 --> 01:26:20,865
Can you stay here with Maria
until we get back?

1075
01:26:22,729 --> 01:26:24,420
I thought you were gonna ask me
to go with you.

1076
01:26:27,389 --> 01:26:29,701
Thank you for everything.

1077
01:26:29,805 --> 01:26:33,291
If you find it,
then you can thank me.

1078
01:27:06,531 --> 01:27:09,465
Uh, can you zoom in a little
closer on her?

1079
01:27:09,569 --> 01:27:11,226
Tighter.

1080
01:27:11,329 --> 01:27:13,780
Get in tighter.

1081
01:27:13,883 --> 01:27:17,162
No, I don't like that.
I don't like that at all.

1082
01:27:17,266 --> 01:27:19,648
Bring it out. Keep coming.

1083
01:27:19,751 --> 01:27:22,167
Okay, let's see
what that looks like.

1084
01:27:22,271 --> 01:27:24,169
How about something like this?

1085
01:27:24,273 --> 01:27:26,344
Eh. Yeah, okay.

1086
01:27:26,448 --> 01:27:29,761
All right.
Zoom in. A little further.

1087
01:27:32,488 --> 01:27:34,939
All right. That looks great.

1088
01:27:35,042 --> 01:27:37,113
All right, so, Maria,

1089
01:27:37,217 --> 01:27:39,978
please introduce yourself
to the camera.

1090
01:27:40,082 --> 01:27:42,947
My name is Maria.

1091
01:27:43,050 --> 01:27:44,811
And last name?

1092
01:27:47,503 --> 01:27:49,540
My name is Maria.

1093
01:27:50,748 --> 01:27:52,232
Okay, uh, fine.

1094
01:27:52,336 --> 01:27:55,615
Um, tell the camera

1095
01:27:55,718 --> 01:27:59,826
how you found out about me
and Bonnie Davis Realty.

1096
01:28:22,918 --> 01:28:25,058
What do we do if this
is the house?

1097
01:28:25,161 --> 01:28:27,129
We burn it.

1098
01:28:27,232 --> 01:28:30,719
Down to the goddamn ground.

1099
01:28:30,822 --> 01:28:33,963
Maybe we should have
called someone first.

1100
01:28:34,067 --> 01:28:36,897
Look, Izzy...

1101
01:28:37,001 --> 01:28:38,727
I'm gonna find this house.

1102
01:28:38,830 --> 01:28:42,247
If you want to stay behind,
it's okay.

1103
01:28:42,351 --> 01:28:43,732
I understand.

1104
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:11,207
Go ahead, Maria.

1105
01:29:11,311 --> 01:29:15,971
I noticed the first
sign that something was wrong

1106
01:29:16,074 --> 01:29:20,872
when my daughter came home
from school crying.

1107
01:29:20,976 --> 01:29:22,736
Uh, I-I'm sorry.

1108
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:27,396
Maria, are you talking about
how you found out about us?

1109
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:30,537
You want to know how I...

1110
01:29:30,641 --> 01:29:33,402
How you found out
about Bonnie Davis Realty.

1111
01:29:33,506 --> 01:29:35,439
Oh, I see.

1112
01:29:35,542 --> 01:29:39,166
And daughter -- you mean
your sister-in-law, right?

1113
01:29:40,409 --> 01:29:42,169
What did I say?

1114
01:29:42,273 --> 01:29:44,240
You said daughter.

1115
01:29:44,344 --> 01:29:48,037
I guess she kind of feels
that way between you and Chuck.

1116
01:29:48,141 --> 01:29:49,522
Let me start again.

1117
01:29:52,835 --> 01:29:56,425
After the crying came the blood.

1118
01:30:00,118 --> 01:30:04,260
I began to notice drops of blood
in the bathroom sink.

1119
01:30:54,069 --> 01:30:56,968
This is her house.

1120
01:30:57,072 --> 01:30:58,211
It has to be.

1121
01:31:01,179 --> 01:31:03,043
Sad.

1122
01:31:06,357 --> 01:31:08,117
What happened to her, I mean.

1123
01:31:10,465 --> 01:31:12,674
She's gotten her revenge
100 times over.

1124
01:31:37,215 --> 01:31:40,287
Where do we start?

1125
01:31:40,391 --> 01:31:44,291
Look for anything that confirms
that this is the house.

1126
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:49,676
I had to do something.

1127
01:31:51,402 --> 01:31:56,269
I had to let them know what
they were allowing to happen

1128
01:31:56,372 --> 01:31:58,823
was an abomination.

1129
01:32:01,861 --> 01:32:05,830
I was civil with
the Clarke family at first.

1130
01:32:08,005 --> 01:32:10,801
So, so civil.

1131
01:32:13,286 --> 01:32:15,909
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

1132
01:32:17,911 --> 01:32:22,329
I wrote letters
detailing every abuse

1133
01:32:22,433 --> 01:32:24,331
my daughter was experiencing.

1134
01:32:27,162 --> 01:32:29,889
That should have been
an end of it.

1135
01:32:31,546 --> 01:32:32,892
It should have been.

1136
01:32:35,584 --> 01:32:38,035
But it only got worse.

1137
01:32:39,623 --> 01:32:42,936
The school promised to do
something...

1138
01:32:44,904 --> 01:32:48,355
...and they never did.

1139
01:32:48,459 --> 01:32:51,393
I went to the town council.

1140
01:32:51,496 --> 01:32:54,638
They wouldn't even see me.

1141
01:32:58,952 --> 01:33:04,475
I wrote...so...many...letters.

1142
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:07,167
They went unanswered.

1143
01:33:07,271 --> 01:33:10,239
I showed up at their house.

1144
01:33:13,242 --> 01:33:14,865
Nothing.

1145
01:33:18,351 --> 01:33:20,146
Nothing!

1146
01:34:33,944 --> 01:34:38,845
- This house used to be
15 Rose Lane.

1147
01:34:43,022 --> 01:34:44,713
Izzy!

1148
01:34:44,817 --> 01:34:47,578
Izzy. Izzy.
We have to go right now.

1149
01:34:47,682 --> 01:34:50,029
Izzy. Izzy.

1150
01:34:51,996 --> 01:34:53,446
Izzy.

1151
01:34:56,345 --> 01:34:57,415
Maria?

1152
01:35:00,902 --> 01:35:03,111
I noticed...

1153
01:35:03,214 --> 01:35:07,287
the first sign
that something was wrong

1154
01:35:07,391 --> 01:35:11,326
when my daughter came home
from school...

1155
01:35:11,429 --> 01:35:13,673
crying.

1156
01:35:13,777 --> 01:35:16,055
Who is your daughter?

1157
01:35:19,058 --> 01:35:20,507
Mary.

1158
01:35:22,061 --> 01:35:25,236
And where is Mary?

1159
01:35:27,376 --> 01:35:28,999
Dead!

1160
01:36:37,792 --> 01:36:39,138
Izzy?

1161
01:36:49,873 --> 01:36:51,806
So sorry.

1162
01:36:55,223 --> 01:36:56,811
I saw thing.

1163
01:37:01,850 --> 01:37:02,886
Chuck.

1164
01:37:25,770 --> 01:37:27,703
Izzy!
