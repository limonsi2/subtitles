3
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:23,191
(Wind blowing)

4
00:00:23,192 --> 00:00:25,093
(Soft rock music)

5
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,880
- Princess Berry, where are you?

6
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:55,683
(Magical music)

7
00:01:58,186 --> 00:01:59,186
Princess Berry is late.

8
00:01:59,387 --> 00:02:01,222
Where could she be?

9
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:02,989
- I'm here, I'm sorry.

10
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,393
(Queen laughs)

11
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:07,093
- [Queen] There you are.

12
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:09,095
- I'm sorry I'm late, my queen.

13
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:10,798
It was the donkey's fault.

14
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:12,732
(Tongue clicking)

15
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,468
- It's best not to blame others
for your own misfortunes.

16
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,905
- But this time it really
was the donkey's fault.

17
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:20,508
He fell down flat on his belly!

18
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:23,244
- On his belly?

19
00:02:26,214 --> 00:02:27,214
- [Princess Berry]
Yes, flat on his belly

20
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:28,516
down by the stream.

21
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:30,384
(Laughing)

22
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,220
(Elevator beeping)

23
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:44,765
- [Female recording] 42nd floor.

24
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:29,310
(Finger tapping)

25
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,979
(Sighing)

26
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:44,525
(Soft music)

27
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:54,802
- [Therapist] And how was
the dream different this time?

28
00:03:56,337 --> 00:03:58,577
- [Frankie voiceover] This
time, everything goes dark and

29
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,377
I'm there alone in the water,

30
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:08,327
desperately trying to climb out,

31
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:13,487
but I can't.

32
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,429
This time, I feel like
something is pulling me down.

33
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:30,971
- [Therapist] Hm.

34
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,580
Can you describe what it
is that's pulling you down?

35
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:42,516
- I don't know.

36
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:44,517
Frankie king, Blaze talent,

37
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:45,785
reading for the role
of surprised woman.

38
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,788
Maybe my job, my relationship.

39
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:55,061
- [Therapist] And
what's the status there?

40
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:58,532
- Dax moved out so

41
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:00,887
it's over.
- All right, we got it.

42
00:05:03,371 --> 00:05:04,804
Let's rap on Frankie.

43
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,272
- [Frankie voiceover] We're
not good for each other.

44
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:07,273
(Crew applauding)

45
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:09,276
- [Therapist]
This is a big step.

46
00:05:09,277 --> 00:05:11,412
- [Frankie voiceover] Yeah.

47
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:13,981
- [Therapist] So
how does it feel

48
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,550
to close that chapter?

49
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:19,145
- [Frankie voiceover]
I don't know.

50
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:24,563
I still have a lot of
open chapters in my life.

51
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:33,967
Go inside and
wash up for dinner.

52
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:37,649
- [Princess Berry] Oh, I
surely don't deserve dinner.

53
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:39,649
I was late and i'm
terribly upset with myself.

54
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,710
- Accidents happen.

55
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:46,671
Now, run along and let me
have a few words with this donkey.

56
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:51,351
- [Princess Berry]
Thank you, my queen.

57
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,755
- And what do you
have to say for yourself?

58
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:00,312
And this is where the
donkey starts talking.

59
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:05,098
- Okay, cut.

60
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:06,899
Back to one.

61
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:08,334
(Crew chattering)

62
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:14,808
So, I think we're slipping
a bit too far into caricature.

63
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,647
- But she is a
caricature, Marcus.

64
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,449
- Yeah, but we need
her more tender,

65
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:25,919
a bit more real, a bit
more grandmotherly.

66
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:29,790
- Okay, more grandmotherly.

67
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:32,092
- And just a bit more.

68
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,060
(Inhaling softly)

69
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,864
(Inhaling softly)

70
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:38,498
- You got it.

71
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,199
- Okay, great.
- Okay.

72
00:06:57,551 --> 00:07:01,121
(Disconcerting music)

73
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:31,585
(Soft gasp)

74
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:33,754
(Hands clapping)

75
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:36,456
(Laughing excitedly)

76
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:57,477
Hey Grayson, it's Frankie.

77
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,884
I got your message.

78
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:05,998
I don't really know what to say.

79
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:10,090
Call me back.

80
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:18,599
(Crew chattering)

81
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,334
(Door humming)

82
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,919
- [Kim] I'm so sorry,
that's terrible news.

83
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:32,371
- [Frankie] I hadn't
spoken to them in years.

84
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:33,781
- Well, still.

85
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:35,481
- How long do you need?

86
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:38,064
- I don't know, a
week, a couple days.

87
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,521
- I lost my father
three years ago.

88
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:45,793
Couldn't sleep, got
addicted to ativan.

89
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,062
- We only have the
donkey booked until Friday

90
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:53,042
so that's gonna
be a bit of an issue.

91
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,101
- Jesus, Marcus.

92
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:56,468
We can get, we can
get another donkey.

93
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,138
- But this is a
really great donkey.

94
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:00,617
- No, can you give
us some space?

95
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:02,776
(Marcus sighs)

96
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,325
Look, I'll see what I can swing.

97
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:08,315
Take the rest of the week.

98
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,750
- I may not even need to
go, we weren't very close.

99
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,789
- Frankie, you have to go.

100
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:17,991
I'll see what I can do.

101
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:21,795
Take the week.

102
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,270
(Disconcerting music)

103
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:49,723
- [Frankie voiceover]
I'm scared...

104
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:52,726
To go back.

105
00:09:56,263 --> 00:10:00,733
But I feel like I have to.

106
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:02,054
- [Therapist] And
what's the fear?

107
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,806
What's scary about this?

108
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,176
- [Frankie] Judgment.

109
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,003
- [Therapist] Who
are you picturing now?

110
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,448
- [Frankie] Everyone.

111
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,888
My brother.

112
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:25,325
- [Therapist] Are
you in touch with him?

113
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:26,325
- [Frankie] Grayson?

114
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,761
Not really.

115
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,230
He's a...

116
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,366
Difficult person.

117
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,729
I think he resents me
for leaving the family.

118
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:43,922
- [Therapist] And how
do you feel about it,

119
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:48,782
your decision to leave?

120
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,150
- [Frankie voiceover] I
did what I thought I needed

121
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,756
at the time.

122
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:57,589
(Planes humming)

123
00:11:04,732 --> 00:11:08,435
- I'm happy to inform you
you're eligible for an upgrade.

124
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:10,771
No extra cost.

125
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:12,404
- An upgrade?

126
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,107
- Correct, you reserved
an economy vehicle.

127
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:15,943
It looks like I can upgrade
you to a full-size vehicle,

128
00:11:15,944 --> 00:11:18,445
four doors, a lot more room.

129
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:20,680
- It's just me.

130
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:22,381
- Well, treat yourself.

131
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,217
- Okay.

132
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:27,286
- Excellent.

133
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:28,055
So, what brings you to
this area, work or pleasure?

134
00:11:28,056 --> 00:11:31,925
- It's work, hard work.

135
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:35,653
- And will you be wanting
our collision coverage today?

136
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:41,001
- Yeah, please.

137
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:53,446
(Horn honking)

138
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,850
(Laughing)

139
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:58,384
Great.

140
00:12:09,997 --> 00:12:13,801
(Upbeat rock music)

141
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,357
- Throughout the
whole thing, not one.

142
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:12,993
I think that's that girl.

143
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:14,726
- Oh, don't talk.

144
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:15,928
- Turn around.

145
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:16,929
- I don't want to look.

146
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:18,931
- Turn around.

147
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:20,492
Isn't she the one that
was on that show?

148
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:23,269
- Excuse me?

149
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:27,826
I don't mean to be a bother.

150
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,642
- No.

151
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:32,479
- Are you the one that's in
the chocolate bar commercial?

152
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,849
- Yeah.

153
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:37,449
- It's her!

154
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:39,086
- For heaven's sake, we
knew we had seen yous.

155
00:13:39,087 --> 00:13:41,354
I told you, Betty.

156
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:43,256
Can we get a picture?

157
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:44,991
Get in there, Betty!

158
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:46,994
- [Betty] Do you mind?

159
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:52,866
(Camera clicking)

160
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,600
(Crickets chirping)

161
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:28,535
(Crying)

162
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:30,537
(Breathing heavily)

163
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:17,017
(Birds chirping)

164
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:19,619
(Motor humming)

165
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:40,373
- Hey.
- Grayson.

166
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:42,928
- Were you gonna
tell me you're in town

167
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:44,977
or you're just gonna wait for me

168
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:46,345
to find ya roaming the streets?

169
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:48,186
- I'm sorry, I was gonna
call you this morning.

170
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,842
- Come on, get in,
let's grab breakfast.

171
00:15:51,218 --> 00:15:53,653
- Yeah, okay.

172
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:03,430
- Don't we see you on
TV all the time, that show?

173
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:06,266
- Yeah.

174
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,136
- That little shithead loves it.

175
00:16:10,037 --> 00:16:11,404
I guess that's kids nowadays.

176
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:13,273
That's all they want is
screens and screens.

177
00:16:13,274 --> 00:16:16,409
- What is he, three now?

178
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,278
- No, he's four.

179
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:19,811
- Wow.

180
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:22,548
- Mm-hm.

181
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,510
When we try and tell him that

182
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:26,585
that's his auntie
Frankie up there,

183
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:28,426
(laughs) He just looks
at us like we're morons.

184
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,692
Well, that's auntie Frankie!

185
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:35,762
Auntie Frankie king. (Laughs)

186
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:39,898
That's a heck of a
name you picked there.

187
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:42,035
Is that real, Frankie king?

188
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:44,003
Does it say that on
your driver's license or?

189
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:45,138
- It's a stage name.

190
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:47,440
- A stage name.

191
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:49,541
- Yeah, my agent
thought it would...

192
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:51,578
Would you excuse
me for a moment?

193
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:53,446
- Fill your boots.

194
00:16:57,884 --> 00:17:01,454
(Exhaling)

195
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:09,429
So how long you in town for?

196
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,031
- [Frankie voiceover]
I don't know.

197
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:13,933
How long should
I be in town for?

198
00:17:13,934 --> 00:17:15,174
- I don't really care, I guess.

199
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:18,305
I'm sorry if that's...

200
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:20,572
- No, it's fine.

201
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:22,185
It's just you haven't
really been a part of things

202
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:23,610
for a while here, Frankie.

203
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,097
You can't just
waltz in and expect

204
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:27,853
to run the show, you know?

205
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:29,661
- I don't expect
to run the show.

206
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:39,459
- You married?

207
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,360
Got a boyfriend or?

208
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:46,433
- No.

209
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:47,899
- Sucks.

210
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:54,550
You know, just 'cause your
eggs aren't gettin' any younger.

211
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:57,076
I actually just read
a study, you know,

212
00:17:58,178 --> 00:17:59,978
it's actually not safe
for women your age

213
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:02,179
'cause the kids they come
out all retarded or, you know,

214
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,702
it's just a roll of the dice.
- I got a salad for you.

215
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:06,319
Burger and fries for you.

216
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,820
Can I get you
folks anything else?

217
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:09,489
- No, Janice, we're
perfect, thank you.

218
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,123
- Okay, great, enjoy that.

219
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:12,592
(Soft country music)

220
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:16,755
- What makes you
think I even want kids?

221
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:21,501
- Hm?

222
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:23,302
- [Frankie] Nevermind.

223
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:26,905
- So they, um.

224
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:31,957
They got the
autopsy report back.

225
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,560
I guess dad just had a
heart attack behind the wheel.

226
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:41,321
Yeah.

227
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,190
Just like that.

228
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:47,506
The car rolls like
seven times so

229
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:50,330
he just takes mom with him.

230
00:18:56,403 --> 00:19:01,607
Anyhow. (Clears throat)

231
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:03,343
Got a meeting with
the lawyer later on so.

232
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,613
You can come, I guess.

233
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:08,847
- It's up to you.

234
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:22,629
(Phone ringing)

235
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:25,765
- Grayson Bingley.

236
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:27,467
Yeah.

237
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:29,868
Yeah, for sure.

238
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:31,203
I'll be right there.

239
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:32,605
Okay.

240
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,554
Hey, I gotta pop by work
for a minute, you mind?

241
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:40,747
- Fill your boots.

242
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,557
- Hey.
- Hey.

243
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:52,525
- How's it goin'?
- All right.

244
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:53,686
- This is my sister, Frankie.

245
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,473
Frankie, this is
my boss, Rhonda.

246
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,195
- Hi, I didn't know
you had a sister.

247
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,232
- Yeah, well, voila. (Chuckles)

248
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,602
So what's up with that pipe?

249
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:04,837
- There was a break
in the line, I'll show you.

250
00:20:04,838 --> 00:20:06,205
- All right.

251
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:07,707
Just give me a
bit, I'll find you.

252
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,476
- Sure.

253
00:20:11,278 --> 00:20:12,358
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah.

254
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:32,599
(Machine humming)

255
00:20:51,318 --> 00:20:56,355
- All right, I know that
none of this is easy

256
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:57,656
so I'll try and make this as
painless as possible, okay?

257
00:20:57,657 --> 00:20:59,577
All right, so the last
amendment to this document

258
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:02,187
was in 2015 when
Grayson's son was born.

259
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,640
Grayson, you've been
appointed executor of the estate.

260
00:21:04,664 --> 00:21:07,266
- Okay.

261
00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:09,034
What does that mean?

262
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,270
- Well, basically
it's a responsibility

263
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,271
to fulfill the will,
close the estate,

264
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,432
all of its assets, tax stuff.

265
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:15,807
There's a list.

266
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:18,796
- What about the house
or what's inside the house

267
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,914
like jewelry or China
or, I don't know.

268
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:25,584
- It's up to you.

269
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:26,185
Keep it, sell it, whatever.

270
00:21:26,186 --> 00:21:27,487
- Okay.

271
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,188
And what if I get hit
by a bus tomorrow?

272
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:31,967
- Then it goes down the line
to your spouse, your child.

273
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:33,626
- Okay.
- Okay?

274
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:36,581
All right, so I am going
to paraphrase here.

275
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:38,349
We give, devise and
bequeath our estate

276
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,032
and all of its related assets,

277
00:21:41,668 --> 00:21:42,335
all tangible personal
property, money, real estate

278
00:21:42,336 --> 00:21:43,770
to Grayson Bingley.

279
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:46,038
Please see appendix five.

280
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,940
Appendix five states that
$25,000 from the estate

281
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:51,043
is to be donated to the
bankview united church.

282
00:21:51,944 --> 00:21:54,080
- Oh, that makes sense.

283
00:21:55,782 --> 00:21:57,282
I mean, our family is a pretty
big part of the church so.

284
00:21:57,283 --> 00:21:59,886
- I also have a small rsp and
$12,000 in a checking account.

285
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:04,924
I also have two life
insurance policies

286
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:08,236
with Grayson named
beneficiary on those.

287
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,663
- What about Frankie?

288
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,332
- I'm sorry, Frankie.

289
00:22:19,406 --> 00:22:22,675
- Makes sense.

290
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:25,423
- Okay, I'm gonna
need some signatures

291
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:26,446
to get the ball rolling.

292
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:29,081
- Yeah.

293
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:30,816
Sure.

294
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:34,987
- I'm gonna wait outside.

295
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:41,528
(Sighs)

296
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:05,652
(Doorbell chiming)

297
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:12,892
- Hi, can I just get a
black coffee please?

298
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:23,770
(Boots thudding)

299
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:37,049
Frankie?

300
00:23:37,784 --> 00:23:38,784
- Hi.

301
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,620
- It's Bruce.

302
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:43,556
- Yeah, I know, of course.

303
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:45,056
Hi.

304
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:46,793
- I didn't know if
you recognized me.

305
00:23:46,794 --> 00:23:48,060
- No, you look the same.

306
00:23:48,528 --> 00:23:50,530
- Liar.

307
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,164
- Well, I recognized you so.

308
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:55,325
- [Bruce] I assume you're
in town 'cause of your folks.

309
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,970
- Yeah, you heard it?

310
00:23:58,771 --> 00:23:59,972
- Yeah, I'm so sorry.

311
00:24:00,707 --> 00:24:02,208
It's a real tragedy.

312
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:04,544
- Thanks.

313
00:24:05,344 --> 00:24:06,384
- So where you livin' now?

314
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,860
- I move back and forth
between la and Vancouver

315
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:13,452
so I'm kind of all
over the place.

316
00:24:14,687 --> 00:24:16,331
- Yeah, I heard you're
doing the acting thing.

317
00:24:16,355 --> 00:24:17,395
- [Frankie] Yeah. (Laughs)

318
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:18,825
- Some folks were saying
they saw you on TV.

319
00:24:18,826 --> 00:24:20,126
- Yeah, I'm in a few shoes.

320
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:23,772
- I don't actually own a TV
so I wouldn't have seen ya.

321
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,833
- So what are you
doing these days?

322
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:29,467
- [Bruce] Still got
the family farm.

323
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:30,970
Teaching at b high.

324
00:24:31,671 --> 00:24:33,239
- You're teaching?

325
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,793
- Yeah, yeah, it's
just mechanics.

326
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,010
- [Frankie] That's great.

327
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:42,739
- [Bruce] Yeah, well, it was
great running into ya, Frankie.

328
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:46,719
- Yeah, nice to see you.

329
00:24:47,453 --> 00:24:48,688
- Yeah, really nice.

330
00:24:49,856 --> 00:24:51,216
All right, well,
condolences again.

331
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:54,827
And I'll see you around.

332
00:24:55,728 --> 00:24:56,863
- [Frankie] See you around.

333
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:00,699
(Doorbell chiming)

334
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:19,719
(Children chattering)

335
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,955
(Motor humming)

336
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:27,226
(Horn honking)

337
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:30,597
- You okay?

338
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,964
- Yeah, I'm fine.

339
00:25:32,965 --> 00:25:34,725
- Listen, just 'cause
you're not in the will.

340
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:37,608
- I'm not actually here
for the money, Grayson.

341
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:40,306
- You want a lift back?

342
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:44,075
- [Frankie] No, I'm gonna
walk around for a bit.

343
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:47,113
- All right.

344
00:25:55,454 --> 00:25:59,025
Hey.

345
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:03,413
I have an appointment
tomorrow with the funeral stuff.

346
00:26:04,931 --> 00:26:06,265
If you wanna come to that.

347
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:11,003
- Yeah, okay.

348
00:26:11,638 --> 00:26:12,839
- All right.

349
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:14,305
At 10am.

350
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:16,808
- See ya then.

351
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:18,810
(Motor humming)

352
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:29,689
I'm not quite sure how
to be out here, ya know?

353
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:37,630
How to smile back at people
who smile at you on the street.

354
00:26:39,165 --> 00:26:43,869
- [Therapist] And you don't
get this feeling at home?

355
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:46,372
- [Frankie] No, not
really, it's suffocating here.

356
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:51,243
- [Therapist] Why
do you think that is?

357
00:26:52,812 --> 00:26:54,589
- [Frankie voiceover] I
don't know, maybe because I

358
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:55,733
thought I'd never come back.

359
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,717
- [Therapist] But you did.

360
00:27:00,186 --> 00:27:01,186
- Yeah.

361
00:27:01,688 --> 00:27:02,288
(Distorted speech)

362
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:04,891
Sheila?

363
00:27:06,693 --> 00:27:07,693
(Distorted speech)

364
00:27:07,727 --> 00:27:08,861
Sheila?

365
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,461
(Finger tapping)

366
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:15,066
(Sighing)

367
00:27:33,552 --> 00:27:37,189
(Door creaking)

368
00:27:42,962 --> 00:27:46,766
(Clock ticking softly)

369
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:55,174
(Floor creaking)

370
00:27:55,742 --> 00:27:58,010
(Alarm ringing)

371
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:24,436
(Soft piano music)

372
00:28:45,257 --> 00:28:48,828
Right.

373
00:29:12,852 --> 00:29:16,488
(Birds chirping)

374
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:44,316
(Vibrator buzzing)

375
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:48,519
(Sighing)

376
00:30:56,588 --> 00:31:00,159
(Bed creaking)

377
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:11,437
(Bed creaking)

378
00:31:36,295 --> 00:31:40,099
(Disconcerting music)

379
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:48,274
(Door shutting)

380
00:31:49,308 --> 00:31:51,077
(Disconcerting music)

381
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,248
(Gasping)

382
00:31:58,951 --> 00:32:00,751
(Water splashing)

383
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:01,687
(Screaming)

384
00:32:01,688 --> 00:32:03,322
(Gasping)

385
00:32:03,956 --> 00:32:05,591
(Panting)

386
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:23,609
Wha?

387
00:32:49,535 --> 00:32:53,139
(Insects chirping)

388
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:57,736
(Mysterious music)

389
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:35,141
- I don't really know
how it all shakes down

390
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:38,086
but apparently I'm in
charge of the estate so.

391
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,546
- You're executor.

392
00:34:41,347 --> 00:34:42,447
- [Grayson] That's it.

393
00:34:42,448 --> 00:34:43,415
- [Pastor] How are you doing?

394
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:44,350
Are you getting enough help?

395
00:34:44,351 --> 00:34:45,417
- Yeah, yeah.

396
00:34:46,452 --> 00:34:47,452
My sister showed
up so. (Chuckles)

397
00:34:47,453 --> 00:34:49,855
I don't know how much help

398
00:34:51,056 --> 00:34:51,823
she's gonna be.
- Your sister?

399
00:34:51,824 --> 00:34:53,090
- Yeah, she's back.

400
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:53,959
She might come for your
share so watch out. (Chuckles)

401
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,862
Ah, speak of the devil.

402
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,230
- Oh, not literally.

403
00:34:59,231 --> 00:35:00,565
- Ah, depends on
who you're asking.

404
00:35:00,566 --> 00:35:02,767
- [Grayson] Frankie,
this is pastor Neil.

405
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:04,034
- Frankie, it is such a
pleasure to finally meet you.

406
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:06,138
And my condolences.

407
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:08,174
- Thank you.

408
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:10,608
- The pastor is gonna
be conducting the service

409
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,144
for mom and dad at his church.

410
00:35:13,412 --> 00:35:14,280
- Your folks were such a
big part of this community

411
00:35:14,281 --> 00:35:16,315
and the church.

412
00:35:17,015 --> 00:35:18,015
- Don't I know it.

413
00:35:18,884 --> 00:35:20,218
- [Grayson] Well, hopefully
you won't turn to dust

414
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:20,652
when you walk through
the church doors.

415
00:35:20,653 --> 00:35:22,421
- I just might.

416
00:35:23,355 --> 00:35:24,223
- I doubt she'll turn to dust.

417
00:35:24,223 --> 00:35:25,157
- I'm not very religious.

418
00:35:25,158 --> 00:35:26,591
- She's an atheist actually.

419
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,112
Or what, you an
anarchist, what are you

420
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,761
calling yourself nowadays?
- Right, thank you, Grayson.

421
00:35:29,762 --> 00:35:30,802
And why am I here exactly?

422
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:32,723
- Okay, I have to
go, but please do

423
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,302
take a look at those
passages that I sent you.

424
00:35:37,903 --> 00:35:40,184
If there are any changes and
if you want to say something.

425
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:44,176
Okay?

426
00:35:46,512 --> 00:35:47,179
I'll see you both
at the service then.

427
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,314
- Thank you.

428
00:35:52,551 --> 00:35:56,188
- I knew your
parents quite well.

429
00:35:57,723 --> 00:35:59,934
We spent quite a bit of time
together before my wife passed.

430
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:02,294
- Which one of these
did you put your wife in?

431
00:36:02,861 --> 00:36:04,730
(Clears throat)

432
00:36:05,631 --> 00:36:06,791
- Cherry wood, it's the best.

433
00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:08,467
- Mom didn't want to be buried.

434
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,190
I always remember
her saying that.

435
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:14,706
- She didn't like the bugs.

436
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:17,175
- Cremation is
also a lovely option.

437
00:36:19,445 --> 00:36:21,179
- $11,000, for this? (Knocking)

438
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:26,717
- It's cherry.

439
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:27,985
- You know, I can
build one of them

440
00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:29,587
and Bury 'em out back the
house for next to nothing.

441
00:36:29,588 --> 00:36:31,268
- Well, that would
be illegal, Mr. Bingley.

442
00:36:31,423 --> 00:36:32,423
- This is robbery, sir.

443
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:34,192
- Sorry you feel that way.

444
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,194
This is my livelihood,

445
00:36:37,496 --> 00:36:38,163
no different than you
growing your stuff.

446
00:36:38,164 --> 00:36:40,832
- I disagree.

447
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:43,434
You gotta die, there's
no choice there.

448
00:36:43,435 --> 00:36:44,875
- I run a respectable
family business

449
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:47,697
much like your
parents did, Mr. Bingley.

450
00:36:48,607 --> 00:36:50,447
None of us dipped our
toes in the black market.

451
00:36:52,511 --> 00:36:53,945
- We'll burn 'em.

452
00:36:56,815 --> 00:36:57,815
Burn 'em up.

453
00:37:00,686 --> 00:37:01,686
- All right.

454
00:37:03,389 --> 00:37:04,089
The cremation fee
is $2400 per body.

455
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:05,370
- You got a two-for-one on that?

456
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:07,926
- Um, no.

457
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:18,570
(Wheels clattering)

458
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:25,877
(Lift buzzing)

459
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:45,997
- Do you wanna maybe
come over for dinner tonight?

460
00:37:46,865 --> 00:37:49,735
To see marn?

461
00:37:50,336 --> 00:37:51,403
(Clears throat)

462
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:53,170
Meet the little guy.

463
00:37:55,073 --> 00:37:58,644
- That would be nice.

464
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,512
Thank you.

465
00:38:02,247 --> 00:38:03,247
(Door clattering)

466
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:40,919
(Phone buzzing)

467
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,755
- [Kim] Frankie, how ya doin'?

468
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:47,617
- [Frankie] Oh, you
know, i'm stuck deep

469
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:48,860
inside the asshole
of the country.

470
00:38:48,861 --> 00:38:49,928
I'm swell, hun.

471
00:38:50,529 --> 00:38:51,530
(Kim laughs)

472
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:54,799
- [Kim] So, look, I tried my
best but we kinda need you

473
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,569
back on Saturday to
shoot the donkey out.

474
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:00,772
I'm sorry, Frankie.

475
00:39:01,407 --> 00:39:02,508
Frankie?

476
00:39:06,111 --> 00:39:07,355
- That's two days from now, Kim.

477
00:39:07,379 --> 00:39:08,379
The funeral's on Sunday.

478
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,880
- [Kim] Yeah.

479
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:11,750
Well, I guess it's
Sophie's choice then, hun.

480
00:39:11,751 --> 00:39:13,752
I wish I had better news.

481
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:15,854
- It's not a Sophie's choice,
my fucking parents died.

482
00:39:15,855 --> 00:39:17,423
- [Kim] I know.

483
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:19,189
I know, Frankie.

484
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,691
I'm just the messenger here.

485
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:21,593
I tried to get the
network to consider...

486
00:39:21,594 --> 00:39:22,828
- Can't they push to Monday?

487
00:39:23,562 --> 00:39:25,764
- [Kim] My hands are tied.

488
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,365
I'm sorry.

489
00:39:28,133 --> 00:39:29,173
- So what if I don't show?

490
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:31,803
What, are they
gonna kill her off?

491
00:39:31,804 --> 00:39:33,104
- [Kim] Maybe, I don't know.

492
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,041
Look, I'm sorry, Frankie.

493
00:39:37,476 --> 00:39:38,809
The same thing happened
to me when I was with...

494
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,045
- Yeah. (Phone beeping)

495
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:43,482
Fuck, fuck!

496
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:53,091
(Engine revving)

497
00:40:00,699 --> 00:40:04,503
(Mysterious music)

498
00:41:00,225 --> 00:41:03,795
(Children chattering)

499
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:35,661
Hey ya, bud.

500
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:37,427
What are you selling?

501
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:39,396
- Lemonade.

502
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:41,131
- Did you make it?

503
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:43,534
- All by myself.

504
00:41:43,535 --> 00:41:44,535
- May I have a glass?

505
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,337
- Sure.
- How much is it?

506
00:41:47,573 --> 00:41:48,907
- [Jude] For about $2.

507
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:52,978
- Does this work?

508
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:54,580
Yeah.

509
00:41:56,582 --> 00:41:58,102
- And you got, so
don't keep the money?

510
00:41:58,684 --> 00:42:00,444
- [Frankie] No, no, that
money's for you now.

511
00:42:02,988 --> 00:42:05,691
Is it good?

512
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:07,291
- Mm-hmm.

513
00:42:09,695 --> 00:42:10,695
- [Frankie] Thanks, bud.

514
00:42:12,698 --> 00:42:13,938
- I see you met the little man.

515
00:42:14,933 --> 00:42:16,000
- [Frankie] Yeah, he's
quite the entrepreneur.

516
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:18,069
- Oh yeah.

517
00:42:19,304 --> 00:42:20,171
Oh, buddy, I ought to
be taking financial advice

518
00:42:20,172 --> 00:42:21,573
from you, eh?

519
00:42:22,708 --> 00:42:24,188
Did you meet, do
you know who this is?

520
00:42:24,843 --> 00:42:25,910
- Auntie Frankie, she has
crazy hair, I don't like it!

521
00:42:25,911 --> 00:42:28,546
- (Laughs) You don't like it.

522
00:42:29,314 --> 00:42:30,314
It's growing on me.

523
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,383
You wanna go on
inside to see marnie?

524
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,383
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

525
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:34,753
All right, buddy, close up shop.

526
00:42:34,753 --> 00:42:35,753
- Okay, close, everyone!

527
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:38,368
- [Frankie] Thanks,
glad I caught you.

528
00:42:45,597 --> 00:42:49,267
- Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah!

529
00:42:52,203 --> 00:42:55,774
- Hey.

530
00:42:56,341 --> 00:42:57,341
(Lips smacking)

531
00:42:58,509 --> 00:42:59,845
You remember Frankie?

532
00:43:00,646 --> 00:43:01,713
- Frankie, holy shit!

533
00:43:04,149 --> 00:43:05,250
It's been forever.

534
00:43:06,117 --> 00:43:07,652
Sorry, hands.

535
00:43:07,653 --> 00:43:08,253
- Oh, it's nice to
see you again.

536
00:43:08,254 --> 00:43:10,889
- Yeah, it's been ages.

537
00:43:11,657 --> 00:43:14,091
- [Frankie] Yeah.

538
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:14,826
- We oughta have some
more people die around here

539
00:43:14,826 --> 00:43:15,727
so you can come more often.

540
00:43:15,727 --> 00:43:16,727
- Oh, come on, marn.

541
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:17,963
- I brought some wine.

542
00:43:19,064 --> 00:43:20,424
I don't know what
you guys like so.

543
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:23,633
- [Grayson] I don't
really drink so.

544
00:43:23,902 --> 00:43:25,836
- Well, I sure as heck do.

545
00:43:25,837 --> 00:43:27,272
Crank it open, sister!

546
00:43:28,707 --> 00:43:29,707
- Okay.

547
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,945
- And I'm at the end of my rope.

548
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:36,313
We're sitting there on
that runway like hour four

549
00:43:36,314 --> 00:43:38,816
or five and we haven't
even taken off yet.

550
00:43:38,817 --> 00:43:40,057
And I'm thinking to myself like

551
00:43:41,152 --> 00:43:42,432
drive the fuckin'
plane, will ya,

552
00:43:42,921 --> 00:43:44,241
please, Mr. Driver,
sir, you know?

553
00:43:44,322 --> 00:43:45,857
- All right.

554
00:43:47,058 --> 00:43:48,092
- No, no, no, I
know, it's a chore.

555
00:43:48,093 --> 00:43:49,573
- Yeah, it's always
a pain in the ass.

556
00:43:49,795 --> 00:43:51,195
Something always
goes wrong, always.

557
00:43:51,697 --> 00:43:53,057
- Yeah, that's why
we don't travel.

558
00:43:53,098 --> 00:43:55,000
- The burgers were
great, thank you.

559
00:43:57,268 --> 00:43:58,668
- [Marnie] Well,
thank you, Frankie.

560
00:43:59,738 --> 00:44:00,571
- And I don't usually
eat red meat so.

561
00:44:00,572 --> 00:44:02,007
- What do you, a vegan?

562
00:44:02,841 --> 00:44:04,121
- No, I'm obviously eating meat.

563
00:44:06,177 --> 00:44:08,179
- I don't know.

564
00:44:10,949 --> 00:44:12,082
You never know
what the west coast

565
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:13,450
can do to a person
with all the pinko lefties

566
00:44:13,451 --> 00:44:15,291
running around with
their braided arm pit hair,

567
00:44:15,921 --> 00:44:17,464
afraid to eat the honey
from the bees, you know.

568
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,157
- No, I don't know.

569
00:44:20,458 --> 00:44:22,138
- Okay, children, less
politics, more wine.

570
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:24,896
Gray, do we have
any more of that stuff

571
00:44:26,698 --> 00:44:27,698
that Dougie made, downstairs?

572
00:44:27,699 --> 00:44:29,400
- No, I don't think so.

573
00:44:30,836 --> 00:44:31,803
- [Marine] Frankie, you
want another glass, right?

574
00:44:31,804 --> 00:44:33,044
- Uh, actually.
- Yeah, you want

575
00:44:33,471 --> 00:44:34,239
another one, okay.

576
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:35,239
(Chuckles)

577
00:44:35,774 --> 00:44:37,408
- She's great.

578
00:44:39,978 --> 00:44:41,498
- Yeah, yeah, she
can really get going.

579
00:44:43,281 --> 00:44:44,881
- So what are you
gonna do with the farm?

580
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,355
- I don't know, I might sell it.

581
00:44:54,292 --> 00:44:56,172
Could use the capital,
get some skin in the game

582
00:44:57,328 --> 00:45:00,331
for that new facility
going up, you know.

583
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:02,433
- You should do that.

584
00:45:03,068 --> 00:45:04,068
- Yeah.

585
00:45:05,771 --> 00:45:07,171
So you gonna tell
me the real reason

586
00:45:07,939 --> 00:45:09,019
that you came back or what?

587
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:14,880
- I don't know, to see you.

588
00:45:16,081 --> 00:45:17,881
- Just seems odd, I
haven't seen you in years.

589
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:20,886
We never talk.

590
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:22,980
We don't have a relationship.

591
00:45:24,355 --> 00:45:25,395
- No, I know how it seems.

592
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:27,125
- It seems odd.

593
00:45:30,428 --> 00:45:34,132
- So you're still doing
the acting thing, eh?

594
00:45:34,966 --> 00:45:37,268
- Yeah, I'm chipping away at it.

595
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:40,038
- That is so cool.

596
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:43,420
Hey, you should
talk to my niece.

597
00:45:46,211 --> 00:45:47,811
She's been doin' a
lotta like short films

598
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,381
and stuff back out east
with acting, you know.

599
00:45:53,018 --> 00:45:55,787
Really wants to make it big.

600
00:45:56,454 --> 00:45:59,323
- Yeah, sure.

601
00:45:59,324 --> 00:46:00,802
- [Marnie] You
tell her all the tricks

602
00:46:00,826 --> 00:46:02,027
of the trade, you know?

603
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:03,795
Like shortcuts.

604
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:06,250
- Yeah, right,
shortcuts. (Laughs)

605
00:46:06,932 --> 00:46:09,334
- I wish we'd seen more of ya.

606
00:46:11,569 --> 00:46:13,404
I like this, ya know.

607
00:46:13,872 --> 00:46:15,273
- Yeah.

608
00:46:17,475 --> 00:46:18,475
- It's great.

609
00:46:18,977 --> 00:46:19,977
- [Grayson] Marn, hun!

610
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,148
This kid's bein' a dick.

611
00:46:23,915 --> 00:46:25,050
- Okay, I'm comin'.

612
00:46:28,854 --> 00:46:32,423
These men, I tell ya.

613
00:46:33,424 --> 00:46:34,424
(Laughing)

614
00:46:37,695 --> 00:46:38,695
Be right back.

615
00:46:38,696 --> 00:46:39,696
(Fire crackling)

616
00:46:59,417 --> 00:47:03,021
- So I went to the
house last night.

617
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:06,057
- Oh?

618
00:47:08,927 --> 00:47:10,367
- Yeah, I wanted
to see if I could...

619
00:47:10,929 --> 00:47:12,609
You know, if I did
remember the way it was.

620
00:47:15,433 --> 00:47:19,004
- And?

621
00:47:20,972 --> 00:47:22,252
- There's a lot
of shit in there.

622
00:47:22,607 --> 00:47:23,909
(Laughing)

623
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:25,342
- Yeah.

624
00:47:26,644 --> 00:47:28,644
Yeah, I'm not looking
forward to dealing with that.

625
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:32,621
- Hey, do you remember
anyone with the name Bennett,

626
00:47:34,953 --> 00:47:38,423
last name Bennett?

627
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:40,370
- Doesn't ring a bell, why?

628
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,573
- I just, I was, I thought
I remembered someone,

629
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:49,000
my mom and dad's friends.

630
00:47:49,667 --> 00:47:51,136
- I doubt it.

631
00:47:53,972 --> 00:47:55,039
I know all of mom
and dad's friends.

632
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,975
- You sure about that?

633
00:47:57,608 --> 00:47:58,910
- Yeah, I am.

634
00:48:08,019 --> 00:48:11,589
- Since when do you not drink?

635
00:48:12,657 --> 00:48:14,292
- Since the kid was born.

636
00:48:15,927 --> 00:48:17,462
Yeah.

637
00:48:20,365 --> 00:48:21,365
Yeah, it's good, I guess.

638
00:48:23,134 --> 00:48:25,054
It was just startin' to
get in the way of things.

639
00:48:27,172 --> 00:48:28,172
- It sure did for dad.

640
00:48:31,776 --> 00:48:33,056
- What is that supposed to mean?

641
00:48:36,381 --> 00:48:38,621
- I'm just saying, dad didn't
make the greatest decisions

642
00:48:40,618 --> 00:48:43,354
when he was drinking.

643
00:48:43,821 --> 00:48:45,323
(Laughs)

644
00:48:48,093 --> 00:48:49,527
- Why are you doin' this?

645
00:48:50,195 --> 00:48:51,929
- What, what?

646
00:48:53,598 --> 00:48:55,199
- You just come
back to shit on him or?

647
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,068
'Cause you were a screw up.

648
00:48:57,835 --> 00:48:59,604
- No, I was just...

649
00:49:01,339 --> 00:49:01,906
- Just being disrespectful
because that's nothin' new.

650
00:49:01,907 --> 00:49:05,476
- Excuse me?

651
00:49:06,644 --> 00:49:07,844
- You just think
you're so much better

652
00:49:07,845 --> 00:49:08,845
than everyone, Frankie.

653
00:49:09,914 --> 00:49:10,914
- I don't think I'm fucking
better than anyone, Grayson.

654
00:49:10,915 --> 00:49:13,618
- Frankie knows best.

655
00:49:15,186 --> 00:49:16,186
- Okay, I'm gonna go.

656
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:20,790
- That's a good idea.

657
00:49:21,392 --> 00:49:22,636
The best idea you've
had in a decade.

658
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:24,061
- Hey, fuck you!

659
00:49:24,062 --> 00:49:25,102
- Yeah, run away, Frankie.

660
00:49:26,597 --> 00:49:28,099
That's classic stuff.

661
00:49:34,939 --> 00:49:38,643
(Slow tempo rock music)

662
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:16,381
♪ yeah ♪

663
00:50:21,052 --> 00:50:22,052
♪ yeah ♪

664
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:40,538

(Water splashing)

667
00:51:37,828 --> 00:51:41,499
- All right, you guys
have to really do it there.

668
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:43,593
What you're gonna have to do,

669
00:51:44,335 --> 00:51:45,869
you're using here
'cause it's gonna

670
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:47,137
have a direct correlation
to how this piston functions.

671
00:51:47,138 --> 00:51:50,107
So all that
information should be

672
00:51:51,008 --> 00:51:52,088
in page 22 of your manuals.

673
00:51:52,243 --> 00:51:54,245
(Knocking)

674
00:51:54,979 --> 00:51:56,480
Make sure you, uh.

675
00:51:56,481 --> 00:51:58,521
Make sure you read that
clearly because that's gonna

676
00:51:59,684 --> 00:52:01,244
help you understand
this entire machine.

677
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:04,255
(Students chattering)

678
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:07,570
Frankie Bingley, did not
expect to see you here.

679
00:52:10,228 --> 00:52:12,663
- Yeah, well, here I am.

680
00:52:13,664 --> 00:52:14,665
- So what's?

681
00:52:17,835 --> 00:52:18,835
What's going on?

682
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:21,805
(Chuckles)

683
00:52:25,109 --> 00:52:26,176
- I kinda need a favor.

684
00:52:26,177 --> 00:52:27,278
- Okay, what do you need?

685
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,440
- If I tell you, you're
not gonna wanna do it

686
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:32,889
so will you meet me after work?

687
00:52:33,017 --> 00:52:35,653
Bankview motel?

688
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:37,154
- Okay.

689
00:52:38,055 --> 00:52:39,175
Do I need to bring anything?

690
00:52:40,691 --> 00:52:41,691
- Just yourself.

691
00:52:44,529 --> 00:52:48,266
- You're an odd
one, Frankie Bingley.

692
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,569
- No, king, Frankie king.

693
00:52:52,303 --> 00:52:53,804
I changed my name.

694
00:52:54,372 --> 00:52:55,406
(Chuckles)

695
00:52:58,709 --> 00:53:00,389
- [Grayson] Hey,
Frankie, I just wanted to,

696
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:07,196
I didn't mean to make
you upset last night.

697
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:12,657
I've just been a little
outta sorts lately and, uh.

698
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:16,494
(Queen Berry laughing on TV)

699
00:53:17,662 --> 00:53:18,496
Anyhow, we're all gonna
be at the house tomorrow

700
00:53:18,497 --> 00:53:20,665
so come on by if you want.

701
00:53:21,232 --> 00:53:22,867
Okay, bye.

702
00:53:26,404 --> 00:53:27,972
- [Bruce] So like
this way or this way?

703
00:53:29,106 --> 00:53:30,116
- Horizontal, it looks better.

704
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:31,576
- Okay.

705
00:53:32,443 --> 00:53:33,443
- Bruce, can you hear me?

706
00:53:34,479 --> 00:53:35,556
- Yeah, it's comin'
through good.

707
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:36,381
- Can you hear me, Bruce?

708
00:53:36,382 --> 00:53:37,914
- Yup, still hear you.

709
00:53:37,915 --> 00:53:39,595
- To record just press
the round red button

710
00:53:40,685 --> 00:53:41,965
at the bar.
- Thanks, I've used a

711
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:43,787
cell phone before.

712
00:53:43,788 --> 00:53:45,154
- Okay, sorry, my brother
still has a flip phone.

713
00:53:45,155 --> 00:53:47,858
- [Bruce] All right,
ready when you are.

714
00:53:50,595 --> 00:53:51,875
- Frankie king
with Blaze talent.

715
00:53:55,533 --> 00:53:57,173
I'm 5'9 and reading
for the role of Livia.

716
00:54:01,138 --> 00:54:04,742
So how'd you find me?

717
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:07,077
- [Bruce] It wasn't
hard, he's a terrible liar.

718
00:54:07,078 --> 00:54:09,380
- Yeah, I guess.

719
00:54:10,281 --> 00:54:11,615
Your whole marriage is a lie.

720
00:54:11,616 --> 00:54:13,551
- You think he
actually loves you?

721
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:15,553
He doesn't love you.

722
00:54:16,721 --> 00:54:17,998
- He's planning on
leaving you, Terry.

723
00:54:18,022 --> 00:54:19,824
It's over.

724
00:54:20,658 --> 00:54:21,658
Believe what you want.

725
00:54:24,629 --> 00:54:26,629
You think he's playing
soccer every Thursday night?

726
00:54:26,731 --> 00:54:30,967
No.

727
00:54:30,968 --> 00:54:32,448
He's making love to
me every Thursday.

728
00:54:32,837 --> 00:54:34,605
(Inhaling)

729
00:54:37,141 --> 00:54:38,042
That's icky, okay, cut.

730
00:54:38,043 --> 00:54:39,577
Okay, I think we got it.

731
00:54:40,244 --> 00:54:41,478
- That's it?

732
00:54:41,479 --> 00:54:42,746
- Yeah, it's easy, right?

733
00:54:42,747 --> 00:54:43,980
- You don't wanna
do another one?

734
00:54:43,981 --> 00:54:45,616
- Do you think I
should do another one?

735
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:49,285
- Well, I mean, there
was a bump in the middle.

736
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:50,726
I feel like I can
do it a bit better.

737
00:54:50,755 --> 00:54:52,357
- You think you
can do a little better?

738
00:54:53,057 --> 00:54:54,057
- Yeah, if we can.

739
00:54:54,459 --> 00:54:55,459
- Okay, you got it.

740
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:57,794
- All right.

741
00:54:57,795 --> 00:54:58,563
- From the top.

742
00:54:58,563 --> 00:54:59,563
(Frankie clears throat)

743
00:55:02,867 --> 00:55:04,133
- [Announcer] Remember
friends, I want you to hang around.

744
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,569
Coming up in the second
half, the toughest eight seconds

745
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:07,605
on earth right here in bankview.

746
00:55:08,773 --> 00:55:10,093
We're glad you're
with us on this,

747
00:55:11,108 --> 00:55:13,228
another fabulous rodeo
weekend right here in bankview.

748
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:17,047
(People chattering)

749
00:55:20,551 --> 00:55:22,085
- [Frankie voiceover] I
never woulda thought

750
00:55:22,086 --> 00:55:22,787
in a million years I'd end
up at a rodeo in bankview

751
00:55:22,788 --> 00:55:24,722
with my high school boyfriend.

752
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:27,758
- [Bruce voiceover] Never?

753
00:55:29,126 --> 00:55:30,860
- [Frankie voiceover]
No never, ever, ever.

754
00:55:30,861 --> 00:55:34,764
It fucking reeks in
here like animal shit.

755
00:55:34,765 --> 00:55:37,602
- [Bruce] Well, I don't
smell a thing, city girl.

756
00:55:38,469 --> 00:55:40,605
- So you never got married?

757
00:55:41,706 --> 00:55:43,106
- No, I got close
a couple times but

758
00:55:44,041 --> 00:55:46,043
just didn't feel right.

759
00:55:48,513 --> 00:55:49,747
I take it neither did you?

760
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:53,984
- Well, I am actually.

761
00:55:55,386 --> 00:55:56,754
- Oh.

762
00:55:58,956 --> 00:56:00,089
- Yeah, I've been
meaning to tell you.

763
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:02,427
- Ah ha, fuckin' actor.

764
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:06,130
(Frankie laughs)

765
00:56:07,598 --> 00:56:09,358
- No, I don't think it's
in the cards for me.

766
00:56:12,403 --> 00:56:15,973
- [Announcer] Well, bayview,
another great rodeo ride.

767
00:56:17,442 --> 00:56:19,443
Now it's time to go
to shoot number four

768
00:56:19,444 --> 00:56:21,221
as we get ready for one
of the top bronc riders

769
00:56:21,245 --> 00:56:22,880
we have in our game.

770
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:25,582
He's gonna measure
that bronc rein

771
00:56:25,583 --> 00:56:26,916
all the way back to
the front of the saddle.

772
00:56:26,917 --> 00:56:28,197
After that, we're
gonna come out.

773
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:29,665
He nods his head and away we go!

774
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:32,022
(Upbeat country music)

775
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:35,526
How about that, bankview?

776
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:38,674
Another great saddle bronc ride.

777
00:56:40,465 --> 00:56:44,134
As we call in the
pick up men to rein in

778
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,504
that beautiful palomino pony,

779
00:56:48,072 --> 00:56:49,439
another one of the four-legged
superstars from our game.

780
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,876
This should be a bunch of fun

781
00:56:52,943 --> 00:56:53,678
as we get ready
to ride another one.

782
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:56,013
(People chattering)

783
00:56:57,515 --> 00:56:58,449
- I work with a donkey
on the kid's show.

784
00:56:58,450 --> 00:57:00,618
It's got nothin' on these.

785
00:57:01,285 --> 00:57:02,285
(Bruce laughs)

786
00:57:02,987 --> 00:57:04,889
This is fun.

787
00:57:05,623 --> 00:57:06,623
- [Bruce] Thank god.

788
00:57:08,626 --> 00:57:09,759
- [Frankie voiceover]
Okay, don't get me wrong.

789
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,160
This is a really country
experience, but it's kinda fun.

790
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:14,031
- [Bruce voiceover] Well,
you're country, Frankie.

791
00:57:15,232 --> 00:57:16,601
Down those guts.

792
00:57:17,468 --> 00:57:18,748
- [Frankie voiceover] So, I, uh.

793
00:57:21,539 --> 00:57:23,299
I think I just find out
that I have a sister.

794
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:28,078
- [Bruce voiceover] Oh?

795
00:57:31,215 --> 00:57:32,049
- [Frankie voiceover]
Yeah, I don't know.

796
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:34,752
- Whoa, how's that?

797
00:57:35,385 --> 00:57:36,587
- My dad.

798
00:57:39,557 --> 00:57:41,077
It was a secret he
didn't tell anybody.

799
00:57:42,593 --> 00:57:44,033
I don't know, part
of me's interested

800
00:57:46,731 --> 00:57:48,533
in this girl, you know?

801
00:57:49,433 --> 00:57:50,501
- Wow.

802
00:57:55,072 --> 00:57:55,606
You share blood,
that's the thing.

803
00:57:55,607 --> 00:57:57,942
It's undeniable.

804
00:58:01,078 --> 00:58:04,782
- Yeah.

805
00:58:05,382 --> 00:58:06,382
Yeah, it is.

806
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:09,418
(Gentle country music)

807
00:58:25,536 --> 00:58:29,239
(Train horns blowing distantly)

808
00:58:49,594 --> 00:58:53,297
(Motor humming)

809
00:58:54,164 --> 00:58:55,164
- Here we go.

810
00:58:58,468 --> 00:59:02,106
- Thank you, that was more
fun than I thought it would be.

811
00:59:02,707 --> 00:59:05,009
(Bruce chuckles)

812
00:59:05,910 --> 00:59:07,712
- Well, that's a great review.

813
00:59:08,846 --> 00:59:10,290
- You know I didn't
mean it like that.

814
00:59:10,314 --> 00:59:12,082
- I know.

815
00:59:21,592 --> 00:59:25,195
- Hey, um.

816
00:59:27,464 --> 00:59:31,135
I'm sorry about the way
that things ended between us.

817
00:59:36,974 --> 00:59:40,210
- You got nothing to
be sorry about, Frankie.

818
00:59:51,521 --> 00:59:55,192
- Are you coming to the funeral?

819
00:59:55,826 --> 00:59:58,062
- I'll be there.

820
01:00:09,273 --> 01:00:12,977
(Motor humming)

821
01:00:21,786 --> 01:00:25,690
(Motor humming)

822
01:00:26,791 --> 01:00:27,957
- Hey, did that make
you dick bigger?

823
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:29,393
I'm speeding, you
fucking asshole!

824
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,830
(Phone buzzing)

825
01:00:33,497 --> 01:00:35,700
Hey, penny.

826
01:00:36,934 --> 01:00:37,802
- [Penny] Frankie,
how are you doing?

827
01:00:37,803 --> 01:00:42,038
- I'm okay, getting by.

828
01:00:42,039 --> 01:00:43,539
- [Penny] Thanks for sending
that self tape for the soap.

829
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:44,785
- The script was
fucking terrible.

830
01:00:44,809 --> 01:00:46,376
- [Penny] Yeah.

831
01:00:47,778 --> 01:00:48,578
Hey, look, I have the
Berry producers on my ass.

832
01:00:48,579 --> 01:00:50,981
- Yeah, I talked to Kim.

833
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:53,589
- [Penny] They're
being unreasonable.

834
01:00:54,384 --> 01:00:55,551
I'm trying to tell them both
her parents fucking died.

835
01:00:55,552 --> 01:00:57,432
That's why you have
production insurance, hello.

836
01:00:57,688 --> 01:00:59,724
- Yeah, that'd be nice.

837
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:01,290
- [Penny] Well.

838
01:01:02,626 --> 01:01:04,093
I negotiated and
got you until Monday.

839
01:01:04,094 --> 01:01:06,230
- I don't think I
give a fuck, penny.

840
01:01:06,964 --> 01:01:08,699
- [Penny] Frankie.

841
01:01:09,934 --> 01:01:11,000
- I don't wanna go
back to that shitty set.

842
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:12,441
- [Penny] We can
talk about this more

843
01:01:13,137 --> 01:01:13,437
when you get back
on Monday, 'Kay?

844
01:01:13,438 --> 01:01:15,973
Monday?

845
01:01:16,473 --> 01:01:17,473
Frankie?

846
01:01:20,878 --> 01:01:21,878
Finish the season out.

847
01:01:23,213 --> 01:01:24,281
- Yeah, yeah.

848
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:27,016
- [Penny] All right, hun.

849
01:01:27,484 --> 01:01:28,484
Safe travels.

850
01:01:29,253 --> 01:01:30,319

Can I help you?

858
01:02:07,457 --> 01:02:08,977
- I'm Frankie Bingley,
iain's daughter.

859
01:02:12,797 --> 01:02:16,233
- Yeah, uh.

860
01:02:18,268 --> 01:02:19,268
I'm not sure who
you're talking about.

861
01:02:19,269 --> 01:02:21,471
I'm sorry.
- He's dead.

862

Can we talk?

- I'm not quite sure
why you're here, Frankie.

864
01:02:40,624 --> 01:02:42,960
- I have a half-sister.

865
01:02:45,695 --> 01:02:46,695
- Yeah.

866
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,100
How'd you find me?

867
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:55,351
- I found the money orders.

868
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,327
- Well, I was young
and I made a mistake so.

869
01:03:02,312 --> 01:03:04,248
- I am not here to judge you.

870
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,050
- No?

871
01:03:06,984 --> 01:03:08,144
What are you doing here then?

872
01:03:11,355 --> 01:03:14,859
Okay, you know
what, I can't do this.

873
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:17,646
- I'm sorry, I never
shoulda come here.

874
01:03:20,497 --> 01:03:24,168
- Wait.

875
01:03:24,701 --> 01:03:25,701
Wait.

876
01:03:29,106 --> 01:03:32,910
Do you want some coffee?

877
01:03:34,011 --> 01:03:35,331
We met at a
convention in Montana.

878
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:37,900
I was working for a
wind power company.

879
01:03:38,048 --> 01:03:40,184
You know, these conventions.

880
01:03:41,285 --> 01:03:42,605
A lotta parties,
a lotta drinking.

881
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:46,290
And we were at the same hotel.

882
01:03:47,191 --> 01:03:49,559
He was really easy to talk to.

883
01:03:50,895 --> 01:03:52,375
And I remember
when he smiled at me I,

884
01:03:55,499 --> 01:03:57,601
I felt like it was
genuine, it was warm.

885
01:04:00,037 --> 01:04:01,317
I was pretty lonely at the time.

886
01:04:04,774 --> 01:04:07,044
My parents lived back east.

887
01:04:10,214 --> 01:04:13,183
- Did you know he was married?

888
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:21,291
- We never talked about that.

889
01:04:23,527 --> 01:04:25,447
Anyway, he wanted to
cut ties and I was pregnant.

890
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:31,368
- I'm sorry.

891
01:04:34,471 --> 01:04:35,471
- No, don't be.

892
01:04:37,107 --> 01:04:38,267
It's not your fault. (Laughs)

893
01:04:38,976 --> 01:04:41,445
Yeah, I've spent a lot of time

894
01:04:42,646 --> 01:04:43,080
with a lotta shitty
men in my life.

895
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:44,080
(Laughing)

896
01:04:44,681 --> 01:04:46,150
- What'd you tell Julia?

897
01:04:49,653 --> 01:04:51,573
- I told her that I got
drunk and I got pregnant.

898
01:04:52,622 --> 01:04:55,392
And that her father wanted
nothing to do with her.

899
01:04:57,827 --> 01:04:59,596
- That's sad.

900
01:05:02,666 --> 01:05:04,146
- I mean, I have a
beautiful daughter.

901
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:07,972
Healthy.

902
01:05:08,705 --> 01:05:09,705
And we trust each other.

903
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:20,317
- I didn't know my parents.

904
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:24,239
I wasn't into the
farm or the church or

905
01:05:27,124 --> 01:05:29,559
the things my family were into.

906
01:05:31,861 --> 01:05:33,630
I liked boys and sex and music.

907
01:05:40,237 --> 01:05:43,707
I cut them out and
they cut me out.

908
01:05:47,344 --> 01:05:50,981
But now.

909
01:05:54,551 --> 01:05:58,222
I'm really not here to
fuck anything up for you

910
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:00,324
or your daughter.

911
01:06:03,427 --> 01:06:07,064
I just wanted to let
you know that Julia

912
01:06:08,332 --> 01:06:10,734
is named as beneficiary
on a half a million dollar

913
01:06:11,701 --> 01:06:14,204
life insurance policy.

914
01:06:15,005 --> 01:06:16,106
- Wha?

915
01:06:23,013 --> 01:06:26,616
- You didn't know?

916
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:34,324
Yeah, well, it's all there.

917
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:50,374
- Thank you, Frankie.

918
01:07:05,255 --> 01:07:09,059
(Soft country music)

919
01:07:27,277 --> 01:07:31,148
(Espresso machine humming)

920
01:07:51,735 --> 01:07:55,339
- Frankie?

921
01:08:05,149 --> 01:08:08,718
(Doorbell chiming)

922
01:08:14,424 --> 01:08:18,228
(Soft country music)

923
01:08:36,646 --> 01:08:40,250
(Sniffling)

924
01:09:17,086 --> 01:09:20,690
- Hey.

925
01:09:21,225 --> 01:09:22,225
- Hi.

926
01:09:23,693 --> 01:09:25,027
- [Grayson] You're here
to give us a hand or?

927
01:09:25,028 --> 01:09:26,930
- What, you're not done yet?

928
01:09:27,897 --> 01:09:28,897
- [Grayson] Yeah.

929
01:09:32,736 --> 01:09:36,306
(Gentle music)

930
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:52,589
(Jude mutters)

931
01:09:53,723 --> 01:09:55,203
- [Marnie] In the
grass or in the air.

932
01:09:55,392 --> 01:09:57,561
- Wanna do this
throw, count of three?

933
01:09:58,728 --> 01:10:00,196
One, two, three,
whoa, nice throw!

934
01:10:00,764 --> 01:10:02,899
Okay, high five.

935
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:13,677
- Once we get to
the bottom there,

936
01:10:14,611 --> 01:10:15,111
can I give this to you, honey?

937
01:10:15,112 --> 01:10:16,613
- Yeah.

938
01:10:17,714 --> 01:10:19,549
- Oh shit!
- Watch your foot.

939
01:10:20,317 --> 01:10:22,652
You got it now?
- What?

940
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:24,800
- You got it now?
- Kind of.

941
01:10:30,394 --> 01:10:33,863
Hey, I'm sorry
about running away

942
01:10:35,198 --> 01:10:36,766
without saying
goodbye the other night.

943
01:10:38,902 --> 01:10:40,622
- Lady, don't even
worry about it, I get it.

944
01:10:40,937 --> 01:10:44,408
I'm married to him.

945
01:10:44,974 --> 01:10:46,009
(Laughing)

946
01:10:48,011 --> 01:10:49,646
- It's not him.

947
01:10:56,786 --> 01:11:00,457
- You know I've
got five siblings.

948
01:11:01,291 --> 01:11:02,959
- Oh my god.
- Yeah.

949
01:11:04,227 --> 01:11:05,267
- Do y'all get along?
- No.

950
01:11:05,862 --> 01:11:06,862
No, no, no, no. (Laughs)

951
01:11:07,364 --> 01:11:09,699
That's family though.

952
01:11:11,635 --> 01:11:12,802
- Do you keep in touch?

953
01:11:15,872 --> 01:11:16,872
- When we can.

954
01:11:18,174 --> 01:11:19,894
I mean, I've got nine
nieces and nephews so.

955
01:11:20,877 --> 01:11:23,413
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

956
01:11:24,614 --> 01:11:26,316
- (Laughs) That would
be insane hard work.

957
01:11:29,152 --> 01:11:30,663
- It is, yeah, it is.
- Keeping track of them all.

958
01:11:30,687 --> 01:11:32,456
- It is hard work. (Laughs)

959
01:11:33,357 --> 01:11:36,292
But it's good work, you know?

960
01:11:37,761 --> 01:11:39,563
In the end.

961
01:11:52,476 --> 01:11:56,312
(Jude squealing)

962
01:11:57,514 --> 01:11:58,982
(Gentle music)

963
01:12:01,851 --> 01:12:02,851
(Laughing)

964
01:12:03,753 --> 01:12:04,421
- [Man] It's just
a matter of time.

965
01:12:04,421 --> 01:12:05,421
(Guests chattering)

966
01:12:06,490 --> 01:12:07,823
- I know that.
- At least the kids know.

967
01:12:07,824 --> 01:12:09,057
- [Marnie] Jude, honey,
why don't you come and sit.

968
01:12:09,058 --> 01:12:10,058
Thank you, honey.

969
01:12:10,694 --> 01:12:11,694
- [Man] Ooh, thank you.

970
01:12:14,864 --> 01:12:15,699
- Do want a hot dog or do
you just want your apple?

971
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:17,000
- I just want a hot dog.

972
01:12:17,767 --> 01:12:18,968
- Hot dog?

973
01:12:19,703 --> 01:12:21,069
(Family chattering)

974
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:23,238
What do you want, do you
want ketchup or mustard?

975
01:12:23,239 --> 01:12:25,040
- Start 'em young here.
- Probably should get it done.

976
01:12:25,041 --> 01:12:26,786
- When are you gonna
start moving, around six?

977
01:12:26,810 --> 01:12:28,290
- I'm just gonna
chill as soon as Doug

978
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:30,779
can hand me something.
- He's been doing everything,

979
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:32,425
absolutely everything.
- Not the only person

980
01:12:32,449 --> 01:12:33,316
in this family who lies.

981
01:12:33,316 --> 01:12:34,316
(Laughing)

982
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:36,119
- [Frankie] Oh, snap.

983
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:38,420
- [Marnie] Bad joke, bad joke.

984
01:12:38,555 --> 01:12:39,555
- Oh, well said.

985
01:12:40,223 --> 01:12:41,223
- [Marnie] Too soon.

986
01:12:41,591 --> 01:12:42,591
(People chattering)

987
01:12:43,326 --> 01:12:45,462
- This is gonna take years.

988
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:49,717
- Makes me wish I
never owned anything.

989
01:12:50,033 --> 01:12:51,968
- I'm goin' home
right after this,

990
01:12:53,169 --> 01:12:54,770
and I'm throwin' out
everything in my basement.

991
01:12:54,771 --> 01:12:56,971
Yeah, it's just gonna be
someone else's problem one day.

992
01:13:04,714 --> 01:13:08,552
I remember buying this
for dad, for father's day.

993
01:13:14,157 --> 01:13:16,826
I was like 11 or 12, and
this was the first gift I ever

994
01:13:19,796 --> 01:13:21,598
bought him with my own money.

995
01:13:24,968 --> 01:13:26,808
We spent like half an
hour in the thrift store,

996
01:13:29,105 --> 01:13:30,674
and this is what I picked.

997
01:13:32,976 --> 01:13:35,296
I don't think I ever saw dad
where a tie a day in his life,

998
01:13:37,814 --> 01:13:40,750
but I thought he'd
really like this.

999
01:13:42,552 --> 01:13:43,912
I thought I got a
really good gift.

1000
01:13:54,330 --> 01:13:57,867
Still in the box.

1001
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:04,040
Adios, dad.

1002
01:14:11,214 --> 01:14:14,784
(Gentle music)

1003
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:42,946
- We are gathered here
today to celebrate the lives

1004
01:14:43,813 --> 01:14:45,048
of Anna and iain Bingley.

1005
01:14:46,516 --> 01:14:48,036
And the unexpected
loss of a loved one,

1006
01:14:48,885 --> 01:14:51,487
a neighbor, a friend.

1007
01:14:52,989 --> 01:14:55,149
Well, it brings us face to
face with our own mortality,

1008
01:14:55,258 --> 01:14:57,193
how fleeting life can be.

1009
01:14:58,327 --> 01:14:59,529
And when cut short by tragedy,

1010
01:15:01,831 --> 01:15:03,391
we are left with how
to grapple with how

1011
01:15:03,767 --> 01:15:05,635
to make sense of it all.

1012
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:08,037
And we may shake our fist at god

1013
01:15:09,172 --> 01:15:10,807
or bow our heads
in defeat and despair.

1014
01:15:13,276 --> 01:15:15,178
But, brothers and
sisters, as the apostle Paul

1015
01:15:18,214 --> 01:15:22,718
wrote in the epistle
of the thessalonians.

1016
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:25,054
We do not want
you to be uninformed

1017
01:15:27,323 --> 01:15:28,524
about those who sleep in death

1018
01:15:29,659 --> 01:15:31,628
so that you do not
grieve like the rest

1019
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:33,697
of mankind who have no hope.

1020
01:15:35,098 --> 01:15:36,898
For we believe that
Jesus died and Rose again,

1021
01:15:39,068 --> 01:15:41,671
and so we believe
that god will bring

1022
01:15:43,139 --> 01:15:44,979
with Jesus those who
have fallen asleep in him.

1023
01:15:47,276 --> 01:15:48,276
So.

1024
01:15:51,715 --> 01:15:52,835
Anna and iain are now safely

1025
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:57,952
in the loving
embrace of our savior.

1026
01:16:01,324 --> 01:16:03,226
Let us bow our heads.

1027
01:16:06,429 --> 01:16:08,429
Our father who art in
heaven, hallowed be thy name,

1028
01:16:09,999 --> 01:16:12,902
thy kingdom come,
thy will be done

1029
01:16:13,770 --> 01:16:16,172
on earth as it is in heaven.

1030
01:16:17,707 --> 01:16:19,467
- I just want to thank
all of you for coming.

1031
01:16:25,081 --> 01:16:28,117
I know that mom and dad
are looking down on us and

1032
01:16:33,990 --> 01:16:36,225
Mom's probably saying how
much she likes the flowers so.

1033
01:16:39,062 --> 01:16:41,030
And, uh.

1034
01:16:43,566 --> 01:16:44,566
Excuse me.

1035
01:17:01,217 --> 01:17:04,788
- I think what my
brother is trying to say is

1036
01:17:06,155 --> 01:17:09,058
it means the world to us
that all of you are here today,

1037
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:12,696
to our family.

1038
01:17:16,866 --> 01:17:20,336
Most of you don't know
me very well anymore.

1039
01:17:21,437 --> 01:17:24,674
I follow scripts for a living,

1040
01:17:25,842 --> 01:17:26,642
and I really wish I had
one right now. (Laughs)

1041
01:17:26,643 --> 01:17:30,213
But I don't.

1042
01:17:32,816 --> 01:17:36,319
It's really nice to
see all your faces.

1043
01:17:39,555 --> 01:17:40,555
Are you good?

1044
01:17:43,559 --> 01:17:44,928
- Yeah.

1045
01:17:46,696 --> 01:17:49,933
Oh, thank you and god bless.

1046
01:17:52,969 --> 01:17:56,339
(Mourners chattering)

1047
01:17:57,173 --> 01:18:00,109
(Gentle music)

1048
01:18:48,591 --> 01:18:52,295
So, uh.

1049
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:56,264
We're actually having some
people around the house

1050
01:18:56,265 --> 01:18:58,301
in a little bit if
you wanna come.

1051
01:19:01,037 --> 01:19:02,517
- I actually have
to go unfortunately.

1052
01:19:05,674 --> 01:19:08,011
- Yeah, yeah, okay.

1053
01:19:11,815 --> 01:19:15,484
Well, don't be a stranger.

1054
01:19:18,354 --> 01:19:21,524
- I won't.

1055
01:19:26,963 --> 01:19:30,766
(Somber music)

1056
01:20:25,054 --> 01:20:28,557
(Water splashing)

1057
01:20:42,038 --> 01:20:45,541
(Water splashing)

1058
01:20:49,712 --> 01:20:53,182
(Toilet flushing)

1059
01:21:10,533 --> 01:21:14,137
(Gentle music)

1060
01:21:32,956 --> 01:21:36,459
(Water splashing)

1061
01:22:02,551 --> 01:22:06,022
(Crew chattering)

1062
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:25,308
- [Assistant director]
All right, everyone,

1063
01:22:26,042 --> 01:22:27,042
let's get her up.

1064
01:22:35,618 --> 01:22:39,288
