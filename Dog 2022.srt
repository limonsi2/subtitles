-Sure.

Lettuce, tomato?

10
00:03:40,089 --> 00:03:42,265
Uh, let me get some
lettuce, tomato,

11
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:43,832
and let me get
some of those peppers.

Done.

14

Yo, are you high?

15
00:03:51,753 --> 00:03:53,494
I said peppers,
not cucumbers.

16
00:03:54,843 --> 00:03:57,715
Sorry, sir, my bad.

17
00:03:59,195 --> 00:04:00,283
Mayo, mustard?

18
00:04:00,327 --> 00:04:02,067
Uh, mayo, and, uh,

19
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:03,678
give me some of that
salt and pepper, buddy.

22
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:11,990
Hi, Dorith.
This is Jackson Briggs.

23
00:04:12,034 --> 00:04:13,340
I was just checking
on my status

24
00:04:13,383 --> 00:04:14,906
for the Pakistan rotation.

25
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,300
Um, just trying
to sort my travel.

26
00:04:17,344 --> 00:04:19,520
Mr. Briggs, you know the
agency can't send a soldier

27
00:04:19,563 --> 00:04:21,826
with a history of brain
injuries to a war zone.

28
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,481
No, no, I just got you guys
a full, clean medical.

29
00:04:24,525 --> 00:04:26,091
Yes, but we need

30
00:04:26,135 --> 00:04:28,442
your commanding officer
to certify that.

31
00:04:28,485 --> 00:04:30,444
Yeah, and I've told
the recruiter, like, 12 times.

32
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:31,923
You know these guys.

33
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:33,316
They're impossible
to reach on deployment.

34
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,709
But it's coming.
So let's just get

35
00:04:34,752 --> 00:04:36,232
the on-boarding process going

36
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,800
and, I don't know,
get my travel sorted.

37
00:04:38,843 --> 00:04:41,759
Mr. Briggs,
you know we can't do that.

38
00:04:41,803 --> 00:04:44,109
Look, I got other agencies
beating down my door,

39
00:04:44,153 --> 00:04:45,110
so, look...

40
00:04:46,764 --> 00:04:50,420
So, look, I can't wait till
next year's rotation, okay?

41
00:04:50,464 --> 00:04:52,335
And we can't staff you
without that recommendation.

42
00:04:53,945 --> 00:04:57,297
Okay, uh, when do I need
to have it by?

43
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,603
The rotation closes
next Wednesday.

44
00:05:00,517 --> 00:05:02,084
All right,
you'll hear from me.

45
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:26,326

-Hello.
-Briggs, this is Jones.

49
00:05:50,524 --> 00:05:52,264
Hey, Captain.

50
00:05:52,308 --> 00:05:53,614
Are you in the middle
of something?

51
00:05:53,657 --> 00:05:55,442
No, no, it's a good time.

52
00:05:55,485 --> 00:05:56,791
Yeah, no, I was calling about

53
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:58,358
that diplomatic
security application

54
00:05:58,401 --> 00:05:59,881
I was hoping you'd
help me with.

55
00:05:59,924 --> 00:06:01,535
Look, I'm calling
about Rodriguez.

56
00:06:01,578 --> 00:06:03,101
He passed away last night.

57
00:06:03,145 --> 00:06:04,276
Stop me
if you already heard this.

58
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:06,148
No.

59
00:06:08,455 --> 00:06:09,804
No, I didn't hear.

60
00:06:09,847 --> 00:06:11,458
I'm sorry, Briggs.

61
00:06:11,501 --> 00:06:12,763
We're all going
to Patton Barracks

62
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:13,764
to say goodbye to him.

63
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:16,985
-When?
-Tomorrow night.

64
00:06:19,117 --> 00:06:19,944
All right.

65
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,774
-Briggs?
-Yeah, I'll be there.

[man] Sergeant Rodriguez
was a legend

69
00:06:52,586 --> 00:06:53,630
who never quit.

70
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,853
He burned bright
and then he burned in.

71
00:07:00,942 --> 00:07:02,465
Airborne Ranger in the sky.

72
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:04,380
[all] Airborne Ranger
in the sky.

73
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,034
You can tell an Airborne
Ranger by his boots!

74
00:07:06,077 --> 00:07:07,818
[all] By his boots!

[sighs]

79
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:34,236
Just need you to call
and just be like, "He's good."

80
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,933
-No.
-That's it.

81
00:07:35,977 --> 00:07:37,457
-I'm trying to get some money.
-It's not happening.

82
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,806
I'm trying to get
some money, that's it.

83
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:40,372
-Not happening.
-[Briggs] 200K a year,

84
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:42,157
-that's all I want.
-[overlapping chatter]

85
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,767
Just, like,
make the call for me.

86
00:07:43,811 --> 00:07:45,073
Yeah, I wish I had that power,

87
00:07:45,116 --> 00:07:46,944
but your boy's
still an E-6, so...

88
00:07:46,988 --> 00:07:48,729
-[laughs]
-...that's not happening.

89
00:07:48,772 --> 00:07:50,295
I love him.
You shut your mouth.

90
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:51,775
You shut your mouth
when you talk about him.

91
00:07:53,777 --> 00:07:56,084
-[somber music playing]
-[chatter continues]

92
00:08:14,711 --> 00:08:15,799
Good luck, brother.

93
00:08:17,758 --> 00:08:19,890
[all] Taboo! Taboo!

94
00:08:19,934 --> 00:08:21,892
Get up, Kiernan. Come on.

95
00:08:21,936 --> 00:08:23,415
-Oh, no.
-You're pissing me off.

96
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:25,156
-Let's go.
-Come on. Hey, hey, hey.

97
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,680
-Up, up.
-Hey, hey, figure it out.

98
00:08:26,723 --> 00:08:27,898
Figure it out.

99
00:08:29,334 --> 00:08:31,119
Okay, Briggs, get on with it.

100
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:34,731
-What?
-You know what.

101
00:08:34,775 --> 00:08:36,385
Hey, you're the one who's
[chuckles]

102
00:08:36,428 --> 00:08:38,256
screening my calls
and ghosting my texts, sir.

103
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,388
Like, what's a girl
supposed to think?

104
00:08:39,431 --> 00:08:41,129
He's supposed to get the hint.

105
00:08:41,172 --> 00:08:42,696
"Hi, it's Captain Jones

106
00:08:42,739 --> 00:08:44,567
calling on behalf
of Staff Sergeant Briggs.

107
00:08:44,611 --> 00:08:45,916
He's a total badass,

108
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,439
he's squared away,
good to go."

109
00:08:47,483 --> 00:08:48,919
You made that call
for 50 other soldiers.

110
00:08:48,963 --> 00:08:50,268
Yeah, who haven't been flagged
for TBIs.

111
00:08:50,312 --> 00:08:51,400
Take it up with the doctors,
not me.

112
00:08:51,443 --> 00:08:52,575
Look, Bear's got half a hand.

113
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:54,142
You got a, like a chunk

114
00:08:54,185 --> 00:08:55,578
of shrapnel stuck
in your tramp stamp.

115
00:08:55,622 --> 00:08:57,275
Kiernan can barely remember
his name.

116
00:08:57,319 --> 00:08:58,973
-Shut your mouth.
-There's a hundred concussions

117
00:08:59,016 --> 00:09:01,018
walking around
this entire parking lot.

118
00:09:01,062 --> 00:09:02,542
-[Jones grunts]
-And it's not stopping y'all.

119
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:03,717
In, in.

120
00:09:04,631 --> 00:09:07,677
[sighs] Ours aren't on paper.

121
00:09:07,721 --> 00:09:10,201
Maybe check your email.
I got a full, clean medical.

122
00:09:10,245 --> 00:09:11,463
Yeah? How much
you pay for that?

123
00:09:11,507 --> 00:09:13,074
That's not the point.

124
00:09:13,117 --> 00:09:14,641
Sir, name it,
what do you want?

125
00:09:14,684 --> 00:09:15,990
Tell me what you want.

126
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:20,168
[sighs] I'm sorry,
get home safe.

127
00:09:20,211 --> 00:09:21,256
[Briggs] You're just gonna
get in... Okay.

128
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:22,649
You want me to get the...

129
00:09:22,692 --> 00:09:23,824
All right, I'm getting
the knee pads.

130
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:25,347
[engine starting]

131
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,957
I'm getting the knee pads,
sir. Come on.

132
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:28,306
Are you really just gonna
pull out right now?

133
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,743
Might as well
just get the strap

134
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:31,092
out of the center console
and put me down

135
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,441
if I can't get back
in the game,

136
00:09:32,484 --> 00:09:33,921
just go ahead
and end it for me.

137
00:09:33,964 --> 00:09:35,487
Just put me out of my misery,
it's fine.

138
00:09:35,531 --> 00:09:36,880
[Jones] Briggs, get home safe.
That's an order.

139
00:09:36,924 --> 00:09:39,448
Sir, where are you goin'? Sir!

140
00:09:40,536 --> 00:09:41,406
Sir!

141
00:09:48,022 --> 00:09:49,066
[car door opens]

142
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,467
Airborne!

143
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,077
[grunts]

144
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:02,297
Staff Sergeant Briggs
is a total badass, huh?

145
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,907
[laughing]

146
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:05,256
Oh, hey, Captain.

147
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,910
Figured I'd find you
still here.

148
00:10:06,954 --> 00:10:08,346
Get yourself together.

149
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,521
Come meet me
in Battalion in 30.

150
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,524
Does that mean
you're gonna make the call?

151
00:10:14,048 --> 00:10:16,050
Hey, Captain, all the guys
talk shit about you,

152
00:10:16,093 --> 00:10:17,486
but I always knew
you had a heart of gold,

153
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:19,009
and I was like,
"Not my captain.

154
00:10:19,836 --> 00:10:20,837
No."

-Howdy.

157
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,074
Thank you.

Oh, come on, man.

160

You know how many times
I've been in and out
of this gate with that?

Excuse me?

162
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,737
Okay, think about it.
What's the odds I'm ISIS?

163
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,479
Step out of the vehicle, sir.

164
00:10:54,523 --> 00:10:55,742
You want me to step out
of the vehicle...

165
00:10:55,785 --> 00:10:57,091
-Hey.
-...I'll happily...

166
00:10:57,134 --> 00:10:58,222
He's with
the Ranger battalion.

I'm sorry, what?

00:11:23,508 --> 00:11:25,206
[soldiers repeating]

178
00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:26,598
[officer] Surrender
is not a Ranger word.

179
00:11:26,642 --> 00:11:28,513
[soldiers repeating]

180
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:30,211
[officer] I'll never leave
a fallen comrade...

181
00:11:30,254 --> 00:11:31,778
What? Y'all gave away
my parking spot.

182
00:11:31,821 --> 00:11:33,518
I had to walk all the way
from the DFAC.

183
00:11:33,562 --> 00:11:35,085
-Keep pushing.
-Where are y'all headed?

184
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:37,479
We're wheels down in Syria
in 24 hours.

185
00:11:37,522 --> 00:11:39,437
C-17 is loading up
as we speak.

186
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:41,004
[Briggs] Look, sir,
I really appreciate this,

187
00:11:41,048 --> 00:11:42,484
I ain't gonna let you down.

188
00:11:42,527 --> 00:11:43,790
I've been working
the last three years

189
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:44,878
to get it straight
for this job.

190
00:11:44,921 --> 00:11:46,357
That's what I like to hear.

191
00:11:46,401 --> 00:11:47,794
Kennelo, what did I say about

192
00:11:47,837 --> 00:11:49,534
using your mom's weights?
Like...

193
00:11:49,578 --> 00:11:50,884
I'm trying to look good
for your mom.

194
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:52,581
Well, I'm just trying
to say, just...

195
00:11:52,624 --> 00:11:53,930
I don't know, more quads.

196
00:11:53,974 --> 00:11:55,323
Gonna give you a baby brother.

197
00:11:56,846 --> 00:11:58,761
So what do you gotta do?
Interview me or something

198
00:11:58,805 --> 00:12:00,937
to make sure I've got
a brain cell left, or...

199
00:12:00,981 --> 00:12:02,722
Yeah, something like that.

200
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:04,724
[chuckling] Well, you say,
"Jump," I say, "How high?"

201
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,378
Wait, isn't your office
this way?

202
00:12:07,422 --> 00:12:08,553
[Jones] Sure is.

203
00:12:12,035 --> 00:12:13,776
Riley's stuff
just about ready, Kiernan?

204
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,212
Just about, sir.

205
00:12:16,213 --> 00:12:17,214
You good, man?

206
00:12:18,476 --> 00:12:20,261
[sighs] Yeah, man.
It is what it is.

207
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:22,002
[Briggs] Yeah.

208
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:25,570
Riley was about as solid
as they come.

209
00:12:25,614 --> 00:12:27,485
Tell that to the tree
he hit doin' 120.

210
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:29,618
[Jones] All right, Kiernan,
let's go, come on.

211
00:12:32,012 --> 00:12:33,404
[Briggs] What's gonna
happen to his dog?

212
00:12:33,448 --> 00:12:35,189
Thought you'd never ask.

213
00:12:35,232 --> 00:12:37,017
Family funeral's Sunday
outside of Nogales.

214
00:12:38,061 --> 00:12:40,281
She's the guest of honor.

215
00:12:40,324 --> 00:12:42,457
Oh, that's...
That's a genius idea.

216
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,285
I hope she doesn't
eat everybody first.

217
00:12:44,328 --> 00:12:46,766
[chuckles softly]
Well, that part will be
up to you.

218
00:12:49,725 --> 00:12:51,161
Wait, wait, what?

219
00:12:51,205 --> 00:12:53,381
-[dogs barking]
-[man shouting indistinctly]

220
00:12:55,165 --> 00:12:57,080
[Jones] We sent Riley's body
off late last night.

221
00:12:57,124 --> 00:12:59,779
And his mother called this
morning. She wants his hero dog
at the funeral.

222
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:02,085
Sir, are you asking me to fly
a damn dog to Arizona?

223
00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:04,174
No, I'm asking you
to drive a Ranger to Arizona.

224
00:13:04,218 --> 00:13:05,480
She refuses to fly.

225
00:13:05,523 --> 00:13:08,091
Why ain't she deploying
with you?

226
00:13:08,135 --> 00:13:10,311
Won't work with anyone. One
minute she's good, the next
minute, she's sending three guys
to the ER.

227
00:13:10,354 --> 00:13:14,097
Riley kept trying
after you guys got blown up,
but she's gone all the way.

228
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:17,057
Maybe Riley should have thought
of that before he broke the
speed of sound into a tree.

229
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,581
- Yeah, well,
Rangers find a way to die.
- Hold on,
let me get this straight,

230
00:13:19,624 --> 00:13:21,844
so I agree to do this,
and you're gonna call
Black Canopy

231
00:13:21,888 --> 00:13:25,152
-and get my packet pushed.
-You do this, and then I make
the call, no screw-ups,

232
00:13:25,195 --> 00:13:28,242
nothing gets back to me. After
the service, you drop off on
base down at White Sands,

233
00:13:28,285 --> 00:13:29,765
they'll handle the rest.

234
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,419
White Sands? So they're just
gonna put her down anyway.

235
00:13:31,462 --> 00:13:33,856
There's not a handler or a PD
crazy enough to adopt her up.

236
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,467
Doesn't make us feel warm
and fuzzy inside.
Just is what it is.

237
00:13:36,511 --> 00:13:40,558
How about I disappear her ass,
you make the call, and we both
go on with our lives? How about
that?

238
00:13:40,602 --> 00:13:43,518
You stick your neck out for
Battalion, I'll stick mine out
for you.

239
00:13:43,561 --> 00:13:45,259
-Take it or leave it.
-Sir...

240
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:49,437
Ready to pick up
your furry flash-bang?

241
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,699
[Briggs]
That's what I'm told, man.

242
00:13:50,742 --> 00:13:52,614
[Jones]
Here's the deal, Briggs,

243
00:13:52,657 --> 00:13:54,659
this isn't the same dog
you served with,

244
00:13:54,703 --> 00:13:57,010
she's got every combat trigger
in the book.

245
00:13:57,053 --> 00:13:58,663
So you keep her secured

246
00:13:58,707 --> 00:13:59,926
and you don't take her out
in public.

247
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:03,668
We clear?

248
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:08,717
All right.

249
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,111
If anyone asks, say she's
on her way to rehabilitation.

250
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,680
Hey, do you want me
to leash her up for you?

251
00:14:15,724 --> 00:14:17,204
No, let's just
get this over with.

252
00:14:17,247 --> 00:14:18,248
All right.

253
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:23,645
What's up, dog?

254
00:14:25,777 --> 00:14:26,474
You remember me?

255
00:14:27,127 --> 00:14:28,519
[growls softly]

256
00:14:28,563 --> 00:14:30,478
Your favorite chew toy
from 2015.

257
00:14:33,046 --> 00:14:35,091
Huh?

258
00:14:35,135 --> 00:14:36,701
Me and you are gonna go
on a little road trip.

259
00:14:36,745 --> 00:14:37,877
[dog panting]

260
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,791
[Briggs] Fifteen hundred miles.

261
00:14:39,835 --> 00:14:42,316
Just to act like your daddy's
looking down on us from above.

262
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,319
All right, I'm gonna
leash you up.

263
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,973
All right?

264
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:50,411
Be cool. Easy.

265
00:14:51,803 --> 00:14:52,543
Easy.

266
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:59,637
You really did give up, huh?

267
00:14:59,681 --> 00:15:01,901
What are y'all so scared of?
She's milding out big-time.

268
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:04,294
-[groans]
-[laughter]

269
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:05,382
[Briggs] Stop!

270
00:15:06,644 --> 00:15:08,472
Enough!

271
00:15:08,516 --> 00:15:10,126
Hey, man, I forgot to
tell you not to touch her
on the ears, man.

272
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:11,519
I left that part out.

273
00:15:11,562 --> 00:15:13,956
[barking and whining]

274
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,523
[man] Hey, we weaned
her off the Prozac,

275
00:15:15,566 --> 00:15:17,307
so she might get moody
from time to time.

276
00:15:17,351 --> 00:15:19,005
Her muzzle can only stay on

277
00:15:19,048 --> 00:15:20,832
for about two hours at a time
or she'll overheat.

278
00:15:20,876 --> 00:15:22,530
Make sure you put water
in her food,

279
00:15:22,573 --> 00:15:24,140
and as you know,
don't touch her ears.

280
00:15:24,184 --> 00:15:25,533
Other than that,
here's your Bible.

281
00:15:25,576 --> 00:15:26,926
-Have a good trip.
-See you, Trent.

282
00:15:28,231 --> 00:15:29,711
[barking]

283
00:15:29,754 --> 00:15:31,452
Thank you, sir.

284
00:15:31,495 --> 00:15:32,714
All the belongings in
Sergeant Rodriguez's backpack

285
00:15:32,757 --> 00:15:34,063
go to his family.

286
00:15:34,107 --> 00:15:35,673
They want his uniform
at the funeral.

287
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:37,153
The "I Love Me" book,
that stays with Lulu.

288
00:15:37,197 --> 00:15:39,808
If you have any trouble,
all her info's in there.

289
00:15:39,851 --> 00:15:41,331
I'm not gonna be out there
long enough.

290
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:44,204
-Hey.
-Rangers lead the way, sir.

291
00:15:44,247 --> 00:15:45,335
-All the way.
-[Lulu barking]

292
00:15:50,906 --> 00:15:52,603
-[man 1] Good luck.
-[Briggs] All right, boys.

293
00:15:52,647 --> 00:15:53,996
[man 2] Looks like Briggs
finally got a girl.

294
00:15:56,042 --> 00:15:58,435
["Run It" playing]

295
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,853
-[line ringing]
-This is Dorith.

296
00:16:24,896 --> 00:16:26,637
Hey, Dorith,
this is Jackson Briggs again.

297
00:16:26,681 --> 00:16:27,899
I was just calling
to let you guys know

298
00:16:27,943 --> 00:16:29,510
that I only fly business class

299
00:16:29,553 --> 00:16:31,642
to countries with names
that end in "stan."

300
00:16:31,686 --> 00:16:33,427
Sir, we're still missing
your recommendation.

301
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,168
Uh, look, it's actually
what I was callin' about.

302
00:16:35,211 --> 00:16:36,299
-[whining]
-So, first thing

303
00:16:36,343 --> 00:16:37,909
Monday morning, uh,

304
00:16:37,953 --> 00:16:39,476
you'll be getting a call
from Captain Luke Jones

305
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,261
from Second Ranger Battalion.

306
00:16:41,304 --> 00:16:43,045
If we hear from your captain
before Wednesday,

307
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:44,829
I'll let the RSO know

308
00:16:44,873 --> 00:16:46,614
-to expect you on rotation.
-[whining and barking]

309
00:16:46,657 --> 00:16:48,311
Yes, ma'am, I'm very, very
happy to be working with...

310
00:16:48,355 --> 00:16:50,052
-[continues barking]
-Yes, sir, I can't hear you...

311
00:16:50,096 --> 00:16:52,054
Yes, ma'am, yes, ma'am,
thank you so much. I... Okay.

312
00:16:52,098 --> 00:16:53,273
[Lulu barking]

313
00:16:53,316 --> 00:16:54,317
[Briggs] What?

314
00:16:56,276 --> 00:16:58,060
[frustratedly]
What is your deal, man?

315
00:16:58,104 --> 00:17:00,497
-Come on.
-[whines]

316
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,325
You're just slobbering
all over my seat.

317
00:17:02,369 --> 00:17:05,067
[barking and whining]

318
00:17:05,111 --> 00:17:06,851
Maybe just take
the crazy down.

319
00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:08,984
-Just like one notch.
-[Lulu whining]

320
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,813
Just one notch, that's it,
and maybe we could get along.

321
00:17:11,856 --> 00:17:13,597
-[whines]
-And if we get along,

322
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:15,295
maybe we could
even have some fun

323
00:17:15,338 --> 00:17:16,905
and send Riley off right.

324
00:17:16,948 --> 00:17:18,559
-[whining]
-Doesn't that sound nice, dog?

325
00:17:20,648 --> 00:17:23,477
I'm all you got, I'm it.

326
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,827
-It's just me.
-[whining]

327
00:17:26,915 --> 00:17:28,308
Believe it or not,
I don't wanna

328
00:17:28,351 --> 00:17:30,614
keep you all muzzled up 24/7.

329
00:17:30,658 --> 00:17:32,355
I really don't.

330
00:17:32,399 --> 00:17:34,662
And to be honest,
I don't wanna drive

331
00:17:34,705 --> 00:17:36,968
straight to some
dry-ass desert town

332
00:17:37,012 --> 00:17:40,320
and just sit in a motel
and stare at a wall for five
days waiting for his funeral.

333
00:17:40,363 --> 00:17:42,061
-[barks]
-Do you?

334
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:47,501
[barking]
Come on, man. Okay,
okay, fine, fine, fine, fine.

335
00:17:47,544 --> 00:17:50,243
All right. So I gotta
take your muzzle off,

336
00:17:50,286 --> 00:17:52,071
but if you bite me,

337
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:53,724
I'm gonna leave it on
all the way to Arizona.

338
00:17:53,768 --> 00:17:55,987
-[Lulu growling]
-So be chill,

339
00:17:56,031 --> 00:17:58,120
-all right? That's great.
-[growling stops]

340
00:17:58,164 --> 00:17:59,861
-[starts growling]
-Just remember all those times

341
00:17:59,904 --> 00:18:02,951
we had fun kicking in doors,
getting our murder on.

342

Easy. Do not bite me
in the face, all right?

344
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:12,134
I'm gonna reach up,

345
00:18:12,178 --> 00:18:14,745
I'm not gonna touch your ears,
or near your ears.

-All right,
I'm not touchin' that,
I'm not touchin' that.

347
00:18:17,487 --> 00:18:20,273
All right, all right. We're
good, we're good. Okay, look at
that. We did it, we did it.

348
00:18:20,316 --> 00:18:21,448
We did it.

Stop it. Hey, hey, chill out.

00:18:28,368 --> 00:18:30,544
Fine, fine.
Stay in there then.

353
00:18:30,587 --> 00:18:33,155
Stay in there, have fun.

Oh, my God!

You just stay right there!

You know, I was
gonna let you have

00:19:50,276 --> 00:19:51,625
a little bit of fun
on this trip.

00:19:51,668 --> 00:19:54,018
I was gonna let you
run and frolic,

you know, sniff some buttholes
and all that, but no,

turns out they are right,
you're just a demon.

No?

Oh, what's happening?

384
00:20:50,597 --> 00:20:51,946
You're gettin' a little sleepy
back there?

Someone gettin'
a little tired, tired?

Oh, allergy season
is brutal this year.

Man, you used to be a legend.
Not no more, huh?

Wait, what'd you say?

Oh! Daddy should go out
and get some beers,
you're right.

391
00:21:05,568 --> 00:21:08,441
Let you get a little shut-eye.
Okay, I'll do that.

392
00:21:08,484 --> 00:21:10,921
That's really nice of you.
You're right, too,

What're you...
Ma'am, what're you having?

-[Briggs] Maker's.

Can we get two more
of those, please?

403
00:21:34,728 --> 00:21:36,251
You want me to tease it,
or add to it?

404
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,470
Please don't tease it,
just Maker's in a glass.

-That'll be great.
-Awesome.

Look, all I'm saying is
every single one of those kids

We're not heroes.
We just do our jobs.

I mean, you don't have to
wait in this line, you know?

You just pop on that

411
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,786
you're at the illest bar
on Earth,

412
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,353
hanging with guys like me.

413
00:21:51,397 --> 00:21:53,573
How do you get to
the actual beers, though?

414
00:21:53,616 --> 00:21:56,358
Virtual beers, bro.
That's the beauty of it.

Yeah, that's exactly
what I was saying. Yeah.

421
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,373
So at what point
did you realize

422
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:13,114
that you were just a pawn
for big oil?

423
00:22:13,157 --> 00:22:14,420

All these big oil fat cats,

427
00:22:19,773 --> 00:22:21,122
they think that
they own this place.

They think they own
Mother Earth,

429
00:22:22,428 --> 00:22:23,907
but no one owns Mother Earth,

430
00:22:23,951 --> 00:22:25,387
and I'm gonna fight
against them every day

431
00:22:25,431 --> 00:22:26,693
for the rest of my life

-Wow!

those ducks in the goo.

Look, and if you invite 50

435
00:22:31,306 --> 00:22:32,568

you get half off.

to come right back?

you're gonna love this,

I said, "You will meet
a construction worker

446
00:22:51,282 --> 00:22:53,763
or a soldier."

00:22:53,807 --> 00:22:56,287
-That's interesting.
-Or, I don't know,

a white savior complex.

449
00:23:00,814 --> 00:23:01,815
Good luck.

Wait, what?

451
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:06,297
I hope that you get
the help that you need.

452
00:23:06,341 --> 00:23:08,169
-Thanks for the drink.
-No, no. Look, look,

00:23:08,212 --> 00:23:09,997
look, hey, I've been trapped
by the Taliban.

Hey.

have a conversation with.

with you. Here.

to drug you.

00:23:30,931 --> 00:23:32,759
You didn't have to eat my
seats, that's all I'm saying.

00:23:32,802 --> 00:23:35,414
We can be friends, but this is
gonna be an eye for an eye.

she's a little sad right now.

She's... She's, um, grieving.

[woman 1] Oh, no, sweetheart.

479
00:24:09,143 --> 00:24:11,450
I know. Who are...
Who are these little cuties?

Mmm-hmm. Cheers.

sometimes, though.

00:24:40,827 --> 00:24:42,568
That's sick. Is that, like...
That's like yoga?

495
00:24:42,611 --> 00:24:45,701
I've done yoga.
But I'm horrible at it.

by moving blocked energy

Oh.

500
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,367
So you just move
the energy for...

501
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:00,977
Hell, yeah. I can...

502
00:25:01,021 --> 00:25:02,936
I mean, I got... I got cash
in the truck, I think.

503
00:25:02,979 --> 00:25:04,415
[chuckles] Oh, no, no.

504
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,942
No, the attraction
is completely genuine.

505
00:25:10,378 --> 00:25:11,727
Ah. I mean...

506
00:25:11,771 --> 00:25:13,120
As long as
it's in the flow for you.

507
00:25:14,687 --> 00:25:16,384
No, I'm good.

[man] Time for you
to start squealing.

685
00:34:09,482 --> 00:34:10,918
Hey, have you seen a dog?

686
00:34:10,961 --> 00:34:13,094
She's brown, she's, like,
running around,

687
00:34:13,138 --> 00:34:15,314
I don't know,
with crazy eyes, huh?

688
00:34:17,011 --> 00:34:18,360
[man] Tell me who you work for.

689
00:34:18,404 --> 00:34:20,014
[Briggs] Okay, look,

690
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,886
[sighs] I'm obviously not
who you think I am.

691
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:24,540
[man] I know
who the hell you are.

692
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:29,893
Think you're the first
commando they sent up here?

693
00:34:29,937 --> 00:34:30,851
Take my strains?

694
00:34:33,201 --> 00:34:35,899
Look, old man, unless
you're willing to walk this

695
00:34:35,943 --> 00:34:37,075
till the end of the road,

696
00:34:37,118 --> 00:34:38,554
I highly suggest
you cut me loose

697
00:34:38,598 --> 00:34:40,165
and let me go find
my damn dog.

698
00:34:40,208 --> 00:34:42,123
[man] You got five minutes
to clear your head,

699
00:34:42,167 --> 00:34:43,081
or you can join her ass.

700
00:34:44,169 --> 00:34:45,692
[grunts and groans]

701
00:34:46,823 --> 00:34:48,608
[breathing heavily]

702
00:34:56,181 --> 00:34:57,704
[grunting]

703
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:03,579
[groans and pants]

704
00:35:14,547 --> 00:35:15,287
-[zip tie snaps]
-[grunts]

705
00:35:20,857 --> 00:35:22,032
[pig grunting]

706
00:35:24,339 --> 00:35:25,340
[clatters]

707
00:35:36,525 --> 00:35:37,526
Hell, yeah.

708
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:52,150
[man speaking indistinctly]

709
00:35:52,193 --> 00:35:53,934
Who the hell you think
you're talking to?

710
00:35:55,457 --> 00:35:56,763
We'll see about that.

711
00:35:58,591 --> 00:35:59,592
Bitch!

712
00:36:03,465 --> 00:36:04,771
[operatic music playing softly
on speakers]

713
00:36:33,626 --> 00:36:34,888
[man mumbling indistinctly]

714
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:40,850
Oh, that is...
That's bullshit.

715
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,418
[man speaking indistinctly]

716
00:36:43,462 --> 00:36:46,116
[softly] Dog, come here,
come here.

717
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,683
-[Lulu panting]
-[whispers] Now! Come here!

718
00:36:47,727 --> 00:36:49,207
Come here!

719
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:55,038
[woman] Gus, is he awake yet?

720
00:36:55,082 --> 00:36:56,649
[Gus] Wide awake.
He's zip-tied in the barn.

721
00:36:56,692 --> 00:36:58,085
[woman] Zip-tied? Oh, my God.

722
00:36:58,128 --> 00:36:59,869
What the hell
did you do to him?

723
00:36:59,913 --> 00:37:02,045
[Gus] Some shit.
I told him I killed his dog.

724
00:37:02,089 --> 00:37:03,830
[woman] Gus, what do you know
about interrogation?

725
00:37:03,873 --> 00:37:05,484
You were
a conscientious objector.

726
00:37:05,527 --> 00:37:07,312
[Gus] How about a little
damn appreciation?

727
00:37:07,355 --> 00:37:10,097
[woman] I told you not to hit
those edibles so hard.

728
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,273
Cartel? You paranoid maniac.

729
00:37:12,317 --> 00:37:13,796
-Tell him you're...
-[Gus] You're crazy, I'm not...

730
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,842
...a scared old fool
who needs heavy therapy.

731
00:37:15,885 --> 00:37:17,191
Just tell him you're sorry.

732
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,975
[Gus] I shot him
with a tranquilizer.

733
00:37:19,019 --> 00:37:20,847
[woman] I don't care
what you did.
[Gus] I pushed him...

734
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:22,414
.[woman] Now you're making me
upset this little nugget.
-[panting]

735
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:25,330
This perfect noodle...
[mumbling]

736
00:37:25,373 --> 00:37:27,332
[Gus] Listen, let's get
the hell out of here.

737
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:29,508
[woman] 'Cause I wanna look
at your little, little paw.

738
00:37:29,551 --> 00:37:31,118
You're so good.

739
00:37:31,161 --> 00:37:32,424
So good.

740
00:37:32,467 --> 00:37:33,860
-So good.
-[Lulu grunts softly]

741
00:37:33,903 --> 00:37:35,035
[woman] What a little nugget.

742
00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:39,605
-[woman] Honey...
-Look, Jesus, I...

743
00:37:39,648 --> 00:37:40,606
[Briggs] Shut up.

744
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,303
Sit down.

745
00:37:46,351 --> 00:37:47,308
Uh...

746
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,140
How'd you make her
eat out of your hand?

747
00:37:53,662 --> 00:37:54,881
[Lulu whining]

748
00:37:56,361 --> 00:37:58,319
I didn't make her
do anything.

749
00:37:58,363 --> 00:37:59,102
I just talked to her.

750
00:38:00,365 --> 00:38:02,280
By the way, you can do
anything you like

751
00:38:02,323 --> 00:38:03,672
with my idiot husband.

752
00:38:05,108 --> 00:38:06,719
Gus, apologize.

753
00:38:08,155 --> 00:38:10,679
[hesitates] Sorry, dude.
My bad, my bad.

754
00:38:17,425 --> 00:38:19,949
[Lulu whining and panting]

755
00:38:19,993 --> 00:38:21,777
[woman] Hmm, see,
she's just a noodle.

756
00:38:21,821 --> 00:38:23,431
She just needs some good...

757
00:38:23,475 --> 00:38:25,346
I'm just going to touch her
little, little paw.

758
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:27,348
Is she gonna be okay?

759
00:38:27,392 --> 00:38:29,568
Well, I'm worried she may
have broken her foot,

760
00:38:29,611 --> 00:38:31,961
but I'm gonna try my best.

761
00:38:32,005 --> 00:38:34,094
You need to give, um...
What is her name?

762
00:38:34,137 --> 00:38:35,138
Lulu.

763
00:38:35,182 --> 00:38:36,662
Lulu and I some space.

764
00:38:36,705 --> 00:38:38,403
So, um, here.

765
00:38:38,446 --> 00:38:40,579
Come on.
Gus, make yourself useful

766
00:38:40,622 --> 00:38:42,494
and get this man
some clean clothes

767
00:38:42,537 --> 00:38:44,757
because he's really
smelling strongly

768
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,367
of Boris and his friends.

769
00:38:46,411 --> 00:38:48,587
So here, take some
homemade edibles.

770
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,806
Go make friends, okay?

771
00:38:53,026 --> 00:38:55,768
Guys, come on, stop it.
Get outside.

772
00:38:55,811 --> 00:38:57,117
[Gus] You can't tell me that

773
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,988
you did this
with a damn shoestring.

774
00:38:59,032 --> 00:39:00,207
[Briggs] You just gotta
compromise the plastic.

775
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:01,513
That's it. [chuckles]

776
00:39:01,556 --> 00:39:04,211
Listen, I'm a lot better
at permaculture

777
00:39:04,254 --> 00:39:05,386
than I am tying dudes up.

778
00:39:06,605 --> 00:39:09,564
I need to know, man,
how close was I to...

779
00:39:09,608 --> 00:39:11,784
-Dying?
-Yeah.

780
00:39:11,827 --> 00:39:14,003
Pretty...
Pretty close, actually.
I almost put an axe
in the back of your head.

781
00:39:14,047 --> 00:39:15,527
[sighs]

782
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:17,877
[hesitates] This is...
Well done.

783
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,400
-Yeah, right? Right?
-Hmm.

784
00:39:19,444 --> 00:39:22,011
I'm just glad
you love that dog so much.

785
00:39:22,055 --> 00:39:24,231
I don't love that dog.
It's not even my dog.

786
00:39:24,274 --> 00:39:25,841
Come on, get on your back.

787
00:39:25,885 --> 00:39:27,190
Get on your back,
you can do it.

788
00:39:27,234 --> 00:39:28,801
-Come on.
-[Gus] Whose damn dog

789
00:39:28,844 --> 00:39:29,584
-Is it?
-[zip tie snaps]

790
00:39:30,193 --> 00:39:33,371
[both cheering]

791
00:39:33,414 --> 00:39:34,546
[Briggs] Look, you see that?

792
00:39:34,589 --> 00:39:37,375
-You see this?
-[Gus] Yeah.

793
00:39:37,418 --> 00:39:39,072
[Briggs] This is how they teach
them to attract the enemy.
They can smell their clothes
from, like, a mile off.

794
00:39:39,899 --> 00:39:42,815
Is this two dead dudes?

795
00:39:42,858 --> 00:39:44,294
[Briggs laughs]

796
00:39:44,338 --> 00:39:45,861
Yeah. Those are...
That's two Taliban,

797
00:39:45,905 --> 00:39:48,081
uh, dope farmers right there.

798
00:39:48,124 --> 00:39:49,648
Oh, don't look
all shocked, man.

799
00:39:49,691 --> 00:39:51,258
It's war.
It's not all unicorns

800
00:39:51,301 --> 00:39:53,042
and rainbow vaginas
out there, right?

801
00:39:53,695 --> 00:39:56,002
Yeah, I bet.

802
00:39:56,045 --> 00:40:00,136
So why do they call it
I Love Me book?

803
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,921
I don't know.
Uh, but in the army,

804
00:40:01,964 --> 00:40:03,662
they just,
they make us all keep one.

805
00:40:03,705 --> 00:40:06,229
They make us put every single,
last stupid detail in.

806
00:40:08,884 --> 00:40:11,670
So, Lulu's greatest hits.
This is like...

807
00:40:11,713 --> 00:40:13,585
Like her music.
Like, music she...

808
00:40:13,628 --> 00:40:16,370
No, no, no, no, no.
It's the other greatest hits,

809
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,067
you know.

810
00:40:18,111 --> 00:40:20,200
[chuckles] Like,
it's her bodycam footage.

811
00:40:20,243 --> 00:40:21,680
-Oh, Jesus.
-Yeah.

812
00:40:21,723 --> 00:40:22,550
It's the...
[imitates gunshots] kinda...

813
00:40:22,594 --> 00:40:24,465
Yeah, I'll pass.

814
00:40:24,509 --> 00:40:25,858
So let me get this right, man.

815
00:40:25,901 --> 00:40:28,687
So, like, the dog
did all this, man.

816
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:30,036
I mean, they're just
going to put her down?

817
00:40:32,212 --> 00:40:34,867
Look, don't get all
misty-eyed on me, big man.

818
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,869
Like, it's...
It's not like that.

819
00:40:36,912 --> 00:40:40,176
That dog did exactly
what she was born to do,

820
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:42,657
and that was to live
a legendary life.

821
00:40:43,528 --> 00:40:44,311
And she did it.

822
00:40:47,749 --> 00:40:48,707
What the hell is this here?

823
00:40:49,577 --> 00:40:51,144
"Dear Lulu,

824
00:40:51,187 --> 00:40:53,363
I can hardly imagine life
before I knew you.

825
00:40:53,407 --> 00:40:56,497
Did you come into this world
a beast of fury,

826
00:40:56,541 --> 00:40:58,630
-or were you just..."
-What was that? What was that?

827
00:40:58,673 --> 00:41:00,632
He wrote... It's like written
up on top right there.

828
00:41:00,675 --> 00:41:02,503
There's a couple of 'em,

829
00:41:02,547 --> 00:41:04,940
like poems or love letters,
or something.

830
00:41:04,984 --> 00:41:08,466
Rodriguez could barely spell.

831
00:41:08,509 --> 00:41:11,120
I mean, he definitely
can't rhyme.

832
00:41:11,164 --> 00:41:13,035
I know what this is.
This is...

833
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:14,515
So when you have
a brain injury,

834
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:17,126
you basically get sent
to these brain doctors.

835
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:20,390
And then they study you,
and they make you draw

836
00:41:20,434 --> 00:41:22,654
and write and do
all this art therapy bullshit.

837
00:41:22,697 --> 00:41:24,525
Nobody really
takes it serious.

838
00:41:24,569 --> 00:41:25,570
-Shit!
-Oh!

839
00:41:25,613 --> 00:41:26,875
-[woman laughs]
-Dog!

840
00:41:26,919 --> 00:41:28,529
-You're okay. Hey.
-[Lulu barking]

841
00:41:28,573 --> 00:41:30,226
Look at her.
She's running around.

842
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:32,533
Yeah. There was just
a little piece of barbed wire

843
00:41:32,577 --> 00:41:34,361
just lodged way up in her paw.

844
00:41:34,404 --> 00:41:36,319
I sterilized it
and stopped the bleeding.

845
00:41:36,363 --> 00:41:37,930
Never seen a dog so strong.

846
00:41:37,973 --> 00:41:39,975
Thank you. Thank you so much.

847
00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:42,500
Also, she did offer me
a transmission.

848
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:45,154
-If you feel called.
-Transmission?

849
00:41:45,198 --> 00:41:47,722
Yeah, she bats
about 350 on those.

850
00:41:47,766 --> 00:41:49,463
I mean, but, you know,

851
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:52,161
if it was baseball,
it'd be hall of fame numbers.

852
00:41:53,772 --> 00:41:55,338
[woman] Wow.

853
00:41:55,382 --> 00:41:57,906
You two are definitely
karmically connected.

854
00:41:59,255 --> 00:42:01,127
She must have incarnated

Uh, wow.

Yeah. She loves kids.

-A boy's name?
-Uh, Sam.

869
00:42:36,641 --> 00:42:38,251
[Gus] Oh.

870
00:42:38,294 --> 00:42:40,645
Um, what about my daughter?

871
00:42:40,688 --> 00:42:44,039
Well, Lulu, she's bringing her
into my awareness.

872
00:42:44,083 --> 00:42:45,040

873

00:43:05,495 --> 00:43:07,802
She says she's never slept
in a nice bed before.

882
00:43:07,846 --> 00:43:09,238
She asks if it's okay.

-Strike three.

if we did,

you were definitely digging
the bigger hole

[laughs] Hey! No!

1030
00:49:22,176 --> 00:49:23,656
Get off! Get off there!

1031
00:49:23,699 --> 00:49:25,005
Don't do it! Stop!

1032
00:49:25,049 --> 00:49:27,007
No! No! You...

1033
00:49:27,051 --> 00:49:29,705
Okay. You know what?
I didn't even care anyways.

1034
00:49:29,749 --> 00:49:30,837
That was your bed.
'Cause I'm going out.

1035
00:49:31,272 --> 00:49:33,492
[whining]

1036
00:49:34,536 --> 00:49:36,974
[TV playing indistinctly]

1037
00:49:45,634 --> 00:49:48,072
Do I look like 200k a year
or what?

1038
00:49:48,115 --> 00:49:51,249
Look at you, sitting on
the couch, looking all cute.

1039
00:49:51,292 --> 00:49:53,555
Why didn't you tell me
all I had to do was just

1040
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:56,384
turn on the TV and put your
greatest hits on of you mauling
people, to get you to relax?

1041
00:49:57,342 --> 00:49:59,039
[chuckles] You narcissist.

1042
00:49:59,083 --> 00:50:01,520
What happened, no go
on the Indian food?

1043
00:50:01,563 --> 00:50:02,564
I told you,
you can't trust psychics.

1044
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:05,306
But don't you worry.

1045
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:07,439
I got exactly what you want.

1046
00:50:07,482 --> 00:50:11,008
Dry-aged, marbled-on-the-bone
beautifulness. Ready?

1047
00:50:12,835 --> 00:50:14,620
Take it, savor it. Come on.

1048
00:50:16,448 --> 00:50:18,232
You don't have to be scared.
Just take it out of my hand.

1049
00:50:20,191 --> 00:50:21,192
Whatever.

1050
00:50:26,458 --> 00:50:28,634
Do not do anything stupid.

1051
00:50:34,988 --> 00:50:36,337
[growling softly]

1052
00:50:38,687 --> 00:50:39,906
What?

-[whining]
-Hell, no.

1054
00:50:41,777 --> 00:50:43,257
Oh, you think you're
coming with me?

1055
00:50:43,301 --> 00:50:44,737
Do you think I forgot
about Portland?

1056
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,347
-[barks]
-No.

1057
00:50:46,391 --> 00:50:47,522
I'll never forget
about Portland.

1058
00:50:47,566 --> 00:50:49,263
-Ever.
-[barking]

1059
00:50:49,307 --> 00:50:50,656
Go lay back down.

1060
00:50:50,699 --> 00:50:52,092
[barking]

1061
00:50:52,136 --> 00:50:53,354
You asked for the bed,

1062
00:50:53,398 --> 00:50:54,660
I got you the bed.
Go lay down.

1063
00:50:54,703 --> 00:50:55,965

[muzak playing]

1069
00:51:21,382 --> 00:51:23,689
You're a first-class moron,
you know that?

1070
00:51:41,185 --> 00:51:42,186
[Lulu sniffing]

1071
00:51:42,229 --> 00:51:44,405
You smell that, girl? Money.

1072
00:51:45,928 --> 00:51:47,626
Congratulations, by the way.

1073
00:51:48,366 --> 00:51:49,497
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

-Oh, I am so sorry.
-Oh, sir, pardon me.

1077
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:03,772
-[Briggs] I'm... You okay?
-Yes, Mr. Briggs.

1078
00:52:03,816 --> 00:52:05,600
-Of course, yeah.
-Wait, I know that voice.

1079
00:52:05,644 --> 00:52:08,386
-Wait. Who's that?
-Oh, we met at the front desk.

1080
00:52:08,429 --> 00:52:09,996
-[Briggs] Oh, the... Yes.
-Callan.

1081
00:52:10,039 --> 00:52:11,519
[Briggs] Yes, Callan,
the front desk angel.

1082
00:52:11,563 --> 00:52:13,130
I'm looking for a place
to eat tonight.

1083
00:52:13,173 --> 00:52:14,783
-Oh, there are...
-Any good recommendations?

1084
00:52:14,827 --> 00:52:16,437
[Callan] Yes, there's
a fantastic oyster bar

1085
00:52:16,481 --> 00:52:17,351
down at the Embarcadero.

1086
00:52:17,395 --> 00:52:18,918
[Briggs] I love oysters.

1087
00:52:18,961 --> 00:52:20,311
They really, you know,
heighten the senses.

1088
00:52:20,354 --> 00:52:21,442
-What time do you get off?
-[Lulu growling softly]

1089
00:52:21,486 --> 00:52:22,965
Uh, I'm off at00.

[Callan] Oh my god, take your
time, take your time.

1102
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:52,821
Are you okay?

1103
00:52:52,865 --> 00:52:54,258
[Callan] Somebody get a doctor.

1104
00:52:54,301 --> 00:52:56,782
-I'm so sorry.
-[Lulu whining and barking]

1105
00:52:59,872 --> 00:53:01,874
No!

1106
00:53:01,917 --> 00:53:03,702
[Callan] You all right?
Take it easy, take it easy.

1107
00:53:03,745 --> 00:53:05,791
Okay. Here we go, here we go.

1108
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:11,797
Oh, my God, I can...
I can see.

1109
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:16,105
I can see. Guys, I can see!

1110
00:53:16,149 --> 00:53:17,585
[indistinct chatter]

1111
00:53:20,632 --> 00:53:24,244
Hey, hey! Hey!

1112
00:53:24,288 --> 00:53:27,073
[officer] So you were
impersonating a blind man

1113
00:53:27,116 --> 00:53:30,032
as part of a seeing eye
dog training exercise?

1114
00:53:30,076 --> 00:53:31,947
-[Briggs] Yep, that's right.
-Mmm-hmm.

1115
00:53:31,991 --> 00:53:35,473
When suddenly, uh,
unbeknownst to you,

1116
00:53:35,516 --> 00:53:38,127
um, your dog broke free
from your grasp,

1117
00:53:38,171 --> 00:53:39,999
sprinted the entire length
of the lobby

1118
00:53:40,042 --> 00:53:42,262
-and muzzle struck the victim?
-Correct.

1119
00:53:42,306 --> 00:53:43,872
[officer] And you've never
seen this dog exhibit

1120
00:53:43,916 --> 00:53:45,657
any type of aggressive
behavior before this?

1121
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:48,616
Never. Never. She usually...
She loves people.

1122
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:51,097
It's out of her character.
I really don't understand it.

1123
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:52,925
-Man, honestly, I'm in shock.
-[clicks tongue] Uh-huh.

1124
00:53:55,014 --> 00:53:56,320
Is there anything else
you want to add?

1125
00:53:56,363 --> 00:53:57,625
How is the guy?
Is he all right?

1126
00:53:57,669 --> 00:53:59,061
-Yeah.
-He seemed okay.

1127
00:53:59,105 --> 00:54:00,324
Well, we're gonna
be contacting

1128
00:54:00,367 --> 00:54:02,935
Dr. Al-Farid in the morning.

1129
00:54:02,978 --> 00:54:05,285
He wants to press charges.
We'll take it from there.

1130
00:54:05,329 --> 00:54:08,157
Until then,
you just sit tight.

1131
00:54:08,201 --> 00:54:10,072
[Briggs] Cool, and the dog?
Dog's okay?

1132
00:54:10,116 --> 00:54:11,378
[officer] We're gonna
have to check

1133
00:54:11,422 --> 00:54:12,901
with animal control
on that one.

1134
00:54:12,945 --> 00:54:14,294
[Briggs] Okay.
So when do I get her back?

1135
00:54:14,338 --> 00:54:16,165
Do I have to post bail
or whatever?

1136
00:54:16,209 --> 00:54:18,951
[officer] Post bail?
Buddy, it is Friday night.

1137
00:54:18,994 --> 00:54:21,432
Judge is not back
until Monday A.M.

1138
00:54:21,475 --> 00:54:25,131
And I am required
to keep all suspects

1139
00:54:25,174 --> 00:54:26,872
in possible hate crimes
in my custody.

1140
00:54:26,915 --> 00:54:28,526
Hate crime?

1141
00:54:28,569 --> 00:54:30,267
Now, don't start with me.
Take it to City Hall.

1142
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:31,964
Who said anything about a hate
crime? Wait, wait, wait.

1143
00:54:32,007 --> 00:54:33,792
Hold on a second. Okay.
All right. Let me... Let me...

1144
00:54:33,835 --> 00:54:34,793
Let me level with you, man.

1145
00:54:36,098 --> 00:54:37,491
Okay? I was an Army Ranger.

1146
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:40,929
That dog's handler was
my buddy, and he passed.

1147
00:54:40,973 --> 00:54:43,932
I got to take her down to his
funeral in Arizona on Sunday.

1148
00:54:43,976 --> 00:54:46,500
I got a Gold Star family
that's just depending on me

1149
00:54:46,544 --> 00:54:47,893
to get her there.

1150
00:54:47,936 --> 00:54:49,329
All right?
Now I'll be back here

1151
00:54:49,373 --> 00:54:50,896
first thing Monday morning.
I promise.

1152
00:54:50,939 --> 00:54:52,332
I just... I got to...
I got to get her

1153
00:54:52,376 --> 00:54:53,333
and I got to go tonight.

1154
00:54:55,988 --> 00:54:57,163
You were an Army Ranger?

1155
00:54:57,206 --> 00:54:58,904
-[Briggs] Yeah.
-[chuckles]

1156
00:55:01,036 --> 00:55:02,211
Why the hell
didn't you say so?

1157
00:55:03,691 --> 00:55:05,258
-I'm sorry.
-Instead of puttin' me through

1158
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:07,391
20 minutes of that Ray Charles
bullshit, huh?

1159
00:55:07,434 --> 00:55:09,218
I was in the 202nd.

1160
00:55:09,262 --> 00:55:10,350
Hey, buddy,
I gotta tell you something.

1161
00:55:10,394 --> 00:55:11,830
And I gotta level with you.

1162
00:55:11,873 --> 00:55:13,397
You going into that
hotel lobby, huh,

1163
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,399
with that damn cane
and those glasses, man.

1164
00:55:15,442 --> 00:55:16,574
You Army Rangers,

1165
00:55:16,617 --> 00:55:18,271
you've got balls of steel.

1166
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:19,881
-No. It was stupid.
-I'm a huge fan, seriously.

1167
00:55:19,925 --> 00:55:21,143
Hey, I gotta ask
you something,
on the real, on the real.

1168
00:55:23,102 --> 00:55:24,756
You sent that little beast
for that raghead, didn't ya?

1169
00:55:25,496 --> 00:55:27,019
-What?
-Huh?

1170
00:55:27,062 --> 00:55:28,890
Get a little payback for what
they took from us, right?

1171
00:55:28,934 --> 00:55:30,501
-Right?
-No. I... No,

1172
00:55:30,544 --> 00:55:32,372
-definitely, I didn't do that.
-Come on. Don't worry, man.

1173
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:34,200
My lips are sealed.
I'm not gonna say nothing.

1174
00:55:34,243 --> 00:55:36,376
And us 31 Alphas,
we keep it tight.

1175
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:38,073
-You know?
-Alpha 31s?

1176
00:55:38,117 --> 00:55:39,510
Yeah, we looked out for you
badasses real good.

1177
00:55:40,424 --> 00:55:41,990
Out by the front gate, right?

1178
00:55:42,817 --> 00:55:44,036
Oh, you were an MP.

1179
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:45,385
-Damn right.
-Right.

1180
00:55:45,429 --> 00:55:46,865
What are you implying?

1181
00:55:46,908 --> 00:55:48,954
Oh, no, no,
I'm not implying anything.

1182
00:55:49,563 --> 00:55:51,783
No, I mean, we...

1183
00:55:51,826 --> 00:55:55,264
You MPs, man,
you guys got a hard job.

1184
00:55:55,308 --> 00:55:57,092
I never slept better
knowing that you guys

1185
00:55:57,136 --> 00:55:58,746
were out there
at the guardhouse,

1186
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:00,400
on the wall, watching over us.

1187
00:56:00,444 --> 00:56:02,402
Yeah, I appreciate
that, brother.

1188
00:56:02,446 --> 00:56:04,012
Yeah, I appreciate it too
that you're not like

1189
00:56:04,056 --> 00:56:06,145
all those other Army Rangers
that I've met.

1190
00:56:06,188 --> 00:56:07,668
You know, with the long beards

1191
00:56:07,712 --> 00:56:09,844
flowing in the wind,
like they were Moses?

1192
00:56:09,888 --> 00:56:13,674
The car going right by the
front gate, not showin' an ID,

1193
00:56:13,718 --> 00:56:16,155
flipping us off,
"Thank you for your service."

1194
00:56:16,198 --> 00:56:17,417
Yeah, you're not one
of those guys, are you?

1195
00:56:17,461 --> 00:56:18,853
-No, I...
-No, no, no.

1196
00:56:18,897 --> 00:56:20,333
-No, I definitely...
-You know what?

1197
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:22,466
I buy that.
You know what else I buy?

1198
00:56:22,509 --> 00:56:27,296
White military guy sics
his dog on a Muslim doctor

1199
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:29,821
in the heart of
woke-ing class America.

1200
00:56:29,864 --> 00:56:31,431
[Briggs] Man, don't do this.

1201
00:56:31,475 --> 00:56:33,651
Don't do this. Just let me
get my dog and go.

1202
00:56:33,694 --> 00:56:35,000
Oh, now it's your dog!

1203
00:56:37,132 --> 00:56:38,264
Sleep tight, bitch.

1204
00:56:39,483 --> 00:56:40,614
[sighs]

1205
00:56:40,658 --> 00:56:41,659
[door closes]

1206
00:56:46,141 --> 00:56:47,012
[man] Briggs?

1207
00:56:48,361 --> 00:56:50,058
[knocking]

1208
00:56:50,102 --> 00:56:51,408
[man] Rise and shine.
Line-up time.

1209
00:56:56,804 --> 00:56:58,023
Step to the left.

1210
00:57:00,504 --> 00:57:02,027
Really? A line-up?
It's like...

1211
00:57:02,854 --> 00:57:04,333
It's me, right?

1212
00:57:04,377 --> 00:57:06,248
[man] Everybody,
step to your right.

1213
00:57:06,292 --> 00:57:08,599
What are we doing?
Did you guys even have dogs?

1214
00:57:09,861 --> 00:57:11,819
He seems like a cat guy.

1215
00:57:11,863 --> 00:57:13,473
- Quiet, number three.
- [over speakers]
We all know it was me, right?

1216
00:57:13,517 --> 00:57:14,213
Yes, it was him.

1217
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,041
Face forward.

1218
00:57:16,737 --> 00:57:18,260
It's him.

1219
00:57:18,304 --> 00:57:19,958
I got it. Thank you, sir.

1220
00:57:20,001 --> 00:57:22,439
Can I... Can I just, like...
You know what?

1221
00:57:22,482 --> 00:57:24,136
I'm just gonna confess.
How about that?

1222
00:57:24,179 --> 00:57:26,007
Step back, number three.

1223
00:57:26,051 --> 00:57:27,748
No, I'm sorry. Can I confess?
Is that, like, a thing?

1224
00:57:27,792 --> 00:57:29,228
Man, I've got lunch.

1225
00:57:29,271 --> 00:57:30,751
It was my fault. I don't...

1226
00:57:30,795 --> 00:57:32,536
Look, my dog,

1227
00:57:32,579 --> 00:57:35,103
she was just doing
what she was trained to do.

1228
00:57:35,147 --> 00:57:37,149
And unfortunately,
she was trained

1229
00:57:37,192 --> 00:57:40,108
to attack guys that look
like Dr. Al-Farid.

1230
00:57:40,152 --> 00:57:41,545
All right, that's enough,
number three.

1231
00:57:41,588 --> 00:57:43,242
Wait, let him speak.

1232
00:57:43,285 --> 00:57:44,678
There. But I'm sorry,
that is the truth.

1233
00:57:44,722 --> 00:57:46,375
She served seven years,
eight deployments,

1234
00:57:46,419 --> 00:57:49,117
but she did save more people
than you can count.

1235
00:57:49,161 --> 00:57:51,076
I'm not some racist
piece of shit,

1236
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:52,730
but I'll confess to whatever
it is that you want me to

1237
00:57:52,773 --> 00:57:54,383
or do whatever you want me to,

1238
00:57:54,427 --> 00:57:56,516
as long as someone promises me

1239
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:59,084
that they will get her
to that funeral this Sunday.

1240
00:57:59,127 --> 00:58:00,912
Is that a deal
that I can make?

1241
00:58:02,783 --> 00:58:04,742
[scoffs] Give me a break.

1242
00:58:04,785 --> 00:58:06,439
All right.
Take him out of here.

1243
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,267
-Really? Nothing.
-[man] Next group in five.

1244
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:10,008
That's it?

1245
00:58:10,051 --> 00:58:11,270
[man] Hold on, number three.

1246
00:58:18,059 --> 00:58:19,887
So you impersonated
a blind man

1247
00:58:19,931 --> 00:58:21,323
just to get a free hotel room?

1248
00:58:23,151 --> 00:58:24,849
Uh, yeah, yeah, I did.

1249
00:58:24,892 --> 00:58:27,199
Um, there was a psychic

1250
00:58:27,242 --> 00:58:28,635
and she said that
she wanted...

1251
00:58:28,679 --> 00:58:30,550
My dog wanted a mat...
Like, a comfy mattress.

1252
00:58:30,594 --> 00:58:31,899
And some... Never mind.

1253
00:58:31,943 --> 00:58:33,118
It's... It's insane.

1254
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:36,730
It is insane.

1255
00:58:37,644 --> 00:58:38,993
And if you want my

1256
00:58:39,037 --> 00:58:40,125
non-clinical opinion,
so are you.

1257
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:43,128
Yeah, that's... That's fair.

1258
00:58:45,086 --> 00:58:48,350
But the more I sit with it,
it's even more insane to

1259
00:58:48,394 --> 00:58:51,310
leave my practice
and fly back from Boston

1260
00:58:51,353 --> 00:58:53,312
just to prosecute a veteran

1261
00:58:53,355 --> 00:58:54,835
trying to get his dog
to a funeral.

1262
00:58:57,751 --> 00:58:59,448
Just promise,
when it's all done,

1263
00:58:59,492 --> 00:59:00,972
you'll seek professional help.

1264
00:59:03,409 --> 00:59:04,541
I, uh... Yes, sir.

1265
00:59:06,194 --> 00:59:08,240
-Salaam.
-Salaam.

-[Briggs] Hey, what's up, dog?
-[Lulu whining]

1270
00:59:22,123 --> 00:59:25,213
What's up? How're you doing?

1271
00:59:25,257 --> 00:59:27,389
Never thought I'd be
this excited to see you.

1272
00:59:27,433 --> 00:59:29,174
Has she always panted so much?

1273
00:59:29,217 --> 00:59:31,611
Yeah, she runs... She runs
hot, I guess, like me.

1274
00:59:31,655 --> 00:59:33,352
She's not hot.

1275
00:59:33,395 --> 00:59:35,963
That's anxiety.
It comes from trauma.

1276
00:59:36,007 --> 00:59:37,312
You know,
she tried to bite my colleague

1277
00:59:37,356 --> 00:59:39,314
when he lightly
touched her on the ears.

1278
00:59:39,358 --> 00:59:41,621
Either take responsibility for
her or find someone who will.

1279
00:59:41,665 --> 00:59:44,232
Okay, thank you.

1280
00:59:50,151 --> 00:59:51,849
You're ready
to get out of here? Huh?

1281
00:59:53,111 --> 00:59:55,461
Your personal effects.
Dismissed.

1282
00:59:56,854 --> 00:59:59,334
As in, get out of my face.

1283
00:59:59,378 --> 01:00:01,859
Did you hear the nice man?
We should get out of his face.

1284
01:00:02,207 --> 01:00:03,208
Come on.

01:00:05,776 --> 01:00:07,081

You're a very photogenic dog,
you know that?

01:00:33,238 --> 01:00:34,979
You look like a hero.

1294
01:00:38,983 --> 01:00:40,724
Why didn't you tell me
you had a brother?

1295
01:00:40,767 --> 01:00:42,247
And he lives in Los Angeles.

1296
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:43,683
We got something in common,
me and you.

1297

You know what?
I'll make you a deal.

You don't do anything
all psychotic on this trip,

1300
01:00:52,953 --> 01:00:55,303
and we make good time,
we can go see him.

1301
01:00:56,609 --> 01:00:59,960
Maybe, okay? Is that a deal?

1302
01:01:00,004 --> 01:01:01,353

you have full permission

the jacket's too much.

She wants to murder me.

1364
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:02,202
[Noah] Relax.
[Briggs] This isn't fun.

1365
01:05:02,246 --> 01:05:03,725
-Relax.
-[Briggs] Come on, come on.

1366
01:05:03,769 --> 01:05:05,379
-Come on, we'll make it fun.
-[Lulu barking]

1367
01:05:05,423 --> 01:05:07,207
It's fun. Take a little piece.

1368
01:05:07,251 --> 01:05:08,600
Take a little piece.
I know you like it.

1369
01:05:08,643 --> 01:05:10,819
-I know you want it.
-[panting]

1370
01:05:10,863 --> 01:05:12,125
[barking]

1371
01:05:12,169 --> 01:05:13,953
Remind me again
why we want her to bite.

1372
01:05:13,997 --> 01:05:16,956
She doesn't know what war is.
For her, it's just work.

1373
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,089
You've got to show her
that work can be fun again,

1374
01:05:19,132 --> 01:05:20,917
nothing bad
is going to happen, okay?

1375
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,527
That's how you make a bond.

1376
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:24,007
I don't need to make
a bond, okay?

1377
01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:25,747
I just... What, am I not
fun enough for you?

1378
01:05:25,791 --> 01:05:26,879
-You're fun.
-Come on.

1379
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:28,098
Just hold your arm up
a bit higher.

1380
01:05:28,141 --> 01:05:29,534
It's up, man. Take it.

1381
01:05:29,577 --> 01:05:30,970
-Come on, just get it.
-[Nuke barks]

1382
01:05:31,014 --> 01:05:33,842
-Good boy, Nuke. Good boy!
-Good boy.

1383
01:05:33,886 --> 01:05:35,583
Let him know
this is love, your chew toy,

1384
01:05:35,627 --> 01:05:36,758
this is fun.

1385
01:05:36,802 --> 01:05:39,674
Good boy, Nuke. Good boy.

1386
01:05:39,718 --> 01:05:40,937
[Briggs] So you're
telling me that Nuke

1387
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:43,026
was just as messed up as Lulu.

1388
01:05:43,069 --> 01:05:45,463
I'd been working every day
for six months

1389
01:05:45,506 --> 01:05:48,379
before I convinced the army
to let me adopt him out.

1390
01:05:48,422 --> 01:05:49,293
Thought we'd never get there.

1391
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:52,731
Now we trust Nuke to babysit.

1392
01:05:52,774 --> 01:05:54,037
Kids, burgers!

1393
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:54,863
Shit.

1394
01:06:00,391 --> 01:06:02,567
Daddy, was this on the ground?

1395
01:06:02,610 --> 01:06:05,004
-No.
-You're lying. I saw it fall.

1396
01:06:05,048 --> 01:06:07,267
Baby, I dropped it
into my hand, okay?

1397
01:06:07,311 --> 01:06:09,182
-It's fine. You're fine.
-[grunts in frustration]

1398
01:06:09,226 --> 01:06:10,531
[grunts]

1399
01:06:10,575 --> 01:06:12,142
[music playing faintly]

1400
01:06:12,185 --> 01:06:12,838
Saturdays.

1401
01:06:15,623 --> 01:06:17,016
I can barely
take care of the dogs.

1402
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:18,278
I don't know
how you're doing all this.

1403
01:06:18,322 --> 01:06:20,150
Yeah, I get it.

1404
01:06:20,193 --> 01:06:21,629
Nuke was about
all I could handle,

1405
01:06:21,673 --> 01:06:23,805
but when he stopped
struggling,

1406
01:06:23,849 --> 01:06:25,155
that's when I realized
maybe I could

1407
01:06:25,198 --> 01:06:26,591
stop struggling too, you know?

1408
01:06:29,115 --> 01:06:31,596
[Briggs] Do you think Riley
could've fixed Lulu?

1409
01:06:31,639 --> 01:06:34,425
[Noah] Not by keeping her
in the fight, no.

1410
01:06:34,468 --> 01:06:37,167
You gotta know when to hang
'em up or check out, I guess.

1411
01:06:39,082 --> 01:06:41,301
Well, sometimes Rangers
just find a way to die, man.

1412
01:06:44,087 --> 01:06:46,089
Give Riley's mom a big hug.

1413
01:06:46,132 --> 01:06:48,656
They didn't talk much, I know,
but she meant a lot to him.

1414
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:50,267
Yeah, I will, man.

1415
01:06:52,573 --> 01:06:58,014
Oh, come on. No! Shit!
You gotta be kidding me.

1416
01:06:59,102 --> 01:07:00,407
No, it's a real
nice neighborhood

1417
01:07:00,451 --> 01:07:01,669
you got here, man.

1418
01:07:03,236 --> 01:07:05,630
They got all my shit.
They got Riley's shit.

1419
01:07:05,673 --> 01:07:07,284
They got my meds.

1420
01:07:07,327 --> 01:07:08,937
Well, that's good.

1421
01:07:08,981 --> 01:07:10,243
At least I can give
his parents his dog tags.

1422
01:07:10,287 --> 01:07:11,679
-[Lulu whining]
-[Briggs] Oh, good.

1423
01:07:11,723 --> 01:07:13,594
They left your unicorn.

1424
01:07:13,638 --> 01:07:16,032
-[Lulu barking]
-Lulu, Lulu, here.

1425
01:07:17,642 --> 01:07:19,078
Seek.

1426
01:07:19,122 --> 01:07:20,166
[sniffing]

1427
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:21,559
[Briggs] Yeah, Lulu, go, seek.

1428
01:07:25,693 --> 01:07:27,043
-[Noah] Good boy.
-[Briggs] Lulu, seek.

1429
01:07:28,522 --> 01:07:29,915
[Noah] Seek, seek.

1430
01:07:32,135 --> 01:07:34,006
What's in here?

1431
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,312
[Briggs] Oh, yeah. There we go.
There we go.

1432
01:07:35,355 --> 01:07:37,488
Good boy, Nuke. Good boy.

1433
01:07:37,531 --> 01:07:39,490
Okay, okay. Come on, Nuke.

1434
01:07:39,533 --> 01:07:40,708
Come, Nuke. Nuke. Seek.

1435
01:07:42,014 --> 01:07:43,711
I guess we're going
in the right direction.

1436
01:07:43,755 --> 01:07:44,669
Seek, seek.

1437
01:07:45,235 --> 01:07:46,410
Seek, seek.

1438
01:07:46,453 --> 01:07:48,281
[Noah] Yes, baby, yes.

1439
01:07:48,325 --> 01:07:50,327
Put the water on,
I'm sure it's boiling.

1440
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:52,242
Yes, pesto is fine.

1441
01:07:52,285 --> 01:07:54,157
We're... I'm just showing
my buddy the Boardwalk.

1442
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,333
Sorry, Tiffany, I just
wanted to see the piers.

1443
01:07:56,376 --> 01:07:58,291
[Noah] Yes, okay.
We'll be back soon, okay?

1444
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:59,336
[Briggs] Seek.

1445
01:08:01,164 --> 01:08:02,774
-Nuke!
-[woman] Oh, hey!

1446
01:08:02,817 --> 01:08:04,776
[panting]

1447
01:08:04,819 --> 01:08:06,778
-[Lulu barking]
-Yeah, Lulu, go, go, seek.

1448
01:08:09,433 --> 01:08:11,130
[Noah] Seek, seek.

1449
01:08:11,174 --> 01:08:13,132
Just don't let her go.
Seek, Nuke.

1450
01:08:14,786 --> 01:08:16,266
Seek.

1451
01:08:16,309 --> 01:08:17,093
Seek, Nuke.

1452
01:08:22,185 --> 01:08:25,362
Seek, seek, seek.

1453
01:08:25,405 --> 01:08:28,495
Find it, Nuke. Find it.

1454
01:08:28,539 --> 01:08:30,018
[indistinct chatter]

1455
01:08:32,412 --> 01:08:34,110
-[man] Hey! Hey!
-[Briggs] Seek.

1456
01:08:34,153 --> 01:08:35,502
[man] Joe! Shut the hell up.

1457
01:08:35,546 --> 01:08:37,504
[sniffing]

1458
01:08:37,548 --> 01:08:40,899
[Briggs] Seek, seek.

1459
01:08:42,422 --> 01:08:43,728
Seek. Seek.

1460
01:08:46,165 --> 01:08:47,427
Seek.

1461
01:08:47,471 --> 01:08:49,908
[Lulu sniffing]

1462
01:08:49,951 --> 01:08:51,823
-[Briggs] Seek.
-[Lulu whines]

1463
01:08:51,866 --> 01:08:52,954
-[barking]
-[Briggs] Yeah, yeah,

1464
01:08:52,998 --> 01:08:53,955
she found it, she found it.

1465
01:08:55,653 --> 01:08:56,741
[Noah] Good boy, Nuke.

1466
01:08:56,784 --> 01:08:58,395
[Briggs] Yeah, this is it.

1467
01:08:58,438 --> 01:09:01,789
Yeah, yeah, it's my shit.
It's just everywhere.

1468
01:09:01,833 --> 01:09:02,921
This crackhead's
probably snorting

1469
01:09:02,964 --> 01:09:04,314
my migraine meds right now.

1470
01:09:05,228 --> 01:09:07,317
[dogs barking]

1471
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:09,014
Yeah, most of
Riley's shit's here.

1472
01:09:09,057 --> 01:09:10,189
Her book's here.

1473
01:09:11,930 --> 01:09:14,715
Hey, what is this shit, man?
This is private property.

1474
01:09:14,759 --> 01:09:16,413
-Oh, is it? That's yours?
-Yeah.

1475
01:09:16,456 --> 01:09:18,328
-All right, Jackson, let's go.
-Your name's Rodriguez?

1476
01:09:18,371 --> 01:09:20,417
Man, I'm a United States
army veteran, man.

1477
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:22,201
Yeah? Take it off right now.

1478
01:09:22,245 --> 01:09:23,681
-I ain't taking off shit.
-What battalion were you in?

1479
01:09:24,377 --> 01:09:25,726
That's classified.

1480
01:09:25,770 --> 01:09:27,641
[groaning and screaming]

1481
01:09:27,685 --> 01:09:30,601
[Briggs] Get it off!
Get it off!

1482
01:09:30,644 --> 01:09:34,561
[thief continues screaming]
Oh, goddamn, man.

1483
01:09:34,605 --> 01:09:36,955
Hey, I serve my country,

1484
01:09:36,998 --> 01:09:38,565
and this is the thanks I get?

1485
01:09:38,609 --> 01:09:39,871
I'm a war hero!

1486
01:09:39,914 --> 01:09:41,655
[man] Get the fuck
outta here, man!

1487
01:09:41,699 --> 01:09:43,266
[Noah] You're gonna be
all good without those meds?

1488
01:09:43,309 --> 01:09:44,702
[Briggs] I should have
just let her eat

1489
01:09:44,745 --> 01:09:46,573
that stolen valor
piece of shit.

1490
01:09:46,617 --> 01:09:48,793
[Noah] You never know in places
like that who served.

1491
01:09:49,924 --> 01:09:51,622
And if you were here
five years ago,

1492
01:09:51,665 --> 01:09:53,493
you could have caught my ass
under that pier,

1493
01:09:53,537 --> 01:09:55,887
and that would have been
the best-case scenario.

1494
01:09:55,930 --> 01:09:57,802
[Briggs] Yeah, but I didn't.

1495
01:09:57,845 --> 01:09:59,195
'Cause that bullshit ain't us.

1496
01:09:59,238 --> 01:10:00,239
Yeah?

1497
01:10:00,283 --> 01:10:01,240
What about Riley?

1498
01:10:02,154 --> 01:10:03,938
What about Riley?

1499
01:10:03,982 --> 01:10:06,071
I mean, the dude
couldn't get out of bed
without popping three percs.

1500
01:10:07,333 --> 01:10:08,813
Well, that's just
the breakfast of champions,

1501
01:10:08,856 --> 01:10:10,597
and he was a champion.

1502
01:10:10,641 --> 01:10:13,078
I can't tell you how many
times he called me up,

1503
01:10:13,121 --> 01:10:14,732
we'd get shitfaced
talking about

1504
01:10:14,775 --> 01:10:16,429
how we were gonna check out.

1505
01:10:16,473 --> 01:10:18,910
Look, man, we all
deal with shit

1506
01:10:18,953 --> 01:10:20,738
to stay in the game, okay?

1507
01:10:20,781 --> 01:10:22,130
So we're supposed
to stay in it forever?

1508
01:10:23,393 --> 01:10:24,916
He used to talk
about driving off

1509
01:10:24,959 --> 01:10:26,831
the Grand Canyon at top speed,

1510
01:10:26,874 --> 01:10:29,312
but he drove himself
into a tree instead.

1511
01:10:34,317 --> 01:10:35,753
I tried to get him to talk.

1512
01:10:36,928 --> 01:10:38,625
Talk, like what,
to a therapist?

1513
01:10:38,669 --> 01:10:40,236
That was a great idea.

1514
01:10:40,279 --> 01:10:42,020
No, to other guys
who have gone through it,

1515
01:10:42,063 --> 01:10:43,064
or even just to God.

1516
01:10:43,891 --> 01:10:45,458
God?

1517
01:10:45,502 --> 01:10:47,678
Okay, you didn't know shit
about Riley, all right?

1518
01:10:47,721 --> 01:10:49,680
Look, by God, I mean anything.

1519
01:10:49,723 --> 01:10:51,159
Could be a rock,
could be a shoe,

1520
01:10:51,203 --> 01:10:53,118
could be his damn barber.

1521
01:10:53,161 --> 01:10:55,903
But we all got to pick
something at some point.

1522
01:10:56,556 --> 01:10:57,557
[Briggs] Well...

1523
01:10:59,864 --> 01:11:03,781
he didn't, and he won't.

1524
01:11:05,609 --> 01:11:07,741
So ain't no use
bitching about it.

1525
01:11:07,785 --> 01:11:09,482
[Noah] You know, we trained
to put the whole world

1526
01:11:09,526 --> 01:11:10,962
on our back.

1527
01:11:11,005 --> 01:11:12,659
At the end of the day,

1528
01:11:12,703 --> 01:11:14,139
the hardest thing was knocking
on a friend's door.

1529
01:11:16,968 --> 01:11:18,056
Bye, Lulu.

1530
01:11:18,099 --> 01:11:20,058
Say hi to your daddy for me.

1531

[panting and whining]

1532
01:11:21,407 --> 01:11:23,366
I'll be praying for you guys.

1533
01:11:23,409 --> 01:11:24,889
[Briggs] We're gonna
be just fine.

1534
01:11:26,238 --> 01:11:27,718
Come here.

1535
01:11:27,761 --> 01:11:28,893
-[Noah] Hello, guys.
-[indistinct chatter]

1536
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:42,167
[rainfall pattering]

1537
01:12:08,672 --> 01:12:10,064
I hope you're ready
for this tomorrow,

1538
01:12:10,108 --> 01:12:12,153
because you know
what they want, right?

1539
01:12:13,807 --> 01:12:18,638
They want the hero war dog
all sad and stoic,

1540
01:12:18,682 --> 01:12:21,206
just missing her
hero war daddy.

1541
01:12:23,774 --> 01:12:25,428
What they definitely
don't want...

1542
01:12:25,471 --> 01:12:27,560
They definitely don't want you
trying to eat everybody

1543
01:12:27,604 --> 01:12:29,954
as soon as the color guard
starts firing their salute.

1544
01:12:32,652 --> 01:12:33,958
Now, they...
They don't know you.

1545
01:12:34,828 --> 01:12:36,395
That's for damn sure.

1546
01:12:38,223 --> 01:12:39,964
They don't know
what it takes to be a hero.

1547
01:12:41,661 --> 01:12:43,968
The things you've done
to be a hero dog.

1548
01:12:45,448 --> 01:12:46,449
If they knew the truth,

1549
01:12:47,841 --> 01:12:51,541
it would scare the living shit
out of them.

1550
01:12:55,980 --> 01:12:58,069
You know, when I got out,

1551
01:12:58,112 --> 01:13:00,201
your daddy gave me
this shitty piece of plywood

1552
01:13:00,245 --> 01:13:02,378
with the word "Thanks"
carved in it. [chuckles]

1553
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:07,034
It's like, what else
do you say to somebody

1554
01:13:07,078 --> 01:13:09,776
that you experience
what we experienced together?

1555
01:13:12,649 --> 01:13:13,650
You even listening to me?

1556
01:13:15,652 --> 01:13:17,567
Just talking to a dog.

-[screeching]
-[Lulu whining]

1558
01:13:21,832 --> 01:13:23,094
What is that?

1559
01:13:23,137 --> 01:13:24,269
No. No, no.

1560
01:13:26,227 --> 01:13:27,011
No, no. Come on.

1561
01:13:28,229 --> 01:13:29,405
Don't you do this to me now.

1562
01:13:36,499 --> 01:13:37,456
No.

1563
01:13:39,676 --> 01:13:41,242
Ow. [grunts]

1564
01:13:44,332 --> 01:13:45,116

1565
01:13:46,944 --> 01:13:48,598
-Okay...
-[whines]

1566
01:13:48,641 --> 01:13:50,208
Of course, there's no service.

1567
01:13:50,251 --> 01:13:51,339
Why would we have service?

1568
01:13:53,516 --> 01:13:54,299
[growls softly]

1569
01:14:22,501 --> 01:14:23,241
Hey, hey, hey.

1570
01:14:26,766 --> 01:14:27,767
Hello?

1571
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:32,468
Hey.

1572
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,005
Come on.

1573
01:14:51,356 --> 01:14:53,489
All right, we got to go.

1574
01:14:53,532 --> 01:14:55,403
-Come on. We're moving on.
-[thunder rumbling]

1575
01:14:55,447 --> 01:14:56,753
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
-[Lulu barking]

1576
01:14:56,796 --> 01:14:58,842
Hey, hey, no.

1577
01:14:58,885 --> 01:15:00,757
No. Chill out.

1578
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:04,195
-[barking continues]
-Hey. Hey, hey!

1579
01:15:04,238 --> 01:15:06,110
No! Stop! Relax!

1580
01:15:06,153 --> 01:15:08,547
Look, stop. It's just thunder.

1581
01:15:08,591 --> 01:15:10,897
It's just a thunderstorm.
We gotta... Stop.

1582
01:15:11,768 --> 01:15:13,334
-Calm down. Stop!
-[growls]

1583
01:15:13,378 --> 01:15:14,945
Hey!

1584
01:15:14,988 --> 01:15:16,990
All right, you want to go?
Come on. Come on, then.

1585
01:15:17,034 --> 01:15:18,949
Come on,
you're not gonna do shit.

1586
01:15:20,211 --> 01:15:21,429
Come on, then, let's go!

1587
01:15:22,605 --> 01:15:25,564

[panting]

1589
01:15:31,657 --> 01:15:32,440
Such a coward.

[soft music playing]

1593
01:16:34,677 --> 01:16:37,244
Easy. I'm not gonna make you
go out there, okay?

1594
01:16:37,288 --> 01:16:39,246
How about we just chill out
for a little while?

1595
01:16:39,290 --> 01:16:40,508
Relax.

1596
01:16:40,552 --> 01:16:41,771
-[thunder rumbles]
-[whines]

1597
01:16:41,814 --> 01:16:43,424
Hey, it's okay.

1598
01:16:43,468 --> 01:16:44,991
It's just thunder
and a little lightning.

1599
01:16:46,689 --> 01:16:49,474
You know what? How about this?
Let me see if I can

1600
01:16:49,517 --> 01:16:52,129
give us a little something
to take our mind off.

1601
01:16:52,172 --> 01:16:54,479
Cross your paws.
Let's see if this thing works.

1602
01:16:54,522 --> 01:16:55,393
What do you feel like?

1603
01:16:57,047 --> 01:16:58,483
Who doesn't like
San Francisco?

1604
01:16:58,526 --> 01:17:00,050
You want to watch
your greatest hits,

1605
01:17:00,093 --> 01:17:01,486
or do you wanna watch...
Wanna watch Grey's?

1606
01:17:01,529 --> 01:17:02,705
I'm gonna go with Grey's.

1607
01:17:05,925 --> 01:17:07,535
[laughs] It works.

1608
01:17:11,539 --> 01:17:12,845
We're just gonna rest,

1609
01:17:12,889 --> 01:17:15,108
we're gonna get
a little cozy, relax.

1610
01:17:16,675 --> 01:17:17,720
[TV playing indistinctly]

1611
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:21,245
Watch a little trash TV.

1612
01:17:23,203 --> 01:17:25,684
A little snack 'cause
you can't watch trash TV

1613
01:17:25,728 --> 01:17:26,511
without a snack.

1614
01:17:29,122 --> 01:17:30,123
[thunder rumbling]

1615
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:32,430
What?

1616
01:17:33,910 --> 01:17:34,650
Oh, you want some?

1617
01:17:42,135 --> 01:17:43,920
[laughs] Look at that.

1618
01:17:45,835 --> 01:17:48,359
Who knew you just needed
to have a fight to get along?

1619
01:17:53,277 --> 01:17:54,495
Did Latin Shakespeare ever,

1620
01:17:54,539 --> 01:17:56,280
like, read you
his love letters?

1621
01:17:58,978 --> 01:18:00,153
Some pretty good ones
in there.

1622
01:18:03,417 --> 01:18:04,288
Let's see.

1623
01:18:08,118 --> 01:18:09,206
What about...

1624
01:18:10,816 --> 01:18:12,688
Okay. [chuckles]

1625
01:18:15,429 --> 01:18:20,696
"I woke for an instant when
I saw you covered in dirt.

1626
01:18:23,524 --> 01:18:24,874
You've taken bullets before.

1627
01:18:26,223 --> 01:18:27,485
This was the worst.

1628
01:18:30,009 --> 01:18:31,315
The guilt still haunts me.

1629
01:18:32,969 --> 01:18:34,971
I'm not going to lie,

1630
01:18:35,014 --> 01:18:37,451
but I know you did
what you did that night,

1631
01:18:37,495 --> 01:18:39,540
so none of your brothers
had to die."

1632
01:18:40,324 --> 01:18:41,499
It's pretty good.

01:18:44,589 --> 01:18:46,025
"When they took you away,

1634
01:18:46,069 --> 01:18:48,767
I was sure
we'd run out of time

1635
01:18:50,813 --> 01:18:52,249
and that's when
it hit me, girl,

1636
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:56,514
I was never your handler.

1637
01:18:59,212 --> 01:19:01,214
That you were actually mine.

1638
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:06,437
Your brother, Riley."

1639
01:19:09,048 --> 01:19:10,180
You slept with Corrine?

1640
01:19:11,268 --> 01:19:12,922
Yeah.

1641
01:19:12,965 --> 01:19:14,750

with my sick daughter?

I cannot believe
you actually like this trash.

1644
01:19:19,058 --> 01:19:20,625
Unreal.

01:19:20,668 --> 01:19:22,018
All right, the sun's up.

It's time.

1647
01:19:25,282 --> 01:19:28,764
There is about zero chance
of us making it

or ride.

But, hey, last time I checked,

1651
01:19:35,509 --> 01:19:37,468

is not a Ranger word.

Look, she's...
She's doing a lot better.

1737
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:49,056
I mean, she's a completely
different dog now.

1738
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:50,449
I don't know, maybe there's
someone on base

1739
01:25:50,493 --> 01:25:52,190
that one of us could talk to.

1740

that's not up to us.

I've been out here cooking
my ass off for an hour.

It could be worse.

[Levitz] All right, man.
I hear she's a real killer,

you muzzle her up good, okay?

you know, reevaluate her, give
her a chance.

You know what, I should have
put a vest on her.
