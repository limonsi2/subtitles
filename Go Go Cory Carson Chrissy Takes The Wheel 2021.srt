<i>Chrissy, look, ice cream!</i>

1077
00:49:55,875 --> 00:49:59,083
<i>The Tin Can Vans</i>
<i>have snatched the ball from the offense.</i>

1078
00:49:59,166 --> 00:50:02,708
<i>They are headed downfield.</i>
<i>Look at that fancy wheel work.</i>

1079
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:04,666
<i>Don't you dare!</i>

1080
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:05,666
<i>They take aim.</i>

1081
00:50:06,458 --> 00:50:09,750
<i>And goal!</i>
<i>It's a goal for the Tin Can Vans!</i>

1082
00:50:09,833 --> 00:50:12,250
<i>The Mean Greens are left in shock.</i>

1083
00:50:12,333 --> 00:50:14,541
<i>But they don't leave them</i>
<i>a second to celebrate.</i>

1084
00:50:14,625 --> 00:50:17,666
<i>Both teams are scrambling.</i>
<i>I can barely see the ball, folks!</i>

1085
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:19,125
<i>It's lost in the scuffle.</i>

1086
00:50:20,416 --> 00:50:22,583
<i>It's been found.</i>
<i>The Mean Greens have the ball.</i>

1087
00:50:22,666 --> 00:50:25,333
<i>We're off to the races!</i>
<i>What a beautiful maneuver.</i>

1088
00:50:25,416 --> 00:50:27,666
<i>Go, Mean Greens! Show 'em who's boss!</i>

1089
00:50:28,416 --> 00:50:31,000
<i>This kid's a regular twinkle-tires.</i>

1090
00:50:31,083 --> 00:50:33,666
<i>Ah-ha! And it's a goal for Green!</i>

1091
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:37,208
<i>The Vans manage to break away!</i>
<i>It looks like a clean--</i>

1092
00:50:37,291 --> 00:50:38,333
<i>Oh!</i>

1093
00:50:38,416 --> 00:50:40,416
<i>Wait a minute. What just happened?</i>

1094
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:43,541
<i>A fan has come onto the field.</i>
<i>He's stolen the ball!</i>

1095
00:50:43,625 --> 00:50:46,416
<i>-Huh?</i>
-Can someone get stadium security, please?

1096
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,625
<i>[all yelling]</i>

1097
00:50:48,708 --> 00:50:51,666
<i>Can no one get their tires</i>
<i>on the slippery suspect?</i>

1098
00:50:52,666 --> 00:50:54,916
<i>Oh, they got him. The fan is down!</i>

1099
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,250
<i>They're really giving him a walloping!</i>

1100
00:50:58,333 --> 00:50:59,208
<i>Yay!</i>

1101
00:50:59,708 --> 00:51:00,958
<i>On with the game!</i>

1102
00:51:01,041 --> 00:51:02,708
<i>[both growling]</i>

1103
00:51:03,291 --> 00:51:06,375
<i>The match is heating up.</i>
<i>There's no sign of it slowing down.</i>

1104
00:51:06,458 --> 00:51:07,458
<i>I'm working!</i>

1105
00:51:07,541 --> 00:51:09,291
<i>They're matching point for point.</i>

1106
00:51:09,375 --> 00:51:12,041
<i>And those victory dances</i>
<i>are nothing to sneeze at.</i>

1107
00:51:12,125 --> 00:51:13,958
<i>Oh yeah! Uh-huh! Oh yeah!</i>

1108
00:51:14,041 --> 00:51:16,791
<i>The walls are closing in.</i>
<i>There's nowhere left to turn.</i>

1109
00:51:16,875 --> 00:51:20,416
<i>But wait! A teammate is wide open.</i>
<i>Waiting in the wings like an angel.</i>

1110
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,291
<i>Henry, catch!</i>

1111
00:51:22,375 --> 00:51:25,250
<i>A beautiful pass.</i>
<i>And beautifully received.</i>

<i>It's another mad scramble.</i>
<i>The play goes haywire.</i>

1122
00:51:54,125 --> 00:51:56,208
<i>Cars are sent head over wheels.</i>

1123
00:51:56,291 --> 00:51:59,000
<i>The ball is in the air.</i>
<i>It's anyone's game.</i>

1124
00:51:59,083 --> 00:52:02,250
<i>[slowed down] Come on!</i>

1125
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:08,000
<i>It's all over, folks! It's a tie!</i>

<i>Juice?</i>

1130
00:52:18,291 --> 00:52:22,375
<i>Oh, there's only one left.</i>
<i>I'll go get some cups so we can split it.</i>

1131
