00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,083
I had a bottle of wine, but I drank it,

51
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:54,166

Jenn, Brian's here.

54
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,041
I know, I'm sorry. It's just--

55
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:03,958
Originally, you weren't coming,
and then Scott invited him,

56
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,500
and I had absolutely no idea. So…

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,583
Yeah, I could just…

58
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,708
tell everyone you're not feeling well,
you know?

59
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,291

Hey, I am so sorry.

Yes, yes, he is.

-You don't have to apologize.
-He does.

68
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,666
She told me a week ago
that you weren't coming.

00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,041
-It's her fault.
-Okay. Stop.

You don't know what's happening,

-Yes. I'm "The Jenn," apparently.

-Collin Meade. Very nice to meet you.
-[woman] He's magical. Changed my life.

I got the promotion, like,
a month after working with you?

00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,125
And this house.
You should totally go see him.

00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,208
Wow.

81
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,208

00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:19,166
-That's what you say, right?
-You know where the ice tongs are?

83
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,291
-It's by the ice bucket, Scott.
-[Scott] They're not there.

84
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:25,791
Babe. Seriously, every time!
I put them beside the ice thing.

It's not every time. [continues inaudibly]

could hang out with their clients.

I follow the rules 99% of the time.

-My new house!

94
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,625
So, Brian, how's Foghorn?

95
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:06,833
What's Foghorn?

96
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,208
-It's a stupid name, is what it is.
-No, what is it?

97
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:15,125
Uh, the guys created a new software
for some big audio engineer.

98
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,083
I just helped write some of the code.

99
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,708
What about you, Jennifer?

100
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:20,666
Oh, sorry. What?

101
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,041
Oh, no. I was just, uh--

102
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,333
What do you do?

103
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:30,041
I'm just-- Um, I'm sort of
in between jobs at the moment.

104
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:34,541
She's just being modest. Jenny is actually
a killer software engineer.

105
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,500
-Impressive.
-[Jenn] Mm-hmm.

106
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:39,541
-So, you two ever worked together?
-Brian!

107
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,750
Um… Is there sesame in that?

108
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:45,875
[gasps] Oh my God! Brian, I'm so sorry.

109
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,375
[Brian] It's okay. It's okay.

110
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:52,416
Wow, that would've sucked
if you died in our new house, dude.

112
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:58,250

I think I'm gonna leave this right here.

113
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,041
Just in case. [chuckles]

114
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,708

-Hm. Yes?

117
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,833
I'm headed out, but, uh,
I wanted to leave you this.

118
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:20,000
-In case you're interested.
-Okay.

119
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,250

Yeah?

130
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:03,541
I have tried really hard
not to bother you, but…

131
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,958
I think about you all the time,
and I just--

132
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:11,500
I miss you.

Yeah. I know--

136
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,916
Then don't say things like that.

137
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:25,083
When you say things like that,
you make me sound like the bad guy,

138
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,083
and I'm not the bad guy. I'm--

139
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,208
You're not the bad guy.
I'm not saying you are.

140
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:34,208
I'm just-- Oh God, what am I saying?
I don't know what I'm saying.

[Jenn sighs]

142
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,083
Can I give you a ride home?

143
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,333
-I don't think that's a good id--
-[Brian] It's just a ride, Jenny.

146
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:07,125
-Do you plan on getting back together?
-No.

147
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,916
I'm stupid. Oh God, I'm the most stupid.

148
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,666
Oh my gosh, you're not. You're not stupid.
You're just-- You're--

149
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,250
-You're unhappy.
-Yeah, everyone's unhappy.

150
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,458
No. I'm happy. Scott's happy.

151
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:25,375
And for the most part,
I hate to say this to you,

152
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:28,250
but Brian is happy.

153
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,833
What am I supposed to say to that?

154
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:34,041
[clicks tongue]
I think you should see Dr. Meade.

155
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,541
-Who's Dr. Meade?
-My therapist.

156
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,333
-Gina, I'll never do that.
-You met him. He's tall, handsome.

157
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:40,250
-No.
-Come on.

158
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:43,625
Hear me out, okay?
You're isolating. You're unemployed.

159
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,458
Don't pretend like you're not.

160
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,583
And you slept
with your ex-fiancé last night.

161
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:50,916
-Your life is a vortex of crap right now.
-This is so much fun.

162
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,875
Can you just go for me, please?

163
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,708
-Ugh, fine. Once.
-Great!

164
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,708
I made you an appointment for Friday.

167
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,166
You should've seen me
when I started with him.

168
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,375
Oh, sorry?

169
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,208
I pull my hair.

171
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,208
Oh.

172
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:11,583
Whatever you're here for,
Dr. Meade will fix it.

173
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,041
Yeah.

174
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,375
He's waiting for you.

175
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,250
Oh, okay. Um, yeah.

176
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,875
[water sloshing]

177
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:28,791
Wow, this is cozy.

178
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:29,958
Jennifer.

179
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,666
[chuckles] Just feeding the little guy.

180
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:37,458
You know that having fish
reduces stress and lowers blood pressure?

181
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,500
[Jenn] No, I didn't.

182
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:42,000
At least that's what I've heard.
Who knows if it's true.

183
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,750
But I do find them calming.

184
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,166
I'm so glad you decided to come in.

185
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,041
And here I am!

186
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:51,666
Please.

187
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:00,333
[thumps]

188
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:03,708
[Jenn] I don't feel motivated
to do anything.

189
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:07,166
Or, like, I should probably stop drinking.
I should probably exercise more.

190
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,375
I should probably
get eight hours of sleep at night.

191
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,250
Jennifer, um,

192
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,958
bad habits come from deeper issues.

193
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,791
There's always a root cause.

194
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,666
What might that be for you?

195
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:24,750
I don't know?

196
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,166
Was that a question?

197
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,333
Yes?

198
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,458
Tell me about you and Brian.

199
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:38,291
He's nice. He's sweet, he's funny,
he's smart. It's Brian. I don't know.

200
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,541
[inhales deeply]

201
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:46,291
[exhales] Okay. Fine. Um…

202
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,916
We met in college.

203
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,166
We lived together. We worked together.
It was like a whole thing.

204
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,958
[gloomy music]

205
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,333
I had a miscarriage.

206
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:06,000
Actually, I was six months along,
so it was a stillbirth.

207
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,250
[gloomy music builds]

208
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,875
His name was Daniel.

209
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,083
I got to spend 33 minutes with him.

210
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,958
Brian and I were engaged, and, uh,

211
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:29,458
you know, we just couldn't
really figure it out after that. So…

212
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,083
[inhales]

213
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,958
Do you have anything after this?

214
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:42,500
No.

215
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,583
Have you ever tried hypnotherapy?

216
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:49,208
[chuckles] No. No, I have not.

217
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,125
Why the judgment?

218
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:55,291
I'm just not a giving-away-control person,

219
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,000
so it's a pass.

220
00:13:57,083 --> 00:14:00,916
Sure. But here's the wonderful thing
about hypnotherapy. All right?

221
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,500
Only you can control your subconscious.

222
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,583
-[Jenn sighs]
-So, you're in control the whole time.

223
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:13,500
And it's an excellent tool
for people who have suffered…

224
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:15,666
trauma.

225
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:22,375
Worst case scenario, it'll stop you
from further destroying your poor fingers.

226
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,166
[sighs] I don't know.

227
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,666
I had a mentor,

228
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:34,916
and his name was, uh, Dr. Xavier Sullivan.

229
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,250
He was a brilliant mind. He would say,

230
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:41,000
"Prosaic methods are reserved
for the unimaginative."

231
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:46,541
"One in search of lasting results
dares to open the mind."

232
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,375
[Jenn] Hm.

233
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,125
-[Meade] Jennifer?
-[Jenn exhales]

234
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:53,791
What do you want?

235
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:59,333
Just wanna be happy again, you know?

236
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,000
Then let me help you.

237
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,625
I want you to concentrate on the light.

238
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,791
[lights droning]

239
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:21,333
[Meade] Feel the weight of your body
as it melts into the couch,

240
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,583
muscle by muscle.

241
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,500
Starting at the toes,

242
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,333
the arches of the feet.

243
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:31,541
[droning intensifies]

244
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:34,625
[Meade] Calves. Thighs.

245
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:36,833
All the way up,

246
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:41,125
until you arrive at the top of your head.

247
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,041
Now,

248
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,125
I want you to find yourself

249
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,166
in a beautiful forest.

250
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,125
[loud droning continues]

251
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,583
[birds calling]

252
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,250
[droning stops]

253
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,041
[roller shades whir]

254
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,041
That was an hour?

255
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,458
It felt like three minutes.

256
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:25,666
How do you feel?

257
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:29,375
[sighs] I don't know.
I don't really remember anything.

258
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:31,541
How'd I do?

259
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:35,458
I think you might be
more open to suggestibility

260
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,416
than you imagined.

261
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:39,958
[chuckles]

262
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,000
[tranquil music]

263
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,833
-[indistinct chatter]
-[elevator dings]

264
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,916
[phone chiming]

265
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:05,708
[Jenn] That was bizarre.

266
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,375
They called me right after I left.
I start in two weeks.

267
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:14,208
Are you gonna do some yoga with me,
or you're just gonna lie there?

268
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:15,958
This is Shavasana. It is yoga.

269
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:17,958
[sighs]

270
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,125
How many sessions did you have
with Dr. Meade?

271
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:24,333
I don't know. Maybe, um, once a week
for about three months now.

272
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,833
I've asked him to do hypnosis twice.

273
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,416
It's not fair.
I wanna conquer all of my fears.

274
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,000
It's a compliment.
You've already conquered all your fears.

275
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,541
Hi, have you seen me and spiders?
Didn't think so.

276
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,166
I'm really proud of you.

277
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
[ominous music]

278
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,458
-[birds calling]
-[wind gusting]

279
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,375
[whispers] You're perfect.

280
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
[light gasp]

281
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,375
[indistinct chatter]

282
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:32,041
[pop music playing over speakers]

283
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,416
[woman chuckles]

284
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:49,625
Jennifer?

285
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,000
-Hi.
-[chuckling] Hi.

286
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,416
-You look fantastic as ever.
-Oh, thanks. You too.

287
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Haven't seen you in a couple of weeks.
You're not, uh… you're not avoiding me?

288
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:03,416
Oh, no. I've been meaning to schedule.
It's just I've been busy--

289
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,958
-Sure.
-Oh…

290
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,791
I got the job.

291
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,541
-What? Really?
-Yeah, I did.

292
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,916
-I had no doubt.
-You didn't think I could do it?

293
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,375
No. I never doubted you.

294
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,041
[both laugh]

295
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:18,833
May I buy you a celebratory coffee?

296
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:22,708
Yeah, okay.

297
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:23,875
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

298
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:30,041
I did yoga with Gina,
and I meditated last night.

299
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,000
Amazing.

300
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:34,666
It was three minutes, and I thought
about my dead plants, but I did it.

301
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,500
-Progress. Not perfection.
-You can't say that.

302
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:40,000
You're one of those people
that wakes up at 5:00 a.m.

303
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,083
-and you're perfect at everything.
-Hardly.

304
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:45,666
And one of those who hangs out
with his clients but is very private.

305
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,125
[chuckles]

306
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,250
[smooth jazz playing over speakers]

307
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:52,875
All right.

308
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,041
I'll play.

309
00:19:57,458 --> 00:20:00,416
I'm 46. Only child. [clicks tongue]

310
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:06,125
Uh, I was married once
to the love of my life, Amy.

311
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:11,125
We were happy, but she died.

312
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,333
I'm so sorry.

313
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:14,958
What do they say?

314
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,125
"Wanna make God laugh,
tell him your plans."

315
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:21,166
But, Jennifer,
the important thing to remember

316
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,375
is that being a victim is a choice,

317
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,583
and we can let our hardships define us,

318
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:30,333
consume us, or we can accept

319
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:34,125
the extraordinary abilities
that we have in this life

320
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,250
to create the outcome we choose.

321
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,833
-For ourselves. May I?
-Mm.

322
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:43,916
[tense music]

323
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:47,291
[chuckling] Eyelash.

324
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,750
-[smooth jazz continues over speakers]
-Thank you.

325
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,125
All right, well, enough about me. Um…

326
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:55,000
So, last we spoke,
you were struggling a bit with Brian.

327
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,166
How's it going there?

328
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,791
I don't know. I have been avoiding him.

329
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,791
When you see Brian, uh,

330
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,041
is it hard for you?

331
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,041
Yeah.

332
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,625
Have you considered telling him this?

333
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,208
And if you did?

334
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:18,416
He may be hurt because we still care
about each other a lot.

335
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:23,416
Let me suggest something,
and you can take it or leave it,

336
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,208
but I think you'd be wise to take it.
[chuckles]

337
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:27,333
Okay.

338
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,958
Invite Brian to your place
for dinner tonight.

339
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,791
-No.
-[Meade] Why not?

340
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,791
I can think of infinite reasons why not.

341
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:37,125
Trust me. You'll be on your turf.
You can cook a good meal.

342
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:39,833
Tell him you got
some matters you need to discuss.

343
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,750
I think it'd be very good for you.

344
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:46,791
But not easy.
I mean, I'm not saying that. But--

345
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:48,333
But good.

346
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:51,708
'Cause, Jennifer,

347
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,291
you don't have to be a victim anymore.

348
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,000
[phone chimes]

349
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:09,958
[Brian] Hey, it's Brian.
I got your message.

350
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,833
Yeah, uh, I'll be there.

351
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:15,291
Let me know if you want me
to bring anything. See you soon.

352
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:19,166
[phone chiming]

353
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:23,166
Hello?

354
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,041
[whoosh]

355
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,125
[eerie ringing]

356
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:32,458
[clock ticking]

357
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:34,541
[eerie music]

358
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:48,541
[inhales]

359
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,500
[eerie music turns menacing]

360
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:02,958
[choking in the distance]

361
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:06,208
[clock ticking]

362
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:08,250
[choking continues]

363
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:11,875
[menacing music intensifies]

364
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:15,666
[choking continues]

365
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:20,041
[fast-paced clock ticking]

366
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:28,791
Hey, hey, hey! [sniffles]

367
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:29,750
Where's your pen?

368
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:32,333
Where's your--

369
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:34,291
[pen clicks]

370
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,375
[siren wailing]

371
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:44,208
[monitor beeping]

372
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:56,750
[Gina] Hey.

373
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,750
[siren wailing]

374
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:06,750
It was an accident, Jenn.

375
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:11,125
I mean, I almost killed him
at our housewarming party.

376
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:12,666
You're the one who caught it.

377
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:15,500
I can't remember anything.

378
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:19,791
-You're probably just in shock.
-No, I'm not in shock.

379
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:21,625
I'm serious. I--

380
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,000
I remember being at the store.

381
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:30,500
And then I'm at home sitting at the table.

382
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:37,458
Come on. I'm gonna--
I'm gonna take you home.

383
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:45,291
[Meade] How's Brian?

384
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:49,458
Sorry?

385
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:53,375
Brian. How is he?

386
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,333
He's the same.

387
00:24:57,666 --> 00:25:00,000
-[Meade] How long has it been now?
-Eight days.

388
00:25:04,291 --> 00:25:05,375
[Meade inhales]

389
00:25:05,458 --> 00:25:08,041
Do you remember
anything else from that night?

390
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:14,416
Is there any way
that I could be responsible

391
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,250
for what happened that night?

392
00:25:17,791 --> 00:25:19,083
[Meade] Why do you ask?

393
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:21,666
Because I can't stop thinking about it.

394
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,416
The way it felt,

395
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:26,916
and the missing time.

396
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,458
It's like what we do here.

397
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:30,750
[Meade] Hm.

398
00:25:31,666 --> 00:25:36,083
[inhales] Do you remember what I told you
the first time we discussed hypnosis?

399
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:41,166
That only you have the power,
control over your subconscious.

400
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:46,166
-Yeah, but--
-[Meade] Jennifer, listen to me.

401
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,125
We all have these wounds,

402
00:25:51,041 --> 00:25:55,750
and every time we let the world run us,
those wounds fester.

403
00:25:56,625 --> 00:26:01,708
But that's a choice
based on some preconceived notion

404
00:26:01,791 --> 00:26:05,458
that the world
can even run us in the first place.

405
00:26:06,791 --> 00:26:07,791
It's ego.

406
00:26:09,208 --> 00:26:11,833
Ego derived from fear.

407
00:26:12,583 --> 00:26:13,416
You follow?

408
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:20,041
So, the work we're doing
is designed to eliminate that fear,

409
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:23,791
but the moment
you start to doubt our work,

410
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:25,208
fear wins.

411
00:26:27,166 --> 00:26:28,416
Is that what you want?

412
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:30,416
To let fear win?

413
00:26:32,541 --> 00:26:33,375
No.

414
00:26:35,708 --> 00:26:37,083
So you need to trust me…

415
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:40,416
and keep doing the work.

416
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:49,125
-[soft brooding music]
-[clock ticking]

417
00:27:00,416 --> 00:27:01,541
[gasps]

418
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:03,625
[music crescendos]

419
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,750
[noise stops]

420
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:38,583
[ominous music]

421
00:27:51,958 --> 00:27:53,125
[phone chimes]

422
00:27:58,833 --> 00:27:59,666
Hello?

423
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:01,458
[Meade] Jennifer,

424
00:28:02,416 --> 00:28:03,375
carry the fire.

425
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:06,208
[clock ticking continuously]

426
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:18,291
[coughs]

427
00:28:19,375 --> 00:28:20,291
[coughs]

428
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:23,958
[coughing continues]

429
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:27,125
-[fast-paced clock ticking]
-[ominous music crescendos]

430
00:28:36,958 --> 00:28:38,958
[adventurous music]

431
00:28:42,958 --> 00:28:45,541
[newswoman]
This is a terrible turn of events,

432
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:48,416
as the family is reeling
after losing their daughter,

433
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,500
and they still have no information
from police.

434
00:28:50,583 --> 00:28:52,958
[newsman] …and in Portland,
there's an investigation

435
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:55,291
into the death of their daughter.

436
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:59,041
She'd recently taken out
a restraining order on her psychiatrist.

437
00:28:59,125 --> 00:29:02,125
Of course, it's been
a game-changer to the entire case

438
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:06,333
as the police are now looking towards
finding out further information as what…

439
00:29:06,416 --> 00:29:07,666
[continues indistinctly]

440
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,250
[newsman 2]
The study into crimes while under hypnosis

441
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:12,375
is new to the state criminal court.

442
00:29:12,458 --> 00:29:14,541
There are currently board psychiatrists…

443
00:29:14,625 --> 00:29:16,833
[overlapping news reports]

444
00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:20,250
[mouse clicking]

445
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:21,500
[printer whirring]

446
00:29:23,916 --> 00:29:27,333
[sighs] I don't know, Jenn. It's just--
I get why you'd be concerned.

447
00:29:27,416 --> 00:29:31,375
I mean, it's not exactly comforting news,
but I just-- I don't see it.

448
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:33,583
No, look. It says here in the article,

449
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:36,333
"Bowen told her family
she was experiencing missing time."

450
00:29:36,416 --> 00:29:39,916
That is what happened to me.
It was after I had lunch with Dr. Meade,

451
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,041
where he suggested
I had Brian over for dinner.

452
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:45,250
-It just feels like a big leap.
-Look at the background check.

453
00:29:45,916 --> 00:29:47,166
You ran a background check?

454
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:50,375
Yes. Look,
the only address listed is his office.

455
00:29:50,458 --> 00:29:53,833
There's no private residence,
employers, or unpaid parking tickets.

456
00:29:53,916 --> 00:29:56,750
The man is basically a ghost
until six months ago

457
00:29:56,833 --> 00:30:00,166
when someone takes out
a restraining order. This is his patient,

458
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,541
and he is torturing her. Stalking.

459
00:30:02,625 --> 00:30:04,875
Psychological abuse, emotional abuse.

460
00:30:04,958 --> 00:30:06,833
Maybe she was crazy.

461
00:30:08,416 --> 00:30:10,291
This woman was afraid for her life,

462
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:13,791
and then three days
after she files a restraining order,

463
00:30:13,875 --> 00:30:14,791
she's dead.

464
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:16,000
She had a heart attack.

465
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:19,333
What if there is something else going on?

466
00:30:22,041 --> 00:30:25,375
-What if he did something to her?
-Okay. This is where you lose me.

467
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:29,625
Therapists use hypnotherapy
to help their patients quit smoking.

468
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:32,333
Not to hack into their brains
and stop their heart.

469
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:35,708
-This is not a thing.
-Yes, it-- Look, I thought that too.

470
00:30:35,791 --> 00:30:39,000
In Sweden, a group of teenagers
are hypnotized to deal drugs,

471
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:40,666
and they experienced blackouts.

472
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:44,291
In Germany, Zebediah Cantor is hypnotized
to rob banks, and he has missing time--

473
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:45,666
Okay, I get it.

474
00:30:57,416 --> 00:30:59,875
And this is from that night with Brian.

475
00:31:08,958 --> 00:31:10,625
He called me, Gina.

476
00:31:12,041 --> 00:31:13,625
Right before I blacked out.

477
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:16,000
Dr. Meade?

478
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,958
I remember everything now.

479
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:26,291
I did it on purpose, Gina.

480
00:31:26,375 --> 00:31:29,291
It-- But it wasn't me. It was, it was--

481
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:31,333
But I did do it.

482
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:36,416
And then I just sat there and watched.

483
00:31:39,666 --> 00:31:41,208
I didn't do anything.

484
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:43,416
I didn't get help.

485
00:31:45,541 --> 00:31:48,958
I didn't even move until I came out of it.

486
00:31:52,708 --> 00:31:54,666
I'm not crazy. [exhales]

487
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,166
So, what do we do?

488
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:05,875
[siren wailing in the distance]

489
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:09,458
Hey.

490
00:32:10,458 --> 00:32:14,250
Thank you so much for meeting with us,
detective, on such short notice.

491
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:17,416
-We really appreciate it.
-What can I do for you?

492
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,708
We wanted to ask you some questions
about a woman named Andrea Bowen.

493
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,666
Uh-huh.

494
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:28,791
Six months ago, she filed
a restraining order against Collin Meade.

495
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:31,083
I know the case. What's your question?

496
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:33,541
Her family said
that she died of a heart attack,

497
00:32:33,625 --> 00:32:36,541
but then they wanted
a broader investigation.

498
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:39,250
Did that investigation ever happen?

499
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:40,583
Why are you asking?

500
00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:43,250
Because Dr. Meade is our therapist.

501
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,541
Something strange is happening.

502
00:32:49,041 --> 00:32:50,416
Strange how?

503
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:52,375
I've been having

504
00:32:53,958 --> 00:32:54,875
weird dreams.

505
00:32:54,958 --> 00:32:56,708
But they don't feel like dreams.

506
00:32:57,375 --> 00:33:00,166
You've been practicing hypnosis
with Dr. Meade, Miss Thompson?

507
00:33:01,583 --> 00:33:02,750
Huh.

508
00:33:03,833 --> 00:33:05,916
Collin Meade
was brought in for questioning

509
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,458
a week after Bowen's death.

510
00:33:08,166 --> 00:33:09,416
Got us nowhere.

511
00:33:09,958 --> 00:33:11,541
I wanted to keep digging.

512
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:14,125
I got a warrant,
obtained his patient records.

513
00:33:14,208 --> 00:33:15,125
Didn't matter.

514
00:33:15,708 --> 00:33:17,250
Got shut down that day.

515
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:20,333
Told I couldn't even
finish going through what we had.

516
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:21,541
Why?

517
00:33:23,041 --> 00:33:25,750
Meade was also
practicing hypnosis with Andrea.

518
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:28,958
It's funny.
Cops using old witnesses sometimes.

519
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:32,291
Try and get them to remember things
they may have seen. [clicks tongue]

520
00:33:32,791 --> 00:33:34,000
If it works,

521
00:33:35,791 --> 00:33:37,541
it becomes evidence in court,

522
00:33:38,458 --> 00:33:41,541
but if you're a victim,
claiming someone used hypnosis

523
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:45,708
with ill intent, that kinda thing,
they'll laugh you out of the room.

524
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:47,708
You don't think
she died of a heart attack?

525
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:52,541
Oh my God!

526
00:33:57,625 --> 00:33:59,041
[detective] And then there's this.

527
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:03,333
Incoming call came from a blocked number.

528
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:06,875
-Her behavior changed when she answered.
-That happened to me.

529
00:34:07,458 --> 00:34:08,708
What is she doing?

530
00:34:09,958 --> 00:34:11,541
You ever heard of "quiescence"?

531
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:12,958
No.

532
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:16,125
It's the body's reaction to extreme fear.

533
00:34:16,916 --> 00:34:19,708
The body enters paralysis,
heart rate increases,

534
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,416
breathing intensifies.

535
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:23,708
But if it goes on too long, you die.

536
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:27,583
Maybe, technically,
she died of a heart attack,

537
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:31,333
but whatever she was seeing
in the elevator is what caused it.

538
00:34:31,916 --> 00:34:33,375
So, what do I think?

539
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:39,041
I think you should find yourselves
a new therapist.

540
00:34:47,083 --> 00:34:48,791
I'll talk to you later, okay?

541
00:34:49,541 --> 00:34:50,375
Yeah.

542
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:54,833
Jenn?

543
00:34:57,833 --> 00:34:59,416
He hypnotized me.

544
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,583
What?

545
00:35:03,791 --> 00:35:04,625
When?

546
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:06,208
This week.

547
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:08,791
We talked about you, I--

548
00:35:09,958 --> 00:35:13,500
It's just-- You were so worried
that something happened with Brian,

549
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:15,125
and then he just--

550
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:19,666
He said he was wrong before,
and then he thought that it might help me.

551
00:35:21,625 --> 00:35:23,000
It's okay, it's okay.

552
00:35:23,083 --> 00:35:25,416
We'll do what Det. Rollins said.
We'll stay away.

553
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:33,083
We'll figure this out, okay?

554
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:46,666
Hey, Dr. Meade, it's Jennifer Thompson.
We just saw each other,

555
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:50,208
but I was wondering if you had
any last-minute appointments available.

556
00:35:51,041 --> 00:35:53,166
Call me back when you can. Bye.

557
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,250

[door opens]

559
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:18,291
Jennifer. Please, come in.

560
00:36:20,666 --> 00:36:24,083
-I was thrilled to get your call.
-Yeah, thanks for squeezing me in.

561
00:36:25,791 --> 00:36:30,250
Was there something in particular
you wanted to talk about?

562
00:36:31,125 --> 00:36:35,500
No. Not-- Nothing really, actually.
It's just, um,

563
00:36:36,791 --> 00:36:38,166
a general anxiety.

564
00:36:39,291 --> 00:36:40,333
[Meade] Mm-hmm.

565
00:36:41,375 --> 00:36:44,833
Brian's not awake yet, and so that's hard.

566
00:36:45,416 --> 00:36:46,375
Yeah.

567
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:52,000
I thought just a bit
of hypnosis might help?

568
00:36:54,208 --> 00:36:55,166
Of course.

569
00:36:57,125 --> 00:36:58,041
Okay.

570
00:37:00,708 --> 00:37:02,916

[Wade inhales]

573
00:37:53,666 --> 00:37:54,916
[Wade] Lillian Dorsey.

574
00:37:58,708 --> 00:38:00,916
Date of death, 11/27/2019.

575
00:38:03,375 --> 00:38:06,833
-[phone line trilling]
-[Wade] I'm looking for Adrienne Dorsey.

576
00:38:06,916 --> 00:38:09,500
This is Detective Wade Rollins
with the Portland PD.

577
00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:13,083
I was hoping I could ask you
some questions regarding your sister.

578
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:16,750
Date of death, June 15, 2018. Hypnosis.

579
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:18,375
Andrea Bowen. Hypnosis.

580
00:38:24,083 --> 00:38:26,083
[inquisitive music fades out]

581
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:29,541
[Meade on recording]
Was there something in particular

582
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:31,291
you wanted to talk about?

583
00:38:32,041 --> 00:38:35,333
[Jenn] I thought just a bit
of hypnosis might help?

584
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:37,000
[Meade] Of course.

585
00:38:38,333 --> 00:38:40,166
[fast-forwarding]

586
00:38:40,666 --> 00:38:41,708
[Meade] Jennifer?

587
00:38:42,291 --> 00:38:44,166
-[Jenn] Yes?
-[Meade] Are you under?

588
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,791
-[Jenn] Yes.
-[Meade] Good.

589
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:50,666
I'm going to ask you some questions,
and you're gonna tell me the truth.

590
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:54,083
Why did you really come see me today?

591
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:55,666
[Jenn] To record you.

592
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
[Meade] Are you recording me now?

593
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:00,000
[Jenn] Yes.

594
00:39:00,916 --> 00:39:03,750
-[Meade] And why are you recording me?
-[menacing music]

595
00:39:03,833 --> 00:39:07,250
[Jenn] Because I want to hear
what happens during our sessions.

596
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:10,000
-[Meade] Do you not trust me?
-[Jenn] No.

597
00:39:10,708 --> 00:39:12,041
[Meade] Hmm.

598
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:14,416
Why not?

599
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,083
[Jenn] Because I know about Andrea Bowen.

600
00:39:19,083 --> 00:39:21,666
[Meade] Is this why you were
at the police station this morning?

601
00:39:22,791 --> 00:39:23,791
[Jenn] Yes.

602
00:39:25,625 --> 00:39:26,875
[Meade] You were with Gina.

603
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:30,625
I assume she knows everything you know.

604
00:39:31,125 --> 00:39:32,833
-[Jenn] Yes.
-[Meade] Yes.

605
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:35,750
Thank you for being honest, my love.

-[Gina] Tell him to not--

608
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:48,083
No, they are not up
by seven, bro! [laughs]

609
00:39:48,166 --> 00:39:50,750
-I'm serious. Hang up.
-I gotta go before she kills me.

-See?
-No, it's Jenn!

612
00:39:54,375 --> 00:39:58,208
Tell him I told him wassup!
Keep me informed. Yeah, okay, peace.

613
00:39:59,541 --> 00:40:02,291
Girl, I gotta call you back.
I have buyers calling any minute.

615
00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:07,083
-Gina. Gina, where are you?
-I'm just in the car with Scott.

616
00:40:07,166 --> 00:40:09,000
-[Scott] Hey, Jenny.
-Where are you?

617
00:40:09,083 --> 00:40:10,416
We just left the house.

618
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,250
Turn around and go back to the house.

619
00:40:12,333 --> 00:40:13,833
-I'm coming to you.
-What? Why?

620
00:40:13,916 --> 00:40:17,208
Could you go back to the house?
You need to go back, listen to me.

621
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:20,375
-Gina, get--
-I'm sorry, you're cutting out. I can't--

623
00:40:21,625 --> 00:40:23,208
This is them. I'll call you back.

624
00:40:23,291 --> 00:40:27,000
No, Gina! He knows we were
at the police station. He knows!

[phone hangs up]

626

This is Gina.

631
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,416
[Meade] Gina, it's Dr. Meade.

632
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,041
Sorry to bother you,
but do you have a moment to chat?

633
00:40:49,625 --> 00:40:51,291
I'm just in the car with Scott.

634
00:40:51,375 --> 00:40:54,541

-Get what off?
-Get it off. Please!

644
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,541
What? There's nothing there. Get what off?

645
00:41:18,625 --> 00:41:20,958
-Get it off of me! Please!
-Gina, relax. Gina!

646
00:41:21,041 --> 00:41:23,416

661
00:43:25,125 --> 00:43:27,541
-Her husband too.
-You're kidding me.

00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,708
Oh my God.

663
00:43:33,666 --> 00:43:35,125
How long was she a patient?

664
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:38,416
[Meade] I don't know. Maybe…

[tense music continues]

671
00:43:52,583 --> 00:43:53,458
[Wade] Hmm.

672
00:43:54,875 --> 00:43:58,333
You ever perform hypnosis on Gina?

673
00:43:58,416 --> 00:44:01,708
Yes. Uh, we performed
our first session last week.

674
00:44:01,791 --> 00:44:03,583
Started small, you know?

675
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:06,791
-Explored her common phobia.
-Claustrophobia?

676
00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:08,000
Arachnophobia.

677
00:44:10,083 --> 00:44:14,291
The last claustrophobic patient
I dealt with was, uh…

678
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,583
Well, it was Andrea Bowen, actually.

679
00:44:19,083 --> 00:44:20,083
[Wade] Hmm.

00:44:21,791 --> 00:44:23,583

I'm sure it has something to do
with why I became a detective.

Putting the pieces together,
finding the patterns.

685
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:36,708
That was always the key.

686
00:44:37,666 --> 00:44:38,625
Patterns.

687
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:42,416
I looked through
some of your patient files today.

688
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:46,000
The ones we obtained after Andrea's death.

689
00:44:47,541 --> 00:44:50,208
I got to chat with family members,
and I noticed something.

690
00:44:51,083 --> 00:44:52,000
A pattern.

691
00:44:53,666 --> 00:44:56,208
You don't use hypnotherapy
on all of your patients.

692
00:44:58,166 --> 00:44:59,666
Just a few, actually.

693
00:45:01,333 --> 00:45:02,750

697
00:45:11,541 --> 00:45:13,708
and they also all happen to be dead.

698
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:16,791
You ever noticed that?

699
00:45:17,958 --> 00:45:18,958
That pattern?

00:45:30,333 --> 00:45:33,291
I think you had something else in mind
when it came to her.

704
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:37,125
Is there something specific
you wanted to talk about tonight, Wade?

705
00:45:37,208 --> 00:45:38,166
[Wade sighs]

706
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:40,583
Because if not, I should be going.
It's getting late.

707
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:43,333
[Wade] It's Detective Rollins.

708
00:45:44,958 --> 00:45:47,416
-Thanks for the booze.
-[Meade] Oh, Wade.

709
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:51,291
Hypnotherapy works wonders for insomnia.

710
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,125
You wanna try it?
I'll give you a free session.

711
00:45:54,208 --> 00:45:56,416
Thought you only took female patients.

712
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,041
I'll make an exception.

713
00:45:59,083 --> 00:46:01,083
[tense music continues]

714
00:46:04,375 --> 00:46:05,375
[door shuts]

715
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,416
[music fades]

716
00:46:12,916 --> 00:46:14,333
[gentle knocking on door]

717
00:46:21,916 --> 00:46:23,583
My phone died, or I would have called.

718
00:46:24,458 --> 00:46:26,458
[gloomy music]

719
00:46:27,833 --> 00:46:29,750
Um, I heard about your friend.

720
00:46:31,083 --> 00:46:35,833
I just thought I could catch him
saying something or doing something.

721
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
He was at the station.
He's been following us.

722
00:46:41,458 --> 00:46:42,583
He's smart.

723
00:46:43,625 --> 00:46:44,958
Always a step ahead.

724
00:46:46,125 --> 00:46:49,958
There's a reason he never hypnotized Gina
until you started asking questions.

725
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:53,208
He knew you would go to her.
She got in the way.

726
00:46:54,416 --> 00:46:56,041
You can't blame yourself, Jenn.

727
00:46:56,666 --> 00:46:58,125
And just why me?

728
00:46:58,625 --> 00:46:59,750
Well, I don't know.

729
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,208
But not long after Andrea
started asking questions,

730
00:47:04,833 --> 00:47:06,000
she was dead.

731
00:47:07,333 --> 00:47:10,375
He's not done with you yet,
or you would be too.

732
00:47:13,666 --> 00:47:17,666
I got his prints. I'm gonna run 'em,
see if we're missing anything.

733
00:47:18,833 --> 00:47:20,500
I should know more tomorrow.

734
00:47:21,583 --> 00:47:22,583
For now,

735
00:47:23,583 --> 00:47:24,500
lay low.

736
00:47:24,583 --> 00:47:25,791
[door clicks open]

737
00:47:26,416 --> 00:47:27,416
[Jenn] Detective.

738
00:47:28,458 --> 00:47:29,375
Thank you.

739
00:47:30,458 --> 00:47:31,916
Try and get some rest.

740
00:47:32,708 --> 00:47:34,166
I'll call you in the morning.

741
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:41,750
[sighs]

742
00:47:55,333 --> 00:47:56,750
[chair scraping]

743
00:48:02,666 --> 00:48:04,250
[knocking on door]

744
00:48:05,958 --> 00:48:07,500
Did you forget something?

745
00:48:07,583 --> 00:48:08,500
Hello, Jennifer.

746
00:48:08,583 --> 00:48:10,083
[dramatic music]

747
00:48:11,916 --> 00:48:13,250
Jennifer, stop!

748
00:48:13,333 --> 00:48:14,833
-[whoosh]
-[music fades]

749
00:48:15,333 --> 00:48:16,416
[exhales sharply]

750
00:48:18,166 --> 00:48:19,166
[door clicks shut]

751
00:48:21,291 --> 00:48:22,375
[inhales]

752
00:48:22,458 --> 00:48:25,916
You don't need to be afraid of me.
I just wanna talk.

753
00:48:28,708 --> 00:48:32,291
What did I do to you
to make you not trust me?

754
00:48:32,916 --> 00:48:33,916
Huh?

755
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,791
[firmly] Think about it.

756
00:48:37,541 --> 00:48:39,333
I invited you in. I listened.

757
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,500
Really, you should be thanking me.

758
00:48:43,833 --> 00:48:47,958
I asked you what you wanted,
and I'm working so hard to give you that.

759
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:50,458
[ominous music]

760
00:48:53,791 --> 00:48:57,708
And Brian and Gina were just gonna
get in the way of your dreams.

761
00:48:57,791 --> 00:48:59,416
And now Rollins.

762
00:49:01,125 --> 00:49:03,125
[Jenn breathes shakily]

763
00:49:03,208 --> 00:49:05,541
Don't worry. He'll be taken care of.

764
00:49:06,416 --> 00:49:10,208
Everything I'm doing is for you, Jennifer.

765
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:14,041
And I know there's been a lot of

766
00:49:15,083 --> 00:49:18,708
build-up and anticipation, but…

767
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:22,541
that's just the romantic in me.

768
00:49:23,041 --> 00:49:25,041
[ominous music continues]

769
00:49:27,333 --> 00:49:30,000
-It's almost over.
-[Jenn shudders]

770
00:49:34,291 --> 00:49:35,791
[quietly] You're so close.

771
00:49:42,708 --> 00:49:43,583
Hmm?

772
00:49:49,708 --> 00:49:51,291
I'll see you soon, okay?

773
00:49:53,916 --> 00:49:55,958
Oh, Jennifer…

774
00:49:56,708 --> 00:49:58,416
-Relax.
-[Jenn gasps]

775
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,500
[panting]

776
00:50:00,583 --> 00:50:02,583
[music turns thrilling]

777
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:06,625
[continues panting]

778
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:15,958
[quietly] Pick up. Pick up.

779
00:50:16,625 --> 00:50:18,500
[Wade] This is Detective Wade Rollins--

780
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:19,875
Come on, come on.

781
00:50:40,041 --> 00:50:41,208
[sighs]

782
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:46,791
[woman on TV]
When the police ran his prints,

783
00:50:46,875 --> 00:50:50,416
they discovered his real identity.
He had changed his name.

784
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,375
[man on TV] And who was he, really?

785
00:50:52,458 --> 00:50:55,416
[woman] A killer.
Wanted for murder in three states.

786
00:50:55,916 --> 00:50:57,916
[distant creaking]

[hinges creak]

790
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,500
[male narrator]
Tonight, on The Crime Files.

791
00:51:56,583 --> 00:51:58,666
In the fall of 2014,

792
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:02,875
seventeen-year-old Victoria Wilson
disappeared from her suburban home

793
00:52:02,958 --> 00:52:04,541
in Metuchen, New Jersey,

794
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:07,250
leaving her parents
and four younger siblings

795
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:09,500
heartbroken and terrified.

796
00:52:09,583 --> 00:52:14,416
Three days later, her body was found
in a forest 300 miles from home.

797
00:52:15,083 --> 00:52:17,541
So, what happened to Victoria Wilson?

798
00:52:19,083 --> 00:52:21,125
Billy Adler came home from school

799
00:52:21,208 --> 00:52:23,916
to find his mom dead
at the dining room table,

800
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,500
shot in the head.

801
00:52:25,583 --> 00:52:29,166
The police ruled it a suicide.
But Billy knew his mom would nev--

802
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:30,291
[woman gasps]

803
00:52:30,375 --> 00:52:32,166
[screams]

804
00:52:32,875 --> 00:52:35,125
[both grunting and groaning]

805
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:43,625
[Wade groans]

806
00:52:44,041 --> 00:52:45,916
[both grunting]

807
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,250
[Wade screams]

808
00:52:51,333 --> 00:52:52,541
[grunts]

809
00:52:54,166 --> 00:52:56,708
[grunting and groaning continue]

810
00:53:09,125 --> 00:53:10,291
[Wade grunts]

811
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:12,958
[groans]

812
00:53:26,166 --> 00:53:28,666
I can't tell them
I think Meade was involved.

813
00:53:29,333 --> 00:53:31,291
They don't know
I've been digging into this.

814
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:32,625
[monitor beeping]

815
00:53:33,458 --> 00:53:35,208
I'm so sorry, Rollins.

816
00:53:35,708 --> 00:53:37,708
[indistinct announcement over PA]

817
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,583
You read 'em?

818
00:53:44,833 --> 00:53:45,791
And?

819
00:53:47,458 --> 00:53:48,833
And I have an idea.

820
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:53,666
When Gina and I came to see you,
you said something about

821
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:56,750
how police sometimes use hypnosis.

822
00:53:56,833 --> 00:53:57,916
[Wade] Hm.

823
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,041
What did you mean?

824
00:54:00,708 --> 00:54:03,875
A drive-by shooter
speeds away from the scene.

825
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:08,583
An eyewitness saw the car
but can't remember the license plate.

826
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:11,750
[clears throat]
Well, maybe they do remember it.

827
00:54:12,291 --> 00:54:13,625
Just not consciously.

828
00:54:14,458 --> 00:54:18,791
So, we send them to a hypnotist
who tries to help them recall.

829
00:54:20,333 --> 00:54:22,041
And that will hold up as evidence?

830
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:23,875
-Sometimes.
-What if we did that?

831
00:54:24,791 --> 00:54:28,541
What if you sent me
to whoever you use for that sort of thing?

832
00:54:28,625 --> 00:54:30,125
And they put me under

833
00:54:30,666 --> 00:54:33,333
and try to make me recall
my sessions with Meade.

834
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,458
-It still may not be enough.
-You just said--

835
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:38,000
I said, "Sometimes."

836
00:54:39,375 --> 00:54:41,875
Do you know how hard it is
to charge someone with murder

837
00:54:42,583 --> 00:54:43,708
and get them convicted?

838
00:54:43,791 --> 00:54:47,083
But he all but confessed to me
that he's responsible for Brian and Gina.

839
00:54:47,166 --> 00:54:49,333
-You recorded it?
-He said he was coming after--

840
00:54:49,416 --> 00:54:50,250
Jenn.

841
00:54:51,541 --> 00:54:55,208
With everything else we have,
the other victims, the pattern…

842
00:54:56,875 --> 00:54:59,833
He's planning something. I know he is.

843
00:55:00,375 --> 00:55:03,250
I don't know what,
but the way he was talking last night--

844
00:55:06,291 --> 00:55:07,166
Please.

845
00:55:09,666 --> 00:55:10,916
I just wanna try.

846
00:55:14,958 --> 00:55:16,958
[evocative music]

847
00:55:25,791 --> 00:55:28,791
-[monitor beeping]
-[oxygen hissing]

848
00:55:41,041 --> 00:55:42,333
Please wake up.

849
00:55:53,166 --> 00:55:54,541
[Meade] You were with Gina.

850
00:55:55,958 --> 00:55:57,916
I assume she knows everything you know.

851
00:55:58,416 --> 00:55:59,875
-[Jenn] Yes.
-[Meade] Yes.

852
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,625
Well, thank you for being honest, my love.

853
00:56:04,583 --> 00:56:07,291
I'll take all of your concerns
into consideration.

854
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:10,791
And then he cuts it short.

855
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:14,666
Jenn.

856
00:56:15,916 --> 00:56:19,166
How much do you really know
about hypnotherapy?

857
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,875
[sniffles] Not much.

858
00:56:20,958 --> 00:56:23,333
Well, it's an incredibly powerful tool.

859
00:56:24,708 --> 00:56:27,500
When handled with care and integrity,

860
00:56:27,583 --> 00:56:29,500
it can be a force for good.

861
00:56:30,666 --> 00:56:33,583
But in the wrong hands,
hypnosis can be dangerous.

862
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,416
What are you feeling?

863
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:47,375
[exhales deeply] I am having, um,

864
00:56:47,458 --> 00:56:51,166
some trust issues
with your profession right now.

865
00:56:53,625 --> 00:56:56,791
Jenn, I understand
that this may not be worth much,

866
00:56:57,791 --> 00:56:59,416
but you can trust me.

867
00:57:00,833 --> 00:57:02,375
I'm one of the good ones.

868
00:57:03,416 --> 00:57:05,333
And I'm only gonna have a look around.

869
00:57:06,666 --> 00:57:11,208
Just see what the subconscious retained
from those sessions with Dr. Meade.

870
00:57:11,875 --> 00:57:12,708
Hmm?

871
00:57:14,333 --> 00:57:16,791
[deep sigh]

872
00:57:21,416 --> 00:57:23,708
[doctor] Focus on the sound
of the metronome,

873
00:57:24,583 --> 00:57:25,833
keeping time.

874
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,375
And as you feel the weight of your body

875
00:57:30,958 --> 00:57:33,333
sinking into the couch,

876
00:57:33,416 --> 00:57:36,083
I want you to let everything go.

877
00:57:37,666 --> 00:57:41,875
Let the world around you slow down.

878
00:57:43,125 --> 00:57:45,541
[ticks faintly]

879
00:57:49,583 --> 00:57:50,916
[metronome stops suddenly]

880
00:57:51,666 --> 00:57:54,166
[doctor] Jenn, can you hear me?

881
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:55,166
[Jenn] Yes.

882
00:57:55,791 --> 00:57:59,041
[doctor] Now, I want you to tell me
everything you remember

883
00:57:59,125 --> 00:58:02,500
from your sessions with Dr. Collin Meade.

884
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,375

886
00:58:08,375 --> 00:58:09,250
Jenn?

887

[choking]

888
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:15,625
Wake up, Jenn.

889
00:58:15,708 --> 00:58:16,750
Jennifer!

890
00:58:18,708 --> 00:58:21,333
I need you to listen
to the sound of my voice

891
00:58:21,416 --> 00:58:23,750
and come back to this room right now!

892

893
00:58:28,833 --> 00:58:31,750
[Meade] My mentor was a psychiatrist.

894
00:58:31,833 --> 00:58:33,166
Dr. Xavier Sullivan.

895
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:34,916

903

What happened?

904
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,416
Dr. Graham, what happened?

905
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:33,958
[Dr. Graham panting]

906

[sighs]

907
00:59:40,041 --> 00:59:42,083
I've never seen anything like that.

908
00:59:44,208 --> 00:59:46,375
He must have planted some sort of

909
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,583
fail-safe or--

910
00:59:48,666 --> 00:59:49,750
What's a fail-safe?

911
00:59:49,833 --> 00:59:52,333
In case anybody
ever tried to do what we're doing.

912
00:59:53,541 --> 00:59:55,208
And I have no way of knowing

913
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:58,833
how many sustained
post-hypnotic suggestions he placed.

914
01:00:01,208 --> 01:00:03,541
And these can be triggered
at any given moment.

915
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,916
[soft brooding music]

916
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:15,791
I remember something.

917
01:00:19,541 --> 01:00:20,708
There was a house.

918
01:00:33,041 --> 01:00:34,250
What's today's date?

919
01:00:35,083 --> 01:00:36,208
It's the sixth.

920
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,125
-I have to go.
-No, wait.

921
01:00:47,916 --> 01:00:50,208
There's one more thing I could try.

922
01:00:50,291 --> 01:00:52,416
Look, I can't remove
all of his suggestions,

923
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:56,416
but maybe I could plant
something of my own.

924
01:00:57,958 --> 01:00:59,458
Like a counter trigger?

925
01:01:02,083 --> 01:01:03,000
Exactly.

926
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:08,416
I swear to God,
this is the last time I'm doing this.

927
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,500
[fast-paced, thrilling music]

928
01:01:47,875 --> 01:01:49,541
[Jenn] Rollins, it didn't work.

929
01:01:49,625 --> 01:01:53,000
But I found out that Meade
has a mentor named Xavier Sullivan.

930
01:01:53,083 --> 01:01:53,916
[Wade] Okay.

931
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,708
[Jenn] Have you heard
of "Project MKUltra"?

932
01:01:56,791 --> 01:01:59,375
[Wade] Yeah, it was a CIA project
in the '60s.

933
01:01:59,458 --> 01:02:02,958
[Jenn] Well, Sullivan is a hypnotist.
And the CIA had recruited him

934
01:02:03,041 --> 01:02:05,958
to use hypnosis
to plant false memories in people.

935
01:02:06,041 --> 01:02:07,708
I'm on my way to see him.

936
01:02:07,791 --> 01:02:09,583
[Wade] No, Jenn, that's not a good idea.

937
01:02:09,666 --> 01:02:12,583
[Jenn] He might know something
about Meade that can help us.

938
01:02:12,666 --> 01:02:14,666
-[Wade] Just wait for me.
-[Jenn] We don't have time.

939
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:16,708
[Wade] Jenn. Jenn!

[Jenn] Mr. Sullivan?

946
01:03:13,666 --> 01:03:14,500
Hello?

947
01:03:19,916 --> 01:03:20,916

948
01:03:23,416 --> 01:03:24,750

949
01:03:37,791 --> 01:03:39,250

[menacing music]

951
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:58,541
[Jenn] Oh my God.

952
01:03:59,208 --> 01:04:00,833
[Meade] It's uncanny, isn't it?

953
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:05,583
My wife was such a beautiful woman,

954
01:04:06,625 --> 01:04:08,458
but then so are you, Jennifer.

955
01:04:09,833 --> 01:04:12,250
-I don't understand.
-Xavier was my father.

956
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,583
He left me this place when he died.

957

958
01:04:19,666 --> 01:04:21,125

-Sleep.

It's Rollins.

[man] Hey, Rollins.
I ran the prints from that spoon.

965
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:35,708
They belonged to a man
named Julian Sullivan.

-His real name is Sullivan.
-Jenn, tell me where you are.

977

There's nothing
quite like a woman's scent.

and they seemed right at first,

1006

but ultimately,

1007
01:06:59,041 --> 01:07:00,583
they just weren't meant to be.

1064
01:10:18,958 --> 01:10:20,833
[quietly] We want the same thing.

1065
01:10:27,125 --> 01:10:28,791
We share wounds.

1066
01:10:33,458 --> 01:10:37,333
Your loss of Brian and your son Daniel.

1067
01:10:38,375 --> 01:10:39,750
My loss of Amy

1068
01:10:40,708 --> 01:10:43,041
and the life I thought we'd have together.

1069
01:10:46,625 --> 01:10:48,458
We will be that for each other.

1070
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,083
Go like this.

1071
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:58,041

[Meade] You don't happen
to know today's date, do you?

1077
01:11:29,875 --> 01:11:31,375
Now you know why I waited.

1078
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:35,833
Our anniversary.

1079
01:11:37,166 --> 01:11:38,375
I told you,

1080
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:42,666

Jenn, listen to me.

1096
01:12:51,083 --> 01:12:53,333
I have to go find him.
You're gonna be okay.

1097
01:12:53,416 --> 01:12:55,500
What? No, no, no! Rollins, no!

1098
01:12:55,583 --> 01:12:58,708
Please don't go!
You can't go! Please don't go!

You're okay.

1132

You're…

1133
01:16:34,541 --> 01:16:36,000
You're a good shot.

1134

[doctor] Jenn.

1141
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:14,583
In the recording you played me,

1142
01:17:15,291 --> 01:17:18,208
Dr. Meade called you "my love."

1143
01:17:18,291 --> 01:17:20,291
[Meade]
Thank you for being honest, my love.

1144
01:17:20,916 --> 01:17:24,875
If you are ever
under a post-hypnotic suggestion

1145
01:17:24,958 --> 01:17:30,583
by Dr. Collin Meade,
and he refers to you as "my love,"

1146
01:17:32,125 --> 01:17:33,708
you will ignore

1147
01:17:33,791 --> 01:17:37,416
every single trigger
he put into your head.

1148
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,791
And you will see the world around you

1149
01:17:40,875 --> 01:17:42,791
for what it truly is.

[Meade groans]

1155
01:18:12,041 --> 01:18:13,500

Oh my God! Oh God.

1157
01:18:15,708 --> 01:18:18,333

No, no, no! Hey, hey, hey! Hi.

01:18:57,375 --> 01:18:59,208
Right here. Look at me, look at me.

1171
01:18:59,291 --> 01:19:01,166
Look at me, look at me. Yes.

1172
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:03,541
Hi, hi! You're okay, you're okay.

1173
01:19:04,125 --> 01:19:06,458
-[weakly] You shot me.
-[Jenn] I'm sorry.

1174

Stay-- Yeah. Stay with me. Hi.
You're okay. You're gonna be okay.

-[whispering] Stay with me, okay?
-[sirens wailing]

1176
01:19:14,208 --> 01:19:18,708
[Jenn] I can hear them. I hear sirens.
They are coming. It's okay.

1177
01:19:18,791 --> 01:19:21,208
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

[dramatic music]

1179
01:19:46,541 --> 01:19:49,500
I think it's great. We present it
to the team at Monday's meeting.

1180
01:19:49,583 --> 01:19:51,000
But I'm a huge fan.

1181
01:19:51,958 --> 01:19:53,708
Uh-huh. Great work, Tiff.

1182
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:55,916
Yeah, I'll see you then.

1183
01:20:02,083 --> 01:20:04,041
I'm definitely moving. [chuckles]

1184
01:20:04,875 --> 01:20:07,625
You'll like the new place.
You don't have to. I understand.

1185
01:20:07,708 --> 01:20:09,875
I know you're very particular
about your things.

1186

1188
01:20:16,041 --> 01:20:17,208
I'm sorry.

1189
01:20:19,458 --> 01:20:20,958
I'm sorry I left.

1190
01:20:23,333 --> 01:20:25,708
I'm sorry
I didn't share my grief with you.

1191
01:20:27,708 --> 01:20:31,000
I'm sorry that I thought losing Daniel

1192
01:20:31,625 --> 01:20:33,583
was harder for me than it was for you.

1193
01:20:34,166 --> 01:20:36,500
And I know it's not my fault
what happened to him.

1194
01:20:36,583 --> 01:20:38,916
No matter how much I wanna blame myself.

1195
01:20:43,333 --> 01:20:47,375
But it is my fault what happened to us.

1196
01:20:51,708 --> 01:20:54,125
And for that, I'm really, truly sorry.

1197
01:21:03,708 --> 01:21:05,791
The doctors say your tests are promising.

1198
01:21:06,375 --> 01:21:07,833
That's really good news.

1199
01:21:09,708 --> 01:21:12,250
And when you wake up,
I'll be sitting right here.

-My condolences on your promotion.
-[chuckles]

1203
01:21:30,708 --> 01:21:32,166
I'm regretting it already.

1204
01:21:32,708 --> 01:21:36,750
I left you alone,
but I did wanna say thank you

1205
01:21:37,250 --> 01:21:38,291
for everything.

1206
01:21:39,583 --> 01:21:41,875
I wasn't sure when I'd see you again, but…

1207
01:21:43,416 --> 01:21:45,375
I figured you'd come around eventually.

1208
01:21:47,375 --> 01:21:49,041
A token of my appreciation.

1209
01:21:50,875 --> 01:21:52,291
Take care of yourself, yeah?
