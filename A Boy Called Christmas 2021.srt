<i>I still don't get why</i>
<i>we all have to listen.</i>

47
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:42,041
<i>Because the universe</i>

00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,291
<i>After it, you sleep,</i>

51

<i>-[Papa sighs] Not again.</i>

<i>Why not?</i>

99
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,541
<i>It isn't my story to tell.</i>

100
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,541
<i>But Mama's not here anymore.</i>

101
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,583
<i>Okay then, I'll tell you about Elfhelm.</i>

102
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:47,125
<i>A long time ago,</i>
<i>in a place not unlike this one,</i>

103
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:51,083
<i>lived a young girl named Lumi.</i>

104
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,083
<i>[inhales deeply]</i>

105
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:57,375
<i>One day while gathering acorns</i>
<i>in the woods,</i>

106
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,166
<i>Lumi became hopelessly lost.</i>

107
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:02,291
<i>She tried to find her home,</i>

108
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,833
<i>but the more she searched,</i>
<i>the farther from home she went.</i>

109
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,916
<i>Over the river and under the moon,</i>

110
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,833
<i>over the pointy mountain,</i>

111
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:15,041
<i>all the way down past the, uh…</i>

112
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,125
<i>[Nikolas] Past the sleeping giants.</i>

113
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:20,916
<i>[Papa] Past the sleeping giants</i>
<i>and through the sky she walked.</i>

114
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,375
<i>[inhales deeply] To a place</i>
<i>where snow was soft as clouds.</i>

115
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,041
<i>[Nikolas] Then what happened?</i>

116
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,416
<i>[Papa] Our Lumi was near collapse,</i>

117
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,833
<i>and at last, she stumbled upon</i>
<i>a secret village called Elfhelm</i>

118
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:38,250
<i>where lived the elves,</i>
<i>the happiest people in the world</i>

119
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,708
<i>and the most magical place in the world.</i>

120
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:45,333
<i>There Lumi stayed until the snow cleared,</i>

121
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,958
<i>and she was finally able to return</i>
<i>to her home in the south,</i>

122
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,041
<i>her pockets full of chocolates.</i>

123
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,166
<i>You believe this story, don't you?</i>

124
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,625
<i>The ending is a stretch.</i>
<i>The chocolate would have melted.</i>

125
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,458
<i>But the rest?</i>

126
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:05,291
<i>The magic and the elves?</i>

127
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,208
<i>[Papa] I've never seen them.</i>

128
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,333
<i>But you believe in them.</i>

129
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:14,625
<i>Your mother did. And to her,</i>
<i>believing was as good as knowing.</i>

<i>[mouse squeaking]</i>

131
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:19,208
<i>What was that?</i>

132
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:22,291
<i>-[Papa] It sounded like a squeak.</i>
<i>-[Nikolas] I think it was more of a creak.</i>

133
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,291
<i>Definitely a squeak.</i>

134
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,875
<i>-By the way, that's an overreaction.</i>
<i>-Out of the way, Nikolas.</i>

00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,000
<i>We're going to see the King, Miika.</i>

168
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:17,666
<i>King.</i>

169
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,750
<i>-He's too excited to talk.</i>
<i>-He shouldn't be.</i>

170
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:25,500
<i>-[bell tolling]</i>
<i>-[Nikolas] Why? You love the King.</i>

171
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,250
<i>[Papa] Of course I love the King.</i>

172
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,958
<i>He's a great man,</i>
<i>deserves all that he has.</i>

173
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:33,166
<i>The thing is, we deserve it too.</i>
<i>Everybody does.</i>

174
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,083
<i>-[Nikolas] We manage with what we have.</i>
<i>-[sighs] We have very little.</i>

175
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,291
<i>We have each other.</i>

176
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,833
<i>[Papa] And that's wonderful.</i>

177
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,541
<i>[indistinct chatter]</i>

178
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:41,666

<i>-[coughing continues]</i>

184

<i>You okay? Would you like a glass of water?</i>

185
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,500
<i>I can ring a little bell</i>
<i>and someone will bring it.</i>

186
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:15,458
<i>No? Sure? All right.</i>

187
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:16,708
<i>[inhales deeply]</i>

<i>We all know times are hard.</i>

189

<i>I mean really, really, really hard.</i>

190
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,583
<i>I can't remember the last time I smiled.</i>
<i>Can you?</i>

191
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,833
<i>What is there to smile about?</i>

192
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,041
<i>We're all miserable.</i>

193
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:36,333
<i>We're all missing something,</i>
<i>and I think we know what that is.</i>

194
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:40,000
<i>-A health care system.</i>
<i>-[man 2] That would be a very good thing.</i>

195
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,250
<i>It's an idea, but not quite--</i>

196
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,375
<i>-A living wage!</i>
<i>-[people agreeing]</i>

197
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:45,708
<i>Again, worth discussing.</i>

198
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:49,000
<i>A fair system of governance?</i>
<i>Enough food to feed people?</i>

199
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,791
<i>Okay, maybe I should just tell you</i>
<i>what I think it is that we're missing.</i>

<i>A spark of magic to keep us all going.</i>

203
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:09,500
<i>I've gathered you here because you are</i>
<i>the hardiest men and women in the land.</i>

<i>-[man 1 coughs]</i>
<i>-Not you.</i>

205

<i>And I'm asking you</i>
<i>to go to the very edges of our kingdom.</i>

206
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:18,333
<i>Go beyond</i>

207
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:24,625

<i>-[man 3] A visionist.</i>
<i>-[gasps]</i>

209

<i>[Nikolas whispering] Oh no.</i>

211
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,416
<i>Any who set out</i>
<i>will be well paid for their efforts.</i>

212
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,416
<i>-[squeaking]</i>
<i>-The path may be dangerous.</i>

213
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,583
<i>Some of you will die,</i>
<i>probably most of you.</i>

214
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:45,625
<i>But if you succeed,</i>
<i>your award will be far greater.</i>

215

<i>-Got you, Miika!</i>
<i>-[man 4] Say what?</i>

216

<i>What'd he give you?</i>

223

<i>Two kind words, Papa,</i>
<i>that'll warm me through the long month.</i>

224

<i>[Papa] No, how much money?</i>

225
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:14,875
<i>I don't know.</i>

226
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:18,416
<i>This is half a crown.</i>
<i>Can feed a mouse for a week with this.</i>

<i>Spoon.</i>

231
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,750

<i>Yes, it is me.</i>

236
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:54,041
<i>Pretty close thing with the bear</i>
<i>the other day. Thank you for that.</i>

237
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,750
<i>We need to talk.</i>
<i>Can the boy go to another room?</i>

238
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,916
<i>-We don't have another room.</i>
<i>-And I want to hear.</i>

239
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,083
<i>We can talk outside.</i>
<i>You're welcome to borrow my hat.</i>

240
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:07,583
<i>I'll survive.</i>

241
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,541

<i>-[sniffing]</i>
<i>-[door closes]</i>

<i>[Nikolas grunting]</i>

245
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,125
<i>Nikolas, the King's quest,</i>
<i>I'm going to do it.</i>

246
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,416
<i>You're going away?</i>

247
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,250
<i>Not for long. Two months.</i>

248
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,625
<i>Two months?</i>

249
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:44,875
<i>Maybe three.</i>
<i>But I'll be back before you know it.</i>

250
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:48,541
<i>-It'll be worth it.</i>
<i>-To bring some new hope to the world?</i>

251
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,750
<i>To claim the reward.</i>

252
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,416
<i>But isn't the reward</i>
<i>bringing us new hope and wonder?</i>

253
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,750
<i>The reward is the money,</i>

254
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:01,583
<i>and the money means food and warm clothes</i>
<i>so you can have a life.</i>

255
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,541
<i>The life</i>
<i>I stood at your mother's grave site</i>

256
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,000
<i>and promised you'd have.</i>

257

<i>[Nikolas] Where will you go?</i>

263
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,375
<i>Anders is assembling a group.</i>

264
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:38,541
<i>We'll be heading north,</i>
<i>far north, to find Elfhelm.</i>

265
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,125
<i>-Elfhelm!</i>
<i>-[Papa] If it exists.</i>

266
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,958
<i>-I know it does. You have to take me.</i>
<i>-[Papa] No, it's too dangerous.</i>

267
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,625
<i>There'll be many nights sleeping out</i>
<i>in the cold.</i>

268
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,041
<i>That's fine. I love the cold.</i>

269
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,500
<i>Once you get north of Seipajarvi,</i>

270
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:50,333
<i>there's nothing but ice planes and lakes</i>
<i>and snow-covered fields.</i>

271
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,833
<i>Snow-covered fields are my favorite.</i>

272
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,500
<i>After that, the journey only gets harder,</i>

273
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,375
<i>which is why no one's made it</i>
<i>to the far north.</i>

274
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,833
<i>That's not why.</i>
<i>It's because no one knows the way.</i>

275
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:01,291
<i>The words in the story are totally vague,</i>
<i>and you can barely remember them anyway.</i>

276
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:04,208
<i>Please, Papa. I can help. I know I can.</i>

277
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,375
<i>Please.</i>

278
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,583
<i>I set off at first light.</i>

<i>I'll miss you, Christmas.</i>

281

<i>You never told me why Mama called me that.</i>

282
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,166
<i>She never told me either.</i>

283
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:40,625
<i>It's just a word.</i>
<i>It doesn't have to mean anything.</i>

284

<i>[woman]</i> Dearest brother,

350
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,250

1464

<i>a human girl wandered into our village…</i>

1465

<i>tired and lost.</i>

1466
01:24:35,625 --> 01:24:37,291
<i>We took her in.</i>

1467
01:24:38,250 --> 01:24:43,916
<i>She was loving and kind and full of hope.</i>

1468
01:24:46,916 --> 01:24:48,416
<i>She became our friend…</i>

<i>my friend…</i>

1470

<i>and she returned to her home in the South.</i>

<i>Hmm.</i>

1473
01:25:10,375 --> 01:25:13,375

<i>As I recall, Dimelza,</i>

01:25:20,166 --> 01:25:24,416
<i>there was a time</i>
<i>you loved humans more than most.</i>

1476

<i>-[Nikolas] She never did forget.</i>
