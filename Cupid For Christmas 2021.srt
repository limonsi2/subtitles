you fell in love,

177
00:08:24,174 --> 00:08:26,145
it was forever.

178
00:08:26,212 --> 00:08:29,051
Of course, you only lived
'til 35, so it was tolerable.

179
00:08:29,118 --> 00:08:30,420
Things are different now.

180
00:08:30,487 --> 00:08:32,692
I think you're too sensitive
for this kind of work.

181
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:35,196
‐Too sensitive for love?
Come on!

182
00:08:38,036 --> 00:08:39,973
‐All right.

183
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,777
All right, I'll give you
one more chance.

184
00:08:41,843 --> 00:08:43,479
‐What?
‐What?

185
00:08:43,547 --> 00:08:46,920
‐No‐‐ no. What a‐‐
what a great idea.

186

[inhales] Merciful
is what you are.

187
00:08:50,594 --> 00:08:53,132
‐Yes, I am.
‐Thank you, Cupid.

188
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,636
Just you wait, all right.

189
00:08:54,703 --> 00:08:56,138
I'm gonna be turning
those numbers upside down.

190
00:08:56,205 --> 00:08:58,877
The world is gonna
be romantic again.

191
00:08:58,944 --> 00:09:01,817
‐I'm not asking you to
set the world on fire.

192
00:09:01,883 --> 00:09:04,154
Just make one person
fall in love.

193
00:09:04,221 --> 00:09:06,893
And I've got
the perfect case for ya.

194
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,999
‐Oh.
A case from the X‐Files .

195
00:09:13,206 --> 00:09:16,078
‐If you can find romance
for this guy,

196
00:09:16,145 --> 00:09:19,084
then you are worthy
of being the god of love.

197
00:09:20,955 --> 00:09:23,560
Charlie Conrad.
College professor.

198
00:09:23,627 --> 00:09:26,031
We call him "the anomaly".

199
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,568
He's unmatchable.

200
00:09:27,635 --> 00:09:29,572
‐But there's someone
for everyone.

201
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:31,075
‐Not this guy.

202
00:09:31,142 --> 00:09:34,281
‐[Ruby] But he seems nice.
‐[glass clattering]

[Philomena chuckling]

204
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:43,366
[Cupid] I could show you
50 more clips just like that.

205
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:47,775
Every opportunity for romance
seems to go wrong.

206
00:09:47,842 --> 00:09:51,015
Either his timing is off.
or he's trying too hard.

207
00:09:51,081 --> 00:09:53,687
Right now, I think he's
given up trying altogether.

208
00:09:53,754 --> 00:09:55,290
‐Poor guy.

209
00:09:55,356 --> 00:09:56,560
‐Poor you.

210
00:09:56,626 --> 00:09:58,362
This is your last chance.

211
00:09:58,429 --> 00:10:00,901
You've got until Christmas Eve.

212
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:02,972
‐Got your holidays
mixed up, don't you?

213
00:10:04,374 --> 00:10:05,310
‐You think that's funny, huh?

214
00:10:07,114 --> 00:10:08,449
‐No.

215
00:10:08,517 --> 00:10:10,420
‐You know the last time
I had a Christmas vacation?

216
00:10:10,487 --> 00:10:12,190
1472.

217
00:10:12,257 --> 00:10:15,096
1472, the last Christmas
I saw my family,

Christmas tree,
presents, eggnog.

219
00:10:18,336 --> 00:10:19,639
I want a Christmas vacation.

220
00:10:19,706 --> 00:10:21,275
‐You deserve
a Christmas vacation, sir.

221
00:10:21,342 --> 00:10:23,514
‐I do! Philomena, go along

222
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,083
and assist her.
‐Sir!

223
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,955
‐When the clock strikes
midnight on Christmas Eve,

224
00:10:28,022 --> 00:10:31,228
you will either take my place
as the god of love.

225
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,734
or you won't.
Now get out of here.

226
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,571
‐Thank you.

‐Really professional.

232
00:10:56,412 --> 00:10:58,382
If you could just try not
to traumatize the mortals.

233
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,788
[Philomena] Mm. You teaching me
about professionalism?

234
00:11:00,855 --> 00:11:02,123
That is hilarious.

235
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,894
‐I know you're here
to assist me,

236
00:11:03,961 --> 00:11:05,296
but I'd rather work alone.

237
00:11:05,363 --> 00:11:06,933
Okay, this job's going to be
a piece of cake.

238
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,839
I just‐‐ I just
need to find the target.

239
00:11:11,308 --> 00:11:12,545
‐Target acquired.

[clicks tongue]

241
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,682
[Ruby] Huh.

242
00:11:15,885 --> 00:11:17,287
[Philomena]
So, what's the plan?

243
00:11:17,354 --> 00:11:19,124
You gonna chat him up?

244
00:11:19,191 --> 00:11:20,794
Ask him what he's looking for
in a soul mate?

245
00:11:20,861 --> 00:11:23,432
Give him a
"What's your type?" survey?

246
00:11:23,499 --> 00:11:25,036
‐Nope.
That's the old me, okay?

247
00:11:25,103 --> 00:11:26,940
No more hopeless romantic Ruby.

Maybe you have changed.

[Charlie] Oh, man.
I'm so sorry.

264
00:12:16,907 --> 00:12:18,944

to make it through a semester

‐It's a sore subject.

Rather not talk about it,
really.

That is my motto.

Well, I gotta go.

And, well, I think I might be
freezing to death, so.

‐Okay. Keep it.
Early Christmas present.

‐So without a solid working
knowledge of history,

history is doomed
to repeat itself.

322
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:44,234
And if we realize that
we didn't treat people well,

323
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,004
or if we realized that,
you know,

324
00:14:46,071 --> 00:14:48,342
maybe there's a better way
to do these things,

325
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:51,014
we can do it better
the next time.

326

I'm kind of confused‐‐

So I was‐‐
‐[Ruby] Hi, excuse me.

00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,166
Can I talk to you guys?

331
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,638
I have a few questions
about Charlie.

332
00:15:02,705 --> 00:15:05,176
‐Who's Charlie?
‐She means Professor Conrad.

333
00:15:05,243 --> 00:15:06,913
‐Are you a cop?
‐She looks like a cop.

334
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,052
‐Um. I'm wearing pink.

335
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:14,027
I'm, uh. I'm a reporter.
And I'm‐‐ I'm writing a story

336
00:15:14,094 --> 00:15:15,798
and I'm looking
for some background.

337
00:15:15,864 --> 00:15:18,202
‐On Professor Conrad?

338
00:15:18,269 --> 00:15:21,776
Not to be mean, but he isn't
exactly the kind of person

339
00:15:21,843 --> 00:15:24,114
you would write
an article about.

340
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:27,387
‐Oh, sorry. Excuse me.

341
00:15:27,454 --> 00:15:31,428
‐Whatever background he has,
I promise you it is boring.

342
00:15:31,495 --> 00:15:34,602
‐Well, maybe not looking
like a cop is your whole thing.

343
00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:36,639
I'm onto you. cop.

344
00:15:41,415 --> 00:15:44,020
‐Hi. You look like
a bright young man.

345
00:15:44,087 --> 00:15:45,624
What can you tell me
about Charlie?

346
00:15:45,691 --> 00:15:47,595
‐I mean, he's‐‐
he's like a teacher.

347
00:15:47,661 --> 00:15:49,431
It's not like we hang out.

348
00:15:49,498 --> 00:15:50,701
‐Yeah.

349
00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:53,673
‐He's nice, I guess, but
kind of unreasonable?

350
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,711
Like when I tell him
I don't have my project

351
00:15:55,777 --> 00:15:57,982
because my life has been
so extra right now?

352
00:15:58,048 --> 00:15:59,451
And he gives me an extension,

353
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,523
but it's not really
enough of an extension.

354
00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:03,560
And then he doesn't even like,
try to understand

355
00:16:03,627 --> 00:16:06,098
that I have a lot
going on right now.

356
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:09,739
But, you know, nice.

357
00:16:09,806 --> 00:16:11,208
‐Nice.

358
00:16:11,275 --> 00:16:13,179
‐I like that he doesn't
pretend to know my name.

359
00:16:13,245 --> 00:16:14,749
None of the teachers
know my name.

360
00:16:14,816 --> 00:16:17,120
But Professor Conrad
doesn't pretend like he does.

361
00:16:17,187 --> 00:16:18,857
‐I'll remember your name.

362
00:16:18,924 --> 00:16:19,992
What's your name?

363
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:21,596
‐Well, as far as
teachers go,

364
00:16:21,663 --> 00:16:23,767
he's probably like,
my second favorite,

365
00:16:23,834 --> 00:16:25,771
but that's really just because
I hate history.

366
00:16:25,838 --> 00:16:26,906
Like, I hate it.

367
00:16:26,973 --> 00:16:27,908
[Samantha] Why are you yelling?

368
00:16:27,975 --> 00:16:29,879
‐I'm expressing myself.

369
00:16:29,946 --> 00:16:31,048
‐Do you need a hug?

370
00:16:34,487 --> 00:16:35,557
‐[magical chimes]
‐Hi, Charlie!

371
00:16:35,624 --> 00:16:38,830
‐Oh! Whoa, hey.

372
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:40,233
You're, uh. you gave me

373
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:41,536
[over computer]
the pink towel.

374
00:16:41,603 --> 00:16:43,038
‐Yeah. Mm‐hm,
that's me, Ruby.

375
00:16:43,105 --> 00:16:44,742
‐Right. Well, hi again.
‐[Ruby] Hi.

376
00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:46,546
Charlie, I have the offer
of a lifetime for you.

377
00:16:46,613 --> 00:16:50,219
‐Oh? What do you mean?
Selling essential oils?

378
00:16:50,286 --> 00:16:52,156
‐I hear they're really great,
but no, no.

379
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,461
I'm here to help you.

380
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:56,431
‐Help me what?

381
00:16:56,498 --> 00:16:57,835
‐Fall in love.

382
00:16:57,902 --> 00:17:00,139
‐Hmm, wow, that sounds fun, but.
not really in the market.

383
00:17:00,206 --> 00:17:01,509
So nice seeing you again.

384
00:17:01,576 --> 00:17:03,279
‐You know, it's nice
to see you too!

385
00:17:03,345 --> 00:17:04,682
See, Charlie, I'm what
you could call a matchmaker.

386
00:17:04,749 --> 00:17:06,553
‐Ah, so you want me
to pay you to fix me up?

387
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:09,357
‐For you, totally free.
‐Mm.

388
00:17:09,424 --> 00:17:11,461
So you're a matchmaker
for charity cases?

389
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:14,467
‐Yes! But I can see by your face
that's a bad thing.

390
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:15,637
So, no.

391
00:17:15,704 --> 00:17:17,307
[over computer] No, I‐I.

392
00:17:17,373 --> 00:17:19,244
I‐I can just help you be happy.

393
00:17:19,311 --> 00:17:22,150
‐Yeah, thanks but no thanks.

394
00:17:22,217 --> 00:17:25,323
‐But. but you're lonely.

395
00:17:25,389 --> 00:17:27,861
D‐don't you want love?
Everybody wants love.

396
00:17:27,928 --> 00:17:29,865
‐No, not me.
I've retired.

397
00:17:29,932 --> 00:17:31,703
‐But don't you want a sweetheart
to spend Christmas with?

398
00:17:31,769 --> 00:17:33,573
‐No, I do not want that.

399
00:17:35,276 --> 00:17:36,512
You seem nice.

400
00:17:36,579 --> 00:17:38,148
‐Oh.

401
00:17:38,215 --> 00:17:39,785
‐You helped me
out of the fountain.

402
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:40,787
‐Gave you a towel.

403
00:17:40,854 --> 00:17:42,625
‐Gave me a towel. But.

404
00:17:42,691 --> 00:17:47,400
not to be rude, but.
you're kind of freaking me out.

405
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:49,471
‐Oh.
‐Yeah. Yeah.

406
00:17:49,538 --> 00:17:52,343
So, if you stop walking,
I'll keep walking and‐‐

407
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,515
and‐‐ and we can just.

408
00:17:54,582 --> 00:17:55,918
‐I don't want to freak you out.

409
00:17:55,984 --> 00:17:57,320
‐Yeah, thanks.
‐Yeah, yeah.

410
00:17:57,387 --> 00:17:58,523
Okay.
‐[Charlie] Bye.

411
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,725
‐Oh, see you around, Charlie.

412
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:00,994
[Charlie] Yup, okay.

413
00:18:01,061 --> 00:18:03,065
‐Man!

414
00:18:03,132 --> 00:18:04,467
[exhales]

415
00:18:07,942 --> 00:18:10,681
[dog barking in distance]

416
00:18:18,262 --> 00:18:19,431
[magical chimes]

417
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:22,538
‐Okay, Charlie.
We need to talk.

418
00:18:22,605 --> 00:18:24,809
[screams]

419
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,111
‐Why are you in my house?

420
00:18:26,178 --> 00:18:27,480
‐Because I mean business.

421
00:18:27,548 --> 00:18:29,719
‐Well, that is terrifying.

422
00:18:29,785 --> 00:18:33,192
Look, I don't have any money.
I'm a teacher.

423
00:18:33,258 --> 00:18:35,096
‐What? No, I'm‐‐
I'm freaking you out again.

424
00:18:35,162 --> 00:18:36,231
I'm Ruby. Remember?

425
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:37,400
With the‐‐
‐Ah. oh, yes!

426
00:18:37,467 --> 00:18:39,939
Wait! The towel.
Hold on. Hold on.

427
00:18:40,006 --> 00:18:41,776
Aaaah.

428
00:18:41,843 --> 00:18:44,849
Ah! Here. Here, take‐‐

429
00:18:48,322 --> 00:18:49,825
[magical chimes]

430
00:18:49,892 --> 00:18:50,894
‐I don't want the towel.

431
00:18:50,961 --> 00:18:51,896
[Charlie gasps]

432
00:18:51,963 --> 00:18:52,865
[Charlie yells in fear]

433
00:18:56,773 --> 00:18:57,675
[Ruby sighs]

434
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:04,655
[lamp smashes]

435
00:19:06,124 --> 00:19:07,493
‐Charlie!

436
00:19:07,561 --> 00:19:09,832
That lamp was like
the nicest thing in here.

437
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:11,301
[sighs]

438
00:19:11,368 --> 00:19:12,871
Can we dial this down a notch?

439
00:19:12,938 --> 00:19:14,007
‐No!

440
00:19:14,074 --> 00:19:15,677
Help!

441
00:19:15,744 --> 00:19:16,779
[Charlie groans and thuds to
floor]

442
00:19:16,846 --> 00:19:17,881
‐Oh.

443
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,852
[grunting]

444
00:19:21,723 --> 00:19:23,760
[screaming]

445
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,805
‐I think I might have used
the wrong tactic here.

446
00:19:29,872 --> 00:19:31,341
Can we start over?

447
00:19:33,078 --> 00:19:35,082
[chuckles] Okay, good.

448
00:19:35,149 --> 00:19:36,351
Ahh.

449
00:19:36,418 --> 00:19:39,057
‐What is going on?

450
00:19:39,124 --> 00:19:41,796
‐So this is gonna
sound weird, but.

451
00:19:41,863 --> 00:19:42,965
have you heard of Cupid?

452
00:19:43,032 --> 00:19:44,300
‐Cupid?

453
00:19:44,367 --> 00:19:47,106
Like, as in.
Valentine's Day Cupid?

454
00:19:47,173 --> 00:19:50,614
‐Yes! But he's Cupid every day.

455
00:19:53,018 --> 00:19:54,320
‐Oh, okay.
‐[Ruby] Yeah.

456
00:19:54,387 --> 00:19:56,458
I've never told a mortal before,

457
00:19:56,526 --> 00:19:58,429
but I only have 11 days.

458
00:19:58,495 --> 00:20:00,199
So gloves are coming off,
Charlie.

459
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:01,803
‐But you‐you're
not gonna hit me, right?

460
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:04,140
‐Oh, no, no, no. I'm‐‐
I'm not gonna hit you.

461
00:20:04,207 --> 00:20:06,411
I'm not gonna hit you. Okay?

462
00:20:06,478 --> 00:20:10,386
I‐I'm about to tell you
a really big secret.

463
00:20:10,453 --> 00:20:12,725
And I need you
to prepare yourself.

464
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:13,727
‐Okay.

465
00:20:15,731 --> 00:20:18,302
‐I work for Cupid.
And if things go well,

466
00:20:18,368 --> 00:20:19,905
I'm going to
move into his position

467
00:20:19,972 --> 00:20:23,112
and become the god of love,
if you can believe it.

468
00:20:23,178 --> 00:20:25,349
Or I guess, the goddess of love.

469
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:28,288
I guess you could say
I'm a Cupid in training.

470
00:20:28,355 --> 00:20:29,424
‐That is fascinating.

471
00:20:29,491 --> 00:20:31,027
‐[giggles] Yes.

472
00:20:31,094 --> 00:20:34,902
‐What are the job requirements
for something like that?

473
00:20:34,969 --> 00:20:36,539
‐Well.

474
00:20:36,606 --> 00:20:37,473
hey!

475
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:40,346
[running footsteps]

476
00:20:40,413 --> 00:20:41,749
[magical chimes]

477
00:20:41,816 --> 00:20:42,885
‐[door slams]
‐[Charlie] Ooh!

478
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:45,690
[door hinges creak]

479
00:20:45,757 --> 00:20:47,895
[loud thud]

480
00:20:47,961 --> 00:20:48,930
‐Oops.

481
00:20:56,077 --> 00:20:57,681
Feeling better?

482
00:20:57,748 --> 00:21:00,921
‐Before you broke into my house
and beat me up? No.

483
00:21:00,987 --> 00:21:03,091
‐Beat you up
is a bit of an exaggeration.

484
00:21:03,158 --> 00:21:05,797
I was trying to explain to you
when you flipped out.

485
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:07,568
‐Yeah, well, I've recently
sustained a head injury.

486
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:09,972
So please recap.
You're, uh, Cupid?

487
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:12,243
‐His apprentice.

488
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,715
‐Mm. Fat baby
in a diaper with wings?

489
00:21:14,782 --> 00:21:16,853
‐Well, he's not a baby anymore.

490
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:18,489
And for obvious reasons,

491
00:21:18,556 --> 00:21:20,927
HR convinced him to start
wearing pants a long time ago.

492
00:21:20,994 --> 00:21:22,263
But yeah.

493
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:24,467
‐So you're like a goddess.
‐Oh, no.

494
00:21:24,535 --> 00:21:26,906
‐No? [chuckles]
‐No, no.

495
00:21:26,973 --> 00:21:30,246
Oh, no.
Demigod, magical immortal,

496
00:21:30,312 --> 00:21:32,049
interfering
in the lives of humans,

497
00:21:32,116 --> 00:21:33,185
that kind of thing.

498
00:21:33,252 --> 00:21:35,189
‐[laughs]
Ruby the Immortal.

499
00:21:35,256 --> 00:21:38,328
‐My real name is Cherub.
But Ruby just has more zing.

500
00:21:38,395 --> 00:21:40,767
Don't you think?
‐Way more zing, yeah.

501
00:21:40,834 --> 00:21:43,873
And, um, I'm sorry,
but you're bothering me why?

502
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,209
‐I'm helping you.

503
00:21:45,276 --> 00:21:48,015
Helping you find love.

504
00:21:48,081 --> 00:21:52,925
‐O‐kay. Great.
Well, I'm a little tired, uh,

505
00:21:52,991 --> 00:21:55,496
so I'm going to go to bed.
But you can call me tomorrow,

506
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,066
and we'll schedule a little
love‐finding session.

507
00:21:57,133 --> 00:21:58,168
‐No time.

508
00:21:58,235 --> 00:21:59,470
We're on a ticking clock here.

509
00:21:59,538 --> 00:22:01,274
I have until midnight
on Christmas Eve

510
00:22:01,341 --> 00:22:03,312
to make you fall in love.

511
00:22:03,378 --> 00:22:05,316
‐Uh, Christmas isn't
even your holiday.

512
00:22:05,382 --> 00:22:07,654
‐I know. It's a
little arbitrary, but

513
00:22:07,721 --> 00:22:09,859
what are you gonna do?

514
00:22:09,925 --> 00:22:11,963
‐Why me?

515
00:22:12,029 --> 00:22:15,035
‐Well, because,
according to Cupid,

516
00:22:15,102 --> 00:22:21,081
you are the most romantically
hopeless person on Earth.

517
00:22:21,147 --> 00:22:24,989
‐[scoffs] On Earth?
Out of everyone? Really?

518
00:22:25,055 --> 00:22:26,592
Like not even just
the state of Virginia,

519
00:22:26,659 --> 00:22:27,594
but like all the states
everywhere,

520
00:22:27,661 --> 00:22:28,897
and all the countries?

521
00:22:28,963 --> 00:22:30,867
‐Yeah.

522
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:34,173
‐Wow! I've reached
an all‐new low.

523
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,146
[laughs] I just let the opinion
of an imaginary flying baby

524
00:22:37,213 --> 00:22:38,983
hurt my feelings.

525
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:40,787
‐You still
don't believe me, do you?

526
00:22:40,854 --> 00:22:44,394
‐No. No. That you're
a magical cherub? Not at all.

527
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,799
‐Okay. We have to fix that.

528
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,435
‐No.

529
00:22:48,503 --> 00:22:49,905
‐This might be
a little unnerving.

530
00:22:49,972 --> 00:22:50,941
‐Wait, wait, wait, what?

531
00:22:51,007 --> 00:22:52,678
[magical chimes]

532
00:22:52,744 --> 00:22:54,480
‐[Charlie gasps]
‐Take a look around.

533
00:22:54,548 --> 00:22:56,384
‐Wha.
‐What do you see?

534
00:22:56,451 --> 00:22:58,488
‐I'm in my underwear!

535
00:22:58,556 --> 00:22:59,959
[Ruby] Possibility!

536
00:23:00,025 --> 00:23:02,496
The possibility of love
around every corner.

537
00:23:02,564 --> 00:23:04,635
Hey, hey,
could she be the one?

538
00:23:04,702 --> 00:23:08,676
What about her?
What about him?

539
00:23:08,743 --> 00:23:11,782
The world is full of
romantic possibilities.

540
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:14,354
‐Did‐‐ did you drug me?
How did you get me here?

541
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,057
‐No wonder
you don't believe in love.

542
00:23:16,124 --> 00:23:17,393
You don't believe in magic.

543
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,197
‐This is insane!

544
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:20,466
Cupid is not real!

545
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:22,069
He's an antiquated idea

546
00:23:22,136 --> 00:23:23,706
that was repackaged by
the marketing department

547
00:23:23,773 --> 00:23:24,775
of some greeting card company.

‐Uh‐oh, fuzz!
‐[police car door closes]

550
00:23:27,146 --> 00:23:28,448
‐Hey, be cool.

551
00:23:28,516 --> 00:23:30,520
‐Uh, ma'am,
is this man bothering you?

552
00:23:30,587 --> 00:23:31,956
‐She's bothering me.

553
00:23:32,023 --> 00:23:35,362
She's a witch
or she's magic or something!

554
00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:36,599
‐You think you're dressed
appropriately

555
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:37,901
to be in a public area?

556
00:23:37,968 --> 00:23:39,805
‐Well, I'm.
obviously, Officer,

557
00:23:39,872 --> 00:23:41,341
if I'd known that I was going
to be magically transported,

558
00:23:41,408 --> 00:23:42,978
I would have put on pants.

559
00:23:43,045 --> 00:23:44,682
‐Okay, why don't you calm down
and come with me, all right?

560
00:23:44,748 --> 00:23:46,017
‐I can get you out of this,
Charlie.

561
00:23:46,084 --> 00:23:47,153
‐No, ma'am. You can't.

562
00:23:47,219 --> 00:23:48,188
‐Oh, okay.

563
00:23:48,255 --> 00:23:49,725
[whispered] I totally can.

564
00:23:49,792 --> 00:23:51,428
[Police officer] Sir, don't
make this difficult.

565
00:23:51,494 --> 00:23:54,133
‐Just promise
you'll try and find love.

566
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,539
‐I'm not gonna promise anything!
I just want to go home!

567
00:23:56,606 --> 00:23:59,377
‐Okay, so we'll do it
the hard way.

568
00:23:59,444 --> 00:24:00,479
[Charlie] I don't
want to fall in love.

569
00:24:00,547 --> 00:24:01,582
I got my classes and my books.

570
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:02,584
And that's all I need!

571
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:04,287
‐Good to know, pal.

572
00:24:04,354 --> 00:24:05,991
‐I have until Christmas Eve
to convince you you're wrong.

573
00:24:06,057 --> 00:24:08,596
‐Ma'am, can you
please step back?

574
00:24:08,663 --> 00:24:10,232
‐Okay, okay. Okay.
Okay. I give up.

575
00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:11,769
‐Say it!

576
00:24:11,836 --> 00:24:13,840
Say "I promise I'll do
whatever Ruby wants me to,

577
00:24:13,906 --> 00:24:15,677
so I can find love
and be happy!"

578
00:24:15,744 --> 00:24:18,015
‐Fine, fine. I promise I'll do
whatever Ruby wants me to do

579
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:19,618
so I can find love
and be happy.

580
00:24:19,685 --> 00:24:22,390
‐Wow, we got a couple of
real romantics here.

581
00:24:22,456 --> 00:24:23,993
‐But on one condition:

582
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,429
I'm not gonna have you tricking
me into falling in love.

583
00:24:25,496 --> 00:24:27,500
No. Magic.

584
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:29,304
‐Sure, pal. No magic.

585
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:30,740
‐You're really tying
my hands here, Charlie.

586
00:24:30,807 --> 00:24:33,045
[Charlie] Promise, or no deal!

587
00:24:33,111 --> 00:24:35,650
‐Okay, no magic.

588
00:24:37,688 --> 00:24:39,057
‐Don't worry, Romeo.

589
00:24:39,123 --> 00:24:41,328
Everything's gonna be just fine.

[exhales]

594
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:51,381
‐[magical chimes]
‐Hi!

595
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:53,018
‐Aah! [sighs]
Would you please

596
00:24:53,085 --> 00:24:55,255
stop popping up
everywhere like that?

597
00:24:55,322 --> 00:24:56,659
It's really disconcerting.

598
00:24:56,726 --> 00:24:58,362
‐I certainly don't
want you disconcerted,

599
00:24:58,428 --> 00:25:00,533
but we don't have time for
another little flip‐out, do we?

600
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,506
Charlie, you promised.

601
00:25:03,573 --> 00:25:05,476
‐I have class, Ruby. I teach.

602
00:25:05,543 --> 00:25:07,213
See, that's what I do.
That's my job.

603
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,983
Kind of like your job is
breaking into people's houses

604
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,319
and harassing them
until they agree

605
00:25:10,386 --> 00:25:11,756
to let you set them up on dates.

606
00:25:11,822 --> 00:25:13,225
‐Yeah, well, that's not
a fair assessment.

607
00:25:13,291 --> 00:25:14,828
‐Fine.

608
00:25:14,895 --> 00:25:16,264
Do your little
romance experiment

609
00:25:16,331 --> 00:25:19,571
after I'm done working, okay?
That's the deal.

610
00:25:19,638 --> 00:25:21,842
‐Well, how long will that be?

611
00:25:21,909 --> 00:25:23,880
‐I'll tell you what, go into
that building right there,

612
00:25:23,946 --> 00:25:25,984
talk to my boss,
tell her you work for Cupid,

613
00:25:26,051 --> 00:25:27,788
and that I need
some vacation days

614
00:25:27,854 --> 00:25:30,894
so that we can go on the hunt
for my perfect person.

615
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,697
I'm sure that'll go great
for you.

[magical chimes]

617
00:25:43,118 --> 00:25:44,287
‐Hi!

618
00:25:44,353 --> 00:25:46,659
‐[screams] Why did you
roll up on me like that?

619
00:25:46,726 --> 00:25:48,529
You just made me pee a little.

622
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,975
‐Okay, how did she
get in my office?

623
00:25:55,042 --> 00:25:56,579
‐How did you‐‐
‐You know what?

624
00:25:56,645 --> 00:25:58,516
Always on top of it,
right, Terry?

625
00:25:58,583 --> 00:26:00,352
Out!

626
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:02,557
Something wrong with that boy.

627
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,926
‐Are you Charlie's boss?

628
00:26:03,993 --> 00:26:05,429
‐Does he work
at this institution?

629
00:26:05,496 --> 00:26:06,999
‐[Ruby] Yes.
‐Then I'm his boss.

and I need your help.

‐[laughs] Girl, I got you.

634
00:26:17,621 --> 00:26:18,790
‐So in light of
that perspective,

635
00:26:18,856 --> 00:26:20,092
I'm curious to know what

636
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,494
your thoughts are.
‐[door opens]

Oh, hi. [chuckling]

639
00:26:27,741 --> 00:26:29,143
‐What are you doing here?

640
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,880
‐I did what you said.
I talked to your boss.

641
00:26:30,947 --> 00:26:32,349
‐I'm sorry, you did what?

642
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:35,557
‐Hey! Look at all your fresh,
young faces.

643
00:26:35,623 --> 00:26:38,663
Just learnin' and growin'
and gettin' smarter. [laughs]

644
00:26:38,729 --> 00:26:40,432
I feel good!
Y'all feel good?

‐Hi.
‐Oh.

Charlie.
Charlie‐Charlie‐Charlie.

649
00:26:46,111 --> 00:26:48,816
[giggles] Oh, honey,
please don't ever wear

650
00:26:48,883 --> 00:26:50,553
that shirt again.
That is an ugly shirt.

Oh, mm‐mm. No.

652
00:26:53,358 --> 00:26:55,395
‐Is there something that
I can help you with?

[Dean Wozniak] You sure can.

654
00:26:57,133 --> 00:26:59,203
Do you see this beautiful,
intelligent woman right here?

655
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,372
Ain't she pretty?

‐Um, well, I‐‐

657
00:27:01,542 --> 00:27:02,511
‐She's cute.

658
00:27:02,577 --> 00:27:03,679
‐Super hot.

659
00:27:03,746 --> 00:27:05,149
‐I don't see it.

‐[Charlie] Okay, okay.
‐This young lady. uh,

what's your name again,
sweetie?

‐Ruby Valentine.
‐Ruby Valentine! Yes.

663
00:27:09,825 --> 00:27:12,463
‐That's the most amazing
name I've ever heard.

664
00:27:12,531 --> 00:27:14,000
‐I'm a visiting professor,

665
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:15,703
and I'm here to oversee Charlie
and correct him

666
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:17,339
whenever he's wrong about stuff.

667
00:27:17,406 --> 00:27:19,978
And she's the boss and says
I can be here all the time

668
00:27:20,045 --> 00:27:21,882
and do anything I want. Right?

669
00:27:21,949 --> 00:27:23,753
‐Right, right.
I'm the boss.

670
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,790
Yes. She can be here
anytime she wants,

671
00:27:25,857 --> 00:27:26,759
she can be here
as long as she wants,

672
00:27:26,826 --> 00:27:27,861
and do what she wants.

673
00:27:27,928 --> 00:27:30,399
I have spoken! Yes. [laughs]

674
00:27:30,465 --> 00:27:32,102
Well, I'm gonna go take a nap,

675
00:27:32,169 --> 00:27:34,373
'cause whoo, I feel wonderful.
Don't y'all feel wonderful?

Did I say that already?
I don't know. [laughs]

I just feel good.

678
00:27:38,248 --> 00:27:39,651
And that's an ugly shirt. Ooo,
child, that's an ugly shirt.

Don't wear that tomorrow.

‐My job.
‐No, no.

682
00:27:43,626 --> 00:27:44,862
That's what I'm doing.

683
00:27:44,928 --> 00:27:46,364
What you're doing
is called stalking.

684
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:48,603
‐She's way too hot
to be stalking you.

685
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:49,705
‐Truth.

686
00:27:49,771 --> 00:27:51,809
‐You guys are so nice.

687
00:27:51,876 --> 00:27:54,882
‐Oh! You're that cop. [laughs]

688
00:27:54,948 --> 00:27:56,384
‐No.
‐[Patrick] I knew it.

689
00:28:00,425 --> 00:28:04,033
‐And that's how Napoleon and
Josephine fell in love.

690
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,373
‐So beautiful.

691
00:28:07,439 --> 00:28:10,345
‐I have to say this is the first
I've ever found history

692
00:28:10,412 --> 00:28:11,749
interesting in my life.

693
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,653
‐Okay, okay.
That's great. That's great.

694
00:28:13,719 --> 00:28:15,155
Can we all now
get back to the reason

695
00:28:15,222 --> 00:28:16,324
that we're actually here,
in the first place?

696
00:28:16,391 --> 00:28:18,028
‐Absolutely. Thank you

697
00:28:18,094 --> 00:28:19,297
for keeping us on track.
‐[Charlie clears throat]

698
00:28:19,363 --> 00:28:21,167
‐Who here thinks
Charlie is dateable?

699
00:28:21,234 --> 00:28:23,171
‐Whoa!
‐Show of hands.

700
00:28:23,238 --> 00:28:24,942
‐No, thi‐thi‐this
is totally inappropriate.

701
00:28:25,008 --> 00:28:26,545
Do not answer this‐‐

702
00:28:26,612 --> 00:28:30,252
‐He's cute. But there's
a lack of effort happening here.

703
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:33,826
‐Agreed. I mean,
did you sleep in those clothes?

704
00:28:33,893 --> 00:28:35,329
‐You should pay
more than six dollars

705
00:28:35,395 --> 00:28:36,565
for a haircut.

706
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,335
‐And you can be a bit.

707
00:28:38,401 --> 00:28:39,504
abrasive.

708
00:28:39,571 --> 00:28:40,907
‐All right!
‐See?

709
00:28:40,974 --> 00:28:43,679
‐That's a real turnoff,
Professor Conrad.

710
00:28:43,746 --> 00:28:45,215
‐[gasps]
Step one in finding you love

711
00:28:45,282 --> 00:28:46,952
should be a makeover.
‐Yeah, I'm not doing that.

712
00:28:47,019 --> 00:28:49,858
‐You promised.
Okay, whatever it takes.

713
00:28:49,925 --> 00:28:51,160
The quicker you find love,

714
00:28:51,227 --> 00:28:52,631
the quicker
I'll be out of your life.

715
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:54,568
[Patrick] I don't get it.

716
00:28:54,635 --> 00:28:56,404
What are you guys talking about?

717
00:28:56,471 --> 00:28:59,210
‐Class project!
I'm gonna need all your help.

718
00:28:59,277 --> 00:29:01,515
I'm a bit out of the loop
with modern dating

719
00:29:01,582 --> 00:29:04,755
and Charlie here needs
all the help he can get.

720
00:29:04,821 --> 00:29:06,592
‐We're trying to set
Professor Conrad up

721
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:07,727
like on a date?

722
00:29:07,794 --> 00:29:09,898
‐More than that! Love.

723
00:29:09,965 --> 00:29:11,367
[Gina] Love is a myth.

724
00:29:11,434 --> 00:29:12,537
It's simply our brain chemistry
tricking us

725
00:29:12,604 --> 00:29:13,739
to propagate the species.

726
00:29:13,806 --> 00:29:15,510
‐Thank you, Gina.

727
00:29:15,576 --> 00:29:18,348
‐Okay, you're my next project,
but let's stay focused, okay?

728
00:29:18,415 --> 00:29:20,853
We have ten days
to find love for Charlie.

729
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,993
I'm open to any
and all suggestions. Go!

730
00:29:27,834 --> 00:29:29,103
[Raif] I mean.

731
00:29:30,238 --> 00:29:32,209
there's like a thousand apps.

732
00:29:32,276 --> 00:29:34,881
‐Ooh, apps.

733
00:29:34,948 --> 00:29:39,123
Applications on the computer.
Intriguing.

734
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,494
Uh, personally,
I've always avoided them.

735
00:29:41,562 --> 00:29:43,633
You know, I like to take
a more hands‐on approach,

736
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:45,870
but desperate times
call for desperate measures.

737
00:29:45,937 --> 00:29:47,039
‐All right, class is over.

738
00:29:47,106 --> 00:29:48,542
‐What about your dating profile?

739
00:29:48,609 --> 00:29:50,647
‐Multiple photos and a bio?

740
00:29:50,713 --> 00:29:53,686
Are you sure you're ready for
this level of self‐marketing?

741
00:29:53,753 --> 00:29:55,757
‐And don't forget
photo touch‐ups.

742
00:29:55,823 --> 00:29:58,461
Trust me.
I don't think you want to post

743
00:29:58,529 --> 00:30:00,065
an unedited photo.

744
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:01,935
‐They're right.
We need their help.

745
00:30:06,512 --> 00:30:07,681
‐They have other classes.

746
00:30:07,747 --> 00:30:08,783
‐No, I'm‐‐ I'm free.

747
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:09,985
‐I can skip.

748
00:30:10,052 --> 00:30:12,423
‐This is way more interesting.

749
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:19,203
[wind blowing]

750
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:21,240
[Natalie] Build?

751
00:30:21,307 --> 00:30:22,644
‐Skinny?

752
00:30:22,711 --> 00:30:23,979
‐Frail?

753
00:30:24,046 --> 00:30:25,817
[Patrick] He's got some
tone to him, but

754
00:30:25,883 --> 00:30:27,721
it wouldn't kill you
to hit the gym.

755
00:30:27,787 --> 00:30:29,090
‐So, athletic.

756
00:30:29,156 --> 00:30:31,595
‐Let's not get crazy.

757
00:30:31,662 --> 00:30:32,731
[Gina] He's tall.

758
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:33,966
‐Boom.
‐That means a lot.

759
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:35,168
‐It means everything.

760
00:30:35,235 --> 00:30:37,072
Can't we just put
that he's tall

761
00:30:37,139 --> 00:30:39,443
and leave out
all the personality bits?

762
00:30:39,511 --> 00:30:41,114
‐Wow. This is a new level
of humiliation for me,

763
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,784
so thanks for that, guys.

764
00:30:42,851 --> 00:30:44,688
‐Oh, toughen up.

765
00:30:44,755 --> 00:30:46,224
[Emily] So what are your
interests?

766
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:49,296
‐And let's stay away from
the boring ones, shall we?

767
00:30:49,363 --> 00:30:50,566
‐You know what,
I really don't need you guys

768
00:30:50,633 --> 00:30:52,036
to make a dating app for me.

769
00:30:52,102 --> 00:30:55,977
‐It's actually a dating profile,
and yes, you do.

770
00:30:56,044 --> 00:30:57,179
‐Well, whatever it's called,

771
00:30:57,246 --> 00:30:58,649
I don't need it,
I don't want it.

772
00:30:58,716 --> 00:31:00,853
So you guys can just do
whatever you want to do.

773
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,724
I don't care.

774
00:31:02,791 --> 00:31:04,326
Bye.

775
00:31:04,393 --> 00:31:07,366
‐Oh, you should add
that he's fiery and passionate.

776
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:10,405
‐[Natalie] Oh.
‐[Gina] Ooh, I like that.

777
00:31:10,472 --> 00:31:11,775
‐I don't get it.

778
00:31:11,842 --> 00:31:13,713
What kind of person
doesn't want to fall in love?

779
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:14,981
‐The damaged kind.

780
00:31:15,048 --> 00:31:15,950
‐Oh, no, no, no.
Put that, put that.

781
00:31:16,017 --> 00:31:17,186
We love damage.

782
00:31:18,388 --> 00:31:19,390
‐All done.

783
00:31:20,626 --> 00:31:21,995
[Chloe] That's really good.

784
00:31:22,062 --> 00:31:23,431
You know, if I saw that,
I would actually think

785
00:31:23,498 --> 00:31:24,433
he's kind of cute.

786
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,572
[laughing]

787
00:31:26,638 --> 00:31:28,341
Oh, which is gross.

788
00:31:28,408 --> 00:31:29,845
[Ruby] Post it!

789
00:31:29,911 --> 00:31:31,314
Any girl would look at this
and want a date with Charlie.

790
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,218
‐Plus, it's cuffing season.

791
00:31:33,284 --> 00:31:34,755
Standards are as low
as they get all year.

792
00:31:34,821 --> 00:31:38,027
‐Right. Wait, what?

793
00:31:38,094 --> 00:31:40,232
Too high maintenance.

794
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:42,035
Too fun.

795
00:31:42,102 --> 00:31:44,140
Too cool.
‐[soft tinkle]

796
00:31:44,206 --> 00:31:46,144
‐Being a little picky,
aren't we?

797
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:47,614
‐Okay, not that it's
any of your business,

798
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,918
but I'm trying to find
the right woman for him.

799
00:31:49,985 --> 00:31:51,254
‐[gasping] Right.

800
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,158
The same way that
you've always done it.

801
00:31:53,224 --> 00:31:56,598
Taking your time, choosing
nothing but the best candidates.

802
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:58,602
You want my advice?

803
00:31:58,669 --> 00:31:59,938
‐Not really.

804
00:32:00,005 --> 00:32:01,642
‐Ruby, you have to go all in.

805
00:32:01,708 --> 00:32:03,612
Find him as many possibilities
as you can.

806
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:05,115
This is a numbers game.

807
00:32:05,182 --> 00:32:07,319
‐Oh, just match him
with everyone willy‐nilly?

808
00:32:07,386 --> 00:32:09,390
I'm not gonna do that.
That's not how I operate.

809
00:32:09,457 --> 00:32:11,194
‐Well, that's exactly why
your job is on the line,

810
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,630
in the first place.

811
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:15,570
[chuckles] Same old Ruby,
same old mistakes.

812
00:32:15,636 --> 00:32:17,640
But, look, all right, whatever.
I mean, what do I care?

813
00:32:17,707 --> 00:32:19,978
Do it your way.
I'm just trying to help you.

814
00:32:21,849 --> 00:32:23,451
‐Philomena?

815
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,424
Do you know
what cuffing season is?

816
00:32:26,491 --> 00:32:28,361
‐You don't?

817
00:32:28,428 --> 00:32:31,334
And you're next in line
to be the God of Love?

818
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,506
Wow, I cannot.
I will see you upstairs.

819
00:32:35,041 --> 00:32:36,477
[soft tinkle]

820
00:32:37,814 --> 00:32:39,618
‐Argh! Whatever.

821
00:32:41,387 --> 00:32:45,563
Like. Like. Like. Like. Like.

822
00:32:46,765 --> 00:32:49,771
[peppy music]

823
00:32:49,838 --> 00:32:51,942
‐I can't believe
I'm on a date with a teacher.

824
00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:56,250
I mean, I feel like
I just graduated.

825
00:32:56,317 --> 00:32:57,987
‐Wh‐when exactly was that?

826
00:32:58,054 --> 00:33:00,626
‐Oh, months and months ago.

827
00:33:00,693 --> 00:33:01,795
‐Hmm.

828
00:33:01,862 --> 00:33:03,398
[Skylar]
This drink is delish!

829
00:33:04,901 --> 00:33:06,137
[Charlie chuckling softly]

830
00:33:07,272 --> 00:33:08,943
‐We're all gonna die someday.

831
00:33:09,009 --> 00:33:11,849
So what's the point, right?

832
00:33:11,915 --> 00:33:13,151
‐That's pretty dark.

833
00:33:13,218 --> 00:33:16,023
‐I mean, look at us.
Two lonely people

834
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:18,127
desperately seeking
companionship

835
00:33:18,194 --> 00:33:20,700
when in the end,
we're all just gonna die alone.

836
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:21,735
‐Okay.

837
00:33:24,741 --> 00:33:26,143
‐I don't want to waste your time

838
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:28,281
and I certainly don't
want you wasting mine.

839
00:33:28,348 --> 00:33:30,620
I want a husband. I want kids.

840
00:33:30,686 --> 00:33:32,322
I want a big weddin'.

841
00:33:32,389 --> 00:33:35,696
And I want a year‐long
engagement with a big ring.

842
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,967
And if I want all of
these things, which I do,

843
00:33:38,034 --> 00:33:39,671
then I need to move quickly.

844
00:33:39,738 --> 00:33:41,140
Could you see yourself
proposing to me

845
00:33:41,207 --> 00:33:42,677
in the next three to six months?

846
00:33:42,744 --> 00:33:43,746
[Charlie gulping]

847
00:33:43,812 --> 00:33:44,681
[glass thuds]

848
00:33:44,748 --> 00:33:46,384
[Charlie exhales]

849
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:47,854
[Ruby scratching on paper]

850
00:33:47,921 --> 00:33:49,189
[Leslie] So, this is Alfie.

851
00:33:49,256 --> 00:33:51,427
He is so bad.

852
00:33:51,494 --> 00:33:53,264
This is Josephine.
‐[Charlie laughing]

853
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:54,901
How many cats do you have?

854
00:33:54,968 --> 00:33:56,270
[Leslie] Twelve.

855
00:33:56,337 --> 00:33:58,976
There are five more
outdoor babies but

856
00:33:59,043 --> 00:34:01,414
they're not really mine, per se.
‐Hm.

857
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,951
‐You have a lot more
women coming?

858
00:34:03,017 --> 00:34:04,854
Because my shift
is almost over.

859
00:34:04,921 --> 00:34:06,157
‐More women?

860
00:34:06,224 --> 00:34:09,330
‐Casanova has been here
for hours.

861
00:34:09,396 --> 00:34:12,837
[chatter in background]

862
00:34:12,904 --> 00:34:15,041
‐I think she's just upset 'cause
I've had four blind dates

863
00:34:15,108 --> 00:34:16,545
and then all I've ordered
is water.

864
00:34:16,612 --> 00:34:18,314
[Leslie] Tonight?

865
00:34:18,381 --> 00:34:20,218
‐[breathing deep]
Christmas is in a week.

866
00:34:20,285 --> 00:34:21,688
‐Don't want to be alone
on Christmas?

867
00:34:21,755 --> 00:34:22,924
‐Hm.

868
00:34:22,991 --> 00:34:24,426
‐I get it.
It's cuffing season.

869
00:34:24,493 --> 00:34:26,264
‐You know, I don't know
what that means.

870
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,934
And I'd be fine to be alone
except that somehow

871

I've managed to become
part of a giant cosmic bet.

See that woman over there

00:34:32,677 --> 00:34:33,679
sliding down on her seat?

874
00:34:33,746 --> 00:34:35,215
Yeah, that's Cupid.

875
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:38,488
Or Cupid's assistant. Hey,
are you his assistant?

‐What?

877
00:34:41,494 --> 00:34:43,097
‐Cupid set us up
using a dating app?

878

‐[laughs] I know, right?

879
00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:46,605
I told her she couldn't
use any magic, though,

880
00:34:46,672 --> 00:34:48,408
and she only has a week to make
me fall in love by Christmas.

Valentine's Day?

No. Christmas. [laughs]

884
00:34:53,184 --> 00:34:54,921
Apparently, Cupid wants to
spend the holiday on his boat

or something. I don't‐‐
‐Charlie! You're talking crazy!

That's her name.

887
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:00,933
But she goes by Ruby
because it's got more zing.

Hey, disappear or shoot
an arrow or something.

You know what?
I'm leaving.

That's it for me.
I am out of here.

895

And you're not getting
20 percent,

you're getting 15 max.

Leslie, I'm so sorry.
You've been lovely.

898

This has nothing to do
with you but I have to go.

‐So, you really think
you're Cupid?

901

‐Ah‐‐ do I look like
a Looney Tunes?

I mean, like, here's my
little bow and arrow. Pew!

Of course not.

904

I'm just really
great at matchmaking.

I think that guy over there.

908
00:35:54,574 --> 00:35:55,910
I think he might be the one.

909
00:35:57,179 --> 00:35:59,183
Maybe I could introduce you.

910
00:35:59,249 --> 00:36:01,187

We have a deal.

which I am not.
‐But why? Why, Charlie?

919
00:36:22,663 --> 00:36:24,466
Why don't you want to find love?

920
00:36:24,534 --> 00:36:27,205
‐You really want to know why?
Okay, fine. I'll tell you.

921

And now I'm just me.

927
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:44,974
And I have finally
gotten used to that.

928
00:36:45,041 --> 00:36:47,847
And then you come around here
messing with my head.

929
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:50,920
But I don't want to change.

‐Yes. You told me
I should play a numbers game!

937

That's why I chose
all those random women. [gasps]

938
00:37:20,546 --> 00:37:22,482
You did this on purpose.

939
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:25,355

I'm helping me.

Mister C about this, hm?

Everybody loves a tattletale.

As a matter of fact,
that's why I'm here.

00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,951
‐Yikes.

1042
00:41:17,018 --> 00:41:19,657
‐Yeah. So, since then,
for my own sanity,

1043
00:41:19,724 --> 00:41:21,060
and really as a public service,

1044
00:41:21,126 --> 00:41:23,565
I have decided to
stay away from the whole,

1045
00:41:23,632 --> 00:41:26,604
like, love romance thing.

1046
00:41:26,671 --> 00:41:29,242
That is how I became
the undatable man.

1047
00:41:29,309 --> 00:41:30,946
‐You're not undatable.

1048
00:41:31,013 --> 00:41:35,823
You're smart, sensitive,
a great teacher.

1049
00:41:35,889 --> 00:41:39,664
And when you're not mad at me,
you're really nice.

1050
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,939
Plus, you're actually
super cute.

1051
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,817
‐Really?

1052
00:41:49,884 --> 00:41:51,621
Really? Super cute?
‐[chuckling] Yeah.

1053
00:41:51,688 --> 00:41:53,290
Oh, no, I, uh‐‐
‐Super?

1054
00:41:53,357 --> 00:41:56,130
‐Just like a regular, just
a normal amount of‐‐ of cute.

1055
00:41:56,196 --> 00:41:58,535
‐Mm. It sounds like
you think I'm dreamy.

1056
00:41:58,602 --> 00:42:00,806
‐Maybe this is why you don't
get compliments very often.

1057
00:42:00,873 --> 00:42:02,877
The point is,
we need to find someone

1058
00:42:02,943 --> 00:42:05,649
who sees you the way I do.

1059
00:42:05,716 --> 00:42:07,920
‐And how do we do that?

1060
00:42:07,987 --> 00:42:10,592
‐Well, I need to know
who I'm looking for.

1061
00:42:10,659 --> 00:42:12,495
And in order to figure that out.

1062
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:13,832
‐Oh, boy.

1063
00:42:13,899 --> 00:42:15,234
‐.you gotta hang out with me.

1064
00:42:16,771 --> 00:42:18,474
We are on a mission, people.

1065
00:42:18,542 --> 00:42:21,413
We need to find the perfect
person for Professor Conrad.

1066
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,618
Leave no stone unturned!

1067
00:42:23,685 --> 00:42:25,455
Also, I just really
need to know,

1068
00:42:25,522 --> 00:42:27,058
what is cuffing season?

1069
00:42:27,125 --> 00:42:30,031
Cuffing season is that time,
usually October to March,

1070
00:42:30,098 --> 00:42:32,202
where people go looking
for a boyfriend or

1071
00:42:32,268 --> 00:42:33,304
girlfriend for the holidays.

1072
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:35,308
And because it's cold outside.

1073
00:42:35,374 --> 00:42:36,878
‐Yeah, that's kind of gross.

1074
00:42:36,945 --> 00:42:39,249
‐What? No! I‐‐ maybe
I'm not explainin' it right.

1075
00:42:39,316 --> 00:42:41,386
See, if you're single
for the holidays‐‐

1076
00:42:41,453 --> 00:42:43,224
‐You don't have anybody
to invite to a family

1077
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:45,796
Thanksgiving dinner,
or get Christmas presents from,

1078
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:48,635
or have a date for New Year's,
Valentine's Day.

1079
00:42:48,702 --> 00:42:50,806
So cuffing season
is actually intentionally

1080
00:42:50,873 --> 00:42:52,510
lowering your standards
so as not to be alone

1081
00:42:52,576 --> 00:42:54,112
because that would be
the real tragedy.

1082
00:42:54,179 --> 00:42:55,682
["Christmas in the Air"
playing in the background]

1083
00:42:55,749 --> 00:42:58,254
‐It is kind of gross.

1084
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,657
I don't mean to bother you guys,

1085
00:42:59,724 --> 00:43:01,260
but do you have a daughter?

1086
00:43:01,326 --> 00:43:03,130
‐Uh, excuse me. I have
a very important and pressing

1087
00:43:03,197 --> 00:43:04,466
question for you.

1088
00:43:04,534 --> 00:43:05,736

‐Wow. What does, uh.
what does a yellow arrow do?

1106
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:56,604
‐Yellow will make you
notice someone.

1107
00:43:56,671 --> 00:44:00,646
Purple will make you feel all
lovey and happy and dopey.

1108
00:44:00,712 --> 00:44:02,348
‐That's the one
you used on my boss.

Red is for emergencies only.

It makes people do crazy things.

00:44:13,103 --> 00:44:15,341
Yeah! It's a sign from Cupid.
We're on the right track!

1114
00:44:17,011 --> 00:44:18,815
‐It's a sign
from the Tourism Bureau.

1115
00:44:19,951 --> 00:44:21,521
‐Hey.
‐Hm?

1116
00:44:21,588 --> 00:44:23,324
‐You're really good at your job.

1117
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:25,863
‐I think you're probably
really good at what you do too.

1118
00:44:27,198 --> 00:44:29,269
‐Thank you. I, uh,
I appreciate hearing that.

1119
00:44:29,336 --> 00:44:31,340
I've just been having
some trouble at work,

1120
00:44:31,406 --> 00:44:32,910
and I think my boss
hates me, and‐‐

‐Hm.

‐Just to reiterate,
this is magic.

1124
00:44:43,665 --> 00:44:46,804
You're not allowed to use
an arrow on me or anybody else.

1125
00:44:46,871 --> 00:44:48,340
‐You know, you're really
making this more difficult

1126
00:44:48,407 --> 00:44:50,746
than it needs to be,
but I promised.

1127
00:44:50,812 --> 00:44:52,516
No magic.

1128
00:44:52,583 --> 00:44:53,985
[Charlie]
So what about you?

1129
00:44:54,052 --> 00:44:56,023
Four days until Christmas.

1130
00:44:56,089 --> 00:44:57,826
You got a special someone?

1131
00:44:57,893 --> 00:44:59,062
‐I'm immortal.

1132
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:01,166
‐Hm. Too long a commitment?

1133
00:45:01,233 --> 00:45:02,135
‐Funny guy.

1134
00:45:03,237 --> 00:45:04,740
I would imagine
the dating pool

1135
00:45:04,807 --> 00:45:06,811
of dudes who live forever
is pretty shallow.

1136
00:45:06,878 --> 00:45:08,815
‐It just doesn't work like that.

1137
00:45:08,882 --> 00:45:10,351
I get to make people
fall in love,

1138
00:45:10,418 --> 00:45:12,590
but I just don't get to.

1139
00:45:12,656 --> 00:45:13,758
‐What?

1140
00:45:14,727 --> 00:45:15,929
Really?

1141
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:18,300

1142
00:45:18,367 --> 00:45:19,570
‐Apprentice.

1143

‐Miss "I love love."

Miss "There's a perfect person
for everybody."

1145

You've never had a boyfriend?

1146
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:29,155
‐Never been on a date.
Never been kissed.

1147
00:45:29,222 --> 00:45:31,026
‐But I bet it's really nice.

1148
00:45:31,093 --> 00:45:33,364
‐[inhales deeply] I guess
I finally found the one thing

1149
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:34,700
we have in common.

1150
00:45:34,767 --> 00:45:36,103
‐You've never been kissed,
either?

1151
00:45:36,169 --> 00:45:37,673
‐What? No.

1152
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:40,244
Yes, yes. Yes.
I've been kissed.

1153
00:45:40,311 --> 00:45:42,950
‐It's okay if you haven't.
‐No, I‐I‐I have been kissed.

1154
00:45:43,017 --> 00:45:45,154
I've‐‐ I have done
the kissing, all right?

1155
00:45:45,221 --> 00:45:46,524
And also received the kissing.

1156
00:45:46,591 --> 00:45:47,927
Whatever!
That's not what I meant.

1157
00:45:47,993 --> 00:45:49,563
I meant, it just seems
like we've both

1158
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:52,468
put our professional lives
ahead of our personal lives.

1159
00:45:52,536 --> 00:45:55,474
[inhales deeply] That's
the thing we have in common.

1160
00:45:56,978 --> 00:45:58,748
‐Sounds like I hit a nerve.

1161
00:45:58,815 --> 00:46:00,117
‐You didn't hit.

00:46:03,892 --> 00:46:04,927
‐Hey, Gina. I‐‐

‐Stop it!

1165
00:46:08,067 --> 00:46:10,772
‐I, uh. was wondering
if you wanted to‐‐

1166

‐Wait! Stop.

1167
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:15,882
Oh, my god.

00:46:15,949 --> 00:46:17,653
Who is that?

1169
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,489
‐I know her.

1170
00:46:19,557 --> 00:46:21,594
She taught me Intro to Theatre.

‐She's totally his type.

1172
00:46:23,732 --> 00:46:25,434
And she's reading a book.

‐Don't do that.

‐Meet Amber McCormick,
professor of theatre.

She likes to read, especially
the works of Jane Austen.

‐She's a romantic.

00:46:46,209 --> 00:46:47,913
‐Pretty.
‐[scoffs] Pretty.

1182
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:50,852
‐She's hot. Hot!

1183
00:46:50,919 --> 00:46:51,854
‐She's not uptight.

1184
00:46:51,921 --> 00:46:53,490
She's like, laid back.

1185
00:46:53,558 --> 00:46:55,061
She's not like, professor.

1186
00:46:55,127 --> 00:46:56,631
‐She's like‐‐
‐Right.

1187
00:46:56,698 --> 00:46:58,400
‐Call me Amber.
Like casual.

1188
00:46:58,467 --> 00:46:59,436
‐Oh, like boho.

1189
00:46:59,502 --> 00:47:01,507
‐Yes! Yes!
‐Oh, yeah, yeah.

1190
00:47:01,574 --> 00:47:03,043
‐So, what do you think?

1191
00:47:04,379 --> 00:47:05,916
‐What do you mean,
what do I think?

1192
00:47:05,982 --> 00:47:07,185
What, I'm supposed to
just look at this

1193
00:47:07,251 --> 00:47:08,655
and tell you
if I would date someone?

1194
00:47:08,722 --> 00:47:09,990
‐[Gina] Yeah.
‐[Raif] Yeah.

1195
00:47:10,057 --> 00:47:11,928
‐No. No, no, no, no.

1196
00:47:11,994 --> 00:47:15,234
You need to talk to her.
See if there's a spark.

1197
00:47:15,301 --> 00:47:18,407
Then you just need to
follow your heart.

1198
00:47:18,474 --> 00:47:20,411
‐Follow my heart, huh?
‐Mm‐hm.

1199
00:47:20,478 --> 00:47:22,950
That's the key
to all of this, Charlie.

1200
00:47:23,017 --> 00:47:25,154
Ooh! Brainstorm!

1201
00:47:25,221 --> 00:47:28,127
I know what we need.
We need a meet‐cute.

1202
00:47:28,193 --> 00:47:29,864
‐[gasps] Yes, yes.
‐What's a meet‐cute?

1203
00:47:32,001 --> 00:47:33,905
‐All right,
so what are we doing?

1204
00:47:33,972 --> 00:47:36,343
‐Okay. A meet‐cute
is that part of the movie

1205
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:38,080
where the girl and the boy
meet for the first time,

1206
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:39,750
and it's usually
silly or awkward,

1207
00:47:39,817 --> 00:47:42,355
but it's just so darn cute.

1208
00:47:42,422 --> 00:47:43,992
‐That sounds
pretty contrived to me.

1209

‐Well, good,
because that was our deal.

‐But that means that you need to
stop complaining for one second

and just get on board with this.

‐You did it, Charlie.
You got a date.

‐Yeah. She probably only agreed
to go out with me

for maiming me.

‐Yeah, probably.

‐It's just that I've made it
happen so many times.

tomorrow night, so.

1381
00:54:58,794 --> 00:54:59,696
We'll see.

1382
00:55:01,366 --> 00:55:02,468
Goof on outta here.

1383
00:55:06,911 --> 00:55:08,748
All right. You're gonna
have an hour with this,

1384
00:55:08,815 --> 00:55:12,488
which should be plenty of time,
if you studied.

1385
00:55:14,292 --> 00:55:16,229
‐You're not gonna tell us
how it went?

1386
00:55:16,296 --> 00:55:18,433
‐Oh, we absolutely
need details.

1387
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,870
‐Was it a love connection?

1388
00:55:19,937 --> 00:55:21,139
[Emily]
Are you going to see her again?

1389
00:55:21,206 --> 00:55:23,611
‐Did you spill anything?

1390
00:55:23,678 --> 00:55:27,886
‐Ha, ha, ha.
It was, uh, it was good.

1391
00:55:27,953 --> 00:55:29,823
Dunno yet.
We have a date tomorrow night.

1392
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:32,729
And yes, I did spill
something, coffee.

1393
00:55:32,796 --> 00:55:34,800
But, good news is,
not on her.

1394
00:55:34,867 --> 00:55:35,835
[Chloe clapping]

1395
00:55:35,902 --> 00:55:37,806
‐All right.
Anyway, good luck.

1396
00:55:37,873 --> 00:55:39,710
Soon as you're done,
you can leave.

1397
00:55:39,776 --> 00:55:41,714
And uh, safe travels and have
a great Christmas, you guys.

1398
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:43,383
‐You can't possibly believe

1399
00:55:43,450 --> 00:55:45,655
that we're gonna leave
before Christmas Eve.

1400
00:55:45,722 --> 00:55:49,061
‐Like we would come this far
and then not see how it ends up?

1401
00:55:49,128 --> 00:55:50,097
‐What do you mean?

1402
00:55:50,163 --> 00:55:51,499
‐The bet?

1403
00:55:51,567 --> 00:55:55,040
You have to fall in love
by Christmas Eve or.

1404
00:55:55,107 --> 00:55:56,577
well, something happens.

1405
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:58,581
‐Yeah, I'm not really clear
on the consequences.

1406
00:55:58,648 --> 00:56:01,720
‐We wanna see if you make it.

1407
00:56:01,787 --> 00:56:03,824
‐Don't you guys wanna go home
and see your families?

1408
00:56:03,891 --> 00:56:06,429
‐[chuckles] After all the work
that I've put into this project,

1409
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:08,801
do you think
I'm just gonna walk away?

1410
00:56:08,868 --> 00:56:11,139
‐Professor Conrad,
we're invested in this.

1411
00:56:11,206 --> 00:56:12,842
‐I'm not convinced
it's going to happen,

1412
00:56:12,909 --> 00:56:15,480
but I'm definitely
sticking around to see.

1413
00:56:15,548 --> 00:56:16,550
‐Plus, the Christmas Eve

1414
00:56:16,617 --> 00:56:19,055
gala is super fun!

1415
00:56:19,121 --> 00:56:22,361
‐[sighs] Great. Just great.

1416
00:56:22,428 --> 00:56:25,835
[soft music]

1417
00:56:25,902 --> 00:56:27,505
[Cupid] Hey!

1418
00:56:27,572 --> 00:56:30,377
[snaps fingers] You with me?

1419
00:56:30,444 --> 00:56:31,714
‐Yes, of course.

1420
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:33,083
‐So, Philomena says
you have this

1421
00:56:33,149 --> 00:56:34,418
whole thing wrapped up, huh?

1422
00:56:34,485 --> 00:56:36,590
‐Yeah. It's looking good.

1423
00:56:36,657 --> 00:56:38,561
‐Care to expound?
Is he in love?

1424
00:56:38,628 --> 00:56:41,065
‐No! Not yet.

1425
00:56:41,132 --> 00:56:43,403
You know, we don't want to
rush into anything.

1426
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:45,440
‐Rush into anything?

1427
00:56:45,508 --> 00:56:47,812
You got three days.

1428
00:56:47,879 --> 00:56:49,315
Three days until Christmas.

1429
00:56:49,382 --> 00:56:50,919
I'm gonna have
my Christmas, Ruby.

1430
00:56:50,985 --> 00:56:54,325
‐I'm just not entirely,
totally certain

1431
00:56:54,392 --> 00:56:57,398
that she's the one.

1432
00:56:57,464 --> 00:56:58,400
‐You're not?

1433
00:56:58,466 --> 00:57:00,370
‐Yeah.

1434
00:57:00,437 --> 00:57:01,807
‐You're not by any chance

1435
00:57:01,874 --> 00:57:03,310
having any feelings
for this guy, are you?

1436
00:57:03,376 --> 00:57:05,280
‐What? No. [scoffs]
No, that's crazy.

1437
00:57:05,347 --> 00:57:06,449
‐Because you know that
you're not allowed to‐‐

1438
00:57:06,517 --> 00:57:09,656
‐I know. It can't happen.

1439
00:57:11,827 --> 00:57:13,430
I just want him to be happy.

1440
00:57:15,067 --> 00:57:15,969
That's all.

1441
00:57:22,616 --> 00:57:24,085
[knock on door]

1442
00:57:24,151 --> 00:57:25,989
‐Professor Conrad.

1443
00:57:26,055 --> 00:57:28,093
‐You, uh, heading out
for the break?

1444
00:57:28,159 --> 00:57:30,598
‐Oh, yes, I'm trying to
head out right now.

1445
00:57:30,665 --> 00:57:32,067
Tomorrow is the Christmas gala,

1446
00:57:32,134 --> 00:57:35,541
and then two beautiful weeks
student‐free.

1447
00:57:35,608 --> 00:57:37,378
Just me, my kids,
and my boo.

1448
00:57:37,444 --> 00:57:38,614
‐Uh, it sounds nice.

1449
00:57:38,681 --> 00:57:40,050
‐Hmm. You have any plans?

1450
00:57:40,117 --> 00:57:43,089
‐I‐I‐I really don't have
"a boo", or a family,

1451
00:57:43,156 --> 00:57:45,093
uh, so I usually just spend
Christmas Day

1452
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:47,899
volunteering at a soup kitchen.
And then, I think this year‐‐

1453
00:57:47,966 --> 00:57:49,235
I think I'm gonna
go up to the lake

1454
00:57:49,301 --> 00:57:50,638
and spend some alone time.

1455
00:57:50,705 --> 00:57:52,207
‐Okay, that sounds depressing.

1456
00:57:52,274 --> 00:57:54,713
[laughs] Something you need?

1457
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:57,552
‐Oh, I‐‐ look,
I don't wanna keep you.

1458
00:57:57,619 --> 00:57:59,322
‐You know what?
Too late.

1459
00:57:59,388 --> 00:58:00,925
What do you want?

1460
00:58:00,992 --> 00:58:02,662
‐Right. Um.

1461
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:04,432
do you remember Ruby?

1462
00:58:04,498 --> 00:58:07,237
The girl that you said could be
in my classroom all the time?

1463
00:58:07,304 --> 00:58:09,976
Oh. The visiting professor,
or something.

1464
00:58:10,043 --> 00:58:11,914
What about her?
‐Yeah. Well, the thing is,

1465
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:15,253
uh, we're from two completely
different worlds.

1466
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,690
And we have nothing in common.

1467
00:58:16,757 --> 00:58:18,594
And she's always pushing me
to be different‐‐

1468
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:20,665
‐[chuckles] You like her.

1469
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:24,539
‐I don't know.

1470
00:58:26,242 --> 00:58:27,846
There's this other girl.

1471
00:58:27,912 --> 00:58:33,524
Um, she's smart and pretty,
and we have a lot in common.

1472
00:58:33,591 --> 00:58:35,293
‐Professor Conrad,
let me tell you

1473
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,231
a little something about love.

1474
00:58:37,297 --> 00:58:40,671
See, love will have you
thinkin' about 'em all the time.

1475
00:58:40,738 --> 00:58:42,274
Love will have you gettin'
that knot in your stomach

1476
00:58:42,341 --> 00:58:43,944
whenever you're around 'em.

1477
00:58:44,011 --> 00:58:45,681
Love will have you
goin' to bed at night

1478
00:58:45,748 --> 00:58:47,217
thinking about 'em,
and waking up in the morning

1479
00:58:47,284 --> 00:58:49,455
and hoping you see 'em.
See, sometimes with love,

1480
00:58:49,523 --> 00:58:51,593
you just gotta go with it.

1481
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:54,633
Life is too short
to settle for anyone

1482
00:58:54,699 --> 00:58:57,806
or anything that doesn't
make you feel like that.

1483
00:58:58,941 --> 00:59:00,745
‐But.

1484
00:59:00,812 --> 00:59:02,147
Ruby and I don't make sense.

1485
00:59:02,214 --> 00:59:05,120
‐[laughs] Ah!
Love don't make sense.

1486
00:59:05,187 --> 00:59:07,391
You just gotta
follow your heart.

1487
00:59:07,458 --> 00:59:08,561
‐Follow my heart.

1488
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:11,633
You're the second person
to tell me that this week.

1489
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:13,503
‐Well, it's good advice.

1490
00:59:13,571 --> 00:59:15,775
Now, if it's
all right with you,

1491
00:59:15,842 --> 00:59:18,279
and now that I've solved
all your love problems‐‐

1492
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:19,716
I wanna go home!

1493
00:59:19,783 --> 00:59:21,553
‐Yes! Sure. Sorry.
‐[Dean Wozniak] Okay.

1494
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:22,789
I'll see you tomorrow
at the gala.

1495
00:59:22,856 --> 00:59:23,724
‐I'll see you tomorrow night.

1496
00:59:23,791 --> 00:59:26,095
‐Okay. Bye‐bye. [laughs]

1497
00:59:30,538 --> 00:59:33,611
‐Wow. Looks good.

1498
00:59:33,677 --> 00:59:36,617
‐Yeah, well, the show
is tomorrow night so‐‐

1499
00:59:36,683 --> 00:59:38,386
[Amber smacks lips]

1500
00:59:38,453 --> 00:59:39,856
‐Cool.
‐You know,

1501
00:59:39,923 --> 00:59:41,325
directing the
university Christmas Eve gala

1502
00:59:41,392 --> 00:59:44,198
is my favorite part of the year.

1503
00:59:44,265 --> 00:59:46,035
‐Yeah. It's exciting.

1504
00:59:46,102 --> 00:59:51,847
‐Would you maybe.
wanna be my date?

1505
00:59:51,914 --> 00:59:53,116
I know it's Christmas Eve,

1506
00:59:53,183 --> 00:59:54,719
and you probably
have family to see.

1507
00:59:54,786 --> 00:59:56,857
‐Oh, no. Um, nope.

1508
00:59:56,924 --> 01:00:02,267
Uh, I mean.
[sighs] just me.

1509
01:00:02,334 --> 01:00:04,706
So, yeah.

1510
01:00:04,773 --> 01:00:08,179
Yeah. Yeah, I would love
to come tomorrow night.

1511
01:00:08,246 --> 01:00:10,183
‐Okay. Great.

1512
01:00:17,999 --> 01:00:21,673
‐I'm‐‐ I'm so sorry. [sighs]

1513
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:24,111
But I‐I‐I just remembered
that I‐I've got,

1514
01:00:24,178 --> 01:00:27,084
um, I've got this thing
that I gotta go.

1515
01:00:27,151 --> 01:00:28,186
‐Okay.

1516
01:00:28,253 --> 01:00:29,255
‐There's something
I have to do.

1517
01:00:29,321 --> 01:00:31,359
‐Uh, okay.

1518
01:00:31,425 --> 01:00:33,664
‐Uh‐‐ sorry, but, but,
um, tomorrow night.

1519
01:00:33,731 --> 01:00:35,433
Big show, I'm there.

1520
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:36,737
Or here.

1521
01:00:36,803 --> 01:00:38,206
‐Is it.
is it something I said?

1522
01:00:38,273 --> 01:00:39,676
‐No, no, no!

1523
01:00:39,743 --> 01:00:41,145
Nothing you said or did
or anything at all.

1524
01:00:41,212 --> 01:00:42,414
You're amazing. I just.
I‐I gotta go do a thing.

1525
01:00:42,481 --> 01:00:44,151
But I'll see you tomorrow night.

1526
01:00:45,988 --> 01:00:47,759
‐[door slams]
‐[Charlie] Ruby!

1527
01:00:47,826 --> 01:00:50,263
Ruby! Hey!

1528
01:00:50,330 --> 01:00:52,635
Ruby! We need to talk.
‐[magical chimes]

1529
01:00:52,702 --> 01:00:54,071
‐What was that?

1530
01:00:54,138 --> 01:00:55,741
‐Did you just run away from her?
‐No, no. I just‐‐

1531
01:00:55,808 --> 01:00:57,077
‐That was not very gentlemanly.
‐I know. I'm sorry.

1532
01:00:57,144 --> 01:00:59,181
‐I thought you liked her!
‐I like you!

1533
01:01:01,485 --> 01:01:02,387
‐You do?

1534
01:01:04,726 --> 01:01:05,828
‐Afraid so.

1535
01:01:07,832 --> 01:01:09,268
‐But you're not
supposed to like me!

1536
01:01:09,335 --> 01:01:11,005
This was not a part

1537
01:01:11,072 --> 01:01:12,274
of the plan, Charlie.
‐No, I know. I know.

1538
01:01:12,341 --> 01:01:13,944
I‐I didn't mean to do it.

1539
01:01:14,011 --> 01:01:14,980
But‐‐ but when
I'm at dinner with her,

1540
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:16,148
I'm thinking about you.

1541
01:01:18,286 --> 01:01:20,257
Coffee, you. I‐I
go to kiss her goodnight

1542
01:01:20,323 --> 01:01:22,027
and all I can think about
is kissing you.

1543
01:01:29,509 --> 01:01:31,412
‐This is bad.

1544
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:33,884
‐Uh. that's not the response
I was hoping for.

1545
01:01:33,951 --> 01:01:37,257
‐[sighs] Um. This can't happen.

1546
01:01:37,324 --> 01:01:39,563
If‐‐ if I've done anything
to make you think that I‐‐

1547
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:41,232
‐No. Uh, no.

1548
01:01:41,299 --> 01:01:46,175

‐Wow. Great! Aren't these
dancing people great?

1723
01:09:27,998 --> 01:09:32,007
[sighing] Okay. You‐you‐‐
you just keep dancing.

1724
01:09:32,073 --> 01:09:34,011

‐Oh, hey. 'Sup?

1747
01:10:44,451 --> 01:10:45,888
‐Don't play innocent with me.

1748
01:10:45,954 --> 01:10:47,591
You promised no magic,
and you're in there

1749
01:10:47,658 --> 01:10:49,161
shooting off your
little love arrows,

1750
01:10:49,227 --> 01:10:51,131
making everybody crazy!

1751
01:10:51,198 --> 01:10:52,100
‐You don't know that.

1752
01:10:52,167 --> 01:10:53,369
‐I do know that.

1753
01:10:53,436 --> 01:10:55,006
But I don't understand why!

1754
01:10:56,208 --> 01:10:58,412
I did everything
that you me asked to do.

1755
01:10:58,479 --> 01:10:59,816
I put myself out there,

1756
01:10:59,882 --> 01:11:00,818
met somebody nice.

1757
01:11:00,884 --> 01:11:06,028
‐I'm sorry! I.
I was jealous.

1758
01:11:06,094 --> 01:11:07,497
‐What?

1759
01:11:08,633 --> 01:11:12,875
‐You were right.
What you said earlier.

1760
01:11:14,377 --> 01:11:16,315
There is something between us.

1761
01:11:16,381 --> 01:11:23,262
Um, I‐I think maybe
I‐I might have possibly

1762
01:11:23,329 --> 01:11:26,669
developed some feelings for you.

1763
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:29,441
‐You like me?

1764
01:11:30,744 --> 01:11:32,180
‐Yeah.

1765
01:11:32,247 --> 01:11:33,249
‐But you completely
shut me down.

1766
01:11:33,315 --> 01:11:34,417
‐I know! I.

1767
01:11:34,484 --> 01:11:35,721
‐You said
we couldn't be together.

1768
01:11:35,787 --> 01:11:37,023
‐We can't.

[sighs]

1770
01:11:50,517 --> 01:11:51,953
‐How am I supposed to take this?

1771
01:11:54,124 --> 01:11:55,561
I tell you that I like you,

1772
01:11:55,627 --> 01:11:59,669
and then you reject me.
You sabotage my date,

1773
01:11:59,735 --> 01:12:01,271
and then you tell me,
"Oh, no, just kidding,

1774
01:12:01,338 --> 01:12:02,975
I actually do like you,
but no, no, no, never mind,

1775
01:12:03,042 --> 01:12:04,812
we don't have
a future together."

1776
01:12:07,350 --> 01:12:08,720
What do you want from me?

1777
01:12:10,223 --> 01:12:15,934
‐I just.
I want you to be happy.

1778
01:12:16,001 --> 01:12:17,103
‐I can't be happy.

1779
01:12:19,509 --> 01:12:20,677
Can't you see that?

1780
01:12:24,284 --> 01:12:25,954
Same thing over and over again.

1781
01:12:27,357 --> 01:12:29,829
Somethin' always goes wrong.

1782
01:12:33,870 --> 01:12:36,843
Somehow I thought you and I
might be different.

1783
01:12:38,747 --> 01:12:39,849
but.

1784
01:12:42,453 --> 01:12:44,391
nothing ever changes.

1785
01:12:44,457 --> 01:12:47,497

1787
01:13:26,743 --> 01:13:29,114
‐Ruby, Ruby, Ruby,
ya did it.

1788
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:30,383
Look at you.

1789
01:13:30,449 --> 01:13:32,086
You get to move up
to the big chair.

1790
01:13:32,153 --> 01:13:33,690
I get my Christmas.

1791
01:13:33,757 --> 01:13:35,661
Everybody's a winner.

1792
01:13:35,727 --> 01:13:37,163
Couldn't have been easy.

1793
01:13:37,230 --> 01:13:38,600
‐It wasn't.

1794
01:13:38,667 --> 01:13:41,739
Um. It‐‐ it isn't.

1795
01:13:41,806 --> 01:13:43,743
‐Congratulations, Ruby.

1796
01:13:47,985 --> 01:13:49,622
‐Hey, kid,
what's the matter?

1797
01:13:52,226 --> 01:13:55,466
‐I. can't.

1798
01:13:58,205 --> 01:14:01,144
I. I can't take this job.

1799
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:03,516
Not like this.

1800
01:14:03,583 --> 01:14:06,021
‐What do you mean?

1801
01:14:06,088 --> 01:14:08,793
‐What I did was wrong.

1802
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:11,064
They're not right
for each other.

1803
01:14:11,131 --> 01:14:12,601
And he deserves
his perfect person.

1804
01:14:12,668 --> 01:14:14,905
They both do.

1805
01:14:14,972 --> 01:14:17,210
You were right.
You were right.

1806
01:14:17,276 --> 01:14:18,546
What you said in
the beginning:

1807
01:14:18,613 --> 01:14:20,984
I‐I don't have
the stomach for this.

1808
01:14:21,051 --> 01:14:23,222
shoving people together
just so they're not alone.

1809
01:14:23,288 --> 01:14:26,094
It's. it's why people
have stopped looking

1810
01:14:26,161 --> 01:14:27,531
for their person. They.

1811
01:14:27,598 --> 01:14:29,200
they don't believe in love.

1812
01:14:32,006 --> 01:14:34,477
I just can't be a part of that.

1813
01:14:37,016 --> 01:14:38,887
‐You know what this means,
don't you?

1814
01:14:41,425 --> 01:14:43,495
‐I lose my job.

1815
01:14:45,934 --> 01:14:47,103
‐Wait.

01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:51,244
[groans]

1817
01:14:51,311 --> 01:14:53,215
Ruby's right.

1818
01:14:53,282 --> 01:14:54,317
‐I'm sorry?

1819
01:14:54,384 --> 01:14:56,488
‐They're not a good match.

1820
01:14:56,556 --> 01:14:57,591
Why are we
putting people together

1821
01:14:57,658 --> 01:14:59,628
that don't belong together?

1822
01:14:59,695 --> 01:15:00,964
‐It's how it's done.

1823
01:15:01,031 --> 01:15:02,868
‐Maybe this job
should be more than

1824
01:15:02,935 --> 01:15:05,406
random arrows flying around
and us just hitting our numbers.

1825
01:15:05,473 --> 01:15:07,343
And. if you

1826
01:15:07,410 --> 01:15:08,479
don't believe that,

1827
01:15:08,546 --> 01:15:10,584
then maybe you should retire.

1828
01:15:10,650 --> 01:15:13,022
Just get on your stupid boat
and sail away.

1829
01:15:13,088 --> 01:15:14,859
Look, I don't know
who should be in charge,

1830
01:15:14,925 --> 01:15:17,163
but if you've given up on love,
it shouldn't be you.

1831
01:15:21,839 --> 01:15:24,277
Those were a lot of words
that I just said.

1832
01:15:25,914 --> 01:15:27,851
‐Since when did you become
so romantic?

1833
01:15:29,487 --> 01:15:31,959
‐Ugh! It's a new development.

1834
01:15:33,997 --> 01:15:36,501
‐This discussion isn't over.

1835
01:15:36,569 --> 01:15:38,640
And you‐‐

1836
01:15:38,707 --> 01:15:40,510
‐What's going
to happen to me now?

1837
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:43,282
‐It ain't pretty.

1838
01:15:45,419 --> 01:15:48,660
I have to take away your powers.

1839
01:15:48,727 --> 01:15:50,396
‐Does it hurt?

1840
01:15:50,463 --> 01:15:52,033
‐It hurts later.

1841
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:53,803
By the power vested in me
as the God of Love,

1842
01:15:53,870 --> 01:15:56,208
I hereby rescind
all your magical powers.

1843
01:16:01,786 --> 01:16:03,021
‐Is that it?

1844
01:16:03,088 --> 01:16:06,194
‐Yeah. Magic's weird.
‐Hmm.

1845
01:16:06,261 --> 01:16:07,564
‐Now for the hard part.

1846
01:16:10,937 --> 01:16:12,775
You have to be mortal.

1847
01:16:12,841 --> 01:16:15,212
‐Wait, you mean.
‐Of course.

1848
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:18,018
What do you think happens
when you get fired from a job

1849
01:16:18,085 --> 01:16:20,690
as a deity? Now.

1850
01:16:20,757 --> 01:16:23,897
you gotta pay taxes,
you develop joint pains,

1851
01:16:23,963 --> 01:16:27,136
you gotta face the unknown.
It's horrible.

1852
01:16:27,203 --> 01:16:28,506
Philomena.

1853
01:16:28,573 --> 01:16:31,712
please escort this human
back to Earth.

1854
01:16:31,779 --> 01:16:35,019
We will discuss
your little outburst later.

1855
01:16:35,085 --> 01:16:37,023
‐Yes, sir.

1856
01:16:39,795 --> 01:16:41,064
‐Oh, Ruby.

1857
01:16:42,634 --> 01:16:43,937
One more thing.

1858
01:16:47,276 --> 01:16:48,312
I'm proud of you.

1859
01:16:49,481 --> 01:16:51,184
‐You are?
‐Yeah.

1860
01:16:51,251 --> 01:16:52,688
It takes a lot of courage
to stand up

1861
01:16:52,754 --> 01:16:54,224
for what you believe in.

1862
01:16:54,290 --> 01:16:56,194
You're gonna do
just fine on Earth.

1863
01:16:58,533 --> 01:16:59,835
I gotta admit.

1864
01:16:59,902 --> 01:17:02,875
I'll miss your
annoying chipperness.

1865
01:17:02,941 --> 01:17:04,512
‐You think I'm annoying?

1866
01:17:04,578 --> 01:17:05,479
‐That's not the point.

1867
01:17:05,547 --> 01:17:07,784
Point is, you done good.

1868
01:17:07,851 --> 01:17:09,287
You helped a lot of people
find love,

1869
01:17:09,354 --> 01:17:11,491
and now I think
it's time for you,

1870
01:17:11,559 --> 01:17:13,696
find a little love for yourself.

1871
01:17:15,399 --> 01:17:19,073
Well, enough of that.

1872
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:20,376
Scram.

1873
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:23,382
[magical tinkle]

1874
01:17:25,352 --> 01:17:30,931
‐So. How's it feel,
being mortal?

1875
01:17:30,997 --> 01:17:32,868
‐Pretty much the same, I guess.

1876
01:17:32,935 --> 01:17:34,972
‐That's kind of a letdown.

1877
01:17:35,039 --> 01:17:38,580
‐Hey. Did you stick up
for me back there?

1878
01:17:38,646 --> 01:17:41,819
‐Oh. I mean. I guess.

1879
01:17:41,886 --> 01:17:44,023
‐That was really cool of you.

1880
01:17:44,090 --> 01:17:46,328
‐Yeah. It was really cool of me,
wasn't it?

1881
01:17:46,394 --> 01:17:47,430
‐I think we're friends now.

1882
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:48,600
‐Okay. I'm drawing the line.

1883
01:17:48,666 --> 01:17:49,969
There's a reason
that we are here.

1884
01:17:50,035 --> 01:17:50,937
‐Okay.

1885
01:17:57,049 --> 01:17:58,553
Amber?

1886
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:00,557
Hi, I'm‐‐ I'm Ruby,

1887
01:18:00,624 --> 01:18:01,859
one of Charlie's friends.

1888
01:18:01,926 --> 01:18:04,832
‐Oh. You're the one.

1889
01:18:04,899 --> 01:18:06,268
‐The one what?

1890
01:18:06,334 --> 01:18:08,138
‐Charlie and I
broke up last night.

1891
01:18:08,205 --> 01:18:10,610
He said he was in love
with someone else.

1892
01:18:10,677 --> 01:18:13,382
You.

1893
01:18:13,448 --> 01:18:15,352
‐I'm so sorry.
‐Hey.

1894
01:18:15,419 --> 01:18:17,256
The last thing I want
is a man who is in love

1895
01:18:17,323 --> 01:18:18,860
with someone else.

1896
01:18:18,927 --> 01:18:20,462
You should go for him.
