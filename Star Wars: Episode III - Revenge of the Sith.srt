1
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:08,940
Lock on to him, R2.

2
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:12,480
Master, General Grievous's ship is directly ahead...

3
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,820
the one crawling with vulture droids.

4
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,440
I see it. Oh, this is going to be easy.

5
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,660
- Oddball, do you copy? - Copy, Red Leader.

6
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,040
Mark my position. Form your squad up behind me.

7
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,050
We're on your tail, General Kenobi.

8
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,080
Set S-foils in attack position.

9
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,020
This is where the fun begins.

10
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,140
Let them pass between us.

11
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,040
They're all over me.

12
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:14,170
- Get them off my... - I'm gonna go help them out.

13
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,670
No. They are doing their job so we can do ours.

14
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,560
Missiles. Pull up.

15
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,200
- They overshot us. - They're coming around.

16
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:48,030
All right, R4. No, no. Nothing too fancy.

17
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,380
Surge all power units, R2. Stand by reverse thrusters.

18
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,230
We got 'em, R2.

19
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,730
Flying is for droids.

20
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,500
- I'm hit. Anakin?   - I see them.

21
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,740
Buzz droids.

22
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,390
R4, be careful. You have a...

23
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,430
Oh, dear.

24
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,400
They're shutting down all the controls.

25
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,650
Move to the right so I can get a clear shot at them.

26
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,930
The mission. Get to the command ship.

27
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,480
Get the chancellor. I'm running out of tricks here.

28
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,660
In the name of...

29
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,950
- Hold your fire! You're not helping. - I agree. Bad idea.

30
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,140
I can't see a thing. My cockpit's fogging.

31
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,310
They're all over me. Anakin!

32
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,020
- Move to the right. - Hold on. You'll get us both killed.

33
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,480
Get out of here. There's nothing more you can do.

34
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,770
I'm not leaving without you, Master.

35
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,620
Get him, R2.

36
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,050
Watch out.

37
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,000
R2, hit the buzz droid's centre eye.

38
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,520
- Yeah, you got him! - Great, R2.

39
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,730
The general's command ship is dead ahead.

40
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,900
Have you noticed the shields are still up?

41
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,410
Sorry, Master.

42
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,660
I have a bad feeling about this.

43
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,390
There they are. Get them.

44
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,200
R2, locate the chancellor.

45
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,250
The chancellor's signal is coming from right there...

46
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,420
the observation platform at the top of that spire.

47
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,460
I sense Count Dooku.

48
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:16,210
- I sense a trap. - Next move?

49
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,880
Spring the trap.

50
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,810
R2, go back. I need you to stay with the ship.

51
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,810
Here. Take this and wait for orders.

52
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,610
What's the situation, Captain?

53
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,660
Two Jedi have landed in the main hangar bay. We're tracking them.

54
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:51,080
Just as Count Dooku predicted.

55
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,290
Destroyers.

56
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,360
Drop your weapons. I said drop 'em.

57
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,360
- Roger. - Roger, roger.

58
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,820
Those are Jedi fighters all right.

59
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,410
- Did you press the stop button? - No. Did you?

60
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,830
There's more than one way out of here.

61
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,800
We don't want to get out. We want to get moving.

62
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:37,760
R2, activate elevator 31174.

63
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,800
- Come in, R2. - What that?

64
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,810
R2, do you copy?

65
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:46,350
R2, activate the elevator number 31174.

66
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:50,190
Get back to work. That nothin'.

67
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,240
Activate the elevator 31174.

68
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,820
R2...

69
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,950
Always on the move.

70
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,040
R2, switch on the comlink. R2, can you hear me?

71
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,750
R2?

72
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,710
R2! R2!

73
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:20,060
Stop. Stop. R2, we need to be going up.

74
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,390
Hands up,Jedi.

75
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,680
R2, do you copy?

76
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:30,760
R2, do you hear me? R2, we need to be going up, not down.

77
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,900
Hey, you!

78
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,740
That's better.

79
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,410
You stupid little astro droid.

80
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,220
Oh, it's you.

81
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,140
My eyes! My eyes!

82
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:07,600
- What was that all about? - R2 has been...

83
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,720
- No loose wire jokes. - Did I say anything?

84
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,770
- He's trying. - I didn't say anything.

85
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,320
- Chancellor. - Are you all right?

86
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,900
Count Dooku.

87
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,490
- This time we will do it together. - I was about to say that.

88
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,670
Get help. You're no match for him. He's a Sith lord.

89
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:17,840
Chancellor Palpatine, Sith lords are our speciality.

90
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,810
Your swords, please.

91
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:24,380
We don't want to make a mess of things in front of the chancellor.

92
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,730
You won't get away this time, Dooku.

93
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,650
I've been looking forward to this.

94
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:42,950
My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count.

95
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,530
Good. Twice the pride, double the fall.

96
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:07,600
Get...

97
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,930
I sense great fear in you, Skywalker.

98
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,010
You have hate. You have anger.

99
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:43,720
But you don't use them.

100
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,780
Good, Anakin. Good.

101
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,250
Kill him.

102
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,300
Kill him now.

103
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,850
I shouldn't.

104
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:23,810
Do it.

105
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,780
You did well, Anakin.

106
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,070
He was too dangerous to be kept alive.

107
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,290
Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.

108
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,290
I shouldn't have done that. It's not the Jedi way.

109
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:53,510
It is only natural. He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge.

110
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,760
It wasn't the first time, Anakin.

111
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,510
Remember what you told me about your mother and the Sand People?

112
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:06,890
Now we must leave before more security droids arrive.

113
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,270
Anakin, there's no time.

114
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,730
We must get off this ship before it's too late.

115
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:21,740
- He seems to be all right. - Leave him, or we'll never make it.

116
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,910
His fate will be the same as ours.

117
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,160
Prepare for attack!

118
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,380
All batteries, fire! Fire!

119
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,350
Elevator's not working.

120
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:53,730
R2, activate elevator 3224.

121
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:15,720
- Reverse stabilizers. - Reversing stabilizers.

122
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,110
Magnetize! Magnetize!

123
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,990
Fire the emergency booster engines.

124
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,920
We're levelling out, sir.

125
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,850
Easy. We're in a bit of a situation here.

126
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,560
- Did I miss something? - Hold on.

127
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,860
- What is that? - Oops.

128
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,950
R2. R2, shut down the elevator.

129
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,280
Too late. Jump!

130
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,250
Let's see if we can find something in the hangar bay that's still flyable.

131
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,470
R2, get down here.

132
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,850
R2, do you copy?

133
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,560
General, we found the Jedi. They're in hallway 328.

134
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,020
Activate ray shields.

135
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,270
Ray shields.

136
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,280
Wait a minute. How did this happen? We're smarter than this.

137
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,740
Apparently not.

138
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,920
- I say patience. - Patience?

139
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,290
Yes. R2 will be along in a few moments...

140
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,130
and then he'll release the ray shields.

141
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,550
See? No problem.

142
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,470
Don't move.

143
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,730
Do you have a plan B?

144
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,740
Ah, yes.

145
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,950
The negotiator.

146
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,290
General Kenobi. We've been waiting for you.

147
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,580
Excuse me.

148
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:53,410
- That wasn't much of a rescue. - You're welcome.

149
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,680
And...

150
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,840
Anakin Skywalker.

151
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:04,680
I was expecting someone with your reputation to be a little... older.

152
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:11,100
General Grievous. You're shorter than I expected.

153
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,020
Jedi scum.

154
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,610
We have a job to do, Anakin. Try not to upset him.

155
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:28,040
Your lightsabres will make a fine addition to my collection.

156
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:31,840
Not this time. And this time, you won't escape.

157
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:32,960
R2 R2.

158
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,350
Crush them!

159
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:42,810
Make them suffer!

160
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,520
Come. Now!

161
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,810
Stay at your stations!

162
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,370
Get him! Get him!

163
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,220
Run!

164
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:25,690
Don't bother with them.

165
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:28,100
- Keep the ship in orbit. - Yes, sir.

166
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,040
You lose, General Kenobi.

167
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,940
Get out of here! Run!

168
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,580
Time to abandon ship.

169
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,210
All the escape pods have been launched.

170
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,380
Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this?

171
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:38,220
- You mean, can I land what's left of it? - Well?

172
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,200
Under the circumstances,

173
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:42,180
I'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant.

174
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,470
Strap yourselves in.

175
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:48,110
Open all hatches. Extend all flaps and drag fins.

176
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:07,000
We lost something.

177
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:09,580
Not to worry. We are still flying half a ship.

178
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,840
Now we're really picking up speed.

179
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,310
Eight plus 60.

180
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:30,720
- We're in the atmosphere. - Grab that. Keep us level.

181
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,280
Steady.

182
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:50,460
Easy, R2.

183
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,300
5000 5000.

184
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:57,340
Fire ships on the left and the right.

185
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:00,180
- We'll take you in. - Copy that.

186
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,350
- Landing strip, straight ahead. - We're coming in too hot.

187
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,800
Another happy landing.

188
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:11,080
Coming, Master?

189
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:13,880
No. I'm not brave enough for politics.

190
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,630
I have to report to the council.

191
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,170
Besides, someone needs to be the poster boy.

192
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:22,140
Hold on. This whole operation was your idea.

193
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:25,390
Let us not forget, Anakin, that you rescued me from the buzz droids.

194
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,890
And you killed Count Dooku, and you rescued the chancellor...

195
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,930
carrying me unconscious on your back.

196
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:32,520
All because of your training.

197
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:36,150
Anakin, let's be fair. Today you were the hero...

198
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,650
and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians.

199
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:43,490
All right. But you owe me one, and not for saving your skin for the 1Oth time.

200
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,900
Ninth time.

201
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:49,840
That business on Cato Neimoidia doesn't count. I'll see you at the briefing.

202
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,710
Chancellor Palpatine, are you all right?

203
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:00,720
Yes. Thanks to your two Jedi knights.

204
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:05,510
They killed Count Dooku, but General Grievous has escaped once again.

205
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:09,150
General Grievous will run and hide, as he always does. He's a coward.

206
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:13,570
But with Count Dooku dead, he is the leader of the droid army.

207
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,570
And I assure you...

208
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,000
the senate will vote to continue the war

209
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,400
as long as Grievous is alive.

210
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:23,580
Then the Jedi Council will make finding Grievous our highest priority.

211
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,960
- Watch it. - Excuse me.

212
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:30,040
- Come along, R2. - The Republic cannot praise you enough.

213
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:32,300
Thank you, Senator Organa.

214
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,960
It couldn't possibly be as bad as all that.

215
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,590
Now there I agree with you.

216
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,430
In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself.

217
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:45,770
But the fighting will continue until General Grievous is spare parts.

218
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:49,310
I will do everything I can in the senate.

219
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,140
- Excuse me. - Certainly.

220
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,740
Anakin!

221
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:08,960
I've missed you, Padme.

222
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:13,380
There were whispers that you'd been killed.

223
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,380
I'm all right.

224
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,130
It feels like we've been apart for a lifetime.

225
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:22,050
And it might have been, if the chancellor hadn't been kidnapped.

226
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:25,520
I don't think they would have ever brought us back from the outer rim sieges.

227
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,270
- Wait. Not here. - Yes, here.

228
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,600
I'm tired of all this deception.

229
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,850
I don't care if they know we're married.

230
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,230
Anakin, don't say things like that.

231
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,660
Are you all right? You're trembling.

232
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,920
What's going on?

233
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:53,160
Something wonderful has happened.

234
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:58,430
Ani, I'm pregnant.

235
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,900
That's wonderful.

236
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,780
What are we gonna do?

237
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,660
We're not gonna worry about anything right now. All right?

238
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,250
This is a happy moment.

239
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,540
The happiest moment of my life.

240
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:37,530
Yes, Lord Sidious?

241
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,530
General Grievous...

242
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:44,740
I suggest you move the separatist leaders to Mustafar.

243
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,910
It will be done, my lord.

244
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:53,080
The end of the war is near, General.

245
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,800
But the loss of Count Dooku...

246
00:28:56,930 --> 00:29:01,060
His death was a necessary loss.

247
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:05,470
Soon I will have a new apprentice...

248
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:10,850
one far younger and more powerful.

249
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:40,890
Ani, I want to have our baby back home on Naboo.

250
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:44,350
We can go to the lake country where no one will know...

251
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,350
where we can be safe.

252
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:49,900
I can go early and fix up the baby's room.

253
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:57,910
I know the perfect spot. Right by the gardens.

254
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,780
You are so... beautiful.

255
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,460
It's only because I'm so in love.

256
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,520
No.

257
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:14,210
No, it's because I'm so in love with you.

258
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,260
So love has blinded you?

259
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,760
That's not exactly what I meant.

260
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,390
But it's probably true.

261
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:38,110
Anakin, help me!

262
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,680
What's bothering you?

263
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,100
Nothing.

264
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,400
I remember when I gave this to you.

265
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,690
How long is it gonna take for us to be honest with each other?

266
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:01,740
- It was a dream. - Bad?

267
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:06,950
Like the ones I used to have about my mother, just before she died.

268
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:08,370
And?

269
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,750
And it was about you.

270
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,630
Tell me.

271
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,930
It was only a dream.

272
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,820
You die in childbirth.

273
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,740
And the baby?

274
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,160
I don't know.

275
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:47,870
- It was only a dream. - I won't let this one become real.

276
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,630
This baby will change our lives.

277
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:55,550
I doubt the queen will continue to allow me to serve in the senate.

278
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,050
If the council discovers you're the father, you'll be expelled...

279
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,090
I know. I know.

280
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,480
Do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us?

281
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,520
We don't need his help.

282
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,860
Our baby is a blessing.

283
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,550
Premonitions?

284
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,130
Premonitions.

285
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,470
These visions you have...

286
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:40,180
They're of pain, suffering.

287
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,020
Death.

288
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:48,520
Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?

289
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:52,030
Someone.

290
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,030
Close to you?

291
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,700
Yes.

292
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:01,410
Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin.

293
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:05,830
The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.

294
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:10,580
I won't let these visions come true, Master Yoda.

295
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:14,630
Death is a natural part of life.

296
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,420
Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force.

297
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,810
Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not.

298
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:26,020
Attachment leads to jealousy.

299
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:29,560
The shadow of greed that is.

300
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,900
What must I do, Master Yoda?

301
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:35,650
Train yourself to let go...

302
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:39,200
of everything you fear to lose.

303
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,460
You've missed the report on the outer rim sieges.

304
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,170
I'm sorry. I was held up.

305
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:00,170
- I have no excuse. - In short, they are going very well.

306
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:05,470
Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity.

307
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:07,480
What's wrong, then?

308
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:13,780
The senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the chancellor today.

309
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:18,230
That can only mean less deliberating and more action. Is that bad?

310
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:20,780
It'll make it easier for us to end this war.

311
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,830
Be careful of your friend Palpatine.

312
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,380
Be careful of what?

313
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,130
- He has requested your presence. - What for?

314
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,420
He would not say.

315
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:37,090
He didn't inform the council? That's unusual, isn't it?

316
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,430
All of this is unusual.

317
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,880
And it's making me feel uneasy.

318
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:58,870
I hope you trust me, Anakin.

319
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,110
Of course.

320
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:04,160
I need your help, son.

321
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,330
What do you mean?

322
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:10,000
I'm depending on you.

323
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,620
For what? I don't understand.

324
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:18,350
To be the eyes, ears and voice of the Republic.

325
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:20,080
Anakin...

326
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,810
I'm appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council.

327
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,270
Me?

328
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,440
A master?

329
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,690
I'm overwhelmed, sir.

330
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:36,700
But the council elects its own members. They'll never accept this.

331
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:40,320
I think they will. They need you.

332
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:43,120
More than you know.

333
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:58,300
Allow this appointment lightly the council does not.

334
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:01,850
Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.

335
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,600
I understand.

336
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:07,050
You are on this council...

337
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:09,760
but we do not grant you the rank of master.

338
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:11,890
What?

339
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:20,360
How can you do this? This is outrageous.

340
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,040
It's unfair.

341
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,240
How can you be on the council and not be a master?

342
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:30,880
Take a seat, young Skywalker.

343
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:35,590
Forgive me, Master.

344
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:42,220
We have surveyed all systems in the Republic...

345
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:46,050
but have found no sign of General Grievous.

346
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:48,940
Hiding in the outer rim Grievous is.

347
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:52,150
The outlying systems you must sweep.

348
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,490
We do not have many ships to spare.

349
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:56,770
What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?

350
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:00,570
It is critical we send an attack group there immediately.

351
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:04,120
He's right. It's a system we cannot afford to lose.

352
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,540
Go I will.

353
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:10,670
Good relations with the Wookiees I have.

354
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,380
It's settled then.

355
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:15,010
Yoda will take a battalion of clones

356
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:17,500
to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk.

357
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,680
May the Force be with us all.

358
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:24,560
What kind of nonsense is this?

359
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:27,060
Put me on the council and not make me a master?

360
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:29,940
It's never been done in the history of the Jedi. It's insulting.

361
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:32,900
Calm down, Anakin. You have been given a great honour.

362
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:35,980
To be on the council at your age... it's never happened before.

363
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:40,530
The fact of the matter is you are too close to the chancellor.

364
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:44,410
The council doesn't like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs.

365
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,910
I swear to you, I didn't ask to be put on the council.

366
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:50,250
But it's what you wanted.

367
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:53,670
Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off.

368
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,670
That has nothing to do with this.

369
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,720
The only reason the council has approved your appointment...

370
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:01,170
is because the chancellor trusts you.

371
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:03,180
And?

372
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:05,480
Anakin, I am on your side.

373
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,060
I didn't want to put you in this situation.

374
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,350
What situation?

375
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:16,770
The council wants you to report on all the chancellor's dealings.

376
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:19,230
They want to know what he's up to.

377
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:25,780
They want me to spy on the chancellor?

378
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:29,380
- But that's treason. - We are at war, Anakin.

379
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:34,340
Why didn't the council give me this assignment when we were in session?

380
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:36,880
This assignment is not to be on record.

381
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:40,930
The chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan.

382
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:44,060
He befriended me. He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here.

383
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:46,260
That is why you must help us.

384
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,850
Anakin, our allegiance is to the senate, not to its leader...

385
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:53,650
who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired.

386
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,740
The senate demanded that he stay longer.

387
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:59,030
Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin. Something is out of place.

388
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:03,330
You're asking me to do something against the Jedi code.

389
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:07,330
Against the Republic. Against a mentor and a friend.

390
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:11,410
That's what's out of place here. Why are you asking this of me?

391
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,630
The council is asking you.

392
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,550
Anakin did not take to his new assignment with much enthusiasm.

393
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,650
It's very dangerous, putting them together.

394
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:33,070
I don't think the boy can handle it.

395
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,110
I don't trust him.

396
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:39,030
With all due respect, Master, is he not the chosen one?

397
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:43,450
Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?

398
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,410
So the prophecy says.

399
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:51,420
A prophecy that misread could have been.

400
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,130
He will not let me down.

401
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,170
He never has.

402
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:00,310
I hope right you are.

403
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:28,210
Sometimes I wonder what's happening to the Jedi order.

404
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:32,170
I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.

405
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:37,220
Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?

406
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:39,220
What do you mean?

407
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:44,520
What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists...

408
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:48,230
and the Republic has become the very evil we've been fighting to destroy?

409
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:52,570
I don't believe that. And you're sounding like a separatist.

410
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:57,490
This war represents a failure to listen.

411
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,610
Now you're closer to the chancellor than anyone.

412
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:03,000
Please, ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.

413
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,660
Don't ask me to do that.

414
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:10,870
Make a motion in the senate, where that kind of a request belongs.

415
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,800
- What is it? - Nothing.

416
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:18,970
Don't do this. Don't shut me out. Let me help you.

417
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:23,230
Hold me.

418
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:25,590
Like you did by the lake on Naboo.

419
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:29,440
So long ago, when there was nothing but our love.

420
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:34,070
No politics, no plotting, no war.

421
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,990
- You wanted to see me, Chancellor. - Yes, Anakin.

422
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,070
Come closer. I have good news.

423
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:21,660
Our clone intelligence units...

424
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:24,830
have discovered the location of General Grievous.

425
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,530
He's hiding in the Utapau system.

426
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:28,830
At last.

427
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:33,420
We'll be able to capture that monster and end this war.

428
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:36,880
I would worry about the collective wisdom of the council...

429
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:39,380
if it didn't select you for this assignment.

430
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,850
You're the best choice, by far.

431
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:47,360
Sit down.

432
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,680
Leave us.

433
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:02,680
Anakin.

434
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:07,710
You know I'm not able to rely on the Jedi Council.

435
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:12,840
If they haven't included you in their plot, they soon will.

436
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,880
I'm not sure I understand.

437
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:19,680
You must sense what I have come to suspect.

438
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:23,180
The Jedi Council want control of the Republic.

439
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,470
They're planning to betray me.

440
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:29,560
- I don't think that... - Anakin.

441
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,690
Search your feelings.

442
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:37,440
You know, don't you?

443
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:43,750
I know they don't trust you.

444
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:47,160
Or the senate. Or the Republic.

445
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:49,870
Or democracy, for that matter.

446
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:55,000
I have to admit, my trust in them has been shaken.

447
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,590
Why?

448
00:44:58,810 --> 00:45:00,930
They asked you to do something that

449
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:03,050
made you feel dishonest, didn't they?

450
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:08,940
They asked you to spy on me, didn't they?

451
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:15,490
I don't...

452
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,990
I don't know what to say.

453
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,570
Remember back to your early teachings.

454
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:26,070
All who gain power are afraid to lose it.

455
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:30,840
- Even the Jedi. - The Jedi use their power for good.

456
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,090
Good is a point of view, Anakin.

457
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:38,380
The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way...

458
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:43,180
including their quest for greater power.

459
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:47,730
The Sith rely on their passion for their strength.

460
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:50,610
They think inwards... only about themselves.

461
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:54,060
And the Jedi don't?

462
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:58,730
The Jedi are selfless. They only care about others.

463
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:13,880
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise?

464
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
No.

465
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:23,060
I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you.

466
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,480
It's a Sith legend.

467
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,610
Darth Plagueis was a dark lord of the Sith...

468
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:34,610
so powerful and so wise...

469
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:39,570
he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians...

470
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:42,870
to create... life.

471
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:47,580
He had such a knowledge of the dark side...

472
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:52,170
he could even keep the ones he cared about...

473
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:54,760
from dying.

474
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:02,840
He could actually... save people from death?

475
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:08,220
The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities...

476
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:12,570
some consider to be unnatural.

477
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:15,530
What happened to him?

478
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:18,700
He became so powerful...

479
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,070
the only thing he was afraid of was...

480
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:25,160
losing his power.

481
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:27,420
Which eventually, of course, he did.

482
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:33,790
Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew.

483
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:37,220
Then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.

484
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:42,180
It's ironic.

485
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:44,430
He could save others from death...

486
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,640
but not himself.

487
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:54,360
Is it possible to learn this power?

488
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,320
Not from a Jedi.

489
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:19,100
All Red units, over here!

490
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:33,270
Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau?

491
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:35,990
A partial message was intercepted...

492
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:38,570
in a diplomatic packet from the chairman of Utapau.

493
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,240
Act on this we must.

494
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:48,080
The capture of General Grievous will end this war.

495
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:52,000
Quickly and decisively we should proceed.

496
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:57,140
The chancellor has requested... that I lead the campaign.

497
00:48:57,930 --> 00:49:00,550
The council will make up its own mind who is to go...

498
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,640
not the chancellor.

499
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:07,680
A master is needed, with more experience.

500
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:11,180
I concur. Master Kenobi should go.

501
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,810
I agree.

502
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:15,060
Aye.

503
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,740
Aye.

504
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,780
Very well. Council adjourned.

505
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:29,380
The droids have started up their main power generators.

506
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:34,960
- Then now the time is, Commander. - Yes, sir.

507
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:49,110
Charge!

508
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:06,160
Head for cover!

509
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,470
- You're gonna need me on this one. - I agree.

510
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,440
However, it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase.

511
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:28,680
Master.

512
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:32,200
I've disappointed you.

513
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:35,950
I haven't been very appreciative of your training.

514
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:39,820
I've been arrogant, and I apologize.

515
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,900
I've just been so frustrated with the council.

516
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:49,950
You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you.

517
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:52,660
I have trained you since you were a small boy.

518
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,880
I have taught you everything I know.

519
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:58,760
And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be.

520
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,550
But be patient, Anakin.

521
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:05,600
It will not be long before the council makes you a Jedi master.

522
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:16,240
Obi-Wan. May the Force be with you.

523
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:19,240
Goodbye, old friend. May the Force be with you.

524
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:44,120
Fortunately, most of the cities are

525
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,390
concentrated on this small continent here.

526
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,150
On the far side.

527
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:50,560
I'll keep them distracted until you get there.

528
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:52,400
Just don't take too long.

529
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,110
Come on. When have I ever let you down?

530
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:57,500
Very well. The burden is on me

531
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:00,660
not to destroy all the droids until you arrive.

532
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:27,850
Save your energy.

533
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:30,310
I can't.

534
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,190
Don't give up, Padm?

535
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:47,540
Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he?

536
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:50,290
He came by this morning.

537
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,590
What did he want?

538
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:55,630
He's worried about you.

539
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:00,380
He says you've been under a lot of stress.

540
00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:04,930
I feel lost.

541
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:09,230
Lost? What do you mean?

542
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:13,520
Obi-Wan and the council don't trust me.

543
00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:17,020
They trust you with their lives.

544
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:20,240
Something's happening.

545
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:23,570
I'm not the Jedi I should be.

546
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,870
I want more.

547
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:31,000
And I know I shouldn't.

548
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:35,090
You expect too much of yourself.

549
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:42,270
- I found a way to save you. - Save me?

550
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:44,300
From my nightmares.

551
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,350
Is that what's bothering you?

552
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,310
I won't lose you, Padm?

553
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:52,230
I'm not gonna die in childbirth, Ani.

554
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,770
- I promise you. - No, I promise you.

555
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:41,120
Greetings, young Jedi.

556
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:44,660
What brings you to our remote sanctuary?

557
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:46,700
Unfortunately, the war.

558
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:51,370
There's no war here... unless you brought it with you.

559
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:54,670
With your kind permission, I should like some fuel...

560
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,700
and to use your city as a base

561
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:59,710
as I search nearby systems for General Grievous.

562
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:11,980
He is here. We are being held hostage.

563
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:14,980
- They are watching us. - I understand.

564
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:19,910
Tenth level, thousands of battle droids.

565
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,440
Tell your people to take shelter.

566
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:25,540
If you have warriors, now is the time.

567
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:40,680
Take the fighter back to the ship. Tell Cody I've made contact.

568
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:46,720
- Is he bringing additional warriors? - He didn't say.

569
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:34,270
It won't be long before the armies of the Republic track us here.

570
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:42,120
I am sending you to the Mustafar system in the outer rim.

571
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:51,920
It is a volcanic planet.

572
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:55,330
- You will be safe there. - Safe?

573
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:59,430
Chancellor Palpatine managed to escape your grip, General.

574
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:03,970
Without Count Dooku, I have doubts about your ability to keep us safe.

575
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:10,020
Be thankful, Viceroy, you have not found yourself in my grip.

576
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:16,150
Your ship is waiting.

577
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:35,300
Hello there.

578
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:39,680
General Kenobi.

579
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,180
You are a bold one.

580
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:48,690
Kill him.

581
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:05,950
Back away.

582
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:10,660
I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.

583
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,260
Your move.

584
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:14,800
You fool.

585
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:20,720
I've been trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku.

586
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:29,730
Attack, Kenobi.

587
00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:48,390
Army or not...

588
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:53,600
you must realize you are doomed.

589
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:55,700
I don't think so.

590
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:55,880
Cover that corner.

591
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:03,970
Master Windu, may I interrupt?

592
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:06,860
General Kenobi has made contact with General Grievous...

593
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:09,220
and we have begun our attack.

594
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:11,070
Thank you, Commander.

595
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:15,270
Anakin, deliver this report to the chancellor.

596
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:17,650
His reaction will give us a clue to his intentions.

597
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:19,240
Yes, Master.

598
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:29,170
I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi.

599
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:32,540
The dark side of the Force surrounds the chancellor.

600
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:35,470
If he does not give up his emergency powers...

601
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:37,470
after the destruction of Grievous...

602
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,800
then he should be removed from office.

603
01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:43,800
The Jedi Council would have to take control of the senate...

604
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:45,810
in order to secure a peaceful transition.

605
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:50,400
To a dark place this line of thought will carry us.

606
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:55,360
Great care we must take.

607
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:03,660
Chancellor.

608
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:06,950
We've just received a report from Master Kenobi.

609
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:09,710
He has engaged General Grievous.

610
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:13,170
We can only hope that Master Kenobi is up to the challenge.

611
01:02:15,050 --> 01:02:17,010
I should be there with him.

612
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:19,460
It's upsetting to me to see that the council...

613
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,640
doesn't seem to fully appreciate your talents.

614
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:27,060
Don't you wonder why they won't make you a Jedi master?

615
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:30,730
I wish I knew.

616
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:34,560
More and more I get the feeling that...

617
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:36,900
I'm being excluded from the council.

618
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:47,830
I know there are things about the Force that they're not telling me.

619
01:02:50,090 --> 01:02:52,500
They don't trust you, Anakin.

620
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:55,250
They see your future.

621
01:02:55,390 --> 01:02:59,250
They know your power will be too strong to control.

622
01:03:00,430 --> 01:03:02,950
You must break through the fog of lies

623
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:05,470
the Jedi have created around you.

624
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:11,650
Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force.

625
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,530
How do you know the ways of the Force?

626
01:03:15,570 --> 01:03:18,610
My mentor taught me everything about the Force.

627
01:03:19,410 --> 01:03:22,370
Even the nature of the dark side.

628
01:03:24,370 --> 01:03:26,700
You know the dark side?

629
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:28,670
Anakin.

630
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:32,620
If one is to understand the great mystery...

631
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:35,130
one must study all its aspects...

632
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:38,380
not just the dogmatic narrow view of the Jedi.

633
01:03:39,140 --> 01:03:42,260
If you wish to become a complete and wise leader...

634
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:46,060
you must embrace a larger view of the Force.

635
01:03:46,810 --> 01:03:48,810
Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin.

636
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:55,020
Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi.

637
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:58,400
Learn to know the dark side of the Force...

638
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:02,150
and you will be able to save your wife...

639
01:04:02,290 --> 01:04:04,330
from certain death.

640
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:07,330
What did you say?

641
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:11,080
Use my knowledge. I beg you.

642
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,960
You're the Sith lord.

643
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:18,930
I know what's been troubling you. Listen to me.

644
01:04:19,930 --> 01:04:23,600
Don't continue to be a pawn of the Jedi Council.

645
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:29,190
Ever since I've known you, you've been searching for a life...

646
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:31,860
greater than that of an ordinary Jedi.

647
01:04:31,990 --> 01:04:34,360
A life of significance...

648
01:04:34,490 --> 01:04:35,950
of conscience.

649
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:45,240
- Are you going to kill me? - I would certainly like to.

650
01:04:46,330 --> 01:04:48,710
I know you would.

651
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:52,620
I can feel your anger.

652
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:55,430
It gives you focus...

653
01:04:55,550 --> 01:04:57,880
makes you stronger.

654
01:05:04,190 --> 01:05:06,510
I'm going to turn you over to the Jedi Council.

655
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:08,270
Of course. You should.

656
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,400
But you're not sure of their intentions, are you?

657
01:05:11,530 --> 01:05:14,020
I will quickly discover the truth of all this.

658
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,570
You have great wisdom, Anakin.

659
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:21,320
Know the power of the dark side.

660
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:24,210
Power to save Padm?

661
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:33,920
So uncivilized.

662
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:43,430
Master Windu, I must talk to you.

663
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,450
Skywalker, we just received word that

664
01:07:45,450 --> 01:07:47,350
Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous.

665
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,360
We're on our way to make sure...

666
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:51,730
the chancellor returns emergency power back to the senate.

667
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:55,480
He won't give up his power. I've just learned a terrible truth.

668
01:07:55,620 --> 01:07:57,740
I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith lord.

669
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,740
A Sith lord?

670
01:08:00,870 --> 01:08:03,710
Yes. The one we've been looking for.

671
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:06,830
- How do you know this? - He knows the ways of the Force.

672
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:10,000
He's been trained to use the dark side.

673
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:12,920
- Are you sure? - Absolutely.

674
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:16,590
Then our worst fears have been realized.

675
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:20,170
We must move quickly if the Jedi order is to survive.

676
01:08:20,310 --> 01:08:22,720
Master, the chancellor is very powerful.

677
01:08:22,850 --> 01:08:25,090
You'll need my help if you're going to arrest him.

678
01:08:25,230 --> 01:08:28,150
For you own good, stay out of this affair.

679
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:31,030
I sense a great deal of confusion in you, young Skywalker.

680
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:33,280
There is much fear that clouds your judgement.

681
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:35,360
- I must go, Master. - No.

682
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:41,530
If what you've told me is true, you will have gained my trust.

683
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:44,200
But for now, remain here.

684
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:48,200
Wait in the council chambers until we return.

685
01:08:50,510 --> 01:08:51,750
Yes, Master.

686
01:09:21,870 --> 01:09:24,110
You do know, don't you...

687
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:26,570
if theJedi destroy me...

688
01:09:26,710 --> 01:09:30,660
any chance of saving her will be lost.

689
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:04,010
Master Windu. I take it General Grievous has been destroyed then.

690
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:07,390
I must say you're here sooner than expected.

691
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:11,110
In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic...

692
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:13,150
you're under arrest, Chancellor.

693
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:15,850
Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?

694
01:11:15,990 --> 01:11:17,900
The senate will decide your fate.

695
01:11:18,030 --> 01:11:21,870
- I am the senate. - Not yet.

696
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:29,540
It's treason then.

697
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:12,060
You are under arrest, my lord.

698
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:17,490
Anakin, I told you it would come to this. I was right.

699
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:19,740
The Jedi are taking over.

700
01:13:19,870 --> 01:13:22,330
The oppression of the Sith will never return.

701
01:13:22,460 --> 01:13:24,660
You have lost.

702
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:26,170
No.

703
01:13:26,270 --> 01:13:28,500
No! No!

704
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:30,450
You will die!

705
01:13:33,220 --> 01:13:35,090
He's a traitor!

706
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:37,380
He is the traitor!

707
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:44,720
I have the power to save the one you love.

708
01:13:45,730 --> 01:13:47,640
You must choose.

709
01:13:48,730 --> 01:13:51,310
Don't listen to him, Anakin!

710
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:55,030
Don't let him kill me.

711
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:00,860
I can't hold it any longer.

712
01:14:02,210 --> 01:14:04,280
I can't. I'm weak.

713
01:14:04,420 --> 01:14:06,370
I'm too weak.

714
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,350
Anakin.

715
01:14:08,050 --> 01:14:10,500
Help me. Help me!

716
01:14:15,010 --> 01:14:17,170
I can't hold on any longer.

717
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:20,890
I am going to end this once and for all.

718
01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:22,480
You can't.

719
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,560
He must stand trial.

720
01:14:25,610 --> 01:14:28,010
He has control of the senate and the courts.

721
01:14:28,150 --> 01:14:30,360
He's too dangerous to be left alive.

722
01:14:30,490 --> 01:14:32,730
I'm too weak.

723
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:36,450
- Don't kill me. Please. - It's not the Jedi way.

724
01:14:36,570 --> 01:14:38,070
He must live.

725
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:43,740
- Please don't. - I need him.

726
01:14:44,790 --> 01:14:45,870
- Please don't! - No!

727
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:54,930
Power!

728
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:06,140
Unlimited power!

729
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,320
What have I done?

730
01:15:27,630 --> 01:15:31,540
You're fulfilling your destiny, Anakin.

731
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:35,460
Become my apprentice.

732
01:15:35,590 --> 01:15:41,020
Learn to use the dark side of the Force.

733
01:15:43,690 --> 01:15:46,640
I will do whatever you ask.

734
01:15:48,860 --> 01:15:51,270
Good.

735
01:15:52,990 --> 01:15:55,560
Just help me save Padm?s life.

736
01:15:57,530 --> 01:15:59,910
I can't live without her.

737
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:08,460
To cheat death is a power only one has achieved...

738
01:16:08,590 --> 01:16:11,540
but if we work together...

739
01:16:11,670 --> 01:16:15,670
I know we can discover the secret.

740
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:19,130
I pledge myself...

741
01:16:20,850 --> 01:16:22,720
to your teachings.

742
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:25,390
Good.

743
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:28,690
Good.

744
01:16:36,950 --> 01:16:41,360
The Force is strong with you.

745
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:47,040
A powerful Sith you will become.

746
01:16:47,170 --> 01:16:51,420
Henceforth you shall be known as...

747
01:16:51,550 --> 01:16:55,420
Darth... Vader.

748
01:17:00,390 --> 01:17:03,390
Thank you, my master.

749
01:17:05,610 --> 01:17:07,060
Rise.

750
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:25,670
Because the council did not trust you, my young apprentice...

751
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:32,000
I believe you are the only Jedi with no knowledge of this plot.

752
01:17:33,340 --> 01:17:36,050
When the Jedi learn what has transpired here...

753
01:17:36,180 --> 01:17:40,090
they will kill us, along with all the senators.

754
01:17:40,980 --> 01:17:42,350
I agree.

755
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:46,930
The council's next move will be against the senate.

756
01:17:47,060 --> 01:17:49,730
Every single Jedi...

757
01:17:49,860 --> 01:17:53,110
including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi...

758
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:56,770
is now an enemy of the Republic.

759
01:17:57,830 --> 01:17:59,780
I understand, Master.

760
01:18:00,580 --> 01:18:02,490
We must move quickly.

761
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:04,530
The Jedi are relentless.

762
01:18:04,670 --> 01:18:10,460
If they are not all destroyed, it will be civil war without end.

763
01:18:12,170 --> 01:18:15,960
First I want you to go to the Jedi temple.

764
01:18:17,050 --> 01:18:20,090
We will catch them off-balance.

765
01:18:20,310 --> 01:18:24,180
Do what must be done, Lord Vader.

766
01:18:24,310 --> 01:18:27,680
Do not hesitate. Show no mercy.

767
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:33,150
Only then will you be strong enough with the dark side...

768
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:35,270
to save Padm?

769
01:18:36,410 --> 01:18:40,240
What about the other Jedi spread across the galaxy?

770
01:18:40,370 --> 01:18:43,450
Their betrayal will be dealt with.

771
01:18:45,380 --> 01:18:48,630
After you have killed all the Jedi in the temple...

772
01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:51,420
go to the Mustafar system.

773
01:18:51,550 --> 01:18:54,800
Wipe out Viceroy Gunray...

774
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:58,340
and the other separatist leaders.

775
01:18:58,470 --> 01:19:04,350
Once more the Sith will rule the galaxy!

776
01:19:05,610 --> 01:19:07,310
And...

777
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:12,520
we shall have... peace.

778
01:19:55,740 --> 01:19:57,610
Sergeant, over here!

779
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:00,570
Hurry! All of them!

780
01:20:03,370 --> 01:20:05,250
All Red units, let's move it!

781
01:20:05,380 --> 01:20:07,250
Come on. Let's go!

782
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:23,130
Commander, contact your troops.

783
01:20:23,270 --> 01:20:25,180
Tell them to move to the higher levels.

784
01:20:25,310 --> 01:20:27,190
Very good, sir.

785
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:29,440
By the way, I think you'll be needing this.

786
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:33,810
Thank you, Cody. Let's get a move on. We've got a battle to win.

787
01:20:33,950 --> 01:20:35,110
Yes, sir.

788
01:20:41,910 --> 01:20:43,370
Commander Cody...

789
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:47,370
the time has come.

790
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:51,750
Execute order 66.

791
01:20:52,510 --> 01:20:54,420
Yes, my lord.

792
01:20:58,310 --> 01:20:59,630
Blast him!

793
01:21:26,630 --> 01:21:28,000
Come on!

794
01:22:18,430 --> 01:22:21,720
Execute order 66.

795
01:22:22,730 --> 01:22:24,350
It will be done, my lord.

796
01:23:07,190 --> 01:23:09,150
It will be done, my lord.

797
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:48,390
Master Skywalker, there are too many of them.

798
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:50,480
What are we going to do?

799
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,060
The chancellor's office indicated

800
01:24:03,060 --> 01:24:05,120
Master Anakin returned to the Jedi temple.

801
01:24:05,250 --> 01:24:08,330
Don't worry. I'm sure he'll be all right.

802
01:24:37,580 --> 01:24:40,610
- What's going on here? - There's been a rebellion, sir.

803
01:24:40,750 --> 01:24:43,320
Don't worry. The situation is under control.

804
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:46,660
I'm sorry, sir. It's time for you to leave.

805
01:24:48,420 --> 01:24:50,380
And so it is.

806
01:24:54,510 --> 01:24:55,970
Get him!

807
01:25:06,670 --> 01:25:08,540
No!

808
01:25:13,530 --> 01:25:15,400
Don't worry about him. Let him go.

809
01:25:42,310 --> 01:25:45,230
All these Wookiees are dead. Move to the east.

810
01:25:45,350 --> 01:25:46,810
Yes, sir.

811
01:25:54,950 --> 01:25:56,820
Goodbye, Tarfful.

812
01:25:56,950 --> 01:25:58,910
Goodbye, Chewbacca.

813
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:03,620
Miss you I will.

814
01:26:40,660 --> 01:26:42,990
Hopefully we'll be able to intercept a few Jedi...

815
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:45,410
before they walk into this catastrophe.

816
01:26:51,170 --> 01:26:53,080
Did you find Kenobi?

817
01:26:53,220 --> 01:26:55,130
Sir, no one could have survived that fall.

818
01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:58,500
Start loading your men on the ships.

819
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:00,100
Move it.

820
01:27:33,430 --> 01:27:35,420
Emergency code 913.

821
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:37,430
I have no contact on any frequency.

822
01:27:40,180 --> 01:27:41,590
Master Kenobi.

823
01:27:41,730 --> 01:27:43,680
- Repeat. - Master Kenobi.

824
01:27:43,810 --> 01:27:47,730
Senator Organa. My clone troops turned on me. I need help.

825
01:27:48,730 --> 01:27:50,610
We havejust rescued Master Yoda.

826
01:27:50,740 --> 01:27:52,810
It appears this ambush has happened everywhere.

827
01:27:52,950 --> 01:27:55,070
We're sending you our coordinates.

828
01:28:02,830 --> 01:28:04,710
Hush! Not so loud.

829
01:28:04,830 --> 01:28:07,830
Are you all right? I heard there was an attack on the Jedi temple.

830
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:10,330
- You could see the smoke from here. - I'm fine.

831
01:28:10,460 --> 01:28:12,340
I came to see if you and the baby are safe.

832
01:28:12,470 --> 01:28:14,090
What's happening?

833
01:28:14,970 --> 01:28:17,050
The Jedi have tried to overthrow the Republic.

834
01:28:17,810 --> 01:28:19,680
I can't believe that.

835
01:28:19,810 --> 01:28:23,340
I saw Master Windu attempt to assassinate the chancellor myself.

836
01:28:26,150 --> 01:28:27,940
Oh, Anakin. What are you gonna do?

837
01:28:36,660 --> 01:28:38,820
I will not betray the Republic.

838
01:28:40,830 --> 01:28:42,740
My loyalties lie with the chancellor...

839
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:46,620
and with the senate and with you.

840
01:28:47,420 --> 01:28:50,620
- What about Obi-Wan? - I don't know.

841
01:28:51,380 --> 01:28:53,460
Many Jedi have been killed.

842
01:28:53,590 --> 01:28:56,430
We can only hope that he's remained loyal to the chancellor.

843
01:28:57,510 --> 01:28:59,840
Anakin, I'm afraid.

844
01:29:02,850 --> 01:29:04,890
Have faith, my love.

845
01:29:05,020 --> 01:29:07,310
Everything will soon be set right.

846
01:29:08,110 --> 01:29:11,190
The chancellor has given me a very important mission.

847
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:14,150
The separatists have gathered on the Mustafar system.

848
01:29:14,910 --> 01:29:18,740
I'm going there to end this war. Wait for me until I return.

849
01:29:18,870 --> 01:29:21,240
Things will be different. I promise.

850
01:29:27,090 --> 01:29:29,040
Please, wait for me.

851
01:29:33,130 --> 01:29:35,840
Well, he is under a lot of stress, R2.

852
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:40,010
Take care, my little friend.

853
01:29:44,310 --> 01:29:47,980
Oh, my lady, is there anything I might do?

854
01:29:48,110 --> 01:29:50,650
No, thank you, 3PO.

855
01:29:53,030 --> 01:29:55,440
I feel so helpless.

856
01:30:19,010 --> 01:30:21,640
How many other Jedi have managed to survive?

857
01:30:21,770 --> 01:30:24,310
Heard from no one have we.

858
01:30:25,190 --> 01:30:28,270
I saw thousands of troops attack the Jedi temple.

859
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:30,270
That's why I went looking for Yoda.

860
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:32,810
Have we had any contact from the temple?

861
01:30:32,950 --> 01:30:35,900
Received a coded retreat message we have.

862
01:30:36,780 --> 01:30:40,030
It requests all Jedi to return to the temple.

863
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:43,580
- It says the war is over. - Then we must go back.

864
01:30:43,710 --> 01:30:45,460
If there are any stragglers,

865
01:30:45,460 --> 01:30:47,210
they will fall into the trap and be killed.

866
01:30:48,380 --> 01:30:52,130
Suggest dismantling the coded signal, do you?

867
01:30:52,260 --> 01:30:54,960
Yes, Master. There is too much at stake.

868
01:30:56,100 --> 01:30:57,640
I agree.

869
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:01,350
And a little more knowledge might light our way.

870
01:31:22,330 --> 01:31:25,750
The plan has gone as you had promised, my lord.

871
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:28,630
You have done well, Viceroy.

872
01:31:28,750 --> 01:31:34,540
When my new apprentice Darth Vader arrives...

873
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:38,180
he will take care of you.

874
01:31:50,570 --> 01:31:52,940
We're receiving a message from the chancellor's office, sir.

875
01:31:53,070 --> 01:31:54,980
- Send it through. - Yes, sir.

876
01:31:56,740 --> 01:32:01,400
Senator Organa, the supreme chancellor requests your presence...

877
01:32:01,540 --> 01:32:03,500
at a special session of Congress.

878
01:32:03,620 --> 01:32:07,160
- I will be there. - He'll be expecting you.

879
01:32:10,170 --> 01:32:13,420
- Could be a trap. - I don't think so.

880
01:32:13,550 --> 01:32:15,090
The chancellor will not be able to

881
01:32:15,090 --> 01:32:16,640
control the thousands of star systems...

882
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:18,670
without keeping the senate intact.

883
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:22,800
If a special session of Congress there is...

884
01:32:22,940 --> 01:32:26,220
easier for us to enter the Jedi temple it will be.

885
01:33:04,730 --> 01:33:06,690
R2, stay with the ship.

886
01:33:32,130 --> 01:33:35,130
Welcome, Lord Vader. We've been expecting you.

887
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:11,500
And the Jedi rebellion has been foiled.

888
01:34:11,630 --> 01:34:12,660
What's happened?

889
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:15,050
The chancellor's been elaborating on...

890
01:34:15,050 --> 01:34:17,300
a plot by the Jedi to overthrow the senate.

891
01:34:17,430 --> 01:34:22,890
The remaining Jedi will be hunted down and defeated.

892
01:34:38,700 --> 01:34:41,160
Not even the younglings survived.

893
01:34:42,290 --> 01:34:47,630
Killed not by clones this Padawan.

894
01:34:48,670 --> 01:34:51,290
By a lightsabre he was.

895
01:34:58,180 --> 01:34:59,720
Who?

896
01:34:59,850 --> 01:35:01,720
Who could have done this?

897
01:35:12,450 --> 01:35:15,610
The attempt on my life...

898
01:35:15,740 --> 01:35:20,620
has left me scarred and deformed.

899
01:35:21,580 --> 01:35:24,450
But I assure you.

900
01:35:24,580 --> 01:35:29,290
My resolve has never been stronger!

901
01:35:33,510 --> 01:35:34,710
Stop!

902
01:35:47,690 --> 01:35:53,310
In order to ensure the security and continuing stability...

903
01:35:53,450 --> 01:35:57,310
the Republic will be reorganized...

904
01:35:57,450 --> 01:36:02,910
into the first Galactic Empire!

905
01:36:03,830 --> 01:36:09,670
For a safe and secure society.

906
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:21,140
So this is how liberty dies.

907
01:36:21,890 --> 01:36:24,600
With thunderous applause.

908
01:36:27,020 --> 01:36:29,180
The war is over.

909
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:33,450
Lord Sidious promised us peace. We only want...

910
01:36:41,580 --> 01:36:46,240
I have recalibrated the code, warning all surviving Jedi to stay away.

911
01:36:46,380 --> 01:36:48,780
For the clones...

912
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:53,000
to discover the recalibration a long time it will take.

913
01:37:05,350 --> 01:37:06,810
Wait. Master.

914
01:37:08,360 --> 01:37:10,680
There is something I must know.

915
01:37:16,830 --> 01:37:21,240
If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find.

916
01:37:21,370 --> 01:37:23,910
I must know the truth, Master.

917
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:33,620
It can't be.

918
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:35,630
It can't be.

919
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:39,810
You have done well, my new apprentice.

920
01:37:39,930 --> 01:37:42,930
Now, Lord Vader...

921
01:37:43,060 --> 01:37:46,560
go and bring peace to the Empire.

922
01:37:46,690 --> 01:37:48,850
I can't watch any more.

923
01:37:49,610 --> 01:37:53,520
Destroy the Sith we must.

924
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:57,400
Send me to kill the emperor.

925
01:37:57,530 --> 01:37:59,780
I will not kill Anakin.

926
01:37:59,910 --> 01:38:04,620
To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough you are not.

927
01:38:04,750 --> 01:38:08,000
He is like my brother. I cannot do it.

928
01:38:08,750 --> 01:38:13,800
Twisted by the dark side young Skywalker has become.

929
01:38:13,930 --> 01:38:17,300
The boy you trained, gone he is.

930
01:38:17,430 --> 01:38:20,300
Consumed by Darth Vader.

931
01:38:20,430 --> 01:38:23,430
I do not know where the emperor has sent him.

932
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:25,770
I don't know where to look.

933
01:38:27,110 --> 01:38:30,770
Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and find him you will.

934
01:38:41,330 --> 01:38:43,320
When was the last time you saw him?

935
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:47,410
- Yesterday. - And do you know where he is now?

936
01:38:47,790 --> 01:38:49,760
No.

937
01:38:50,590 --> 01:38:53,920
Padme, I need your help.

938
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:57,260
- He is in grave danger. - From the Sith?

939
01:38:58,060 --> 01:38:59,510
From himself.

940
01:39:01,070 --> 01:39:03,170
Padme...

941
01:39:03,980 --> 01:39:06,350
Anakin has turned to the dark side.

942
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:09,930
You're wrong. How could you even say that?

943
01:39:12,740 --> 01:39:17,730
I have seen a security hologram... of him...

944
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:21,080
killing younglings.

945
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:24,240
Not Anakin. He couldn't.

946
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,290
He was deceived by a lie. We all were.

947
01:39:28,170 --> 01:39:31,040
It appears that the chancellor is behind everything,

948
01:39:31,140 --> 01:39:31,920
including the war.

949
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:36,460
Palpatine is the Sith lord we've been looking for.

950
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:40,680
After the death of Count Dooku, Anakin became his new apprentice.

951
01:39:46,900 --> 01:39:48,860
I don't believe you.

952
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:51,740
I can't.

953
01:39:56,630 --> 01:39:59,120
Padme...

954
01:39:59,950 --> 01:40:02,200
I must find him.

955
01:40:04,330 --> 01:40:06,660
You're going to kill him, aren't you?

956
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:12,840
He has become a very great threat.

957
01:40:15,470 --> 01:40:16,930
I can't.

958
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:32,560
Anakin is the father, isn't he?

959
01:40:36,990 --> 01:40:38,950
I'm so sorry.

960
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:27,210
- Milady, let me come with you. - There's no danger.

961
01:41:27,340 --> 01:41:29,290
The fighting's over. And this is personal.

962
01:41:29,420 --> 01:41:31,790
As you wish, milady, but I strongly disagree.

963
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:35,540
I'll be all right, Captain. This is something I must do myself.

964
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:38,050
Besides, 3PO will look after me.

965
01:41:40,310 --> 01:41:41,770
Oh, dear.

966
01:41:53,740 --> 01:41:55,550
Do you know? I think I'm beginning to...

967
01:41:55,550 --> 01:41:57,360
get the hang of this flying business.

968
01:42:25,730 --> 01:42:29,150
The separatists have been taken care of, my master.

969
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:32,150
It is finished then.

970
01:42:33,570 --> 01:42:39,360
You have restored peace and justice to the galaxy.

971
01:42:40,160 --> 01:42:44,370
Send a message to the ships of the Trade Federation.

972
01:42:45,210 --> 01:42:49,670
All droid units must shut down immediately.

973
01:42:50,550 --> 01:42:52,500
Very good, my lord.

974
01:43:51,780 --> 01:43:53,850
I saw your ship.

975
01:43:56,700 --> 01:43:59,700
- What are you doing out here? - I was so worried about you.

976
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:04,000
Obi-Wan told me terrible things.

977
01:44:04,120 --> 01:44:05,670
What things?

978
01:44:06,380 --> 01:44:09,290
He said you've turned to the dark side.

979
01:44:09,420 --> 01:44:14,050
That you... killed younglings.

980
01:44:15,590 --> 01:44:18,260
Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me.

981
01:44:18,390 --> 01:44:20,260
He cares about us.

982
01:44:20,980 --> 01:44:22,140
Us?

983
01:44:22,270 --> 01:44:23,730
He knows.

984
01:44:25,100 --> 01:44:26,980
He wants to help you.

985
01:44:30,820 --> 01:44:34,070
Anakin, all I want is your love.

986
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:36,520
Love won't save you, Padm?

987
01:44:36,660 --> 01:44:39,860
- Only my new powers can do that. - At what cost?

988
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,370
You're a good person. Don't do this.

989
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:45,200
I won't lose you the way I lost my mother.

990
01:44:45,330 --> 01:44:49,550
I am becoming more powerful than any Jedi has ever dreamed of.

991
01:44:49,670 --> 01:44:52,460
And I'm doing it for you. To protect you.

992
01:44:53,800 --> 01:44:55,760
Come away with me.

993
01:44:56,510 --> 01:44:58,500
Help me raise our child.

994
01:44:58,640 --> 01:45:01,430
Leave everything else behind while we still can.

995
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:05,470
Don't you see? We don't have to run away any more.

996
01:45:06,310 --> 01:45:08,810
I have brought peace to the Republic.

997
01:45:09,860 --> 01:45:11,770
I am more powerful than the chancellor.

998
01:45:11,900 --> 01:45:13,980
I can overthrow him.

999
01:45:16,070 --> 01:45:19,110
And together, you and I can rule the galaxy...

1000
01:45:19,240 --> 01:45:21,650
make things the way we want them to be.

1001
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
I don't believe what I'm hearing.

1002
01:45:31,510 --> 01:45:34,790
Obi-Wan was right. You've changed.

1003
01:45:37,010 --> 01:45:39,850
I don't want to hear any more about Obi-Wan.

1004
01:45:40,720 --> 01:45:44,140
The Jedi turned against me. Don't you turn against me.

1005
01:45:45,860 --> 01:45:47,850
I don't know you any more.

1006
01:45:48,750 --> 01:45:50,720
Anakin...

1007
01:45:51,570 --> 01:45:53,530
You're breaking my heart.

1008
01:45:54,240 --> 01:45:57,190
You're going down a path I can't follow.

1009
01:45:58,200 --> 01:46:00,080
Because of Obi-Wan?

1010
01:46:00,870 --> 01:46:02,950
Because of what you've done.

1011
01:46:03,080 --> 01:46:04,990
What you plan to do.

1012
01:46:06,250 --> 01:46:08,870
Stop. Stop now. Come back.

1013
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,920
- I love you. - Liar!

1014
01:46:14,070 --> 01:46:15,940
No.

1015
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:20,510
You're with him! You brought him here to kill me.

1016
01:46:21,980 --> 01:46:23,550
Let her go, Anakin.

1017
01:46:26,770 --> 01:46:28,930
Let her go.

1018
01:46:38,950 --> 01:46:40,940
You turned her against me!

1019
01:46:42,580 --> 01:46:44,740
You have done that yourself.

1020
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:51,660
You will not take her from me!

1021
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:55,630
Your anger and your lust for power have already done that.

1022
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:03,930
You have allowed this dark lord to twist your mind...

1023
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:08,690
until now you have become the very thing you swore to destroy.

1024
01:47:08,820 --> 01:47:10,690
Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan.

1025
01:47:10,820 --> 01:47:13,310
I see through the lies of the Jedi.

1026
01:47:14,450 --> 01:47:16,820
I do not fear the dark side as you do.

1027
01:47:18,660 --> 01:47:20,570
I have brought peace...

1028
01:47:20,700 --> 01:47:25,450
freedom, justice and security to my new empire.

1029
01:47:26,460 --> 01:47:28,580
Your new empire?

1030
01:47:29,420 --> 01:47:31,460
Don't make me kill you.

1031
01:47:32,840 --> 01:47:37,340
Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic, to democracy!

1032
01:47:38,220 --> 01:47:40,180
If you're not with me...

1033
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:42,970
then you're my enemy.

1034
01:47:45,020 --> 01:47:47,480
Only a Sith deals in absolutes.

1035
01:47:50,030 --> 01:47:51,900
I will do what I must.

1036
01:47:52,610 --> 01:47:54,980
You will try.

1037
01:48:26,770 --> 01:48:30,770
I hear a new apprentice you have, Emperor.

1038
01:48:30,900 --> 01:48:35,360
Or should I call you Darth Sidious?

1039
01:48:35,490 --> 01:48:38,060
Master Yoda.

1040
01:48:38,200 --> 01:48:39,860
You survived.

1041
01:48:40,750 --> 01:48:42,120
Surprised?

1042
01:48:42,830 --> 01:48:47,410
Your arrogance blinds you, Master Yoda.

1043
01:48:47,540 --> 01:48:49,580
Now you will experience...

1044
01:48:49,710 --> 01:48:54,170
the full power of the dark side.

1045
01:49:36,140 --> 01:49:41,810
I have waited a long time for this moment...

1046
01:49:41,930 --> 01:49:47,100
my little green friend.

1047
01:49:57,330 --> 01:50:00,780
At last the Jedi are no more.

1048
01:50:00,910 --> 01:50:05,120
Not if anything to say about it I have.

1049
01:50:10,460 --> 01:50:12,790
At an end your rule is.

1050
01:50:14,680 --> 01:50:17,130
And not short enough it was.

1051
01:50:21,890 --> 01:50:24,100
If so powerful you are...

1052
01:50:25,350 --> 01:50:26,810
why leave?

1053
01:50:27,770 --> 01:50:30,310
You will not stop me.

1054
01:50:30,440 --> 01:50:35,020
Darth Vader will become more powerful than either of us.

1055
01:50:35,160 --> 01:50:39,490
Faith in your new apprentice misplaced may be.

1056
01:50:40,830 --> 01:50:44,870
As is your faith in the dark side of the Force.

1057
01:55:12,530 --> 01:55:15,230
Hurry. Careful timing we will need.

1058
01:55:15,370 --> 01:55:18,150
Activate your homing beacon when you're ready.

1059
01:55:18,280 --> 01:55:20,610
There's no sign of his body, sir.

1060
01:55:20,750 --> 01:55:24,360
- Then he is not dead. - Double your search.

1061
01:55:24,500 --> 01:55:26,740
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

1062
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:31,920
Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle for immediate take-off.

1063
01:55:32,050 --> 01:55:37,130
- Yes, Master. - I sense Lord Vader is in danger.

1064
01:56:45,960 --> 01:56:49,130
Into exile I must go.

1065
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:51,910
Failed I have.

1066
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:33,270
I have failed you, Anakin.

1067
01:58:33,400 --> 01:58:35,280
I have failed you.

1068
01:58:35,410 --> 01:58:38,280
I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over.

1069
01:58:38,410 --> 01:58:41,200
Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil!

1070
01:58:41,330 --> 01:58:43,950
From my point of view, the Jedi are evil.

1071
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:45,660
Then you are lost!

1072
01:58:57,550 --> 01:59:00,050
This is the end for you, my master.

1073
01:59:24,580 --> 01:59:27,700
It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground.

1074
01:59:30,380 --> 01:59:33,050
You underestimate my power.

1075
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:35,550
Don't try it.

1076
01:59:58,450 --> 02:00:00,410
You were the chosen one!

1077
02:00:01,910 --> 02:00:05,080
It was said that you would destroy the Sith, not join them!

1078
02:00:07,750 --> 02:00:11,540
Bring balance to the Force, not leave it in darkness!

1079
02:00:23,230 --> 02:00:25,550
I hate you!

1080
02:00:32,990 --> 02:00:35,280
You were my brother, Anakin.

1081
02:00:37,330 --> 02:00:39,650
I loved you.

1082
02:01:20,700 --> 02:01:23,620
Master Kenobi. We have Miss Padme on board.

1083
02:01:23,750 --> 02:01:25,830
Yes. Please, please hurry.

1084
02:01:25,960 --> 02:01:28,790
We should leave this dreadful place.

1085
02:01:40,060 --> 02:01:42,030
Obi-Wan

1086
02:01:44,350 --> 02:01:46,310
Is Anakin all right?

1087
02:02:55,140 --> 02:02:57,090
Your Majesty, this way.

1088
02:02:58,060 --> 02:02:59,930
There he is.

1089
02:03:00,060 --> 02:03:02,220
He's still alive.

1090
02:03:05,230 --> 02:03:07,440
Get a medical capsule immediately.

1091
02:03:07,570 --> 02:03:09,520
Yes, sir. Right away.

1092
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:47,430
Excuse me, Master Yoda.

1093
02:03:53,360 --> 02:03:55,520
Obi-Wan Kenobi has made contact.

1094
02:04:12,380 --> 02:04:14,790
We'll take her to the medical centre. Quickly.

1095
02:04:45,130 --> 02:04:47,330
Medically, she's completely healthy.

1096
02:04:47,460 --> 02:04:50,660
For reasons we can't explain, we are losing her.

1097
02:04:52,050 --> 02:04:54,750
- She's dying? - We don't know why.

1098
02:04:54,890 --> 02:04:56,930
She has lost the will to live.

1099
02:04:57,050 --> 02:05:00,170
We need to operate quickly if we are to save the babies.

1100
02:05:00,310 --> 02:05:01,890
Babies?

1101
02:05:02,020 --> 02:05:03,890
She's carrying twins.

1102
02:05:46,060 --> 02:05:47,520
Luke.

1103
02:05:55,740 --> 02:05:57,200
Oh, Luke.

1104
02:06:19,680 --> 02:06:22,010
- It's a girl. - Leia.

1105
02:07:03,820 --> 02:07:06,450
Obi-Wan.

1106
02:07:11,490 --> 02:07:13,360
There's good in him.

1107
02:07:16,070 --> 02:07:17,450
I know.

1108
02:07:18,160 --> 02:07:21,740
I know there's... still...

1109
02:07:56,990 --> 02:07:58,450
Lord Vader.

1110
02:07:59,790 --> 02:08:01,910
Can you hear me?

1111
02:08:04,960 --> 02:08:06,420
Yes, Master.

1112
02:08:09,550 --> 02:08:11,420
Where is Padm?

1113
02:08:13,260 --> 02:08:15,130
Is she safe?

1114
02:08:16,260 --> 02:08:18,250
Is she all right?

1115
02:08:19,970 --> 02:08:24,520
It seems, in your anger, you killed her.

1116
02:08:25,560 --> 02:08:28,430
I couldn't have.

1117
02:08:28,570 --> 02:08:31,570
She was alive. I felt it!

1118
02:08:50,560 --> 02:08:54,860
No!

1119
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:09,140
Hidden, safe the children must be kept.

1120
02:09:10,940 --> 02:09:12,710
We must take them somewhere where

1121
02:09:12,710 --> 02:09:14,480
the Sith will not sense their presence.

1122
02:09:17,030 --> 02:09:19,160
Split up they should be.

1123
02:09:19,870 --> 02:09:21,780
My wife and I will take the girl.

1124
02:09:23,370 --> 02:09:26,240
We've always talked of adopting a baby girl.

1125
02:09:26,380 --> 02:09:28,620
She will be loved with us.

1126
02:09:29,550 --> 02:09:31,500
And what of the boy?

1127
02:09:32,470 --> 02:09:35,970
To Tatooine. To his family send him.

1128
02:09:37,810 --> 02:09:40,210
I will take the child and watch over him.

1129
02:09:45,690 --> 02:09:49,350
Until the time is right, disappear we will.

1130
02:09:51,190 --> 02:09:54,780
Master Kenobi, wait a moment.

1131
02:09:56,320 --> 02:10:01,530
In your solitude on Tatooine, training I have for you.

1132
02:10:02,870 --> 02:10:04,150
Training?

1133
02:10:04,290 --> 02:10:08,870
An old friend has learned the path to immortality.

1134
02:10:10,920 --> 02:10:14,010
One who has returned from the netherworld of the Force.

1135
02:10:14,130 --> 02:10:16,540
Your old master.

1136
02:10:17,260 --> 02:10:18,720
Qui-Gon?

1137
02:10:21,270 --> 02:10:24,520
How to commune with him I will teach you.

1138
02:10:26,020 --> 02:10:28,150
- Captain Antilles. - Yes, Your Highness?

1139
02:10:28,270 --> 02:10:30,150
I'm placing these droids in your care.

1140
02:10:30,280 --> 02:10:32,150
Treat them well. Clean them up.

1141
02:10:32,280 --> 02:10:34,150
Have the protocol droid's mind wiped.

1142
02:10:34,280 --> 02:10:35,740
What?

1143
02:10:36,830 --> 02:10:38,800
Oh, no.
