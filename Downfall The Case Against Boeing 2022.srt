3
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:46,017
AIR TRAFFIC: Lion Inter 610
cleared for takeoff, runway 2-5 left.

4
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,853
CO-PILOT: Lion Inter 610
cleared for takeoff, 2-5 left.

5
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,748
CO-PILOT: Indicated Airspeed Disagree,
Captain.

6
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:14,712
CO-PILOT: Feel Differential.

7
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:22,262
CO-PILOT: Altitude Disagree, Captain!

8
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,981
AIR TRAFFIC: Lion Inter 610?

9
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,191
CO-PILOT:
We have a flight control problem!

10
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:41,906
CO-PILOT: Fly up! Fly up!

11
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,818
PILOT: These guys didn't even know
the damn system was on the airplane,

12
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,069
nor did anybody else.

13
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:36,156
BOEING: We try not to overload the crews 
with information that's unnecessary.

14
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,201
PILOT: I would think
there would be a priority

15
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:42,037
on explanations of things
that could kill you.

16
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,748
BOEING: We take your point.
We really do.

17
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:49,128
PILOT: Is there something being done
where Boeing might address

18
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,130
ways to make sure it doesn't happen again?

19
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:54,716
BOEING: Well, we're looking at relatively
straightforward software changes

20
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,970
that we expect we can get out
in a fairly short period of time…

21
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,179
maybe six weeks.

22
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,906
BOEING: Because no one has yet concluded

23
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:21,535
that the sole cause of this
was dysfunction of the airplane.

24
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:21,870
Between me and you,

25
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:24,456
they didn't put a shim 
on the landing gear yesterday.

26
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:26,875
On the lugs. Night shift didn't.

27
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:31,588
They said we don't have time 
to fucking put it on.
