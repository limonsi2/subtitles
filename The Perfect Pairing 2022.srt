00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,000
Hey.

6
00:00:25,934 --> 00:00:27,800
Okay.

7
00:00:27,934 --> 00:00:30,567
Christina Joy Osborne?

8
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,333
Uh-oh.
Busting out the middle name.

9
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:36,667
Um, am I in trouble?

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,066
Your review
of Heublein Chophouse

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,734
ruffled a few feathers.

12
00:00:39,867 --> 00:00:41,834
They served Kevin's steak 15
minutes after mine

13
00:00:41,967 --> 00:00:43,934
and by the time he got his,
mine was cold.

14
00:00:44,066 --> 00:00:45,734
Ruined the entire meal.

15
00:00:45,867 --> 00:00:47,567
You know, technically, you're
allowed to eat if it's hot.

16
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,100
No one ever does that.

17
00:00:49,233 --> 00:00:50,333
Oh, come. Would you sit down?

18
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,100
My feet hurt
just looking at you.

19
00:00:52,233 --> 00:00:53,433
Oh, I'm fine.

20
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:56,934
I'll just sit for a second.

21
00:00:57,066 --> 00:01:01,633
Now, here is your next
assignment.

22
00:01:01,767 --> 00:01:03,200
Oh. Winter wine festival.

23
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:05,033
Well, you haven't done
a wine review

24
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:07,233
since Hollingbrook's
corked merlot.

25
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:09,700
Um, I probably
shouldn't show my face

26
00:01:09,834 --> 00:01:11,333
at that particular winery.

27
00:01:11,467 --> 00:01:13,834
You won't need to.
There are a dozen other wineries

28
00:01:13,967 --> 00:01:15,367
doing barrel tastings
that same week.

29
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,000
Hmm.

30
00:01:17,133 --> 00:01:18,667
That's your all-access pass
for the entire event.

31
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,667
You'll get a sneak preview
of their newest vintages.

32
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,900
Report on the wines
getting the most buzz.

33
00:01:23,033 --> 00:01:24,700
In January, though?

34
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,400
The winemakers like to see

35
00:01:26,533 --> 00:01:27,967
how things are progressing
while their wines are aging.

36
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,700
It's like touring
a house during construction.

37
00:01:29,834 --> 00:01:32,200
Buyers can get a feeling for
how the wine is going to finish.

38
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:34,066
Oh. Now, you'll take
the Amtrak in,

39
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,133
but then, you'll transfer to
this adorable vintage train

40
00:01:37,266 --> 00:01:38,800
that'll take you
right into town.

41
00:01:38,934 --> 00:01:41,367
Do you think I could get
an extra pass for Kevin?

42
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,200
It seems pretty romantic.
We could make it a work-cation.

43
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:47,967
Good idea.
Maybe he'll be inspired.

44
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,333
Stop it.

45
00:01:50,934 --> 00:01:52,867
Mom, you want some more coffee?

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,800
Please.

47
00:01:54,934 --> 00:01:56,333
Oh, but you don't need to do

48
00:01:56,467 --> 00:01:58,700
the whole complicated,
you know, thing here.

49
00:01:58,834 --> 00:02:00,600
Um, of course
I'm doing the thing.

50
00:02:00,734 --> 00:02:03,400
I've got it down to a science.
It turns out perfect every time.

51
00:02:04,934 --> 00:02:07,767
So, when you and Kevin
finally get engaged,

52
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,633
be sure to register for
a plain old drip coffee maker.

53
00:02:11,767 --> 00:02:13,734
Well, you might be waiting
for a while.

54
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:15,300
Okay.

55
00:02:15,433 --> 00:02:18,633
Oh. All right. This is it.

56
00:02:18,767 --> 00:02:22,133
If I can't get it right
this time, I swear, I give up.

57
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,467
Aha.

58
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,700
Looks good.

59
00:02:28,834 --> 00:02:29,934
Come on.

60
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,066
Ugh.

61
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,233
Christina...

62
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:35,567
I don't understand.

63
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,800
I did everything
the recipe said. Ugh.

64
00:02:38,934 --> 00:02:40,767
Baking is as much art
as it is science.

65
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,266
Maybe you just need to embrace
the art a little more.

66
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,767
Yeah, or I could embrace
that new dessert delivery app.

67
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,367
But then you'll miss
all the fun.

68
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,433
Ugh. Well, this isn't
that fun either, Mom.

69
00:02:50,567 --> 00:02:53,533
Sometimes it isn't about
the final product, sweetheart.

70
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:54,867
It's about how you get there.

71
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,767
That sounds like a quote
people put on

72
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,800
reclaimed barn wood, Mom.

73
00:02:58,934 --> 00:03:00,433
- Because it's true.
- Well, not for everyone.

74
00:03:00,567 --> 00:03:02,266
Some people
like to know what's coming.

75
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,600
Like when people
go to a restaurant

76
00:03:03,734 --> 00:03:05,533
or order a bottle of wine,

77
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:07,667
they don't want to risk
wasting their time or money,

78
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,633
and that's why I do
what I do.

79
00:03:09,767 --> 00:03:12,700
We can't control everything
in our lives, Chrissy.

80
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:15,433
No one really knows
what's down the road.

81
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,934
What do you think, Michael?
These ready for harvesting?

82
00:03:24,066 --> 00:03:26,033
Almost.

83
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,767
We're supposed to be getting
another freeze this week, Gene.

84
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,800
If that happens, I think
these grapes are going to be

85
00:03:30,934 --> 00:03:32,266
at their absolute sweetest.

86
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,934
Michael?

87
00:03:34,066 --> 00:03:35,500
Yeah?

88
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:37,333
We just got a shipment
of these ice wine glasses.

89
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,200
Can you call the distributor
and tell him he made a mistake?

90
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:42,633
The distributor didn't make
a mistake, Dad. I ordered them.

91
00:03:42,767 --> 00:03:44,333
For the tapping party
next Friday. Come on.

92
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:45,834
I mean, we got to
get people to sample

93
00:03:45,967 --> 00:03:47,600
our first batch of ice wine.
You know that.

94
00:03:47,734 --> 00:03:49,266
I don't think it's a good idea

95
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,934
to introduce something new
right now, Michael.

96
00:03:51,066 --> 00:03:52,767
We're trying to regroup

97
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,266
from what that C.J. Osborne
review did to our bottom line.

98
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,633
I thought we both agreed

99
00:03:57,767 --> 00:03:59,266
to never mention that name
ever again.

100
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,734
Believe me.

101
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:03,033
I want to forget
it ever happened, too.

102
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,700
I'm just trying to create
some buzz. That's all.

103
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:06,400
I mean, come on. You know
everybody in this region--

104
00:04:06,533 --> 00:04:08,166
No one's doing ice wine.
You know that.

105
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,433
For very good reason.

106
00:04:09,567 --> 00:04:10,867
- What?
- It's too risky.

107
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,233
It was risky back in the day,

108
00:04:12,367 --> 00:04:13,734
when you tried it,
but things have changed.

109
00:04:13,867 --> 00:04:15,567
Dad, come on.
Forecasting, soil testing--

110
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,900
Merlot, cabernet, pinot noir,

111
00:04:18,033 --> 00:04:20,533
that's what built
this winery a hundred years ago,

112
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:22,166
and that's what's going
to keep it going

113
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,500
for the next generation,
for you and for Britney.

114
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:27,233
Dad,
we've got 500 bottles of wine

115
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,867
from last year's harvest
sitting in that ice room, okay?

116
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,200
Not to mention,
these grapes are almost frozen

117
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:32,867
for this year's harvest.

118
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,667
Come on. Why don't we just
show them what we've got?

119
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,400
It's temporary.

120
00:04:36,533 --> 00:04:38,867
You know how much it costs
to maintain that ice wine room?

121
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,433
We'll finish this harvest and
then we'll go back to normal.

122
00:04:41,567 --> 00:04:44,166
What if normal
is not good enough, Dad?

123
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,500
It will be.

124
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:48,333
Grandpa, the sign at the front
fell again.

125
00:04:48,467 --> 00:04:51,100
Oh. I'll take a
look at it, sweetie.

126
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:53,900
Maybe I'll leave it down and
wait for the new one to come.

127
00:04:54,033 --> 00:04:55,367
We'll talk later, all right?

128
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,667
As long as
it's about merlot, cabernet--

129
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,500
Pinot noir. Dad, we get it.

130
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,834
Okay.

131
00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:04,066
Dad, can I have
some frozen grapes?

132
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,834
Of course you can,
but you can only have two.

133
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:08,300
We need all the grapes
to make the wine, all right?

134
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,233
I know, but I can't have that
for nine more years.

135
00:05:10,367 --> 00:05:11,633
I'm your dad,

136
00:05:11,767 --> 00:05:13,734
and you can't have that
for 90, all right?

137
00:05:15,934 --> 00:05:17,333
So, you're going to
go for it anyway?

138
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:22,300
Gene, come on.
The grapes are already frozen.

139
00:05:22,433 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm not going to
let them go to waste.

140
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:26,367
Old man will come around.

141
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,333
You know,
her mom used to do that.

142
00:05:31,467 --> 00:05:32,900
Wander around the vineyard,

143
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,333
eating grapes like
there was no tomorrow.

144
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,000
I can't believe
it's been three years.

145
00:05:37,433 --> 00:05:40,100
Yeah.

146
00:05:40,233 --> 00:05:43,233
Sara loved the idea
of the ice wine.

147
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:44,633
I got to follow through
with it, Gene.

148
00:05:44,767 --> 00:05:47,200
I have to. For her, for Britney.

149
00:05:49,066 --> 00:05:50,934
Hey, princess,

150
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:52,934
I see you're wearing another one
of Mom's hats again, huh?

151
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:54,600
I like wearing them.
Oh.

152
00:05:54,734 --> 00:05:55,834
It's like a head hug.

153
00:05:55,967 --> 00:05:57,900
Oh. A head hug, huh?

154
00:05:58,033 --> 00:05:59,467
Well, how about a hug
for the rest of you?

155
00:06:01,433 --> 00:06:02,700
I love you.

156
00:06:02,834 --> 00:06:04,567
Love you, too.

157
00:06:15,033 --> 00:06:16,800
Hi. Should be under "Kevin."

158
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:20,700
So, which table
is C.J. Osborne at?

159
00:06:20,834 --> 00:06:23,066
I don't know.
No one knows what he looks like.

160
00:06:25,834 --> 00:06:27,533
Oh, honey, look.

161
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:29,233
That's my friend C.J.
and his wife.

162
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:32,200
No, no. But let's not go over
there and talk to them.

163
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,567
I think-- I think he's working.

164
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,233
Okay.

165
00:06:37,967 --> 00:06:40,300
That guy is the most feared food
critic on the East Coast?

166
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,400
Maybe that's just his disguise.

167
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:44,800
We have to pretend
we don't know him.

168
00:06:44,934 --> 00:06:47,000
Fine. Just give him
anything he wants.

169
00:06:48,266 --> 00:06:50,233
Go.

170
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,400
This is why
I love being anonymous.

171
00:06:56,533 --> 00:06:58,633
I can give my readers
a completely honest,

172
00:06:58,767 --> 00:07:01,567
authentic experience
of the restaurant,

173
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,867
and someone else
gets treated like royalty.

174
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,200
Win-win.

175
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:08,066
Hmm.

176
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,734
So, what do you think?
It's fantastic, right?

177
00:07:11,867 --> 00:07:14,266
Could be better.
I mean, the spices in the purée

178
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,467
overpower the glaze.

179
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,200
What?

180
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,700
Maybe once in a while,
you could give someone a pass.

181
00:07:20,834 --> 00:07:22,667
Then I wouldn't be doing my job.

182
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,066
Speaking of which,

183
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,233
Sam has me going to
this winter wine festival

184
00:07:28,367 --> 00:07:29,700
in upstate New York.

185
00:07:29,834 --> 00:07:31,567
He booked me in
this gorgeous B&B.

186
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,233
It's very romantic.

187
00:07:33,367 --> 00:07:34,867
I mean, come on.

188
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,467
We keep saying we need to
talk about our future.

189
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,233
This would be perfect.

190
00:07:38,367 --> 00:07:41,266
Yeah, yeah.
We will get away, Chrissy.

191
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,767
But I've got client meetings
all week.

192
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,066
I can't just take time off.

193
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,867
Except you also say

194
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,100
that the market is too volatile
to plan ahead.

195
00:07:50,233 --> 00:07:51,400
I mean, it's always something.

196
00:07:51,533 --> 00:07:52,800
Well,
I've got to do my work, too.

197
00:07:52,934 --> 00:07:54,467
I just think
it would be good for us.

198
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,200
Come on.
We could use a reset.

199
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,433
Could we?
I mean, I thought we were...

200
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:02,200
...I thought we were fine.

201
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:06,367
We are, but...

202
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,567
...we should be
better than fine.

203
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:11,300
Okay. Maybe I can--

204
00:08:11,433 --> 00:08:13,600
I can call in a couple favors.

205
00:08:13,734 --> 00:08:15,100
But I'll have to meet you
up there.

206
00:08:15,233 --> 00:08:16,967
Thank you, Kevin.

207
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,300
I promise
it'll be an amazing time.

208
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:21,333
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

209
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,367
All right.
Talk to me. How we looking?

210
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,967
All right.
Well, the high tables

211
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,300
will be here
the day before the party.

212
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,300
The wine glasses
get here tomorrow.

213
00:08:39,433 --> 00:08:41,133
Oh. Write down
I got a few dessert glasses

214
00:08:41,266 --> 00:08:42,967
for the ice wine as well.

215
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,867
I thought we weren't bringing
out those bottles for the party.

216
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,133
How can I not? Come on.

217
00:08:46,266 --> 00:08:47,433
Last year's batch is perfect.

218
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:49,266
It's time to show it off.

219
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,600
Yeah. Mike, listen. I know how
important this is to you, okay?

220
00:08:52,734 --> 00:08:55,033
But Sara wouldn't want this to
come between you and your dad.

221
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,600
Well, unfortunately, Diane,

222
00:08:56,734 --> 00:08:58,433
that debacle with the merlot
already did that.

223
00:08:58,567 --> 00:09:00,333
Yeah, but it wasn't your fault
that the corks were tainted.

224
00:09:00,467 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah, but it's my fault
that I didn't test the case

225
00:09:02,133 --> 00:09:04,000
before I sent the bottles
to that reviewer.

226
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:05,767
My dad thinks
it's because I was obsessed

227
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,433
about the ice wine at
the expense of everything else.

228
00:09:07,567 --> 00:09:09,033
That's not the case.
You know that.

229
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,433
Michael, I'm going to head
to the train station

230
00:09:10,567 --> 00:09:11,934
and drop off
some pamphlets for our party

231
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:13,567
at the welcome centre.
Do you need anything?

232
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,166
Yeah, actually. I do.
I could use a carload of buyers

233
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,400
with money to burn.

234
00:09:16,533 --> 00:09:19,233
I'll do my best.

235
00:09:19,367 --> 00:09:20,500
You two--

236
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:21,900
All right. Talk to me.
What else?

237
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:23,166
Okay.

238
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,500
Next stop is Hudson.

239
00:09:24,633 --> 00:09:26,867
Please exit through this car.

240
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:33,367
Hey, Kevin.

241
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,033
My train just arrived.
Perfect timing.

242
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,767
What time does yours leave?

243
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,166
Oh, and I got us
a reservation tonight

244
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,867
at the Hudson Grill at 8:00.

245
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,367
I'm not even reviewing it,
so we can just enjoy ourselves.

246
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,767
Kevin?

247
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,734
Chris, I can't make it tomorrow.

248
00:09:45,867 --> 00:09:47,367
I'm really sorry.

249
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,033
No. It's fine.

250
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,233
Um, so-- Thank you.

251
00:09:51,367 --> 00:09:53,900
So, what day do you think
you can make it?

252
00:09:54,033 --> 00:09:56,266
Look. We had a problem
with one of the funds, Chris.

253
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,700
I don't know when
I can make it up there.

254
00:09:57,834 --> 00:09:59,066
Oh, excuse me, miss.

255
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,100
You're blocking
the luggage cart.

256
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:01,166
Oh. Uh--

257
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,433
Do you need help with your bag?

258
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:03,700
Sorry.
Um, yes, please. Thank you.

259
00:10:03,834 --> 00:10:05,233
It's the black one right there.

260
00:10:05,367 --> 00:10:07,000
All right.

261
00:10:07,133 --> 00:10:08,734
Well, can you make it for
the last three days at least?

262
00:10:08,867 --> 00:10:10,000
Where to?

263
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:11,767
Hudson House B&B.

264
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,066
It's the black SUV over there.
I'll load your bag for you.

265
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,500
Oh, okay. Thank you.

266
00:10:15,633 --> 00:10:18,100
Look. I got to hop back into
a meeting.

267
00:10:18,233 --> 00:10:19,400
No, no.
Please, please don't hang up.

268
00:10:19,533 --> 00:10:20,734
We can figure this out.

269
00:10:20,867 --> 00:10:22,367
Listen.

270
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,700
Why don't you just call me back
from the hotel, okay?

271
00:10:23,834 --> 00:10:25,567
No. I--
Kevin, I need to know right now.

272
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,166
Are you even coming up here
or not?

273
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,000
I can't make it, Chris.

274
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,166
I'll talk to you later.

275
00:10:42,734 --> 00:10:45,400
Hello, Christina.

276
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:46,867
Eleanor. Hi.

277
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,533
It's been ages.

278
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:51,066
I know. I've been meaning
to call and catch up.

279
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,433
You here for the wine festival?

280
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,066
Of course. You?

281
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,900
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

282
00:10:57,033 --> 00:10:58,533
There's nothing better
than finding

283
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:00,800
that one special wine
nobody knows about yet.

284
00:11:00,934 --> 00:11:02,300
Or the ones to avoid.

285
00:11:04,266 --> 00:11:06,633
That's exactly why we couldn't
be writing partners anymore.

286
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:10,100
We have completely different
ways of seeing the same thing.

287
00:11:10,233 --> 00:11:12,934
I just want people
to be informed, that's all.

288
00:11:13,066 --> 00:11:14,734
Nothing wrong with
a little honesty.

289
00:11:14,867 --> 00:11:16,900
So much honesty from someone

290
00:11:17,033 --> 00:11:19,066
who won't even reveal
who she is.

291
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:23,600
I should get going.

292
00:11:23,734 --> 00:11:24,934
It was good to see you, Eleanor.

293
00:11:25,066 --> 00:11:26,400
You, too.

294
00:11:32,967 --> 00:11:34,233
Kevin
Hey. This is Kevin.

295
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:36,000
Leave a message
and I'll get back to you.

296
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:39,133
You know what, Kevin?
Never mind.

297
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:42,667
It's fine, because I'm going to
be really busy with work anyway.

298
00:11:46,367 --> 00:11:47,734
Uh, hi.

299
00:11:47,867 --> 00:11:49,967
Apologies if there's been a mix-up,

300
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,333
but this isn't
the official shuttle.

301
00:11:52,467 --> 00:11:53,967
I'm just here running an errand.

302
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,400
No. This is the car
the porter told me to take.

303
00:11:56,533 --> 00:12:00,834
Oh, okay. Not a problem.

304
00:12:16,467 --> 00:12:18,967
Okay. Here we are.

305
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,467
Oh, no. My purse.
I left it on the train.

306
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,734
I think it was under the seat.
We have to go back.

307
00:12:24,867 --> 00:12:26,633
Oh, I'm sorry, miss,
but that train is long gone.

308
00:12:26,767 --> 00:12:29,000
But don't worry.
I'm sure someone turned it in.

309
00:12:29,133 --> 00:12:30,900
I'll call the station's
lost and found.

310
00:12:31,033 --> 00:12:34,667
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay.
If can just get my bag--

311
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,834
- Bag?
- Yeah. It's in the back.

312
00:12:41,934 --> 00:12:44,066
What?

313
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,834
She told me she put it in there.

314
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:48,533
Let me make
that phone call for you.

315
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:50,300
Then, I'll get you
back to the station.

316
00:12:50,433 --> 00:12:52,900
Okay. Thank you, but will
they let me check in without ID?

317
00:12:53,033 --> 00:12:55,233
Check in?

318
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:57,867
I think you better
talk to Michael.

319
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,200
He's over there.

320
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,500
Okay.

321
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:10,467
Uh, excuse me?

322
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,600
- Oh, hey there.
- Hi.

323
00:13:12,734 --> 00:13:15,300
Hey.
What can I do for you?

324
00:13:15,433 --> 00:13:17,100
Hi. Hi.

325
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:20,567
Um, I wanted to get checked in,
but I don't have my ID.

326
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,100
Oh, that's okay.
We don't really have a formal

327
00:13:22,233 --> 00:13:23,867
check-in policy here.

328
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,633
It's usually just
first come, first serve.

329
00:13:25,767 --> 00:13:27,400
Then what was the point of
making a reservation?

330
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:29,400
Well, I have no idea who made
the reservation for you,

331
00:13:29,533 --> 00:13:31,233
but it's fine.

332
00:13:31,367 --> 00:13:33,133
Why don't you come on in and
I'll try to get you some help?

333
00:13:33,266 --> 00:13:34,400
- Okay.
- Okay?

334
00:13:34,533 --> 00:13:36,900
Oh, and
I'm sorry about your grapes.

335
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:38,867
What do you mean?

336
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,734
Well, it looks like you
kind of missed the harvest.

337
00:13:41,867 --> 00:13:44,533
Not if you're making ice wine.

338
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:47,700
Don't most wineries
use a freezer

339
00:13:47,834 --> 00:13:49,300
and make it with the
grapes they already have?

340
00:13:49,433 --> 00:13:50,767
Yes, they do.
That's very true.

341
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,467
But it's not really the same.

342
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,600
You see, nothing
brings out the sweetness

343
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:58,200
like the slow build of winter,
and if we can time this harvest

344
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:01,767
just right, the flavor
will be absolutely perfect.

345
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,300
And you, as the customer,
know exactly what you get.

346
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:06,700
I can certainly appreciate that.

347
00:14:06,834 --> 00:14:08,467
All right.

348
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,834
Well, it's getting cold.
Let's get you inside, huh?

349
00:14:09,967 --> 00:14:11,100
Okay. Thank you.

350
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:12,600
- Come on.
- Okay. Ooh!

351
00:14:12,734 --> 00:14:16,133
I can see you, uh,
brought the right shoes.

352
00:14:16,266 --> 00:14:17,834
Oh, I didn't know you
get so much snow up here.

353
00:14:19,633 --> 00:14:22,000
If it's okay, I'd like to
check into my room first

354
00:14:22,133 --> 00:14:24,133
before doing
any wine-tasting, please.

355
00:14:24,266 --> 00:14:27,200
I'm sorry, but these rooms
are for private residents only.

356
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,467
But I can call and recommend
a couple of hotels in town.

357
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,000
I thought this was a hotel.

358
00:14:31,133 --> 00:14:34,433
No, no, it's not.
We're, uh-- We're just a winery.

359
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,433
This is Hollingbrook Winery?

360
00:14:40,567 --> 00:14:42,333
It is, yeah, and I'm
Michael Hollingbrook. You are?

361
00:14:42,467 --> 00:14:44,867
I'm in the wrong place.

362
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,533
I need to go.

363
00:14:49,633 --> 00:14:52,000
Oh. Oh, no.

364
00:14:52,133 --> 00:14:54,700
Oh.
Uh, where did the driver go?

365
00:14:54,834 --> 00:14:56,667
Well, Gino,
he'll be back in a second.

366
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,367
Not to worry.
Listen. While you're here,

367
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,600
why don't you come back inside
and warm up a little bit

368
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,633
and try a glass of our merlot?
It's wonderful.

369
00:15:06,133 --> 00:15:10,066
Oh, okay. I see you've read our
recent review to the contrary.

370
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,934
Completely untrue and,

371
00:15:12,066 --> 00:15:15,033
to be honest,
bordering on unprofessional.

372
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:18,233
Usually, when things get bad
reviews it's for a good reason.

373
00:15:18,367 --> 00:15:21,400
True. There was a good reason.
We made an honest mistake.

374
00:15:21,533 --> 00:15:23,233
But instead of allowing us
to rectify the situation,

375
00:15:23,367 --> 00:15:25,233
the reviewer decided
to trash us instead

376
00:15:25,367 --> 00:15:28,233
and well, we lost a lot
of business because of it.

377
00:15:28,367 --> 00:15:29,934
I'm very sorry to hear that.

378
00:15:30,066 --> 00:15:31,834
Well, nothing
we can do about it now.

379
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:34,233
We'll just get back
on our feet, all right?

380
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:35,533
- Dad?
- Yeah.

381
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:36,834
Do you want me to put out

382
00:15:36,967 --> 00:15:38,100
all the barrel-tapping
festival merch?

383
00:15:38,233 --> 00:15:39,700
I think that's
a great idea, honey.

384
00:15:39,834 --> 00:15:41,000
Hi. I'm Britney.

385
00:15:41,133 --> 00:15:43,734
Hi. I'm... Joy.

386
00:15:43,867 --> 00:15:46,500
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

387
00:15:46,633 --> 00:15:48,200
How do you walk
on those in the snow?

388
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,333
Aren't you afraid
you're going to slip and fall?

389
00:15:50,467 --> 00:15:52,533
Hasn't happened yet.

390
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,900
Oh, excuse me.
I just have to take this.

391
00:15:56,033 --> 00:15:58,200
No problem.

392
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,600
Whoa, whoa.

393
00:16:00,734 --> 00:16:02,600
Hey, hey, hey.

394
00:16:02,734 --> 00:16:04,633
Are you okay?

395
00:16:04,767 --> 00:16:08,600
Why?

396
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:09,834
Are you okay?

397
00:16:09,967 --> 00:16:11,266
Ooh.

398
00:16:13,967 --> 00:16:15,166
I think I'll stay right here.

399
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,667
Okay.

400
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,400
Well, Joy, good news.
Your vitals are all normal,

401
00:16:22,533 --> 00:16:24,600
and I can't see
any sign of head trauma

402
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,800
or concussion.

403
00:16:26,934 --> 00:16:28,233
Who's Joy?

404
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:31,433
You are.
I'm Britney. Remember?

405
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:32,734
We just met.

406
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:33,967
We did?

407
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,300
Do you know where you live?

408
00:16:35,433 --> 00:16:37,967
I think in the city.

409
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,233
Which city?

410
00:16:39,367 --> 00:16:42,266
I don't...

411
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,800
...I don't know.

412
00:16:43,934 --> 00:16:45,166
Oh, dear.

413
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,667
What? What's wrong with me?

414
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,834
I think you have a case of
retrograde amnesia.

415
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,333
What's that?

416
00:16:51,467 --> 00:16:54,567
It's an inability to recall
recent events.

417
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,600
The brain is shutting down
the part that needs to heal.

418
00:16:56,734 --> 00:16:59,100
How long will I be like this?

419
00:16:59,233 --> 00:17:00,667
Well, that's the good news.

420
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,233
Most patients
with no outward signs of trauma

421
00:17:03,367 --> 00:17:05,000
get their full memory back
in three to seven days.

422
00:17:05,133 --> 00:17:06,667
Okay.

423
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,667
Until then, we should
be able to figure out

424
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,066
a lot from your phone.

425
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,367
Speaking of which,
when she fell, doc,

426
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,000
her phone dropped in mud
and water,

427
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:16,000
and her cell won't power up.

428
00:17:16,133 --> 00:17:17,667
So, I'm going to head into town,

429
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,567
talk to a repair guy
and see what we can do. Okay?

430
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,700
Okay. What about my wallet?

431
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:23,367
Where's my purse?

432
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,633
You left it
on the train, remember?

433
00:17:25,767 --> 00:17:27,500
Uh, I'm sure
she doesn't remember, Gene.

434
00:17:27,633 --> 00:17:31,066
Right. Right. I am trying
to find it, and your bag.

435
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,700
I don't have that, either?

436
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:34,867
You were only carrying
your notebook.

437
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,100
What? This?

438
00:17:38,867 --> 00:17:42,834
What is all this? Recipes?
What am I? A chef?

439
00:17:42,967 --> 00:17:45,500
Is someone waiting for me
to show up somewhere?

440
00:17:45,633 --> 00:17:47,200
Am I married?

441
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,000
Do I have kids, or cats?

442
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:51,300
Did I mention
any friends or family?

443
00:17:53,433 --> 00:17:55,567
Is anyone looking for me?

444
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,500
We don't know.

445
00:17:57,633 --> 00:17:59,300
All we know is that
you seemed to

446
00:17:59,433 --> 00:18:01,367
come to our winery by mistake.

447
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,633
Did I say where
I was supposed to be?

448
00:18:03,767 --> 00:18:06,300
No. Sorry.

449
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:08,600
But if this
memory card will get fired up

450
00:18:08,734 --> 00:18:10,266
and start working again,
we can find out.

451
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,934
We'll also contact the police.

452
00:18:12,066 --> 00:18:13,433
You're going to be okay.

453
00:18:13,567 --> 00:18:15,467
Hey.

454
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,066
We'll figure it out.

455
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,900
Well, what if we don't?

456
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:22,066
What am I going to do?

457
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,266
You need to stay somewhere safe
for a few days

458
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,300
until your memory returns.

459
00:18:26,433 --> 00:18:28,100
She can stay with us.

460
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:30,967
Now, Brit, we don't
even know this person.

461
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,633
Well, if she's a criminal,

462
00:18:32,767 --> 00:18:35,700
she's the most fashionable
criminal I've ever seen.

463
00:18:35,834 --> 00:18:36,934
You know what I mean.

464
00:18:37,066 --> 00:18:38,433
I know Mom said

465
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:39,700
we should always look
for ways to help people,

466
00:18:39,834 --> 00:18:41,467
and Joy needs help.

467
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,533
Is your mom--

468
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:44,934
She died three years ago.

469
00:18:45,066 --> 00:18:47,266
Oh. I'm so sorry.

470
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,200
Let's get you upstairs.

471
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:53,133
Oh, I don't know
if it's okay with your dad yet.

472
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:58,900
It's fine. Come on. Let's go.

473
00:18:59,033 --> 00:19:00,467
Okay.

474
00:19:08,867 --> 00:19:10,567
I'll set you
over here on the couch.

475
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,834
- Okay.
- Okay?

476
00:19:11,967 --> 00:19:13,533
Yeah. Thank you so much.

477
00:19:17,066 --> 00:19:18,166
Okay?
Yeah.

478
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,500
Is that her?

479
00:19:19,633 --> 00:19:21,300
The one who fell?
Yeah.

480
00:19:21,433 --> 00:19:22,734
Is she going to sue us?

481
00:19:22,867 --> 00:19:26,300
Dad, are you kidding me?
Come on. Uh, Joy?

482
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:28,000
This is my father,
John Hollingbrook.

483
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,800
Hi.
It's nice to meet you.

484
00:19:29,934 --> 00:19:31,767
I'm so sorry for the trouble.

485
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,834
I don't mean to be
any inconvenience.

486
00:19:33,967 --> 00:19:36,433
No problem. We just want to
make sure you're okay.

487
00:19:36,567 --> 00:19:38,567
No. I'm fine,

488
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,333
except for the part that I don't
remember anything about myself.

489
00:19:42,467 --> 00:19:44,166
Nothing? Nothing at all?

490
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,767
All I have is this notebook.

491
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,333
Are there any clues in there?

492
00:19:48,467 --> 00:19:50,600
Only that I seem to be
an extremely organized

493
00:19:50,734 --> 00:19:52,300
dessert enthusiast.

494
00:19:52,433 --> 00:19:54,467
We just learned
about this in science.

495
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,633
Smells are
a huge trigger for memories.

496
00:19:57,767 --> 00:20:00,600
Maybe making one of these
recipes will jog yours.

497
00:20:00,734 --> 00:20:02,734
Maybe.

498
00:20:02,867 --> 00:20:05,300
I'm sorry.

499
00:20:05,433 --> 00:20:08,300
Um, is there a place
I can lie down?

500
00:20:08,433 --> 00:20:09,567
Absolutely.

501
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,400
- Of course. Come on.
- Okay.

502
00:20:11,533 --> 00:20:12,734
Dr. Grayson says that sleep is
the best thing right now, so--

503
00:20:12,867 --> 00:20:14,100
Thank you.

504
00:20:14,233 --> 00:20:15,500
You're welcome to
use our guest room.

505
00:20:15,633 --> 00:20:17,233
Thanks.

506
00:20:28,033 --> 00:20:31,734
Oh, I can't tell you how much
I appreciate all of this.

507
00:20:31,867 --> 00:20:34,400
I don't know what I would have
done without your help.

508
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:37,300
Well, it's okay.
You're safe here.

509
00:20:37,433 --> 00:20:39,800
Everything will be just fine.

510
00:20:39,934 --> 00:20:41,667
Well, you don't know that.

511
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,900
No, I don't.

512
00:20:44,033 --> 00:20:46,166
But what I do know is that
we're doing everything we can.

513
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,834
Gene is talking to
all the wineries and the hotels

514
00:20:48,967 --> 00:20:50,433
to see if anybody
is looking for you.

515
00:20:50,567 --> 00:20:51,834
But in the meantime,

516
00:20:51,967 --> 00:20:53,433
we just need to take it
moment by moment. Okay?

517
00:20:53,567 --> 00:20:54,967
Okay.

518
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,000
So, in this particular moment,

519
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:00,633
I'm still completely
freaking out.

520
00:21:02,934 --> 00:21:04,633
Still freaking out.

521
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,800
Still freaked out.
How am I doing?

522
00:21:10,934 --> 00:21:12,467
You're doing great.

523
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,533
Well, um, I guess I should
try and get some sleep.

524
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:17,834
Yeah. That's probably best.

525
00:21:17,967 --> 00:21:19,400
All right. Sleep well.

526
00:21:19,533 --> 00:21:22,467
- Thank you.
- All right.

527
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,200
Christina Hi.

528
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,533
You've reached
Christina Osborne.

529
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:26,967
I can't come to
the phone right now.

530
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,867
So, if you'd like to
leave your name, number,

531
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,133
and a brief message, I'll get
back to you as soon as I can.

532
00:21:31,266 --> 00:21:33,867
Hey, it's me again.

533
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,734
Look.
I get that you're mad, okay?

534
00:21:35,867 --> 00:21:37,166
I wish I could have been
up there, but...

535
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,700
...ignoring my texts
and my calls,

536
00:21:39,834 --> 00:21:41,000
it's not helping anything.

537
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,734
Thank you.

538
00:21:42,867 --> 00:21:46,266
Look. Just call me
when you're ready to talk, okay?

539
00:22:21,066 --> 00:22:23,033
Okay.

540
00:22:27,033 --> 00:22:29,400
Uh, okay.

541
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,600
Hey.

542
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:49,433
Oh.

543
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:51,066
Sorry.

544
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,633
No. I'm sorry.

545
00:22:52,767 --> 00:22:54,600
I didn't think
anyone would be up.

546
00:22:54,734 --> 00:22:58,233
Yeah, I'm just-- I'm not
a really big sleeper, so--

547
00:22:58,367 --> 00:23:01,600
Okay. Well, I don't want to be
in your way.

548
00:23:01,734 --> 00:23:03,633
I'll just put everything back
and go to bed.

549
00:23:03,767 --> 00:23:06,367
No, it's okay. Why don't you
tell me what you're making?

550
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:10,433
Um, I was going to try one of
the recipes from my notebook,

551
00:23:10,567 --> 00:23:13,667
see if that triggered
anything from my childhood.

552
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,200
Ah, okay. All right.
Well, don't let me stop you.

553
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:18,367
I just have to admit,
I'm a little surprised

554
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,500
that you can find
enough ingredients to use.

555
00:23:20,633 --> 00:23:22,433
You're not a big cook, then?

556
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,433
Oh, I make a really great
chicken, if I do say so myself.

557
00:23:25,567 --> 00:23:27,200
I think if Britney wanted
to be a vegetarian, though,

558
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:28,767
we'd both starve to death.

559
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:32,667
Well, this is
a pretty basic recipe,

560
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,633
so I think we should be okay.

561
00:23:34,767 --> 00:23:37,300
Um, where do you keep
the anchovies?

562
00:23:37,433 --> 00:23:38,967
I'm sorry?

563
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,367
I'm kidding.

564
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,033
Oh. Hey, good.

565
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:43,867
I thought it was some
sort of weird regional thing,

566
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,500
although I wouldn't have
any idea what region.

567
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,633
Quick. What is your address?

568
00:23:50,266 --> 00:23:52,467
You're trying the hiccup
technique on amnesia?

569
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,700
Well, that depends. Did it work?

570
00:23:53,834 --> 00:23:55,200
No.

571
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,166
Then, no, I'm not, actually.

572
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,533
You took my advice.

573
00:23:58,667 --> 00:24:00,500
Oh. Hey, honey.

574
00:24:00,633 --> 00:24:02,667
Oh. I'm so sorry
if we woke you up.

575
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,734
That's okay. Now that I know
what it is, can I help?

576
00:24:05,867 --> 00:24:07,600
It's the middle
of the night, honey.

577
00:24:07,734 --> 00:24:09,900
It's a weekend and we haven't
baked anything in this kitchen

578
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:12,266
in a long time.

579
00:24:14,467 --> 00:24:15,767
True.
Well, if it's okay with Joy.

580
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,600
Of course.

581
00:24:17,734 --> 00:24:19,367
All right.
I have some paperwork to finish,

582
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,900
and I'll let you two get to it.

583
00:24:21,033 --> 00:24:22,400
- Thanks, Dad.
- All right, honey.

584
00:24:22,533 --> 00:24:24,333
So, what are we making?

585
00:24:24,467 --> 00:24:26,600
Grandma's famous cookies.

586
00:24:26,734 --> 00:24:29,367
Do you think Grandma would be
mad if we added butterscotch?

587
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,066
Um, it's not in the recipe,
so I don't know.

588
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,834
Let's try anyway.
I think we have some chips.

589
00:24:36,967 --> 00:24:40,567
Uh, okay.

590
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,400
Now what? Pecans?

591
00:24:42,533 --> 00:24:46,633
Oh. Well, that's not
in here either, so, um--

592
00:24:48,734 --> 00:24:50,400
You know what?

593
00:24:50,533 --> 00:24:52,767
How about
butterscotch and pecans?

594
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,266
- Yes.
- Yeah.

595
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,400
Ooh, and how about cinnamon?

596
00:24:56,533 --> 00:24:58,600
Oh, and do you
have pumpkin pie spice?

597
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,633
Hey, princess, come on. We got
to get you back to bed, okay?

598
00:25:13,767 --> 00:25:15,967
- Come on.
- But I want to try them.

599
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,800
I'll put them in the fridge

600
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:20,066
and we will bake them first
thing in the morning, okay?

601
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,066
Okay. Did this help you
remember anything?

602
00:25:24,433 --> 00:25:27,333
Not yet,
but I had a blast making them.

603
00:25:27,467 --> 00:25:29,333
Me, too.

604
00:25:29,467 --> 00:25:30,600
Okay, honey. Come on.

605
00:25:30,734 --> 00:25:31,834
Good night.

606
00:25:31,967 --> 00:25:33,800
- Good night.
- Good night.

607
00:25:33,934 --> 00:25:35,900
Good night.

608
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,633
We should put it
inside, so she knows it's there.

609
00:25:48,767 --> 00:25:50,934
I don't want to wake her.

610
00:25:51,066 --> 00:25:53,667
She needs to rest if she's going
to get her memory back.

611
00:25:57,333 --> 00:25:58,467
Oops.

612
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,834
Hi.

613
00:25:59,967 --> 00:26:01,266
Sorry.
We didn't mean to wake you.

614
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,834
No, no. It's okay.
I was awake.

615
00:26:02,967 --> 00:26:05,734
I'm Diane.
A close friend of the family's.

616
00:26:05,867 --> 00:26:09,066
It's nice to meet you.
I'm... Joy, apparently.

617
00:26:10,467 --> 00:26:11,867
I hope you don't mind.

618
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,233
I brought you
some clean clothes,

619
00:26:13,367 --> 00:26:15,767
comfy shoes
and some basic toiletries.

620
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,000
Oh, that's so kind of you.
Thank you so much.

621
00:26:19,133 --> 00:26:20,600
Yeah. I can't believe
I actually wore those.

622
00:26:20,734 --> 00:26:23,834
They're like
little leather torture chambers.

623
00:26:23,967 --> 00:26:27,100
Yeah. I'm more of a "comfort
first" kind of gal myself.

624
00:26:27,233 --> 00:26:30,333
Right now, I'll take
all the comfort I can get.

625
00:26:30,467 --> 00:26:32,266
Can I go put the cookies in?

626
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,934
Oh, yeah. That's a great idea.

627
00:26:35,567 --> 00:26:37,934
I heard about
your late-night baking session.

628
00:26:38,066 --> 00:26:40,000
Well, I'm not sure how those
cookies are going to turn out.

629
00:26:40,133 --> 00:26:43,200
We didn't exactly follow
the recipe.

630
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:44,700
Oh, well.
Some of the best things

631
00:26:44,834 --> 00:26:46,367
happen in life
when you take a little detour.

632
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,934
I'll leave you to it.

633
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:49,867
Thanks. Thank you again.
You're welcome.

634
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:59,867
Betsy? Betsy, can you get me
Christina's review

635
00:27:00,066 --> 00:27:01,834
of Badgley's Bistro
from Friday night?

636
00:27:01,967 --> 00:27:04,166
She hasn't submitted it yet.

637
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:07,066
Well, that's odd. She said
she'd finish it on the train.

638
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,767
Maybe she really is taking
some time for some romance.

639
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,700
Good for her.

640
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:15,967
More than one piece,
though, right?

641
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,400
- Good morning.
- 'Morning.

642
00:27:17,533 --> 00:27:18,800
- 'Morning.
- Hi.

643
00:27:18,934 --> 00:27:21,066
Wow.

644
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,467
I-- Yeah. I mean,

645
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,967
Diane's clothes
fit you perfectly.

646
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,500
Now, you don't have to,
you know, obviously,

647
00:27:26,633 --> 00:27:28,066
wear the same clothes
every single day.

648
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,500
Not that
those clothes weren't nice.

649
00:27:29,633 --> 00:27:32,166
I mean, you-- Um, you--

650
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,467
- Dad...
- You look great. Yeah?

651
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,934
Stop being weird.

652
00:27:35,066 --> 00:27:36,433
What? I thought weird
is what I'm good at.

653
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:38,000
Oh.

654
00:27:38,133 --> 00:27:39,333
The cookies are cool.

655
00:27:39,467 --> 00:27:41,333
Yep.

656
00:27:41,467 --> 00:27:43,934
Listen.
Um, it's been a long time

657
00:27:44,066 --> 00:27:46,834
since she had this much fun
in the kitchen, so thank you.

658
00:27:46,967 --> 00:27:49,767
Well, I think I had
more fun than she did.

659
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,100
But I'm a little nervous
to taste them, though.

660
00:27:52,233 --> 00:27:53,433
I'm not getting my hopes up.

661
00:27:53,567 --> 00:27:55,000
- Okay.
- Okay.

662
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:56,734
Here we go.
I'll give you a nice big one.

663
00:27:56,867 --> 00:27:58,066
Mmm.
Okay.

664
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,834
Which one do you want?

665
00:27:59,967 --> 00:28:01,467
Okay.
On the count of three. Ready?

666
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,700
Yep.

667
00:28:02,834 --> 00:28:04,900
One, two, three.

668
00:28:11,133 --> 00:28:12,233
These are amazing.

669
00:28:12,367 --> 00:28:13,567
They are, aren't they?

670
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,500
So good.

671
00:28:16,633 --> 00:28:18,400
Is it triggering your memory?

672
00:28:20,467 --> 00:28:22,734
No.

673
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,400
Well, that's my fault.

674
00:28:24,533 --> 00:28:26,367
Should have followed
the exact recipe.

675
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,867
Honey...
- No. It was worth it.

676
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,500
But, um,

677
00:28:30,633 --> 00:28:32,533
have you heard anything
this morning, though?

678
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:34,834
Has anyone said
they were looking for me?

679
00:28:34,967 --> 00:28:36,900
No. Nothing yet, Joy.
I'm sorry.

680
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,967
What if I'm a fugitive
or something?

681
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,467
Dad basically
said the same thing.

682
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,200
Okay. All right.
Thank you.

683
00:28:48,333 --> 00:28:51,834
Well, if I'm wanted, at least
I know someone's looking for me.

684
00:28:51,967 --> 00:28:53,667
You know, maybe if I read
today's newspaper,

685
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,133
something will
trigger my memory.

686
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:57,300
- Yeah.
- Do you mind?

687
00:28:57,433 --> 00:28:59,367
Yeah, of course. Go ahead.

688
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,533
Okay. Hmm.

689
00:29:03,734 --> 00:29:05,700
Anything?

690
00:29:09,033 --> 00:29:10,467
Oh, look at this.

691
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,367
What? Is it about you?

692
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,300
No. It's about you guys.

693
00:29:15,433 --> 00:29:16,900
Yeah, this is a lot
more nerve-wracking

694
00:29:17,033 --> 00:29:18,367
than exciting, but thank you.

695
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,934
So, listen.
I think these cookies--

696
00:29:20,066 --> 00:29:21,700
As a matter of fact,
I know these cookies

697
00:29:21,834 --> 00:29:24,300
would pair perfectly with
the ice wine at the tasting.

698
00:29:24,433 --> 00:29:27,266
Oh. Do you make that here?

699
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,767
Yeah, I was-- Right.

700
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,767
Um, I told you, but you--
I told you before you fell.

701
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,200
- Oh.
- So--

702
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:36,467
- Thank you, honey.
- Yeah. Of course.

703
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,467
What do you-- What do you say?
Do you want to try them?

704
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,967
Absolutely.

705
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,767
All right. Don't eat them all.

706
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,100
I'll try.

707
00:29:43,233 --> 00:29:44,467
Or at least save us one.

708
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,433
- Yeah.
- Okay. Bye, guys.

709
00:29:46,567 --> 00:29:48,333
Okay.

710
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:56,033
Okay. So, you are going to need
one of these.

711
00:29:57,233 --> 00:29:59,100
For what?

712
00:29:59,233 --> 00:30:01,066
Well, a couple years ago,

713
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,133
Gene and I built
a very special ice wine room.

714
00:30:05,266 --> 00:30:08,934
And trust me, you are going
to need one of those.

715
00:30:09,066 --> 00:30:10,200
Come on.

716
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:13,433
Oh, wow. This is incredible.

717
00:30:13,567 --> 00:30:16,266
Oh, incredibly cold.

718
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,200
Yeah.

719
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:20,133
That's a lot of ice.

720
00:30:20,266 --> 00:30:22,734
It helps us
keep it at 14 degrees,

721
00:30:22,867 --> 00:30:24,567
which is
the exact temperature you need

722
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,567
when you're harvesting
ice wine grapes.

723
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,367
We're hoping to hit it
in the next few days.

724
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,066
People must love coming
down here for the tour.

725
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,967
Oh. Well, no. They're not
going to be touring this room,

726
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,300
unfortunately.

727
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:38,467
It's temporary.
In about a year or so,

728
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,400
when it melts, this will be it.
It'll be gone.

729
00:30:40,533 --> 00:30:41,800
Why?

730
00:30:41,934 --> 00:30:43,967
Well, my dad says
it's too expensive

731
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,867
to maintain an ice wine room
at 14 degrees.

732
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,867
He wants us to just
rely on what we know best

733
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,033
and try to get
our customers back, so--

734
00:30:52,166 --> 00:30:53,767
Back?

735
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,934
Oh. I'm sorry.

736
00:30:56,066 --> 00:30:58,367
You don't remember.
We were-- Before you fell,

737
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,133
I was telling you that
about a year ago,

738
00:31:00,266 --> 00:31:03,500
we sent out a corked merlot.

739
00:31:03,633 --> 00:31:06,800
And the review we got back,
we lost a lot of business.

740
00:31:06,934 --> 00:31:08,533
So, all those
buyers and reviewers

741
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:10,033
that are coming to the party,

742
00:31:10,166 --> 00:31:11,767
we need to make sure
that we win them back.

743
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,467
I'm sure you will.

744
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,767
Well, these reviewers
are very brutal.

745
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,500
That's for you.

746
00:31:19,633 --> 00:31:21,834
They don't care about the
impact they have on businesses.

747
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:23,200
for some reason.
You know, they decide,

748
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:24,667
they write their reviews,
they leave,

749
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,166
and then, you know,
that's it, we're done.

750
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,200
And then, we're left
picking up the pieces.

751
00:31:28,333 --> 00:31:30,200
Well, they don't sound
like very happy people.

752
00:31:30,333 --> 00:31:33,266
Looking for the negative in
everything must be exhausting.

753
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,333
Yeah.

754
00:31:35,467 --> 00:31:39,467
Okay. One sip, just to be safe.

755
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,266
Why?

756
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,433
Well, I don't know if amnesia

757
00:31:43,567 --> 00:31:46,433
and wine will mix too well, so--

758
00:31:46,567 --> 00:31:48,200
I have amnesia?

759
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:49,934
Are you kidding me?

760
00:31:50,066 --> 00:31:51,533
Yes.

761
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:52,967
Yes. Okay.

762
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,967
Well, all right.
I'm going to make a toast.

763
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,467
Okay.

764
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,000
To you getting your memory back.

765
00:32:06,367 --> 00:32:08,333
Oh, Michael.

766
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,667
This is incredible.

767
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,767
- It's good, right?
- Oh, my goodness.

768
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,000
It's exactly
how I wanted it to taste.

769
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:18,100
Mmm.

770
00:32:18,233 --> 00:32:21,667
You know, my wife, um--

771
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,533
It's okay. Your wife.

772
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:28,433
My wife, obviously, wasn't here
for the final product, but...

773
00:32:30,066 --> 00:32:32,533
...I think she'd love this.

774
00:32:32,667 --> 00:32:34,567
Everyone will.

775
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,600
You have to serve this
at the party.

776
00:32:36,734 --> 00:32:38,166
- Thank you very much.
- Mmm.

777
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,900
But for all intents
and purposes,

778
00:32:40,033 --> 00:32:42,533
this is your first sip of wine,
so the bar is pretty low.

779
00:32:42,667 --> 00:32:45,533
- True. Okay.
- What?

780
00:32:45,667 --> 00:32:47,033
Tell me how they taste together.

781
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:50,300
Ah, okay. I'm going to
go with this one here.

782
00:32:57,333 --> 00:32:59,300
Oh. Those are good.

783
00:33:06,066 --> 00:33:08,133
What do you think?

784
00:33:08,266 --> 00:33:10,834
Wow.

785
00:33:10,967 --> 00:33:12,166
- Really?
- Amazing.

786
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,767
- Oh.
- They pair perfectly together.

787
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,233
And I had all the
ingredients to make these?

788
00:33:16,367 --> 00:33:17,734
Mm-hmm.
You know, sometimes,

789
00:33:17,867 --> 00:33:19,233
it just takes a different
perspective to see

790
00:33:19,367 --> 00:33:21,200
what you already have
right in front of you.

791
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,934
Maybe that's all your dad needs;

792
00:33:25,066 --> 00:33:29,667
to see the ice wine
from your point of view.

793
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,133
You know, maybe in real life,
you were a philosopher.

794
00:33:33,266 --> 00:33:36,600
I don't know about that.
Okay. I'm going to try them.

795
00:33:36,734 --> 00:33:37,934
Okay.

796
00:33:40,567 --> 00:33:42,400
Mmm.

797
00:33:47,633 --> 00:33:48,767
They are good together.

798
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,633
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, my goodness.

799
00:33:52,233 --> 00:33:53,667
I hope you can remember
how to make these.

800
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,500
I hope I remember
a lot more than that.

801
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,667
But I'll never forget
the last 24 hours.

802
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,233
Cheers.

803
00:34:05,367 --> 00:34:06,667
Neither will I.

804
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,500
So, I just got off the phone
with the police again.

805
00:34:18,633 --> 00:34:20,700
They haven't heard anything
about anyone missing

806
00:34:20,834 --> 00:34:23,333
and unfortunately,
no sign of your purse or bag.

807
00:34:23,467 --> 00:34:26,200
Well, I hate to think
no one's looking for me.

808
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:29,600
But I guess in a way it's good.

809
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,567
I mean, it means
I probably don't have any kids

810
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,667
or a husband.

811
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,734
But I must have someone, right?

812
00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:38,834
Of course you do.
You're amazing.

813
00:34:38,967 --> 00:34:40,166
She's not wrong, you know.

814
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:43,166
I'm sure someone
will find you soon.

815
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,900
Well, you should eat.
keep your strength up.

816
00:34:45,033 --> 00:34:46,734
Well,
I wouldn't know where to start.

817
00:34:46,867 --> 00:34:49,333
I just make one big pile
on my plate and eat my way down.

818
00:34:49,467 --> 00:34:51,200
Sounds good to me.

819
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:53,667
We farmers take our meals
very seriously.

820
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,400
Yeah. I snuck over here
for breakfast

821
00:34:55,533 --> 00:34:57,200
for five years straight.

822
00:34:57,333 --> 00:34:59,033
I can see why.
This is delicious.

823
00:34:59,166 --> 00:35:01,266
What's wrong, Dad?

824
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,233
Uh, there's a delay on the
tasting glasses for the party.

825
00:35:04,367 --> 00:35:06,000
If they don't get there
on time, this event--

826
00:35:06,133 --> 00:35:07,633
Listen.
I'll take care of it, Mike.

827
00:35:07,767 --> 00:35:09,800
You just concentrate
on the wine itself. Don't worry.

828
00:35:09,934 --> 00:35:12,233
It's going to be great, Dad.
I know it.

829
00:35:12,367 --> 00:35:14,467
Really? How do you know that?

830
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,066
Because we're due
for some really good luck.

831
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,800
I will toast to that.

832
00:35:19,934 --> 00:35:21,467
How do we toast, Dad?
Where are the actual drinks?

833
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,734
Hmm.

834
00:35:22,867 --> 00:35:24,333
- On it.
- Oh, can I help?

835
00:35:24,467 --> 00:35:25,767
No.
- No, no. I got it.

836
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:29,467
You and Diane just relax.

837
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,667
Britney is such a sweet kid.

838
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,667
She is,
and she's been through a lot.

839
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,633
Yeah. I heard about her mom.

840
00:35:37,767 --> 00:35:39,567
Do you mind me asking
what happened?

841
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:43,000
Sara had a heart condition
that nobody knew about.

842
00:35:43,133 --> 00:35:45,266
It was just
a one-in-a-million thing.

843
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,667
And Michael said
he made the ice wine for her.

844
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,567
Yeah. They started it together.

845
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,600
When she died, he just wanted to
keep their vision alive.

846
00:35:54,734 --> 00:35:56,900
But now, he's obsessed with it

847
00:35:57,033 --> 00:35:59,600
as a way to bring the winery
back from that review.

848
00:35:59,734 --> 00:36:01,300
He just needs a win.

849
00:36:05,934 --> 00:36:07,800
Seriously, Chrissy,
this isn't cool.

850
00:36:07,934 --> 00:36:09,700
Look. I'm really busy,

851
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,834
and I don't deal well with
the whole passive-aggressive,

852
00:36:11,967 --> 00:36:13,667
silent treatment thing.

853
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,800
We're adults. Just let me know
that you're okay. Okay?

854
00:36:17,934 --> 00:36:19,667
Okay.

855
00:36:21,367 --> 00:36:25,967
That's all that's been
turned in. Any of them yours?

856
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,867
I don't know.

857
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,166
Can we open one of them
just to make sure?

858
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,867
I'd need to see some ID.

859
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,734
No. I lost my purse, too.

860
00:36:33,867 --> 00:36:36,333
I'm sorry, miss. Without ID,
there's not much I can do.

861
00:36:36,467 --> 00:36:39,633
Have you tried
calling the police?

862
00:36:39,767 --> 00:36:40,900
- Yeah.
- Yes.

863
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:43,967
Nothing I can do. Sorry.

864
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,834
Thank you.

865
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,567
Who's this?

866
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,834
That would be one Eleanor Parks.

867
00:36:56,967 --> 00:36:59,133
She's the end-all, be-all
reviewer

868
00:36:59,266 --> 00:37:00,967
of wines in this region.

869
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,900
You get a good review from her,
and everything changes.

870
00:37:04,033 --> 00:37:05,433
Do you know her?

871
00:37:05,567 --> 00:37:07,300
I don't think so.

872
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:08,800
But if she's that important,

873
00:37:08,934 --> 00:37:10,367
I hope she's coming
to your barrel-tapping.

874
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,600
Well, she was invited.

875
00:37:11,734 --> 00:37:13,200
No guarantee she'll show,
though.

876
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:14,800
A lot of competition
for her time this week.

877
00:37:14,934 --> 00:37:16,800
Well, she just needs
to think she's missing

878
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:18,233
the next best thing
if she doesn't.

879
00:37:18,367 --> 00:37:19,934
Well, thank you very much.

880
00:37:20,066 --> 00:37:21,767
So, we've narrowed
down your career

881
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,266
to chef/baker, and apparently
now, marketing executive.

882
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,200
Or fashion designer.

883
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:28,233
Your shoes
when you came here were amazing.

884
00:37:28,367 --> 00:37:30,133
I don't know what I was thinking
wearing those in the snow.

885
00:37:30,266 --> 00:37:31,567
That's what I said.

886
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,934
I think, after all this,

887
00:37:33,066 --> 00:37:35,200
I'm going to stick to
snuggly boots.

888
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:37,033
What?

889
00:37:37,166 --> 00:37:38,533
It's Gene.

890
00:37:38,667 --> 00:37:40,100
He just spoke to
the guy at the phone store.

891
00:37:40,233 --> 00:37:41,467
They can't get your phone
up and running.

892
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,700
Great.

893
00:37:43,834 --> 00:37:46,567
And no one has turned in
your purse from the train.

894
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,100
I'm so sorry, Joy.

895
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:49,800
How can this be?

896
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:53,867
No missing persons report.
Nothing on social media.

897
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,734
Hey, hey.
We could check online.

898
00:37:55,867 --> 00:37:57,533
I don't want you to worry,
all right?

899
00:37:57,667 --> 00:38:00,700
Anything you need, we'll take
care of it. That means anything.

900
00:38:00,834 --> 00:38:02,934
Besides, remember
what the doctor said.

901
00:38:03,066 --> 00:38:05,734
It's not going to last long.
Okay?

902
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,200
I don't know
how to thank you both.

903
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:11,033
I mean, of course, I will pay
you back for everything.

904
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:14,433
Joy, hey. You don't have to
pay us back.

905
00:38:14,567 --> 00:38:16,667
Just pay it forward.

906
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,200
I will,

907
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:22,133
starting with baking something
new from my notebook.

908
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:25,433
Maybe one of
these recipes is the trigger

909
00:38:25,567 --> 00:38:26,967
to remembering who I am,

910
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,800
and maybe one of
them will be good enough

911
00:38:28,934 --> 00:38:31,367
to convince your dad to serve
your ice wine at the party.

912
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,100
Ha. You know how
to bake miracles?

913
00:38:34,233 --> 00:38:35,600
We can try.

914
00:38:35,734 --> 00:38:37,800
I'll need
my trusty assistant, though.

915
00:38:37,934 --> 00:38:39,433
- Are you in?
- I'm so in.

916
00:38:48,133 --> 00:38:49,600
I'll bring them in.
Are you sure?

917
00:38:49,734 --> 00:38:51,433
Ah, ah. Hold on a second.
Don't be fooled.

918
00:38:51,567 --> 00:38:53,633
You're just trying to hide the
fact that you already opened up

919
00:38:53,767 --> 00:38:55,467
the white chocolate chips
and ate half the bag, right?

920
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,767
Actually, that was me.

921
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,033
Whoa! Really?

922
00:39:00,734 --> 00:39:01,934
Well, listen. I'll be right in.

923
00:39:02,066 --> 00:39:03,533
I just got to go
check on the grapes.

924
00:39:03,667 --> 00:39:05,867
Oh. Do you mind if I join you?

925
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,233
Maybe if I can remember our
conversation in the vineyard,

926
00:39:08,367 --> 00:39:09,834
something else will spark.

927
00:39:09,967 --> 00:39:12,900
Sure.

928
00:39:13,033 --> 00:39:15,333
Plus you're pretty good company.

929
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,633
You're not so bad yourself.

930
00:39:20,333 --> 00:39:21,433
After you.

931
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,533
Okay.

932
00:39:25,867 --> 00:39:27,734
So, what happens

933
00:39:27,867 --> 00:39:30,500
if the best night to harvest
is the same night as the party?

934
00:39:30,633 --> 00:39:32,767
Ooh.

935
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,667
Shh. Don't say that.

936
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,600
We don't want to put that
out in the universe.

937
00:39:36,734 --> 00:39:38,934
No. That would be
a total disaster.

938
00:39:39,066 --> 00:39:42,233
You see, when you harvest,
all hands are on deck.

939
00:39:42,367 --> 00:39:44,333
Same thing goes for the party.

940
00:39:44,467 --> 00:39:47,433
Even though I want to create
a buzz with the ice wine,

941
00:39:47,567 --> 00:39:49,667
the party is more important.

942
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,900
We need to make sure everybody
knows we have good wine,

943
00:39:52,033 --> 00:39:53,600
the best wine,

944
00:39:53,734 --> 00:39:56,333
and Dad thinks I'm forgetting
that, but I'm not.

945
00:39:56,467 --> 00:40:00,934
I just-- I just want
to create an edge, you know?

946
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:03,600
No. I think he knows you care,
not just for the wine,

947
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,500
but for everyone around you.

948
00:40:05,633 --> 00:40:07,367
I mean, I've only known you
for a couple of days

949
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,800
and I can see it.

950
00:40:12,967 --> 00:40:14,734
- Ooh.
- What?

951
00:40:14,867 --> 00:40:16,200
Oh.

952
00:40:17,967 --> 00:40:19,166
Ooh.
What do you think?

953
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,700
Five-second rule?

954
00:40:20,834 --> 00:40:23,100
Well, it's frozen.
So, I'll give you a minute.

955
00:40:23,233 --> 00:40:25,367
Good point.

956
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,000
Mmm.

957
00:40:28,133 --> 00:40:30,734
Whoever thought to make
ice wine in the first place?

958
00:40:30,867 --> 00:40:32,867
Ah. Well, now that you ask,

959
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,433
there's a great story
behind that, too.

960
00:40:34,567 --> 00:40:37,233
Um, a frost struck

961
00:40:37,367 --> 00:40:40,233
a small German vineyard
before harvest.

962
00:40:40,367 --> 00:40:41,834
When the villagers woke up,
they realized

963
00:40:41,967 --> 00:40:43,533
they didn't want to
let the grapes go, right?

964
00:40:43,667 --> 00:40:45,367
They're not going to have
anything to sell that year.

965
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,000
So, they said, "You know what?
We're going to take a chance.

966
00:40:47,133 --> 00:40:49,700
"We're going to build
a bonfire. Make streusel.

967
00:40:49,834 --> 00:40:52,033
We're going to harvest anyway."

968
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:54,400
And when they pressed
on those frozen grapes,

969
00:40:54,533 --> 00:40:55,834
they tasted the sweetest wine

970
00:40:55,967 --> 00:40:58,033
that they'd ever had
in their life,

971
00:40:58,166 --> 00:41:01,233
and they decided
to call it ice wine.

972
00:41:01,367 --> 00:41:05,300
I love that. A happy accident.

973
00:41:05,433 --> 00:41:07,934
Also, I just--
I feel like it was something

974
00:41:08,066 --> 00:41:09,500
that was meant to happen,
you know?

975
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,400
The villagers hit a roadblock

976
00:41:11,533 --> 00:41:14,800
and they ended up somewhere
they never thought they'd be.

977
00:41:14,934 --> 00:41:17,667
And it turned out for the best.

978
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,400
Yes, it did.

979
00:41:19,533 --> 00:41:21,633
Well, maybe one day,

980
00:41:21,767 --> 00:41:25,667
I can look back on all this
and say the same thing.

981
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,767
I hope so, too.

982
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,433
For what it's worth,
I just want to say,

983
00:41:30,567 --> 00:41:34,600
I am so glad that you showed up
at the wrong winery.

984
00:41:37,066 --> 00:41:39,266
You know what? I am, too.

985
00:41:42,567 --> 00:41:44,000
Oh.

986
00:41:46,967 --> 00:41:48,600
It's snowing.

987
00:41:48,734 --> 00:41:52,000
This could be a clue
that maybe you live somewhere

988
00:41:52,133 --> 00:41:53,834
that there's not--
There's no snow.

989
00:41:53,967 --> 00:41:55,934
- Maybe.
- Yep.

990
00:41:58,066 --> 00:42:00,200
It's so beautiful.

991
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:03,467
You're living in the moment?

992
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,066
Yeah.

993
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,166
You freaking out?

994
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,633
No.

995
00:42:13,533 --> 00:42:15,266
Good.

996
00:42:22,166 --> 00:42:23,300
It's beautiful, huh?

997
00:42:23,433 --> 00:42:24,734
Yeah.

998
00:42:27,166 --> 00:42:28,567
Then sugar.

999
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,166
Hey.
- Okay. Yeah, yeah.

1000
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,667
What are you guys making?

1001
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,567
We need salt.
Oh, a soufflé from my notebook.

1002
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:36,400
I have a ton of notes around it,
so I must have made it a lot.

1003
00:42:36,533 --> 00:42:38,367
Okay. You got to be
a pastry chef. I mean, come on.

1004
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,800
Isn't making
soufflés really hard?

1005
00:42:39,934 --> 00:42:41,033
How hard can it be?

1006
00:42:41,166 --> 00:42:42,467
But this time,

1007
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,400
we should
really we follow the recipe.

1008
00:42:44,533 --> 00:42:45,667
No, no. Stop.
Dad!

1009
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,300
What?

1010
00:42:47,433 --> 00:42:49,300
Oh, yeah. That's baking
chocolate, right? Mm-hmm.

1011
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:50,900
Yes.
- That's good.

1012
00:42:51,033 --> 00:42:52,967
- It's yummy.
- Oh, really?

1013
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,000
Yeah, it's really good.

1014
00:42:54,133 --> 00:42:55,033
So, Mr. Hollingbrook,

1015
00:42:55,166 --> 00:42:56,066
what would you pair that with?

1016
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,734
This trash can.

1017
00:42:57,867 --> 00:43:01,934
I can't believe you
followed through with that.

1018
00:43:02,066 --> 00:43:03,700
Apparently,
when I commit, I commit.

1019
00:43:03,834 --> 00:43:05,734
Well, that's a good trait
to have in general.

1020
00:43:05,867 --> 00:43:07,033
Oh.

1021
00:43:07,166 --> 00:43:08,400
- Okay. Come on.
- What can I do to help?

1022
00:43:08,533 --> 00:43:09,900
We could use an
extra pair of hands. Yeah.

1023
00:43:10,033 --> 00:43:11,300
Don't need any more of that.
Yeah.

1024
00:43:11,433 --> 00:43:12,600
But you know,
back in the day...

1025
00:43:12,734 --> 00:43:14,200
Uh-oh.

1026
00:43:14,333 --> 00:43:16,033
...when your dad was cool...
Oh, no.

1027
00:43:16,166 --> 00:43:17,767
Dad.
You know?

1028
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,033
- Oh, oh, oh.
- What do you think of that?

1029
00:43:19,166 --> 00:43:20,266
Oh.

1030
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,400
What do you think
of that, huh?

1031
00:43:21,533 --> 00:43:22,467
Oh.

1032
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,467
Okay.

1033
00:43:25,333 --> 00:43:27,033
Sorry.
What have you done?

1034
00:43:27,166 --> 00:43:29,066
Oh.
Oh, no.

1035
00:43:33,533 --> 00:43:34,967
Hey. Be quiet,

1036
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,400
because she's sleeping.

1037
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,266
Did you, uh,
double up on your socks?

1038
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,266
Yes.

1039
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,800
Because last year,
you only had the one pair,

1040
00:43:48,934 --> 00:43:50,367
and you were freezing.

1041
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,900
- What's going on?
- We're harvesting.

1042
00:43:53,033 --> 00:43:55,300
What, the grapes?
Now, in the middle of the night?

1043
00:43:55,433 --> 00:43:58,033
It's 14 degrees.
It's now or never, so--

1044
00:43:58,166 --> 00:43:59,734
Oh.
- Everyone comes out.

1045
00:43:59,867 --> 00:44:02,200
It's fun. Diane brought
some snow gear for you.

1046
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:03,600
- Really?
- If you don't want to come out,

1047
00:44:03,734 --> 00:44:05,133
it's okay.
I mean, if you're sleeping.

1048
00:44:05,266 --> 00:44:06,867
Are you out of your mind?
I wouldn't miss this

1049
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,667
for the world, and you can get
it done before your party.

1050
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,800
- Okay.
- One less thing to worry about.

1051
00:44:11,934 --> 00:44:13,467
For you, I mean.
I mean, I'm still worried

1052
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,834
about pretty much everything.

1053
00:44:14,967 --> 00:44:17,133
Then maybe
this is a nice distraction.

1054
00:44:17,266 --> 00:44:18,767
You put that on.
We will meet you downstairs.

1055
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,867
- Okay.
- All right?

1056
00:44:23,066 --> 00:44:24,433
Mmm.

1057
00:44:24,567 --> 00:44:25,834
Ta-da!
Ah, here we go.

1058
00:44:25,967 --> 00:44:27,200
Hi.

1059
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:32,133
John! You made it.

1060
00:44:32,266 --> 00:44:33,767
About time.
Listen.

1061
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,166
I may not be crazy
about the idea,

1062
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,367
but hey, my name is
on this stuff, so--

1063
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,367
Don't waste any, Gene.

1064
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,000
If any fall,
just put them in there, okay?

1065
00:44:46,133 --> 00:44:48,033
Thanks, brother.

1066
00:44:48,166 --> 00:44:50,433
Whoa. Oh, I see how
this is going to play.

1067
00:44:50,567 --> 00:44:51,834
Oh, I don't know.

1068
00:44:51,967 --> 00:44:53,133
Really?

1069
00:44:53,266 --> 00:44:54,967
Oh, I missed.

1070
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,200
Oh.

1071
00:44:58,333 --> 00:45:00,500
What's that? Oh.

1072
00:45:00,633 --> 00:45:02,533
Go around. Go around.
Go around!

1073
00:45:02,667 --> 00:45:04,767
Attacking the old guy, huh?

1074
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:07,000
Okay, okay.

1075
00:45:07,133 --> 00:45:09,567
Okay. Okay. All right. You win.
You win. You guys win. You win.

1076
00:45:17,667 --> 00:45:19,433
- You got some snow on you.
- Wow.

1077
00:45:19,567 --> 00:45:20,900
- You okay?
- I'm great.

1078
00:45:21,033 --> 00:45:22,200
Okay. Back to work.

1079
00:45:22,333 --> 00:45:23,233
- Hey.
- Hey, I know.

1080
00:45:23,367 --> 00:45:24,600
Start clipping, Pop.

1081
00:45:30,066 --> 00:45:31,300
- Hey.
- So, Britney fall asleep

1082
00:45:31,433 --> 00:45:32,700
before her head hit
the pillow.

1083
00:45:32,834 --> 00:45:35,233
We all need some rest.

1084
00:45:35,367 --> 00:45:37,767
There's only two days left,
and we still have lots to do.

1085
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,300
Hey, Mike, I have extra
linens in the car.

1086
00:45:39,433 --> 00:45:40,567
Want to help me bring them in?

1087
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:41,800
Sure.
Yeah.

1088
00:45:41,934 --> 00:45:44,266
- Hi.
- Hey.

1089
00:46:02,834 --> 00:46:05,100
John, you should really try it.

1090
00:46:05,233 --> 00:46:07,500
I mean, Michael has
worked so hard on this.

1091
00:46:07,633 --> 00:46:09,033
I know.

1092
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:11,500
Then what's stopping you?

1093
00:46:11,633 --> 00:46:15,266
When I took over
the winery from my dad,

1094
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,000
I tried to make ice wine, too.

1095
00:46:17,133 --> 00:46:18,800
Then we had a heatwave.

1096
00:46:18,934 --> 00:46:20,767
Two weeks
of record temperatures.

1097
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:23,033
We lost a quarter
of our grapes.

1098
00:46:23,166 --> 00:46:25,333
Took years to recover.

1099
00:46:25,467 --> 00:46:26,834
Does Michael know that?

1100
00:46:26,967 --> 00:46:28,800
He thinks
it was just a fluke,

1101
00:46:28,934 --> 00:46:30,700
that it couldn't happen
again like that.

1102
00:46:30,834 --> 00:46:34,300
But isn't that true?

1103
00:46:34,433 --> 00:46:36,700
I can't take that chance.

1104
00:46:36,834 --> 00:46:39,367
He already feels
bad enough about the review.

1105
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,033
I can't let him take that hit

1106
00:46:41,166 --> 00:46:43,467
if the ice wine puts
us deeper in the hole.

1107
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,300
I love him too much.

1108
00:46:46,834 --> 00:46:48,533
But if you love him,

1109
00:46:48,667 --> 00:46:51,300
doesn't he deserve a chance
to make things right?

1110
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:53,533
Or maybe even give you
a second chance

1111
00:46:53,667 --> 00:46:55,967
to make the wine
you dreamed of, too?

1112
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,166
John...

1113
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,166
Hey.

1114
00:47:21,567 --> 00:47:25,066
Uh, did something happen?

1115
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,333
Your dad told me
what happened

1116
00:47:26,467 --> 00:47:28,867
when he tried to
make ice wine.

1117
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,700
Now, it makes sense
why he's holding you back.

1118
00:47:30,834 --> 00:47:32,867
He's protecting you.

1119
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,700
He loves you so much.
You know that, right?

1120
00:47:36,834 --> 00:47:38,367
Yeah.
My dad is not really one

1121
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,233
for talking about
his feelings, so--

1122
00:47:40,367 --> 00:47:42,233
Mm-hmm.

1123
00:47:42,367 --> 00:47:44,166
Guess it runs in
the family.

1124
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:51,000
Are there feelings

1125
00:47:51,133 --> 00:47:52,700
you're not talking about?

1126
00:47:55,367 --> 00:47:57,934
Definitely.

1127
00:47:58,967 --> 00:48:00,800
You know, I don't know

1128
00:48:00,934 --> 00:48:03,967
who I am or where I live
or my history,

1129
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,467
but right now,

1130
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:09,600
I feel like I'm where I belong.

1131
00:48:09,734 --> 00:48:13,233
Is that crazy?

1132
00:48:13,367 --> 00:48:14,967
Well, I mean, if you'd have
asked me that a few days ago,

1133
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,233
I probably would've said yes.

1134
00:48:17,867 --> 00:48:19,066
But now?

1135
00:48:21,066 --> 00:48:23,367
No. It's not crazy.

1136
00:48:30,467 --> 00:48:33,500
Um, let's not get ahead
of ourselves, okay?

1137
00:48:33,633 --> 00:48:36,400
Not until you, you know,
know who you are and--

1138
00:48:36,533 --> 00:48:38,433
No. Of course. Of course.

1139
00:48:38,567 --> 00:48:40,467
You need to protect yourself
and Britney.

1140
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,100
And you.

1141
00:48:49,967 --> 00:48:51,233
Hi. It's Kevin.

1142
00:48:51,367 --> 00:48:53,400
Oh. Kevin, this is, uh, Sam,

1143
00:48:53,533 --> 00:48:54,767
Christina's editor.

1144
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,834
Listen.
I really need to talk to her,

1145
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:58,567
but she's not answering
my calls.

1146
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:00,734
What? Really?
Okay. I'll call her mom.

1147
00:49:00,867 --> 00:49:02,600
Let me call you back.

1148
00:49:08,667 --> 00:49:10,000
Phyllis, hey.

1149
00:49:10,133 --> 00:49:11,700
Hey, it's Kevin. Hi.

1150
00:49:11,834 --> 00:49:14,200
I was wondering, um,

1151
00:49:14,333 --> 00:49:16,934
have you heard from Christina
in the last few days?

1152
00:49:41,934 --> 00:49:43,200
Joy?

1153
00:49:43,333 --> 00:49:44,734
- Hey.
- Hi.

1154
00:49:48,133 --> 00:49:49,800
Okay.

1155
00:49:49,934 --> 00:49:51,533
I just wanted to say thanks

1156
00:49:51,667 --> 00:49:54,800
for helping us with the baking
and harvesting last night.

1157
00:49:54,934 --> 00:49:57,300
Dad has been so stressed out
about the party.

1158
00:49:57,433 --> 00:50:01,166
We haven't had that much fun
in a long time.

1159
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,667
It was my pleasure,

1160
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,266
and thank you for making me feel
so at home.

1161
00:50:06,333 --> 00:50:09,300
Oh.

1162
00:50:12,967 --> 00:50:15,100
Your mom has kind eyes,
just like you.

1163
00:50:16,867 --> 00:50:19,033
I'm sure you miss her very much.

1164
00:50:19,166 --> 00:50:20,700
I do.

1165
00:50:20,834 --> 00:50:24,567
But sometimes when I feel happy,
I feel guilty.

1166
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,233
Like last night.

1167
00:50:26,367 --> 00:50:29,233
Brit, I'm sure that when
your mom is watching over you

1168
00:50:29,367 --> 00:50:32,133
from heaven, seeing you smile
makes her heart sing.

1169
00:50:32,266 --> 00:50:35,066
- You really think so?
- I do.

1170
00:50:38,133 --> 00:50:41,033
So, what does it actually feel
like to have amnesia?

1171
00:50:41,166 --> 00:50:43,200
Hmm.

1172
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:44,900
Hey. There you are.

1173
00:50:45,033 --> 00:50:47,333
As a matter of fact,
I just overheard you.

1174
00:50:47,467 --> 00:50:49,900
I was wondering the same thing.

1175
00:50:50,033 --> 00:50:52,467
Okay. Um, well,

1176
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,066
you know that feeling
when you wake up,

1177
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,000
and for a second,
you don't know where you are,

1178
00:50:56,133 --> 00:50:57,967
or if you're still dreaming
or not?

1179
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:59,500
Oh, man. I hate that.

1180
00:50:59,633 --> 00:51:01,367
Then I don't recommend
this experience for you.

1181
00:51:03,066 --> 00:51:04,967
I'm so sorry this happened
to you, Joy.

1182
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:09,200
You know what? I'm not.
Because if it didn't happen,

1183
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:11,200
I wouldn't have met you
and your dad.

1184
00:51:11,333 --> 00:51:14,200
I mean, of course I want to
find out who I am.

1185
00:51:14,333 --> 00:51:17,967
But I think part of me
is really going to miss this.

1186
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,700
Is that weird?

1187
00:51:22,834 --> 00:51:24,800
No. It's not weird at all.

1188
00:51:24,934 --> 00:51:27,033
And just for the record,

1189
00:51:27,166 --> 00:51:29,734
no matter who you are,

1190
00:51:29,867 --> 00:51:31,734
you're always welcome here,
okay?

1191
00:51:33,367 --> 00:51:36,033
Oh. I don't have a dress
for the party tomorrow.

1192
00:51:36,166 --> 00:51:38,433
Oh. Maybe your dad
can take you shopping.

1193
00:51:38,567 --> 00:51:41,033
Yeah.
- Or maybe you could?

1194
00:51:41,166 --> 00:51:45,433
No offense to Dad, but he thinks
"fancy" means dark jeans.

1195
00:51:45,567 --> 00:51:48,266
Now, come on. that's not...

1196
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,567
That's absolutely true, yeah.

1197
00:52:02,333 --> 00:52:05,033
See? I think
you'd look beautiful in that.

1198
00:52:05,166 --> 00:52:07,000
Except I read online
with my colouring,

1199
00:52:07,133 --> 00:52:08,767
I should never wear
this shade of pink.

1200
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:11,700
Pfft. Right now, in this moment,

1201
00:52:11,834 --> 00:52:15,266
this dress makes you happy.

1202
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,700
And that's all that matters.

1203
00:52:17,834 --> 00:52:19,667
Unless, of course,
the dress costs a fortune,

1204
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,667
in which case we should probably
ask your dad,

1205
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,033
because I don't want to
get in trouble.

1206
00:52:23,166 --> 00:52:25,300
It's on sale.

1207
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:27,500
Victory is ours.

1208
00:52:27,633 --> 00:52:30,567
Do you think you'll need a dress
for the party, too?

1209
00:52:31,767 --> 00:52:34,600
I don't know. I mean,

1210
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:37,100
any moment, my memory
could come back, and then--

1211
00:52:37,233 --> 00:52:38,800
Back to your real life?

1212
00:52:38,934 --> 00:52:41,734
I know. Whatever that is.

1213
00:52:43,233 --> 00:52:46,967
But for what it's worth,

1214
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:49,700
I hope it's as nice as this one.

1215
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,200
That's her. Eleanor Parks.

1216
00:53:00,467 --> 00:53:02,433
- From the magazine?
- Yeah.

1217
00:53:03,467 --> 00:53:05,000
Has she RSVP'd to the party yet?

1218
00:53:05,133 --> 00:53:06,834
I don't think so.

1219
00:53:06,967 --> 00:53:08,734
Well, why don't you go
try on the dress,

1220
00:53:08,867 --> 00:53:10,000
and I'll go talk to her?

1221
00:53:10,133 --> 00:53:11,633
- Okay.
- Okay.

1222
00:53:13,333 --> 00:53:15,734
- Uh, excuse me?
- Yes?

1223
00:53:15,867 --> 00:53:18,834
- Hi.
- Oh, hi, Christina.

1224
00:53:20,066 --> 00:53:23,166
You know me?

1225
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,900
You don't have to be
so dramatic.

1226
00:53:26,033 --> 00:53:27,667
Don't worry.
I'm not going to be the one

1227
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,233
to blow C.J. Osborne's cover.

1228
00:53:30,367 --> 00:53:32,333
I wouldn't do that.

1229
00:53:32,467 --> 00:53:34,200
Wait.

1230
00:53:34,333 --> 00:53:36,300
I'm C.J. Osborne?

1231
00:53:40,166 --> 00:53:42,734
I don't know why you're playing
this game, Christina.

1232
00:53:42,867 --> 00:53:44,767
Just don't play it with me.

1233
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:07,667
Well, what did she say?
Is she coming?

1234
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,700
Uh, it wasn't her.

1235
00:54:09,834 --> 00:54:11,600
Oh. Bummer.

1236
00:54:14,633 --> 00:54:16,033
Yeah.

1237
00:54:19,567 --> 00:54:22,300
Hey, you two.
So, I've got good news.

1238
00:54:22,433 --> 00:54:24,266
The flyers are still up
all over town for the party.

1239
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,266
I'm just praying
that Eleanor Parks saw it,

1240
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,934
and that C.J. Osborne did not.

1241
00:54:28,066 --> 00:54:30,367
He wouldn't dare show his face
at our winery, Dad.

1242
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,467
- Don't worry.
- I hope not.

1243
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:33,934
He's literally the last
person I want to see, honey.

1244
00:54:35,467 --> 00:54:37,333
Joy, you okay?

1245
00:54:37,467 --> 00:54:38,934
Joy? Hello?

1246
00:54:39,066 --> 00:54:41,633
Hi. Yes. I'm fine.

1247
00:54:41,767 --> 00:54:44,300
- Everything's fine.
- Okay.

1248
00:54:51,467 --> 00:54:54,266
Okay. Guess she's ready to go.
Hop in, honey.

1249
00:54:58,233 --> 00:55:00,100
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

1250
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:06,066
Hey, Mike, is she okay?

1251
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:09,767
Uh, no.
She wasn't feeling very well.

1252
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:11,533
Listen. I figure if she's not
feeling better soon,

1253
00:55:11,667 --> 00:55:13,867
we should call Dr. Grayson,
okay?

1254
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,767
I'll go check on her.

1255
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:18,600
- Right. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1256
00:55:18,734 --> 00:55:20,467
Let's go take your jacket, okay?

1257
00:55:30,233 --> 00:55:31,633
Joy?

1258
00:55:34,066 --> 00:55:36,734
Michael told me
you weren't feeling well.

1259
00:55:36,867 --> 00:55:38,767
I can tell he's worried.

1260
00:55:40,367 --> 00:55:42,200
You know,
he cares a lot about you.

1261
00:55:43,834 --> 00:55:45,767
I really care about him, too.

1262
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:47,934
And that's what makes this
even worse.

1263
00:55:48,066 --> 00:55:50,834
What's wrong?

1264
00:55:53,367 --> 00:55:54,700
I got my memory back.

1265
00:55:54,834 --> 00:55:57,934
- You got your memory back?
- Shh.

1266
00:55:58,066 --> 00:56:00,166
Why?
That's actually amazing news.

1267
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:01,633
No, it's not.

1268
00:56:01,767 --> 00:56:04,100
Why not?

1269
00:56:04,233 --> 00:56:06,200
Wait. What's your last name?

1270
00:56:09,033 --> 00:56:11,300
Osborne.

1271
00:56:11,433 --> 00:56:13,667
Christina Osborne.

1272
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,266
Christina?

1273
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,834
But you said your name was Joy
before you even fell--

1274
00:56:17,967 --> 00:56:20,100
Joy is my middle name.

1275
00:56:20,233 --> 00:56:22,266
Christina Joy Osborne.

1276
00:56:26,133 --> 00:56:28,333
- No.
- Yes.

1277
00:56:28,467 --> 00:56:31,767
- You're C.J. Osb--
- Shh! Not so loud.

1278
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:33,667
I can't believe it.

1279
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,533
But I don't want to be her.

1280
00:56:36,567 --> 00:56:38,367
Oh, I just want to be Joy again.

1281
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:42,500
Michael is never going to
forgive me.

1282
00:56:42,633 --> 00:56:45,500
- For the review?
- For everything. He hates me.

1283
00:56:45,633 --> 00:56:48,467
And Britney and John and Gene,
they're going to hate me, too.

1284
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,734
And they're right to.
I'm the bad guy.

1285
00:56:50,867 --> 00:56:52,900
- I don't hate you.
- Well, you should.

1286
00:56:53,033 --> 00:56:55,133
I'm the reason the winery
lost so much business.

1287
00:56:55,266 --> 00:56:57,900
I'm the reason everything
is riding on tomorrow night.

1288
00:56:58,033 --> 00:57:00,967
You have to tell them the truth.

1289
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:03,567
How do I explain all this?

1290
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:05,900
How do I tell them
how sorry I am?

1291
00:57:06,033 --> 00:57:08,734
How do I show them--

1292
00:57:08,867 --> 00:57:11,333
How do I show them that I am not

1293
00:57:11,467 --> 00:57:13,533
the same person I was
when I got here?

1294
00:57:13,667 --> 00:57:14,900
Okay. Let's just--

1295
00:57:15,033 --> 00:57:17,066
Let's just take a second
to process this.

1296
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,500
Okay.

1297
00:57:18,633 --> 00:57:20,433
Is there anyone you need
to call?

1298
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,567
You're already with someone,
aren't you?

1299
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:32,433
I was. I mean, I am, but...

1300
00:57:34,467 --> 00:57:37,133
...that's not what I want
anymore.

1301
00:57:37,266 --> 00:57:38,967
What do you want?

1302
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:41,533
I want what Joy had.

1303
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:44,033
She lived in the moment.

1304
00:57:44,166 --> 00:57:46,867
She didn't know what the future
held, and it set her free.

1305
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,233
Diane, she was happy.

1306
00:57:48,367 --> 00:57:50,734
Christina,
you can still have that.

1307
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:52,400
That doesn't have to change.

1308
00:57:52,533 --> 00:57:54,834
Everything is going to change
when I tell them.

1309
00:57:54,967 --> 00:57:56,667
What's this going to do
to Britney?

1310
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,066
She's going to be devastated.

1311
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:02,200
They care about you.
No matter what your name is.

1312
00:58:02,333 --> 00:58:04,867
But you do have to tell them.

1313
00:58:05,934 --> 00:58:07,333
Joy?

1314
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,800
- Uh, give us a second, Mike?
- Sure.

1315
00:58:15,166 --> 00:58:17,900
You have to tell him.

1316
00:58:18,033 --> 00:58:19,533
I will. I will.

1317
00:58:19,667 --> 00:58:21,300
But not until
I make things right.

1318
00:58:21,433 --> 00:58:23,800
That way, maybe they won't
be as angry.

1319
00:58:23,934 --> 00:58:25,934
Maybe they won't hate me.
Maybe Michael--

1320
00:58:26,066 --> 00:58:27,266
I'm not sure
that's such a good idea.

1321
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:28,867
Please, please, Diane.

1322
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,200
Just don't say anything
until the party tomorrow night.

1323
00:58:31,333 --> 00:58:34,567
I have to fix this
for everyone.

1324
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:37,100
I need a phone.
I have a lot of calls to make.

1325
00:58:37,233 --> 00:58:38,900
Here. Use mine for now.

1326
00:58:39,033 --> 00:58:40,967
And I'll, um, I'll bring you to
town to get a new one.

1327
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,633
Oh, thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

1328
00:58:54,667 --> 00:58:57,600
Hey.
Where are you two headed off to?

1329
00:58:57,734 --> 00:59:00,934
Uh, we're just going into town
to get, um--

1330
00:59:01,066 --> 00:59:02,600
Get ingredients
for another dessert.

1331
00:59:02,734 --> 00:59:04,333
Oh. Okay, good.

1332
00:59:04,467 --> 00:59:06,633
So, you're feeling a little more
like yourself, then, huh?

1333
00:59:06,767 --> 00:59:09,133
- Something like that.
- Well, listen.

1334
00:59:09,266 --> 00:59:11,100
I forgot to drop off
some of these shuttle passes

1335
00:59:11,233 --> 00:59:12,934
for the party for the buyers
staying in town.

1336
00:59:13,066 --> 00:59:14,767
I could take you back in.

1337
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:16,300
Yeah.
We could take the convertible.

1338
00:59:16,433 --> 00:59:18,367
But it's freezing outside.

1339
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,300
I know. Trust me?

1340
00:59:20,433 --> 00:59:22,800
- More than anything.
- Good.

1341
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:25,400
- I'll meet you out front.
- Okay.

1342
00:59:31,433 --> 00:59:32,600
Hey.

1343
00:59:32,734 --> 00:59:35,100
So, I've got heat on full blast,

1344
00:59:35,233 --> 00:59:37,834
and who doesn't love hot cocoa?

1345
00:59:37,967 --> 00:59:39,934
So, what do you say? You in?

1346
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,600
I can't think of anything else
I'd rather do.

1347
00:59:43,734 --> 00:59:45,200
Well, aside from getting
your memory back.

1348
00:59:45,333 --> 00:59:48,200
- Hop in.
- Right. Of course.

1349
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:54,300
Listen. I was thinking I'd
take you on a little joyride.

1350
00:59:54,433 --> 00:59:55,867
See what I did there?

1351
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,934
I did. Because I'm Joy.

1352
01:00:00,066 --> 01:00:02,767
- All right.
- I'm so Joy.

1353
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,266

Okay.
I got to ask something here.

1362
01:00:29,033 --> 01:00:31,066
You remember this song?

1363
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:34,066
I-- I heard it in the store
earlier.

1364
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,233
And now I've forgotten it again.

1365
01:00:36,367 --> 01:00:38,734

01:00:56,166 --> 01:00:57,800
Wow.

1371
01:00:57,934 --> 01:01:01,433
There's a lot of competition
out here, huh?

1372
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:03,066
Yeah.

1373
01:01:04,567 --> 01:01:07,734
That's why tomorrow is
very important.

1374
01:01:07,867 --> 01:01:10,467
We need to be the winery
everybody is talking about.

1375
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,200
You will.

1376
01:01:14,834 --> 01:01:16,367
I promise.

1377
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,734
Thank you, but I'm not sure
that's a promise

1378
01:01:19,867 --> 01:01:21,533
anyone can make.

1379
01:01:28,333 --> 01:01:29,467
Michael, um--

1380
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,800
You're right. Sorry.

1381
01:01:31,934 --> 01:01:34,533
No, no.

1382
01:01:34,667 --> 01:01:36,900
Here I am, always telling you
how I can't open up.

1383
01:01:39,367 --> 01:01:41,900
But when you're with someone
you like very much, like you--

1384
01:01:42,033 --> 01:01:45,633
It's hard to keep
those feelings inside, yeah.

1385
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:51,033
No matter how hard I try,
I just--

1386
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:53,200
I can't turn these feelings off
for you.

1387
01:02:04,967 --> 01:02:06,467
Oh, listen.
You can put the baking supplies

1388
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:08,133
on my account, okay?

1389
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:09,934
- Thank you.
- No, no. Don't mention it.

1390
01:02:10,066 --> 01:02:11,633
In the meantime, I'm going to
drop these passes off.

1391
01:02:11,767 --> 01:02:12,967
I'll be back here
in a few minutes.

1392
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:14,200
- Okay.
- All right.

1393
01:02:14,333 --> 01:02:15,867
- All right.
- Good luck.

1394
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,333
Hello?

1395
01:02:30,467 --> 01:02:32,166
- Mom, Mom, it's me.
- Christina!

1396
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:33,600
Where have you been?

1397
01:02:33,734 --> 01:02:35,333
Everyone's been trying
to reach you.

1398
01:02:35,467 --> 01:02:39,633
I know, I know.
It's a long story. Listen.

1399
01:02:39,767 --> 01:02:41,200
Hey, um, I'm trying to find out

1400
01:02:41,333 --> 01:02:43,600
if a Christina Osbourne
checked in?

1401
01:02:47,066 --> 01:02:48,200
Hey.

1402
01:02:48,333 --> 01:02:50,200
It could be under C.J. Osborne.

1403
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:51,967
Uh, sorry to interrupt,

1404
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:53,834
did you just say C.J. Osborne?

1405
01:02:53,967 --> 01:02:55,767
As in the food critic?

1406
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:58,300
Yeah. I'm her boyfriend.

1407
01:02:58,433 --> 01:03:03,000
Oh. Wow.
I had no idea C.J. Osborne

1408
01:03:03,133 --> 01:03:04,533
was a woman.

1409
01:03:04,667 --> 01:03:05,834
Yeah. Well, that's by design.

1410
01:03:05,967 --> 01:03:07,834
She likes to keep people
guessing.

1411
01:03:07,967 --> 01:03:10,000
Do you know her?

1412
01:03:10,133 --> 01:03:12,033
Do I know her?

1413
01:03:12,166 --> 01:03:15,200
Yeah.
I run, um, Hollingbrook Winery.

1414
01:03:17,066 --> 01:03:18,433
Oh, man.

1415
01:03:18,567 --> 01:03:20,500
- The merlot.
- Yeah. That'd be the one.

1416
01:03:20,633 --> 01:03:22,066
Hmm.

1417
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,200
Listen. If you could do me
the hugest favor,

1418
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:26,600
just steer her away from
Hollingbrook Winery this week.

1419
01:03:26,734 --> 01:03:28,233
I'd really appreciate it.

1420
01:03:28,367 --> 01:03:29,867
You know, just in case
she's planning on another

1421
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,100
- follow-up hit piece.
- Totally understand.

1422
01:03:32,233 --> 01:03:34,233
- Will do.
- Okay, great. Thanks.

1423
01:03:34,367 --> 01:03:35,767
Appreciate it.

1424
01:03:37,367 --> 01:03:39,600
Of course,
I just have to find her first.

1425
01:03:39,734 --> 01:03:43,200
Just meet me at the B&B tomorrow
morning at 9:00, please?

1426
01:03:43,333 --> 01:03:45,500
I really need to talk to you.

1427
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:50,266
Mom, did you talk to Sam?
Great.

1428
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,567
Thank you so much.

1429
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:56,367
Yeah. I hope it works too.

1430
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,200
Yeah.

1431
01:03:58,333 --> 01:04:00,166
Mom, I have to go. I love you.

1432
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,500
- Hey.
- Hey.

1433
01:04:04,633 --> 01:04:07,767
Listen. I was thinking we should
check on your phone at the shop.

1434
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:10,600
You know what? I already did.
And, um, yeah.

1435
01:04:10,734 --> 01:04:13,934
The guy said he's this close
to fixing it. Probably tomorrow.

1436
01:04:14,066 --> 01:04:15,767
He practically guaranteed it.

1437
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:17,567
- Oh, good. Tomorrow, then.
- Tomorrow.

1438
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:19,633
Well, then, that means you and I
need to make the most of today.

1439
01:04:19,767 --> 01:04:23,233
Look at you.
Living in the moment.

1440
01:04:23,367 --> 01:04:25,166
Ah, I like it.
It's my new thing.

1441
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:29,000
Mine, too. Really, really new.

1442
01:04:29,133 --> 01:04:32,000
Because you never know when
everything is going to change.

1443
01:04:32,133 --> 01:04:34,333
Well, I can tell you one thing.

1444
01:04:34,467 --> 01:04:36,834
I wouldn't change the last three
days for anything.

1445
01:04:37,867 --> 01:04:39,266
Me, neither.

1446
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:44,934
What? What's wrong?

1447
01:04:45,066 --> 01:04:46,667
Oh, nothing. I just--

1448
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,667
Aren't you supposed to get
some ingredients for a dessert?

1449
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:52,834
Oh, yes. Yeah.
I still need to do that.

1450
01:04:52,967 --> 01:04:54,900
- Let me help you.
- Okay.

1451
01:04:55,033 --> 01:04:56,433
Come on.

1452
01:04:58,467 --> 01:05:01,166
By the way, you're never going
to believe who I ran into

1453
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:03,400
- at the B&B.
- Who?

1454
01:05:03,533 --> 01:05:07,300
C.J. Osborne's boyfriend.

1455
01:05:07,433 --> 01:05:10,667
Wait. Um, he's here?

1456
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:13,800
Yeah. Well, C.J. is a woman.

1457
01:05:13,934 --> 01:05:15,834
Apparently she's a real piece
of work, too.

1458
01:05:15,967 --> 01:05:17,800
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

1459
01:05:17,934 --> 01:05:20,166
Bet she can't wait to ruin
another winery's sales

1460
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:22,000
for the year.

1461
01:05:22,133 --> 01:05:24,367
Michael, I'm sure
if she knew the damage it did,

1462
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,166
she would do anything
to make it right.

1463
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:28,133
It's too late for that.

1464
01:05:30,166 --> 01:05:31,633
What?

1465
01:05:31,767 --> 01:05:34,400
You okay? What's wrong?

1466
01:05:34,533 --> 01:05:36,033
Michael--

1467
01:05:36,166 --> 01:05:37,500
What? I was just saying, I--

1468
01:05:37,633 --> 01:05:39,667
Christina? Hey.

1469
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,166
Kevin.

1470
01:05:44,967 --> 01:05:46,467
Uh, okay.

1471
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:48,367
I guess now I know why
you haven't been

1472
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:50,033
- returning anyone's calls.
- No, no, Kevin.

1473
01:05:50,166 --> 01:05:51,633
There is a good reason for that.

1474
01:05:51,767 --> 01:05:54,133
I'm sorry, did you--
I'm sorry. You know him?

1475
01:05:56,133 --> 01:05:57,633
She's my girlfriend.

1476
01:05:57,767 --> 01:05:59,467
I-- Okay, I'm confused.

1477
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:01,900
I thought you told me that C.J.
Osborne was your girlfriend.

1478
01:06:06,934 --> 01:06:08,367
- Oh.
- Michael.

1479
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:09,900
You know what? I have to go.

1480
01:06:10,033 --> 01:06:12,100
No, Michael. Michael, just wait.

1481
01:06:12,233 --> 01:06:13,600
What exactly is going on?

1482
01:06:13,734 --> 01:06:15,300
Look. I fell and I hit my head,

1483
01:06:15,433 --> 01:06:18,567
and I didn't even know who I was
until earlier today.

1484
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:21,300
Come on. You're going to pretend
that you had amnesia

1485
01:06:21,433 --> 01:06:23,800
this whole time?
I mean, how gullible do I look?

1486
01:06:23,934 --> 01:06:26,300
Look. I know it sounds crazy,
but it's true.

1487
01:06:26,433 --> 01:06:28,100
The Hollingbrooks,
they looked after me.

1488
01:06:28,233 --> 01:06:30,033
Please, just give me
two minutes, okay?

1489
01:06:30,166 --> 01:06:31,934
Your mom
and Sam are worried sick.

1490
01:06:32,066 --> 01:06:33,533
I called my mom
and she called Sam.

1491
01:06:33,667 --> 01:06:35,033
What, you just didn't bother
calling me?

1492
01:06:35,166 --> 01:06:37,133
No, I tried.
Please, two minutes,

1493
01:06:37,266 --> 01:06:40,166
and then we can talk, I promise.
Just two minutes. Michael!

1494
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:47,633
- Michael.
- No, listen.

1495
01:06:47,767 --> 01:06:49,433
You know, I can't believe after
all the conversations

1496
01:06:49,567 --> 01:06:52,900
we had together about
how awful that review was,

1497
01:06:53,033 --> 01:06:56,000
- it was you this whole time.
- I am so sorry.

1498
01:06:56,133 --> 01:06:57,734
I was wrong to write
that review,

1499
01:06:57,867 --> 01:07:00,300
and even more wrong
not to give you a second chance,

1500
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:04,567
but I'm just not that person.
Not anymore.

1501
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:06,400
Really?
Well, let me ask you a question.

1502
01:07:06,533 --> 01:07:09,400
When you first got here, before
you fell and hit your head,

1503
01:07:09,533 --> 01:07:11,000
you told me your name was Joy.

1504
01:07:11,133 --> 01:07:12,467
I did.

1505
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:14,066
Were you here doing
an anonymous review?

1506
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:17,567
No. No. I just didn't want to
make a scene.

1507
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,200
- Oh.
- There was a mix-up

1508
01:07:19,333 --> 01:07:21,667
at the train station,
and when I realized where I was,

1509
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,967
I was trying to leave,
and that's when I fell.

1510
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:26,467
Michael, if I had known then
what I know now,

1511
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:28,734
everything would be different.

1512
01:07:28,867 --> 01:07:31,667
Doesn't matter anymore,
does it?

1513
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:33,367
I mean, come on. Look.
You got your memory back.

1514
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:35,467
That's all that matters, right?

1515
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:40,734
I just can't believe you knew
who you were this whole time,

1516
01:07:40,867 --> 01:07:42,834
and you waited this long
to tell me.

1517
01:07:42,967 --> 01:07:46,166
I only waited because I wanted
to make things right.

1518
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:49,200
- To fix what I broke.
- Well, don't try to fix it,

1519
01:07:49,333 --> 01:07:51,400
because there are some things
that aren't fixable.

1520
01:08:01,233 --> 01:08:02,633
Michael!

1521
01:08:14,066 --> 01:08:16,533
She felt terrible when
she realized who she was, Mike.

1522
01:08:16,667 --> 01:08:19,133
Yeah. Well, I just can't believe
you found out before I did.

1523
01:08:19,266 --> 01:08:22,233
She just wanted to fix things
before she told you.

1524
01:08:22,367 --> 01:08:25,266
You always said that
C.J. Osborne wouldn't give you

1525
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:27,967
a second chance. You're not
going to give her one?

1526
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:30,700
Diane, come on.

1527
01:08:30,834 --> 01:08:32,533
I can't.

1528
01:08:32,667 --> 01:08:35,767
She cares a lot about you.
You two had something special.

1529
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:38,734
Are you really going to
let that go?

1530
01:08:38,867 --> 01:08:41,200
Do you think
I have much of a choice?

1531
01:08:41,333 --> 01:08:43,467
Joy--
I mean, Christina is here.

1532
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,000
She wants to say thanks to all
of us before she leaves.

1533
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,800
Why don't you guys go ahead
and do that?

1534
01:08:53,233 --> 01:08:55,033
'Cause I have work to do.

1535
01:08:57,900 --> 01:08:59,300
Give me one sec.

1536
01:09:05,467 --> 01:09:07,800
I'm so sorry my review
caused you so much pain.

1537
01:09:07,934 --> 01:09:10,500
You were just doing your job.

1538
01:09:10,633 --> 01:09:13,433
I don't even know if I want to
do that job.

1539
01:09:13,567 --> 01:09:17,367
It just doesn't feel like me
anymore.

1540
01:09:18,567 --> 01:09:21,367
You and Michael and Britney,

1541
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:24,500
and you, Diane,

1542
01:09:24,633 --> 01:09:25,967
you changed my life.

1543
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:28,700
For a while there,
you changed ours, too.

1544
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,433
I tried the ice wine.

1545
01:09:32,734 --> 01:09:36,100
You were right.
It deserves a shot.

1546
01:09:36,233 --> 01:09:37,700
Did you tell Michael?

1547
01:09:37,834 --> 01:09:41,500
- Not yet.
- Don't wait. Trust me.

1548
01:09:41,633 --> 01:09:42,934
It only gets harder.

1549
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,533
I just wish I could stay
and fix everything.

1550
01:09:46,667 --> 01:09:48,900
Christina, you fixed more
than you know.

1551
01:09:50,166 --> 01:09:51,433
John.

1552
01:09:52,567 --> 01:09:54,367
It's okay. It's okay.

1553
01:09:56,133 --> 01:09:57,300
Thank you.

1554
01:09:57,433 --> 01:09:59,233
Thank you for all the clothes.

1555
01:10:01,266 --> 01:10:03,300
I guess I have to go.

1556
01:10:03,433 --> 01:10:04,600
Take care.

1557
01:10:04,734 --> 01:10:06,133
You, too.

1558
01:10:32,967 --> 01:10:35,633
You know,

1559
01:10:35,767 --> 01:10:37,700
you didn't say much
on the way back.

1560
01:10:37,834 --> 01:10:40,300
Yeah. It's, um--

1561
01:10:40,433 --> 01:10:42,500
It's been a long few days.

1562
01:10:42,633 --> 01:10:45,100
That's an understatement.

1563
01:10:45,233 --> 01:10:46,767
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1564
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:58,100
Excuse me. What wine is this?

1565
01:11:00,567 --> 01:11:02,400
It's the merlot
from Hollingbrook Winery.

1566
01:11:02,533 --> 01:11:04,200
Excuse me.
Could you just take that back

1567
01:11:04,333 --> 01:11:05,433
and bring something else,
please?

1568
01:11:05,567 --> 01:11:08,266
No, no. It's okay.

1569
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,266
It's wonderful.

1570
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:13,133
Really? That's the wine
you reviewed.

1571
01:11:14,734 --> 01:11:17,567
I should have given them
a second chance.

1572
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:20,700
You've never been big
on second chances, Christina.

1573
01:11:20,834 --> 01:11:25,600
No, I haven't,
but they deserved one.

1574
01:11:25,734 --> 01:11:29,333
Anyone who opens a restaurant
or a winery deserves one.

1575
01:11:29,467 --> 01:11:31,200
They're the ones taking
the risk.

1576
01:11:31,333 --> 01:11:33,500
They're the ones putting their
hearts and souls out there

1577
01:11:33,633 --> 01:11:35,166
with no safety net.

1578
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:37,700
And they have no idea
how it's going to turn out.

1579
01:11:37,834 --> 01:11:40,200
Do you know how brave that is?

1580
01:11:41,834 --> 01:11:44,433
Are we still talking about
restaurants?

1581
01:11:48,967 --> 01:11:51,500
I'm talking about my whole life.

1582
01:11:51,633 --> 01:11:55,266
For as long as I can remember,
nothing scared me more

1583
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:57,767
than not knowing how something
was going to turn out.

1584
01:11:57,900 --> 01:12:01,767
I was terrified of making
the wrong choice

1585
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:06,567
or taking the wrong path,
but what I've realized is

1586
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:09,767
that's not really living at all.

1587
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:14,700
And I don't want to do that
anymore.

1588
01:12:17,467 --> 01:12:20,100
So, what are you saying?

1589
01:12:20,233 --> 01:12:23,667
What I'm saying is

1590
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,934
we've both been running on fumes
for a long time.

1591
01:12:27,066 --> 01:12:28,233
You know that.

1592
01:12:28,367 --> 01:12:33,166
I guess I thought that
eventually

1593
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:35,767
we'd figure out
where we wanted to go.

1594
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:39,333
Maybe it's time we each get in
our own car,

1595
01:12:39,467 --> 01:12:41,100
get a full tank of gas,

1596
01:12:41,233 --> 01:12:45,066
and see where the road takes us.

1597
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:52,400
Maybe you're right.

1598
01:12:56,033 --> 01:12:58,066
Are you sure you're okay?

1599
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:00,834
'Cause this is not
the Christina I know.

1600
01:13:00,967 --> 01:13:03,533
It's the Christina
I used to be.

1601
01:13:03,667 --> 01:13:06,367
It just took getting amnesia
to remember it.

1602
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,967
That's pretty ironic.

1603
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:19,667
So, what are you going
to do now?

1604
01:13:21,367 --> 01:13:24,867
First, I'm going to check
into my room.

1605
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,200
And then tomorrow,

1606
01:13:28,333 --> 01:13:30,633
get back to making things right.

1607
01:13:38,667 --> 01:13:40,600
You got my message?

1608
01:13:43,633 --> 01:13:45,133
- I did.
- Okay.

1609
01:13:50,333 --> 01:13:51,934
Thanks again
for letting me use your kitchen.

1610
01:13:52,066 --> 01:13:53,834
I'm just happy you didn't back
out of your plan

1611
01:13:53,967 --> 01:13:55,500
after Michael told you to leave.

1612
01:13:55,633 --> 01:13:57,200
Oh, no. I'm never giving up.

1613
01:13:57,333 --> 01:13:59,533
Not on Michael,
not on the winery.

1614
01:13:59,667 --> 01:14:01,667
Not until I make things right.

1615
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:04,667
Oh, I talked to John.
He's still on board.

1616
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,467
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1617
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,767
But I have to say,

1618
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:11,567
baking without Britney
just isn't the same.

1619
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:15,400
I know.

1620
01:14:15,533 --> 01:14:17,667
That's why I invited her
to come over.

1621
01:14:25,266 --> 01:14:27,600
It's going to be so weird
not calling you Joy anymore.

1622
01:14:27,734 --> 01:14:29,333
It's actually my middle name.

1623
01:14:29,467 --> 01:14:31,133
But you know, to be honest,
I used to hate it.

1624
01:14:31,266 --> 01:14:34,767
- Why?
- It just didn't feel like me.

1625
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:37,734
But now it does.

1626
01:14:39,633 --> 01:14:41,100
- Can you get the oven for me?
- Yeah.

1627
01:14:41,233 --> 01:14:43,200
All right. Here we go.

1628
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:49,700
Okay.

1629
01:14:50,934 --> 01:14:52,734
Ooh. Those look good.

1630
01:14:55,433 --> 01:14:58,166
Wait. It worked.

1631
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:00,734
This is probably the 20th time
I've tried to make this,

1632
01:15:00,867 --> 01:15:03,367
and the first time
I got it right.

1633
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,133
So, what changed?

1634
01:15:05,266 --> 01:15:07,333
I guess this time
I just went with my gut,

1635
01:15:07,467 --> 01:15:10,200
and I knew that
even if I made a mistake,

1636
01:15:10,333 --> 01:15:12,033
it would still be okay.

1637
01:15:12,166 --> 01:15:14,166
But I'm not done yet.

1638
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:17,000
There is one more recipe
I want to try.

1639
01:15:17,133 --> 01:15:19,400
The one I used to make
with my dad when I was a kid.

1640
01:15:19,533 --> 01:15:21,333
There was nothing sweeter.

1641
01:15:22,967 --> 01:15:24,233
Hey.

1642
01:15:24,367 --> 01:15:26,900
Hey, uh...

1643
01:15:27,033 --> 01:15:28,734
...why are you taking
the sign away?

1644
01:15:28,867 --> 01:15:31,467
Because you were right, Dad.

1645
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:33,667
I need to start thinking about
what's best for the future

1646
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:35,567
of the winery instead of
always thinking about myself.

1647
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:37,967
And I know you were always just
trying to protect me.

1648
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:41,900
Except I was wrong.

1649
01:15:42,033 --> 01:15:45,400
After talking to Christina,
I tried the wine.

1650
01:15:45,533 --> 01:15:49,200
And you're right. It is special.

1651
01:15:49,333 --> 01:15:52,567
It deserves a chance to shine.

1652
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:55,233
Thanks, Dad.

1653
01:15:55,367 --> 01:15:57,233
You know, uh,

1654
01:15:57,367 --> 01:15:59,800
Christina is pretty special,
too.

1655
01:15:59,934 --> 01:16:02,934
I know you've forgiven yourself
for the bad corks.

1656
01:16:03,066 --> 01:16:05,700
Can't you forgive her
for the review?

1657
01:16:07,333 --> 01:16:10,800
- I have.
- Does she know that?

1658
01:16:12,233 --> 01:16:16,600
Dad, no. Come on. I didn't--

1659
01:16:16,734 --> 01:16:19,300
I was so hurt
when I found out who she was,

1660
01:16:19,433 --> 01:16:22,233
I just pushed her away.

1661
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:27,233
Now, she's gone. So--

1662
01:16:27,367 --> 01:16:29,033
Are you sure about that?

1663
01:16:35,667 --> 01:16:37,300
What are you doing here?

1664
01:16:37,433 --> 01:16:39,800
Did you really think I'd let you
serve that incredible wine

1665
01:16:39,934 --> 01:16:42,133
without something
to pair it with?

1666
01:16:42,266 --> 01:16:43,600
Hey, plenty of time to talk
later.

1667
01:16:43,734 --> 01:16:45,433
It's almost time
for the doors to open.

1668
01:16:45,567 --> 01:16:47,066
We have work to do.

1669
01:16:48,533 --> 01:16:50,633
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on. What was that?

1670
01:16:50,767 --> 01:16:52,166
You'll see.

1671
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:54,834
I'll see?

1672
01:17:00,433 --> 01:17:01,633
I see you found your luggage.

1673
01:17:01,767 --> 01:17:03,967
I did,
but every pair of shoes I had

1674
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:06,133
were their own special form
of torture,

1675
01:17:06,266 --> 01:17:09,200
so I made one Diane-inspired
purchase in town.

1676
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:14,767
- I love it. Cheers.
- Cheers.

1677
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:16,100
It looks great, by the way.

1678
01:17:16,233 --> 01:17:17,500
Thanks.

1679
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:19,300
So, it doesn't look like
Eleanor Park showed up.

1680
01:17:19,433 --> 01:17:21,967
That's okay, because everybody
is loving the wine.

1681
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:24,133
We just need some good
old-fashioned word of mouth.

1682
01:17:24,266 --> 01:17:26,000
Wait. She's not here?

1683
01:17:26,133 --> 01:17:28,333
Well, I didn't expect her.

1684
01:17:28,467 --> 01:17:30,333
I did.

1685
01:17:30,467 --> 01:17:32,066
What do you mean
you expected-- Why?

1686
01:17:35,767 --> 01:17:38,633
Oh, there she is. She's here.

1687
01:17:38,767 --> 01:17:40,967
- Excuse me.
- Get a glass of wine. Yeah.

1688
01:17:42,834 --> 01:17:45,033
- Eleanor is here.
- Oh.

1689
01:17:47,066 --> 01:17:49,000
John's time to shine.

1690
01:17:49,133 --> 01:17:52,333
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for coming

1691
01:17:52,467 --> 01:17:54,533
to Hollingbrook Winery tonight.

1692
01:17:54,667 --> 01:17:56,333
We have something new for you.

1693
01:17:56,467 --> 01:18:00,266
It's the first vintage ice wine
this valley has seen

1694
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:01,867
in 50 years.

1695
01:18:06,233 --> 01:18:07,367
Thank you, thank you.

1696
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:09,900
Later, you'll all get a chance

1697
01:18:10,033 --> 01:18:12,734
to visit our custom-made
ice wine room.

1698
01:18:12,867 --> 01:18:15,867
But for the moment, we're going
to take you back in time

1699
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,734
to the German village

1700
01:18:17,867 --> 01:18:21,533
where eiswein was created.

1701
01:18:21,667 --> 01:18:26,100
So, bundle up, everyone,
and follow me.

1702
01:18:28,867 --> 01:18:31,333
Hey, hey, did you do this?
Did you do this for me?

1703
01:18:31,467 --> 01:18:34,100
No, Christina did. For you.

1704
01:18:34,233 --> 01:18:36,633
I just gave her the thumbs up.

1705
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:57,333
It's a pleasure to meet you
in person, thank you.

1706
01:18:57,467 --> 01:18:58,900
- Really lovely.
- Take care of her, okay?

1707
01:18:59,033 --> 01:19:00,734
We need her.

1708
01:19:03,734 --> 01:19:05,233
Christina...

1709
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:08,300
...can I talk to you?

1710
01:19:08,433 --> 01:19:10,400
I thought you'd never ask.

1711
01:19:16,233 --> 01:19:17,400
- Whoa!
- Whoa, whoa.

1712
01:19:17,533 --> 01:19:19,834
Hey, come on. You're scaring me.

1713
01:19:19,967 --> 01:19:22,500
Careful. I don't want you
to fall again.

1714
01:19:22,633 --> 01:19:25,633
I did fall pretty hard.

1715
01:19:25,767 --> 01:19:27,233
So did I.

1716
01:19:31,967 --> 01:19:35,667
I cannot believe that you did
all of this for us.

1717
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:38,500
I just hope it was enough.

1718
01:19:38,633 --> 01:19:40,066
It's more than enough.

1719
01:19:42,033 --> 01:19:45,500
You know, my dad was speaking
earlier to Eleanor Parks.

1720
01:19:45,633 --> 01:19:47,800
And she said she's naming us
Best Overall Winery

1721
01:19:47,934 --> 01:19:49,333
in next month's
Wine and Spirits.

1722
01:19:49,467 --> 01:19:50,834
Really?

1723
01:19:50,967 --> 01:19:52,667
And word apparently
got around the bonfire

1724
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:56,500
that now I have enough advance
orders for the entire year.

1725
01:19:56,633 --> 01:19:58,600
Oh!

1726
01:19:58,734 --> 01:20:00,400
I knew you could do it.

1727
01:20:00,533 --> 01:20:02,166
Oh, I'm so happy for you.

1728
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:04,166
Well, I did have a lot of help.

1729
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:06,233
Well, that streusel
is pretty good.

1730
01:20:06,367 --> 01:20:08,333
Yes. Very, very good.

1731
01:20:08,467 --> 01:20:11,266
But I had a lot of help
in getting Eleanor Parks here.

1732
01:20:13,133 --> 01:20:14,433
- Really?
- Yeah.

1733
01:20:14,567 --> 01:20:16,567
And I asked her.
I said, you know,

1734
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:18,066
"What made you come out
tonight?"

1735
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:19,600
She says, "Well, you know,
it's interesting.

1736
01:20:19,734 --> 01:20:22,800
"I read this inspiring
review online.

1737
01:20:22,934 --> 01:20:26,400
A review that was written
by my former writing partner."

1738
01:20:28,433 --> 01:20:31,834
I couldn't think of a better way
for C.J. to say goodbye.

1739
01:20:31,967 --> 01:20:33,700
I hope it wasn't because of me.

1740
01:20:35,367 --> 01:20:38,433
I'm sorry for all the things
I said about her-- You.

1741
01:20:38,567 --> 01:20:42,100
And the tainted wine
was my mistake.

1742
01:20:42,233 --> 01:20:44,266
And mine was not giving you
a second chance.

1743
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,000
But it doesn't matter.

1744
01:20:46,133 --> 01:20:49,934
Writing reviews is just not
something I want to do anymore.

1745
01:20:50,066 --> 01:20:52,166
I thought that
maybe I could become

1746
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:53,900
a restaurant consultant.

1747
01:20:54,033 --> 01:20:56,333
But instead of just telling
people their problems

1748
01:20:56,467 --> 01:20:59,266
and walking away,
I could also help get them

1749
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:02,200
- on the right track.
- Hmm.

1750
01:21:02,333 --> 01:21:05,667
That sounds like something C.J.
Osborne would be perfect at.

1751
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:12,467
You know, now that
you mention it, I-- Ooh.

1752
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:14,967
- I do have a problem.
- What?

1753
01:21:17,934 --> 01:21:19,734
I want to kiss you so bad.

1754
01:21:25,834 --> 01:21:27,300
Problem solved.

1755
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,467
Now, the problem is solved.

1756
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:40,200
Now, the problem is solved.

1757
01:21:40,333 --> 01:21:42,133
- Oh, by the way...
- Uh-huh?

1758
01:21:42,266 --> 01:21:45,066
- I tried the merlot again.
- Oh. And?

1759
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:47,000
Best I've ever had.

1760
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:50,000
Yes!

1761
01:21:50,133 --> 01:21:51,667
Woo! Did you hear that?
