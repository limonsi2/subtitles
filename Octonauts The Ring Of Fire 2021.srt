00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:33,125
What a beautiful day!

4
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:36,583
Yeah, you know what'd be really beautiful?
Some breakfast.

5
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:39,666
Hey, why don't you
find us breakfast for a change?

6
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,791
Oh yeah? Maybe I will.

7
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,750
I'd like to see that.

8
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:46,333
Yeah, you could
if you'd get out of my way.

9
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:50,458
-Get out of your way? I'm under your way!
-Yeah, you're always under my way.

10
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:52,833
That's because
you follow me wherever I go.

11
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:54,875
I can't help it. I'm kind of fixed to you.

12
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:57,375
Why do you always have to be so prickly?

13
00:00:58,333 --> 00:00:59,458
-You finished?
-No.

14
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:17,333
I got it.

15
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:20,333
Oopsie.

16
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:30,166
I gotcha. Here you go.

17
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:39,166
One, two, three, four.

18
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,166
One, two, three, four.

19
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,125
One, two, three, four.

20
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:44,250
One, two…

21
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:36,791
Attention, Octonauts.
Please report to HQ for roll call.

22
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:06,666
<i>The Octonauts and the Ring of Fire.</i>

23
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,708
Calling all Octonauts.

24
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:12,958
-Kwazii!
<i>-</i>Peso!

25
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:14,166
-Shellington!
-Inkling!

26
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,541
-Dashi!
-Tweak!

27
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:20,458
Tunip!

28
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:24,166
Good morning, Octonauts.
I hope you all had a good night's sleep.

29
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,666
Aye, Captain,
but I had the weirdest dream.

30
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,125
I dreamt that I went to the kitchen
and ate 17 kelp cakes.

31
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,666
Actually, maybe that wasn't a dream.

32
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:39,208
Tunip says that soon we'll have
more kelp cakes than ever,

33
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:41,583
thanks to the Vegimals'
sustainable seaweed farm.

34
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:46,875
A seaweed farm will provide
lots of delicious seaweed for us to eat,

35
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:50,375
and it's a home
for all kinds of sea creatures.

36
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,625
Yes, the seaweed harvest starts today.

37
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:55,958
Well done, Tunip.

38
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,500
Sounds like the seaweed farm
has been a big success.

39
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,833
-Super!
-Any other updates?

40
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:03,916
Shellington and I have one, Captain.
Listen.

41
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:08,041
<i>Welcome back</i>
<i>to the Octonauts video training series.</i>

42
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:11,125
<i>Lesson 27: Basic accordion tips.</i>

43
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:14,791
<i>Playing the accordion is</i>
<i>a lot easier than it seems.</i>

44
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:17,666
Dashi?

45
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:22,958
Whoops. Wrong file. I've been organizing
all the old Octonauts training videos.

46
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:26,583
This is what
we really wanted you to listen to.

47
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:32,333
What are we listening to, matey?
A singing sea banshee?

48
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:36,333
Even better.
This is a recording of an Omura's whale.

49
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:37,875
A whatter's whale?

50
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,791
An Omura's whale.

51
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:44,875
They're one of the rarest whales on Earth.
We've been trying to find one for years.

52
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:49,375
One of our Octo-recorders in the South
Pacific picked up these sounds last night.

53
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:53,166
So today, Shellington and I are going
to look for the whale that made them.

54
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,166
I'd love to get a picture of it.

55
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:59,708
It sounds like you're on the right track.
Good luck with the search.

56
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,708
I'm going somewhere today too.

57
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:05,375
These are my cousins,
the chinstrap penguins.

58
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,833
More penguin cousins?
How many have you got, matey?

59
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:16,500
A lot. And these cousins live here,
on the Sandwich Islands near Antarctica.

60
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:19,625
The chinstrap penguins are
in the middle of their egg-laying season.

61
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,916
Captain Barnacles,
Professor Inkling, and I

62
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,916
are going down there to check up on them.

63
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,625
Anyone's welcome to come along. Kwazii?

64
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:29,791
Thanks, Captain,
but I've got big plans for the day too.

65
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:34,750
I'm taking the GUP-B out for a
little high-speed action on the high seas.

66
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,333
I mean, I've got to make sure
the old engine's working fine and all.

67
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,291
Funny you should mention that, Kwazii.

68
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:48,041
As a matter of fact, I'll be checking
on all the GUPs' engines today.

69
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,791
Huh? What do you mean?

70
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:54,541
What I mean is, I'm taking all the GUPs
back to the Octo-repair station

71
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,166
for a full tune-up.

72
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,416
But we'll need a GUP
to check on the chinstrap penguins.

73
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,375
And we'll need a GUP
to search for the Omura's whale.

74
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,666
We need a GUP for the seaweed harvest.

75
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:08,250
And Tunip says
he needs a GUP for the seaweed harvest.

76
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:12,125
And I need my GUP
to drive around really fast in.

77
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:16,625
Calm down. Tweak already has a solution.

78
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,000
I sure do.

79
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,916
Come on down to the launch bay
and I'll show you.

80
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:35,166
Everybody, I give you the Z-GUPs.

81
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,000
Z-GUPs!

82
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,291
-Wow!
-Oh wow!

83
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:44,083
The Z-One, the Z-Two,
the Z-Three, the Z-Four, and…

84
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:45,291
The Z-Five!

85
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:48,166
That's right! The Z-Five.

86
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,291
Super, super!

87
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,291
Shiver me whiskers.

88
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,583
You made five new GUPs!

89
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,958
Think of ‘em as proto-GUPs, Kwazii.

90
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,791
GUPs in progress.

91
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,041
You mean they're not even finished yet?

92
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,125
Well, they're mostly finished.

93
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:07,833
Besides, sometimes you just gotta work
with what you got.

94
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:14,000
Just one little thing.
Whatever you do, don't push the Z button.

95
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,833
Okay, but what does it do?

96
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,958
Probably fires off the kelp cannons

97
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:22,208
or launches
the sailfish speed boosters, eh, Tweak?

98
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:27,708
Let's just say it's a new feature
I haven't been able to test out yet.

99
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,791
Understood, Tweak, and thanks.

100
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:33,083
These Z-GUPs should be perfect
for today's missions.

101
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,375
Octonauts, let's do this!

102
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:36,500
Aye-aye!

103
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:51,750
Octonauts, it's going to be
a very busy day.

104
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,458
Tweak's taking the GUPs
to the repair station…

105
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,083
Wait up, matey!

106
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,791
Wherever the GUP-B goes, I go too!

107
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,958
Dashi and Shellington are heading
to the South Pacific…

108
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:06,416
If the Omura's whale is out there,
we're going to find it.

109
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,416
Tunip and the Vegimals are working
on the seaweed farm…

110
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:20,416
And we're going towards Antarctica
to check on the chinstrap penguins.

111
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,083
Safe travels, everyone.

112
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,833
Bye-bye! Goodbye.

113
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:45,541
Thirty-three, thirty-four,

114
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:49,083
thirty-five, thirty-six.

115
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:56,875
This Z-One slowpoke
can barely do 36 loop-de-loops.

116
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:00,708
In the GUP-B, I can always do at least 67.

117
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,916
Well, once the GUP-B
gets a proper tune-up,

118
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,625
you can do
as many loop-de-loops as you like.

119
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:13,583
Here we are, the Octo-repair station.

120
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,416
Come on, help me park the GUPs.

121
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,666
In you go.

122
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,125
See you later, Z-One.

123
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:03,416
Last one.

124
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,375
Not so fast, matey.

125
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,958
I'm not letting the GUP-B out of me sight.

126
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:10,625
Suit yourself.

127
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,541
Watch the paint job, mateys!

128
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,500
Watch the ears too.

129
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,916
Kwazii, you've got nothing to worry about.

130
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,916
The GUP-B is in good hands.

131
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,250
And you don't need your helmet
or air tank in here now.

132
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,875
It's as dry as a stale fish biscuit.

133
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:46,416
Wow! I've never been
in this part of the repair station before.

134
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,583
Come on, I'll show you around.

135
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:54,291
We're on the highest level now.

136
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,583
There are two more below us.

137
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:59,250
Well, I'll be a sea monkey's uncle.

138
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,708
This place is even bigger
than I remember it.

139
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:03,708
What are those?

140
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:07,666
Those are air shafts. They run
through the entire repair station.

141
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:11,333
Without them, we wouldn't have air
to breathe down here.

142
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,666
And what's in there?

143
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,708
An Octo-Max suit.

144
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:19,791
I keep one on every level
for heavy lifting.

145
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:21,708
What?

146
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,875
<i>Number 87.</i>

147
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:27,041
<i>Polar bear strength training.</i>

148
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:32,208
<i>With the right attitude, anyone can</i>
<i>have the strength of a polar bear.</i>

149
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,916
What's going on?

150
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,416
It feels like a little tremor. You know,
when the sea floor starts shaking?

151
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,333
Happens all the time down here.

152
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,333
Do they always turn on
old training videos?

153
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,500
Must've messed
with the electrical system or something.

154
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:59,541
Sometimes all it takes is
a little polar bear strength.

155
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:12,541
Dashi, look! The Octo-recorder.

156
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:15,958
It's been picking up
more whale songs all morning.

157
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:19,375
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's look for the Omura's whale.

158
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,708
I mean, let's listen for it.

159
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,875
Hear anything, Shellington?

160
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,416
Nothing yet.

161
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,958
I hear waves crashing.

162
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,500
Crab claws clacking.

163
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,583
Sardines burping.

164
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,166
Dashi, listen.

165
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:58,750
That's the Omura's whale, all right.
It must be close.

166
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Shellington, wait.

167
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,166
Hurry, before it swims away.

168
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,916
No, Shellington, listen.

169
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,666
I don't like the sound of that at all.

170
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,541
Just sounds like a tremor to me.

171
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:16,083
Tremors happen all the time down
on the seafloor. Now, come on, let's--

172
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:18,750
Shellington, it's not just one tremor.

173
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:22,166
It's lots of tremors,
coming from every direction.

174
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,250
Something strange is going on.

175
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,833
I think you're right.

176
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,250
Captain. Come in, Captain.

177
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,833
Come in, Dashi.
How's the whale search going?

178
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,375
<i>It's going fine, Captain,</i>

179
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:38,375
but we're picking up
a lot of unusual activity down here.

180
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,375
Activity? What kind of activity?

181
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,416
We're hearing all kinds of tremors.

182
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,041
<i>Much more than usual.</i>

183
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,625
Captain, look!

184
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:48,625
Our scanners are picking up tremors too,
lots of them.

185
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:51,958
Here, here, and here.
They're all over the place.

186
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:55,416
Oh, strange. Very strange indeed.

187
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,000
The tremors seem to be in a ring shape,
all around the Pacific Ocean.

188
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,708
You don't suppose it's the--

189
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,041
<i>Captain, what was that?</i>

190
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,250
Captain?

191
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,291
Flappity flippers!
That seamount just exploded.

192
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,083
That's no seamount.

193
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,250
It's a volcano.

194
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:19,000
And it's shooting hot lava!

195
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,041
Peso, activate manual steering.

196
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,208
Aye, Captain.

197
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,958
Everybody, hang on.

198
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,583
Steady. Here we are.

199
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,541
That's it.

200
00:14:58,458 --> 00:14:59,458
That was close.

201
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:05,166
Captain? Are you okay? Captain?

202
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:10,166
Dashi, another tremor. A big one.

203
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,625
Whenever there's a tremor this big,
there's bound to be…

204
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,458
A tsunami wave!

205
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,750
Jumping jellyfish!

206
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,333
Hurry, back to the ship.

207
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:28,958
Hang on!

208
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:47,083
Oh me, oh my, now that's a big one!

209
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,541
Tweak, look out!

210
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:58,958
Oh no!

211
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,125
Run, matey!

212
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:07,625
Huh?

213
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,666
Oh no.

214
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,666
-Uh-oh.
-That can't be good.

215
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,666
Captain, what's going on?

216
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,000
I don't know, Peso.

217
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:35,083
It feels like every volcano
in the whole ocean is erupting at once.

218
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:37,083
You're not too far off, Captain.

219
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:40,875
All these volcanoes are part
of the Ring of Fire.

220
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,625
The Ring of Fire?

221
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,250
The Ring of Fire is a group of volcanoes

222
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,541
that stretches
all around the Pacific Ocean.

223
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:51,500
Some of the volcanoes are underwater,
and some are above it.

224
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:54,583
How many volcanoes
are we talking about, Professor?

225
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:59,125
Approximately 452.

226
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:02,833
-Four hundred and fifty-two?
-Uh-huh.

227
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:06,041
What we're seeing now is a chain reaction.

228
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,875
That's when a big eruption
on one part of the Ring of Fire

229
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:13,666
causes eruptions, tremors,
and tsunami waves all around the Pacific.

230
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,458
Flappity flippers!

231
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,375
I'm afraid this is only the beginning.

232
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:22,250
More eruptions are on the way,
and they could be even bigger.

233
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,833
Even bigger?

234
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:27,708
Captain, what about the rest of the crew?
We have to warn them.

235
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:31,625
Calling all Octonauts.
This is an emergency.

236
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:35,708
Come in. Kwazii? Dashi? Anyone?

237
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:39,458
Captain, the communication network's down.

238
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,666
You mean, we can't call the others?

239
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,208
This is the biggest disaster
the Octonauts have ever faced,

240
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:48,000
and we'll all have to face it on our own.

241
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:51,000
Let's just hope
everyone remembers their training.

242
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:55,875
Captain? I think we'd better hurry
and get to the chinstrap penguins.

243
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:58,666
Peso, I think we may have
to put that on hold

244
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,625
until we've dealt with
all these volcanoes.

245
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,625
But that's the problem, Captain.

246
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:07,125
The chinstrap penguins live
right on top of a volcano.

247
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,958
On top of a volcano?

248
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:11,041
It usually helps keep their eggs warm,

249
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:14,708
but according to the map,
it's about to erupt.

250
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,250
Say no more.

251
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:17,833
Full speed ahead.

252
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,125
All right, then.

253
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,875
Dashi? What do we do?

254
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,458
Well, we stay calm, that's for sure.

255
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:47,041
I'd say our first problem is
getting down from this tree.

256
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:54,125
Well, that's taken care of.
What's our next problem?

257
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,916
Now we've got to figure out where we are.

258
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,375
Looks like a deserted island.

259
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:06,541
Oh, look. That tsunami wave carried us
a very long way from the water.

260
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:11,083
I guess our next step is to figure out
how to get this back in there.

261
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,208
Better call for backup.

262
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:16,750
Dashi to Octopod. Come in, Octopod.

263
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,541
Can anyone hear me?

264
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,500
Dashi to Octopod. Come in, Octopod.

265
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:23,708
A coconut crab!

266
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:28,541
I'm stuck. That big wave really tossed me.

267
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,083
Here, let me give you a hand.

268
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:34,166
We coconut crabs live on land,
and we can't swim, you know?

269
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,416
There you go.

270
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,958
Thanks, Mr. Octonaut, sir.

271
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,291
How does he know I'm an Octonaut?

272
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,583
Tweak. Do you read me, Tweak?

273
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,208
Any luck?

274
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:47,250
Not yet.

275
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:51,666
Whatever caused that tsunami must've
shut down our communications network.

276
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,250
Isn't there a backup system?

277
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:59,541
Shellington, wait!
We don't know what those buttons do.

278
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,291
Now we know what that button does.

279
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,333
Shellington, you did it.

280
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:12,666
The Z-Four has a land mode.
We'll be back in the water in no time.

281
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,000
Not very fast, is it?

282
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:28,416
Well, Tweak did say
the Z-GUPs weren't finished.

283
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,791
Sounds like the engine's
about to give out.

284
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:37,333
I don't think that came from the engines.

285
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:38,750
Listen.

286
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:41,458
It's something outside.

287
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,958
Come on, we'd better check it out.

288
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,000
It's coming from that hill.

289
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,791
Strange. There's nothing here.

290
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,166
Another tremor.

291
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,250
It's not a tremor.

292
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:07,500
It's the Omura's whale!

293
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,958
Hello. Sorry to bother you.

294
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:14,666
Bother us? We were standing on <i>your</i> back.

295
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:20,875
I didn't mind. But, as you can see,
I do seem to be in a bit of trouble.

296
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:24,291
The tsunami wave washed you ashore too!

297
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:28,791
I've always wanted to see
an Omura's whale, but not like this.

298
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:32,041
We have to get
you back into the water, fast!

299
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:35,041
Please, don't go out of your way
on account of me.

300
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,291
I'm sure you must be very busy and…

301
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:43,875
Pardon me, I'm just feeling a bit dry.

302
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:46,125
Don't worry. We're here to help.

303
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:49,708
Now that's a tremor!

304
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:51,958
And I see what's causing it.

305
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,208
A volcano!

306
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,958
The lava's heading straight for us.

307
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:58,750
We've got to get out of here.

308
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:03,958
I really don't mean to sound pushy,
but do you think we could please hurry?

309
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:31,250
Hurry, matey!

310
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:50,458
Quick, in there.
We can seal the doors to stop the…

311
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:54,833
Tweak!

312
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:56,916
Kwazii, I'm stuck!

313
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,291
I've got you, matey.

314
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:06,500
Kwazii, hurry.

315
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:10,041
This just needs
a little polar bear strength!

316
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:14,708
Let's get out of here!

317
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:21,500
That was a close one.

318
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:24,250
Polar bear strength, huh?

319
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:27,125
Gotta remember to thank
the captain for that one.

320
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:31,708
If we ever want to see the captain again,
we've gotta find a way out of here.

321
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:34,500
That isn't good.

322
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:36,500
That isn't good at all.

323
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,291
The station's flooding fast.

324
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:42,000
Then let's swim our way out.

325
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,083
We don't have our air tanks, remember?

326
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:48,333
Right. No swimming.

327
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:52,791
What about the GUPs?
The GUPs are all okay, aren't they?

328
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:57,958
The GUPs are fine,
but the hangars they're in look like this.

329
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,916
There's no way to launch them.

330
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:04,833
Wait, the Z-One's hangar is still okay.

331
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:08,333
The Z-One? Not that old slowpoke.

332
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:11,416
That old slowpoke
is our only hope for escaping,

333
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,625
but it won't be easy to get to.

334
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:17,625
It's up here on the top level
where we are,

335
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:20,500
but the hallway's blocked.

336
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:24,416
To get to it, we have to go
all the way to the bottom level,

337
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,583
make our way around,
and then come all the way back up.

338
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:30,583
And how will we do that?

339
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:34,375
Well, that's the tricky part.

340
00:24:34,958 --> 00:24:36,416
I suppose we could…

341
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:41,166
That wouldn't work,
but we might be able to…

342
00:24:42,208 --> 00:24:44,375
Tweak? Do you smell that?

343
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:46,750
Not now, Kwazii. I'm busy.

344
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:51,125
I could try
to short-circuit the breakers, or--

345
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:52,375
Fire!

346
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,583
Fire?

347
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:01,708
-We've gotta get out of here!
-Quick, through that door!

348
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:02,833
Yow!

349
00:25:05,541 --> 00:25:07,250
How do we get through that?

350
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:08,458
Oh me, oh my.

351
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:12,500
Look out! Yow!

352
00:25:25,708 --> 00:25:26,625
Yeah.

353
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,333
Right.

354
00:25:28,416 --> 00:25:30,208
Tweak, what are you doing?

355
00:25:30,291 --> 00:25:33,458
Just thinking like an engineer.

356
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:51,083
That was cool.

357
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:52,916
Let's go!

358
00:25:56,708 --> 00:25:57,708
After you.

359
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:04,250
This way.

360
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:09,458
The elevator ahead might be able
to take us down to the lower levels.

361
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,833
Nope!

362
00:26:26,791 --> 00:26:29,416
Oh me, oh my. We're trapped!

363
00:26:30,666 --> 00:26:31,791
Maybe not.

364
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:34,833
What about in here?

365
00:26:34,916 --> 00:26:36,833
Kwazii, you're a genius.

366
00:26:36,916 --> 00:26:40,500
This chute'll take us down
to the lower level. Come on.

367
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:48,250
I can't believe I didn't think of it.

368
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:52,375
That's ‘cause you weren't
thinking like a pirate, matey.

369
00:26:52,458 --> 00:26:54,000
Where does this chute come out?

370
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:55,583
The compost room.

371
00:26:55,666 --> 00:26:57,375
The compost room?

372
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:06,416
I thought that chute smelled funny.

373
00:27:07,416 --> 00:27:09,916
The only way out of here is up there.

374
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:15,708
-What's that sound?
-Uh-oh.

375
00:27:15,791 --> 00:27:20,125
That's the compost grinder.
It makes anything that's too big, smaller.

376
00:27:20,958 --> 00:27:24,625
I like myself the size I am.
How are we going to get up there?

377
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,625
Sometimes, you gotta work
with what you got.

378
00:27:44,208 --> 00:27:45,458
I gotcha.

379
00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:47,375
Thanks, matey.

380
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:50,375
To get to the Z-One,
we have to go through here.

381
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:57,500
Looks like we're swimming after all.

382
00:27:58,208 --> 00:27:59,750
Yup. Come on.

383
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:11,708
Help!

384
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:14,125
Help! Help!

385
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,541
Oh no!

386
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:26,375
Gotcha.

387
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Thanks!

388
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,833
What are we gonna do?

389
00:28:48,125 --> 00:28:51,250
<i>Octonauts video training series,</i>
<i>lesson nine.</i>

390
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:53,041
<i>Dealing with disasters.</i>

391
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:56,458
<i>First up, whirlpools.</i>

392
00:28:57,583 --> 00:29:00,708
<i>Whirlpools can really take you for a spin.</i>

393
00:29:00,791 --> 00:29:02,875
<i>What you need to remember is…</i>

394
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:06,458
<i>Next, all about algae blooms.</i>

395
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:10,708
<i>Too much algae</i>
<i>can make for a really slimy situation…</i>

396
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,250
<i>And finally, lava rescues.</i>

397
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,791
Lava rescues.

398
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:21,625
<i>When dealing with lava, first construct</i>
<i>a barrier, if you can, to stop the flow.</i>

399
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:23,208
Barrier.

400
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:28,000
<i>Then, search the area for creatures</i>
<i>or plants that might be in danger.</i>

401
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:31,875
<i>Remember,</i>
<i>they may be frightened and confused,</i>

402
00:29:31,958 --> 00:29:35,583
<i>so they'll be looking to you</i>
<i>for leadership and courage.</i>

403
00:29:35,666 --> 00:29:37,750
Leadership and courage!

404
00:29:42,958 --> 00:29:45,208
Vegimals, let's do this!

405
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:47,291
Okay.

406
00:29:48,625 --> 00:29:50,083
I got it!

407
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:54,750
Vegimals, build a barrier.

408
00:29:54,833 --> 00:29:56,583
Protect the crop.

409
00:30:07,541 --> 00:30:08,958
Faster!

410
00:30:27,708 --> 00:30:30,791
Okay, Vegimals, now pick up the seaweed.

411
00:30:53,416 --> 00:30:55,041
Help!

412
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:57,250
Easy now. I’m coming.

413
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:58,625
Out you go.

414
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,833
Faster!

415
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:46,916
Vegimals…

416
00:31:55,291 --> 00:31:56,791
Barrot! Kelpa! Kelpa!

417
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:03,583
Everybody, hold on.

418
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:10,041
Hey, what about me?

419
00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:12,250
Yeah, and me!

420
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:14,458
You gotta save us!

421
00:32:15,291 --> 00:32:16,500
Hang on!

422
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:19,083
Save us!

423
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:27,333
Oh man, that was a close one.

424
00:32:27,416 --> 00:32:28,750
Now, what's for lunch?

425
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:31,333
Lunch? Is that all you ever think about?

426
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:40,666
That one almost got us.

427
00:32:41,166 --> 00:32:44,416
Captain, we're arriving
at the chinstrap penguins’ island.

428
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,958
Or should I say their volcano?

429
00:32:47,041 --> 00:32:49,458
Thanks, Professor. Surfacing now.

430
00:32:53,416 --> 00:32:55,500
Volcano straight ahead.

431
00:32:55,583 --> 00:32:58,208
Getting onto that island won't be easy.

432
00:32:58,291 --> 00:33:01,000
We'll have to get past
all those big, jagged rocks.

433
00:33:01,083 --> 00:33:03,583
And that's just the first problem.

434
00:33:03,666 --> 00:33:06,541
We'll still have to find
a way to get all the penguins…

435
00:33:06,625 --> 00:33:07,875
And their eggs.

436
00:33:07,958 --> 00:33:12,125
…and their eggs off the volcano
and into the Octopod.

437
00:33:12,208 --> 00:33:15,333
There's no way
they'll all fit into our Z-GUPs.

438
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:20,625
What about the life rafts?
We've got plenty of those.

439
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:23,625
There won't be time
to launch enough rafts,

440
00:33:23,708 --> 00:33:27,083
but if we launch them all at once…

441
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:32,375
If we connect all the rafts together,
we could make an evacuation slide.

442
00:33:32,875 --> 00:33:35,041
Captain, that's brilliant.

443
00:33:35,125 --> 00:33:37,791
Peso, prepare to launch the Z-GUPs.

444
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:39,291
Aye, aye, Captain.

445
00:33:42,333 --> 00:33:45,875
Professor, gather up
as many life rafts as you can find.

446
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:47,875
You're in charge of the Octopod.

447
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:49,750
Me?

448
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:51,333
In charge of the Octopod?

449
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:06,791
Careful, Peso. The waves
are slamming us into those rocks.

450
00:34:06,875 --> 00:34:08,583
Steady.

451
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:18,916
We'll have to find
another way onto the island.

452
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Hello!

453
00:34:20,083 --> 00:34:21,625
Captain, look!

454
00:34:22,583 --> 00:34:23,583
This way.

455
00:34:33,458 --> 00:34:35,875
There's only one way onto that island.

456
00:34:35,958 --> 00:34:37,583
The penguin way!

457
00:34:37,666 --> 00:34:38,750
Follow me!

458
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,750
The penguin way.

459
00:34:51,833 --> 00:34:53,666
I'll have to remember that one.

460
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:55,916
Peso!

461
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,375
Hello, there.

462
00:35:01,458 --> 00:35:05,166
Good to see you too.
Oh my, you've grown tall.

463
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:09,666
Captain, these are my cousins,
the chinstrap penguins.

464
00:35:10,291 --> 00:35:12,291
Yes, pleased to meet you.

465
00:35:12,375 --> 00:35:16,541
I wish there was time to chat,
but you're all in very great danger.

466
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:18,125
-Oh no!
-I knew it.

467
00:35:18,625 --> 00:35:20,125
I knew something was wrong.

468
00:35:20,208 --> 00:35:23,416
These volcanic cracks
usually keep our eggs nice and warm.

469
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,541
But lately they've been too warm.

470
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:28,000
Our poor little eggs were almost cooked.

471
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:31,166
That's because
this volcano is about to erupt.

472
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,833
Erupt?

473
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:41,208
Don't worry. We're going to get you…

474
00:35:41,291 --> 00:35:42,250
And your eggs.

475
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:45,458
…and your eggs
off this island safe and sound.

476
00:35:45,541 --> 00:35:47,958
But where are we going to go?

477
00:35:48,041 --> 00:35:51,791
Barnacles to Inkling.
We're ready to begin the evacuation.

478
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:55,000
Oh dear.

479
00:35:55,916 --> 00:35:56,875
<i>Professor?</i>

480
00:35:56,958 --> 00:35:58,958
Octopod standing by.

481
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:00,333
<i>Launch the rafts.</i>

482
00:36:02,125 --> 00:36:03,208
Yes, Captain.

483
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:05,625
It'll just be one moment.

484
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:12,083
<i>Professor, we don't have much time.</i>
<i>The volcano could erupt at any moment.</i>

485
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:17,250
Yes, of course, Captain. Just need
to raise the ship up a bit first.

486
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:31,916
There.

487
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Now to launch the rafts.

488
00:36:36,166 --> 00:36:38,166
Why must there be so many buttons?

489
00:36:38,708 --> 00:36:40,875
Let's try this one.

490
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:50,000
Goodness.

491
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:55,250
Oh, which button?

492
00:36:56,708 --> 00:36:58,208
That one? No.

493
00:37:00,708 --> 00:37:05,083
<i>Lesson 23: Computer systems made easy.</i>

494
00:37:05,166 --> 00:37:06,625
That's not it either.

495
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:10,416
<i>The Octopod systems may seem complicated,</i>

496
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,750
<i>but they're actually quite simple.</i>

497
00:37:12,833 --> 00:37:14,250
<i>Just ask Dashi.</i>

498
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:16,541
<i>Ask me what, Captain?</i>

499
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:20,833
<i>Oh, sorry. I'm so used to being</i>
<i>on the other side of the camera.</i>

500
00:37:20,916 --> 00:37:22,875
<i>Should I talk about the computers or…</i>

501
00:37:22,958 --> 00:37:26,041
<i>Professor! The rafts. Are they ready?</i>

502
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:28,958
Almost, Captain.

503
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:32,208
If only Dashi were here.

504
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:37,041
She always knows what button to press,
and she always stays so calm.

505
00:37:39,708 --> 00:37:43,125
Calm. Just stay calm like Dashi.

506
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:45,958
<i>Professor, launch the rafts now!</i>

507
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:52,125
Already on it, Captain.

508
00:37:59,458 --> 00:38:01,000
Good work, Professor.

509
00:38:01,625 --> 00:38:02,708
We have to hurry.

510
00:38:02,791 --> 00:38:04,208
Everyone onto the slide.

511
00:38:23,708 --> 00:38:24,958
Good job.

512
00:38:25,041 --> 00:38:26,375
Everyone keep moving.

513
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:29,541
Single file. Mothers and babies first.

514
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:31,375
You're doing great.

515
00:38:34,666 --> 00:38:35,666
My egg!

516
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,583
Oh no, it's going over the edge!

517
00:38:45,666 --> 00:38:47,000
Oh no!

518
00:38:48,208 --> 00:38:49,083
Gotcha.

519
00:38:49,583 --> 00:38:51,083
Oh, bravo!

520
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:54,500
Uh-oh.

521
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:57,791
You've got a crack.
Let's get you bandaged up.

522
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,333
There.

523
00:39:02,166 --> 00:39:03,250
Here you are.

524
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:04,666
Thank you, Peso.

525
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:06,041
Well done, Peso.

526
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:11,500
<i>Professor, retract the slide.</i>

527
00:39:16,708 --> 00:39:17,791
Now, let's…

528
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:22,083
Run!

529
00:39:23,791 --> 00:39:24,750
Jump!

530
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,375
Are all eggs accounted for?

531
00:39:52,458 --> 00:39:55,541
They're all tucked in
to their heated beds, nice and cozy.

532
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:58,041
Your egg will be fine if it stays warm.

533
00:39:58,666 --> 00:40:02,666
Thank you. I don't know what we
would've done without your help.

534
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:05,041
We made it out of there just in time,

535
00:40:05,125 --> 00:40:09,083
but there are still volcanoes erupting
all around the Ring of Fire.

536
00:40:09,166 --> 00:40:11,458
I just hope everyone else is okay.

537
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:17,333
Hit it, Dashi.

538
00:40:27,541 --> 00:40:28,625
This isn't working.

539
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:32,333
We're not gonna make it
back to the water in time.

540
00:40:32,416 --> 00:40:35,083
And not to keep going on
about my problems,

541
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:38,083
but my skin's getting really dry.

542
00:40:38,166 --> 00:40:40,791
Really, really dry.

543
00:40:40,875 --> 00:40:42,583
How about some coconut water?

544
00:40:46,375 --> 00:40:48,708
That's much better.

545
00:40:48,791 --> 00:40:52,000
That's them, Dad. The ones who helped me.

546
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:55,291
Hello, down there.
You're Kwazii's mates, aren't ya?

547
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:57,583
Yes, but who are--

548
00:40:57,666 --> 00:41:00,875
We're the coconut crabs.
I'm Claude, this is Claudette,

549
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:04,291
and there are our little ones,
Clem, Clyde, and Clarence.

550
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:07,083
But our friends all call us…

551
00:41:07,166 --> 00:41:09,333
The Claw!

552
00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:13,750
You helped my little Clarence,
and now we'd like to help you.

553
00:41:13,833 --> 00:41:16,083
Times like this,
we've all got to help each other.

554
00:41:16,666 --> 00:41:18,541
Everybody ready?

555
00:41:18,625 --> 00:41:19,750
Ready!

556
00:41:20,375 --> 00:41:21,791
Crack those coconuts!

557
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,375
Keep it coming, please.

558
00:41:32,583 --> 00:41:34,208
We've got to keep moving.

559
00:41:40,916 --> 00:41:44,375
<i>Lesson 77. Emergency engineering.</i>

560
00:41:44,458 --> 00:41:48,166
<i>When it comes to engineering on the fly,</i>
<i>Tweak has a saying.</i>

561
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:50,208
<i>Oh, right.</i>

562
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:54,583
<i>Sometimes you just gotta work</i>
<i>with what you got.</i>

563
00:41:58,583 --> 00:41:59,791
Coconuts.

564
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,458
Coconuts.

565
00:42:03,083 --> 00:42:06,083
Dashi, I don't think
now is a good time for a snack.

566
00:42:06,166 --> 00:42:08,416
How are we going to move the whale?

567
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:11,500
Maybe these coconuts can help us.

568
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:15,250
It's like Tweak says, "Sometimes you gotta
work with what you've got."

569
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:19,375
And right now, we've got coconuts.

570
00:42:19,458 --> 00:42:21,041
But how--

571
00:42:25,875 --> 00:42:27,250
That's it.

572
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:30,166
If we put coconuts under the whale…

573
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:34,458
We can use them as rollers
to tow you to the water.

574
00:42:34,541 --> 00:42:38,458
I have to say, I really like that plan.

575
00:42:38,541 --> 00:42:39,458
Me too.

576
00:42:39,541 --> 00:42:41,166
Let us lend you a claw.

577
00:42:48,916 --> 00:42:50,583
Here comes the lava!

578
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:52,250
Oh no!

579
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:58,041
Here we go!

580
00:43:02,833 --> 00:43:03,916
It's working!

581
00:43:07,125 --> 00:43:08,916
That kind of tickles.

582
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,458
Thanks, coconut crabs!

583
00:43:11,166 --> 00:43:12,166
Shellington?

584
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:16,833
I'm sure you must've already noticed,
but I'm running out of coconut rollers.

585
00:43:16,916 --> 00:43:17,750
No problem!

586
00:43:22,375 --> 00:43:23,750
Keep going, Shellington!

587
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:33,833
I don't know how much longer
I can keep this up.

588
00:43:38,625 --> 00:43:39,458
Shellington…

589
00:43:40,125 --> 00:43:41,166
Catch!

590
00:43:42,791 --> 00:43:45,250
Claude? You should be
back with your family.

591
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:46,833
Oh, don't you worry about me.

592
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:50,916
After all, times like this,
we've all got to lend a helping claw.

593
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:03,791
We're almost there.

594
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:07,916
We're here!

595
00:44:08,625 --> 00:44:09,916
Prepare to dive.

596
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,458
But what about Claude?
Coconut crabs can't swim.

597
00:44:14,041 --> 00:44:17,083
Excuse me, but maybe I can help with that.

598
00:44:17,166 --> 00:44:20,708
Like you said, "We've all gotta
help each other," right?

599
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:22,125
Hop on to my tail.

600
00:44:22,208 --> 00:44:23,083
Righty-ho.

601
00:44:23,833 --> 00:44:25,208
Where's your family?

602
00:44:25,291 --> 00:44:27,916
Up there in those trees, where it's safe.

603
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:31,291
Well, then, if you don't mind,
prepare to fly.

604
00:44:31,375 --> 00:44:34,208
Fly? But coconut crabs can't fly.

605
00:44:38,625 --> 00:44:39,750
Thanks, mates!

606
00:44:39,833 --> 00:44:42,541
Goodbye, coconut crabs.
Thanks for all your--

607
00:44:43,416 --> 00:44:44,833
Shellington, climb on!

608
00:44:51,791 --> 00:44:52,875
We made it.

609
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,333
And just in time too.

610
00:44:56,708 --> 00:45:00,916
Guys, I really hate
to ruin the celebration, but look!

611
00:45:02,083 --> 00:45:04,416
Every volcano's erupting at once.

612
00:45:04,916 --> 00:45:08,875
Jumping jellyfish! It's a chain reaction.

613
00:45:14,958 --> 00:45:17,625
I still stink of that compost room.

614
00:45:17,708 --> 00:45:19,291
We almost there, Tweak?

615
00:45:19,375 --> 00:45:22,000
The main air shaft's
at the end of this hallway,

616
00:45:22,083 --> 00:45:27,125
and if we can get to it, we can get up
to the top level and escape in the Z-One.

617
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:29,666
You make it sound so easy.

618
00:45:35,916 --> 00:45:38,958
No way through.
Think we can swim under it?

619
00:45:39,458 --> 00:45:41,583
Only one way to find out.

620
00:45:41,666 --> 00:45:44,000
I'll go through first with this rope.

621
00:45:44,083 --> 00:45:47,666
When I give it a tug, that means it's safe
for you to follow me through.

622
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:48,708
Got it.

623
00:45:48,791 --> 00:45:49,875
Here I go.

624
00:45:50,416 --> 00:45:52,375
See you on the other side, matey.

625
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:24,333
Made it!

626
00:46:24,416 --> 00:46:27,166
Tweak! I found a way through.

627
00:46:27,708 --> 00:46:28,791
Tweak?

628
00:46:28,875 --> 00:46:30,625
Can you hear me, matey?

629
00:46:32,708 --> 00:46:34,250
Oh no!

630
00:46:36,541 --> 00:46:38,208
What in the seven seas?

631
00:46:57,625 --> 00:46:58,916
Hey, Kwazii.

632
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,291
Look what I found.

633
00:47:01,875 --> 00:47:03,875
I found you this air tank too.

634
00:47:08,791 --> 00:47:09,791
Thanks, Tweak.

635
00:47:11,125 --> 00:47:12,958
You really saved my whiskers.

636
00:47:13,041 --> 00:47:15,041
Things look pretty bad up ahead,

637
00:47:15,125 --> 00:47:17,916
but I can bash through
with this Octo-mech suit.

638
00:47:19,583 --> 00:47:21,375
Now you're talking, matey.

639
00:47:21,458 --> 00:47:22,375
Follow me.

640
00:47:24,416 --> 00:47:25,541
Yeah!

641
00:47:27,666 --> 00:47:28,583
Take that!

642
00:47:29,166 --> 00:47:30,166
And that!

643
00:47:30,916 --> 00:47:31,833
And that!

644
00:47:35,458 --> 00:47:37,916
Look! There's the door to the air shaft!

645
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:51,375
This shaft will take us
back up to the Z-One.

646
00:47:51,458 --> 00:47:53,666
And how will we get up there?

647
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:56,916
With a good, old-fashioned grappling hook.

648
00:48:04,583 --> 00:48:07,000
I gotta get me one of those.

649
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:08,541
Going up.

650
00:48:20,291 --> 00:48:21,375
We made it.

651
00:48:21,458 --> 00:48:23,083
And there's the Z-One.

652
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:29,666
Tweak to Octopod.

653
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:31,416
Come in, Octopod.

654
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:35,041
Communication network's down.

655
00:48:35,125 --> 00:48:38,375
Can you fix it?
We gotta let the others know we're okay.

656
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:42,541
There might be a way
to reboot it from here.

657
00:48:45,291 --> 00:48:46,708
Anything I can do to help?

658
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:48,791
Well, actually, yeah.

659
00:48:48,875 --> 00:48:51,958
See that emergency supply kit over there?

660
00:48:52,041 --> 00:48:53,208
What do you need?

661
00:48:53,291 --> 00:48:55,041
A wrench? A screwdriver?

662
00:48:55,125 --> 00:48:58,125
Actually, I was hoping
for an emergency carrot.

663
00:49:00,125 --> 00:49:01,666
Sure thing, matey.

664
00:49:07,125 --> 00:49:07,958
Not bad.

665
00:49:08,583 --> 00:49:09,458
There!

666
00:49:11,083 --> 00:49:15,250
<i>Welcome back to a very special installment</i>
<i>of the Octonauts video training series,</i>

667
00:49:15,333 --> 00:49:19,166
<i>lesson 352: A field guide to fish burps.</i>

668
00:49:19,833 --> 00:49:22,416
<i>Everyone knows</i>
<i>the sound of a sardine burp,</i>

669
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:25,708
<i>but many other species of fish</i>
<i>are known to burp as well.</i>

670
00:49:25,791 --> 00:49:27,458
<i>Let's listen to a few of them.</i>

671
00:49:28,125 --> 00:49:30,750
Not another training video.

672
00:49:30,833 --> 00:49:33,041
Hang on, let me try that again.

673
00:49:39,875 --> 00:49:42,750
Okay, systems rebooting.

674
00:49:49,041 --> 00:49:51,041
This ought to get their attention.

675
00:49:51,125 --> 00:49:52,041
Shall we?

676
00:49:52,125 --> 00:49:54,458
Sound the Octo Alert!

677
00:50:04,458 --> 00:50:07,416
<i>Tweak, Kwazii? Is that you?</i>

678
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,958
Yep. Got the whole crew here.

679
00:50:10,041 --> 00:50:11,958
<i>Dashi and Shellington reporting in.</i>

680
00:50:12,041 --> 00:50:13,041
<i>Hello.</i>

681
00:50:19,125 --> 00:50:22,250
Octonauts! It's good to see you all again.

682
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:23,875
Is everyone okay?

683
00:50:23,958 --> 00:50:27,916
<i>We're fine, Cap,</i>
<i>but what's going on out there?</i>

684
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,708
<i>And where'd all them penguins come from?</i>

685
00:50:30,791 --> 00:50:32,166
<i>It's a long story,</i>

686
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:36,875
which involves a massive chain
of eruptions all around the Ring of Fire.

687
00:50:36,958 --> 00:50:41,541
<i>The Ring of Fire!</i>
<i>So that's what caused the tsunami wave.</i>

688
00:50:41,625 --> 00:50:43,000
<i>And the tremors.</i>

689
00:50:43,083 --> 00:50:44,458
<i>And the lava.</i>

690
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:47,875
It's caused major problems
all over the Pacific Ocean.

691
00:50:47,958 --> 00:50:49,750
And it's not over yet.

692
00:50:49,833 --> 00:50:54,708
Most of the eruptions are dying down,
but there's still one more on the way,

693
00:50:54,791 --> 00:50:57,041
and it's going to be big!

694
00:50:57,125 --> 00:50:59,041
I'm seeing it here too.

695
00:50:59,125 --> 00:51:03,916
Looks like a big old undersea volcano
off the coast of Japan.

696
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,041
The biggest I've ever seen!

697
00:51:06,125 --> 00:51:07,541
Jumping jellyfish.

698
00:51:07,625 --> 00:51:11,250
That volcano must be home
to all kinds of sea creatures.

699
00:51:11,333 --> 00:51:14,083
We have to rescue them before it erupts.

700
00:51:14,166 --> 00:51:17,250
Aye! But how are we all
going to get there in time?

701
00:51:17,333 --> 00:51:20,875
It'll take days to fix the repair station
and dig out all the GUPs.

702
00:51:21,416 --> 00:51:24,375
<i>And the Z-GUPs</i>
<i>aren't exactly the speediest.</i>

703
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:29,291
Well, there is still one GUP we can use.

704
00:51:29,375 --> 00:51:30,208
Is there?

705
00:51:30,291 --> 00:51:34,208
Everybody, hop in your Z-GUPs now.

706
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:38,625
Goodbye!

707
00:51:46,375 --> 00:51:47,875
Z-helmets on.

708
00:51:54,416 --> 00:51:57,875
Y'all remember that Z button
I told you not to press?

709
00:51:57,958 --> 00:51:58,916
Yes?

710
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,083
Yes, indeed.

711
00:52:01,875 --> 00:52:03,708
I sure hope this works.

712
00:52:03,791 --> 00:52:05,750
Okay, y'all, press it!

713
00:52:13,791 --> 00:52:15,000
Hey!

714
00:52:18,291 --> 00:52:20,125
It's actually working!

715
00:52:23,666 --> 00:52:24,625
Yow!

716
00:52:31,708 --> 00:52:34,458
Tweak, the hatch is still closed.

717
00:52:34,541 --> 00:52:36,208
Yup. It's jammed.

718
00:52:36,291 --> 00:52:37,416
Jammed?

719
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,583
Don't get your whiskers in a twist.

720
00:52:39,666 --> 00:52:41,500
I got a plan.

721
00:52:42,041 --> 00:52:43,791
Yow!

722
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,625
Now that's thinking like a pirate.

723
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:07,583
We made it.

724
00:53:07,666 --> 00:53:08,875
Incredible.

725
00:53:08,958 --> 00:53:10,041
Hi, guys.

726
00:53:11,708 --> 00:53:12,708
That was cool.

727
00:53:13,208 --> 00:53:14,125
Yeah.

728
00:53:14,208 --> 00:53:16,708
It's not over yet. Tweak?

729
00:53:16,791 --> 00:53:21,541
Okay, everyone,
prepare for transformation.

730
00:53:21,625 --> 00:53:23,125
Transformation?

731
00:53:23,708 --> 00:53:25,333
In five,

732
00:53:25,416 --> 00:53:26,458
four,

733
00:53:26,541 --> 00:53:27,708
three,

734
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:29,250
two,

735
00:53:29,333 --> 00:53:30,166
one.

736
00:53:37,875 --> 00:53:39,875
Transformation complete.

737
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:44,791
Octonauts, welcome aboard the Mega GUP-Z!

738
00:53:44,875 --> 00:53:46,625
-Shiver me whiskers.
-Oh wow!

739
00:53:46,708 --> 00:53:47,791
Very impressive.

740
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,750
Tweak, it's amazing.

741
00:53:50,833 --> 00:53:54,625
It should have everything we need
to deal with that last volcano.

742
00:53:54,708 --> 00:53:57,500
Looks like you modeled it
after the vent shrimp.

743
00:53:57,583 --> 00:54:00,208
They can withstand
the hottest temperatures on Earth.

744
00:54:01,083 --> 00:54:02,541
Good eye, Shellington.

745
00:54:02,625 --> 00:54:06,125
Like a vent shrimp,
the Mega GUP-Z is heatproof,

746
00:54:06,208 --> 00:54:09,083
and it's perfect
for scooping up sea critters.

747
00:54:09,166 --> 00:54:10,875
Impressive, Tweak.

748
00:54:10,958 --> 00:54:13,416
Thanks, Cap!
Ready to take the driver's seat?

749
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,250
-Ready.
-Activating Z-Seat swap.

750
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:19,125
Wait a minute, how--

751
00:54:25,333 --> 00:54:28,291
It's gonna take all of us
working together to operate it.

752
00:54:35,333 --> 00:54:36,708
Everyone ready?

753
00:54:36,791 --> 00:54:37,666
Ready!

754
00:54:38,166 --> 00:54:39,375
Here we go!

755
00:54:44,375 --> 00:54:46,666
Next stop, the volcano.

756
00:54:51,958 --> 00:54:53,791
Jumping jellyfish.

757
00:54:53,875 --> 00:54:56,666
That's the biggest volcano I've ever seen.

758
00:54:59,875 --> 00:55:02,833
And it's completely covered
with sea creatures.

759
00:55:02,916 --> 00:55:05,583
Dashi, how much time
do we have before it erupts?

760
00:55:05,666 --> 00:55:07,125
Not long, Captain.

761
00:55:07,208 --> 00:55:10,833
The lava's building up inside the volcano,
and when it reaches the top…

762
00:55:10,916 --> 00:55:12,166
Kaboom.

763
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:16,083
Then we've got to get all the creatures
away from here before that happens.

764
00:55:16,666 --> 00:55:21,583
<i>Attention, sea creatures!</i>
<i>This volcano is about to erupt.</i>

765
00:55:21,666 --> 00:55:22,833
Erupt?

766
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:24,458
Oh no!

767
00:55:24,958 --> 00:55:29,208
<i>If you can swim away,</i>
<i>you should do so immediately.</i>

768
00:55:29,291 --> 00:55:30,500
We're out of here!

769
00:55:31,791 --> 00:55:33,083
Wait for me.

770
00:55:33,166 --> 00:55:35,083
You don't have to tell us twice.

771
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:41,208
<i>Everyone else, sit tight.</i>
<i>The Octonauts are coming to the rescue.</i>

772
00:55:47,291 --> 00:55:49,541
Activating suction claw.

773
00:55:54,416 --> 00:55:55,791
Snails straight ahead.

774
00:56:00,291 --> 00:56:01,791
Help us!

775
00:56:07,708 --> 00:56:08,666
Hello!

776
00:56:09,541 --> 00:56:10,791
Don’t worry!

777
00:56:10,875 --> 00:56:11,833
Got you.

778
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:15,458
Oh no!

779
00:56:27,375 --> 00:56:29,125
Over there, a spider crab!

780
00:56:40,041 --> 00:56:41,083
Got you!

781
00:56:41,916 --> 00:56:43,083
Thanks.

782
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:44,375
Cap, look.

783
00:56:44,458 --> 00:56:45,583
Help!

784
00:56:49,666 --> 00:56:51,583
Sea urchins above you, Peso!

785
00:56:51,666 --> 00:56:53,916
Save us!

786
00:56:56,083 --> 00:56:57,333
Help!

787
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,166
What was that?

788
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:10,208
The rocks are sealing us in.

789
00:57:11,333 --> 00:57:13,500
We need to get out of here!

790
00:57:13,583 --> 00:57:14,833
I can't see!

791
00:57:14,916 --> 00:57:17,333
Activating extra bright lights.

792
00:57:18,041 --> 00:57:20,000
An opening straight ahead.

793
00:57:26,875 --> 00:57:27,875
We made it!

794
00:57:28,875 --> 00:57:31,750
Scans show the volcano is
clear of creatures, Captain.

795
00:57:31,833 --> 00:57:33,375
Well done, Octonauts.

796
00:57:36,666 --> 00:57:39,333
Captain, we've got to clear out
of here ourselves.

797
00:57:39,416 --> 00:57:41,083
The volcano is about to erupt.

798
00:57:44,375 --> 00:57:46,041
Octonauts, prepare to--

799
00:57:46,125 --> 00:57:47,541
<i>Captain, wait!</i>

800
00:57:47,625 --> 00:57:48,791
Peso, what is it?

801
00:57:48,875 --> 00:57:51,500
I just saw something down there,

802
00:57:51,583 --> 00:57:53,416
inside the volcano!

803
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,583
Inside? Are you sure?

804
00:57:55,666 --> 00:57:57,041
<i>Yes, Captain.</i>

805
00:57:57,125 --> 00:57:59,291
All right. Here we go.

806
00:58:02,625 --> 00:58:04,333
Flappity flippers!

807
00:58:04,416 --> 00:58:05,833
-Yeah!
-Oh me, oh my!

808
00:58:05,916 --> 00:58:09,000
Creatures living inside a volcano.

809
00:58:09,083 --> 00:58:10,458
Fascinating.

810
00:58:10,541 --> 00:58:14,083
They're just swimming around in there
without a care in the world.

811
00:58:14,583 --> 00:58:16,291
Attention, creatures!

812
00:58:16,375 --> 00:58:19,416
<i>You must leave the volcano right away.</i>

813
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,583
What? Leave the volcano?

814
00:58:21,666 --> 00:58:23,458
Why would we do a thing like that?

815
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:25,958
Yes. We like it in here.

816
00:58:26,041 --> 00:58:28,875
Though it is
feeling warmer than usual today.

817
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:31,750
Yeah, and shakier.

818
00:58:31,833 --> 00:58:34,875
That's because the volcano's about to--

819
00:58:35,416 --> 00:58:36,791
Explode!

820
00:58:36,875 --> 00:58:39,291
Captain, the eruption is starting.

821
00:58:39,958 --> 00:58:41,041
These chaps were right.

822
00:58:41,125 --> 00:58:42,500
Let's skedaddle!

823
00:58:45,291 --> 00:58:46,500
Hot!

824
00:58:53,375 --> 00:58:54,625
We're trapped!

825
00:58:54,708 --> 00:58:56,333
We've got to rescue them!

826
00:59:08,333 --> 00:59:10,416
Can't get through.

827
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,125
What do we do?

828
00:59:12,208 --> 00:59:14,083
Cap, cover my controls!

829
00:59:14,166 --> 00:59:15,583
Tweak, what are you…

830
00:59:15,666 --> 00:59:18,333
There's one more thing
the Mega GUP-Z can do,

831
00:59:18,416 --> 00:59:20,416
and it just might help us.

832
00:59:21,458 --> 00:59:26,500
Trouble is, I've never tested it.
Never even made a button for it.

833
00:59:26,583 --> 00:59:28,541
Gotta turn it on another way.

834
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:31,708
Oh dear!

835
00:59:31,791 --> 00:59:34,833
Whatever it is, we need it now!

836
00:59:35,416 --> 00:59:36,666
Get ready, Cap!

837
00:59:38,625 --> 00:59:39,708
Tweak, hurry!

838
00:59:42,375 --> 00:59:43,333
Hit that button!

839
00:59:58,708 --> 01:00:01,125
Mantis shrimp mode, go!

840
01:00:05,666 --> 01:00:06,500
Wow!

841
01:00:06,583 --> 01:00:08,166
Mantis shrimp?

842
01:00:09,083 --> 01:00:10,916
Those little mateys are tough!

843
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,875
Tweak, it's perfect!

844
01:00:12,958 --> 01:00:16,333
I see you already got the hang
of the spear claw, Kwazii.

845
01:00:16,416 --> 01:00:21,333
In mantis shrimp mode,
we can spear and hammer the rocks away.

846
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:24,375
Hammer claw, go!

847
01:00:25,958 --> 01:00:27,500
Good one, Peso!

848
01:00:27,583 --> 01:00:30,958
That's how we've got to do this,
as a team!

849
01:00:31,041 --> 01:00:32,708
One little problem, Cap.

850
01:00:32,791 --> 01:00:35,250
Mantis shrimp mode uses a ton of power.

851
01:00:35,333 --> 01:00:39,625
When our power runs out,
the five Z-GUPs will all blast apart.

852
01:00:39,708 --> 01:00:41,666
Then there's no time to lose.

853
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:43,541
Into the volcano.

854
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:53,000
It's getting really hot in here.

855
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:56,416
Sure is.
How about some super heat shields?

856
01:00:58,583 --> 01:00:59,541
Thanks, Tweak.

857
01:01:07,166 --> 01:01:09,541
I can barely see them, Captain.

858
01:01:09,625 --> 01:01:12,125
Activating mantis shrimp vision.

859
01:01:13,083 --> 01:01:15,041
There they are. Straight ahead.

860
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:17,333
Kwazii, incoming!

861
01:01:17,416 --> 01:01:18,250
Got it!

862
01:01:18,833 --> 01:01:19,916
And that!

863
01:01:22,125 --> 01:01:23,875
Peso, behind you!

864
01:01:24,833 --> 01:01:25,791
Got it.

865
01:01:27,958 --> 01:01:31,000
The creatures are just
on the other side of this lava.

866
01:01:31,083 --> 01:01:33,666
Activating mantis leap!

867
01:01:38,458 --> 01:01:40,333
Get us out of here!

868
01:01:41,125 --> 01:01:42,125
Help!

869
01:01:42,208 --> 01:01:44,333
Don't worry. We're here to help.

870
01:01:44,416 --> 01:01:47,041
Octonauts, let's do this.

871
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,875
-All clear.
-Thanks.

872
01:01:53,958 --> 01:01:54,791
Thank you!

873
01:01:54,875 --> 01:01:55,916
Over there, Cap!

874
01:01:58,708 --> 01:01:59,583
We're coming!

875
01:02:17,291 --> 01:02:18,291
Thank you!

876
01:02:20,416 --> 01:02:21,458
I'm stuck!

877
01:02:23,125 --> 01:02:24,333
Don't worry.

878
01:02:25,083 --> 01:02:25,958
There you go!

879
01:02:26,041 --> 01:02:27,375
-Thank you!
-Thanks, Mister!

880
01:02:28,208 --> 01:02:29,041
Oh no!

881
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,333
Let's get out of here!

882
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,125
-Cap!
-Uh-oh!

883
01:02:36,833 --> 01:02:38,416
Oh no! No!

884
01:02:43,541 --> 01:02:46,291
The power warning!
We're running out of time.

885
01:02:50,208 --> 01:02:52,041
Oh no! Help!

886
01:02:52,125 --> 01:02:53,000
Oh no!

887
01:02:53,083 --> 01:02:54,708
A family of sharks!

888
01:02:56,958 --> 01:02:58,791
Hammer claw, go!

889
01:03:02,333 --> 01:03:04,583
Tweak, status report.

890
01:03:04,666 --> 01:03:06,458
Not much power left, Cap.

891
01:03:06,541 --> 01:03:09,125
Dashi, any more creatures to rescue?

892
01:03:09,208 --> 01:03:10,375
All clear, Captain.

893
01:03:10,458 --> 01:03:12,333
We'd better… Hold on.

894
01:03:12,416 --> 01:03:14,625
I’m picking up a few last creatures.

895
01:03:14,708 --> 01:03:16,916
-Up there, on that rock.
-Help us!

896
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,166
They're going to fall into that lava.

897
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:20,416
Oh no, they're not!

898
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:22,916
Shellington! Mantis leap!

899
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:23,875
Aye, Captain!

900
01:03:25,541 --> 01:03:26,541
Gotcha!

901
01:03:35,041 --> 01:03:36,083
Uh-oh.

902
01:03:36,666 --> 01:03:39,375
It feels like this whole place
is about to blow!

903
01:03:39,458 --> 01:03:41,291
Octonauts, let's move out.

904
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,166
Oh no!

905
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:54,875
Captain, down there!

906
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,708
That was some ride!

907
01:04:06,291 --> 01:04:07,875
Just a little further.

908
01:04:09,041 --> 01:04:12,083
Cap, we're almost out
of mantis shrimp power!

909
01:04:12,166 --> 01:04:14,750
We won't make it out
of the volcano in time.

910
01:04:14,833 --> 01:04:16,666
What do we do with these creatures?

911
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:18,416
Yeah, what about us?

912
01:04:21,833 --> 01:04:24,041
Shellington, what's that noise?

913
01:04:24,125 --> 01:04:25,750
Is that…

914
01:04:25,833 --> 01:04:28,291
Yes! The Omura's whale!

915
01:04:28,375 --> 01:04:30,791
Excuse me. Maybe I can help.

916
01:04:32,375 --> 01:04:36,875
Time's up.
We're blasting apart in ten, nine…

917
01:04:36,958 --> 01:04:40,125
I mean… Hey! Toss them over here!

918
01:04:40,208 --> 01:04:41,083
Hang on!

919
01:04:41,166 --> 01:04:44,125
-Six, five…
-Gotcha!

920
01:04:44,208 --> 01:04:45,041
…four,

921
01:04:45,833 --> 01:04:46,791
three,

922
01:04:47,375 --> 01:04:48,375
two,

923
01:04:48,958 --> 01:04:49,833
one!

924
01:05:05,375 --> 01:05:07,166
Well done, Octonauts.

925
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:08,583
We made it.

926
01:05:11,833 --> 01:05:12,875
Tunip says,

927
01:05:12,958 --> 01:05:15,041
"Welcome to your new home."

928
01:05:15,125 --> 01:05:16,833
You'll be nice and safe here.

929
01:05:17,416 --> 01:05:18,500
Wonderful.

930
01:05:23,791 --> 01:05:25,541
Home, sweet home.

931
01:05:26,083 --> 01:05:29,875
Hey. No lava. I like it.

932
01:05:30,375 --> 01:05:33,208
I'll tell you what I'd like. Some dinner.

933
01:05:33,291 --> 01:05:36,125
Dinner? You know what, pal?

934
01:05:36,208 --> 01:05:38,625
That sounds pretty great. Come on.

935
01:05:41,041 --> 01:05:42,583
There you go.

936
01:05:43,166 --> 01:05:44,500
Thank you.

937
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:47,416
Thanks for all your help back there.

938
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,500
I really didn't do much.
Just returning the favor.

939
01:05:51,583 --> 01:05:53,958
After all, in times like this…

940
01:05:54,458 --> 01:05:56,666
We've all got to help each other!

941
01:05:58,041 --> 01:05:59,625
<i>Captain, good news.</i>

942
01:05:59,708 --> 01:06:02,666
What is it, Professor?
Have all the eruptions stopped?

943
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:05,583
<i>Oh, well, yes, actually they have.</i>

944
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,333
<i>The Ring of Fire is returning to normal.</i>

945
01:06:08,416 --> 01:06:11,375
<i>But that's not what I was calling about.</i>

946
01:06:12,666 --> 01:06:14,666
The chinstrap penguin eggs.

947
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:16,291
They're hatching.

948
01:06:16,375 --> 01:06:18,125
Captain, we can't miss this.

949
01:06:18,208 --> 01:06:20,000
But how will we get there in time?

950
01:06:20,083 --> 01:06:22,666
And all the Z-GUPs are out of power.

951
01:06:23,666 --> 01:06:27,541
Don't worry, Dashi.
The Octopod is heading to you.

952
01:06:29,416 --> 01:06:32,208
Right. Now we just need to…

953
01:06:32,958 --> 01:06:33,791
Yes!

954
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,125
Oh dear!

955
01:06:39,041 --> 01:06:40,625
Oh my.

956
01:06:50,541 --> 01:06:52,083
They're so cute.

957
01:06:55,458 --> 01:06:57,208
Just one egg left.

958
01:06:59,625 --> 01:07:02,625
It looks like that little eggy
took a real beating.

959
01:07:02,708 --> 01:07:05,291
I just hope my chick is okay.

960
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,291
Oh dear.

961
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:28,083
My baby!

962
01:07:28,833 --> 01:07:30,000
Hooray!

963
01:07:34,541 --> 01:07:36,666
-Thank you.
<i>-</i>You're welcome.

964
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:40,083
But where are all these penguins
going to live now?

965
01:07:40,166 --> 01:07:42,833
After all, their island
was destroyed, right?

966
01:07:44,375 --> 01:07:47,958
I think the Ring of Fire
might provide us with a solution.

967
01:07:48,958 --> 01:07:54,291
Volcanic eruptions can destroy things,
but they can also create things.

968
01:07:54,375 --> 01:07:56,916
Even new islands.

969
01:08:08,625 --> 01:08:09,750
All right!

970
01:08:11,375 --> 01:08:12,458
Wow!

971
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:19,333
Tunip, this island's perfect
for the chinstrap penguins.

972
01:08:19,416 --> 01:08:23,041
But it's not on any of our maps.
How did you know it was here?

973
01:08:23,125 --> 01:08:24,166
Follow me.

974
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:25,541
Bye!

975
01:08:26,458 --> 01:08:27,333
Bye-bye!

976
01:08:32,625 --> 01:08:33,458
Wow.

977
01:08:34,083 --> 01:08:36,583
This is where the seaweed farm used to be.

978
01:08:37,083 --> 01:08:40,166
The volcano created a whole new island.

979
01:08:41,291 --> 01:08:44,375
We name it "Vegitoa."

980
01:08:45,875 --> 01:08:48,958
Yes. The Vegimals named it "Vegitoa."

981
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:50,500
Vegitoa!

982
01:08:51,666 --> 01:08:52,750
Let's do this!

983
01:08:53,541 --> 01:08:57,000
Come on, Octonauts.
Now that we're all back together again,

984
01:08:57,083 --> 01:09:00,208
it looks like we've got
some seaweed to plant.

985
01:09:15,208 --> 01:09:18,458
You know, Cap,
even though we were apart today,

986
01:09:18,541 --> 01:09:21,500
it still felt like we were
all working as a team.

987
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,666
It did, didn't it?

988
01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:27,166
Yeah. It was almost like you were
right there with us, Captain.

989
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:29,500
But there's just one thing.

990
01:09:29,583 --> 01:09:30,625
Well, what's that?

991
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:35,458
You really<i>, really</i> need to update
those training videos.

992
01:09:35,541 --> 01:09:39,791
<i>Welcome to the Octonauts</i>
<i>video training series, lesson 43:</i>

993
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:41,666
<i>Octo-aerobics.</i>

994
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:46,458
<i>One, two, three, four.</i>

995
01:09:50,625 --> 01:09:54,500
One, two, three, four!
