3
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:24,784
Where's my primer?

4
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,590
Vada, we're late!

5
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,493
-Vada.
-Mmm.

6
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:41,601
-God...

7
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:05,758
Dude,
we are so fucking late!

8
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:07,760
Are the cake pops
different flavors

9
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:09,696
or are they just
different colors?

10
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,131
Different flavors.

11
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:12,699
What are
the flavor differences?

12
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,546
Honestly, it is a miracle
that we made it on time.

13
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,348
Dude, we are killing it!

14
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:29,549
Per ushe, yes.

15
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,151
Also, is it just me
or does coffee

16
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:33,219
immediately make you
have to shit?

17
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,288
-Oh, immediately, yeah.
-Like I smell coffee
and I'm shitting my pants.

18
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:37,790
Pause the shit-talking
till Justin Dragonas passes.

19
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,062
Oh, my God, I want him.

20
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,564
We need to come up with a code
for shitting.

21
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:46,399
You're right!

22
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,067
Alright, let's think.

23
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,069
-Okay, like--
-We can say like
I need to talk to my boss.

24
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,238
-What are you talking about?
-Are you picking
what I'm putting down?

25
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:55,008
It's like, "Okay, I need to
have a long call with my boss

26
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:56,342
and he's mad."

27
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:58,077
Oh my God,
my boss is so mad at me

28
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,312
that I got a penis call
this morning.

29
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:00,680
Oh, and then when you...

30
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,649
It could be like you're texting
your boss.

31
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:04,684
You're texting
your boss. I love it.

32
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,386
-We love that.
-You have to keep it fancy.

33
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,421
We love
to keep it fancy,
that's what we do.

34
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,391
Now that's also a concern
because most of that water
is paleo water.

35
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,860
Dating back to the most rec...
Yes, Vada?

36
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:16,563
Does the kind of rock affect
how long the aquifer last

37
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,331
or how quickly it recharges?

38
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,200
Oh, that's a great question,

39
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,101
but that depends on
many factors.

40
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,703
Anybody wanna guess

41
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,172
what the next biggest
aquifer is?

42
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,440
So we have to think about
what we know

43
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,008
about the aquifers, right?

44
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:32,111
So the Ogallala Aquifer is one
of the largest eight

45
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,113
in the world,
not to... Yes?

46
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,548
I'm sorry,
can I use the restroom?

47
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:36,749
Yes.

48
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:39,118
It dates back
to the recent ice age.

49
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,787
So when we think about that
we have to say, "Wow,

50
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,689
this is one of the largest
in the world."

51
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:45,191
Are you okay?

52
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,793
-No.
-What happened?

53
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,297
I don't want anyone to hear me.

54
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,033
Dude, literally just tell me,
you're freaking me out.

55
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,637
I got my...

56
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:01,541
What? I can't hear you.

57
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,076
I'll just text it to you.

58
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,118
Jesus, Amelia!

59
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:17,457
You don't text 911
when you get your period!

60
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:20,226
You scared the shit
out of me. Oh my God!

61
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,462
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,467
It's okay.

63
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:32,005
Wait, haven't you been dyin'
to get your period
for like a year?

64
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,306
I thought you'd be stoked.

65
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,075
It's different than I thought.

66
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:38,011
Oh, you mean shitty as hell?
Yeah, I know.

67
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,146
You're the worst.
I'm hanging up now.

68
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:42,582
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,083
Do you, um...

70
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,688
have everything you need?

71
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:52,692
Yeah, I stole it from your room
a few months ago.

72
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,327
It's in my backpack.

73
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,030
Just in case.

74
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,665
I was just gonna
tell you to stuff a bunch
of toilet paper

75
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,133
in your pants till
you get home,

76
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,836
but that...
That's some pro-level shit.

77
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,039
Nice move!

78
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,307
Oh, my God.

79
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,209
How about this?

80
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,045
Let's go to dinner tonight,
just you and I, okay?

81
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,546
And I will fill you in

82
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:18,951
on all the bloody, chunky,
gooey, goopy details.

83
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:20,553
Ew, shut up.

84
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,654
I love ya.

85
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:23,956
Congratulations.

86
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:26,025
Don't say congrats, you freak.

87
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:31,898
I love you, too.

88
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:51,651
Photo day.

89
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,487
Better get my shit together.

90
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:53,746
You don't even need
to wear makeup.

91
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:55,948
Sorry, what?

92
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,619
I just said, "You don't even
need to wear makeup."

93
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,622
-I...

94
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:05,825
-What was that?

95
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,427
-Come on, come on!

96
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:09,295
-Was that a gun?
-Get down!

97
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,267
Take 'em off!

98
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:16,469
No! Oh!

99
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,853
We're gonna die.

100
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,289
Go, go, go, go, go!

101
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:53,139
Oh my God. Oh my God.

102
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,342
Is it over?

103
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,377
Is it over?

104
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,721
Who's in there?

105
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,225
I'm not the shooter.
It's Matt Corgan, I saw him.

106
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:16,395
Do you know where he is now?

107
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,997
I don't know, I don't know.

108
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,834
My brother.

109
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,503
Come, come under. Just...

110
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:35,348
Oh, fuck, are you shot?

111
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,018
My brother.

112
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,778
You! Drop your weapon!

113
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,513
Drop your weapon now!

114
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,019
Down on the ground!

115
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,655
Maybe we should
wake her up.

116
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,557
She needs to rest.

117
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:53,225
I just wanna
talk to her.

118
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:30,196
Did you know him?

119
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:34,667
He follows you on Instagram,
so he knew you.

120
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:38,838
It's like on every channel.

121
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:41,307
Like CNN was interviewing
your friend Melody.

122
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:42,975
So crazy.

123
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,012
Did you know anyone who died?

124
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:47,613
-Amelia.
-What?

125
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,349
Is there like a list
or something?

126
00:10:56,689 --> 00:11:00,226
Sometimes, I'm just like,
"What year are we living in?"

127
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,062
I'm literally gonna Amazon
a bulletproof backpack.

128
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,563
Amelia!

129
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,665
What?

130
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,571
Please don't cry, Mom.

131
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:14,974
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.

132
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,593
Do you need something?

133
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,264
Was just gonna take a bath.

134
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:40,566
Okay

135
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,271
Okay.

136
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:17,656
Fuck.

137
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,489
I'm glad
you're going to see Nick.

138
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,758
How's he holding up?

139
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:01,760
I think okay.

140
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:03,662
Good!

141
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:05,664
Good.

142
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,173
What about you?
How... How are you feeling?

143
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:24,683
Better.

144
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:28,053
That's good,
so good.

145
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,155
I'm really so glad
to hear that.

146
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,798
I literally thought
it was a drill

147
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:41,567
'cause Cambie had us locked in,

148
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,068
shades over the window
in like two seconds,

149
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,237
so I was like, "Okay, clearly,
this is a drill."

150
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,505
-Right?
-Yeah.

151
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:47,906
And Olivia Metis is
like talking,

152
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,908
you know, being annoying,
and Cambie goes

153
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,245
-"Olivia, be fucking quiet."
-No.

154
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,247
And we're all like, "Oh shit.

155
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,149
Like this is real deal,
no joke."

156
00:16:57,216 --> 00:17:00,085
It's just so...
It's so fucked.

157
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,254
I can't stop hearing
the sound of it.

158
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,428
So last night,
I was like, "Okay,

159
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,230
why did I survive?

160
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,499
Like out of everyone,
like why me?

161
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:16,168
Is it so that
I can do something

162
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,904
to like make this
never happen again?"

163
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,672
Hmm.

164
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,508
So, I set up this Zoom
with Everytown

165
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:24,276
and we're gonna talk
about like

166
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,278
how to be more reactive,
how to start a movement,

167
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,746
how to get
a fuckin' bill passed.

168
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:28,914
Like something.

169
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,922
Why do you think he did it?

170
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,960
I don't know,
is there like ever a reason?

171
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,367
After initial reports
of a shooter,

172
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:49,902
officers surrounded
the campus,

173
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:51,737
directing the evacuation
of hundreds

174
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,372
of students from the scene.

175
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:54,606
This tragedy is.

176
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:56,742
I think Anderson Cooper
is cute.

177
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:57,976
We've been
on the scene.

178
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,945
He is. Don't get too attached.

179
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:36,515
Disturbing videos
from the students' cellphones

180
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:44,523
In the video, gunshots can be
heard in the hall,

181
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,593
answered by children screaming
in their classrooms...

182
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,294
I'm gonna go to Nick's.

183
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:50,863
Uh, okay.

184
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,464
...during the escape,
children fled the building.

185
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,068
Hey.

186
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,170
Hey.

187
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,839
Wanna come in?

188
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:39,912
Thank you.

189
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,484
Want some water or somethin'?

190
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:48,353
Okay.

191
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:56,762
You have a really nice house.

192
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,330
Thanks.

193
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:01,500
Really nice, it's a cool vibe,
with the wood and uh...

194
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:04,269
You have a lot
of cool art here, too.

195
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:07,172
Yeah, uh, my dads
are artists, so...

196
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:09,875
-Your parents are artists?
-Yeah.

197
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,878
That is so cool.

198
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:15,781
It all makes sense now.

199
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,683
Do you know
when they'll be back?

200
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,019
I'm actually not really sure.

201
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:23,088
Yeah, they're gone
like all the time.

202
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:30,462
Uh, I have to be honest
with you,

203
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,097
'cause if I'm not then

204
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:34,233
I'll probably feel really bad
about it.

205
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:36,568
But I watched some of...
Thank you.

206
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:40,105
Some of your dance videos
on Instagram.

207
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:43,609
In the videos, you come off
like, so like hard.

208
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,410
And whatever.

209
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:47,546
What I'm tryin' to say
is you're a completely
different person

210
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,982
when you're dancing
and in real life,

211
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,283
you're like so different.

212
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,385
Yeah, I don't know why
I'm like that.

213
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,487
It's like... Yeah.

214
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,924
It's cool though that you're
able to like just switch into

215
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,259
a different mode.

216
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:01,493
Like I could never
do something like that.

217
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:02,761
It's dope.

218
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:07,499
Thank you.

219
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,435
Yeah.

220
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:16,408
Is that...
Is that wine okay for you?

221
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:18,010
Oh, yeah, no, it's so good.

222
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,678
Are you sure?
I have like
a couple of others--

223
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:20,979
No, it's... Yeah...

224
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,849
That's like the best one
I've ever had, so.

225
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:24,983
Okay.

226
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:32,858
-I'm sorry, I'm gonna--
-Oh.

227
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,327
I'll turn this off,
my mom keeps
checking in on me.

228
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:37,129
Okay.

229
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,365
Nick told me that

230
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:43,502
Quinton's brother's service
is tomorrow.

231
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:45,304
Already? That's--

232
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,972
-Yeah, I--
-That's great.

233
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:51,109
I guess some religions
do them fast.

234
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:52,377
I was thinkin' about going.

235
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,645
Do you think
that would be weird?

236
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:56,048
No. No, I don't...
I don't think so.

237
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,518
Okay.

238
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:03,121
I mean, I can,
like, come with you
if you want.

239
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:04,656
Yeah, no, I--

240
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:07,392
-Yeah, I want... Yeah.
-Yeah, if you...

241
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:10,295
Um, yeah.
If that's cool with you, so...

242
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:14,032
-Yeah, let's do it.
-Cool.

243
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,971
Can I ask you a question?

244
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:21,006
Mmm-hmm.

245
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:27,412
Did you have like

246
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,481
the craziest nightmares
last night?

247
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,219
You have to be able to sleep
to have nightmares.

248
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:55,273
Hey.

249
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,441
-Hey.
-Hey.

250
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,211
Uh, thank you for coming.

251
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:01,413
Of course.

252
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:48,553
Do you wanna go to Starbucks?

253
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:49,621
No.

254
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:52,057
Do you want a Starbucks?

255
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:54,292
Mmm, no.

256
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:56,828
Okay.

257
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:08,907
I'm literally gonna
make Mom get me something
with caffeine .

258
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,695
I only do that when I play
with my little dinosaur.

259
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,266
Do the cat pitch.

260
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,401
Never again.

261
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:41,773
I only do that when I play
with my little dinosaur.

262
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:45,277
Do the cat pitch.

263
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:47,779
Never again.

264
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:54,219
Are you hungry?

265
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:02,761
-That's really good.
-Mmm.

266
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:04,462
I'm spilling it everywhere.

267
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,365
It is really good.

268
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,636
Are your dads really chill?

269
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,109
They travel a lot though, huh?

270
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:19,444
Mostly, Europe.

271
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:21,413
For like fun?

272
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:24,149
Work.

273
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,784
Do they send people
to spy on you

274
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:29,087
or they trust you just to not
throw a bunch of ragers.

275
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:35,927
I mean, they know I'm not
like a rager person, so.

276
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:38,797
Who do you hang out
with at school?

277
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:40,899
Like...

278
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,302
Like different people.

279
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,172
Like a bunch
of different people, so.

280
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,809
I'm gone a lot with dance.

281
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:52,978
How often do you dance?

282
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,480
Every day.

283
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,815
Like classes?

284
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:58,083
Mmm-hmm.

285
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:02,320
But I haven't gone

286
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,156
since the thing.

287
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,832
Are your parents chill?

288
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:19,037
My dad more than my mom,
for sure.

289
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:22,474
-My mom's like
very white and anxious.

290
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:26,344
I don't really tell 'em
anything though, 'cause like

291
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:28,113
they worry.

292
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,818
I feel kinda bad for it.
They're actually
really good parents.

293
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,659
I see you're packing
for a trip.

294
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:41,993
What's your favorite
country to visit?

295
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,294
Paris.

296
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:45,063
What's the last country
you visited?

297
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,498
Europe.

298
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:48,066
What country
do you wish to visit?

299
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,300
Persia.

300
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:53,571
What's the weirdest word
in the English language?

301
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,974
Moist. Yuck.

302
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:57,409
When was
the last time you cried?

303
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:02,414
Can you stay?

304
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:06,718
It's late.

305
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,354
Just till I fall asleep.

306
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:14,859
Okay.

307
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,928
Thanks.

308
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,069
What's your
favorite movie?

309
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:25,103
Mmm, Pizza.

310
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,038
Favorite TV show?

311
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:29,240
Um, I would have
to say my pilot
with Kate Berlant

312
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,209
that was passed on
by every major network
and streaming platform.

313
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:33,378
Meanwhile, rapists everywhere
continue to freely make up 10.

314
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:34,713
What up, bitch?

315
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:36,948
Dude, I'm so sorry I missed
the march.

316
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:40,218
I mean, it's fine.
I was just, like,
legit worried about you.

317
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:42,087
It was cool, though.
They let me speak.

318
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:44,956
I wish you'd been there,
but it's fine,
I'll send you a link.

319
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,592
I know, I'm sorry.
I just...

320
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:50,295
It's a long story,
but I ended up goin' to
Mia's house and--

321
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,263
Wait, lol, Mia Reed?

322
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:54,265
What?

323
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:55,700
Yeah.

324
00:28:55,767 --> 00:29:00,071
She... She's just been alone
and I feel bad.

325
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:04,109
-So I just--
-No, no, no, I mean, it's fine.
It's just like random.

326
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:05,376
Is she okay?

327
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:06,911
I mean, she will be.

328
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,115
Are you okay?

329
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:11,149
Yeah.

330
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,218
Just tired.

331
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,923
We wanna
know how a 16-year-old
can have access

332
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:22,327
to a military assault rifle
and that's considered okay?

333
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,329
-It's not okay!

334
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,231
We want change.

335
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:29,400
We deserve to feel safe
going to our own school
every day...

336
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:55,860
It feels like so soon.
It's been like two weeks.

337
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,295
No, I hear you.

338
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:58,997
It's... It's intense,
but I just...

339
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:01,766
I don't want us to be ruled
by fear, you know?

340
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:03,668
I feel like it'll be less scary
if we were together.

341
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:04,936
I gotta go.

342
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:06,004
Okay, love you. Call me later.

343
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:07,539
Hey! Honey, can I come in?

344
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,841
You don't have to ask
to come in, Mom.

345
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:12,377
Okay.

346
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:16,481
So it sounds like Nick's going
back today, huh?

347
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:19,717
Yup. He is.

348
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,719
Well...

349
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,688
Well, as long
as you wanna stay home,

350
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:28,059
you know,
your dad and I support that.

351
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,127
Thank you.

352
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,733
There's just one thing.

353
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:44,209
Were you tired a lot
before the incident?

354
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:48,580
LOL.

355
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,350
You called it "the incident".

356
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:54,686
Um...

357
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:57,388
No, I guess I'm just
always tired.

358
00:30:57,488 --> 00:30:59,657
I mean, I guess, that's what
caffeine is for.

359
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:00,925
Right?

360
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,929
What do you do
when you get tired?

361
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,498
Sleep for like
14 hours straight.

362
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:09,868
Ooh, I really like watching
early seasons

363
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:11,002
of the  Kardashians.

364
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:12,837
The OG Hidden Hills shit.

365
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:15,940
That is my vibe!

366
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:26,284
What's this, you're just
gonna fax that
to my mom or...

367
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,720
-Fax?
-Yes. Fax.

368
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:31,256
What are you, a time traveler
from the '80s?

369
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:36,394
I mean,
I had my suspicions when
I saw those sneakers,

370
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:38,963
but now I'm pretty convinced.

371
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,865
Touche.

372
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:42,901
Touche.

373
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:46,571
Look, I know this whole
therapy thing is weird

374
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:48,072
and can be uncomfortable.

375
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:50,208
But everything that you say
in here is confidential.

376
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:53,211
And, side note, I actually do
really like your shoes.

377
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:55,113
They're very cool.

378
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:57,782
No, I know. Thank you.

379
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:01,386
Are there things that you don't
feel comfortable talking

380
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:05,123
to your parents about
that maybe you wanna
share with me?

381
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,163
Yeah.

382
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:16,167
My porn addiction.

383
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,102
Okay.

384
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:21,639
I'm so sorry. I'm...

385
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:23,241
When I get nervous,

386
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:25,510
I make really inappropriate
jokes, so, my bad.

387
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,645
You don't have to be sorry.

388
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:29,414
And you don't
have to be nervous.

389
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:34,419
Well, I know that my parents
are worried about me

390
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:36,754
and they think I need help.

391
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:39,624
But I get it,
and that's fine,

392
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:42,193
but I personally am fine.

393
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:45,930
Like I feel like
I'm really good
at managing my emotions.

394
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:47,031
It's...

395
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,834
What do you mean by that?

396
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:53,705
I'm just very chill.

397
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,873
Like a very low-key person.

398
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:59,644
So when it comes
to emotional stuff
or drama I'm like

399
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:03,014
"Okay, is this
really productive?"

400
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,617
Yeah. I get it.

401
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:08,820
But you know, just because--

402
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:12,323
It doesn't necessarily mean
that someone's
being dramatic

403
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,726
because they're emotional.

404
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,194
You know, for a lot of people,

405
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:17,795
they need to fully experience
their emotions,

406
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:20,131
in order to process
what they've been through,

407
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:22,400
so that they can begin to heal.

408
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,169
It's actually really healthy
to show your emotion.

409
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:34,746
I know most people
come in here crying

410
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,414
about their cheating husbands.

411
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,483
Vada, I wanna talk about you.

412
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,086
I wanna know
how that shooting
at your school

413
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,554
has made you feel.

414
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:49,727
I feel...

415
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,769
It's okay.

416
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,203
I mean, it makes sense.

417
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:05,076
I want you to track
how you're feeling

418
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:07,378
using this worksheet.

419
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:09,280
So there's questions on there
that'll guide you.

420
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,782
You don't have to overthink it,

421
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,683
it's just basically there to
hold space for you to...

422
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:16,220
To understand whatever
emotions may come up.

423
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,524
All you have to do
is try and feel.

424
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,725
That's it.

425
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:22,860
No matter what
those feelings are.

426
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:26,197
Then you can bring it back
next session and we'll
go through it.

427
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:28,065
Or you know,
you can fax it to me!

428
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:29,300
If that's easier for you.

429
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:37,575
She said
you were incredibly bright,
and smart, and funny.

430
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:39,944
Wait,
is she in love with me?

431
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:41,813
Oh, what's the point of
goin' to therapy,

432
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,981
if they're just gonna tell
their parents everything
they said after?

433
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:45,716
Honey, she didn't
tell me anything.

434
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:47,985
She gave me
a general assessment
of how the session went.

435
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:50,054
-That's all.
-She thought
you were doing really well,

436
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:51,489
considering what you
went through.

437
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,324
-Excuse me?
-Amelia!

438
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:56,727
She was on speakerphone.
It's not like I was
trying to listen.

439
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:57,895
I'm sorry.

440
00:34:57,962 --> 00:34:59,764
Whatever. Do I need
to go again?

441
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:01,933
Because it sounds like
she thinks everything is fine.

442
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:03,634
Well,
I don't know, honey.

443
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:06,304
I mean, do you think you're
ready to go back to school?

444
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,576
-Aren't you coming with us?
-No.

445
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:13,010
Well, I don't know
what you want.

446
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,846
-I don't know, turkey.
-Toasted?

447
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,647
I don't care, Mom!

448
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:12,863
We won't live our lives scared
to go to school every day.

449
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,299
We can't accept a world
in which the federal government

450
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,535
thinks American
high school students
getting gunned down

451
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:19,904
in their classrooms
isn't a priority.

452
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:23,140
We won't accept
that our leaders have NRA money
in their pockets

453
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,443
and our blood
on their hands.

454
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:27,111
We want real change.

455
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:29,280
We want real leadership,
honest politics that make

456
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,950
our schools a safe place
for us to learn and grow.

457
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,485
And we want it
before it's too late.

458
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,820
Can I have some wine?

459
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,388
That was Nick Feinstein,

460
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:38,756
one of the several
surviving students.

461
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,082
Does it get stuck
on your fingers?

462
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:07,652
Yeah.

463
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:10,588
I don't know,
it's gonna be good, you know?

464
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:15,626
-You just gotta get in it,
you know?
-Yeah, like that?

465
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:21,098
-It's the shoulders.
-It's all in the shoulders.

466
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:23,334
-Like you can't do it
without the shoulders.
-Okay, my bad.

467
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:27,371
I feel like that felt right.

468
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,307
-Yeah. Yeah, I think so.
-Like now it feels ready.

469
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:31,275
-I think if you did it anymore,
it'd be overkill.
-Okay. Okay.

470
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,151
Oh, where did it go?

471
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:42,987
It wasn't enough.

472
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:45,356
No, you definitely have to
grind it way more.

473
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:46,824
I need more?

474
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:48,959
Little more.

475
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:52,496
Ooh, yeah.
Stoner vibes.

476
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:53,731
It's gonna be good.

477
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,166
-So good?
-So good.

478
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,400
Can't wait?

479
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,335
Can't wait.
Are you getting pumped?

480
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:59,737
Go! Go! Go! Go!

481
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,238
This is it.

482
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,643
-Ooh.
-Look at us.

483
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,878
-Who'd have thought?
-Who'd have thought?

484
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:09,980
That is fat.

485
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:11,816
Why do you trust me?

486
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:14,985
'Cause you've smoked before.

487
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:18,255
-Okay. Not like too much.
-It's so thick.

488
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:22,393
Is it ever too much?

489
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:25,396
-We'll find out.
-Stoner thoughts.

490
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:27,865
-Hey, did you just say
"stoner thoughts"?
-Yes, I did!

491
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:33,070
Oh!

492
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:36,273
It's kinda thick.

493
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:39,677
-Curvy queen.
So beautiful!
-She has curves.

494
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:41,078
-Holy, how do I?--
-Do the honors.

495
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:42,947
-No, just... Just... No.
-Do I--

496
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,682
Is this cigarette
or is it like this?

497
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:46,117
-Cigarette? Weed?
-You choose.

498
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,752
-Weed? Cigarette? Weed?
-You choose. You choose.

499
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,955
Wait, other--

500
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,923
Oh!

501
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:57,094
Okay. This is it.

502
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:03,601
Yo, it has gotten
so bad though,
like so bad,

503
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:06,237
to the point where they're
cutting the elephant tusks off

504
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:07,471
before they release them,

505
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:08,939
so like the poachers
can't kill them.

506
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,741
So, it's like,
"Okay, they don't have tusks,

507
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:12,877
but like at least,
they're alive." You know?

508
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:15,045
It's so messed up!

509
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:17,448
No, and then it makes me think
about the uh, what's his name?

510
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:19,316
The Jimmy John's founder?

511
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,285
Apparently, he's like
some trophy hunter.

512
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:23,120
But the thing about that one is
like I don't know

513
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,922
if I have the right to be mad
about that,

514
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:26,457
'cause I don't know
if it's true or not.

515
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:29,126
So every time I see it,
I'm like, "Is this real?

516
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:30,461
Or is it like this fake news?"

517
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:35,232
Like, "Can I trust this meme?"

518
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:38,436
Can you be honest with me
for like 2.5 seconds?

519
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:41,672
-Am I being annoying?

520
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,174
Because personally for me,
I feel like this weed

521
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,942
is making me
a little bit chatty.

522
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:48,145
Like I don't even feel sad
at this point, I'm just chatty.

523
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:50,481
I don't know, is that bad?
What about you,
what do you feel?

524
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:53,984
I feel chill.

525
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:57,521
You always feel chill.

526
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,364
I feel nothing.

527
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:12,036
-Fuck!

528
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:24,782
-I hate weed.

529
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:33,457
I hope that's not your dinner.

530
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:34,892
Yup.

531
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,293
Ew, Vada.

532
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:39,063
Where's your sister?

533
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:43,067
Um, filming a nighttime routine
for her YouTube channel.

534
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,568
Don't ask.

535
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,971
Do you think we should take her
phone away?

536
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:50,374
No, but you should probably get
that app where you can see
everything she does online.

537
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:52,510
That exists?
Who knew!

538
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:55,746
Wow, where we'd be without you?

539
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:04,755
So Vada, honey, I was um...

540
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,490
I wanted to talk to you
about school.

541
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:11,896
What's up?

542
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:13,831
Well, I don't
want you to fall
too far behind.

543
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:15,099
I won't.

544
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,600
Well,
you can't stay home forever.

545
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,537
Why not?

546
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:22,006
Sure, I just think that
the longer you stay home,

547
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:26,210
the harder it's gonna be
for you to go back.

548
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:28,712
All...

549
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:31,515
All I want is what's best
for you.

550
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:34,184
I wanna see that sparkle back.

551
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,592
You know,
Amelia got her period.

552
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:43,394
What?

553
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,064
-When?
-Forever ago.

554
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:49,366
Guess she just didn't
want you to know.

555
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:02,313
My mom's tryin' to make me go
back to school.

556
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,649
Fuck.

557
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,084
When are you gonna go back?

558
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:10,588
I don't know.

559
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:12,623
My dads said I could
do homeschooling
as long as I want.

560
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:16,226
Lucky you.

561
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,132
I'm gonna try
and get some sleep.

562
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:23,434
Goodnight.

563
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:26,337
Night!

564
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:48,826
Get out of the building and far
away from it as you can.

565
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:50,828
Next, you need to find...

566
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:03,474
Always remember
these three things.

567
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,874
That should
be enough for today.

568
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:39,643
You can basically just review
your notes for the test.

569
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:42,980
Again, if I've talked about it,
it'll be on the test.

570
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:44,415
And guys, remember, I said,

571
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:45,916
"No phones
during classes, please."

572
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,110
Shit.

573
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:17,081
Oh, you bitch.

574
00:45:18,615 --> 00:45:21,118
You dumb fucking bitch.

575
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,256
It was a fucking soda can!

576
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:30,928
Dumb fucking stupid--

577
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:33,697
So today at PE,
Jack Booth was whopping
the beanbag

578
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:36,066
and one hit me in the forearm,
and the PE teacher saw it,

579
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:37,735
and didn't say one word.

580
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:39,436
And I was like, "Okay, you're
terrible at about your job."

581
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:41,805
I'm sure he's not terrible
at his job, Amelia.

582
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:44,074
Dad, he's protected
by union and tenure.

583
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:46,810
That's the only reason
he's still there.

584
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,312
How about you, Vada?
How was...

585
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:49,613
How was your first day back?

586
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:55,586
Just low-key.

587
00:45:55,652 --> 00:45:58,255
So, is everyone
settling in okay?

588
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:01,892
I don't know,
it's... It's heavy,
but I think everybody's

589
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:03,727
just tryin' to move on.

590
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:07,431
Good. That's good.
I'm so glad.

591
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:10,167
Yeah, it's amazing.

592
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:11,802
Ugh, I'm so full.

593
00:46:11,902 --> 00:46:12,836
Finish your salad.

594
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:15,472
It's wilted.

595
00:46:15,572 --> 00:46:17,274
It's good for you.
Finish it.

596
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:20,577
I just
can't do arugula, Dad.
It's the texture!

597
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:33,290
Hey.

598
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:37,027
Uh, hey.

599
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,197
Do you have any E?

600
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:43,200
Uh, what?

601
00:46:47,871 --> 00:46:49,273
How much do you want?

602
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,222
There's gonna be
a quiz, okay? Um...

603
00:48:14,424 --> 00:48:16,927
May I go to the restroom?

604
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:18,061
Sure.

605
00:48:20,264 --> 00:48:22,232
Okay,
so make sure that you
are studying.

606
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:23,800
You have to know the difference

607
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:26,637
I'm not gonna help you on this
when you have a pop...

608
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:29,907
quiz for this on Friday.

609
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:54,765
-Nick.

610
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:43,613
Vada, Vada!

611
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,881
Oh my God, Vada! Hey!

612
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:46,883
Hey, hey, hey!
Vada, what'd you take?

613
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:49,052
I hate it here.

614
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:51,655
Vada, what're you doing?
Hey, what'd you take?

615
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:53,290
Hey, what's on your face?
Vada, come on!

616
00:49:53,357 --> 00:49:54,524
Spaghetti.

617
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:55,726
No.

618
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:56,893
Hey, you need
to get your shit together

619
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:58,161
before someone sees you.
Come on!

620
00:49:58,228 --> 00:50:00,530
Ready? We're going.
We're going!

621
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:02,733
We're going, okay.

622
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,537
Is it at least a good high?

623
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:13,744
Is that an elbow?

624
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,183
Why's your mouth
all blue?

625
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:22,652
Jesus, Millie,
what do you want?

626
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:26,156
A pen exploded in my mouth.

627
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:27,824
Oh, that happened
to me once, too,

628
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:28,992
but like it was a marker.

629
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:30,260
Good story, what do you want?

630
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,196
Nothing.

631
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:54,117
Mmm.

632
00:50:59,856 --> 00:51:01,858
Ugh.

633
00:51:09,766 --> 00:51:11,568
Motherfucker.

634
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:13,970
Shit.

635
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:22,279
Oh,
okay, so I guess
you weren't playing.

636
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:23,780
What does that mean?

637
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,782
Let me read you this text.

638
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:29,152
"Uh, Q, I did drugs,"
with a Z, by the way.

639
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:31,555
That was the Z
on the drugs.

640
00:51:31,621 --> 00:51:34,724
Uh, "And I'm YOLOing hard.
Hit me up, honey.

641
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:36,326
Let's party."

642
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:40,664
And then you did this emoji,
and then this emoji,

643
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:42,265
and then a hockey stick.

644
00:51:42,332 --> 00:51:44,734
You just spammed, uh,
spammed emojis.

645
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:46,269
No, I did not.

646
00:51:46,336 --> 00:51:48,171
Yeah,
yeah, you did.

647
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:50,474
But uh, now why'd
you do the drugs,
uh, with the Z?

648
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:55,812
Dude, I literally don't know,
so what had happened was...

649
00:51:55,912 --> 00:51:58,014
Is, um...

650
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:02,652
I was walking
past Dan Bonavure,
and I was like, "Okay,

651
00:52:02,752 --> 00:52:05,655
I know he's a dealer.
I know he has E.

652
00:52:05,755 --> 00:52:07,524
I'm gonna take some like
right now."

653
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,426
Oh shit, okay.
Uh, and how're...

654
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:11,595
How're you feelin' now?

655
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:13,330
To be determined.

656
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:16,099
Well, I'm here if you need me.

657
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:17,334
Um...

658
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:21,171
What are you doing later?

659
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:23,507
'Cause I was just
gonna be low-key

660
00:52:23,607 --> 00:52:24,608
and like watch a movie
or something.

661
00:52:24,674 --> 00:52:25,775
You should come by.

662
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:28,145
Okay. And I'll
bring the acid.

663
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:29,112
Goodbye.

664
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,786
So is he
your boyfriend?

665
00:52:36,853 --> 00:52:38,121
What are you making?

666
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:40,657
Slime. And don't
avoid the question.

667
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:42,192
This is way too juicy.

668
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:43,994
You've literally never
had a boy over

669
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:45,462
that was straight before.

670
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:46,963
Oh, sorry, sorry.

671
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,665
I shouldn't assume
his sexual orientation.

672
00:52:48,732 --> 00:52:50,400
So like how does he identify?

673
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,302
You're asking
way too many questions.

674
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:55,405
Vada, you are gonna stay
in the living room, right?

675
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:57,741
No, I was thinking
we're gonna snuggle
in the dark in my room.

676
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:58,909
Yes, Mom!

677
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,744
I was just asking.

678
00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:04,247
Please don't embarrass me.

679
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:07,384
I'm serious, Amelia.
Oh my God.

680
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,821
No!
No, no, no, don't go
in the river!

681
00:53:11,888 --> 00:53:13,657
-Why is he going in the river?
-I don't know.

682
00:53:13,723 --> 00:53:16,193
This is the saddest shit
I have ever seen in my life.

683
00:53:16,259 --> 00:53:17,761
This is terrible!

684
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:20,430
This is so bad!
Why would they
let kids watch this?

685
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,199
Yeah, you said
you wanted to watch this.

686
00:53:22,265 --> 00:53:23,767
-I cannot... You picked this.
-You said this was your fa--

687
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:25,669
I gave you options.
I gave you options--

688
00:53:25,735 --> 00:53:27,037
-Come on.
-And you chose this one.

689
00:53:27,103 --> 00:53:27,737
What are you guys
laughing at?

690
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:31,675
Amelia!

691
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:33,510
Sorry, sorry!

692
00:53:33,577 --> 00:53:35,779
I just wanted to let you guys
know that the slime
is almost ready.

693
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,280
If you wanna try it,
I'll allow it.

694
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,848
I love slime. I wanna try.

695
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:40,417
Okay! Do you want blue or red?

696
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:41,618
Blue, please.

697
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,286
Vada?

698
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:46,189
I don't...
Red. I don't care.

699
00:53:46,256 --> 00:53:47,591
Coming right up!

700
00:53:50,093 --> 00:53:51,528
I am so sorry.

701
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:53,363
She's so cute.

702
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:55,065
Do you wanna watch
The Staircase?

703
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:56,800
-Do you know what that is?
-No, what's  The Staircase?

704
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,768
It's this white guy,
who murders
his second wife,

705
00:53:58,868 --> 00:54:01,404
and probably his first wife,
and gets away with both.

706
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,473
Oh, a tale as old as time.

707
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:04,808
Tale as old as time, really?

708
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,309
Yeah.

709
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:08,144
Wait, no, have you seen
the memes of like you know,

710
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:10,080
all these women are obsessed
with these murder docs,

711
00:54:10,146 --> 00:54:12,449
people have
like taken these photos
of the Stepford Wives

712
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:14,150
you know, with the smile,
with the knife?

713
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:15,585
-It's like--
-Nah, I haven't seen--

714
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:17,621
Uh, and it says,
"Murder me, Daddy."

715
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:18,722
Nah, I haven't seen that.

716
00:54:18,788 --> 00:54:20,090
You've never seen that?

717
00:54:20,156 --> 00:54:22,926
It's everywhere.
Check your timeline, dude.

718
00:54:24,794 --> 00:54:26,263
It's really funny.

719
00:54:30,967 --> 00:54:32,269
Everything okay?

720
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:36,239
Is everything alright?

721
00:54:36,306 --> 00:54:38,441
Yeah, uh, I'm sorry.

722
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:40,443
I just have to go home
right now.

723
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:44,314
I'm sorry, but you know, uh,
family stuff.

724
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:47,817
Yeah, don't even apologize.
That's totally fine.

725
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:52,689
Yeah, um, honestly,
I just can't believe that

726
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:56,192
you're gonna leave alone
to watch this cat flow down
the river all by myself.

727
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:57,627
Oh, you're actually
gonna finish it?

728
00:54:57,694 --> 00:54:59,262
I have to!
I have to see what happens!

729
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:03,633
Okay, well, uh, text me
and let me know,

730
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:04,634
you know, what happens.

731
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:10,440
I hope everything's okay
at home.

732
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:12,175
You know how it is.

733
00:55:12,709 --> 00:55:13,943
Yeah.

734
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:16,713
I'll see you.

735
00:55:35,198 --> 00:55:37,567
No, no, no, no, no

736
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:39,202
-You don't trust me?
-No!

737
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:40,904
-You don't trust me?
-No, mom!

738
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:42,639
-You don't trust me?
-Oh my God.

739
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:44,074
-You don't trust me?
-Stop! Stop!

740
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,342
No, now let me see
which one you have.

741
00:55:45,408 --> 00:55:46,543
-No, no, no, no, no, no.
-Stop!

742
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:49,079
Stop.

743
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:50,380
-But this one, I heard
this would be better.
-That smells like strawberries.

744
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,848
No, that's too--

745
00:55:51,915 --> 00:55:53,416
No, smell, smell.
Smell, smell. Smell.

746
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:55,151
Oh! Ew!

747
00:55:55,218 --> 00:55:57,587
-Disgusting,
I know. Oh God!
-You're so bad.

748
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:01,725
This one does
smell good, though.

749
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:04,527
Just take a little sniff.
Come on.

750
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:12,602
-Ow, Jesus!

751
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:15,004
-V!
-What?

752
00:56:15,071 --> 00:56:17,173
-Let me in!
-No.

753
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,209
You never
lock the door. What are
you doing in there?

754
00:56:19,275 --> 00:56:20,510
None of your business!

755
00:56:46,202 --> 00:56:48,271
Are you wearing my lipstick?

756
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:49,973
What? No.

757
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,275
Can you tell Mom
I don't need a ride?
Nick's gonna take me.

758
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:54,911
Only if you tell me why you're
wearing my lipstick.

759
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:58,415
I think those fake glasses
are messing with
your vision, dude.

760
00:56:58,481 --> 00:57:00,750
Well, you know, everyone wears
fake glasses now.

761
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:02,419
It's socially acceptable!

762
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,089
Okay, wait,
serious question.

763
00:57:06,156 --> 00:57:07,323
Okay.

764
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:10,593
Now Drake?
Degrassi  Drake? Choose.

765
00:57:11,494 --> 00:57:12,429
I like wheelchair Drake.

766
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:14,731
Wheelchair Jimmy!

767
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:16,833
-Jimmy!
-Jimmy!

768
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:18,968
Jimmy!

769
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,110
You're, like, yodeling.

770
00:57:27,177 --> 00:57:28,912
You probably
didn't know this about me,

771
00:57:28,978 --> 00:57:30,680
but I'm the best yodeler
in my family.

772
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:31,915
Prove it!

773
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:34,350
You can't put me
on the spot like that,

774
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:35,685
'cause then that's just like,
you know...

775
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:37,153
This is like
a little preview.

776
00:57:37,253 --> 00:57:38,955
-Yeah, this is like warm-up.
-Okay.

777
00:57:39,022 --> 00:57:41,324
You know, but I'm gonna get you
when you're not even ready.

778
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:44,127
And you're gonna
be like...

779
00:57:46,262 --> 00:57:48,765
Hey, you know,
this might sound weird,

780
00:57:48,832 --> 00:57:52,101
'cause like I haven't known you
for that long,

781
00:57:52,168 --> 00:57:54,003
but, like, I feel
so comfortable with you.

782
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:55,839
Like we're bonded
or something.

783
00:57:58,775 --> 00:57:59,776
Same.

784
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:07,016
When'd you lose your virginity?

785
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:10,620
I haven't.

786
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:11,821
You haven't had sex?

787
00:58:11,888 --> 00:58:12,989
No.

788
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:14,657
Do you mean
you haven't had today?

789
00:58:14,724 --> 00:58:18,228
-What?
-You dance like
such a fuck princess!

790
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:19,662
What? No, I do not!

791
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:21,331
-Yes, you do!
-What does that even mean?

792
00:58:21,397 --> 00:58:23,233
It means exactly what it sounds
like it means!

793
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,400
You know, th...
The fuck princess!

794
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,135
-Nah. no.
-Okay, I get...

795
00:58:26,202 --> 00:58:27,370
Okay, that's on me.

796
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:29,305
-Never assume.
-You never...

797
00:58:29,372 --> 00:58:31,207
Wait, like, have you?

798
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:35,845
What?

799
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:37,714
Obviously not!

800
00:58:38,414 --> 00:58:42,752
I am so awkward

801
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:44,487
and like embarra...
Like, no!

802
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:47,357
Like, oh my God!

803
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:48,691
I will say this.

804
00:58:48,758 --> 00:58:51,227
I feel like high school sex
is very '90s.

805
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:52,428
Okay.

806
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:56,900
And waiting until college
is more now.

807
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,936
I mean, I feel like
I'm probably gonna wait
until I'm like in love.

808
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:03,940
Oh.

809
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:07,944
Oh, that's really sweet.

810
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:11,848
Or when you go on tour with
Drake one day.

811
00:59:13,283 --> 00:59:14,350
You just let him have it.

812
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:18,588
What's wheelchair Jimmy
like in bed?

813
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:27,757
What are you
thinkin' about?

814
01:00:28,424 --> 01:00:29,859
Hmm?

815
01:00:44,374 --> 01:00:47,644
Okay, I know
you're a woman
of very little words,

816
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:52,649
but I know you got
some deep shit happening

817
01:00:52,715 --> 01:00:56,152
-in this nice little head
of yours.

818
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:59,689
Beep.

819
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:02,859
God.

820
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:04,293
Anything?

821
01:01:06,129 --> 01:01:08,498
Okay.

822
01:01:08,564 --> 01:01:13,069
Let's say this.
Let's say you die tomorrow.

823
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:15,038
Okay?

824
01:01:15,138 --> 01:01:18,408
And what if you die sad,
'cause you regret not saying
what you wanted to say?

825
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:22,078
Then what?

826
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:33,056
I can't say it.

827
01:01:33,156 --> 01:01:34,590
Why?

828
01:02:08,925 --> 01:02:11,027
Is this okay?

829
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:36,712
Where have you been?

830
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:38,681
We've been freaking out!

831
01:03:38,781 --> 01:03:40,216
I was at Nick's.

832
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:43,286
Nick's been calling all morning
wondering where you are.

833
01:03:46,222 --> 01:03:47,890
Vada, your phone was dead.

834
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:49,325
We didn't know
if something terrible
had happened to you or--

835
01:03:49,392 --> 01:03:52,962
I'm sorry. I'm fine.

836
01:03:53,029 --> 01:03:55,298
The perfect child
tells a fat one.

837
01:03:55,364 --> 01:03:57,233
She better lose screen time
for that one, Dad.

838
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:59,001
Vada, come back here!

839
01:03:59,902 --> 01:04:01,170
Vada!

840
01:04:02,905 --> 01:04:04,707
I told you,
you don't have to know!

841
01:04:04,807 --> 01:04:06,509
-Vada
-Vada, don't be rude.

842
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:08,744
Vada, what were you doing
last night?

843
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:11,214
Nothing, Jesus!

844
01:04:11,314 --> 01:04:12,915
Are you...
Are you seeing someone?

845
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:15,384
LOL, seeing someone. No!

846
01:04:15,484 --> 01:04:17,587
Uh, I'll do it...
I'll do it.

847
01:04:21,824 --> 01:04:23,693
If you're gonna be
spending the night

848
01:04:23,759 --> 01:04:24,894
at someone's house, Vada--

849
01:04:24,994 --> 01:04:28,064
I'm not
having sex, Mom!

850
01:04:28,164 --> 01:04:30,333
-Okay.
-Oh, my God!

851
01:04:30,399 --> 01:04:31,868
What are you doing?

852
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,443
Last night, I slept over
at my friend Mia's house

853
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:42,678
-and I got drunk.
-You got drunk?

854
01:04:42,745 --> 01:04:45,348
Yeah, Mom, I got drunk.

855
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:48,251
I am 16 years old
and I drink alcohol,

856
01:04:48,351 --> 01:04:50,686
and here's the thing,
I don't even like drinking.

857
01:04:50,753 --> 01:04:52,955
I was just tryin' to live
in the moment,

858
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:56,259
and feel shit, and YOLO
or something, okay?

859
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:07,870
Now if you excuse me,
I am hungover as shit

860
01:05:07,937 --> 01:05:09,805
and I'm gonna go barf
in the shower.

861
01:05:12,942 --> 01:05:14,410
Who's Mia?

862
01:05:14,477 --> 01:05:15,945
Who's Mia?

863
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:31,127
I'm not even tryin' to be rude,
I'm just--

864
01:05:31,227 --> 01:05:33,129
I'm super busy
and I don't have the time.

865
01:05:33,229 --> 01:05:34,597
So.

866
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:36,933
Okay.

867
01:05:40,903 --> 01:05:42,338
I'm sorry
I never called you back,

868
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:45,074
but you didn't have
to get me in trouble, dude.

869
01:05:45,141 --> 01:05:47,076
Vada, I was just
worried about you.

870
01:05:47,143 --> 01:05:48,311
When I didn't hear back
from you,

871
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:49,745
I felt like I had to call
your mom,

872
01:05:49,812 --> 01:05:51,147
'cause the last time
I had seen you,

873
01:05:51,247 --> 01:05:53,616
you had literally done drugs
at school.

874
01:05:53,683 --> 01:05:55,151
So I was like, "Okay, cool.

875
01:05:55,251 --> 01:05:58,187
Maybe she's like having
a serotonin drop from hell

876
01:05:58,287 --> 01:06:02,458
and she's like suicidal
on a bridge somewhere and...

877
01:06:02,525 --> 01:06:04,694
Then to hear like how freaked
your family was all night,

878
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,162
I just...

879
01:06:06,262 --> 01:06:08,030
I don't know, I hoped that

880
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,199
whatever you went and did
was worth everything
you put them through.

881
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:12,034
But, you know what?

882
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:13,869
I'm guessing
uh, it's more likely you were
with Mia Reed somewhere,

883
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,871
acting like nothing happened.

884
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:18,874
Why're you being like this?

885
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:21,510
Because I've
waited for you, Vada.

886
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:26,449
For a month,
I've given you space
and love to heal.

887
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:28,384
But I've been dealing with this
my own way!

888
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:31,554
You haven't
dealt with anything,
that's the problem!

889
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:33,823
All I wanna do
is try my hardest
to stop this

890
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:35,224
from ever happening again.

891
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:39,462
Like why is that so hard
for you to understand?

892
01:06:39,528 --> 01:06:41,731
That's not fucking fair, Nick.

893
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:44,066
None of this is fair, Vada.

894
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:50,473
Yeah, yeah.
Mmm-hmm, go be with Mia.

895
01:06:50,539 --> 01:06:52,875
She's gonna save the world
with her hot ass.

896
01:06:52,975 --> 01:06:54,243
Fuck you, Nick.

897
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:55,244
Wow.

898
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:58,080
Nice.

899
01:07:02,251 --> 01:07:04,253
He's just hurtin',
I think we all are.

900
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:08,557
He was so cruel about it!

901
01:07:08,657 --> 01:07:11,427
Yeah, but you know,
he's under a lot of pressure.

902
01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:12,895
He has to be the face of this,

903
01:07:12,995 --> 01:07:17,433
just act brave, but, well,
he's scared, too.

904
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:19,268
You know,
fear makes people act crazy.

905
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:23,572
Okay, I...

906
01:07:23,672 --> 01:07:25,541
Like I'm sorry for like

907
01:07:25,608 --> 01:07:28,010
calling you and dumping
all of this on you,

908
01:07:28,077 --> 01:07:32,048
especially, because it's
been the hardest on you.

909
01:07:32,114 --> 01:07:33,682
It's hard on everyone.

910
01:07:37,353 --> 01:07:40,389
I think for me, you know,
when it hurts too much,

911
01:07:40,456 --> 01:07:44,560
I think about
how this can't be for nothing.

912
01:07:44,627 --> 01:07:46,695
Like, oh,
we won't even let this
be for not... Like, it...

913
01:07:46,762 --> 01:07:48,397
It can't be for nothing,
you know?

914
01:07:48,464 --> 01:07:50,699
Fuck. Yeah.

915
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:58,274
Tell me about your brother.

916
01:08:03,279 --> 01:08:04,980
I just wanna know
more about him.

917
01:08:09,485 --> 01:08:12,888
He was, uh, real quiet

918
01:08:12,955 --> 01:08:14,290
when you first met him.

919
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:18,394
He watched everything now,
you know.

920
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:19,829
Like, he'd be like,

921
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:21,497
"Oh, that girl is gonna go home
with that guy

922
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:23,632
and that guy is gonna go home
with that girl and..."

923
01:08:23,732 --> 01:08:26,735
Like, he was always right.

924
01:08:26,802 --> 01:08:28,804
He was funny.

925
01:08:28,904 --> 01:08:31,640
Like always making me laugh.

926
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:37,580
He, uh...

927
01:08:39,682 --> 01:08:41,317
He sounds dope.

928
01:08:47,423 --> 01:08:49,692
I feel him.

929
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:53,696
Now I know this sounds crazy
to say like...

930
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:57,133
I just...
I know he's still with me.

931
01:08:57,199 --> 01:08:59,201
He's not gonna let me
go back and be sad,

932
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:02,538
he's not gonna
let me go forward
and freak out.

933
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:05,474
He keeps me here.

934
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:07,476
He keeps me calm.

935
01:09:10,346 --> 01:09:12,648
I think he's definitely
still here.

936
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:16,619
Lot of people
don't ask me about him.

937
01:09:16,685 --> 01:09:20,789
They think I'mma like
cry or somethin'.

938
01:09:20,856 --> 01:09:24,226
Um, well, thank you.

939
01:09:29,365 --> 01:09:32,034
You can always talk
about him around me.

940
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:51,420
Wait, wait.
I'm sorry, I...

941
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,756
What's wrong?

942
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:57,026
I'm just going through a lot
right now, it's just...

943
01:09:57,092 --> 01:09:59,762
I just don't know
if I'm in the right headspace
right now.

944
01:10:02,264 --> 01:10:04,333
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, my God.

945
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,368
-I am so sorry!
-No, you're okay.

946
01:10:06,435 --> 01:10:08,170
I'm... No, of course, you are.
I'm so sorry.

947
01:10:08,237 --> 01:10:10,039
You're perfect, I like you,
it's just...

948
01:10:10,105 --> 01:10:11,373
-I'm so sorry.
-V, I swear, you didn't do
anything wrong.

949
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:12,875
I am so sorry, okay?

950
01:10:12,942 --> 01:10:14,610
No, don't be sorry, it's...
It's not like that.

951
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:15,911
I am so sorry. I am so sorry.

952
01:10:48,711 --> 01:10:50,212
I can't sleep.

953
01:11:01,624 --> 01:11:04,793
You know, I can always see
where you are on Find A Friend

954
01:11:04,893 --> 01:11:06,795
when your phone isn't dead.

955
01:11:06,895 --> 01:11:09,231
You better delete me
off of that.

956
01:11:09,298 --> 01:11:10,599
Like tomorrow,

957
01:11:10,666 --> 01:11:12,501
so I don't tell Mom
about your Finsta.

958
01:11:12,601 --> 01:11:13,802
Fine!

959
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:17,172
Why do you care where I am?

960
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:18,440
I don't.

961
01:11:21,477 --> 01:11:24,246
You're always at a house
in North Bay.

962
01:11:24,313 --> 01:11:25,414
Why?

963
01:11:25,481 --> 01:11:27,650
It's where my friend Mia lives.

964
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:28,917
Hmm.

965
01:11:37,259 --> 01:11:40,696
V, I'm scared.

966
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:42,331
Of what?

967
01:11:45,034 --> 01:11:47,670
What if...

968
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:56,478
What if a shooter comes
to my school next?

969
01:11:58,113 --> 01:11:59,882
It won't happen.

970
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:01,483
How do you know?

971
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:13,796
Sorry, I almost got you
killed in a shooting.

972
01:12:20,235 --> 01:12:21,970
What're you talking about?

973
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:24,373
If I hadn't texted you
about my stupid period,

974
01:12:24,473 --> 01:12:26,675
you wouldn't have
left the classroom.

975
01:12:26,742 --> 01:12:29,311
You would've been safe.

976
01:12:29,378 --> 01:12:31,814
-You could've died.
-That's not true.

977
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,215
Yes, it is!

978
01:12:33,315 --> 01:12:34,483
Quinton's brother died,
'cause he was walking

979
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:36,218
in the same hallway.

980
01:12:39,822 --> 01:12:42,257
It wasn't safe anywhere

981
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:44,093
Definitely wasn't your fault.

982
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:48,530
Then why have you been
so mad at me?

983
01:12:48,597 --> 01:12:51,200
I haven't been mad at you.

984
01:12:51,266 --> 01:12:52,868
Why do you keep thinking that?

985
01:12:52,935 --> 01:12:54,770
Because...

986
01:12:55,871 --> 01:12:58,507
You're never home anymore.

987
01:12:58,574 --> 01:13:00,409
You never talk to me.

988
01:13:01,844 --> 01:13:05,180
We never went to dinner
to talk about...

989
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:07,082
periods.

990
01:13:12,254 --> 01:13:14,289
I'm sorry, but I'm definitely
not mad at you.

991
01:13:20,195 --> 01:13:23,065
Can I tell you something that
I've not told anybody before?

992
01:13:28,904 --> 01:13:30,773
We were in the bathroom.

993
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:34,042
And the stall where we hid,

994
01:13:35,878 --> 01:13:37,913
there was a moment where I...

995
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:39,648
really thought
I was gonna die.

996
01:13:41,817 --> 01:13:44,052
And it was
the scariest moment of my life.

997
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:52,060
And the only person
I could think of was you.

998
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:54,763
Do you remember when I sent you
that "I love you, too"?

999
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:58,400
I thought I only had time
to text one person,

1000
01:13:58,467 --> 01:13:59,568
so I texted you.

1001
01:14:02,504 --> 01:14:04,173
I didn't know that.

1002
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:10,512
You're my favorite person
on Earth, Millie.

1003
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:17,085
Even if you get married
one day?

1004
01:14:17,152 --> 01:14:19,154
No, fuck a husband.

1005
01:14:21,023 --> 01:14:22,624
You're my number one.

1006
01:14:29,765 --> 01:14:31,834
Don't let go.

1007
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:27,589
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

1008
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:30,559
Nothing is wrong with you.

1009
01:15:30,659 --> 01:15:33,495
Oh, Dad, I...

1010
01:15:33,562 --> 01:15:35,063
I feel so...

1011
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:38,033
empty.

1012
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:41,603
Vada, you went
through something

1013
01:15:41,703 --> 01:15:44,239
no one should ever have
to go through.

1014
01:15:47,409 --> 01:15:49,444
I can't imagine
how scared you feel.

1015
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:58,453
Life's fuckin' hard.

1016
01:15:58,554 --> 01:16:01,523
I'm sorry
for saying "fucking".

1017
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:03,892
No, you're right.

1018
01:16:03,959 --> 01:16:06,094
Life's fucking hard!

1019
01:16:06,194 --> 01:16:07,296
Dad.

1020
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:09,197
What? No one's around.

1021
01:16:09,264 --> 01:16:12,100
Try it, it feels good.

1022
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:14,803
Life is fucking crazy!

1023
01:16:18,707 --> 01:16:20,108
Yeah!

1024
01:16:21,043 --> 01:16:22,144
Fuck!

1025
01:16:24,046 --> 01:16:26,715
Life's fucking confusing!

1026
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:38,327
I can't fucking feel anything!

1027
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:39,394
Good one.

1028
01:16:40,662 --> 01:16:42,631
Fuck you, Matt Corgan!

1029
01:16:42,731 --> 01:16:45,167
Yeah, fuck you!

1030
01:16:46,802 --> 01:16:50,472
I'm scared to go to school
every day!

1031
01:16:50,572 --> 01:16:53,842
I'm scared to take my children
to school!

1032
01:16:55,143 --> 01:16:56,612
I'm scared to sleep!

1033
01:16:57,913 --> 01:17:00,282
I'm scared of...

1034
01:17:00,349 --> 01:17:02,117
time!

1035
01:17:03,318 --> 01:17:05,354
We're not even
swearing anymore, Dad.

1036
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:06,788
Still feels good.

1037
01:17:09,691 --> 01:17:12,294
I'm incredibly proud

1038
01:17:12,361 --> 01:17:15,697
of how smart and amazing

1039
01:17:15,797 --> 01:17:17,032
my daughter is!

1040
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:20,535
Dad, don't be fucking cheesy!

1041
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:22,638
-Please!

1042
01:17:23,872 --> 01:17:26,041
Never again.

1043
01:17:28,443 --> 01:17:30,012
Ah!

1044
01:18:17,159 --> 01:18:18,226
Mia?

1045
01:18:36,845 --> 01:18:38,346
Mia?

1046
01:18:51,426 --> 01:18:53,061
Oh, my god!

1047
01:18:54,096 --> 01:18:55,697
Mia?

1048
01:18:57,466 --> 01:18:59,101
-Mia?

1049
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:02,204
My God.

1050
01:19:03,605 --> 01:19:05,107
I'm just sweating out.

1051
01:19:05,207 --> 01:19:06,742
I thought you were
fucking dead, dude.

1052
01:19:06,808 --> 01:19:08,410
Don't scare me like that.

1053
01:19:08,477 --> 01:19:09,745
Ah...

1054
01:19:09,811 --> 01:19:10,912
Come on.

1055
01:19:10,979 --> 01:19:12,280
Come on.

1056
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,228
Do you hate me?

1057
01:19:28,497 --> 01:19:31,733
No. Why would I hate you?

1058
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:38,173
Just scared the shit out of me.

1059
01:19:45,347 --> 01:19:46,915
And I don't regret it.

1060
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:53,121
Just scared it was gonna like
ruin our friendship
or something.

1061
01:19:57,526 --> 01:19:59,928
Yeah, I was scared
of that, too.

1062
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:08,370
Then let's not ruin anything?

1063
01:20:11,106 --> 01:20:12,641
Okay.

1064
01:20:33,862 --> 01:20:37,365
I think I'm gonna go back to
dance tomorrow.

1065
01:20:37,465 --> 01:20:40,335
Even though, I'm like literally
scared to leave my house,

1066
01:20:40,402 --> 01:20:42,204
I know I need to do it.

1067
01:20:42,304 --> 01:20:44,239
That's amazing.
You totally should.

1068
01:20:49,211 --> 01:20:50,378
Well, what are you gonna do?

1069
01:20:50,478 --> 01:20:52,547
I'm gonna go with you.

1070
01:20:52,647 --> 01:20:54,482
No, you're not.
We never discussed this.

1071
01:20:54,549 --> 01:20:57,352
Stop trying to get rid of me!

1072
01:20:59,588 --> 01:21:01,523
I am Postmate-ing us
frozen yogurt.

1073
01:21:05,727 --> 01:21:07,229
I think I actually want some.

1074
01:21:07,329 --> 01:21:09,164
Okay, then push.

1075
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,269
I like the doodles.

1076
01:21:14,369 --> 01:21:17,172
Who's that guy?
Is that Harry Potter?

1077
01:21:17,239 --> 01:21:18,607
That's Paul Dano.

1078
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:20,075
He's my celebrity crush.

1079
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:26,448
How was this?

1080
01:21:26,548 --> 01:21:29,384
Processing through
all these emotions?

1081
01:21:29,451 --> 01:21:30,452
Good.

1082
01:21:32,287 --> 01:21:36,024
I had a lot of ups and downs,

1083
01:21:36,091 --> 01:21:39,728
but I feel like
I felt everything.

1084
01:21:39,794 --> 01:21:41,630
So that's...

1085
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:43,431
It's good, I guess.

1086
01:21:43,531 --> 01:21:47,135
I noticed that you used
the word "scared" a few times.

1087
01:21:47,235 --> 01:21:48,737
When did you feel
the most scared?

1088
01:21:53,708 --> 01:21:55,277
Being at school.

1089
01:21:57,746 --> 01:22:00,315
I don't feel comfortable
being back there.

1090
01:22:00,415 --> 01:22:04,219
Can you tell me more
about that?

1091
01:22:04,286 --> 01:22:05,654
You know,
all these kids from my school,

1092
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:09,324
specifically one of
my closest friends, Nick,

1093
01:22:09,424 --> 01:22:12,394
who I love so much, um...

1094
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:16,264
they've been able to take

1095
01:22:16,331 --> 01:22:18,400
what happened, and...

1096
01:22:20,402 --> 01:22:25,507
are literally using it
to change the world.

1097
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:28,410
Like, they're doing so much
amazing stuff and...

1098
01:22:32,914 --> 01:22:36,251
For some reason, I feel like
I'm unable to do that.

1099
01:22:40,188 --> 01:22:44,092
I feel like
it has kind of ended
our friendship.

1100
01:22:48,363 --> 01:22:49,864
Sucks.

1101
01:22:51,533 --> 01:22:53,468
'Cause I really,
really miss him.

1102
01:22:55,337 --> 01:22:57,005
What are you feeling right now?

1103
01:23:00,175 --> 01:23:02,010
I don't know.

1104
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:03,445
Yes, you do.

1105
01:23:13,321 --> 01:23:14,889
I feel...

1106
01:23:19,027 --> 01:23:20,662
mad.

1107
01:23:23,298 --> 01:23:24,466
Mad about what?

1108
01:23:24,532 --> 01:23:28,136
I feel mad,
because I had no idea

1109
01:23:28,203 --> 01:23:29,337
one guy with a gun

1110
01:23:29,404 --> 01:23:31,906
could fuck up my life so hard

1111
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:34,342
in six minutes.

1112
01:23:34,409 --> 01:23:37,078
Fuck up so many lives!

1113
01:23:37,178 --> 01:23:40,248
Then I think I should be
grateful to be alive.

1114
01:23:42,050 --> 01:23:44,252
I feel like, I don't know,
maybe there's some

1115
01:23:44,352 --> 01:23:46,321
weird fucked up reason why

1116
01:23:46,388 --> 01:23:50,025
I made it
and other people didn't.

1117
01:23:50,091 --> 01:23:53,528
Um, but then when you sit back

1118
01:23:53,595 --> 01:23:58,233
and you think about it,
you realize, "No!

1119
01:23:58,333 --> 01:23:59,701
There isn't.

1120
01:24:02,337 --> 01:24:03,605
There's no fucking reason."

1121
01:24:05,373 --> 01:24:07,375
None of us should've died.

1122
01:24:26,728 --> 01:24:29,697
I'm having a really hard time
moving on.

1123
01:24:51,319 --> 01:24:53,721
Oh, hi.

1124
01:24:53,788 --> 01:24:55,323
I'm sorry.

1125
01:24:57,392 --> 01:24:59,461
I love you.

1126
01:24:59,561 --> 01:25:02,730
Sweetheart, I love you, too.

1127
01:25:02,797 --> 01:25:06,000
I'm gonna try to be more honest
with you about my life.

1128
01:25:07,335 --> 01:25:08,403
You know what?

1129
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:12,774
I would really,
really like that.

1130
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:19,013
I've been really struggling.

1131
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:20,515
Mmm-hmm.

1132
01:25:20,615 --> 01:25:22,684
And I don't know why it's been
so hard to tell you like,

1133
01:25:22,784 --> 01:25:24,486
'cause I just didn't
want you to worry.

1134
01:25:24,586 --> 01:25:28,089
And you're right, I was acting
funny that time I was drunk,

1135
01:25:28,156 --> 01:25:31,259
because I did have sex
with someone.

1136
01:25:31,326 --> 01:25:33,928
And I was a little bit stoned,
but not as stoned

1137
01:25:33,995 --> 01:25:36,464
as I was when I was on E.

1138
01:25:36,531 --> 01:25:38,032
Jesus, that was rough.

1139
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:40,201
And the person I was having sex
with wasn't the person

1140
01:25:40,301 --> 01:25:42,337
that I thought
I was maybe gonna
be having sex with,

1141
01:25:42,437 --> 01:25:44,339
but I'm...
I'm telling you all of this,

1142
01:25:44,439 --> 01:25:47,041
because I want you to know
that I'm...

1143
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:50,278
I'm never gonna do any of that
stuff ever again.

1144
01:25:50,345 --> 01:25:52,313
You know, the bad...
The bad stuff.

1145
01:25:53,982 --> 01:25:55,717
Mmm-hmm.

1146
01:25:57,152 --> 01:25:58,486
Mmm-hmm.

1147
01:26:00,688 --> 01:26:03,958
Okay. Well,
thank you for uh...

1148
01:26:05,326 --> 01:26:06,528
For trusting me.

1149
01:26:07,328 --> 01:26:08,696
With this information.

1150
01:26:15,136 --> 01:26:16,304
Was that too much?

1151
01:26:16,371 --> 01:26:18,406
No! I am...

1152
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:21,676
I'm processing.

1153
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:25,547
Don't worry,
it was with a girl.

1154
01:26:25,647 --> 01:26:26,681
Hmm?

1155
01:26:26,748 --> 01:26:28,149
The sex stuff.

1156
01:26:28,216 --> 01:26:30,552
It was with a girl,

1157
01:26:30,652 --> 01:26:32,353
so it's not
like I'm gonna get pregnant.

1158
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:34,589
That's a bonus, right?

1159
01:26:34,689 --> 01:26:36,591
Yeah.

1160
01:26:36,691 --> 01:26:38,660
Bonus.

1161
01:26:48,369 --> 01:26:50,572
Okay.

1162
01:26:50,672 --> 01:26:52,941
I'm... I'm ready
to talk about it more now.
