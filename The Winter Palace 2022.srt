3
00:00:18,453 --> 00:00:20,672
- They can't start construction
at 7 A.M.

4
00:00:20,716 --> 00:00:21,891
You have a book to write.

5
00:00:21,934 --> 00:00:23,327
- I know, but what can I do?

6
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:25,373
Neighbors on both sides
are redoing their kitchens!

7
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:27,418
It's impossible to concentrate.

8
00:00:27,462 --> 00:00:29,203
On the upside,
I did write a poem

9
00:00:29,246 --> 00:00:31,248
called Ode to a Jackhammer.

10
00:00:34,512 --> 00:00:37,124
Oh hey, they're, uh...
They're taking down my display.

11
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:39,213
- Oh no. At least your book
was in the window

12
00:00:39,256 --> 00:00:41,432
for what, almost ten months?

13
00:00:41,476 --> 00:00:43,478
- Ten months, two weeks,
and four days!

14
00:00:43,521 --> 00:00:45,132
But... who's counting?

15
00:00:45,175 --> 00:00:46,655
- Well, I love that book

16
00:00:46,698 --> 00:00:48,309
and I can't wait
for the next one.

17
00:00:50,267 --> 00:00:52,400
I better head to work.
I don't want to keep
my boss waiting.

18
00:00:52,443 --> 00:00:53,705
- Yeah, my publisher
wants me to call.

19
00:00:53,749 --> 00:00:55,098
But can we meet
for coffee later?

20
00:00:55,142 --> 00:00:56,491
I'll be there trying to write.

21
00:00:56,534 --> 00:00:58,275
I want to hear all about
your new job!

22
00:00:58,319 --> 00:00:59,624
- You bet.

23
00:01:03,019 --> 00:01:05,326
- They're not gonna just
toss me away.

24
00:01:08,764 --> 00:01:10,461
Hey, Allen. How are you?

25
00:01:10,505 --> 00:01:13,073
- Better once I hear
good new about book two.

26
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:15,162
How's it going?

27
00:01:15,945 --> 00:01:18,208
- That is such
an interesting question.

28
00:01:18,252 --> 00:01:19,557
- Here we go...

29
00:01:19,601 --> 00:01:21,820
- Because I've been outlining,

30
00:01:21,864 --> 00:01:23,605
and working out
some story points.

31
00:01:23,648 --> 00:01:26,869
- Emily, your first book
did great business.

32
00:01:26,912 --> 00:01:29,045
But you can't rest
on your laurels.

33
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,917
- Believe me, I'm not resting
on anything.

34
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,573
I-It's just, uh...

35
00:01:35,617 --> 00:01:37,880
a little trickier
with this new book.

36
00:01:37,923 --> 00:01:39,447
- You're a great writer, Emily,

37
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,101
when you actually write.

38
00:01:41,144 --> 00:01:43,494
But word from upstairs
is that if we don't see

39
00:01:43,538 --> 00:01:45,192
the first three chapters
at least

40
00:01:45,235 --> 00:01:46,410
by the end of the month...

41
00:01:46,454 --> 00:01:47,933
- Then they'll cancel your book.

42
00:01:47,977 --> 00:01:50,066
- And I'll be in breach
of contract.

43
00:01:50,632 --> 00:01:53,330
I mean, yes, I was supposed
to finish a few months ago,

44
00:01:53,374 --> 00:01:55,158
so they've already spent
the ad budget promoting

45
00:01:55,202 --> 00:01:57,117
a book that doesn't exist,
and now

46
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,075
they want to cut their losses.

47
00:01:59,641 --> 00:02:01,469
- Have you finished
any chapters?

48
00:02:01,512 --> 00:02:03,123
- You know, it's...

49
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,907
It is tricky trying to write
a romance

50
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,430
fresh from a breakup, so...

51
00:02:06,474 --> 00:02:09,129
- Fresh? It's been
almost a year.

52
00:02:11,174 --> 00:02:14,699
- I mean, it's...
It's just hard to write,

53
00:02:14,743 --> 00:02:16,353
and I don't know why.

54
00:02:17,528 --> 00:02:19,443
It doesn't help that half
the places in Boulder

55
00:02:19,487 --> 00:02:20,792
remind me of Michael.

56
00:02:22,185 --> 00:02:25,275
Ugh, enough of my complaining.
Okay...

57
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,755
How's your new job?

58
00:02:26,798 --> 00:02:28,409
- Only been there a week,

59
00:02:28,452 --> 00:02:30,193
but I never knew
that property management

60
00:02:30,237 --> 00:02:31,325
could be so complicated.

61
00:02:31,368 --> 00:02:34,502
- You are gonna do great,
I know it.

62
00:02:34,545 --> 00:02:35,851
- Wait...

63
00:02:35,894 --> 00:02:38,245
I have an idea
that could help the both of us!

64
00:02:38,288 --> 00:02:41,465
- Uh, I might be beyond help,
but shoot.

65
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:43,467
- My boss got a call
this morning.

66
00:02:43,511 --> 00:02:45,861
One of the caretakers
at the property they manage

67
00:02:45,904 --> 00:02:47,863
had to leave 'cause his dad
slipped and fell.

68
00:02:47,906 --> 00:02:49,778
- Is he okay?
- He'll be fine.

69
00:02:49,821 --> 00:02:53,477
But they need a winter caretaker
to fill in ASAP.

70
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:55,087
- Uh, a caretaker,
what do you mean?

71
00:02:55,131 --> 00:02:56,785
- It's this empty chalet
up in the mountains.

72
00:02:56,828 --> 00:02:58,830
It belongs to some wealthy
family in Europe

73
00:02:58,874 --> 00:03:00,528
but they haven't been there
in years.

74
00:03:00,571 --> 00:03:02,138
- What does this have
to do with me?

75
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,836
- You need somewhere quiet
to write, some solitude

76
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,186
so you can focus.

77
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:08,536
And didn't you say
it's hard to think romance

78
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:10,581
in Boulder right now?
- Well, yes.

79
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,757
- And I'd look pretty good
first week on the job

80
00:03:12,801 --> 00:03:14,368
if I helped out in a pinch!

81
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:16,196
My boss is desperate.

82
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,502
- Look, a winter chalet
sounds magical,

83
00:03:18,546 --> 00:03:20,765
but I've never been
a caretaker before.

84
00:03:20,809 --> 00:03:22,114
What would I need to do?

85
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:24,682
- Just knock some icicles
off the roof,

86
00:03:24,726 --> 00:03:26,510
and run the water
so the pipes don't freeze.

87
00:03:26,554 --> 00:03:27,729
That's it.

88
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:29,513
With the owners never there,

89
00:03:29,557 --> 00:03:32,473
the place runs itself.

90
00:03:32,516 --> 00:03:34,388
- Wow.

91
00:03:34,431 --> 00:03:35,606
It's gorgeous.

92
00:03:36,955 --> 00:03:38,914
A change of scenery
couldn't hurt.

93
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,091
Okay, let's say
I was interested. What's next?

94
00:03:42,134 --> 00:03:44,093
- Meet my boss
and look over the contract.

95
00:03:44,136 --> 00:03:45,268
That's it.

96
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:47,488
- Hmm.

97
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:50,230
A winter writing retreat.

98
00:03:50,273 --> 00:03:53,145
Okay! Where do I sign?

99
00:04:17,213 --> 00:04:19,650
"Emily, the key opens the door,

100
00:04:19,694 --> 00:04:22,262
the pen is so you do
some great writing,

101
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:23,872
good luck. Becca."

102
00:04:43,587 --> 00:04:45,328
I could get used to this.

103
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:48,331
- So, what do you think
of the place?

104
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,724
- It's gorgeous!

105
00:04:49,767 --> 00:04:51,856
It's so inviting and warm,

106
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,902
and some interesting decor.

107
00:04:53,945 --> 00:04:56,818
Becca, this place is perfect.

108
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:59,342
- Well, my boss couldn't be
happier with me,

109
00:04:59,386 --> 00:05:02,432
so if you get some writing done,
it's a classic win-win.

110
00:05:02,476 --> 00:05:03,868
Is it romantic?

111
00:05:03,912 --> 00:05:05,566
You are writing a romance,
after all.

112
00:05:05,609 --> 00:05:08,438
- Yep! All by my lonesome.

113
00:05:26,978 --> 00:05:28,676
Yes!

114
00:05:28,719 --> 00:05:29,981
No...

115
00:06:13,198 --> 00:06:15,549
A fresh start in the morning
couldn't hurt.

116
00:06:17,725 --> 00:06:20,031
First day, and I'm already
talking to myself.

117
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,434
Who goes there?!

118
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:16,958
- Uh, what? Hello?

119
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:18,263
Hi.

120
00:07:18,307 --> 00:07:20,222
- Uh, if it's a package,

121
00:07:20,265 --> 00:07:21,919
just leave it at the door.
Thank you.

122
00:07:21,963 --> 00:07:24,879
- No, I'm not a delivery man.

123
00:07:24,922 --> 00:07:26,924
Perhaps you'd be so kind
as to open the door.

124
00:07:26,968 --> 00:07:29,449
- Uh, sorry,
that's not gonna happen.

125
00:07:29,492 --> 00:07:30,928
- Why not, may I ask?

126
00:07:31,973 --> 00:07:34,105
- Clayton, it's okay!
Go back to sleep!

127
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:35,803
My four brothers are sleeping

128
00:07:35,846 --> 00:07:38,414
and army rangers on leave
get so tired.

129
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,285
- Look, I can prove
that I've been here before.

130
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:42,766
There should be a desk by
the window with a quill pen,

131
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,465
and a coat of arms
above the fire place.

132
00:07:46,204 --> 00:07:48,337
- Yes, but I would need to
contact the property company--

133
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,078
- I even have a key,

134
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:52,210
I just can't seem
to work it in the lock.

135
00:07:52,254 --> 00:07:53,603
- Where did you get that key?

136
00:07:53,647 --> 00:07:55,736
- My family owns this chalet,

137
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:57,302
I'm... I'm Henry.

138
00:07:57,346 --> 00:07:59,391
- The family who owns
the chalet lives somewhere...

139
00:07:59,435 --> 00:08:00,784
- In Europe! Yes.

140
00:08:00,828 --> 00:08:03,439
Concordia, to be exact.

141
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:08,400
- Uh...

142
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,968
Uh, sorry about that.

143
00:08:11,012 --> 00:08:12,535
- Oh no, it's quite alright.

144
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:14,885
It's just a bit freezing
out there.

145
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,542
- So, a-are you staying?
- Who are you?

146
00:08:19,586 --> 00:08:20,891
- Emily.
- What are you doing here?

147
00:08:20,935 --> 00:08:22,153
- My job.
- What's your job?

148
00:08:22,197 --> 00:08:23,372
- Making sure pipes don't burst.

149
00:08:23,415 --> 00:08:25,592
- Ah...
- And keeping burglars away.

150
00:08:25,635 --> 00:08:27,245
- Do I look like a burglar?
- Maybe.

151
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:28,508
A well-dressed one.

152
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:30,031
Look, I'm gonna make a call.

153
00:08:30,074 --> 00:08:32,990
- Really, I am very tired
and there is so much to do.

154
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:34,862
So perhaps you can
start us some tea?

155
00:08:36,037 --> 00:08:36,994
- Uh...

156
00:08:37,865 --> 00:08:39,867
Oh, there's more people.

157
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:43,044
- Really, Henry, there's no
excuse for driving like that!

158
00:08:43,087 --> 00:08:44,785
- Sorry, Tilson,
those mountain curves

159
00:08:44,828 --> 00:08:46,264
were way too tempting,
and anyway,

160
00:08:46,308 --> 00:08:48,136
you should've kept up.
- Well, if you insist

161
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:50,007
on driving yourself,
at least let Fritz

162
00:08:50,051 --> 00:08:51,095
drive with you.

163
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:53,097
What's this?
- I don't know.

164
00:08:53,141 --> 00:08:54,882
Some sort of Emily person.

165
00:08:54,925 --> 00:08:56,318
- What's going on here?

166
00:08:56,361 --> 00:08:57,667
- Apparently, I'm a burglar.

167
00:08:57,711 --> 00:09:00,583
- Actually, I said "maybe,"
if you recall.

168
00:09:00,627 --> 00:09:03,368
- Well, your diligence
is commendable but misplaced.

169
00:09:03,412 --> 00:09:05,196
I've been in touch
with your employer,

170
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,763
the property management company.

171
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:09,070
You are Ms. Miller, I presume.
- Yes.

172
00:09:09,113 --> 00:09:10,332
- We flew in from Concordia
this morning.

173
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,594
I would've telephoned,

174
00:09:11,638 --> 00:09:13,770
but apparently,
your phone is turned off?

175
00:09:13,814 --> 00:09:15,598
- I did forget to charge it
last night.

176
00:09:15,642 --> 00:09:17,165
- Tilson, send a call
to my father.

177
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,428
Fritz, old chap, have a look
at that alleged

178
00:09:19,471 --> 00:09:20,821
sports utility vehicle.

179
00:09:20,864 --> 00:09:22,431
The suspension feels
a bit dodgy.

180
00:09:22,474 --> 00:09:23,650
- Sir.

181
00:09:23,693 --> 00:09:25,695
- Oh, I'm sorry.
We wouldn't want to wake

182
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:28,002
Clayton and the rest
of the army rangers, would we?

183
00:09:28,045 --> 00:09:29,917
- I made that up.
- Did you?

184
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,223
- Just as a precaution.
- You're so clever.

185
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:33,573
- Your Highness,
we're behind schedule.

186
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:34,878
- Of course. Emily...

187
00:09:34,922 --> 00:09:37,664
That tea when you get
a second, please.

188
00:09:38,403 --> 00:09:40,405
- Um...

189
00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:41,668
Wait, "Your Highness"?

190
00:09:41,711 --> 00:09:43,365
- Yes, that is the proper
form of address

191
00:09:43,408 --> 00:09:45,280
for the crowned prince
of Concordia.

192
00:09:45,323 --> 00:09:47,935
- Yeah, right!

193
00:09:47,978 --> 00:09:49,110
A prince!

194
00:09:49,153 --> 00:09:51,808
- You may do a web search
if you must.

195
00:09:51,852 --> 00:09:53,549
- If I had a signal, I would.

196
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,899
- We brought our own hotspot.

197
00:09:55,943 --> 00:09:58,859
Password is OffWithTheirHeads!
All one word.

198
00:09:58,902 --> 00:10:00,991
Prince Henry does enjoy
the odd joke.

199
00:10:01,731 --> 00:10:03,385
- Could've fooled me.

200
00:10:04,865 --> 00:10:06,693
A prince?

201
00:10:18,356 --> 00:10:19,793
- Sorry...

202
00:10:24,885 --> 00:10:27,235
- Uh...

203
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:29,193
Your Highness, I'm...

204
00:10:29,237 --> 00:10:31,326
Do I curtsey, or bow, or--
- Oh, no.

205
00:10:31,369 --> 00:10:32,893
A simple "good morning" will do.

206
00:10:32,936 --> 00:10:34,764
- Good morning.

207
00:10:36,157 --> 00:10:37,637
You know, I...

208
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,421
I should probably change.

209
00:10:39,464 --> 00:10:41,379
- You might need your socks.

210
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:45,470
- Oh my goodness, I'm so sorry!

211
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:48,386
I found a hole in my boots
last night, and I was just...

212
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,518
I was just drying them off.

213
00:10:49,561 --> 00:10:51,999
- On the Concordian
coat of arms?

214
00:10:52,042 --> 00:10:53,827
- Oh, is that what that is?

215
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:54,958
It's nice.

216
00:10:55,002 --> 00:10:57,265
- What is your role around here?

217
00:10:57,918 --> 00:10:59,397
- I'm the caretaker.

218
00:10:59,441 --> 00:11:01,138
- The caretaker, really?

219
00:11:01,182 --> 00:11:02,357
- Is that so hard to believe?

220
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,968
- I just don't see
much care being taken.

221
00:11:05,012 --> 00:11:07,318
- Ha, right.

222
00:11:11,758 --> 00:11:13,673
- Interesting slippers.

223
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:20,070
- I'm just gonna go
change my clothes and take
these slippers off.

224
00:11:22,377 --> 00:11:26,120
- So, flight was smooth
as can be.

225
00:11:27,034 --> 00:11:29,253
No, Father, I'll be home
in a week,

226
00:11:29,297 --> 00:11:32,039
after my task is complete,
I told you.

227
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:37,218
Look, can't Edwina handle
the cabinet meeting

228
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:38,436
just this once? I mean,

229
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,612
that's what royal siblings
are for.

230
00:11:41,962 --> 00:11:44,094
Right. Tilson,
my schedule, please.

231
00:11:44,138 --> 00:11:46,444
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Um...

232
00:11:46,488 --> 00:11:49,447
Yes, perhaps I can
try to fit it in!

233
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:55,279
- So he's really a prince, huh?

234
00:11:55,323 --> 00:11:57,064
- For a short time, anyway.

235
00:11:57,107 --> 00:11:58,630
Next week, he'll be king.

236
00:11:59,283 --> 00:12:02,025
Now, introductions. Fritz...

237
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:05,246
- I'm Fritz, his Highness'
body guard and personal valet.

238
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:07,291
- Ah, nice to meet you, Fritz.

239
00:12:07,335 --> 00:12:10,294
- And I'm Ms. Tilson,
the prince's chief of staff.

240
00:12:10,338 --> 00:12:13,297
It's my job to make sure
that the prince's royal duties

241
00:12:13,341 --> 00:12:15,952
are met with utmost precision.

242
00:12:15,996 --> 00:12:18,476
- Gotcha. That's great. Uh...

243
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,696
Look, you guys seem
really busy, um...

244
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,438
I just came down to let you know
I'm gonna gather my stuff,

245
00:12:23,481 --> 00:12:26,963
pack it up, and leave you
to your royal business.

246
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,749
- And why would you do that?

247
00:12:30,445 --> 00:12:32,577
- Well, I mean,
you're all here now.

248
00:12:32,621 --> 00:12:34,231
I assume you don't want
me in your way.

249
00:12:34,275 --> 00:12:37,234
- Want and need
are two separate things.

250
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,715
You are the caretaker,

251
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,195
are you not?

252
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,241
- Uh, yeah, sure.
I mean, for like 24 hours now.

253
00:12:44,285 --> 00:12:46,940
- Well, due to short notice,
only Fritz and myself

254
00:12:46,983 --> 00:12:48,811
are here to see
to the prince's needs.

255
00:12:48,855 --> 00:12:53,250
Your services are still required
for the week that we are here.

256
00:12:53,294 --> 00:12:55,818
- Um, my job was to knock
icicles loose

257
00:12:55,862 --> 00:12:57,385
and keeps the pipes
from freezing out.

258
00:12:57,428 --> 00:13:00,127
- And you shall, while doing
other tasks as well.

259
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,433
It usually takes at least
a dozen staff

260
00:13:02,477 --> 00:13:04,784
to meet the basic needs
of the prince.

261
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:06,437
- Look...

262
00:13:06,481 --> 00:13:08,004
I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

263
00:13:08,048 --> 00:13:10,746
- No, I think it is you
who fails to understand.

264
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,923
May I remind you of the contract
that you signed?

265
00:13:13,967 --> 00:13:15,620
If you have any issues,

266
00:13:15,664 --> 00:13:18,449
may I suggest you take it up
with the management company.

267
00:13:18,493 --> 00:13:20,974
- Um... No, no, no.
See, I-I-I...

268
00:13:21,017 --> 00:13:22,976
I came here for peace and quiet.

269
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:24,716
Okay, I'm a writer, and--

270
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,327
- And that will be all.

271
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,372
Staff, back to work.

272
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,857
- And I was standing there
in my pink bathrobe

273
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:37,773
and bunny slippers!
It was humiliating!

274
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,340
- They swooped in unexpectedly.

275
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:42,647
I had no idea. My boss said
they haven't visited in years.

276
00:13:42,691 --> 00:13:44,171
- Becca, it's not your fault.

277
00:13:44,214 --> 00:13:47,957
But... they can't be right
about that contract I signed.

278
00:13:48,001 --> 00:13:50,873
- I'm so sorry, but I just
read the fine print.

279
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:54,703
"The caretaker shall assist
with all reasonable requests

280
00:13:54,746 --> 00:13:57,227
made by the property owner
or their representative."

281
00:13:57,271 --> 00:14:00,100
- Huh. As a writer, you'd think
I'd pay more attention

282
00:14:00,143 --> 00:14:01,623
to the words.

283
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,494
Guess I should've read
the whole contract.

284
00:14:03,538 --> 00:14:05,018
- Em, this is all my fault.

285
00:14:05,061 --> 00:14:08,021
Just come home, I'll deal
with this as best I can.

286
00:14:08,064 --> 00:14:09,805
- Thank you.
- You're up there to write,

287
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,938
not to get wrapped up
in my drama.

288
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:13,461
- Drama?

289
00:14:13,504 --> 00:14:14,810
Oh, wait a minute.

290
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,638
Becca, if I quit
and break my contract,

291
00:14:16,681 --> 00:14:18,379
then you're in bad
with your new boss.

292
00:14:18,422 --> 00:14:20,163
- It'll be fine,
I'll figure something out.

293
00:14:20,207 --> 00:14:22,470
- No, no, no, no. Becca, I...

294
00:14:22,513 --> 00:14:23,906
You know what? I got this.

295
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,866
I will write in the evenings
and in other spare time.

296
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:28,780
- But the deadline
for your book.

297
00:14:28,824 --> 00:14:30,608
Emily, are you sure about this?

298
00:14:30,652 --> 00:14:31,522
- Positive!

299
00:14:31,566 --> 00:14:32,872
Besides, as a writer,

300
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:35,178
I need to open myself up
to new experiences

301
00:14:35,222 --> 00:14:37,528
and interesting characters.

302
00:14:37,572 --> 00:14:40,009
You never know. Maybe this
will give me some new material

303
00:14:40,053 --> 00:14:41,054
for my book.

304
00:14:41,097 --> 00:14:43,012
- Okay, if you're sure.

305
00:14:48,626 --> 00:14:50,890
In fact, I think
I already have some.

306
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,546
- Ms. Miller, please.

307
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,940
- Yes, Ms. Tilson,
I'm clearing out my things,

308
00:14:57,984 --> 00:14:59,463
like you asked.

309
00:14:59,507 --> 00:15:02,379
- And all the other rooms
you tried writing in, please.

310
00:15:03,511 --> 00:15:05,295
- Well, what is all this for?

311
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,341
- The prince has wall-to-wall
interviews

312
00:15:07,384 --> 00:15:09,299
and video calls scheduled.

313
00:15:10,213 --> 00:15:12,868
Oh. What's this?

314
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,958
- Oh, my idea book.
Can't forget that.

315
00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:18,308
- Oh, Tilson!

316
00:15:18,352 --> 00:15:21,094
I need your thoughts
on the last line of my speech.

317
00:15:21,137 --> 00:15:22,617
Now, the new ending
sounds like this.

318
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,011
So, "Ladies and gentlemen
and gathered dignitaries,

319
00:15:25,054 --> 00:15:26,882
this treaty will benefit
both of our nations,

320
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,711
with 20 percent more
high-tech trade,

321
00:15:29,754 --> 00:15:31,800
and 18 percent...

322
00:15:31,843 --> 00:15:33,933
expanded agricultural exports."

323
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,805
How's that sound?

324
00:15:36,848 --> 00:15:38,546
- A little stuffy, actually.

325
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:40,330
- I beg your pardon?

326
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:42,854
- Oh. Sorry, Your Highness.

327
00:15:43,855 --> 00:15:45,988
I just meant it sounded
a little formal.

328
00:15:46,032 --> 00:15:47,685
- Yes, of course
it sounds formal.

329
00:15:47,729 --> 00:15:49,992
This address was crafted
by several members

330
00:15:50,036 --> 00:15:51,646
of the Concordian
foreign service

331
00:15:51,689 --> 00:15:54,344
to thaw trade with one of our
formerly quarrelsome neighbors,

332
00:15:54,388 --> 00:15:56,390
the nation of Ancadia.

333
00:15:56,433 --> 00:15:58,566
Did you have
a better suggestion, or...?

334
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,786
- Then it's a happy
occasion, right?

335
00:16:02,744 --> 00:16:03,875
- Sure.

336
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:06,008
- Yeah, how about
something like, um...

337
00:16:06,052 --> 00:16:09,055
"So, formal rivals
and now future friends,

338
00:16:09,098 --> 00:16:12,014
this happy day is long overdue.

339
00:16:12,058 --> 00:16:15,191
A chance to turn
swords into silicon chips,

340
00:16:15,235 --> 00:16:17,628
and arguments into apples."
Something like that.

341
00:16:17,672 --> 00:16:19,630
And then, "To benefit
both our great nations

342
00:16:19,674 --> 00:16:21,067
moving forward."

343
00:16:21,763 --> 00:16:24,244
- Hmm. I like the ring of that.

344
00:16:24,287 --> 00:16:25,636
- Yeah?

345
00:16:27,856 --> 00:16:29,945
- That might work.

346
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,120
- You're welcome.

347
00:16:31,947 --> 00:16:33,862
- Oh, sorry.
Where are my manners?

348
00:16:33,905 --> 00:16:35,864
Thank you.

349
00:16:36,691 --> 00:16:38,954
- Oh, that's my pen.

350
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,087
- Ms. Miller...

351
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,653
A word?

352
00:16:42,697 --> 00:16:44,003
- Yes.

353
00:16:47,702 --> 00:16:49,530
Wow! All this stuff!

354
00:16:49,573 --> 00:16:51,227
Y-You guys planning an invasion?

355
00:16:51,271 --> 00:16:52,837
- The prince insists

356
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:54,404
on a regimented daily schedule,

357
00:16:54,448 --> 00:16:57,190
so as not to waste
even a minute of his time.

358
00:16:57,233 --> 00:17:00,236
- Man. If I were that organized,
I'd crank out a book a week.

359
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,455
- Yes, about that...

360
00:17:01,498 --> 00:17:03,674
While you may be a writer,

361
00:17:03,718 --> 00:17:05,937
you're also a member
of the royal household

362
00:17:05,981 --> 00:17:06,764
this week.

363
00:17:06,808 --> 00:17:07,939
- Of course, Ms. Tilson,

364
00:17:07,983 --> 00:17:09,506
but I do plan on writing
in my spare time.

365
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:12,031
- How you spend your free time
is none of my concern.

366
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:13,815
But as a member of the staff,

367
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:16,165
I need to make you aware
of what is expected.

368
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:17,732
- Right.
- Firstly...

369
00:17:17,775 --> 00:17:22,215
You do not offer your opinion
willy-nilly to the prince!

370
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:24,956
He is very busy.
- But don't you think it helped?

371
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,742
- That's irrelevant.
You speak when spoken to.

372
00:17:27,785 --> 00:17:29,265
And that is all.

373
00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:30,484
- Got it, okay.

374
00:17:30,527 --> 00:17:32,834
What else?
- As to your duties,

375
00:17:32,877 --> 00:17:34,923
you will start your day
by procuring

376
00:17:34,966 --> 00:17:36,925
the prince's morning newspaper.

377
00:17:36,968 --> 00:17:38,970
- Uh, can't he just
read the news online?

378
00:17:39,014 --> 00:17:42,148
- The prince enjoys an actual
newspaper with his breakfast,

379
00:17:42,191 --> 00:17:44,237
which commences at 7:05
every morning.

380
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,108
- Okay. Newspaper, check.

381
00:17:46,152 --> 00:17:47,979
- The prince reads
the London Concord

382
00:17:48,023 --> 00:17:49,764
to stay up on world affairs.

383
00:17:49,807 --> 00:17:51,374
- Uh...

384
00:17:51,418 --> 00:17:53,333
The closest this town
has to a news stand

385
00:17:53,376 --> 00:17:55,552
is some magazines
at the gas station mini mart.

386
00:17:55,596 --> 00:17:57,859
- You'll figure it out.
Now, moving on,

387
00:17:57,902 --> 00:17:59,861
the prince prefers
his eggs soft-boiled.

388
00:17:59,904 --> 00:18:02,429
- Oh, Ms. Tilson.
I have to stop you right there.

389
00:18:02,472 --> 00:18:04,039
I am not much of a cook.

390
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,998
- The prince's personal chef
learned his wife was in labor

391
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:10,480
as we left for the airport,
so as the chef is not available,

392
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:13,266
you will step in.
Now, there should always be

393
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:15,572
a crackling fire going
and tea at the ready.

394
00:18:15,616 --> 00:18:19,620
Tea should be served between
76 and 85 degrees Celsius

395
00:18:19,663 --> 00:18:22,362
unless the prince requests
oolong, which should be served

396
00:18:22,405 --> 00:18:24,842
between 82 and 87 degrees.

397
00:18:24,886 --> 00:18:26,975
Any questions?
- Just one.

398
00:18:27,018 --> 00:18:29,151
Can you take that again
from the top?

399
00:18:38,378 --> 00:18:39,857
- Fritz, we're frozen again.

400
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:41,729
- Uh, we're back, sir.
- Right.

401
00:18:41,772 --> 00:18:44,253
Okay, so, yes...
As I was saying,

402
00:18:44,297 --> 00:18:46,951
addressing the manufacturer's
association by web cam

403
00:18:46,995 --> 00:18:49,302
is more than sufficient,
I assure you.

404
00:18:49,345 --> 00:18:51,521
- It's just not how
things are done, Henry.

405
00:18:51,565 --> 00:18:54,481
- Shirking your royal duties,
big brother?

406
00:18:54,524 --> 00:18:56,396
- Quite the opposite.
I am on the phone

407
00:18:56,439 --> 00:18:58,615
with both of you right now,
and if I were back home,

408
00:18:58,659 --> 00:19:00,400
look, I wouldn't be able
to attend

409
00:19:00,443 --> 00:19:01,488
to important matters here.

410
00:19:01,531 --> 00:19:03,229
- Don't worry, Henry.

411
00:19:03,272 --> 00:19:04,926
I'll cover for you
while you're gone.

412
00:19:04,969 --> 00:19:07,189
Anyway, I played
the queen before,

413
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:09,713
when I was six and wore
Mother's tiara.

414
00:19:09,757 --> 00:19:12,586
- Yes. You do wear so many hats.

415
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,154
Thank you, Edwina,
you're a life saver.

416
00:19:17,068 --> 00:19:19,201
- You know, your uncle's
old home is hardly a matter

417
00:19:19,245 --> 00:19:20,550
that requires your attention

418
00:19:20,594 --> 00:19:22,509
a week before your coronation.

419
00:19:22,552 --> 00:19:24,337
- This place means
a great deal to me.

420
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,295
Anyways, you know the law,
Father.

421
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:29,603
A king cannot own or inherit
land outside of the kingdom,

422
00:19:29,646 --> 00:19:30,865
so this place must be sold

423
00:19:30,908 --> 00:19:33,128
next week
before I take the crown.

424
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,175
Now, please, let's not quibble
about this any more.

425
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:38,046
- At least we agree on that.

426
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:40,091
Knock, knock!
- Come in.

427
00:19:40,135 --> 00:19:42,529
- 7:05 A.M.

428
00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:45,053
- What is that?

429
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,360
- It's my breakfast, I think?

430
00:19:47,403 --> 00:19:49,449
- Sorry, Your Highness,
the toaster is tricky,

431
00:19:49,492 --> 00:19:52,321
and I had a little trouble
making soft-boiled eggs,

432
00:19:52,365 --> 00:19:53,496
so I scrambled them.

433
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,063
- But how did they get so grey?

434
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:56,847
- You know, honestly,
I'm not sure.

435
00:19:56,891 --> 00:19:58,545
But the tea is the right color.

436
00:19:58,588 --> 00:20:00,199
- Thank goodness.

437
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:02,897
- Henry... Who might this be?

438
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,377
- Yes, um...

439
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,727
Emily, this is my f...

440
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,207
Father, this is Emily.

441
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,817
She's the caretaker
at the chalet.

442
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,514
Emily, this is my father,
King William.

443
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:12,863
- Nice to meet you,
Your Majesty.

444
00:20:12,907 --> 00:20:15,301
I'd curtsey, but I might
spill the tray.

445
00:20:15,344 --> 00:20:18,260
- Not to worry.
Your hands are full.

446
00:20:18,304 --> 00:20:20,349
Especially with my stubborn son.

447
00:20:22,656 --> 00:20:23,961
- Is that my morning newspaper?

448
00:20:24,005 --> 00:20:26,442
- Yes! The London Concord.

449
00:20:26,486 --> 00:20:29,402
I... I had to print it
in sections

450
00:20:29,445 --> 00:20:31,404
and tape it together.

451
00:20:31,447 --> 00:20:33,536
Will there be anything else?

452
00:20:35,582 --> 00:20:37,453
- No, I think you've done
quite enough.

453
00:20:37,497 --> 00:20:39,281
- Okie-dokie. Alright.

454
00:20:39,325 --> 00:20:41,152
Nice to meet you, Your Majesty.

455
00:20:42,937 --> 00:20:44,982
That was my pen.

456
00:20:45,026 --> 00:20:46,288
- Now, Father,

457
00:20:46,332 --> 00:20:48,203
as far as the meeting
of the Lords on Friday,

458
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,726
I was thinking
that would be a good time

459
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,250
to discuss the treaty.

460
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:54,601
- About that, I spoke
with the ambassador last night,

461
00:20:54,644 --> 00:20:56,603
and I have some very
crucial information.

462
00:20:56,646 --> 00:20:58,866
Apparently--

463
00:20:58,909 --> 00:21:02,304
- Yes? About that, what?
Fritz, we lost him again!

464
00:21:02,348 --> 00:21:04,045
- Got it!

465
00:21:04,088 --> 00:21:06,221
- Someone seems to have knocked
the power cord loose, sir.

466
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:09,180
- Well, who the devil did that?

467
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,400
- Oops.

468
00:21:11,444 --> 00:21:13,359
- Oops?

469
00:21:13,402 --> 00:21:15,752
We were just discussing
important matters of the state.

470
00:21:15,796 --> 00:21:17,711
- Give me two minutes, you'll be
back online with him, sir.

471
00:21:17,754 --> 00:21:19,843
- Okay.
- Sorry, Your Highness.

472
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:21,889
- It's...

473
00:21:21,932 --> 00:21:23,412
- I just...

474
00:21:23,456 --> 00:21:25,022
I just don't get why...

475
00:21:25,066 --> 00:21:26,285
you'd fly all the way here

476
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:27,764
just to have all these
meetings back home.

477
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,333
- What if I told you
I'm on holiday?

478
00:21:31,377 --> 00:21:34,031
- If this is you on holiday,
I'd hate to see you working.

479
00:21:34,815 --> 00:21:36,295
- If you must know,

480
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:38,035
I'm here to sell the chalet.

481
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:39,646
The sooner, the better.

482
00:21:41,212 --> 00:21:43,302
Or don't you understand
deadlines?

483
00:21:44,128 --> 00:21:46,174
- Well, that's one thing
I do understand.

484
00:21:46,957 --> 00:21:48,481
Excuse me, Your Highness.

485
00:21:50,613 --> 00:21:52,267
- Ooh, there you are, sir.

486
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,877
I'll have you back online
in a jiff.

487
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,158
Ha!

488
00:22:18,424 --> 00:22:20,382
- What in the world?!

489
00:22:22,993 --> 00:22:24,560
Ha!

490
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,397
Excuse me?

491
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:37,747
- Ha!

492
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,271
- Excuse me, hello!

493
00:22:40,315 --> 00:22:42,839
Break!
- Good one, sir.

494
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:46,365
- Yes, what is it?

495
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:47,975
- Sorry to bother you. Um...

496
00:22:48,018 --> 00:22:49,716
- And now that you have?

497
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:52,632
- Well... You guys
are doing amazing...

498
00:22:52,675 --> 00:22:53,850
...by the way.

499
00:22:53,894 --> 00:22:55,243
I'm just wondering
if there's a way

500
00:22:55,286 --> 00:22:56,462
this can work for all of us.

501
00:22:56,505 --> 00:22:58,115
Like, how much long
will it be?

502
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,682
Or can you do it more quietly?

503
00:23:02,032 --> 00:23:04,383
- I have precisely, uh...

504
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:05,819
- Thirteen minutes.
- Thirteen minutes

505
00:23:05,862 --> 00:23:07,298
for my workout, and you want us

506
00:23:07,342 --> 00:23:08,865
to fence more quietly?

507
00:23:08,909 --> 00:23:10,258
- Thirteen minutes?
That's great.

508
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:11,781
No, never mind then. I-I just...

509
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:13,957
Trying to get some writing done,
and it sounds like pirates

510
00:23:14,001 --> 00:23:15,089
have taken over the house.

511
00:23:15,132 --> 00:23:16,743
- Pirates.

512
00:23:16,786 --> 00:23:20,007
I'll have you know that fencing
is one of the oldest

513
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:22,488
and most difficult sports
in the entire world.

514
00:23:22,531 --> 00:23:23,967
- As difficult
as trying to write

515
00:23:24,011 --> 00:23:25,665
while pirates are playing
outside your door?

516
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:28,929
- Fencing is like chess
in motion.

517
00:23:28,972 --> 00:23:31,888
It is... It is sparring
with steel.

518
00:23:31,932 --> 00:23:34,108
- And writing is sparring
with words.

519
00:23:35,326 --> 00:23:37,807
And I think I just
got the last word in.

520
00:23:37,851 --> 00:23:39,287
Hmm.

521
00:23:44,248 --> 00:23:46,425
- Double time, even louder.

522
00:23:51,517 --> 00:23:53,475
- Evening, miss.
- Hey, Fritz.

523
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:54,650
How was your day?

524
00:23:54,694 --> 00:23:56,173
- Oh, fine.

525
00:23:56,217 --> 00:23:58,785
His Highness is very busy.
Diplomatic calls,

526
00:23:58,828 --> 00:24:02,310
heads of state, tutoring
sessions on royal affairs.

527
00:24:02,353 --> 00:24:04,660
Is there something you need?
You look a bit out of sorts.

528
00:24:04,704 --> 00:24:07,184
- Oh, yeah, I'm just looking
for something.

529
00:24:08,185 --> 00:24:10,144
My idea book!

530
00:24:11,362 --> 00:24:13,539
- Oh, oh no! I'm so sorry!

531
00:24:13,582 --> 00:24:15,889
Oh, Henry was cold!
I thought it was scrap!

532
00:24:15,932 --> 00:24:17,238
Oh, I really am sorry!

533
00:24:17,281 --> 00:24:18,761
- What is all the ruckus?!

534
00:24:18,805 --> 00:24:20,894
- My notebook is in the fire!

535
00:24:20,937 --> 00:24:23,200
- Fritz! Be a good fellow.

536
00:24:23,244 --> 00:24:25,507
Go get some clean rags.
- Yes, sir.

537
00:24:26,813 --> 00:24:28,554
Oh! Uh...

538
00:24:33,341 --> 00:24:34,777
- Sorry about that.

539
00:24:34,821 --> 00:24:36,213
What was this anyway?

540
00:24:36,257 --> 00:24:39,869
- It's where I jot down my ideas
and it's ruined!

541
00:24:39,913 --> 00:24:42,481
- Oh gosh, I'm so sorry.

542
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:44,047
Well, uh...

543
00:24:45,048 --> 00:24:46,528
Um...

544
00:24:46,572 --> 00:24:49,705
Surely, you can come up
with some new ideas.

545
00:24:50,271 --> 00:24:51,707
- Ideas aren't like crumpets!

546
00:24:51,751 --> 00:24:53,274
You can't just
send out for more!

547
00:24:57,191 --> 00:24:59,585
Oh, this is funny to you, huh?

548
00:24:59,628 --> 00:25:02,109
- No, I...

549
00:25:02,152 --> 00:25:03,850
I'm so sorry.

550
00:25:03,893 --> 00:25:05,504
A thousand pardons.

551
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:10,030
- Um, you know what?
You look...

552
00:25:10,073 --> 00:25:11,553
Uh...

553
00:25:11,597 --> 00:25:14,295
You look lovely tonight,
Your Highness.

554
00:25:14,338 --> 00:25:15,731
Good night.

555
00:25:16,645 --> 00:25:18,038
- Uh...

556
00:25:19,692 --> 00:25:21,302
- She certainly speaks her mind.

557
00:25:21,345 --> 00:25:22,651
- Yes, she does.

558
00:25:22,695 --> 00:25:24,479
Should Ms. Tilson
speak to her, sir?

559
00:25:25,045 --> 00:25:26,873
- Actually...

560
00:25:26,916 --> 00:25:28,570
no.

561
00:25:29,615 --> 00:25:31,573
- You have a...
- What?

562
00:25:32,879 --> 00:25:34,228
- Never mind.

563
00:25:34,271 --> 00:25:36,143
- Ah.

564
00:25:45,631 --> 00:25:48,938
- Hey, Fritz.
- There you are. Wasn't sure.

565
00:25:48,982 --> 00:25:52,246
- Here and getting nowhere
with my writing.

566
00:25:52,289 --> 00:25:54,161
- Well, I hate to distract,

567
00:25:54,204 --> 00:25:55,945
but Ms. Tilson has asked
to see you.

568
00:25:55,989 --> 00:25:57,773
- Summoned, am I?

569
00:25:58,557 --> 00:25:59,819
I'll be right there.

570
00:25:59,862 --> 00:26:00,950
- Thank you.

571
00:26:08,305 --> 00:26:10,438
- Ms. Tilson, you rang?

572
00:26:10,481 --> 00:26:14,529
- Yes. The prince went into town
on some errands,

573
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:17,184
but it's Tuesday,
and on Tuesday,

574
00:26:17,227 --> 00:26:19,926
the prince enjoys fresh
croissant and jam

575
00:26:19,969 --> 00:26:21,362
with is afternoon tea.

576
00:26:21,405 --> 00:26:23,625
- Where would I possibly
find fresh croissants?

577
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:25,279
- Surely you can get them
in town.

578
00:26:25,322 --> 00:26:27,977
- It's a very small town.
- You are the caretaker.

579
00:26:28,021 --> 00:26:30,458
So please, take care of it.

580
00:26:33,156 --> 00:26:35,550
- Croissants? Sorry.

581
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,596
We don't get much call
for them around here.

582
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:41,600
But I do make pretzels too,
if you like treats with a twist.

583
00:26:42,165 --> 00:26:44,603
- No thank you. I'm in a bit
of a croissant emergency.

584
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:46,039
It's a long story.

585
00:26:46,082 --> 00:26:47,910
- You look familiar.

586
00:26:47,954 --> 00:26:49,346
Have we met before?

587
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:51,610
- I don't think so.
I just got here this week.

588
00:26:51,653 --> 00:26:53,220
- In town to do some skiing?

589
00:26:53,263 --> 00:26:54,656
- I wish.

590
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,137
I'm the temporary caretaker
up at that big chalet

591
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,747
on Skyview.

592
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:01,097
I'm trying to get
some writing done.

593
00:27:01,141 --> 00:27:02,490
I'm an author.

594
00:27:02,533 --> 00:27:05,493
- You don't say!
Anything I may have heard of?

595
00:27:05,536 --> 00:27:08,496
- Just one novel so far.
Romance in the Rockies?

596
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:11,804
- Stay right there!

597
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,940
- What?!
- I love Romance in
the Rockies!

598
00:27:17,984 --> 00:27:19,725
It's the best book
I've read this year!

599
00:27:19,768 --> 00:27:21,857
- Amazing! I'm so glad
you like it!

600
00:27:22,379 --> 00:27:26,166
- About that, Emily Miller
right here in my donut shop!

601
00:27:27,384 --> 00:27:29,386
- So when's your next book
coming out?

602
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:32,172
- As soon as I can get past
my writer's block, I'm afraid.

603
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:35,392
- How do you come up with
the stories you write anyway?

604
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:38,091
- That's a good question.

605
00:27:38,134 --> 00:27:41,137
Sometimes, inspiration comes
easily, and...

606
00:27:41,181 --> 00:27:42,661
sometimes it doesn't.

607
00:27:43,618 --> 00:27:46,534
But every now and then,
a spark just kind of pops up

608
00:27:46,577 --> 00:27:47,535
out of nowhere.

609
00:27:49,232 --> 00:27:51,713
Speaking of which...

610
00:27:51,757 --> 00:27:54,368
Are you making fresh
donuts any time soon?

611
00:27:54,411 --> 00:27:56,979
- I was just about to make
a batch when you came in here.

612
00:27:57,023 --> 00:27:59,416
- Think you could twist
a few into a croissant shape?

613
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:02,768
- Oh, I see where
you're going with this.

614
00:28:02,811 --> 00:28:05,248
Well, because I liked
your book so much,

615
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:07,686
I'll give it a try.
- Yes!

616
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:09,992
- Got it.
- Thank you!

617
00:28:14,518 --> 00:28:17,783
- Ah, Wilson.
Thank you for meeting me here.

618
00:28:17,826 --> 00:28:19,741
Dreadfully sorry to keep
you waiting.

619
00:28:19,785 --> 00:28:22,178
Um, as I was saying
over the phone,

620
00:28:22,222 --> 00:28:24,050
I need work to start right away.

621
00:28:24,093 --> 00:28:26,574
Extremely fast, in fact.

622
00:28:26,617 --> 00:28:29,272
The house is starting
to be shown on Friday,

623
00:28:29,316 --> 00:28:32,145
which means the work must be
done by then at the chalet.

624
00:28:32,188 --> 00:28:35,061
- Okay, well, you sign
the check, and I'll get at it.

625
00:28:35,104 --> 00:28:38,020
Uh, here's the estimate
for the materials.

626
00:28:38,064 --> 00:28:40,457
As you can see,
we've got drywall,

627
00:28:40,501 --> 00:28:41,850
paint, et cetera.

628
00:28:41,894 --> 00:28:44,026
- Ah...

629
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:47,726
Well, this seems a bit high.

630
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:50,816
Especially here, this
five-figure start work fee?

631
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:53,688
- Well, you wanted a rush job,
and I got more work

632
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:54,907
than I can handle.

633
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,604
Plus, I gotta charge you
a little bit extra

634
00:28:56,647 --> 00:28:58,084
to put you to the front
of the line,

635
00:28:58,127 --> 00:28:59,999
and materials are expensive.

636
00:29:00,042 --> 00:29:01,783
If you look at...
- Oh.

637
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,223
- What are you doing here?

638
00:29:07,267 --> 00:29:09,182
- Uh, I was just picking up
some things.

639
00:29:09,225 --> 00:29:12,533
- Oh, um... Mr. Wilson,
this is Emily Miller.

640
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,622
Emily's helping us out
at the chalet.

641
00:29:14,665 --> 00:29:15,797
- Hi.
- Hi.

642
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:17,190
I couldn't help but hear.

643
00:29:17,233 --> 00:29:18,713
That's great that you're so
in demand,

644
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:19,758
Mr. Wilson.

645
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:21,629
- Yeah, my crew and I,

646
00:29:21,672 --> 00:29:23,674
we just put up a roof
down the road.

647
00:29:23,718 --> 00:29:26,155
And we're working on a driveway
this morning.

648
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:27,417
So we're pretty busy.

649
00:29:27,461 --> 00:29:28,636
- Really?

650
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:30,290
That's... That's amazing,

651
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:33,119
'cause usually, putting in
a new roof causes some calluses,

652
00:29:33,162 --> 00:29:35,948
and your hands look great!

653
00:29:35,991 --> 00:29:37,340
That's a good job.

654
00:29:37,384 --> 00:29:39,168
- Oh, uh...

655
00:29:39,212 --> 00:29:41,823
I wear really good gloves.

656
00:29:41,867 --> 00:29:43,651
- Oh. Okay.

657
00:29:43,694 --> 00:29:45,392
Same brand as your boots?

658
00:29:46,654 --> 00:29:48,917
It's just, for most people,

659
00:29:48,961 --> 00:29:51,224
putting in a new driveway
would cause their boots

660
00:29:51,267 --> 00:29:54,227
to get covered in tar,
and yours look really clean.

661
00:29:54,967 --> 00:29:56,664
That's really something.

662
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,710
But anyway, if you can't waive
the big start fee,

663
00:29:59,754 --> 00:30:01,843
no hard feelings. We'll just go
with the guy yesterday.

664
00:30:01,887 --> 00:30:03,366
The estimate
was lower, right? Yeah.

665
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:06,239
And you're so busy anyway,
so, it's nice to meet you.

666
00:30:06,282 --> 00:30:09,546
- Well, I'm sure
there's a little bit

667
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,026
of wiggle room in there.

668
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:14,508
Um, I can, you know, uh...

669
00:30:14,551 --> 00:30:16,771
Uh, no, I'm waiving the fee.

670
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,339
- Wow.
- I'll waive the fee. Yeah.

671
00:30:19,382 --> 00:30:22,429
- Okay, good. Good. Good.

672
00:30:23,386 --> 00:30:26,389
But these look like retail
prices for paint and lumber.

673
00:30:26,433 --> 00:30:28,087
Oh, but with your
contractor's discount,

674
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:30,263
we'll get like, what,
20 percent off?

675
00:30:35,224 --> 00:30:37,009
Sorry to meddle, Your Highness.

676
00:30:37,052 --> 00:30:39,402
I just couldn't stand there
and watch him take advantage

677
00:30:39,446 --> 00:30:40,882
of a naiïve...

678
00:30:40,926 --> 00:30:43,189
of, uh, a newcomer.

679
00:30:43,232 --> 00:30:46,845
- What makes you assume
that I'm some naiïve newcomer?

680
00:30:48,934 --> 00:30:49,978
- Well, for starters,

681
00:30:50,022 --> 00:30:52,024
if a contractor sees
you've got money,

682
00:30:52,067 --> 00:30:53,852
he may try to take it.

683
00:30:53,895 --> 00:30:55,375
So before you negotiate
next time,

684
00:30:55,418 --> 00:30:57,681
you might want to park
your fancy sports utility wagon

685
00:30:57,725 --> 00:30:58,900
down the street.

686
00:30:58,944 --> 00:31:00,902
- Yes, though,

687
00:31:00,946 --> 00:31:02,164
I see your point.

688
00:31:03,078 --> 00:31:06,299
And how come you know
so much about all that, um...

689
00:31:06,342 --> 00:31:07,778
work business?

690
00:31:07,822 --> 00:31:09,998
- Before I was an author,
I was actually an accountant

691
00:31:10,042 --> 00:31:12,087
for a big construction firm
in Denver.

692
00:31:12,131 --> 00:31:14,916
- Ah. Well, you were
very impressive.

693
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,223
Oh, before I forget.

694
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:21,096
This is for you.

695
00:31:21,836 --> 00:31:24,056
To replace the one
that went up in smoke.

696
00:31:24,099 --> 00:31:26,101
It may not have any
ideas in it yet,

697
00:31:26,145 --> 00:31:28,016
but given how quickly
you think on your feet,

698
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,888
I'm sure it'll be filled up
in no time.

699
00:31:30,801 --> 00:31:32,194
- Thank you so much.

700
00:31:33,456 --> 00:31:35,197
- Oh no. Shh!
- What?

701
00:31:35,241 --> 00:31:36,677
- Oh, God.
- What is it?

702
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,113
- Um, it's...

703
00:31:38,157 --> 00:31:39,680
Nigel Bolan.

704
00:31:39,723 --> 00:31:40,986
He's a photo-taking gadfly

705
00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:42,857
for the Concordian
gossip pages.

706
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,903
What's he doing here?
Oh, God.

707
00:31:44,946 --> 00:31:46,817
- Oh, maybe he's on vacation?

708
00:31:46,861 --> 00:31:49,255
- Ah, well, it's a little far
to go for skiing,

709
00:31:49,298 --> 00:31:51,126
but not for a photo.
He's coming this way, hurry.

710
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,954
- Okay.
- Um... How about some brunch?

711
00:31:52,998 --> 00:31:54,738
- Um, sure.

712
00:31:54,782 --> 00:31:56,088
- This way.

713
00:31:58,742 --> 00:32:01,180
- You didn't have to do
all this, Your Highness.

714
00:32:01,223 --> 00:32:02,572
- It's the last I can do.

715
00:32:02,616 --> 00:32:04,313
And you don't have to call me
"Your Highness".

716
00:32:04,357 --> 00:32:07,447
- Oh. Is it your lordship then,
Your Highness?

717
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:08,970
- Actually, just...

718
00:32:09,014 --> 00:32:10,667
plain "Henry" will do.

719
00:32:10,711 --> 00:32:13,583
- There's nothing plain
about you, but...

720
00:32:13,627 --> 00:32:15,934
I'll give it a try...

721
00:32:15,977 --> 00:32:17,109
Henry.

722
00:32:17,718 --> 00:32:19,502
- That's better.

723
00:32:20,025 --> 00:32:22,462
- So, why such lengths
to avoid Nigel?

724
00:32:22,505 --> 00:32:25,378
- He twists the simplest things
into scandals.

725
00:32:25,421 --> 00:32:27,293
Like my coming here,
he would spin it

726
00:32:27,336 --> 00:32:29,208
into some sort of
frivolous trip.

727
00:32:29,251 --> 00:32:31,775
- But why did you come here
yourself to sell the chalet?

728
00:32:31,819 --> 00:32:34,561
I mean, a guy like you could
just wave your royal scepter

729
00:32:34,604 --> 00:32:35,997
and say, "Get it done!"

730
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:38,130
- Well, I think you're
confusing a scepter

731
00:32:38,173 --> 00:32:39,609
with a magic wand.

732
00:32:39,653 --> 00:32:41,002
And anyway,

733
00:32:41,046 --> 00:32:42,961
it's... it's complicated.

734
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:47,487
- Well, I like a good story.
Try me.

735
00:32:49,445 --> 00:32:52,709
- My Uncle Chauncey built
this chalet years ago

736
00:32:52,753 --> 00:32:55,669
to escape the pressures
of the palace back home.

737
00:32:56,844 --> 00:32:58,628
And if the Winter Palace
must be sold,

738
00:32:58,672 --> 00:33:01,718
I need to ensure that it's sold
to the right buyer.

739
00:33:01,762 --> 00:33:03,677
- The Winter Palace?

740
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,158
- Yes, it's my uncle's nickname
for the chalet.

741
00:33:06,201 --> 00:33:08,682
- Sounds like a place where
kings and queens hold court.

742
00:33:08,725 --> 00:33:10,379
- No, no, quite the contrary.

743
00:33:10,423 --> 00:33:12,729
Chauncey's door was open to all.

744
00:33:12,773 --> 00:33:15,819
No matter who you were,
royal or local,

745
00:33:15,863 --> 00:33:17,691
as soon as you walked
through that door,

746
00:33:17,734 --> 00:33:20,128
he made you feel like a king.

747
00:33:20,172 --> 00:33:23,349
For instance, if a local couple
couldn't afford to get married,

748
00:33:23,392 --> 00:33:26,308
Chauncey would grant them
the use of his little chapel.

749
00:33:27,266 --> 00:33:29,398
- So, what became
of Uncle Chauncey?

750
00:33:29,442 --> 00:33:30,965
- He passed away.

751
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,402
Uh, five years ago.

752
00:33:33,446 --> 00:33:35,100
That was the last time
I was here.

753
00:33:35,143 --> 00:33:36,927
- I'm sorry.

754
00:33:37,928 --> 00:33:40,801
- He was in line for the crown,
but he stepped aside.

755
00:33:42,063 --> 00:33:43,543
My father became king,

756
00:33:43,586 --> 00:33:45,066
and now,
with my father retiring,

757
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:47,242
I'm to be made king.

758
00:33:47,286 --> 00:33:49,940
So, all I can do is...

759
00:33:49,984 --> 00:33:53,161
ensure that this place
is sold to the right buyer.

760
00:33:53,205 --> 00:33:56,077
Someone who appreciates it
as much as I do.

761
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,775
And all by the end of the week.

762
00:34:01,343 --> 00:34:03,302
And I suppose I...

763
00:34:04,694 --> 00:34:06,957
I needed to see it
one last time.

764
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,180
- You are not at all
what I expected

765
00:34:12,224 --> 00:34:14,313
a prince to be like.
- Oh, yes?

766
00:34:14,356 --> 00:34:17,533
And what did you expect
a prince to be like?

767
00:34:17,577 --> 00:34:19,448
- I guess I thought
you would just be doing

768
00:34:19,492 --> 00:34:21,711
more prince stuff.

769
00:34:21,755 --> 00:34:23,278
You know?

770
00:34:23,322 --> 00:34:25,411
Shouldn't you be out,
you know,

771
00:34:25,454 --> 00:34:27,500
playing polo and dancing
at masquerade balls

772
00:34:27,543 --> 00:34:30,503
instead of working 24/7?

773
00:34:30,546 --> 00:34:32,026
- As prince,

774
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,680
I head up the foreign ministry.

775
00:34:33,723 --> 00:34:37,292
I negotiate treaties,
I propose budgets,

776
00:34:37,336 --> 00:34:39,816
I... And as king,
I'll do even more.

777
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,297
- I can see why you're
so obsessed with schedules.

778
00:34:42,341 --> 00:34:44,125
- You know...

779
00:34:46,171 --> 00:34:48,825
I think we may be able
to help each other.

780
00:34:49,522 --> 00:34:51,654
I need to get this place
ready to be sold

781
00:34:51,698 --> 00:34:53,047
by the end of the week,

782
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,615
and I am disastrously
short-staffed.

783
00:34:55,658 --> 00:34:57,965
And you've clearly proven
yourself resourceful.

784
00:34:58,008 --> 00:34:59,967
- Thank you, but I really
should be writing

785
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,229
whenever I can.

786
00:35:01,273 --> 00:35:03,057
- Well then, let me
propose a treaty to you.

787
00:35:04,276 --> 00:35:06,147
If you help me in the mornings,

788
00:35:06,191 --> 00:35:08,497
you can have the entire
afternoon free to write.

789
00:35:09,194 --> 00:35:11,196
- Okay.

790
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:12,762
But on one condition.

791
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:16,026
No more making fun
of my bunny slippers.

792
00:35:17,332 --> 00:35:18,594
- Hmm...

793
00:35:18,638 --> 00:35:20,509
- Deal?
- Deal.

794
00:35:27,037 --> 00:35:29,562
Alright, Mr. Wilson and his crew

795
00:35:29,605 --> 00:35:31,390
will be here soon to start work
in the living room.

796
00:35:31,433 --> 00:35:33,566
But in the meantime,
I'd like everything

797
00:35:33,609 --> 00:35:35,829
in this room to be catalogued

798
00:35:35,872 --> 00:35:38,962
to either be thrown away,
or donated.

799
00:35:39,006 --> 00:35:40,660
- There's a lot to go through.

800
00:35:40,703 --> 00:35:43,184
- Yes, there is. And...

801
00:35:43,228 --> 00:35:45,795
we're going to start
showing the house on Friday,

802
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:48,450
so I want this room
empty by then.

803
00:35:48,494 --> 00:35:51,192
- But look at these treasures.

804
00:35:51,236 --> 00:35:53,847
Some of this has to be
personal to you.

805
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:56,545
- There's no time
for sentimentality, I'm afraid.

806
00:35:57,198 --> 00:36:00,027
- Stiff upper lip, huh?
- Something like that.

807
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:02,203
- Are you sure you want
to part with all this stuff?

808
00:36:02,247 --> 00:36:04,684
I mean, look at these carvings!

809
00:36:04,727 --> 00:36:07,426
These are amazing!
Who did these?

810
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:11,299
- The name of the artist
escapes me.

811
00:36:11,343 --> 00:36:13,562
You don't honestly
like them, do you?

812
00:36:13,606 --> 00:36:16,174
- I do, they're beautiful!

813
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:17,740
I've always loved sculptures.

814
00:36:17,784 --> 00:36:19,829
What is that quote
from Michelangelo?

815
00:36:19,873 --> 00:36:22,267
Something about how
the sculpture's already inside

816
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:24,094
the block of stone,
and it's just waiting

817
00:36:24,138 --> 00:36:25,139
to be let out!

818
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,141
- Be that as it may,
they can go.

819
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,534
- Okay.

820
00:36:29,274 --> 00:36:30,362
- These can go.

821
00:36:30,405 --> 00:36:33,234
Oh, these chairs, they can go.

822
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,628
- Oh my goodness.

823
00:36:36,368 --> 00:36:37,673
Look at this telescope!

824
00:36:37,717 --> 00:36:40,023
- Oh. Well, I forgot about that.

825
00:36:40,067 --> 00:36:41,982
Yeah.

826
00:36:42,025 --> 00:36:44,114
Chauncey and I used to, uh...

827
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,599
But give it to charity.

828
00:36:50,643 --> 00:36:52,427
And the sooner, the better.

829
00:36:55,517 --> 00:36:58,477
- Hockey! Okay, I...

830
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,914
I love hockey.
I used to play with my dad.

831
00:37:00,957 --> 00:37:02,350
I'm pretty good.

832
00:37:02,394 --> 00:37:04,831
- Yeah, Chauncey and I
used to play in the backyard

833
00:37:04,874 --> 00:37:06,441
using the whole of it as a rink,

834
00:37:06,485 --> 00:37:09,052
even in the summer,
when we'd use pinecones

835
00:37:09,096 --> 00:37:10,924
for pucks.

836
00:37:12,621 --> 00:37:14,971
Uh, but everything can go,
please.

837
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:20,499
- You know, if you're gonna be
giving away all this stuff

838
00:37:20,542 --> 00:37:22,109
to charity,
shouldn't we first make sure

839
00:37:22,152 --> 00:37:23,632
it's in good working condition?

840
00:37:23,676 --> 00:37:25,591
- That's hardly a good use
of our time.

841
00:37:25,634 --> 00:37:28,289
- Could reflect poorly
on Concordia.

842
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:32,075
A matter of national pride,
after all.

843
00:37:38,604 --> 00:37:40,475
Ah, this should do nicely.

844
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:42,564
- I'm not sure
this is a good idea.

845
00:37:42,608 --> 00:37:44,479
- Don't tell me you're afraid
of a little competition.

846
00:37:44,523 --> 00:37:46,046
- What? Oh, please!

847
00:37:46,089 --> 00:37:47,569
Don't make me laugh!

848
00:37:47,613 --> 00:37:49,354
No, no, it's just that, um...

849
00:37:49,397 --> 00:37:53,314
I-I have a call with
the lords at noon, so...

850
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:56,099
- Does Concordia have
a national bird?

851
00:37:56,143 --> 00:37:58,145
- No, why?

852
00:37:58,188 --> 00:38:00,713
- 'Cause it sounds like
someone is chickening out.

853
00:38:00,756 --> 00:38:02,628
- Ha.

854
00:38:02,671 --> 00:38:03,933
- Mm-hmm.

855
00:38:05,979 --> 00:38:08,329
- Uh... Your Highness?

856
00:38:08,373 --> 00:38:09,591
What are you doing?

857
00:38:09,635 --> 00:38:12,725
- I am defending Concordian
national honor!

858
00:38:12,768 --> 00:38:14,640
Or so I'm told.

859
00:38:14,683 --> 00:38:17,164
- But this...
Your schedule is full, sir!

860
00:38:17,207 --> 00:38:19,297
And there's so much work
to be done to prepare

861
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,602
the chalet for sale!

862
00:38:21,777 --> 00:38:23,562
Do something!
- Like what?

863
00:38:23,605 --> 00:38:24,998
- I don't know, anything!

864
00:38:25,041 --> 00:38:27,870
- Sir, shall I hold your hat?
- Uh, no. Thank you.

865
00:38:27,914 --> 00:38:30,046
Oh God!
Good!

866
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:31,613
- Ha!
- Ahh!

867
00:38:33,398 --> 00:38:35,922
Are you alright?
- Yeah. Help.

868
00:38:35,965 --> 00:38:37,227
- Yes, of course.

869
00:38:37,271 --> 00:38:38,490
Oh!
- Ahh!

870
00:38:38,533 --> 00:38:39,752
- Oh, sire!

871
00:38:43,233 --> 00:38:45,453
- How are you not
shivering right now?

872
00:38:45,497 --> 00:38:47,107
- Well...

873
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:49,501
I have a stiff upper lip,
remember?

874
00:38:49,544 --> 00:38:51,111
- Mmm, right, yes.
- Because right now,

875
00:38:51,154 --> 00:38:53,809
it's frozen solid.

876
00:38:56,638 --> 00:38:58,118
- Thank you.

877
00:38:59,032 --> 00:39:01,251
- Sire, if you are quite done,

878
00:39:01,295 --> 00:39:03,776
there's quite a lot of work
to get done today.

879
00:39:03,819 --> 00:39:05,952
Isn't that right, Ms. Miller?

880
00:39:05,995 --> 00:39:07,345
- Yes, right.

881
00:39:07,388 --> 00:39:08,824
Of course.
- Right.

882
00:39:11,218 --> 00:39:13,089
- Thank you.

883
00:39:16,745 --> 00:39:18,878
- Just a different sort
of exercise today,

884
00:39:18,921 --> 00:39:20,401
Ms. Tilson. Surely you approve.

885
00:39:20,445 --> 00:39:22,272
- I'm not sure that I do.

886
00:39:22,316 --> 00:39:25,580
- But... Ms. Miller
is a breath of fresh air.

887
00:39:25,624 --> 00:39:27,190
Wouldn't you say?

888
00:39:27,234 --> 00:39:29,236
- We shall see.

889
00:39:29,279 --> 00:39:31,369
Clean this up, would you?
- Yes, ma'am.

890
00:39:38,463 --> 00:39:40,029
- Ah, Emily.
- Yes.

891
00:39:40,073 --> 00:39:41,335
- Hi.

892
00:39:42,815 --> 00:39:45,513
I trust you've recovered
from today's match.

893
00:39:45,557 --> 00:39:48,037
- I can just feel
my fingers again, yes.

894
00:39:48,081 --> 00:39:49,865
What are you doing up?

895
00:39:51,127 --> 00:39:52,694
- Going over a draft
of the treaty.

896
00:39:52,738 --> 00:39:54,522
When my father steps down
next week,

897
00:39:54,566 --> 00:39:55,958
I have to be ready.

898
00:39:56,002 --> 00:39:57,482
- I thought someone
only becomes king

899
00:39:57,525 --> 00:39:59,309
when an older king passes away.

900
00:39:59,353 --> 00:40:01,747
- Concordians are practical
people.

901
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,313
Our charter states that a king

902
00:40:03,357 --> 00:40:06,316
may abdicate to make room
for the next one,

903
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:10,495
to always ensure a ruler
at the peak of their abilities.

904
00:40:10,538 --> 00:40:11,757
- Hmm.

905
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,673
- I've been...
preparing for years.

906
00:40:17,197 --> 00:40:19,025
- You never stop, do you?

907
00:40:19,068 --> 00:40:20,418
- I can't.

908
00:40:21,854 --> 00:40:24,422
My whole life has been
planned down to the letter.

909
00:40:24,465 --> 00:40:28,426
- And down to a suitable
princess as well, I understand.

910
00:40:28,469 --> 00:40:31,341
A certain Beatrix
from the kingdom next door?

911
00:40:31,385 --> 00:40:32,908
She's very beautiful.

912
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:36,303
- I see you've been
reading online.

913
00:40:36,346 --> 00:40:37,913
- Yes.
- Well...

914
00:40:37,957 --> 00:40:40,394
Uh, Beatrix is no longer
in the picture.

915
00:40:41,482 --> 00:40:42,962
- Oh?

916
00:40:43,005 --> 00:40:44,311
What happened?

917
00:40:44,354 --> 00:40:46,487
- It's complicated.

918
00:40:46,531 --> 00:40:49,316
We're perfect, on paper.

919
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:52,667
Just not in real life,
if that makes sense.

920
00:40:53,276 --> 00:40:55,191
- Believe me, it does.

921
00:40:55,757 --> 00:40:59,108
Yeah, I was dating a guy
in my writing program.

922
00:40:59,152 --> 00:41:01,328
We had everything in common.

923
00:41:01,371 --> 00:41:04,636
But after my first book sold,

924
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:07,900
Michael didn't handle it well.

925
00:41:07,943 --> 00:41:11,425
He was jealous, and he broke up
with me last year.

926
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,471
- Michael doesn't sound
like a gentleman.

927
00:41:15,255 --> 00:41:16,952
I'm sorry.

928
00:41:16,996 --> 00:41:18,998
- I think I'm better
with fiction than real life.

929
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:20,390
- What's that?

930
00:41:20,434 --> 00:41:23,219
- Oh, this is my first chapter.

931
00:41:23,263 --> 00:41:24,656
- Mmm!
- Well, most of it.

932
00:41:24,699 --> 00:41:26,527
I'm stuck on a section.
It helps me to print it

933
00:41:26,571 --> 00:41:27,615
and read it on paper.

934
00:41:27,659 --> 00:41:29,574
- I imagine that's rather
difficult,

935
00:41:29,617 --> 00:41:32,925
making the transition
from accountant to writer.

936
00:41:32,968 --> 00:41:35,493
- Yes. I gave up a very
steady paycheck

937
00:41:35,536 --> 00:41:38,191
for something much less certain.

938
00:41:38,234 --> 00:41:41,324
But... I do love it.

939
00:41:41,368 --> 00:41:43,283
- Still, it must take
a lot of courage.

940
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,546
- Right.

941
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:47,679
- You know, if you'd ever
like a second opinion

942
00:41:47,722 --> 00:41:50,072
on those pages of yours,
I'd be happy to read them.

943
00:41:50,116 --> 00:41:52,597
- Really, I'm fine.
I already have a dozen

944
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,512
competing opinions
in my own head.

945
00:41:54,555 --> 00:41:57,036
- Well surely, another pair
of eyes would help.

946
00:41:58,994 --> 00:42:02,041
- That's so sweet, but you don't
want to read my book.

947
00:42:02,084 --> 00:42:03,912
- I so rarely get
to read for fun,

948
00:42:03,956 --> 00:42:05,958
and I would gladly read
your pages.

949
00:42:06,001 --> 00:42:07,525
If you want.

950
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,918
- Okay.

951
00:42:09,962 --> 00:42:12,312
Okay! Fine.

952
00:42:12,355 --> 00:42:14,444
Take it quick before
I change my mind.

953
00:42:22,365 --> 00:42:25,151
Good morning.
- Ah, good morning.

954
00:42:25,847 --> 00:42:28,763
- What a surprise.
You made your own tea!

955
00:42:28,807 --> 00:42:31,549
Impressive.
- Oh, yes.

956
00:42:32,201 --> 00:42:34,943
Speaking of surprises...

957
00:42:36,597 --> 00:42:38,207
I read your chapter.

958
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:39,818
- And?

959
00:42:39,861 --> 00:42:41,341
- And, uh...

960
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,127
I loved it.

961
00:42:45,171 --> 00:42:47,434
- Really?
- Yes, really.

962
00:42:47,477 --> 00:42:49,697
But there was a problem.
- What?

963
00:42:49,741 --> 00:42:51,656
- It ended halfway through.

964
00:42:53,005 --> 00:42:55,660
- Well, like I told you,
I'm stuck.

965
00:42:55,703 --> 00:42:57,749
- Oh, really.

966
00:42:58,706 --> 00:43:00,142
I have an idea.

967
00:43:00,186 --> 00:43:02,623
Just indulge me.

968
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:05,017
- Does anyone ever do otherwise?

969
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:06,105
- Oh, no.

970
00:43:06,888 --> 00:43:08,194
So...

971
00:43:08,237 --> 00:43:10,762
My Uncle Chauncey and I
used to have this game

972
00:43:10,805 --> 00:43:12,024
to invent stories.

973
00:43:12,067 --> 00:43:14,156
We'd take a snowball,
and we'd pack it

974
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,769
in our bare hands,
and we'd pass it back and forth,

975
00:43:17,812 --> 00:43:19,901
until we thought
of the next phrase,

976
00:43:19,945 --> 00:43:23,383
but you have to do it
without your gloves.

977
00:43:23,426 --> 00:43:26,299
- But that would be freezing!
- Exactly.

978
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:30,999
Ready?
- Sure.

979
00:43:31,043 --> 00:43:33,436
- Alright. Once upon a time...

980
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:35,569
Now, you think
of the next phrase,

981
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,397
and pass it back to me.
- There was a prince.

982
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,529
- Uh... a wise prince.

983
00:43:40,487 --> 00:43:42,315
- Who liked giving orders.

984
00:43:42,358 --> 00:43:43,795
- Um...

985
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:46,711
Uh, until he met
a most disagreeable visitor.

986
00:43:46,754 --> 00:43:50,192
- Who made him apologize
for his atrocious manners.

987
00:43:50,236 --> 00:43:53,935
- Uh, until she realized
that he was deeply insightful,

988
00:43:53,979 --> 00:43:56,198
and the problem, in fact,
lay with her.

989
00:43:56,242 --> 00:43:58,940
- Oh, you!
- Hey!

990
00:44:00,507 --> 00:44:02,596
That's not part of the game!

991
00:44:04,076 --> 00:44:06,252
- Wait...

992
00:44:06,295 --> 00:44:08,210
I just got a great idea
for my chapter.

993
00:44:08,994 --> 00:44:11,126
Uh, I just have to flesh it out.

994
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:13,651
- You see, I told you this game
would knock something loose.

995
00:44:13,694 --> 00:44:16,741
Alright, so go! Write!
Be gone with you!

996
00:44:16,784 --> 00:44:18,177
- Aren't the painters
coming soon?

997
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:19,308
- Don't worry about
the painters.

998
00:44:19,352 --> 00:44:20,875
- Really?
- Yes.

999
00:44:20,919 --> 00:44:22,964
- Thank you. Thank you!

1000
00:45:30,205 --> 00:45:32,164
- What are you doing out here?

1001
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:34,949
- Well, what are you doing
out here?

1002
00:45:34,993 --> 00:45:38,213
- Oh, I'm just finishing up
a sculpture

1003
00:45:38,257 --> 00:45:40,433
I started years ago, and...

1004
00:45:41,303 --> 00:45:43,610
Ah. I suppose I've lost
track of time.

1005
00:45:43,653 --> 00:45:46,265
- What is this? Explain, please.

1006
00:45:46,308 --> 00:45:47,875
- Well, um...

1007
00:45:47,919 --> 00:45:50,312
I thought when this place

1008
00:45:50,356 --> 00:45:52,358
has new buyers, that perhaps

1009
00:45:52,401 --> 00:45:54,316
the owners would like
this little fellow

1010
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,275
living on their deck.
- No, no, I meant

1011
00:45:56,318 --> 00:45:58,843
explain how you made this,
it's beautiful!

1012
00:45:58,886 --> 00:46:00,758
- Ah, it's nothing, really.

1013
00:46:01,236 --> 00:46:05,197
- Nothing? Oh, this
is something, alright.

1014
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,938
Wait a minute.

1015
00:46:09,288 --> 00:46:11,464
Those were your carvings
in the storage room,

1016
00:46:11,507 --> 00:46:12,378
weren't they?

1017
00:46:13,858 --> 00:46:15,773
- It's just a hobby

1018
00:46:15,816 --> 00:46:17,339
from a lifetime ago.

1019
00:46:17,383 --> 00:46:20,212
You know, when I would
visit my uncle,

1020
00:46:20,255 --> 00:46:21,909
and dream of being a sculptor

1021
00:46:21,953 --> 00:46:23,868
and living an artist's life.

1022
00:46:24,607 --> 00:46:26,609
- Well...

1023
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:29,830
Why can't you?

1024
00:46:29,874 --> 00:46:32,485
- Kings don't have much time
for woodworking, I'm afraid,

1025
00:46:32,528 --> 00:46:33,616
for one.

1026
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:35,314
And...

1027
00:46:35,357 --> 00:46:37,316
after my coronation next week,

1028
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:41,799
it's time to put away
childish things.

1029
00:46:42,538 --> 00:46:44,236
- But you have a sister.

1030
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:47,282
Couldn't she take
the throne instead?

1031
00:46:47,326 --> 00:46:49,371
- Edwina's my younger sister,

1032
00:46:49,415 --> 00:46:53,027
and... even though she's always
been a diplomat of sorts...

1033
00:46:54,594 --> 00:46:56,901
Look...

1034
00:46:56,944 --> 00:47:01,166
My country is expecting
me to rule.

1035
00:47:01,209 --> 00:47:03,081
And I can't let them down.

1036
00:47:03,124 --> 00:47:05,910
- So you'd sacrifice
your happiness

1037
00:47:05,953 --> 00:47:07,476
and become king?

1038
00:47:08,173 --> 00:47:10,001
- It's my royal destiny.

1039
00:47:11,045 --> 00:47:13,352
And what's my happiness
compared to the happiness

1040
00:47:13,395 --> 00:47:15,267
of a half a million people?

1041
00:47:16,355 --> 00:47:18,748
- I may have misjudged you
a bit.

1042
00:47:21,926 --> 00:47:24,537
Look, if this is your
last chance to enjoy

1043
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:26,191
the Winter Palace,

1044
00:47:26,234 --> 00:47:28,236
maybe you should try
to have some fun.

1045
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,759
Same goes for your staff.

1046
00:47:29,803 --> 00:47:31,283
- How do you mean?

1047
00:47:31,326 --> 00:47:33,198
- You guys all work so hard,

1048
00:47:33,241 --> 00:47:36,810
and if this is your last
time here,

1049
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,638
why not try to enjoy it?

1050
00:47:41,336 --> 00:47:44,470
Isn't that what your uncle
would've wanted?

1051
00:47:45,993 --> 00:47:47,734
- Yes.

1052
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:50,519
Yes, he would.

1053
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:55,176
You know, you're a bit of a...

1054
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:56,917
- Nuisance?
- No.

1055
00:47:56,961 --> 00:47:59,224
I was going to say inspiration.

1056
00:48:00,051 --> 00:48:02,880
And I will give
your words some thought.

1057
00:48:03,793 --> 00:48:05,056
Thank you.

1058
00:48:06,057 --> 00:48:07,710
- 'Til tomorrow then.

1059
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:38,480
- What is this?

1060
00:48:38,524 --> 00:48:41,135
- Better take a look,
Ms. Tilson.

1061
00:48:41,179 --> 00:48:45,183
- 10:45, spin class
and a spa day?

1062
00:48:45,226 --> 00:48:46,358
What is this?!

1063
00:48:46,401 --> 00:48:47,968
- I had one just like it
waiting for me.

1064
00:48:48,012 --> 00:48:50,884
Though mine said skiing
instead of spa day,

1065
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:53,974
and a class in origami,
whatever that is.

1066
00:48:54,018 --> 00:48:55,976
- This is someone's
idea of a joke?

1067
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:57,238
- Quite the contrary.

1068
00:48:57,282 --> 00:49:00,024
- Ms. Tilson, you've made
schedules every day

1069
00:49:00,067 --> 00:49:01,460
for me since I was five.

1070
00:49:01,503 --> 00:49:04,202
- Well yes, that is my job,
to keep you on task,

1071
00:49:04,245 --> 00:49:05,725
and you have meetings today.

1072
00:49:05,768 --> 00:49:07,422
- Oh, I cancelled them.

1073
00:49:07,466 --> 00:49:09,076
- No, you haven't.

1074
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,035
- I have the rest of my life
for meetings.

1075
00:49:11,078 --> 00:49:14,473
This week, I am on vacation.

1076
00:49:14,516 --> 00:49:16,605
And some things will just
have to wait.

1077
00:49:16,649 --> 00:49:18,912
- What I think he's trying
to say is that both of you

1078
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:20,653
deserve a little fun!

1079
00:49:20,696 --> 00:49:21,784
So, Fritz...

1080
00:49:21,828 --> 00:49:24,265
lift ticket and origami class.

1081
00:49:24,309 --> 00:49:26,006
And Ms. Tilson, the spin class
starts soon,

1082
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:27,660
don't be late.

1083
00:49:27,703 --> 00:49:29,618
And the spa is expecting you
after that.

1084
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,274
- But the diplomatic pouch
just arrived,

1085
00:49:33,318 --> 00:49:35,102
and the workers need
to be supervised.

1086
00:49:35,146 --> 00:49:38,062
- Ms. Tilson. Are you disobeying
a royal order?

1087
00:49:38,105 --> 00:49:39,672
- No, of course not.
- Good.

1088
00:49:39,715 --> 00:49:41,848
Then Ms. Tilson, Fritz,

1089
00:49:41,891 --> 00:49:43,284
enjoy your day off.

1090
00:49:45,895 --> 00:49:47,332
- Ah...

1091
00:49:48,289 --> 00:49:50,030
- Hmm. That went well.

1092
00:49:50,074 --> 00:49:51,640
- Remains to be seen.

1093
00:49:51,684 --> 00:49:53,294
- And what about you?

1094
00:49:53,338 --> 00:49:56,036
What will the prince
do for fun?

1095
00:49:56,906 --> 00:50:00,040
- I figured I'd help out
Wilson, here.

1096
00:50:00,084 --> 00:50:02,695
That is, if you'll have me,
good man.

1097
00:50:02,738 --> 00:50:05,828
- Lucky me.
- Yes, indeed.

1098
00:50:05,872 --> 00:50:08,048
- If you really want to help me,
there's a few supplies

1099
00:50:08,092 --> 00:50:10,181
you can get in town.
- Oh, fantastic.

1100
00:50:11,617 --> 00:50:14,620
Emily, since you're not
writing 'til later,

1101
00:50:14,663 --> 00:50:16,056
perhaps you care
to accompany me.

1102
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,232
- I would love to.

1103
00:50:25,544 --> 00:50:28,286
- So, how's your book coming?
- It's going great.

1104
00:50:28,329 --> 00:50:30,027
- Well, clearly your
writer's block came

1105
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:32,116
from you working too hard,
and you just needed

1106
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:33,508
to have some more fun.

1107
00:50:33,552 --> 00:50:34,727
- Wait a minute.

1108
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:36,990
Suddenly you're the expert
in fun?

1109
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:38,296
Mr. Works-all-the-time?

1110
00:50:38,339 --> 00:50:41,386
- Listen, I am the most fun.

1111
00:50:41,429 --> 00:50:42,822
For instance, I can do this.

1112
00:50:45,651 --> 00:50:47,392
- Well, maybe you shouldn't.
- Why not?

1113
00:50:47,435 --> 00:50:48,828
Are you fun-shaming me?

1114
00:50:48,871 --> 00:50:51,396
You're shaming my fun!

1115
00:50:51,439 --> 00:50:53,398
How dare you?

1116
00:50:54,399 --> 00:50:56,140
- You should let your fun side
out more often.

1117
00:50:56,183 --> 00:50:58,403
- Oh yeah? Why should I do that?
Just to get shamed more?

1118
00:50:58,446 --> 00:51:00,057
- You'd probably have
more friends.

1119
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:01,449
- I have plenty of friends.

1120
00:51:01,493 --> 00:51:03,277
The problem is, they all
want something from me.

1121
00:51:03,321 --> 00:51:05,932
Fame, favor, funding.

1122
00:51:05,975 --> 00:51:07,368
The Three Fs.

1123
00:51:08,413 --> 00:51:10,676
But you're very different.

1124
00:51:11,416 --> 00:51:13,287
- I am?
- Yeah.

1125
00:51:13,331 --> 00:51:16,160
You don't seem to want
anything from me at all.

1126
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:21,078
- Well that's...
that's not actually true.

1127
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:23,819
I want the rest of that pretzel.

1128
00:51:23,863 --> 00:51:25,691
- Oh, no, you can't have it.
- I...

1129
00:51:25,734 --> 00:51:27,084
- Shoot, shoot.
- Oh.

1130
00:51:27,127 --> 00:51:29,956
Is it that reporter guy?
- Yes, yes, yes.

1131
00:51:29,999 --> 00:51:32,872
It's Nigel.
Probably up to no good.

1132
00:51:33,786 --> 00:51:35,353
I can just see the headline now.

1133
00:51:35,396 --> 00:51:38,617
Pretzel prince prances
in streets with pretty peasant.

1134
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:41,185
- Excuse me?!
- Sorry. Uh, we should...

1135
00:51:41,228 --> 00:51:43,143
- Yeah, let's just hurry up
and get out of here.

1136
00:51:43,187 --> 00:51:44,666
- It's icy.

1137
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:46,712
Take my hand.

1138
00:51:53,458 --> 00:51:54,981
- I don't think he followed us.

1139
00:51:55,024 --> 00:51:56,156
Ah!

1140
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:13,304
- Ms. Tilson.

1141
00:52:13,347 --> 00:52:15,175
- I could be wrong, sire,

1142
00:52:15,219 --> 00:52:16,742
but I think we have a problem.

1143
00:52:16,785 --> 00:52:18,091
- Clearly.

1144
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:19,484
The prince has been
missing meetings

1145
00:52:19,527 --> 00:52:21,964
and not returning calls.

1146
00:52:22,008 --> 00:52:23,923
This has gone on long enough,
Ms. Tilson.

1147
00:52:23,966 --> 00:52:25,577
- Yes, but what can we do?

1148
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:27,970
- Well, the sooner
that chalet sells,

1149
00:52:28,014 --> 00:52:30,364
the sooner Henry comes home.

1150
00:52:30,408 --> 00:52:32,018
That's all there is to it.

1151
00:52:32,061 --> 00:52:33,628
- Yes, sire.

1152
00:52:33,672 --> 00:52:35,717
Leave it to me.

1153
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:41,332
- So, you replace the screen...
- Uh-huh.

1154
00:52:41,375 --> 00:52:43,595
- And then you put the spline

1155
00:52:43,638 --> 00:52:46,337
in the slot, and...

1156
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:48,469
Uh...

1157
00:52:48,513 --> 00:52:50,210
- It's done!
- Well done.

1158
00:52:50,254 --> 00:52:51,907
- Most ingenious.

1159
00:52:51,951 --> 00:52:54,214
- So now you're doing
home repairs?

1160
00:52:54,258 --> 00:52:55,955
- Well, at the palace,
they won't let me

1161
00:52:55,998 --> 00:52:57,217
touch a thing.

1162
00:52:57,261 --> 00:52:58,697
So now, the next time
something breaks,

1163
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:00,220
I won't have to call
the repairman.

1164
00:53:00,264 --> 00:53:02,701
No offense.

1165
00:53:03,571 --> 00:53:05,094
- Ms. Tilson!

1166
00:53:05,138 --> 00:53:07,227
How was your spa day?

1167
00:53:07,271 --> 00:53:08,794
- Perplexing.

1168
00:53:08,837 --> 00:53:12,798
I had some sort of treatment
involving guacamole.

1169
00:53:12,841 --> 00:53:14,365
Or was it guava?

1170
00:53:14,408 --> 00:53:17,063
- Well, whatever it was,
you look wonderful.

1171
00:53:19,935 --> 00:53:21,328
Who could that be?

1172
00:53:21,372 --> 00:53:24,157
- Oh dear, I had a message
from the real estate agent

1173
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,898
while I was at the spa.

1174
00:53:25,941 --> 00:53:27,987
They've sent a potential buyer!

1175
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:29,597
Apparently,
he's very interested.

1176
00:53:29,641 --> 00:53:31,512
- But it's two days early,
we're not ready.

1177
00:53:31,556 --> 00:53:33,558
- Well, I may have indicated
to the agent

1178
00:53:33,601 --> 00:53:36,213
our intense timeline, sir.

1179
00:53:36,256 --> 00:53:38,780
But don't worry,
I will take care of it.

1180
00:53:38,824 --> 00:53:40,565
As you'll do to speak
to the prime minister

1181
00:53:40,608 --> 00:53:42,393
in ten minutes.
- Reschedule that, please.

1182
00:53:42,436 --> 00:53:44,743
I need to get a sense of who
might be buying this place.

1183
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:49,878
I'll handle it myself.

1184
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:58,583
So, as you can see,
there's quite a bit

1185
00:53:58,626 --> 00:53:59,975
more work to do.

1186
00:54:00,019 --> 00:54:01,977
We weren't quite expecting
you so soon.

1187
00:54:02,021 --> 00:54:04,066
- I don't mind a little
paint and sawdust.

1188
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:06,025
Great place you've got here.

1189
00:54:06,068 --> 00:54:08,462
- Thank you. My uncle
helped build it himself.

1190
00:54:08,506 --> 00:54:10,159
It was a bit of
a passion project.

1191
00:54:10,203 --> 00:54:13,511
In fact, he had these windows
installed at night

1192
00:54:13,554 --> 00:54:14,729
for stargazing.

1193
00:54:14,773 --> 00:54:16,470
- And during the day,
as you can see,

1194
00:54:16,514 --> 00:54:18,298
the light in here is amazing.

1195
00:54:18,342 --> 00:54:20,561
It's perfect for reading,
or just taking in

1196
00:54:20,605 --> 00:54:22,041
this beautiful view.

1197
00:54:22,084 --> 00:54:23,782
- Nice.

1198
00:54:23,825 --> 00:54:26,132
Of course, I'd have
to make some changes.

1199
00:54:26,175 --> 00:54:28,047
- Changes?
- Sure.

1200
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:29,570
Knock out some walls,

1201
00:54:29,614 --> 00:54:31,006
put in a bar.

1202
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:34,314
And this room would be perfect
for a home theater.

1203
00:54:34,358 --> 00:54:36,273
Just have to block out
those windows.

1204
00:54:36,316 --> 00:54:39,319
- But then you'd miss
this gorgeous view.

1205
00:54:39,363 --> 00:54:41,713
- It's a shame.

1206
00:54:41,756 --> 00:54:43,497
But you can't make an omelette
if you don't break

1207
00:54:43,541 --> 00:54:45,194
a couple eggs.

1208
00:54:45,238 --> 00:54:47,196
- Um...

1209
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:50,330
Well, uh, before we proceed
too much further,

1210
00:54:50,374 --> 00:54:52,332
you should be aware
of the risks.

1211
00:54:52,376 --> 00:54:54,987
- Risks?
- Yeah, you know, the hazards.

1212
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:56,728
- What hazards?
- Uh...

1213
00:54:56,771 --> 00:54:59,513
Well, there's the bears,
for one.

1214
00:54:59,557 --> 00:55:02,124
- Bears?
- Oh, they love it here.

1215
00:55:02,168 --> 00:55:04,475
- Why would bears love it here
more than any place else?

1216
00:55:04,518 --> 00:55:06,041
- Oh-ho!

1217
00:55:06,955 --> 00:55:09,306
- It could be because of
all the beehives in the eaves.

1218
00:55:09,349 --> 00:55:11,830
- Mm, yes.

1219
00:55:11,873 --> 00:55:14,136
Full disclosure,
I'm not sure my uncle

1220
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:16,400
got all the permits he needed
to build this place.

1221
00:55:16,443 --> 00:55:17,966
- I'm sure that can be fixed.

1222
00:55:18,010 --> 00:55:19,968
- And of course,
there is the fireplace

1223
00:55:20,012 --> 00:55:21,230
in the main living room.

1224
00:55:21,274 --> 00:55:23,363
Sometimes the chimney
just blows the smoke

1225
00:55:23,407 --> 00:55:25,234
right back in there.
- Mm-hmm.

1226
00:55:25,278 --> 00:55:27,324
- It's like London
in the 50s in there.

1227
00:55:27,367 --> 00:55:31,502
Oh, and then, of course,
there is the roof. It leaks.

1228
00:55:31,545 --> 00:55:32,938
Bad.

1229
00:55:32,981 --> 00:55:35,201
- Are you trying to talk
me into this place

1230
00:55:35,244 --> 00:55:36,985
or out of it? I'm not sure.

1231
00:55:37,029 --> 00:55:39,031
- Look, I'm terribly sorry.

1232
00:55:39,074 --> 00:55:42,817
I... I just don't think
this place is for you.

1233
00:55:44,428 --> 00:55:46,604
- I understand.

1234
00:55:46,647 --> 00:55:48,083
I appreciate your time.

1235
00:55:48,127 --> 00:55:49,955
If you change your mind,
you let me know.

1236
00:55:49,998 --> 00:55:51,304
- Of course.

1237
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,306
- Have a good day.
- You as well.

1238
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:54,612
That's the door.

1239
00:55:54,655 --> 00:55:57,136
Thank you for all those
fascinating stories!

1240
00:56:01,662 --> 00:56:04,448
- You forgot to mention
the potential for meteor impact.

1241
00:56:04,491 --> 00:56:07,451
- Ha. Well, I'll remember that
for when he comes back.

1242
00:56:07,494 --> 00:56:08,800
Thank you for the assist.

1243
00:56:08,843 --> 00:56:11,498
Uh, just simply
not the right buyer.

1244
00:56:11,542 --> 00:56:13,370
- B-But to sell this place soon,

1245
00:56:13,413 --> 00:56:15,023
isn't any buyer the right one?

1246
00:56:15,067 --> 00:56:16,895
- I just need to find someone

1247
00:56:16,938 --> 00:56:19,158
who loves this place
as much as I do.

1248
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:22,553
- I mean, I get it.
Nobody wants to see

1249
00:56:22,596 --> 00:56:24,468
their memories bulldozed.

1250
00:56:24,511 --> 00:56:27,296
And your uncle did help
build this place.

1251
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:28,602
- Yeah.

1252
00:56:28,646 --> 00:56:30,038
Speaking of...

1253
00:56:30,082 --> 00:56:32,867
There is something
that I have been dying to do!

1254
00:56:38,438 --> 00:56:39,874
- Your Highness,

1255
00:56:39,918 --> 00:56:41,485
you've been at this
for a while.

1256
00:56:41,528 --> 00:56:43,574
I really don't think
this is a good idea.

1257
00:56:43,617 --> 00:56:45,532
- Look, if my Uncle Chauncey
could help build

1258
00:56:45,576 --> 00:56:47,752
this entire chalet
with his own two hands,

1259
00:56:47,795 --> 00:56:50,624
then truly, I can change
a light switch or two.

1260
00:56:50,668 --> 00:56:52,452
- But Henry, we don't want
you to get shocked.

1261
00:56:52,496 --> 00:56:54,193
- Ms. Tilson does have a point.

1262
00:56:54,236 --> 00:56:56,238
- Be careful, sir.
- Alright, look.

1263
00:56:56,282 --> 00:56:58,676
I watched Wilson do
one of these earlier,

1264
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:00,982
it is perfectly fine. Alright?

1265
00:57:01,026 --> 00:57:03,507
- So you know what you're doing?
- Obviously.

1266
00:57:04,333 --> 00:57:06,858
I'm almost done. And...

1267
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:08,903
Ahh!

1268
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:10,862
Woops.

1269
00:57:12,254 --> 00:57:14,909
- Hey! Who's up for
a candlelight dinner tonight?

1270
00:57:18,913 --> 00:57:22,090
- So, long story short...

1271
00:57:22,134 --> 00:57:23,831
I must've crossed the wires.

1272
00:57:23,875 --> 00:57:26,225
- Well, I think it all
worked out perfectly.

1273
00:57:26,268 --> 00:57:28,140
This is lovely.

1274
00:57:28,183 --> 00:57:31,273
- I agree. It's a bit romantic,
isn't it?

1275
00:57:31,317 --> 00:57:33,319
Speaking of romantic,

1276
00:57:33,362 --> 00:57:35,843
better clear these dishes.
I have a date later.

1277
00:57:35,887 --> 00:57:38,280
- A what? With who?

1278
00:57:38,324 --> 00:57:40,674
- The ski instructor who gave me
my lessons this morning.

1279
00:57:40,718 --> 00:57:43,764
By the way, sire. I set up
the telescope like you asked.

1280
00:57:43,808 --> 00:57:46,027
- The telescope from storage?

1281
00:57:46,724 --> 00:57:49,117
- Oh, uh, yes. I...

1282
00:57:49,161 --> 00:57:51,598
The mountain air is perfect
for stargazing.

1283
00:57:51,642 --> 00:57:53,470
And it's a clear night, so...

1284
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:55,950
Would you care to join me?

1285
00:57:55,994 --> 00:57:57,778
- Yeah.

1286
00:57:57,822 --> 00:57:59,824
Yeah, I mean, you know,

1287
00:57:59,867 --> 00:58:01,347
maybe I'll get more inspiration.

1288
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:04,481
- But sire, it's chilly out,
and late.

1289
00:58:04,524 --> 00:58:07,048
And none of us
want to catch a cold

1290
00:58:07,092 --> 00:58:08,223
before the coronation.

1291
00:58:08,267 --> 00:58:09,747
- So you can stay warm

1292
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:11,096
by the fire with a book.

1293
00:58:12,445 --> 00:58:14,273
That's a royal order.

1294
00:58:19,844 --> 00:58:21,889
After you.
- Thank you.

1295
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:30,681
- Henry certainly seems
to have lost his focus.

1296
00:58:30,724 --> 00:58:34,989
- Perhaps. But he hasn't smiled
this much in ages.

1297
00:58:38,863 --> 00:58:41,822
- Ms. Tilson means well,
but she and my father

1298
00:58:41,866 --> 00:58:45,826
conspire to protect me
from all this.

1299
00:58:47,045 --> 00:58:48,437
- It's amazing.

1300
00:58:48,481 --> 00:58:50,091
It's like you could see forever.

1301
00:58:50,135 --> 00:58:51,310
- Indeed.

1302
00:58:51,353 --> 00:58:52,659
- Oh, yes.

1303
00:58:52,703 --> 00:58:54,269
Wow.

1304
00:58:56,837 --> 00:58:58,578
- Do you see that star there?

1305
00:58:58,622 --> 00:59:00,014
Right in the heart of Leo?

1306
00:59:00,058 --> 00:59:01,320
- Yes.

1307
00:59:02,147 --> 00:59:04,671
- So that is Regulus.

1308
00:59:05,367 --> 00:59:08,588
My Uncle Chauncey used to say
that that was my star.

1309
00:59:08,632 --> 00:59:11,852
Because Regulus in Latin
means "little prince".

1310
00:59:13,724 --> 00:59:16,378
- In Latin, wouldn't regulus
mean "little king"?

1311
00:59:17,336 --> 00:59:20,034
- Well yes, if you want
to get technical about things.

1312
00:59:20,078 --> 00:59:21,645
I suppose it would
mean little king.

1313
00:59:21,688 --> 00:59:23,647
- Oh, the book
The Little Prince.

1314
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:25,300
The Latin translation
was called...

1315
00:59:25,344 --> 00:59:26,432
Regulus.

1316
00:59:29,391 --> 00:59:31,785
- I think I would've
liked your uncle.

1317
00:59:32,438 --> 00:59:33,918
- You would've.

1318
00:59:34,832 --> 00:59:37,138
His house here was...

1319
00:59:37,182 --> 00:59:38,923
just magic.

1320
00:59:38,966 --> 00:59:41,142
People would come here
and no matter

1321
00:59:41,186 --> 00:59:44,102
what sort of mood they were in,
they would leave happy.

1322
00:59:44,145 --> 00:59:46,321
- Maybe it's working
its magic on me.

1323
00:59:47,453 --> 00:59:50,499
My book seems to be
writing itself.

1324
00:59:50,543 --> 00:59:52,240
- Does that mean
you'll make your deadline?

1325
00:59:52,284 --> 00:59:55,243
- Yes, yes, I think so,
if I keep up this pace.

1326
00:59:55,287 --> 00:59:57,463
I just haven't quite
figured out the end.

1327
00:59:57,506 --> 00:59:59,160
- What about,

1328
00:59:59,204 --> 01:00:02,816
"Journeys end
in lovers meeting"?

1329
01:00:04,252 --> 01:00:06,080
- Your Highness.

1330
01:00:06,864 --> 01:00:10,215
Quoting Shakespeare?
- Oh, it's my favorite.

1331
01:00:10,258 --> 01:00:14,654
It's as true now
as it was 400 years ago.

1332
01:00:15,742 --> 01:00:17,526
And that's what people want.

1333
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:19,964
For a couple to end up together.

1334
01:00:21,139 --> 01:00:23,271
- Sometimes it's easier
said than done.

1335
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:30,627
So...

1336
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:33,107
Three days. You're leaving
in three days, huh?

1337
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:34,587
- It would seem so.

1338
01:00:35,457 --> 01:00:37,677
This coronation business
can't be stopped.

1339
01:00:39,113 --> 01:00:40,985
- Your royal destiny?

1340
01:00:42,943 --> 01:00:45,859
But your future
isn't set in stone.

1341
01:00:47,078 --> 01:00:48,993
Why can't you...

1342
01:00:49,036 --> 01:00:51,082
write your own story?

1343
01:00:52,736 --> 01:00:55,564
- I wish I had your courage.

1344
01:00:57,218 --> 01:00:59,830
- Tonight let's just...

1345
01:00:59,873 --> 01:01:02,093
enjoy the stars.

1346
01:01:06,227 --> 01:01:09,056
- I'm afraid I've been
unsuccessful, Your Majesty.

1347
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:11,668
- I understand.
Henry can be very stubborn.

1348
01:01:12,277 --> 01:01:15,367
You'll have to take
stronger measures.

1349
01:01:20,415 --> 01:01:22,069
- Father...

1350
01:01:22,113 --> 01:01:24,202
The mayors are gathering
for the morning tea downstairs

1351
01:01:24,245 --> 01:01:26,639
in the library.
Weren't you to meet them?

1352
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:28,380
- Yes, Edwina,
I'll be there shortly.

1353
01:01:29,076 --> 01:01:30,643
- Well, it's been quite a week.

1354
01:01:32,123 --> 01:01:33,428
Is something wrong, Father?

1355
01:01:34,255 --> 01:01:36,997
- No. No, I just need to make
some arrangements

1356
01:01:37,041 --> 01:01:39,260
to take care of a...

1357
01:01:39,304 --> 01:01:41,132
a pressing matter.

1358
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:53,710
- Your Highness?

1359
01:01:55,886 --> 01:01:57,931
Is everything alright?

1360
01:02:00,107 --> 01:02:03,676
- I was just thinking
what Chauncey must have felt

1361
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,852
when he first stumbled
upon this place.

1362
01:02:06,897 --> 01:02:09,726
All the possibilities
open to him.

1363
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:13,686
- All is well, sir?

1364
01:02:14,382 --> 01:02:16,428
- Better than well.

1365
01:02:16,471 --> 01:02:18,169
That's the problem.

1366
01:02:19,344 --> 01:02:21,738
For the first time in my life,

1367
01:02:21,781 --> 01:02:25,350
I have a choice
that I never expected.

1368
01:02:26,394 --> 01:02:28,919
A choice like my Uncle Chauncey
had to face.

1369
01:02:31,791 --> 01:02:34,011
- If you don't mind my saying,
sir...

1370
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:37,884
your uncle was a wise man.

1371
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:56,773
- You sure you want to do this?

1372
01:02:56,816 --> 01:02:58,035
- Yes.

1373
01:02:58,078 --> 01:03:00,559
I am determined to make dinner
for everyone,

1374
01:03:00,602 --> 01:03:01,952
just like Chauncey.

1375
01:03:01,995 --> 01:03:04,998
- Yeah, but you really
want to attempt, uh...

1376
01:03:05,042 --> 01:03:07,566
- Beef Wellington. No?

1377
01:03:07,609 --> 01:03:10,612
- I-It just seems like that
would be really challenging.

1378
01:03:10,656 --> 01:03:12,658
- The Duke of Wellington
was a distant relation.

1379
01:03:12,701 --> 01:03:14,791
I'm just hoping
it might come naturally.

1380
01:03:14,834 --> 01:03:16,270
- You know what?

1381
01:03:16,314 --> 01:03:18,969
I could teach you how to make
my world-famous fajitas.

1382
01:03:19,012 --> 01:03:20,448
- That's easier?
- I think so.

1383
01:03:20,492 --> 01:03:22,407
And it's the one thing
I know how to make.

1384
01:03:22,450 --> 01:03:23,800
- Okay.
- Okay.

1385
01:03:26,367 --> 01:03:27,586
Oh.

1386
01:03:27,629 --> 01:03:28,805
- What?

1387
01:03:28,848 --> 01:03:30,154
- Hungry?
- Yeah!

1388
01:03:30,197 --> 01:03:32,896
These are Concordian apples.
Try one!

1389
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,128
- Um...

1390
01:03:48,172 --> 01:03:51,697
- So... that was Emily's recipe.

1391
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:54,743
- But prepared entirely
by Henry.

1392
01:03:55,483 --> 01:03:56,876
- Yes. Haha.

1393
01:03:57,964 --> 01:04:01,446
And I, uh, want to know

1394
01:04:01,489 --> 01:04:03,535
exactly what you think.

1395
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:06,668
Really.
- Really?

1396
01:04:06,712 --> 01:04:08,453
- No holds barred.

1397
01:04:08,496 --> 01:04:10,063
- No holds barred?

1398
01:04:10,107 --> 01:04:13,284
- Absolutely. I'm tired
of being "yessed" all the time.

1399
01:04:15,155 --> 01:04:17,114
- Well, sire,

1400
01:04:17,157 --> 01:04:20,508
I think since you asked us
to speak freely,

1401
01:04:20,552 --> 01:04:23,729
I would, well...

1402
01:04:23,772 --> 01:04:27,211
- You did quite a job
cooking the meat, sir.

1403
01:04:27,254 --> 01:04:29,256
- Yes.
- The texture reminded me

1404
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:30,692
of...

1405
01:04:34,131 --> 01:04:36,481
...a wallet I once owned.

1406
01:04:53,106 --> 01:04:55,108
- Oh. It...

1407
01:04:55,152 --> 01:04:56,414
It was tough.

1408
01:04:58,459 --> 01:04:59,896
- Come on, it was your first
time cooking.

1409
01:04:59,939 --> 01:05:02,246
- Yeah. So says Ms. Grey Eggs
over here.

1410
01:05:06,206 --> 01:05:08,295
- True, true. Yeah, we should
open a restaurant.

1411
01:05:08,339 --> 01:05:10,907
- Oh yes, we'd be quite
the pair.

1412
01:05:11,777 --> 01:05:14,345
Lines around the block,
I'm sure.

1413
01:05:15,824 --> 01:05:18,392
- It's been quite a week.
- Yes, it has.

1414
01:05:18,436 --> 01:05:21,308
I should thank you for, um...

1415
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:25,138
just reminding me.

1416
01:05:25,182 --> 01:05:26,313
- Of what?

1417
01:05:26,357 --> 01:05:28,098
- Of what apparently
I'd been missing.

1418
01:05:28,141 --> 01:05:32,102
This laughter, music, life.

1419
01:05:32,145 --> 01:05:34,626
I've had an amazing visit.

1420
01:05:34,669 --> 01:05:37,585
- Me too. I, uh...

1421
01:05:37,629 --> 01:05:41,198
I actually wrote something

1422
01:05:41,241 --> 01:05:44,897
for you... just to read
after you've gone home.

1423
01:05:49,467 --> 01:05:51,382
- But maybe I...

1424
01:05:51,425 --> 01:05:55,647
don't want to go home.

1425
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:58,824
- Yeah, I get it.

1426
01:05:58,867 --> 01:06:00,782
It's like when you
read a great book,

1427
01:06:00,826 --> 01:06:02,262
and you don't want it to end.

1428
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:05,396
- That's precisely my point.

1429
01:06:07,746 --> 01:06:09,878
Maybe it doesn't have to end.

1430
01:06:11,663 --> 01:06:13,317
- What do you mean?

1431
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:16,581
- Perhaps with some imagination,

1432
01:06:16,624 --> 01:06:18,800
a way can be found.

1433
01:06:18,844 --> 01:06:20,933
- But I leave tomorrow,

1434
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:22,326
a-and you...

1435
01:06:22,369 --> 01:06:24,371
- Perhaps I could delay
my trip a bit.

1436
01:06:25,285 --> 01:06:26,808
- But your coronation.

1437
01:06:26,852 --> 01:06:29,855
- Honestly, I'm not thinking
about any of that right now.

1438
01:06:30,334 --> 01:06:31,988
- Henry!

1439
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:35,992
Apparently, I've arrived
just in time.

1440
01:06:37,167 --> 01:06:40,648
Henry and I have an urgent
matter to discuss.

1441
01:06:42,389 --> 01:06:46,089
- Father, I can't believe
you actually came all this way.

1442
01:06:46,872 --> 01:06:49,005
- What can I say, Henry?

1443
01:06:49,048 --> 01:06:51,398
It seems you needed my help.

1444
01:06:52,747 --> 01:06:55,141
- I'm not sure that's true.

1445
01:06:55,185 --> 01:06:59,363
- Well, you came here
to sell the Winter Palace.

1446
01:06:59,406 --> 01:07:01,669
Has it been sold?

1447
01:07:03,106 --> 01:07:06,674
- Well no, not yet,
but I just need more time.

1448
01:07:06,718 --> 01:07:08,981
Besides, the coronation
isn't until next week.

1449
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:11,505
- Yes, well,
that's the problem, Henry.

1450
01:07:11,549 --> 01:07:13,681
There is no more time.

1451
01:07:13,725 --> 01:07:15,074
- Ah.

1452
01:07:17,816 --> 01:07:20,036
Look, Father...

1453
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,346
I've been thinking.

1454
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:30,611
Edwina has done
astonishing work in my absence.

1455
01:07:30,655 --> 01:07:32,526
So I've been told.

1456
01:07:32,570 --> 01:07:35,486
And if you'll remember,
the treaty was her idea.

1457
01:07:35,529 --> 01:07:39,794
She speaks multiple languages,
she spearheads charities,

1458
01:07:39,838 --> 01:07:41,666
I think she actually wants--

1459
01:07:41,709 --> 01:07:44,886
- Henry, that is not
for you to decide.

1460
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:54,766
It's an honor to serve.

1461
01:07:54,809 --> 01:07:56,637
- Yes.

1462
01:07:56,681 --> 01:07:58,857
- And I won't hear anything more
to the contrary.

1463
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:01,120
- Father, you wanted
an ordinary life, didn't you?

1464
01:08:01,164 --> 01:08:02,295
Before you became king.

1465
01:08:02,339 --> 01:08:04,123
- Yes, but when Chauncey
stepped down,

1466
01:08:04,167 --> 01:08:05,690
there was no other
choice for me.

1467
01:08:05,733 --> 01:08:08,127
- But don't you ever regret
not taking that life?

1468
01:08:08,171 --> 01:08:11,261
- Your mother and I did
what we had to for the nation.

1469
01:08:11,304 --> 01:08:13,132
As must you too.

1470
01:08:13,176 --> 01:08:15,352
Concordia must have
its new ruler,

1471
01:08:15,395 --> 01:08:16,744
as soon as possible.

1472
01:08:16,788 --> 01:08:18,790
- And what, you're worried
that I might run away?

1473
01:08:18,833 --> 01:08:22,054
- Yes, well...
Once was enough with Chauncey.

1474
01:08:25,362 --> 01:08:26,928
- The chancellor
and Lord Chamberlain

1475
01:08:26,972 --> 01:08:28,234
will be arriving here tomorrow.

1476
01:08:28,278 --> 01:08:29,670
- What? Why would they
come here?

1477
01:08:29,714 --> 01:08:31,542
- Because the coronation
will take place here.

1478
01:08:31,585 --> 01:08:32,804
The day after tomorrow.

1479
01:08:32,847 --> 01:08:34,153
In the chapel.

1480
01:08:34,197 --> 01:08:36,677
- What?! Why?

1481
01:08:37,417 --> 01:08:39,724
- Rumors back home, Henry.

1482
01:08:39,767 --> 01:08:43,293
Rumors that you're getting
cold feet.

1483
01:08:43,336 --> 01:08:46,470
Concordia must have its monarch.

1484
01:08:46,513 --> 01:08:48,428
The prime minister wants
the coronation done now,

1485
01:08:48,472 --> 01:08:50,604
and honestly, Henry,

1486
01:08:50,648 --> 01:08:52,171
I agree.

1487
01:08:52,215 --> 01:08:54,391
- But it can't happen here.

1488
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:58,438
The coronation must happen
on Concordian soil.

1489
01:08:58,482 --> 01:09:00,962
- Well, since embassies
are considered the territory

1490
01:09:01,006 --> 01:09:02,660
of the nation they represent,

1491
01:09:02,703 --> 01:09:06,229
you are going to temporarily
transfer the chalet's deed

1492
01:09:06,272 --> 01:09:09,188
to our embassy here.

1493
01:09:09,232 --> 01:09:12,235
And then, after the coronation,

1494
01:09:12,278 --> 01:09:15,238
they will sell this place
at long last.

1495
01:09:23,463 --> 01:09:25,161
- You two kissed?
- I mean, no.

1496
01:09:25,204 --> 01:09:27,554
Not, like, technically no.
But almost!

1497
01:09:27,598 --> 01:09:29,687
And Becca, I don't know
what to do.

1498
01:09:29,730 --> 01:09:31,036
I mean, my week's almost up,

1499
01:09:31,079 --> 01:09:32,646
and my book needs
all of my attention.

1500
01:09:32,690 --> 01:09:35,823
And Henry's about to become
the king of a country in Europe

1501
01:09:35,867 --> 01:09:37,738
in a few days!
I mean, this is ridiculous!

1502
01:09:37,782 --> 01:09:40,132
It should never
have gotten this far.

1503
01:09:41,612 --> 01:09:43,353
But...

1504
01:09:43,396 --> 01:09:46,094
I am falling for him, Becca.

1505
01:09:46,921 --> 01:09:49,010
I think I'm in love.
- Emily...

1506
01:09:49,054 --> 01:09:52,623
Slow down. There's something
you should know.

1507
01:09:52,666 --> 01:09:55,408
I saw a story online
from some tabloid.

1508
01:09:55,452 --> 01:09:57,758
It's got a photo
of you in it together.

1509
01:09:57,802 --> 01:10:00,239
- Oh. What does it say?

1510
01:10:00,283 --> 01:10:03,286
- "Snow prince melts hearts,
while back home,

1511
01:10:03,329 --> 01:10:06,158
Princess Beatrix is stewing
amid rumors

1512
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:09,117
of engagement announcement
soon going out."

1513
01:10:09,161 --> 01:10:11,207
- Engagement? No, no...

1514
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:12,947
Henry said that relationship
was over.

1515
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:14,340
- Are you sure?

1516
01:10:14,384 --> 01:10:16,951
It says here that they're
on again, off again,

1517
01:10:16,995 --> 01:10:18,257
but they're back on,
and the announcement

1518
01:10:18,301 --> 01:10:19,476
is soon coming out.

1519
01:10:19,519 --> 01:10:20,738
- What?

1520
01:10:20,781 --> 01:10:22,827
- Yeah. And there
are more headlines.

1521
01:10:23,567 --> 01:10:26,222
"Is Prince Henry on a date
in the U.S.?"

1522
01:10:26,265 --> 01:10:29,137
"What will fiancée
Princess Beatrix think?"

1523
01:10:29,181 --> 01:10:33,316
"Can Concordia afford a royal
scandal at this critical time?"

1524
01:10:33,359 --> 01:10:35,056
Do you want to hear more?

1525
01:10:35,622 --> 01:10:37,276
- No, it's okay.

1526
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:39,104
I've heard enough.

1527
01:10:44,414 --> 01:10:46,285
- Emily!

1528
01:10:48,374 --> 01:10:49,941
- Uh...
- You're leaving?

1529
01:10:49,984 --> 01:10:52,465
- Yeah, I was just about
to find you to say goodbye.

1530
01:10:52,509 --> 01:10:53,727
- What's the rush?

1531
01:10:53,771 --> 01:10:55,468
- You know, Henry,
I have a book to finish

1532
01:10:55,512 --> 01:10:57,035
and a life in Boulder.

1533
01:10:57,078 --> 01:11:00,343
And you have a life...

1534
01:11:00,386 --> 01:11:01,996
waiting for you.

1535
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:04,738
You have an entire
nation waiting for you.

1536
01:11:04,782 --> 01:11:08,481
And, uh... obligations
that I'm just

1537
01:11:08,525 --> 01:11:10,788
distracting you from.

1538
01:11:10,831 --> 01:11:12,398
Goodbye, Henry.

1539
01:11:15,619 --> 01:11:19,449
- Surely goodbye
doesn't have to be farewell.

1540
01:11:20,493 --> 01:11:21,668
- Please don't make this
any harder

1541
01:11:21,712 --> 01:11:23,191
than it already is.

1542
01:11:36,422 --> 01:11:37,554
- Ms. Miller.

1543
01:11:39,338 --> 01:11:41,558
- Oh, Your Majesty.

1544
01:11:42,210 --> 01:11:46,737
- I just wanted to commend you
for doing the right thing.

1545
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:51,132
You know, I was kept informed
of the, uh...

1546
01:11:51,176 --> 01:11:52,786
well, the shenanigans.

1547
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:56,137
And so, I must confess,
I imagined you to be

1548
01:11:56,181 --> 01:11:57,878
a bit frivolous.

1549
01:11:59,184 --> 01:12:02,318
But you're not at all
as I assumed.

1550
01:12:04,885 --> 01:12:08,106
I guess one mustn't
judge a book by its cover.

1551
01:12:09,934 --> 01:12:11,501
- Thank you.

1552
01:12:13,459 --> 01:12:16,680
I want to apologize
for last night.

1553
01:12:17,942 --> 01:12:21,685
I now know that Henry's going
to be engaged to Beatrix, so...

1554
01:12:22,729 --> 01:12:25,297
Anyway, I should probably go.
I'm sure you have lots of things

1555
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:27,386
to attend to before
you head home to Concordia.

1556
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:29,257
- Ms. Miller.

1557
01:12:29,301 --> 01:12:31,172
You may think me harsh,

1558
01:12:31,216 --> 01:12:33,523
but you must understand

1559
01:12:33,566 --> 01:12:36,439
Concordia must have its king.

1560
01:12:38,005 --> 01:12:40,356
- I just hope
it gets a happy one.

1561
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:49,452
- Couldn't let you leave
without saying goodbye.

1562
01:12:49,495 --> 01:12:52,237
Made this for you.
- Thank you, Fritz!

1563
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:53,456
Origami.
- It's beautiful!

1564
01:12:53,499 --> 01:12:55,196
- Just my little way
of saying thank you.

1565
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:56,937
- Thank me? For what?

1566
01:12:56,981 --> 01:12:59,157
- For starters, introducing me
to my new girlfriend.

1567
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:01,855
That ski instructor I met
on our fun day,

1568
01:13:01,899 --> 01:13:04,075
will come visit me
in Concordia this summer.

1569
01:13:04,118 --> 01:13:06,207
- Fritz, I'm so happy for you!

1570
01:13:06,251 --> 01:13:08,993
I wish you nothing but the best.

1571
01:13:11,735 --> 01:13:13,954
Ms. Tilson.
- Ms. Miller.

1572
01:13:13,998 --> 01:13:16,435
Well, I don't know what to say.

1573
01:13:16,479 --> 01:13:17,871
It's a bit awkward.

1574
01:13:17,915 --> 01:13:20,874
Maybe I'm succumbing
to the altitude.

1575
01:13:20,918 --> 01:13:22,485
- Come here.

1576
01:13:28,316 --> 01:13:30,841
- You really are
a breath of fresh air.

1577
01:13:32,451 --> 01:13:34,061
- Thank you.

1578
01:13:35,889 --> 01:13:37,543
Safe travels home.

1579
01:13:38,152 --> 01:13:39,458
- Goodbye.

1580
01:13:59,130 --> 01:14:01,524
- Welcome home, stranger.
- Thanks.

1581
01:14:02,699 --> 01:14:04,962
- Back one day, and already
looking busy.

1582
01:14:05,005 --> 01:14:08,008
- I was busy,
up until just a moment ago.

1583
01:14:10,228 --> 01:14:12,273
And... send.

1584
01:14:12,317 --> 01:14:14,406
- Did you just do
what I think you did?

1585
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:15,407
- Yes!

1586
01:14:16,364 --> 01:14:19,019
I just sent my entire
manuscript to the publisher.

1587
01:14:19,063 --> 01:14:22,283
I-I can't believe it, I'm done!
I'm done!

1588
01:14:22,327 --> 01:14:24,808
- I knew you could do it.
- Oh!

1589
01:14:25,678 --> 01:14:27,941
- So, what's next?

1590
01:14:29,943 --> 01:14:31,771
- Good question.

1591
01:14:32,337 --> 01:14:35,688
- Emily, I'm sorry
that I roped you into all this.

1592
01:14:35,732 --> 01:14:37,342
- No, I...

1593
01:14:37,385 --> 01:14:40,519
No, I should thank you,
actually.

1594
01:14:40,563 --> 01:14:41,825
- Really?

1595
01:14:42,695 --> 01:14:47,134
- It was the most beautiful,
inspiring adventure.

1596
01:14:48,658 --> 01:14:50,573
And I wouldn't have
missed it for the world.

1597
01:14:56,927 --> 01:14:58,450
- Thank you.

1598
01:14:59,059 --> 01:15:00,539
- Come now, sire.

1599
01:15:00,583 --> 01:15:02,280
Why so glum?

1600
01:15:02,323 --> 01:15:04,891
This is a great day
of celebration for our country.

1601
01:15:04,935 --> 01:15:06,719
- Of course, it will be.

1602
01:15:06,763 --> 01:15:08,852
- These, sire?
- No, the black, please.

1603
01:15:08,895 --> 01:15:10,462
With the patent leathers.
- Yes, sire.

1604
01:15:12,377 --> 01:15:14,553
- Oh, you're looking
every bit a king, Henry.

1605
01:15:14,597 --> 01:15:16,642
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Now, if only we could

1606
01:15:16,686 --> 01:15:18,470
get him to smile.

1607
01:15:22,039 --> 01:15:23,344
- So?

1608
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:26,478
Are you ready?

1609
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:28,698
- Yes, as I'll ever be.

1610
01:15:32,092 --> 01:15:34,573
- I, uh, thought after
the coronation,

1611
01:15:34,617 --> 01:15:37,707
it might be wise
to announce the new treaty.

1612
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:40,318
A bright start to your reign.

1613
01:15:40,361 --> 01:15:42,581
- Hmm? Oh...

1614
01:15:42,625 --> 01:15:44,627
Oh yes, the treaty.

1615
01:15:44,670 --> 01:15:46,933
That's a good idea.
Let's do that.

1616
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:50,415
- Your mind seems elsewhere,
Henry.

1617
01:15:51,372 --> 01:15:53,200
Is something the matter?

1618
01:15:53,244 --> 01:15:56,116
- No. Everything's well, Father.

1619
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:59,293
- Henry, for what it's worth,

1620
01:15:59,337 --> 01:16:01,165
I liked her too.

1621
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:05,822
I chatted with Ms. Miller
before she left.

1622
01:16:05,865 --> 01:16:09,782
She's very smart.
A delightful young woman.

1623
01:16:10,522 --> 01:16:12,176
- Yes.

1624
01:16:13,873 --> 01:16:15,701
But, uh...

1625
01:16:17,137 --> 01:16:19,575
In the end...

1626
01:16:21,272 --> 01:16:22,839
...what I thought we had
was a fiction.

1627
01:16:23,970 --> 01:16:25,581
- I see.

1628
01:16:27,365 --> 01:16:29,889
- I should really keep
working on my speech.

1629
01:16:30,498 --> 01:16:32,762
- Yes. Of course.

1630
01:16:35,939 --> 01:16:37,549
What's that?

1631
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:41,335
- It's something Emily gave me.

1632
01:16:42,075 --> 01:16:44,643
- Listen, Henry.

1633
01:16:45,426 --> 01:16:47,777
I failed to clear up
a misunderstanding

1634
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:51,737
that Ms. Miller had
regarding your...

1635
01:16:51,781 --> 01:16:53,521
engagement with Beatrix.

1636
01:16:55,959 --> 01:16:58,701
I wasn't sure what to say.

1637
01:16:58,744 --> 01:17:01,486
And so, I didn't say anything.

1638
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:05,664
- Oh. Well...

1639
01:17:09,668 --> 01:17:11,409
It's alright.

1640
01:17:13,237 --> 01:17:16,719
- Well, I should...
I should go.

1641
01:17:16,762 --> 01:17:18,677
And...

1642
01:17:19,547 --> 01:17:20,766
leave you to it.

1643
01:17:26,685 --> 01:17:29,166
- "A note for a king."

1644
01:17:37,783 --> 01:17:41,308
"Every block of stone
has a statue in it.

1645
01:17:41,352 --> 01:17:44,747
And it is the task of
the sculptor to discover it.

1646
01:17:46,139 --> 01:17:48,489
Never doubt your courage.

1647
01:17:50,056 --> 01:17:52,232
P.S.

1648
01:17:52,276 --> 01:17:54,713
That's a royal order."

1649
01:17:55,845 --> 01:17:58,891
- Brother. The coronation
begins in four hours.

1650
01:18:00,371 --> 01:18:02,112
Are you quite alright?

1651
01:18:11,077 --> 01:18:13,427
- You know what? Now that
I've got this book on the way,

1652
01:18:13,471 --> 01:18:15,168
I think I want to just
jump into the next one.

1653
01:18:15,212 --> 01:18:18,084
- Yeah?
- Yeah. You know, I'm on a roll.

1654
01:18:18,128 --> 01:18:19,738
- Any idea what that might be?

1655
01:18:19,782 --> 01:18:21,609
- Uh...

1656
01:18:22,523 --> 01:18:24,656
I actually started
outlining a few stories.

1657
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:25,918
But I...

1658
01:18:26,832 --> 01:18:29,748
I left my new idea book
up at the chalet.

1659
01:18:29,792 --> 01:18:31,750
- Well, you need to go get it.

1660
01:18:31,794 --> 01:18:33,665
- I know. I know, I just...

1661
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:35,841
I-I don't want to go up there
if Henry's still there,

1662
01:18:35,885 --> 01:18:37,887
and I don't know exactly
when they're leaving.

1663
01:18:37,930 --> 01:18:39,889
Do you know?
- They must've left,

1664
01:18:39,932 --> 01:18:42,108
because I saw a news alert today
that said

1665
01:18:42,152 --> 01:18:43,806
the coronation's happening
today.

1666
01:18:44,502 --> 01:18:46,417
So, if they're in Concordia,

1667
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:47,897
the chalet must be empty
right now.

1668
01:18:47,940 --> 01:18:49,333
- Okay.

1669
01:18:49,376 --> 01:18:51,204
- Are you gonna go?

1670
01:18:51,683 --> 01:18:53,250
Do you want me to go with you?

1671
01:18:53,293 --> 01:18:55,643
- You know, you have to get
back to work in a few minutes,

1672
01:18:55,687 --> 01:18:57,210
and I think I just
want to go now,

1673
01:18:57,254 --> 01:18:58,646
and just get on with it.

1674
01:18:58,690 --> 01:19:01,824
Besides, it'll be night
before I get there.

1675
01:19:42,865 --> 01:19:46,564
As I step down,
I turn to you,

1676
01:19:47,478 --> 01:19:50,002
my eldest child, Prince Henry,

1677
01:19:50,046 --> 01:19:52,570
to ask if you will
assume the throne

1678
01:19:52,613 --> 01:19:55,181
as defender of the realm,

1679
01:19:55,225 --> 01:19:57,270
King of Concordia.

1680
01:19:58,054 --> 01:20:00,317
Carrying out your duties

1681
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:02,319
with all your heart.

1682
01:20:04,277 --> 01:20:05,496
Please.

1683
01:20:05,539 --> 01:20:07,628
Make your proclamation.

1684
01:20:13,896 --> 01:20:16,855
Our most
hallowed tradition

1685
01:20:16,899 --> 01:20:19,640
is the passing
of the Concordian crown

1686
01:20:19,684 --> 01:20:21,686
from one monarch to the next.

1687
01:20:23,557 --> 01:20:26,996
And while it is tempting
for us to grieve

1688
01:20:27,039 --> 01:20:29,259
as one chapter ends...

1689
01:20:31,087 --> 01:20:34,046
we must also celebrate
as another begins.

1690
01:20:36,222 --> 01:20:40,226
To rule Concordia requires
a full and honest heart.

1691
01:20:42,533 --> 01:20:45,101
The truth is...

1692
01:20:46,885 --> 01:20:50,193
The truth is, my heart
belongs somewhere else.

1693
01:20:50,236 --> 01:20:53,283
And because I cannot give
Concordia my full heart,

1694
01:20:53,326 --> 01:20:56,677
I cannot be your king.

1695
01:20:58,766 --> 01:21:00,899
Someone who is very dear to me

1696
01:21:00,943 --> 01:21:04,860
reminded me of something
that I had learned long ago.

1697
01:21:05,817 --> 01:21:10,126
Every stone has a statue in it.

1698
01:21:10,169 --> 01:21:13,825
Just... waiting to be
discovered.

1699
01:21:15,261 --> 01:21:17,263
Life is this way.

1700
01:21:18,743 --> 01:21:20,614
We cannot see our futures

1701
01:21:20,658 --> 01:21:24,923
any more than we can see
a statue trapped in stone.

1702
01:21:24,967 --> 01:21:27,665
And yet, chip by chip,

1703
01:21:27,708 --> 01:21:30,102
our lives begin
to reveal themselves

1704
01:21:30,146 --> 01:21:33,584
until they are released
from their blocks.

1705
01:21:33,627 --> 01:21:35,673
Thus...

1706
01:21:35,716 --> 01:21:37,588
we are faced with a choice

1707
01:21:38,676 --> 01:21:40,939
to carve out a life worth living

1708
01:21:40,983 --> 01:21:43,811
or to be carved out
by life itself.

1709
01:21:44,508 --> 01:21:48,338
Now, the choice before me today
is to continue down a path

1710
01:21:48,381 --> 01:21:50,862
that I know in my heart
is wrong.

1711
01:21:53,734 --> 01:21:57,347
The Princess Edwina
is far more capable

1712
01:21:57,390 --> 01:21:59,349
and more passionate,

1713
01:21:59,392 --> 01:22:01,438
and better suited
to rule Concordia

1714
01:22:01,481 --> 01:22:03,831
than I could ever hope to be.

1715
01:22:05,398 --> 01:22:07,183
That is, if she's interested.

1716
01:22:09,533 --> 01:22:11,709
- I thought you'd never ask.

1717
01:22:16,714 --> 01:22:19,238
- My son is quite right.

1718
01:22:20,022 --> 01:22:23,112
Concordia must have its monarch.

1719
01:22:24,374 --> 01:22:26,463
And so it shall.

1720
01:22:26,506 --> 01:22:28,813
Not a king,

1721
01:22:28,856 --> 01:22:31,294
but a queen.

1722
01:22:35,907 --> 01:22:38,954
Long live the queen!

1723
01:22:39,519 --> 01:22:41,782
Long live the queen!

1724
01:22:43,567 --> 01:22:45,221
Sorry to put you
on the spot, Eddie,

1725
01:22:45,264 --> 01:22:46,526
but I knew you could handle it.

1726
01:22:46,570 --> 01:22:47,875
- Are you joking?

1727
01:22:47,919 --> 01:22:49,921
This is the most fun
I've had all year!

1728
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:52,402
- Perhaps not a typical
coronation,

1729
01:22:52,445 --> 01:22:54,491
but...

1730
01:22:54,534 --> 01:22:56,580
I believe the right one.

1731
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:04,501
- Emily.

1732
01:23:08,070 --> 01:23:11,377
Go to her.
That is a royal order!

1733
01:23:14,598 --> 01:23:16,556
- I know why you left.

1734
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:19,472
But Beatrix and I broke up,
but the palace kept the breakup

1735
01:23:19,516 --> 01:23:21,213
quiet because we felt that
a public breakup

1736
01:23:21,257 --> 01:23:22,649
might erode support
for the treaty between

1737
01:23:22,693 --> 01:23:24,782
our two nations, but anyway,
none of that matters,

1738
01:23:24,825 --> 01:23:26,392
because I'm not
going to be king,

1739
01:23:26,436 --> 01:23:28,351
and Edwina's going to sign
the treaty tomo--

1740
01:23:28,394 --> 01:23:29,787
Why are you hiding
behind a flag?

1741
01:23:29,830 --> 01:23:33,051
- Oh, um... I-I...

1742
01:23:33,095 --> 01:23:36,141
I came back to get
the book you gave me.

1743
01:23:36,185 --> 01:23:37,360
Uh...

1744
01:23:37,403 --> 01:23:39,144
The coronation?

1745
01:23:39,188 --> 01:23:40,711
- Yeah.
- W-What...

1746
01:23:40,754 --> 01:23:42,626
What does it mean?

1747
01:23:42,669 --> 01:23:44,454
Are you staying?

1748
01:23:44,497 --> 01:23:46,325
- Only if you stay.

1749
01:23:47,718 --> 01:23:50,460
You and this place
are all I've ever wanted.

1750
01:23:50,503 --> 01:23:53,811
- What about your royal destiny?

1751
01:23:57,119 --> 01:23:59,251
- I wanted to write
my own story.

1752
01:24:00,470 --> 01:24:02,863
One where the couple
ended up together.

1753
01:24:05,301 --> 01:24:07,042
- I guess Shakespeare was right.

1754
01:24:08,391 --> 01:24:10,958
Journeys do end
in lovers meeting.

1755
01:24:27,149 --> 01:24:28,759
