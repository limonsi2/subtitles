(man softly grunting)
(car seat softly rubbing)

6
00:00:32,156 --> 00:00:32,991
- No.

7
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:35,618
Douglas-

8
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:37,245
- I'm trying, I'm,

9
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:39,914
I'm trying...

10
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,335
I don't want you to think
this is about you at all.

11
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:45,628
Has nothing to do about you.

12
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:47,422
Don't think about it's
about you for a second.

13
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:48,298
It's not about you.

14
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,468
- It's kinda hard not to when...

15
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,473
- What can I do about it?

16
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:59,184
- I don't know, maybe that's
one you can figure out.

17
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:02,812
(soft haunting piano music)

18
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,376
- You open up,
I'll grab the bags.

19
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,211
- That's way too much.

20
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,419
- I got it.

21
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:10,588
- Just give me the
chips at least, come on.

22
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,090
- You can have the chips,

23
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,049
or just take your purse or I'm
not gonna carry it anymore.

24
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:13,883
- Okay.

25
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:26,521
(soft haunting piano music)

26
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,714
- Hey, Vee, where's my suitcase?

27
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,382
- [Veronica] I brought
it downstairs, babe.

28
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:55,925
I had to get ready.

29
00:02:58,428 --> 00:02:59,262
- Okay.

30
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,432
- [Veronica] Dan's
gonna be here soon,

31
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,600
I wanted to get changed.

32
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,061
- Okay.

33
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:13,443
- [Veronica] You want
me to bring it up?

34
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,777
- No, I'm good, thank you.

35
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:22,410
(soft piano music)

36
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,654
Yay.
- Hi

37
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,116
- So Donna found
that photo of us.

38
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:04,452
I thought we lost it.

39
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:05,703
- Which one?

40
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,330
- The one from the
trip before last.

41
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,962
I was, I thought it was gone.

42
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,713
Just found it behind the futon.

43
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:16,547
- Oh.

44
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,885
- If I was gonna
lift, was gonna lift

45
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:23,012
and I'm gonna finish
that script on this trip,

46
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,013
I can just feel it.

47
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:26,683
- Hope so.

48
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,186
- Is it too late just to,

49
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:33,064
just to have Dan go
back to Orange County?

50
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,565
- You wanted him to come.

51
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,025
- I didn't say yes.

52
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,027
- Yeah, you didn't
say no either.

53
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:40,154
And no decision is a decision.

54
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,406
You don't want Pia
and Dan to come up,

55
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,365
then you should said something.

56
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,366
- I said nothing about Pia.

57
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,203
- Oh, let me get that for you.

58
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,207
- That came off too adamant.

59
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,376
You're the only girl
for me, you know that.

60
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:55,336
- Yeah, sure.

61
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,882
(car softly honks)

62
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,553
- Veronica!

63
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,554
Pia, ready?
- Are we doing this again?

64
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,222
- Veronica!
- Veronica!

65
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,724
- [Veronica] Veronica!

66
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,392
- Veronica!

67
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:12,270
(soft piano music)

68
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,240
Stop the press, hello.

69
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,243
Jessica Rabbit, hey.

70
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:30,955
Oh my god, you are a dream.
(Veronica softly laughs)

71
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:31,789
Look at you.
- Hello, Douglas.

72
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,249
- Smell nice.

73
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,082
- Pia.

74
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:35,960
- Hi!
- Hey!

75
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,255
Hey.
- Hi, sweetie, how are you?

76
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,214
- [Pia] Good, you?

77
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:47,096
- Come here, you douchebag,
come here, missed you.

78
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,890
Hey, babe, babe,
what I tell you?

79
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,391
Bitch-in-love hug.

80
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,101
Whoa, whoa, I'm kidding.

81
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:56,105
So what are you doing,
you gonna invite us in?

82
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,607
This guy all of a
sudden gets a hot wife

83
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:58,900
and he's got no manners.

84
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,109
- Was gonna help
you with the bag.

85
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,153
- She's fine, look at
her, she's hot, look.

86
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,280
This is for you.

87
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,281
We know you don't
know shit about wine.

88
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,491
- Dan.

89
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,618
- He doesn't, so we
picked this out for you.

90
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,663
- Who says I don't
know shit about wine?

91
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:13,956
I know this wine.

92
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,124
- "Who says I don't
know shit about,"

93
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,584
no one has to say it, Dougie.

94
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:20,296
This guy, you so cute, come
on, show me the house, come on!

95
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:23,341
(cicadas softly buzzing)

96
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,634
- Stop.

97
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,803
- You can look, we know
you need to watch this.

98
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,679
See what's happening here.

99
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,306
Give him the neck.

100
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,308
(softly kissing)
- Hey, baby, we can-

101
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,102
- Okay, okay, you're awesome.

102
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,771
To you, this has been amazing.

103
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:37,980
- Yeah.

104
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,982
- Dougie, you've found
a great one, cheers.

105
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,195
- You're beautifully
dressed, as always.

106
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:47,365
- She is, well, I just
got one question though.

107
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:49,826
Doug, when are you
gonna do something

108
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,494
about that shit
around your mouth?

109
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,495
- [Pia] Dan.

110
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,497
- What, babe, what?

111
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,207
It's getting out of hand,
you said so in the car.

112
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,501
- [Pia] No, I didn't.

113
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,629
- Well, I happen to like it.

114
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,672
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

115
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:03,965
- Doesn't bother you trying to

116
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,384
find his lips through
all that shit?

117
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,177
- Nah, she likes the bush.

118
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,178
- She does?

119
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,680
- Yeah.

120
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,848
- Everyone likes a little
bush nowadays, right?

121
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,182
- It's like a
picnic, you have to

122
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:14,851
go through some
bush to get there.

123
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,185
- He should shave the bush-

124
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,687
- No, bad boy.
- It's better to go through.

125
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:18,855
What's goin' on?

126
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,690
Everyone likes a
little bush, huh, babe?

127
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,066
- Stop it.
- Actually, there's nothing,

128
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,192
she's clean as a.

129
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,529
I love you.

130
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,823
Hey, Dougie, you remember
the Wasserman account

131
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,199
You remember that-
- Boo!

132
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,993
What, what, what?
- Yeah, no, we said no.

133
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,077
We said no-
- Oh, come on, no.

134
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,078
- No.
- Are you serious?

135
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,413
- We had one rule.

136
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,706
- What's the rule?

137
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:37,665
- [Douglas] You're
such a dick, dude.

138
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,207
- You tell me what the rule was.

139
00:07:39,207 --> 00:07:40,877
No talking shop.

140
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,213
- Are you serious about this?
- Or just no talking, period.

141
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,673
- No talking?

142
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,009
Geez, listen, Dougie, are
you sure you wanna hear this?

143
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,218
- You're a dick.

144
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,720
- Am I gonna tell
the story or not?

145
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,846
- Carry on.
- Yes!

146
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,598
Okay, this one Wasserman
account, right?

147
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,057
I've been trying to
land this account

148
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:57,058
for I don't know how long,
it was Dougie's lead,

149
00:07:57,058 --> 00:08:01,898
he couldn't land it, easy
150 grand a month, easy.

150
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,399
Dougie couldn't land it because

151
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,776
of Tim fucking McNealy, that
prick, remember that guy?

152
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:08,946
- He worked at a different
copier place and he's a dick.

153
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:11,407
- Yeah, well, yeah, but I
thought I was telling the story.

154
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,617
Veer, I'm telling
the story, right?

155
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,951
- Yes, go, go on.
- Baby, babe,

156
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,077
can I finish the story?
- You have the floor.

157
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,245
- Oh my gosh, keep going.

158
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:19,123
- Thank you, so,
right, after you left,

159
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,626
Rob passed it around people's
desks, didn't happen.

160
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:25,087
Landed on my desk, like
a turd, what do I do?

161
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,130
What do I do, babe?

162
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,591
- I know the story, keep going.

163
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:29,926
- Yeah, I go pay
Wasserman a visit, right,

164
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,260
every time I get there,

165
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,261
the jerk-off gatekeeper
says he's got no time.

166
00:08:33,261 --> 00:08:34,804
Every time, no time.

167
00:08:34,804 --> 00:08:38,601
So I wait a couple weeks, and
then, I do the unthinkable.

168
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,102
Can I get a drum roll, please?

169
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,438
I pull out the clipboard.

170
00:08:43,438 --> 00:08:45,775
- [Veronica] What's
with the clipboard?

171
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,319
- Dougie, you wanna tell
'em or should I tell 'em?

172
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,612
(Douglas softly mumbling)
Should I tell 'em?

173
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,781
Let me tell 'em, let
me tell, okay, okay.

174
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,449
One day, Doug's in some office,

175
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,992
some schmuck's office,
I don't know who.

176
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:57,620
These people, maintenance
people, walking through,

177
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,415
holding a clipboard,
nobody says nothing, nada.

178
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,334
They just let 'em walk right by.

179
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:06,003
Dougie here gets the smart idea,

180
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:09,131
he goes into Office Depot,
Office Depot, or was it...

181
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,633
- Office Max.

182
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,510
- Office Max, nobody stops
the guy with the clipboard,

183
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,970
or a Mexican with
the leaf blower.

184
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,972
- Oh, what?
- I can say that joke,

185
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,808
because, listen, I can say
that joke, I'm half Mexican.

186
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,309
You guys can't, you
will be canceled,

187
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,853
I'm just stating facts.

188
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,814
- What about a white
guy with a leaf blower?

189
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,525
- Yes, this also works.

190
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:31,112
Anyways, I got the clipboard,
I go right past that jerk-off.

191
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,321
I'm in Wasserman's office

192
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,031
and he walks in five
minutes later, right?

193
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,157
- No way.
- Way.

194
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:37,034
And we're doing the damn thing,

195
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,787
three yeses, I'm in,
this guy won't commit.

196
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,831
Whatever I do, he
will not commit.

197
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,665
Had to give him
everything, everything.

198
00:09:43,665 --> 00:09:45,668
Almost had to let
Pia fuck him here.

199
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,503
I was thinking I had to do it,

200
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,630
and I almost thought I
was gonna do it, but,

201
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,506
I kid, I kid, baby.

202
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:51,674
- Aw!
- Yeah.

203
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:52,883
- I would never let
him do that, well-

204
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:53,676
- It's okay, maybe
I wanna do it.

205
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,845
- Whoa, pause, babe.

206
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,681
(soft ominous music building)

207
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,516
Dougie knows though,
I don't lose.

208
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,853
Dan Mackie never loses, never.

209
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,026
So, I get this bright idea,

210
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,528
my bulb goes off, I head
down to the corner store,

211
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:13,738
I grab a deck of cards.

212
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,197
Next meeting, I walk
in with five cards,

213
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,867
Ace, King, Queen,
Jack, 10, all hearts.

214
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,201
You know what that is,
tell 'em what it is.

215
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,369
- I don't know.

216
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:21,203
- You know, it's a
royal flush, say royal-

217
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,663
- A flush.

218
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:26,208
- It's a royal flush, whatever,
she's foreign, it's cool.

219
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:29,211
You can call on any of my guys,

220
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:32,173
anytime with this hand,
now make it happen.

221
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:36,344
But each time he calls, I take

222
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,094
one card,

223
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:42,391
and when I finally
have five cards,

224
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:45,519
I get to go all in and ask him

225
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,731
for one favor and
he's gotta do it.

226
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,899
We shook on it.

227
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,067
It was a deal,
Dougie, you remember.

228
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:55,112
So, (softly chuckling)

229
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:57,281
he used his last
card on Wednesday.

230
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,617
Me, I asked for my
favor yesterday.

231
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:01,744
I asked for his business.

232
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,080
And this morning,

233
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,207
well, this morning,

234
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,709
I closed that motherfucker!

235
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,252
(Pia speaking French)
Fuck you,

236
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,253
Timmy Fucking McNealy

237
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:12,421
and that's how you do it.

238
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,255
Can I get an amen?
(Pia speaking French)

239
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,256
Can I get an amen, amen?

240
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,633
- [Veronica] Amen.

241
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:16,759
(Pia speaks French)

242
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,427
- I'm sorry, right?

243
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,762
Come on, that's a power move.

244
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,806
Was that a Kanye move?

245
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,432
I'm like Kanye.

246
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,060
- That's, congratulations,
that's huge.

247
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,313
- Yeah?

248
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:30,940
You sound so enthused.

249
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,442
- I, no, I don't mean,
I mean, congrats.

250
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,820
- Congrats, that's huge?

251
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,615
Tell me you miss it, Dougie.

252
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:40,950
You miss it, right?

253
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,827
You, don't flip me
off, you miss it.

254
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:46,247
The rush you get, the
feeling of watching

255
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,748
you eat another
cocksucker's lunch, right?

256
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:48,999
- I don't want any
cocksuckers around.

257
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,292
- I don't know, maybe this

258
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:54,088
writing thing fills
that need, I don't know.

259
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:58,134
- If I have a need to
be filled, it does.

260
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,803
- So is that a yes?

261
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:04,265
I don't know, man.

262
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,102
Baby, are you seeing this?

263
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,146
Who does he look like?

264
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:10,980
- [Pia] Stop it.

265
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,691
- You know else had that look?

266
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,776
Gary did.

267
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:20,489
Yeah, it's that look,
man, it's that hunger.

268
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:21,991
If you don't do
something about it,

269
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,492
it's gonna eat
you alive, Dougie.

270
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:24,994
- Dan.

271
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,163
- What, I'm just, look, all
I'm saying is Doug and me,

272
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:29,707
we're like vampires.

273
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,002
Eat another man's lunch,

274
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,172
it's like blood to us.

275
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,341
- Dan.

276
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,676
- All right, all right,
all right, all right.

277
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:41,510
All right, just,

278
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,555
I'm done.

279
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:49,185
Anyways, I need another
drink because I am thirsty.

280
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,857
But seriously though,
can you get me a drink?

281
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:55,858
Something stiff?

282
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,026
- Okay-
I got it,

283
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,527
I got it.
- Was it too much?

284
00:12:58,527 --> 00:12:59,737
- Okay.

285
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,238
- I'm gonna get the
vampire's blood.

286
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,491
- [Dan] Sorry about that.

287
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,700
- That was stupid.

288
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:10,206
- So, how's America's
favorite tart with a heart?

289
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,211
- You know I hate
when you call me that.

290
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,378
- What do you care for?

291
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,213
- Dan.

292
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,007
She doesn't like that.

293
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,717
- Okay, all right, all
right, I'm sorry, but okay,

294
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:24,553
you gotta admit my
favorite character,

295
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:27,556
Kendall James, is a steel-jawed
cunt, let me finish,

296
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:31,227
hiding behind that so gorgeous

297
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,188
and immaculate,
wonderfully deceptive

298
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,900
pretty case of whoever he was.

299
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,236
Isn't it fun being
someone else for a living?

300
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,030
- No, it was.

301
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,407
Yeah.

302
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:46,575
No, it, it was.

303
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,579
I stepped down a few months ago.

304
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,747
- Stepped down?

305
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,457
Qu'est-ce que
c'est stepped down?

306
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,290
You mean,

307
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,085
you quit?

308
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,422
- [Veronica] Yes.

309
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,633
- Oh, Dougie. (softly chuckling)

310
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,427
Your meal ticket here
just got punched, brother.

311
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,721
Looks like you need
to get a real job.

312
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:11,100
Can always come back with
me, or copier sales, huh?

313
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,602
- Why did you step down?

314
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:16,438
- 15 years on the show
started to get stale.

315
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:22,278
- She's all out of love,
and so lost without you.

316
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,281
- Besides, Douglas and
I are looking forward

317
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:28,117
to a normal life,
normal schedule,

318
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,412
spending more time together.

319
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,622
And Douglas has been
working on his writing.

320
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,001
- You hear that, Dougie?

321
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,420
You, you want a normal life?

322
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,463
- I have a normal life.

323
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,966
- That's not what I
asked you, playboy.

324
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:47,845
I said do you,
(ominous music building)

325
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,805
you want a normal life?

326
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:55,269
- I have a normal life, I
like it very much, thank you.

327
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,648
- That's cute.

328
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,150
Who the hell wants
a normal life?

329
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:04,653
- Normal people?

330
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:07,990
- (softly chuckling) Okay.

331
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,868
Okay, now I get it, I get it.

332
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,661
Yeah, I tried being normal once.

333
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:14,997
It was the worst 30
seconds of my fucking life.

334
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:20,002
Normal is for people
without courage.

335
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,505
- I don't know, Dan.

336
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,009
My dad used to say,

337
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:31,513
"You become the price you
paid to get what you want."

338
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:35,351
So, just make sure
you really want it.

339
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:39,563
No matter what it is, even
if it's a normal life.

340
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:44,860
- From the mouth of a babe.

341
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,905
- I don't think
that's an expression.

342
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:48,739
- Well, I'm saying-

343
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:49,698
- For Dan, it is.

344
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:55,996
(ominous music softly building)

345
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,670
- Oh my god.

346
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,504
- See?

347
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:09,343
- Was it me, or was it 1000
times more obnoxious than usual?

348
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,719
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

349
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,056
You weren't like that, right?

350
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,060
- I suppose we all were.

351
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,354
Even when we weren't, you know?

352
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:22,773
- Yeah.

353
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:25,901
I'm sorry.

354
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,404
I know you guys
hadn't seen each other

355
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,905
since the funeral
and everything,

356
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:34,451
and I thought it might help
with your writer's block.

357
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,205
- Maybe it would, you know?

358
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,418
If I hit it to so much
Dan, it might, you know?

359
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,546
It's just so much
Dan, but, it might.

360
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,380
- Yeah.

361
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,133
- No.

362
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,801
- You're so much
better than him.

363
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:57,391
I love you.
(soft piano music)

364
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,267
Just two more days.

365
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,564
- Just two more days.

366
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,619
(soft blues jazz)

367
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:21,290
- Rob has been asking
a lot about you lately.

368
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,084
You know, just figuring
out (softly mumbles)

369
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:26,295
- Thank-
- Hey, let's stop.

370
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,421
Who's selling who
here, all right?

371
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,298
I don't lose, all right?

372
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,591
You're coming back
to work for me.

373
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:33,844
That's it, it's a
done deal, all right?

374
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,138
Winning and shaving, huh?

375
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,306
Go hand in hand.

376
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,641
You do it everyday,
or you look like shit.

377
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,144
That's just, it's just the way.

378
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,104
It's just the way
the world works, man.

379
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:46,482
Gary knew it.

380
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,484
Fucking Gary.

381
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:50,486
Pauline said so.

382
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,322
- You still talk to his wife?

383
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:56,784
- Yeah.

384
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:00,621
Gary.

385
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,333
"How the heaven are you?"

386
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,043
That's what Gary used
to say when he'd walk

387
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,337
into a room, "How
the heaven are you?"

388
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:12,174
Dumb fuckers say hell,
he thought it was corny.

389
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,844
What I wouldn't give to like
hear it again, you know?

390
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,350
(Dan softly humming in sleep)

391
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,185
(dishes loudly clattering)

392
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:26,522
(faucet loudly running)

393
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:33,070
(cookware loudly clanging)

394
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:59,054
(softly uttering gibberish)

395
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:02,391
(softly drumming hands)

396
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:09,064
(loudly drumming hands)

397
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:12,234
(softly drumming hands)

398
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:15,571
(loudly drumming hands)

399
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,749
Hey, hey, hey, hey, wait, wait.

400
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:30,752
Hey, listen, Veronica, Veronica,

401
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,882
she's a good girl, man,
you're lucky you found her.

402
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:36,967
- I am.

403
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,137
- Me too.

404
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,471
- Whatever that means.

405
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,641
- Hey, boop. (softly laughs)

406
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,894
Hey, man, listen, seriously,

407
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,441
you, you're a good friend.

408
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,152
- Yeah, I love you too.

409
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,905
- Hey, you're a good
friend, right, and,

410
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,949
we're brothers, we're brothers.

411
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,786
Sorry about your wife, man.

412
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,997
(dramatic music pounding)

413
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:09,291
(ominous music)

414
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,751
- What'd you say?

415
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,754
Dan, what'd you say, Dan?

416
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,131
Dan! Dan?

417
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:20,135
(ominous music loudly building)

418
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,825
(soft ominous music)

419
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,463
(haunting piano music)

420
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:23,699
(ominous music loudly building)

421
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:46,388
(soft ominous music)

422
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:52,728
(dramatic music loudly pounds)

423
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:57,107
- What you doing?
(ominous music)

424
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,567
Come to bed, baby.

425
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:18,712
(soft haunting piano music)

426
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:20,922
- Vero?

427
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:24,551
Vero?

428
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:27,596
Vero?

429
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:47,949
(dramatic music loudly pounding)

430
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,454
(soft ominous music)

431
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,789
- Did I wake you?

432
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,797
It's been so long since
you've held me like that.

433
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:04,466
I miss it.

434
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:14,309
Are you feeling okay?

435
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,143
- Yeah.

436
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:23,985
- You're not letting what
he said get to you, are you?

437
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:25,445
He's the kinda guy
who shits on you

438
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,989
and says, "Lucky you," 'cause
he's got soap and water.

439
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,492
You're great here.

440
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,495
You're gonna get
the script done.

441
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:36,331
Everything's gonna be fine.

442
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:40,377
- Okay.

443
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,462
Sure.

444
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:43,839
- Just one more day.

445
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,846
Now go take a shower, you
smell like pickled ass.

446
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:56,685
- Thanks.

447
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:02,149
(shower running
drowns out singing)

448
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:07,737
♪ Don't walk away

449
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:10,490
(softly humming)

450
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:16,413
Oh, yeah.

451
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:20,876
Vero?

452
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:23,879
Vero, can you get me a towel?

453
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:33,263
Our shower's acting up again.

454
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:35,098
Vee, can I get a towel?

455
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:41,730
(door loudly clatters)

456
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:45,942
Oh! Sorry.

457
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:48,737
- It's okay, do you
still need a towel?

458
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:52,908
- Yeah, I didn't
know it was you.

459
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,701
- How could you have?

460
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:12,761
Morning.

461
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,262
- Morning.

462
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:15,722
Vero?

463
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,766
Oh, she went to the
general store with Dan

464
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,267
to get some eggs, I think.

465
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,101
- Eggs?

466
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,897
I coulda swore we picked
some eggs on the way up.

467
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,440
- [Pia] Do you want some coffee?

468
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,775
I just made a fresh pot.

469
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:28,610
- Sure.

470
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:33,281
How long did they leave?

471
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,324
- A little while ago.

472
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:38,912
- Here you go.

473
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:39,663
- Thank you.

474
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:54,302
- So, that movie idea,

475
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:56,596
what is it about?

476
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:57,430
- The what?

477
00:25:58,306 --> 00:25:59,349
Oh, the script, yeah.

478
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:02,769
To make a long story less long,

479
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:06,314
it's about a robbery and a love
story that comes out of it.

480
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,025
- Between two of the hostages?

481
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:12,195
- No, no, no, no, between the
robber and one of the hostages

482
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:14,114
but I guess you can kind of
say that he's a hostage too

483
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:17,993
because the robber's
holding them at gunpoint,

484
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:21,496
and the cops are holding the
robber at gunpoint, so, yeah.

485
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,499
Anyway, it just got
a bit too contrived.

486
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:25,333
- [Pia] What?

487
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:26,334
- The script.

488
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,545
- No, what part got contrived?

489
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:33,008
- Oh, the love story,
I guess, and the,

490
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,342
the whole thing, really.

491
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,386
But mainly the love story.

492
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:43,184
Every time I tried it,
I just had to like-

493
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:44,144
- Force it.

494
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,520
- Yeah, yeah.

495
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,355
- Well, you know what they say,

496
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:49,357
love is like fart.

497
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:51,526
If you have to force
it, it's probably shit.

498
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,655
Life is very complicated.

499
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:56,865
- Yeah.

500
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,533
- Love shouldn't be.

501
00:26:58,533 --> 00:26:59,367
- No.

502
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:04,539
- Okay, so we're
starting at the money,

503
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:07,709
the woman, and getting away.

504
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,044
What does he really want?

505
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:11,921
- What do you mean?

506
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:14,257
- Douglas, this is a love story.

507
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:17,677
He can only have one
want, one want and what.

508
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,058
- Well, no, no, he has to get
both the woman and the money.

509
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,893
Otherwise it's not a
happy Hollywood ending.

510
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,394
- Happy Hollywood ending depends

511
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:29,022
where you stop the
story, Douglas.

512
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,940
And the story only starts

513
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,942
when you know what
he really wants.

514
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:35,236
What he really wants
will drive the story.

515
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,533
- Yeah, that's actually,

516
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,079
that's really good
advice, I must say.

517
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,081
- It must be, if you must say.

518
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,459
Did you write yourself?

519
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:52,712
- No, I just know what I want.

520
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,798
- Hey, do you mind reading my,

521
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,091
my script when I'm done?

522
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,550
(door softly clatters) Okay.

523
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:07,435
(Douglas softly whistling)

524
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:11,398
(ominous music loudly building)

525
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:19,614
- [Dan] Whoa! Whoa!

526
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:23,618
(Dan softly laughing)

527
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,789
- You're so strong,
oh my god, hey, hey.

528
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:30,458
(dramatic pounding
drowns out Veronica)

529
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,961
- Let me ask you, let me ask
you, are you a Kenny G fan?

530
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:33,795
- Yes.

531
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:34,629
- You like Kenny G?

532
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:35,463
- I love Kenny G.

533
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:36,297
- Are you serious?

534
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:37,799
- [Veronica] Yes!

535
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,343
- Oh my god, Douglas, you
sandbagging son of a bitch.

536
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:41,845
You're holding out on me, huh?

537
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:44,472
I see, you're trying to keep
all the good shit to yourself.

538
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:48,768
You're amazing. (Veronica
loudly giggling)

539
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,602
Oh my God.

540
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:52,981
Your face right
now, it's like you,

541
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,942
tickled his O-ring mid stroke.

542
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,654
You okay?

543
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,868
Okay, well this has
been a good talk.

544
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,953
I will talk to you guys later.

545
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,164
See ya.

546
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,669
- Douglas, what was that?

547
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:24,679
Is this about last night?

548
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:28,516
(ominous music softly building)

549
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:29,976
- I don't see any eggs, Vee.

550
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:32,020
She said you're going to
the store to get some eggs.

551
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,022
You guys having too
much fun to get eggs?

552
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:36,691
- The store was closed,
the hours must've changed-

553
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:38,693
- Must've, mm-hm.

554
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:40,862
You know what, let's go down
there together right now,

555
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,530
me and you, we'll see
if they have eggs.

556
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,532
- Okay, maybe you need-
- I want eggs, I really want-

557
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:46,034
- A little space or something-
- Some eggs right now.

558
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,870
- To do whatever it is you
need to do to normalize but,

559
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,542
I don't know what to say to you.

560
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,024
(car softly honking)

561
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:18,775
- [Douglas] Hey.

562
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:23,238
- You startled me.

563
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,697
- Oh, I'm sorry.

564
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,534
I'm going to the general
store, do you want a ride?

565
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:28,368
- [Pia] No.

566
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:30,954
- Eggs.

567
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:32,914
They didn't come
back with any eggs.

568
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,415
So I'm gonna go get some eggs.

569
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,126
If you...

570
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:42,590
- Open.

571
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:47,595
- Oh, shit, I'm sorry,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

572
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:48,596
- No.
- Shit,

573
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:49,430
I'm sorry, yeah, perfect.

574
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,119
I'm sorry, I'm just really
in my head right now.

575
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:18,585
(radio softly clicks)
(soft moody guitar music)

576
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:21,296
(radio softly clicks)

577
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:24,132
- Learn to love the quiet.

578
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,466
It has so much to show you.

579
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:35,435
(birds softly chirping)

580
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:51,659
Only keep the important one.

581
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:52,493
Speak only good?

582
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:55,288
- Speak no evil.

583
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,039
- Sure.

584
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:57,999
- They have a,

585
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:02,670
there's a fair in the
square every fall.

586
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,507
I won that the first time we
came up here, me and Veer.

587
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,011
We used to come up here

588
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:13,806
as a place to escape everything.

589
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:17,310
Now it just seems like
we come up here to hide.

590
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,814
But yeah, I guess I did, I
did keep the important one.

591
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:22,690
Speak no evil.

592
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,526
- Only good.

593
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:28,029
- Only good, when I can.

594
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:31,866
Let's go.

595
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:37,497
(women softly chattering)
- There's no way, yeah.

596
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:38,706
- [Woman] Yeah, and you
didn't know about it?

597
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:39,540
- [2nd Woman] No.

598
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,042
- [Woman] Oh, yeah.

599
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:45,672
- [2nd Woman] My husband
(women softly chattering)

600
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:48,341
- [Woman] Oh, I'm glad
he let you come here.

601
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,927
- [Woman 2] Yes, yesterday
was beautiful anyway.

602
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,053
- Aw, thank you.
- So I can't wait

603
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,221
to see you again.

604
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,055
- Oh, you too.
- Thank you so much.

605
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,348
Nice to see you, bye.

606
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,058
- Nice to see you too, bye.

607
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,059
- Hi. Dee Dee.

608
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:58,893
- Douglas.

609
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:01,688
And friend?

610
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:03,398
- This is Pia.

611
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,899
Can I call you friend?

612
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,401
- I don't know, can you?

613
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:08,861
Pia.

614
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:10,405
- Dee Dee.

615
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,073
- Close friend, she and
her husband are her for,

616
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:14,742
I don't know, just to get
away from the city for a bit.

617
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:17,453
- Oh, how are you liking it?

618
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:19,914
(speaking French)

619
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,416
- Great.

620
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:22,583
- That's French.

621
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,544
- Oh, well, what can
I do for you two?

622
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:27,422
- Just gonna get some supplies.

623
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,257
Hey, Vero was here earlier,

624
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,592
she said you guys
were closed, that,

625
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:32,760
you change your store hours?

626
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,137
- I was here a
couple minutes late,

627
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:37,098
but the store has
the same hours.

628
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,933
(soft ominous music)
- Okay.

629
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:42,562
Okay.

630
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:43,771
- Yeah.

631
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,106
- We're just gonna
go get the shit

632
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,607
that we're supposed to get.

633
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:49,277
- All right, you go ahead, hon.

634
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:52,947
(Pia speaks French)

635
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:54,574
That's a nice shirt, I like it.

636
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,784
- Thanks.

637
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:59,787
(soft ominous music)

638
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,965
Do you mind if I
stop for a second?

639
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:23,018
(speaking French)

640
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:29,108
- For me, it's wheat
bread, prosciutto,

641
00:34:30,275 --> 00:34:31,444
and a two-minute egg.

642
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,656
(speaking French)

643
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,995
I can live without
the prosciutto today.

644
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:46,000
(speaking French)

645
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,799
- How well do you know Dan?

646
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,513
- How well should I?

647
00:34:58,513 --> 00:34:59,388
- You married him.

648
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:02,517
You should know him the best.

649
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,227
- Then that's how
much I know him.

650
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,187
- Is that enough?

651
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,232
- For me it is.

652
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:18,032
The trouble you're feeling,

653
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:21,369
is about Veronica?

654
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,164
- Yeah.

655
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,043
- Is it something she's done?

656
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,879
Or something you
think she has done?

657
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,385
- I don't know anymore.

658
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,054
- When do you?

659
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,561
Two things we should
never get angry with,

660
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:52,733
things we can change, and
the things we cannot change.

661
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,737
- That doesn't make any sense.

662
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:59,740
(Pia softly laughs)

663
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:10,251
- What if it wasn't us that
needs to know them well?

664
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,260
- Oh, your egg, um-

665
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,928
- Two-minute egg.

666
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:22,597
- Not a word of this
to Veronica, okay?

667
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,599
- Ooh, a secret.

668
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:30,730
(ominous music loudly building)

669
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,470
(music drowns out Dan)
- No.

670
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:06,641
(Veronica softly giggles)

671
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:07,850
- Oh, hey, guys.
- Hi.

672
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:12,521
- Hey, babe.

673
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:13,356
You good?

674
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,482
- Yeah.

675
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,817
(Douglas and Dan softly chuckle)

676
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:18,527
- All right, come on.

677
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:32,166
- I normalized, so, yay.

678
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,506
- Okay.

679
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,007
- Look, look, but I, look, I'm,

680
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,385
I'm sorry, dammit, okay?

681
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:43,803
I'm sorry.

682
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:46,138
Look, I don't know
what I'm doing here.

683
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:48,849
I'm not the jealous
type, you know that.

684
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:50,685
- "I, I, I."

685
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:54,021
You really wanna
show me you care?

686
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,856
Think about me first, for once.

687
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:03,864
(ominous music
softly distorting)

688
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:21,757
- All right, so I'm
thinking about brownies,

689
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:23,050
you guys want some brownies?

690
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,218
- Yeah.

691
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:25,052
- [Dan] All right,
babe, you're gonna cook

692
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:25,886
some brownies for us?

693
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:27,179
- [Pia] Yeah, sure.

694
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:28,389
- [Dan] Okay, come
on, get over here.

695
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,682
She's hot, she's gonna
make some brownies.

696
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:30,516
- I like this.

697
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:31,350
- Oh, thank you.

698
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,561
- "I, I, I."

699
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,396
You really wanna
show me you care?

700
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,898
Think about me first.

701
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:39,233
- Danish?
- Danish, yeah.

702
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,901
- She says danish,
I don't understand.

703
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:44,238
Yeah, but it's good,
it's a one-day trip,

704
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:47,575
wine-tasting, it's fun,
it's up in Santa Ynez.

705
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:48,576
Babe, Santa Ynez?

706
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,535
- I don't know, baby.

707
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:50,786
- Spain.

708
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:55,458
(ominous music building
and distorting)

709
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:23,110
- [Veronica] "I, I, I."

710
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,737
Think about me first.

711
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:33,079
- I swear to god,
listen, listen, listen.

712
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,288
So, you remember this?

713
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:36,082
Gary comes and he kicks
open the goddam door,

714
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,458
and he's holding
his cheeks together,

715
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:38,793
he's like, "Where's the
shitter, where's the shitter?"

716
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:39,668
He's gonna shit
all over himself,

717
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:40,753
I promise you.
- No.

718
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:46,592
- Stop the press.

719
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:47,468
Holy shit.

720
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:53,849
From a bearded clam to a
Brazilian-waxed beaver, whew!

721
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:58,020
Your puss just keeps getting
prettier and prettier, baby.

722
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,647
Come on in and sit
down, come on, come on,

723
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,982
sit down, the new man, huh?

724
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:05,528
I saved ya some, oh my
god, Hollywood, Hollywood!

725
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:08,489
Hey, man, welcome back.

726
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:13,494
You lookin' gorgeous,
Tom Cruise, I like it.

727
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,832
You guys throw a great party.

728
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,502
You must excuse me, I think
I've had too much of this.

729
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,172
There he is, there he
is, Hollywood, Hollywood!

730
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,301
Did I put it down or
did I put it down?

731
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:32,179
- You put it down.

732
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,394
What?

733
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:39,687
- No, man, I love
you, I love ya.

734
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,522
I'm gonna go take a piss.

735
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:43,691
- Dan.
- Thanks.

736
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,192
- What?
- TMI.

737
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:47,695
- Listen, what I coulda said
is I'm gonna take a dump,

738
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,363
but we just ate.
- Oh, wow.

739
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,865
- I'm not gonna be weird.

740
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,158
I'll be back, you guys.

741
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:00,040
- [Veronica] Sorry, your lips,

742
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:04,712
your lipstick, I'm
loving that shade.

743
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:08,382
It seems hydrating but not wet,

744
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:10,509
and your lips look so full.

745
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:12,761
- It's not a lipstick,
it's a gloss.

746
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:14,346
- Oh, what brand?
(phone softly vibrating)

747
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:16,849
Oh, I'm sorry, I
have to take this.

748
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,392
Hello, this is Veronica.

749
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,398
- It is a lipstick, I think.

750
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:26,859
- Really?

751
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,569
- Now we have two secrets.

752
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,284
- The owner put that chair there

753
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:19,954
like six months ago, it's new.

754
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:20,788
- Yeah?

755
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:25,459
- Yeah, they made it to
look old, but it's new.

756
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:38,806
- I like the, um-

757
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:39,640
- Oh.

758
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:41,934
Thanks.

759
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:44,770
Been a long time.

760
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,483
- Yeah?
- It feels good.

761
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:50,317
- Great.

762
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:53,153
- It looks better though, right?

763
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:57,950
- Why'd you shave it?

764
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:13,549
I never told Dan I didn't
like it, by the way.

765
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:16,510
- No?
- No.

766
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:21,181
It looks good.

767
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:24,351
Not better, but good.

768
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:26,687
(soft music)

769
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,034
I think I should go.

770
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:41,410
- But do you though?

771
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,244
- Yeah.

772
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:53,547
- Veronica.

773
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:54,882
- [Dan] Veronica!

774
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:59,219
Veronica, Veronica!

775
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:02,056
- Here's the one I
was telling you about.

776
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,223
- No, I couldn't.

777
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:05,225
- Yes, you could,
and you should.

778
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:07,061
It's gonna look
much better on you.

779
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:11,065
- Yeah?

780
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:15,527
- Yeah, your skin tone and
the warmth of it, definitely.

781
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,073
- Okay.

782
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,074
- Oh, may I?

783
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:28,916
It's okay, it's okay.

784
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:35,214
Perfect, come, I have so
much more to show you.

785
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:45,432
- Thanks for getting Dan
to come up, by the way.

786
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:47,935
I don't know if I said that

787
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:50,104
with everything going
on, it's just...

788
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:54,733
- He misses you guys,
even if he won't say so.

789
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:57,611
I miss him too.

790
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:00,155
And you.

791
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:05,619
- How have things been
since the funeral?

792
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:11,166
- Hard sometimes, he feels
guilty, like it's his fault.

793
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:20,592
(Pia speaking foreign language)

794
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:22,136
- What?

795
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:24,638
- Beautiful, more
beautiful than when,

796
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:27,349
when Lance tried to kill
you at the Hollywood sign.

797
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,935
- Oh, on the show.

798
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:34,773
That episode was over 10
years ago, so I doubt that...

799
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:41,321
Oh my god.

800
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:47,453
- Hey, I'm making mix.

801
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,500
Dougie, hey!

802
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,668
- What's that?

803
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:57,045
- This is a, it's
called liquid courage.

804
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:58,338
Little potion I'm making.

805
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:02,384
You want?

806
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:04,178
- Yeah.

807
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,179
- Okay.

808
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:07,181
You, you just go wait for me,

809
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,724
I'll be out in a
second, all right?

810
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,978
Yo, you think I'm
gonna roofie you?

811
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:15,647
Listen, if I wanted to fuck you,

812
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:17,149
I'd want you to
see it coming, man.

813
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:20,861
Every inch, balls deep, leaving
my DNA all over your walls.

814
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:23,030
Yeah, just go out, I'll
be out in a second.

815
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:47,095
I call this A Goddam Shame.

816
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:47,930
- Why?

817
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:50,891
- I don't know, that's what
it's fucking called, man.

818
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:55,229
Spiced rum, mezcal, spiced
Clamato, it's genius.

819
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,569
Hey, what's the difference
between a baby and a trampoline?

820
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:07,908
I take off my cleats to
jump on a trampoline.

821
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:11,453
(Dan loudly laughs)
Come on, bro, come on.

822
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:12,704
There was a time, man,

823
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:14,373
you woulda pissed
yourself at that joke.

824
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:21,755
So, what do you think about Rob?

825
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:23,257
- Dan, I'm not going back.

826
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,926
- I know, I know, I know, but
just, come on, just humor me.

827
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:30,931
- Better than you.
(Dan loudly laughs)

828
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:31,765
- He's better than me?

829
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:33,267
Fuck you, man.

830
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:35,269
The day I take shit from this
job's the day I walk away.

831
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,229
But seriously, man,
like as a manager.

832
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,899
- As a manager, he's adequate.

833
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:42,609
He's a better salesman
than a manager.

834
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,153
- I don't know,
it's kind of like

835
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:47,155
that script you
wrote about us, bro.

836
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:49,157
- Dan, I've already told
you, it wasn't about you.

837
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:50,617
It was fiction.

838
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:51,618
- Fiction my diction, man.

839
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:52,953
- That's not even a sentence.

840
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:55,122
- Anyways, look, it
doesn't matter, anyways.

841
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:57,624
So hey, you remember, you
remember the circle, right?

842
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:58,834
- Yeah.

843
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,961
- Okay, so we're in the
circle and we're talking

844
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:04,172
about this pipeline and this
guy and Rob starts Jonning on

845
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:05,966
about a fucking
job he's working.

846
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:07,467
- Get the fuck outta here.

847
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:09,970
- No, I'm serious, and this
guy doesn't talk about shit

848
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:12,806
unless he's closing a deal
and he knows he closed it.

849
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:15,809
But there Rob was,
out of character,

850
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:19,146
sweating like a blind bull
dyke in a fish market.

851
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,816
Apparently the office
manager was a chink.

852
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:24,985
- No, no, no.
- Mm-hm, mm-hm.

853
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:28,655
And you know what they say,
chink's a jinx, Dougie.

854
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:31,283
Those slanty-eyed,
abacus-loving fucks.

855
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:33,160
They see right through
us, guys like you and me,

856
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,161
see right through us.

857
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:39,499
I'm talking about Rob,
never needed advice

858
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:43,378
in the history of motherfucking
advice, until he did.

859
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:47,674
Kinda like you, man.

860
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:51,970
So I'm gonna tell
you what I told him.

861
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:58,143
Bail.

862
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:01,480
They can see you coming, buddy.

863
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,191
Doesn't matter by
hook or by crook,

864
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,360
you ain't gonna get what you
want, not the way you want it.

865
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,528
(soft ominous music)

866
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:12,032
Hey, what do you do when
I look you in the eyes

867
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:15,160
and I tell you that
I can see you coming?

868
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:18,872
(ominous music loudly building)

869
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:20,374
(Dan loudly laughs)

870
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,542
Your face right now, man.

871
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:25,045
Like someone took
a shit in your hat.

872
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:27,923
Oh anyways, the deal
Rob was working,

873
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,549
he lost a shirt, we all did.

874
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:32,719
But...

875
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:37,933
Some fucking guy caught up
with him in the parking lot

876
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:42,187
and he just beat the fuck out
of him, like fucked him up.

877
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:43,730
His eyes hanging out
of his fucking head,

878
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:46,608
his nose smashed in, man,
blood everywhere, fuck.

879
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:48,860
Was crazy, man.

880
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,863
But I guess, you know,

881
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:54,574
that's the price you pay
for what you want, right?

882
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:57,869
What did that douchebag,
Pakowski, say?

883
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:01,123
"Find what you love
and let it kill you."

884
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:06,753
Doug, whatever it is you're
chasing, I hope you love it.

885
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:08,213
Cheers to you, motherfucker.

886
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,136
It's A Goddam Shame.

887
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:29,276
- May I?

888
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:46,001
Do you like yourself,

889
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,127
who you are today?

890
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,506
- Kinda have to, wouldn't I?

891
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,135
- I mean there's...

892
00:50:57,971 --> 00:50:59,806
Makes you wonder, doesn't it?

893
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:05,312
What if you spent
your entire life

894
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,980
running away from who you were

895
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:11,151
only to realize that you
were running towards it?

896
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:23,497
- I'm not the same person I was.

897
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:24,331
- No?

898
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:28,710
(soft ominous music)

899
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,674
So the truth is not
that Dan ate your lunch

900
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:36,134
and now you want to eat me?

901
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:43,683
He shoved his cock so
deep into her, you know?

902
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:46,520
The surprise in her face.

903
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:48,730
He loved it,

904
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:54,986
watching her
discover every thick,

905
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:57,864
veiny inch until
he exploded in her.

906
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:00,325
And she came too.

907
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,537
So many times.

908
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:06,581
More than with anyone else.

909
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:09,751
More than with you.

910
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:12,212
(ominous music loudly building)

911
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:13,255
She loved it.

912
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:17,759
In fact, she liked
it so much that...

913
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:24,015
She only thinks of him
when she's with you.

914
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:30,605
And here you are, trying
so hard to make her come.

915
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:36,236
But she only comes when she's
with you thinking of him.

916
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:40,574
(ominous music
loudly intensifying)

917
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:50,792
- What's going on?

918
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:54,754
Dammit, Pia.

919
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:01,595
Would it matter if I said
it doesn't mean anything?

920
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:05,557
No?

921
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:11,396
I mean, it's just, have you
seen the cock on that guy?

922
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:15,609
(softly laughs) You
have, haven't you?

923
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:18,153
Then you know

924
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:20,780
after him,

925
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:23,450
you're not enough.

926
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:34,127
- The new you is the old you

927
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:39,633
with a sensitive
stomach and no fangs.

928
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:43,303
He can still bite if
you want to, I know it.

929
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:46,681
Just fucking do it.

930
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:49,100
Do it.

931
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:51,853
Do it.

932
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:02,864
(soft tranquil vocal music)

933
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:53,373
(loudly descending
into haunting vocals)

934
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:08,722
- Dan!

935
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:10,724
You're so good!

936
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,684
- Mwah! Wow.

937
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:13,727
That's all it takes
to get your wife

938
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:15,562
to scream my name, Dougie?

939
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:17,188
I wish Pia were that easy.

940
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:18,023
Babe, what?

941
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:25,947
All right, well, I know this
is a dangerous proposition but,

942
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,243
Dougie, do you wanna
chose the wine?

943
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:33,872
- Sure.
- Okay, stop.

944
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:35,081
I know what you're thinking.

945
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:37,083
You're thinking
chicken, white wine,

946
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:38,918
but that's poor
critical thinking.

947
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:42,756
This is roasted
chicken, it's dark meat.

948
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:47,594
So pairs red with the red.

949
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:48,970
It pairs good with the red.

950
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:54,434
Come on, chop, chop,
hurry up, buddy.

951
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:55,268
- Okay.

952
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:58,271
- Why don't you bring them both?

953
00:55:58,271 --> 00:55:59,647
- [Douglas] Okay.

954
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:02,776
- So, we're going
to the canyons.

955
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:03,943
- Pinot grigio, please.
- I think it'd be cool

956
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:05,403
if you came with us.

957
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:07,113
- I would love to go.

958
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:09,616
- Oh, top me off,
buddy, thank you.

959
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:12,452
- Babe.
- Thank you.

960
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:13,995
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Sorry about that.

961
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:15,955
- It's okay, it's okay.

962
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:19,084
He was a dunce in class.

963
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:23,630
So Dougie, what's this
strip you're writing?

964
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:24,464
- Script.

965
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:25,465
- Script?

966
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:27,008
- You said strip, it's script.

967
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:28,259
- Did I say that?
- Yeah.

968
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:29,928
- Well, you know
what I mean, right?

969
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:34,307
All right, so Vero tells
me that it's about a heist.

970
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:36,810
(Dan softly laughing)

971
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,603
I thought you were supposed
to write what you know, man.

972
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:40,647
What the fuck do you
know about a robbery?

973
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:44,609
- I guess about the same as you.

974
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:48,530
- There he is.

975
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:51,449
Okay.

976
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:52,283
All right, well,

977
00:56:54,869 --> 00:56:56,204
you know, it's funny 'cause

978
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:01,334
Veronica tells me
that you're in a jam

979
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:03,002
and you're stuck and
you can't get out of it.

980
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:06,339
I just, you don't wanna flap
your gums about it, it's fine.

981
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:10,009
I'm just, see what shakes
loose, just say so.

982
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:10,802
- [Douglas] So.

983
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:14,472
- [Pia] Dan, stop it now.

984
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:17,058
- All right.
- Dan-

985
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:18,351
- No, no, no, no.
(Pia whispering in French)

986
00:57:18,351 --> 00:57:20,311
- No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, this guy's

987
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:21,396
rockin' is granny panties.
- He doesn't wanna

988
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:22,355
talk about it.
- Listen, Doug knows,

989
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:23,648
Dougie knows me.

990
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:27,026
If he wants to tell
me to fuck off,

991
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:28,319
just tell me to fuck off.

992
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:33,491
- It's okay.

993
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:35,243
I can, let him talk, Pia.

994
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:39,706
So Dan, what is my jam?

995
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:42,375
And how can I fix it?

996
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:46,087
- Should I?
- Yeah.

997
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:52,385
- Look, I'm just
here to help, buddy.

998
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:54,053
If you don't wanna
talk, you don't talk,

999
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:56,222
I just wanna help, right, Vero?

1000
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:57,724
- Yeah, he really does.

1001
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:03,396
- Dan wants to help me?

1002
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:05,106
Dan wants to help me?

1003
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:08,776
Dan wants to help me?

1004
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:10,028
(Douglas softly laughing)
- Yeah, I'm just,

1005
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:12,071
I'm just here to
help you out, buddy.

1006
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:15,408
(Douglas loudly cackling)

1007
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:17,118
- Dan wants to help me!

1008
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:18,286
That's so awesome.

1009
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:21,581
I love it, I love it, I love it.

1010
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:26,377
(Douglas loudly cackling)

1011
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:34,385
I'm so lucky. (softly mumbling)

1012
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:37,889
(Douglas loudly cackling)

1013
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:50,777
Dan wants to help me.

1014
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:55,782
Dan can't even help himself.

1015
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,784
- [Dan] Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop.

1016
00:58:57,784 --> 00:58:59,494
No, finish, Dan can't do what?

1017
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:00,328
- Help yourself.

1018
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:01,329
- [Dan] What can't I do?

1019
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:13,466
- The first thing they
teach you in Sales 101-

1020
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:14,467
- Yes, it's three yeses-

1021
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:16,094
- I'm fucking talking to you!

1022
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:18,304
- [Veronica] Douglas.

1023
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:21,099
- Sorry, yes, it's
the three yeses.

1024
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:25,770
The last thing they
teach to a fucking retard

1025
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:31,526
who doesn't grasp the basic
rudimentary, fundamental

1026
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:34,487
nuances of sales is, guess what,

1027
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:37,365
those same three goddam
yeses, and you know why?

1028
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:38,825
Because it doesn't
take intelligence.

1029
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:39,993
It doesn't take skills.

1030
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:43,162
It doesn't take creativity.

1031
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:46,291
It doesn't take a
fucking functional brain.

1032
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:51,838
All you have to do is
think of three things.

1033
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:53,840
Three, three little things

1034
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:58,136
that can make someone say yes.

1035
00:59:58,136 --> 01:00:00,305
And you get them in the
habit of saying yes.

1036
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:03,725
Like for example, is
Dan a fucking idiot?

1037
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:05,018
Yes.

1038
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:08,855
Is
Dan a
piece-of-shit-motherfucking-lowe

1039
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:10,523
fucking-cocksucker liar?

1040
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:11,816
Yes.

1041
01:00:11,816 --> 01:00:13,526
Is Dan the worst salesman

1042
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:16,529
in the history of
motherfucking history?

1043
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:17,697
Well, you guys probably
don't know the answer

1044
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:18,698
to this question but
I'm gonna lead you

1045
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:20,575
in the right direction, okay?

1046
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:23,369
Follow me, the
Wasserman account.

1047
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:24,704
I had that lead first, right?

1048
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:25,913
We can agree on that.

1049
01:00:25,913 --> 01:00:27,206
- That's right.
- I took a run at it

1050
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:29,375
and nothing clicked, so
then I left the company

1051
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:33,212
and did Rob give it to you, Dan?

1052
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:34,047
Fuck no.

1053
01:00:35,506 --> 01:00:37,717
Rob wouldn't give you a fucking
lead with fucking shit, man.

1054
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:40,845
You fucking choke on fucking
water, you fucking simp!

1055
01:00:40,845 --> 01:00:45,058
(ominous music softly building)

1056
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:47,060
No, Rob gave it
to, remember Rubin?

1057
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:51,606
And then he gave it to,
I think it was Scott.

1058
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:53,733
And then every
motherfucking hand

1059
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:56,903
in that motherfucking company
touched that motherfucker.

1060
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:59,238
So then, Rob give it to Dan.

1061
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,742
What could go wrong?

1062
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:05,286
I mean, I've already, I don't
have any expectations here.

1063
01:01:05,286 --> 01:01:06,913
So you got your
fucking hands on it.

1064
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:09,082
And you fucking hack.

1065
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:12,460
You took my shit,
my tools to get in

1066
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:15,088
and you're luckier than a
fucking dog with two dicks.

1067
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:17,256
You're lucky because
Wasserman came in when he did.

1068
01:01:18,257 --> 01:01:19,092
Look at me.

1069
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:22,261
You got shit on.

1070
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:23,763
That's all you did,
you got shit on,

1071
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:26,474
you got lucky and you
didn't fuck it up, Dan!

1072
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:28,434
Congratulations, Dan.

1073
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:29,936
That's, I think, the truth.

1074
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,647
If I'm not mistaken, we're
all friends here, so.

1075
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:33,773
- Yeah, I guess,

1076
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:36,109
I guess we are friends, yeah.
- Yeah,

1077
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:37,610
so is Dan the worst
fucking salesman

1078
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:40,113
in the history of fucking
salesman salesman sales,

1079
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:41,948
are you a bad fucking salesman?

1080
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:43,616
Yes, you are.

1081
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:46,452
I stomach you
because I like Pia.

1082
01:01:46,452 --> 01:01:47,495
And for the life of
me, I can't figure out

1083
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:50,331
what the fuck she sees in you.

1084
01:01:50,331 --> 01:01:51,165
Are you a hostage?

1085
01:01:51,165 --> 01:01:52,792
Tell me right now.

1086
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:55,086
Blink twice for yes and once
for no, just fucking blink.

1087
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:59,298
I mean, literally, what do
you fucking see in this guy?

1088
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:07,932
Motherfucker said red.

1089
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:15,648
- I'm so sorry.

1090
01:02:36,502 --> 01:02:38,838
- Well, you said it yourself.

1091
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:40,882
He's 1000 times more obnoxious.

1092
01:02:43,217 --> 01:02:45,136
- So he had it coming?

1093
01:02:45,136 --> 01:02:47,638
You think what he
did makes you even?

1094
01:02:47,638 --> 01:02:48,514
- Fuck even.

1095
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:52,018
Just one more day, right?

1096
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:54,896
- I know he can
be a lot sometimes

1097
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:55,855
but he's a good friend.

1098
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:56,981
- He is?

1099
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:58,357
A good friend?

1100
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:02,403
- He drove all the
way out here for you

1101
01:03:02,403 --> 01:03:04,238
to be here for you,
can't you see that?

1102
01:03:04,238 --> 01:03:06,073
- Drop the act, Vero.

1103
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:11,037
(soft haunting piano music)

1104
01:03:12,663 --> 01:03:13,498
What's that?

1105
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:18,503
Why is the picture
under the dresser again?

1106
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:22,381
What the hell?

1107
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:26,719
I'm gonna take it that
wasn't lost, right?

1108
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:29,555
- No.

1109
01:03:29,555 --> 01:03:31,849
- You wanna talk about it?

1110
01:03:31,849 --> 01:03:32,683
- I don't.

1111
01:03:35,269 --> 01:03:38,397
Normally, I'm an open
book, but I just,

1112
01:03:38,397 --> 01:03:39,899
I can't do this right now.

1113
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:40,733
- Obviously not.

1114
01:03:43,027 --> 01:03:45,530
You know, but this is us.

1115
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:49,909
This is what we wanted.

1116
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:54,413
- It's the us you wanted.

1117
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,459
And there's nothing
wrong with that

1118
01:03:58,459 --> 01:04:00,711
but have you ever really
looked at that picture?

1119
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:03,422
How happy do I look?

1120
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:07,718
Or do I look like someone
who's life is about to be over?

1121
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:14,100
Do you know what kind of jobs
aging soap actresses get?

1122
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:17,103
Not the ones that are hot moms

1123
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:18,938
but the ones they just age?

1124
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:23,651
Trick question,
they don't get any.

1125
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:25,611
In that weekend,

1126
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:29,574
the network randomly decided
to make me the mother

1127
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:31,158
of a 16-year-old.

1128
01:04:34,495 --> 01:04:35,329
- So?

1129
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:39,458
- I don't want to
be anyone's mother.

1130
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:41,460
I'm Kendall fucking James.

1131
01:04:42,795 --> 01:04:43,963
- You're not.

1132
01:04:45,172 --> 01:04:45,965
- I am.

1133
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:49,260
And overnight I'm 16 years older

1134
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:52,013
with a life I never wanted.

1135
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:54,515
And you made me celebrate it.

1136
01:05:02,648 --> 01:05:07,320
- When I look at that picture
I see the beginning of us.

1137
01:05:10,114 --> 01:05:11,449
I don't see this.

1138
01:05:12,825 --> 01:05:13,659
All this.

1139
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:18,664
That guy downstairs,

1140
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:25,004
I just...

1141
01:05:29,216 --> 01:05:32,178
You didn't like what I did for
a living and I quit my job.

1142
01:05:36,557 --> 01:05:40,519
You didn't like who
I was as a person.

1143
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:41,896
And I became this.

1144
01:05:46,651 --> 01:05:48,861
You don't like the
way I make love.

1145
01:05:57,703 --> 01:06:00,706
I'm not even in my
own skin anymore.

1146
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:09,048
Why aren't I enough?

1147
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:10,716
Why aren't I enough?

1148
01:06:14,512 --> 01:06:16,347
- Because I want more.

1149
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:23,062
- Like Dan?

1150
01:06:25,856 --> 01:06:26,691
- Yeah.

1151
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:28,567
Like Dan.

1152
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:35,032
I told you I didn't
wanna talk about this.

1153
01:06:35,032 --> 01:06:38,202
(soft haunting music)

1154
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:30,129
- Sorry.

1155
01:07:30,129 --> 01:07:31,297
- Oh, it's fine.

1156
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:32,506
- Didn't know you were
here, I would have-

1157
01:07:32,506 --> 01:07:33,966
- You'd have stayed
in the bedroom?

1158
01:07:33,966 --> 01:07:35,468
(both softly chuckle) Thirsty?

1159
01:07:37,344 --> 01:07:41,182
(soft muffled jazz on stereo)

1160
01:07:50,941 --> 01:07:55,154
- I read your
script a little bit.

1161
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:56,113
- Oh, yeah?

1162
01:07:58,657 --> 01:07:59,825
What'd you think?

1163
01:08:01,118 --> 01:08:02,495
- It's who you are today.

1164
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:10,503
You weren't in the same when
you wrote the other one.

1165
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:11,879
It reads like it.

1166
01:08:12,713 --> 01:08:14,799
- Is that good or bad?

1167
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:19,804
- It's honest.

1168
01:08:21,013 --> 01:08:21,846
May I?

1169
01:08:22,681 --> 01:08:23,724
- Oh, please.

1170
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:33,526
- Hmm, it's good.

1171
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:35,693
- What, the script or the?

1172
01:08:38,363 --> 01:08:41,325
- Okay, so, what
does Jacques want?

1173
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:46,496
The money, the girl,
or to get away?

1174
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:50,709
- Well, one doesn't work
without the other, so.

1175
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:52,545
- That's not true.

1176
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:55,214
If that's really what he wants,

1177
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:56,506
he's in a pickle.

1178
01:08:57,591 --> 01:08:59,425
What, it's not
the way to say it?

1179
01:08:59,425 --> 01:09:01,512
- No, it is, it's, go on.

1180
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:05,224
- Okay, so the
police surrounds him

1181
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:08,394
and he's got the money.

1182
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:10,728
But if he takes it,
he loses the girl

1183
01:09:10,728 --> 01:09:13,232
because she doesn't
like stealing.

1184
01:09:13,232 --> 01:09:16,568
But in your setup he needs
the money, always has.

1185
01:09:16,568 --> 01:09:17,403
- Yes.

1186
01:09:18,362 --> 01:09:21,407
- And there, the
girl comes along

1187
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:25,369
and he really wants
her bad, infatuation?

1188
01:09:26,578 --> 01:09:28,539
- It's more than
infatuation, I think.

1189
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:32,585
- And the police threatens

1190
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:35,421
to take both possibilities away.

1191
01:09:37,089 --> 01:09:39,758
- That's the gist, yeah.

1192
01:09:39,758 --> 01:09:41,260
- Okay, so for me, it's clear.

1193
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:44,596
He needs to pick one.

1194
01:09:46,389 --> 01:09:49,434
Stability, desire, or freedom.

1195
01:09:51,937 --> 01:09:53,104
- How? You can't.

1196
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:57,610
- Why are you so
afraid to choose?

1197
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:05,409
It's only the choice he's
making him in that moment.

1198
01:10:05,409 --> 01:10:07,286
Okay, let me help you choose.

1199
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:08,954
Let's try stability.

1200
01:10:09,955 --> 01:10:10,831
- Why stability?

1201
01:10:10,831 --> 01:10:12,458
- Because the cost of stability

1202
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:14,627
is diminished
opportunity to grow.

1203
01:10:18,255 --> 01:10:19,089
- Says who?

1204
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:22,300
- Sheryl Sandberg, for one.

1205
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:23,469
- Who's Sheryl-

1206
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:25,930
- Just choose
opportunity to grow.

1207
01:10:28,139 --> 01:10:31,018
- I'm just afraid I'm gonna
make the wrong choice.

1208
01:10:31,018 --> 01:10:34,103
- There is no wrong
choice, if it's honest.

1209
01:10:36,815 --> 01:10:38,651
(soft music)

1210
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:39,485

1233
01:12:49,156 --> 01:12:50,949
What are you doing, Douglas?

1234
01:12:50,949 --> 01:12:52,242
- Making a choice.

1235
01:12:52,242 --> 01:12:54,119
It's not wrong if
it's honest, right?

1236
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:56,789
You want this too, right?

1237
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:00,959
What just happened?

1238
01:13:00,959 --> 01:13:02,628
- You are who you were today.

1239
01:13:04,129 --> 01:13:06,090
- The same little guy with a,

1240
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:09,134
with a sensitive
stomach and dull fangs?

1241
01:13:09,134 --> 01:13:10,928
- You said it, not me.

1242
01:13:23,982 --> 01:13:27,653
(soft haunting piano music)

1243
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:54,012
(haunting music softly building)

1244
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:28,589
(soft dramatic orchestral music)

1245
01:14:36,513 --> 01:14:39,850
(birds softly chirping)

1246
01:15:10,088 --> 01:15:10,923
- You guys up?

1247
01:15:12,132 --> 01:15:13,300
- He's still sleeping.

1248
01:15:14,593 --> 01:15:16,594
- I'm gonna go for a run.

1249
01:15:16,594 --> 01:15:17,888
You wanna join?

1250
01:15:17,888 --> 01:15:20,098
- God no, I don't run
unless I'm being chased.

1251
01:15:21,892 --> 01:15:24,770
- I don't think he will
be up for breakfast.

1252
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:25,603
- Copy that.

1253
01:15:59,471 --> 01:16:00,472
Surprised you're up.

1254
01:16:01,306 --> 01:16:03,433
- Yeah, me too.

1255
01:16:03,433 --> 01:16:04,934
Did you make coffee?

1256
01:16:04,934 --> 01:16:05,769
- I did.

1257
01:16:05,769 --> 01:16:07,145
- Oh, oh, you got it?

1258
01:16:07,145 --> 01:16:08,605
- Yep.
- Thank you.

1259
01:16:11,316 --> 01:16:12,317
- Hey, you seen Pia?

1260
01:16:13,277 --> 01:16:14,318
- She went for a run.

1261
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:18,657
- Dougie?

1262
01:16:19,657 --> 01:16:20,492
- No.

1263
01:16:27,499 --> 01:16:29,334
- He came to bed last
night though, right?

1264
01:16:35,674 --> 01:16:36,508
Hey,

1265
01:16:38,135 --> 01:16:39,636
Are you guys okay?

1266
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:42,723
- Not sure.

1267
01:16:51,398 --> 01:16:54,526
(soft ominous music)

1268
01:17:27,434 --> 01:17:31,605
- Hey. (Douglas
loudly breathing)

1269
01:17:33,106 --> 01:17:35,067
I've been coming up
here for all these years

1270
01:17:36,401 --> 01:17:38,695
and I've never seen this
before, it's crazy, huh?

1271
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:45,744
I think I know how it
ends now, my story.

1272
01:17:45,744 --> 01:17:46,870
- Yeah?

1273
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:47,746
- Yeah.
- You've written it?

1274
01:17:47,746 --> 01:17:49,121
- No.

1275
01:17:49,121 --> 01:17:51,083
- So how do you know?

1276
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:53,418
Things don't always go
the way we want, Douglas.

1277
01:17:54,585 --> 01:17:56,380
- Yeah, I'm picking
up this subtexty vibe

1278
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:57,755
that I'm hoping is
just that, a vibe.

1279
01:17:57,755 --> 01:17:58,757
(Pia softly mumbles in French)

1280
01:17:58,757 --> 01:17:59,925
Hey wait, wait, wait, wait!

1281
01:17:59,925 --> 01:18:01,385
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait wait.

1282
01:18:01,385 --> 01:18:03,053
I mean, can we both agree

1283
01:18:03,053 --> 01:18:04,554
that I'm walking
off a cliff here?

1284
01:18:04,554 --> 01:18:06,807
Like Wile E. Coyote and I'm
looking down at the same time?

1285
01:18:06,807 --> 01:18:08,600
- No one asked you
to do that, Douglas.

1286
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:09,976
- He's, that advice!

1287
01:18:09,976 --> 01:18:11,436
I mean, you came on...

1288
01:18:12,437 --> 01:18:14,773
I'm sorry, I'm, I'm scared, Pia.

1289
01:18:14,773 --> 01:18:17,317
Like I don't, I'm afraid
to do anything about this.

1290
01:18:17,317 --> 01:18:19,778
About, about
anything in general.

1291
01:18:19,778 --> 01:18:21,780
So I do nothing, I
don't do anything.

1292
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:23,907
I just, that's probably
why I don't do anything.

1293
01:18:23,907 --> 01:18:26,493
I just, I just
don't do anything.

1294
01:18:26,493 --> 01:18:29,663
You know, life has a way of
kicking your fucking teeth

1295
01:18:29,663 --> 01:18:31,164
down your throat,
you know what I mean?

1296
01:18:31,164 --> 01:18:32,916
You don't know which way
is up or down or sideways.

1297
01:18:32,916 --> 01:18:34,126
So you don't do nothing.

1298
01:18:34,126 --> 01:18:35,627
You just sit there,
you don't do nothing.

1299
01:18:35,627 --> 01:18:37,462
You get to feel okay though,
that whatever life gives you,

1300
01:18:37,462 --> 01:18:38,755
you just, you just accept it.

1301
01:18:38,755 --> 01:18:41,091
I mean, I haven't been doing,

1302
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:42,300
haven't been doing,
I've been doing nothing

1303
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:45,137
since I left Barossa
since I met Veronica.

1304
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:46,138
But then you, you showed me.

1305
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:46,972
- I didn't.

1306
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:48,264
- You showed me.

1307
01:18:48,264 --> 01:18:50,142
- It was about the
story, Douglas.

1308
01:18:50,142 --> 01:18:51,268
- It was about me.

1309
01:18:53,145 --> 01:18:55,188
The first time in a very,
very, very long time,

1310
01:18:55,188 --> 01:18:57,357
I am going to take
control of my life

1311
01:18:57,357 --> 01:18:58,358
and I'm gonna let,

1312
01:18:59,651 --> 01:19:01,111
I'm gonna hold the reigns

1313
01:19:01,111 --> 01:19:03,655
and I'm choosing
what happens to me.

1314
01:19:03,655 --> 01:19:04,531
What happens next.

1315
01:19:04,531 --> 01:19:05,657
- Yeah?

1316
01:19:05,657 --> 01:19:08,618
So tell me, what happened next?

1317
01:19:08,618 --> 01:19:11,329
- You, I don't care
about stability.

1318
01:19:11,329 --> 01:19:12,956
I don't care if we
get away with it.

1319
01:19:12,956 --> 01:19:16,001
Fuck Dan, fuck Veronica.

1320
01:19:16,001 --> 01:19:17,460
Whatever happens happens.

1321
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:20,005
As long as you're
with me, I just,

1322
01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:23,216
I don't care what happens next.

1323
01:19:23,216 --> 01:19:24,050
I don't.

1324
01:19:25,135 --> 01:19:26,178
You're my wanton want.

1325
01:19:28,889 --> 01:19:30,807
- [Dan] Dougie!

1326
01:19:30,807 --> 01:19:32,517
- [Veronica] Douglas!

1327
01:19:33,894 --> 01:19:37,022
(soft ominous music)

1328
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:43,068
- Stop pursuing, Douglas.

1329
01:19:43,068 --> 01:19:44,696
- Us, or this, or you?

1330
01:19:44,696 --> 01:19:45,989
Don't you want this?

1331
01:19:46,865 --> 01:19:48,532
Don't you want this?

1332
01:19:52,662 --> 01:19:54,371
You know you want this.
(Pia speaking French)

1333
01:19:54,371 --> 01:19:57,751
(ominous music building)

1334
01:19:59,544 --> 01:20:00,378
(Pia softly screams)

1335
01:20:00,378 --> 01:20:01,213
Shut up.

1336
01:20:02,714 --> 01:20:05,884
(Pia loudly screaming)

1337
01:20:10,055 --> 01:20:12,224
- What the fuck?

1338
01:20:12,224 --> 01:20:14,184
- What the fuck?

1339
01:20:14,184 --> 01:20:16,853
(Veronica loudly screams)

1340
01:20:16,853 --> 01:20:19,231
- Fucker, what the
fuck is wrong with you?

1341
01:20:21,441 --> 01:20:24,528
- You said you haven't
been coming, brother.

1342
01:20:24,528 --> 01:20:25,695
And don't you dare fucking
look at me like that.

1343
01:20:25,695 --> 01:20:27,030
You let that
fucking shit in you!

1344
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:28,907
Let him stick his shitty
fucking dick in you!

1345
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:31,201
- What the fuck are
you talking about?

1346
01:20:31,201 --> 01:20:32,410
- He told me, he told me.

1347
01:20:32,410 --> 01:20:35,705
He told me that when he
was on the couch, drunk.

1348
01:20:35,705 --> 01:20:37,457
"I'm such a good
friend, Douglas.

1349
01:20:37,457 --> 01:20:38,750
"I'm sorry for
fucking your wife,"

1350
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:39,584
like you're still
fucking Pauline.

1351
01:20:39,584 --> 01:20:40,585
- What do you want, man?

1352
01:20:40,585 --> 01:20:42,254
I'm not fucking your wife!

1353
01:20:42,254 --> 01:20:44,255
- [Pia] But you're
still fucking Gary's?

1354
01:20:45,924 --> 01:20:47,259
- Pia, Pia, Pia, wait-

1355
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:48,760
- Sorry.
- Pia, Pia?

1356
01:20:51,888 --> 01:20:52,639
- It's true.

1357
01:21:05,777 --> 01:21:08,737
- You are right, I
am not Kendall James,

1358
01:21:10,448 --> 01:21:14,911
because this, all of this would
have never happened to her.

1359
01:21:17,121 --> 01:21:18,331
I mean, if it did...

1360
01:21:25,088 --> 01:21:26,298
- But Dan said that-

1361
01:21:26,298 --> 01:21:28,967
- I don't give a
fuck what Dan said!

1362
01:21:31,969 --> 01:21:33,471
I didn't deserve this!

1363
01:21:34,472 --> 01:21:36,141
You are a fucking child!

1364
01:21:45,859 --> 01:21:47,193
Was it worth it?

1365
01:21:48,486 --> 01:21:49,321
All this?

1366
01:21:51,323 --> 01:21:52,157
Look at me.

1367
01:21:59,496 --> 01:22:00,874
Say it.

1368
01:22:00,874 --> 01:22:05,128
Say, "Yes, she was worth it."
- Absolutely.

1369
01:22:05,128 --> 01:22:06,338
Every goddam second.

1370
01:22:11,384 --> 01:22:12,218
- Thank you.

1371
01:22:14,387 --> 01:22:15,722
I wish you the worst.

1372
01:22:17,849 --> 01:22:19,351
The absolute worst.

1373
01:22:24,648 --> 01:22:27,859
(car softly starting up)

1374
01:22:27,859 --> 01:22:31,362
(car softly driving away)

1375
01:22:45,710 --> 01:22:49,214
- It's just, okay,
what if I get to Lebec?

1376
01:22:52,175 --> 01:22:53,343
How about to Grapevine?

1377
01:22:55,053 --> 01:22:56,846
What if I make it
to Bakersfield?

1378
01:22:56,846 --> 01:22:59,766
So if I get to Bakersfield,
you can get me?

1379
01:22:59,766 --> 01:23:00,600
No?

1380
01:23:01,851 --> 01:23:03,728
You know, there's a
bus in a couple days.

1381
01:23:03,728 --> 01:23:07,065
Just forget about it and I
cannot thank you for this.

1382
01:23:07,065 --> 01:23:08,858
All right, be well.

1383
01:23:08,858 --> 01:23:12,404
(soft haunting piano music)

1384
01:23:22,914 --> 01:23:24,416
Hey, it's me again.

1385
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:28,253
I'll just take the loan
ride, yeah, I'll pay for it.

1386
01:23:28,253 --> 01:23:29,587
Okay, great, thanks.

1387
01:23:31,255 --> 01:23:32,090
A minute?

1388
01:23:34,425 --> 01:23:35,927
I'll be downstairs, okay, bye.

1389
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:05,623
- What's worse than a
pile of dead babies?

1390
01:24:05,623 --> 01:24:09,085
The live one at the bottom
trying to eat its way out.

1391
01:24:09,085 --> 01:24:11,463
(loudly cackling)

1392
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:13,505
How the heaven are you, Dougie?

1393
01:24:15,133 --> 01:24:15,967
- I'm not Dougie.

1394
01:24:17,802 --> 01:24:19,304
And you're not you.

1395
01:24:20,972 --> 01:24:22,807
- And yet, here we are.

1396
01:24:28,772 --> 01:24:30,273
- You're not real.

1397
01:24:31,483 --> 01:24:34,110
- Come on, when has
that ever stopped us

1398
01:24:34,110 --> 01:24:38,156
in this crazy
tapestry of, you know.

1399
01:24:40,657 --> 01:24:45,038
Hey, where in Orion's
Belt did I have that last?

1400
01:24:45,996 --> 01:24:47,999
- At the backroom, before you...

1401
01:24:55,673 --> 01:24:58,175
(soft music)

1402
01:25:04,557 --> 01:25:05,892
Why'd you do it?

1403
01:25:10,730 --> 01:25:12,398
- Why does anybody do anything?

1404
01:25:15,193 --> 01:25:16,361
'Cause it's time.

1405
01:25:17,529 --> 01:25:18,862
'Cause it needs doing.

1406
01:25:21,032 --> 01:25:23,368
When the show's over,
they turn on the lights.

1407
01:25:26,037 --> 01:25:27,705
May I?

1408
01:25:27,705 --> 01:25:28,540
- Yeah.

1409
01:25:34,921 --> 01:25:36,214
- Just hang on.

1410
01:25:37,507 --> 01:25:39,092
You're good, brother.

1411
01:25:39,092 --> 01:25:42,053
(soft piano music)

1412
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:26,556
(soft uplifting piano music)

1413
01:26:58,421 --> 01:27:01,966
(lightly knocking at door)

1414
01:27:07,472 --> 01:27:08,306
- Pia.

1415
01:27:17,148 --> 01:27:18,608
Pia, I'm so sorry-

1416
01:27:18,608 --> 01:27:20,777
- Finish that sentence
and I'm out of here.

1417
01:27:40,338 --> 01:27:41,172
- Did you like what I-

1418
01:27:41,172 --> 01:27:42,005
- Did you care?

1419
01:27:43,633 --> 01:27:45,802
- Of course I, yeah.

1420
01:27:45,802 --> 01:27:46,636
No, I...

1421
01:27:48,304 --> 01:27:51,014
- Dan has the same pitiful
look when he looks at me.

1422
01:27:52,392 --> 01:27:55,228
The shame of knowing
that I know who you are.

1423
01:27:56,688 --> 01:27:58,982
That makes my pussy
dry , Douglas.

1424
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:07,699
- I just wanna see
if you're real.

1425
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:09,826
- Am I?
- Yeah

1426
01:28:14,163 --> 01:28:17,000
(speaking French)

1427
01:28:32,889 --> 01:28:35,226
A sensitive stomach
and dull fangs?

1428
01:28:37,228 --> 01:28:40,064
(speaking French)

1429
01:29:01,627 --> 01:29:04,213
I can't fix the man
you've become, Douglas.

1430
01:29:06,132 --> 01:29:07,258
Only you can.

1431
01:29:10,261 --> 01:29:12,972
(speaking French)

1432
01:29:15,725 --> 01:29:16,934
"I'm sorry, Pia."

1433
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:20,646
Yeah, you're sorry?

1434
01:29:22,607 --> 01:29:25,443
(speaking French)

1435
01:29:28,612 --> 01:29:30,948
You didn't happen
to me, Douglas.

1436
01:29:32,742 --> 01:29:33,951
I happened to you.

1437
01:29:34,952 --> 01:29:37,789
(speaking French)

1438
01:29:46,422 --> 01:29:47,255
Yeah.

1439
01:29:48,508 --> 01:29:50,968
Sensitive stomach
and dull fangs.

1440
01:29:56,349 --> 01:29:59,477
(speaking in French)

1441
01:30:18,204 --> 01:30:21,707
- I don't understand
a word you just said.

1442
01:30:22,791 --> 01:30:25,294
- If you stop the story here,

1443
01:30:25,294 --> 01:30:28,505
you have your happy
Hollywood ending, Douglas.

1444

01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:46,858
