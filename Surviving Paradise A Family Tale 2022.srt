00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,600
<i>In this land,</i>

4
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,120
<i>family is everything.</i>

5
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,560
<i>It's the bonds</i>
<i>within the pride,</i>

6
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,240
<i>the pack,</i>

7
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,120
<i>and the herd…</i>

8
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,240
<i>…that allow each member to succeed.</i>

9
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,200
<i>Nowhere are these bonds</i>
<i>tested more fiercely</i>

10
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,480
<i>than in the great Kalahari Desert.</i>

11
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,080
<i>Here families are shaped</i>

12
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,560
<i>by courageous mothers…</i>

13
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,200
<i>wise elders…</i>

14
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,080
<i>…and tenacious underdogs.</i>

15
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,520
<i>All drawn to the immense oasis</i>
<i>that lies at the desert's very heart.</i>

16
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,000
<i>The Okavango Delta.</i>

17
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,000
<i>Home to more wildlife</i>
<i>than any other wetland on Earth…</i>

18
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,520
<i>it is seeing</i>
<i>some of the most extreme seasonal change</i>

19
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,040
<i>on the planet.</i>

20
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,200
<i>Through the chaos</i>
<i>and hardship of the coming year…</i>

21
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,080
<i>fates will entwine,</i>

22
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,880
<i>and incredible relationships</i>
<i>will be forged.</i>

23
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,440
<i>Not just within families</i>
<i>but between families.</i>

24
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,920
<i>And even with the land itself.</i>

25
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,360
<i>For a two-year-old lioness,</i>

26
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,720
<i>the strength of family</i>
<i>comes from her pride.</i>

27
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,440
<i>She and her sisterhood</i>
<i>control this territory…</i>

28
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,560
<i>…and their lead male</i>
<i>reigns as warrior king.</i>

29
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,040
<i>But in the Delta, change can come suddenly</i>

30
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,360
<i>and upend a family's peaceful existence.</i>

31
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,520
<i>The chink in her pride's armor</i>
<i>is the king himself.</i>

32
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,560
<i>Years of fighting</i>
<i>to defend his family and territory</i>

33
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,120
<i>have taken their toll.</i>

34
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,840
<i>His weakness puts the lioness at risk.</i>

35
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,240
<i>And presents an opportunity</i>

36
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,920
<i>for two ambitious young males.</i>

37
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,080
<i>The old warrior</i>
<i>marks his territory.</i>

38
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,880
<i>But he's frail.</i>

39
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,240
<i>And outnumbered.</i>

40
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:21,160
<i>Every year in the Okavango</i>
<i>is a new and dangerous journey,</i>

41
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,920
<i>but for the lioness,</i>

42
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,520
<i>this year will be</i>
<i>the most uncertain she's ever faced.</i>

43
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,680
<i>Every family confronts</i>
<i>the challenges of the Delta</i>

44
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,880
<i>in its own way.</i>

45
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,520
<i>A pack</i>
<i>of painted wolves, 24 strong.</i>

46
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,360
<i>Their strength,</i>
<i>a testament to their great leader,</i>

47
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,520
<i>the alpha female.</i>

48
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,120
<i>She's trained them</i>
<i>to think and hunt as one.</i>

49
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,560
<i>And to provide for all.</i>

50
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,880
<i>But the alpha is pregnant.</i>

51
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,360
<i>Her team will lose their leader,</i>

52
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,720
<i>just as the Delta</i>
<i>faces its greatest upheaval.</i>

53
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,520
<i>It's May.</i>

54
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,880
<i>And the surrounding Kalahari Desert</i>
<i>is facing the worst drought in decades.</i>

55
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,760
<i>Thousands of animals</i>
<i>are fleeing the parched outer regions…</i>

56
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,280
<i>traveling for weeks.</i>

57
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,480
<i>All drawn here for one reason.</i>

58
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,760
<i>Water.</i>

59
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,600
<i>Rainwater that fell four months ago</i>

60
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,960
<i>in the Angolan Highlands to the north</i>

61
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,560
<i>has finally made its way down,</i>

62
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,880
<i>across the Kalahari</i>
<i>and into the flatlands of the Delta.</i>

63
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,680
<i>Over nine trillion liters</i>
<i>of fresh water</i>

64
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,200
<i>floods the vast desert…</i>

65
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,880
<i>creating</i>

66
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,240
<i>the greatest oasis on the planet.</i>

67
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,040
<i>In the flood's wake</i>
<i>come the great herds…</i>

68
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,000
<i>joining those who live here year-round.</i>

69
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,440
<i>Everyone has a role to play</i>

70
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,600
<i>in shaping and maintaining this land.</i>

71
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,120
<i>Even a six-month-old elephant</i>

72
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,320
<i>on her first visit.</i>

73
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,160
<i>She's never seen so much water…</i>

74
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,480
<i>…and food.</i>

75
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,120
<i>With endless floodplains</i>
<i>to munch their way through,</i>

76
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,280
<i>elephants become</i>
<i>the natural gardeners of the Delta…</i>

77
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,600
<i>uprooting far more than they can eat.</i>

78
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,080
<i>But over-pruning can clog the waterways,</i>

79
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,240
<i>halting the water's spread.</i>

80
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,560
<i>What the gardeners have blocked up,</i>

81
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,160
<i>families of hippos bulldoze through.</i>

82
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,680
<i>Not being swimmers,</i>
<i>they tiptoe along the bottom.</i>

83
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,760
<i>And in their wake,</i>
<i>leave hippo-sized highways…</i>

84
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,680
<i>that connect rivers to pools</i>
<i>and pools to floodplains…</i>

85
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,520
<i>allowing the water to keep flowing,</i>

86
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,000
<i>feeding the vibrant growth</i>
<i>of the entire Delta.</i>

87
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,440
<i>But the flood</i>
<i>isn't good news for all.</i>

88
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,520
<i>For the lioness,</i>

89
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,640
<i>it means a loss of hunting grounds.</i>

90
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,080
<i>And the old warrior king</i>
<i>is nowhere to be seen.</i>

91
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,640
<i>Whether he fled or was killed,</i>

92
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,240
<i>the young invaders</i>
<i>have usurped his throne.</i>

93
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,440
<i>Only lionesses of breeding age</i>
<i>are allowed to stay now.</i>

94
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,880
<i>And she's not one of them.</i>

95
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,640
<i>To these new males,</i>
<i>she's just an extra mouth to feed,</i>

96
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,320
<i>with little to contribute.</i>

97
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,960
<i>Banished and alone,</i>

98
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,680
<i>she'll need all her skill</i>
<i>just to stay alive.</i>

99
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,720
<i>The alpha female</i>
<i>has been housebound for weeks.</i>

100
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,560
<i>Because…</i>

101
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,240
<i>Well, who would leave this scruffy bunch?</i>

102
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,520
<i>At four weeks old,</i>
<i>her pups venture out for the first time.</i>

103
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,240
<i>All 14 of them.</i>

104
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,920
<i>Unable to hunt for herself,</i>
<i>she must rely on her pack</i>

105
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,880
<i>to bring the meat she needs</i>
<i>to keep her milk flowing.</i>

106
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,680
<i>But her stay-at-home work</i>
<i>is nonstop.</i>

107
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,480
<i>Sweeping out the den…</i>

108
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,160
<i>three weeks' worth of ticks and fleas…</i>

109
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,560
<i>landing right back where they started.</i>

110
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,640
<i>Her pack is on patrol…</i>

111
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,560
<i>without their leader.</i>

112
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,200
<i>And the floodwaters are slowing them down.</i>

113
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,320
<i>Lechwe.</i>

114
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,720
<i>Just one would feed the entire pack.</i>

115
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,080
<i>With splayed hooves</i>
<i>and powerful legs,</i>

116
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,880
<i>they can drive on through the flood.</i>

117
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,200
<i>Without the guidance of the alpha,</i>

118
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,200
<i>the pack follow them</i>
<i>into the deeper water.</i>

119
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,240
<i>It's futile.</i>

120
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,480
<i>And then…</i>

121
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,840
<i>a lone impala.</i>

122
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,360
<i>He lacks the paddle-like hooves</i>
<i>and long legs of the lechwe.</i>

123
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,560
<i>They finish the job quickly</i>
<i>to avoid a clash with competitors.</i>

124
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,120
<i>The pack often take out</i>
<i>the weak or injured in a group,</i>

125
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,560
<i>easier prey,</i>

126
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,000
<i>with the added benefit</i>
<i>of reducing disease in herds.</i>

127
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:14,280
<i>The hunters deliver their meals</i>
<i>in the safest way possible.</i>

128
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,480
<i>In their stomachs.</i>

129
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,400
<i>Until the pups can hunt themselves,</i>

130
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,080
<i>they eat first.</i>

131
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,840
<i>Generosity is</i>
<i>a core principle of their pack.</i>

132
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,440
<i>Though learning to share</i>
<i>doesn't come easily.</i>

133
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,720
<i>Retiring to the den</i>
<i>with your very first piece of meat</i>

134
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,880
<i>is about as good as it gets.</i>

135
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,200
<i>With water levels</i>
<i>at their highest,</i>

136
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,560
<i>the Okavango becomes a true paradise.</i>

137
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,000
<i>Aquatic life</i>
<i>from the surrounding rivers and swamps</i>

138
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,840
<i>spreads into the grassland to spawn.</i>

139
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,080
<i>Branches and trees</i>
<i>knocked down by elephants</i>

140
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,320
<i>create protected nurseries for young fish.</i>

141
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,880
<i>During peak flood,</i>

142
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,160
<i>the Delta swells</i>
<i>to twice its original size,</i>

143
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:39,600
<i>and anywhere high and dry</i>
<i>becomes prime real estate.</i>

144
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,520
<i>Water fig trees provide perfect nesting</i>

145
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,920
<i>for an astonishing variety</i>
<i>of fish-eating birds.</i>

146
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,520
<i>For these families,</i>
<i>it's not so much about where you build.</i>

147
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,480
<i>It's what you build.</i>

148
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,200
<i>Only the finest</i>
<i>construction materials will do.</i>

149
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,880
<i>If you can't find</i>
<i>the exact fabric you're looking for…</i>

150
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,320
<i>just steal it from your neighbor.</i>

151
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,960
<i>They can always steal it back again.</i>

152
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,400
<i>Finally,</i>

153
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,240
<i>a nest ready to hold</i>
<i>their most treasured possessions.</i>

154
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,480
<i>Gently turned…</i>

155
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,480
<i>and shaded from the scalding sun.</i>

156
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,280
<i>Eggshell? Snail shell?</i>

157
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,960
<i>He's a first-time dad.</i>

158
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,280
<i>Everyone is in a race to raise their young</i>

159
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,240
<i>before the floodwaters recede…</i>

160
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,880
<i>and the nests lose</i>
<i>their island protection.</i>

161
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,320
<i>The lioness</i>
<i>has been struggling to make a kill.</i>

162
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:47,240
<i>In drier conditions,</i>
<i>a reedbuck or lechwe would be a good bet.</i>

163
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,080
<i>But not in the flood,</i>

164
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,920
<i>not by herself.</i>

165
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,360
<i>And she's got competition.</i>

166
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,920
<i>Time to push back on her rivals.</i>

167
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,000
<i>It's pure intimidation.</i>

168
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,120
<i>She won't eat the carcass.</i>

169
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,680
<i>The pack would be wise</i>
<i>not to test her patience again.</i>

170
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,040
<i>By September,</i>
<i>the temperatures rise,</i>

171
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,120
<i>and water levels begin to drop,</i>

172
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,000
<i>leaving shrinking pools crowded with fish.</i>

173
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,640
<i>Perfect timing.</i>

174
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,280
<i>The adults get to work…</i>

175
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,120
<i>feeding their precious little monsters.</i>

176
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:12,160
<i>New pools form each day</i>
<i>as the flood recedes.</i>

177
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,800
<i>Everyone</i>
<i>has their own special technique</i>

178
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,080
<i>to go with their own special bill.</i>

179
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,480
<i>Pelicans favor the fishing net.</i>

180
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,200
<i>Pied kingfishers…</i>

181
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,960
<i>use the dive-bombing system.</i>

182
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:56,560
<i>Openbill storks</i>
<i>have snail-plucking down to a science.</i>

183
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,200
<i>And the rather theatrical black egret</i>

184
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:14,360
<i>uses its cape to mimic shady spots</i>
<i>where fish like to hide.</i>

185
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,920
<i>Bravo.</i>

186
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,760
<i>Different approaches with one purpose.</i>

187
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,960
<i>To build up</i>
<i>their chicks' strength</i>

188
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,320
<i>as quickly as possible.</i>

189
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,560
<i>Pelican chicks</i>
<i>are the greediest.</i>

190
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,000
<i>They need up to 30 feeds a day.</i>

191
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,120
<i>The tireless adults all know</i>

192
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,560
<i>the golden rule</i>
<i>of family life in the Delta.</i>

193
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:43,400
<i>The stronger your young,</i>
<i>the greater their chances of survival.</i>

194
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,200
<i>As the floodwaters recede</i>

195
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,280
<i>and the desert heat builds,</i>

196
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,240
<i>hunting grounds dry out…</i>

197
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,520
<i>…shifting the balance of power</i>
<i>back to the predators.</i>

198
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,840
<i>But alone, the lioness' kill rate</i>
<i>is still dangerously low.</i>

199
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,400
<i>She's growing weaker</i>
<i>by the day.</i>

200
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,000
<i>To complicate matters,</i>

201
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,720
<i>she's come into season.</i>

202
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,120
<i>Her scent will carry</i>
<i>to any lions in the area.</i>

203
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,440
<i>Including those she most wants to avoid.</i>

204
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,680
<i>The young males</i>
<i>who destroyed her family.</i>

205
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,440
<i>But with</i>
<i>the hunting grounds opening up,</i>

206
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:37,880
<i>another even bigger male</i>
<i>is drawn to the area.</i>

207
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,760
<i>His dark mane and deep call</i>

208
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,200
<i>are signs he's in his prime.</i>

209
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,960
<i>It's risky.</i>

210
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,760
<i>But if they join forces,</i>

211
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,640
<i>he could offer protection</i>
<i>and hunting support.</i>

212
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,440
<i>Her newfound alliance</i>
<i>is short-lived.</i>

213
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,480
<i>The stranger moves on</i>
<i>after only a few days.</i>

214
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,280
<i>Alone, once more,</i>

215
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,160
<i>but this time pregnant.</i>

216
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,480
<i>She won't be hunting</i>
<i>for just herself anymore.</i>

217
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,120
<i>Every family in the Delta</i>

218
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:50,160
<i>is intimately connected</i>
<i>to the rhythms of the changing seasons.</i>

219
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,960
<i>The water levels are plummeting,</i>

220
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,360
<i>turning to mud.</i>

221
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,880
<i>Fun for a calf…</i>

222
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,480
<i>…but it's a sign her herd should move on.</i>

223
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,240
<i>With the dry season</i>
<i>taking grip,</i>

224
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,800
<i>the herds need to make the most</i>
<i>of whatever grazing is left.</i>

225
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,320
<i>She learns from watching.</i>

226
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,960
<i>But some things, she has yet to perfect.</i>

227
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:01,720
<i>Such as paying attention,</i>
<i>so as not to get left behind.</i>

228
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,600
<i>She's being taken to a special place.</i>

229
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,000
<i>A stand of fan palms.</i>

230
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,200
<i>They thrive</i>
<i>where salts have been left behind</i>

231
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,880
<i>by the evaporating flood.</i>

232
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,800
<i>And the fruits that sit at the top</i>

233
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,200
<i>are revered by elephants.</i>

234
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,640
<i>Harvesting such lofty treats</i>

235
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,840
<i>is a trick</i>
<i>that only a four-ton bull can pull off.</i>

236
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:22,160
<i>Each shake</i>
<i>releases hundreds of fruits at once.</i>

237
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,040
<i>He knocks down</i>
<i>enough for everyone.</i>

238
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,680
<i>This precious meal</i>

239
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,800
<i>is not just for this family</i>
<i>and not just for today.</i>

240
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,200
<i>Elephants are the chief distributors</i>

241
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,120
<i>of fan palm seeds.</i>

242
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:11,040
<i>-The calf's ancestors left this fruit.</i>

243
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:17,320
<i>And now</i>
<i>she will do the same for those to come.</i>

244
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,880
<i>The herd will carry the seeds</i>
<i>for many miles.</i>

245
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:32,400
<i>Wherever they release them</i>
<i>in their dung, they can take root.</i>

246
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,720
<i>Just another</i>
<i>of the herd's vital contributions</i>

247
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,840
<i>to the Delta.</i>

248
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,520
<i>It will be</i>
<i>their last decent meal.</i>

249
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,880
<i>From here on,</i>

250
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:02,400
<i>the increasing scarcity of food and water</i>
<i>will drive their every move.</i>

251
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,560
<i>The painted wolves</i>
<i>have made it through the flood,</i>

252
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,040
<i>but not entirely intact.</i>

253
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,040
<i>One team member already killed,</i>

254
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,880
<i>and now the best hunters</i>
<i>have deserted the alpha and her pups.</i>

255
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,920
<i>Too many new mouths to feed</i>

256
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,720
<i>and not enough food to go around.</i>

257
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:00,320
<i>It's time for the rookies</i>
<i>to move out of the den</i>

258
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,160
<i>and begin searching for food.</i>

259
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,080
<i> The pups'</i>
<i>first great adventure.</i>

260
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,760
<i>Their first patrol with the grown-ups.</i>

261
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,280
<i>Though, they are more</i>
<i>of a hindrance than a help.</i>

262
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:41,240
<i>Their little legs will carry them</i>
<i>up to 15 kilometers a day.</i>

263
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,840
<i>The alpha must rebuild her team</i>
<i>into a peak hunting machine…</i>

264
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,840
<i>and teach her pups</i>
<i>the ways of the pack hunter.</i>

265
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,080
<i> The receding floodwaters</i>

266
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:33,200
<i>have created perfect conditions</i>
<i>to unleash a plague.</i>

267
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,600
<i>Locusts.</i>

268
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:42,240
<i>The building heat</i>
<i>triggers a mass hatching.</i>

269
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,640
<i>Ten million greedy mouths</i>
<i>devour the drying vegetation.</i>

270
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:07,280
<i>Ancient termite mounds</i>
<i>seem to be the only things impervious</i>

271
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:10,800
<i>to the great forces</i>
<i>now at play in the Delta.</i>

272
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,320
<i>It's October.</i>

273
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,440
<i>In two short months,</i>

274
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:43,040
<i>the drought has transformed</i>
<i>a verdant paradise</i>

275
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,080
<i>into a barren dust bowl.</i>

276
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:56,080
<i>All the herds are searching for water</i>

277
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,800
<i>wherever they can find it.</i>

278
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:26,560
<i>They are easy pickings</i>
<i>for the two young males.</i>

279
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,840
<i>Who grow bigger and stronger every day.</i>

280
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,720
<i>They follow</i>
<i>the buffaloes' every move.</i>

281
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,440
<i>Tracking the same herds,</i>

282
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,080
<i>the lioness must stay</i>
<i>a safe distance from the males.</i>

283
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:11,480
<i>In her delicate state,</i>
<i>she desperately needs to eat.</i>

284
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:23,400
<i>But taking on prey</i>
<i>the size of a buffalo all by herself</i>

285
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,680
<i>is next to impossible.</i>

286
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:42,440
<i>At best, she can pick up</i>
<i>scraps left by the males,</i>

287
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,640
<i>scavenging the bare minimum</i>
<i>she needs to stay alive.</i>

288
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,520
<i>All the herds</i>
<i>and their predators</i>

289
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,720
<i>are being drawn in by the drought,</i>

290
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,640
<i>coming together in the heart of the Delta,</i>

291
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,280
<i>where the last water sources remain.</i>

292
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,240
<i>The calf and her herd</i>

293
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:35,360
<i>have to travel further</i>
<i>with each passing day.</i>

294
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:50,720
<i> Their eyesight may be poor,</i>
<i>but with highly attuned hearing and smell,</i>

295
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,600
<i>elephants can sense danger</i>
<i>from miles away.</i>

296
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,440
<i> Nile crocodiles.</i>

297
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:13,840
<i>Some up to six meters long,</i>
<i>weighing three-quarters of a ton.</i>

298
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:23,200
<i>But most are pretty small,</i>
<i>only a meter or so.</i>

299
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,360
<i>The older elephants</i>
<i>show the calf how to get to the water</i>

300
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:59,960
<i>by navigating</i>
<i>this strange obstacle course.</i>

301
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,280
<i>At last.</i>

302
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:37,080
<i>And if you still haven't mastered</i>
<i>the art of the trunk,</i>

303
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,480
<i>face drinking is always a good fallback.</i>

304
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,560
<i>The calf is learning…</i>

305
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,560
<i>the hard way.</i>

306
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:00,120
<i>This water hole is the herd's savior.</i>

307
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,720
<i>Elephants also use it</i>
<i>to protect their skin from the sun.</i>

308
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:22,880
<i>The mud cools</i>
<i>their overheated bodies as it evaporates.</i>

309
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:35,400
<i>And the dust settles</i>
<i>in the cracks and crevices of their skin,</i>

310
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:36,880
<i>acting as sunblock.</i>

311
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:55,200
<i>A spot like this is highly sought-after.</i>

312
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:11,440
<i>But the herd aren't ready</i>
<i>to move on from their mud spa just yet.</i>

313
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,160
<i>Such difficult times</i>
<i>teach the growing pups many things.</i>

314
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:40,600
<i>Harassing a well-fed vulture</i>
<i>must be a good lesson in… something.</i>

315
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,080
<i>A lone hyena…</i>

316
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,840
<i>makes for a more serious education.</i>

317
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:10,400
<i>Testing their stress levels</i>
<i>helps prepare them</i>

318
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,280
<i>for future confrontations</i>
<i>with competitors.</i>

319
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:29,440
<i>But they still need</i>
<i>to learn the most important lesson.</i>

320
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:36,960
<i>The art…</i>

321
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,600
<i>of the hunt.</i>

322
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,040
<i>With the alpha</i>
<i>now back in charge…</i>

323
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,960
<i>she directs the team</i>
<i>to drive their prey into the thick mud</i>

324
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,840
<i>to slow them down.</i>

325
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:39,120
<i>Her coaching is paying off.</i>

326
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:55,080
<i>They're learning who to target…</i>

327
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,120
<i>and who to leave.</i>

328
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:11,400
<i>The pack is growing</i>
<i>wiser and closer each day.</i>

329
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:28,960
<i>By late October, temperatures</i>
<i>have soared to 45 degrees Celsius.</i>

330
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,920
<i>Not a drop has fallen.</i>

331
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:38,400
<i>In recent years, the dry seasons here</i>
<i>have been getting longer,</i>

332
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,200
<i>the heat more severe.</i>

333
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:50,600
<i>This year is fast becoming</i>
<i>the drought of the century.</i>

334
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,640
<i>Every day becomes a gamble</i>

335
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:04,400
<i>to find enough water</i>
<i>to keep the whole herd alive.</i>

336
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:14,680
<i>The calf and her mother</i>
<i>need it the most.</i>

337
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,400
<i>She's a prisoner in these lands</i>

338
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:28,920
<i>that only a few months ago</i>
<i>offered her so much.</i>

339
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,680
<i>Her survival</i>
<i>is entirely in the hands</i>

340
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,480
<i>of the wise, old leader.</i>

341
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:47,760
<i>The herd's matriarch.</i>

342
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,000
<i>She's been traveling these pathways</i>

343
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,240
<i>since she, too, was a young calf.</i>

344
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:10,200
<i>Her brain, infused with memories,</i>

345
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,200
<i>holds an ancient internal map</i>

346
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,920
<i>of where the last pockets</i>
<i>of water might be found.</i>

347
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:28,040
<i>Family is</i>
<i>more than just the herd.</i>

348
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,560
<i>Family is memory…</i>

349
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,400
<i>and that's what's making the difference</i>

350
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:37,680
<i>between life and death.</i>

351
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,920
<i>The old family knowledge</i>
<i>leads them</i>

352
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,120
<i>to one of the last remaining water holes</i>

353
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,840
<i>in the entire Delta.</i>

354
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,840
<i>Every muddy drop</i>
<i>is a lifesaver.</i>

355
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:37,400
<i>But their little one</i>
<i>can't get to the water.</i>

356
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,840
<i>So she simply gets</i>
<i>into the water.</i>

357
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,640
<i>Getting out, not so easy.</i>

358
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:39,600
<i>For a clumsy calf,</i>
<i>a loving family is her most powerful ally.</i>

359
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,960
<i>There's no time to waste.</i>

360
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,800
<i>They need more water,</i>

361
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,480
<i>and they'll chase</i>
<i>the storm front to find it.</i>

362
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:16,920
<i>-Finally, clouds begin to form.</i>

363
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,920
<i>Giant storm cells.</i>

364
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:47,760
<i> Elephants are able to hear</i>
<i>the low frequencies of distant thunder</i>

365
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:51,880
<i>and detect storms</i>
<i>up to 200 kilometers away.</i>

366
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:19,160
<i>But in a region that's gone</i>
<i>seven months with barely a drop of rain,</i>

367
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:23,720
<i>the tinder-dry grasses are a ticking bomb.</i>

368
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:34,080
<i>The adults in the herd</i>
<i>have seen fire before.</i>

369
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:40,160
<i>Each year, up to 4,000 square kilometers</i>
<i>of the Delta burns.</i>

370
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:47,600
<i>They know to stick close together</i>
<i>as they try to navigate the flames.</i>

371
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:13,440
<i>The fires are devastating…</i>

372
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,120
<i>…but don't devour everything.</i>

373
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:35,520
<i> The grazers have thinned</i>
<i>the amount of fuel available to burn.</i>

374
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:40,800
<i>And the scorched areas</i>
<i>will create new pathways</i>

375
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:43,120
<i>for next year's flood to access.</i>

376
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:50,080
<i>The Delta has always found a way to heal</i>

377
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:54,280
<i>because its residents</i>
<i>never stop playing their part.</i>

378
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:08,400
<i>At last, the skies yield.</i>

379
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:14,640
<i>The greatest drought in living memory</i>

380
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,200
<i>is finally broken.</i>

381
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,560
<i>Over the next five months,</i>

382
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:30,240
<i>half a meter of rain will fall here.</i>

383
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:35,600
<i>Any ground scorched by the fire</i>

384
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,600
<i>will be revitalized.</i>

385
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:06,520
<i>The herds are released</i>
<i>from their water holes.</i>

386
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:14,600
<i>-And the predators spread out.</i>

387
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,320
<i>Keeping the grazers</i>
<i>on the move,</i>

388
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,840
<i>giving the new shoots a chance,</i>

389
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:31,000
<i>and preventing any one area</i>
<i>from becoming depleted.</i>

390
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:38,320
<i>Balance…</i>

391
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,080
<i>is maintained.</i>

392
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:58,320
<i>And with the arrival</i>
<i>of the rains…</i>

393
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,800
<i>come four new cubs.</i>

394
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:09,560
<i>The flush of green</i>
<i>has prompted a baby boom.</i>

395
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,720
<i>She moves her cubs</i>
<i>every few days…</i>

396
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:47,280
<i>to prevent their scent</i>
<i>from attracting enemies.</i>

397
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:14,320
<i>But her latest move</i>
<i>hasn't gone unnoticed.</i>

398
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:24,560
<i>The young males</i>
<i>have picked up their trail.</i>

399
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:46,520
<i>They will not tolerate</i>
<i>the presence of another male's cubs.</i>

400
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:05,080
<i>She's half their size</i>
<i>and outnumbered.</i>

401
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:50,280
<i>They're trapped.</i>

402
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:04,400
<i>Her instinct</i>
<i>is to lead her babies to safety.</i>

403
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:21,680
<i>But the cubs have no idea</i>
<i>who they're up against.</i>

404
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:56,480
<i>She's lost track of a cub.</i>

405
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:38,040
<i>She'll fight</i>
<i>to the death for her family…</i>

406
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:47,160
<i>…but the males won't risk further injury.</i>

407
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:12,640
<i>Thanks</i>
<i>to their mother's bravery,</i>

408
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:15,120
<i>three of her cubs have survived.</i>

409
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:25,080
<i>She can't rest for long.</i>

410
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:29,240
<i>She's all they've got.</i>

411
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:55,640
<i>For the painted wolves,</i>
<i>life again is sweet.</i>

412
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:04,800
<i>Their mother has risen</i>

413
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:07,800
<i>to the greatest challenge</i>
<i>she's ever faced.</i>

414
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:12,960
<i>Bringing a pack cut to half its size</i>

415
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:15,040
<i>through the perils of the drought</i>

416
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:18,960
<i>and transforming</i>
<i>a hapless bunch of rookies</i>

417
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:22,520
<i>into a hardworking, successful team.</i>

418
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,960
<i>Their comeback is complete.</i>

419
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,000
<i>The gutsy little calf</i>

420
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:49,080
<i>has chalked up</i>
<i>her first year in the Delta…</i>

421
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:55,000
<i>and she herself</i>
<i>has contributed to its upkeep…</i>

422
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:59,200
<i>with every reed she's trampled,</i>

423
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:01,960
<i>every palm seed she's left.</i>

424
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:07,080
<i>If she can survive</i>
<i>another 30 or 40 more years</i>

425
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:09,240
<i>of increasing extremes,</i>

426
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:14,000
<i>fires, floods, and famines…</i>

427
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:19,920
<i>…she will finally become a matriarch</i>

428
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:23,520
<i>and pass on everything she's learned</i>

429
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:25,760
<i>to the next generation.</i>

430
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:38,120
<i>Now, four months old,</i>

431
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:41,200
<i>the lioness's cubs are getting stronger</i>

432
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:43,240
<i>and more able every day.</i>

433
01:14:56,320 --> 01:15:00,120
<i>Single-handedly,</i>
<i>she's kept them all well-fed.</i>

434
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:24,400
<i>Their games</i>
<i>are practice for real life.</i>

435
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:27,480
<i>To teach them</i>
<i>how to catch prey like their mother.</i>

436
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:56,120
<i>She once lost</i>
<i>what was most precious to her.</i>

437
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:06,080
<i>But now,</i>
<i>has a little pride to call her own.</i>

438
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:12,080
<i>Her cubs will soon learn</i>
<i>the vital importance of family.</i>

439
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:19,800
<i>Just one of a myriad of families</i>
<i>whose presence sustains their land.</i>

440
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:26,160
<i>These animals</i>
<i>will continue to adapt</i>

441
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:28,400
<i>as best they can…</i>

442
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,400
<i>to the growing threats they face.</i>

443
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:38,440
<i>The world's climate changing…</i>

444
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:43,400
<i>becoming increasingly hostile,</i>

445
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:44,880
<i>more extreme.</i>

446
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:54,280
<i>Their greatest weapon</i>
<i>in their fight to survive is each other.</i>

447
01:16:55,920 --> 01:17:00,800
<i>For their fates are bound together</i>
<i>with this great wilderness.</i>

448
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:05,080
<i>The magnificent,</i>

449
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:07,320
<i>ever-changing</i>

450
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:10,320
<i>Okavango Delta.</i>
