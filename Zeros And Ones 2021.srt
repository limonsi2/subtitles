3
00:01:17,468 --> 00:01:18,904
about the new film
I'm working on

4
00:01:18,948 --> 00:01:21,777
called Zeros and Ones,
by Abel Ferrara.

5
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:25,694
I've been a fan of Abel
since I first fell in love
with the movies.

6
00:01:25,737 --> 00:01:28,914
He's a completely unique
and extraordinary filmmaker.

7
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:33,223
He's got voice with the camera.
He has depth with his actors.

8
00:01:33,267 --> 00:01:37,880
The work that he's done
most recently with Willem Dafoe
has been wildly inspiring to me,

9
00:01:37,923 --> 00:01:40,274
so I was very grateful
to get the script.

10
00:01:40,317 --> 00:01:44,756
Especially considering
that the script
speaks to this moment.

11
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,151
Not in any obvious,
uh, didactic way,

12
00:01:48,195 --> 00:01:52,155
but you can feel
that this is Abel's hit

13
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:55,898
on what we've all been going
through for the last year or so.

14
00:01:55,941 --> 00:02:00,163
Uh, it's a beautiful script.
I play a military man.

15
00:02:00,207 --> 00:02:03,427
You're not exactly sure whether
I'm a good guy or a bad guy,

16
00:02:03,471 --> 00:02:06,517
and I also play my own brother,
who's a revolutionary.

17
00:02:06,561 --> 00:02:09,912
And so, that's very dynamic
for me to get to play

18
00:02:09,955 --> 00:02:13,394
these two characters
that are representing
contrasting viewpoints.

19
00:02:13,437 --> 00:02:15,657
I think we're gonna be able
to do something really special.

20
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,269
Uh, I consider the most
important aspect of my job,

21
00:02:19,313 --> 00:02:21,837
who I choose to work with,
that's what actors do.

22
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,058
You know,
we champion filmmakers,
uh, we champion voices.

23
00:02:26,102 --> 00:02:29,584
And I'm excited for the world
to see Abel's response

24
00:02:29,627 --> 00:02:32,935
to-to this wild year
we've been living through.

25
00:02:32,978 --> 00:02:34,415
I hope you enjoy it.

Yo, you good?

40
00:09:28,742 --> 00:09:30,178
Still here.

41
00:09:44,975 --> 00:09:46,847
All right, here,
let me pull it up.

42
00:11:16,414 --> 00:11:18,939
Hey, let me-- let me
work with this some more.

46

You're still alive.

47
00:12:30,837 --> 00:12:32,229
You trust it?

48
00:12:32,273 --> 00:12:33,796
[soft chuckle]
Come on.

[intense snare drum beat]

54
00:13:33,943 --> 00:13:36,554
[man, voice-over] It is
to religion that we call you.

55
00:13:37,729 --> 00:13:39,862
The religion of sincerity.

56
00:13:39,906 --> 00:13:42,604
The best manners,
righteousness,

57
00:13:42,647 --> 00:13:45,563
mercy, honor, purity, piety.

58
00:13:48,305 --> 00:13:52,309
It is the religion
of showing kindness to others.

59
00:13:52,353 --> 00:13:54,659
Establishing justice
between them,

60
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:58,011
granting them the rights,

61
00:13:58,054 --> 00:14:01,362
and defending the oppressed
and the persecuted.

62
00:14:05,714 --> 00:14:10,414
We call you to be a people
of principles,
honor, and purity.

63
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:15,855
That you may be
freed from the deceptive lies,
that you are a great nation.

64
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:25,690
Do you now know why we fight
and why we shall be victorious?

65
00:14:56,286 --> 00:14:59,159
Hey, shoot it
so they believe it.

66
00:15:26,534 --> 00:15:28,579
[JJ, voice-over]
Symbol of Christianity...

67

[intense snare drum beat]

69
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:47,511
The 3,000-year war...

70
00:16:04,398 --> 00:16:06,966
Jesus was just another soldier,

71
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,012
another war casualty...

72
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:17,846
but on whose side?

73
00:16:58,408 --> 00:16:59,844
[doorbell buzzes]

74
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,640
Hey.

75
00:17:14,772 --> 00:17:16,339
Come up the back.

76
00:17:21,692 --> 00:17:24,826
[footsteps approaching]

77
00:18:00,557 --> 00:18:02,081

[child crying]

83
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:49,362
His father?

84
00:19:54,671 --> 00:19:56,195
Your brother...

85
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,023
is still in prison.

86
00:20:02,984 --> 00:20:04,594
Well, at least he's alive.

87
00:20:05,421 --> 00:20:06,901
[Valeria] For now.

88
00:20:08,337 --> 00:20:09,773
Are you sure?

89
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,733
[Valeria] You tell me.

90
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:17,738
[scoffs]

91
00:20:26,747 --> 00:20:28,183
Is that your rabbit?

92
00:20:30,316 --> 00:20:31,665
Does he have a name?

93
00:20:37,845 --> 00:20:39,368
What are you dreamin' about?

94
00:20:41,631 --> 00:20:42,850
Fish?

95
00:20:46,462 --> 00:20:47,681
Porcupines?

96
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,081
[whispers]
Goodnight.

97
00:21:14,011 --> 00:21:15,622
I only have tea.

98
00:21:15,665 --> 00:21:16,710
That's fine.

99
00:21:18,538 --> 00:21:20,279
[tea pouring]

100
00:21:38,427 --> 00:21:41,212
Have you figured out
what you're doing in my country?

101
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,436
I'm workin' on it.

102
00:21:52,876 --> 00:21:54,138
Lots of honey?

103
00:21:54,182 --> 00:21:55,792
- [JJ] Mm-hm.
- Right.

104
00:21:58,186 --> 00:22:00,536
What's with you
Americans and honey?

105
00:22:24,081 --> 00:22:26,867
You don't care
if he ever gets out.

106
00:22:28,521 --> 00:22:31,045
[sighs]

107
00:22:31,088 --> 00:22:34,004
He won't last
ten minutes on the street,

108
00:22:34,048 --> 00:22:35,658
knowin' what he knows.

109
00:22:39,662 --> 00:22:41,447
How do they know what he knows?

110
00:22:42,622 --> 00:22:44,058
You told them?

111
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:49,759
[JJ breathes deeply]

112
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:04,339
[footsteps]

113
00:23:13,174 --> 00:23:15,785
[phone ringing]

114
00:23:20,703 --> 00:23:22,226
[woman over phone]
I heard you're back.

115
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,885
Show him.

116
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,421
And they're both negative.

117
00:23:54,563 --> 00:23:56,652
[bus engine revving]

118
00:24:27,117 --> 00:24:28,554

[snapping fingers]

123
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,365
He's addicted to the screens.

124
00:28:13,343 --> 00:28:19,480
In another time and place,
it could be castor oil,

125
00:28:19,523 --> 00:28:22,309
and I'd call you partigiano.

126
00:28:27,096 --> 00:28:28,445
Made in Swiss...

127
00:28:30,143 --> 00:28:32,623
made popular in San Francisco,

128
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:36,976
and perfected recently by a chef
not far from here.

129
00:28:38,673 --> 00:28:41,589
It's quicker and more effective.

130
00:28:42,546 --> 00:28:43,504
[Justin] Ah, shit.

131
00:28:43,547 --> 00:28:45,288
No-- you don't...

132
00:29:00,956 --> 00:29:03,002
[gasping for air]

133
00:29:03,045 --> 00:29:05,134
[Luciano] Shh... Shh...

134
00:29:07,963 --> 00:29:09,138
Where?

135
00:29:12,838 --> 00:29:15,318
Where... and when?

136
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:16,929
Okay?

137
00:29:18,887 --> 00:29:21,760
It takes more than guns
to kill a man.

138
00:29:23,065 --> 00:29:25,807
You think I'm your enemy?

139
00:29:25,851 --> 00:29:28,331
Yeah, is that what you think?

140
00:29:31,726 --> 00:29:36,818
Your fear made me,
and now, here I am.

141
00:29:38,602 --> 00:29:43,999
I am your enemy, but your enemy
won't be gone when you kill me.

142
00:29:45,696 --> 00:29:47,220
You can't kill me.

143
00:29:48,874 --> 00:29:53,226
Try it, watch what happens.

144
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:57,534
I'll be right back
after the sound and the fury
is finished.

145
00:29:57,578 --> 00:30:00,015
Where, and when?

146
00:30:01,321 --> 00:30:02,626
Come on.

147
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:07,414
[Justin]
This machine kills fascists.

148
00:30:07,457 --> 00:30:11,200
This machine is my voice.
It's the human voice.

149
00:30:11,244 --> 00:30:14,856
My heart is the drummer--
Okay, all right.

150
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:18,207
You wanna know-- you wanna know
where the door is, eh?

151
00:30:18,251 --> 00:30:19,905
[Lucian] Where, and when?

152
00:30:19,948 --> 00:30:21,471
[Justin sniffs, laughs]

153
00:30:21,515 --> 00:30:22,995
No, wait, wait.

154
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:24,213
I'll tell you--

155
00:30:24,257 --> 00:30:25,780
I'll tell you--
I'll tell you--

156
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:26,955
I'll tell you where the--
where the door--

157
00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:29,262
I'll meet you--
I'll meet you there.

158
00:30:31,046 --> 00:30:33,527
And I'm not afraid to die.

159
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:34,745
And you?

160
00:30:36,008 --> 00:30:37,270
You're dead already.

161
00:30:38,924 --> 00:30:42,275
I would light myself on fire!

162
00:30:42,318 --> 00:30:47,454
How come no one
is lighting themselves
on fire, eh?!

163
00:30:47,497 --> 00:30:53,460
How come no one is
lighting themselves
on fire anymore?!

164
00:30:53,503 --> 00:30:56,115
This country
was conceived in liberty,

165
00:30:56,158 --> 00:31:01,816
dedicated to the proposition
that all men are created equal.

166
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,863
This is a battleground.

167
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:07,953
The world is watching
what happens here,

168
00:31:07,996 --> 00:31:12,653
and it is up to us,
the living...

169
00:31:12,696 --> 00:31:15,395
to finish the work of the dead

170
00:31:15,438 --> 00:31:18,137
so they will
not have died in vain

171
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,922
and that a government
of the people, for the people,

172
00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:24,099
by the people, shall not perish
from this earth!

173
00:31:24,143 --> 00:31:28,408
Hail Caesar!
Hail Augustus Caesar
'cause he-he got it, he got it.

174
00:31:28,451 --> 00:31:30,453
And you-you, are you American?
You're American, right?

175
00:31:30,497 --> 00:31:32,629
I can't see him,
behind his mask!

176
00:31:32,673 --> 00:31:33,848
Are you American?

177
00:31:45,033 --> 00:31:47,383
You know the song!

178
00:31:48,515 --> 00:31:49,820
Are you American?

179
00:32:02,746 --> 00:32:07,229
[whispering]
It's the law of nature,
nature's God.

180
00:32:07,273 --> 00:32:09,579
We hold these truths
to be self-evident

181
00:32:09,623 --> 00:32:11,886
that all men are created equal
and that they are endowed

182
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,193
with certain unalienable rights:

183
00:32:14,236 --> 00:32:17,065
Life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness.

Who knows who said it,
raise their hand.

186
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:28,990
It wasn't one man,
yet you wanna kill one man.

When you were
rifling through my bag?

191
00:32:39,566 --> 00:32:42,090

come up with that idea, huh?

193

Are you guys Boy Scouts?
Do you swear to be
faithful and true, huh?

Huh? Don't you even know
that your strippers are Marxist?

196

Your shoemakers are my soldiers?

197
00:33:03,764 --> 00:33:08,464
That your cameraman
is my brother, huh?

198
00:33:08,508 --> 00:33:12,947
Nobody living's ever going to
stop me from walking
the freedom highway.

199
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:16,907
Nobody living's gonna
make me turn back

200

'cause this land
was made for you and me.

201

You don't know
how to work with wood.

You don't love it, huh?

that's why you hate me--

So when is this gonna happen?

214
00:35:40,964 --> 00:35:43,532
It has been happening
for a thousand years.

215
00:35:46,187 --> 00:35:48,407
[JJ] Is he here now?

216
00:35:51,279 --> 00:35:52,976
He was born here.

217
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:05,598
Do you remember how you felt
when you first
put on that uniform?

218
00:36:11,081 --> 00:36:12,518
I felt useful.

219
00:36:16,739 --> 00:36:20,439

Oh, my American friend.

You tell me.

01:08:34,284 --> 01:08:36,764
[laughing continues]

361
01:08:36,808 --> 01:08:43,728
Listen, soldier,
convening with the enemy
is a serious offense.

362
01:08:45,033 --> 01:08:46,818
Can you understand that?

363
01:08:53,738 --> 01:08:55,392
When?

364
01:08:55,435 --> 01:08:56,480
When?

365
01:09:04,183 --> 01:09:06,925
[Phil] Did you plan on
keeping this to yourself?

366
01:09:31,776 --> 01:09:33,734
Have you talked to Steven?

367
01:09:35,214 --> 01:09:37,042
You just got him killed.

368
01:09:44,963 --> 01:09:46,486
[JJ] Where's my brother?

369
01:09:50,055 --> 01:09:51,970
Your brother was an anarchist.

370
01:09:53,928 --> 01:09:56,757
Your brother was a communist.

371
01:09:57,976 --> 01:10:00,196
[laughing]

372
01:10:06,027 --> 01:10:08,204
My brother
was a revolutionary.

373
01:10:15,994 --> 01:10:18,736
- We gotta get out of here.
- Where?

374
01:10:20,477 --> 01:10:22,043
New York?

375
01:10:56,643 --> 01:10:58,036
Shit.

376
01:11:03,737 --> 01:11:08,525
[stairs clanking]

377
01:11:08,568 --> 01:11:11,658
[intense music playing]

378
01:11:22,669 --> 01:11:23,801
When?

379
01:11:26,499 --> 01:11:27,892
Right now.

380
01:11:30,155 --> 01:11:31,548
Get the baby.

381
01:12:10,587 --> 01:12:11,849
It's on.

382
01:12:13,459 --> 01:12:15,156
Thank God.

383
01:12:49,930 --> 01:12:52,411
[intense drum beat playing]

384
01:13:07,905 --> 01:13:09,907
[indistinct shouting]

385
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:48,989
[birds squawking]

386
01:15:14,901 --> 01:15:17,817
[vehicle approaching]

387
01:15:25,172 --> 01:15:27,784
[peaceful guitar music playing]

388
01:16:23,491 --> 01:16:25,624
[children playing]

389
01:16:25,668 --> 01:16:29,019
[peaceful music continues]

390
01:16:41,466 --> 01:16:43,511
[no audible dialogue]

391
01:18:26,179 --> 01:18:29,226
Well, the movie's over.

392
01:18:30,531 --> 01:18:35,449
Uh, when I first
spoke to you, um,

393
01:18:35,493 --> 01:18:37,538
I was really
just recording a video

394
01:18:37,582 --> 01:18:40,150
to help raise money
to make the movie.

395
01:18:40,193 --> 01:18:44,067
And now, uh,
we've made the film!

396
01:18:44,110 --> 01:18:48,332
And I just watched it,
and you just watched it.

397
01:19:06,785 --> 01:19:09,962
When Abel gave me the script
and, uh--

398
01:19:10,006 --> 01:19:16,447
script is a really, uh,
not accurate term
for what he sent.

399
01:19:18,405 --> 01:19:20,494
I really didn't understand
a word of it...

400
01:19:20,538 --> 01:19:22,148
Yeah.

401
01:19:22,192 --> 01:19:24,934
But I really liked it.
[soft chuckle]

402
01:19:24,977 --> 01:19:29,808
Uh, I did, but I didn't know
what was happening.

403
01:19:29,852 --> 01:19:33,420
I felt like somebody
was up to something,

404
01:19:33,464 --> 01:19:35,509
and that I wanted to be
a part of it,

405
01:19:35,553 --> 01:19:37,990
but I didn't know
what he was trying to say.

406
01:19:42,299 --> 01:19:45,781
And now,
after watching the film,

407
01:19:45,824 --> 01:19:51,787
I think what I began to feel
while we're making it is true.

408
01:19:51,830 --> 01:19:53,614
Which is that you're--

409
01:19:53,658 --> 01:20:00,143
You can have kind of two
opposing outlooks on the world

410
01:20:00,186 --> 01:20:02,841
and that they're both accurate.

411
01:20:02,885 --> 01:20:05,409
You kind of can
align your shoulders one way

412
01:20:05,452 --> 01:20:08,455
in which you realize you wake up
in the morning and you think,

413
01:20:09,543 --> 01:20:12,633
"Oh, shit, I'm gonna die.

414
01:20:12,677 --> 01:20:16,028
I mean, this is real.
I'm gonna die."

415
01:20:16,072 --> 01:20:19,162
And the world is run

416
01:20:19,205 --> 01:20:24,863
by corrupt, greedy individuals

417
01:20:24,907 --> 01:20:29,302
and there's great tragedy
and disease

418
01:20:29,346 --> 01:20:32,479
and the planet is eroding.

419
01:20:32,523 --> 01:20:36,788
And not only am I gonna die,
everybody I know is gonna die.

420
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:40,487
And brothers lie to each other,
and people hurt each other.

421
01:20:40,531 --> 01:20:46,624
And you just-- you just
don't know if you can go on,
or what the point of it all is.

422
01:20:46,667 --> 01:20:51,977
And then almost
with-with the same ease,

423
01:20:52,021 --> 01:20:56,199
you can align your shoulders
a different direction and go,

424
01:20:56,242 --> 01:21:02,074
"I was born! Why was I born?
I'm so glad I was born.

425
01:21:02,118 --> 01:21:07,253
Everybody was born,
and the sun comes up
and there're flowers.

426
01:21:07,297 --> 01:21:10,735
And guess what,
a lot of people
are really nice!"

427
01:21:10,778 --> 01:21:13,912
And there's a kind of
pervasive kindness and healing

428
01:21:13,956 --> 01:21:19,570
that runs through the world
as it spins away.

429
01:21:19,613 --> 01:21:22,834
And there's all this
tremendous beauty!

430
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:26,577
Every child is a miracle

431
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:29,972
and I wonder why I was born,
you know.

432
01:21:30,015 --> 01:21:31,582
What I'm doing.

433
01:21:31,625 --> 01:21:36,413
Both those outlooks
are a hundred percent true.

434
01:21:48,425 --> 01:21:51,602
This is part of the movie,
by the way.

435
01:21:51,645 --> 01:21:53,038
And now it's over.
