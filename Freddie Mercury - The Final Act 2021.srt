We'd done the biggest
tour ever of our lives

35
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,040
and Freddie said,

36
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,360
"I can't do this any more after
this." And we went, "Oh."

37
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,960
# Watching some good friends
screaming, "Let me out!"

38
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,680
He didn't at that point want to do
any more live shows,

39
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,840
which sort of told us
that there was something wrong.

My mom visited him more time
than Dad.

42
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,720
And she rang me one day and said, "I
think you should ring your brother

43
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,840
"because he's very, very ill."

44
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,120
And I just said to him,
"It's not Aids, is it?"

45
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,840
And he completely denied it.

46
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,960
But I knew that it was.

47
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,480
There's been a lot of rumours
lately.

48
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,520
The rumours are that we're going to
split up. What do you think?

So forget those rumours.

52
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,440
We're going to stay together

NEWSREADER:  After months of
speculation, the rock star

56
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,960
Freddie Mercury confirmed
at the weekend that he had Aids

57
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,560
and he died last
night at the age of 45.

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,120

has now reached Britain...

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,480
The judgment on homosexual

62
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,760
..killer plague afflicted on mankind
by an outraged God...

63
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,400
BRIAN MAY:  There was this talk of,
"Well, you know, he was gay.

64
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,760
"He kind of deserved it.
You know, he lived that kind

65
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,720
"of promiscuous lifestyle.
It was going to happen."

66
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,560
And we thought, "Oh, my God,
you people have no idea."

67
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,720
We were very angry and we had
to stick up for our friend.

68
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,520
You know, our best friend.

69
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:45,920
So I remember thinking, "Well,
we can do something about it."

Interview with Freddie Mercury,
talking to David Wigg

81
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,880
recorded in Britain.

82
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,640
Um, first of all, what is the
future of the band going to be?

83
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,080
I did some major interviews
with The Beatles

84
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,280
and I was in Chelsea

85
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,840
and Kenny Everett was having
dinner with Freddie.

86
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,600
And as I walked past the table,
Freddie just said, "Oh, by the way,

87
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,720
"I did enjoy your interviews
with the Beatles."

88
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,320
I said, "Well, thank you."

89
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,120
He said, "You haven't done me yet!"

90
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,200
I said, "Well," I said,

91
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,360
"if you'd like me to, I'd be
delighted, of course!" You know.

92
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,480
"Right, come up to Manchester next
week and we're doing a show there,

93
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,040
"and I'll see you after the show."

94
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,560
He was very much...
Freddie was an instant person.

95
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,960
He would make instant decisions
like that.

96
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,000
And we just got on from the start,
you know.

97
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,280
THEY LAUGH

98
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:49,120
Life was for living,
is what Freddie used to say.

99
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,680
Hello, boys and girls.

100
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,360
It's very nice to be in Japan.

101
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,480
Thank you very much for
the reception

102
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,520
and the amazing welcome.

103
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,240
And from me and the boys,
from Queen, thank you very much.

104
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,480
Sayonara.

105
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,400
# Can anybody...

106
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,240
I was very close to Freddie in the
beginning, and I used to share

107
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,040
rooms with him when we were on tour.

108
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,400
So there isn't a lot that
I don't know about Freddie.

109
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,000
# Find me

110
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,520
And he was very shy.
Very uncertain of himself,

111
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,160
uncertain of his sexuality,
for sure.

112
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,840
# Somebody to

113
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,320
I think there was a period where
he felt that we might disapprove

114
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,920
and the rest of the world
might disapprove,

115
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,880
so I think he struggled with it.

116
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,560
I know he did.

117
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,760
And eventually he was able to pluck
up his courage and just completely

118
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,520
be what he wanted to be.

119
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,440
# Each morning I get up
I die a little

120
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,480
# Can barely stand on my feet

121
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,920
#  (Take a look at yourself)
Take a look in the mirror and cry

122
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,360
# (And cry)
Lord, what you're doing to me

123
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,480
He didn't want to go into
big discussions

124
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,440
about his private life, really.

125
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,640
But when Freddie did talk
about it to me, he said,

126
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,240
"What I am is all in the songs."

127
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:09,320
# Can anybody find me
somebody to love?

128
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,880
He was a very sexual animal.

129
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,840
And once he came out, he went wild.
He went wild.

130
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,200
# ..every day of my life

131
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,880
But the most important thing
with Freddie was that the way

132
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,480
he expressed himself, you couldn't
help but realise, you know,

133
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,240
he was always searching
for someone to love.

134
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,400
# Can anybody find me
somebody to love?

135
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,440
Modern medicine is on the march
forward against disease around

136
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,360
the world, but modern lifestyles
bring problems of their own.

137
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,360
Nicholas Bulley has been examining
this phenomenon, particularly

138
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,360
the spread of a recently identified
killer disease called Aids.

139
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,680
Is it more a scare or a scourge?

140
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,520
Aids is really a very alarming

141
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,240
new disease, and it appears

142
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,320
to be a disease that is going
to turn out to be universally fatal.

143
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:13,800
I first became aware of the disease
we call Aids now in late 1981.

144
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,440
I'd previously worked a couple
of times in Brazil for an English

145
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,120
professor of medicine in Brasilia,

146
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,880
and he described
these extraordinary cases

147
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:29,840
he'd been asked to see in New York.
Very unusual infections in gay men,

148
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,760
and he said, "Look, if I'm right,
then this infection

149
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,440
"is already occurring in London."

150
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,960
And then, at the end of 1982,

151
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:43,920
we admitted the first patient
with Aids, as we now call it.

152
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:49,720
We constantly then had increasing
numbers of young gay men

153
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,200
admitted with severe illness.

154
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,920
I'd just come out the Air Force and
I was 20...well, approaching 21.

155
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,480
I met Paul, my boyfriend,

156
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,280
and we moved into Clapham Junction.

157
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,280
# This thing called love

158
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,560
# I just...

159
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,600
I used to go to The Coleherne
and it was a leather bar,

160
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,760
and Freddie liked his...
Leathers and feathers, I called him!

161
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,800
# Get ready!

162
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,480
I wasn't a big Queen fan.

163
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,240
Rock music wasn't my thing,
but I obviously knew who he was.

164
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,400
# This thing called love

165
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:36,880
May I introduce to you, Freddie...
Good start! ..Mercury!

166
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,560
Ladies and gentlemen...

167
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,080
Freddie started seeing
Kenny Everett.

168
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,840
# There goes my baby

169
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,160
They were great friends, and they'd
go off and have a laugh and drinks

170
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,080
at these various gay bars
in Earl's Court.

171
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,560
Do your stuff, Freddie!

172
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,360
It was an eye opener for me, being
that young coming to London.

173
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,040
There was a lot of sexual energy.

174
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,600
# I gotta be cool

175
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,280
The Coleherne had a reputation
for its, like, dark corners

176
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,720
and things like that, and that
was all new to me.

177
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,720
Carefree sex, and, uh,
I didn't embrace it.

178
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,520
But I didn't ignore it.
CHUCKLES

179
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,320
# Crazy little thing called love

180
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,400
The value of the dollar
is up around the world.

181
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,840
Interest rates are down by 40%.

182
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,000
The stock and bond markets
surge upward.

183
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,520
Inflation is down 59%.

184
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,560
Buying power is going up.

185
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,640
Some economic indicators are down,
others are up.

186
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,000
LAUGHTER

187
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,640
It was an enormous struggle to get
governments to take the scale

188
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,000
of this disease seriously.

189
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,080
And indeed, I remember a view
that gay men

190
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,840
were not innocent victims -
they'd brought this on themselves.

191
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,000
Reverend Falwell, you say
Aids is God's judgment

192
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,320
on homosexual promiscuity.

193
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,920
I believe that God does not
judge people, God judges sin,

194
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,640
and I do believe that Aids -

195
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,600
generally caused by homosexual
promiscuity -

196
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,840
is a violation of God's laws,
laws of nature and decency.

197
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:39,000
And, as a result, we pay the price
when we violate the laws of God.

198
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,200
One of Freddie's friends
in New York actually

199
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,400
worked in St Vincent's Hospital,

200
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,520
where a lot of people
were being treated,

201
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:54,760
so it registered that there was
something out there

202
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,640
that could kill you.

203
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,960
But, you know, I think basically
we all thought,

204
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,640
"Well, hopefully
it won't happen to me.

205
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,360
"It just won't happen to me."

206
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:13,960
In 1983, Paul and I,
we went for an STD check.

207
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,120
They took our bloods and we went
back a few days later

208
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,560
and got the results of those,
and, "Oh, by the way,

209
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,560
"you've got this disease
that's hitting New York."

210
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,200
Well, that dreaded new disease,
Aids, has now reached Britain.

211
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,480
Soon after we got the diagnosis,
somebody found out.

212
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,520
And the fact we were living in
Clapham Junction,

213
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,560
we were on the seventh floor,

214
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,080
and we hadn't been in that flat long
and we'd just got it exactly as...

215
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,040
It was our first proper home.

216
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,320
And somebody had painted on
in capital letters

217
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,280
with, like, whitewash paint,

218
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,040
and it just said, "Aids queers"

219
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,200
with an arrow, like this,

220
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,680
going up the seven floors. And then,
when it hit our communal area,

221
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,480
the arrow was pointing
right at the door.

222
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,440
We only found out because we heard
some scrubbing in the morning.

223
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,040
It woke us up.

224
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,480
It was our neighbour next door.

225
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,600
She was in her 80s, and she was
there trying to scrub it off

226
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,320
before we could see it.

227
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,560
BRIAN MAY:  While we were touring, we
would call into radio stations and

228
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,160
TV stations, and sometimes we would
just do promo and not do the gigs -

229
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,920
which is a bit arduous actually,
because the gigs are the nice part.

230
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,280
And I sat in a TV studio, and
I'm not going to tell you where,

231
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,520
and they said, "Oh, right, we'll
play your new video down right now."

232
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,360
# I want to break free.

233
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,120
# I want to break...

234
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,920
They put the video on and they
went, "Oh, well, we'll stop

235
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,320
"right there and we'll change
the subject."

236
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,160
They went pale, they went ashen.

237
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,080
They didn't understand
that it was a pastiche of a soap,

238
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,680
you know, Coronation Street.
They don't have that in America.

239
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,240
They didn't see the funny side.

240
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,240
But even if they had, I don't think
they would have approved.

241
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,360
And it was like, "We can't show
this to our children.

242
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,360
"We can't show this to our audience.
This is a terrible mistake."

243
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,000
# It's strange but it's true

244
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,480
I mean, it didn't go down well
with MTV,

245
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,120
which was obviously very
narrow-minded.

246
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,280
It was one big joke, really,
as far as we were concerned.

247
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,720
We thought it was rather funny.

248
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,840
They really had this whole
attitude of,

249
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,920
"We cannot be seen to support
this kind of thing."

250
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,160
"This kind of thing" meaning
cross-dressing.

251
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,920
And it's funny -
it makes you laugh now,

252
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,880
but it made them drop the record.

253
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,040
The thing with America is
at the time, in the mid-'80s,

254
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,360
the way that people
had to be portrayed had to be so

255
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,600
cotton-candy clean.

256
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,760
You could not be seen to be gay
or you could not come out

257
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,880
during that period.
It was completely hidden.

258
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,120
# But life still goes on

259
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,480
I've heard people say to me,

260
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,680
"Oh, but Freddie denied he was
homosexual."

261
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,760
No, he didn't.
Look at the interviews. Look at it.

262
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,840
The NME asked him in about 1978.
They said, "Are you gay?"

263
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,840
And he said, "As a daffodil, dear!"

264
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,280
That is not a man
denying his sexuality.

265
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,680
But the funny thing is,
people didn't really hear it.

266
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,880
Freddie Mercury was a raving queen,

267
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,680
and he wouldn't mind
anybody saying it.

268
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,480
And it was quite amazing that most
people didn't even think

269
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,280
that Freddie Mercury was gay.

270
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,480
And then you look back
at the history of rock and roll,

271
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,920
and you look at Little Richard...

272
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,600
Let it all hang out!

273
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,120
With the beautiful Little Richard
from down in Macon, Georgia.

274
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,560
Is Little Richard a man trying
to hide the fact that he's gay?

275
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,640
I don't think so.

276
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,760
I am the king of rock and roll!

277
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,120
Oh, oh, oh! My, my, my!

278
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,800
I just had to do that and I feel
so much better I got it out.

279
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,800
And yet nobody talked about it.

280
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,080
Little Richard screamed his passion

281
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,720
in a way that nobody had ever
done it before.

282
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,320
It's incredible, and Freddie
belongs to that genre completely.

283
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,640
I grew up in Singapore and Malaysia,
and I come from a family

284
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,840
of very staunch evangelical
Christians at the time,

285
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,280
and there was a popular perception

286
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,080
coming from America that

287
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,000
a homosexual lifestyle was aberrant

288
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,120
or abnormal and not acceptable.

289
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:41,560
But I persisted with exploring it
until I came out to my friends.

290
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:46,080
# I'd sit alone and watch your light

291
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,760
# My only friend through
teenage nights...

292
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,880
When you're a teenager growing up
gay, you think you're

293
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,160
the only person in the world.

294
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,640
# I heard it on my radio #

295
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,840
I remember Queen. To be honest,
for me, that whole era of the '80s

296
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:07,000
where people were more androgynous
looking and took their shirts off

297
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,040
like Freddie did kind of gave me
hope that there are people being

298
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,840
a bit wild and radical and
different,

299
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,520
and they look like they're OK
so maybe I will be too one day.

300
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,280
I was sitting in front of the TV
on the floor, on the carpet,

301
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,800
watching TV. I think it was
the news or something.

302
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,400
Good evening.

303
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,880
Anything to do with HIV
or anything to do with being gay,

304
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,720
I was hyper attuned to.

305
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,480
Rock Hudson is suffering from Aids
and has been having treatment

306
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,320
for more than a year.
The confirmation came from Paris,

307
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,160
where he's been in hospital
since Sunday.

308
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,440
Rock Hudson was my dad's favourite
actor and I remember him saying,

309
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,680
"Oh, my favourite actor is now
Clint Eastwood."

310
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,600
And it was just a throwaway
comment my dad made,

311
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,200
and I don't think he'd meant
anything bad from it.

312
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,400
But, to be honest, as a teenage
boy who was secretly gay,

313
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,920
because I had that secret
inside me, my heart went cold.

314
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:07,520
Mr Rock Hudson has
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome,

315
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:14,520
which was diagnosed over a year
ago in the United States.

316
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:20,560
He came to Paris to consult
with a specialist in this disease.

317
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:24,320
I had the sort of double whammy
of worrying about my sexuality

318
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,440
and whether that would be accepted
or whether that was acceptable,

319
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,320
and also worrying about whether
I would end up with HIV and die.

320
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,040
# There's no time for us

321
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,160
# There's no place for us

322
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,040
# What is this thing that builds...

323
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:56,400
A few of Freddie's friends
actually died.

324
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,440
The closest was one of

325
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,280
his friends
from New York, John Murphy.

326
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:09,680
# Who wants to live forever

327
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:16,400
# Who wants to live forever

328
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,000
And there were a couple
more people who just...

329
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,360
..disappeared.

330
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,600
# There's no chance for us

331
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,280
# It's all decided for us...

332
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,960
Within the past half hour, we've
heard that the film star

333
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,840
Rock Hudson has died at his home
in California. He was 59.

334
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,720
Rock Hudson dying actually did
affect Freddie.

335
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,840
REPORTER:  News cameras were kept at
a distance as the body was moved

336
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,280
into the coroner's van,
but there was trouble with two

337
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,440
photographers for two
London newspapers.

338
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,480
They were trying to get shots
of the body inside the van.

339
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:05,240
# Who dares to love forever

340
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,680
Hollywood is full of anxious people.
The scourge of Aids, especially

341
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,400
of Rock Hudson's, has cut
through the old myths

342
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,960
about everlasting youth and beauty.

343
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,600
# Forever

344
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:24,200
It made Freddie face the fact
that instead of us being immortal

345
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,840
and it happening to someone else,

346
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,240
it was getting closer and closer
to home.

347
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,600
# Who waits forever anyway? #

348
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,840
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

349
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,640
ROGER TAYLOR:  Well, we did two
Wembley shows and the Knebworth

350
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,480
at the end of the '86 tour.

351
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,760
BRIAN MAY:  We'd sold out two nights
at Wembley, which was extraordinary.

352
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,040
And then there isn't another
date available, so we go

353
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,000
to Knebworth Park and we sell
way over...

354
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,800
I don't know how many people
were there.

355
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,040
People have told me like 130,000
or something.

356
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,760
It was a huge audience, I remember,

357
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,160
and the set just seemed
to float by in a dream.

358
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,240
We'd done the biggest tour ever
of our lives, and it was a great

359
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,920
success and we were very happy.

360
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,760
And Freddie said, "I can't do
this any more after this,"

361
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,280
and we went, "Oh."

362
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,560
After Knebworth, he just felt

363
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,400
that it was taking a lot out of him.
More than normal.

364
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,720
He was fairly firm, the fact that
he didn't at that point want to do

365
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,800
any more live shows,
which sort of told us

366
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,600
that there was something wrong.

367
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:59,080
ANITA DOBSON:  I met Fred in '86 and
I got to see them play at Wembley

368
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:03,400
just before they finished that tour.
And then I got invited to the party

369
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,560
afterwards, and it was at that party
that Fred grabbed my arm and said,

370
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:11,280
"Come and meet my Jim!"
That was his boyfriend, Jim.

371
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,640
And he was very proud of Jim.

372
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,400
We spent ages talking together and
then he took me back to his house

373
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,480
afterwards, and that was really
how our friendship started.

374
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,800
It was that night.

375
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:30,480
Well, he always said London
was his home.

376
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,360
When he got Garden Lodge,
it was beautiful.

377
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,880
And he made the garden into
a Japanese garden

378
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,880
because he loved going to Japan.

379
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,160
He had also found Jim Hutton,

380
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,800
who was there living with him.

381
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,720
They'd devised this thing to say
that he was a gardener.

382
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,240
And I thought, "Well, he's obviously
a very good gardener because he's
there every time I go."

383
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,200
So, yes, I put two and two together.

384
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:06,280
Peter Freestone - Phoebe,
as we called him - was always there.

385
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,280
And Joe, the cook. Our lovely Joe

386
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,480
who used to cook wonderful,
wonderful food.

387
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:16,240
I always enjoyed visiting him
because he'd got a chef,

388
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,760
he'd got a chauffeur.

389
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,440
I liked all those things! But also,

390
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,360
it was lovely to just sit down and

391
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,040
have a chat as a brother and sister,

392
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,080
and we would talk about
all kinds of things, you know.

393
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,640
He had his own family, the Bulsara
family, who were...who are divine.

394
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,040
But he made another family
for himself

395
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:40,080
that was the family that he'd
chosen. The friends from his world,

396
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,880
his new world that he was in,
where Freddie could be Freddie.

397
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:56,560
Freddie loved Japan, and he felt
that he still wanted to put things

398
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:02,200
into Garden Lodge - some
furniture, some porcelain, art.

399
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,440
So he and Jim and Joe Fanelli

400
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,320
went off on a shopping trip!
LAUGHS

401
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,640
He thought that that would be
the perfect place for him

402
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,520
to get back some energy.

403
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,600
And when he came back,
the Sun jumped on him.

404
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,840
"Is this man dying?"
I think it said.

405
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:33,640
That's pretty close to scavenging
carry on that you could get.

406
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,720
What kind of way is that to treat

407
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,000
somebody who's brought a lot
of pleasure to a lot of people?

408
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:45,680
It sort of engendered absolute
hatred in me

409
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:49,480
of the Murdoch press approach.

410
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,720
Once again this morning,
some of the popular press

411
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,080
have been indulging
in their latest pastime.

412
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,200
Headlines like this -
"Danger men in Aids alert."

413
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,080
Talk about a gay plague.

414
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,080
Freddie was a prime target.

415
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,080
I mean, he didn't look sick.

416
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,080
There was absolutely nothing wrong
with him, but he was the famous

417
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,960
person who they sort of knew
was gay so maybe he had it.

418
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,240
So I came out in 1985,
when I'd just turned 16.

419
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,480
I'd started to explore my life
as a young gay man in London.

420
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,080
You know, I made a few friends.

421
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,280
I was going out, hitting the really
small black gay scene

422
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,440
in South London where I grew up.

423
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,440
Just...I think it was a week
after I came out,

424
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,760
Rock Hudson died of Aids.

425
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:49,520
I think I really became aware
of it in late 1986, when my friends

426
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,840
were telling me to go for HTLV-III
tests, which had just become

427
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,440
available in this country.

428
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,920
I wasn't nervous and I wasn't
anxious because I genuinely thought

429
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,680
that I don't have this, because
I'd only had a couple of lovers.

430
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,400
And, in my mind, Aids was something
that was happening across the pond

431
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,560
and there was a narrative that if
you avoided sex with Americans,

432
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,920
which I did, and in my community
if you avoided sex with white men,

433
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,320
which I did, then you
wouldn't get HIV.

434
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,200
And if you were not
having lots of sexual partners,

435
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,760
you wouldn't get HIV.

436
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,200
And I ticked all of those
three boxes.

437
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,440
So I got my tests done at
Westminster Hospital

438
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,480
and I saw a really,
really lovely doctor.

439
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,720
Dr Dolman I think his name was.

440
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,840
And he sat me down and said to me,
you know,

441
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,280
"Sadly, they've come back positive."

442
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,440
And I sat stunned in
absolute silence.

443
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,520
I remember feeling like I was
in a tunnel and everything

444
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:58,440
was closing in on me, and I just
felt that my future would be dark,

445
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,960
would be filled with disease -

446
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,120
a disease I didn't even understand
but I knew it would be painful

447
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,760
and it would be shameful.

448
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:12,120
I was 17 and three months.

449
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,560
# Oh, yes

450
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:21,080
# I'm the great pretender

451
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,280
# Ooh, ooh

452
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,360
I was in that video dressed
in a purple mini dress, I think,

453
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,320
with a sort of yeehaw fringe.

454
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,360
# My need is such

455
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,080
And it was just a laugh
with Freddie.

456
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,920
# I pretend too much

457
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,840
He said I've always fancied,
you know, doing a version

458
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,800
of The Great Pretender.

459
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,640
He said, "It'll be a hit, darling."
And that's exactly what happened.

460
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,360
It came out. I think it was straight
into, like,

461
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,320
number five or four or something,

462
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,640
bounced out and there we were,

463
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,840
off and running.

464
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,240
# I play the game

465
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,840
Freddie had this mark on his hand

466
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,360
and we could see he was worried.

467
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:05,600
He then decided finally
to go to the doctor

468
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,760
because it was just getting
bigger and darker.

469
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:13,240
They did a biopsy and when
the doctor called him,

470
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,320
Freddie would not take the
phone call.

471
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,800
He had all the excuses -
oh, he was in the bath,

472
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,840
he was out, he was somewhere...

473
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,680
He just did not want to talk
to the doctor

474
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:29,440
so I had a very, very good idea
that he knew that this was

475
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:35,200
Kaposi's sarcoma, which was one of
the first indications of Aids.

476
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,960
# I seem to be what I'm not

477
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,160
We were seeing people
being thrown out by their families,

478
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,000
facing violence
from their neighbours,

479
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,120
losing their jobs, the media
attacking them.

480
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,560
So I can only imagine what that must
have felt like for a global

481
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,720
superstar like Freddie Mercury.

482
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,480
There was so much shame,
there was so much stigma,

483
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,640
there were no effective treatments,

484
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,760
so in some ways it was safer to sit
in ignorance, to sit in denial.

485
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:24,040
Interview with Freddie Mercury
in 1987

486
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,880
on the occasion of his birthday,
celebrated in Ibiza.

487
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,880
What do you want to say?

488
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,280
We were sitting around the pool
and it really sent a chill

489
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:38,920
through me because Freddie
had a mauve mark on his cheek.

490
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:43,400
And I knew that people get a sort
of mauve mark

491
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,160
anywhere on their body,

492
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,400
it's a sign they could have HIV.

493
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:51,000
And two hours later,
I had to interview him.

494
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,160
At the end of the interview,
I said to him,

495
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:45,880
"Freddie, I'm going to have to ask
you something. Have you HIV?"

496
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,400
And he said,
"David, is that machine off?"

497
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,920
I said, "Yes, it is off."

498
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:56,760
"Well, if I tell you as a friend,
David, will you promise me

499
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:00,120
"you will not put it
in the article?"

500
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,680
And then I thought, "I know what's
coming," so I said,

501
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,400
"If you don't want to,
then of course not,

502
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,240
"but I just hope it's not
what I think it is."

503
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:13,280
And he said, "Well, I'm afraid it
is, but I'm going to fight it.

504
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,240
"We're going to find a cure.

505
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,280
"End of subject."

506
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:23,600
MARGARET THATCHER:  Civilised society
doesn't just happen.

507
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:29,240
It has to be sustained by standards
widely accepted and upheld.

508
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:33,080
It is time that these things
were said.

509
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,480
# Well, I guess it would be nice

510
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,960
# If I could touch your body...

511
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,280
George, are you gay?

512
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,520
Am I gay? That's a pretty...pretty
direct first question!

513
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,720
I've never said no.
I've never said yes.

514
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,520
The main thing I like to express

515
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,240
is that I don't think
it's anybody's business.

516
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,960
In the 1980s, there was
a culture war.

517
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,160
I'm trying to make people
more tolerant towards things

518
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,520
which aren't harmful.

519
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,760
More gay people were coming out
and demanding our rights.

520
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,240
The only people who have succour
and comfort from your views

521
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,600
are those who beat up, discriminate
and practise abuse

522
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,520
against the gay community.
You ought to be ashamed...

523
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:16,160
At the same time, the Aids pandemic
generated a huge moral panic

524
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,080
against gay and bisexual men.

525
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,600
Children who need to be taught
to respect traditional moral values

526
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,840
have been taught that they have an
inalienable right to be gay.

527
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,240
# Faith, faith, faith

528
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,360
During the 1970s, early 1980s,

529
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,720
public opinion had been shifting
in favour of accepting

530
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,080
gay and lesbian people.

531
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:42,040
But with the advent of the Aids
pandemic, that went into reverse.

532
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,800
The real thing is what is right
and what is wrong.

533
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,920
Government is to ban the promotion
of homosexuality in schools.

534
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:52,280
..clause 28 of the local government
bill would make it an offence for a

535
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,560
local authority intentionally
to promote homosexuality.

536
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,520
..Anderton, Chief Constable
of Greater Manchester, last week

537
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:03,000
castigated homosexuals as engaging
in obnoxious practises and said

538
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,800
the alarming spread of Aids was made
possible by our increasingly

539
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,320
degenerate conduct as a human race.

540
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,760
# Faith, faith, faith

541
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,000
It was vicious.

542
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,160
"Lock them all up." "Gas the gays."

543
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,960
"Put them on an island somewhere."

544
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,360
It wouldn't have existed
but for homosexual behaviour

545
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,280
in this country, and let's say
it straight out without any messing.

546
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,960
Nobody knew anything apart
from the fact that it impacted

547
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,920
young gay men.
So it's not about how much sex

548
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,760
they're having, how they're having
sex, it's who we're having sex with,

549
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,360
right? People hated gay sex.

550
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,400
They didn't like the idea of men
engaging with sex with other men.

551
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:42,560
It's like a gift from God
because it's seen as a plague

552
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,960
afflicted on mankind by
an outraged god.

553
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:50,240
A killer plague against
permissiveness, against illicit...

554
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,480
It's Old Testament, isn't it?
It's biblical.

555
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,040
# I gotta have faith, faith, faith
#

556
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,440
Richard was...

557
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,320
He used to work in Heaven.

558
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,760
They had a little leather concession
shop next to the Star Bar.

559
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,560
I wasn't working, and he said,
"Oh, I can get you a job."

560
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,720
And I said, "Why, where do you
work?" He said,

561
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,960
"I work for John Lewis."

562
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,000
We didn't work together.
I was in china and glass

563
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,320
and he was in fitted kitchens.
He was on the floor below me.

564
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,600
My parents just absolutely
adored him.

565
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:32,120
He was, like, 12 years older
than me.

566
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,520
And he knew upfront about me.

567
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,720
Um, but he never took a test to
begin with

568
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,280
because he always
suspected that he might have it.

569
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,640
And I think a lot of people
did back then.

570
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,800
BRIAN MAY:  These things were not
really spoken of, but of course,

571
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,480
we read the papers, we'd seen what
happened to Freddie,

572
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,600
we saw him disappearing and coming
back with these, uh,

573
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,440
kind of burns to his skin.

574
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,120
# A new life is born...

575
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,920
And I think we didn't like to ask

576
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,040
because we didn't want to know,
perhaps.

577
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,800
And I think that went
on a very long time.

578
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,760
We made a whole album during that
time. We made The Miracle album.

579
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,040
Now!

580
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,360
And Freddie at that time was still
full of energy, but signs

581
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,560
that something is attacking him
because he's got this skin thing

582
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:23,320
going on, and he disappears
for his treatments sometimes.

583
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,840
# I wake up

584
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,440
# Feel just fine

585
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,920
# Your face...

586
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,400
We wanted to think it was something
else, maybe to do with his liver

587
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,840
or something and there was a certain
amount of self-deception going on,

588
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,320
and then I think in the end
it became fairly obvious.

589
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,640
And then, in the end, he sort
of frankly told us.

590
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,120
# Can't you see?

591
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:49,000
The first time we really knew was
when we got together in Montreux,

592
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,800
and Freddie just sat down and said,

593
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,480
"OK, you guys probably know what's
going on with me.

594
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,440
"You know what I'm dealing with.
I don't want to talk about it.

595
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,840
"I don't want to take any action

596
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,960
"apart from carrying
on the way we are.

597
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,160
"I want to keep making music
for as long as I fucking can,

598
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:08,000
"and we will not dwell on it.
We will just go on."

599
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,520
And so we all went, "OK."

600
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,880
And that was it.

601
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,760
Oh, I think our feelings were,
"Goddamn it!" You know?

602
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,200
"Poor Freddie.
Let's all close ranks around him."

603
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,240
He wanted to do nothing but work

604
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,760
because that took his mind
off things.

605
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,440
# If I could only reach you

606
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,080
# If I could make you smile

607
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,440
# If I can only reach you

608
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,840
There was a further discussion
about what attitude we would have

609
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:42,240
if we were questioned, and we all
agreed we would just deny.

610
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,080
To protect Freddie, we would just
say, "Nope, nothing happening,"

611
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,920
and we felt quite
comfortable about that.

612
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:53,760
I was absolutely prepared
to lie through my teeth

613
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,000
right up to the last minute,
you know?

614
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,920
# Break through! #

615
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:08,280
He did say that he has got
an incurable blood disease.

616
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,040
And I just said to him,
"It's not Aids, is it?"

617
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,480
And he completely denied it.

618
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,720
But I knew that it was Aids.

619
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,200
But he didn't want to talk about it
so I respected his wishes.

620
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,680
When we were in the studio,
the studio doors were closed.

621
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,960
We were in there and we had fun.

622
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,520
# And you're rushing headlong,
but there ain't no stopping

623
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,480
# And there's nothing you can do
about it... #

624
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,120
It was a great time, it really was.
It sounds strange to say that,

625
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:43,040
but it really was. For us
as a family, Queen as a family,

626
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,760
it was fantastic.

627
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,560
We were never closer than those
times in Montreux.

628
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:51,960
# Headlong #

629
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,360
But by that time, Freddie
was suffering.

630
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,920
Wherever Aids comes from, and
whoever it attacks, it produces the

631
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,280
same catastrophic, fatal results.

632
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:08,280
People with Aids lose several stone
in weight and suffer many

633
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,680
afflictions like diarrhoea
and breathlessness and brain damage.

634
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:18,440
Richard had CMV - cytomegalovirus,
which was a virus that attacked

635
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:22,640
all the internal organs
and just literally ate away at them.

636
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,240
And he was suffering.

637
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:30,120
Freddie had problems with his eyes.

638
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:35,600
He had to have Ganciclovir,
which was a drip for one hour,

639
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,280
three times a day.

640
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:43,520
He had a Hickman central line put
in. Joe and I were taught

641
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:48,440
how to actually connect up the drip
to give him his medication.

642
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:54,640
When Freddie would see his own
videos, he would say,

643
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,720
"Oh, I was handsome then,"
and that is...that's very,

644
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:01,880
very hurtful, that he knew
what he was going through.

645
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,360
Because I thought my brother
was handsome.

646
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,840
Still do!

647
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:11,320
I really thought that was...
That was so...so sad.

648
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:16,360
This year's Special Award
for an Outstanding Contribution

649
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,200
to British Music goes to
John Deacon,

650
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,920
Brian May, Roger Taylor,
Freddie Mercury - Queen.

651
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,960
Accepting that award,
it was quite hard.

652
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,880
We knew that Freddie obviously
wasn't well,

653
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,240
and it was obvious to everybody.

654
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,840
But, you know, rather than not
accept the award, we just turned up

655
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,640
and took it.

656
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,200
"Thank you very much."

657
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,720
Thank you. Goodnight.

658
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,640
He was really in a lot of pain,
and he never complained. Never.

659
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,200
# Empty spaces

660
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,880
# What are we living for?

661
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,640
# Abandoned places

662
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,240
# I guess we know...

663
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,240
It's a strange story,
The Show Must Go On,

664
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:03,120
because I had the title and a few
words and I had most of the tune

665
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,880
and the chords and everything.

666
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,040
And I called it
The Show Must Go On, and I said

667
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,880
to Freddie, "I'm calling this
The Show Must Go On right now,

668
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,920
"but do you think that's
a bit too corny?"

669
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,320
And he said, "No, no, it's not
too corny at all. It's great.

670
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,200
"We'll do it.
Let's write some words."

671
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,200
So we sat down and started writing
some words, and we were writing

672
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,520
a little story about this clown
who's very sad

673
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,800
but he paints his smile on
so that he still looks happy.

674
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,160
# Another hero

675
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,080
At no point did I say to him,

676
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:34,960
"Well, actually, I was writing this
song about you, Freddie," you know?

677
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:39,320
And he didn't ask. He didn't say,
you know, "Who is this clown?"

678
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:43,040
or whatever. The unwritten thing was
that we didn't discuss

679
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,320
the lower levels.

680
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,440
# The show must go on

681
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,800
When he came in, he wasn't
in a great state.

682
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,280
He was finding it hard to walk,
even finding it hard to sit

683
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,160
because he was in a lot of pain.
I played him the stuff. He said,

684
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:00,000
"It's brilliant. I will sing it,
I will fucking go for it."

685
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,720
He said, "Bring me the vodka!"

686
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,480
I brought him the vodka and he pours
himself a shot,

687
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,280
knocks it down, and then he
props himself up.

688
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,320
Says, "Another one."

689
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,440
Knocks another vodka back and says,
"OK, go for it."

690
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,720
and he went for it. And those notes
came out of him,

691
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,360
and I don't know
where they came from.

692
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,360
Those are very, very high notes -

693
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:20,440
even for Freddie, who had a kind
of operatic section to his voice.

694
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:25,480
# My soul is painted like the wings
of butterflies

695
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:31,120
# Fairy tales of yesterday
will grow but never die

696
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:35,920
# I can fly, my friends

697
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:44,200
And his voice has that high,
wonderful edge that Freddie's voice

698
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,200
always has, but it has a different
kind of timbre underneath it.

699
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,560
You can hear it.

700
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,840
# I'll face it with a grin

701
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,200
# I'm never giving in

702
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,600
# On with the show

703
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,280
It's perfectly obvious to him what
the endgame was going to be.

704
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,000
But while he was still here
and still capable,

705
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,160
he did what he always did.
He worked hard and he was brilliant.

706
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,560
NEWSREADER:  The Princess of Wales
has given a warning

707
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:17,520
of the dangers of growing
prejudice against people with Aids.

708
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,640
It was a very difficult time.

709
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,400
I was a very junior doctor,
so I was carrying out tasks

710
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,320
at the order of my consultant.

711
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:30,360
And it was very hard to get things
done because the minute you said,

712
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,480
"I've got an HIV-positive patient,"

713
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,480
you could hear the person sighing
at the other end of the phone

714
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,640
and then suddenly there
would be no beds.

715
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:41,440
And it was the same sometimes
for investigations.

716
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,480
If you needed a bronchoscopy,
a test to look in the lungs.

717
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,160
And I remember very clearly
being young, frightened,

718
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:52,280
but feeling like I had to put an
armour on, roll my sleeves up

719
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,040
and go into battle.
And that was to get a CT scan!

720
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,360
LAUGHS

721
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,200
Which is kind of ridiculous
when you think about it now,

722
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,880
but it literally was like that.

723
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,840
HIV does not make people dangerous
to know,

724
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:08,840
so you can shake their hands
and give them a hug.

725
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,440
When Richard was in hospital,

726
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,360
he was in there for a year and
I was there every day with him.

727
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,440
You start to notice what's
going on in the ward.

728
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,480
It suddenly hits. You see
the nurses running somewhere

729
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,080
and you know what's happening.

730
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:28,640
And people were dying quickly and
Joe Public didn't really know.

731
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,840
I lost 95% of my friends.

732
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,560
# Sometimes I get the feelin'

733
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,400
# I was back in the old days,
long ago

734
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:49,120
I think Those Were The Days
Of Our Lives was very poignant

735
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,440
because of the video,

736
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,960
because that was the last
video Freddie did.

737
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,280
# The days were endless,
we were crazy...

738
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,160
I think Roger Taylor wrote that.

739
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,120
That was the last video he could do

740
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,360
because he couldn't stand up
for long

741
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:04,280
and he was in great pain.

742
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,760
# I just don't know

743
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,800
Everybody around us that,
you know, worked with us,

744
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,000
some of them hadn't seen Freddie
for a while.

745
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,560
They were very visibly shocked.

746
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:18,120
# Those were the days

747
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:22,400
He could barely stand then, so that
was a very brave thing to do.

748
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,120
But he wanted to do it,
and do it he did.

749
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,880
He just looked very thin and gaunt,

750
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,480
and the hollows seemed
a bit more deeper.

751
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:33,840
He knew what he was facing

752
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,000
and he knew what
he was looking at in the mirror.

753
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,920
# I still love you

754
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,520
It was a nice little sign off
at the end,

755
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,160
I thought was very moving.

756
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,840
# I still love you #

757
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:48,560
It was like a goodbye at the end,
you know?

758
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,920
I remember he said, "Darling,
when I can't sing any more,

759
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,040
"then I die, I'll drop dead.
That's it."

760
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,840
And I think when he'd finished
and he'd sung as much

761
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:02,240
as he could sing, he withdrew

762
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,520
and he got ready to die.

763
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,520
The documentary Aids Updates,

764
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:15,200
it was a series of five ten-minute
programmes over a week.

765
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,840
I cry my eyes out and, you know,

766
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,960
I just get hold of Stuart and I
say, you know,

767
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,840
"Stuart, I can't...
I just can't cope."

768
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:27,520
The idea of it was to dispel
the myths.

769
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,600
Richard was there straight away.
He said, "Yes, we'll do it."

770
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,560
I've made out a will.

771
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,520
Erm...

772
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:40,760
I've spoken to Stuart about
funeral arrangements

773
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:43,800
and how I want, um,

774
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,960
basically how I want my funeral.

775
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,600
He almost caught me out. I was in...

776
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,040
You could smoke in the corridors
of the hospitals then,

777
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,400
and I was having a crafty cigarette.

778
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,320
And I heard somebody shout,
"Stuart!"

779
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:02,040
And I dropped the cigarette,
ran in there.

780
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:08,520
SOBS

781
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,800
I...

782
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,640
I held him.

783
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:19,040
Richard's head was here. I said,
"Baby, let go. Let go."

784
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,920
And he did.

785
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,160
And I felt his breath,
his last breath.

786
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:33,720
The last two weeks of Freddie's
life, there was the same people

787
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:38,280
in Garden Lodge. There was Freddie,
Jim, Joe Fanelli and myself.

788
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:43,280
Joe Fanelli was diagnosed with HIV.

789
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,440
Jim was diagnosed with HIV.

790
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,400
He had already made the decision

791
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,840
he would have no more drugs
that were keeping him alive.

792
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,960
The only thing that he would take

793
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,000
would be painkillers.

794
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,720
And for those last two weeks,
he slowly let go.

795
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:13,280
There was a huge press of media
surrounding the house, you know,

796
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,040
even photographing the groceries
in the back of the car

797
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,320
and, you know...

798
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,640
Uh, it was all pretty sick,
actually.

799
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,600
I think I tried to
run somebody over and failed.

800
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,800
My mum visited him more times
than Dad.

801
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,720
I don't think Dad could take it

802
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:34,680
because he looked like a skeleton
towards the end.

803
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:37,600
And I remember very clearly my dad

804
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,760
was reading one of the many articles

805
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:45,720
and tears were pouring down his face
onto the newspaper,

806
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:50,080
and he said, "This should have
been me instead of Freddie."

807
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,280
I remember that so clearly.

808
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,880
It was so sad.

809
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,440
And now, the shipping forecast.
There are warnings of gales

810
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,480
in Thames, Dover, Wight,
Portland, Plymouth...

811
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:15,360
Joe called me, I think,
at about 5:30 in the morning

812
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:19,960
and Freddie had basically
gone into a coma.

813
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:25,360
So we called the doctor and he made
Freddie sort of comfortable.

814
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:30,200
The doctor had literally
just left the house

815
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:33,640
and we went up, and Freddie
had moved.

816
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,800
You could see he had moved a bit.

817
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:40,720
And as we were changing his T-shirt,

818
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:45,560
we just looked and saw his chest
had stopped moving.

819
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,640
NEWSREADER:  A day after revealing to
the world that he had Aids,

820
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,080
the rock star
Freddie Mercury has died.

821
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,640
The day he died, we spent the whole
night at my house in Kensington

822
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:04,000
at the time, and the three of us
just trying to

823
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,960
make sense of it. And then it came
up on the news in the early morning.

824
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,920
Good morning from Sarah and me.

825
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:13,720
You're watching the BBC's
Breakfast news. It's 6:30.

826
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:17,200
The headlines this morning -
Monday, the 25th of November.

827
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:21,320
Maybe it shouldn't have been,
but it was an awful shock.

828
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:26,480
And Roger and John
and myself got together, sat...

829
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:30,600
Um, kind of had a cup of tea,

830
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:34,200
not knowing what to say.
And then we put the TV on.

831
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:37,640
The pop star Freddie Mercury
died last night in London.

832
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:40,680
We almost stopped breathing
because that's when we believed

833
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,000
that it had actually happened.

834
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,080
The fact that it was on the news
made it real.

835
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,880
I didn't really see much of Jim.

836
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:53,240
I think, not being one that lived
his life in the public eye,

837
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:57,640
he didn't want any of that,
so...withdrew.

838
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,080
The lead singer with Queen, aged 45,

839
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,000
had announced on Saturday
he was suffering from Aids.

840
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,440
It was announced before he died,
but he didn't want to go through

841
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:10,880
the misery of being
the object of pity, or scrutiny,

842
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,360
you know, when you're that sick,

843
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,520
so he did announce it,

844
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,280
and within 24 hours, he was gone.

845
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:22,400
So I think that was probably
perfect timing.

846
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,320
Bloody good move, I thought.

847
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,840
OK.  OK?

848
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,240
Yeah.

849
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,840
Rolling?  Rolling.

850
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:35,600
Freddie Mercury, er,
was an incredible, er,

851
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,560
innovative singer

852
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:40,040
and frontman for a band.

853
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,880
He was a very dear friend of mine
and it was a privilege

854
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:46,480
to have known him
for some of his life.

855
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:51,240
The press was full of what
a wonderful performer Freddie was,

856
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:53,640
what amazing music he wrote.

857
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:58,560
Everybody had been saying such
wonderful things, nice things.

858
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,760
How very quickly that changed.

859
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,880
The press were pretty shitty,
as they normally were.

860
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:10,080
Freddie dying of Aids,
Freddie sleeping around,

861
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,120
so he got what he deserved.

862
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:16,240
Yeah, I wouldn't single anybody out,
except maybe The Sun, I think,

863
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,840
were particularly awful about it.

864
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,040
There was some nice press,

865
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,080
there were some people who were
very nice,

866
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:26,200
but there were people who were
unbelievably unsympathetic.

867
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:30,840
730,000 people using the Aids
helpline last year,

868
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,080
those people seeking
help and advice.

869
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,640
We've got to be able to give it
in school, but we've got

870
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,880
to be able to give it as part
of a total picture,

871
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:41,400
so that we don't have a great
hoo-ha when Freddie Mercury died,

872
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:44,520
because he had such a bizarre, and,
in my view,

873
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,800
quite unacceptable lifestyle.

874
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,920
There was this talk of,
well, you know, he was gay,

875
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:51,120
he kind of deserved it,
you know, he lived that kind

876
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,760
of promiscuous lifestyle.

877
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,000
It was going to happen.

878
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,680
You know, that, that...

879
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:59,440
And we thought, Oh, my God,
you people have no idea

880
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,920
of what this disease really is,

881
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,760
and obviously no feeling

882
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:07,840
about the morality
of what you're saying.

883
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,440
Roger Taylor and Brian May
are with us.

884
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,000
The death of Freddie Mercury...

885
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:16,920
Brian and I decided to say something
on breakfast TV or something.

886
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:20,240
It's been quite distressing to read
some of the, erm, the reports

887
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,320
in the press.

888
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:24,600
Not quite sure what we want to do,
but just to say that this press

889
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,520
is disgusting,

890
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,280
and what a terrible attitude,

891
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,120
and, er, there we were,
stuck with Paul Daniels.

892
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,040
Paul Daniels is listening here.

893
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,280
Were you a fan of Queen
and of Freddie Mercury?

894
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,520
Well, no, cos I...

895
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,160
We were in a bit
of a daze, to be honest.

896
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,240
It hit us very hard.

897
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,080
We were very angry,

898
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,600
and we had to stick up
for our friend,

899
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,600
you know, our best friend.

900
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,040
Freddie made one crucial
decision before he died,

901
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,600
which was to announce the fact
that he did have Aids.

902
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:57,960
It was a very brave, and, I think,
well-timed act on his part,

903
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:01,960
because it gave us and those close
to us a kind of weapon

904
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,560
erm, to talk about Aids, you know,

905
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:06,240
it would have been very easy for him
to put on his death certificate,

906
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,720
pneumonia, you know, which he knew,

907
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:10,080
and it could have perhaps
sidestepped the whole thing.

908
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,880
The fact that he announced it,
and said, "Look, I've got this",

909
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:16,240
and he was, there was no shame
to that, I think is very important,

910
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:19,480
cos there shouldn't be from this
point, well, not from ANY point,

911
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,720
any stigma to having this disease.

912
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:24,520
It's nothing to do with, you know,
somebody did something wrong.

913
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:26,720
He's being punished.
That's got to go. It has to go,

914
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:29,120
you know, it's everybody's problem
now.

915
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,520
At that point, we thought
we're not going to let Freddie

916
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,800
be perceived in history as a victim,

917
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,920
or as someone who threw himself
in front of a train,

918
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:39,480
and if we're going to talk
about Aids, we should bring

919
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,960
everything out into the open.

920
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,920
Freddie isn't the only person
who is being vilified...

921
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,320
..before AND after his death

922
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:51,040
by people who think that Aids is
some kind of revenge

923
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,320
against gay people.

924
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:57,280
# Is this the real life? #

925
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:01,400
I felt that it was a waste
of a lovely, talented life.

926
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,760
# Is this just fantasy? #

927
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:08,200
But also for those people who died
in the same period as Freddie,

928
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:12,760
it was such a bad stigma,
and the shame behind it all,

929
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:15,600
that a lot of families didn't
understand.

930
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:18,360
# Caught in a landslide

931
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,760
# No escape from reality. #

932
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,600
People died on their own,
which I thought is such a shame.

933
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,400
# Open your eyes... #

934
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:29,800
Queen is to rerelease its best-known
hit Bohemian Rhapsody next month,

935
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,440
with the proceeds going
to an Aids charity.

936
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:35,880
You have doubts about everything.
You think, are we capitalising on
his death?

937
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,400
Is this maybe a tasteless thing
to do?

938
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,760
And we thought, no, we put it out,

939
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:40,560
and all the profits
will go to charity.

940
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:43,720
I think one of the results
of his life can be that people

941
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:45,760
have a different attitude
to people being gay.

942
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,040
I really hope so.

943
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:50,440
Here's a guy who was strong,
who was incredibly talented,

944
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,720
quite magnificent in every way
you can think of,

945
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,120
and he was gay,
and was quite public about it.

946
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,720
So I don't think anyone
can ever quite feel the same

947
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:01,080
about that any more,
and it's time, God knows, you know?

948
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,720
# Too late

949
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,840
# My time has come... #

950
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:11,120
Obviously, the band was effectively
finished at that point,

951
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:14,400
so I remember thinking,
well, what can we do?

952
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,680
# Goodbye, everybody... #

953
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:20,640
Well, we could have a concert
to honour our friend,

954
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:24,880
and I became sort of fixated with
the idea of giving him

955
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,560
a hell of a send-off,

956
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:31,360
and at the same time, promoting
awareness about HIV, Aids.

957
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:39,000
I remember showing Brian, "Look,
I reckon we can get this lot, here,

958
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,280
you know, all these great artists".

959
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:44,040
He said, "Well, I don't know".

960
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,440
He didn't really believe in it,
I think, at first,

961
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:50,880
then it's, "Well, if you can get
that lot, I'm in".

962
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,560
I remember I went in to
Harvey Goldsmith, the promoter,

963
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:58,600
with our manager, Jim Beach,
and he looked up, and we said,

964
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,640
"We want Wembley Stadium".

965
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,560
And he said, "Who's going to sing?"

966
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,880
And so we said,
"Well, I've got this list".

967
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:10,600
And he just looked at me,
and said, "You're mad".

968
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,880
And I thought, "Well, are we?
Maybe we are".

969
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:20,280
I'm the wet nappy service that runs
24 hours a day, that's what I do.

970
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:23,760
Booking Wembley Stadium,
speak to the bookings department,

971
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,800
and say is May the 4th available,

972
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,200
and if they say yes,
they send you a contract,

973
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:32,160
and you have to pay them
a load of money.

974
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,200
That's it!

975
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:39,480
Once that date's set, that show's
happening, so then the question is,

976
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,520
who do we get?

977
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:47,320
Well, I think the first person
I called was Elton,

978
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,680
because I knew he was a shoo-in.

979
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,840
Elton and Freddie were great
friends, and I know Elton

980
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:56,960
was particularly supportive
in the last days.

981
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:00,560
Just what you would want
from a really good friend.

982
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,320
And I rang up David Bowie.

983
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,320
I said, you know, you can do
Under Pressure.

984
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,840
And he said,
"Well, who would I sing it with?"

985
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:10,040
And I thought, I know Annie
Lennox loves David Bowie.

986
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:12,160
He said,
"Well, I'll do it with Annie".

987
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,760
So I rang up Annie,

988
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:17,600
and I said, "Bowie will do it".
She said, "I'll do it".

989
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:18,960
Two psychiatrists...

990
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,680
No, rather, two psychics
pass each other on the street,

991
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,880
and one says to the other,

992
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:26,400
"You're doing all right. How am I?"

993
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,800
And it kind of went on from that.

994
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,360
First of all,
how are the rehearsals going here?

995
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:36,760
They're going tremendously well,
I mean, er,

996
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:40,720
I think Queen themselves have taken
on an incredible amount of work.

997
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:44,560
# Mm ba-ba, mm ba-ba

998
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,440
# Bada-boom ba-bai-ya... #

999
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:50,880
You know, we'd lost Keith Moon,
so I knew what they were going

1000
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:53,440
to be going through, emotionally,
themselves,

1001
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,520
and it's incredibly traumatic,

1002
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:56,680
I can't tell you.

1003
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:57,960
# Pressure

1004
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:59,920
# Pushing down on me

1005
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,800
# Pressing down on you

1006
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,840
# No man ask for

1007
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,000
# Under pressure... #

1008
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,120
David Bowie's doing it, and then
Roger Daltrey's doing it,

1009
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,440
Robert Plant's doing it.

1010
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,720
All kinds of people who were
really heroes to us.

1011
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:16,520
# It's the terror of knowing
what this world is about... #

1012
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,800
And then a lot of people
who were there, younger than us,

1013
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:22,560
to who Freddie had been a hero,
so, Extreme, Metallica,

1014
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,080
Guns N Roses,

1015
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:27,080
and everybody said, "Ah!
Guns N Roses will never turn up!"

1016
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,640
# People on streets...#

1017
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:31,640
Everybody was there.

1018
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:35,280
It was just like a sort of
fame fest. Ha-ha!

1019
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,120
I'm doing I Want To Break Free.

1020
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:39,880
I'm doing that on my own,

1021
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:42,320
and I'm doing a duet
with George Michael.

1022
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:44,640
I'm doing
These Are The Days Of Our Lives.

1023
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,280
They offered me this song,

1024
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:48,080
I Want To Break Free,

1025
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:50,960
and I said to Roger Taylor,

1026
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:55,040
"I hope you don't think
that this is really bad taste,

1027
00:58:55,040 --> 00:59:00,480
"but do you think it would be really
good if I had a vacuum cleaner

1028
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:05,040
"on the stage, and put rollers
in a net in my hair,

1029
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,840
"like Freddie on the video?"

1030
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,800
And Roger Taylor was so lovely,
and he got hold of me,

1031
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,080
and he just said,

1032
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:14,920
"Bad taste is what this band
is all about, darling!"

1033
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:17,440
And it was so lovely,
and that's it,

1034
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,880
that was that.

1035
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:24,440
I think at rehearsals,
there was a definite feel of respect

1036
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:25,960
and a responsibility.

1037
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:27,880
# Pressure...

1038
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:29,120
# Pressure. #

1039
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:32,400
It's scary enough to play
with Queen anyway, and also thinking

1040
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,920
that you're taking the place
of someone that was such

1041
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:36,640
an incredible performer.

1042
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:42,240
Queen were the first concert
we ever saw.

1043
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,480
We were 11.

1044
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:46,000
I mean, we were enthralled.

1045
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,840
So George's only stipulation
was that he wanted to sing

1046
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,240
Somebody To Love.

1047
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:55,080
# Each morning, I get up,
I die a little

1048
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:58,280
# Can barely stand on my feet

1049
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:02,040
# Take a look in the mirror and cry

1050
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:04,720
# Lord, what are you doing to me? #

1051
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:08,200
"I look in the mirror every
morning and I cry and cry.

1052
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:10,880
"Please, God,
send me someone to love".

1053
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,280
# Lord!

1054
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,960
#  (Somebody)  Oh, somebody

1055
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:18,520
#  (Somebody)  Can anybody find me

1056
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:21,400
# Somebody to love? #

1057
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,040
He had the world at his feet,

1058
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,960
sold a hundred million
records by this time.

1059
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,760
# I work hard  (He works hard)

1060
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,360
# Every day of my life... #

1061
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:34,400
But he never found love,
and that was tough for him.

1062
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,640
#  (At the end of the day)
I take home my hard-earned pay... #

1063
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:42,640
I was very close to George, and
George was a very complicated guy.

1064
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:48,120
We all knew that George was gay,
and at the time, he clearly hadn't

1065
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:50,320
come to terms with it himself.

1066
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:54,000
# Can anybody find me

1067
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,160
# Somebody to love? #

1068
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,920
So, when I was 19, I came out
to various friends,

1069
01:00:58,920 --> 01:00:59,960
and one of my sisters,

1070
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:02,000
and I said I was going to talk to
my mum and dad,

1071
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,920
and was persuaded,
in no uncertain terms,

1072
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:07,400
that it really wasn't the best idea.

1073
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:11,280
There was this sort of weird stigma
attached to it all,

1074
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:14,320
and it was like because he was
this sex symbol

1075
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:17,680
that he couldn't come out
of the closet.

1076
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:21,280
This was one lie that I'd been
kind of trying to tell people

1077
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,280
in my own way for years
and years, and I don't think

1078
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,120
I would have had the same career.

1079
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:30,160
My ego might not have been satisfied
in some areas quite as much,

1080
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,280
but I think I would
have been a happier man.

1081
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:40,480
The week of rehearsals,
we were there four days out of five,

1082
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:43,000
and that's where that video
comes from, me and him,

1083
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,600
behind Roger's drum kit,

1084
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:50,560
watching Bowie and Annie Lennox,
that was the last day,

1085
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:52,600
and when they finished,

1086
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:55,240
he did his rehearsal, yet again.

1087
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:58,440
Four days in a row.
No-one did that.

1088
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:02,720
# Can anybody find me... #

1089
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:05,160
There's a definite feeling when
George went out and did

1090
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:07,480
Somebody To Love
that he'd absolutely nailed it.

1091
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:11,960
# Somebody t-o-o-o-o-o-o-o... #

1092
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:16,920
There weren't any tantrums,
there wasn't anything like that.

1093
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:20,760
#  (Find me somebody)...  #

1094
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:24,120
Nobody was more important
than anybody else.

1095
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:27,160
There wasn't one person
who was making a fuss,

1096
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,160
cos there's always usually one.

1097
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:38,160
L-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-v-v-v-v-e? #

1098
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,200
All right!

1099
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,360
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1100
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:47,080
The old school building
in Notting Hill has become Britain's

1101
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:50,320
first purpose-built Aids hospice.

1102
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:52,200
I'd been working at...

1103
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,000
Well, not working,
I'd been volunteering

1104
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,760
at London Lighthouse.

1105
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,360
People with HIV could...

1106
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:05,360
..go for respites, go for security,
go for counselling,

1107
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:07,600
and their friends could go along
to visit them.

1108
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,320
It was a safe place.

1109
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:13,520
And I managed to get tickets through
one of my friends who worked there.

1110
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:19,200
I've never been a concert-goer.
Apart from Tina Turner, bizarrely.

1111
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,360
And so I had to go to Wembley -

1112
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:22,240
I'd never been to a football match
at Wembley,

1113
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,000
so I wasn't aware of
the space of it.

1114
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,840
And when we got there,
it was like, wow.

1115
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:31,280
CROWD ROARS

1116
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,440
A very good afternoon.

1117
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:35,160
PRESENTER: Freddie Mercury died of
Aids in November of last year.

1118
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:37,480
Love and respect for the man,
together with a passionate

1119
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,720
commitment to do something
about the disease,

1120
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:42,280
has led to this event.
Some of the great names in world...

1121
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:46,680
We had great seats and I felt
privileged to be there.

1122
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:51,480
72,000 packed inside, tens
of thousands are still arriving

1123
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:55,240
and half a billion people watching
on TV, on satellite

1124
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:57,040
around the world.

1125
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:59,880
In a way, the concert is quite
important for us cos it's our way

1126
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:01,760
of saying goodbye to Freddie
as well.

1127
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,920
And I think we need to do
that before our minds

1128
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,320
can really move on.

1129
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:12,120
Good evening, Wembley and the world!

1130
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:14,400
CROWD CHEERS

1131
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:18,560
We are here tonight to celebrate

1132
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:23,560
the life and work and dreams
of one Freddie Mercury.

1133
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:25,920
CROWD CHEERS

1134
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:29,640
You have to have something
that attracts people to hear

1135
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:33,520
the message that needs to be said,
and nothing on this planet

1136
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,080
will ever beat music.

1137
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:40,360
They're number one
all over the world right now.

1138
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:43,480
Please welcome on stage Def Leppard!

1139
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,840
CROWD CHEERS

1140
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:48,160
Good evening!

1141
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,280
Are you all enjoying yourselves?

1142
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:53,480
It unites people.

1143
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:57,160
MUSIC: Now I'm Here
by Queen

1144
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:00,360
# Here I stand
Here I stand

1145
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:02,680
# Looked around, around,
around... #

1146
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:06,840
'Essentially, what we have with
this show is the celebration

1147
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,040
'of the life of a musician'

1148
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:14,040
who just happened to be gay, who
died of the consequences of Aids.

1149
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:17,040
# Now I'm there
Now I'm there... #

1150
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:22,440
That in itself is incredible and
juxtaposition in 1992,

1151
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:25,960
because it was improving,
but it was still a homophobic world.

1152
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:29,360
# Just a new man

1153
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:32,320
# Yes, you made me live again... #

1154
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:35,400
'And I think that fact that you've
got this, what you might call,

1155
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:39,240
very heterosexual rock opening
up the show for the first hour,

1156
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:42,000
I think that juxtaposition is
actually beneficial.

1157
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,320
# A baby I was when you took my hand

1158
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:48,280
# The light of the night
burned bright... #

1159
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:51,720
'If you'd have just been an entirely
gay collection of musicians,

1160
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:52,920
'it wouldn't have worked.'

1161
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:55,320
# But you knew my name on sight... #

1162
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:59,520
If you look back at how the show
flowed and who performed on it,

1163
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,840
it doesn't really make any sense.

1164
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:04,280
Please welcome Metallica.

1165
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:08,160
'The last thing you'd expect
is a band like Metallica

1166
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:10,240
'to be playing an Aids
awareness show'

1167
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,680
and a tribute to Freddie Mercury.

1168
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:14,480
# Don't I love you so... #

1169
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:18,360
Here for Aids awareness
is Guns N' Roses.

1170
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:20,640
This is Guns N' Roses, 1992.

1171
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:23,600
They were completely off their face.

1172
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:27,000
I remember seeing Duff, bless him,
sat on the stairs.

1173
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,360
He couldn't even speak.

1174
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:29,880
He couldn't speak.

1175
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:32,160
And this is an hour before
they went on.

1176
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:33,920
How are you feeling
before you go on?

1177
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:36,040
I just woke up.
You just woke up?

1178
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:39,200
And I'm thinking,
"Oh, boy, I can't wait to see this."

1179
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,640
Yet when they went on stage,
he was amazing.

1180
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:44,800
# Whatever comes of you and me

1181
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,680
I'd love to leave my memory... #

1182
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:49,000
'There would have been a lot of
heterosexual people

1183
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,280
'that loved Queen that went,'

1184
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:52,240
"Oh, I'm not keen on
the gay lifestyle bit."

1185
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,280
But to the majority,
most people just didn't care.

1186
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:00,440
They were there to celebrate Fred.

1187
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:02,760
Thank you! See you soon, all right?

1188
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,120
Goodnight!

1189
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:06,960
BIG ROCK CRESCENDO

1190
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:09,800
CHEERING FADES

1191
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:17,360
I first discovered Queen
in my last years at school.

1192
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:22,120
Everybody at school was saying
how I looked like Freddie Mercury.

1193
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:23,640
The man changed my life.

1194
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:28,080
From being a 16-year-old blood
getting mick took out of him

1195
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:30,360
for goofy teeth and Bugs Bunny

1196
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:33,200
to being a good-looking chap
who could go round town

1197
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,960
and sing and dance.

1198
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:37,120
It just changed me completely.

1199
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:40,000
Are you ready?

1200
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,520
MUSIC: Another One Bites the Dust
by Queen

1201
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,160
'There was this one'

1202
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:50,040
guy who was dressed like Freddie
on someone's shoulders.

1203
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:51,160
Do it!

1204
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:55,720
He encapsulated that audience
for me.

1205
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:59,360
Every gesture, every motion,
it was bleeding out of him.

1206
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:02,400
MUSIC: Keep Yourself Alive
by Queen

1207
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:06,920
He just looked and then he did,
like, a double take...

1208
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:08,600
# Keep yourself alive
Come on

1209
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:09,800
# Keep yourself alive... #

1210
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:12,160
..and he just started laughing,
and I remember that

1211
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,720
like it were yesterday.

1212
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:16,360
MUSIC: Radio Ga Ga
by Queen

1213
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:18,520
# All we hear is... #

1214
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:22,520
You could see individuals
celebrate the music and, you know,

1215
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:24,680
lose themselves
and express themselves.

1216
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:25,720
Sing it!

1217
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:29,360
# All we hear is radio ga ga

1218
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:30,800
# Radio, what's new...? #

1219
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:34,960
'It wasn't just another singalong -
it was more than that.'

1220
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:36,480
It was visceral.

1221
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:42,840
# Someone still loves you. #

1222
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:45,840
Thank you!

1223
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:49,960
'Of course, we were the beginning
of the event,'

1224
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:52,240
and it was that way
throughout the whole day.

1225
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:53,400
Goodnight!

1226
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:02,400
CROWD CHEERS

1227
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:06,080
CROWD CHANTS "FREDDIE, FREDDIE!"

1228
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:10,120
I think I learned that day just

1229
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:15,120
what an incredible force he was,

1230
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:19,520
not just his voice,
but the man himself.

1231
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:27,000
All right, we're about to go in to
the second half of the concert

1232
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,760
in which the three members of Queen
will perform with a remarkable

1233
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:33,240
series of collaborators.

1234
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:37,280
There was an energy that day
that was unbelievable.

1235
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:41,200
Next, the lead singer
from The Who, Roger Daltrey,

1236
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:44,680
along with Brian May, Roger Taylor
and John Deacon from Queen.

1237
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,760
MUSIC: Pinball Wizard
by The Who

1238
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:51,600
And it was because of one person.

1239
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:56,800
They lost Freddie, so I can imagine
what they were going through.

1240
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:00,320
It must have been incredibly
traumatic, but I'm sure that once

1241
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:03,960
they heard their music again,
even though it's being done

1242
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:07,880
differently by me and the other
artists, it must have just

1243
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:09,120
given them a lift.

1244
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:10,520
MUSIC: I Want It All
by Queen

1245
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:12,880
# I want it all

1246
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:18,000
# I want it all
I want it all

1247
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,680
# And I want it now... #

1248
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:26,240
I think for the boys,
it was a catharsis.

1249
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:30,240
It was a way of saying goodbye,
but saying goodbye in front

1250
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:35,160
of everybody, saying this was
someone we loved deeply.

1251
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:38,520
Our next guest is Mr Paul Young.

1252
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:40,480
I did feel the sense of loss
in the stadium.

1253
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:44,320
I mean, I felt that the fans were
there to celebrate Freddie.

1254
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:48,000
# All we hear is radio ga ga... #

1255
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,280
'But I did feel it'

1256
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:51,160
from the band as well.

1257
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:55,080
It was like my childhood
was all coming on stage -

1258
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:58,120
all the singers that I'd idolised.

1259
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:01,840
# Pray tomorrow takes me higher

1260
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:05,800
# Pressure on people,
people on streets... #

1261
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:08,240
When you say stepping into
his shoes, that really brings

1262
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:10,960
it home, you know, cos that's
what we were trying to do.

1263
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:13,040
'Please, give me a break!'

1264
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:15,440
I was not trying to be
Freddie Mercury.

1265
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:17,560
'You do your best.
That's all you do.'

1266
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:20,200
# I want it all

1267
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:24,640
# I want it all
I want it all

1268
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:27,160
# And I want it now... #

1269
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:30,200
I know it sounds really,
really corny,

1270
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:34,760
but it was really like he was
watching and if he'd have been

1271
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:37,680
there, he's have been saying,
"No, do it like that and you do

1272
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:41,080
it like that," so you were trying to
listen to what he would say.

1273
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:43,800
# I want to break free
from your lies

1274
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:49,400
# You're so self satisfied
I don't need you... #

1275
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:50,920
'And you really wanted to'

1276
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:54,400
make him feel proud and you wanted
to make Queen feel proud.

1277
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:55,920
# God knows. #

1278
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:58,560
You know, it's all about
the band, as well.

1279
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:01,480
And they played so well,
Roger and Brian and John.

1280
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:03,320
And I'm just pleased for them.

1281
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:05,200
It's going to be a very
emotional day for them.

1282
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:08,080
MUSIC: Bohemian Rhapsody
by Queen

1283
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:14,840
# Mama

1284
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:17,440
# Just killed a man... #

1285
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:21,160
Well, it was obvious why it was
important for Elton to perform

1286
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:25,200
because he was the most
vocal of all the gay musicians.

1287
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:30,680
# Mama, life had just begun... #

1288
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:36,440
Elton and Freddie were very close,
and I remember Elton

1289
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:38,840
during the rehearsals being
just very sombre.

1290
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:41,280
# Mama

1291
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:42,960
# Oooh... #

1292
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:49,000
With Axl Rose, he had the
reputation for turning up at a gig

1293
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:53,120
and then going on stage two hours
late, and all the rest of it,

1294
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:56,320
and there was a lot of controversy
about Axl.

1295
01:12:56,320 --> 01:13:00,920
Axl said some fairly unwise and
could be construed as

1296
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:04,080
homophobic statements.

1297
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:08,480
'And one of my real dreams at
the time was to get them together'

1298
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:10,280
on Bohemian Rhapsody.

1299
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:14,960
# Goodbye, everybody,
I've got to go... #

1300
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:18,120
But we never knew if Axl
was actually going to turn up,

1301
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:24,280
cos he didn't turn up to rehearsals
and he was famously unpredictable.

1302
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:26,680
It was such a dangerous thing to do
at the time.

1303
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:30,400
Axl Rose and Elton John,
you know what I mean?

1304
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:33,120
You'd imagine it to be
the biggest road crash ever.

1305
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:37,840
# I sometimes wish
I'd never been born at all... #

1306
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:40,040
We left our door open
so that we could see

1307
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:42,040
who was milling around outside.

1308
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:45,480
We saw Elton walk past our door
and then he kind of must have done

1309
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:49,160
a John Cleese and he stopped
and walked backwards and kind

1310
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:51,720
of just leaned in and went,
"Hello, boys."

1311
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:54,600
Then he came in a little while later
and he went, "What's going on?"

1312
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:57,760
He says, "I've got to sing a duet
with this guy in four hours' time,

1313
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:59,560
"and he won't open his door."

1314
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:02,840
# I see a little silhouetto
of a man... #

1315
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:05,640
Apparently, he knocked on the door
and his security guy just opened

1316
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:08,120
the door a little bit and said,
"Axl's sleeping,"

1317
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:09,400
and he shut the door.

1318
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:11,840
It's like, you don't shut
the door on Elton John.

1319
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:14,760
And he vented his spleen
in our dressing room.

1320
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:17,760
"I've got to do a duet.
He's not opening the door.

1321
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,400
"I'm Elton John!"

1322
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:22,000
Fucking hell!
It was really funny, actually.

1323
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,240
# Let me go

1324
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:24,360
# Ah

1325
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:26,200
# No, no, no, no, no, no, no... #

1326
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:27,240
And I'm thinking,

1327
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:30,320
it'll be interesting to see
how this works out.

1328
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:32,360
And I just sort of looked round,

1329
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:34,120
thinking, is he going appear?

1330
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:37,920
And he suddenly appeared
like a whirling dervish

1331
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:39,520
in a Scottish kilt.

1332
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:47,200
And he was absolutely fantastic,
I thought he was electric.

1333
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:51,920
# So you think you can stop me
and spit in my eye

1334
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:58,480
# So you think you can love me
and leave me to die

1335
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:02,400
# Oh, baby

1336
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:05,560
# Can't do this to me, baby

1337
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:10,640
# Just gotta get out,
just gotta get right outta here...
#

1338
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:14,440
If there was anybody in the crowd
that wasn't keen on him doing it,

1339
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:17,720
they didn't seem to show it cos I've
never seen a reaction like it.

1340
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:23,080
But then there was this, like, total
kind of polar opposite of when it

1341
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:25,200
goes down to the end section.

1342
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:30,840
# Nothing really matters,

1343
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:34,440
# Anyone can see

1344
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:38,400
# Nothing really matters... #

1345
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:42,120
The two of them come together,
and my memory serves me right,

1346
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:44,240
for a brief second, they held hands.

1347
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:48,920
# ..to me. #

1348
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:52,680
'And the two of them went
down the front and held hands

1349
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:53,920
'at the end of the song.

1350
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:55,080
'That wasn't rehearsed.

1351
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:57,960
'There's a lot you see in that
concert which was not rehearsed.

1352
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:00,920
'It wasn't rehearsed because
Axl wasn't at rehearsals.'

1353
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:02,560
And it's momentous.

1354
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:08,960
# Any way the wind blows... #

1355
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:13,680
CROWD CHEERS

1356
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:30,240
It's very hard to quantify
what impact the concert had.

1357
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:32,680
ANNOUNCER:  Ladies and gentlemen,
would you please welcome

1358
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:34,960
the remarkable Elizabeth Taylor?

1359
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:37,480
But what I can say with utmost

1360
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:40,520
certainty is it did open up a public

1361
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:43,000
conversation and together with

1362
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:47,800
the actions of HIV and Aids,
organisations began to shift

1363
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,680
public attitudes.

1364
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:55,280
We are here to celebrate the life
of Freddie Mercury.

1365
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,520
It was tricky for us.

1366
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:01,120
On one level, we're saying,

1367
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:04,160
this is celebrating his life,
this is the strong statement.

1368
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:06,680
And on the other hand, we're
thinking, ouch, you know,

1369
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:12,040
this actually does hurt us.
And it was bound to do.

1370
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:14,960
# Day dum

1371
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:16,800
# Day de day de day dum. #

1372
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:23,000
We are here also to tell
the whole world

1373
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:30,440
that he, like others we have lost
to Aids, died before his time.

1374
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:34,120
Freddie's tribute, to me, was
like a tribute to Richard as well,

1375
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:37,320
and the thousands
that had died before him.

1376
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:40,120
# Ay dum. #

1377
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:42,600
He's one of the people that
I thought about for a long, long

1378
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:47,360
time because he kind of represented
a cohort of patients that died.

1379
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:52,440
Some when I was with them alone late
at night in a high dependency ward

1380
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:56,160
trying my best, but it didn't work.

1381
01:17:56,160 --> 01:18:00,560
Each day around the world,

1382
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:05,360
5,000 people are infected with HIV,

1383
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:07,840
the virus that causes Aids.

1384
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:13,400
Tonight, we're here to send them
a message that we care.

1385
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:16,760
It wasn't that long after
that effective treatment arrived.

1386
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:21,760
I would think, Oh, Freddie
and this gang of guys, mostly guys,

1387
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:25,480
would be still alive today
if they had these treatments.

1388
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:28,560
But they didn't - they were
just a few years too early.

1389
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:32,880
But I'm also here
with a message for each

1390
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:38,040
and every one of you - protect
yourselves, love yourselves,

1391
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:39,920
respect yourselves,

1392
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:44,640
because I will keep on telling you
until you do and I won't give in.

1393
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:50,560
And I won't give up because
the world needs you to live.

1394
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:53,760
HUGE CHEER

1395
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:03,440
It happened with Anselmo
across a lobby.

1396
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:07,520
So I met him in that lobby

1397
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,080
and I didn't understand why

1398
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:10,160
the click happened.

1399
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:12,120
This is a man in a Brazilian hotel.

1400
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:14,360
I'm never going to see him again.

1401
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:16,520
Why did that happen?

1402
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:19,640
This was the first love
of my entire life.

1403
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:23,840
This was the first person
I ever shared my life with.

1404
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:27,000
It was love at first sight.

1405
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:30,840
He was a fashion designer,
very talented man.

1406
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:35,480
At the time, I was married
and we hid Anselmo

1407
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:37,720
as my wife's cousin.

1408
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:40,400
And he was everything to George.

1409
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:44,440
I was 27 and I'd just started my
first proper relationship,

1410
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:47,000
which is pretty old,
isn't it, really?

1411
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:51,960
I went out for dinner with George,
and he was very quiet on me.

1412
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,800
He goes, "Anselmo's got Aids."

1413
01:19:58,280 --> 01:19:59,520
Thank you very much.

1414
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:01,880
There's something I'd like to say.

1415
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:04,280
I think many of us have something
to say today.

1416
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:09,320
I couldn't believe he had found
someone to love.

1417
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:13,680
And now he was going to lose
that person.

1418
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:17,640
It was heartbreaking.

1419
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:22,640
The conservative estimate
for the year 2000

1420
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:28,080
is 40 million people on this planet
will be infected with HIV?

1421
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:33,640
And if you think, or any
of you out there, really think

1422
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:37,600
that those are all going to be gay
people or drug addicts,

1423
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:40,480
then you're pretty much lining up to
be one of those numbers.

1424
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:43,880
CROWD CHEERS

1425
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:50,520
So, please, for God's sake,
and for Freddie's sake,

1426
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:53,520
and for your own sakes,
please be careful.

1427
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,040
All right?

1428
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,800
Thank you very much.

1429
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:59,880
This song
is one of my favourites.

1430
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:02,000
It's called Somebody To Love.

1431
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,360
MUSIC: Somebody To Love

1432
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:12,120
# Each morning I get up
I die a little

1433
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:14,520
# Can barely stand on my feet

1434
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:15,840
# Take a look at yourself

1435
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:18,600
# Take a look in the mirror and cry

1436
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:19,720
# And cry

1437
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:22,000
# Lord, what you're doing to me

1438
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,160
# I have spent all my years
in believing you

1439
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:28,880
# But I just can't get no relief,
Lord!

1440
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:30,200
# Somebody
Somebody

1441
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:32,080
# Ooh, somebody
Somebody

1442
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:36,080
# Can anybody find me

1443
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:38,400
# Somebody to love...? #

1444
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:42,680
"Please God. I cry and cry.
Send me someone."

1445
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:45,280
And he did, but he was dying.

1446
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:49,760
I want to hear every single person.

1447
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:53,480
See every single pair of hands.

1448
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:55,120
Three, four!

1449
01:21:55,120 --> 01:22:01,520
# Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love

1450
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:03,680
# Find me somebody to love... #

1451
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:06,320
The sound of his voice is coming out
in the monitors all around me,

1452
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:09,600
and there were moments on that night
when we had that crystal clear

1453
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,680
razor edge just like Freddie.

1454
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:14,960
And it was a real
chills-up-the-spine moment

1455
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:16,240
for all of us.

1456
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:23,440
# Can anybody find me... #

1457
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:25,200
When he sings the chorus...

1458
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:28,320
# ..somebody to... #

1459
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:30,920
..and he puts the mic out
to the audience.

1460
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:32,120
Come on!

1461
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:33,400
Ah!

1462
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:36,920
AUDIENCE: Love!

1463
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:38,160
He spun around...

1464
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:39,200
Yeah!

1465
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:43,920
..cos he knew he had the audience.

1466
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:46,520
# Somebody to love... #

1467
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:52,520
I spoke to Anselmo after
the performance and I said to him,

1468
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:55,080
"You know that song was for you."

1469
01:22:56,080 --> 01:23:00,360
And he was like, "No, no."
I said, "Anselmo, that was yours."

1470
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:03,680
# Find me, fine me, find me... #

1471
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:09,520
And 11 months later, literally
to the day - we knew it was coming,

1472
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:12,640
of course we knew - he died.

1473
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:16,440
# Anybody, anywhere, anybody find me

1474
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:18,440
# Somebody to love

1475
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:20,320
# Yeah, yeah

1476
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:26,720
# Love! #

I think there is - I know there is

01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:58,760
that Freddie would be very proud to
have stand in his footsteps tonight.

Freddie opened up his heart

He lived for his music,
he loved his music.

01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:40,640
And he was proud of himself
as a musician above everything else.

'We are light years in terms
of treatment from where

1511
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:57,680
'we were because we have
the medication'

1512
01:25:57,680 --> 01:26:00,160
so I know I'm not going to die
tomorrow.

1513
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:05,160
But I still meet people who get
diagnosed, and it's devastating.

1514
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,880
I would say to them,

1515
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:10,600
"Know that there is a world
where you will be loved

1516
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:13,560
"and you'll be taken care
of without any judgment."

1517
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:19,160
The antidote to shame is light,
isn't it? Empathy.

1518
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:22,680
So if the secret stops being
a secret and everybody can see it,

1519
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:27,160
and we get some love and acceptance,
that is powerful.

1520
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:28,600
That is powerful.

1521
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:31,600
# Cos we are the champions... #

1522
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:34,560
I wish Freddie could have
seen that outpouring

1523
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:36,800
of love and acceptance.

1524
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,400
Thanks, Freddie!

1525
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:41,720
We just wanted to let you know
we were thinking about you.

1526
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:43,600
Stay safe!

1527
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:47,960
# ..of the world! #

1528
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:30,960
MUSIC: A Winter's Tale
by Queen

1529
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:32,240
Yeah, look at that intro.

1530
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:39,480
# Red skies are gleaming, oh... #

1531
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:44,560
When he was in Montreux, he sat
on the balcony and the view

1532
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:47,920
is amazing overlooking
the lake and the mountains

1533
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:49,720
and the chimney tops.

1534
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:51,560
# Smoking chimney-tops... #

1535
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:52,800
# Chimney tops. #

1536
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:53,960
# Am I dreaming? #

1537
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:55,600
# Am I dreaming? #

1538
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:58,160
# Am I dreaming? #

1539
01:27:58,160 --> 01:28:00,200
SHE HUMS ALONG

1540
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:04,360
That would have been the last song
that Freddie would have written

1541
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:05,640
before he died.

1542
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:07,840
# The nights draw in... #

1543
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:13,920
# There's a silky moon
up in the sky... #

1544
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:15,480
Yeah!
# Yeah... #

1545
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:19,680
Although his body was failing him,
his voice was so strong.

1546
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:22,280
# Am I dreaming? #

1547
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,680
# Am I dreaming?

1548
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:28,760
# Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa

1549
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:31,080
# Dreaming... #

1550
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:35,120
It must have been hard when you know
that you're going to die.

1551
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:37,800
How do you cope with that?

1552
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:41,080
By writing a lovely song, maybe.

1553
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:46,760
And it's lovely that he's left
this legacy for us all.

1554
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:48,520
# Dreaming

1555
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:50,720
# A breathtaking scene

1556
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:54,960
# With the dreams of the world

1557
01:28:54,960 --> 01:29:02,200
# In the palm of your hand. #

1558
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:04,400
MUSIC CONTINUES
