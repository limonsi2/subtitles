<i>All right, well, I'm sorry about that.</i>

638
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:12,500
<i>Listen, come on over to the house.</i>

639
00:33:12,583 --> 00:33:16,083
<i>Run some drills with him, maybe me.</i>
<i>I'll make dinner.</i>

<i>-[Sean] Mm-hmm.</i>

648
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:46,291
<i>I was a hell of a running back myself.</i>

<i>In '86, I was the man.</i>

650
00:33:49,708 --> 00:33:53,708

<i>But look, at the end of the day,</i>
<i>I'm the head coach,</i>

847

<i>to take responsibility.</i>

848
00:43:57,541 --> 00:44:00,250
<i>If you're taking responsibility,</i>

958
00:49:19,041 --> 00:49:21,416
<i>Okay. I'm gonna do it, Coach.</i>

959
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,416
<i>All right. That's my boy. Go get 'em.</i>

960
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,166
<i>[Jason] Line it up. Let's go.</i>

961
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:26,958
<i>-Think he's gonna do it?</i>
<i>-Nope.</i>

962
00:49:27,458 --> 00:49:29,708
<i>He looks even more scared</i>
<i>than the last time.</i>

963
00:49:29,791 --> 00:49:31,958
<i>I know. What a little wussy.</i>

964
00:49:32,041 --> 00:49:34,208
<i>Come on! Let's go, Warriors!</i>

965

<i>-[boy] Hut!</i>
-<i>[commentator] </i>The ball is snapped.

<i>Yeah. I was, uh… I was… I was out there.</i>

975
00:49:59,458 --> 00:50:01,166
<i>Yes, I saw you.</i>

976

<i>You said it would take some time,</i>
<i>and it did,</i>

<i>You know, when I was a kid,</i>
<i>I idolized my father so much.</i>

980

<i>Then, when I was eight, they got divorced.</i>

981
00:50:14,208 --> 00:50:17,416
<i>My dad moved out.</i>
<i>I resented him so much. I…</i>

982
00:50:18,125 --> 00:50:20,750
<i>He used to call the house.</i>
<i>I wouldn't even pick up the phone.</i>

983
00:50:21,666 --> 00:50:23,666
<i>He'd come by outside school, and I…</i>

984
00:50:24,916 --> 00:50:27,833
<i>I'd walk right by him</i>
<i>and not even acknowledge him.</i>

985
00:50:27,916 --> 00:50:29,375
<i>I know that must've hurt him.</i>

986
00:50:32,041 --> 00:50:33,666
<i>So when did you guys reconnect?</i>

987
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:35,000
<i>Oh, we never did.</i>

988
00:50:35,625 --> 00:50:39,416
<i>Yeah. He could be dead by now.</i>
<i>It was 30 years ago, but…</i>

989
00:50:40,125 --> 00:50:41,958
<i>Anyway, good game today.</i>

990
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:45,500
<i>Uh, why… Why would you tell me that story?</i>

991
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:50,916
<i>You're wearing the same cologne as he did,</i>
<i>and it just reminded me of him.</i>

992
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,083
<i>I-I don't wear cologne.</i>

993
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,666
<i>Oh. My bad. [chuckles] Sorry about that.</i>

994
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:01,666
<i>I just thought…</i>

995

<i>I-I got a whiff of something, and I…</i>
<i>I just spilled my maté.</i>

<i>[Beth] It's okay.</i>

997
00:51:07,333 --> 00:51:08,416

<i>-Come on in.</i>
<i>-[Sean] Thank you for having me.</i>

1003
00:51:20,041 --> 00:51:22,041
<i>Oh, and you brought a tiny cake.</i>

1004
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:27,583
<i>Hey there, buddy. What you working on?</i>

1005
00:51:27,666 --> 00:51:29,958
<i>-Oh, Spanish.</i>
<i>-</i>Bueno.

1006
00:51:30,041 --> 00:51:30,875
<i>Huh?</i>

1007
00:51:32,291 --> 00:51:35,708
<i>I hope you like Pinot Grigio.</i>
<i>We drink a lot of it.</i>

1008

<i>"We"?</i>

1009
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,208
<i>Well, just me.</i>
<i>Makes it more fun around here.</i>

1010
00:51:42,291 --> 00:51:44,708
<i>You know, I-I think I'm good on the wine.</i>

1011
00:51:44,791 --> 00:51:48,250
<i>You know, we got a big game tomorrow.</i>
<i>Right, Dennis? The Porcupines.</i>

1012
00:51:48,333 --> 00:51:50,791
<i>They've been league champs</i>
<i>for four years in a row.</i>

1013
00:51:50,875 --> 00:51:52,750
<i>Hope they don't humiliate us too bad.</i>

<i>[Cindy clears throat]</i>

1019

<i>But I sense a lot of pain</i>
<i>underneath that jovial exterior.</i>

1020
00:52:15,166 --> 00:52:17,083
<i>Was it a rough breakup with Beth?</i>

1021
00:52:17,166 --> 00:52:19,166
<i>It was… It was just one of those things.</i>

1022
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:20,791
<i>Oh, I see.</i>

1023
00:52:21,291 --> 00:52:25,250
<i>Yeah, those skinny girls</i>
<i>can never handle a strong, robust man.</i>

1024

<i>They snap like a twig under real pressure.</i>

1025
00:52:29,625 --> 00:52:32,041
<i>I don't think we should talk about it</i>
<i>in front of Dennis.</i>

1026

<i>-Dennis, go to your room.</i>
<i>-But I'm hungry.</i>

<i>You always hungry.</i>

1028
00:52:35,875 --> 00:52:40,625
<i>I'm pretty hungry too. It smells amazing.</i>
<i>So why don't we, uh, get to dinner, huh?</i>

1029
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:43,125
<i>You should see how I do on breakfast.</i>

1030
00:52:44,708 --> 00:52:45,708
<i>Oh, hold on now.</i>

1031
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:47,875
<i>Oh, eyelash stuck. Hold on.</i>

1032
00:52:47,958 --> 00:52:51,166
<i>Let me just see if I can just</i>
<i>put my fingernail up in there.</i>

1033
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:53,500
<i>And, nope. Damn it. I can't get it open.</i>

1034

00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:45,375
<i>Hey, change the channel, would you?</i>

1114
00:56:46,333 --> 00:56:47,791
<i>Doesn't get any worse than that--</i>

1115
00:56:47,875 --> 00:56:50,541
<i>Ouch. Maybe Payton's lost his magic touch.</i>

1116
00:56:50,625 --> 00:56:53,416
<i>It makes you wonder</i>
<i>if the Saints will even bring him back.</i>

1117
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:55,708
<i>Maybe they'll hire</i>
<i>the coach from the Porcupines.</i>

1118
00:56:55,791 --> 00:56:58,250
<i>That Porcupines coach is pretty good.</i>

1119
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:00,916
<i>Has some funny zingers.</i>

1120
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,333
<i>Like, one time at a gas station,</i>

1121
00:57:03,416 --> 00:57:07,791
<i>he told me I looked like</i>
<i>if Ellen DeGeneres and a robot had a baby.</i>

1122
00:57:07,875 --> 00:57:09,125
<i>So good.</i>

1123
00:57:12,166 --> 00:57:13,125
<i>God.</i>

1124
00:57:19,833 --> 00:57:23,500
<i>Payton, maybe it's time to give Marcos</i>
<i>another chance at QB? What do you say?</i>

1125
00:57:23,583 --> 00:57:26,833
<i>Hey, Calvin. Funny, I didn't hear from you</i>
<i>when we won six straight.</i>

1126
00:57:26,916 --> 00:57:29,500
<i>Yeah, and Paulie's tired</i>
<i>of getting kicked in the ass too.</i>

1127
00:57:29,583 --> 00:57:31,958
<i>All right. I forgot my notebook</i>
<i>on the sidelines.</i>

1128
00:57:32,041 --> 00:57:34,333
<i>Let me go grab it</i>
<i>so I can write some notes down.</i>

1129
00:57:34,833 --> 00:57:37,166
<i>-Oh. Okay.</i>
<i>-Thanks for considering that.</i>

1130
00:57:42,791 --> 00:57:45,250
<i>-You mind if I address the whole team?</i>
<i>-Be my guest.</i>

1131
00:57:45,833 --> 00:57:47,083
<i>[whistle blows]</i>

1132
00:57:47,166 --> 00:57:48,333
<i>Everybody, take a knee.</i>

1133
00:57:52,041 --> 00:57:53,791
<i>That was a bad loss.</i>

1134
00:57:54,416 --> 00:57:56,291
<i>We are going to get our revenge.</i>

1135
00:57:56,375 --> 00:57:57,916
<i>We don't play them again.</i>

1136
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:58,958
<i>Oh, thank God.</i>

1137
00:57:59,458 --> 00:58:03,375
<i>We play them again in 27 days.</i>
<i>In the championship game.</i>

1138
00:58:03,458 --> 00:58:05,875
<i>I know they're gonna be</i>
<i>at the championship game,</i>

1139

1140

<i>-We'd have to win the rest of our games.</i>
<i>-That's right, Jason.</i>

1141
00:58:11,208 --> 00:58:13,875
<i>You guys know what Drew Brees does</i>
<i>after every game?</i>

1142
00:58:14,916 --> 00:58:18,791
<i>When everybody else has gone home,</i>
<i>Drew stays on the field,</i>

1143
00:58:18,875 --> 00:58:21,250
<i>and he runs through</i>
<i>the progressions in his head</i>

1144
00:58:22,083 --> 00:58:23,916
<i>to see what he could've done better.</i>

1145
00:58:24,416 --> 00:58:26,625
<i>That's what separates him from the rest.</i>

1146
00:58:27,208 --> 00:58:29,000
<i>That's how you become great.</i>

1147
00:58:29,583 --> 00:58:30,958
<i>You think we can beat 'em, Dad?</i>

1148

<i>We're not only gonna beat 'em,</i>

1149
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,583
<i>we're gonna shut the scoreboard off.</i>
<i>How about that?</i>

1150
00:58:35,666 --> 00:58:36,583
<i>Yeah, boys.</i>

1151
00:58:37,208 --> 00:58:38,291
<i>[all] Yeah!</i>

1152
00:58:39,416 --> 00:58:43,375
<i>Last Saturday,</i>
<i>I saw a team get beat mentally!</i>

1153
00:58:44,958 --> 00:58:46,000
<i>I saw guys quitting!</i>

1154
00:58:46,583 --> 00:58:48,958
<i>I saw guys not at their physical best.</i>

1155
00:58:49,041 --> 00:58:51,291
<i>So how do we bring that to the next level?</i>

1156
00:58:51,875 --> 00:58:52,916
<i>I'll tell you how.</i>

1157
00:58:54,083 --> 00:58:56,458
<i>We start running laps. Go! [whistle blows]</i>

1158

<i>He wasn't talking about me quitting</i>
<i>and not being my physical best, was he?</i>

1159
00:59:08,666 --> 00:59:11,250
<i>He wasn't,</i>
<i>but a couple of laps wouldn't hurt.</i>

<i>Listen up, guys.</i>

1169
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:49,875
<i>We need to address our weakest link,</i>

1170

<i>-[Paulie] My butt hurts, man.</i>

<i>I-I'm coaching my son's team,</i>

<i>and we-we're coming up against an offense</i>
<i>I've never seen before.</i>

1311
01:07:55,708 --> 01:07:57,125
<i>Okay, what's it look like?</i>

1312
01:07:57,208 --> 01:08:00,458
<i>They got four backs,</i>
<i>an unbalanced lineman, and it just--</i>

1313
01:08:00,541 --> 01:08:01,833
<i>[coach] </i>Single wing.

1314
01:08:01,916 --> 01:08:05,375
<i>The Steelers used to use this</i>

<i>up until the early '50s.</i>

1316

<i>For the life of me, I can't figure it out.</i>

1317
01:08:08,791 --> 01:08:12,083
<i>Easy. Take your wide receivers</i>
<i>and make them linebackers.</i>

1318
01:08:12,666 --> 01:08:14,833
<i>-Okay.</i>
<i>-[coach] </i>This is not about skill set.

1319
01:08:14,916 --> 01:08:16,041
<i>It's about speed.</i>

1320
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:19,708
<i>By the way, if you lose,</i>
<i>do not tell anybody that I helped you.</i>

1321
01:08:19,791 --> 01:08:21,916
<i>-[chuckles] Yeah, I promise.</i>
-<i>[coach] </i>Good.

1322
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,708
<i>The other thing</i>
<i>you have to focus on is this.</i>

1323
01:08:23,791 --> 01:08:26,750
<i>You're taking offensive players</i>
<i>to defense…</i>

1324

<i>and the Argyle Warriors.</i>

1330

<i>Captains to the center.</i>

1331
01:08:52,416 --> 01:08:54,041
<i>That's far enough. For the toss,</i>

1332
01:08:54,125 --> 01:08:57,958
<i>we'll be using the North Central</i>
<i>Texas Championship commemorative coin.</i>

1333
01:08:58,041 --> 01:08:59,791
<i>Warriors, call it in the air.</i>

1334
01:08:59,875 --> 01:09:00,750
<i>Tails.</i>

<i>-Receive.</i>

<i>And away we go.</i>

<i>Remember the feeling you had</i>
<i>after we lost to these guys.</i>

1340
01:09:20,791 --> 01:09:23,250
<i>A lot of times,</i>
<i>we don't get a shot at redemption.</i>

1341
01:09:24,166 --> 01:09:26,125
<i>In the NFL, you lose to a team,</i>

1342
01:09:26,208 --> 01:09:28,166
<i>you may not see them</i>
<i>for the rest of the season.</i>

1343

<i>for another year.</i>

<i>by showing them exactly who we are.</i>

<i>I can do both. Here's the deal.</i>

1391
01:11:25,375 --> 01:11:28,083
<i>To beat the single wing,</i>
<i>we gotta do this with speed.</i>

1392
01:11:28,166 --> 01:11:31,208
<i>We're gonna take our two fastest players,</i>
<i>Connor and Marcos,</i>

1393

<i>and we're gonna put you guys</i>
<i>as defensive ends--</i>
