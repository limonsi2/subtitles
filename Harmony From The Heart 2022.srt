I'm his doctor.

With music?

198
00:08:24,602 --> 00:08:25,937
Music therapy has shown

199
00:08:25,937 --> 00:08:29,043
to have so many positive
healing effects on patients‐‐

200
00:08:29,043 --> 00:08:31,649
from lowered blood pressure
to improved memory.

201

203
00:08:34,655 --> 00:08:37,728
Yeah, which, clearly, has
not been working for Charles.

204
00:08:37,728 --> 00:08:39,164
Is that right?

205
00:08:39,164 --> 00:08:41,101
And music's gonna make
all the difference?

00:08:41,101 --> 00:08:43,840
‐Absolutely.
‐I'll believe it when I see it.

because you can't find a date
for Valentine's Day.

364
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:19,618
See, you spend too much time
in that chocolate shop, buddy.

365
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,956
What's this?

366
00:16:21,956 --> 00:16:25,028
Rose petal‐infused truffles.

367
00:16:25,028 --> 00:16:27,601
[host] And the last carnation
after a word from our sponsors.

368
00:16:27,601 --> 00:16:29,103
[Desiree] <i>Oh, come on!</i>

369
00:16:29,103 --> 00:16:31,709
They always cut right before
the last carnation.

370
00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:34,715
Okay, catch me up
on your new patient.

371
00:16:34,715 --> 00:16:36,652
I mean, I don't
usually get nervous

372
00:16:36,652 --> 00:16:37,954
about these sorts of things,

373
00:16:37,954 --> 00:16:40,125
but between Professor Carver
and Mary Anne,

374
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,862
it's a lot of pressure.

375
00:16:41,862 --> 00:16:44,433
I basically promised them
a miracle by Valentine's Day.

376
00:16:44,433 --> 00:16:46,437
I hope I'm not in over my head.

377
00:16:46,437 --> 00:16:48,341
No way. You're brilliant.

378
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,445
Dr. Blake Williams
doesn't think so.

379
00:16:51,347 --> 00:16:53,886
Who's Dr. Blake Williams?

380
00:16:53,886 --> 00:16:55,122
<i>He sounds handsome.</i>

381
00:16:55,122 --> 00:16:57,259
He's just this guy who thinks
that he's better than me

382
00:16:57,259 --> 00:16:58,963
because he knows
how to use a scalpel

383
00:16:58,963 --> 00:17:00,098
instead of a piano.

384
00:17:00,098 --> 00:17:03,271
Hey, did you hear that Grandpa
is doing music therapy?

385
00:17:03,271 --> 00:17:05,777
Mm. Don't remind me.

386
00:17:05,777 --> 00:17:08,716
All right? This "therapist"
is overly‐idealistic,

387
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:11,522
and she's gonna make Grandpa's
recovery ten times harder.

388
00:17:11,522 --> 00:17:13,592
It sounds like
this music therapist

389
00:17:13,592 --> 00:17:15,730
has really gotten
under your skin, huh?

390
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,601
Not really.

391
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:19,370
He is arrogant and difficult,

392
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,875
and he is making my job
twice as hard.

393
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,380
Sounds like you really care what
this Dr. Blake thinks.

394
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,050
No, I don't care
what he thinks.

395
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,522
I care that he ruined my day.

396
00:17:28,522 --> 00:17:29,691
And my pedicure.

397
00:17:29,691 --> 00:17:30,960
Well, if he's got
a cute brother,

398
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,829
just let me know.

399
00:17:31,829 --> 00:17:33,398
Anyway, it's like
what my grandma said,

400
00:17:33,398 --> 00:17:36,237
you know,
tomorrow is a new day.

401
00:17:36,237 --> 00:17:37,473
Hey. You got plans next week?

402
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,943
Working with
the music therapist

403
00:17:38,943 --> 00:17:39,978
in the mornings.

404
00:17:39,978 --> 00:17:41,849
Only a couple of surgeries
on deck. Why?

405
00:17:41,849 --> 00:17:43,586
I need you to come by the shop
and help me out.

406
00:17:43,586 --> 00:17:45,990
I'm drowning in orders.

407
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:49,030
Why do people get so crazy
about Valentine's Day?

408
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,165
You're only saying that

409
00:17:50,165 --> 00:17:52,169
because you've had your heart
broken too many times.

410
00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:55,008
You can't stay Stockbridge's
most‐eligible bachelor forever.

411
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:57,479
No, I believe that title
belongs to you.

412
00:17:57,479 --> 00:17:58,649
[laughs] Yeah.

413
00:17:58,649 --> 00:18:00,419
And I think this is gonna
this is your year‐‐

414
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:02,256
this is gonna be the year

415
00:18:02,256 --> 00:18:04,126
that you find
your soulmate, Maxey.

416
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:05,630
Really?

417
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,701
Oh, absolutely.

418
00:18:07,701 --> 00:18:09,805
Oh, my gosh, it's back on.

419
00:18:09,805 --> 00:18:13,311
[host] <i>... who are you going</i>
<i>to promise forever?</i>

420
00:18:13,311 --> 00:18:14,881
Lauren A
is definitely going home.

421
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,679
[engine rumbles off]

422
00:18:26,817 --> 00:18:29,222
Hello.

423
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:31,326
Morning.

424
00:18:31,326 --> 00:18:34,199
So, uh, I got to get back
to the hospital

425
00:18:34,199 --> 00:18:36,603
for surgery
in a couple hours, so.

426
00:18:36,603 --> 00:18:37,638
Sounds serious.

427
00:18:37,638 --> 00:18:39,275
Are you sure you shouldn't
get going right now?

428
00:18:39,275 --> 00:18:41,213
You know, as much as I would
love to miss music class,

429
00:18:41,213 --> 00:18:42,849
I love my grandfather too much

430
00:18:42,849 --> 00:18:44,185
to leave him
in questionable hands.

431
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,790
"Questionable hands."

432
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,494
Do you know
the steadiness of hand

433
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,364
that it takes
to play Stravinsky?

434
00:18:50,364 --> 00:18:51,700
Let's just get
this over with.

435
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,704
Let's.

436
00:18:53,704 --> 00:18:55,007
I spoke to Mary Anne

437
00:18:55,007 --> 00:18:56,476
and I thought we would
change up the environment.

438
00:18:56,476 --> 00:18:58,180
Hi, Grandpa.

439
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,284
How are you feeling today?

440
00:19:01,853 --> 00:19:05,327
So, I thought, instead of
just jumping into making music,

441
00:19:05,327 --> 00:19:08,534
I thought that maybe we could
listen to some music.

442
00:19:08,534 --> 00:19:10,304
Huh?

443
00:19:10,304 --> 00:19:12,976
Music memory has the power
to unlock muscle memory.

444
00:19:12,976 --> 00:19:15,414
Okay. Breathe in, Grandpa.

445
00:19:15,414 --> 00:19:16,449
[deep breath]

446
00:19:16,449 --> 00:19:17,485
Breathe out.

447
00:19:17,485 --> 00:19:18,687
[exhales deeply]

448
00:19:18,687 --> 00:19:19,889
You're a little congested.

449
00:19:19,889 --> 00:19:21,693
I'll ask Grandma
to make you some hot tea.

450
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:24,132
Earl Grey, right?

451
00:19:24,132 --> 00:19:26,303
Musical vibrations
can also boost immunity.

452
00:19:26,303 --> 00:19:28,540
The tea should do the trick.

453
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,377
[zips bag up]

454
00:19:32,315 --> 00:19:34,052
Wow...

455
00:19:34,052 --> 00:19:35,487
Look at all the records.

456
00:19:37,725 --> 00:19:39,095
Is this you?

457
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:42,735
Grandpa was pretty famous
in the local scene.

458
00:19:42,735 --> 00:19:46,343
He would have made it big
if the label hadn't gone under.

459
00:19:46,343 --> 00:19:50,050
But his instrument business
did pretty well, huh, Gramps?

460
00:19:52,021 --> 00:19:53,992
[jazz music playing]

461
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:57,131
[♪♪♪♪♪]

462
00:20:01,106 --> 00:20:03,510
[♪♪♪♪♪]

463
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,660
[♪♪♪♪♪]

464
00:20:17,405 --> 00:20:19,375
[♪♪♪♪♪]

465
00:20:22,582 --> 00:20:24,319
Today was good.

466
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:26,723
He didn't seem to hate it.

467
00:20:29,997 --> 00:20:32,768
A doctor with a motorcycle?

468
00:20:32,768 --> 00:20:33,770
Is there a problem?

469
00:20:34,974 --> 00:20:36,910
No. Just doesn't seem
like the best idea

470
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,347
for someone
who works at a hospital.

471
00:20:38,347 --> 00:20:40,117
All right.

472
00:20:40,952 --> 00:20:42,455
See you tomorrow.

473
00:20:42,455 --> 00:20:43,857
Unfortunately.

474
00:20:43,857 --> 00:20:45,160
[engine revs]

475
00:21:00,691 --> 00:21:02,561
Good morning, Lucille.

476
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:04,599
Looks like we made it
just on time.

477
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:05,401
Is the physio room ready?

478
00:21:05,401 --> 00:21:07,338
‐It sure is.
‐Okay, Grandpa.

479
00:21:07,338 --> 00:21:09,475
Morning, Charles. Blake.

480
00:21:09,475 --> 00:21:11,313
What can we do for you, Violet?

481
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:13,250
Nothing. I just heard
from Mrs. Carver

482
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,054
that you changed Charles'
physical‐therapy appointment

483
00:21:15,054 --> 00:21:16,156
to this morning.

484
00:21:16,156 --> 00:21:18,460
Yeah, there was
a last‐minute opening.

485
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,531
Yeah, but it's my time
with him,

486
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:23,136
so maybe you'd like some music
to accompany your physio?

487
00:21:23,136 --> 00:21:24,305
No, I'm sorry,

488
00:21:24,305 --> 00:21:27,178
but this is a doctor‐and‐patient
only session.

489
00:21:27,178 --> 00:21:29,382
Come on, Grandpa.
Let's go.

490
00:21:30,284 --> 00:21:33,190
It's just down here.

491
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,392
You all right?

492
00:21:40,904 --> 00:21:43,176
[doorbell chimes]

493
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:45,314
Oh. Flowers and chocolate.

494
00:21:45,314 --> 00:21:47,485
Yup.

495
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,422
[gasps]

496
00:21:49,422 --> 00:21:51,126
‐Grandma. These are for you.
‐What?

497
00:21:51,126 --> 00:21:53,063
Oh, thank you!
Sweet. Mm.

498
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:54,399
Come on in.

499
00:21:54,399 --> 00:21:55,567
Ahh.

500
00:21:55,567 --> 00:21:57,071
So thoughtful.

501
00:21:57,071 --> 00:21:59,242
[whispers] If you really
want to win her over,

502
00:21:59,242 --> 00:22:01,479
she's a huge Emily Bronte fan.

503
00:22:16,876 --> 00:22:18,613
Ahh.

504
00:22:20,117 --> 00:22:23,457
What‐‐
What are you doing here?

505
00:22:23,457 --> 00:22:24,926
My grandmother told me
you were buying records

506
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,229
for Grandpa Charlie.

507
00:22:26,229 --> 00:22:27,932
I'm here to vet them.

508
00:22:27,932 --> 00:22:29,302
You're joking.

509
00:22:29,302 --> 00:22:30,871
Grandma wanted me
to invite you to dinner

510
00:22:30,871 --> 00:22:32,174
with the family tonight.

511
00:22:33,076 --> 00:22:34,445
Really?

512
00:22:34,445 --> 00:22:36,549
Well, unless, of course,
you're busy.

513
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:39,856
No. I mean,
that's really nice of her.

514
00:22:39,856 --> 00:22:41,292
‐Ah.
‐I'll be there.

515
00:22:46,836 --> 00:22:48,540
Do you even like music?

516
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,210
My grandpa
was a jazz musician.

517
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:51,446
I love music.

518
00:22:51,446 --> 00:22:53,350
I just don't believe
in music as medicine.

519
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,521
Okay.
So who's your favorite band?

520
00:22:55,521 --> 00:22:56,623
I don't have
a favorite band.

521
00:22:56,623 --> 00:22:58,326
Because you don't really
like music.

522
00:22:58,326 --> 00:23:00,264
No, because
I like solo artists.

523
00:23:00,264 --> 00:23:01,566
Hendrix. Janice Joplin.

524
00:23:01,566 --> 00:23:03,070
Paul Simon.

525
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:06,342
Paul Simon was half of a duo
before he became a solo artist.

526
00:23:06,342 --> 00:23:08,280
Everyone knows
Simon was better on his own.

527
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,415
I disagree!

528
00:23:09,415 --> 00:23:10,884
All of his best songs
were with Garfunkel.

529
00:23:11,954 --> 00:23:13,123
"Bridge Over Troubled Water,"

530
00:23:13,123 --> 00:23:15,160
"Sound of Silence,"
"Mrs. Robinson."

531
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:19,869
Well, I am buying Grandpa
a Paul Simon record.

532
00:23:19,869 --> 00:23:21,639
Or, I mean, we could compromise

533
00:23:21,639 --> 00:23:24,011
and get him a collection
of greatest‐‐

534
00:23:24,011 --> 00:23:25,949
...love songs?

535
00:23:32,428 --> 00:23:35,067
Wow, Mary Anne,
this looks delicious.

536
00:23:35,067 --> 00:23:37,404
Oh, it's actually
my mother's recipe.

537
00:23:37,404 --> 00:23:39,776
She always said the fastest way
to a man's heart

538
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,911
was through his stomach.

539
00:23:40,911 --> 00:23:43,350
Medically untrue.

540
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:45,654
But that was interesting,
because, as it turned out,

541
00:23:45,654 --> 00:23:47,258
I was hopeless in the kitchen.

542
00:23:47,258 --> 00:23:49,662
I clearly did not inherit
the cooking gene,

543
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:50,631
like our Max did.

544
00:23:50,631 --> 00:23:52,134
That's right!

545
00:23:52,134 --> 00:23:53,938
[laughing]

546
00:23:53,938 --> 00:23:56,176
But, luckily enough,

547
00:23:56,176 --> 00:23:57,578
Charles didn't seem to mind.

548
00:23:57,578 --> 00:24:00,083
He was happy just to go out
for dinner,

549
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:03,323
especially if
there was live music.

550
00:24:03,323 --> 00:24:07,665
Our very first date

551
00:24:07,665 --> 00:24:10,170
was at this quaint
little jazz club

552
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:11,473
in Stockbridge.

553
00:24:11,473 --> 00:24:13,210
Wow. Living on the edge,
Grandma.

554
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:14,980
Hey. Hey!

555
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,251
And right
in the middle of dinner,

556
00:24:17,251 --> 00:24:19,589
he was invited up
onto the stage‐‐

557
00:24:19,589 --> 00:24:22,996
to...
to play the saxophone.

558
00:24:22,996 --> 00:24:24,765
‐[laughing]
‐I mean...

559
00:24:24,765 --> 00:24:28,073
I didn't know what...

560
00:24:28,073 --> 00:24:30,010
it turned out
it was his band!

561
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,047
[laughing]

562
00:24:32,047 --> 00:24:33,650
It was all a set‐up.

563
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:36,256
It was so sweet.

564
00:24:36,256 --> 00:24:39,162
Oh, I was so...

565
00:24:39,162 --> 00:24:40,664
enamored.

566
00:24:42,501 --> 00:24:44,105
Ah.

567
00:24:44,105 --> 00:24:46,075
What song were they playing?

568
00:24:46,075 --> 00:24:47,912
Um...

569
00:24:47,912 --> 00:24:49,615
It... "It Had to Be You."

570
00:24:53,023 --> 00:24:55,561
Yeah. "It Had to Be You."

571
00:24:58,066 --> 00:24:59,368
Aw, Blake.

572
00:24:59,368 --> 00:25:03,543
Is that why you used to sing
that song with your band?

573
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,147
Wait! You had a band?

574
00:25:05,147 --> 00:25:06,749
No, no.
It wasn't a serious band.

575
00:25:06,749 --> 00:25:09,288
It was just a group of us
from Doctors Without Borders

576
00:25:09,288 --> 00:25:12,027
doing covers
for the locals in Belarus.

577
00:25:12,027 --> 00:25:13,663
Did this band have a name?

578
00:25:17,004 --> 00:25:18,607
It was the, uh...

579
00:25:18,607 --> 00:25:19,575
[mutters] ...it was
"the Heartmenders."

580
00:25:19,575 --> 00:25:21,579
‐What?
‐Come again?

581
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,752
"The Heartmenders."

582
00:25:24,752 --> 00:25:26,489
‐[laughing]
‐That's what it was!

583
00:25:26,489 --> 00:25:27,791
‐Heartmenders.
‐It was!

584
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:28,995
He was wonderful.

585
00:25:28,995 --> 00:25:32,468
Wow. Is there a solo career
in your future, Mr. Simon?

586
00:25:32,468 --> 00:25:35,073
No. No. I'm retired.

587
00:25:35,073 --> 00:25:37,344
So what about you, Violet? Huh?

588
00:25:37,344 --> 00:25:39,215
You have a‐‐ a musical family?

589
00:25:39,215 --> 00:25:40,584
I do, yeah.

590
00:25:40,584 --> 00:25:43,290
As a little girl,
I was raised by my grandmother,

591
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:45,227
and there was always music
through the house.

592
00:25:45,227 --> 00:25:47,231
She had
the most beautiful voice.

593
00:25:47,231 --> 00:25:49,335
I still feel like
she's watching over me.

594
00:25:49,335 --> 00:25:50,904
[Mary Anne] Oh, that's so sweet.

595
00:25:52,875 --> 00:25:55,914
Uh... I would like
to make a toast.

596
00:25:55,914 --> 00:25:58,053
Oh.

597
00:25:59,121 --> 00:26:00,057
To...

598
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:03,563
‐...The Heartmenders.
‐Of course.

599
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:06,469
‐[laughing]
‐To The Heartmenders.

600
00:26:12,414 --> 00:26:14,285
[indistinct exchange]

601
00:26:14,285 --> 00:26:15,654
Here's your coat.

602
00:26:15,654 --> 00:26:16,856
Thanks.

603
00:26:16,856 --> 00:26:18,593
You know, that was nice,
what you said‐‐

604
00:26:18,593 --> 00:26:20,497
about your grandmother?

605
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:22,534
I was raised
by my grandparents, too.

606
00:26:24,805 --> 00:26:27,278
So, do The Heartmenders
have an upcoming show?

607
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:28,747
[laughs] Very funny.

608
00:26:28,747 --> 00:26:30,917
‐I know the lead singer‐‐
‐All right, all right.

609
00:26:30,917 --> 00:26:32,454
...so I don't want them
to sell out of tickets.

610
00:26:32,454 --> 00:26:33,623
You know?

611
00:26:33,623 --> 00:26:35,127
Maybe a backstage pass.

612
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:36,496
If you play your cards right.

613
00:26:36,496 --> 00:26:38,600
[cell phone chiming]

614
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,270
Des. What's up?

615
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,775
I have a flower emergency!

616
00:26:42,775 --> 00:26:44,545
An order just came in
for a wedding‐‐

617
00:26:44,545 --> 00:26:45,614
their florist fell through.

618
00:26:45,614 --> 00:26:47,418
I am already up to my neck
in baby's breath

619
00:26:47,418 --> 00:26:48,920
with everything
I have to prepare

620
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,357
for Valentine's Day,

621
00:26:50,357 --> 00:26:52,628
and I just‐‐ I do not
have enough hands

622
00:26:52,628 --> 00:26:53,663
<i>to assemble</i>
<i>the wedding flowers in time.</i>

623
00:26:53,663 --> 00:26:55,000
Okay. All right. Don't panic.

624
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,836
I will be there in...

625
00:26:56,836 --> 00:26:57,973
Two hours?

626
00:26:57,973 --> 00:26:59,542
Oh, my...

627
00:26:59,542 --> 00:27:01,245
I'll be there soon.

628
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:02,715
Ah, you're the best.

629
00:27:02,715 --> 00:27:05,354
Really soon. Okay. Bye.

630
00:27:05,354 --> 00:27:06,756
You know, there's a game
tonight, Violet.

631
00:27:06,756 --> 00:27:08,693
You'll get there
a lot faster on a bike.

632
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:10,797
Yeah. No.

633
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:12,568
[laughs] What, are you scared?

634
00:27:12,568 --> 00:27:15,807
No, I'm not scared.

635
00:27:22,595 --> 00:27:24,066
[Blake]
You're pretty good at this.

636
00:27:24,066 --> 00:27:26,671
Ah. Weddings. So romantic.

637
00:27:26,671 --> 00:27:29,543
Hey, this reminds me of
that episode of <i>The Single Man,</i>

638
00:27:29,543 --> 00:27:32,515
when he surprised Lauren G
on a date on a hot‐air balloon

639
00:27:32,515 --> 00:27:34,353
filled with flowers
and, oh!

640
00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:37,025
Poor Lauren A did not
appreciate that gesture.

641
00:27:37,025 --> 00:27:38,862
That show is such a racket.

642
00:27:38,862 --> 00:27:41,701
I mean, they know each other
for what, two weeks?

643
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,571
All of a sudden, they're
supposed to fall in love?

644
00:27:43,571 --> 00:27:45,308
That doesn't happen
in real life.

645
00:27:47,112 --> 00:27:48,782
Dr. Williams here
is a realist.

646
00:27:48,782 --> 00:27:49,751
That's right.

647
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,353
He doesn't believe
in what he can't see.

648
00:27:51,353 --> 00:27:54,159
Love... musical therapy.

649
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:55,629
I believe in love,
all right?

650
00:27:55,629 --> 00:27:58,434
I just don't believe
in Valentine's Day.

651
00:27:58,434 --> 00:28:01,040
You know, the flowers,
the chocolates,

652
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,845
the flying baby
with a bow and arrow

653
00:28:03,845 --> 00:28:06,150
he menacingly points
at unsuspecting singles.

654
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:08,087
Okay.
Leave Cupid out of this.

655
00:28:08,087 --> 00:28:11,126
I personally
love Valentine's Day.

656
00:28:11,126 --> 00:28:12,663
It's the one day a year

657
00:28:12,663 --> 00:28:14,934
you get to unapologetically show
people how much you love them,

658
00:28:14,934 --> 00:28:18,007
with flowers and...

659
00:28:18,007 --> 00:28:19,443
[sighs dreamily]
...oh, chocolate.

660
00:28:19,443 --> 00:28:21,848
Maybe I should start
loading these in the truck.

661
00:28:21,848 --> 00:28:23,117
Mm‐hmm.

662
00:28:23,117 --> 00:28:25,254
Excuse me.

663
00:28:26,256 --> 00:28:27,860
Side bar‐‐
I approve.

664
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,262
What do you mean?

665
00:28:29,262 --> 00:28:31,868
Oh, you two
are perfect for each other.

666
00:28:31,868 --> 00:28:32,970
What?

667
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:35,174
No! No.

668
00:28:35,174 --> 00:28:36,678
Yeah, you
with your big heart,

669
00:28:36,678 --> 00:28:40,218
him with his cool exterior,
just waiting to be loved.

670
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,957
Yeah, you know what?
Actually, it's perfect.

671
00:28:42,957 --> 00:28:45,929
Except for the fact that
we cannot stand each other.

672
00:28:45,929 --> 00:28:47,900
Hey, he drove you
all the way from Stockbridge

673
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,871
and he stuck around to help.

674
00:28:51,073 --> 00:28:54,146
I think you're just
a hopeless romantic.

675
00:28:54,146 --> 00:28:56,450
Oh. "Hopeful romantic."

676
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:57,787
Hopeful.

677
00:28:57,787 --> 00:29:00,124
Who knows? Maybe
I should start planning

678
00:29:00,124 --> 00:29:03,097
your floral arrangement
for your wedding.

679
00:29:03,097 --> 00:29:04,132
So?

680
00:29:04,132 --> 00:29:06,905
We all set?

681
00:29:06,905 --> 00:29:08,842
Yep. Yep, yep.

682
00:29:08,842 --> 00:29:12,048
I think we've accomplished
everything we needed to tonight.

683
00:29:12,048 --> 00:29:15,656
Yeah. And you know what?

684
00:29:15,656 --> 00:29:17,860
Here you go.

685
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,096
"O Fish Ally Single Mixer."

686
00:29:19,096 --> 00:29:21,033
Valentine's Day Eve?

687
00:29:21,033 --> 00:29:22,368
That's a thing?

688
00:29:22,368 --> 00:29:24,206
Oh, I'm making it a thing.

689
00:29:24,206 --> 00:29:27,680
Now you've been
cordially invited.

690
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,547
Who knows?

691
00:29:28,547 --> 00:29:30,886
Maybe Cupid will... tch...
strike ya...

692
00:29:30,886 --> 00:29:32,122
with his arrow.

693
00:29:32,122 --> 00:29:33,725
Luckily, I'm a surgeon.

694
00:29:33,725 --> 00:29:35,595
[laughs]

695
00:29:35,595 --> 00:29:37,532
That's good.

696
00:29:39,102 --> 00:29:41,340
Oh, I definitely approve.

697
00:29:47,753 --> 00:29:48,788
We're here.

698
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:49,991
[chuckles awkwardly]

699
00:29:49,991 --> 00:29:51,360
‐You okay?
‐Yeah.

700
00:29:52,797 --> 00:29:54,634
Thanks for that.

701
00:29:54,634 --> 00:29:56,403
I probably...

702
00:29:56,403 --> 00:29:57,907
would have still
been sitting in traffic.

703
00:29:57,907 --> 00:29:58,909
It was nothing.

704
00:29:58,909 --> 00:30:01,413
You know, I'd do the same
for any, uh, colleague.

705
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:05,454
See you tomorrow.

706
00:30:05,454 --> 00:30:07,793
Yeah. Thanks, Doc.

707
00:30:10,364 --> 00:30:12,636
[engine revs]

708
00:30:30,438 --> 00:30:32,308
[cell phone ringing]

709
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:35,214
Professor Carver. Hi.

710
00:30:35,214 --> 00:30:36,651
<i>This is</i>
<i>your midpoint check‐in,</i>

711
00:30:36,651 --> 00:30:37,485
Miss McKay.

712
00:30:37,485 --> 00:30:39,022
How's it going?

713
00:30:39,022 --> 00:30:41,026
Great. Wonderful.

714
00:30:41,026 --> 00:30:44,599
Oh. Your enthusiasm suggests
you've made progress.

715
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:45,802
Yep.

716
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:48,474
Uh, well, I don't‐‐
I don't know if I would say...

717
00:30:49,409 --> 00:30:50,478
<i>There's definitely been‐‐</i>

718
00:30:50,478 --> 00:30:53,384
So, Charles hasn't spoken
a single word yet?

719
00:30:54,654 --> 00:30:55,956
No.

720
00:30:55,956 --> 00:30:56,958

the second secret ingredient.

901
00:39:23,212 --> 00:39:25,183
This might be a good time
to tell you

902
00:39:25,183 --> 00:39:26,452
that I am a terrible cook.

903
00:39:26,452 --> 00:39:28,489
Well, luckily,
we're baking, not cooking.

904
00:39:28,489 --> 00:39:30,193
It's more science than art.

905
00:39:30,193 --> 00:39:31,829
Oh. So that's why you like it.

906
00:39:31,829 --> 00:39:32,999
Bingo. Can you stir this?

907
00:39:32,999 --> 00:39:33,867
Yeah.

908
00:39:33,867 --> 00:39:36,038
Thanks, Doc.

909
00:39:36,038 --> 00:39:37,774
So why did you
become a doctor, anyway?

910
00:39:39,912 --> 00:39:42,317
Well, there's a lot of reasons
I became a doctor.

911
00:39:42,317 --> 00:39:45,156
It's, uh, methodical, orderly.

912
00:39:45,156 --> 00:39:48,195
There's generally a reliable way
of doing things

913
00:39:48,195 --> 00:39:49,498
in order to achieve
a certain outcome.

914
00:39:50,633 --> 00:39:51,870
That's very practical.

915
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:54,007
And you know
the other reason.

916
00:39:54,007 --> 00:39:55,911
Can you crumble these?

917
00:39:55,911 --> 00:39:58,984
Uh... sure.

918
00:39:58,984 --> 00:40:00,753
What is "the other reason"?

919
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:05,730
Ah, it's, uh...
it's kind of mushy.

920
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:06,565
They're Graham crackers.

921
00:40:06,565 --> 00:40:08,069
Aren't they supposed
to be mushy?

922
00:40:08,069 --> 00:40:11,008
No, I mean, the other reason
I wanted to become a surgeon.

923
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,412
It's a...
It's a little mushy.

924
00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:15,783
Well, your secret
is safe with me.

927

Okay.

928
00:40:26,505 --> 00:40:28,609
I lost my parents
in a car accident when I was 11.

929
00:40:30,981 --> 00:40:32,083
I'm sorry.

930
00:40:32,083 --> 00:40:34,020
Max and I moved in
with our grandparents

931
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,958
not long after.

932
00:40:37,127 --> 00:40:39,631
I asked for a stethoscope
that Christmas.

933
00:40:41,702 --> 00:40:43,406
So you knew you wanted
to be a doctor

934
00:40:43,406 --> 00:40:44,441
since you were a kid?

935
00:40:44,441 --> 00:40:47,247
I don't know, I guess.

936
00:40:47,247 --> 00:40:50,653
And what I really wanted
was to do everything I could

937
00:40:50,653 --> 00:40:52,757
to help people
never experience

938
00:40:52,757 --> 00:40:54,694
the heartache
that I went through.

939
00:40:54,694 --> 00:40:56,966
You know, I thought
if I studied hard enough,

940
00:40:56,966 --> 00:40:58,402
I could...

941
00:40:58,402 --> 00:40:59,671
change the outcome...

942
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,742
for other people.

943
00:41:03,279 --> 00:41:07,153
Gives new meaning
to being a heart doctor, huh?

944
00:41:07,153 --> 00:41:08,522
Told you it was mushy.

945
00:41:08,522 --> 00:41:10,593
No.

946
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:12,697
It's sweet.

947
00:41:16,772 --> 00:41:18,309
What about you?

948
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,948
Why'd you decide
to go into music therapy?

949
00:41:22,817 --> 00:41:24,187
I also lost my mom,

950
00:41:24,187 --> 00:41:26,391
and my grandma raised me.

951
00:41:26,391 --> 00:41:27,861
I used to sing to her

952
00:41:27,861 --> 00:41:32,003
and she always told me
it made her feel better.

953
00:41:33,105 --> 00:41:36,913
So right before she passed away,
I made her this promise that...

954
00:41:38,082 --> 00:41:39,184
...no matter what,

955
00:41:39,184 --> 00:41:42,724
I would try to use my voice
to heal people.

956
00:41:44,027 --> 00:41:46,198
Wow.

957
00:41:46,198 --> 00:41:47,935
I didn't know that.

958
00:41:47,935 --> 00:41:49,271
Yeah.

959
00:41:50,473 --> 00:41:53,245
So, who's the special person
in Violet McKay's life?

960
00:41:53,245 --> 00:41:55,216
[chuckles]
There is no special person.

961
00:41:55,216 --> 00:41:56,218
Why not?

962
00:41:56,218 --> 00:41:58,322
Because.

963
00:41:58,322 --> 00:41:59,724
I don't know.

964
00:41:59,724 --> 00:42:02,497
My last relationship ended
with him moving away to Denver.

965
00:42:02,497 --> 00:42:04,034
You didn't want to go with him?

966
00:42:04,034 --> 00:42:06,205
He didn't ask me.

967
00:42:06,205 --> 00:42:07,474
Which is fine,

968
00:42:07,474 --> 00:42:09,177
because it allowed me

969
00:42:09,177 --> 00:42:11,482
to pour my time and energy
into my career.

970
00:42:11,482 --> 00:42:12,684
Huh.

971
00:42:12,684 --> 00:42:13,853
Well, I'd say

972
00:42:13,853 --> 00:42:17,460
that was a colossal
error in judgment on his part.

973

Thank you.

When was your last relationship?

976
00:42:27,413 --> 00:42:30,019
Ended about two years ago.

977

I was gonna propose.

with the greats?

to ABBA's "Dancing Queen"

Music can tap into
our emotional systems.

1016

I'll be driving my car

1017

on the radio,

1019

I am just transported back
to that certain time in my life.

1020
00:44:02,047 --> 00:44:05,853
A song can stimulate our memory
in powerful ways.

1021
00:44:05,853 --> 00:44:10,463
It can make us feel things
we haven't felt in a long time.

You're not a big V‐Day fan?

1081
00:47:38,279 --> 00:47:40,016
‐Eh.
‐That's a shocker.

1082
00:47:40,016 --> 00:47:42,320
I like that it means something
to my grandparents‐‐

1083
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:45,226
50 years together,
that's quite an accomplishment.

1084
00:47:45,226 --> 00:47:47,297
It certainly means something
to Desiree and Max.

1085
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:48,399
Ooh...

1086
00:47:48,399 --> 00:47:51,505
I've just never really had
a reason to celebrate it,

1087
00:47:51,505 --> 00:47:53,108
personally.

1088
00:47:53,108 --> 00:47:54,711
Well, now you do.

1089
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,350
Your grandfather is the reason.

1090
00:47:58,485 --> 00:47:59,454
Right.

1091
00:48:00,723 --> 00:48:03,295
So, I take it
you're a big V‐Day fan?

1092
00:48:03,295 --> 00:48:06,101
[chuckles]
Well, I love me a love song‐‐

1093
00:48:06,101 --> 00:48:07,203
that's for sure‐‐

1094
00:48:07,203 --> 00:48:10,276
but I guess I was more into it
when I was a kid.

1095
00:48:10,276 --> 00:48:12,313
Every year, my grandma and I
would make Valentines

1096
00:48:12,313 --> 00:48:13,849
for everyone in my class.

1097
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:16,788
And this one year,
she gave me this music box.

1098
00:48:16,788 --> 00:48:18,292
I still have it.

1099
00:48:18,292 --> 00:48:21,231
I can't fall asleep at night
unless I hear that song.

1100
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:23,402
Your grandma sounds like
she was a pretty amazing lady.

1101
00:48:24,571 --> 00:48:27,844
Music has always been a way
for me to feel close to her.

1102
00:48:29,214 --> 00:48:31,618
Well, I'm sure she would've
been proud of you, too.

1103
00:48:31,618 --> 00:48:34,157
I'd like to think so.

1104
00:48:34,157 --> 00:48:37,163
I know this might sound
a little weird,

1105
00:48:37,163 --> 00:48:39,267
but every time I see "11:11,"

1106
00:48:39,267 --> 00:48:40,770
I know she's with me.

1107
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:43,242
It was just our special number.

1108
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:45,680
Can't believe I only have
a few more days left

1109
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:46,782
with your grandpa.

1110
00:48:48,018 --> 00:48:51,892
Why the deadline to get Grandpa
to speak by Valentine's Day?

1111
00:48:51,892 --> 00:48:55,299
Because, if I don't,
I have to retake the class,

1112
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:58,305
which means a whole new
trimester at school,

1113
00:48:58,305 --> 00:49:00,944
and I don't think my dream job
at the university hospital

1114
00:49:00,944 --> 00:49:03,315
will still be waiting for me.

1115
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:06,388
You know, my cousin, Charlie,
works there.

1116
00:49:06,388 --> 00:49:08,359
Might be able to put in
a good word for you?

1117
00:49:08,359 --> 00:49:10,529
I didn't realize you were under
so much pressure.

1118
00:49:10,529 --> 00:49:11,665
[chuckles]

1119
00:49:11,665 --> 00:49:13,569
Would you have been easier
on me if you did?

1120
00:49:13,569 --> 00:49:15,239
Not a chance.

1121
00:49:16,308 --> 00:49:17,777
Didn't think so.

1122
00:49:17,777 --> 00:49:20,082
Looks like Cupid threw up
in your basket.

1123
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:22,520
Wow. You really despise Cupid.

1124
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,822
How could I despise a baby?

1125
00:49:23,822 --> 00:49:25,926
I just think he should
put some clothes on.

1126
00:49:25,926 --> 00:49:28,365
I'll have you know
I am starting to warm up

1127
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:30,603
to this whole
Valentine's Day thing.

1128
00:49:30,603 --> 00:49:33,208
Wow. One trip to the market
and you're like a brand‐new man.

1129
00:49:33,208 --> 00:49:34,444
[chuckles]

1130
00:49:34,444 --> 00:49:35,613
Hi.

1131
00:49:35,613 --> 00:49:38,619
Okay, we got streamers...

1132
00:49:38,619 --> 00:49:40,256
napkins...

1133
00:49:40,256 --> 00:49:42,060
candles, plates...

1134
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:44,931
And every kind of heart
the market has to offer.

1135
00:49:44,931 --> 00:49:47,103
What's with
all the decorations?

1136
00:49:47,103 --> 00:49:49,474
I don't know,
I was feeling kind of festive.

1137
00:49:49,474 --> 00:49:52,814
I thought maybe I'd go decorate
the guest house, you know?

1138
00:49:52,814 --> 00:49:54,351
Romantic Valentine's Day
for one.

1139
00:49:55,753 --> 00:49:57,690
You are adorable.

1140
00:49:57,690 --> 00:50:00,396
Just don't
let my grandmother see.

1141
00:50:00,396 --> 00:50:01,665
Wait a second.

1142
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,235
What if we decorate
their living room?

1143
00:50:03,235 --> 00:50:04,537
I'm confused.

1144
00:50:04,537 --> 00:50:06,708
I just told you my grandma
doesn't do decorations.

1145
00:50:06,708 --> 00:50:08,379
No. No, no. No, no.
Listen. Hear me out.

1146
00:50:08,379 --> 00:50:09,247
What if we decorate it

1147
00:50:09,247 --> 00:50:10,984
and surprise them
for their 50th?

1148
00:50:11,918 --> 00:50:13,355
It's not every day

1149
00:50:13,355 --> 00:50:14,791
that they get to celebrate
a milestone like this.

1150
00:50:14,791 --> 00:50:16,762
Okay. I'm in.

1151
00:50:16,762 --> 00:50:18,098
Here you go.

1152
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,467
Wait. Did you just say
you were in?

1153
00:50:19,467 --> 00:50:20,669
Yeah.

1154
00:50:20,669 --> 00:50:22,206
[cash drawer rumbles]

1155
00:50:22,206 --> 00:50:24,077
Huh. 11.11.

1156
00:50:24,077 --> 00:50:25,146
Weird.

1157
00:50:27,383 --> 00:50:29,020
Thanks.

1158
00:50:29,989 --> 00:50:31,458
Are you spotting me?

1159
00:50:31,458 --> 00:50:32,393
Yes, I'm spotting you.

1160
00:50:32,393 --> 00:50:33,295
What are you doing up there?
You got it?

1161
00:50:33,295 --> 00:50:34,731
I think that looks pretty good.

1162
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:36,501
Hey! I think
I hear them coming.

1163
00:50:36,501 --> 00:50:37,637
Oh, okay.

1164
00:50:41,946 --> 00:50:43,515
[both] Surprise!

1165
00:50:45,553 --> 00:50:47,757
What do you think, Grandma?

1166
00:50:47,757 --> 00:50:50,129
I think...

1167
00:50:50,129 --> 00:50:51,898
I think it's wonderful.

1168
00:50:51,898 --> 00:50:53,202
Thank you.

1169
00:50:53,202 --> 00:50:55,306
‐I'm glad you like it.
‐Yeah.

1170
00:50:55,306 --> 00:50:58,412
And this is perfect
for our 50th, too.

1171
00:50:58,412 --> 00:51:00,282
[chuckles] Oh, you.

1172
00:51:00,282 --> 00:51:02,687
Thank you.

1173
00:51:02,687 --> 00:51:04,023
Ohh.

1174
00:51:04,023 --> 00:51:06,261
Oh, this is so lovely.

Ah, this is
such a romantic movie.

1182
00:51:24,604 --> 00:51:26,641
Right?

1183

1184
00:51:28,011 --> 00:51:30,783
I love black‐and‐white films.

What do you say

1186
00:51:31,886 --> 00:51:33,990
we give these two lovebirds
some time alone?

1187
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:35,526
You want to go get some snacks?

1188
00:51:35,526 --> 00:51:38,265
Yeah, snacks sound good.

Hey, did you say "snacks"?

1190
00:51:39,701 --> 00:51:40,736

I can't remember
the last time

00:51:49,154 --> 00:51:51,491
Grandma and Grandpa
went on a proper date.

1196
00:51:51,491 --> 00:51:54,431
I can't believe that
they've been together 50 years.

1197
00:51:54,431 --> 00:51:56,869

You really like that show?

I support Desiree.

1201
00:52:03,215 --> 00:52:05,186
Would you ever
go on <i>The Single Man?</i>

1202
00:52:05,186 --> 00:52:07,991
What? No. No.
I would totally lose.

1203
00:52:07,991 --> 00:52:10,596
I would become best friends
with all the women.

1204
00:52:10,596 --> 00:52:12,333
I'm not very competitive.

Oh. So it's my fault?

I hope Desiree finds love
at her singles mixer.

You going to that thing?

1212
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,865
Yeah, of course,

that chocolate fountain?

it would be kind of cool

if two people fell in love
at the mixer, you know?

00:52:50,843 --> 00:52:52,780
Well, it happened
to my grandma and grandpa,

1225
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:54,651
so I think it's possible.

00:52:54,651 --> 00:52:55,753
Number 11!

00:52:55,753 --> 00:52:57,290
What about Mr. Denver?

1228
00:52:57,290 --> 00:52:59,494
Was that love at first sight?

00:52:59,494 --> 00:53:03,035
Ha! Uh, not really.

1230
00:53:03,035 --> 00:53:07,176
It wasn't that "Cupid's arrow
hitting you in the chest"

00:53:07,176 --> 00:53:09,481
head‐over‐heels
kind of love.

‐Oh, yeah?
‐Yeah.

are blue.

00:53:35,332 --> 00:53:36,401
Okay.

1248
00:53:36,401 --> 00:53:38,338

about music therapy...

No, you don't.

1250
00:53:39,374 --> 00:53:41,278
But I think
I'm coming around on you.

1251
00:53:42,713 --> 00:53:43,815
How'd I do?

1252
00:53:43,815 --> 00:53:45,319
I think that was
too many syllables.

1253
00:53:45,319 --> 00:53:48,292
I'm pretty sure
that was iambic pentameter.

1254
00:53:48,292 --> 00:53:50,229
[chuckles]

1255
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:53,669
Oh, I think
I remember my poem now.

1256
00:53:53,669 --> 00:53:54,972
Oh, yeah?

1257
00:53:54,972 --> 00:53:56,208
‐Mm‐hmm.
‐It's never gonna top mine.

1258
00:53:57,376 --> 00:53:58,412
Just wait.

1259
00:53:58,412 --> 00:53:59,814
See? Competitive.

1260
00:53:59,814 --> 00:54:01,017
[chuckles]

1261
00:54:01,017 --> 00:54:02,386
Okay, roses are red.

1262
00:54:02,386 --> 00:54:04,992
‐Okay.
‐Violets are blue.

1263
00:54:04,992 --> 00:54:06,862
Doctors can be arrogant...

1264
00:54:06,862 --> 00:54:08,131
Hey!

1265
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,071
But their hearts can be true.

1266
00:54:11,071 --> 00:54:13,508
All right. Not bad.

1267
00:54:13,508 --> 00:54:15,045
Not bad?

1268
00:54:15,045 --> 00:54:16,848
That was spectacular.

1269
00:54:16,848 --> 00:54:18,452
"Spectacular"
might be a bit much.

1270
00:54:18,452 --> 00:54:21,424
Okay, well, it was marvelous,
at the very least.

1271
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:22,693
Satisfactory.

1272
00:54:22,693 --> 00:54:23,997
"Satisfactory"?

1273
00:54:23,997 --> 00:54:25,432
[woman] Hey!
You're blocking the movie!

1274
00:54:25,432 --> 00:54:26,301
Sorry!

1275
00:54:26,301 --> 00:54:27,871
We forgot the popcorn.

1276
00:54:27,871 --> 00:54:30,042
The popcorn! Right!

1277
00:54:31,111 --> 00:54:32,580
Hey, Grams, be right back.

1278
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:34,684
‐Just getting some popcorn.
‐Free popcorn.

1279
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:56,795
[music playing]

1280
00:55:02,707 --> 00:55:04,644
[knocking]

1281
00:55:10,089 --> 00:55:11,358
[giggling]

1282
00:55:11,358 --> 00:55:12,827
Surprise!

1283
00:55:12,827 --> 00:55:14,530
What are you doing here?

1284
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:17,169
I started to make
Valentine's Day cookies,

1285
00:55:17,169 --> 00:55:20,109
but the idea of making
V‐Day cookies all by myself

1286
00:55:20,109 --> 00:55:21,745
felt too depressing.

1287
00:55:23,782 --> 00:55:25,452
What's wrong? You look off.

1288
00:55:25,452 --> 00:55:27,490
What? Nothing.

1289
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,962
Mm‐hmm.

1290
00:55:29,962 --> 00:55:32,500
I guess
I'm feeling a little...

1291
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,137
confused.

1292
00:55:34,137 --> 00:55:36,775
Oh. Is this about
Dr. McHandsome?

1293
00:55:36,775 --> 00:55:38,645
N‐No.

1294
00:55:38,645 --> 00:55:39,882
No.

1295
00:55:39,882 --> 00:55:41,484
What's there
to be confused about?

1296
00:55:41,484 --> 00:55:44,357
I guess I just‐‐
I wasn't expecting to...

1297
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:46,861
I wasn't looking for...

1298
00:55:46,861 --> 00:55:47,998
Love?

1299
00:55:47,998 --> 00:55:50,069
What? No.

1300
00:55:50,069 --> 00:55:52,173
Nobody said
anything about love.

1301
00:55:52,173 --> 00:55:54,143
I just...
you know what I think it is?

1302
00:55:54,143 --> 00:55:56,514
I think that it's all this
Valentine's Day stuff.

1303
00:55:56,514 --> 00:55:58,218
It's just getting to my head.
That's it.

1304
00:55:58,218 --> 00:56:00,155
Okay, well,
forget about all this.

1305
00:56:00,155 --> 00:56:02,894
Because we...

1306
00:56:02,894 --> 00:56:05,499
we have to break some hearts.

1307
00:56:06,568 --> 00:56:07,636
‐Okay.
‐Shh.

1308
00:56:07,636 --> 00:56:08,672
It's okay, it's okay.

1309
00:56:08,672 --> 00:56:10,709
Shh. Des, no.
This is a terrible idea.

1310
00:56:10,709 --> 00:56:12,546
No, it's totally fine, okay?
We'll be super‐quiet.

1311
00:56:12,546 --> 00:56:14,584
No one will never know
we were here.

1312
00:56:17,223 --> 00:56:19,227
‐[crashing]
‐Oh!

1313
00:56:19,227 --> 00:56:20,796
‐[frantic whispering]
‐Stop. Where'd it go?

1314
00:56:20,796 --> 00:56:21,831
Excuse me?

1315
00:56:21,831 --> 00:56:24,203
[shrieking]

1316
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:28,245
[chuckles awkwardly]
Cookies?

1317
00:56:28,245 --> 00:56:30,015
My issue is

1318
00:56:30,015 --> 00:56:31,418
I've got plenty of matches
on Love‐Link,

1319
00:56:31,418 --> 00:56:32,820
but the minute
I get passionate

1320
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:35,225
and start talking about how much
I love flowers and romance,

1321
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:36,561
they disappear.

1322
00:56:36,561 --> 00:56:38,098
Do you think

1323
00:56:38,098 --> 00:56:39,634
I'm scaring away
my soulmate?

1324
00:56:39,634 --> 00:56:42,206
We didn't have
all this crazy technology

1325
00:56:42,206 --> 00:56:43,475
when I was dating,

1326
00:56:43,475 --> 00:56:46,681
and I certainly had
my fair share of, um...

1327
00:56:47,951 --> 00:56:51,091
..."love links,"
I think it was.

1328
00:56:51,091 --> 00:56:53,362
But this is what I learned,
Desiree‐‐

1329
00:56:53,362 --> 00:56:56,869
you cannot scare away
your soulmate.

1330
00:56:57,971 --> 00:56:59,474
You just can't.

1331
00:56:59,474 --> 00:57:03,148
The right one will love you
just the way you are.

1332
00:57:03,148 --> 00:57:06,688
Wow. You're so intuitive,
Mary Anne.

1333
00:57:06,688 --> 00:57:07,757
[laughs]

1334
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:10,362
[gasps softly]

1335
00:57:10,362 --> 00:57:13,301
Maybe you could help Violet
with...

1336
00:57:13,301 --> 00:57:15,606
her love life.

1337
00:57:17,076 --> 00:57:18,980
What's up, Violet?
Let's hear it.

1338
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:20,149
Violet

1339
00:57:20,149 --> 00:57:22,153
has this...

1340
00:57:22,153 --> 00:57:23,722
‐Friend.
‐Mm‐hmm. ...Friend.

1341
00:57:23,722 --> 00:57:24,757
A friend...

1342
00:57:24,757 --> 00:57:27,797
that you want
to be more than a friend?

1343
00:57:27,797 --> 00:57:33,241
Well, up until recently,
I really disliked him.

1344
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:35,279
Mm‐hmm. What changed?

1345
00:57:35,279 --> 00:57:38,618
It's like he has this tough
outer‐shell around him.

1346
00:57:38,618 --> 00:57:40,222
Like a candy?

1347
00:57:40,222 --> 00:57:41,458
But on the inside,
he's...

1348
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,228
Sweet and wonderful?

1349
00:57:43,228 --> 00:57:44,898
Something like that.

1350
00:57:44,898 --> 00:57:46,134
Mm.

1351
00:57:46,134 --> 00:57:47,336
It's just the more
that I learn,

1352
00:57:47,336 --> 00:57:49,340
the more I seem...

1353
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:51,946
[to not dislike him
as much as I thought I did.

1354
00:57:51,946 --> 00:57:53,181
Oh.

1355
00:57:53,181 --> 00:57:54,750
So what are you waiting for?

1356
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:56,621
[whispers]
I think she's scared.

1357
00:57:56,621 --> 00:57:58,225
You know
I'm sitting right here?

1358
00:57:58,225 --> 00:57:59,794
I'm just saying!

1359
00:57:59,794 --> 00:58:04,470
Okay, so. So, you are the girl
who takes care of everyone else,

1360
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:06,976
but won't allow
her own soulmate in?

1361
00:58:06,976 --> 00:58:08,913
Is that it?

1362
00:58:08,913 --> 00:58:11,886
Oh! She is so wise.

1363
00:58:11,886 --> 00:58:14,892
My advice?

1364
00:58:14,892 --> 00:58:17,363
Listen to your heart.

1365
00:58:18,765 --> 00:58:20,870
[♪♪♪♪♪]

1366
00:58:33,741 --> 00:58:35,645
[indistinct P. A. announcements]

1367
00:58:37,816 --> 00:58:39,018
Did you make these?

1368
00:58:39,018 --> 00:58:41,122
You know, I can't believe
I'm actually saying this,

1369
00:58:41,122 --> 00:58:42,124
but yes.

1370
00:58:42,124 --> 00:58:43,427
I baked cookies.

1371
00:58:43,427 --> 00:58:45,231
Do you want one?

1372
00:58:45,231 --> 00:58:46,165
Yes!

1373
00:58:51,108 --> 00:58:53,714
Dr. Williams,
you've gotta try these.

1374
00:58:53,714 --> 00:58:55,551
Did I just hear that correctly?

1375
00:58:55,551 --> 00:58:56,820
You're baking now?

1376
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:58,189
I learned from the best.

1377
00:58:59,426 --> 00:59:00,595
Let's see here.

1378
00:59:00,595 --> 00:59:02,699
Um... anatomically incorrect.

1379
00:59:05,304 --> 00:59:06,573
Mm.

1380
00:59:06,573 --> 00:59:09,379
Almost good enough to make me
a Valentine's Day believer.

1381
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:13,152
So what brings you in?
Trying to make some new friends?

1382
00:59:13,152 --> 00:59:16,125
Well. I just finished
a double session with Charles

1383
00:59:16,125 --> 00:59:17,929
since the deadline
is around the corner.

1384
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:19,098
Did you need me to come back?

1385
00:59:19,098 --> 00:59:20,200
I could get someone
to cover my shift.

1386
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,104
No, no, no.
Your patients need you.

1387
00:59:22,104 --> 00:59:24,276
And Charles is actually
doing really great.

1388
00:59:24,276 --> 00:59:26,280
Mm.

1389
00:59:27,549 --> 00:59:30,621
I actually stopped by tonight
because...

1390
00:59:30,621 --> 00:59:32,892
Why don't we, uh,
step over here for a minute?

1391
00:59:35,298 --> 00:59:37,202
What's up?

1392
00:59:39,306 --> 00:59:40,208
I was thinking‐‐

1393
00:59:40,208 --> 00:59:43,681
Mm? Yeah, well,
that's a good start.

1394
00:59:44,616 --> 00:59:46,553
Maybe we could go

1395
00:59:46,553 --> 00:59:48,657
to the O Fish Ally
Singles Mixer.

1396
00:59:48,657 --> 00:59:51,363
Yeah. We already
talked about that.

1397
00:59:51,363 --> 00:59:52,465
Together.

1398
00:59:52,465 --> 00:59:54,736
Oh.

1399
00:59:59,479 --> 01:00:01,048
As colleagues.

Oh.

‐Yeah.
‐Colleagues.

1402
01:00:04,489 --> 01:00:05,558
As colleagues.

1403
01:00:05,558 --> 01:00:07,127
You know,
we could drive together.

1404
01:00:07,127 --> 01:00:08,497
Save some gas.

1405
01:00:08,497 --> 01:00:09,633
‐Mm.
‐What do you think?

1406
01:00:09,633 --> 01:00:12,372
Okay. Sure.

1407

Great.

1408
01:00:13,274 --> 01:00:15,945
Great. Well,
I'll pick you up tonight.

1409

Just for the‐‐

Hi! Hi. Yeah.
The fountain's not here yet.

<i>Wait, what do you mean?</i>

1418
01:00:33,146 --> 01:00:34,716
And I already tried calling
the chocolate shop,

1419
01:00:34,716 --> 01:00:36,820
and no one answered
and I have

1420
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:37,989
<i>the perfect spot for it,</i>

1421
01:00:37,989 --> 01:00:39,359
<i>but, uh, it's not here,</i>
<i>so...</i>

1422

Your chocolate fountain
is on its way.

01:00:42,498 --> 01:00:44,235
It better be.

1424
01:00:50,013 --> 01:00:51,115
Oh, hey.

Hi.

1426
01:00:52,251 --> 01:00:54,121
Max is heading
in the same direction,

1427
01:00:54,121 --> 01:00:56,293
so I figured we could just
all drive together.

1428
01:00:56,293 --> 01:00:58,731
You know.
Save on gas.

1429

Honestly,

1522
01:04:57,375 --> 01:04:59,177
it started
at the farmer's market,

1523
01:04:59,177 --> 01:05:01,783
and I met this cute
married couple with a farm

1524
01:05:01,783 --> 01:05:05,156
who had to throw away
their extra flowers every week,

1525
01:05:05,156 --> 01:05:07,127
so I volunteered
to deliver the extras

1526
01:05:07,127 --> 01:05:09,732
to the local hospital,
which is where I met Violet,

1527
01:05:09,732 --> 01:05:11,469
and then I realized,

1528
01:05:11,469 --> 01:05:15,277
I could support
local farmers' work

1529
01:05:15,277 --> 01:05:17,315
if I opened up my own shop

1530
01:05:17,315 --> 01:05:19,752

ended up taking off,

to run away right now?

01:08:26,226 --> 01:08:27,595
Thanks.

1608
01:08:27,595 --> 01:08:30,334
Or at least that's what
Mary Anne says, anyways.

1609
01:08:30,334 --> 01:08:32,371
We're friends now.
We text.

1610
01:08:32,371 --> 01:08:33,540
‐Yeah?
‐Mm‐hmm.

1611
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:34,409
Okay.

1612
01:08:34,409 --> 01:08:36,413
‐Deep breath.
‐Okay.

1613
01:08:36,413 --> 01:08:37,882
You're doing the right thing.

1614
01:08:37,882 --> 01:08:38,984
Mm‐hmm.

1615
01:08:38,984 --> 01:08:42,157
I know you better than
anybody else on this planet.

1616
01:08:42,157 --> 01:08:43,627
You deserve to be loved.

1617
01:08:43,627 --> 01:08:44,595
‐Okay.
‐Okay?

1618
01:08:44,595 --> 01:08:45,531
Okay.

1619
01:08:45,531 --> 01:08:47,835
Now, you're gonna
march over there‐‐

1620
01:08:47,835 --> 01:08:49,104
Mm‐hmm.

1621
01:08:49,104 --> 01:08:50,507
And you're gonna say,
"Dr. Blake"‐‐

1622
01:08:50,507 --> 01:08:51,576
I don't call him that.

1623
01:08:51,576 --> 01:08:53,112
It doesn't matter.
I like how it sounds.

1624
01:08:53,112 --> 01:08:54,415
‐Okay. Okay.
‐All right? Okay.

1625
01:08:54,415 --> 01:08:57,555
"Dr. Blake, I am
falling in love with you."

1626

...With you.
"I'm falling in love with you."

1630
01:09:05,337 --> 01:09:06,739
Exactly. See?
There's nothing to it.

1631
01:09:06,739 --> 01:09:07,641
You can do this.

1632
01:09:07,641 --> 01:09:08,710
I can do this!

1633
01:09:08,710 --> 01:09:09,645
Yes!

1634
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:10,781
What if he doesn't
feel the same?

1635
01:09:10,781 --> 01:09:11,616
Are you kidding me?

1636
01:09:11,616 --> 01:09:14,087
I've seen the way
he looks at you.

1637
01:09:14,087 --> 01:09:15,524
How?

1638
01:09:15,524 --> 01:09:17,595
Like you're the only woman
in the world.

I am.

That's my girl.

1645
01:09:31,222 --> 01:09:32,291
Okay. I'm doing it.

1646
01:09:32,291 --> 01:09:34,395

there are so many men

did you see where the man
that was standing here went?

1658
01:10:01,335 --> 01:10:03,038
Was he tall?

1659
01:10:03,038 --> 01:10:03,873
Yeah.

1660
01:10:03,873 --> 01:10:06,211
Handsome,
like he could be in a movie?

1661
01:10:06,211 --> 01:10:07,647
Yeah. That's him.

1662
01:10:07,647 --> 01:10:09,117
Yeah.

1663
01:10:09,117 --> 01:10:10,721

Should've made your move sooner.

1668

I'm at my brother's house.

<i>Oh, Professor. Hi.</i>

1676
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:05,797
Listen, I know that I said

1677
01:11:05,797 --> 01:11:07,366
he would be speaking
by Valentine's Day,

1678
01:11:07,366 --> 01:11:09,437
but I have a whole day
with him still,

1679

Uh, no.

I'm calling
to congratulate you.

01:11:20,059 --> 01:11:23,065
I haven't seen my brother
this happy in a year.

I've already placed a call
to the university hospital.

I don't want to talk about it.

keeps the doctor away.

‐Too soon?

to talk to you right now.

It's okay.

I assume Max told you
where you could find me?

When I realized you left,

1744
01:14:11,534 --> 01:14:13,105
I caught a ride back
to my grandparents' house,

but you weren't there.

1746

your things.

Sure.

1752
01:14:39,490 --> 01:14:41,194
So why'd you leave
the mixer like that?

1753
01:14:42,965 --> 01:14:44,702
I don't know.

1754
01:14:44,702 --> 01:14:45,870
I was tired.

1755
01:14:45,870 --> 01:14:47,473
Violet.

1756
01:14:49,912 --> 01:14:51,749
I saw you.

1757
01:14:51,749 --> 01:14:53,285
With that beautiful blonde.

1758
01:14:53,285 --> 01:14:54,520
You had your arm around her.

01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:56,324
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What‐‐ what blonde?

1760

I don't need to know her name.

1762
01:15:00,065 --> 01:15:01,601
We call her "Charlie."

After Grandpa Charlie.

1764
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:05,476
She's my cousin.

...Who works at
the university hospital?

1766
01:15:08,649 --> 01:15:11,689
I was talking to her about
putting in a good word for you.

1767
01:15:11,689 --> 01:15:14,027
I mean, did you think
that she and I were...?

1768
01:15:14,027 --> 01:15:15,296
No. No.

01:15:15,296 --> 01:15:16,932
‐Because that‐‐
‐I mean, even if you were,

01:15:18,435 --> 01:15:19,705
Right.

1772
01:15:19,705 --> 01:15:21,942
Right!

1773
01:15:21,942 --> 01:15:23,713
So it was just
a huge misunderstanding?

1774
01:15:24,948 --> 01:15:28,622
Yeah, I‐‐
I think it is.

1775
01:15:28,622 --> 01:15:30,694
Ah.

1776
01:15:30,694 --> 01:15:32,363
Well, congratulations.

Oh, gosh, I almost... forgot.

1779
01:15:38,041 --> 01:15:41,247
Yeah, no, it's really exciting.

1780
01:15:41,247 --> 01:15:44,320
Their music‐therapy center
is second to none.

I know you still don't
believe in what I do‐‐
