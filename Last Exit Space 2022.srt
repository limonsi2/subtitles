3
00:00:14,482 --> 00:00:16,586
From time immemorial,

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,896
we humans have looked up
at the night sky,

5
00:00:19,931 --> 00:00:23,000
marveling at billions
of tiny specks.

6
00:00:26,758 --> 00:00:30,310
Settling on distant planets
was once the domain

7
00:00:30,344 --> 00:00:32,206
of poets and dreamers.

8
00:00:33,793 --> 00:00:36,448
But with every leap
in technology,

9
00:00:36,482 --> 00:00:39,344
we come closer
to realizing their dreams.

10
00:00:44,655 --> 00:00:48,068
Today, techies
and entrepreneurs

11
00:00:48,103 --> 00:00:50,862
plan to colonize
faraway planets.

12
00:00:53,068 --> 00:00:56,758
The first step on this journey
to conquer the galaxy,

13
00:00:56,793 --> 00:00:59,137
will be our own solar system.

14
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:07,482
Incredibly, scientists
are even working on voyages

15
00:01:07,517 --> 00:01:10,103
to planets around other stars.

16
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,655
They see us as
an interstellar species,

17
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:19,827
that will spread
across the cosmos.

18
00:01:23,724 --> 00:01:27,310
So have we humans
outgrown our little planet?

19
00:01:27,344 --> 00:01:31,344
Or do we need to seek
our destiny among the stars?

20
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:07,034
We're off on
a sweeping quest

21
00:02:07,068 --> 00:02:09,827
to discover
the cutting-edge projects

22
00:02:09,862 --> 00:02:12,551
driving today's
space revolution.

23
00:02:14,103 --> 00:02:18,862
On our voyage, we will learn
that the most ambitious ideas

24
00:02:18,896 --> 00:02:21,862
are sometimes found
in the remotest places.

25
00:02:25,965 --> 00:02:29,724
Our travels begin in
Coeur d'Alene, Idaho,

26
00:02:29,758 --> 00:02:33,034
where America's disaster
preppers go off-grid.

27
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:41,724
We want to meet the world's
most fervent prophet
of space colonization.

28
00:02:43,034 --> 00:02:46,724
Leading futurologist
Marshall Savage

29
00:02:46,758 --> 00:02:50,758
penned Colonizing The Galaxy
in Eight Easy Steps.

30
00:02:52,206 --> 00:02:55,689
He's mapped out
humanity's exit from Earth.

31
00:02:57,551 --> 00:03:01,448
This is an instinctive urge
of our species

32
00:03:01,482 --> 00:03:03,310
to migrate into space.

33
00:03:03,344 --> 00:03:06,137
The way salmon
return upstream.

34
00:03:06,172 --> 00:03:07,965
You know, this is something
we're going to do,

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,206
and you can see people
like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk
are actually doing it,

36
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:16,620
and they're an expression of
that urge of the human race

37
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:19,655
to spread itself, ultimately,
among the stars.

38
00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:22,172
And if we survive,
that will happen.

39
00:03:22,206 --> 00:03:24,931
and if it doesn't happen,
we probably won't survive.

40
00:03:32,482 --> 00:03:36,551
I've lived out west
all my life, and we've always
had forest fires.

41
00:03:36,586 --> 00:03:38,137
But never anything like this.

42
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:42,586
Whole towns are being
burned to the ground.

43
00:03:46,206 --> 00:03:49,448
And it makes you wonder
what is next year

44
00:03:49,482 --> 00:03:51,551
and the year after
going to be like.

45
00:04:01,344 --> 00:04:06,344
Marshall Savage
has observed that our climate
is at a tipping point.

46
00:04:11,448 --> 00:04:13,931
There is a catastrophe
in the making.

47
00:04:16,931 --> 00:04:19,448
We've already
advanced too far,

48
00:04:19,482 --> 00:04:23,000
in terms of changing
the underlying climate
to prevent it.

49
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:30,655
Marshall fears
that our planet may soon
become uninhabitable.

50
00:04:33,275 --> 00:04:35,620
I can't tell you when
it's going to happen.

51
00:04:35,655 --> 00:04:39,000
But we should go as soon
as we're capable of going.

52
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,965
In Copenhagen,
Anna Olsen has heard the call
to go to space.

53
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,068
It might be an unlikely place.

54
00:04:52,103 --> 00:04:55,896
But a harbor warehouse
is where the biology student

55
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:59,206
wants to take on
an immense challenge.

56
00:05:07,758 --> 00:05:10,655
She's determined
to be the first astronaut

57
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:13,655
of a group of
weekend rocketeers...

58
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:17,137
The Copenhagen Suborbitals.

59
00:05:17,172 --> 00:05:23,137
As motley as this crew
of students, electricians
and engineers may seem,

60
00:05:23,172 --> 00:05:27,137
their technology
is highly sophisticated.

61
00:05:27,172 --> 00:05:30,586
Anna and her team want
to go down in history

62
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:35,413
as the first amateur group to
complete a human spaceflight.

63
00:05:35,448 --> 00:05:36,862
Before going
into space,

64
00:05:36,896 --> 00:05:40,586
I think I will need to prepare
by exercising,

65
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,827
because you are exposed
to a lot of G-forces.

66
00:05:43,862 --> 00:05:48,482
So you have to be
some kind of physically fit.

67
00:05:51,793 --> 00:05:54,724
I think it will be a quite an
unpleasant journey up there,

68
00:05:54,758 --> 00:05:57,275
but once you reach
zero gravity,

69
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,689
I think it'll be amazing.

70
00:06:01,655 --> 00:06:08,413
Meanwhile,
Anna's father, Carsten Olsen,
is another astronaut hopeful.

71
00:06:08,448 --> 00:06:10,551
I actually
love space flights.

72
00:06:10,586 --> 00:06:13,103
I love the idea of going
to another planet.

73
00:06:13,137 --> 00:06:14,344
It's a great adventure.

74
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:16,862
It's like dreaming
about new worlds,

75
00:06:16,896 --> 00:06:19,551
and I have a huge dream
in my life.

76
00:06:19,586 --> 00:06:21,241
Looking at the moon
from space,

77
00:06:21,275 --> 00:06:22,724
that would be...

78
00:06:23,965 --> 00:06:25,551
Really, really beautiful,
I think.

79
00:06:29,413 --> 00:06:32,344
Financed entirely
by donations,

80
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:36,655
the Suborbitals are already
launching self-built rockets,

81
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:40,034
from this platform
in the Baltic Sea.

82
00:06:40,068 --> 00:06:44,689
The Danish Coast Guard closes
the area for boat traffic,

83
00:06:44,724 --> 00:06:49,379
when the scaled-down rockets
hurtle thousands of feet
into the sky.

84
00:06:57,172 --> 00:06:59,793
Encouraged by their successes,

85
00:06:59,827 --> 00:07:04,413
the Suborbitals are now
building a full-sized rocket.

86
00:07:04,448 --> 00:07:07,482
Anna is personally
seeing to the details.

87
00:07:09,206 --> 00:07:13,034
I am painting the tanks
for the Spica rocket,

88
00:07:13,068 --> 00:07:16,482
which is the rocket that will
hopefully go into space.

89
00:07:16,517 --> 00:07:19,448
And it is one meter
in diameter

90
00:07:19,482 --> 00:07:23,275
which is also the space
that I will be sitting in.

91
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:27,724
So I will be sitting in
a cannonball position,

92
00:07:27,758 --> 00:07:30,379
with my knees up to my ears.

93
00:07:30,413 --> 00:07:32,137
So, that's not a lot of space.

94
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,517
Unfortunately,
cramped conditions

95
00:07:41,551 --> 00:07:45,344
aren't the only danger
DIY astronauts might face.

96
00:07:50,862 --> 00:07:52,827
And we have splashdown.

97
00:07:55,344 --> 00:07:59,413
Some of
the unmanned tests
didn't turn out well,

98
00:07:59,448 --> 00:08:03,793
with engines failing
and tanks running out of fuel.

99
00:08:03,827 --> 00:08:08,241
And that's why
before Anna and Carsten
lift off to the stars,

100
00:08:08,275 --> 00:08:13,034
this gentleman will
have to complete some
successful flights.

101
00:08:13,068 --> 00:08:16,310
This is Rescue Randy,
our crash test dummy.

102
00:08:16,344 --> 00:08:18,620
He is our first
flight astronaut.

103
00:08:18,655 --> 00:08:21,517
He has been flying
several times in our capsules.

104
00:08:21,551 --> 00:08:24,551
And not each flight
has been very good.

105
00:08:26,034 --> 00:08:28,482
Once he flew in
one of the capsules

106
00:08:28,517 --> 00:08:32,068
where the parachute
didn't fall out as it was
supposed to.

107
00:08:34,758 --> 00:08:37,137
And he lost his leg
during that.

108
00:08:37,172 --> 00:08:39,758
Our doctor of medicine,
he told us

109
00:08:39,793 --> 00:08:43,379
that he would have
survived, but...

110
00:08:43,413 --> 00:08:45,793
He wouldn't be in
a very good condition.

111
00:08:45,827 --> 00:08:48,310
But you can still be a good
astronaut without a leg.

112
00:08:53,862 --> 00:08:56,448
Undaunted
by such incidents,

113
00:08:56,482 --> 00:08:59,724
we found Anna lost
in her own universe.

114
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,413
I dream of
going to space.

115
00:09:11,448 --> 00:09:13,965
And just floating around
in zero gravity.

116
00:09:20,241 --> 00:09:24,068
I would love to experience
the silence on another planet.

117
00:09:24,103 --> 00:09:25,172
For instance, on Mars.

118
00:09:25,931 --> 00:09:29,310
And just see how red it is.

119
00:09:29,344 --> 00:09:34,241
And experiencing
the totally uncolonized
planet.

120
00:09:44,586 --> 00:09:47,758
Anna and Carsten
are ready for takeoff.

121
00:09:47,793 --> 00:09:50,551
And they are not
the only enthusiasts

122
00:09:50,586 --> 00:09:53,241
looking forward
to the conquest of space.

123
00:10:04,517 --> 00:10:06,482
There is a race going on,

124
00:10:06,517 --> 00:10:10,068
faster and more ambitious
than ever before.

125
00:10:14,793 --> 00:10:18,931
Billionaire entrepreneurs
are venturing out into space

126
00:10:18,965 --> 00:10:21,586
in a testosterone-fueled
competition.

127
00:10:24,965 --> 00:10:28,034
With the survival
of humankind at stake,

128
00:10:28,068 --> 00:10:31,517
they're pushing
for the colonization
of our galaxy.

129
00:10:33,689 --> 00:10:37,034
What is your vision
for the future
of space exploration?

130
00:10:37,068 --> 00:10:41,137
What we wanna see is
millions of people living
and working in space.

131
00:10:41,172 --> 00:10:42,551
Space is a...

132
00:10:43,206 --> 00:10:44,275
Is an adventure.

133
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,448
It has limitless
resources that--

134
00:10:46,482 --> 00:10:49,689
You know, we're finding
that the Earth is a very
finite place.

135
00:10:49,724 --> 00:10:51,896
And we humans need
to go into space

136
00:10:51,931 --> 00:10:54,517
if we're to continue
to evolve our civilization.

137
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:01,620
We have
to drive innovation hard
to make life multi-planetary.

138
00:11:01,655 --> 00:11:05,965
I think this is very important
to secure the future of life
as we know it,

139
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,758
to ensure that the light of
consciousness does not go out.

140
00:11:12,034 --> 00:11:15,482
Landers and
starships are being built.

141
00:11:15,517 --> 00:11:19,034
Not only to take astronauts
to other planets,

142
00:11:19,068 --> 00:11:22,931
but to transport hundreds
of thousands of settlers

143
00:11:22,965 --> 00:11:28,586
to inhabit vast
space cities imagined
by Elon Musk and others.

144
00:11:51,517 --> 00:11:57,241
But what does colonizing
the dark desolation of space
really mean?

145
00:12:00,448 --> 00:12:06,379
In Creede, Colorado,
we seek out a man who can
shed light on the matter.

146
00:12:09,827 --> 00:12:14,448
Mike Foale spent more
than a year away
from our home planet.

147
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,206
For him, it was an
eye-opening experience.

148
00:12:21,137 --> 00:12:22,655
When you think
about what's out there,

149
00:12:22,689 --> 00:12:25,034
and what we're a part of
in terms of being the speck.

150
00:12:25,068 --> 00:12:27,655
The speck

151
00:12:27,689 --> 00:12:29,275
in this universe.

152
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,482
It's... It's pretty cosmic.

153
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,655
It's a mind-altering
experience.

154
00:12:34,275 --> 00:12:35,310
It's very exciting.

155
00:12:38,517 --> 00:12:43,206
Mike Foale
was once a commander
of our lone outpost in space.

156
00:12:44,896 --> 00:12:46,793
The International
Space Station is one of

157
00:12:46,827 --> 00:12:48,758
mankind's greatest
achievements.

158
00:12:49,931 --> 00:12:52,413
It's something equivalent,
I think, to the pyramids.

159
00:12:52,448 --> 00:12:54,827
It's one of those great
wonders of the world.

160
00:12:54,862 --> 00:12:58,620
And that contribution,
I think, to you know,
to human posterity

161
00:12:58,655 --> 00:13:00,965
is the beginning of
settlements in space.

162
00:13:04,448 --> 00:13:07,896
But venturing out
like this comes at a price...

163
00:13:09,862 --> 00:13:15,586
Mike Foale is a survivor
of a collision on the Russian
space station, Mir,

164
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,413
one of the worst accidents
in space history.

165
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:23,896
He knows from
personal experience

166
00:13:23,931 --> 00:13:27,448
what navigating outer space
really means.

167
00:13:29,586 --> 00:13:31,241
Space is
a hard environment.

168
00:13:31,275 --> 00:13:35,517
A vacuum at a temperature
on average ranging from

169
00:13:35,551 --> 00:13:39,862
minus 200 Celsius all the way
up to plus 200 Celsius.

170
00:13:39,896 --> 00:13:42,793
That's a huge variation
of temperature.

171
00:13:42,827 --> 00:13:44,551
And, of course,
there's no air.

172
00:13:44,586 --> 00:13:47,137
And if you go near
a window that doesn't have
ultraviolet protection,

173
00:13:47,172 --> 00:13:49,965
you get burned,
sunburned in 30 seconds.

174
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,758
And you'll also, occasionally,
look out at your spacecraft,

175
00:13:52,793 --> 00:13:54,586
and you'll see holes in--

176
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:58,000
In the solar arrays, and
you go, "Oh, wow!

177
00:13:58,034 --> 00:13:59,206
That was a rock
that went through."

178
00:14:06,689 --> 00:14:08,344
If things go wrong
in your spacecraft,

179
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:10,068
of course you're on
a knife's edge there.

180
00:14:10,103 --> 00:14:12,137
All of your life support
systems have to work.

181
00:14:13,206 --> 00:14:14,517
Your oxygen
has to be produced.

182
00:14:14,551 --> 00:14:16,965
Your carbon dioxide
has to be scrubbed.

183
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,758
Your water has
to be supplied and your food
needs to be present.

184
00:14:20,965 --> 00:14:22,655
So, that's the hard
part of space.

185
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:31,862
Despite all this,
Mike Foale remains unfazed.

186
00:14:33,931 --> 00:14:36,172
And there are
a number of humans like me,

187
00:14:36,206 --> 00:14:39,344
men and women, who are
driven by the same motivations
that I have.

188
00:14:40,862 --> 00:14:46,034
So, they will suffer well
the difficulties,
the challenges, the deaths,

189
00:14:46,068 --> 00:14:48,896
the disease,
all of the problems

190
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:53,172
of exploring and going
beyond the Earth
to settle in space.

191
00:14:55,379 --> 00:15:00,793
But it won't be
99.99% of humanity,
it'll be a tiny fraction.

192
00:15:00,827 --> 00:15:03,758
With that just 100 or 1,000
out in space,

193
00:15:03,793 --> 00:15:07,620
then humans will survive
the asteroid impact
that's bound to happen.

194
00:15:07,655 --> 00:15:11,413
Or the ecological disasters
that are bound to, you know,
bound to happen.

195
00:15:11,448 --> 00:15:13,655
Humanity as it...

196
00:15:13,689 --> 00:15:15,827
Not as it is today,
but as it will evolve,

197
00:15:15,862 --> 00:15:18,068
will continue
beyond the Earth.

198
00:15:29,931 --> 00:15:33,000
There will always
be people like Mike Foale

199
00:15:33,034 --> 00:15:35,827
who want to venture
out into the unknown,

200
00:15:35,862 --> 00:15:39,000
no matter how hazardous
it might be.

201
00:15:39,793 --> 00:15:42,655
It's the human
pioneering spirit

202
00:15:42,689 --> 00:15:45,689
that will drive us
into the solar system.

203
00:15:56,206 --> 00:16:02,448
To find out what
a space colony might look like
we've come to the Ramon Crater

204
00:16:02,482 --> 00:16:07,172
some 120 miles
south of Jerusalem
in the Negev Desert.

205
00:16:11,551 --> 00:16:17,724
There are few places on Earth
that are as geologically
similar to Mars.

206
00:16:18,482 --> 00:16:19,862
And that's the reason why

207
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:24,275
a precious cargo
is being transported
to this remote region.

208
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:49,724
Whoa, look at that.
Welcome to the desert.

209
00:16:50,517 --> 00:16:52,137
Welcome to Mars.

210
00:17:02,206 --> 00:17:03,413
That is the helmet

211
00:17:03,448 --> 00:17:06,482
of the experimental
spacesuit simulator, Aouda.X.

212
00:17:06,517 --> 00:17:08,482
We've been working
for more than ten years

213
00:17:08,517 --> 00:17:10,241
on this spacecraft
that we're in.

214
00:17:10,275 --> 00:17:12,275
It's able to mimic
all the major limitations

215
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,827
in actual space it would have,

216
00:17:13,862 --> 00:17:17,862
so seeing this here
means we're almost good to go.

217
00:17:20,379 --> 00:17:23,172
Astrophysicist
Gernot Gromer,

218
00:17:23,206 --> 00:17:27,379
is the director of
the Austrian Space Forum.

219
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:32,724
His organization is simulating
a possible colony on Mars.

220
00:17:32,758 --> 00:17:37,793
NASA and the European Space
Agency are also involved,

221
00:17:37,827 --> 00:17:42,206
making it the most
elaborate project
of its kind in the world.

222
00:17:43,482 --> 00:17:47,793
Today they are testing
a state-of-the-art spacesuit

223
00:17:47,827 --> 00:17:50,724
with sensors
and bio-feedback systems.

224
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:08,000
Ultimately,
after 30,000 generations
of Homo sapiensas a species,

225
00:18:08,034 --> 00:18:12,448
we are one of the first ones
who have the technological
means to do that journey.

226
00:18:13,413 --> 00:18:16,275
We are, I think,
a migratory species.

227
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,172
And I believe there will be
cities on Mars,

228
00:18:18,206 --> 00:18:20,034
for sure,
it's just a matter of time.

229
00:18:20,068 --> 00:18:23,482
It will be a statement
to the universe,
we are out there.

230
00:18:27,275 --> 00:18:29,724
This might be
the first glimpse

231
00:18:29,758 --> 00:18:32,103
of our future
as space colonists.

232
00:18:39,275 --> 00:18:44,862
But what challenges
will we have to overcome
to realize this dream?

233
00:18:53,827 --> 00:18:59,172
There is a man who is
more acquainted than most
with the challenges of Mars.

234
00:19:00,482 --> 00:19:04,344
Doug Hofmann works for
NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab,

235
00:19:04,379 --> 00:19:07,758
which has sent several rovers
to the red planet.

236
00:19:10,655 --> 00:19:14,620
He knows all about conditions
on this alien world.

237
00:19:18,517 --> 00:19:21,448
So, we have several
landers and rovers

238
00:19:21,482 --> 00:19:22,896
on the surface of Mars,

239
00:19:22,931 --> 00:19:26,275
and honestly,
for human habitation,

240
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:29,068
Mars is pretty inhospitable.

241
00:19:29,103 --> 00:19:31,103
So, it's cold for starters.

242
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:34,241
We also have, you know,
virtually no atmosphere,

243
00:19:34,275 --> 00:19:36,241
which contributes to it
being cold.

244
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:39,068
And of course we don't see
any living things

245
00:19:39,103 --> 00:19:41,689
on the surface of Mars
due to those harsh conditions.

246
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,793
Even getting there
would be fraught with danger.

247
00:19:48,827 --> 00:19:52,275
Astronauts would travel
outside the protection

248
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:57,655
of the Earth's magnetic field
and atmosphere that shield us
from radiation.

249
00:20:02,586 --> 00:20:07,206
Solar eruptions randomly fling
charged particles into space.

250
00:20:08,517 --> 00:20:13,068
Such a solar storm
could wipe out a crew
headed for Mars.

251
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:19,344
If you're traveling
between Earth and Mars,
out in deep space,

252
00:20:19,379 --> 00:20:22,172
and there's a significant
solar event,

253
00:20:22,206 --> 00:20:26,379
that can create sort of an
enormous amount of radiation

254
00:20:26,413 --> 00:20:29,000
which would be very hard
to shield against and would be

255
00:20:29,034 --> 00:20:31,448
potentially life-threatening
to a crew.

256
00:20:34,034 --> 00:20:37,655
On top of that,
astronauts would
have to endure

257
00:20:37,689 --> 00:20:41,068
a bombardment
of galactic cosmic radiation.

258
00:20:45,724 --> 00:20:48,379
These are
very high-energy particles,

259
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:52,965
and so you really need,
you know, maybe 10 meters
or more

260
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,310
of liquid water
or liquid hydrogen
to protect you.

261
00:20:57,344 --> 00:20:59,896
So, essentially the way
I like to think about this is,

262
00:20:59,931 --> 00:21:02,758
you're essentially
putting your spacecraft
into a fish tank.

263
00:21:02,793 --> 00:21:05,689
You've got a big fish tank
and you're the goldfish
sitting in the middle.

264
00:21:07,655 --> 00:21:14,827
Once astronauts have
arrived on the surface of Mars
their troubles won't end.

265
00:21:14,862 --> 00:21:18,551
Radiation is more than
12 times that of Earth,

266
00:21:18,586 --> 00:21:21,241
not counting
deadly solar storms.

267
00:21:25,068 --> 00:21:28,862
The reality of a life on Mars
would be sobering.

268
00:21:32,068 --> 00:21:38,103
A crew of hardy astronauts
would hunker down
in radiation-proof bunkers,

269
00:21:38,137 --> 00:21:41,655
enjoying drinks
of recycled urine.

270
00:21:43,827 --> 00:21:47,965
While cities on Mars
seem fantastical,

271
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,482
this kind of rugged outpost
could be within our reach.

272
00:21:57,965 --> 00:22:00,965
There is someone
who thinks it's possible.

273
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,034
But if they ask you
to be a Mars settler,
you had better flee.

274
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:18,931
Space anthropologist,
Taylor Genovese

275
00:22:18,965 --> 00:22:22,310
asked to meet us
in an abandoned missile site,

276
00:22:22,344 --> 00:22:25,758
the most depressing place
he could find.

277
00:22:29,172 --> 00:22:33,241
The reality of going
to another planet

278
00:22:33,275 --> 00:22:37,827
in our current environment,
I think is probably most...

279
00:22:37,862 --> 00:22:41,310
The best analogy is
an Amazon fulfillment center.

280
00:22:41,344 --> 00:22:44,517
You won't be able
to actually see where you are.

281
00:22:44,551 --> 00:22:47,172
You're gonna be
inside of a factory.

282
00:22:47,206 --> 00:22:49,758
And you're not
going to experience

283
00:22:49,793 --> 00:22:51,620
what you think you're
going to be experiencing.

284
00:22:51,655 --> 00:22:54,827
That is, the kind of awe
of being on another planet,

285
00:22:54,862 --> 00:22:58,793
and experiencing
being off of Earth.

286
00:22:58,827 --> 00:23:01,000
No, you're gonna be working
inside of a cubicle.

287
00:23:02,931 --> 00:23:05,275
Despite this
grim outlook,

288
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:08,965
corporate businessmen have
intensified their mission,

289
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,172
forging ahead
with private space programs.

290
00:23:14,241 --> 00:23:20,241
The privatization
of space flight has become
the norm now.

291
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:24,034
You know, Blue Origin
is an offshoot of Amazon.

292
00:23:24,068 --> 00:23:28,413
And we have Virgin Galactic
as an offshoot of the Virgin
conglomerate.

293
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:33,172
So, instead of pushing
into space to explore,

294
00:23:33,206 --> 00:23:37,862
now we're seeing
space corporations
wanting to go into space

295
00:23:37,896 --> 00:23:40,689
solely to exploit
the resources that are there,

296
00:23:40,724 --> 00:23:42,827
wanting to push
people into space,

297
00:23:42,862 --> 00:23:47,517
so that they have a workforce
to control and maintain

298
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:53,034
their corporate
executives' vision
of what space needs to be.

299
00:23:58,172 --> 00:24:01,241
Taylor is concerned
about the implications

300
00:24:01,275 --> 00:24:03,689
of commercial settlements
on Mars.

301
00:24:05,965 --> 00:24:08,137
Let's say we have
a community on Mars.

302
00:24:08,172 --> 00:24:11,172
Musk Town, we'll call it,
is on Mars.

303
00:24:11,206 --> 00:24:17,137
And Elon's back on Earth
because he knows that
it's better to be on a planet

304
00:24:17,172 --> 00:24:19,517
you can breathe on,
and kind of direct

305
00:24:19,551 --> 00:24:21,586
the people
that are in Musk Town.

306
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,862
Let's say they're mining
rare Earth minerals.

307
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:25,689
Something that would be
quite valuable.

308
00:24:25,724 --> 00:24:28,586
And they're starting
to get fed up with

309
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,413
the 12-hour work shifts
or whatever.

310
00:24:31,448 --> 00:24:35,137
The problem that we face
with a private corporation
in that instance

311
00:24:35,172 --> 00:24:39,724
is that they're
in sole control
of that settlement.

312
00:24:39,758 --> 00:24:44,551
What's stopping Papa Elon
from turning off the oxygen?

313
00:24:45,482 --> 00:24:48,724
Or from restricting
food shipments

314
00:24:48,758 --> 00:24:51,068
or restricting
water shipments?

315
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,758
The reason
I'm so cynical about this,

316
00:24:56,793 --> 00:24:59,241
and why I'm talking about
that specifically,

317
00:24:59,275 --> 00:25:03,517
is we're seeing similar
tactics used today in,

318
00:25:03,551 --> 00:25:05,827
for example,
Amazon fulfillment centers.

319
00:25:05,862 --> 00:25:08,241
These same tactics
are being used

320
00:25:08,275 --> 00:25:11,724
in order to quash
justifiable worker grievances.

321
00:25:12,965 --> 00:25:14,310
The difference,
of course, is that

322
00:25:14,344 --> 00:25:16,862
they're here on Earth,
and they can go home.

323
00:25:16,896 --> 00:25:18,862
On Mars, you can't do that.

324
00:25:18,896 --> 00:25:22,724
And with a little bit of...

325
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:27,344
you know, turning the screws
by Elon Musk,

326
00:25:27,379 --> 00:25:34,172
he can essentially turn
his free-market paradise
into a feudal slavery system.

327
00:25:42,448 --> 00:25:45,620
In space terms,
Mars may be close.

328
00:25:45,655 --> 00:25:47,689
But it's fraught
with challenges.

329
00:25:54,758 --> 00:25:57,172
Perhaps it would be
more promising

330
00:25:57,206 --> 00:26:03,068
to look for
a more hospitable place
beyond our solar system.

331
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:07,896
There might be stars
out there orbited
by planets like our own.

332
00:26:15,758 --> 00:26:19,379
We travel to Mauna Kea,
a volcano in Hawaii,

333
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:22,034
site of cutting-edge
telescopes.

334
00:26:24,241 --> 00:26:27,965
Its dizzying altitude
and pitch-dark nights

335
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,172
have made it the mecca
of stargazers.

336
00:26:34,241 --> 00:26:37,379
We meet a former
advisory board member

337
00:26:37,413 --> 00:26:40,379
of Mauna Kea's
Gemini telescope,

338
00:26:40,413 --> 00:26:43,896
renowned astronomer,
Lucianne Walkowicz.

339
00:26:43,931 --> 00:26:48,862
Lucianne is one of the world's
foremost planet hunters.

340
00:26:48,896 --> 00:26:51,655
We look for things that are
maybe the size of Earth.

341
00:26:51,689 --> 00:26:55,137
So, places that could have
these nice, rocky surfaces

342
00:26:55,172 --> 00:26:57,448
that, you know,
have oceans on them.

343
00:26:57,482 --> 00:27:00,689
We look for places that
are the right temperature,

344
00:27:00,724 --> 00:27:02,827
not too hot, not too cold.

345
00:27:02,862 --> 00:27:06,241
We often compare it to
the fairy tale of Goldilocks

346
00:27:06,275 --> 00:27:09,448
and her porridge, right?
Not too hot, not too cold.

347
00:27:09,482 --> 00:27:12,620
And that's 'cause we want
the water to exist
in liquid form.

348
00:27:12,655 --> 00:27:14,310
And that's because
liquid water

349
00:27:14,344 --> 00:27:17,896
is one of the best solutions
for the chemistry of life.

350
00:27:20,724 --> 00:27:23,137
And then we look for
the atmosphere,

351
00:27:23,172 --> 00:27:25,965
and whether the atmosphere
would be likely to have

352
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,137
things like oxygen,
or a balance of different
kinds of atmospheric gases

353
00:27:32,172 --> 00:27:34,344
that would be conducive
to life surviving.

354
00:27:41,758 --> 00:27:44,448
Until the late 2000s,

355
00:27:44,482 --> 00:27:49,931
only a few planets
outside our solar system
had been discovered.

356
00:27:52,517 --> 00:27:56,068
And nobody knew
whether any were like Earth.

357
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,586
But then, everything changed.

358
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,965
One of the most
transformative things

359
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,793
for the discovery of planets
around other stars

360
00:28:09,827 --> 00:28:13,206
was really the Kepler mission,
which launched in 2009.

361
00:28:13,241 --> 00:28:17,206
And I had the great fortune
to be part of the Kepler
science team.

362
00:28:17,241 --> 00:28:20,517
I joined just before launch,
so I got to be present

363
00:28:20,551 --> 00:28:26,551
and experience this
nerve-wracking experience
of seeing your future career

364
00:28:26,586 --> 00:28:29,068
be put on top of
an exploding rocket

365
00:28:29,103 --> 00:28:31,103
that is going to
hurtle it into space.

366
00:28:40,241 --> 00:28:43,344
Lift-off for
the Delta II rocket
with Kepler,

367
00:28:43,379 --> 00:28:46,655
on a search for planets
in some way like our own.

368
00:28:47,896 --> 00:28:50,793
The launch
of the Kepler space telescope

369
00:28:50,827 --> 00:28:55,275
might just be remembered
as the beginning
of the biggest discovery

370
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:58,896
in astronomy in our lifetime,

371
00:28:58,931 --> 00:29:04,931
peering further into space
than any optical telescope
on Earth.

372
00:29:04,965 --> 00:29:08,206
Kepler began its search
for faraway worlds.

373
00:29:12,586 --> 00:29:16,206
And it was really Kepler
that opened its eye,

374
00:29:16,241 --> 00:29:18,827
and then suddenly
started to find

375
00:29:18,862 --> 00:29:23,413
world after world,
these thousands of planets
that we never knew existed,

376
00:29:23,448 --> 00:29:27,448
and that imply the existence
of billions of planets more.

377
00:29:27,482 --> 00:29:29,655
So it really,
really changed
the game

378
00:29:29,689 --> 00:29:32,275
and really opened up
the universe to us.

379
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:46,206
Kepler discovered
that many of these
countless exoplanets

380
00:29:46,241 --> 00:29:48,482
looked strangely familiar.

381
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:53,172
Nobody could
tell you whether there
were other planets

382
00:29:53,206 --> 00:29:56,448
that were even potentially
like Earth out there.

383
00:29:56,482 --> 00:30:03,275
And now, it seems that that
is probably the most common
kind of planet that there is.

384
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:06,482
And we still don't know
whether those planets
are really like Earth,

385
00:30:06,517 --> 00:30:09,448
in the sense that we mean it,
where we can walk around

386
00:30:09,482 --> 00:30:12,206
and enjoy the sunshine
and the breeze

387
00:30:12,241 --> 00:30:13,517
and the wind in our face.

388
00:30:13,551 --> 00:30:15,068
But it does mean that

389
00:30:15,103 --> 00:30:16,965
there are a lot of places
to look for life.

390
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:28,793
Most exciting of all,
exoplanets have been detected
in our neighboring system,

391
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,655
Alpha Centauri.

392
00:30:34,896 --> 00:30:40,965
One of them,
Proxima Centauri b,
is 4.2 light-years away.

393
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,379
In the vastness
of the universe,
that's almost next-door.

394
00:30:49,482 --> 00:30:53,448
But even if this exoplanet
turned out to be habitable,

395
00:30:53,482 --> 00:30:56,482
a flight there
would take 5,000 years.

396
00:31:02,551 --> 00:31:04,275
I think
one of the challenges

397
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:07,965
with the ideas that are
out there for traveling
through space,

398
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,862
these huge distances that,
you know,

399
00:31:09,896 --> 00:31:12,034
we don't have
great solutions for

400
00:31:12,068 --> 00:31:14,827
human beings travelling
within their own lifetime

401
00:31:14,862 --> 00:31:18,206
to even the closest
neighboring planetary systems.

402
00:31:18,241 --> 00:31:21,103
So, there are these ideas
that you could put people

403
00:31:21,137 --> 00:31:23,103
on what we call
generation ships,

404
00:31:23,137 --> 00:31:25,068
where many generations
of people

405
00:31:25,103 --> 00:31:29,275
would live on those ships,
and then perhaps not you,
but your descendants,

406
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,896
or your descendants'
descendants,

407
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:33,000
would one day arrive
at this planetary system.

408
00:31:37,275 --> 00:31:39,551
For this mission
to succeed,

409
00:31:39,586 --> 00:31:45,000
successive generations
would have to live
and die in transit.

410
00:31:51,137 --> 00:31:54,172
Unless science can find
a better solution.

411
00:32:02,206 --> 00:32:06,827
In the movies,
interstellar astronauts
are deep-frozen

412
00:32:06,862 --> 00:32:10,655
and resuscitated when
they reach their destination.

413
00:32:12,965 --> 00:32:16,172
There are major institutions
around the world

414
00:32:16,206 --> 00:32:19,379
who are taking this cue
from science fiction.

415
00:32:23,586 --> 00:32:28,517
At the European Space Agency's
medical lab in Cologne,

416
00:32:28,551 --> 00:32:31,344
space surgeon,
Adrianos Golemis

417
00:32:31,379 --> 00:32:37,517
is at the forefront
of how to ready astronauts
for interstellar voyages.

418
00:32:37,551 --> 00:32:41,172
Wouldn't it be great
when humanity ventures
further into the cosmos,

419
00:32:41,206 --> 00:32:43,413
to use the concept
of hibernation?

420
00:32:43,448 --> 00:32:45,758
This is something we observe
in the animal kingdom.

421
00:32:45,793 --> 00:32:48,344
And there's definitely a lot
we can learn from nature.

422
00:32:48,379 --> 00:32:52,655
So, what we know is that
when animals hibernate,
they use less energy,

423
00:32:52,689 --> 00:32:54,689
and for a long period of time,

424
00:32:54,724 --> 00:32:57,172
with less energy,
they can survive.

425
00:32:57,206 --> 00:32:59,206
That's very practical
for space flight.

426
00:32:59,241 --> 00:33:02,310
Because imagine
if you want to go on
a very long-duration mission.

427
00:33:02,344 --> 00:33:06,758
Then if you are in
a hibernated state,
you would need less food.

428
00:33:11,034 --> 00:33:13,310
So, the device
I am in right now,

429
00:33:13,344 --> 00:33:16,724
it's based on the concept
of indirect calorimetry.

430
00:33:16,758 --> 00:33:18,206
What does this mean?

431
00:33:18,241 --> 00:33:22,931
Calorimetry, so it
measures how much energy
does my body need per day.

432
00:33:22,965 --> 00:33:25,379
It's indirect, because this
is actually measured

433
00:33:25,413 --> 00:33:27,206
by the air that I breathe
in and out.

434
00:33:27,241 --> 00:33:28,379
That's why I'm in this canopy.

435
00:33:28,413 --> 00:33:30,034
In the future,
we can assume that

436
00:33:30,068 --> 00:33:35,586
we will use the same concept
to calculate how much energy
does the body need

437
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,586
also for hibernation.

438
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:40,931
We know it's gonna be less
than the energy we use
in everyday life.

439
00:33:40,965 --> 00:33:43,103
But as every person
is different,

440
00:33:43,137 --> 00:33:45,413
so one astronaut is different
to another one,

441
00:33:45,448 --> 00:33:49,482
we need to calculate
precisely how much energy
would I need to fly

442
00:33:49,517 --> 00:33:53,931
or much energy would you need,
actually, to fly in space,
in a hibernated state.

443
00:33:56,896 --> 00:34:01,137
Lifeless like
Snow White in a Perspex box,

444
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:04,758
one wonders what
the astronauts might feel.

445
00:34:07,206 --> 00:34:10,172
Essentially it's like
a state of deep sleep.

446
00:34:10,206 --> 00:34:14,586
But, again,
this is what we know
from researching animals,

447
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:18,379
and people that, for example,
go into major surgery.

448
00:34:18,413 --> 00:34:20,103
I do not know
if we will have dreams.

449
00:34:20,137 --> 00:34:23,068
We have to ask
the future astronauts on that.

450
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:27,000
The next step
sounds straight from
a Hollywood script.

451
00:34:27,034 --> 00:34:31,793
Interstellar travelers
could be put into
suspended animation.

452
00:34:35,275 --> 00:34:39,034
Incredibly, this is already
being done today.

453
00:34:39,068 --> 00:34:42,931
But the people pioneering
these radical methods

454
00:34:42,965 --> 00:34:46,034
have nothing to do with
space exploration.

455
00:34:46,068 --> 00:34:49,172
...0.50 now,
he is not breathing.

456
00:34:49,827 --> 00:34:51,206
One, two, three.

457
00:34:52,206 --> 00:34:54,758
At the Maryland
Medical Center,

458
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:58,344
pioneering surgeons
have masterminded

459
00:34:58,379 --> 00:35:03,724
an innovative procedure
for severe gunshot wounds.

460
00:35:03,758 --> 00:35:07,448
We have
a young male,
multiple gunshot wounds,

461
00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:10,758
penetrating injuries
to the right shoulder region

462
00:35:10,793 --> 00:35:13,724
and two penetrating injuries
to the lower abdomen.

463
00:35:13,758 --> 00:35:16,586
-Could we please order
a massive transfusion?

464
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:23,827
Patients with
extreme bullet injuries have
a survival rate of just 7%.

465
00:35:23,862 --> 00:35:27,758
There just isn't enough time
to fix their wounds.

466
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:30,275
I think
he's in hemorrhagic...
Oh, he's arrested.

467
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:31,137
Asystole.

468
00:35:34,241 --> 00:35:37,482
Doctors
are working on ways
around the problem.

469
00:35:40,482 --> 00:35:43,448
In order to buy
40 minutes of time,

470
00:35:43,482 --> 00:35:49,068
they have devised a procedure
to slow down the metabolism
of their patients.

471
00:35:50,551 --> 00:35:55,172
By cooling patients rapidly,
they protect the whole body.

472
00:35:57,413 --> 00:36:01,758
The unique aspect
here is that we're preserving
not only specific organs,

473
00:36:01,793 --> 00:36:04,034
but the entire body
and multiple organs,

474
00:36:04,068 --> 00:36:06,896
including the brain,
liver, heart, lungs

475
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:10,793
and all the other
essential organs,
including the intestines.

476
00:36:10,827 --> 00:36:12,724
Okay, we're gonna
cool him down to 20.

477
00:36:15,068 --> 00:36:18,896
Doctors
replace the blood
with a saline solution,

478
00:36:18,931 --> 00:36:24,172
cooled to 20 degrees Celsius
or 68 degrees Fahrenheit.

479
00:36:28,206 --> 00:36:32,827
Within minutes,
the patient has entered
a state of hypothermia.

480
00:36:36,586 --> 00:36:41,241
This procedure could be
the nucleus of a revolution
in space travel.

481
00:36:43,862 --> 00:36:46,896
I think
we're doing the groundwork,
the fundamentals here,

482
00:36:46,931 --> 00:36:52,310
so I do think that cooling
would be a part, for sure,
of any prolonged

483
00:36:52,344 --> 00:36:56,000
suspended animation
or travel of some sort.

484
00:36:56,034 --> 00:36:58,758
If you can reduce
the body's demand

485
00:36:58,793 --> 00:37:02,137
for oxygen and food
and stuff like that,

486
00:37:02,172 --> 00:37:04,655
then you can go further
and further out

487
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:08,620
in a space situation,
by doing that, so...

488
00:37:08,655 --> 00:37:12,620
It may not end up
being the final result,

489
00:37:12,655 --> 00:37:16,344
but I think that that
temperature will play
a role in that.

490
00:37:19,931 --> 00:37:22,413
On interstellar
space missions,

491
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:27,655
the suspended animation
would have to last for months,
even years.

492
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:30,689
But there is a problem.

493
00:37:32,655 --> 00:37:36,724
So there's a buildup
of a lot of potassium
and acid.

494
00:37:36,758 --> 00:37:40,413
And to successfully
navigate that,

495
00:37:40,448 --> 00:37:44,448
there would need to also be
a process to manage that

496
00:37:45,655 --> 00:37:49,034
and remove the potassium
and neutralize the acid.

497
00:37:52,758 --> 00:37:56,448
To use this method
for long-term space flights,

498
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:59,137
scientists need to control
the buildup

499
00:37:59,172 --> 00:38:03,586
of acidic waste products
in the cooled astronauts.

500
00:38:07,137 --> 00:38:10,482
So far, this seems
to be impossible.

501
00:38:20,689 --> 00:38:24,551
Even if you could find
a way to freeze humans,

502
00:38:24,586 --> 00:38:28,965
a trip of many millennia would
be far from plain sailing.

503
00:38:31,689 --> 00:38:36,931
Some crew members
would have to be awake
to watch over the spacecraft

504
00:38:36,965 --> 00:38:39,689
and the passenger
support systems.

505
00:38:44,137 --> 00:38:47,586
To keep the mission
going across the centuries,

506
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:52,206
the crew would have
to renew itself
by having children.

507
00:38:54,172 --> 00:38:57,827
But conceiving offspring
in space is challenging.

508
00:38:58,689 --> 00:39:01,034
In the confines
of a spaceship,

509
00:39:01,068 --> 00:39:04,758
astronauts would have
a limited choice of partners.

510
00:39:20,896 --> 00:39:26,275
Back in Colorado,
there's a man with concerns
about procreating like this.

511
00:39:33,275 --> 00:39:37,137
Simon Dube,
a leading space sexologist,

512
00:39:37,172 --> 00:39:40,344
is worried about
interstellar inbreeding.

513
00:39:42,586 --> 00:39:46,275
If we don't have enough
people on these space flights
or colonies,

514
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:47,827
it's going to create
a situation where

515
00:39:47,862 --> 00:39:50,000
some individuals will
have to reproduce

516
00:39:50,034 --> 00:39:54,551
with people who have
DNA that are closely
related to one another.

517
00:39:54,586 --> 00:39:58,758
This increases the risk
of genetic diseases
or congenital malformation.

518
00:40:01,068 --> 00:40:03,517
In a situation where
we have long-term

519
00:40:03,551 --> 00:40:05,413
multi-generational
space flight,

520
00:40:05,448 --> 00:40:10,620
we need to find ways
to bring enough genetic
diversity to our sample.

521
00:40:11,931 --> 00:40:15,206
Refreshing
the gene pool would
be essential.

522
00:40:15,241 --> 00:40:18,965
Or, after 5,000 years
of inbreeding,

523
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,482
the crew would arrive
transformed
into bizarre mutants.

524
00:40:25,827 --> 00:40:29,172
Estimates vary
as to how many colonists

525
00:40:29,206 --> 00:40:31,655
would ensure
a healthy gene mix.

526
00:40:33,137 --> 00:40:34,620
Researchers
have estimated

527
00:40:34,655 --> 00:40:39,586
that we might need
up to 40,000 individuals
or maybe even less than 100.

528
00:40:40,482 --> 00:40:42,620
Those who argue
for small numbers

529
00:40:42,655 --> 00:40:44,862
usually take into account
that in these situations,

530
00:40:44,896 --> 00:40:47,206
we might wanna use
genetic technology.

531
00:40:47,241 --> 00:40:49,206
So, for instance,
bringing with us a bank

532
00:40:49,241 --> 00:40:52,310
of fertilized eggs
that will be progressively
implemented

533
00:40:52,344 --> 00:40:56,448
to provide that genetic
diversity in the colony
or aboard the spaceships.

534
00:40:58,551 --> 00:41:06,034
But genetic health
isn't the only sex issue
we need to deal with in space.

535
00:41:06,068 --> 00:41:09,241
Space imposes
all kinds of challenges
on human sexuality,

536
00:41:09,275 --> 00:41:11,413
including partnered sex.

537
00:41:11,448 --> 00:41:15,068
So one of them is the fact
that there's no gravity,

538
00:41:15,103 --> 00:41:17,758
so in zero gravity
or microgravity,

539
00:41:17,793 --> 00:41:21,448
it might be difficult
to bring partners close
to one another,

540
00:41:21,482 --> 00:41:24,827
because each time one
pushes the other,
or makes a movement,

541
00:41:24,862 --> 00:41:28,310
it will propel
the other person away.

542
00:41:28,344 --> 00:41:32,620
So we need to find
contraptions, garments,
or technical systems

543
00:41:32,655 --> 00:41:35,103
to keep people close
from one another,

544
00:41:35,137 --> 00:41:38,103
so that they can enjoy
sexual activities together.

545
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:44,586
Undeterred
by such perplexing matters,

546
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:49,862
Simon thinks one shouldn't
view space sex
as a problem.

547
00:41:49,896 --> 00:41:54,000
Imagine what it would mean
to be weightless
for human sexuality.

548
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,965
You could move around.

549
00:41:59,103 --> 00:42:04,655
In zero gravity,
you can enjoy
sexual activities,

550
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:06,172
including with multiple
partners,

551
00:42:07,965 --> 00:42:09,448
in total weightlessness.

552
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:14,172
What would that mean
for our sexual behavior,

553
00:42:14,206 --> 00:42:17,275
our preferences
and our fantasies?

554
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:21,068
I think in a space context,
it would completely
change them

555
00:42:21,103 --> 00:42:24,724
and enable new frontiers
for human sexuality.

556
00:42:33,931 --> 00:42:36,620
Despite
these hopeful prospects,

557
00:42:36,655 --> 00:42:41,310
scientists sending
out colonists
in generation ships

558
00:42:41,344 --> 00:42:45,000
will have to deal
with our bodies.

559
00:42:45,034 --> 00:42:48,310
We are just too frail
to thrive away from Earth.

560
00:42:50,724 --> 00:42:54,827
But, astonishingly,
there is a man
in New York City

561
00:42:54,862 --> 00:42:57,896
who's certain he can
overcome this obstacle.

562
00:43:00,965 --> 00:43:04,620
We meet the NASA geneticist
Christopher Mason

563
00:43:04,655 --> 00:43:08,586
in his laboratory
at Weill Cornell
Medical College.

564
00:43:10,448 --> 00:43:12,655
He knows what
he's up against.

565
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,689
The human body
was never built for space.

566
00:43:16,724 --> 00:43:19,655
There are extraordinarily
difficult terrains

567
00:43:19,689 --> 00:43:21,862
and environments
that we would have
to survive in,

568
00:43:21,896 --> 00:43:26,517
so, sulfuric acid rain
or crushing gravity
or radiation,

569
00:43:26,551 --> 00:43:29,068
that would kill a person
in less than a day.

570
00:43:29,103 --> 00:43:31,000
Even within our solar system,
there's places
we've already seen

571
00:43:31,034 --> 00:43:34,068
that are completely
inhospitable to human life

572
00:43:34,103 --> 00:43:36,034
and we have to find
a way around them.

573
00:43:36,068 --> 00:43:38,517
For every astronaut
that's gone into space, ever,

574
00:43:38,551 --> 00:43:42,275
we have considered physical
protective measures,
pharmacological measures,

575
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:44,827
to keep them safe
and keep them healthy
and active.

576
00:43:44,862 --> 00:43:47,379
But we now are
on the cusp
of actually implementing

577
00:43:47,413 --> 00:43:50,965
genetic measures,
actually, cellular changes,
that can keep them safe.

578
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,655
So, instead of just having
defenses on the outside
of the body,

579
00:43:53,689 --> 00:43:56,965
we can activate defenses
that are already present
on the inside of the body

580
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,137
and even add new ones.

581
00:44:00,724 --> 00:44:03,068
Up until
a few years ago,

582
00:44:03,103 --> 00:44:06,862
editing the human gene
was science fiction.

583
00:44:06,896 --> 00:44:10,310
Today, geneticists
are on the verge

584
00:44:10,344 --> 00:44:14,000
of making humans fit
for interstellar travel.

585
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:21,620
The most damaging
threat is radiation.

586
00:44:21,655 --> 00:44:25,379
The biggest risk
of radiation is that it
damages your DNA and proteins

587
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:27,068
and doesn't let
your cells survive.

588
00:44:27,103 --> 00:44:31,862
So, what we do
is take proteins
from our own DNA,

589
00:44:31,896 --> 00:44:35,275
our own genome
and also from other creatures,
like tardigrades

590
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:38,896
and take those snippets
of genes we know that give
additional protection

591
00:44:38,931 --> 00:44:40,655
and we basically
copy them out,
clone them

592
00:44:40,689 --> 00:44:42,103
and then put them
into human cells.

593
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:51,931
Christopher
Mason particularly
enjoys snipping genes

594
00:44:51,965 --> 00:44:55,689
from these droll
micro-animals,
tardigrades.

595
00:44:58,689 --> 00:45:02,482
Tardigrades are these
cute little tiny water bears,
they're often called,

596
00:45:02,517 --> 00:45:04,275
because they look
like a little bear.

597
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:06,724
And they are a species
that is found in soils

598
00:45:06,758 --> 00:45:08,620
and surfaces
all over the Earth.

599
00:45:08,655 --> 00:45:11,448
They're just small,
little multicellular
little bears,

600
00:45:11,482 --> 00:45:13,931
that can survive
almost anywhere.

601
00:45:13,965 --> 00:45:16,689
High radiation,
they can survive
the vacuum of space,

602
00:45:16,724 --> 00:45:18,931
even come back
and then be rehydrated.

603
00:45:18,965 --> 00:45:21,206
They can survive
dry conditions.

604
00:45:21,241 --> 00:45:24,000
So they're really
extraordinary creatures.

605
00:45:24,034 --> 00:45:26,827
So, now let's go see
if we can check on the cells.

606
00:45:26,862 --> 00:45:30,655
Now, let's see
how the tardigrade
and human cells are doing.

607
00:45:30,689 --> 00:45:32,413
Take a peek at Craig,
who should be in here.

608
00:45:33,275 --> 00:45:34,827
-Hey, Craig.
-Hey.

609
00:45:34,862 --> 00:45:36,931
All right,
so how do they look?

610
00:45:36,965 --> 00:45:38,655
Yeah, we're just spinning
them down right now.

611
00:45:38,689 --> 00:45:40,620
Allowing
the centrifuge
to spin down, great.

612
00:45:44,655 --> 00:45:47,655
These cells
floating in this pink bath

613
00:45:47,689 --> 00:45:52,344
of nutrients, belong
to no species ever known.

614
00:45:52,379 --> 00:45:58,758
They are a completely
artificial blend
of water bear and human.

615
00:45:58,793 --> 00:46:03,000
We've made human cells
that carry the lessons
from the tardigrade

616
00:46:03,034 --> 00:46:06,000
inside their DNA
and enable it to resist

617
00:46:06,034 --> 00:46:09,310
up to 80% more
radiation than they
could before.

618
00:46:09,344 --> 00:46:13,827
All human
cells which carry
the radiation-resistant gene

619
00:46:13,862 --> 00:46:18,724
of tardigrades will
light up under the microscope.

620
00:46:18,758 --> 00:46:21,551
Christopher Mason
is delighted to see

621
00:46:21,586 --> 00:46:24,620
that the experiment
has worked out.

622
00:46:24,655 --> 00:46:31,000
Opening up a pathway
to even more fanciful
genetic modifications.

623
00:46:31,034 --> 00:46:34,827
One of the challenges
is that you have very low
light in long space flight,

624
00:46:34,862 --> 00:46:36,689
you have limited resources.

625
00:46:36,724 --> 00:46:39,689
So what if you captured
every photon and turned
it into food?

626
00:46:39,724 --> 00:46:43,241
Or what if we could have
chlorophyll inside
human cells?

627
00:46:43,275 --> 00:46:46,068
Really like chloro-humans,
or plants, basically.

628
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:49,068
What if we could just
lay out in the sun
when you're hungry,

629
00:46:49,103 --> 00:46:51,896
get enough nutrients
and then go back in the shade
when you're all full.

630
00:46:51,931 --> 00:46:56,068
To do this in space,
you would need about two
tennis courts' worth of skin

631
00:46:56,103 --> 00:46:58,586
to lay out and get
enough sunlight,

632
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:01,551
on Earth at least,
to get enough food
for one day.

633
00:47:01,586 --> 00:47:05,862
So if you could imagine
having that much skin
you could kind of roll it out,

634
00:47:05,896 --> 00:47:09,965
let it absorb and then roll
it back in, kind of like
a portable solar panel.

635
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,103
Except it's your own skin.

636
00:47:18,793 --> 00:47:22,896
This new
space superhuman
would know no limits.

637
00:47:22,931 --> 00:47:27,448
It will breathe helium
and dive into
the Boomerang Nebula.

638
00:47:30,137 --> 00:47:34,000
That is, if it ever
sees the light of day.

639
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:39,344
Our lab
has a 500-year plan
to enact this dream

640
00:47:39,379 --> 00:47:42,000
of having humans survive
under the light of a new sun.

641
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,034
I will be dead
for the vast majority
of this plan,

642
00:47:46,068 --> 00:47:47,793
but the point
is that we've laid out

643
00:47:47,827 --> 00:47:49,931
what can happen
and I think should happen.

644
00:47:52,275 --> 00:47:54,586
We've learned a lot
about genetics
in the past ten years,

645
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:56,310
that's phase one.

646
00:47:56,344 --> 00:48:00,206
In the next 20 years,
we actually take these lessons
and knowledge of genetics

647
00:48:00,241 --> 00:48:02,551
and engineer these cells,
engineer genomes

648
00:48:02,586 --> 00:48:05,034
to contain lessons
from other creatures

649
00:48:05,068 --> 00:48:06,931
to help them survive
extreme environments.

650
00:48:06,965 --> 00:48:09,068
And by phase ten,
in 500 years,
we actually launch.

651
00:48:09,103 --> 00:48:13,965
We will have had the knowledge
of genetics to know what to do
to protect the astronauts

652
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,241
and we'll have the exoplanets
discovered so we know
to where we can send them.

653
00:48:23,103 --> 00:48:29,275
But if genetically
enhanced humans ever ventured
out to conquer the galaxy,

654
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:33,862
they would have to adapt
not just their bodies
but their minds.

655
00:48:36,379 --> 00:48:40,310
And that might be an even
more vexing issue.

656
00:48:40,344 --> 00:48:43,206
Our challenge
would be to stay sane.

657
00:48:43,241 --> 00:48:48,000
locked for generations
in a ship on course
into the unknown.

658
00:48:55,413 --> 00:48:58,793
Space anthropologist,
Taylor Genovese,

659
00:48:58,827 --> 00:49:02,172
is convinced we'd be
at each other's throats

660
00:49:02,206 --> 00:49:04,379
before we even
reached halfway.

661
00:49:07,034 --> 00:49:13,689
The day-to-day of living,
as anyone who
has cohabited knows,

662
00:49:13,724 --> 00:49:16,931
the smallest of irritants

663
00:49:16,965 --> 00:49:21,103
can explode
into dramatic fights.

664
00:49:21,137 --> 00:49:26,275
Somebody clinks
their fork on a plate
the wrong way,

665
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:27,862
can explode into a fight.

666
00:49:27,896 --> 00:49:31,103
The problem becomes
you can't escape it,

667
00:49:31,137 --> 00:49:33,620
you can't remove
yourself to cool down,

668
00:49:33,655 --> 00:49:36,137
because you're always
in close proximity.

669
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,827
The Antarctic stations
are really great

670
00:49:44,862 --> 00:49:48,758
because you can see
how people are going to react

671
00:49:48,793 --> 00:49:51,793
within a very
hostile environment.

672
00:49:51,827 --> 00:49:56,448
In the past few years
there was an apparent issue
that someone on a Russian crew

673
00:49:56,482 --> 00:50:00,655
was giving away the endings
of the books from the library

674
00:50:00,689 --> 00:50:03,482
to another Russian
crew member on purpose,

675
00:50:03,517 --> 00:50:06,068
maliciously telling him
the ends of books.

676
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:11,275
So much so, that then
the other crew member
could no longer take it,

677
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:13,551
went into the kitchen,
grabbed a butcher knife

678
00:50:13,586 --> 00:50:15,517
and stabbed
the other crew member.

679
00:50:15,551 --> 00:50:20,931
And they needed
to then, of course,
evacuate them out.

680
00:50:20,965 --> 00:50:24,413
But in outer space,
you're not gonna
be able to have that.

681
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:31,655
Even more dangerously,
if somebody gets very angry

682
00:50:31,689 --> 00:50:36,034
and decides to, say,
open an airlock
or puncture something

683
00:50:36,068 --> 00:50:38,034
in the settlement
or the spacecraft

684
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:40,172
then that endangers
everybody on board.

685
00:50:40,206 --> 00:50:43,000
There are going
to be problems.

686
00:50:43,034 --> 00:50:45,379
There are going
to be issues
between people.

687
00:50:45,413 --> 00:50:49,482
And how are we going
to deal with this?
It's not being talked about.

688
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:05,689
While mental health
on long-term space missions
is a taboo subject

689
00:51:05,724 --> 00:51:08,344
it has been researched
in the past.

690
00:51:10,689 --> 00:51:14,586
In New Jersey, we meet someone
who was a guinea pig

691
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:19,862
in a Moscow
isolation experiment
in the 1990s.

692
00:51:21,793 --> 00:51:26,655
For the first time,
Canadian nursing professor
Judith Lapierre

693
00:51:26,689 --> 00:51:29,724
breaks her silence
on the Russian study

694
00:51:29,758 --> 00:51:32,551
that was to create
an international scandal.

695
00:51:34,344 --> 00:51:40,137
I was very enthusiastic
about getting involved
in such a big project

696
00:51:40,172 --> 00:51:45,827
because at that time,
it represented the longest
confinement studies

697
00:51:45,862 --> 00:51:49,310
with an international crew
and a mixed-gender crew.

698
00:51:49,344 --> 00:51:53,000
So I was really excited
and proud. This was
a dream come true, actually.

699
00:51:56,793 --> 00:52:00,103
The experiment involved
Judith being locked up

700
00:52:00,137 --> 00:52:06,137
in a large,
metal barrel
for 110 days.

701
00:52:06,172 --> 00:52:12,068
She and the group of men
would live there confined
and observed around the clock.

702
00:52:14,827 --> 00:52:18,931
Judith Lapierre felt primed
for the challenge.

703
00:52:21,137 --> 00:52:23,931
I'm the woman
taking part in this crew

704
00:52:23,965 --> 00:52:27,344
so we are training now
for the starting
of the experiment.

705
00:52:28,862 --> 00:52:32,310
I would have loved, of course,
there would be more women

706
00:52:32,344 --> 00:52:35,103
because I think
it would be great
for me as support, also,

707
00:52:35,137 --> 00:52:40,137
and real life is
involving both genders,
so there should be more,

708
00:52:40,172 --> 00:52:42,103
but unfortunately,
there's only one so far.

709
00:52:44,827 --> 00:52:51,103
On December 4, 1999,
Judith was ready
to be locked in the barrel

710
00:52:51,137 --> 00:52:56,827
as part of an international
crew that was to join
a Russian crew inside.

711
00:52:58,827 --> 00:53:04,137
I remember following
each other in a line
and going inside the chamber,

712
00:53:04,172 --> 00:53:09,379
closing the doors
and there we were starting
our 110 days' mission.

713
00:53:09,413 --> 00:53:14,241
And it was a very intense
schedule, we had over
100 studies to run.

714
00:53:14,275 --> 00:53:18,206
and the days
would last from 8:00
until 10:00 at night.

715
00:53:21,793 --> 00:53:24,827
Judith settled
into her new life,

716
00:53:24,862 --> 00:53:29,103
comfortably dropping
into a work routine
with her colleagues.

717
00:53:34,896 --> 00:53:40,137
From the control room
the supervisors witnessed
how the crew bonded.

718
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:48,379
Nobody had the slightest
notion that the experiment
was to go disastrously wrong.

719
00:53:52,379 --> 00:53:55,586
The ambience and the dynamic
of the chamber changed

720
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:58,379
that evening
of New Year's, 2000.

721
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:02,620
It was a kind
of a celebration
of course,

722
00:54:02,655 --> 00:54:05,000
we had an initial
meal together

723
00:54:06,586 --> 00:54:12,551
and a little after midnight,
there was a fight
between Russian crew members.

724
00:54:12,586 --> 00:54:15,931
It was a very violent
and aggressive fight

725
00:54:15,965 --> 00:54:18,655
that left one
crew member
very injured.

726
00:54:21,482 --> 00:54:25,206
Judith expected
the men in the control room
to intervene...

727
00:54:27,689 --> 00:54:29,379
but no one came.

728
00:54:33,448 --> 00:54:36,000
This was just one
part of an evening

729
00:54:36,034 --> 00:54:39,551
that was to spiral
much further
out of control.

730
00:54:41,137 --> 00:54:43,689
We couldn't sleep
after those incidents

731
00:54:43,724 --> 00:54:45,310
so we stayed
in the living room.

732
00:54:45,344 --> 00:54:50,586
And then the Russian
crew member
was starting to make jokes

733
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:54,724
about doing an experiment
that would involve myself.

734
00:54:54,758 --> 00:55:00,758
He had stopped smoking
and he wanted to test
kissing without smoking,

735
00:55:00,793 --> 00:55:04,655
in front of everybody.
So I said, "No way,

736
00:55:04,689 --> 00:55:07,551
I'm not gonna take part
in any of this,
what do you mean?"

737
00:55:07,586 --> 00:55:13,448
And he pulled me up
from my chair.
I sat down again.

738
00:55:13,482 --> 00:55:18,137
He pulled me again
and I looked at my friends,
my commander, saying,

739
00:55:18,172 --> 00:55:20,689
"What's he doing now,
he's pulling me out?"

740
00:55:20,724 --> 00:55:23,206
you know, to go
in the kitchen area again.

741
00:55:23,241 --> 00:55:27,862
That's when he decided
that he would kiss me forcibly

742
00:55:27,896 --> 00:55:31,793
and I pushed him away,
he did again
and I pushed him.

743
00:55:31,827 --> 00:55:36,068
And I left the kitchen,
went back to my colleagues

744
00:55:36,103 --> 00:55:39,068
and I was in shock
because that whole evening

745
00:55:39,103 --> 00:55:42,448
had a whole
atmosphere already
and I couldn't believe it.

746
00:55:53,068 --> 00:55:55,931
The next day we did write
to mission control

747
00:55:55,965 --> 00:55:58,310
and to our respective
space agencies.

748
00:55:58,344 --> 00:56:01,206
And it took
until four
to five days,

749
00:56:01,241 --> 00:56:06,310
they sent to us
a paper through
the hatch doors

750
00:56:06,344 --> 00:56:09,551
and they told us
you should sign this

751
00:56:09,586 --> 00:56:11,551
or you may leave,
you're free to go.

752
00:56:11,586 --> 00:56:16,758
And so we were
kind of forced to sign
if we wanted to stay.

753
00:56:16,793 --> 00:56:18,689
And, of course,
I wanted to stay.

754
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:23,620
The paper
Judith signed

755
00:56:23,655 --> 00:56:28,103
said that the incident
was just a cultural
misunderstanding.

756
00:56:29,896 --> 00:56:35,620
And I can't say no to that.
It was a sexual interest
that he had in me

757
00:56:35,655 --> 00:56:39,793
and he forcibly
kissed me twice
and I rejected him.

758
00:56:39,827 --> 00:56:42,551
But it was not
recognized as such

759
00:56:42,586 --> 00:56:46,827
and it was just minimized as
a cultural misunderstanding.

760
00:56:46,862 --> 00:56:51,068
Saying that I wasn't
open enough to
cultural diversity.

761
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:00,137
When that mission finished,

762
00:57:01,413 --> 00:57:03,758
it really influenced
my whole career,

763
00:57:03,793 --> 00:57:07,586
because I thought
this would be the start
of my research project

764
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:11,655
with the Space Agency
or the start of my field
of work.

765
00:57:11,689 --> 00:57:15,724
But I was just totally
pushed out of the system.

766
00:57:15,758 --> 00:57:20,137
And I have not been involved
in any space work ever since.

767
00:57:34,655 --> 00:57:38,241
Drawing on
the experience
of Judith Lapierre,

768
00:57:38,275 --> 00:57:41,965
one concludes that hurtling
through the centuries

769
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:47,241
in a spaceship,
would end in strife,
crime and depravity.

770
00:57:54,896 --> 00:57:59,034
If we are to stand a chance
to reach exoplanets,

771
00:57:59,068 --> 00:58:02,965
we need to figure out how
to get there in a lifetime.

772
00:58:04,965 --> 00:58:08,517
But could we invent
a spacecraft fast enough?

773
00:58:17,034 --> 00:58:20,620
In Idaho, we are back
with Marshall Savage,

774
00:58:20,655 --> 00:58:24,689
visionary science educator
and futurologist.

775
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:31,724
Marshall has an idea
how we can supercharge
future spacecraft.

776
00:58:34,793 --> 00:58:39,000
Einstein taught us
energy and matter
are inter-exchangeable,

777
00:58:39,034 --> 00:58:42,551
and a very little bit
of matter is a huge amount
of energy.

778
00:58:42,586 --> 00:58:46,586
But the only real,
viable way to make
that conversion,

779
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:49,206
to get all the energy
out of a piece of matter,

780
00:58:49,241 --> 00:58:50,689
is by having antimatter.

781
00:58:50,724 --> 00:58:53,379
Because when matter
and antimatter meet,

782
00:58:53,413 --> 00:58:56,793
they annihilate each other
and the result is pure energy.

783
00:58:58,931 --> 00:59:03,448
So, if you could manufacture
and store enough antimatter,

784
00:59:03,482 --> 00:59:08,137
it then becomes possible
to have energy on the scale
of photon propulsion.

785
00:59:08,172 --> 00:59:12,103
What that means is that
instead of hot chemicals
coming out of the rocket,

786
00:59:12,137 --> 00:59:15,413
or fast fusion particles
coming out of the rocket,

787
00:59:15,448 --> 00:59:17,862
you have photons
coming out of the rocket,

788
00:59:17,896 --> 00:59:19,275
and they're traveling
at the speed of light.

789
00:59:29,551 --> 00:59:34,034
Antimatter fuel
would get us around
the galaxy in no time.

790
00:59:40,931 --> 00:59:43,551
As impossible as it may sound,

791
00:59:43,586 --> 00:59:49,862
antimatter is both
already manufactured
and stored on Earth today.

792
00:59:49,896 --> 00:59:55,241
In Geneva,
physicist Michael Doser
harvests antimatter

793
00:59:55,275 --> 00:59:57,896
at the particle
accelerator, CERN.

794
00:59:59,655 --> 01:00:03,689
It's actually pretty easy
to make antimatter
and to work with it.

795
01:00:03,724 --> 01:00:06,413
All you need is
a Proton Synchrotron,

796
01:00:06,448 --> 01:00:09,551
where you accelerate particles
to very high energies,

797
01:00:09,586 --> 01:00:12,413
smash those into
a block of iridium,

798
01:00:12,448 --> 01:00:15,000
and if you're really lucky,
one in a million,

799
01:00:15,034 --> 01:00:17,551
you get a pair
of a proton
and antiproton.

800
01:00:17,586 --> 01:00:21,241
These antiprotons are moving
almost at the speed of light,

801
01:00:21,275 --> 01:00:22,689
rush into this building,

802
01:00:22,724 --> 01:00:25,758
and are then slowed down
in the structures
that you can see here.

803
01:00:25,793 --> 01:00:29,896
So, there's a big
decelerator surrounding
the building itself,

804
01:00:29,931 --> 01:00:31,448
underneath
the concrete blocks.

805
01:00:31,482 --> 01:00:35,000
Then they go down into
this little ring here,

806
01:00:35,034 --> 01:00:36,482
which is the final stage,

807
01:00:36,517 --> 01:00:39,827
which slows them down
to such low energies
that we can catch them.

808
01:00:44,827 --> 01:00:49,275
Making antimatter
is easy, if you happen
to be at CERN,

809
01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:53,206
the world's largest
nuclear research facility.

810
01:00:53,241 --> 01:00:58,068
The center hosts scientists
from 85 nations

811
01:00:58,103 --> 01:01:03,482
and consumes more electricity
than 300,000 homes a year.

812
01:01:11,137 --> 01:01:16,000
CERN might be the home
of some of the biggest
hardware ever built,

813
01:01:16,034 --> 01:01:20,689
but in particle physics
some of the most
impressive gear

814
01:01:20,724 --> 01:01:22,275
can be quite unassuming.

815
01:01:24,551 --> 01:01:28,034
This is the heart
of the matter,
or of the antimatter.

816
01:01:28,068 --> 01:01:30,206
This is what an antimatter
trap looks like,

817
01:01:30,241 --> 01:01:34,172
and this is, in fact,
a trap that we used about
10,15 years ago.

818
01:01:34,206 --> 01:01:36,379
And what you see here is

819
01:01:36,413 --> 01:01:39,413
something that will hold
antimatter without touching
any matter.

820
01:01:39,448 --> 01:01:42,655
Because, of course, when
antimatter and matter touch,
they annihilate.

821
01:01:42,689 --> 01:01:45,172
So we need to hold
the antimatter in vacuum,

822
01:01:45,206 --> 01:01:48,655
and only touch it
with electric fields
and magnetic fields.

823
01:01:52,275 --> 01:01:56,310
Unfortunately,
the amount of energy required

824
01:01:56,344 --> 01:01:59,931
to make antimatter
is enormous.

825
01:01:59,965 --> 01:02:06,000
120 gigawatts are
needed to create even
the tiniest amounts

826
01:02:06,034 --> 01:02:08,310
of this mysterious substance.

827
01:02:09,172 --> 01:02:11,758
And the output
is ridiculously low.

828
01:02:13,965 --> 01:02:17,034
All the antimatter
produced at CERN

829
01:02:17,068 --> 01:02:19,482
wouldn't power
a single lightbulb.

830
01:02:23,896 --> 01:02:29,103
Michael Doser works
with only minute quantities
of antimatter.

831
01:02:31,344 --> 01:02:33,965
And there is another problem.

832
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,344
The sheer amount
of time required to
manufacture antimatter.

833
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:45,724
At CERN, if the accelerator
were to give us antiprotons
every second,

834
01:02:45,758 --> 01:02:47,379
and we could cool them
down that fast,

835
01:02:47,413 --> 01:02:52,103
we'd end up with something
of the order of a tenth
of a nanogram per year.

836
01:02:52,137 --> 01:02:56,517
Which means, that in order
to get one gram of antimatter
you need 10 billion years,

837
01:02:56,551 --> 01:02:58,896
which just happens to be
the age of the universe.

838
01:02:58,931 --> 01:03:02,551
So if you'd started collecting
antiprotons at the beginning
of the universe,

839
01:03:02,586 --> 01:03:03,862
at the moment of the big bang,

840
01:03:03,896 --> 01:03:05,793
we'd now have 1 gram
of antimatter.

841
01:03:08,448 --> 01:03:12,724
Even if this lengthy
production process
were practical,

842
01:03:12,758 --> 01:03:19,310
could we ever generate
enough fuel to get us
to the next solar system?

843
01:03:19,344 --> 01:03:24,586
Now, to get to Alpha Centauri,
my reference is Star Trek,
which has the Enterprise.

844
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:28,206
And in the Enterprise
there's this huge warp core
running with antimatter.

845
01:03:28,241 --> 01:03:30,655
That's a couple of tons'
worth of antimatter,

846
01:03:30,689 --> 01:03:34,896
but we can be a bit more
economical than that,
and call it a few kilograms.

847
01:03:34,931 --> 01:03:38,344
Which means that,
not only do you need
10 billion years,

848
01:03:38,379 --> 01:03:42,344
you actually need something
like a factor of 1,000
or 10,000 more than that,

849
01:03:42,379 --> 01:03:46,379
which is probably longer
than the age of the universe
into the future.

850
01:03:46,413 --> 01:03:49,931
And that's the amount of time
you need, under current
technological conditions

851
01:03:49,965 --> 01:03:52,517
to make enough antimatter
to get to Alpha Centauri.

852
01:03:52,551 --> 01:03:54,620
You'd be faster off
walking to get there.

853
01:04:15,655 --> 01:04:19,000
For now,
interstellar space travel

854
01:04:19,034 --> 01:04:21,862
remains in the realm
of science fiction.

855
01:04:28,034 --> 01:04:32,000
Unless, of course,
we get help from
outer space.

856
01:04:34,827 --> 01:04:38,206
If there were
technically-advanced
aliens out there,

857
01:04:38,241 --> 01:04:41,275
we could just ask them
to let us hitch a ride.

858
01:04:56,241 --> 01:05:00,068
Those of us
hoping to get a lift
from a UFO

859
01:05:00,103 --> 01:05:07,448
should best direct
their request to this colony
of extraterrestrials on Earth.

860
01:05:07,482 --> 01:05:11,551
In the Valley of the Dawn,
in Brazil, live people who
believe they are

861
01:05:11,586 --> 01:05:16,517
the descendants
of an alien species
from the planet Capella.

862
01:06:04,965 --> 01:06:09,103
The knowledge about
the extraterrestrial
history of the valley

863
01:06:09,137 --> 01:06:12,241
goes back to this woman,
Tia Neiva.

864
01:06:15,275 --> 01:06:22,172
Born Neiva Zelaya,
Tia Neiva was a truck driver
and single mother of four.

865
01:06:22,206 --> 01:06:28,620
When she died in 1984,
her followers preserved
her house as she had left it.

866
01:06:31,758 --> 01:06:34,931
They even turned her bathroom
into a shrine.

867
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:43,448
Photographs show how from
the 1960s onwards,

868
01:06:43,482 --> 01:06:46,034
she started receiving
cosmic energy.

869
01:06:50,275 --> 01:06:53,758
The energy is sent down
from the alien mothership

870
01:06:53,793 --> 01:06:56,655
that hovers invisibly
above the valley.

871
01:07:23,551 --> 01:07:29,413
Tia Neiva's followers
are still harvesting
healing rays today

872
01:07:29,448 --> 01:07:32,413
transmitted down
by benevolent aliens.

873
01:07:34,517 --> 01:07:39,551
So could this energy
be used to whisk us away
to faraway planets?

874
01:08:24,103 --> 01:08:27,551
The aliens
of the valley
are stuck on Earth.

875
01:08:27,586 --> 01:08:33,275
In the course of millennia,
their bodies have adapted
to our environment,

876
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:36,103
so there's no way back
to their home planet.

877
01:08:43,379 --> 01:08:46,758
Watching them draw
energy from outer space,

878
01:08:46,793 --> 01:08:49,655
we were mystified
by the experience.

879
01:08:49,689 --> 01:08:55,068
Which seemed at times
as perplexing as gazing
at a faraway galaxy.

880
01:09:22,310 --> 01:09:25,620
We left the aliens
of the Valley of Dawn

881
01:09:25,655 --> 01:09:28,655
with a certainty
that they would not be able

882
01:09:28,689 --> 01:09:31,241
to whisk us away
in their spacecraft.

883
01:09:36,206 --> 01:09:38,586
Our journey has shown us

884
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:42,724
that we humans
should not behave
like interplanetary locusts

885
01:09:43,344 --> 01:09:45,689
grazing our planet empty

886
01:09:45,724 --> 01:09:47,965
and then moving onto the next.

887
01:09:50,655 --> 01:09:52,758
But should we be sad
about that?

888
01:10:01,965 --> 01:10:04,448
Since his journeys
to the stars,

889
01:10:04,482 --> 01:10:08,448
astronaut Mike Foale looks
at our planet differently.

890
01:10:11,206 --> 01:10:14,137
I've always loved astronomy.
I've always loved the galaxy.

891
01:10:14,172 --> 01:10:17,517
I've always loved the idea
of being on other planets
around other stars.

892
01:10:20,517 --> 01:10:24,000
But in the end
the thing that drove me
the most was looking at Earth.

893
01:10:34,586 --> 01:10:38,172
The Earth is always changing
and so the light changes,

894
01:10:38,206 --> 01:10:41,448
the seasons change,
the seasons
are always different.

895
01:10:41,482 --> 01:10:44,482
And it's so fascinating,
it's utterly absorbing.

896
01:10:47,827 --> 01:10:50,896
Coming over the southern tip
of South America,
and almost always,

897
01:10:50,931 --> 01:10:52,827
the lighting
is pretty low-angle.

898
01:10:52,862 --> 01:10:54,965
So it has a sort of
deep dark blue.

899
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:56,655
Almost a mysterious...

900
01:10:56,689 --> 01:10:58,344
It looks cold, it is cold.

901
01:10:59,103 --> 01:11:00,103
But then you notice...

902
01:11:00,793 --> 01:11:01,931
I could see waves.

903
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:05,000
And you go, "Waves?

904
01:11:05,034 --> 01:11:07,620
From this altitude?
No, no, that can't be right."

905
01:11:07,655 --> 01:11:12,655
Yes, you can see waves,
South Atlantic waves

906
01:11:12,689 --> 01:11:17,137
going all the way
around the planet
at that latitude.

907
01:11:17,172 --> 01:11:20,103
Because they're
so huge driven by
the winds down there,

908
01:11:20,137 --> 01:11:24,172
you can actually see
the combined froth of
all the breaking waves

909
01:11:24,206 --> 01:11:27,275
from space, from orbit,
from hundreds of miles away.

910
01:11:32,551 --> 01:11:36,172
I appreciate the Earth,
and the ecology of the Earth.

911
01:11:36,206 --> 01:11:40,896
And as something I need
to communicate as being
worthwhile looking after,

912
01:11:40,931 --> 01:11:42,586
far more after being in space.

913
01:11:54,068 --> 01:11:56,758
Back at
Mauna Kea, Hawaii,

914
01:11:56,793 --> 01:12:00,034
the telescopes are trained
into the skies

915
01:12:00,068 --> 01:12:04,931
searching for undiscovered
worlds that might one day
be colonized.

916
01:12:09,655 --> 01:12:14,931
Down on the plains,
native Hawaiians have
a very different idea

917
01:12:14,965 --> 01:12:18,379
of what humanity's place
in the cosmos should be.

918
01:12:28,137 --> 01:12:31,172
This is
a highly symbolic place.

919
01:12:31,206 --> 01:12:35,551
In this black wasteland
Nobel Prize-winning science

920
01:12:35,586 --> 01:12:37,931
collides with
indigenous knowledge.

921
01:12:43,793 --> 01:12:49,655
Hawaiian activist
Lanakila Mangauil
pays reverence to the volcano.

922
01:12:51,827 --> 01:12:55,172
For him, Mauna Kea
is a holy mountain

923
01:12:55,206 --> 01:12:57,413
not to be disturbed by humans.

924
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:07,827
Astronomer Lucianne Walkowicz
has come down from the peak

925
01:13:07,862 --> 01:13:11,000
to listen and learn about
the Hawaiians' beliefs.

926
01:13:13,275 --> 01:13:18,793
Lanakila has agreed
to show Lucianne
how Mauna Kea is honored.

927
01:13:47,344 --> 01:13:50,517
The Hawaiians have
their own cosmology

928
01:13:50,551 --> 01:13:53,931
expressed in these
traditional songs and dances.

929
01:13:55,241 --> 01:13:58,931
Every little step
and gesture has
a significance

930
01:13:58,965 --> 01:14:01,482
connected with
the sacred volcano.

931
01:14:03,137 --> 01:14:06,620
Here on the mountain,
too much human footprints,
or walking,

932
01:14:06,655 --> 01:14:08,448
or shifting of the land

933
01:14:08,482 --> 01:14:11,758
disrupts the natural cycles
of the hydrology.

934
01:14:11,793 --> 01:14:13,413
From the snow, the ice,

935
01:14:13,448 --> 01:14:15,517
and how it needs
to percolate and move.

936
01:14:15,551 --> 01:14:18,379
So we have to allow
the forces of nature
to do its thing.

937
01:14:18,413 --> 01:14:22,586
So that very simple hula,
where you see us dancers

938
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:24,689
retreating with
this very light tapping

939
01:14:24,724 --> 01:14:27,034
of their fingers
and light tapping
of their feet,

940
01:14:27,068 --> 01:14:31,965
and the backward motion
is to show we should be
exiting these places,

941
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,206
and leave as little
to no imprint at all.

942
01:14:35,241 --> 01:14:36,482
Not even our footprints.

943
01:14:42,517 --> 01:14:46,137
Lanakila sees humans
as a part of creation

944
01:14:46,172 --> 01:14:48,586
and we ignore this
at our peril.

945
01:14:53,517 --> 01:14:55,172
When you break away
from that thinking

946
01:14:55,206 --> 01:14:57,206
or if you think
yourself outside, or worse,

947
01:14:57,241 --> 01:14:59,034
you think yourself
superior to that,

948
01:15:00,586 --> 01:15:02,517
well, this is what you get.

949
01:15:02,551 --> 01:15:05,448
This is not
the indigenous ecosystem
of this land.

950
01:15:06,103 --> 01:15:08,655
This is after human impact.

951
01:15:08,689 --> 01:15:12,379
Has all the native forests
of this mountain be decimated.

952
01:15:21,137 --> 01:15:23,206
So what
do you think
when you hear people

953
01:15:23,241 --> 01:15:26,793
saying that, you know,
now that they have
used the Earth,

954
01:15:26,827 --> 01:15:28,827
they're going to go
to other planets?

955
01:15:28,862 --> 01:15:32,448
Say, planets around
other stars or Mars,
or wherever it happens to be?

956
01:15:33,103 --> 01:15:34,620
It's a scary thought for me

957
01:15:34,655 --> 01:15:37,379
to think of people
wanting to go
and their whole mission

958
01:15:37,413 --> 01:15:41,172
just to go and continue
the extraction process
on other planets.

959
01:15:42,034 --> 01:15:43,103
Absolutely not.

960
01:15:43,137 --> 01:15:46,827
You know, there's so much more
to learn right here.

961
01:15:46,862 --> 01:15:48,689
And so in many cases,
I think it's important

962
01:15:48,724 --> 01:15:51,137
that we need to protect
the rest of the universe
from us.

963
01:15:57,206 --> 01:16:02,551
Lucianne Walkowicz
has drawn conclusions
from this message.

964
01:16:06,068 --> 01:16:08,965
I think
the problem that I have
with colonization

965
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,758
as described
by Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos,

966
01:16:12,793 --> 01:16:16,379
is that it really
does describe colonization.

967
01:16:16,413 --> 01:16:18,551
The idea of going places

968
01:16:18,586 --> 01:16:20,586
and extracting and exploiting.

969
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:23,482
The same kind of colonization
projected into space

970
01:16:23,517 --> 01:16:26,517
that many people
have experienced
here on Earth.

971
01:16:26,551 --> 01:16:29,379
Now on Earth, we do face
existential threats.

972
01:16:29,413 --> 01:16:31,724
We do have things
like climate change

973
01:16:31,758 --> 01:16:35,413
that are creating
a less habitable world
than the one

974
01:16:35,448 --> 01:16:37,206
that has raised
our species thus far.

975
01:16:37,241 --> 01:16:40,379
And we can't afford
to treat our planet

976
01:16:40,413 --> 01:16:42,137
as though we can
just use it up,

977
01:16:42,172 --> 01:16:44,310
eat everything up,
and throw it away.

978
01:16:44,862 --> 01:16:45,896
We have one home.

979
01:16:52,551 --> 01:16:59,310
Looking at this world
I see such unbelievable,
soul-drenching,

980
01:16:59,344 --> 01:17:02,896
life-supporting richness
and lushness

981
01:17:02,931 --> 01:17:06,413
that exists on
no other planet
that we know of.

982
01:17:06,448 --> 01:17:09,862
And that even if
we were to find a planet
around another star

983
01:17:09,896 --> 01:17:13,172
that we think,
might potentially
be like this,

984
01:17:13,206 --> 01:17:14,586
we would have
no way of knowing,

985
01:17:14,620 --> 01:17:19,448
we have no way of
human beings reaching there
in our lifetimes.

986
01:17:19,482 --> 01:17:22,862
And yet here we are
surrounded by a paradise.

987
01:17:29,275 --> 01:17:32,758
I just feel so humbled by
the planet that we live on.

988
01:17:32,793 --> 01:17:36,793
Especially as someone
who thinks often
of other worlds.

989
01:17:36,827 --> 01:17:39,379
That I can swim in the ocean.

990
01:17:39,413 --> 01:17:42,103
That I can drink from streams.

991
01:17:42,137 --> 01:17:44,793
That I can sit out and feel
the sun on my face.

992
01:17:44,827 --> 01:17:47,482
And I know that it
doesn't just not harm me,

993
01:17:47,517 --> 01:17:50,413
it actually sustains
and nourishes me

994
01:17:50,448 --> 01:17:51,793
and everyone I know,

995
01:17:51,827 --> 01:17:55,689
and everyone
in all of humanity
that has ever lived.
