00:00:09,183 --> 00:00:10,488
In other news,

4
00:00:10,532 --> 00:00:12,142
authorities are
still investigating

5
00:00:12,186 --> 00:00:14,710
a suspicious fire at the
Abernathy State Mental hospital.

6
00:00:14,753 --> 00:00:16,364
Although one unidentified body

7
00:00:16,407 --> 00:00:18,279
has been recovered
from the ashes,

8
00:00:18,322 --> 00:00:20,107
several staff and
high-security patients

9
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,413
remain unaccounted for
and it is not clear

10
00:00:22,457 --> 00:00:25,068
if they all perished in the
fire or if some of the inmates

11
00:00:25,112 --> 00:00:27,331
may have escaped from
the burning building.

12
00:00:34,904 --> 00:00:36,036
Not bad, huh?

13
00:00:38,342 --> 00:00:40,301
It's going to be the
jewel of the neighborhood

14
00:00:40,344 --> 00:00:41,258
when we're done.

15
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:43,695
I still say it's kinda creepy.

16
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:44,653
Oh, come on.

17
00:00:44,696 --> 00:00:46,046
It's gonna be fun fixing it up.

18
00:00:46,089 --> 00:00:47,699
And it's even closer
to your school.

19
00:00:47,743 --> 00:00:50,050
I can sleep in an
extra five minutes.

20
00:00:50,093 --> 00:00:50,876
Whoo hoo.

21
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:52,748
You're welcome.

22
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:39,316
Hello?

23
00:02:21,837 --> 00:02:24,622
-Hi, I'm Frank.
-Hi, I'm Maggie.

24
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,015
I see you bought
the old place.

25
00:02:26,058 --> 00:02:27,277
Yes. It's a beauty.

26
00:02:29,801 --> 00:02:31,194
Gonna need a lot
of work though.

27
00:03:09,754 --> 00:03:12,540
Mom? Mom is that you?

28
00:03:18,981 --> 00:03:19,808
Hello?

29
00:03:22,332 --> 00:03:24,160
-Oh my.
-Geez.

30
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,683
No more coffee for you.

31
00:03:29,296 --> 00:03:30,862
You all right?

32
00:03:30,906 --> 00:03:33,735
Yeah, I'm just a
little light headed.

33
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:38,218
That was quite the
scare you gave me.

34
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,872
Why don't you sit
down for a second?

35
00:03:46,356 --> 00:03:47,836
Mom, I'm fine.

36
00:03:48,793 --> 00:03:51,187
I think I just
freaked myself out.

37
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,145
I heard noises.

38
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:54,321
It's an old house.

39
00:03:54,364 --> 00:03:55,887
They do that.

40
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:56,845
You'll get used to it.

41
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,935
I still don't get
why we had to move,

42
00:03:59,978 --> 00:04:02,590
especially to an old
house in the same town.

43
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:04,983
Sometimes it's good
to have a fresh start,

44
00:04:05,027 --> 00:04:06,028
make new memories.

45
00:04:07,943 --> 00:04:09,988
You say that like
the old ones are bad.

46
00:04:10,032 --> 00:04:11,686
Oh no, baby.

47
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:12,774
They're not bad.

48
00:04:12,817 --> 00:04:13,644
They're just...

49
00:04:14,515 --> 00:04:15,342
A lot.

50
00:04:17,953 --> 00:04:19,998
Looks like you've already
started on your room

51
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:25,047
and you are still holding
onto that old music box.

52
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,441
-Does it even play anymore?

53
00:04:27,484 --> 00:04:30,270
Not really, but I don't
want to get rid of it.

54
00:04:34,578 --> 00:04:36,014
Are you sure you're all right?

55
00:04:39,017 --> 00:04:39,931
Yep. Never better.

56
00:04:40,976 --> 00:04:42,107
Come on.

57
00:04:42,151 --> 00:04:44,414
Let's get all this
unpacking over with.

58
00:04:49,245 --> 00:04:51,552
Guess I'm moving out.

59
00:04:51,595 --> 00:04:52,770
Man.

60
00:05:35,465 --> 00:05:36,684
Ah.

61
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:47,912
Oh.

62
00:05:54,745 --> 00:05:57,313
My dear sweet Alex.

63
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,012
I'm watching over you.

64
00:06:09,064 --> 00:06:11,022
Please, don't scream.

65
00:06:13,285 --> 00:06:14,025
Don't worry.

66
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:15,766
I'm not gonna hurt you.

67
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,639
I could never hurt you.

68
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,771
My name is Albert.

69
00:06:21,859 --> 00:06:22,773
Albert Beck.

70
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,255
I'm a surg--

71
00:06:26,298 --> 00:06:28,910
I was a surgeon, one of
the best in the world.

72
00:06:30,085 --> 00:06:32,087
So, don't you worry.

73
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:36,091
I know how beautiful
life is, how precious.

74
00:06:43,185 --> 00:06:44,316
What are you doing here?

75
00:06:46,493 --> 00:06:48,059
I saw the place was empty

76
00:06:49,278 --> 00:06:51,672
and I didn't have
any place to stay.

77
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:57,329
The last hospital I
was at, I was cured,

78
00:06:57,373 --> 00:06:58,983
So I left.

79
00:06:59,027 --> 00:07:01,856
It was all just a
big misunderstanding.

80
00:07:04,989 --> 00:07:06,426
I just needed them...

81
00:07:09,124 --> 00:07:11,082
I needed them to love me.

82
00:07:18,002 --> 00:07:19,439
My poor Albert.

83
00:07:22,485 --> 00:07:23,747
So sweet.

84
00:07:25,532 --> 00:07:27,403
Who couldn't love you?

85
00:07:29,536 --> 00:07:30,667
I won't tell.

86
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,031
Morning sweetie.

87
00:08:30,074 --> 00:08:31,249
Morning.

88
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:34,644
I'm leaving in a minute of
you want a ride to school.

89
00:08:34,688 --> 00:08:36,298
Scott's picking me up.

90
00:08:36,341 --> 00:08:38,866
One of the perks of
moving closer, right?

91
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:39,649
Well, have a good day.

92
00:08:39,693 --> 00:08:41,259
Tell Scott I said hi.

93
00:08:41,303 --> 00:08:42,522
Bye mom.

94
00:08:51,922 --> 00:08:54,011
Morning, beautiful.

95
00:08:54,055 --> 00:08:55,186
Hey.

96
00:09:02,324 --> 00:09:03,543
You all right?

97
00:09:05,762 --> 00:09:08,112
Yeah, it's nothing.

98
00:09:08,156 --> 00:09:09,244
All right, come on.

99
00:09:24,476 --> 00:09:26,217
I'm so glad you called.

100
00:09:26,261 --> 00:09:29,264
This house is creepy as
hell and I'm all alone

101
00:09:29,307 --> 00:09:31,266
because Mom went to
some real estate thing.

102
00:09:32,397 --> 00:09:34,095
So, how's the unpacking going?

103
00:09:34,138 --> 00:09:35,400
Endless.

104
00:09:35,444 --> 00:09:36,837
You never realize how
much stuff you have

105
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,448
until you have to pack
and then unpack it.

106
00:09:39,491 --> 00:09:41,015
It mean it's a good thing
this house is so big.

107
00:09:41,058 --> 00:09:42,451
I need three rooms
just to hold--

108
00:09:45,672 --> 00:09:47,238
Hey, what's up?

109
00:09:49,153 --> 00:09:51,982
This house makes
the weirdest noises.

110
00:09:52,026 --> 00:09:53,505
It's haunted, it's
definitely haunted.

111
00:09:53,549 --> 00:09:55,377
Yeah, that's what I told my mom.

112
00:09:58,554 --> 00:10:00,077
Babe, are you okay?

113
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,037
I'm just gonna get some water.

114
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,647
I'll call you back in a few.

115
00:10:04,691 --> 00:10:07,302
-Okay babe, love you.

116
00:10:40,335 --> 00:10:41,858
Oh no.

117
00:10:41,902 --> 00:10:42,685
Oh no.

118
00:10:47,342 --> 00:10:48,125
Okay.

119
00:10:49,561 --> 00:10:50,475
Pulse is weak.

120
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:55,263
Irregular heartbeat.

121
00:11:03,401 --> 00:11:04,533
911, what
is your emergency?

122
00:11:04,576 --> 00:11:07,667
I need an ambulance,
721 Charaday Lane.

123
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:10,365
I have an 18 year old
female she's having cardiac--

124
00:11:11,453 --> 00:11:12,497
I have a girl who's passed out.

125
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:13,411
I don't know what's
wrong though.

126
00:11:13,455 --> 00:11:15,283
Please send somebody.

127
00:11:15,326 --> 00:11:16,414
Ambulance is on the way.

128
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,415
What is your name, sir?

129
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,505
Nope.

130
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,509
Okay.

131
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:28,688
Hang in there, beautiful.

132
00:11:28,731 --> 00:11:29,645
Help's on the way.

133
00:11:43,311 --> 00:11:46,444
Paging Dr.
Stavan, Dr. Stavan please.

134
00:11:55,453 --> 00:11:57,499
All nurses
to the nursing station.

135
00:12:09,685 --> 00:12:11,469
Paging
Dr. Bender,

136
00:12:11,513 --> 00:12:13,384
paging Dr.
Bender, please.

137
00:12:23,307 --> 00:12:24,047
Mrs. Newell?

138
00:12:24,091 --> 00:12:25,483
Yes, Doctor.

139
00:12:25,527 --> 00:12:27,311
Your daughter is
doing just fine.

140
00:12:27,355 --> 00:12:29,096
The surgery went very well.

141
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:30,532
We installed a pacemaker,

142
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:32,621
but that's just a temporary
fix for her condition.

143
00:12:34,188 --> 00:12:35,798
Her condition?

144
00:12:35,842 --> 00:12:37,887
Alex is suffering from the
same cardiac degeneration

145
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:38,845
as her father had.

146
00:12:40,411 --> 00:12:43,153
I'm afraid that she's gonna
need a heart transplant

147
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:47,114
And I can't stress enough
that time is of the essence.

148
00:12:47,157 --> 00:12:49,594
Within six months, maybe sooner.

149
00:12:49,638 --> 00:12:52,380
Alex also has one of
the rarest blood types.

150
00:12:52,423 --> 00:12:56,123
Finding a suitable donor is
gonna be extremely challenging.

151
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:01,345
Oh God, I can't...

152
00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:03,173
I can't lose my baby girl.

153
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:06,568
We're gonna do everything
we can to help her.

154
00:13:07,743 --> 00:13:09,136
Come on, let's see
if she's awake.

155
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:10,006
Okay.

156
00:13:14,576 --> 00:13:16,230
Wow.

157
00:13:16,273 --> 00:13:18,232
Dr. Bender
to the mental ward please.

158
00:13:18,275 --> 00:13:19,842
Dr. Bender.

159
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,551
Paging Dr. Bender,
Paging Dr. Bender.

160
00:13:41,995 --> 00:13:44,911
You're very lucky the paramedics
got there when they did.

161
00:13:44,954 --> 00:13:47,130
There could have been
some serious damage.

162
00:13:48,349 --> 00:13:50,394
I guess I have you
to thank for that.

163
00:13:50,438 --> 00:13:51,656
I didn't call.

164
00:13:53,223 --> 00:13:55,660
I don't understand. If you
didn't call, then who did?

165
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:58,185
Maybe a good Samaritan walking
by, heard your cry for help.

166
00:13:58,228 --> 00:14:00,361
I don't remember doing that,

167
00:14:00,404 --> 00:14:03,233
but it's still
kinda fuzzy, so I--

168
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:06,410
If it were me I'd count my
blessings and pay it forward.

169
00:14:06,454 --> 00:14:08,325
Now Alex's pacemaker is wireless

170
00:14:08,369 --> 00:14:10,197
so we can keep track
of any abnormalities

171
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,763
in case they occur.

172
00:14:11,807 --> 00:14:14,288
However, that means
bedrest, minor activity.

173
00:14:14,331 --> 00:14:16,856
We don't want to
worsen your condition.

174
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:19,206
I added Alex's name to
the transplant list.

175
00:14:19,249 --> 00:14:21,469
So I'll keep you
involved as it develops.

176
00:14:22,644 --> 00:14:23,906
In the meantime,
I recommend hiring

177
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,387
an at-home nurse to keep
an eye on her, help out.

178
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:30,043
We can't count on the good
Samaritan being there again.

179
00:14:30,086 --> 00:14:32,480
Okay. I'll have the
nurses leave a referral.

180
00:14:32,523 --> 00:14:33,873
-Thank you.
-In the meantime,

181
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,439
she should get some rest.

182
00:14:35,483 --> 00:14:37,137
You had quite a day.

183
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,442
I'll check in on you later.

184
00:14:41,228 --> 00:14:42,664
Are you okay, baby?

185
00:14:42,707 --> 00:14:44,535
Do you need anything?

186
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:46,886
Mom, nothing's gonna happen.

187
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:49,584
I'm exhausted.

188
00:14:51,499 --> 00:14:54,154
Try and get some sleep then.

189
00:14:56,286 --> 00:14:57,374
I love you, baby.

190
00:14:57,418 --> 00:14:58,288
I'll bring your
homework by tomorrow.

191
00:15:00,856 --> 00:15:03,032
Bye baby. Love you.

192
00:15:03,076 --> 00:15:03,903
See ya.

193
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:14,217
It's okay, she's
gonna be all right.

194
00:15:14,261 --> 00:15:15,697
An at-home nurse.

195
00:15:41,853 --> 00:15:44,465
Paging Dr.
Stavan, Dr. Stavan please.

196
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:06,791
It's clear now this
was meant to be.

197
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:19,369
Me choosing your
home, meeting you,

198
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:25,201
And you needing a new heart.

199
00:16:26,768 --> 00:16:29,336
I'll get you that heart, Alex.

200
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:31,425
I'll even do the
surgery myself...

201
00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:36,647
...to prove how much I love you.

202
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,358
Sleep well, beautiful.

203
00:16:52,576 --> 00:16:56,841
Dr. Beck will take
care of everything.

204
00:17:15,164 --> 00:17:16,861
Chris McCoy.

205
00:17:58,773 --> 00:18:00,296
-Oh, uh...

206
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,471
No.

207
00:18:01,515 --> 00:18:03,604
What are you
doing in my house?

208
00:18:04,692 --> 00:18:06,607
Is your name Chris?

209
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:07,782
Who the hell are you?

210
00:18:07,825 --> 00:18:09,653
I'm from Midhaven General.

211
00:18:09,697 --> 00:18:11,133
I'm here to notify you

212
00:18:11,177 --> 00:18:13,701
there's been a misunderstanding
regarding your referral.

213
00:18:13,744 --> 00:18:15,485
The family won't be
needing your services

214
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:18,140
so I'm here to take your place.

215
00:18:30,544 --> 00:18:31,632
Ow.

216
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:36,289
Man on man.

217
00:18:41,294 --> 00:18:43,426
You did that to yourself.

218
00:18:46,951 --> 00:18:47,778
Oh.

219
00:18:52,043 --> 00:18:52,870
Hi.

220
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:56,265
I didn't know anyone
else was here.

221
00:18:59,703 --> 00:19:01,096
I'm a friend of Chris'.

222
00:19:02,706 --> 00:19:04,186
You know, she had an accident.

223
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,666
She tripped, she fell.

224
00:19:09,017 --> 00:19:12,499
You
scared me, you dummy.

225
00:19:26,817 --> 00:19:28,515
Hello, this is Chris McCoy.

226
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:29,559
This is Maggie Newell.

227
00:19:29,603 --> 00:19:31,213
Hello, Mrs. Newell.

228
00:19:31,257 --> 00:19:32,519
-Hi.
-Yeah, the hospital

229
00:19:32,562 --> 00:19:33,998
said you might be calling.

230
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:35,130
Are you available?

231
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,523
-Yes ma'am.
-Tomorrow?

232
00:19:36,566 --> 00:19:38,089
-Available.
-Noon?

233
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:38,960
Yes ma'am.

234
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,447
Wow.

235
00:19:49,144 --> 00:19:50,841
It's what the
hospital recommended.

236
00:19:50,885 --> 00:19:52,930
Just to make sure you're okay.

237
00:19:52,974 --> 00:19:54,584
Lucky me.

238
00:19:54,628 --> 00:19:59,502
You know, I've always
wanted...whatever that is.

239
00:20:00,982 --> 00:20:02,549
That must be the nurse.

240
00:20:02,592 --> 00:20:04,159
You mean my babysitter?

241
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,552
Alex, play nice.

242
00:20:05,595 --> 00:20:07,249
-Okay.
-I'll be right back.

243
00:20:07,293 --> 00:20:08,032
Why don't you sit down?

244
00:20:08,076 --> 00:20:09,382
I'm fine.

245
00:20:09,425 --> 00:20:10,513
Really, go.

246
00:20:23,004 --> 00:20:26,094
Maggie. I'm nurse McCoy.

247
00:20:26,137 --> 00:20:27,965
But you can call me Chris.

248
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,838
Oh, hi.

249
00:20:30,881 --> 00:20:35,016
Sorry. I just, well
I wasn't expecting--

250
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:37,627
That's all right, I've
heard it all before.

251
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:39,760
But experience only
comes with time, right?

252
00:20:40,674 --> 00:20:42,153
That's true.

253
00:20:42,197 --> 00:20:43,677
Please, come in.

254
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,765
I'd love to.

255
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,860
What a lovely home.

256
00:20:52,903 --> 00:20:54,775
Oh, thank you.

257
00:20:54,818 --> 00:20:56,690
Still have a lot of work to do.

258
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:58,126
You're renovating.

259
00:20:58,169 --> 00:21:01,434
Yeah. I adore these old
Victorians, kinda my thing.

260
00:21:01,477 --> 00:21:03,174
Saving places like this.

261
00:21:03,218 --> 00:21:04,785
You ever heard of St Agatha's?

262
00:21:04,828 --> 00:21:06,090
No.

263
00:21:06,134 --> 00:21:07,788
It's an old hospital on
the outskirts of town.

264
00:21:07,831 --> 00:21:09,050
Been abandoned for years.

265
00:21:09,093 --> 00:21:10,704
Our company just purchased it

266
00:21:10,747 --> 00:21:12,575
and I'm renovating that too.

267
00:21:12,619 --> 00:21:14,577
Turning it into a
recreation center.

268
00:21:14,621 --> 00:21:16,275
Nice.

269
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:17,667
Let me introduce you to Alex.

270
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:18,755
Mmhmm.

271
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:33,683
Alex, this is Nurse McCoy.

272
00:21:33,727 --> 00:21:35,163
Please, call me Chris.

273
00:21:37,818 --> 00:21:39,646
Okay, Nurse Chris.

274
00:21:40,864 --> 00:21:43,606
So the hospital said
you had quite the scare.

275
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:46,435
Yeah, but they
patched me back up.

276
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:49,177
I actually feel
pretty good right now.

277
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,700
I know what you're thinking,

278
00:21:50,744 --> 00:21:51,962
that a beautiful young
woman like yourself

279
00:21:52,006 --> 00:21:53,399
does not need a babysitter.

280
00:21:53,442 --> 00:21:56,271
So, think of me as your
personal physician,

281
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,882
as if you're a big time
celebrity and I'm on your staff.

282
00:22:00,144 --> 00:22:00,928
Okay, Doc.

283
00:22:02,886 --> 00:22:05,541
I'll need my hand
back eventually.

284
00:22:05,585 --> 00:22:06,716
Just checking your pulse.

285
00:22:09,502 --> 00:22:10,938
All good.

286
00:22:10,981 --> 00:22:13,767
You're so lucky your mom
found you when you collapsed.

287
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:15,203
Oh, actually I didn't.

288
00:22:15,246 --> 00:22:18,380
Apparently I have a mystery
stalker who called 911.

289
00:22:18,424 --> 00:22:19,642
Stalker?

290
00:22:19,686 --> 00:22:20,774
Sounds more like you have

291
00:22:20,817 --> 00:22:22,689
a guardian angel
watching over you.

292
00:22:26,127 --> 00:22:27,258
Maybe it was Dad.

293
00:22:29,739 --> 00:22:31,393
Well, I should go.

294
00:22:31,437 --> 00:22:33,439
-But--
-I promise you,

295
00:22:33,482 --> 00:22:35,876
she is in excellent hands.

296
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,704
Okay. I'll be back.

297
00:22:37,747 --> 00:22:39,096
Call me if you need anything.

298
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,577
-Okay, love you.
-Love you.

299
00:22:43,753 --> 00:22:44,841
Please.

300
00:22:49,498 --> 00:22:50,934
So this must be sentimental.

301
00:22:51,805 --> 00:22:54,677
Let me guess, first boyfriend.

302
00:22:56,549 --> 00:23:00,074
No, my dad actually.

303
00:23:01,902 --> 00:23:03,338
It reminds me of him.

304
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:08,256
Oh, I can't think of a better
reason to hang on to it.

305
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:09,649
Just because something's broken

306
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,608
does not mean it
should be discarded.

307
00:23:15,872 --> 00:23:18,484
Let's check out your equipment
and set up your app, huh?

308
00:23:18,527 --> 00:23:19,398
Okay.

309
00:23:23,053 --> 00:23:23,924
Hey there.

310
00:23:43,378 --> 00:23:44,727
Morning, neighbor.

311
00:23:44,771 --> 00:23:46,294
How's it going?

312
00:23:46,337 --> 00:23:48,035
Hi. Frank, right?

313
00:23:48,078 --> 00:23:50,951
I couldn't help, but notice
your security camera.

314
00:23:50,994 --> 00:23:54,563
Yeah, we had some trouble
with mail theft a while back.

315
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:57,566
It's motion activated.

316
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:00,526
Really? How long
does it store footage?

317
00:24:02,005 --> 00:24:04,834
This app gives me live
updates on your pacemaker.

318
00:24:04,878 --> 00:24:08,751
That way I'll be alerted if
ever anything goes wrong.

319
00:24:08,795 --> 00:24:11,014
Also, it has GPS.

320
00:24:11,058 --> 00:24:13,843
So it keeps track of
you if you sleep walk.

321
00:24:13,887 --> 00:24:15,323
You don't sleep walk, do ya?

322
00:24:15,366 --> 00:24:17,543
No.

323
00:24:17,586 --> 00:24:20,415
So, I'm basically a human GPS.

324
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,722
Just to keep you safe.

325
00:24:23,897 --> 00:24:27,161
All right, I'm need to
check your incision,

326
00:24:27,204 --> 00:24:28,989
make sure everything looks good.

327
00:24:32,035 --> 00:24:34,168
Tell me if anything hurts.

328
00:24:38,607 --> 00:24:39,913
It's just sore.

329
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:43,046
Completely normal.

330
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:44,221
Means you're healing.

331
00:24:47,703 --> 00:24:48,530
Look at me.

332
00:24:49,923 --> 00:24:50,924
I'm such a freak.

333
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:52,926
Hardly.

334
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:56,799
The scar will fade.

335
00:24:58,235 --> 00:24:59,062
Okay. All done.

336
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,108
Okay.

337
00:25:05,025 --> 00:25:06,940
How about some tea?

338
00:25:06,983 --> 00:25:09,508
I make a mean chamomile.

339
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:11,422
Sure. That sounds good.

340
00:25:11,466 --> 00:25:12,598
'Kay.

341
00:25:12,641 --> 00:25:15,252
Oh, those are lovely.

342
00:25:15,296 --> 00:25:18,821
Yeah. They were in my
hospital room with no card.

343
00:25:18,865 --> 00:25:20,040
I guess my boyfriend sent them

344
00:25:22,738 --> 00:25:25,959
Well, whoever sent them, they
think you're very special.

345
00:25:31,617 --> 00:25:33,183
It doesn't make sense.

346
00:25:33,227 --> 00:25:36,578
There must have been a late
night jogger or a dog Walker.

347
00:25:36,622 --> 00:25:37,927
You saw it.

348
00:25:37,971 --> 00:25:38,885
There was no one.

349
00:25:40,016 --> 00:25:41,670
So who called 911?

350
00:25:41,714 --> 00:25:43,411
Maybe someone heard
it from the backyard.

351
00:25:43,454 --> 00:25:45,239
Why would someone
be in my backyard?

352
00:25:45,282 --> 00:25:46,849
And at that time of night?

353
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:54,074
We'll spend the day
together, have some lunch.

354
00:25:54,117 --> 00:25:55,641
Maybe go for a walk.

355
00:25:57,033 --> 00:25:58,078
Hi?

356
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,908
I'm Scott, Alex's boyfriend.

357
00:26:03,344 --> 00:26:04,867
You must be the nurse.

358
00:26:04,911 --> 00:26:10,220
Yeah, hi, I'm Chris McCoy.

359
00:26:10,264 --> 00:26:11,744
Shouldn't you be in school?

360
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:13,006
Yeah, they gave me early release

361
00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:14,485
so I can bring
Alex her homework.

362
00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:17,010
Oh, well, Alex is resting.

363
00:26:17,053 --> 00:26:19,012
It's not a good
time for a visitor.

364
00:26:20,274 --> 00:26:23,930
Well, we've been texting all
day, so she knows I'm coming.

365
00:26:25,235 --> 00:26:26,454
Okay then.

366
00:26:28,108 --> 00:26:29,936
I was just taking
her tea and biscuits.

367
00:26:29,979 --> 00:26:31,502
Yeah, cool. Let's do it.

368
00:26:35,376 --> 00:26:37,117
Son of a--

369
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,075
Hey, I thought I
heard your voice.

370
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:40,468
What's up? How you feeling?

371
00:26:41,382 --> 00:26:42,557
-Hi.
-I missed you.

372
00:26:43,863 --> 00:26:44,951
Here's your tea.

373
00:26:44,994 --> 00:26:46,909
-Thank you.
-Mmhmm.

374
00:26:46,953 --> 00:26:48,911
And thank you for the flowers.

375
00:26:48,955 --> 00:26:49,999
They're beautiful.

376
00:26:50,043 --> 00:26:51,087
Flowers?

377
00:26:53,307 --> 00:26:54,569
-Yeah.
-They were from you, right?

378
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:55,788
Yeah, of course.

379
00:26:55,831 --> 00:26:56,919
No, they should've
left the card.

380
00:26:56,963 --> 00:26:58,225
There's, there wasn't a card?

381
00:26:58,268 --> 00:26:59,922
Nuh uh.

382
00:26:59,966 --> 00:27:01,968
Huh, so lame.

383
00:27:02,011 --> 00:27:04,231
Well, they really made my day.

384
00:27:04,274 --> 00:27:05,667
I'm glad.

385
00:27:05,711 --> 00:27:07,669
-You're the best.
-I love you.

386
00:27:08,496 --> 00:27:09,236
I love you too.

387
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,064
You liar!

388
00:27:11,107 --> 00:27:12,065
Liar, liar, liar.

389
00:27:12,108 --> 00:27:14,197
I brought her the flowers.

390
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:21,378
I got those flowers for her.

391
00:27:22,553 --> 00:27:23,903
I left 'em for you.

392
00:27:23,946 --> 00:27:24,773
It was me.

393
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,088
-It's so hard.
-It's not hard.

394
00:27:36,611 --> 00:27:39,570
All right, so Mr. Sanders
gave us so much homework.

395
00:27:39,614 --> 00:27:42,008
Oh my gosh, I swear he
likes to torture us.

396
00:27:42,051 --> 00:27:44,097
-Yeah, definitely.
-Alex.

397
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,838
You need to rest.

398
00:27:46,752 --> 00:27:49,842
I know, but I'm so bored.

399
00:27:49,885 --> 00:27:53,410
Just like an hour, please?

400
00:27:53,454 --> 00:27:55,369
Okay. One hour.

401
00:27:55,412 --> 00:27:57,327
-Thank you.
-Trust me, bro.

402
00:27:57,371 --> 00:27:59,547
I can get her
anything she needs.

403
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:03,551
All right, so we have
an entire chapter due.

404
00:28:03,594 --> 00:28:05,335
I'll go downstairs, then?

405
00:28:06,772 --> 00:28:07,686
Yeah, please do.

406
00:28:08,948 --> 00:28:10,079
What the heck
is a logarithm anyway?

407
00:28:10,123 --> 00:28:12,081
-Oh beats me.

408
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:14,127
I never understood
this stuff anyway.

409
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:16,956
Okay, so we have an entire
chapter due by Tuesday.

410
00:28:18,131 --> 00:28:19,523
I think we're both
in trouble here.

411
00:28:24,485 --> 00:28:25,312
Oh man.

412
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:05,107
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

413
00:30:06,979 --> 00:30:09,068
This will do perfectly.

414
00:30:10,243 --> 00:30:11,548
Dr.
Beck to the ER.

415
00:30:11,592 --> 00:30:14,116
Dr. Beck, you're
needed in the ER.

416
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:17,119
Dr. Beck to the ER, urgent.

417
00:30:18,338 --> 00:30:21,645
Dr. Beck to the ER,
Dr. Beck to the ER.

418
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:25,127
Dr. Beck, you're
needed in the ER.

419
00:30:32,004 --> 00:30:33,179
Hi, Dr. Beck.

420
00:30:33,222 --> 00:30:34,745
Hello, darling.

421
00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:37,357
You're still the greatest
heart doctor in the world.

422
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,227
I know.

423
00:30:43,232 --> 00:30:44,886
There you are.

424
00:30:45,931 --> 00:30:48,020
Got outta your room again I see.

425
00:30:49,108 --> 00:30:49,891
No.

426
00:30:51,414 --> 00:30:55,027
I would love to talk to you,
but I'm needed in surgery.

427
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:55,636
Stop!

428
00:30:58,378 --> 00:31:00,859
Time for your electrotherapy.

429
00:31:00,902 --> 00:31:03,165
Electrotherapy.

430
00:31:03,209 --> 00:31:04,558
I'm cured.

431
00:31:04,601 --> 00:31:06,168
I don't see fake people anymore.

432
00:31:06,212 --> 00:31:08,475
Like that guy,
especially that guy

433
00:31:08,518 --> 00:31:10,781
in the hat and Hawaiian shirt.

434
00:31:10,825 --> 00:31:11,695
I never see him.

435
00:31:11,739 --> 00:31:14,873
Oh, but you do, Dr. Beck.

436
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:17,136
You see fake people
all the time.

437
00:31:18,137 --> 00:31:19,225
No, no, no, no.

438
00:31:19,268 --> 00:31:21,096
What do you think I am?

439
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,709
A fake person?

440
00:31:28,582 --> 00:31:30,062
Yeah.

441
00:31:43,945 --> 00:31:45,207
You are so funny.

442
00:31:46,643 --> 00:31:49,342
Get the hell outta my hospital!

443
00:31:56,479 --> 00:31:57,263
Oh man.

444
00:32:03,965 --> 00:32:05,140
AB negative.

445
00:32:05,184 --> 00:32:06,185
Hello.

446
00:32:07,055 --> 00:32:09,797
Benedict, John H, 52.

447
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,320
Heart disease? Pass.

448
00:32:12,713 --> 00:32:17,022
Daniels, Mary age 46
diabetes and chronic smoker.

449
00:32:17,065 --> 00:32:18,371
You're supposed
to treat your body

450
00:32:18,414 --> 00:32:20,851
like a temple, not
a temple of doom.

451
00:32:20,895 --> 00:32:22,984
We only want the best.

452
00:32:24,072 --> 00:32:28,033
Here we go, Carlisle,
Patrick, age 42,

453
00:32:28,076 --> 00:32:30,992
no family history of disease.

454
00:32:31,036 --> 00:32:31,950
Put him in the folder.

455
00:32:33,081 --> 00:32:38,173
And moving on,
Matthews, Gail, age 35,

456
00:32:38,217 --> 00:32:41,481
non smoker, no
underlying disease.

457
00:32:41,524 --> 00:32:44,005
She might be just what
the doctor ordered.

458
00:32:44,049 --> 00:32:45,746
So to speak.

459
00:32:45,789 --> 00:32:46,747
Let's look her up.

460
00:32:47,748 --> 00:32:50,011
She got a dating profile.

461
00:32:50,055 --> 00:32:51,273
Hey, kinda sexy.

462
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,974
Don't be jealous.

463
00:32:56,017 --> 00:32:57,410
You have nothing to worry about.

464
00:32:57,453 --> 00:32:59,716
A woman her age'd
never work out for me.

465
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,500
She's active.

466
00:33:00,543 --> 00:33:01,501
I like that.

467
00:33:03,111 --> 00:33:06,027
She keeps herself in
shape, that's for sure.

468
00:33:06,071 --> 00:33:07,855
In to beer.

469
00:33:07,898 --> 00:33:09,988
Good thing you don't
need her liver.

470
00:33:10,031 --> 00:33:12,729
All in all, I think we
might have a winner.

471
00:33:12,773 --> 00:33:14,035
Let's say hello.

472
00:33:16,516 --> 00:33:19,693
Saw your profile, would
love to meet you in person.

473
00:33:19,736 --> 00:33:21,956
Hoping I can steal...

474
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,219
...your heart.

475
00:33:25,873 --> 00:33:26,656
Too much?

476
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:31,748
Maybe Albert Beck
hasn't lost his charm.

477
00:33:41,236 --> 00:33:43,543
Oh, I didn't realize
you were here.

478
00:33:43,586 --> 00:33:44,631
Sorry to scare ya.

479
00:33:44,674 --> 00:33:46,111
It's okay. I'm running late.

480
00:33:46,154 --> 00:33:47,068
I'll see you later.

481
00:33:47,112 --> 00:33:47,982
Alex will be down in a minute.

482
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:48,939
She's just having a shower.

483
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,154
Wow.

484
00:35:31,259 --> 00:35:32,434
Thank you.

485
00:35:32,478 --> 00:35:34,175
You really don't have
to do all of this.

486
00:35:34,219 --> 00:35:36,177
Don't be silly.

487
00:35:36,221 --> 00:35:40,050
The fastest way to heal is
to keep your strength up.

488
00:35:43,228 --> 00:35:45,273
Looks like someone's
got a secret admirer.

489
00:35:47,188 --> 00:35:48,233
No, no.

490
00:35:48,276 --> 00:35:49,059
I just enjoy--

491
00:35:49,103 --> 00:35:50,670
Your phone.

492
00:35:50,713 --> 00:35:52,846
Looks like you've got plans
with a special someone tonight.

493
00:35:52,889 --> 00:35:53,803
Oh, that.

494
00:35:56,023 --> 00:35:57,503
"Looking forward to
meeting you tonight."

495
00:35:57,546 --> 00:36:00,897
Followed by lots of heart
emojis and a few others.

496
00:36:00,941 --> 00:36:02,595
It's nothing. Just a first date.

497
00:36:03,726 --> 00:36:06,555
So, any news on your
good Samaritan?

498
00:36:08,122 --> 00:36:09,645
No.

499
00:36:09,689 --> 00:36:12,431
Now my mom's thinking someone
saw me from the backyard.

500
00:36:12,474 --> 00:36:14,172
Why would anyone be back here?

501
00:36:14,215 --> 00:36:15,999
Well maybe they
saw you from there

502
00:36:16,043 --> 00:36:17,653
and they didn't want to
seem like a peeping Tom.

503
00:36:17,697 --> 00:36:19,742
So why leave their name?

504
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,223
Maybe.

505
00:36:23,964 --> 00:36:26,836
I just wish I knew who it
was so I could thank them.

506
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,099
Yeah. What would you say?

507
00:36:30,057 --> 00:36:33,626
-I'd thank them for noticing me.
-Mmhmm.

508
00:36:33,669 --> 00:36:35,367
You know they had
no idea who I was

509
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:37,586
and they still cared
enough to help me.

510
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,241
That's unconditional.

511
00:36:42,243 --> 00:36:44,245
Like it was with my dad.

512
00:36:44,289 --> 00:36:46,160
Like your dad.

513
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,509
Wow.

514
00:36:47,553 --> 00:36:48,815
What else?

515
00:36:48,858 --> 00:36:50,904
I'd tell them that
they have no reason

516
00:36:50,947 --> 00:36:54,081
to be afraid to come forward
and reveal who they are.

517
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:58,390
You know, maybe...maybe they
did something in the past

518
00:36:58,433 --> 00:37:00,609
but it doesn't matter

519
00:37:00,653 --> 00:37:02,698
'cause they still have
a really good heart.

520
00:37:02,742 --> 00:37:04,047
They proved that by caring

521
00:37:04,091 --> 00:37:05,223
about someone they
didn't even know.

522
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:06,311
Right.

523
00:37:09,314 --> 00:37:12,447
Alex, I um--

524
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,058
What?

525
00:37:19,106 --> 00:37:20,412
Oh, it's Scott.

526
00:37:21,761 --> 00:37:23,197
Hey.

527
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,721
Yeah I know, I want to go.

528
00:37:25,765 --> 00:37:26,809
Of course it is.

529
00:37:35,601 --> 00:37:37,385
-Whoo.
-Whoo is right.

530
00:37:38,995 --> 00:37:42,260
So tell me about you, Chris.

531
00:37:42,303 --> 00:37:45,175
Oh, not much to tell.

532
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,961
I'm in the medical profession.

533
00:37:48,004 --> 00:37:49,789
A doctor!

534
00:37:49,832 --> 00:37:52,313
Well a nurse, actually.

535
00:37:52,357 --> 00:37:54,315
A male nurse.

536
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:56,317
You don't see too many of those.

537
00:37:56,361 --> 00:37:58,363
Oh, we're more common
than you think.

538
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,495
So, tell me about you.

539
00:38:01,801 --> 00:38:04,325
Divorced, kids?

540
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:05,761
Never married.

541
00:38:05,805 --> 00:38:09,374
So, no in the kids
department, that I know of.

542
00:38:11,898 --> 00:38:13,116
My family's on the other coast.

543
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,032
So it's just me
doing my own thing.

544
00:38:16,076 --> 00:38:17,643
No baggage.

545
00:38:17,686 --> 00:38:20,341
That is so refreshing to hear.

546
00:38:20,385 --> 00:38:21,211
I'm the same.

547
00:38:22,387 --> 00:38:25,651
Look Chris, you seem
like the type of guy

548
00:38:25,694 --> 00:38:28,001
who goes after what he wants.

549
00:38:28,044 --> 00:38:29,307
Oh I am.

550
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:31,047
I'm the same way.

551
00:38:31,091 --> 00:38:32,222
I'm not one for wasting time.

552
00:38:32,266 --> 00:38:35,269
When I want something,
I go get it.

553
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,053
That scares a lot of guys off.

554
00:38:37,097 --> 00:38:38,925
Probably the reason
I'm still single.

555
00:38:44,017 --> 00:38:44,844
Probably.

556
00:38:45,714 --> 00:38:48,021
So, what do you say

557
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:50,545
we cut through all
this pre-foreplay crap

558
00:38:50,589 --> 00:38:52,417
and get to the good stuff?

559
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,332
Your place or mine?

560
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:57,247
Definitely mine.

561
00:39:03,906 --> 00:39:04,733
You okay?

562
00:39:05,821 --> 00:39:07,301
Mom, I'm fine.

563
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:11,349
Goodnight, baby.

564
00:39:11,392 --> 00:39:13,612
If you need anything,
just give a shout.

565
00:39:13,655 --> 00:39:14,787
Okay, I love you.

566
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:15,657
I love you.

567
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,476
Cute place.

568
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:52,955
Thank you.

569
00:39:52,999 --> 00:39:54,304
A little bit more feminine

570
00:39:54,348 --> 00:39:56,263
than I expected
from a single guy.

571
00:39:57,482 --> 00:39:59,266
Well, I am gonna redecorate.

572
00:39:59,309 --> 00:40:00,441
I just haven't had
time what with work.

573
00:40:00,485 --> 00:40:02,443
What's in here?

574
00:40:02,487 --> 00:40:05,141
Oh, hold on a sec.

575
00:40:05,185 --> 00:40:06,404
Oh, uh...

576
00:40:07,666 --> 00:40:08,536
Uh huh.

577
00:40:09,668 --> 00:40:11,713
That's just for work.

578
00:40:11,757 --> 00:40:12,584
Kinky.

579
00:40:13,759 --> 00:40:15,238
Is she gonna join us?

580
00:40:18,285 --> 00:40:20,983
Why don't I make us
a couple of drinks?

581
00:40:21,027 --> 00:40:22,158
You read my mind.

582
00:40:24,465 --> 00:40:25,466
Back in a sec.

583
00:40:39,872 --> 00:40:41,656
Baby, are you sure about this?

584
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,919
Yeah, come on. Let's go.

585
00:40:54,277 --> 00:40:55,061
Okay.

586
00:41:30,226 --> 00:41:31,053
Cheers!

587
00:41:32,446 --> 00:41:33,839
Oh, yeah.

588
00:41:33,882 --> 00:41:35,362
- Salud.
-Thank you.

589
00:41:40,323 --> 00:41:41,063
-Ha!
-Whoo!

590
00:41:41,107 --> 00:41:42,108
Whoo mama.

591
00:41:45,111 --> 00:41:47,374
-Come here.
-Oh baby.

592
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:48,680
Yeah.

593
00:41:52,248 --> 00:41:54,599
Let's lose some
of these clothes.

594
00:41:54,642 --> 00:41:56,557
I'll take care of that.
I'll take care of that.

595
00:41:56,601 --> 00:41:57,602
You first.

596
00:41:57,645 --> 00:42:01,127
Oh!

597
00:42:14,227 --> 00:42:16,316
Why do you carry handcuffs?

598
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:19,537
Duh. All cops do, silly.

599
00:42:21,408 --> 00:42:23,541
Oo, what's this?

600
00:42:24,803 --> 00:42:25,586
Aw, I was just-

601
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:26,718
I knew you were fun.

602
00:42:28,502 --> 00:42:30,722
You didn't tell
me you were a cop.

603
00:42:30,765 --> 00:42:33,072
Detective actually.

604
00:42:33,115 --> 00:42:35,596
I don't mention it because
the idea of a strong woman

605
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,337
turns a lot of guys off.

606
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,599
Right, right, right.

607
00:42:38,643 --> 00:42:40,558
But I didn't get
that vibe from you.

608
00:42:40,601 --> 00:42:41,733
Actually I um...

609
00:42:45,475 --> 00:42:46,912
That's my phone.

610
00:42:46,955 --> 00:42:50,916
I have to, it could be
a patient emergency.

611
00:42:50,959 --> 00:42:51,743
Thanks.

612
00:42:53,092 --> 00:42:54,789
It is a patient.

613
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:55,660
It's an emergency.

614
00:42:55,703 --> 00:42:56,835
Heart rate is spiking.

615
00:42:56,878 --> 00:42:58,358
I'm sorry. I have to go.

616
00:42:58,401 --> 00:42:59,489
-I get it.
-I'm sorry.

617
00:42:59,533 --> 00:43:00,621
I have to go.

618
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,406
We'll take a rain check.

619
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:05,713
Absolutely, we will.

620
00:43:05,757 --> 00:43:09,064
Don't for a second think
you're getting away that easy.

621
00:43:10,326 --> 00:43:11,153
Oh baby.

622
00:43:24,993 --> 00:43:25,777
Alex.

623
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:26,691
-Alex.
-Hey come on.

624
00:43:26,734 --> 00:43:28,431
You can catch me if I faint.

625
00:43:28,475 --> 00:43:29,302
Oh, God.

626
00:43:30,259 --> 00:43:32,871
-Alex!
-Hey, how are you?

627
00:43:32,914 --> 00:43:34,176
I miss you.

628
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:36,439
We're going
crazy tonight.

629
00:43:36,483 --> 00:43:37,876
Alex! Here.

630
00:43:37,919 --> 00:43:38,833
Thank you.

631
00:43:42,663 --> 00:43:43,664
What are you doing?

632
00:43:43,708 --> 00:43:44,360
-What?
-I want to dance.

633
00:43:44,404 --> 00:43:45,797
-Alex!
-Please.

634
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,928
-Alex!
-Come on.

635
00:43:46,972 --> 00:43:49,627
-You wanna do too much.
-Just one night.

636
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:50,758
We'll go slow, I promise.

637
00:43:50,802 --> 00:43:51,890
Slow, all right?

638
00:43:53,195 --> 00:43:53,979
I promise if you start
spitting up, I'm done.

639
00:43:54,022 --> 00:43:55,720
I'm serious. Please.

640
00:43:56,721 --> 00:43:57,591
-Okay.
-Okay.

641
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:58,766
Is this a good pace?

642
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:00,942
I like it. Maybe
a little slower.

643
00:44:08,907 --> 00:44:11,083
This party's gonna
be so dope. I can't wait.

644
00:44:24,966 --> 00:44:26,054
What is she doing?

645
00:44:30,102 --> 00:44:30,929
Man.

646
00:44:33,018 --> 00:44:34,933
So this is your song?

647
00:44:36,761 --> 00:44:37,805
Oh, so you wanna dance?

648
00:44:37,849 --> 00:44:38,850
Yeah. Oh you wanna.

649
00:44:38,893 --> 00:44:40,286
Oh okay.

650
00:44:40,329 --> 00:44:41,156
Yeah.

651
00:44:57,738 --> 00:44:58,434
No baby.

652
00:44:58,478 --> 00:44:59,827
You've got to slow down.

653
00:45:01,786 --> 00:45:04,789
-No, no. No.

654
00:45:17,758 --> 00:45:18,977
Hello.

655
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:20,195
Sorry to call so late
but I'm getting some

656
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:23,111
weird readings on
Alex's pacemaker app.

657
00:45:23,155 --> 00:45:24,156
Weird how?

658
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:25,548
Well the locations
are all screwy,

659
00:45:25,592 --> 00:45:28,334
but can you check on
her just so I know?

660
00:45:28,377 --> 00:45:30,292
Oh sure. Hang on.

661
00:45:37,778 --> 00:45:39,084
Alex?

662
00:45:42,827 --> 00:45:43,784
She's not here.

663
00:45:43,828 --> 00:45:45,917
So the app isn't broken?

664
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,440
Where does it say she is?

665
00:45:47,483 --> 00:45:48,528
I'll go get her.

666
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:54,099
What are you doing?

667
00:45:54,142 --> 00:45:55,013
What is this?

668
00:45:55,056 --> 00:45:56,275
I don't know what this is.

669
00:45:56,318 --> 00:45:57,885
All right. Okay well
you're gonna go for it.

670
00:45:57,929 --> 00:45:59,495
I'm going.

671
00:45:59,539 --> 00:46:00,758
I mean time to go for it.

672
00:46:00,801 --> 00:46:01,889
Let's go, all right.

673
00:46:01,933 --> 00:46:04,283
Okay. Okay.

674
00:46:05,284 --> 00:46:06,285
-Okay, I'm gonna spin.
-Ooh!

675
00:46:06,328 --> 00:46:07,503
Okay. Okay.

676
00:46:13,074 --> 00:46:13,945
Let's go.

677
00:46:13,988 --> 00:46:14,946
Mom, what are you doing here?

678
00:46:14,989 --> 00:46:17,122
Alex, I am not kidding.

679
00:46:17,165 --> 00:46:18,036
You let her do this?

680
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:18,906
No ma'am.

681
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:21,343
-Not good.

682
00:46:21,387 --> 00:46:22,431
We'll talk about this at home.

683
00:46:22,475 --> 00:46:24,129
-Come on.
-No, I'm staying here.

684
00:46:24,912 --> 00:46:25,870
Baby, baby. Whoa, whoa.

685
00:46:25,913 --> 00:46:27,915
-Whoa, whoa, hey, hey.
-Baby?

686
00:46:31,484 --> 00:46:32,877
Alex? Talk to me.

687
00:46:36,097 --> 00:46:37,795
-Baby.
-I need to sit down.

688
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:38,665
Okay.

689
00:46:41,189 --> 00:46:42,495
Irresponsible.

690
00:46:44,105 --> 00:46:48,153
All of you, you know this
could kill her, right?

691
00:46:49,241 --> 00:46:51,199
-Do you even care?

692
00:46:56,901 --> 00:46:57,771
Hi Chris.

693
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,120
I just found her.

694
00:46:59,164 --> 00:47:00,556
Great.

695
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:01,601
Look, I know you're probably
really upset right now

696
00:47:01,644 --> 00:47:04,082
but we need to calm her down.

697
00:47:04,125 --> 00:47:05,866
Her heart rate is too high.

698
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:07,085
So let her know you love her

699
00:47:07,128 --> 00:47:08,564
and everything's
gonna be all right.

700
00:47:08,608 --> 00:47:10,828
And please get her
some cold water.

701
00:47:12,003 --> 00:47:14,570
Maggie, I know you're
pissed, but do it for Alex.

702
00:47:14,614 --> 00:47:16,094
Okay?

703
00:47:16,137 --> 00:47:16,964
Come on.

704
00:47:20,663 --> 00:47:23,449
Baby, you're gonna be okay.

705
00:47:24,406 --> 00:47:27,105
I'm sorry that I
embarrassed you.

706
00:47:27,148 --> 00:47:28,019
I love you.

707
00:47:29,934 --> 00:47:31,631
Great job. That's better.

708
00:47:31,674 --> 00:47:33,372
I will meet you at the house.

709
00:47:35,069 --> 00:47:36,941
-Yeah.
-You're okay.

710
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:42,903
-I'm scared.
-I know, baby.

711
00:47:42,947 --> 00:47:44,862
-It's okay.
-I'm sorry.

712
00:47:45,775 --> 00:47:47,038
I just don't get it, Alex.

713
00:47:49,518 --> 00:47:52,434
What were you thinking?

714
00:47:52,478 --> 00:47:55,698
I just wanted to get out
and have fun for like a few.

715
00:47:55,742 --> 00:47:57,091
Is that what you
thought you were doing?

716
00:47:57,135 --> 00:47:58,919
'Cause I'd say it's more
like toying with your life.

717
00:47:58,963 --> 00:48:02,096
You could have
passed out or worse.

718
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:03,750
Why would you help
her sneak out?

719
00:48:03,793 --> 00:48:04,533
No, I didn't--

720
00:48:04,577 --> 00:48:06,057
It's not Scott's fault.

721
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,146
I was going with or without him.

722
00:48:08,189 --> 00:48:10,104
He just came to
keep an eye on me.

723
00:48:12,628 --> 00:48:15,066
At least he didn't rat me out.

724
00:48:15,109 --> 00:48:16,937
Alex, I'm here to keep you safe.

725
00:48:16,981 --> 00:48:19,026
I don't understand.

726
00:48:20,114 --> 00:48:22,073
Are you trying to kill yourself?

727
00:48:22,116 --> 00:48:23,248
No!

728
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:25,946
Then what? Explain it to me.

729
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:27,687
It's my life.

730
00:48:29,994 --> 00:48:32,039
I don't want to
live it like he did.

731
00:48:34,259 --> 00:48:35,086
You mean your dad?

732
00:48:36,087 --> 00:48:37,305
Look, if I'm gonna die,

733
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:38,959
I just, I just want to
live first, before--

734
00:48:39,003 --> 00:48:42,006
Alex, you are not going to die!

735
00:48:42,049 --> 00:48:45,096
Mom, a heart's not coming.

736
00:48:45,139 --> 00:48:46,924
Not in time.

737
00:48:46,967 --> 00:48:47,794
It's not.

738
00:48:49,578 --> 00:48:51,972
You just need to
face it, like I have.

739
00:48:52,016 --> 00:48:54,148
I just want to use
what time I have left.

740
00:48:55,323 --> 00:49:01,590
No matter how much or
how little that may be.

741
00:49:01,634 --> 00:49:05,246
I'm not gonna spend it
trapped in a bed like dad was.

742
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:06,726
That's how I remember him.

743
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:10,904
Sick, bed bound.

744
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,561
Those are my last
memories of him.

745
00:49:15,604 --> 00:49:16,344
Oh baby.

746
00:49:16,388 --> 00:49:17,911
Not the man that he was.

747
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:21,175
And that's, that's not
gonna be how I'm remembered.

748
00:49:23,003 --> 00:49:25,963
So, don't even think about
checking me into a hospital.

749
00:49:26,006 --> 00:49:28,617
'Cause I, I won't go.

750
00:49:30,141 --> 00:49:33,927
Alex, you can't give up hope.

751
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,363
I'm not.

752
00:49:35,407 --> 00:49:38,192
But I'm not gonna
pretend either.

753
00:49:38,236 --> 00:49:39,541
I'm just facing reality.

754
00:49:43,806 --> 00:49:44,851
Maybe you should, too.

755
00:49:49,856 --> 00:49:51,205
Well, I'm exhausted.

756
00:49:51,249 --> 00:49:52,119
I'm going to bed.

757
00:49:52,163 --> 00:49:53,425
Here, let me help.

758
00:49:53,468 --> 00:49:54,208
Don't.

759
00:49:54,252 --> 00:49:55,775
Scott can help me.

760
00:50:01,824 --> 00:50:02,738
Goodnight, baby.

761
00:50:06,568 --> 00:50:11,008
Oh, oh, everything
is gonna be okay.

762
00:50:13,793 --> 00:50:16,317
She's right about her dad.

763
00:50:19,233 --> 00:50:21,366
Once he got into that
bed he never came out,

764
00:50:21,409 --> 00:50:24,282
he just...withered.

765
00:50:25,457 --> 00:50:26,284
Oh my god.

766
00:50:27,546 --> 00:50:29,504
I'm gonna lose my baby girl.

767
00:50:29,548 --> 00:50:31,158
No, I won't--

768
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,509
That's not gonna happen.

769
00:50:34,553 --> 00:50:35,771
I promise you.

770
00:50:37,295 --> 00:50:38,296
You can't.

771
00:50:38,339 --> 00:50:39,819
Even I can't.

772
00:50:39,862 --> 00:50:42,822
The odds of a donor
popping up in time?

773
00:50:42,865 --> 00:50:44,258
One will.

774
00:50:44,302 --> 00:50:46,304
I've been doing
this a long time.

775
00:50:46,347 --> 00:50:47,827
These things, these
things have a way

776
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:50,743
of working themselves out.

777
00:50:52,266 --> 00:50:53,572
Trust me.

778
00:50:53,615 --> 00:50:55,443
How can you be so sure?

779
00:50:55,487 --> 00:50:57,532
Let's just call it gut instinct.

780
00:51:07,151 --> 00:51:09,196
It's gonna be okay.

781
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,893
It's gonna be okay.

782
00:51:28,172 --> 00:51:28,998
Good morning.

783
00:51:36,005 --> 00:51:37,964
How are you feeling?

784
00:51:38,007 --> 00:51:38,834
Fine.

785
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,098
Look...

786
00:51:43,622 --> 00:51:45,885
I know you're mad
at me about last night,

787
00:51:45,928 --> 00:51:48,931
but my job is to keep you safe.

788
00:51:50,019 --> 00:51:52,892
And if that makes me the
bad guy, then I'll wear that

789
00:51:52,935 --> 00:51:54,067
like a badge of honor.

790
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:56,896
Just to make up for it...

791
00:51:58,419 --> 00:51:59,986
I brought you a little surprise.

792
00:52:12,825 --> 00:52:14,000
Oh my God.

793
00:52:14,043 --> 00:52:15,306
I know how much it meant to you.

794
00:52:15,349 --> 00:52:17,569
So, I got you a new one.

795
00:52:23,183 --> 00:52:24,706
I can't take this.

796
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:26,621
You really shouldn't
be buying me things.

797
00:52:26,665 --> 00:52:29,189
Oh no, yes, yes, no.

798
00:52:29,233 --> 00:52:31,452
I am here to help you heal.

799
00:52:31,496 --> 00:52:34,977
And in my experience
patients do that faster

800
00:52:35,021 --> 00:52:37,284
when they're surrounded by
things they love.

801
00:52:55,781 --> 00:52:58,871
You're gonna put
yourself out of a job.

802
00:53:04,224 --> 00:53:05,747
Good as new.

803
00:53:05,791 --> 00:53:07,053
Just like you'll be soon.

804
00:53:16,018 --> 00:53:17,498
This is Maggie Newell.

805
00:53:17,542 --> 00:53:19,021
Hi,
this is Grace from 911,

806
00:53:19,065 --> 00:53:20,414
following up on your inquiry.

807
00:53:20,458 --> 00:53:21,502
Oh yes.

808
00:53:21,546 --> 00:53:23,156
Thank you for
getting back to me.

809
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,158
I was just wondering if I
could get some information

810
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,073
on the night of my
daughter's emergency.

811
00:53:27,116 --> 00:53:28,335
The call definitely

812
00:53:28,379 --> 00:53:29,641
came from your
daughter's phone.

813
00:53:29,684 --> 00:53:31,164
The audio has been deleted

814
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,426
but I was the dispatcher
who took the call.

815
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:34,123
Oh, you were? Great.

816
00:53:35,299 --> 00:53:38,911
Did you notice
anything...unusual

817
00:53:38,954 --> 00:53:40,217
about my daughter's call?

818
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,261
Your daughter
wasn't the one

819
00:53:41,305 --> 00:53:43,045
who made the call, ma'am.

820
00:53:43,089 --> 00:53:44,090
It was a man.

821
00:53:45,047 --> 00:53:46,614
-A man?
-Yes ma'am.

822
00:53:47,572 --> 00:53:48,486
Are you sure?

823
00:53:48,529 --> 00:53:50,357
Yes ma'am.

824
00:53:50,401 --> 00:53:53,186
He sounded older, whoever he
was, he had medical knowledge.

825
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:54,318
I hope that helps.

826
00:53:55,928 --> 00:53:59,627
Not really, but thank
you for the information.

827
00:53:59,671 --> 00:54:02,108
-No problem.
-Okay, bye.

828
00:54:15,208 --> 00:54:16,949
No, next week won't work.

829
00:54:16,992 --> 00:54:19,212
I need to see him
as soon as possible.

830
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:21,475
So sir, are
you having dark thoughts?

831
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:23,999
Am I having dark thoughts?

832
00:54:24,043 --> 00:54:27,655
-Yes.
-Well, yes, actually, I am.

833
00:54:27,699 --> 00:54:29,222
How dark, exactly?

834
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,484
Very dark.

835
00:54:30,528 --> 00:54:33,052
Which is why I need to
speak to someone today.

836
00:54:33,095 --> 00:54:34,967
-End of the day?
-End of the day is fine.

837
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:36,055
-Okay.
-Yeah.

838
00:54:36,098 --> 00:54:38,057
-- 30?
-- 30 is perfect.

839
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:39,841
-You're all set.
-Thank you.

840
00:54:42,322 --> 00:54:44,542
Are you sure that
this is a good idea?

841
00:54:44,585 --> 00:54:45,934
Why wouldn't it be?

842
00:54:45,978 --> 00:54:47,762
'Cause he's a psychiatrist,

843
00:54:47,806 --> 00:54:49,547
they're trained to read people.

844
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:51,723
What if he figures
out what you're doing?

845
00:54:53,028 --> 00:54:56,467
I would just hate if anything
happened to you because of me.

846
00:54:56,510 --> 00:55:00,122
That is so sweet, but
everything's gonna be fine.

847
00:55:00,166 --> 00:55:01,167
He's a match.

848
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:02,603
That's all that matters.

849
00:55:02,647 --> 00:55:03,474
It'll be fine.

850
00:55:12,134 --> 00:55:16,400
So Mr. Johnson, my service noted

851
00:55:16,443 --> 00:55:19,011
you were having
violent thoughts.

852
00:55:19,054 --> 00:55:20,012
Sure. Sometimes.

853
00:55:20,055 --> 00:55:23,102
But I mean, don't we all?

854
00:55:23,145 --> 00:55:25,800
These thoughts about harming
yourself or harming others?

855
00:55:25,844 --> 00:55:27,193
Others, definitely.

856
00:55:30,065 --> 00:55:32,111
But only when it's
absolutely necessary.

857
00:55:35,244 --> 00:55:37,159
When is violence necessary?

858
00:55:38,378 --> 00:55:42,469
Sometimes you have to
make sacrifices, you know?

859
00:55:43,905 --> 00:55:46,212
Sometimes you have to
sacrifice for love, Doctor.

860
00:55:47,126 --> 00:55:49,781
Do you believe in love?
True love.

861
00:55:51,652 --> 00:55:52,871
Unconditional.

862
00:55:54,089 --> 00:55:57,136
So there's a woman
involved, or a man.

863
00:55:57,179 --> 00:55:58,398
A very special young woman.

864
00:55:59,878 --> 00:56:00,705
How young?

865
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:06,101
Let's talk about
you for a minute.

866
00:56:06,145 --> 00:56:07,364
Got any hobbies?

867
00:56:08,539 --> 00:56:10,628
Any sports you play to keep fit?

868
00:56:11,803 --> 00:56:13,544
I'm sensing a lot
of conflict in you.

869
00:56:13,587 --> 00:56:15,110
-Conflict?
-Mmhmm.

870
00:56:15,154 --> 00:56:16,851
-No.
-It seems to stem

871
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:19,201
from this young
woman you mentioned.

872
00:56:19,245 --> 00:56:21,595
You know what you're
doing is wrong.

873
00:56:23,075 --> 00:56:26,295
But your need to love so that
you can be loved in return,

874
00:56:26,339 --> 00:56:27,819
drives you to do it anyway.

875
00:56:29,255 --> 00:56:32,171
I'm not a big fan of
this psycho-babble stuff.

876
00:56:33,825 --> 00:56:35,740
You came for my help, yes?

877
00:56:35,783 --> 00:56:37,698
Well yes, absolutely.

878
00:56:37,742 --> 00:56:39,570
And I have no doubt
that you can help me.

879
00:56:39,613 --> 00:56:40,875
It's just, I don't...

880
00:56:43,312 --> 00:56:45,793
I don't like people
poking around in my head.

881
00:56:47,752 --> 00:56:49,623
You've been to therapy before.

882
00:56:49,667 --> 00:56:50,798
Once or twice.

883
00:56:52,234 --> 00:56:54,193
But let's just say it never
quite worked out for me.

884
00:56:56,630 --> 00:56:59,285
What did you talk about with
your previous therapist?

885
00:56:59,328 --> 00:57:00,460
Well, you know, the usual.

886
00:57:00,504 --> 00:57:01,766
Think good thoughts.

887
00:57:02,897 --> 00:57:04,595
Don't listen to the bad
voices in your head.

888
00:57:04,638 --> 00:57:05,465
Voices?

889
00:57:07,032 --> 00:57:08,816
Tell me about the voices.

890
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:09,817
There's nothing really to tell.

891
00:57:09,861 --> 00:57:13,647
I mean, they're just...voices.

892
00:57:13,691 --> 00:57:15,606
These voices ever appear to you?

893
00:57:15,649 --> 00:57:17,825
I mean, do you, do you
ever see people who, um...

894
00:57:19,784 --> 00:57:21,568
are not really there?

895
00:57:21,612 --> 00:57:23,352
Come on, man.

896
00:57:23,396 --> 00:57:24,484
I'm not crazy.

897
00:57:25,529 --> 00:57:29,184
I just have an
overactive imagination.

898
00:57:30,925 --> 00:57:32,927
Mr. Johnson, I'm
concerned about you.

899
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,975
I will prescribe you
something for your anxiety.

900
00:57:37,018 --> 00:57:38,063
Thank you.

901
00:57:38,106 --> 00:57:38,977
But I do--

902
00:57:40,239 --> 00:57:41,283
Excuse me.

903
00:57:42,676 --> 00:57:47,725
I do think that we need
to set up weekly meetings

904
00:57:47,768 --> 00:57:50,728
to discuss these voices.

905
00:57:50,771 --> 00:57:54,688
Just to make sure that these
voices that you're hearing

906
00:57:54,732 --> 00:57:57,256
don't manifest into
anything more physical.

907
00:58:02,435 --> 00:58:05,830
Doc, ya helped me already.

908
00:58:07,048 --> 00:58:09,137
Anxiety-free.

909
00:58:09,181 --> 00:58:10,138
Lucky me.

910
00:59:11,286 --> 00:59:12,723
Oh my god.

911
01:00:28,059 --> 01:00:28,886
-Help!

912
01:00:30,714 --> 01:00:31,540
Buddy!

913
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:35,806
Where ya going?

914
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:38,896
Stay back.

915
01:00:38,939 --> 01:00:39,984
Stay back.

916
01:00:40,027 --> 01:00:41,507
Look, there's
nowhere left to run.

917
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:43,204
Be reasonable here.

918
01:00:43,248 --> 01:00:45,685
I can't have you
damaging that heart.

919
01:00:45,729 --> 01:00:47,078
I need it.

920
01:00:47,121 --> 01:00:47,948
You're insane.

921
01:00:49,341 --> 01:00:51,952
That's a little judgmental
of you, isn't it Doc?

922
01:00:51,996 --> 01:00:54,085
Judgmental, you want
to hear judgmental?

923
01:00:54,128 --> 01:00:56,087
-Sure.
-How about this?

924
01:00:56,130 --> 01:01:01,005
You're a hyper-neurotic,
egotistical narcissistic freak.

925
01:01:02,441 --> 01:01:04,835
You deserve to be
locked away forever.

926
01:01:04,878 --> 01:01:07,402
In fact, in fact,

927
01:01:08,839 --> 01:01:11,798
prepare to go to jail for
the rest of your life,

928
01:01:11,842 --> 01:01:13,017
-you son of a--

929
01:01:16,934 --> 01:01:18,239
Well that heart's no good.

930
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:20,677
Man.

931
01:01:36,997 --> 01:01:38,390
The cause of the fire

932
01:01:38,433 --> 01:01:40,000
at the Abernathy
state mental hospital

933
01:01:40,044 --> 01:01:41,785
is still under investigation,

934
01:01:41,828 --> 01:01:44,309
but authorities now strongly
suspect that it was arson

935
01:01:44,352 --> 01:01:45,963
and that it was an inside job.

936
01:01:46,006 --> 01:01:47,747
So far the bodies
of three people

937
01:01:47,791 --> 01:01:49,314
have been pulled from the rubble

938
01:01:49,357 --> 01:01:51,185
and positively identified
as hospital staff.

939
01:01:51,229 --> 01:01:54,014
But several high security
inmates are still missing

940
01:01:54,058 --> 01:01:55,668
-and it is not clear--
-Oh God.

941
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,496
if they perished in the fire

942
01:01:57,539 --> 01:01:59,933
or somehow managed to escape
in the mayhem that followed.

943
01:02:14,992 --> 01:02:16,080
Good morning.

944
01:02:17,081 --> 01:02:19,213
So how's Alex today?

945
01:02:19,257 --> 01:02:20,867
She's tired.

946
01:02:20,911 --> 01:02:22,477
Says she feels weak.

947
01:02:22,521 --> 01:02:24,392
Scott's upstairs with her.

948
01:02:24,436 --> 01:02:25,742
Terrific.

949
01:02:25,785 --> 01:02:28,483
I have to make a stop
on the way into work.

950
01:02:28,527 --> 01:02:31,182
Have you noticed anything
odd around the house?

951
01:02:31,225 --> 01:02:34,794
Like signs of someone
else being here?

952
01:02:34,838 --> 01:02:36,970
Someone else being here?

953
01:02:37,014 --> 01:02:37,884
No.

954
01:02:37,928 --> 01:02:39,146
What about in the neighborhood?

955
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:41,192
Anyone who looks like
they don't belong?

956
01:02:41,235 --> 01:02:42,062
Why do ask?

957
01:02:45,239 --> 01:02:47,024
Just wondering.

958
01:02:48,155 --> 01:02:49,200
I'll check in later.

959
01:02:49,243 --> 01:02:50,027
Okay.

960
01:02:56,685 --> 01:02:57,469
Okay.

961
01:03:10,569 --> 01:03:12,397
Hey!

962
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:13,702
You fixed it!

963
01:03:15,879 --> 01:03:17,402
No.

964
01:03:17,445 --> 01:03:19,012
Nurse Chris
bought me a new one.

965
01:03:21,101 --> 01:03:22,189
He bought that for you?

966
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:25,149
Don't you think
that's a little odd?

967
01:03:25,192 --> 01:03:28,456
I mean at first, yeah,
but then he explained

968
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:31,677
how it's like part of
the healing process.

969
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:34,114
How things that make you happy
help you heal faster.

970
01:03:34,158 --> 01:03:35,246
You mean like me?

971
01:03:41,556 --> 01:03:42,775
I'd give you my
heart if I could.

972
01:03:44,603 --> 01:03:46,257
If anything ever happens to me

973
01:03:47,432 --> 01:03:49,738
I want you to have it.

974
01:03:49,782 --> 01:03:51,131
See, we're the same blood type.

975
01:03:52,263 --> 01:03:53,394
We match.

976
01:03:55,309 --> 01:03:58,138
I mean, it's like we're
meant to be together.

977
01:03:58,182 --> 01:03:59,487
Like it was fate.

978
01:04:18,202 --> 01:04:19,856
Alrighty, here we go.

979
01:04:26,471 --> 01:04:27,298
Nice!

980
01:04:34,653 --> 01:04:36,263
Same blood type.

981
01:04:41,051 --> 01:04:43,096
Fate indeed.

982
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:50,321
Knock knock.

983
01:04:50,364 --> 01:04:51,496
Oh, Scott, hi.

984
01:04:51,539 --> 01:04:53,019
I didn't know you were here.

985
01:04:53,063 --> 01:04:54,107
Oh, hey man.

986
01:04:54,151 --> 01:04:55,935
Well, I made tea.

987
01:04:55,979 --> 01:04:58,285
You can have mine, Scott.

988
01:04:58,329 --> 01:04:59,199
I'm good.

989
01:04:59,243 --> 01:05:00,897
No, I insist.

990
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:01,941
Plenty of herbs in this stuff.

991
01:05:01,985 --> 01:05:04,117
Good for everybody.

992
01:05:05,771 --> 01:05:06,772
Here you go pal.

993
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:08,382
If you insist.

994
01:05:08,426 --> 01:05:09,949
Will you all excuse
me for a second?

995
01:05:09,993 --> 01:05:12,299
-Mmhmm.
-We'll be right here.

996
01:05:19,611 --> 01:05:21,178
-So Chris...
-Mmhmm?

997
01:05:21,221 --> 01:05:22,570
Can I ask you something?

998
01:05:22,614 --> 01:05:23,354
Yes.

999
01:05:23,397 --> 01:05:25,008
You have a girlfriend?

1000
01:05:25,051 --> 01:05:26,313
I do.

1001
01:05:26,357 --> 01:05:28,968
Someone very special,
if you must know.

1002
01:05:29,012 --> 01:05:30,230
Oh yeah?

1003
01:05:30,274 --> 01:05:31,231
So what's her name?

1004
01:05:36,889 --> 01:05:38,499
-Spanish.
-Something like that.

1005
01:05:38,543 --> 01:05:39,805
Oh right.

1006
01:05:39,848 --> 01:05:41,633
Make sure Alex drinks her tea.

1007
01:05:43,026 --> 01:05:44,157
Will do, man.

1008
01:06:02,697 --> 01:06:05,439
Scott? Scott!

1009
01:06:05,483 --> 01:06:06,919
What's the matter?

1010
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:08,181
Chris! Nurse Chris!

1011
01:06:09,052 --> 01:06:11,706
Hey, hey, wake up, hey, Scott.

1012
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:12,838
Scott wake up.

1013
01:06:12,881 --> 01:06:14,013
Scott, Scott.

1014
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:16,755
You should have some more tea.

1015
01:06:17,669 --> 01:06:18,800
What are you talking about?

1016
01:06:18,844 --> 01:06:19,714
Something's wrong with Scott.

1017
01:06:19,758 --> 01:06:21,368
We have to call an ambulance.

1018
01:06:21,412 --> 01:06:22,935
Actually everything
is just right.

1019
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:23,849
What are you talking about?

1020
01:06:23,892 --> 01:06:24,850
Something's wrong with Scott!

1021
01:06:24,893 --> 01:06:26,069
I can't wake him up.

1022
01:06:26,112 --> 01:06:28,462
I know, that's because
he's, he sedated.

1023
01:06:28,506 --> 01:06:29,289
He'll be fine.

1024
01:06:31,683 --> 01:06:33,293
What?

1025
01:06:33,337 --> 01:06:34,468
I found it, Alex.

1026
01:06:34,512 --> 01:06:35,817
I found your heart

1027
01:06:35,861 --> 01:06:37,123
and it was right in front
of me the whole time

1028
01:06:37,167 --> 01:06:39,038
and I didn't even know it.

1029
01:06:39,082 --> 01:06:40,387
What are you, what
are you talking about?

1030
01:06:40,431 --> 01:06:42,868
Scott! He's a match.

1031
01:06:42,911 --> 01:06:44,348
I can save you again.

1032
01:06:45,436 --> 01:06:46,176
Again?

1033
01:06:46,219 --> 01:06:47,481
I was the one Alex.

1034
01:06:47,525 --> 01:06:48,917
I was the one who
found you that night.

1035
01:06:48,961 --> 01:06:51,703
-I called 911.
-You?

1036
01:06:51,746 --> 01:06:53,052
Yeah, I was here in the attic.

1037
01:06:56,969 --> 01:06:58,231
Yeah. I was watching from above.

1038
01:06:58,275 --> 01:06:59,928
If I hadn't have been,
you'd be dead.

1039
01:06:59,972 --> 01:07:01,191
Don't you see, it was fate.

1040
01:07:01,234 --> 01:07:02,975
I was meant to be
here to save ya.

1041
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:05,804
Now with Scott I
can save you again.

1042
01:07:07,066 --> 01:07:08,850
Oh my god, you're crazy.

1043
01:07:11,114 --> 01:07:12,550
Why do people keep saying that?

1044
01:07:13,725 --> 01:07:15,683
Alex you've got to calm down.

1045
01:07:15,727 --> 01:07:17,424
That's why I drugged your tea.

1046
01:07:17,468 --> 01:07:19,035
So your heart wouldn't go crazy.

1047
01:07:20,166 --> 01:07:21,515
Just trust me Alex.

1048
01:07:21,559 --> 01:07:23,778
And you'll wake up
with a brand new heart.

1049
01:07:25,345 --> 01:07:28,087
-Get away from me!

1050
01:07:28,131 --> 01:07:28,870
Alex, Alex, Alex.

1051
01:07:28,914 --> 01:07:31,047
I did it for us.

1052
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:33,962
I did it for us, Alex.

1053
01:07:56,159 --> 01:07:57,029
Oh.

1054
01:07:58,509 --> 01:08:00,859
Don't you worry.

1055
01:08:00,902 --> 01:08:03,079
I'll fix everything.

1056
01:08:22,185 --> 01:08:23,664
I need some help.

1057
01:08:23,708 --> 01:08:25,144
I found that in my attic.

1058
01:08:25,188 --> 01:08:26,276
One moment, please.

1059
01:08:28,887 --> 01:08:32,978
I think someone was living
in there, an escaped patient.

1060
01:08:33,021 --> 01:08:34,414
Gotta call you back.

1061
01:08:36,677 --> 01:08:39,637
I'm afraid they
might be dangerous.

1062
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:40,594
Wait right here.

1063
01:08:47,993 --> 01:08:49,864
Hi, I'm Detective Matthews.

1064
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:52,215
You said you found
this in your attic?

1065
01:08:52,258 --> 01:08:53,129
Yeah.

1066
01:08:55,261 --> 01:08:56,132
Follow me.

1067
01:08:59,178 --> 01:09:00,266
Nice and snug.

1068
01:09:04,183 --> 01:09:05,619
Man oh man.

1069
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:06,751
Hate to be you.

1070
01:09:09,884 --> 01:09:10,711
What's it say?

1071
01:09:12,974 --> 01:09:16,195
It looks like this place got
hit by a pretty bad fire.

1072
01:09:16,239 --> 01:09:17,544
And now they're
thinking it was arson,

1073
01:09:17,588 --> 01:09:20,243
probably set by one
of the patients.

1074
01:09:20,286 --> 01:09:21,983
And it looks like a
few of the inmates

1075
01:09:22,027 --> 01:09:23,681
were unaccounted for.

1076
01:09:23,724 --> 01:09:26,118
Hospital folks thought they
must've burned up in the fire

1077
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:27,859
but I guess one of them got away

1078
01:09:27,902 --> 01:09:29,513
and decided to
squat at your place.

1079
01:09:29,556 --> 01:09:31,558
Do you have photos of them?

1080
01:09:31,602 --> 01:09:33,386
Let me see.

1081
01:09:49,141 --> 01:09:50,186
What the f--

1082
01:10:01,632 --> 01:10:04,939
Suspect should be considered
extremely dangerous.

1083
01:10:04,983 --> 01:10:07,028
If possible, let me
take the bastard down.

1084
01:10:07,072 --> 01:10:09,030
-Come on Alex, answer.

1085
01:10:09,074 --> 01:10:11,250
It's Alex,
leave a message.

1086
01:10:11,294 --> 01:10:13,165
Alex, it's Mom, where are you?

1087
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:14,297
Call me immediately.

1088
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:15,950
Nurse Chris isn't
who he says he is.

1089
01:10:15,994 --> 01:10:18,170
When you get this lock
your bedroom door.

1090
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:19,127
We're on our way.

1091
01:10:20,259 --> 01:10:21,173
Ready? Let's go.

1092
01:10:30,182 --> 01:10:31,052
No, no, no, no.

1093
01:10:31,096 --> 01:10:33,011
Please let me go.

1094
01:10:33,054 --> 01:10:33,838
Untie me!

1095
01:10:33,881 --> 01:10:35,143
Relax. Relax.

1096
01:10:35,187 --> 01:10:37,233
Everything's gonna be fine.

1097
01:10:37,276 --> 01:10:38,756
I've done this a million times.

1098
01:10:40,279 --> 01:10:41,454
Oh my god, Scott!

1099
01:10:41,498 --> 01:10:42,760
Scott, wake up!

1100
01:10:42,803 --> 01:10:44,892
You've got to try to calm down.

1101
01:10:44,936 --> 01:10:46,677
The strain is bad for you.

1102
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:47,939
Who are you?

1103
01:10:49,419 --> 01:10:53,161
Name's Albert Beck,
Dr. Albert Beck.

1104
01:10:53,205 --> 01:10:55,468
And lucky for you,
I'm on call tonight.

1105
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:57,601
Oh my God.

1106
01:10:57,644 --> 01:10:58,776
Help!

1107
01:10:58,819 --> 01:11:00,647
Someone help me.

1108
01:11:00,691 --> 01:11:02,214
Help.

1109
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:04,042
Albert Beck, you're
under arrest.

1110
01:11:08,307 --> 01:11:09,221
-Alex?
-Stop!

1111
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:10,614
-Alex?
-Wait.

1112
01:11:10,657 --> 01:11:12,137
She's not here.

1113
01:11:15,575 --> 01:11:16,620
Oh God.

1114
01:11:17,577 --> 01:11:19,275
Where could he have taken her?

1115
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:21,842
I might have an idea.

1116
01:11:25,106 --> 01:11:28,153
What are the odds of a boy
who already gave you his heart

1117
01:11:29,633 --> 01:11:32,331
could literally
give you his heart?

1118
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:33,637
No, stop!

1119
01:11:35,116 --> 01:11:35,856
It's what Scott wanted.

1120
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:37,118
He said so.

1121
01:11:37,162 --> 01:11:38,337
-No!
-I know,

1122
01:11:38,381 --> 01:11:40,339
he wasn't my first
choice either.

1123
01:11:40,383 --> 01:11:43,081
But the others, they
didn't work out.

1124
01:11:44,648 --> 01:11:45,823
The pacemaker
isn't showing up.

1125
01:11:47,259 --> 01:11:48,695
-Oh come on, show me her signal.

1126
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:51,263
It's not working.

1127
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:52,482
I don't know why.

1128
01:11:52,525 --> 01:11:54,005
He probably disabled it.

1129
01:11:57,704 --> 01:11:58,836
Alex?

1130
01:12:01,099 --> 01:12:03,493
They just found something
at the McCoy home.

1131
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:09,150
Oh my god.

1132
01:12:09,194 --> 01:12:10,587
Those are my daughter's clothes.

1133
01:12:12,850 --> 01:12:15,548
I need all available units
to St. Agatha's Hospital.

1134
01:12:15,592 --> 01:12:17,376
Suspect is believed
to be on location

1135
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:19,726
with one, possibly two hostages.

1136
01:12:21,467 --> 01:12:23,034
Please don't hurt him.

1137
01:12:23,077 --> 01:12:23,991
No, no, no, no.

1138
01:12:24,035 --> 01:12:25,732
Please, please don't.

1139
01:12:26,690 --> 01:12:28,126
But this is what you wanted.

1140
01:12:28,169 --> 01:12:29,649
You asked me for it.

1141
01:12:29,693 --> 01:12:31,303
So we could be together.

1142
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,611
What?

1143
01:12:34,654 --> 01:12:36,656
I never said that.

1144
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:38,136
I never said that.

1145
01:12:40,399 --> 01:12:41,705
He's here.

1146
01:12:41,748 --> 01:12:44,403
All units, we have probable
location of suspect.

1147
01:12:44,447 --> 01:12:46,536
St. Agatha's Hos--

1148
01:12:46,579 --> 01:12:49,103
Get back--

1149
01:13:01,594 --> 01:13:02,595
Ms. Newell!

1150
01:13:04,118 --> 01:13:07,426
There's always an element
of tragedy to these things.

1151
01:13:07,470 --> 01:13:10,255
One person loses their
life so another can live.

1152
01:13:11,952 --> 01:13:13,606
But it'll make for
a great conversation

1153
01:13:13,650 --> 01:13:15,260
with our kids one day, right?

1154
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:21,397
Scott!

1155
01:13:36,194 --> 01:13:38,631
Now, I haven't done
this in a while

1156
01:13:38,675 --> 01:13:41,591
so I might be a little rusty.

1157
01:13:44,637 --> 01:13:46,813
Speaking of a little rusty.

1158
01:13:46,857 --> 01:13:47,684
Hmm.

1159
01:13:51,949 --> 01:13:53,864
I'm begging you, please.

1160
01:13:53,907 --> 01:13:57,607
Hopefully it's
like riding a bike.

1161
01:13:57,650 --> 01:13:59,173
Oh no.

1162
01:13:59,217 --> 01:14:00,827
No, no, no, please!

1163
01:14:00,871 --> 01:14:01,698
Please!

1164
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:04,135
Alex!

1165
01:14:04,178 --> 01:14:05,353
It's Mom!

1166
01:14:05,397 --> 01:14:06,790
Mom? Mom!

1167
01:14:06,833 --> 01:14:08,182
Mom, help!

1168
01:14:08,226 --> 01:14:10,141
Mom, I'm in here.

1169
01:14:10,184 --> 01:14:11,316
Help!

1170
01:14:11,359 --> 01:14:12,796
Mom!

1171
01:14:12,839 --> 01:14:14,711
-Alex.
-Help, I'm in here.

1172
01:14:14,754 --> 01:14:15,886
Mom!

1173
01:14:15,929 --> 01:14:17,409
Help!

1174
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:18,497
Mom!

1175
01:14:18,541 --> 01:14:20,020
Don't you go anywhere.

1176
01:14:21,805 --> 01:14:23,546
Scott? Scott wake up.

1177
01:14:25,330 --> 01:14:26,549
Scott!

1178
01:14:38,430 --> 01:14:39,736
Scott, Scott wake up.

1179
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,741
That's it! That's it!

1180
01:14:44,784 --> 01:14:45,872
Come on.

1181
01:14:48,396 --> 01:14:50,486
Albert Beck, come out
with your hands up.

1182
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:00,670
Hey, hey, hey.

1183
01:15:00,713 --> 01:15:02,498
Wake up, I need you
to wake up, okay?

1184
01:15:02,541 --> 01:15:03,890
Al.

1185
01:15:04,935 --> 01:15:05,805
Wake up, wake up.

1186
01:15:05,849 --> 01:15:07,067
We gotta go. We gotta go.

1187
01:15:23,867 --> 01:15:25,999
Okay. Where were we?

1188
01:15:27,261 --> 01:15:28,088
Oh no.

1189
01:15:36,401 --> 01:15:39,709
Alex, come out, come
out wherever you are.

1190
01:15:39,752 --> 01:15:41,841
Alex! Alex!

1191
01:15:41,885 --> 01:15:43,060
Where are ya?

1192
01:15:43,103 --> 01:15:44,888
I'm your doctor. We
have an appointment.

1193
01:15:45,976 --> 01:15:47,325
Alex!

1194
01:15:47,368 --> 01:15:48,195
Alex!

1195
01:15:49,196 --> 01:15:50,763
Why are you running?

1196
01:15:53,984 --> 01:15:55,725
-Shh, shh.

1197
01:15:55,768 --> 01:15:58,902
I'm doing this for you, for us.

1198
01:16:01,818 --> 01:16:02,906
Alex, please.

1199
01:16:04,647 --> 01:16:05,822
Alex, you need to stop.

1200
01:16:05,865 --> 01:16:07,432
Your heart won't take much more.

1201
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,399
I just want to save you.

1202
01:16:26,886 --> 01:16:27,713
Come on.

1203
01:16:40,639 --> 01:16:43,511
Scott, I need your help.

1204
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,481
Hey, it looks like
I saved you again.

1205
01:16:56,524 --> 01:16:58,309
Get away from me.

1206
01:16:58,352 --> 01:16:59,876
Don't touch me.

1207
01:16:59,919 --> 01:17:01,617
Alex, stop fighting this.

1208
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:03,836
This is for you, all of it.

1209
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:07,405
Alex, I'm doing this
because I love you.

1210
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:10,495
I don't love you.

1211
01:17:10,538 --> 01:17:11,931
It's okay.

1212
01:17:11,975 --> 01:17:14,412
I love you enough
for the both of us.

1213
01:17:14,455 --> 01:17:16,196
And when you have your new heart

1214
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:18,068
I know you'll see
things differently.

1215
01:17:23,464 --> 01:17:27,425
Listen Alex, now Scott
can die for nothing

1216
01:17:27,468 --> 01:17:28,687
or Scott can die for you.

1217
01:17:30,515 --> 01:17:31,603
Take my hand.

1218
01:17:33,605 --> 01:17:35,302
-Alex.
-Alex!

1219
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:39,959
-Mom!
-Oh baby.

1220
01:17:40,003 --> 01:17:41,874
Oh, careful.

1221
01:17:41,918 --> 01:17:43,049
You're okay.

1222
01:17:43,093 --> 01:17:44,137
You're okay.

1223
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:46,836
The police are here.

1224
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:47,793
It's over.

1225
01:17:50,448 --> 01:17:52,406
She's dying.

1226
01:17:52,450 --> 01:17:53,669
Look at her.

1227
01:17:53,712 --> 01:17:54,931
I can save her.

1228
01:17:56,933 --> 01:17:58,543
I can save her.

1229
01:18:04,636 --> 01:18:06,943
You'll have to kill me first.

1230
01:18:06,986 --> 01:18:08,161
Oh come on.

1231
01:18:15,516 --> 01:18:19,564
Okay.

1232
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:24,612
-Gail!
-It's over, Beck.

1233
01:18:24,656 --> 01:18:26,614
Hi, sexy.

1234
01:18:26,658 --> 01:18:27,920
How 'bout that rain check?

1235
01:18:31,532 --> 01:18:32,838
Both the
hostages inside.

1236
01:18:32,882 --> 01:18:34,492
Move, move, move!

1237
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:37,321
Hands up!

1238
01:18:37,364 --> 01:18:38,191
Drop it!

1239
01:18:41,804 --> 01:18:44,763
Not another step.

1240
01:18:44,807 --> 01:18:46,330
Down on your knees, now!

1241
01:19:17,230 --> 01:19:18,841
Officer
down, officer down!

1242
01:19:20,103 --> 01:19:21,757
Check over there.

1243
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:26,587
Clear.

1244
01:19:30,287 --> 01:19:31,723
Clear.

1245
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:32,855
I
need an ambulance

1246
01:19:32,898 --> 01:19:34,421
to St. Agatha's Hospital
on Highway 27.

1247
01:19:34,465 --> 01:19:36,075
Officer down,
critical condition.

1248
01:19:36,119 --> 01:19:37,860
-I repeat, officer down.
-Mom!

1249
01:19:37,903 --> 01:19:39,557
Critical condition.

1250
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:40,427
Oh baby.

1251
01:19:41,907 --> 01:19:44,431
Oh my god, Alex.

1252
01:19:44,475 --> 01:19:47,130
Alex, hang on, baby.

1253
01:19:47,173 --> 01:19:49,610
Somebody please, someone help.

1254
01:19:51,395 --> 01:19:52,178
Hang on baby,

1255
01:19:52,222 --> 01:19:53,353
hang on baby.

1256
01:20:17,334 --> 01:20:18,291
Just relax.

1257
01:20:18,335 --> 01:20:19,858
The doctor'll be
here any minute.

1258
01:20:25,733 --> 01:20:27,213
Everything's ready, Doctor.

1259
01:20:46,711 --> 01:20:49,018
Please, please someone help me.

1260
01:20:49,061 --> 01:20:50,280
Hello, Alex.

1261
01:20:51,585 --> 01:20:54,371
No, no, no, no, no.

1262
01:20:54,414 --> 01:20:55,241
Just a tad more anesthesia.

1263
01:20:55,285 --> 01:20:56,242
Please someone help me.

1264
01:20:56,286 --> 01:20:57,156
Yes, Doctor.

1265
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:58,854
Please, please someone help me.

1266
01:21:01,204 --> 01:21:03,206
I could
never hurt you Alex.

1267
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:05,251
I'm here to save you.

1268
01:21:18,090 --> 01:21:20,092
Where is he?

1269
01:21:20,963 --> 01:21:21,702
Where is he?

1270
01:21:21,746 --> 01:21:23,356
Oh, be careful, baby.

1271
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:24,531
It's okay.

1272
01:21:24,575 --> 01:21:25,924
You're safe.

1273
01:21:25,968 --> 01:21:28,753
The surgeon, it was Beck.

1274
01:21:28,796 --> 01:21:29,623
It was him.

1275
01:21:29,667 --> 01:21:31,451
Oh no, baby.

1276
01:21:31,495 --> 01:21:32,888
No, it wasn't.

1277
01:21:32,931 --> 01:21:33,671
Mom yes, it was.

1278
01:21:33,714 --> 01:21:34,933
I saw him.

1279
01:21:34,977 --> 01:21:36,413
Alex, we've just
been through hell

1280
01:21:36,456 --> 01:21:37,936
and you're on a list of
medication that is longer than--

1281
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:40,896
No, it was him. I saw him.

1282
01:21:40,939 --> 01:21:42,680
It was Beck.

1283
01:21:42,723 --> 01:21:43,507
Shh.

1284
01:21:45,813 --> 01:21:46,814
Something wrong?

1285
01:21:46,858 --> 01:21:47,772
No, no, no.

1286
01:21:47,815 --> 01:21:49,034
The surgery was a huge success.

1287
01:21:49,078 --> 01:21:50,906
Except...

1288
01:21:50,949 --> 01:21:51,732
What?

1289
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:56,650
We just found. Dr.
Courdier in the men's room,

1290
01:21:56,694 --> 01:21:57,825
bound and unconscious.

1291
01:21:58,739 --> 01:22:00,654
He didn't perform
the transplant.

1292
01:22:00,698 --> 01:22:01,525
Someone else did.

1293
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:05,921
I told you.

1294
01:22:07,357 --> 01:22:08,401
It was Beck.

1295
01:22:10,969 --> 01:22:13,276
He saved me just like
he said he would.

1296
01:22:15,321 --> 01:22:17,454
Everything's gonna be all right.

1297
01:22:17,497 --> 01:22:18,324
He's gone now.

1298
01:22:30,684 --> 01:22:31,511
Man.

1299
01:22:37,169 --> 01:22:39,955
Yeah, like any of these guys
are gonna give you a ride.

1300
01:22:39,998 --> 01:22:40,825
Man.

1301
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,741
What the hell are
you doing here, man?

1302
01:22:43,784 --> 01:22:45,699
I got rid of you
back in the asylum.

1303
01:22:45,743 --> 01:22:48,441
I was on sabbatical.

1304
01:22:48,485 --> 01:22:49,790
I mean, let's face it, man.

1305
01:22:49,834 --> 01:22:51,096
We needed a break
from each other.

1306
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:53,664
Well, I don't need you anymore.

1307
01:22:53,707 --> 01:22:55,100
I'm cured.

1308
01:22:55,144 --> 01:22:58,538
I'd hardly call what
happened back there cured.

1309
01:23:00,105 --> 01:23:03,587
Hey, hey, hey, where ya headed?

1310
01:23:03,630 --> 01:23:05,067
Oh man.

1311
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:05,806
Here we go.

1312
01:23:11,551 --> 01:23:12,770
Hey, can I have a ride?

1313
01:23:14,902 --> 01:23:16,774
Well...sure.

1314
01:23:16,817 --> 01:23:17,644
Come on in.

1315
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:20,473
Thanks, pal.

1316
01:23:20,517 --> 01:23:22,040
I usually don't pick up hitchers

1317
01:23:22,084 --> 01:23:23,824
but you seem like
a decent fellow.

1318
01:23:23,868 --> 01:23:25,043
Thank you.

1319
01:23:26,392 --> 01:23:29,395
I got to say you're
traveling awful light.

1320
01:23:29,439 --> 01:23:31,310
Never seen a hitcher
with no baggage.

1321
01:23:31,354 --> 01:23:34,966
Oh, he's got baggage, plenty.

1322
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:36,881
I need a fresh new start.

1323
01:23:36,924 --> 01:23:39,797
New place, new clothes, new me.

1324
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:42,539
Sounds like
you got woman troubles.

1325
01:23:42,582 --> 01:23:44,323
How'd you know?

1326
01:23:44,367 --> 01:23:46,151
I've had mine too.

1327
01:23:46,195 --> 01:23:48,110
Broken hearts are a bitch.

1328
01:23:48,153 --> 01:23:49,720
Ain't they?

1329
01:23:49,763 --> 01:23:50,634
They certainly are.

1330
01:23:50,677 --> 01:23:53,550
Well, where are ya headed to?

1331
01:23:53,593 --> 01:23:54,986
Anywhere but here.

1332
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:58,076
I've been
there too, many times.

1333
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:01,036
Maybe give he can give you
a lobotomy at the next stop.

1334
01:24:02,167 --> 01:24:03,255
Shut up.

1335
01:24:03,299 --> 01:24:05,083
Well, here we go.

1336
01:24:06,476 --> 01:24:08,782
Ask him if he has a
new teenage daughters.

1337
01:24:09,827 --> 01:24:11,089
Just thinking ahead.
