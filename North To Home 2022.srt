Okay, go search, go search.

15
00:00:58,333 --> 00:00:59,533
Hey, sweetie.

16
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:02,700
Good girl, Maxie.

17
00:01:02,834 --> 00:01:03,700
Come here, baby.

18
00:01:03,834 --> 00:01:05,467
Good girl.

19
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,367
Wow, that is one talented dog.

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,967
You must have a strong scent.

21
00:01:10,433 --> 00:01:12,266
You know, when you asked me
to spend the morning with you,

22
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,600
this is not what I had in mind.

23
00:01:13,734 --> 00:01:14,967
Well, you have the
eternal gratitude

24
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,600
of the entire Kenai
Mountain Rescue Team.

25
00:01:17,734 --> 00:01:18,600
Why don't you
show your gratitude

26
00:01:18,734 --> 00:01:19,700
by having a drink with me?

27
00:01:19,834 --> 00:01:21,433
It's seven in the morning.

28
00:01:21,567 --> 00:01:22,700
I don't mean
like a drink drink.

29
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:25,200
I mean like a coffee
or a hot chocolate.

30
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:26,200
Yeah, I would love to.

31
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:27,200
Yeah?

32
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:28,433
Great, then it's a date.

33
00:01:28,567 --> 00:01:30,700
Well, I got to
get to the cafe.

34
00:01:30,834 --> 00:01:32,133
Gotta help my mom

35
00:01:32,266 --> 00:01:33,367
'cause my sisters are actually
coming in from New York

36
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,533
for my mom's birthday.

37
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:35,800
Another time then.

38
00:01:36,834 --> 00:01:38,533
I don't know.

39
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:39,767
The locals might start talking

40
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,934
if they knew that I
was dating the guy

41
00:01:41,066 --> 00:01:42,700
renting my parents' guest house.

42
00:01:42,834 --> 00:01:43,967
Dating?

43
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:44,967
I'm just talking
about getting a drink,

44
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,066
but if you want to date.

45
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,633
You excited to see your sisters?

46
00:01:48,767 --> 00:01:50,533
Yeah, I am.

47
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:52,033
It's also complicated.

48
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:54,967
You're talking
to an only child.

49
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,767
Has it always been complicated?

50
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,266
No, we were really
close when we were little,

51
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,166
but I don't know.

52
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,200
Maybe it's normal for
siblings to grow apart

53
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:04,767
as they get older.

54
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,934
It doesn't help that we live
on other sides of the country.

55
00:02:07,066 --> 00:02:08,533
So what are they like?

56
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:10,433
How to describe my sisters?

57
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:20,500
And finally, I would
suggest a line item accounting

58
00:02:20,633 --> 00:02:22,867
to ferret out any redundancies.

59
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,600
To be competitive, you're
going to need to streamline.

60
00:02:25,734 --> 00:02:26,834
That is, if you decide

61
00:02:26,967 --> 00:02:29,500
to bring your business
to Crest Financial.

62
00:02:29,633 --> 00:02:31,667
Thank you for walking
us through that, Hannah.

63
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,000
We expect to make our
decision in the next week.

64
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:35,166
Very good.

65
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,166
Just curious if
you could share more

66
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,433
of your longterm strategy?

67
00:02:38,567 --> 00:02:39,934
Well, that would
be much more complex,

68
00:02:40,066 --> 00:02:42,834
but I would be happy to work
out a more expanded analysis.

69
00:02:42,967 --> 00:02:44,266
I could get started
on that right away.

70
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,767
Well then, we'll look
forward to reading it.

71
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,133
Thank you for coming in.

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,533
Are we celebrating
a new account?

73
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:01,934
Not sure, but I think
we have a good shot.

74
00:03:02,066 --> 00:03:03,100
Still have work to do.

75
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:06,867
Where is everyone?

76
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,500
A bunch of folks cut out
early to get drinks at O'Brien's

77
00:03:08,633 --> 00:03:09,600
for Charlie's birthday.

78
00:03:09,734 --> 00:03:11,066
Oh, that reminds me, did you-

79
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,000
Checked you in for
your flight to Anchorage,

80
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:14,567
upgraded you to business class,

81
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,000
and I got a car to pick you
up when you land in Alaska.

82
00:03:17,133 --> 00:03:18,233
Great.

83
00:03:18,367 --> 00:03:19,900
Oh, and I need to get
a gift for Suzanne.

84
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,233
60's a big year, it needs
to be something special.

85
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:23,500
You're getting excited

86
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:24,667
to spend some time
with your sisters?

87
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,166
Yeah, it should be good.

88
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,266
Speaking of,
Beth called to see

89
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,667
if you're meeting at her
place or at the play.

90
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,500
The play.

91
00:03:32,633 --> 00:03:33,900
Oh.

92
00:03:34,033 --> 00:03:34,900
You want me to get
her on the phone?

93
00:03:35,033 --> 00:03:36,567
No, no, I better call her.

94
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,266
Okay then, I'll see
you when you get back.

95
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,533
Call or text anytime.

96
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:40,667
Okay, I will.

97
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:55,400
Good afternoon,
doctor's office.

98
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:56,767
Is Dr. Vogel in?

99
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,767
Who's calling, please?

100
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,266
Hannah McBride calling.

101
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,400
The line is busy,
would you like his voicemail?

102
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,900
No, no, just if you could
have him give me a ring back,

103
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:04,900
that would be great.

104
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:05,900
As soon as possible.

105
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:07,667
- You got it, bye now.
- Bye-bye.

106
00:04:15,367 --> 00:04:16,300
- She isn't!
- She is!

107
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:18,066
Girls, girls.

108
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,066
Melly.

109
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,934
Okay, just...

110
00:04:22,767 --> 00:04:24,800
Hey, Hans, can you
hold on just a sec?

111
00:04:24,934 --> 00:04:26,300
Melly, stop, please.

112
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,500
If you pull the ears like that,
you're going to rip it off.

113
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:28,500
Thank you.

114
00:04:28,633 --> 00:04:29,500
Hi, sorry.

115
00:04:29,633 --> 00:04:30,734
That doesn't sound good.

116
00:04:30,867 --> 00:04:33,333
No, they're fighting
over Bugsy again.

117
00:04:33,467 --> 00:04:34,333
Bugsy?

118
00:04:34,467 --> 00:04:35,800
Stuffed animal.

119
00:04:35,934 --> 00:04:38,400
Are you coming here or we going
to meet you at the school?

120
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,967
Listen, Beth, I hate
to do this last minute,

121
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,400
but it looks like I'm going
to have to do a rain check

122
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,567
for the play tonight.

123
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,133
No, are you serious?

124
00:04:48,266 --> 00:04:49,967
They're going to
be so disappointed.

125
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,633
Melly's the lead, but
this is Ruby's first play.

126
00:04:52,767 --> 00:04:56,133
I know, I know, but
work's been so crazy.

127
00:04:56,266 --> 00:04:57,633
I just...

128
00:04:57,767 --> 00:04:59,233
I just flew in from San
Francisco late last night

129
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:01,300
and I'm trying to land
this really big client.

130
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:03,300
This is twice you've
canceled on us this month.

131
00:05:03,433 --> 00:05:04,967
I know, I'm sorry.

132
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,867
But I'm going to
see you tomorrow.

133
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,633
Okay, I'll make it up
to the girls, I promise.

134
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,300
I'll take them for the day.

135
00:05:10,433 --> 00:05:13,467
I mean, no offense, but
they'll eat you alive.

136
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,700
Besides, I'm not
putting much stock

137
00:05:14,834 --> 00:05:16,567
in your promises these days.

138
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,667
Look, I...

139
00:05:18,867 --> 00:05:21,967
I said I was sorry, I
don't want to fight.

140
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,867
I just want to get
through this trip, okay?

141
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,233
Just can we put everything
aside for Suzanne?

142
00:05:27,367 --> 00:05:28,900
Can you not call her Suzanne?

143
00:05:30,367 --> 00:05:34,200
You do realize this birthday
is the 25th anniversary of...

144
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,467
Yeah, I know.

145
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:39,033
This time of year, it's
all I can think about.

146
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,233
Gotta go.

147
00:06:01,066 --> 00:06:02,200
How's it coming, guys?

148
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,633
We're almost there, right?

149
00:06:11,934 --> 00:06:15,033
It's so
beautiful up here.

150
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,367
Gosh, we don't get mountains
like this in upstate New York.

151
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,433
Yeah, we get a ton of
clients from back east.

152
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:20,934
They all say it's
worth the trip.

153
00:06:21,066 --> 00:06:22,767
Fabulous way to spend
your birthday, Suzanne.

154
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,767
Yeah, I got it pretty good.

155
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,767
So how long have you
guys all known each other?

156
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,700
The four of us went
to Michigan together.

157
00:06:28,834 --> 00:06:30,266
Been friends ever since.

158
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,533
Suzanne guided us on
our first ever summit

159
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:33,767
when we were sophomores.

160
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,266
Wow.

161
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,934
So you and your husband
been doing this for a while?

162
00:06:37,066 --> 00:06:38,100
Yeah.

163
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:39,100
I run people up and
down the mountain.

164
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:40,266
Stewart runs the business

165
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,600
and our indoor climbing
classes for kids.

166
00:06:42,734 --> 00:06:45,467
So, next section
gets pretty steep.

167
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,200
I'm going to need
to put you on belay.

168
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:48,967
Whatever you say, captain.

169
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,100
Looks like we have
some clouds moving in.

170
00:06:51,233 --> 00:06:52,700
There was snow up
top early this morning,

171
00:06:52,834 --> 00:06:54,200
but the forecast said
it should be clear

172
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,133
by the time we get up there.

173
00:06:58,266 --> 00:06:59,233
What was that?

174
00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:03,934
Suzanne?

175
00:07:04,066 --> 00:07:06,100
Suzanne!

176
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:10,100
Suzanne, are you okay?

177
00:07:10,233 --> 00:07:11,100
You drifted off.

178
00:07:11,233 --> 00:07:12,767
Yeah, I'm fine.

179
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,367
What's up?

180
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,767
Well, I'm headed home.

181
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,367
Gotta sort the rooms
for our special guests.

182
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,166
I'm about done
here too, I will join you.

183
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,867
Great, I'll meet you out back.

184
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,767
You're okay, right?

185
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,834
Honey, I am fine.

186
00:07:27,967 --> 00:07:29,100
Will you quit worrying about me?

187
00:07:29,233 --> 00:07:30,500
Well, I just want to make sure

188
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:32,867
that the birthday girl is happy.

189
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,100
Sweetheart, my birthday
is still a few days away.

190
00:07:36,233 --> 00:07:39,033
Please, don't rush
me out of my fifties.

191
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,500
Come on, 60 is the new 40.

192
00:07:41,633 --> 00:07:43,200
I heard 60 is the new 30.

193
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,000
Yeah, well, I wish.

194
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:47,667
Nope, 60 is still 60.

195
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,600
And you are as beautiful and
vibrant as the day I met you.

196
00:07:54,633 --> 00:07:55,500
Liar.

197
00:07:55,633 --> 00:07:56,600
It's true.

198
00:07:57,667 --> 00:07:59,166
So how was everything
today, gentlemen?

199
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,734
The service and the food was
perfect, Suzanne, as always.

200
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:04,934
Thank you.

201
00:08:05,066 --> 00:08:06,066
How about a dozen
of these cookies

202
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,333
for the Polar Bear Club?

203
00:08:07,467 --> 00:08:08,333
You got it.

204
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:09,333
Keep the change.

205
00:08:09,467 --> 00:08:10,633
Here you go.

206
00:08:10,767 --> 00:08:11,633
Be sure to say hello
to Hannah and Beth for me

207
00:08:11,767 --> 00:08:12,633
when they get in.

208
00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:14,166
We will.

209
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,600
Having you girls together is

210
00:08:15,734 --> 00:08:17,834
all she's been talking
about for months.

211
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:19,200
Oh, don't I know it.

212
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:23,500
Oh, okay.

213
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:24,900
Your dad and I are headed home.

214
00:08:25,033 --> 00:08:26,834
Still need to get
the house in order.

215
00:08:26,967 --> 00:08:28,233
Oh, and if you have time,

216
00:08:28,367 --> 00:08:29,900
the monthly invoices
still need to be balanced.

217
00:08:30,033 --> 00:08:31,433
Right, got it.

218
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:34,500
You know, there is this thing
called software, just saying.

219
00:08:34,633 --> 00:08:37,500
Yeah, well, after we retire
and you're running the cafe,

220
00:08:37,633 --> 00:08:39,834
you can do the invoices
however you want.

221
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:41,066
Until then...

222
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,000
Abacus, parchment,
paper, and quill?

223
00:08:43,133 --> 00:08:44,000
Very funny.

224
00:08:44,133 --> 00:08:45,100
Ha ha.

225
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,066
You told her to let go.

226
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,900
He was mine first.

227
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:57,266
You did give him to Ruby.

228
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,500
But I miss him,
I want him back.

229
00:08:59,633 --> 00:09:02,467
Well, sweetie, that's not
really how gift giving works.

230
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,734
We could share.

231
00:09:03,867 --> 00:09:06,800
That's a really good
idea, isn't it, Melly?

232
00:09:06,934 --> 00:09:08,567
Doesn't matter, he's ruined.

233
00:09:09,767 --> 00:09:12,066
One quick trip to
the stuffed animal vet

234
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,333
and he is good as new.

235
00:09:14,467 --> 00:09:15,467
Hmm?

236
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,133
Hey girls, this is
Mommy's old boss.

237
00:09:22,266 --> 00:09:24,066
You guys run upstairs
quick, quick, quick

238
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,633
because Daddy's going to
be here any minute, okay?

239
00:09:25,767 --> 00:09:26,934
You start getting ready.

240
00:09:30,934 --> 00:09:31,800
Hello?

241
00:09:31,934 --> 00:09:33,567
Beth, how are you?

242
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,734
I'm good.

243
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:35,734
Good.

244
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,266
Well, it's been a minute,

245
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,467
so I thought I'd check in with
my favorite former colleague.

246
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,633
Yeah, wow, it has.

247
00:09:40,767 --> 00:09:43,166
It has been a minute.

248
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,300
How, how are you?

249
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:45,567
How's the company?

250
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,300
We're both amazing.

251
00:09:47,433 --> 00:09:48,900
Both very busy.

252
00:09:49,033 --> 00:09:51,734
Beth, does the name Anna
Bellingham ring a bell?

253
00:09:51,867 --> 00:09:54,900
Yeah, she's the CEO
of Regal Beauty, right?

254
00:09:55,033 --> 00:09:56,633
Well, we just got out
of a meeting with her

255
00:09:56,767 --> 00:09:59,000
and we were discussing
marketing their new beauty line.

256
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:00,000
That's huge.

257
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:01,633
Congratulations.

258
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,967
It's a little early
for congratulations,

259
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,133
which is where you come in.

260
00:10:06,266 --> 00:10:07,467
Okay.

261
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,934
I thought to myself,

262
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:12,166
who would be the perfect
point person for this account?

263
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,633
The great Beth McBride.

264
00:10:14,767 --> 00:10:15,800
Yeah.

265
00:10:15,934 --> 00:10:17,400
Maybe in my former life.

266
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,066
Which makes you
perfect for this.

267
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,066
Their target demo is moms
in the workforce or at home

268
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,300
who want to look their best

269
00:10:23,433 --> 00:10:24,834
but don't have the
luxury of time.

270
00:10:24,967 --> 00:10:26,900
I'm flattered, I am.

271
00:10:27,033 --> 00:10:30,967
But I just, I have a lot on
my plate with the family, so.

272
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,066
Don't you ever think
about getting back to work?

273
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,734
Wait, are you
offering me a job?

274
00:10:36,867 --> 00:10:37,967
That's the plan.

275
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,667
But first Anna wants
to see a strategy

276
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,567
on how we would reel
in our target market.

277
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,567
I...

278
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,133
Thank you, but now's not great.

279
00:10:46,266 --> 00:10:47,166
Mull it over.

280
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,467
I'll touch base in a day or two

281
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,333
and you can give me
your answer then.

282
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,967
Okay, yeah, I'll
think about it.

283
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,967
Deal.

284
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,567
Thanks, Corinna.

285
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,233
I'm home!

286
00:11:02,367 --> 00:11:04,133
Daddy, Daddy!

287
00:11:04,266 --> 00:11:05,133
Hi, hi.

288
00:11:05,266 --> 00:11:06,133
Get in here.

289
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:09,033
Oh, wow, look at you.

290
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:10,300
Okay, what's happening?

291
00:11:10,433 --> 00:11:11,967
Melly broke Bugsy.

292
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,233
I did not.

293
00:11:13,367 --> 00:11:14,633
Oh no.

294
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,867
But looks like
she's in good hands.

295
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,734
- Can I have one?
- Me too.

296
00:11:20,867 --> 00:11:21,967
Oh, okay.

297
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,734
Those are supposed to
be for after the show.

298
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:26,300
Sorry.

299
00:11:26,433 --> 00:11:27,967
But at least I don't have to
talk to you about cavities.

300
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,066
Do I?

301
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,367
Sorry.

302
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,200
So, how was your day?

303
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,800
Well, it was interesting.

304
00:11:38,934 --> 00:11:40,066
Care to elaborate?

305
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,133
Later.

306
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:42,533
All right.

307
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:45,567
So, who wants to
go to the theater?

308
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,567
- Me!
- Me!

309
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,900
All right, let's go, let's go.

310
00:11:48,033 --> 00:11:49,233
Hand, hand, hand.

311
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:50,233
Who's driving?

312
00:11:50,367 --> 00:11:51,233
You driving?

313
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:52,333
Okay.

314
00:11:57,266 --> 00:12:00,100
Hey, should I
bring this scarf?

315
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:01,600
Hannah?

316
00:12:01,734 --> 00:12:02,600
Hannah?

317
00:12:02,734 --> 00:12:04,266
Yes, yeah, sorry.

318
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,533
Yes?

319
00:12:05,667 --> 00:12:06,700
Scarf, should I
bring the scarf?

320
00:12:06,834 --> 00:12:07,700
Sure.

321
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:08,800
Yeah.

322
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:10,734
The scarf.

323
00:12:10,867 --> 00:12:11,834
Everything all right?

324
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,367
It's just, you know,

325
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,934
this trip couldn't have
come at a worse time, right?

326
00:12:16,066 --> 00:12:17,633
I think that I bit off
more than I could chew

327
00:12:17,767 --> 00:12:19,133
with this account.

328
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,533
Anything else?

329
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:24,033
It's just I know

330
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:26,767
that being with family can
sometimes be stressful.

331
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,100
Well, there is that.

332
00:12:28,233 --> 00:12:30,867
And Beth is mad at me.

333
00:12:32,233 --> 00:12:33,100
Again?

334
00:12:33,233 --> 00:12:34,200
Yeah.

335
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,533
Well, look, it's
only for a few days,

336
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:40,567
so why don't we try and
make the best of it?

337
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,467
Promise?

338
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,567
I promise.

339
00:12:44,834 --> 00:12:46,633
As long as you promise
not to take the bait

340
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:48,867
and get in another chess
battle with my dad.

341
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,300
Trust me, I'm not
falling for that again.

342
00:12:50,433 --> 00:12:51,934
The man is a shark.

343
00:12:52,066 --> 00:12:53,033
Oh.

344
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,600
Whoa, you okay?

345
00:12:54,734 --> 00:12:55,600
You look a little pale.

346
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:56,600
No, I'm fine.

347
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:57,700
I just skipped lunch.

348
00:12:57,834 --> 00:13:00,700
I'm going to pack, or repack.

349
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:07,266
What'd you want
to talk to me about?

350
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,266
I know that it's
not the best timing,

351
00:13:10,467 --> 00:13:12,767
but with the girls
getting older,

352
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,333
I think I'm ready
to take on more.

353
00:13:15,467 --> 00:13:18,667
And I know this is something
that we've talked about before,

354
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,767
but I've been thinking
a lot about it recently

355
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,433
and it just, I feel like...

356
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:24,600
Wow.

357
00:13:24,734 --> 00:13:25,667
I was not expecting this.

358
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,266
I know the timing's not great.

359
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,100
Oh, the timing
is never perfect.

360
00:13:29,233 --> 00:13:30,533
I think it's a great idea.

361
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:32,433
Oh, really?

362
00:13:32,567 --> 00:13:34,867
Yes, yes, we can adapt.

363
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,266
Remember when we were
planning to have Ruby,

364
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,767
we thought two kids
would do us in.

365
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,867
You don't think the
girls are going to feel

366
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,867
like they're not enough?

367
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,934
I don't want them
to feel that way.

368
00:13:41,066 --> 00:13:42,266
Are you kidding?

369
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,500
They're going to be thrilled

370
00:13:43,633 --> 00:13:44,934
to have a younger
sister, or brother.

371
00:13:49,633 --> 00:13:51,867
Um...

372
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,433
We're not talking
about the same thing.

373
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:54,867
No, we're not.

374
00:13:56,066 --> 00:13:57,667
We're not talking about
the same thing, sorry.

375
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,767
I...

376
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,934
Corinna reached out to me.

377
00:14:02,066 --> 00:14:05,433
As in formerly the bane
of your existence Corinna?

378
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,433
She wants me to
be the point person.

379
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,767
And this is an
amazing opportunity.

380
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,934
Okay.

381
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:15,567
And work was a
huge part of my life.

382
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,000
It was.

383
00:14:17,133 --> 00:14:20,333
And with Ruby going to
preschool, I have more time.

384
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:27,900
Okay, but when we had kids,
you wanted to stay home.

385
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:32,400
What made you change your mind?

386
00:14:32,533 --> 00:14:34,567
I...

387
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,066
I just feel like you're the,

388
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,066
you know, you get to go to work

389
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,767
and you get to do what you love.

390
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,900
and then you come home, you
get the best part of them.

391
00:14:42,033 --> 00:14:44,900
You get to be the fun
dad, and I'm just this,

392
00:14:45,033 --> 00:14:46,834
the person that says
no all the time.

393
00:14:47,867 --> 00:14:49,066
I need balance.

394
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,767
Mom!

395
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,800
Stop it!

396
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:52,900
Wait, hang on, let's
finish this conversation.

397
00:14:53,033 --> 00:14:53,900
I can't.

398
00:14:54,033 --> 00:14:55,233
I gotta break up a fight

399
00:14:55,367 --> 00:14:57,000
and then I gotta sew an ear
back on a stuffed animal.

400
00:14:57,133 --> 00:14:58,567
So just...

401
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,066
Maybe you're just burnt out.

402
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,500
What if tomorrow
you head back home

403
00:15:03,633 --> 00:15:06,066
and the girls and I
will stay back a day?

404
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,767
Give you, I don't
know, a little break?

405
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,834
That would be nice.

406
00:15:13,967 --> 00:15:18,166
Hey, girls, girls, girls.

407
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,066
Flight 662 to Chicago,

408
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,066
urging passengers to
proceed to gate B14

409
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,300
for immediate boarding.

410
00:15:24,433 --> 00:15:25,900
Can I bring either of
you something to drink

411
00:15:26,033 --> 00:15:26,900
before your flight?

412
00:15:27,033 --> 00:15:28,400
Oh, champagne?

413
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:30,734
I'll just have some
water, bit of a headache.

414
00:15:30,867 --> 00:15:32,066
Thank you.

415
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,166
Make that two.

416
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,400
Hey, we've got a long flight.

417
00:15:36,533 --> 00:15:38,467
Maybe see if you can
catch up on some sleep.

418
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,967
Good idea.

419
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,800
Fingers crossed we won't
encounter any screaming kids.

420
00:15:42,934 --> 00:15:45,600
Got my eye on a potential
troublemaker over there.

421
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,467
Speaking of which, are you
prepared to talk babies

422
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,967
when your mom inevitably
brings up the subject,

423
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,166
she wants grandkids?

424
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,400
You know, she
has Melly and Ruby

425
00:15:53,533 --> 00:15:55,467
and who knows, one
of these days Posy.

426
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,133
It's not that
uncommon for couples

427
00:15:57,266 --> 00:15:58,734
to decide not to have kids.

428
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:08,467
Ladies and
gentlemen, flight 783

429
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,800
to Anchorage, Alaska will begin
pre-boarding in 10 minutes.

430
00:16:11,934 --> 00:16:13,800
Please make your
way to the gate.

431
00:16:13,934 --> 00:16:14,900
I'll get those waters to go.

432
00:16:15,033 --> 00:16:16,000
Thanks.

433
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,700
This is Dr.
Vogel returning your call.

434
00:16:22,834 --> 00:16:24,133
I have your test results.

435
00:16:24,266 --> 00:16:25,633
Please give me a call back.

436
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:52,800
Hannah, I had another bad
dream, can you read to me?

437
00:16:52,934 --> 00:16:53,867
Sure.

438
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,967
Come on.

439
00:17:02,734 --> 00:17:05,700
"It was a bright
and sunny morning

440
00:17:05,834 --> 00:17:08,133
"and the window
stood wide open."

441
00:17:08,266 --> 00:17:09,300
I'm trying to sleep.

442
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,266
Can we start at the beginning?

443
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,600
Posy, if we keep
starting at the beginning,

444
00:17:25,734 --> 00:17:27,300
we'll never get to the end.

445
00:17:28,834 --> 00:17:34,367
Mom and Dad would start over
as many times as we wanted.

446
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,367
I wish they were here.

447
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,133
Me too.

448
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,266
Okay.

449
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,266
"There once was a
velveteen rabbit

450
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,066
"and in the beginning
he was really splendid.

451
00:17:52,266 --> 00:18:02,300
"He was fat and punchy
as a rabbit should be."

452
00:18:04,367 --> 00:18:06,233
Hey, sorry.

453
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,100
Hey, sis, welcome home!

454
00:18:14,233 --> 00:18:16,400
Thank you.

455
00:18:16,533 --> 00:18:17,567
Hey!

456
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,567
Jason, the kids,
getting their bags?

457
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,934
Nope, just me flying solo.

458
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:20,934
Wait, what?

459
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:22,667
They'll be here tomorrow.

460
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,266
I'm so confused, why
didn't you say anything?

461
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,233
I didn't want you to worry.

462
00:18:26,367 --> 00:18:29,333
You know, kind of like
you're doing right now.

463
00:18:29,467 --> 00:18:30,333
I'm not worried.

464
00:18:30,467 --> 00:18:31,767
You know, it's just different.

465
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,100
Well, Jason thought I
could use some quality time

466
00:18:34,233 --> 00:18:37,734
with my sisters, so he's
giving me some space.

467
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,000
Details, please.

468
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:43,834
Can we just talk
about something else?

469
00:18:43,967 --> 00:18:46,266
Lots of women are
mothers and have careers.

470
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,500
Well, yeah.

471
00:18:47,633 --> 00:18:48,734
It's not selfish
of me to want more.

472
00:18:48,867 --> 00:18:50,066
Did he say you
were being selfish?

473
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,834
No, he just can't
understand why now.

474
00:18:51,967 --> 00:18:54,000
I mean, I love being
a mother and a wife.

475
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,100
I just, I want more.

476
00:18:57,233 --> 00:18:58,433
Yeah, okay.

477
00:18:58,567 --> 00:18:59,934
That's great.

478
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:04,800
But yeah, why now?

479
00:19:04,934 --> 00:19:06,667
Talking to Corinna
woke something up in me.

480
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,000
I mean, I miss being out
there with adults, you know,

481
00:19:11,133 --> 00:19:12,633
doing something that I'm good at

482
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:17,233
that doesn't involve
cleaning or making lunches.

483
00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:18,934
I miss the hustle.

484
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,667
And let's be honest, I mean,

485
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,967
the girls are gonna
grow up, right?

486
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:23,967
And they're going to
be out of the house

487
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,467
and then who's going to hire me?

488
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,066
I mean, an 18 year gap tends
to stick out on a resume.

489
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,567
I mean, I'd be un-hireable.

490
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,066
I think you're getting
ahead of yourself here.

491
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,500
And in Jason's defense,
change is hard.

492
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:38,400
Maybe he just likes
things the way they are.

493
00:19:38,533 --> 00:19:39,900
Yeah, but he didn't
seem to have a problem

494
00:19:40,033 --> 00:19:41,066
when he thought it was
about having another baby.

495
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,300
He said "We'll
adjust, you know."

496
00:19:42,433 --> 00:19:43,500
Wait, you want another baby?

497
00:19:43,633 --> 00:19:45,066
No, that's not about
having another baby.

498
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,066
Oh, because you
mentioned a baby.

499
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,100
No.

500
00:19:47,233 --> 00:19:48,233
Wait, are we having one

501
00:19:48,367 --> 00:19:49,734
of those I should just
listen conversations

502
00:19:49,867 --> 00:19:52,333
or you want my
help conversations?

503
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:55,333
Both.

504
00:19:55,467 --> 00:19:56,500
Okay.

505
00:19:58,033 --> 00:20:01,333
Well, to be honest,
I'm pretty surprised

506
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:03,233
that you're even thinking about
working with Corinna again.

507
00:20:03,367 --> 00:20:05,166
I mean, you couldn't get
away from her fast enough.

508
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,567
People change.

509
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,000
Everybody gets to do
what they want in life.

510
00:20:09,133 --> 00:20:10,633
I mean, you get to spend
time in the mountains

511
00:20:10,767 --> 00:20:12,133
and you'll have the cafe.

512
00:20:12,266 --> 00:20:16,133
And Hannah, you know, she
leads her jet-setting life.

513
00:20:16,266 --> 00:20:17,567
And then there's me.

514
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,567
You shouldn't compare
yourself to others, you know.

515
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,100
Things aren't always
as simple as they seem.

516
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,166
I'm just...

517
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,567
I'm happy to be home.

518
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,800
I'm excited to see Mom and Dad.

519
00:20:30,934 --> 00:20:33,000
They are so happy you're here.

520
00:20:37,533 --> 00:20:41,967
Does she ever talk
about it, the accident?

521
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,233
No.

522
00:20:44,367 --> 00:20:45,967
Talking about the accident is...

523
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,333
It's not really our
family's strong suit.

524
00:20:49,867 --> 00:20:50,967
What an awful thing

525
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,233
to be reminded of
every single birthday.

526
00:20:56,767 --> 00:20:58,633
I think this is the
first time in five years

527
00:20:58,767 --> 00:21:02,200
that you, me, and Hannah have
been home at the same time.

528
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,900
Should be interesting.

529
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:08,400
Really interesting.

530
00:21:15,266 --> 00:21:17,033
Oh, there they are!

531
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,700
Welcome home, honey.

532
00:21:18,834 --> 00:21:22,867
Oh, oh, sweetheart.
- Good to see you.

533
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,400
Good to see you.

534
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,400
Hello, kid.

535
00:21:25,533 --> 00:21:26,500
Dad.

536
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:31,066
Oh, I'm so happy to be home.

537
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,567
We've been counting the days.

538
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,800
Yeah.

539
00:21:33,934 --> 00:21:35,533
Wait, where's
Jason, the girls?

540
00:21:35,667 --> 00:21:37,200
Oh, slight change of plans.

541
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,467
They'll be coming tomorrow.

542
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,467
Oh, well, we'll just
get your bags inside.

543
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,300
We set up your old room for you.

544
00:21:42,433 --> 00:21:43,467
Thanks, Dad.

545
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,467
So you must be exhausted.

546
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,734
Do you need a hot
shower or a warm cookie?

547
00:21:48,867 --> 00:21:49,734
Both.

548
00:21:49,867 --> 00:21:51,066
That's my girl.

549
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,200
Posy, can you show your
sister to her room?

550
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,133
I think she knows
which room, Mom.

551
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,900
This brings me back.

552
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,200
Did I ever tell you how
much I miss your cooking?

553
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:04,867
Well, I miss
cooking for you more.

554
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,433
You spoil us.

555
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:09,367
Sometimes I get jealous that
Posy gets to live next door.

556
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,033
Seriously, I wish I was
half the cook you were.

557
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:13,934
I think Jason and the
girls definitely agree.

558
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:14,967
Oh, come on.

559
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,133
I'm sure you're great.

560
00:22:16,266 --> 00:22:17,367
No.

561
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,867
Well, all it
takes is practice.

562
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,033
Posy here used to want
nothing to do with baking

563
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:23,300
and she's turning
into a real pro.

564
00:22:23,433 --> 00:22:25,100
Oh.

565
00:22:25,233 --> 00:22:26,533
That's quite a casserole.

566
00:22:26,667 --> 00:22:27,767
Yeah.

567
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,967
Well, Hannah and Adam
will be here soon

568
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,600
and I wanted to take
some to Luke too.

569
00:22:31,734 --> 00:22:33,033
Who's Luke?

570
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:34,633
He's been renting the guest
house the past few weeks.

571
00:22:34,767 --> 00:22:36,300
He's a travel writer.

572
00:22:36,433 --> 00:22:37,633
Oh, speak of the devil.

573
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,600
Hey.

574
00:22:41,734 --> 00:22:44,367
Okay.

575
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,867
You didn't want to tell me

576
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,433
that there was a cute writer
living on the property?

577
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:49,433
It never occurred to me.

578
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:50,800
Uh huh.

579
00:22:50,934 --> 00:22:54,033
And he is a very
nice young man.

580
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:56,300
In fact, he is
writing a travel guide

581
00:22:56,433 --> 00:22:57,867
about the great peaks
of North America.

582
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,967
All of which I hope
to summit one day.

583
00:23:01,467 --> 00:23:02,834
Actually, Mom,

584
00:23:02,967 --> 00:23:06,333
why don't you let Posy and
I run this over to him?

585
00:23:06,467 --> 00:23:08,266
- Yeah.
- I would like to meet Luke.

586
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,600
You think this is funny.

587
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,667
What a nice surprise.

588
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,767
I hope we're
not bothering you.

589
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,033
You're not bothering me.

590
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:28,266
Mom whipped up one
of her specialties.

591
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,266
Have you eaten?

592
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,367
No.

593
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,033
Oh, this is my
nosy sister, Beth.

594
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:35,433
I've heard a lot about you.

595
00:23:35,567 --> 00:23:38,166
New Jersey, married, two kids.

596
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,100
That about sums it up.

597
00:23:40,233 --> 00:23:42,133
I have heard a
lot about you too.

598
00:23:42,266 --> 00:23:43,133
Really?

599
00:23:43,266 --> 00:23:44,133
Yeah, Mom filled her in.

600
00:23:44,266 --> 00:23:45,600
Oh.

601
00:23:45,734 --> 00:23:46,600
You guys want to come in?

602
00:23:46,734 --> 00:23:47,600
We would love to.

603
00:23:47,734 --> 00:23:48,834
Except that we can't

604
00:23:48,967 --> 00:23:50,300
because our other sister
is arriving any second.

605
00:23:50,433 --> 00:23:51,333
That'd be Hannah, right?

606
00:23:51,467 --> 00:23:53,166
- Yeah.
- That's right.

607
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:56,333
So how long will you be in town?

608
00:23:56,467 --> 00:23:58,333
I'm not really sure.

609
00:23:58,467 --> 00:24:00,233
I've got a few climbs I
want to get under my belt

610
00:24:00,367 --> 00:24:02,066
and a few sights I'd like to see

611
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,934
before I head back
home to Chicago.

612
00:24:05,467 --> 00:24:07,567
He should come to the
Lumberjack Games with us.

613
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,000
We're going to the
Lumberjack Games?

614
00:24:09,133 --> 00:24:11,233
Yeah, it's a family tradition.

615
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:13,433
Okay, well, I'm sure
Luke has work to do.

616
00:24:13,567 --> 00:24:15,400
Actually, one thing you
should know about writers is

617
00:24:15,533 --> 00:24:18,166
we do just about anything
to avoid writing.

618
00:24:20,033 --> 00:24:22,100
Well, it's a plan.

619
00:24:22,233 --> 00:24:24,333
All right, I
look forward to it.

620
00:24:24,467 --> 00:24:25,667
Tell your mom
thanks for the food.

621
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,066
I will.

622
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,200
Bye, Luke.

623
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,600
Family tradition?

624
00:24:31,734 --> 00:24:33,667
Okay, I might've
gotten carried away,

625
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,834
but I feel bad,
he's all by himself.

626
00:24:35,967 --> 00:24:38,166
You're just like Mom,
always playing matchmaker.

627
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,400
Posy!

628
00:24:39,533 --> 00:24:40,567
- Hey!
- Hey!

629
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,700
Hi!

630
00:24:43,867 --> 00:24:45,166
So good to see you.

631
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,233
Hey.

632
00:24:46,367 --> 00:24:47,367
Beth.

633
00:24:48,967 --> 00:24:50,000
How was the flight?

634
00:24:50,133 --> 00:24:51,166
Oh, it was great.

635
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,567
Except for the kid that
was kicking my seat.

636
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,667
Oh, it wasn't that bad.

637
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,400
He was just being a typical kid.

638
00:24:56,533 --> 00:24:58,567
Here's
the weary travelers!

639
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,400
Oh, you made it!

640
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:02,400
I'm so glad to see you.

641
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:05,233
Hey, Adam, welcome.
- Welcome home.

642
00:25:05,367 --> 00:25:07,233
Okay, let's get inside

643
00:25:07,367 --> 00:25:08,433
and we are going to
go make some tea.

644
00:25:08,567 --> 00:25:09,567
Come on, girls.

645
00:25:10,867 --> 00:25:12,233
You have anything stronger?

646
00:25:12,367 --> 00:25:15,400
I may have a single malt
scotch around here somewhere.

647
00:25:15,533 --> 00:25:16,500
Follow me.

648
00:25:18,867 --> 00:25:20,000
These are delicious.

649
00:25:20,133 --> 00:25:21,834
I am definitely quitting
my diet while I'm here.

650
00:25:21,967 --> 00:25:22,967
Mom, I love your food.

651
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,400
Mom, sit down, relax.

652
00:25:25,533 --> 00:25:28,900
Oh, it's just so good to
have all my girls here again.

653
00:25:29,033 --> 00:25:31,233
It's a miracle we could do
it with your busy schedules.

654
00:25:31,367 --> 00:25:34,467
Did you really think we'd
miss your 60th birthday?

655
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,633
Okay, note to everyone.

656
00:25:36,767 --> 00:25:39,233
No need to keep
reiterating it's my 60th.

657
00:25:39,367 --> 00:25:41,166
Just say plain old birthday.

658
00:25:42,433 --> 00:25:43,800
How are things at the cafe?

659
00:25:43,934 --> 00:25:46,567
Oh, Posy here has just
really taken over the reins.

660
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,800
She's a natural.

661
00:25:47,934 --> 00:25:49,400
It's almost like Stewart
and I don't even need

662
00:25:49,533 --> 00:25:50,567
to be there anymore.

663
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,233
It gives us such
peace of mind knowing

664
00:25:52,367 --> 00:25:55,900
that it is going to be in
safe hands when we retire.

665
00:25:56,033 --> 00:25:57,967
Well, speaking of retiring,

666
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:58,967
I think I'm going to go to bed.

667
00:25:59,100 --> 00:25:59,967
No?

668
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:01,300
Yeah, me too.

669
00:26:01,433 --> 00:26:03,367
I'll be up just as soon
as I beat your dad here.

670
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,066
I have him cornered.

671
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,400
Checkmate.

672
00:26:12,533 --> 00:26:14,133
- Seriously?
- Every time.

673
00:26:14,266 --> 00:26:15,133
Don't be too hard on yourself.

674
00:26:15,266 --> 00:26:16,367
You've had a long flight.

675
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,233
We'll play again when
you're not so tired.

676
00:26:18,367 --> 00:26:19,300
Dad, you're making it worse.

677
00:26:19,433 --> 00:26:20,800
Well, I...

678
00:26:20,934 --> 00:26:21,800
Next time, sweetie.

679
00:26:21,934 --> 00:26:23,200
Let's go.

680
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:24,633
Live to fight another day.

681
00:26:24,767 --> 00:26:26,033
- Yeah, good night.
- See everybody tomorrow.

682
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:27,333
- Night.
- Nighty night.

683
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,533
You know, I think I
will turn in as well.

684
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:34,033
I'm going to give Jason
and the kids a call

685
00:26:34,166 --> 00:26:35,467
before I read a book

686
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,700
and drift off to a peaceful
uninterrupted slumber.

687
00:26:39,834 --> 00:26:40,867
I'll help you up.

688
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,967
I'm fine.

689
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,367
Sure, yeah.

690
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,033
That'd be great.

691
00:26:47,166 --> 00:26:49,200
- Night, Mom, Dad.
- Night, girls.

692
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:50,900
Good night, girls.

693
00:26:51,033 --> 00:26:53,066
Just the thought of
working at the cafe

694
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,567
for the rest of my life
scares me to death.

695
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,233
I want to travel,
I want adventure.

696
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,734
I want to climb new peaks.

697
00:26:59,867 --> 00:27:02,600
I know, but it's beautiful
here and the people are nice.

698
00:27:02,734 --> 00:27:05,367
And Mom and Dad have
done so much for us.

699
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,734
I mean, it's their dream to
keep the cafe in the family.

700
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,767
What is this?

701
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,600
I don't think I've
ever seen this before.

702
00:27:21,734 --> 00:27:22,767
Me either.

703
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,300
I can't believe we
still have a VHS player.

704
00:27:27,834 --> 00:27:33,433
It must've been Hannah's.

705
00:27:33,567 --> 00:27:35,767
I think that about does it.

706
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,800
Let's go.

707
00:27:36,934 --> 00:27:37,900
Girls.

708
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:40,767
What do you think, girls?

709
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,867
You excited?

710
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,266
Your first overnight
hiking trip.

711
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,800
Isn't it gonna be freezing?

712
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,200
I'm starving.

713
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:52,800
I need to go to the bathroom.

714
00:27:52,934 --> 00:27:56,633
As you can tell,
they're all very excited.

715
00:27:56,767 --> 00:27:58,867
Mom sure was beautiful.

716
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,166
Yeah.

717
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,166
She sure was.

718
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,033
No colds, no one gets
colds on this trip.

719
00:28:07,233 --> 00:28:10,000
The same age
as Melly and Ruby now.

720
00:28:10,133 --> 00:28:11,100
Yeah.

721
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:17,000
Sometimes I do wonder how
different life would be

722
00:28:17,133 --> 00:28:18,934
if Mom and Dad were alive.

723
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,600
Me too.

724
00:28:24,734 --> 00:28:26,433
I also think about what
it would've been like

725
00:28:26,567 --> 00:28:28,767
if Suzanne and Stewart
hadn't taken us in.

726
00:28:33,166 --> 00:28:35,367
Yeah.

727
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:57,066
So much
for sleeping in.

728
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,133
Sorry, I know
it's early for you,

729
00:28:59,266 --> 00:29:01,300
but I'm just dying
to get your answer.

730
00:29:01,433 --> 00:29:02,400
Corinna.

731
00:29:04,166 --> 00:29:05,533
Jason and I talked

732
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:09,066
and we just don't think
it's the right time for us.

733
00:29:10,734 --> 00:29:12,934
I think that's
a mistake, Beth.

734
00:29:13,066 --> 00:29:14,967
This is a golden opportunity.

735
00:29:16,233 --> 00:29:19,266
Believe me, I know,

736
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:24,033
but I'm going to have to pass.

737
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:28,300
I appreciate you thinking
of me for this though.

738
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:34,433
Good morning.

739
00:29:34,567 --> 00:29:36,600
Hey, there's coffee
if you want some.

740
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:38,033
Where is everyone?

741
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:39,600
Oh, Mom and Dad
are at the cafe,

742
00:29:39,734 --> 00:29:42,233
Adam went into town, and
not sure where Hannah is.

743
00:29:42,367 --> 00:29:43,367
Funny.

744
00:29:44,567 --> 00:29:46,867
So what's on the
agenda for today?

745
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,133
I'm actually going
to go into town too.

746
00:29:48,266 --> 00:29:49,333
I wanted to get a few
extra little things

747
00:29:49,467 --> 00:29:50,333
for Mom's birthday.

748
00:29:50,467 --> 00:29:51,367
You want to join?

749
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,367
Sure.

750
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,467
I'd love to.

751
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,133
- Great.
- Hannah, you want to come?

752
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,533
I would really love to,

753
00:29:57,667 --> 00:29:59,033
but I have to get
through this proposal.

754
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:00,934
I'll catch up with
you guys later.

755
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:01,934
And miss a day out
with your sisters?

756
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:02,934
Don't make me feel bad.

757
00:30:03,066 --> 00:30:04,033
I didn't say anything.

758
00:30:04,166 --> 00:30:05,600
You don't have to.

759
00:30:05,734 --> 00:30:07,100
So just you and me then.

760
00:30:07,233 --> 00:30:08,266
Yeah, guess so.

761
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,033
Have fun.

762
00:30:10,166 --> 00:30:12,633
We will.

763
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:23,467
Hey, Beth, how about this?

764
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,367
No.

765
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,600
Pretty sure she would hate that.

766
00:30:28,734 --> 00:30:29,700
Oh well.

767
00:30:31,233 --> 00:30:32,100
Luke!

768
00:30:32,233 --> 00:30:33,133
Hi.

769
00:30:33,266 --> 00:30:34,767
Posy, look, it's Luke.

770
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,266
Yeah, I can see that.

771
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,533
I saw you guys through the
window, I wanted to say hi.

772
00:30:38,667 --> 00:30:39,600
What are you up to?

773
00:30:39,734 --> 00:30:40,867
Oh, we're trying to find
a little extra something

774
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,934
for Mom's birthday.

775
00:30:42,066 --> 00:30:43,200
How about you?

776
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:44,600
I was going to go to Keystone
Canyon, get some climbs in.

777
00:30:44,734 --> 00:30:46,300
I hear there's some beautiful
waterfalls up there.

778
00:30:46,433 --> 00:30:49,367
Oh yeah, some of my favorite
routes are up that way.

779
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,700
Why don't you guys come?

780
00:30:50,834 --> 00:30:55,300
Oh, that's more Posy's domain.

781
00:30:55,433 --> 00:30:56,600
You should go.

782
00:30:56,734 --> 00:30:57,767
Oh, we just got here.

783
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,767
Yeah.

784
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,266
Go, I can keep looking.

785
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,667
And leave you all alone?

786
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,166
Oh, you say that
like it's a bad thing.

787
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,700
Jason arrives with
the kids today,

788
00:31:05,834 --> 00:31:09,600
so this might be the only,
you know, me time I get.

789
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:11,767
What do you say?

790
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,367
Yeah, yeah, I'd love to.

791
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,500
Great.

792
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:18,767
Bye, Beth.
- Bye, Beth.

793
00:31:24,667 --> 00:31:25,667
This is beautiful.

794
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,200
Yeah, this is home.

795
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:30,867
Aren't you so lucky you got
Denali right in your backyard?

796
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,667
Yeah, but you get to
climb all over the world.

797
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,934
What's been your
favorite so far?

798
00:31:35,066 --> 00:31:36,100
Matterhorn.

799
00:31:36,233 --> 00:31:37,333
I mean, it's not the tallest,

800
00:31:37,467 --> 00:31:38,834
but it's definitely a challenge.

801
00:31:38,967 --> 00:31:40,767
Yeah, man, I would love
to climb in Switzerland

802
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,500
or, gosh, anywhere in Europe.

803
00:31:42,633 --> 00:31:45,333
Well, someone of your
skills, you definitely should.

804
00:31:45,467 --> 00:31:47,533
Yeah, I was thinking about
going back there this summer.

805
00:31:47,667 --> 00:31:51,600
Could use a companion,
like a climbing companion.

806
00:31:51,734 --> 00:31:54,300
Oh, I'd love to, but work.

807
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,400
I mean, your parents
would understand

808
00:32:04,533 --> 00:32:06,066
a little climbing excursion.

809
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,567
My dad maybe, but my mom,

810
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,266
I think she'd rather
I took up something

811
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,834
a little less dangerous,
like scrapbooking.

812
00:32:12,967 --> 00:32:14,900
Over-protective, huh?

813
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:16,000
Yeah.

814
00:32:16,133 --> 00:32:17,166
But I can understand.

815
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:22,233
My birth parents and
one other couple,

816
00:32:22,367 --> 00:32:26,333
they were killed in an
avalanche on Denali years ago.

817
00:32:27,367 --> 00:32:31,066
I was four years
old at the time.

818
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,600
Sorry, Posy.

819
00:32:32,734 --> 00:32:34,934
That's an impossible
situation to deal with.

820
00:32:36,367 --> 00:32:42,900
We're still dealing with
it, each in our own way.

821
00:32:43,033 --> 00:32:44,500
Posy, I...

822
00:32:44,633 --> 00:32:46,400
Oh gosh, I don't
mean to bring you down.

823
00:32:46,533 --> 00:32:48,667
No, what I want to say-

824
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,000
Oh, you don't have to
say anything, really.

825
00:32:50,133 --> 00:32:51,233
It's a lot to lay on someone.

826
00:32:51,367 --> 00:32:53,600
Most people don't know
how to react, it's fine.

827
00:32:53,734 --> 00:32:55,600
We came here to hike,
let's get to it.

828
00:33:03,934 --> 00:33:05,467
Well, I think they
are great together.

829
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,133
Well, they do have
a lot in common.

830
00:33:08,266 --> 00:33:10,333
I say we stay out
of her business.

831
00:33:10,467 --> 00:33:11,567
Oh, come on.

832
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,567
You guys realize I'm
standing right here?

833
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,633
And I agree with Hannah.

834
00:33:14,767 --> 00:33:15,834
Thank you.

835
00:33:15,967 --> 00:33:17,633
We just want you
to be happy, honey.

836
00:33:17,767 --> 00:33:18,834
Grandma, we made it!

837
00:33:18,967 --> 00:33:20,667
Oh, there's my
two favorite girls!

838
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,066
I missed you guys.

839
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,500
My turn.

840
00:33:24,633 --> 00:33:25,500
Auntie Posy!

841
00:33:25,633 --> 00:33:26,967
We almost missed our plane.

842
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,233
Well, I'm glad you didn't
because I missed you.

843
00:33:30,367 --> 00:33:31,333
Come here.

844
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:34,233
- Mommy!
- Where is your Daddy?

845
00:33:36,533 --> 00:33:37,767
Freezing out there.

846
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:38,767
Oh.

847
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,900
Wow.

848
00:33:41,133 --> 00:33:42,133
I kind of didn't
know what to pack,

849
00:33:42,266 --> 00:33:43,667
so I kind of packed everything.

850
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,500
Yeah, good man.

851
00:33:45,633 --> 00:33:47,834
So, who is hungry?

852
00:33:47,967 --> 00:33:49,500
We had pretzels, two cookies,

853
00:33:49,633 --> 00:33:50,800
and a candy bar on the plane.

854
00:33:50,934 --> 00:33:52,333
Traitor.

855
00:33:52,467 --> 00:33:53,900
Well, let's get
your coats off at least.

856
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:54,900
Come on.

857
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,233
I'm glad you're here.

858
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,333
Me too.

859
00:33:57,467 --> 00:33:58,800
How was your flight?

860
00:33:58,934 --> 00:34:00,867
Well, we were a little slow
getting out of the house,

861
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,066
but we made it.

862
00:34:03,533 --> 00:34:06,900
That reminds me, actually,
not all of us made it.

863
00:34:07,033 --> 00:34:08,700
Daddy lost Bugsy.

864
00:34:08,834 --> 00:34:10,133
- Oh no!
- Daddy lost Bugsy.

865
00:34:10,266 --> 00:34:11,133
What?

866
00:34:11,266 --> 00:34:12,533
Yeah, Daddy lost Bugsy.

867
00:34:12,667 --> 00:34:13,700
Well, sweetie, he
might be on the airplane.

868
00:34:13,834 --> 00:34:14,700
I'll call the airline.

869
00:34:14,834 --> 00:34:15,800
Hey, girls, you know what?

870
00:34:15,934 --> 00:34:16,800
I didn't get my hug.

871
00:34:16,934 --> 00:34:18,367
Who wants to hug Auntie Hannah?

872
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,700
Aunt Hannah!

873
00:34:19,834 --> 00:34:20,800
Hi, sweetheart.

874
00:34:22,433 --> 00:34:23,867
Hello, you two.

875
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,467
It's so good to
see you girls again.

876
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,200
Think we'll ever
see Bugsy again?

877
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:28,533
'Course you will.

878
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:29,667
Oh.

879
00:34:31,667 --> 00:34:33,033
I gotta get this.

880
00:34:33,166 --> 00:34:34,133
Be right back.

881
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,233
Well, are you sure you're sure?

882
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:38,700
100%

883
00:34:38,834 --> 00:34:41,467
Congratulations, Hannah,
you're going to be a mother.

884
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,467
Oh, look!

885
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,867
Hey, Socks.

886
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Wow.

887
00:35:09,266 --> 00:35:11,467
Can we ride her, Mommy?

888
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,900
Not right now.

889
00:35:13,033 --> 00:35:15,000
I can walk 'em
around really slowly.

890
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,734
Maybe when you're
a little bit older.

891
00:35:17,867 --> 00:35:20,133
But last year, you said
wait until next year.

892
00:35:20,266 --> 00:35:21,467
It's already next year.

893
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,633
I've got helmets.

894
00:35:22,767 --> 00:35:24,900
You know what, I'm
going to have to say no.

895
00:35:26,266 --> 00:35:27,967
Hey, you know what?

896
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,633
I bet you he would love it
if you gave him a brush.

897
00:35:30,767 --> 00:35:33,633
Oh, that's a good idea.

898
00:35:33,767 --> 00:35:35,333
A brush.

899
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,300
It's pretty safe, you know.

900
00:35:40,433 --> 00:35:42,000
I'd make sure they didn't fall.

901
00:35:43,533 --> 00:35:46,467
Why chance it?

902
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,834
He's got a perfect record.

903
00:35:47,967 --> 00:35:49,300
Not one accident.

904
00:35:49,433 --> 00:35:51,467
I don't think anybody
plans on getting hurt, Posy.

905
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,166
That's why they
call it an accident.

906
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,467
Come on, you don't
want them growing up

907
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,400
being afraid of everything.

908
00:35:57,533 --> 00:35:59,834
Not everybody's a daredevil.

909
00:35:59,967 --> 00:36:01,633
Our parents were.

910
00:36:01,767 --> 00:36:04,800
Yep, and look what
happened to them.

911
00:36:07,834 --> 00:36:10,533
You know, Mom worries about
you when you go climbing.

912
00:36:10,667 --> 00:36:12,867
What, am I supposed to
stop doing what I love

913
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,467
just because it makes
someone nervous?

914
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,233
Well, it's not just someone.

915
00:36:17,667 --> 00:36:19,633
It must be nice to
have your freedom.

916
00:36:19,767 --> 00:36:21,300
What freedom?

917
00:36:21,433 --> 00:36:24,533
I have my entire future
mapped out for me.

918
00:36:24,667 --> 00:36:26,533
You and Hannah get to live
the lives that you want

919
00:36:26,667 --> 00:36:28,800
while I'm stuck here,
working at the cafe.

920
00:36:28,934 --> 00:36:31,300
You don't think Mom
and Dad felt stuck?

921
00:36:31,433 --> 00:36:32,467
Do you think their plans

922
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,300
involved raising
three little girls?

923
00:36:35,433 --> 00:36:37,500
Sometimes you have
to make sacrifices.

924
00:36:39,934 --> 00:36:44,200
We all do.

925
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:45,734
Good job, girls.

926
00:36:45,867 --> 00:36:47,233
Nice and gentle.

927
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,033
What is that?

928
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:54,033
That's a snowman.

929
00:36:54,166 --> 00:36:56,133
I thought it was a turtle.

930
00:36:56,266 --> 00:36:57,700
Is he making fun of Pudgy?

931
00:36:57,834 --> 00:36:59,900
You named your snowman Pudgy?

932
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,967
Well, it's definitely accurate.

933
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,200
Gosh, I remember this
like it was yesterday.

934
00:37:04,333 --> 00:37:05,400
- Let's see.
- Look.

935
00:37:08,233 --> 00:37:10,767
These girls were best friends.

936
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,433
Oh, it's my favorite
picture of you girls.

937
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:17,133
Look, they are at
the fairy creek.

938
00:37:17,266 --> 00:37:18,934
They have fairies here?

939
00:37:19,066 --> 00:37:20,400
Oh, yes.

940
00:37:20,533 --> 00:37:22,967
You can't come all the way
here and not go to fairy creek.

941
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,033
Can we go?

942
00:37:24,166 --> 00:37:26,300
Please, please, please?
- Please?

943
00:37:27,567 --> 00:37:28,700
Sure.

944
00:37:28,834 --> 00:37:31,300
But Auntie Posy would
have to be the guide.

945
00:37:31,433 --> 00:37:33,800
I don't think I would
remember how to get there.

946
00:37:34,834 --> 00:37:35,934
I would love to.

947
00:37:36,066 --> 00:37:37,600
Thanks.

948
00:37:37,734 --> 00:37:39,700
Dad's promised Paul
Bunyan over here

949
00:37:39,834 --> 00:37:41,200
that we would go to
the Lumberjack Games,

950
00:37:41,333 --> 00:37:42,767
so we're in for that.

951
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,934
Oh yeah, we're in for that.

952
00:37:44,066 --> 00:37:46,400
And I gotta be honest,
I'm very excited.

953
00:37:47,467 --> 00:37:49,800
Adam, you in, buddy?

954
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,100
Sounds good to me.

955
00:37:51,233 --> 00:37:52,233
Hannah?

956
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,934
Where's Hannah?

957
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:57,033
I'll be back.

958
00:37:59,834 --> 00:38:03,500
Look at this blue hair.

959
00:38:03,633 --> 00:38:05,834
Hey.

960
00:38:05,967 --> 00:38:06,934
Everything all right?

961
00:38:07,066 --> 00:38:08,834
Yeah, I'm great.

962
00:38:08,967 --> 00:38:10,100
Why don't you come join us?

963
00:38:10,233 --> 00:38:11,600
Posy and Luke are going
through old photo albums

964
00:38:11,734 --> 00:38:14,600
and I think I'm close to
checkmating your dad, so...

965
00:38:14,734 --> 00:38:15,967
I'll be in, in a minute.

966
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,100
Okay, what is it?

967
00:38:20,233 --> 00:38:21,934
It's just...

968
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:24,367
It's just a headache really.

969
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,467
No big deal.

970
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,834
I just...

971
00:38:27,967 --> 00:38:31,934
You have working too hard.

972
00:38:32,066 --> 00:38:33,867
It's supposed to be
a time to unwind.

973
00:38:34,967 --> 00:38:36,000
Yeah.

974
00:38:36,133 --> 00:38:37,200
Okay, listen, I have an idea.

975
00:38:37,333 --> 00:38:40,867
What if, after I wrap
up this next case,

976
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,500
you and I go on a real vacation?

977
00:38:43,633 --> 00:38:44,500
I don't know.

978
00:38:44,633 --> 00:38:45,700
Hear me out, hear me out.

979
00:38:45,834 --> 00:38:47,700
We'll go somewhere secluded.

980
00:38:47,834 --> 00:38:48,800
No kids.

981
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:55,934
A small island, just you,
me, and endless margaritas.

982
00:38:56,066 --> 00:39:00,400
I don't think a vacation
is in our immediate future.

983
00:39:00,533 --> 00:39:04,333
Why?

984
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:05,500
Adam, I-

985
00:39:05,633 --> 00:39:06,600
We're going to start charades.

986
00:39:06,734 --> 00:39:08,000
Do you guys want to play?

987
00:39:09,033 --> 00:39:10,767
Count us in, yes please.

988
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,066
I can definitely beat
your dad at charades.

989
00:39:15,266 --> 00:39:16,266
Okay.

990
00:39:18,633 --> 00:39:19,567
Sorry, I cut you off.

991
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,400
What were you going to say?

992
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:22,500
Um.

993
00:39:24,233 --> 00:39:25,834
I was just going to remind you

994
00:39:25,967 --> 00:39:28,567
not to get so
competitive with my dad.

995
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,667
Charades.

996
00:39:34,867 --> 00:39:36,834
First new message.

997
00:39:36,967 --> 00:39:38,834
Hi, Beth,
it's Corinna again.

998
00:39:38,967 --> 00:39:40,066
Look, I know you're busy,

999
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,834
but I emailed you
the brief anyways.

1000
00:39:41,967 --> 00:39:43,266
Just look at it.

1001
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,900
You don't want to look
back years from now

1002
00:39:45,033 --> 00:39:46,734
and regret not doing this.

1003
00:39:46,867 --> 00:39:47,834
Call me.

1004
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,000
Beth, we're
starting charades!

1005
00:39:51,133 --> 00:39:52,100
Coming.

1006
00:40:00,967 --> 00:40:02,567
This is where
real fairies live?

1007
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,066
That's right,

1008
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,400
but they only come out when
there's no people around.

1009
00:40:06,533 --> 00:40:08,233
Do they have magic powers?

1010
00:40:08,367 --> 00:40:09,433
Oh, absolutely.

1011
00:40:09,567 --> 00:40:11,834
In fact, if you can find
a little round stone,

1012
00:40:11,967 --> 00:40:13,333
make a wish, toss
it in the water,

1013
00:40:13,467 --> 00:40:15,100
and your wish will come true.

1014
00:40:16,467 --> 00:40:17,834
What'd you find?

1015
00:40:17,967 --> 00:40:19,734
Can I wish for
Bugsy to come home?

1016
00:40:19,867 --> 00:40:21,233
I don't see why not.

1017
00:40:21,367 --> 00:40:23,066
Let's get you one too.

1018
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,500
Okay, now I'm going to take
you girls to the wishing spot.

1019
00:40:25,633 --> 00:40:26,834
Oh yeah, okay.

1020
00:40:26,967 --> 00:40:28,333
They come right over here.

1021
00:40:29,467 --> 00:40:31,000
Okay, close your
eyes and make a wish

1022
00:40:31,133 --> 00:40:32,367
and throw it in the water.

1023
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:35,667
That's so good!

1024
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,500
It's gonna come true, good job!

1025
00:40:37,633 --> 00:40:38,734
My wish, Mom, I made a wish!

1026
00:40:38,867 --> 00:40:40,400
Good job, sweetie.

1027
00:40:40,533 --> 00:40:42,934
Well, here we are
on the magical bridge!

1028
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:44,333
Here we are.

1029
00:40:44,467 --> 00:40:45,900
It seems way bigger back then.

1030
00:40:46,033 --> 00:40:48,400
Yeah, well, we were just kids.

1031
00:40:48,533 --> 00:40:49,567
Hey, you know what?

1032
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,066
We should recreate that photo.

1033
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,567
Oh, that's a great idea.

1034
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,567
I'll take it.

1035
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,567
Posy, give me your phone.

1036
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,600
Yours is way newer than mine.

1037
00:40:56,734 --> 00:40:58,233
Now take a seat,
Hannah in the middle.

1038
00:40:58,367 --> 00:41:00,633
Oh, we don't have to
actually sit on the ground.

1039
00:41:00,767 --> 00:41:01,800
I think you'll live.

1040
00:41:01,934 --> 00:41:02,800
Do we really have
to sit on the ground?

1041
00:41:02,934 --> 00:41:03,800
You're so pushy, come on.

1042
00:41:03,934 --> 00:41:05,333
Squeeze in close.

1043
00:41:05,467 --> 00:41:08,000
I just don't understand
why you have to do that.

1044
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:09,300
Why I have to do what?

1045
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:10,500
Tell her to make
a wish for Bugsy.

1046
00:41:10,633 --> 00:41:12,233
Now she's going to
be disappointed.

1047
00:41:12,367 --> 00:41:13,967
Look on the bright side, at
least your daughter's going-

1048
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:14,967
Girls!

1049
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,300
Hey, can we not do this now?

1050
00:41:16,433 --> 00:41:17,834
Big smiles.

1051
00:41:17,967 --> 00:41:20,500
Hannah, I think your arms
were around your sisters.

1052
00:41:21,767 --> 00:41:25,934
Hold on.

1053
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,367
Beth.
- Oh, oh!

1054
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,333
Sorry.

1055
00:41:40,467 --> 00:41:41,834
You startled me.

1056
00:41:41,967 --> 00:41:42,834
I didn't mean
to interrupt you.

1057
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:44,000
We are leaving in five minutes.

1058
00:41:44,133 --> 00:41:45,100
Okay.

1059
00:42:12,133 --> 00:42:16,233
On your marks, get set!

1060
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,667
What are they doing, Grandpa?

1061
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,834
Well, this is the cross
cut saw competition.

1062
00:42:19,967 --> 00:42:21,266
The teams are racing each other

1063
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,867
to see who can cut through
the logs the fastest.

1064
00:42:27,867 --> 00:42:29,233
I want to show Luke
the wood carving.

1065
00:42:29,367 --> 00:42:32,000
I want to try my hand at
a little speed chopping.

1066
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:33,166
What?

1067
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,166
Well, there's a
lot to see here,

1068
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,667
so why don't we just split up

1069
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,266
and meet over the hot saw
competition in about an hour?

1070
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,300
And we'll take Melly and
Ruby over to the kids area.

1071
00:42:39,433 --> 00:42:40,300
How about that?

1072
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:41,300
Good?

1073
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:42,300
Let's go.

1074
00:42:42,433 --> 00:42:43,400
We'll go this way.

1075
00:42:45,533 --> 00:42:46,667
Thanks for coming along.

1076
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,934
I'm sure you'd much
rather be climbing.

1077
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:49,266
No way, miss this?

1078
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,767
I love this stuff.

1079
00:42:52,066 --> 00:42:54,667
Plus, there's always
time to go climbing.

1080
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,433
Oh, you are leaving next week.

1081
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:04,233
Unless of course you
want to extend your trip?

1082
00:43:04,367 --> 00:43:07,166
Is that an invitation?

1083
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:13,467
Maybe.

1084
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,734
What do you think
about Luke and Posy?

1085
00:43:15,867 --> 00:43:16,967
They seem pretty
good together,

1086
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,433
from what little I've seen.

1087
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,133
They both love climbing.

1088
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:25,233
Shared interests
are always good.

1089
00:43:25,367 --> 00:43:26,233
Thank you.

1090
00:43:26,367 --> 00:43:27,834
They're both adrenaline junkies.

1091
00:43:28,967 --> 00:43:31,567
You used to be a bit like that.

1092
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,400
I think you're talking
about someone else.

1093
00:43:33,533 --> 00:43:34,900
Oh, come on.

1094
00:43:35,033 --> 00:43:36,400
When we first met, you were
into all sorts of things.

1095
00:43:36,533 --> 00:43:38,467
It was you that talked me
into going cliff jumping

1096
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,400
at the lake that summer.

1097
00:43:40,533 --> 00:43:42,400
I blame you for my
fear of heights.

1098
00:43:43,934 --> 00:43:45,333
I was a
different person back then.

1099
00:43:45,467 --> 00:43:48,133
You know, I guess there was
things that used to scare me

1100
00:43:48,266 --> 00:43:49,600
that don't anymore.

1101
00:43:49,734 --> 00:43:51,567
And then there are things
that I thought would scare me,

1102
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,467
maybe to the point that I
never wanted to do them,

1103
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,667
and I think now maybe
I would like to.

1104
00:43:57,433 --> 00:44:01,533
Okay, you lost me a little
bit back there, but...

1105
00:44:01,667 --> 00:44:05,200
But whichever Hannah this is

1106
00:44:05,333 --> 00:44:10,133
and whatever scary thing you
want to do or not do, I'm in.

1107
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,233
Thank you.

1108
00:44:14,367 --> 00:44:17,800
Cheers.

1109
00:44:28,834 --> 00:44:33,066
Come on, come on, you
got it, you got it, yeah!

1110
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,200
What do you say, Mr. McBride?

1111
00:44:34,333 --> 00:44:35,700
You want to give it a shot?

1112
00:44:35,834 --> 00:44:38,367
Oh, do not challenge him
'cause he might just do it.

1113
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,900
No, but I have another
challenge in mind.

1114
00:44:41,033 --> 00:44:42,667
Oh no, now you've done it.

1115
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,133
What'd I do?

1116
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:48,533
Be afraid.

1117
00:44:48,667 --> 00:44:50,367
Okay.

1118
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:57,166
What are we playing for?

1119
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:58,200
Playing for chili?

1120
00:44:58,333 --> 00:44:59,734
Well, not just any chili.

1121
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,133
Loser has to eat the
five alarm chili.

1122
00:45:04,266 --> 00:45:10,867
Oh.

1123
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,433
You're on.

1124
00:45:12,567 --> 00:45:13,867
No, no, no, Luke, listen.

1125
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,133
You don't have to, really.

1126
00:45:15,266 --> 00:45:16,533
I'm feeling pretty
good about this.

1127
00:45:16,667 --> 00:45:19,266
Plus I got a cast iron stomach.

1128
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,567
Oh gosh.

1129
00:45:31,567 --> 00:45:35,533
Come on, Luke, you got this.

1130
00:45:35,667 --> 00:45:36,700
Go, Luke!

1131
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,300
Good, that was good.

1132
00:45:41,433 --> 00:45:42,934
That was pretty good.

1133
00:45:43,066 --> 00:45:44,533
All right, come on, Dad!

1134
00:45:44,667 --> 00:45:45,934
What ever happened
to "Come on, Luke?"

1135
00:45:46,066 --> 00:45:47,233
I don't know, he's family.

1136
00:45:55,166 --> 00:45:57,767
Iron stomach.

1137
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:02,667
Nice one, Dad.

1138
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,333
Did I ever tell you
guys about the time-

1139
00:46:05,467 --> 00:46:07,433
That you won the blue
ribbon at the chili cook-off?

1140
00:46:07,567 --> 00:46:10,533
And held the title for two
years until Francis Miller won

1141
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:13,266
with what you thought
was a stolen recipe.

1142
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,266
Yes.

1143
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,667
Dad, we got it.

1144
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,000
Oh man, I just love this.

1145
00:46:17,133 --> 00:46:19,500
Mr. North's chili is
always my favorite.

1146
00:46:19,633 --> 00:46:21,100
How you doing
over there, Luke?

1147
00:46:21,233 --> 00:46:22,834
I'm going, I'm going.

1148
00:46:22,967 --> 00:46:24,100
Luke, don't worry, mate,

1149
00:46:24,233 --> 00:46:26,600
the first aid tents
are right over there.

1150
00:46:28,133 --> 00:46:32,600
Just in case.

1151
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:43,333
It's not bad.

1152
00:46:50,633 --> 00:46:53,367
Oh man!

1153
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,834
This should be illegal, I
think my tongue's going numb.

1154
00:46:55,967 --> 00:46:58,600
Good, because you have
to finish the whole bowl.

1155
00:46:58,734 --> 00:46:59,600
Dad.

1156
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:02,400
I'm kidding, I'm just kidding.

1157
00:47:02,533 --> 00:47:03,500
Are you crying?

1158
00:47:04,533 --> 00:47:07,000
No, it's still burning.

1159
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:21,000
Hey, you
just missed the guys.

1160
00:47:21,133 --> 00:47:22,233
Oh yeah.

1161
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:23,667
I'm gonna meet up
with them later.

1162
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,667
Beth and I promised the girls
we'd make special cookies

1163
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,066
for grandma's birthday.

1164
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,333
That's sweet.

1165
00:47:30,467 --> 00:47:32,600
Wow, somebody's phone
is really blowing up.

1166
00:47:33,633 --> 00:47:34,934
It's Beth's.

1167
00:47:35,066 --> 00:47:37,100
She's still sleeping,
I'll drop it off to her.

1168
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:43,500
Huh.

1169
00:47:43,633 --> 00:47:44,500
Everything okay?

1170
00:47:44,633 --> 00:47:46,333
Yeah, fine.

1171
00:47:51,367 --> 00:47:53,000
Good morning.

1172
00:47:53,133 --> 00:47:54,166
Where are the girls?

1173
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:55,700
Playing in the living room.

1174
00:47:58,800 --> 00:47:59,934
Why didn't you tell me?

1175
00:48:00,133 --> 00:48:01,233
I can explain this.

1176
00:48:01,367 --> 00:48:03,467
I thought we put
that behind us.

1177
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,900
You lied to me.

1178
00:48:05,033 --> 00:48:06,600
I just sent a few ideas.

1179
00:48:07,967 --> 00:48:12,000
Jason, wait.

1180
00:48:12,133 --> 00:48:13,233
Hey.

1181
00:48:13,367 --> 00:48:14,333
Where is everyone?

1182
00:48:15,367 --> 00:48:16,233
There are a lot of us.

1183
00:48:16,367 --> 00:48:17,600
Can you be more specific?

1184
00:48:18,934 --> 00:48:20,233
Mom, Posy.

1185
00:48:20,367 --> 00:48:21,233
Posy's heading to work.

1186
00:48:21,367 --> 00:48:22,467
Mom's being pampered.

1187
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,800
It's just you here?

1188
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:25,066
Yes.

1189
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,233
Can you...

1190
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:28,967
Can you watch the
girls for a little bit?

1191
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:29,967
Watch them do what?

1192
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:31,000
Oh my...

1193
00:48:31,133 --> 00:48:32,133
I'm joking.

1194
00:48:32,266 --> 00:48:33,500
Of course I will.

1195
00:48:34,533 --> 00:48:35,400
What is going on, Beth?

1196
00:48:35,533 --> 00:48:37,233
Jason's upset.

1197
00:48:38,467 --> 00:48:43,233
I may have not told him
something important.

1198
00:48:43,367 --> 00:48:44,834
I think there's
a word for that.

1199
00:48:44,967 --> 00:48:46,233
No.

1200
00:48:46,367 --> 00:48:49,467
No, I did not lie, okay?

1201
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,567
Okay.

1202
00:48:52,433 --> 00:48:55,834
Maybe a little.

1203
00:48:55,967 --> 00:48:56,834
Fine, go.

1204
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:58,333
I've got the girls,

1205
00:48:58,467 --> 00:49:00,333
unless of course you think
they're going to eat me alive.

1206
00:49:01,367 --> 00:49:02,233
Go, Mom.

1207
00:49:02,367 --> 00:49:03,333
Thank you, Hannah.

1208
00:49:15,033 --> 00:49:17,333
Wow.

1209
00:49:19,633 --> 00:49:20,767
Thanks for walking me to work.

1210
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:21,767
You didn't have to do that.

1211
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:22,867
I wanted to.

1212
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,233
How's the book coming?

1213
00:49:26,367 --> 00:49:27,233
Good.

1214
00:49:27,367 --> 00:49:28,767
I hit a bit of a snag.

1215
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,433
Oh, writer's block?

1216
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:31,433
Yeah, something like that.

1217
00:49:31,567 --> 00:49:32,767
I'm sure it'll
come back to ya.

1218
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:37,567
So how many rescues
have you been a part of?

1219
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,333
Not too many since I started.

1220
00:49:39,467 --> 00:49:41,000
Luckily nothing too serious.

1221
00:49:41,133 --> 00:49:43,333
Must get a lot of
satisfaction from it.

1222
00:49:43,467 --> 00:49:44,900
Might sound crazy,

1223
00:49:45,033 --> 00:49:47,400
but I feel like it brings me
closer to my birth parents.

1224
00:49:47,533 --> 00:49:50,266
Swear I can feel them
with me sometimes.

1225
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,500
How does Suzanne feel
about you doing this?

1226
00:49:54,633 --> 00:49:56,567
I know you said that she's
not crazy about your climbing,

1227
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:59,266
but I can imagine that'd
be hard for her too, right?

1228
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,000
Sure she'd rather I didn't,
though she'd never say it.

1229
00:50:04,133 --> 00:50:05,400
It's normal.

1230
00:50:05,533 --> 00:50:06,834
She just wants you to be safe.

1231
00:50:06,967 --> 00:50:08,567
Yeah.

1232
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:11,066
It's more than that though.

1233
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,000
I didn't tell you
the whole story.

1234
00:50:13,133 --> 00:50:16,767
Suzanne was actually
leading the expedition

1235
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:18,900
on the day that my parents died.

1236
00:50:19,033 --> 00:50:20,600
Her and my mom
were best friends.

1237
00:50:22,633 --> 00:50:24,567
They were a little ways
away from the summit

1238
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:27,166
and rocks triggered
a slide and...

1239
00:50:31,033 --> 00:50:33,066
Posy, sometimes
it's no one's fault.

1240
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,100
Yeah, I know, that's what
we keep trying to tell her.

1241
00:50:35,233 --> 00:50:36,200
She won't hear it.

1242
00:50:38,367 --> 00:50:40,433
So they were still in
Michigan at the time?

1243
00:50:40,567 --> 00:50:41,834
Yeah, yeah.

1244
00:50:41,967 --> 00:50:44,166
They were just working
here for the winter,

1245
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:45,667
working as guides.

1246
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,333
This is where my dad, I mean,
Stewart's family is from.

1247
00:50:49,867 --> 00:50:52,900
And so after they adopted us,
they knew they needed help,

1248
00:50:53,033 --> 00:50:54,934
so they moved here to
be closer to family.

1249
00:50:55,066 --> 00:50:56,066
And it worked out.

1250
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,266
They helped out with the cafe

1251
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,166
and his parents
helped out with us.

1252
00:51:00,533 --> 00:51:02,066
The cafe was in the family.

1253
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,066
Yeah, they were so happy
when he took it over,

1254
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:07,834
and one day I will do the same.

1255
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:12,467
Well, thanks for the walk, Luke.

1256
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,900
You sure don't want
to come inside?

1257
00:51:14,033 --> 00:51:16,467
I can hook you up with
our famous blueberry pie.

1258
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,400
Well, if you're
going to twist my arm.

1259
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:26,467
There you go.

1260
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,567
Thank you.

1261
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,467
What do I owe you?

1262
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:30,667
Oh, it's on the house.

1263
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,500
Oh, in that case, I'll take
three more of these to go.

1264
00:51:32,633 --> 00:51:34,300
Don't press your luck.

1265
00:51:34,433 --> 00:51:35,967
Actually, I would like
to make a contribution

1266
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:37,400
to the mountain rescue fund,

1267
00:51:37,533 --> 00:51:39,800
so could I get a dozen
of those cookies?

1268
00:51:39,934 --> 00:51:41,233
That I'll happily
charge you for.

1269
00:51:41,367 --> 00:51:42,467
Great.

1270
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,834
Oh, table three
needs their check.

1271
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:45,500
Oh, hey, Posy.

1272
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:50,567
I wanted to say thank
you for inviting me out

1273
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:52,166
with your family yesterday.

1274
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:53,400
I had a great time.

1275
00:51:53,533 --> 00:51:54,800
Yeah, it was really fun.

1276
00:51:54,934 --> 00:51:56,900
Everyone really likes you.

1277
00:51:57,033 --> 00:51:59,266
Maybe we could do
it again sometime.

1278
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:02,367
Yeah, I'd love that.

1279
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:03,567
- Great.
- Yeah.

1280
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,800
But if people see us
hanging out together,

1281
00:52:08,934 --> 00:52:12,133
they might get the
impression that we're dating.

1282
00:52:12,266 --> 00:52:13,467
I don't worry about
what other people think.

1283
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,734
I don't think I believe you.

1284
00:52:21,066 --> 00:52:22,066
Believe me now?

1285
00:52:31,767 --> 00:52:34,734
I told her I wasn't
interested in taking the job,

1286
00:52:34,867 --> 00:52:35,834
I promise.

1287
00:52:36,867 --> 00:52:39,533
But the next thing you know,

1288
00:52:39,667 --> 00:52:43,967
she's convinced me to take a
stab at a marketing proposal.

1289
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:45,233
Convinced.

1290
00:52:45,367 --> 00:52:46,500
More like manipulated.

1291
00:52:48,934 --> 00:52:51,734
But Beth, we've always
told each other everything.

1292
00:52:51,867 --> 00:52:52,834
Why not this?

1293
00:52:55,266 --> 00:52:59,300
I don't know, I guess
I just wanted to know

1294
00:52:59,433 --> 00:53:02,533
if I still have what it takes.

1295
00:53:02,667 --> 00:53:04,967
Of course you still
have what it takes.

1296
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:06,734
You're great at
everything you do.

1297
00:53:08,834 --> 00:53:13,433
I guess I just thought that
maybe after all these years,

1298
00:53:13,567 --> 00:53:15,700
I've lost it, you know?

1299
00:53:15,834 --> 00:53:17,367
I mean, Jason,

1300
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,266
if you had to give
up your career and be
a stay-at-home dad,

1301
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,800
you would've felt the same way.

1302
00:53:20,934 --> 00:53:23,200
When we decided to have kids,

1303
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:25,600
it was your decision
to walk away.

1304
00:53:25,734 --> 00:53:27,100
I know.

1305
00:53:27,233 --> 00:53:28,533
If you really want
to go back to work,

1306
00:53:28,667 --> 00:53:32,100
even if it is for
Corinna, I'll support you.

1307
00:53:32,233 --> 00:53:33,700
We'll figure it out.

1308
00:53:33,834 --> 00:53:35,800
You really think we
can make this work?

1309
00:53:36,834 --> 00:53:39,367
I do.

1310
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,767
I'm sorry.

1311
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,767
It's okay.

1312
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:55,767
By the way, who's watching
the girls right now?

1313
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,100
Good job, girls.

1314
00:53:57,233 --> 00:53:59,467
Your mom is going
to be so impressed.

1315
00:54:01,133 --> 00:54:02,000
Aunt Hannah?

1316
00:54:02,133 --> 00:54:03,333
Mm-hm?

1317
00:54:03,467 --> 00:54:05,500
Do you think Bugsy will
ever find his way home?

1318
00:54:05,633 --> 00:54:07,100
Sure.

1319
00:54:07,233 --> 00:54:09,867
Did you ever lose someone
you love more than anything?

1320
00:54:11,233 --> 00:54:13,333
Yeah, I did, honey.

1321
00:54:16,467 --> 00:54:17,867
I have to get this.

1322
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:18,867
We're going to have
a little break,

1323
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,767
but don't eat the product.

1324
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:22,934
All right?

1325
00:54:23,066 --> 00:54:24,033
Hello?

1326
00:54:31,467 --> 00:54:32,367
Okay, sounds good.

1327
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,000
Oh, and heads up, they
don't make them anymore,

1328
00:54:34,133 --> 00:54:36,100
so you're going to have
your work cut out for you.

1329
00:54:36,233 --> 00:54:37,433
Tell you what, drop
everything you're doing,

1330
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:38,667
make it a top priority.

1331
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,200
Sure, let me do some digging.

1332
00:54:40,333 --> 00:54:41,500
Great.

1333
00:54:41,633 --> 00:54:42,767
And Lexi, I know that I
don't do a very good job

1334
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:45,667
of telling you this, but
I really appreciate you.

1335
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:48,667
I know, but it's
also nice to hear.

1336
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:49,767
All right, bye.

1337
00:54:57,166 --> 00:54:59,667
Melly, Ruby!

1338
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:00,834
We're home.

1339
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:06,266
I'm a cookie.

1340
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,600
So how are my little
cookie monsters?

1341
00:55:08,734 --> 00:55:11,266
Oh, wow, I am so sorry.

1342
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,333
I only left them
for like a minute.

1343
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,667
Hey, girls, let's go
get cleaned up, come on.

1344
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:22,400
Okay.

1345
00:55:22,533 --> 00:55:25,066
It only takes a second
for them to get into things.

1346
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,500
Well, thank goodness
it was something harmless

1347
00:55:26,633 --> 00:55:27,600
like frosting.

1348
00:55:27,734 --> 00:55:28,667
That's not the point, Hannah.

1349
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:29,667
What is your point?

1350
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,567
I asked you to watch them,

1351
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:36,333
not let them run wild while
you took care of work.

1352
00:55:36,467 --> 00:55:37,400
I said I was sorry.

1353
00:55:37,533 --> 00:55:38,600
You know what?

1354
00:55:38,734 --> 00:55:39,600
This is my fault.

1355
00:55:39,734 --> 00:55:40,867
I should have known better.

1356
00:55:45,867 --> 00:55:48,667
Hannah, what I mean-

1357
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,100
Oh, I know what you mean.

1358
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,500
Hannah.

1359
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,300
I only left them
for like a minute.

1360
00:56:23,433 --> 00:56:24,834
Yeah, not good.

1361
00:56:24,967 --> 00:56:26,133
We were having so much fun.

1362
00:56:26,266 --> 00:56:27,900
It was like I was the
cool aunt for once.

1363
00:56:28,033 --> 00:56:30,233
Well, let's be clear,
I'm the cool aunt.

1364
00:56:30,367 --> 00:56:31,467
Yeah, that's true.

1365
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:34,300
You know, Beth is right,
I'm not made for kids.

1366
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:36,300
Well, then you and Adam
are perfect for each other.

1367
00:56:36,433 --> 00:56:37,633
You know, not
everyone wants kids.

1368
00:56:37,767 --> 00:56:38,734
I'm pregnant.

1369
00:56:41,633 --> 00:56:45,467
That is exactly
the reaction I had.

1370
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,233
I'm trying to picture
you with a baby.

1371
00:56:47,367 --> 00:56:48,333
Posy!

1372
00:56:50,433 --> 00:56:51,834
Oh my gosh.

1373
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:52,967
You're going to be a great mom.

1374
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:54,166
I get to be an aunt again!

1375
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:56,500
Oh, congratulations.

1376
00:56:56,633 --> 00:56:57,734
You?

1377
00:56:57,867 --> 00:56:58,967
I mean...

1378
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:01,133
I mean, you did seem
a little preoccupied,

1379
00:57:01,266 --> 00:57:02,233
maybe a little bit distant.

1380
00:57:02,367 --> 00:57:03,467
I mean, more so than normal.

1381
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,033
Sorry, that didn't
come out right.

1382
00:57:05,166 --> 00:57:06,233
What did Adam say?

1383
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,300
Well...

1384
00:57:11,433 --> 00:57:12,567
Hannah.

1385
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:14,066
We weren't going
to have children.

1386
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,867
This is something I made very
clear before we got married.

1387
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,567
I know, but
circumstances change.

1388
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:21,800
You have to trust that
things are gonna work out.

1389
00:57:21,934 --> 00:57:23,533
I have always
loved that about you.

1390
00:57:23,667 --> 00:57:25,200
You've loved what about me?

1391
00:57:25,333 --> 00:57:26,533
You go with the flow.

1392
00:57:26,667 --> 00:57:28,433
You're like water.

1393
00:57:28,567 --> 00:57:29,433
I'm more like-

1394
00:57:29,567 --> 00:57:30,900
A brick wall?

1395
00:57:31,033 --> 00:57:33,133
Well, I might've
said more like a rock.

1396
00:57:33,266 --> 00:57:34,133
That works too.

1397
00:57:34,266 --> 00:57:35,233
But yes.

1398
00:57:37,834 --> 00:57:43,567
Posy, I don't know if I have
what it takes to be a good mom.

1399
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:49,533
When we moved here after the
accident, I was so terrified.

1400
00:57:49,667 --> 00:57:53,400
Everything we'd
ever known was gone.

1401
00:57:53,533 --> 00:57:55,200
I'll never forget
how comforting it was

1402
00:57:55,333 --> 00:57:57,633
to have you as my big sister.

1403
00:57:57,767 --> 00:57:58,633
Really?

1404
00:57:58,767 --> 00:57:59,734
Yeah.

1405
00:58:01,066 --> 00:58:07,767
And that's how
you'll be as a mom.

1406
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,967
I'm just a little scared.

1407
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:15,066
Yeah.

1408
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:25,800
Sure.

1409
00:58:25,934 --> 00:58:26,967
Hi.

1410
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:27,967
Hey.

1411
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:29,266
Welcome.

1412
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:30,700
Yes, sorry, I was
knocking for a while

1413
00:58:30,834 --> 00:58:32,100
and I just let myself in.

1414
00:58:32,233 --> 00:58:33,767
- That's great.
- Good.

1415
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:36,100
So one for the adults,
one for the kids.

1416
00:58:36,233 --> 00:58:38,000
And there was a
package out front.

1417
00:58:38,133 --> 00:58:39,000
That's for me.

1418
00:58:39,133 --> 00:58:40,133
Checkmate!

1419
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:41,133
It looks like
you're just in time

1420
00:58:41,266 --> 00:58:42,133
to watch history be made.

1421
00:58:42,266 --> 00:58:43,700
Thank you for these.

1422
00:58:45,066 --> 00:58:47,600
I won.

1423
00:58:47,734 --> 00:58:48,767
New chess master.

1424
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:49,800
Yeah!

1425
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:53,200
Thank you very much.

1426
00:58:53,333 --> 00:58:54,867
Oh, please, no,
it's no big deal.

1427
00:59:16,467 --> 00:59:17,433
We all came
running into the room

1428
00:59:17,567 --> 00:59:18,700
and there was Posy,

1429
00:59:18,834 --> 00:59:20,600
just standing on top
of the refrigerator.

1430
00:59:20,734 --> 00:59:22,867
What was she, about
five years old?

1431
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Her first official summit.

1432
00:59:25,133 --> 00:59:26,500
You were like a
little mountain goat,

1433
00:59:26,633 --> 00:59:28,166
climbing everything in sight.

1434
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:30,166
Oh, it was like
she had no fear.

1435
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:32,367
You know, one of my favorite
memories of her as a kid is

1436
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:33,600
when we got snowed
in at Christmas.

1437
00:59:33,734 --> 00:59:34,600
Do you remember that?

1438
00:59:34,734 --> 00:59:35,600
Right, okay.

1439
00:59:35,734 --> 00:59:36,700
So it snowed three days straight

1440
00:59:36,834 --> 00:59:38,200
and we couldn't leave the house.

1441
00:59:38,333 --> 00:59:40,333
So Posy's coming down the
stairs with a little toy shovel

1442
00:59:40,467 --> 00:59:43,433
saying she's going to
tunnel her way out.

1443
00:59:43,567 --> 00:59:44,700
I believed her.

1444
00:59:44,834 --> 00:59:45,700
We all did.

1445
00:59:45,834 --> 00:59:46,700
That's been fun.

1446
00:59:46,834 --> 00:59:48,266
Enough Posy stories.

1447
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,834
No, no, no, I love
this kind of stuff.

1448
00:59:49,967 --> 00:59:51,600
What's your favorite
childhood memory?

1449
00:59:51,734 --> 00:59:53,033
Easy.

1450
00:59:53,166 --> 00:59:55,500
10th birthday, my aunt
gave me my first real tent.

1451
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:58,600
So I camped out in the
backyard every night,

1452
00:59:58,734 --> 01:00:01,100
but I pretended I
was on Half Dome.

1453
01:00:01,233 --> 01:00:04,000
I thought to myself, I
could live like this.

1454
01:00:04,133 --> 01:00:06,867
And you do.

1455
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:07,934
You live your dream.

1456
01:00:08,066 --> 01:00:09,166
Been very lucky.

1457
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:11,767
Suzanne and I spent an
anniversary bivouacked

1458
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,000
on Half Dome.

1459
01:00:13,133 --> 01:00:14,433
What's bivouacked?

1460
01:00:14,567 --> 01:00:16,667
Well, sometimes it
takes more than one day

1461
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,000
to complete a climb,

1462
01:00:18,133 --> 01:00:21,867
so you sleep hanging off
the side of the rock.

1463
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:22,867
Why?

1464
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,367
My question exactly, Melly.

1465
01:00:25,633 --> 01:00:27,000
You really did that, Grandma?

1466
01:00:27,133 --> 01:00:28,166
Mm-hm.

1467
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:29,934
Your grandma was
quite the mountaineer.

1468
01:00:30,066 --> 01:00:31,533
Why don't you climb anymore?

1469
01:00:32,967 --> 01:00:34,834
Oh, it was a long time ago.

1470
01:00:34,967 --> 01:00:35,834
Yeah.

1471
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:36,867
Who's ready for
her birthday cake?

1472
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,433
That sounds great!

1473
01:00:40,133 --> 01:00:41,133
Great idea.

1474
01:00:41,266 --> 01:00:42,166
- Beth, will you help me?
- Yeah.

1475
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:44,333
So Luke, what's the next stop?

1476
01:00:44,467 --> 01:00:45,433
Chicago.

1477
01:00:45,567 --> 01:00:46,600
Promised my aunt I'd be back

1478
01:00:46,734 --> 01:00:48,934
for the annual Whitaker
family reunion.

1479
01:00:49,066 --> 01:00:51,000
- Oh, that sounds nice.
- Yeah.

1480
01:00:51,133 --> 01:00:56,100
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

1481
01:00:57,133 --> 01:01:00,500
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

1482
01:01:00,633 --> 01:01:05,600

1483
01:01:06,967 --> 01:01:11,000
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

1484
01:01:11,133 --> 01:01:12,000
Yay!

1485
01:01:12,133 --> 01:01:14,066
Happy 30th times two.

1486
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,166
It's perfect.

1487
01:01:16,967 --> 01:01:18,667
Okay.

1488
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:24,567
Here we go.

1489
01:01:28,033 --> 01:01:28,900
Thank you.

1490
01:01:29,033 --> 01:01:30,867
Wait, Whitaker.

1491
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Luke Whitaker.

1492
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:38,166
I knew you seemed familiar.

1493
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:40,000
Hannah, what are
you talking about?

1494
01:01:40,133 --> 01:01:41,266
A few months ago,

1495
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:44,266
I got some messages
from a Luke Whitaker

1496
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,834
who wanted to know
about the accident.

1497
01:01:46,967 --> 01:01:50,200
Wait, I got those
phone calls too.

1498
01:01:52,533 --> 01:01:53,834
Was that you?

1499
01:01:53,967 --> 01:01:56,233
What are you
guys talking about?

1500
01:01:56,367 --> 01:01:57,500
I can explain.

1501
01:01:57,633 --> 01:01:58,834
Explain what?

1502
01:01:58,967 --> 01:02:00,066
That's a new low.

1503
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:01,400
It's not that simple.

1504
01:02:01,533 --> 01:02:03,133
See, we've had people
chase this story before,

1505
01:02:03,266 --> 01:02:05,734
but none of them have
moved into the guest house.

1506
01:02:07,033 --> 01:02:09,300
A lot of people die climbing.

1507
01:02:09,433 --> 01:02:11,667
Why is our story so
important to you?

1508
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:15,633
Okay, girls.

1509
01:02:15,767 --> 01:02:17,300
We are going to go upstairs
and get ready for bed.

1510
01:02:17,433 --> 01:02:18,800
What about cake?

1511
01:02:18,934 --> 01:02:21,667
Well, we are going to
have cake after, I promise.

1512
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:22,967
Yeah, great idea.

1513
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:24,400
I was going to get
ready for bed too

1514
01:02:24,533 --> 01:02:27,767
so then later we can have
some cake in our PJs.

1515
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:35,667
Okay.

1516
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:39,800
I'm not just some
guy chasing a story.

1517
01:02:39,934 --> 01:02:45,233
My real last name is Palmer.

1518
01:02:45,367 --> 01:02:51,166
Cheryl and Brett Palmer?

1519
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:52,633
My parents were
the other couple

1520
01:02:52,767 --> 01:02:54,433
that died that day on Denali.

1521
01:03:05,867 --> 01:03:10,166
a.

1522
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:11,834
Posy, if I could just explain-

1523
01:03:11,967 --> 01:03:12,834
Excuse me.

1524
01:03:12,967 --> 01:03:14,200
- Posy.
- Honey, wait.

1525
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:20,433
Sit down, young man.

1526
01:03:26,467 --> 01:03:29,667
I was going to tell her.

1527
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:34,400
It wasn't supposed
to happen like this.

1528
01:03:34,533 --> 01:03:39,600
I'll pack my things and
be gone in the morning.

1529
01:03:39,734 --> 01:03:44,233
I thought about you.

1530
01:03:44,367 --> 01:03:48,233
All the time.

1531
01:03:48,367 --> 01:03:52,266
I didn't have the
courage to reach out.

1532
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:55,900
I couldn't face you.

1533
01:03:56,033 --> 01:03:59,000
I understand.

1534
01:03:59,133 --> 01:04:00,166
I just thought
you'd be better off

1535
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:01,734
without me as a reminder.

1536
01:04:03,633 --> 01:04:07,300
The woman who ruined your life.

1537
01:04:07,433 --> 01:04:10,300
Luke, I'm so sorry.

1538
01:04:10,433 --> 01:04:13,567
You don't need to apologize.

1539
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:15,300
It wasn't your fault

1540
01:04:15,433 --> 01:04:17,333
and you didn't ruin my life.

1541
01:04:18,633 --> 01:04:23,066
I've had an amazing life.

1542
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:27,066
I wanna hear.

1543
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,400
Everything.

1544
01:04:38,433 --> 01:04:39,734
Hi, Colin, can we sit here?

1545
01:04:39,867 --> 01:04:40,834
Of course.

1546
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:45,133
The McBride sisters,
together again.

1547
01:04:45,266 --> 01:04:46,233
What can I get you ladies?

1548
01:04:46,367 --> 01:04:47,333
White wine, please.

1549
01:04:47,467 --> 01:04:48,500
Bring the bottle.

1550
01:04:48,633 --> 01:04:49,900
I'll just have
a water, thanks.

1551
01:04:50,033 --> 01:04:51,000
Coming right up.

1552
01:04:53,133 --> 01:04:55,066
How could I be so gullible?

1553
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,333
It's not your fault.

1554
01:04:57,767 --> 01:04:59,066
I really liked him.

1555
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,300
Oh.

1556
01:05:00,433 --> 01:05:01,533
We don't know the whole story.

1557
01:05:01,667 --> 01:05:02,700
Oh, come on, you
can't be serious.

1558
01:05:02,834 --> 01:05:05,033
Maybe he's
looking for closure.

1559
01:05:05,166 --> 01:05:06,567
I mean, if anyone
can be sympathetic

1560
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:08,033
to what he's going
through, it's us.

1561
01:05:08,166 --> 01:05:10,233
No, no, no, I can't
believe I'm hearing this.

1562
01:05:10,367 --> 01:05:11,800
He lied to her.

1563
01:05:11,934 --> 01:05:14,200
Okay, I admit I like
this new side to you.

1564
01:05:14,333 --> 01:05:17,367
Yeah, well, somebody hurts
my little sister, I get angry.

1565
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:18,633
I'd do the same for you.

1566
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,867
Okay, I saw that.

1567
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,066
What?

1568
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:25,633
You don't think
I'd stand up for you.

1569
01:05:25,767 --> 01:05:26,967
I don't think you
think about me much.

1570
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:28,700
Can we not argue?

1571
01:05:28,834 --> 01:05:30,700
No, let's have it out
right here, right now.

1572
01:05:30,834 --> 01:05:32,800
So how's your
evening going so far?

1573
01:05:32,934 --> 01:05:34,800
Not now, Colin.

1574
01:05:34,934 --> 01:05:35,900
Right.

1575
01:05:36,934 --> 01:05:37,800
You know what?

1576
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:38,900
Hannah's right.

1577
01:05:40,166 --> 01:05:43,200
I'm so tired of us all
tiptoeing around everything.

1578
01:05:43,333 --> 01:05:45,500
Why did we stop being
honest with each other?

1579
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:47,800
Don't you think it's weird

1580
01:05:47,934 --> 01:05:49,467
that we never talk
about the accident?

1581
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:52,800
We don't talk about it
because we are protecting Mom.

1582
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:55,133
But why?

1583
01:05:55,266 --> 01:05:56,133
Why do you think everyone
needs protecting?

1584
01:05:56,266 --> 01:05:57,367
Mom, Melly, Ruby?

1585
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:58,800
Can we leave the
girls out of this?

1586
01:05:58,934 --> 01:06:01,100
I'm just saying that
they'll never have a chance

1587
01:06:01,233 --> 01:06:02,266
to skin their knees.

1588
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:03,967
A few bumps and bruises
are good for kids.

1589
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:06,367
Says the woman with no kids.

1590
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:08,300
It's not that you're
just overprotective.

1591
01:06:08,433 --> 01:06:10,300
You catastrophize everything.

1592
01:06:10,433 --> 01:06:13,200
I catastrophize everything
because bad things do happen.

1593
01:06:13,333 --> 01:06:15,700
Posy, they happen to us.

1594
01:06:15,834 --> 01:06:16,934
Beth is right.

1595
01:06:17,066 --> 01:06:19,033
It is so scary to bring
a kid into the world

1596
01:06:19,166 --> 01:06:20,266
that is so uncertain

1597
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,300
where parents could just
be swept away like that.

1598
01:06:22,433 --> 01:06:24,700
They need certainty
and stability.

1599
01:06:24,834 --> 01:06:26,266
Sorry, Hannah, I
love you, I do, I just,

1600
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:30,033
I just don't think you
know what's best for kids.

1601
01:06:30,166 --> 01:06:31,533
Beth.

1602
01:06:31,667 --> 01:06:33,867
I have lost count of how
many times you have canceled

1603
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,300
on Melly and Ruby.

1604
01:06:35,433 --> 01:06:37,533
Have you thought about
how that makes them feel?

1605
01:06:37,667 --> 01:06:38,767
It's just, I-

1606
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:40,700
Please don't say
that you're busy.

1607
01:06:40,834 --> 01:06:41,700
Do you want to know the truth?

1608
01:06:41,834 --> 01:06:44,033
I love those girls, but I...

1609
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:45,133
What?

1610
01:06:46,333 --> 01:06:49,600
What?

1611
01:06:49,734 --> 01:06:53,967
It's just too hard.

1612
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:58,400
They remind me of
you and Posy when...

1613
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:07,500
When Mom and Dad died.

1614
01:07:07,633 --> 01:07:12,433
And you, I will never
forget how afraid you were.

1615
01:07:15,467 --> 01:07:19,367
And I wanted so badly
to save you from pain,

1616
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:21,300
but I didn't know how.

1617
01:07:23,333 --> 01:07:25,200
You did.

1618
01:07:25,333 --> 01:07:26,200
You did.

1619
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:27,433
Yeah.

1620
01:07:27,567 --> 01:07:28,500
I don't know what
I would have done

1621
01:07:28,633 --> 01:07:30,266
if I didn't have you to lean on.

1622
01:07:32,467 --> 01:07:35,266
Hannah, you were
just a kid too.

1623
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:38,767
That wasn't fair to you.

1624
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:40,266
I just,

1625
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:43,200
I never considered how hard
that must've been for you.

1626
01:07:43,333 --> 01:07:44,300
I'm sorry.

1627
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:49,700
Sounds a lot like motherhood.

1628
01:07:49,834 --> 01:07:54,433
No matter how you felt,
you were always there for us.

1629
01:07:54,567 --> 01:07:59,033
That's why you'll
make a great mom.

1630
01:08:02,133 --> 01:08:03,433
Oh my...

1631
01:08:03,567 --> 01:08:04,867
You're pregnant.

1632
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:10,500
I think she's blown a fuse.

1633
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:18,166
For the record, I'll
still be the cool aunt.

1634
01:08:21,533 --> 01:08:24,567
I've made a career
writing travel guides

1635
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:25,867
related to climbing.

1636
01:08:27,066 --> 01:08:29,333
But I decided that I
wanted to shift gears

1637
01:08:29,467 --> 01:08:31,266
and write about
something different.

1638
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:35,400
So I set out to write
a survival book,

1639
01:08:35,533 --> 01:08:37,767
not just for climbers
that survived accidents,

1640
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:40,500
but for the people
that were left behind

1641
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:45,066
by climbers that
weren't so lucky.

1642
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:47,667
People like you all.

1643
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:50,333
Like Hannah, Beth, and Posy.

1644
01:08:50,467 --> 01:08:53,400
People like myself.

1645
01:08:53,533 --> 01:08:58,066
I thought it might
bring some closure.

1646
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:01,066
We could all use some closure.

1647
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:05,133
I don't blame you, Suzanne.

1648
01:09:05,266 --> 01:09:07,967
After all the research that
I've done about that day,

1649
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:09,500
nothing points to anything

1650
01:09:09,633 --> 01:09:12,133
other than a random
act of nature.

1651
01:09:12,266 --> 01:09:13,667
There are always signs.

1652
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:17,567
Yes, but my parents chose
to go up there that day.

1653
01:09:18,767 --> 01:09:21,000
As climbers, we know
there are always risks

1654
01:09:21,133 --> 01:09:23,000
and we calculate those risks.

1655
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,567
And it's not my
place to say this,

1656
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:28,300
but it seems to me like the
best way to honor my parents is

1657
01:09:28,433 --> 01:09:29,834
for you to forgive yourself.

1658
01:09:44,867 --> 01:09:47,734
Thank you.

1659
01:09:54,033 --> 01:09:57,633
Oh, I swear, this
woman never sleeps.

1660
01:09:57,767 --> 01:09:59,734
She's constantly
calling me, texting me.

1661
01:09:59,867 --> 01:10:01,567
Hannah, what are you doing?

1662
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:04,467
You're going
to get me fired.

1663
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,800
She can't fire you if
she hasn't hired you.

1664
01:10:06,934 --> 01:10:08,400
She is using you.

1665
01:10:08,533 --> 01:10:10,400
Beth, if you want to go
back to work, that's great.

1666
01:10:10,533 --> 01:10:12,900
There are plenty of places that
would be lucky to have you,

1667
01:10:13,033 --> 01:10:14,967
places that won't
make you miserable

1668
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:16,400
like working with Corinna.

1669
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:18,667
I know, but it's
been seven years,

1670
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,567
I wouldn't even know
where to start, Hannah.

1671
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:23,133
Well, I'll help
you if you'll let me.

1672
01:10:27,367 --> 01:10:29,333
Okay, but only if you let
me help you with the baby.

1673
01:10:29,467 --> 01:10:30,433
Count on it.

1674
01:10:35,767 --> 01:10:37,166
Bye, Corinna.

1675
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:38,500
Bye.

1676
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:42,567
I feel good.

1677
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:44,567
Congratulations, you are free.

1678
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:47,066
Okay, now that
we've dealt with that,

1679
01:10:49,467 --> 01:10:52,133
let's deal with you.

1680
01:10:52,266 --> 01:10:54,800
Oh, I'm good.

1681
01:10:54,934 --> 01:10:56,900
My life is here,
I'm cool with that.

1682
01:10:57,033 --> 01:10:59,567
No, no.

1683
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:00,967
You deserve to be happy.

1684
01:11:02,834 --> 01:11:08,633
What about everything you
said before about sacrifice?

1685
01:11:08,767 --> 01:11:11,633
I was wrong.

1686
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:13,467
I'm sorry if I made you feel

1687
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:16,867
like Mom and Dad's happiness
was your responsibility.

1688
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,133
Shouldn't live your life

1689
01:11:18,266 --> 01:11:20,133
according to what
someone else wants.

1690
01:11:21,333 --> 01:11:23,633
They've done so much for us.

1691
01:11:23,767 --> 01:11:25,200
Yeah.

1692
01:11:25,333 --> 01:11:27,367
But you should
pursue your passion.

1693
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:31,467
And if that means venturing
out, then so be it.

1694
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,166
Mom and Dad will understand.

1695
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,533
Can we make this a tradition?

1696
01:11:37,667 --> 01:11:39,867
Every year, the McBride
sisters get together

1697
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,467
and really be honest
about their lives?

1698
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:46,133
I'd really like that.

1699
01:11:46,266 --> 01:11:47,734
Me too.

1700
01:11:47,867 --> 01:11:49,567
I really love you guys.

1701
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:50,800
Is it safe?

1702
01:11:51,934 --> 01:11:52,800
Yes, Colin.

1703
01:11:52,934 --> 01:11:53,900
I'll take it, I'll take it.

1704
01:11:54,934 --> 01:11:55,800
All right.

1705
01:11:55,934 --> 01:11:56,867
Little sis, paying the bill.

1706
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,967
- Thanks, Posy.
- Thanks, Posy.

1707
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:01,967
There's still one more thing
you need to take care of.

1708
01:12:04,433 --> 01:12:08,633
What are you going
to do about Luke?

1709
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:19,133
Oh.

1710
01:12:19,266 --> 01:12:20,567
Hey, Mom.

1711
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:22,500
Hey, are you okay?

1712
01:12:22,633 --> 01:12:25,300
Yes, I'm so sorry I ran out.

1713
01:12:25,433 --> 01:12:27,633
You didn't get to
do your presents

1714
01:12:27,767 --> 01:12:29,633
or your cake or anything.

1715
01:12:29,767 --> 01:12:33,133
The girls got into the cake,
so we all just joined in.

1716
01:12:33,266 --> 01:12:35,066
Can I get you girls some?

1717
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:36,300
- I'm okay.
- I'm okay.

1718
01:12:36,433 --> 01:12:37,667
I'm going to go
tuck the girls in.

1719
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:38,767
I love you.

1720
01:12:39,934 --> 01:12:41,133
I'll see you upstairs, hon.

1721
01:12:41,266 --> 01:12:42,734
Yeah, sure.

1722
01:12:42,867 --> 01:12:44,066
- Night, Mom.
- Night, sweetie.

1723
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:45,266
- Girls.
- Night, Dad.

1724
01:12:46,333 --> 01:12:49,400
Okay, come here.

1725
01:12:49,533 --> 01:12:53,066
So Luke and I had
a really good talk.

1726
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:54,667
We talked about the accident.

1727
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:56,900
Mom.

1728
01:12:57,033 --> 01:12:58,133
I can't tell you
what a relief it is

1729
01:12:58,266 --> 01:12:59,667
knowing he doesn't blame me.

1730
01:13:01,166 --> 01:13:03,367
It's like I can finally
see through this cloud

1731
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:06,300
that's been hanging over my
head for the past 25 years.

1732
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:10,800
Mom, that's so
much to carry around.

1733
01:13:10,934 --> 01:13:13,734
I think Luke is the
best birthday gift

1734
01:13:13,867 --> 01:13:15,400
I could have asked for.

1735
01:13:16,433 --> 01:13:19,867
We also talked about you.

1736
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,133
Now, I'm not playing matchmaker,

1737
01:13:22,266 --> 01:13:24,400
but I know his feelings
for you are genuine.

1738
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:32,633
Just I don't know how I
could ever trust him again.

1739
01:13:32,767 --> 01:13:36,033
Forgiveness is a good start.

1740
01:13:36,166 --> 01:13:39,033
You seem made for each other.

1741
01:13:39,166 --> 01:13:40,300
I've never seen two people

1742
01:13:40,433 --> 01:13:42,467
who loved the mountains
more than you do.

1743
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:47,633
It's your calling.

1744
01:13:47,767 --> 01:13:49,367
Look at me.

1745
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:54,967
The cafe will survive, honey.

1746
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:57,533
But you and Dad, you
have plans to retire.

1747
01:13:57,667 --> 01:13:59,367
If there's one thing
I've learned for sure,

1748
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:02,467
it's plans change.

1749
01:14:03,734 --> 01:14:07,100
You need to follow
your heart, Posy.

1750
01:14:07,233 --> 01:14:14,033
And if that leads you to the
peaks of Europe, then so be it.

1751
01:14:14,166 --> 01:14:15,433
Yeah, but you and Dad,

1752
01:14:15,567 --> 01:14:17,633
you guys didn't get a
chance to have that freedom.

1753
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:22,867
You need to
understand something.

1754
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:29,367
Our lives have been so
much richer because of you.

1755
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:32,633
Sometimes you find your calling,

1756
01:14:32,767 --> 01:14:37,767
but sometimes your
calling finds you.

1757
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:43,433
Raising you girls was ours.

1758
01:14:43,567 --> 01:14:47,867
Thank you.

1759
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,867
I was thinking.

1760
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,100
I could talk to Paul

1761
01:14:51,233 --> 01:14:53,367
about working from home
a couple of days a week.

1762
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:54,767
He's a reasonable guy.

1763
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:56,266
Don't hate me,

1764
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:58,600
but I have decided not to
go back to work for Corinna.

1765
01:14:58,734 --> 01:14:59,600
Oh.

1766
01:14:59,734 --> 01:15:00,834
I think I'm going to wait

1767
01:15:00,967 --> 01:15:02,367
for something
that's a better fit.

1768
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:05,834
And Hannah has said she'd
helped me find something.

1769
01:15:05,967 --> 01:15:07,767
Oh, wow.

1770
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:11,266
Why the change of heart?

1771
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:16,367
What started as
excitement, I don't know,

1772
01:15:18,567 --> 01:15:21,600
turned into anxiety.

1773
01:15:21,734 --> 01:15:23,667
Started to remember why I
was happy to leave there

1774
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:24,934
in the first place.

1775
01:15:25,967 --> 01:15:28,667
Good.

1776
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:29,867
But I think I'm going to try

1777
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,767
and work from home a
couple of days anyway.

1778
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:33,600
I mean, the girls aren't
going to be young forever

1779
01:15:33,734 --> 01:15:36,934
and I'd like to be around more.

1780
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:49,266
I'd like that.

1781
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:53,000
Hey, how's Posy?

1782
01:15:53,133 --> 01:15:54,600
Oh, she'll be fine.

1783
01:15:54,734 --> 01:15:55,700
She's tough.

1784
01:15:57,834 --> 01:15:59,533
You know, we talked.

1785
01:15:59,667 --> 01:16:00,834
Like really talked,

1786
01:16:00,967 --> 01:16:03,100
and having it out with
those two was like,

1787
01:16:03,233 --> 01:16:05,667
it was like getting a gift
I didn't know I needed.

1788
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:10,500
Yeah, those are the best kind.

1789
01:16:14,567 --> 01:16:18,834
I'm pregnant, Adam.

1790
01:16:37,367 --> 01:16:39,934
I'm going to be a dad?

1791
01:16:40,066 --> 01:16:42,333
Yeah, you're not disappointed?

1792
01:16:42,467 --> 01:16:45,100
Disappointed, what, that
we're going to have a family?

1793
01:16:46,367 --> 01:16:48,066
I couldn't be happier.

1794
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:49,500
I don't know,

1795
01:16:49,633 --> 01:16:50,500
we always said we weren't
going to have kids.

1796
01:16:50,633 --> 01:16:52,934
Yeah, well, things change.

1797
01:16:53,066 --> 01:16:54,667
They're gonna change a lot.

1798
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:56,667
You're not worried?

1799
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,367
Hey, do I look worried?

1800
01:16:59,633 --> 01:17:00,567
Little bit.

1801
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:01,967
Do I?

1802
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:03,066
Little bit?

1803
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:05,900
I love you.

1804
01:17:06,033 --> 01:17:09,834
I love you.

1805
01:17:17,433 --> 01:17:19,300
The end.

1806
01:17:19,433 --> 01:17:20,400
One more?

1807
01:17:21,967 --> 01:17:24,967
And then you promise
you'll go to bed?

1808
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:29,834
Okay, go pick one.

1809
01:17:29,967 --> 01:17:31,834
What do we have here?

1810
01:17:31,967 --> 01:17:34,734
Oh, yes.

1811
01:17:34,867 --> 01:17:36,467
Do you know that Hannah
used to read this

1812
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:39,233
to Posy and me when
we were your age?

1813
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:44,567
Hey, I just wanted
to say good night.

1814
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:46,900
Will you read with us?

1815
01:17:47,033 --> 01:17:48,500
Is there room?

1816
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:52,500
Get in here.

1817
01:17:52,633 --> 01:17:54,000
Wow, you're still up.

1818
01:17:54,133 --> 01:17:57,066
Yeah, we're just about to
read our favorite bedtime story.

1819
01:17:58,600 --> 01:17:59,567
Come on, we'll make room.

1820
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:03,000
I would love to, but girls,

1821
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:09,033
there was somebody that was
just sitting in the hall.

1822
01:18:09,166 --> 01:18:13,700
The fairies heard our wishes!

1823
01:18:13,834 --> 01:18:16,467
They sure did.

1824
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:18,700
Thank you.

1825
01:18:18,834 --> 01:18:23,467
Of course.

1826
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:30,900
You mind?

1827
01:18:31,033 --> 01:18:32,734
Do I mind?

1828
01:18:32,867 --> 01:18:33,834
All right, girls.

1829
01:18:37,033 --> 01:18:37,900
You ready?

1830
01:18:38,033 --> 01:18:39,066
Yeah.

1831
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:40,533
Okay.

1832
01:18:40,667 --> 01:18:43,000
"There was once a
velveteen rabbit

1833
01:18:44,533 --> 01:18:47,633
"and in the beginning
he was really splendid.

1834
01:18:47,767 --> 01:18:51,900
"He was fat and punchy
as a rabbit should be."

1835
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,700
Hey.

1836
01:19:06,734 --> 01:19:09,266
I didn't think
I'd see you again.

1837
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:12,367
Yeah, well,

1838
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:15,367
my mom said something last
night about forgiveness

1839
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:17,600
and I put myself in your shoes

1840
01:19:17,734 --> 01:19:21,900
and it turns out they
feel a lot like my shoes.

1841
01:19:23,834 --> 01:19:26,800
Guess we share a tragedy.

1842
01:19:26,934 --> 01:19:30,266
Yeah.

1843
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:35,033
I'm really sorry you
lost your parents, Luke.

1844
01:19:35,166 --> 01:19:39,367
You had every
right to be upset.

1845
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:42,767
Luke, I have to ask,
if I hadn't found out,

1846
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:44,400
were you ever going to tell me?

1847
01:19:46,667 --> 01:19:51,867
My intention was to research
the accident for the book,

1848
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,266
but then everything changed.

1849
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,767
I fell in love with this place.

1850
01:19:56,900 --> 01:20:02,367
The mountains, your family.

1851
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:06,266
I fell in love with you.

1852
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:07,934
Every time I worked up
the courage to tell you,

1853
01:20:08,066 --> 01:20:11,033
I would talk myself out of it

1854
01:20:11,166 --> 01:20:13,900
because I didn't want to risk
ruining our relationship.

1855
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:21,100
I'm sorry.

1856
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:26,200
I don't blame you if you never
want to talk to me again.

1857
01:20:31,233 --> 01:20:35,633
I accept your apology.

1858
01:20:35,767 --> 01:20:37,767
Hey, I have to get
back to the house.

1859
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:39,300
Call it Mom's birthday 2.0.

1860
01:20:41,834 --> 01:20:45,433
Do you want to join?

1861
01:20:45,567 --> 01:20:46,700
Are you sure?

1862
01:20:46,834 --> 01:20:48,033
Say yes before
I change my mind.

1863
01:20:49,166 --> 01:20:51,633
Yes.

1864
01:20:57,667 --> 01:21:00,600
One, two,
three, open your eyes!

1865
01:21:00,734 --> 01:21:02,000
Surprise!

1866
01:21:07,467 --> 01:21:09,266
Come here, we have
a chair for you.

1867
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:11,600
Sit down, sit down, here you go.

1868
01:21:11,734 --> 01:21:15,000
So since last night
got cut a little short,

1869
01:21:15,133 --> 01:21:17,100
we thought we would
try this again.

1870
01:21:17,233 --> 01:21:18,834
You guys.

1871
01:21:18,967 --> 01:21:21,700
This is from me,
Beth, and Hannah.

1872
01:21:21,834 --> 01:21:23,767
Oh, girls, you spoil me.

1873
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:31,100
Oh.

1874
01:21:31,233 --> 01:21:33,834
I love it.

1875
01:21:33,967 --> 01:21:36,367
It's going on the mantle.

1876
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:38,333
Look, honey.

1877
01:21:38,467 --> 01:21:40,600
Thank you.

1878
01:21:40,734 --> 01:21:44,433
Okay, Adam and I have a
little something for you.

1879
01:21:44,567 --> 01:21:45,934
Actually, it's for both of you.

1880
01:21:46,066 --> 01:21:47,033
Okay.

1881
01:21:50,133 --> 01:21:54,500
"Dear Mom, surprise!

1882
01:21:54,633 --> 01:21:57,867
"Baby on the way."

1883
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,667
Are you kidding me?

1884
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:00,734
Oh, honey!

1885
01:22:08,033 --> 01:22:08,900
Are they crying?

1886
01:22:09,033 --> 01:22:10,567
These are happy tears, honey.

1887
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:13,066
We're going to be
grandparents again.

1888
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:15,500
Your Auntie Hannah
is having a baby.

1889
01:22:15,633 --> 01:22:18,166
You and Ruby are going to
have a little cousin soon.

1890
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:23,400
Congratulations on
becoming an aunt, again.

1891
01:22:23,533 --> 01:22:24,500
Thanks.

1892
01:22:26,033 --> 01:22:29,667
Thanks for coming in here
and disrupting our lives.

1893
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:31,000
If the offer still stands,

1894
01:22:31,133 --> 01:22:33,734
I would love to go to
Switzerland with you.

1895
01:22:33,867 --> 01:22:35,433
Nothing would make me happier.

1896
01:22:43,734 --> 01:22:49,734
All right, I would
like to propose a toast.

1897
01:22:49,867 --> 01:22:52,934
To family.

1898
01:22:53,066 --> 01:22:58,400
Even the ones who aren't with
us who we miss every day.

1899
01:22:58,533 --> 01:23:02,233
Michelle and Jerry gave
us the gift of a lifetime.

1900
01:23:02,367 --> 01:23:06,567
You three beautiful girls.

1901
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:08,900
Thank you.

1902
01:23:09,033 --> 01:23:09,967
Cheers!

1903
01:23:10,100 --> 01:23:11,400
Cheers.

1904
01:23:11,533 --> 01:23:13,000
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1905
01:23:14,934 --> 01:23:17,567
Cheers, Grandpa.

1906
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:19,133
- Let's hug it out.
- Okay.

1907
01:23:19,266 --> 01:23:20,667
Get over here, girls!

1908
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:21,767
Oh.

1909
01:23:22,967 --> 01:23:25,233
Happy birthday, Mom.

1910
01:23:25,367 --> 01:23:28,834
I love you girls.
