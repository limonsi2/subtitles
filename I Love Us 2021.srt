- [Sammy] "I Love Us."

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,860
When I first heard those words,

7
00:00:34,947 --> 00:00:36,166
I thought they were
the corniest three little words

8
00:00:36,253 --> 00:00:38,342
I ever heard in my life.

9
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:40,779

10
00:00:42,216 --> 00:00:43,391
- I love it.

11
00:00:43,478 --> 00:00:45,480
- [Sammy] I love us,
who says that?

12
00:00:45,567 --> 00:00:47,699
- I know it's not much, but--

13
00:00:47,786 --> 00:00:49,875
- I don't need a ring
to know how you feel.

14
00:00:49,962 --> 00:00:51,834
I don't need anything.

15
00:00:51,921 --> 00:00:54,010
That look in your eyes
says it all.

17

18

- If you would have
told me five years ago,

19
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:01,931
those three little words would
be the most important words

20
00:01:02,018 --> 00:01:04,325
in my life one day,
I would have told you

21
00:01:04,412 --> 00:01:05,456
three other little words.

Well, technically four.

I'm just saying, Sammy.

25

This fucking guy should've
been closed an hour ago.

love birds to split.

been in and out already.

of the business, Richie.

He's an associate.

Everybody loves boxes.

birthdays or Christmas.

362
00:17:21,257 --> 00:17:23,694
This is a good lead.
Take a lock.

363
00:17:23,781 --> 00:17:25,608
Stake it out,
take Richie with you.

364
00:17:25,695 --> 00:17:27,133
- No, no, no, no,
I don't like Richie.

365
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,352
- What's with you and liking
all of a sudden, huh?

366
00:17:29,439 --> 00:17:31,963
You don't have to like him,
all right?

367
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,487
You don't have to go camping
with the guy.

368
00:17:33,574 --> 00:17:35,271
You sit in the back seat,
I told you.

369
00:17:35,358 --> 00:17:37,360
- I do. He doesn't stop
asking questions.

370
00:17:37,447 --> 00:17:40,581
- Well then,
stop answering them then, huh?

371
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:44,150
- It's very easy to say.
The guy is unbelievable.

372
00:17:44,237 --> 00:17:48,632
- Look, I told you that I'm
gonna look out for you, right?

373
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:51,113
You bang out a few more jobs,

374
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,594
you'll be square with Ira
before you know it.

375
00:17:53,681 --> 00:17:55,639
- I know, Pops. I appreciate it.
I really do.

376
00:17:55,726 --> 00:17:57,859
It's just,
I can't lie to Laura anymore.

377
00:17:57,946 --> 00:17:58,686
- Lying?

378
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,993
You tell her you work here,
right?

379
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,647
- Yeah, I tell her I work here,
but...

380
00:18:03,734 --> 00:18:07,434
- Well, then... [laughs]
get to work.

381
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:09,088
- I can't lie to her.

382
00:18:09,175 --> 00:18:11,220
I can't lie to those girls.
I mean, it's...

383
00:18:11,394 --> 00:18:13,266
It's my life now, you know?

384
00:18:13,353 --> 00:18:16,747
- Sammy, I know that
we throw the word job

385
00:18:16,834 --> 00:18:18,401
around here a lot, okay?

386
00:18:18,488 --> 00:18:22,666
But this isn't what you do.
It's who you are.

387
00:18:22,753 --> 00:18:24,277
You want some more advice?

388
00:18:24,364 --> 00:18:25,495
- No, please.

389
00:18:25,582 --> 00:18:27,410
- Just tell her.

390
00:18:27,497 --> 00:18:29,108
You want that life?

391
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:31,371
You got to come clean.

392
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,242
You build it on a foundation
of bullshit,

393
00:18:33,329 --> 00:18:35,026
that life will come tumbling
down one day,

394
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,203
right on top of your head,

395
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:40,249
and you won't be able to
do a damn thing about it

396
00:18:40,336 --> 00:18:42,382
except try to take the hit.

397
00:18:43,731 --> 00:18:45,559
- I guess, I don't know.

398
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:49,693
[Sammy sighing]

399
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,130
I don't know, Pops.

400
00:18:53,393 --> 00:18:55,308
Growing up,
I didn't need a friend either,

401
00:18:55,395 --> 00:18:56,918
but as far as fathers go,

402
00:18:57,005 --> 00:19:00,226
mine definitely made
a better boss.

403
00:19:00,313 --> 00:19:01,705
The name he just dropped,

404
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:04,665
is why my posture is
so fucked up these days.

405
00:19:04,752 --> 00:19:07,581
[techno music]

406
00:19:07,668 --> 00:19:08,886
Ira Prince.

407
00:19:08,973 --> 00:19:10,061
Great guy,

408
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,065
but Ira always had one hand
in someone's pocket

409
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:18,461
and another wrapped gently
around their throats

410
00:19:18,548 --> 00:19:21,072
and his grip never felt tighter.

411
00:19:22,813 --> 00:19:24,075
I was a gambler.
Yes!

412
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,512
A good one.
Yes! Yes!

413
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:28,341
Which means I was also
a bad one.

414
00:19:28,428 --> 00:19:32,475
When I would hit, I would live
it up like a goddamn king.

415
00:19:32,562 --> 00:19:36,262
[upbeat music]
[ladies giggling]

416
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:39,482
But when I got hit, you've
never seen a sorer loser.

417
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:41,310
I hate this... [indistinct].

418
00:19:41,397 --> 00:19:43,094
One day I got hit really bad

419
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:48,056
and I not only lost my money,
I lost my friends' money

420
00:19:48,143 --> 00:19:51,668
and I lost Ira's money.

421
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,976
Ira and my dad go way back,
so as a favor to him,

422
00:19:55,063 --> 00:19:57,761
he took it easy on me.

423
00:19:57,848 --> 00:20:01,200
He agreed to let me pay
him back in installments.

424
00:20:01,287 --> 00:20:03,637
They say that if you do
something for 10,000 hours,

425
00:20:03,724 --> 00:20:05,726
you become a professional,
right?

426
00:20:05,813 --> 00:20:08,250
Well, I became
a fucking professional.

427
00:20:08,337 --> 00:20:10,818
[upbeat music]

428
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,260
[car door clunking]

429
00:20:18,347 --> 00:20:19,957
What do we got?

430
00:20:20,044 --> 00:20:22,133
- Now, why do you have
to seat in the back seat

431
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,310
like I'm your fucking chauffeur?

432
00:20:24,397 --> 00:20:27,530
- Technically, that's what
you are now.

433
00:20:27,617 --> 00:20:29,706
- Technically an asshole
is what you are.

434
00:20:29,793 --> 00:20:31,534
What do we have Richie?
What's going on over here?

435
00:20:31,621 --> 00:20:33,754
Explain to me, please.

436
00:20:33,841 --> 00:20:35,451
I never liked pawn shops.

437
00:20:35,538 --> 00:20:37,801
There's always one idiot
that wants to play the hero.

438
00:20:37,888 --> 00:20:40,848
- That chubby over there,
he comes out for a smoke break

439
00:20:40,935 --> 00:20:44,330
about every 15 minutes.
He's got a partner inside.

440
00:20:44,417 --> 00:20:46,157
That guy comes out at the end
of the day though, all right?

441
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,334
- If I want to put this life
behind me,

442
00:20:48,421 --> 00:20:51,728
I gotta stop thinking small time
and start thinking big time.

443
00:20:51,815 --> 00:20:53,556
- [cellphone buzzes]
- Hey, sweetie.

444
00:20:53,643 --> 00:20:55,602
- [Laura] Um, did you forget
that we have dinner tonight?

445
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:57,865
- Oh, shit. No, no, no,
uh, I didn't forget.

446
00:20:57,952 --> 00:20:59,562
[Laura] You know that I said
dinner at seven

447
00:20:59,649 --> 00:21:01,999
with the girls, right?
- [Sammy] Laura, I promise.

448
00:21:02,086 --> 00:21:04,175
- [Laura] Okay, I love you.
- I love you too, sweetie.

449
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,873
- [Laura] I'll see you soon.
- Okay.

450
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,744
- I'll be there in a little bit.
- [Laura] Okay, bye.

451
00:21:07,831 --> 00:21:10,878
- Okay, bye. Yo, I gotta go.

452
00:21:10,965 --> 00:21:12,314
Listen, you're doing
a great job.

453
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:14,185
Keep an eye on them,
and I'll see you tomorrow.

454
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,752
- I thought I was just a driver.

455
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:17,450
- You are just a driver, Richie.

[insects chirping]

458
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,019
This was it.

459
00:21:22,106 --> 00:21:25,849
Time to decide if I play
the friend card or the dad card.

460
00:21:25,936 --> 00:21:27,808
As long as I didn't play
the vomit card.

461

[insects chirping]

462
00:21:30,854 --> 00:21:34,205
- We're, like, really mean
to him and that's why--

463
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,337
- Dude, how old are you?

464
00:21:36,991 --> 00:21:39,254
- Hey.
- Hey.

- Good.

- Hi, girls.
- Hi.

468
00:21:48,263 --> 00:21:49,917
- What's with the teddy bear?

469
00:21:50,004 --> 00:21:52,093
- We're having a Teddy talk.

470
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,748
- Shit, I was playing with
the wrong fucking deck.

471
00:21:54,835 --> 00:21:56,053
A Teddy talk?

472
00:21:57,098 --> 00:21:59,796
- Yeah, Teddy.

473
00:22:00,536 --> 00:22:04,061
He helps us get things
off our chests in a safe

and controlled manner.

475
00:22:07,978 --> 00:22:12,896
Also helps us, you know,
with big family announcements.

476
00:22:13,201 --> 00:22:14,768
- Are we gonna go
to Disneyland?

477
00:22:14,855 --> 00:22:16,030
- Audrey, shut up.

478
00:22:16,117 --> 00:22:18,859
- No, we're not going
to Disneyland.

479
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:22,863
Um...

480
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,604
[sighs]

481
00:22:24,691 --> 00:22:25,387
Listen, um...

482
00:22:28,782 --> 00:22:31,959
I know the last few years, uh,
have been tough.

483
00:22:34,483 --> 00:22:38,313
Well, I've been thinking,
and I've--

484
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,097
- What your mom is trying
to say is--

485
00:22:40,184 --> 00:22:41,403
- Shh!
- This is so dumb.

486
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,362
- Shh!

487
00:22:43,449 --> 00:22:45,973
- You're not allowed to
talk unless you have Teddy.

488
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:49,019
I'm so sorry. That will
never happen again, please.

right?

Without being interrupted.

00:22:54,547 --> 00:22:59,508
Anyways, um, Sammy and I,
we have been talking and...

492
00:23:01,292 --> 00:23:03,338
He's my husband now, so--

493
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:05,384
- Why are you being so weird?

494
00:23:05,471 --> 00:23:06,776
- I'm not being weird.

495
00:23:06,863 --> 00:23:08,038
- [Rachel] You're being
really weird.

496
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:10,171
- No.

497
00:23:10,258 --> 00:23:13,609
I'm not. I'm... What I'm trying
to say is Sammy and I,

498
00:23:13,696 --> 00:23:17,961
we've been talking,
and, well, I...

he's a part of our family now,

500
00:23:19,746 --> 00:23:23,358
and he's an important part,
and we want... we wanna know

501
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:28,232
what you feel about him, um,
becoming your father.

00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,284
- Is this a joke?

504
00:23:36,371 --> 00:23:39,069
- No, it's not a joke,
actually, Rach.

505
00:23:40,984 --> 00:23:43,204
- Mom, tell me you're joking.

506
00:23:44,988 --> 00:23:47,382
I wasn't either. I'm not.

You okay?

- I don't know.

517
00:24:28,684 --> 00:24:32,383
Maybe we should've waited
until we moved in together.

518
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:36,649
You know?
Ease them into it?

519
00:24:36,736 --> 00:24:38,389
- Yeah.

I mean, she misses her dad.

They both do. I get it.

00:24:45,005 --> 00:24:45,701
I'm not him.

to come in, so...

524
00:24:49,966 --> 00:24:52,360
we'll see what happens.

525
00:24:52,447 --> 00:24:55,450
Well, I made it through that
long ones.

526
00:24:57,887 --> 00:24:58,627
What?

527
00:24:58,714 --> 00:24:59,846
- Yeah, you are.

[giggles]

529
00:25:03,066 --> 00:25:03,893

[family cheering]

531
00:25:06,417 --> 00:25:07,549
Sometimes they started to
look up.

532
00:25:07,636 --> 00:25:10,030
- Ah, thank you.
- Well, I'll take it.

533
00:25:10,117 --> 00:25:11,553
- And we started to feel like

00:34:14,748 --> 00:34:15,531
- Sammy?

709
00:34:19,274 --> 00:34:20,014
Sammy.

710
00:34:23,713 --> 00:34:25,411
- Good morning.
- Hi.

711
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:40,078
Breakfast?

712
00:34:40,165 --> 00:34:42,428
- Mm-hmm.

713
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:44,212
- All right, sit down,
I'm coming.

714
00:34:44,299 --> 00:34:45,605
- Okay.

715
00:34:47,563 --> 00:34:50,914
[sighing]

716
00:35:01,751 --> 00:35:03,013
How'd you sleep?

717
00:35:04,928 --> 00:35:06,669
- [Audrey] It was okay.

718
00:35:08,889 --> 00:35:09,672
- Eggs?

719
00:35:11,413 --> 00:35:12,110
- Sure.

720
00:35:20,292 --> 00:35:22,120
- Where's your sister?

721
00:35:22,207 --> 00:35:23,817
- She's still asleep.

722
00:35:26,472 --> 00:35:28,300
- Scrambled okay?

723
00:35:28,387 --> 00:35:29,127
- Sure.

724
00:35:41,051 --> 00:35:41,791
Thank you.

725
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,672
- Breakfast?

726
00:35:52,759 --> 00:35:53,499
- Sure.

727
00:36:05,685 --> 00:36:08,122
So, I took the day off
from work.

728
00:36:08,209 --> 00:36:10,211
We can do anything
you guys want.

729
00:36:10,298 --> 00:36:12,822
[cellphone buzzing]

730
00:36:14,346 --> 00:36:16,086
- [Audrey]
Can we go to Disneyland?

731
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:19,307
- Okay, we got one
for Disneyland.

732
00:36:19,394 --> 00:36:20,961
What are you thinking?

733
00:36:21,048 --> 00:36:23,833
- How about the beach?
- Beach?

734
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,271
- Yeah, mom loved the beach.

735
00:36:26,358 --> 00:36:29,056
- She did?
- Yeah.

736
00:36:31,537 --> 00:36:34,844
- Audrey, can we take
a rain check on Disneyland?

737
00:36:34,931 --> 00:36:37,804
- Can I make the sandwiches?

738
00:36:37,891 --> 00:36:39,109
- Yeah.

739
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,373
Please make the sandwiches.

740
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,504
- Okay.

741
00:36:42,852 --> 00:36:44,289
[buzzing continues]
- All right, you guys...

742
00:36:44,376 --> 00:36:48,423
you guys eat up and, um...
[buzzing stops]

743
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:52,906
Eat up, and I'm gonna shower.
I'll just wash up.

744
00:36:52,993 --> 00:36:57,040
I went to bed so late.
All right, enjoy it.

745
00:37:07,355 --> 00:37:08,791
- [Audrey] You like my bear?

746
00:37:08,878 --> 00:37:10,184
- [Rachel] It's cute.

747
00:37:10,271 --> 00:37:12,360
- I told her that I hated
the beach.

748
00:37:12,447 --> 00:37:16,321
Couldn't stand the heat,
but I can see why she loved it.

749
00:37:16,408 --> 00:37:21,151
[ocean waves crushing]
[sea gulls cawing]

750
00:37:23,371 --> 00:37:25,068
How was it?

751
00:37:25,155 --> 00:37:26,722
- [Rachel] It's good,
it was cold.

752
00:37:26,809 --> 00:37:28,289
- [Audrey] Today, the water's
really cold.

753
00:37:28,376 --> 00:37:29,421
- It is?
- Yeah.

754
00:37:29,508 --> 00:37:31,597
- You guys hungry?
- [Rachel] Yeah.

755
00:37:31,684 --> 00:37:34,252
- Why don't you guys eat
something?

756
00:37:34,339 --> 00:37:36,036
- [Audrey] Thank you.

757
00:37:36,123 --> 00:37:37,429
- Thanks for making these.
- [Audrey] Yeah, of course.

758
00:37:37,516 --> 00:37:38,778
- They're really good.
I just had them.

759
00:37:38,865 --> 00:37:40,519
- [Audrey] Yeah?

760
00:37:40,606 --> 00:37:42,216
- [Rachel] Mom always said
you made the best sandwiches.

761
00:37:49,092 --> 00:37:52,879
- Ah, we should head back
in a little bit, right?

762
00:37:53,836 --> 00:37:56,448
[birds chirping]

763
00:37:57,884 --> 00:38:00,800
[car engine roaring]

764
00:38:17,817 --> 00:38:19,340
Guys, get in the house.

765
00:38:19,427 --> 00:38:20,689
- [Rachel] Who is that?

766
00:38:20,776 --> 00:38:22,604
- It's just a work thing.
Get in the house.

767
00:38:22,691 --> 00:38:24,606
Go straight to your room.

768
00:38:25,912 --> 00:38:26,826
Go ahead.

769
00:38:26,913 --> 00:38:28,001
[dramatic music]

770
00:38:28,088 --> 00:38:29,176
- Boss wants to see you.

771
00:38:29,263 --> 00:38:31,744
[dramatic music]

772
00:38:31,831 --> 00:38:35,661
- You know how long
I've been waiting here?

773
00:38:35,748 --> 00:38:37,489
A long fucking time,
that's how long.

774
00:38:37,576 --> 00:38:39,317
[car door closes]

775
00:38:39,404 --> 00:38:40,318
- I'm sorry.

776
00:38:43,233 --> 00:38:46,498
- Just, uh, busting your balls,
kid.

777
00:38:46,585 --> 00:38:48,717
I'm sorry for your loss.

778
00:38:48,804 --> 00:38:49,762
I really am.

779
00:38:52,504 --> 00:38:54,070
If anything you need, I, uh...

780
00:38:57,291 --> 00:38:58,292
- I'm okay, thank you.

781
00:38:58,379 --> 00:39:01,034
[dramatic music]

782
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:03,210
Cried yet?

783
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:05,125
- Cry?

784
00:39:06,779 --> 00:39:09,521
- You should find a spot.

785
00:39:09,608 --> 00:39:11,131
Just let it all out.

786
00:39:12,611 --> 00:39:14,917
Maybe in your car,
maybe in....

787
00:39:16,092 --> 00:39:17,180
in the shower.

788
00:39:17,267 --> 00:39:19,748
Showers are great for crying.

789
00:39:19,835 --> 00:39:22,447
[inhales sharply]

790
00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:25,841
Um...I asked, uh, Harvey, uh,

791
00:39:27,887 --> 00:39:32,413
for an update, and he told me
that he couldn't reach you.

792
00:39:34,284 --> 00:39:36,199
- Sorry about that. It's...

793
00:39:36,286 --> 00:39:38,724
I took the girls
to the beach to get some food,

794
00:39:38,811 --> 00:39:40,073
get some fresh air,

795
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,554
so I didn't pick up my phone.

796
00:39:42,641 --> 00:39:44,338
- Uh...

797
00:39:44,425 --> 00:39:45,252
listen...

798
00:39:47,602 --> 00:39:51,780
You take some time,
get your head straight,

799
00:39:51,867 --> 00:39:54,130
do what you need to do
and when you're ready,

800
00:39:54,217 --> 00:39:55,218
you'll get...

801
00:39:56,655 --> 00:39:57,569
Back to work.

802
00:39:57,656 --> 00:40:00,920
[dramatic music]

803
00:40:01,007 --> 00:40:01,921
- Thank you.

804
00:40:03,662 --> 00:40:04,402
- And, uh...

805
00:40:04,489 --> 00:40:07,143
[dramatic music]

806
00:40:08,884 --> 00:40:10,625
- No, no, I can't.
I can't take that.

807
00:40:10,712 --> 00:40:13,672
- Oh, come on. Come on.

808
00:40:13,759 --> 00:40:17,545
Get those kids
some pizza or something.

809
00:40:17,632 --> 00:40:18,894
- Okay.

810
00:40:18,981 --> 00:40:21,288
Gangsters are a funny breed.

811
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:23,725
Some of the nicest guys
you'll ever meet.

812
00:40:23,812 --> 00:40:25,988
You almost forget that
they're stone cold killers.

813
00:40:26,075 --> 00:40:26,902
- And, uh, Sammy...

814
00:40:29,078 --> 00:40:30,819
you stay reachable.

815
00:40:30,906 --> 00:40:32,299
- Yes, sir.

816
00:40:32,386 --> 00:40:33,866
Almost.

817
00:40:33,953 --> 00:40:35,433
[car door clunking]

818
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,303
- Go.

819
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,437
- Shut up! This is my bear.

820
00:40:39,524 --> 00:40:40,960
- So what if I cry?
- Shut up!

821
00:40:41,047 --> 00:40:43,571
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What's going on?!

822
00:40:43,658 --> 00:40:44,703
- She killed Teddy!
- What?

823
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:47,619
- It's a fucking toy, Audrey!
Grow up!

824
00:40:47,706 --> 00:40:49,621
- Give it to me.
Give me the teddy bear.

825
00:40:49,708 --> 00:40:51,144
What happened?

826
00:40:51,231 --> 00:40:52,362
- She's acting like
a fucking little kid!

827
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,929
Why are you taking her side?!

828
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,322
- Watch your mouth!
You're acting like it's your--

829
00:40:55,409 --> 00:40:58,499
Are you serious right now?!
What are you doing?!

830
00:40:58,586 --> 00:40:59,935
- I'm the one holding
the fucking bear!

831
00:41:00,022 --> 00:41:01,937
Both of you shut the fuck up!

832
00:41:02,024 --> 00:41:03,461
- Watch your language.
You're scaring your sister.

833
00:41:03,548 --> 00:41:05,506
Give me the teddy bear.
- She's my sister,

834
00:41:05,593 --> 00:41:07,377
not your daughter,
and you're not my father!

835
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,554
You'll never be my father!

836
00:41:11,512 --> 00:41:13,732
Did you really think
one picnic and one ice cream

837
00:41:13,819 --> 00:41:15,951
was gonna fucking
fix everything?!

838
00:41:16,038 --> 00:41:18,258
[dramatic music]

839
00:41:19,738 --> 00:41:21,783
- Give me the teddy bear, Rach.

840
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:23,959
- You're the reason
my mom's dead.

841
00:41:24,046 --> 00:41:25,047
- Rachel!

842
00:41:25,134 --> 00:41:27,572
[dramatic music]

843
00:41:28,703 --> 00:41:29,443
[door slams]

844
00:41:33,926 --> 00:41:35,754
- Can you fix him?

845
00:41:35,841 --> 00:41:38,583
[slow piano music]

846
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:43,370
- It's okay.

847
00:41:43,457 --> 00:41:46,242
[slow piano music]

848
00:42:00,213 --> 00:42:02,694
[slow piano music]

849
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:15,837
It's so crazy when someone's
gone, just like that,

850
00:42:15,924 --> 00:42:18,187
right off the face of
the earth,

851
00:42:18,274 --> 00:42:20,625
and all that's left are a bunch
of pictures in your phone

852
00:42:20,712 --> 00:42:22,627
and some shaky video footage.

853
00:42:22,714 --> 00:42:24,019
[slow piano music]

854
00:42:24,106 --> 00:42:25,543
[laughter]

855
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:31,592
God, I missed her.

856
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:34,421
[slow piano music]

857
00:42:49,305 --> 00:42:52,482
[doorbell chimes]

858
00:42:53,396 --> 00:42:55,616
The doorbell ringing this
early is either a delivery,

859
00:42:55,703 --> 00:42:57,966
Jehovah's Witness,
or bad news.

860
00:43:00,882 --> 00:43:01,927
[doorbell chimes]

861
00:43:02,014 --> 00:43:02,841
Yeah, I'm coming!

862
00:43:12,111 --> 00:43:13,765
This looked like bad news.

863
00:43:13,852 --> 00:43:14,983
- Mr. Silverman?

864
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:16,463
- Yeah.

865
00:43:19,292 --> 00:43:22,991
- Maria Campos,
Child Protective Services.

866
00:43:23,078 --> 00:43:27,213
Oh, that's my guy out there,
just in case.

867
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,171
- In case of what?

868
00:43:29,258 --> 00:43:30,477
- Just in case.

869
00:43:32,914 --> 00:43:34,437
- This is a joke, right?

870
00:43:34,524 --> 00:43:36,962
- This is not a joke,
Mr. Silverman.

871
00:43:37,049 --> 00:43:38,790
- The girls need
to come with us.

872
00:43:38,877 --> 00:43:40,139
I'll give you a minute to
get their things together

873
00:43:40,226 --> 00:43:42,141
and say your goodbyes.

874
00:43:43,011 --> 00:43:44,012
- No, no, no,
it's not happening.

875
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:45,579
Those are my girls in there.

876
00:43:45,666 --> 00:43:48,538
- Actually, they're not.
Until your case is finalized,

877
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,671
the girls need to stay
with family.

878
00:43:50,758 --> 00:43:52,847
This is happening.

879
00:43:52,934 --> 00:43:54,806
We'll schedule the evaluations
as soon as possible

880
00:43:54,893 --> 00:43:57,199
and get all of the paperwork
in order.

881
00:43:57,286 --> 00:44:00,550
Look, the best case scenario,
this is temporary.

882
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:04,163
- And the worst case scenario?

883
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:06,469
- Let's just see what happens.
- What happens?

884
00:44:06,556 --> 00:44:09,559
This woman coming into my house
talking about family, family.

885
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:12,258
I'm their family.
What other family do they have?

886
00:44:12,345 --> 00:44:13,868
I mean, where are
they gonna stay?

887
00:44:13,955 --> 00:44:15,174
Their grandmother lives
in a home.

888
00:44:15,261 --> 00:44:16,741
- I am not at liberty to say.

889
00:44:16,828 --> 00:44:18,133
- There was only one
other family member

890
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:19,700
I can think of at that moment.

891
00:44:19,787 --> 00:44:22,485
I mean, I was still a bit drunk,
but right in that moment,

892
00:44:22,572 --> 00:44:24,705
I had an idea.

893
00:44:24,792 --> 00:44:27,969
What if they--
What if they lived with family?

894
00:44:28,056 --> 00:44:29,536
- That's what I just said.
[laughs]

895
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,494
- No, no. What if they lived

896
00:44:31,581 --> 00:44:32,582
with family here in the house,
with me?

897
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,889
[dramatic music]

898
00:44:34,976 --> 00:44:38,458
- Um... Well, I mean, I guess
technically that--

899
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:42,941
- Technically is good then.
Technically is good.

900
00:44:43,028 --> 00:44:45,291
I gotta make a phone call.
Would you come in for a minute?

901
00:44:45,378 --> 00:44:46,596
- [Maria] Uh, okay.

902
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:49,338
- Can he stay out here?
- [Maria] Sure.

903
00:44:49,425 --> 00:44:50,992
- Okay, please, come.
Five minutes.

904
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:53,125
I just gotta call somebody.

905
00:44:56,911 --> 00:44:58,391
Is there anything I can get you?

906
00:44:58,478 --> 00:45:00,175
- No, please don't worry
about me. I'm good, thank you.

907
00:45:00,262 --> 00:45:01,481
- You sure? Okay, thank you.
- Yes.

908
00:45:01,568 --> 00:45:03,222
-[doorbell rings]
There he is.

909
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:12,318
- Hey.
- There's a huge guy on your--

910
00:45:12,405 --> 00:45:13,623
- I know, I know. Come inside.

911
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,408
I gotta introduce you
to someone.

912
00:45:15,495 --> 00:45:17,497
- Is this grass real?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on.

913
00:45:19,151 --> 00:45:19,847
Come, come, come.

914
00:45:22,502 --> 00:45:26,245
Ah, Maria, this is Rob Fenton.

915
00:45:26,332 --> 00:45:29,596
This is Maria Campos
from, uh, CPS.

916
00:45:29,683 --> 00:45:31,729
I was telling you on the phone.
- Hi, Mr. Fenton.

917
00:45:35,036 --> 00:45:37,909
- Would you like something
to drink? Uh...

918
00:45:37,996 --> 00:45:40,215
Want some orange juice?
I'll get you some orange juice.

919
00:45:42,957 --> 00:45:45,917
- Oh, God,
it looks different here.

920
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:50,312
- Freshly squeezed.

921
00:45:50,399 --> 00:45:53,751
[juice pouring]

922
00:45:57,537 --> 00:45:58,364
There you go.

923
00:46:00,801 --> 00:46:02,498
Rob, listen, Missus, uh, Miss--

924
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,763
- Miss.
- Miss Campos is here.

925
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:08,156
She's helping me
with the adoption papers.

926
00:46:08,243 --> 00:46:10,811
The only way the girls can
actually live here with me

927
00:46:10,898 --> 00:46:13,161
is if there's a family member
living here.

928
00:46:13,248 --> 00:46:14,162
- [Maria] That's correct.

929
00:46:14,249 --> 00:46:15,947
- Correct?
- Yes.

930
00:46:16,034 --> 00:46:18,340
- I mean, everyone's been
through so much,

931
00:46:18,427 --> 00:46:19,820
especially the girls.

932
00:46:19,907 --> 00:46:20,952
- Wow, that's really good juice.

933
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:22,344
- You like that orange juice?

934
00:46:22,431 --> 00:46:24,520
You can have as much
orange juice as you want.

935
00:46:24,607 --> 00:46:26,218
- But I already have a place.

936
00:46:26,305 --> 00:46:28,089
- Yeah, but this is
just a couple of weeks.

937
00:46:28,176 --> 00:46:30,613
- Yeah, maybe more,

938
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:34,182
and if the papers go through,
you know, it's a process.

939
00:46:34,269 --> 00:46:35,749
- If the paperwork goes through.

940
00:46:35,836 --> 00:46:37,359
Well, I'm sure
it's gonna go through, right?

941
00:46:37,446 --> 00:46:39,971
- We'll see. We just
take it one day at a time.

942
00:46:40,058 --> 00:46:41,189
- So it's temporary?

943
00:46:41,276 --> 00:46:43,278
- It's definitely temporary.

944
00:46:43,583 --> 00:46:44,932
[door knob clicking]

945
00:46:45,019 --> 00:46:46,455
- [Audrey] Uncle Rob?

946
00:46:46,542 --> 00:46:49,894
- [Rob] Hey, look at you.

947
00:46:49,981 --> 00:46:52,113
How you doing?
Oh, my God!

948
00:46:53,027 --> 00:46:54,681
- [Audrey]
What are you doing here?

949
00:46:54,768 --> 00:46:55,943
- I invited your uncle
for breakfast.

950
00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:58,641
- Yeah, I'm having orange juice.

951
00:46:58,728 --> 00:46:59,817
- Teddy's dead.

952
00:47:01,122 --> 00:47:04,125
- [Maria] What?
- Teddy's dead.

953
00:47:04,212 --> 00:47:05,344
- Who's Teddy?
- It's just...

954
00:47:06,345 --> 00:47:07,607
- It's nothing,
it's a teddy bear.

955
00:47:07,694 --> 00:47:09,435
- Ah, honey,
can you do me a favor?

956
00:47:09,522 --> 00:47:11,829
Can you give please give us
a minute?

957
00:47:11,916 --> 00:47:14,222
- We'll hang out, okay?
See you.

958
00:47:15,615 --> 00:47:16,529
[whispers] She's so big.

959
00:47:17,399 --> 00:47:19,401
- Uh, so we're good?

960
00:47:23,623 --> 00:47:25,233
- Yeah, we're good.

961
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:28,323
- Well, I just have to
update your paperwork,

962
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:30,499
but we should be good,

963
00:47:30,586 --> 00:47:33,111
and I'll have to run a quick
background check on Mr. Fenton.

964
00:47:33,198 --> 00:47:35,330
- Background check?
- Yes.

965
00:47:35,417 --> 00:47:37,115
We'll keep in touch,
Mr. Silverman.

966
00:47:37,202 --> 00:47:38,203
- [Sammy] Uh, Silver.

967
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:40,031
- Right.

968
00:47:40,118 --> 00:47:41,989
- Okay, thank you.
So, you'll call me?

969
00:47:42,076 --> 00:47:42,947
- I will.

970
00:47:43,034 --> 00:47:44,078
- Okay, great.

971
00:47:45,471 --> 00:47:47,777
I worked very hard to stay clean
on paper.

972
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:50,563
You look me up anywhere and
I'm basically squeaky clean,

973
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:51,912
but this guy...

974
00:47:51,999 --> 00:47:53,696
You're clean?

975
00:47:53,783 --> 00:47:55,524
- Yeah. I got allergies.

976
00:47:55,611 --> 00:47:57,657
- Allergies?
- That's why I'm sniffing.

977
00:47:57,744 --> 00:47:59,267
- Okay, good.
- Yeah.

978
00:47:59,354 --> 00:48:01,791
- Rachel! Your uncle's here!
- Rachel's here?

979
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:04,838
- Yeah, sit,
I'll tell you everything.

980
00:48:04,925 --> 00:48:07,667
- Uncle Rob.
- [laughs]

981
00:48:07,754 --> 00:48:09,234
- What are you doing here?

982
00:48:09,321 --> 00:48:11,018
- [Rob] I'm hanging.

983
00:48:11,584 --> 00:48:13,325
- [both] Brr! [laughing]

984
00:48:13,412 --> 00:48:14,804
You'll get it next time.

985
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,241
- What are you doing here?

986
00:48:16,328 --> 00:48:17,982
- Hanging out, yeah.

987
00:48:18,069 --> 00:48:19,331
- [Sammy] Your uncle's gonna
live with us.

988
00:48:19,418 --> 00:48:21,289
- Really?
- For a little bit, yeah.

989
00:48:21,376 --> 00:48:23,988
- Oh, that's awesome.
I'm gonna go brush my teeth.

990
00:48:24,075 --> 00:48:26,033
- Okay.
I wasn't gonna say anything.

991
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,513
- [Sammy] All right.

992
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:28,993
- [Rachel] Shut up.

993
00:48:32,344 --> 00:48:34,259
- It's crazy how much
she looks like her.

994
00:48:34,346 --> 00:48:35,564
- It's crazy. Hey...

995
00:48:35,651 --> 00:48:39,307
I really appreciate
you doing this.

996
00:48:39,394 --> 00:48:41,048
It means a lot.

997
00:48:41,135 --> 00:48:42,920
- I'd do anything for them.
- I know.

998
00:48:45,183 --> 00:48:46,836
I'll get you set up.

999
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,403
If you need anything,
just let me know.

1000
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:49,578
- [Rob] Okay.
- All right?

1001
00:48:49,665 --> 00:48:52,973
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you. Appreciate it.

1002
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:54,975
All I knew about Rob is
that he loved his sister,

1003
00:48:55,062 --> 00:48:57,064
and she loved him.

1004
00:48:57,151 --> 00:48:59,762
Now I gotta go hide
all my valuables.

1005
00:48:59,849 --> 00:49:01,939
- You guys got any coffee?

1006
00:49:04,724 --> 00:49:07,031
What? No?

1007
00:49:07,422 --> 00:49:09,468
- Yeah, black okay?

1008
00:49:09,555 --> 00:49:10,556
- Please.

1009
00:49:14,473 --> 00:49:17,389
[coffee pouring]

1010
00:49:17,476 --> 00:49:19,304
You guys don't eat ever?

1011
00:49:24,352 --> 00:49:26,833
[mug clunks]

1012
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:31,359
[dramatic music]

1013
00:49:31,446 --> 00:49:33,144
God, Rachel.

1014
00:49:33,231 --> 00:49:35,233
It's crazy how much
you look like her.

1015
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,235
Sammy, right?

1016
00:49:37,322 --> 00:49:39,063
[dramatic music]

1017
00:49:40,151 --> 00:49:42,196
- Yeah, you really do.

1018
00:49:43,284 --> 00:49:45,460
- I'm not her.

1019
00:49:45,547 --> 00:49:48,463
- I know, I didn't...
I didn't mean it like that.

1020
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:50,291
- I know what you meant.

1021
00:49:51,945 --> 00:49:53,251
Audrey looks like Dad.

1022
00:49:55,209 --> 00:49:57,864
It's hard to forget someone
when you see them every day.

1023
00:49:57,951 --> 00:50:01,824
- Well, you're not supposed
to forget.

1024
00:50:01,911 --> 00:50:05,132
You're supposed to remember.
- Yeah, well, remembering sucks.

1025
00:50:05,219 --> 00:50:08,135
[dramatic music]

1026
00:50:08,222 --> 00:50:10,659
- I'm gonna make some coffee.

1027
00:50:10,746 --> 00:50:12,531
You guys want some, Rachel?

1028
00:50:12,792 --> 00:50:13,619
- No, I'm good.

1029
00:50:18,493 --> 00:50:21,670
- All right, movie marathon
tonight, yeah?

1030
00:50:21,757 --> 00:50:25,283
We stay up late,
popcorn, burping, farting.

1031
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:26,719
She's been farting all night,
so--

1032
00:50:26,806 --> 00:50:29,678
- No, that was Teddy's corpse.

1033
00:50:29,765 --> 00:50:31,245
- Teddy's?
- It's his ghost, yeah.

1034
00:50:32,681 --> 00:50:33,291
- Excuses.
- Mm-hmm.

1035
00:50:34,509 --> 00:50:36,250
- It's a school night

1036
00:50:36,337 --> 00:50:38,165
- School?

1037
00:50:38,252 --> 00:50:43,040
Don't you guys get, like,
time to grieve and stuff?

1038
00:50:44,302 --> 00:50:45,520
- No.

1039
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:47,305
- [Sammy] They missed
enough school already.

1040
00:50:47,392 --> 00:50:49,437
- It's one more day, Sammy.

1041
00:50:49,524 --> 00:50:51,178
What's the difference?

1042
00:50:52,397 --> 00:50:54,660
- Can we, please?

1043
00:50:55,574 --> 00:50:57,097
- What a nightmare.

1044
00:50:57,228 --> 00:50:59,969
I was trying to move a few steps
forward with these kids,

1045
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,319
and he was knocking me
10 steps back

1046
00:51:01,406 --> 00:51:04,148
every time he opened his mouth.

1047
00:51:04,235 --> 00:51:06,541
You guys can do marathon night
on the weekend.

1048
00:51:06,628 --> 00:51:09,066
- How about that?
- This weekend?

1049
00:51:09,153 --> 00:51:11,546
It's like Tuesday.
- Whatever.

1050
00:51:11,633 --> 00:51:14,027
- But I had an Ace up my sleeve.

1051
00:51:14,114 --> 00:51:16,247
This should definitely work.

1052
00:51:19,815 --> 00:51:22,340
I really gotta stop drinking.

1053
00:51:27,606 --> 00:51:30,217
All right, here we are.

1054
00:51:30,304 --> 00:51:32,306
- You guys all set?
- Yeah.

1055
00:51:32,393 --> 00:51:34,003
All right, I'll pick
you guys up later,

1056
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,831
and we'll go have dinner
wherever you want.

1057
00:51:35,918 --> 00:51:37,355
- Okay.
- Okay.

1058
00:51:37,442 --> 00:51:38,443
- Bye, Sammy.

1059
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:39,444
- Bye, Audrey.

1060
00:51:44,013 --> 00:51:45,406
- You know, next time
you take us to school,

1061
00:51:45,493 --> 00:51:48,105
how about you drop us off
on time?

1062
00:51:48,192 --> 00:51:49,845
- [Sammy] Sorry.
- It's okay.

1063
00:51:52,152 --> 00:51:55,677
[cellphone buzzing]
- Yo.

1064
00:51:55,764 --> 00:51:57,375
- I've been calling you
for two days,

1065
00:51:57,462 --> 00:51:58,767
and this is how you answer, eh?

1066
00:51:58,854 --> 00:52:01,118
- I'm sorry. I'm just
so busy with these girls.

1067
00:52:01,205 --> 00:52:02,684
- No, no, I understand
that, son, all right?

1068
00:52:02,771 --> 00:52:05,252
But this is important,
all right?

1069
00:52:05,339 --> 00:52:07,863
We need to talk.
- About what?

1070
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:10,039
- Something big, Sammy.

1071
00:52:10,997 --> 00:52:11,780
- Okay.

1072
00:52:13,304 --> 00:52:15,088
All right, give me like
30 minutes.

1073
00:52:16,045 --> 00:52:19,048
[sighs]

1074
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,578
- [Harvey] Hey.
- Hey.

1075
00:52:30,886 --> 00:52:31,974
How you doing?

1076
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:36,370
You got me rushing over here.

1077
00:52:41,114 --> 00:52:44,900
- You know how you make
the perfect cup of tea?

1078
00:52:44,987 --> 00:52:46,641
- [Sammy] What?

1079
00:52:46,728 --> 00:52:48,121
- Timing.

1080
00:52:50,993 --> 00:52:52,212
Go ahead and open it.

1081
00:52:52,299 --> 00:52:53,909
- What is it?

1082
00:52:53,996 --> 00:52:55,694
- [Harvey] You'll see.

1083
00:52:58,262 --> 00:53:00,307
Omar Al Said.

1084
00:53:00,394 --> 00:53:02,048
- I don't know who that is.

1085
00:53:02,266 --> 00:53:03,528
- You're not supposed to know
who he is.

1086
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:05,312
What you need to know
is what he has

1087
00:53:05,399 --> 00:53:07,358
hanging on his walls.

1088
00:53:09,142 --> 00:53:11,013
That piece sold to
an anonymous buyer last year

1089
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:13,538
for a little over $50 mil,
all right?

1090
00:53:13,625 --> 00:53:16,628
The art world is crawling
with rich lunatics,

1091
00:53:16,715 --> 00:53:18,978
and I got one ready
to take that off our hands

1092
00:53:19,065 --> 00:53:20,632
once it is in our hands.

1093
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:23,852
- $50 million.
What's our take?

1094
00:53:23,939 --> 00:53:29,293
- I haven't figured it all out
yet, but it's gonna be big.

1095
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:32,339
- I'm sure a guy like that has
a lot of security with him.

1096
00:53:32,426 --> 00:53:33,993
- Mm. Well, stake it out,
all right?

1097
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,995
See what your balls say.

1098
00:53:36,082 --> 00:53:37,562
There's always a way
around them, you know?

1099
00:53:37,649 --> 00:53:38,998
Always is.

1100
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:42,393
- I hated to admit it,
but the old man was right.

1101
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,004
This could be the job
to end all jobs.

1102
00:53:45,091 --> 00:53:47,354
The take could be $5 million
easy,

1103
00:53:47,441 --> 00:53:49,965
but bigger paydays
come with bigger risks.

1104
00:53:52,403 --> 00:53:53,708
- Oh, it's terrible.

1105
00:53:53,795 --> 00:53:57,582
- Yeah, of course.
You waited too long, huh?

1106
00:53:58,974 --> 00:54:00,933
You now, your mother got me
into tea.

1107
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:03,718
I was a pure coffee guy
when we met.

1108
00:54:03,805 --> 00:54:05,720
Black, no fucking around.

1109
00:54:07,853 --> 00:54:10,551
Yeah, she changed me
in many ways,

1110
00:54:10,638 --> 00:54:12,945
and some things
she couldn't change.

1111
00:54:13,032 --> 00:54:14,425
- Pop, let me ask you,

1112
00:54:14,512 --> 00:54:16,601
how did you ever tell her
about the business?

1113
00:54:16,731 --> 00:54:18,994
- I didn't. She found out.

1114
00:54:19,081 --> 00:54:20,953
- Wait, I thought you told her.
That's why she left.

1115
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,302
- No, she found out.

1116
00:54:22,389 --> 00:54:24,870
She was more hurt
that I didn't tell her

1117
00:54:24,957 --> 00:54:29,309
what I was doing than
she was about what I was doing.

1118
00:54:29,396 --> 00:54:30,832
You know, Sammy, once trust
goes out the door,

1119
00:54:30,919 --> 00:54:33,487
everything else follows.

1120
00:54:33,574 --> 00:54:34,880
- You never thought about
walking away?

1121
00:54:34,967 --> 00:54:36,621
- Oh, no.

1122
00:54:36,708 --> 00:54:38,144
This is all I know.

1123
00:54:39,667 --> 00:54:42,627
I never wanted you
to be part of this life,

1124
00:54:42,714 --> 00:54:46,239
but I didn't want to
hide it from you either,

1125
00:54:46,326 --> 00:54:49,460
and now this is all you know.

1126
00:54:52,158 --> 00:54:54,900
But you know you have
a choice to make now, son.

1127
00:54:57,598 --> 00:54:58,991
- I think I know.

1128
00:55:01,341 --> 00:55:03,952
This looks great, Dad.

1129
00:55:04,039 --> 00:55:07,304
- This, we pull off...

1130
00:55:07,391 --> 00:55:09,001
you don't have to worry.

1131
00:55:09,088 --> 00:55:12,352
We take care of those kids,
take care of Ira,

1132
00:55:12,439 --> 00:55:14,615
have the life you want.

1133
00:55:15,355 --> 00:55:18,315
- That's exactly what
I've been looking for.

1134
00:55:18,402 --> 00:55:22,362
I appreciate it, Pop. You always
look out for me, you really do.

1135
00:55:22,449 --> 00:55:23,842
Love you, Pop. Bye.

1136
00:55:23,929 --> 00:55:25,626
I'll take a look at this,
and I'll call you.

1137
00:55:25,713 --> 00:55:28,586
[dramatic music]

1138
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:39,074
[car engine roaring]
[dramatic music]

1139
00:55:50,477 --> 00:55:53,306
A gate is usually a good sign.

1140
00:55:53,393 --> 00:55:55,830
It means big house
with big money,

1141
00:55:55,917 --> 00:55:58,224
but it also means big trouble.

1142
00:56:00,661 --> 00:56:02,315
Getting on the other side
of that gate,

1143
00:56:02,402 --> 00:56:03,838
it's gonna be
a fucking nightmare.

1144
00:56:03,925 --> 00:56:06,319
[dramatic music]

1145
00:56:06,406 --> 00:56:08,234
Hello?
- [Principal] Mr. Silverman.

1146
00:56:08,321 --> 00:56:10,149
- What?

1147
00:56:10,236 --> 00:56:11,977
- [Principal] I need you to
come to the school right now.

1148
00:56:12,064 --> 00:56:12,934
- Okay, I'm coming.

1149
00:56:13,021 --> 00:56:16,329
[dramatic music]

1150
00:56:16,416 --> 00:56:21,160
[car engine roaring]
[dramatic music]

1151
00:56:22,988 --> 00:56:25,599
[dramatic music]

1152
00:56:30,648 --> 00:56:31,605
- Follow me.

1153
00:56:31,692 --> 00:56:34,303
[dramatic music]

1154
00:56:37,742 --> 00:56:39,004
- What exactly did she do?

1155
00:56:39,091 --> 00:56:40,658
- She vandalized
school property.

1156
00:56:40,745 --> 00:56:42,834
She broke into
the gym's equipment locker

1157
00:56:42,921 --> 00:56:46,881
and then punctured every single
one of the school's basketballs

1158
00:56:46,968 --> 00:56:48,274
with this.

1159
00:56:48,361 --> 00:56:51,016
Is this from your home,
Mr. Silverman?

1160
00:56:51,103 --> 00:56:53,061
- Yeah, that's mine.

1161
00:56:53,366 --> 00:56:56,151
- Normally, I would push
for immediate suspension

1162
00:56:56,238 --> 00:56:57,849
or even expulsion,

1163
00:56:57,936 --> 00:57:00,678
but considering
the recent tragic circumstances

1164
00:57:00,765 --> 00:57:01,940
and the fact that, Rachel,

1165
00:57:02,027 --> 00:57:04,246
you've always been
a fine student,

1166
00:57:04,333 --> 00:57:06,335
I'm gonna show
some leniency here.

1167
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:08,294
- Thank you.

1168
00:57:08,381 --> 00:57:10,775
- You'll be getting
a bill for all the damages.

1169
00:57:10,862 --> 00:57:12,472
It'll do some good for Rachel
to stay home

1170
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:16,041
for a couple more days,
and her sister, too.

1171
00:57:17,042 --> 00:57:18,739
- What does Audrey
have to do with this?

1172
00:57:18,826 --> 00:57:21,481
- They're hurting.
They need to stay home.

1173
00:57:21,568 --> 00:57:23,918
They need to take this all in.

1174
00:57:24,049 --> 00:57:26,268
- I know she knows better
than this,

1175
00:57:26,355 --> 00:57:29,054
but, um, just send me the bill,

1176
00:57:29,141 --> 00:57:31,926
and I'll take care of it,
and I really appreciate it.

1177
00:57:33,841 --> 00:57:35,887
- Can we please go home now?

1178
00:57:35,974 --> 00:57:36,757
- Yeah.

1179
00:57:39,107 --> 00:57:41,936
Thank you. I'm sorry.

1180
00:57:42,023 --> 00:57:43,677
It won't happen again.

1181
00:57:48,595 --> 00:57:50,945
Rach, why the basketballs?

1182
00:57:52,338 --> 00:57:55,254
- Yeah, why did you do that?
I thought you loved basketball.

1183
00:57:55,341 --> 00:57:57,212
- She does?
- Yeah.

1184
00:57:57,299 --> 00:57:59,954
- You do?
- Not anymore.

1185
00:58:00,041 --> 00:58:01,434
- You know how much trouble
you're in?

1186
00:58:01,521 --> 00:58:03,610
You know how much money
this is gonna cost me?

1187
00:58:03,697 --> 00:58:06,178
Do you have any idea how much
money it's gonna cost me?

1188
00:58:06,265 --> 00:58:07,527
- I honestly don't care.

1189
00:58:23,325 --> 00:58:24,065
[door slams]

1190
00:58:31,116 --> 00:58:32,552
- Straight to your room.

1191
00:58:38,558 --> 00:58:41,430
[ice cube clunking]

1192
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:47,393
Rob!

1193
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:52,485
The thing about ex junkies
is a nine out of 10,

1194
00:58:52,572 --> 00:58:55,053
their old habits never die.

1195
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:55,923
Rob?

1196
00:58:58,186 --> 00:59:00,537
It's just a matter of
opportunity and a matter of time

1197
00:59:00,624 --> 00:59:03,583
before history
starts repeating itself.

1198
00:59:14,986 --> 00:59:16,988
Hey, put your feet down.

1199
00:59:19,773 --> 00:59:21,209
What are you doing?

1200
00:59:22,428 --> 00:59:24,561
- Just, uh, I'm just regrouping.

1201
00:59:27,172 --> 00:59:28,695
- You high?

1202
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:33,352
Are you high?

1203
00:59:33,439 --> 00:59:36,007
- [exhaling]

1204
00:59:36,094 --> 00:59:37,574
I think I'm sunstroke.

1205
00:59:37,661 --> 00:59:39,053
I've been out here for hours.

1206
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:41,578
- Sunstroke?
- Yeah.

1207
00:59:41,665 --> 00:59:44,058
- Maybe it's your allergies,
huh?

1208
00:59:44,145 --> 00:59:47,279
- Yeah, I mean,
these trees, the flowers,

1209
00:59:47,366 --> 00:59:50,587
the pollens in the pool.
You know?

1210
00:59:51,109 --> 00:59:53,067
Could be it.

1211
00:59:53,154 --> 00:59:55,374
- CPS shows up, and they see
you high as a fucking kite,

1212
00:59:55,461 --> 00:59:57,506
what do you think
they're gonna do?

1213
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:59,030
The only reason these girls
get to live here

1214
00:59:59,117 --> 01:00:00,771
is because you're here.

1215
01:00:00,858 --> 01:00:02,599
What are you thinking?

1216
01:00:05,123 --> 01:00:06,733
- I didn't take that much.

1217
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:08,953
- You didn't take much.

1218
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:12,696
Well, I'm sorry
I'm overreacting here.

1219
01:00:12,783 --> 01:00:14,523
You want these girls
to see you like this?

1220
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,482
Cool Uncle Rob?

1221
01:00:16,569 --> 01:00:18,310
High as a fucking kite?

1222
01:00:20,181 --> 01:00:22,270
I don't want drugs
in this house, do you hear me?

1223
01:00:22,357 --> 01:00:24,098
I'm gonna fucking fix up
your nose and your pocket

1224
01:00:24,185 --> 01:00:25,534
and the living room.

1225
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:27,841
This is a no drug zone.
You can't follow those rules,

1226
01:00:27,928 --> 01:00:30,104
you need to get the fuck out.

1227
01:00:32,063 --> 01:00:32,803
Wake up.

1228
01:00:35,849 --> 01:00:37,242
Rachel!

1229
01:00:43,161 --> 01:00:45,598
- [Audrey] Good night.
- [Rachel] Good night.

1230
01:00:45,685 --> 01:00:47,382
Are we going to the movies
tomorrow like you promised?

1231
01:00:47,469 --> 01:00:49,515
- [Sammy] Yeah, yeah,
I swear, tomorrow.

1232
01:00:49,602 --> 01:00:51,430
- [Rachel] Promise?
- [Sammy] I promise.

1233
01:00:51,517 --> 01:00:53,084
- [Rachel] Okay.
- [Sammy] We'll do it tomorrow.

1234
01:00:53,171 --> 01:00:54,781
- [Audrey] All right.
- [Rachel] Good night.

1235
01:00:54,868 --> 01:00:56,217
- [Sammy] Goodnight.
- [Rachel] Good night.

1236
01:01:14,018 --> 01:01:15,236
- It's all gone.

1237
01:01:16,455 --> 01:01:17,282
I'm off it.

1238
01:01:18,892 --> 01:01:20,720
- Mazel Tov.

1239
01:01:24,071 --> 01:01:27,379
- You know, alcohol is a pretty
big vice, just saying.

1240
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:31,600
- It's better than crack.

1241
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,864
- Yeah, it's not crack.

1242
01:01:33,951 --> 01:01:35,169
Mind if I...

1243
01:01:36,518 --> 01:01:38,129
- Knock yourself out.

1244
01:01:39,434 --> 01:01:40,697
- Just a little.

1245
01:01:44,178 --> 01:01:45,789
[alcohol pouring]

1246
01:01:51,969 --> 01:01:55,276
Ooh. God,
I think I'll stick to crack.

1247
01:01:55,363 --> 01:01:57,626
[chuckles]

1248
01:01:58,627 --> 01:02:01,587
You know, my sister always knew
what to say.

1249
01:02:01,674 --> 01:02:05,243
She always knew what to do
to get me off that shit.

1250
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:11,205
With just a few words,
I'd be off it, cold turkey.

1251
01:02:13,294 --> 01:02:18,473
Till I wasn't, of course,
but she never gave up on me.

1252
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:20,606
She always stood by me,

1253
01:02:20,693 --> 01:02:24,262
and she'd say a few things
and I'd be off of it again.

1254
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:28,005
- Your sister was tired, Rob.

1255
01:02:29,397 --> 01:02:31,008
- Yeah, I know.

1256
01:02:31,095 --> 01:02:32,357
- I mean...

1257
01:02:34,011 --> 01:02:36,491
She tried everything.
You always came back.

1258
01:02:36,578 --> 01:02:38,189
You always went back.

1259
01:02:39,712 --> 01:02:42,149
- She was stronger than
all of us, right?

1260
01:02:43,629 --> 01:02:44,369
- Yeah.

1261
01:02:46,066 --> 01:02:48,025
Yes, she was.

1262
01:02:49,635 --> 01:02:50,462
- To Laura.

1263
01:02:54,379 --> 01:02:55,249
[clink]

1264
01:02:58,470 --> 01:03:01,560
[inhales, exhales]

1265
01:03:04,215 --> 01:03:05,956
I fucking miss her, man.

1266
01:03:12,701 --> 01:03:14,312
- Me too.

1267
01:03:21,754 --> 01:03:23,364
Those girls miss her.

1268
01:03:25,105 --> 01:03:26,846
- [Rob] Yeah, but you're
doing a good job with them.

1269
01:03:26,933 --> 01:03:27,934
You really are.

1270
01:03:28,021 --> 01:03:30,676
[dramatic music]

1271
01:03:31,764 --> 01:03:32,721
- I'm trying.

1272
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:35,463
[dramatic music]

1273
01:03:38,249 --> 01:03:42,993
[car engine roaring]
[dramatic music]

1274
01:03:52,785 --> 01:03:54,134
After very little thought,

1275
01:03:54,221 --> 01:03:57,268
I decided to take
the painting job.

1276
01:03:57,355 --> 01:03:58,747
"Decided" was an understatement.

1277
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:01,533
[dramatic music]

1278
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:03,665
[camera shutters]

1279
01:04:03,752 --> 01:04:06,668
[dramatic music]

1280
01:04:07,669 --> 01:04:10,063
- [Richie] How many you see?
- Two.

1281
01:04:11,978 --> 01:04:12,892
- Look again.

1282
01:04:12,979 --> 01:04:15,634
[dramatic music]

1283
01:04:20,378 --> 01:04:22,032
Still?
- Yeah.

1284
01:04:22,119 --> 01:04:23,207
- All right.

1285
01:04:24,686 --> 01:04:26,427
It's gonna be easier
to go over the wall

1286
01:04:26,514 --> 01:04:29,648
than go over that fence.
Just saying.

1287
01:04:29,735 --> 01:04:31,563
- All right,
let's get outta here.

1288
01:04:31,650 --> 01:04:33,608
I brought the genius
with me for the first stakeout

1289
01:04:33,695 --> 01:04:36,263
and quickly realized that
if this was gonna work,

1290
01:04:36,350 --> 01:04:39,049
I was gonna need a proper crew.

1291
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:42,139
Harvey hooked me up with lunch
and a lead.

1292
01:04:42,226 --> 01:04:44,924
- There's David Dallas
from Milwaukee.

1293
01:04:45,011 --> 01:04:46,491
He's in town for
a little business,

1294
01:04:46,578 --> 01:04:49,407
but he's always up for
a little something on the side.

1295
01:04:49,494 --> 01:04:51,278
- [Sammy] David Dallas.
You wouldn't know it

1296
01:04:51,365 --> 01:04:53,977
by looking at this guy,
but Dallas was military,

1297
01:04:54,064 --> 01:04:55,587
trained killer.

1298
01:04:55,674 --> 01:04:57,241
If anyone can help us
with our security problems,

1299
01:04:57,328 --> 01:04:58,372
it was Dallas.

1300
01:04:58,459 --> 01:05:01,680
- Excusez-moi, mademoiselle.

1301
01:05:01,767 --> 01:05:06,337
When you have a moment, no rush,
I would like another espresso.

1302
01:05:06,424 --> 01:05:07,991
Merci.

1303
01:05:08,078 --> 01:05:10,167
- [Sammy]
Great guy, amazing manners,

1304
01:05:10,254 --> 01:05:11,995
but if you were
on his shit list,

1305
01:05:12,082 --> 01:05:13,648
his sweet disposition
went out the window.

1306
01:05:13,735 --> 01:05:16,608
[dramatic music]

1307
01:05:16,695 --> 01:05:18,044
With all fairness, if Dallas
showed up at your door

1308
01:05:18,131 --> 01:05:20,177
unannounced, you had it coming.

1309
01:05:20,264 --> 01:05:22,309
[dramatic music]

1310
01:05:22,396 --> 01:05:25,008
- No, you don't need a big crew,

1311
01:05:25,095 --> 01:05:26,748
'cause you've got Dallas
taking care of security,

1312
01:05:26,835 --> 01:05:30,143
Richie is keeping
the car running,

1313
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:32,276
and you need one more thing.

1314
01:05:32,363 --> 01:05:34,147
- What's that?

1315
01:05:34,234 --> 01:05:35,627
- A decoy.

1316
01:05:35,714 --> 01:05:38,282
- [Sammy] Ruby Ellis.
A working girl.

1317
01:05:38,369 --> 01:05:39,370
- 30 minutes--

1318
01:05:39,631 --> 01:05:41,198
- [Sammy] And our mark's
favorite flavor.

1319
01:05:41,285 --> 01:05:43,417
Ruby was our decoy.

1320
01:05:43,504 --> 01:05:44,941
Ruby was gonna get Omar out
of the house

1321
01:05:45,028 --> 01:05:47,813
and give us enough time
to make the grab.

1322
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:50,947
The only thing is she
wanted a fee and a cut,

1323
01:05:51,034 --> 01:05:52,992
and she wanted
that fee upfront.

1324
01:05:53,079 --> 01:05:55,473
I hate that place. Come on.

1325
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:56,430
[knock on door]

1326
01:05:56,517 --> 01:05:58,258
- Speak of the devil.

1327
01:05:58,345 --> 01:05:59,564
Come in.

1328
01:05:59,651 --> 01:06:01,740
[dramatic music]

1329
01:06:01,827 --> 01:06:02,654
- Hi, Daddy.

1330
01:06:03,568 --> 01:06:05,787
[sighs]

1331
01:06:05,874 --> 01:06:08,965
- [chuckles]
You want something to eat?

1332
01:06:09,661 --> 01:06:11,097
- I'm good.

1333
01:06:11,184 --> 01:06:13,012
- [Harvey] You sure?

1334
01:06:13,099 --> 01:06:14,187
- You know what I like.

1335
01:06:14,274 --> 01:06:16,059
- Al Said has a classic weakness

1336
01:06:16,146 --> 01:06:18,191
and one
that we can fully exploit.

1337
01:06:18,278 --> 01:06:20,541
She's gonna keep Omar
very busy, okay?

1338
01:06:20,628 --> 01:06:23,240
So we'll have enough time
to make the grab.

1339
01:06:23,327 --> 01:06:25,459
- But you think
he'll be up for a date?

1340
01:06:25,546 --> 01:06:28,027
- Oh, yes. Omar? [laughs]

1341
01:06:29,333 --> 01:06:31,248
He's always up for me.

1342
01:06:31,335 --> 01:06:33,902
[Sammy and Harvey giggles]

1343
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,687
- I like her.
- Right?

1344
01:06:35,774 --> 01:06:36,905
- How much?

1345
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:39,212
- Small fee and small cut.

1346
01:06:39,299 --> 01:06:41,519
- Upfront, right?

1347
01:06:41,606 --> 01:06:43,303
- Always.

1348
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:45,436
- The America dream.

1349
01:06:45,523 --> 01:06:48,134
[dramatic music]

1350
01:06:51,572 --> 01:06:53,357
Sounds about right.

1351
01:06:53,444 --> 01:06:56,577
Well, it was so nice
to meet you, Sammy.

1352
01:06:56,664 --> 01:06:58,536
- Nice to meet you.
- [Ruby] See you later, Daddy.

1353
01:06:58,623 --> 01:07:00,146
- [Harvey] All right, baby,
take care.

1354
01:07:00,233 --> 01:07:01,452
- I felt like I was getting
five different diseases

1355
01:07:01,539 --> 01:07:03,410
just sitting there.

1356
01:07:04,368 --> 01:07:07,936
[dramatic music]

1357
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:09,895
Now I had a crew and a timeline,

1358
01:07:09,982 --> 01:07:11,636
and all I needed
was a babysitter.

1359
01:07:11,723 --> 01:07:14,378
[dramatic music]

1360
01:07:16,684 --> 01:07:18,034
Where's your uncle?

1361
01:07:18,121 --> 01:07:19,339
- Outside.

1362
01:07:19,426 --> 01:07:20,949
- What are you guys doing?

1363
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:23,343
- What does it look like?

1364
01:07:23,517 --> 01:07:25,563
- You don't have to be so mean.
- He's annoying.

1365
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:30,916
- Hey.
- Hey.

1366
01:07:35,834 --> 01:07:36,835
- Look at me.

1367
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:40,839
- I'm clean as a whistle.

1368
01:07:40,926 --> 01:07:41,970
I promise.

1369
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:44,364
- Serious?
- Yeah.

1370
01:07:44,451 --> 01:07:46,279
My head feels like it got
cracked open like a coconut,

1371
01:07:46,366 --> 01:07:48,064
but I'm good.

1372
01:07:49,108 --> 01:07:51,458
It's O.J.

1373
01:07:51,545 --> 01:07:53,634
Straight up,
just the way I like it.

1374
01:07:53,721 --> 01:07:56,115
- It is O.J. Proud of you.

1375
01:07:56,202 --> 01:07:59,162
- Yeah, well,
I'm not doing it for you.

1376
01:08:00,554 --> 01:08:02,034
I'm doing it for those girls
in there.

1377
01:08:02,121 --> 01:08:07,039
- I know. That's what
I wanna talk to you about.

1378
01:08:07,126 --> 01:08:08,736
- What's up?

1379
01:08:08,823 --> 01:08:10,651
- I got this job I gotta do.

1380
01:08:10,738 --> 01:08:12,523
- You got this job you gotta do.

1381
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:14,960
- And I wanna make sure you can
take care of the girls for me.

1382
01:08:15,047 --> 01:08:16,917
- Do you really feel good
about leaving those girls

1383
01:08:17,005 --> 01:08:18,310
with their degenerate uncle?

1384
01:08:18,398 --> 01:08:19,921
- No.

1385
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:21,749
- When you put it like that,
no.

1386
01:08:21,835 --> 01:08:23,621
- No, I'm serious.
Yes or no?

1387
01:08:23,708 --> 01:08:25,797
- Yes, I can do it.

1388
01:08:25,884 --> 01:08:27,059
- [cellphone buzzing]
- Beautiful, thank you.

1389
01:08:27,146 --> 01:08:28,930
Hold on.

1390
01:08:29,017 --> 01:08:30,758
Hello.

1391
01:08:30,844 --> 01:08:31,889
Yeah.

1392
01:08:33,370 --> 01:08:35,675
Okay, I'll be there
in 30 minutes.

1393
01:08:35,763 --> 01:08:37,635
- Duty calls?

1394
01:08:37,721 --> 01:08:39,376
- You're a real asshole
when you're sober,

1395
01:08:39,462 --> 01:08:41,508
but I'm proud of you.
Give me one.

1396
01:08:41,594 --> 01:08:43,162
- [Rob] Thanks.

1397
01:08:43,249 --> 01:08:47,210
- Thank you. I'll let you
know exactly what day.

1398
01:08:47,297 --> 01:08:48,341
Keep it up.

1399
01:08:48,602 --> 01:08:50,474
Rob didn't know exactly
what I did,

1400
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,171
but he definitely knew
I was in the shade,

1401
01:08:52,258 --> 01:08:54,521
but as long as he didn't
ask any tough questions,

1402
01:08:54,608 --> 01:08:56,958
I didn't have to come up
with some tough answers.

1403
01:08:57,045 --> 01:08:58,743
Audrey, I gotta run
for a little bit,

1404
01:08:58,830 --> 01:09:00,353
can you do me a favor
and hold down the court?

1405
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:02,964
- Yeah, sure.
- Wait, are you serious?

1406
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:04,227
- Great, so you're the boss.

1407
01:09:04,314 --> 01:09:06,011
- Oh, you're putting her
in charge?

1408
01:09:06,098 --> 01:09:08,361
- What about Uncle Rob?
- Keep an eye on him too.

1409
01:09:08,448 --> 01:09:10,885
- [Rachel] Wait,
I don't need a babysitter.

1410
01:09:10,971 --> 01:09:13,366
- [Sammy] I think you do.

1411
01:09:13,452 --> 01:09:15,629
- This is bullshit.
- Language.

1412
01:09:16,542 --> 01:09:18,979
[dramatic music]

1413
01:09:19,067 --> 01:09:20,678
- Richie.
- Yeah.

1414
01:09:20,764 --> 01:09:22,157
- You see the street?

1415
01:09:22,245 --> 01:09:23,246
- Yeah.

1416
01:09:23,333 --> 01:09:25,422
- Already, you can see it
by that.

1417
01:09:25,551 --> 01:09:27,380
There's a red barn-looking
thing.

1418
01:09:27,467 --> 01:09:28,816
- [Sammy] Right.

1419
01:09:28,903 --> 01:09:30,340
- All right,
that's a good spot to hide.

1420
01:09:30,426 --> 01:09:32,690
You understand?

1421
01:09:32,777 --> 01:09:35,300
Make sure you get all
the entrance and exits,

1422
01:09:35,606 --> 01:09:36,520
those guys there.

1423
01:09:36,607 --> 01:09:37,999
[camera shutter clicking]

1424
01:09:38,085 --> 01:09:39,914
- You see any street lights?

1425
01:09:40,001 --> 01:09:42,916
- Not right now, no.
There's none there.

1426
01:09:44,353 --> 01:09:46,050
You know, David, go up there.

1427
01:09:47,399 --> 01:09:49,924
Go up there with him. Show him
this and take some pictures

1428
01:09:50,011 --> 01:09:51,665
of that, all right?
Because you have to be there.

1429
01:09:51,752 --> 01:09:53,710
That takes about a minute and
a half, I timed it the other--

1430
01:09:53,798 --> 01:09:55,103
- I can work with this still,
guys.

1431
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:56,627
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1432
01:09:56,714 --> 01:09:58,803
- We'll take more pictures.
- It's very doable.

1433
01:09:58,889 --> 01:10:00,413
Where are they going?

1434
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:02,719
- I want him to take
some pictures of there.

1435
01:10:02,807 --> 01:10:06,811
I spoke to my guy,
I got a figure.

1436
01:10:06,898 --> 01:10:08,073
- And?

1437
01:10:10,902 --> 01:10:12,338
What, $5, 6 million?

1438
01:10:12,425 --> 01:10:15,080
[dramatic music]

1439
01:10:16,907 --> 01:10:18,300
[speaking in foreign language]

1440
01:10:18,388 --> 01:10:19,171
$30 million?

1441
01:10:19,258 --> 01:10:20,693
- Shh!

1442
01:10:20,781 --> 01:10:23,001
They shouldn't hear a thing.

1443
01:10:23,088 --> 01:10:24,481
30.

1444
01:10:24,568 --> 01:10:26,352
- $30 million.

1445
01:10:26,439 --> 01:10:29,137
He wasn't kidding about
keeping it between us.

1446
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:32,053
The others would get
a nice, decent cut,

1447
01:10:32,139 --> 01:10:34,317
and I can pay Ira in full

1448
01:10:34,404 --> 01:10:36,101
and still walk away
with a stupid amount.

1449
01:10:36,188 --> 01:10:38,364
[dramatic music]

1450
01:10:38,451 --> 01:10:43,326
- You know, it's time for
both of us to give up this life.

1451
01:10:43,413 --> 01:10:45,545
I'm gonna throw in the towel
as well.

1452
01:10:45,632 --> 01:10:47,808
- Throwing in the towel?
- Mm-hmm.

1453
01:10:47,895 --> 01:10:49,027
Whatever happened
to all the speeches

1454
01:10:49,114 --> 01:10:50,333
you used to tell me
in the office?

1455
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:52,422
"This is all I know.
This is my life."

1456
01:10:52,509 --> 01:10:55,773
- I know, I know, but you know,
it's never been $30 million.

1457
01:10:55,860 --> 01:10:57,818
You can be whoever
you want to be, right?

1458
01:10:57,905 --> 01:11:00,995
- Absolutely.
- I'm happy for you, Pops.

1459
01:11:01,082 --> 01:11:06,871
- You know, Sammy, when your
mother left me, I got angry.

1460
01:11:06,958 --> 01:11:11,179
I kept busy non-stop, and then
when she got sick and died,

1461
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:12,572
I feel guilt.

1462
01:11:12,659 --> 01:11:13,791
- I know.

1463
01:11:13,878 --> 01:11:14,791
- Keep going.

1464
01:11:14,879 --> 01:11:17,490
[dramatic music]

1465
01:11:17,577 --> 01:11:19,536
It's time that
we don't go anymore.

1466
01:11:19,623 --> 01:11:21,320
You understand?
Both of us.

1467
01:11:21,538 --> 01:11:23,800
[dramatic music]

1468
01:11:23,888 --> 01:11:24,628
All right.

1469
01:11:26,107 --> 01:11:29,415
[camera shutter clicking]

1470
01:11:29,502 --> 01:11:33,245
- What a fucking crock of shit.
They want more pictures?

1471
01:11:33,332 --> 01:11:36,161
- Relax.
- Don't tell me to relax.

1472
01:11:36,248 --> 01:11:37,467
- Well, you're not relaxing.

1473
01:11:37,554 --> 01:11:39,556
- Yeah, something's not right,
okay?

1474
01:11:39,643 --> 01:11:40,773
We're supposed to be crew,

1475
01:11:40,861 --> 01:11:42,689
and they're keeping us
out of the loop.

1476
01:11:42,776 --> 01:11:44,038
- What loop?

1477
01:11:44,865 --> 01:11:47,607
You're the fucking driver.
What more do you need to know?

1478
01:11:47,693 --> 01:11:51,437
Make sure there's gas in
the fucking car and relax, okay?

1479
01:11:51,523 --> 01:11:53,396
Don't worry about
the fucking loop.

1480
01:11:53,483 --> 01:11:56,224
Fucking loop,
what the hell is that?

1481
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:57,704
[camera shutter clicks]

1482
01:11:57,791 --> 01:12:00,054
I'm gonna say it again.
- Don't you say it.

1483
01:12:00,141 --> 01:12:02,187
- I'm fucking saying it.
- Don't you fucking say it!

1484
01:12:02,448 --> 01:12:04,102
- Relax.
- Fuck off, come on.

1485
01:12:04,189 --> 01:12:05,495
I'll show you relax. Let's go.

1486
01:12:05,582 --> 01:12:07,148
- Where you going?

1487
01:12:07,235 --> 01:12:09,237
[car door slams]
[car engine starts]

1488
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:10,369
Jesus Christ.

1489
01:12:10,456 --> 01:12:13,371
[car engine roaring]

1490
01:12:16,114 --> 01:12:18,072
Let's go around
to the other side, all right?

1491
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:19,509
See if we can get some shots
over there.

1492
01:12:21,772 --> 01:12:23,251
[car door closes]

1493
01:12:25,297 --> 01:12:27,168
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what happened? What? What?

1494
01:12:27,255 --> 01:12:29,432
- Rachel ran away.
- What? Oh, okay, okay.

1495
01:12:29,519 --> 01:12:31,389
Calm down. Don't worry
about it. I'm gonna find her.

1496
01:12:31,477 --> 01:12:33,044
- I don't know what happened.
She just freaked.

1497
01:12:33,130 --> 01:12:34,871
- She was upset.
I asked her what was going on,

1498
01:12:34,959 --> 01:12:36,482
and she freaked out.
She just left.

1499
01:12:36,568 --> 01:12:39,355
Don't worry about it.
Everything's gonna be fine.

1500
01:12:39,442 --> 01:12:42,401
Oh, shit.
Audrey, you need to calm down

1501
01:12:42,487 --> 01:12:44,316
until this woman leaves, okay?
Hi!

1502
01:12:44,403 --> 01:12:48,451
- Hi, Mr. Silverman, did I
catch you guys at a bad time?

1503
01:12:48,538 --> 01:12:52,324
- Uh, no, just, um, there--
there's a spider in the house.

1504
01:12:52,411 --> 01:12:54,457
- Yeah.
- A spider?

1505
01:12:54,544 --> 01:12:57,721
- Yeah, like a big spider.
- Huge.

1506
01:12:58,764 --> 01:13:01,159
- I'm afraid of spiders, too.
- [Sammy] Yeah.

1507
01:13:01,289 --> 01:13:03,291
- She hates 'em.

1508
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:06,120
- So how are you liking living
with your uncle and Sammy?

1509
01:13:06,207 --> 01:13:08,993
- Um...it's been fine.

1510
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:12,475
- It's fine?
- Uh, fun.

1511
01:13:12,562 --> 01:13:15,041
It's been fun, great.

1512
01:13:15,129 --> 01:13:17,741
- Where's your sister?
- Rach is, uh...

1513
01:13:17,827 --> 01:13:20,004
Rach was in the...
She's...

1514
01:13:20,091 --> 01:13:22,398
- She's in the shower.
She's taking a shower right now.

1515
01:13:22,485 --> 01:13:24,138
- Would you like to go get her
from me?

1516
01:13:24,225 --> 01:13:25,705
I'd like to speak with her, too.

1517
01:13:25,791 --> 01:13:29,448
- I don't know, teenage girls,
you know, with the creams

1518
01:13:29,796 --> 01:13:31,537
and the shaving,
I don't know what

1519
01:13:31,624 --> 01:13:33,147
she's doing in there, really.
It's gonna be a while.

1520
01:13:33,234 --> 01:13:34,627
- Okay, well, I won't
keep you much longer.

1521
01:13:34,714 --> 01:13:37,413
I was just checking in.
- Thank you.

1522
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:39,327
Uh, any news?

1523
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:42,068
- Not yet, but soon, I hope.
- Me too.

1524
01:13:42,156 --> 01:13:43,853
- Okay then, have a good night.
- Thank you.

1525
01:13:43,941 --> 01:13:45,333
- You too.
- It was good to see you.

1526
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:47,335
[mouths words]

1527
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:49,860
All right, listen, calm down.
I'm gonna go find her.

1528
01:13:49,947 --> 01:13:51,209
Everything's gonna be fine,
okay?

1529
01:13:51,296 --> 01:13:53,166
- [Rob] Yeah, yeah.
- All right, good save.

1530
01:13:53,254 --> 01:13:56,432
- Thanks. Hey, uh, I think
I know where she might be.

1531
01:13:56,693 --> 01:13:58,172
- What I'm thinking?
- [Rob] Yeah.

1532
01:13:58,259 --> 01:14:00,000
- All right, go back in
the house. I'm gonna call you.

1533
01:14:00,087 --> 01:14:02,089
- I got you. Let's go.
- All right.

1534
01:14:11,272 --> 01:14:13,492
- [basketball thuds]
- [Rachel] Oh, fuck.

1535
01:14:13,579 --> 01:14:14,493
- Hey.

1536
01:14:17,103 --> 01:14:19,498
How come this ball
doesn't have a puncture?

1537
01:14:19,585 --> 01:14:21,195
- Give it back.

1538
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:32,206
Come and take it.

1539
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:37,559
Come and take it.

1540
01:14:42,173 --> 01:14:43,130
No?

1541
01:14:50,224 --> 01:14:54,054
You know, when I was your age,
basketball saved my life.

1542
01:14:56,796 --> 01:15:01,148
I was a bad kid, hung out
with really bad people.

1543
01:15:01,235 --> 01:15:03,760
And basketball was the only
thing that kept me on track.

1544
01:15:03,847 --> 01:15:06,545
[gentle guitar music]

1545
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:12,290
You can't run away anymore,
Rach.

1546
01:15:15,162 --> 01:15:16,642
- This was his ball.

1547
01:15:19,166 --> 01:15:21,517
We'd come out here
and shoot for hours.

1548
01:15:21,603 --> 01:15:22,996
Just the two of us.

1549
01:15:24,650 --> 01:15:27,958
It was our thing,
and I could talk to him

1550
01:15:28,045 --> 01:15:32,309
about anything,
and he'd always listen to me.

1551
01:15:33,659 --> 01:15:35,574
Not fake listen, you know?

1552
01:15:37,054 --> 01:15:39,709
- I know you're hurting,

1553
01:15:39,796 --> 01:15:41,145
and I know I'm probably
not your favorite person

1554
01:15:41,232 --> 01:15:42,886
in the world right now,

1555
01:15:45,715 --> 01:15:51,503
and I'll never be your dad,
but I can promise you one thing,

1556
01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:53,070
that you don't have to go

1557
01:15:53,157 --> 01:15:54,375
through anything alone
ever again.

1558
01:15:54,462 --> 01:15:57,161
I'll always be here with you.

1559
01:15:57,248 --> 01:15:58,858
If you wanna come out here
and play basketball,

1560
01:15:58,945 --> 01:16:01,208
if that makes you feel better,
do it.

1561
01:16:01,295 --> 01:16:03,080
If you wanna puncture every
one of those balls, go ahead.

1562
01:16:03,166 --> 01:16:04,864
I'll even hold that ball
for you,

1563
01:16:04,951 --> 01:16:06,952
and you do it at the house.

1564
01:16:08,128 --> 01:16:09,565
But...

1565
01:16:11,130 --> 01:16:13,003
You gotta come home
at some point.

1566
01:16:13,090 --> 01:16:15,092
Your sister misses you
like crazy.

1567
01:16:15,179 --> 01:16:16,309
She's crying.

1568
01:16:16,397 --> 01:16:19,009
[dramatic music]

1569
01:16:23,361 --> 01:16:25,493
- Can you show me how
to do that two shot?

1570
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:27,539
- Really?
- [Rachel] Yeah.

1571
01:16:27,626 --> 01:16:28,932
- I'll show you
my favorite move.

1572
01:16:29,019 --> 01:16:29,933
- All right, do it.

1573
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:32,196
- Okay!
- Let's see it.

1574
01:16:33,501 --> 01:16:35,112
- Up the middle, bam!

1575
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:37,680
- [Rachel giggles]

1576
01:16:37,767 --> 01:16:38,550
- Come here.

1577
01:16:38,637 --> 01:16:41,291
[dramatic music]

1578
01:16:42,815 --> 01:16:43,990
I love you.

1579
01:16:44,077 --> 01:16:45,165
- [Rachel] I love you, too.

1580
01:16:45,252 --> 01:16:46,732
- Hold this.
Let me get my jacket.

1581
01:16:46,818 --> 01:16:47,690
- All right.

1582
01:16:54,174 --> 01:16:56,175
[sighs]

1583
01:16:56,263 --> 01:16:59,049
[dramatic music]

1584
01:17:00,005 --> 01:17:02,226
This was it, game day.

1585
01:17:02,313 --> 01:17:05,011
I'm not gonna lie, this was
always my favorite part.

1586
01:17:05,098 --> 01:17:06,447
All right, guys, listen up.

1587
01:17:06,534 --> 01:17:08,014
He's got two guys with him
all the time.

1588
01:17:08,101 --> 01:17:10,234
A date night's
not gonna change anything.

1589
01:17:10,321 --> 01:17:12,018
- Where is he taking you
for dinner?

1590
01:17:12,105 --> 01:17:16,457
- Somewhere with room service,
original.

1591
01:17:16,544 --> 01:17:18,198
- Classy.

1592
01:17:18,285 --> 01:17:20,070
- Dinner's gonna last
longer than him, so...

1593
01:17:20,157 --> 01:17:21,853
- All right, so there's not
gonna be a lot of time.

1594
01:17:21,941 --> 01:17:24,117
All right? So make sure,
Ruby, that you text me

1595
01:17:24,204 --> 01:17:26,598
the minute the fun time
is over.

1596
01:17:26,684 --> 01:17:28,687
- You got it.
- Okay.

1597
01:17:28,773 --> 01:17:31,255
- He's got two guys with him
at all times, like I said.

1598
01:17:31,342 --> 01:17:34,171
One's on the inside,
one's on the outside.

1599
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:35,955
- And they never stray
too far from one another.

1600
01:17:36,041 --> 01:17:38,305
So when they get close enough,
I'll take them both out.

1601
01:17:38,478 --> 01:17:40,699
- Hey, wait, what do you
mean take out? Take out what?

1602
01:17:40,786 --> 01:17:42,092
- Take 'em out.

1603
01:17:42,353 --> 01:17:44,137
What did you hire me for?
Teach 'em a magic trick?

1604
01:17:44,224 --> 01:17:47,358
- Oh, no, no. This is clean,
Dallas. I want this clean.

1605
01:17:47,445 --> 01:17:49,142
- Yeah, no guns on this,
please.

1606
01:17:49,228 --> 01:17:51,275
- These guys are packing heavy,
no doubt about it.

1607
01:17:51,492 --> 01:17:53,799
- Richie, we're going light
on this.

1608
01:17:53,886 --> 01:17:55,192
- All right, it's okay.

1609
01:17:55,279 --> 01:17:57,324
We'll use tasers
and zip ties, then, all right?

1610
01:17:57,411 --> 01:17:58,891
it won't be a problem.
- All right.

1611
01:17:58,978 --> 01:18:00,632
Now, what about the guy
on the inside?

1612
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:02,286
- We don't have any guns.

1613
01:18:02,373 --> 01:18:04,767
I guess we gotta go
with a ding-dong ditch.

1614
01:18:04,853 --> 01:18:06,856
- What's that?

1615
01:18:06,943 --> 01:18:09,075
- You know, it's the same thing
as a ring and run kind of thing.

1616
01:18:09,162 --> 01:18:12,121
- You knock on the door.
When he answers, boom!

1617
01:18:12,209 --> 01:18:13,818
Zip goes the weasel.

1618
01:18:13,906 --> 01:18:16,126
- It's pop.
Pop goes the weasel.

1619
01:18:16,213 --> 01:18:17,867
- [Harvey] Clean, perfect.

1620
01:18:17,954 --> 01:18:22,349
- All right, cameras inside,
outside, all over the property.

1621
01:18:22,436 --> 01:18:23,829
- What are we doing about that?

1622
01:18:23,916 --> 01:18:26,092
- I know a guy who knows
a guy.

1623
01:18:26,179 --> 01:18:28,007
- Of course you do.

1624
01:18:28,094 --> 01:18:29,182
- Look, you're gonna have
30 minutes

1625
01:18:29,269 --> 01:18:31,663
from the time the lights go out,

1626
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:33,099
but that's our window.

1627
01:18:33,186 --> 01:18:35,580
So make sure you have watch
and synchronize.

1628
01:18:35,666 --> 01:18:36,668
You understand?

1629
01:18:36,755 --> 01:18:38,061
- All right, Richie, listen,

1630
01:18:38,148 --> 01:18:40,150
you sit in the car,
engine running, right?

1631
01:18:40,237 --> 01:18:42,413
Once the lights go down,
Dallas is gonna go in,

1632
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:43,980
knock the guards out.

1633
01:18:44,067 --> 01:18:45,808
I come in, steal the painting,

1634
01:18:45,895 --> 01:18:47,026
and we'll meet back
at the house.

1635
01:18:47,157 --> 01:18:48,549
- [Harvey] Easy peasy.
- All right.

1636
01:18:48,636 --> 01:18:51,857
- Any questions?
- Is that everything?

1637
01:18:51,943 --> 01:18:54,380
'Cause, like, I kind of
have to go get ready.

1638
01:18:54,686 --> 01:18:55,818
- Yeah, we should all go.

1639
01:18:55,905 --> 01:18:59,082
- No, I got a question,
just one.

1640
01:18:59,169 --> 01:19:02,389
So, uh, I took the time to do
a little research

1641
01:19:02,476 --> 01:19:05,218
about these paintings,
what they might go for

1642
01:19:06,132 --> 01:19:09,483
and, oh, fuck me, I mean,
these things are worth a lot.

1643
01:19:09,570 --> 01:19:11,442
- So what's the question?

1644
01:19:11,529 --> 01:19:13,443
- Oh, what I'm saying is

1645
01:19:13,531 --> 01:19:15,620
that maybe we're being
a little shortchanged.

1646
01:19:15,707 --> 01:19:17,404
I mean, what if
one of our paintings

1647
01:19:17,491 --> 01:19:19,058
are worth that much, right?

1648
01:19:19,145 --> 01:19:21,844
And if I get 5% and when I
do the math, bang, bang, bang,

1649
01:19:21,931 --> 01:19:24,716
it just, you know,
doesn't really add up,

1650
01:19:24,803 --> 01:19:28,938
so what I'm trying to say is you
got me on a fucking discount.

1651
01:19:29,025 --> 01:19:31,244
- You know, Richie,
bang, bang, bang.

1652
01:19:31,331 --> 01:19:33,769
This is no time to be
negotiating salaries, okay?

1653
01:19:33,856 --> 01:19:35,553
You're gonna do very well,
please.

1654
01:19:35,639 --> 01:19:38,251
- Pops, the guy is getting 5%
for sitting in a car.

1655
01:19:38,338 --> 01:19:40,818
- For God's sakes,
I do less on my knees.

1656
01:19:40,906 --> 01:19:45,737
- How about you, Dallas?
What do you feel about 5%, huh?

1657
01:19:47,434 --> 01:19:49,262
- You gotta be fucking
kidding me right now.

1658
01:19:49,349 --> 01:19:50,873
- Listen, what he's making

1659
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:52,309
is none of your business,
all right?

1660
01:19:52,396 --> 01:19:53,963
He's bringing much more
to the table, Richie.

1661
01:19:54,050 --> 01:19:56,008
You're gonna be very well
taken care of.

1662
01:19:56,094 --> 01:19:58,010
So just calm down.

1663
01:19:58,097 --> 01:19:59,490
- Do you need a ride, honey?

1664
01:19:59,577 --> 01:20:01,318
- Yo, Richie,
hold on one second.

1665
01:20:01,405 --> 01:20:03,755
We're good, right?
- Yeah, we're good, man.

1666
01:20:03,842 --> 01:20:05,452
- We're good.
- No, no, calm down, Richie.

1667
01:20:05,539 --> 01:20:07,411
- Calm down.
- We're good, we're good.

1668
01:20:07,498 --> 01:20:10,457
- Dallas, are we good?
- We're good. Hey, Richie,

1669
01:20:10,544 --> 01:20:12,633
let me catch a lift, too, huh?

1670
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:14,548
[dramatic music]

1671
01:20:14,635 --> 01:20:16,898
- All right then.

1672
01:20:16,986 --> 01:20:19,597
This son of a bitch, I should
have listened to you.

1673
01:20:19,684 --> 01:20:23,731
- What did I tell you?
He's tearing up the whole thing.

1674
01:20:23,818 --> 01:20:27,039
- Ah, boy, oh boy.
You were right.

1675
01:20:27,126 --> 01:20:29,389
- I had a bad feeling now,
a bad taste in my mouth,

1676
01:20:29,476 --> 01:20:31,261
and it wasn't tea.

1677
01:20:31,348 --> 01:20:35,004
I kept waiting for Laura to
appear and tell me to walk away,

1678
01:20:35,091 --> 01:20:36,440
but it wasn't just me
and my gut.

[dramatic music]

1680
01:20:39,530 --> 01:20:41,837
Getting ready for a job
always made me nervous,

1681
01:20:41,924 --> 01:20:45,405
especially a job
I've never done before.

1682
01:20:46,276 --> 01:20:49,018
I don't know a thing about art,
except that it's overpriced,

1683
01:20:49,105 --> 01:20:53,109
and it's much easier to move
around when it's rolled up.

1684
01:20:53,196 --> 01:20:54,937
I do know a few things
about robberies, though.

1685
01:20:55,023 --> 01:20:56,329
[gun cocks]

1686
01:20:56,416 --> 01:20:57,983
If you bring a gun,
there's a good chance

1687
01:20:58,070 --> 01:21:00,377
you're gonna use it.

1688
01:21:00,464 --> 01:21:02,205
[dramatic music]

1689
01:21:15,522 --> 01:21:16,654
- That's crazy.

1690
01:21:18,743 --> 01:21:21,789
- Hey, guys,
don't wait up for me,

1691
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:24,096
I gotta go do some work thing,
okay?

1692
01:21:24,183 --> 01:21:26,664
- Where are you going?
- I got a work thing I gotta do,

1693
01:21:26,969 --> 01:21:29,623
but, uh, the good news
is when it's done...

1694
01:21:30,668 --> 01:21:32,278
we're gonna spend
a lot of time together.

1695
01:21:32,365 --> 01:21:33,800
- What thing?

1696
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:35,760
- It's just a work thing.

1697
01:21:35,978 --> 01:21:37,762
- Hey, can I get another beer
while you're up?

1698
01:21:37,849 --> 01:21:41,374
- I got you.
- Sammy.

1699
01:21:43,724 --> 01:21:46,553
Get out of here. I got this.
Don't worry about it.

1700
01:21:49,208 --> 01:21:51,602
- I just wanted to say goodbye,
you know?

1701
01:21:51,689 --> 01:21:53,603
- Don't you think those girls
have had enough goodbyes

1702
01:21:53,691 --> 01:21:54,910
for a while?

1703
01:21:56,389 --> 01:21:58,261
- [whispers]
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1704
01:21:58,348 --> 01:22:00,437
- You can tell them
when you get back.

1705
01:22:02,395 --> 01:22:03,875
- Okay.

1706
01:22:03,962 --> 01:22:05,790
- Hey, uh...

1707
01:22:07,270 --> 01:22:08,835
I wanted to thank you.

1708
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:10,751
- For what?

1709
01:22:10,838 --> 01:22:12,666
- Just felt like the right thing
to say.

1710
01:22:15,539 --> 01:22:17,106
- When you think about
something to tell me,

1711
01:22:17,193 --> 01:22:18,759
you tell me what I'm back,
okay?

1712
01:22:18,846 --> 01:22:20,500
- Yeah.

1713
01:22:20,587 --> 01:22:22,023
- I love you girls.

1714
01:22:22,111 --> 01:22:24,591
- Bye. Love you.
- Bye.

1715
01:22:24,809 --> 01:22:25,984
- Take care of them for me,
okay?

1716
01:22:26,071 --> 01:22:27,681
- I got you.

1717
01:22:27,768 --> 01:22:29,945
- Take care of them.

1737
01:24:20,794 --> 01:24:22,144
I'm gonna go check it out.
Over.

[cellphone buzzing]

1742
01:25:05,709 --> 01:25:07,058
- Ruby, what's up?

1743
01:25:07,145 --> 01:25:09,800
It's over, Papi.
- [Harvey] What?

1744
01:25:09,887 --> 01:25:13,195
- I mean, over, done,
he couldn't get it up.

1745
01:25:13,282 --> 01:25:15,022
- When?
- I don't know,

1746
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:17,895
like 10 minutes ago
or something, maybe.

1747
01:25:17,982 --> 01:25:19,201
10 minutes ago?
You should've--

1748
01:25:19,288 --> 01:25:21,290
You should've texted.
Why didn't you text?

1749
01:25:21,377 --> 01:25:25,076
I ain't your fucking secretary.
The fuck? I did my job.

1750
01:25:25,163 --> 01:25:27,034
- Dammit.

1751

1754
01:25:48,317 --> 01:25:50,623
- [cellphone buzzes]
- Yeah.

1755
01:25:50,710 --> 01:25:53,017
- Richie, the mark
is on his way.

1756
01:25:53,103 --> 01:25:54,584
How long I got?

1757
01:25:54,671 --> 01:25:56,107
- Five minutes tops.

1758
01:25:56,193 --> 01:25:58,065
- All right, no, I'm on it,
I'm on it, I'm on it.

1759
01:25:58,153 --> 01:26:00,416
[dramatic music]

1760
01:26:54,557 --> 01:26:56,950
- [whispers] Hey, hey. Shh, shh.
It's okay.

1761
01:26:57,037 --> 01:27:00,258
Shh, come, quiet.

1762
01:27:00,344 --> 01:27:02,391
Shh, don't scream, don't scream.

1763
01:27:04,130 --> 01:27:05,742
What are you doing here?
You're scaring the kid.

1764
01:27:05,829 --> 01:27:07,047
Put the gun away.

1765
01:27:07,134 --> 01:27:10,137
- No, no, the only thing
scaring this kid

1766
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:12,705
is the two scary men
in the living room.

1767
01:27:12,791 --> 01:27:14,664
Three scary men.

1768
01:27:14,751 --> 01:27:16,492
- Dallas, talk some sense
into him.

1769
01:27:16,579 --> 01:27:17,884
He's got a gun with him.

1770
01:27:17,971 --> 01:27:20,191
- I think he's making
perfect sense, Sammy.

1771
01:27:20,278 --> 01:27:23,803
- That's right. Now his father's
gonna be here any minute,

1772
01:27:23,889 --> 01:27:25,892
and we were gonna do this
the hard way, right?

1773
01:27:25,978 --> 01:27:28,634
But I think Omar will
give us anything we want

1774
01:27:28,721 --> 01:27:30,767
in exchange for junior
over here.

1775
01:27:30,853 --> 01:27:33,813
- What are you guys doing?
Why are you doing this?

1776
01:27:33,900 --> 01:27:36,555
Listen to me very carefully.

1777
01:27:36,642 --> 01:27:38,469
I'm gonna take this painting.

1778
01:27:38,557 --> 01:27:41,038
I'm gonna go home,
and I'll meet you there.

1779
01:27:41,125 --> 01:27:43,910
- [Richie] Just like we said,
just like we said.

1780
01:27:43,996 --> 01:27:48,698
- We're taking all the paintings
and we're taking the kid too.

1781
01:27:48,785 --> 01:27:51,483
- That's right, we're emptying
Omar's whole fucking place,

1782
01:27:51,570 --> 01:27:52,702
then you and your dad
could go home

1783
01:27:52,789 --> 01:27:55,094
and have
your fucking circle jerk.

1784
01:27:55,182 --> 01:27:57,924
- Okay. Okay.

1785
01:27:58,011 --> 01:28:01,493
Don't hurt the kid, okay?

1786
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:04,975
- We're not gonna hurt the kid
Sammy. We're not animals.

1787
01:28:05,062 --> 01:28:08,108
This isn't personal.
What can I say?

1788
01:28:08,195 --> 01:28:08,934
Money talks.

1789
01:28:09,022 --> 01:28:10,546

1792
01:28:16,682 --> 01:28:21,339
- Yeah, Sammy, the painting.

1793
01:28:21,425 --> 01:28:22,775

[dramatic music]

1797
01:28:31,349 --> 01:28:32,871

Dad, stop them!

What's wrong?

Is somebody inside?

- All right,
you got the painting?

1806
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:59,464
- I've got the painting.
I got the painting.

1807
01:28:59,594 --> 01:29:02,728
- [child] No!
- Wait right here.

1808
01:29:02,815 --> 01:29:03,990
Wait here for one second.

1809

- What the fuck?

1813
01:29:20,702 --> 01:29:22,879
- [Sammy] Difference between
a good thief and a hack

1814
01:29:22,966 --> 01:29:24,750
is simple--greed.

1815
01:29:24,837 --> 01:29:26,709
- Christ Almighty,
what the fuck?

1816
01:29:26,796 --> 01:29:29,059
- [Sammy] Get greedy,
you get sloppy.

1817
01:29:29,146 --> 01:29:30,190
- Junior!

1818
01:29:30,277 --> 01:29:31,409
Jamal, go get my kid.

1824
01:29:40,331 --> 01:29:42,333
- What?

1825
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:45,510
- Michael Dunbar is the buyer.
Number's in my...my phone.

1826
01:29:47,556 --> 01:29:49,384
- [Sammy] Okay, Pops.
- [Harvey] We have to call him.

1827
01:29:49,471 --> 01:29:50,907
- [Sammy] You call him
when we get there.

1828
01:29:50,994 --> 01:29:54,258
- My code is 0809.
You have to call.

1829
01:29:55,259 --> 01:29:57,609
- Wait, Pops, are you okay?
- [Harvey] [weakly] Yes.

1830

Oh my, God.

Oh, my God, okay, okay, Pops.

Fuck, hold on, hold on! Put
your--Put some pressure on it.

1833
01:30:05,269 --> 01:30:07,053

"I Love Us."

1846
01:30:33,950 --> 01:30:35,995
If you told me five years ago,
those three little

1847
01:30:36,082 --> 01:30:37,127
corny words would be
the most important words

1848
01:30:37,214 --> 01:30:38,737
in my life one day,

1849
01:30:40,870 --> 01:30:44,395
I would say I can't wait.

1850
01:30:47,050 --> 01:30:48,791

I don't wanna lie
to you guys anymore.

Can't lie to myself.

1854

Can't lie to anybody.

1855
01:31:11,074 --> 01:31:13,119
As you know, the adoption
got approved.

1856
01:31:19,952 --> 01:31:23,260
You guys can be my kids now,

1857
01:31:23,347 --> 01:31:25,915
and we can be a family,

1858
01:31:26,002 --> 01:31:28,395
but only on one condition.

1859
01:31:32,269 --> 01:31:34,401
You guys have to want me
to be your dad.

1860
01:31:41,321 --> 01:31:43,236
- You're wrong, you know?

1861
01:31:43,323 --> 01:31:45,674
- [Sammy] About what?

1862
01:31:45,761 --> 01:31:47,719
- About that being
the whole story.

1863
01:31:49,416 --> 01:31:51,418
- It's everything, I swear.

1864
01:31:53,072 --> 01:31:57,903

that this isn't the end.

1865
01:31:59,818 --> 01:32:01,472

Come. Come.

- So beautiful.
We have to teach them some--

after us.

Turns out his son was
worth a lot more to him

Sammy, come on!

- [Audrey] Come on!

1893
01:33:29,255 --> 01:33:31,562

he ever told me was

1894
01:33:31,648 --> 01:33:32,607
that it was time to let go.
