Nice run?

00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:53,129
Yeah, thanks.

00:02:53,216 --> 00:02:55,218
-She up yet?
-What do you think?

10
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,005
-[Hailey] Sienna.
-Hmm?

11
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,794
Come on.
We got packing to do.

12
00:03:06,577 --> 00:03:07,274
Go away.

13
00:03:09,493 --> 00:03:11,930
Three days. That's it,
and then you'll feel better.

14
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,367
Sienna.

15
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,154
I've invested too much time
in your recovery

16
00:03:18,285 --> 00:03:20,461
for you mess things up again,
okay?

17
00:03:24,508 --> 00:03:26,728
-Get up.
-Ah.

18

22
00:04:19,563 --> 00:04:21,303
[Josh] So this is it?

23
00:04:21,391 --> 00:04:23,001
This is the place you learned
to be--

24
00:04:23,088 --> 00:04:24,786
[Hailey] ...a medic.

25
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,702
We used to spend weeks up here
trekking through this forest.

26
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:29,094
I hated it.

27
00:04:29,181 --> 00:04:31,140
[Josh] And you wanted
to come back. Why?

28
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,447
I strangely missed it.

29
00:04:33,534 --> 00:04:36,276
The air, the nature,
secludedness.

30
00:04:36,363 --> 00:04:37,364
It's nice.

31
00:04:37,494 --> 00:04:39,582
I'm not sure Sienna
would ever like it.

32
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,890
Yeah, well, she's nearly
over the hill.

33
00:04:41,977 --> 00:04:45,197
These next few days
will be rough for her, so...

34
00:04:45,241 --> 00:04:47,852
-We have to make an effort.
-Yes, Sarge.

35
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:49,985
It's Captain to you.

36
00:04:50,028 --> 00:04:51,508
Permission to ask
a question, Captain?

37
00:04:52,074 --> 00:04:54,032
Hmm. What is it?

[birds chirping]

39
00:05:02,084 --> 00:05:03,259
You know that...

40
00:05:04,173 --> 00:05:06,393
what we talked about?

41
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:14,139
I think I'm ready
to start trying.

[soft sentimental tune]

43
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,494

[giggles] My sister
is right there.

45
00:05:23,061 --> 00:05:24,976
She's not gonna hear.

46
00:05:25,063 --> 00:05:26,935
[giggles] But seriously

47
00:05:27,022 --> 00:05:28,980
there's never perfect time

48
00:05:29,981 --> 00:05:31,592
or a place...

-Hmm?
-[giggles]

51
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,514
Did you just rehearse that?

52
00:05:41,602 --> 00:05:42,516
No...

53
00:05:44,735 --> 00:05:45,432

Guys, guys.

59
00:06:30,215 --> 00:06:31,478
You have to see this.

60
00:06:33,915 --> 00:06:34,959
-Oh, God.
-[Hailey] Sienna.

61
00:06:35,046 --> 00:06:36,439
Guys, come on.

62
00:06:50,801 --> 00:06:52,020
This better be good.

63
00:06:55,153 --> 00:06:57,286
[Josh] Hailey!

64
00:06:57,373 --> 00:06:58,592
What could possibly--

65
00:06:59,854 --> 00:07:01,421
Wait.

I have to call Lyssa.

-Is that what I think it is?
-I think so.

69
00:07:21,092 --> 00:07:22,224
It's beautiful.

70
00:07:25,314 --> 00:07:26,402
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

71
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:27,490
We don't know if it's friendly.

72
00:07:27,577 --> 00:07:29,144
I don't see the Army anywhere.

73
00:07:29,187 --> 00:07:30,798
What if it just got here?

74
00:07:30,841 --> 00:07:32,408
If they were here
to take over the world

75
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:34,018
they would have done it
already.

76
00:07:37,892 --> 00:07:39,110
[suspenseful music]

77
00:07:44,115 --> 00:07:45,682
Wooh, wooh, wait, wait.

78
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:55,692
Sienna?

79
00:07:56,911 --> 00:07:57,607

You okay?

96
00:09:51,068 --> 00:09:52,809
Baby, wake up.

97
00:09:58,206 --> 00:09:59,250
What happened?

98
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:02,210
I don't know.

99
00:10:04,342 --> 00:10:05,692
I guess they are not friendly.

100
00:10:07,171 --> 00:10:09,434
No, not at all.

101
00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:14,222
Oh, my phone's not working.

102
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,403
How long were we are for?

103
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,057
I don't know, it's night.

104
00:10:23,144 --> 00:10:25,015
Few hours?

105
00:10:25,102 --> 00:10:28,279
We need to go to the car.
We need to check the car radio.

106
00:10:28,366 --> 00:10:31,282
Yeah, good idea.

107
00:10:31,369 --> 00:10:32,632
Let's just hope it still works.

108
00:10:35,156 --> 00:10:36,287
Come on.

00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,967
Let's get packed up.

111

Get the stuff to the car.

[blast]

119
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:43,877
But where?

120
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,545
We're staying.

121
00:12:02,243 --> 00:12:04,245
We're staying, it's safer.

122
00:12:04,332 --> 00:12:05,855
-Okay.
-What?

123
00:12:08,815 --> 00:12:10,904
We can't go back.
What's the point?

124
00:12:10,991 --> 00:12:13,471
I'm going to sort out
the wood for the fire.

125
00:12:13,558 --> 00:12:15,604
Go to the car, check the radio.

126
00:12:15,691 --> 00:12:17,606
See if you can find out
what's going on.

127
00:12:17,693 --> 00:12:19,651
I need you to go to the car.

128
00:12:19,695 --> 00:12:21,175
I need you to grab
the lighter fluid.

129
00:12:21,262 --> 00:12:22,524
Can you do that?

[sobs]

131
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:28,573
The walk will do you good.

132
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,575
It'll keep you warm.

133
00:12:30,662 --> 00:12:31,794
Josh, look after her.

134
00:12:33,187 --> 00:12:34,841
You'll be fine.

135
00:12:34,928 --> 00:12:36,103
I'll be fine.

136
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,408
Okay

143
00:13:30,766 --> 00:13:31,811
Is the radio working, then?

144
00:13:33,508 --> 00:13:34,552
No, it's dead.

145
00:13:35,684 --> 00:13:37,555
Can you not just start the car?

146
00:13:37,642 --> 00:13:39,470
There's no point.

147
00:13:39,557 --> 00:13:41,995
What do you want from cars
that got computers.

148
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,346
So whatever that was...

149
00:13:45,433 --> 00:13:46,695
would have fried everything...

150
00:13:48,305 --> 00:13:49,437
along with our phones.

151
00:13:53,354 --> 00:13:54,398

Managed to get it going?

159
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,799
You got any food?

160
00:15:37,023 --> 00:15:39,155
I have some marshmallows...

161
00:15:41,027 --> 00:15:45,945

some cheese, some soup.

Guys, there's something there.

167
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,212
[Josh] Who is there?

168
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,087
[Josh shouts] Stop.

169
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:44,220
Stop!

170
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:46,657
Stop.

-Stop.

[thud]

175
00:17:01,237 --> 00:17:02,195
Is she okay?

176
00:17:04,501 --> 00:17:05,720
Is she...

177
00:17:05,762 --> 00:17:07,113
Check her pulse.

We need to go.
Give me the bag.

00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:54,116
Sienna, pack up the tent.

190
00:17:58,947 --> 00:18:00,862
[sinister tone]

191
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:11,264
-Okay.
-[Hailey] We need to keep going.

192
00:18:11,351 --> 00:18:13,527
Your sister's not going
to go any further.

193
00:18:13,614 --> 00:18:14,919
Look, the further we are away

194
00:18:14,963 --> 00:18:16,747
the safer we'll be.
Come on.

195
00:18:16,834 --> 00:18:18,271
Hailey, I'm tired,
I'm hungry

196
00:18:18,358 --> 00:18:19,707
and we haven't seen
one of those things in a while.

197
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,056
We're staying here.

198
00:18:25,974 --> 00:18:27,323
Are we staying or going?

199
00:18:57,701 --> 00:18:59,138
It's broken

200
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:01,923
We need to keep moving.

201
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,664
We can't just walk in the dark.

202
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:05,927
[indistinct]

203
00:19:06,014 --> 00:19:07,233
I'm not leaving her.

204
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,670
If we carry on walking
she'll follow us.

205
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,324
Come on.

206
00:19:11,411 --> 00:19:14,109
You need to pick
her up and get out of here.

207
00:19:16,546 --> 00:19:17,286
Who are you?

208
00:19:21,986 --> 00:19:23,162
Those things are everywhere.

209
00:19:26,426 --> 00:19:27,470
What are they?

210
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:30,256
I don't know, mate.

211
00:19:30,343 --> 00:19:33,215
But they don't stop.
So you shouldn't either.

212
00:19:33,302 --> 00:19:35,174
Stay quiet
and find a place to hide.

213
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,395
Where are you hiding?

214
00:19:43,834 --> 00:19:45,662
I've been in my holiday home.

215
00:19:45,706 --> 00:19:46,924
Is it far?

216
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:57,413
All right. You three look
like you need a hand.

217
00:20:00,808 --> 00:20:02,201
Stay quiet. Stay out of sight.

218
00:20:11,601 --> 00:20:12,994
[soft intriguing music]

219
00:20:44,068 --> 00:20:45,809
[foreboding music]

220
00:21:10,356 --> 00:21:12,271
[dramatic chord]

221
00:21:15,143 --> 00:21:16,449
[Liam] Run faster, please.

222
00:21:16,536 --> 00:21:17,928
[Hailey]
We're faster than them.

223
00:21:18,015 --> 00:21:19,930
[Liam] You don't get it.

224
00:21:20,017 --> 00:21:21,367
They don't stop.

225
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:30,376
[gasps]

226
00:21:36,033 --> 00:21:37,470
Wait, wait, wait.

227
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,993
This trail.
If we follow this trail

228
00:21:39,036 --> 00:21:41,822
we can make it to the coast
in about three or four days.

229
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:43,127
Three or four days?

230
00:21:43,214 --> 00:21:44,738
If we keep up the pace,
we can stay ahead

231
00:21:44,825 --> 00:21:45,695
of those creatures.

232
00:21:45,782 --> 00:21:47,262
Ad you even trust this man?

233
00:21:47,393 --> 00:21:49,046
He seems
to know where he's going

234
00:21:49,177 --> 00:21:51,048
so I'm gonna take my chances

235
00:21:51,135 --> 00:21:53,529
-Hailey?
-She's right, Josh. Come on.

236
00:21:56,967 --> 00:21:58,534
Josh, come on.

237
00:22:09,893 --> 00:22:11,199
Come on love.

238
00:22:13,027 --> 00:22:14,289

[alien growling]

240
00:22:34,091 --> 00:22:35,397

[pained whimper]

243
00:22:54,895 --> 00:22:56,636
You owe me one.

244
00:23:01,292 --> 00:23:03,686
Why have they stopped her?

245
00:23:03,817 --> 00:23:04,992
They're outnumbered.

246
00:23:05,732 --> 00:23:07,255
[roars]

247
00:23:17,091 --> 00:23:18,484
[Liam] Okay, we're clear.

248
00:23:22,313 --> 00:23:23,532
Josh, keep a lookout.

249
00:23:24,881 --> 00:23:26,230
-Map.
-Yeah.

-[breathes heavily]

254
00:24:12,886 --> 00:24:14,322
All right?

[sobs]

258
00:24:43,569 --> 00:24:45,309
I'm sorry I brought you here.

259
00:24:49,226 --> 00:24:52,099
-I did it for you.
-I can't...

260
00:24:55,015 --> 00:24:57,670
I can't do this anymore.

261
00:24:57,757 --> 00:25:00,324
I need you to do
something to make it.

262
00:25:00,368 --> 00:25:01,630
I need to dig deep

263
00:25:04,154 --> 00:25:07,680
because we need to get
the hell out of here.

264
00:25:07,767 --> 00:25:09,725
You can, you can.

265
00:25:11,379 --> 00:25:13,729
Have I ever lied to you?
Have I?

266
00:25:15,818 --> 00:25:16,993
I promise you.

267
00:25:17,037 --> 00:25:19,605
I'm not going to let
anything happen to you.

268
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:21,824
I swear.

269
00:25:21,955 --> 00:25:22,651
Okay?

270
00:25:37,144 --> 00:25:38,406
It's okay.

[brooding music]

274
00:26:31,894 --> 00:26:34,201
[Liam]
Right, it's just up here.

275
00:26:34,288 --> 00:26:37,421
-We call it Emerald Ridge.
-[Hailey] Who is we?

276
00:26:37,508 --> 00:26:39,119
Me and my business associates.

277
00:26:45,908 --> 00:26:48,563
We need to discuss terms
before we get there.

278
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,609
-Terms?
-Yeah, terms.

279
00:26:51,914 --> 00:26:53,176
So what do you want?

280
00:26:53,263 --> 00:26:54,700
My house, my rules.

281
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:57,572
So you do as I say
when I say it.

282
00:26:57,703 --> 00:26:59,705
Secondly, we're splitting
these supplies

283
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:02,359
and thirdly,
you stay out of my tent.

284
00:27:03,491 --> 00:27:05,145
Specially her.

[suspenseful music]

286
00:27:12,718 --> 00:27:13,719
Fine.

287
00:27:14,807 --> 00:27:15,851
Lead the way.

[helicopter whirring]

289
00:27:57,588 --> 00:27:59,068
Hailey, give me some lights.

290
00:27:59,155 --> 00:28:01,331
Give me the flares,
give me the flares.

292
00:28:08,251 --> 00:28:09,470
Where is he going?

293
00:28:09,557 --> 00:28:10,689
To find the key ring.

[indistinct]

295
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,790

What are you doing,
you stupid prick?

303
00:29:35,512 --> 00:29:36,557
Get off me.

You two, stop.

313
00:30:18,729 --> 00:30:20,340
Everyone knows where we are now.

314
00:30:22,516 --> 00:30:24,692
You're on your own.

What the hell
are you playing at?

316
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:29,436
It wasn't me.

317
00:30:29,479 --> 00:30:30,916
I wasn't in control.

318
00:30:34,267 --> 00:30:37,009
You just say the word
and I walk away, I promise.

-Over there.

326
00:31:21,836 --> 00:31:23,838
He's going to get us all killed.

327
00:31:23,969 --> 00:31:26,406
You can't just leave us here
with no food.

328
00:31:26,493 --> 00:31:28,538
Watch me.

329
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:30,018

the only route in

What happened to his hand
since last night?

346
00:34:31,982 --> 00:34:33,201
It'll get better tomorrow.

347
00:34:33,245 --> 00:34:34,811
Hailey, he's turning
into one of them.

348
00:34:34,898 --> 00:34:37,771
Be quiet, please.

349
00:34:37,813 --> 00:34:39,815
If that stuff in his hand
changes him

350
00:34:39,902 --> 00:34:41,340
we'll deal with it, okay?
I promise.

351
00:34:41,382 --> 00:34:43,907
Do you really want
to be stuck with Liam?

352
00:34:48,956 --> 00:34:51,219
Haily,
you can't hide this forever.

I found this old radio.

357
00:35:19,552 --> 00:35:20,509
Get it fixed.

358
00:35:20,596 --> 00:35:22,990
See if we can find out
anything useful.

359
00:35:27,647 --> 00:35:29,344
Care to give us a house tour?

360
00:35:31,346 --> 00:35:33,653
This ain't
the Four Seasons, mate.

361
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,176
Stay out.

00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,189
What kind of a person
needs a hideout?

363
00:35:50,626 --> 00:35:52,237
The kind that survives.

You do realize that's
an old short wave radio.

367
00:37:23,632 --> 00:37:26,374
We're going to need
a battery and antenna.

368

-We'll get more luck--
-Look, I'm just trying to help.

I'm sorry.

What strange is that is
in the middle of the forest

372
00:37:57,666 --> 00:38:01,235
and it only has a short wave,
a few miles max?

373
00:38:01,366 --> 00:38:03,019
So whoever originally
put that in that tent

374
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,804
...was in range
of a bigger base.

375
00:38:04,891 --> 00:38:05,892
Exactly.

376
00:38:05,979 --> 00:38:08,329
So why don't we lead them out?

377
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:11,593
I have to figure out
what it is first.

378
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,812
I'll get some supplies.

379
00:38:12,942 --> 00:38:14,030
You can tell Sienna.

380
00:38:14,161 --> 00:38:15,336
She'll be more
compliant with you.

381
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,598
And Liam?

382
00:38:16,685 --> 00:38:18,034
I can try.

383
00:38:18,165 --> 00:38:20,820
You really think we can
tear him away from Paradise.

384
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:24,302
[birds chirping]

385
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:27,957
[footfall]

386
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,535
I like you better
than your man cave.

387
00:38:51,633 --> 00:38:53,896
When was the last time
you ate something?

388
00:38:55,594 --> 00:38:56,943
What do you care?

389
00:39:01,513 --> 00:39:03,732
Let's just say I've seen
what going cold turkey

390
00:39:03,819 --> 00:39:05,299
can do to a person.

391
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:19,531
Where did you get those?

392
00:39:19,618 --> 00:39:20,793
Lets' say
there's a good reason

393
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,447
why you need
to stay out of my tent.

394
00:39:25,406 --> 00:39:27,887
We might as well
have some fun, hadn't we

395
00:39:28,017 --> 00:39:29,105
Before they kill us...

396
00:39:32,021 --> 00:39:33,371
or worse.

397
00:39:46,035 --> 00:39:47,646

[birds chirping]

408
00:42:39,252 --> 00:42:40,601
Is someone enjoying herself?

409
00:42:53,179 --> 00:42:54,528
Sienna.

410
00:42:56,791 --> 00:42:57,792
[silence]

00:43:29,389 --> 00:43:31,783
[birds chirping]

412
00:44:14,086 --> 00:44:14,782
Don't mind me.

413
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,310
Just trying to keep us going.

414
00:44:32,017 --> 00:44:33,322
Sienna.

415
00:44:36,978 --> 00:44:38,937
Hailey, Hailey.

416
00:44:40,155 --> 00:44:41,722
Look at me.

417
00:44:41,766 --> 00:44:42,680
Look at me.

418
00:44:44,203 --> 00:44:45,204
Ow.

419
00:45:13,798 --> 00:45:14,886
Liam.

420
00:45:19,368 --> 00:45:20,718
Liam.

421
00:45:25,984 --> 00:45:26,941
What?

422
00:45:34,427 --> 00:45:35,689
What did you give her?

423
00:45:38,561 --> 00:45:40,825
Look, I've seen
withdrawal before.

424
00:45:40,912 --> 00:45:43,828
Now isn't the time for her
to go cold turkey.

425
00:45:43,915 --> 00:45:46,395
You seem to think
of Sienna better than I do.

426
00:45:47,396 --> 00:45:48,615
You expect me to believe

427
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,399
you did that
for any other reason

428
00:45:50,486 --> 00:45:52,010
than to take advantage of her?

429
00:46:01,846 --> 00:46:04,283
You dose my sister again--

430
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:05,763
And you'll what?

431
00:46:11,943 --> 00:46:15,424
Is there anything else in there
you're hiding from us?

432
00:46:15,511 --> 00:46:16,817
More food, drugs...

433
00:46:18,297 --> 00:46:19,907
weapons?

434
00:46:19,951 --> 00:46:22,301
Any secrets you've got
you should be worried about.

435
00:46:23,868 --> 00:46:25,739
The water is contaminated.

436
00:46:29,525 --> 00:46:30,657
Thought you should know.

437
00:46:31,658 --> 00:46:33,312
Just wait for the rain.

438
00:46:33,442 --> 00:46:34,574
Yeah, what if it doesn't rain?

439
00:46:34,661 --> 00:46:36,837
Yeah, you seem to know it all.

440
00:46:38,317 --> 00:46:40,580
Know of any other freshwater
we could use?

441
00:46:42,234 --> 00:46:44,410
It's a bit of a trek.

442
00:46:44,497 --> 00:46:45,977
I'm going to need a hand.

443
00:46:46,064 --> 00:46:47,108
If you don't think

444
00:46:47,239 --> 00:46:49,067
you could do it by yourself
then let's go.

445
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:51,112
You two can go.

446
00:46:51,243 --> 00:46:52,113
We're staying here

447
00:46:52,244 --> 00:46:53,680
considering
she can't go anywhere.

448
00:46:56,509 --> 00:46:58,032
Josh, can I have a word?

449
00:47:08,564 --> 00:47:09,609
[Hailey] Josh.

450
00:47:11,393 --> 00:47:12,699
Lads night out

451
00:47:16,529 --> 00:47:17,486
[Hailey] Josh.

452
00:47:20,141 --> 00:47:21,012
[Hailey] Listen.

453
00:47:22,143 --> 00:47:23,405
Listen.

454
00:47:25,712 --> 00:47:27,018
[distant bangs in tunnel]

455
00:47:28,497 --> 00:47:30,282
Look.

456
00:47:30,369 --> 00:47:31,500
It's not safe out there.

457
00:47:33,502 --> 00:47:34,808
So, be careful.

458
00:47:36,418 --> 00:47:37,724
Be careful of him.

459
00:47:38,812 --> 00:47:39,857
Hey.

460
00:47:42,511 --> 00:47:43,904
Please.

461
00:47:54,088 --> 00:47:55,437

[forest silence]

465
00:48:37,436 --> 00:48:40,047
Right. I found some things
that can carry water.

466
00:48:41,657 --> 00:48:43,050
We'll line your back with these.

467
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,140
I found this.

468
00:48:52,016 --> 00:48:54,018
You best hang onto this as well.

469
00:48:55,584 --> 00:48:56,585
Come on, partner.

470
00:49:17,693 --> 00:49:19,782

[sobs]

473
00:49:37,278 --> 00:49:37,975
Give me the bottle.

474
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,890
No

475
00:49:40,934 --> 00:49:43,241
-Sienna, give me the bottle.
-No.

476
00:49:43,284 --> 00:49:44,590
-Sienna.
-No.

486
00:51:43,622 --> 00:51:47,887
Hailey said she heard some
of those things earlier.

487
00:51:48,409 --> 00:51:49,758
When?

488
00:51:50,629 --> 00:51:51,934
I don't know.

489
00:51:53,327 --> 00:51:54,372
A few hours.

490
00:51:55,851 --> 00:51:57,375
We better get to move on.

491
00:51:58,941 --> 00:52:01,205
We are in the middle
of the forest.

492
00:52:01,335 --> 00:52:02,989
What could those things want?

493
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:06,079
I dunno mate.

494
00:52:06,166 --> 00:52:08,081
If I were a betting man

495
00:52:08,212 --> 00:52:09,952
I'd say
they're looking for us two.

496
00:52:14,305 --> 00:52:16,655
Do you think we'll make it
back to camp?

497
00:52:18,744 --> 00:52:19,745
We can try.

498
00:52:23,357 --> 00:52:24,402
Come on.

00:52:27,883 --> 00:52:29,233

[Sienna whispers]
What did you do to me?

502
00:53:14,495 --> 00:53:15,975
I can't keep doing this.

503
00:53:18,804 --> 00:53:19,805
I'm tired.

504
00:53:32,687 --> 00:53:33,427
It'll pass.

505
00:53:36,648 --> 00:53:37,344
It always does.

506
00:53:42,523 --> 00:53:43,872
You killed me.

507
00:53:47,093 --> 00:53:48,399
Are you joking?

508
00:53:51,271 --> 00:53:52,794
Sienna, you're killing yourself.

509
00:53:58,322 --> 00:54:00,062
We only have each other, Sienna.

510
00:54:00,149 --> 00:54:01,629
And you keep doing
shit like this.

511
00:54:01,716 --> 00:54:02,891
You're not only gonna get
yourself killed

512
00:54:02,978 --> 00:54:04,284
but me too.

513
00:54:06,895 --> 00:54:08,332
What a shame that would be.

514
00:54:24,565 --> 00:54:26,045
[brooding music]

515
00:54:34,706 --> 00:54:36,360
[Josh]
So you know the forest well?

516
00:54:38,231 --> 00:54:39,841
[Liam] Not bad for a druggie.

517
00:54:41,756 --> 00:54:43,149
[Josh] I never called you that.

518
00:54:43,236 --> 00:54:44,411
But you did drug Sienna.

519
00:54:45,934 --> 00:54:47,980
I didn't force her, mate.

520
00:54:48,023 --> 00:54:49,111
You took advantage.

521
00:54:51,113 --> 00:54:52,289
You knew she was vulnerable.

522
00:54:58,382 --> 00:55:00,297
What are you going to do?
Report me?

523
00:55:02,037 --> 00:55:03,822
I'm not trying to start a fight.

524
00:55:03,952 --> 00:55:05,693
You sure about that?

525
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:07,260
If you was in my position

526
00:55:07,391 --> 00:55:08,740
would you not try to do
the same thing?

527
00:55:08,827 --> 00:55:10,742
I'm just trying to get Sienna
and Hailey to safety.

528
00:55:10,829 --> 00:55:12,091
Safety?

529
00:55:12,178 --> 00:55:14,093
I've taken you three to safety

530
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:16,922
and now I'm taking you to water.

531
00:55:17,009 --> 00:55:19,403
So I'm doing a much better job
than you, mate.

532
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:25,496
That's for Sienna.

533
00:55:27,062 --> 00:55:27,976
Liam, stop.

534
00:55:28,063 --> 00:55:29,587
You two abandoned her.

535
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:30,979
Liam, stop.

536
00:55:31,066 --> 00:55:33,982
I'm just asking you to do
one thing, just one thing.

537
00:55:40,424 --> 00:55:43,296
If something happens to me...

538
00:55:43,383 --> 00:55:45,559
then you're going to be
what they only have.

539
00:55:47,518 --> 00:55:49,520
Let's get the water
and get out of here.

540
00:55:59,617 --> 00:56:00,879
[grunts]

541
00:56:24,816 --> 00:56:25,947
Finally.

542
00:56:27,601 --> 00:56:28,820
Come on.

543
00:56:28,907 --> 00:56:30,430
[water running]

544
00:56:40,222 --> 00:56:41,920
[giggles] It's clear.

545
00:56:43,835 --> 00:56:45,532
I think you're
understanding, mate.

546
00:56:47,795 --> 00:56:49,667
That's going to be
a lot tougher getting back

547
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:52,409
especially carrying
these water bottles.

548
00:56:52,496 --> 00:56:54,585
-It's your--
-Sh, sh, sh.

[ominous music]

550
00:57:08,076 --> 00:57:09,208
She's looking the house.

551
00:57:09,295 --> 00:57:10,601
She will live?

552
00:57:13,473 --> 00:57:14,518
Something is not right.

553
00:57:18,739 --> 00:57:19,958
Be careful.

554
00:57:35,103 --> 00:57:36,975
[sinister tone]

555
00:57:58,257 --> 00:57:59,867
She's been shot.

It's not like you said.
He still has time.

I've seen those things
rip my friends apart.

You have no idea
how dangerous he is.

This is the best thing for him

711
01:17:11,714 --> 01:17:13,454

752
01:28:25,561 --> 01:28:27,954
Liam. No!

753
01:28:28,041 --> 01:28:29,565
She's done nothing for you.

754
01:28:31,654 --> 01:28:33,830
She was going to run away
with that thing

755
01:28:33,916 --> 01:28:35,048
take all of our supplies

756
01:28:35,179 --> 01:28:36,267
and leave us here to run.

757

He's lying, it was for you.

758

I swear, I promise, Sienna.

Make another move,
and I put one in your leg.

To [indistinct] this world.

763

764
01:29:05,209 --> 01:29:07,559
And that's-- [growls]

765
01:29:07,646 --> 01:29:08,343
Hailey.

Sienna, come on.
We have to go.

775
01:30:03,441 --> 01:30:05,400
-Please, get up.
-No.

He was giving lot of shit
helping you.

779
01:30:43,742 --> 01:30:45,657
But you won't be here
if you run.

780
01:30:50,401 --> 01:30:51,489
I'm not going anywhere.

781
01:30:51,532 --> 01:30:53,404
If you're staying, I'm staying.

782

If you're done, I'm done.

783
01:31:08,898 --> 01:31:10,246
Sorry about Josh.

784
01:31:18,995 --> 01:31:20,257
Me too.
