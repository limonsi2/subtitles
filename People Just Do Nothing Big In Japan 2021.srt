00:27:33,445 --> 00:27:35,489
It seems he is their manager.

4
00:27:40,077 --> 00:27:42,871
I didn't know he was coming.
I'll sort it later.

5
00:29:56,755 --> 00:29:57,589
Who are they?

6
00:44:24,414 --> 00:44:26,083
Let's put them even further
back.

7
01:19:09,499 --> 01:19:10,542
Hey, is everything alright?

8
01:19:10,626 --> 01:19:11,627
Yes, I'll find him.

9
01:19:15,088 --> 01:19:15,672
Hurry!

10
01:19:15,756 --> 01:19:16,465
I'll find him.

11
01:19:16,965 --> 01:19:18,800
Don't worry.
He'll get him on stage in time.

12
01:25:23,832 --> 01:25:24,833
OK guys, put your heads on.

13
01:25:25,417 --> 01:25:27,044
We can do this without him.

14
01:25:39,223 --> 01:25:40,891
Grindah needs to be on stage.

15
01:25:54,613 --> 01:25:57,533
-We're going to do this without him.
-You seriously think that's going to work?

16
01:25:58,909 --> 01:26:02,538
Taka knows the dance routine.

17
01:27:02,973 --> 01:27:04,057
WEAR IT!

18
01:28:31,937 --> 01:28:33,605
This is embarrassing.
