(singing in Spanish)

14
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:44,737
Every single day I grind
my way up different levels

15
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:46,239
Different levels

16
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:47,740
(singing in Spanish)

17
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:50,276
Can't nobody tell me nothing

18
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:52,112
(singing in Spanish)

19
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:01,087
-Eagles on one!
-One! Eagles!

20
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:02,288
This is KIHR,
Hood Rover sports radio

21
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:04,157
and this is the moment
you've been waiting for.

22
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:07,127
The start of boys soccer season.

23
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:08,461
-Yes!
-Here we go Eagles!

24
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:09,796
Wow.

25
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:11,030
Goal!

26
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:16,936
It's a windy one out there.

27
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:19,539
Player's jerseys are billowing.

28
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,810
(crowd cheering)

29
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,479
-Goal!
-Here we go!

30
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:29,549
Eagles feature a dynamic group
of stars up and down the lineup.

31
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,384
With the conference
championship and a spot

32
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,319
in the state playoffs looming
as a very real possibility.

33
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:35,221
No!

34
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,322
Oh.

35
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,958
Here's our chance.

36
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:42,529
Goal!

37
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:47,834
Goal!

38
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,202
Angel Sonato.

39
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:52,305
And goal!

40
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:53,806
Woo!

41
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:57,343
(singing in Spanish)

42
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,216
(indistinct team chatter)

43
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:09,889
One, two, three we are Eagles!

44
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:18,998
(wind rustling)

45
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:31,211
(bus humming)

46
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:35,848
(fanfare)

47
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:42,388
Coming in as MVP.

48
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:45,892
(crowd cheering)

49
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,027
I really feel like
the senior class

50
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:50,296
has just a ton
and ton of spirit.

51
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,899
(cheering)

52
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:55,101
So let's show these guys

53
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:57,370
what it means
to have the Eagle beat.

54
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:58,571
Here we go!

55
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:00,873
Who's got the beat?

56
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,143
The mighty Eagle beat,
it goes...

57
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,379
(clapping in unison)

58
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:12,719
Who's got the beat.

59
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:15,154
The mighty eagle beat,
it goes...

60
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,725
(clapping in unison)

61
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,661
(cheering)

62
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,496
Hey guys, we got a real quick
rundown of our fall sports

63
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,099
today for you.

64
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:28,434
So right now, I'd like
our boys varsity soccer players

65
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:31,638
to stand up real quick,
boys varsity soccer.

66
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:35,575
(cheering)

67
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,744
They're ranked number one
in the state.

68
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,411
Nice job boys soccer.

69
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:44,083
(cheering)

70
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,120
(indistinct chatter)

71
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:01,601
Three, two and time.

72
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:05,371
So now we've got two attackers
on the sides.

73
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,206
Depending where the forward is

74
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,875
maybe he turns and shoots.

75
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,477
Or maybe he plays the ball out
and we get across.

76
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:13,513
Hood River Valley
high school boys soccer

77
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:16,115
is a big part of our community.

78
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:18,518
(speaking Spanish)

79
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:23,623
It's probably the most popular
sport in Hood River.

80
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,726
There's a lot of talent
on this team.

81
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,227
We have a shot at winning
our division

82
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,629
and then maybe
even making some noise

83
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,164
-in the state playoffs.
-Goal scored over here.

84
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,799
You have two goals
to score on, guys.

85
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:34,667
Play, play, play.

86
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:38,037
The team is sort of
broken up right now.

87
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:40,573
Some of the Anglo kids certainly
tend to stick to one group

88
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,975
and then there's like another
group of Mexican kids

89
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:45,311
who maybe don't speak
as good of English.

90
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:48,247
(speaking Spanish)

91
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,650
We gotta finish!
Keep it crispy, guys.

92
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:52,585
When I first went
to kindergarten,

93
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,421
I like saw this divide
where like all right,

94
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,523
Mexicans versus the white kids.

95
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,827
(kicking soccer ball)

96
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:04,430
At the time, we didn't really
think it was like bad, you know.

97
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,433
But like you still see it
in high school too.

98
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,605
There's another goal,
there's another goal.

99
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,408
Monday through Friday we're all
on the soccer field together

100
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:19,178
and it's my job to get those two
groups to work together

101
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:20,179
on the same team.

102
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:20,780
Yes! I like that.

103
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,615
Yes, yes.

104
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,184
I dream about that last night.

105
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:26,552
I'm serious.

106
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:31,357
(machine beeping)

107
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:57,483
We came back to here from Mexico

108
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,253
cause we have
a lot of family here.

109
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:12,265
My mom came with refugee visa.

110
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:17,069
And my dad,
he came under the border.

111
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:19,739
(speaking Spanish)

112
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:23,342
(heavy breathing)

113
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:29,115
I have some plans for the future
but I don't like school.

114
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:30,750
The biggest reason
that I'm still going

115
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:33,920
is cause I love soccer.

116
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:37,123
(guitar music)

117
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:22,502
I kind of started making
my meals in the mornings

118
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:26,072
two months ago.

119
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,807
As soon as I started
tracking what I was eating

120
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,175
I realized that it could help me

121
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:32,311
play soccer
a lot better than I was.

122
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:34,747
And I felt
so much better lately.

123
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,149
-Hi Dad.
-Hey, bud, so how long

124
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:38,651
does this whole meal prep
thing now usually take?

125
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,520
It was a train wreck
the first time.

126
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:42,722
The first time was pretty bad,
now I like--I'm probably

127
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:45,691
20 minutes out, 30 minutes out.

128
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:48,327
So.

129
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:49,695
Where did you get
the recipe again?

130
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:51,697
Some video,
YouTube or something?

131
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:53,599
Some bodybuilder, yeah.

132
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,502
But I had changed it
a little bit.

133
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,738
Okay.

134
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,376
Sometimes I get frustrated
with my teammates.

135
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:05,211
It seems pretty obvious to me,
like yeah,

136
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:06,679
you guys ate Twinkies
before the game.

137
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:10,182
And you got two hours of sleep
last night.

138
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:13,352
Like, no shit
we don't play well.

139
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:16,022
But a lot of these kids, like
that's all they've ever known.

140
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:19,191
They don't have the money
to pay for really good food.

141
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:21,027
They don't have parents
who preach to them

142
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:23,963
how important sleep is.

143
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,972
Domingo!

144
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,207
Push up, push up!

145
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:36,876
Let's go! Get up.

146
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:39,579
Make it work Mingo.

147
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:41,213
Stop walking, let's go.

148
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,450
Push up! Push up!
One more, one more.

149
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,386
It's so important for me
to be able to have an impact

150
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,655
on those guys.

151
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:53,392
But if they show up late,
they don't wear the right gear,

152
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:56,495
they don't care,
it's really discouraging.

153
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,064
Hey, Saul, come on.

154
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,599
You're literally walking, dude.

155
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:02,068
Don't ever catch
yourself walking.

156
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,236
It's really fucking tiring
when you're the only one

157
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:05,771
-that's running.
-I know it does, dude.

158
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:09,742
I'm in that position
every single practice.

159
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,778
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

160
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,855
(dogs barking)

161
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:32,264
My mom works
at the juice factory.

162
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:33,933
She's amazing.

163
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,537
I love my mom.

164
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,640
My dad, he doesn't have
like education.

165
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:46,312
He doesn't have
a high school diploma

166
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,648
but he's my inspiration.

167
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:31,023
(school bus humming)

168
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,926
(uplifting music)

169
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,541
-Eyy!
-Yo, actually put that beat

170
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,109
back on I like that.

171
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,780
Just went from overlooked
to overbooked

172
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,682
My (indistinct lyrics)
is overcooked

173
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:58,384
Only spit verses,
ain't got no hook

174
00:11:58,451 --> 00:11:59,952
Said it couldn't be done
so I undertook

175
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:04,623
(inaudible rapping)

176
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,058
Yeah!

177
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:12,898
Bro, I can't come up with--

178
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:16,202
(laughing)

179
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:17,536
Dude.

180
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:19,705
Ugh.

181
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,574
Who's next?

182
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,908
Fuck yeah.

183
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:27,413
Number 21, a junior, Robbie
(inaudible).

184
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,882
This is not a time to just come
out here and score eight goals

185
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:32,151
-and then we leave.
-Saul Chavarria.

186
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,886
We've got better dribbling,
we've got better skills.

187
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,054
But we've got to make
combination play, you guys.

188
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:39,225
All right? We have to get
ready for Woodburn, dudes.

189
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:42,228
A senior, Erik Siekkinen.

190
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:45,231
That is your Hood River Valley
Eagles.

191
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:46,398
-Eagles on one.
-One!

192
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:49,668
Eagles!

193
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:50,936
KIHR Hood River sports radio.

194
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:54,573
-Home of the Eagles.
-Let's go guys.

195
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,575
Move the ball around guys,
move the ball around.

196
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:59,578
Move the ball around,
just like practice, guys.

197
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:04,917
(crowd cheering)

198
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:06,952
Shoot. Move the ball!

199
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,754
If we just continue to dribble

200
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:12,258
we're gonna draw more defenders,
right.

201
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:13,692
Hustling for the goal,

202
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:14,960
Erik Quintones takes a hard
fall.

203
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:16,996
Referees calling a foul.

204
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:21,934
(cheering)

205
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,269
Goal!

206
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,104
Nice. Good, good.

207
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:26,605
(indistinct chatter)

208
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,477
Robbie, Quintones!

209
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:34,613
(intense music)

210
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:38,717
Get the ball, look inside!

211
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,888
Who's the 45?
He needs a better 45 than that.

212
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:46,125
Saul Chavarria with the passing
and the (rapid game commentary)

213
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:47,226
Goal!

214
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:47,893
Erik Siekkinen.

215
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,131
Yes Wesley!

216
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:55,067
Wesley Carter with a blast,
he scores!

217
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:55,835
That's a goal.

218
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:59,071
Sub, can we get a sub?

219
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:03,642
Domingo. Let's finish it off
for Fabian.

220
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:04,977
Hustle, dude.

221
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:10,983
Sal Chavarria
(rapid play calling)

222
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,151
Here we go!

223
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:13,752
Goal!

224
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,054
Another great pass
and Saul and Barragan

225
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,989
won't miss many of those.

226
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:21,260
(cheering)

227
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,095
(buzzer)

228
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,864
The Eagles systematically
dismantle

229
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:29,668
the Pendleton Buckaroos to
remain on top of the division.

230
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:33,005
Still undefeated
but largely untested.

231
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:44,516
Oh, 11!

232
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,252
Dude, these shoes are like--

233
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:48,854
I got you beat, brother.

234
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:51,190
Check my touch.

235
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:54,927
Dude, I've hit like what? 300.

236
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:58,230
Hood River,
it's either one or two ways.

237
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,132
Count for me I'm with 21.

238
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:03,235
You just work hard worrying
about the next bill.

239
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:05,537
Worrying about the next payment

240
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:07,907
or you live in Hood River
and then you're worrying about

241
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:12,311
the next biking trip
or the next like, ski trip.

242
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,714
It's a good place to live
if you have money.

243
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:17,816
Most of the white kids
all just be like,

244
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,818
"Oh, where are you going
for like, Thanksgiving break?"

245
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,387
It's like,
"I'm staying here, man."

246
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:22,388
Like, we're not going anywhere.

247
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:25,090
And like, all of them
go to like freaking,

248
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:28,794
Park City or like Whistler

249
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:30,729
and all that stuff.

250
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:32,398
And it's cool and then they all
go to the mountains and stuff

251
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:33,399
but we just hang around here

252
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:35,334
and just play footie.

253
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,269
Oh my god.

254
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,171
If you don't know anyone here
in Hood River

255
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,573
and you don't have money
then you're kind of like...

256
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,908
just here.

257
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:55,354
(indistinct chatter)

258
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:07,599
All right, Erik, Travis, you
have three minutes prep time.

259
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,301
Three minutes starting now.

260
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:13,005
Freaky, this is about
to get freaky.

261
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:15,975
Yeah, Robbie's gonna win this.

262
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,142
That was five minutes.

263
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:19,044
I'm gonna have to wing it.

264
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,045
I have one bar.

265
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,815
-I'll start, I'll start.
-We need a group name.

266
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:27,219
Wait, one minute
to create of group name.

267
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,554
-Red--
-White Rice!

268
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,121
White Rice!

269
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,158
-Ready?
-Okay.

270
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:35,160
Coming real hot
come and seeky

271
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:37,463
Yeah, I'm doing this weekly

272
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,798
It's about to get freaky

273
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:40,499
You say you got the sauce

274
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:43,635
But I just say you're leaky

275
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:47,906
(laughing)

276
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,641
All right, everybody be quiet,
everybody be quiet.

277
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:50,809
Everybody be quiet.

278
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:51,977
Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet.

279
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:52,544
Get out of there.

280
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:54,980
My name is Robby

281
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:56,081
Rapping's just a hobby

282
00:16:56,181 --> 00:17:00,819
Erik isn't even
in my freaking lobby

283
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:02,921
Yo, we're White Rice

284
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:06,091
We're pretty nice

285
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,160
I got a lot of ice

286
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,496
(laughing)

287
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:12,097
You guys just lost.

288
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,199
Yeah Kiki,
you're looking like a boy

289
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:16,101
You need to eat some more

290
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:19,004
You need to eat
some more soy

291
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:22,441
Oh! Woah.

292
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,277
His name is Erik and he...

293
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,846
Soccer ball
but little does he know

294
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:29,848
His starting position's
about to fall

295
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:31,917
Oh!

296
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:36,188
Woah! She just said you'll
be on the bench, Erik!

297
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,457
Cover your ears.

298
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:42,127
Erik, you are pretty lazy

299
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,863
Those muscles
don't get ladies

300
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:45,130
Just ask Katie

301
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,467
Oh!

302
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:52,237
(laughing)

303
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,073
Oh!

304
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:57,543
Erik, you are the bitch
of the squad

305
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:01,313
And just like these chords
they're slim as his quad

306
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:04,249
You already know that
your starting game is week

307
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:06,718
Player of the year

308
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:08,387
You know Angel's
got you beat

309
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:10,322
Oh!

310
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:14,059
(laughing)

311
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:17,563
(indistinct chatter)

312
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:21,900
Yo, what was crazy dude.

313
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,168
I've been thinking about making
a fitness account for a while

314
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:27,139
cause I've been working
pretty hard at the gym.

315
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:30,809
Pretty much everyday
I go to soccer practice

316
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:32,678
and then I go to the gym
and then my dad helps me

317
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,280
with my--my, uh, homework.

318
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:39,151
(lively music)

319
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:42,187
Erik, you can't beat him

320
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,924
Oh my god!

321
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,296
When I moved here
I was nine years old.

322
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:54,533
It was super tough, I didn't
really have any friends.

323
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,301
In the fourth grade
my mom was like,

324
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:58,170
"You're too smart for
these people around here, so

325
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:01,707
I was homeschooled."

326
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:06,011
My mom homeschooled me cause she
didn't like my teacher.

327
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,479
So when I got into middle school

328
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,214
from a social standpoint
I was terrified.

329
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,953
(heavy breathing)

330
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:17,623
I had friends but I didn't have

331
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:19,191
like a really,
really good friend.

332
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:28,400
It didn't take long for me
to lose my confidence.

333
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,371
I was just basically afraid.

334
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:34,840
I remember praying about it.

335
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,078
Like, I was lost, you know.

336
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:52,357
(crows cawing)

337
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:56,695
(thunder rumbling)

338
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:18,617
(rain pattering)

339
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:24,523
(dramatic music)

340
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:32,364
My dad, he didn't
make a stop correctly

341
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,266
and got arrested.

342
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,372
They took him
to an immigration jail.

343
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:45,277
Now he's fighting
to not get deported.

344
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:29,755
(coughing)

345
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:32,691
(solemn music)

346
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:46,772
(car starting)

347
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:49,308
That's it, he got deported.

348
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:59,384
(thunder rumbling)

349
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:08,387
(water running)

350
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:12,257
(water splashing)

351
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:25,370
All right, 15 second sprint, go!

352
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:25,737
Let's go, boys.

353
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:27,472
(clapping)

354
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:30,375
Let's go, let's go,
come on, let's go boys.

355
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:33,044
Come on, anybody can sprint
for 15 seconds.

356
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:38,984
Let's go, Mingo.

357
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:42,487
(heavy breathing)

358
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:49,661
One minute break.

359
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:53,231
Ugh.

360
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:54,833
How's this warmup for you,
Galvez.

361
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,402
This is what we do
after our 1Ks.

362
00:23:57,469 --> 00:24:00,238
(coughing)

363
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:03,909
(indistinct chatter)

364
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:26,465
(guitar music)

365
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,204
(drumming music)

366
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:40,772
KIHR Hood River sports radio.

367
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,608
Home of the Eagles.

368
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:47,612
Coach Jamie Rivera called
into our AM Morning Show

369
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:50,015
to talk about what this game
means for the team

370
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:51,683
and for the season.

371
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,018
At this point in our season,

372
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:53,952
every game is a championship.

373
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:57,188
Because if you don't win
then you go home.

374
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:58,857
(indistinct conversation)

375
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:00,458
And if someone's lagging
behind yell at him.

376
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,193
If it's me, yell at me.

377
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,228
People make sure I'm on the guy.

378
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:05,130
If I'm late...

379
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,198
(chanting)

380
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:08,199
-Eagles on one!
-One!

381
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:09,034
Eagles!

382
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,804
Let's play some
Hood River soccer.

383
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:17,709
Keep tight, nice and tight.

384
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:20,245
Win this!

385
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:20,812
No turn, Robbie!

386
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,582
One and two touch.

387
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:28,386
The Eagles moving the ball
to the Hermiston territory

388
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:29,721
for the first time this game.

389
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:33,224
(cheering)

390
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:36,828
Keep them there!

391
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,963
Go Erik!

392
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:40,565
Siekkinen goes to clear
and he misses and the ball rolls

393
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:41,266
dangerously through the crease.

394
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:44,235
Win it back! Win it back! Erik!

395
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:45,904
Erik back on defense
but he trips and falls

396
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:47,572
and they score.

397
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:51,643
(indistinct chatter)

398
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:57,248
Some smart, aggressive gameplay
on the part of Hermiston

399
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:59,084
seems to have confused
the Eagles.

400
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,519
There's a lot of effort
but not a lot of team work.

401
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,755
Hey, keep it buzzing all right?
Keep it buzzing.

402
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:05,423
-One nothing Hermiston.
-Watch your body language,

403
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,092
-watch your body language.
-I'm pissed off

404
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:09,961
at how I'm playing,
I want to yell at our team

405
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:12,631
because I'm mad
about our intensity.

406
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:13,798
I need every single one
of you guys to give 100 percent

407
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:17,869
of your effort every single time
you're in the game.

408
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:18,670
Can you guys do that for me?

409
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,639
Yeah?

410
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:24,109
Yeah.

411
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:26,811
Play resumes with 22:30
left on the clock.

412
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:30,448
(cheering)

413
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:34,319
Plenty of time, plenty of time.

414
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:36,655
(intense music)

415
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:41,826
One and two touch guys!

416
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,997
Siekkinen goes go clear
and he misses and the ball rolls

417
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:47,565
dangerously through the crease.

418
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:48,667
Win it back!

419
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,042
Hey, that's a quarter!

420
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:59,477
Yeah, let's get it,
let's go boys.

421
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:01,479
6:53 left in the game
and the Eagles are going to

422
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:02,914
start running out of options.

423
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:09,854
(indistinct chatter)

424
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:16,494
Erik!

425
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:16,828
Goal!

426
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:19,764
(cheering)

427
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:23,001
(indistinct cheering)

428
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:29,274
Eagles scramming
for a quick follow up goal

429
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:33,611
to salvage the game.

430
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:34,713
And Erik Siekkinen
in the final seconds

431
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:37,582
is just a few steps behind.

432
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:38,083
(clapping)

433
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:42,520
(whistle blowing)

434
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:46,191
(solemn music)

435
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:09,414
(rain pattering)

436
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:13,251
(dog barking)

437
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:19,758
Nobody likes me right now, man.

438
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:19,891
Erik!

439
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:22,927
Good.

440
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:26,731
Go threes.

441
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:45,416
Mingo didn't get the message
that it was at four here.

442
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:47,085
So that's why he's late.

443
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:47,852
You know about his father,
right?

444
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:48,820
Yeah, it's hard.

445
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,260
And last one, here we go,
here we go, here we go.

446
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:58,596
Give it away.

447
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:00,498
Guys we're moving right
into another activity.

448
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:03,034
Here we go, we're going to go
one V ones in these lanes here.

449
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:06,504
We're working on
defending the player

450
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:08,640
that's attacking at speed.

451
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:09,207
You win the ball

452
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,276
you counter all the way

453
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:13,178
to the end of the lane here.

454
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:15,213
Don't just win the ball
and then walk off.

455
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,648
That's not the game.

456
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:19,617
Let's see Erik, let's see, Erik.

457
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:21,386
Erik, what'd I just say?

458
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,621
Erik, 50 burpees

459
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:29,494
for not doing
what I just asked you to do.

460
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:30,829
(heavy breathing)

461
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:35,800
You guys gotta listen
to the instructions, guys.

462
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:36,401
On the whistle.

463
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:40,305
Erik.

464
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:42,040
That's shit defending, man.

465
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,076
If you got him like this there's
no way he's cutting behind.

466
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,912
He's just going to hit it long
and you got him there.

467
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:51,149
Erik?

468
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:51,983
Erik.

469
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,651
(thunder rumbling)

470
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:54,018
Just go now.

471
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:58,089
Just leave.

472
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:03,027
(rain pattering)

473
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:06,531
(thunder rumbling)

474
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,338
(crickets chirping)

475
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:53,972
(guitar music)

476
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:13,992
(indistinct plane announcement)

477
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:40,184
Papa.

478
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:43,388
(sobbing)

479
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:35,072
(crying)

480
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:46,984
(solemn guitar music)

481
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:29,193
(upbeat live music)

482
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:42,540
(banging)

483
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,943
(guitar music)

484
00:35:57,355 --> 00:35:58,122
(singing in Spanish)

485
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:53,110
And I

486
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,781
Haven't lost my mind

487
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,350
Thinking about you

488
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:04,455
Manny's with us today right?

489
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,691
Lesley's not playing.

490
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:08,526
Lodi can't play.

491
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:09,460
Domingo's out.

492
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,463
-Why isn't he on the bus?
-What's that?

493
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,298
Why is he not on the bus?

494
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,534
You know about his father right?

495
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:18,402
-I don't.
-His father was deported

496
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:19,470
to Mexico.

497
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:25,243
He just doesn't say
a whole lot, you know.

498
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:28,913
Like, sometimes I feel like
he just comes

499
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,648
and he doesn't feel like
he's part of the team sometimes.

500
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,883
I'm not putting that on him
but I think sometimes

501
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,952
we don't accept him as like...

502
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:38,322
Even though Domingo doesn't
speak the best English

503
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:41,559
some words of encouragement
to him would go a long ways

504
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:43,327
-right now because...
-A lot of people on this team

505
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:46,063
that would help him out but he's
gotta actually want it.

506
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,431
I think that's where
the team comes in right?

507
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:50,901
That's where you guys need to...

508
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:52,570
I mean, imagine how he feels.

509
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:54,272
We should be doing what
we can to help him

510
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:58,909
stay eligible and motivated,
right?

511
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:00,177
Yeah.

512
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:11,188
Oh my god, I feel like I'm
somewhere in like East Coast

513
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:14,425
Wait, this is a high school?

514
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:17,528
KIHR Hood River sports radio

515
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:19,297
coming to you today from
the Atkinson Community Stadium

516
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:21,599
in Franklin, Oregon.

517
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:23,200
Where the Franklin Quakers
will host

518
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:26,103
the Hood River Valley Eagles
later today.

519
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,772
With the season winding down
the statistics

520
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:30,107
become increasingly important.

521
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:31,942
A tie or worse, a loss,

522
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:33,778
could shuffle the rankings.

523
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:35,546
And either force
a division playoff

524
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,948
or eliminate
the Eagles completely.

525
00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:38,616
Tails it is.

526
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:40,017
Kick-off or end?

527
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:45,323
Let's go Eagles!

528
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:47,625
Franklin looking to extend
a four-game winning streak.

529
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:50,961
Eagles remain undefeated
with one tie.

530
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:52,563
Two much space between
the back line and Robby.

531
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,999
Roc be the middle guy.

532
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:57,401
Hey, hey, hey!

533
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:03,407
(indistinct instructions)

534
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:06,477
Keep moving the ball.

535
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:09,480
Refs call a penalty number 18,
Angel Sonato.

536
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:11,048
Shit.

537
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:11,716
Hey, let's go, let's go.

538
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:15,653
How is that a balanced call?

539
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,188
Let's go Eagles.

540
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:19,824
Come on, bring it Alex.

541
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:22,159
And here comes the kick.

542
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:27,164
(cheering)

543
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:29,033
Alex Rodriguez
has a beautiful save.

544
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,168
Two in a row
and the Eagles recover.

545
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:32,837
(cheering)

546
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:35,506
Team Caption, Saul Chavarria
countering up the field

547
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:38,042
and comes crashing down.

548
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:41,078
Are you kidding me?

549
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:43,447
Incredibly aggressive gameplay
on the part of both teams.

550
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:46,217
Still no score.

551
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:47,852
And he's like that's not a foul.

552
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:49,520
I was like what the--
and then the next play

553
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:51,622
I went like this to him
and he called a foul on me.

554
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:54,291
Fucking stupid as hell.

555
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,627
Our rhythm is totally
screwed up.

556
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,362
Stop dribbling so dang much

557
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:02,199
and show you guys
want this win. Okay?

558
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:03,768
Let's make them look
like children boys.

559
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:05,035
-Eagles on one!
-One!

560
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:06,971
Eagles.

561
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:10,408
Both teams trying anxiously
to avoid a tie,

562
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:14,078
or worse, a loss.

563
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:15,780
Go, get on that,
come on, come on.

564
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,882
(indistinct remarks)

565
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:20,885
Get set up!

566
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,755
Flying into counter attack,
the ball's in the box,

567
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:26,590
and goal!

568
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:28,826
Saul Chavarria gets
a head on it.

569
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:32,062
Eagles on the board with
under two minutes remaining.

570
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:32,730
Franklin incoming
for what could be

571
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:36,267
the last play of the game.

572
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:38,569
And it's a handball,
a handball call

573
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:39,670
against the Eagles.

574
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:43,240
Come on, dude, they've gotten
two penalties already.

575
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:44,575
Two.

576
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:47,845
Scoop it.

577
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,346
(whistle blowing)

578
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,448
Here comes the shot.

579
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,587
Franklin has tied the game
with seconds on the clock.

580
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:59,089
(whistle blowing)

581
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:01,358
Saul Chavarria with
a last desperate attempt.

582
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,860
(buzzing)

583
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,528
The clock runs out
on an intense second half.

584
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:06,931
(grunting)

585
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:08,432
(cheering)

586
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:09,700
(indistinct remarks)

587
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:16,373
(indistinct remarks)

588
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,442
Let's go, let's go.

589
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:23,948
Heads up, boys, heads up,
forget about it.

590
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:25,549
Poor communication
and a little bit of bad luck

591
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,718
on the part of the Eagles
have the division championship

592
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:31,055
slipping through their fingers.

593
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:39,463
(buzzing)

594
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:47,338
You know what, guys, come here,
all of you guys, come here.

595
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:50,074
Yeah.

596
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:54,678
You guys realize that
if there would to be

597
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:58,148
another tie,
or a potential loss,

598
00:41:58,215 --> 00:42:01,151
the conference championship
is not secure?

599
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:03,420
You guys understand that, right?

600
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,489
Angel, come on,
this is not funny, dude.

601
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:06,657
I'm--I'm being serious.

602
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:08,592
If you don't wanna
take this seriously,

603
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:09,527
you can just excuse yourself
from the meeting here.

604
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,431
We gotta pick it up, boys.

605
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,500
Let's go, let's go.

606
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:18,002
Get your 11 on each side,
let's go.

607
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:19,904
So, are you--are you hurt?

608
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:21,872
Just step off, you can turn
if you want them to.

609
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:24,008
Well, if you're really hurt,
then get off the fucking field.

610
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:25,709
-Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
-If you're going to play,

611
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:27,378
-then play.
-All right, that's what I'm--

612
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:28,879
That's what
I'm telling you, dude.

613
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:30,948
-It's fine, dude.
-If you're hurt, then leave--

614
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:31,882
-Why are you telling me that?
-Because I didn't play.

615
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:34,552
Just fucking chill, dude,
Jesus Christ.

616
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:35,786
-Yeah, bro, if you can't, then--
-I'm telling him

617
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:38,789
I'm gonna try it.

618
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:39,857
Yeah.

619
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,860
As a--as a team, like--

620
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:43,761
We can't really play
with each other this year.

621
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:46,730
That's one, yep.

622
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:49,366
It's like--it's like chemistry,

623
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:52,236
and right now we're, like,
at 45 percent chemistry

624
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:54,038
-out of 100.
-Uh, like 50.

625
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:55,573
Gather all the goals.

626
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:58,709
You guys are making me mad.

627
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:01,078
(whistle chirping)

628
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,550
-A-ha, get 'em.
-Yes.

629
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:09,386
You guys--Angel, Angel,
take this seriously.

630
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:11,555
-Dude, it was going over--
-Take this seriously.

631
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:14,224
Don't be laughing around,
and don't call me "dude."

632
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:15,659
Come here, come here,
you're not gonna

633
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:17,761
talk to me that way.

634
00:43:17,828 --> 00:43:18,662
-Yeah.
-Get over here!

635
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:27,771
(indistinct remarks)

636
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:29,607
Good luck.

637
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,514
Ow, shit.

638
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,683
Oh, be careful.

639
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:41,685
Oh, I sliced myself pretty good.

640
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:42,686
Oh, you got Band-Aids?

641
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:43,821
-Yeah.
-Where's your Band-Aids?

642
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:45,623
Yeah.

643
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:48,192
Wanna take 'em to Daddy?
Here.

644
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,860
I try to approach things
pretty similar every year.

645
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,595
You're welcome, sweetheart.

646
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:52,663
But, I can't get
everyone on the same page.

647
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:55,532
(squeaking)

648
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,434
-It's very frustrating to watch.
-Well, he wants

649
00:43:57,501 --> 00:43:59,269
to play basketball in there.

650
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:00,971
(crying)

651
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:02,640
Hit it.

652
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:03,874
-Nice.
-Wow.

653
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:07,478
Maybe I've been doing things
the wrong way this whole season.

654
00:44:07,544 --> 00:44:10,447
(laughing)

655
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:31,468
(sobbing)

656
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,354
Latest weather winds out
out of the west

657
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:51,889
at 10 miles an hour...

658
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:52,923
(indistinct intercom remarks)

659
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:08,072
(birds chirping)

660
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:17,548
(speaking Spanish)

661
00:45:17,614 --> 00:45:20,951
Get all that right now
before we get going.

662
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,853
So, I've got my opinions.

663
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,754
I'm sure you guys
all have your opinions

664
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:25,723
in reflection now,
what are some things

665
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:29,193
that we could've done better.

666
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:30,794
I've been thinking
about this a lot,

667
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:33,030
and I have to own up to it.

668
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:34,965
I trust the hell
out of this team,

669
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:39,570
it's just that we--our own heads
get in our way sometimes.

670
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:42,372
Okay, I need to
take responsibility

671
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:43,807
as your head coach,
because I need

672
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:46,810
your guys's help, too.

673
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:50,080
It's--we've gotta
make a change, dudes.

674
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:53,150
Okay, and again, it starts--
it starts with me.

675
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,918
Okay, but it can't just be me.

676
00:45:56,553 --> 00:45:58,822
Leave the past to be the past,

677
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:01,959
and we have to start writing
a new--a new story today.

678
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:03,560
So--are you guys with me?

679
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:04,928
You boys in this?

680
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:08,398
Okay, all right,
I'm all in with you guys,

681
00:46:08,465 --> 00:46:10,000
okay, for the rest
of this season.

682
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:15,072
(whirring)

683
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:23,680
(speaking Spanish)

684
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:35,592
Yeah, exactly, exactly, so.

685
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:36,960
"To the person
with more experience,

686
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:38,428
like a police officer,
so he can give me

687
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:40,364
a better opinion."

688
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,966
I like it, you're okay,
so do (speaking Spanish.

689
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:52,943
Eh?

690
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:01,385
(clanking)

691
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:12,830
(thudding)

692
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:16,066
(clanking)

693
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,734
5,500.

694
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,136
My dad and my mom,
they've always been

695
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:21,138
in leadership positions.

696
00:47:23,373 --> 00:47:26,310
I just assumed that
I could be a leader, too.

697
00:47:29,713 --> 00:47:30,914
(crickets chirping)

698
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,083
(sloshing)

699
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:38,322
(beeping)

700
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:39,823
You ready?

701
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:40,390
-All right, I got it, I got it.
-Let go.

702
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:42,659
All right, all right.

703
00:47:42,726 --> 00:47:43,994
(grunting)

704
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:46,830
Yes, let's go, buddy!

705
00:47:46,897 --> 00:47:48,031
-Woo!
-Oh, look at those pull-ups.

706
00:47:48,098 --> 00:47:50,767
I've done, like,
three actual ones.

707
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:53,670
Yeah, do it, that was good.

708
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:55,005
Yeah, you hustling or what?

709
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:57,507
(grunt)

710
00:47:57,574 --> 00:47:58,275
There's a reason
you're a captain, Alec.

711
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,510
-Yeah.
-Obviously you're gonna be

712
00:48:00,577 --> 00:48:02,679
one of the leaders,
just the way you lead

713
00:48:02,746 --> 00:48:04,348
has to change, to be honest.

714
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:05,883
Long speeches
where you're telling people

715
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:08,018
how to prepare stuff,
they just don't work.

716
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:11,021
You don't just
go up to someone and say,

717
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:11,955
"This is why you're bad."

718
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:15,525
Like, someone's willing
to listen to you

719
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:17,127
if you tell them,
"Yeah, you're playing bad

720
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:19,730
because of this,"
but you've built up the--

721
00:48:19,796 --> 00:48:22,199
to the point where they know
that you're giving them advice,

722
00:48:22,266 --> 00:48:24,534
and so you gotta, like, get that

723
00:48:24,601 --> 00:48:26,803
out of your, like, head,
that you need to fix everyone,

724
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,305
-because you're not.
-I was talking to my dad

725
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:28,972
about it, and he was,
like, talking about

726
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:31,875
servant leadership.

727
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:33,076
-Yeah.
-Because it's something that

728
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:34,044
he does a lot,
at his job at least,

729
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:37,748
and that's, like,
a leader is a servant

730
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:38,982
to the people that he's leading.

731
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:41,551
-Yeah, like--
-Right, and so it's, like,

732
00:48:41,618 --> 00:48:44,821
me going out of my way
to do the extra nice thing

733
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:45,956
for the other person,
and not to make it, like,

734
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:49,826
a racial thing,
but I think that--

735
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:50,994
You just did by saying that.

736
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:53,096
Okay, well to make it
a racial thing,

737
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:56,733
the soccer field
is where they thrive.

738
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,069
-Mhm.
-Where--where it's like--

739
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:02,072
you know, and I think
that I almost disrespected them

740
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:04,574
in a way by coming out there

741
00:49:04,641 --> 00:49:07,911
and pretending like
I know more than they do.

742
00:49:07,978 --> 00:49:09,012
That's how they feel
on a daily basis,

743
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:12,015
so then you making that--
putting that on them

744
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,183
makes them, like,
feel even more--

745
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:15,018
They're like, "Ah, Erik's good
in school and all this,

746
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:17,587
but I'm better at soccer,"
then you come out

747
00:49:17,654 --> 00:49:19,423
and you tell 'em what to do,

748
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:20,958
and, like,
your position as a captain,

749
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:23,293
they'll be like,
"Well, fuck this guy."

750
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,996
You just--that's how
you're gonna be a suc--

751
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:27,030
a successful leader, you know?

752
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:30,867
For one, leading by example,
and for two, like,

753
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,769
reaching out to those guys
that you wouldn't tend to

754
00:49:32,836 --> 00:49:35,772
ever talk to in practice, like,
I don't know Mige or Mingo,

755
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:37,140
and you know,
you gotta find a way to, like,

756
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:39,142
break that barrier.

757
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,215
(whirring)

758
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:54,624
(indistinct intercom remarks)

759
00:49:58,195 --> 00:50:01,465
(whirring)

760
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:13,810
(speaking Spanish)

761
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:53,283
(whirring)

762
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,188
Attendance has been
a lot better.

763
00:50:58,255 --> 00:51:00,690
(indistinct remarks)

764
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:02,692
That looks really good.

765
00:51:02,759 --> 00:51:05,862
So, you were a tardy in--
on Monday, but that is

766
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:06,630
really good attendance.

767
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,065
We need to use this
as motivation.

768
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:11,535
Domingo, you're almost there,
but you're not done.

769
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:14,137
So, you have a lot of credits
still to do, Domingo.

770
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:17,541
You have five credits
and your EA project to finish

771
00:51:17,607 --> 00:51:19,876
to graduate.

772
00:51:19,943 --> 00:51:21,144
(indistinct remarks)

773
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:24,247
Yeah.

774
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:41,765
(singing in Spanish)

775
00:51:48,972 --> 00:51:51,308
(whirring)

776
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,913
Like, flying it
is multicolored--

777
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,348
Honestly, though, dude,
I really don't like

778
00:51:58,448 --> 00:51:59,416
how they don't do
carbon fiber anymore.

779
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:01,751
-Yeah, they did carbon on--
-Dude, yeah, they--

780
00:52:01,818 --> 00:52:03,487
Why did they stop doing that?
I don't know.

781
00:52:03,587 --> 00:52:05,255
-What do you think, buddy?
-Sick, dude.

782
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:07,090
-Not like this?
-No, let's buy him

783
00:52:07,157 --> 00:52:08,758
one of those poufy jackets,
have you seen those?

784
00:52:08,825 --> 00:52:10,127
Dude, like these?

785
00:52:10,193 --> 00:52:12,362
-Yeah, large.
-Extra small, extra small,

786
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:14,965
extra small, extra small.

787
00:52:15,031 --> 00:52:16,466
-Oh, these are not bad, dude.
-Oh, yeah, those are really--

788
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:18,602
They only have smalls.

789
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:20,537
-We could go to Far Post.
-Oh, that's true.

790
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:23,940
(singing in Spanish)

791
00:52:34,017 --> 00:52:35,485
These are dope.

792
00:52:35,552 --> 00:52:37,387
Oh, yeah, these are all cheap,
yeah, they, like--

793
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:39,389
-Oh, that one was nice.
-Those ones are really--

794
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:42,125
-The ones that are not quite--
-I'd cop these for indoor.

795
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:43,627
So, what about this?

796
00:52:43,693 --> 00:52:45,629
-That's good.
-That's good, dude.

797
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:46,997
-That's a good color, too.
-Rob, Rob, let's do this one.

798
00:52:47,063 --> 00:52:48,632
-Yeah.
-We'll split it.

799
00:52:48,698 --> 00:52:50,467
-Split it?
-Yeah, we'll split it,

800
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:52,969
-I'm gonna pay for it.
-I'll pinch in for that, too.

801
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:55,972
(overlapping remarks)

802
00:52:56,039 --> 00:52:57,374
'Cause his shin guards
are always falling.

803
00:52:59,543 --> 00:53:02,145
-Thank you very much.
-All right, thanks, guys.

804
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:03,747
-Thank you.
-All right, thanks.

805
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:06,082
Thank you.

806
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,985
Dude, I kinda want one
of those pink arm bands, though.

807
00:53:09,052 --> 00:53:10,754
-For what?
-For the captains,

808
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:12,656
that'd be dope.

809
00:53:12,722 --> 00:53:13,890
(dinging)

810
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:16,193
(birds chirping)

811
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:22,098
(indistinct remarks)

812
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,266
Okay, guys.

813
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:25,669
-High school.
-Okay, hey, so,

814
00:53:25,735 --> 00:53:27,437
will you listen up,
will you listen up?

815
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:28,238
Okay, how's it feel,
how's it feel for tomorrow?

816
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:31,107
-Good.
-Yeah?

817
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,109
This has been
a challenging season,

818
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,178
but I know at the end, guys,
we're gonna look back,

819
00:53:35,245 --> 00:53:38,848
and it's gonna be one
that we're never gonna forget.

820
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:40,850
You guys gotta bring it.

821
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:43,019
Tomorrow night,
it's your night.

822
00:53:43,086 --> 00:53:45,222
-"Eagles" on one, one, Eagles!
-One, Eagles!

823
00:53:49,926 --> 00:53:51,695
Chest, everything
down to the ground.

824
00:53:56,266 --> 00:53:58,602
(indistinct remarks)

825
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:04,808
Look at that, ooh.

826
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:07,477
(indistinct remarks)

827
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,315
You got middle, you got middle,
you got middle.

828
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:14,084
(overlapping remarks)

829
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:16,486
-Yes!
-Yeah, ball to Jack!

830
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:21,057
(indistinct remarks)

831
00:54:25,462 --> 00:54:27,897
Bro, that's not that way now.

832
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:49,452
Good shit today.

833
00:55:07,837 --> 00:55:09,873
-Oh, thanks.
-Yeah.

834
00:55:11,675 --> 00:55:13,376
Thanks, boss.

835
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:16,146
(indistinct remarks)

836
00:55:16,212 --> 00:55:18,148
Have a good one, all right?

837
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:26,456
(geese squawking)

838
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:35,398
(clanking)

839
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:37,133
(cheering)

840
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:41,304
And here come the Eagles!

841
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:47,344
(cheering)

842
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:48,511
Do you guys realize
how excited the crowd gets

843
00:55:48,578 --> 00:55:52,148
when we're passing to each other
and moving like that?

844
00:55:52,215 --> 00:55:53,650
Let's make 'em happy,
guys, come on.

845
00:55:53,717 --> 00:55:55,418
-"Eagles" on one, one, Eagles!
-One, Eagles!

846
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:56,353
(cheering)

847
00:55:56,419 --> 00:55:59,022
Dalles dominated
four of their last five

848
00:55:59,089 --> 00:56:00,990
to earn their spot
in tonight's final.

849
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:02,759
Eagles bounced back
after a series of ties

850
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:04,361
to hold onto first place.

851
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:06,830
Last year
that's as far as they got.

852
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:09,032
The Dalles came in
and beat 'em on penalty kicks.

853
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:11,067
(cheering)

854
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:13,703
This is Columbia Gorge soccer.

855
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:14,404
(clapping)

856
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:17,207
Here we go, Eagles!

857
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:18,575
Team captain Erik Siekkinen
chasing down,

858
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:21,010
right through
a Riverhawk defender,

859
00:56:21,077 --> 00:56:22,545
and Jack McAfferty
comes away with it.

860
00:56:22,612 --> 00:56:24,681
-Let's go, Eagles!
-Whole team's keeping

861
00:56:24,748 --> 00:56:25,548
a very aggressive pace early on.

862
00:56:25,615 --> 00:56:28,251
Mingo, stay back.

863
00:56:29,786 --> 00:56:31,354
-What?
-Move the ball!

864
00:56:31,421 --> 00:56:32,789
(overlapping exclamations)

865
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:33,523
No, no!

866
00:56:36,192 --> 00:56:38,228
The shot blocked, Robbie Running
with the follow-up,

867
00:56:38,294 --> 00:56:39,863
and he's in for a goal!

868
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:41,631
(whistle blowing)

869
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:42,565
(cheering)

870
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:48,037
Robbie Running strikes
first blood for the Eagles

871
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:49,973
on a beautiful rebound.

872
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,542
Eagles ahead one-nothing
in the division championship.

873
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:54,077
Way to move the ball away!

874
00:56:54,144 --> 00:56:55,412
(whistle blowing)

875
00:56:55,478 --> 00:57:00,216
Hey, don't let down,
don't let down!

876
00:57:00,283 --> 00:57:01,451
Look outside, look outside!

877
00:57:01,551 --> 00:57:03,486
Loose ball, Riverhawks recover,
a chip off and over

878
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:06,089
edging towards the Eagles' goal.

879
00:57:06,156 --> 00:57:07,590
The Eagles saves it,
gets a piece of it.

880
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:08,825
Riverhawks reinforcements
come up the middle

881
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:10,260
and he's in for a goal!

882
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:12,595
(groaning)

883
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:16,299
We're tied: 1-1.

884
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,403
Final seconds
of an intense first half.

885
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:22,639
Yo, you're all right.

886
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:24,274
I don't care
if you're a bench player,

887
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:26,242
if you never get into the game.

888
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:29,412
Every single person
on this team here is important.

889
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:29,946
We're a second-half team.

890
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:32,115
Do not forget that.

891
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:34,083
-"Eagles" on one, one, Eagles!
-One, Eagles!

892
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:35,752
Domingo!

893
00:57:37,654 --> 00:57:39,422
Well, that starts
the second half.

894
00:57:39,489 --> 00:57:41,257
(cheering)

895
00:57:41,324 --> 00:57:42,926
-No!
-Ball's stripped.

896
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:44,761
Riverhawks reverse course
and knock the ball

897
00:57:44,828 --> 00:57:46,262
right back towards
the Eagle goal.

898
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:47,797
We get it back, we get it back!

899
00:57:47,864 --> 00:57:50,099
(indistinct exclamations)

900
00:57:54,003 --> 00:57:55,605
(whistle blowing)

901
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:56,940
Stop.

902
00:57:57,006 --> 00:57:58,274
Mingo, Mingo.

903
00:57:58,341 --> 00:57:59,876
Rotate over, Wesley.

904
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:02,278
Eagles' substitution now,
Domingo Barragan,

905
00:58:02,345 --> 00:58:04,614
number 99,
in for Jack McAfferty.

906
00:58:04,681 --> 00:58:07,484
(indistinct) in the center,
Riverhawks come away with it,

907
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:09,152
carrying the ball
back into Eagle territory,

908
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:10,854
sneaking and diving for it,
but can't seem

909
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:12,622
to get a hold of it.

910
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:15,291
Keep playing, keep playing!

911
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:17,293
Domingo Barragan
with fresh legs,

912
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,561
scrambling to chase it down.

913
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:22,298
It's gotta be quicker!

914
00:58:22,365 --> 00:58:22,899
After a first half
of essentially

915
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:24,734
canceling each other out,

916
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:27,804
it all comes down to
who wants it more.

917
00:58:27,871 --> 00:58:31,474
Let's go, that's it,
Eagles, let's go.

918
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:32,642
Let's win it back, win it back.

919
00:58:32,709 --> 00:58:35,311
Domingo.

920
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:36,579
Riverhawks back out
to mid center.

921
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:37,680
Diego Sanchez is there,
gains possession

922
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:40,650
and brings it over
to Robbie Running.

923
00:58:40,717 --> 00:58:42,685
Get in there,
head this goal!

924
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:45,722
35 yards out, Barragan fakes
to his right and goes left.

925
00:58:45,822 --> 00:58:47,657
(thudding)

926
00:58:47,724 --> 00:58:49,492
Goal!

927
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:51,861
(cheering)

928
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:54,664
Barragan, Barragan!

929
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:55,565
I don't believe it!

930
00:58:55,665 --> 00:58:59,335
Goal, goal!

931
00:58:59,402 --> 00:59:01,771
From way out, Barragan
gives Hood River the lead!

932
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:10,780
(indistinct remarks)

933
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,117
Now, can they hang on?

934
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:15,084
Get it, get it!

935
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:17,854
Both teams scramble
for control of position.

936
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:20,690
This way, this way, come on!

937
00:59:20,757 --> 00:59:21,691
-No.
-Riverhawks pushing the ball

938
00:59:21,758 --> 00:59:25,128
down the field.

939
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:26,729
Diego.

940
00:59:26,796 --> 00:59:27,697
No!

941
00:59:27,764 --> 00:59:31,134
Yes, Diego.

942
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:32,635
The Eagles anxiously
try to preserve

943
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:35,705
this one-goal lead
with the clock ticking down.

944
00:59:35,772 --> 00:59:38,474
Final 45 seconds of what's been
a hard-fought battle

945
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:40,376
from minute one.

946
00:59:40,443 --> 00:59:42,145
(indistinct remarks)

947
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,380
Both teams fighting it out
for each and every ball.

948
00:59:45,782 --> 00:59:49,218
A sense of inevitability
falling over the crowd.

949
00:59:51,654 --> 00:59:55,158
They can sense their Eagles have
done enough for long enough.

950
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:56,726
And that's it,
they have done it!

951
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:01,764
The Eagles have
clinched the division

952
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:04,400
and they're headed
to the state playoffs.

953
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:06,736
(cheering)

954
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:16,846
-"Eagles" on one, one, Eagles!
-One, Eagles!

955
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:26,789
Yeah, good job.

956
01:00:30,326 --> 01:00:31,861
(flashing)

957
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:48,811
(indistinct remarks)

958
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:50,813
(rattling)

959
01:00:54,684 --> 01:00:55,885
-You wanna go pay inside?
-Yeah, I do.

960
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:58,821
(whirring)

961
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,960
Everything's changing, you know.

962
01:01:06,195 --> 01:01:08,998
During the weekend,
I'll work at the gas station

963
01:01:15,705 --> 01:01:16,839
(coughing)

964
01:01:16,906 --> 01:01:21,244
Help my mom paying bills
and all that stuff.

965
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:22,845
(rustling)

966
01:01:28,718 --> 01:01:30,253
(creaking)

967
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:32,855
(coughing)

968
01:01:35,825 --> 01:01:39,095
(indistinct remarks)

969
01:01:41,731 --> 01:01:43,533
-Ah!
-If I get a diploma,

970
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:47,036
I can go to trade school,
a community college.

971
01:01:47,103 --> 01:01:48,671
(thudding)

972
01:01:50,907 --> 01:01:54,510
(whirring)

973
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,619
(typing)

974
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,689
I'm taking a class
before school starts.

975
01:02:06,756 --> 01:02:08,124
(unintelligible)

976
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:10,126
I'm taking another class
after school.

977
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:12,195
...to complete your portfolio.

978
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:15,131
(typing)

979
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:17,633
I'm working hard to graduate.

980
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:37,386
(whirring)

981
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:43,926
(creaking)

982
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:51,334
(indistinct remarks)

983
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:56,005
(laughing)

984
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:58,407
(unintelligible)

985
01:02:58,474 --> 01:02:58,908
Thank you, have a nice night.

986
01:03:06,315 --> 01:03:10,253
(knocking)

987
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:12,955
-Mingo, what's up, man?
-Dude, what're you doing here?

988
01:03:13,022 --> 01:03:16,092
-Come.
-Thank you.

989
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:17,927
I brought you some, uh, churros.

990
01:03:17,994 --> 01:03:20,429
-Thank you.
-You wanna sit down?

991
01:03:20,496 --> 01:03:22,865
Yeah, sure.

992
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:24,600
Hey.

993
01:03:29,338 --> 01:03:30,873
(singing in Spanish)

994
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:39,448
So, uh, I know you're,
you know--

995
01:03:39,515 --> 01:03:40,950
been, uh--with, uh--
with your dad

996
01:03:41,017 --> 01:03:43,853
being deported and everything,
and I know that's super tough,

997
01:03:43,953 --> 01:03:47,056
and I can't--dude,
I can't even imagine.

998
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:50,893
I'm not gonna try to,
like, even sympathize,

999
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:53,629
because I don't think I can.

1000
01:03:55,898 --> 01:03:57,633
Yeah.

1001
01:04:00,036 --> 01:04:01,504
(coughing)

1002
01:04:01,571 --> 01:04:03,005
-He's doing okay, though?
-Yeah.

1003
01:04:03,072 --> 01:04:05,241
Yeah?

1004
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:08,845
Break out
the churros, man.

1005
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:11,547
I am gonna.

1006
01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:13,916
These seem like French fries.

1007
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:15,484
They're like sweet French fries.

1008
01:04:15,551 --> 01:04:15,918
-That's true.
-What's that?

1009
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:19,822
Look at this.

1010
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:21,991
Do you imagine yourself
doing that?

1011
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:24,193
No way.

1012
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:26,529
I try singing along with him,
so we'll play some music

1013
01:04:26,596 --> 01:04:28,531
in his car, and I'm so bad.

1014
01:04:28,598 --> 01:04:29,232
Tom was like, "Oh, my God."

1015
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:31,767
I know I'm not very good at it.

1016
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:32,501
You're way better at English
than I am at Spanish.

1017
01:04:32,568 --> 01:04:34,003
-How's your Spanish?
-Bad.

1018
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:36,772
I'm not even gonna--
it's bad, it's bad.

1019
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:38,541
-Try it.
-No, no, no, no, no.

1020
01:04:38,608 --> 01:04:40,710
-¿Cómo es tu español?
-I--like, I can understand it,

1021
01:04:40,776 --> 01:04:43,546
but I don't know how to,
like, respond very well.

1022
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:46,515
-Mal, muy mal.
-Muy mal.

1023
01:04:46,582 --> 01:04:48,184
That's my issue.

1024
01:04:48,251 --> 01:04:49,919
I'm in AP Spanish, man,
and it's killing me.

1025
01:04:50,019 --> 01:04:53,122
It's killing me.

1026
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:54,957
Let's get a churro.

1027
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:56,525
Thanks, man.

1028
01:05:03,633 --> 01:05:05,701
Are you going to college, dude?

1029
01:05:05,768 --> 01:05:07,703
-Where?
-I'm trying, uh.

1030
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:10,373
Well, this last week
I was in Colorado.

1031
01:05:10,439 --> 01:05:12,975
-Colorado?
-Yeah.

1032
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:15,077
If you could work anywhere,
where would it be?

1033
01:05:15,144 --> 01:05:18,381
Um, I have no idea, bro.

1034
01:05:18,447 --> 01:05:21,584
-I don't know yet, uh.
-You don't have a dream job?

1035
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:25,922
-Be one of them.
-One of them?

1036
01:05:25,988 --> 01:05:27,089
Yeah?

1037
01:05:27,156 --> 01:05:29,926
Start--well,
you can start a one-man band.

1038
01:05:29,992 --> 01:05:32,728
Um, I don't know yet.

1039
01:05:32,795 --> 01:05:34,263
Let me graduate first.

1040
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:34,931
(chuckling)

1041
01:05:41,671 --> 01:05:44,073
(whooshing)

1042
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:45,107
(wings flapping)

1043
01:05:45,174 --> 01:05:48,511
(whirring)

1044
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:02,425
Before we head out to the field,

1045
01:06:02,491 --> 01:06:03,926
I gotta tell you guys
I'm super proud

1046
01:06:03,993 --> 01:06:05,127
of each and every
single one of you.

1047
01:06:05,194 --> 01:06:07,596
You guys have
rallied around each other,

1048
01:06:07,663 --> 01:06:09,598
despite everything
that's been going on,

1049
01:06:09,665 --> 01:06:12,601
and I think that tonight,
more than any other night

1050
01:06:12,668 --> 01:06:15,271
in your guys' career,
you guys have the chance

1051
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:19,108
to write what you want
this story to look like.

1052
01:06:19,175 --> 01:06:20,109
And I wanna tell you guys this
from the heart

1053
01:06:20,176 --> 01:06:22,878
that I love
every single one of you.

1054
01:06:24,213 --> 01:06:27,149
Whether you believe it or not,

1055
01:06:27,216 --> 01:06:29,151
I can't wait
to watch you guys play tonight.

1056
01:06:32,188 --> 01:06:34,623
That's something
I've been realizing all season.

1057
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:38,327
I came in trying to, like,
have things a specific way,

1058
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:41,797
and that was
my individual desire, right?

1059
01:06:41,864 --> 01:06:43,232
It took a while,
but I finally realized:

1060
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:45,701
It's bigger than me,
it's bigger than Saul.

1061
01:06:45,801 --> 01:06:47,203
It's bigger than you,
or you, or you, or any of us.

1062
01:06:47,303 --> 01:06:49,805
Doesn't get
any bigger than this.

1063
01:06:49,872 --> 01:06:51,073
-Let's get out there, guys.
-Let's go!

1064
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:52,808
Let's give it
everything we got, okay?

1065
01:06:52,875 --> 01:06:54,243
This is the final right now,
let's go.

1066
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:55,011
-"Eagles" on one, one, Eagles!
-One, Eagles!

1067
01:06:55,077 --> 01:06:58,814
(cheering)

1068
01:06:58,881 --> 01:07:00,082
It's been
an unforgettable season

1069
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:01,817
for the home team,
Hood River Valley.

1070
01:07:01,884 --> 01:07:03,185
-Whose house?
-Our house!

1071
01:07:03,252 --> 01:07:06,055
-Whose house?
-Our house!

1072
01:07:06,155 --> 01:07:07,823
-Whose house?
-Our house!

1073
01:07:07,890 --> 01:07:10,359
-"Eagles" on one, one, Eagles!
-One, Eagles!

1074
01:07:10,426 --> 01:07:12,194
A victory tonight
prevails the winning team

1075
01:07:12,261 --> 01:07:13,162
to the state semi-finals,

1076
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:15,831
whereas a loss signals
the end of a season

1077
01:07:15,898 --> 01:07:17,099
as well as
the high-school careers

1078
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:19,702
of their respective seniors.

1079
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:21,270
(whistle blowing)

1080
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:24,607
Saul Chavarria with quick kick
over to Robbie Running.

1081
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:25,408
(cheering)

1082
01:07:25,508 --> 01:07:28,044
Takes a long shot,
but it's high.

1083
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:29,945
(exclaiming)

1084
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:32,048
Woodburn now making their way
down the field.

1085
01:07:32,114 --> 01:07:34,183
Long left footer,
right in the chest of Rodriguez.

1086
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:37,353
(cheering)

1087
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:39,455
40 minutes in the books
and no score here.

1088
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:41,123
Eagles, Bulldogs.

1089
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:44,193
We've had multiple,
like, just above the goal.

1090
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:46,695
We've had three kicks
from just outside the box.

1091
01:07:46,762 --> 01:07:48,130
It's gonna happen,
it's gonna work for us.

1092
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:50,232
We gotta believe it, man.

1093
01:07:52,768 --> 01:07:54,103
Eagles have a three on three.

1094
01:07:54,203 --> 01:07:55,704
Call it, time!

1095
01:07:55,771 --> 01:07:57,239
-Okay!
-Got a ball at midfield.

1096
01:07:57,306 --> 01:08:00,076
-About to call it.
-Eagles' Sanchez is there

1097
01:08:00,142 --> 01:08:02,445
looking downtown again
with the long pass.

1098
01:08:02,545 --> 01:08:05,047
(cheering)

1099
01:08:05,114 --> 01:08:07,883
Makes his shot, and oh,
he's gonna be just wide.

1100
01:08:10,419 --> 01:08:12,721
Whole team's ratcheting up
for defense

1101
01:08:12,788 --> 01:08:14,090
to prevent a last-minute goal.

1102
01:08:14,156 --> 01:08:16,091
Woodburn in particular
taking no chances,

1103
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:18,727
as they've done all game.

1104
01:08:18,794 --> 01:08:20,329
(indistinct remarks)

1105
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:21,430
Domingo Barragan gains control
with his quick pass

1106
01:08:21,497 --> 01:08:25,501
over to Wesley Carter,
who has control momentarily.

1107
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:27,169
15 on the clock.

1108
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:31,273
Diego Sanchez is back in again

1109
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:33,342
for Domingo Barragan.

1110
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:34,343
(indistinct exclamations)

1111
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:39,115
(cheering)

1112
01:08:39,181 --> 01:08:42,351
Team captain Erik Siekkinen
with the ball kicks back out,

1113
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:44,920
but it's picked up
by Woodburn number 25.

1114
01:08:44,987 --> 01:08:47,456
Lopez with seconds remaining,
30 yards out.

1115
01:08:47,523 --> 01:08:50,359
Diving save with Rodriguez.

1116
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:52,261
That's the end of regulation.

1117
01:08:52,328 --> 01:08:54,597
The OSAA US
boy's Portland finals

1118
01:08:54,663 --> 01:08:57,766
will be decided in penalty case.

1119
01:08:57,833 --> 01:09:00,936
Not happening today, guys,
we're not doing that today.

1120
01:09:01,003 --> 01:09:02,538
Hell no.

1121
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:04,940
We worked way too fucking hard
to end right here.

1122
01:09:05,007 --> 01:09:07,143
Guys, I've had
way too much Goddamn drama

1123
01:09:07,209 --> 01:09:08,978
to end right now, okay?

1124
01:09:09,044 --> 01:09:10,045
-Let's go.
-We're going all the way, boys.

1125
01:09:10,145 --> 01:09:11,547
Let's do it.

1126
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:14,316
-"Eagles" on one, one, Eagles!
-One, Eagles!

1127
01:09:14,383 --> 01:09:15,985
Crowd's on their feet.

1128
01:09:16,051 --> 01:09:17,486
Home team's ready to go.

1129
01:09:18,454 --> 01:09:21,957
Wesley Carter up first
for the Eagles.

1130
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:25,127
The kick is good!

1131
01:09:25,194 --> 01:09:26,228
(cheering)

1132
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:28,964
Good job, there you go!

1133
01:09:29,031 --> 01:09:30,366
Eagles up 1 nothing.

1134
01:09:30,466 --> 01:09:32,334
Now it's Woodburn's chance
to match it.

1135
01:09:36,038 --> 01:09:37,806
Kick is good.

1136
01:09:37,873 --> 01:09:40,509
It's 1-1 as the Eagles'
team captain Saul Chavarria

1137
01:09:40,576 --> 01:09:42,077
gets set.

1138
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:43,812
No margin for error here.

1139
01:09:43,879 --> 01:09:47,349
Just one mistake
can cost the game.

1140
01:09:47,416 --> 01:09:49,318
But, the kick is good!

1141
01:09:49,385 --> 01:09:51,086
Saul Chavarria.

1142
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:53,489
(cheering)

1143
01:09:58,093 --> 01:10:00,429
Now it's Woodburn's chance
to match it.

1144
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:07,002
Oh, and the kick is good!

1145
01:10:07,069 --> 01:10:09,271
Rodriguez got a hand on it,
but it found its way

1146
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:10,372
into the back of the net.

1147
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:12,341
Woodburn is still in it,

1148
01:10:12,408 --> 01:10:16,879
as team captain, number 8,
Erik Siekkinen steps in,

1149
01:10:16,946 --> 01:10:18,614
attempting to
recapture the lead.

1150
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:26,388
The crowd going quiet,
the benches going quiet,

1151
01:10:26,455 --> 01:10:29,291
waiting to see
the outcome of this.

1152
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:32,027
(indistinct remarks)

1153
01:10:32,094 --> 01:10:34,396
Erik Siekkinen looking up
to the sky for inspiration.

1154
01:10:34,463 --> 01:10:37,466
And here we go.

1155
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:40,135
(groaning)

1156
01:10:45,474 --> 01:10:48,310
Woodburn now
with a chance to win it.

1157
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:52,414
The look on the faces of
the Eagles' bench says it all,

1158
01:10:52,481 --> 01:10:54,550
as they're one goal away
from the end of the game

1159
01:10:54,617 --> 01:10:57,253
and their run for
the state championship.

1160
01:10:57,319 --> 01:11:00,456
-Come on, Alex!
-Let's go, Alex!

1161
01:11:00,556 --> 01:11:02,258
(cheering)

1162
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,434
Here comes the shot.

1163
01:11:15,004 --> 01:11:17,072
And that's it.

1164
01:11:17,139 --> 01:11:19,174
Woodburn wins it
in penalty kicks.

1165
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:21,577
(cheering)

1166
01:11:29,518 --> 01:11:31,954
Season ends for the Eagles.

1167
01:11:32,021 --> 01:11:33,756
High school careers end
for the seniors,

1168
01:11:33,822 --> 01:11:35,424
but not before they delivered
on a league championship.

1169
01:11:45,501 --> 01:11:48,370
We did everything right,
and sometimes

1170
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:50,306
luck is just not on your side,
and that's how

1171
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:52,775
it's gonna be in life,
but you gotta fight through it.

1172
01:11:52,841 --> 01:11:54,777
-I'm sorry I let you guys down.
-No, that's fine.

1173
01:11:54,843 --> 01:11:57,546
We win together,
we go down together.

1174
01:11:57,646 --> 01:12:00,115
Easy as that.

1175
01:12:00,182 --> 01:12:02,184
-"Eagles" on one, one, Eagles!
-One, Eagles!

1176
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:41,824
(birds chirping)

1177
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:44,993
(whirring)

1178
01:12:48,564 --> 01:12:51,834
-Thank you, looks delicious.
-You're welcome.

1179
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:53,602
(indistinct remarks)

1180
01:12:56,739 --> 01:12:58,774
Okay, guys, so, let's put a--
let's put a closure

1181
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:00,376
to the season here.

1182
01:13:00,442 --> 01:13:03,045
I wanted to talk to you guys
about a couple things.

1183
01:13:03,112 --> 01:13:05,514
In life, guys,
we have to learn how to lose.

1184
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:09,017
Sometimes we're gonna fail,

1185
01:13:09,084 --> 01:13:11,019
and we're not
gonna land that job,

1186
01:13:11,086 --> 01:13:12,388
or guess what, I'm not gonna
get accepted to that school,

1187
01:13:12,454 --> 01:13:14,523
and I don't think
it's the end of the world.

1188
01:13:16,625 --> 01:13:19,027
Okay?

1189
01:13:19,094 --> 01:13:21,797
My job as a coach
is not just to win games.

1190
01:13:21,897 --> 01:13:23,399
It's to also help
prepare you guys

1191
01:13:23,465 --> 01:13:25,467
to be men,

1192
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:29,271
to one day be a father,

1193
01:13:29,371 --> 01:13:33,409
to one day be able to look back
on what you guys did,

1194
01:13:33,475 --> 01:13:36,278
and be proud of it.

1195
01:13:36,378 --> 01:13:38,247
Okay, we'll get through this.

1196
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:43,886
Okay, let's eat.

1197
01:13:43,952 --> 01:13:44,653
Well, I don't even
like tomatoes.

1198
01:13:44,753 --> 01:13:47,256
(chuckling)

1199
01:13:47,322 --> 01:13:49,391
(indistinct remarks)

1200
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:52,060
Hey, Robbie, you and Erik,
can you guys help me

1201
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:52,761
figure out the ball situation?

1202
01:13:52,828 --> 01:13:54,897
I don't know how to play golf.

1203
01:13:54,963 --> 01:13:56,665
-Tell us, dude.
-No, I'm sorry, you guys.

1204
01:13:56,765 --> 01:13:59,902
I don't know
how to play either.

1205
01:13:59,968 --> 01:14:01,503
It's just like--
it's kinda like baseball.

1206
01:14:03,672 --> 01:14:04,673
-Yeah, there you go.
-Look at that champ.

1207
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:07,576
Ooh!

1208
01:14:07,643 --> 01:14:10,245
Zack, you're terrible.

1209
01:14:10,312 --> 01:14:11,580
South BK.

1210
01:14:11,647 --> 01:14:14,516
Oh, and he gets it,
what a strike!

1211
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:16,251
Eagles!

1212
01:14:16,318 --> 01:14:17,586
(chuckling)

1213
01:14:17,653 --> 01:14:19,421
Can we get some
Happy Gilmore in here?

1214
01:14:19,488 --> 01:14:21,123
All right, okay.

1215
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:23,592
All right,
I really want this right now.

1216
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:32,100
(crickets chirping)

1217
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:25,521
(whooshing)

1218
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:30,692
(whirring)

1219
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:36,431
(humming)

1220
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:40,836
(cheering)

1221
01:15:40,903 --> 01:15:42,838
Yeah, buddy!

1222
01:15:42,905 --> 01:15:44,873
Erik, Auggie wants
a picture with you.

1223
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:46,341
Okay.

1224
01:15:46,408 --> 01:15:49,011
Aw, very cute, guys.

1225
01:15:49,077 --> 01:15:51,013
We made it!

1226
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:52,781
I don't know, turn on
the lights and I'll glow

1227
01:15:52,881 --> 01:15:55,551
To the extreme,
I rock a mic like a vandal

1228
01:15:55,617 --> 01:16:00,022
Light up a stage and wax
a chump like a candle, dance

1229
01:16:01,456 --> 01:16:04,192
(indistinct chanting)

1230
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:12,034
(cheering)

1231
01:16:17,472 --> 01:16:18,807
(cheering)

1232
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:24,046
By the authority vested in me,

1233
01:16:24,112 --> 01:16:26,381
I confirm that all
have completed

1234
01:16:26,448 --> 01:16:28,550
all local and state
diploma requirements,

1235
01:16:28,617 --> 01:16:31,153
and are now ready
to receive your diplomas.

1236
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:32,754
(cheering)

1237
01:16:35,791 --> 01:16:38,060
Saul Chavarria.

1238
01:16:38,126 --> 01:16:39,728
(applauding)

1239
01:16:42,731 --> 01:16:45,233
