00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,717
What do you think, I should get
a house or a condo?

363
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,968
Condo.

364
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:53,136
And then he didn't even
try the shrimp.

365
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,221
He fell asleep eating
microwave popcorn.

366
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:57,724
Are you even listening to me?

367
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:00,018
Sorry, yes. Vegas.

368
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:02,562
I'm glad things are working out
for you.

369
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,313
Isn't life an amazing adventure?

370
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:05,773
[sighs]

371
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:08,234
One day you're a lonely,
divorced beauty queen

372
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:10,111
sweeping up hair
in a salon

373
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:11,738
and the next you're flying
to Vegas

374
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:14,907
to be with the man
of your dreams.

375
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,659
I'm happy for you.

376
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,202
Thank you.

377
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:20,079
That means the world
to me.

378
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:22,999
Oh, and I can finally get off
this crappy island!

379
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:24,000
I'm sorry.

380
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:25,710
I'm- I'm... sorry.

381
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:27,378
Whidbey is, like,
perfectly nice,

382
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:30,339
it's just, you know, it's a
little quiet for a girl like me.

383
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,299
I guess.

384
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:33,634
[sighs]

385
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:37,305
God, I do love that man.

386
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:38,598
And now we're never gonna have
to say goodbye

387
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,558
to each other ever again.

388
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,228
What?

389
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:45,813
Nothing.

390
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:46,939
I thought you were happy
for me.

391
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:50,151
I am. It's just...

392
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:53,029
Russ has been all up
in my face again.

393
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:55,364
Just thinking about
another thing that he did.

394
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,867
He was doing our taxes
and he's all like

395
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:59,285
"Brenna, where are
the bank statements?

396
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:00,703
"Where are the receipts?

00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:03,873

$604 at Costco?

Oh, my god!

400
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:09,921
I'm so sick of listening
to you whine

401
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,547
about Russel this
and Russel that.

402
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,508
You can't even be happy
for me for two minutes

403
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:16,719
because you're so
busy complaining.

404
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:19,013
If you're so miserable why don't
you just grow a spine

405
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:21,390
and do something about it,
huh?

406
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:24,977
Well, it's not that simple to
just up and leave your husband.

407
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,854
Yeah, it is.
I did it.

408
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:27,939
Twice.

409
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:30,608
But we have a kid together.

410
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:32,985
I'm sorry.

411
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:36,656
I'm- I'm sorry.
Sally's great.

412
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,699
I... look, I'm just trying

413
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:41,035
to give you a little bit
of tough love.

414
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,787
Sometimes, the truth,
it's hard to take,

415
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:48,918
but when you- when you finally
face it it sets you free.

416
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:52,547
Hey, I know this is a bad time
but do you have my rent cheque?

417
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,428
Thank you.

418
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:02,181
Oh, there's my ride.

419
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:06,102
Listen, I know that
you've got this

420
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:09,897
because you are a smart woman
no matter what Russel says.

421
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:12,692
He never said I wasn't smart.
Did he say that?

422
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:14,318
You know what?

423
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:18,156
Why don't you come to Vegas
and party with me and Jim?

424
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,282
Maybe I will.

425

the sink in the laundry

Except for the salon.

the same without you.

I gotta go.

Why didn't you answer
my calls?

00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:37,222
What're you talking about?

720
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:39,558
You don't even remember?

721
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:41,977
You told me to grow a spine
and do something

722
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:44,021
so I threw Russel out.

723
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:46,023
Now I got no money,
no husband

724
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,858
and no frickin' clue
what to do next,

725
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:49,526
so why don't you advise me,

726
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:52,320
all great and powerful
Peggy Sue Thomas?

727
00:33:57,036 --> 00:33:58,452
Hi.

728
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:00,120
[clears throat]

729
00:34:00,164 --> 00:34:02,956
Isn't she the best?
She's the best.

730
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,666
I just love this woman.

731
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,502
Brenna, you know I always
have your back

732
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:09,171
so we're gonna figure
this out.

733
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:10,464
Ok?

734
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:12,507
But first you need a drink.

735
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:13,550
Yeah.

736
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:15,969
Mmmhmm.

737
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,222
Oh, my gosh!

738
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:21,767
That's so strong.

739
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:22,809
You drink these all the time?

740
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:23,810
All the time.

741
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:30,067
[sighs]
Oh... I'm attracted
to his darkness.

742
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,443
I know that probably sounds
weird to you,

743
00:34:31,487 --> 00:34:33,028
being married to Russel.

744
00:34:33,072 --> 00:34:34,821
What are you attracted to,
his blandness?

745
00:34:34,865 --> 00:34:37,032
[laughing]

746
00:34:37,076 --> 00:34:39,493
What do you mean,
"his darkness"?

747
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:41,369
Oh, he had an awful childhood.

748
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:44,706
He and his mom were abused
by his step-father.

749
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,417
He's still haunted by it.

750
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:51,463
He's a complicated guy but I
love the way his mind works.

751
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:53,507
Hmm.

752
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,133
[chuckle]

753
00:34:56,804 --> 00:34:58,220
Mama! I missed you!

754
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:00,222
Oh, I missed you.

755
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:02,307
Did you gamble away
all our money?

756
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:04,184
What did you say?

757
00:35:04,228 --> 00:35:05,227
Sally?

758
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,562
What are you telling her?

759
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:10,148
Well, hello to you, too,
Brenna.

760
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:12,067
How was Vegas?

761
00:35:12,111 --> 00:35:14,152
It was great.

762
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:15,821
Peggy and Jim sure know
how to have fun.

763
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:17,197
Not like some people.

764
00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:18,907
Look at you, galavanting
all over the continent

765
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:22,536
with your drunk buddies while
I scramble to find child care.

766
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:24,579
Maybe I should do
a little travelling.

767
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:27,582
Take Sally to Alaska
to visit my dad.

768
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:29,167
You wouldn't dare.

769
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:31,128
You know what, maybe I'll
take her there permanently.

770
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:32,170
Sally!

771
00:35:34,383 --> 00:35:35,590
It's time to go.

772
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:36,967
This is too far, Russ.

773
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,051
[mocking]
This is too far, Russ.

774
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:38,969
Say goodbye to your father!

775
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:40,053
Bye, Daddy!

776
00:35:40,097 --> 00:35:41,555
Bye, sweetheart,
I'll see you soon.

777
00:35:43,183 --> 00:35:44,808
[sighs]

778
00:35:44,852 --> 00:35:48,145
This feels sudden, so I want
to talk it over with you.

779
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:50,105
If the judge signs
your restraining order

780
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:52,482
Russel won't be able
to contact you

781
00:35:52,526 --> 00:35:54,901
or come within 100 yards
of you.

782
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:56,987
Are you certain you want
to proceed?

783
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,864
Absolutely.

784
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:00,657
Alright.

785
00:36:00,701 --> 00:36:02,409
I'll need you to describe
the incidents

786
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:04,452
that have prompted you
to file.

787
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:08,999
He said he was gonna take Sally
to Alaska and not come back.

788
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:11,209
Plus, he yells at me.

789
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:13,587
-Verbal abuse?
-Big time.

790
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:16,047
And he yells at our daughter.

791
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:18,550
He neglects her, too.

792
00:36:18,594 --> 00:36:21,344
He's a very neglectful father.

793
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:24,181
Has there been physical abuse?

794
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:26,766
Not so much.

795
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:30,770
But he says he's gonna get me
when I'm not looking.

796
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:32,147
Get you?

797
00:36:32,191 --> 00:36:33,982
He said he's gonna punch me
in the face

798
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:36,443
and hold me under the tub water
'til my feet stop kicking.

799
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,740
I sleep with a knife
under my pillow.

800
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:43,742
I don't trust him.

801
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:55,712
[sighs]

802
00:36:55,756 --> 00:36:57,714
I cannot believe that bartender
from the other night.

803
00:36:57,758 --> 00:36:59,633
I mean, the nerve of that guy.

804
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:01,051
We spend so much money
in that place

805
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:03,178
you think they'd be begging us
to show up.

806
00:37:03,222 --> 00:37:07,557
I do think we class up that dump
a little bit, don't you?

807
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:09,476
We need money, Peggy.

808
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:16,358
I thought you were a
self-made millionaire.

809
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:18,568
And I thought you were gonna
sell your house to Brenna.

810
00:37:18,612 --> 00:37:20,862
Brenna's broke,
you know that.

811
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:23,907
So what's this really about,
Jim?

812
00:37:23,951 --> 00:37:26,326
The Microsoft sale
was years ago.

813
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:28,912
That money's pretty much gone.

814
00:37:28,956 --> 00:37:31,957
And what about that fancy new
software you're working on?

815
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,750
I haven't been developing
the software,

816
00:37:33,794 --> 00:37:35,043
I've been partying with you!

817
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:37,045
Is that really so awful?!

818
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:39,089
No.

819
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:41,633
It's been great.

820
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:43,718
But I gotta go home.

821
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:45,679
You mean Florida.

822
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,681
I've gotta work.

823
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:49,474
We've been spending money
like crazy.

824
00:37:49,518 --> 00:37:51,059
My credit cards are maxed out

825
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:52,644
and my savings account
is nearly empty.

826
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:56,189
You do realize that you could-
you could work here, right?

827
00:37:56,233 --> 00:38:00,986
So why do you really wanna
go back to Florida?

828
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:02,612
She is my wife, Peggy.

829
00:38:02,656 --> 00:38:03,655
Oh, finally.

830
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:05,991
Finally, the truth!

831
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:08,451
Plus, all my business
connections are in Florida.

832
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:10,203
And my software company.

833
00:38:10,247 --> 00:38:11,496
My bank accounts.

834
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,998
And your precious wife, Jean.

835
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:15,000
Am I not enough for you, Jim?

836
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:17,210
You are more than enough for me.

837
00:38:17,254 --> 00:38:20,171
But neither of us can afford
this lifestyle!

838
00:38:27,306 --> 00:38:29,306
[exhales]

839
00:38:31,393 --> 00:38:34,185
If you go back...

840
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:36,855
I will come down there

841
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:43,236
and I will bang and bang on
your door, wife or no wife.

842
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,989
[phone rings]

843
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:48,825
[sighs]

844
00:38:50,162 --> 00:38:51,161
What is it, Brenna?

845
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:52,579
Guess what?

846
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:54,831
I took a restraining order
out on Russel.

847
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:56,583
And here I was thinking you were
calling to apologize

848
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:59,044
for the late rent, again.

849
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:01,629
Oh yeah.
Sorry about that.

850
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:03,923
Anyways, you wanna know
what pushed me over the edge?

851
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:06,718
When I came back from Vegas
he threatened me and Sally.

852
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:08,553
He was so abusive.

853
00:39:08,597 --> 00:39:10,847
Now he can't come anywhere
near us.

854
00:39:10,891 --> 00:39:13,850
And I say good riddance.
He's such an idiot.

855
00:39:13,894 --> 00:39:16,519
Wasting money on skateboards
he can't ride,

856
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:18,229
guitars he can't play.

857
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:20,231
Life insurance he can't cash in.

858
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:21,441
Life insurance?

859
00:39:23,612 --> 00:39:26,196
Yeah, he's got like
three policies now.

860
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:29,240
Anyway, babe, I gotta go.
Sally will be home soon.

861
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:31,242
I'll call you later.

862
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:37,457
And these are the lights.

863
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:39,542
[character voice]
I like the lights.

864
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:41,127
And that's my mommy.

865
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:43,880
Just eat your cauliflower
and then you can go play.

866
00:39:43,924 --> 00:39:45,840
But it's gross.

867
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,467
It's good for you.

868
00:39:47,511 --> 00:39:50,845
[character voice]
It smells like a diaper.

869
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,764
Just eat your food or
I'm telling your father.

870
00:39:52,808 --> 00:39:54,099
You're gonna call Daddy?

871
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:55,517
Can I talk to him, too?

872
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,851
No.

873
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:59,979
But... I miss him.

874
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:02,816
I miss him, too, honey.

875
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:04,150
Then why won't you let me
see him?

876
00:40:04,194 --> 00:40:07,237
Because it's- it just- it-
it's grown up stuff.

877
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,905
Just go to your room.

878
00:40:08,949 --> 00:40:09,906
But...

879
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,574
Just go on!
Go to your room!

880
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:13,451
I hate you!

881
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:26,339
What have I done?

882
00:40:34,516 --> 00:40:36,933
[phone ringing]

883
00:40:36,977 --> 00:40:38,935
Detective Williams.

884
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:43,815
This is Brenna Douglas.

885
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:44,941
Mrs. Douglas.

886
00:40:44,985 --> 00:40:46,734
How can I help you?

887
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:49,112
I wanna cancel the restraining
order.

888
00:40:50,157 --> 00:40:51,573
Daddy!

889
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:52,907
Hey, honey.

890
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:54,617
I made a superhero cape
for my bunny.

891
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:57,287
Oh, that's awesome.
Can I see?

892
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:59,122
You did this all by yourself?

893
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:01,458
Wow, cool.

894
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:03,460
Hey, sweetie, um, Mom and I
need to talk.

895
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:04,627
So I should go play?

896
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:05,712
You got it.

897
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:07,547
Got it.

898
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:08,006
See ya, kiddo.

00:41:12,846 --> 00:41:17,098
So, the restraining order.

900
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:19,225
So sorry about that.

901
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:21,311
What made you change your mind?

902
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:23,855
I was overreacting.

903
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:27,108
You didn't do anything
to justify that.

904
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:29,194
Well, I'm sorry
for the things I said.

905
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:32,697
I'd never take Sally
away from you.

906
00:41:32,741 --> 00:41:35,825
You're a good mom, Brenna.

907
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:37,660
You're a good father.

908
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:41,456
We're just not a good couple.

909
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:45,460
We used to be, remember?

910
00:41:45,504 --> 00:41:48,588
I remember being crazy
about you.

911
00:41:48,632 --> 00:41:50,757
Same here.

912
00:41:52,761 --> 00:41:55,261
Hey, can we try again?

913
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:56,888
Please?

914
00:41:58,558 --> 00:42:01,601
Sally, it's time for me to go.

915
00:42:01,645 --> 00:42:03,269
Bye, Mama!

916
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:05,897
I guess that's a "no".

917
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:12,612
Give me time.

918
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:21,162
These late fees,
they're- they're obscene.

919
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:22,747
I mean, how do you expect anyone
to off their bill

920
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:24,249
when you keep charging-

921
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:25,792
Collector: They're the
conditions you agreed to.

922
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:28,586
Unfortunately, there are
consequences for defaulting-

923
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:30,255
No, I understand
the consequences

924
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:32,423
of not paying on time,
I mean, I'm not an-

925
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:34,592
But your inability to make
the minimum monthly payment

926
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:36,469
we have to cancel your card.

927
00:42:36,513 --> 00:42:38,388
No, no. You can't cancel
my card!

928
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:39,430
What am I gonna live on?

929
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:40,682

931
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:50,275
Hey, rockstar.
How was the audition?

932
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:52,694
They're a shit band, anyway.

933
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:58,825
Fran- Fran.

934
00:42:58,868 --> 00:42:59,742
Russel, explain this to me, why?

935
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:01,160
It's over, ok?

936
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:02,287
Can you just tell me why?

937
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:04,080
I love Brenna.

938
00:43:04,124 --> 00:43:06,124
And I'm gonna do whatever
it takes to win her back.

939
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:07,292
No. Please don't do this.

940
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:08,209
Goodbye.

941
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:09,836
Russel! Russ-

942
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,007
Do you believe me now?

943
00:43:15,135 --> 00:43:16,342
Yeah.

944
00:43:17,137 --> 00:43:18,428
Yeah?

945
00:43:18,722 --> 00:43:19,554
Yeah?

947
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:22,515

Ok. Ok.

953
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:31,774
This isn't very patient.

Yeah, well, I'm sorry but
I've got bills to pay, too, Jim.

956
00:43:38,992 --> 00:43:40,992
It's just until I get paid.

957
00:43:41,036 --> 00:43:42,410
Paid?

958
00:43:42,454 --> 00:43:44,245
I thought you couldn't find
any gigs.

959
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:46,414
I'm sure I'll get
something soon.

960
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:48,791
I hope so.

961
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:51,294
I can't send you any more money
'cause I don't have any.

962
00:43:51,338 --> 00:43:53,254
Can you borrow some?

963
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:54,714
I'll try.

964
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:56,966
You know, I do miss you, Jim.

965
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:01,512
I gotta go. Bye.

966
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:12,857
I can't believe I haven't gotten
any offers on the house.

967
00:44:12,901 --> 00:44:15,068
I really hope Brenna can buy it.

968
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:16,778
Brenna's broke.

969
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:18,696
Yeah, because Russel spends
all his money

970
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:21,616
on sex toys and life insurance.

971
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:28,456
You know, maybe we should
take a trip home for Christmas.

something wrong?

No, not at all.

976
00:44:38,093 --> 00:44:41,094
I was just thinking...

977
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:44,222
maybe you could spend Christmas
with us.

978
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:46,057

Peggy. Hi.

983
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:57,777
I have a gift for Brenna.

984
00:44:57,821 --> 00:44:59,904
Alright, great.
You have a present for Brenna?

985
00:44:59,948 --> 00:45:01,197
That's what I said.

986
00:45:01,241 --> 00:45:02,615
And Russel, listen,

987
00:45:02,659 --> 00:45:03,866
we weren't supposed to get
each other presents

988
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:04,826
so it's a surprise.

989
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:06,285
You can't tell her, ok?

990
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:07,995
My lips are sealed,
I promise.

991
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:10,540
Alright, thank you.
I'm gonna hand you to Jim.

992
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:11,999
Ok.

993
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:14,043
Oh, look, there's Brenna.
I'm gonna go say hi.

joining us for the holidays.

Oh, that's nice.
For Russel, at least.

Mrs. Douglas, this is my
partner, Detective Steadman.

1089
00:50:19,434 --> 00:50:20,808
Hello, ma'am.

1090
00:50:20,852 --> 00:50:22,184
I wondered if we could ask you
a few questions

1091
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:23,477
about your husband.

1092
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:26,230
Is this about the restraining
order?

1093
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:40,453
Things have been bad between us
for years

1094
00:50:40,496 --> 00:50:43,456
but we've been trying
to make our marriage work.

1095
00:50:43,499 --> 00:50:45,332
I hope we can.

1096
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:48,461
How long have the two of you
been separated?

1097
00:50:49,589 --> 00:50:51,422
A couple of months.

1098
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,925
And the reason
for your separation?

1099
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:57,219
Well, she knows.

1100
00:50:57,263 --> 00:51:02,850
Um, we fought constantly
and he was cheating on me.

1101
00:51:02,894 --> 00:51:04,810
With whom?

1102
00:51:05,438 --> 00:51:06,771
Multiple women.

1103
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:08,397
And men.

1104
00:51:08,441 --> 00:51:11,067
One man.

1105
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:14,278
At least, I suspect.

1106
00:51:14,322 --> 00:51:15,863
And a variety of women.

1107
00:51:15,907 --> 00:51:19,075
Or- or one. One woman
for sure.

1108
00:51:19,118 --> 00:51:20,743
An older woman.

1109
00:51:20,787 --> 00:51:23,788
He liked to brag about having
sex and partying with her.

1110
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:27,083
He was into some kinky stuff.

1111
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:31,378
I- I just can't accept
his deviant lifestyle.

1112
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:33,839
And by "deviant lifestyle"
you mean...

1113
00:51:33,883 --> 00:51:38,803
He wants me to swing with him
and he gets mad when I say no.

1114
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:41,847
I think he wants
to join a key club.

1115
00:51:41,891 --> 00:51:46,143
I hear they meet Saturdays at a-
at a restaurant on the island.

Brenna, we um-

And he dresses like a freak.

1118
00:51:49,065 --> 00:51:51,607
He wore a kilt to work.

1119
00:51:51,651 --> 00:51:54,276
And he thinks everything he sees
on the internet is normal.

1120
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,529
And he's very controlling.

1121
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:58,114
And very abusive.

1122
00:51:58,157 --> 00:52:00,199
Physically abusive?

1123
00:52:00,243 --> 00:52:02,993
Well, not- not so much.
Just mentally.

00:52:07,125 --> 00:52:09,166
Brenna, do you know why
we're here?

00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:12,128
Not really.

1126
00:52:16,843 --> 00:52:20,719
Your husband, Russel, was found
dead in his car this afternoon.

Oh.

1128
00:52:27,812 --> 00:52:29,979

She didn't seem too surprised.

1133
00:52:43,411 --> 00:52:46,162
Didn't seem too broken up
about it, either.

00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:49,915

and Russel

Well, at least they were trying.

I wish my ex and I had tried
harder to save our marriage.

1153
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:26,387
Poor Brenna.
She must be a mess.

1154
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:29,056
You know the Whidbey gossips
are all over this.

1155
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,683
People are saying
she's a suspect.

1156
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:32,184
Hmm.

Russel Douglas had no enemies.

Well, not everyone.

The next she's cancelling
the restraining order.

00:55:05,011 --> 00:55:08,095
Your husband died December 26.

1168
00:55:08,139 --> 00:55:10,639
You filed an insurance claim

you are a person of interest

in your husband's murder.

1181
00:55:37,752 --> 00:55:41,128
Why would I wanna kill
my own husband?

1182
00:55:41,172 --> 00:55:45,341
Well, some may say the insurance
money could be a motive.

1183
00:55:45,384 --> 00:55:47,217
Would you agree to take
a polygraph test?

1184
00:55:47,303 --> 00:55:48,052
Nope.

1185
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:49,887
Nope?

1186
00:55:50,473 --> 00:55:52,765
My lawyer advised against it.

1187
00:55:53,601 --> 00:55:55,351
I'll be frank.

1188
00:55:55,394 --> 00:55:57,936
The company is reluctant
to issue the money to you.

1189
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:59,521
We'd be willing, however,

1190
00:55:59,565 --> 00:56:01,273
to set up a trust fund
for your daughter.

1191
00:56:01,317 --> 00:56:04,109
My lawyer said you might
pull something like this

1192
00:56:04,153 --> 00:56:07,488

in the death of my husband

1197

The insurance proceeds
are rightfully mine

1198
00:56:18,376 --> 00:56:21,001
and it is inappropriate
to withhold the money

1199
00:56:21,045 --> 00:56:25,381
or award it to my child based
on unsupported allegations.

I'm scared to talk about it.

Yes, this is Peggy.

because your name came up

unwilling landlord for Brenna.

my house, but...

Were you in touch with Russel
during the holidays?

00:59:04,333 --> 00:59:06,833

Oh, I don't think so,

I just got off with
Peggy Sue Thomas.

She called Russel a couple days
before Christmas.

Doesn't seem to be
anything there.

1254

Alright.

01:00:00,681 --> 01:00:01,805
Ok.

1256
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:06,560
[ringing]

1257
01:00:06,604 --> 01:00:08,353
This is Jim,
leave a message.

1258
01:00:08,397 --> 01:00:10,230
[beep]

1259
01:00:10,274 --> 01:00:12,274
[teary] Stop being a wuss
and call me back.

1260
01:00:12,318 --> 01:00:14,067
We need to talk.

1261
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:53,231
[ringing]

1262
01:00:53,275 --> 01:00:55,359
Peggy. I've been calling
and calling.

1263
01:00:55,402 --> 01:00:57,486
Why haven't you called me back?

1264
01:00:58,906 --> 01:01:04,701
I know, I'm sorry,
it's just uh...

1265
01:01:04,745 --> 01:01:08,789
ever since I heard about Russel
I uh, I've just been so upset.

1266
01:01:08,832 --> 01:01:12,918
Well, I've been upset too.
I- I needed you, Peggy.

1267
01:01:12,961 --> 01:01:15,003
I just didn't know
what to say.

1268
01:01:15,047 --> 01:01:17,464
It's just so awful.

1269
01:01:17,508 --> 01:01:20,425
And poor Sally,
growing up without a father?

1270
01:01:20,469 --> 01:01:23,303
Now all she has is me
and you know I'm a mess.

1271
01:01:23,347 --> 01:01:24,596
Yeah, well...

1272
01:01:26,892 --> 01:01:31,144
You know, Brenna,

1273
01:01:31,188 --> 01:01:35,565
you're gonna be stronger and
you're gonna get through this.

1274
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:37,442
I just know it.

1275
01:01:37,528 --> 01:01:38,652
Ok.

1276
01:01:38,696 --> 01:01:40,946
Yeah. Thanks.

1277
01:01:40,989 --> 01:01:44,950
Hey, um, the police
just called me.

1278
01:01:44,993 --> 01:01:48,453
Did they- did they ask you
about me or something?

1279
01:01:48,497 --> 01:01:50,580
No, they probably got
your number

1280
01:01:50,624 --> 01:01:52,541
from Russel's phone records.

1281
01:01:54,712 --> 01:01:57,629
Of course. That makes
so much sense.

1282
01:01:57,673 --> 01:02:00,966
Yeah. Um, I have some news.

1283
01:02:01,009 --> 01:02:02,801
I had to fight tooth and nail
for it

1284
01:02:02,845 --> 01:02:04,720
but I finally got
the insurance money.

1285
01:02:04,763 --> 01:02:06,972
One policy, at least.

1286
01:02:07,015 --> 01:02:09,766
Oh my god,
that's great!

1287
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:11,977
You can buy my house.

1288
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:16,481
Yeah, um... actually,
I'm- I'm really sorry Peggy,

1289
01:02:16,525 --> 01:02:18,734
but I couldn't stay there.

1290
01:02:18,777 --> 01:02:20,861
There are too many memories.

1291
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:25,907
I saw a house for sale and I
fell in love and I bought it.

1292
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:28,577
This place, just-
it feels better.

1293
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:31,246
It's a new start for us.

1294
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:33,874
I- I hope you understand.

1295
01:02:36,336 --> 01:02:39,212
Peggy, are you there?

1296
01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:41,047
Yeah, I'm here.

1297
01:02:44,011 --> 01:02:46,636
Congratulations, I guess.

1298
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:49,890
I hope you're not upset.

1299
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:51,516
Brenna, I- I gotta run.

1300
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:53,351
Can we talk about this
some other time?

1301
01:02:53,395 --> 01:02:56,313
I'm uh- I gotta go, ok?

1302
01:02:58,859 --> 01:03:00,484
God!!!

1303
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:37,521
Hey.

1304
01:03:40,067 --> 01:03:42,651
Wanna go on a trip?

1305
01:03:45,906 --> 01:03:47,531
When you were gone I couldn't
catch a buzz

1306
01:03:47,574 --> 01:03:51,076
no matter how hard I tried.

1307
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:53,829
Now I feel high
all the time.

1308
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:01,253
I just wish you felt
the same.

1309
01:04:04,925 --> 01:04:06,424
You know me, Jean.

1310
01:04:06,468 --> 01:04:08,343
I've always had
my ups and downs.

1311
01:04:08,387 --> 01:04:11,763
Yeah, but not this bad.

1312
01:04:11,807 --> 01:04:13,598
Not like this.

1313
01:04:19,982 --> 01:04:21,648
You know you can
tell me anything.

1314
01:04:21,692 --> 01:04:23,984
[knocking]

1315
01:04:27,406 --> 01:04:29,030
Don't move.

1316
01:04:34,496 --> 01:04:36,413
Hello.

1317
01:04:37,708 --> 01:04:41,167
I'm sorry if my arrival
is uncomfortable for you.

1318
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:42,711
But this?

1319
01:04:42,754 --> 01:04:44,212
This is bullshit.

1320
01:04:44,256 --> 01:04:46,381
Jim just came back so he could
sponge off of you.

1321
01:04:46,425 --> 01:04:49,342
He's not sponging off of me.

1322
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:51,469
He left you.

1323
01:04:51,513 --> 01:04:54,014
He loves me.

1324
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:55,432
And you need to face that.

1325
01:04:55,475 --> 01:04:57,309
Oh honey, you just don't get it,
do you?

1326
01:04:57,352 --> 01:04:59,436
His body, it may be here,
but his heart?

1327
01:04:59,479 --> 01:05:01,354
It belongs with me.

1328
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:03,732
Tell her that's not true.

1329
01:05:05,777 --> 01:05:07,736
She's my wife.

1330
01:05:07,779 --> 01:05:09,362
I love her.

1331
01:05:09,406 --> 01:05:11,031
I'm not leaving her.

1332
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:12,324
I'm sorry, Peggy.

1333
01:05:12,367 --> 01:05:14,784
You're a fool, Jim Huden.

1334
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:19,497
You know, the cops called me.

1335
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:20,957
What?

1336
01:05:21,001 --> 01:05:23,251
You better watch yourself, Jim.

1337
01:05:24,296 --> 01:05:26,671
[door opens, closes]

1338
01:05:28,717 --> 01:05:31,301
What was she talking about?

1339
01:05:36,141 --> 01:05:39,309
You remember what I told you
about my step-father?

1340
01:05:39,353 --> 01:05:41,519
Yeah.

1341
01:05:41,563 --> 01:05:45,482
Something happened
on Whidbey Island.

1342
01:05:45,525 --> 01:05:48,276
What? What do you mean?

1343
01:05:49,696 --> 01:05:52,781
Well, I did it, Jean.

1344
01:05:52,824 --> 01:05:54,950
I did it.

1345
01:05:59,206 --> 01:06:01,456
I was hoping you'd call again.

1346
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:04,709
I didn't know if I was gonna,
but...

1347
01:06:04,753 --> 01:06:08,296
I keep seeing that poor guy
getting shot in the face.

1348
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:10,548
Well, I'm glad
you did call back.

1349
01:06:10,592 --> 01:06:13,426
Yeah, well, whatever.

1350
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:16,137
I heard something
kinda urgent.

1351
01:06:16,181 --> 01:06:17,597
Go on.

1352
01:06:17,641 --> 01:06:19,474
The shooter's planning
on flying to Vegas

1353
01:06:19,518 --> 01:06:22,018
to visit his girlfriend.

1354
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:27,023
Uh, by girlfriend you're
referring to uh...

1355
01:06:27,067 --> 01:06:28,441
Peggy Sue Thomas?

1356
01:06:30,362 --> 01:06:33,405
[sighs]
Yeah, Peggy.

1357
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:36,491
She was just here and they had
a big fight.

1358
01:06:36,535 --> 01:06:39,869
He's afraid that
she's mad at him.

1359
01:06:39,913 --> 01:06:41,788
Plus, he wants to make sure

1360
01:06:41,832 --> 01:06:44,040
that they have
their stories straight.

1361
01:06:44,084 --> 01:06:47,085
So he's going to Vegas soon.

1362
01:06:47,129 --> 01:06:50,046
You should probably
get to him first.

1363
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:51,715
Well, it's tough for us
to catch this guy

1364
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:54,217
if we don't know his name.

1365
01:06:55,095 --> 01:06:56,678
Sir, are you still there?

1366
01:06:58,181 --> 01:06:59,597
Jim Huden.

1367
01:07:00,892 --> 01:07:04,728
His name is Jim Huden
and he lives in Punta Gorda.

1368
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:06,688
And who am I speaking to?

1369
01:07:12,029 --> 01:07:15,739
My name is Neil Dodson.

1370
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:17,991
I'm his best friend.

1371
01:07:20,829 --> 01:07:21,786
[hangs up]

1372
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:24,414
Uh, hello? Sir?

1373
01:07:24,458 --> 01:07:25,415
Uh, we need to get some-

1374
01:07:25,459 --> 01:07:27,375
Search warrants.
I'm on it.

1375
01:07:53,070 --> 01:07:56,696
Well, it's been a couple
days now.

1376
01:07:56,740 --> 01:08:01,576
Are you gonna...
say something or what?

1377
01:08:02,496 --> 01:08:05,371
That was a lot to take in, Jim.

1378
01:08:14,424 --> 01:08:21,679
But honestly, I've...
I've never felt closer to you.

1379
01:08:21,723 --> 01:08:25,266
And I understand
why you did it.

1380
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:28,186
You had demons to slay.

1381
01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:29,395
Thanks.

1382
01:08:33,026 --> 01:08:37,695
I do have to take a quick trip
to Vegas.

1383
01:08:37,739 --> 01:08:38,738
What?

1384
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,407
Why?

1385
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:43,076
[knocking]

1386
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:46,704
[knocking]

1387
01:08:50,961 --> 01:08:52,293
Jim Huden?

1388
01:08:52,337 --> 01:08:54,295
Yeah.

1389
01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:56,005
Detective Steadman.

1390
01:08:56,049 --> 01:08:57,757
Whidbey Island Police.

1391
01:08:57,801 --> 01:09:00,176
Mind if I ask you
a couple questions?

1392
01:09:01,805 --> 01:09:03,263
Peggy Sue Thomas?

1393
01:09:03,306 --> 01:09:04,556
Yes.

1394
01:09:04,599 --> 01:09:06,641
Detective Williams,
Whidbey Island PD.

1395
01:09:06,685 --> 01:09:08,893
We spoke on the phone.

1396
01:09:08,937 --> 01:09:10,895
Come on in.

1397
01:09:32,169 --> 01:09:35,879
Someone ambushed
Russel Douglas.

1398
01:09:35,922 --> 01:09:37,714
Now, I've been told
that you were the man

1399
01:09:37,757 --> 01:09:39,299
that pulled the trigger.

1400
01:09:39,342 --> 01:09:40,758
I don't know why someone
would say that.

1401
01:09:40,802 --> 01:09:43,344
I- I've never even owned a gun.

1402
01:09:43,388 --> 01:09:44,387
Ok.

1403
01:09:45,098 --> 01:09:47,849
Who told you that?

1404
01:09:47,893 --> 01:09:51,686
I'm not about to disclose
my source, Mr. Huden.

1405
01:09:54,983 --> 01:09:59,569
Damn, I knew she was pissed off
at me, but...

1406
01:09:59,613 --> 01:10:01,696
is Peggy angry enough
that she'd try to frame me

1407
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:04,032
for Russel's murder?

1408
01:10:04,075 --> 01:10:06,659
We believe you were involved
in Russel Douglas's murder.

1409
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:10,038
What brings you to that
ridiculous conclusion?

1410
01:10:10,081 --> 01:10:13,249
Jim Huden mentioned you
in connection to the crime.

1411
01:10:13,293 --> 01:10:15,919
I really doubt that,
but nice try.

1412
01:10:15,962 --> 01:10:17,754
We also have a sworn statement

1413
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:21,716
from a good friend
of Jim Huden's.

1414
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,218
I don't believe you.

1415
01:10:23,261 --> 01:10:25,011
Maybe you know him.

1416
01:10:25,055 --> 01:10:27,639
Neil Dodson.

1417
01:10:27,682 --> 01:10:30,558
So that's all you have
is hearsay.

1418
01:10:30,602 --> 01:10:32,060
Do you have any real evidence?

1419
01:10:32,103 --> 01:10:34,062
I'll ask the questions, Peggy.

1420
01:10:34,105 --> 01:10:37,398
What about a murder weapon?

1421
01:10:37,442 --> 01:10:38,900
Have you ever owned a gun,
Miss Thomas?

1422
01:10:38,944 --> 01:10:39,776
No.

1423
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:45,490
So, you have no murder weapon,
what about a motive?

1424
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:47,158
I mean, what possible reason

1425
01:10:47,202 --> 01:10:49,118
could I have for wanting
Russel Douglas dead?

1426
01:10:49,162 --> 01:10:51,079
We have our theories.

1427
01:10:51,122 --> 01:10:54,165
No, you don't have anything,
Detective Williams.

1428
01:10:54,209 --> 01:10:55,959
Sugar?

1429
01:10:56,002 --> 01:10:58,670
She's so smug you just wanna
slap that smirk off her face.

1430
01:10:58,713 --> 01:10:59,837
Mmmhmm.

1431
01:10:59,881 --> 01:11:01,589
Well, Jim Huden
is no prize, either.

1432
01:11:01,633 --> 01:11:04,342
Oh, about that time.

1433
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:08,179
You really think this is
gonna help?

1434
01:11:08,223 --> 01:11:09,514
Somebody out there
knows something.

1435
01:11:09,557 --> 01:11:11,099
It's worth a try.

1436
01:11:11,142 --> 01:11:12,600
We now turn your attention

1437
01:11:12,644 --> 01:11:14,435
to the Whidbey Island
Police Department.

1438
01:11:14,479 --> 01:11:17,313
This is Detective Todd Steadman of the Whidbey Police Department

1439
01:11:17,357 --> 01:11:18,564
with a special announcement.

1440
01:11:18,608 --> 01:11:20,316
We are asking for
the public's help

1441
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:22,026
in a homicide investigation.

1442
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:25,071
Former Whidbey Island residence
James Huden and Peggy Thomas

1443
01:11:25,115 --> 01:11:26,656
have been identified
as persons of interest

1444
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:28,825
in the Russel Douglas murder.

1445
01:11:31,788 --> 01:11:33,413
[knocking]

1446
01:11:36,167 --> 01:11:37,917
You're back.
How nice.

1447
01:11:37,961 --> 01:11:39,585
Isn't it, though?

1448
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:42,922
The last time we spoke
you seemed disappointed

1449
01:11:42,966 --> 01:11:45,091
that we hadn't found
the murder weapon.

1450
01:11:45,135 --> 01:11:47,468
Do you recognize this gun?

1451
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:50,305
No.

1452
01:11:50,348 --> 01:11:52,557
One of Jim Huden's friends
was holding onto it for him.

1453
01:11:52,642 --> 01:11:54,726
So?

1454
01:11:54,769 --> 01:11:57,520
We found your fingerprints
on the gun manual.

1455
01:11:57,564 --> 01:11:58,771
And?

1456
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:01,441
And now we're gonna search
your house.

1457
01:12:01,484 --> 01:12:02,900
Gentlemen?

1458
01:12:11,995 --> 01:12:12,952
[phone ringing]

1459
01:12:15,206 --> 01:12:16,372
Hello?

1460
01:12:16,416 --> 01:12:17,790
Put him on the phone.

1461
01:12:18,543 --> 01:12:20,293
It's Peggy.

1462
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:22,420
[slam]

1463
01:12:26,051 --> 01:12:27,258
Yes, Peggy?

1464
01:12:27,302 --> 01:12:29,177
You didn't get rid of the gun?

1465
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:31,012
The gun?

1466
01:12:31,056 --> 01:12:32,347
I... I didn't keep it.

1467
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:33,598
No!

1468
01:12:33,641 --> 01:12:35,641
You gave it to a friend
to hang onto!

1469
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:37,185
And then you confessed
the entire thing

1470
01:12:37,228 --> 01:12:39,187
to your bass player!

1471
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:40,563
How did you know?

1472
01:12:40,607 --> 01:12:42,023
Because the cops
were just here!

1473
01:12:42,067 --> 01:12:43,316
They're the ones
that told me!

1474
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:44,650
Peggy.

1475
01:12:44,694 --> 01:12:45,735
Jim, I am absolutely
not going to prison

1476
01:12:45,779 --> 01:12:46,903
because of your
poor judgement.

1477
01:12:46,946 --> 01:12:48,446
Do you understand me?

1478
01:12:48,490 --> 01:12:51,324
Ok? They've searched my house,
they impounded my car.

1479
01:12:51,368 --> 01:12:53,951
Ok, we'll figure this out,
I just...

1480
01:12:53,995 --> 01:12:55,370
I didn't- I didn't think-

1481
01:12:55,413 --> 01:12:56,496
Oh, no, Jim.

1482
01:12:56,539 --> 01:12:57,789
No, Jim, you didn't think.

1483
01:12:57,832 --> 01:12:59,540
You didn't think at all, ok?

1484
01:12:59,584 --> 01:13:01,626
If I go to prison
it's all on you!

1485
01:13:01,669 --> 01:13:04,045
All on you!!!

1486
01:13:08,593 --> 01:13:10,802
So you tell me
you killed someone

1487
01:13:10,845 --> 01:13:12,178
and now you're just
gonna disappear

1488
01:13:12,222 --> 01:13:13,805
with the last of our cash?

1489
01:13:13,848 --> 01:13:16,974
And enough of my Oxy
to kill an elephant?!

1490
01:13:17,018 --> 01:13:20,019
Yeah, I saw what you packed.

1491
01:13:20,063 --> 01:13:22,772
It's not worth killing
yourself over.

1492
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:29,654
I love you, Jean.

1493
01:13:29,697 --> 01:13:31,656
I love you.

1494
01:13:41,126 --> 01:13:44,502
So we still don't have anything
on Peggy.

1495
01:13:44,546 --> 01:13:45,962
And Jim?

1496
01:13:47,549 --> 01:13:49,632
All these months and we're
no closer to finding him.

1497
01:13:49,676 --> 01:13:52,260
I keep thinking if I look
hard enough

1498
01:13:52,303 --> 01:13:54,095
I'll find something new.

1499
01:13:54,139 --> 01:13:56,556
Well, I doubt Jim Huden is
hiding in these photographs.

1500
01:13:56,599 --> 01:13:58,516
Well, then where the hell
is he?

1501
01:13:59,978 --> 01:14:02,645
When Jim vanished those
were really dark times for me.

1502
01:14:02,689 --> 01:14:05,440
A lesser woman might have been
destroyed by what I went through

1503
01:14:05,483 --> 01:14:07,608
but if there's one thing
you can say about me

1504
01:14:07,652 --> 01:14:09,485
it's that I'm resilient.

1505
01:14:09,529 --> 01:14:11,946
You never fail to amaze me,
Peggy.

1506
01:14:11,990 --> 01:14:15,950
They say rebound romances
don't work and yet here you are.

1507
01:14:15,994 --> 01:14:17,201
Mmm.

1508
01:14:17,245 --> 01:14:19,245
Here I am.

1509
01:14:19,289 --> 01:14:20,371
It's beautiful.

1510
01:14:20,415 --> 01:14:22,373
It is, isn't it?

1511
01:14:22,417 --> 01:14:24,250
You know, Mark has
so much real estate

1512
01:14:24,294 --> 01:14:26,836
the whole family
could move down here.

1513
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,005
Has he agreed to that?

1514
01:14:29,048 --> 01:14:31,466
He will. He just doesn't
know it yet.

1515
01:14:31,509 --> 01:14:32,800
[laughs]

1516
01:14:32,844 --> 01:14:34,135
Ooh, bubbly.

1517
01:14:36,181 --> 01:14:36,929
[pop]

1518
01:14:36,973 --> 01:14:38,306
[gasp]

1519
01:14:38,349 --> 01:14:39,599
Peggy: The end of my marriage
to Mark

1520
01:14:39,642 --> 01:14:42,435
was also the end of
my financial troubles.

1521
01:14:42,479 --> 01:14:44,645
My heartbreak over losing
him was soothed

1522
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:48,483
by a brand new houseboat,
a ranch, and several cars.

1523
01:14:48,526 --> 01:14:50,401
If there's one thing you can
say about me

1524
01:14:50,445 --> 01:14:53,613
it's that I am resilient.

1525
01:14:53,656 --> 01:14:55,114
That is so unfair.

1526
01:14:55,158 --> 01:14:57,408
The other insurance
company paid me.

1527
01:14:57,452 --> 01:14:59,535
Agent: Ma'am, the policy on
pre-existing conditions
does not include...

1528
01:14:59,579 --> 01:15:01,037
That money is long gone.

1529
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:02,205
Watch your fingers.

1530
01:15:02,248 --> 01:15:03,539
I'm a grieving widow.

1531
01:15:03,583 --> 01:15:06,209
How can you deny my claim?

1532
01:15:06,252 --> 01:15:08,002
Why should I be punished

1533
01:15:08,046 --> 01:15:10,213
because Russel didn't tell you
about his heart murmur?

1534
01:15:10,256 --> 01:15:12,215
This is a policy that has...

1535
01:15:15,303 --> 01:15:18,137
I've been keeping tabs
on the key players.

1536
01:15:18,181 --> 01:15:20,640
Brenna bought a house
then lost it to foreclosure.

1537
01:15:20,683 --> 01:15:23,351
Peggy got married
and divorced.

1538
01:15:23,394 --> 01:15:25,228
Williams: And what about
Jean Huden?

1539
01:15:25,271 --> 01:15:27,313
Jim's long-suffering wife.

1540
01:15:27,357 --> 01:15:30,358
Well, her suffering
is about to get worse.

1541
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:32,151
What's that mean?

1542
01:15:32,195 --> 01:15:33,986
I just spoke to the Punta Gorda
Chief of Police.

1543
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:35,404
Good news.

1544
01:15:35,448 --> 01:15:37,156
I'm heading back to Florida.

1545
01:15:38,076 --> 01:15:39,116
Mmmhmm.

1546
01:15:39,953 --> 01:15:42,036
[knocking]

1547
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:42,662
Police!

1548
01:15:42,705 --> 01:15:44,247
Shit.

1549
01:15:46,543 --> 01:15:48,751
[knocking]

1550
01:15:51,756 --> 01:15:53,172
[knocking]

1551
01:15:54,759 --> 01:15:57,718
Police! Open up!

1552
01:15:57,762 --> 01:15:58,761
Oh, god.

1553
01:16:04,602 --> 01:16:05,893
Mrs. Huden.

1554
01:16:05,937 --> 01:16:07,687
You've been charged
on 18 separate counts

1555
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:13,734
ranging from possession to fraud
to grand larceny.

1556
01:16:13,778 --> 01:16:15,611
Those are very serious charges.

1557
01:16:15,655 --> 01:16:17,488
Yeah, I know.

1558
01:16:17,532 --> 01:16:19,323
I know.

1559
01:16:19,367 --> 01:16:22,118
Obviously you're struggling.

1560
01:16:22,161 --> 01:16:25,288
Your husband cheated on you

1561
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:28,916
and he left you dealing with
the aftermath of his crime.

1562
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:32,003
I loved that man so much.

1563
01:16:32,046 --> 01:16:34,297
And look where
it's gotten you.

1564
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:36,924
I have been so stupid.

1565
01:16:39,137 --> 01:16:44,890
Jean, you could go to jail
for a long, long time.

1566
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:46,767
Or you could tell us
where Jim-

1567
01:16:46,811 --> 01:16:48,436
He's in Mexico.

1568
01:16:50,690 --> 01:16:54,650
He's teaching guitar.

1569
01:16:54,694 --> 01:16:57,778
They call him "Maestro Jim".

1570
01:16:58,823 --> 01:17:04,076
[strumming]

1571
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:05,453
Steadman: Jim Huden.

1572
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:10,207
Hello, Peggy.

1573
01:17:10,251 --> 01:17:12,251
Oh, you again.

1574
01:17:12,295 --> 01:17:13,711
I have something for you.

1575
01:17:13,796 --> 01:17:15,379
What is it?

1576
01:17:15,423 --> 01:17:19,300
You're under arrest for
the murder of Russel Douglas.

1577
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:23,387
Special delivery
from Whidbey Island.

1578
01:17:23,431 --> 01:17:24,555
What is it?

1579
01:17:24,599 --> 01:17:26,807
It's a warrant for your arrest.

1580
01:17:26,851 --> 01:17:28,934
I need you to turn around and
put your hands behind your back.

1581
01:17:28,978 --> 01:17:30,227
No, you are not putting
those on me.

1582
01:17:30,271 --> 01:17:31,354
Actually, I am.

1583
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:32,563
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1584
01:17:32,607 --> 01:17:33,648
-Peggy Sue Thomas.
-You can't do this!

1585
01:17:33,691 --> 01:17:34,982
You can't arrest me!

1586
01:17:35,026 --> 01:17:35,775
-You have been charged.
-I didn't do anything.

1587
01:17:35,818 --> 01:17:37,610
-with first degree murder.

1588
01:17:37,654 --> 01:17:39,070
-I didn't do anything wrong!

1589
01:17:39,113 --> 01:17:40,154
-You have the right
to remain silent.

1590
01:17:40,198 --> 01:17:41,697
-You can't make me...

1591
01:17:41,741 --> 01:17:43,282
-Everything you say can
and will be used against you...

1592
01:17:43,326 --> 01:17:45,534
-I don't even have shoes on!
Will you please let me go back-

1593
01:17:48,289 --> 01:17:51,749
Russel Douglas's death
was not just a murder.

1594
01:17:51,793 --> 01:17:53,626
It was an assassination.

1595
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:57,254
Jim Huden walked up
to Russel's car,

1596
01:17:57,298 --> 01:18:02,677
looked him in the eye,
and shot him point blank.

1597
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:06,555
I met Jim Huden but, uh,
I didn't really know him.

1598
01:18:06,599 --> 01:18:09,266
Did you tell Peggy Sue Thomas
that your husband, Russel,

1599
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:11,394
had been abusive?

1600
01:18:11,437 --> 01:18:13,187
Yeah.

1601
01:18:13,231 --> 01:18:15,856
Jim told me his step-father
used to beat him.

1602
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:18,859
He said "I always hated that man
with a passion.

1603
01:18:18,903 --> 01:18:20,986
"I wanted to find someone
who was just like him

1604
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:22,071
"and get revenge."

1605
01:18:22,115 --> 01:18:23,698
And did he find someone?

1606
01:18:23,741 --> 01:18:25,866
He thought he had.

1607
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:28,494
Peggy Sue Thomas convinced
him that Russel Douglas

1608
01:18:28,538 --> 01:18:29,662
was an abusive husband.

1610
01:18:33,835 --> 01:18:35,501
Will the defendant please rise?

1611
01:18:38,715 --> 01:18:40,631
The jury finds the defendant,
Jim Huden,

1612
01:18:40,675 --> 01:18:43,092
guilty of first degree
aggravated murder.

1614
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:46,387
[courtroom chatter]

1615
01:18:51,227 --> 01:18:53,185
Peggy: It took the jury eight
days to sentence Jim

1616
01:18:53,229 --> 01:18:54,520
to 80 years in prison.

1617
01:18:54,564 --> 01:18:55,604
80 years.

1618
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:56,814
That's twice the normal
sentence.

1619
01:18:56,858 --> 01:18:59,233
I'm so lucky to be out
on bail.

1620
01:18:59,277 --> 01:19:00,693
Thoughts?

1621
01:19:02,113 --> 01:19:03,821
It's very Peggy.

1622
01:19:04,782 --> 01:19:06,824
And?

1623
01:19:06,868 --> 01:19:09,952
Maybe for a murder trial you
might wanna tone it down a bit.

1624
01:19:09,996 --> 01:19:12,413
See, that's why I love you.
You're very sensible.

1625
01:19:12,457 --> 01:19:13,998
Not that it matters
what I wear.

1626
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:16,500
If there's any justice at all
I'll be exonerated.

1627
01:19:16,544 --> 01:19:19,503
D.A.: Mr. Huden, you've been sentenced to 80 years in prison.

1628
01:19:19,547 --> 01:19:22,631
Now if Ms. Thomas has played
any role in this murder,

1629
01:19:22,675 --> 01:19:24,592
volunteering that information

1630
01:19:24,635 --> 01:19:27,845
could result in a significant
reduction in your sentence.

1631
01:19:27,889 --> 01:19:32,600
Again, I plead the fifth.

1632
01:19:32,643 --> 01:19:35,019
Of course, Jim refused
to testify against me.

1633
01:19:35,062 --> 01:19:37,313
They don't have a single witness
that links me to this crime.

1634
01:19:37,356 --> 01:19:38,731
I thought his wife
claimed to-

1635
01:19:38,775 --> 01:19:40,858
Jean Huden, the druggie
with an axe to grind?

1636
01:19:40,902 --> 01:19:42,234
Uh, unreliable.

1637
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:43,778
What about Jim's buddy,
the bass player?

1638
01:19:43,821 --> 01:19:44,945
What, Neil Dodson?

1639
01:19:44,989 --> 01:19:46,238
Oh, he's not testifying.

1640
01:19:46,282 --> 01:19:47,823
He's in the hospital
in critical condition

1641
01:19:47,867 --> 01:19:49,408
because he had
a heart attack.

1642
01:19:49,452 --> 01:19:51,285
[chuckles]
Karma's a bitch,
right?

1643
01:19:51,329 --> 01:19:52,912
I suppose.

1644
01:19:52,955 --> 01:19:54,205
You know, I have heard rumours
about a third witness

1645
01:19:54,248 --> 01:19:56,373
but I have no idea
who it could be.

1646
01:19:57,877 --> 01:20:00,878
I can't eat.
I can't sleep.

1647
01:20:00,922 --> 01:20:03,005
My hair is falling out.

1648
01:20:03,049 --> 01:20:05,216
I know this is hard.

1649
01:20:05,259 --> 01:20:07,802
But I really appreciate you
coming forward like this.

1650
01:20:07,845 --> 01:20:11,138
I can't stop thinking about

1651
01:20:11,182 --> 01:20:15,810
Russel sitting in his car alone,
and then...

1652
01:20:15,853 --> 01:20:16,977

[sniffles]

1654
01:20:19,190 --> 01:20:21,732
How can people be so cruel?

1655
01:20:21,776 --> 01:20:25,903
I often wonder that myself.

1656
01:20:25,947 --> 01:20:27,655
Let's go through this
one more time.

1657
01:20:29,909 --> 01:20:33,536
We were discussing
my ex-husband

1658
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:37,456
and Jim said "I can take him
out for you".

1659
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:40,084
And what did you interpret
that to mean?

1660
01:20:40,127 --> 01:20:41,877
It was clear what he meant.

1661
01:20:42,839 --> 01:20:44,213
And Peggy?

1662
01:20:45,299 --> 01:20:49,385
She just sat there, listening.

1663
01:20:49,428 --> 01:20:52,721
Look, I know it's hard
to talk about this.

1664
01:20:52,765 --> 01:20:55,891
It takes a lot of courage.

1665
01:20:55,935 --> 01:20:57,768
Just try to get some rest.

1666
01:20:57,812 --> 01:20:59,395
Yeah.

1667
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:02,773
I'm so tired.

1668
01:21:04,402 --> 01:21:06,360
I need sleep.

1669
01:21:11,242 --> 01:21:12,950
Thank you.

1670
01:21:55,161 --> 01:21:56,785
Given my client's
unique circumstances,

1671
01:21:56,829 --> 01:21:58,704
we're requesting a trial delay

1672
01:21:58,748 --> 01:22:00,873
so that she can tie up
loose ends.

1673
01:22:00,917 --> 01:22:01,749
Loose ends?

1674
01:22:01,792 --> 01:22:03,542
Mmmhmm.

1675
01:22:03,586 --> 01:22:06,670
Well, I may not be familiar
with the nuances, as you put it.

1676
01:22:06,714 --> 01:22:10,132
But I do know that your request
is highly unusual.

1677
01:22:12,136 --> 01:22:14,136
My client would like to speak.

1678
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:15,387
Go on.

1679
01:22:15,431 --> 01:22:17,473
Your honour, I'd just like
to explain.

1680
01:22:17,516 --> 01:22:20,142
I need to attend a memorial
service for my sister

1681
01:22:20,186 --> 01:22:22,186
who recently took
her own life.

1682
01:22:22,229 --> 01:22:24,104
Your honour, may I remind you
that Ms. Thomas

1683
01:22:24,148 --> 01:22:26,899
is referring to her late
half-sister, Janice Nevins,

1684
01:22:26,943 --> 01:22:28,484
who gave a sworn statement
against her

1685
01:22:28,527 --> 01:22:29,902
before she committed suicide.

1686
01:22:29,946 --> 01:22:32,613
In addition, your honour,
I need to raise money

1687
01:22:32,657 --> 01:22:34,657
to pay to fight these
ridiculous charges.

1688
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:36,700
I need to liquidate assets.

1689
01:22:36,744 --> 01:22:40,079
I must maintain my home
and my garden in keeping

1690
01:22:40,122 --> 01:22:42,247
with the standards of the
Homeowner's Association

1691
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:43,916
of my gated community.

1692
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:46,168
I need to go to the dentist
in Nevada,

1693
01:22:46,212 --> 01:22:48,295
I need to winterize
my houseboat,

1694
01:22:48,339 --> 01:22:52,091
and I need to retrieve documents
that'll be useful in my defence.

1695
01:22:52,134 --> 01:22:54,718
I also need to get
winter clothing.

1696
01:22:54,762 --> 01:22:56,845
And I need to transport
my vehicle to Whidbey

1697
01:22:56,889 --> 01:22:58,931
so that I can use it
during the trial.

1698
01:22:58,975 --> 01:23:01,684
Your honour, we do have dentists
here in Washington State.

1699
01:23:01,727 --> 01:23:03,727
And clothing stores
and rental cars.

1700
01:23:03,771 --> 01:23:06,188
And surely Ms. Thomas can find
someone to cut her grass

1701
01:23:06,232 --> 01:23:07,481
and winterize her boat.

1702
01:23:07,525 --> 01:23:08,857
Valid points, counsellor.

1703
01:23:08,901 --> 01:23:10,484
Most importantly, your honour,

1704
01:23:10,528 --> 01:23:12,611
the prosecution views
Peggy Thomas as a flight risk.

1705
01:23:12,655 --> 01:23:14,321
[laughs]

1706
01:23:14,365 --> 01:23:17,992
Your honour, do I really look
like some desperado outlaw

1707
01:23:18,035 --> 01:23:19,702
on the run?

1708
01:23:20,204 --> 01:23:22,287
My whole world has been thrown
into chaos.

1709
01:23:22,331 --> 01:23:28,877
My lover is gone to prison,
my sister has gone to her grave.

1710
01:23:28,921 --> 01:23:31,213
Ow, that stings.

1711
01:23:31,257 --> 01:23:33,841
Thanks, that's- that's better.

1712
01:23:33,884 --> 01:23:35,509
Anyway, my arraignment's
coming up pretty fast,

1713
01:23:35,553 --> 01:23:37,094
so I wanted to look my best.

1714
01:23:37,138 --> 01:23:39,096
I mean, there's bound
to be tons of people.

1715
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:41,640
Paparazzi, even.

1716
01:23:41,684 --> 01:23:45,144
Plus, they don't let you wear
make-up in prison

1717
01:23:45,187 --> 01:23:47,688
so I thought I'd cover
all my bases.

1718
01:23:47,732 --> 01:23:50,107
I mean, you gotta admit
that it's pretty crazy

1719
01:23:50,151 --> 01:23:52,693
that judge just
let me outta there.

1720
01:23:52,737 --> 01:23:55,779
But in the last two weeks
I have had an epiphany.

1721
01:23:55,823 --> 01:23:58,282
I mean, why would I subject
myself to the public scrutiny

1722
01:23:58,325 --> 01:24:01,994
that an unfair trial
would bring?

1723
01:24:02,038 --> 01:24:06,665
So I decided I don't really want
a trial.

1724
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:11,754
Peggy Sue Thomas,
you have pled guilty

1725
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:14,256
to rendering criminal assistance
in the first degree.

1726
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:16,341
Yes, your honour.

1727
01:24:16,385 --> 01:24:18,302
I- I just wanna be clear,
your honour.

1728
01:24:18,345 --> 01:24:20,179
One thing that we know
for sure now

1729
01:24:20,222 --> 01:24:22,598
based on the court's colloquy
with Ms. Thomas

1730
01:24:22,641 --> 01:24:26,060
is that she did in fact
knowingly, intelligently,
and voluntarily

1731
01:24:26,103 --> 01:24:28,562
admit to her involvement
in assisting Jim Huden

1732
01:24:28,606 --> 01:24:31,398
in connection with the murder
of Russel Douglas.

1733
01:24:31,442 --> 01:24:33,442
I'm sentencing you
to the maximum penalty

1734
01:24:33,486 --> 01:24:35,986
that can be imposed
for this plea.

1735
01:24:36,030 --> 01:24:39,531
Four years in the Washington
State penitentiary.

1738
01:24:50,544 --> 01:24:52,336
Disappointed?

1739
01:24:52,379 --> 01:24:55,172
All that make-up
for nothing?

1740
01:24:56,425 --> 01:24:57,674
Peggy.

1741
01:24:57,718 --> 01:24:59,510
I'm from the Washington
Celebrity News.

1742
01:24:59,553 --> 01:25:00,844
Why'd you do it?

1743
01:25:00,888 --> 01:25:03,597
What makes you so sure
I did?

1744
01:25:04,517 --> 01:25:07,351
Why would I want
Russel Douglas dead?

1745
01:25:07,394 --> 01:25:10,646
I didn't profit from his death
in any way.

1746
01:25:10,689 --> 01:25:12,314
By pleading guilty
to a lesser charge

1747
01:25:12,358 --> 01:25:14,066
I'm avoiding an unfair trial

1748
01:25:14,110 --> 01:25:17,319
along with the insane 45-year
sentence I could have faced.

1749
01:25:19,657 --> 01:25:21,281
As for Brenna Douglas,

1750
01:25:21,325 --> 01:25:23,617
the cops never could connect
her to the murder.

1751
01:25:23,661 --> 01:25:25,160
She was never charged.

1752
01:25:31,794 --> 01:25:34,670
Whereas I've been sentenced
to four years in prison.

1753
01:25:34,713 --> 01:25:37,214
Four years for what?

1754
01:25:37,258 --> 01:25:39,591
For falling in love
with the wrong man?

1755
01:25:39,635 --> 01:25:42,636
And Brenna, all she got
was rid of Russel.

1756
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:44,429
Plus, a big chunk
of insurance money

1757
01:25:44,473 --> 01:25:47,599
and the chance to start all over
again somewhere new.

1758
01:25:47,643 --> 01:25:50,894
She changed her name,
and left Whidbey Island.

1759
01:25:50,938 --> 01:25:52,813
And Sally?

1760
01:25:52,857 --> 01:25:55,315
There's still hope for Sally.

1761
01:25:55,359 --> 01:25:57,776
Lucky them.

1762
01:25:57,820 --> 01:26:00,154
Meanwhile, my life has become
a tabloid story

1763
01:26:00,197 --> 01:26:02,781
with headlines about
"The Beauty Queen Killer".

1764
01:26:02,825 --> 01:26:05,367
Like my looks have anything
to do with this.

1765
01:26:05,411 --> 01:26:07,327
I'm just another victim.

1766
01:26:07,371 --> 01:26:10,914
I'm losing four years of my life
just to appease my accusers.

I did nothing wrong.
