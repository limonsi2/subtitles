3
00:00:57,224 --> 00:01:00,975
Go!

4
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:24,240
Looks
like the kid made it through.

5
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,870
I win, you lose. Money?

6
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,747
We didn't even dap on it dad.

7
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:33,666
Ashley.

8
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,335
Fine.

9
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,353
Okay I'm sorry.

10
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,522
My name's Christian.

11
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:58,439
I was driving around

12
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,274
the neighborhood and I got lost.

13
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,651
So I figured I'd stop by your
house

14
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,528
and ask for directions,
and I noticed your window

15
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,071
was broken, so I thought I'd
just come in-

16
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,491
- Christian, huh?

17
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:14,121
Mark, Mark, Mark,
already in enough trouble

18
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,540
as it is.

19
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,585
Why you gotta go and lie to us?

20
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,878
We don't like robbers.

21
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,965
We don't like rapists.

22
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:26,803
But if there's something
that we fucking hate

23
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,345
it's liars.

24
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,721
Ashley.

25
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:31,558
Yeah?

26
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,767
Can I ask you a
question?

27
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:35,603
What's up?

28
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:41,526
Why are you wearing
sneakers on my nice, clean,

29
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,818
expensive carpet?

30
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,528
For that matter, why are both of
you

31
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,904
wearing your shoes in here?

32
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,282
I mean, you know how
your mother and I feel

33
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:51,450
- about shoes in the house.
- Sorry dad.

34
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,454
Here, let me help you.

35
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,749
Okay I'm sorry, I broke
in.

36
00:06:58,751 --> 00:06:59,919
It's a nice house.

37
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:07,051
I'm aware that it's a nice
house.

38
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,635
I bought this house.

39
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:13,890
And the last thing I need is
you breaking into this house

40
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,559
to tell me how nice my house is.

41
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,729
You often go breaking and
entering into people's homes

42
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:20,605
on Christmas Eve?

43
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:24,483
Is this some kind of new game
you kids have these days?

44
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:27,695
I said I'm sorry, and
I thought no one was home

45
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,238
- so I-
- Oh you thought,

46
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,865
'cause there was no one home,

47
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,744
that would make everything okay.

48
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,124
Excuse me one moment.

49
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,305
Sir, what are you doing?

50
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:58,436
Don't worry about
it, I've done this before.

51
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:02,732
Pussy.

52
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:12,659
There, that should
help with the swelling.

53
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:18,164
I'm not so sure it's gonna help
with this.

54
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:19,958
What is this?

55
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,291
Am I bleeding?

56
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,295
I don't know Mark, are you?

57
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,588
I mean, why would you ask
me if you're bleeding.

58
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,382
I mean, what makes you think

59
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,217
we would know better than you

60
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,844
about what's going on down
there?

61
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,429
It's probably just a scratch.

62
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,056
Probably from when you
were trying to rape me

63
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:37,974
a few minutes ago.

64
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,726
- I wasn't trying anything.
- Oh here we go again.

65
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:43,020
I mean, just when we were
starting to get along,

66
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,108
you start up again with the
lies.

67
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:51,406
All right, my name is Thomas
Craven.

68
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,907
My friends call me Thomas.

69
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,661
- Mr. Crav-
- Uh, uh.

70
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,370
Thomas.

71
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,206
Better.

72
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,708
I was wondering if I
could just explain to you

73
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,544
the situation.

74
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,211
I know, I know how it looks

75
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,212
but I was wondering if
I could just explain-

76
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,381
- Don't listen to his shit, dad.

77
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,383
We aint got time for your
bullshit, Mark

78
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,468
or whatever your fucking name
is.

79
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,095
This motherfucker broke in here

80
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,723
and tried to rape me right
where you're standing, dad.

81
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:22,353
Aint no explaining it, aint
no fucking rocket science.

82
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:27,064
Mark, give me a sec,
sweetheart,

83
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,524
wanna sit over there?

84
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:29,360
Thanks dad.

85
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:46,002
Now, Mark isn't it?

86
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:52,214
So, what's the story Morning
Glory?

87
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,093
And how you making out with that
cut?

88
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:57,887
I'm fine, this is
nothing.

89
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:58,931
Splendid.

90
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,558
I just wanted to
let you know Mr. Crave.

91
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,394
Mmm mmm.

92
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,189
Thomas.

93
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,399
I just want to let you know
I've never done this before.

94
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:13,027
I'm not a thief, I'm not a
criminal.

95
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,738
I've never broken into a house
before.

96
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,698
The truth is, I'm a father,

97
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,992
I lost my job and I have a son

98
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:24,246
and it's Christmas Eve, and
we're running out of money fast.

99
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:26,165
I've never been in this
situation before.

100
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,458
I don't even have enough money

101
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,959
to get him a proper meal.

102
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,211
If you just look into my wallet.

103
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:32,046
Wait, wait, wait, where's his
wallet?

104
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,925
I threw it in his face, it's
there.

105
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:46,062
This?

106
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,064
Yes.

107
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,483
That's my boy.

108
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,318
Cute kid.

109
00:10:55,488 --> 00:11:00,493
So tell me, why did you
choose this specific house

110
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,537
and not the one on the left
or the one on the right

111
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:06,789
or behind, or in front of the
house?

112
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,126
Why this house?

113
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:10,835
I don't know.

114
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,837
It just seemed like a nice
house,

115
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,884
so I figured, nice house
outside, nice things inside.

116
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,593
And like I said, it seemed
like no one was home

117
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,053
and on Christmas Eve that's
pretty

118
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,429
- hard to find.
- He's like a

119
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:25,599
bizarro Santa, instead of
sneaking in and leaving shit,

120
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,935
he's sneaking in and stealing
shit.

121
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,313
Make for a dope ass movie.

122
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:32,565
- Honey-
- So you guys gonna

123
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:33,985
call the cops?

124
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,778
You don't leave us
much choice now do you?

125
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,408
I mean, what would you do
if you were in my position?

126
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,243
I guess.

127
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,494
Gimme a second Mark.

128
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,164
Can you be a sweetheart and go
outside

129
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,125
and make the call?

130
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,002
Sure dad.

131
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:57,756
Attractive girl, huh?

132
00:11:57,758 --> 00:12:00,134
- No, I didn't-
- No, no, no it's all right,

133
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:03,598
I don't mind, I mean, I was
your age once too you know.

134
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,141
I guess.

135
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,809
What?

136
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,061
You calling my daughter ugly?

137
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,980
No, I just don't want to
disrespect you.

138
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,194
You're a funny guy.

139
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:20,571
You don't want to disrespect me?

140
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,907
Yet you break into my house,

141
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,284
you attempt to rape my daughter

142
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:28,495
and you don't have the
courtesy to compliment her

143
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,747
on her looks?

144
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,665
I don't call that respect, Mark.

145
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,292
I call that hypocrisy.

146
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,297
- I didn't mean to say it-
- Yeah you didn't, yeah.

147
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:42,551
I'm starting to feel a little-

148
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,555
- Can I ask you a
question?

149
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:46,388
I guess.

150
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,725
I mean this might be a tad
personal, so.

151
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:50,561
Sure.

152
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,149
Are you attracted to girls?

153
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,777
By girls? Of course,
what are you trying to-

154
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,278
- No, no, no,

155
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,739
I don't mean to offend
you, it's just you know,

156
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:06,742
we're gonna be sitting
here for quite some time

157
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,244
waiting for the police to get
here.

158
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:10,746
And being in this neighborhood,

159
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,748
it could be quite a while
before they show up.

160
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,917
I would expect the opposite
around here.

161
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,378
Protect you rich folks
from us poor people.

162
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,630
Yeah, I'd expect that too.

163
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,549
I'd like that.

164
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:25,678
But sadly, reality
sometimes falls quite far

165
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,351
from expectations, sad.

166
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:36,274
Now, we're gonna have some
time to get to know each other

167
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,442
quite well, Mark.

168
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,779
And that's a good thing isn't
it?

169
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,365
What?

170
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:48,701
You're saying you want to be
arrested?

171
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,703
- It's not that but-
- You break into my house

172
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:53,038
and now you can't wait to break
out?

173
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,665
I don't know.

174
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,958
I don't know how to say this but
like,

175
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,753
- this whole situation-
- They're on their way.

176
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,046
Said since we have
everything under control

177
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:03,299
and he's tied up, might
take a little longer

178
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:05,009
than it usually would.

179
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,428
Some shit going on downtown, I
don't know.

180
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,679
Well you should've told him

181
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,180
that we have some nigger here
trying-

182
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:13,434
- Dad! I hate when you use that
word.

183
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:14,977
We're not in the 1940's anymore,

184
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:15,978
what the fuck is wrong with you?

185
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,605
You hear how she talks to me?

186
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:21,025
Kids today, they're so
sensitive.

187
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,402
You know, you can't call
a nigger a nigger now.

188
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,404
You gotta say N-word.

189
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,822
Or you could say Black person

190
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,533
like every other
non-racist person post 1965

191
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,327
- but who's counting?
- I'm counting.

192
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:32,997
I'm surprised you can count.

193
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:37,875
Fuck that shit dad.

194
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,172
You really think he gives a
shit in the state he's in?

195
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,714
What state?

196
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:47,678
Remember that cut we
were looking at before?

197
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,347
It turns out, it might be a lot
worse

198
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,349
than we originally thought.

199
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:54,185
What?

200
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:01,315
What is this? I'm bleeding out
here.

201
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,442
Can you check under my shirt
please?

202
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,276
What is wrong with me?

203
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,986
Can you lift up my shirt
for a second please?

204
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,697
- You fucking did this to me.
- Hey, let me remind you

205
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,325
that you're the one that
broke into my house.

206
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,997
I am not the criminal
here, you are, not us.

207
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,755
Can you look after our
friend for a while Ashley?

208
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,925
I think I can do that.

209
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:37,311
You know, I read somewhere

210
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,897
worse thing you can do
when you're bleeding a lot

211
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:45,111
is fall asleep, you might not
wake up.

212
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,863
You know, I have an idea,
we should keep talking,

213
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,450
keep you from falling asleep.

214
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,535
I'm sorry but like, I don't
really

215
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:55,871
wanna talk right now, so.

216
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:00,207
All right, suit yourself.

217
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,085
But if you start falling asleep,

218
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,586
I aint gonna wake you up.

219
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,713
Just saying, just trying to
help.

220
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:08,465
Fine, what do you want to talk

221
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,008
- about?
- Yes, okay!

222
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,302
- I'll start, so-
- No, I'll start.

223
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,596
Why do you care if I pass out or
whatever?

224
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:15,431
I got caught robbing your house

225
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,433
and I'm supposed to believe
you two are trying to help me

226
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:18,269
or some shit?

227
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:21,770
I don't know.

228
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:25,107
I guess we're just good people
like that.

229
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,276
Not everyone's a fucking
criminal, Mark.

230
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,695
Why you gotta be so negative?

231
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,406
I'm negative?

232
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,407
You're the one that lied
about me trying to rape you

233
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,033
and now I'm supposed to believe

234
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,994
you didn't fuck with my stomach
too?

235
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,082
We didn't fuck with your
stomach, okay?

236
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,753
But who's to say you
didn't try and rape me?

237
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:50,801
What, am I supposed to take
your fucking word for it?

238
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:53,929
Were you?

239
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,681
Were you trying to have sex with
me?

240
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,810
I wasn't trying anything, you
know this.

241
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,394
You fucking know this.

242
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:07,401
So you weren't
trying to break into my house.

243
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,364
Except for that.

244
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,701
Are you sure Mark?

245
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,122
Are you sure you weren't
trying to fuck me?

246
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,877
What if I were to tell you

247
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,881
that I want you to fuck me?

248
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:34,053
Would you? Would you fuck me
Mark?

249
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:35,969
What the fuck is wrong with
you?

250
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,598
Get the fuck off of me.

251
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,808
Chill you fucking pussy.

252
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,811
Just trying to keep your ass
awake, bitch.

253
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:49,485
You really think
I'd let you have sex with me?

254
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:54,738
Oh, this is gonna be
the best Christmas ever.

255
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,743
You're fucking crazy,
don't fucking talk to me.

256
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,538
I told you not to do that
Mark.

257
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,582
And there you go passing out
again.

258
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:08,418
Oh and Mark, if you think this
is crazy

259
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,798
you aint seen nothing yet.

260
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,184
Oh, I feel so fucking lame

261
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,478
walking around in this dumb
outfit.

262
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,021
I was gonna go home and
change before I met you

263
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,399
but I was supposed to be
home like, four hours ago.

264
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,317
But of course, after the
pep rally we went to Stacy's

265
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,527
for drinks and shit.

266
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,237
Anyways, I forgot my keys at
home

267
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,572
so I guess I'm gonna have to
sneak in

268
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:38,115
up the window or some shit.

269
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,327
Like I'm dressed for this shit
now.

270
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:44,037
You would have went home to
change?

271
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,667
You do know you're 30 minutes
late, right?

272
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:50,794
Well, I can leave if you'd
like.

273
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,254
No, that's not what I'm
saying.

274
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,090
It's just, nevermind, forget it.

275
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,093
Oh, Chris.

276
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,179
It's okay.

277
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:05,269
Forgiven.

278
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:07,644
Now what are we eating?

279
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,772
I'm fucking starving,
cheerleading is killing me.

280
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:14,109
I don't know, what do you want
to eat?

281
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:17,154
Fuck it, you decide for me.

282
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,742
Surprise me, let's see
how well you know me.

283
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,034
I barely know you.

284
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:24,912
Come on, you're no fun
sometimes.

285
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,498
You never wanna try anything.

286
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,793
Okay, you know what?

287
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,505
I think I do know what you'd
like.

288
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,051
Excuse me? Miss?

289
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,010
Miss?

290
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,219
What are you calling her miss
for?

291
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,640
She's like, younger than us.

292
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:44,683
Yes?

293
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:49,229
Can I get the deluxe
burger and no cheese please.

294
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:51,980
Pickles on there?

295
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,859
Oh, no thanks, I can't stand
pickles.

296
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,653
All right, and what
will the lady be having?

297
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:00,155
Bring her a Philly
cheese steak.

298
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:02,701
Oh, interesting
choice.

299
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,494
All right, coming right up.

300
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:07,996
Anything else you guys
want, just give me a buzz.

301
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:08,832
Thanks.

302
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,625
Why can't you like,
ever order for yourself?

303
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:12,834
I mean, it's kinda stressful

304
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:15,212
to always guess what you want to
eat.

305
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,548
I don't know, I think if
we were right for each other

306
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,841
you should be able to know what
I want

307
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,259
more than I could know what I
want.

308
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:23,970
I mean, it's a lot of
pressure.

309
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:26,308
Pressure is good, it
keeps you on your toes.

310
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:30,854
Chris?

311
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,689
Mhmm?

312
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:36,066
Where's my Christmas present?

313
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,237
Well it's not Christmas yet.

314
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:41,949
Well, it's Christmas Eve, so.

315
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,868
Don't worry, I'll get you your
gift.

316
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,079
Well guess what?

317
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,831
You won't have to guess
what I want this time.

318
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,210
I know exactly what I want.

319
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,253
And the best part is,

320
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,507
you won't even have to
spend any money on it.

321
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,633
If we're talking about what
you want,

322
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,009
then what did you want to talk
about

323
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:05,303
that was like, too sensitive to
talk about

324
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,140
over the phone?

325
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:09,683
Was it really that big of
a deal for you to meet me?

326
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:10,517
No, no, no.

327
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,435
Didn't you want to see your
girlfriend

328
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:14,604
- on Christmas Eve?
- I didn't mean it like that.

329
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,190
Okay, if you don't
want

330
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,400
just say you don't want.

331
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:21,027
No need to make a big
fucking deal out of it.

332
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,281
Sounds pretty serious.

333
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:26,950
Well, I heard something.

334
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:27,786
Like what?

335
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,538
Like, something.

336
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,540
Okay well I'm hearing
something all the time.

337
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,876
Literally hearing something
every day.

338
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:37,004
Specific, Ashley.

339
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,340
Something surprising.

340
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:45,927
What the fuck was that?

341
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:48,346
That was surprising.

342
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,765
You know, I'm getting
really sick and tired

343
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:51,099
of your little bitch ass
attitude

344
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,476
I've seen over the past few
weeks.

345
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,603
Hey, look I'm sorry.

346
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:55,937
What did you hear?

347
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,296
Okay.

348
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:21,632
- So?
- What?

349
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,759
What did you hear?

350
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,804
Oh yeah, nevermind, let's just
eat.

351
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,262
Fuck Ashley, I didn't
come here for a burger,

352
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:30,265
I have food at home.

353
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:34,226
Talking about how the food is,

354
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:35,977
how's that cheese steak?

355
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:39,024
Well, let's see.

356
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,121
Good.

357
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,043
This tastes like a fucking
orgasm.

358
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,505
That's a weird comparison.

359
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,885
All right, fine.

360
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:10,679
But this stays between us,
right?

361
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:11,932
Mhmm.

362
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:13,640
Pinky.

363
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,143
Okay, I'm not pinky swearing
you.

364
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:21,940
I heard...

365
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:22,776
Mhmm.

366
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:27,821
That...

367
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:28,657
Yeah?

368
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:32,995
You killed someone before.

369
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:35,831
Is it true?

370
00:23:58,186 --> 00:23:59,146
Oh shit, hey.

371
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,608
Didn't know if you were
coming back or not.

372
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,528
Why did you let me fall
asleep?

373
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,070
I told you I wasn't gonna wake
you up.

374
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:11,325
Think I'm a liar, Mark?

375
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,702
Where's your dad? Thought
he went to call 9-1-1.

376
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,329
First you don't want
to talk

377
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:20,498
and now you don't want to shut
up.

378
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,208
Gotta make up your mind, Mark.

379
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,502
I'm really not feeling
too well right now.

380
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:27,466
No shit, you're like,
totally bleeding out.

381
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,093
Isn't your dad a doctor?

382
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,302
Think he could check me out?

383
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,931
Check you out?

384
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,223
I don't think he rolls that way.

385
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,433
That's not what I meant.

386
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:41,519
No, but seriously.

387
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,104
Him? A doctor?

388
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:45,357
No, a shrink.

389
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:47,776
A shrink isn't a real doctor.

390
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:49,486
But if you have any mommy issues

391
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,488
he might be able to help you
out.

392
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,866
Isn't that the same thing?

393
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:58,246
Is a robber the same thing as
a rapist?

394
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,206
Not even close.

395
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,042
Same thing.

396
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:07,504
So your dad's a shrink?

397
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,341
Yes, Mark.

398
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,011
Well that explains a lot.

399
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,262
What is that supposed to mean?

400
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:18,100
Hey, sorry for the
delay.

401
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,892
Your mom's home.

402
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,980
Family reunion, dining room.

403
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:25,355
Mark and I are just in the
middle of something here-

404
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,898
- Ashley.

405
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,525
Let's go.

406
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:29,903
Fine, chill.

407
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:35,073
But who's gonna watch over
our little birdy here?

408
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,536
Little birdy, stay.

409
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,662
See? Let's go.

410
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:49,713
Hi Ashley.

411
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:50,964
Hi mom.

412
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,757
What did you do this
time?

413
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,592
What do you mean what I did
this time?

414
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:57,679
Watch your tone, is
that how I raised you?

415
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:00,098
I don't know, how
did you fucking raise me?

416
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,435
Can you two calm down please.

417
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:05,061
We're all in the same boat here

418
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:07,522
and that boat is sinking fast.

419
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,734
I mean, can we all just
work together as a team?

420
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:11,943
Just for tonight?

421
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,445
And then when all is said and
done

422
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:16,406
you two can go back to hating
each other.

423
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,700
But for now, we're in a big mess
here,

424
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,286
- a big fucking mess.
- How is this such a big mess?

425
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,038
The way I see it, it's
all pretty fucking simple.

426
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,080
We just let him go.

427
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,541
He takes off into the night,
fade out, roll credits,

428
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:29,044
end of story, what's the big
deal?

429
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:30,336
Am I missing something?

430
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:31,671
You two aren't actually thinking

431
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,506
of calling the cops are you?

432
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:34,549
Should I take this

433
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,968
or do you want to do the honors?

434
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:37,804
Allow me.

435
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:44,017
Honey, let's put all the
potential options

436
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,436
and outcomes on the table.

437
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,270
A very good idea.

438
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,191
Option number one, we let him
go.

439
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,943
He's seriously wounded
and severely bleeding.

440
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,154
The way I see it, if he
doesn't get to a doctor

441
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,697
in the next few hours,

442
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,574
it's curtains for him.

443
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,159
So we let him go.

444
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,202
Now I don't know about you

445
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:05,371
but I'm pretty damn sure
that's a stab wound.

446
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:06,208
What?

447
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,501
Who, between you two geniuses,

448
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:11,836
decided that it would be
a good idea to stab him?

449
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:13,338
Well I know I didn't

450
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,465
and from what I've
seen, I'm pretty certain

451
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,758
Ashley didn't either.

452
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,052
So, to answer your question,

453
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,014
I don't fucking know.

454
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,852
Don't look at
me, I don't fucking know.

455
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:31,523
Ha ha oh okay, so he
breaks into the house,

456
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:33,566
seemingly un-stabbed, you three
bozos

457
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:34,651
get into a playground scuffle,

458
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,736
then all of sudden he's
just magically stabbed.

459
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:37,862
That's your story.

460
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,030
Dad, why are we wasting our
time

461
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,365
with Sherlock Holmes here?

462
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,784
We were doing just fine
until she showed up.

463
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,994
Yes, you were doing
just peachy, trust me,

464
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:45,829
if I knew what you dickheads
were up to

465
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:47,872
I'd be across the state line by
now.

466
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:49,791
Can I continue?

467
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,044
I mean, are you two done?

468
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,630
Please proceed.

469
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,174
Okay, so we let him go.

470
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,426
I don't know about you, but how
much trust

471
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:02,220
do you want to put on a thief?

472
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,555
I mean, all it will take

473
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:05,431
is for him to just point us out

474
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:06,266
and then we're fucked.

475
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:09,060
I don't know, I mean, maybe
we are overthinking this.

476
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,645
I mean really, what is he gonna
do?

477
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:13,356
Go to the cops and be like,
"Yeah I broke into this house

478
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,774
and this chick beat me up

479
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:17,443
and here's her address."

480
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:21,156
It's unlikely, but I
think your father's right

481
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:22,240
on this one.

482
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,825
We can't take this lightly.

483
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:26,286
He got into our house, he
knows what we look like.

484
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:29,080
Well, what you two look like.

485
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,124
You beat him up, tied him up.

486
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:33,209
All it takes is for him to
tell one of his compadres

487
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,336
then who knows where that could
lead us.

488
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:37,505
We can't take that chance.

489
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:39,926
So our only option is
what I think it is then.

490
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:43,803
I don't want to do that.

491
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,388
I don't want to do that
either.

492
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,557
But I don't know, I mean,
what else can we do?

493
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,184
I'm fine with it, really.

494
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:51,603
Ashley calm down, did one of
you forget

495
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:52,562
to lock the doors or something?

496
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,022
How the hell did he get in here?

497
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:55,398
Broke the window.

498
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,233
Ugh, of course he did.

499
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,110
These fancy houses got so many
windows,

500
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,655
we might as well sleep outside.

501
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:05,241
All right, I'm
gonna go talk to the guy.

502
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,329
Talk to him? Fuh what?

503
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,955
Fuh? What's fuh?

504
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:13,416
Vietnamese soup? Where are your
R's?

505
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,251
You're too cool to use R's now?

506
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,127
Thomas, listen to your daughter,

507
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,420
talking like a fucking nigger.

508
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,797
She's not getting that
from me, that's for sure.

509
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,175
You two make a great
couple, y'all know that?

510
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,803
And that's the thanks we get.

511
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:27,180
All right, I'm gonna talk to
him.

512
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,681
Fuck what you two think,
I need to size him up

513
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,058
- for myself.
- You know this motherfucker

514
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,811
tried to rape me, right?

515
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,398
Dad, you told her right?

516
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,357
I told her.

517
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,858
Ashley, listen to me.

518
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,943
We're not just gonna go do

519
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:41,110
what you think we're gonna do

520
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,445
just because you think we should
do it.

521
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,030
This is not just fucking getting
dressed

522
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:44,864
in the morning, all right?

523
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,032
This this is a big deal.

524
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,034
Now, we've got a few hours
until the sun comes up.

525
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:50,328
We need to figure this out,
okay?

526
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,247
Thomas, okay?

527
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:53,414
Your mother's right.

528
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:56,042
I mean, we have to take this
seriously.

529
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,964
I mean, we cannot take this
lightly.

530
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,052
All right.

531
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:06,678
Fine then, talk to him.

532
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,221
See if I fucking care.

533
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,057
Ashley.

534
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:17,148
You know, it was you who
always wanted a daughter.

535
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:20,692
I mean, if you're ever gonna act
on it,

536
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:23,569
I think tonight might be as good
a night

537
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:25,238
as you'll ever get.

538
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,674
I knew you'd forget
to introduce yourself

539
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:45,552
to the neighbors.

540
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:49,012
I'm gonna go get them
a nice bottle of wine

541
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,680
and make a great first
impression

542
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,434
just like they do in the movies.

543
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:55,351
Shit, I bet five bucks you
wouldn't.

544
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,937
We both know I'm the responsible
one.

545
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,605
You're joking, right?

546
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:02,150
Not joking, actually speaking
facts.

547
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:02,984
Facts, yeah.

548
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:05,153
Are you sure you have
the right definition?

549
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:06,696
Have you looked up the meaning?

550
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,657
I did, and it said that I'm
always right

551
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,951
and you're always fucking wrong.

552
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,330
That's what it said anyways.

553
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,706
Yeah, well you're a
funny woman you know that?

554
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,958
That's why I married you.

555
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,961
Your sense of humor.

556
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:28,009
I always thought it was
because of my ass but,

557
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:30,720
I guess sense of humor makes
it sound more romantic.

558
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,140
Well you're welcome.

559
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,558
You know what?

560
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,185
Sending the kid to the arcade
tonight

561
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:38,603
was actually a pretty good idea.

562
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:39,771
Sending the kid any night

563
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:41,024
is always a good idea.

564
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:44,150
Look, I told you, you're
worried for nothing.

565
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:46,488
It's just the arcade,
it's a good neighborhood.

566
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,906
And we can't keep treating
her like a baby anymore.

567
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:53,368
She needs to learn to do things
on her own, make friends.

568
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,828
It's essential to the
development of a good teenager.

569
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,455
Let me know when we're
speaking English again.

570
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,123
Ha ha.

571
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,750
Is she back yet?

572
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:05,004
I don't know, who cares?

573
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,466
I think you're hard on her.

574
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:09,801
I know she's not always easy

575
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:12,597
but it's just, she's a kid.

576
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,056
This is normal kid bullshit.

577
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:17,266
We were kids once, remember?

578
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,311
Years ago.

579
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:22,941
First of all, I don't like
this years ago thing at all.

580
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:28,486
I don't know, I just, I feel
like something's off with her.

581
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:32,031
Just try and not be
too hard on her, okay?

582
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,991
She needs time to adapt.

583
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:35,952
Plus, she just moved into
a completely new city,

584
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,454
this is not easy for her.

585
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,375
Grace, she's going to need her
mother.

586
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:44,544
I swear, something's
wrong with your daughter.

587
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:46,754
Look, I'm sorry but we both know
this.

588
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:49,173
And don't try to psychoanalyze
our relationship now.

589
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:50,009
Fine.

590
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:53,970
I thought the goal of tonight

591
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,933
was to forget about the kid
and work and everything.

592
00:32:58,017 --> 00:33:00,395
Do we really need to talk
about this right now?

593
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:04,649
You're right. I'm sorry.

594
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:11,821
It's okay. I'm happy.

595
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,074
We're celebrating, right?

596
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:14,784
Yeah.

597
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,578
What are we celebrating?

598
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:22,081
We're celebrating no phone
lines.

599
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,210
No your mother living upstairs
from us.

600
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:28,588
And soon, no clothes.

601
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,882
You just can't keep your
hands off me, can you?

602
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:32,302
When I can I ever?

603
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,224
Fuck dinner, I always wanted to
do it

604
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:42,602
on the mattress on the floor.

605
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:44,939
Yeah, mattress on the floor is
very fun.

606
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,317
- I hate you.
- Prove it.

607
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:20,264
I'm really not feeling too
well.

608
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:22,350
Is there still nothing from the
ambulance?

609
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:23,728
What's taking them so long?

610
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:29,859
Hi. What's his name again?

611
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,694
What's your name again?

612
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:36,741
Mark, and I'm in need of an
ambulance.

613
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:39,283
What sort of fucking
games are we playing here?

614
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:41,160
What's the matter with you
people?

615
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,662
I don't care if you live in
Timbuktu,

616
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:44,832
ambulances don't take this long
to arrive.

617
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:49,085
Oh my god.

618
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:52,004
Has he been this much
fun this entire time?

619
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,965
No wonder you guys

620
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,843
wanted to keep him all for
yourselves.

621
00:34:56,928 --> 00:35:00,390
Oh, I'm all excited.

622
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:06,396
All right Mark, are you even
listening?

623
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:19,907
Let me break
this down into simple terms.

624
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:24,620
You really picked the wrong
fucking family to rob tonight.

625
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,539
The ambulance.

626
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,791
Their aint no ambulance coming

627
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,168
you fucking idiot.

628
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,461
What do you mean there's
no ambulance coming?

629
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,839
What are you talking about?

630
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,257
You called the cops?

631
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,800
They would've taken me to the
hospital-

632
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:40,386
- Oh my god.

633
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:43,598
There's no cops coming,
there's no ambulance coming.

634
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,977
Aint nobody coming Mark.

635
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:48,644
But you called.

636
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:51,022
Actually, I pretended to call.

637
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:55,236
Actually, I didn't call jack
shit.

638
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:59,739
Yeah, not very smart,
that's what I thought.

639
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:02,325
You know what? I wanted to bet
on it.

640
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:03,326
But I didn't.

641
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:05,369
You know that feeling when
you just know something

642
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:06,871
but you don't say it?

643
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:09,540
Like you think, oh, what if I'm
wrong?

644
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,667
I don't want to look stupid.

645
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:14,337
But then every time you didn't
say it,

646
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,422
ah, maybe not every time

647
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,092
but it feels like every time.

648
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:21,552
I'll just say it, every time.

649
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:24,555
You were right, you were fucking
right.

650
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:25,640
You want to tell your friends,

651
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:26,849
I knew this was gonna happen

652
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:27,892
but I just didn't say it.

653
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:30,855
Yup, I get that all the time.

654
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:33,189
Like for me, usually it's when

655
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,190
I'm watching a movie, right?

656
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,442
Like, you just know what like,
a character's gonna say next

657
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,110
like everything just lines up
for like,

658
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:41,405
you're sure of it.

659
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:44,867
Sometimes it's these like,
corny lines or whatever

660
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:45,826
but sometimes it's actually
things

661
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,328
that are pretty hard to guess.

662
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,913
And you don't say it.

663
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:52,458
You think, shit, if I say it

664
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,710
at the exact same time as the
character,

665
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:57,465
everyone in the room is
gonna be so impressed.

666
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,758
But you stop yourself, oh.

667
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,593
And then sure enough, the
character says

668
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:05,930
the exact line you thought
he or she was gonna say.

669
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:08,933
And then you turn to
your friends

670
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:11,936
and you're like I
knew he was gonna say that

671
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:16,440
and they go like, yeah,
okay.

672
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:19,360
Most annoying thing ever, right?

673
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,114
What the fuck are you talking
about?

674
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:25,410
Huh, what am I talking about?

675
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:30,162
No ambulances are
coming, no cops are coming.

676
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:32,123
So what, you guys are
just gonna let me go?

677
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:34,083
I don't know Mark, I don't
know yet.

678
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,668
Depends on you actually.

679
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,087
But if you don't let me go,
then what?

680
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,925
I'm pretty sure you can draw
your own conclusions Mark.

681
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,801
What is this? Is this some
sort of joke?

682
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:46,470
I wish this was a
joke

683
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:48,514
but this is serious.

684
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:51,892
As serious as an HIV test,

685
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:53,811
that's how serious this is.

686
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,773
That shit is serious.

687
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,818
Let me go you fucking psychos.

688
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:05,533
Aw Mark, she just wants
to talk to you okay?

689
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:09,618
I promise I won't let her hurt
you

690
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,328
unless you deserve it, okay?

691
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,789
Don't fucking touch me.

692
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,625
You're fucking crazy. All
of you are fucking crazy.

693
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:19,712
Let me go, let me go! Let me go!

694
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:24,425
Stop calling me crazy, Mark.

695
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,971
I don't like people calling me
crazy.

696
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:32,935
I won't touch you, but just
stop calling me that okay?

697
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:39,025
I asked you a fucking question,
okay?

698
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:40,860
Okay.

699
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:44,195
All right Ashley, we get it.

700
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:45,531
Stop swinging your dick.

701
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:51,412
I said I would talk to him so
let's talk.

702
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:55,581
So you guys are not
gonna let me go are you?

703
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,667
I told you Mark, I don't know
yet.

704
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,211
We can't just let you get back
out there

705
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:01,837
if you're gonna talk to people
about us.

706
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,422
Talk about what?

707
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,965
I don't even know who you guys
are.

708
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:08,469
Mmm, I think you know too much
already.

709
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,179
And why would I talk
about the house I broke into

710
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,681
and got my ass kicked by a
little kid?

711
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:13,849
Who you calling a
kid?

712
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,976
And woke up tied to a
chair on some S&M shit,

713
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:18,312
why the fuck would I want to
talk to anyone about that?

714
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:21,190
- That's what I said.
- No one asked you Ashley.

715
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:24,235
Your role in this story is
to be the pretty girl, okay?

716
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:26,570
So play the part.

717
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:27,406
Bitch.

718
00:39:29,242 --> 00:39:30,783
Are they always like
this?

719
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:33,869
Actually, this is a good day.

720
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,413
All right, can we
focus for a minute here?

721
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:39,124
Happy you two are getting
along so well, that's great.

722
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:40,626
Look, he's not a bad kid.

723
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:43,963
He just got mixed up in a bad
situation.

724
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:46,841
True, except for the whole
raping your daughter and shit.

725
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:47,675
Great guy.

726
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:48,968
I wasn't trying to rape you.

727
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,095
When are you gonna get
that in your fucking head?

728
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,721
You guys better let me go this
time.

729
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,473
You better let me go,
you better let me go!

730
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:55,268
Let me go!

731
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:57,977
So that's how
you want to do this?

732
00:39:57,979 --> 00:39:59,730
Help! Anyone, help!

733
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,525
All right Ashley, shut him up.

734
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:08,863
- What? Seriously?
- Before I change my mind.

735
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:10,656
I'm killing
him though, right?

736
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,658
No, no, wait, wait, who said
anything

737
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,703
about killing anyone?

738
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,024
All right, what did you bring?

739
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,277
I promise I'll be quiet, I
swear.

740
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,153
Just please don't hurt me.

741
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:51,032
Are you sure you'll be quiet?

742
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,032
Like Ashley just went through

743
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:55,117
- the entire-
- Yes, I promise.

744
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,369
Silence of the lambs, I swear.

745
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:59,622
Ashley, hold that thought
okay?

746
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:00,456
But mom.

747
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,832
Ashley.

748
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,005
I think I have an idea.

749
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,924
Oh, do tell.

750
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:11,844
Would Mark happen to be a
father?

751
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:16,972
Actually, Mark would
happen to be a father.

752
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,307
He's got a cute little kid.

753
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:23,395
In fact, that's why he breaks
into houses on Christmas

754
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:25,940
daddy dearest.

755
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:28,859
I told you, I've never done
this before.

756
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,694
My back's against the wall.

757
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:31,904
What would you do if you
couldn't afford

758
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,697
to buy your daughter a meal?

759
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:34,531
Let her die?

760
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:37,159
Mmm, shit happens.

761
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,661
Kids die every day.

762
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:40,454
People die, so what?

763
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,414
Now Grace, that's enough.

764
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:45,876
Even in this situation, you
can't keep your shit together?

765
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:49,171
I mean, what did she
ever do that was so bad?

766
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,423
Do we really have to do this
now?

767
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:54,551
Yes, we really do have to do
this now.

768
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:56,261
You seem to want to do it now

769
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:58,389
which means I have to do it now.

770
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:01,433
I mean, I don't care if we
have the fucking pope over

771
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:05,396
for dinner, you don't talk
about our daughter that way.

772
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:09,068
Our daughter. Right.

773
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:13,114
Perfect little Ashley.

774
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:21,745
Just, what was that idea you
mentioned

775
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:22,707
a little while ago?

776
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,292
Mark, what does your son look
like?

777
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:28,127
Actually, there's a picture
down there.

778
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:29,547
Hmm, honey would you mind?

779
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:33,134
I have to do everything around
here.

780
00:42:34,844 --> 00:42:36,677
Why do you want a picture of
my son?

781
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,262
Simple, Mark.

782
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:40,014
Here's how this will play out.

783
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:42,057
Listen closely, because
this is your only chance

784
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,434
to get out of this.

785
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:46,895
I'll try to say it as clearly as
I can.

786
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,439
Oh, wait, by the way

787
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:50,401
are you a righty or a lefty?

788
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:52,278
Right.

789
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:55,571
I will untie your right hand.

790
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,906
In your hand, I will place a
pencil.

791
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,950
Under that pencil will be
a small piece of paper.

792
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:03,037
On that piece of paper, you
will write the following.

793
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,621
Your son's Christian name

794
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:07,416
followed by his family
name, in that order.

795
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,959
Underneath that, you will write
down

796
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:11,295
his social security number.

797
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:13,299
Wait, how old is your kid?

798
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:15,676
He's six.

799
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:19,094
Okay, then he has one for
sure.

800
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:21,889
Just that before 1986, some
parents could sometimes

801
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:23,974
have kids well above
the age of 14 years old

802
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:26,685
and not get them their
social security numbers.

803
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:28,937
But at the end of 1985,
they stopped all that.

804
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:30,731
Now you can't basically
go above like five,

805
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,107
without registering your kids.

806
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,943
Hmm, the more you know.

807
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:38,739
Anyway, we will need that
number.

808
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:40,741
Underneath that number,
we will need the name

809
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,910
of his school, then under that

810
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:44,620
we'll need his date of birth

811
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:47,790
and then the city and
hospital in which he was born.

812
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:49,249
Wait, why should I give
you all this information

813
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:50,542
about my son?

814
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:52,252
What keeps me from telling
you both to fuck off

815
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:54,546
and I aint giving y'all shit?

816
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:55,800
That's a good question.

817
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:58,260
Here's an idea.

818
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:02,515
Supposing he doesn't tell us.

819
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,308
We've got enough to find him.

820
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:09,436
So we bring them both to the
basement,

821
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:12,523
we kill the little
bastard in front of him,

822
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:14,691
we leave the kid to rot

823
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:17,820
and then we keep him
alive by force feeding him

824
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:21,323
until there's nothing left but
rot.

825
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,828
And then we kill him.

826
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:26,662
I just thought about that.

827
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,163
I mean, can we just do that?

828
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:28,999
No.

829
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:32,795
Is that enough? It's good for
me.

830
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:37,214
What are you guys
gonna do with all that?

831
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,551
Simple, Mark.

832
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:40,634
If we let you go, we need to
know

833
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,970
that you're not gonna go blab
about us.

834
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:46,390
About us living here, about
you coming to this house.

835
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:49,768
We need you to forget Mark.

836
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,812
Forget that we exist.

837
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,897
We need to become more
than distant memories,

838
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:57,234
we need to fade completely
away from your mind.

839
00:44:57,236 --> 00:45:00,279
Because if we ever let you go,
Mark

840
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:03,909
if you ever leave this
house still breathing,

841
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:09,413
and you ever so much as dream of
us,

842
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:12,001
you won't like what happens
next.

843
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:17,590
Ashley probably will, but you
won't.

844
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,802
We can't be
talking about this shit.

845
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:26,847
Still haven't answered
the question Chris.

846
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:30,559
I mean, are we a couple? Are we
together?

847
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:31,435
Yes or no.

848
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:32,686
Or are you just fucking me?

849
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:34,855
That doesn't have to
do with any of this.

850
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:37,274
Keeping secrets from
me, Chris?

851
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:39,610
What else are you hiding from
me?

852
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:41,653
What? Are you cheating on me?

853
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:43,322
You can tell me. I already know.

854
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:45,034
Seriously, just tell me it's
fine.

855
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:47,701
I know what you're
trying to do here Ashley.

856
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:50,037
It's not gonna work this
time. I'm telling you.

857
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:52,581
I knew it, I fucking knew
you were cheating on me.

858
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:55,125
Who is it? That little
whore slut Stephanie?

859
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:56,501
I saw the way that you were
looking at her

860
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:57,878
at the party last weekend.

861
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,755
Stacy said, "No, he wouldn't do
that."

862
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,048
But I knew you were fucking

863
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:03,634
- cheating anyways.
- Okay, okay, okay, fine.

864
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:04,511
You win, okay?

865
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:07,306
You gave it a good fight,
babe.

866
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:17,981
Now talk to me, lay it on me
papi.

867
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:20,859
Okay, but I didn't sleep
with anyone else though, okay?

868
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:23,111
Duh.

869
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:24,404
What? Do you think I'm stupid?

870
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:25,906
Or are you stupid?

871
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:28,118
I'm just messing with you,
geeze.

872
00:46:29,078 --> 00:46:31,703
Come closer, I don't want
to talk about this shit

873
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:33,038
in the open, okay?

874
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,375
There aint
nobody in this joint.

875
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:37,378
All right.

876
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:40,504
Yes, I did.

877
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:43,131
But just once okay?

878
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:45,050
Now, can we please change the
topic?

879
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:48,971
No we can't change
the topic motherfucker.

880
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:49,805
Please quiet down.

881
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:53,517
All right, all right,
fine you little pussy.

882
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:55,686
But you did it, whatever.

883
00:46:55,688 --> 00:46:56,853
Not a big deal.

884
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:58,397
Not a big deal?

885
00:46:58,399 --> 00:47:00,484
You're clearly not all there
then Ashley.

886
00:47:02,111 --> 00:47:03,902
I'm not the one who
just confessed to murder

887
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:06,446
in a fucking public place.

888
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:07,366
Wow.

889
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:11,537
So, who was it?

890
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:14,371
- Can we talk in-
- Chris, come on.

891
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:16,873
This is called communication.

892
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:19,626
That's what a relationship's
all about, right?

893
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:21,628
Hold up, who told you about
this?

894
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:24,339
I've never even talked
about it with anyone.

895
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:27,092
A good reporter never
reveals her sources.

896
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:29,094
You aint even a fucking
reporter though.

897
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:32,347
Whatever, I
aint snitching on the plug.

898
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:34,182
A little birdy told me, okay.

899
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:35,811
It was Steve wasn't
it?

900
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:37,894
It was.

901
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:39,438
Maybe.

902
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,772
I fucking knew it, that piece
of shit.

903
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:43,734
You know, I never even
really told him about it.

904
00:47:43,736 --> 00:47:44,693
I didn't deny it either, but I
mean.

905
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:49,573
Mhmm, you know, you look good

906
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:51,950
but you're not very smart.

907
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:52,786
What?

908
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,749
So, who was it?

909
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:02,002
My dad.

910
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:04,338
You killed your fucking dad?

911
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,964
He was scum.

912
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:07,299
He bit the shit out of me and my
sister.

913
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:08,717
You know, he didn't even care
about us.

914
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:12,429
You know, you could beat me all
you want.

915
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:13,638
I can take that.

916
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,058
But don't touch my fucking
sister.

917
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,059
Fuck.

918
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:18,560
Yeah, fuck.

919
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:19,646
So how'd you do it?

920
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:23,023
I didn't do it on purpose.

921
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:27,444
But this one time he
was beating on my sister

922
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:30,280
and I never actually physically
stepped in

923
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:32,115
but this time, I don't
know what got into me,

924
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:33,617
maybe I was like, tweaking or
some shit

925
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:37,412
but I just, I pushed
him as hard as I could.

926
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,247
And my dad, he was a
big motherfucker, okay,

927
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:40,999
he was like, a big guy.

928
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:42,626
And I pushed him as hard as I
could

929
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:45,921
and I punched him and he just
dropped

930
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:46,797
straight to the ground.

931
00:48:46,799 --> 00:48:49,257
Gone, like just, gone.

932
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,259
And my sister tried to
wake him up and shit

933
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:55,682
but he was dead.

934
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,601
Shit.

935
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:00,977
Yeah, shit.

936
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:03,146
So how'd you get away with it?

937
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:05,649
It was actually my sister,
she was trying to protect me.

938
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:08,527
You know, at the time,
I honestly didn't care

939
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:11,905
if I got arrested or
not, or even got caught.

940
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:14,950
But my sister, she was upset
yeah,

941
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:17,661
that my dad was dead,
but she didn't want me

942
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:19,121
to go to jail either.

943
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:21,875
So she was like, yeah he's dead

944
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:27,462
but he was also an alcoholic
and beat us and abused us.

945
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:31,091
So we dragged his body to the
bathtub,

946
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:34,012
we sat him in it, ran some warm
water

947
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,264
and framed it as if he
fell and hit his head

948
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:38,100
in the bathtub.

949
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:40,725
And it was actually pretty funny

950
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:41,601
'cause we brought him to the
hospital

951
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:44,062
a few months before for
the same god damn thing.

952
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:46,940
- What? No you didn't.
- Yeah, we did.

953
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,483
And then we called the police.

954
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:49,609
And that shit flew?

955
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:51,822
Well, I'm sitting here aren't
I?

956
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,656
I want you to kill my mom.

957
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:55,826
What?

958
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:57,617
What what?

959
00:49:57,619 --> 00:49:59,619
What do you mean what what?

960
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:00,704
You just asked me to kill your
mom.

961
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:01,913
You can't what what me.

962
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:02,831
Can you do it or no?

963
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:06,418
You're fucking with me aren't
you?

964
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,545
What's so hard about killing
my mom?

965
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,547
You killed your dad, my
mom should be easier.

966
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:12,674
Fuck you Ashley, that's
not the point here.

967
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:14,593
What, you think I'm a
fucking hit man or some shit?

968
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:15,719
No, I'm not killing your mother.

969
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:17,888
Oh come on, I'd do it myself

970
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:20,265
but if I did, my dad would
know for sure it was me.

971
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:22,767
Forget it Ashley, I aint doing
it.

972
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:25,854
Well, I don't know
what to tell you Chris.

973
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,856
So what are you gonna do then?

974
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:28,982
Pay someone else to do it.

975
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:30,484
What do you mean pay someone
else?

976
00:50:30,486 --> 00:50:32,027
You were gonna pay me to do it?

977
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:33,570
50 bands.

978
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:34,821
$50,000?

979
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:37,866
Aw, you thought just
because you're fucking me

980
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,618
I wouldn't compensate you?

981
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,786
Where the fuck did you get
$50,000?

982
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:45,499
Let's just call it my
trust fund, college money.

983
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:47,792
I aint going, so who the fuck
cares?

984
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:50,003
And you have access to that
shit?

985
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:52,966
I aint just have access.

986
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:57,304
I have it.

987
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,432
Fuck, you're just
walking around with this?

988
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:03,808
Who's gonna fuck with me?

989
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,143
Is this real?

990
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:06,021
Last I checked.

991
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:08,897
You're insane.

992
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:11,358
And now you're repeating
yourself.

993
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:14,945
Chris, really, it's not that
complicated.

994
00:51:14,947 --> 00:51:18,865
You just wait for her outside,
pull up,

995
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,994
shoot, pow.

996
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:26,039
And dip, wait in your car,

997
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:28,375
something discrete, I don't
know.

998
00:51:28,377 --> 00:51:29,709
As long as you peel off

999
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:31,711
and they can't connect it back
to me,

1000
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:33,505
can't connect it back to you.

1001
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:36,258
And I could do it however?

1002
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,676
So you're gonna do it?

1003
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:39,886
I mean, speaking
hypothetically.

1004
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,263
Well yeah, no.

1005
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:44,599
The less I know the
better, for the both of us.

1006
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:46,268
I don't know if that's
a good plan Ashley.

1007
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:48,186
I mean, I got away with it once.

1008
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:50,355
You think I can get away with it
again?

1009
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:52,566
Chris, we don't need a plan.

1010
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:55,402
Like, besides my dad,
nobody knows I hate her

1011
00:51:55,404 --> 00:51:57,779
and there aint no money
coming to me if she dies

1012
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:59,866
so why would the police think
it's me?

1013
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:03,618
And this could go down
whenever?

1014
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:06,371
Well, not next fucking year

1015
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:07,664
but yeah, whenever.

1016
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:09,708
I don't know, I don't care.

1017
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:13,295
Like, one in three murders
goes completely unsolved

1018
00:52:13,297 --> 00:52:17,090
in this country, no obvious
connections.

1019
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:19,718
You really think they're
gonna figure it out?

1020
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:24,097
Do you know how dumb the cops
are in this town?

1021
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:26,683
But you know we're
talking about murder, right?

1022
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:29,477
Like, we're talking about your
mom's life.

1023
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:31,898
We're talking my life here.

1024
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:36,568
Like, fuck though, you can't
come on me.

1025
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,612
You want me to come on you?

1026
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:39,654
If I had known you were this
crazy-

1027
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:41,533
- What? You would've fucked me
harder?

1028
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:45,619
Forget it, you're not even
taking this shit seriously.

1029
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:47,495
Find someone else.

1030
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:48,373
Chris.

1031
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:07,893
So we doing this?

1032
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:10,646
Or are you gonna keep pump
faking?

1033
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:22,864
Double, triple, quadruple
check

1034
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:24,783
everything on there.

1035
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:29,164
If as little as a dot on an
I is missing from something

1036
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:35,835
Grace is gonna stick your head
up your ass

1037
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:39,007
faster than a rabbit gets
fucked.

1038
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:42,425
Especially considering
I'm going to check

1039
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:43,343
on the little man right now.

1040
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:45,345
You wanna go right now?

1041
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:47,389
I mean, I don't know about
leaving him alone that long.

1042
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,640
It's fine, I can go alone.

1043
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,266
You aint going alone Grace.

1044
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:52,852
I mean, this has set
up written all over it.

1045
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:54,270
You walk in that joint,

1046
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:56,398
the next thing you know,
little man's lighting you up

1047
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,899
his god damn self.

1048
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,901
Fourth of July in December.

1049
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:00,819
Then you come with me

1050
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:02,406
and Ashley can keep him company.

1051
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:05,615
I don't know about leaving her
with him.

1052
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:07,283
Thomas, she'll be fine.

1053
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:09,577
Plus, she needs to start
pulling her weight around here.

1054
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:11,079
The man is tied up.

1055
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,163
Just like, tie his other arm

1056
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:14,668
and make sure he's not going
anywhere, she'll be fine.

1057
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:18,294
It's fine
dad, really. She's right.

1058
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:20,797
You sure? You
don't have to do this.

1059
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,799
- Whatever.
- I swear dad.

1060
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,262
And if anything, I'll just
call y'all on the car phone.

1061
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:27,139
Promise.

1062
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,033
We'll be back as soon as we
can.

1063
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:50,368
I would've gone and done this
alone

1064
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:53,037
- but what with-
- But yes, this is my plan

1065
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:55,331
and if you want something done
right.

1066
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:15,393
Aha, little birdy want to
play, huh?

1067
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:31,951
Come on, let's go.

1068
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:49,656
Hey Mark, can I ask you a
question?

1069
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:52,409
Not really, no.

1070
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:57,495
What was your relationship
like with your mom?

1071
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:59,040
What is this? The Oprah show?

1072
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:02,836
I'm sorry, but my mind
is elsewhere right now.

1073
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:05,255
Okay.

1074
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:09,342
What if I were to let you go?

1075
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:12,929
What's your mindset like now?

1076
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:15,847
Let me go?

1077
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:16,683
Mhmm.

1078
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,269
And why would you do that?

1079
00:57:21,313 --> 00:57:22,105
I'm tired.

1080
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:25,732
I'm tired.

1081
00:57:25,734 --> 00:57:27,025
You're tired?

1082
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:28,445
Yeah, I'm tired.

1083
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:32,198
I'm tired of all of it,
I'm tired of everything.

1084
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,533
I really don't think
you're gonna go to the cops

1085
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:37,829
and if you do, whatever.

1086
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:40,538
We're all gonna get what's
coming to us anyways

1087
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:41,583
including you.

1088
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:45,712
So yeah, I'm tired.

1089
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:49,714
I mean, what? You want to
stay here and get killed?

1090
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:50,759
I mean, I don't mind.

1091
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:53,051
What do you want?

1092
00:57:53,053 --> 00:57:54,636
Okay, first of all,

1093
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:56,346
can you at least try and be
nice?

1094
00:57:56,348 --> 00:57:57,513
I mean, I'm being nice here.

1095
00:57:57,515 --> 00:58:00,350
You got me tied up to
a chair all fucked up.

1096
00:58:00,352 --> 00:58:01,726
How is that nice to you?

1097
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:02,602
You're the one who broke in
here.

1098
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:04,562
And you were the one that
was about to come down here

1099
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:06,981
and torture me about 20 minutes
ago.

1100
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:07,817
Oh yeah.

1101
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:11,569
Oh and by the way, full
disclosure.

1102
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:12,862
I'm the one that stabbed you.

1103
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:14,948
- What?
- What?

1104
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:17,951
What did you think that this
was some sort of plot twist?

1105
00:58:17,953 --> 00:58:20,747
Some conspiracy about how you
got stabbed?

1106
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:24,040
Nope, you were out

1107
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:28,544
and I was bored, so I stuck this
in you.

1108
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:30,588
You're fucking sick.

1109
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,217
Okay, let's just call it even.

1110
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:36,594
And how is this even close to
even?

1111
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:39,140
Enough with all the questions,
Mark.

1112
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:42,225
I stabbed you, I fucking stabbed
you

1113
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:43,645
and that's payback.

1114
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:48,441
So you want to get out of here
or no?

1115
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:53,279
So play nice and tell me about
your mom.

1116
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:56,280
She was all right.

1117
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:57,782
What do you mean, all right?

1118
00:58:57,784 --> 00:59:00,868
I don't know, she was a normal
mother.

1119
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,745
I don't know what you
expect me to tell you.

1120
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:05,289
The truth, that's it.

1121
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:07,000
Unless you want to wait
for my parents to come back

1122
00:59:07,002 --> 00:59:09,170
'cause that's happening real
soon.

1123
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:12,714
Ashamed.

1124
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:14,090
Ashamed?

1125
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:16,175
Bitch please, whatchu mean I'm
ashamed fo?

1126
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:17,012
No.

1127
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:19,973
My mom.

1128
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:24,267
That was the first thing
that came to my mind

1129
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:25,353
when I thought of her.

1130
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:29,733
Ashamed of me.

1131
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:33,403
Now we're talking.

1132
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:35,530
Whatchu mean?

1133
00:59:37,866 --> 00:59:39,242
My mom raised me alone.

1134
00:59:41,036 --> 00:59:42,746
She did her best, she really
did.

1135
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:45,999
I never got what you had.

1136
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:48,750
In the projects working two jobs

1137
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:50,251
just to keep the lights on

1138
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:52,213
and me running the streets at
her back.

1139
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:55,216
Know that rap song?

1140
00:59:56,885 --> 00:59:59,218
Just this one doesn't
have me drinking champaign

1141
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:00,055
when I'm thirsty.

1142
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:03,266
Nice B.I.G reference.

1143
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:06,227
I don't know.

1144
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:10,106
I know all this shit sounds like
a cliche

1145
01:00:11,483 --> 01:00:12,982
but that's the one thing about
cliches,

1146
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:14,611
they're often close to the
truth.

1147
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:18,406
It took me a long time to
understand.

1148
01:00:20,492 --> 01:00:22,243
Took me a long time just to get
it.

1149
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:27,205
Like to understand where she
got that motivation from,

1150
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:29,959
where she got all that energy
to do everything she did.

1151
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:35,381
And it was all for me.

1152
01:00:36,508 --> 01:00:38,299
And still to this day,
I haven't even been able

1153
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:39,302
to thank her for it.

1154
01:00:40,845 --> 01:00:43,348
All she ever wanted for
me was something better.

1155
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:47,477
For me to be a better person.

1156
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:51,231
Fast forward, now I aint shit.

1157
01:00:53,233 --> 01:00:55,316
And even if you were to
compare the two of us,

1158
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:56,277
I'm even less.

1159
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:00,031
So yeah.

1160
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:03,576
Where is she now?

1161
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:06,871
Not sure.

1162
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:10,750
She could be gone, I don't know.

1163
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:15,964
But if she could see me now,
shame.

1164
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:20,508
That's what she'd feel for me

1165
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,470
and that's already more than I
deserve.

1166
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:28,933
I wish I had a mom who cared
that much.

1167
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:34,814
Are you serious right now?

1168
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:36,357
Yeah, I'm fucking serious.

1169
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:37,525
Do you see the way she talks to
me?

1170
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:39,068
And that's on a good day.

1171
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:40,444
This is a good day?

1172
01:01:40,446 --> 01:01:41,614
I've seen worse.

1173
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:45,783
Wow, whatever.

1174
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:46,909
You're really gonna buy this
whole act

1175
01:01:46,911 --> 01:01:47,743
your mom's putting on?

1176
01:01:47,745 --> 01:01:50,663
It's not an act, it's true,
trust me.

1177
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:51,624
It's bullshit.

1178
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:54,709
Are you really gonna buy this
whole

1179
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:56,711
I hate my daughter act?

1180
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,921
Yeah I buy it, 'cause it's
fucking true.

1181
01:01:58,923 --> 01:01:59,966
It's bullshit.

1182
01:02:01,009 --> 01:02:02,300
If you weren't so focused on
yourself

1183
01:02:02,302 --> 01:02:03,136
you'd see it too.

1184
01:02:04,304 --> 01:02:05,680
Enlighten me then.

1185
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:11,934
I just think if parents
didn't care about their kids

1186
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:13,188
they just wouldn't care.

1187
01:02:14,647 --> 01:02:16,522
And if your mom really did hate
you

1188
01:02:16,524 --> 01:02:19,027
she wouldn't be riding you
this hard all the time.

1189
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:22,780
Some people just don't
know how to show it.

1190
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:26,157
You think you had a fucked up
life?

1191
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:27,283
Did you ever think for once

1192
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:28,784
maybe your mom had it worse

1193
01:02:28,786 --> 01:02:31,289
and maybe that's the reason
why she is who she is?

1194
01:02:32,957 --> 01:02:36,626
Like I said, some people
don't know how to show it

1195
01:02:36,628 --> 01:02:38,588
but it doesn't mean they don't
feel it.

1196
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:43,009
And like that, I think you
two have that in common.

1197
01:02:44,344 --> 01:02:45,178
Just saying.

1198
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,147
Who is it?

1199
01:02:58,149 --> 01:03:01,025
Good evening,
I just wanted to warn you

1200
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:04,028
that you and your husband
are going to die tonight.

1201
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:07,823
It's kinda tragic, but there's
nothing you can do about it.

1202
01:03:07,825 --> 01:03:08,993
We will kill you.

1203
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:14,413
You have about 30 seconds
before the fun starts.

1204
01:03:14,415 --> 01:03:15,665
We thought we'd give you a heads
up

1205
01:03:15,667 --> 01:03:18,292
because we like to play fair.

1206
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:20,129
- Grace?
- So grab a knife,

1207
01:03:21,005 --> 01:03:22,255
or a baseball bat

1208
01:03:22,257 --> 01:03:25,466
or whatever makeshift weapon you
can find

1209
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:29,681
and just so you know,
there's also a very bad man

1210
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:33,057
- waiting at the back door.
- Grace what's up?

1211
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:33,891
- Who is it?
- Thomas listen.

1212
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:35,351
Please, we need to run.

1213
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:36,310
No, what's going on Grace?

1214
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:37,728
She said she was gonna kill
us.

1215
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:40,606
What are you talking about?

1216
01:07:01,601 --> 01:07:03,603
They gave me a simple
choice.

1217
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:08,483
Either kill my mom or
they'll kill us both.

1218
01:07:10,067 --> 01:07:11,360
I was 10 years old.

1219
01:07:12,653 --> 01:07:14,570
When they saw me hesitating,

1220
01:07:14,572 --> 01:07:16,447
they told me what happened to my
father.

1221
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:17,533
She killed your dad, she shot
him.

1222
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:21,160
That they weren't
the one that killed him.

1223
01:07:21,162 --> 01:07:22,411
That my mom...

1224
01:07:22,413 --> 01:07:24,663
Oh my god, don't do
this.

1225
01:07:24,665 --> 01:07:25,831
Strong.

1226
01:07:35,259 --> 01:07:36,884
I love you so much-

1227
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:46,687
So you expect
me to believe this shit?

1228
01:07:47,688 --> 01:07:48,896
They shot your dad

1229
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:51,734
and then you got adopted by
your real parent's killers?

1230
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:55,653
You might be fucked, but
you'd be even more fucked

1231
01:07:55,655 --> 01:07:57,571
if that actually happened.

1232
01:07:57,573 --> 01:07:59,156
I guess it's too
early for you to realize

1233
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:01,075
how actually fucked I am.

1234
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:04,245
I mean, did you listen
to anything I just said.

1235
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:07,414
If you really look at it, they
didn't actually kill anybody.

1236
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:08,251
This time.

1237
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:12,002
My real mom and I did all the
work.

1238
01:08:12,004 --> 01:08:13,379
It's not that
fucking easy to kill people

1239
01:08:13,381 --> 01:08:15,506
and take their identities.

1240
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:18,801
Like, what happened to the
bodies?

1241
01:08:18,803 --> 01:08:20,803
Did these people not
have family or friends?

1242
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:22,012
People leave paper trails.

1243
01:08:22,014 --> 01:08:24,640
Other people ask questions.

1244
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:26,602
They knew what they were
fucking doing.

1245
01:08:28,145 --> 01:08:29,395
They chose people they thought

1246
01:08:29,397 --> 01:08:30,773
wouldn't be missed too much.

1247
01:08:32,316 --> 01:08:33,607
The real Thomas and the real
Grace

1248
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:34,984
grew up in foster homes.

1249
01:08:34,986 --> 01:08:38,153
And after I shot my mom,
they burned the bodies

1250
01:08:38,155 --> 01:08:40,866
and here we are.

1251
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:44,994
Anyways, I don't really give a
fuck

1252
01:08:44,996 --> 01:08:46,453
if you believe me or not.

1253
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:48,414
A deal's a deal, right?

1254
01:08:48,416 --> 01:08:49,331
What are you doing?

1255
01:08:49,333 --> 01:08:51,375
Think I'm a liar?

1256
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:53,752
They're probably on
their way back here now.

1257
01:08:53,754 --> 01:08:55,129
If I were you, I'd get your son

1258
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:56,839
and I'd get the hell out of
state.

1259
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:58,426
Or even better, out of country.

1260
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:01,844
Okay, can I have my wallet
back please?

1261
01:09:01,846 --> 01:09:03,472
I think it's under the chair.

1262
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:06,392
Sure.

1263
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:23,616
What are you doing?

1264
01:09:23,618 --> 01:09:24,952
Can you undo these please?

1265
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:30,581
You know there's a few
things you can't finesse

1266
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:31,542
a teenager on.

1267
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:35,254
You can fool us about a lot of
things.

1268
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:39,006
But there's a few things a
teenage girl

1269
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:43,304
knows more about than almost
anyone.

1270
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:50,603
You know what those things are?

1271
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:53,773
Fake ID's.

1272
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:59,610
David Cook, Joey Montichollo,

1273
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:01,155
Jocyln Gardnell.

1274
01:10:09,413 --> 01:10:11,082
Do you even know who this kid
is?

1275
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:19,546
Maybe trust a murderer

1276
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:21,968
but never trust a thief.

1277
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:58,337
What are you doing?

1278
01:10:59,171 --> 01:11:00,003
Please!

1279
01:11:00,005 --> 01:11:00,838
Please, please, please,
please, please, please, please.

1280
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,548
I promise, please, please,
please

1281
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:04,383
I'm so sorry, please, please.

1282
01:11:04,385 --> 01:11:06,135
Told you I
don't like fucking liars.

1283
01:11:06,137 --> 01:11:07,636
Please, please, please,
please, please.

1284
01:11:13,477 --> 01:11:15,602
You were so close, Mark.

1285
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:19,150
So fucking close you
could probably taste it.

1286
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:22,027
I'd feel bad for you

1287
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:25,656
but I see a good side to this.

1288
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:30,119
We can finally have some fun.

1289
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:33,871
Please.

1290
01:11:33,873 --> 01:11:35,332
You really are a pussy.

1291
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:43,130
So tell me, if the whole
son story was all bullshit

1292
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:45,340
then why'd you break in here?

1293
01:11:45,342 --> 01:11:46,258
Drugs.

1294
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:48,177
Speak up bitch.

1295
01:11:48,179 --> 01:11:49,678
Drugs.

1296
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:50,512
To pay for drugs.

1297
01:11:50,514 --> 01:11:52,806
All right, we're done talking
now.

1298
01:11:52,808 --> 01:11:56,103
Well, you're done talking now.

1299
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:00,983
I'ma do whatever the fuck I damn
want.

1300
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:04,070
I have an idea.

1301
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:07,198
I think you're gonna like it
Mark.

1302
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:10,616
Where are you going?

1303
01:12:10,618 --> 01:12:14,371
Where are you going?

1304
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:19,627
Mark, did you just
choke on your own blood?

1305
01:12:28,135 --> 01:12:30,636
I'ma save this for later.

1306
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:19,770
What?

1307
01:13:21,105 --> 01:13:23,564
What? What was that?

1308
01:13:23,566 --> 01:13:24,900
I can't hear you, what?

1309
01:13:27,528 --> 01:13:30,865
Oh, you made me really mad,
Mark.

1310
01:13:33,367 --> 01:13:38,203
Oh yeah, that's not even your
actual name.

1311
01:13:38,205 --> 01:13:42,207
It's okay, I'll
keep calling you that

1312
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:43,752
if you don't mind.

1313
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:47,673
It's funny.

1314
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:52,928
I don't even know your real name
and yet

1315
01:13:54,597 --> 01:13:56,348
I still feel kinda close to you.

1316
01:13:59,184 --> 01:14:01,896
Funny how we use names

1317
01:14:03,188 --> 01:14:05,024
to describe things.

1318
01:14:06,483 --> 01:14:11,028
When really, those names have
nothing

1319
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:12,239
to do with those things.

1320
01:14:15,034 --> 01:14:15,868
For example.

1321
01:14:19,204 --> 01:14:21,373
You obviously know this
is a hammer, right?

1322
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:26,418
But the part of the hammer
that I used to hit you

1323
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:29,254
is called the face of the
hammer.

1324
01:14:29,256 --> 01:14:32,633
And I hit you in the face.

1325
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:37,598
What? I still can't hear you
Mark.

1326
01:14:39,767 --> 01:14:41,936
I wish I could, but I can't.

1327
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:45,771
Anyways, what was I saying?

1328
01:14:45,773 --> 01:14:49,524
Oh yes, the face of the hammer.

1329
01:14:49,526 --> 01:14:51,195
So this is the face,

1330
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:54,238
let's go a little deeper.

1331
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:55,989
Do you know what this part is
called?

1332
01:14:58,369 --> 01:15:02,331
Mark, you're not even trying to
play.

1333
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:07,209
I'm really disappointed in
your lack of participation.

1334
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:08,545
It's called the cheek.

1335
01:15:12,716 --> 01:15:15,219
No one can hear you Mark.

1336
01:15:16,136 --> 01:15:21,264
Sound is really isolated
here, kinda freaky.

1337
01:15:21,266 --> 01:15:25,310
Look, I'll even scream with you,
okay?

1338
01:15:25,312 --> 01:15:26,897
Help, help! Somebody please
help!

1339
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:31,485
Hmm, yeah.

1340
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:43,622
Nobody's coming Mark.

1341
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:46,333
Now where was I?

1342
01:15:48,919 --> 01:15:50,627
Oh yeah, the cheek.

1343
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:18,490
Oh shit, fun's over.

1344
01:16:30,753 --> 01:16:33,128
What the fuck happened in my
house?

1345
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:35,505
We gotta clean this shit up
and quick.

1346
01:16:35,507 --> 01:16:38,383
This is getting messy,
real fucking sloppy.

1347
01:16:38,385 --> 01:16:40,260
Thomas, we are not
killing him in my house.

1348
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:41,263
We live here.

1349
01:16:42,222 --> 01:16:43,555
I thought we were done with all
this

1350
01:16:43,557 --> 01:16:45,724
and now it's starting all over
again.

1351
01:16:45,726 --> 01:16:47,350
Thomas, untie him, we need to
get him

1352
01:16:47,352 --> 01:16:48,769
into the car right now.

1353
01:16:48,771 --> 01:16:50,937
- The sun is coming up.
- Okay.

1354
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:52,731
Dragging a
bloody man from your house

1355
01:16:52,733 --> 01:16:54,107
into your car isn't the most
discrete thing in the world.

1356
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:55,817
We need to get rid of him quick.

1357
01:16:55,819 --> 01:16:56,693
I'll put on my
jacket.

1358
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:57,778
Ashley, you're not coming.

1359
01:16:57,780 --> 01:17:00,363
You've enough for one night,
we'll talk in the morning.

1360
01:17:00,365 --> 01:17:02,282
Mom, please, you might need my
help.

1361
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:03,658
We're just gonna take him to
the lake,

1362
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:06,411
do what we gotta do, nothing
we haven't done before.

1363
01:17:06,413 --> 01:17:07,748
We'll be fine.

1364
01:17:11,085 --> 01:17:12,417
Thomas, I'm gonna get the car
ready.

1365
01:17:12,419 --> 01:17:15,128
Mom, can I just talk
to you for second please?

1366
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:17,339
I'm sorry I didn't tell
you that he was lying.

1367
01:17:17,341 --> 01:17:18,924
You should have called us.

1368
01:17:18,926 --> 01:17:19,925
We're in a rush, but listen.

1369
01:17:19,927 --> 01:17:21,051
It could've been a trap,
instead you do this

1370
01:17:21,053 --> 01:17:23,553
and now we're cleaning up your
mess again.

1371
01:17:23,555 --> 01:17:24,429
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

1372
01:17:24,431 --> 01:17:27,432
Look Ash, we have to do this
now.

1373
01:17:27,434 --> 01:17:30,771
But if you want, we can talk
as soon as I come back, okay?

1374
01:17:49,957 --> 01:17:52,124
You better not have any stupid
ideas

1375
01:17:52,126 --> 01:17:54,042
going through your head.

1376
01:17:54,044 --> 01:17:57,629
When we get outside, you
so much as look at someone

1377
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:59,965
the wrong way, I will slice your
ear,

1378
01:17:59,967 --> 01:18:02,261
oh for fucks sake.

1379
01:18:03,554 --> 01:18:06,473
What the fuck is it now? For
god's sake.

1380
01:18:08,058 --> 01:18:08,892
For fucks sake you ugly
motherfucker,

1381
01:18:11,311 --> 01:18:14,022
get the fuck up, the fuck
is wrong with.

1382
01:19:46,865 --> 01:19:47,697
Go!

1383
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:57,209
Stay here.

1384
01:20:08,262 --> 01:20:11,098
Merry Christmas you mother
fucker.
