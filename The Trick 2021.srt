00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,400
LAUGHTER

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,480
Wait.  There we go.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,120
WOMAN LAUGHS

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,920
Nellie, careful there.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,320
Sorry, Grandad.

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,120
Ready?  That's ready.

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,080
OK.  Ready, Nellie?

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,760
Here I come!

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,040
Aa-a-ah!  Aa-a-ah!

12
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,720
Run!

13
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,000
Aargh! Aargh!

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,920
I can't believe you're
still doing that.

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,240
Whee!

16
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,760
I'd like to welcome you to this
international

17
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,680
conference for climate change, 2009.

18
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,720
It is my great pleasure to
welcome our keynote speaker,

19
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,920
who has been a pioneer in climate
science for the last 30 years,

20
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,000
an expert in his field,

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,080
world-renowned,

22
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,800
and who will address us on his work
on the global instrumental

23
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,880
temperature record, often referred
to as a hockey stick graph,

24
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,960
which has been
so important in helping us

25
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,520
to understand the cause of change
during the last 1,000 years.

26
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,160
We are honoured to welcome
Prof Philip Jones.

27
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,880
Go on, then.

28
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,120
APPLAUSE

29
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,480
Thank you.

30
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,640
Thank you very much.

31
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,160
PLUCKED VIOLIN MUSIC

32
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,280
I'll call you to let you know
when I'm back.

33
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,680
You're a star, Dad, thanks.

34
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,560
Where the hell are you?
The train leaves in two minutes.

35
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,040
Shit.

36
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,520
Sorry.
I had to sort out the kids.  Right...

37
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,920
Let's see what level of a shit
storm we've got here.

38
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,640
The University of East Anglia's
Climategate email controversy.

39
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,360
Climategate.  Climategate.

40
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,880
The Climategate scandal.

41
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,280
Scientists are using words like
"trick".

42
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,120
Climategate they're calling it,

43
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,920
a new scandal over global warming
and it's burning up the Internet.

44
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,680
Have the
books been cooked on climate change?

45
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,640
At worst it's junk science

46
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,000
and it is a part of a massive,
international, scientific fraud.

47
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,440
It's a communications consultancy.

48
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,000
Crisis management.

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,720
Neil Wallis,
ex-editor of a Sunday tabloid

50
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,560
and his colleague Sam Bowen.

51
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,160
Sam's background is more corporate
public relations.

52
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,960
Can we trust them?

53
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,800
I think we have to.

54
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,000
We're running out of time.

55
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,160
They're accusing him of fraud, Ruth.

56
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,200
How is Phil?

57
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,120
You haven't seen a select
committee hearing?

58
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,360
No.

59
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,520
It's no walk in the park.

60
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,480
Eight people right
there in front of you

61
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,120
and trying to put you on a skewer.

62
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,600
Right.

63
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,640
It's the House of Commons,
the government.

64
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,640
An all-out vindication
and this Professor Philip Jones

65
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,800
and the rest of them
have got half a chance.

66
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,280
The slightest whiff of a rap across
the knuckles and they're screwed.

67
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,920
So we've got one shot at it?

68
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,400
To clear their names?

69
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,600
And three weeks to do it.

70
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,920
Skulduggery,
scientific espionage and black
propaganda.

71
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,680
Have scientists really been
manipulating the data?

72
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,240
They claim to be victims of a crime,
right?  They are.

73
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,760
From the off everyone is all over
their arses like they're
the criminals.

74
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,280
Even the tree huggers,
the environment correspondents.

75
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,280
We need institutions independent
of them declaring their innocence.

76
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,240
I suppose they don't know, do they?

77
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,560
What?

78
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,520
If they are innocent or if Jones did
rig the data

79
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,600
to exaggerate the increase
in temperatures?

80
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,080
Exactly,

81
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,400
everyone is terrified
they're guilty as charged.

82
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,040
Maybe they're right to be.

83
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,200
..tonight faces forensic
examination.

84
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,600
The temperature graphs at the heart
of concern of about climate change

85
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,800
will now be picked
over by experts.

86
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,360
Edward Acton, Vice-Chancellor.

87
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,880
Neil Wallis. Sam Bowen.

88
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,720
Pleased to meet you.  This is my
co-Vice-Chancellor, Trevor Davies.

89
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,400
Trevor.  Former director
of the Climatic Research Unit,

90
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,240
also known as CRU.

91
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,320
Three months ago.

92
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,360
When you were hacked?

93
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,480
No.

94
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,120
The hacking itself was some
months before.

95
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,560
We only became aware of it
when the hacker uploaded the file.

96
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,640
What was he called again?
Realclimate.org.

97
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,920
The university learned about it
the following day.

98
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,760
And you, Phil.

99
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,360
Is that when you found out?

100
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,080
I...

101
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,200
Yes, that's when we found out too.

102
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,920
And what was your response once you
knew there'd been a hack?

103
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,800
We informed the police
and told them

104
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,840
there had been an IT system
breach.  A data theft.

105
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,480
I think
that's the phrase that was used.

106
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,240
Goodnight.

107
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,480
Goodnight.

108
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,920
Thank you, Stella.

109
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,760
You're very welcome.

110
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,760
These are the press office documents

111
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,760
and I've had made this for you -
it's the broadcast coverage.

112
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,360
Good.

113
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,240
We'll take a look at that tonight.

114
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,200
Isn't it rather late?

115
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,200
The House of Commons hearing,
it's in three weeks, right?

116
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,800
Yes.

117
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,560
The clock is ticking, Edward, so
yeah, we'll be working tonight.

118
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,440
I see, good.

119
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,720
Good.

120
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,080
Jesus, they weren't joking.

121
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,440
He's broken.

122
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,560
Yep.

123
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,720
Do you think he...?

124
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,440
He did it?

125
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,960
You'd expect him to be a bit more
pissed off, wouldn't you?

126
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,480
If he was innocent.

127
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,600
Are you sure I'm the right person
for this?

128
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,040
I do corporate.

129
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,760
Branding.

130
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,720
Which means you're not digital.

131
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,800
Look, whatever.

132
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,080
We're here now, aren't we?

133
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,600
Getting paid to get this lot
out of a hole,

134
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,240
guilty or not.

135
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,280
SEAT BELT CLICKS

136
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,200
CAR ENGINE STARTS

137
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,080
OK, thanks for coming, everyone.

138
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,680
Thank you.

139
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,080
Er, let's start with the headlines.

140
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,840
Two days ago the Safer
Neighbourhoods team logged

141
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,280
a data theft from a backup
server

142
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,840
at the University's Climatic
Research Unit, known as crew.

143
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,560
Safer Neighbourhoods flagged
the call to Special Branch

144
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,360
and last night Gold Command,
on my recommendation,

145
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,600
initiated Operation Cabin
as a major investigation.

146
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,600
The contents of the file
appears to be

147
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,560
around 1,000 emails

148
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,360
and other documents written over a
ten-year period by staff at CRU,

149
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,240
mostly by its current director,
Professor Philip Jones,

150
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,360
world-renowned climate
scientist.

151
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,200
Gareth here is from Kinetic,

152
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,160
a defence contractor
specialising in cyber security.

153
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,360
His team will lead on the digital
investigation,

154
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,200
reporting directly to me as senior
investigating officer.

155
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,840
The other two lines of inquiry,

156
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,320
physical breach of CRU or an
internal leak,

157
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,800
will be overseen by Gold group.

158
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,320
This is a Category A investigation,

159
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,880
so we can hopefully expect some
additional support

160
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,920
from national
counterterrorism Scotland Yard.

161
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,360
Yes.

162
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,600
The Cat A status,

163
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,840
sorry, boss, but who's been
murdered?

164
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,960
No-one, DS Suppiah.

165
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,400
So the only crime that we're
invest...

166
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,600
The breach of the
Computer Misuse Act, section one,

167
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,880
and, depending what we turn up,
maybe section two.

168
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,160
Regardless, this is still
a Cat A investigation,

169
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:17,400
and I would appreciate it
if it were treated as such.

170
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,680
Right, if there aren't any more
questions, you know the drill.

171
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,000
Any pissed-off employees, office
politics, financial vulnerability...

172
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,640
..who had access,
what was the IT set-up,

173
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,960
any hint of a motivation,
I want to hear about it.

174
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,880
Thank you.

175
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,800
DS Suppiah, a word.

176
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,520
I appreciate this might just be
a staff member with an axe to

177
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,040
grind, or some hacker winning
a pissing contest,

178
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,520
but if it isn't, look at
the timing, join the dots.

179
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,560
Three weeks before COP15,
the UN Climate Conference.

180
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,120
Think about it, if this
is someone trying to influence

181
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,440
the global response to
climate change,

182
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,320
well, then, I'd say maybe
Cat A isn't high enough.

183
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,880
CAMERA CLICKS

184
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,800
The stolen emails are mostly
conversations between colleagues,

185
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,800
climate scientists,
here and in the US.

186
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,840
And these conversations,
they've been taken wholesale?

187
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,760
No, because whoever
compiled this file,

188
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,560
they knew what
they were looking for.

189
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,440
These emails had been selected,

190
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,800
probably using a word
search for certain phrases.

191
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,480
The first place a link is
posted along with this comment here,

192
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,640
"a miracle has happened",
is climateaudit.org.

193
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:17,360
It's a climate sceptic blog run
by this man, Steve McIntyre.

194
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,040
He's receiving the link,
he's not...? He's not sending it?

195
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,120
Yeah,
but he's got history with Jones.

196
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,280
Erm, McIntyre is a Canadian
ex-mining consultant turned...

197
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,440
..self-appointed climate
science fact checker.

198
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,840
If you look at his blog posts

199
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,400
and the comment streams
of his website, and the emails,

200
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,720
it reveals that there is an
established relationship with Jones.

201
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,480
And it seems as far back as 2002,
he's been asking Jones for his data.

202
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,240
Which Jones gave him?

203
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,400
Yeah. Initially.

204
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,840
But then, McIntyre started using it
to criticise Jones,

205
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,320
to undermine his career,
Jones backed off.

206
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,680
McIntyre, well, he got frustrated.

207
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,880
Earlier this year, he persuaded
his entire database to send

208
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,640
freedom of information requests to
CRU, asking for their raw data.

209
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,880
Which they did.  Yeah.

210
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,120
Jones was flooded,
and I mean flooded, with requests.

211
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,800
60 in one week, look.
It's a bloody tsunami.

212
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,680
Annoying, but not illegal.

213
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,760
Yes, but that's where it gets
interesting.

214
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,720
Our initial analysis of the hard
drives and servers suggests

215
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,880
that the unit was hacked several
times between that same time period.

216
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,640
Are you saying there was more than
one breach?  Not only that.

217
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,840
McIntyre's requests were formally
refused by the university.

218
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:41,280
And four days later, a file
of stolen materials goes live.

219
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,280
I have not falsified any data!

220
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,200
Collusion?

221
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,920
They can't argue with the facts.
That's what they do all the time!

222
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,520
Do you really think this is them?

223
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,760
Well, of course it's them!

224
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,400
I'm sorry.

225
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,360
I haven't done anything wrong, Ruth.

226
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,680
Are you suggesting that
McIntyre was responsible?  No.

227
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,680
It was a relatively
sophisticated attack,

228
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,680
he wouldn't have the capability.
But there was a coordination.

229
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,480
More likely someone else
with a vested

230
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,240
interest in tracking his disputes
with CRU.

231
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,000
Yeah, you should also speak to
this guy. This is Steve Mosher.

232
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,640
He's an established lukewarmer.

233
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,600
He doesn't believe that
climate change

234
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,320
is as serious as everyone's
making out.

235
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,600
When the emails came out,
he was in charge of finding

236
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,080
the extracts before they were
taken down.

237
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,760
"I've just completed Mike's nature
trick..."

238
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,600
"..to hide the decline."

239
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,280
"Cheers, Phil."

240
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,600
And these are the
extracts that are penetrating now?

241
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,360
Yeah. It's a
very effective selection.

242
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,040
Mosher knew exactly what
he was doing.

243
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,000
Have your comms team got Phil's
comment on why

244
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,440
he used the word trick?

245
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,400
Already on the website, along with
an acknowledgement of the hack.

246
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,880
Look, I think we should do more -
defend the science.

247
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,160
We'd be inviting an attack.

248
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,320
I'm telling you,
there's an established history.

249
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,680
It's a bunch of bloggers, Trevor.

250
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,840
Just let them burn the story
out amongst themselves.

251
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,120
There was a piece in the Guardian,
and surely, it's quite...

252
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,040
Our defence would only raise more
questions, give the story oxygen.

253
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,960
We don't want the science
questioned, either.  Look...

254
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,440
..if we can get through the weekend
without The Today Programme

255
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,560
calling us, I really think
we'll be fine, OK?

256
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,520
25 to eight.

257
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,040
Those who are on the sceptic side
have seized on these emails.

258
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,480
One of those sceptics is
Lord Lawson, the former Chancellor,

259
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,480
whose book, An Appeal To Reason...

260
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,040
On the face of it, it looks as
if the raw data were being

261
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,200
manipulated in order to prove what
they wanted to prove,

262
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:29,920
that they were refusing to allow
other scientists outside

263
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,080
access to the raw data, that they

264
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:36,320
were talking about destroying
various files in order to prevent

265
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,480
data being revealed through
the Freedom of Information Act.

266
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,880
Now, these are very,
very serious things.

267
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,440
It may be that there is an innocent
explanation for all this,

268
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,760
but what is absolutely clear,

269
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,080
because this is the basis on which
policy decisions are being made,

270
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,840
to some extent, by the government,

271
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,640
and by governments around the world,
it has also tarnished very

272
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,800
badly the international
reputation of British science.

273
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,640
They'll need...

274
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,400
It's just, we really need some
clarity, especially on why

275
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,480
some of the temperature data
can't be released to the public.

276
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,480
Shell.

277
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,440
"Dear Phil Jones -
you should kill yourself.

278
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,200
"You lying prick, arsehole.

279
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,400
"And if you don't, I'll be more than
happy to do it for you.

280
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,120
"And your family."
Oh, God. That's terrible.

281
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,680
We'll inform the police.

282
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,040
Look, Ruth, if he does come round
a bit, would you mind...

283
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,680
He's the only one who knows
the truth about the emails,

284
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,520
the temperature...
I know, believe me, I know.

285
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,960
Even his voice has changed, Trevor.

286
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,320
Like it's stuck in his throat.

287
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,680
Are you and Grandad coming
to my school play, Granny?

288
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,600
Of course, sweetheart.

289
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,240
Did...
It might just be Granny this time.

290
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,320
OK.  OK!

291
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,560
Bye.  Bye.

292
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,240
Bye, Granny, see you soon. Bye!

293
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,200
RUTH SOBS

294
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,480
These are the most damaging
extracts.

295
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,480
Can you delete any emails
you may have had with Keith?

296
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,680
Keith will do likewise.

297
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,840
"We're choosing the periods
to show warming.

298
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,000
"I've just completed Mike's
nature trick...

299
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,040
"..to hide the decline."

300
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,280
The press inquiries haven't stopped
all morning, it's unprecedented.

301
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,680
Like nothing anyone's seen before.
And from the US now to...

302
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,920
What is it they want,
specifically?  Phil.

303
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,160
The extracts are mostly
from his emails.

304
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,600
And he's the director of CRU.

305
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,680
They want to know why all of CRU's
data isn't available as well.

306
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,640
But in terms of people, Phil.
No-one else.

307
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,800
I'm afraid that's not going
to be possible.

308
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,320
Well, surely you don't stand by his
comments on the website?  Yeah.

309
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,040
Why isn't Phil available?

310
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,680
It would be the clearest way to
set things straight.  I agree.

311
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,040
I went round there this morning
after the Lawson interview.

312
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,480
The man's struggling.

313
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,600
30 years ago, do you remember,

314
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,840
you had that offer of work
in California?

315
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,200
And we came here to talk about it,
about the kids moving school.

316
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,320
What it would all mean.

317
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,960
And you got so excited.

318
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,840
Not about going, but about staying.

319
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,120
About what that meant.

320
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,600
Do you remember?

321
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,600
Philip, if I can remember,
I know you do.

322
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,040
"It's going to be important,"
that's what you said.

323
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,520
Politicians were just starting to
talk about global warming,

324
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,920
and you said that when
they finally came to act on it,

325
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,320
they'd needed data they could trust.

326
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,040
They'd need evidence,
and that you, CRU, would be

327
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,160
able to give it to them.

328
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,160
Well, that time is now, Philip.

329
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,000
And you were right.

330
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,480
They do need your evidence.

331
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,240
Which is why we can't let these
bastards destroy all you've done.

332
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,280
It's too important.

333
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,240
You're too important.

334
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,040
"I've found what I can do, Ruth."

335
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,280
That's what you said.

336
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,240
"And the place I can do it."

337
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,920
God,
and I so wanted to go to California!

338
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,960
Did you?  Yeah! RUTH LAUGHS

339
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,320
You're going to have to speak up,
Philip.

340
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,280
We'll issue a press statement with
Phil's comment from the website.

341
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,040
And let's see if he'll do a press
Association interview, at least.

342
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,600
Just print, no TV.

343
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,040
Let's announce an independent
inquiry into the allegations

344
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,760
and into the actions of our staff.

345
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,320
If there has been malpractice,

346
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,080
we must show we're
keen as mustard to investigate.

347
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,840
And we need support, too.

348
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,920
Public support.

349
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:41,040
Thanks, Chris. Any help in releasing
the data is hugely appreciated.

350
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,280
We were wondering if your department
could give a statement to...

351
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,440
I'll see what I can do.  We really
need help on this one, Chris.

352
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,400
Trevor, sorry, look, I've got to go.

353
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,680
Sir David, have you
seen the CRU fallout?

354
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,200
Christ, haven't I?

355
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,520
What the bloody
hell were they thinking about?

356
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,800
I mean, I wouldn't accept such loose
practices from my students.

357
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,640
Well, siege mentality.
I mean, the deniers have had him

358
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,960
in their sights for as long
as I can remember.  That is...

359
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,720
..precisely when
you have to be careful,

360
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,080
when you think you're in a battle.

361
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,120
I mean, not to put
the data in the public domain.

362
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,480
Well, to be fair, Sir David, it
isn't theirs to give.

363
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,880
What do you mean?

364
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,280
Well, CRU built its models on data
from meteorological services.

365
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,160
And sometimes, that data
comes with nondisclosure agreements.

366
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,400
Sir David King, School of Enterprise
and the Environment,

367
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,160
Oxford University.

368
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,560
Thanks very much.

369
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,600
I've been on the
phone all morning to the Met Office,

370
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,400
putting pressure on them to give
clearance to release all the data.

371
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,640
And?  Not yet.

372
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,640
Any news about the hack?

373
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,000
Nothing I've heard. Any thoughts?

374
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,520
Well, take your pick.

375
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,800
Could be the Russians, the Saudis,
the oil companies,

376
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,320
anybody who's got money in the game.
But you know, it's clever,

377
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,200
going after the data
behind the modelling.

378
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,160
I don't understand why everyone

379
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,120
expects science models to be
perfect.

380
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,560
I mean, no-one ever goes after
economic models, do they?

381
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,920
No, that's because nobody's
trying to undermine the economics.

382
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,560
LIFT BELL PINGS

383
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,600
Do you really think it will affect
the COP in Copenhagen?

384
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,760
Well, it might
scare the horses a bit,

385
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,840
but no, this COP is
dead in the water anyway.

386
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,720
You really think so?  Come on, Chris.

387
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,120
I mean, the USA are not going to
sign up to their commitment

388
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,880
to carbon reductions
unless it's voluntary, and

389
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,880
if they won't sign, then neither
will the Chinese or the Russians.

390
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,800
Look, do what you can about getting
the Met to release that data.

391
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,320
It could douse the flames.

392
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,240
Now, the head of a British climate
research institute has

393
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,680
stepped aside after leaked emails
were said to suggest that the

394
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,680
case for global warming had
been exaggerated.

395
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,640
Phil Jones, at the University
of East Anglia, will relinquish

396
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,320
his duties while an
independent review is carried out.

397
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,920
Our environment correspondent,
David Shukman...

398
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,600
There are more stolen emails.  No,
I...  I'm saying there's a lot more.

399
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,120
Almost 200,000 in total.
Shit! 200...?

400
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,840
So, the really odd thing, that
they left the cache on the server.

401
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,360
Which is almost like they, well...

402
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,280
I guess it's almost like they wanted
us to know.  What are you saying?

403
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,560
Well, it means that CRU wasn't

404
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,240
the only climate unit
that was attacked.

405
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,080
There were more hacks?  Attempts.

406
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,040
CRU was the only
successful breach.

407
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,800
What were the other attempts?

408
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,360
OK, so, persons unknown posing
as network technicians tried to

409
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,120
gain access to climate science
offices at the University

410
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,120
of Victoria, British Columbia.

411
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,800
And there were attempts to access
the servers at the Canadian

412
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,880
Centre for Climatology and
Analysis, the National Center

413
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,680
of Atmospheric Research in
Colorado,

414
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,600
and an attempted unauthorised entry

415
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,000
to the computer systems at the
State Department Climate Bureau.

416
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,240
And when, when was all this?
This is all in the last 12 months.

417
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,000
You do know he's the victim?

418
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,640
It's his emails that were stolen.

419
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,240
It's him that's being dragged
through the papers.

420
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,040
Why aren't you going after
who did this?

421
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,720
I realise this must be upsetting.
No-one's getting the truth.

422
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,400
Just what they read, what they hear.

423
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,240
Where are you going?  Just
down to the station.  We just...  Why?

424
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,840
We need to print the statement
and have it signed immediately.

425
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,120
Well, use our bloody printer!
Ruth, it's fine.

426
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,200
We'll be 30 minutes, I promise.

427
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,640
This hockey stick graph,
the one that you

428
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,200
mention in the interview, why is it
so important exactly?

429
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,480
Well, it's...

430
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,360
It's a reconstruction
of global temperature, a...

431
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:35,680
..a window into the past,
I suppose, back 1,000 years.

432
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,040
All these are decades here.

433
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,480
That is the handle of the stick.

434
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,440
And here, in the 19th century,
when industrialisation takes off,

435
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,040
erm, up until now, that's the...

436
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:05,560
..erm, that's the blade, when
temperatures increase dramatically.

437
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:09,920
This is your work?
Well, I contributed.

438
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:13,320
CRU was the first unit
to be dedicated to the

439
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,200
subject of climate change.

440
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,600
We devoted more time than
anyone else to...

441
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,320
..to, erm...gather
the temperature data.

442
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,640
It's not just from across the world,
but from across time.

443
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,360
Wow.

444
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,800
From before we had thermometer
readings, erm...

445
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,640
..historical, erm, records,
ships' logs.

446
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,720
And then even further back, er,
proxy data, such as tree rings

447
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,240
and ice cores.  I saw the tree
rings on the walls of your office.

448
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,000
They're beautiful.

449
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,520
Well, we... Erm...

450
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,000
..all of that, the proxy and
historical data goes into the graph.

451
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,440
That's... It, erm...

452
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,240
..helps make the past...

453
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,520
..readable.

454
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,000
Best get you home, yeah.

455
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,160
Thank you.

456
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,880
Who's doing this, Trevor?  Who knows?

457
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,160
Plenty of vested interests
would like Copenhagen to fail.

458
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,240
I know why they're doing it to us,
though.

459
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,040
The hockey stick graph.
Yes...?

460
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,640
The one showing the rise in global
temperatures?

461
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,400
Yeah, CRU's work has been
keystone to that graph.

462
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,520
I mean, it was meant to be
the final word in the debate.

463
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,520
The science behind it is complex,

464
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:48,800
though the way it conveys it is
simple, it cuts through the noise.

465
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,040
That's what the sceptics don't like.

466
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,920
Ever since it was published,
they've known, if they're to keep

467
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:58,080
the debate going, they have to cast
doubt on the hockey stick.

468
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,520
Crafty buggers.

469
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,480
Sorry. That was a long one.

470
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,520
Must have done
over 20 interviews now.

471
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,320
It's like speaking into a storm.

472
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,200
No-one can hear us.

473
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,000
Or wants to.

474
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,080
We're being drowned
out by a sigh of relief.

475
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,360
Relief?

476
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,200
Well, imagine if you woke up
tomorrow to be told you don't

477
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,040
have to worry about climate change.

478
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,800
Millions of dollars have
gone into the denial campaigns.

479
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,720
And most of it to achieve
exactly this,

480
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,920
to make the science seem uncertain.

481
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,760
It's been going on for years,

482
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,360
ever since we first started
talking about actually doing

483
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,720
something about global warming.
Which was when, exactly?

484
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,720
Oh, late '80s.  So those campaigns...

485
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,960
..essentially, they bought
themselves time with those millions.

486
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,080
They've had decades to prepare
a receptive environment.

487
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,160
Whoever hacked into us...

488
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:59,760
All they had to do was release those
emails in the right places

489
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,720
and sit back and watch.

490
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,880
They've had 20 years to
prepare for this. We've had days.

491
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,680
We need crisis management advice.

492
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:13,360
It's a straight choice.
Duck it or fight it.

493
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,920
But how do we fight it if the
world wants Phil and the data

494
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,000
and we can't provide either.

495
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,840
OK, well, if Phil can't do
the interviews, then you have to.

496
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,440
What about the independent inquiry?

497
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,920
No-one gets hacked for the sake
of it. There's always intent.

498
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,640
The UN Climate Conference, the COP,
it opens next week, right?

499
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,320
Yes.  So, it's a strategy.

500
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,840
Someone's decided to take
positive action to...

501
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,800
We don't actually know if that's
the case.  Nothing's a coincidence.

502
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,720
Sow doubt where there's certainty,

503
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,120
apply a minor inconsistency to
the entire evidence, discredit

504
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:54,480
a group of people, muddy the debate,
all to achieve policy outcry.

505
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,600
It's hardly new.

506
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,920
Straight out of the tobacco
companies' playbook

507
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:02,440
when they were stalling for time
on cigarettes and cancer.  Mm.

508
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,440
Other interest groups have used
the same strategies around

509
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,000
pesticides, the ozone hole,
acid rain.

510
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,080
It's not like we haven't seen
these tactics before.  No.

511
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,440
Never with the internet. The blocks.

512
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,280
Yeah, that IS new. I'll admit
there's no playbook for that.

513
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,880
Look...

514
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,680
This isn't going to be easy.

515
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:36,400
For a start, you're a...white,
middle-aged, posh man.  Hm.

516
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,520
It's going to be hard for you to go
on TV and come across as likeable.

517
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,400
Yes...

518
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,800
Yes, I see.

519
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,960
It's your only choice.

520
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,480
Do nothing now...

521
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,840
..that's as good as being guilty.

522
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,840
Now, it's hard to believe that some
emails written on a university

523
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,480
campus in Norwich could be
quite so damaging.

524
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,880
Today, Saudi Arabia's chief climate
change negotiator, no less,

525
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,600
said the leaked emails
from scientists at the Climate

526
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,080
Research Unit at the University
of East Anglia will have a huge

527
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,560
impact on next week's Copenhagen
summit, even as it's...

528
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,400
You shouldn't be watching that.
Why not? It's what I've done.

529
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,040
That's not true.

530
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,920
They've finally found a way
to get me, Ruth.

531
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,000
And they'll, well...

532
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,560
..pull at this thread
until it all unravels!

533
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,000
They've won, Ruth.  No. They haven't!

534
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,480
They know the truth is out
there now.

535
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:07,600
So all they can do is try to
find ways of delaying how soon it

536
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,840
reaches everyone.

537
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:13,200
That's not the actions of people
who've won. Philip,

538
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,560
that's the desperation of people
who've lost.

539
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,520
You're forgetting something.

540
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,400
What?

541
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:30,400
Not everyone wants the truth
to reach them.

542
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,840
So, what do you think?
I think they're screwed.

543
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,720
The blogs I get and the American
right wing networks,

544
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,200
but the mainstream
media following their lead...

545
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,240
The BBC, for Christ's sake!

546
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:34,800
Which is why we need to get him
out there.  Phil?

547
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,880
We need to put a human face on this,
before the House of Commons hearing.

548
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,960
Get the public back on our side.
He could barely talk.

549
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,240
Which is why it has to be print.

550
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,680
No TV.

551
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,400
You're serious?
We'll have to coach him.

552
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,600
Sunday Times, front page.
Do you think they'll take it?

553
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,040
They'll love it!

554
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,000
It's what they've been baying for,
isn't it?

555
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,680
The man at the heart of it.

556
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,320
Edward tried his best,
but no-one wanted to know.

557
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,480
So we throw them to the lions.

558
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,880
With a couple of lion
tamers in the room.

559
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,760
But yeah, if it means we're the
ones feeding them for a bit.

560
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,640
That's exactly what we do.

561
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,120
No time for anything else.

562
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,520
Not with that House of Commons
committee breathing down our necks.

563
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,000
We'll coach him here. Today.

564
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,160
Are you sure this is the right...?
I'm positive.

565
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:36,360
Unless you want to cut him loose.
Out of the question.

566
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,920
Well, I had to check.

567
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,920
Because if it's the reputation
of the university you're trying

568
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,480
to save...  It isn't.

569
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:53,560
It isn't?  Well, yes, it is,
but that's no longer the priority.

570
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,680
This is about more than
the university now.

571
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,520
Much more.  The science?

572
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,160
The truth.
Right.  That's what's at stake here.

573
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,880
And who gets to tell the truth,

574
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,640
or not,

575
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,440
about something that affects every
living thing on the planet.

576
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,800
Mea culpa. That's what you open
with, before anything else.

577
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,000
I'll brief the journalists to
ask about the data stuff first,

578
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,680
the Freedom of Information request.
When he does, you put your hands up.

579
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,760
Admit you got it wrong...  But those
requests, they weren't genuine.

580
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,760
Yes, we know...
The data was already...

581
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,520
But admitting that you got
frustrated,

582
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,160
you could have handled it better,
that's very relatable.  Yeah.

583
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,800
Getting pissed off with a bunch
of timewasters who want to prove

584
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,720
you wrong, there's no shame in that.
No data was destroyed.

585
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,360
And that's exactly what you'll say,

586
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,000
after you've acknowledged what you
could have done better.

587
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,480
You say it then and people will
listen. It'll sound true.

588
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,680
It is true.

589
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,720
But I need to believe you
when you say it is.

590
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,520
That's all that matters.

591
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,800
Right, so, we take a little
bit of this and pop it in here.

592
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,680
And then, if you take your finger
and poke a nice hole in there.

593
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,840
That's it. And then,
what do you think you do?

594
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,920
Put an acorn in?  Yes. Just the one.

595
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,400
There.  Maybe a little bit more.

596
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:45,560
So, a trick is just a clever
way of doing something.

597
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:49,320
In statistical modelling, yes,
or in maths, a short cut.

598
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:53,320
It still sounds suspect.
A trick of the trade? A technique?

599
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,560
If you like,
a solution to a problem.

600
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,880
But nothing more?  No.  Good.

601
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,400
But then,
we get to hide the decline.

602
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,640
Sent everyone through the roof,
this one, hasn't it?

603
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,200
Sarah Palin, the US networks,
the papers.

604
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,000
What's your defence?

605
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,080
Because it had better be
a bloody good one.

606
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,760
In as few words as possible,
simple and short.

607
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,440
And in a way I'll believe it.

608
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,520
It's about tree rings.

609
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,320
What?

610
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,360
Well, the decline.

611
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,480
It isn't about temperatures.

612
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,920
Go on.

613
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,560
To predict the future, we've got
to understand the past.

614
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,840
Hubert Lamb's...  I'm not interested.
Try again.

615
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,760
Go on, Phil.

616
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,320
Temperature records consist of two
kinds of measurements.

617
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:57,880
From around the mid 19th century, we
have actual instrument recordings...

618
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,200
Try it as a question.

619
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,520
Um...

620
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:08,600
How do we obtain
measurements from further back,

621
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:13,360
from before we have instrument
recordings?  Good! I have no idea.

622
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:17,840
Educate me. How do we?  We use, um,
proxy data...  Sorry, Phil.

623
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:22,360
How else might you explain "proxy"?
What is it?  Um...

624
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,640
The...

625
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,480
The natural world has a memory.

626
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:38,080
It can preserve the physical
characteristics of the past.

627
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:43,000
Past temperatures?  Er, yes.
Um, and weather events.

628
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
What kind of characteristics?

629
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,880
Well, concentrations of oxygen
isotopes in ice.

630
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,400
Or the composition
and annual banding in corals.

631
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,040
Or the... The width and the density
of annual tree ring growth.

632
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,600
Tree rings?

633
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:07,200
Yes, they're wider in a season
of good growth, when it's warmer,

634
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:11,320
and narrower in a season of
restricted growth, when it's colder.

635
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:14,760
So, you add this stuff,
natural characteristics, to the

636
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,800
instrument measurements
and you get a record of temperatures

637
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,480
stretching back in time
before thermometers?

638
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,120
It isn't quite that simple.
Put simply, though, is Neil right?

639
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,040
Well, yes.

640
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,800
So, what's being hidden,
then, in the paper,

641
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,040
you were discussing in that email?

642
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,840
I was writing about one diagram,

643
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:43,560
not a scientific paper.  Phil, split
any more hairs and I'll go bald.

644
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,600
It's OK, Phil.
Just try to answer the question.

645
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,880
What were you hiding?

646
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,960
This is the diagram.

647
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,280
The blue line is the hockey stick,

648
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,800
the red line is my own similar
reconstructions

649
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:20,440
and the green line was produced
by my colleague, Keith Briffa,

650
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,560
using tree ring density data.

651
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:29,480
Keith's data produced similar
results to my own reconstruction,

652
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:34,240
until 1960,
when it began to diverge.

653
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,560
Diverge? What do you mean?

654
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:41,480
Well, the real temperatures
increase sharply after 1960.

655
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:45,840
But the tree rings got narrower,
less dense,

656
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:50,680
as if the temperature was
decreasing, getting colder.

657
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:53,680
Why would they do that?
Well, we're not sure. Um...

658
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,840
Acid rain, or the depletion
in the ozone layer, but whatever

659
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,600
the cause, the tree ring data

660
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,760
becomes unreliable after 1960.

661
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,880
But if it's unreliable then, how do
we know it was any good before?

662
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:12,640
Its match to previous instrument
readings were strong

663
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:17,800
and universal all through the 19th
and 20th century until 1960.

664
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,720
But on the graph,
there's no divergence?  Yes, and...

665
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,560
..I knew that the data became
unreliable,

666
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:31,920
so I included only the real
temperatures in the green line.

667
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,520
To hide the decline.

668
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,880
In tree ring density.
But not the temperature?

669
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,320
Well... There was
no decline in temperature to hide.

670
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,440
Every thermometer in the world
will say the opposite.

671
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,680
The temperatures were rising
all through that period.

672
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,320
And they still are.

673
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,520
Jesus!

674
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,360
They really screwed you over,
didn't they?

675
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,920
Both down?  Flat out.

676
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:03,760
So, how's he doing, your scientist?

677
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,800
Not too great, to be honest.

678
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,040
And who do you think did
this to him?

679
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,600
The hack?

680
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,480
Who knows?

681
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:22,040
But whoever's behind what's happened
since knows their stuff.

682
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:26,080
I mean, a few months ago, there was
consensus on global warming.

683
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,240
Now, headlines across the world.

684
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:33,040
Could have all just happened?

685
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,680
Might not be
anyone behind it at all.

686
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:42,520
Some big players have had plans
for ages. Oil companies, especially.

687
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
They all want to stop the science
getting out there.

688
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:53,120
What's so crazy is they knew
more about it than anyone else.

689
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,800
All through the '80s, they had
the best climate scientists,

690
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:58,960
scenario planners...

691
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,840
And these guys, they're
telling them, the CEOs, the boards,

692
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,680
increasing CO2 in the atmosphere,

693
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:11,400
it's going to be a major
problem for the whole world.

694
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:16,120
Extreme weather, food shortages,
mass migrations...

695
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,640
So what did they do?

696
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,640
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but...

697
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,560
..they took all that,

698
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:34,560
all that knowledge, which they
had more of, in more detail,

699
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,640
and earlier than anyone else, and...

700
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,120
Well, they used it to get
ahead of the curve, to come

701
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:44,560
up with strategies to keep
the public uncertain, unconcerned.

702
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:48,240
What kind of strategies?
Front organisations, mostly.

703
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,080
Produce alternative research that
backed their message

704
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,520
and then pushed it to the media.

705
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,760
Ah, PR then.

706
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,120
Marketing.

707
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,000
Like what you do.

708
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,200
No, Dad.

709
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:05,560
At least with what I do, you
know who's pitching to you.

710
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,200
When I read the projections
about what could happen

711
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,560
if we don't do anything...

712
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,920
..and when I see those dates,
2040 to 2050...

713
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,040
..I can't help thinking how old
the girls will be.

714
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,880
What their lives will be like.

715
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,280
How do you know all this?

716
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,520
There's a paper trail.

717
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,120
If you know where to look.

718
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:36,080
You think it's the oil companies,
then, stole the emails?

719
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,480
Jesus, I don't know, Dad.

720
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,280
It's the internet.

721
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,640
A dark place,
filled with darker places.

722
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,600
I just hope we're doing
the right thing.

723
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,120
Why wouldn't you be?

724
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:55,760
This isn't a flagship store,
some new trainers.

725
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,640
If we get this wrong, it's...

726
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,000
It's game over for him.

727
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:45,960
Give Lily a birthday kiss from me.

728
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,640
Of course.

729
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,240
Um...

730
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:00,520
Um...

731
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,280
I'm...so sorry, Ruth.

732
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,800
You just call me when it's done...

733
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,000
..with that journalist.

734
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,640
SHE SOBS

735
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,320
Oh...God!

736
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,360
Philip!

737
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:07,280
Good morning.  Morning.  Morning.
How are you?  Good. Good. Good.

738
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,800
Are you ready?  Yep.

739
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,520
You're going to be all right.
I'll introduce you to Richard.

740
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,080
Neil!

741
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,200
Thank you, love.

742
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,080
They've done this before, you know.

743
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:29,000
I'm sorry?  Gone after people.
Scientists.

744
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,800
Just for doing their job.
He'll be fine. I promise.

745
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,160
I don't want your promises.

746
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,600
I want to be sure you know what
you're doing.  Yes, we do.

747
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:39,120
I've been in this game
a long time.  But it isn't!

748
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:43,240
Don't you see that? Not to us.
I'm sorry, I...  A game.

749
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,520
That's not what I meant.
That man in there,

750
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,960
the man you're about to let
the press at...  Yeah.

751
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:51,240
..the press who've dragged him
through the mud for months,
he's my husband.

752
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,400
A father, a grandfather, someone
who's tried to spend his whole

753
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,440
life getting closer to the truth.
His work is important.  I...

754
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:02,440
HE is important! So I bloody well
hope you do know what you're doing

755
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:05,560
because this might be just
a job to you, but for us,

756
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:09,320
we could lose everything! Do you
understand? Everything!

757
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,200
Do you have any regrets?

758
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:38,000
Well, I regret that
I didn't deal with

759
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,480
the Freedom of Information
request in a better way.

760
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,440
I... I misjudged the situation.

761
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,320
How, exactly?

762
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,800
Well, um...

763
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:54,600
According to the rules, we're
supposed to do 18 hours of work

764
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:58,400
on each one before we're allowed
to turn it down and, um,

765
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,160
we received 40 over one weekend,

766
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:05,040
all requesting the same
data from five different countries.

767
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,360
We were being targeted.  You think
they wanted to waste your time?

768
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,680
Well, the data was available
elsewhere.

769
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:14,520
They were trying to slow us down,
take us away from our work.

770
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:17,080
And the messages you
sent about deleting the data?

771
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:24,360
Er, well, er... It wasn't
data. It was emails and, um...

772
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,040
Well, that was...

773
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,840
That was... Um...

774
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,080
Er...

775
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,320
Frustration, um...

776
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,160
They were written in anger.

777
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,360
But you did destroy the data?

778
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:46,080
Um, no. It wasn't our data to
destroy. It... We interpret it.

779
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,880
We don't create or collect it.

780
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:52,160
So when the story broke,
this was all just before the

781
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:56,440
UN Climate Conference in Copenhagen,
right?  Yes.

782
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,880
Did that worry you?

783
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,280
That your emails might be
responsible for undermining

784
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:04,320
the talks two months ago?
Yes. Yes, it did.

785
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:07,200
An opportunity the world
cannot afford to miss.

786
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,960
The UN Climate Conference gets
under way in Copenhagen.

787
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,280
The mood music is positive

788
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,360
and thousands of people have
converged on Copenhagen,

789
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:18,720
hoping that some sort of historic
deal might be within reach,

790
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,200
but there are a whole
range of really...

791
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,400
Surely, the CRU emails are going to
undermine the talks, aren't they?

792
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,800
The UN's chief climate scientist
has already said as such.

793
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,720
Look, I'm a member of the UK
negotiating team.

794
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,040
I know how this process works.

795
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:36,920
These negotiators are grown ups.
They know their science.

796
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:40,960
Some fabricated scandal is not going
to affect their opinion.

797
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:44,560
The Saudi negotiator has already
said the emails questions

798
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:46,640
the validity of this conference.

799
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,680
Well, considering he's had breakfast
with a different oil company

800
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:53,040
every morning this week,
I suppose he would, wouldn't he?

801
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:56,120
Look, these talks might fail,

802
00:53:56,120 --> 00:54:00,520
but it's not going to be
because of some stolen emails.

803
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,960
Any thoughts on who might have
stolen the emails?

804
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,920
Well, it seems coordinated, so I...

805
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,880
It could be an intelligence
operation.

806
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:12,000
The file was loaded on a server in
Tomsk. Do you think this was Russia?

807
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,920
Oh, yes, absolutely.

808
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,600
Well, I have seen
first-hand how active

809
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:19,960
they can be in stifling
the science of global warming,

810
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:24,640
but equally, it could also be
the American oil lobby system.

811
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:29,000
After all, they are the main
source of finance behind these
sort of things.

812
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,760
So you really think whoever did this
wasn't trying to derail the talks?

813
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,800
Was it a coincidence that
these emails were released

814
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,720
just before this COP?
Absolutely not!

815
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:44,840
But it's public opinion they're
trying to influence,

816
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,720
not these negotiations.

817
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:50,720
That's what will affect policy,
so no,

818
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,600
this conference is not their target,

819
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:56,160
but it is their stage.

820
00:54:56,160 --> 00:55:01,240
The, um, hockey stick is
shattered beyond repair.

821
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:05,000
And we're talking about it today
because of Climategate.

822
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,360
It's a huge deal.
Don't take my word for it.

823
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:13,120
Just do an internet search
and here's what you find.

824
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:16,240
George Monbiot in the Guardian,

825
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:21,600
"Pretending this is not a real
crisis isn't going to make it

826
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:25,840
"go away.
Phil Jones has got to go."

827
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:30,320
Christopher Brooker,
the UK Telegraph, "This is the worst

828
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:33,920
"scientific scandal
of our generation."

829
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:40,880
The scientists involved in the CRU
controversy violated

830
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:45,480
fundamental ethical principles,
governing taxpayer funded research.

831
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:49,560
And in some cases, may have
violated federal laws.

832
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:52,200
Now, for this reason,

833
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:56,440
I am calling for the following key
players to be investigated

834
00:55:56,440 --> 00:56:01,480
with possible referral to the US
Justice Department for prosecution -

835
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:04,080
Phil Jones, Keith Briffa.

836
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:09,040
CRASHING WAVE

837
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:38,480
And, um...

838
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:42,240
..some of these messages you
received...

839
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:46,480
..were they death threats?  Yes.

840
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,720
And if you don't mind me asking...

841
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,840
..what would they say, exactly?

842
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:00,800
Well, that they knew where I lived.

843
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,280
That...

844
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,560
..I should kill myself.

845
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,160
And if I didn't...

846
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,440
..they'd do it for me.

847
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,360
And did, um...

848
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,640
Did you ever think about that?

849
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,680
About suicide?

850
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,040
Yes.

851
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,920
Several times.

852
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:44,520
And what, um...
I know this is difficult.

853
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,320
But what stopped you?

854
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:01,880
Lily.

855
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:05,360
Lily.

856
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:27,880
CHILD'S LAUGHTER

857
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:46,720
Think, Mrs Jones, somewhere
he goes regularly to, you know, mull

858
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:50,000
over stuff, of to get away from
things?  No. No, not without...

859
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:54,920
Not... Philip? CAR PULLING UP

860
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,760
You... You... SOBBING

861
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,800
All right, all right.

862
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:22,640
All right, I've got you.

863
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,680
I've got you.

864
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:30,560
How did it go?
What did you tell them?

865
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:33,680
Oh, just everything that we
talked about.  Good.  And...

866
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,800
And what, Philip?

867
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:43,680
Well, and, um...

868
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,840
About when I, um...

869
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:52,640
Went... When I didn't, you know,
um...  When's it going out?

870
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:56,480
Tomorrow. Well, I mean, I can...
Nana!  I'm sure they won't use it.

871
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:00,240
Do you want me to call Neil?
I can... I can...

872
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:04,240
Tell him that...  I'm going
to have to warn Matthew.  Why?

873
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,040
Ruth... Why?

874
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:08,760
Because now they'll know you've
got a granddaughter.

875
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:12,240
Those people.
They'll know about Lily.

876
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:17,040
You... You call Neil
and we'll speak later.  Well...

877
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,200
But...

878
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:36,200
You didn't ask them to remove the
suicide stuff?  It's the best bit.

879
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:38,600
Takes the heat off Phil
for a week or two.

880
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:41,040
Puts a face to it. A life.

881
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,360
Reminds people he's a person,
a grandfather.

882
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:46,360
That's what
we need before the hearing.

883
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,640
What about the hack? Who did this?
How did they do it?

884
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:20,600
Why did they do it?
I mean, where are the interviews
with the security

885
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,320
correspondents, cyber experts?

886
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:24,680
Not the story.  Since
when is the crime not the story?

887
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:27,760
When what it achieved is more
interesting.

888
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:30,560
Have you seen these poll
figures from the US,

889
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:33,120
conducted in the months after
the leak went viral?

890
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:38,760
"59% of Americans say scientists
have falsified research data to

891
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:41,120
"support their beliefs
about global warming.

892
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:44,400
"Only 26% take the opposite view."

893
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,280
It's worked, hasn't it?  Yeah.

894
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:53,440
What we need is a proper deflection,
someone to point the finger at.

895
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:57,280
A likely suspect for who did
the hack, or who was behind it.

896
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:02,960
The hacker gave the emails file
names, linked to the date

897
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,920
and time that the email was sent.

898
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:08,240
They must have written a program
to extract the date and time from

899
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:12,880
the text and a tool to convert that
to the number of seconds elapsed.

900
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:15,000
If the times when the email was sent

901
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,120
and the time zone on the computer
the hacker was using to process

902
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:21,960
the emails differed, then the file
name generator will be incorrect.

903
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:26,680
For example, an email
sent from Greenwich Mean Time would

904
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:28,840
give us an error of five hours.

905
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:32,640
Now, this five hour
mismatch could be later,

906
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:37,240
placing the location in this
time zone, Russia and Pakistan,

907
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:41,400
or earlier, in this location,
on the East Coast of America.

908
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:47,160
Now, emails from this time zone
give us an error or zero hours.

909
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:50,440
Indicating that's where the
emails were processed?

910
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:52,040
East Coast of the US?

911
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:55,040
Yes.  Well, that's going to
go down well, isn't it?

912
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:58,840
Now, it is possible that the hacker
reset his computer to avoid

913
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:02,400
detection.  What's GCHQ's input?

914
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,960
They confirm
the Department of Energy

915
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:07,480
and Climate Change has been
an intelligence collection

916
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:11,040
target for China and Russia,
but in terms of active state action

917
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:13,360
and these kind of tactics,
in this area...

918
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:16,480
Why do the dirty work yourself, if
you can pull the strings remotely?

919
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,080
Smart.

920
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:21,520
And if we follow the money,
where does that take us?

921
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:24,360
Well, Russia does have a huge
oil industry.

922
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:26,920
And with the melting
of the ice caps, it is

923
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:29,720
looking to exploit the Arctic,
but...

924
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:32,760
Yes, if you really want to follow
the money, it takes us

925
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:35,360
back here, to the US.

926
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:38,360
Oil lobbies. Exxon, Koch Brothers.

927
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:40,440
They're the ones with real
skin in the game.

928
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:43,040
Someone out there knows
who did this.

929
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:45,880
Who the gun for hire hacker
was and who was paying them.

930
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:48,000
How the
hell are we meant to find them,

931
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,120
if the internet makes
a joke of the search?

932
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,600
OK, let's try again.

933
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:09,360
Like this...

934
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:10,880
The facts are this.

935
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,040
The facts are this.

936
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:22,960
This is a House of Commons select
committee. They'll be out for meat.

937
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,720
You've got to get them on side.

938
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,480
You do know what's at stake here?

939
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,480
Oh...

940
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:40,720
What I don't get is,
this is all you've ever done.

941
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:45,080
For the last 30 years, you've stuck
it out, you've been loyal, whatever.

942
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:47,720
This has been your life!

943
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:50,920
I mean, don't you care?!

944
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,240
Yes.

945
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:57,000
What?  Yes! I do care!

946
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:00,640
Maybe...

947
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:04,840
Phil.

948
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:06,160
Phil?

949
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,680
What do you want me not to say?

950
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:45,440
I don't want you not to say
anything.

951
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:50,160
I just want you to tell the truth.

952
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:53,480
But in a way that it can be
understood. Short answers.

953
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:54,880
No jargon.

954
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,600
Why does this all matter?

955
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,040
What?

956
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,720
Well...

957
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:12,240
Because what's... What they...

958
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,360
Because it isn't true.

959
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:19,360
Right. But beyond that?

960
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:22,560
What happens if they win?

961
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:26,280
What happens if everyone ignores
your measurements, your graphs?

962
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:31,040
Well...

963
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:34,680
I suppose we'll just carry on
emitting more greenhouse gases.

964
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:37,720
Global temperatures will
continue to increase.

965
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:40,120
And if we do that,
what actually happens?

966
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:44,480
Well, the projection hasn't changed.
It's still the same.

967
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,000
The same as what?

968
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,440
As when US scientists first
studied it in the '70s.

969
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:51,800
Go on.

970
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:57,440
Well, a doubling of CO2 emissions
in the atmosphere will

971
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:01,880
result in a 1.5 to 4.5 degree
increase.

972
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:05,080
In what?
Average surface temperature.

973
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:12,440
Polar amplification will mean
that melting in the poles will be
greater.

974
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:16,240
Maybe as much as ten degrees.

975
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,640
What happens, Phil,

976
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:20,520
for our children

977
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:24,720
and their children?
No numbers, just the consequences.

978
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:34,600
Well...

979
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:38,280
By 2100,

980
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:43,200
dust bowl conditions
across North America and Africa,

981
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,000
Asia too.

982
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:51,480
Sooner than that,
a massive reduction in agricultural

983
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:54,960
production,
access to drinking water,

984
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:57,360
migration in huge numbers.

985
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:00,520
Um...

986
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:07,080
Bushfires on a massive scale
in Australia, the West Coast.

987
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:14,840
Annual melting at the poles,
the West Antarctic ice sheet,

988
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:17,600
well, because of that,

989
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:22,040
the global sea level rise of,
well...

990
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,080
..metres.

991
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:29,840
But what does that all mean for us?
People.

992
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:31,560
Make me see it, Phil.

993
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:33,280
Well...

994
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:36,040
In this worst case scenario...

995
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:42,520
..70% of the habitable world will
no longer be able to sustain

996
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:44,000
human life.

997
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:49,040
Millions of species will become
extinct.

998
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:54,320
And coastal
and delta cities will be underwater.

999
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:57,200
And, well...

1000
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:04,040
..if the methane in the permafrost
and on the seabed is released,

1001
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:05,240
well...

1002
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:07,360
Yes?

1003
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:12,320
The climate will collapse.

1004
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:16,920
And the world as we know it...

1005
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:20,600
..will be gone.

1006
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:37,160
Now, we know there are some people
out there who think

1007
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:40,280
everything you've just said
is bollocks.

1008
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:42,960
Maybe even some of the hearing
committee, who knows?

1009
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:47,160
But if you can remember
everything you just said

1010
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:50,560
when you're answering them, no
matter how dry those answers are...

1011
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:54,520
..then we don't have
to worry about it.

1012
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:03,880
Let's take a break.

1013
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:11,000
Anything?

1014
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:15,040
It's the same names cropping up
again and again.

1015
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:18,320
With tobacco in the '70s,
acid rain in the '80s,

1016
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:20,080
and now with global warming.

1017
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:23,160
It's not just the same strategy,
it's the same bloody people.

1018
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:27,920
But all this now with Phil,
the emails, it's just...

1019
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:31,960
The latest battle in the longer war.

1020
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:36,880
It always is, son.

1021
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,120
You'll come to see that.

1022
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:44,160
It always is.

1023
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:53,280
They're going to tear him apart.

1024
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:57,160
We've still got a couple more days.

1025
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:02,360
We'll have to rehearse
the hell out of him.

1026
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:05,000
Choreograph it step by step.

1027
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,240
Royal Ballet will have nothing on us
by the time we're done.

1028
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:24,880
So why not release the data?
Shouldn't everyone get to see it?

1029
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:28,200
Don't focus on how you feel,
focus on how you come across.

1030
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:32,200
How is someone sitting
there on the other side seeing you?

1031
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:36,560
The select committee hearing is
your only chance to defend yourself.

1032
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,520
So, how is that right,

1033
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:41,520
to stop other scientists
publishing their findings?

1034
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:44,680
Weren't you just using your position
to quash other opinions?

1035
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:51,040
Yes or no, did you ask
your colleagues to delete emails?

1036
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,200
There was no manipulation, yup...

1037
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:56,640
So you've been manipulating
the historic records, is that right?

1038
01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:02,680
So, there was no manipulation,
just adjustment in the pursuit

1039
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:06,680
of accuracy
because that's how science works.

1040
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:09,400
That's...how we get to the truth.

1041
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:14,840
SLOW CLAPPING

1042
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:17,520
APPLAUSE

1043
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:21,320
Well done, Phil. Well done!

1044
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:33,600
How are you feeling?

1045
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:46,840
Just show them who you are.

1046
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:49,720
What else can I do?  No, I...

1047
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:56,400
Do you remember when we first met?

1048
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:01,040
In the halls of residence?

1049
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:04,560
I was playing darts and your room
was on the other side of the wall.

1050
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:07,720
You came out to ask us to be quiet.
It was... It was distracting.

1051
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:09,200
I know!

1052
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:18,160
The way you asked us,
the way you carried yourself.

1053
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:21,120
I could tell straight away,
here was a good man.

1054
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:26,240
A kind man.

1055
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:29,800
A man of integrity.

1056
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:36,760
All the pieces of that
man are still here, Philip...

1057
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:42,320
..which means so is he.

1058
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:48,080
That's who I want you to show them.

1059
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:27,120
You'll be fine, Phil.
Watch your shoe.

1060
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:36,480
Here we are. OK, so, good luck
gentlemen.  You're not coming in?

1061
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:39,840
Not going to help your cause
if the press see me in there.

1062
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,840
Keep to the brief.  Good luck.

1063
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:47,760
This is the only day of verbal
evidence for the select committee

1064
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:50,280
and they're keen to
hear from their star witness,

1065
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:53,920
the former head of the climate
research unit at the University

1066
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:58,080
of East Anglia, and the subject
of many of those emails, Phil Jones.

1067
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:01,680
This is the first time he's come
under close public scrutiny.

1068
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:06,760
So, shall we begin,
Professor Jones, Professor Acton?

1069
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:11,600
Thank you. I do have a general
statement I'd like to make.  No.

1070
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,600
No general statements, please.

1071
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,760
Oh, Jesus!  Just answer the questions
when you're asked them.

1072
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:23,600
Perhaps I could just go back to one
of Lord Lawson's earlier comments.

1073
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:25,000
What did I miss?

1074
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:29,320
That without an understanding
of the methodology, that the

1075
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:33,880
peer review system is rather
defunct?

1076
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:37,760
Well, the, um...

1077
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:41,240
The methods are published in the

1078
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:44,440
scientific papers, um, that...

1079
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:47,600
That... That... Relatively simple.

1080
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:51,440
There's nothing sort of rocket
science about them. They're...

1081
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:56,200
Can you explain your email exchange
on the 21st of January 2005,

1082
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:59,560
when you say you aren't going to...
How are they doing?

1083
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:03,360
Not bad.
..Find something wrong with it?

1084
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:07,640
That's the nature of scientific
pursuits, isn't it?

1085
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:11,760
Well, I've obviously written some very awful emails. CHUCKLING

1086
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:20,200
Let's get you home.

1087
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:02,080
You found him.

1088
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:32,720
..To look at the key works of CRU,

1089
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:36,880
to reaffirm the sure-fire
quality of the science

1090
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:40,600
and my I end by saying
just how proud

1091
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:45,760
I am of the contribution that UEA
and CRU in particular has

1092
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:52,000
made to humanity's ability
to understand climate change.

1093
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:56,480
So, what happens now?

1094
01:18:58,280 --> 01:18:59,640
We wait.

1095
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:14,480
We wait.

1096
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:44,800
Ah, Trevor.
Do you know what time the select
committee will publish their report?

1097
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:48,600
Some time in the morning,
so they said.  Right.

1098
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:54,360
Are you familiar with
the Fermi paradox...

1099
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:59,360
..the contradiction of lack
of evidence for alien life,

1100
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:04,480
and considering the size
and age of the universe,

1101
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:07,800
the high possibility
of its existence?  Yes, yes.

1102
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:09,680
The great science.  Yeah.

1103
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:17,160
I read a paper yesterday that
suggested climate change

1104
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:18,920
might be the answer.

1105
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:25,160
There have perhaps been other
civilisations, thousands...

1106
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:29,160
..but they all did what
we're doing now,

1107
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:33,480
became more and more advanced
and in doing so...  Yes, I see.

1108
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:35,960
..burnt themselves out.
Bright and brief.

1109
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:42,320
It does make you wonder, doesn't it,

1110
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:47,680
if all this we're
fighting against is, well...

1111
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,440
..possibly what we're meant to do?

1112
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:54,880
I'll admit humanity does
have something of a gift

1113
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:58,040
for normalising great change,

1114
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:00,520
even when it threatens us.

1115
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:03,880
But we do also have a
gift for survival

1116
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:08,000
against predators, disease,
dictators.

1117
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:11,680
We do somehow survive.

1118
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,760
Even if how we live is
the danger?

1119
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:21,160
You have to hope so, don't you?

1120
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:26,800
Goodnight, Trevor.

1121
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:01,120
"The focus on Professor Phil
Jones and CRU has been...

1122
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:04,880
"Has been misplaced.

1123
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:10,800
"Within the inquiry,
and the evidence we took,

1124
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:13,640
"the scientific
reputation of Professor Jones

1125
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:15,920
"and CRU remains intact.

1126
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:19,640
"We have found no reason in
this unfortunate episode...

1127
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:24,720
"..to challenge the scientific
consensus that global warming

1128
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:27,640
"is happening
and is induced by human activity.

1129
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:31,320
"In so far as we've been able to
consider accusations of dishonesty,

1130
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:34,360
"for example, Professor Jones'
alleged attempt to hide

1131
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:36,360
"the decline, we consider
there is...

1132
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:42,680
"There is no case to answer."

1133
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:11,640
..The work done by CRU and have
no doubt that for all of us,

1134
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:17,520
our children and our grandchildren,
Phil Jones was

1135
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:22,280
and is the right man
in the right place

1136
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:23,760
at the right time.

1137
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:27,200
Phil Jones.

1138
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:29,000
Phil Jones.  Phil Jones.

1139
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:35,960
All the other reports reached
the same conclusion.

1140
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:39,280
There were seven,
in total, by the end.

1141
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:44,840
Even one that no-one knew about,
the...

1142
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:47,640
The United States Environmental
Protection Agency?

1143
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:51,720
"A manufactured controversy".

1144
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:54,960
That's what they called it.

1145
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:03,600
For us though, it didn't feel like
we could even begin to move on

1146
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:09,000
until two years later when this big
project in California happened.

1147
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:14,080
Berkeley Earth, it was called, set
up to prove Philip's work was wrong.

1148
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:16,640
Anyway...

1149
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:21,800
..they took all the
data CRU had used

1150
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:24,360
and started from scratch.

1151
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:31,720
With some known sceptics on the team
too, even Steve Mosher,

1152
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:34,440
the man who first picked out
those extracts.

1153
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,520
The Trick, Hide the Decline.

1154
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:40,240
Even him.

1155
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:43,880
And what do you know?

1156
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:48,360
Came up with the same
results as Philip.

1157
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:53,120
The same results.

1158
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:57,720
Phil.

1159
01:25:57,720 --> 01:25:59,840
It's...  Sam.

1160
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:01,520
I remember.

1161
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:06,040
How are you?

1162
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:09,320
I'm very good.

1163
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:11,680
Yes, good, good. Yeah.

1164
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:13,560
Oh, this is me.

1165
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:18,520
Good to see you.  And you, Sam.

1166
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:19,840
Yeah.

1167
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:21,360
Yeah, take care.

1168
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:22,840
Yeah, and you.

1169
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:02,080
Everything that happened back then,
the hacking,

1170
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:03,920
other campaigns,

1171
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:07,760
it had a significant
effect on public opinion.

1172
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:11,840
Cost us between eight to ten years,
according to some studies.

1173
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:16,920
A decade, so, yes, we could have
had 20 years to sort this out,

1174
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:20,160
but now, we've only got around ten.

1175
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:21,520
If that.

1176
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:26,360
And who's pushing
hardest for action?

1177
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:31,840
The children, people Lily's age,
which does give me some hope.

1178
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:38,800
They understand, you see,
what needs to be done.

1179
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:40,400
And who knows?

1180
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:43,480
If it only took one generation
to break the planet,

1181
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:45,920
why can't it take just
one to fix it?

1182
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:53,520
I know we should have more time,
but at least we do still have time.

1183
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:57,560
Just.
