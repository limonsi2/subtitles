00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:30,797
Sonny...

4
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,298
It's Christmas Eve,
you gotta stop

5
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:33,166
rearranging the tree.

6
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,167
I know, I know.

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,435
I just--
[grunts]

8
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:36,936
I want it to be perfect

9
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,705
when we take our Christmas
Morning pictures.

10
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:41,074
I don't know who's more
obsessed with Christmas,

11
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:42,108
you or Ari.

12
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:44,277
Oh! Speaking of,
is she's sleeping?

13
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,645
Yeah, finally.

14
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:46,579
Okay, great.

15
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:47,580
I can start wrapping gifts.

16
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:49,049
Okay, wait,
hold on, let me--

17
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:50,383
Let me check something quick.

18
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:55,021
Oh, boy.

19
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,323
What?
What is it?

20
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:59,159
You know how that
streaming service

21
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:00,093
bought the rights
to my article

22
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,361
about The Alamainian Peacock?

23
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,696
[chuckles]
Of course.

24
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:03,930
How can I forget?

25
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:05,065
You helped them turn it
into a miniseries.

26
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,132
Yeah, I also agreed

27
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,901
to do a one episode special
for them.

28
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:10,070
Oh, my God, honey.

29
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,204
That's great.

30
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,739
Well, yeah, I mean,
it would be, except

31
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:14,307
um, I was expected
to turn in a draft

32
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:17,344
by midnight tonight
and I haven't written a word.

33
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:18,611
Oh, my God, what?
Why not?

34
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:20,180
Well, I got

35
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:21,381
deadlines at the paper,

36
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,816
and there's chaos back home.

37
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:24,551
I mean, can you ask
for an extension?

38
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,618
I tried.

39
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:27,153
And according the e-mail,

40
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:28,588
they didn't buy my grandmother

41
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:30,090
is possessed
by the devil excuse.

42
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,827
I-- I'm afraid they're not gonna
want to work with me again.

43
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,931
I mean, you still have a couple
of hours left until midnight.

44
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:41,735
I can't write a whole movie
in that time.

45
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,703
I mean, what if I help you?

46
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:45,238
I don't even have a story idea!

47
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,809
What about a Christmas movie?

48
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:53,179
* *

49
00:02:58,278 --> 00:02:59,612
- Where would we start?
- Okay, well--

50
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:02,048
All the best Christmas movies

51
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:05,485
always take place in quaint
little towns,

52
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,721
full of mom-and-pop shops,

53
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,557
and lots of holiday cheer.

54
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,126
* *

55
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:15,595
DELICIOUS EATS

56
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:21,968
TIS THE SEASON
THANK YOU

57
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:22,736
SALEM INN

58
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:28,441
Christmas cookies,
get your free sam--

59
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:30,343
Hey, you!
One per customer!

60
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,145
Uh, enjoy it, sir,

61
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:33,346
and merry Christmas.

62
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,148
Don't be a Scrooge, Dupree.

63
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:37,751
What? I'm just saying
we have a business to run.

64
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:39,586
- Come on, come on!
- Let-- just wait, just wait.

65
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:42,088
- What?
- These cookies smell really,
really, really good.

66
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:43,490
- No, no, no, no.
- Really good.

67
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:45,425
Excuse me, oh, we have
so much work to do, come on.

68
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:46,659
Gabi!

69
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:49,195
Dear.

70
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,431
It's my order ready?

71
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:52,832
Oh, yes, uh...
Your order.

72
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:55,735
I'm so sorry, I have been
swamped and...

73
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:57,604
I've been going crazy
trying to find

74
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:59,739
those VR goggles
that Ari wants from Santa so...

75
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:04,477
I will have those dresses
to you by Christmas.

76
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:07,047
Well, hopefully you do.

77
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:09,616
Or I'll have to take
my business elsewhere.

78
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,086
[people chattering]

79
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,626
[sighs]

80
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,129
Hey, honey, I was thinking.

81
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:25,165
You know, might just
increase our business

82
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:28,234
if we were to decorate a little
bit more for the holidays.

83
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,070
Make it more festive.

84
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,872
Mom, you know
how I hate Christmas.

85
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:34,774
Okay, wait, why do
she hates Christmas?

86
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:38,445
Because there's always
some tragic backstory,

87
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,447
like someone she loved

88
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,982
died on Christmas
many years ago.

89
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:43,883
[chuckles]

90
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:45,819
Someone she loved...

91
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,262
[sighs]

92
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:02,035
You know, your dad would hate it
if he knew he was the reason

93
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,070
for you losing
your Christmas spirit.

94
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:06,206
It's not just that,

95
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,375
um, Christmas is not
the way it used to be.

96
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:11,177
It's all been coopted
by big businesses now,

97
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:14,080
it's all about materialism
and greed.

98
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:15,448
Doesn't have to be.

99
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,818
It can be about...

100
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:21,321
love, caring.

101
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:22,922
Merry Christmas.

102
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:24,958
Oh, Sydney, merry Christmas!

103
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,226
- Look at you--
- Oh.

104
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,394
Can I have a hug?

105
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:28,361
- Sure.
- Oh!

106
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:31,364
Hello, Samantha.

107
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:33,566
Merry Christmas, EJ.

108
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,701
[chuckles]

109
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:37,704
Aw, look at you.

110
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,072
Mm.

111
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,473
What a pretty dress you have.

112
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,642
Thanks, my mommy
bought it for me.

113
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,412
[sing-song]
Custom made for her in Italy.

114
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:49,215
Hi, sweetheart.

115
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:51,451
[kiss]

116
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:52,652
Sorry I'm late.

117
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:53,453
[chuckles]

118
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:54,521
Looks like you bought out

119
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:55,889
the entire haul
in town square.

120
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,357
Oh, well, what can I say,

121
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,958
I was in the holiday spirit.

122
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:01,494
I mean, who doesn't
love Christmas?

123
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:02,562
Oh, sorry.

124
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:07,534
I mean, I know it's a hard
time of the year for you.

125
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:10,070
If I remember correctly,

126
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,706
Sami, your father died
on Christmas,

127
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:15,475
and, Marlena,
your beloved husband.

128
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,180
[laughing]

129
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,815
Merry Christmas, kids!

130
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:23,116
How's the cookie business?

131
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,384
Well, dad,
you gotta try these.

132
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,086
These are fantastic, right here.

133
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,487
Maybe later, son.

134
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,457
I have got an inn to run.

135
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:39,065
[phone ringing]

136
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,474
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa...

137
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,542
[phone ringing]

138
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:52,078
Salem Inn,
John Black speaking.

139
00:06:55,248 --> 00:07:00,420
Sure, I think we may have an
opening for that weekend.

140
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:03,456
Just a second,
hold on a second.

141
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:07,794
Honey, do you know where the
reservation book is?

142
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:10,096
WOMAN: Hold your horses,
I've got it right here.

143
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:12,699
Ah...

144
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,436
What would I do without
my darling wife?

145
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,282
* *

146
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:34,387
WOMAN: Like sands
through the hourglass,

147
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:37,190
so are the Days of Our Lives.

148
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:41,628
A VERY SALEM CHRISTMAS

149
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:47,334
SANTA: Ho, ho, ho,
ho, ho!

150
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:04,884
Okay, so,
EJ is married to Nicole...

151
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:06,019
Mm-hm.

152
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,554
And then John
is married to Kristen

153
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,089
and your grandma Marlena is...

154
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:10,490
Is the lonely widow.

155
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:13,093
Are you intentionally
trolling your family?

156
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:14,627
Is for the benefit
of the story.

157
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,262
Yeah, but all these
Christmas movies,

158
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:18,131
they're about, you know, love.

159
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,666
Yeah, what's a good love story

160
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,701
without some twist
and turns?

161
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:22,502
Mm-hm.

162
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:23,236
Those look good.

163
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:28,575
Hey, you're eating
all of our samples.

164
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:30,677
I'm so sorry.
They're just really good.

165
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,813
Okay, why don't you come inside
and buy a dozen or so?

166
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,682
I should, but I'm--

167
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,283
I'm actually late for something,
I gotta go.

168
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:39,185
Take this one for the road.

169
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:40,854
Merry Christmas, thank you,
these are so good.

170
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,256
- Hey--
- Cheap-ass mother...

171
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,058
Eh-eh-eh... Mm.

172
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,627
Hey, look, it is your boyfriend.

173
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,863
Ah, what happened
to all the samples?

174
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:51,698
Brady cleared us out.

175
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,266
- Oh, that's cold.
- Yeah.

176
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:56,569
But, don't worry, I saved
something sweet...

177
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:58,405
for my man.

178
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,643
[sighs]

179
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:04,811
Gross.

180
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,646
You said it, sis.

181
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:12,152
You'd think Sydney
doesn't have any dresses.

182
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:13,820
Did you see how many
bags Nicole had with her?

183
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,055
Lot of bags.

184
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:16,122
All right.

185
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:17,257
Cappuccino?

186
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,526
With a touch of cinnamon.

187
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,895
- Oh...
- Just the way you like it.

188
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,897
You're a lifesaver.

189
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,031
What are best friends for?

190
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:26,199
Mm.

191
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,500
Ah...

192
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:30,036
Wait, okay, I'm-- um...

193
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,338
Gabi and Nick?

194
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:32,839
- They're best friends?
- Yeah.

195
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:35,208
Why is Nick even
a character in the story?

196
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,711
Well, because he's part
of the family, you know?

197
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,146
And, uh, he moved back
to get to know us Hortons

198
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,416
and I saw a kinder,
gentler side of him.

199
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,885
Before he tormented
you and Gabi

200
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,587
and completely went
over the edge?

201
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,823
Yes, obviously before that.

202
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:51,825
Okay, you--
you are the writer.

203
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:55,395
Yes, I am the writer
who's on a roll thanks to you.

204
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,564
Thank you, okay, so,
moving right along.

205
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,566
Okay, so, uh...

206
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:03,069
This new and improved
and sweeter and gentler Nick

207
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,938
is secretly in love
with his best friend.

208
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,474
Yes, and even though
he's perfect for her

209
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:10,443
and he's right under
her nose, she can't see it.

210
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:12,345
Because...

211
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:15,548
Because she has a crush
on someone else.

212
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,052
Christmas greetings one at all.

213
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,521
- Brady, you're here!
- Why, why--

214
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:22,822
Why are you here?

215
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:25,091
Oh. I'm here for my fitting,
of course.

216
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,593
I'm making him
a bespoke suit.

217
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,294
- Oh, now?
- Mm-hm.

218
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:30,130
Well, no, it's just, um...

219
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:31,631
She was just--
she was talking about--

220
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,600
You were talking
about how swamped--

221
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,868
We're really swamped.

222
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:37,003
No, I always have time
for my favorite customer.

223
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:38,104
Are you kidding me?

224
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,305
Oh, you're gonna look
so handsome.

225
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:40,407
Even more handsome.

226
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,308
I don't even know
if that's possible.

227
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:43,643
You....

228
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:44,811
You're so kind.

229
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,613
Ah, let me get
my measuring tape.

230
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,348
- Thanks.
- Okay.

231
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,056
Sydney, I was cleaning
out some closets upstairs.

232
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:59,793
I found all these supplies
for making homemade ornaments.

233
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,327
I'm not gonna
have a Christmas tree

234
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:03,630
so I thought
you might like them.

235
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,597
Thank you, Sami.

236
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:05,832
Okay...

237
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,636
Is there a problem?

238
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:13,073
Oh, we don't have room
for homemade ornaments.

239
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:14,574
Mom.

240
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,076
Honey, you know
how we feel about glitter

241
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:18,078
and it takes
months to clean it up.

242
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:19,913
Oh, the horror.

243
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:21,448
[chuckles]

244
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:22,749
Sorry.
[clears throat]

245
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:24,417
I-- I should have asked first.

246
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:28,254
Uh, how's-- how's business?

247
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:30,724
Oh, um, yeah.

248
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:32,359
Well, um, you know,

249
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:34,094
it's just hard staying
afloat these days.

250
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:38,098
I'm so sorry, I know how much
this pub means to you.

251
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:40,100
Yeah.

252
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:42,469
Yeah, my grandparents
built it from nothing and...

253
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:44,137
passed it on to my dad.

254
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,438
[clicks tongue]

255
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:47,607
It must be rough.

256
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,610
Letting down multiple
generations of your family.

257
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:51,277
Nicole.

258
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:52,512
I'm just saying,

259
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,115
you must feel an enormous
amount of pressure.

260
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:57,150
Ooh.

261
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:00,687
You know what?

262
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,623
Sami's been doing
a fabulous job

263
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:05,425
and-- and Sean, Caroline,

264
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,394
even Roman would be so
proud of you.

265
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:09,195
Thanks, mom.

266
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,364
Oh, I found this outside,

267
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:12,799
it's-- it's got
your name on it.

268
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:14,401
Oh, I'm sure
it's just a bill.

269
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:15,468
[chuckles]

270
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:20,407
The heck is this?

271
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:24,644
What the heck is this?

272
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:27,781
The heck is this?

273
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:31,351
What the heck is this?

274
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:33,486
Wait, what the heck is it?

275
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,221
It's an eviction notice.

276
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:37,590
What?

277
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:42,595
It says that I have
to close up the pub.

278
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:44,264
I have to be outta here
before Christmas.

279
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:46,833
[breathing heavily]

280
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:49,536
SONNY: Mm, okay.

281
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:51,738
Okay, harsh,

282
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,006
but I see what you were doing.

283
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,508
The eviction connects
the stories together.

284
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:56,543
Exactly.

285
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:59,713
So who is the big bad Scrooge?

286
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:03,283
The evil villain trying
to toss our heroes

287
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:04,884
out onto the streets?

288
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:06,786
Well, it needs
to be a total diva.

289
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,588
[laughing]

290
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,889
I know who it should be.

291
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:11,958
Wow, wow.

292
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,328
[chuckles]

293
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:16,796
Watch out, Salem.

294
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,099
Price Town is back.

295
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:22,402
It'll be
the best Christmas ever.

296
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:24,604
[laughing]

297
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:35,081
Mary, I need you
in my office now.

298
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:41,354
1001, 1002, 1003, 1000--

299
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:42,355
Yes, Miss Price.

300
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:43,656
You're not Mary.

301
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,358
You fired Mary last week.

302
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:47,460
I'm Leo, her replacement.

303
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,662
Wait, okay, I'm sorry.

304
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:51,898
Leo Stark is in the story?

305
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,366
Yeah.

306
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,102
Every villain needs
a weaselly henchman, right?

307
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:58,838
And they don't make 'em
any weasellier

308
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:00,273
than Leo Stark.

309
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,843
No lies detected, proceed.

310
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:05,345
- Mary!
- [gasps]

311
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:06,746
Leo, ma'am.

312
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:07,947
Whatever.

313
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:10,150
Did you deliver
all the eviction notices?

314
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,651
- I did.
- [chuckles]

315
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:13,687
Wish I could've seen
the look

316
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,556
on the faces
of all those losers.

317
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,825
Wah, wah!

318
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:19,826
[laughing]

319
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:20,960
Ah, once they're out,

320
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:22,462
there will be nothing
to stop me

321
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:25,365
from leveling this town
and achieving my dream.

322
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:28,768
'Cause who doesn't love
a big impersonal discount store?

323
00:14:28,802 --> 00:14:30,670
[laughing]

324
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:33,440
You silly little elf,

325
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:36,910
Price Town isn't just
a store anymore,

326
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:38,578
it's a concept.

327
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:42,148
It's luxury condos,
exclusive restaurants,

328
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:43,817
a whole new way of life,

329
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:47,587
not just rinky-dinky
mom-and-pop shops.

330
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,924
Price Town is going
to reinvent Salem, USA.

331
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:52,792
And make me hella rich
in the process.

332
00:14:52,826 --> 00:14:55,995
That does sound fabulous, boss.

333
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:59,566
But if I may, there's just
one teeny tiny hiccup.

334
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,435
You're going to give me bad
news?

335
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:04,104
'Cause I don't like
bad news, Mary.

336
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:07,240
Leo, and it seems
that the property

337
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:08,575
stretching from the Horton
Town Square

338
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:09,776
all the way to the Brady Pub

339
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:12,245
sits on specially
designated land.

340
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,047
Designated by whom?

341
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,049
The Office
of Historic Preservation?

342
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:19,419
That doesn't sound like
a teeny tiny hiccup.

343
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:22,055
That sounds like a biggie,
largie hiccup.

344
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:23,156
Well, I'm sorry, but I--

345
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:25,125
[grunts]
Ow!

346
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:26,426
What was that for?

347
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:28,361
I don't like hearing problems!

348
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:30,230
I like hearing solutions!

349
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,064
Fix it, Mary!

350
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,799
- How?
- Well, uh--

351
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:37,070
By doing what I do
with everything.

352
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:41,341
Throw money at it.

353
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:46,112
EVICTION NOTICE

354
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:48,114
Why would your mother
be shutting us down?

355
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:50,617
Ever since Abe ended things
with her,

356
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,086
Mom has gone
full blown Cruella.

357
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:55,855
We put our heart and
soul into that bakery.

358
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:57,424
I'm sorry, guys.

359
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,092
I mean, this is just--

360
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:00,226
This is devastating.

361
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:03,029
Is it though?

362
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:04,097
What do you mean?

363
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,565
Look, don't get me wrong,

364
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:08,535
opening the bakery with
you has been amazing, but...

365
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:11,237
I don't know, I--
Real talk?

366
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:14,107
I'm tired of waking up at the
butt crack of dawn every day?

367
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,043
And, I don't, know I've been
itching to travel again.

368
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:19,646
You know the, uh, Italian Alps

369
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,247
are breathtaking
this time of year.

370
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:24,784
Ooh, I've always
wanted to go there.

371
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,686
I'm not sure if I can
get time off.

372
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,655
I understand.

373
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:30,123
They must really
rely on you

374
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,391
down at the free clinic

375
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:32,359
you're helping
so many people.

376
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:33,960
For free.

377
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,762
Aw, it's not
about the money.

378
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:37,564
Mm, kinda is, though.

379
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:40,233
I mean, I-- I just want
the world to acknowledge you

380
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:41,468
for your talents.

381
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,069
You know, the way I do.

382
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:44,337
Aw.

383
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:47,107
- Thanks, pookie
- Of course, pookie.

384
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:51,077
I think I'm gonna pukie.

385
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:52,445
You and me both.

386
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,084
I think I'm going to throw up.

387
00:16:58,084 --> 00:16:59,619
There must be
some way to fight this.

388
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:02,655
Miss Price owns this property.

389
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:03,656
I don't know what I can do.

390
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,925
We, Gabi, all right?

391
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:08,862
No matter what happens,
we're in this together.

392
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:11,297
Yep.

393
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:15,235
Look at me.

394
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:17,037
You're a talented,

395
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,438
bright young woman.

396
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:20,040
Okay?

397
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,074
You have so much promise,

398
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:22,409
you're gonna
weather this storm.

399
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:24,344
You really think so?

400
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:27,847
I know so and I'm rarely
if ever wrong, okay?

401
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,082
All right.

402
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:30,417
Um, about my fitting,
can we?

403
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,818
You know what?

404
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:34,354
I'm just thinking
the timing on that

405
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:37,057
might not be perfect.

406
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:39,459
Yeah, I noticed the mood
has changed a little bit,

407
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:41,361
Oh, do you really know
how to read a room?

408
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:44,264
We'll reschedule.

409
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:45,699
I-- I'll call you, yes,

410
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:46,800
I will call you,

411
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,234
so we can figure out
the fitting.

412
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:49,836
Are you sure you're gonna
be able to get it done

413
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:50,904
by Christmas Eve, though?

414
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:52,539
I mean, just in case
you close--

415
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:55,408
Okay, that's like
a week from now.

416
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:57,844
[laughing]
I mean, it's just--

417
00:17:57,877 --> 00:18:00,513
There's-- there's higher things
on-- on your priority list.

418
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:02,315
Okay, no problem,
I'll get it done.

419
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:05,251
Gabi.

420
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:06,753
Yes?

421
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:08,321
You are the best.

422
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:09,589
Oh...

423
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:17,497
JOHN: Booted out at Christmas?

424
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,532
Honey, I know how much
you love our little inn.

425
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:21,901
We still have each other.

426
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:25,305
And we'll get through it.

427
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:26,706
Together.

428
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:34,047
Oh, get a room you two,

429
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:35,648
but you got plenty
to choose from.

430
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:37,117
Not for long.

431
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,685
We just found out
we're getting evicted.

432
00:18:39,753 --> 00:18:40,920
You too.

433
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:41,821
What do you mean?

434
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:43,189
I just heard that Gabi,

435
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:45,925
she and Sweet Bits,
they got eviction notices too.

436
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:49,129
Seems Paulina Price is dumping
all of her tenants at once.

437
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:50,697
I wonder if that means

438
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,298
the pub is getting
shut down too.

439
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:55,368
I'm so sorry, Samantha.

440
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,204
Bad things happen at Christmas.

441
00:18:58,238 --> 00:18:58,972
You know?

442
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:00,006
It's when my dad died.

443
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,741
It's when Lucas ran off

444
00:19:01,775 --> 00:19:04,444
with a drippy Chloe
to Antarctica.

445
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:08,415
Well, I for one, love Christmas,

446
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:10,417
the extravagant parties,

447
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,018
the lavish gifts.

448
00:19:12,052 --> 00:19:13,920
That's not really
what it's about, mommy.

449
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,456
I can't wait to see
what EJ gets me this year.

450
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:22,128
Oh, I have my eye on this
exquisite sapphire necklace.

451
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:24,564
Nicole, maybe we should
be a little more sensitive

452
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:26,466
to what Samantha and
Marlena are going through?

453
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,668
I'm sorry,
am I being insensitive?

454
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:32,272
Yes, I love the pub and I don't
want it to go away.

455
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:34,808
Oh, neither do I, Syd.

456
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:37,243
Excuse me, I'm--

457
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:39,279
I'm gonna make a call

458
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:42,782
and see if I can get
some help with this.

459
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:46,319
[sighs]

460
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:51,891
Oof, oof!

461
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:05,005
We're going to need
some help down here.

462
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:09,909
Maybe even a Christmas miracle.

463
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:20,253
John.

464
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:22,756
Hello, Marlena.

465
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:26,826
Oh, I see.

466
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,094
You got the same eviction.

467
00:20:28,128 --> 00:20:29,229
Yeah.

468
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:33,466
Certainly was
a kick in the gut, but...

469
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,504
thankfully, I have
Kristen lean on.

470
00:20:40,674 --> 00:20:41,675
KRISTEN: Brady.

471
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:49,983
I thought you left
with your father.

472
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:52,886
I forgot
that I have a gift for you.

473
00:20:54,888 --> 00:20:56,589
You wanna open it?

474
00:21:08,335 --> 00:21:09,903
[moaning]

475
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:19,546
* *

476
00:21:28,755 --> 00:21:30,590
SALEM INN

477
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,296
ONE WEEK LATER...

478
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:37,597
[door opens]

479
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,431
MARLENA: Oof!

480
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:41,935
Good morning, Marlena.

481
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,005
John.

482
00:21:45,105 --> 00:21:47,173
What brings you
by the Salem Inn?

483
00:21:47,207 --> 00:21:51,478
Uh. Oh, I was in
the neighborhood and...

484
00:21:51,511 --> 00:21:53,146
I-- I thought I would drop off

485
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:55,248
your Christmas card in person.

486
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:56,950
Oh, thank you.

487
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,018
That's so nice.

488
00:21:58,118 --> 00:21:59,119
Yeah.

489
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:04,257
Kristen and I
have one for you also.

490
00:22:06,126 --> 00:22:08,061
Oh, thanks.

491
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:11,631
Where is your wife
this morning?

492
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:12,799
She wasn't feeling well.

493
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:14,100
Took the morning off.

494
00:22:15,602 --> 00:22:16,469
Nothing serious, I hope.

495
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:17,671
No, no.

496
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:19,272
I'm sure she'll be
feeling much better

497
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:21,174
after she spends
some time in bed.

498
00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:24,411
[moaning]

499
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:28,548
Merry freaking Christmas!

500
00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:31,251
[Brady laughing]

501
00:22:31,284 --> 00:22:34,354
And happy freaking New year.

502
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:37,857
[moaning]

503
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:40,694
You know what?

504
00:22:40,727 --> 00:22:42,662
I know Christmas Eve
isn't till tomorrow.

505
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,366
I think now is a good time
to give you your gift.

506
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:48,535
Oh, come on,
what are you talking about?

507
00:22:48,568 --> 00:22:53,106
You have been giving me
fantastic gifts all week long,

508
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:55,141
not to mention the amazing
gift you just gave me.

509
00:22:55,175 --> 00:22:56,343
- You know--
- Just, please,

510
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:57,677
let a girl catch her breath?

511
00:22:57,711 --> 00:22:59,245
I'm talking--

512
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:00,480
I'm talking about...

513
00:23:00,513 --> 00:23:02,315
an actual

514
00:23:02,349 --> 00:23:03,516
gift.

515
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,386
[sniffles]

516
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:09,222
- What's that?
- Open it and find out.

517
00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:10,490
No.

518
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:13,293
What do you mean "no"?
Why not?

519
00:23:13,326 --> 00:23:15,295
Because...

520
00:23:15,328 --> 00:23:18,631
our relationship
is built on lust.

521
00:23:18,665 --> 00:23:21,968
And, um, romantic
gestures just...

522
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:23,403
complicate things.

523
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:24,804
[sighs]
Look.

524
00:23:24,838 --> 00:23:26,272
Kristen, I know that's
where we started.

525
00:23:26,306 --> 00:23:28,875
John is my husband
and I love him.

526
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:31,878
Do you?

527
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,813
I mean, do you?
Do you really?

528
00:23:33,847 --> 00:23:35,682
He makes me feel safe.

529
00:23:35,715 --> 00:23:36,983
Safe.

530
00:23:38,218 --> 00:23:40,687
When did safe become
a priority of yours?

531
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,755
Come on, what about--

532
00:23:41,788 --> 00:23:43,423
What about passion?
What about--

533
00:23:43,456 --> 00:23:44,924
I like things
the way they are.

534
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:49,529
Are you really ever
going to be content

535
00:23:49,562 --> 00:23:52,098
with just being
an innkeeper's wife, Kristen?

536
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:53,733
I mean, come on,
you want more.

537
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:54,901
Don't you want more?

538
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:56,202
Not from you.

539
00:23:57,737 --> 00:23:59,105
I'm sorry.

540
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,376
I just don't want your gifts.

541
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:04,477
I don't want your money.

542
00:24:05,478 --> 00:24:06,646
I don't want anything else

543
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,081
that's going on
in that brain of yours.

544
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:09,849
- I see.
- All I want is this.

545
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:15,321
So, basically, what I am
to you is just a hard...

546
00:24:15,355 --> 00:24:16,656
Body.

547
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:17,857
Yeah.

548
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,261
And if you can't accept that,

549
00:24:21,294 --> 00:24:23,430
then I guess you're just
gonna have to move on.

550
00:24:32,072 --> 00:24:34,274
- Looks pretty good.
- Yeah.

551
00:24:37,344 --> 00:24:38,578
How you doing?

552
00:24:40,113 --> 00:24:42,082
I-- I mean,
I know this is a...

553
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:46,086
a rough time of year for you.

554
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:53,226
Well, I miss Roman.

555
00:24:54,761 --> 00:24:56,463
I guess they always will.

556
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:00,166
May I ask you something?

557
00:25:01,201 --> 00:25:02,535
Of course.

558
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:04,637
Why haven't you moved on?

559
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:08,441
I mean, I'm--
I'm sure there are...

560
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:13,713
Must be someone out there
for you somewhere.

561
00:25:16,216 --> 00:25:17,584
[door slams]

562
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:19,853
[laughing]
Good morning people.

563
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:21,721
How we feeling today?

564
00:25:21,755 --> 00:25:23,857
Well, not great,
Miss Price.

565
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,692
Fabulous, fabulous.

566
00:25:25,725 --> 00:25:27,827
Just passing through
with a friendly reminder

567
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:29,462
that you need
to be out by Christmas.

568
00:25:29,496 --> 00:25:31,531
We hadn't forgotten.

569
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:32,899
Mm-hm, good, good.
[chuckles]

570
00:25:32,932 --> 00:25:35,402
You know, Paulina.

571
00:25:35,435 --> 00:25:37,437
You can evict us.

572
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,972
You can...

573
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,173
throw us out on the street,

574
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:42,075
but the city will never
let you destroy

575
00:25:42,075 --> 00:25:44,544
these historic sites
for your precious Price Town

576
00:25:44,577 --> 00:25:45,578
and that's a fact.

577
00:25:45,612 --> 00:25:46,946
[chuckles]
Well...

578
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:50,083
I wouldn't
be too sure about that.

579
00:25:55,121 --> 00:25:56,456
OFFICE OF HISTORIC PRESERVATION

580
00:26:00,827 --> 00:26:02,162
MAN: Come in.

581
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,032
I'm sorry to bother you, sir.

582
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:07,834
My name is Leo Stark
and I was hoping

583
00:26:07,867 --> 00:26:09,035
we could have a little chat.

584
00:26:12,672 --> 00:26:14,240
Hello, Mr. Stark.

585
00:26:15,275 --> 00:26:16,409
How can I help you?

586
00:26:20,447 --> 00:26:22,115
Oh, so, so, Xander

587
00:26:22,148 --> 00:26:23,783
runs the Office
of Historic Preservation.

588
00:26:23,817 --> 00:26:26,519
- Yeah, I like casting its type.
- Mm.

589
00:26:26,553 --> 00:26:29,155
Plus, Leo's always
had a crush on Xander

590
00:26:29,189 --> 00:26:30,390
and I thought

591
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:32,392
it might be fun for those
two to cross again.

592
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:35,061
- Yeah, fun for Leo anyway.
- Yeah.

593
00:26:45,572 --> 00:26:46,606
[sighs]

594
00:26:51,678 --> 00:26:52,879
There's something wrong,
Mr. Stark?

595
00:26:52,912 --> 00:26:55,482
No, it's just--

596
00:26:55,515 --> 00:26:57,484
Office of Historic Preservation,

597
00:26:57,517 --> 00:27:00,020
I was expecting
some old creaky relic,

598
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,155
not a big strapping hunk.

599
00:27:02,188 --> 00:27:03,356
Is there something
I can do for you?

600
00:27:04,657 --> 00:27:06,526
I want to answer that
in so many ways.

601
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,727
I'm sorry?

602
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,130
Let me start over.

603
00:27:10,163 --> 00:27:11,798
My boss, Paulina Price--

604
00:27:11,831 --> 00:27:13,133
Oh, you work for
Miss Price.

605
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:14,768
Yes, and she submitted

606
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:16,736
a proposal for new construction?

607
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:18,638
Mm, I'm-- I'm aware,

608
00:27:18,672 --> 00:27:22,409
I'm afraid that
I'm going to have to...

609
00:27:22,442 --> 00:27:23,810
decline her request.

610
00:27:23,843 --> 00:27:25,078
What, why?

611
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:26,813
Why?

612
00:27:26,846 --> 00:27:30,550
Your boss's plans for Salem
are unethical and offensive.

613
00:27:30,583 --> 00:27:32,452
She'd be tearing out
the very heart of this town.

614
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:33,787
Okay.

615
00:27:35,055 --> 00:27:38,058
So what if she made
a donation to your office?

616
00:27:38,091 --> 00:27:39,826
A very generous one.

617
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:40,593
Cash.

618
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:44,431
Is this a bribe?

619
00:27:44,464 --> 00:27:46,099
More like an incentive?

620
00:27:46,132 --> 00:27:48,368
A gift for a job well done?

621
00:27:49,469 --> 00:27:51,071
I'm afraid I'm going to
have to ask you to leave.

622
00:27:51,071 --> 00:27:52,605
It's a lot of money.

623
00:27:54,741 --> 00:27:56,309
Some things are
more important than money.

624
00:27:57,777 --> 00:27:59,079
Like what?

625
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:01,448
Are you aware that some
of these businesses

626
00:28:01,481 --> 00:28:03,016
have been around for over
50 years?

627
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:05,018
Then isn't it time
for a change?

628
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:06,486
New businesses
can be cheaper to run.

629
00:28:07,587 --> 00:28:10,457
Look, I'm all for progress
and innovation.

630
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,826
But it must honor the--
the history of this town.

631
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:15,929
These places that your boss
wants to tear down,

632
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:19,165
they aren't...
just relics of the past.

633
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:20,934
They're the soul of Salem.

634
00:28:21,034 --> 00:28:23,103
They're bringing
the community together,

635
00:28:23,136 --> 00:28:26,072
uniting people from
all walks of life

636
00:28:26,106 --> 00:28:29,242
and those experiences
and traditions are

637
00:28:29,275 --> 00:28:31,544
passed down from
one generation to the next,

638
00:28:31,578 --> 00:28:33,380
providing a common
thread for all the people

639
00:28:33,413 --> 00:28:34,814
that live in this town.

640
00:28:37,283 --> 00:28:40,453
So your boss wouldn't
just be tearing down buildings,

641
00:28:40,487 --> 00:28:41,721
she would be demolishing

642
00:28:41,755 --> 00:28:44,057
the connective tissue
of Salem itself.

643
00:28:47,527 --> 00:28:49,229
So...

644
00:28:49,262 --> 00:28:50,897
Is that a definite no?

645
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:56,069
DENIED

646
00:29:03,643 --> 00:29:05,178
NICOLE: Sydney, honey don't run,

647
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:06,746
you're gonna ruin your shoes

648
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,282
EJ can you please
talk to your daughter

649
00:29:09,315 --> 00:29:11,618
and ask her to please
act more like--

650
00:29:11,651 --> 00:29:13,019
What?

651
00:29:13,053 --> 00:29:14,821
What are you doing?

652
00:29:14,854 --> 00:29:16,456
EJ.

653
00:29:16,489 --> 00:29:18,491
I'm just helping
the poor man out.

654
00:29:18,525 --> 00:29:21,327
He's just gonna spend it
on drugs and alcohol.

655
00:29:21,361 --> 00:29:22,862
You don't know that.

656
00:29:24,664 --> 00:29:26,232
Where's your Christmas spirit?

657
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,269
Or perhaps I would be
more festive

658
00:29:29,302 --> 00:29:30,670
if we didn't have to keep coming

659
00:29:30,704 --> 00:29:32,472
to this dreadful hole
in the wall

660
00:29:32,505 --> 00:29:35,108
that is run by her ex.

661
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,244
Sydney loves it here

662
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:40,480
and she loves spending time
with Samantha.

663
00:29:42,048 --> 00:29:43,216
Sydney.

664
00:29:45,218 --> 00:29:47,187
Santa pancakes!

665
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,688
I made them especially
for you.

666
00:29:48,722 --> 00:29:50,190
Okay...

667
00:29:51,424 --> 00:29:53,126
You got this, and we have--
That's for you.

668
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:54,227
[Nicole gasps]

669
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,396
Sydney DiMera
put that fork down.

670
00:29:57,697 --> 00:29:59,065
What's the problem?

671
00:29:59,065 --> 00:30:02,268
Uh, it's loaded with sugar
and carbs is the problem.

672
00:30:02,302 --> 00:30:03,737
Sweetheart, it's almost
Christmas

673
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:05,572
and Samantha already went
through all that trouble.

674
00:30:07,907 --> 00:30:09,342
Well, she could have asked me.

675
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:12,312
Come on, Sydney,
honey come over here

676
00:30:12,345 --> 00:30:14,280
and we'll get you
something healthy to eat.

677
00:30:15,548 --> 00:30:16,449
Good girl.

678
00:30:19,152 --> 00:30:21,154
Uh, sorry...

679
00:30:21,187 --> 00:30:22,689
about overstepping again.

680
00:30:22,722 --> 00:30:24,424
No, no, you didn't do
anything wrong.

681
00:30:25,425 --> 00:30:26,793
You're wonderful with her.

682
00:30:28,728 --> 00:30:29,863
I just think Nicole gets

683
00:30:29,896 --> 00:30:30,964
a little threatened
by that sometimes.

684
00:30:34,768 --> 00:30:35,969
What is it?

685
00:30:37,203 --> 00:30:40,473
It's-- it's just sometimes
when I look at the date.

686
00:30:40,507 --> 00:30:42,108
Can't help but think about...

687
00:30:42,142 --> 00:30:43,843
Our daughter?

688
00:30:45,879 --> 00:30:47,647
Grace would have been
the same age.

689
00:30:48,982 --> 00:30:50,383
I'm so sorry, Samantha.

690
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:53,253
I miss her too.

691
00:31:07,133 --> 00:31:08,802
SWEET BITS BAKERY
CLOSED

692
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:12,772
Hey, isn't it a little early
to pack it in?

693
00:31:12,806 --> 00:31:15,342
Well, we're getting
evicted anyway

694
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:17,310
so I was in the mood
for some shopping.

695
00:31:17,344 --> 00:31:19,379
That is an excellent idea.

696
00:31:19,412 --> 00:31:21,948
I have my eye on this new watch.

697
00:31:21,981 --> 00:31:24,117
Ooh, I want a new watch too.

698
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,352
It's Christmas.

699
00:31:25,385 --> 00:31:27,220
You're supposed to get gifts
for other people.

700
00:31:27,253 --> 00:31:30,857
Okay, but isn't loving yourself
the greatest gift of all?

701
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:33,760
See?
Now, she gets me.

702
00:31:33,793 --> 00:31:36,796
How about we go
ice skating at the park?

703
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:37,964
Ooh, yes, yes.

704
00:31:37,997 --> 00:31:39,366
I like the way you think.

705
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:41,534
Okay, but I don't want
to miss the last minute sales.

706
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,370
Well, we can do both, pookie.

707
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:45,105
Okay, pookie.

708
00:31:45,138 --> 00:31:46,573
But shopping first.

709
00:31:49,175 --> 00:31:50,844
All right, we'll
catch up with you later.

710
00:31:50,877 --> 00:31:51,611
Mm-hm.

711
00:31:52,712 --> 00:31:54,481
Drives me crazy.

712
00:31:54,514 --> 00:31:55,615
What?

713
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:58,685
Tripp putting
Chanel's needs above his.

714
00:31:58,718 --> 00:32:00,720
Just so typical of him, right?

715
00:32:00,754 --> 00:32:03,523
So kind and unselfish.

716
00:32:03,556 --> 00:32:04,657
Wait.

717
00:32:05,825 --> 00:32:07,460
Are you in love with Tripp?

718
00:32:07,494 --> 00:32:10,897
What no,
no he's my BFF's boyfriend

719
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:12,899
Look, Allie, it's okay,
no one's judging you.

720
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:14,634
I--

721
00:32:14,668 --> 00:32:17,504
If I'm being honest, uh...

722
00:32:17,537 --> 00:32:18,638
I'm kind of in the same boat.

723
00:32:18,672 --> 00:32:21,074
Are you in love with trip?

724
00:32:21,107 --> 00:32:22,275
No.

725
00:32:23,677 --> 00:32:26,312
But I'm totally
in love with Chanel.

726
00:32:30,684 --> 00:32:31,851
PAULINA: Denied?

727
00:32:31,885 --> 00:32:33,653
Nobody denies me.

728
00:32:33,687 --> 00:32:35,655
He wouldn't take the money.

729
00:32:35,689 --> 00:32:37,657
You're a disgrace,
get out of my office!

730
00:32:37,691 --> 00:32:38,625
Ay!

731
00:32:38,658 --> 00:32:41,094
I'm sorry, Miss Price,
I tried!

732
00:32:41,094 --> 00:32:43,229
But did you know that some
of these buildings

733
00:32:43,263 --> 00:32:45,632
have been here for over 50 years

734
00:32:45,665 --> 00:32:48,802
and Mr. Cook he made this
impassioned speech about--

735
00:32:48,835 --> 00:32:50,570
Out, I said.

736
00:32:52,739 --> 00:32:54,207
Wait!

737
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,575
Where's my money?

738
00:32:57,777 --> 00:32:59,012
Oh, right.

739
00:33:02,048 --> 00:33:03,049
[thud]

740
00:33:05,085 --> 00:33:06,453
Hm.

741
00:33:06,486 --> 00:33:08,388
Textbook Mary.

742
00:33:08,421 --> 00:33:11,057
Oh, well, if you want
something done right,

743
00:33:11,057 --> 00:33:12,559
do it yourself.

744
00:33:13,593 --> 00:33:16,496
At least find
the right partner in crime.

745
00:33:18,832 --> 00:33:22,369
Hello, this is Paulina Price.

746
00:33:22,402 --> 00:33:23,937
We need to talk.

747
00:33:32,712 --> 00:33:34,547
You cannot be serious.

748
00:33:34,581 --> 00:33:36,383
"Die Hard" can't be the best
Christmas movie ever.

749
00:33:36,416 --> 00:33:37,984
Well, it takes
place on Christmas Eve.

750
00:33:38,084 --> 00:33:40,653
But it's about
a guy killing terrorists.

751
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:42,355
To save the woman
that he loves.

752
00:33:42,389 --> 00:33:44,424
It's about family
and friendship...

753
00:33:44,457 --> 00:33:46,426
- And bloodshot...
- And bloodshed?

754
00:33:46,459 --> 00:33:47,794
Yes, okay...

755
00:33:47,827 --> 00:33:48,828
Okay, what's a better
Christmas movie?

756
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:50,363
Oh, I don't know.

757
00:33:50,397 --> 00:33:51,398
"It's a Wonderful Life," maybe?

758
00:33:51,431 --> 00:33:54,801
Oh come on, boring,
so boring.

759
00:33:54,834 --> 00:33:55,935
Basic.

760
00:33:55,969 --> 00:33:57,003
"Home Alone"?

761
00:33:57,103 --> 00:33:58,705
"Home Alone" is--
is just "Die Hard"

762
00:33:58,738 --> 00:34:00,173
for-- for kids.

763
00:34:00,206 --> 00:34:03,043
Okay, "National Lampoon's
Christmas Vacation."

764
00:34:03,043 --> 00:34:04,511
Everybody loves the Griswolds.

765
00:34:04,544 --> 00:34:06,212
Griswolds, brilliant.

766
00:34:06,246 --> 00:34:07,447
Absolutely brilliant.

767
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,349
Cousin Eddie,
obviously the best character

768
00:34:09,382 --> 00:34:11,351
"Save the neck
for me, Clark."

769
00:34:11,384 --> 00:34:12,886
[laughing]

770
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:14,921
What do you--
what are you doing tonight?

771
00:34:14,954 --> 00:34:18,224
Uh. Nothing.

772
00:34:18,258 --> 00:34:19,659
Literally nothing, why?

773
00:34:19,693 --> 00:34:21,594
Do you wanna go to the pub?

774
00:34:21,628 --> 00:34:22,762
There's this cookie
decorating thing.

775
00:34:22,796 --> 00:34:24,864
- Be my partner.
- Yes.

776
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:26,399
Absolutely, you're on.

777
00:34:26,433 --> 00:34:28,768
I knew I could count on you
to be my bestie.

778
00:34:29,836 --> 00:34:31,104
Yeah.

779
00:34:32,906 --> 00:34:35,075
Actually Gabi, there's--

780
00:34:35,108 --> 00:34:37,677
there's something that I
wanted to talk to you about.

781
00:34:37,711 --> 00:34:39,913
Ah, good.
They didn't close it down yet.

782
00:34:39,946 --> 00:34:41,348
Brady!

783
00:34:41,381 --> 00:34:43,083
Is the suit-- is it ready?

784
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:45,385
Oh, yeah, just right here.

785
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:46,386
[chuckles]

786
00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:48,221
Oh, God, it looks great.

787
00:34:48,254 --> 00:34:49,222
I knew I could count on you.

788
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,295
Hot date tonight?

789
00:34:56,563 --> 00:34:58,965
Uh, sadly, no, no.

790
00:34:58,998 --> 00:35:02,435
The woman I'm into
is not into me the same way.

791
00:35:02,469 --> 00:35:05,138
Are you sure, have you--

792
00:35:05,171 --> 00:35:07,040
Who told her how you feel?

793
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,808
No, I don't know.

794
00:35:08,842 --> 00:35:10,410
I mean, I-- I hate rejection.

795
00:35:10,443 --> 00:35:13,046
I'm not used to it, so I'm--

796
00:35:13,046 --> 00:35:15,248
not really great
at expressing my feelings.

797
00:35:15,281 --> 00:35:17,150
I tend to trip over
my words a little bit.

798
00:35:17,183 --> 00:35:19,686
Maybe you can, uh,
write her a letter.

799
00:35:21,254 --> 00:35:22,789
That's--

800
00:35:22,822 --> 00:35:24,257
Actually a great idea.

801
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,158
[zipping]

802
00:35:25,191 --> 00:35:26,259
- I like that.
- Yeah.

803
00:35:26,292 --> 00:35:27,327
Oh, this suit looks great.

804
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,828
How much do I owe you?

805
00:35:28,862 --> 00:35:30,663
Oh, we're-- you know what?
It's nothing.

806
00:35:30,697 --> 00:35:32,665
Gift for Christmas.

807
00:35:32,699 --> 00:35:34,167
- Really.
- NICK: Really?

808
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,869
Yeah, you've been such
a wonderful customer

809
00:35:35,902 --> 00:35:37,871
and the store is gonna
close down anyway.

810
00:35:39,339 --> 00:35:40,740
Well, at least let me--

811
00:35:40,774 --> 00:35:43,443
let me send you a
little something in return.

812
00:35:43,476 --> 00:35:45,245
Can I have your address?

813
00:35:45,278 --> 00:35:47,647
Oh, yeah, kidding me?

814
00:35:47,681 --> 00:35:49,282
Of course you have...

815
00:35:49,315 --> 00:35:50,417
my address.

816
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:51,718
Thanks, thanks.

817
00:35:51,751 --> 00:35:54,587
Um, suit looks great.

818
00:35:54,621 --> 00:35:55,588
Thank you.

819
00:36:02,796 --> 00:36:04,030
[exhales]

820
00:36:05,832 --> 00:36:07,767
You think
he was talking about me?

821
00:36:09,536 --> 00:36:10,470
What do you mean?

822
00:36:10,503 --> 00:36:12,072
The woman

823
00:36:12,105 --> 00:36:13,940
that he said
he has feelings for,

824
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,675
that he's afraid
to open up to.

825
00:36:15,709 --> 00:36:17,177
He said he might
write her a letter and

826
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:18,845
then he asked me for my address.

827
00:36:18,878 --> 00:36:21,848
To thank you for the suit.

828
00:36:21,881 --> 00:36:24,651
I don't know, I just, I--

829
00:36:24,684 --> 00:36:27,087
I kind of feel a vibe.

830
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,356
I don't know if it's
the Christmas spirit but...

831
00:36:30,423 --> 00:36:32,359
Kind of feel like all
my dreams are coming true.

832
00:36:34,661 --> 00:36:36,296
[steps receding]

833
00:36:36,329 --> 00:36:37,230
[sighs]

834
00:36:38,431 --> 00:36:40,767
PAULINA:
Yes, well, thank you.

835
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,203
I'm glad we could
come to an understanding.

836
00:36:43,236 --> 00:36:45,071
Oh, yeah, be in touch.

837
00:36:45,071 --> 00:36:47,073
[laughing]

838
00:36:47,073 --> 00:36:49,909
Well, Mary,

839
00:36:49,943 --> 00:36:51,411
I did it.

840
00:36:51,444 --> 00:36:54,647
The city has approved
the construction of Price Town,

841
00:36:54,681 --> 00:36:57,150
But Hottie McHotFace
wouldn't accept the bribe.

842
00:36:57,183 --> 00:36:58,518
[laughing]

843
00:36:58,551 --> 00:36:59,719
Oh, I found a way around that.

844
00:36:59,753 --> 00:37:01,054
It's all happening.

845
00:37:01,087 --> 00:37:02,222
Nothing could stop me now.

846
00:37:02,255 --> 00:37:03,623
Are you sure about this, boss?

847
00:37:03,656 --> 00:37:05,225
Those places, they mean
a lot to this town.

848
00:37:05,258 --> 00:37:07,127
This calls for a celebration

849
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,462
of epic proportions,
steak, lobster, champagne.

850
00:37:09,496 --> 00:37:11,398
Well, that does
sound divine.

851
00:37:11,431 --> 00:37:13,299
Shall I make a reservation
at the Penthouse Grill?

852
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:14,668
Yeah, for one,

853
00:37:14,701 --> 00:37:16,036
since it was a little old me

854
00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:18,405
who sealed the deal and you,
you did diddly squat.

855
00:37:18,438 --> 00:37:19,873
So you know what?
You get to stay here

856
00:37:19,906 --> 00:37:21,207
and clean up my office.

857
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:25,278
And don't forget
to email one last reminder

858
00:37:25,311 --> 00:37:26,780
about the evictions.

859
00:37:26,813 --> 00:37:28,348
Ta-ta, Mary.

860
00:37:28,381 --> 00:37:29,649
It's Leo.

861
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:41,561
It was so good of you
to think of this.

862
00:37:41,594 --> 00:37:44,330
Oh, wow, I may not
like Christmas but

863
00:37:44,364 --> 00:37:46,766
I do enjoy spending time
with my family and friends

864
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,069
and it's nice to be able
to lift their spirits,

865
00:37:49,069 --> 00:37:51,271
especially given
the circumstances

866
00:37:51,304 --> 00:37:53,940
that we're about
to lose everything.

867
00:37:55,075 --> 00:37:57,444
Snazzy shirt I bought him, huh?

868
00:37:57,477 --> 00:37:59,079
Looks a little tight.

869
00:37:59,112 --> 00:38:01,614
It's fine, as long
as I don't exhale.

870
00:38:03,049 --> 00:38:06,653
I love the way it shows off
your muscles, pookie.

871
00:38:06,686 --> 00:38:07,921
Well, hey, if
he doesn't want it.

872
00:38:08,021 --> 00:38:10,056
Looks like it might
fit me, so...

873
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:13,460
See, now Johnny here
has excellent taste.

874
00:38:18,031 --> 00:38:21,668
I feel like you're more
of a flannel kind of guy,

875
00:38:21,701 --> 00:38:23,036
maybe a size too big.

876
00:38:23,036 --> 00:38:24,738
I do enjoy breathing.

877
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:29,876
[indistinct chatter]

878
00:38:31,644 --> 00:38:34,147
Oh, look who's here!

879
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:37,250
Oh, mom, we have a real life
princess here tonight.

880
00:38:37,283 --> 00:38:39,619
We just got back from seeing
The Nutcracker, didn't we?

881
00:38:39,652 --> 00:38:41,087
Did you like it?

882
00:38:41,121 --> 00:38:42,188
Boring.

883
00:38:42,222 --> 00:38:43,490
Nobody even talks.

884
00:38:43,523 --> 00:38:45,058
- [laughing]
- Oh, dear.

885
00:38:45,058 --> 00:38:47,260
Nicole stayed behind
for the official gala.

886
00:38:47,293 --> 00:38:49,629
I thought this
might be more Sydney's speed.

887
00:38:50,697 --> 00:38:52,499
- Yeah, of course.
- Well, yeah, good, you can--

888
00:38:52,532 --> 00:38:53,633
You can be a team.

889
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:55,535
I want Sami on our team.

890
00:38:55,568 --> 00:38:56,670
It's pairs of two, honey.

891
00:38:56,703 --> 00:38:59,239
Oh, wait, wait,
I'm judging.

892
00:38:59,272 --> 00:39:01,374
I think I can make an exception.

893
00:39:01,408 --> 00:39:02,809
- SAMI: Yay!
- Yay!

894
00:39:02,842 --> 00:39:04,010
[laughing]
Why don't--

895
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:06,012
Why don't you find a place?

896
00:39:06,012 --> 00:39:07,747
We're about to get started.

897
00:39:07,781 --> 00:39:10,684
Yeah, uh, all right,
why don't you go there?

898
00:39:10,717 --> 00:39:12,018
I'll meet you in a minute.

899
00:39:12,052 --> 00:39:13,653
Take your coat off.

900
00:39:21,494 --> 00:39:23,596
[inaudible]

901
00:39:30,904 --> 00:39:31,571
Something wrong?

902
00:39:31,604 --> 00:39:33,106
Oh, no.

903
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:36,142
No, I-- I was just...

904
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:39,579
hoping John might
be coming by.

905
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:47,187
Now, are you sure

906
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,923
that you don't want to go
to Marlena's party?

907
00:39:49,956 --> 00:39:53,126
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry,
I'm just really--

908
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:55,095
I'm just really
not in the mood tonight.

909
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,131
It's all right.

910
00:39:58,164 --> 00:40:01,434
Hey, maybe we can
just snuggle up in bed,

911
00:40:01,468 --> 00:40:03,303
watch a holiday movie,

912
00:40:03,336 --> 00:40:06,373
Maybe the one with
Hugh Grant when he plays

913
00:40:06,406 --> 00:40:08,975
the Prime Minister and
a guy from the zombie show.

914
00:40:09,009 --> 00:40:11,311
I just love it when
he comes to the door holding

915
00:40:11,344 --> 00:40:12,979
those big signs.

916
00:40:13,013 --> 00:40:14,681
Really?

917
00:40:14,714 --> 00:40:17,250
Don't you think
it's just a little sappy and...

918
00:40:17,283 --> 00:40:18,585
kind of stalkery.

919
00:40:18,618 --> 00:40:21,554
No, it is romantic
and it's sweet.

920
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:23,223
Oh, come on, give it another
chance,

921
00:40:23,256 --> 00:40:24,924
I guarantee...

922
00:40:24,958 --> 00:40:27,160
it will melt your heart.

923
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:38,872
[sighs]

924
00:40:49,215 --> 00:40:50,216
[clicks tongue]

925
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,718
This is interesting.

926
00:40:54,287 --> 00:40:55,622
[paper rustling]

927
00:40:57,657 --> 00:40:58,658
Yeah.

928
00:41:04,731 --> 00:41:05,799
Yeah.

929
00:41:08,435 --> 00:41:10,070
[laughing]

930
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,738
- I think this border--
- There, there.

931
00:41:11,771 --> 00:41:12,772
Yeah, what do you think?

932
00:41:13,773 --> 00:41:15,141
[indistinct chatter]

933
00:41:18,211 --> 00:41:19,312
Is it too much?

934
00:41:19,346 --> 00:41:20,647
[sighs]
Damn it.

935
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,715
What?

936
00:41:23,216 --> 00:41:25,151
- What's wrong?
- I just--

937
00:41:25,185 --> 00:41:27,220
I lost another bid
for the VR goggles

938
00:41:27,253 --> 00:41:28,555
that Ari wants
for Christmas.

939
00:41:28,588 --> 00:41:30,256
What am I gonna do?
They're sold out everywhere.

940
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:32,826
- Really? Hmm.
- Yeah.

941
00:41:32,859 --> 00:41:34,994
Well, that might be because

942
00:41:35,095 --> 00:41:36,896
I bought the last pair?

943
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:38,998
Wait, you bought them?
Why?

944
00:41:39,099 --> 00:41:40,734
For you to give to Ari.

945
00:41:40,767 --> 00:41:41,968
I mean, I heard you
talking about

946
00:41:42,002 --> 00:41:44,170
how hard it was
to find them and...

947
00:41:45,772 --> 00:41:47,507
And you did that for me?

948
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,442
Of course I did.

949
00:41:49,476 --> 00:41:51,378
Gabi, I'd--

950
00:41:51,411 --> 00:41:53,279
I'd do anything for...

951
00:41:53,313 --> 00:41:55,115
Um, uh...

952
00:41:56,416 --> 00:41:58,752
Ladies and gentlemen,

953
00:41:58,785 --> 00:42:00,653
children of all ages,

954
00:42:00,687 --> 00:42:03,056
I have made my decision

955
00:42:03,056 --> 00:42:06,960
but first let me say that you
are all winners in my book.

956
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,361
[laughing]

957
00:42:08,395 --> 00:42:12,198
I should say on these
very trying times,

958
00:42:12,232 --> 00:42:14,467
you brought Christmas cheer.

959
00:42:14,501 --> 00:42:16,202
And that fills us all with joy.

960
00:42:18,071 --> 00:42:20,106
- Hear, hear!
- [cheering]

961
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:22,809
Now, there can
only be one champion.

962
00:42:24,477 --> 00:42:26,446
So the winners of this year's

963
00:42:26,479 --> 00:42:30,083
Brady Pub Christmas
Cookie Decorating...

964
00:42:31,217 --> 00:42:33,086
is...

965
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:34,120
Nick and Gabi!

966
00:42:34,154 --> 00:42:35,522
Ooh!
Nick, we won!

967
00:42:35,555 --> 00:42:36,756
[overlapping chatter]

968
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:37,757
[laughing]

969
00:42:37,791 --> 00:42:40,627
- We did it.
- We sure did.

970
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,295
And you make quite a team.

971
00:42:43,663 --> 00:42:44,698
[laughing]

972
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,201
[sighs]

973
00:42:48,234 --> 00:42:49,903
Yeah, yeah.

974
00:42:49,936 --> 00:42:51,438
I'll give it to him.

975
00:42:51,471 --> 00:42:53,106
Hey, what kind
of devilish judge

976
00:42:53,106 --> 00:42:54,874
doesn't pick
her own grandkids?

977
00:42:54,908 --> 00:42:57,110
Well, I calls them
like I sees them.

978
00:42:58,345 --> 00:43:00,780
In fact,

979
00:43:00,814 --> 00:43:04,551
Allie's gingerbread man
looks a lot like Tripp's.

980
00:43:04,584 --> 00:43:08,088
And yours looks
a lot like Chanel's.

981
00:43:09,189 --> 00:43:10,490
Hm.

982
00:43:10,523 --> 00:43:13,593
Maybe y'all should
have switched partners, hm?

983
00:43:33,747 --> 00:43:36,282
Let me help you with this,
you got a little--

984
00:43:36,316 --> 00:43:38,485
- [laughing]
- [door closes]

985
00:43:38,518 --> 00:43:40,120
[Nicole clears her throat]

986
00:43:40,153 --> 00:43:41,721
Look, Mommy,
we made a gingerbread man.

987
00:43:41,755 --> 00:43:43,089
Oh, wow.

988
00:43:43,089 --> 00:43:46,426
Oh, and got frosting
all over your new dress.

989
00:43:47,727 --> 00:43:48,461
I'm sorry.

990
00:43:48,495 --> 00:43:49,329
EJ: It's okay, honey.

991
00:43:49,362 --> 00:43:50,430
It'll come out in the wash.

992
00:43:50,463 --> 00:43:53,233
That is her answer
for everything.

993
00:43:53,266 --> 00:43:54,934
Can we talk about this
in private, please?

994
00:43:58,538 --> 00:44:00,106
Be right back, Syd.

995
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,541
Daddy is in trouble, ugh.

996
00:44:01,574 --> 00:44:02,776
[chuckles]

997
00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:03,910
You know what?

998
00:44:03,943 --> 00:44:05,345
I think I can get it out.

999
00:44:05,378 --> 00:44:07,681
Let me just see if
I can fix this real quick.

1000
00:44:07,714 --> 00:44:08,715
Yeah, look, see?

1001
00:44:08,748 --> 00:44:10,083
Yeah, ha! Perfect.

1002
00:44:10,116 --> 00:44:12,285
Perfect.

1003
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:16,056
Sami, can I tell you a secret?

1004
00:44:16,056 --> 00:44:17,424
Of course you can.

1005
00:44:19,059 --> 00:44:20,860
I wish you were my mommy.

1006
00:44:22,228 --> 00:44:23,730
Oh...

1007
00:44:29,069 --> 00:44:31,171
JOHN: Kristen,
what are you doing in there?

1008
00:44:31,204 --> 00:44:33,073
My favorite scene
is coming up.

1009
00:44:33,073 --> 00:44:34,374
Be right there!

1010
00:44:34,407 --> 00:44:35,542
God, I'm gonna need this

1011
00:44:35,575 --> 00:44:37,310
to get through the rest
of that movie.

1012
00:44:37,344 --> 00:44:38,745
[knocking on door]

1013
00:44:46,953 --> 00:44:47,921
[mouthing]
Shh.

1014
00:44:55,562 --> 00:44:57,630
What the world?

1015
00:44:57,664 --> 00:44:59,232
JOHN: Who's at the door?

1016
00:45:00,467 --> 00:45:01,601
SAY IT'S CAROLERS

1017
00:45:01,634 --> 00:45:02,635
It's carolers!

1018
00:45:08,742 --> 00:45:13,380
* O holy night, the stars
are brightly shining *

1019
00:45:13,413 --> 00:45:16,316
I'M SHOPPING AROUND
FOR A GIRLFRIEND

1020
00:45:16,349 --> 00:45:19,853
* It is the night
of out dear Savior's birth *

1021
00:45:19,886 --> 00:45:23,123
HERE ARE A FEW OPTIONS

1022
00:45:23,156 --> 00:45:26,393
* Long lay the world *

1023
00:45:26,426 --> 00:45:30,897
* In sin
and error pining *

1024
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:33,333
* 'Til He appeared and
the spirit felt its worth *

1025
00:45:33,366 --> 00:45:35,802
I'D RATHER BE WITH YOU

1026
00:45:37,537 --> 00:45:40,707
* A thrill of hope
the weary world rejoices *

1027
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,442
BUT TO YOU,
I'M JUST A HARD

1028
00:45:44,711 --> 00:45:47,580
* For yonder breaks

1029
00:45:47,614 --> 00:45:49,416
BODY (WHICH, FINE,
I'M OBVIOUSLY HOT)

1030
00:45:52,285 --> 00:45:55,188
* Fall on your knees *

1031
00:45:55,221 --> 00:45:57,223
BUT I HAVE TO SAY THIS

1032
00:45:58,591 --> 00:46:03,063
* O hear the angel voices *

1033
00:46:03,096 --> 00:46:06,366
I LOVE YOU, KRISTEN

1034
00:46:06,399 --> 00:46:09,903
* O night *

1035
00:46:09,936 --> 00:46:13,039

1036
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:16,443
PERHAPS ONE DAY
YOU'LL LOVE ME BACK?

1037
00:46:16,476 --> 00:46:20,313
* When Christ was born *

1038
00:46:20,347 --> 00:46:21,414
* O night... *

1039
00:46:21,448 --> 00:46:23,049
I'm sorry,

1040
00:46:23,049 --> 00:46:24,217
just can't.

1041
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:27,721
* Divine *

1042
00:46:27,754 --> 00:46:30,924
* O night *

1043
00:46:30,957 --> 00:46:33,293
* O night divine *

1044
00:46:33,326 --> 00:46:35,762
YOU MADE ME
THE HAPPIEST MAN ALIVE!

* [vocalizing] *

1046
00:46:40,834 --> 00:46:42,869
I UNDERSTAND

00:46:42,902 --> 00:46:47,440
* [vocalizing] *

1048
00:46:47,474 --> 00:46:49,943
GOODBYE

1049
00:46:49,976 --> 00:46:57,083
* Fall on your knees *

1050
00:46:57,117 --> 00:47:00,153
* Oh, hear the angel voices *

1051
00:47:00,186 --> 00:47:04,557
[sighs]

1052
00:47:04,591 --> 00:47:08,094
* O night *

1053
00:47:08,128 --> 00:47:11,031
* Divine *

1054
00:47:11,064 --> 00:47:14,567
* O night *

1055
00:47:14,601 --> 00:47:18,505
* When Christ was born *

1056
00:47:18,538 --> 00:47:22,709
* O night *

1057
00:47:22,742 --> 00:47:25,912
* Divine *

1058
00:47:25,945 --> 00:47:29,249
* O night *

1059
00:47:29,282 --> 00:47:33,787
* O night divine *

1060
00:47:37,624 --> 00:47:39,492
[yawning]

1061
00:47:41,895 --> 00:47:43,263
[sighs]

1062
00:47:43,296 --> 00:47:44,731
Wow.

1063
00:47:44,764 --> 00:47:46,066
That was fun,
wasn't it?

1064
00:47:48,101 --> 00:47:49,436
I think I'm gonna go upstairs

1065
00:47:49,469 --> 00:47:51,371
and wash my face,
put on some flannels

1066
00:47:51,404 --> 00:47:53,940
and watch my favorite
Christmas movie.

1067
00:47:53,973 --> 00:47:57,077
The-- the one with Hugh Grant.

1068
00:47:57,077 --> 00:47:58,912
Oh, my God.

1069
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,282
What is it?

1070
00:48:02,315 --> 00:48:03,450
Mom.

1071
00:48:04,851 --> 00:48:08,254
I think I have a way that I can
save the business after all.

1072
00:48:15,362 --> 00:48:19,032
* *

1073
00:48:28,441 --> 00:48:31,311
How did they find out
about that damn loophole?

1074
00:48:31,344 --> 00:48:32,746
No idea, boss.

1075
00:48:32,779 --> 00:48:33,847
Explain it to me again.

1076
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,315
[grunts]

1077
00:48:35,348 --> 00:48:39,052
Apparently,
a Salem law from 1965

1078
00:48:39,052 --> 00:48:42,455
states that any small
business owner

1079
00:48:42,489 --> 00:48:44,758
operating in
an historic district

1080
00:48:44,791 --> 00:48:46,493
for at least a year

1081
00:48:46,526 --> 00:48:47,927
has the right to buy out
their lease.

1082
00:48:49,129 --> 00:48:50,330
So that's it?

1083
00:48:50,363 --> 00:48:51,731
Price Town is dead
in the water?

1084
00:48:51,765 --> 00:48:54,868
Oh, hell, no, hell, no, Mary,

1085
00:48:54,901 --> 00:48:57,203
they only have until
midnight tonight

1086
00:48:57,237 --> 00:48:58,471
to raise the money

1087
00:48:58,505 --> 00:49:00,006
and those deadbeats
over there

1088
00:49:00,006 --> 00:49:01,374
they're barely
making ends meet.

1089
00:49:01,408 --> 00:49:05,478
So if they can't
scrounge up the cash,

1090
00:49:05,512 --> 00:49:07,247
it's eviction time in Salem.

1091
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,214
[laughing]

1092
00:49:08,248 --> 00:49:09,816
Full speed ahead!

1093
00:49:09,849 --> 00:49:12,185
[chuckling]

1094
00:49:12,218 --> 00:49:13,820
Oh, a Christmas Eve deadline.

1095
00:49:13,853 --> 00:49:15,121
Just like your script.

1096
00:49:15,155 --> 00:49:16,423
- Very meta.
- Yeah.

1097
00:49:16,456 --> 00:49:17,791
Gotta push on the climax,

1098
00:49:17,824 --> 00:49:19,526
Our characters
are running out of time.

1099
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:20,727
Ooh, and so are we.

1100
00:49:22,195 --> 00:49:24,030
SAMI: [clears throat]
Okay, everybody,

1101
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:25,899
thank you all for coming.

1102
00:49:25,932 --> 00:49:28,335
I know you'd rather
spend Christmas Eve

1103
00:49:28,368 --> 00:49:31,037
with your families but, um...

1104
00:49:31,037 --> 00:49:33,306
but we are running out of
time to save our businesses.

1105
00:49:34,908 --> 00:49:38,044
John, have you been
able to pull together enough

1106
00:49:38,078 --> 00:49:39,913
money to buy our leases?

1107
00:49:39,946 --> 00:49:41,614
Even pulling our resources

1108
00:49:41,648 --> 00:49:43,516
we're coming up short.

1109
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:44,951
So pooling was a mistake.

1110
00:49:45,051 --> 00:49:45,919
But maybe we can still save

1111
00:49:45,952 --> 00:49:47,220
a couple
of the businesses, right?

1112
00:49:47,253 --> 00:49:48,688
MARLENA: No, no.

1113
00:49:48,722 --> 00:49:51,057
We have to stick together.

1114
00:49:51,057 --> 00:49:53,059
It's all or nothing.

1115
00:49:53,059 --> 00:49:54,728
I have to agree with Marlena.

1116
00:49:56,296 --> 00:49:58,932
Couldn't you ask your mom to
give us an extension?

1117
00:49:58,965 --> 00:50:00,934
I can try.

1118
00:50:00,967 --> 00:50:02,602
But I doubt
she'll change her mind.

1119
00:50:02,635 --> 00:50:04,137
GABI: Damn it, you guys,
I mean,

1120
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:06,573
there must be a way to get
that money by midnight, we--

1121
00:50:06,606 --> 00:50:07,774
we can't just give up.

1122
00:50:07,807 --> 00:50:08,675
SAMI: You're right.

1123
00:50:08,708 --> 00:50:10,543
You are right, Gabi, we can't.

1124
00:50:11,678 --> 00:50:12,912
So...

1125
00:50:14,614 --> 00:50:15,949
I have an idea.

1126
00:50:21,521 --> 00:50:23,590
CHRISTMAS EVE
TALENT SHOW FUNDRAISER

1127
00:50:27,394 --> 00:50:29,162
So, what do you think?

1128
00:50:29,195 --> 00:50:30,397
How's it look?

1129
00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:31,998
Perfect.

1130
00:50:32,032 --> 00:50:33,700
You know, for someone
who's not a fan of Christmas,

1131
00:50:33,733 --> 00:50:35,068
you've certainly
gotten into the spirit.

1132
00:50:35,101 --> 00:50:36,136
[laughing]

1133
00:50:36,169 --> 00:50:37,570
I know, right?

1134
00:50:37,604 --> 00:50:38,772
I don't know
what's come over me.

1135
00:50:38,805 --> 00:50:40,206
[chuckles]

1136
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,208
So, do you think
this fundraiser

1137
00:50:42,242 --> 00:50:43,510
will get you over the line?

1138
00:50:43,543 --> 00:50:46,746
I hope so, that's our
last best shot.

1139
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:49,115
I talked to WXIR and
they're going to broadcast

1140
00:50:49,149 --> 00:50:51,317
the whole thing, so that'll
bring a lot more eyeballs too.

1141
00:50:51,351 --> 00:50:53,119
- That's great!
- Yeah.

1142
00:50:53,153 --> 00:50:54,854
And I'll donate
as much as I can.

1143
00:50:54,888 --> 00:50:56,690
Oh, no, EJ.
I'm not asking that.

1144
00:50:56,723 --> 00:50:58,858
No, no, no, it's my pleasure,

1145
00:50:58,892 --> 00:51:01,528
but unfortunately

1146
00:51:01,561 --> 00:51:05,165
all of DiMera's assets
are now temporarily frozen.

1147
00:51:05,198 --> 00:51:06,599
What?

1148
00:51:06,633 --> 00:51:08,234
What happened this time?

1149
00:51:08,268 --> 00:51:09,769
The SCC is after us again.

1150
00:51:09,803 --> 00:51:10,904
I'm sure it will blow over,

1151
00:51:10,937 --> 00:51:13,373
but not in time to donate
to your cause.

1152
00:51:13,406 --> 00:51:14,974
I see.

1153
00:51:15,075 --> 00:51:16,810
But I'm willing to do

1154
00:51:16,843 --> 00:51:18,712
whatever I can to--
to help out.

1155
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,781
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

1156
00:51:21,815 --> 00:51:25,852
Well, I'm really glad
that you say that because, um...

1157
00:51:25,885 --> 00:51:27,287
Do have a costume for you.

1158
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,122
Uh-- Costume?

1159
00:51:29,155 --> 00:51:30,423
[laughing]

1160
00:51:38,598 --> 00:51:41,101
I was told to pick up
my costume for the show.

1161
00:51:43,336 --> 00:51:46,106
We have to stop
meeting like this.

1162
00:51:46,106 --> 00:51:48,308
- What?
- Because of the suit and now--

1163
00:51:48,341 --> 00:51:50,243
- Here it is.
- Okay.

1164
00:51:50,276 --> 00:51:51,678
Uhm, you know?

1165
00:51:51,711 --> 00:51:53,513
I thought about what you said.

1166
00:51:53,546 --> 00:51:55,482
About, um,
expressing my feelings

1167
00:51:55,515 --> 00:51:56,950
for the woman that I love.

1168
00:51:56,983 --> 00:51:58,284
Yes.

1169
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:00,820
BRADY: And I decided
to take your advice.

1170
00:52:01,888 --> 00:52:03,089
And?

1171
00:52:03,123 --> 00:52:04,891
And she turned me down.

1172
00:52:06,393 --> 00:52:07,560
Flat.

1173
00:52:09,229 --> 00:52:11,965
Oh, I see, I'm so sorry.

1174
00:52:12,065 --> 00:52:13,967
Thank you.

1175
00:52:14,067 --> 00:52:16,803
I guess it's time for me
to just, you know, move on.

1176
00:52:18,271 --> 00:52:19,639
Yeah, but then you know, maybe

1177
00:52:19,673 --> 00:52:21,808
you and I
can hang out sometime.

1178
00:52:23,476 --> 00:52:24,644
BRADY: Oh, um...

1179
00:52:26,146 --> 00:52:28,882
Thanks, I'm--
I'm flattered, Gabi, but...

1180
00:52:28,915 --> 00:52:31,951
I really think we should keep
our relationship professional.

1181
00:52:31,985 --> 00:52:35,388
I mean we work for
rival companies, right?

1182
00:52:35,422 --> 00:52:37,157
Yeah, right, yeah, of course.

1183
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:38,825
But thank you, thank you.

1184
00:52:38,858 --> 00:52:40,226
Yeah.

1185
00:52:48,768 --> 00:52:49,969
Oh, my God.

1186
00:52:50,003 --> 00:52:51,471
I'm such an idiot.

1187
00:52:51,504 --> 00:52:52,372
Ugh!

1188
00:52:54,507 --> 00:52:56,343
No.

1189
00:52:56,376 --> 00:52:57,811
Gabi, you're wrong.

1190
00:52:57,844 --> 00:53:00,213
Brady Black is the idiot.

1191
00:53:01,548 --> 00:53:03,183
He doesn't deserve you.

1192
00:53:09,756 --> 00:53:10,890
[sighs]

1193
00:53:10,924 --> 00:53:12,459

[laughing]

1196
00:53:15,295 --> 00:53:16,663
Wow.

1197
00:53:16,696 --> 00:53:19,065
Everybody,
this is Allie and Chanel.

1198
00:53:19,065 --> 00:53:21,534
Co-owners of Sweet Bits.

1199
00:53:21,568 --> 00:53:23,436
Wow, that was fantastic.

1200
00:53:24,971 --> 00:53:27,307
What an interesting choice
to cover the Indigo Girls.

1201
00:53:28,775 --> 00:53:30,977
Well, I want to thank
all of you so much.

1202
00:53:31,077 --> 00:53:33,913
All of you out there
for being so generous.

1203
00:53:33,947 --> 00:53:35,415
[applause]

1204
00:53:35,448 --> 00:53:37,550
[chiming]
GOAL

1205
00:53:37,584 --> 00:53:39,986
But, as you can see, we haven't
reached our goal yet,

1206
00:53:40,086 --> 00:53:42,422
so, please keep
those donations coming.

1207
00:53:42,455 --> 00:53:44,691
Oh, give it up, honey!

1208
00:53:44,724 --> 00:53:46,459
It's almost midnight

1209
00:53:46,493 --> 00:53:48,661
and that meter is about
as dead as this mink.

1210
00:53:48,695 --> 00:53:51,231
You are never gonna stop
Price Town from happening.

1211
00:53:51,264 --> 00:53:53,400
Oh, the show isn't over yet.

1212
00:53:53,433 --> 00:53:54,668
PAULINA: I beg your pardon?

1213
00:53:55,735 --> 00:53:56,803
There's still one more act.

1214
00:53:56,836 --> 00:53:59,005
How do you know that?

1215
00:53:59,105 --> 00:54:00,040
Because I booked it.

1216
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:01,241
You did what?

1217
00:54:02,342 --> 00:54:03,943
Who do you think
tipped everyone off

1218
00:54:04,044 --> 00:54:06,146
about the loophole in the law?

1219
00:54:06,179 --> 00:54:09,249
You? How could you stab
me in the back, Mary?

1220
00:54:09,282 --> 00:54:11,685
After everything I've done
for you, Mary!

1221
00:54:11,718 --> 00:54:13,653
For the last time
my name is--

1222
00:54:13,687 --> 00:54:14,854
You know what?

1223
00:54:14,888 --> 00:54:17,357
Let's go with Mary,
but with an E and two Rs

1224
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:19,459
as in Merry Christmas.

1225
00:54:21,261 --> 00:54:22,328
If you don't mind...

1226
00:54:22,362 --> 00:54:23,329
- I don't mind at all.
- Thank you.

1227
00:54:23,363 --> 00:54:26,232
Ladies, gentlemen...

1228
00:54:26,266 --> 00:54:29,069
or however you identify,

1229
00:54:29,102 --> 00:54:30,337
I would like to present

1230
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:31,738
our grand finale,

1231
00:54:31,771 --> 00:54:34,607
the incomparable
We Three Queens.

[cheering and applause]

1233
00:54:38,678 --> 00:54:40,914
Please welcome to the stage

1234

Ow!

1238
00:54:50,457 --> 00:54:53,626

1240
00:54:55,195 --> 00:54:57,497
Oh, okay, okay,
nice- nice try.

1241
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:58,264
Yeah.

1242
00:54:58,298 --> 00:54:59,299
What?

1243
00:54:59,332 --> 00:55:00,800
We need a grand finale.

1244
00:55:00,834 --> 00:55:02,869
That's not what I meant
and you know it.

1245
00:55:04,571 --> 00:55:05,839
Fine.

1246
00:55:07,607 --> 00:55:09,042
Here you go.

1247
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:16,383
Amanda Bottom!

And last
but certainly not least,

1251
00:55:26,526 --> 00:55:28,628
the belle of the ball

1252
00:55:28,661 --> 00:55:30,196
with the big blue eyes

1253
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:33,233
Miss Bullinda Chinashop.

1255
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,242

[cheering and applause]

1277
00:57:10,563 --> 00:57:13,466
Ha, close, but no cigar.

1278
00:57:18,104 --> 00:57:20,540
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1279
00:57:20,573 --> 00:57:22,275
No, we are not finished yet,

1280
00:57:22,308 --> 00:57:24,144
So, you got a gander
at us girls

1281
00:57:24,177 --> 00:57:26,746
but now it's time for you
to check out the boys,

1282
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:28,815
ladies and gentlemen,

1283
00:57:28,848 --> 00:57:32,419
give it up for
Salem's Sexy Santa.

1284
00:57:32,452 --> 00:57:34,387

* I like it *
* Join the party *

1306
00:58:50,697 --> 00:58:52,499
You know, you should know
that I always wondered

1307
00:58:52,532 --> 00:58:54,401
why aren't the two
of you a couple.

1308
00:58:54,434 --> 00:58:56,903
What? No, Nick is my
friend, I don't--

1309
00:58:56,936 --> 00:58:57,904
I don't see him like that.

1310
00:58:57,937 --> 00:58:59,072
[laughing]

1311
00:58:59,072 --> 00:59:01,708

[inaudible]

1315
00:59:09,749 --> 00:59:11,117
I can't believe
that perfect guy

1316
00:59:11,151 --> 00:59:13,086
has been under
my nose the whole time.

1317
00:59:14,821 --> 00:59:16,222
* [vocalizing] *

I-- I was thinking

1319
00:59:19,659 --> 00:59:22,362
that maybe Johnny and me...

1320
00:59:22,395 --> 00:59:24,097
I know.

1321
00:59:24,130 --> 00:59:25,265
* Come on *

[cheering and applause]

1336
01:00:11,444 --> 01:00:12,212
JOHN: Great job!

1337
01:00:12,245 --> 01:00:14,114
SAMI: We did it!

1338
01:00:14,147 --> 01:00:16,349
Mom, we got enough to save
the Horton Town Square

1339
01:00:16,383 --> 01:00:18,418
and the Brady Pub is saved!

1340
01:00:18,451 --> 01:00:19,185
Oh!

1341
01:00:21,321 --> 01:00:23,056
Thank you,
thank you so much!

1342
01:00:28,128 --> 01:00:29,496
What the--?

1343
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:48,248
I can't believe
she pulled this off.

1344
01:00:48,281 --> 01:00:50,183
Oh, you've got to be
so proud of your daughter.

1345
01:00:50,216 --> 01:00:52,152
I am, I am, I am.

1346
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,890
Don't you-- don't you want
to go find Kristen?

1347
01:00:56,923 --> 01:00:58,224
I'm not sure where she is,

1348
01:00:58,258 --> 01:00:59,859
but you'd want to tell her
the good news, won't you?

1349
01:00:59,893 --> 01:01:02,295
Well, to be honest,

1350
01:01:02,328 --> 01:01:04,597
I'm beginning to wonder
if she even cares.

1351
01:01:06,766 --> 01:01:09,502
* O holy night *

1352
01:01:09,869 --> 01:01:14,307
* The stars are
brightly shining *

1353
01:01:14,341 --> 01:01:15,508
* It is the night
of our dear Savior's birth *

1354
01:01:15,542 --> 01:01:18,812
I LOVE YOU, KRISTEN

1355
01:01:21,348 --> 01:01:23,650
John was right.

1356
01:01:23,683 --> 01:01:25,251
This is the best part.

1357
01:01:25,285 --> 01:01:28,588
* Sin and error pining *

01:01:28,621 --> 01:01:30,090
[indistinct chattering]

1359
01:01:32,258 --> 01:01:35,095
Oh, my God.

1360
01:01:35,095 --> 01:01:36,563
You were amazing.

1361
01:01:42,836 --> 01:01:44,604
[chuckling]

1362
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:47,874
Gabi.

1363
01:01:47,907 --> 01:01:49,275
Is this real?

1364
01:01:50,877 --> 01:01:53,480
I've been pining for
the wrong Santa the entire time.

1365
01:01:53,513 --> 01:01:55,248
I don't know
what I've been thinking.

1366
01:01:59,953 --> 01:02:00,820
EJ: You did it, Samantha.

1367
01:02:00,854 --> 01:02:01,955
This is all because of you.

1368
01:02:02,055 --> 01:02:03,823
Well, I had a lot of help

1369
01:02:03,857 --> 01:02:05,725
and I'm just so grateful.

1370
01:02:05,759 --> 01:02:08,895
I mean, you know, to everyone.

1371
01:02:08,928 --> 01:02:11,865
Oh, I should give you
back your pants.

1372
01:02:11,898 --> 01:02:12,799
[laughing]
Thank you.

1373
01:02:12,832 --> 01:02:15,402
And you should be happy too,

1374
01:02:15,435 --> 01:02:17,070
because you deserve it.

1375
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:18,304
Thank you, EJ.

1376
01:02:18,338 --> 01:02:19,606
Thank you so much.

1377
01:02:19,639 --> 01:02:21,207
You're welcome.

1378
01:02:32,452 --> 01:02:35,722
You know, I don't think this
night could be any more perfect.

1379
01:02:38,858 --> 01:02:41,094
John, it's snowing.

1380
01:02:41,094 --> 01:02:42,595
- What?
- [gasps]

1381
01:02:51,905 --> 01:02:54,708
Doesn't this place have a roof?

1382
01:02:56,810 --> 01:02:59,145
It's a Christmas miracle.

1383
01:03:22,569 --> 01:03:24,270
Well, Dad, we did it.

1384
01:03:24,304 --> 01:03:26,406
I wired the money
just in time.

1385
01:03:26,439 --> 01:03:28,308
The Brady Pub is here to stay.

1386
01:03:29,709 --> 01:03:31,778
But you know that, don't you?

1387
01:03:31,811 --> 01:03:33,213
Because you were here

1388
01:03:33,246 --> 01:03:35,215
looking out for me
the whole time, weren't you?

1389
01:03:35,248 --> 01:03:36,616
[door opens]

1390
01:03:38,918 --> 01:03:41,421
Sami Brady, you and I are going
to get something straight.

1391
01:03:41,454 --> 01:03:42,989
What now, Nicole?

1392
01:03:43,089 --> 01:03:45,358
I saw you uglying
my husband earlier.

1393
01:03:45,392 --> 01:03:46,693
Uglying, really?

1394
01:03:46,726 --> 01:03:49,329
Yes and you're gonna
stay away from him.

1395
01:03:49,362 --> 01:03:50,597
And while you're at it,

1396
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:52,799
stay away from my daughter, too.
[door slams]

1397
01:03:52,832 --> 01:03:54,200
EJ: Except she isn't
your daughter, is she, Nicole?

1398
01:03:55,168 --> 01:03:56,302
What?

1399
01:03:56,336 --> 01:03:57,804
What are you
talking about?

1400
01:03:57,837 --> 01:03:59,806
I just had a talk
with Rafe Hernandez.

1401
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:01,941
The man is a self-righteous
Neanderthal

1402
01:04:02,042 --> 01:04:03,543
but he uncovered
a great injustice.

1403
01:04:05,278 --> 01:04:06,179
What are you saying?

1404
01:04:06,212 --> 01:04:07,580
Samantha.

1405
01:04:08,948 --> 01:04:11,084
Our child didn't die
all those years back.

1406
01:04:13,186 --> 01:04:14,888
Nicole switched the babies.

1407
01:04:14,921 --> 01:04:16,523
What?

1408
01:04:16,556 --> 01:04:18,792
Sydney is your daughter,

1409
01:04:18,825 --> 01:04:20,894
not Nicole's.

1410
01:04:20,927 --> 01:04:22,162
My daughter.

1411
01:04:22,195 --> 01:04:24,731
No, no, that is not true.

1412
01:04:24,764 --> 01:04:26,633
Sydney is my daughter.

1413
01:04:28,902 --> 01:04:30,370
She's my daughter.

1414
01:04:32,072 --> 01:04:33,239
No.

1415
01:04:33,273 --> 01:04:34,441
Oh!

1416
01:04:37,577 --> 01:04:39,412
Say it.

1417
01:04:39,446 --> 01:04:41,815
Sydney...

1418
01:04:41,848 --> 01:04:44,718
is EJ's and my daughter,

1419
01:04:44,751 --> 01:04:46,086
isn't she?

1420
01:04:48,421 --> 01:04:49,356
No.

1421
01:04:49,389 --> 01:04:50,690
Oh!

1422
01:04:50,724 --> 01:04:51,958
Say it, Nicole!

1423
01:04:53,193 --> 01:04:55,362
"She's Sami's child."

1424
01:04:55,395 --> 01:04:57,163
Sydney is mine

1425
01:04:57,197 --> 01:05:00,033
and I'm gonna
make you say it.

1426
01:05:06,106 --> 01:05:07,374
Sydney...

1427
01:05:09,075 --> 01:05:10,043
[sniffles]

1428
01:05:10,043 --> 01:05:11,778
Sydney is yours.

1429
01:05:15,482 --> 01:05:16,649
[gasps]

1430
01:05:18,585 --> 01:05:20,553
[breathing heavily]

1431
01:05:22,555 --> 01:05:23,923
Horton's winding down?

1432
01:05:23,957 --> 01:05:25,425
Is it?

1433
01:05:25,458 --> 01:05:26,960
I barely noticed.

1434
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:28,361
What do you want to do now?

1435
01:05:29,329 --> 01:05:30,663
We could, uh...

1436
01:05:31,664 --> 01:05:33,333
Go back to my place

1437
01:05:33,366 --> 01:05:36,369
and watch the Griswolds

1438
01:05:36,403 --> 01:05:38,405
or we could
watch Bruce Willis

1439
01:05:38,438 --> 01:05:40,407
kill a bunch of terrorists
in his bare feet.

1440
01:05:42,642 --> 01:05:46,446
I thought "Die Hard"
wasn't Christmas movie.

1441
01:05:46,479 --> 01:05:48,081
You know, I'm starting
to see things

1442
01:05:48,081 --> 01:05:49,482
in a whole new light.

1443
01:05:54,087 --> 01:05:57,157
So, this is...

1444
01:05:57,190 --> 01:05:58,792
Awkward?

1445
01:05:58,825 --> 01:06:00,226
It doesn't have to be.

1446
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:01,828
Yeah, she's right, you know?

1447
01:06:01,861 --> 01:06:04,030
I-- I think we'll
all be happier this way.

1448
01:06:04,064 --> 01:06:05,465
TRIPP: I mean, we're finally
matched with the person

1449
01:06:05,498 --> 01:06:07,734
we're meant to be with,
don't you think?

1450
01:06:10,070 --> 01:06:11,204
Uh-huh.

1451
01:06:12,272 --> 01:06:13,340
Right, Dupree?

1452
01:06:14,874 --> 01:06:16,343
Yeah, Horton.

1453
01:06:16,376 --> 01:06:17,510
Totally.

1454
01:06:18,878 --> 01:06:21,081
LEO: Hello, Historical
Society guy.

1455
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:27,053
Mr. Stark, you know you did
a wonderful thing tonight.

1456
01:06:27,053 --> 01:06:29,556
I was pleasantly surprised
to see you in the show.

1457
01:06:29,589 --> 01:06:31,191
Really, why?

1458
01:06:31,224 --> 01:06:32,826
Paulina convinced
somebody from the City

1459
01:06:32,859 --> 01:06:34,627
to approve her plans,
I was worried it was you.

1460
01:06:34,661 --> 01:06:36,062
No, not me.

1461
01:06:36,062 --> 01:06:37,364
Mm.

1462
01:06:37,397 --> 01:06:38,865
I wonder who helped her, then.

1463
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:43,403
If that wasn't so
humiliating,

1464
01:06:43,436 --> 01:06:45,271
my plans foiled

1465
01:06:45,305 --> 01:06:48,441
by a drag show,
of all things.

1466
01:06:48,475 --> 01:06:50,677
WOMAN: I gave it my best shot.

1467
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:52,245
I called in all my favors

1468
01:06:52,278 --> 01:06:53,980
to get that variance for you.

1469
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:56,082
Too bad it was all for nothing.

1470
01:06:56,116 --> 01:06:59,519
Well, at least you don't have
to keep running that stupid inn.

1471
01:06:59,552 --> 01:07:01,021
Not to mention,
I think I've blown

1472
01:07:01,021 --> 01:07:03,723
my one chance
to real happiness.

1473
01:07:06,126 --> 01:07:08,461
Seems I had
you pegged all wrong.

1474
01:07:08,495 --> 01:07:10,430
You and the rest
of the human race.

1475
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:12,932
Seriously, you should
be proud of yourself.

1476
01:07:13,033 --> 01:07:14,401
You helped to save the town.

1477
01:07:14,434 --> 01:07:16,169
I did, didn't I?

1478
01:07:16,202 --> 01:07:18,738
May I ask, what made you
change your tune?

1479
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:23,643
Honestly, it was that
passionate speech you gave me

1480
01:07:23,677 --> 01:07:27,414
about tradition and some things
being more important than money.

1481
01:07:27,447 --> 01:07:29,082
I didn't think
you were listening.

1482
01:07:29,115 --> 01:07:30,517
Not listening?

1483
01:07:30,550 --> 01:07:33,720
Honey, I'm gonna needlepoint
that speech into a pillow.

1484
01:07:33,753 --> 01:07:36,056
[laughing]
Well, I'm flattered.

1485
01:07:37,090 --> 01:07:38,224
Somehow you got through to me

1486
01:07:38,258 --> 01:07:40,593
in a way nobody else ever has.

1487
01:07:40,627 --> 01:07:42,228
Can't quite explain why.

1488
01:07:43,296 --> 01:07:44,898
Merry Christmas, Leo.

1489
01:07:54,541 --> 01:07:56,343
This town doesn't deserve you.

1490
01:08:02,449 --> 01:08:04,084
You came here to gloat?

1491
01:08:04,117 --> 01:08:07,821
I came here to invite you
to Christmas brunch.

1492
01:08:07,854 --> 01:08:11,624
Me and Johnny
and Allie and Tripp

1493
01:08:11,658 --> 01:08:14,060
we're calling it
"A Very Swappy Christmas."

1494
01:08:15,161 --> 01:08:17,897
You want me there
after I tried to evict you?

1495
01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:21,701
Well, you're an awful Grinch.

1496
01:08:21,735 --> 01:08:23,803
But you're still my mom.

1497
01:08:23,837 --> 01:08:26,239
And I know there's a great
big heart in there somewhere.

1498
01:08:27,674 --> 01:08:28,708
I love you, baby.

1499
01:08:28,742 --> 01:08:30,310
[chuckles]

1500
01:08:30,343 --> 01:08:31,478
I love you, too, Mama/

1501
01:08:31,511 --> 01:08:33,046
- Oh...
- Merry Christmas.

1502
01:08:33,046 --> 01:08:35,882
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1503
01:08:38,318 --> 01:08:40,053
Did Santa come?

1504
01:08:40,053 --> 01:08:41,621
Is it time to open presents?

1505
01:08:41,654 --> 01:08:42,589
[chuckles]

1506
01:08:42,622 --> 01:08:43,857
Oh, yeah, my darling.

1507
01:08:47,327 --> 01:08:51,064
But we do have a gift for you.

1508
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:54,868
SYDNEY: Sami?

1509
01:08:54,901 --> 01:08:57,337
What are you doing
in my room?

1510
01:08:57,370 --> 01:08:58,838
Well.

1511
01:09:01,107 --> 01:09:02,676
Sydney...

1512
01:09:02,709 --> 01:09:04,911
your Christmas wish...

1513
01:09:05,011 --> 01:09:06,079
has come true.

1514
01:09:08,314 --> 01:09:09,783
I'm your mommy.

1515
01:09:09,816 --> 01:09:11,785
What?

1516
01:09:11,818 --> 01:09:13,520
You are?

1517
01:09:13,553 --> 01:09:14,888
She is?

1518
01:09:14,921 --> 01:09:15,822
She is.

1519
01:09:17,223 --> 01:09:19,526
Nothing could make me happier.

1520
01:09:19,559 --> 01:09:22,295
I love Christmas, mommy.

1521
01:09:22,328 --> 01:09:23,730
And I love you.

1522
01:09:23,763 --> 01:09:26,232
Oh, sweetheart,
I love you so much.

1523
01:09:28,234 --> 01:09:29,369
[sniffles]

1524
01:09:31,204 --> 01:09:32,405
[laughing]

1525
01:09:36,309 --> 01:09:37,577
- Excuse me.
- Uh, wait.

1526
01:09:41,581 --> 01:09:42,449
Hi.

1527
01:09:42,482 --> 01:09:43,516
Hi.

1528
01:09:45,919 --> 01:09:47,654
I can't stop
thinking about that...

1529
01:09:47,687 --> 01:09:49,656
little performance
you gave last night.

1530
01:09:52,625 --> 01:09:54,961
Well, we've already
established that you...

1531
01:09:55,061 --> 01:09:57,931
like my hard body.

1532
01:09:57,964 --> 01:09:59,666
- I do.
- Hm.

1533
01:09:59,699 --> 01:10:02,802
I do, but it-- no,
it was more what you said.

1534
01:10:02,836 --> 01:10:04,704
Actually, what you wrote.

1535
01:10:04,738 --> 01:10:05,839
And...

1536
01:10:07,307 --> 01:10:09,175
I just want to tell you
that I love you, too.

1537
01:10:12,812 --> 01:10:15,448
- You do?
- I do.

1538
01:10:15,482 --> 01:10:17,150
I mean,
I really, really do.

1539
01:10:18,752 --> 01:10:21,121
And I want to be with you.

1540
01:10:21,154 --> 01:10:22,355
For real.

1541
01:10:23,890 --> 01:10:25,458
If you still have me.

1542
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:28,695
Oh, God, Kristen.

1543
01:10:41,975 --> 01:10:43,076
Come on.

1544
01:10:43,109 --> 01:10:44,344
[grunts]

1545
01:10:44,377 --> 01:10:46,212
Such a big girl!

1546
01:10:46,246 --> 01:10:48,648
Hold on, let me
get the bed ready.

1547
01:10:48,682 --> 01:10:50,417
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

1548
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:51,918
Let's take those slippers

1549
01:10:55,288 --> 01:10:57,090
There you go.

1550
01:10:57,123 --> 01:10:58,858
Now...

1551
01:10:58,892 --> 01:11:00,493
You close your eyes

1552
01:11:00,527 --> 01:11:03,063
so that Santa
can deliver your presents.

1553
01:11:04,364 --> 01:11:05,832
And we'll see you
in the morning.

1554
01:11:09,336 --> 01:11:10,503
[sighs]

1555
01:11:16,076 --> 01:11:17,544
[EJ exhales]

1556
01:11:29,422 --> 01:11:30,957
I can't believe it.

1557
01:11:30,990 --> 01:11:33,560
I can't believe
she's really mine.

1558
01:11:33,593 --> 01:11:36,363
She's our child, Samantha.

1559
01:11:38,098 --> 01:11:39,466
I meant to be a family.

1560
01:11:41,801 --> 01:11:45,305
When I fix all this mess
with Nicole,

1561
01:11:45,338 --> 01:11:46,806
maybe you and I can...

1562
01:11:49,676 --> 01:11:52,278
Maybe you and I could...

1563
01:12:11,064 --> 01:12:12,565
What a Christmas.

1564
01:12:15,869 --> 01:12:17,671
And the awful truth came out.

1565
01:12:19,239 --> 01:12:20,407
Oh, God.

1566
01:12:21,408 --> 01:12:23,376
Please, forgive me.

1567
01:12:28,081 --> 01:12:30,183
You know what?
I take that back.

1568
01:12:30,216 --> 01:12:33,286
After what I did to Sydney
and EJ and Sami,

1569
01:12:33,319 --> 01:12:35,088
I don't deserve forgiveness.

1570
01:12:55,475 --> 01:12:57,410
MAN: Everyone
deserves forgiveness.

1571
01:13:03,883 --> 01:13:05,218
[gasps]

1572
01:13:15,495 --> 01:13:16,629
[door opens]

1573
01:13:19,299 --> 01:13:20,567
Oof.

1574
01:13:22,068 --> 01:13:23,069
Oh...

1575
01:13:23,069 --> 01:13:24,270
John?

1576
01:13:27,140 --> 01:13:28,508
Ah, hey.

1577
01:13:31,978 --> 01:13:33,880
Is everything all right?

1578
01:13:40,787 --> 01:13:42,355
Kristen and I we're...

1579
01:13:43,957 --> 01:13:45,558
We're gonna get a divorce.

1580
01:13:46,826 --> 01:13:49,229
Oh.

1581
01:13:49,262 --> 01:13:51,131
I'm so sorry.

1582
01:13:53,967 --> 01:13:55,168
Thank you, Doc.

1583
01:13:58,204 --> 01:13:59,673
Doc.

1584
01:14:02,275 --> 01:14:03,943
You haven't
called me that in years.

1585
01:14:06,713 --> 01:14:08,815
No, I guess I haven't.

1586
01:14:14,554 --> 01:14:16,856
Would you like to sit
with me for a little bit?

1587
01:14:19,959 --> 01:14:21,294
I would.

1588
01:14:49,089 --> 01:14:50,857
[clock chiming]

1589
01:14:55,395 --> 01:14:57,097
Well, look at that.

1590
01:14:59,265 --> 01:15:00,500
All right...

1591
01:15:04,437 --> 01:15:06,272
Merry Christmas, Doc.

1592
01:15:11,077 --> 01:15:12,712
Merry Christmas, John.

1593
01:15:29,596 --> 01:15:32,332

in front of the roaring fire,

1594

"The end."

1598
01:15:42,108 --> 01:15:44,077
And?

1599
01:15:44,077 --> 01:15:46,246
Just under the wire.

1600
01:15:46,279 --> 01:15:48,448
All that's left
is to hit "send."

1601
01:15:48,481 --> 01:15:49,349
Shall we--

1602
01:15:49,382 --> 01:15:50,083
Shall we do it together?

1603
01:15:50,083 --> 01:15:51,418
Yes, please.

1604
01:15:53,119 --> 01:15:54,454
[chuckles]
Okay.

1605
01:15:54,487 --> 01:15:55,722
Thank you so much.

1606
01:15:55,755 --> 01:15:57,157
Thank you so much for
helping me with this.

1607
01:15:57,190 --> 01:15:58,291
Of course.

1608
01:15:58,324 --> 01:16:00,193
We just, like,
completed a miracle.

1609
01:16:00,226 --> 01:16:01,428
Yeah, and you know what?

1610
01:16:01,461 --> 01:16:04,564
We got to spend
Christmas in Salem.

1611
01:16:06,032 --> 01:16:07,734
Even if we couldn't
actually be there in person,

1612
01:16:07,767 --> 01:16:10,170
You know,
writing all that...

1613
01:16:10,203 --> 01:16:11,771
it made me miss it.

1614
01:16:11,805 --> 01:16:12,839
You know?

1615
01:16:12,872 --> 01:16:14,074
Miss them.

1616
01:16:15,141 --> 01:16:16,376
Yeah, me, too.

1617
01:16:17,477 --> 01:16:18,678
We'll have to visit soon.

1618
01:16:21,414 --> 01:16:22,549
Hm.

1619
01:16:22,582 --> 01:16:23,850
It's midnight here, too.

1620
01:16:26,353 --> 01:16:28,254
Merry Christmas, honey.

1621
01:16:28,288 --> 01:16:29,789
Merry Christmas...

01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:30,924
