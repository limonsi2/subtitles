Come on.

00:02:55,931 --> 00:02:57,620
Hey.

15
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,482
- You have to go pee?

16
00:02:59,551 --> 00:03:01,827
Okay, here.

17
00:03:01,862 --> 00:03:03,827
Go pee and brush your teeth.

18
00:03:03,862 --> 00:03:05,379
Um, not that shirt.

19
00:03:05,413 --> 00:03:06,344
What shirt do you want?

00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:07,206
Red one.

21
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:08,517
Okay, go pee

00:03:08,551 --> 00:03:10,655

okay?

23

Hurry up!

Here you go, bud, red shirt.

27
00:03:28,482 --> 00:03:29,551
I'm gonna get our lunches
ready,

28
00:03:29,586 --> 00:03:30,896
do you need help
with your shoes?

29
00:03:30,965 --> 00:03:33,310
- No.
- Okay.

30
00:03:33,344 --> 00:03:34,965
Hurry up, come on we gotta go.

31
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,551
Hey.

32
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,551
Do you need a snack
before daycare?

33
00:03:49,586 --> 00:03:51,241
- Yeah, cereal.
- No time for cereal.

34
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,344
How about a banana?

35
00:03:52,344 --> 00:03:54,000
- No, juice.
- Juice.

36
00:03:55,655 --> 00:03:56,655
GREYSON:
There you are.

00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,689
Lunch.

38
00:04:00,724 --> 00:04:01,448
Lunch.

39
00:04:01,482 --> 00:04:03,586
Alright, let's go.

40
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,034
JAMES:
Don't forget our book.

41
00:04:05,068 --> 00:04:06,413
Oh, right.

42
00:04:15,965 --> 00:04:17,379
Alright, come on, let's go.

43
00:04:41,068 --> 00:04:42,896
- GREYSON: Morning.
- Good morning, James.

44
00:04:42,896 --> 00:04:44,620
Good morning.

45
00:04:44,655 --> 00:04:46,482
GREYSON:
Hey, I put some breakfast up
in here, too.

46
00:04:46,551 --> 00:04:49,379
He wanted cereal,
but we didn't have time so...

47
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:50,241
No worries.

48
00:04:50,275 --> 00:04:53,413
Maggie, can you put this
with the rest?

49
00:04:53,448 --> 00:04:54,551
MAGGIE:
Of course.

50
00:04:57,586 --> 00:05:00,793
Who's picking him up
this afternoon?

51
00:05:00,827 --> 00:05:01,931
Your mom's gonna com
pick you up later.

52
00:05:01,965 --> 00:05:03,862
That'll be fun, huh?

53
00:05:03,931 --> 00:05:05,965
I want you to come get me.

54
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,586
I know you do,
but it's just gonna be

55
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,620
for a couple of days.

56
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,689
I promise.

57
00:05:13,965 --> 00:05:15,103
SARAH:
You should go.

58
00:05:15,137 --> 00:05:16,655
- Don't wanna be late.
- Okay.

59
00:05:16,655 --> 00:05:17,448
Alright, have fun today, bud.

60
00:05:17,482 --> 00:05:18,586
Thank you.

61
00:05:35,448 --> 00:05:37,137
Fuck!

62
00:05:49,793 --> 00:05:51,000
JOHN:
Yes, this is Tech Fix.

63
00:05:53,965 --> 00:05:55,931
- Good morning.
- : Morning, Zoey.

64
00:05:55,965 --> 00:05:58,379
- How are you?
- Late.

65
00:05:58,448 --> 00:06:00,137
JOHN:
Yes, like I instructed you
to use.

66
00:06:08,689 --> 00:06:09,689
Morning.

67
00:06:12,931 --> 00:06:15,586
You're late.

68
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,103
I know I just had to drop
the kid off on my--

69
00:06:17,172 --> 00:06:19,000
Fourth time this month.

70
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:21,931
I know.

71
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,862
So what are we doin' about it?

72
00:06:22,896 --> 00:06:23,862
I'm working on it.

73
00:06:23,862 --> 00:06:25,551
And?

74
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,931
And it's just hard, because
I have to get the kid ready,

75
00:06:27,965 --> 00:06:29,448
and I have to drive him
all the way over to daycare.

76
00:06:29,517 --> 00:06:30,862
Yeah, you gotta get
the kid ready,

77
00:06:30,896 --> 00:06:32,172
you gotta take him to daycare.

78
00:06:32,206 --> 00:06:34,689
"I got to, I got to--",
look, I don't care.

79
00:06:34,689 --> 00:06:36,206
We all have problems, okay?

80
00:06:36,206 --> 00:06:38,448
But we all manage to get here
on time

81
00:06:38,517 --> 00:06:40,655
and I don't want
any more excuses, alright?

82
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:42,206
I'm sorry, it's just--

83
00:06:42,241 --> 00:06:45,517
Grey, just say "alright".

84
00:06:45,517 --> 00:06:48,586
No more excuses, got it?

85
00:06:48,655 --> 00:06:49,689
Alright.

86
00:06:53,827 --> 00:06:56,000
Fuckin' animal, calm down,
we're tryin' to work here.

87
00:06:57,931 --> 00:06:59,448
Good morning.
Thank you for calling Tech Fix.

88
00:06:59,517 --> 00:07:01,068
My name is Greyson.

89
00:07:01,103 --> 00:07:03,103
How can I make you happy
this morning?

90
00:07:03,103 --> 00:07:04,137
Hey, guys!

91
00:07:04,137 --> 00:07:05,620
Kate and I are making a run
to Anthem Coffee.

92
00:07:05,655 --> 00:07:07,172
Does anybody want anything?

93
00:07:07,241 --> 00:07:08,965
- Jim?
- No.

94
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,172
Hey, let me get something.

95
00:07:10,241 --> 00:07:11,620
Hey.
What do you want, John?

96
00:07:11,655 --> 00:07:13,758
Um, we got a caramel macchiato.

97
00:07:13,793 --> 00:07:16,103
- What size?
- Uh, grande.

98
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,068
Thanks.

99
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,965
Go strong with the sugar.

100
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,896
BRODY:
Yeah, Zoey, can I get
a white chocolate mocha?

101
00:07:20,931 --> 00:07:21,965
Venti.

102
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,103
Thanks, Brody.

103
00:07:23,103 --> 00:07:25,586
Oh, I bet it tastes like shit.

104
00:07:25,586 --> 00:07:26,586
Hey, Grey.

105
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,793
Do you want any coffee?

106
00:07:28,827 --> 00:07:32,103
- I gotta pass, thanks.
- You sure?

107
00:07:32,137 --> 00:07:33,793
Give the guy a break, Zoey.

108
00:07:33,793 --> 00:07:36,758
He's a loser tryin' to support
a kid on $12 an hour.

109
00:07:36,793 --> 00:07:38,827
He can't afford coffee.

110
00:07:39,965 --> 00:07:41,068
That.

111
00:07:45,275 --> 00:07:46,620
You're an asshole.

112
00:07:46,655 --> 00:07:48,000
You say that now.

113
00:07:49,965 --> 00:07:52,586
Fucking don't.

114
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,551
ERIC:
Who's in there?

115
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,827
Yeah?

116
00:08:10,862 --> 00:08:13,344
Is that you, Grey?

117
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:15,172
GREYSON:
Yeah.

118
00:08:15,172 --> 00:08:17,000
Dude, you better not be
jerkin' off in there.

119
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,620
Fuck no.

120
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,827
ERIC:
Come on.

121
00:08:53,068 --> 00:08:54,275
All yours.

122
00:09:01,413 --> 00:09:02,448
-

123
00:09:02,448 --> 00:09:04,758
TRENT:
Yeah, thank you for calling
Tech Fix.

124
00:09:04,793 --> 00:09:07,103
Mmhmm.

125
00:09:10,103 --> 00:09:12,275
I guarantee you.

126
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:14,241
Okay.

127
00:09:14,241 --> 00:09:16,379
Mmhmm, yes, yes,
it's great to know.

128
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,310
Alright, chop-chop, teammate.

129
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:21,758
Get back to work, okay?

130
00:09:21,758 --> 00:09:23,413
We're losin' time
and not makin' a dime.

131
00:09:23,448 --> 00:09:25,379
Grey, where are you goin'?

132
00:09:25,413 --> 00:09:26,586
I just gotta talk to Zoey for--

133
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,310
Look, you should've taken
care of it during lunch, okay?

134
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:29,724
Instead of jerkin' off
in the bathroom?

135
00:09:29,758 --> 00:09:30,965
- Yeah.

136
00:09:31,034 --> 00:09:33,379
Oh, speaking of--
dropped your porn in there.

137
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:34,724
It's not porn.

138
00:09:34,724 --> 00:09:35,896
Yeah, I don't care, man.

139
00:09:35,931 --> 00:09:37,206
I care about the environment.

140
00:09:40,827 --> 00:09:42,862
Come on, Zoe,
you're slower than mud.

141
00:09:42,896 --> 00:09:44,068
Let's go.

142
00:09:44,068 --> 00:09:46,068
Happy hour only lasts
till 6:00, you know?

143
00:09:46,068 --> 00:09:47,206
Right behind you.

144
00:09:59,241 --> 00:10:01,413
BARNES:
Hey.

145
00:10:01,448 --> 00:10:03,620
- You wanna go out Saturday?
- No.

146
00:10:03,689 --> 00:10:04,724
Why not?

147
00:10:04,758 --> 00:10:05,931
What's the problem?

148
00:10:05,965 --> 00:10:07,758
The fact that you don't know
why not.

149
00:10:07,793 --> 00:10:08,724
Bye!

150
00:10:08,724 --> 00:10:11,206
Is it Grey, is it?

151
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:16,655
Great, well, I'm glad that
I could help you out today?

152
00:10:16,724 --> 00:10:18,758
Is there anything else
that I can do for you?

153
00:10:20,758 --> 00:10:22,310
Awesome.

154
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:24,413
Again, my name is Greyson.

155
00:10:24,448 --> 00:10:25,310
If you have any further issues,

156
00:10:25,344 --> 00:10:27,413
please don't hesitate
to call back.

157
00:10:27,413 --> 00:10:29,793
Thank you for calling--

158
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:31,896
Hello, sir?

159
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:34,275
Sir?

160
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:12,137
- LIAM: Hey, cuz.
- Hey.

161
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,413
LIAM:
Want a beer?

162
00:11:13,448 --> 00:11:15,310
Yes, please.

163
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,931
Awesome.

164
00:11:22,965 --> 00:11:25,206
Oh, thank you.

165
00:11:25,275 --> 00:11:27,000
Don't mention it.

166
00:11:28,137 --> 00:11:29,931
Oh.

167
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:32,689
You have to work late tonight?

168
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,965
Nah.

169
00:11:35,965 --> 00:11:38,137
Actually,
took off a little early.

170
00:11:38,172 --> 00:11:39,862
Went shootin' with a friend
of mine.

171
00:11:39,931 --> 00:11:41,965
A dude named "Winslow".

172
00:11:41,965 --> 00:11:43,827
"Weird Winslow",
they call him at work.

173
00:11:43,862 --> 00:11:44,965
Hmm.

174
00:11:44,965 --> 00:11:46,275
He picked up
his badass machine gun,

175
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,965
did some simple conversions
to it.

176
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,931
The thing goes full auto now.

177
00:11:50,965 --> 00:11:52,034
It was crazy.

178
00:11:52,068 --> 00:11:54,310
A guy they call "Weird Winslow"
has a machine gun?

179
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:57,034
LIAM:
Yeah.

180
00:11:57,103 --> 00:11:58,758
Weird Winslow
has a machine gun.

181
00:11:58,793 --> 00:12:00,275
Say it with me.

182
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,862
LIAM:
Yeah, he's alright.

183
00:12:01,862 --> 00:12:03,103
He's just a little--

184
00:12:03,172 --> 00:12:05,206
Anachronistic.

185
00:12:05,206 --> 00:12:10,379
Um-- yeah, I don't know
what that means, but--

186
00:12:12,206 --> 00:12:13,448
Weird Winslow
has a machine gun.

187
00:12:13,517 --> 00:12:14,896
-

188
00:12:14,896 --> 00:12:16,551
Anyways, we're goin' again
Sunday afternoon,

189
00:12:16,586 --> 00:12:19,862
before I head to Janice,
if you wanna go?

190
00:12:19,896 --> 00:12:23,103
No, I can't, I have James.

191
00:12:23,172 --> 00:12:24,931
- You sure?
- Mmhmm.

192
00:12:33,034 --> 00:12:35,344
LIAM:
Hey, you already eat?

193
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,862
Yeah.

194
00:12:37,896 --> 00:12:39,862
LIAM:
No James, tonight?

195
00:12:39,896 --> 00:12:43,413
No, not till Wednesday,
but then just for a little bit.

196
00:12:43,448 --> 00:12:46,068
- LIAM: Like usual.
- Yeah?

197
00:12:46,103 --> 00:12:48,034
LIAM:
Sorry, man.

198
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:49,172
Me, too.

199
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,310
Listen, hey, dude um--

200
00:13:15,344 --> 00:13:17,000
You know, I just wanna say...

201
00:13:20,448 --> 00:13:25,241
...thanks for letting me
and James stay here.

202
00:13:25,275 --> 00:13:26,137
As soon as I get back
on my feet, I--

203
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:28,275
Nay.

204
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,965
You're family, man.

205
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Blood's thicker than water.

206
00:13:32,068 --> 00:13:34,103
You stay here as long
as you need to.

207
00:13:34,137 --> 00:13:36,793
Okay?

208
00:14:13,551 --> 00:14:16,000
James, time to get up.

209
00:14:25,551 --> 00:14:27,275
Buddy, come on, time to get up.

210
00:15:06,068 --> 00:15:08,620
- Good morning.
- Morning.

211
00:15:08,655 --> 00:15:12,379
Um, thank you for the latté
yesterday.

212
00:15:12,413 --> 00:15:15,413
I wanted to come by and say so,
but Eric's--

213
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:16,275
anyway, I can give you
some money

214
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:18,724
as soon as we get paid
on Thursday.

215
00:15:18,724 --> 00:15:19,655
Grey, if you wanna pay me back

216
00:15:19,724 --> 00:15:24,241
you can always buy me coffee
after work.

217
00:15:24,275 --> 00:15:27,965
or dinner or both.

218
00:15:30,448 --> 00:15:32,310
Are you asking me out?

219
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:33,482
I mean, come on.

220
00:15:33,586 --> 00:15:37,758
I've been tryin' to get you
to ask me out for months.

221
00:15:37,793 --> 00:15:41,034
But you haven't quite picked up
on it.

222
00:15:41,068 --> 00:15:41,965
So, yeah--

223
00:15:42,689 --> 00:15:45,241
I'm asking.

224
00:15:45,275 --> 00:15:49,241
A girl's gotta take care
of herself sometime, right?

225
00:15:49,275 --> 00:15:52,103
I have my son on the weekends.

226
00:15:52,137 --> 00:15:53,586
So Thursday then?

227
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:57,689
6:30 p.m., Anthem Coffee.

228
00:15:57,724 --> 00:15:59,379
Coffee date?

229
00:15:59,413 --> 00:16:01,103
Okay.

230
00:16:04,482 --> 00:16:06,689
This isn't a prank, is it?

231
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:08,517
No, no prank.

232
00:16:10,758 --> 00:16:12,758
I like you, Grey.

233
00:16:12,793 --> 00:16:15,655
Why?

234
00:16:15,689 --> 00:16:17,724
It's 'cause you're different.

235
00:16:17,793 --> 00:16:23,448
And I need different in my life
right now, I think.

236
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,275
Um--

237
00:16:30,413 --> 00:16:31,482
- Oh--
- Oh.

238
00:16:31,551 --> 00:16:33,137
- You should go clock in.
- Yeah, I should clock in.

239
00:16:33,137 --> 00:16:34,310
Yeah, um.

240
00:16:39,758 --> 00:16:41,137
- Grey.
- GREYSON: Yeah?

241
00:16:41,172 --> 00:16:42,620
Can you come in here a sec?

242
00:16:42,655 --> 00:16:44,275
Is everything alright?

243
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,413
ERIC:
Yeah, just come on.

244
00:16:51,586 --> 00:16:53,068
Have a seat, Grey.

245
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,344
Jen, from upstairs,
says I gotta write you up

246
00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:02,241
for being late the other day.

247
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,758
Eric, it was just
a few minutes, I was--

248
00:17:03,827 --> 00:17:08,344
Look, I like you, Grey,
I do, okay?

249
00:17:08,379 --> 00:17:10,379
But the company policy
is clear.

250
00:17:10,413 --> 00:17:12,793
You have to be at your desk,
you have to be logged in,

251
00:17:12,862 --> 00:17:15,517
and be ready to take calls
by 7:00 a.m.

252
00:17:15,517 --> 00:17:16,551
I know.

253
00:17:16,655 --> 00:17:17,827
Look, I gave you a verbal
warning last time, okay?

254
00:17:17,862 --> 00:17:20,379
So I have to write you up
this time.

255
00:17:20,379 --> 00:17:21,827
It's not a big deal.

256
00:17:21,862 --> 00:17:24,413
It just states that
we spoke about it

257
00:17:24,448 --> 00:17:27,551
and that if it continues,
further action,

258
00:17:27,586 --> 00:17:30,206
up to and including termination,
could occur.

259
00:17:30,206 --> 00:17:32,241
Now, nobody wants that, Grey.

260
00:17:32,275 --> 00:17:34,482
Just sign there.

261
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:37,206
It states that you understand
the company policies

262
00:17:37,241 --> 00:17:39,758
as laid out
in the employee handbook.

263
00:17:39,827 --> 00:17:41,620
I didn't get
an employee handbook.

264
00:17:41,689 --> 00:17:43,172
Well, you're tryin'
to be difficult?

265
00:17:43,206 --> 00:17:44,344
No.

266
00:17:44,379 --> 00:17:45,862
Sign then.

267
00:17:45,862 --> 00:17:46,724
Here.

268
00:17:46,758 --> 00:17:48,551
Alright.

269
00:17:48,586 --> 00:17:50,379
ERIC:
Alright, thanks.

270
00:17:50,379 --> 00:17:51,241
Yeah, I got it.

271
00:17:51,275 --> 00:17:52,517
That's it.

272
00:17:52,551 --> 00:17:54,517
- That's it?
- Yep.

273
00:17:56,758 --> 00:17:58,344
So it won't happen again, okay?

274
00:18:01,275 --> 00:18:04,620
Look, the next time,
there's a three-day suspension,

275
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,758
and time after that is well--
you know?

276
00:18:08,793 --> 00:18:10,448
I understand.

277
00:18:10,482 --> 00:18:12,344
Good.

278
00:18:12,413 --> 00:18:13,551
You can go now.

279
00:18:14,758 --> 00:18:16,517
Hey, Grey.

280
00:18:16,586 --> 00:18:19,655
Why don't you smile more, huh?

281
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:20,896
Yeah, there you go.

282
00:18:20,931 --> 00:18:21,827
Yeah.

283
00:18:25,482 --> 00:18:26,448
BARNES:
Once again, my name is Barnes.

284
00:18:26,448 --> 00:18:27,517
Thank you for callin' Tech Fix

285
00:18:27,586 --> 00:18:30,344
and I hope
you have a wonderful day.

286
00:18:30,413 --> 00:18:32,896
Grey, pick up the phone!

287
00:18:38,896 --> 00:18:40,413
Thank you for calling Tech Fix.

288
00:18:40,448 --> 00:18:41,931
This is Barnes,
how may I assist you today?

289
00:18:41,931 --> 00:18:42,931
Thank you for calling Tech Fix.

290
00:18:42,931 --> 00:18:44,655
This is Greyson.

291
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:45,931
How can I help you today?

292
00:19:48,724 --> 00:19:50,896
:
The forecast, showers
and thunderstorms today

293
00:19:50,931 --> 00:19:54,586
with strong southwesterly winds
to 37 miles per hour.

294
00:19:54,655 --> 00:19:57,517
We'll have a high of 59 degrees
with the temperature dropping

295
00:19:57,517 --> 00:19:59,517
rapidly towards this evening.

296
00:19:59,551 --> 00:20:01,655
The showers and thunderstorm's
expected to continue

297
00:20:01,689 --> 00:20:03,000
until tomorrow morning.

298
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,344
The overnight low, near 38.

299
00:20:05,379 --> 00:20:06,206
Rain tapering off to--

300
00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:17,310
Button Grey slowpoke over there.

301
00:20:17,344 --> 00:20:18,482
Oh yeah.

302
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:19,655
Fuck Grey.

303
00:20:19,689 --> 00:20:21,310
BARNES:

304
00:20:25,034 --> 00:20:27,000
Yes, ma'am, I understand.

305
00:20:27,034 --> 00:20:28,379
What I'm tryin' to tell you--

306
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:31,448
Yes.

307
00:20:31,482 --> 00:20:33,000
Okay, ma'am--

308
00:20:34,827 --> 00:20:36,896
Ma'am, please--

309
00:20:36,931 --> 00:20:39,482
Yes, what I'm-- what I'm trying
to tell you is that if-

310
00:20:39,482 --> 00:20:42,827
if you just-- hello?

311
00:20:42,862 --> 00:20:44,310
Hello?

312
00:20:58,827 --> 00:20:59,896
Hey.

313
00:20:59,965 --> 00:21:01,551
Hey.

314
00:21:01,586 --> 00:21:05,413
So we're still on
for tomorrow night, right?

315
00:21:05,413 --> 00:21:09,758
Yeah, if you still want to.

316
00:21:09,793 --> 00:21:12,931
Yeah, I-- I still want to.

317
00:21:12,965 --> 00:21:14,862
- Okay.
- Okay.

318
00:21:17,724 --> 00:21:19,413
I should go.

319
00:21:19,448 --> 00:21:20,931
I gotta go pick up James
by like 4:30, so--

320
00:21:20,965 --> 00:21:21,896
Yeah, no worries.

321
00:21:21,896 --> 00:21:25,586
I will see you tomorrow.

322
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,551
- Okay.
- Okay.

323
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:28,793
- Bye.
- Bye.

324
00:21:40,517 --> 00:21:42,793
Really?

325
00:21:42,862 --> 00:21:43,931
What?

326
00:21:43,965 --> 00:21:46,034
Grey.

327
00:21:46,068 --> 00:21:48,034
Yeah, Grey!

328
00:21:48,068 --> 00:21:49,793
I like him.

329
00:21:49,827 --> 00:21:52,379
Isn't he like-- what,
20 years older than you?

330
00:21:52,413 --> 00:21:53,551
No.

331
00:21:56,379 --> 00:21:57,275
So what?

332
00:21:57,344 --> 00:21:58,758
My dad's like 10 years older
than my mom

333
00:21:58,793 --> 00:22:01,551
and they're happy, so--

334
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,448
Oh, doesn't he have a kid?

335
00:22:04,482 --> 00:22:07,620
Yeah, so?

336
00:22:07,655 --> 00:22:10,137
All I'm saying is be careful.

337
00:22:10,172 --> 00:22:11,965
Divorced, single dad,
works here--

338
00:22:11,965 --> 00:22:12,758
Oh.

339
00:22:12,793 --> 00:22:14,551
He's probably damaged goods,
Zoe.

340
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,655
Okay, why do we say those things
about single dads,

341
00:22:16,689 --> 00:22:18,689
'cause like
we call single moms "brave"?

342
00:22:18,724 --> 00:22:21,965
"Ooh, look at her raisin'
that baby all on her own."

343
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,137
But when it comes to single dads
we're like,

344
00:22:23,137 --> 00:22:24,931
"Oh, look at him,
he is a loser"

345
00:22:24,965 --> 00:22:26,172
and that's bullshit, Kate--

346
00:22:26,172 --> 00:22:27,586
- Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Because we don't know--

347
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,965
Whoa!
Point made.

348
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,379
Jeez.

349
00:22:31,448 --> 00:22:33,137
- All I'm saying is be careful.
- Oh.

350
00:22:33,172 --> 00:22:36,931
There's something a little off
about him.

351
00:22:36,965 --> 00:22:38,965
He's weird.

352
00:22:38,965 --> 00:22:41,103
- He's shy.
- Weird.

353
00:22:41,137 --> 00:22:42,413
Shy!

354
00:22:42,448 --> 00:22:44,413
Same thing.

355
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:45,793
So I'm shy.

356
00:22:45,827 --> 00:22:47,758
Does that make me weird?

357
00:22:47,793 --> 00:22:49,793
Um, yeah.

358
00:22:50,758 --> 00:22:52,758
But I love you anyway.

359
00:22:52,793 --> 00:22:54,517
Come on happy hour calls.

360
00:22:54,586 --> 00:22:55,482
Oh my God!

361
00:23:04,586 --> 00:23:05,689
Daddy!

362
00:23:12,034 --> 00:23:12,896
Hey, bud.

363
00:23:15,206 --> 00:23:16,206
How was daycare today?

364
00:23:16,241 --> 00:23:17,862
You know, what we did today?

365
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,517
What'd you do today?

366
00:23:19,551 --> 00:23:21,689
We painted pictures
with our fingers.

367
00:23:21,724 --> 00:23:23,758
Really?

368
00:23:23,827 --> 00:23:24,827
Can I see?

369
00:23:28,758 --> 00:23:29,862
Hey.

370
00:23:29,862 --> 00:23:31,931
Had them finger-paint outside.

371
00:23:36,862 --> 00:23:38,206
GREYSON:
Wow!

372
00:23:38,241 --> 00:23:41,103
This is very good.

373
00:23:41,172 --> 00:23:43,206
You did this all by yourself?

374
00:23:43,206 --> 00:23:44,965
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

375
00:23:45,034 --> 00:23:47,206
This is very pretty, son,
you did a good job.

376
00:23:47,241 --> 00:23:48,689
Is this for me?

377
00:23:48,724 --> 00:23:52,206
No, for mommy.

378
00:23:52,206 --> 00:23:54,551
I'm sure she'll love it.

379
00:23:54,586 --> 00:23:56,896
JAMES:
I made you, too.

380
00:23:56,931 --> 00:23:59,000
I put "to dad" on it,

381
00:23:59,034 --> 00:24:01,448
so you would know
which one's yours.

382
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,827
That's great.

383
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:09,758
I think we should go home
and hang it right up.

384
00:24:09,758 --> 00:24:12,586
Come on.

385
00:24:12,586 --> 00:24:14,931
Uh, this is his stuff.

386
00:24:14,931 --> 00:24:16,586
Oh yeah.

387
00:24:16,586 --> 00:24:18,000
Hold your bag.

388
00:24:18,068 --> 00:24:19,758
And Marilyn wanted me
to remind you

389
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:22,103
it's your week to pay.

390
00:24:22,137 --> 00:24:25,620
I get paid on Thursday, though,
so I don't--

391
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,862
I don't have it at the moment,

392
00:24:27,931 --> 00:24:29,793
but I can give it to you
right after they send it.

393
00:24:29,827 --> 00:24:31,068
That's fine.

394
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:32,103
Thank you.

395
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:32,655
Alright, let's go.

396
00:24:32,724 --> 00:24:34,000
See you tomorrow, James.

397
00:24:34,068 --> 00:24:35,241
- JAMES: Bye.
- Bye.

398
00:24:35,275 --> 00:24:37,137
- Thank you.
- Sure.

399
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,172
One kid scoop
of birthday cake ice, please.

400
00:24:45,241 --> 00:24:46,896
Okay, is that a cup or a cone?

401
00:24:46,931 --> 00:24:47,896
How much more is the cone?

402
00:24:47,931 --> 00:24:50,586
It's 30c.

403
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,827
- Okay.
- Okay.

404
00:24:58,241 --> 00:24:59,586
Here you go.

405
00:25:01,827 --> 00:25:05,000
Okay, it's a buck, 45.

406
00:25:05,034 --> 00:25:06,620
Thank you.

407
00:25:08,655 --> 00:25:09,793
There you go.

408
00:25:11,241 --> 00:25:13,172
Uh, you said it was a buck, 45.

409
00:25:13,172 --> 00:25:15,137
SHOPKEEPER:
Yeah, sorry,
I only have pennies.

410
00:25:15,172 --> 00:25:16,758
- That's fine.
- Okay.

411
00:25:16,827 --> 00:25:19,758
JAMES:
We're savin' up our change
to go to Disneyland.

412
00:25:19,827 --> 00:25:22,724
We put it in a jar at home,
and when it's full,

413
00:25:22,793 --> 00:25:24,034
we're goin' to Disneyland.

414
00:25:24,068 --> 00:25:26,758
Oh, I don't think 5 pennies
is gonna get you very far, kid.

415
00:25:26,827 --> 00:25:29,068
JAMES:
Daddy says, "When you workin'
towards somethin'

416
00:25:29,137 --> 00:25:30,172
every penny matters".

417
00:25:30,206 --> 00:25:31,551
That's right, son.

418
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,137
Yeah, every penny matters.

419
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,275
There you go.

420
00:25:44,379 --> 00:25:45,482
You want a bite, daddy?

421
00:25:45,517 --> 00:25:47,655
No, that's all you, dude,
but you have to promise me

422
00:25:47,689 --> 00:25:49,344
you're gonna eat some dinner
tonight, okay?

423
00:25:49,344 --> 00:25:50,655
Okay, what's for dinner?

424
00:25:56,344 --> 00:25:58,206
Dad, can you help me?

425
00:25:58,241 --> 00:25:59,724
Sure thing, buddy,
just a minute.

426
00:26:20,758 --> 00:26:22,137
Oh, you're gonna give him
purple stripes?

427
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:23,793
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's cool.

428
00:26:23,862 --> 00:26:24,896
That's a good idea.

429
00:26:28,896 --> 00:26:31,689
- What do you think?
- Yeah.

430
00:26:31,724 --> 00:26:32,689
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

431
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:33,413
What else does it need?

432
00:26:33,448 --> 00:26:37,137
- Anything?
- Mmm.

433
00:26:37,206 --> 00:26:39,103
- I think it's pretty good.
- Yeah.

434
00:26:39,137 --> 00:26:41,034
Yeah, that looks like birthday
cake ice cream, right?

435
00:26:41,068 --> 00:26:43,103
- Definitely.
- Definitely.

436
00:26:44,448 --> 00:26:46,310
I'll just shade it
in a little bit more.

437
00:27:01,379 --> 00:27:02,965
MARILYN:
I thought I heard you.

438
00:27:02,965 --> 00:27:06,310
Oh my gosh, that's amazing!

439
00:27:06,344 --> 00:27:07,793
I did it myself.

440
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:09,344
Is that me
with the blonde hair?

441
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:11,137
- Yeah.
- Oh, I love it.

442
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:13,448
Thank you so much, sweetie.

443
00:27:13,482 --> 00:27:15,793
- You're late.
- I know.

444
00:27:15,793 --> 00:27:18,172
We were workin' on our book.

445
00:27:18,206 --> 00:27:21,275
So is your mother just gonna
let you have her car?

446
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,689
Yeah, she said I could keep it.

447
00:27:24,034 --> 00:27:24,931
Good for you, Grey.

448
00:27:24,965 --> 00:27:27,344
What am I supposed to do,
tell her "no"?

449
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:31,793
Hmm, somebody always comes
to your rescue, don't they?

450
00:27:31,827 --> 00:27:34,034
Hey, go on inside, mister,
dinner's about ready.

451
00:27:34,103 --> 00:27:35,965
- JAMES: We ate.
- Oh.

452
00:27:35,965 --> 00:27:37,448
What'd you eat?

453
00:27:37,482 --> 00:27:39,275
Daddy's scrambled eggs.

454
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,482
Okay.

455
00:27:40,517 --> 00:27:41,448
You need some real food.

456
00:27:41,482 --> 00:27:43,103
Go on in.

457
00:27:43,137 --> 00:27:44,931
Here, take this painting.

458
00:27:44,965 --> 00:27:46,862
Thank you.

459
00:27:48,137 --> 00:27:50,379
He needs more than eggs
for dinner.

460
00:27:50,448 --> 00:27:51,586
GREYSON:
I know.

461
00:27:51,655 --> 00:27:53,448
I'm gonna go buy some fruit
and stuff for this weekend

462
00:27:53,482 --> 00:27:55,034
after I get paid.

463
00:27:55,103 --> 00:27:55,965
Yeah, about that--

464
00:27:58,379 --> 00:28:00,482
What's up, mister?

465
00:28:00,517 --> 00:28:02,103
I forgot to say "bye" to dad.

466
00:28:02,172 --> 00:28:04,827
- Can I?
- Of course.

467
00:28:08,034 --> 00:28:09,862
I'll see you this weekend, okay?

468
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:11,172
Alright, go back inside.

469
00:28:16,586 --> 00:28:19,275
So what were you gonna say?

470
00:28:19,344 --> 00:28:20,241
Nothing.

471
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:22,379
Just have a good weekend
with him, okay?

472
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,034
GREYSON:
Shit.

473
00:28:54,896 --> 00:28:56,310
Hey, Grey.

474
00:28:56,344 --> 00:28:57,482
Hey.

475
00:28:57,517 --> 00:28:59,068
No gym today?

476
00:28:59,103 --> 00:29:00,931
Uh...

477
00:29:00,965 --> 00:29:03,103
No, my free trial expired.

478
00:29:03,137 --> 00:29:04,586
- Lame.
- Yeah.

479
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,931
Oh, hey, this is Winslow.

480
00:29:06,931 --> 00:29:09,275
Winslow Danny,
meet Greyson Bell.

481
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,448
It's nice to meet you Mr. Bell.

482
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:11,137
Hi.

483
00:29:11,172 --> 00:29:13,241
What's with the machine gun?

484
00:29:14,931 --> 00:29:15,931
Well, this is what
those cream puffs

485
00:29:15,965 --> 00:29:19,275
would call an "assault rifle".

486
00:29:19,275 --> 00:29:20,413
Winslow was just showin' me
the conversion work

487
00:29:20,413 --> 00:29:21,896
he did on it.

488
00:29:21,931 --> 00:29:23,448
- Did all the work himself.
- Hmm.

489
00:29:23,482 --> 00:29:26,896
I'm thinkin' about buying it
from him.

490
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:29,000
WINSLOW:
You shoot, Mr. Bell?

491
00:29:29,068 --> 00:29:32,103
By shootin' I mean you ever
fire a weapon.

492
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:34,275
Not in anger, though.

493
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:38,448
No one should ever fire
a weapon in anger.

494
00:29:38,482 --> 00:29:40,310
You can just call me "Grey",
but-- no,

495
00:29:40,344 --> 00:29:44,931
I mean I don't even know
which end to-

496
00:29:44,931 --> 00:29:46,103
I know which end, I'm j-

497
00:29:46,137 --> 00:29:47,620
I'm just sayin' like no,
I wouldn't.

498
00:29:47,655 --> 00:29:50,448
Well, then, sir,
would you like to learn,

499
00:29:50,448 --> 00:29:55,068
because I am in fact
a certified safety instructor

500
00:29:55,103 --> 00:29:58,172
and licensed dealer
for that matter.

501
00:29:58,241 --> 00:30:01,517
Liam and I, we're goin' out
shooting Sunday after work.

502
00:30:01,586 --> 00:30:03,413
You know, it'd be a pleasure
to have you come join us

503
00:30:03,448 --> 00:30:06,137
in celebratin'
our Second Amendment rights,

504
00:30:06,172 --> 00:30:09,586
in true red-blooded
American fashion I might add.

505
00:30:09,586 --> 00:30:10,793
Yeah, absolutely.

506
00:30:10,793 --> 00:30:13,241
You guys are gonna celebrate
by shooting a machine gun?

507
00:30:13,275 --> 00:30:14,586
Yeah.

508
00:30:14,586 --> 00:30:16,517
I own several of 'em.

509
00:30:16,586 --> 00:30:21,103
It's our God-given right.

510
00:30:21,137 --> 00:30:23,965
I have a kid, so I can't--
I can't do it you know.

511
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,620
Well, there you go.

512
00:30:25,655 --> 00:30:28,344
That's an even better reason
to learn.

513
00:30:28,413 --> 00:30:31,620
Gun safety is important
if you have children.

514
00:30:31,655 --> 00:30:34,413
Picture the scenario,
your kid finds a gun.

515
00:30:34,448 --> 00:30:37,103
Thinks it's a toy.

516
00:30:37,103 --> 00:30:38,172
Can you imagine
the consequences

517
00:30:38,241 --> 00:30:41,275
of somethin' like that
happenin'?

518
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:44,448
Downright unthinkable.

519
00:30:44,448 --> 00:30:46,172
Here, check this out.

520
00:30:46,206 --> 00:30:49,448
- Whoa, oh, no, no, I can't.
- It's alright, safety's on.

521
00:30:49,482 --> 00:30:50,620
Just don't put your finger
on the trigger,

522
00:30:50,655 --> 00:30:52,931
- it's uh, right there.
- Okay.

523
00:30:52,931 --> 00:30:55,275
It's alright,
ain't gonna bite you.

524
00:30:55,275 --> 00:30:56,310
Alright.

525
00:30:58,241 --> 00:30:59,275
Whoa, Jesus Christ!

526
00:30:59,344 --> 00:31:00,000
Oh, s-- I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to.

527
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:02,689
- Dude, I'm sorry.
- Listen.

528
00:31:02,724 --> 00:31:06,068
You never ever point a gun
at somethin'

529
00:31:06,137 --> 00:31:07,689
you don't intend to kill.

530
00:31:07,724 --> 00:31:11,482
You understand what I'm sayin',
Mr. Bell?

531
00:31:11,517 --> 00:31:12,551
GREYSON:
I'm sorry.

532
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,965
Well, I'm just sayin'
if you remember anything,

533
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,482
remember that.

534
00:31:15,482 --> 00:31:17,379
Gun's not a toy.

535
00:31:17,413 --> 00:31:19,379
It should be treated
with respect.

536
00:31:19,448 --> 00:31:20,379
I got it.

537
00:31:20,448 --> 00:31:21,655
Jesus.

538
00:31:21,689 --> 00:31:25,413
Well, I believe you, but here.

539
00:31:25,482 --> 00:31:26,896
- The safety's right here--
- No.

540
00:31:26,965 --> 00:31:29,034
And you just make sure
that sucker's on first.

541
00:31:29,068 --> 00:31:30,241
No, I shouldn't.

542
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,344
That's alright.

543
00:31:31,344 --> 00:31:33,379
Here, take it.

544
00:31:35,034 --> 00:31:37,000
No, we don't--
you just hold it right there.

545
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Yeah.

546
00:31:38,034 --> 00:31:39,413
Alright.

547
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:42,172
Now, listen,
when you pull the trigger,

548
00:31:42,172 --> 00:31:44,310
this thing is gonna kick back
at you.

549
00:31:44,344 --> 00:31:46,551
That's gonna cause the barrel
to climb,

550
00:31:46,586 --> 00:31:48,482
so you have to kinda just--

551
00:31:48,482 --> 00:31:51,000
Here, there you go.

552
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:54,517
Just like that.

553
00:31:54,551 --> 00:31:56,241
Feels good, doesn't it?

554
00:31:56,310 --> 00:32:00,034
Ugh, no, I-- here.

555
00:32:00,068 --> 00:32:01,517
I'm never gonna shoot
anything like that.

556
00:32:01,551 --> 00:32:02,758
Yeah, I understand.

557
00:32:02,793 --> 00:32:05,586
A gun that size
can be intimidating.

558
00:32:05,586 --> 00:32:06,620
Kinda like the young
college girl

559
00:32:06,655 --> 00:32:08,137
havin' her first sex encounter.

560
00:32:09,551 --> 00:32:10,551
She's really kinda hopin'
she gets somethin'

561
00:32:10,551 --> 00:32:11,551
she can handle.

562
00:32:13,241 --> 00:32:14,724
If you catch my drift.

563
00:32:14,758 --> 00:32:15,724
Yeah.

564
00:32:18,413 --> 00:32:19,551
WINSLOW:
I won't hold it against you.

565
00:32:20,344 --> 00:32:22,068
LIAM:
Hey, you want a beer?

566
00:32:22,068 --> 00:32:24,068
Yeah.

567
00:32:24,103 --> 00:32:28,310
Hey, somethin' American
and/or domestic, please.

568
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:30,620
LIAM:
Yeah.

569
00:32:30,655 --> 00:32:33,620
How about we start
with somethin' small.

570
00:32:33,689 --> 00:32:35,551
That's small?

571
00:32:35,551 --> 00:32:37,517
Comparatively, yes, sir.

572
00:32:37,551 --> 00:32:40,310
It's a revolver, simple.

573
00:32:40,379 --> 00:32:43,103
Just point and pull the trigger.

574
00:32:43,137 --> 00:32:45,724
Kinda like a dart gun.

575
00:32:45,758 --> 00:32:47,724
You know, those little kid toys
with a plastic dart

576
00:32:47,724 --> 00:32:49,413
and a suction cup on the end?

577
00:32:49,413 --> 00:32:50,586
Kind I used to shoot
my little brother

578
00:32:50,586 --> 00:32:52,379
in the forehead
with all the time.

579
00:32:55,103 --> 00:32:56,241
Did you ever have
one of those dart guns

580
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:59,034
when you're a kid, Mr. Bell?

581
00:32:59,068 --> 00:33:00,137
GREYSON:
Yeah, sure.

582
00:33:00,206 --> 00:33:02,103
Everybody did.

583
00:33:02,137 --> 00:33:04,655
I do believe you are correct,
sir.

584
00:33:04,689 --> 00:33:07,655
I reckon about every boy did.

585
00:33:07,655 --> 00:33:10,103
Well, this ain't that
much different than those,

586
00:33:10,137 --> 00:33:11,655
really.

587
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:14,620
Although,
this shoots real bullets

588
00:33:14,655 --> 00:33:17,689
instead of a plastic little dart
with a suction cup on the end,

589
00:33:17,724 --> 00:33:21,586
which is considerably
less dangerous.

590
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,448
And this is quite
a bit heavier, too.

591
00:33:30,275 --> 00:33:32,103
Is this thing loaded?

592
00:33:32,137 --> 00:33:36,034
That is not, but this one is.

593
00:33:36,103 --> 00:33:37,724
A man must be prepared
to defend himself

594
00:33:37,793 --> 00:33:41,517
against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

595
00:33:41,551 --> 00:33:44,482
You just point
and pull the trigger,

596
00:33:44,482 --> 00:33:48,448
and you got a dead body
on the other end.

597
00:33:48,482 --> 00:33:51,137
Simple and neat, as you please.

598
00:33:51,137 --> 00:33:52,620
I don't wanna shoot anybody.

599
00:33:54,448 --> 00:33:57,310
Pacifist.

600
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,517
I get that.

601
00:33:59,551 --> 00:34:03,241
Path of least resistance
is a tough one to walk sometimes

602
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:07,206
and deserves its own respect
for the difficulties therein.

603
00:34:07,241 --> 00:34:11,413
Not everyone's a warrior,
Mr. Bell.

604
00:34:11,448 --> 00:34:13,379
I accept you for who you are.

605
00:34:13,413 --> 00:34:15,551
Why don't you come with us
this weekend, Grey?

606
00:34:15,551 --> 00:34:17,862
We'll be shootin' cans
and stuff, it's fun.

607
00:34:17,862 --> 00:34:18,862
GREYSON:
Shooting cans?

608
00:34:18,862 --> 00:34:20,551
Yeah.

609
00:34:20,586 --> 00:34:22,827
Yes, sir, Mr. Bell.

610
00:34:22,862 --> 00:34:27,103
Mexicans, Africans,
Puerto Ricans.

611
00:34:29,172 --> 00:34:31,896
It's not even
a little bit funny.

612
00:34:31,931 --> 00:34:34,862
I'm sorry, I was just jokin',
Mr. Bell.

613
00:34:38,931 --> 00:34:40,758
Fact is we've got
a serious immigrant problem

614
00:34:40,793 --> 00:34:45,206
in this country anyways
and it should be dealt with.

615
00:34:45,206 --> 00:34:47,413
I'm not sayin'
I advocate shootin' anyone.

616
00:34:47,448 --> 00:34:50,448
Well, that would be just wrong.

617
00:34:50,517 --> 00:34:52,206
They oughta just pass
some legislation

618
00:34:52,206 --> 00:34:54,758
to keep 'em out
in the first place.

619
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:57,793
Build a friggin' wall
or somethin'.

620
00:34:57,862 --> 00:35:00,931
Dude, can I borrow
a couple bucks for gas

621
00:35:00,931 --> 00:35:02,275
to get to work tomorrow?

622
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:04,413
I can pay you back as soon
as I get home.

623
00:35:04,448 --> 00:35:06,448
I'm all tapped out till Friday,
man.

624
00:35:06,482 --> 00:35:09,517
- Sorry.
- Shit.

625
00:35:09,586 --> 00:35:12,827
I could arrange a small loan
for you.

626
00:35:12,896 --> 00:35:14,448
Or I could just give you
five bucks

627
00:35:14,482 --> 00:35:17,413
of my hard-earned money.

628
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,724
If takin' a handout would suit
your democratic mindset

629
00:35:19,758 --> 00:35:21,586
a little better.

630
00:35:24,758 --> 00:35:27,172
Hey, don't say shit like that
around here, okay?

631
00:35:27,241 --> 00:35:28,586
Grey's dealin'
with a lot of shit

632
00:35:28,586 --> 00:35:30,344
and he's family.

633
00:35:30,413 --> 00:35:31,586
Money's tight, that's all.

634
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,241
Shit, Liam, I was just joking.

635
00:35:33,275 --> 00:35:36,586
I know that, but he doesn't.

636
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:39,896
- Just give him a break.
- You're right, of course.

637
00:35:39,931 --> 00:35:42,758
So I go forth and apologize?

638
00:35:42,793 --> 00:35:44,275
No.

639
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:47,448
Just-- here.

640
00:35:47,448 --> 00:35:48,793
Let me see that 9.

641
00:35:48,827 --> 00:35:50,551
You really carry that thing
around loaded?

642
00:35:52,241 --> 00:35:53,551
I do indeed.

643
00:36:35,551 --> 00:36:36,620
Fuck!

644
00:37:41,517 --> 00:37:42,862
Pump 2.

645
00:37:42,896 --> 00:37:44,275
Really?

646
00:38:34,793 --> 00:38:36,655
Good morning.

647
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,482
Morning.

648
00:38:40,965 --> 00:38:41,482
I gotta--

649
00:38:41,551 --> 00:38:44,344
Yeah, go get to work.

650
00:38:53,137 --> 00:38:56,655
Yes, and if it does happen
again um, please call back,

651
00:38:56,655 --> 00:38:57,655
and you have
my direct extension,

652
00:38:57,689 --> 00:39:01,103
and we can take care of it.

653
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:01,689
Okay, great.

654
00:39:01,724 --> 00:39:04,034
Yes.

655
00:39:04,034 --> 00:39:04,931
Oh, again, my name is Greyson,

656
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,068
thank you so much
for calling Tech Fix,

657
00:39:07,103 --> 00:39:10,103
and have a great rest
of your night.

658
00:39:10,172 --> 00:39:11,551
Okay, you too.

659
00:39:26,689 --> 00:39:28,206
- Hey.
- Hey.

660
00:39:28,206 --> 00:39:29,206
Change your mind yet?

661
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:30,551
Nope.

662
00:39:30,586 --> 00:39:33,000
- You?
- Nope.

663
00:39:33,034 --> 00:39:35,758
So what's the plan?

664
00:39:35,827 --> 00:39:37,862
I just gotta go cash
my paycheck,

665
00:39:37,862 --> 00:39:38,862
and run a few errands,

666
00:39:38,896 --> 00:39:41,517
and then I'm gonna go home,
and get ready.

667
00:39:41,551 --> 00:39:44,586
Do you wanna go out to dinner
or somethin' after coffee?

668
00:39:44,655 --> 00:39:46,172
Yeah, I would like that.

669
00:39:46,206 --> 00:39:48,172
- Yes, um--
- Okay.

670
00:39:48,206 --> 00:39:50,172
Okay.

671
00:39:50,206 --> 00:39:51,862
- I should go.
- Uh, yeah.

672
00:39:51,862 --> 00:39:55,000
I will see you in an hour?

673
00:39:55,034 --> 00:39:57,413
- 6:30, yeah.
- 6:30.

674
00:39:59,827 --> 00:40:01,103
- Okay.
- Alright, see you.

675
00:40:01,172 --> 00:40:04,068
See you in an hour.

676
00:40:07,241 --> 00:40:08,517
GREYSON:
Fuck.

677
00:40:55,034 --> 00:40:56,000
Hey.

678
00:40:56,034 --> 00:40:58,724
Hey.

679
00:40:58,758 --> 00:40:59,758
You showed up.

680
00:40:59,827 --> 00:41:01,758
Yeah, I'm sorry I'm late.

681
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,793
I was starting to think that
you wouldn't.

682
00:41:05,827 --> 00:41:08,758
Oh, no, I just--

683
00:41:08,793 --> 00:41:09,620
I didn't know what to wear.

684
00:41:12,793 --> 00:41:14,448
Well, I mean you look great.

685
00:41:16,241 --> 00:41:17,620
Thanks.

686
00:41:17,655 --> 00:41:20,103
Just you know,
it's been a long time

687
00:41:20,137 --> 00:41:22,931
since I've been on a date
with the work, and the kid,

688
00:41:22,965 --> 00:41:26,068
and you know,
you look great, too.

689
00:41:27,793 --> 00:41:28,931
Buy me coffee, Grey.

690
00:41:28,931 --> 00:41:30,551
Alright.

691
00:41:32,586 --> 00:41:34,931
Alright, the big question.

692
00:41:34,965 --> 00:41:36,551
Uh-oh.

693
00:41:36,586 --> 00:41:38,068
It's just a question.

694
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,068
Alright, go ahead.

695
00:41:43,068 --> 00:41:45,068
What do you keep workin' on
in the break room?

696
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:46,586
What's in that sketchbook?

697
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,931
Oh, it's--

698
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:52,103
It's just somethin'
I'm workin' on with my son.

699
00:41:52,103 --> 00:41:54,586
- Aw!
- Hey, guys.

700
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:55,689
- How are you two, today?
- Good.

701
00:41:55,758 --> 00:41:57,068
- Oh, good, thank you.
- Good.

702
00:41:57,103 --> 00:41:58,931
Can I get you guys started
with anything to drink?

703
00:41:58,965 --> 00:42:01,172
Um, may I please have
a 12 ounce vanilla latté?

704
00:42:01,172 --> 00:42:02,724
Sounds good.

705
00:42:02,758 --> 00:42:05,827
- For you?
- Um, can I get a tea anything?

706
00:42:05,827 --> 00:42:07,275
Like a London Fog?

707
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:08,551
Okay.

708
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:09,551
- Alright.
- Thank you.

709
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,310
You'll like it.

710
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:11,310
Okay.

711
00:42:11,344 --> 00:42:12,137
I don't know what that is.

712
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:18,655
Okay, so?

713
00:42:18,655 --> 00:42:20,241
So--

714
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:21,655
It's a book.

715
00:42:21,689 --> 00:42:23,172
What kind of book?

716
00:42:23,172 --> 00:42:25,724
It's nothing.

717
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,758
What?

718
00:42:27,827 --> 00:42:35,310
It's just I never really shared
with anyone and...

719
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:37,689
...no one's ever asked me
about it before actually.

720
00:42:37,724 --> 00:42:39,206
Well, I mean I'm asking.

721
00:42:42,137 --> 00:42:43,827
Okay.

722
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:45,896
Okay.

723
00:42:45,931 --> 00:42:48,655
It'll probably be easier
if I just showed you though.

724
00:42:48,689 --> 00:42:50,517
Yeah, okay.

725
00:42:53,793 --> 00:42:55,172
What?

726
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:55,793
Where are you--

727
00:42:55,827 --> 00:42:58,655
Just-- I'll be one second.

728
00:42:58,689 --> 00:43:00,172
Alright, here are your drinks.

729
00:43:00,172 --> 00:43:01,758
Oh, thank you.

730
00:43:03,862 --> 00:43:05,000
Thanks.

731
00:43:47,793 --> 00:43:49,034
So?

732
00:43:50,241 --> 00:43:52,206
This is really personal.

733
00:43:54,862 --> 00:43:56,206
Okay.

734
00:43:57,413 --> 00:43:59,103
Yeah, it's just me and my son,

735
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:02,310
we really put a lot of work
into this, and normally,

736
00:44:02,344 --> 00:44:04,758
I would never share this
with anyone.

737
00:44:04,793 --> 00:44:06,827
Grey, you said that already.

738
00:44:06,862 --> 00:44:09,482
I'm not gonna tell anyone,
I promise.

739
00:44:09,482 --> 00:44:11,965
These are all originals
and they can't be replaced,

740
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
so I'm trusting you.

741
00:44:16,034 --> 00:44:17,793
ZOEY:
Grey.

742
00:44:17,827 --> 00:44:19,310
Okay, okay.

743
00:44:43,206 --> 00:44:46,206
These are really good, Grey.

744
00:44:46,275 --> 00:44:47,448
Really.

745
00:44:57,103 --> 00:44:59,724
Have you always been an artist?

746
00:44:59,793 --> 00:45:03,241
It's the only thing
I ever wanted to be.

747
00:45:03,275 --> 00:45:05,413
I've been drawing
ever since I was a kid.

748
00:45:05,482 --> 00:45:07,275
Hmm.

749
00:45:07,344 --> 00:45:10,448
Even went to a pretty good
art school, got a degree,

750
00:45:10,517 --> 00:45:14,758
started my own business,
you know, but--

751
00:45:18,551 --> 00:45:20,241
But?

752
00:45:20,275 --> 00:45:24,862
But then James came along.

753
00:45:24,862 --> 00:45:26,068
We just--

754
00:45:26,103 --> 00:45:31,793
We were not ready at all,
we-- we were totally not ready.

755
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:35,827
And you know,
I had to look for a real job,

756
00:45:35,862 --> 00:45:37,862
somethin' with insurance.

757
00:45:41,034 --> 00:45:43,551
Had to sell our supplies,
and all my paintings,

758
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:47,206
and stuff to buy diapers.

759
00:45:47,206 --> 00:45:48,896
Turns out that
an art school degree

760
00:45:48,896 --> 00:45:53,206
doesn't really translate
to the real world.

761
00:45:53,241 --> 00:45:56,344
Before we knew it,
went underwater

762
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:59,241
and lost everything.

763
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:06,000
And now you work at Tech Fix?

764
00:46:06,068 --> 00:46:08,103
Yeah.

765
00:46:08,137 --> 00:46:10,103
Now, I work at Tech Fix.

766
00:46:10,137 --> 00:46:13,103
They were hirin'
and I just needed a new job.

767
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,827
What's it about?

768
00:46:17,482 --> 00:46:23,310
It's called "The Bumbling Ogre"
and it's about a little boy

769
00:46:23,344 --> 00:46:27,344
who doesn't have any friends
or at least,

770
00:46:27,413 --> 00:46:29,448
he thinks he doesn't have
any real friends,

771
00:46:29,448 --> 00:46:32,931
because they're always playing
on their phones

772
00:46:32,965 --> 00:46:35,000
and on their computer,
and he wants to go out

773
00:46:35,068 --> 00:46:36,862
and play in the woods.

774
00:46:36,931 --> 00:46:40,275
And he wants to explore
and have adventures.

775
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:42,275
His mom works all the time
and she's never home.

776
00:46:42,275 --> 00:46:45,931
So one day he's all by himself
and he decides,

777
00:46:45,931 --> 00:46:48,241
"I'm gonna head out
in the woods and play".

778
00:46:48,275 --> 00:46:49,586
So he does.

779
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:52,586
But the woods are dark, scary,

780
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:54,586
and way bigger
than he imagined,

781
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:58,482
so he finds himself lost,
and then it starts raining.

782
00:46:58,517 --> 00:47:00,517
So the little boy sees a cave
and he thinks,

783
00:47:00,586 --> 00:47:04,172
"I'm gonna go into the cave
and wait until the rain stops."

784
00:47:04,172 --> 00:47:06,068
But as he gets closer
and closer,

785
00:47:06,137 --> 00:47:09,034
he hears a terrible roar.

786
00:47:09,068 --> 00:47:11,172
And he gets scared.

787
00:47:11,206 --> 00:47:14,000
But then an ogre
sticks his head out

788
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,034
and he sees the boy,
and he says,

789
00:47:16,068 --> 00:47:19,344
"I wasn't roaring,
I was snoring."

790
00:47:21,068 --> 00:47:22,655
GREYSON:
And he tells the boy
he can come in

791
00:47:22,689 --> 00:47:25,965
and take shelter in the cave
until the rain stops,

792
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,689
because he knows what it's like.

793
00:47:29,724 --> 00:47:35,344
You see,
there once was a dark wizard

794
00:47:35,344 --> 00:47:40,310
who told the ogre to do
bad things and he did them.

795
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:48,379
And he's sorry
and now he's an outcast,

796
00:47:48,413 --> 00:47:53,517
so he understands
what the boy feels like and--

797
00:47:53,517 --> 00:47:56,137
and he wants to fix it.

798
00:47:56,172 --> 00:48:01,000
So the two of them sit
in his cave around a campfire

799
00:48:01,034 --> 00:48:05,275
and they-- they eat marshmallows
from the boy's backpack

800
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:07,137
and little by little,

801
00:48:07,206 --> 00:48:09,620
that boy is less
and less afraid.

802
00:48:09,655 --> 00:48:12,620
When the rain stops,
and they go outside,

803
00:48:12,655 --> 00:48:15,379
and the woods seem less dark,
and less scary,

804
00:48:15,413 --> 00:48:19,448
because the boy
has a real friend now.

805
00:48:19,482 --> 00:48:24,103
And the boy asks--
he asked the ogre

806
00:48:24,137 --> 00:48:27,551
if he wants to play,
and they smile at each other,

807
00:48:27,586 --> 00:48:32,068
and the ogre,
after all that time bein' alone

808
00:48:32,068 --> 00:48:35,103
in his sad cave
as nobody understands him

809
00:48:35,137 --> 00:48:38,068
and he's an outcast,
he's so happy to have a friend

810
00:48:38,103 --> 00:48:40,413
and someone to play with,
he runs out into the woods,

811
00:48:40,448 --> 00:48:41,965
and the two play, and play,
and play,

812
00:48:42,034 --> 00:48:43,965
and have a-- a grand old time.

813
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:52,310
And then night comes
and the boy asked the ogre

814
00:48:52,379 --> 00:48:54,241
if he can stay.

815
00:48:54,275 --> 00:49:01,000
And the ogre knows that
the boy's mother will be worried

816
00:49:01,068 --> 00:49:03,689
and that the dark wizard
could come back at any time,

817
00:49:03,724 --> 00:49:07,482
so he tells the boy
that he has to go home.

818
00:49:07,482 --> 00:49:11,758
And the boy, he cries,
and cries, and cries,

819
00:49:11,793 --> 00:49:14,103
because he thinks

820
00:49:14,137 --> 00:49:15,344
he's never gonna see
the ogre again,

821
00:49:15,379 --> 00:49:17,586
but the ogre tells him
he'll always be there

822
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:19,137
when he needs him

823
00:49:19,172 --> 00:49:24,310
and he will always be
his friend.

824
00:49:24,344 --> 00:49:29,275
In the end, the boy convinces
the ogre to go live with him,

825
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:33,172
so they journey together
through the woods

826
00:49:33,206 --> 00:49:34,482
towards the boy's house,

827
00:49:34,482 --> 00:49:36,137
leaving behind
the wizard's voice,

828
00:49:36,137 --> 00:49:38,344
and leaving behind
the ogre's dark cave,

829
00:49:38,379 --> 00:49:40,620
and the boy hides him
in his closet,

830
00:49:40,655 --> 00:49:45,068
and they have many grand
adventures together, but...

831
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:51,068
...the ogre's clumsy.

832
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:59,137
He's always breakin' things
and screwing things up.

833
00:49:59,172 --> 00:50:00,379
Even though he tries so hard

834
00:50:00,448 --> 00:50:02,620
and it makes him feel
really bad, but--

835
00:50:06,344 --> 00:50:08,689
But the boy loves him anyway.

836
00:50:11,137 --> 00:50:15,413
And the boy teaches him
that that's what love is.

837
00:50:16,827 --> 00:50:21,689
It's to accept someone
for who they are,

838
00:50:21,724 --> 00:50:26,034
and he helps them
to finally break the spell,

839
00:50:26,103 --> 00:50:28,517
and they leave the dark wizard
behind forever.

840
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:35,172
And the two live happily
ever after.

841
00:50:35,206 --> 00:50:39,793
Uh, the boy
and the bumbling ogre.

842
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:49,482
You're not an ogre, Grey.

843
00:50:52,448 --> 00:50:54,034
I know.

844
00:50:55,655 --> 00:50:59,310
Just a story,
it's a kid's book.

845
00:50:59,344 --> 00:51:03,103
But duh, the wizard's real.

846
00:51:07,241 --> 00:51:13,344
It's a great story,
and the artwork is amazing,

847
00:51:13,379 --> 00:51:19,413
and the moral is important,
and um--

848
00:51:23,206 --> 00:51:25,689
I bet you're a really great dad.

849
00:51:28,827 --> 00:51:30,758
My ex-wife doesn't think so.

850
00:51:34,482 --> 00:51:35,689
What?

851
00:51:35,724 --> 00:51:37,344
Dinner.

852
00:51:37,379 --> 00:51:39,172
I'm hungry.

853
00:51:39,206 --> 00:51:40,689
Everybody else seemed
to actually like,

854
00:51:40,724 --> 00:51:43,413
"No", like they were following
along with the events.

855
00:51:43,448 --> 00:51:45,172
They knew
it was a used cough drop--

856
00:51:45,206 --> 00:51:46,068
Mmhmm.

857
00:51:46,068 --> 00:51:48,241
He had smacked
out of his mouth, um--

858
00:51:49,517 --> 00:51:51,724
Except for me, 'cause like
when I hear like noises goin'

859
00:51:51,758 --> 00:51:54,448
I tend to just like you know,
move my--

860
00:52:07,241 --> 00:52:08,758
Is that me?

861
00:52:14,413 --> 00:52:15,413
Good morning.

862
00:52:15,448 --> 00:52:17,586
Good morning.

863
00:52:24,482 --> 00:52:26,827
So we probably shouldn't go
to work together.

864
00:52:27,931 --> 00:52:29,517
Yeah.

865
00:52:29,586 --> 00:52:31,896
We've already talked too much.

866
00:52:31,931 --> 00:52:33,827
Yeah.

867
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:41,758
Do you wanna drive me back
to my car?

868
00:52:41,758 --> 00:52:43,448
- Okay.
-

869
00:52:43,448 --> 00:52:45,275
- Alright.
-

870
00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:46,931
Let's go.

871
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I had a great time last night,
really.

872
00:53:12,034 --> 00:53:13,000
Me, too.

873
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Okay.

874
00:53:17,034 --> 00:53:18,482
Oh.

875
00:53:28,827 --> 00:53:30,724
We should do this again
sometime.

876
00:53:30,793 --> 00:53:32,344
Yeah, I'd like that.

877
00:53:34,517 --> 00:53:39,344
Just um, don't tell anyone
at work about this, please.

878
00:53:41,655 --> 00:53:44,000
- You're embarrassed?
- No!

879
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,655
It's just--

880
00:53:46,689 --> 00:53:48,034
I don't want people talking
about it.

881
00:53:48,068 --> 00:53:51,517
I don't want either of us
to get in trouble and--

882
00:53:51,517 --> 00:53:53,551
- People are already talking.
- Hmm.

883
00:53:53,586 --> 00:53:54,551
You know, office gossip, it's--

884
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:56,689
Okay.

885
00:53:56,724 --> 00:53:57,827
What?

886
00:53:57,827 --> 00:54:00,310
I said, "Okay".

887
00:54:00,344 --> 00:54:02,517
Don't okay me on this.

888
00:54:02,551 --> 00:54:03,724
I mean it.

889
00:54:09,068 --> 00:54:10,586
GREYSON:
Zoey!

890
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:12,551
Do you regret it?

891
00:54:12,551 --> 00:54:14,551
No.

892
00:54:14,586 --> 00:54:15,758
Neither do I.

893
00:54:15,793 --> 00:54:18,689
So let's just go to work
like normal.

894
00:54:22,482 --> 00:54:23,965
What kind of a router
are you currently using

895
00:54:24,034 --> 00:54:26,379
right now?

896
00:54:28,379 --> 00:54:30,517
Good morning.

897
00:54:30,551 --> 00:54:32,862
Good morning.

898
00:54:32,896 --> 00:54:34,482
Go clock in.

899
00:54:34,551 --> 00:54:36,517
- Yeah, I should--
- Yeah.

900
00:54:37,896 --> 00:54:40,689
Oh.

901
00:54:40,724 --> 00:54:41,896
I think you dropped this.

902
00:54:41,896 --> 00:54:44,896
Thanks.

903
00:54:46,689 --> 00:54:47,689
Morning, Kate.

904
00:54:47,724 --> 00:54:48,724
Hmm.

905
00:54:51,551 --> 00:54:52,965
Hmm?

906
00:54:53,034 --> 00:54:54,793
- What?
- Nothing.

907
00:54:59,068 --> 00:55:01,137
- Keep up.
- Yeah, it's over.

908
00:55:01,137 --> 00:55:02,448
- Anyways--
- Yes, I'm sorry about that.

909
00:55:02,482 --> 00:55:03,655
I'm sorry about, man,
I am so sorry.

910
00:55:03,655 --> 00:55:04,793
Mmhmm, I don't know
to be honest,

911
00:55:04,827 --> 00:55:07,448
but here's what we'll do.

912
00:55:07,482 --> 00:55:08,655
- Here's what we'll do--
- Why don't we--

913
00:55:08,689 --> 00:55:10,724
-

914
00:55:10,793 --> 00:55:14,000
Why don't we start over again
and let's just-

915
00:55:14,034 --> 00:55:15,068
let's just take--

916
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,620
So?

917
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:26,482
Yeah, you, Grey.

918
00:55:26,482 --> 00:55:27,793
- What?
- She suck your dick?

919
00:55:29,482 --> 00:55:32,103
- What?
- Zoey.

920
00:55:32,137 --> 00:55:34,965
- The office slut.
- Don't call her that.

921
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,689
We went out, and we had coffee,
and-- and dinner,

922
00:55:38,724 --> 00:55:40,793
- we had a nice time.
- It was nice.

923
00:55:40,827 --> 00:55:41,827
What's your problem?

924
00:55:41,862 --> 00:55:43,689
You weren't her first, Grey.

925
00:55:43,758 --> 00:55:45,827
I already tapped that shit.

926
00:55:45,862 --> 00:55:47,517
- You're lying.
- Am I?

927
00:55:52,965 --> 00:55:55,482
She was mine first, Grey.

928
00:55:55,482 --> 00:55:59,000
Think about that next time
you kiss her, bitch.

929
00:56:06,827 --> 00:56:08,862
Hey.

930
00:56:08,862 --> 00:56:09,793
Hey yourself.

931
00:56:09,862 --> 00:56:11,724
I'd like to see you after work
on Monday.

932
00:56:11,724 --> 00:56:13,103
Maybe we can get ice cream
or something?

933
00:56:13,172 --> 00:56:14,896
Yeah, ice cream.

934
00:56:17,517 --> 00:56:18,862
I like ice cream.

935
00:56:18,862 --> 00:56:20,586
Good.

936
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:23,689
- It's a date.
- Okay.

937
00:56:23,724 --> 00:56:24,758
Monday.

938
00:56:26,586 --> 00:56:30,103
Hey, Grey, you know,
you can text me, right?

939
00:56:30,172 --> 00:56:32,586
Like over the weekend.

940
00:56:42,551 --> 00:56:45,965
I don't care what people say.

941
00:56:46,034 --> 00:56:47,689
Yeah, now, it's not really
the time or the place--

942
00:56:47,724 --> 00:56:51,551
Well, I just want you to know
I don't care.

943
00:56:55,793 --> 00:56:58,000
I'm tired of caring
what people think.

944
00:57:01,172 --> 00:57:02,620
You look pretty today.

945
00:57:02,655 --> 00:57:05,137
Thank you.

946
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:06,482
Bye.

947
00:57:20,931 --> 00:57:21,965
I'm here, I'm here.

948
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,137
I'm sorry I'm late, I'm sorry.

949
00:57:24,172 --> 00:57:25,172
Hey.

950
00:57:26,586 --> 00:57:28,000
I'm here.

951
00:57:28,793 --> 00:57:29,931
SARAH:
James stayed home today.

952
00:57:29,931 --> 00:57:31,896
Didn't you get Marilyn's text?

953
00:57:36,931 --> 00:57:39,551
Sorry.

954
00:57:39,586 --> 00:57:40,896
Oh.

955
00:57:40,931 --> 00:57:43,586
Yeah, here it is.

956
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:45,206
I must've just not seen it.

957
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,827
Okay, uh, bye.

958
00:58:03,965 --> 00:58:06,551
Fuck, fuck, fuck,
fucker, fucker!

959
00:58:16,275 --> 00:58:17,275
Hello?

960
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:36,896
- Mom?
- Grey.

961
00:58:36,965 --> 00:58:38,586
GREYSON:
What are you doing here?

962
00:58:38,655 --> 00:58:39,689
I thought
I'd come see my grandson--

963
00:58:39,689 --> 00:58:41,310
- Hey, daddy!
- Oh, hey, buddy.

964
00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:45,172
How are you?

965
00:58:45,206 --> 00:58:49,000
Why don't you get
your backpack ready, little man?

966
00:58:49,034 --> 00:58:51,034
- Okay.
- Go upstairs.

967
00:58:54,206 --> 00:58:56,344
What's going on?

968
00:58:56,344 --> 00:59:00,896
Grey, why can't you just
try harder?

969
00:59:02,034 --> 00:59:03,862
CAROL:
James is such
a wonderful little kid,

970
00:59:03,896 --> 00:59:05,862
he needs a father.

971
00:59:05,896 --> 00:59:08,068
He has his father.

972
00:59:08,103 --> 00:59:10,034
CAROL:
Oh, does he?

973
00:59:10,068 --> 00:59:16,137
You know, I love you, Grey,
I really do,

974
00:59:16,206 --> 00:59:18,620
but we never should
have had you.

975
00:59:18,689 --> 00:59:22,137
I let you down, Grey.

976
00:59:22,206 --> 00:59:24,793
That's my legacy.

977
00:59:24,862 --> 00:59:26,724
Now, you're doing
the same damn thing

978
00:59:26,724 --> 00:59:29,379
with your family.

979
00:59:29,413 --> 00:59:32,965
I'm doing the best that I can.

980
00:59:35,068 --> 00:59:36,689
That's what concerns me.

981
00:59:36,724 --> 00:59:40,413
I'm a good dad.

982
00:59:40,448 --> 00:59:45,103
You know, what they um,
called kids like you

983
00:59:45,137 --> 00:59:48,724
when I was still teaching?

984
00:59:48,758 --> 00:59:53,793
"Wasted potential".

985
00:59:53,827 --> 00:59:57,655
Still drawing pictures
and telling stories.

986
00:59:57,724 --> 00:59:59,413
I like drawing.
It makes me happy.

987
00:59:59,413 --> 01:00:01,137
Doesn't happiness count
for anything?

988
01:00:01,206 --> 01:00:03,275
James likes my art,
we're makin' a book together.

989
01:00:04,793 --> 01:00:09,655
And how's that working out
for you?

990
01:00:09,724 --> 01:00:14,172
Oh, you're such an angry
little kid.

991
01:00:15,310 --> 01:00:18,758
And you're still angry.

992
01:00:18,758 --> 01:00:21,724
Maybe that's your real
fucking legacy, huh?

993
01:00:21,724 --> 01:00:23,931
Well, maybe it is.

994
01:00:28,241 --> 01:00:32,241
You are responsible
for your actions.

995
01:00:32,275 --> 01:00:38,413
You are responsible
for where you are in life

996
01:00:38,448 --> 01:00:40,862
not anybody else.

997
01:00:43,137 --> 01:00:49,241
No, the world
doesn't owe you anything.

998
01:00:50,931 --> 01:00:55,965
It doesn't owe you shit.

999
01:00:56,034 --> 01:00:58,965
Sometimes I can't even stand
to look at you.

1000
01:01:02,448 --> 01:01:05,758
CAROL:
Stand up and be a man
for God's sake!

1001
01:01:10,034 --> 01:01:12,724
Hey!

1002
01:01:12,793 --> 01:01:15,965
Why don't you uh, go out
and play some baseball

1003
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,965
and get some exercise.

1004
01:01:20,137 --> 01:01:21,241
Hey bud, ready to go?

1005
01:01:21,275 --> 01:01:23,034
Yeah.

1006
01:01:23,103 --> 01:01:25,206
But stay away
from that damn book.

1007
01:01:25,275 --> 01:01:26,275
Come on, let's go.

1008
01:02:04,413 --> 01:02:05,551
Good job, buddy.

1009
01:02:05,586 --> 01:02:07,275
You can put that in the jar
when we get home, okay?

1010
01:03:00,448 --> 01:03:04,275
"And then Prince Ernest
and all the prince's men

1011
01:03:04,275 --> 01:03:07,413
raced across the drawbridge
into the castle

1012
01:03:07,448 --> 01:03:09,896
where Princess Emily
was waiting,

1013
01:03:09,931 --> 01:03:12,482
but she had a surprise."

1014
01:03:15,379 --> 01:03:16,551
Aww!

1015
01:03:18,448 --> 01:03:21,000
That's it for tonight, bud,
it's past your bedtime.

1016
01:03:21,068 --> 01:03:22,586
But what happened next?

1017
01:03:22,586 --> 01:03:24,103
We can read more tomorrow.

1018
01:03:24,103 --> 01:03:26,000
It's time for sleep.

1019
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:26,931
Okay?

1020
01:03:26,931 --> 01:03:28,137
Okay.

1021
01:03:28,172 --> 01:03:29,344
Alright, goodnight, buddy.

1022
01:03:29,413 --> 01:03:30,965
Goodnight, dad.

1023
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Love you more than ice cream.

1024
01:03:33,068 --> 01:03:35,827
Love you more than cake.

1025
01:03:35,896 --> 01:03:38,896
Love you more
than ice cream cake.

1026
01:03:38,931 --> 01:03:40,137
That's not your thing.

1027
01:03:40,172 --> 01:03:41,965
You're makin' that up.

1028
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,241
Yeah, it's time for bed.

1029
01:03:43,275 --> 01:03:44,413
We can go to the fair tomorrow,
okay?

1030
01:03:44,448 --> 01:03:45,448
Okay.

1031
01:03:45,482 --> 01:03:47,275
- Goodnight.
- Night light.

1032
01:03:47,275 --> 01:03:48,793
Yeah, I'll put it on right now.

1033
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,172
JAMES:
Dad.

1034
01:03:53,241 --> 01:03:55,103
Yeah?

1035
01:03:55,137 --> 01:03:57,896
JAMES:
We're not going to Disneyland,
are we?

1036
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:04,379
Yes, we are, I promise.

1037
01:04:04,413 --> 01:04:07,206
JAMES:
It's okay
you can't afford it, dad.

1038
01:04:09,172 --> 01:04:11,517
James.

1039
01:04:11,551 --> 01:04:13,379
Son, look at me.

1040
01:04:15,241 --> 01:04:18,344
We're going to Disneyland.

1041
01:04:18,379 --> 01:04:20,965
I promise.

1042
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,965
We just have to save up
for it first.

1043
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,655
Every penny matters.

1044
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:28,896
That's right, son.

1045
01:04:33,172 --> 01:04:35,310
Did you take the money, daddy?

1046
01:04:41,172 --> 01:04:42,344
Go to bed.

1047
01:04:49,517 --> 01:04:51,068
I don't know, I want 'em all.

1048
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:52,551
Well, you better get
what you can

1049
01:04:52,586 --> 01:04:54,689
while you got a chance
before the laws change,

1050
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:56,965
'cause it's really only
a matter of time.

1051
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,344
Hey.

1052
01:04:58,344 --> 01:05:00,241
Hey, Mr. Bill, how you doin'
this fine evenin'?

1053
01:05:00,310 --> 01:05:01,344
Yeah, yeah.

1054
01:05:03,241 --> 01:05:03,724
Fine.

1055
01:05:03,758 --> 01:05:05,241
What's all this?

1056
01:05:05,275 --> 01:05:08,413
WINSLOW:
This is my fine selection
of firearms.

1057
01:05:08,448 --> 01:05:10,206
We're gonna be shootin'
these on Sunday.

1058
01:05:10,241 --> 01:05:11,482
Like I said before,
it'd be really cool

1059
01:05:11,551 --> 01:05:12,689
if you could join us.

1060
01:05:12,724 --> 01:05:14,724
We will have a good time.

1061
01:05:14,758 --> 01:05:17,206
- Are these things loaded?
- LIAM: No, no.

1062
01:05:17,241 --> 01:05:18,275
Because my son is right there

1063
01:05:18,344 --> 01:05:19,724
and I really don't feel
comfortable with you guys

1064
01:05:19,758 --> 01:05:20,965
having these in the house

1065
01:05:21,034 --> 01:05:22,241
- and I'm--
- LIAM: No, no.

1066
01:05:22,275 --> 01:05:25,655
Only gun I ever carry loaded
is right here in my holster.

1067
01:05:25,724 --> 01:05:27,448
You guys are shooting
all of these on Sunday?

1068
01:05:28,448 --> 01:05:30,275
Yes, sir, we are.

1069
01:05:30,310 --> 01:05:31,965
Every damn one of 'em.

1070
01:05:32,034 --> 01:05:34,310
- You should come.
- No, I can't.

1071
01:05:34,379 --> 01:05:36,620
Well, I'm buyin'
the assault rifle on Friday.

1072
01:05:36,655 --> 01:05:38,103
I think it'd be good to have
a firearm around

1073
01:05:38,137 --> 01:05:39,517
for the protection, you know?

1074
01:05:39,551 --> 01:05:41,241
For home protection?

1075
01:05:41,275 --> 01:05:43,241
You need one of these
for home protection?

1076
01:05:43,275 --> 01:05:44,758
From what, a bear?

1077
01:05:44,758 --> 01:05:47,379
We do live in uncertain times,
Mr. Bell.

1078
01:05:47,413 --> 01:05:49,965
Liam, my son is right there.

1079
01:05:50,034 --> 01:05:51,034
I don't feel comfortable
with you

1080
01:05:51,068 --> 01:05:53,482
having this in the house.

1081
01:05:53,551 --> 01:05:56,379
I'm also buyin' a trigger lock
and a locking gun case.

1082
01:06:02,275 --> 01:06:06,517
WINSLOW:
Safe as rain, Mr. Bell,
I guaran-damn-tee it.

1083
01:06:06,551 --> 01:06:08,310
Hey, I'm gonna step out
for a smoke.

1084
01:06:08,344 --> 01:06:10,241
You guys cool?

1085
01:06:10,275 --> 01:06:11,413
Yeah.

1086
01:06:11,448 --> 01:06:13,103
Awesome.

1087
01:06:17,655 --> 01:06:20,655
So you buy and sell
these things?

1088
01:06:20,655 --> 01:06:23,517
I mean you got a shitload
of guns.

1089
01:06:23,551 --> 01:06:26,482
You interested in purchasin'
a firearm or sellin' them,

1090
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:30,103
- for that matter.
- No, no.

1091
01:06:30,137 --> 01:06:31,172
Well--

1092
01:06:33,103 --> 01:06:36,137
It's my card, as they say.

1093
01:06:36,172 --> 01:06:38,827
Got all my complete
contact information on there.

1094
01:06:38,827 --> 01:06:40,482
All that pertinent information
is located right there

1095
01:06:40,482 --> 01:06:42,655
in front of the card.

1096
01:06:42,689 --> 01:06:44,827
And on the back of the card.

1097
01:06:44,862 --> 01:06:47,275
That there's a picture
of an M1 Abrams tank.

1098
01:06:48,620 --> 01:06:49,793
I know.

1099
01:06:52,379 --> 01:06:55,379
Give me a call if you change
your mind, Mr. Bell.

1100
01:06:55,448 --> 01:06:58,344
I'd be here within the hour
with guns in hand.

1101
01:06:58,379 --> 01:07:00,344
Or cash to buy
if you're sellin'.

1102
01:07:00,344 --> 01:07:01,862
Okay.

1103
01:07:01,896 --> 01:07:03,724
What about background checks?

1104
01:07:05,551 --> 01:07:06,758
What about 'em?

1105
01:07:11,896 --> 01:07:15,724
Hey, I also carry about
10 grand in cash

1106
01:07:15,758 --> 01:07:20,034
at all times for that
more discreet customer.

1107
01:07:23,241 --> 01:07:25,241
I do have some very important
business to discuss

1108
01:07:25,275 --> 01:07:27,379
- with my compatriot Liam.
- Mmhmm.

1109
01:07:27,379 --> 01:07:28,758
You'll excuse me Mr. Bell.

1110
01:07:28,827 --> 01:07:30,413
I'll talk to you later.

1111
01:07:30,448 --> 01:07:31,724
You got my card,
you can give a call

1112
01:07:31,758 --> 01:07:33,344
if you change your mind.

1113
01:07:33,379 --> 01:07:34,344
Okay.

1114
01:08:41,551 --> 01:08:42,931
What do want to do, bud?

1115
01:08:44,655 --> 01:08:45,758
Yeah.

1116
01:08:52,655 --> 01:08:53,724
Oh, look at this one,
that's a goat.

1117
01:08:53,758 --> 01:08:54,931
- Do you see him?
- Yeah.

1118
01:08:54,931 --> 01:08:55,931
Yeah.

1119
01:09:36,896 --> 01:09:40,517
"And Prince Ernest knew
what he must do.

1120
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:45,000
Climb to the top
of Midnight Mountain."

1121
01:09:46,827 --> 01:09:48,689
That is it for tonight.

1122
01:09:48,724 --> 01:09:50,689
- Time for bed, okay?
- Okay.

1123
01:09:50,724 --> 01:09:52,827
Here, lay down
and get all covered up.

1124
01:09:52,827 --> 01:09:55,000
Alright, got your dinosaur.

1125
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,620
- Good?
- Yeah.

1126
01:09:56,655 --> 01:09:57,655
Alright.

1127
01:10:01,482 --> 01:10:02,793
Love you, buddy.

1128
01:10:02,827 --> 01:10:04,241
Goodnight, dad.

1129
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:05,551
Love you.

1130
01:10:05,586 --> 01:10:07,827
Love you more than ice cream.

1131
01:10:07,862 --> 01:10:10,724
More than birthday cake
ice cream?

1132
01:10:10,793 --> 01:10:11,724
Yeah.

1133
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:14,862
Alright, goodnight,
go to sleep.

1134
01:11:03,068 --> 01:11:04,068
Get your backpack, James.

1135
01:11:04,068 --> 01:11:05,586
Don't leave it out here.

1136
01:11:05,586 --> 01:11:07,724
Go on inside
and put it your room.

1137
01:11:07,724 --> 01:11:08,931
- Hey.
- Hey.

1138
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:10,551
Did you guys have
a good weekend?

1139
01:11:10,551 --> 01:11:11,413
Yeah.

1140
01:11:11,448 --> 01:11:14,310
Good, I'm glad.

1141
01:11:14,379 --> 01:11:15,758
Sorry, we're late.

1142
01:11:15,793 --> 01:11:16,896
That's okay.

1143
01:11:16,931 --> 01:11:18,413
It's--

1144
01:11:18,448 --> 01:11:22,517
- Is my mom still here?
- No.

1145
01:11:22,551 --> 01:11:25,551
What was she doing here?

1146
01:11:25,586 --> 01:11:27,310
She was helping me pack.

1147
01:11:27,379 --> 01:11:29,724
Pack, for what?

1148
01:11:30,655 --> 01:11:32,689
Come on inside, Grey,
we need to talk.

1149
01:11:35,689 --> 01:11:37,931
Grey, close the door.

1150
01:11:37,965 --> 01:11:39,206
James, go to your room, honey.

1151
01:11:39,241 --> 01:11:41,896
Mommy wants to talk to daddy
in private for a minute, okay?

1152
01:11:48,068 --> 01:11:51,724
So what's going on?

1153
01:11:53,413 --> 01:11:55,862
- We're moving, Grey.
- Oh, okay.

1154
01:11:55,896 --> 01:12:00,586
Um, you need my help
moving stuff or--

1155
01:12:02,482 --> 01:12:04,724
It's California.

1156
01:12:04,793 --> 01:12:09,517
My job had a management opening
in San Pedro, I applied,

1157
01:12:09,551 --> 01:12:14,000
I was a perfect candidate,
and I got the job.

1158
01:12:14,034 --> 01:12:17,620
Okay, it's a good job,
it's a huge salary increase,

1159
01:12:17,655 --> 01:12:20,620
and they'll help pay for us
to relocate.

1160
01:12:20,655 --> 01:12:22,827
I can finally take James
to Disneyland.

1161
01:12:22,827 --> 01:12:24,758
I was gonna take James
to Disneyland.

1162
01:12:24,793 --> 01:12:27,000
No, you weren't, Grey.

1163
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,689
You've been stringing him along
for two years now.

1164
01:12:29,758 --> 01:12:31,965
Putting pennies in a jar?

1165
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,379
Are you for real?

1166
01:12:34,448 --> 01:12:35,655
He knows you're broke, Grey.

1167
01:12:35,655 --> 01:12:37,620
He's not stupid, okay?
He knows.

1168
01:12:37,655 --> 01:12:38,689
I'm looking for another job.

1169
01:12:38,758 --> 01:12:40,586
Stop it, okay?

1170
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:42,103
Just stop!

1171
01:12:42,137 --> 01:12:44,379
You're not looking
for a better job,

1172
01:12:44,448 --> 01:12:46,862
you're not taking him
to Disneyland.

1173
01:12:46,896 --> 01:12:51,000
You're breaking his heart
and he loves you.

1174
01:12:51,034 --> 01:12:53,517
Okay, I don't wanna fight
about this anymore.

1175
01:12:53,551 --> 01:12:54,896
We're workin'
on our book together.

1176
01:12:54,965 --> 01:12:56,793
As soon as it's done,
then we're gonna sell it,

1177
01:12:56,827 --> 01:12:57,827
- and I'm gonna--
- Your book?

1178
01:12:57,862 --> 01:13:00,379
- Your-- your stupid ogre book?
- Yes, our--

1179
01:13:00,448 --> 01:13:01,689
The one that you
you've been working on

1180
01:13:01,689 --> 01:13:03,000
- since he was born?
- Yeah--

1181
01:13:03,034 --> 01:13:04,000
- That book?
- Yes, that book.

1182
01:13:04,034 --> 01:13:05,103
We're workin' on it together--

1183
01:13:05,172 --> 01:13:06,793
And as soon as it's finished,
we're gonna sell it.

1184
01:13:06,862 --> 01:13:10,827
Grey, just stop and listen
to yourself, okay?

1185
01:13:10,862 --> 01:13:13,689
I can't wait for you anymore.

1186
01:13:20,586 --> 01:13:26,034
Grey, I have waited for you
for almost two years.

1187
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:30,517
I have sat here day after day
and night after night,

1188
01:13:30,551 --> 01:13:32,620
watching you break
our son's heart

1189
01:13:32,689 --> 01:13:35,448
by being a failure
who can't even afford

1190
01:13:35,517 --> 01:13:38,068
to take care of his family.

1191
01:13:38,103 --> 01:13:39,206
Look at you!

1192
01:13:39,206 --> 01:13:42,068
You can't even take care
of yourself!

1193
01:13:42,103 --> 01:13:45,034
And I've given up on you, Grey.

1194
01:13:45,068 --> 01:13:49,793
I have finally realized that
this is who you are.

1195
01:13:49,862 --> 01:13:53,689
I am sorry, but we are moving
and we're never coming back.

1196
01:13:53,724 --> 01:13:55,517
I told you that I'm lookin'
for another job.

1197
01:13:56,517 --> 01:13:59,137
I'm gonna figure something out,
okay?

1198
01:13:59,206 --> 01:14:01,103
I can start paying more towards
his daycare if that helps.

1199
01:14:01,137 --> 01:14:04,000
It's too late, Grey.

1200
01:14:04,068 --> 01:14:07,655
Are you taking your meds?

1201
01:14:07,724 --> 01:14:11,000
No, I-- I can't afford 'em.

1202
01:14:11,068 --> 01:14:13,241
You can't afford them?

1203
01:14:13,275 --> 01:14:16,137
Tell me, Grey,
what can you afford, huh?

1204
01:14:16,172 --> 01:14:20,896
What can Mr. Greyson Bell,
fabulous artist, afford?

1205
01:14:20,931 --> 01:14:21,965
I'll be fine.

1206
01:14:22,034 --> 01:14:24,620
I just have to make it
through a couple of weeks.

1207
01:14:24,655 --> 01:14:26,000
MARILYN:
A couple of weeks?

1208
01:14:26,068 --> 01:14:28,103
Didn't you say
a couple of weeks last week?

1209
01:14:28,137 --> 01:14:30,103
And this week,
and then next paycheck,

1210
01:14:30,137 --> 01:14:31,482
and next month?

1211
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:33,103
What about now?

1212
01:14:33,103 --> 01:14:35,172
I'll start paying child support.

1213
01:14:35,241 --> 01:14:37,793
- Is that what you want?
- I don't want child support!

1214
01:14:37,793 --> 01:14:40,586
I don't want anything from you,
I never have.

1215
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:45,586
All I wanted was you
to be a man, and a father,

1216
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:48,724
and to provide for his son!

1217
01:14:48,758 --> 01:14:50,620
MARILYN:
I wanted you.

1218
01:14:58,586 --> 01:15:00,793
I'm trying.

1219
01:15:00,827 --> 01:15:02,551
No, you're not!

1220
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:03,965
Don't you dare say that!

1221
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,689
I don't you dare put this on me!

1222
01:15:06,689 --> 01:15:08,655
MARILYN:
This is on you, Grey, you!

1223
01:15:11,034 --> 01:15:15,310
This is who you are, this is all
you'll ever amount to.

1224
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:16,827
Are you happy?

1225
01:15:16,827 --> 01:15:18,896
Are you fuckin' happy?

1226
01:15:18,965 --> 01:15:20,827
Okay, I said it.

1227
01:15:20,827 --> 01:15:23,000
- I can't--
- No.

1228
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,344
Yeah, well, neither am I.

1229
01:15:31,206 --> 01:15:33,827
Why are you looking
at your phone?

1230
01:15:33,862 --> 01:15:35,206
It's not like you've paid
your bill in months,

1231
01:15:35,241 --> 01:15:38,172
you don't even have service!

1232
01:15:38,172 --> 01:15:42,172
This is exactly the kind of shit
that I'm talking about!

1233
01:15:42,206 --> 01:15:45,137
You can't just go on pretending
everything's okay

1234
01:15:45,172 --> 01:15:47,000
like nobody notices.

1235
01:15:53,689 --> 01:15:54,896
Please.

1236
01:15:59,862 --> 01:16:03,724
Please, don't take my son away.

1237
01:16:03,758 --> 01:16:05,620
Please, he's the only good thing

1238
01:16:05,689 --> 01:16:09,068
I have left in my life, please.

1239
01:16:09,068 --> 01:16:10,379
Please, don't take him away.

1240
01:16:10,413 --> 01:16:12,965
No, we're moving to California,
you can come visit him there.

1241
01:16:13,034 --> 01:16:14,413
I can't afford that.

1242
01:16:14,413 --> 01:16:16,137
Then get a better job!

1243
01:16:16,206 --> 01:16:18,310
I'll get an attorney.

1244
01:16:18,379 --> 01:16:20,103
You can't even afford
to feed your son

1245
01:16:20,137 --> 01:16:23,034
and you're threatening me
with an attorney!

1246
01:16:23,068 --> 01:16:25,068
Go to hell, Grey!

1247
01:16:25,103 --> 01:16:26,896
He deserves a better father
than you.

1248
01:16:26,896 --> 01:16:27,862
Don't say that!

1249
01:16:33,068 --> 01:16:36,896
JAMES:
Daddy, stop, don't hurt mommy.

1250
01:16:36,931 --> 01:16:38,413
MARILYN:
Grey, please go away.

1251
01:16:38,448 --> 01:16:41,137
Don't ever, ever come back.

1252
01:16:41,206 --> 01:16:42,724
Just go.

1253
01:16:44,103 --> 01:16:46,034
Go!

1254
01:16:55,275 --> 01:16:56,896
GREYSON:
Yes, I understand that
it's closed on the weekend,

1255
01:16:56,931 --> 01:16:58,206
but this is an emergency.

1256
01:17:01,103 --> 01:17:03,827
Yes.

1257
01:17:03,862 --> 01:17:05,103
Well, how much would that cost?

1258
01:17:09,275 --> 01:17:10,965
Wait--

1259
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,793
It costs how much to--
to file in court on Monday?

1260
01:17:21,034 --> 01:17:22,068
No, I--

1261
01:17:26,310 --> 01:17:28,103
No, I don't have any money.

1262
01:17:31,137 --> 01:17:34,310
I don't know what else to do,
please, I need help.

1263
01:17:40,379 --> 01:17:42,103
She's gonna take my son.

1264
01:20:08,344 --> 01:20:10,275
Hey, Mr. Bell.

1265
01:20:10,275 --> 01:20:13,344
How you doin' this fine evenin'?

1266
01:20:13,413 --> 01:20:16,448
Where's my partner in crime?

1267
01:20:16,448 --> 01:20:17,965
My dear friend and colleague
Mr. Brady,

1268
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,448
where's he at tonight?

1269
01:20:20,448 --> 01:20:22,965
Oh man, we had a hell
of a time shootin' today.

1270
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,931
It's a damn shame
you couldn't make it.

1271
01:20:25,931 --> 01:20:28,275
He's with Janice.

1272
01:20:28,275 --> 01:20:29,310
WINSLOW:
No shit.

1273
01:20:30,206 --> 01:20:33,275
Well, he is quite
the ladies' man.

1274
01:20:33,275 --> 01:20:35,931
As I'm sure you are, too,
Mr. Bell,

1275
01:20:35,931 --> 01:20:37,241
speakin' of the ladies.

1276
01:20:40,068 --> 01:20:41,103
You can almost fit
this little bastard

1277
01:20:41,103 --> 01:20:42,103
in your boot.

1278
01:20:44,482 --> 01:20:47,448
Check that out.

1279
01:20:47,448 --> 01:20:49,068
That's pretty good convenient.

1280
01:20:49,103 --> 01:20:50,413
Hmm.

1281
01:20:52,413 --> 01:20:54,586
What about one like yours?

1282
01:20:54,620 --> 01:20:57,344
My 9 mil?

1283
01:20:57,413 --> 01:21:01,068
It's got some decent
stoppin' power in this one.

1284
01:21:01,137 --> 01:21:02,413
I got a couple in my selection
right now

1285
01:21:02,482 --> 01:21:04,482
if you're interested.

1286
01:21:04,482 --> 01:21:06,482
Can I see it?

1287
01:21:06,482 --> 01:21:07,551
Have a hand at it.

1288
01:21:11,379 --> 01:21:15,241
Use two hands,
you'd be more accurate.

1289
01:21:15,310 --> 01:21:16,275
There you go.

1290
01:21:16,344 --> 01:21:21,000
Wanna close that left eye,
sight that sucker.

1291
01:21:21,034 --> 01:21:22,068
Uh-huh.

1292
01:21:22,137 --> 01:21:23,482
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1293
01:21:27,206 --> 01:21:29,689
Do you have more bullets
for these?

1294
01:21:29,689 --> 01:21:32,034
WINSLOW:
Hell yeah, I got some out
in my truck right now.

1295
01:21:32,068 --> 01:21:35,413
I can get you some ammo
for that HK.

1296
01:21:35,482 --> 01:21:37,068
Enough rounds for that bad boy
to take you

1297
01:21:37,137 --> 01:21:41,068
right through the apocalypse,
reliable.

1298
01:21:41,137 --> 01:21:44,931
Cash is okay?

1299
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,344
WINSLOW:
Cash is legal currency,
Mr. Bell.

1300
01:21:48,379 --> 01:21:51,344
Okay.

1301
01:21:51,379 --> 01:21:54,689
I want one like this,
and some bullets for it,

1302
01:21:54,724 --> 01:21:57,482
and bullets for the--
the one that Liam got.

1303
01:21:59,172 --> 01:22:00,448
We're going shooting.

1304
01:22:00,517 --> 01:22:02,965
No shit!

1305
01:22:03,034 --> 01:22:05,310
Well, fuck it, hey.

1306
01:22:05,379 --> 01:22:07,068
I'll go get some ammo
out of my truck right now.

1307
01:22:07,068 --> 01:22:10,068
You sit tight.

1308
01:22:10,103 --> 01:22:12,413
You know, Mr. Bell,
I do gotta ask though,

1309
01:22:12,448 --> 01:22:14,724
you sure this is a good idea?

1310
01:22:14,758 --> 01:22:17,551
You got enough cash for this
here transaction you know,

1311
01:22:17,586 --> 01:22:19,310
'cause I have been led
to believe that times

1312
01:22:19,379 --> 01:22:22,206
are kinda tough
and cash ain't flowin'

1313
01:22:22,241 --> 01:22:25,206
so well anymore.

1314
01:22:25,241 --> 01:22:29,620
I don't have any money,
but you do and I need it.

1315
01:22:29,689 --> 01:22:30,724
I'm taking my son to Disneyland.

1316
01:22:30,724 --> 01:22:32,103
Oh, Mr. Bell.

1317
01:22:32,137 --> 01:22:33,310
No, just wait a minute.

1318
01:22:33,379 --> 01:22:34,206
I don't actually ha--

1319
01:22:34,241 --> 01:22:36,448
-

1320
01:23:44,655 --> 01:23:48,758
You're broken, daddy.

1321
01:23:48,793 --> 01:23:50,413
You're right, son.

1322
01:25:57,586 --> 01:25:58,482
Grey.

1323
01:26:00,310 --> 01:26:02,862
Are you okay?
Are you sick?

1324
01:26:02,896 --> 01:26:04,724
No.

1325
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:09,310
I can hear the wizard.

1326
01:26:14,655 --> 01:26:17,310
Dude, answer your phone!

1327
01:26:19,862 --> 01:26:22,241
Putting pennies in a jar?

1328
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:23,413
Are you for real?

1329
01:26:24,620 --> 01:26:25,689
He knows you're broke, Grey.

1330
01:26:25,724 --> 01:26:27,344
He's not stupid, okay?

1331
01:26:27,379 --> 01:26:30,551
You're breaking his heart
and he loves you.

1332
01:26:30,586 --> 01:26:32,689
You're not looking
for a better job.

1333
01:26:32,724 --> 01:26:34,827
You're not taking him
to Disneyland.

1334
01:26:43,827 --> 01:26:46,586
Sometimes I can't even stand
to look at you.

1335
01:26:46,655 --> 01:26:50,689
The world
doesn't owe you anything.

1336
01:26:50,724 --> 01:26:53,379
It doesn't owe you shit.

1337
01:26:53,413 --> 01:26:56,241
Stand up and be a man
for God's sake!

1338
01:26:56,310 --> 01:26:57,620
BARNES:
Grey, you fuckin' freak!

1339
01:26:57,655 --> 01:26:58,827
Pick up the fuckin' phone!

1340
01:26:58,862 --> 01:27:00,586
I got six calls on hold!

1341
01:27:00,655 --> 01:27:01,965
I can't wait for you anymore.

1342
01:27:02,034 --> 01:27:04,586
You're not taking him
to Disneyland.

1343
01:27:04,620 --> 01:27:05,275
BARNES:
No.

1344
01:27:05,310 --> 01:27:07,034
No, ma'am, I'm -- I'm sorry.

1345
01:27:07,068 --> 01:27:08,862
No.

1346
01:27:08,896 --> 01:27:10,241
Hold on.

1347
01:27:12,068 --> 01:27:14,068
This is who you are.

1348
01:27:14,068 --> 01:27:16,931
You can't even take care
of yourself!

1349
01:27:16,965 --> 01:27:20,620
I am sorry, but we are moving
and we're never coming back.

1350
01:27:20,689 --> 01:27:22,448
Grey!

1351
01:27:22,517 --> 01:27:23,862
God, fuck this!

1352
01:27:27,931 --> 01:27:31,724
Did you take the money, daddy?

1353
01:27:31,758 --> 01:27:34,862
We're not going to Disneyland,
are we?

1354
01:27:34,896 --> 01:27:36,068
James?

1355
01:27:36,068 --> 01:27:38,379
Dad.

1356
01:27:38,379 --> 01:27:39,620
Buddy.

1357
01:27:39,655 --> 01:27:41,896
It's too late, Grey.

1358
01:27:41,931 --> 01:27:44,448
He needs more than eggs, Grey.

1359
01:27:44,482 --> 01:27:46,862
You're breaking his heart.

1360
01:27:46,896 --> 01:27:48,724
I'm trying, honey.

1361
01:27:48,758 --> 01:27:49,965
No, you're not!

1362
01:27:50,034 --> 01:27:54,448
All I wanted was you
to be a man, and a father,

1363
01:27:54,482 --> 01:27:56,448
and to provide for his son!

1364
01:27:56,482 --> 01:27:57,827
Go to hell, Grey!

1365
01:27:57,896 --> 01:28:00,034
He deserves a better father
than you.

1366
01:28:00,068 --> 01:28:01,586
I can fix this.

1367
01:28:01,620 --> 01:28:02,793
I'm not an ogre!

1368
01:28:08,689 --> 01:28:09,862
Get out of the way, Barnes.

1369
01:28:09,896 --> 01:28:12,862
Dude, you need to stop
whatever the fuck you're doin'!

1370
01:28:15,103 --> 01:28:16,620
I mean it.

1371
01:28:21,689 --> 01:28:25,689
What the fuck, man,
just answer your phone, please.

1372
01:28:25,724 --> 01:28:27,000
Sorry for the hold,
we're a little short-staffed

1373
01:28:27,034 --> 01:28:28,689
at the moment, ma'am.

1374
01:28:33,137 --> 01:28:35,758
ERIC:

1375
01:28:41,137 --> 01:28:42,689
I need a raise today.

1376
01:28:42,758 --> 01:28:45,482
I'm taking my son to Disneyland.

1377
01:28:45,517 --> 01:28:47,137
Grey, I'm on the phone.

1378
01:28:47,137 --> 01:28:48,793
Hey, can I call you back again?

1379
01:28:48,827 --> 01:28:49,793
Yeah.

1380
01:28:49,793 --> 01:28:50,793
Alright.

1381
01:28:50,793 --> 01:28:51,862
Hey, thanks.

1382
01:28:54,793 --> 01:28:55,448
You know what?

1383
01:28:55,482 --> 01:28:56,827
Why don't you have a seat?

1384
01:28:56,862 --> 01:28:58,931
BARNES:
Hashtag gorgeous.

1385
01:28:58,965 --> 01:28:59,827
- Oh.
- JAMES: It's red.

1386
01:28:59,827 --> 01:29:00,517
- Looks like Shrek's--
- Yeah, it is.

1387
01:29:00,551 --> 01:29:01,413
JIM:
Looks like Shrek's dick.

1388
01:29:01,448 --> 01:29:03,448
BRODY:
Oh my God, he is so full, man.

1389
01:29:03,517 --> 01:29:04,827
- BARNES: My name's Zoey.
- JIM: Oh, oh.

1390
01:29:04,862 --> 01:29:06,586
I like coffee and suckin' dick.

1391
01:29:08,862 --> 01:29:10,827
BRODY:
Shouldn't it be green
if it's Shrek's dick?

1392
01:29:12,689 --> 01:29:14,000
What are you doing?

1393
01:29:14,034 --> 01:29:15,862
Oof, mind your own business,
Zoey.

1394
01:29:15,862 --> 01:29:17,034
This is Grey's!

1395
01:29:17,068 --> 01:29:18,206
Yeah, I know.

1396
01:29:18,206 --> 01:29:20,931
So it's his personal book
and you have no right to it!

1397
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,551
Aw, you seem to know
so much about it.

1398
01:29:23,551 --> 01:29:24,482
Get the fuck out of my way!

1399
01:29:24,517 --> 01:29:27,206
Oh, come on!

1400
01:29:27,206 --> 01:29:28,931
Just talk to me.

1401
01:29:28,965 --> 01:29:30,862
It's a children's book
he's writing with his son,

1402
01:29:30,896 --> 01:29:32,862
you fucking asshole!

1403
01:29:32,896 --> 01:29:34,103
You'd know.

1404
01:29:34,172 --> 01:29:35,586
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

1405
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:37,724
Come on, Zoey, just let it up.

1406
01:29:37,758 --> 01:29:39,206
- Everybody knows.
- Everybody knows what?

1407
01:29:39,241 --> 01:29:40,206
That we went to coffee?

1408
01:29:40,206 --> 01:29:41,758
So fucking what?

1409
01:29:41,827 --> 01:29:43,551
And that you've been fuckin'
him.

1410
01:29:43,586 --> 01:29:45,172
- Fuck you!
-

1411
01:29:45,206 --> 01:29:46,551
You already did that.

1412
01:29:46,586 --> 01:29:47,862
Come on, Zoey,
like why can't

1413
01:29:47,862 --> 01:29:49,551
you just give me
another chance?

1414
01:29:49,586 --> 01:29:52,034
- I need a raise today.
- Hmm.

1415
01:29:52,034 --> 01:29:54,068
So I can take my son
to Disneyland,

1416
01:29:54,103 --> 01:29:58,724
so I can be a better dad,
so my wife won't leave me.

1417
01:29:58,758 --> 01:30:00,034
I thought you were divorced.

1418
01:30:00,034 --> 01:30:02,655
What's your problem?

1419
01:30:02,689 --> 01:30:05,655
I do a good job.

1420
01:30:05,689 --> 01:30:08,034
I never call in sick.

1421
01:30:08,034 --> 01:30:08,931
I answer all my calls.

1422
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,206
Why can't you just pay me
what I'm worth?

1423
01:30:11,206 --> 01:30:12,965
So what if I fucking am?

1424
01:30:13,034 --> 01:30:15,862
Oh, you fuckin' suck his dick
on the first date, too, Zoe--

1425
01:30:17,068 --> 01:30:19,034
I was fucking drunk!

1426
01:30:19,068 --> 01:30:22,586
Oh, you really weren't
that drunk.

1427
01:30:22,655 --> 01:30:23,862
Just fuck you!

1428
01:30:23,896 --> 01:30:24,931
What's he got that
I don't have, huh?

1429
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,103
Fuck you!
Fuck you!

1430
01:30:26,172 --> 01:30:27,586
You already did that,
sweetheart.

1431
01:30:27,655 --> 01:30:29,172
I like him!

1432
01:30:29,206 --> 01:30:31,517
And he likes me
and that's all I want.

1433
01:30:31,517 --> 01:30:33,862
Oh, come back.

1434
01:30:33,862 --> 01:30:35,655
What's he have
that I don't have?

1435
01:30:35,689 --> 01:30:38,896
An ogre dick?

1436
01:30:38,896 --> 01:30:43,034
All that fucking matters to me
is to be a good father

1437
01:30:43,068 --> 01:30:45,862
and you won't let me do that.

1438
01:30:45,896 --> 01:30:48,620
Why don't you just pay me
what I'm worth?

1439
01:30:48,689 --> 01:30:51,586
I think you should clean out
your desk, Grey.

1440
01:30:51,620 --> 01:30:53,172
- We're done here.
- No, no.

1441
01:30:53,206 --> 01:30:54,896
- You give me a raise.
- We're done here.

1442
01:30:54,931 --> 01:30:58,000
You give me a raise, today.

1443
01:30:58,034 --> 01:30:59,827
Hey, you gotta get out there
right now.

1444
01:30:59,862 --> 01:31:01,655
Barnes is just flippin' out.

1445
01:31:01,724 --> 01:31:02,586
About what?

1446
01:31:02,655 --> 01:31:04,758
I don't know
but Zoey has Grey's book.

1447
01:31:10,931 --> 01:31:13,000
Tell me how to help you, please.

1448
01:31:13,068 --> 01:31:13,827
- Please.
-

1449
01:31:13,896 --> 01:31:15,103
He ruined it.

1450
01:31:15,103 --> 01:31:15,793
Just-- just tell me
what happened?

1451
01:31:15,827 --> 01:31:17,758
- He ruined it.
- It's okay.

1452
01:31:19,689 --> 01:31:20,655
Hey, take a deep breath, okay?

1453
01:31:22,137 --> 01:31:23,724
Come on now,
just take a deep breath.

1454
01:31:24,655 --> 01:31:26,103
Are you alright?

1455
01:31:37,241 --> 01:31:39,620
Can I have my book, please?

1456
01:31:39,655 --> 01:31:40,758
No, no.

1457
01:31:40,758 --> 01:31:42,655
No.

1458
01:31:42,724 --> 01:31:44,241
GREYSON:
Zoey.

1459
01:31:44,275 --> 01:31:46,448
I'm so sorry.

1460
01:31:47,965 --> 01:31:49,448
No.

1461
01:32:50,344 --> 01:32:52,689
Loser.

1462
01:32:56,827 --> 01:32:59,827
You're all alone.

1463
01:33:04,068 --> 01:33:05,103
No.

1464
01:33:09,206 --> 01:33:12,206
There is no Grey.

1465
01:33:16,034 --> 01:33:18,931
Do it.

1466
01:33:18,965 --> 01:33:21,137
Do it, Grey.

1467
01:33:28,862 --> 01:33:29,896
Why?

1468
01:33:33,275 --> 01:33:35,689
You ruined it!

1469
01:33:35,724 --> 01:33:37,068
You ruined everything.

1470
01:33:38,310 --> 01:33:40,724
I thought you were different
and you're just like them.

1471
01:33:40,758 --> 01:33:42,724
Grey, I didn't, please.

1472
01:33:42,758 --> 01:33:44,413
Don't, you're scaring me.

1473
01:33:44,448 --> 01:33:48,103
It was my one chance
and you ruined it.

1474
01:33:48,137 --> 01:33:49,862
And now I have nothing.

1475
01:33:49,896 --> 01:33:51,137
Grey, I'm sorry.

1476
01:33:51,206 --> 01:33:53,241
I didn't do it, I promise.

1477
01:33:53,275 --> 01:33:56,379
- Please, stop.
- And you.

1478
01:33:56,413 --> 01:33:59,896
Fuck you!

1479
01:33:59,931 --> 01:34:04,482
Why can't you just pay me
what I'm worth?

1480
01:34:04,517 --> 01:34:08,034
Why can't you just pay people
what they need to live?

1481
01:34:08,103 --> 01:34:09,448
Look at me.

1482
01:34:09,448 --> 01:34:12,034
Look at this.

1483
01:34:12,103 --> 01:34:14,137
I'm fuckin' dying here.

1484
01:34:14,172 --> 01:34:16,689
You made me break my promise
to my son.

1485
01:34:18,413 --> 01:34:19,965
There's no food.

1486
01:34:21,965 --> 01:34:23,862
He doesn't like eggs.

1487
01:34:25,275 --> 01:34:26,448
And it's your fault.

1488
01:34:29,310 --> 01:34:31,931
- Grey, please, don't--
- You're just like them.

1489
01:34:31,965 --> 01:34:33,206
Please-- please, no, stop it.

1490
01:34:33,275 --> 01:34:34,034
- You're just like all of them.
- Stop it, you're scaring me.

1491
01:34:34,103 --> 01:34:36,034
You're in on it
like all of them.

1492
01:34:36,103 --> 01:34:37,413
You're all in on it!

1493
01:34:37,448 --> 01:34:38,689
All of you!

1494
01:34:40,448 --> 01:34:41,310
Grey, please.

1495
01:34:41,310 --> 01:34:42,931
There's no food.

1496
01:34:42,965 --> 01:34:45,034
He doesn't like eggs.

1497
01:34:45,103 --> 01:34:46,344
He doesn't like--

1498
01:34:47,482 --> 01:34:50,344
He doesn't like eggs.

1499
01:34:50,379 --> 01:34:51,965
Do it.

1500
01:34:53,517 --> 01:34:55,413
Do it, Grey.

1501
01:34:59,137 --> 01:35:01,000
ERIC:
Kate.

1502
01:35:01,034 --> 01:35:02,793
- Kate!
- KATE: Yes.

1503
01:35:02,862 --> 01:35:03,931
ERIC:
Why don't you call the police,
huh?

1504
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,068
No, please!

1505
01:35:06,103 --> 01:35:07,758
He doesn't mean it,
he's not like that, please,

1506
01:35:07,827 --> 01:35:09,862
he just needs a chance, please.

1507
01:35:09,896 --> 01:35:10,862
Guys, get back to work.

1508
01:35:10,896 --> 01:35:12,517
- Please, don't.
- Zoey.

1509
01:35:12,517 --> 01:35:13,931
- Don't.
- Zoey.

1510
01:35:17,862 --> 01:35:19,862
- Come on, bitch.
- Leave him alone!

1511
01:35:22,862 --> 01:35:24,068
BRODY:
Run!

1512
01:35:26,896 --> 01:35:28,241
ZOEY:
Grey, no!
