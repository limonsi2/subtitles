<i>Welcome, it's Billie,</i>
<i>and this is</i> Happier Than Ever,

4
00:00:55,291 --> 00:01:00,500
<i>the first time I am doing my album</i>
<i>all in one, front to back.</i>

5
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:02,083
<i>So, enjoy.</i>

6
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,041
Welcome to the Hollywood Bowl.

7
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:55,125
It's me, Billie.

8
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm so excited for this,

9
00:07:57,083 --> 00:08:01,458
and I couldn't be happier to be here
with Gustavo Dudamel right behind me

10
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:02,750
and the LA Phil.

11
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:08,166
I wanna thank Romero Lubambo
right over there

12
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,833
for playing guitar for me.

13
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:12,125
This is a dream come true.

14
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:57,166
[Billie] As you could see,
there's a choir out here.

15
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,250
And this was actually
the choir that I grew up in,

16
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:05,291
and, um, a song that we used to do,
that, like, beginning and ending section,

17
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:07,375
that you just heard
in the song we just did.

18
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:11,583
I just fell in love with it then and knew
that I wanted to put it in a song.

19
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:14,250
And I thought it would be really cool
to have them

20
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:16,958
actually come out and sing it here.

21
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:19,583
It's just a cute little
full-circle moment.

22
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:21,750
So, thank you to the choir.

23
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,750
I love you guys, and--

24
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:26,833
So the next song we have is "Lost Cause."
[whispers] So, let's do it.

25
00:26:54,916 --> 00:26:57,083
<i>It is such a thrill</i>

26
00:26:57,166 --> 00:27:00,500
<i>to be able to do this in my hometown,</i>
<i>Los Angeles.</i>

27
00:27:01,916 --> 00:27:04,291
<i>A place that really formed me</i>
<i>into who I am,</i>

28
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:06,916
<i>and I think that I took it for granted.</i>

29
00:27:07,916 --> 00:27:09,041
<i>The older I've gotten,</i>

30
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:14,291
<i>the more I've come</i>
<i>to love Los Angeles so, so much</i>

31
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:19,708
<i>and be so grateful for my childhood</i>
<i>and my growth as a person.</i>

32
00:27:20,458 --> 00:27:22,250
<i>LA really got me there.</i>

33
00:47:16,666 --> 00:47:19,000
[man 1] Billie! Billie!

34
00:47:19,875 --> 00:47:22,250
-Yes! Billie!
-[clamoring]

35
00:47:24,416 --> 00:47:27,083
-[security] Guys, don't get too excited.
-[fan] Yeah!

36
00:47:27,166 --> 00:47:28,750
[woman 1] We love you, Billie!

37
00:47:32,125 --> 00:47:34,458
[woman 2]
Billie, we have a present for you!

38
00:58:42,541 --> 00:58:47,208
So here we are at our last song
of the whole night.

39
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:52,833
This has been a magical, beautiful,
um, amazing experience,

40
00:58:52,916 --> 00:58:56,583
and I can't, uh, really believe
that this happened at all.

41
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:57,791
This is the Hollywood Bowl,

42
00:58:57,875 --> 00:59:01,791
a place that has been the most
iconic venue in all of Los Angeles,

43
00:59:01,875 --> 00:59:04,208
and it's a real dream come true.

44
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:08,916
It's been so beautiful and so, uh, surreal
to do this tonight,

45
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,500
and yeah.

46
00:59:10,583 --> 00:59:13,625
We're gonna do "Male Fantasy,"
which is the last song on the album.

47
00:59:13,708 --> 00:59:18,083
Thank you guys for listening,
and thank you to everyone who's involved.

48
00:59:18,166 --> 00:59:21,083
I love you all to pieces,
and I will see you soon.
