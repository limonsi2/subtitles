(electronic whirring)

00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:08,800
- (groans) Yeah.
- We play and call it work!

(intense thudding)

8
00:00:16,265 --> 00:00:18,018
(leaves rustling)
- Ahoy!

9
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,728
Looky what we got here.

10
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:24,274
Headripper, cut his lights.

11
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:27,861
(leaves crunching)
(Drustan exhales loudly)

12
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,780
(leaves continue crunching)

00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,700
(dramatic instrumental music)

14
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,951
Oi!

15
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:37,370
Oh, I've seen this face before.

16
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,082
What do you think he's
thinking in his little brain?

17
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:43,251
- An orc with a brain bigger than a man's?

18
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:45,170
Quite the conundrum.

19
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,463
(Mograh yells)
(blow thudding)

20
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,506
- If I wanted to hear your talk,

21
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:50,300
I'd rip it out your face,

22
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,676
and smack against me sword!

23
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,888
Ain't that right, Headripper?

24
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,973
(Headripper growls)

25
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:59,142
Do you know why he's called Headripper?

26
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,935
(Headripper growls)
You see,

27
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:01,936
when people talk,

28
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,397
and he don't understand them gits,

29
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,191
he thinks rippin' their heads off

30
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:09,360
makes 'em easier to understand.

31
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,988
He ain't the sharpest tool.

32
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,573
Ain't that right, Headripper?

33
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,825
(Headripper growls)

34
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:18,036
- You talk lot for an orc.

35
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,371
(gasps) I suppose you have a brain?

36
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:21,206
(Mograh groans)
Is that what I

37
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,624
should call you then?

38
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,209
Brain, does it work?

39
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,253
(Drustan gasps)

40
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:31,800
- Clearly one as civilized as yourself

41
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,470
must have heard of Mograh the Merciless?

42
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,429
- Him,
(Headripper growls)

43
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,806
I've heard of.

44
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:40,140
You, I'm afraid not.

45
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,227
(Mograh yells)
(leaves rustling)

46
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,771
- Oi, do you fight in a den?

47
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,815
(armor clatters)
Stupid pea brain!

48
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,608
Must I do everything me self then?

49
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:49,567
(blow thuds)
(Headripper groans)

50
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,945
(intense dramatic music)
Lazy moppet!

51
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:55,073
You stay here and watch this dog.

52
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:55,907
(leaves crunching)

53
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,241

(blow thuds)
(Headripper growls)

58
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:05,542
Yes, Master, find the Bloodstone I will.

59
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:08,169
Search every village in
the Grimmock Mountain.

60
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,588
Oi, I'm no moppet.

61
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,632
(leaves crunching)

62
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,342
(Headripper growls)
(blow thuds)

63
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:16,094
(intense dramatic music)

64
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,971
(stuffed animal rustles)

65
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,556
(objects clattering)

66
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:20,890
(book thuds)

67
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:21,724
(pendant clanks)

68
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:22,976
(bag rustles)

69
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,396
(intense dramatic music)

70
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,817
(Mograh sighs)

71
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:31,901
(intense dramatic music continues)

72
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:32,735
Ranger.

73
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:34,779
(leaves rustling)

74
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:36,698
- [Drustan] 'Twas in
this moment, I realized,

75
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,951
the search for my daughter
may have come to an end.

76
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:43,163
Was all my waiting and tracking in vain?

77
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,082
I'd been bested by this vile creature.

78
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:50,170
Mograh may have been an orc,

79
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,798
but an exceptionally
clever orc he truly was.

80
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,425
Perhaps, by design?

81
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:58,970
A by-product of dark wizardry indeed.

82
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,471
If 'twas my end,

83
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,098
I knew in my heart,

84
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:05,059
in the afterlife, I
could tell my sweet Reina

85
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,521
I tried to avenge her.

86
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,608
(dark ominous music)

87
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,779
(suspenseful dramatic music)

88
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:38,676
(whimsical instrumental music)

89
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,138
(arrow shuffling)

90
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,640
(bow creaks)

91
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,394
(whimsical instrumental music continues)

92
00:03:58,696 --> 00:03:59,822
(bow creaks)

93
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,241
(arrow whooshing)

94
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:05,995
(whimsical instrumental music continues)

95
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,918
(blade tapping)

96
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,716
(intense whooshing)

97
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:22,178
(blade continues tapping)

98
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:26,266
(whimsical instrumental music continues)

99
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,601
(blade continues tapping)

100
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,479
(intense whooshing)

101
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:36,234
(whimsical instrumental music continues)

102
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:06,973
(blade continues tapping)

103
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:10,393
(intense dramatic tones)

104
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,063
- Daddy, don't leave!

105
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,231
- Reina, love, you know daddy must do

106
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,150
as the king orders, right?

107
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,484
And besides, who else will be the eyes

108
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,154
and ears of Lieutenant Brander Noke?

109
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:21,988
- He's hairy, though.

110
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,823
- Yes, indeed, he is.

111
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,199
Quite a hairy man, isn't he?

112
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,453
And you know who else will be there?

113
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,079
Flynt Tanner.

114
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,080
He'll have daddy's back.

115
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,123
- Big man.

116
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,709
- Indeed, he is.

117
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,712
And let's not forget Corser, daddy's mate.

118
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,630
I served with him since basic.

119
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,549
- I'll miss you, Daddy.

120
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:46,637
(dramatic instrumental music)
(whimsical tones)

121
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:49,307
(blade tapping)

122
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,310
(intense whooshing)

123
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,562
(blade continues tapping)

124
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:57,940
(intense dramatic music)

125
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,861
(footsteps pattering)

126
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:06,115
(intense dramatic music continues)

127
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:13,373
(somber dramatic music)

128
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,505
(leaves rustling)
- Oi, Headripper.

129
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,049
Feelin' like your king of the castle then?

130
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:07,427
Hackin' and sackin' defenseless pasties.

131
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,387
Oi!
(armor thuds)

132
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,221
(Headripper growls)

133
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,973
(armor clangs)

134
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,016
Feelin' sensitive, are we?
(Headripper growls)

135
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:17,353
That sack of skulls ain't doin' it for ya?

136
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:21,232
Oh, I ain't tryin' to steal your loot.

137
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,192
Or maybe I is.

138
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:26,028
(bag clatters)

139
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:29,991
Who was it who found them
pasties in the village?

140
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:30,867
Me!

141
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:34,370
Who was it that got himself
ambushed by rangers?

142
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,123
Oh, that's right!

143
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,207
You!

144
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,250
What's that, Master?

145
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,128
I'm the smartest orc you've ever seen?

146
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,714
Why, you're too kind, Master.

147
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,382
What's that?

148
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:49,010
You've got a message for Headripper?

149
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:49,886
Pea brain!

150
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:50,678
(Headripper growls)

151
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,638
Forget you're worthless trophy skulls,

152
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,557
and find the Bloodstone!

153
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:58,227
Oh, and do whatever
Mograh the Merciless says,

154
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:01,022
'cause he's smarter than you.

155
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:06,027
(sighs loudly) Time to tell
the Master we've got no slaves,

156
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,863
no trophies,
(skull thuds)

157
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,281
and no Bloodstone.

158
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:15,912
He will skewer us and feed
us to the fire breather.

159
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,748
(Headripper growls loudly)

160
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:19,790
(dramatic instrumental music)

161
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,627
- [Drustan] Everything reminds me of her,

162
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,587
the Jays singing,

163
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,589
tree branches dancing in the wind.

164
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,843
Orc raiding parties have
scoured my home village

165
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,595
in the Grimmock Mountains.

166
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,597
Alone on the outskirts of the Short Hills,

167
00:08:35,597 --> 00:08:37,433
I track the wretched green skins

168
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,186
responsible for killing my family.

169
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:44,232
My daughter's body never recovered.

170
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,067
Only a tear from her dress.

171
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:50,655
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

172
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:51,906
(pencil scratching)
My brother rangers

173
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,617
inform me these orcs are slavers.

174
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,620
I suspect Reina to be with them.

175
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:02,667
They had better pray not a
single scratch be on her!

176
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:03,584
(scroll rustles)

177
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:07,171
I hold a hawk-delivered-letter
from Lieutenant Wolf.

178
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:11,092
I fear his orders will be to
abandon my daughter's search

179
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,594
and fall back in the ranks.

180
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,680
Time is my greatest enemy now.

181
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,849
I hope orders align with my will.

182
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:24,188
- [Lieutenant Noke] Drustan,
I hope this letter reaches you

183
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:26,774
by the time you return to your village.

184
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:30,027
Our brothers in the north have
trapped the orcs responsible

185
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:32,530
for the destruction of your home.

186
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,533
You'll find them in the Short Hills.

187
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,244
Through their bravery and inquisition,

188
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,872
they discovered the true
motive behind their pillaging.

189
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,960
One, simply known as the Master,

190
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,463
has ordered them to find the Bloodstone.

191
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:52,300
At this point, little else is known.

192
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,136
For the rest of our brothers,

193
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,345
the time to seek out

194
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:59,140
and extinguish the orcs
who raided your village

195
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,100
has come to a halt.

196
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,769
We've just received
orders from Count Thriese

197
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:07,189
to eliminate trolls in
the The Bickerburg Hills

198
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,900
I understand if choose to stay behind

199
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,903
and pursue the orcs
who slewed your family.

200
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:16,115
We can fend off the trolls without you.

201
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:21,537
Revenge may seem a satisfying conquest.

202
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,372
Just remember, killing the orcs

203
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:28,377
won't replace the feelings
of loss that pain your soul,

204
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:32,340
but will serve as a good
distraction in the interim.

205
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,676
Be wary of the one they call Mograh.

206
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:40,139
He and his companion take
orders directly from the Master,

207
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:44,226
not infamous for enslaving
and toying with prisoners.

208
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:49,065
May your loved ones reach
the heavens in peace.

209
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,025
Lieutenant Brander Noke.

210
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:54,445
(ominous dramatic music)

211
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,865
(apple thuds)

212
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:00,993
(leaves crunching)

213
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:04,413
(intense dramatic music)

214
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,381
(bear rustles)
(leaves crunching)

215
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,548
(taps bag)

216
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,092
(footsteps pattering)

217
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:19,845
(suspenseful dramatic music)

218
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,733
- [Drustan] A dispute amongst them.

219
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,318
(armor clangs)

220
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,945
(feet clomping)

221
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,988
There's only two sets of tracks,

222
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:38,906
not a third.

223
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,784
Perhaps, the large one
decided to carry Reina.

224
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,328
(leaves rustling)

225
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:47,498
(eerie ominous music)

226
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,004
No.

227
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,844
(intense whooshing)

228
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,471
(Drustan groans angrily)

229
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:03,305
No!

230
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:09,145
(footsteps pattering)

231
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:12,565
(intense dramatic music)

232
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,067
Die creature!

233
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,026
(bow creaking)

234
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:18,028
(Headripper groans)

235
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,572
(blade clanks)

236
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,323
Your soul is deep.

237
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,283
(bow creaks)

238
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,117
(arrow whooshing)

239
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,201
By order of the King,

240
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,786
(Mograh thuds)

241
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,413
you will die for your sins!

242
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,248
(arrow whooshing)

243
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,625
(arrow clanks)

244
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,002
(leaves rustling)

245
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:37,256
(intense dramatic music continues)

246
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,972
(Drustan screams)

247
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,766
(armor clanks)

248
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,142
- Oh, fresh meat.

249
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,810
(Headripper growls)

250
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,146
Oh, invitin' him for
afternoon tea sounds better?

251
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:52,980
(Headripper growls)

252
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,939
Of course, we kill him!

253
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,149
You stupid git.

254
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,901
(Headripper growls)

255
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,445
But first, we slave him.

256
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,238
(Headripper growls loudly)

257
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:02,865
It's settled then.

258
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:06,368
(Headripper growls)

259
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:10,247
(ominous dramatic music)

260
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:13,167
(leaves crunching)

261
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:19,048
(ominous dramatic music continues)

262
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:39,401
- [Drustan] Two arrows
'tis all it would take.

263
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,114
(leaves crunching)

264
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:48,035
(ominous dramatic music continues)

265
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,161
- I think that pasties
is in the woods with us.

266
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,748
You heard him squeal a klick back.

267
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:55,876
- [Drustan] Those heinous
creatures deserve to die.

268
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,629
(Headripper growls)

269
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:01,841
- I say we find him, slave him,

270
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,510
and bring him back to the boss man.

271
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,346
(Headripper growls)

272
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,265
- [Drustan] I could end it now.

273
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,975
I could avenge Reina.

274
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,561
- Bring him back to the boss' lair

275
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,522
after we squeeze him for the Bloodstone.

276
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,233
- [Drustan] But knowing
where the Master is

277
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,568
could be paramount.

278
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,902
(Headripper growls)

279
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,779
- Oh, you've got a better plan, then?

280
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:24,864
- Decide!
(arrow screeches)

281
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,283
- I don't think he's got it, stupid!

282
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,285
But he might know where it is!

283
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,119
- [Drustan] Avenge your daughter,

284
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,289
or possibly save many lives?

285
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,832
(Headripper growls)

286
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:35,790
- Oh, shut it, you!

287
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,503
(exhales loudly)

288
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:42,172
(pants heavily)

289
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,635
(pendant clanks)

290
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:49,638
(dramatic instrumental music)

291
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:50,472
(leaves crunching)
(arrows clatter)

292
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:52,349
(ominous dramatic music)

293
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,225
- [Drustan] Please don't hurt me.

294
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,184
- Ahoy!

295
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:55,978
Looky what we got here.

296
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,939
(bow clatters)

297
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:01,442
Headripper, cut his lights.

298
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,735
(leaves crunching)
(dark ominous music)

299
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,279
(blow thuds)
(Drustan groans)

300
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,865
Oi, I've seen this face before.

301
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,285
(Mograh yells)
(Drustan thuds)

302
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,244
All right,
(armor clatters)

303
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,621
you find it then.

304
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,455
(armor clatters)

305
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,372
Stupid pea brain!

306
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,416
Must I do everything me self then?

307
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,376
(armor clatters)
(Headripper grunts)

308
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:20,836
Lazy moppet.

309
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:23,839
You stay here and watch this dog.

310
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:24,673
(leaves crunching)

311
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:25,507
(blow thuds)
(Drustan groans painfully)

312
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,217
(body thuds)

313
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,469
(bag clatters)

314
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,471
(leaves crunching)

315
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,805
(blow thuds)
(Headripper growls)

316
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:32,806
(intense dramatic music)

317
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,892
(leaves crunching)

318
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,102
(Headripper growls)
(blow thuds)

319
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,772
- (groans loudly) I'd be angry as well

320
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,607
if I were treated like you.

321
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,441
But surely, you must realize

322
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,694
you're more powerful than
Mograh the Messiness?

323
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:46,570
(Headripper growls)
And I know

324
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,738
you're smarter than he.

325
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,700
Your reputation precedes your greatness.

326
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,868
(bag clatters)

327
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:53,702
(pendant clanks)

328
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,204
(bag clatters)

329
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:58,040
(leaves rustling)

330
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,001
(Mograh sighs loudly)

331
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,753
(leaves crunching)

332
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,254
- Ranger.

333
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,048
(leaves crunching)
No.

334
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:10,552
- Mograh is only merciless
because of you, Headripper.

335
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:16,266
- Oh, think you're pretty
clever then, Ranger?

336
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:19,353
Headripper, this one's an orc hunter.

337
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:23,190
Hold him still, so I cam pluck
him right between the eyes

338
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,235
with his own arrow.
(arrow scratching)

339
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,695
Well, what you waitin' for?

340
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:28,529
Move!

341
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,613
You lazy moppet!

342
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:32,199
(Headripper growls loudly)

343
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,325
(bow thuds)

344
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:37,913
(gasping) Headripper, I'm sorry.

345
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:38,789
Don't.

346
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,165
(Mograh speaks indistinctly)
(leaves rustling)

347
00:16:41,165 --> 00:16:42,543
(arrow clatters)
(Mograh gasps)

348
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,169
(body thuds)

349
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,879
(arrow scratching)

350
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:46,714
(Headripper grunts)

351
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:47,715
Stop what?

352
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,216
Calling you stupid?

353
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,468
But you are stupid, you mindless bog!

354
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,053
(Headripper growls)

355
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,930
(arrow scratching)

356
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,141
Oi, I'm not your enemy.

357
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,851
(Headripper growls)

358
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,227
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

359
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,813
I know where we can
get more trophy skulls,

360
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,356
more than you can count!

361
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,569
Well, maybe more than that.

362
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,529
(Headripper growls loudly)

363
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:13,281
Lets keep this pasties
for ourselves, yeah?

364
00:17:13,281 --> 00:17:15,200
Forget about the Master.
(leaves rustling)

365
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,492
Oh, come on, boy!

366
00:17:16,492 --> 00:17:19,246
Don't you remember all
the good kills we had?

367
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,372
(bow creaking)

368
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,040
Oi, the pasties free!

369
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:24,792
- For my daughter!

370
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:26,502
(armor clangs)
(Headripper growls)

371
00:17:26,502 --> 00:17:27,337
(Drustan grunts)

372
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:28,172
(footsteps pattering)

373
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,006
(Drustan yells)

374
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:29,965
(feet shuffling)
- Watch it.

375
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,050
Watch it now.

376
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:31,884
(Drustan grunts)
(armor clangs)

377
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:32,843
(armor thuds)

378
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,511
You're dead now pastie.

379
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:35,345
(bow whooshing)

380
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:36,180
(leaves crunching)
(feet shuffling)

381
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,806
- You scum!

382
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:40,768
Your lower than the dirt,
killing an innocent child!

383
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:43,187
(leaves rustling)

384
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,855
(Headripper grunts)

385
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:45,981
- She was yar.

386
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,608
(Headripper growls)
(leaves rustling)

387
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:48,442
(armor thuds)

388
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,861
(blows thudding)
Pretty little thing she was.

389
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:53,363
(leaves rustling)

390
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:54,406
(Drustan grunts)

391
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,241
The thing about little girls is,

392
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,826
(Drustan groans)
(armor thuds)

393
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,620
they make a perfect supper

394
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,579
(armor thuds)
(leaves rustling)

395
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:01,622
(Drustan wincing painfully)

396
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,499
right before a good killin'.

397
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,583
(leaves rustling)

398
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,001
(Drustan grunts)
(armor thuds)

399

(blow thuds)
(Headripper grunts)

404
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:12,925
(leaves rustling)

405
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,218
(blade clanks)
(Headripper groans)

406
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,261
(intense dramatic music)

407
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,429
(Drustan exhales loudly)

408
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,263
Go!

409
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,139
(Headripper growls)

410
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,390
(Drustan grunts)
(air whooshing)

411
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,017
(blade whooshing)
- Come on.

412
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:22,851
(Drustan grunts)

413
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,186
(Headripper growls)
(blade clanks)

414
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,021
(Headripper continues growling)

415
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,273
- Slice his limbs off!

416
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,733
(blade whooshing)

417
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:30,567
(blade continues whooshing)
(feet shuffling)

418
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:34,071
Surrender, and we'll
only chop you into bits.

419
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,365
- You creatures will
have your just reward!

420
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,282
- Enough!

421
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,117
(Headripper growls)

422
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:38,951
(blade thuds)

423
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:39,868

(head thuds)

429
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,964
(continues groaning)
(intense dramatic tones)

430
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,215
(Drustan grunts and groans)

431
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,968
(gagging loudly)

432
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,138
Oi, Headripper,

433
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,849
should be tell this git

434
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,351
his little, pastie girl is still alive?

435
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,394
(intense dramatic tones)
(breathes heavily)

436
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,354
Oh, that's right,

437
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,481
we didn't gut her like you think.

438
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,942
We sold her to them Outlanders.

439
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:15,737
(chuckles) Your vengeance is in vain.

440
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:18,198
(Drustan groans angrily)

441
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,492
(Headripper thuds)

442
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,119
(Drustan groans)
(blow thuds)

443
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,120
(sword unsheathes)

444
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,037
(Drustan yells)

445
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:24,872
(blade clangs)

446
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:28,333
(upbeat triumphant music)

447
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,752
(Drustan breathes heavily)

448
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,588
(blade clanks)

449
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:33,714
(Mograh thuds)

450
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,340
You will never find her.

451
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,594
The Master will use her
for his dark purpose.

452
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,806
She will be lost forever.

453
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,391
You will-
(blade clangs)

454
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:48,979
(Mograh gasps)
(leaves crunching)

455
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,230
(blade clanks)

456
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,315
(Drustan exhales loudly)

457
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:54,401
- I will find her, creature.

458
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:58,530
And when I do, she will be as pure

459
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,950
and unscathed as the day she was born.

460
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:06,121
Reina, wherever you are,

461
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:09,541
daddy's coming for you.

462
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,420
Don't lose hope, child.

463
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,340
(insects chirping)

464
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:22,346
(eerie ominous music)

465
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:25,098
(snow pattering)

466
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,480
(leaves crunching)

467
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,315
(bow clatters)

468
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:36,318
(arrows clattering)

469
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,987
(cloak rustles)

470
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,743
(bag thuds)

471
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:48,121
(belt rattles)

472
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:50,666
(coat rustles)

473
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:53,835
(coat thuds)

474
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:56,129
(cloak rustles)

475
00:20:56,129 --> 00:21:00,050
(whimsical instrumental music)

476
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,517
(intense dramatic music)

477
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,351
(paper softly crinkles)

478
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:14,147
(intense dramatic music continues)

479
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:15,190
(cloak rustles)

480
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:19,444
(intense dramatic music continues)

481
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:25,200
(bag gently rustles)

482
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,413
(intense dramatic music continues)

483
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,544
(Drustan groans)

484
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,343
(bag gently rustles)

485
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:46,346
(coin purse clangs)

486
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:52,686
(intense dramatic music continues)

487
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,398
(bag gently rustles)

488
00:21:56,398 --> 00:22:00,152
(suspenseful dramatic music)

489
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,241
(bag rustles)

490
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,909
(branch crunching)

491
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,328
(dagger clanks)
(Traveler yells)

492
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,038
You dare steal from a Ranger!

493
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,581
- I wasn't stealing!

494
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,249
- I'm a protector of the Borderlands.

495
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,793
I save vagrants like you.

496
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:18,295
- I just want food.

497
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,422
- So you can live to steal another day?

498
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:23,675
- No Ranger, I am hungry, nothing more.

499
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,136
- You from these parts?

500
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:27,929
- Mostly.

501
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:30,932
- Then point me to the Outlanders.

502
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:34,728
- Head west from here.

503
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,646
The forest is crawling with them.

504
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:37,564
- And their camp?

505
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,192
- You'll never find them.

506
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,027
No one has.

507
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:45,072
- I'm not your average tracker, Vagrant.

508
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,823
(leaves crunching)

509
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,033
- I'm not a vagrant.

510
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,911
(bag rustles)
More of a wandering traveler.

511
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,746
(Traveler grunts)
(apple thuds)

512
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:53,830
(arrows clatter)
(leaves crunching)

513
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,290
Much gratitude, Ranger.

514
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,251
What will you do when you find them?

515
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:00,253
(coat thuds)
- Take it, it's yours.

516
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,923
(cloak rustles)

517
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,843
(leaves crunching)

518
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:09,262
- This man has a death wish.
(eerie suspenseful tones)

519
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:14,267
(dramatic instrumental music)
(water lapping)

520
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:22,192
- My brother, why such a betrayal?

521
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,111
You were unmatched as our leader.

522
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,904
Could you not let the spoils of war

523
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,365
satisfy your need for retribution?

524
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,784
But instead, you became weak.

525
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,871
You chose a natural born enemy
as your companion in life.

526
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,124
Why, Brother?

527
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,210
- You got greedy, Henrik.

528
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,796
We are protectors of the realm,

529
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,965
not thieves, nor bandits.

530
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:49,761
You (spits) shame us.

531
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,179
- [Henrik] And who shall provide for us,

532
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:53,014
if not ourselves?

533
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:56,560
The King's hand has never
cared for us, nor executed law.

534
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,395
We are the law, Bjorn!

535
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,063
We dictate how we survive!

536
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:00,897
- And the orcs,

537
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:03,692
trading with green skins?

538
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:05,902
Tell me, Brother,

539
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:11,741
how is it just to have
captives mend your clothes

540
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:13,410
and cook your meat?

541
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,870
(Henrik groans)
(blow thuds)

542
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,038
- This could have been yours, Brother.

543
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:17,873
We need you.

544
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:22,127
Lead us to the spoils and
riches you once promised.

545
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,296
(suspenseful dramatic music)

546
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,214
- You're right, Henrik.

547
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:27,466
I did promise you riches.

548
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,385
(Bjorn pants heavily)

549
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:31,970
But that was before

550
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,723
you were tainted by
the forces of darkness!

551
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,100
(headbutt thuds)
(Henrik groans painfully)

552
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,143
(Bjorn grunts)
(blow thuds)

553
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,729
(feet shuffling)

554
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,022
(Outlander grunts)
(blow thuds)

555
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,231
(hay rustles)

556
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:47,819
(suspenseful dramatic music continues)

557
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:05,003
(arrows rattling)
(footsteps pattering)

558
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:09,591
(suspenseful dramatic music continues)

559
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:19,601
(arrows rattling)
(footsteps pattering)

560
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:20,977
(hands thud)
- What?

561
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,771
(armor clanks)

562
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:23,897
(muffled groaning)
(body thuds)

563
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,440
(Drustan grunts)

564
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,192
(bow thuds)
(Outlander groaning)

565
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,860
(feet shuffling)

566
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,947
(swords unsheathing)

567
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,077
(sword whooshing)
(metal clangs)

568
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,745
(suspenseful dramatic music)

569
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,664
(leaves crunching)

570
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:41,665
(pats armor)

571
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:45,544
(suspenseful dramatic music continues)

572
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:46,836
(sword clanks)

573
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:48,421
(footsteps pattering)

574
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:50,131
(Drustan groans)
(blow thuds)

575
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:50,966
(Outlander yells out painfully)

576
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:51,800
(leaves crunching)

577
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,385
(stick thuds)
(Drustan groans)

578
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,886
(Outlander grunts angrily)

579
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:55,720
- Come on!
- No!

580
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,555
(foot thuds)
(Outlander groans)

581
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:57,639
(leaves rustling)

582
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,307
(Outlander yells)
(chains rattling)

583
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:02,686
(Outlander grunts)
(body thuds)

584
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:03,520
(dagger unsheathing)

585
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,022
(air whooshing)
(sword clanking)

586
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,482
(body thuds)

587
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:08,441
(leaves rustling)

588
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:12,445
(triumphant instrumental music)

589
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,291
- I swear to you,

590
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,709
I will let you live,

591
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:27,877
just tell me,

592
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:30,171
(triumphant instrumental music continues)

593
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:33,633
(leaves gently rustling)
where's my daughter?

594
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,927
- [Outlander] I'll die before I tell you!

595
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:39,347
(Drustan grunts)
(Outlander groans)

596
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:41,391
(triumphant instrumental music continues)

597
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,392
(sword clanks)

598
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:47,230
(triumphant instrumental music continues)

599
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,571
(whimsical tones)

600
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,448
- [Drustan] The time is running out.

601
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,907
I've been searching for Reina

602
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:00,994
out here in the Borderlands far too long.

603
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,038
I've lost track of the weeks.

604
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,372
I feel I'm close,

605
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:08,209
but all progress seems to
be halted by Outlanders,

606
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:09,294
who would rather meet death

607
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:12,922
than give up their base of operations.

608
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:16,384
It's as if they're protected
by a dark shroud of evil.

609
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:21,389
Mograh the Merciless, the
vial, wretched orc scum,

610
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:26,895
sold her to the Outlanders
right before I killed him.

611
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,938
She is but a child.

612
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:31,066
A sweet innocent.

613
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:34,694
A gift from the heavens
from a supreme creator.

614
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:36,655
And I still have no more clues

615
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,282
regarding this precious Bloodstone.

616
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:42,369
I'd sacrifice my beating heart for it

617
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,871
if it meant the life of my sweet Reina.

618
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:50,043
I am a powerless nothing.
(pencil scratching)

619
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:53,129
(dark ominous music)

620
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:04,349
(Caraphinneth chants
in a mystical language)

621
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:10,522
(grass rustling)
(eerie ominous tones)

622
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:16,945
(Caraphinneth continues
chanting in a mystical language)

623
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:27,789
(dark ominous music swells)

624
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:32,752
(leaves crunching)

625
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:35,797
(bones cracking)
(Mograh groans)

626
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:39,092
- [Mograh] (sighs) Oh, I
see the leaves are back.

627
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:40,635
(spits loudly)

628
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:42,095
'Bout time you showed up.

629
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:45,223
- Mograh, we have Bloodstone to find.

630
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,934
- You mean to tell me,
after all this time,

631
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:50,770
we still haven't found
this cursed Bloodstone?

632
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:55,275
My ever reliable elven
necromancer, Caraphinneth,

633
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,485
I though you were resourceful?

634
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:59,863
- Nei, I do as the Master orders.

635
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,448
- (sighs) He's a moppet.

636
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:04,743
(whimsical tones)
(ominous dramatic music)

637
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,912
(footsteps pattering)

638
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:16,755
(bow creaking)

639
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:17,881
- I hear you creature.

640
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,508
Present yourself.

641
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:22,469
Don't toy with me, creature.

642
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:25,013
I can pick up your scent a mile away.

643
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,765
State your purpose in following me,

644
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,099
and mind your words,

645
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,517
or they may just be your last.

646
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:31,519
- I am Sharia Gethyra.

647
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,897
I am not your enemy.

648
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:35,315
I've been following your
death trail of Outlanders

649
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,901
for the last 13-
- 13 1/2 miles.

650
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,319
Yes, I know.

651
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,195
Why?

652
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,363
- I come to seek out the
Watcher of the Woods.

653
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:43,907
- I'm afraid you have the wrong man.

654
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,992
- There is about one
ranger in these parts,

655
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,869
and that ranger is you.

656
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,662
You can track these Outlanders,

657
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:51,414
but you cannot defeat them alone.

658
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:53,583
I know you're searching
for someone you've lost.

659
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:54,959
You're a soldier,

660
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,337
trained is his tactical advantage.

661
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,880
I'm offering aid.

662
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,840
Be wise and take it, human.

663
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,217
- Outlanders taking captives

664
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,260
is common knowledge in these parts.

665
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,429
Clearly, I'm in search of someone.

666
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:08,139
And Watcher of the Woods?

667
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,350
One look at my crest
tells you I'm a ranger.

668
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,519
Your description of me as a soldier

669
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:16,147
is as generic as driftwood
floating down the Cassian River.

670
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,399
- No, Ranger, I do know you.

671
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,318
You're a protector of the realm.

672
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,653
- As are all rangers.

673
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,238
Now, be on your way, creature!

674
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,614
Do not follow me!

675
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:25,740
- Think this through.

676
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,450
They have her.

677
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,035
They have your daughter.

678
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:32,956
(ominous dramatic music)

679
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,707
- [Drustan] I beg your pardon?

680
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:37,293
- You've been tracking these
Outlanders for weeks now.

681
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,170
I know exactly where they are.

682
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,631
Join me, and together we can defeat them.

683
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:44,259
- How dare you use my daughter

684
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,427
in attempts to sway my purpose!

685
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:49,264
I don't know you from a stone in my shoe.

686
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:53,518
I do not wish to sleep with
one eye and one ear open!

687
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,728
Stop your pursuit!

688
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:56,980
You'd only slow me down.

689
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,190
I do not care for your aid!

690
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,276
Do not follow me, creature!

691
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,319
- Stop calling me creature!

692
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:06,072
You will learn to appreciate
my generosity, human!

693
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:10,535
(ominous dramatic music)
(grass rustling)

694
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,828
(Sharia exhales loudly)
(rock rustles)

695
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,454
- Have it your way, She-elf.

696
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:16,958
(dramatic instrumental music)
(bow whooshing)

697
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:19,752
(Sharia groans)
(blows thudding)

698
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:21,838
(blows continue thudding)

699
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,590
(Drustan grunting)

700
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,092
(blows continue thudding)

701
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:27,010
(Drustan groans)

702
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:27,844
(blows thudding)
(Sharia grunts)

703
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,804
(blows continue thudding)
(Drustan grunting)

704
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,014
(Sharia yells)
(arrows clattering)

705
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,390
(blows thudding)

706
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,893
(Drustan grunts)
(air whooshing)

707
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,520
(arrows clattering)
(blows thudding)

708
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,397
(Drustan grunts)
(Sharia thuds)

709
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,565
(sighs loudly)

710
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:41,399
(air whooshing)
(arrows clattering)

711
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,610
(Drustan grunts)
(blows thudding)

712
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:47,447
(dramatic instrumental music)

713
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:52,201
- Remove your head from the
sand, Ranger, and join me.

714
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,162
- I've misjudged you, Elf.

715
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,830
Your skills are, indeed, expert,

716
00:31:56,831 --> 00:32:00,585
but my resolve to find my
daughter alone is firm.

717
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:05,715
Seek the Watcher of the Woods no longer.

718
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,842
You will only find solitude in your quest.

719
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,263
(cloak rustling)

720
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:15,433
(footsteps pattering)

721
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,476
(cloak rustles)

722
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:19,145
(air whooshing)

723
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:23,900
(pensive instrumental music)

724
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:46,047
(water gently lapping)
(footsteps pattering)

725
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:50,635
(pensive instrumental music continues)

726
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,474
- [Crickitus] We've
got the child, She-elf.

727
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,267
It's the Outlander way!

728
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:00,520
(dramatic instrumental music)

729
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,604
(Crickitus groans)

730
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:03,231
(gear clattering)

731
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,399
(footsteps pattering)
(Crickitus groans)

732
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,233
(Sharia grunts)
(hand thuds)

733
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,067
- Wait!

734
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:06,901
He can tell us more!

735
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,569
- Kindly remove your hand, Ranger!

736
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,446
(Crickitus groans)
(leaves crunching)

737
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:11,531
(Crickitus grunts)
(sword clangs)

738
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,241
(sword unsheathing)
(Sharia yells)

739
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:14,242
(Crickitus continues groaning)
(elbow thuds)

740
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,076
(feet shuffling)
(Sharia grunts)

741
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,077
(Drustan groans)
(sword clanks)

742
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:16,953
(Crickitus yells)
(Drustan thuds)

743
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:17,954
(footsteps pattering)
- Stop!

744
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:18,788
(Sharia groans)

745
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:19,622
(Crickitus yells)
(ax whooshing)

746
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:20,873
(foot thuds)
Get him!

747
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:22,458
(Sharia groans)

748
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:23,292
No!
(blade clanking)

749
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:27,547
(skin squelching)
(blade clanks)

750
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:28,381
(Crickitus groans)

751
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,425
Where is my daughter?

752
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,427
May your final act be noble

753
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,762
from one warrior to another.

754
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:37,640
Please tell me where she is.

755
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,934
- The She-elf already knows.

756
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:43,813
(head thuds)

757
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:48,818
(cloak rustles)
(Drustan sighs)

758
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:51,446
(sword sheathes)

759
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:54,115
(cloak rustles)

760
00:33:57,118 --> 00:34:00,246
- All right, Sharia Gethyra.

761
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,791
Take me to her then.

762
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,670
- [Sharia] Why the sudden
change of heart, Ranger?

763
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,549
- This man's blood has
verified your words,

764
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,386
and I always trust blood over woods.

765
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,306
Lead the way.

766
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:24,270
(leaves crunching)

767
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:27,356
(dark ominous music)

768
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:43,164
(Caraphinneth chants
in a mystical language)

769
00:34:44,998 --> 00:34:46,918
- Mograh, give your blade.

770
00:34:48,335 --> 00:34:49,545
(dagger unsheathes)

771
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:50,838
- If I had a gold coin

772
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:53,341
for every time you stopped
to chant your grog.

773
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,092
- It is not grog, Mograh.

774
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:58,679
I prepare hideous poison
that stay in body,

775
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,972
even after death.

776
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:02,642
- [Mograh] And all this
time I thought I was evil.

777
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,894
- [Caraphinneth] Once
poison enters bloodstream,

778
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:07,939
Vital organs begin to consume each other.

779
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,524
Bones consume flesh,

780
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,275
sinews consume bone,

781
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,777
until there is nothing left

782
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,071
but blackness underneath the skin.

783
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,989
- Oi, give it here, Elf!

784
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,491
Or I'll cut you like a porker!

785
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:23,496
(Caraphinneth chants
in a mystical language)

786
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:28,334
- This poison is made from
the blood of 13 black orcs.

787
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:30,711
The essence of evil contained therein

788
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:34,048
is more powerful than the
resurrected life force

789
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:36,717
that flows through your veins.

790
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:38,928
Don't toy with it, Mograh.

791
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:41,389
I'm trying to protect you from awful fate.

792
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:44,058
- Caraphinneth, I'm sorry.

793
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,476
(Mograh gasping)

794
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:48,062
(breathes heavily)

795
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,939
You wicked witch!

796
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:53,109
(dark ominous music swells)

797
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,194
- [Drustan] Had I lost my way,

798
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:59,740
never did I dream not considered
traveling with a She-elf.

799
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,075
To associate with one

800
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:04,203
is to bring unwelcome
judgment from the kingdom.

801
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,997
Seemed we were desperate allies.

802
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:10,168
At this point, I held on
to any glimmer of hope

803
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,794
I would find Reina,

804
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:13,254
even if it meant remaining

805
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,798
in the company of this woodland creature.

806
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:19,760
Her proud superiority
over humans was unnerving.

807
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,430
As a child, I thought that
wood elves to be a theory,

808
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,890
and without guile.

809
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,725
Years of rangering in the Borderlands

810
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,435
have taught me otherwise.

811
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,520
They're hundreds of years old.

812
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,772
Proud beings, they are,

813
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:33,316
and rightfully so.

814
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:36,152
I suppose, after centuries
of living and fighting,

815
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:38,487
I'd be a proud creature as well.

816
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:41,699
I would travel with the
She-elf as long as needed,

817
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:44,619
then we would go our separate ways.

818
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,537
(footsteps pattering)

819
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,206
- Drop your gear, Ranger.

820
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,208
We'll rest here and gather our strength.

821
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,796
- Well, you certainly travel light.

822
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:57,340
- [Sharia] Well, I don't
require as much as you do

823
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,550
to sustain myself.

824
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,052
(arrows clatter)

825
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,638
- You wood elves have always
been peculiar creatures.

826
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,973
- Well, you humans have always been quick

827
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:08,768
to wage war on that which
you do not understand.

828
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:13,814
Do you have a name, Ranger,

829
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:17,151
or shall I just call you Ranger
for the rest of our journey?

830
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:20,780
- Why is it of concern?

831
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:30,414
If you must know, I am Drustan Lorne.

832
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:33,709
- Quite the name for a
farmer turned ranger.

833
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:35,253
- You have it wrong, She-elf.

834
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,296
I was not a farmer,

835
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:42,760
nor was I anything really.

836
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,472
Just lost in the dark shroud

837
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:48,474
that consumes most things in this world.

838
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,729
- [Sharia] So where
does your journey begin?

839
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:57,066
(mellow instrumental music)

840
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,526
- [Drustan] Life wasn't always as dark

841
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,152
and grim as I've come to know it.

842
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,780
Before the orc raiding wars

843
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:06,075
there was peace in the Grimmock Mountains.

844
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:11,998
The King's vanguard, his
elite warriors, the rangers,

845
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:15,084
stood immovable and
steadfast in their duty

846
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:17,420
to protect the Borderlands.

847
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,381
My Indian mother died

848
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:23,092
by the hand festering
creatures of darkness.

849
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:27,388
Hence my ever-growing hatred towards them.

850
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,557
My father, the trapper,

851
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,684
often spoke of his ancient ancestors

852
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,769
who were protectors of the realm.

853
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:37,023
They were legendary in
the art of the hunt.

854
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:39,942
The old man would go on and on.

855
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:41,652
Before one day,

856
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:45,489
a thieving bandit stabbed
him for 13 pieces of silver.

857
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:50,286
And so I became a child of the village.

858
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:53,789
In this place was a certain
unspeakable serenity

859
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,958
that permeated the very essence of life.

860
00:38:58,836 --> 00:38:59,920
I knew everyone,

861
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:04,759
and in turn, everyone knew me.

862
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:08,012
We all had a similar story to tell.

863
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:11,432
I considered these fine people my family.

864
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:14,101
I grew quite fond of them.

865
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,687
We took care of one another.

866
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,690
(indistinct chattering)
- Great times

867
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,525
with a wonderful-
(child groans)

868
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,652
(fruit thuds)
(villager groans)

869
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:24,987
If that's not bad enough for you,

870
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:26,530
I'm gonna get you!

871
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,491
(child yells)

872
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,408
(villager groans)

873
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:31,243
- [Drustan] Deep down in my heart,

874
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:34,205
I always knew one day

875
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:38,209
the peaceful life I enjoyed
would be taken away.

876
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,961
Call it a stirring in my dreams.

877
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:43,672
The voice of destiny was calling to me,

878
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:47,843
echoing through the
ages, transcending time,

879
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:50,388
compelling me to heed her call.

880
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:55,434
Alas, it was time to meet my future.

881
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,937
A village steeped in tradition

882
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,980
held true to a rite of passage,

883
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,526
When one came to the age of independence,

884
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:06,654
one would see the Lady of the Woods.

885
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:10,658
And so I gathered every
needful thing for my journey.

886
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:14,662
I knew not what it truly
meant to survive in the woods.

887
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:15,663
I was a young man

888
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:19,125
with a naive notion that
all was well in the world.

889
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:23,129
Nevertheless, my eyes would soon be opened

890
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:27,007
to the raw reality that plagued mankind.

891
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:31,512
(mellow instrumental music continues)

892
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:36,809
(gentle orchestral music)

893
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:53,033
(dramatic instrumental music)

894
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:08,924
(dark ominous music)

895
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:17,266
(leaves rustling)

896
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:23,105
(dark ominous music continues)

897
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:27,526
- Give your hand.

898
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:32,990
(dark ominous music continues)

899
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,241
- [Drustan] What do you see?

900
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:35,242
- No, no (shushing).

901
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:37,661
You no talk.

902
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,163
You listen now.

903
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:44,376
I see two ways for you.

904
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:48,047
The first path is quiet, peaceful.

905
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:51,509
You live long time,

906
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,178
and you alone on this path.

907
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,847
(bowl clanking)

908
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:02,603
(dark ominous music swells)

909
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:13,155
(sighs loudly) The second path

910
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:24,083
is filled with many great
and terrible things.

911
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:27,336
Lots of death and darkness.

912
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:33,008
But through that death, come life.

913
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:38,806
You have much pain and sorrow.

914
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:42,851
You lose your wife to the
creatures of darkness,

915
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:47,856
but you love your daughter
more than the world itself.

916
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:53,362
Soon, you seek out living ancestor

917
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:55,447
west out here in the mountain.

918
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:58,617
He is great warrior.

919
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:00,578
He train you his ways.

920
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:07,084
You become wise and strong!

921
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:10,546
You can face anything because of him.

922
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:12,464
(intense whooshing)

923
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:16,468
(breathes shakily) I see.

924
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:20,222
I am in the presence of greatness!

925
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,601
You, Ranger!

926
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:31,817
You do many great things for many people.

927
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:36,739
So Drustan, creature of light,

928
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:43,162
which path you choose?

929
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:48,208
(dramatic instrumental music)

930
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,592
(apple crunching)

931
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:43,597
(ominous dramatic music)
(apple thuds)

932
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:49,019
(ominous dramatic music continues)

933
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:02,491
(blows loudly)

934
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:07,538
(apple crunching)

935
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:10,833
- You and your poison.

936
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:13,502
Shh, listen.

937
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:18,257
There's a scared little hare
over there in them bushes.

938
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:19,425
Do us a favor,

939
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:20,676
and fetch us some supper.

940
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,180
(ominous dramatic music)

941
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,976
(liquid gurgling)

942
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:29,977
(sword clanks)

943
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:33,981
(ominous dramatic music swells)

944
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,488
You pathetic worm.

945
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:43,741
If not for me, you'd die out here.

946
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:48,287
(apple crunching)

947
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:52,124
(dramatic instrumental music)

948
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:04,386
(footsteps pattering)

949
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:06,722
(bushes rustling)

950
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:08,932
(footsteps continue pattering)

951
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:10,601
- Pardon me, sir.

952
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,228
Can you spare a coin for an old beggar?

953
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:17,191
- Sorry, old man, I haven't any to spare.

954
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:18,692
Be on your way now.

955
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:21,862
- Please, young command,
I only need one coin.

956
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,115
- I really do wish I could help,

957
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:27,034
but how do I know you won't just drink it

958
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:29,036
all away with grog?

959
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:31,872
- Please, sir, I beg of you,

960
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:34,208
won't you help an old man?

961
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,084
- I'm starting to get frustrated, beggar.

962
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:37,127
Be on your way now!

963
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:38,629
I'm searching for my ancestor.

964
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:42,758
- Oh, my dear boy,

965
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:47,221
the only one who lives in
these woods is the Ancient One

966
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:49,348
just over that hill.

967
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:50,474
- Just over that hill?

968
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:51,308
- Yes.

969
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:54,228
- Thanks, old man.

970
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:58,148
(footsteps departing)

971
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:01,318
(footsteps pattering)

972
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:08,367
(ominous dramatic music)

973
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:13,205
(knocking at door)

974
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:15,249
Hello, sir.

975
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:16,667
I am Drustan Lorne.

976
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,127
I'm your kin.

977
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:22,798
I've come to seek wisdom and guidance.

978
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,758
I've traveled long and far to meet you.

979
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:28,762
Please come out.

980
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:30,722
(knocking on door)

981
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:31,974
Are you there, sir?

982
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:37,896
(ominous dramatic music swells)

983
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,404
What now, old man?

984
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:48,574
I told you I didn't
have any coins for you.

985
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:52,411
(dramatic instrumental music)

986
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:04,715
(door clatters open)

987
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:09,344
(door thuds shut)
I had no idea, sir.

988
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:12,139
Please forgive my rudeness.

989
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:13,015
I have coin!

990
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:14,683
I can pay you whatever you want!

991
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:20,647
I've come all this way, Ancient One.

992
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:21,982
This is my chosen path.

993
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:23,275
You must train me!

994
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:25,527
For without your guidance,
I have no purpose!

995
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:29,197
I beg of you.

996
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:32,200
Please, sir, forgive
this misunderstanding.

997
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,412
(door clatters open)

998
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,164
- Apologies, young man,

999
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,834
but I have no time to spare.

1000
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:43,045
I simply cannot train you.

1001
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:45,339
- But I'm your kin!

1002
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:46,715
You're my living ancestor.

1003
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:52,554
- But how do I know you
won't just waste my time

1004
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:54,222
and drink my grog?

1005
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,352
- I've come to work hard
and be trained by you.

1006
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:00,687
The Lady of the Woods
said it 'twas my destiny.

1007
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:03,774
- (groans) I'm starting to get

1008
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,943
frustrated with you, young command.

1009
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:08,153
Be on your way now.

1010
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:12,282
(door thuds shut)

1011
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:15,202
(insects chirping)

1012
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:24,586
You're still here?

1013
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:31,218
(water sloshing)

1014
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:32,761
- [Drustan] No, please!

1015
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:33,595
Sir!
(door thuds shut)

1016
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:35,430
Do you not care I will freeze out here?

1017
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:43,355
(fire crackling)
(Ancient One humming)

1018
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:07,170

1020
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:11,508

(Ancient One hums)
(Drustan sighs)

1023
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:24,021
(Ancient One continues humming)

1024
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:25,188
- I wouldn't.
(liquid sloshing)

1025
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:26,023
(spits loudly)

1026
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,482

1030
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:43,749
(Drustan gasps)

1031
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,876
(groans loudly)

1032
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:49,713
(continues groaning)

1033
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,131
(exhales loudly)

1034
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:55,635
(gentle instrumental music continues)

1035
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:05,937
(animals howl in the distance)

1036
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:13,570
(mystical tones)
(dramatic instrumental music)

1037
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:27,626
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1038
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:32,798
- So what do you think, grog or coin?

1039
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:35,425
- That's coin.
- Agreeing with.

1040
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:39,471
What do you wager, grog or coin?

1041
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:40,597
- Maybe grog.
- Hmm.

1042
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:44,851
And what do you think?

1043
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:47,979
Grog or coin?

1044
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:51,775
You think about it then.

1045
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:55,278
(blow thuds)
(outlander grunts)

1046
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:57,948

(Drustan groans painfully)

1050
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:02,410
(Drustan coughs)
- Why not just knock him out,

1051
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:03,537
then take the loot?
(continues coughing)

1052
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:04,955
- Where's the fun in that?

1053
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:06,498
(blow thuds)
(Drustan groans)

1054
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:07,499
You'll get your turn.

(blow thuds)
(Drustan groans)

1056
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:09,626
Get in there!

That's the spirit!

(fist continues thudding)

1062
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:20,137
(Boss Bandit laughs)
- Get off.

(triumphant instrumental music continues)

1074
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,035
- I'll get you for this one, man.

1075
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:45,203
Mark my words!

1076
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:52,043
(head thuds)

(gentle instrumental music)

1078
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,557
- [Ancient One] Easy.

1079
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:06,391
Relax.

1080
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:11,646
- Are they dead then?

1081
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:13,023
- No more than you.

1082
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:18,987
- How can such disregard
for human life exist?

1083
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:22,199
- Evil has its place in the world.

1084
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:28,997
Where there is light there
must also be darkness.

1085
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:32,959
One cannot exist without the other.

1086
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:34,628
- Are they born of darkness then?

1087
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:40,675
- I believe we are all born with a choice.

1088
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:42,594
We choose our path,

1089
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:47,599
and then fate decides if we
are to be a force for light

1090
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:50,477
or a force for darkness.

1091
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:53,647
- Does this mean you'll train me then?

1092
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:57,317
- What do you think I've
been doing this past week?

1093
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:58,652
- I don't understand.

1094
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:01,071
- When I refused your request to train,

1095
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:06,243
you relentlessly persisted.

1096
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:09,579
You passed the test.

1097
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:14,542
A warrior never gives
up, never surrenders,

1098
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:18,088
and never gives in to the forces

1099
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,715
he has the power to overcome.

1100
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:23,677
- That was a test?

1101
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:24,678
- [Ancient One] Aye.

1102
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:28,139
- I starved for a week,

1103
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:30,767
rest on disgusting water,

1104
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,018
froze in the night,

1105
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:33,895
was tormented by wolves,

1106
00:54:33,895 --> 00:54:37,148
and nearly beaten to death
by a thieving bandit,

1107
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:40,610
and all that was a test?
- Aye.

1108
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,279
The first of many.

1109
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:43,446
- You're a sick old man!

1110
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:45,573
- [Ancient One] And what have you learned?

1111
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:48,034
- That I'm related to a sadist!

1112
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:49,244
- You'll thank me later.

1113
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:56,376
(birds chirping)
(arrow clattering)

1114
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:04,426
(bow whooshing)
(arrow thuds)

1115
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:05,468
- What next, old man?

1116
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:12,434
- Don't let a lucky shot
be mistaken for skill.

1117
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,519
- It 'twas not luck.

1118
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:16,187
That was my weapon.

1119
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:17,397
It speaks to me.

1120
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:22,402
- Maybe so, but skills
still needs to be acquired.

1121
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:27,574
Now, shoot it again.
(Drustan exhales loudly)

1122
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:30,327
(arrow clatters)

1123
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:34,831
(arrow whooshing)

1124
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,916
(Drustan groans loudly)

1125
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:41,671
One day, you shall call upon the elements

1126
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:46,926
to guide you in your quest,

1127
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:49,387
but until that day,

1128
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:51,473
you have much to learn.

1129
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:57,145
(slaps chest)
Again!

1130
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:02,734
(arrow clatters)

1131
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:07,697
(dramatic instrumental music)

1132
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:11,284
(bow whooshing)

1133
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:12,327
(arrow thuds)
(Drustan yells angrily)

1134
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:14,245
Anger.

1135
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:15,288
Yes!

1136
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:18,500
Channel that energy!

1137
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,919
Bend your will to it!

1138
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:21,836
Again!

1139
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:25,799
(arrow clatters)

1140
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:29,677
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1141
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:32,055
(bow creaking)

1142
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:32,889
That's it.

1143
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:36,601
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1144
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:38,103
Listen to the air.

1145
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,647
It's speaking to you.

1146
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:43,274
Do you hear it?

1147
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:46,736
What is it saying?

1148
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:51,032
Wait for it.

1149
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:54,702
Wait for it.

1150
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:01,042
(bow whooshing)

1151
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:03,628
(arrow thuds)

1152
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,090
Excellent.

1153
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:12,095
(Ancient One coughs)

1154
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:21,688
- [Drustan] As much as
I hated to admit it,

1155
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:24,065
the Ancient One cracked my hubris.

1156
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:27,735
I knew he was right.

1157
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,698
Deep down it was what I wanted,

1158
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:35,994
to be trained by the ancient warrior,

1159
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:39,706
to shake off the shackles of weakness.

1160
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:42,709
(pencil scratching)

1161
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:47,505
(mellow instrumental music)

1162
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:54,888
(leaves crunching)

1163
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:02,395
(bag rustling)

1164
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:04,355
(necklace shuffles)

1165
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:06,941
(bag clatters)

1166
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:16,826
- If you are to be a force for light,

1167
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:20,663
you must yield to it.

1168
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:23,208
(sticks clacking)

1169
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:25,043
Submit to it!

1170
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:28,004
(sticks clacking)

1171
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:28,838
(hand slaps)

1172
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:30,215
Respect it!

1173
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:32,550
(sticks clacking)

1174
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:33,384
(Drustan groans)

1175
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:35,094
Honor its might.

1176
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:38,223
(sticks clacking)

1177
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:41,434
Your determination will punish you.

1178
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:47,023
It will throw you in ways
you never thought possible.

1179
00:58:50,151 --> 00:58:52,403
Listen to the air.

1180
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:54,614
The air speaks.

1181
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:58,034
You must train your ears to hear it.

1182
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:02,080
- And so I trained.

1183
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,415
Until I started to hear with my ears,

1184
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:08,336
I was convinced I had no problems hearing.

1185
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:11,756
It was not that kind of
hearing I was lacking.

1186
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:15,218
I was proud, and arrogant,

1187
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:18,346
and I let it rule my being.

1188
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,724
I would learn to be rid of such weakness

1189
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:24,519
and open my heart to true strength.

1190
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:26,563
It wasn't until much later I would learn

1191
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,731
I needed to listen to the earth.

1192
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:31,734
For years to come,

1193
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:33,486
the Ancient One would teach me,

1194
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:36,739
that if I listened to the earth,

1195
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:38,408
she would never betray me.

1196
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:43,037
Eventually, my body learned
to flow with the elements.

1197
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:45,748
I learned how to direct,

1198
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:48,501
then redirect, energy into my opponent.

1199
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:52,797
In time, after weapons were mastered

1200
00:59:52,797 --> 00:59:55,174
and training was completed,

1201
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:59,012
one spoke to me as the
Ancient One had promised.

1202
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:03,766
This weapon would become
an extension of my essence.

1203
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:07,895
I came to truly rely on its being.

1204
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:09,939
We hunted.

1205
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:14,569
We tracked everything that moved.

1206
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:18,781
Soon, I came to know every
creature that walked this world.

1207
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:22,952
Everything leaves an imprint in its wake.

1208
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:25,663
I learned how to recognize it.

1209
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:30,251
I unlocked the power of my senses.

1210
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:33,379
They taught me where I needed to be.

1211
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:36,799
I was ready to become one with
the elements of the warrior.

1212
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:41,721
My years of hard work had paid off.

1213
01:00:43,222 --> 01:00:44,682
But little did I know,

1214
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:48,645
my training was not yet over.

1215
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:50,813
Ancient Father,

1216
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:53,941
I am ready to be a protector of the realm.

1217
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:59,072
It's been 4,000 days since
I arrived at your doorstep.

1218
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,575
I've mastered everything you've taught me.

1219
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:06,954
Please release me into the world,

1220
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:09,916
and to give me your blessing

1221
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:12,585
to fight against the forces of darkness.

1222
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:19,592
- Very well, my son.

1223
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:24,639
You are ready for your final test.

1224
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:28,476
(dramatic instrumental music)

1225
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:45,201
(arrow clatters)

1226
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:48,371
(footsteps crunching)

1227
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:55,169
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1228
01:01:56,045 --> 01:02:01,050
Become a Watcher of the
Woods of the Ancient Order.

1229
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:06,013
One can have the power to overcome you

1230
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:10,727
through sheer force of strength.

1231
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:16,441
You must learn to hear it coming.

1232
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:20,403
(bow creaks)

1233
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:25,032
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1234
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:30,872
(arrow whooshing)

1235
01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:35,543
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1236
01:02:38,546 --> 01:02:41,215
(pants heavily)

1237
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:45,678
You are now ready, my son.

1238
01:02:48,806 --> 01:02:53,811
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1239
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:56,981
(Ancient One coughs)

1240
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:08,659
(bucket clangs)

1241
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:12,205
(hand thuds)

1242
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:16,375
(bucket clattering)

1243
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:21,214
(pensive instrumental music)

1244
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:25,009
(footsteps pattering)

1245
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:29,597
(pensive instrumental music continues)

1246
01:03:31,432 --> 01:03:34,519
(Ancient One coughs)

1247
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:39,565
(intense dramatic music)

1248
01:03:41,442 --> 01:03:43,820
- So Greenwood, what's your wager?

1249
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,279
Grog or coin?

1250
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,074
- Coin.

1251
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:48,991
- Kreiger would have bet grog.

1252
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:51,369
He's in the forest collectin' poison.

1253
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:52,328
Kind of a shame.

1254
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:54,121
He would have loved to see this.

1255
01:03:54,121 --> 01:03:57,708
- You boys best be moving along now.

1256
01:03:57,708 --> 01:03:59,126
- We've only come for
your possessions, old man.

1257
01:03:59,126 --> 01:04:02,129
It's not like we're gonna toy with ya,

1258
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:05,800
and then cut your lights just for sport.

1259
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,302
- I'm warning you thieves!

1260
01:04:08,302 --> 01:04:10,179
- That's rather rude.

1261
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:11,305
Isn't it, boys?
(Ancient One sighs)

1262
01:04:11,305 --> 01:04:14,267
- Boss, let's just take his loot and go.

1263
01:04:15,142 --> 01:04:17,562
- Greenwood, have you not learned by now

1264
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:20,231
I have no interest in this man's loot?

1265
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:23,401
(footsteps pattering)

1266
01:04:24,902 --> 01:04:29,907
I want you
(sword unsheathes)

1267
01:04:30,074 --> 01:04:33,202
to kill the Ancient One.

1268
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:37,456
(intense dramatic music continues)

1269
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:42,295
- Boss, I ain't sure about this?

1270
01:04:44,505 --> 01:04:46,299
- You ain't sure about this?

1271
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:51,512
(intense dramatic music continues)

1272
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:57,184
Why should we let some
wood rat scum like him

1273
01:04:57,184 --> 01:04:58,519
live in our forest?

1274
01:04:58,519 --> 01:05:00,396
Because he's a protector of the realm?

1275
01:05:01,355 --> 01:05:04,775
(bucket clatters)
(footsteps pattering)

1276
01:05:04,775 --> 01:05:06,569
Where was the Ancient One

1277
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:07,862
when my family needed him,

1278
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:12,408
when I needed him?

1279
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:16,203
Off fightin' in some war!

1280
01:05:16,203 --> 01:05:18,539
And then the elves came and killed them

1281
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:21,876
all in the name of honor and light!

1282
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:24,754
(footsteps pattering)

1283
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,172
(blow thuds)
(Boss Bandit groans)

1284
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:27,423
Now, brother!

1285
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:28,633
Do it!

1286
01:05:28,633 --> 01:05:30,301
(Ancient One coughs)
I'll just do it!

1287
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:31,135
(Boss Bandit groans)
(sword clanks)

1288
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:34,555
(Ancient One screams)

1289
01:05:34,555 --> 01:05:36,140
(sword clanks)

1290
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:38,893
(grass rustling)

1291
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:41,938
Run.

1292
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,065
(footsteps pattering)

1293
01:05:44,065 --> 01:05:45,816
(footsteps clomping)

1294
01:05:45,816 --> 01:05:47,276
(Boss Bandit pants heavily)

1295
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:51,113
- No, no (wincing painfully).

1296
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:53,991
(footsteps pattering)

1297
01:05:53,991 --> 01:05:56,702
(feet shuffling)
(Ancient One groans)

1298
01:05:56,702 --> 01:05:57,870
- Sit down.

1299
01:05:57,870 --> 01:05:59,246
Come on, come on.

1300
01:05:59,246 --> 01:06:00,539
(Ancient One grunts)
Come on.

1301
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:02,333
(both thudding)

1302
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:06,170
(dramatic instrumental music)

1303
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:07,463
I'll track them.

1304
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:10,007
I shall return soon.

1305
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:15,096
- No, no, don't not pursue them.

1306
01:06:17,264 --> 01:06:19,850
- [Drustan] They are nearly in my sight!

1307
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:21,560
Why not pursue them?

1308
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:26,899
- Swear an oath to me that
you will not pursue them.

1309
01:06:29,902 --> 01:06:33,656
- [Drustan] Ancient Father,
you do not know what you ask.

1310
01:06:36,742 --> 01:06:39,245
I feel rage and vengeance,

1311
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:42,123
an all consuming hate

1312
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:47,086
that must be extinguished
with their blood.

1313
01:06:48,295 --> 01:06:52,049
- It is that very thing
that will defeat you.

1314
01:06:54,635 --> 01:06:56,095
(Ancient One breathes heavily)

1315
01:06:56,095 --> 01:07:01,100
Hate and vengeance is never
extinguished with blood,

1316
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:11,277
but only grows more
powerful and destructive.

1317
01:07:17,074 --> 01:07:22,079
Now, swear an oath on this
day (breathes shakily)

1318
01:07:25,958 --> 01:07:30,046
on my life that you will
not pursue my attackers.

1319
01:07:35,342 --> 01:07:39,722
(continues breathing shakily)

1320
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:40,723
- [Drustan] I swear.

1321
01:07:42,808 --> 01:07:45,770
(exhales loudly)

1322
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:48,522
- You're a great warrior, my son.

1323
01:07:49,857 --> 01:07:53,611
(pensive instrumental music)

1324
01:08:44,245 --> 01:08:47,414
(footsteps pattering)

1325
01:08:50,334 --> 01:08:52,210
(suspenseful dramatic music)

1326
01:08:52,210 --> 01:08:55,380
(footsteps pattering)

1327
01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:08,184
- I can smell your fear, human.

1328
01:09:08,184 --> 01:09:10,312
Come out and play.

1329
01:09:10,312 --> 01:09:11,897
There's no need to be shy.

1330
01:09:13,107 --> 01:09:15,234
(fingers tapping)
(intense dramatic music)

1331
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:16,318
(dagger unsheathes)

1332
01:09:16,318 --> 01:09:20,573
(intense dramatic music continues)

1333
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:24,535
- No, no, you stay.

1334
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:27,871
Mograh has game for you.

1335
01:09:27,871 --> 01:09:29,331
(Mograh groans)

1336
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:33,460
- Well, well, if it
isn't a peasant survivor

1337
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:35,379
from a town I pillaged.

1338
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:37,715
Wait a minute!

1339
01:09:37,715 --> 01:09:39,884
I recognize your face.

1340
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:42,136
You're the Map Maker.

1341
01:09:42,136 --> 01:09:43,762
- What do you want?

1342
01:09:43,762 --> 01:09:46,932
- (laughs) Caraphinneth,
"What do I want?",

1343
01:09:46,932 --> 01:09:48,434
the Map Maker asks.

1344
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:50,144
- I'll give you whatever
you want, creature.

1345
01:09:50,144 --> 01:09:52,188
Just let me go.

1346
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:55,398
- Oi, Caraphinneth, he called me creature,

1347
01:09:55,398 --> 01:09:57,568
and I thought we were playin' nice.

1348
01:09:57,568 --> 01:09:59,945
Tell me where I can find the Bloodstone,

1349
01:09:59,945 --> 01:10:02,323
and Caraphinneth here won't cause you

1350
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:04,575
a tortured, agonizing death.

1351
01:10:04,575 --> 01:10:06,994
- The only stone I've ever seen

1352
01:10:06,994 --> 01:10:10,664
is hung around the neck
of the Lady of the Woods.

1353
01:10:10,664 --> 01:10:12,082
- The Lady of the Woods you say?

1354
01:10:12,082 --> 01:10:14,126
Why don't you paint me a map?

1355
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:18,339
Do I have anything in my teeth?

1356
01:10:18,339 --> 01:10:19,548
An orc's gotta look his best

1357
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:21,884
when he's meetin' the Lady of the Woods.

1358
01:10:24,094 --> 01:10:24,929
- Here.

1359
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:26,472
This will lead you right to her.

1360
01:10:27,431 --> 01:10:29,058
Am I free to go now?

1361
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:29,892
- Why not?

1362
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:31,227
I'm an Orc of me words,

1363
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:34,605
and I did say, "Caraphinneth
wouldn't cause you

1364
01:10:34,605 --> 01:10:37,273
a tortured, agonizing death".

1365
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:40,986
It's a shame I didn't
include me self in there.

1366
01:10:40,986 --> 01:10:42,446
I wasn't startin' to like ya.

1367
01:10:42,446 --> 01:10:45,866
(ominous dramatic music)

1368
01:10:46,951 --> 01:10:51,496
(dramatic instrumental music)

1369
01:10:51,496 --> 01:10:54,166
(Reina coughs)

1370
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:58,462
- Come here, little one.

1371
01:10:58,462 --> 01:11:03,133
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1372
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:31,537
There, all better now.

1373
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:36,541
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1374
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:40,337
(intense dramatic music)

1375
01:11:40,337 --> 01:11:41,130
Shh.

1376
01:11:42,589 --> 01:11:43,424
Hide.

1377
01:11:46,050 --> 01:11:47,761
(clothing thuds)

1378
01:11:47,761 --> 01:11:50,306
- [Henrik] The girl eats
when she finishes the job.

1379
01:11:51,389 --> 01:11:54,184
You eat when she finishes the job.

1380
01:11:54,184 --> 01:11:55,269
- You coward.

1381
01:11:55,269 --> 01:11:57,730
(intense dramatic music continues)

1382
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:01,567
(dramatic instrumental music)

1383
01:12:06,905 --> 01:12:08,157
- [Sharia] Hmm.

1384
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:12,119
Drustan, you've dropped this.

1385
01:12:12,119 --> 01:12:15,831
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1386
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:17,791
What memories invade your mind?

1387
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:20,335
- Yes, Master.

1388
01:12:20,335 --> 01:12:22,004
Find the Bloodstone I will.

1389
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:24,630
Search every village in
the Grimmock Mountain.

1390
01:12:24,630 --> 01:12:26,258
Oi, I'm no moppet.

1391
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:31,638
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1392
01:12:31,638 --> 01:12:32,889
(intense whooshing)

1393
01:12:32,889 --> 01:12:36,101
- The Bloodstone, what is this artifact?

1394
01:12:36,101 --> 01:12:38,978
- How do you know about this?

1395
01:12:38,978 --> 01:12:39,938
(bow clangs)

1396
01:12:39,938 --> 01:12:43,317
- The orcs who slew my family
and took my daughter captive

1397
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:44,401
were searching for it.

1398
01:12:45,486 --> 01:12:46,779
They seem to think that I,

1399
01:12:46,779 --> 01:12:49,281
or someone from my village,
was in possession of it.

1400
01:12:49,281 --> 01:12:51,450
- Try to understand, Ranger.

1401
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:54,912
The Bloodstone is much older
and larger than any of us.

1402
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:57,581
Forged by the hand of
King De'grun himself.

1403
01:12:57,581 --> 01:13:00,291
Imbued with power that can
rip the rights of creation

1404
01:13:00,291 --> 01:13:02,044
from the gods.
- And what of it?

1405
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:03,754
- The stone is no longer whole.

1406
01:13:03,754 --> 01:13:06,090
Only fragments exist now.

1407
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:09,050
Each one contains the
power of an ancient right

1408
01:13:09,050 --> 01:13:11,261
designed to bring back the Shadow King.

1409
01:13:11,261 --> 01:13:12,179
- King De'grun?

1410
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:13,847
- [Sharia] Precisely.

1411
01:13:13,847 --> 01:13:17,267
- So who is this master
that wants the Bloodstone?

1412
01:13:17,267 --> 01:13:20,853
- Hmm, the son of the king, Prince Korlan.

1413
01:13:20,853 --> 01:13:22,147
(intense whooshing)
Long had the shards

1414
01:13:22,147 --> 01:13:24,775
of the Bloodstone been hidden
in the land of Adrasil,

1415
01:13:25,859 --> 01:13:27,443
long has the Shadow Prince sent out

1416
01:13:27,443 --> 01:13:29,029
his couriers to seek them.

1417
01:13:29,947 --> 01:13:34,451
On a dreadful day, not too
long ago, one was found,

1418
01:13:34,451 --> 01:13:38,789
which led them to the location
of the Etcher of Souls,

1419
01:13:38,789 --> 01:13:40,374
the blade of his father.

1420
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,459
Blood ruins on the blade

1421
01:13:42,459 --> 01:13:44,920
contained King De'grun's soul print.

1422
01:13:46,213 --> 01:13:48,841
It is believed that another
shard of the Bloodstone

1423
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:50,675
is in the Grimmock Mountains,

1424
01:13:50,675 --> 01:13:52,261
which contains the chanting rights

1425
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:54,388
used to resurrect the Shadow King.

1426
01:13:54,388 --> 01:13:58,225
(dramatic instrumental music)

1427
01:14:01,895 --> 01:14:05,315
- Mograh, Lady of Woods
is powerful caster,

1428
01:14:05,315 --> 01:14:07,025
much more than I.

1429
01:14:07,025 --> 01:14:08,902
You must go alone.

1430
01:14:08,902 --> 01:14:09,987
I wait here.

1431
01:14:10,862 --> 01:14:12,698
- You mean to tell me,

1432
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:17,327
I gots to go get that cursed
Bloodstone all by me self?

1433
01:14:17,327 --> 01:14:18,327
Lazy moppet!

1434
01:14:19,371 --> 01:14:22,749
- I stay here and resurrect
you if she kill you.

1435
01:14:22,749 --> 01:14:24,501
You understand.

1436
01:14:24,501 --> 01:14:27,087
Go now, get Bloodstone,

1437
01:14:27,087 --> 01:14:29,298
and bring it back to Master.

1438
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:31,341
He will give you war band.

1439
01:14:31,341 --> 01:14:35,888
- Oh, you sure know how to
make an orc feel needed.

1440
01:14:35,888 --> 01:14:39,725
(dramatic instrumental music)

1441
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:43,395
- [Lady Of The Woods] All these years,

1442
01:14:43,395 --> 01:14:45,981
and the answer is finally here.

1443
01:14:47,232 --> 01:14:50,360
- Well, looky what we got here.

1444
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:51,945
You must be the Lady of the Woods?

1445
01:14:51,945 --> 01:14:53,780
I hear you can see the future.

1446
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:54,615
Wait a tick!

1447
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:56,032
Does that mean you knew I'd be here?

1448
01:14:56,032 --> 01:14:58,368
- Yes, Mograh the Merciless,

1449
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:01,371
I know who you are.

1450
01:15:01,371 --> 01:15:02,748
- So why am I so smart then?

1451
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:06,585
Every other orc I meet is always
missing part of his brain.

1452
01:15:06,585 --> 01:15:07,585
Why is that?

1453
01:15:07,585 --> 01:15:09,463
- You know the answer.

1454
01:15:09,463 --> 01:15:11,465
- I have been brought back many times.

1455
01:15:11,465 --> 01:15:14,593
And to think, I have all
me memories of lives past.

1456
01:15:14,593 --> 01:15:16,261
That makes me a genius then?

1457
01:15:16,261 --> 01:15:19,056
- I know you come for
the Bloodstone, Mograh.

1458
01:15:19,056 --> 01:15:20,474
- Straight to the point then.

1459
01:15:20,474 --> 01:15:21,391
Give it to me,

1460
01:15:21,391 --> 01:15:24,394
or I'll burn this entire place down!

1461
01:15:26,313 --> 01:15:27,940
- [Lady Of The Woods] There's no need

1462
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:29,691
to make threat, Mograh.

1463
01:15:30,901 --> 01:15:31,860
I show where it is.

1464
01:15:32,986 --> 01:15:34,737
But first, your fate.

1465
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:42,621
(dark ominous music)
- Well, ain't I special?

1466
01:15:44,623 --> 01:15:47,416
(bowl clanking)

1467
01:15:47,416 --> 01:15:51,338
(dark ominous music continues)

1468
01:16:09,273 --> 01:16:10,857
- I see two paths for you.

1469
01:16:10,857 --> 01:16:15,862
The first path is quiet, peaceful.

1470
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:18,824
You live long time,

1471
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:21,493
and you alone on this path,

1472
01:16:21,493 --> 01:16:26,498
you will die a painless
way where nobody sees.

1473
01:16:27,374 --> 01:16:31,003
Never to return to this world.

1474
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:35,507
One more life, then it is over.

1475
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:38,635
- What kinda caster are you?

1476
01:16:38,635 --> 01:16:41,722
- The second path, Mograh,

1477
01:16:41,722 --> 01:16:46,309
require you to take my life.

1478
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:49,313
And by so doing,

1479
01:16:49,313 --> 01:16:54,192
the power to resurrect yourself
will be granted unto you.

1480
01:16:54,192 --> 01:16:57,696
You will no longer need the necromancer

1481
01:16:57,696 --> 01:17:00,115
to raise you from the dead.

1482
01:17:00,115 --> 01:17:04,661
You will never taste of death.

1483
01:17:04,661 --> 01:17:08,749
- Clever, it's like an upgrade.

1484
01:17:08,749 --> 01:17:10,500
- Spill my blood,

1485
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:13,712
and this path will lead you to a ranger.

1486
01:17:13,712 --> 01:17:16,298
He is searching for the Outlanders,

1487
01:17:17,341 --> 01:17:18,634
because of you!

1488
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:20,927
You sold his daughter to them.

1489
01:17:20,927 --> 01:17:21,762
- That's right.

1490
01:17:21,762 --> 01:17:23,930
Say, green skins ain't so good

1491
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:26,183
at keeping little children alive.

1492
01:17:26,183 --> 01:17:28,769
It's just to tempting to
eat them for breakfast.

1493
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:31,355
Good thing them Outlanders
is worthless bogs

1494
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:33,982
who'd rather get little
slaves to cook their supper

1495
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:35,567
than do it themselves.

1496
01:17:35,567 --> 01:17:39,154
If only they knew the Master
will make them all his slaves

1497
01:17:40,112 --> 01:17:41,782
when the time's right.

1498
01:17:41,782 --> 01:17:44,868
- Go west of here, back
to the Short Hills,

1499
01:17:44,868 --> 01:17:46,161
find the ranger,

1500
01:17:47,537 --> 01:17:50,165
find the shard of the Bloodstone.

1501
01:17:50,165 --> 01:17:54,127
But remember, since you will live forever,

1502
01:17:54,127 --> 01:17:57,339
you shall be sentenced to exist

1503
01:17:57,339 --> 01:18:01,885
in a never ending cycle of torture!

1504
01:18:01,885 --> 01:18:03,887
- Never dying is torture then?

1505
01:18:03,887 --> 01:18:05,722
Let me think!

1506
01:18:05,722 --> 01:18:07,599
So it's either I live a peaceful life

1507
01:18:07,599 --> 01:18:09,976
and die a painless death,

1508
01:18:09,976 --> 01:18:14,981
or I kill you and live forever?

1509
01:18:14,981 --> 01:18:17,109
- That is right.

1510
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:19,486
So Mograh the Merciless,

1511
01:18:20,987 --> 01:18:22,781
creature of darkness,

1512
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:25,450
which path you choose?

1513
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:30,621
(dark ominous music swells)

1514
01:18:38,922 --> 01:18:40,966
(insects chirping)
(air whooshing)

1515
01:18:40,966 --> 01:18:44,094
- What's your name, young one?

1516
01:18:44,094 --> 01:18:45,594
- [Reina] Reina.

1517
01:18:45,594 --> 01:18:47,347
- Where are you from?

1518
01:18:50,225 --> 01:18:53,186
Are you from the Grimmock Mountains?

1519
01:18:54,603 --> 01:18:56,273
In the Borderlands?

1520
01:18:56,273 --> 01:18:58,191
- By the Coldfell River

1521
01:19:01,361 --> 01:19:03,321
(Reina wincing painfully)

1522
01:19:03,321 --> 01:19:04,156
- May I?

1523
01:19:06,907 --> 01:19:11,163
(thunder rumbling in the distance)

1524
01:19:16,376 --> 01:19:18,879
Do you know who I am, Reina?

1525
01:19:18,879 --> 01:19:20,005
- You're an Outlander.

1526
01:19:22,883 --> 01:19:25,010
- How do you know about Outlanders?

1527
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:26,803
- Daddy told me.

1528
01:19:26,803 --> 01:19:28,221
- Who's your daddy, Reina?

1529
01:19:31,933 --> 01:19:33,434
Does he know where you are?

1530
01:19:33,434 --> 01:19:35,645
- Daddy will find me,
he can find anything.

1531
01:19:35,645 --> 01:19:37,105
He's a ranger.

1532
01:19:37,105 --> 01:19:40,776
(gentle instrumental music)

1533
01:19:49,117 --> 01:19:51,452
(hay rustles)

1534
01:19:51,452 --> 01:19:55,957
(gentle instrumental music continues)

1535
01:19:58,668 --> 01:19:59,710
- [Bjorn] You hungry?

1536
01:19:59,710 --> 01:20:04,216
(gentle instrumental music continues)

1537
01:20:10,263 --> 01:20:13,099
(apple crunching)

1538
01:20:14,017 --> 01:20:15,434
Here, it's yours.

1539
01:20:20,232 --> 01:20:24,693
(gentle instrumental music continues)

1540
01:20:29,866 --> 01:20:32,369
(dramatic instrumental music)

1541
01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:34,329
- [Sharia] Drustan, we're nearly there.

1542
01:20:36,915 --> 01:20:39,835
- Why is it that I could
not find this place before?

1543
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:41,335
I took note of our travels.

1544
01:20:41,335 --> 01:20:44,089
Your tracking was nothing
out of the ordinary.

1545
01:20:44,089 --> 01:20:45,215
How do you explain this?

1546
01:20:45,215 --> 01:20:48,260
- There's a dark shroud
cast around this forest.

1547
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:49,761
- [Drustan] I suspected as much.

1548
01:20:49,761 --> 01:20:51,555
- The Master had his casters working hard

1549
01:20:51,555 --> 01:20:53,181
to hide this place from the world.

1550
01:20:53,181 --> 01:20:54,599
- You've been here before,

1551
01:20:54,599 --> 01:20:56,309
but for what purpose, Sharia?

1552
01:20:56,309 --> 01:20:58,436
- I told you, to fight the Outlanders.

1553
01:20:58,436 --> 01:20:59,271
- Not good enough!

1554
01:20:59,271 --> 01:21:00,105
I need more!

1555
01:21:00,105 --> 01:21:02,273
How can you possibly know where this is?

1556
01:21:02,273 --> 01:21:03,984
- Drustan, let it go!

1557
01:21:03,984 --> 01:21:05,110
Let's move on.
- No!

1558
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:06,152
I've searched too long

1559
01:21:06,152 --> 01:21:09,030
and hard to let any stone go unturned.

1560
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:11,324
Does it not stand to reason, Sharia,

1561
01:21:11,324 --> 01:21:13,285
who are you really?

1562
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:14,286
Why did you bring me here?

1563
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:15,620
- I told you,

1564
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:17,330
to fight the Outlanders,

1565
01:21:17,330 --> 01:21:19,082
and save your daughter.

1566
01:21:19,082 --> 01:21:19,916
Nothing more.
- How did you know

1567
01:21:19,916 --> 01:21:21,001
about the dark shroud?

1568
01:21:21,001 --> 01:21:23,253
And more importantly, how did
you know how to get past it?

1569
01:21:23,253 --> 01:21:25,922
- Drustan, you're looking into
something that isn't there!

1570
01:21:25,922 --> 01:21:27,257
Let it go!

1571
01:21:27,257 --> 01:21:28,341
Let's move on.

1572
01:21:28,341 --> 01:21:30,385
- Your hiding something,

1573
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:32,304
and I want no part of your game.

1574
01:21:33,263 --> 01:21:34,848
(bushes rustling)

1575
01:21:34,848 --> 01:21:35,932
Someone's approaching.

1576
01:21:35,932 --> 01:21:36,808
Hide.

1577
01:21:36,808 --> 01:21:39,477
(dramatic instrumental music)

1578
01:21:39,477 --> 01:21:42,647
(footsteps pattering)

1579
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:47,652
- [Caraphinneth] Wait, Mograh.

1580
01:21:48,778 --> 01:21:50,071
I smell human.

1581
01:21:51,114 --> 01:21:52,365
- That's funny, I smell elf.

1582
01:21:54,492 --> 01:21:57,120
- I'm serious, watch yourself.

1583
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,788
- What are you so worried about?

1584
01:21:58,788 --> 01:22:00,916
I can resurrect myself.

1585
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:02,459
I killed the Lady of the Woods.

1586
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:04,753
Where is this Outlander?

1587
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:07,255
- [Caraphinneth] Patience,
Mograh, he comes now.

1588
01:22:12,427 --> 01:22:14,471
(leaves rustling)
(Mograh growls)

1589
01:22:14,471 --> 01:22:16,889
- You don't scare me, green skin,

1590
01:22:16,889 --> 01:22:19,100
or shall I say pale skin?

1591
01:22:20,018 --> 01:22:24,189
You know, for an orc,
you're quite colorless.

1592
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:26,066
Has anyone ever told you that?

1593
01:22:26,066 --> 01:22:27,359
- Where is the girl pastie?
- What girl?

1594
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:29,778
- [Mograh] The one I sold you

1595
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:32,112
right before I died.
- (scoffs) That's a good one,

1596
01:22:32,112 --> 01:22:34,532
an orc who re-animates himself,

1597
01:22:34,532 --> 01:22:37,285
and tries to claim what
is rightfully mine.

1598
01:22:37,285 --> 01:22:40,038
I wish I had a necromancer by my side.

1599
01:22:40,038 --> 01:22:41,665
Do you charge for this service?

1600
01:22:41,665 --> 01:22:43,124
(dagger unsheathes)

1601
01:22:43,124 --> 01:22:44,166
- Bring me to the girl!

1602
01:22:44,166 --> 01:22:46,544
- [Henrik] Why is she so important to you?

1603
01:22:46,544 --> 01:22:50,090
She's just a worthless peasant
who can't even sew trousers.

1604
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:52,842
- You stupid git, she's
the daughter of a ranger.

1605
01:22:52,842 --> 01:22:55,804
- [Henrik] This ranger
could never find her.

1606
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:57,722
The dark shroud protects her.

1607
01:22:57,722 --> 01:23:00,225
- [Caraphinneth] You
underestimate this ranger.

1608
01:23:00,225 --> 01:23:02,227
He travels with She-elf.

1609
01:23:02,227 --> 01:23:04,646
She leads him to your camp.

1610
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:05,480
- Sharia.

1611
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:09,234
How do you know?

1612
01:23:09,234 --> 01:23:10,902
- [Caraphinneth] I smell them.

1613
01:23:10,902 --> 01:23:12,195
They're close.

1614
01:23:12,195 --> 01:23:13,822
We don't have much time.

1615
01:23:15,073 --> 01:23:16,532
- I'll bring you to the girl,

1616
01:23:17,450 --> 01:23:19,202
but you pay double your selling price!

1617
01:23:19,202 --> 01:23:21,871
- Greedy, predictable, pastie Outlander,

1618
01:23:21,871 --> 01:23:24,040
this is why we'll be friends forever.

1619
01:23:26,543 --> 01:23:30,338
- [Caraphinneth] Now,
Henrik, bring us to her.

1620
01:23:30,338 --> 01:23:35,343
Do this, and I resurrect
you next time you die.

1621
01:23:38,888 --> 01:23:39,848
- Follow me.

1622
01:23:44,144 --> 01:23:45,353
- Drustan, wait.

1623
01:23:46,896 --> 01:23:49,816
- I have no need for your
assistance anymore, She-elf.

1624
01:23:49,816 --> 01:23:52,068
They will leave me back to their camp.

1625
01:23:52,068 --> 01:23:53,611
I appreciate you taking me this far,

1626
01:23:53,611 --> 01:23:56,448
but this is where we go our separate ways.

1627
01:23:56,448 --> 01:23:57,532
- Stupid human.

1628
01:23:57,532 --> 01:24:00,702
You have no idea who you're dealing with.

1629
01:24:00,702 --> 01:24:01,952
- Then tell me.

1630
01:24:01,952 --> 01:24:03,496
Perhaps I shall sway my mind.

1631
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:09,544
So be it.

1632
01:24:09,544 --> 01:24:11,546

- You are not my kin, Outlander.

1665

You betray all that you once were.

What's the matter, Sharia?

1722
01:28:02,318 --> 01:28:04,612
You're nothing without your blades.

1723

- Not so fast!

1761
01:29:50,300 --> 01:29:52,678
I've waited a long time for this.

1762
01:29:53,930 --> 01:29:57,517
Now, pastie ranger,
give me your Bloodstone,

1763
01:29:57,517 --> 01:30:02,313
or witness me cut her
little pretty head off.

1764
01:30:02,313 --> 01:30:05,858
- I don't have the Bloodstone.

1765
01:30:05,858 --> 01:30:08,528
You and your kind have raided

1766
01:30:08,528 --> 01:30:12,573
and killed all that were in
my village searching for it.

1767
01:30:14,032 --> 01:30:15,993
No one has it, Mograh.

1768
01:30:15,993 --> 01:30:19,121
- And I beg to differ, Ranger.

1769
01:30:19,121 --> 01:30:20,581
The Lady of the Woods said

1770
01:30:20,581 --> 01:30:24,502
right before I cut her
lights, you'd have it.

1771
01:30:24,502 --> 01:30:27,130
And if I found you, I'd get it.

1772
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:28,840
I'd live forever.

1785

the Lady of the Woods is, she never lies.

01:32:02,308 --> 01:32:04,727
Oi, Caraphinneth, finish him.

1792
01:32:08,606 --> 01:32:09,440
(Caraphinneth grunts)

1793
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:11,776
(arrows clatter)
(air whooshing)

1794
01:32:11,776 --> 01:32:12,610
(Drustan groans)

1795
01:32:12,610 --> 01:32:13,903
(skin squelching)
(Caraphinneth grunts)

1796
01:32:13,903 --> 01:32:16,697
(whimpers softly)

1797
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:27,416
(Mograh thuds)

1798
01:32:27,416 --> 01:32:30,962
(skin squelching)
(Caraphinneth grunts)

1799
01:32:30,962 --> 01:32:32,838
(Drustan grunts)
(Caraphinneth groans)

1800
01:32:32,838 --> 01:32:34,048
(body thuds)

1801
01:32:34,048 --> 01:32:36,717
(dramatic instrumental music)

1802
01:32:36,717 --> 01:32:37,885
(sword clanks)

1803
01:32:37,885 --> 01:32:38,886
(leaves rustling)

1804
01:32:38,886 --> 01:32:42,139
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1805
01:32:42,139 --> 01:32:43,182
(Henrik pants heavily)

1806
01:32:43,182 --> 01:32:44,225
(bow creaks)

1807
01:32:44,225 --> 01:32:46,727
(arrow whooshing)
(Henrik groans)

1808
01:32:46,727 --> 01:32:48,187
(arrow whooshing)

1809
01:32:48,187 --> 01:32:51,857
(Henrik continues groaning)

1810
01:32:53,859 --> 01:32:54,693
(bow creaks)

1811
01:32:54,693 --> 01:32:56,654
(Henrik groans loudly)
- Wait!

1812
01:32:56,654 --> 01:32:58,906
(continues groaning)

1813
01:32:58,906 --> 01:33:00,532
He is my brother.

1814
01:33:00,532 --> 01:33:02,243
(Henrik breathes heavily)

1815
01:33:02,243 --> 01:33:07,248
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1816
01:33:07,623 --> 01:33:08,541
(sword clanks)

1817
01:33:08,541 --> 01:33:13,212
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1818
01:33:18,675 --> 01:33:19,885
(Mograh thuds)

1819
01:33:19,885 --> 01:33:21,219
(whimsical tones)

1820
01:33:21,219 --> 01:33:25,891
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1821
01:33:29,061 --> 01:33:31,063
- So you'll kill me then?

1822
01:33:31,063 --> 01:33:33,107
Your own brother?

1823
01:33:33,107 --> 01:33:34,817
You have no loyalty, Bjorn.

1824
01:33:36,235 --> 01:33:37,695
You will die!

1825
01:33:37,695 --> 01:33:39,155
She will betray you!

1826
01:33:40,072 --> 01:33:42,907
You know not what you choose.

1827
01:33:42,907 --> 01:33:44,493
- It didn't have to be this way.

1828
01:33:45,745 --> 01:33:48,289
- Your stupid and weak!

1829
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:50,291
Curses be upon you, Bjorn!

1830
01:33:51,416 --> 01:33:52,877
(Henrik groans)
(skin squelching)

1831
01:33:52,877 --> 01:33:56,297
(gurgles loudly)

1832
01:33:56,297 --> 01:33:58,633
(pants heavily)

1833
01:33:58,633 --> 01:34:03,304
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1834
01:34:09,226 --> 01:34:11,312
- Goodbye, brother.

1835
01:34:11,312 --> 01:34:13,606
May you fair better in the afterlife

1836
01:34:13,606 --> 01:34:15,650
than you did in this one.

1837
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:18,402
(ominous dramatic music)
(sword clanks)

1838
01:34:18,402 --> 01:34:21,781
(ominous dramatic music continues)

1839
01:34:21,781 --> 01:34:22,615
- [Reina] Daddy!

1840
01:34:24,157 --> 01:34:27,202
(dark ominous music)

1841
01:34:29,330 --> 01:34:33,166
(dramatic instrumental music)

1842
01:34:44,594 --> 01:34:45,680
- Reina, my child.

1843
01:34:49,892 --> 01:34:53,646
You are so strong and brave.

1844
01:34:56,273 --> 01:34:58,025
You are my everything.

1845
01:34:58,025 --> 01:35:02,697
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1846
01:35:06,617 --> 01:35:09,829
Never forget how special you are.

1847
01:35:15,501 --> 01:35:18,796
(smooching softly)

1848
01:35:18,796 --> 01:35:23,050
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1849
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:23,884
(water rushing)

1850
01:35:23,884 --> 01:35:28,556
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1851
01:35:50,244 --> 01:35:53,289
Reina, love, this is our new home now.

1852
01:35:55,249 --> 01:35:57,710
This is where you stay
when I fight for the king.

1853
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:02,548
You're with family now.

1854
01:36:03,924 --> 01:36:08,596
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1855
01:36:13,601 --> 01:36:14,559
- Hi, Reina.

1856
01:36:14,559 --> 01:36:15,561
I'm Evaline.

1857
01:36:15,561 --> 01:36:17,146
Would you like to come play?

1858
01:36:17,146 --> 01:36:21,776
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1859
01:36:30,701 --> 01:36:32,327
- Thank you.

1860
01:36:32,327 --> 01:36:34,371
- We are not your enemy, Ranger.

1861
01:36:35,331 --> 01:36:36,165
- It would seem,

1862
01:36:36,165 --> 01:36:38,041
given the rare circumstances
of the situation,

1863
01:36:38,041 --> 01:36:40,419
which was the only option that could work.

1864
01:36:40,419 --> 01:36:42,129
I am the last surviving Outlander.

1865
01:36:43,005 --> 01:36:44,380
- Only we know where the hidden camp is

1866
01:36:44,380 --> 01:36:47,175
that the dark shroud protects.

1867
01:36:47,175 --> 01:36:49,844
- [Drustan] I suppose it's the
safest possible place then.

1868
01:36:49,844 --> 01:36:50,846
- For them both.

1869
01:36:53,766 --> 01:36:54,975
- I couldn't agree more.

1870
01:36:56,309 --> 01:36:59,730
(intense dramatic music)

1871
01:37:33,472 --> 01:37:34,306
- Ranger!

1872
01:37:36,934 --> 01:37:41,188
(intense dramatic music continues)

1873
01:37:58,873 --> 01:38:00,249
- [Drustan] It's finally over.

1874
01:38:00,249 --> 01:38:01,083
(bag rustles)

1875
01:38:01,083 --> 01:38:02,835
The long awaited rest.

1876
01:38:04,128 --> 01:38:08,549
I feel free to act, free to serve.

1877
01:38:09,967 --> 01:38:14,471
My sweet Reina safe and
sound with newfound friends

1878
01:38:14,471 --> 01:38:15,764
who have become family.

1879
01:38:17,224 --> 01:38:20,269
Curious how the shedding
of blood does that.

1880
01:38:20,269 --> 01:38:22,478
How it renders preconceived ideas

1881
01:38:22,478 --> 01:38:27,151
of what we once thought were
just and true irrelevant.

1882
01:38:28,277 --> 01:38:29,945
But how did I become this,

1883
01:38:31,530 --> 01:38:32,656
a creature of light?

1884
01:38:33,699 --> 01:38:37,244
Was I forged in the furnace
of war like so many of us?

1885
01:38:38,829 --> 01:38:39,914
I think not.

1886
01:38:40,831 --> 01:38:42,082
I was saved,

1887
01:38:43,041 --> 01:38:45,960
saved by a guardian
who saw better than me.

1888
01:38:47,630 --> 01:38:50,966
Wrapped by sorrow from the
death of the Ancient One,

1889
01:38:50,966 --> 01:38:52,968
I grew powerless to resist the urge

1890
01:38:52,968 --> 01:38:56,013
to track down the thieving
bandits who stole his life.

1891
01:38:56,889 --> 01:38:59,141
A promise I had made knowing full well

1892
01:38:59,141 --> 01:39:00,809
I hadn't the strength to fulfill.

1893
01:39:02,019 --> 01:39:03,145
The flesh is weak,

1894
01:39:03,145 --> 01:39:05,689
and I succumb to the poison of vengeance.

1895
01:39:06,898 --> 01:39:09,276
After many days of tracking,

1896
01:39:09,276 --> 01:39:11,403
I finally took hold of their scent.

1897
01:39:12,737 --> 01:39:14,031
What would happen next

1898
01:39:14,031 --> 01:39:17,117
could only be explained as fate incarnate.

1899
01:39:17,117 --> 01:39:20,537
(ominous dramatic music)

1900
01:39:24,375 --> 01:39:26,335
- For a thievin' bandit like yourself,

1901
01:39:26,335 --> 01:39:28,587
I didn't think you had it in ya.

1902
01:39:28,587 --> 01:39:30,047
- [Drustan] Only two bandits.

1903
01:39:30,047 --> 01:39:31,799
Where's the third?

1904
01:39:31,799 --> 01:39:35,803
No matter, I could just
end them with arrows,

1905
01:39:35,803 --> 01:39:38,389
but they need to be punished.

1906
01:39:38,389 --> 01:39:39,306
- [Boss Bandit] They were ugly,

1907
01:39:39,306 --> 01:39:41,016
(laughs) maybe that was why?

1908
01:39:42,017 --> 01:39:43,978
- [Drustan] They don't
deserve a quick end.

1909
01:39:43,978 --> 01:39:44,853
(fruit thuds)

1910
01:39:44,853 --> 01:39:46,522
(Drustan groans)
(blow thuds)

1911
01:39:46,522 --> 01:39:47,356
(liquid sloshing)

1912
01:39:47,356 --> 01:39:48,523
(blows continue thudding)

1913
01:39:48,523 --> 01:39:49,566
(Boss Bandit groans)

1914
01:39:49,566 --> 01:39:50,776
(blows continue thudding)

1915
01:39:50,776 --> 01:39:52,945
- Oh, you're mad (laughs).

1916
01:39:52,945 --> 01:39:54,196
(blow thuds)
(arrow clatters)

1917
01:39:54,196 --> 01:39:55,072
(blows continue thudding)

1918
01:39:55,072 --> 01:39:56,240
(sword clanks)

1919
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:58,659
(air whooshing)
(skin squelching)

1920
01:39:58,659 --> 01:40:00,327
You and your poison.

1921
01:40:01,996 --> 01:40:03,580
(Drustan groans painfully)

1922
01:40:03,580 --> 01:40:05,708
(Boss Bandit laughs)

1923
01:40:05,708 --> 01:40:09,460
(Drustan continues groaning)

1924
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:18,053
What you're experiencing right now

1925
01:40:18,053 --> 01:40:21,139
are the effects of a
decade long obsession.

1926
01:40:21,139 --> 01:40:22,975
Kreiger here loves his poison.

1927
01:40:22,975 --> 01:40:25,144
Now, I know Kreiger would love to

1928
01:40:25,144 --> 01:40:27,521
explain the details of his concoction,

1929
01:40:27,521 --> 01:40:30,357
but, well, years of
dedication to his craft

1930
01:40:30,357 --> 01:40:31,900
have shriveled his tongue.

1931
01:40:31,900 --> 01:40:33,193
Oh, don't worry,
(Drustan groans painfully)

1932
01:40:33,193 --> 01:40:35,237
his poison won't kill ya.

1933
01:40:35,237 --> 01:40:36,864
It'll just
(Drustan groans)

1934
01:40:36,864 --> 01:40:40,784
incapacitate ya long
enough for us to kill.

1935
01:40:42,036 --> 01:40:44,079
(Drustan continues groaning)

1936
01:40:44,079 --> 01:40:46,790
(ax unsheathing)

1937
01:40:46,790 --> 01:40:51,170
(Drustan continues groaning)

1938
01:40:51,170 --> 01:40:52,796
(footsteps pattering)

1939
01:40:52,796 --> 01:40:53,922
(blow thuds)
(arrows clatter)

1940
01:40:53,922 --> 01:40:56,675
(both grunting)

1941
01:40:56,675 --> 01:40:57,550
(sword clanks)

1942
01:40:57,550 --> 01:40:58,594
(male groans)
(metal clangs)

1943
01:40:58,594 --> 01:41:01,180
(metal clanks)

1944
01:41:06,059 --> 01:41:09,563
(Drustan grunts softly)

1945
01:41:09,563 --> 01:41:12,398
(apple crunching)

1946
01:41:14,443 --> 01:41:17,862
- (sighs) What happened?

1947
01:41:19,531 --> 01:41:21,742
- You were caught in a moment of weakness.

1948
01:41:22,659 --> 01:41:23,535
You were spared.

1949
01:41:26,496 --> 01:41:27,331
- Thank you.

1950
01:41:27,331 --> 01:41:29,666
- But how eager you were
to forsake your oath.

1951
01:41:31,293 --> 01:41:32,127
- Who are you?

1952
01:41:32,127 --> 01:41:33,879
How do you know of my oath?

1953
01:41:33,879 --> 01:41:36,298
- I am the watcher of these woods,

1954
01:41:36,298 --> 01:41:39,050
and I know that you swore an
oath to your ancient ancestor

1955
01:41:39,050 --> 01:41:42,054
that you would not seek
vengeance upon his killers.

1956
01:41:42,054 --> 01:41:45,307
As I said, you were weak,

1957
01:41:45,307 --> 01:41:46,850
and now I have spared you.

1958
01:41:50,353 --> 01:41:51,939
- [Drustan] Spared me from what?

1959
01:41:53,315 --> 01:41:54,775
- An awful fate, my friend,

1960
01:41:56,485 --> 01:41:59,071
one that would consume your every thought,

1961
01:41:59,071 --> 01:42:01,740
one that would lead you straight
to the forces of darkness.

1962
01:42:01,740 --> 01:42:03,242
- And how do you know of this?

1963
01:42:04,326 --> 01:42:08,330
- I was where you were once
after the death, Kiera.

1964
01:42:13,001 --> 01:42:14,210
I was a lost soul.

1965
01:42:15,587 --> 01:42:16,672
The Ancient One helped me

1966
01:42:16,672 --> 01:42:19,133
fight against the darkness that crept in.

1967
01:42:20,425 --> 01:42:21,760
I became a force for light.

1968
01:42:23,637 --> 01:42:26,348
After I pledged myself to
protect the Borderlands,

1969
01:42:27,683 --> 01:42:30,269
I fought the forces of
darkness for quite some time.

1970
01:42:31,895 --> 01:42:34,731
And I remembered the
Ancient One telling me

1971
01:42:35,607 --> 01:42:37,860
of a lost love and family he once had.

1972
01:42:39,903 --> 01:42:41,572
I returned to these part.

1973
01:42:43,448 --> 01:42:45,617
I've watched you train
for quite some time.

1974
01:42:47,119 --> 01:42:51,039
I saw your potential
in skill and the heart.

1975
01:42:52,541 --> 01:42:53,375
(fire whooshing)

1976
01:42:53,375 --> 01:42:55,335
I witnessed his passing,

1977
01:42:57,171 --> 01:43:01,758
and I witnessed your
oath sealed by his blood.

1978
01:43:04,011 --> 01:43:06,680
(intense whooshing)

1979
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:10,559
- It would seem I owe
you a life debt, Ranger.

1980
01:43:10,559 --> 01:43:11,476
- On the contrary.

1981
01:43:13,228 --> 01:43:15,689
It is he who owes you a life debt.

1982
01:43:20,235 --> 01:43:22,779
This here is the last remaining bandit.

1983
01:43:24,198 --> 01:43:26,532
He claims he was forced
to kill the Ancient One,

1984
01:43:26,532 --> 01:43:28,368
that he had no choice in the matter.

1985
01:43:29,912 --> 01:43:32,496
I leave judgment to you, Drustan.

1986
01:43:34,208 --> 01:43:35,666
As rangers in the Borderlands,

1987
01:43:35,666 --> 01:43:37,920
we are the blade of the king.

1988
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:41,005
We are judge, jury and executioner.

1989
01:43:42,257 --> 01:43:44,343
So what will it be, brother?

1990
01:43:46,511 --> 01:43:48,388
Will it be justice or mercy?

1991
01:43:56,021 --> 01:43:58,773
(birds chirping)

1992
01:44:00,108 --> 01:44:03,946
(dramatic instrumental music)

1993
01:44:44,820 --> 01:44:47,614
(whimsical tones)

1994
01:44:49,657 --> 01:44:52,744
(dark ominous music)

1995
01:45:22,523 --> 01:45:24,609
(child chants indistinctly)

1996
01:45:24,609 --> 01:45:28,572
(triumphant instrumental music)

1997
01:46:01,897 --> 01:46:05,192
(gentle ethereal music)
