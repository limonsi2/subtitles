01:01:38,433 --> 01:01:40,131
I'd think you
disapprove of this wedding.

881
01:01:40,174 --> 01:01:43,743
I happen to love
Clara Cox Lenworth.

882
01:01:47,138 --> 01:01:48,748
- Ahem.

883
01:01:48,792 --> 01:01:50,054
- [sighs]

884
01:01:54,232 --> 01:01:57,888
[ominous groaning, thudding]

885
01:02:04,546 --> 01:02:07,245
- Clara, whose
father promised her

886
01:02:07,288 --> 01:02:09,813
to the son
of a fellow Boulé man,

887
01:02:09,856 --> 01:02:12,250
who graduated Howard
the same year

888
01:02:12,293 --> 01:02:14,643
and had a family pew
at St. Luke's.

889
01:02:14,687 --> 01:02:16,994
Clara, whose father
was worth enough

890
01:02:17,037 --> 01:02:21,825
he didn't blink at a wedding
that cost upwards of $20,000.

891
01:02:21,868 --> 01:02:23,217
- Whenever I'm in this house,

892
01:02:23,261 --> 01:02:25,002
I feel like someone's
lookin' over my shoulder.

893
01:02:25,045 --> 01:02:26,351
- Could be.

894
01:02:26,394 --> 01:02:27,744
In this town, someone's always

895
01:02:27,787 --> 01:02:29,136
minding your business,
in particular.

896
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:30,790
[chuckling]

897
01:02:34,838 --> 01:02:37,710
- Clara.

898
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:40,757
I see my firstborn has
finally made his way to you.

899
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,715
- Firstborn?
I'm your only born, Mama,

900
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:44,369
unless you and Daddy
finally fixing

901
01:02:44,412 --> 01:02:46,110
to gimme that little brother.

902
01:02:46,153 --> 01:02:49,069
- Oh, no,
I was just being formal.

903
01:02:49,113 --> 01:02:51,245
I got it from here, Sabine.

904
01:02:51,289 --> 01:02:53,682
Thank you.

905
01:02:53,726 --> 01:02:55,815
[exhales]

906
01:02:55,859 --> 01:02:57,948
Okay.

907
01:03:02,126 --> 01:03:05,651
[stuttering]

908
01:03:05,694 --> 01:03:09,394
Uh, cream or sugar,
daughter-to-be--I'm so sorry,

909
01:03:09,437 --> 01:03:11,700
my memory's been
fussin' me lately.

910
01:03:11,744 --> 01:03:13,572
- No need to apologize,
mother-to-be,

911
01:03:13,615 --> 01:03:15,835
that's how I take it.

912
01:03:15,879 --> 01:03:18,011
- Here you are.

913
01:03:18,055 --> 01:03:20,884
Three more weeks
and no more of this

914
01:03:20,927 --> 01:03:23,843
to-be business--
I will finally have a daughter.

915
01:03:23,887 --> 01:03:25,453
[chuckling]

916
01:03:25,497 --> 01:03:26,759
[house creaks and rattles]

917
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:29,631
- What is that sound?

918
01:03:29,675 --> 01:03:31,546
Cornelius, is this your ghost?

919
01:03:31,590 --> 01:03:33,635
- Maybe it wants
to introduce itself

920
01:03:33,679 --> 01:03:34,854
to the future
Mistress of the House.

921
01:03:34,898 --> 01:03:36,508
- [chuckles]

922
01:03:36,551 --> 01:03:37,683
[groaning continues]

923
01:03:37,726 --> 01:03:39,728
- Hello, ghost.

924
01:03:39,772 --> 01:03:42,035
I'm going to have all these
holes fixed after the wedding,

925
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:43,254
so start packin'.

926
01:03:43,297 --> 01:03:47,084
[house creaks, knocking,
moaning]

927
01:03:47,127 --> 01:03:48,389
- [banging]

928
01:03:48,433 --> 01:03:52,132
[panting]

929
01:03:52,176 --> 01:03:53,786
Cornelius and his father
been talking about

930
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:56,006
ghosts for years--
I think there's some raccoons

931
01:03:56,049 --> 01:03:57,442
in the attic.

932
01:03:57,485 --> 01:03:59,531
And I think they need
to leave.

933
01:03:59,574 --> 01:04:01,315
Yes?

934
01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:03,274
- Mr. Clay
won't be home for lunch.

935
01:04:03,317 --> 01:04:06,973
He sent word that
he's busy at the office.

936
01:04:07,017 --> 01:04:09,671
- That's to be expected.

937
01:04:09,715 --> 01:04:11,891
Could you go and put some
poison down in the attic?

938
01:04:11,935 --> 01:04:14,763
Raccoons are
playin' up again today.

939
01:04:14,807 --> 01:04:16,722
- Yes, ma'am.

940
01:04:16,765 --> 01:04:18,245
- Shall we?

941
01:04:18,289 --> 01:04:19,856
After all of it,

942
01:04:19,899 --> 01:04:22,119
after Sabine told me
what happened,

943
01:04:22,162 --> 01:04:25,035
I realized that Clara
was simply unlucky.

944
01:04:25,078 --> 01:04:28,777
Her father promised her
to the wrong Boulé man.

945
01:04:28,821 --> 01:04:32,999
[growling]

946
01:04:33,043 --> 01:04:38,439
[birds chirping]

947
01:04:38,483 --> 01:04:40,398
[meowing]

948
01:04:50,538 --> 01:04:53,019
- Whose cat is that?

949
01:04:53,063 --> 01:04:55,021
- It's just a stray.

950
01:04:55,065 --> 01:04:57,415
I feed them from time to time.

951
01:05:08,121 --> 01:05:10,297
- So that's
the mystery of the attic--

952
01:05:10,341 --> 01:05:14,171
Sabine's secret cat circus?

953
01:05:14,214 --> 01:05:15,737
- No, ma'am.

954
01:05:19,785 --> 01:05:21,395
- You heard those noises.

955
01:05:21,439 --> 01:05:24,833
Raccoons or ghosts?

956
01:05:24,877 --> 01:05:27,271
- Whichever you prefer,
Miss Clara.

957
01:05:27,314 --> 01:05:29,882
- The true strangeness
in this house

958
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:31,318
was her poundin' on the walls

959
01:05:31,362 --> 01:05:32,885
and livin'
on her spinnin' wheel.

960
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:35,453
- Mrs. Clay spins
to be close to her ancestors.

961
01:05:35,496 --> 01:05:37,324
- Hmm, I hope she
takes them with her

962
01:05:37,368 --> 01:05:39,936
when she goes back to New York.

963
01:05:41,981 --> 01:05:43,722
This one's always locked.

964
01:05:43,765 --> 01:05:44,984
- Yes, ma'am.

965
01:05:45,028 --> 01:05:46,943
- Then it must be 'coons.

966
01:05:46,986 --> 01:05:49,989
Ghosts don't care much
for locked doors.

967
01:05:50,033 --> 01:05:52,383
Open it and let me see.

968
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:56,822
[keys jangle]

969
01:06:03,742 --> 01:06:05,526
- This looks like the one.

970
01:06:12,229 --> 01:06:15,754
[lock rattling]

971
01:06:15,797 --> 01:06:17,756
[door creaking]

972
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:28,071
- Clara had been spoiled,

973
01:06:28,114 --> 01:06:31,465
taught from her first breath
that everything belonged to her.

974
01:06:31,509 --> 01:06:33,598
Perhaps that was true,

975
01:06:33,641 --> 01:06:36,122
until her last breath.

976
01:06:36,166 --> 01:06:37,210
[loud thump]

977
01:06:37,254 --> 01:06:40,605
[choking]

978
01:06:40,648 --> 01:06:42,955
Clara was laid out,
like a strange

979
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:45,131
golden fruit
cut down from a tree.

980
01:06:45,175 --> 01:06:46,872
Clara!

981
01:06:46,915 --> 01:06:49,309
Sabine was the strong one.

982
01:06:49,353 --> 01:06:51,964
- If we don't handle this
right, we're all good as dead.

983
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:53,879
- She knew what we had to do.

984
01:06:53,922 --> 01:06:55,489
- A spider bite.

985
01:06:55,533 --> 01:06:57,796
One of those big brown ones.

986
01:06:57,839 --> 01:07:00,016
Big as mice, they are.

987
01:07:00,059 --> 01:07:02,105
But regular as any other spider.

988
01:07:02,148 --> 01:07:04,629
- Clara was beloved.

989
01:07:04,672 --> 01:07:06,935
News of her death
made all the papers.

990
01:07:06,979 --> 01:07:09,460
"A Tragic Spider Bite."

991
01:07:09,503 --> 01:07:12,854
Most folks didn't believe it.
They told us without words.

992
01:07:12,898 --> 01:07:15,901
The looks at church,
the invitations that dried up.

993
01:07:15,944 --> 01:07:19,731
Theodus fled the condemnations
of Washington for Greenwood

994
01:07:19,774 --> 01:07:22,429
to "build a new business,"
he said.

995
01:07:22,473 --> 01:07:24,823
I begged my son
to take me back to New York,

996
01:07:24,866 --> 01:07:26,564
but he had to save himself

997
01:07:26,607 --> 01:07:28,566
before he could
save anyone else.

998
01:07:28,609 --> 01:07:30,176
He escaped with his father.

999
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:31,960
I couldn't go home with nothin'

1000
01:07:32,004 --> 01:07:35,268
but a damaged reputation,
so I stayed in the house.

1001
01:07:35,312 --> 01:07:38,271
It felt like I spent months,
or was it years,

1002
01:07:38,315 --> 01:07:40,273
spinnin' to keep the devil
out my mind,

1003
01:07:40,317 --> 01:07:41,579
but the devil
was up there, anyway,

1004
01:07:41,622 --> 01:07:43,407
kicking up a fuss.

1005
01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:45,452
Sabine is the only one
who stayed with me.

1006
01:07:45,496 --> 01:07:48,281
The other servants left.
My men stayed away.

1007
01:07:48,325 --> 01:07:51,067
Cornelius was grieving,
Theodus was embarrassed.

1008
01:07:51,110 --> 01:07:53,417
He thought I'd found
the madness I was seeking.

1009
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:55,767
I know he found himself
a new woman.

1010
01:07:55,810 --> 01:07:58,291
I looked deeper into my past.

1011
01:07:58,335 --> 01:08:01,164
I thought the ancestors
were telling me to weave.

1012
01:08:01,207 --> 01:08:04,428
I know now they were tryin'
to tell me something else.

1013
01:08:04,471 --> 01:08:06,517
[doorbell rings]

1014
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:14,873
- Sorry to drop in on you like
this, Mama.

1015
01:08:14,916 --> 01:08:16,701
We won't stay long.

1016
01:08:16,744 --> 01:08:18,181
Josephine's mother's
waiting for us

1017
01:08:18,224 --> 01:08:21,749
back at the Whitelaw Hotel.

1018
01:08:21,793 --> 01:08:23,795
- We'll have some lemonade,
please, Sabine.

1019
01:08:23,838 --> 01:08:25,623
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.

1020
01:08:30,671 --> 01:08:34,110
You look well, Cornelius.

1021
01:08:34,153 --> 01:08:35,372
Like your father's
new woman been

1022
01:08:35,415 --> 01:08:37,374
takin' good care of you both.

1023
01:08:41,029 --> 01:08:43,597
- Negro Wall Street
is just thrivin'.

1024
01:08:43,641 --> 01:08:46,600
There's lots of work down there
for the father-son law practice.

1025
01:08:46,644 --> 01:08:49,168
That's how Cornelius and I met.

1026
01:08:49,212 --> 01:08:51,388
- And what are you
to each other now, exactly?

1027
01:08:56,697 --> 01:08:59,135
- I see you've moved
your spinnin' wheel, Mama.

1028
01:08:59,178 --> 01:09:02,007
Keepin' yourself busy?

1029
01:09:02,050 --> 01:09:04,140
- Cornelius,
I asked you a question.

1030
01:09:08,535 --> 01:09:13,497
- Look, uh,
there's no--no easy way to...

1031
01:09:16,891 --> 01:09:18,937
Josephine and I
got married last month.

1032
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:22,201
- No, not married?!

1033
01:09:22,245 --> 01:09:24,899
- You got married?

1034
01:09:24,943 --> 01:09:27,467
Without telling your mother?

1035
01:09:27,511 --> 01:09:31,036
Cornelius was the key.
He was the salvation I needed.

1036
01:09:31,079 --> 01:09:32,690
It would have been

1037
01:09:32,733 --> 01:09:35,301
cleaner if he'd come alone.

1038
01:09:35,345 --> 01:09:37,869
Cleaner, but still tragic.

1039
01:09:37,912 --> 01:09:40,437
- I wanted you there,
but it all happened so fast.

1040
01:09:44,310 --> 01:09:45,920
We're expectin' a baby.

1041
01:09:45,964 --> 01:09:50,490
[soft scratching]

1042
01:09:50,534 --> 01:09:54,233
[quiet fluttering, rustling]

1043
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:02,110
- Sorry to do it this way,
Mama.

1044
01:10:02,154 --> 01:10:04,156
Sabine.

1045
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,854
That's why I came back

1046
01:10:06,898 --> 01:10:09,205
so you can meet my bride.

1047
01:10:09,248 --> 01:10:11,076
[metal rattling]

1048
01:10:11,119 --> 01:10:12,686
[loud thumping]

1049
01:10:12,730 --> 01:10:15,080
[house creaking, groaning]

1050
01:10:15,123 --> 01:10:17,561
- Sweet heaven, what is that?

1051
01:10:17,604 --> 01:10:20,041
- No.

1052
01:10:20,085 --> 01:10:22,783
No, you won't
do this to us again!

1053
01:10:22,827 --> 01:10:25,308
No!
Racoons or ghosts, I don't care,

1054
01:10:25,351 --> 01:10:26,352
just leave us be!

1055
01:10:26,396 --> 01:10:28,963
