too many holes.

So, what are you meeting
with my dad about?

180
00:08:11,665 --> 00:08:14,232
Well, I just got a job
managing a bar downtown.

You'’ve always had
a funny sense of humor.

That'’s redundant.
But my dad'’s not the one

that you talk to
about sponsorships.

handle it this one time.

Your musical taste runs
from Bruce to Springsteen,

197
00:08:57,667 --> 00:09:00,583
so, maybe we should all
just get back to work?

198

you have dressing rooms

restocked with gin

00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:42,550
-You got a hot dad.
-[scoffs] No, I don'’t.

346
00:15:42,593 --> 00:15:45,422
Uh, yeah, he has
foxy dad vibes.
I'’m sorry.

347
00:15:45,466 --> 00:15:48,208
How would you like it
if I started dating your father?

348
00:15:48,251 --> 00:15:49,905
You'’d be the older woman,
because he'’s dating

349
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,689
his nail technician
and she'’s 22.

350
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:54,997
Yeah, after the third marriage,
it gets a little blurry,

351
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:58,218
but I do get kick-ass nail art
from this one.

352
00:15:58,261 --> 00:15:59,871
Just please be on my side.

353
00:15:59,915 --> 00:16:04,093
I am on your side... always.
Probably just a sex thing.

354
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:05,573
You just gotta wait it out.

355
00:16:05,616 --> 00:16:07,923
It'’s when they think
they'’re in love

356
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,012
-that things get dicey.
-In love?

357
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:12,058
-[door opening]
-[Jack] Emma?

358
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,409
Oh, hey, Charlyne.

359
00:16:17,585 --> 00:16:19,326
Um, could I talk to my daughter?

360
00:16:21,284 --> 00:16:25,985
Yeah, sure. I was,
uh, just on my way out.

361
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:30,163
I actually have a date
with my own twenty-something,

362
00:16:30,206 --> 00:16:32,730
smoking-hot girlfriend.
Up top.

363
00:16:39,302 --> 00:16:40,869
Sorry I didn'’t tell you sooner.

364
00:16:40,912 --> 00:16:42,653
-[door closing]
-I wanted to wait

365
00:16:42,697 --> 00:16:45,091
to see if it was
something real.

366
00:16:45,134 --> 00:16:47,049
And then you were
gone for a while,

367
00:16:47,093 --> 00:16:49,921
and I guess
it was hard to bring up.

368
00:16:49,965 --> 00:16:52,185
"Hard to bring up"?

369
00:16:52,228 --> 00:16:54,361
You negotiate with union bosses.

370
00:16:54,404 --> 00:16:56,537
I'’m harder to talk to
than Fat Frank?

371
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,800
You'’re my daughter.
It'’s different.

372
00:16:58,843 --> 00:17:00,976
And I don'’t want you
to take this the wrong way,

373
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,586
but you can be judgmental,

374
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:05,111
and I was afraid
that you might not approve.

375
00:17:05,154 --> 00:17:07,374
Well, I don'’t.Well, I see that.

376
00:17:09,332 --> 00:17:12,727
You'’re, like,
25 years older than her.

377
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:15,077
Aren'’t you embarrassed
when you go out together?

378
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:17,688
-Why would I be embarrassed?
-I don'’t know,

379
00:17:17,732 --> 00:17:21,605
because you look like
an old fool who'’s being
taken advantage of.

380
00:17:21,649 --> 00:17:23,259
And people feel sorry for you.

381
00:17:23,303 --> 00:17:25,609
In my circles, I'’m a hero.

382
00:17:25,653 --> 00:17:29,135
Guys high-five me on the street.

383
00:17:29,178 --> 00:17:31,311
-Charlyne just did.
-Yeah, well,
that guy'’s a traitor.

384
00:17:31,354 --> 00:17:33,400
They say 50'’s the new 30.

385
00:17:34,792 --> 00:17:36,577
You'’re 54 and a half.

386
00:17:37,621 --> 00:17:39,841
I just never thought
about you dating

387
00:17:39,884 --> 00:17:41,321
anyone, ever.

388
00:17:41,364 --> 00:17:44,628
Does it have to be now?
Does it have to be her?

389
00:17:44,672 --> 00:17:46,848
-Could it be anyone but her?
-Emma--

390
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:51,287
You should be dating someone
your own age. Like Beatrice.

391
00:17:51,331 --> 00:17:54,290
Brandy makes me feel young.
What'’s wrong with that?

392
00:17:54,334 --> 00:17:58,120
What'’s wrong with that
is that you'’re not young.

393
00:17:58,164 --> 00:17:59,817
You have a bad back.

394
00:17:59,861 --> 00:18:01,471
It'’s only a matter of time
before you hurt yourself

395
00:18:01,515 --> 00:18:03,560
doing some freaky sex shit.

396
00:18:03,604 --> 00:18:06,215
You two are total opposites.

397
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:09,000
You'’ve had one job for 30 years.

398
00:18:09,044 --> 00:18:10,654
You married
the love of your life.

399
00:18:10,698 --> 00:18:13,353
She spent the last year
driving cross-country

400
00:18:13,396 --> 00:18:15,224
in a smoke-filled sex wagon

401
00:18:15,268 --> 00:18:16,834
with a bunch of sweaty dudes.

402
00:18:16,878 --> 00:18:18,271
I know this is overwhelming,

403
00:18:18,314 --> 00:18:21,274
but Brandy has brought
a spark to my life

404
00:18:21,317 --> 00:18:22,797
that I really need.

405
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,278
It may not last,
but she makes me happy now.

406
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:28,890
It'’s not that I don't
want you to be happy,
but...

407
00:18:28,933 --> 00:18:30,979
Just come spend
the holidays with us.

408
00:18:31,022 --> 00:18:32,502
Just give her a chance.

409
00:18:33,938 --> 00:18:35,244
I don'’t know if I can.

410
00:18:35,288 --> 00:18:36,898
Well, just think about it.

411
00:18:36,941 --> 00:18:38,421
For me.

412
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,139
[soft chatter]

413
00:19:01,357 --> 00:19:03,272
Dad and I have spent
every Christmas together

414
00:19:03,316 --> 00:19:04,926
since I was born.

415
00:19:04,969 --> 00:19:06,797
We'’re each other's
only family now.

416
00:19:08,234 --> 00:19:10,888
I don'’t think I can spend
a week with him and Brandy.

417
00:19:11,976 --> 00:19:13,717
So, how do we avoid a bloodbath?

418
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:16,981
-Booze?
-Okay.

419
00:19:17,025 --> 00:19:21,160
Or you could take the high road,
get through the week,

420
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:24,119
and let the relationship
fizzle out on its own.

421
00:19:27,905 --> 00:19:28,993
What?

422
00:19:30,038 --> 00:19:31,126
What?

423
00:19:35,957 --> 00:19:38,829
[laughing]

424
00:19:38,873 --> 00:19:41,180
I... I have to do something.

425
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:44,226
If she and Dad don'’t see
how wrong they are
for each other,

426
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:47,055
then I have no choice
but to show them.

427
00:19:47,098 --> 00:19:49,492
Or you could be
the bigger person

428
00:19:49,536 --> 00:19:52,930
and process your emotions
like an adult and...

429
00:19:52,974 --> 00:19:55,542
Break them up.
Yeah, I agree.

430
00:19:57,587 --> 00:19:59,023
I'’ll do it by Christmas.

431
00:19:59,067 --> 00:20:01,287
You got four days, kid.

432
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,940
I can do it.

433
00:20:02,984 --> 00:20:06,335
God bless us, everyone.

434
00:20:07,423 --> 00:20:09,425
[sighing]

435
00:20:09,469 --> 00:20:12,602

[big band Christmas music]

437
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,705
What about
It'’s a Wonderful Life?

438
00:20:28,749 --> 00:20:30,272
Oh, well, that'’s a classic,

439
00:20:30,316 --> 00:20:32,709
but now you like classics.

440
00:20:32,753 --> 00:20:34,233
-I do.
-[chuckling]

441
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:36,539
-[smooching]
-Hey, guys.

442
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,411
Happy holidays.

443
00:20:38,454 --> 00:20:39,629
[sighing]

444
00:20:39,673 --> 00:20:41,501
She came!
[chuckling]

445
00:20:41,544 --> 00:20:43,677
I'’m so happy you're here!

446
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,070
Me too.

447
00:20:46,114 --> 00:20:48,986
And I'’m sorry about the way
I reacted the other day.

448
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:52,599
Um... the news was
just shocking.

449
00:20:52,642 --> 00:20:55,036
Yeah, I know.
Listen, even if we aren'’t

450
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:56,646
spending Christmas
at the lake house,

451
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,909
we can still do
all the same stuff, right?

452
00:20:58,953 --> 00:21:02,304
Drinks at the country club.
Our annual holiday party.

453
00:21:02,348 --> 00:21:04,306
Ice skating on the lake,
if you want.

454
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,265
Of course,
it'’s tradition.

455
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:08,832
Hi, welcome.
[chuckling]

456
00:21:08,876 --> 00:21:11,139
To my own house?
Thank you.

457
00:21:12,358 --> 00:21:14,534
I'’m sorry,
that was rude, um...

458
00:21:15,491 --> 00:21:17,667
I wanted to apologize for

459
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:19,930
calling you a widow-raper
the other day.

460
00:21:19,974 --> 00:21:22,019
That'’s okay.

461
00:21:22,063 --> 00:21:23,847
Hey, fresh start.

462
00:21:27,198 --> 00:21:28,678
What?That...

463
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:31,768
That'’s my mother's apron.

464
00:21:33,161 --> 00:21:35,772
You'’re wearing
my dead mother'’s apron.

465
00:21:39,863 --> 00:21:41,691
Oh, shit.
I didn'’t know.

466
00:21:41,735 --> 00:21:43,084
-Oh!
-Oh! Emma!

467
00:21:43,127 --> 00:21:44,303
Wait, wait--Are you okay?

468
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:45,782
No, no, no,
don'’t touch me.

469
00:21:45,826 --> 00:21:47,741
Okay.

470
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:52,136
Well, that'’s new.

471
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,225
What, this?
Yeah, well, yeah.

472
00:21:54,269 --> 00:21:56,445
Of course we moved
a few things around.

473
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,362
What is that thing?

474
00:22:04,758 --> 00:22:07,891
We went artificial this year
'’cause Brandy has allergies.

475
00:22:07,935 --> 00:22:10,154
Sometimes I--
I get a little sneezy.

476
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,988
Where are all my trophies?

477
00:22:18,032 --> 00:22:19,599
Um, they'’re right there.

478
00:22:19,642 --> 00:22:21,949
We were hoping
you'’d take 'em home.

479
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,389
-I-I need some air.
-No, no, no, no, hey--

00:23:20,181 --> 00:23:21,835
What can I get ya, doll?

488
00:23:23,489 --> 00:23:26,709
What I don'’t need is some kind
of old-timey hipster slang.

489
00:23:27,536 --> 00:23:28,972
Not in the mood, newsie cap.

490
00:23:30,321 --> 00:23:32,411
Just a friendly gesture, ma'’am.

491

Vodka tonic.

492
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:36,806
Coming right up.

[dispensing tonic]

494
00:23:46,729 --> 00:23:48,601
Here you are.Thanks.

495
00:23:49,776 --> 00:23:52,648
Sorry, it'’s just
been a rough night.

496
00:23:52,692 --> 00:23:54,433
That'’s what we're here for.

497
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:55,695
Port in a storm.

498
00:23:57,218 --> 00:24:00,830
God, who-- who says
stuff like that?

499
00:24:00,874 --> 00:24:02,397
You know what?
I'’ll tell you who.

500
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,007
Pretty people who think
they can get away

501
00:24:04,051 --> 00:24:05,835
with anything they want

502
00:24:05,879 --> 00:24:08,664
at regular people'’s expense.

503
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:10,231
I'’m just saying,
you would never be able

504
00:24:10,274 --> 00:24:12,320
to get away with a phrase
like "port in the storm"

505
00:24:12,363 --> 00:24:14,670
if you didn'’t look like that.

506
00:24:14,714 --> 00:24:16,063
Look like what?

507
00:24:19,545 --> 00:24:22,896
Okay, that'’s gonna be $8.

508
00:24:32,732 --> 00:24:35,952
Emma Lockhart?
Holy shit.

509
00:24:35,996 --> 00:24:37,650
You used to be Brandy Barnes'’
next-door neighbor,

510
00:24:37,693 --> 00:24:40,304
-right?
-Yep.

-Shot of tequila.
-That'’s more like it.

516
00:24:50,184 --> 00:24:51,794
I'’ll join you.

-Like "dating" dating.
-No!

530
00:25:25,045 --> 00:25:26,307
How sick is that?

531
00:25:26,873 --> 00:25:28,135
Wow.

532
00:25:29,223 --> 00:25:30,833
You would totally high-five him

533
00:25:30,877 --> 00:25:32,922
if he were here
right now, wouldn'’t you?

534
00:25:32,966 --> 00:25:35,577
If it felt right.Welp, I'’m just gonna be

535
00:25:35,621 --> 00:25:39,320
trapped in my dad'’s house
like The Shining.

536
00:25:40,843 --> 00:25:43,585
I'’m sorry, I do feel like that
would be kind of weird for ya.

537
00:25:43,629 --> 00:25:45,761
-[scoffs] Right? Thank you.
-But on the bright side,

538
00:25:45,805 --> 00:25:47,502
it'’s only a couple
of days, right?

539
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:48,895
You'’ll get through it.

540
00:25:50,374 --> 00:25:52,725
I don'’t know.
Tomorrow night,

541
00:25:52,768 --> 00:25:54,901
we'’re supposed to go out
with my dad'’s golfing buddies,

542
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,511
which... is usually fun,

543
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,383
-because they'’re
like my uncles.
-Uh-huh.

544
00:25:59,427 --> 00:26:01,385
Now it'’s just gonna suck.

-Focused on what?

546
00:26:10,873 --> 00:26:12,832
Do you wanna join us tomorrow?

547
00:26:14,921 --> 00:26:16,618
Are you asking me on a date?

548
00:26:16,662 --> 00:26:18,751
Yeah, kinda.

549
00:26:19,665 --> 00:26:22,015

-No, not really.

But...

551
00:26:23,973 --> 00:26:25,932
if my dad'’s gonna bring
the ditzy party girl,

552
00:26:25,975 --> 00:26:28,369
then I might as well bring
the meathead bartender

553
00:26:28,412 --> 00:26:30,240
and see how he likes it.

554
00:26:30,284 --> 00:26:31,285
Gotcha.

555
00:26:32,155 --> 00:26:34,201
Normally I do like being used

556
00:26:34,244 --> 00:26:36,638
as a pawn in a crazy chick'’s
revenge fantasy

557
00:26:36,682 --> 00:26:38,814
because that means
mind-blowing sex.

558
00:26:38,858 --> 00:26:41,730
But in this case,
I think I'’m gonna pass.

559

-Thank you, though.
-Okay, wait, um,

560
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,214

with me tomorrow?

That'’s cute.

Do we have a deal?

how Brandy'’s boobs have

So, what are we doing here?

600
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:36,845
I figured that we could use
some alone time together,

601
00:28:36,889 --> 00:28:39,326
so I made us
some appointments.

602

What kind of appointments?

You know,
my dad invented the key fob,

629
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:40,648
so I have a trust fund,

630

not that I'’ve ever
taken a single cent of it,

631

because I'’ve always
taken care of myself,
so no, wrong.

Okay, so...

633
00:29:48,438 --> 00:29:50,832
your dad set up a trust fund
because he felt guilty

634

know him as well as
you think you do.

00:32:06,402 --> 00:32:07,969
Oh, thank you,
yeah, Dad and I--

690
00:32:08,013 --> 00:32:10,102
Tom. Hey, Elliott.

691
00:32:10,145 --> 00:32:12,887
It'’s been an interesting
couple of days.

692
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,368
-Hello, gorgeous.
-Looking good, Brandy.

693
00:32:15,411 --> 00:32:18,371
Jack, how did you manage
to land a girl like Brandy?

694
00:32:18,414 --> 00:32:21,330
-[chuckling]
-And how can I steal her
away from you?

695
00:32:21,374 --> 00:32:23,071
I sure am grateful,
every day.

696
00:32:23,115 --> 00:32:26,205
Aw, it'’s easy.
Jack is a great person.

697
00:32:26,248 --> 00:32:30,209
-Cares about his family
and his friends.
-Mmm.

698
00:32:30,252 --> 00:32:33,038
Hey, I'’m here to see
Emma Lockhart.

699
00:32:33,081 --> 00:32:34,996
Oh, that'’s a bit
of a buzzkill,

700
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,303
but she'’s right over there.

701
00:32:37,346 --> 00:32:39,696
Let me know
if you need anything else.

702
00:32:43,831 --> 00:32:44,963
[clears throat]

703
00:32:47,095 --> 00:32:48,140
Hey.

704
00:32:50,055 --> 00:32:51,621
You look like you

705
00:32:51,665 --> 00:32:53,623
came from
a John Wickconvention.

706
00:32:53,667 --> 00:32:55,886
-Thank you.
-Um, I can'’t believe
I'’m saying this,

707
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:57,453
but I am so glad
that you'’re here right now.

708
00:32:57,497 --> 00:32:59,803
-You did bribe me to come.
-"To-may-to," "to-mah-to."

709
00:32:59,847 --> 00:33:01,805
Okay, so here'’s the deal.

710
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:04,460
Apparently, Brandy has
every guy in a ten-mile radius

711
00:33:04,504 --> 00:33:06,897
under some sort
of T&A mind control,

712
00:33:06,941 --> 00:33:10,379
including my dad,
but you'’re here now,
and you'’re my Brandy,

713
00:33:10,423 --> 00:33:13,121
so we just have to give him
a taste of his own medicine.

714
00:33:13,165 --> 00:33:15,123
And you didn'’t have to dress up
so nice, but it'’s okay,

715
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:16,559
he'’s gonna hate you anyway.

716
00:33:16,603 --> 00:33:18,344
I wouldn'’t
count on him hating me.

717
00:33:18,387 --> 00:33:19,606
So here'’s the plan.

718
00:33:19,649 --> 00:33:21,521
My dad is very goal-oriented.

719
00:33:21,564 --> 00:33:24,045
He'’s big on achievement,
and, you know,

720
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:25,655
you have a dead-end job
and no prospects,

721
00:33:25,699 --> 00:33:27,570
and you used to drive
a foreign car, so...

722
00:33:27,614 --> 00:33:30,051
Do you normally get
what you want out of people?

723
00:33:30,095 --> 00:33:31,705
No, but it'’s wartime, so,

724
00:33:31,748 --> 00:33:33,750
you know, people do
crazy things. Hey, Dad?

725
00:33:33,794 --> 00:33:35,448
-Oh?
-You remember
Josh Jamison, right?

726
00:33:35,491 --> 00:33:37,058
The D-student who used
to block your driveway

727
00:33:37,102 --> 00:33:38,494
-with his Toyota?
-That'’s me.

728
00:33:38,538 --> 00:33:40,018
I think so. Hey, Josh.

729
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:42,498
-Hey.
-Well, anyway,

730
00:33:42,542 --> 00:33:44,065
Josh and I reconnected
the other night,

731
00:33:44,109 --> 00:33:46,633
and, I don'’t know,
sparks flew.

732
00:33:46,676 --> 00:33:49,375
Honey.Josh works
as a bartender now.

733
00:33:49,418 --> 00:33:51,986
Oh. Do you garnish
your Manhattans

734
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,466
with maraschino cherries?

735
00:33:53,509 --> 00:33:56,382
Not unless that'’s
a euphemism for a sex act.

736
00:33:56,425 --> 00:33:59,080
Oh! [laughing]
Good man.

737
00:33:59,124 --> 00:34:01,909
-What can I get ya?
-Bourbon, straight-up.

738
00:34:01,952 --> 00:34:03,780
-Bourbon, straight-up.
-Yeah.

739
00:34:03,824 --> 00:34:06,522
What the hell?I mean, we'’re like
two silverback gorillas.

740
00:34:06,566 --> 00:34:08,959
We recognize
each other in nature.

741
00:34:09,003 --> 00:34:10,570
Mmm, Josh.

742
00:34:10,613 --> 00:34:13,355
So, Josh and I were thinking
about taking a road trip.

743
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:14,748
You know, meander around,

744
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:16,880
find ourselves,
pierce some stuff.

745
00:34:16,924 --> 00:34:18,795
-I don'’t know,
go to Coachella.
-Mmm.

746
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:20,145
You should.

747
00:34:20,188 --> 00:34:21,450
You know, I never did
enough traveling

748
00:34:21,494 --> 00:34:23,322
when I was young like Josh.

749
00:34:23,365 --> 00:34:25,150
Emma here,
she works too hard.

750
00:34:25,193 --> 00:34:26,934
-Mmm.
-Probably got that from me,

751
00:34:26,977 --> 00:34:29,850
but Brandy'’s been really
helping me relax lately.

752
00:34:29,893 --> 00:34:31,808
It'’s made me
so much happier.

753
00:34:31,852 --> 00:34:34,637
Who knew that I'’d still be
finding myself at this age

754
00:34:34,681 --> 00:34:36,726
and that I'’m still finding
life so surprising--

755
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:38,554
Oh, there'’s Brandy!
Hi, Brandy!

756
00:34:38,598 --> 00:34:41,035
Oh, your dad'’s great.

757
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:45,822
She'’s lulled him
into some kind of poontang fog.

758
00:34:45,866 --> 00:34:47,346
Fog of whore.

759
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,131
I don'’t know,
some bartender.

760
00:34:51,567 --> 00:34:53,874
[whispering to each other]

761
00:34:55,876 --> 00:34:57,443
Are you ready for round two?

762
00:34:57,486 --> 00:34:59,140
I was born ready.

763
00:34:59,184 --> 00:35:01,751
-Oh, shut up.
-Wow, really?

764
00:35:01,795 --> 00:35:03,057
-Oh.
-Huh!

765
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,015
Josh Jamison.

766
00:35:05,059 --> 00:35:06,756
-Brandy Barnes.
-Come here.

767
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,889
-Hi, babe.
-How'’re you doing, baby?

768
00:35:08,932 --> 00:35:10,325
You'’re really
wearing that suit.

769
00:35:10,369 --> 00:35:11,892
Oh, and you in that dress.

770
00:35:11,935 --> 00:35:15,156
Remind me again,
why on Earth did we break up?

771
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,680
I obviously made
a huge mistake.

772
00:35:17,724 --> 00:35:20,074
Oh, yeah, you definitely did.

773
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,859
-Ooh, someone'’s
been working out.
-Stop.

774
00:35:22,903 --> 00:35:25,166
Hey, so are you still
doing the whole
photography thing?

775
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:27,342
-I am.
-Wow, well,
do you ever shoot bands?

776
00:35:27,386 --> 00:35:29,475
Because, um,
I'’m putting together

777
00:35:29,518 --> 00:35:32,173
a little New Year'’s Eve
concert and we could
really use a photographer.

778
00:35:32,217 --> 00:35:33,609
That'’d be great, yeah.

779
00:35:33,653 --> 00:35:35,263
I could definitely do that.
I'’ll text you.

780
00:35:35,307 --> 00:35:36,786
I'’ll text you.

781
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,005
-Great.
-Great.

782
00:35:38,048 --> 00:35:39,920
-Great.
-Great. Hey, guys.

783
00:35:39,963 --> 00:35:41,443
Oh, babe, you met Josh,
Emma'’s date.

784
00:35:41,487 --> 00:35:43,053
Oh, Dad, she knows.

785
00:35:43,097 --> 00:35:46,622
Actually, Josh is
one of Brandy'’s ex-boyfriends.

786
00:35:46,666 --> 00:35:48,015
-Yes, that'’s right.
-Yeah, yeah.

787
00:35:48,058 --> 00:35:49,843
You'’re the man from her past

788
00:35:49,886 --> 00:35:51,888
that I'’ve got to live up to?
The one who got away?

789
00:35:51,932 --> 00:35:54,369
[laughing]
Oh, God, no.

790
00:35:54,413 --> 00:35:56,371
No, no, no, no,
we were kids.

791
00:35:56,415 --> 00:35:59,331
He was a boy.
And you'’re my man.

792
00:35:59,374 --> 00:36:00,984
I'’m a man, too, believe me.

793
00:36:01,028 --> 00:36:04,031
But you gotta admit,
this is kind of weird, right?

794
00:36:04,074 --> 00:36:07,208
I mean, Josh is my date.
I'’m your daughter.

795
00:36:07,252 --> 00:36:10,037
You'’re her boyfriend,
and she'’s Josh's ex.

796
00:36:11,256 --> 00:36:13,475
Kind of funny.

797
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:15,173
-Right?
-[chuckling]

798
00:36:15,216 --> 00:36:16,739
[Christmas music starts playing]

799
00:36:16,783 --> 00:36:18,393
-Dance with me!
-Oh, sure.

800
00:36:18,437 --> 00:36:19,873
I made it a rule.
Never say no to her.

801
00:36:19,916 --> 00:36:21,353
-You know why, Josh.
-Of course not.

802
00:36:21,396 --> 00:36:23,268
-[Josh] Smart man.
-Yep.

803
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:25,400
[Josh] Wow.

804
00:36:25,444 --> 00:36:27,228
[Emma] We'’re dancing.

805
00:36:27,272 --> 00:36:29,317
Okay, I guess
we'’re doing this now.

806
00:36:35,541 --> 00:36:38,631
Hey, I hope you know,
I really am trying.

807
00:36:38,674 --> 00:36:41,068
Oh, I know.
I really appreciate it.

808
00:36:41,111 --> 00:36:43,375
I think she just needs
a little time.

809
00:36:43,418 --> 00:36:45,290
Yeah. Come here.

810
00:36:51,383 --> 00:36:53,472
Ow! Okay.

811
00:36:53,515 --> 00:36:55,256
What are we doing here?

812
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,519
I'’m just trying to make the show
a little more convincing.

813
00:36:57,563 --> 00:37:00,870
-[whispering indistinctly]
-Very nice.

814
00:37:00,914 --> 00:37:03,482
Some participation
from you would help.

815
00:37:03,525 --> 00:37:06,224
I thought my part'’s
just letting you fondle me.

816
00:37:06,876 --> 00:37:08,095
I got it.

817
00:37:09,444 --> 00:37:11,577
That'’s nice, yes.

818
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,969
There, you got it.

819
00:37:13,013 --> 00:37:14,667
[laughing]

820
00:37:17,713 --> 00:37:19,933
Oh, my God, they'’re looking.
I'’m trying to make a point.

821
00:37:19,976 --> 00:37:22,675
Would you just
help me out here?Yes, yes.

822
00:37:28,158 --> 00:37:30,378
Oh, my God, kill me.

823
00:37:30,422 --> 00:37:32,772
Let'’s just give 'em a second.

824
00:37:32,815 --> 00:37:34,426
-Probably the wrong move.
-Yep.

825
00:37:34,469 --> 00:37:36,689
-Okay, I'’m sorry.
Um, that was bad.
-Yep.

826
00:38:02,541 --> 00:38:04,151
[line ringing]

827
00:38:04,194 --> 00:38:06,153
I'’m sorry,
I'’m sorry, hold on.

828
00:38:06,196 --> 00:38:07,807
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

829
00:38:09,374 --> 00:38:12,377
Let me guess, the sabotage isn'’t
going according to plan.

830
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,857
That'’s an understatement.

831
00:38:14,901 --> 00:38:18,513
No, no matter how hard I try
to undermine Brandy and Dad,

832
00:38:18,557 --> 00:38:21,037
they somehow rise above it.

833
00:38:21,081 --> 00:38:24,389
I even brought Brandy'’s
ex-boyfriend to dinner,
and he'’s so...

834
00:38:24,432 --> 00:38:27,130
-Back up, you did what?
-Never mind.

835
00:38:27,174 --> 00:38:31,352
You know, I may have
lost the battle tonight,
but tomorrow is a new day.

836
00:38:31,396 --> 00:38:33,876
And it will be filled
with family traditions

837
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,575
that will remind Brandy
that Dad and I are a unit.

838
00:38:36,618 --> 00:38:38,664
She'’s the third wheel.

839
00:38:38,707 --> 00:38:42,798
Okay, so you'’re gonna use
your childhood memories
for evil?

840
00:38:42,842 --> 00:38:44,757
No. She can'’t just
show up on Christmas

841
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,367
and wave her magic tits around

842
00:38:46,411 --> 00:38:48,369
and think she'’s instantly
part of this family.

843
00:38:48,413 --> 00:38:50,066
I'’ve earned my spot.

844
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:52,591
Well, you were
sort of born into it.

845
00:38:52,634 --> 00:38:55,028
You should'’ve
seen her, Charlyne.

846
00:38:55,071 --> 00:38:58,901
Cooking dinner
in my childhood home
like she'’s my mother.

847
00:38:58,945 --> 00:39:00,816
And then trying to be my friend.

848
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:03,036
And then flirting with my date

849
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:05,168
in my face.

850
00:39:05,212 --> 00:39:07,997
I'’m sorry, what is it
that you'’re mad about right now?

851
00:39:08,781 --> 00:39:10,260
All of it.

852
00:39:13,263 --> 00:39:15,309
Will you come over
Christmas Day?

853
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,355
I don'’t know
if I can handle it alone.

854
00:39:17,398 --> 00:39:19,313
No-- I don'’t do well
with family drama.

855
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,315
That'’s why I'm not spending
the holidays with mine.

856
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,492
I can never pick a side.
Drunks versus racists.

857
00:39:25,798 --> 00:39:27,582
I know it'’s a lot to ask.

858
00:39:28,496 --> 00:39:29,758
But I guess I'’m asking.

859
00:39:29,802 --> 00:39:31,281
[groaning]

860
00:39:31,325 --> 00:39:33,414
If it'’ll help
put an end to this whole thing

861
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:35,677
and end this phone call,
I will do it.

862
00:39:36,852 --> 00:39:39,289
It will, I promise.
I love you.

863
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:41,814
Okay, love you, bye.
I'’m so sorry.

864
00:39:46,732 --> 00:39:47,776
[beeping]

865
00:39:49,778 --> 00:39:51,911
[sleigh bells jingling]

866
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,218
Who wore them better?

867
00:39:55,262 --> 00:39:57,960
Yeah, well, clearly I did.

868
00:39:58,004 --> 00:40:00,093
If I don'’t look good,
you don'’t look good.

869
00:40:00,136 --> 00:40:01,877
[laughing]

870
00:40:03,836 --> 00:40:06,012
Oh, what'’s all this?

871
00:40:06,055 --> 00:40:08,536
Just your standard uniform
for cookie baking

872
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,320
-and tree decorating day.
-Oh.

873
00:40:10,364 --> 00:40:12,627
-Mmm.
-I didn'’t get the memo.

874
00:40:12,671 --> 00:40:14,629
This tastes just like
your mom'’s.

875
00:40:14,673 --> 00:40:16,414
They'’re not
as good as hers, but...

876
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:21,244
Wow, cookies for breakfast.

877
00:40:21,288 --> 00:40:24,509
Thank you. Usually
I'’d be getting the spins
around this time of day.

878
00:40:24,552 --> 00:40:25,901
Coffee.Mmm-hmm.

879
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,209
Oh, there are mugs too?
That'’s cute.

880
00:40:31,037 --> 00:40:32,473
Sorry, only two.

881
00:40:35,476 --> 00:40:36,564
Here you go.

882
00:40:40,873 --> 00:40:43,441
Mmm, let'’s decorate that tree.

883
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:46,182
Perfect.

884
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:03,025
Oh, we can'’t forget these ones.

885
00:41:04,287 --> 00:41:05,375
Oh...

886
00:41:05,419 --> 00:41:07,377
How adorable is this?

887
00:41:07,421 --> 00:41:10,250
-[chuckling]
-That'’s one of my favorites.

888
00:41:10,293 --> 00:41:12,513
Aw, I don'’t remember making
anything like that growing up,

889
00:41:12,557 --> 00:41:16,299
but I guess we were
more of a tinsel family.

890
00:41:16,343 --> 00:41:18,954
Don'’t worry.
I got us an ornament too.

891
00:41:18,998 --> 00:41:20,521
Here, look.

892
00:41:20,565 --> 00:41:21,827
Thank you.

893
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:22,958
-You like it?
-Yes!

894
00:41:23,002 --> 00:41:24,612
-Nice, right?
-[grunts]

895
00:41:24,656 --> 00:41:26,571
Here. Here.
Come on, let'’s hang it up.

896
00:41:26,614 --> 00:41:29,095
-Near the top.
-Okay, okay, give me a boost.

897
00:41:29,138 --> 00:41:31,401
[squealing, laughing]

898
00:41:31,445 --> 00:41:33,316
-Perfect.
-I love it.

899
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,579
Thank you, babe.

900
00:41:34,622 --> 00:41:36,189
-Look at that.
-It'’s beautiful.

901
00:41:36,232 --> 00:41:37,930
[clears throat]

902
00:41:38,974 --> 00:41:40,846
All right,
it'’s photo album time.

903
00:41:44,763 --> 00:41:47,635
-So cute. Wait, wait.
-[chuckling]

904
00:41:50,595 --> 00:41:51,987
Oh...

905
00:41:55,077 --> 00:41:57,123
-Remember that?
-Yeah.

906
00:41:57,166 --> 00:41:58,777
[both laughing]

907
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,343
[both] Oh.

908
00:42:00,387 --> 00:42:01,649
You have to give us credit.

909
00:42:01,693 --> 00:42:03,129
We really landed
our single axel.

910
00:42:03,172 --> 00:42:05,740
Yeah, but then
you totally wiped out

911
00:42:05,784 --> 00:42:07,916
-in spectacular fashion.
-[chuckling]

912
00:42:10,484 --> 00:42:12,573
I really love that lake house.

913
00:42:12,617 --> 00:42:14,009
Such great memories there.

914
00:42:14,053 --> 00:42:15,794
Yeah.

915
00:42:17,709 --> 00:42:20,581
Oh, I'’m sorry,
maybe this isn'’t the best time.

916
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:22,104
Oh, no, no, no, I love it.

917
00:42:22,148 --> 00:42:24,890
I-- I wanna know
about your family traditions

918
00:42:24,933 --> 00:42:26,456
because it'’s part of you.

919
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,720
[chuckling]
I don'’t know.

920
00:42:45,084 --> 00:42:46,912
How great is she, huh?

921
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,089
So great.

922
00:42:52,221 --> 00:42:54,484
We should get ready
for the party.

923
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:05,234
Your mom was pretty.

924
00:43:07,497 --> 00:43:08,673
She was.

925
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,153
She was also
a lot more than that.

926
00:43:11,197 --> 00:43:13,329
I know.

927
00:43:15,157 --> 00:43:17,638
Sorry, but you didn'’t
really know my mom.

928
00:43:20,206 --> 00:43:23,992
You know, the year before
my parents got divorced,

929
00:43:24,036 --> 00:43:26,038
it would get pretty ugly
in our house.

930
00:43:27,474 --> 00:43:30,129
So sometimes
I would just leave and...

931
00:43:30,172 --> 00:43:34,263
walk anywhere
for as long as I could.

932
00:43:36,135 --> 00:43:38,006
And then one day,
your mom drove by,

933
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:39,617
and she picked me up.

934
00:43:40,705 --> 00:43:43,142
We went and had coffee,
and we talked.

935
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,145
And we probably did that

936
00:43:46,188 --> 00:43:47,929
five or six times.

937
00:43:49,931 --> 00:43:51,324
She never said anything.

938
00:43:51,367 --> 00:43:53,718
She probably knew
it would embarrass me.

939
00:43:53,761 --> 00:43:55,850
It was kind of
our little secret.

940
00:43:57,417 --> 00:43:59,549
But she really
saved me back then.

941
00:44:01,943 --> 00:44:04,119
That'’s the kind of person
that she was.

942
00:44:08,123 --> 00:44:10,691
Oh, I'’ve been meaning
to show you this.

943
00:44:10,735 --> 00:44:12,998
I found it in my old room.

944
00:44:13,041 --> 00:44:14,782
Look at that.
[chuckling]

945
00:44:14,826 --> 00:44:17,742
Were we actually friends
for a minute back then?

946
00:44:17,785 --> 00:44:19,439
Yeah, I think so.

947
00:44:28,535 --> 00:44:30,493
So...

948
00:44:30,537 --> 00:44:32,713
uh, the party tonight,

949
00:44:32,757 --> 00:44:35,847
it'’s gonna be
an interesting mix of people.

950
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:37,370
What does that mean?

951
00:44:37,413 --> 00:44:38,937
My friends and coworkers,

952
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,808
Dad'’s friends and coworkers

953
00:44:40,852 --> 00:44:42,549
and some of your old buddies

954
00:44:42,592 --> 00:44:44,899
that Dad probably
hasn'’t met yet.

955
00:44:46,422 --> 00:44:48,729
Blaze, Stretch, No-Neck,

956
00:44:48,773 --> 00:44:51,340
the old gang from detention.

957
00:44:51,384 --> 00:44:53,342
[laughing]

958
00:44:55,083 --> 00:44:56,476
Well played.

959
00:45:05,659 --> 00:45:08,227
[hip-hop song playing]

960
00:45:14,102 --> 00:45:16,583
Why does it feel like
an eighth grade dance in here?

961
00:45:16,626 --> 00:45:18,280
Oh, that'’s because our friends

962
00:45:18,324 --> 00:45:20,369
and Brandy'’s friends
have nothing in common,

963
00:45:20,413 --> 00:45:22,850
which hopefully Dad is
finding that out right now.

964
00:45:22,894 --> 00:45:24,809
[Charlyne]
Which one'’s No-Neck?

965
00:45:24,852 --> 00:45:26,245
[Emma]
The one with no neck.

966
00:45:27,594 --> 00:45:29,291
We are definitely

967
00:45:29,335 --> 00:45:30,945
the coolest ones here.

968
00:45:30,989 --> 00:45:32,904
For sure.Mmm.

969
00:45:32,947 --> 00:45:34,732
Why does it feel
like a morgue in here?

970
00:45:34,775 --> 00:45:35,863
Oh, it'’s by design.

971
00:45:37,778 --> 00:45:39,519
Josh, this is Charlyne.

972
00:45:39,562 --> 00:45:40,955
Yeah, that tracks.

973
00:45:41,956 --> 00:45:43,523
And this is Beatrice.

974
00:45:43,566 --> 00:45:46,569
-Hey there, honey.
-How'’s it going, Beatrice?

975
00:45:46,613 --> 00:45:48,310
Dude, she got game.

976
00:45:48,354 --> 00:45:50,878
-[laughing]
-Yeah, she does.

977
00:45:52,662 --> 00:45:56,144
-Hey.
-So, what did you think
of Brandy'’s old gang?

978
00:45:57,363 --> 00:45:59,452
-Interesting folks.
-They are.

979
00:45:59,495 --> 00:46:01,367
But I was just saying,
we need to do something

980
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:03,325
to liven up this party.

981
00:46:04,109 --> 00:46:06,459
I know one sure thing

982
00:46:06,502 --> 00:46:08,504
that works every time.

983
00:46:08,548 --> 00:46:11,769
Oh, yeah.
Beer-lympics.

984
00:46:11,812 --> 00:46:15,207
-Beer-lympics!
-[cheering]

985
00:46:16,686 --> 00:46:18,688
-Get the shots.
-It'’s tradition.

986
00:46:19,472 --> 00:46:20,778
Salud.

987
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:27,262
Put it on your head.This isn'’t really
my kind of night.

988
00:46:27,306 --> 00:46:29,830
-Put it on your head.
-This is great.

989
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,615
[Josh]
All right, who'’s next?

990
00:46:33,834 --> 00:46:35,749
-[bell dinging]
-[cheering]

991
00:46:37,316 --> 00:46:38,839
[people]
Go! Go! Go!

992
00:46:38,883 --> 00:46:43,017
Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go!

993
00:46:44,497 --> 00:46:46,107
[cheering]

994
00:46:46,151 --> 00:46:48,849
Does he really have to take
his shirt off to do that?

995
00:46:48,893 --> 00:46:51,025
[cheering]

996
00:46:51,069 --> 00:46:53,245
[Emma]
Does she even own pants?

997
00:46:56,857 --> 00:46:58,772
Hold my beer.

998
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,339
Dad-- Dad?

999
00:47:01,209 --> 00:47:03,777
[voices drowned out by cheers]

1000
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:06,214
-[cheering]
-Shit.

1001
00:47:09,914 --> 00:47:12,133
-[bell ringing]
-[cheering]

1002
00:47:15,528 --> 00:47:17,225
[crowd murmurs]

1003
00:47:17,269 --> 00:47:19,184
-[Josh] Okay.
-[cheering]

1004
00:47:19,227 --> 00:47:20,794
Here we go!

1005
00:47:22,274 --> 00:47:25,190
Dad? Dad, you don'’t need
to take that-- Oh!

1006
00:47:25,233 --> 00:47:27,409
[cheering]

1007
00:47:27,453 --> 00:47:28,976
Yeah!

1008
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,067
[cheering]

1009
00:47:33,111 --> 00:47:35,243
[rock music continues]

1010
00:47:38,986 --> 00:47:41,336
-What'’s going on?
-Arm wrestling.

1011
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:43,338
-I'’m taking bets.
-Whah!

1012
00:47:43,382 --> 00:47:44,818
-You too, Bea?
-Yeah!

1013
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:47,386
-[cheering]
-[bell ringing]

1014
00:47:47,429 --> 00:47:49,431
I am taking bets!

1015
00:47:49,475 --> 00:47:51,564
Taking bets!
Give me that money.

1016
00:47:51,607 --> 00:47:54,436
Okay, thank you. All right.

1017
00:47:56,612 --> 00:47:58,919
[cheering]

1018
00:47:58,963 --> 00:48:03,097
Oh, shit!
Sucks for all of you.

1019
00:48:03,141 --> 00:48:07,188
-[cheering]
-Four over here, thank you!

1020
00:48:07,232 --> 00:48:09,451
[cheering]

1021
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,586
Money? Yes. Yes!

1022
00:48:13,629 --> 00:48:15,893
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

1023
00:48:15,936 --> 00:48:17,242
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Dad,

1024
00:48:17,285 --> 00:48:19,374
you don'’t need to--
Please don'’t.

1025
00:48:19,418 --> 00:48:21,724
-No, no, no, I got this.
-[man] Come on.

1026
00:48:21,768 --> 00:48:25,598
-[hard rock playing]
-Okay, okay.

1027
00:48:25,641 --> 00:48:28,949
Go easy on him,
he'’s got a bad back.
You got this, baby.

1028
00:48:28,993 --> 00:48:30,603
[Brandy]
Come on, Jack!

1029
00:48:30,646 --> 00:48:32,300
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack...

00:48:32,344 --> 00:48:35,477
[continues chanting]

1031
00:48:35,521 --> 00:48:38,089
[cheering]

1032
00:48:38,132 --> 00:48:40,613
Aah!

1033
00:48:40,656 --> 00:48:42,006
Gotcha!

1034
00:48:42,049 --> 00:48:43,572
[cheering continues]

1035
00:48:43,616 --> 00:48:45,313
Baby! Yeah!

1036
00:48:45,357 --> 00:48:47,533
Told you you had
a hot dad, whoo!

1037
00:48:51,015 --> 00:48:54,148
-[cheering]
-[bell ringing]

1038
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:03,114
-Dad, no.
-You ready, Gramps?

1039
00:49:03,157 --> 00:49:06,073
Dad, should you really be doing
a keg roll with your back?

1040
00:49:06,117 --> 00:49:08,075
Maybe you should
sit this one out.

1041
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:09,337
No way.

1042
00:49:09,381 --> 00:49:10,860
We each have a medal.

1043
00:49:10,904 --> 00:49:13,602
Tiebreaker.

1044
00:49:13,646 --> 00:49:16,431
Do you really feel good
about beating a man
25 years older than you

1045
00:49:16,475 --> 00:49:19,739
in a physical challenge?
Just be the bigger person.

1046
00:49:19,782 --> 00:49:21,262
You'’re telling me to be
the bigger person?

1047
00:49:21,306 --> 00:49:24,048
You'’re not competing
against him for anything.

1048
00:49:24,091 --> 00:49:26,050
Unless... you are...

1049
00:49:26,093 --> 00:49:28,356
fighting with him
for Brandy or something.

1050
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,099
Of course not.
But what if I was?

1051
00:49:32,143 --> 00:49:34,014
That'’d only be
helping you, right?

1052
00:49:35,537 --> 00:49:36,669
[whistling]

1053
00:49:36,712 --> 00:49:40,107
[overlapping voices]

1054
00:49:40,151 --> 00:49:42,022
[grunting, groaning]

1055
00:49:42,066 --> 00:49:44,198
Oh, Dad! Oh!

1056
00:49:44,242 --> 00:49:46,157
-Oh, my God!
-Dad, are you okay?

1057
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,159
Oh, I'’ve got him, I've got him.
He has to lay flat.

1058
00:49:48,202 --> 00:49:50,552
[overlapping hollers]

1059
00:49:50,596 --> 00:49:53,077
Ah, yeah, I'’m fine.

1060
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,687
I'’m fine, I'm fine.

1061
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:57,342
Ugh, fine.
I just... oh!

1062
00:49:57,385 --> 00:49:59,170
-Sorry, dude.
-I just need to pop it back.

1063
00:49:59,213 --> 00:50:01,259
No, I got you.
Turn around.

1064
00:50:01,302 --> 00:50:03,478
I-- This doesn'’t seem
like a good idea.

1065
00:50:03,522 --> 00:50:05,437
It'’s deep in there?
All right. Here we go.

1066
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:06,786
-Yeah, okay, yeah.
-Ready?

1067
00:50:06,829 --> 00:50:08,309
-[all groaning]
-Oh, my God!

1068
00:50:08,353 --> 00:50:09,963
-One more, maybe faster.
-One more, one more.

1069
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,356
-One more.
-Yeah. A little faster.

1070
00:50:11,399 --> 00:50:12,792
-Oh, God!
-That'’s not getting it.

1071
00:50:12,835 --> 00:50:14,315
-Get him.
-Maybe do me from behind.

1072
00:50:14,359 --> 00:50:15,664
-Behind? All right.
-Yeah.

1073
00:50:15,708 --> 00:50:17,188
-It'’s deep in there.
-Yeah, yeah, no.

1074
00:50:17,231 --> 00:50:19,712
-I can barely get it.
-Okay, this is not--

1075
00:50:19,755 --> 00:50:21,931
-Oh, God.
-Oh, God.

1076
00:50:21,975 --> 00:50:24,108
Oh, wow!
[laughing]

1077
00:50:24,151 --> 00:50:25,848
Ah, I feel so satisfied.

1078
00:50:25,892 --> 00:50:27,502
This is for you, champ.

1079
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:29,722
-[cheering]
-Later.

1080
00:50:29,765 --> 00:50:31,767
-Later, man.
-[cheering]

1081
00:50:31,811 --> 00:50:33,378
Baby, maybe
we should get you home.

1082
00:50:33,421 --> 00:50:34,857
Yeah, maybe
I'’ll call a car.

1083
00:50:34,901 --> 00:50:36,337
-Dad, I'’ll take you.
-No, we'’re hosting

1084
00:50:36,381 --> 00:50:37,991
this party,
we can'’t all leave.

1085
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:39,862
You guys stay.
I'’ll go home.

1086
00:50:39,906 --> 00:50:41,951
You stay and have fun.
That'’s an order.

1087
00:50:44,824 --> 00:50:47,696
-I'’m so proud of you, babe.
-[muttering]

1088
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:49,089
[laughing]

1089
00:50:49,133 --> 00:50:50,612
That'’s a legend
right there, everyone.

1090
00:50:50,656 --> 00:50:51,918
-[murmurs]
-[sighing]

1091
00:50:51,961 --> 00:50:54,051
Okay.
Who wants to do shots?

1092
00:50:54,094 --> 00:50:58,490
[cheering]

1093
00:50:58,533 --> 00:51:01,580
[hip-hop music playing]

1094
00:51:01,623 --> 00:51:03,364
[Emma] How am I ever
supposed to trust her?

1095
00:51:03,408 --> 00:51:05,192
That she'’s not
gonna hurt my dad?

1096
00:51:05,236 --> 00:51:07,716
You trust him.
And he'’s a grown-ass man

1097
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,718
who can make
his own decisions.

1098
00:51:09,762 --> 00:51:11,111
I do trust him.

1099
00:51:11,155 --> 00:51:12,895
All right,
then let it go.

1100
00:51:12,939 --> 00:51:15,724
Maybe worry about
your own life some more.

1101
00:51:16,682 --> 00:51:17,900
Hey.

1102
00:51:20,381 --> 00:51:21,426
Hey.

1103
00:51:22,862 --> 00:51:25,691
Emma... hello?

1104
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:30,087
Maybe part of your problem is
you don'’t even realize

1105
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:32,132
when a hot guy is trying
to get your attention.

1106
00:51:38,182 --> 00:51:40,140
Look, I know
we didn'’t really, um,

1107
00:51:40,184 --> 00:51:42,229
know each other
back then, but...

1108
00:51:42,795 --> 00:51:43,926
I...

1109
00:51:46,015 --> 00:51:47,365
I used to have a crush on you

1110
00:51:47,408 --> 00:51:50,455
back when you and Brandy
were together.

1111
00:51:50,498 --> 00:51:52,152
Rea-- No!

1112
00:51:52,196 --> 00:51:54,285
-Really?
-Mmm-hmm.

1113
00:51:54,328 --> 00:51:56,722
Oh, I'’m sorry, I--
I literally had no idea.

1114
00:51:56,765 --> 00:51:59,855
It'’s fine. You know,
I managed to survive
without you.

1115
00:51:59,899 --> 00:52:02,075
-Yeah.
-I lost my virginity
to Peter Grumbauer.

1116
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:05,557
-Sorry about that.
-No, it was great actually.

1117
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:08,821
Yeah, he read a lot of books
about female anatomy.

1118
00:52:08,864 --> 00:52:11,389
There you go.
You were probably better off.

1119
00:52:11,432 --> 00:52:13,434
My moves at the time
were quite basic.

1120
00:52:13,478 --> 00:52:16,307
-You know,
three pumps and done?
-Gross.

1121
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:19,223
I'’ve gotten better since then,
though... at sex.

1122
00:52:19,266 --> 00:52:21,094
-But not talking.
-[laughing]

1123
00:52:24,271 --> 00:52:27,100
You know, it'’s not that
I didn'’t ever notice you.

1124
00:52:28,493 --> 00:52:31,409
I'’d see you reading
or whatever, and...

1125
00:52:32,714 --> 00:52:36,196
Ugh, I don'’t know,
this is gonna sound corny,

1126
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:40,809
but... you had
a certain beauty
in your solitude.

1127
00:52:45,727 --> 00:52:47,207
Um...

1128
00:52:47,251 --> 00:52:50,428
you know,
try not to look
into this, but...

1129
00:52:50,471 --> 00:52:52,038
[chuckling]

1130
00:52:52,081 --> 00:52:55,955
...do you maybe wanna
get out of here?

1131
00:52:57,522 --> 00:52:59,263
Whoo! Yeah!

1132
00:52:59,306 --> 00:53:01,308
What is wrong with me?

1133
00:53:01,352 --> 00:53:03,963
No, no, no,
I thought she was gonna
knock over that tree.

1134
00:53:04,006 --> 00:53:05,617
With that bony ass?

1135
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:07,836
She has nowhere
the amount of force

1136
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,751
or weight necessary to move
that sort of mass.

1137
00:53:09,795 --> 00:53:11,536
Okay, no,
that was bad timing.

1138
00:53:11,579 --> 00:53:13,581
No, that was bad timing, it was
a half-second of distraction.

1139
00:53:13,625 --> 00:53:15,670
No, you know what?
Guys don'’t ever mature.

1140
00:53:15,714 --> 00:53:17,759
Like, look at my dad.

1141
00:53:17,803 --> 00:53:19,805
Just, all men are ruled
by their dicks.

1142
00:53:19,848 --> 00:53:21,850
They have one dick
driving the boat,

1143
00:53:21,894 --> 00:53:24,331
and then they have
all these thousands
of little dicks in their head,

1144
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:27,029
-just telling the big dick
where to go, so...
-Okay.

1145
00:53:27,073 --> 00:53:29,945
Can you not make this
more than it has to be?

1146
00:53:29,989 --> 00:53:31,295
What can I do?

1147
00:53:41,174 --> 00:53:43,437
You can hit on Brandy.
For real.

1148
00:53:44,351 --> 00:53:46,266
-No, I'’m serious.
-Come on.

1149
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:49,617
-Come on.
-No, I'’m serious.

1150
00:53:49,661 --> 00:53:52,185
You'’re a lady-killer,
right? Yeah.
And you'’re great at sex.

1151
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:55,841
And you two still have
some sort of chemistry going on,
and...

1152
00:53:55,884 --> 00:53:57,538
it'’ll be one last test.

1153
00:53:58,626 --> 00:53:59,975
Because if
she hooks up with you,

1154
00:54:00,019 --> 00:54:02,935
then she shows
her true colors, and I win.

1155
00:54:02,978 --> 00:54:07,287
But if she turns you down,
then I get to see you rejected,
and I still win, so...

1156
00:54:07,331 --> 00:54:08,723
it'’s a win-win for me.

1157
00:54:11,073 --> 00:54:12,901
And you'’d rather see me do that

1158
00:54:12,945 --> 00:54:15,426
than continue
whatever is going on here?

1159
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:19,865
Yeah.

1160
00:54:19,908 --> 00:54:21,954
-I really need to know.
-Really?

1161
00:54:27,176 --> 00:54:28,961
Fine.

1162
00:54:29,962 --> 00:54:32,225
Ah... by the way,

1163
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:33,835
nobody turns this down.

1164
00:54:33,879 --> 00:54:35,489
You'’re the worst.

1165
00:54:35,533 --> 00:54:36,969
Hey!

1166
00:54:37,012 --> 00:54:38,318
Oh!

1167
00:54:38,971 --> 00:54:40,102
[laughing]

1168
00:54:40,146 --> 00:54:42,148
[dance music playing]

1169
00:55:06,215 --> 00:55:08,392
Cover your dongs, gentlemen.

1170
00:55:11,482 --> 00:55:12,961
-[hollers]
-Open the door.

1171
00:55:13,005 --> 00:55:14,485
[Brandy]
What the...

1172
00:55:16,225 --> 00:55:17,836
What the hell are you doing?

1173
00:55:17,879 --> 00:55:21,013
What are you doing
in a bathroom stall with Josh?

1174
00:55:21,056 --> 00:55:22,841
We'’re having a smoke. Why?

1175
00:55:22,884 --> 00:55:25,147
What did you think
we were doing?

1176
00:55:29,935 --> 00:55:32,633
Wait a second, you thought
we were hooking up in there?

1177
00:55:34,461 --> 00:55:36,985
I can'’t believe that
you would think so low of me

1178
00:55:37,029 --> 00:55:39,727
that you think
I would cheat on your dad.

1179
00:55:39,771 --> 00:55:43,296
I would never cheat on your dad
because I care about him,
and I respect him.

1180
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,385
I would never jeopardize
what we have

1181
00:55:45,429 --> 00:55:48,693
by banging
the guy who didn'’t get
the Jeep commercial.

1182
00:55:48,736 --> 00:55:51,826
-Hey.
-Yeah, he'’s way hotter
than a guy in a Jeep ad.

1183
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:54,176
Yeah, thank you.

1184
00:55:56,048 --> 00:55:57,136
What?

1185
00:55:58,485 --> 00:56:00,487
Wait,

1186
00:56:00,531 --> 00:56:03,316
is he the reason
for all of this?

1187
00:56:04,665 --> 00:56:06,624
God, you don'’t even
remember, do you?

1188
00:56:06,667 --> 00:56:08,190
What?

1189
00:56:08,234 --> 00:56:10,845
I told you
that I had a crush on him.

1190
00:56:12,064 --> 00:56:15,415
I opened my fragile
teenage heart to you,

1191
00:56:15,459 --> 00:56:17,939
and instead
of being a good friend,

1192
00:56:17,983 --> 00:56:20,464
you yanked his crank
right in front of me.

1193
00:56:20,507 --> 00:56:22,030
I didn'’t think
it was a big deal.

1194
00:56:22,074 --> 00:56:23,902
I mean, you never said anything.

1195
00:56:23,945 --> 00:56:25,686
I was hurt.

1196
00:56:26,557 --> 00:56:27,862
Because you made me think that

00:56:27,906 --> 00:56:29,647
I wasn'’t good enough for him.

1198

Did you even notice
that you and I

1199
00:56:32,606 --> 00:56:34,434
stopped hanging out
completely after that?

1200
00:56:34,478 --> 00:56:35,957
It'’s just,
I thought you were busy

1201
00:56:36,001 --> 00:56:37,394

Whoa.

1204

Was I an insensitive
bitch to you?

1205
00:56:45,489 --> 00:56:47,099
Those are a few words for it.

1206
00:56:47,142 --> 00:56:49,144
Just a selfish, teen monster.

1207
00:56:50,189 --> 00:56:52,017
I'’ll allow it.

1208
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:54,715

1209
00:56:57,588 --> 00:56:59,024
Thank you.

1210

Emma, I really hope
that you can forgive me.

1211
00:57:05,857 --> 00:57:09,426
It was a long time ago,
so, maybe I can try.

1212
00:57:09,469 --> 00:57:12,037
Okay, because really,
like, there'’s no reason

1213
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:16,476
for us to be fighting
over this Riverdaleextra.

You'’re starting
to hurt my feelings.

We are two strong,
independent women.

1217
00:57:23,352 --> 00:57:24,832
We are-- are too smart

1218
00:57:24,876 --> 00:57:27,182
to let some guy come between us.

1219
00:57:27,226 --> 00:57:28,880
Yes, absolutely!

1220
00:57:28,923 --> 00:57:31,360
-Totally agree.
-Great.

1221
00:57:31,404 --> 00:57:33,145
So you'’ll stop seeing my dad?

1222
00:57:35,626 --> 00:57:38,237
I'’m sorry,
what did you just say to me?

1223

So you'’ll stop...
seeing my dad.

Wow!

00:57:47,942 --> 00:57:51,903
Cool, so you--
Nothing has changed, huh?

The same girl who spent
the entire week slut-shaming me

1230
00:58:02,391 --> 00:58:04,437
and calling me stupid.

1231
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:07,484
Do you know what'’s stupid?
Being mean-spirited

1232
00:58:07,527 --> 00:58:10,487
and trying to shut people out
who just want you to like them.

1233
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:12,619
And do you know what happens
to people like you?

1234
00:58:12,663 --> 00:58:14,621
They end up alone.

1235
00:58:14,665 --> 00:58:17,494
God, I have done nothing
but try to be kind to you,

1236
00:58:17,537 --> 00:58:19,365
and I'’ve taken
a ton of shit from you,

1237
00:58:19,408 --> 00:58:21,280
so guess what?

1238
00:58:21,323 --> 00:58:22,629
I am done!

1239
00:58:22,673 --> 00:58:24,892
I am done
trying to win you over.

1240
00:58:24,936 --> 00:58:27,634
In fact, no,
I am done with you, period.

1241
00:58:27,678 --> 00:58:31,725
Okay, well, I may have
taken things too far...

1242
00:58:31,769 --> 00:58:34,815
You know, I was never
competing with you
for your dad'’s attention,

1243
00:58:34,859 --> 00:58:38,036
but if you are psycho enough
to think that I'’m trying
to steal him away from you,

1244
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:40,255
then fine! Huh?

1245
00:58:40,299 --> 00:58:41,779
Maybe I'’ll do that!

1246
00:58:41,822 --> 00:58:43,868
Yeah! You know, we talked
about him retiring early

1247
00:58:43,911 --> 00:58:45,826
-and moving
to Los Angeles.
-What?

1248
00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:48,960
Mmm, the West Coast sounds
pretty fantastic
right about now.

1249

If you wanna go
to war with me...

1250
00:58:54,095 --> 00:58:57,011
-I will win.
-Okay, let'’s not get crazy--

1251

Oh, you haven'’t seen

So, what is happening exactly?

Well, I woke the sleeping giant,

1260
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,784
and the Sasquatch is coming
to destroy my life.

to twist my titties.

1266
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:43,667
Okay, is Josh there?

1267
00:59:44,972 --> 00:59:46,626
Mmm, yeah.

1268
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:47,932
Put him on.

1269
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:50,412
Hey.

She obviously can'’t drive home.

01:00:04,035 --> 01:00:08,517
-Yeah.
-Can you take care of her?

1275
01:00:08,561 --> 01:00:11,956
Help her sober up
before you put her in a car
so she doesn'’t go home drunk?

1276
01:00:11,999 --> 01:00:14,567
Uh, yeah.

with my friend,

of her in any way,

out of your wiener.

to the same finishing school?

we were truly happy again

You made
some good points last night.

There are a lot of reasons
why we don'’t work on paper.

And she might
leave me someday.

But that'’s a risk
I'’m willing to take

1512

so I can spend
another minute with her,

1513

if I can be a part of it.

-That'’s not what she's saying.
-That'’s exactly what I'm saying.

Brandy is, like,

She'’s trying
to destroy our family,

She'’s winning!

I saw my family break apart,

01:26:36,147 --> 01:26:38,236
I'’m more of a cheap beer
kind of girl.

1712
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:40,934
Okay.

1713
01:26:40,978 --> 01:26:44,024
-Trip to the liquor store.
Problem solved.
-Yeah.

1714
01:26:44,068 --> 01:26:46,418
I'’m not that crazy
about the shirts you gave me.

1715
01:26:46,462 --> 01:26:48,638
I'’m more of a blue
button-down kind of guy.

1716
01:26:48,681 --> 01:26:51,380
That'’s fine.
I wasn'’t trying to change you.

1717
01:26:51,423 --> 01:26:55,471
-I don'’t think
I wanna move to Los Angeles.
-Oh, okay.

1718
01:26:57,647 --> 01:27:00,476
-I think I might want kids.
-Mmm...

1719
01:27:00,519 --> 01:27:02,521
[over P.A.]
We can talk about that.

1720
01:27:03,827 --> 01:27:05,872
[Brandy]
I mean, I don'’t know for sure,

1721
01:27:05,916 --> 01:27:07,961
because I still sprint
to the drugstore
if the condom breaks,

1722
01:27:08,005 --> 01:27:09,136
for the Plan B pills.

1723
01:27:10,399 --> 01:27:14,794
Um, noted.
Better condoms.

1724
01:27:14,838 --> 01:27:16,405
Uh, I don'’t think
we'’re gonna have

1725
01:27:16,448 --> 01:27:18,145
to think about that
for a few years.

1726
01:27:18,189 --> 01:27:21,018
-And by then,
I'’ll be impotent.
-Important!

1727
01:27:21,061 --> 01:27:23,803
What is so
important about tonight,

1728
01:27:23,847 --> 01:27:26,241
[over P.A.]
uh, is the urgent cause

1729
01:27:26,284 --> 01:27:28,678
that we are
all here to address,

1730
01:27:28,721 --> 01:27:31,681
our city'’s homeless community.

1731
01:27:31,724 --> 01:27:33,639
So thank you all
for your donations,

1732
01:27:33,683 --> 01:27:35,119
-and why don'’t
you give yourselves...
-What?

1733
01:27:35,162 --> 01:27:36,816
...another round
of applause for that?

1734
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:38,688
[applause]

1735
01:27:40,777 --> 01:27:43,997
-I would also like
to thank Brandy...
-[mouthing] What?

1736
01:27:44,041 --> 01:27:47,087
...for being
a true force
of nature.

1737
01:27:47,131 --> 01:27:50,090
You all heard
what she feels about me.

1738
01:27:50,134 --> 01:27:52,397
I mean, don'’t get me wrong,
she, uh,

1739
01:27:52,441 --> 01:27:55,270
really got under my skin.

1740
01:27:55,313 --> 01:27:58,882
I mean, sometimes
you just wanna strangle her

1741
01:27:58,925 --> 01:28:00,579
until the breath
leaves her body.

1742
01:28:00,623 --> 01:28:02,799
[woman]
Oh, that'’s the human
lump of pus!

1743
01:28:02,842 --> 01:28:05,497
[laughter]

1744
01:28:05,541 --> 01:28:10,110
But, I mean,
you have to respect someone
who means what she says,

1745
01:28:10,154 --> 01:28:14,506
means well,
and makes the people
that I love happy.

1746
01:28:16,247 --> 01:28:17,640
And I think,
maybe in another life,

1747
01:28:17,683 --> 01:28:19,772
we might'’ve been friends.

1748
01:28:21,861 --> 01:28:25,430
Uh, '’cause that's
what life'’s about, right?

1749
01:28:25,474 --> 01:28:28,303
People and connection.

1750
01:28:29,565 --> 01:28:32,176
I know it'’s getting
close to midnight, so,

1751
01:28:32,219 --> 01:28:34,265
why don'’t we put
the past behind us

1752
01:28:34,309 --> 01:28:36,833
and say hello to the future?

1753
01:28:37,790 --> 01:28:39,836
-Happy New Year!
-[all] Ten, nine...

1754
01:28:39,879 --> 01:28:41,881
So we have a lot
of obstacles to overcome.

1755
01:28:41,925 --> 01:28:43,883
-...six, five...
-We do.

1756
01:28:43,927 --> 01:28:47,670
...four, three, two, one!

1757
01:28:47,713 --> 01:28:52,022
-Happy New Year!
-[all cheering]

1758
01:29:03,294 --> 01:29:05,992
[soft music]

1759
01:29:20,311 --> 01:29:22,139
[distant car horn honking]

1760
01:29:27,274 --> 01:29:28,711
[car door closing]

1761
01:29:49,819 --> 01:29:53,518
-Still drive that thing?
-Yeah.

1762
01:29:54,563 --> 01:29:56,478
If it ain'’t broke,
why fix it?

1763
01:30:00,656 --> 01:30:04,355
So, what'’re you doing here?
I saw you leaving the bar.

1764
01:30:05,704 --> 01:30:07,402
I realized you--

1765
01:30:07,445 --> 01:30:09,404
you left something
at my place.

1766
01:30:10,317 --> 01:30:12,276
Mmm, no, I don'’t think so.

1767
01:30:12,319 --> 01:30:14,321
Yeah, yeah, you did.

1768
01:30:14,365 --> 01:30:16,019
Pretty sure I didn'’t.

1769
01:30:17,063 --> 01:30:19,152
[chuckling]
Then what'’s this?

1770
01:30:19,762 --> 01:30:23,330
Your hairless cat?

1771
01:30:23,374 --> 01:30:24,419
Right.Yeah.

1772
01:30:24,462 --> 01:30:26,072
Thank you.And...

1773
01:30:26,116 --> 01:30:28,640
Mmm-hmm?Your Fabergé egg.

1774
01:30:28,684 --> 01:30:30,512
I was wondering
where that went.

1775
01:30:30,555 --> 01:30:34,516
Thank you.Yes, and...

1776
01:30:34,559 --> 01:30:36,474
a limited edition
Goblet of Fire.

1777
01:30:36,518 --> 01:30:38,258
Oh, wow.Yeah.

1778
01:30:38,302 --> 01:30:40,043
-Thank you.
-Yeah, you'’re welcome.

1779
01:30:40,086 --> 01:30:42,175
You'’re so weird.
[chuckling]

1780
01:30:42,219 --> 01:30:44,830
You know, I needed these
before I leave.

1781
01:30:44,874 --> 01:30:48,834
Yeah.
Africa, huh?

1782
01:30:48,878 --> 01:30:50,749
Yeah.Whoa.

1783
01:30:51,794 --> 01:30:55,014
-That feels sudden.
-Yeah.

1784
01:30:55,058 --> 01:30:57,016
Sometimes you just
need a change.

1785
01:30:58,017 --> 01:30:59,323
Yeah.

1786
01:31:00,585 --> 01:31:01,891
You know,

1787
01:31:01,934 --> 01:31:04,981
I'’ve always wanted
to go to Africa.

1788
01:31:05,024 --> 01:31:08,550
Shoot giraffes.
Pictures, photos, yeah.

1789
01:31:08,593 --> 01:31:10,290
Thank you for clarifying.

1790
01:31:11,378 --> 01:31:13,250
How about you take me with you?

1791
01:31:14,164 --> 01:31:15,687
You serious?

1792
01:31:18,081 --> 01:31:20,779
Yeah... I am.

1793
01:31:24,174 --> 01:31:27,220
Now that sounds like
a true crime murder mystery.

1794
01:31:27,264 --> 01:31:30,572
-We both go on a safari,
but only one of us comes back?
-Mmm-hmm.

1795
01:31:30,615 --> 01:31:34,314
Just to be clear,
I would be the murderer,
and you would be the "murderee,"

1796
01:31:34,358 --> 01:31:36,534
because I know
37 different ways that
you can poison someone

1797
01:31:36,578 --> 01:31:38,144
without leaving a trace.

1798

[car horn honking]

1799
01:31:49,155 --> 01:31:51,070
Babe, watch this.

1800
01:31:53,812 --> 01:31:56,119
Hey, kid,
you'’re blocking the driveway.

1801
01:31:56,162 --> 01:31:58,034
Dad.

1802
01:31:58,077 --> 01:32:00,384
You break my daughter'’s heart,
and I'’ll kill ya.

1803
01:32:00,427 --> 01:32:03,518
Hey, leave them alone.
He wants to kiss her.

1804
01:32:04,519 --> 01:32:06,390
God, you ruin everything.

1805
01:32:08,305 --> 01:32:10,568
[Josh]
Actually, you ruin everything.

1806
01:32:10,612 --> 01:32:13,919
