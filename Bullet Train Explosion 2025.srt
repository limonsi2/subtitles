AOMORI BRANCH OFFICE

3
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:18,500
This is a passenger car.

4
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:19,958
Please make your way to the back.

5
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:22,250
Welcome to the Aomori
Shinkansen Stock Center.

6
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:22,958
Wow!

7
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:23,666
Cool!

8
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,333
-This is where we temporarily park
-This way.

9
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:27,666
-The Tohoku-shinkansen train cars.
-Wow.

10
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:30,583
-So nice.
-When the Shinkansen opened between

11
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:33,375
-Tokyo and Osaka in nineteen sixty-four,
-This is crazy!

12
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:34,291
It was

13
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:36,291
the fastest train in the world

14
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:38,125
and was called the Dream Super Express.

15
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:42,166
This E-Five series Shinkansen travels
at a maximum speed of 320 kilometers per

16
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,291
-hour.
-Some parts are made of aluminum alloy,

17
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:45,916
and the axles are hollow in
order to help reduce weight.

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,041
It's the newest model that connects
Tokyo and Shin-Hakodate-Hokuto in four

19
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:50,291
-hours.
-It may not seem like it,

20
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:51,916
but this is a coupling mechanism.

21
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:53,916
Oooh! Whoa!

22
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,208
You'll be boarding a train car
just like this one later.

23
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:00,125
Okay everyone, please watch your step.

24
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:01,166
Alright.

25
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:04,208
Does anyone have any questions
for Mister Takaichi?

26
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:05,708
This way, please.

27
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:08,291
So, what made you,, uh…

28
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:10,125
wanna become a train conductor?

29
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:11,750
Why not a train driver?

30
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,000
-Good question.
-Yeah.

31
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:16,458
Many different types of people
ride the Shinkansen.

32
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:18,208
There are always

33
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:20,541
a lot of students in school trips,
like you.

34
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:22,916
And then those students might

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,666
come along a few years later and

36
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,833
board the Shinkansen to go
watch their best friend get married.

37
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:29,166
He's talking about me, y'know?

38
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,000
-Definitely!
-One passenger might be going

39
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,541
on a family trip, while another

40
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:34,375
is coming back from a business one.

41
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:36,583
Strangers to each other,

42
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,666
boarding the train for different purposes,

43
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,833
yet all of them heading
in the same direction.

44
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:44,583
Once they arrive,
they're back to being strangers.

45
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,625
There is something nice about the way

46
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,291
it feels to watch all that.

47
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:52,250
I don't really get it but
it sounds kinda deep.

48
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:55,458
Let's get a group photo in
front of the Shinkansen.

49
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:56,083
Here, here.

50
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,291
-Okay, gather up over here.
-Okay.

51
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:01,541
-"Cheese!"
-Ready? Say, "Cheese!"

53
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:18,458
Mister Takaichi.

54
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:19,458
How's it going?

55
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:20,208
Hi.

56
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,125
-I'll be joining you today.
-Great.

57
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:23,500
Should be easy.

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,500
How was the student tour earlier?

59
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:28,208
Kids don't wanna hear what an
old man like me has to say.

60
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,125
I'm a young guy, why not have me do it?

61
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,166
"My mission is to deliver

62
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:33,666
each

63
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,541
and every one of my passengers

64
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,125
safely to their destination every day."

65
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,041
Right?

66
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,125
That's not something you
should make light of.

67
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,875
This is a serious job, you know.

68
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,083
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:48,583
But you know,

70
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,125
-I agree with you, actually.
-What?

71
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:54,750
I'll talk to the district
manager about you, Fujii.

72
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:58,791
-Thank you so much!
-But you know I don't call the shots,

73
00:03:58,875 --> 00:03:59,708
right?

74
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:05,041
This train will stop at Ninohe,

Please wait behind the safety barrier

-Thank you for your cooperation.
-No, come on.

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,958
Everyone's really tuned in on the
subject right now because of the crazy

107
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,625
energy prices. It's a great

Headache?

144
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,041
Let's get an ambulance there,
just in case.

145
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,166
How long to Morioka?

"Oh, dang it, we're gonna miss
it, dude! Run! Let's go already."

161
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:43,833
-"Go, go, go, go!"
-Excuse me! We're getting on, man! Wait!

162
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,375
-We're coming, we're coming!
-Please stand clear of the closing doors.

163
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:46,125
We're coming, wait a sec!

164
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,333
Hurry up, man, come on!

165
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,041
Departing Shin-Aomori Station
at three seventeen p.m.

166
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,250
Time, check.

167
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,833
Boarding, check.

168
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,375
-Please stand clear of the closing doors.
-Closing doors.

169
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:07,500
Doors are closing.

170
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:12,625
Side lights, off.

171
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,166
Signal clear.

172
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,041
Time check,

173
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:16,333
done.

174
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:17,541
Doors

175
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:17,833
closed.

176
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:18,833
Brakes

177
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,125
released.

178
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:25,291
The safety barrier gates are closing.
Please stand clear of the closing gates.

179
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,541
-Bye bye!
-"Bye, train!"

180
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:51,333
"Bye bye train!"

181
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,958
-Bye bye!
-Bye bye!

182
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:58,416
Okay.

183
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,875
On time.

184
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:08,000
Fifty sixty B has departed on time.

185
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:10,916
Good morning.

186
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And thank you for traveling
with JR East today.

187
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,791
This is the Hayabusa Number Sixty,
bound for Tokyo.

188
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:22,208
This train is scheduled to
make the following stops:

189
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:24,916
-Hachinohe,
-I'm a big fan, can I

190
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,333
-three forty-one p.m.
-have your autograph?

191
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:27,250
Oh.

192
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,458
-Morioka,
-Sure, yeah.

193
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:29,625
Four eleven p.m.

194
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:31,208
Sendai,

195
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,250
four fifty-six p.m.

196
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:34,791
Omiya,

197
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,208
six-oh-seven p.m.

198
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,166
-Ueno,
-"It gets on your fingers."

199
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,416
-"Yeah, I know, right?"
-six twenty-six p.m.

200
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,375
We will arrive at our destination,

201
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,083
Tokyo Station, at six
thirty-two p.m. Thank you.

202
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:47,000
-Bummed there were no bears.
-Yeah, man. No bears at all.

203
00:09:58,541 --> 00:09:59,375
TOKYO

204
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:07,916
EAST JAPAN RAILWAY COMPANY
HEADQUARTERS BUILDING

205
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,708
Good morning, and thank you
for calling JR East Call Center.

206
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,000
If it's a matter of articulation, we can
definitely make sure to train them better

207
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,416
-so it doesn't happen next time, yes.
-My name is Noguchi how can I help you.

208
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,208
We apologize for the inconvenience,
and "thank you so much for calling."

209
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,166
Hello there and good morning.

210
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,083
Thank you for calling
the JR East Call Center.

211
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,750
"Thank you so much for bringing this to
our attention, ma'am. We really appreciate

212
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,000
-it."
-I'm Miyashita, how can I help you today?

213
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,000
There's a bomb

214
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,708
on the Hayabusa Number Sixty

215
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,291
going to Tokyo.

216
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:29,458
Sir, I'm sorry but…

217
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:32,375
would you mind repeating that from
the beginning, if that's okay?

218
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:35,625
The bomb will go off if the train's speed
drops below one hundred kilometers

219
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:36,583
per hour.

220
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,083
To show this is real,

221
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:39,958
the same type of bomb

222
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,166
was planted

223
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,375
on Freight train twenty seventy-four
of the Aoemori Railway Line.

224
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:45,458
What's wrong?

225
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:48,958
That one is set to go off if the speed
drops below five kilometers per hour.

226
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:49,875
A bomb?

227
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:50,958
-He hung up, sir.
-W-Wait.

228
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:51,875
He did?

229
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,250
I PLANTED A BOMB.

230
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:58,250
AOMORI-HIGASHI STATION,
AOEMORI RAILWAY LINE

231
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:01,083
Hi.

232
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:02,541
Aomori-Higashi Station.

233
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:03,958
Huh?

234
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:05,375
A bomb?

235
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:06,375
What?

236
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,416
Is it a prank?

237
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,416
Wait, huh…

238
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,583
The speed's not dropping below
five kilometers per hour so--

239
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:25,666
Do the cops and the feds know yet?

240
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,625
They do, sir.

241
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:27,791
A joint HQ

242
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,416
is being set up at the TMPD.

243
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,416
We're sending people there immediately.

244
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:37,083
JR EAST SHINKANSEN
GENERAL MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT

245
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,833
Just like the bomber said.

246
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,083
As soon as the speed dropped below five,

247
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:43,958
it exploded.

248
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,166
Exactly like the one-oh-nine case.

249
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,416
Call the Control Center.

250
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,250
Yes, sir.

251
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,166
Under a certain speed, a

252
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:53,750
bomb goes off?

253
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:55,666
If this is true,

254
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,333
then the Hayabusa Number Sixty will
have no choice but to keep running.

255
00:11:58,416 --> 00:11:59,458
Where is it now?

256
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:00,583
How fast is it going?

257
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:04,375
It's about to reach Shichinohe-Towada at
two hundred and fifty-seven kilometers

258
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:05,000
per hour.

259
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,625
Tell them to keep their
speed above one hundred.

260
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:08,750
I'm heading over there right now,

261
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,875
but you can handle any minor
decisions until I get there.

262
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:11,875
Yes, sir.

263
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:16,083
The was the General Manager,
you heard what he said, right?

264
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,250
Fifty sixty B is going
to turn the ATC off,

265
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:21,166
and go through Hachinohe at one hundred
and twenty kilometers per hour.

266
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,291
It shouldn't go too fast.

267
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,708
We have to buy time,
prepare ourselves for the worst.

268
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:27,375
All Hokkaido and Tohoku shinkansen
services are suspended.

269
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,333
Hokuriku and Joetsu lines
will turn back at Omiya.

270
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:32,833
Evacuate all trains now.

271
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:33,958
All trains, sir?

272
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,000
We need to clear the tracks
for Fifty sixty B.

273
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,333
Yoshimura told me to handle
minor decisions for now.

274
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:39,875
-That's not a, uh…
-"Minor"?

275
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,750
Nothing's more important than
the safety of our passengers.

276
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:42,666
Now go!

277
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,750
Yes, sir!

278
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,333
"Thirty ten B…"

279
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:57,416
SHICHINOHE TOWN, KAMIKITA COUNTY,
AOMORI PREFECTURE 633 KM TO TOKYO.

280
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,125
Fifty sixty B,
this is Transport Dispatcher, Nagano.

281
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,750
Yes. This is Matsumoto,
fifty sixty B's driver.

282
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,958
Stay calm and listen carefully.

283
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:12,750
A few minutes ago,

284
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:16,166
we got a call from an anonymous individual
who said they planted a bomb on

285
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,083
the Hayabusa sixty.

286
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:18,333
What?

287
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:19,958
Uhh- This is…

288
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:21,791
some kind of… drill, right?

289
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,500
This is not a drill.

290
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:25,916
Okay, copy that.

291
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,291
We'll inspect the train
once we stop at Hachinohe.

292
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,125
He said it'll go off

293
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,500
if the train's speed drops bellow
one hundred kilometers per hour.

294
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,833
So I can't stop the train?

295
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,041
They didn't find anything
during the inspection.

296
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,333
Are you sure it's not a prank?

297
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,416
I'll have to stop at
Tokyo Station no matter what--

298
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,750
This is Kasagi,
Commander of the Control Center.

299
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,708
Listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

300
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:45,958
Please disable the ATC,

301
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:49,291
maintain a speed of 120 kilometers
per hour and pass through Hachinohe.

302
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,250
We're doing everything we can to fix this.

303
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:56,958
Okay, sir. Copy that.

304
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:06,750
ATC

305
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:08,041
is off.

306
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,041
ATC DISABLED

307
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,000
It's off.

308
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,083
Check.

309
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:14,083
The ATC is off.

310
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:15,333
Check.

311
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:38,875
Since the freight train exploded,

312
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:42,875
they probably weren't lying about the
bomb on the Fifty sixty B either.

313
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,708
And so what should I tell the passengers?

314
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:49,125
Tell the passengers you're unable to stop
at Hachinohe due to technical issues.

315
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:49,750
So then…

316
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:51,916
nothing about the bomb?

317
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:54,625
Do not disclose that.

318
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:56,958
We need to make sure no one panics.

319
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:03,375
OIRASE TOWN, KAMIKITA COUNTY,
AOMORI PREFECTURE 612 KM TO TOKYO

320
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:04,333
Oh hi, how are ya?

321
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,500
You got ice cream?

322
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:06,625
Absolutely, sir.

323
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:07,583
-Ice cream, coming right up, ok?
-"That one's so good, right?"

324
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:08,250
Also…

325
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,291
Can I

326
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:10,583
-have your Instagram?
-He actually asked her!

327
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:11,625
Sir, I'm afraid this

328
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,458
is not compatible with Instagram.

329
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:17,916
-Rejected!
-Wasn't gonna happen, Takei!

330
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,583
Takei's just trying
to get Aoi's attention!

331
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,291
-"Please, stop it."
-Stop it, that's gross.

332
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:22,250
He is, right?

333
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,333
That's what I thought, too.

334
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:24,416
Right, Yuzuki?

335
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:25,875
Huh?

336
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,375
What were you saying?

337
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:28,333
Wait, you didn't know?

338
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,125
Takei told Aoi he liked her.

339
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:31,250
What! Really?

340
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,541
So he just got a rejection,

341
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:33,708
and he's trying to pretend

342
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,708
-like everything's fine.
-like everything's fine.

343
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:36,666
I can hear you.

344
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,416
-And you know you're wrong.
-Come on, shut up and

345
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,333
get out of here, gosh!

346
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:41,750
-Sit down, Takei.
-She's so cruel!

347
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,291
Yeah, just give up already!

348
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,250
Come on, don't let it get to you, Aoi.

349
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,083
He really said that? That's crazy!

350
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,708
Can I have your attention, please.

351
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,833
-We are now approaching Hachinohe Station.
-"You think you hurt his feelings?"

352
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:56,041
However, due to technical
difficulties, this train will not be

353
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:59,375
-stopping at Hachinohe Station.
-"I hope I did, because he's a jerk."

354
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,250
We apologize to all passengers

355
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,291
who were affected by this change,

356
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,500
I will now repeat this announcement.

357
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:06,833
Due to

358
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,416
technical difficulties,

359
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,666
this train will not be stopping
at Hachinohe Station, thank you.

360
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,416
Uh--

361
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,416
Do you think something's wrong?

362
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,333
Well…

363
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,916
as long as it stops in Morioka,
it should be fine, right?

364
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:26,583
Here it is.

365
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,416
Okay, let's go one by one.

366
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,083
Okay.

367
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,333
Twenty thirty B is at
Kitakami, track one, going southbound.

368
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,625
Twenty thirty B,
passengers getting off at Kitakami.

369
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,291
Thirty twenty-five B is
already at Morioka's Stock Center.

370
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:36,208
Okay.

371
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,250
Next. Sixty-six B for
Sendai, track one, northbound.

372
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,125
Okay, tell Sixty-six B's driver
to stop at Mizusawaesashi Station.

373
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,125
-I'll take Omiya-dai.
-Okay.

374
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:46,666
Got it. Next, fifty-one fifty-two B,
Ichinoseki. Track one, southbound.

375
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,708
Fifty-one fifty-two B, the
passengers got off at Ichinoseki Station.

376
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:50,500
Ichinoseki. Got it.

377
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:53,541
Lastly, ninety-one sixty-six B,
Furukawa. Track one. Southbound.

378
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,166
All routes to Sendai have been cleared.

379
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,875
-Ninety-one sixty-six B, clear to arrive.
-Alright. Where's fifty sixty B?

380
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:57,833
Got it.

381
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,250
-The TMPD is here.
-It's--

382
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:08,958
Kawagoe, Special Investigation Team.

383
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,000
Yoshimura, General Manager, JR East.

384
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,375
Kasagi, Commander of the Control Center.

385
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,041
I heard about the case.

386
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,666
-Is the bomber calling here?
-Yes.

387
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,916
All of his calls will be forwarded
to our first line here.

388
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,500
Fifty sixty B is almost at Hachinohe.

389
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,875
Can you check their ATC again?

390
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,000
They won't be stopping.

391
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,041
-Okay.
-ATC?

392
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,125
Automatic Train Control system.

393
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:31,250
All Shinkansen trains are
equipped with a system that

394
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:34,041
slows them down automatically
if they exceed the speed limit.

395
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,208
The speed limit at most stations

396
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:38,250
is Seventy Five Kilometers per hour.

397
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,083
So the system's off?

398
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,083
Yes, of course.

399
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,375
Unless it doesn't work properly.

400
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,250
Fifty sixty B just left
the Takadate Tunnel.

401
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,250
It's three kilometers away
from Hachinohe Station.

402
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:00,541
The ATC is off.

403
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,083
Check.

404
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:11,333
HACHINOHE CITY,
AOMORI PREFECTURE 595 KM TO TOKYO

405
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,125
-Your attention, please.
-That way. Towards the

406
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,375
The Hayabusa Number Sixty train bound
for Tokyo will not be stopping at

407
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:18,458
ticket gates, please.

408
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,083
-Hachinohe Station today.
-"If you could please head

409
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,083
towards the ticket gates."

410
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,916
Passengers booked on this train should
return to the ticket gates.

411
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,291
Your attention, please.

412
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:27,958
The Hayabusa Number Sixty
train bound for Tokyo,

413
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,458
will not be stopping at
Hachinohe Station today.

414
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,291
Honey, they're not stopping.

415
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,875
-I wonder why they're not braking.
-Get out of the way!

416
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:37,500
Ha?

417
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,791
Are you okay?

418
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,333
Fifty sixty B just passed
through Hachinohe.

419
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:00,458
The ATC did not engage.

420
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:05,791
Incoming call.

421
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:07,416
Incoming call,

422
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,250
line one.

423
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,500
This is Yoshimura, JR East.

424
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:18,750
So if you're willing to
pay a deactivation fee,

425
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:22,166
I'll tell you how to defuse the
bomb on the Hayabusa sixty.

426
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,916
The fee is one hundred billion yen.

427
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,916
What?

428
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:27,625
One hundred billion?

429
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:29,875
There's no way we can

430
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,791
get that kinda money on such short notice.

431
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:33,500
I don't want JR to pay it,

432
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,083
I want the citizens of Japan to pay it.

433
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,083
-Come on, the citizens of--?
-Hello?

434
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,291
Divide that amount
among everyone in Japan,

435
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:41,250
-Yes.
-Already?

436
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:43,041
-It's a thousand yen a person.
-Can you have them wait?

437
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,250
You can figure out how
to collect the money.

438
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:48,208
Only rule is one hundred billion
yen from the people of Japan.

439
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:49,208
That's it.

440
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,625
This goes far beyond
what we can deal with.

441
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,041
At this scale,
the government should get involved.

442
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:04,208
We do not negotiate with terrorists!

443
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,333
My name is Sasaki,
Special Advisor to the Prime Minister.

444
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,458
-I'm JR East's…
-No need for introductions,

445
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,500
Shinnosuke Yoshimura, General Manager.

446
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:19,208
This case needs to be handled
within a very short time frame,

447
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:20,291
I'm sure you know that.

448
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:21,916
Lieutenant Kawagoe,

449
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,708
I saw you there.

450
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,083
Yoshimura. Let's get right to it.

451
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:29,416
I want you to warn the
passengers about the bomb on the train.

452
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,208
What?

453
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,833
But, if the passengers hear about what's
going on, things could get out of control.

454
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:33,958
Of course I know that,

455
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,833
Control Center Commander, Yuichi Kasagi.

456
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:38,000
At this speed, the train will reach Tokyo

457
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,041
in five and a half hours.

458
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,000
We need to let everyone
know so we increase

459
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,041
our chances of finding out who's doing it.

460
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:43,958
Oh and by the way,

461
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,375
this is a government decision, am I clear?

462
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,625
NINOHE CITY,
IWATE PREFECTURE 573 KM TO TOKYO

463
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:55,458
Okay, I undestand.

464
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:57,708
Thank you.

465
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:02,750
They want us

466
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,041
to tell them everything?

467
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,375
But everyone will panic.

468
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:10,375
There's no way.

469
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,750
Sure, easy for them to say when
they're not the ones in danger like w--

470
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,375
-Fujii,
-stop!

471
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,791
Look I'm scared too, okay?

472
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,500
But the worst thing that can happen

473
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,375
is for any of us to panic right now.

474
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,291
Can I have your attention, please.

475
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,291
According to the latest information,

476
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:40,208
there's a security threat
on the Hayabusa Sixty.

477
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,875
An explosive device has
been placed on the train.

478
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:48,333
According to the latest information,
there's a security threat on the Hayabusa

479
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,916
Sixty. An explosive device
has been placed on the train.

480
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,833
Everyone shut up!

481
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,166
-Oh no.
-This device is set to detonate

482
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,416
-An explosive device? What?
-if the train's speed ever drops

483
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,500
-below a certain threshold.
-Are you kidding?! this is crazy!

484
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,875
Since we were unable
to confirm our safety,

485
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:02,625
we passed through Hachinohe Station.

486
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,666
-What happened?
-The police are

487
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,791
It's okay, it's okay.

488
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,333
Currently investigating to
try and resolve the situation.

489
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:08,541
-We should do something.
-Go find out what's happening!

490
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:09,750
Is this train going to… explode?

491
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:12,916
-JR East is working closely with them.
-They're talking about explosions.

492
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Panic in a crowded train car can
become extremely dangerous.

493
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:18,000
To ensure everyone's safety,

494
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,625
we ask that all passengers

495
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:22,041
stay calm and follow the instructions

496
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:22,875
of the crew.

497
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,291
I repeat.

498
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,458
-An explosive device has been planted
-It has to be a prank or something.

499
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:28,708
On this Hayabusa Number Sixty train.

500
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,625
Didn't you guys

501
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:34,708
check this train before
leaving the station?

502
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:37,291
-Or am I crazy?
-Yes-No--

503
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:40,041
We conduct safety inspections
before every departure.

504
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,208
However, if

505
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:43,291
it was planted after the inspection,

506
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:44,541
it would be hard to detect.

507
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:47,000
-Is that so?
-What? Why? That makes no sense at all!

508
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:49,041
I think you just didn't do your job well.

509
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:51,583
-We're sorry for the inconvenience.
-You're kidding, right?

510
00:22:51,666 --> 00:22:53,500
It's like you don't care
about your passengers at all.

511
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:55,750
He's right! I've got places to be, man!

512
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,541
-Things to do!
-I think

513
00:22:57,625 --> 00:23:00,708
this could be a good way to shift
the focus off the scandal.

514
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:02,666
Again, we're sorry for the inconvenience.

515
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,875
-Yes, we completely apologize.
-We're very sorry.

516
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:04,833
Listen up, everyone!

517
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:06,625
Listen up!

518
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:09,916
Let's all calm down a bit, shall we?

519
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:13,708
The real bad guy

520
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:15,666
is the criminal who did this, right?

521
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:18,791
There's no use in venting about
it to our conductor here, am I--

522
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:20,416
-Hey!
-Sir, please!

523
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:22,208
I'm not venting here at all.

524
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:23,583
I'm actually

525
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:25,500
doing them a favor right now.

526
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,708
I'm helping them do a better job.

527
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:34,791
Back the hell off, Sugar Mama!

528
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:37,416
That's right! Who do you think you are,
Sugar Mama? You tell her!

529
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,333
Yeah, you slut!

530
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,125
What, are you so stupid that

531
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:43,416
you can't see how panicking will just

532
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,958
-make everyone around you
-"Miss Kagami."

533
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:46,541
-Calm down,
-panic as well, you piece of shit?

534
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:47,041
Calm down.

535
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:48,625
-Don't you!
-"Piece of shit"?

536
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:49,458
-Please calm down!
-"That's right!"

537
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:50,166
-Get off me!
-"Oh, shit."

538
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:50,916
Whoa!

539
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,958
-What the hell are you doing!
-Fujii!

540
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:52,708
Calm down!

541
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:54,250
Calm down now!

542
00:23:57,416 --> 00:23:58,541
-"S--"
-You don't have to

543
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:00,166
protect someone like her.

544
00:24:04,416 --> 00:24:05,333
Every passenger

545
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:07,291
is equally important to me.

546
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:11,291
It's my job to ensure the safety
of every single passenger.

547
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:12,708
So please…

548
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:14,333
-if you could all return to your seats.
-What the hell, man!

549
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:15,291
Please!

550
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:18,083
I promise I'll let you
know if I hear anything.

551
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,000
Please!

552
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,125
Sir, please.

553
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,333
Excuse me. Please.

554
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:22,916
That way.

555
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,041
Back to your seats.

556
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:31,958
You handled that very well,
Mister Takaichi.

557
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:34,500
If you need anything, just let me know.

558
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:36,125
I'm in car number nine.

559
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:39,958
YUKO KAGAMI TOWARDS A THOUGHTFUL
AND KINDER SOCIETY I AM YOUR REFLECTION.

560
00:24:45,791 --> 00:24:46,708
Thank you.

561
00:24:54,416 --> 00:24:56,125
We're now interrupting our regular program

562
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:58,000
to bring you live coverage
of Chief Cabinet

563
00:24:58,083 --> 00:24:59,666
Secretary Suwa's press briefing.

564
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:04,291
Uh…

565
00:25:04,958 --> 00:25:06,791
At around three twenty-five p.m. today,

566
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:08,958
JR East received news that

567
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:10,875
the Hayabusa number sixty

568
00:25:11,958 --> 00:25:14,083
was under serious threat after a,

569
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:15,958
bomb had been planted on the train.

570
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:18,250
In line with the

571
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:19,875
Japanese government's

572
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:21,333
fundamental policy

573
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:23,625
of not negotiating with terrorists,

574
00:25:23,708 --> 00:25:25,916
we are focused on apprehending
the perpetrator,

575
00:25:26,416 --> 00:25:27,500
all while making

576
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:29,333
passenger safety our top priority.

577
00:25:30,416 --> 00:25:33,416
The Prime Minister,
who is in the U.S. on an official visit,

578
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,666
was immediately briefed on the matter.

579
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:37,208
He has ordered us

580
00:25:37,291 --> 00:25:40,083
to keep the public informed
with timely and precise updates.

581
00:25:40,166 --> 00:25:41,375
Incoming call, line one.

582
00:25:45,291 --> 00:25:46,208
This is Yoshimura.

583
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:49,041
Why didn't you mention
the hundred billion yen?

584
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:52,125
You shouldn't waste your time,
you should let the people

585
00:25:52,208 --> 00:25:53,458
know as soon as possible.

586
00:25:53,541 --> 00:25:55,375
-The Hayabusa Number Sixty--
-This is the Special

587
00:25:55,458 --> 00:25:56,791
Advisor to the Prime Minister.

588
00:25:56,875 --> 00:25:58,000
I'm sure you're aware

589
00:25:58,666 --> 00:26:00,958
that we have no precedent
for anything like this.

590
00:26:01,041 --> 00:26:03,875
We have no framework in place to
collect funds from every citizen.

591
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:05,750
We have no legal basis for it either.

592
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:07,333
The Legislation Bureau's…

593
00:26:08,291 --> 00:26:09,125
Oh.

594
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:11,041
Could you trace it?

595
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,375
The Prime Minister

596
00:26:15,458 --> 00:26:17,750
-was immediately briefed on the matter.
-What? Uh…

597
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,000
-We are investigating
-"Framework", right.

598
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:22,708
Along with the local governments
and police departments

599
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:25,500
to quickly understand the
full scope of this case

600
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:26,458
and to provide--

601
00:26:27,875 --> 00:26:31,333
The bomb on the Shinkansen Hayabusa Number
Sixty will detonate if its speed

602
00:26:31,416 --> 00:26:33,583
drops below one hundred
kilometers per hour.

603
00:26:34,666 --> 00:26:36,791
The deactivation fee is
a hundred billion yen.

604
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:39,583
The bomb will detonate if the
speed drops below one hundred.

605
00:26:40,083 --> 00:26:42,666
The deactivation fee is
a hundred billion yen.

606
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,041
The bomb will detonate if the
speed drops below one hundred.

607
00:26:45,125 --> 00:26:45,958
Whoa!

608
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:47,125
-What the hell?
-The deactivation fee is

609
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:48,125
one hundred billion yen.

610
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:50,333
-What?
-"What's going on?"

611
00:26:50,416 --> 00:26:51,125
What?

612
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:53,541
The deactivation fee is
one hundred billion yen.

613
00:26:54,041 --> 00:26:57,125
The bomb will detonate if the
speed drops below one hundred.

614
00:26:57,208 --> 00:26:57,916
-Huh?
-The deactivation fee is

615
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,125
one hundred billion yen.

616
00:26:59,208 --> 00:27:02,208
The bomb will detonate if the
speed drops below one hundred.

617
00:27:02,291 --> 00:27:04,666
The deactivation fee is
one hundred billion yen.

618
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,666
The bomb will detonate if the
speed drops below one hundred.

619
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,083
The deactivation fee is
one hundred billion yen.

620
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:13,125
-That's Aomori's Stock Center.
-Yes. No mistaking it.

621
00:27:13,208 --> 00:27:14,375
The deactivation fee is
one hundred billion yen.

622
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:15,666
-Check the servers,
-Find the account

623
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,833
-and analyze the video.
-The bomb will detonate if the

624
00:27:16,916 --> 00:27:17,958
-speed drops below one hundred.
-Why is the file

625
00:27:18,041 --> 00:27:19,083
for the one-oh-nine case in
the seventies taking so long?

626
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:20,125
The deactivation fee is
one hundred billion yen.

627
00:27:20,208 --> 00:27:21,291
I'm on it!

628
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:23,791
The bomb will detonate if the
speed drops below one hundred.

629
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:25,125
The deactivation fee is
a hundred billion yen.

630
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:26,250
-"Oh my goodness."
-"The bomb is real?"

631
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:27,000
Oh!

632
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:27,833
-Yeah, that's what they're saying.
-What's going on?

633
00:27:27,916 --> 00:27:28,583
-It's a bomb!
-Huh?

634
00:27:28,666 --> 00:27:29,583
-I heard it's a bomb!
-A bomb?!

635
00:27:29,666 --> 00:27:30,666
"Yeah, it's a--"

636
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,375
One hunded billion? That's impossible!

637
00:27:32,458 --> 00:27:33,541
What the hell are you saying?

638
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:35,500
-"You really want us to die?"
-I'm saying it's impossible!

639
00:27:35,583 --> 00:27:36,333
Shut up!

640
00:27:39,833 --> 00:27:41,833
-No you shut up you, diva.
-Sit your ass down!

641
00:27:41,916 --> 00:27:43,416
Please wait!

642
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:44,791
Wait!

643
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:46,166
No, give me that!

644
00:27:49,541 --> 00:27:51,083
If we don't do something, we're dead!

645
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:52,166
We're all gonna die!

646
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:54,541
It's all going to shit!

647
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:58,250
-No, it's too dangerous, ma'am.
-I have to do something, Hayashi!

648
00:27:58,833 --> 00:28:01,375
-Wait, hey, calm down, okay?
-I don't care! We're all gonna die!

649
00:28:01,458 --> 00:28:02,750
I can't take this anymore.

650
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:06,000
-I wanna go home.
-The bomb will detonate if the

651
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:07,666
speed drops below one hundred.

652
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,875
The deactivation fee is
one hundred billion yen.

653
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:13,208
The bomb will detonate if the
speed drops below one hundred.

654
00:28:14,666 --> 00:28:17,791
IWATE TOWN, IWATE COUNTY,
IWATE PREFECTURE 531 KM TO TOKYO

655
00:28:19,958 --> 00:28:21,708
I sent the video to the Stock Center.

656
00:28:21,791 --> 00:28:23,250
They think the bomb was planted

657
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:24,833
on car four, on the
front left of the chassis.

658
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:25,958
Transport dispatcher.

659
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:26,916
There could

660
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,583
-be more than one bomb, though, right?
-Right.

661
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:29,125
Commander.

662
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:30,500
What is it?

663
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,875
Train thirty thirty-two B is
stopped just past Morioka

664
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:34,250
at switch number fifty-one.

665
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:37,541
It's ahead of the Hayabusa and unable
to move due to a malfunction.

666
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:38,250
What's the cause?

667
00:28:38,875 --> 00:28:39,666
Can we move it?

668
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:42,583
Apparently a bird collided with the
pantograph, so it short circuited.

669
00:28:42,666 --> 00:28:45,208
It's going to take at least an
hour to get it running again.

670
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:46,250
Move the Hayabusa to

671
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:47,291
the northbound track.

672
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:48,375
Not possible.

673
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:51,208
Thirty twenty-seven B is currently
on the northbound track.

674
00:28:51,291 --> 00:28:52,625
So they're going to collide!

675
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:56,333
3032B BOUND FOR TOKYO
STOPPED ON SOUTHBOUND TRACK

676
00:28:57,333 --> 00:29:00,833
3027B BOUND FOR SHIN-HAKODATE-HOKUTO
AND AKITA ON THE NORTHBOUND TRACK

677
00:29:00,916 --> 00:29:03,750
FIFTY SIXTY B BOUND FOR TOKYO
ON THE SOUTHBOUND MAIN LINE

678
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,333
Fifty sixty B is now eleven
kilometers from Morioka.

679
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:10,583
Five and a half minutes.

680
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:13,250
How long until Thirty twenty-seven
B passes Morioka?

681
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:14,500
Just under six minutes.

682
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:15,916
We have to do it.

683
00:29:16,541 --> 00:29:17,416
We route it northbound

684
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,208
on the main line and have it
run in a reverse direction

685
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:22,375
just before Morioka at switch sixty-three.

686
00:29:22,875 --> 00:29:25,583
Instruct Thirty twenty-seven
B to increase its speed.

687
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:26,541
Yes, sir!

688
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:28,708
-I'll notify Morioka Station!
-Yes, please.

689
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:31,250
Can you connect the short one to that?

690
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:32,250
Reverse direction?

691
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:33,625
Yes.

692
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:36,958
This is the train that's stopped,
the thirty thirty-two B.

693
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:38,333
This is the Fifty sixty B,

694
00:29:38,416 --> 00:29:39,833
the Hayabusa Number Sixty.

695
00:29:39,916 --> 00:29:42,833
And this is the Thirty twenty-seven B,
the Hayabusa Komachi twenty-seven,

696
00:29:42,916 --> 00:29:44,291
which is heading towards it.

697
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:48,750
The fifty-sixty B will switch
to the northbound track here.

698
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,416
But it's almost immediately after

699
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,333
the other one

700
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:54,166
passes the switch.

701
00:30:11,541 --> 00:30:12,250
…Switch it northbound.

702
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:13,208
That's what we'll do.

703
00:30:13,791 --> 00:30:15,125
-What?
-Trust me.

704
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:17,166
Slow your speed to 105
kilometers per hour.

705
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:19,958
We need to buy as much time as possible,
every second counts.

706
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:20,875
But

707
00:30:20,958 --> 00:30:22,666
entering a switch going that fast is

708
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:25,375
-far too dangerous!
-There's no other option here!

709
00:30:26,375 --> 00:30:29,208
Reduce your speed to 105 kilometers
per hour immediately!

710
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:33,500
Okay, copy that.

711
00:30:40,666 --> 00:30:41,250
120,

712
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,500
119,

713
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,708
118,

714
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:45,208
115,

715
00:30:45,958 --> 00:30:46,583
112,

716
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,625
110, 109,

717
00:30:49,541 --> 00:30:50,375
108,

718
00:30:51,041 --> 00:30:51,875
105.

719
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:05,166
Apparently it's supposed to shake a lot.

720
00:31:05,666 --> 00:31:08,208
We have to make sure the
passengers are seated.

721
00:31:12,583 --> 00:31:14,875
Don't let the passengers
see you looking like that.

722
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:15,625
Got it?

723
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:17,250
O-- Okay.

724
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:26,250
We are approaching a switch

725
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,583
and the train will shake quite a bit.

726
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:30,666
So everyone remain seated for your safety.

727
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,333
And please keep your heads, down.

728
00:31:32,416 --> 00:31:34,250
-Please put your seats back in place.
-Put the seats back, kids!

729
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:36,333
-We expect the train to shake quite a bit.
-Yuzuki,

730
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:38,833
-So, please remain seated!
-don't leave me, okay?

731
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:47,458
If you could please remain seated,

732
00:31:47,541 --> 00:31:48,625
keep your heads down,

733
00:31:48,708 --> 00:31:49,916
for your own safety.

734
00:31:50,416 --> 00:31:51,458
Stay low.

735
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:52,791
-Keep your heads down.
-Sir--

736
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:54,958
Sir, uh-- why did you say that?

737
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:56,375
Is the bomb going off?

738
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:58,708
No. It's to prevent it from going off.

739
00:31:58,791 --> 00:31:59,666
Don't worry.

740
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,250
Please just follow our instructions
for now, okay?

741
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:04,583
For your own safety, please remain seated.

742
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:07,916
Thirty twenty-seven B is
now approaching Morioka

743
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,375
at 320 kilometers per hour.

744
00:32:09,458 --> 00:32:10,791
Good. Maintain that speed.

745
00:32:13,916 --> 00:32:15,000
Fifty sixty B,

746
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:15,958
slow down to 102!

747
00:32:17,458 --> 00:32:18,458
We need every last second.

748
00:32:32,708 --> 00:32:33,375
103…

749
00:32:34,125 --> 00:32:34,958
102…

750
00:32:54,541 --> 00:32:57,208
MORIOKA CITY, IWATE PREFECTURE

751
00:32:58,458 --> 00:32:59,583
The train thirty
twenty-seven B will soon be arriving.

752
00:32:59,666 --> 00:33:00,791
Keep going, please.

753
00:33:00,875 --> 00:33:01,916
Keep going forward.

754
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:04,208
-They'll help at the ticket gates.
-"Yes, that way, please."

755
00:33:04,291 --> 00:33:05,916
-Sir, please stand back!
-The train thirty

756
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,541
-twenty-seven B will soon be arriving.
-Stand back!

757
00:33:11,458 --> 00:33:12,291
The train's here!

758
00:33:15,125 --> 00:33:17,791
DEPUTY HEAD, RAILWAY OPERATIONS,
MORIOKA BRANCH OFFICE

759
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:20,875
Thirty twenty-seven B

760
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:22,833
just passed Morioka Station.

761
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,125
Fifty sixty B is now approaching
the switch!

762
00:33:41,291 --> 00:33:43,166
Thirty twenty-seven B
is passing the switch!

763
00:33:43,666 --> 00:33:45,041
Reverse switch sixty-three.

764
00:33:45,541 --> 00:33:46,625
Now!

765
00:33:53,875 --> 00:33:54,666
It's dropping.

766
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,083
Faster!

767
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:44,625
This is the Thirty twenty-seven B driver.

768
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:46,125
We've just made an emergency stop.

769
00:34:46,791 --> 00:34:48,666
The conductor's checking the situation.

770
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,375
This is the Fifty sixty B driver.

771
00:34:50,458 --> 00:34:52,083
Our first car collided with them.

772
00:34:52,833 --> 00:34:53,958
There was a big impact,

773
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:56,416
but so far the train seems
to be running fine.

774
00:34:56,916 --> 00:34:57,791
Got it.

775
00:34:58,291 --> 00:34:59,791
We've confirmed that as well.

776
00:35:02,125 --> 00:35:03,666
Increase the speed to 120,

777
00:35:04,208 --> 00:35:06,750
and move back to the southbound
line using switch number fifty-three.

778
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:07,750
Copy that.

779
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:23,500
You need it?

780
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:25,625
Takaichi,

781
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:27,208
what was that impact?

782
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,791
There was a slight collision
with an oncoming train, but

783
00:35:29,875 --> 00:35:31,666
we made it safely through the switch

784
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,333
and the train's running without problems.

785
00:35:33,416 --> 00:35:34,333
So don't worry.

786
00:35:37,541 --> 00:35:38,750
Well done, Mister Takaichi.

787
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:39,500
Sure.

788
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,375
Just doing my job. Excuse me.

789
00:35:41,458 --> 00:35:43,333
-Good thing she's on board.
-It's okay now.

790
00:35:43,416 --> 00:35:44,750
-Thank god she's here.
-Having a member of the

791
00:35:44,833 --> 00:35:45,958
Parliament on board's definitely a relief.

792
00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:47,666
All she did was sit there, c'mon.

793
00:35:53,666 --> 00:35:54,958
Was everything okay there?

794
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:56,458
I…

795
00:35:57,125 --> 00:35:58,125
thought I was about to die.

796
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:00,791
Don't tempt fate, you know?

797
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:08,250
I'll go see what's going on.

798
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:10,291
Okay.

799
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,375
Excuse me.

800
00:36:26,791 --> 00:36:28,333
I have a, uh-- favor to ask.

801
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,208
Oh!

802
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:34,666
Uhh- Hi folks!

803
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:37,041
Sorry to disturb you during
these hard times.

804
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:39,541
This is… To Do Rock It!

805
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:42,291
-My name is Mitsuru Todoroki.
-Fujii…

806
00:36:42,875 --> 00:36:46,083
You know the author of the best-selling
book "Unemployed Rich Man"

807
00:36:46,166 --> 00:36:47,166
does that ring a bell.

808
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:48,583
That's me. I'm the author.

809
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:51,500
The bomber's video.

810
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,208
You all saw it, yeah?

811
00:36:53,291 --> 00:36:54,000
-I did.
-Yeah.

812
00:36:55,291 --> 00:36:58,958
He mentioned a deactivation fee of one
hundred billion yen from the entire

813
00:36:59,041 --> 00:37:01,541
-nation.
-He's even more handsome in person.

814
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:04,083
As far as I can tell, no one has made
any real moves to deal with this up to

815
00:37:04,166 --> 00:37:06,458
-this point, right?
-His clothes look super expensive.

816
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:07,708
I wouldn't expect less from him.

817
00:37:07,791 --> 00:37:09,083
You know, at a time like this,

818
00:37:09,166 --> 00:37:12,958
we're all hoping the government's going
to take the lead and act fast to help us.

819
00:37:13,041 --> 00:37:14,833
However, a huge ship requires a great

820
00:37:14,916 --> 00:37:15,791
deal of time and effort

821
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:18,333
to make even a slight change of course.

822
00:37:18,416 --> 00:37:19,333
For that reason,

823
00:37:19,916 --> 00:37:22,791
I've created a website so that
we can start collecting money.

824
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:25,291
I've posted all the details
on social media,

825
00:37:25,375 --> 00:37:26,375
so please check it out.

826
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:28,708
-You heard that, didn't you?
-Let's spread the word

827
00:37:28,791 --> 00:37:29,750
-about it as much as we can.
-So cool.

828
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:31,166
-Look, right here.
-This guy, right?

829
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,625
You know, we're the ones stuck in this
train right now, so it's only fair we ask

830
00:37:33,708 --> 00:37:36,375
-the country to chip in.
-I don't know how to do that!

831
00:37:36,916 --> 00:37:37,750
Hey,

832
00:37:38,375 --> 00:37:39,541
-what if we all make a video…
-Right.

833
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:40,375
Hey, guys.

834
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:41,833
Let's make a video too.

835
00:37:41,916 --> 00:37:42,791
Post it on Insta

836
00:37:42,875 --> 00:37:44,250
or whatever. Right?

837
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,458
-"Oh… yeah that's a good idea!"
-In this day and age, we have

838
00:37:46,541 --> 00:37:48,166
everything we need to look after
ourselves.

839
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:49,916
Come on, where should we post that?

840
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,541
We can't just rely on the government
or local authorities.

841
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:54,625
-Let's turn despair into hope.
-Okay?

842
00:37:54,708 --> 00:37:55,333
Let's do it!

843
00:37:55,916 --> 00:37:56,708
Alright?

844
00:37:56,791 --> 00:37:58,166
Let's make a miracle happen.

845
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,375
To Do Rock It!

846
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:03,916
Thank you for listening, y'all.

847
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,500
Excuse me.

848
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,208
Coming through. Sorry.

849
00:38:14,708 --> 00:38:15,791
Sorry, coming through.

850
00:38:17,708 --> 00:38:18,458
Why…?

851
00:38:34,541 --> 00:38:36,458
We're students at Taiyo High School.

852
00:38:36,541 --> 00:38:37,333
My name's Aoi.

853
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:40,750
We're currently on board
the Hayabusa Number Sixty.

854
00:38:41,333 --> 00:38:43,333
-Don't give up on us, alright?
-We need your help.

855
00:38:43,416 --> 00:38:45,458
"Please help us." "Donate as much as you
can." "Please don't give up on us."

856
00:38:45,541 --> 00:38:46,166
Wait…

857
00:38:46,666 --> 00:38:47,833
-Oh, it's right here.
-Where is it?

858
00:38:47,916 --> 00:38:48,541
-Oh, right.
-Oh, this is it!

859
00:38:48,625 --> 00:38:49,333
Noice--

860
00:38:49,416 --> 00:38:51,666
We're on board the Hayabusa
Number Sixty right now.

861
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:54,750
-We heard someone's trying to blow it up.
-Yeah, yeah. Oh, can I have some water?

862
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:55,583
Sure.

863
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,875
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you so much.

864
00:38:56,958 --> 00:38:58,958
Here, this is it. Check this out.

865
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,875
#I_SENT_MONEY

866
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:30,166
I'm Fukuda from the Daily Nitto.

867
00:39:31,291 --> 00:39:33,375
A civilian has already set
up a donation website,

868
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:36,000
but there's still no word on
the government's response.

869
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:37,541
What's your take on this?

870
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:41,166
We are aware of the existence
of this website.

871
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:43,458
We learned about it through
news reports earlier.

872
00:39:44,458 --> 00:39:46,875
However,
this is not in line with our policy of

873
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:49,625
not negotiating with the
demands of terrorists.

874
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:52,000
We're considering the possibility of

875
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:53,125
closing this website.

876
00:39:53,875 --> 00:39:55,583
So you're abandoning the
people in the train?

877
00:39:55,666 --> 00:39:58,208
Do you have a clear strategy for
handling this situation yet, sir?

878
00:39:58,291 --> 00:39:59,583
-Yeah, do you, sir?
-What're your thoughts?

879
00:39:59,666 --> 00:40:00,666
How will the government
tackle this problem?

880
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:02,125
What else do you have in mind?

881
00:40:02,208 --> 00:40:05,458
-What authorities have you consulted?
-Please let us know your thoughts!

882
00:40:05,541 --> 00:40:09,291
At around twelve forty-five p.m.
on August thirtieth nineteen seventy-five,

883
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:10,833
there was a sudden explosion.

884
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:14,000
I was shocked by that huge
cloud of smoke in the sky.

885
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:16,583
An investigation was launched
immediately and a joint task force was

886
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:18,458
-created.
-You're not doing anything!

887
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:21,083
Based on everything we've seen so far

888
00:40:21,166 --> 00:40:23,791
and the information we've
gathered up to this point,

889
00:40:23,875 --> 00:40:27,416
one thing is clear—
the perpetrators used dynamite components.

890
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,958
The most important question:

891
00:40:29,458 --> 00:40:31,916
Who planted the bombs and
what was their motive?

892
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:35,875
Acts of terrorism such as this
one should never be tolerated.

893
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:37,416
The type of bombs used,

894
00:40:38,083 --> 00:40:40,208
the warning explosion
to support the threat,

895
00:40:40,291 --> 00:40:41,375
the deactivation fee…

896
00:40:42,416 --> 00:40:43,291
It's a carbon copy

897
00:40:43,791 --> 00:40:46,291
of the "one-oh-nine case"
in nineteen seventy-five.

898
00:40:46,375 --> 00:40:48,083
I'm sure there's a connection
between them.

899
00:40:48,166 --> 00:40:49,083
There has to be.

900
00:40:49,666 --> 00:40:52,250
The only difference is the
amount they're asking for.

901
00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:54,416
Even factoring in inflation,

902
00:40:55,041 --> 00:40:57,791
one hundred billion yen is roughly
seventy times higher.

903
00:40:57,875 --> 00:41:01,416
Telling us to 'figure out' how to
gather that ridiculous sum is just

904
00:41:02,166 --> 00:41:03,166
plain insulting.

905
00:41:09,125 --> 00:41:10,291
Mister Todoroki,

906
00:41:11,208 --> 00:41:12,125
can you hear me?

907
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:13,166
-Let's go with Camera three.
-Yes.

908
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:14,625
-Keep it on Camera three.
-Seems like the

909
00:41:14,708 --> 00:41:17,375
government wasn't particularly
happy with your website.

910
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:22,041
Yeah, I mean, I'm making them look bad,
so of course they wouldn't like it.

911
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:24,666
It's like my website is worse
than terrorism, huh?

912
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,125
I don't get why they're criticizing it.

913
00:41:26,208 --> 00:41:27,458
They should be thanking me

914
00:41:27,541 --> 00:41:28,958
for taking definitive action.

915
00:41:29,041 --> 00:41:30,041
There are

916
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:32,750
concerns about whether the money
is being handled transparently.

917
00:41:32,833 --> 00:41:34,166
I've just added a meter,

918
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:37,708
so now everyone can see how much
money has been gathered so far.

919
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:38,458
Well,

920
00:41:38,958 --> 00:41:40,958
that doesn't help if their issue is
with me specifically being behind this.

921
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:42,333
Look at that reaction.

922
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:45,041
-That's good, switch to camera four.
-Okay, camera four. Get that reaction.

923
00:41:45,125 --> 00:41:47,541
As you can see, I'm a hostage,
so I can't just run off with the cash.

924
00:41:47,625 --> 00:41:51,750
Just think of it as like a subscription to
an exciting show and throw in some money!

925
00:41:51,833 --> 00:41:53,458
To Do Rock It!

926
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:55,791
Mitsuru Todoroki, out!

927
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:00,958
Todoroki-san…

928
00:42:01,833 --> 00:42:05,750
I think a more levelheaded approach would
be in everyone's best interest, right?

929
00:42:05,833 --> 00:42:08,125
Handing over a hundred
billion as they demand?

930
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:09,333
That's madness!

931
00:42:09,833 --> 00:42:11,041
On a weighted average,

932
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:15,041
Hayabusa Sixty's passengers have about
forty-five years left to live. See?

933
00:42:16,041 --> 00:42:18,583
If they all spend around three hundred
million in their lifetime,

934
00:42:18,666 --> 00:42:21,708
then every passenger's death equates to
a loss of one hundred sixty million.

935
00:42:21,791 --> 00:42:24,375
Let's multiply that by three
hundred and fifty passengers.

936
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:25,625
Fifty six billion yen.

937
00:42:25,708 --> 00:42:27,833
-Ah.
-Factor in lost revenue, compensation,

938
00:42:27,916 --> 00:42:30,125
damages and whatnot, and suddenly, one
hundred billion

939
00:42:30,208 --> 00:42:31,583
doesn't seem so far-fetched.

940
00:42:32,916 --> 00:42:34,708
The stance against negotiating
with terrorists

941
00:42:34,791 --> 00:42:36,833
exists to prevent further acts of terror.

942
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,958
You don't get it, do you?
You're just being impulsive and selfish.

943
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:43,000
All that talk about principles--
can't you see we're about to die?

944
00:42:43,083 --> 00:42:44,041
By the way, Kagami-san…

945
00:42:44,541 --> 00:42:47,000
why don't you use your power as
a member of the Parliament to

946
00:42:47,083 --> 00:42:49,083
give a little boost to
our collective funding.

947
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:51,250
We need to find some kind of synergy here.

948
00:42:51,916 --> 00:42:53,416
Synergy? What're you, nuts?

949
00:42:54,291 --> 00:42:55,625
Why don't you stop trying--

950
00:42:57,083 --> 00:42:58,958
You're aware we don't have much time, huh?

951
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:02,875
The sooner you start helping us collect,
the better our chances are.

952
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:05,208
If we're being reasonable about it.

953
00:43:16,208 --> 00:43:18,541
KITAKAMI CITY,

KINTEKI GOOD LUCK, SEARCHING TARGET

You're Goto, from "Go
To Chopper Tours", right?

956
00:43:25,416 --> 00:43:26,125
Go-chan.

957
00:43:26,708 --> 00:43:29,875
Did you know your picture's a trending
topic on social media right now?

958
00:43:29,958 --> 00:43:31,375
-Check it out.
-Sure you knew.

959
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:32,875
Tons of folks are saying

960
00:43:32,958 --> 00:43:35,291
that they won't pay the
deactivation fee because you're on board.

961
00:43:35,375 --> 00:43:36,208
You guys know him?

962
00:43:36,291 --> 00:43:36,875
-It's Goto.
-You know?

963
00:43:36,958 --> 00:43:37,375
That Goto.

964
00:43:37,875 --> 00:43:39,583
But if you apologize on
camera, maybe that could change.

965
00:43:39,666 --> 00:43:40,583
That's right.

966
00:43:40,666 --> 00:43:41,583
-Stop it.
-Yeah.

967
00:43:41,666 --> 00:43:42,541
-Stop it.
-Do it.

968
00:43:42,625 --> 00:43:45,458
You could admit that it was your fault
that a poorly maintained tourist

969
00:43:45,541 --> 00:43:48,291
helicopter crashed into a
school and killed eight people.

970
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:49,833
Just say you're sorry, dude.

971
00:43:50,583 --> 00:43:52,000
Oh, he's being violent. This
is bad. Bad, bad, bad, bad.

972
00:43:52,083 --> 00:43:54,000
You think I'm gonna say I'm sorry just
because you assholes are telling me to?

973
00:43:54,083 --> 00:43:55,083
Wait, wait…

974
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:58,208
-Stop recording! Stop recording!
-More people are gonna die because of you!

975
00:43:58,791 --> 00:44:01,916
Just say you're sorry, dude!
Get on your knees and apologize!

976
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,916
On your knees! There you go, buddy.

978

-Thank you.

979
00:44:06,958 --> 00:44:07,916
Kinteki Good Luck.

980
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,625
Get off me!

981
00:44:13,375 --> 00:44:14,625
Out of the way!

982
00:44:15,708 --> 00:44:18,250
What's wrong with you,
dude? Just say you're sorry!

983
00:44:19,708 --> 00:44:21,000
Aren't you the one in charge?

984
00:44:21,083 --> 00:44:22,750
Shouldn't you be intervening here?

985
00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:24,666
You're the one who's a big hero.

986
00:44:25,166 --> 00:44:26,208
You intervene.

987
00:44:26,291 --> 00:44:27,375
Drop kick!

988
00:44:27,458 --> 00:44:28,083
Hey!

989
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:30,125
Sorry,

990
00:44:30,625 --> 00:44:31,541
-excuse me.
-Please stop.

991
00:44:31,625 --> 00:44:32,166
Sorry.

992
00:44:32,666 --> 00:44:33,750
-Calm down.
-Get away, please.

993
00:44:33,833 --> 00:44:34,875
-Calm down, please.
-Calm down, please.

994
00:44:34,958 --> 00:44:36,250
-Everyone calm down.
-Please.

995
00:44:36,333 --> 00:44:37,250
Are you okay, sir?

996
00:44:40,625 --> 00:44:41,541
Let me off.

997
00:44:42,083 --> 00:44:43,416
I wanna get off this train!

998
00:44:44,375 --> 00:44:45,458
Takaichi!

999
00:44:45,541 --> 00:44:46,791
Are you okay, sir?

1000
00:44:49,166 --> 00:44:51,000
Oh, no. Don't… What're you--

1001
00:44:51,083 --> 00:44:52,041
Hey, don't run away!

1002
00:44:52,541 --> 00:44:53,416
Get off me!

1003
00:44:53,916 --> 00:44:55,166
I'm getting off this train!

1004
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:56,375
Please!

1005
00:44:56,875 --> 00:44:57,708
Press it!

1006
00:44:58,208 --> 00:44:59,833
-Press the button!
-Don't press it!

1007
00:44:59,916 --> 00:45:00,625
Don't press it!

1008
00:45:01,125 --> 00:45:02,625
Please! Now!

1009
00:45:02,708 --> 00:45:03,458
Please!

1010
00:45:03,958 --> 00:45:05,041
Do it!

1011
00:45:22,416 --> 00:45:23,958
There's nothing to worry about.

1012
00:45:24,041 --> 00:45:25,500
That button only alerts the driver,

1013
00:45:25,583 --> 00:45:26,875
it doesn't stop the train.

1014
00:45:28,416 --> 00:45:29,291
Matsumoto,

1015
00:45:29,375 --> 00:45:30,833
this is Conductor Takaichi.

1016
00:45:31,416 --> 00:45:32,583
A passenger pressed the
button by mistake during a fight.

1017
00:45:32,666 --> 00:45:33,875
Oh man, I thought that was it for us.

1018
00:45:33,958 --> 00:45:35,375
Just keep the train running.

1019
00:45:35,458 --> 00:45:36,083
I'm sorry.

1020
00:45:36,583 --> 00:45:37,625
Coming through.

1021
00:45:37,708 --> 00:45:38,750
I'm sorry, excuse me.

1022
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:45,250
May I have

1023
00:45:45,333 --> 00:45:46,583
your attention, please?

1024
00:45:46,666 --> 00:45:48,208
Is there a doctor on board?

1025
00:45:48,916 --> 00:45:49,875
If you are a doctor,

1026
00:45:49,958 --> 00:45:51,666
please come to Car number five.

1027
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:53,708
Fifty sixty B

1028
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:56,000
is passing the Four Forty Kilometer point!

1029
00:46:09,291 --> 00:46:11,125
He's okay, it's not life-threatening.

1030
00:46:11,208 --> 00:46:12,708
Just let him rest for a while.

1031
00:46:13,333 --> 00:46:14,333
Thank you very much.

1032
00:46:18,958 --> 00:46:19,875
What's the point

1033
00:46:20,958 --> 00:46:22,208
of saving a man like him?

1034
00:46:23,916 --> 00:46:25,041
What are you talking about?

1035
00:46:25,541 --> 00:46:27,125
We could die because of this guy.

1036
00:46:27,625 --> 00:46:29,875
You heard what they said about him, right?

1037
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:32,583
And so saving him is pointless?

1038
00:46:33,125 --> 00:46:34,583
It doesn't make sense, though.

1039
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,916
What if we can't raise enough
money for the ransom

1040
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,916
and we die because of
him? That's absolutely crazy!

1041
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,750
Delivering our passengers
safely to their destinations.

1042
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:45,750
That's the whole point of us being here.

1043
00:46:49,583 --> 00:46:51,083
I'm going to the driver's cab.

1044
00:47:17,625 --> 00:47:19,166
When the SOS button was pressed,

1045
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:20,708
I almost stopped the train, y'know?

1046
00:47:21,208 --> 00:47:22,208
Yeah, that's not funny.

1047
00:47:22,708 --> 00:47:23,708
Want some water?

1048
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:25,666
Not really, but thanks.

1049
00:47:26,166 --> 00:47:28,500
I can't go to the bathroom,
so why risk it, right?

1050
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,208
You're right.

1051
00:47:30,291 --> 00:47:31,500
Is there anything else you need?

1052
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,250
A cheeseburger with fries

1053
00:47:34,333 --> 00:47:35,583
and an apple pie, thanks.

1054
00:47:37,208 --> 00:47:39,166
I'll get that once we're outta here.

1055
00:47:41,416 --> 00:47:43,083
I won't stop the train even if I die.

1056
00:47:44,458 --> 00:47:45,375
So don't you worry.

1057
00:47:46,166 --> 00:47:47,416
That's not funny, either.

1058
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:07,166
Oh, Takaichi.

1059
00:48:09,125 --> 00:48:10,375
Uhh- here.

1060
00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:13,208
MORIOKA SHINKANSEN CREW DEPOT

1061
00:48:13,291 --> 00:48:16,375
FIRST-LINE MANAGER, TAKAICHI,
SPECIAL ASSISTANCE STAFF

1062
00:48:17,583 --> 00:48:18,291
Thank you.

1063
00:48:18,791 --> 00:48:20,208
Are you okay, by the way?

1064
00:48:21,041 --> 00:48:21,625
Uhh--

1065
00:48:22,125 --> 00:48:22,833
I'm sorry, sir.

1066
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:25,208
You got in trouble with the driver because

1067
00:48:25,291 --> 00:48:26,375
I pressed that button.

1068
00:48:26,916 --> 00:48:27,916
Hey, don't be sorry.

1069
00:48:28,666 --> 00:48:30,666
Everyone was stunned when you pressed it,

1070
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:32,416
which helped defuse the situation.

1071
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:33,916
You saved us.

1072
00:48:34,416 --> 00:48:35,416
Thank you.

1073
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:38,833
Uh-Why did you save a guy like him? Uhh…

1074
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,916
What, made you do it?

1075
00:48:42,291 --> 00:48:43,208
A guy like him?

1076
00:48:44,375 --> 00:48:45,625
A person everybody hates.

1077
00:48:46,583 --> 00:48:48,333
And who's probably better off dead.

1078
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:51,500
Funny-- Someone just asked me that.

1079
00:48:52,291 --> 00:48:53,541
And what was your answer?

1080
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:56,916
That it wasn't a big deal.

1081
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,500
Because it's your duty, right?

1082
00:49:00,541 --> 00:49:02,083
Ensuring his safety is my duty.

1083
00:49:02,791 --> 00:49:05,666
That doesn't mean it's always simple,
that much I can say.

1084
00:49:06,541 --> 00:49:07,416
But truth is,

1085
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,750
I wanted to save him,
I'm not lying to you.

1086
00:49:17,166 --> 00:49:18,083
I'm sorry, that was, uh…

1087
00:49:18,583 --> 00:49:19,791
a weird thing to ask.

1088
00:49:34,875 --> 00:49:37,666
You want to uncouple the last
car of the Hayabusa Sixty?

1089
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:38,666
While it's running?

1090
00:49:39,916 --> 00:49:41,291
Is that gonna even possible?

1091
00:49:45,416 --> 00:49:49,500
Shinkansen trains automatically apply the
brakes if cars become uncoupled while

1092
00:49:49,583 --> 00:49:50,250
in motion.

1093
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:51,833
But it is technically possible

1094
00:49:51,916 --> 00:49:53,500
if we disable that system.

1095
00:49:54,333 --> 00:49:54,958
First,

1096
00:49:55,541 --> 00:49:58,208
we'll have another train run parallel
to the Hayabusa Sixty to provide them

1097
00:49:58,291 --> 00:49:59,958
with the tools they'll need for the job.

1098
00:50:00,041 --> 00:50:02,458
We'll open the crew cabin's
door and transfer

1099
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:05,750
the tools from one train to the
other using ropes and pulleys.

1100
00:50:05,833 --> 00:50:07,875
Once they pull all the
tools into the train,

1101
00:50:08,375 --> 00:50:10,750
the tech guys at the stock center
will guide them over the phone

1102
00:50:10,833 --> 00:50:12,333
on how to disconnect both cars,

1103
00:50:12,416 --> 00:50:13,791
physically and electrically.

1104
00:50:15,166 --> 00:50:16,500
Once the last car is uncoupled,

1105
00:50:16,583 --> 00:50:20,625
a rescue train without a front car will
catch up to the Hayabusa sixty and

1106
00:50:20,708 --> 00:50:22,541
connect to it's second-to-last car.

1107
00:50:24,125 --> 00:50:25,041
Wait a minute…

1108
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:26,875
So you're gonna move

1109
00:50:27,375 --> 00:50:28,541
the passengers from here

1110
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:29,250
to here,

1111
00:50:30,041 --> 00:50:32,041
and then the rescue train will just leave?

1112
00:50:32,125 --> 00:50:33,041
That's right, yes.

1113
00:50:33,541 --> 00:50:37,125
And you have to do all that while going
120 kilometers per hour without using

1114
00:50:37,208 --> 00:50:38,166
the emergency brakes?

1115
00:50:39,125 --> 00:50:41,958
Are you absolutely sure this
is the best plan we've got?

1116
00:50:42,041 --> 00:50:43,708
I don't know if it's the best.

1117
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,833
But the question is,
are we doing it or not?

1118
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,750
We have a responsibility.

1119
00:50:52,833 --> 00:50:55,250
ICHINOSEKI CITY,
IWATE PREFECTURE 410 KM TO TOKYO

1120
00:51:09,791 --> 00:51:10,708
He's awake.

1121
00:51:11,291 --> 00:51:12,333
I gave him some water

1122
00:51:12,416 --> 00:51:13,708
and made sure he was okay.

1123
00:51:14,541 --> 00:51:15,375
Great,

1124
00:51:16,166 --> 00:51:16,833
thank you.

1125
00:51:19,541 --> 00:51:20,458
What's next?

1126
00:51:21,083 --> 00:51:22,083
What's the plan now?

1127
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:24,541
We should rest in shifts--

1128
00:51:28,083 --> 00:51:28,750
Hello,

1129
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:30,791
this is the Fifty sixty B's conductor.

1130
00:51:30,875 --> 00:51:32,875
This is Kasagi. Open your tablet.

1131
00:51:32,958 --> 00:51:34,000
Copy that.

1132
00:51:35,291 --> 00:51:37,583
We're carrying out the rescue plan now.

1133
00:51:37,666 --> 00:51:39,916
Check the document I've just shared.

1134
00:51:40,583 --> 00:51:41,583
Okay, got it.

1135
00:51:41,666 --> 00:51:42,833
I'll open it up now.

1136
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:47,125
Next is the rescue plan.

1137
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:52,125
ANNOUNCEMENT

1138
00:51:54,416 --> 00:51:56,083
May I have your attention, please?

1139
00:51:56,583 --> 00:51:57,500
We're about to start

1140
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,875
the rescue operation.

1141
00:52:00,666 --> 00:52:01,875
Please remain seated

1142
00:52:02,375 --> 00:52:04,250
-until further instructions from the crew.
-Did you hear that?

1143
00:52:04,333 --> 00:52:05,041
Also,

1144
00:52:05,541 --> 00:52:07,916
If any qualified electricians or
similarly trained individuals are aboard

1145
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,375
Everyone, be quiet!

1146
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:14,333
Please make your way to the conductor's
cabin in Car Nine.

1147
00:52:14,916 --> 00:52:15,750
-What's going on here?
-I repeat.

1148
00:52:15,833 --> 00:52:16,666
Honey,

1149
00:52:17,208 --> 00:52:18,666
-it's finally time for you to help people.
-Attention, all passengers.

1150
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:19,416
Huh?

1151
00:52:19,916 --> 00:52:21,208
-We're about to start
-Listen, they need an electrician.

1152
00:52:21,291 --> 00:52:22,750
The rescue operation.

1153
00:52:22,833 --> 00:52:24,291
They need an electrician.

1154
00:52:26,083 --> 00:52:27,750
The last car has to be
uncoupled before the

1155
00:52:27,833 --> 00:52:29,666
Fifty sixty B passes the Stock Center.

1156
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:32,208
Transport dispatchers,
switch to the group call from now on.

1157
00:52:32,291 --> 00:52:32,916
Copy.

1158
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:34,458
Situation?

1159
00:52:36,291 --> 00:52:38,708
Ninety twelve B is now approaching
Fifty sixty B.

1160
00:52:40,125 --> 00:52:41,708
Ninety twelve B will
move to the northbound

1161
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:43,125
line at switch fifty-three.

1162
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,583
Fifty sixty B is forty four kilometers
from the Stock Center. Travel time,

1163
00:52:54,666 --> 00:52:55,583
twenty-two minutes.

1164
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,750
Can I have your attention?

1165
00:53:03,833 --> 00:53:06,625
We're going to start the rescue
operation, and this car will be uncoupled.

1166
00:53:06,708 --> 00:53:07,583
Finally.

1167
00:53:07,666 --> 00:53:08,708
-Now I'm going to need you follow me
-What?

1168
00:53:08,791 --> 00:53:09,833
-What's going on?
-To the car in front us,

1169
00:53:09,916 --> 00:53:10,875
-please. Right this way.
-What's wrong?

1170
00:53:10,958 --> 00:53:11,583
Hey!

1171
00:53:12,083 --> 00:53:13,375
Unfortunately you'll have
to leave your luggage behind.

1172
00:53:13,458 --> 00:53:15,125
Wait a sec- Who in the what now?

1173
00:53:19,083 --> 00:53:20,041
Here it comes!

1174
00:53:52,166 --> 00:53:53,375
Ninety twelve B is here.

1175
00:53:54,041 --> 00:53:54,625
Our speed

1176
00:53:55,208 --> 00:53:55,916
is fixed at 120.

1177
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,833
This is Ninety twelve B.

1178
00:53:58,583 --> 00:54:00,708
Just keep your speed fixed
at one hundred twenty.

1179
00:54:00,791 --> 00:54:02,375
We'll adjust if needed.

1180
00:54:03,833 --> 00:54:04,708
A little slower.

1181
00:54:05,333 --> 00:54:05,958
Slower, slower.

1182
00:54:06,458 --> 00:54:07,500
Fix it.

1183
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:09,666
Open the crew door.

1184
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:11,750
-Go ahead, Ninomiya.
-Okay, I'm on it.

1185
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:16,541
-Oh!
-Careful!

1186
00:54:18,458 --> 00:54:19,750
Launching the guide rope.

1187
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:21,125
-Step back!
-Direction, check.

1188
00:54:21,208 --> 00:54:23,250
-Pressure, check.
-Launch!

1189
00:54:23,333 --> 00:54:24,208
Pick it up!

1190
00:54:24,291 --> 00:54:25,083
Yep!

1191
00:54:25,583 --> 00:54:27,333
-Yes, I got it!
-They're pulling it.

1192
00:54:27,416 --> 00:54:28,541
Tie the guide rope!

1193
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:30,375
Okay, it's done!

1194
00:54:31,041 --> 00:54:31,708
Great.

1195
00:54:32,208 --> 00:54:33,500
-You can send it!
-Okay!

1196
00:54:33,583 --> 00:54:34,208
Okay!

1197
00:54:34,916 --> 00:54:35,541
Lift the cargo.

1198
00:54:36,041 --> 00:54:36,958
Okay,

1199
00:54:37,041 --> 00:54:38,333
-keep it at that height.
-Pull it!

1200
00:54:38,416 --> 00:54:39,125
Okay.

1201
00:54:39,625 --> 00:54:41,666
The first batch is being
transferred, cargo units one and two.

1202
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:42,291
Yeah.

1203
00:54:42,958 --> 00:54:43,625
-Take this.
-Good, keep going.

1204
00:54:43,708 --> 00:54:44,250
Okay!

1205
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:45,791
Eighteen minutes to the Stock Center.

1206
00:54:45,875 --> 00:54:46,916
That's it.

1207
00:54:47,916 --> 00:54:48,583
Keep pulling.

1208
00:54:49,125 --> 00:54:50,041
Almost done. Keep it up!

1209
00:54:50,541 --> 00:54:51,666
Easy, now!

1210
00:54:53,208 --> 00:54:53,666
Are you okay?

1211
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:55,083
Yes!

1212
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:56,583
The first shipment's here!

1213
00:54:56,666 --> 00:54:58,750
Second shipment. Pipes and cargo three.

1214
00:54:58,833 --> 00:54:59,375
Let's go!

1215
00:54:59,958 --> 00:55:00,416
-Okay!
-Come on!

1216
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:00,791
Yeah!

1217
00:55:00,875 --> 00:55:01,125
Keep pulling!

1218
00:55:01,625 --> 00:55:02,250
-Pull it!
-Twenty-nine

1219
00:55:02,333 --> 00:55:03,875
kilometers to the stock center.

1220
00:55:03,958 --> 00:55:05,125
-I got it!
-Alright!

1221
00:55:05,208 --> 00:55:06,541
Now for the third and last shipment.

1222
00:55:06,625 --> 00:55:08,666
-That's it. Keep going.
-Watch out, the uncoupler's really heavy!

1223
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:11,041
Fifty sixty B will soon
pass Furukawa Station.

1224
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:13,708
Fourteen minutes to the Stock Center.

1225
00:55:22,333 --> 00:55:23,250
Here it comes.

1226
00:55:25,041 --> 00:55:25,916
Everything okay?

1227
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,083
Everything's okay.

1228
00:55:27,166 --> 00:55:28,125
We have all the gear.

1229
00:55:28,208 --> 00:55:29,333
Thank you!

1230
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:30,875
This is Ninety twelve B.

1231
00:55:31,375 --> 00:55:32,375
We're all set.

1232
00:55:32,875 --> 00:55:34,625
We're praying for Fifty sixty B's safety.

1233
00:55:35,125 --> 00:55:36,250
Copy that.

1234
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,000
Let's connect them to the engineers.

1235
00:55:38,083 --> 00:55:40,666
We have twelve minutes to
complete the uncoupling.

1236
00:55:41,916 --> 00:55:43,708
SHINKANSEN ROLLING STOCK
MAINTENANCE CENTER

1237
00:55:45,166 --> 00:55:49,916
The uncoupling process for Hayabusa Sixty
is about to begin at assembly plant

1238
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,041
spot six.

1239
00:55:51,125 --> 00:55:52,958
It's connected. Go ahead.

1240
00:55:55,291 --> 00:55:56,125
Let's begin.

1241
00:55:56,208 --> 00:55:57,333
-Okay.
-Okay.

1242
00:55:58,416 --> 00:56:01,291
Open the wall panel next to the
left-side door in car eight.

1243
00:56:01,875 --> 00:56:02,500
Okay.

1244
00:56:05,333 --> 00:56:08,125
Do you see a row of wires labeled BRK?

1245
00:56:08,958 --> 00:56:09,708
I see it.

1246
00:56:10,208 --> 00:56:12,500
-That's the line for the emergency brakes.
-Hand me a screwdriver.

1247
00:56:12,583 --> 00:56:14,500
That's how we're going to disable them.

1248
00:56:14,583 --> 00:56:15,833
Shinohara, come here, please.

1249
00:56:15,916 --> 00:56:16,750
Okay.

1250
00:56:19,958 --> 00:56:20,541
Okay.

1251
00:56:21,041 --> 00:56:21,875
Here we go…

1252
00:56:23,416 --> 00:56:24,375
Preparations

1253
00:56:24,875 --> 00:56:27,250
for the transfer to the rescue
train are in motion.

1254
00:56:27,333 --> 00:56:28,375
To ensure a smooth
process and avoid accidents,

1255
00:56:28,458 --> 00:56:29,666
I gotta take this at least.

1256
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:31,666
We kindly request that you
leave your baggage behind.

1257
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:33,125
They don't make these anymore.

1258
00:56:33,625 --> 00:56:36,041
-We'll begin the transfer shortly.
-I was saving for so long to get it.

1259
00:56:36,125 --> 00:56:39,625
Seniors aged sixty-five and older, as
well as kids under the age of ten years

1260
00:56:39,708 --> 00:56:41,875
old, will be given
priority during the transfer.

1261
00:56:41,958 --> 00:56:43,208
-"I need it."
-"Please,

1262
00:56:43,291 --> 00:56:44,583
just let me take it. It's no big deal."

1263
00:56:44,666 --> 00:56:46,458
Please head to Car Number Eight in an
orderly manner as soon as you're ready.

1264
00:56:46,541 --> 00:56:47,791
Come on, you heard him leave-- no,
leave it here, leave it here, leave it

1265
00:56:47,875 --> 00:56:49,125
The transfer to the
rescue car will begin shortly.

1266
00:56:49,208 --> 00:56:49,708
Here.

1267
00:56:50,208 --> 00:56:52,208
Only important stuff…
You don't need that!

1268
00:56:52,291 --> 00:56:53,458
To ensure a smooth
process and avoid accidents,

1269
00:56:53,541 --> 00:56:54,458
Only the important stuff!

1270
00:56:54,541 --> 00:56:57,166
We kindly request that you
leave your baggage behind.

1271
00:56:57,250 --> 00:57:00,583
Connect that cable to terminal
B Zero on port seventeen.

1272
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:04,333
Okay.

1273
00:57:05,916 --> 00:57:07,083
NO. 17 TERMINAL

1274
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:08,666
Good!

1275
00:57:09,166 --> 00:57:10,625
It worked, the power's on.

1276
00:57:11,208 --> 00:57:12,041
The final step is:

1277
00:57:12,125 --> 00:57:13,750
disconnect cable number sixteen.

1278
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:15,916
Careful now, Mister Shinohara.

1279
00:57:16,416 --> 00:57:18,791
If you do it wrong,
the emergency brakes will activate.

1280
00:57:18,875 --> 00:57:20,375
We don't want that to happen.

1281
00:57:24,125 --> 00:57:25,458
NO. 16 TERMINAL

1282
00:57:33,625 --> 00:57:35,666
Speed and car status, all clear.

1283
00:57:36,916 --> 00:57:37,625
The brakes

1284
00:57:39,666 --> 00:57:40,750
have been disabled.

1285
00:57:45,166 --> 00:57:46,708
-We did it!
-Great job!

1286
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,166
We just killed the brakes,
no need to cheer.

1287
00:57:51,833 --> 00:57:52,750
It's only the beginning.

1288
00:57:53,708 --> 00:57:55,541
Let's get to the uncoupling process.

1289
00:57:55,625 --> 00:57:57,375
Shinohara,
you handle the cables and connections.

1290
00:57:57,458 --> 00:58:00,291
And Takaichi, you handle the shock
absorber in the conductor's cabin.

1291
00:58:00,375 --> 00:58:01,208
Let's go.

1292
00:58:01,291 --> 00:58:02,208
Yeah.

1293
00:58:03,875 --> 00:58:05,958
-Okay, I'll handle the shock absorber.
-I got it.

1294
00:58:06,041 --> 00:58:06,750
Here we go.

1295
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:07,458
-There it is.
-Got it.

1296
00:58:07,541 --> 00:58:08,625
-I'm holding it.
-Okay, okay.

1297
00:58:08,708 --> 00:58:08,958
Okay.

1298
00:58:09,041 --> 00:58:09,708
That's it.

1299
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:10,708
-I'm passing it.
-Great.

1300
00:58:10,791 --> 00:58:11,541
Yeah, okay.

1301
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,500
Oh, Jesus.

1302
00:58:17,708 --> 00:58:19,500
-Ready, go!
-Ready, go!

1303
00:58:20,375 --> 00:58:21,083
It's off.

1304
00:58:21,166 --> 00:58:21,750
-Give it to me.
-Good.

1305
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:23,083
Next, please.

1306
00:58:25,708 --> 00:58:27,125
-Here.
-Thanks.

1307
00:58:34,625 --> 00:58:36,125
-Be careful, honey!
-I'm going down.

1308
00:58:36,708 --> 00:58:37,750
-Take it easy.
-Okay.

1309
00:58:41,291 --> 00:58:41,833
Here,

1310
00:58:42,333 --> 00:58:43,166
gotcha!

1311
00:58:46,708 --> 00:58:47,583
Less than ten kilometers.

1312
00:58:47,666 --> 00:58:48,500
Five minutes to go.

1313
00:58:59,458 --> 00:59:00,500
Good, you got it out.

1314
00:59:00,583 --> 00:59:01,208
This one, too.

1315
00:59:06,166 --> 00:59:07,375
It's all disconnected.

1316
00:59:09,666 --> 00:59:11,666
Now, we're going to disconnect
the coupler.

1317
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:14,000
-Help me with the decoupling device.
-Okay!

1318
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:14,875
Roger that.

1319
00:59:17,166 --> 00:59:18,000
Done.

1320
00:59:18,541 --> 00:59:21,041
-Put the peaks facing downwards, go.
-Right here, get it in

1321
00:59:21,125 --> 00:59:22,625
-there, there you go.
-Nice!

1322
00:59:22,708 --> 00:59:24,416
Four minutes to the Stock Center.

1323
00:59:27,541 --> 00:59:28,583
-One, two…
-One, two…

1324
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:30,791
-One, two…
-One, two…

1325
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:33,625
-One, two…
-One, two…

1326
00:59:35,666 --> 00:59:36,708
-One, two…
-One, two…

1327
00:59:37,708 --> 00:59:38,916
-One, two…
-One, two…

1328
00:59:42,333 --> 00:59:43,541
You did it!

1329
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:47,666
-Takaichi!
-Oh, watch out!

1330
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:48,666
Takaichi!

1331
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:49,625
Come here.

1332
00:59:49,708 --> 00:59:51,333
-Oh, no!
-Come here quickly! Ahh!

1333
00:59:52,458 --> 00:59:53,375
Car nine is slowing down.

1334
00:59:53,458 --> 00:59:54,541
That means

1335
00:59:54,625 --> 00:59:55,750
the cars are uncoupled.

1336
00:59:55,833 --> 00:59:56,500
-Jump, jump!
-Now!

1337
00:59:56,583 --> 00:59:57,291
-Takaichi!
-Hurry!

1338
00:59:57,375 --> 00:59:58,250
"Come on!"

1339
00:59:58,333 --> 00:59:59,625
-I gotcha!
-Are you okay?

1340
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:26,708
How's the power?

1341
01:00:26,791 --> 01:00:27,875
Still working, sir.

1342
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:29,666
So the bomb in car four wasn't
the only one after all.

1343
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:30,791
Call the Stock Center.

1344
01:00:30,875 --> 01:00:32,333
Itsuki, the train!

1345
01:00:32,833 --> 01:00:33,833
Transport dispatcher to

1346
01:00:33,916 --> 01:00:34,708
ninety fourteen B,

1347
01:00:34,791 --> 01:00:35,708
you are clear to depart.

1348
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:37,541
ATC disabled.

1349
01:00:37,625 --> 01:00:38,333
Check.

1350
01:00:38,958 --> 01:00:40,541
Reverser, check.

1351
01:00:41,208 --> 01:00:43,291
Rescue train ninety fourteen B, departing.

1352
01:00:46,833 --> 01:00:49,333
FIRST-LINE MANAGER,
THE STOCK CENTER

1353
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:53,958
The rescue train is leaving
the stock center.

1354
01:00:54,041 --> 01:00:55,500
It's heading towards Tokyo.

1355
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,791
Speed is increasing. Wind pressure's fine.

1356
01:00:58,291 --> 01:01:00,000
You're in the clear to keep going.

1357
01:01:00,083 --> 01:01:00,541
Roger.

1358
01:01:01,041 --> 01:01:01,833
To the rescue team,

1359
01:01:02,333 --> 01:01:04,291
stay sharp out there. No reckless moves.

1360
01:01:04,375 --> 01:01:05,291
Copy that.

1361
01:01:05,375 --> 01:01:08,333
This is Mukai, in charge of Omiya-dai.
I'll take it from here.

1362
01:01:08,416 --> 01:01:09,333
Roger that.

1363
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:11,833
The rescue train

1364
01:01:11,916 --> 01:01:14,083
is about to enter the main line.

1365
01:01:17,125 --> 01:01:19,208
Fifty sixty B is running on the main line.

1366
01:01:20,166 --> 01:01:21,500
Fifty sixty B is in sight.

1367
01:01:22,083 --> 01:01:22,875
We're catching up.

1368
01:01:23,375 --> 01:01:27,166
Wait until you pass Sendai Station,
and then get close to the Fifty sixty B.

1369
01:01:29,208 --> 01:01:33,125
We're coming to you live from
a rooftop near Sendai Station.

1370
01:01:33,208 --> 01:01:35,000
At this moment, the
Tohoku Shinkansen lines…

1371
01:01:35,083 --> 01:01:35,791
Hey,

1372
01:01:35,875 --> 01:01:36,458
there it is.

1373
01:01:36,541 --> 01:01:37,000
Ah,

1374
01:01:37,083 --> 01:01:37,416
it's here!

1375
01:01:37,916 --> 01:01:38,625
The Hayabusa Sixty!

1376
01:01:39,125 --> 01:01:41,208
The Hayabusa Sixty, with bombs reportedly
planted on board, is now passing in front

1377
01:01:41,291 --> 01:01:41,875
of Sendai Station

1378
01:01:42,375 --> 01:01:43,583
It's the Hayabusa Sixty. It's still
running nonstop at over one hundred

1379
01:01:43,666 --> 01:01:44,666
kilometers per hour.

1380
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:46,500
-And… Oh,
-Another Shinkansen train is running

1381
01:01:46,583 --> 01:01:48,125
right behind it, practically chasing the
Hayabusa Sixty.

1382
01:01:48,208 --> 01:01:49,666
Another Shinkansen train is
running on the same track.

1383
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:51,000
It looks like it's going backwards,

1384
01:01:51,083 --> 01:01:53,000
and apparently faster
than the fifty sixty B.

1385
01:01:53,083 --> 01:01:55,166
It's almost catching up
to the Hayabusa Sixty!

1386
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:58,875
Fifty sixty B has passed
through the Shiga Tunnel.

1387
01:01:58,958 --> 01:02:00,000
This is Fifty sixty B.

1388
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:01,500
Right now,

1389
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,041
I'm still fixed at one twenty.

1390
01:02:03,125 --> 01:02:04,708
I'm at one hundred thirty
kilometers per hour.

1391
01:02:04,791 --> 01:02:05,916
I'll slow down now.

1392
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:15,916
Uhh-

1393
01:02:16,416 --> 01:02:17,750
The distance, about sixty meters.

1394
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:19,583
Fifty.

1395
01:02:20,916 --> 01:02:21,791
Fourty.

1396
01:02:23,458 --> 01:02:24,333
Thirty.

1397
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:26,791
Twenty-five.

1398
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:32,416
This is the rescue train,
we slowed down to one twenty one.

1399
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:34,958
Get ready to link up soon.

1400
01:02:35,583 --> 01:02:36,583
The pipes are ready!

1401
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,125
The footplate is unlocked!

1402
01:02:39,208 --> 01:02:40,125
Get ready, everyone!

1403
01:02:40,208 --> 01:02:41,875
I'm gonna start measuring the distance.

1404
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:42,666
Watch the winds!

1405
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:47,916
Taking off the shield!

1406
01:02:48,416 --> 01:02:49,500
I'm going to the edge.

1407
01:02:51,291 --> 01:02:52,291
Hold it!

1408
01:02:53,166 --> 01:02:53,708
I got him!

1409
01:02:54,291 --> 01:02:55,041
Okay, got it!

1410
01:03:03,916 --> 01:03:05,041
Ten meters to go.

1411
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:07,583
Eight.

1412
01:03:08,458 --> 01:03:09,000
Seven.

1413
01:03:10,375 --> 01:03:11,208
Six.

1414
01:03:11,875 --> 01:03:12,708
Five.

1415
01:03:13,291 --> 01:03:14,250
Lift the footplate!

1416
01:03:14,333 --> 01:03:15,208
-Four.
-Got it.

1417
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:16,250
-There.
-Three.

1418
01:03:16,333 --> 01:03:17,208
Slowly let it go.

1419
01:03:17,291 --> 01:03:18,458
Slowly, slowly!

1420
01:03:18,541 --> 01:03:19,208
-Slower!
-Keep the tension!

1421
01:03:19,291 --> 01:03:20,000
Slower!

1422
01:03:20,083 --> 01:03:21,041
-Come on, hold it!
-Two.

1423
01:03:21,125 --> 01:03:22,291
Slower! Slower!

1424
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:24,000
One.

1425
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:26,333
-Yes, we got it!
-We're holding it!

1426
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:29,333
Zero!

1427
01:03:29,833 --> 01:03:30,666
Great!

1428
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:31,791
We did it!

1429
01:03:32,666 --> 01:03:33,666
-"We did it!"
-They're connected!

1430
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:35,708
-Great!
-Get the ropes ready.

1431
01:03:36,666 --> 01:03:37,708
Let's get started.

1432
01:03:38,333 --> 01:03:39,041
Okay.

1433
01:03:41,333 --> 01:03:44,583
The distance between the ninety fourteen B
and the Hayabusa sixty is

1434
01:03:45,875 --> 01:03:46,708
zero.

1435
01:03:49,833 --> 01:03:50,708
We did it!

1436
01:03:50,791 --> 01:03:52,333
You're all doing a great job!

1437
01:03:53,833 --> 01:03:55,250
Yeah and we're just getting started.

1438
01:03:55,333 --> 01:03:56,333
Let's keep going.

1439
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:57,041
Sure!

1440
01:03:57,541 --> 01:03:58,458
Give them the hooks first.

1441
01:03:58,541 --> 01:03:59,375
-Be careful, okay?
-Sure.

1442
01:03:59,458 --> 01:04:00,291
Here,

1443
01:04:00,916 --> 01:04:01,666
-take this hook.
-Hold it.

1444
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:02,500
-Here, a hook.
-Here. Take it. Hold that.

1445
01:04:02,583 --> 01:04:03,208
Okay, I got it.

1446
01:04:03,291 --> 01:04:04,166
-I'm ready over here!
-Next one.

1447
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:05,250
-Okay, go ahead.
-I got it.

1448
01:04:05,333 --> 01:04:05,916
Great.

1449
01:04:06,416 --> 01:04:07,208
-Okay, one more coming.
-Keep passing them!

1450
01:04:07,291 --> 01:04:07,625
Thank you.

1451
01:04:07,708 --> 01:04:08,250
And the ropes.

1452
01:04:08,333 --> 01:04:09,500
-Pass it!
-Tie it over there.

1453
01:04:09,583 --> 01:04:09,958
Pass it to me.

1454
01:04:10,458 --> 01:04:11,333
-The pipes!
-Okay!

1455
01:04:11,416 --> 01:04:13,416
-Insert them into there.
-I'll tie it up.

1456
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:15,208
This one's all set, we got it!

1457
01:04:15,708 --> 01:04:16,708
Let's get them all through!

1458
01:04:16,791 --> 01:04:18,375
-Yeah!
-Excuse me,

1459
01:04:18,458 --> 01:04:19,083
coming through.

1460
01:04:19,583 --> 01:04:20,458
Sorry.

1461
01:04:20,958 --> 01:04:22,041
Let's go! Now!

1462
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:23,000
Okay, time to go!

1463
01:04:23,083 --> 01:04:24,916
One at time, alright?

1464
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Okay,

1465
01:04:26,541 --> 01:04:27,708
take it easy, don't rush.

1466
01:04:27,791 --> 01:04:29,875
-Make sure you hold onto the ropes.
-Okay!

1467
01:04:32,458 --> 01:04:33,333
Watch your step.

1468
01:04:33,916 --> 01:04:35,583
-Hold on to the ropes!
-Slowly.

1469
01:04:36,083 --> 01:04:38,125
Okay, come over here,
sweetie. You're doing great. Come on.

1470
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:40,333
There's room for everyone,
okay? No need to rush.

1471
01:04:40,916 --> 01:04:42,625
-Women and children first.
-Let them through!

1472
01:04:42,708 --> 01:04:44,375
-Make sure you hold onto the ropes!
-Okay, stay calm. Don't worry.

1473
01:04:44,458 --> 01:04:45,708
Hey, wait.

1474
01:04:46,333 --> 01:04:47,541
Wait! It's scary, I just need a
hand! Keep holding onto the rails!

1475
01:04:47,625 --> 01:04:48,458
-Come here.
-Hey, don't-- don't grab--

1476
01:04:48,541 --> 01:04:49,208
-don't grab me, what are you doing?
-Thank you.

1477
01:04:49,291 --> 01:04:50,291
Wait for me! Hey I said wait!

1478
01:04:50,375 --> 01:04:51,291
Stay calm!

1479
01:04:51,375 --> 01:04:54,583
-Don't rush, take it easy, go slow.
-Don't look down.

1480
01:04:54,666 --> 01:04:57,250
-I can't. I-- I-- I don't wanna die.
-You just have to walk.

1481
01:04:57,333 --> 01:05:00,166
-Make sure you hold onto the ropes!
-Right now? Seriously?

1482
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:02,208
-Don't look down.
-Keep going, please.

1483
01:05:02,291 --> 01:05:03,666
-Move into the train!
-Okay, come on.

1484
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:05,000
-Take your time!
-Okay,

1485
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:06,375
walk slowly.

1486
01:05:06,875 --> 01:05:08,250
-Make sure you hold onto the ropes!
-Hold onto the ropes.

1487
01:05:08,333 --> 01:05:09,708
Here. Good!

1488
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:18,083
Two hundred passengers

1489
01:05:18,166 --> 01:05:19,750
are already on the rescue train.

1490
01:05:21,416 --> 01:05:23,083
We just have to keep up that pace.

1491
01:05:26,708 --> 01:05:29,083
This is a special
Tohoku-shinkansen rescue train.

1492
01:05:29,166 --> 01:05:31,083
I guess this website

1493
01:05:31,166 --> 01:05:33,041
Once all the passengers have transfered
into this train, we will uncouple from the

1494
01:05:33,125 --> 01:05:34,750
Hayabusa Sixty and
return to Sendai Station.

1495
01:05:34,833 --> 01:05:36,958
-Is useless now, huh? Well…
-I guess it was more useful than

1496
01:05:37,041 --> 01:05:38,250
what the politicians did?

1497
01:05:38,333 --> 01:05:41,333
Since many passengers will be moving,
please fill every seat, starting from Car

1498
01:05:41,416 --> 01:05:42,666
Number Ten at the rear of the train.

1499
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:45,500
Miss Kagami. I got a text from Chief
Secretary Suwa with some very kind words,

1500
01:05:45,583 --> 01:05:46,458
did you get it too?

1501
01:05:46,541 --> 01:05:48,958
-Let me see.
-To keep things moving smoothly,

1502
01:05:49,041 --> 01:05:50,208
I'm glad you're safe, Kagami. Your
presence on the Hayabusa Sixty helped tone

1503
01:05:50,291 --> 01:05:52,708
-avoid stopping in the gangways or aisles.
-Sure.

1504
01:05:54,291 --> 01:05:57,458
Down the public's
criticism of the government.

1505
01:05:57,541 --> 01:06:00,541
-Amazing, isn't it?
-You cunning old man.

1506
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:07,000
Coming through! Please make
way, we're coming through!

1507
01:06:07,083 --> 01:06:08,083
What's wrong?

1508
01:06:08,583 --> 01:06:09,625
What happened?

1509
01:06:09,708 --> 01:06:11,375
That helicopter guy did this.

1510
01:06:11,875 --> 01:06:13,000
-I'm dying.
-We were trying to help him

1511
01:06:13,083 --> 01:06:14,041
cross, but he got a golf club

1512
01:06:14,125 --> 01:06:15,500
and hit him in the face with it.

1513
01:06:15,583 --> 01:06:16,791
-Come on, don't hit me dude.
-Oh, sorry.

1514
01:06:16,875 --> 01:06:17,708
Hey,

1515
01:06:18,291 --> 01:06:19,375
calm down!

1516
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:22,333
Stop!

1517
01:06:23,708 --> 01:06:24,750
Calm down, sir.

1518
01:06:26,333 --> 01:06:27,250
I want to die!

1519
01:06:27,333 --> 01:06:28,333
This is my chance!

1520
01:06:28,833 --> 01:06:30,166
Just let me die!

1521
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:32,291
-Miss Ichikawa.
-Huh?

1522
01:06:32,375 --> 01:06:33,625
-Yuzuki isn't here.
-Please remain seated until

1523
01:06:33,708 --> 01:06:35,916
-all passengers are aboard.
-She isn't?! Since when?

1524
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:36,833
I don't know.

1525
01:06:37,333 --> 01:06:39,666
-I'll go find her, ok?
-Uh-huh.

1526
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:41,291
-You wait here.
-Okay.

1527
01:06:41,375 --> 01:06:42,166
Stay seated!

1528
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:43,333
Yuzuki.

1529
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:50,083
-I hope she's not having an attack.
-Wa-Wait. Hey! Hang on!

1530
01:06:50,583 --> 01:06:52,458
The Sugar Mama politician went too.

1531
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:56,500
To keep things moving smoothly,
avoid stopping in the gangways or aisles.

1532
01:06:56,583 --> 01:06:57,166
She's a hero.

1533
01:06:57,666 --> 01:06:59,791
Please remain seated until
all passengers are aboard.

1534
01:06:59,875 --> 01:07:01,458
Oh! You're going too, Todoroki?

1535
01:07:02,041 --> 01:07:02,750
Huh?

1536
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:05,583
It won't be long before all
passengers from the Hayabusa Sixty are

1537
01:07:05,666 --> 01:07:07,500
-safely transferred.
-Huh? Huh? What?

1538
01:07:08,666 --> 01:07:11,833
Once all the passengers have transfered
into this train, we will uncouple from the

1539
01:07:11,916 --> 01:07:13,625
Hayabusa Sixty and
return to Sendai Station.

1540
01:07:13,708 --> 01:07:15,208
Good for you, Mister Todoroki.

1541
01:07:15,916 --> 01:07:16,791
You're very brave.

1542
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:21,541
-Excuse me.
-Oh!

1543
01:07:22,041 --> 01:07:23,083
-I'm just--
-It's dangerous!

1544
01:07:23,166 --> 01:07:24,166
Don't go back!

1545
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:25,750
-My student's there!
-We're about to disconnect the car.

1546
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:27,291
It's dangerous, get back here!

1547
01:07:27,375 --> 01:07:29,708
No! Hey, I'm telling you it's dangerous!

1548
01:07:29,791 --> 01:07:31,166
-Hey!
-Let me die, please!

1549
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:32,166
I beg you!

1550
01:07:33,166 --> 01:07:34,000
Get off me!

1551
01:07:34,916 --> 01:07:36,791
You should've heard what they all said.

1552
01:07:36,875 --> 01:07:38,375
-Hey, wait.
-The victim's families want me

1553
01:07:38,458 --> 01:07:40,500
-to die, I'm better off dead!
-Listen. Calm down!

1554
01:07:40,583 --> 01:07:41,791
I wanna die!

1555
01:07:42,583 --> 01:07:43,500
Stop this nonsense!

1556
01:07:46,291 --> 01:07:47,291
Stop this right now.

1557
01:07:48,375 --> 01:07:50,583
You just don't know when to give up,
do you?

1558
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:52,208
Shut your mouth, you bitch!

1559
01:07:52,916 --> 01:07:53,833
You know what?

1560
01:07:53,916 --> 01:07:55,333
That accident was all your fault.

1561
01:07:55,416 --> 01:07:56,416
You politicians

1562
01:07:56,916 --> 01:07:59,666
and your regulations and laws
that screw us business owners!

1563
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:02,666
Blaming politics for everything.
You're a coward!

1564
01:08:03,291 --> 01:08:05,333
I'm sick of you complaining
about this shit.

1565
01:08:05,833 --> 01:08:08,750
If you were a real man,
you'd know how to tough it out!

1566
01:08:16,416 --> 01:08:17,291
Anyway…

1567
01:08:19,083 --> 01:08:20,333
you can still start over.

1568
01:08:23,166 --> 01:08:24,833
I know how ruthless people can be.

1569
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,250
I know that all too well.

1570
01:08:29,083 --> 01:08:30,416
If you give it enough time,

1571
01:08:30,916 --> 01:08:32,458
people will forget any scandal.

1572
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:34,541
Even someone like me…

1573
01:08:35,666 --> 01:08:37,791
I'm sure people will vote for me again.

1574
01:08:59,416 --> 01:09:00,250
One seventeen…

1575
01:09:00,958 --> 01:09:02,625
One sixteen… The speed is…

1576
01:09:02,708 --> 01:09:03,375
decreasing!

1577
01:09:03,958 --> 01:09:04,583
Is the ATC on?

1578
01:09:05,166 --> 01:09:07,291
-It's not, it's still disabled!
-It's Ninety fourteen B!

1579
01:09:07,375 --> 01:09:09,375
The rescue train's emergency brakes are

1580
01:09:09,458 --> 01:09:10,166
working.

1581
01:09:14,666 --> 01:09:15,666
-Sorry,
-Are you okay?

1582
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:17,291
Sorry. Excuse me.

1583
01:09:17,916 --> 01:09:18,750
Ma'am!

1584
01:09:19,291 --> 01:09:20,750
I have to find Yuzuki.

1585
01:09:21,375 --> 01:09:22,041
Fujii,

1586
01:09:22,541 --> 01:09:24,208
-take them to the rescue train.
-Got it.

1587
01:09:25,833 --> 01:09:26,666
Let's get you up, now.

1588
01:09:27,166 --> 01:09:28,541
What? Hey,

1589
01:09:29,083 --> 01:09:30,000
they need help.

1590
01:09:32,541 --> 01:09:33,375
-Thank you so much.
-No problem.

1591
01:09:33,458 --> 01:09:34,333
Watch out.

1592
01:09:34,416 --> 01:09:35,416
Follow me, this way!

1593
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,083
Let's go, Miss Kagami.

1594
01:09:38,291 --> 01:09:39,125
Oh!

1595
01:09:39,666 --> 01:09:40,833
What are you doing here?

1596
01:09:41,375 --> 01:09:42,375
I don't know, actually.

1597
01:09:42,458 --> 01:09:43,708
-What?
-Hey. Let's-- Let's go, come on.

1598
01:09:43,791 --> 01:09:45,000
-This is bad.
-Okay.

1599
01:09:45,083 --> 01:09:45,750
Here.

1600
01:09:45,833 --> 01:09:46,875
I really don't.

1601
01:09:46,958 --> 01:09:47,875
The brakes.

1602
01:09:48,375 --> 01:09:49,583
Can you disable them?

1603
01:09:51,750 --> 01:09:52,583
I can't!

1604
01:09:55,416 --> 01:09:56,291
Please!

1605
01:09:58,916 --> 01:10:01,291
-Oh, no!
-We have to uncouple it right now!

1606
01:10:03,041 --> 01:10:03,916
Can you…

1607
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,041
Can you remove it?

1608
01:10:06,458 --> 01:10:07,083
Oh, look out!

1609
01:10:07,666 --> 01:10:08,708
-Are you okay?
-Careful.

1610
01:10:09,208 --> 01:10:10,625
-Careful, Totsuka.
-I can't remove the

1611
01:10:10,708 --> 01:10:12,125
wires, they got entangled!

1612
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:17,666
A little more.

1613
01:10:18,166 --> 01:10:19,125
We're almost there.

1614
01:10:22,916 --> 01:10:23,833
What is this?!

1615
01:10:25,125 --> 01:10:25,708
Why?

1616
01:10:26,208 --> 01:10:27,125
Why?!

1617
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:29,958
Step back! It's too dangerous!

1618
01:10:30,541 --> 01:10:31,375
-Move back!
-Whoa!

1619
01:10:31,458 --> 01:10:32,458
You can't use this.

1620
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,083
"It's too dangerous!"

1621
01:10:34,166 --> 01:10:35,833
It's dangerous, you could die!

1622
01:10:36,708 --> 01:10:37,541
Step back!

1623
01:10:38,125 --> 01:10:39,458
Totsuka, get outta there!

1624
01:10:39,541 --> 01:10:41,333
-It's too dangerous!
-If it keeps slowing down like this,

1625
01:10:41,416 --> 01:10:42,833
both trains will suffer from the
explosion!

1626
01:10:42,916 --> 01:10:45,708
We didn't evacuate passengers
to this train for nothing!

1627
01:10:55,083 --> 01:10:57,625
-It's going to crash! Get inside!
-Look out!

1628
01:11:07,291 --> 01:11:08,583
-Bring him in!
-Come on!

1629
01:11:08,666 --> 01:11:09,125
Come on!

1630
01:11:09,625 --> 01:11:10,625
-Come on!
-Hurry up!

1631
01:11:16,375 --> 01:11:17,250
Are you all right?

1632
01:11:17,333 --> 01:11:18,333
Yeah, thanks.

1633
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:20,375
Was that an explosion just now?

1634
01:11:20,458 --> 01:11:21,375
No.

1635
01:11:21,958 --> 01:11:22,875
An explosion would've

1636
01:11:22,958 --> 01:11:23,875
derailed the train.

1637
01:11:28,166 --> 01:11:29,000
TSUTOMU ONODERA

1638
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:30,666
Yuzuki!

1639
01:11:32,791 --> 01:11:33,791
What were you doing?

1640
01:11:34,583 --> 01:11:36,041
Everyone's in the rescue train.

1641
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:38,250
-Let's just go to the back for now.
-Okay.

1642
01:11:48,458 --> 01:11:49,291
Oh…

1643
01:11:50,458 --> 01:11:52,166
-Here.
-Thanks.

1644
01:11:57,250 --> 01:11:58,083
Fujii…

1645
01:12:07,833 --> 01:12:08,541
No…

1646
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:18,541
No way…

1647
01:12:38,791 --> 01:12:40,166
SHIROISHI 2

1648
01:12:42,125 --> 01:12:42,791
SHIGA

1649
01:12:43,291 --> 01:12:45,000
SHIROISHI-ZAO

1650
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:47,916
Fifty sixty B's back to seventy five.

1651
01:12:49,375 --> 01:12:51,875
The rescue train's running
without problems, sir.

1652
01:12:57,333 --> 01:12:59,333
According to the report
from Ninety fourteen B,

1653
01:12:59,416 --> 01:13:01,166
we rescued three hundred and forty people.

1654
01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:02,166
One crew member

1655
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:05,083
and three hundred and thirty
nine passengers, commander.

1656
01:13:05,166 --> 01:13:06,250
The remaining

1657
01:13:06,333 --> 01:13:07,333
nine people,

1658
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:08,416
are three

1659
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:09,458
crew members

1660
01:13:09,541 --> 01:13:11,708
-and six passengers.
-Yes!

1661
01:13:12,583 --> 01:13:13,791
We did it!

1662
01:13:14,666 --> 01:13:16,500
We just have to do the same thing again!

1663
01:13:16,583 --> 01:13:17,500
Unfortunately,

1664
01:13:18,166 --> 01:13:20,958
we can't bypass the circuit twice,
the train's not built for that.

1665
01:13:21,041 --> 01:13:23,583
So it's impossible to run
the same operation again.

1666
01:13:29,833 --> 01:13:32,416
-Can't you make it work come on?!
-Even if we could,

1667
01:13:33,333 --> 01:13:36,250
we don't have enough time to
repeat the same operation now.

1668
01:13:39,208 --> 01:13:42,125
I need an estimate of the damages
if it explodes in the urban area!

1669
01:13:42,208 --> 01:13:46,250
Assuming an explosion as big as the one
we saw were to happen on every train car,

1670
01:13:46,875 --> 01:13:47,791
they would derail,

1671
01:13:48,416 --> 01:13:51,958
and it's likely that many of the cars
would break through the barriers…

1672
01:13:52,958 --> 01:13:55,125
We know for sure the damage
will be massive.

1673
01:13:56,916 --> 01:13:58,583
Tokyo Station's in the
heart of the capital

1674
01:13:58,666 --> 01:14:00,541
the whole city would suffer immensely.

1675
01:14:11,166 --> 01:14:13,791
SHIROISHI-ZAO STATION

1676
01:14:17,666 --> 01:14:19,541
286 KM TO TOKYO

1677
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:36,583
Hey.

1678
01:14:37,083 --> 01:14:37,958
What are we gonna do now?

1679
01:14:38,458 --> 01:14:40,333
Do they have another plan? Do you know?

1680
01:14:40,416 --> 01:14:41,208
No one called me yet.

1681
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:45,916
And what about the bomber?

1682
01:14:46,416 --> 01:14:48,791
Apparently,
they haven't called in the past two hours.

1683
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:54,375
It's

1684
01:14:54,875 --> 01:14:55,916
not going up at anymore.

1685
01:14:58,291 --> 01:14:59,791
It's not really my fault, you know?

1686
01:15:00,416 --> 01:15:02,500
I mean,
there are only nine of us left, right?

1687
01:15:02,583 --> 01:15:05,125
No one else is gonna bother
to donate anything now.

1688
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:08,416
What if…

1689
01:15:09,125 --> 01:15:10,750
they end up running out of ideas?

1690
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,458
Well, I'll tell you one thing,
for the government…

1691
01:15:16,541 --> 01:15:18,375
if there's no chance of
disarming the bombs,

1692
01:15:18,458 --> 01:15:21,250
then letting this train reach
Tokyo Station is not an option.

1693
01:15:21,333 --> 01:15:22,250
That's for sure.

1694
01:15:22,916 --> 01:15:23,750
What?

1695
01:15:25,250 --> 01:15:27,791
Can you imagine the damage if
it explodes at Tokyo Station?

1696
01:15:28,291 --> 01:15:29,750
They'll never let that happen.

1697
01:15:29,833 --> 01:15:31,666
W-- w- w- wait, d- d- do you mean that…

1698
01:15:32,166 --> 01:15:34,500
they might force this train to stop
before it reaches Tokyo Station?

1699
01:15:34,583 --> 01:15:35,875
Is that wh- what you're --?

1700
01:15:35,958 --> 01:15:37,166
I'm sure there's still

1701
01:15:37,250 --> 01:15:38,750
something that can be done.

1702
01:15:40,333 --> 01:15:41,958
We just need to find some kind of

1703
01:15:42,041 --> 01:15:43,291
synergy to make it work.

1704
01:15:43,958 --> 01:15:44,666
Right?

1705
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:47,541
You know what? To hell with synergy.

1706
01:15:47,625 --> 01:15:48,541
Huh?

1707
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:50,291
-Um…
-Take it easy.

1708
01:15:50,375 --> 01:15:51,333
Can they

1709
01:15:51,416 --> 01:15:52,250
really do that?

1710
01:15:53,083 --> 01:15:53,958
Forcing this

1711
01:15:54,041 --> 01:15:55,333
train to stop, is that--

1712
01:15:56,333 --> 01:15:57,083
Is that even…?

1713
01:15:58,416 --> 01:15:59,333
Takaichi.

1714
01:16:01,708 --> 01:16:02,666
Technically speaking…

1715
01:16:03,166 --> 01:16:04,000
they can.

1716
01:16:05,375 --> 01:16:06,333
But don't worry about it.

1717
01:16:06,416 --> 01:16:07,833
They're doing their best to--

1718
01:16:08,791 --> 01:16:09,500
I'll be right back.

1719
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,250
I'm gonna go call my dad.

1720
01:16:26,583 --> 01:16:28,875
She's a kid,
look at her. We can't let her die.

1721
01:16:28,958 --> 01:16:31,750
If only we could keep running
through and not stop at Tokyo Station…

1722
01:16:31,833 --> 01:16:33,916
That's impossible. You
know that, don't you?

1723
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,958
It's the end of the line,
the train has to stop.

1724
01:16:36,041 --> 01:16:37,083
I mean, it's a given.

1725
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:38,583
Mhm.

1726
01:16:43,416 --> 01:16:44,958
TOKYO STATION

1727
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:52,166
TO TOWNS AND TO PEOPLE.
WHOOSH, WE CONNECT!

1728
01:16:52,666 --> 01:16:54,333
But what if they're connected?

1729
01:16:57,541 --> 01:17:01,166
KUNIMI TOWN, DATE DISTRICT,
FUKUSHIMA PREFECTURE 269 KM TO TOKYO

1730
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:03,125
We have two and a half hours.

1731
01:17:03,208 --> 01:17:04,208
Are you implying

1732
01:17:04,291 --> 01:17:06,125
that there's a chance you'll resort to

1733
01:17:06,208 --> 01:17:07,875
your alternative plan if we don't

1734
01:17:07,958 --> 01:17:08,833
think of anything else?

1735
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:10,375
Alternative plan?

1736
01:17:12,125 --> 01:17:13,041
You mean…

1737
01:17:13,833 --> 01:17:14,875
you're thinking of stopping

1738
01:17:15,375 --> 01:17:16,500
the Fifty sixty B?

1739
01:17:19,250 --> 01:17:20,375
There are crew members…

1740
01:17:21,083 --> 01:17:22,916
passengers inside that train,
and they need us!

1741
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,500
I get how you feel, I mean it.

1742
01:17:25,125 --> 01:17:28,125
But there are literally millions of people
who depend on the Shinkansen trains

1743
01:17:28,208 --> 01:17:29,083
to work.

1744
01:17:29,166 --> 01:17:31,166
This is politics, we act fast and
not stall until the worst happens. You

1745
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:33,500
-understand?!
-How dare you treat human lives like that!

1746
01:17:33,583 --> 01:17:34,458
What is going on here.

1747
01:17:34,958 --> 01:17:36,250
You're all talk, but
you clearly don't care.

1748
01:17:36,333 --> 01:17:37,208
Don't do that!

1749
01:17:37,291 --> 01:17:38,583
-These are real lives!
-Calm down,

1750
01:17:38,666 --> 01:17:39,625
-calm down!
-You think it's easy for me?

1751
01:17:39,708 --> 01:17:40,125
Stop!

1752
01:17:40,625 --> 01:17:41,208
-Huh?
-Stop,

1753
01:17:41,708 --> 01:17:42,416
stop!

1754
01:17:43,333 --> 01:17:44,208
Transport Dispat--

1755
01:17:45,208 --> 01:17:46,083
General Commander.

1756
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:49,708
It's the conductor on Fifty sixty B.

1757
01:17:54,541 --> 01:17:55,458
This is Kasagi.

1758
01:17:57,541 --> 01:17:58,375
Huh?

1759
01:18:05,375 --> 01:18:08,666
You wanna connect the train directly
to the Tokaido Shinkansen line?

1760
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:10,083
Wait you're saying the tracks…

1761
01:18:10,166 --> 01:18:13,083
-aren't actually connected.
-The Tohoku-shinkansen and the Tokaido

1762
01:18:13,166 --> 01:18:16,500
Shinkansen lines are only about five
meters apart at Tokyo Station.

1763
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:19,125
I we connect those railroads,

1764
01:18:19,208 --> 01:18:22,208
we can keep the fifty sixty B running
to Kagoshima-Chuo station.

1765
01:18:27,375 --> 01:18:29,541
We can still make it if
we start right away.

1766
01:18:30,041 --> 01:18:31,208
We need your permission.

1767
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:34,416
Two and a half hours to go, huh?

1768
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:35,375
Sasaki.

1769
01:18:36,583 --> 01:18:37,583
Please let us do it!

1770
01:18:50,416 --> 01:18:52,000
Make sure you finish it in time.

1771
01:18:52,666 --> 01:18:54,416
I'll figure out how to get a permit.

1772
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:55,041
Thank you!

1773
01:18:56,708 --> 01:18:58,916
Let's see if we can provide an
E-seven-type train compatible with fifties

1774
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,250
-and sixties.
-Let's get a track

1775
01:19:00,333 --> 01:19:01,458
-maintenance vehicle out!
-Copy that, sir!

1776
01:19:01,541 --> 01:19:03,333
Tokyo-dai,
connect with the Tokyo Stock Center.

1777
01:19:03,416 --> 01:19:05,125
Omiya-dai,
connect with the Omiya Tech Center.

1778
01:19:05,208 --> 01:19:06,416
Set up a joint task force!

1779
01:19:07,458 --> 01:19:09,541
Breaking news on the Hayabusa Sixty case.

1780
01:19:10,666 --> 01:19:14,458
Cars nine and ten have exploded near
Rifu Town in Miyagi District.

1781
01:19:15,041 --> 01:19:16,375
Fortunately, there were no passengers

1782
01:19:16,458 --> 01:19:17,708
nor crew members onboard.

1783
01:19:18,708 --> 01:19:21,041
No injuries have been reported
among passengers

1784
01:19:21,125 --> 01:19:23,041
or local residents so far.

1785
01:19:24,250 --> 01:19:25,041
I repeat.

1786
01:19:25,958 --> 01:19:28,375
Cars nine and ten have exploded,
but fortunately

1787
01:19:28,458 --> 01:19:31,083
there were no passengers
or crew members onboard.

1788
01:19:32,083 --> 01:19:34,750
No injuries have been reported
among passengers or local residents.

1789
01:19:34,833 --> 01:19:36,708
Yuzuki. Do you know how
many times I called you?

1790
01:19:36,791 --> 01:19:37,625
Oh my.

1791
01:19:38,125 --> 01:19:40,208
-This is still "so scary for all of us"--
-I'm very sorry,

1792
01:19:40,291 --> 01:19:41,125
Dad.

1793
01:19:42,541 --> 01:19:43,375
So, uh…

1794
01:19:43,458 --> 01:19:44,541
Are you on board

1795
01:19:44,625 --> 01:19:45,500
Number Sixty?

1796
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:47,833
Yes.

1797
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:49,416
Yes, I am.

1798
01:19:49,916 --> 01:19:50,583
I thought so…

1799
01:19:51,958 --> 01:19:52,625
Are you hurt?

1800
01:19:53,125 --> 01:19:54,250
Are you okay?

1801
01:19:55,666 --> 01:19:56,250
Mhm.

1802
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:57,500
It's all good.

1803
01:19:58,541 --> 01:19:59,375
What?

1804
01:20:02,791 --> 01:20:03,875
What do you mean "all good"?

1805
01:20:04,375 --> 01:20:05,333
Yes.

1806
01:20:05,416 --> 01:20:06,625
Thank you, I'm okay.

1807
01:20:07,666 --> 01:20:08,500
Dad.

1808
01:20:11,375 --> 01:20:12,000
Yes.

1809
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:13,625
Thank you, I'm okay.

1810
01:20:17,833 --> 01:20:18,583
Yuzuki.

1811
01:20:21,625 --> 01:20:22,625
I know what this is.

1812
01:20:24,416 --> 01:20:25,375
This is revenge.

1813
01:20:26,458 --> 01:20:29,291
Whoever was left from back then
must've found new allies

1814
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:32,208
and they're out for revenge on me.

1815
01:20:33,375 --> 01:20:34,208
Those jerks.

1816
01:20:34,916 --> 01:20:36,000
To hell with them.

1817
01:20:36,625 --> 01:20:38,666
I'm gonna find every last one of them and

1818
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:40,291
kill them all, I'm telling you!

1819
01:20:44,833 --> 01:20:46,083
Never gonna happen, dude.

1820
01:20:47,291 --> 01:20:48,125
What?

1821
01:20:48,916 --> 01:20:50,125
What did you say to me?

1822
01:20:53,708 --> 01:20:54,583
I said…

1823
01:20:55,916 --> 01:20:56,833
it's never gonna happen.

1824
01:20:58,583 --> 01:21:00,625
An old fart like you, killing the bomber?

1825
01:21:02,125 --> 01:21:02,791
No way in hell.

1826
01:21:05,041 --> 01:21:05,708
You

1827
01:21:05,791 --> 01:21:06,250
just

1828
01:21:06,333 --> 01:21:06,875
called me--

1829
01:21:07,666 --> 01:21:09,291
Did you forget that I'm your father?

1830
01:21:09,375 --> 01:21:11,208
-You show me some respect!
-You'll never kill the

1831
01:21:11,291 --> 01:21:12,458
bomber, and you know it.

1832
01:21:13,791 --> 01:21:15,208
'Cause you know what?

1833
01:21:17,333 --> 01:21:18,250
Truth is

1834
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:19,958
I'm the bomber.

1835
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:21,250
What?

1836
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,375
I guess you don't wanna believe
thats true, do you?

1837
01:21:31,208 --> 01:21:32,000
I did it.

1838
01:21:34,666 --> 01:21:35,666
I planted the bombs.

1839
01:21:36,916 --> 01:21:39,583
I've been hearing you brag nonstop
for years about how "put a bullet in

1840
01:21:39,666 --> 01:21:40,916
that bomber's head", it just--

1841
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,833
makes me wanna put a
bullet in my own head.

1842
01:21:43,333 --> 01:21:45,208
So I decided to plant my own bombs.

1843
01:21:45,916 --> 01:21:47,708
I know it, I'm sure you know it, too:

1844
01:21:47,791 --> 01:21:49,291
that bomber blew himself up.

1845
01:21:49,791 --> 01:21:50,916
You didn't kill him.

1846
01:21:52,625 --> 01:21:54,541
He just didn't wanna be thrown in jail,

1847
01:21:55,333 --> 01:21:57,083
so, he chose to die with honor.

1848
01:21:59,041 --> 01:22:00,708
I think he's way more honorable than you.

1849
01:22:02,958 --> 01:22:04,208
Are you out of your mind?

1850
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,458
What the hell did you just say?

1851
01:22:07,541 --> 01:22:08,500
Koga is more honorable

1852
01:22:08,583 --> 01:22:10,875
than me? How dare you.

1853
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:12,916
That's a load of shit.

1854
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:15,000
You're way out of line!

1855
01:22:16,208 --> 01:22:17,166
I'll never forgive you for

1856
01:22:17,666 --> 01:22:18,416
for saying that.

1857
01:22:19,375 --> 01:22:21,875
How can a snotty kid like
you make bombs anyway?

1858
01:22:23,416 --> 01:22:24,916
Enough with your stupid jokes.

1859
01:22:26,208 --> 01:22:27,416
I'm not joking at all.

1860
01:22:29,750 --> 01:22:30,500
Why don't you just…

1861
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,833
turn around and see for yourself?

1862
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,291
What the hell is this?

1863
01:24:13,750 --> 01:24:14,625
Yuzuki.

1864
01:24:25,166 --> 01:24:26,083
Incoming call.

1865
01:24:27,416 --> 01:24:28,708
Incoming call, line one.

1866
01:24:32,958 --> 01:24:33,875
This is Yoshimura.

1867
01:24:34,833 --> 01:24:36,666
I'll tell you how to defuse the bombs.

1868
01:24:44,541 --> 01:24:45,416
I'm sorry, who…

1869
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:46,375
is this?

1870
01:24:46,875 --> 01:24:48,250
Yuzuki Onodera.

1871
01:24:49,666 --> 01:24:52,166
I'm the one who planted bombs
on the Hayabusa train.

1872
01:24:55,750 --> 01:24:57,000
You gotta be kidding…

1873
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Yuzuki Onodera?

1874
01:25:05,250 --> 01:25:07,541
Are you on board the Hayabusa
Sixty right now?

1875
01:25:08,416 --> 01:25:09,250
Yes.

1876
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:11,083
Did you

1877
01:25:11,166 --> 01:25:12,250
really do it?

1878
01:25:13,416 --> 01:25:15,916
Why would you plant bombs on
the very train you're on?

1879
01:25:19,583 --> 01:25:21,041
I just killed my father

1880
01:25:22,333 --> 01:25:24,041
with the same kinda bombs I used here.

1881
01:25:25,541 --> 01:25:27,250
This is not about the money, is it?

1882
01:25:27,333 --> 01:25:28,666
What the hell do you want?

1883
01:25:28,750 --> 01:25:30,833
I already got what I wanted.

1884
01:25:31,625 --> 01:25:32,750
My dad is gone,

1885
01:25:33,250 --> 01:25:35,333
and I got to see the sight
I was hoping for.

1886
01:25:35,833 --> 01:25:38,083
So, I'll tell you how to defuse the bombs.

1887
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:39,791
Alright.

1888
01:25:40,375 --> 01:25:41,000
So tell me.

1889
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:45,125
The bombs will deactivate on their own

1890
01:25:52,125 --> 01:25:54,208
if one of these passengers takes my life.

1891
01:26:01,666 --> 01:26:03,291
I have a chronic illness,

1892
01:26:04,208 --> 01:26:07,708
so I have a small heart monitor
implanted in my chest.

1893
01:26:08,666 --> 01:26:11,458
If I die and my heart monitor stops,

1894
01:26:12,166 --> 01:26:14,083
an app on my phone emits a signal

1895
01:26:14,625 --> 01:26:15,791
which deactivates the bombs.

1896
01:26:16,291 --> 01:26:17,583
That's how it works.

1897
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:21,291
How do we know you're… telling the truth?

1898
01:26:24,750 --> 01:26:25,583
Hello?

1899
01:26:26,166 --> 01:26:27,000
Hello!

1900
01:26:28,583 --> 01:26:29,500
Damn it!

1901
01:26:31,166 --> 01:26:34,583
The Kanagawa Fire Department just reported
that a bombing occurred in Shibusawa,

1902
01:26:34,666 --> 01:26:36,250
Hadano City, about five minutes ago.

1903
01:26:36,750 --> 01:26:39,083
It matches Tsutomu Onodera's
current address.

1904
01:26:46,791 --> 01:26:47,833
Did you really do it?

1905
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:51,416
Is it true that

1906
01:26:52,333 --> 01:26:54,708
they'll automatically deactivate
if-- you die?

1907
01:26:57,083 --> 01:26:58,708
There's only one way to find out,

1908
01:26:59,208 --> 01:27:00,541
don't you think, Todoroki?

1909
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:46,458
We're working with crews
from various stations,

1910
01:27:46,541 --> 01:27:49,458
so let's stay organized and be
mindful of the adjacent tracks.

1911
01:27:49,541 --> 01:27:50,833
Okay, let's do a quick roll call.

1912
01:27:50,916 --> 01:27:51,791
Right side?

1913
01:27:51,875 --> 01:27:52,958
-Ready!
-Left side?

1914
01:27:53,041 --> 01:27:54,125
-Ready!
-Front side?

1915
01:27:54,208 --> 01:27:55,250
-Ready!
-Standby!

1916
01:27:55,333 --> 01:27:56,208
Yes, sir!

1917
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:58,625
Hello?

1918
01:27:59,125 --> 01:28:00,208
This is the on-site team.

1919
01:28:00,958 --> 01:28:01,791
Yeah.

1920
01:28:04,958 --> 01:28:05,666
And you're sure

1921
01:28:06,166 --> 01:28:07,666
we'll get the permit, right?

1922
01:28:09,833 --> 01:28:10,666
Okay.

1923
01:28:11,416 --> 01:28:12,291
Okay, copy that.

1924
01:28:12,375 --> 01:28:13,416
I trust you.

1925
01:28:15,041 --> 01:28:15,875
Okay.

1926
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:20,708
Let's get to work!

1927
01:28:21,708 --> 01:28:22,416
Yes, sir!

1928
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:24,000
All right everyone, let's go!

1929
01:28:24,083 --> 01:28:25,458
-Take your places!
-Yes, sir!

1930
01:28:25,541 --> 01:28:26,375
Okay!

1931
01:28:27,250 --> 01:28:29,375
-Connect me to JR Tokai!
-How does it look?

1932
01:28:30,125 --> 01:28:32,250
It's gotta be two feet
closer to Shinagawa.

1933
01:28:32,750 --> 01:28:33,875
Got it,

1934
01:28:33,958 --> 01:28:35,875
Put these away for now.
That's not our priority.

1935
01:28:35,958 --> 01:28:37,583
-I'm on it!
-Fifty sixty B's ETA is nine-oh-four p.m.

1936
01:28:37,666 --> 01:28:39,291
Okay, they're moving the
truck. You guide it, okay?

1937
01:28:39,375 --> 01:28:40,958
Sounds good, let's set the course.

1938
01:28:41,958 --> 01:28:43,333
I need some more over here!

1939
01:28:43,416 --> 01:28:44,541
Keep it coming!

1940
01:28:46,166 --> 01:28:47,416
-Service cart, coming through!
-Here you go.

1941
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:48,291
Watch out behind you!

1942
01:28:49,625 --> 01:28:51,291
Take that to the Shinagawa side, stat.

1943
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:52,958
Watch your step.

1944
01:28:53,541 --> 01:28:54,291
Go ahead.

1945
01:28:54,791 --> 01:28:56,083
They need some help over there!

1946
01:28:56,166 --> 01:28:57,125
How does it look?

1947
01:28:57,208 --> 01:28:59,250
JR Tokai's crew is coming over as well.

1948
01:28:59,333 --> 01:29:01,375
Let us know if HQ needs anything from us.

1949
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:02,833
One, two!

1950
01:29:03,958 --> 01:29:04,791
One, two!

1951
01:29:05,833 --> 01:29:06,750
One, two!

1952
01:29:07,875 --> 01:29:08,750
One, two!

1953
01:29:09,791 --> 01:29:10,666
One, two!

1954
01:29:11,791 --> 01:29:12,791
One, two!

1955
01:29:13,375 --> 01:29:13,916
One, two!

1956
01:29:14,958 --> 01:29:15,875
One, two!

1957
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:17,416
One, two!

1958
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:18,708
One, two!

1959
01:29:19,458 --> 01:29:20,375
One, two!

1960
01:29:31,375 --> 01:29:32,166
They told me

1961
01:29:32,666 --> 01:29:35,250
they started working on extending
the tracks minutes ago.

1962
01:29:35,833 --> 01:29:36,500
You think they

1963
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,625
can finish it on such short notice?

1964
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:40,541
No idea.

1965
01:29:41,041 --> 01:29:43,500
We just have to trust them
and hope for the best.

1966
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:45,041
Uh-

1967
01:29:45,125 --> 01:29:45,416
Mm-

1968
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:46,041
By the way,

1969
01:29:46,125 --> 01:29:47,250
if this plan fails…

1970
01:29:47,333 --> 01:29:47,958
w-

1971
01:29:48,458 --> 01:29:49,833
what's gonna happen to us?

1972
01:30:05,875 --> 01:30:06,750
What if

1973
01:30:07,791 --> 01:30:08,708
I do it?

1974
01:30:15,750 --> 01:30:18,250
I'm the least likely to
get in trouble over it.

1975
01:30:19,333 --> 01:30:20,333
You know…

1976
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:22,500
Oh…

1977
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,458
Th-- That's right.

1978
01:30:25,041 --> 01:30:25,958
You're right.

1979
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:27,791
And yeah, if you do it,

1980
01:30:28,458 --> 01:30:30,458
you'll be saving eight people, you know?

1981
01:30:31,250 --> 01:30:32,625
That even balances out the

1982
01:30:32,708 --> 01:30:33,583
chopper crash.

1983
01:30:34,166 --> 01:30:35,750
-Yeah?
-Balances out?

1984
01:30:36,541 --> 01:30:37,791
What do you mean by that?

1985
01:30:37,875 --> 01:30:38,916
Because, you know,

1986
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,166
the accident killed eight people,
didn't it?

1987
01:30:41,250 --> 01:30:42,166
It's a net zero.

1988
01:30:43,250 --> 01:30:44,125
Uh-huh.

1989
01:30:47,166 --> 01:30:48,208
You're fucking crazy.

1990
01:30:48,791 --> 01:30:49,458
Huh?

1991
01:30:51,125 --> 01:30:51,916
That's right.

1992
01:30:52,416 --> 01:30:55,166
You're fucking crazy.
What the hell is your problem anyway, huh?

1993
01:30:55,250 --> 01:30:56,125
Hey. J-

1994
01:30:56,875 --> 01:30:57,958
Just think about it, will you?

1995
01:30:58,041 --> 01:30:59,083
Actually, shouldn't it

1996
01:30:59,166 --> 01:31:00,708
generally be the politicians' job

1997
01:31:01,208 --> 01:31:02,500
to make ruthless
decisions in cases like this?

1998
01:31:02,583 --> 01:31:03,416
Uh--

1999
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:05,791
You don't know shit about politics,
asshole!

2000
01:31:05,875 --> 01:31:07,166
-Hey!
-You don't know shit about it!

2001
01:31:07,250 --> 01:31:07,875
Please!

2002
01:31:08,375 --> 01:31:09,541
-Calm down!
-Let go!

2003
01:31:09,625 --> 01:31:10,791
-Hayashi!
-Let me go!

2004
01:31:10,875 --> 01:31:13,083
-Calm down, guys, please.
-You're tearing my clothes. Come on,

2005
01:31:13,166 --> 01:31:15,375
-Hayashi, cut it out!
-this is expensive.

2006
01:31:15,458 --> 01:31:16,916
-Stop it! Please, stop it!
-Hayashi!

2007
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:18,791
-This is a high-end cardigan.
-You're a stuck-up piece of shit!

2008
01:31:18,875 --> 01:31:19,750
Calm down!

2009
01:31:19,833 --> 01:31:20,458
Stop it!

2010
01:31:20,541 --> 01:31:21,208
-Stop it! Come on!
-You have no right to

2011
01:31:21,291 --> 01:31:22,416
talk shit about politics!

2012
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:23,958
-Come on! Please!
-Get off me, damn it!

2013
01:31:24,041 --> 01:31:24,958
Hayashi! Enough!

2014
01:31:25,041 --> 01:31:26,000
-Calm down!
-He started it! It's all his fault!

2015
01:31:26,083 --> 01:31:26,958
-Just try to calm down.
-Hayashi!

2016
01:31:27,041 --> 01:31:28,041
Stop it!

2017
01:31:28,125 --> 01:31:28,875
-You old fucker!
-Calm down!

2018
01:31:28,958 --> 01:31:30,208
-Please stop!
-I'm gonna sue your ass when

2019
01:31:30,291 --> 01:31:31,875
-we're outta here, you'll see!
-Please just calm down!

2020
01:31:31,958 --> 01:31:33,458
-I'm gonna take your ass to court!
-Hayashi! Cut it out!

2021
01:31:33,541 --> 01:31:34,291
-Hey!
-Go to hell!

2022
01:31:34,791 --> 01:31:35,416
-You're not getting away with this!
-Shut up!

2023
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:36,125
Stuck-up piece of shit.

2024
01:31:36,208 --> 01:31:36,833
Stop!

2025
01:31:36,916 --> 01:31:39,875
Yuzuki Onodera's mother passed
away nine years ago.

2026
01:31:40,458 --> 01:31:41,583
We talked to the neighbors,

2027
01:31:41,666 --> 01:31:45,375
and they told us they started hearing a
lot of yelling from the house after that.

2028
01:31:45,458 --> 01:31:46,708
And it turns that Sutomu Onodera

2029
01:31:47,208 --> 01:31:48,083
is linked

2030
01:31:48,583 --> 01:31:49,958
to the "one-oh-nine case."

2031
01:31:50,041 --> 01:31:51,041
In fact,

2032
01:31:51,708 --> 01:31:55,250
he was one of the cops on the scene when
they tried to catch one of the bombers.

2033
01:31:55,333 --> 01:31:57,416
But then the bomber blew himself up.

2034
01:31:57,916 --> 01:32:01,416
I guess the higher-ups back then thought
that might make them look bad.

2035
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:02,958
So they turned him into a hero

2036
01:32:03,041 --> 01:32:06,333
by spreading the story that he shot and
killed the bomber in self-defense.

2037
01:32:07,583 --> 01:32:08,625
And then,

2038
01:32:08,708 --> 01:32:10,041
Onodera actually started

2039
01:32:10,125 --> 01:32:12,708
boasting about it and taking
credit for it later.

2040
01:32:14,458 --> 01:32:16,416
"The Shinkansen is still
here today because

2041
01:32:16,916 --> 01:32:17,875
of me"…

2042
01:32:18,458 --> 01:32:19,791
And other things like that.

2043
01:32:22,833 --> 01:32:24,875
I reached out to Yuzuki Onodera's doctor.

2044
01:32:25,625 --> 01:32:27,708
She does have a heart monitor
and a chronic illness,

2045
01:32:27,791 --> 01:32:29,291
so she wasn't lying about that.

2046
01:32:29,375 --> 01:32:30,291
And I reached out

2047
01:32:30,375 --> 01:32:32,625
to the cyber crime guys,
and apparently you can

2048
01:32:32,708 --> 01:32:35,041
link a bomb detonator to
an app on your phone.

2049
01:32:35,125 --> 01:32:36,541
So that's probably true, too.

2050
01:32:38,708 --> 01:32:40,000
Manufacturing explosives,

2051
01:32:40,791 --> 01:32:42,583
planting them underneath the trains…

2052
01:32:43,541 --> 01:32:44,416
It's hard to

2053
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:46,291
believe she did all this by herself.

2054
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,083
I bet there's a collaborator somewhere.

2055
01:33:07,208 --> 01:33:07,875
Can I

2056
01:33:08,375 --> 01:33:09,916
have a word with you, Yuzuki?

2057
01:33:11,041 --> 01:33:11,791
What is it?

2058
01:33:25,833 --> 01:33:26,750
Is there…

2059
01:33:29,208 --> 01:33:30,875
anything I can do for you, Yuzuki?

2060
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:34,041
You can kill me, I'd love that.

2061
01:33:35,625 --> 01:33:36,541
Other than that.

2062
01:33:41,708 --> 01:33:44,541
If… you're going through something and just

2063
01:33:46,208 --> 01:33:48,500
need to talk it out, if
that'd make you feel better, then…

2064
01:33:48,583 --> 01:33:49,500
Miss Ichikawa.

2065
01:33:52,916 --> 01:33:54,166
You knew about me, right?

2066
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,166
About my family and all.

2067
01:33:58,833 --> 01:34:03,125
That's why you've always been suspicious
of me, keeping an eye on me all the time,

2068
01:34:03,208 --> 01:34:04,041
right?

2069
01:34:05,875 --> 01:34:07,916
Checking to see if I fit in

2070
01:34:08,750 --> 01:34:10,750
and making sure I'm not causing trouble.

2071
01:34:11,791 --> 01:34:15,500
And then when you realized everything
was okay, you felt relieved, right?

2072
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,583
Are you saying this is my fault?

2073
01:34:23,291 --> 01:34:25,375
This isn't just one person's fault.

2074
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:30,416
Everyone clings to this
illusion of normalcy

2075
01:34:30,500 --> 01:34:33,000
with their happy little lies,
it's just so stupid.

2076
01:34:33,958 --> 01:34:36,208
And I had to force myself
to keep up the act,

2077
01:34:38,166 --> 01:34:40,166
just so everyone else could feel better.

2078
01:34:42,166 --> 01:34:44,166
So they could have the life they wanted.

2079
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:46,916
That's why…

2080
01:34:49,250 --> 01:34:50,458
I decided to shatter

2081
01:34:51,541 --> 01:34:52,458
that dumb illusion,

2082
01:34:54,333 --> 01:34:56,708
and see just how far I
could poison everyone.

2083
01:34:57,750 --> 01:34:58,875

turning on each other…

2087
01:35:04,666 --> 01:35:07,833
I just wanted to see everyone be
real for once and drop the act.

2088
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:24,166
I'm happy now.

They've been texting each other
a lot for a little while now.

2107

They even had a conversation

So this guy got in touch with her first,
huh?

2114
01:36:47,416 --> 01:36:48,250
Do you know who he is?

2115
01:36:48,333 --> 01:36:49,250
Yeah, I do.

2116
01:36:50,625 --> 01:36:51,500
He's in his fifties,

2117
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,500
lives in Saitama,
his address is listed right here.

Works as a blaster

There was a similar
incident when we were kids, right?

2125
01:37:25,250 --> 01:37:26,583
Is Masatoshi Koga here, by any chance?

2126
01:37:26,666 --> 01:37:27,541
A similar incident?

2127
01:37:27,625 --> 01:37:30,125
Yes, where they planted, you
know, bombs on a Shinkansen train.

2128
01:37:30,208 --> 01:37:31,333
Right. Oh, that's right.

2129
01:37:31,416 --> 01:37:33,166
That train, uh… was actually heading to

2130
01:37:33,250 --> 01:37:34,375
Hakata back then, right?

2131
01:37:34,458 --> 01:37:35,333

-Yeah.

This is

01:37:57,291 --> 01:37:58,291
pretty bad, isnt it?

01:38:07,083 --> 01:38:07,916
Fujii…

2138
01:38:09,666 --> 01:38:10,750
Fujii, listen.

2139
01:38:11,458 --> 01:38:12,375
Fujii, talk to me.

2140
01:38:13,125 --> 01:38:13,791
Fujii!

2141
01:38:14,291 --> 01:38:15,833
Wake up, Fujii!

2142
01:38:28,833 --> 01:38:30,666
If we don't take him to a hospital soon,

2143
01:38:30,750 --> 01:38:32,291
he might not make it out alive.

2144
01:38:38,541 --> 01:38:39,666
He's a really good guy.

2145
01:38:40,625 --> 01:38:41,625
A little naive, but…

2146
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:43,416
he's really eager,

2147
01:38:44,458 --> 01:38:45,458
and passionate, and…

2148
01:38:49,833 --> 01:38:50,916
I beg you.

2149
01:38:54,208 --> 01:38:55,166
I want to…

2150
01:38:55,250 --> 01:38:56,250
save his life.

2151
01:39:01,625 --> 01:39:03,375
Then please just kill me, Takaichi.

2152
01:39:05,833 --> 01:39:07,166
Why's that the only option?

2153
01:39:10,333 --> 01:39:11,333
That's your duty, right?

2154
01:39:11,416 --> 01:39:12,500
You have to do what's best

2155
01:39:12,583 --> 01:39:13,583
for your passengers.

2156
01:39:17,916 --> 01:39:19,083
And what's best for this

2157
01:39:20,083 --> 01:39:22,291
crazy passenger who everyone wants dead

2158
01:39:22,791 --> 01:39:24,583
is for you to just kill me right now.

2159
01:39:25,625 --> 01:39:26,833
Everyone here, myself included,

2160
01:39:27,333 --> 01:39:28,500
are just waiting

2161
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,708
for me to finally stop breathing.

2162
01:39:45,375 --> 01:39:47,416
I would never do that, do you understand?

2163
01:39:57,083 --> 01:39:58,166
Wait, hold on, don't--

2164
01:40:00,541 --> 01:40:02,000
That doesn't make any sense!

2165
01:40:02,791 --> 01:40:04,541
I gave them my word!

2166
01:40:05,125 --> 01:40:05,958
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2167
01:40:06,041 --> 01:40:06,958
My word!

2168
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,125
Of course I know that!

2169
01:40:09,625 --> 01:40:11,541
-But every minute counts right now.
-Yoshimura.

2170
01:40:11,625 --> 01:40:12,666
You know that, right?

2171
01:40:13,541 --> 01:40:14,791
We didn't have the time to
do it completely by the book.

2172
01:40:14,875 --> 01:40:16,083
What? What do you mean?!

2173
01:40:16,166 --> 01:40:18,166
Please. Can't you treat this as an
extralegal measure and make an exception

2174
01:40:18,250 --> 01:40:19,166
-for us?
-You can't be serious, there

2175
01:40:19,250 --> 01:40:20,583
are lives at stake right now!

2176
01:40:20,666 --> 01:40:21,583
Exactly.

2177
01:40:22,166 --> 01:40:23,083
-It's the only solution we could find!
-Besides,

2178
01:40:23,166 --> 01:40:24,583
how can you just make
a decision without--

2179
01:40:24,666 --> 01:40:26,833
We're not doing anything, and
now we're impeding their work?

2180
01:40:26,916 --> 01:40:28,458
That will destroy our image!

2181
01:40:28,541 --> 01:40:29,541
General Manager?

2182
01:40:29,625 --> 01:40:31,875
The whole nation's watching the
fate of the Hayabusa Sixty!

2183
01:40:31,958 --> 01:40:34,708
Please reconsider your decision, that's
all I'm asking. I'm begging you, please!

2184
01:40:34,791 --> 01:40:36,791
We're discontinuing the
work at Tokyo Station.

2185
01:40:36,875 --> 01:40:37,541
For what reason?

2186
01:40:38,041 --> 01:40:39,041
What reason, huh?!

2187
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:40,583
Hello?

2188
01:40:41,083 --> 01:40:42,041
Hello!

2189
01:40:42,750 --> 01:40:45,375
We're supposed to solve this
within our jurisdiction.

2190
01:40:47,875 --> 01:40:49,666
And the track extension plan is not.

2191

One, two!

2194
01:41:39,083 --> 01:41:40,000
One, two!

2195
01:41:40,833 --> 01:41:41,958
One, two!

2196
01:41:42,666 --> 01:41:43,333
Okay!

2197
01:41:43,916 --> 01:41:45,375
-One more time!
-Yes, sir!

2198
01:41:45,875 --> 01:41:46,958
One, two!

2199
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:48,958
One, two!

2200
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:50,916

One, two!

2204
01:41:57,833 --> 01:41:58,666
One--

2205
01:42:07,458 --> 01:42:08,250
You can't imagine how

2206
01:42:09,333 --> 01:42:10,125
sorry I am

2207
01:42:10,625 --> 01:42:11,375
for being helpless.

2208
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:17,125
I'll let you know right away
if there's any progress.

2209
01:42:20,958 --> 01:42:23,500
At this stage,
you're the only one we can count on.

2210
01:42:27,250 --> 01:42:29,041
Please keep an eye on our passengers.

2211
01:42:29,125 --> 01:42:31,416
Make sure they don't
do anything impulsive.

2212
01:42:35,666 --> 01:42:36,583
Maybe I will.

2213
01:42:39,333 --> 01:42:40,125
What?

2214
01:43:00,750 --> 01:43:02,916
The track extension plan
had to be canceled.

2215
01:43:10,333 --> 01:43:11,250
Takaichi…

2216
01:43:12,125 --> 01:43:13,083
Don't do it.

2217
01:43:47,666 --> 01:43:49,541
That's the expression I wanted to see.

2218
01:44:19,833 --> 01:44:21,208
Stop! You're creeping me out!

2219
01:44:21,291 --> 01:44:22,375
Stop it!

2220
01:44:25,083 --> 01:44:25,666
Stop it!

2221
01:44:26,250 --> 01:44:26,958
I said stop!

2222
01:44:34,458 --> 01:44:35,375
But no one…

2223
01:44:38,208 --> 01:44:39,833
no one cares if I live or die.

2224
01:45:21,166 --> 01:45:22,083
She's had

2225
01:45:23,166 --> 01:45:24,750
a miserable life.

2226
01:45:26,916 --> 01:45:27,958
Her father treated her

2227
01:45:28,041 --> 01:45:29,625
like garbage.

2228
01:45:32,458 --> 01:45:33,791
After her mother died,

2229
01:45:34,291 --> 01:45:35,791
the beatings got even worse.

2230
01:45:37,291 --> 01:45:38,833
What did he always to say her?

2231
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:40,833
Right…

2232
01:45:41,791 --> 01:45:43,000
"If only you'd been born a boy."

2233
01:45:59,083 --> 01:46:01,375
It's like he wished she'd never been born.

2234
01:46:02,833 --> 01:46:03,875
And that's one of the

2235
01:46:05,291 --> 01:46:07,500
harshest realities anyone could ever face.

2236
01:46:11,583 --> 01:46:14,666
So you decided to make bombs and
give them to her, didn't you?

2237
01:46:17,916 --> 01:46:21,791
The bomber of the "one-oh-nine case," whom
Tsutomu Onodera claims to have shot dead,

2238
01:46:22,666 --> 01:46:23,541
Masaru Koga is…

2239
01:46:25,375 --> 01:46:26,875
your father, isn't that right?

2240
01:46:39,583 --> 01:46:40,416
Yeah.

2241
01:46:42,041 --> 01:46:45,125
I'm sure you think your father
wanted to face death with honor,

2242
01:46:45,208 --> 01:46:46,750
but Onodera denied him that.

2243
01:46:48,541 --> 01:46:50,416
Correct me if I'm wrong, go ahead.

2244
01:46:58,875 --> 01:46:59,791
I'm sure…

2245
01:47:01,833 --> 01:47:04,000
you all know what kind
of person Onodera is.

2246
01:47:07,458 --> 01:47:08,916
He used to say things like

2247
01:47:10,708 --> 01:47:12,583
"I shot that bomber dead in a second,"

2248
01:47:14,333 --> 01:47:16,375
"I'm the hero of the 'one-oh-nine case'."

2249
01:47:17,916 --> 01:47:20,000
A despicable man who took pride in lies.

2250
01:47:25,125 --> 01:47:27,916
That's exactly why Yuzuki wanted
to target a Shinkansen.

2251
01:47:33,041 --> 01:47:35,125
Shinkansen trains are a reminder

2252
01:47:36,375 --> 01:47:38,541
of the hatred she has for her father.

2253
01:47:59,000 --> 01:47:59,916
The government just

2254
01:48:01,083 --> 01:48:03,666
gave us an order to forcibly
stop the train.

2255
01:48:07,375 --> 01:48:09,500
Takaichi has made an honorable decision.

2256
01:48:11,958 --> 01:48:13,500
He is our pride.

2257
01:48:17,375 --> 01:48:19,083
-I'll send a stop signal.
-No.

2258
01:48:20,750 --> 01:48:21,625
I should do it.

2259
01:48:23,500 --> 01:48:25,333
It's my responsibility until the end.

2260
01:48:28,125 --> 01:48:29,041
Alright.

2261
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,041
We found out where each of the bombs are.

2262
01:48:33,125 --> 01:48:34,625
Koga said there's three bombs left.

2263
01:48:34,708 --> 01:48:35,583
In car one,

2264
01:48:35,666 --> 01:48:36,541
car four,

2265
01:48:37,041 --> 01:48:38,208
and in car number six.

2266
01:48:38,291 --> 01:48:40,833
Three bombs exploding?
There'd be no stopping it.

2267
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,125
Yoshimura. Where's the zero kilometer post?

2268
01:48:52,666 --> 01:48:54,791
Eleven kilometers from Omiya Station.

2269
01:49:02,250 --> 01:49:03,166
What is it, Kasagi?

2270
01:49:09,166 --> 01:49:10,541
WASHINOMIYA

2271
01:49:14,291 --> 01:49:17,291
The question really is,
can everyone on the train endure it?

2272
01:49:18,083 --> 01:49:19,000
And we need…

2273
01:49:25,916 --> 01:49:28,250
We need a show of goodwill
from the government.

2274
01:49:30,875 --> 01:49:32,541
Hey, can you connect them, please?

2275
01:49:44,875 --> 01:49:45,541
It's connected.

2276
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,250
We're going to uncouple

2277
01:49:53,750 --> 01:49:56,333
the Hayabusa Sixty while it's
moving using two switches.

2278
01:49:56,833 --> 01:49:58,208
To keep damage to a minimum,

2279
01:49:58,291 --> 01:50:00,166
we'll carry out the operation
on the branch

2280
01:50:00,250 --> 01:50:03,916
line to Washinomiya Maintenance Center,
which is in a less populated area.

2281
01:50:04,541 --> 01:50:07,208
Cars one through six will be directed
onto the northbound track.

2282
01:50:07,291 --> 01:50:08,250
And then,

2283
01:50:08,333 --> 01:50:10,333
as soon as the front truck
of car seven passes,

2284
01:50:10,416 --> 01:50:11,500
we'll operate switch A.

2285
01:50:12,500 --> 01:50:14,541
This will send car seven
skidding diagonally

2286
01:50:14,625 --> 01:50:15,833
across both the southbound

2287
01:50:16,333 --> 01:50:18,250
and northbound tracks,
followed by car eight.

2288
01:50:18,333 --> 01:50:19,291
Once the train

2289
01:50:19,375 --> 01:50:21,958
reaches the branch line at
the Washinomiya junction,

2290
01:50:22,583 --> 01:50:23,750
we'll operate switch B.

2291
01:50:25,083 --> 01:50:28,833
By timing the switch activation with a
specific car, we can uncouple the train,

2292
01:50:28,916 --> 01:50:31,666
sending cars one through six ahead
to explode on the branch line,

2293
01:50:31,750 --> 01:50:34,375
while cars seven and eight
stop on the main line.

2294
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:37,041
That's the strategy.

2295
01:50:44,125 --> 01:50:45,666
Each car is twenty five meters long.

2296
01:50:46,166 --> 01:50:48,208
If the train's going one hundred
kilometers per hour,

2297
01:50:48,291 --> 01:50:50,208
we'll have less than a second
to operate switch A.

2298
01:50:50,291 --> 01:50:52,333
Plus, switch B is used for maintenance,

2299
01:50:52,416 --> 01:50:54,208
so it can only be operated manually.

2300
01:51:00,708 --> 01:51:01,541
Jesus.

2301
01:51:02,416 --> 01:51:05,333
This sounds as easy as catching
smoke with your bare hands.

2302
01:51:06,458 --> 01:51:08,625
Even if we do pull off the uncoupling,

2303
01:51:08,708 --> 01:51:11,083
derailing a train at one hundred
kilometers per hour…

2304
01:51:11,166 --> 01:51:14,291
That will definitely deal a serious
blow to the Hayabusa sixty.

2305
01:51:20,916 --> 01:51:22,541
You told me the bombs can't be defused.

2306
01:51:23,041 --> 01:51:24,583
Are you absolutely sure?

2307
01:51:32,291 --> 01:51:35,041
Is everyone aboard the Hayabusa
Sixty on the same page?

2308
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:08,833
Yes.

2309
01:52:09,333 --> 01:52:10,208
Let's try that.

2310
01:52:14,750 --> 01:52:15,666
Okay, then.

2311
01:52:16,375 --> 01:52:18,208
Tell me all the equipment we need.

2312
01:52:19,875 --> 01:52:20,833
Thank you very much!

2313
01:52:20,916 --> 01:52:22,333
-Great.
-Yes!

2314
01:52:22,416 --> 01:52:23,333
Let's get to it!

2315
01:52:24,083 --> 01:52:25,000
-Okay.
-Yes, sir.

2316
01:52:35,333 --> 01:52:36,666
UNCOUPLING POINT

2317
01:52:37,875 --> 01:52:43,791
NASUSHIOBARA CITY,
TOCHIGI PREFECTURE 160 KM TO TOKYO

2318
01:52:49,583 --> 01:52:51,333
I'm heading to the driver's cab now.

2319
01:52:51,416 --> 01:52:55,083
See if you can find as much soft,
cushioning material as you can, okay?

2320
01:52:55,166 --> 01:52:56,208
-Got it.
-Okay.

2321
01:52:56,291 --> 01:52:57,666
-Yep.
-Be right back, ma'am.

2322
01:53:00,708 --> 01:53:02,416
Soft stuff… There.

2323
01:53:02,500 --> 01:53:03,291
And this.

2324
01:53:03,791 --> 01:53:05,083
This'll work, too. Okay.

2325
01:53:33,750 --> 01:53:35,125
The Hayabusa Number Sixty

2326
01:53:36,208 --> 01:53:37,666
is nearly reaching Washinomiya.

2327
01:53:38,583 --> 01:53:42,083
It has been running continuously since
it departed Shin-Aomori Station.

2328
01:53:42,958 --> 01:53:44,166
Matsumoto, we have to go.

2329
01:53:44,250 --> 01:53:45,208
Okay.

2330
01:53:46,625 --> 01:53:47,583
Takaichi.

2331
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:50,583
I have a favor to ask.

2332
01:53:53,125 --> 01:53:54,041
My hand…

2333
01:53:55,875 --> 01:53:58,041
Could you take it off
the master controller?

2334
01:54:00,833 --> 01:54:01,708
Of course.

2335
01:54:16,166 --> 01:54:17,333
120 kilometers per hour,

2336
01:54:17,875 --> 01:54:18,708
check!

2337
01:54:28,750 --> 01:54:30,250
Watch out, that's high voltage!

2338
01:54:30,333 --> 01:54:31,416
Start deploying the ladder!

2339
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:32,958
-Turn the ladder.
-Make sure the

2340
01:54:33,041 --> 01:54:35,208
information-sharing system is ready to go,
ASAP.

2341
01:54:35,291 --> 01:54:37,375
Our priority here is to
rescue everyone on board.

2342
01:54:37,458 --> 01:54:38,875
Don't worry about vehicle damage.

2343
01:54:38,958 --> 01:54:41,541
The command center has been set
up at the heart of the field.

2344
01:54:41,625 --> 01:54:43,875
-Kabuki Construction, crash cushions!
-Go around!

2345
01:54:43,958 --> 01:54:46,208
-That way! That way!
-Go around!

2346
01:54:46,916 --> 01:54:47,833
"That way!"

2347
01:54:52,125 --> 01:54:54,291
The high voltages ones are three and up.

2348
01:54:54,375 --> 01:54:56,458
-Water!
-Releasing water!

2349
01:54:57,208 --> 01:54:58,291
Pressure's coming up!

2350
01:55:00,916 --> 01:55:02,250
Lift them up! Step back.

2351
01:55:02,333 --> 01:55:03,083
Hoist them up!

2352
01:55:03,625 --> 01:55:04,416
Okay. Step back!

2353
01:55:05,041 --> 01:55:05,958
Alright, keep it going.

2354
01:55:06,458 --> 01:55:08,291
A track maintenance vehicle is coming in.

2355
01:55:08,375 --> 01:55:09,166
Two,

2356
01:55:09,250 --> 01:55:09,708
one…

2357
01:55:10,208 --> 01:55:11,208
Okay, it's stopped.

2358
01:55:12,125 --> 01:55:15,916
We're setting up three separate
blocks of these on the main line.

2359
01:55:19,166 --> 01:55:19,708
Yeah!

2360
01:55:19,791 --> 01:55:20,250
Yeah!

2361
01:55:20,333 --> 01:55:20,750
Okay, that's good!

2362
01:55:20,833 --> 01:55:22,583
-Three, two, one…
-Three, two, one…

2363
01:55:37,875 --> 01:55:39,041
-Here, take this.
-Okay.

2364
01:55:57,125 --> 01:55:58,500
-There you have it.
-Ah.

2365
01:55:58,583 --> 01:55:59,416
Hang in there.

2366
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:05,291
Come on.

2367
01:56:08,458 --> 01:56:09,500
You'll be safer here.

2368
01:56:16,958 --> 01:56:18,458
Oh, you haven't met her, right?

2369
01:56:18,541 --> 01:56:19,791
This is the driver, Matsumoto.

2370
01:56:20,291 --> 01:56:21,125
I, uh…

2371
01:56:21,625 --> 01:56:22,708
I'm sorry.

2372
01:56:23,458 --> 01:56:24,375
I braked too suddenly.

2373
01:56:24,875 --> 01:56:26,916
And I know that because of that, it----

2374
01:56:27,750 --> 01:56:28,750
No need to apologize.

2375
01:56:29,750 --> 01:56:32,041
Just help us find stuff
to cushion the impact.

2376
01:56:33,500 --> 01:56:34,333
Sure.

2377
01:56:42,041 --> 01:56:42,791
Fujii!

2378
01:56:45,291 --> 01:56:46,083
Don't worry about it.

2379
01:56:53,833 --> 01:56:55,166
We're gonna save him, okay?

2380
01:56:57,833 --> 01:56:59,833
After the hijacking of
Japan's iconic Bullet Train…

2381
01:56:59,916 --> 01:57:02,541
Six hours have passed since the
Japanese bullet train was hijacked.

2382
01:57:02,625 --> 01:57:05,083
The government has initiated
a high-stakes rescue operation

2383
01:57:05,166 --> 01:57:07,041
The government has issued an
operation order to rescue the nine

2384
01:57:07,125 --> 01:57:08,291
remaining passengers and crew aboard.

2385
01:57:08,375 --> 01:57:10,625
Aimed at freeing the nine remaining
passengers and crew. Details of the

2386
01:57:10,708 --> 01:57:11,958
operation remain unclear,

2387
01:57:12,458 --> 01:57:17,375
it is expected to be highly dangerous, as
authorities attempt to stop the speeding

2388
01:57:17,458 --> 01:57:20,083
train. At the train's
anticipated location--

2389
01:57:20,166 --> 01:57:21,041
Yuzuki.

2390
01:57:21,125 --> 01:57:26,583
-A coordinated effort is underway,
-It's ready.

2391
01:57:26,666 --> 01:57:33,291
All right.
Let's go. You keep it going. See you. Bye.

2392
01:57:34,166 --> 01:57:35,583
Will the mission
succeed in saving the nine?

2393
01:57:35,666 --> 01:57:38,166
Will the nine be successfully rescued?
We're all waiting for the outcome with

2394
01:57:38,250 --> 01:57:40,166
-hope.
-We all await the outcome with hope.

2395

No foreign objects detected!

2398
01:57:56,500 --> 01:57:57,333
Okay.

2399
01:57:57,875 --> 01:57:58,916
We're almost done over here.

2400
01:57:59,000 --> 01:57:59,916
-Great.
-Let's start testing the switch!

2401
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:00,916
Okay, sounds good.

2402
01:58:01,750 --> 01:58:02,791
Okay, guys.

2403
01:58:02,875 --> 01:58:03,666
Six minutes left.

2404
01:58:03,750 --> 01:58:04,458
-Okay!
-Hurry up!

2405
01:58:04,541 --> 01:58:06,208
-Power's ready.
-You handle it, okay?

2406
01:58:06,291 --> 01:58:07,083
Yes, sir!

2407
01:58:07,583 --> 01:58:08,708
Power on!

2408
01:58:09,416 --> 01:58:10,375
And testing!

2409
01:58:25,500 --> 01:58:26,458
That looks good.

2410
01:58:27,541 --> 01:58:28,750
-Make sure that's tight.
-Yeah.

2411
01:58:29,250 --> 01:58:30,291
Oh.

2412
01:58:30,375 --> 01:58:32,125
-It's not too tight, is it?
-No.

2413
01:58:32,208 --> 01:58:32,791
Great.

2414
01:58:33,291 --> 01:58:34,125
Okay.

2415
01:58:34,958 --> 01:58:35,583
Good.

2416
01:58:36,083 --> 01:58:37,250
This should be fine. Oh,

2417
01:58:37,833 --> 01:58:38,750
let me make that tighter.

2418
01:58:38,833 --> 01:58:39,666
Great.

2419
01:58:53,375 --> 01:58:54,583
When did you get that?!

2420
01:58:55,291 --> 01:58:57,000
Give that to someone who can handle it.

2421
01:58:57,083 --> 01:58:59,541
I mean, I guess you're right,
but that's not all yours.

2422
01:58:59,625 --> 01:59:01,125
-Okay.
-Thanks.

2423
01:59:14,208 --> 01:59:15,041
Fujii.

2424
01:59:16,541 --> 01:59:17,291
Hang in there.

2425
01:59:33,625 --> 01:59:34,250
It's close!

2426
01:59:34,750 --> 01:59:36,625
It'll be at the uncoupling point soon.

2427
01:59:47,958 --> 01:59:49,583
Fifty sixty B is approaching

2428
01:59:50,250 --> 01:59:52,583
at one hundred and twenty-one
kilometers per hour.

2429
02:00:11,250 --> 02:00:12,291
It's here!

2430
02:00:14,458 --> 02:00:16,208
Fifty sixty B is approaching the switch.

2431
02:00:22,958 --> 02:00:23,916
Wait for car seven.

2432
02:00:25,375 --> 02:00:26,208
Ten…

2433
02:00:27,916 --> 02:00:28,750
Nine…

2434
02:00:30,666 --> 02:00:31,500
Eight…

2435
02:00:33,666 --> 02:00:34,500
Seven…

2436
02:00:37,166 --> 02:00:37,791
Six…

2437
02:00:40,375 --> 02:00:41,041
Five…

2438
02:00:43,125 --> 02:00:43,958
Four…

2439
02:00:46,375 --> 02:00:47,208
Three…

2440
02:00:49,208 --> 02:00:50,083
Switch fifty-two.

2441
02:00:50,166 --> 02:00:50,958
Throw it!

2442
02:01:07,541 --> 02:01:08,541
Switch fifty-one.

2443
02:01:08,625 --> 02:01:10,500
-Throw it!
-Yes, sir!

2444
02:01:24,500 --> 02:01:25,458
Matsumoto!

2445
02:01:50,708 --> 02:01:51,416
Fujii!

2446
02:02:35,250 --> 02:02:36,708
Fifty sixty B has stopped.

2447
02:02:37,666 --> 02:02:39,791
Car eight of Fifty sixty B has stopped.

2448
02:02:40,541 --> 02:02:43,791
Cars one through six have derailed
on the Washinomiya branch line.

2449
02:02:43,875 --> 02:02:46,166
Cars one, four and six are on fire.

2450
02:02:46,750 --> 02:02:48,250
ERT, on our way to the scene.

2451
02:02:49,083 --> 02:02:49,708
Copy.

2452
02:02:50,208 --> 02:02:51,583
This is the Heli Musashi.
We'll transmit the video footage

2453
02:02:51,666 --> 02:02:52,791
from near the junction.

2454
02:02:56,625 --> 02:02:57,250
ERT.

2455
02:02:57,750 --> 02:02:59,208
We're almost at the scene.

2456
02:03:05,750 --> 02:03:06,666
We're at the scene.

2457
02:03:07,583 --> 02:03:09,041
We're entering the car.

2458
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:11,541
Ready?

2459
02:03:12,750 --> 02:03:13,875
-Two, one…
-Two, one…

2460
02:03:15,083 --> 02:03:15,958
All right.

2461
02:03:16,041 --> 02:03:17,125
The path is clear.

2462
02:03:17,916 --> 02:03:18,916
We're in the car now.

2463
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:20,666
We're searching for survivors.

2464
02:03:22,083 --> 02:03:23,083
Watch out for the cables.

2465
02:03:23,166 --> 02:03:24,541
-They're broken.
-We're a rescue team.

2466
02:03:24,625 --> 02:03:25,875
-Hey!
-Can anyone hear me?

2467
02:03:25,958 --> 02:03:27,708
Please respond if you can hear us.

2468
02:03:29,375 --> 02:03:30,208
Okay.

2469
02:03:31,750 --> 02:03:32,875
We're here to rescue you.

2470
02:03:32,958 --> 02:03:34,291
Can anyone hear me?

2471
02:03:34,375 --> 02:03:35,166
Can you hear me?

2472
02:03:35,666 --> 02:03:36,750
How is it over there?

2473
02:03:38,166 --> 02:03:39,416
Haven't found anyone yet.

2474
02:03:40,916 --> 02:03:42,291
-Let's go to the back.
-Okay.

2475
02:03:42,375 --> 02:03:42,833
Okay.

2476
02:03:43,333 --> 02:03:45,000
-Please respond if you can hear us!
-No! Damn it!

2477
02:03:45,083 --> 02:03:46,083
Can anyone hear me?

2478
02:03:46,583 --> 02:03:48,541
Hey, can you help me lift
this thing over here?

2479
02:03:48,625 --> 02:03:49,833
Yeah, coming.

2480
02:03:49,916 --> 02:03:50,916
Damn it!

2481
02:03:52,041 --> 02:03:53,958
If you hear me, please make some noise!

2482
02:03:56,375 --> 02:03:59,541
Over here, I got something! Over here,
they're here! Come on! I need help over

2483
02:03:59,625 --> 02:04:00,541
-here!
-Coming.

2484
02:04:00,625 --> 02:04:02,541
They're all here, we're
gonna check on them right now.

2485
02:04:02,625 --> 02:04:03,500
They're here!

2486
02:04:03,583 --> 02:04:04,291
Hm?

2487
02:04:04,791 --> 02:04:06,416
-What was that?
-We found them, sir!

2488
02:04:06,500 --> 02:04:09,833
-Say that again!
-We found them all, we were just checking

2489
02:04:09,916 --> 02:04:12,041
if they're okay, and all nine of them are
alive, sir.

2490
02:04:12,125 --> 02:04:13,250
I'm okay.

2491
02:04:15,750 --> 02:04:17,333
We've confirmed that everyone is alive!

2492
02:04:18,125 --> 02:04:18,958
Yes!

2493
02:04:31,291 --> 02:04:32,541
It worked, thank god!

2494
02:04:39,208 --> 02:04:40,208
Great job, everyone.

2495
02:04:41,041 --> 02:04:42,125
Thanks for everything!

2496
02:04:42,833 --> 02:04:45,000
Let's get back to business
and resume service.

2497
02:04:45,083 --> 02:04:46,375
Cancel all trains between

2498
02:04:46,458 --> 02:04:48,375
Omiya, Oyama, Sendai and Furukawa,

2499
02:04:48,875 --> 02:04:49,958
and resume service on

2500
02:04:50,041 --> 02:04:51,625
the other sections one by one. Clear?

2501
02:04:51,708 --> 02:04:52,541
Yes, sir!

2502
02:04:53,416 --> 02:04:55,041
-Train list check!
-Thank you so much!

2503
02:04:55,125 --> 02:04:56,791
-Thirty thirty-two B. Morioka, southbound.
-Great job!

2504
02:04:56,875 --> 02:04:58,208
-How's the pantograph thing?
-Really, really well done.

2505
02:04:58,291 --> 02:04:59,166
It's working now.

2506
02:04:59,250 --> 02:05:01,416
Thirty twenty-seven B., also
heading to Morioka, derailed.

2507
02:05:01,500 --> 02:05:03,500
-Alright, back to work?
-I'll contact headquarters.

2508
02:05:03,583 --> 02:05:05,291
All right. Please double-check the tracks

2509
02:05:05,375 --> 02:05:06,333
and the electricity.

2510
02:05:06,416 --> 02:05:08,833
-We gotta bring it down-
-We're here by switch fifty-one.

2511
02:05:08,916 --> 02:05:10,458
All three operators are safe.

2512
02:05:10,541 --> 02:05:11,166
Copy.

2513
02:05:11,666 --> 02:05:12,875
Good job, everyone.

2514
02:05:13,375 --> 02:05:14,333
The patient's ready.

2515
02:05:14,416 --> 02:05:15,125
We're good to go.

2516
02:05:15,625 --> 02:05:16,500
You'll be okay.

2517
02:05:17,166 --> 02:05:18,291
-We're taking you to the hospital, okay?
-Fujii!

2518
02:05:18,375 --> 02:05:19,375
Hurry up, he needs a transfusion.

2519
02:05:19,458 --> 02:05:20,208
-Okay.
-Okay.

2520
02:05:20,708 --> 02:05:21,750
Fujii.

2521
02:05:21,833 --> 02:05:22,916
He's gonna be fine.

2522
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:24,375
We'll take care of him.
Let's go.

2523
02:05:24,458 --> 02:05:24,833
Okay.

2524
02:05:25,333 --> 02:05:26,541
-One, two, three…
-Three…

2525
02:05:28,625 --> 02:05:29,500
All right.

2526
02:05:29,583 --> 02:05:30,500
Door's closing.

2527
02:05:31,333 --> 02:05:33,000
We'll check the evacuation
status, starting with Honden-cho.

2528
02:05:33,083 --> 02:05:34,000
Yeah, okay.

2529
02:05:36,791 --> 02:05:40,541
The ambulance is turning left.

2530
02:05:42,416 --> 02:05:44,875
The TMPD will handle the suspect.
Saitama PD, continue assisting at the

2531
02:05:44,958 --> 02:05:46,083
-scene.
-Omiya Tech Center staff,

2532
02:05:46,166 --> 02:05:47,250
gather at the command center!

2533
02:05:47,875 --> 02:05:48,750
Saitama PD.

2534
02:05:48,833 --> 02:05:49,958
Copy that.

2535
02:05:50,625 --> 02:05:51,750
Paramedic captain speaking.

2536
02:05:52,250 --> 02:05:54,250
One victim was transported
in grave condition.

2537
02:05:54,333 --> 02:05:57,083
The other eight have minor injuries,
but nothing major.

2538
02:05:59,041 --> 02:06:01,791
-My name is Kawagoe.
-SPD, HQ. Copy that.

2539
02:06:01,875 --> 02:06:04,458
I'm in charge of your investigation.

2540
02:06:10,083 --> 02:06:11,083
Do you regret it?

2541
02:06:13,458 --> 02:06:14,375
Not at all.

2542
02:06:16,041 --> 02:06:17,875
Because I did it of my own free will.

2543
02:06:20,750 --> 02:06:22,875
Koga took advantage of your hatred

2544
02:06:24,291 --> 02:06:27,791
to get his revenge on Tsutomu Onodera
without getting his hands dirty.

2545
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:29,916
Your free will

2546
02:06:30,416 --> 02:06:32,833
was very convenient for Koga,
don't you think so?

2547
02:06:35,541 --> 02:06:37,791
Does thinking like that
make you feel better?

2548
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,083
I'm just a poor, miserable girl who was

2549
02:06:44,166 --> 02:06:45,375
used by an evil adult.

2550
02:06:48,916 --> 02:06:50,500
The illusion of normalcy again.

2551
02:06:53,291 --> 02:06:56,208
You strike me as someone who
hates everyone and everything.

2552
02:06:57,791 --> 02:06:58,625
But…

2553
02:07:20,208 --> 02:07:20,958
I wouldn't say

2554
02:07:21,583 --> 02:07:23,208
the world is completely hopeless.

2555
02:07:35,416 --> 02:07:37,375
-Take her away.
-There's a lot of reporters out here.

2556
02:07:37,458 --> 02:07:38,125
Copy that.

2557
02:07:38,625 --> 02:07:39,666
Can we get someone to
set up a barrier, please?

2558
02:07:39,750 --> 02:07:41,083
This is the fire headquarters. There
are no injuries around the branch line.

2559
02:07:41,166 --> 02:07:42,166
Copy that.

2560
02:07:42,666 --> 02:07:43,958
-We'll check with the local authorities.
-This is the command center. Copy that.

2561
02:07:44,041 --> 02:07:45,000
Sounds good. Copy that.

2562
02:07:45,500 --> 02:07:48,208
They're suppressing the fire
at cars one through six.

2563
02:07:48,958 --> 02:07:49,791
Copy.

2564
02:07:50,291 --> 02:07:51,333
-Thank you.
-We've expanded the barriers.

2565
02:07:51,416 --> 02:07:52,500
Kawagoe, TMPD.

2566
02:07:53,083 --> 02:07:55,208
The suspect is being taken
by the paramedics.

2567
02:07:55,291 --> 02:07:56,208
Copy that, sir.

2568
02:07:56,875 --> 02:07:58,166
I'm still burning from that drink.

2569
02:07:58,250 --> 02:07:59,750
Of course you would say that.

2570
02:08:01,916 --> 02:08:04,250
All twenty-one people from eight
households have been confirmed.

2571
02:08:04,333 --> 02:08:05,041
Okay.

2572
02:08:05,541 --> 02:08:07,333
-One day we'll all laugh about this…
-Moving on to Jonan.

2573
02:08:07,416 --> 02:08:09,250
-Eight people.
-Okay. Next, Aoba.

2574
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,375
Eighteen people, five houses, confirmed.

2575
02:08:13,333 --> 02:08:13,958
Okay.

2576
02:08:14,458 --> 02:08:15,750
-Honmachi.
-The van is here!

2577
02:08:15,833 --> 02:08:17,750
Fifteen people, four houses, confirmed.

2578
02:08:18,458 --> 02:08:19,291
Okay.

2579
02:08:19,916 --> 02:08:22,041
I guess that completes
the evacuation report.

2580
02:08:22,125 --> 02:08:22,958
Great.

2581
02:08:23,625 --> 02:08:25,291
-JTSB is arriving. Make room.
-Let's make sure they all get

2582
02:08:25,375 --> 02:08:27,375
shelter information as soon as possible.

2583
02:08:32,291 --> 02:08:33,916
-I'll leave it to you.
-Copy that.

2584
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:35,000
Let's do it.

2585
02:08:40,791 --> 02:08:42,916
The van is ready, it's right this way.

2586
02:08:44,333 --> 02:08:45,166
Here.

2587
02:08:45,791 --> 02:08:48,166
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you. I appreciate it.

2588
02:08:48,708 --> 02:08:51,166
-Thank you. The van is this way.
-Take care of yourselves.

2589
02:08:51,250 --> 02:08:53,708
-Thank you for taking care of us.
-You're very welcome.

2590
02:08:54,208 --> 02:08:56,208
I received a message from the TMPD.

2591
02:09:02,500 --> 02:09:03,083
Good!

2592
02:09:03,583 --> 02:09:04,625
And salute!

2593
02:09:06,666 --> 02:09:08,250
-I brought you…
-Kawaguchi Fire Department!

2594
02:09:08,333 --> 02:09:09,208
Relief supplies.

2595
02:09:09,291 --> 02:09:10,250
Sir!

2596
02:09:13,833 --> 02:09:14,958
-Oh!
-Kawaguchi Fire Department!

2597
02:09:15,041 --> 02:09:17,125
-There's an apple pie in there, too.
-Sir!

2598
02:09:17,791 --> 02:09:18,833
Thanks, I'm starving.

2599
02:09:20,500 --> 02:09:22,333
Could they come here and check?

2600
02:09:25,250 --> 02:09:27,333
I'm sure JTSB will step in before that.

2601
02:09:28,750 --> 02:09:32,125
-The van is about to depart!
-Of course they'll handle the fire, but

2602
02:09:32,208 --> 02:09:34,500
JR needs JTSB's decision before doing
anything.

2603
02:09:34,583 --> 02:09:35,500
We made it!

2604
02:09:35,583 --> 02:09:36,750
-You did it.
-Takaichi!

2605
02:09:36,833 --> 02:09:37,958
Well done!

2606
02:09:39,041 --> 02:09:39,708
Thank you.

2607
02:09:40,208 --> 02:09:41,291
Thank you so much.

2608
02:09:50,125 --> 02:09:51,041
Thank you so much.

2609
02:09:53,625 --> 02:09:54,541
I appreciate that.

2610
02:09:58,625 --> 02:10:00,416
We were worried about you, Takaichi!

2611
02:10:04,291 --> 02:10:05,208
Thank you so much!

2612
02:10:08,375 --> 02:10:09,291
Thank you so much!

2613
02:10:11,250 --> 02:10:12,291
Thanks to all of you!

2614
02:10:15,458 --> 02:10:16,416
We did it!
