00:00:37,602 --> 00:00:39,604
this party stop

4
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,439
this feeling stop

5
00:00:50,093 --> 00:00:51,486
Okay, Charlotte,

6
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,183
I've got your outfit.

7
00:00:53,357 --> 00:00:55,316
I'm just gonna put it
on the couch for you.

8
00:00:56,404 --> 00:00:58,232
And your shoes,

9
00:00:58,406 --> 00:00:59,972
and I just need
your opinion on
these two scarves.

10
00:01:00,147 --> 00:01:00,973
Oh. This one.

11
00:01:01,148 --> 00:01:02,279
This, thank you.

12
00:01:12,289 --> 00:01:14,465
this party stop

13
00:01:16,685 --> 00:01:17,425
Our guest today is
a Rhodes Scholar,

14
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:18,600
famed psychologist

15
00:01:18,774 --> 00:01:20,254
and holds a PhD from Oxford.

16
00:01:20,428 --> 00:01:22,952
But you all know her
as an author of three,

17
00:01:23,126 --> 00:01:25,955
soon to be four,
best-selling books

18
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:27,652
on love and relationships.

19
00:01:27,826 --> 00:01:28,697
Please welcome,

20
00:01:28,871 --> 00:01:30,438
the one, the only,

21
00:01:30,612 --> 00:01:31,656
Miss Charlotte Meyers.

22
00:01:32,831 --> 00:01:34,181
Hi.

23
00:01:34,355 --> 00:01:36,052
Aw, thank you.

24
00:01:36,226 --> 00:01:37,184
So wonderful to see you.

25
00:01:37,358 --> 00:01:38,185
So nice to see you.

26
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:39,273
Oh, sit down.

27
00:01:39,447 --> 00:01:41,101
Thank you, wow.

28
00:01:41,275 --> 00:01:42,580
So Charlotte,
tell us about
your new book.

29
00:01:42,754 --> 00:01:46,323
Well this book is
very personal to me.

30
00:01:46,497 --> 00:01:48,543
It's about how my
fiancee Doug and I

31
00:01:48,717 --> 00:01:51,633
found each other again after
a particularly rough patch.

32
00:01:51,807 --> 00:01:53,374
Want to read
us a snippet?

33
00:01:53,548 --> 00:01:54,723
Sure.

34
00:01:55,419 --> 00:01:56,812
Okay, let's see.

35
00:01:57,769 --> 00:01:58,553
Oh, this is a good one.

36
00:02:01,512 --> 00:02:03,993
I knew in my bones that
something was different.

37
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:07,170
I could no longer hide from
the piercing persistent truth

38
00:02:07,344 --> 00:02:10,391
that was desperately trying
to knock down my door.

39
00:02:10,565 --> 00:02:13,176
Doug and I had
fallen out of love

40
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,526
and I didn't think
we could recover.

41
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:44,555
So your strength comes
from your whole torso,

42
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:46,470
not just your arms.

43
00:02:46,644 --> 00:02:49,647
What you're gonna do is
dig in with your shoulder

44
00:02:49,821 --> 00:02:52,563
and then rotate
all the way back.

45
00:02:52,737 --> 00:02:53,956
Just like that.

46
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:58,178
You're gonna have to
use the J stroke, Karen,

47
00:02:58,352 --> 00:03:00,267
or you're just gonna
keep going in circles.

48
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,491
Please put the phone away.

49
00:03:09,885 --> 00:03:11,278
Karen.

50
00:03:19,373 --> 00:03:20,591
Whoa!

51
00:03:20,765 --> 00:03:22,550
Perfect, just like that.

52
00:03:24,334 --> 00:03:25,640
Sir?

53
00:03:25,814 --> 00:03:28,120
Sir, can you dive in
and get my phone?

54
00:03:30,862 --> 00:03:32,212
Yeah Mike?

55
00:03:32,995 --> 00:03:34,997
Yeah we got another
phone in the drink.

56
00:03:41,003 --> 00:03:44,398
Hey Mike, we now have
the owner of said phone

57
00:03:44,572 --> 00:03:45,834
also in the water.

58
00:03:50,273 --> 00:03:52,101
But like ships to
the lighthouse

59
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:54,190
we found our way
back to one another.

60
00:03:54,364 --> 00:03:56,497
We found our way to
a love stronger,

61
00:03:56,671 --> 00:03:59,587
better and deeper than we
ever could have imagined.

62
00:04:01,023 --> 00:04:02,764
And to find out
how we did that,

63
00:04:02,938 --> 00:04:04,374
you'll have to
buy the book.

64
00:04:05,027 --> 00:04:06,463
Now rumor on
the street is

65
00:04:06,637 --> 00:04:08,160
that you're getting
your own talk show.

66
00:04:08,335 --> 00:04:09,553
Is that true?

67
00:04:10,032 --> 00:04:11,773
You'll have to stay tuned.

68
00:04:11,947 --> 00:04:14,254
And, uh, keep an
eye on my website.

69
00:04:14,428 --> 00:04:16,168
Charlotte Meyers,
everyone, give it up.

70
00:04:17,605 --> 00:04:19,128
Thanks for being here.

71
00:04:19,302 --> 00:04:20,695
Thanks for having me.

72
00:04:22,392 --> 00:04:23,219
So good.

73
00:04:23,393 --> 00:04:24,612
Thank you.

74
00:04:24,786 --> 00:04:26,222
Okay, well we got
your photo shoot

75
00:04:26,396 --> 00:04:27,658
for the Chicago Daily
right now.

76
00:04:27,832 --> 00:04:28,529
He's set up in the
lobby for us, okay?

77
00:04:28,703 --> 00:04:29,878
Great.

78
00:04:32,663 --> 00:04:35,231
Hi, hello, we have
Charlotte Meyers here.

79
00:04:35,405 --> 00:04:36,188
And I'm Mallory,
her assistant.

80
00:04:36,363 --> 00:04:37,233
You're late.

81
00:04:37,407 --> 00:04:38,495
I know, I'm so sorry.

82
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:39,366
We were a little
bit behind.

83
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,845
You look amazing.

84
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:41,890
I've been trying to
get a hold of you.

85
00:04:42,064 --> 00:04:43,457
I need to talk to you.

86
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:44,588
I know, today was crazy,
I'm sorry.

87
00:04:44,762 --> 00:04:45,285
But let's grab dinner after.

88
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:46,416
Sit, now.

89
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,678
We're behind schedule.

90
00:04:47,852 --> 00:04:48,331
Yes, yes, I know,
I'm sorry.

91
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:49,245
Oh!

92
00:04:49,854 --> 00:04:51,900
Let's get you in here.
-Ah...

93
00:04:52,074 --> 00:04:53,815
The book is about our
relationship after all.

94
00:04:53,989 --> 00:04:54,903
I don't think
that's a good idea.

95
00:04:55,077 --> 00:04:56,121
Come on,
it'll be fun.

96
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,122
You're not
listening to me.

97
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,341
I need to talk to you.

98
00:04:58,515 --> 00:04:58,646
Okay, well what
is it then?

99
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,475
It's just, um...

100
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,304
I'm not happy, Charlotte.

101
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:06,262
You're not happy,
what do you mean?

102
00:05:06,436 --> 00:05:08,438
Is it your job,
do you need more exercise?

103
00:05:08,612 --> 00:05:11,093
It's not my job, Charlotte,
it's not exercise.

104
00:05:11,876 --> 00:05:13,051
It's us.

105
00:05:13,922 --> 00:05:15,750
I think we should break up.

106
00:05:22,017 --> 00:05:23,497
Are you serious?

107
00:05:23,671 --> 00:05:24,933
You wanna break up?

108
00:05:25,107 --> 00:05:26,935
Could you just
stop for a minute?

109
00:05:27,675 --> 00:05:28,937
Five minutes.

110
00:05:31,766 --> 00:05:34,769
Are you seriously doing this
the day my book launches?

111
00:05:34,943 --> 00:05:36,466
The book about
our relationship

112
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,555
where we-we-we salvaged
it and got engaged?

113
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:40,252
The book that got
me my TV show?

114
00:05:40,427 --> 00:05:41,602
I know the timing
isn't ideal.

115
00:05:41,776 --> 00:05:42,994
Ideal?

116
00:05:43,517 --> 00:05:45,432
Doug, we're getting
married in a month!

117
00:05:49,523 --> 00:05:51,133
Why are you doing
this to me?

118
00:05:52,526 --> 00:05:53,527
It's not you.

119
00:05:54,658 --> 00:05:55,746
Really, it's me.

120
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,747
Sure.

121
00:05:56,921 --> 00:05:58,488
Seriously, Char.

122
00:05:58,662 --> 00:05:59,881
You're perfect.

123
00:06:00,795 --> 00:06:03,580
You're brilliant,
you're beautiful.

124
00:06:03,754 --> 00:06:05,365
My parents love you.

125
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:06,496
Yeah, great.

126
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,804
I should be happy.

127
00:06:13,677 --> 00:06:14,852
But I'm not.

128
00:06:17,551 --> 00:06:21,555
I think I loved the idea of us
more than the reality of us.

129
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:22,599
I'm sorry.

130
00:06:22,773 --> 00:06:24,296
Just go.

131
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:25,472
Go.

132
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:35,482
I'll, uh, get my mother to
cancel all the wedding plans.

133
00:06:39,747 --> 00:06:41,226
I could have died.

134
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:44,752
What kind of racket are
you guys running here?

135
00:06:44,926 --> 00:06:47,232
He tipped my
canoe on purpose.

136
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,756
I lost everything!

137
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,453
Ma'am it's just a phone.

138
00:06:50,627 --> 00:06:51,367
You're just a
little shaken up.

139
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,369
I'm hypothermic!

140
00:06:53,543 --> 00:06:55,502
It's 75 degrees outside.

141
00:06:55,676 --> 00:06:56,590
You just need to take
off your life jacket

142
00:06:56,764 --> 00:06:57,895
and go stand in the sun.

143
00:06:58,069 --> 00:06:59,767
I'm not paying for this.

144
00:06:59,941 --> 00:07:02,030
I mean, are these
canoes even up to code?

145
00:07:02,204 --> 00:07:04,032
Uh uh, you bet
your bum they are,

146
00:07:04,206 --> 00:07:05,860
pardon my English.

147
00:07:06,034 --> 00:07:08,471
They're brand new
and top of the line.

148
00:07:08,645 --> 00:07:11,431
You shouldn't have been
taking selfies on the boat.

149
00:07:11,605 --> 00:07:13,998
You think that's the first
time that this has happened?

150
00:07:14,172 --> 00:07:16,131
That's why we have a
no selfies policy.

151
00:07:17,872 --> 00:07:19,439
You will pay full price

152
00:07:19,613 --> 00:07:23,312
or I will send you
to collections, mhm.

153
00:07:23,486 --> 00:07:24,574
Now when you're
all settled up

154
00:07:24,748 --> 00:07:26,271
join us for lunch
in the pub.

155
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,447
It's on the house.

156
00:07:42,505 --> 00:07:44,072
Thank you,
have a nice day.

157
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:46,030
Enjoy your lunch.

158
00:07:51,645 --> 00:07:53,864
Why are people always
trying to get out of paying?

159
00:07:54,038 --> 00:07:56,824
'Cause they don't respect
our time or our work.

160
00:07:56,998 --> 00:07:58,652
Or nature for that matter.

161
00:07:58,826 --> 00:08:00,654
Ah, they're not all bad.

162
00:08:00,828 --> 00:08:03,570
I find most people to have
a redeeming quality or two.

163
00:08:04,832 --> 00:08:06,442
By the way,

164
00:08:06,616 --> 00:08:08,313
there's another message
for you on the machine.

165
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,663
Sarah again.

166
00:08:09,837 --> 00:08:11,142
Thanks.

167
00:08:11,316 --> 00:08:12,883
Are you planning on
calling her back?

168
00:08:13,057 --> 00:08:14,885
She's been trying
you for weeks.

169
00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:16,713
No, I'm just not looking for
anything like that right now.

170
00:08:16,887 --> 00:08:19,847
Hmm, when will you be looking
for something like that?

171
00:08:20,674 --> 00:08:22,589
Hey Mike, do you wanna
hand me that ketchup?

172
00:09:04,108 --> 00:09:06,154
Hey bro, long time no talk.

173
00:09:06,328 --> 00:09:08,939
Hi Rob, I don't
wanna worry you,

174
00:09:09,113 --> 00:09:11,551
but Dad's had a
bit of a fall.

175
00:09:11,725 --> 00:09:13,335
I'll be on the
first flight out.

176
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:17,513
I can't believe it.

177
00:09:17,687 --> 00:09:19,471
We've all been there, sweetie.

178
00:09:19,646 --> 00:09:21,038
I'm sure you're devastated.

179
00:09:21,212 --> 00:09:22,605
Who am I to give
love advice

180
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:24,607
if I can't even keep
my own fiancee?

181
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,437
But you're upset about
the engagement too, right?

182
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:30,352
Of course.

183
00:09:30,526 --> 00:09:32,746
I'm just trying to keep my
entire life from imploding here.

184
00:09:35,836 --> 00:09:37,925
I just got off the
phone with the network.

185
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:39,796
They somehow heard
about the breakup.

186
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,755
Well what did they say?

187
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:43,234
They wanna put the
talk show on hold.

188
00:09:43,408 --> 00:09:44,584
But just until this
all blows over.

189
00:09:44,758 --> 00:09:46,803
That's it, that
means it's over.

190
00:09:46,977 --> 00:09:48,500
No, it's not over.

191
00:09:48,675 --> 00:09:50,067
We'll revisit it
in a few months.

192
00:09:50,241 --> 00:09:52,766
No, my career is finished,
I'm-I'm done!

193
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,071
I'm done.

194
00:09:54,245 --> 00:09:56,117
Hey, we can manage this,
okay?

195
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,685
I pushed the interview with
the Chicago Daily 'til Monday

196
00:09:58,859 --> 00:10:00,164
so that gives us a few
days to figure out

197
00:10:00,338 --> 00:10:01,731
how to spin this.

198
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:03,777
In the meantime,
get some sleep, okay?

199
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:05,561
We'll meet with the
publisher in the morning.

200
00:10:05,735 --> 00:10:06,693
Okay.

201
00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:09,609
You're gonna get
through this.

202
00:10:09,783 --> 00:10:11,698
You'll come out on top,
you always do.

203
00:10:14,744 --> 00:10:15,571
Oh.

204
00:10:24,101 --> 00:10:25,276
Dad?

205
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,803
Dad?

206
00:10:29,977 --> 00:10:31,239
Hey.

207
00:10:31,413 --> 00:10:32,719
Dad, what happened?

208
00:10:32,893 --> 00:10:34,198
I fell off the roof.

209
00:10:34,372 --> 00:10:36,026
Dang gutters.

210
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,767
You know there's people you
can pay to do that, right?

211
00:10:37,941 --> 00:10:39,595
Yeah, there's toilets you
can flush money down too.

212
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:40,944
Doesn't mean I'm
gonna do it.

213
00:10:42,772 --> 00:10:43,947
Hey, Bro.

214
00:10:45,819 --> 00:10:47,603
Well the surgery
went well.

215
00:10:47,777 --> 00:10:48,778
I got 10 screws.

216
00:10:49,126 --> 00:10:50,475
Oh.

217
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,738
But we got another problem.

218
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,870
Do I wanna know?

219
00:10:54,044 --> 00:10:54,915
Dad doesn't have
health insurance.

220
00:10:55,742 --> 00:10:58,005
Apparently he lost his
job a few months ago.

221
00:10:58,179 --> 00:10:59,615
Dad, why didn't
you tell us that?

222
00:10:59,789 --> 00:11:01,008
It's no big deal.

223
00:11:01,182 --> 00:11:02,618
I was gonna retire
soon anyway.

224
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:04,533
Not a big deal?

225
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:06,187
Dad, your Medicare doesn't
kick in until your birthday.

226
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:08,058
I just got laid off
a few months ago.

227
00:11:08,232 --> 00:11:10,060
I hadn't figured
that part out yet.

228
00:11:10,234 --> 00:11:12,759
Well how are we gonna
pay for this surgery then?

229
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:14,369
Don't you worry about it.

230
00:11:14,848 --> 00:11:16,806
That's my problem,
not yours.

231
00:11:19,069 --> 00:11:20,070
He dumped you.

232
00:11:20,244 --> 00:11:21,245
This is not a good look.

233
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:23,030
I know.

234
00:11:23,204 --> 00:11:24,335
The book is about making
a struggling relationship

235
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:25,815
whole again.
- Right.

236
00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:26,424
The engagement is
the selling feature.

237
00:11:26,598 --> 00:11:28,209
Yes.

238
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:28,862
But you're not
engaged anymore.

239
00:11:29,036 --> 00:11:29,863
No.

240
00:11:30,037 --> 00:11:31,734
This is not a good look.

241
00:11:31,908 --> 00:11:32,735
What do you
suggest we do?

242
00:11:33,736 --> 00:11:35,607
Well I say we cut our
losses on this one.

243
00:11:35,782 --> 00:11:37,174
Cancel the promos,
pull the marketing.

244
00:11:37,348 --> 00:11:39,089
There's no sense
feeding a dying cow.

245
00:11:39,263 --> 00:11:40,612
The book, not you.

246
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:43,050
So you just
wanna give up?

247
00:11:44,181 --> 00:11:45,617
What if I still
wanna promote it?

248
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:47,707
Oh, oh honey no,
no, no, no.

249
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:49,186
Do yourself a favor,

250
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,318
stay far away
from that book.

251
00:11:50,492 --> 00:11:51,841
It's a bomb.

252
00:11:53,756 --> 00:11:56,759
Well, um, that's a bummer.

253
00:11:57,978 --> 00:12:00,720
Maybe we should start to
think about the next book.

254
00:12:00,894 --> 00:12:02,809
Use the Daily Article to,

255
00:12:02,983 --> 00:12:04,288
to announce it

256
00:12:04,462 --> 00:12:06,029
and distract people
from the breakup.

257
00:12:06,203 --> 00:12:07,552
I started working on an
outline and I think it's-

258
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,511
Yeah maybe we should
put a pin in that.

259
00:12:11,121 --> 00:12:12,688
What-what do you mean?

260
00:12:12,862 --> 00:12:14,124
I mean, maybe,
you know,

261
00:12:14,298 --> 00:12:16,431
lay off the relationship
advice for a bit.

262
00:12:17,084 --> 00:12:18,085
Jane, what are you saying?

263
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:19,129
Look, Charlotte, I like you

264
00:12:19,303 --> 00:12:20,957
but I run a business.

265
00:12:21,131 --> 00:12:23,003
You can't pretend to be
an expert on relationships

266
00:12:23,177 --> 00:12:25,179
when you can't even
manage your own.

267
00:12:25,353 --> 00:12:27,355
Now you've always been
on shaky ground with Doug

268
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:30,097
but it's not like your
past dating history

269
00:12:30,271 --> 00:12:31,794
was that much better.

270
00:12:31,968 --> 00:12:33,230
And when you're
young and single,

271
00:12:33,404 --> 00:12:34,928
it's fine,
it's relatable even.

272
00:12:35,102 --> 00:12:36,799
But the older you get,

273
00:12:36,973 --> 00:12:38,888
it'll just be the final
nail in the coffin.

274
00:12:41,021 --> 00:12:42,326
So what are you saying?

275
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,285
You're not gonna publish
my books anymore?

276
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:46,156
Well, unless you can wow me with
something new and original,

277
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,332
and preferably having
absolutely nothing

278
00:12:48,506 --> 00:12:49,856
to do with relationships,

279
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,945
probably not.

280
00:12:57,124 --> 00:12:58,560
He's finally asleep.

281
00:12:59,387 --> 00:13:00,692
A support nurse will
be here in a few hours

282
00:13:00,867 --> 00:13:02,607
to wake him up for
his pain meds.

283
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,000
Good, good.

284
00:13:04,174 --> 00:13:05,785
Well I'm glad you
hired some help.

285
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:07,264
I just wish I
could stay longer.

286
00:13:07,438 --> 00:13:08,788
Well you gotta
get back to work.

287
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:11,268
It's fine,

288
00:13:11,442 --> 00:13:12,182
I don't see enough
of you these days.

289
00:13:12,356 --> 00:13:13,923
Yeah.

290
00:13:14,097 --> 00:13:15,446
I've got a bit of time,
do you wanna grab a beer?

291
00:13:16,186 --> 00:13:18,101
I think we could do
better than that.

292
00:13:24,412 --> 00:13:25,848
Put me in
this straitjacket,

293
00:13:26,022 --> 00:13:27,719
how am I supposed to
relax in this thing?

294
00:13:27,894 --> 00:13:29,330
Don't take that jacket off.

295
00:13:29,504 --> 00:13:31,288
You're already pushing
it in those shoes.

296
00:13:31,462 --> 00:13:32,594
If you try to put those other
boats on me one more time,

297
00:13:32,768 --> 00:13:33,769
I will leave right now,
I swear.

298
00:13:33,943 --> 00:13:35,031
Relax, relax.

299
00:13:35,205 --> 00:13:37,425
I won't,
you're so dramatic, Rob.

300
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:39,731
I-I forgot my
wallet in the car.

301
00:13:39,906 --> 00:13:41,385
Bar's on the third floor,
go grab us a table, okay?

302
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:42,952
Yeah, yeah.

303
00:13:48,044 --> 00:13:50,003
I just don't feel like
socializing, Mallory.

304
00:13:50,177 --> 00:13:51,787
We're not socializing.

305
00:13:51,961 --> 00:13:53,876
We're brainstorming the ways
to turn this all around.

306
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,051
Take control of
your narrative,

307
00:13:55,225 --> 00:13:57,401
plot your comeback.

308
00:13:57,575 --> 00:13:58,315
Yeah but I don't know
how to put a positive spin

309
00:13:58,489 --> 00:13:59,316
on getting dumped.

310
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:00,752
We'll figure it out.

311
00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:01,841
I have to use the bathroom.

312
00:14:02,015 --> 00:14:02,842
Can you get us a table?

313
00:14:03,016 --> 00:14:04,147
It's on the third floor.

314
00:14:04,974 --> 00:14:06,323
Wait, hold it!

315
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:09,892
Thank you.

316
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:11,285
Sure.

317
00:14:17,944 --> 00:14:18,945
Whoa.

318
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,555
Huh.

319
00:14:23,645 --> 00:14:25,821
Ah, I'm sure they'll
fix it soon.

320
00:14:25,995 --> 00:14:26,996
I hope so.

321
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,476
I'm a little claustrophobic.

322
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,145
Woo!

323
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:46,929
Is it hot in here?

324
00:14:48,278 --> 00:14:50,237
Where are these people?

325
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:51,978
It's been like an hour.

326
00:14:52,152 --> 00:14:53,936
Ah, it's been 30 seconds.

327
00:15:03,511 --> 00:15:06,079
Hey hey hey, hey,
it's gonna be okay.

328
00:15:06,253 --> 00:15:07,863
Just try breathing.

329
00:15:08,037 --> 00:15:10,083
Close your eyes
and count to ten.

330
00:15:10,257 --> 00:15:11,214
One, two, three,
four, five, six-

331
00:15:11,388 --> 00:15:12,912
No, not working!

332
00:15:13,086 --> 00:15:16,089
Help, somebody help us!

333
00:15:16,263 --> 00:15:17,264
I'd hate to see
what you're like

334
00:15:17,438 --> 00:15:18,787
in a real emergency.

335
00:15:24,184 --> 00:15:25,837
Hi, is this
the front desk?

336
00:15:26,012 --> 00:15:28,536
Hi, yeah, we're stuck in
your elevator right now.

337
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:30,538
Not moving, no.

338
00:15:30,712 --> 00:15:32,018
Could ya? Yeah.

339
00:15:32,192 --> 00:15:33,889
Great, okay,
thanks so much.

340
00:15:34,063 --> 00:15:35,238
See you soon.

341
00:15:36,152 --> 00:15:37,545
They're on their way.

342
00:15:39,112 --> 00:15:40,069
Oh.

343
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,028
Thank you.

344
00:15:42,202 --> 00:15:43,377
You're welcome.

345
00:15:44,117 --> 00:15:46,510
First step in an emergency
is to keep your cool.

346
00:15:46,684 --> 00:15:48,817
There's often an easy
solution within grasp

347
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,601
if your mind is clear
enough to find it.

348
00:15:50,775 --> 00:15:52,473
I'll make sure to let my
nervous system know next time.

349
00:15:52,647 --> 00:15:54,040
Thank you.

350
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,086
No problem.

351
00:15:58,305 --> 00:16:00,350
So what are you,
an EMT or something?

352
00:16:00,524 --> 00:16:02,091
Wilderness Guide.

353
00:16:03,136 --> 00:16:04,920
I teach survival skills
and take people

354
00:16:05,094 --> 00:16:06,226
on guided
wilderness tours.

355
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,879
Well that's fun.

356
00:16:08,054 --> 00:16:09,881
Maybe I should take
one of your classes.

357
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:12,101
Eh, it's not really fun.

358
00:16:13,276 --> 00:16:15,235
I'm not sure a city girl
like you would enjoy it.

359
00:16:15,713 --> 00:16:16,627
Excuse me?

360
00:16:16,801 --> 00:16:18,107
I don't mean any offense.

361
00:16:18,281 --> 00:16:19,935
I just, I don't
think you'd like it.

362
00:16:22,111 --> 00:16:23,504
Oh, here we go.

363
00:16:25,201 --> 00:16:26,507
Have a good one.

364
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:37,257
There you are,

365
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:38,867
I was starting
to get worried.

366
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,478
I just met the rudest man.

367
00:16:41,652 --> 00:16:43,393
I got stuck on the
elevator with this-

368
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:45,047
Total city chick.

369
00:16:45,221 --> 00:16:49,008
Just like designer this,
high heels that.

370
00:16:49,182 --> 00:16:51,227
I mean, sorry we're not
all wilderness guides

371
00:16:51,401 --> 00:16:52,924
or whatever he said.

372
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:54,361
Like excuse me for having
an emotional reaction

373
00:16:54,535 --> 00:16:56,319
to a life threatening situation,
you know?

374
00:16:56,493 --> 00:17:00,019
I mean, she just lost it,
like truly lost it.

375
00:17:00,193 --> 00:17:02,978
She was trying to pry the doors
open with her fingernails.

376
00:17:03,152 --> 00:17:04,153
And then he said this.

377
00:17:04,327 --> 00:17:05,937
He called me "a city girl".

378
00:17:06,112 --> 00:17:07,809
Like it's some
sort of an insult,

379
00:17:07,983 --> 00:17:09,854
like I couldn't hack it on
a camping trip or something.

380
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,291
I mean, come on.

381
00:17:11,465 --> 00:17:12,466
I think I may have
offended her,

382
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,033
but I was just being honest.

383
00:17:14,207 --> 00:17:16,470
I'm so sick of these
tourists coming in

384
00:17:16,644 --> 00:17:18,994
and then crying when
things don't go their way.

385
00:17:19,168 --> 00:17:20,735
Well aren't tourists
your whole business?

386
00:17:22,737 --> 00:17:24,391
Yes.

387
00:17:24,565 --> 00:17:26,393
Well now I need their
money to help Dad.

388
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:28,003
How hard could it
be to start a fire

389
00:17:28,177 --> 00:17:29,396
or catch a fish?

390
00:17:30,223 --> 00:17:31,963
My dad taught me that
when I was five.

391
00:17:32,138 --> 00:17:34,053
The city girl and
the wilderness guy.

392
00:17:35,532 --> 00:17:37,186
That sounds like a
great idea for a-

393
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,535
Book.

394
00:17:38,709 --> 00:17:40,189
Oh my god.

395
00:17:40,363 --> 00:17:42,713
"The City Girl's Guide
to Wilderness Survival."

396
00:17:43,453 --> 00:17:44,889
That's my next book!

397
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,066
I love it, that's it.

398
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,850
I just need a
wilderness guide.

399
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,248
Hi, I don't think
we officially met.

400
00:17:55,422 --> 00:17:56,597
I'm Charlotte.

401
00:17:59,165 --> 00:18:00,035
Rob.

402
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:01,036
Ben.

403
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,125
Mallory.

404
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:04,257
I wanted to thank
you for your help

405
00:18:04,431 --> 00:18:05,649
in the elevator back there.

406
00:18:05,823 --> 00:18:06,955
I'm sure when
you insulted me

407
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:08,217
you were just
having a bad day

408
00:18:08,391 --> 00:18:09,566
and taking it out on me.

409
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,915
And that's a thank you?

410
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,091
I actually wanted
to talk to you

411
00:18:12,265 --> 00:18:13,962
about an amazing opportunity.

412
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:16,007
Yeah, we were actually just
thinking about leaving.

413
00:18:16,182 --> 00:18:17,444
I don't think you
recognize me.

414
00:18:17,618 --> 00:18:19,402
I'm Charlotte Meyers,
the author.

415
00:18:19,576 --> 00:18:20,925
Lasting Love?

416
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,275
Growing, Together?

417
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:24,015
I have a huge
online following,

418
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,060
a podcast?

419
00:18:25,234 --> 00:18:26,017
I'm sorry.
-No?

420
00:18:26,192 --> 00:18:27,410
No idea.

421
00:18:28,281 --> 00:18:30,239
Well, I'm writing
a new book.

422
00:18:30,413 --> 00:18:32,067
"The City Girl's Guide
to Wilderness Survival"

423
00:18:32,241 --> 00:18:33,590
and I need a teacher.

424
00:18:33,764 --> 00:18:34,635
And that teacher
could be you.

425
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:36,245
What do you say?

426
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:38,682
You're writing a book
about wilderness survival?

427
00:18:38,856 --> 00:18:40,249
I sure am.

428
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,208
No thanks.

429
00:18:42,382 --> 00:18:43,600
We really gotta get going.

430
00:18:43,774 --> 00:18:45,515
It was so nice to
meet you ladies.

431
00:18:45,689 --> 00:18:47,256
Be safe out there and, uh,

432
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,389
watch out for those
elevators, huh?

433
00:18:52,653 --> 00:18:54,220
It pays good money!

434
00:18:57,527 --> 00:18:59,355
How much?

435
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:03,011
Thirty days in the wilderness
of Northern Minnesota.

436
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:06,014
I'll spend the first three
weeks learning survival skills

437
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:09,017
and the last week will
be a 30 mile canoe trip

438
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:10,932
through the
Superior National Forest

439
00:19:11,106 --> 00:19:14,240
where I'll sleep under the
stars and catch my own meals.

440
00:19:16,938 --> 00:19:18,331
And it has nothing to
do with relationships?

441
00:19:18,505 --> 00:19:19,462
Nope.

442
00:19:19,636 --> 00:19:20,898
No love, no feelings,

443
00:19:21,072 --> 00:19:22,639
just straight up
survival techniques.

444
00:19:27,296 --> 00:19:28,123
I love it.

445
00:19:28,297 --> 00:19:30,343
Really?

446
00:19:30,517 --> 00:19:31,344
Yes, it's dangerous,
it's different, it's fun.

447
00:19:31,518 --> 00:19:33,302
I love it.

448
00:19:33,476 --> 00:19:34,738
Now you have the Chicago Daily
interview tomorrow, right?

449
00:19:34,912 --> 00:19:35,870
Yes.

450
00:19:36,044 --> 00:19:37,263
Okay.

451
00:19:37,437 --> 00:19:38,786
Use that to
announce the book.

452
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,179
Ooh, and really lean into that,
you know,

453
00:19:40,353 --> 00:19:42,006
single girl in
the city thing.

454
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,357
Maybe we can use this breakup
to our advantage, ladies.

455
00:19:45,314 --> 00:19:46,272
Yes!

456
00:19:54,628 --> 00:19:56,238
Ah, ah, ah, ah-

457
00:19:56,673 --> 00:19:58,371
That's the woman that
you're babysitting

458
00:19:58,545 --> 00:20:00,024
for the next month?

459
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,548
I don't get it, why?

460
00:20:01,722 --> 00:20:03,158
Trust me, I'm not
looking forward to it.

461
00:20:03,332 --> 00:20:04,725
I need the money
to help Dad.

462
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,162
Ummm, still doesn't
make any sense to me.

463
00:20:09,382 --> 00:20:10,383
Do you like her?

464
00:20:10,557 --> 00:20:11,601
Absolutely not.

465
00:20:11,775 --> 00:20:13,864
She is not my type at all.

466
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:15,605
Nah, I can't believe you're
letting some big city author

467
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:16,606
write a book about you.

468
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,347
No, no, no, no, no.

469
00:20:18,521 --> 00:20:21,176
Under no circumstances is
she allowed to name me,

470
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,177
feature me,

471
00:20:22,351 --> 00:20:24,179
talk about me.

472
00:20:24,353 --> 00:20:26,573
I'm to be referred to
exclusively as "the guide".

473
00:20:26,747 --> 00:20:29,271
Huh, so when does
she get here?

474
00:20:29,445 --> 00:20:30,664
Any minute now.

475
00:20:31,491 --> 00:20:33,580
You guys'll be nice
to her, right?

476
00:20:33,754 --> 00:20:34,755
I have a feeling
she's gonna stick out

477
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:36,278
like a sore thumb.

478
00:20:36,452 --> 00:20:37,192
Let's not make it
any harder on her.

479
00:20:37,366 --> 00:20:38,541
Well, for sure.

480
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:41,240
We're Minnesotans,
we're always nice!

481
00:20:41,414 --> 00:20:42,415
Mhm.
-Right.

482
00:20:51,424 --> 00:20:52,381
Hello!

483
00:21:00,781 --> 00:21:01,956
Wow!

484
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:07,831
Ooh!

485
00:21:08,005 --> 00:21:09,224
Oh!
- Welcome.

486
00:21:09,398 --> 00:21:10,356
Thank you.

487
00:21:13,228 --> 00:21:14,621
How many bags
did you bring?

488
00:21:14,795 --> 00:21:16,231
You know you're only
here a month, right?

489
00:21:16,405 --> 00:21:17,580
Always be prepared,

490
00:21:17,754 --> 00:21:19,321
that's what my
dad taught me.

491
00:21:19,495 --> 00:21:21,236
You never know what
you might need.

492
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:23,412
Oh, this place is beautiful!

493
00:21:24,457 --> 00:21:26,372
I'm looking forward
to a little R and R.

494
00:21:28,461 --> 00:21:29,592
R and R, right.

495
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:36,730
Well, here it is.

496
00:21:40,647 --> 00:21:42,431
It's quaint.

497
00:21:47,697 --> 00:21:50,178
Um, there's extra
blankets in the closet

498
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:52,659
and I've stocked the
fridge with some basics.

499
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:55,705
If you want more food there's
a grocery store in town.

500
00:21:56,402 --> 00:21:57,838
How far is town?

501
00:21:58,012 --> 00:21:59,448
About five miles,
give or take.

502
00:21:59,622 --> 00:22:01,015
I don't have a car.

503
00:22:02,451 --> 00:22:03,626
Your legs work, right?

504
00:22:04,932 --> 00:22:06,542
Yeah, I love walking.

505
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:10,851
There's no wi-fi and cell
reception is spotty at best,

506
00:22:11,025 --> 00:22:12,722
but you're welcome to use the
landline in the main lodge

507
00:22:12,896 --> 00:22:13,723
whenever you like.

508
00:22:13,897 --> 00:22:15,899
There's no wi-fi?

509
00:22:16,073 --> 00:22:17,423
Is that a problem?

510
00:22:19,512 --> 00:22:21,340
No, I've been wanting
to "disconnect" anyway.

511
00:22:21,514 --> 00:22:23,342
It's great.
-Perfect.

512
00:22:23,516 --> 00:22:25,300
There's the bathroom.

513
00:22:25,474 --> 00:22:26,519
You get a solid three
minutes of hot water a day

514
00:22:26,693 --> 00:22:28,608
so use your time wisely.

515
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:31,437
There's no mirror in here.

516
00:22:31,611 --> 00:22:32,786
And?

517
00:22:34,483 --> 00:22:35,658
Just an observation.

518
00:22:37,573 --> 00:22:38,966
All right you should
get some sleep.

519
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,315
We start early tomorrow.

520
00:22:40,489 --> 00:22:41,664
Great, I'm an early riser.

521
00:22:41,838 --> 00:22:43,013
Five a.m.

522
00:22:44,972 --> 00:22:47,322
That's, uh, practically
sleeping in for me.

523
00:22:47,496 --> 00:22:48,671
Okay.

524
00:22:49,846 --> 00:22:51,021
Good night.

525
00:22:58,899 --> 00:23:00,466
Basics, huh?

526
00:23:10,737 --> 00:23:12,695
What can I make with
a tomato, an onion,

527
00:23:12,869 --> 00:23:14,828
a cucumber and beef?

528
00:23:15,002 --> 00:23:16,307
What about like,

529
00:23:16,482 --> 00:23:17,657
I don't know,
something Greek.

530
00:23:17,831 --> 00:23:19,006
Like a Greek salad
with beef in it?

531
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,703
That would be so good,

532
00:23:20,877 --> 00:23:22,923
but the feta cheese
is five miles away.

533
00:23:23,097 --> 00:23:24,054
Sorry, what's that?

534
00:23:24,228 --> 00:23:25,795
I-I can't really hear you.

535
00:23:25,969 --> 00:23:27,884
Ugh, you're kind
of breaking up.

536
00:23:28,058 --> 00:23:30,626
Ugh, the service
here is terrible.

537
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,062
I've been using
my data plan

538
00:23:32,236 --> 00:23:33,716
and it's gonna
cost me a fortune.

539
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,501
Can you send me
a wi-fi router?

540
00:23:35,675 --> 00:23:37,241
Yeah, you got it, boss.

541
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,547
How's the cabin?

542
00:23:39,156 --> 00:23:40,810
It's, it's cute!

543
00:23:40,984 --> 00:23:42,899
It's-it's really cute.

544
00:23:43,073 --> 00:23:44,335
And since I'm gonna
be here for a while

545
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,381
I was thinking
of going to town

546
00:23:46,555 --> 00:23:48,383
and buying some stuff,
you know,

547
00:23:48,557 --> 00:23:50,385
give it a little
Charlotte vibe.

548
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,039
Mm, that sounds fun.

549
00:23:52,996 --> 00:23:54,476
Yeah, super fun.

550
00:23:55,825 --> 00:23:57,740
What are you up to?
You look amazing!

551
00:23:57,914 --> 00:24:01,352
Oh, tonight's the Children's
Foundation Gala, remember?

552
00:24:01,527 --> 00:24:04,443
Ah, yeah,
Sasha's annual gala.

553
00:24:04,617 --> 00:24:06,270
I can't believe
I'm missing that.

554
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,489
You're not really
missing much.

555
00:24:07,663 --> 00:24:09,360
You know how
these things go.

556
00:24:09,535 --> 00:24:11,972
Cocktails, auctions,
hors d'oeuvres.

557
00:24:12,146 --> 00:24:13,408
It's pretty boring.

558
00:24:13,582 --> 00:24:15,236
Yeah, sounds awful.

559
00:24:15,802 --> 00:24:16,629
Well, I better go,

560
00:24:16,803 --> 00:24:18,021
I can't really hear you,

561
00:24:18,195 --> 00:24:19,458
but have a good night.

562
00:24:19,632 --> 00:24:21,024
Enjoy the peace and quiet,

563
00:24:21,198 --> 00:24:22,417
maybe you'll actually
see some stars.

564
00:24:22,591 --> 00:24:23,679
Maybe I will.

565
00:24:23,853 --> 00:24:25,246
Have fun tonight.

566
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:21,520
Okay, so, portaging is
when you carry your canoe

567
00:25:21,694 --> 00:25:23,130
over your head,

568
00:25:23,304 --> 00:25:25,524
traversing the land
between bodies of water.

569
00:25:25,698 --> 00:25:27,569
Now, when you're
picking up a canoe,

570
00:25:27,743 --> 00:25:28,918
you, um,

571
00:25:29,092 --> 00:25:30,485
okay, I'm sorry,
I can't.

572
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:32,052
What is with the outfit?

573
00:25:32,879 --> 00:25:34,358
What do you mean?

574
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,621
I mean, where do you
even get a hat like that?

575
00:25:35,795 --> 00:25:36,578
Who are you,
Indiana Jones?

576
00:25:36,752 --> 00:25:37,753
I like my hat.

577
00:25:37,927 --> 00:25:39,581
And those boots,

578
00:25:39,755 --> 00:25:41,365
you know we're getting
in the water, right?

579
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,150
I know, which is
why I paid extra

580
00:25:43,324 --> 00:25:44,760
for the waterproofing.

581
00:25:44,934 --> 00:25:46,806
Can we-can we
please continue?

582
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,372
Portaging, you were saying.

583
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,026
Yeah, so,

584
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,724
when you're lifting a
canoe over your head

585
00:25:51,898 --> 00:25:53,508
there are three words
you need to remember.

586
00:25:53,682 --> 00:25:56,729
Gunnel, hips and yoke.

587
00:25:56,903 --> 00:25:59,601
You grab the gunnel
with one hand.

588
00:25:59,775 --> 00:26:02,517
Bring it around,
grab the other side.

589
00:26:02,691 --> 00:26:04,127
Bring it up to
your thighs,

590
00:26:04,301 --> 00:26:06,042
and then you use your
hips to hoist it up

591
00:26:06,216 --> 00:26:07,696
and over your head.

592
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:10,656
And you stand
under the yoke.

593
00:26:11,744 --> 00:26:13,528
Just like that,
got it?

594
00:26:13,702 --> 00:26:14,703
Sure thing.

595
00:26:14,877 --> 00:26:16,531
Gunnel, hips, yoke.

596
00:26:16,705 --> 00:26:18,620
Now you probably won't be
able to lift it on your own,

597
00:26:18,794 --> 00:26:20,448
so we'll just go
into a two person-

598
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:22,058
Cool, like this?

599
00:26:22,972 --> 00:26:24,887
Yeah, that was, uh, that
was perfect, actually.

600
00:26:25,888 --> 00:26:27,063
Thank you.

601
00:26:27,716 --> 00:26:28,848
You're pretty strong.

602
00:26:29,022 --> 00:26:30,023
I hope so.

603
00:26:30,197 --> 00:26:31,111
I work out six days a week.

604
00:26:31,285 --> 00:26:32,634
Oh, okay.

605
00:26:32,808 --> 00:26:33,635
Are we doing this?

606
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:35,550
Well, moving on then.

607
00:26:35,724 --> 00:26:36,986
This way?
- Yeah.

608
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,727
Here we go!

609
00:26:42,078 --> 00:26:43,689
Sure, lead the way.

610
00:26:44,298 --> 00:26:45,691
I got this!

611
00:26:47,823 --> 00:26:50,609
Okay, now, the J stroke
is when you-

612
00:26:50,783 --> 00:26:52,567
Is when you want to
keep the boat straight

613
00:26:52,741 --> 00:26:53,873
without losing speed, right?

614
00:26:54,047 --> 00:26:55,222
Like this?

615
00:26:56,397 --> 00:26:57,790
Yeah, how'd you know that?

616
00:26:58,834 --> 00:27:00,488
I did a little research.

617
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:02,621
Couldn't help myself.

618
00:27:02,795 --> 00:27:04,535
Let me guess, you were
a straight A student.

619
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:05,972
Valedictorian.

620
00:27:06,146 --> 00:27:07,495
Not that it matters.

621
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:08,670
Good for you.

622
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:11,064
I'm getting the
hang of this.

623
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:17,810
I don't mean to be
rude or anything

624
00:27:17,984 --> 00:27:20,551
but portaging and canoeing

625
00:27:20,726 --> 00:27:23,119
isn't exactly
wilderness survival.

626
00:27:23,293 --> 00:27:25,034
It is when you're a hundred
miles away from civilization

627
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:26,645
and your radios don't work.

628
00:27:26,819 --> 00:27:28,603
Besides, we're starting
with the basics.

629
00:27:28,777 --> 00:27:29,822
We'll work up to
the good stuff.

630
00:27:29,996 --> 00:27:31,780
Mmm, exciting!

631
00:27:32,781 --> 00:27:34,217
All right,
let's row it in.

632
00:27:35,001 --> 00:27:37,046
You've had a long day
and you deserve a rest.

633
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,831
Um, and we're
actually throwing you

634
00:27:39,005 --> 00:27:40,267
a welcome dinner
tonight at the pub,

635
00:27:40,441 --> 00:27:41,703
so you can come out
and meet everyone.

636
00:27:41,877 --> 00:27:43,270
A what?

637
00:27:43,444 --> 00:27:45,838
That's so sweet,
thank you.

638
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:47,840
Great.

639
00:27:48,318 --> 00:27:50,277
Why don't you lead the way,
J stroke?

640
00:27:50,451 --> 00:27:51,495
All right!

641
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,888
Valedictorian.

642
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,455
Follow me.

643
00:28:00,766 --> 00:28:03,769
Day one was a raging-

644
00:28:05,814 --> 00:28:10,166
No, a roaring success.

645
00:28:10,863 --> 00:28:18,784
Having successfully proved
that despite my city girl ways-

646
00:28:20,829 --> 00:28:26,661
Nay, perhaps because of them,

647
00:28:26,835 --> 00:28:32,798
I was a force to
be reckoned with.

648
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:50,250
Just a little snooze.

649
00:28:59,346 --> 00:29:01,914
I am so sorry I'm late,
I overslept.

650
00:29:02,088 --> 00:29:03,524
All that portaging.

651
00:29:04,438 --> 00:29:05,787
It's okay, really.

652
00:29:05,961 --> 00:29:07,702
Although we did
already eat, sorry.

653
00:29:07,876 --> 00:29:10,096
Ooh, I feel terrible.

654
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:11,880
And all this for me?

655
00:29:12,272 --> 00:29:13,882
It's okay, really, hi.

656
00:29:14,056 --> 00:29:15,754
I'm Tina.

657
00:29:15,928 --> 00:29:17,930
Mike and I, we co-own the
resort and pub here with Rob.

658
00:29:18,104 --> 00:29:20,715
I'm Charlotte, it's
so nice to meet you.

659
00:29:20,889 --> 00:29:22,108
Hi.
-Nice to meet you as well.

660
00:29:22,282 --> 00:29:24,284
That is a gorgeous outfit.

661
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:25,720
I'll make up a plate for you,
there's plenty of food left.

662
00:29:25,894 --> 00:29:27,200
Oh, thank you.

663
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,681
Can I get you a drink?

664
00:29:30,856 --> 00:29:31,987
Ah, yes.
-Yeah?

665
00:29:33,075 --> 00:29:34,033
A glass of wine
or something?

666
00:29:34,207 --> 00:29:34,947
White wine,
thank you.

667
00:29:35,121 --> 00:29:36,252
You got it.

668
00:29:36,426 --> 00:29:37,297
Thank you.

669
00:29:39,821 --> 00:29:41,214
They'll warm up to ya.

670
00:29:43,477 --> 00:29:46,175
Might help if you try to
blend in a little bit though.

671
00:29:46,349 --> 00:29:47,829
Blend in how?

672
00:29:48,003 --> 00:29:50,876
Well, you could wear
less makeup for starters.

673
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:53,661
It's tinted moisturizer.

674
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:55,097
Lose the high heels maybe.

675
00:29:55,576 --> 00:29:56,969
It's a special occasion.

676
00:29:57,143 --> 00:29:58,361
There you go.

677
00:29:58,535 --> 00:30:01,712
I'm so hungry,
thank you.

678
00:30:01,887 --> 00:30:03,802
You know, I couldn't
help but overhear

679
00:30:03,976 --> 00:30:05,716
your conversation
with Rob.

680
00:30:05,891 --> 00:30:08,328
There are a couple of good
local clothing stores in town

681
00:30:08,502 --> 00:30:10,765
if you wanted to get something
a little bit more comfortable.

682
00:30:10,939 --> 00:30:11,766
I could take you tomorrow.

683
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,507
I would love that.

684
00:30:13,681 --> 00:30:15,291
Is that okay
with you Sarge?

685
00:30:15,465 --> 00:30:16,989
I know that you, uh,
run a really tight ship.

686
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:18,991
I think I can spare
her for a couple hours.

687
00:30:19,165 --> 00:30:20,340
Excellent.

688
00:30:20,514 --> 00:30:21,863
Get some normal boots,
would ya?

689
00:30:22,037 --> 00:30:23,256
Yes, boss.

690
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:25,127
Is he always like that?

691
00:30:25,301 --> 00:30:26,389
Yes.

692
00:30:26,563 --> 00:30:27,956
Always.

693
00:30:31,394 --> 00:30:32,656
Not a lot of variety,

694
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,267
but I assure you the
quality's great.

695
00:30:35,268 --> 00:30:37,792
Oh, this is beautiful.

696
00:30:37,966 --> 00:30:42,144
Only 30 dollars
and it's locally made?

697
00:30:42,318 --> 00:30:45,452
Look at the quality of
this leather, it's insane.

698
00:30:45,626 --> 00:30:47,062
Just because it
doesn't cost a lot,

699
00:30:47,236 --> 00:30:48,847
doesn't mean
that it's cheap.

700
00:30:49,021 --> 00:30:49,891
You know what,
you're right.

701
00:30:50,065 --> 00:30:51,501
I'll grab a few.

702
00:30:52,024 --> 00:30:53,112
Not sure why you'd
need more than one

703
00:30:53,286 --> 00:30:54,809
but whatever
floats your boat.

704
00:30:54,983 --> 00:30:55,854
I'll give them as gifts.

705
00:30:56,028 --> 00:30:57,203
Ah.

706
00:30:58,987 --> 00:31:00,336
Hey, can I ask you something?

707
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,816
Ask away.

708
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,774
What's the deal with Rob?

709
00:31:03,949 --> 00:31:05,428
What do you mean?

710
00:31:05,602 --> 00:31:07,039
Well, he spends a lot
of time on his own.

711
00:31:07,213 --> 00:31:08,736
His family's in Chicago, right?

712
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,129
Mm.

713
00:31:10,303 --> 00:31:11,173
You and Mike have
each other here

714
00:31:11,347 --> 00:31:12,827
but who does he have?

715
00:31:13,001 --> 00:31:14,785
He used to have
someone out here.

716
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,832
They were actually engaged,
it was a guide too.

717
00:31:18,006 --> 00:31:19,486
But she had an
identity crisis,

718
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:22,054
broke off the engagement,
moved to New York.

719
00:31:22,228 --> 00:31:23,838
I think she's in
finance or something.

720
00:31:24,012 --> 00:31:24,839
Really?

721
00:31:25,013 --> 00:31:26,014
Yeah.

722
00:31:26,188 --> 00:31:27,842
Really did a number on him.

723
00:31:28,016 --> 00:31:28,843
He hasn't dated much since.

724
00:31:29,017 --> 00:31:30,584
I had no idea.

725
00:31:30,758 --> 00:31:33,065
Yeah, I don't think he
likes to talk about it.

726
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:34,066
He's a little embarrassed.

727
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,676
Yeah, I can relate.

728
00:31:37,069 --> 00:31:37,852
You know what,
you finish up here.

729
00:31:38,026 --> 00:31:39,158
Okay.
-Okay.

730
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,204
I love these, I'm gonna
grab these three.

731
00:31:43,031 --> 00:31:44,206
One, two, three.

732
00:31:46,165 --> 00:31:48,776
You are just determined to buy
out this whole town aren't you?

733
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,169
The cabin needs sprucing.

734
00:31:50,343 --> 00:31:51,518
Ah.

735
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,346
Is that for cooking?

736
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,000
It's a diffuser for
my essential oils.

737
00:31:56,044 --> 00:31:57,828
Hmm, okay, let's go.

738
00:32:32,472 --> 00:32:33,603
Hi.

739
00:32:33,777 --> 00:32:34,909
Come in.
- Hello.

740
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:36,041
Thank you.

741
00:32:40,175 --> 00:32:41,742
Wow, looks
incredible in here.

742
00:32:43,222 --> 00:32:44,919
Yeah, I-I moved
some stuff around,

743
00:32:45,093 --> 00:32:46,312
I hope you don't mind.

744
00:32:46,486 --> 00:32:47,835
I see that.

745
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:48,967
No, I love it.

746
00:32:50,055 --> 00:32:51,447
Oh, thank you.

747
00:32:52,492 --> 00:32:54,668
Can I get you a
sandwich or anything?

748
00:32:56,061 --> 00:32:58,063
No, I already ate,
but thank you.

749
00:32:58,715 --> 00:33:00,065
Are you ready for
your next lesson?

750
00:33:01,109 --> 00:33:02,067
Sure am.

751
00:33:03,024 --> 00:33:04,330
What are we doing?

752
00:33:05,157 --> 00:33:07,376
Haven't been fishing
since I was ten.

753
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,987
I used to love it.

754
00:33:10,249 --> 00:33:11,859
Why does that surprise me?

755
00:33:12,033 --> 00:33:14,209
I wasn't born in Chicago,
you know?

756
00:33:14,383 --> 00:33:15,515
I'm from Idaho,

757
00:33:15,689 --> 00:33:17,038
from a very
outdoorsy family.

758
00:33:17,212 --> 00:33:18,170
You are from Idaho?

759
00:33:18,344 --> 00:33:19,736
Yup.

760
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:20,868
How the heck did you
end up in Chicago?

761
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:22,652
After grad school

762
00:33:22,826 --> 00:33:25,003
I got a job teaching
psychology at Northwestern.

763
00:33:25,177 --> 00:33:26,526
And then I wrote
my first book

764
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,223
and the rest is history.

765
00:33:28,397 --> 00:33:30,878
I could never
live in Chicago.

766
00:33:31,052 --> 00:33:33,881
All the smog and traffic,

767
00:33:34,055 --> 00:33:37,015
construction,
and it's so crowded.

768
00:33:38,233 --> 00:33:39,626
I could never
live out here.

769
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,975
Don't get me wrong,

770
00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:42,803
it's so beautiful,
it's just-

771
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:45,153
really isolated.

772
00:33:45,327 --> 00:33:47,460
There's barely anyone here.

773
00:33:47,634 --> 00:33:50,245
One restaurant and you guys
don't even have a movie theatre.

774
00:33:50,419 --> 00:33:51,812
Hey, at least it's peaceful.

775
00:33:53,248 --> 00:33:54,815
I can hear myself
think out here.

776
00:33:57,209 --> 00:33:58,862
So it's like a,

777
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,299
like a meditation for you?

778
00:34:00,473 --> 00:34:01,648
A what?

779
00:34:01,822 --> 00:34:03,389
A meditation.

780
00:34:03,563 --> 00:34:04,738
Hold on.

781
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:09,786
Soothing Female
Close your eyes,

782
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,920
imagine you are floating
slowly above a tranquil,

783
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:15,009
serene lake.

784
00:34:15,183 --> 00:34:17,098
Why-why do you need an app

785
00:34:17,272 --> 00:34:19,187
when you can get the
real thing for free?

786
00:34:23,235 --> 00:34:26,151
It's pretty relaxing,
I'll give you that.

787
00:34:31,243 --> 00:34:33,071
Please tell me you
rented out all 30 canoes.

788
00:34:33,245 --> 00:34:34,637
Huh, what are you
talking about?

789
00:34:34,811 --> 00:34:36,117
You didn't sent them
out for maintenance,

790
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:37,031
move them somewhere
else for storage?

791
00:34:37,205 --> 00:34:38,554
No, why?

792
00:34:38,728 --> 00:34:39,512
Hide them in the kitchen?

793
00:34:42,428 --> 00:34:43,864
Where are the canoes, Mike?

794
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:46,606
You're from Chicago, right?

795
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,086
Born and raised.

796
00:34:49,217 --> 00:34:50,610
How did you end
up out here?

797
00:34:51,306 --> 00:34:53,047
My dad took Ben and
I on a trip up here

798
00:34:53,221 --> 00:34:54,962
when I was 13.

799
00:34:55,136 --> 00:34:57,095
It was just after my
mom passed away.

800
00:34:57,269 --> 00:34:59,488
I guess you could say it
was a transformative trip

801
00:34:59,662 --> 00:35:01,664
for a young city
boy like me.

802
00:35:02,535 --> 00:35:04,058
After I got back,
it's all I could think about

803
00:35:04,232 --> 00:35:06,104
and when I turned 18,

804
00:35:06,278 --> 00:35:08,889
I moved up here and I
haven't looked back.

805
00:35:10,282 --> 00:35:11,500
I'm sorry about your mom.

806
00:35:11,674 --> 00:35:13,023
It's okay.

807
00:35:13,198 --> 00:35:14,199
Thank you.

808
00:35:18,812 --> 00:35:20,335
A country girl
turned city

809
00:35:20,509 --> 00:35:22,120
and a city boy
turned country.

810
00:35:22,294 --> 00:35:24,339
We're quite the pair,
you and I.

811
00:35:24,513 --> 00:35:25,340
I guess you're right.

812
00:35:28,256 --> 00:35:29,083
Oh!

813
00:35:29,257 --> 00:35:30,476
I think I got something!

814
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,695
Reel it in.
- I think I got something!

815
00:35:32,869 --> 00:35:33,870
Oh my god!

816
00:35:34,393 --> 00:35:35,785
Reel it in!

817
00:35:38,223 --> 00:35:39,615
Look at this thing!

818
00:35:40,486 --> 00:35:41,400
Woo!

819
00:35:41,574 --> 00:35:42,314
Here, here, hold it up.

820
00:35:42,488 --> 00:35:43,924
I'll get a photo.

821
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,318
Wow!

822
00:35:47,493 --> 00:35:48,494
It's so heavy.

823
00:35:48,668 --> 00:35:49,538
Cheese.

824
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,152
Fish fry.

825
00:35:54,326 --> 00:35:55,240
Thank you.

826
00:35:58,286 --> 00:35:59,461
Woo!

827
00:36:01,376 --> 00:36:04,118
You caught a beauty, Charlotte.

828
00:36:04,292 --> 00:36:06,033
Enough for 10 people.

829
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:07,556
Thank you for cooking it.

830
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:09,123
Ah, my pleasure.

831
00:36:09,297 --> 00:36:10,864
Hey Mike, can I
get a beer please?

832
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:19,525
Mike.

833
00:36:20,917 --> 00:36:22,354
You all right?

834
00:36:22,658 --> 00:36:24,182
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm-I'm fine.

835
00:36:24,356 --> 00:36:27,141
It, sorry, it's just
this canoe stuff.

836
00:36:27,315 --> 00:36:28,969
What canoe stuff?

837
00:36:29,143 --> 00:36:31,667
Someone broke into the shed
and stole all the canoes.

838
00:36:31,841 --> 00:36:33,321
They were brand new
and top of the line.

839
00:36:33,495 --> 00:36:34,366
What?

840
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,194
Who would do that?

841
00:36:36,368 --> 00:36:37,499
A bunch of jerks,
that's who.

842
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,155
Can your insurance
reimburse you for that?

843
00:36:41,329 --> 00:36:43,505
They were so new we hadn't
updated the paperwork yet,

844
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:46,421
so we're gonna have
to pay out of pocket.

845
00:36:46,595 --> 00:36:47,988
With money we don't have.

846
00:36:49,294 --> 00:36:51,165
Well I-I can raise money.

847
00:36:51,339 --> 00:36:52,210
It's my specialty.

848
00:36:52,384 --> 00:36:54,168
Oh no, that's okay.

849
00:36:54,342 --> 00:36:55,604
We'll figure something out.

850
00:36:55,778 --> 00:36:57,302
Seriously.

851
00:36:57,476 --> 00:36:59,608
You need canoes to run
your business, right?

852
00:36:59,782 --> 00:37:01,610
What other options
do you have?

853
00:37:02,263 --> 00:37:05,223
Well we don't really have
any other options truthfully.

854
00:37:05,397 --> 00:37:06,398
Then let me help you.

855
00:37:06,572 --> 00:37:07,790
I-I'll start a GoFundMe

856
00:37:07,964 --> 00:37:09,183
and I'll send it
to all my friends.

857
00:37:09,357 --> 00:37:11,490
They love spending money.

858
00:37:11,664 --> 00:37:13,056
Really, you'd do that?

859
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,319
Yeah, I'd love to help.

860
00:37:14,493 --> 00:37:16,234
Thank you, Charlotte.

861
00:37:16,408 --> 00:37:18,018
You really are the sweetest.

862
00:37:21,282 --> 00:37:22,849
Anyone would do it, really.

863
00:37:30,378 --> 00:37:31,423
And send.

864
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,650
Hey, Mal, what's up?

865
00:37:41,824 --> 00:37:43,173
I got some bad news.

866
00:37:43,348 --> 00:37:45,175
I debated even
telling you.

867
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:46,438
What happened?

868
00:37:46,612 --> 00:37:47,787
It's Doug.

869
00:37:48,396 --> 00:37:49,571
Is he okay?

870
00:37:49,745 --> 00:37:51,181
Oh yeah he's fine,
it's just,

871
00:37:51,356 --> 00:37:52,531
he has a new girlfriend.

872
00:37:55,316 --> 00:37:57,405
What?

873
00:37:57,579 --> 00:37:58,798
Yeah, he brought her to
Sasha's gala the other night.

874
00:37:58,972 --> 00:38:00,626
It was their
"coming out" event.

875
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,802
Apparently they've been dating
for a few weeks already.

876
00:38:03,368 --> 00:38:06,632
But we only broke
up three weeks ago.

877
00:38:06,806 --> 00:38:09,243
And I'm not even sure our
wedding is fully cancelled yet.

878
00:38:09,417 --> 00:38:10,679
I'm sorry, Charlotte.

879
00:38:10,853 --> 00:38:12,812
Who is she,
do-do-do I know her?

880
00:38:14,379 --> 00:38:15,641
What's her age?

881
00:38:15,815 --> 00:38:18,426
She's your age,
minus 10 years.

882
00:38:21,342 --> 00:38:22,648
Is she pretty?

883
00:38:22,822 --> 00:38:24,302
Only if you like
traditionally pleasing

884
00:38:24,476 --> 00:38:26,391
and symmetrical features,
then yeah.

885
00:38:30,438 --> 00:38:31,613
Oh.

886
00:38:32,788 --> 00:38:34,355
This is awful.

887
00:38:37,706 --> 00:38:40,274
And debuting her at my
best friend's gala?

888
00:38:40,448 --> 00:38:41,406
What was he thinking?

889
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,103
I know, he's not thinking.

890
00:38:43,886 --> 00:38:45,148
No.

891
00:38:45,671 --> 00:38:48,021
No, he's certainly not
thinking about me.

892
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,459
I'm sorry, Charlotte.

893
00:38:51,633 --> 00:38:53,200
I wish I can be
with you right now.

894
00:38:53,374 --> 00:38:55,289
Are you sure you're
gonna be okay?

895
00:38:55,463 --> 00:38:56,943
Yeah, I'll be fine.

896
00:38:59,467 --> 00:39:02,427
I'll just fish
my sorrows away.

897
00:39:03,906 --> 00:39:05,604
I love you,
get some sleep, okay?

898
00:39:05,778 --> 00:39:07,345
I love you too.

899
00:39:13,394 --> 00:39:14,613
Gah!

900
00:39:16,615 --> 00:39:17,790
Grr!

901
00:39:21,794 --> 00:39:23,622
If I may offer
a small note.

902
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,497
Is everything okay?

903
00:39:29,671 --> 00:39:30,977
No, no, everything's
not okay.

904
00:39:32,108 --> 00:39:33,371
Not okay at all.

905
00:39:33,545 --> 00:39:35,024
What's going on?

906
00:39:37,897 --> 00:39:39,464
You wouldn't wanna
hear about it.

907
00:39:41,074 --> 00:39:42,467
What if I do?

908
00:39:49,735 --> 00:39:51,519
It's about my ex-fiancee.

909
00:39:53,565 --> 00:39:55,001
The one you dumped?

910
00:39:58,178 --> 00:39:59,527
How do you know
about that?

911
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,618
I may have read
the Daily article.

912
00:40:03,792 --> 00:40:06,752
Yeah, that one.

913
00:40:08,841 --> 00:40:10,669
Well, he's got a
new girlfriend.

914
00:40:12,105 --> 00:40:13,628
Oh.

915
00:40:13,802 --> 00:40:15,064
And he went public with her

916
00:40:15,238 --> 00:40:17,719
at my best friend's
charity event.

917
00:40:18,764 --> 00:40:19,939
I see.

918
00:40:21,506 --> 00:40:23,986
Well, I mean, you don't wanna
be with a guy like that anyway,

919
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,553
right?

920
00:40:28,034 --> 00:40:28,904
No.

921
00:40:29,078 --> 00:40:30,428
No, you're right, I-

922
00:40:32,821 --> 00:40:34,736
I just wish he hadn't
been so hurtful.

923
00:40:36,695 --> 00:40:38,697
Yeah, I know what you mean.

924
00:40:40,786 --> 00:40:42,570
Yeah, I know you do.

925
00:40:45,007 --> 00:40:46,226
I'm sorry.

926
00:40:46,792 --> 00:40:48,271
Is there
anything I can do?

927
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,882
Do you want me to beat
him up or anything?

928
00:40:50,056 --> 00:40:51,797
I can do that if you need.

929
00:40:51,971 --> 00:40:53,407
I'll beat the
heck out of him.

930
00:40:53,581 --> 00:40:55,235
No, it's okay.

931
00:40:56,802 --> 00:40:58,238
Thank you for listening.

932
00:40:59,544 --> 00:41:00,675
Yeah, of course.

933
00:41:01,633 --> 00:41:03,591
That's what friends
are for, right?

934
00:41:05,811 --> 00:41:06,986
Yeah.

935
00:41:10,032 --> 00:41:12,905
There's also
something else.

936
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:14,602
What is it?

937
00:41:14,776 --> 00:41:17,039
My publisher wants me
to go back to Chicago

938
00:41:17,213 --> 00:41:19,868
just-just for the weekend
to discuss the book.

939
00:41:20,042 --> 00:41:22,436
I tried to get out of
it but she insisted.

940
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:24,090
Is everything okay?

941
00:41:24,264 --> 00:41:25,874
Oh, yeah, no,
she loves the pages.

942
00:41:26,048 --> 00:41:27,354
She just wants to
talk about marketing.

943
00:41:27,528 --> 00:41:28,921
Oh, it's great.

944
00:41:30,226 --> 00:41:31,619
Yeah.

945
00:41:33,055 --> 00:41:34,622
Do you wanna
come with me?

946
00:41:35,623 --> 00:41:37,016
To Chicago?

947
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,626
Yeah, maybe you
could see your dad

948
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,062
and we can get Mike
and Tina to join us.

949
00:41:40,236 --> 00:41:42,848
We can have a little fun,
a nice meal.

950
00:41:43,022 --> 00:41:44,458
I just wanna
thank you guys

951
00:41:44,632 --> 00:41:46,025
for taking such
good care of me

952
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:48,636
and making me
feel included.

953
00:41:50,246 --> 00:41:52,074
Isn't leaving the
wilderness against the rules

954
00:41:52,248 --> 00:41:53,293
for your little project?

955
00:41:53,467 --> 00:41:54,424
I won't tell if you won't.

956
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:56,601
Hey, I ain't no snitch.

957
00:41:57,732 --> 00:41:59,429
Yeah, you're probably right.

958
00:41:59,604 --> 00:42:00,909
Mike and Tina
could use a break

959
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:02,650
and I am due to
check in on my dad.

960
00:42:04,652 --> 00:42:06,045
So we're settled then?

961
00:42:15,881 --> 00:42:17,012
Wow.

962
00:42:17,665 --> 00:42:18,840
You live here?

963
00:42:19,885 --> 00:42:21,626
It's like a museum.

964
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:24,063
Where's all your stuff?

965
00:42:24,237 --> 00:42:25,804
It's called minimalism, Mike,

966
00:42:25,978 --> 00:42:27,632
it's meant to look empty.

967
00:42:28,284 --> 00:42:29,547
Why don't you guys
bring your things upstairs

968
00:42:29,721 --> 00:42:31,157
to the guest bedroom.

969
00:42:31,331 --> 00:42:32,375
I have a very
busy day for you,

970
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,160
full of relaxing.

971
00:42:35,683 --> 00:42:37,076
And I made a reservation

972
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:38,817
at my favorite restaurant,
The French.

973
00:42:39,731 --> 00:42:40,993
Sounds fancy.

974
00:42:42,647 --> 00:42:44,562
I didn't bring
a fancy outfit.

975
00:42:44,736 --> 00:42:46,868
I actually don't
own a fancy outfit.

976
00:42:47,042 --> 00:42:48,696
Yeah, I'm not sure I have
the right clothes either.

977
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:51,525
No worries,
I anticipated this.

978
00:42:56,356 --> 00:42:58,445
before I hit the wall

979
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:00,795
when it's so right for

980
00:43:00,969 --> 00:43:03,015
been and I know what I got

981
00:43:03,189 --> 00:43:05,495
place where to win inside

982
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:07,672
been and I know what I got

983
00:43:07,846 --> 00:43:09,848
place where to win inside

984
00:43:10,022 --> 00:43:11,632
the knife falls steel

985
00:43:11,806 --> 00:43:13,199
starts to shine

986
00:43:13,373 --> 00:43:14,592
you feel change

987
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:17,943
the Wild West coast

988
00:43:18,117 --> 00:43:19,684
so relaxing

989
00:43:19,858 --> 00:43:21,163
off a new line

990
00:43:21,337 --> 00:43:22,687
as I'll go

991
00:43:22,861 --> 00:43:24,253
until I do shine

992
00:43:24,427 --> 00:43:26,212
back the love

993
00:43:26,386 --> 00:43:28,170
and the heat rise above

994
00:43:28,344 --> 00:43:30,477
been and I know what I got

995
00:43:30,651 --> 00:43:32,740
place where to win inside

996
00:43:32,914 --> 00:43:35,090
been and I know what I got

997
00:43:35,264 --> 00:43:37,527
place where to win inside

998
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:53,108
before I hit the wall

999
00:43:53,282 --> 00:43:55,676
when it's so right for

1000
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:06,687
Oh wow, Charlotte,

1001
00:44:06,861 --> 00:44:08,689
what a day,
thank you.

1002
00:44:08,994 --> 00:44:10,691
And that massage,

1003
00:44:10,865 --> 00:44:12,737
it was more relaxing
than a midnight row

1004
00:44:12,911 --> 00:44:14,303
down the Minnesota River.

1005
00:44:15,783 --> 00:44:17,263
I can't believe how
stressed I was.

1006
00:44:17,437 --> 00:44:19,613
Well, you all deserve it,
you work so hard.

1007
00:44:19,787 --> 00:44:22,007
Thanks Charlotte,
you're so sweet.

1008
00:44:22,181 --> 00:44:25,663
Well I have to go
meet my publisher.

1009
00:44:25,837 --> 00:44:27,186
Are you guys okay on your
own for a little bit?

1010
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,710
Yeah, I think I'll
go see my dad.

1011
00:44:29,884 --> 00:44:31,233
I'm gonna go
hit your pool

1012
00:44:31,407 --> 00:44:32,974
because I can't
believe you have one.

1013
00:44:33,714 --> 00:44:35,585
And I'm going
to have a nap

1014
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,676
and try on that
pink dress.

1015
00:44:40,025 --> 00:44:41,156
Ooh.
-Oh.

1016
00:44:42,114 --> 00:44:44,029
Yes, take all the pictures.

1017
00:44:46,379 --> 00:44:47,336
Great, I'll meet you
back here at seven p.m.

1018
00:44:48,816 --> 00:44:49,774
Bye.

1019
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:04,353
I love it.

1020
00:45:04,527 --> 00:45:05,746
I think we have a
hit on our hands.

1021
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,313
Really?
-Oh, that's great news.

1022
00:45:08,314 --> 00:45:11,099
Oh, um, here are some photos.

1023
00:45:11,273 --> 00:45:13,101
I-I think it'd be fun
to include these.

1024
00:45:13,275 --> 00:45:14,842
Just disregard the
ones from today.

1025
00:45:15,756 --> 00:45:16,888
Oh!

1026
00:45:17,062 --> 00:45:18,193
Who's this?

1027
00:45:18,367 --> 00:45:19,281
Jane like.

1028
00:45:19,455 --> 00:45:21,066
That's Rob, my guide.

1029
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:21,893
Not much about
him in the book.

1030
00:45:22,067 --> 00:45:23,372
What's his story?

1031
00:45:23,546 --> 00:45:24,722
He's just very private.

1032
00:45:24,896 --> 00:45:26,811
He went through a
breakup recently.

1033
00:45:26,985 --> 00:45:28,551
He was engaged actually.

1034
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,510
Really?

1035
00:45:30,684 --> 00:45:32,294
Yeah, yeah,
she broke it off.

1036
00:45:32,468 --> 00:45:34,949
Weirdly, she's a financial
broker in New York now.

1037
00:45:35,123 --> 00:45:36,690
But like I said,
he is very private

1038
00:45:36,864 --> 00:45:38,344
and does not wanna
be in the book.

1039
00:45:38,518 --> 00:45:40,738
Sure, okay, well, uh,
send me these pics, okay?

1040
00:45:40,912 --> 00:45:41,695
I wanna get them
to marketing.

1041
00:45:41,869 --> 00:45:43,436
Sure thing.

1042
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:44,959
Ooh, and your agent
wants to read a few pages,

1043
00:45:45,133 --> 00:45:45,743
get those networks
interested again.

1044
00:45:45,917 --> 00:45:46,439
Absolutely.

1045
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:49,877
Yes!

1046
00:45:50,878 --> 00:45:53,576
I can't believe you let her
style your hair like that.

1047
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:54,839
You clean up well.

1048
00:45:55,883 --> 00:45:57,058
You like this girl.

1049
00:45:57,842 --> 00:45:58,930
No, I don't, no.

1050
00:45:59,104 --> 00:46:00,192
Don't lie to me, son.

1051
00:46:00,366 --> 00:46:01,193
I'm not lying.

1052
00:46:01,367 --> 00:46:02,629
We're just-

1053
00:46:02,803 --> 00:46:03,891
We're just friends,
that's all.

1054
00:46:04,065 --> 00:46:05,371
Friends?
- Yeah.

1055
00:46:06,894 --> 00:46:08,287
Just go for it.

1056
00:46:08,896 --> 00:46:10,724
A little help here?

1057
00:46:10,898 --> 00:46:11,812
I'm with him.

1058
00:46:11,986 --> 00:46:13,292
You look happy.

1059
00:46:13,466 --> 00:46:15,250
I say go for it.

1060
00:46:15,424 --> 00:46:16,730
You can't stay walled
up forever, Rob.

1061
00:46:16,904 --> 00:46:17,818
Open up,

1062
00:46:17,992 --> 00:46:19,428
stop being so stubborn.

1063
00:46:19,602 --> 00:46:21,126
Hey, I got a suit,
that's a start, isn't it?

1064
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,388
A suit?

1065
00:46:22,562 --> 00:46:24,346
What do you need that for?

1066
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,870
Ah, we're going to some place
called The French tonight.

1067
00:46:26,348 --> 00:46:28,307
The French, oooh.

1068
00:46:30,396 --> 00:46:33,225
You guys look phenomenal.

1069
00:46:34,182 --> 00:46:35,749
You're our stylist.

1070
00:46:35,923 --> 00:46:37,098
So do you.

1071
00:46:37,533 --> 00:46:39,100
I feel a little exposed, but-

1072
00:46:39,274 --> 00:46:40,580
when in Chicago, right?

1073
00:46:40,754 --> 00:46:41,929
You look beautiful.

1074
00:46:43,322 --> 00:46:44,802
Well, shall we?

1075
00:46:44,976 --> 00:46:45,846
Yes.

1076
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:48,893
Let me just fix this.

1077
00:46:52,984 --> 00:46:54,333
There you go.
-Thank you.

1078
00:46:56,378 --> 00:46:57,945
Whoa, I'll get that.

1079
00:46:58,119 --> 00:46:59,512
Oh, thank you.

1080
00:47:01,296 --> 00:47:03,255
And I'll have the steak,
thank you.

1081
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:07,650
I think that, um,

1082
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:08,738
Mike and I are gonna go up
front of the restaurant

1083
00:47:08,913 --> 00:47:10,305
and take some photos.

1084
00:47:10,479 --> 00:47:11,872
The flowers are
so beautiful.

1085
00:47:12,438 --> 00:47:14,222
We have flowers
at home, sweetie.

1086
00:47:14,396 --> 00:47:15,963
Not like this we don't.

1087
00:47:16,921 --> 00:47:18,313
See you soon .

1088
00:47:19,445 --> 00:47:20,315
Hurry back now.

1089
00:47:20,489 --> 00:47:21,795
We will.

1090
00:47:21,969 --> 00:47:23,144
Come on, sweetie

1091
00:47:24,972 --> 00:47:26,191
And then there were two.

1092
00:47:26,495 --> 00:47:27,888
Indeed there were.

1093
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,064
How's your dad?

1094
00:47:30,238 --> 00:47:31,936
Well he's stubborn as ever
but I think he's doing better.

1095
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:33,024
Good.
-Yeah.

1096
00:47:33,198 --> 00:47:34,329
How was your meeting?

1097
00:47:34,503 --> 00:47:35,940
Oh, it was great.
- Yeah?

1098
00:47:36,941 --> 00:47:38,507
I can't tell yet

1099
00:47:38,681 --> 00:47:40,770
but I think they wanna
turn it into a TV show.

1100
00:47:40,945 --> 00:47:41,902
Charlotte?

1101
00:47:43,208 --> 00:47:44,383
Hey!

1102
00:47:45,036 --> 00:47:47,342
I didn't expect
to see you here.

1103
00:47:47,516 --> 00:47:49,344
I thought you moved
out to the boonies.

1104
00:47:49,518 --> 00:47:50,824
Doug.

1105
00:47:50,998 --> 00:47:51,825
What a surprise.

1106
00:47:51,999 --> 00:47:54,219
Hi, I'm Lara.

1107
00:47:54,393 --> 00:47:55,873
I'm a huge fan
of your books.

1108
00:47:56,047 --> 00:47:57,309
I have been ever
since I was little

1109
00:47:57,483 --> 00:47:59,877
and found one on my
mom's nightstand.

1110
00:48:00,051 --> 00:48:01,008
Thanks.

1111
00:48:02,357 --> 00:48:03,750
And you are?

1112
00:48:03,924 --> 00:48:06,057
Oh I'm Rob,
her boyfriend.

1113
00:48:06,231 --> 00:48:07,406
Oh.

1114
00:48:10,061 --> 00:48:11,453
I didn't realize you
had a boyfriend.

1115
00:48:11,627 --> 00:48:13,020
Well I do.

1116
00:48:13,194 --> 00:48:14,369
This guy.

1117
00:48:16,937 --> 00:48:18,243
So what do you do?

1118
00:48:18,417 --> 00:48:20,201
Well I am a -

1119
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:23,074
A prince.

1120
00:48:26,468 --> 00:48:27,469
I'm-I'm sorry.

1121
00:48:27,643 --> 00:48:28,557
A what?

1122
00:48:28,731 --> 00:48:30,908
A prince, yeah, yeah.

1123
00:48:31,082 --> 00:48:32,213
In, uh, Norway.

1124
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:33,911
Yes.
- Mhm.

1125
00:48:34,085 --> 00:48:35,216
Wow.

1126
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:35,869
So cool.
I know, right?

1127
00:48:36,043 --> 00:48:37,218
Yay.

1128
00:48:39,568 --> 00:48:44,356
Yes, well, um, it was so
nice to see you Doug, Lara.

1129
00:48:45,009 --> 00:48:46,662
Now if you don't mind,

1130
00:48:46,836 --> 00:48:47,489
we have to go speak
to his sister outside.

1131
00:48:47,663 --> 00:48:49,361
The Queen.

1132
00:48:49,535 --> 00:48:50,797
Wouldn't wanna be late
for that would we now.

1133
00:48:50,971 --> 00:48:51,537
Off with their
heads it would be.

1134
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,625
Of course.

1135
00:48:52,799 --> 00:48:54,932
Don't let us keep you.

1136
00:48:55,106 --> 00:48:57,847
It was, uh, really
good to see you.

1137
00:48:58,022 --> 00:48:59,110
You too, Dougie.

1138
00:48:59,284 --> 00:49:00,894
Hey, it's Doug.

1139
00:49:01,068 --> 00:49:02,200
Sure.

1140
00:49:02,374 --> 00:49:03,462
It was so nice
meeting you.

1141
00:49:03,636 --> 00:49:04,985
Let's get
together sometime.

1142
00:49:05,159 --> 00:49:06,552
Sure thing, Lara.

1143
00:49:07,074 --> 00:49:08,032
Go.

1144
00:49:14,125 --> 00:49:15,300
Thank you.

1145
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:19,913
Oh my god!

1146
00:49:20,087 --> 00:49:21,959
A prince, did you see
the look on his face?

1147
00:49:22,133 --> 00:49:23,917
Was it over the top?
I kinda panicked.

1148
00:49:24,091 --> 00:49:25,397
No, no.
- Okay.

1149
00:49:25,571 --> 00:49:27,268
No, it was great, thank you.
-Okay.

1150
00:49:27,442 --> 00:49:28,617
You're welcome.

1151
00:49:31,229 --> 00:49:34,101
I've never seen that
mischievous side of you before.

1152
00:49:34,275 --> 00:49:35,450
I like it.

1153
00:49:36,364 --> 00:49:39,019
Yeah well, I'm
loyal to my people.

1154
00:49:39,193 --> 00:49:40,368
I'm your people?

1155
00:49:41,282 --> 00:49:42,675
You know what I mean.

1156
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:48,028
Well these two seem
to be having fun.

1157
00:49:48,202 --> 00:49:49,682
Yeah.

1158
00:49:49,856 --> 00:49:51,597
Tina hasn't gotten on my
case once about dating

1159
00:49:51,771 --> 00:49:53,120
since we've been here.

1160
00:49:56,167 --> 00:49:58,256
I heard about
your engagement.

1161
00:49:58,430 --> 00:49:59,605
I'm sorry.

1162
00:50:00,084 --> 00:50:02,303
Ah, whatever, it's fine.

1163
00:50:03,174 --> 00:50:05,828
No it's not fine,
it's devastating.

1164
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,178
I should know.

1165
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:11,312
Honestly, I-

1166
00:50:12,444 --> 00:50:16,970
I haven't been totally
truthful about that.

1167
00:50:17,144 --> 00:50:18,711
About breaking up
the engagement.

1168
00:50:20,365 --> 00:50:21,801
What do you mean?

1169
00:50:22,106 --> 00:50:26,110
Um, the truth is,

1170
00:50:29,156 --> 00:50:31,158
Doug broke up with me.

1171
00:50:33,595 --> 00:50:35,162
He blindsided me.

1172
00:50:36,772 --> 00:50:40,211
And I've just been pretending
that it's the other way around.

1173
00:50:40,385 --> 00:50:41,560
I'm sorry.

1174
00:50:46,217 --> 00:50:48,175
It's just so humiliating.

1175
00:50:48,349 --> 00:50:50,003
Especially when you're
a public figure.

1176
00:50:50,177 --> 00:50:52,745
I'm supposed to be a
relationship expert.

1177
00:50:54,834 --> 00:50:57,271
It's okay not to be perfect,
you know.

1178
00:50:57,445 --> 00:50:59,404
You're human,
you're not a robot.

1179
00:51:01,145 --> 00:51:02,146
Yeah, I know.

1180
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:06,019
Can I tell you a secret?

1181
00:51:06,193 --> 00:51:07,325
What's that?

1182
00:51:08,543 --> 00:51:10,980
It kind of makes
you more relatable.

1183
00:51:11,155 --> 00:51:12,547
Really?

1184
00:51:12,721 --> 00:51:14,114
Yeah, you can be a
little intimidating.

1185
00:51:14,288 --> 00:51:15,246
So can you!

1186
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:16,551
What?

1187
00:51:17,422 --> 00:51:19,467
You know, Tina's right,

1188
00:51:19,641 --> 00:51:21,948
you should, you know,
get back out there

1189
00:51:22,122 --> 00:51:23,732
and start dating again.

1190
00:51:25,256 --> 00:51:27,171
Stop spending
every night alone.

1191
00:51:28,781 --> 00:51:31,175
Put myself out there
and start dating, huh?

1192
00:51:31,349 --> 00:51:32,480
Yeah.
- Yeah?

1193
00:51:33,481 --> 00:51:35,266
What have you
got to lose?

1194
00:51:38,443 --> 00:51:39,618
Oh.

1195
00:51:40,619 --> 00:51:42,273
They're pouring
our champagne.

1196
00:51:42,447 --> 00:51:43,970
Great.

1197
00:51:44,144 --> 00:51:45,058
We should go, don't wanna
miss the first course.

1198
00:51:45,232 --> 00:51:46,364
Right.

1199
00:51:50,759 --> 00:51:52,109
My lady.
-Thank you.

1200
00:51:52,283 --> 00:51:53,414
And my gentleman.

1201
00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:05,296
Thank you so much
for inviting us

1202
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:07,124
to the city, Charlotte.

1203
00:52:07,298 --> 00:52:09,300
I can't remember the last
time we had so much fun.

1204
00:52:09,474 --> 00:52:11,128
Oh, I'm so glad
you guys came.

1205
00:52:11,302 --> 00:52:14,087
It was nice to show you
my world for a little bit,

1206
00:52:14,261 --> 00:52:16,220
since you were so kind
to show me yours.

1207
00:52:16,611 --> 00:52:18,396
All right,
see you inside.

1208
00:52:22,617 --> 00:52:24,576
I should get
back to my dad.

1209
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:25,707
Flight's at noon tomorrow?

1210
00:52:25,881 --> 00:52:27,231
Yes.

1211
00:52:27,405 --> 00:52:28,536
See you here at 10?
-Sounds good.

1212
00:52:29,537 --> 00:52:32,410
Uh, thank you again for
pretending to be my boyfriend.

1213
00:52:32,584 --> 00:52:33,715
It was really nice of you.

1214
00:52:33,889 --> 00:52:34,716
No problem.

1215
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:36,283
I had fun.

1216
00:52:36,762 --> 00:52:38,155
Good.

1217
00:52:39,417 --> 00:52:40,635
Good night.

1218
00:52:40,809 --> 00:52:42,159
Good night.

1219
00:53:03,267 --> 00:53:05,269
Okay, you guys hungry?

1220
00:53:05,443 --> 00:53:06,618
I could eat.

1221
00:53:07,619 --> 00:53:10,187
Ah, I-I'm sorry,
I should have bought food.

1222
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:12,798
I'm not used to
having guests over.

1223
00:53:12,972 --> 00:53:15,061
It's fine, really, we'll
go explore the neighborhood.

1224
00:53:15,235 --> 00:53:16,671
Yeah, we'll,
uh, do brunch.

1225
00:53:17,846 --> 00:53:19,761
Oh, just one second.

1226
00:53:20,632 --> 00:53:21,937
Hey Mal, what's up?

1227
00:53:22,111 --> 00:53:23,330
I have some exciting news!

1228
00:53:23,504 --> 00:53:25,332
Go on.

1229
00:53:25,506 --> 00:53:27,204
Your publisher slipped a copy of
your pages to a network exec,

1230
00:53:27,378 --> 00:53:28,466
he loved it.

1231
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,424
Are you serious?

1232
00:53:30,598 --> 00:53:32,034
Yeah, he's interested
in a TV show.

1233
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,427
No, the show is back on?

1234
00:53:33,601 --> 00:53:35,429
Yeah well, with a
different spin.

1235
00:53:35,603 --> 00:53:37,039
Anyway, I set up a meeting for
10 a.m. back at The French.

1236
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:38,780
Can you make it?

1237
00:53:38,954 --> 00:53:39,825
Yeah, yeah, it's a
little tight with my flight

1238
00:53:39,999 --> 00:53:41,000
but I'll make it work.

1239
00:53:41,174 --> 00:53:41,740
Okay, great.

1240
00:53:41,914 --> 00:53:42,306
Thank you.

1241
00:53:43,568 --> 00:53:44,699
Good news?

1242
00:53:44,873 --> 00:53:45,744
I think so.

1243
00:53:45,918 --> 00:53:47,049
I have to take a meeting.

1244
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:48,573
Are you guys okay
on your own?

1245
00:53:48,747 --> 00:53:50,227
Of course.
-Get out of here, we'll be fine.

1246
00:53:50,401 --> 00:53:53,317
Okay, um, I will meet
you guys at the airport.

1247
00:53:54,579 --> 00:53:55,667
My keys.

1248
00:53:55,841 --> 00:53:57,016
Don't wait for me.
-Okay.

1249
00:53:57,321 --> 00:53:58,452
Good luck.

1250
00:53:59,453 --> 00:54:00,672
The book sounds brilliant.

1251
00:54:00,846 --> 00:54:02,543
Guaranteed bestseller,

1252
00:54:02,717 --> 00:54:05,242
it'll totally wash away
the stink of that last one.

1253
00:54:05,416 --> 00:54:07,200
Oh, thanks.

1254
00:54:07,374 --> 00:54:09,463
Now let's talk TV.

1255
00:54:09,637 --> 00:54:11,204
Yes, I was thinking a
fun tie-in to the book

1256
00:54:11,378 --> 00:54:13,293
would be a show where I take
people to the wilderness

1257
00:54:13,467 --> 00:54:15,164
and teach them survival
skills that they don't have.

1258
00:54:15,339 --> 00:54:16,992
Forget that.

1259
00:54:17,166 --> 00:54:18,385
Your publisher showed me
those before and after photos

1260
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:20,257
of those lumberjacks.

1261
00:54:20,431 --> 00:54:22,084
From plaid to fab.

1262
00:54:22,433 --> 00:54:24,435
And that chunky woman
in the dress, incredible.

1263
00:54:24,609 --> 00:54:26,524
I think there's a
real show there.

1264
00:54:26,698 --> 00:54:28,308
Are-are you
talking about Tina?

1265
00:54:28,482 --> 00:54:30,702
You travel to those
rural remote areas,

1266
00:54:30,876 --> 00:54:33,313
you find these hopelessly
single men and women

1267
00:54:33,487 --> 00:54:35,228
who have no idea how
to dress themselves,

1268
00:54:35,402 --> 00:54:37,404
no idea how to eat
at a dinner party,

1269
00:54:37,578 --> 00:54:40,146
no culture, no class,
et cetera.

1270
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,626
You get them cleaned up,

1271
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,150
you teach them some
manners and voila!

1272
00:54:44,324 --> 00:54:46,239
You turn them into catches.

1273
00:54:46,413 --> 00:54:47,327
I don't know,

1274
00:54:47,501 --> 00:54:49,416
that kinda sounds mean.

1275
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:51,549
Your publisher mentioned
that guide of yours, Rob,

1276
00:54:51,723 --> 00:54:53,290
I think his name is.

1277
00:54:53,464 --> 00:54:55,204
His fiancee dumped him to
be a banker in New York.

1278
00:54:55,379 --> 00:54:57,163
He should be our
first experiment.

1279
00:54:57,337 --> 00:54:58,773
Like maybe if he knew
how to carry himself,

1280
00:54:58,947 --> 00:54:59,818
he wouldn't have
been dumped, right?

1281
00:54:59,992 --> 00:55:01,559
That's not what happened.

1282
00:55:01,733 --> 00:55:02,995
I'll have my agent
send over the contract.

1283
00:55:03,169 --> 00:55:04,649
I think you'll
like the terms.

1284
00:55:04,823 --> 00:55:06,607
I gotta go, I gotta catch
a flight back to LA.

1285
00:55:06,781 --> 00:55:08,261
I'm really looking forward to
working with you, Charlotte.

1286
00:55:08,435 --> 00:55:09,393
I-

1287
00:55:17,052 --> 00:55:18,271
Charlotte?

1288
00:55:18,445 --> 00:55:19,272
Hi!

1289
00:55:19,446 --> 00:55:20,839
Oh, Sasha!

1290
00:55:21,013 --> 00:55:22,623
It's so nice
to see you.

1291
00:55:23,102 --> 00:55:24,495
Congrats on your
benefit last week.

1292
00:55:24,669 --> 00:55:26,323
You must have raised
so much money.

1293
00:55:26,497 --> 00:55:27,976
Most of it went to
pay the caterers

1294
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:30,152
but we'll give the
charity a nice little sum.

1295
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:31,980
Hey, did you get my email

1296
00:55:32,154 --> 00:55:34,331
with the GoFundMe for
my friends in Minnesota?

1297
00:55:34,505 --> 00:55:35,375
They got robbed and
they can't afford-

1298
00:55:35,549 --> 00:55:36,811
Send it to my assistant.

1299
00:55:36,985 --> 00:55:38,291
I never check my
own emails anymore.

1300
00:55:38,465 --> 00:55:39,901
Oh!

1301
00:55:40,075 --> 00:55:41,860
Well, do you wanna
hear more about it or?

1302
00:55:42,034 --> 00:55:43,427
If it's important to you,
it is important to me.

1303
00:55:43,601 --> 00:55:45,342
I'll make a donation
from my foundation,

1304
00:55:45,516 --> 00:55:46,517
AKA the tax haven.

1305
00:55:46,691 --> 00:55:47,518
Right.

1306
00:55:47,692 --> 00:55:49,258
Oh, I almost forgot.

1307
00:55:49,433 --> 00:55:51,391
I got you a little something.

1308
00:55:51,565 --> 00:55:52,914
Ooh, I love gifts.

1309
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:54,916
Isn't it cute?

1310
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:56,527
I got it in a little
store in Minnesota.

1311
00:55:56,701 --> 00:55:58,964
Aw, how sweet,
it's tiny.

1312
00:56:00,531 --> 00:56:02,141
Oh wait,
this is a joke, right?

1313
00:56:03,534 --> 00:56:05,797
Oh, you're too funny,
Charlotte, this is hysterical.

1314
00:56:05,971 --> 00:56:06,972
No, no, it's not a joke.

1315
00:56:07,146 --> 00:56:08,495
Come back soon, okay?

1316
00:56:08,669 --> 00:56:10,279
I miss you and your
sense of humor.

1317
00:56:10,454 --> 00:56:11,280
Bye.

1318
00:56:11,455 --> 00:56:12,456
Bye.

1319
00:56:20,855 --> 00:56:22,248
The air is so
fresh here.

1320
00:56:22,422 --> 00:56:23,684
I can really
notice it now.

1321
00:56:23,858 --> 00:56:25,991
Ah, it was fun to
be in the city

1322
00:56:26,165 --> 00:56:27,732
but it's good to be back.

1323
00:56:28,863 --> 00:56:31,344
Okay everyone,
quiet please.

1324
00:56:31,518 --> 00:56:32,693
What's this all about?

1325
00:56:32,867 --> 00:56:34,521
I have an
announcement to make.

1326
00:56:35,696 --> 00:56:38,264
Thanks to the generosity
of everyone here,

1327
00:56:38,438 --> 00:56:40,397
and also some people
who aren't here,

1328
00:56:40,571 --> 00:56:42,050
I wanted to announce

1329
00:56:42,224 --> 00:56:45,445
that we have reached
our 30,000 dollar goal

1330
00:56:45,619 --> 00:56:46,838
for the new canoes.

1331
00:56:48,535 --> 00:56:49,449
What?

1332
00:56:49,623 --> 00:56:51,495
You're joking, already?

1333
00:56:51,669 --> 00:56:52,800
And there's more
pouring in by the day.

1334
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:55,499
Well, we'll give the
rest to charity.

1335
00:56:56,587 --> 00:56:57,892
Thanks, Charlotte.

1336
00:56:58,066 --> 00:56:59,590
I don't know how
we'll ever repay you.

1337
00:56:59,764 --> 00:57:01,330
Ah, don't worry about it.

1338
00:57:01,505 --> 00:57:03,420
You've done more for
me than you know.

1339
00:57:06,814 --> 00:57:08,599
That's what friends
are for, right?

1340
00:57:08,773 --> 00:57:10,557
That's what
friends are for.

1341
00:57:14,474 --> 00:57:17,390
You know I don't think
I properly thanked you

1342
00:57:17,564 --> 00:57:19,436
for being my guide.

1343
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:23,396
The whole deal felt a little
transactional at the time.

1344
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:25,354
There is no need
to thank me.

1345
00:57:25,529 --> 00:57:27,356
This book is paying
for my dad's surgery.

1346
00:57:27,531 --> 00:57:29,228
It should be me
thanking you.

1347
00:57:29,402 --> 00:57:31,709
But still, it's taking you
away from your guide duties.

1348
00:57:31,883 --> 00:57:34,581
Believe me, I'm happy to
take a break from those.

1349
00:57:34,755 --> 00:57:35,713
You don't like
being a guide?

1350
00:57:35,887 --> 00:57:37,410
Sometimes.

1351
00:57:37,584 --> 00:57:39,499
But honestly we get a
lot of jerks up here.

1352
00:57:39,673 --> 00:57:40,848
They don't
respect the land,

1353
00:57:41,022 --> 00:57:42,459
they don't respect
the animals.

1354
00:57:42,633 --> 00:57:44,722
They certainly
don't respect us.

1355
00:57:44,896 --> 00:57:47,812
Sometimes I just feel like a
babysitter for rich people.

1356
00:57:50,597 --> 00:57:51,816
I'm sorry.

1357
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:53,121
It's okay.
-I didn't mean you.

1358
00:57:53,295 --> 00:57:54,906
I know, I know,
it's okay.

1359
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:57,343
Honestly, teaching you
one-on-one has been great.

1360
00:57:57,517 --> 00:58:01,478
You're so focused and you're
serious about learning.

1361
00:58:01,652 --> 00:58:03,523
Half the time we
get groups up here,

1362
00:58:03,697 --> 00:58:05,830
they treat it like a joke
or an Instagram opportunity.

1363
00:58:08,006 --> 00:58:11,400
Maybe you could change
the business model.

1364
00:58:11,575 --> 00:58:13,011
Only teach people
one-on-one

1365
00:58:13,185 --> 00:58:14,403
or only teach people
who are really serious

1366
00:58:14,578 --> 00:58:15,970
about this kind of stuff.

1367
00:58:16,667 --> 00:58:18,495
The problem is,

1368
00:58:18,669 --> 00:58:20,409
the groups bring
in all the money.

1369
00:58:20,584 --> 00:58:23,630
I mean I only live simply
here but I gotta eat.

1370
00:58:23,804 --> 00:58:25,632
Yeah, no I-I get it.

1371
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:28,679
Anyways, I'll figure it out.

1372
00:58:28,853 --> 00:58:30,724
Right now I need
to focus on you.

1373
00:58:30,898 --> 00:58:32,770
Only a few more days
until our big excursion.

1374
00:58:32,944 --> 00:58:35,642
Ah, a week in
the wilderness.

1375
00:58:36,556 --> 00:58:37,905
Do you think I'll make it?

1376
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:39,690
I think you're
gonna be fine.

1377
00:58:40,081 --> 00:58:41,430
Plus Tina and Mike
will be there

1378
00:58:41,605 --> 00:58:43,302
to make sure we
don't screw up, so.

1379
00:58:45,304 --> 00:58:46,610
So what else do
I need to learn?

1380
00:58:46,784 --> 00:58:49,787
When starting a fire,
take your stick,

1381
00:58:49,961 --> 00:58:52,616
place it on the
dry wood here.

1382
00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:53,704
Here you go,
like so.

1383
00:58:53,878 --> 00:58:55,314
All the way down.

1384
00:58:56,228 --> 00:58:57,534
Okay, let me try.

1385
00:59:04,279 --> 00:59:05,106
Ooh.
-There you go.

1386
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,107
It's hard.

1387
00:59:06,281 --> 00:59:07,718
I know.

1388
00:59:08,109 --> 00:59:09,720
This is hard,
it burns my hand.

1389
00:59:09,894 --> 00:59:11,722
Luckily I've got these.

1390
00:59:11,896 --> 00:59:13,071
Okay.

1391
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:22,515
There you go.
-It's working.

1392
00:59:22,689 --> 00:59:23,647
You started your first fire.

1393
00:59:23,821 --> 00:59:24,952
Yay!

1394
00:59:29,217 --> 00:59:30,610
Go.

1395
00:59:44,711 --> 00:59:45,669
Oh!

1396
00:59:47,192 --> 00:59:48,759
That is unfair!

1397
00:59:50,717 --> 00:59:52,893
Oh come on, come on!

1398
00:59:56,157 --> 00:59:57,898
You ready for this,
you ready for this?

1399
00:59:58,072 --> 00:59:59,291
Ah, yes!

1400
00:59:59,465 --> 01:00:00,988
No, it doesn't count.

1401
01:00:01,162 --> 01:00:02,468
You're disqualified.
-I am the champion!

1402
01:00:02,642 --> 01:00:03,861
You can't push your
opponents over.

1403
01:00:12,652 --> 01:00:13,653
Show me your moves.

1404
01:00:13,827 --> 01:00:15,046
Come on!

1405
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:27,188
Will you dance with me?

1406
01:00:27,362 --> 01:00:28,886
I don't know,

1407
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:31,149
I think Mike needs my
help behind the bar.

1408
01:00:31,323 --> 01:00:32,585
I'm fine.

1409
01:00:32,759 --> 01:00:33,934
No excuses.

1410
01:00:34,935 --> 01:00:36,110
Come on.

1411
01:00:37,721 --> 01:00:38,809
Okay.

1412
01:00:38,983 --> 01:00:40,419
You old man.

1413
01:00:42,813 --> 01:00:44,423
Come on, show me
your dance moves.

1414
01:00:45,729 --> 01:00:46,730
Yeah?

1415
01:00:49,994 --> 01:00:51,430
Is that good?

1416
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:55,260
Oh.

1417
01:00:55,434 --> 01:00:57,044
Oh we don't have to.

1418
01:00:57,218 --> 01:00:59,438
No, come on,
let's dance.

1419
01:01:05,183 --> 01:01:06,793
Look at these
two over here.

1420
01:01:07,838 --> 01:01:10,754
I can't believe this whole
thing is almost over.

1421
01:01:11,929 --> 01:01:13,365
Yeah.

1422
01:01:13,539 --> 01:01:14,975
You must be looking
forward to getting back.

1423
01:01:16,716 --> 01:01:17,978
Yeah.

1424
01:01:18,936 --> 01:01:21,286
Guess I'm excited
to go back.

1425
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:25,725
I'll miss you
around here.

1426
01:01:30,208 --> 01:01:31,992
I'll miss you guys too.

1427
01:01:32,906 --> 01:01:34,952
And this beautiful place.

1428
01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:39,608
I know Tina
really likes you.

1429
01:01:39,783 --> 01:01:41,001
She's, um-

1430
01:01:41,872 --> 01:01:43,787
She's really enjoyed
having you around.

1431
01:01:47,268 --> 01:01:48,705
I like Tina too.

1432
01:02:10,030 --> 01:02:12,076
are dirty some

1433
01:02:17,081 --> 01:02:18,299
Well I-
-Yeah.

1434
01:02:18,473 --> 01:02:20,040
Better get back to, uh-
-Same.

1435
01:02:23,827 --> 01:02:25,829
Okay.

1436
01:02:35,926 --> 01:02:37,101
Tina.

1437
01:02:39,494 --> 01:02:40,887
What's up?

1438
01:02:41,845 --> 01:02:43,237
What are you doing?

1439
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:45,631
What do you mean?

1440
01:02:45,805 --> 01:02:46,719
You like her.

1441
01:02:46,893 --> 01:02:48,025
Who?

1442
01:02:48,199 --> 01:02:50,070
And you may
even love her.

1443
01:02:50,244 --> 01:02:52,638
Hey, will you keep
your voice down?

1444
01:02:52,812 --> 01:02:54,379
What are you gonna
do about it?

1445
01:02:55,554 --> 01:02:56,990
It's complicated, Tina.

1446
01:02:57,164 --> 01:02:59,384
She lives in Chicago
for crying out loud.

1447
01:02:59,558 --> 01:03:02,909
I haven't seen you this
happy in a long time.

1448
01:03:03,083 --> 01:03:04,737
And Charlotte's
a good woman.

1449
01:03:04,911 --> 01:03:06,173
I know that.

1450
01:03:06,347 --> 01:03:08,001
But it doesn't
change the facts.

1451
01:03:08,175 --> 01:03:11,962
You have been making
excuses time and time again.

1452
01:03:12,136 --> 01:03:14,747
Look, I know
you've been hurt.

1453
01:03:14,921 --> 01:03:17,228
And I know it's
been hard.

1454
01:03:17,402 --> 01:03:20,100
But are you really gonna
let a good woman go

1455
01:03:20,274 --> 01:03:22,668
because your heart has
been hardened by a person

1456
01:03:22,842 --> 01:03:25,802
who didn't deserve it
in the first place?

1457
01:03:27,107 --> 01:03:29,066
She leaves in a week.

1458
01:03:30,545 --> 01:03:33,810
And since Mike and I
are going on this trip,

1459
01:03:33,984 --> 01:03:37,117
you really only have
tomorrow left with her.

1460
01:03:37,291 --> 01:03:38,466
So.

1461
01:03:41,078 --> 01:03:42,601
What you gonna do?

1462
01:03:49,913 --> 01:03:51,088
Oh boy.

1463
01:04:11,282 --> 01:04:12,109
Hi.

1464
01:04:12,283 --> 01:04:13,458
Hi.

1465
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:15,852
You're up early.

1466
01:04:16,026 --> 01:04:17,636
I'm just enjoying the view.

1467
01:04:18,506 --> 01:04:21,161
I was trying to get
some work done but

1468
01:04:21,335 --> 01:04:24,295
I can't stop looking
at this beauty.

1469
01:04:26,036 --> 01:04:29,039
I can't believe you wake
up to this every day.

1470
01:04:29,213 --> 01:04:32,303
Yeah, and it never
gets old either.

1471
01:04:35,436 --> 01:04:36,698
I didn't think I
was gonna see you

1472
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:38,352
until later today.

1473
01:04:41,486 --> 01:04:43,488
Uh, you're not,
really, um-

1474
01:04:45,098 --> 01:04:48,972
I just came by to see what
you were doing tonight.

1475
01:04:51,278 --> 01:04:54,020
What we do every night,
go to the watering hole.

1476
01:04:55,979 --> 01:04:58,155
What if we did something
a little different?

1477
01:05:00,157 --> 01:05:01,810
Sure, what are you thinking?

1478
01:05:01,985 --> 01:05:03,160
Well, um...

1479
01:05:05,031 --> 01:05:07,251
It's a surprise.

1480
01:05:07,425 --> 01:05:08,687
Ooh.

1481
01:05:09,470 --> 01:05:10,819
Meet me at the lake,

1482
01:05:10,994 --> 01:05:12,821
at the drop in point, sunset.

1483
01:05:12,996 --> 01:05:14,301
What are we doing?

1484
01:05:14,475 --> 01:05:16,042
I just said,
it's a surprise.

1485
01:05:16,216 --> 01:05:17,609
Oh, okay, okay.

1486
01:05:18,958 --> 01:05:20,612
I will see you then.

1487
01:05:22,614 --> 01:05:24,181
Good, good, okay.

1488
01:05:25,573 --> 01:05:26,879
I'll-I'll let you get
back to your work.

1489
01:05:27,053 --> 01:05:28,228
Oh, yes.

1490
01:05:29,012 --> 01:05:29,882
Very important.

1491
01:05:30,056 --> 01:05:31,231
Yeah.

1492
01:05:32,189 --> 01:05:34,191
All right, uh,
see you later.

1493
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:48,466
What's all this?

1494
01:05:48,814 --> 01:05:52,296
Oh, um, just thought we
could enjoy the sunset.

1495
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,255
Just the two of us?

1496
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:57,736
If that's okay.

1497
01:05:58,737 --> 01:06:00,173
Yeah, that's lovely.

1498
01:06:00,347 --> 01:06:01,566
Okay.

1499
01:06:02,349 --> 01:06:04,221
Um, right this way.

1500
01:06:05,091 --> 01:06:06,049
Okay.

1501
01:06:07,485 --> 01:06:08,747
Wow.

1502
01:06:10,183 --> 01:06:12,142
Oh, thank you.

1503
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:16,929
You good?

1504
01:06:17,103 --> 01:06:18,061
Okay.

1505
01:06:19,018 --> 01:06:20,237
Ready?
-Yeah.

1506
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:41,432
So what's the occasion?

1507
01:06:43,216 --> 01:06:44,435
Oh, um...

1508
01:06:45,305 --> 01:06:46,785
Well it's our-

1509
01:06:46,959 --> 01:06:48,482
it's our last night in
civilization for a while

1510
01:06:48,656 --> 01:06:52,182
so I just thought we
could make it special.

1511
01:06:54,706 --> 01:06:56,969
That's very sweet,
thank you.

1512
01:06:58,188 --> 01:06:59,102
Sure.

1513
01:07:10,504 --> 01:07:11,723
Are you okay?

1514
01:07:13,246 --> 01:07:14,378
Yeah.

1515
01:07:14,552 --> 01:07:15,509
Yeah, yeah,
I'm totally fine.

1516
01:07:15,683 --> 01:07:16,423
Okay.
- Yeah.

1517
01:07:16,597 --> 01:07:17,816
Okay good.

1518
01:07:21,124 --> 01:07:24,127
Well the truth is, um-

1519
01:07:26,651 --> 01:07:28,044
Yes?

1520
01:07:29,306 --> 01:07:32,222
Well, what I
wanted to say was-

1521
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:37,053
Go on.

1522
01:07:41,796 --> 01:07:43,189
I like you.

1523
01:07:44,408 --> 01:07:46,366
And I have for a while.

1524
01:07:47,411 --> 01:07:49,761
I know I misjudged
you and I'm so sorry.

1525
01:07:51,371 --> 01:07:53,112
Here I thought you
were this prissy,

1526
01:07:53,286 --> 01:07:54,505
stuck-up,
materialistic, rich-

1527
01:07:54,679 --> 01:07:57,029
Okay, I-I get it Rob,
thank you.

1528
01:07:57,203 --> 01:07:58,378
But...

1529
01:08:00,859 --> 01:08:03,731
You turned out to
be the most kind,

1530
01:08:05,211 --> 01:08:06,647
thoughtful,

1531
01:08:06,821 --> 01:08:09,259
well-meaning woman
I've ever met.

1532
01:08:10,869 --> 01:08:14,960
I know you live in Chicago
and I, I live out here, but,

1533
01:08:15,134 --> 01:08:16,962
I just couldn't
let you leave here

1534
01:08:17,136 --> 01:08:21,053
without telling you
how I felt because

1535
01:08:21,227 --> 01:08:23,055
if I did then I would
have regretted it

1536
01:08:23,229 --> 01:08:25,188
for the rest of my life.

1537
01:08:31,672 --> 01:08:32,760
Did I blow it?

1538
01:08:32,934 --> 01:08:34,371
I-I said too much,
didn't I,

1539
01:08:34,545 --> 01:08:35,807
I'm so sorry.
-No, no, no.

1540
01:08:35,981 --> 01:08:36,590
Hey, hey, hey.
-If you don't feel it's-

1541
01:08:40,725 --> 01:08:42,335
I like you too.

1542
01:08:47,340 --> 01:08:51,475
on a crooked line

1543
01:08:51,649 --> 01:08:53,651
space and time

1544
01:08:53,825 --> 01:08:59,135
I've been thinking of

1545
01:08:59,309 --> 01:09:03,139
are hit and miss

1546
01:09:03,313 --> 01:09:05,619
can't be fixed

1547
01:09:05,793 --> 01:09:11,147
I've been thinking of

1548
01:09:14,411 --> 01:09:17,457
The picnic was lovely,
thank you.

1549
01:09:17,631 --> 01:09:19,807
Well, Tina helped
me plan it.

1550
01:09:22,201 --> 01:09:23,594
Tina's a good friend.

1551
01:09:24,290 --> 01:09:25,770
Don't I know it.

1552
01:09:29,295 --> 01:09:30,949
I should probably go in.

1553
01:09:32,516 --> 01:09:34,692
Yeah, yeah.

1554
01:09:34,866 --> 01:09:39,436
Um, I'll see you tomorrow,
bright and early.

1555
01:09:40,350 --> 01:09:41,786
Bright and early.

1556
01:09:43,918 --> 01:09:45,355
Good night.

1557
01:09:46,617 --> 01:09:50,142
been thinking of

1558
01:09:50,316 --> 01:09:54,407
of the world and

1559
01:09:54,581 --> 01:09:58,324
my love

1560
01:10:01,849 --> 01:10:08,726
like the evening sun

1561
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:14,775
like the stars in broken ones

1562
01:10:45,415 --> 01:10:46,720
Charlotte, I know what
you're gonna say.

1563
01:10:46,894 --> 01:10:48,069
I just got a pitch
from the network.

1564
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:49,854
What is this?
It's horrible!

1565
01:10:50,028 --> 01:10:51,812
I know, I got the
same email too.

1566
01:10:51,986 --> 01:10:53,510
It's disgusting.

1567
01:10:53,684 --> 01:10:55,860
Where did they even
get that information?

1568
01:10:56,034 --> 01:10:57,644
I asked Jane to send over
a synopsis of the whole book.

1569
01:10:57,818 --> 01:10:59,864
She must have editorialized
on your notes.

1570
01:11:00,038 --> 01:11:01,431
Well this is awful
and offensive.

1571
01:11:01,605 --> 01:11:03,259
I would never say
these things.

1572
01:11:03,433 --> 01:11:04,564
Mal, these people
are my friends

1573
01:11:04,738 --> 01:11:06,305
and-and Rob is...

1574
01:11:07,872 --> 01:11:09,221
Rob is my friend too.

1575
01:11:09,395 --> 01:11:10,831
I'm not doing this show.

1576
01:11:11,005 --> 01:11:12,529
Yeah, of course not.

1577
01:11:12,703 --> 01:11:14,313
I will shut it down ASAP,
tell them you're out.

1578
01:11:14,487 --> 01:11:16,141
I prefer your
version anyway.

1579
01:11:16,315 --> 01:11:17,273
Thanks, Mal.

1580
01:11:17,447 --> 01:11:19,275
Of course.

1581
01:11:19,449 --> 01:11:20,711
Get some sleep and don't
worry about this at all, okay?

1582
01:11:20,885 --> 01:11:22,234
You got a big trip
in the morning.

1583
01:11:22,408 --> 01:11:23,453
You need to rest.

1584
01:11:23,627 --> 01:11:24,802
I will

1585
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:27,500
I can't wait to see you.

1586
01:11:27,674 --> 01:11:30,155
I have so much
to tell you.

1587
01:11:30,329 --> 01:11:31,461
Me too.

1588
01:11:31,635 --> 01:11:32,200
Good night.

1589
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:33,376
Night.

1590
01:11:36,466 --> 01:11:38,076
What is wrong with
these people?

1591
01:11:49,087 --> 01:11:51,872
Ooh, something
smells amazing in here.

1592
01:11:52,046 --> 01:11:53,396
Good morning.

1593
01:11:56,007 --> 01:11:57,443
What?

1594
01:11:58,401 --> 01:12:00,664
Well look who finally
decided to start cooking.

1595
01:12:00,838 --> 01:12:03,231
Well, I woke up early this
morning to work on my book,

1596
01:12:03,406 --> 01:12:04,972
and I was hungry,

1597
01:12:05,146 --> 01:12:06,670
so I thought I'd make you
guys a little something.

1598
01:12:07,497 --> 01:12:09,455
I actually forgot how
fun it is to cook.

1599
01:12:09,629 --> 01:12:11,805
Anyway, eat up,
I will finish packing.

1600
01:12:11,979 --> 01:12:13,372
Thank you.

1601
01:12:13,851 --> 01:12:15,287
I am starving.

1602
01:12:15,461 --> 01:12:16,636
Look at this!

1603
01:12:17,507 --> 01:12:18,682
What's this?

1604
01:12:19,509 --> 01:12:21,162
Is that me?

1605
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:23,991
Oh, this must be for the book,
this is so exciting!

1606
01:12:27,386 --> 01:12:28,605
Overweight and mannish?

1607
01:12:32,565 --> 01:12:33,523
What?

1608
01:12:33,697 --> 01:12:34,872
What is that?

1609
01:12:36,917 --> 01:12:38,571
College dropout.

1610
01:12:38,745 --> 01:12:41,139
Can't afford the canoes
for his own business?

1611
01:12:42,401 --> 01:12:43,663
I don't understand,

1612
01:12:43,837 --> 01:12:44,925
I thought she
wanted to help us.

1613
01:12:45,099 --> 01:12:46,536
What are you
guys looking at?

1614
01:12:46,710 --> 01:12:48,451
It's a contract for
the show she's pitching.

1615
01:12:49,756 --> 01:12:51,845
Looks like you're
the pilot episode.

1616
01:12:52,019 --> 01:12:53,412
What?

1617
01:12:53,934 --> 01:12:55,501
Uneducated Lumberjack?

1618
01:12:56,502 --> 01:12:57,721
Are you kidding me?

1619
01:12:58,765 --> 01:13:01,681
Fiancé left him because he
wasn't successful enough.

1620
01:13:03,117 --> 01:13:04,336
Is this what she
actually thinks of us?

1621
01:13:04,510 --> 01:13:05,555
Looks like she's
been using us

1622
01:13:05,729 --> 01:13:07,731
to pitch a show
this whole time.

1623
01:13:07,905 --> 01:13:09,080
I gotta go.

1624
01:13:09,950 --> 01:13:11,517
Ah, Tina, wait.

1625
01:13:14,694 --> 01:13:16,217
Alrighty friends,

1626
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:18,481
who's ready for a
little surviving?

1627
01:13:18,655 --> 01:13:19,960
Where's Mike and Tina?

1628
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:23,573
What's wrong?

1629
01:13:25,575 --> 01:13:26,793
Oh my god,

1630
01:13:26,967 --> 01:13:28,186
that's not what
it looks like.

1631
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:29,535
I can't believe
I fell for it.

1632
01:13:29,709 --> 01:13:30,362
Rob, no, you-you
don't understand.

1633
01:13:30,536 --> 01:13:32,146
That's not-

1634
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,235
You were just using us this
whole time, weren't you?

1635
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:35,672
No, I wasn't.

1636
01:13:35,846 --> 01:13:37,587
Rob, please,
just let me explain.

1637
01:13:37,761 --> 01:13:39,371
And here I thought
what we had was real.

1638
01:13:39,545 --> 01:13:41,286
It was, it-it is!

1639
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:43,854
I was just a project for you,
wasn't I?

1640
01:13:44,028 --> 01:13:45,421
Just a commodity
for you to sell

1641
01:13:45,595 --> 01:13:47,074
like everything
else in your life.

1642
01:13:47,248 --> 01:13:48,728
'Cause that's the world
you live in, right?

1643
01:13:48,902 --> 01:13:50,469
Everything's for sale,
everything's disposable.

1644
01:13:50,643 --> 01:13:51,949
I didn't
write that, Rob.

1645
01:13:52,123 --> 01:13:53,516
You're not a
project to me.

1646
01:13:53,690 --> 01:13:56,040
I guess you are
just a superficial,

1647
01:13:56,214 --> 01:13:59,391
fame-hungry
perfectionist after all.

1648
01:13:59,565 --> 01:14:00,523
Wow.

1649
01:14:02,612 --> 01:14:03,961
You are a terrible listener.
- Oh yeah?

1650
01:14:04,135 --> 01:14:05,658
And you know what,

1651
01:14:05,832 --> 01:14:07,617
at least I can say one
true thing in this world,

1652
01:14:07,791 --> 01:14:09,880
unlike you who can't
even say you like me

1653
01:14:10,054 --> 01:14:11,925
without having
a heart attack.

1654
01:14:12,099 --> 01:14:13,927
Well don't worry because
I don't like you anymore.

1655
01:14:14,101 --> 01:14:14,972
Fine!

1656
01:14:15,146 --> 01:14:16,103
I don't like you either!

1657
01:14:16,277 --> 01:14:17,670
Great! Oh-

1658
01:14:17,844 --> 01:14:19,585
And by the way in
case it wasn't obvious,

1659
01:14:19,759 --> 01:14:20,804
the trip is off.

1660
01:14:20,978 --> 01:14:22,458
You can keep your money.

1661
01:14:22,632 --> 01:14:24,242
I'll figure
something else out.

1662
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:26,549
Rob, wait!

1663
01:14:26,723 --> 01:14:28,115
I didn't mean that!

1664
01:14:32,946 --> 01:14:34,165
Mike!

1665
01:14:34,644 --> 01:14:36,472
I didn't write any
of that stuff.

1666
01:14:36,646 --> 01:14:38,561
And I don't condone it,
please, believe me.

1667
01:14:40,563 --> 01:14:41,912
Have you seen Tina?

1668
01:14:42,086 --> 01:14:44,305
I don't think she
wants to talk to you.

1669
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:45,872
Please, I can explain.

1670
01:14:46,046 --> 01:14:47,134
She's very busy, Charlotte.

1671
01:14:48,048 --> 01:14:49,833
I'm busy!

1672
01:14:50,007 --> 01:14:51,965
Being fat and mannish!

1673
01:14:54,838 --> 01:14:56,274
I think you should go.

1674
01:15:08,547 --> 01:15:09,505
Rob?

1675
01:15:11,637 --> 01:15:12,595
Rob.

1676
01:15:14,597 --> 01:15:16,512
Please just
open the door.

1677
01:15:18,644 --> 01:15:19,950
I-I-I need to explain.

1678
01:15:20,124 --> 01:15:22,126
Just
let me in, okay?

1679
01:15:28,785 --> 01:15:31,527
I'm so sorry for
what I said earlier.

1680
01:15:32,658 --> 01:15:33,833
I overreacted.

1681
01:15:36,706 --> 01:15:39,535
I was just
frustrated because

1682
01:15:39,709 --> 01:15:42,668
I've been trying
to tell you that

1683
01:15:43,713 --> 01:15:47,543
it's the network who wrote
those things, not me.

1684
01:15:47,717 --> 01:15:49,719
And I-I turned
down the show.

1685
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:53,374
I would never say those
things about you guys.

1686
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:54,680
If you-

1687
01:15:54,854 --> 01:15:57,117
If you could
just let me in

1688
01:15:57,291 --> 01:16:00,033
and I would explain everything
and you'd understand.

1689
01:16:01,339 --> 01:16:04,168
It's fine, Charlotte,
I forgive you.

1690
01:16:05,299 --> 01:16:06,692
Then why won't
you let me in?

1691
01:16:06,866 --> 01:16:08,825
I think you should
just go back home, okay?

1692
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:13,438
You and me, we live
in different worlds.

1693
01:16:13,612 --> 01:16:15,353
It was never gonna
work out anyway.

1694
01:16:16,006 --> 01:16:17,921
You're a nice girl, Charlotte.

1695
01:16:18,095 --> 01:16:20,576
But I think you should
just go back to Chicago.

1696
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:22,665
Go back to your life.

1697
01:16:24,797 --> 01:16:27,713
I've got some things I
need to do here, okay?

1698
01:16:29,106 --> 01:16:30,673
Goodbye, Charlotte.

1699
01:16:46,079 --> 01:16:47,733
I'm sorry you're
hurting, Char,

1700
01:16:47,907 --> 01:16:49,779
but I don't really understand
why you're getting rid

1701
01:16:49,953 --> 01:16:51,824
of all your stuff.

1702
01:16:51,998 --> 01:16:54,653
Well I just don't know why I
bought all this expensive junk.

1703
01:16:54,827 --> 01:16:56,524
I mean, who needs
fourteen scarves?

1704
01:16:56,699 --> 01:16:57,917
It's insane!

1705
01:16:58,309 --> 01:16:59,571
Are you sure you
wanna do that?

1706
01:16:59,745 --> 01:17:01,094
I mean, this was expensive.

1707
01:17:01,747 --> 01:17:02,922
You keep them.

1708
01:17:09,755 --> 01:17:10,713
What's up with you?

1709
01:17:11,714 --> 01:17:12,584
Why are you so happy?

1710
01:17:12,758 --> 01:17:13,716
I'm not happy.

1711
01:17:14,804 --> 01:17:16,283
No.

1712
01:17:16,457 --> 01:17:18,068
You look like you're
on cloud nine,

1713
01:17:18,242 --> 01:17:19,156
like you just met the
love of your life.

1714
01:17:21,201 --> 01:17:23,856
Wait, did you just meet
the love of your life?

1715
01:17:24,030 --> 01:17:25,249
Maybe.

1716
01:17:26,206 --> 01:17:27,077
Mal, that's great!

1717
01:17:27,251 --> 01:17:28,644
Tell me about him.

1718
01:17:28,818 --> 01:17:29,601
No, we-we don't have
to talk about him.

1719
01:17:29,775 --> 01:17:31,385
No, I want to.

1720
01:17:31,559 --> 01:17:34,171
Don't hide your happiness
because my life's a mess.

1721
01:17:35,738 --> 01:17:38,741
It's just, it's Ben,
Rob's brother.

1722
01:17:39,742 --> 01:17:41,657
Oh.

1723
01:17:41,831 --> 01:17:45,530
Yeah, he found me on Facebook
after that night at the Finley.

1724
01:17:45,704 --> 01:17:46,531
I'm sorry.

1725
01:17:46,705 --> 01:17:48,664
No, it's great.

1726
01:17:48,838 --> 01:17:49,708
Ben's great.

1727
01:17:49,882 --> 01:17:50,840
I'm really happy for you.

1728
01:17:51,014 --> 01:17:51,841
Really?

1729
01:17:52,015 --> 01:17:53,190
Yes, really.

1730
01:17:53,799 --> 01:17:54,974
You deserve it.

1731
01:17:57,934 --> 01:17:59,762
Do you want this?

1732
01:18:00,414 --> 01:18:01,807
Maybe.

1733
01:18:03,287 --> 01:18:04,984
I can't control
the wildlife, sir,

1734
01:18:05,158 --> 01:18:07,900
but we did see a moose
and a bald eagle.

1735
01:18:08,074 --> 01:18:09,946
You know what,

1736
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:12,078
you should try joining one of
our one week long excursions.

1737
01:18:12,252 --> 01:18:13,645
I can't guarantee that
you'll see a bear

1738
01:18:13,819 --> 01:18:15,778
but it-it-it has happened!

1739
01:18:18,737 --> 01:18:20,086
You know what?

1740
01:18:20,260 --> 01:18:22,698
You, you don't deserve
to see a bear.

1741
01:18:22,872 --> 01:18:24,090
You'll probably get
yourself killed if you did.

1742
01:18:24,264 --> 01:18:25,526
And you know what else,

1743
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:26,963
I don't care if you pay.

1744
01:18:27,137 --> 01:18:28,529
I don't care if
any of you pay.

1745
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:30,140
'Cause I quit.

1746
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:33,578
Rob Wilson, everyone.

1747
01:18:33,752 --> 01:18:35,885
Just practicing his
stand-up set for later.

1748
01:18:37,147 --> 01:18:39,323
He's not very funny.

1749
01:18:39,497 --> 01:18:41,325
And yeah, you have to pay.

1750
01:18:42,413 --> 01:18:43,719
How can I help you, ma'am?

1751
01:18:43,893 --> 01:18:45,285
I don't understand.

1752
01:18:45,459 --> 01:18:46,896
Why would you send
that terrible synopsis

1753
01:18:47,070 --> 01:18:48,419
to the TV executive?

1754
01:18:48,593 --> 01:18:49,899
It's not even what
the book is about.

1755
01:18:50,073 --> 01:18:51,727
Isn't it?

1756
01:18:51,901 --> 01:18:53,119
I'm sorry, Charlotte,
but I'm genuinely surprised

1757
01:18:53,293 --> 01:18:54,773
by your reaction.

1758
01:18:54,947 --> 01:18:55,861
That's what I got
from the pages.

1759
01:18:56,035 --> 01:18:57,341
I never called them names.

1760
01:18:57,515 --> 01:18:58,734
I never mocked them.

1761
01:18:58,908 --> 01:19:00,605
No, you didn't
use those terms

1762
01:19:00,779 --> 01:19:02,650
but it's pretty clear
you felt your way of life

1763
01:19:02,825 --> 01:19:05,175
was the correct way
and theirs was crazy.

1764
01:19:06,132 --> 01:19:08,831
These people have taught me some
of the most amazing things.

1765
01:19:09,005 --> 01:19:10,354
How to live life simply,

1766
01:19:10,528 --> 01:19:12,704
how to cook a
fish I caught.

1767
01:19:12,878 --> 01:19:14,793
They taught me how to
be less superficial

1768
01:19:14,967 --> 01:19:18,754
and how to just let go of
that need to be admired.

1769
01:19:18,928 --> 01:19:20,799
How to survive without
barely any belongings

1770
01:19:20,973 --> 01:19:22,975
and how to love deeply
and unconditionally.

1771
01:19:23,149 --> 01:19:25,021
Then that's what you
need to write about.

1772
01:19:36,902 --> 01:19:41,777
on more than words

1773
01:19:41,951 --> 01:19:46,303
of other things

1774
01:19:49,959 --> 01:19:54,877
different about this thing

1775
01:19:55,051 --> 01:19:59,751
in other places

1776
01:19:59,925 --> 01:20:04,103
things to say

1777
01:20:12,546 --> 01:20:15,723
leaps and beats

1778
01:20:15,898 --> 01:20:17,813
beats for me

1779
01:20:20,163 --> 01:20:24,950
acting differently

1780
01:20:25,124 --> 01:20:29,868
seen when to speak

1781
01:20:30,042 --> 01:20:34,351
little dancing fools

1782
01:20:39,878 --> 01:20:42,228
talk about it

1783
01:20:42,402 --> 01:20:45,231
leaps and beats

1784
01:20:47,494 --> 01:20:48,800
I love it.

1785
01:20:48,974 --> 01:20:49,845
Really?

1786
01:20:50,019 --> 01:20:51,455
Really.

1787
01:20:51,629 --> 01:20:52,673
And you know you never
have to be perfect

1788
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:54,023
around me, right?

1789
01:20:55,938 --> 01:20:56,852
Yeah I know.

1790
01:20:57,026 --> 01:20:58,636
Aw, come here.

1791
01:21:01,030 --> 01:21:01,987
Thank you.

1792
01:21:03,467 --> 01:21:05,991
I love you and all
of your failures.

1793
01:21:06,992 --> 01:21:07,819
All of them?

1794
01:21:07,993 --> 01:21:09,386
Every single one.

1795
01:21:09,995 --> 01:21:11,605
I haven't had that many.

1796
01:21:11,779 --> 01:21:13,999
Is there a specific one
you're referring to or?

1797
01:21:15,044 --> 01:21:16,306
Wow, you did it.

1798
01:21:30,973 --> 01:21:32,017
You read the book?

1799
01:21:32,191 --> 01:21:33,149
I skimmed it.

1800
01:21:34,237 --> 01:21:35,673
You gonna reach out?

1801
01:21:38,067 --> 01:21:39,242
Hmm.

1802
01:21:40,678 --> 01:21:42,245
Wanna know
what I think?

1803
01:21:45,030 --> 01:21:46,031
What's that?

1804
01:21:46,684 --> 01:21:49,513
I think she loves you.

1805
01:21:51,254 --> 01:21:53,604
And I think you
love her too.

1806
01:21:56,041 --> 01:21:56,912
Oh yeah?

1807
01:21:57,086 --> 01:21:58,261
Yeah.

1808
01:22:00,393 --> 01:22:02,961
And I think you
should go get her

1809
01:22:03,135 --> 01:22:05,094
and bring her back home.

1810
01:22:09,054 --> 01:22:10,621
You know what I think?
- Mm?

1811
01:22:12,057 --> 01:22:13,624
I think you're
probably right.

1812
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:22,894
I guess I'm going
to Chicago.

1813
01:22:23,068 --> 01:22:24,461
Go get her, tiger.

1814
01:22:30,728 --> 01:22:32,338
I know you're upset
about Rob, Charlotte,

1815
01:22:32,512 --> 01:22:34,297
but it really is
for the best.

1816
01:22:35,124 --> 01:22:36,777
What makes
you say that?

1817
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:38,127
Rob's the kind of guy
you date in college

1818
01:22:38,301 --> 01:22:39,998
when things are
fun and light

1819
01:22:40,172 --> 01:22:42,827
and you're looking for a piece
of eye candy on your arm.

1820
01:22:43,001 --> 01:22:44,785
But he's not the kind
of guy you marry.

1821
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:45,786
Why not?

1822
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:47,745
I mean,

1823
01:22:47,919 --> 01:22:48,876
what's the going rate for a
canoe instructor these days,

1824
01:22:49,051 --> 01:22:50,922
like seven dollars an hour?

1825
01:22:51,096 --> 01:22:52,315
Please, you wouldn't
be caught dead

1826
01:22:52,489 --> 01:22:54,099
marrying a
guy like him.

1827
01:22:54,273 --> 01:22:55,492
You know what?

1828
01:22:56,188 --> 01:22:59,452
A guy like him has more
class than you'll ever have.

1829
01:22:59,626 --> 01:23:00,888
Excuse me?

1830
01:23:01,063 --> 01:23:02,368
You heard me.

1831
01:23:02,542 --> 01:23:04,240
I'd be lucky to
marry a guy like him

1832
01:23:04,414 --> 01:23:06,982
but you wouldn't know that
because you're so shallow.

1833
01:23:07,504 --> 01:23:08,679
Hey!

1834
01:23:08,853 --> 01:23:10,072
What am I even
doing here?

1835
01:23:11,116 --> 01:23:12,074
I need to find Rob.

1836
01:23:14,119 --> 01:23:16,992
Okay, looks like
there's one seat left

1837
01:23:17,166 --> 01:23:19,168
on the next
flight to Chicago.

1838
01:23:20,212 --> 01:23:22,171
It's a little bit pricy
'cause it's so last minute.

1839
01:23:22,345 --> 01:23:23,607
Just book it.

1840
01:23:23,781 --> 01:23:25,130
I'll pay you back, okay?

1841
01:23:26,044 --> 01:23:27,002
Done.

1842
01:23:30,092 --> 01:23:31,528
Okay.

1843
01:23:32,703 --> 01:23:33,617
Thank you, Tina.

1844
01:23:33,791 --> 01:23:35,097
I really owe you one.

1845
01:23:35,706 --> 01:23:36,750
No problem.

1846
01:23:36,924 --> 01:23:37,882
Wish me luck.

1847
01:23:38,056 --> 01:23:38,926
Good luck.

1848
01:23:39,101 --> 01:23:40,276
Ooh!

1849
01:23:40,450 --> 01:23:41,799
Do you think I
could get a ride?

1850
01:23:42,234 --> 01:23:43,496
Well, sure.

1851
01:23:44,323 --> 01:23:45,411
Come on, let's go
get your girl.

1852
01:23:45,585 --> 01:23:46,891
Thank you.

1853
01:23:47,065 --> 01:23:48,110
So the Watering Hole
is right here

1854
01:23:48,284 --> 01:23:49,415
and then the cabins,

1855
01:23:49,589 --> 01:23:50,982
are just down this way.

1856
01:23:51,156 --> 01:23:52,201
Want me to drive?

1857
01:23:52,375 --> 01:23:53,376
No, I'll drive.

1858
01:23:55,813 --> 01:23:56,944
Charlotte?

1859
01:23:57,119 --> 01:23:57,989
Rob.

1860
01:23:58,163 --> 01:23:58,990
Here.
-Yeah.

1861
01:23:59,164 --> 01:24:00,122
Can you hold this?

1862
01:24:05,170 --> 01:24:06,128
Charlotte!

1863
01:24:06,302 --> 01:24:07,129
Rob.

1864
01:24:10,088 --> 01:24:10,871
What are you
doing here?

1865
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:12,177
I had to see you.

1866
01:24:12,351 --> 01:24:13,961
I was just coming
to see you.

1867
01:24:14,136 --> 01:24:15,311
I have been, I'm so sorry,
I've been such a jerk.

1868
01:24:15,485 --> 01:24:17,052
Oh no, I've
been the jerk.

1869
01:24:17,226 --> 01:24:18,836
I should have never
let you leave.

1870
01:24:20,403 --> 01:24:21,404
Hi.
-Hi.

1871
01:24:21,578 --> 01:24:22,927
I'm Tina.
-I'm Mallory.

1872
01:24:23,101 --> 01:24:24,189
Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

1873
01:24:27,236 --> 01:24:28,846
I read your book.

1874
01:24:30,195 --> 01:24:31,414
What'd you think?

1875
01:24:32,110 --> 01:24:35,026
I thought it
was incredible.

1876
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:39,161
It was so honest
and raw and-

1877
01:24:40,118 --> 01:24:43,295
I love you so much.

1878
01:24:44,166 --> 01:24:45,993
More than I've ever loved
anyone in my whole life

1879
01:24:46,168 --> 01:24:48,387
and I wanna be
with you and

1880
01:24:49,432 --> 01:24:52,348
I'll shout it to anyone
who cares to hear it out.

1881
01:24:53,479 --> 01:24:54,872
I love you too.

1882
01:24:57,875 --> 01:25:00,051
I know you live in
Chicago and I'm here,

1883
01:25:00,225 --> 01:25:01,096
but maybe if we-

1884
01:25:07,841 --> 01:25:09,234
My heart.

1885
01:25:15,414 --> 01:25:17,764
Why don't we split
our time in both places?

1886
01:25:22,726 --> 01:25:24,119
I don't care.

1887
01:25:24,293 --> 01:25:25,903
As long as we
can be together.

1888
01:25:30,255 --> 01:25:31,213
Sorry.
-No worries.

1889
01:25:34,259 --> 01:25:35,086
Everything okay?

1890
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:36,696
Ah, yeah.

1891
01:25:36,870 --> 01:25:39,003
Um, guys, hey, yeah,
sorry to interrupt.

1892
01:25:39,177 --> 01:25:41,179
I just got an email from
a different network.

1893
01:25:41,353 --> 01:25:42,920
They're interested
in a show

1894
01:25:43,094 --> 01:25:44,835
but more like the one
you originally pitched.

1895
01:25:45,662 --> 01:25:46,489
Seriously?

1896
01:25:46,663 --> 01:25:47,838
Yeah.

1897
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:53,017
I'll only do it on
one condition.

1898
01:25:56,716 --> 01:25:57,804
Take your hands,

1899
01:25:57,978 --> 01:25:59,458
rub them together
like that.

1900
01:25:59,632 --> 01:26:01,460
Try to get some nice
friction on that log.

1901
01:26:02,722 --> 01:26:03,984
That's great.

1902
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:05,334
You're doing great,
stay at it.

1903
01:26:06,335 --> 01:26:08,728
How's it going with that
tent over there, Charlotte?

1904
01:26:09,207 --> 01:26:11,601
Wow, this is super exciting,
isn't it?

1905
01:26:14,952 --> 01:26:17,346
To be honest,
Rob, not great.

1906
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:18,869
Not great at all.

1907
01:26:19,043 --> 01:26:20,349
Yeah, not looking too good.

1908
01:26:21,306 --> 01:26:22,133
By the way,

1909
01:26:22,307 --> 01:26:23,265
when all
else fails,

1910
01:26:24,309 --> 01:26:25,919
use matches.

1911
01:26:26,093 --> 01:26:27,399
Just make sure you
keep 'em in a dry bag.

1912
01:26:30,533 --> 01:26:31,360
Oh, hello.

1913
01:26:31,534 --> 01:26:32,578
Hi.

1914
01:26:32,752 --> 01:26:33,579
How are we?

1915
01:26:35,364 --> 01:26:39,324
on your back

1916
01:26:40,238 --> 01:26:44,199
doors I will not crack

1917
01:26:46,288 --> 01:26:51,597
so you would know
