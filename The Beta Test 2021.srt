00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:05,292
-Who was that?
-Andrea.

4
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:12,667
You okay?

5
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:17,083
Did you leave the sliding door open?

6
00:02:18,917 --> 00:02:19,917
No.

7
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:24,250
It's a bad habit leaving doors open.

8
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,792
Once the termites get in,
you can never get rid of them.

9
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,208
-Okay?
-Okay.

10
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,833
Everybody just wants to be famous.

11
00:02:40,542 --> 00:02:42,750
And for what?

12
00:02:43,542 --> 00:02:47,667
So we can pretend we're famous too...

13
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:50,583
but it's fucking fake, the whole thing.

14
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,667
Photoshop.

15
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,792
Hell, I could be famous

16
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,542
with these window-shoppers.

17
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,958
Be happy with what you've got.

18
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,083
You too, so easily manipulated.

19
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,458
I'll never understand it.

20
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:25,208
So I have to talk to you about something.

21
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:34,333
About a month ago, I got a purple letter,

22
00:03:34,417 --> 00:03:36,708
an anonymous letter

23
00:03:37,292 --> 00:03:42,708
inviting me to meet
an admirer in a hotel room.

24
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,042
I thought it was stupid.

25
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,167
I thought it might have been...

26
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,917
I don't know what I thought.

27
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,833
But I went, and it was once.

28
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:04,417
And I realized that I've been unhappy.

29
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,417
I am unhappy.

30
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:14,542
I've given you ten fantastic years,

31
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:18,916
years that I'll never regret.

32
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,708
But I'm asking you now to let me leave.

33
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:26,500
I don't want half of your money.

34
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,792
I think $5,000 is all I'll need
to start again.

35
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:47,042
I honestly don't know what got
into me, but I'm glad that it did.

36
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:52,958
Stop that.

37
00:04:56,083 --> 00:05:00,250
I can't justify staying with you anymore
just to be nice.

38
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:13,208
Because I saw it on your iPad
when it was syncing

39
00:39:13,292 --> 00:39:15,500
and then you deleted it from your phone!

40
00:39:15,583 --> 00:39:16,958
I don't know what you're talking about!

41
00:39:17,042 --> 00:39:19,792
How the fuck could you do this to me?

42
00:39:19,875 --> 00:39:22,083
It's really not what you think.

43
00:39:22,167 --> 00:39:26,708
Like I'm not going to have someone
follow you when you're acting like this?

44
00:39:26,792 --> 00:39:30,000
I stay in hotels all over the world!

45
00:39:30,083 --> 00:39:32,000
Not in our fucking neighborhood!

46
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:36,458
Calm down.

47
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:41,958
I don't have time for this.

48
00:39:42,042 --> 00:39:43,500
You're hysterical.

49
00:56:53,708 --> 00:56:56,167
Who is sick of everything regular?

50
00:57:14,083 --> 00:57:15,542
The public.
