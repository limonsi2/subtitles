3
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:28,473
Mr. Heathcliff?

4
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,411
I'm Lockwood, your
new tenant, sir,

5
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:34,579
at Thrushcross Grange.

6
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,582
I'll do myself the honor of
calling as soon as possible.

7
00:02:52,531 --> 00:02:55,935
I hope I've not inconvenienced
you in my arrival.

8
00:03:27,733 --> 00:03:30,569
I should not allow
anyone to inconvenience me

9
00:03:30,602 --> 00:03:31,637
if I could hinder it.

10
00:03:54,593 --> 00:03:56,762
I do wonder why you
should select the thick

11
00:03:56,796 --> 00:03:59,765
of a storm to ramble about in.

12
00:04:17,616 --> 00:04:21,419
From Thy bounty, through
Christ our Lord, amen.

13
00:05:15,241 --> 00:05:16,574
I don't think
it possible for me

14
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,610
to get home without a guide.

15
00:05:18,644 --> 00:05:21,546
Perhaps you could
spare one of your lads.

16
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:23,816
No, I could not.

17
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:28,054
I don't keep accommodations
for strangers.

18
00:05:28,921 --> 00:05:30,622
I shall sleep in a chair.

19
00:05:30,656 --> 00:05:32,490
A stranger is a stranger.

20
00:05:32,524 --> 00:05:34,226
If you wish to stay,
you can share a bed

21
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,594
with either Hareton or Joseph.

22
00:05:39,932 --> 00:05:43,568
Let this be a lesson
for you, Mr. Lockwood,

23
00:05:43,601 --> 00:05:45,972
to not go on any more
ramblings on the moors.

24
00:05:47,707 --> 00:05:49,809
I can go with him
as far as the park.

25
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,111
It would be hell.

26
00:07:03,682 --> 00:07:04,683
Follow me.

27
00:07:47,393 --> 00:07:49,962
Mind the candle, and
don't make a noise.

28
00:07:50,796 --> 00:07:53,799
My master has an odd
notion about this room.

29
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,085
Have a good night, sir.

30
00:11:22,608 --> 00:11:24,043
I'm so alone.

31
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:30,816
Cathy?

32
00:11:33,018 --> 00:11:34,086
You, out now.

33
00:11:47,566 --> 00:11:48,534
Don't leave.

34
00:11:55,107 --> 00:11:56,408
Come back to me.

35
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:00,412
Come back.

36
00:12:14,993 --> 00:12:18,464
This whole house is swarming
with ghosts and goblins.

37
00:12:18,497 --> 00:12:20,165
If that little fiend
would have gotten in,

38
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:22,234
she would have strangled
me, snatched my soul away.

39
00:12:24,503 --> 00:12:28,073
I'm not a fanciful man,
ma'am, nor a dishonest one.

40
00:12:30,275 --> 00:12:31,644
I saw her with my own eyes,

41
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:34,413
and felt her with
my very own hands.

42
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:37,049
Who was she?

43
00:12:41,487 --> 00:12:42,621
You have lived in
this neighborhood

44
00:12:42,655 --> 00:12:45,157
a considerable
time, have you not?

45
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,025
All my life, sir.

46
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:48,594
First here, and
then at the grange,

47
00:12:48,628 --> 00:12:50,095
when my mistress was married.

48
00:12:50,129 --> 00:12:51,363
The master retained
me for his housekeeper

49
00:12:51,397 --> 00:12:52,632
till he passed away.

50
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,502
Followed my second
mistress here.

51
00:12:56,535 --> 00:13:00,239
Indeed, then you have seen
a good many alterations.

52
00:13:00,272 --> 00:13:02,307
Aye, and a lot
of troubles too.

53
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,245
You knew her?

54
00:13:08,113 --> 00:13:09,948
This, Cathy.

55
00:13:13,118 --> 00:13:16,221
And Mr. Heathcliff,
he knew her as well?

56
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:21,193
He loved her, dare I say.

57
00:13:26,131 --> 00:13:28,267
He is a rather churlish man.

58
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:31,103
He must have led
a tumultuous life

59
00:13:31,136 --> 00:13:32,938
to make him such a rough fellow.

60
00:13:35,775 --> 00:13:38,977
Do you know anything
of his history?

61
00:13:41,146 --> 00:13:43,248
I know all about
it, Mr. Lockwood,

62
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:45,184
save for the
circumstances of his birth

63
00:13:45,217 --> 00:13:47,553
and how he got his fortune.

64
00:13:52,558 --> 00:13:53,726
It would be a
charitable deed to tell me

65
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,328
something of my
neighbors, Miss Dean.

66
00:13:56,361 --> 00:13:58,297
It's not a joyous tale.

67
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:00,532
There's not room for
smiles and laughter

68
00:14:00,566 --> 00:14:02,301
so much, just tears and remorse.

69
00:14:07,105 --> 00:14:08,474
I should like
to hear it still.

70
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:21,019
30 years ago, when I took
over my mother's position

71
00:14:21,053 --> 00:14:23,255
as housekeeper at
Wuthering Heights,

72
00:14:23,288 --> 00:14:26,558
Mr. Earnshaw, Cathy's father,

73
00:14:26,592 --> 00:14:29,027
was to return from
Liverpool that evening.

74
00:14:29,061 --> 00:14:30,797
We all eagerly
awaited his arrival

75
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:33,165
because he was to bring
a present for all of us.

76
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:36,568
A riding whip for Cathy, a
fiddle for brother Hindley.

77
00:14:38,705 --> 00:14:40,239
Your brother is studying.

78
00:14:42,074 --> 00:14:44,443
And some
apples and pears for me.

79
00:14:44,476 --> 00:14:46,111
Papa, Papa.

80
00:14:46,144 --> 00:14:48,213
Papa, we're so
glad you came home.

81
00:14:48,247 --> 00:14:50,148
I can see that.

82
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:50,984
Oh.

83
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:52,217
Catherine, give
your father a rest.

84
00:14:52,251 --> 00:14:53,352
He's had a long journey.

85
00:14:53,385 --> 00:14:54,654
Oh, oh oh oh.

86
00:14:55,822 --> 00:14:56,656
Come.

87
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,264
I brought you something.

88
00:15:05,297 --> 00:15:06,131
What
did you bring me?

89
00:15:06,164 --> 00:15:07,266
See here.

90
00:15:13,272 --> 00:15:15,374
Oh, what is it?

91
00:15:15,407 --> 00:15:16,375
A gift from God.

92
00:15:17,142 --> 00:15:18,711
A gift from the
devil, more like it.

93
00:15:18,745 --> 00:15:19,812
Quiet, girl.

94
00:15:19,846 --> 00:15:22,347
I found him starving in
the streets of Liverpool.

95
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:24,651
It was the Christian thing
to do to bring him home.

96
00:15:24,684 --> 00:15:27,185
How can you fashion
to bring this gypsy brat

97
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:29,321
into our home when we
have our own children

98
00:15:29,354 --> 00:15:30,556
to feed and care for?

99
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:31,824
I couldn't let him starve.

100
00:15:31,858 --> 00:15:34,359
Why not? Tends to
be what his kind do.

101
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:38,397
What's so special about
this dodgy foundling?

102
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:41,366
He's not my blood any
more than he is yours,

103
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,404
but he will be our son and
Hindley and Cathy's brother.

104
00:15:46,706 --> 00:15:48,708
An easy
conversion, no doubt.

105
00:15:58,584 --> 00:15:59,418
Cathy.

106
00:16:02,822 --> 00:16:04,657
Do you want to know
what I brought for you?

107
00:16:04,691 --> 00:16:05,825
Yes.

108
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:11,664
I brought you Heathcliff.

109
00:16:11,698 --> 00:16:13,766
Heathcliff? Heathcliff?

110
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:20,405
You've named this
after our brother?

111
00:16:21,473 --> 00:16:22,574
It is a befitting name.

112
00:16:23,676 --> 00:16:25,745
You hardly knew your brother,

113
00:16:25,778 --> 00:16:29,281
and Cathy was only a twinkle
in my eye when he passed.

114
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:35,454
Nelly, wash him and
find him some clothes.

115
00:16:35,487 --> 00:16:39,291
The rest of us, will go to bed.

116
00:16:54,841 --> 00:16:55,675
Come on.

117
00:16:58,377 --> 00:17:01,781
Dear God, thank
you for your mercy,

118
00:17:03,683 --> 00:17:06,385
and thank you for this bounty
we are about to receive.

119
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:13,225
And dear God, thank you for
the gift of Heathcliff, amen.

120
00:17:15,962 --> 00:17:17,362
Amen.

121
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:25,170
Here.

122
00:17:29,307 --> 00:17:30,409
It'll make you strong.

123
00:17:31,443 --> 00:17:32,477
Eat it up.

124
00:17:33,478 --> 00:17:35,414
Here, put this in your lap.

125
00:17:35,447 --> 00:17:37,750
Neat and tidy, huh?

126
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:46,491
From
the very beginning

127
00:17:46,525 --> 00:17:48,628
Heathcliff bred bad
feelings in the house.

128
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,398
Two years later,
Mrs. Earnshaw died,

129
00:17:53,432 --> 00:17:55,267
without ever seeing
Heathcliff as anything

130
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,402
but her husband's
ill-begotten bastard.

131
00:18:05,477 --> 00:18:08,881
After the mistress' death,
Hindley began to view his father

132
00:18:08,915 --> 00:18:10,683
as an oppressor
rather than a friend,

133
00:18:10,717 --> 00:18:14,352
and Heathcliff as an usurper
of his father's affections.

134
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:15,587
That's right, keep
that nice and clean.

135
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,890
Otherwise, the
powder will ignite.

136
00:18:17,924 --> 00:18:21,326
Very good. Now, see if you
can put that back down.

137
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:21,994
That's it.

138
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:26,598
That's right, now
hold this up here.

139
00:18:26,632 --> 00:18:29,334
All right, pull this out.
Go ahead and pull that out.

140
00:18:29,367 --> 00:18:31,436
And ram it down inside that.

141
00:18:47,552 --> 00:18:50,690
Heathcliff and
Cathy became inseparable.

142
00:18:50,723 --> 00:18:52,624
There wasn't a
place where one went

143
00:18:52,658 --> 00:18:54,459
where the other didn't follow.

144
00:19:19,719 --> 00:19:22,088
You're a dirty
gypsy, Heathcliff.

145
00:19:23,522 --> 00:19:24,690
I hate you.

146
00:19:30,997 --> 00:19:33,633
Finally, Arcure
advised Mr. Earnshaw

147
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,001
to send Hindley to college.

148
00:19:37,703 --> 00:19:42,574
Mr. Earnshaw agreed, but
he never thought Hindley

149
00:19:42,607 --> 00:19:44,677
would thrive, no matter
where he wandered.

150
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,746
I never believed.

151
00:19:46,779 --> 00:19:50,515
I was the only one who
truly cared for Hindley.

152
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:52,584
Until the night
of his departure,

153
00:19:52,617 --> 00:19:53,853
it seemed I would
be the only one

154
00:19:53,886 --> 00:19:55,520
who would regret his absence.

155
00:20:13,471 --> 00:20:14,339
Cathy?

156
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,746
Why can't you always
be a good lass?

157
00:20:22,849 --> 00:20:25,350
Why can't you always
be a good man, Father?

158
00:20:32,124 --> 00:20:33,759
Father?

159
00:20:33,793 --> 00:20:35,094
Father?

160
00:20:35,127 --> 00:20:36,062
Time for bed.

161
00:20:36,095 --> 00:20:36,929
Nelly!

162
00:20:39,632 --> 00:20:41,868
Day for your prayers, Mister.

163
00:20:47,707 --> 00:20:49,441
Mr. Earnshaw.

164
00:20:49,474 --> 00:20:50,575
Mr. Earnshaw?

165
00:21:00,753 --> 00:21:01,586
Cathy.

166
00:21:02,487 --> 00:21:06,424
Heathcliff, take Cathy
to bed. Back to bed.

167
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:07,693
Fetch Dr. Kenneth.

168
00:21:35,721 --> 00:21:38,691
You'll always be
Catherine Heathcliff.

169
00:21:38,724 --> 00:21:39,557
Forever.

170
00:21:45,164 --> 00:21:48,600
Tell me, Heathcliff,
where did you come from?

171
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:50,636
I don't remember.

172
00:21:52,939 --> 00:21:54,874
I don't remember
anything before you.

173
00:21:57,643 --> 00:21:59,879
I think you're a
prince in disguise.

174
00:22:02,715 --> 00:22:04,582
Your father was the
emperor of China,

175
00:22:05,718 --> 00:22:09,554
and your mother was
an Indian queen.

176
00:22:09,587 --> 00:22:11,691
And you were kidnapped
by wicked sailors

177
00:22:11,724 --> 00:22:13,591
and brought to England.

178
00:22:20,132 --> 00:22:21,499
You're worried
everything will change

179
00:22:21,533 --> 00:22:23,601
once Hindley
returns, aren't you?

180
00:22:25,171 --> 00:22:28,140
Well, with Father dead,
he does own the Heights.

181
00:22:28,174 --> 00:22:31,210
I won't have much to
protect me but my own wits.

182
00:22:31,243 --> 00:22:32,645
I shall protect you.

183
00:22:33,578 --> 00:22:36,916
My brother won't touch a
single black hair on your head.

184
00:22:39,819 --> 00:22:42,722
No one dare try to
take you away from me.

185
00:22:46,792 --> 00:22:48,493
Nor you from me.

186
00:22:51,864 --> 00:22:52,665
Hurry.

187
00:23:49,955 --> 00:23:53,125
No parson in the
world ever pictured heaven

188
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:54,960
so beautifully as they did.

189
00:23:56,729 --> 00:23:58,596
And I could not help wishing

190
00:23:58,631 --> 00:24:00,900
we were all there safe together.

191
00:24:16,649 --> 00:24:20,786
After his schooling,
Mr. Hindley came home

192
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:24,223
and set the neighbors
gossiping, right, left.

193
00:24:46,312 --> 00:24:47,847
He brought a wife with him.

194
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,315
Heathcliff.

195
00:24:49,348 --> 00:24:52,084
What she was
and where she was born...

196
00:24:52,118 --> 00:24:53,018
The horses.

197
00:24:53,052 --> 00:24:55,254
He never informed us.

198
00:25:02,728 --> 00:25:05,364
She had neither money nor
name to recommend her,

199
00:25:06,999 --> 00:25:10,002
or he would scarcely have kept
that union from his father.

200
00:25:29,355 --> 00:25:32,992
Young Earnshaw was
altered considerably

201
00:25:33,025 --> 00:25:34,727
in the years of his absence.

202
00:25:36,896 --> 00:25:39,131
Hello, Catherine. This
is my wife, Frances.

203
00:25:39,165 --> 00:25:40,733
Isn't this charming?

204
00:25:40,766 --> 00:25:43,302
This is my sister Catherine,
our housekeeper Nelly,

205
00:25:43,335 --> 00:25:45,004
and that was Joseph.

206
00:25:45,037 --> 00:25:46,805
Welcome to Wuthering
Heights, ma'am.

207
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:48,908
Cathy, Hindley's told
me so much about you.

208
00:25:48,941 --> 00:25:50,876
I've always wanted a
sister of my very own,

209
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,845
and now I have one.

210
00:25:52,878 --> 00:25:54,346
Oh, why don't you
show me around?

211
00:26:02,221 --> 00:26:03,923
From now on,
Nelly, you and Joseph are

212
00:26:03,956 --> 00:26:07,259
to stay in the servants'
quarters, where you belong.

213
00:26:07,293 --> 00:26:08,961
Of course, master.

214
00:26:10,362 --> 00:26:11,997
And as for you, Heathcliff,

215
00:26:13,532 --> 00:26:16,936
no more curate, and
stay in the stables.

216
00:26:17,703 --> 00:26:19,939
My wife and I want the
house to ourselves.

217
00:26:29,281 --> 00:26:32,318
Hindley
became tyrannical,

218
00:26:32,351 --> 00:26:35,521
evincing a dislike
to Heathcliff.

219
00:26:35,554 --> 00:26:38,257
He drove him from their
company to the servants',

220
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:40,226
deprived him of education,

221
00:26:40,259 --> 00:26:42,828
and insisted that he
should labor out of doors.

222
00:27:03,048 --> 00:27:06,418
It's horrible what
Hindley's done to you.

223
00:27:10,055 --> 00:27:11,991
Things will get better.

224
00:27:12,024 --> 00:27:14,960
It'll be all right.

225
00:27:14,994 --> 00:27:17,263
You do trust me, don't you?

226
00:27:21,166 --> 00:27:22,101
Of course.

227
00:27:26,872 --> 00:27:28,173
Good. Well then.

228
00:27:30,276 --> 00:27:32,144
I'm going to read to you.

229
00:27:39,318 --> 00:27:41,287
Where we were?

230
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,888
Heathcliff
bore his degradation

231
00:27:42,921 --> 00:27:44,423
fairly well at first,

232
00:27:44,456 --> 00:27:46,992
because Cathy taught
him what she learnt

233
00:27:47,026 --> 00:27:49,094
and worked or played
with him in the fields.

234
00:27:50,562 --> 00:27:54,033
They both promised fair to
grow up as unruly savages.

235
00:27:54,967 --> 00:27:57,469
The young master being
entirely negligent

236
00:27:57,503 --> 00:27:59,605
how they behaved
and what they did,

237
00:27:59,639 --> 00:28:01,607
so they kept clear of him.

238
00:28:01,641 --> 00:28:04,109
It was one of their chief
amusements to run away

239
00:28:04,143 --> 00:28:07,413
to the moors in the morning
and remain there all day.

240
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:12,051
They forgot everything the
minute they were together again.

241
00:28:13,653 --> 00:28:16,922
To seek revenge,
but leave a place

242
00:28:16,955 --> 00:28:18,891
for divine retribution.

243
00:28:18,924 --> 00:28:22,161
Never pay back evil for evil.

244
00:28:23,896 --> 00:28:27,866
Let your ills be such as
all men kept honorable.

245
00:28:29,468 --> 00:28:34,473
If possible, live at
peace with all men.

246
00:28:39,445 --> 00:28:42,514
What? Done already?

247
00:28:42,548 --> 00:28:44,383
I think
that's enough for today.

248
00:28:45,284 --> 00:28:47,186
When Father was
alive, we were permitted

249
00:28:47,219 --> 00:28:48,053
to play on Sundays.

250
00:28:48,087 --> 00:28:51,323
I don't give a
damn what Father did.

251
00:28:52,491 --> 00:28:55,327
This is my house
now. I am master.

252
00:28:55,361 --> 00:28:57,196
Hindley, let them be.

253
00:28:57,229 --> 00:28:59,998
If they want to run around
like savages, let them.

254
00:29:03,235 --> 00:29:04,336
Fine, off with you then.

255
00:29:28,293 --> 00:29:29,595
Here, look.

256
00:29:37,002 --> 00:29:39,071
It's beautiful, Heathcliff.

257
00:30:03,328 --> 00:30:05,497
That evening,
Hindley, in a passion,

258
00:30:05,531 --> 00:30:07,099
told us to bolt the doors

259
00:30:07,132 --> 00:30:09,601
and swore nobody should
let them in that night.

260
00:30:11,203 --> 00:30:13,305
The household went to
bed, but I was determined

261
00:30:13,338 --> 00:30:16,041
to admit them in spite
of the prohibition,

262
00:30:16,074 --> 00:30:17,142
once they returned.

263
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:20,112
Heathcliff, look.

264
00:30:20,145 --> 00:30:22,948
There's marigold at the grange.

265
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:28,120
I wonder how the Lintons
pass their Sunday evenings.

266
00:30:28,153 --> 00:30:30,189
Standing around
shivering in corners

267
00:30:30,222 --> 00:30:32,558
while the help burn their
eyes out by the fire.

268
00:30:43,168 --> 00:30:43,770
Cathy.

269
00:30:48,775 --> 00:30:50,576
Thrushcross Grange.

270
00:30:52,244 --> 00:30:56,415
Your new home, Mr. Lockwood,
was once home to the Lintons,

271
00:30:57,115 --> 00:30:59,351
a proud family of landed gentry.

272
00:31:03,422 --> 00:31:06,191
Old Mr. Linton had
long since passed,

273
00:31:06,225 --> 00:31:10,596
but he left two spirited
children, Isabella and Edgar.

274
00:31:17,536 --> 00:31:21,306
They had all the grange
entirely to themselves.

275
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,208
Shouldn't they have been happy?

276
00:31:23,242 --> 00:31:25,444
We should have thought
ourselves in heaven.

277
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:43,228
And now, guess what those
good children were doing.

278
00:31:44,062 --> 00:31:47,132
Livelier,
Isabella, livelier.

279
00:31:54,841 --> 00:31:56,408
Livelier.

280
00:32:02,247 --> 00:32:05,718
Don't you wish you had
been adopted by the Lintons?

281
00:32:10,857 --> 00:32:11,991
Livelier, live...

282
00:32:12,025 --> 00:32:14,861
I am playing it lively. You
sit down and play it then.

283
00:32:19,598 --> 00:32:21,466
There's
somebody out there.

284
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,235
They haven't seen us.

285
00:32:23,268 --> 00:32:24,136
Men!

286
00:32:31,844 --> 00:32:33,680
Heathcliff!

287
00:32:38,885 --> 00:32:41,553
Heathcliff, bring her in here.

288
00:32:41,587 --> 00:32:43,188
You can lay her right there.

289
00:32:44,356 --> 00:32:45,524
I have sent one of my
men for Dr. Kenneth.

290
00:32:45,557 --> 00:32:47,359
He will be here within the hour.

291
00:32:48,661 --> 00:32:50,395
Miss, where does it hurt?

292
00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:52,364
Don't don't, don't
touch her. Please, please.

293
00:32:53,498 --> 00:32:55,300
Sir.

294
00:32:55,334 --> 00:32:59,338
No no, no no. Don't
touch her please.

295
00:32:59,371 --> 00:33:00,405
Please.

296
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:01,306
Sir.

297
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,141
Get away.

298
00:33:03,175 --> 00:33:05,143
Sir, if you cannot
behave civilized,

299
00:33:05,177 --> 00:33:07,346
then I will have to
ask you to leave.

300
00:33:07,379 --> 00:33:09,348
If you're not
sure, we'll wait for the doctor.

301
00:33:11,483 --> 00:33:12,317
Fine.

302
00:33:14,186 --> 00:33:15,655
But I can't leave Cathy here.

303
00:33:17,189 --> 00:33:19,257
Let me tend to her.

304
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:20,559
Please, no, please. Please.

305
00:33:22,561 --> 00:33:24,229
Seamus.

306
00:33:24,262 --> 00:33:26,899
Your presence,
sire, is no longer required.

307
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,144
Do not worry.

308
00:33:39,879 --> 00:33:41,513
She will be well taken care of.

309
00:33:44,416 --> 00:33:46,719
She will be well cared for.

310
00:33:53,693 --> 00:33:57,596
Look
at the state of her.

311
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:01,299
I need to have.

312
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:02,601
My word.

313
00:34:02,635 --> 00:34:03,970
I shall have to talk
to Hindley Earnshaw

314
00:34:04,003 --> 00:34:05,404
about his gypsy brother.

315
00:34:15,313 --> 00:34:17,917
Perhaps she would benefit
from staying here for a while.

316
00:36:08,828 --> 00:36:12,932
Cathy stayed at
Thrushcross Grange five weeks.

317
00:36:12,965 --> 00:36:15,635
By that time, her ankle
was thoroughly cured

318
00:36:15,668 --> 00:36:18,037
and her manners much improved.

319
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:20,706
Mr. Linton commenced a
plan of reform by raising

320
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:24,376
her self-respect with
fine clothes and flattery,

321
00:36:24,409 --> 00:36:25,745
which she readily took.

322
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:30,482
Remember, Heathcliff,
if I am to allow you

323
00:36:30,515 --> 00:36:33,686
to stay here at the Heights,
you are not to speak to Cathy.

324
00:36:36,722 --> 00:36:38,925
Not unless it
involves her horse.

325
00:36:54,173 --> 00:36:55,975
Brother.

326
00:36:56,008 --> 00:37:00,713
So that, instead of
a wild hapless little sage,

327
00:37:00,746 --> 00:37:05,617
there lighted a very
dignified person.

328
00:37:05,651 --> 00:37:07,419
Oh, Heathcliff,
you may come forward

329
00:37:07,452 --> 00:37:09,055
and wish Miss Cathy welcome.

330
00:37:10,622 --> 00:37:11,724
Heathcliff.

331
00:37:14,994 --> 00:37:16,394
Have you forgotten all about me?

332
00:37:16,428 --> 00:37:18,430
Shake hands with
her, Heathcliff.

333
00:37:18,463 --> 00:37:20,132
Surely that's permitted.

334
00:37:23,636 --> 00:37:25,071
Heathcliff,
what have you been

335
00:37:25,104 --> 00:37:26,672
doing with yourself?

336
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:34,680
I won't stand
to be laughed at.

337
00:37:34,714 --> 00:37:37,382
I didn't mean to laugh.
I couldn't handle myself.

338
00:37:38,617 --> 00:37:40,052
Look how dirty you are.

339
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,061
You look lovely, Cath.

340
00:37:56,168 --> 00:37:59,604
And on that note,
let's go in, shall we?

341
00:38:06,946 --> 00:38:09,715
May I present a toast
to our guests the Lintons.

342
00:38:09,749 --> 00:38:14,020
Edgar, Isabella, I bid you
welcome to Wuthering Heights.

343
00:38:14,053 --> 00:38:16,689
Why thank you, Hindley.
Happy to be here.

344
00:38:17,723 --> 00:38:20,693
It's marvelous pears
this year, quite a yield.

345
00:38:35,708 --> 00:38:36,709
Nelly?

346
00:38:39,145 --> 00:38:39,979
Can you

347
00:38:41,914 --> 00:38:43,515
make me decent?

348
00:38:45,918 --> 00:38:47,920
High time time, Heathcliff.

349
00:38:47,954 --> 00:38:49,487
You know, proud
people often breed

350
00:38:49,521 --> 00:38:50,756
sad sorrows for themselves.

351
00:38:51,757 --> 00:38:54,727
I believe a few of Mr.
Earnshaw's old clothes

352
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,062
are in the attic.

353
00:38:56,095 --> 00:38:59,198
As soon as I can steal
time, I'll help you.

354
00:38:59,231 --> 00:39:01,667
Edgar Linton will look
like a dog compared to you.

355
00:39:10,209 --> 00:39:12,678
What are you doing in here?

356
00:39:14,847 --> 00:39:18,951
This is a place for civilized
ladies and gentlemen,

357
00:39:18,985 --> 00:39:21,887
not for dirty gypsies.

358
00:39:33,833 --> 00:39:35,668
Wait!

359
00:39:35,701 --> 00:39:38,671
Till I take hold of those
elegant locks of yours,

360
00:39:38,704 --> 00:39:42,607
see if I can't pull them
out a little longer.

361
00:39:46,979 --> 00:39:48,681
I think they're long enough.

362
00:39:49,949 --> 00:39:51,884
Look's like a colt's
mane.

363
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:58,724
Oh!

364
00:39:59,859 --> 00:40:01,260
No, Heathcliff!

365
00:40:10,836 --> 00:40:12,872
Back to the stables.

366
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:14,740
Excuse us.

367
00:40:25,151 --> 00:40:25,985
Fight!

368
00:40:26,852 --> 00:40:28,620
I told you to fight back!

369
00:40:28,654 --> 00:40:29,955
Now you must!

370
00:40:58,818 --> 00:41:02,922
You were no more
his son than I was.

371
00:41:16,735 --> 00:41:21,740
Joseph, I have to go give my
father's coat another brushing.

372
00:41:26,045 --> 00:41:30,950
Next time, Edgar, take
the law to your fists.

373
00:41:33,853 --> 00:41:35,620
It will give you an appetite.

374
00:41:39,058 --> 00:41:44,063
Now then, who's up
for a round of bridge?

375
00:43:09,215 --> 00:43:13,085
Heathcliff, it's for
God to punish the wicked.

376
00:43:15,955 --> 00:43:17,923
We must learn to forgive.

377
00:44:01,033 --> 00:44:04,937
On that morning, my
first bonny little nursling

378
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:08,307
and the last of the ancient
Earnshaw stock was born.

379
00:44:09,875 --> 00:44:10,509
How's the babe?

380
00:44:19,285 --> 00:44:22,254
Nearly ready to
run about, Nelly.

381
00:44:22,288 --> 00:44:23,122
And Frances?

382
00:44:27,393 --> 00:44:32,398
She'll be perfectly well
by this time next week.

383
00:44:34,166 --> 00:44:35,067
But Dr. Kenneth...

384
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:36,035
Damn him!

385
00:44:41,106 --> 00:44:43,008
Damn the doctor.

386
00:44:45,944 --> 00:44:47,179
I'll go and see to her.

387
00:44:51,483 --> 00:44:52,885
Where's Cathy?

388
00:44:52,918 --> 00:44:54,586
With Mr. Linton.

389
00:45:19,111 --> 00:45:20,279
He's so big.

390
00:45:54,012 --> 00:45:55,849
I'm going to name him Hareton.

391
00:45:59,418 --> 00:46:01,553
Hindley had an
ancestor named Hareton.

392
00:46:03,522 --> 00:46:06,225
It is a good family name.

393
00:46:06,258 --> 00:46:07,259
Happy mum.

394
00:46:11,163 --> 00:46:16,168
Hareton Earnshaw, promise me
you'll look after him, Nelly.

395
00:46:20,139 --> 00:46:22,642
You'll love him like your own.

396
00:46:24,543 --> 00:46:26,545
Oh, it was
such a grand bairn.

397
00:46:28,013 --> 00:46:29,515
The finest lad
that ever breathed.

398
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:36,021
And, Frances, she'd been in
consumption for many months.

399
00:46:36,054 --> 00:46:38,190
She had nothing to keep her.

400
00:46:38,223 --> 00:46:40,125
The other side.
The other side.

401
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:41,994
You going somewhere?

402
00:46:42,027 --> 00:46:42,662
No.

403
00:46:46,365 --> 00:46:48,635
What do you got that
silly frock on for then?

404
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:54,339
Edgar Linton's supposed
to call here this afternoon.

405
00:46:55,274 --> 00:46:56,542
Edgar Linton.

406
00:47:00,145 --> 00:47:02,548
Catherine and he
were constant companions,

407
00:47:02,581 --> 00:47:05,284
still, at his seasons
of respite from labor.

408
00:47:06,285 --> 00:47:08,287
That's six weeks in a
row you've turned me out

409
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:11,356
for that pitiful
friend of yours again.

410
00:47:12,692 --> 00:47:14,661
What have you got there?

411
00:47:14,694 --> 00:47:15,829
Oh, that's very foolish.

412
00:47:15,862 --> 00:47:18,997
As if I were to take notice.
Where's the sense in that?

413
00:47:19,031 --> 00:47:21,668
To show you that
I take notice.

414
00:47:23,402 --> 00:47:25,604
Here, look. Look here.

415
00:47:29,141 --> 00:47:31,276
But he ceased
to express his fondness

416
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:35,547
for her in words, and
recoiled with angry suspicion

417
00:47:35,581 --> 00:47:37,182
from her girlish caresses.

418
00:47:37,216 --> 00:47:39,485
Every mark here
is a mark that you

419
00:47:39,518 --> 00:47:42,020
have spent with Linton.

420
00:47:42,054 --> 00:47:43,656
These marks are days with me.

421
00:47:48,695 --> 00:47:50,229
Must I always
be simple to you?

422
00:47:52,832 --> 00:47:56,034
You might be dumb for anything
you say to amuse me.

423
00:47:59,238 --> 00:48:02,207
As if conscious, there
could be no gratification

424
00:48:02,241 --> 00:48:04,677
in lavishing such marks
of affection on him.

425
00:48:06,178 --> 00:48:09,348
Never knew that
I talked too little

426
00:48:09,381 --> 00:48:11,250
that you disliked
my company, Cathy.

427
00:48:12,685 --> 00:48:15,354
There's no company at all
when people know nothing.

428
00:48:15,387 --> 00:48:16,588
Say nothing.

429
00:48:59,264 --> 00:49:00,800
Heathcliff!

430
00:49:16,281 --> 00:49:17,316
Where is my son?

431
00:49:17,349 --> 00:49:18,383
Sh.

432
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,689
He's right here, Mr. Hindley.

433
00:49:22,722 --> 00:49:23,856
Well then, let me hold him.

434
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:25,324
You're too drunk.

435
00:49:25,357 --> 00:49:26,793
I'm his father. I'm
not going to hurt him.

436
00:49:26,826 --> 00:49:31,163
You're a drunkard and a
poor excuse for a father.

437
00:49:47,245 --> 00:49:48,380
It's all right, Heathcliff.

438
00:49:48,413 --> 00:49:51,583
You can take a moment before
you return to the stables.

439
00:49:51,617 --> 00:49:54,152
Just remember to brush
them before you turn in.

440
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,557
One more thing, don't
tell Mr. Hindley.

441
00:50:03,595 --> 00:50:04,396
Nelly.

442
00:50:07,867 --> 00:50:09,568
Your tongue has grown
rather sharp of late, Nelly.

443
00:50:09,601 --> 00:50:11,570
Get your hands off of me.

444
00:50:14,339 --> 00:50:16,608
I never noticed
what a woman you are.

445
00:50:16,643 --> 00:50:18,477
Now's not the
time to take notice.

446
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:22,447
I could kill you for
speaking back to me.

447
00:50:24,616 --> 00:50:29,354
Don't listen then. I
have to know my place.

448
00:50:53,545 --> 00:50:57,382
Catherine, our time
together has been,

449
00:50:58,751 --> 00:51:00,552
well, just lovely.

450
00:51:05,892 --> 00:51:10,897
And, I feel we should
spend more time together.

451
00:51:14,901 --> 00:51:17,870
I guess what I'm
trying to say is...

452
00:51:24,409 --> 00:51:26,478
there's nothing that
would make me happier

453
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:30,582
than if you'd take
my hand of marriage.

454
00:52:13,425 --> 00:52:15,327
Are you alone, Nelly?

455
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,294
Yes, Miss.

456
00:52:17,063 --> 00:52:18,664
Will you keep a secret for me?

457
00:52:19,498 --> 00:52:20,599
Is it worth keeping?

458
00:52:22,935 --> 00:52:25,671
Today, Edgar Linton
asked me to marry him.

459
00:52:25,705 --> 00:52:26,571
And I accepted.

460
00:52:29,809 --> 00:52:31,610
Do you love Mr. Edgar?

461
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:33,913
Of course I do.
Who could help it?

462
00:52:33,946 --> 00:52:35,413
Why do you love him?

463
00:52:36,816 --> 00:52:38,918
Because he's handsome
and pleasant to be with.

464
00:52:38,951 --> 00:52:40,086
Bad.

465
00:52:40,119 --> 00:52:42,521
Because he's
young and cheerful.

466
00:52:42,554 --> 00:52:43,555
Bad still.

467
00:52:45,658 --> 00:52:46,826
Because he shall be rich.

468
00:52:48,761 --> 00:52:51,631
And I shall be the greatest
woman in the neighborhood.

469
00:52:51,664 --> 00:52:53,800
Worst of all.

470
00:52:53,833 --> 00:52:55,534
You're making jest of it!

471
00:52:55,567 --> 00:52:57,435
I'm very far from making
jest of it, Miss Cathy.

472
00:52:57,469 --> 00:53:00,605
It doesn't matter what
you say. I shall marry him.

473
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,676
Very well. Your
brother will be pleased.

474
00:53:04,609 --> 00:53:06,779
You will escape a
disorderly coupleless home

475
00:53:06,813 --> 00:53:08,714
in favor of a wealthy
respectable one.

476
00:53:10,082 --> 00:53:13,786
If you love Edgar,
and Edgar loves you,

477
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:16,354
all will be smooth and easy.

478
00:53:17,089 --> 00:53:18,925
Where's your obstacle?

479
00:53:23,595 --> 00:53:25,430
Here, near my heart,

480
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,467
near my soul.

481
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:34,073
I'm convinced I'm doing wrong.

482
00:53:35,808 --> 00:53:39,812
Nelly, have you ever
had bad dreams at night?

483
00:53:39,846 --> 00:53:41,080
Now and then.

484
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:46,484
I dreamt I was in heaven once,

485
00:53:48,154 --> 00:53:49,722
and I was miserable there.

486
00:53:51,556 --> 00:53:53,458
And I broke my
heart with weeping.

487
00:53:54,961 --> 00:53:58,798
And the angels were so angry
that they thrust me out

488
00:53:58,831 --> 00:54:03,501
right into the, right on
top of Wuthering Heights.

489
00:54:05,972 --> 00:54:09,642
And I woke up sobbing for joy.

490
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:13,612
Don't you see, Nelly?

491
00:54:13,646 --> 00:54:15,580
I have no more right
to marry Edgar Linton

492
00:54:15,614 --> 00:54:17,850
than I have to be in heaven?

493
00:54:20,552 --> 00:54:22,822
And if Hindley had not
brought Heathcliff so low,

494
00:54:23,723 --> 00:54:25,892
I would have never
thought to marry Edgar.

495
00:54:26,859 --> 00:54:30,528
But to marry Heathcliff
now would degrade me.

496
00:54:38,905 --> 00:54:41,473
So he shall never know
how much I love him,

497
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:45,678
and my great misery
seeing his world diminish.

498
00:54:46,679 --> 00:54:48,047
I have watched him run him off.

499
00:54:51,651 --> 00:54:54,887
And my great thought
in living exists.

500
00:54:54,921 --> 00:54:59,457
My love for Edgar is like
the foliage in the forest.

501
00:55:02,795 --> 00:55:06,598
Time will change it, as
winter changes the trees.

502
00:55:09,501 --> 00:55:14,206
My love for Heathcliff is like
the eternal rocks beneath.

503
00:55:15,775 --> 00:55:18,911
A source of little visible
pleasure but vital.

504
00:55:25,685 --> 00:55:27,585
I am Heathcliff, Nelly.

505
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:31,090
He is always, always in my mind.

506
00:55:32,692 --> 00:55:36,696
But not as a pleasure to
myself but as my own being.

507
00:55:38,164 --> 00:55:42,034
Miss Cathy, Heathcliff
might have been listening.

508
00:55:44,569 --> 00:55:49,574
He left when you said it would
do you disgrace to marry him.

509
00:55:50,009 --> 00:55:51,811
No!

510
00:55:51,844 --> 00:55:52,812
No!

511
00:55:52,845 --> 00:55:54,981
- Miss Cathy!
- Heathcliff!

512
00:56:03,789 --> 00:56:05,992
It was a very
dark evening for summer.

513
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:10,730
A storm came rattling over
the Heights, full of fury.

514
00:56:12,298 --> 00:56:15,567
Catherine would not be
persuaded into tranquility.

515
00:56:16,302 --> 00:56:18,871
She kept wandering to and fro,

516
00:56:19,504 --> 00:56:21,674
heedless of the growing thunder,

517
00:56:21,707 --> 00:56:24,710
and the great drops that
began to splash around her.

518
00:56:26,946 --> 00:56:30,716
She remained,
calling at intervals,

519
00:56:31,917 --> 00:56:35,553
and then listening, and
then crying outright.

520
00:56:37,223 --> 00:56:39,792
She cried for
Heathcliff all night,

521
00:56:40,826 --> 00:56:43,863
till she was greeted by the
warmth of the rising sun.

522
00:56:46,732 --> 00:56:49,168
Where the hell have you been?

523
00:56:55,374 --> 00:56:56,208
Outside.

524
00:57:01,047 --> 00:57:03,015
Were you with Heathcliff?

525
00:57:07,186 --> 00:57:08,888
I never saw him.

526
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:11,824
Well.

527
00:57:15,227 --> 00:57:20,166
When he comes back,
I'll throw him out.

528
00:57:20,199 --> 00:57:22,301
I've had enough of
that gypsy bastard.

529
00:57:25,905 --> 00:57:27,572
You won't get
your opportunity.

530
00:57:30,743 --> 00:57:31,576
He's gone.

531
00:57:35,247 --> 00:57:36,148
I lost him.

532
00:57:38,951 --> 00:57:40,119
I've lost him.

533
00:57:43,389 --> 00:57:44,290
I lost him.

534
00:57:46,926 --> 00:57:49,128
I've lost him! I've lost him!

535
00:57:51,897 --> 00:57:55,167
I've lost him!

536
00:58:42,448 --> 00:58:43,883
I don't have to go.

537
00:58:43,916 --> 00:58:45,384
They have plenty of
maids at the Grange

538
00:58:45,417 --> 00:58:46,952
to take care of Miss Cathy.

539
00:58:46,986 --> 00:58:47,920
I can stay here with
you and Hareton.

540
00:58:47,953 --> 00:58:50,756
There's no use for you here.

541
00:58:52,191 --> 00:58:54,927
I want no women in this house.

542
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,395
But Hareton needs
a mother, sir.

543
00:58:56,428 --> 00:58:58,364
He had a mother. She left him.

544
00:59:00,499 --> 00:59:02,701
She left me.

545
00:59:04,203 --> 00:59:05,671
Frances loved you, sir.

546
00:59:06,739 --> 00:59:09,008
I'm sure it would break her
heart to see you like this.

547
00:59:19,952 --> 00:59:21,921
Goodbye, Angel.

548
00:59:36,335 --> 00:59:38,504
Edgar Linton
believed himself

549
00:59:38,537 --> 00:59:41,307
the happiest man alive
on the day he led

550
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:43,142
Miss Cathy to Gimmerton Chapel.

551
00:59:44,076 --> 00:59:46,378
He offered me magnificent wages,

552
00:59:46,412 --> 00:59:49,248
and so I had but
one choice left,

553
00:59:49,281 --> 00:59:50,482
to do as I was ordered.

554
00:59:51,450 --> 00:59:55,054
And since then Hareton
has been a stranger.

555
01:01:04,123 --> 01:01:06,892
Come on, fella, come on.

556
01:01:06,925 --> 01:01:09,395
Hindley had mortgaged
every yard of land he owned

557
01:01:09,428 --> 01:01:13,165
for cash to supply his
mania for gaming, drinking,

558
01:01:13,198 --> 01:01:16,902
becoming something less than
a man, let alone a father.

559
01:01:29,048 --> 01:01:32,084
I got Miss Catherine and
myself to Thrushcross Grange,

560
01:01:32,117 --> 01:01:34,620
and to my agreeable
disappointment,

561
01:01:34,654 --> 01:01:37,556
she behaved infinitely
better than I dared expect.

562
01:01:38,457 --> 01:01:41,593
She seemed almost
overfond of Mr. Linton,

563
01:01:41,627 --> 01:01:44,496
and even to his sister she
showed plenty of affection.

564
01:01:46,198 --> 01:01:49,001
I believe I may assert that
they were really in possession

565
01:01:49,034 --> 01:01:51,170
of deep and growing happiness.

566
01:01:52,571 --> 01:01:57,543
But on a mellow evening
in September, it ended.

567
01:02:00,045 --> 01:02:04,083
His cheeks were covered,
his brows lowered.

568
01:02:08,287 --> 01:02:09,922
I remembered the eyes.

569
01:02:26,673 --> 01:02:27,506
Excuse me, sir.

570
01:02:29,041 --> 01:02:30,275
Yes.

571
01:02:30,309 --> 01:02:32,511
A person from Gimmerton
wishes to see you, ma'am.

572
01:02:33,545 --> 01:02:34,580
What do they want?

573
01:02:34,613 --> 01:02:36,482
I didn't question him.

574
01:02:36,515 --> 01:02:38,517
It's not one of
Hindley's creditors, is it?

575
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:41,286
No, someone the
mistress doesn't expect.

576
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:49,161
Shall I continue?

577
01:02:49,194 --> 01:02:50,229
Please.

578
01:03:00,038 --> 01:03:01,039
Heathcliff.

579
01:03:09,114 --> 01:03:10,282
I thought I've
never been alive

580
01:03:10,315 --> 01:03:12,284
since the last I saw your face.

581
01:03:14,119 --> 01:03:15,187
Forgive me.

582
01:03:17,322 --> 01:03:19,391
I struggled only for you.

583
01:03:35,073 --> 01:03:36,308
Edgar, Edgar!

584
01:03:38,210 --> 01:03:40,112
Heathcliff's come back!

585
01:03:43,148 --> 01:03:45,417
Try to be glad
without being absurd

586
01:03:45,451 --> 01:03:47,252
in front of the whole household.

587
01:03:55,427 --> 01:03:57,196
Ah, Mr. Heathcliff.

588
01:03:58,063 --> 01:04:00,165
Please, sit down.

589
01:04:05,304 --> 01:04:08,106
Mrs. Linton would have me
give you a cordial reception.

590
01:04:09,107 --> 01:04:11,009
Of course I am gratified with
anything that pleases her.

591
01:04:11,043 --> 01:04:12,745
As am I, especially
when it is anything

592
01:04:12,779 --> 01:04:14,146
in which I have a part.

593
01:04:17,282 --> 01:04:18,450
Thank you, Nelly.

594
01:04:24,623 --> 01:04:29,428
Well, tell us, where have
you been the last few years?

595
01:04:30,462 --> 01:04:31,664
Abroad?

596
01:04:31,698 --> 01:04:32,531
Yes.

597
01:04:33,833 --> 01:04:35,067
Soldiering perhaps?

598
01:04:38,237 --> 01:04:39,071
Yes.

599
01:04:40,807 --> 01:04:43,342
I shall
think it a dream tomorrow,

600
01:04:43,375 --> 01:04:45,577
to have seen and touched
and spoken to you.

601
01:04:47,212 --> 01:04:51,350
Yet, cruel Heathcliff, you
don't deserve this welcome.

602
01:04:51,383 --> 01:04:53,218
To be absent and
silent for three years

603
01:04:53,252 --> 01:04:55,153
and to never think of me.

604
01:04:55,187 --> 01:04:57,022
A little more than
you thought of me.

605
01:05:00,259 --> 01:05:02,060
I heard of your marriage.

606
01:05:04,296 --> 01:05:06,398
Where are you
staying, Gimmerton?

607
01:05:07,734 --> 01:05:08,600
No.

608
01:05:10,703 --> 01:05:11,905
At Wuthering Heights.

609
01:05:11,938 --> 01:05:14,373
Hindley Earnshaw invited you
to stay at Wuthering Heights?

610
01:05:14,406 --> 01:05:17,109
No, it is I who have
invited him to stay.

611
01:05:18,277 --> 01:05:19,712
Seems Hindley
mortgaged the property

612
01:05:19,746 --> 01:05:21,580
to pay for his gambling debts.

613
01:05:23,148 --> 01:05:26,285
I managed to help my
brother with his finances.

614
01:05:26,318 --> 01:05:28,487
I am the owner of
Wuthering Heights now.

615
01:05:39,498 --> 01:05:43,435
Well, hm, I'm eager to see
what you do with the place.

616
01:05:53,178 --> 01:05:57,349
Cathy, do you think I
could maybe speak to you?

617
01:05:59,251 --> 01:06:01,420
Isabella, can you leave us?

618
01:06:10,763 --> 01:06:13,599
We've both been
through so much.

619
01:06:15,434 --> 01:06:19,806
Please, please, we can
undo what was done.

620
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:21,440
And now I have
come back for you.

621
01:06:28,413 --> 01:06:29,247
Mm.

622
01:06:31,516 --> 01:06:34,286
Where do you expect to
take us, Heathcliff?

623
01:06:36,689 --> 01:06:39,792
Away from here.
Away from all this.

624
01:06:39,826 --> 01:06:43,428
I've seen the world now,
Cathy, and it is beautiful.

625
01:06:44,964 --> 01:06:45,832
Come with me.

626
01:06:50,770 --> 01:06:51,871
Heathcliff, I can't.

627
01:06:54,339 --> 01:06:57,342
I'm having, I'm
having Edgar's child.

628
01:07:05,517 --> 01:07:07,386
How can you do
this to me, Cathy?

629
01:07:08,353 --> 01:07:11,791
How can I do it? You're
a fine one to talk.

630
01:07:11,824 --> 01:07:13,225
You weren't there.

631
01:07:13,258 --> 01:07:14,894
You don't know. Don't
talk to me anymore.

632
01:07:16,328 --> 01:07:19,197
Cathy, please. Please.

633
01:07:22,334 --> 01:07:23,703
Heathcliff.

634
01:07:23,736 --> 01:07:26,338
You aren't a very nice person

635
01:07:26,371 --> 01:07:28,407
to come here and
communicate this way.

636
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:30,677
Get your hands out
of your pockets.

637
01:07:34,013 --> 01:07:35,280
Okay, then,

638
01:07:36,381 --> 01:07:37,850
it's all right, it's all right.

639
01:07:37,884 --> 01:07:42,587
There's still time.
It doesn't matter.

640
01:07:42,621 --> 01:07:43,923
We can all leave.

641
01:07:45,390 --> 01:07:48,293
Me, you and the child,
we can all leave.

642
01:07:48,326 --> 01:07:50,562
Please, Cathy.

643
01:07:50,595 --> 01:07:53,833
Cathy, Cathy.

644
01:07:53,866 --> 01:07:56,636
No, no, you are too late.

645
01:07:56,669 --> 01:07:57,670
You are my life.

646
01:07:59,538 --> 01:08:00,372
You are my life.

647
01:08:02,374 --> 01:08:03,475
Heathcliff.

648
01:08:08,447 --> 01:08:10,348
Stay with me, please.

649
01:08:12,517 --> 01:08:14,519
I can't, I can't, okay.

650
01:09:30,797 --> 01:09:32,064
Mr. Heathcliff.

651
01:09:32,098 --> 01:09:33,933
Cathy was cruel
to you yesterday.

652
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:38,436
As her friend, I feel the need
to apologize for her conduct.

653
01:09:39,471 --> 01:09:42,909
You needn't apologize. I'm
well aware of Cathy's nature.

654
01:09:44,509 --> 01:09:46,746
Oh, stop sighing, Isabella.

655
01:09:47,847 --> 01:09:49,649
You are harsh and cruel to me.

656
01:09:50,415 --> 01:09:53,019
It's jealousy that
makes her strike out.

657
01:09:54,519 --> 01:09:55,655
Jealousy?

658
01:09:55,688 --> 01:09:59,391
Oh yes, she is quite jealous.

659
01:09:59,424 --> 01:10:00,726
You told me to
ramble where I pleased

660
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:03,062
while you sauntered on
with Mr. Heathcliff.

661
01:10:03,095 --> 01:10:06,565
You wished me away because you
knew I wanted to be with him.

662
01:10:08,634 --> 01:10:11,637
You desire no one to
be loved but yourself.

663
01:10:11,671 --> 01:10:14,707
Cathy can only put on a silk
costume and play the part,

664
01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:16,843
but you, Miss Linton,

665
01:10:18,845 --> 01:10:21,546
are truly a lady.

666
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:24,549
Heathcliff is an
untamed creature,

667
01:10:24,583 --> 01:10:26,518
and it is your powerful
ignorance of his character,

668
01:10:26,551 --> 01:10:31,023
Isabella, and nothing else,
that makes you love him.

669
01:10:31,057 --> 01:10:32,658
A beautiful lady.

670
01:10:35,962 --> 01:10:37,596
Oh, Heathcliff.

671
01:10:39,198 --> 01:10:41,701
We've been quarreling
like cats about you.

672
01:10:41,734 --> 01:10:43,002
Catherine, no.

673
01:10:46,739 --> 01:10:48,573
Mind us, this love I have

674
01:10:48,607 --> 01:10:51,677
is nothing like the love
she entertains for you.

675
01:10:51,711 --> 01:10:54,714
Oh no you don't.

676
01:10:54,747 --> 01:10:56,182
Oh go on then.

677
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:02,621
Sweet Judas.

678
01:11:04,891 --> 01:11:06,058
Who is it, Nelly?

679
01:11:15,067 --> 01:11:17,469
You weren't telling
the truth, were you?

680
01:11:17,502 --> 01:11:18,503
Oh please.

681
01:11:19,571 --> 01:11:22,607
I like her too well to let
you seek to win her over.

682
01:11:22,642 --> 01:11:25,811
And I like her too
little to attempt it.

683
01:11:25,845 --> 01:11:30,850
Then again, she is her
brother's heir, is she not?

684
01:11:51,871 --> 01:11:52,705
Now.

685
01:11:54,807 --> 01:11:55,741
Not much longer.

686
01:12:07,585 --> 01:12:08,955
Wait, no, I...

687
01:12:08,988 --> 01:12:10,056
Heathcliff.

688
01:12:18,130 --> 01:12:20,967
I told you to
leave Isabella alone.

689
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:21,968
What's it to you?

690
01:12:23,568 --> 01:12:25,004
I have every right to
kiss her, if she chooses,

691
01:12:25,037 --> 01:12:26,706
and you have no right to object.

692
01:12:27,572 --> 01:12:28,741
I am not your husband.

693
01:12:32,244 --> 01:12:34,847
If you love Isabella,
then you shall marry her.

694
01:12:36,148 --> 01:12:37,883
But tell me the
truth, Heathcliff,

695
01:12:39,885 --> 01:12:41,220
do you love her?

696
01:12:42,855 --> 01:12:45,157
Thank you for telling me
your sister's little secret.

697
01:12:46,792 --> 01:12:48,560
This way, I'll make
the most of it.

698
01:12:52,698 --> 01:12:54,867
Have you been listening
at the door, Edgar?

699
01:12:58,704 --> 01:12:59,872
I was not ignorant
to your miserable,

700
01:12:59,905 --> 01:13:02,141
degraded character,
Mr. Heathcliff,

701
01:13:02,174 --> 01:13:04,176
but foolishly I acquiesced
to my wife's desire

702
01:13:04,210 --> 01:13:05,778
to keep your acquaintance.

703
01:13:06,812 --> 01:13:09,547
Hereafter, you are no longer
welcome in this household.

704
01:13:10,649 --> 01:13:12,284
I require your
immediate departure.

705
01:13:13,252 --> 01:13:15,021
Nelly, fetch the men.

706
01:13:19,191 --> 01:13:22,094
Cathy, this lamb of yours
threatens like a bull.

707
01:13:23,729 --> 01:13:25,731
By God, Linton, I
am mortally sorry

708
01:13:25,765 --> 01:13:28,067
you are not worth the
trouble of knocking down.

709
01:13:29,802 --> 01:13:31,337
Heathcliff.

710
01:13:46,819 --> 01:13:50,555
I wish you the joy of
this perfect coward, Cathy.

711
01:13:52,224 --> 01:13:53,826
And I compliment you.

712
01:14:11,677 --> 01:14:14,780
Catherine, remain
where you are.

713
01:14:16,816 --> 01:14:18,818
After today's events, do
you intend on continuing

714
01:14:18,851 --> 01:14:20,786
your intimacies
with Mr. Heathcliff?

715
01:14:22,855 --> 01:14:24,824
Leave me alone.

716
01:14:24,857 --> 01:14:27,259
Your cold blood cannot
be worked into a fever.

717
01:14:28,694 --> 01:14:30,896
Your veins are
full of ice water.

718
01:14:30,930 --> 01:14:33,899
Will you be with Heathcliff,
or will you be with me?

719
01:14:35,701 --> 01:14:38,838
You cannot be his
friend and my wife.

720
01:14:38,871 --> 01:14:40,906
I require you to choose.

721
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:41,974
Oh!

722
01:14:42,607 --> 01:14:45,878
I require to be left alone, oh!

723
01:14:48,247 --> 01:14:49,715
Catherine.

724
01:14:58,858 --> 01:15:01,794
I'm going to die,
aren't I, Nelly?

725
01:15:03,896 --> 01:15:04,864
You're not gonna die.

726
01:15:07,867 --> 01:15:10,769
Heathcliff then,
he doesn't love me.

727
01:15:11,704 --> 01:15:12,705
He never missed me.

728
01:15:15,708 --> 01:15:16,976
I'm afraid of being alone.

729
01:15:18,811 --> 01:15:19,778
You're not alone.

730
01:15:21,947 --> 01:15:24,350
Oh, I need him not to wait

731
01:15:24,383 --> 01:15:26,385
and to come straight
down off the moor.

732
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:30,356
Oh, let me have just one breath.

733
01:15:30,389 --> 01:15:31,223
I will not.

734
01:15:32,091 --> 01:15:32,925
No.

735
01:15:40,799 --> 01:15:42,434
Why am I so changed?

736
01:15:44,803 --> 01:15:47,173
In an instant, I was
converted into Miss Linton,

737
01:15:48,741 --> 01:15:50,776
the lady of Thrushcross Grange.

738
01:15:52,178 --> 01:15:53,012
I am

739
01:15:55,948 --> 01:15:59,653
an exile, an outcast
from my world.

740
01:16:06,792 --> 01:16:08,460
I wish I were our dogs.

741
01:16:13,132 --> 01:16:15,401
I wish I were a girl again.

742
01:16:16,902 --> 01:16:18,270
Savage and hardy.

743
01:16:20,206 --> 01:16:21,440
Laughing at miseries.

744
01:16:24,076 --> 01:16:26,245
Not maddening under them.

745
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:31,417
I should be myself if I
were among the heather.

746
01:16:32,451 --> 01:16:34,987
Nelly, let me feel the wind!

747
01:16:36,021 --> 01:16:38,390
No, ma'am, I will not let
you catch your death of cold.

748
01:16:38,424 --> 01:16:39,892
No!

749
01:16:47,833 --> 01:16:49,735
Look, there's my room,

750
01:16:51,237 --> 01:16:52,838
with a candle in the window.

751
01:16:54,106 --> 01:16:56,742
Heathcliff is waiting for me.

752
01:16:59,478 --> 01:17:00,412
Heathcliff.

753
01:17:02,181 --> 01:17:03,449
I dare you now.

754
01:17:04,883 --> 01:17:06,852
Will you venture?

755
01:17:06,885 --> 01:17:09,521
I shall not rest
until you are with me.

756
01:17:11,857 --> 01:17:12,925
I never will.

757
01:17:17,029 --> 01:17:18,030
He's considering.

758
01:17:20,933 --> 01:17:23,535
He'd rather
I come to him.

759
01:17:23,569 --> 01:17:26,171
Nelly, are you
mad? Shut the window.

760
01:17:29,008 --> 01:17:30,009
Catherine.

761
01:17:32,044 --> 01:17:36,015
Edgar, you are one of
those that is ever found

762
01:17:36,048 --> 01:17:37,950
when you're least
wanted.

763
01:17:42,521 --> 01:17:44,356
Am I nothing to you anymore?

764
01:17:45,524 --> 01:17:47,993
Do you love that
wretch Heathcliff?

765
01:17:52,931 --> 01:17:55,267
What you touch at
present, you may have,

766
01:17:55,301 --> 01:17:57,303
but my soul will be that hilltop

767
01:17:57,336 --> 01:17:59,571
before you lay your
hands on me again.

768
01:18:02,574 --> 01:18:04,510
What you had of me is gone.

769
01:18:07,279 --> 01:18:08,981
Her mind wanders, sir.

770
01:18:09,014 --> 01:18:11,583
She's been talking
nonsense all night.

771
01:18:11,617 --> 01:18:12,985
Send for Dr. Kenneth.

772
01:18:14,086 --> 01:18:17,089
We must take precautions so
she doesn't harm herself.

773
01:18:19,558 --> 01:18:20,392
Or the baby.

774
01:18:36,975 --> 01:18:37,609
Isabella?

775
01:19:07,072 --> 01:19:07,906
Sir?

776
01:19:12,144 --> 01:19:14,079
It's from Miss Isabella.

777
01:19:45,377 --> 01:19:46,211
Oh.

778
01:19:48,213 --> 01:19:50,149
So what shall we do?

779
01:19:57,289 --> 01:19:58,557
She left of her own accord.

780
01:20:00,459 --> 01:20:02,361
Who the hell are you?

781
01:20:02,394 --> 01:20:06,498
I was Isabella Linton.
We've met before, sir.

782
01:20:06,532 --> 01:20:09,201
I've just married Heathcliff,
and he brought me here.

783
01:20:14,707 --> 01:20:17,176
Heathcliff married you?

784
01:20:17,209 --> 01:20:19,244
From now on, she is
my sister only by name.

785
01:20:23,315 --> 01:20:24,583
Not because I disown her.

786
01:20:27,553 --> 01:20:29,021
She has disowned me.

787
01:20:30,790 --> 01:20:32,257
Where shall I sleep?

788
01:20:32,991 --> 01:20:35,527
Heathcliff's bedroom
is up the stairs,

789
01:20:35,561 --> 01:20:37,062
second door on the right.

790
01:20:38,798 --> 01:20:43,969
Make sure to bolt the
door, Mrs. Heathcliff.

791
01:20:44,269 --> 01:20:45,103
Why?

792
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:52,311
It's a great tempter to
a desperate man, is it not?

793
01:20:54,279 --> 01:20:57,216
Every night, I try
to open his door.

794
01:20:57,249 --> 01:21:01,620
If once I find it
unlocked, he's done for.

795
01:21:03,756 --> 01:21:06,225
When the time comes,

796
01:21:06,258 --> 01:21:08,761
all the angels in heaven
will not save him.

797
01:21:10,496 --> 01:21:11,798
I'll warn him.

798
01:21:11,831 --> 01:21:15,133
I don't give a damn if you do.

799
01:21:16,168 --> 01:21:21,306
Wuthering Heights will be
mine, his gold will be mine,

800
01:21:22,241 --> 01:21:23,108
and then his blood.

801
01:21:28,146 --> 01:21:30,015
Hell can have your soul.

802
01:22:34,346 --> 01:22:36,816
Nelly, how are
you this afternoon?

803
01:22:36,849 --> 01:22:38,718
I've come to
see Miss Isabella.

804
01:22:38,751 --> 01:22:40,485
Have you a letter for me?

805
01:22:40,519 --> 01:22:42,387
I have nothing.

806
01:22:42,421 --> 01:22:45,424
My master sends his love,
but he refuses to communicate

807
01:22:45,457 --> 01:22:46,826
with this household ever again.

808
01:22:48,293 --> 01:22:49,127
Sorry.

809
01:22:51,163 --> 01:22:52,799
And how is Cathy?

810
01:22:52,832 --> 01:22:56,435
Mrs. Linton gave birth to
a little girl last night.

811
01:22:56,468 --> 01:22:58,537
She'll never be like she was.

812
01:22:58,570 --> 01:22:59,872
Her life was spared.

813
01:22:59,906 --> 01:23:01,306
What will he call her?

814
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:02,307
Catherine.

815
01:23:03,375 --> 01:23:04,711
This young lady
looks sadly worse

816
01:23:04,744 --> 01:23:06,679
for her change of condition.

817
01:23:06,713 --> 01:23:10,215
Someone's love falls far
short in her case, obviously.

818
01:23:11,416 --> 01:23:12,517
I should guess her own.

819
01:23:16,221 --> 01:23:19,424
Under delusion, she pictured
me a hero of romance

820
01:23:19,458 --> 01:23:21,393
and expected
unlimited indulgences

821
01:23:21,426 --> 01:23:23,830
from my chivalrous devotion.

822
01:23:23,863 --> 01:23:26,198
It was a marvelous
effort on her part

823
01:23:26,231 --> 01:23:29,267
to discover that I
did not love her.

824
01:23:29,301 --> 01:23:30,402
I've never in all my life met

825
01:23:30,435 --> 01:23:32,337
with such an abject
thing as she.

826
01:23:33,706 --> 01:23:35,607
She even disgraces
the name of Linton.

827
01:23:37,442 --> 01:23:38,543
Take care, Nelly.

828
01:23:39,478 --> 01:23:43,148
He means to provoke
Edgar past desperation.

829
01:23:44,416 --> 01:23:45,250
I'll die first.

830
01:23:47,452 --> 01:23:49,254
To your pleasure, I can imagine.

831
01:23:50,923 --> 01:23:52,224
Or to see him dead.

832
01:23:53,525 --> 01:23:55,527
Enough with the
providence. Out of my sight!

833
01:23:56,361 --> 01:23:59,431
Nelly, I must see her.

834
01:24:01,266 --> 01:24:02,334
I cannot allow that.

835
01:24:02,367 --> 01:24:03,568
Cathy's delirious.

836
01:24:03,602 --> 01:24:04,971
She slips in and
out of consciousness

837
01:24:05,004 --> 01:24:06,271
and remembers very little.

838
01:24:06,304 --> 01:24:07,539
She must call for me.

839
01:24:08,708 --> 01:24:10,375
You know she has
not forgotten me.

840
01:24:10,409 --> 01:24:12,477
For every thought
she spends on Linton,

841
01:24:12,511 --> 01:24:14,446
she spends a thousand on me.

842
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:17,549
Nelly, am I to fight my way

843
01:24:17,582 --> 01:24:19,484
through Edgar and
all his footmen?

844
01:24:21,386 --> 01:24:22,554
Will you please be the friend

845
01:24:22,587 --> 01:24:25,223
you always have
and let me see her?

846
01:24:26,859 --> 01:24:27,694
Please.

847
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:49,414
Cathy.

848
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:02,294
How can I bear it?

849
01:25:04,964 --> 01:25:08,768
You've broken my heart,
and now you come to me

850
01:25:08,801 --> 01:25:11,738
as if you are the
one to be pitied.

851
01:25:12,739 --> 01:25:15,440
I shall not pity you.

852
01:25:15,474 --> 01:25:16,642
You killed me.

853
01:25:19,946 --> 01:25:22,347
You tell me, how
many years do you

854
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:24,483
plan on living after I'm gone?

855
01:25:26,618 --> 01:25:28,520
While you're
possessed of the devil

856
01:25:28,553 --> 01:25:30,890
and speak to me in the
manner while you are dying,

857
01:25:30,923 --> 01:25:33,059
you know those words
will be bred in my memory

858
01:25:33,092 --> 01:25:34,927
while you are at peace.

859
01:25:34,961 --> 01:25:36,696
I shall not be at peace!

860
01:25:41,566 --> 01:25:43,903
I don't wish to torment you.

861
01:25:48,473 --> 01:25:50,375
Come to me, Heathcliff.

862
01:26:09,561 --> 01:26:12,364
Why did you betray
your own heart, Cathy?

863
01:26:14,133 --> 01:26:15,567
You've killed yourself.

864
01:26:21,073 --> 01:26:21,974
You.

865
01:26:24,609 --> 01:26:25,678
You loved me.

866
01:26:28,681 --> 01:26:31,684
Then what right had
you to leave me?

867
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:37,657
For the poor fancy
you felt for Linton?

868
01:26:38,991 --> 01:26:40,793
This degradation and
misery and death,

869
01:26:40,827 --> 01:26:44,496
nothing God or Satan could
inflict could part us.

870
01:26:44,529 --> 01:26:45,564
You...

871
01:26:47,633 --> 01:26:49,001
You of your own will did.

872
01:26:50,770 --> 01:26:54,606
I have not broken
your heart, Cathy.

873
01:26:56,008 --> 01:26:58,878
You have broken it.

874
01:26:58,911 --> 01:27:02,414
And in breaking it
you have broken mine.

875
01:27:02,447 --> 01:27:04,549
If I've done wrong,
I'm dying for it.

876
01:27:06,484 --> 01:27:07,619
You left me too.

877
01:27:08,988 --> 01:27:10,355
I forgive you.

878
01:27:12,058 --> 01:27:12,959
Forgive me.

879
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:17,697
I love my murderer.
But yours, how can I?

880
01:27:37,717 --> 01:27:39,752
I wish I'd told you.

881
01:27:42,487 --> 01:27:43,555
But I cannot.

882
01:27:46,491 --> 01:27:49,594
My master has
returned. You must leave.

883
01:27:59,071 --> 01:28:00,605
Cathy, I must go.

884
01:28:03,743 --> 01:28:05,778
No, no, you mustn't.

885
01:28:06,646 --> 01:28:07,680
I must.

886
01:28:08,848 --> 01:28:10,950
No, not for a minute.

887
01:28:14,552 --> 01:28:15,955
I must.

888
01:28:15,988 --> 01:28:18,057
No, no, don't leave me.

889
01:28:19,091 --> 01:28:20,693
No, don't leave me.

890
01:28:21,994 --> 01:28:24,664
Heathcliff, if
you stay it will be

891
01:28:24,697 --> 01:28:26,766
your most diabolical deed.

892
01:28:33,605 --> 01:28:35,041
What in God's name?

893
01:28:51,057 --> 01:28:54,559
Unless you be a fiend,
you'll help her first.

894
01:28:54,592 --> 01:28:56,628
Then you shall speak with me.

895
01:29:05,705 --> 01:29:06,504
No!

896
01:29:10,710 --> 01:29:11,543
No!

897
01:29:12,610 --> 01:29:13,713
No!

898
01:29:13,746 --> 01:29:14,680
Heathcliff!

899
01:29:15,848 --> 01:29:16,782
Heathcliff!

900
01:29:16,816 --> 01:29:18,985
What have you done to her?

901
01:29:19,018 --> 01:29:19,852
Catherine!

902
01:29:20,753 --> 01:29:22,888
What have you done to her?

903
01:29:45,344 --> 01:29:48,748
She's dead. I've not
waited for you to learn that.

904
01:29:50,750 --> 01:29:53,618
Don't you snivel
before me, damn you.

905
01:29:53,652 --> 01:29:55,221
She wants none of your tears.

906
01:29:56,055 --> 01:29:57,156
She is at peace now.

907
01:30:00,226 --> 01:30:02,094
Did she die like a saint?

908
01:30:02,128 --> 01:30:05,131
You poor wretch, your
pride can't blind God.

909
01:30:09,902 --> 01:30:10,803
How did she die?

910
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:17,643
Her senses never
returned after you left.

911
01:30:17,676 --> 01:30:19,577
She sank into a sleep.

912
01:30:19,611 --> 01:30:21,579
Her life closed
in a gentle dream.

913
01:30:22,915 --> 01:30:25,617
May she wake as kindly
in the next world.

914
01:30:25,651 --> 01:30:26,886
May she wake in torment.

915
01:30:30,222 --> 01:30:32,992
I pray one prayer,
and I'll repeat it

916
01:30:33,025 --> 01:30:34,559
until my tongue stiffens.

917
01:30:36,295 --> 01:30:41,300
Catherine Earnshaw, may you not
rest as long as I am living.

918
01:30:43,369 --> 01:30:45,137
You say I killed
you. Haunt me then!

919
01:30:48,374 --> 01:30:52,244
Be with me always! Take
any form, drive me mad!

920
01:30:55,181 --> 01:30:56,916
As long as you don't leave me

921
01:30:56,949 --> 01:31:00,853
in this abyss where
I cannot find you.

922
01:31:00,886 --> 01:31:04,356
I cannot live without my life.

923
01:31:04,390 --> 01:31:09,594
I cannot live without my soul!

924
01:31:11,197 --> 01:31:13,766
I cannot live without my life.

925
01:31:13,799 --> 01:31:18,104
I cannot live without
my soul.

926
01:31:30,015 --> 01:31:32,685
I cannot live without my life.

927
01:31:44,763 --> 01:31:45,397
Cathy!

928
01:31:49,768 --> 01:31:50,402
No!

929
01:32:00,479 --> 01:32:01,313
No!

930
01:32:27,406 --> 01:32:29,008
Do you believe such people

931
01:32:29,041 --> 01:32:32,178
are happy in the other
world, Miss Dean?

932
01:32:35,047 --> 01:32:36,982
Retracing the course
of Catherine Linton,

933
01:32:38,117 --> 01:32:40,886
I fear we have no right
to believe she is.

934
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:43,022
But we'll leave that
to her and her maker.

935
01:32:47,459 --> 01:32:49,228
To the surprise of
the whole parish,

936
01:32:49,261 --> 01:32:51,964
Catherine's burial was neither
under the carved monuments

937
01:32:51,997 --> 01:32:55,067
of the Lintons nor by the
tombs of her relations outside.

938
01:32:56,168 --> 01:32:59,972
It was down on a green slope,
in a corner of the churchyard,

939
01:33:00,906 --> 01:33:03,242
where the walls are so
low that the heather

940
01:33:03,275 --> 01:33:06,779
climbs over from the
moors and buries it.

941
01:33:15,020 --> 01:33:17,256
You and I have a great
debt to settle with him.

942
01:33:17,289 --> 01:33:19,225
If neither of us were
cowards, we could combine.

943
01:33:19,258 --> 01:33:20,459
He's leaving me...

944
01:33:20,492 --> 01:33:22,194
Are you as soft
as your brother?

945
01:33:22,228 --> 01:33:23,495
Are you willing to
endure to the last

946
01:33:23,529 --> 01:33:24,997
and not attempt repayment?

947
01:33:25,030 --> 01:33:26,498
I'm weary of enduring.

948
01:33:26,532 --> 01:33:29,001
He will be my ruin, and
you and your child's death,

949
01:33:29,034 --> 01:33:31,170
not unless we get him first!

950
01:33:31,203 --> 01:33:32,238
No, you mustn't hurt him.

951
01:33:38,978 --> 01:33:40,913
No, Heathcliff, stop!

952
01:33:40,946 --> 01:33:43,549
No, get off him. You
might kill him, stop it!

953
01:33:43,582 --> 01:33:45,918
I couldn't kill him

954
01:33:45,951 --> 01:33:47,319
Heathcliff, stop!

955
01:33:47,353 --> 01:33:49,021
Let him go. Stop it!

956
01:33:56,862 --> 01:33:59,398
I believe our
father gave me this.

957
01:34:05,537 --> 01:34:09,942
If God gave me the
strength to strangle you,

958
01:34:09,975 --> 01:34:11,944
I'd go to hell with joy.

959
01:34:14,913 --> 01:34:18,183
Isn't it enough you've
already murdered his sister?

960
01:34:18,217 --> 01:34:21,153
Everybody knows she'd still be
living if it weren't for you.

961
01:34:22,855 --> 01:34:25,024
So why don't you go
lay over her grave

962
01:34:25,057 --> 01:34:27,293
like an old, faithful dog?

963
01:34:27,326 --> 01:34:30,496
Surely the world isn't
worth living in now, is it?

964
01:34:54,186 --> 01:34:56,055
Heathcliff.

965
01:35:13,572 --> 01:35:15,007
Here you are.

966
01:35:19,178 --> 01:35:20,412
Drink up.

967
01:35:34,193 --> 01:35:37,129
Your brother
barely knew her too.

968
01:35:39,965 --> 01:35:41,166
You clean him up.

969
01:35:59,118 --> 01:36:01,019
Isabella, what
has happened to you?

970
01:36:01,053 --> 01:36:03,021
Hindley is dead.

971
01:36:03,055 --> 01:36:05,991
He fought Heathcliff true
to form, drunk as a lord,

972
01:36:06,024 --> 01:36:08,193
and Heathcliff fought back.

973
01:36:08,227 --> 01:36:10,229
I cannot live another
day with that villain.

974
01:36:11,196 --> 01:36:13,432
I'm leaving for London,
and I've just come by

975
01:36:13,465 --> 01:36:15,467
to see you and the
baby before I depart.

976
01:36:30,416 --> 01:36:32,251
If my brother asks,

977
01:36:32,284 --> 01:36:34,953
I permit you to tell
him where I've gone.

978
01:36:34,987 --> 01:36:38,056
But do not tell Mr.
Heathcliff, will you promise?

979
01:36:38,090 --> 01:36:38,957
I promise.

980
01:36:41,126 --> 01:36:43,195
Give my love to my brother.

981
01:36:43,228 --> 01:36:44,129
I'll write to you.

982
01:36:47,099 --> 01:36:48,033
Godspeed.

983
01:37:01,681 --> 01:37:04,550
Now, my bonny lad,
let's see if one tree

984
01:37:04,583 --> 01:37:06,485
won't grow as crooked as another

985
01:37:07,152 --> 01:37:09,188
with the same wind to twist it.

986
01:37:31,410 --> 01:37:34,279
Hareton, who should
now be the first gentleman

987
01:37:34,313 --> 01:37:37,082
in the neighborhood,
was reduced to a state

988
01:37:37,115 --> 01:37:40,219
of complete dependence on
his father's inveterate enemy

989
01:37:41,019 --> 01:37:43,055
and lives in his own
house as a servant.

990
01:38:12,317 --> 01:38:16,188
The next 15 years, following
that dismal period,

991
01:38:16,221 --> 01:38:18,190
were the happiest of my life.

992
01:38:19,525 --> 01:38:22,060
Little Catherine
grew like a larch.

993
01:38:22,094 --> 01:38:25,130
She was light and
fair like the Lintons,

994
01:38:25,163 --> 01:38:27,232
but with the handsome
eyes of her mother.

995
01:38:29,234 --> 01:38:30,035
Good morning, Papa.

996
01:38:30,068 --> 01:38:32,437
Good morning,
Catherine, Nelly.

997
01:38:32,471 --> 01:38:34,206
Morning, sir.

998
01:38:38,878 --> 01:38:42,314
She had not been
beyond the grange by herself.

999
01:38:42,347 --> 01:38:47,352
Wuthering Heights, and
Heathcliff, did not exist for her.

1000
01:38:52,624 --> 01:38:53,826
Oh.

1001
01:38:53,860 --> 01:38:55,862
Something wrong,
Miss Catherine?

1002
01:38:55,895 --> 01:38:59,364
Oh, no, I've just
a slight headache.

1003
01:38:59,398 --> 01:39:01,300
Would you like some tea?

1004
01:39:01,333 --> 01:39:03,402
Oh no, no. I'll just rest.

1005
01:39:36,669 --> 01:39:37,670
Catherine?

1006
01:39:40,539 --> 01:39:41,373
Catherine?

1007
01:39:45,477 --> 01:39:46,311
Sir?

1008
01:39:49,281 --> 01:39:50,115
Sir.

1009
01:39:55,253 --> 01:39:57,356
I'm afraid I'm quite lost.

1010
01:39:57,389 --> 01:39:59,826
Do you know where Thrushcross
Grange is from here?

1011
01:39:59,859 --> 01:40:02,762
You're Edgar Linton's
daughter, aren't you?

1012
01:40:04,429 --> 01:40:06,598
Yes, I am. Do
you know my father?

1013
01:40:07,867 --> 01:40:09,468
So to speak.

1014
01:40:09,501 --> 01:40:11,603
My name is Catherine.
What's yours?

1015
01:40:12,805 --> 01:40:13,640
Hareton.

1016
01:40:15,340 --> 01:40:17,342
I'm pleased to make
your acquaintance.

1017
01:40:18,778 --> 01:40:22,481
I'm afraid it's going to rain.
Do you live far from here?

1018
01:40:38,998 --> 01:40:40,232
Miss Catherine?

1019
01:40:44,269 --> 01:40:46,673
If your father had any notion
of you being at this house,

1020
01:40:46,706 --> 01:40:49,274
you'd be glad enough to get out.

1021
01:40:49,307 --> 01:40:51,978
It's your father's,
isn't it, Hareton?

1022
01:40:52,011 --> 01:40:52,845
No.

1023
01:40:55,414 --> 01:40:57,349
I thought you had
been the owner's son.

1024
01:40:57,382 --> 01:40:59,418
Are you a servant?

1025
01:40:59,451 --> 01:41:02,387
I'll see you damned
before I'd be your servant.

1026
01:41:02,421 --> 01:41:03,890
You'll see me what?

1027
01:41:03,923 --> 01:41:04,757
Damned.

1028
01:41:06,425 --> 01:41:08,427
How dare you speak
to me that way?

1029
01:41:09,628 --> 01:41:11,596
I'll tell my father
what you said.

1030
01:41:11,630 --> 01:41:14,599
Miss Catherine here knows
nothing about being civil.

1031
01:41:14,634 --> 01:41:18,537
Although Hareton's not your
master's son, he's your cousin.

1032
01:41:19,571 --> 01:41:20,807
My cousin?

1033
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:21,874
Mm-hm.

1034
01:41:21,908 --> 01:41:24,777
Nelly, you must be mistaken.

1035
01:41:24,811 --> 01:41:27,914
My father has just gone to
fetch my cousin from London.

1036
01:41:27,947 --> 01:41:29,782
A gentleman's son.

1037
01:41:31,283 --> 01:41:32,484
People can have many
cousins of all sorts

1038
01:41:32,517 --> 01:41:34,286
without being the worse for it.

1039
01:41:35,888 --> 01:41:36,989
Miss Catherine.

1040
01:41:47,566 --> 01:41:50,335
Promise me you'll
look after him, Nelly.

1041
01:41:50,368 --> 01:41:52,638
You'll love him like your own.

1042
01:41:55,007 --> 01:41:55,842
Hareton.

1043
01:41:58,443 --> 01:41:59,679
We'll not
tell your father

1044
01:41:59,712 --> 01:42:01,346
that you went to
Wuthering Heights.

1045
01:42:02,514 --> 01:42:04,583
I cannot
understand why not.

1046
01:42:04,616 --> 01:42:05,517
Before your father departed,

1047
01:42:05,550 --> 01:42:07,653
did he or did he not
tell you to mind me?

1048
01:42:09,822 --> 01:42:13,391
Well, since you've deceived me
in your counterfeit sickness

1049
01:42:13,425 --> 01:42:16,963
to break your father's one
rule, perhaps you could repay me

1050
01:42:16,996 --> 01:42:19,431
by not telling him I
failed as your guardian.

1051
01:42:21,533 --> 01:42:22,835
I shan't whisper a word.

1052
01:42:26,773 --> 01:42:28,406
A letter
announced the day

1053
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:31,543
of my master Edgar
Linton's return.

1054
01:42:31,576 --> 01:42:32,377
Catherine.

1055
01:42:32,410 --> 01:42:33,045
Papa.

1056
01:42:34,781 --> 01:42:37,049
Now, Catherine, your
cousin Linton is not

1057
01:42:37,083 --> 01:42:39,351
as strong or as
merry as you are.

1058
01:42:40,519 --> 01:42:41,754
He's just recently
lost his mother.

1059
01:42:41,788 --> 01:42:43,723
Isabella was dead.

1060
01:42:43,756 --> 01:42:46,726
Just don't expect him to
play and run about just yet.

1061
01:42:46,759 --> 01:42:48,627
And he
wrote to bid me get

1062
01:42:48,661 --> 01:42:50,362
mourning for his daughter.

1063
01:42:50,395 --> 01:42:51,030
Linton.

1064
01:42:53,633 --> 01:42:54,901
This is your cousin Catherine.

1065
01:42:55,935 --> 01:42:57,670
She's very fond of you already.

1066
01:42:58,704 --> 01:43:01,473
And arrange a room
and other accommodations

1067
01:43:01,506 --> 01:43:03,009
for his youthful nephew.

1068
01:43:04,543 --> 01:43:05,711
May I go to bed, Uncle.

1069
01:43:07,046 --> 01:43:09,347
A pale,
delicate, effeminate boy.

1070
01:43:10,582 --> 01:43:11,616
Nelly.

1071
01:43:25,630 --> 01:43:27,532
Good evening, Heathcliff.

1072
01:43:27,566 --> 01:43:29,936
What business brings
you here tonight?

1073
01:43:29,969 --> 01:43:31,637
I am here to see my son.

1074
01:43:32,805 --> 01:43:34,106
Master Linton has gone to bed

1075
01:43:34,140 --> 01:43:36,441
along with the rest
of the household.

1076
01:43:36,474 --> 01:43:38,510
And unless you have
something particular to say,

1077
01:43:38,543 --> 01:43:40,112
you may entrust
your message to me.

1078
01:43:40,980 --> 01:43:41,948
Who is it, Nelly?

1079
01:43:44,817 --> 01:43:46,719
I
have come for my son.

1080
01:43:47,887 --> 01:43:49,956
He may be your son,

1081
01:43:49,989 --> 01:43:52,859
but his mother desires
him to remain in my care.

1082
01:43:52,892 --> 01:43:55,460
His mother is dead.

1083
01:43:56,595 --> 01:43:58,030
How did you come to know that?

1084
01:43:58,064 --> 01:43:59,899
How I know is of no matter.

1085
01:44:01,533 --> 01:44:03,970
Surely as a magistrate
you will not keep a father

1086
01:44:04,003 --> 01:44:05,905
from caring for his only child.

1087
01:44:09,175 --> 01:44:10,943
Nelly will accompany Linton

1088
01:44:10,977 --> 01:44:13,578
to Wuthering Heights
in the morning.

1089
01:44:13,612 --> 01:44:14,814
He has just come
from a long journey,

1090
01:44:14,847 --> 01:44:16,816
and his health is
very precarious.

1091
01:44:18,217 --> 01:44:20,887
If you care for him at all,
which, with much regret

1092
01:44:20,920 --> 01:44:24,824
I doubt you do, you'll let
him sleep through the night.

1093
01:44:26,625 --> 01:44:27,760
Very well.

1094
01:44:31,030 --> 01:44:33,766
I look forward to seeing
you in the morning, Nelly.

1095
01:44:36,235 --> 01:44:37,069
Good evening.

1096
01:44:48,781 --> 01:44:49,815
Mr. Linton
commissioned me

1097
01:44:49,849 --> 01:44:51,483
to take the boy home early.

1098
01:44:52,517 --> 01:44:54,820
He was very reluctant
to be roused

1099
01:44:54,854 --> 01:44:58,623
from his bed at five o'clock,
and astonished to be informed

1100
01:44:58,658 --> 01:45:00,793
that he must prepare
for further traveling.

1101
01:45:02,261 --> 01:45:05,031
But I softened up the matter
by stating that he was going

1102
01:45:05,064 --> 01:45:09,669
to spend some time with
his father, Mr. Heathcliff,

1103
01:45:09,702 --> 01:45:12,570
who wished to see him very much.

1104
01:45:17,509 --> 01:45:20,713
It is truly worse
than I expected.

1105
01:45:20,746 --> 01:45:21,847
You are your mother's son.

1106
01:45:29,021 --> 01:45:29,922
Do you know me?

1107
01:45:29,956 --> 01:45:30,790
No.

1108
01:45:32,725 --> 01:45:34,760
You've heard of
me, I dare say.

1109
01:45:34,794 --> 01:45:35,895
No.

1110
01:45:35,928 --> 01:45:39,799
Hm, your mother was wicked
to leave you in ignorance

1111
01:45:39,832 --> 01:45:41,767
of the sort of
father you possessed.

1112
01:45:41,801 --> 01:45:45,004
I hope you'll be kind
to your son, Heathcliff.

1113
01:45:45,037 --> 01:45:47,773
He's the only kin in the
world you'll ever know.

1114
01:45:47,807 --> 01:45:48,908
Remember that.

1115
01:45:48,941 --> 01:45:52,011
I will be very kind to
him, Nelly, you needn't fear.

1116
01:45:52,044 --> 01:45:53,946
After all, my son is
the prospective owner

1117
01:45:53,980 --> 01:45:55,214
of Thrushcross Grange.

1118
01:45:55,247 --> 01:45:57,216
I shall not wish him
to die until I was

1119
01:45:57,249 --> 01:45:59,785
certain of being his successor.

1120
01:45:59,819 --> 01:46:02,755
That is the sole consideration
which I can endear, wealth.

1121
01:46:02,788 --> 01:46:04,757
Brought this for young Linton.

1122
01:46:04,790 --> 01:46:06,759
He won't need that.

1123
01:46:06,792 --> 01:46:09,829
Hm, the dainty chap
says he cannot eat it.

1124
01:46:09,862 --> 01:46:13,232
His mother was just the
same, just as hard to please.

1125
01:46:13,265 --> 01:46:15,868
Don't mention his
mother to me again,

1126
01:46:16,902 --> 01:46:18,804
and get him
something he can eat.

1127
01:46:21,606 --> 01:46:25,778
See, Nelly, all is fine.

1128
01:46:25,811 --> 01:46:26,712
Have a good afternoon.

1129
01:46:27,847 --> 01:46:30,716
On a beautiful
spring day, my young lady asked

1130
01:46:30,750 --> 01:46:32,584
to have a ramble on
the moor with me.

1131
01:46:32,617 --> 01:46:35,553
She was off like
a young greyhound.

1132
01:46:35,587 --> 01:46:36,689
Young lady.

1133
01:46:36,722 --> 01:46:38,758
And as I
toiled to follow,

1134
01:46:38,791 --> 01:46:42,962
she came upon Mr. Heathcliff.

1135
01:46:42,995 --> 01:46:44,663
I hope it's still my father's.

1136
01:46:44,697 --> 01:46:46,699
And who is your father?

1137
01:46:46,732 --> 01:46:50,836
Edgar Linton, owner
of Thrushcross Grange.

1138
01:46:50,870 --> 01:46:52,271
Do you know him?

1139
01:46:56,242 --> 01:46:57,076
Very well.

1140
01:46:58,744 --> 01:46:59,779
Miss Catherine?

1141
01:47:00,780 --> 01:47:02,181
Miss Catherine.

1142
01:47:07,619 --> 01:47:08,687
Is he your son?

1143
01:47:10,756 --> 01:47:14,760
No, but I do have one.

1144
01:47:14,794 --> 01:47:15,895
And you've met him before.

1145
01:47:17,629 --> 01:47:18,931
My house is just over the hill.

1146
01:47:18,964 --> 01:47:20,866
Perhaps you would
like to come to tea.

1147
01:47:23,202 --> 01:47:25,905
Catherine, you are to
come with me at once.

1148
01:47:25,938 --> 01:47:27,373
I will not.

1149
01:47:27,406 --> 01:47:29,041
This man has just
invited me to tea

1150
01:47:29,075 --> 01:47:30,943
and said that I know his son.

1151
01:47:31,911 --> 01:47:34,780
I'm sure he's mistaken,
but what an adventure.

1152
01:47:36,816 --> 01:47:38,818
Heathcliff, my master
will hate me if he found out

1153
01:47:38,851 --> 01:47:40,653
I allowed her to
enter your house.

1154
01:47:40,686 --> 01:47:43,289
I will be blamed for your
devious design and discharged.

1155
01:47:45,291 --> 01:47:48,027
My design is as
honest as possible.

1156
01:47:48,060 --> 01:47:51,330
I wish for the two cousins
to fall in love and marry.

1157
01:47:51,363 --> 01:47:54,767
And you needn't worry about
your job at the Grange.

1158
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:57,269
There's always a position
for you at Wuthering Heights.

1159
01:48:03,242 --> 01:48:05,010
Oh, it's so lovely.

1160
01:48:08,347 --> 01:48:10,416
Now, do you know who that is?

1161
01:48:10,449 --> 01:48:11,283
Your son?

1162
01:48:12,885 --> 01:48:14,353
Linton, it's Linton!

1163
01:48:15,287 --> 01:48:17,923
Oh, you have very much changed.

1164
01:48:18,891 --> 01:48:20,960
And you must be my uncle then!

1165
01:48:22,895 --> 01:48:25,931
Why don't you come and visit
us at the Grange with Linton?

1166
01:48:25,965 --> 01:48:27,933
To think, all these years
such close neighbors

1167
01:48:27,967 --> 01:48:28,868
and to never visit us.

1168
01:48:32,071 --> 01:48:34,840
I visited once or twice
before you were born.

1169
01:48:36,942 --> 01:48:40,112
But your father and I quarreled
at one time in our lives.

1170
01:48:42,781 --> 01:48:43,949
Why did you quarrel?

1171
01:48:43,983 --> 01:48:47,820
He felt me too poor
to marry your sister,

1172
01:48:48,754 --> 01:48:52,758
and was grieved to learn
that I had won her.

1173
01:48:52,791 --> 01:48:56,262
His pride was hurt, and
he had never forgiven it.

1174
01:49:00,866 --> 01:49:04,870
Well Linton and I have
no share in your quarrel.

1175
01:49:04,904 --> 01:49:06,272
If Papa will not
let me come here,

1176
01:49:06,305 --> 01:49:09,008
then Linton must
come to the Grange.

1177
01:49:09,041 --> 01:49:10,910
To walk four
miles would kill me.

1178
01:49:10,943 --> 01:49:12,912
Please, come here,
Miss Catherine.

1179
01:49:12,945 --> 01:49:15,381
Not every morning but
once or twice a week.

1180
01:49:15,414 --> 01:49:18,050
Linton, have you nothing
to show your cousin?

1181
01:49:19,251 --> 01:49:20,920
Take her to the garden.

1182
01:49:20,953 --> 01:49:21,987
Oh, that sounds lovely.

1183
01:49:22,021 --> 01:49:23,657
Wouldn't you rather sit here?

1184
01:49:25,057 --> 01:49:26,725
If
that's what you prefer.

1185
01:49:26,759 --> 01:49:28,761
I'll take you to the garden.

1186
01:49:34,433 --> 01:49:35,267
Very well.

1187
01:49:36,902 --> 01:49:38,871
Behave like a
gentleman, mind you.

1188
01:49:39,705 --> 01:49:41,907
And take your hands
out of your pockets.

1189
01:49:53,018 --> 01:49:55,087
Get up, you interloper.

1190
01:49:56,555 --> 01:49:59,158
Now you've got a rival for
your cousin's affections.

1191
01:50:02,494 --> 01:50:04,029
What does that name mean?

1192
01:50:04,930 --> 01:50:06,232
Some damnable writing.

1193
01:50:08,033 --> 01:50:08,901
I can't read it.

1194
01:50:10,035 --> 01:50:11,103
I can read.

1195
01:50:12,171 --> 01:50:13,339
I want to know why it's there.

1196
01:50:13,372 --> 01:50:15,741
He does not know
his letters.

1197
01:50:16,909 --> 01:50:19,945
Could you believe in the existence
of such a colossal dunce?

1198
01:50:19,979 --> 01:50:22,014
Has anyone attempted
to teach him?

1199
01:50:25,484 --> 01:50:27,019
Or is he simple?

1200
01:50:27,052 --> 01:50:29,388
Please, there is nothing
the matter but laziness.

1201
01:50:29,421 --> 01:50:31,156
Is there, Earnshaw?

1202
01:50:31,190 --> 01:50:34,994
My cousin fancies you,
an idiot, Earnshaw.

1203
01:50:40,332 --> 01:50:42,935
If you weren't more
a lass than a lad,

1204
01:50:42,968 --> 01:50:44,436
I'd fell you this minute.

1205
01:50:46,238 --> 01:50:49,975
Nelly, you recollect
me at this age.

1206
01:50:50,009 --> 01:50:51,977
Did I ever look so stupid?

1207
01:50:52,011 --> 01:50:54,913
Worse, because you
were more sullen.

1208
01:50:57,883 --> 01:50:59,184
I would have
loved the lad had he been

1209
01:50:59,218 --> 01:51:02,888
someone else's, but I am sure
he is safe from her love.

1210
01:51:06,992 --> 01:51:09,895
Hindley would have been proud
of his son, wouldn't he?

1211
01:51:19,004 --> 01:51:21,473
Almost as proud as I am of mine.

1212
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:38,090
Oh, Papa, I saw
Linton the other day,

1213
01:51:38,123 --> 01:51:39,558
at Wuthering Heights.

1214
01:51:40,459 --> 01:51:42,127
I met my uncle, too.

1215
01:51:43,495 --> 01:51:45,998
Why didn't you tell me
that Linton was nearby?

1216
01:51:50,903 --> 01:51:53,138
Catherine, you know why I kept

1217
01:51:53,172 --> 01:51:55,240
Linton's residence from you.

1218
01:51:57,142 --> 01:52:00,045
Is it because you
dislike Mr. Heathcliff?

1219
01:52:00,979 --> 01:52:05,317
No, not because I
dislike Mr. Heathcliff.

1220
01:52:06,518 --> 01:52:09,355
It's because Mr.
Heathcliff dislikes me.

1221
01:52:09,388 --> 01:52:12,391
Catherine, you
must listen to me.

1222
01:52:12,424 --> 01:52:15,994
He is the most diabolical
man, looking to wrong and ruin

1223
01:52:16,028 --> 01:52:18,297
those he hates given the
slightest opportunity.

1224
01:52:19,699 --> 01:52:22,000
I knew that you could not
keep acquaintance with Linton

1225
01:52:22,034 --> 01:52:24,570
without coming into contact
with Mr. Heathcliff.

1226
01:52:24,603 --> 01:52:28,006
But Mr. Heathcliff
was very cordial, Papa.

1227
01:52:28,040 --> 01:52:30,209
He didn't object to Linton
and I seeing each other.

1228
01:52:30,242 --> 01:52:32,611
But I do object, Catherine.

1229
01:52:32,645 --> 01:52:34,947
My reasons you would
not understand.

1230
01:52:34,980 --> 01:52:38,217
You mother may still be
alive if it were not for him.

1231
01:52:38,250 --> 01:52:40,219
I will not see the
last person I love

1232
01:52:40,252 --> 01:52:42,221
in this world
suffer at his hand.

1233
01:52:48,627 --> 01:52:52,297
You are to stay away
from Wuthering Heights.

1234
01:53:01,273 --> 01:53:02,908
Dearest Catherine,

1235
01:53:07,246 --> 01:53:09,649
ever since I last
looked on to your face,

1236
01:53:09,682 --> 01:53:12,484
I have been able to
think of little else.

1237
01:53:15,120 --> 01:53:17,956
I would gladly think
of nothing else.

1238
01:53:21,293 --> 01:53:25,564
However, my memory
cannot compare

1239
01:53:27,767 --> 01:53:29,201
to your true form.

1240
01:53:38,277 --> 01:53:41,980
I am still not well enough to
make the trek to the Grange.

1241
01:53:43,382 --> 01:53:46,118
To understand this
world, to keep one's faith

1242
01:53:46,151 --> 01:53:49,221
in its deep meaning, to
reconcile the existence

1243
01:53:49,254 --> 01:53:51,123
of God to the existence of evil.

1244
01:53:51,156 --> 01:53:52,692
How should we picture heaven?

1245
01:53:58,096 --> 01:53:59,766
You
must find a way to defy

1246
01:53:59,799 --> 01:54:03,402
Uncle Edgar and see me
here, at the Heights.

1247
01:54:07,239 --> 01:54:08,073
How long have you been going

1248
01:54:08,106 --> 01:54:10,275
to Wuthering Heights,
Miss Catherine?

1249
01:54:10,309 --> 01:54:14,379
In a rustling green tree,
with bright white clouds,

1250
01:54:14,413 --> 01:54:19,151
and birds of all sorts
pouring music in at all sides.

1251
01:54:24,556 --> 01:54:26,759
Only a little while.

1252
01:54:26,793 --> 01:54:29,696
And it's only because Linton
is too ill to travel here.

1253
01:54:29,729 --> 01:54:31,497
You should not
be risking so much

1254
01:54:31,530 --> 01:54:33,666
to simply visit
with your cousin.

1255
01:54:33,700 --> 01:54:35,400
Nelly, I love him.

1256
01:54:35,434 --> 01:54:37,236
How should you picture heaven?

1257
01:54:38,470 --> 01:54:41,206
This, warm by
the fire, with you.

1258
01:54:43,408 --> 01:54:47,079
You've seen Linton but a
handful of times in your life.

1259
01:54:47,112 --> 01:54:48,514
He has the worst bit of
sickly slip that ever

1260
01:54:48,547 --> 01:54:51,083
struggled into his teens,
and I'm glad you have

1261
01:54:51,116 --> 01:54:52,819
no chance of having
him for a husband.

1262
01:54:52,852 --> 01:54:55,153
I will see him again.

1263
01:54:55,187 --> 01:54:56,021
If I had my
father's permission,

1264
01:54:56,054 --> 01:54:58,524
I'd spend half of
my time with you.

1265
01:54:58,557 --> 01:55:00,626
After Papa, I love you
better than anyone.

1266
01:55:01,293 --> 01:55:02,695
You'd love me better than him

1267
01:55:02,729 --> 01:55:04,596
and all the world,
if you were my wife.

1268
01:55:08,333 --> 01:55:09,501
What are you laughing at?

1269
01:55:12,204 --> 01:55:13,806
People often hate their wives.

1270
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:15,340
You are false.

1271
01:55:15,374 --> 01:55:17,342
Your father hated his wife.

1272
01:55:17,376 --> 01:55:18,678
Why do you say such a thing?

1273
01:55:18,711 --> 01:55:22,114
Your mother hated your
father, and loved his.

1274
01:55:22,147 --> 01:55:23,315
You liar!

1275
01:55:24,283 --> 01:55:25,818
You cruel-hearted fiend.

1276
01:55:26,853 --> 01:55:29,388
I will not remain another
moment in your company.

1277
01:55:29,421 --> 01:55:30,322
No, no.

1278
01:55:30,355 --> 01:55:32,224
Catherine, please don't leave.

1279
01:55:32,257 --> 01:55:33,760
You will come back, won't you?

1280
01:55:36,328 --> 01:55:38,363
Only if he's not here.

1281
01:55:46,171 --> 01:55:48,407
Your father's getting
worse by the day.

1282
01:55:51,711 --> 01:55:54,546
If he knew about your trysts,
it probably would kill him.

1283
01:55:58,851 --> 01:56:02,621
Stop this for his sake,
if not for your own.

1284
01:56:06,558 --> 01:56:08,828
With all my love, Linton.

1285
01:56:26,779 --> 01:56:31,316
Oh, Linton, I'm so sorry it
took me so long to get here.

1286
01:56:31,350 --> 01:56:33,218
I had to read my
father to sleep.

1287
01:56:34,419 --> 01:56:35,520
Good evening, Catherine.

1288
01:56:37,589 --> 01:56:39,524
It's been so long
since you've graced

1289
01:56:39,558 --> 01:56:41,159
my house with your presence.

1290
01:56:44,864 --> 01:56:46,365
My father is very ill.

1291
01:56:48,300 --> 01:56:50,268
The rumor goes he
is on his deathbed.

1292
01:56:51,403 --> 01:56:52,404
Is that an exaggeration?

1293
01:56:54,206 --> 01:56:55,140
I'm afraid not.

1294
01:56:57,509 --> 01:56:59,879
Well perhaps I can
console you with a gift.

1295
01:57:01,413 --> 01:57:02,682
I give you what I have.

1296
01:57:03,582 --> 01:57:04,884
It is hardly worth accepting,

1297
01:57:04,917 --> 01:57:07,285
but all that I have
to give you is my son.

1298
01:57:08,520 --> 01:57:09,956
What?

1299
01:57:09,989 --> 01:57:11,791
Father wants us to be married.

1300
01:57:11,824 --> 01:57:13,358
He knows Uncle Edgar
will not approve,

1301
01:57:13,392 --> 01:57:15,394
but he is wary of my dying.

1302
01:57:16,328 --> 01:57:19,431
Thus, we have to be
married in the morning,

1303
01:57:19,464 --> 01:57:21,433
and you can return to the
Grange in the morning.

1304
01:57:24,737 --> 01:57:26,605
I'm not afraid of you.

1305
01:57:26,639 --> 01:57:27,907
Give me the key.

1306
01:57:27,940 --> 01:57:29,441
Oh, you're not afraid of me.

1307
01:57:30,643 --> 01:57:32,577
Your courage is well disguised.

1308
01:57:42,587 --> 01:57:44,489
I'm afraid now,
because if I stay here

1309
01:57:44,523 --> 01:57:46,358
my father will be miserable.

1310
01:57:47,559 --> 01:57:49,696
Please, let me go home.

1311
01:57:49,729 --> 01:57:52,965
I promise to marry your son
tomorrow if you let me go now.

1312
01:57:53,866 --> 01:57:56,468
I'll make sure you'll
keep your promise.

1313
01:57:56,501 --> 01:57:59,304
You will not leave this
house till I am your father.

1314
01:58:00,539 --> 01:58:03,275
The only father that you
will have in a few days.

1315
01:58:04,977 --> 01:58:07,579
At least send word to let
my father know I'm safe.

1316
01:58:09,782 --> 01:58:12,719
His happiest days were
over when yours began.

1317
01:58:14,787 --> 01:58:17,556
He cursed the day you
came into this world.

1318
01:58:21,426 --> 01:58:22,594
I did at least.

1319
01:58:27,767 --> 01:58:30,435
Heathcliff, you
are a cruel man,

1320
01:58:30,469 --> 01:58:31,671
but you are not a fiend.

1321
01:58:32,905 --> 01:58:34,674
If Father were to die
before I returned,

1322
01:58:34,707 --> 01:58:36,843
how could I bear to
live with myself?

1323
01:58:38,610 --> 01:58:41,480
I'm going to kneel here
until you look at me.

1324
01:58:42,982 --> 01:58:43,950
Please.

1325
01:58:45,084 --> 01:58:48,988
Have you never loved anybody
in all your life, Uncle?

1326
01:58:50,522 --> 01:58:51,323
Ever?

1327
01:59:04,804 --> 01:59:07,405
Get your fingers off of me.

1328
01:59:10,342 --> 01:59:11,443
I detest you.

1329
01:59:47,113 --> 01:59:50,883
Hareton, please, tell
my father where I am.

1330
01:59:53,552 --> 01:59:54,352
Please?

1331
02:00:44,136 --> 02:00:44,971
Father.

1332
02:00:49,842 --> 02:00:50,810
Catherine.

1333
02:00:53,511 --> 02:00:55,547
Where have you been?

1334
02:00:55,580 --> 02:00:56,949
Out on the moors.

1335
02:00:58,885 --> 02:01:00,485
But I'm here now.

1336
02:01:02,554 --> 02:01:03,388
I'm here.

1337
02:01:09,061 --> 02:01:11,529
Well I can go to her now.

1338
02:01:17,637 --> 02:01:18,536
I love you.

1339
02:02:12,692 --> 02:02:15,895
I've come to fetch you home
to Wuthering Heights now.

1340
02:02:23,035 --> 02:02:25,004
Her father just died.

1341
02:02:25,037 --> 02:02:26,772
Is there no end to your cruelty?

1342
02:02:27,707 --> 02:02:30,508
I am seeking a tenant
now for this house,

1343
02:02:31,644 --> 02:02:33,846
and I want my children about me.

1344
02:02:42,755 --> 02:02:44,123
I can give you till morning.

1345
02:02:45,791 --> 02:02:47,760
Heathcliff, no.

1346
02:02:47,793 --> 02:02:49,128
I'll go, Nelly.

1347
02:02:54,667 --> 02:02:58,704
Linton is all I have to
love in the world now.

1348
02:02:58,738 --> 02:03:01,140
I know he has a simple nature,

1349
02:03:01,173 --> 02:03:05,978
but I know he loves me, and
for that reason I love him.

1350
02:03:28,834 --> 02:03:33,139
Mr. Heathcliff, you
have nobody to love you,

1351
02:03:34,373 --> 02:03:38,610
and however miserable you make
us, we will have the revenge

1352
02:03:38,644 --> 02:03:41,981
of knowing that cruelty
arises from your great misery.

1353
02:03:50,156 --> 02:03:52,191
Heathcliff.

1354
02:04:40,840 --> 02:04:42,174
Linton is dead.

1355
02:04:48,881 --> 02:04:50,783
How do you feel?

1356
02:04:50,816 --> 02:04:54,386
He's safe, and I'm free.

1357
02:04:56,822 --> 02:05:00,059
I should feel glad, but you
have left me so long to struggle

1358
02:05:00,092 --> 02:05:05,030
against death alone, now
I feel and see only death.

1359
02:05:13,739 --> 02:05:15,875
Here is Linton's will.

1360
02:05:15,908 --> 02:05:18,744
As you can see, he has
bequeathed all that was his

1361
02:05:18,777 --> 02:05:20,980
and all that had
been yours to me.

1362
02:05:22,314 --> 02:05:24,083
The Grange is mine.

1363
02:05:47,940 --> 02:05:49,942
Catherine stayed
in bed a fortnight.

1364
02:05:51,777 --> 02:05:54,246
When Mr. Heathcliff was
unsuccessful at finding a tenant

1365
02:05:54,280 --> 02:05:57,249
for the Grange, I offered my
services at Wuthering Heights.

1366
02:05:58,984 --> 02:06:01,887
Not even that would stir
my mistress from her bed.

1367
02:06:04,356 --> 02:06:05,891
And that brings us to now.

1368
02:06:12,031 --> 02:06:13,999
It is a remarkable tale.

1369
02:06:16,035 --> 02:06:17,036
I shall never forget it.

1370
02:06:18,837 --> 02:06:20,472
Now get some sleep, sir.

1371
02:06:20,506 --> 02:06:21,407
Quite all right.

1372
02:06:23,776 --> 02:06:24,910
I must collect my thoughts.

1373
02:06:31,016 --> 02:06:31,984
Oh, it is morning.

1374
02:06:35,955 --> 02:06:37,723
We've talked all
through the night.

1375
02:06:38,924 --> 02:06:40,292
I'll be going back
to the Grange now.

1376
02:06:41,827 --> 02:06:43,762
I must rid myself
of this awful place.

1377
02:06:46,966 --> 02:06:50,736
Thank you, Miss Dean, for the
accommodation and the insight.

1378
02:06:58,811 --> 02:07:00,913
I do wish there was more.

1379
02:07:22,968 --> 02:07:25,170
It's good to see
you, Miss Catherine.

1380
02:07:25,204 --> 02:07:26,538
Are you feeling any better?

1381
02:07:30,442 --> 02:07:31,443
I suppose.

1382
02:07:33,112 --> 02:07:35,014
I found some of
your mother's books.

1383
02:07:36,382 --> 02:07:38,183
Would you like to
read one to us?

1384
02:07:44,256 --> 02:07:47,092
I am well aware that some
people now begin to doubt

1385
02:07:47,126 --> 02:07:50,329
about witchcraft or, at
any rate, feign to do so.

1386
02:07:57,970 --> 02:08:01,040
How dare you touch
me? Get away from me!

1387
02:08:03,042 --> 02:08:05,144
I despise you.

1388
02:08:05,177 --> 02:08:07,880
I would have given my
life for one kind word

1389
02:08:07,913 --> 02:08:10,149
when you were my jailer,
but you kept off.

1390
02:08:10,182 --> 02:08:11,116
I asked Mr. Heathcliff...

1391
02:08:11,150 --> 02:08:12,885
Be silent!

1392
02:08:14,053 --> 02:08:14,987
I would rather be anywhere

1393
02:08:15,020 --> 02:08:18,023
than hear your detestable
voice in my ear.

1394
02:08:40,045 --> 02:08:42,848
Continual, continuous streef.

1395
02:08:45,417 --> 02:08:46,318
Str, strife, strife.

1396
02:08:48,187 --> 02:08:49,021
No, no.

1397
02:08:56,562 --> 02:08:58,097
Stay out of that room.

1398
02:09:26,358 --> 02:09:27,459
Strife.

1399
02:09:35,601 --> 02:09:38,237
He's just like the cart
horse, isn't he, Nelly?

1400
02:09:39,371 --> 02:09:42,474
He does his work,
he eats his food,

1401
02:09:42,508 --> 02:09:44,009
and sleeps eternally.

1402
02:09:45,511 --> 02:09:49,248
Do you ever dream, Hareton?

1403
02:09:49,281 --> 02:09:51,116
Hareton, can you hear me?

1404
02:09:51,150 --> 02:09:53,619
Go to the devil,
and let me be.

1405
02:09:53,653 --> 02:09:57,322
I have found that I want
and am glad to be your cousin.

1406
02:09:57,356 --> 02:09:59,491
Well I shall have
nothing to do with you

1407
02:09:59,525 --> 02:10:03,028
and your mucky pride
and damn mocking tricks.

1408
02:10:03,061 --> 02:10:04,463
I'll go to hell, body and soul,

1409
02:10:04,496 --> 02:10:06,666
before I look
sideways at you again.

1410
02:10:06,699 --> 02:10:08,567
You should be friends
with your cousin.

1411
02:10:08,600 --> 02:10:09,803
- Friends?
- Mm-hm.

1412
02:10:09,836 --> 02:10:13,372
When she hates me and thinks
me not fit to wipe her boots?

1413
02:10:13,405 --> 02:10:17,142
It is not I who hates
you. It is you who hates me.

1414
02:10:17,176 --> 02:10:19,545
You hate me as much as
Mr. Heathcliff does.

1415
02:10:19,578 --> 02:10:21,246
You're a damn liar.

1416
02:10:22,414 --> 02:10:24,283
Why have I made him angry then

1417
02:10:24,316 --> 02:10:26,452
by taking your part 100 times?

1418
02:10:28,220 --> 02:10:29,656
I didn't know
you took my part.

1419
02:10:38,765 --> 02:10:41,233
I was miserable and
bitter at everyone, but

1420
02:10:43,235 --> 02:10:44,169
now I thank you.

1421
02:10:45,805 --> 02:10:47,339
And ask you to forgive me.

1422
02:10:59,117 --> 02:11:00,152
Catherine.

1423
02:11:00,185 --> 02:11:02,087
What should I
have done, Nelly?

1424
02:11:02,120 --> 02:11:05,324
He wouldn't shake my hand,
and he wouldn't look.

1425
02:11:09,228 --> 02:11:13,165
Nelly, since Hareton
won't speak to me,

1426
02:11:14,166 --> 02:11:17,603
can you tell him that,
if he takes this book,

1427
02:11:17,637 --> 02:11:19,137
I'll teach him to read it?

1428
02:11:20,305 --> 02:11:22,341
And if he refuses
it, I'll go upstairs

1429
02:11:22,374 --> 02:11:24,309
and never tease him again.

1430
02:11:29,716 --> 02:11:30,783
Hareton.

1431
02:11:30,817 --> 02:11:32,752
You'll be ashamed of me
every day of your life,

1432
02:11:32,785 --> 02:11:34,687
and more ashamed the
more you know me.

1433
02:11:36,288 --> 02:11:38,290
So you won't be my friend?

1434
02:13:19,491 --> 02:13:22,461
I thought I had cured
you of your laughing.

1435
02:13:22,494 --> 02:13:23,495
It was me.

1436
02:13:26,766 --> 02:13:30,903
Mr. Heathcliff, might I
plant a small flower garden

1437
02:13:30,937 --> 02:13:32,504
on the north side of the house?

1438
02:13:33,438 --> 02:13:34,339
No.

1439
02:13:34,373 --> 02:13:35,675
She already has.

1440
02:13:38,443 --> 02:13:40,680
What is your
grievance, Joseph?

1441
02:13:40,713 --> 02:13:44,583
Her and Hareton, they pulled
up three of my fine firs.

1442
02:13:44,616 --> 02:13:48,487
She's bewitched the lad with
bold eyes and forward ways.

1443
02:13:53,625 --> 02:13:54,861
Pull the flowers up.

1444
02:13:57,697 --> 02:14:00,298
How can you begrudge
me a few yards of earth

1445
02:14:00,332 --> 02:14:01,701
when you have taken all my land?

1446
02:14:01,734 --> 02:14:05,337
Your land? You insolent slut.

1447
02:14:07,472 --> 02:14:08,440
You never had any.

1448
02:14:08,473 --> 02:14:09,574
And my money.

1449
02:14:11,978 --> 02:14:12,879
Enough.

1450
02:14:12,912 --> 02:14:14,413
And Hareton's land and money.

1451
02:14:16,415 --> 02:14:18,718
If you strike me,
Hareton will strike you,

1452
02:14:18,751 --> 02:14:20,519
so you might as well sit down.

1453
02:14:22,587 --> 02:14:26,525
Don't intend to
rouse him against me.

1454
02:14:37,469 --> 02:14:41,273
You should avoid putting
me into a passion.

1455
02:14:45,945 --> 02:14:48,213
Take her out of my sight.

1456
02:15:09,936 --> 02:15:12,304
Why don't you eat, Papa?

1457
02:15:19,444 --> 02:15:20,479
Go.

1458
02:15:24,083 --> 02:15:27,419
I don't know how you can
stand to be away from her.

1459
02:15:29,321 --> 02:15:30,255
Go, please.

1460
02:15:32,557 --> 02:15:33,391
Please.

1461
02:15:35,027 --> 02:15:35,928
Leave me.

1462
02:16:05,357 --> 02:16:07,026
Heathcliff.

1463
02:16:55,041 --> 02:16:58,577
It is a poor conclusion,
is it not, Nelly?

1464
02:17:00,646 --> 02:17:02,514
My old enemies
have not beaten me,

1465
02:17:02,547 --> 02:17:04,784
and now is the precise time

1466
02:17:04,817 --> 02:17:08,453
to revenge myself
on their children.

1467
02:17:08,486 --> 02:17:11,724
I could do it, and no
one could hinder me.

1468
02:17:19,564 --> 02:17:20,900
Where's the use?

1469
02:17:22,601 --> 02:17:25,638
I have lost the sense
of their destruction.

1470
02:17:26,939 --> 02:17:27,940
Want a cup of tea?

1471
02:17:29,642 --> 02:17:31,744
There is a strange
change, Nelly.

1472
02:17:34,579 --> 02:17:37,717
In every tree, in every cloud,

1473
02:17:38,684 --> 02:17:41,687
filling the air at night
and caught by glimpses

1474
02:17:41,721 --> 02:17:43,622
in every object by day.

1475
02:17:47,159 --> 02:17:49,662
I am surrounded by her image.

1476
02:18:01,007 --> 02:18:05,077
The most ordinary faces
mock me with resemblance.

1477
02:18:06,245 --> 02:18:08,613
The entire world is
a dreadful memorandum

1478
02:18:08,648 --> 02:18:11,050
that she did exist
and I have lost her.

1479
02:18:15,788 --> 02:18:19,725
I cannot continue in
this condition, Cathy.

1480
02:18:19,759 --> 02:18:20,726
I have a single wish,

1481
02:18:20,760 --> 02:18:23,796
and my entire being is
yearning to attain it.

1482
02:18:24,764 --> 02:18:27,700
I have yearned for so
long and so unwaveringly

1483
02:18:27,733 --> 02:18:29,869
that I am convinced
it must be reached

1484
02:18:29,902 --> 02:18:33,005
because it has
devoured my existence.

1485
02:18:46,719 --> 02:18:48,721
It has been long flight,

1486
02:18:51,057 --> 02:18:53,558
and I wish it were over.

1487
02:20:39,698 --> 02:20:40,766
Heathcliff.

1488
02:20:51,811 --> 02:20:54,713
Whereas the
contrary brings bliss

1489
02:20:55,781 --> 02:20:58,951
and is a pattern
of celestial peace.

1490
02:21:57,943 --> 02:22:00,713
To you, I've made myself
worse than the devil.

1491
02:23:42,948 --> 02:23:44,817
Morning, Heathcliff.

1492
02:23:49,321 --> 02:23:50,889
Heathcliff?

1493
02:24:18,550 --> 02:24:19,385
Joseph.

1494
02:24:21,620 --> 02:24:22,454
Joseph!

1495
02:24:30,162 --> 02:24:31,397
Hareton!

1496
02:25:18,210 --> 02:25:23,215
And still, I don't like
being by myself in this house.

1497
02:25:23,949 --> 02:25:25,117
I cannot help it.

1498
02:25:25,150 --> 02:25:26,085
I should be glad
when they leave it

1499
02:25:26,118 --> 02:25:27,553
and shift over to the Grange.

1500
02:25:29,188 --> 02:25:31,156
Hareton and Catherine are
going to the Grange then?

1501
02:25:31,190 --> 02:25:34,293
Aye, as soon as they're
married on New Year's Day.

1502
02:25:34,326 --> 02:25:35,894
Since you're
vacating the Grange,

1503
02:25:35,928 --> 02:25:38,330
there's no use for you
staying in this dreary house.

1504
02:25:39,598 --> 02:25:41,033
Who would live here then?

1505
02:25:41,066 --> 02:25:43,001
Joseph will take
care of the house,

1506
02:25:43,035 --> 02:25:44,470
but the rest of it
will be shut up.

1507
02:25:47,005 --> 02:25:49,408
For the use of such ghosts
that choose to inhabit it.

1508
02:25:51,644 --> 02:25:52,478
Nay.

1509
02:25:54,046 --> 02:25:56,081
I believe the dead
are at last at peace.

1510
02:25:59,485 --> 02:26:01,420
They are afraid of nothing.

1511
02:26:01,453 --> 02:26:04,957
Together, they would brave
Satan and all his legion.

1512
02:27:03,215 --> 02:27:06,185
I wonder how anyone can
imagine unquiet slumbers

1513
02:27:06,952 --> 02:27:09,221
for the sleepers in
that quiet earth.
