1
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:51,648
Hey.

2
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,615
Colonel, give us the room, please.

3
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,958
Four years retired yet two salutes?

4
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,336
- Shows respect.
- Have a seat.

5
00:04:58,715 --> 00:04:59,967
Do you know who I am?

6
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,009
No.

7
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,428
Well, if you were to guess.

8
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,890
Judging by your age, appearance,

9
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:11,019
and how a Marine colonel
just followed your order without a yip,

10
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:14,106
I'd guess you're some kind
of high-level spook.

11
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,530
Your father and grandfather served?

12
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,240
Yes.

13
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:27,952
As an elite sniper,
you have 113 confirmed kills

14
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:30,705
and an additional 81 probable kills.

15
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:32,124
Are those numbers accurate?

16
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:33,458
No.

17
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:37,421
- Are the actual numbers fewer or greater?
- Greater.

18
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,674
As a veteran, how many private contractors
have you worked for?

19
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:42,592
Eleven.

20
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:45,721
But you also still work for
the Marine Corps on occasion?

21
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,389
Anytime they call.

22
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:52,269
And are you presently under
any private or military contract?

23
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:54,980
No.

24
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:59,443
You're an extremely rare talent, Levi.

25
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:01,778
Why not?

26
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:07,450
In June, some corporate shrink
told me that I was unfit for a mission,

27
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:09,243
but I'm sure you already know that.

28
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,537
So why are you asking me?

29
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:15,416
Do you think you're fit for service?

30
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:16,960
Doesn't matter what I think.

31
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,048
So, do you presently have a girlfriend?

32
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,300
Anyone special?

33
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,011
Someone who couldn't live without you?

34
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,349
- No.
- Why not?

35
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:33,060
Just not how it goes for me.

36
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:39,315
How about meds, illegal drugs, alcohol?

37
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,651
No drugs.

38
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:42,568
But if I time it right,

39
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,989
three and a half ounces of booze right
before I go to bed helps with the dreams.

40
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:50,201
Have you tried Nitrazepam or Prazosin?

41
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:52,037
Have you ever killed someone
at long range?

42
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,084
Pills affect my accuracy.

43
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:05,049
Levi, you could have contested
the psych test and seen another doctor.

44
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:05,968
Why didn't you?

45
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:07,593
I had no reason to.

46
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,054
You had no reason?

47
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:13,642
There's not a lot of
reasons for me right now.

48
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:20,983
What if I gave you a reason?

49
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,298
Hey, Daddy.

50
00:07:57,603 --> 00:07:58,437
To music.

51
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:00,856
To music.

52
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:04,483
My Little Lion...

53
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,651
How are you?

54
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:06,570
You know.

55
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,405
Better now I see you.

56
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:13,452
There is a rumor
you were photographed in Belarus.

57
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,412
A drone.

58
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,123
Is that possible?

59
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:24,171
Moscow cannot risk having a direct link
to the oligarch's death.

60
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,511
He had four children.

61
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,014
Give it to me.

62
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,308
Give me your shame.

63
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:58,455
The Belarusian made himself rich trading
in white phosphorus bombs and land mines.

64
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:01,875
How many children's legs were lost?

65
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:06,380
How many little faces were forever burnt
by those transactions?

66
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,634
You give the shame to me...

67
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:18,392
And you move forward.

68
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:20,811
It's not so easy anymore.

69
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:23,856
I don't sleep.

70
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,482
Sometimes for days.

71
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:29,987
Stay with me for a week or two.

72
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:34,407
And we'll make a stew.
It would be good for both of us.

73
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:35,325
I can't.

74
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:39,328
Rabinovich has ordered me to a briefing
first thing tomorrow morning in Moscow.

75
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,581
To hell with Rabinovich,
and to hell with Moscow.

76
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,416
You're not Russian, you're Lithuanian.

77
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:46,628
He says I'll be going dark
for at least a year.

78
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:48,630
Perhaps more.

79
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:52,092
Hey.

80
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,094
Did you go to the doctor
I arranged for you?

81
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,012
The specialist?

82
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:58,098
- Yes, I did.
- And?

83
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:00,600
There's nothing to be done.

84
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:02,102
Look at me, I'm a wretch.

85
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,813
Cancer eats me from the inside out.

86
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:07,482
Liver, pancreas.

87
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,485
Death will be a welcome change.

88
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:12,487
And what if I'm not back?

89
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:17,910
You'll be alone,
and I won't even know when it happens.

90
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:20,370
An easy solution.

91
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:22,581
I've already decided.

92
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:26,167
February 14th, Valentine's Day.

93
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:27,211
What are you talking about?

94
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:29,463
I'm going to do it myself.

95
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,089
Assuming I'm not already dead, of course.

96
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,175
Dad.

97
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:38,180
- Dad, you're not...
- It's my life to take.

98
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:43,060
I will be ready to finally rest here
next to your mother.

99
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:49,982
So, wherever you are,
you light a candle for me,

100
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,570
you look at the Hunter in the night sky,
then you'll know.

101
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,785
Come on now, Little Lion.

102
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,954
Let's have our beer,

103
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:03,747
play a song,

104
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:06,917
and say a proper goodbye.

105
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:04,725
Place your left hand on the pad.

106
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:12,482
Put your watch, your smart phone,
and your ID in the case.

107
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,526
It just tells time.

108
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:21,866
In three minutes,
we reach the edge of the no-fly zone.

109
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:23,368
That's as far as we can take you.

110
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:26,371
From the drop, you'll have
another 38 klicks north on foot.

111
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:29,290
You're expected by 1600 hours tomorrow.

112
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,709
Open it on the ground.

113
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:38,717
Where are we?

114
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,386
I'm not authorized to answer that.

115
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:09,892
At long last, my sweet prince has come.

116
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:13,896
Punctual even. Spot on time. What a guy.

117
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:18,858
Jasper D. Drake, Royal Marines Commandos.
Just call me JD.

118
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:21,986
Levi Kane, former US Marine, scout sniper.

119
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:23,154
Mercenary?

120
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:24,531
Private contractor.

121
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:26,616
So, what did they tell you
about this mission?

122
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:27,868
Not a damn thing.

123
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:30,578
They gave me an unmarked topo map.

124
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:31,996
I don't even know what country I'm in.

125
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:34,666
I've been here an entire year
and I have no idea where I am.

126
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:36,335
It's messed up, right?

127
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:39,213
But that is just
the tippity-top of the iceberg.

128
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:42,632
Man, am I glad to see you.

129
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:43,966
Not a lot of contact, huh?

130
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,012
You're the first person
I've spoken to face-to-face in a year.

131
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,139
You're all alone out here?

132
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:52,017
And my tour rotation
officially ends at midnight.

133
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,685
- So I'm the relief?
- Affirmative.

134
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:57,064
Look, we'll get a drink
and I'll explain everything.

135
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,316
There she is.

136
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:01,526
West Tower Observation Post.

137
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:04,321
Your home away from home
for the next 365 days.

138
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,575
Completely self-sufficient, solar with
a generator backup, rain system,

139
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:12,871
wild game is plentiful,
and there's a garden right there.

140
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:14,581
Everything you need.

141
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,583
What's that on the other side?

142
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:19,836
That is East Tower.

143
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:21,754
Contact with the other side
is strictly forbidden,

144
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:25,091
which is irrelevant given the land mines
and lethal tactical barriers

145
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:26,801
to the north and south of the Gorge.

146
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:28,594
Can't get to the other side anyway.

147
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,680
In practical terms,
East Tower is not an issue.

148
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:32,724
They do their thing. You do yours.

149
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:35,727
I did see movement over that side
earlier this morning.

150
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:38,564
Think they just completed
their annual rotation too.

151
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:40,982
Theoretically, the job's simple.

152
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:42,483
You're not the principal line of defense.

153
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:45,486
You're more like
a highly skilled maintenance man.

154
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:47,446
Every day, you walk the western rim.

155
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,450
There are automatic Phalanx gun turrets
every 600 meters or so.

156
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:52,660
You restock the ammo in the auto gun,

157
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:55,955
check the containment fence,
cloakers and suspended mines.

158
00:15:55,956 --> 00:16:00,001
There's an armory in the bunker outside.
Weapons, tools, replacement ammo, mines.

159
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:01,086
Whatever you need.

160
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:03,881
Radio check every 30 days.

161
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:05,882
What's a cloaker?

162
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:08,134
Cloaker is a type of
satellite transmitter.

163
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:10,261
There's one every kilometer or so
along the rim,

164
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:14,182
each with its own power
and backup power source.

165
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:16,393
- What do they do?
- They cloak.

166
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:19,353
They send a false signal
to all the satellites

167
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:20,856
that pass overhead on a given day.

168
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:24,442
They're designed to render the Gorge
invisible to spy satellites,

169
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:26,278
but they also work with
shit like Google Earth.

170
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,115
There is no outside communication here.

171
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:32,910
No cell, no sat, no nothing.

172
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,411
In case of an emergency,
there's a panic button

173
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:38,581
on the dedicated shortwave radio
you use for monthly radio checks.

174
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:40,541
Button triggers a signal,
which lets them know that...

175
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:41,543
Let's who know?

176
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:44,545
The powers that be, mate.

177
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:45,464
Whoever.

178
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:48,509
Did you spy the old air-raid sirens
atop the tower?

179
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:53,387
If, somehow, all the cloakers fail at once
or if the Gorge is ever overrun,

180
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:57,099
their automated system executes
something called a Straydog protocol.

181
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,768
Straydog protocol.

182
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:00,145
- What is that?
- No idea.

183
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:03,899
But if you hear those air-raid sirens,
you run like hell.

184
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:06,275
Copy that.

185
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:07,860
Look, here's the deal.

186
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,154
This place is old.

187
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:12,323
I'm talking end of the Second World War,
early Cold War shit.

188
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:13,783
And it's secret.

189
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:15,535
Way back then, an agreement was made,

190
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:17,787
and a coalition formed
to keep it a secret.

191
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:20,914
So, now, every year, a new representative
from one of the western nations

192
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:24,418
patrols the western rim and someone
on the other side patrols the eastern rim.

193
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:25,503
They're your counterpart.

194
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:28,631
You're telling me
leaders from the East and West

195
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:31,008
have been secretly working together
for the last 75 years?

196
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:35,471
No. I'm telling you there have been
nine Soviet Russian heads of state

197
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:38,183
and 13 US presidents
since the coalitions were formed.

198
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:40,435
And not one of them
has known about the Gorge.

199
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:42,020
Give that a spin.

200
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:49,403
Potato vodka. The still is in the armory.

201
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:52,030
That's good.

202
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:56,159
The recipe's been passed down for decades.
So please don't mess it up.

203
00:17:58,537 --> 00:18:01,582
Listen, I'm sorry, man. But I just
feel like I'm missing something.

204
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:05,794
So apart from keeping this place a secret,
what's the mission?

205
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:08,671
I need to keep people
from going in the Gorge?

206
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:09,590
No.

207
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:13,552
You need to stop what's in the Gorge
from coming out.

208
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:19,974
A year ago, I was in your boots and my
predecessor gave me the exact same speech.

209
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:21,435
And what did I think of him?

210
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,314
- That he's completely full of shit.
- Exactly.

211
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:28,316
But trust me,
keep your eyes on the central Gorge walls.

212
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:29,567
They're the most scalable.

213
00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:32,153
Sensor miniguns further north and south
should take care of the rest.

214
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:33,739
Scale wh... Take care of what?

215
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:44,666
What the hell is that?

216
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:47,377
That is what we call the Hollow Men.

217
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:49,712
Nobody knows exactly what they are.

218
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:51,924
I don't even know why they're called that.

219
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:56,260
- It's the name of a T.S. Eliot poem.
- I don't know anything about that.

220
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:59,388
All I know is that someone who had our job
called them that a long time ago

221
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:00,474
and the name stuck.

222
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:03,726
What I can tell you is in the late 1940s,

223
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:06,187
they sent three entire battalions,

224
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:09,149
2,400 men on horseback,
into the Gorge to clean it out.

225
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,360
Not a single man returned.

226
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:14,780
After that, they shifted to
a purely containment strategy.

227
00:19:16,365 --> 00:19:18,491
- How do you know all this?
- Same way you do.

228
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:20,034
We're all briefed by our predecessor.

229
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:23,371
- Okay, so this could be one...
- A decades-long game of telephone.

230
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:24,289
Yeah.

231
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:30,712
JD, what do you think's
really going on here?

232
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:35,300
Well, the theory I think summarizes
the situation most succinctly

233
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:41,682
is the Gorge is the door to hell
and we're standing guard at the gate.

234
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,648
- Take care of yourself.
- Good luck, man.

235
00:22:05,868 --> 00:22:07,660
Man, am I happy to see you.

236
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:08,786
Right on, brother!

237
00:22:08,787 --> 00:22:12,290
I need you to quickly confirm
your identity.

238
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:15,793
Jasper D. Drake. Countersign: blue arrow.

239
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:17,546
Thank you for your service.

240
00:22:28,557 --> 00:22:30,141
Rotation complete.

241
00:22:30,142 --> 00:22:31,310
Copy that.

242
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,840
This is West Tower performing radio check.

243
00:23:43,841 --> 00:23:44,925
Do you copy?

244
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:49,428
I repeat, this is West Tower
performing radio check.

245
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:50,972
Do you copy? Over.

246
00:23:50,973 --> 00:23:52,808
Authentication code?

247
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:56,103
Alpha, Bravo, nine, seven, Omega.

248
00:23:56,979 --> 00:23:59,438
- Enemy contact?
- Negative.

249
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:00,774
Cloaker status?

250
00:24:01,275 --> 00:24:02,358
Green.

251
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:03,777
Procedure is complete.

252
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:05,863
30 days until next radio check.

253
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:08,407
- Wait, I have a question that...
- Procedure is complete.

254
00:24:29,636 --> 00:24:30,971
Robert Frost.

255
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:02,877
"If you're lonely when you're alone,
you're in bad company.

256
00:25:02,878 --> 00:25:03,962
Sartre.

257
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:06,173
Jasper 'JD' Drake."

258
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:13,596
"Everything is a dangerous drug
except reality, which is unendurable.

259
00:25:13,597 --> 00:25:16,934
Connolly. Captain Getty Frederick. 1986."

260
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:31,615
"Only those who will risk going too far
can possibly find out how far one can go.

261
00:25:32,241 --> 00:25:33,408
T.S. Eliot.

262
00:25:34,868 --> 00:25:37,704
Captain Bradford Shaw. 1947."

263
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:36,490
Oh, shit.

264
00:28:38,468 --> 00:28:41,847
May you have a very long life

265
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:45,475
We wish you

266
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:47,686
A very

267
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:51,148
Long life

268
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:58,197
Hurray, hurray, hurray

269
00:47:28,056 --> 00:47:32,728
"Only those who will risk going too far
can possibly find out how far one can go."

270
00:48:24,446 --> 00:48:26,615
What are you doing?

271
00:48:29,785 --> 00:48:30,869
Shit.

272
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:41,547
Oh, my, my, my.

273
00:51:30,507 --> 00:51:31,592
Good evening, Drasa.

274
00:51:32,718 --> 00:51:34,761
Even though I'm not supposed to be here.

275
00:51:35,971 --> 00:51:37,055
Good evening, Levi.

276
00:51:37,639 --> 00:51:40,601
And we're cloaked, so who's watching?

277
00:51:44,605 --> 00:51:46,857
I made rabbit pie.

278
00:51:47,983 --> 00:51:49,151
Do you like rabbit pie?

279
00:51:50,777 --> 00:51:51,862
I intend to.

280
00:51:53,989 --> 00:51:54,990
What's that you're growing?

281
00:51:58,118 --> 00:51:59,244
I brought you flowers.

282
00:52:01,205 --> 00:52:02,289
'Course you did.

283
00:52:03,332 --> 00:52:04,374
Thank you.

284
00:52:10,297 --> 00:52:11,297
You're staring.

285
00:52:11,298 --> 00:52:13,634
Sorry. It's...

286
00:52:14,218 --> 00:52:15,302
Yes?

287
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:21,517
There's a lot more green in your eyes
than I was expecting.

288
00:52:25,646 --> 00:52:26,980
You smell.

289
00:52:28,273 --> 00:52:29,191
Terribly.

290
00:52:31,151 --> 00:52:32,151
I know.

291
00:52:32,152 --> 00:52:33,569
I underestimated the cable sag.

292
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:35,363
I had to do the back half by hand.

293
00:52:35,364 --> 00:52:38,533
Yeah. I don't think I can allow you
to come in smelling this way.

294
00:52:38,534 --> 00:52:41,411
Why don't you go wash up quick
at the bathhouse?

295
00:52:41,954 --> 00:52:44,581
I'll set out some fresh clothes
from my predecessors outside the door.

296
00:53:47,853 --> 00:53:53,107
Yukon? Siberia? Remote Scandinavia, maybe?

297
00:53:53,108 --> 00:53:54,817
I don't know.
They sedated me on the flight.

298
00:53:54,818 --> 00:53:57,154
- I'm not sure how long I was out.
- Same.

299
00:53:57,863 --> 00:53:59,864
It's somewhere
in the far northern hemisphere though.

300
00:53:59,865 --> 00:54:00,948
I know that much.

301
00:54:00,949 --> 00:54:02,408
How can you be so sure about that?

302
00:54:02,409 --> 00:54:03,869
The seasons.

303
00:54:04,578 --> 00:54:06,162
It was early fall when I left the States.

304
00:54:06,163 --> 00:54:07,331
It was still fall when I arrived.

305
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:09,291
Military?

306
00:54:10,667 --> 00:54:11,667
Marines.

307
00:54:11,668 --> 00:54:12,627
Former.

308
00:54:12,628 --> 00:54:14,880
What's the longest kill shot
you've ever made?

309
00:54:15,881 --> 00:54:17,298
Don't say that you don't know.

310
00:54:17,299 --> 00:54:19,509
Every top-shelf sniper
knows the distance of every ticket

311
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:21,302
they've ever punched, so come on.

312
00:54:21,303 --> 00:54:22,762
3,241 meters.

313
00:54:22,763 --> 00:54:23,972
Thirty-two hun...

314
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:25,474
A kill shot?

315
00:54:26,558 --> 00:54:27,809
Yeah.

316
00:54:29,895 --> 00:54:30,979
That would put you in...

317
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:32,814
Top five in the world.

318
00:54:33,982 --> 00:54:36,902
Did you make that impossible shot
in Yemen, May of last year?

319
00:54:39,696 --> 00:54:41,072
I did not participate in,

320
00:54:41,073 --> 00:54:44,200
nor do I have any knowledge of, any
operation in Yemen in May of last year.

321
00:54:44,201 --> 00:54:48,246
Rumor was it was windy,
25 knots east to west, with gusts of 40.

322
00:54:48,247 --> 00:54:51,082
That would have been
a very, very good shot.

323
00:54:51,083 --> 00:54:53,000
3,800 meters.

324
00:54:53,001 --> 00:54:53,919
World record.

325
00:54:54,503 --> 00:54:56,421
I'd kiss the ring
of whoever made that shot.

326
00:54:57,714 --> 00:54:58,882
Too bad it wasn't you.

327
00:55:02,845 --> 00:55:03,720
What?

328
00:55:07,349 --> 00:55:10,268
I've been staring at this gorge every day
for the last six months.

329
00:55:10,269 --> 00:55:14,982
And I gotta say,
the view is much better over here.

330
00:55:18,777 --> 00:55:20,695
You know what I keep thinking about,
night after night,

331
00:55:20,696 --> 00:55:22,488
while I sit over there on that platform?

332
00:55:22,489 --> 00:55:24,241
How you're gonna get in my pants?

333
00:55:30,414 --> 00:55:31,664
Well, after that.

334
00:55:31,665 --> 00:55:33,291
Yes, after that, sorry.

335
00:55:33,292 --> 00:55:35,586
Please, tell me.
What have you been thinking about?

336
00:55:37,713 --> 00:55:39,298
What's the truth about this place?

337
00:55:40,257 --> 00:55:42,801
What's the truth about those Hollow Men
down in the Gorge?

338
00:55:44,094 --> 00:55:45,220
You know,

339
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:49,224
a long time ago, before I was born,

340
00:55:50,475 --> 00:55:51,685
my father was KGB.

341
00:55:52,311 --> 00:55:56,315
And years later, when I was a child,
he would say to me...

342
00:55:57,983 --> 00:56:01,653
"Drasa, my Little Lion,
you don't want to know the truth.

343
00:56:02,613 --> 00:56:03,988
It's better if you don't know."

344
00:56:03,989 --> 00:56:06,366
And I would bitch and whine,
and say, "Why, Daddy?

345
00:56:07,075 --> 00:56:08,619
Why don't I want to know the truth?"

346
00:56:11,205 --> 00:56:12,039
What did he say?

347
00:56:12,998 --> 00:56:14,249
He would say,

348
00:56:14,958 --> 00:56:17,960
"Because too much truth
puts sadness in your heart

349
00:56:17,961 --> 00:56:20,005
and madness in your mind."

350
00:56:20,923 --> 00:56:21,924
I don't know.

351
00:56:23,467 --> 00:56:25,802
In my experience,
it's hiding the truth that does that.

352
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,013
And when did you learn that?

353
00:56:30,766 --> 00:56:32,142
First time I pulled the trigger.

354
00:56:34,019 --> 00:56:35,062
Will you tell me about it?

355
00:56:39,399 --> 00:56:40,566
It was just outside of Belize,

356
00:56:40,567 --> 00:56:43,153
and I was on a fishing boat
two klicks away.

357
00:56:45,322 --> 00:56:48,784
I've had the same recurring
nightmare about it ever since.

358
00:56:50,369 --> 00:56:51,370
Who have you told this to?

359
00:56:53,455 --> 00:56:54,289
Just you.

360
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:58,210
Why did you choose this profession?

361
00:57:03,757 --> 00:57:06,635
Hunting was just a part of
my homeschooling growing up in Oregon,

362
00:57:07,261 --> 00:57:11,682
and my dad,
he was the best instructor I ever had.

363
00:57:13,141 --> 00:57:13,976
He loved it.

364
00:57:15,227 --> 00:57:16,311
He made me love it.

365
00:57:16,812 --> 00:57:17,938
Love what exactly?

366
00:57:19,314 --> 00:57:20,941
The art of the perfect shot.

367
00:57:24,611 --> 00:57:25,445
Yeah.

368
00:57:25,946 --> 00:57:26,947
Do you still love it?

369
00:57:27,447 --> 00:57:28,615
Not like I did.

370
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:35,372
I can't compartmentalize
the way I used to.

371
00:57:37,958 --> 00:57:39,710
My father always heard my secrets.

372
00:57:40,836 --> 00:57:42,212
I didn't have to bury them.

373
00:57:46,383 --> 00:57:51,805
You bury enough secrets,
the graveyard runs out of room.

374
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:01,190
You dragged your mattress up the stairs
and made your bed here.

375
00:58:02,399 --> 00:58:03,650
For tactical reasons.

376
00:58:04,401 --> 00:58:05,569
I did the same thing.

377
01:00:03,729 --> 01:00:05,063
Did you lie to me, Levi?

378
01:00:05,981 --> 01:00:07,191
About what?

379
01:00:08,692 --> 01:00:10,152
Being a terrible dancer.

380
01:00:12,654 --> 01:00:13,822
Maybe a little bit.

381
01:01:10,087 --> 01:01:11,088
There.

382
01:01:11,588 --> 01:01:13,882
Those three close together.

383
01:01:15,217 --> 01:01:16,593
Orion's Belt.

384
01:01:17,427 --> 01:01:18,428
I see it.

385
01:01:19,388 --> 01:01:22,266
He told me to look at the Hunter
on Valentine's Day

386
01:01:22,766 --> 01:01:24,560
knowing that he had ended it.

387
01:01:25,185 --> 01:01:26,270
I'm sorry.

388
01:01:30,816 --> 01:01:34,278
What do you do
when the sadness overwhelms you?

389
01:01:36,822 --> 01:01:39,575
Sometimes I'll read a poem.

390
01:01:42,619 --> 01:01:44,121
Maybe try and write one.

391
01:01:45,205 --> 01:01:46,373
You write poetry?

392
01:01:48,041 --> 01:01:49,293
Almost every day.

393
01:01:50,711 --> 01:01:52,004
Seriously?

394
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:54,882
I even took a class.

395
01:01:55,757 --> 01:01:59,344
Wednesday nights, 4:00 to 7:00 p.m.,
at Mesa Community College.

396
01:02:00,637 --> 01:02:03,515
Well, are you talented?

397
01:02:04,266 --> 01:02:05,516
No, I'm terrible.

398
01:02:05,517 --> 01:02:07,686
Sure. Like you're a terrible dancer?

399
01:02:08,187 --> 01:02:09,479
Yeah.

400
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:11,899
Will you write me a terrible poem?

401
01:02:12,774 --> 01:02:14,109
Maybe I already have.

402
01:02:15,527 --> 01:02:16,695
Recite it for me.

403
01:02:17,487 --> 01:02:19,698
- Absolutely not.
- Oh, come on.

404
01:02:20,616 --> 01:02:21,949
No chance in hell.

405
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:23,826
- At least tell me the title?
- No.

406
01:02:23,827 --> 01:02:25,620
Well, then I don't believe you.

407
01:02:25,621 --> 01:02:27,830
You haven't written
a terrible poem for me, have you?

408
01:02:27,831 --> 01:02:29,207
I have.

409
01:02:29,208 --> 01:02:30,625
But I just started it.

410
01:02:30,626 --> 01:02:32,461
Then tell me the title.

411
01:02:34,171 --> 01:02:37,049
- It's a working title.
- Tell me the working title.

412
01:02:40,427 --> 01:02:42,221
"She Collapsed the Night."

413
01:02:49,186 --> 01:02:50,229
It's that bad?

414
01:02:50,979 --> 01:02:51,980
I love it.

415
01:02:53,815 --> 01:02:55,859
Shit. I love it.

416
01:02:56,485 --> 01:02:58,194
No, you have to tell me.

417
01:02:58,195 --> 01:03:00,071
- Come on. Please. Please.
- There's no...

418
01:03:00,072 --> 01:03:01,657
That's not happening.

419
01:03:05,285 --> 01:03:06,786
Did you like the rabbit pie?

420
01:03:06,787 --> 01:03:07,871
No.

421
01:03:09,206 --> 01:03:11,041
I fucking loved the rabbit pie.

422
01:03:33,397 --> 01:03:34,565
No!

423
01:03:36,775 --> 01:03:37,901
Levi!

424
01:06:31,825 --> 01:06:34,076
Don't touch it.
It's some kind of adhesive.

425
01:06:34,077 --> 01:06:35,162
Okay.

426
01:06:37,122 --> 01:06:38,081
You came for me.

427
01:06:39,333 --> 01:06:40,918
Like you wouldn't do the same.

428
01:06:44,463 --> 01:06:46,590
- What is this place?
- I don't know.

429
01:06:47,216 --> 01:06:49,258
Please tell me
you brought an auto ascender.

430
01:06:49,259 --> 01:06:50,469
Of course I did.

431
01:06:50,969 --> 01:06:53,263
Let's head to the east wall
and find the cable.

432
01:07:21,208 --> 01:07:22,209
Drasa.

433
01:08:12,676 --> 01:08:14,011
- You good?
- Yeah.

434
01:08:15,095 --> 01:08:16,555
What do you think they wanted?

435
01:08:17,264 --> 01:08:21,435
Given how emaciated they are,
my guess is that to them we're food.

436
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:23,769
One of them rode off.

437
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:25,314
Yeah, I saw that.

438
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:31,277
No.

439
01:08:31,278 --> 01:08:32,946
- What?
- The auto ascender.

440
01:08:34,531 --> 01:08:39,077
Must have fallen out in the river,
and it's 500 meters to the top.

441
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,290
We're stuck here.

442
01:08:49,421 --> 01:08:50,671
We follow the river south.

443
01:08:51,423 --> 01:08:53,300
Has to drain out of the Gorge somewhere.

444
01:08:55,551 --> 01:08:56,845
It's a military uniform.

445
01:08:59,473 --> 01:09:02,308
Old military. First Airborne American.

446
01:09:02,309 --> 01:09:05,686
I saw British SAS
and a Soviet Spetsnaz back there.

447
01:09:05,687 --> 01:09:06,897
Postwar.

448
01:09:10,192 --> 01:09:12,694
All these uniforms are from the 1940s.

449
01:09:15,656 --> 01:09:17,115
Cavalry on horseback.

450
01:09:17,783 --> 01:09:19,660
They're the lost battalions.

451
01:09:20,953 --> 01:09:23,037
They should be long dead, Levi.

452
01:09:25,207 --> 01:09:26,500
We should keep moving.

453
01:10:07,165 --> 01:10:09,458
"This is the way the world ends.

454
01:10:09,459 --> 01:10:12,004
Not with a bang but a whimper."

455
01:10:13,172 --> 01:10:17,759
It's from the T.S. Eliot poem about people
stuck in a world between life and death.

456
01:10:18,677 --> 01:10:20,511
It's called "The Hollow Men."

457
01:10:20,512 --> 01:10:22,097
The Hollow Men.

458
01:10:24,016 --> 01:10:25,058
Yeah.

459
01:11:17,110 --> 01:11:18,904
This damage looks seismic.

460
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:20,989
Earthquake maybe.

461
01:13:10,891 --> 01:13:11,934
Cyanide.

462
01:13:12,976 --> 01:13:14,645
They chose to do it themselves.

463
01:13:17,606 --> 01:13:18,607
What's worse than death?

464
01:13:19,358 --> 01:13:20,776
This place is evil.

465
01:15:31,573 --> 01:15:33,075
Making a hole!

466
01:15:49,633 --> 01:15:53,011
Shit. They're everywhere.
We're too exposed.

467
01:15:54,179 --> 01:15:55,264
The Gorge wall.

468
01:16:00,477 --> 01:16:01,644
Levi.

469
01:16:01,645 --> 01:16:03,187
We get boxed in, we're screwed.

470
01:16:03,188 --> 01:16:04,648
We're screwed anyway.

471
01:16:09,987 --> 01:16:11,029
Barricade.

472
01:18:35,257 --> 01:18:36,258
Levi.

473
01:18:43,182 --> 01:18:44,724
It's a backup generator.

474
01:18:44,725 --> 01:18:47,227
Propane remains stable indefinitely, so...

475
01:19:18,550 --> 01:19:23,305
It is July 12th or 13th, 1946.

476
01:19:24,264 --> 01:19:25,890
Our community here was formed

477
01:19:25,891 --> 01:19:28,810
as part of a top secret coalition
of nations from both East and West.

478
01:19:29,686 --> 01:19:31,395
During the last years of World War II,

479
01:19:31,396 --> 01:19:33,648
while Robert Oppenheimer
and his Los Alamos community

480
01:19:33,649 --> 01:19:34,815
developed the atom bomb,

481
01:19:34,816 --> 01:19:38,445
we were developing similarly
destructive biochemical missiles.

482
01:19:39,196 --> 01:19:43,074
Six days ago,
an 8.1 earthquake struck this location,

483
01:19:43,075 --> 01:19:46,202
severely compromising
the integrity of our facility.

484
01:19:46,203 --> 01:19:51,124
Our duty here is no longer about research,
but containment.

485
01:19:54,711 --> 01:19:57,171
We are working around the clock

486
01:19:57,172 --> 01:19:59,883
to ensure this toxin
doesn't escape the Gorge.

487
01:20:01,301 --> 01:20:03,469
Exposure to the biochemical contaminant

488
01:20:03,470 --> 01:20:08,057
has literally merged the genetic DNA
of the biological entities

489
01:20:08,058 --> 01:20:09,393
in our gorge environment.

490
01:20:09,977 --> 01:20:15,774
Human DNA has merged with plants,
animals and even insects.

491
01:20:17,651 --> 01:20:20,862
Some people are more resistant
to contamination than others,

492
01:20:20,863 --> 01:20:24,283
especially if exposure is limited
to hours instead of days.

493
01:20:25,367 --> 01:20:29,413
If infected, mutations will begin
to appear within five days.

494
01:20:29,913 --> 01:20:33,125
They will present themselves physically,
like this.

495
01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:40,173
Our strategic forethought
in choosing this isolated location

496
01:20:40,174 --> 01:20:43,718
is the only factor that may possibly save
the rest of humankind

497
01:20:43,719 --> 01:20:45,971
from the fate
that we have sealed for ourselves.

498
01:20:47,514 --> 01:20:48,765
I'm so sorry.

499
01:20:49,474 --> 01:20:51,602
May God have mercy on our souls.

500
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:03,738
Sounds like we could be fine
if our exposure is limited to hours.

501
01:21:03,739 --> 01:21:06,325
Well, let's find a way out quick then.

502
01:21:07,534 --> 01:21:08,410
What?

503
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:10,954
Maybe a way out.

504
01:21:19,588 --> 01:21:21,507
That's not from the 1940s.

505
01:21:22,174 --> 01:21:23,217
Late 2000s.

506
01:21:24,718 --> 01:21:26,677
Why not just send in a bomber squadron?

507
01:21:26,678 --> 01:21:28,764
Erase this whole mess and call it a day.

508
01:21:30,891 --> 01:21:33,143
"Darklake." Paramilitary.

509
01:21:34,102 --> 01:21:35,269
They haven't bombed the Gorge

510
01:21:35,270 --> 01:21:37,189
because they're still studying
what's in it.

511
01:21:38,899 --> 01:21:40,776
We're not working for the military.

512
01:21:45,322 --> 01:21:47,491
They used all this
to set up their research drones.

513
01:21:48,784 --> 01:21:52,621
Darklake is a huge corporation
specializing in genetic research.

514
01:21:54,706 --> 01:21:57,501
Their drones are collecting
hybrid DNA samples.

515
01:21:58,460 --> 01:22:00,128
They're building super soldiers.

516
01:22:01,046 --> 01:22:02,840
That's the mother of all secrets.

517
01:22:03,507 --> 01:22:06,175
Young soldiers and scientists
studied like suffering lab rats.

518
01:22:06,176 --> 01:22:08,678
Private defense contractors
have been researching

519
01:22:08,679 --> 01:22:11,265
genetic soldier enhancement for decades,

520
01:22:12,015 --> 01:22:14,059
and everything down here
is genetically brand-new.

521
01:22:15,561 --> 01:22:17,479
We're here to protect their secrets.

522
01:23:01,481 --> 01:23:04,067
Before we head out,
I need to say something to you.

523
01:23:04,693 --> 01:23:06,068
Let me guess.

524
01:23:06,069 --> 01:23:07,196
It's your poem?

525
01:23:08,405 --> 01:23:10,073
No, it's not my poem.

526
01:23:13,202 --> 01:23:16,954
If something happens,
and we don't make it out of here,

527
01:23:16,955 --> 01:23:19,833
and this is the way the world ends,
for us anyway,

528
01:23:21,418 --> 01:23:22,878
to me it was worth it

529
01:23:24,129 --> 01:23:25,589
because I got to know you.

530
01:23:26,507 --> 01:23:27,883
It wasn't easy,

531
01:23:28,967 --> 01:23:30,511
getting to know each other.

532
01:23:31,011 --> 01:23:32,012
No, it wasn't.

533
01:23:43,023 --> 01:23:44,274
You ready for this?

534
01:23:46,777 --> 01:23:48,237
We go strong.

535
01:23:55,953 --> 01:23:59,248
My gear pack.
I left it here. It has all the ammo in it.

536
01:24:06,046 --> 01:24:08,090
These things can think tactically.

537
01:24:23,397 --> 01:24:24,982
They're playing with us.

538
01:24:25,607 --> 01:24:27,526
They know we can't see a thing.

539
01:24:31,405 --> 01:24:32,948
Let's make it mutual.

540
01:25:26,293 --> 01:25:27,628
Drasa!

541
01:26:45,706 --> 01:26:48,208
Drasa!

542
01:27:32,669 --> 01:27:37,299
I'm going to cut
what's left of your ugly face off.

543
01:29:22,362 --> 01:29:23,447
Are you okay?

544
01:29:25,741 --> 01:29:27,534
- I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Yeah.

545
01:29:33,665 --> 01:29:35,292
"B. Shaw."

546
01:29:36,585 --> 01:29:37,669
Bradford.

547
01:29:40,756 --> 01:29:43,050
He was the first soldier
in the West Tower.

548
01:29:44,510 --> 01:29:46,345
He named the Hollow Men.

549
01:29:51,475 --> 01:29:52,309
Levi.

550
01:29:57,231 --> 01:29:58,315
Where are we?

551
01:30:07,449 --> 01:30:09,617
We're in a chemical missile facility.

552
01:30:09,618 --> 01:30:11,619
I came down a missile silo.

553
01:30:11,620 --> 01:30:13,247
They're the only way out.

554
01:30:25,926 --> 01:30:29,179
The earthquake damaged the missiles,
and they started leaking.

555
01:30:32,057 --> 01:30:34,309
The contaminant is in the fog.

556
01:33:46,293 --> 01:33:47,878
I know how we're getting out of here.

557
01:33:48,378 --> 01:33:50,505
These old jeeps have powerful winches.

558
01:33:50,506 --> 01:33:52,508
It'll work just like an auto ascender.

559
01:34:30,420 --> 01:34:31,963
Head to the eastern wall.

560
01:34:31,964 --> 01:34:33,549
The zip line should be close.

561
01:34:36,593 --> 01:34:38,262
There. That's it.

562
01:35:03,996 --> 01:35:05,289
I'm out.

563
01:36:01,803 --> 01:36:03,180
Levi.

564
01:36:10,979 --> 01:36:11,980
Levi!

565
01:36:22,741 --> 01:36:23,659
Toolbox.

566
01:37:22,718 --> 01:37:23,844
No!

567
01:37:28,515 --> 01:37:29,349
The propane!

568
01:38:12,518 --> 01:38:13,852
Cut the rope.

569
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:15,521
Levi.

570
01:38:45,217 --> 01:38:46,760
It was so surreal down there.

571
01:38:48,929 --> 01:38:50,931
Like a waking nightmare.

572
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:55,894
That's as close to hell
as I ever want to get.

573
01:38:58,272 --> 01:39:00,065
We'll need to quarantine.

574
01:39:02,359 --> 01:39:03,443
Five days.

575
01:39:08,365 --> 01:39:09,783
What if we're infected?

576
01:39:12,578 --> 01:39:14,371
I'll do what's necessary.

577
01:39:19,835 --> 01:39:20,878
Same.

578
01:39:22,504 --> 01:39:24,339
I have radio check tomorrow.

579
01:39:25,132 --> 01:39:26,091
Same.

580
01:39:26,967 --> 01:39:29,553
I don't know how
I'm supposed to get back across.

581
01:39:30,053 --> 01:39:32,389
There's a C19 grappling gun in the back.

582
01:39:33,974 --> 01:39:35,184
That should do it.

583
01:39:36,059 --> 01:39:38,769
Well, I guess
the Russians stock a better armory.

584
01:39:38,770 --> 01:39:41,815
They also make better vodka.

585
01:39:42,733 --> 01:39:43,734
Here.

586
01:39:45,152 --> 01:39:47,237
To making it out alive.

587
01:39:56,079 --> 01:39:58,248
Do you know why I even got this job?

588
01:39:58,790 --> 01:40:01,043
Because of that impossible shot
you made in Yemen?

589
01:40:02,419 --> 01:40:04,546
No, I wasn't lying about that.

590
01:40:05,297 --> 01:40:06,631
I didn't make that shot.

591
01:40:06,632 --> 01:40:07,841
I know.

592
01:40:08,342 --> 01:40:10,260
I know exactly who made that shot.

593
01:40:13,347 --> 01:40:14,598
Why did you get the job?

594
01:40:16,850 --> 01:40:19,436
They chose me because I was expendable.

595
01:40:20,312 --> 01:40:21,563
Expendable?

596
01:40:22,523 --> 01:40:23,774
No attachments.

597
01:40:24,274 --> 01:40:26,944
No one to miss me if I disappeared.

598
01:40:29,029 --> 01:40:31,365
Nothing to live for
except the next mission.

599
01:40:34,576 --> 01:40:36,328
But now it's all flipped.

600
01:40:38,205 --> 01:40:40,290
And I have everything to live for.

601
01:40:45,254 --> 01:40:46,380
We could run.

602
01:40:47,047 --> 01:40:50,467
I know a place in France,
and we could be safe there.

603
01:40:50,968 --> 01:40:52,427
For as long as we want.

604
01:40:53,220 --> 01:40:58,599
Drasa, I want to leave with you
more than anything in the world.

605
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:00,643
But what about this place?

606
01:41:00,644 --> 01:41:03,271
What about the next pair of soldiers
that they bring in here,

607
01:41:03,272 --> 01:41:06,817
and inherit their secrets, and their lies?

608
01:41:09,319 --> 01:41:11,697
And every Hollow Man is a contaminant.

609
01:41:12,406 --> 01:41:13,866
So if one of them gets out...

610
01:41:18,412 --> 01:41:20,247
We need to destroy the Gorge.

611
01:41:28,130 --> 01:41:31,757
Remember,
mutations will appear within five days.

612
01:41:31,758 --> 01:41:35,094
So, if we make it to day six,
we're in the clear.

613
01:41:35,095 --> 01:41:37,180
- But if not...
- If not, we're dead.

614
01:41:37,181 --> 01:41:40,058
But if we're clear, we meet up next week.

615
01:41:42,019 --> 01:41:43,020
We go strong.

616
01:41:43,604 --> 01:41:45,606
- Yes?
- Always.

617
01:41:49,026 --> 01:41:51,069
- Lis...
- Don't say good-bye.

618
01:41:52,571 --> 01:41:54,113
I don't want to hear you say that.

619
01:41:54,114 --> 01:41:55,656
I wasn't going to say good-bye.

620
01:41:55,657 --> 01:41:58,702
Okay. And what were you gonna say?

621
01:42:07,586 --> 01:42:08,879
That I love you.

622
01:42:15,260 --> 01:42:18,013
This is West Tower performing radio check.
Do you copy?

623
01:42:19,473 --> 01:42:21,474
I repeat, this is West Tower
performing radio check.

624
01:42:21,475 --> 01:42:23,392
Do you copy? Over.

625
01:42:23,393 --> 01:42:24,853
Authentication code?

626
01:42:25,812 --> 01:42:27,980
Delta, Theta, four, one, Omega.

627
01:42:27,981 --> 01:42:29,191
Stand by.

628
01:42:30,943 --> 01:42:34,363
Levi? Do you know who this is?

629
01:42:36,657 --> 01:42:37,990
Yes.

630
01:42:37,991 --> 01:42:41,370
Our research drone computer system
was activated.

631
01:42:42,412 --> 01:42:44,248
Did you go into the Gorge?

632
01:42:44,998 --> 01:42:48,794
Negative. But I did see
one of your drones fly out of here.

633
01:42:49,336 --> 01:42:51,672
Seems like you're not a spook after all.

634
01:42:52,965 --> 01:42:54,465
The private sector is where

635
01:42:54,466 --> 01:42:58,095
the most important scientific progress
happens these days.

636
01:42:58,679 --> 01:43:01,347
Do you know what kind of work I do here?

637
01:43:01,348 --> 01:43:03,350
I'm assuming the kind that pays well.

638
01:43:03,934 --> 01:43:06,561
Let's just say the primary aim
of our research

639
01:43:06,562 --> 01:43:09,522
is to make American ground forces
unbeatable

640
01:43:09,523 --> 01:43:12,567
against any foreign army in the world.

641
01:43:12,568 --> 01:43:16,113
I'm sure you can appreciate what
we could do with a military like that.

642
01:43:17,906 --> 01:43:19,116
Absolutely.

643
01:43:21,577 --> 01:43:27,541
Levi, have you noticed any movement
from your eastern counterpart?

644
01:43:31,670 --> 01:43:32,671
Negative.

645
01:43:33,297 --> 01:43:37,426
Because if it wasn't you that activated
our computer system in the Gorge,

646
01:43:38,010 --> 01:43:40,637
I have to assume
that it was your eastern counterpart.

647
01:43:42,347 --> 01:43:45,601
There are, after all,
only the two of you there.

648
01:43:48,228 --> 01:43:50,772
You are to neutralize your counterpart.

649
01:43:52,733 --> 01:43:54,151
Immediately.

650
01:43:55,152 --> 01:43:56,612
Do you understand?

651
01:43:58,363 --> 01:43:59,906
Consider it done.

652
01:43:59,907 --> 01:44:03,243
Copy that. Thank you, Levi.

653
01:44:23,722 --> 01:44:27,808
Commander, Levi Kane is compromised.

654
01:44:27,809 --> 01:44:30,228
Gather your team.
We'll leave in the morning.

655
01:44:30,229 --> 01:44:32,146
You're coming with us, ma'am?

656
01:44:32,147 --> 01:44:33,732
He's my mistake.

657
01:44:34,608 --> 01:44:37,027
I'll kill him myself if I have to.

658
01:46:00,235 --> 01:46:01,486
Run!

659
01:46:34,686 --> 01:46:37,104
There's no sign of Levi Kane
anywhere in the tower

660
01:46:37,105 --> 01:46:39,148
or on the surrounding compound.

661
01:46:39,149 --> 01:46:40,859
What if he decided to run?

662
01:46:43,737 --> 01:46:45,196
Raise the quadcopters.

663
01:46:45,197 --> 01:46:47,406
There's no sign of the counterpart either.

664
01:46:47,407 --> 01:46:50,452
If Levi didn't keep his post,
why believe that he would have killed her?

665
01:46:52,454 --> 01:46:53,622
Split them up.

666
01:46:54,122 --> 01:46:56,667
Drone protocol, quadcopters, verification...

667
01:49:25,816 --> 01:49:27,734
Commander, what's that on the wall?

668
01:49:56,430 --> 01:49:59,433
"Three things cannot be long hidden:

669
01:50:00,225 --> 01:50:04,771
the sun, the moon and the truth.

670
01:50:06,273 --> 01:50:07,191
Buddha.

671
01:50:09,568 --> 01:50:11,028
Levi Kane."

672
01:50:45,354 --> 01:50:46,772
What the hell was that?

673
01:51:08,585 --> 01:51:12,381
The cloakers. He's rigged the cloakers.

674
01:51:15,759 --> 01:51:17,135
The Gorge is exposed.

675
01:51:26,520 --> 01:51:27,980
Straydog.

676
01:51:30,107 --> 01:51:31,483
We have two minutes.

677
01:51:37,281 --> 01:51:39,408
Prepare for immediate takeoff.

678
01:51:54,840 --> 01:51:56,884
Get us airborne. Now!

679
01:52:17,821 --> 01:52:20,949
Forget altitude! We need distance!

680
01:52:43,555 --> 01:52:45,057
Fast!

681
01:56:53,305 --> 01:56:54,680
Hello, Drasa.

682
01:56:54,681 --> 01:56:57,768
Hello, Levi. You're late.

683
01:56:58,727 --> 01:57:01,854
Sorry. I got injured at my old job.

684
01:57:01,855 --> 01:57:05,316
Well, if you're looking for a new one,
the kitchen's hiring.

685
01:57:05,317 --> 01:57:06,735
Got any special skills?

686
01:57:08,237 --> 01:57:09,487
I'm a pretty good shot.

687
01:57:09,488 --> 01:57:10,863
How good?

688
01:57:10,864 --> 01:57:12,824
Last one was 3,900 meters.

689
01:57:13,617 --> 01:57:15,410
Had to beat my record.

690
01:57:17,037 --> 01:57:18,497
I had to get back to you.
