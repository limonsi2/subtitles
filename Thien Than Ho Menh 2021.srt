<i>I may be crying but I'm not weak</i>

00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,750
A, HOT GIRL LY COCO IS BACK!

<i>Nobody understands women</i>

7
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,250
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN I MISS YOU SO MUCH

00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:02,083
<i>Don't think</i>
<i>You'll ever have us figured out</i>

9
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,833
Hello, everyone!

10
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,250
SHE IS SO BEAUTIFUL JUST LIKE HER VOICE!

11
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,625
LY,
WHY HAVEN'T YOU BEEN TO SCHOOL RECENTLY?

12
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,458
What are you doing, Ly?

13
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:23,375
Sorry, folks.
That's my roommate, her name is…

14
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,958
I'm Huyen. I'm Ly's manager.

15
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:29,708
If you want to get to Ly,
you'll have to go through me first.

16
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:33,375
Somebody is asking…
What if I want to introduce a boyfriend?

17
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:36,708
Of course,
I'd have to check him out first.

18
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:39,666
If he turns out to be a good catch…
I'll keep him for myself!

19
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:45,125
Oh no! I'm late for class.

20
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:49,041
Bye, everyone,
we'll livestream again tonight.

21
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,750
I'm going to class with you today.

22
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,833
Wow. Livestreaming and going to class?

23
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,375
So you're done
moping over your broken heart?

24
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:01,625
It's been two months already.

25
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,583
There's no use sitting around crying.

26
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:06,291
My dad would kill me
if he knew I skipped out on school.

27
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,125
So have you been able to reach Phuong?

28
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,958
Her phone is still off.

29
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:17,833
What are you doing?

30
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,500
Water's shut off.
You didn't pay the bill did you?

31
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,083
Here's the water bill.

32
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:31,958
Don't tell me you didn't
pay the electricity bill either.

33
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:37,208
Where's the electricity money?

34
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:25,041
Are you done admiring yourself?

35
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:28,125
It's so sad, I've been trying to
find a bad angle but there isn't one.

36
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,250
Hey Ly, have you heard?

37
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,291
How was Phuong the last time you saw her?

38
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:47,041
Damn, it was just a sex clip.
Why kill yourself over that?

39
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:55,750
SINGER LAM PHUONG DIED OF SUICIDE
AT AGE 25

40
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,083
Ly, where are you going?

41
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:06,958
{\an8}<i>The body of singer Lam Phuong</i>
<i>was found last night in her home.</i>

42
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,083
{\an8}<i>Preliminary investigations</i>
<i>point to suicide,</i>

43
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:12,833
{\an8}<i>just days after a sexually graphic video</i>
<i>of her was leaked on social media,</i>

44
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:15,041
{\an8}<i>leading to a wave of boycott from fans.</i>

45
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:19,291
<i>The clip going viral</i>
<i>also shows three other men with Phuong</i>

46
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,958
<i>but none of them have been identified.</i>

47
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,291
<i>As the only heir</i>
<i>to Alpha Group corporation,</i>

48
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,625
{\an8}<i>Lam Phuong did not follow</i>
<i>her father's footsteps,</i>

49
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:29,833
{\an8}<i>but instead chose the music industry</i>
<i>and found her own success.</i>

50
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:33,708
<i>Her educational and family background,</i>
<i>as well as a private life free of scandal,</i>

51
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:38,208
<i>had vaulted her into being</i>
<i>the princess of the music industry,</i>

52
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
{\an8}<i>which was why the leaked video</i>
<i>came as a shock to many.</i>

53
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:46,000
<i>Moreover, the discovery of a Kumanthong</i>
<i>doll at the scene of her death</i>

54
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:50,500
<i>has spread rumors of</i>
<i>voodoo and superstition.</i>

55
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,041
Dad!

56
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,500
<i>Why are you not at school?</i>

57
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,333
I miss you.

58
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:24,416
Oh, please.

59
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,083
You should quit drinking.

60
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:31,833
Don't change the subject.

61
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,000
Be honest.

62
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,125
Some boy break your heart?

63
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,250
Good grief, no!

64
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:41,875
Are you pregnant?

65
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,083
What are you on about?

66
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,333
I'm just worried, that's all.

67
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,916
Study well and find a good job, don't
be like your good-for-nothing mother.

68
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,750
All that singing and fame nonsense
got to her head and ruined her life.

69
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,083
What's wrong with singing?

70
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,250
Everything's wrong with singing!

71
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:05,208
The way those damn singers dress,
they might as well be naked.

72
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,541
Just a bunch of drug addicts!

73
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:15,750
Yes, Dad.

74
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,458
-Hello.
-Are you looking for someone?

75
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:41,000
Is this the home of Nguyen Mai Ly?

76
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,833
Yes, I'm her father.

77
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:45,708
I'm Detective Manh.

78
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:49,208
We need to ask Ly some questions
about Lam Phuong's suicide.

79
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,666
Your daughter was
a back-up singer for Lam Phuong.

80
00:10:58,958 --> 00:10:59,916
Is that true?

81
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,208
Yes.

82
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,583
Please calm down.

83
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,208
I told you a thousand times,

84
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:13,458
there would be none of
that singing bullshit in this house!

85
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:17,416
We just need her help
in our investigation.

86
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,291
You can come with us if you want.

87
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,750
Get her out of my sight.

88
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,583
<i>The clip seems</i>
<i>to have been recorded at a party.</i>

89
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:48,041
What do you know about it?

90
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:51,208
I don't know anything.

91
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:54,458
I was just her back-up singer.

92
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,833
But Khanh, her manager, said otherwise.

93
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,958
According to
one of Phuong's text messages,

94
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,458
you went to the party with her.

95
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:21,500
Phuong's suicide note: who's "all of you"?

96
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,041
Recognize this?

97
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:37,291
Yuki. Phuong's doll.

98
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,125
She loved it.

99
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,083
It was her guardian angel.

100
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:46,166
Not a very reliable guardian angel then.

101
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,541
Didn't seem to help you either.

102
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,125
You have one too.

103
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,041
And they look like
they were bought from the same place.

104
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:03,500
No, that's not true.
I bought mine at the market.

105
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,416
Kumanthong dolls, they all look similar.

106
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,833
<i>I may be smiling but I'm not happy</i>

107
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:38,083
Cash up front, that's why
everyone loves working with this team.

108
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,500
Phuong's new album is coming out soon.

109
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:40,750
Try to make rehearsals, okay?

110
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,041
Yeah, I know.

111
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,250
Khanh,

112
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,000
you gave me extra.

113
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,875
Phuong asked me to.

114
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:54,750
Time to pay rent, right?

115
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:58,541
I work the same as everyone else,
so I shouldn't receive more.

116
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,000
I feel awkward.

117
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,416
No need to feel bad.
You two are like sisters.

118
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:09,375
So?
What did you think about my performance?

119
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,666
Same as usual.

120
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,625
Same as usual?

121
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:17,875
Not ground breaking? Not mesmerizing?

122
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:21,125
No, what I meant is
your usual is already the best.

123
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,958
Because I have the best manager!

124
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,833
And, of course, my little Yuki!

125
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:33,708
I think ever since you got Yuki,
you've had non-stop hits.

126
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,583
Be careful, someone may get jealous.

127
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:38,000
Sure, Yuki handles all the bookings,
right?

128
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,916
Yuki schedules the band,

129
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,208
Yuki places the ads,
Yuki butters up the reporters too.

130
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,458
See?

131
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,541
I adore Yuki but I love you.

132
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,875
Let's go, I'm starving.

133
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,958
Go get changed while I get the car.

134
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,458
-Hey, Ly!
-Yes?

135
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:10,166
Your birthday's coming up, right?

136
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:13,041
-What's this?
-Open it.

137
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,250
I love it. Thank you.

138
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:22,666
Take care of her,
she'll bring you good luck.

139
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,750
I will.

140
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:26,833
<i>Ly,</i>

141
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:31,166
if you don't tell us what you know,

142
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,333
I'm afraid more people will get hurt.

143
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,000
<i>Phuong, let's update story.</i>

144
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,250
<i>-Have you applied a filter?</i>
<i>-Of course. Now pose!</i>

145
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:30,666
What happened?

146
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,541
There's blood… in the bathroom.

147
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,500
Are you okay? There's no blood.

148
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,375
Rest in peace…

149
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,333
Phuong.

150
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:26,541
-Are you Ly?
-Yes.

151
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,375
I'm Phuong's dad.

152
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:30,708
The police met with me.

153
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:36,458
I know you were
there with her at that party.

154
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:41,666
You told them you don't remember
anything about that night.

155
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:49,916
We were drugged,
I really can't remember anything.

156
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,041
Tell me the truth, did they threaten you?

157
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:58,125
It's over, I just want to move on.

158
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:02,041
I think Phuong would want the same too.

159
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:04,208
Don't you want them to get punished?

160
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,666
-I said everything I needed to say.
-Nothing but lies!

161
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,083
Look at Phuong.

162
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:18,000
She was only 25, successful and talented…

163
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:21,875
why would she dabble in drugs
and those kind of parties?

164
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,041
I don't think
you know everything about her.

165
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:32,750
She wasn't as strong as she looked.

166
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:37,458
She kept a Kumanthong doll
because she yearned for a mother's love.

167
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:38,541
What did you say?

168
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,875
Her mother left when
she was very young, right?

169
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,083
Shut up!

170
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,750
You don't know anything about our family.

171
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:52,250
I'm a victim too.

172
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,625
I'm in pain too.

173
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,708
I'm sorry, I have to go.

174
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,375
You have to help me,

175
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,541
you have to help me clear her name.

176
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:14,250
I'm sorry.

177
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:30,666
Hello?

178
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,750
<i>You have fun talking to Mr. Ngọc?</i>

179
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,333
Who is this?

180
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:41,541
<i>If you don't want to end up like Phuong,</i>
<i>watch your mouth.</i>

181
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,541
<i>We're following you.</i>

182
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:04,958
SIX MONTHS LATER

183
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,791
ACOUSTIC COMPETITION

184
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:45,916
Look here.

185
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:49,541
You have to show off a little more
like this to get an audience.

186
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:50,625
Unlike you.

187
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:53,208
No, thanks.

188
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:57,083
Try it. Who knows,
maybe you'll get a million views!

189
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:58,375
Leave her alone.

190
00:22:58,458 --> 00:23:01,666
Ly can actually sing,
she doesn't need tricks.

191
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,166
No need to strip if you got the gifts.

192
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:08,416
Hey that almost rhymes.
You should be a rapper.

193
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:13,625
There's that singing contest
that's been running ads like crazy.

194
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:17,833
Yeah, I only have a few hundred friends
and their ads still pop up on my page.

195
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:19,208
Yeah.

196
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:24,875
Here it is.

197
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:29,500
The finals will livestream on YouTube.

198
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:30,958
Sounds like a big deal.

199
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:32,958
Ly can win this easily.

200
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:36,916
Yeah, you'll be so famous if you win.

201
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,125
Give me some of
that reward money so I can pay the bills.

202
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:48,250
SING FOR YOU COMPETITION

203
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:48,000
You're so going to win.

204
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:50,166
For sure.

205
00:25:07,666 --> 00:25:10,083
And the winner is…

206
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:12,291
Tram Anh!

207
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,458
Please come up to the stage, Tram Anh.

208
00:25:16,541 --> 00:25:18,625
Will our sponsors please join us on stage.

209
00:25:20,458 --> 00:25:22,291
Congratulations to our winner.

210
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,708
Hey, did she bribe somebody?

211
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:29,375
Her voice isn't even
suitable for busking on the street.

212
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,708
Oh, well… that's my life.

213
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,375
You did very well.

214
00:25:38,791 --> 00:25:40,166
Thank you.

215
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,958
If it were up to me,
you would have been the winner.

216
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,916
Can we change the rules of the game?

217
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,833
There should be a second prize
or consolation prize.

218
00:25:49,416 --> 00:25:51,750
Have some self-respect, would you?

219
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:53,750
Water’s been off for three days now.

220
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:55,458
I need to shower real bad.

221
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:00,458
What’s her name?

222
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:02,791
Little Ly.

223
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,916
Wow. Yeah!

224
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,416
-Look at this.
-Please, enjoy.

225
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:15,041
Can’t remember the last time
we got to eat this well!

226
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:17,708
Can I have the cash equivalent
of this meal?

227
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:19,166
Shush!

228
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:21,416
Eat and stop talking.

229
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:29,541
Where did you summon Little Ly?

230
00:26:29,625 --> 00:26:30,583
What do you mean?

231
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,291
I got her as a birthday gift.

232
00:26:36,375 --> 00:26:37,541
And did you do the summoning?

233
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:38,750
What summoning?

234
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:42,666
You kids really don’t know anything.

235
00:26:43,375 --> 00:26:46,791
For Kumanthong dolls,
you have to go to the right master.

236
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:51,375
He will decide who’s most suitable for you

237
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:52,916
and bless the doll.

238
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,708
If you don’t do it right,
it will backfire on you.

239
00:26:59,708 --> 00:27:03,833
I've never really thought about that.

240
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:06,958
You know Lam Phuong the singer?

241
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:10,416
Her voice was just so-so,

242
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:15,125
so why did she become an idol?

243
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:16,666
Because of Kumanthong.

244
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:21,916
But Kumanthong didn’t protect her, did it?

245
00:27:24,958 --> 00:27:28,333
You have to understand,
the doll is just the shell.

246
00:27:28,416 --> 00:27:31,333
What's most important
is the soul of the baby inside.

247
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:35,500
How you treat it
decides how your life turns out.

248
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:42,166
You were the best singer tonight,

249
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:45,333
you lost to the winner by only two votes.

250
00:27:45,416 --> 00:27:50,625
I think you have the look,
you have the voice.

251
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:52,958
But I’ve never
heard of you before tonight,

252
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:55,500
which means
your doll is not working right now.

253
00:27:58,666 --> 00:28:04,083
My master, he comes
to Vietnam every month.

254
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:08,083
Look. Ask him to summon a doll for you.

255
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:11,166
It'll be the best investment of your life.

256
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:14,375
Just think about it and let me know.

257
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:16,708
I’ll show you the real master.

258
00:28:16,791 --> 00:28:18,916
There are all kinds
of charlatans out there.

259
00:28:21,125 --> 00:28:22,041
Okay.

260
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:32,875
Mrs. Tam is right.

261
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:35,666
Little Ly is cute,
but she’s never been blessed.

262
00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:40,125
Ever since I got her,
all I've had is bad luck.

263
00:28:40,208 --> 00:28:42,708
No job, no boyfriend.

264
00:28:42,791 --> 00:28:44,250
You're nuts.

265
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:46,708
I'm this good looking
and I still don't have a boyfriend!

266
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:53,625
Mrs. Tam said ever since
she got the Kumanthong,

267
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:56,625
everything worked out for her.

268
00:28:56,708 --> 00:28:57,625
Don't be stupid!

269
00:28:57,708 --> 00:29:01,708
She's always been crazy rich.
And you’ll be famous in no time.

270
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:06,958
You don't need any guardian angels…
you have one right next to you.

271
00:29:07,041 --> 00:29:08,125
That's me!

272
00:29:13,541 --> 00:29:16,083
This is going to be
the best investment of my life.

273
00:29:16,166 --> 00:29:19,166
When I’m rich and famous,

274
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:22,250
I will supply you with
a lifetime of sushi and boba tea.

275
00:29:23,833 --> 00:29:25,583
Nah. I’m just a ramen kind of girl.

276
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:30,083
How about a year supply of Vifon ramen?

277
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:35,666
Cheers.

278
00:30:39,916 --> 00:30:42,625
Whoa! Why so many dolls?

279
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:44,916
Looks more like the Nguyen dynasty.

280
00:30:45,708 --> 00:30:46,833
They’re pretty cute.

281
00:30:46,916 --> 00:30:48,125
Oh, please.

282
00:30:48,208 --> 00:30:50,416
Barbies are cute.

283
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,583
These look more like
descendants of Annabelle.

284
00:30:53,666 --> 00:30:56,041
Shush. Be serious.

285
00:30:56,125 --> 00:30:57,916
I'm being dead serious.

286
00:31:49,166 --> 00:31:52,291
Why does she look like Yuki?

287
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:53,708
Who?

288
00:31:54,291 --> 00:31:57,000
Yuki, Phuong’s doll.

289
00:31:57,083 --> 00:32:00,375
The accessories, the aura.
Exactly the same.

290
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:03,875
Aura of a doll?

291
00:32:33,416 --> 00:32:35,416
I'm going to call you Na.

292
00:32:36,333 --> 00:32:39,125
I'm going to be your mommy from now on.

293
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,375
I'm going to love you
like my own flesh and blood.

294
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:56,708
So cute.

295
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:00,791
Yeah, cute.

296
00:33:03,708 --> 00:33:05,000
Hey.

297
00:33:05,708 --> 00:33:07,333
That looks like Khanh.

298
00:33:07,958 --> 00:33:09,375
Khanh who?

299
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:12,500
Khanh the producer, Phuong’s boyfriend.

300
00:33:12,583 --> 00:33:15,916
The one you had a crush on?

301
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:17,666
Keep it down.

302
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:21,125
Don’t get your panties in a twist.

303
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,708
Shit. He saw us.

304
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:29,125
Hey, Khanh! Ly's hiding right behind me!

305
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:30,791
You!

306
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:36,291
Ly. Long time no see.

307
00:33:37,291 --> 00:33:39,875
I’m Huyen, her manager.

308
00:33:43,833 --> 00:33:44,875
What have you been up to?

309
00:33:44,958 --> 00:33:45,833
Me?

310
00:33:45,916 --> 00:33:49,083
I'm still going to school.

311
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:52,791
My office just moved to District 1,
stop by some time if you want.

312
00:33:53,625 --> 00:33:55,208
I have a few projects coming up.

313
00:33:55,791 --> 00:33:58,083
We’ll definitely be there.

314
00:33:58,166 --> 00:34:00,500
Make sure you line up the reporters,

315
00:34:00,583 --> 00:34:02,416
we can only spare five minutes.

316
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:07,291
I’ll roll out the red carpet for you both.

317
00:34:08,458 --> 00:34:09,666
Bye.

318
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,000
Goodbye.

319
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:15,125
Why did he give me this?

320
00:34:15,208 --> 00:34:16,375
What?

321
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,875
He didn’t have to.

322
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:21,541
Why did he suddenly
invite me to sing for him?

323
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:24,625
Oh, that’s just chit chat.

324
00:34:24,708 --> 00:34:26,666
You'll audition

325
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:30,208
and he’ll say, "Oh you’re very good
but oh, I'm so sorry."

326
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:32,125
Then he'll make you a back-up singer.

327
00:34:33,041 --> 00:34:34,083
He’s in need of back-up singers, you know.

328
00:34:35,166 --> 00:34:36,500
That's not what I meant.

329
00:34:36,583 --> 00:34:39,208
In a city this big, how could
we run into each other by chance?

330
00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:41,291
It's good luck, don’t you see?

331
00:34:41,375 --> 00:34:42,916
What the hell?

332
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,625
I'm serious.

333
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:48,500
He never paid any attention to me before.

334
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,708
It must be for my baby Na.

335
00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:54,666
He looked at me differently today.

336
00:35:05,791 --> 00:35:09,583
<i>It’s two a.m. at the intersection</i>

337
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:14,625
<i>We sit side by side watching the city</i>

338
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,083
<i>There is a storm inside me</i>

339
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:29,041
<i>You ask me what you should do</i>

340
00:35:30,416 --> 00:35:34,125
<i>When the one you love is gone</i>

341
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:39,166
<i>Stealing your heart without a word</i>

342
00:35:43,791 --> 00:35:45,375
<i>Why can’t you see?</i>

343
00:35:45,958 --> 00:35:50,291
<i>Day by day, the one next to you</i>

344
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:57,083
<i>Can't make you feel the way I do</i>

345
00:35:57,166 --> 00:36:04,125
<i>Why are you in such a hurry?</i>
<i>I am the one who loves you</i>

346
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,625
Your vocal range is impressive.

347
00:36:13,541 --> 00:36:15,791
It’s hard to believe you
didn’t have any professional training.

348
00:36:16,916 --> 00:36:20,666
I’ve loved singing since I was a kid.

349
00:36:21,291 --> 00:36:22,875
My mom used to be a singer,

350
00:36:23,666 --> 00:36:25,333
just a bar singer,

351
00:36:25,958 --> 00:36:29,708
but she was very good, and very pretty.

352
00:36:30,291 --> 00:36:33,416
Why didn’t you go to music school?

353
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,333
My mom left my dad when I was young.

354
00:36:36,958 --> 00:36:39,791
She was so into singing that
she followed the other man.

355
00:36:39,875 --> 00:36:43,291
If he knew I was involved with singing,
he would be so mad.

356
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:55,416
After Phuong passed away,
the company slowed down too.

357
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:58,416
I still can’t believe it.

358
00:37:00,125 --> 00:37:01,833
She was my idol.

359
00:37:05,583 --> 00:37:07,333
You just lost an idol.

360
00:37:09,916 --> 00:37:11,916
I lost a fiancée,

361
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:14,750
a soulmate,

362
00:37:15,458 --> 00:37:17,333
a partner,

363
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:22,000
the future of our company.

364
00:37:24,166 --> 00:37:25,166
Khanh,

365
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:30,583
you're the best producer in town,
you can build it up again.

366
00:37:38,333 --> 00:37:40,208
We're drinking in the middle of the day?

367
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:43,666
Just one glass.

368
00:37:46,541 --> 00:37:47,750
To celebrate our company’s new talent.

369
00:37:49,458 --> 00:37:51,083
Are you serious?

370
00:37:51,166 --> 00:37:52,166
Very serious.

371
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:54,833
We're going to make you a star in no time.

372
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:47,625
This will be your new home.

373
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,375
This is Ms. Nam,

374
00:38:57,458 --> 00:39:00,250
she'll take care of things
around the house.

375
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:01,875
I hope you like it.

376
00:39:02,458 --> 00:39:03,875
Thank you!

377
00:39:41,625 --> 00:39:42,708
Baby Na.

378
00:39:43,666 --> 00:39:46,958
Thank you for bringing me
all these great opportunities.

379
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:51,500
I know you listened to all my prayers.

380
00:39:51,583 --> 00:39:54,791
I promise to love you
and take care of you forever.

381
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,666
I love you too, Mommy.

382
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,375
Hello, kids.

383
00:40:13,833 --> 00:40:15,833
-Hi.
-Hello, auntie!

384
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:17,625
I mean, hello sis!

385
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,625
We just got started. Come on in.

386
00:40:20,708 --> 00:40:21,541
Okay.

387
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:27,333
Hi, everyone.

388
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:31,333
This is baby Na and her mommy, Mai Ly,

389
00:40:31,416 --> 00:40:33,500
our newest members.

390
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,875
Baby Na!
Say hi to all the aunties and uncles.

391
00:40:41,958 --> 00:40:44,250
Hi, Na.

392
00:40:48,916 --> 00:40:50,583
Happy birthday to Phuc.

393
00:40:51,375 --> 00:40:54,583
This is lovely.

394
00:40:54,666 --> 00:40:58,750
Phuc is saying thank you to auntie Ly.

395
00:40:58,833 --> 00:41:03,125
Phuc, say hi to Na. Hi Na! Look at that.

396
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:43,958
There. You can now take pictures
or videos if you want.

397
00:41:45,958 --> 00:41:47,583
Hey, you.

398
00:41:47,666 --> 00:41:50,708
You just told me I could take pictures.

399
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:54,666
Just go do your thing. Go.

400
00:41:55,583 --> 00:41:56,500
-Hey, sis.
-Yes?

401
00:41:59,541 --> 00:42:01,500
Can I ask you something?

402
00:42:01,583 --> 00:42:02,625
Sure.

403
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:07,791
I'm just curious, when I pray to Na,

404
00:42:08,791 --> 00:42:10,666
can you ask for anything?

405
00:42:11,291 --> 00:42:14,458
Are there any limits?

406
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:17,583
What do you want to wish for?

407
00:42:19,875 --> 00:42:23,125
Career, fame.

408
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:24,250
Yes.

409
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,291
Fortune.

410
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Love.

411
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:34,750
What's so funny?

412
00:42:35,875 --> 00:42:37,375
Someone's in love!

413
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:00,791
Why aren't you eating?

414
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,375
You keep staring at me.

415
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,958
It's so cozy here.

416
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,750
Phuong used to love this place.

417
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,666
You don’t like the food?

418
00:43:35,708 --> 00:43:38,250
No, it’s… wonderful.

419
00:44:07,375 --> 00:44:08,458
Ly?

420
00:44:08,541 --> 00:44:10,041
Are you all right?

421
00:44:11,208 --> 00:44:14,458
I'm fine.

422
00:44:25,541 --> 00:44:27,000
Thank you.

423
00:44:28,125 --> 00:44:29,291
Ly?

424
00:44:30,208 --> 00:44:31,291
I'm sorry.

425
00:44:32,041 --> 00:44:32,875
It's okay.

426
00:45:01,458 --> 00:45:05,125
KHANH

427
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,041
Phuong used to love this place.

428
00:45:48,916 --> 00:45:51,458
This must be
the nicest studio in the city.

429
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:58,666
You know that Khanh
built this studio for Phuong, right?

430
00:45:59,583 --> 00:46:02,583
She recorded all her songs exactly
where you are standing right now.

431
00:47:48,916 --> 00:47:51,250
Are you ready? Let’s get started.

432
00:47:51,333 --> 00:47:53,166
Yeah, okay.

433
00:48:10,833 --> 00:48:16,583
Phuong left so suddenly.

434
00:48:17,291 --> 00:48:21,125
Recently, she's been appearing to me.

435
00:48:21,208 --> 00:48:23,833
I’m scared.

436
00:48:27,791 --> 00:48:33,125
I never wanted to hurt her.

437
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:36,083
I loved her.

438
00:48:46,333 --> 00:48:47,708
Don’t worry, Mommy.

439
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,333
She’s not upset with you.

440
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,416
You’re like her little sister.

441
00:49:11,625 --> 00:49:15,708
You’re really good
for someone who’s untrained.

442
00:49:16,916 --> 00:49:19,125
Thank you.

443
00:49:32,208 --> 00:49:33,458
Is it difficult to learn the piano?

444
00:49:35,333 --> 00:49:40,375
Sure, but someone like you
could probably learn faster than others.

445
00:49:40,458 --> 00:49:42,541
Sit down.

446
00:49:47,708 --> 00:49:50,333
The white keys are
the natural notes of each octave,

447
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:54,583
the black keys are half tones.

448
00:50:14,416 --> 00:50:17,208
During the time of Mozart,

449
00:50:18,416 --> 00:50:21,750
it was the opposite.

450
00:50:25,166 --> 00:50:27,666
I didn’t know that.

451
00:50:31,916 --> 00:50:32,750
Yes.

452
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:40,458
Some things that are white used to be
black and black used to be white.

453
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:44,875
Just like human nature.

454
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:50,208
You can’t tell
until you watch very closely.

455
00:50:55,916 --> 00:50:57,458
Focus.

456
00:50:57,541 --> 00:50:59,541
Play that melody again.

457
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,500
Phuong used to like this song.

458
00:51:35,875 --> 00:51:37,583
Do you know its name?

459
00:51:39,625 --> 00:51:42,000
-I…
-"Ah, vous dirai-je, maman."

460
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:44,458
Mozart's variation.

461
00:51:45,875 --> 00:51:48,750
Then they turned it
into a children’s song,

462
00:51:49,625 --> 00:51:55,291
and the original title meant
"Mother, if I could tell you."

463
00:51:58,416 --> 00:52:00,000
What would Phuong say to her mother?

464
00:52:01,541 --> 00:52:02,666
Khanh.

465
00:52:03,458 --> 00:52:10,250
I’m an addict… and a whore?

466
00:52:18,791 --> 00:52:20,083
Wow, I love it, thank you.

467
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:24,541
Take good care of her
and she’ll bring you good luck.

468
00:52:24,625 --> 00:52:25,708
I will.

469
00:52:33,833 --> 00:52:35,458
Cuong, did you call for me?

470
00:52:35,541 --> 00:52:38,666
Hello, Ly Coco! Have a drink!

471
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:40,583
I have class tomorrow.

472
00:52:40,666 --> 00:52:43,791
If you can't drink with me,
how about with him?

473
00:52:44,416 --> 00:52:45,708
Hello, Ly Coco.

474
00:52:46,291 --> 00:52:50,208
I’ve been listening to you on Instagram,
finally got a chance to hear you live.

475
00:52:50,916 --> 00:52:53,250
Thien, what a surprise to see you here.

476
00:52:54,541 --> 00:52:57,125
He’s known as the star maker.

477
00:52:57,208 --> 00:53:01,041
You get to sing a song of his
and you’ll be famous overnight.

478
00:53:01,125 --> 00:53:02,291
I don’t know what to say.

479
00:53:02,375 --> 00:53:04,541
Then you don't have to say anything,
just have a drink.

480
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:07,041
Here you go.

481
00:53:12,375 --> 00:53:13,250
Cheers.

482
00:53:18,333 --> 00:53:19,500
Look at you.

483
00:53:19,583 --> 00:53:22,333
Your voice still needs some polish

484
00:53:22,916 --> 00:53:26,083
but on certain notes,
you’re even better than Phuong.

485
00:53:27,083 --> 00:53:29,916
Come on, I’m just her back-up singer.

486
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:34,916
Mariah Carey, Pink, Cher, Gwen Stefani.

487
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,083
What do they all have in common?

488
00:53:37,375 --> 00:53:40,583
They all used to be back-up singers
before they became stars.

489
00:53:41,208 --> 00:53:44,166
All you need is one hit song.

490
00:53:47,291 --> 00:53:51,125
I have a few new songs
that I haven’t sold.

491
00:53:51,208 --> 00:53:52,458
They might fit your voice.

492
00:53:52,541 --> 00:53:55,083
If you want,
come over to Cuong’s next week to try out,

493
00:53:55,666 --> 00:53:57,541
we’re throwing a party.

494
00:53:58,916 --> 00:54:02,333
This is a huge opportunity, how could I?

495
00:54:03,166 --> 00:54:05,375
Opportunities only come to
those who truly deserve them.

496
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,750
You can ask Phuong to come with you.

497
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:15,416
Things will be much easier for you
if Phuong is there.

498
00:54:17,208 --> 00:54:18,291
Drink up.

499
00:54:26,583 --> 00:54:31,416
Cuong is throwing a party this weekend,
you should come with me.

500
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:34,041
You keep hanging out with those guys,

501
00:54:34,125 --> 00:54:35,708
they’ll chew you up
and spit you out one day.

502
00:54:37,291 --> 00:54:42,833
Cuong is a nice guy,
and I like Thien’s music.

503
00:54:42,916 --> 00:54:45,916
Nobody gives you things for free.

504
00:54:46,541 --> 00:54:49,041
You have your dad’s support,

505
00:54:49,125 --> 00:54:52,375
and Khanh to take care of everything.

506
00:54:52,458 --> 00:54:55,041
Things are much easier for you.

507
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:59,291
Me, I have nobody.

508
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:06,541
If you’re busy, I can go by myself.

509
00:55:09,291 --> 00:55:11,791
It's alright, I’ll come with you.

510
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:13,000
Really?

511
00:55:13,083 --> 00:55:15,500
But you have to do
what I say when we’re there.

512
00:55:27,166 --> 00:55:28,208
Ly?

513
00:55:30,416 --> 00:55:33,625
Sorry, I just wanted to drop off
a few contracts for you.

514
00:55:33,708 --> 00:55:36,000
-Just leave them there.
-Okay.

515
00:55:39,708 --> 00:55:41,166
I'm going now.

516
00:55:55,916 --> 00:55:57,125
Baby Na.

517
00:55:58,041 --> 00:56:02,750
Khanh looks normal on the outside

518
00:56:04,416 --> 00:56:09,583
but I think he’s actually sad
and lonely deep down inside.

519
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:32,291
Only I can help him.

520
00:56:36,625 --> 00:56:39,416
<i>You have to be there for him,</i>

521
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:44,541
<i>and one day he’ll love you.</i>

522
00:57:02,375 --> 00:57:03,291
You called me?

523
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:05,458
Come in, Ly.

524
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:18,833
Hey, I just wanted to apologize
for hugging you the other day.

525
00:57:18,916 --> 00:57:19,875
I think…

526
00:57:21,208 --> 00:57:22,375
What do you think?

527
00:57:23,833 --> 00:57:26,125
-Well… I'm embarrassed.
-What?

528
00:57:26,208 --> 00:57:29,166
I couldn’t help myself. I was scared.

529
00:57:29,833 --> 00:57:33,000
No, I'm talking about the song.

530
00:57:34,375 --> 00:57:35,458
How is it?

531
00:57:39,958 --> 00:57:40,958
Have a seat.

532
00:57:47,666 --> 00:57:49,250
It sounds familiar.

533
00:57:50,041 --> 00:57:51,458
Don't make me wait.

534
00:57:54,541 --> 00:57:55,500
Stay with me tonight.

535
00:57:56,333 --> 00:57:57,416
What?

536
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:00,333
What's a better title?

537
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,500
"Don’t make me wait" or "Stay with
me tonight," which title do you like?

538
00:58:07,375 --> 00:58:12,166
Oh… "Don't make me wait" sounds trendier.

539
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:14,583
Okay, the singer has spoken!

540
00:58:19,041 --> 00:58:20,666
-Ly!
-Yes?

541
00:58:21,541 --> 00:58:22,458
Will you sing this song?

542
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:27,333
But you wrote this one

543
00:58:27,416 --> 00:58:31,000
for Phuong.

544
00:58:32,333 --> 00:58:35,458
I've adjusted it to suit you better.

545
00:58:38,875 --> 00:58:39,708
Are you sure?

546
00:58:40,375 --> 00:58:46,375
I’m certain that only
Mai Ly can replace Lam Phuong.

547
01:00:54,375 --> 01:00:56,375
MAI LY DON’T PLAY WITH FIRE

548
01:01:12,791 --> 01:01:16,583
<i>Khanh has been so nice to me.</i>

549
01:01:17,166 --> 01:01:19,416
He’s texting me all the time,

550
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,083
and picking me up
and dropping me off everywhere.

551
01:01:25,541 --> 01:01:26,625
I love you the most.

552
01:02:26,208 --> 01:02:27,291
Huyen,

553
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,166
you can head home first.

554
01:02:31,041 --> 01:02:32,125
Why?

555
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:35,500
I’m going with Khanh for a nightcap.

556
01:02:37,791 --> 01:02:41,166
Be careful, don't get caught in scandals
before you’re even famous.

557
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:47,416
I know, but I love him.

558
01:02:48,583 --> 01:02:53,125
His fiancée passed away
like six months ago

559
01:02:53,208 --> 01:02:55,583
and he’s already all over you.

560
01:02:55,666 --> 01:02:57,625
You might just be a rebound,

561
01:02:57,708 --> 01:02:58,666
some temporary replacement,

562
01:03:00,541 --> 01:03:02,333
but it's certainly not real love.

563
01:03:03,625 --> 01:03:05,208
Shut up.

564
01:03:05,791 --> 01:03:07,125
You're just jealous.

565
01:03:08,125 --> 01:03:09,333
What did you say?

566
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:01,583
Khanh.

567
01:04:56,166 --> 01:04:58,416
Babe! What's wrong?

568
01:05:01,291 --> 01:05:02,291
I…

569
01:05:03,291 --> 01:05:04,375
I'm fine.

570
01:05:23,291 --> 01:05:24,625
Ly,

571
01:05:24,708 --> 01:05:27,291
did I do anything to upset you last night?

572
01:05:30,583 --> 01:05:32,750
It's just that I haven't been with anyone
in a while

573
01:05:33,416 --> 01:05:35,083
so I'm not completely comfortable.

574
01:05:37,375 --> 01:05:39,250
I won't force you into anything
if you're not ready.

575
01:05:41,291 --> 01:05:42,458
I'm going to protect you.

576
01:05:44,583 --> 01:05:45,916
But do you love me?

577
01:05:52,541 --> 01:05:54,041
I never thought

578
01:05:56,083 --> 01:05:57,541
I could feel this way again.

579
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:00,083
But to be honest,

580
01:06:01,416 --> 01:06:02,708
sometimes…

581
01:06:04,916 --> 01:06:08,416
I don't think I'm ready to love again.

582
01:06:13,666 --> 01:06:15,291
Phuong was my whole world.

583
01:06:16,625 --> 01:06:20,833
After the clip came out,
Phuong didn’t say anything to me.

584
01:06:22,333 --> 01:06:24,041
I felt betrayed.

585
01:06:24,125 --> 01:06:26,125
I felt like a fool.

586
01:06:27,708 --> 01:06:31,333
Maybe it was difficult
for Phuong to open up.

587
01:06:31,416 --> 01:06:34,041
You two were very close.

588
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,875
At the party,

589
01:06:38,041 --> 01:06:39,416
did she say anything to you?

590
01:06:39,916 --> 01:06:43,083
She just asked me to come with her,

591
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:45,041
I didn’t know anything else.

592
01:07:10,291 --> 01:07:11,833
Hi, Ly Coco.

593
01:07:13,958 --> 01:07:17,000
This is my friend Cuong.

594
01:07:17,083 --> 01:07:21,166
It’s such an honor to have you here.

595
01:07:22,083 --> 01:07:24,791
Ly is the guest tonight,
I’m just tagging along.

596
01:07:26,666 --> 01:07:29,291
Let me show you in.

597
01:07:50,875 --> 01:07:54,208
I heard you had an offer for Ly?

598
01:07:57,625 --> 01:08:00,083
Business talk already?

599
01:08:00,166 --> 01:08:02,000
Have a little fun.

600
01:08:13,125 --> 01:08:15,791
We’re recording a new album soon
so we can’t drink.

601
01:08:15,875 --> 01:08:17,916
Otherwise, we’d outdrink all of you!

602
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:24,791
I have a new song,

603
01:08:24,875 --> 01:08:29,416
which I think would be perfect
for a duet with you and Ly.

604
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:33,958
How’s your production schedule?

605
01:08:34,041 --> 01:08:36,250
Can I squeeze my song in?

606
01:08:37,375 --> 01:08:41,125
I have to check with Khanh first.
Do you have a demo?

607
01:08:44,541 --> 01:08:45,416
Of course!

608
01:09:03,291 --> 01:09:05,208
Wow, it’s cool.

609
01:09:05,291 --> 01:09:07,083
It's going to be a hit.

610
01:09:08,125 --> 01:09:11,041
So, you see how nice we are to Ly Coco?

611
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,208
I’m going to wait for Khanh to come back,

612
01:09:13,291 --> 01:09:15,416
and if he's okay,
we can all have a drink together.

613
01:09:20,125 --> 01:09:21,625
Then just one glass for now.

614
01:09:22,708 --> 01:09:24,041
Go on.

615
01:09:32,083 --> 01:09:33,333
Let’s drink.

616
01:09:35,291 --> 01:09:37,666
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

617
01:11:31,166 --> 01:11:33,458
I'm going to stop by the studio,
I’ll pick you up later.

618
01:11:34,458 --> 01:11:35,291
Okay.

619
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,416
-Yes?
<i>-Flower delivery.</i>

620
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,208
<i>Can you come to the lobby to sign for it?</i>

621
01:11:56,291 --> 01:11:57,708
I’ll be right down.

622
01:12:09,333 --> 01:12:13,291
{\an8}WITH DEEPEST SYMPATHY

623
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:19,666
Are you Nguyen Mai Ly?

624
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,583
Who’s the sender?

625
01:12:24,666 --> 01:12:25,833
I have no idea.

626
01:12:25,916 --> 01:12:28,250
I was just told to deliver it here
for you.

627
01:12:28,333 --> 01:12:33,625
This must be some mistake. I’m sorry.

628
01:12:33,708 --> 01:12:36,708
How can it be a mistake? It's your face!

629
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:00,791
WHY DID YOU CHANGE YOUR NUMBER?

630
01:13:00,875 --> 01:13:02,083
WANT TO PARTY WITH US AGAIN?

631
01:13:02,166 --> 01:13:03,500
OR DO YOU WANT TO END UP LIKE PHUONG?

632
01:13:08,583 --> 01:13:11,916
Cuong, I’m telling you one last time,
I’m not afraid of you.

633
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,833
I’m not that kind of girl.

634
01:13:13,916 --> 01:13:17,541
Don’t try to threaten me. It won't work!

635
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:20,833
Phuong, they just called me too.

636
01:13:20,916 --> 01:13:22,833
The hell with them!

637
01:13:22,916 --> 01:13:25,375
But they said this was the last warning.

638
01:13:25,458 --> 01:13:26,875
If we don’t come, they will…

639
01:13:26,958 --> 01:13:29,291
They've been threatening me
for two months now.

640
01:13:29,375 --> 01:13:31,541
These bastards
don't have the guts to do anything.

641
01:13:41,625 --> 01:13:43,083
There's an ancient proverb:

642
01:13:43,166 --> 01:13:44,666
"Inner beauty outweighs beauty
on the outside."

643
01:13:44,750 --> 01:13:48,000
But I don't see anything wrong
with looking beautiful.

644
01:13:48,083 --> 01:13:50,333
Tell you a secret… I've got both!

645
01:13:52,416 --> 01:13:56,750
My dear sisters,
true beauty comes from within.

646
01:13:56,833 --> 01:14:01,125
Your confidence, your take-charge attitude
are your best accessories.

647
01:14:01,208 --> 01:14:04,708
But don't forget this,
pretty girls always get the guys.

648
01:14:22,916 --> 01:14:24,708
This is Phuong, it’s her.

649
01:14:27,666 --> 01:14:28,833
What is it?

650
01:14:31,625 --> 01:14:34,333
-Sex clip?
-Oh, that’s bad.

651
01:14:34,416 --> 01:14:35,875
Is that true?

652
01:14:37,958 --> 01:14:39,083
Khanh.

653
01:14:57,625 --> 01:15:00,458
Phuong, can you explain all of this?

654
01:15:05,375 --> 01:15:07,291
Phuong.

655
01:15:13,125 --> 01:15:15,291
Phuong.

656
01:15:16,125 --> 01:15:17,250
Lam Phuong.

657
01:15:18,083 --> 01:15:19,625
A lot of people are
questioning your lifestyle!

658
01:15:19,708 --> 01:15:21,916
You go to these events often?
Who are those men?

659
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,083
I don’t know.

660
01:15:24,166 --> 01:15:26,375
I was drugged. I am a victim.

661
01:15:26,458 --> 01:15:27,458
Go!

662
01:15:27,541 --> 01:15:30,250
Lam Phuong.

663
01:15:34,708 --> 01:15:36,833
SEX CLIP OF SINGER LAM PHUONG

664
01:15:37,916 --> 01:15:42,041
ANGRY BACKLASH FOR LAM PHUONG

665
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,375
SHE'S HIGH LIKE A DRUG-ADDICT!

666
01:15:57,458 --> 01:15:59,166
HER SINGING IS BULLSHIT!

667
01:15:59,250 --> 01:16:00,958
WHAT ABUSE? SHE LOVED IT!

668
01:16:01,041 --> 01:16:02,958
SERVES HER RIGHT! WHAT AN INNOCENT COVER!

669
01:16:03,041 --> 01:16:04,958
HAPPY NOW? GO TO HELL!

670
01:16:05,041 --> 01:16:08,958
DIE!

671
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,083
<i>These people are dangerous.</i>

672
01:16:34,083 --> 01:16:37,458
I’m going to die if I don’t do something.

673
01:16:40,708 --> 01:16:42,583
What you need,

674
01:16:43,708 --> 01:16:44,958
Na can’t give to you.

675
01:16:46,458 --> 01:16:47,541
It’s very difficult.

676
01:16:53,166 --> 01:16:55,125
I’m going to die.

677
01:16:57,375 --> 01:16:58,583
Please, you have to help me.

678
01:17:03,416 --> 01:17:04,375
Fetus…

679
01:17:06,333 --> 01:17:07,208
Fetus?

680
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:10,916
You can't find this in Vietnam.

681
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,625
Have to bring it in from Thailand.

682
01:17:13,333 --> 01:17:17,125
And even over there it’s illegal.

683
01:17:28,416 --> 01:17:30,250
-Hello, sister.
-Hi.

684
01:17:32,291 --> 01:17:33,500
Welcome, master.

685
01:18:12,833 --> 01:18:15,625
Baby Na needs to be cleansed from within

686
01:18:15,708 --> 01:18:17,791
in order to receive a new soul,

687
01:18:17,875 --> 01:18:21,291
that of the sacred demon spawn.

688
01:18:26,958 --> 01:18:31,208
The dark liquid is made of gold dust
and dirt from Napran temple,

689
01:18:31,291 --> 01:18:33,416
allowing the new soul to enter.

690
01:18:44,833 --> 01:18:49,375
The demon infant is led
through the gateway of the soul,

691
01:18:49,458 --> 01:18:52,333
at this time baby Na
is in her weakest state.

692
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:57,125
The enchanted knife
makes sure that only the right person

693
01:18:57,208 --> 01:18:59,416
can lead other spirits
through the gateway of the soul.

694
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:25,750
Roc-sam-long…
this is the tamed demon infant,

695
01:19:25,833 --> 01:19:29,166
called upon by the shaman.

696
01:19:43,708 --> 01:19:45,541
<i>Sam-sat-yam ritual</i>

697
01:19:45,625 --> 01:19:49,291
<i>is to connect you</i>
<i>to both Na and Roc-sam-long,</i>

698
01:19:49,375 --> 01:19:52,916
<i>to insure these infant souls</i>
<i>will do as you command.</i>

699
01:21:32,875 --> 01:21:34,125
Baby Na,

700
01:21:36,791 --> 01:21:38,708
if you love Mommy…

701
01:21:40,250 --> 01:21:42,458
please protect me from these bad people,

702
01:21:44,708 --> 01:21:46,541
please don't let them hurt me.

703
01:22:14,875 --> 01:22:16,666
You have to save me.

704
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,416
I'm so scared.

705
01:22:22,625 --> 01:22:24,666
They threatened my life!

706
01:22:27,458 --> 01:22:30,041
It's all because I was hungry for fame,

707
01:22:30,875 --> 01:22:32,291
and I was a coward.

708
01:22:34,666 --> 01:22:39,250
Now I'm just a puppet
in the hands of these bastards!

709
01:22:43,958 --> 01:22:46,416
Can you save me, baby Na?

710
01:23:48,583 --> 01:23:51,750
Nguyen Vinh Cuong,
son of a real estate tycoon.

711
01:23:51,833 --> 01:23:53,166
He has a history of drug abuse.

712
01:23:57,208 --> 01:23:58,666
A staged death.

713
01:23:59,833 --> 01:24:04,458
Some sort of gang war?

714
01:24:05,250 --> 01:24:08,916
No, this looks more like personal revenge.

715
01:24:26,708 --> 01:24:29,791
I have bad news for our superstar!

716
01:24:32,375 --> 01:24:35,166
Why does your place feel so morbid?

717
01:24:35,250 --> 01:24:37,083
So? What's the bad news?

718
01:24:37,791 --> 01:24:41,708
You just got suspended from school
for skipping class too much.

719
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:43,708
That’s not bad news.

720
01:24:46,708 --> 01:24:47,666
You rushed me for this?

721
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:49,458
My hair is still wet.

722
01:24:49,541 --> 01:24:51,625
Come wait upstairs.

723
01:25:30,416 --> 01:25:31,583
What are you doing?

724
01:25:34,291 --> 01:25:35,416
Why do you have a dead man's photo?

725
01:25:36,791 --> 01:25:37,958
What do you mean?

726
01:25:39,416 --> 01:25:42,125
Didn’t you read the news?
How do you know him?

727
01:25:51,333 --> 01:25:52,333
Why?

728
01:25:53,541 --> 01:25:54,625
Why did he die?

729
01:25:55,333 --> 01:25:56,750
Who is he?

730
01:26:17,125 --> 01:26:18,083
The party.

731
01:26:19,958 --> 01:26:23,375
He’s the one who invited me and Phuong.

732
01:26:25,958 --> 01:26:27,666
He drugged us.

733
01:26:29,833 --> 01:26:32,916
He raped us and recorded the whole thing!

734
01:26:34,041 --> 01:26:37,250
They wanted Phuong to become their slave.

735
01:26:40,166 --> 01:26:45,250
He released the video
when Phuong refused to do what he wanted.

736
01:26:46,875 --> 01:26:48,583
And now it’s my turn.

737
01:26:50,208 --> 01:26:52,125
Why didn’t you tell me?

738
01:27:02,208 --> 01:27:04,875
So all those months,

739
01:27:04,958 --> 01:27:07,958
you lied about being depressed
from a break up.

740
01:27:08,041 --> 01:27:10,125
I was a nobody back then,

741
01:27:11,833 --> 01:27:14,000
so they didn’t bother me.

742
01:27:16,208 --> 01:27:17,541
But it’s different now.

743
01:27:19,916 --> 01:27:21,208
I’m scared.

744
01:27:22,625 --> 01:27:24,875
I don’t want to lose everything,

745
01:27:25,750 --> 01:27:27,083
like Phuong.

746
01:27:28,875 --> 01:27:30,791
And his death had nothing
to do with you, right?

747
01:27:30,875 --> 01:27:33,208
No, I was just asking for protection,

748
01:27:34,041 --> 01:27:35,625
I didn’t mean anything!

749
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:39,291
Baby Na killed him to protect me.

750
01:27:40,833 --> 01:27:44,208
You’re out of your mind.

751
01:27:47,833 --> 01:27:49,208
You have to get rid of this thing!

752
01:27:50,250 --> 01:27:51,541
Don't touch my baby!

753
01:27:59,833 --> 01:28:01,791
She’s just protecting me.

754
01:28:06,083 --> 01:28:07,375
This is voodoo!

755
01:28:07,875 --> 01:28:09,166
It's evil! You get that, right?

756
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:14,125
This doll is messing up your head,
you have to tear down this room!

757
01:28:15,083 --> 01:28:18,000
Or there’ll be consequences.

758
01:28:21,875 --> 01:28:22,833
Leave me alone.

759
01:28:25,833 --> 01:28:26,833
Go away.

760
01:28:28,125 --> 01:28:31,250
Ly, someone just died. This is no joke!

761
01:28:31,833 --> 01:28:35,166
Are you done? Just get out!

762
01:28:47,125 --> 01:28:48,791
SON OF RICH LAND DEALER FOUND DEAD

763
01:28:48,875 --> 01:28:51,166
I thought I would get exactly
what I asked for.

764
01:28:52,166 --> 01:28:55,500
I asked Kumanthong for protection,
not murder.

765
01:28:57,083 --> 01:29:01,416
But now he’s dead,
he can’t hurt you anymore.

766
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:02,833
Isn’t that what you wanted?

767
01:29:04,791 --> 01:29:05,791
I want to return baby Na.

768
01:29:10,333 --> 01:29:13,875
You young people are so ungrateful.

769
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,208
You're selfish and superficial.

770
01:29:25,291 --> 01:29:27,875
You think anything can be bought,

771
01:29:27,958 --> 01:29:30,250
used up and returned
whenever you feel like it.

772
01:29:32,875 --> 01:29:36,291
Ly, you’re dealing with a spirit here.

773
01:29:37,291 --> 01:29:42,625
Your guardian angel is a baby,
it lost its chance to be born.

774
01:29:42,708 --> 01:29:44,416
You accepted her into your life,

775
01:29:44,916 --> 01:29:46,625
she did your bidding

776
01:29:47,833 --> 01:29:51,208
and now you want to abandon her?

777
01:29:58,166 --> 01:29:59,375
I’m telling you,

778
01:30:00,250 --> 01:30:04,791
an angry spirit can do a lot of damage.

779
01:30:19,208 --> 01:30:21,500
<i>This doll is messing up your head,</i>

780
01:30:22,541 --> 01:30:24,583
<i>you have to tear down this room!</i>

781
01:30:25,208 --> 01:30:28,250
<i>Or there’ll be consequences.</i>

782
01:30:53,625 --> 01:30:57,583
-These three seem pretty close.
-Hold on. There's more.

783
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:12,000
This is what we got from Cuong’s laptop,
there must be hundreds.

784
01:31:14,583 --> 01:31:15,625
Get me information on the other two.

785
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:29,375
What are you doing, Ms. Nam?

786
01:31:32,791 --> 01:31:33,875
What’s wrong?

787
01:31:36,583 --> 01:31:38,250
I came this afternoon…

788
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:42,875
When I was cleaning, I heard something.

789
01:31:46,291 --> 01:31:48,375
Heard what?

790
01:31:52,375 --> 01:31:54,625
It’s hard to describe. But…

791
01:31:56,291 --> 01:31:59,875
<i>Like something scratching on the wall.</i>

792
01:31:59,958 --> 01:32:00,916
<i>And…</i>

793
01:32:02,833 --> 01:32:06,333
<i>It came from the altar room.</i>

794
01:32:08,583 --> 01:32:10,500
<i>I thought maybe you got a cat,</i>

795
01:32:11,333 --> 01:32:13,875
<i>but the scratching</i>
<i>got more and more frantic.</i>

796
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:28,916
What did you see?

797
01:32:34,166 --> 01:32:35,916
You should see for yourself.

798
01:36:57,041 --> 01:37:00,333
YOU THINK YOU CAN GET RID OF US?

799
01:37:01,083 --> 01:37:05,416
THIS PHOTO IS TOO BLURRY,
WE’VE GOT BETTER ONES.

800
01:37:07,708 --> 01:37:14,333
Mommy’s so sorry,
I’m never going to leave you again.

801
01:37:23,458 --> 01:37:26,375
Can you please help me one more time?

802
01:37:29,291 --> 01:37:34,625
Take a close look,
these people want to hurt me.

803
01:37:36,541 --> 01:37:38,041
I beg you…

804
01:37:41,541 --> 01:37:43,250
punish them for me!

805
01:37:49,666 --> 01:37:52,875
I THINK MS. TAM AND HER GROUP
ARE UP TO NO GOOD.

806
01:37:52,958 --> 01:37:54,250
YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL.

807
01:38:09,333 --> 01:38:12,166
Can I go up to the penthouse?

808
01:38:12,250 --> 01:38:13,416
Are you interested in renting it?

809
01:38:15,250 --> 01:38:16,250
Sure.

810
01:39:12,083 --> 01:39:15,833
SHADY KUMANTHONG GROUP BUSTED!

811
01:40:58,083 --> 01:41:01,541
Why did Baby Na hurt Huyen?

812
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:06,083
Huyen only meant well when she warned me.

813
01:41:08,541 --> 01:41:10,500
She’s my best friend.

814
01:41:10,583 --> 01:41:11,958
Warned?

815
01:41:12,875 --> 01:41:14,375
Warned you about what?

816
01:41:15,750 --> 01:41:18,208
She said something
about a shady Kumanthong group

817
01:41:18,958 --> 01:41:20,250
and police were onto their scams.

818
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,250
Is that so?

819
01:41:24,083 --> 01:41:25,125
Sis.

820
01:41:25,750 --> 01:41:31,500
What if… you and I…
we’re being played here?

821
01:41:34,833 --> 01:41:36,541
Huyen was just imagining stuff!

822
01:41:50,791 --> 01:41:53,750
Look here! It's your penthouse!

823
01:41:54,958 --> 01:41:58,416
Why did you trick me
into joining that group?

824
01:41:58,500 --> 01:41:59,666
What are you up to?

825
01:42:03,250 --> 01:42:06,583
What’s wrong with you? Are you possessed?

826
01:42:06,666 --> 01:42:08,291
There’s no trick here.

827
01:42:09,166 --> 01:42:10,541
You’re lying!

828
01:42:10,625 --> 01:42:12,833
What about the penthouse?

829
01:42:20,250 --> 01:42:23,291
You're so paranoid. I moved, that’s all.

830
01:42:24,416 --> 01:42:29,083
I needed a bigger place
because we have more members now.

831
01:42:29,166 --> 01:42:32,833
A few joined after you left,

832
01:42:32,916 --> 01:42:36,416
you’re not the only one
in need of a guardian angel.

833
01:42:41,833 --> 01:42:43,125
What the hell are you laughing at?

834
01:42:44,708 --> 01:42:45,958
You think it's funny?

835
01:42:47,250 --> 01:42:50,625
You wanted to silence Huyen, didn't you?
You think I’m scared of you?

836
01:42:51,791 --> 01:42:53,750
I’m going to call the police on you.

837
01:42:53,833 --> 01:42:57,416
I'm going to reveal all
of your deranged schemes.

838
01:43:01,083 --> 01:43:03,000
I only see a deranged girl sitting here.

839
01:43:07,041 --> 01:43:09,791
You can’t deny the power of Kumanthong.

840
01:43:10,416 --> 01:43:12,208
Baby Na gave you everything.

841
01:43:13,416 --> 01:43:16,291
Fame, love, revenge.

842
01:43:16,375 --> 01:43:19,125
The three who hurt you are now dead.

843
01:43:19,208 --> 01:43:20,458
You got Khanh.

844
01:43:20,541 --> 01:43:23,291
What else do you want?

845
01:43:32,416 --> 01:43:33,833
Khanh?

846
01:43:45,125 --> 01:43:48,208
I never told you his name was Khanh.

847
01:44:17,458 --> 01:44:22,083
Thank you for bringing me
all these opportunities.

848
01:44:22,166 --> 01:44:25,625
I know you listen to all my prayers.

849
01:44:26,500 --> 01:44:29,583
Only I can help Khanh.

850
01:44:30,958 --> 01:44:34,791
Na, if you love me… punish them for me!

851
01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:49,958
<i>The three who hurt you are now dead.</i>

852
01:44:50,041 --> 01:44:53,083
You got Khanh. What else do you want?

853
01:44:55,916 --> 01:44:58,458
I never told you his name was Khanh.

854
01:45:45,166 --> 01:45:47,541
Khanh, they recorded me!

855
01:45:47,625 --> 01:45:49,541
They heard it all, they know everything!

856
01:45:58,291 --> 01:46:02,125
You see. Huyen was right.
It was all a scam.

857
01:46:06,625 --> 01:46:09,500
It’s all right. Calm down.

858
01:46:20,625 --> 01:46:23,125
I can’t breathe.

859
01:46:24,375 --> 01:46:25,541
What are you doing?

860
01:46:27,958 --> 01:46:30,375
It's over, Ly.

861
01:46:36,541 --> 01:46:39,000
What are you saying?

862
01:46:40,208 --> 01:46:45,458
If you had just told the police
everything you told Baby Na…

863
01:46:46,541 --> 01:46:47,500
it wouldn’t have turned out like this.

864
01:46:48,583 --> 01:46:49,500
What?

865
01:46:52,041 --> 01:46:53,625
Phuong loved you like a sister.

866
01:46:54,916 --> 01:46:55,958
But…

867
01:46:58,416 --> 01:47:03,416
Even after Phuong was shamed in public
and died a tragic death

868
01:47:04,791 --> 01:47:08,125
you still would not reveal
the identities of those men.

869
01:47:09,458 --> 01:47:12,541
You were afraid of losing your shot
at fame and fortune.

870
01:47:16,958 --> 01:47:22,625
This was the only way…
and I knew my plan would work.

871
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Plan?

872
01:47:26,666 --> 01:47:28,666
You helped me get revenge for Phuong.

873
01:47:32,333 --> 01:47:34,291
{\an8}WITH DEEPEST SYMPATHY

874
01:47:36,125 --> 01:47:37,791
{\an8}OR DO YOU WANT TO END UP LIKE PHUONG?

875
01:48:22,458 --> 01:48:24,625
Phuong was everything to me.

876
01:48:28,875 --> 01:48:30,541
We were going to get married.

877
01:48:32,625 --> 01:48:37,083
You know…
I loved Phuong more than anything.

878
01:48:40,041 --> 01:48:41,458
When she died…

879
01:48:45,375 --> 01:48:47,333
I had nothing left to live for.

880
01:48:49,541 --> 01:48:50,458
I swore

881
01:48:51,916 --> 01:48:54,750
I would avenge her at any cost.

882
01:48:58,666 --> 01:49:01,333
<i>I would stop at nothing.</i>

883
01:49:09,125 --> 01:49:10,541
So it was…

884
01:49:13,041 --> 01:49:14,833
all part of a plan?

885
01:49:19,791 --> 01:49:21,625
I thought…

886
01:49:22,541 --> 01:49:23,791
What did you think?

887
01:49:26,375 --> 01:49:28,291
That you deserved all that?

888
01:49:32,041 --> 01:49:33,583
Everything you have now,

889
01:49:35,375 --> 01:49:36,875
belonged to Phuong.

890
01:49:38,250 --> 01:49:40,250
Even your doll.

891
01:49:44,291 --> 01:49:45,500
<i>Na…</i>

892
01:49:47,416 --> 01:49:48,666
<i>was Yuki.</i>

893
01:50:08,083 --> 01:50:09,375
And according to my plan,

894
01:50:11,541 --> 01:50:12,791
you have to die.

895
01:50:18,833 --> 01:50:20,375
To bury the evidence.

896
01:50:20,458 --> 01:50:22,833
All the blame would point towards you.

897
01:50:24,416 --> 01:50:27,416
I planned everything that way.

898
01:50:28,875 --> 01:50:30,041
Khanh.

899
01:50:40,791 --> 01:50:41,833
Khanh.

900
01:50:43,958 --> 01:50:48,291
You can do whatever
you want to me but please,

901
01:50:51,500 --> 01:50:54,875
can you let me do one last thing?

902
01:50:56,958 --> 01:50:58,750
One last thing that I need to do.

903
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:02,458
I beg you.

904
01:51:32,875 --> 01:51:34,208
This is the truth

905
01:51:35,541 --> 01:51:37,416
that I want everyone to know.

906
01:51:54,916 --> 01:51:57,291
HUYEN, LY IS CONFESSING.

907
01:51:57,375 --> 01:52:01,500
SO SHE'S BEEN LYING TO US ALL ALONG.

908
01:52:06,416 --> 01:52:11,416
<i>Phuong warned me</i>
<i>about those people but I didn’t listen.</i>

909
01:52:14,125 --> 01:52:17,375
<i>There were three men</i>
<i>in masks who hurt Phuong.</i>

910
01:52:18,625 --> 01:52:19,708
<i>And I…</i>

911
01:52:20,333 --> 01:52:21,875
{\an8}WHAT A SHAME I CAN'T HELP YOU

912
01:52:21,958 --> 01:52:23,208
{\an8}WHAT'S THIS NONSENSE. TIRED!

913
01:52:23,291 --> 01:52:30,250
I wore a mask every day to protect myself.

914
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:35,375
Uncle Hai, Ly has a new clip.

915
01:52:36,916 --> 01:52:38,791
<i>If it wasn’t for me,</i>

916
01:52:40,125 --> 01:52:42,416
<i>you would still be alive.</i>

917
01:52:43,125 --> 01:52:46,125
<i>You would still be a star,</i>
<i>admired by millions of people.</i>

918
01:52:47,166 --> 01:52:52,333
<i>If it wasn't for me,</i>
<i>your father would still have a daughter.</i>

919
01:52:53,375 --> 01:52:55,166
I’m so sorry,

920
01:52:56,500 --> 01:52:57,541
Phuong.

921
01:53:01,375 --> 01:53:02,541
<i>Huyen,</i>

922
01:53:03,958 --> 01:53:08,833
<i>now I know there’s</i>
<i>no such thing as a guardian angel.</i>

923
01:53:10,833 --> 01:53:14,541
<i>But I know</i>
<i>I have one true friend, that’s you.</i>

924
01:53:15,666 --> 01:53:17,208
<i>You were always by my side,</i>

925
01:53:17,916 --> 01:53:19,416
protecting me.

926
01:53:28,791 --> 01:53:29,958
Dad,

927
01:53:31,291 --> 01:53:33,125
<i>please don’t be disappointed in me.</i>

928
01:53:34,208 --> 01:53:38,458
<i>I still remember all you have taught me…</i>
<i>but I couldn't help it.</i>

929
01:53:38,541 --> 01:53:40,666
<i>I got to live the life</i>
<i>I always dreamed of,</i>

930
01:53:40,750 --> 01:53:43,916
<i>but perhaps I didn't deserve it.</i>

931
01:53:46,166 --> 01:53:47,375
<i>If there’s a next life,</i>

932
01:53:48,166 --> 01:53:50,125
<i>I still want to be a singer.</i>

933
01:53:51,916 --> 01:53:54,583
<i>But not like this.</i>

934
01:54:27,375 --> 01:54:32,166
Even if you clear Phuong's name…
it's too late.

935
01:54:33,583 --> 01:54:36,375
I want you to live,
to truly pay for what you did.

936
01:54:58,500 --> 01:55:03,458
HUYEN

937
01:56:02,916 --> 01:56:04,541
I’m sorry.

938
01:58:09,125 --> 01:58:13,166
We found blood from a third person
at the last crime scene.

939
01:58:13,250 --> 01:58:18,416
It didn’t belong to the two victims,
nor the prime suspect, Ly.

940
01:58:19,083 --> 01:58:22,416
So… whose blood is it?

941
01:58:25,125 --> 01:58:26,333
The one seeking vengeance.

942
01:58:39,875 --> 01:58:41,625
A blood test will tell us everything.

943
01:58:42,916 --> 01:58:43,875
NGOC THIEN

944
01:58:46,166 --> 01:58:49,333
VINH CUONG

945
01:58:49,416 --> 01:58:52,375
FIANCÉ

946
01:58:52,458 --> 01:58:55,083
{\an8}FATHER MR. TRAN NGOC

947
01:58:57,333 --> 01:58:58,958
{\an8}UNCLE

948
01:58:59,041 --> 01:59:03,125
MRS. DO THANH TAM

949
01:59:06,416 --> 01:59:07,666
I'm sorry.

950
01:59:11,625 --> 01:59:13,500
I still can’t believe it.

951
01:59:14,333 --> 01:59:15,916
After all these years,

952
01:59:17,083 --> 01:59:19,916
I came back for my daughter’s wedding.

953
01:59:22,583 --> 01:59:23,875
But in the end…

954
01:59:26,833 --> 01:59:29,000
I couldn’t protect our daughter.

955
01:59:50,833 --> 01:59:52,291
I'm sorry.

956
02:00:07,916 --> 02:00:09,750
SING FOR YOU COMPETITION

957
02:00:45,208 --> 02:00:47,208
May you rest in peace.

958
02:01:06,125 --> 02:01:07,708
May you rest in peace.

959
02:02:15,541 --> 02:02:18,625
POLICE

960
02:03:15,666 --> 02:03:18,125
Wow, you’re getting so popular,

961
02:03:18,208 --> 02:03:20,291
you’re going to get advertising deals!

962
02:03:21,291 --> 02:03:24,291
You should be a full-time influencer.

963
02:03:24,375 --> 02:03:26,625
-Why bother with school?
-Stop it.

964
02:03:26,708 --> 02:03:30,125
I need to focus on school,
I have two months till graduation.

965
02:03:31,750 --> 02:03:33,375
Let me check it out.

966
02:03:39,125 --> 02:03:41,250
HELLO @HUYENNERTAKEITALL, I’M NGHIEM
FROM STARLIGHT, THE MODEL AGENCY.

967
02:03:41,333 --> 02:03:42,500
I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOUR VIDEOS
AND I LOVE THEM.

968
02:03:42,583 --> 02:03:43,791
CAN WE MEET UP AND HAVE A CHAT?

969
02:03:43,875 --> 02:03:47,250
I THINK I HAVE SOME OPPORTUNITIES
THAT ARE JUST RIGHT FOR YOU.

970
02:04:12,833 --> 02:04:14,791
THANK YOU.

971
02:04:14,875 --> 02:04:20,416
BUT I NEED TO FOCUS
ON MY EDUCATION AT THIS TIME.
