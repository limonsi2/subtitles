[girl] How do you do, Auntie Eleanor?

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,041
Well, hello, Mabel. What a lovely house.

7
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:58,125
Shall we go read together in the garden?

8
00:00:58,208 --> 00:00:59,208
[woman] Mabel!

00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,208

Any minute now, Mabel.

16
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:45,208
Are they nice people?

17
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:49,083
No, they're not.

Her name's Isobel.

30
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:31,875
Well, I can't see a thing.

31
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:35,291
Wait your turn, Georgie.
We're packed in here like cattle.

[Mabel] I'll be nine in June.

35
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:44,583
Hmm, you look very small for your age.

36
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,791
Would you like to hold her?

37
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:49,625
No.

38
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:50,833
I'm cold.

39
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,208
Care for a sandwich?

40
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,125

[man] Uh, no.

44
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:06,000
Did you make those curtains behind you?

45
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:08,416
Yes. Yes, I did.

46
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,166
She made my quilt too. And Isobel's shawl.

47
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,625
Poor children. [chuckling]

48
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:18,375
[snorts]
Why, isn't that the Mayhew commode?

49
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:20,708
[woman] So it is.

50
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:24,166
Well, from the lofty splendor
of the winter salon

51
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,333
to this gloomy corner of the world.

52
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,208
How we've fallen.

53
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,875
It belonged to my father.

54
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:33,791
Ha! Your father, worthless drunk!

55
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:36,625
Always whimpering. Whimpering about money.

56
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:40,041
Whimpering about debts.
He was a whimperer.

57
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,708
Gambled away everything.

58
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,583
Oh, not the Mayhew commode!

59
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:48,708
And you, Raymond,
with your education and opportunities.

60
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:49,625
It shocks me

61
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:53,333
that you still haven't managed
to lift yourself out of this squalor.

62
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:58,083
I see your father in you, Raymond.
It's a weakness.

They're very strange people,
aren't they, Mama?

67
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:27,750
They have their ways, but they are family.

Is he sad, Mama?

72
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:43,375
He should be fine in the morning.
He just needs some fresh air.

[owl hooting]

74

What is? What are you saying, Raymond?

98
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,666
What happened?

99
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,708
Everything's changed. [chuckling]

100
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,916
Everything. [grunting, chomping]

101
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,666
Fantastic. Mmm.

102
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,541
Wine. Penny, wine!

103
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:37,583
Wine?

104
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,041

I wish you would just tell me--

Shouldn't we wake Papa?

112
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,416
[Penny] No, Mabel. Let him sleep it off.

113
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,583
[knocking on door]

114
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:24,458
Ah!

115
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,583
Good day, madam. My name is Thomas.

116
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:33,541
I'm here on behalf
of my employer, Mr. Van Schoonbeek.

117
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:36,041
I'm here to discuss
the terms of the agreement.

118
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,166
Agreement?

119
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,583
[Thomas] Um, your husband spoke
with my employer last night, madam.

120
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,083
There was an agreement.

121
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,708
An agreement with who?

122
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,875
Mr. Van Schoonbeek.
He's an architect of great renown.

123
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:54,833
He's graciously offered his services
to build a house for you and your family.

124
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:59,000
Sorry, we're not in a financial position
for anything like that.

125
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:02,458
[inhales]
My husband must have gotten carried away.

126
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:06,625
You misunderstand, madam. It is a gift.

127
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:13,041
My employer has acquired the land
surrounding your cottage.

128
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:16,166
It is here that the house will be built.

129
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:20,625
You will come into possession of the land
as well as the estate upon its completion.

130
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,125
There is one condition.

131
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:28,708
The family must relinquish these premises
and take up residence in the house.

132
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:35,208
And that is all?
He doesn't want anything in return?

133
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,458
Money is no object to my employer, madam.

134
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,000
He is a great artist.

135
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:43,208
He desires nothing more
than creative satisfaction.

136
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,541
This Van Schoonbeek
was a friend of my father's.

137
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:50,166
He said we would be
the envy for miles around.

138
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,875
A beacon of light on the hill, Penny.

[floorboards creaking]

141
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,416
Regrettably, Mr. Van Schoonbeek
is a rather impatient man.

142
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,750
As such, we'll need
your permission in writing today.

143
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,416
Yes, I'll…

144
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,250
[suspenseful music playing]

145
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
[Thomas] Well, that's excellent.

146
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,875
So, when do you expect the work to begin?

147
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:32,416
Oh, I expect they've already started, sir.

148
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,166
Mr. Van Schoonbeek
doesn't like to dillydally.

149
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,833
[construction clanking]

150

[Raymond] Well,

155
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,416
here we are.

156
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,416
Come on.

157
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,583
[Penny] Unbelievable.

158
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:14,625
[Raymond] Magnificent.

159
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,625
-[gasps] Oh!
-[bushes rustling]

[Thomas clears throat]

161
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,666
Ah! Good morning, Mr. Thomas.

162
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,000
You've brought some of your possessions.

163
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:37,541
[Raymond] Yes, just a few things.

164
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,333
The house is fully furnished, sir.

165
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:42,875
Mr. Van Schoonbeek
specifically designed every piece himself.

166
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:47,791
Oh, but I have pieces here that have been
in my family for generations.

167
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,000
[inhales] Of course.
I understand completely.

168
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,458
I'll have the men
store them somewhere secure.

169

-[door unlocking]
-[keys jangling]

170
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:02,500
[Thomas] Through here, please.
If you'd care to follow me.

171
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,833
[Raymond gasps] Look at those ceilings.

172
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,083
That's an interesting color.

173
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:23,250
This corridor leads to the sitting room,
library, various closets,

174
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,208
the billiard room, guest rooms.

175
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:27,916
[exhales]

176
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,375
[Thomas] The west wing staircase.

177
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,583
And here we have the withdrawing room.

178
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:39,500
You can settle down here for the day
if it pleases you.

179
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,625
Oh my. Look at that fireplace.

180
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,208
Look at this sofa!

181
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,666
[Penny] No curtains?

[Raymond] Isn't it amazing?

184
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,416
Such fine material.

185
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,791
In the room opposite,
you'll find the dining room.

186
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:08,125
A selection of dishes
will be provided on a daily basis.

187
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:14,583
I shall take my leave now.
Good day, sir, madams.

Mmm, isn't it?

192
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,416
I'll never have to cook again.

193
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,583
[Raymond] Cooking?
It's a bloody waste of time.

[munching, slurping]

195
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,541
Who makes all this food?

196

Our servants, I suppose.

197
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,833

Hmm?

205
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,583
That's nice, Mabel.

206
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:07,416
Come on, Isobel.

207

[Thomas] Mr. Van Schoon…

232

It's… it is someone… someone… someone…

233

-Mr. Thomas!
-[frightened gasp]

235

[clears throat] Good morning, madam.

237
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:48,333
Uh, Mr. Van Schoonbeek
is making some minor adjustments.

238
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:52,500
You'll find a provisional passage
in the billiard room.

239
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,083
Thank you, Mr. Thomas.

I… [sighs]

[whining]

253
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:46,250
There was a man outside my window.
We can't see outside anymore.

254
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:48,875
Um, Mabel, I've got so much work to do.

255
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,833
Go find your father.
I'll see what there is for breakfast.

256
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:52,916
But, Mama!

281
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:25,333
[Thomas] Good evening.
Mr. Van Schoonbeek has a request to make.

282
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,791
[Raymond] Oh! What's that?

283
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:32,083
[Thomas] He would very much like
for you to accept these as a gift.

284
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:34,625
[Raymond] Oh my!

285
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,000
[Thomas] Please, take your time.

286
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,958
I'll wait here.

[Thomas] Ah yes. Very good.

290
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,833
It's not too bold, do you think?

291
00:18:56,541 --> 00:19:01,166
Oh, no, sir. No, no, no. Not at all.
Why don't you see for yourself?

292
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,666
They're wonderful.

293
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,208
Yes, and so modern.

294
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:13,916
I'm glad you like them.

295
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Mr. Van Schoonbeek
has specifically created these garments

296
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:20,000
to complement his architectural vision.

297
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,083
You look foolish.

Mabel!

00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,250
Why on earth would you say such a thing?

301
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:31,166
I'd like you to apologize.

302
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,125
Now, Mabel!

00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,000
I'm sorry.

there's plenty more in the basement.

371
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,750
Yes.

[male] Derek, can you hear me?

433
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,708
Yes. Hmm.

434
00:31:48,583 --> 00:31:49,416
Listen, Derek.

435
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,166
Because of the erratic nature
of redevelopment and budgetary pressures,

436
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:55,416
I've had to let the construction guys go.

437
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,375
So, just deliver the kitchen ASAP.

438
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:01,875
Let me install it myself, all right?

439
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:05,958
But let me say this.
I will be expecting some reimbursement.

440
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:08,166
If not on this job,
then on my next refurb.

441
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,583
I mean, it's the least that you can do.

It would be a shame
to ruin this relationship.

447
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:25,833
Now let's leave it at that,
shall we, Derek? [grunts]

448
00:32:27,541 --> 00:32:28,583
Excellent.

449
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,250
Fine. Sure. Yeah.

450
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:34,291

I'll talk to you soon, Derek.

No.

456
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:03,416
I would like to talk to Erica Stephens
in Business Loans.

457
00:33:04,541 --> 00:33:07,208
Erica Stephens.

00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:09,125
Business…

459
00:33:09,208 --> 00:33:13,041
Well, I have
20 to 25 very eager cash buyers.

460
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:16,791
And while I'd always say
that there are no certainties in life,

461
00:33:16,875 --> 00:33:20,083
in this case, Erica,
I'm pretty bloody certain

462
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:23,958
I'll be calling you with good news
directly after the viewing.

Hi, Sarah, good morning to you.

468

[Sarah] Good morning.

469
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:39,166

"It's not a good morning, Vanessa."

470

"It's a horrible morning."

471
00:33:40,333 --> 00:33:43,916
You just announced there's a recession
on top of everything else.

472
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,750
How significant is it

473
00:33:45,833 --> 00:33:48,291
when it's officially designated
a recession?

474
00:33:48,375 --> 00:33:52,000
What does it mean essentially?
What do they have to base such a thing on?

475
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:53,333
[groans, inhales]

476
00:33:53,416 --> 00:33:56,416
[Sarah] So, um, a technical recession,
which is what this is,

477
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:00,708
-is based on two quarters of falls in GDP.
-[beetles chittering]

478
00:34:00,791 --> 00:34:06,416
So this… this record falling GDP
of 20%… uh, just over 20%,

479
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,208
which is the largest quarterly contraction
in the UK economy

00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:10,458
The larvae of the fur beetle
do the biggest--

545
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,833
[sniffs, exhales]

546
00:38:17,541 --> 00:38:18,375
[grunts]

547
00:38:19,541 --> 00:38:20,750
[groans]

548
00:38:20,833 --> 00:38:21,666
[exhales]

549
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:26,083
[exhales]

550
00:38:26,166 --> 00:38:27,083
Right!

551
00:38:30,416 --> 00:38:31,958
-[grunts]
-[beetles chittering]

552
00:38:32,041 --> 00:38:35,416
-[contractor] Yeah. Come on then! Come on!
-[machine whirring]

553
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,333
Yeah. Yeah. You like it?

554
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:40,125
You like it, do you?
You like it. Come on then.

555
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:41,208
[beetles chittering]

556
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:44,708
[contractor] You're going down.
You're going down. You're going down!

557
00:38:44,791 --> 00:38:47,458
[grunts] You're going down. Yeah?

558
00:38:47,541 --> 00:38:48,416
[banging]

559
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,041
Take it! Take it!

560
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:52,125
Ooh, ooh! [straining]

561
00:38:52,208 --> 00:38:53,375
[banging intensifies]

562
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:54,958
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

563
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:55,875
[grunts]

564
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:00,416
Shit!

565
00:39:01,333 --> 00:39:02,791
[banging continues]

566
00:39:02,875 --> 00:39:04,250
Oof! Ooh!

567
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:05,958
You bast-- You fu--

568
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:09,833
[snoring]

569
00:39:16,666 --> 00:39:20,416
-[bell tower ringing in distance]
-[snorting]

570
00:39:21,833 --> 00:39:23,166
[sighs]

571
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,375
[melancholy music playing]

572
00:39:42,958 --> 00:39:47,041
[beetles scuttling, chittering]

573
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:54,000
[contractor] Hi, darling. It's me.

574
00:39:54,541 --> 00:39:57,083
It's the biggest day of my life today.

575
00:39:58,041 --> 00:40:01,666
If you could be thinking of me,
you know, maybe say a little prayer,

576
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:03,250
I'd really appreciate it.

577
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:04,916
Uh…

578
00:40:06,416 --> 00:40:07,250
Hello?

579
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:13,708
[liquid splashing]

580
00:40:25,208 --> 00:40:26,166
[grunts]

581
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:29,208
Come on.

582
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:36,083
Whoa!

583
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:37,625
-Come on!
-[doorbell buzzing]

584
00:40:42,208 --> 00:40:44,333
[van engine roaring]

585
00:40:47,666 --> 00:40:49,666
[humming]

586
00:40:54,416 --> 00:40:55,458
What?

587
00:40:57,916 --> 00:40:58,833
No.

588
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,666
What is that… What?

589
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,166
No! Listen to me!

590
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:05,708
I got someone else's food.
Don't you understand?

591
00:41:05,791 --> 00:41:10,791
I'm hosting an event where people
are expecting canapés and champagne.

592
00:41:10,875 --> 00:41:14,208
All I've got is
instant noodles and energy drinks!

593
00:41:15,041 --> 00:41:16,208
Oh Christ!

594
00:41:16,291 --> 00:41:18,375
[lounge music playing in background]

595
00:41:18,458 --> 00:41:21,000
Welcome. Welcome.

596
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,916
Hi.

597
00:41:24,833 --> 00:41:25,708
Wha…

598
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,833
What? God!

599
00:41:28,708 --> 00:41:30,416
-[doorbell buzzing]
-[gasps]

600
00:41:31,041 --> 00:41:33,166
[female] Chamonix has become
terribly plebeian now.

601
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:35,208
[male] Yeah. It's like a supermarket.

602
00:41:35,291 --> 00:41:37,291
[indistinct chattering]

603
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:42,041
The size is okay,
but the layout is just confusing.

604
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:43,666
-Don't you think?
-[whining]

605
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:47,791
Daddy, Daddy, look at me. [laughing]

606
00:41:54,416 --> 00:41:55,750
Oh! Oh dear.

607
00:41:55,833 --> 00:41:58,291
[inhales] Hmm. Oh.

608
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:00,333
[gasps]

609
00:42:03,666 --> 00:42:04,791
[clears throat]

610
00:42:05,916 --> 00:42:08,625
-[crying]
-[female 2] Oh, Isobel. Shh.

611
00:42:08,708 --> 00:42:10,791
[lounge music playing]

612
00:42:10,875 --> 00:42:11,750
Right.

613
00:42:12,375 --> 00:42:15,416
Now, for me, the sitting/dining room

614
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,708
is the beating heart of the house.

615
00:42:18,875 --> 00:42:22,416
It's a place to rewind
after a long, stressful day.

616
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:26,166
Comforting, luxurious.
A family room, you could call it.

617
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,375
[Isobel crying]

618
00:42:27,458 --> 00:42:28,708
Just to reiterate,

619
00:42:28,791 --> 00:42:32,083
fittings and furnishings
are negotiable in the price.

620
00:42:32,166 --> 00:42:35,291
But I think, like me,
you appreciate excellence,

621
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:38,750
and that is what is being presented
to you this afternoon.

622
00:42:38,833 --> 00:42:39,875
[crying continues]

623
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:43,708
I think we can all imagine ourselves
stepping out onto the patio

624
00:42:43,791 --> 00:42:46,875
and having a chilled glass of wine
in the evening.

625
00:42:46,958 --> 00:42:50,000
Maybe some snacks in a bowl.

626
00:42:51,833 --> 00:42:54,291
[female 2 sighs]
Would you please shut the door?

627
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:01,208
-[scoffs]
-Canapé?

628
00:43:01,291 --> 00:43:02,833
Uh, no, thanks.

629
00:43:02,916 --> 00:43:03,875
Oh.

630
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:09,083
[male 2] Come on, darling. Let's go.

631
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,500
[breathing heavily, moans]

632
00:43:13,416 --> 00:43:16,583
Get yourself… get yourself together.

633
00:43:16,666 --> 00:43:18,125
Come on. Come on.

634
00:43:18,208 --> 00:43:19,458
[doorknob jiggling]

635
00:43:20,541 --> 00:43:22,541
[sighs, groans]

636
00:43:23,958 --> 00:43:24,833
Right.

637
00:43:26,541 --> 00:43:27,708
[inhales]

638
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:33,625
-Yeah. Oh… Okay. Okay!
-[upbeat funk music playing]

639
00:43:36,583 --> 00:43:39,000
[indistinct chattering]

640
00:43:41,083 --> 00:43:43,750
[contractor] Wonderfully elegant,
isn't it? [humming]

641
00:43:43,833 --> 00:43:46,791
-Carry on. Carry on. Enjoy yourselves.
-[squeals, giggles]

642
00:43:51,125 --> 00:43:54,125
I call this kitchen "The World's Kitchen"

643
00:43:54,208 --> 00:43:56,625
because of the participation
of so many countries

644
00:43:56,708 --> 00:43:58,708
in its design and inception.

645
00:43:58,791 --> 00:44:02,000
You'll all have noticed
the gray veining in the central island.

646
00:44:02,083 --> 00:44:06,541
The very last marble to be quarried
from the Carrara region in Italy.

647
00:44:06,625 --> 00:44:07,583
Pretty special.

648
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:11,791
We're walking upon
Galala marble from Egypt.

649
00:44:11,875 --> 00:44:14,333
You can feel that ancient history,
can't you?

650
00:44:14,416 --> 00:44:16,250
You can almost hear the Egyptians.

651
00:44:16,333 --> 00:44:20,500
The sleek cabinets are Scandinavian
but manufactured in Germany.

652
00:44:20,583 --> 00:44:23,458
So, finesse but also durability.

653
00:44:24,041 --> 00:44:26,250
As in all the rooms,
lighting can be operated

654
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:29,625
through your smartphone
or a virtual assistant of your choice,

655
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:32,833
whereupon you can access
any number of tonal colors.

656
00:44:32,916 --> 00:44:33,750
[applauding]

657
00:44:33,833 --> 00:44:37,250
But really, the pièce de résistance
of not just the kitchen

658
00:44:37,333 --> 00:44:39,208
but the entire house, in my opinion,

659
00:44:39,291 --> 00:44:42,375
is that one thing that none of us
can live without these days.

660
00:44:42,458 --> 00:44:45,458
Now, you all probably noticed
that we had a situation with the catering,

661
00:44:45,541 --> 00:44:47,458
which I do apologize for.

662
00:44:47,541 --> 00:44:49,291
But even without a chicken

663
00:44:49,375 --> 00:44:53,583
and as a statement of the person you are
or the person that you want to be,

664
00:44:53,666 --> 00:44:56,583
I think we can all see
the majesty of this,

665
00:44:56,666 --> 00:44:59,041
this exquisite kitchen appliance.

666
00:44:59,125 --> 00:45:01,916
The Châteaux Rotisserie Oven.

667
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:13,625
[gasps] Mmm. Ah!

668
00:45:13,708 --> 00:45:15,708
-[sighs]
-[music skipping]

669
00:45:15,791 --> 00:45:17,666
[high-pitched ringing]

670
00:45:18,416 --> 00:45:19,416
[sighs]

671
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,083
Um, the… the Wi-Fi seems to be acting up.

672
00:45:22,166 --> 00:45:23,000
[groans]

673
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:23,916
Ow!

674
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:36,583
[elderly male] We love
what you have done to the house.

675
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:39,708
[contractor] You do?

676
00:45:41,083 --> 00:45:42,750
Very, very much.

677
00:45:43,666 --> 00:45:47,416
Is the furniture included
in the higher price?

678
00:45:48,541 --> 00:45:49,458
[contractor] Yes.

679
00:45:51,041 --> 00:45:52,625
Wonderful.

680
00:45:54,833 --> 00:46:00,083
Can we ask you some specific questions?

681
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:03,416
[contractor] Yes, of course.
Uh, ask me anything at all.

682
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:08,875
[inhales] Is that a crepe weave fabric
on the couches?

683
00:46:08,958 --> 00:46:09,791
[chittering]

684
00:46:09,875 --> 00:46:12,791
[contractor] I have the brochure
in my office. I can check.

685
00:46:12,875 --> 00:46:18,000
What building insulation
have you used in the house?

686
00:46:18,083 --> 00:46:21,000
Natural fibrous materials?

687
00:46:21,083 --> 00:46:24,666
[contractor] It's a mixture
of wool, paper, and cotton, actually.

688
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:27,625
Oh. Nice.

689
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:37,000
[chuckling]

690
00:46:38,125 --> 00:46:39,625
Oh. Uh…

691
00:46:40,458 --> 00:46:42,458
Can you excuse me for a second, please?

692
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:46,875
Yes, bye. Bye. I'll be here if you, uh…

693
00:46:47,958 --> 00:46:49,958
[elderly male] Delectable rugs.

694
00:46:50,958 --> 00:46:53,375
[elderly female] So insulated

695
00:46:53,458 --> 00:46:55,625
and… and comfortable.

696
00:46:56,541 --> 00:46:58,041
[chittering]

697
00:47:05,916 --> 00:47:07,916
[chuckling softly]

698
00:47:08,666 --> 00:47:09,625
All good?

699
00:47:10,291 --> 00:47:12,333
What funny shoes.

700
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,416
You should take them off.
No need for them now.

701
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,458
Yeah, I guess you're right.

702
00:47:18,541 --> 00:47:21,750
Can we have a look at the show bedroom?

703
00:47:22,375 --> 00:47:25,000
Yeah, it's just through there. Feel free.

704
00:47:25,083 --> 00:47:27,958
I'll be downstairs
if you need anything at all. Just call.

705
00:47:28,041 --> 00:47:32,500
We're very interested in your house.

706
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:35,208
That's great news.

707
00:47:35,291 --> 00:47:38,416
Extremely interested.

708
00:47:40,541 --> 00:47:41,500
Yes!

709
00:47:44,291 --> 00:47:46,208
Now where is that little shit?

710
00:47:46,291 --> 00:47:47,583
Come on. Come to…

711
00:47:47,666 --> 00:47:49,041
[chittering]

712
00:47:49,125 --> 00:47:50,166
Oh Christ!

713
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:51,375
Come on then.

714
00:47:51,458 --> 00:47:55,750
[groaning, straining]

715
00:47:55,833 --> 00:47:56,916
Just bounce.

716
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,541
[exhales, coughing]

717
00:47:59,625 --> 00:48:02,333
[panting, coughing]

718
00:48:02,416 --> 00:48:03,250
[sniffling]

719
00:48:09,333 --> 00:48:11,500
[chittering, screeching]

720
00:48:16,875 --> 00:48:17,833
[contractor] Hello?

721
00:48:20,208 --> 00:48:21,208
Hello?

722
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:31,875
Hello?

723
00:48:42,083 --> 00:48:42,958
[contractor] Oh.

724
00:48:45,458 --> 00:48:46,583
What are you doing?

725
00:48:47,708 --> 00:48:49,541
We thought we'd turn in.

726
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:51,958
What? You mean sleep here?

727
00:48:52,041 --> 00:48:55,166
Well, it is a bedroom.

728
00:48:56,833 --> 00:49:01,458
We're extremely interested in the house.

729
00:49:01,541 --> 00:49:03,000
Right. Uh--

730
00:49:03,083 --> 00:49:06,875
Could we trouble you for two cups of tea?

731
00:49:18,833 --> 00:49:20,125
[clicks tongue] Well,

732
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:22,541
good night then.

733
00:49:24,083 --> 00:49:25,041
Sleep well.

734
00:49:30,125 --> 00:49:31,583
[contractor] Jesus, Erica.

[water splashing]

739
00:49:56,833 --> 00:50:00,875
[contractor] Tell the others at the bank
I have buyers secured.

740
00:50:00,958 --> 00:50:04,083
Yeah, thank you. Thank you.
Yeah, I know. It's fantastic.

741
00:50:04,916 --> 00:50:07,166
I'm in the city, walking into a meeting

742
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:09,791
with their solicitors
right at this moment.

743
00:50:10,416 --> 00:50:12,875
Sorry, what? The name of the solicitors?

744
00:50:12,958 --> 00:50:15,916
Mmm, let me check that.
I'll get back to you.

745
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,291
[sniffing]

746
00:50:17,375 --> 00:50:19,250
[high-pitched humming on TV]

747
00:50:21,416 --> 00:50:27,208
[elderly male] Mmm, our television is
very difficult to work.

748
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:31,625
[spluttering] I… I can take a look--

749
00:50:31,708 --> 00:50:34,041
Do you have any more canapés?

750
00:50:35,208 --> 00:50:36,375
No, I'm afraid not.

751
00:50:36,458 --> 00:50:38,958
What, with the viewing
being officially over.

752
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:48,791
[elderly male] We are extremely interested
in the house.

753
00:50:48,875 --> 00:50:52,041
Yes, but exactly how interested are you?

754
00:50:54,125 --> 00:50:58,333
Perhaps we should start negotiating
with your representatives?

755
00:50:59,125 --> 00:51:01,458
Yes, we should, really.

756
00:51:02,041 --> 00:51:02,958
Really?

757
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,208
Well, maybe you could get your solicitor
on the phone? Invite him over.

758
00:51:08,291 --> 00:51:12,500
We should invite them over
for some food, straightaway.

759
00:51:12,583 --> 00:51:13,458
Good.

760
00:51:14,875 --> 00:51:17,958
If you could find any food, that is.

761
00:51:20,125 --> 00:51:23,708
[host on TV] A perfect example
of what we call black mold on the wall.

762
00:51:23,791 --> 00:51:26,041
Now, this is an outside wall,

763
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:30,416
and you can see the spots growing up here
on the surface of the wall…

764
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,375
[elderly couple chuckling]

765
00:51:32,458 --> 00:51:34,416
[host] …and even the ceiling.

766
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:37,750
The mold's, generally speaking, black,
but sometimes white--

767
00:51:37,833 --> 00:51:40,583
They are going absolutely nowhere.

768
00:51:40,666 --> 00:51:41,791
It's insane.

769
00:51:42,458 --> 00:51:45,416
Because I had no one else to call but you!

770
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:50,333
Please don't put the phone down.
I've invested my whole life in this house.

771
00:51:50,416 --> 00:51:51,875
You know that, darling.

772
00:51:53,416 --> 00:51:55,458
Okay. Okay, I'm sorry.

773
00:51:55,541 --> 00:51:58,166
I will never ever call you darling again,
sweetheart.

-[music ends abruptly]
-[blow-dryer whirring]

795
00:54:29,875 --> 00:54:33,791
All right. It's pretty obvious you have
no intention of buying this house.

796
00:54:33,875 --> 00:54:36,250
You think you can just lounge around
like this forever?

797
00:54:36,333 --> 00:54:38,583
Eating my food, drinking my drinks?

798
00:54:39,083 --> 00:54:40,041
No!

799
00:54:40,541 --> 00:54:41,375
[gasps]

800
00:54:43,708 --> 00:54:47,291
I'm ringing the police.
I'm ringing the police right now!

801
00:54:47,375 --> 00:54:49,000
The phone is ringing.

802
00:54:50,333 --> 00:54:54,416
Yes. I'd like to report a…
Well, I'm not too sure what it is.

803
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,291
A breaking and entering situation
without the breaking.

804
00:54:57,375 --> 00:54:58,375
[doorbell buzzing]

805
00:54:58,458 --> 00:55:01,666
An entering and then a refusal to leave,
let's call it.

806
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:02,833
A hostage-taking,

807
00:55:02,916 --> 00:55:05,625
in which the house I'm trying to sell
is being held hostage. It's…

808
00:55:05,708 --> 00:55:07,958
-[doorbell buzzing]
-It's confusing, yeah.

809
00:55:08,041 --> 00:55:11,375
I just need you to send
a couple of police officers over quickly

810
00:55:11,458 --> 00:55:12,875
to Van Schoonbeek Lane.

811
00:55:13,375 --> 00:55:17,041
Christ, that was quick.
They're upstairs in the bath.

812
00:55:17,666 --> 00:55:21,000
[male officer] Do you have a dentist
called Dr. Jafri, sir?

813
00:55:21,083 --> 00:55:23,500
Yeah, has… has something happened to him?

814
00:55:23,583 --> 00:55:25,541
My God! Is he all right? I… I…

815
00:55:25,625 --> 00:55:27,583
[male officer] We've heard from Dr. Jafri

816
00:55:27,666 --> 00:55:30,583
that you've been telephoning him
at all times of the day, sir.

817
00:55:30,666 --> 00:55:32,000
Yeah. So, what?

818
00:55:32,083 --> 00:55:34,916
[female officer] You're sharing with him
personal details about your life,

819
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,416
which he, as your dentist,
has absolutely no interest in.

820
00:55:39,125 --> 00:55:39,958
Right. Uh--

821
00:55:40,041 --> 00:55:41,708
[male officer]
You're overfamiliar with him,

822
00:55:41,791 --> 00:55:45,416
and occasionally, you call him
"darling" or even "sweetheart."

823
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:48,291
All of that is true,
but none of it's important.

824
00:55:48,375 --> 00:55:51,875
I've two guests upstairs in a bath
who are refusing to leave my house.

825
00:55:51,958 --> 00:55:55,500
[male officer] You call Dr. Jafri again,
and he will take you to court.

826
00:55:55,583 --> 00:55:56,791
Do you understand, sir?

827
00:55:56,875 --> 00:55:59,333
Take me to court? Come back here!

828
00:55:59,416 --> 00:56:03,083
I've done absolutely nothing wrong.
What are you talking about?

829
00:56:03,666 --> 00:56:04,500
[sighs]

830
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,625

Oh, don't… don't mind me. Yeah. Oh.

833
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:22,500
They've been looking forward
to seeing our house.

834
00:56:22,583 --> 00:56:26,166
-Your house?
-They are our family, visiting.

835
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:27,625
Your family?!

836
00:56:27,708 --> 00:56:30,333
They're actually very nice people.

837
00:56:30,416 --> 00:56:33,666
They lived here before, you know.

838
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:35,125

I'll give you tea, you bloody vermin.
Yeah. Yeah. Are you ready? Are you ready?

846
00:56:53,625 --> 00:56:57,000
A nice cup of tea?
Nice cup… nice cup… nice cup of…

[screams, gasps]

902
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:07,291
[groans]

903
01:03:11,083 --> 01:03:11,916
[exhales]

904
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:13,333
[grunts]

905
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,750
[sighs]

906
01:03:17,083 --> 01:03:18,666
[yelling, grunting] Ah!

907
01:03:19,833 --> 01:03:21,708
[groaning]

908
01:03:25,541 --> 01:03:26,750
[door unlocking]

909
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:31,125
Ah. G… good morning, Rosa.

910
01:03:31,208 --> 01:03:32,875
It's the afternoon.

911
01:03:32,958 --> 01:03:33,875
Oh. [chuckling]

912
01:03:33,958 --> 01:03:36,125
-Okay.
-You know what day it is today?

913
01:03:36,208 --> 01:03:40,041
Um, is it… Wednesday?

914
01:03:40,125 --> 01:03:41,750
[sighs] It's rent day.

915
01:03:41,833 --> 01:03:43,625
Oh, uh, are we still doing that?

916
01:03:43,708 --> 01:03:45,375
Yes, we're still doing that!

917
01:03:45,458 --> 01:03:48,916
Um, when was the last time I… I paid rent?

918
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,458
With actual money?

919
01:03:51,958 --> 01:03:53,291
Twelve weeks ago.

920
01:03:53,375 --> 01:03:57,250
Ah. So, long time. [chuckling]

921
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:58,416
Yeah.

922
01:03:58,500 --> 01:03:59,541
Well… [sighs]

923
01:03:59,625 --> 01:04:02,291
…just so you know,
the shower water is brown again.

924
01:04:02,375 --> 01:04:03,458
Okay.

925
01:04:03,541 --> 01:04:07,583
I didn't wanna say, but it just has
this really weird slippery texture.

926
01:04:07,666 --> 01:04:10,291
Yeah, I know. It affected my paste.

927
01:04:10,375 --> 01:04:12,500
Yeah, it would do.
You can feel it on my arm.

928
01:04:12,583 --> 01:04:15,500
You know, if you paid me in money,
I'd have the resources

929
01:04:15,583 --> 01:04:18,000
to get the proper equipment
to fix the plumbing.

930
01:04:18,083 --> 01:04:19,333
Uh… [sighs]

931
01:04:19,416 --> 01:04:21,583
-I can pay you with fish?
-[Rosa] No. No more fish.

932
01:04:21,666 --> 01:04:24,208
You have to eat,
and fish are an important source of--

933
01:04:24,291 --> 01:04:28,958
Elias! For God's sake,
just find me my rent. Okay?

934
01:04:30,541 --> 01:04:31,625
[exhales]

935
01:04:31,708 --> 01:04:32,583
Okay.

936
01:04:34,333 --> 01:04:36,291
Uh, I think I'll go and dry my fur.

937
01:04:37,083 --> 01:04:38,166
Yeah, go on, then.

938
01:04:43,458 --> 01:04:45,333
-[beetle scuttling]
-[exhales deeply]

939
01:04:45,416 --> 01:04:49,416
Affix floorboard to the other floorboards.

940
01:04:50,541 --> 01:04:51,375
Uh…

941
01:04:52,625 --> 01:04:56,125
[relaxing sitar music playing]

942
01:04:56,208 --> 01:04:57,541
[female humming]

943
01:04:57,625 --> 01:04:58,541
Hey.

944
01:05:00,375 --> 01:05:01,291
[door closes]

945
01:05:02,250 --> 01:05:04,333
[female continues humming]

946
01:05:08,666 --> 01:05:09,541
[Rosa] Jen.

947
01:05:11,958 --> 01:05:12,791
Jen!

948
01:05:15,375 --> 01:05:16,625
[sighs]

949
01:05:17,208 --> 01:05:19,208
-[Jen vocalizes]
-[music abruptly stops]

950
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:20,875
Morning!

951
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:22,666
It's three o'clock.

952
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:23,583
Hmm.

953
01:05:23,666 --> 01:05:27,583
And soon it'll be four and then five!

954
01:05:27,666 --> 01:05:29,708
Yeah, that's how it works.

955
01:05:29,791 --> 01:05:32,958
Oh, I gave up on time years ago.
[chuckles]

956
01:05:33,041 --> 01:05:34,875
Right. Who needs it?

957
01:05:34,958 --> 01:05:38,583
[gasps] But today is rent day. Am I right?

958
01:05:38,666 --> 01:05:42,208
Yeah. I'm really looking forward
to being paid my rent.

959
01:05:42,291 --> 01:05:43,333
[chuckling]

960
01:05:43,416 --> 01:05:47,250
Here it is. The obsidian crystal.

961
01:05:47,333 --> 01:05:49,916
A reliever of emotional blockage

962
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,625
and promoter of compassion

963
01:05:51,708 --> 01:05:54,708
to help you find your true sense of self.

964
01:05:54,791 --> 01:05:58,250
You've given me ten of these already
and still no money.

965
01:05:58,958 --> 01:05:59,791
[inhales]

966
01:05:59,875 --> 01:06:00,833
Let's eat.

967
01:06:01,625 --> 01:06:03,916
Of course I knew
it was going to be difficult.

968
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,791
I mean, the scale alone is enormous,

969
01:06:06,875 --> 01:06:11,708
but every day, I can see
the real potential of this house.

970
01:06:11,791 --> 01:06:12,750
[inhales]

971
01:06:12,833 --> 01:06:14,583
And if only I had tenants.

972
01:06:14,666 --> 01:06:16,708
Well, they all left.

973
01:06:16,791 --> 01:06:19,458
-Yeah, I know they left.
-Because of the flooding.

974
01:06:21,875 --> 01:06:23,708
There's still me and Elias, of course.

975
01:06:23,791 --> 01:06:25,791
Yeah, but I'm talking about good tenants.

976
01:06:25,875 --> 01:06:28,375
Proper ones, who would pay me
with actual money,

977
01:06:28,458 --> 01:06:30,250
instead of fish and stones.

978
01:06:30,333 --> 01:06:31,166
Crystals.

979
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:33,708
I can't buy supplies with crystals.

980
01:06:33,791 --> 01:06:35,791
You can realign your energy chakras.

981
01:06:35,875 --> 01:06:39,500
Yeah, but it won't fix the electrics
or whatever else needs doing.

982
01:06:39,583 --> 01:06:40,666
You could try.

983
01:06:41,708 --> 01:06:42,875
It wouldn't hurt.

984
01:06:42,958 --> 01:06:44,208
[sighs]

985
01:06:44,916 --> 01:06:47,166
I've always loved this house, you know.

986
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:48,083
Hmm.

987
01:06:48,166 --> 01:06:49,875
It's devotion, really.

988
01:06:49,958 --> 01:06:53,291
How wonderful it could be.

989
01:06:53,375 --> 01:06:54,208
Right.

990
01:06:54,291 --> 01:06:55,291
I'd smarten it up

991
01:06:55,375 --> 01:06:59,208
and then get residents in
to pay for further restoration.

992
01:06:59,291 --> 01:07:01,583
Then, over time, you move everyone out.

993
01:07:01,666 --> 01:07:05,250
And then the house will be finished.
It will be… [inhales deeply]

994
01:07:06,041 --> 01:07:07,166
…stunning.

995
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:09,958
-The house deserves it.
-[Jen humming mantra]

996
01:07:10,041 --> 01:07:15,291
Right now, I just need
the, um, right… support.

997
01:07:15,833 --> 01:07:18,875
Yeah, yeah.
I… I just don't have the right support.

998
01:07:19,958 --> 01:07:21,958
[continues humming mantra]

999
01:07:23,125 --> 01:07:24,416
Ah. Oh!

1000
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:25,666
Um…

1001
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:29,041
Have I spoken to you
about my spirit partner?

1002
01:07:29,125 --> 01:07:30,916
What do you mean? A boyfriend?

1003
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,333
That term doesn't describe
what he is, really.

1004
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:35,208
Okay. What about him?

1005
01:07:35,291 --> 01:07:38,166
-He's arriving tomorrow!
-Does he have any money?

1006
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:41,833
We met eight years ago
at a Tibetan throat music workshop.

1007
01:07:41,916 --> 01:07:44,625
We've been communing ever since
on the astral plane.

1008
01:07:44,708 --> 01:07:45,708
No money then.

1009
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:47,625
I wouldn't think so, no.

1010
01:07:47,708 --> 01:07:49,250
But he's a wonder, Rosa.

1011
01:07:49,333 --> 01:07:53,208
-A celestial force. Truly.
-Yeah, well, I'm not running a charity.

1012
01:07:53,291 --> 01:07:55,708
I'll be telling him that
and making myself clear.

1013
01:07:55,791 --> 01:07:57,291
I'm sure he'll have his uses.

1014
01:07:57,375 --> 01:07:59,500
Yeah, sure. Right.

1015
01:07:59,583 --> 01:08:03,083
Oh, I was wondering
about, um, the shower in my bathroom.

1016
01:08:03,166 --> 01:08:04,625
What about it?

1017
01:08:04,708 --> 01:08:08,208
It's been making some terrible noises,
and the water's brown again.

1018
01:08:08,291 --> 01:08:10,208
[sighs, groans]

1019
01:08:12,166 --> 01:08:15,916
[humming]

1020
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,875
[showerhead sputtering]

1021
01:08:17,958 --> 01:08:19,000
Hmm.

1022
01:08:19,625 --> 01:08:21,250
[grunts softly]

1023
01:08:21,791 --> 01:08:22,625
[sputtering]

1024
01:08:24,375 --> 01:08:26,000
[clanking]

1025
01:08:26,083 --> 01:08:28,250
[grunting]

1026
01:08:28,333 --> 01:08:29,833
[showerhead rattling]

1027
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:31,416
Oh.

1028
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:33,041
[shrieks]

1029
01:08:35,625 --> 01:08:36,875
[classical music playing]

1030

[inhales, grunts]

1031
01:08:43,791 --> 01:08:46,166
[grunts]

1032
01:08:47,583 --> 01:08:48,458
There we go.

1033
01:08:53,958 --> 01:08:56,708
[upbeat piano music playing]

1034
01:08:57,541 --> 01:09:00,375
[Elias and Jen laughing]

1035
01:09:02,166 --> 01:09:04,166
[laughing continues]

1036
01:09:15,625 --> 01:09:17,708
[Jen sighs, chuckles]

1037
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:19,833
Oh.

1038
01:09:20,458 --> 01:09:21,291
Hey.

1039
01:09:22,708 --> 01:09:24,875
-[scoffs]
-[Jen continues chuckling]

1040
01:09:28,791 --> 01:09:30,791
[Rosa sighs, scoffs]

1041
01:09:33,166 --> 01:09:34,500
[sighs]

1042
01:09:38,583 --> 01:09:43,500
[dramatic music playing]

1043
01:09:45,666 --> 01:09:51,333
[Tibetan chanting]

1044
01:09:52,916 --> 01:09:56,041
[creaking]

1045
01:10:00,583 --> 01:10:02,666
Hmm? [grunts]

1046
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:03,875
What… what the…

1047
01:10:03,958 --> 01:10:05,458
[chanting continues]

1048
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:08,708
What the…

1049
01:10:27,375 --> 01:10:29,208
[coughing]

1050
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:30,333
-[clapping]
-[Elias] Whoa!

1051
01:10:30,416 --> 01:10:31,708
[Jen] How wonderful!

1052
01:10:31,791 --> 01:10:33,333
[Elias] That was amazing!

1053
01:10:33,416 --> 01:10:36,458
Oh, that's just a little something
I picked up in Tibet.

1054
01:10:36,541 --> 01:10:39,500
[chuckling] No, no. No applause, please.

1055
01:10:39,583 --> 01:10:42,583
I am merely a conduit to the melody.

1056
01:10:43,083 --> 01:10:45,708
A portal to a different music.

1057
01:10:45,791 --> 01:10:47,333
Another dance.

1058
01:10:47,416 --> 01:10:49,250
A messenger, basically.

1059
01:10:50,083 --> 01:10:51,791
How long have you been traveling?

1060
01:10:51,875 --> 01:10:54,625
Always. Always traveling, my child.

1061
01:10:54,708 --> 01:10:57,666
And yet, with each second,
the journey shortens

1062
01:10:57,750 --> 01:11:00,708
as I get a little bit closer to this…

1063
01:11:00,791 --> 01:11:01,625
[gasps]

1064
01:11:01,708 --> 01:11:04,916
…synthesis of celestial grace.

1065
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,041
[gasps] He's talking about me.

1066
01:11:08,125 --> 01:11:10,833
I brought you some earthly gifts, angel.

1067
01:11:12,125 --> 01:11:15,416
For purification,
the banishment of discord,

1068
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:18,791
and a rebalancing
of one's physical dwelling.

1069
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:21,250
-Mmm.
-[coughing]

1070
01:11:21,333 --> 01:11:22,541
[clears throat]

1071
01:11:23,333 --> 01:11:24,500
I didn't get your name.

1072
01:11:24,583 --> 01:11:25,958
Hmm? [gasps]

1073
01:11:26,041 --> 01:11:27,166
How rude of me.

1074
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:31,375
Rosa, this is Cosmos.

1075
01:11:31,458 --> 01:11:32,458
[scoffs]

1076
01:11:32,541 --> 01:11:35,916
And how long
are you planning to stay, Cosmos?

1077
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,041
Ah, there are never any plans with me.

1078
01:11:38,583 --> 01:11:42,708
There's only moments
snatched from the wind.

1079
01:11:43,708 --> 01:11:46,583
-What are you talking about?
-It's not like we're short of room.

1080
01:11:46,666 --> 01:11:47,916
The house is huge.

1081
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,750
A traveler cannot be bound
by earthly walls, Jen.

1082
01:11:51,833 --> 01:11:54,416
I sleep in the open.

1083
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:55,875
Oh.

1084
01:11:57,833 --> 01:11:58,666
[gasps]

1085
01:11:59,458 --> 01:12:00,333
[gasps]

1086
01:12:00,416 --> 01:12:03,250
-Whoa! Wow! Jeez Louise!
-[exhales]

1087
01:12:03,333 --> 01:12:05,583
-Mm-hmm.
-What a day!

1088
01:12:05,666 --> 01:12:07,541
Let me prepare some food from my garden.

1089
01:12:07,625 --> 01:12:09,125
[Cosmos chuckling]

1090
01:12:09,833 --> 01:12:12,541
Go on, you can go in if you like.
Have a look around.

1091
01:12:12,625 --> 01:12:14,750
Yes, please. [chuckling]

1092
01:12:14,833 --> 01:12:20,666
-Whoa. It's really cool in here.
-[sniffing] I'm sensing a negative energy.

1093
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:22,916
Yeah, it's coming from me.

1094
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:27,666
Mmm, you're protective of Jen,
and for that, you have my gratitude.

1095
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:31,000
Actually, I'm protective of my property.

1096
01:12:31,083 --> 01:12:33,916
So, um, when will you be getting off it?

1097
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,541
[groans, inhales]

1098
01:12:35,625 --> 01:12:38,708
I will move on when the mist has lifted.

1099
01:12:39,791 --> 01:12:42,625
Probably. But only time will tell.

1100
01:12:42,708 --> 01:12:46,041
Yeah, well, I should be charging you
for pitching that tent.

1101
01:12:46,125 --> 01:12:47,291
[chuckling] Charging.

1102
01:12:47,375 --> 01:12:48,291
What is money

1103
01:12:48,375 --> 01:12:52,750
but some physical denomination
of coin and note?

1104
01:12:52,833 --> 01:12:55,083
That's exactly what it is.

1105
01:12:55,166 --> 01:12:58,625
I move in an ocean of bartering myself.

1106
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:01,625
Oh yeah?
And what is it that you barter with?

1107
01:13:01,708 --> 01:13:02,583
[gasps]

1108
01:13:04,291 --> 01:13:05,291
My skills.

1109
01:13:05,375 --> 01:13:06,791
[gasps]

1110
01:13:07,375 --> 01:13:11,958
So, what you're looking at right now
is the finish, obviously, the dream.

1111
01:13:12,041 --> 01:13:15,583
Everybody left when the rains came,
so I need to get some new paying tenants.

1112
01:13:15,666 --> 01:13:18,333
Then I'll have
some real money to play with.

1113
01:13:18,416 --> 01:13:20,750
I already have
a ton of paint and wallpaper.

1114
01:13:21,250 --> 01:13:22,416
Hmm.

1115
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:24,583
You must begin with the roots.

1116
01:13:24,666 --> 01:13:26,375
Right, exactly!

1117
01:13:26,458 --> 01:13:28,500
The… the heating, electrics.

1118
01:13:28,583 --> 01:13:32,000
I've got some problems
with this brown water from the taps.

1119
01:13:32,083 --> 01:13:36,083
You have to nourish the soul of the house
to unleash its potential.

1120
01:13:36,166 --> 01:13:37,000
Right!

1121
01:13:37,083 --> 01:13:39,166
Enliven its chakra.

1122
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:40,416
Ye… Mmm.

1123
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:44,000
Maybe you can start with the plumbing?

1124
01:13:44,083 --> 01:13:45,083
Mmm.

1125
01:13:45,166 --> 01:13:47,375
Plumbing is a little invasive.

1126
01:13:47,458 --> 01:13:49,875
I would like
to get to know the house first,

1127
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:52,791
possibly through some gentle carpentry.

1128
01:13:53,416 --> 01:13:55,458
I… I have a floorboard

1129
01:13:55,541 --> 01:13:57,791
that needs replacing
in the upstairs corridor?

1130
01:13:57,875 --> 01:13:59,916
Perfect. I'll make a start tomorrow.

1131
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,166
Yes! [squealing]

1132
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:02,291
Um…

1133
01:14:03,166 --> 01:14:06,125
I mean, um, thank you. Uh…

1134
01:14:06,833 --> 01:14:08,375
This is going to be great.

1135
01:14:09,333 --> 01:14:12,958
Oh, the reawakening
will be beautiful, Rosa.

1136
01:14:13,041 --> 01:14:14,083
[grunts]

1137
01:14:14,166 --> 01:14:15,291
Beautiful.

1138
01:14:15,375 --> 01:14:16,916
[sniffing] Uh…

1139
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,041
[gagging, coughing]

1140
01:14:19,125 --> 01:14:20,875
-[Cosmos chanting]
-[Elias] Yes.

1141
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:23,625
Yeah.

1142
01:14:23,708 --> 01:14:26,250
[Jen chanting]

1143
01:14:28,833 --> 01:14:30,083
[Elias laughing]

1144
01:14:30,166 --> 01:14:31,958
Chika-chika-chika-chika.

1145
01:14:32,041 --> 01:14:34,791
-Come on, your turn!
-Oh, no. No. I… I don't.

1146
01:14:34,875 --> 01:14:35,750
-Come on!
-Ooh!

1147
01:14:35,833 --> 01:14:37,875
-[Elias] There you go.
-Come on, Rosa!

1148
01:14:39,083 --> 01:14:40,958
-[humming]
-[chuckling]

1149
01:14:41,041 --> 01:14:42,666
[vocalizing]

1150
01:14:42,750 --> 01:14:43,583
Woo!

1151
01:14:43,666 --> 01:14:46,375
-[laughing]
-[humming]

1152
01:14:53,666 --> 01:14:56,125
-[wind whooshing]
-[crickets chirping]

1153
01:15:02,916 --> 01:15:08,000
[banging]

1154
01:15:08,083 --> 01:15:10,833
[exhales, sighs]

1155
01:15:10,916 --> 01:15:13,458
-[wood clattering]
-[banging]

1156
01:15:14,041 --> 01:15:15,541
-[sighs]
-[wood clattering]

1157
01:15:15,625 --> 01:15:17,458
What the… [sighs]

1158
01:15:17,541 --> 01:15:19,041
What the hell's going on?

1159
01:15:19,125 --> 01:15:22,833
Ha! Someone had a bit too much to drink.
It's the middle of the day!

1160
01:15:22,916 --> 01:15:26,125
-What are you doing up there?
-Seize it! Embrace it!

1161
01:15:26,208 --> 01:15:28,541
-[scoffs]
-[Cosmos laughing]

1162
01:15:28,625 --> 01:15:30,541
Oh yeah, man. That's banging.

1163
01:15:30,625 --> 01:15:31,791
No!

1164
01:15:33,291 --> 01:15:35,541
[whimpering] No.

1165
01:15:35,625 --> 01:15:38,000
Oh! The water's still brown, Rosa!

1166
01:15:38,083 --> 01:15:38,916
[Rosa] Oh.

1167
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:42,500
Oh! No! Oh no!

1168
01:15:44,083 --> 01:15:46,166
[breathing heavily, shrieking]

1169
01:15:47,458 --> 01:15:50,208
-This isn't the plan! My plan!
-[drum beating]

1170
01:15:50,291 --> 01:15:53,291
Have you forgotten everything
we were talking about?

1171
01:15:53,375 --> 01:15:56,000
I'm sensing that negative energy again.

1172
01:15:56,083 --> 01:15:58,083
You've destroyed the corridor!

1173
01:15:58,166 --> 01:15:59,541
Realigned it.

1174
01:15:59,625 --> 01:16:01,958
You've pulled up every floorboard!

1175
01:16:02,041 --> 01:16:04,625
Yes, but for a boat, Rosa. A boat.

1176
01:16:04,708 --> 01:16:07,666
You have a boat! You have a boat outside!

1177
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:10,750
-Well, the boat's for me!
-Right. The boat's for Elias.

1178
01:16:10,833 --> 01:16:14,708
Ugh! Oh God! What was in that wine, Jen?

1179
01:16:14,791 --> 01:16:17,208
Take it in one go. It's a bit pungent.

1180
01:16:17,291 --> 01:16:18,666
[slurping]

1181
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:21,625
[gagging, gasping]

1182
01:16:21,708 --> 01:16:24,166
Oh! I've got a nonaggressive solution
to the plumbing.

1183
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:25,958
[gasps] That's great news.

1184
01:16:26,041 --> 01:16:28,208
I need some mint, a cabbage, two vials,

1185
01:16:28,291 --> 01:16:33,333
this drum to signify a heartbeat,
and a tambourine for affectation.

1186
01:16:33,416 --> 01:16:36,458
Get out of my house! Get out! Get out!

1187
01:16:36,541 --> 01:16:39,833
Oh! Yes, Rosa! Harness that strength!

1188
01:16:39,916 --> 01:16:42,375
-[Tibetan chanting]
-[humming]

1189
01:16:42,458 --> 01:16:44,000
Oh Christ!

1190
01:16:49,125 --> 01:16:51,375
Take that boat apart, you!

1191
01:16:51,458 --> 01:16:55,833
I want every one of those floorboards
back inside the house where they belong.

1192
01:16:55,916 --> 01:16:58,458
-Seriously?
-Yes, seriously.

1193
01:16:58,541 --> 01:17:02,041
You're ruining everything
I'm trying to fix!

1194
01:17:02,125 --> 01:17:04,250
It's… it's only a few floorboards.

1195
01:17:04,333 --> 01:17:06,041
It's a whole corridor.

1196
01:17:06,125 --> 01:17:08,125
How is anyone
supposed to access their rooms

1197
01:17:08,208 --> 01:17:10,625
if I don't have a corridor, Elias?

1198
01:17:10,708 --> 01:17:12,333
What are you even doing?

1199
01:17:12,416 --> 01:17:13,708
Wha… [sighs]

1200
01:17:15,208 --> 01:17:17,750
Cosmos said he'd help me leave.

1201
01:17:18,333 --> 01:17:20,041
Wh… what?

1202
01:17:20,625 --> 01:17:24,666
You… you're living here for free.
Why would you want to leave?

1203
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:26,375
Because everyone does.

1204
01:17:26,458 --> 01:17:28,625
By tomorrow,
the water will be in the house.

1205
01:17:28,708 --> 01:17:31,583
Oh, go then! Here, take them!

1206
01:17:31,666 --> 01:17:35,375
I'll… I'll rip up your room
and fix the corridor myself.

1207
01:17:35,458 --> 01:17:38,166
You can't stay here, Rosa.
Why can't you see it?

1208
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:41,833
[Rosa] I should've got rid of you
months ago. Paying with fish!

1209
01:17:41,916 --> 01:17:45,291
I'm going to get
better people than you and Jen

1210
01:17:45,375 --> 01:17:47,416
and finish this house myself!

1211
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:50,458
[sighs] Go on then! Leave!

1212
01:17:53,708 --> 01:17:55,708
[melancholy music playing]

1213
01:17:58,250 --> 01:17:59,541
[exhales]

1214
01:18:00,791 --> 01:18:02,791
[sniffling, whimpering]

1215
01:18:18,458 --> 01:18:20,041
[exhales deeply]

1216
01:18:20,125 --> 01:18:22,291
[muffled speaking outdoors]

1217
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,041
[indistinct chattering, chuckling]

1218
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:37,833
Uh…

1219
01:18:38,666 --> 01:18:40,291
Ugh.

1220
01:18:40,375 --> 01:18:41,208
[gasps]

1221
01:18:41,916 --> 01:18:42,750
[groans]

1222
01:18:44,416 --> 01:18:45,416
[exhales]

1223
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:48,458
Hmm.

1224
01:19:00,458 --> 01:19:01,416
[sighs]

1225
01:19:12,333 --> 01:19:15,000
[snoring softly]

1226
01:19:24,416 --> 01:19:25,416
Thank you.

1227
01:19:26,333 --> 01:19:27,208
Bye!

1228
01:19:31,250 --> 01:19:33,083
[didgeridoo blowing]

1229
01:19:34,458 --> 01:19:35,791
[murmuring]

1230
01:19:52,791 --> 01:19:55,625
[didgeridoo continues blowing]

1231
01:20:03,958 --> 01:20:05,875
Why didn't he say goodbye to me?

1232
01:20:06,541 --> 01:20:08,625
Didn't you say your goodbyes already?

1233
01:20:09,125 --> 01:20:10,541
No, not really.

1234
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,791
I didn't think he'd go.

1235
01:20:17,541 --> 01:20:20,541
He just needed a little guidance.
That's all.

1236
01:20:20,625 --> 01:20:22,583
[smacks lips, sighs]

1237
01:20:22,666 --> 01:20:25,041
There's nothing better out there anyway.

1238
01:20:25,125 --> 01:20:28,916
For those who decide not to find it,
there can be nothing.

1239
01:20:29,791 --> 01:20:32,083
If he dies, it's your fault, you know.

1240
01:20:32,166 --> 01:20:35,125
He wanted to leave a long time ago, Rosa.

1241
01:20:35,208 --> 01:20:37,041
Well, he never told me that.

1242
01:20:37,125 --> 01:20:39,208
He didn't want to hurt your feelings.

1243
01:20:39,291 --> 01:20:40,333
Oh, whatever!

1244
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,500
[exhales shakily]

1245
01:20:48,583 --> 01:20:50,833
He was never any use to me anyway.

1246
01:20:50,916 --> 01:20:52,083
Bloody fool.

1247
01:20:52,166 --> 01:20:53,333
[grunts]

1248
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:57,041
What the… What is that?

1249
01:20:57,125 --> 01:20:58,083
Oh, that.

1250
01:20:58,666 --> 01:21:02,708
Yes. I thought you might need it
once the mist has come and gone.

1251
01:21:02,791 --> 01:21:05,458
What? What are you talking about?

1252
01:21:06,125 --> 01:21:08,291
It's a lever. You can push it.

1253
01:21:08,375 --> 01:21:11,833
For your emancipation, Rosa,
should you choose it.

1254
01:21:11,916 --> 01:21:15,416
You just give it a bit of body weight,
and you'll be good to go.

1255
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:16,375
Ooh!

1256

Thank you for giving me
my first real home.

1264

Here are two presents.

1265

1271

Didn't you?

1272
01:22:32,666 --> 01:22:34,291
Do you want to have some lunch?

1273
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,416
One last time, before I go.

1274
01:22:38,916 --> 01:22:40,166
When are you leaving?

1275
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,083
We'll leave later, Cosmos said.

1276
01:22:45,291 --> 01:22:46,583
The morning, maybe.

1277
01:22:46,666 --> 01:22:48,083
I don't want to see him.

1278
01:22:48,166 --> 01:22:51,708
Just us then? Final meal together?

1279
01:22:51,791 --> 01:22:52,958
What do you think?

1280
01:22:55,666 --> 01:22:56,541

The water took the whole garden.

1286
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,375
Why don't you ever talk about the flood?

1287
01:23:48,416 --> 01:23:50,416
[Rosa] There's nothing to talk about.

1288
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:53,000
[Jen] I know you've been busy
with your project.

1289
01:23:53,583 --> 01:23:56,666
So you're just leaving with no plan.
Is that it?

1290
01:23:56,750 --> 01:23:57,666
That's right.

1291
01:23:57,750 --> 01:23:59,708
You'll never find a house like this again.

1292
01:23:59,791 --> 01:24:01,416
There'll be something else.

1293
01:24:02,541 --> 01:24:04,583
-It's time to move on.
-Where to?

1294

We don't know. We have to try.

1295

To make a home
with good memories for myself,

1299
01:24:21,125 --> 01:24:24,625
but I've been fighting this place
for bloody years.

1300
01:24:24,708 --> 01:24:27,333
Don't be frightened
about being someone else.

1301
01:24:27,416 --> 01:24:29,250
Oh, for God's sake.

1302

Try to see the good things
that you did make.

1303

Yeah, well, he doesn't know me.

1307

None of you do.

1308
01:24:44,875 --> 01:24:45,750
