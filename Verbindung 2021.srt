00:00:00,222 --> 00:00:02,177

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:10,200
There are still student fraternitys in Germany today.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Official YIFY movies site:
YTS.MX

5
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:15,550
They call themselves Landsmannschaften,
Burschenschaften, Turner and Corps

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,440
and their traditions go back for centuries.

7
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,640
Many of these student fraternities are still fencing.

8
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,910
It is a traditional rapier fight with sharpened weapons.

9
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,600
Fine, until someone bleeds.

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,050
My name is David von Scharrenberg, I'm a Corps Student,

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,370
and I'm about to go to my Mensur bout.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,420
Up please.

13
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:45,600
Ready.

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,350
Let's go!

15
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,750
Be a student when the fencing lashes fall

16
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:57,110
in a sharp duel that you chose yourself.

17
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:05,280
In bloody clashes the courage builds you up for life.

18
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:13,600
Be a student if your only worries, whether you will stand firm and brave:

19
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:22,400
In your life, daring morning, Lord, never let times go by!

20
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:32,310
In your life, daring morning, Lord, never let times go by!

21
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,160
Alright.

22
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,920
Here we are, with the blues.

23
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,560
This is the Corps House. Blue Corps. Blue Corps? Yes.

24
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,680
They don't always have the best reputation.
The correctness principle.

25
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:20,720
But that's also an important principle
to consider in a professional career.

26
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,360
Yes, beautiful isn't it?

27
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,440
Look here, correctness principle. Correctness principle? Yes.

28
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,960
Well, you can say gray, but blue, blue circle.

29
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,930
We don't really need that. With us the color is white.

30
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,200
That means?

31
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,800
Principle of nobility.

32
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,460
But still 150 euros per month.

33
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,330
That is correct. That is very correct.
And for that you can't do it yourself.

34
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,760
Right.

35
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,160
So I'm ringing the doorbell now.

36
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,730
We can't go back now.

37
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,800
What should I say?

38
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,570
Don’t worry you’ll be fine.

39
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:08,040
They have a shortage off new members.
Correctness principle is always short.

40
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,820
Corps Teutonia. Here we come!

41
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,620
Doktor von Scharrenberg.

42
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,820
I welcome you.

43
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,860
Michael Brandt, I think we spoke on the phone.

44
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,200
Yes, Mr. Brandt.

45
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,950
Nice that you are here. How was the drive?

46
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,450
Wonderful. Smooth, but a little long.

47
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,550
Yes that's true. And this?

48
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,500
And this is my son.

49
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,120
Yes, that is definitely our future Fox David.

50
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,040
Would you like something to drink, coffee, cola, beer?

51
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,020
With pleasure.

52
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,020
Beer?

53
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,370
For me a coke, beer is a little early.

54
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,110
Yes, of course, is also much more reasonable than beer.
Who drinks beer so early in the day?

55
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,620
I do.

56
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:02,470
So! Would you like to sit down, maybe?

57
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,470
Mrs. Hofmeister.

58
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,020
Could we have a beer and a coke please.

59
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:10,300
Yes, a beer, a cola and?

60
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,300
Some tea, Mrs. Hofmeister.

61
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,870
Many Thanks. Thank-you.

62
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,870
Cheers. Cheers my dear. Your health.

63
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,400
Please don't get me wrong.

64
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:29,120
We are of course pleased that your son
has expressed his interest in becoming a member.

65
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,300
But I must be wondering why your son isn't joining your Corps.

66
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,550
Vandalia. White circle. Principle of nobility.

67
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,550
It's a good covenant.

68
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,600
You could say so. We closed!

69
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,900
I did not knew that. That is very unfortunate.

70
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:49,100
Yes, that is unfortunate.

71
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,920
How did you find us?

72
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:58,300
Dr. von Scharrenberg told me on the phone that, after checking the Corps Lists,

73
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,020
he found that one of David's ancestors was a founding father of Teutonia.

74
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,670
A founding father. Can this be true?

75
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:09,650
That is. A founding father.

76
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,800
What an honour.

77
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,550
Are you still fencing?
You definitely don't fight anymore, do you?

78
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,020
Of course we are still fencing!

79
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,620
But it's not dangerous.

80
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,520
Ah, there are our active students.

81
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,750
Good Day gentlemen. Karl Jankwitz. First in charge .

82
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:39,370
Dr. von Scharrenberg, it's a pleasure to meet you.

83
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,050
And to meet you.

84
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,450
Kröger. Consenior. .

85
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:46,600
David right? Hello my dear one.

86
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,900
Heard a lot about you.

87
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,250
You want to study law. That is a very good decision.

88
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:57,100
Kröger, not Wiener, but Richert and I, we all study law.

89
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,770
We can certainly help you.

90
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,820
Do you already have a registration form?

91
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,620
No, we just got here.

92
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:06,950
No problem. We have already picked up one for you
and filled it out.

93
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,220
All you have to do is sign it.

94
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,770
Wiener.

95
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,470
Sign right there.

96
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,520
Exactly. Right there.

97
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:31,520
Good. I would say gentlemen… See you shortly in the Kneipe.

98
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,520
Meanwhile, enjoy your cold beer.

99
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,350
See you then.

100
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,870
Wiener, take this to our old member Mr. Westend.

101
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,250
Yes will be done.

102
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,250
Shouldn't I take this myself?

103
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,250
The dean is a Corps Brother.

104
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,250
By the way, I'm Sören.

105
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,670
David.

106
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,870
So you want to become a member, yes?

107
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,350
Well, let's see, my father was also a Corps Student.

108
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,300
Gentlemen. The inaugural Kneipe won't be prepared by itself.

109
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,000
Well, we are the guests.
We don't need to do anything.

110
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:36,100
So now listen carefully, friends of the Corps Student idea.

111
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,420
I am Bernd Geier, your Fox Major.

112
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,670
And therefore responsible for you.

113
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:45,400
And from now on, you do exactly what I tell you.

114
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,000
Alright, the Senior is about to begin the Kneipe
and welcome all off us.

115
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,350
Then we shall sing a traditional student song.

116
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,900
You will then be called to the front & accepted into the Corps in the traditional manner.

117
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,400
This is a very special moment in the life of a Corps Student.

118
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,950
You answer with yes, understood?

119
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,550
Then we all toast!

120
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,800
Cheers, Cheerio. Your health.

121
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,550
Silencium.

122
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,350
Silencium in the Fox Hutch!

123
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,150
Silencium!

124
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,150
I hereby open the inaugural Kneipe in the summer semester 2020...

125
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:32,500
...and rub a thundering Pint Salamander with everyone present.

126
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:40,250
Ad exercitium Salamadris,
1,2,3,1, Cheers.

127
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:48,450
2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3!

128
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:58,850
I am delighted that so many Corps Brothers
have come to this inaugural Kneipe.

129
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:09,200
And it is an extraordinary pleasure for me to welcome Doctor von Scharrenberg,
representative of the Corps Vandalia, to our House.

130
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,100
Then on our left, Mr. Metzel, representative of the Corps Alemania.

131
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,900
My good friend Gustav Eisenstein,
Senior of the Corps Suevia.

132
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:40,250
And last but not least, it is a special honor for me to welcome
our honorary member, elder gentlemen AHEM Pfander!

133
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,250
Bravo. Pfander!

134
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,950
I could swear I know him from television.

135
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,950
That's our interior minister.

136
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,950
Silencium, Mr. Scharrenberg.

137
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:59,250
Dear senior, on behalf of the elder gentlemen man, I thank you very much for the invitation

138
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:03,650
and I am delighted to be able to have a long sip with everyone present.

139
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,100
Cheers! Cheerio.

140
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:21,350
It is also a great pleasure for me to announce
that three future Foxes have taken their seats at our Fox table.

141
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:25,450
They all applied to join our Corps.

142
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:34,000
Mr. David von Scharrenberg, Mr. Hain
and the son of our elder Gentlemen Mr. Hubertus,
Mr. Wolfgang Hubertus.

143
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:38,650
I warmly welcome you all to our midst, and I wish you a boozy time.

144
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:46,800
Right. We sing the very first song; Thoughts are free
to be found in the Songbook on page 173.

145
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,000
The active ones start singing.

146
00:10:52,750 --> 00:11:01,400
Thoughts are free, who can guess them?

147
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:09,150
They fly by like nocturnal shadows.

148
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:17,050
No person can know them, no hunter can shoot them

149
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:27,250
and so it will always be: Thoughts are free!

150
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:35,350
Silencium.
We are now starting the ceremonial admission.

151
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:38,400
I now ask the three candidates to come forward.

152
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,400
Your appearance. Around the table once.

153
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:52,050
All of you have applied to join our Corps Teutonia.

154
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:56,350
I'll explain to you now what it means to be a Teuton.

155
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,050
The Corps Teutonia is a community of students from the university.

156
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:09,000
We maintain the traditions of the Corps
and also the academic fencing,
that connects young and old.

157
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:16,100
In the beginning you will be Foxes.
As a Fox you have to obey your older Corps Brothers.

158
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,650
We all live and study together on the Corps House.

159
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:29,700
After a trial period of two semesters
you will be accepted into the Corps after fencing the Mensur.

160
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:35,950
David von Scharrenberg, if you are willing to accept these rules,
then answer yes.

161
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,950
Yes.

162
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,750
Please free your sleeves.

163
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:49,300
Impressed by the atmosphere,
unable to realize the words or the meaning of the speech,

164
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,250
I just answered "yes".

165
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:56,800
I would never have uttered a "no" in this situation.

166
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:05,200
Which groom in front of the altar answers "No" when asked
whether he would like to spend his life with this woman?

167
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,650
That occurs only in movies.

168
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,900
Yes boys cheers. Drink.

169
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,850
Here drink, drink, drink.

170
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,250
I feel really sick.

171
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,250
I think I must puke.

172
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,250
But not here.

173
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,050
That will not do.

174
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,700
Wiener, show the fresh Fox our Pope!

175
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,950
Yes Sir, Fox Major.

176
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:42,950
I don't have to go to the Pope.
Yes, yes.
No, I'm evangelical.

177
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,950
Are you evangelical? Yes, I am a Protestant.

178
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:48,040
Hain you faggot, what's the matter with you?
Are you all right?

179
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:54,650
The Pope is a puke basin by us gentlemen.

180
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,550
Where we pope.

181
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:01,650
We bow to the Pope
and pay homage to the god of Porcelain.

182
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:09,350
Goethe is wrong.
Poping is derived from the Latin verb pabere, spit, spew, vomit.

183
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,100
I'm so sorry. I didn´t mean to...

184
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:17,400
Caution Wiener. Take care of your new Fox.

185
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:20,800
Otherwise you could lose him right away.

186
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,350
Everything under control, Mr. Metzel.

187
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:34,050
Come on. Come on Fox.

188
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:43,600
I just used the Pope for the first time.

189
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,300
Very good David, we drink to that.

190
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,300
We drink to that. Bottoms up!

191
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,000
Here.

192
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
What?

193
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,850
So that you have something to write next time.

194
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:21,600
So David, now that you are a Fox, you need a Mentor.

195
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,060
And at some point you need to decide if you would like me to become your Mentor.

196
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:31,200
We get along really well, don't we?

197
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,200
Yes, yes, great.

198
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,660
Richert, isn't it?

199
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,730
You know, I'm really happy about that ...

200
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:50,300
... that you put so much trust in me.

201
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,730
Then everything is clear.

202
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,750
Now you will be my Fox Student.

203
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,500
You know, I don't know the other corps brothers very well yet.

204
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:10,600
And then I thought that I, well,

205
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,900
So I actually wanted to get to know the others before I decide.

206
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,400
I need a little more time.

207
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:28,500
But it's really nice with you, to make that decision.

208
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:38,000
Can we do this after breakfast with the other brothers? I'm not fully awake yet.

209
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,170
As you wish, Fox Scharrenberg.

210
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:48,900
I didn't want to put you under pressure.
Take your time.

211
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,100
Scharrenberg.

212
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,400
Fencing, fencing, fencing!

213
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:02,200
Men get up. Fox Hubertus. Krause. Wake up!

214
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,000
Late comers, do push-ups.

215
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,600
Fencing hour. Get up.

216
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,200
Get up. Hey, wake up!

217
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,600
Inactive Corps Brother Brandt…

218
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,600
Yes sir.

219
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,750
Get me a Beer Boy.
Accepted.

220
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,750
Fill up.
With pleasure.

221
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,170
What are you doing there?

222
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,170
We are drinking our first Beer Boy of the day.

223
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,420
Beer Boy?

224
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,420
Accepted.

225
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:25,730
Here.

226
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,200
No thanks, but...

227
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,260
Honestly now what is a Beer Boy?

228
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,710
Beer Boy is both an invitation and the generic term
for an academic beer duel.

229
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,660
You call the other fraternity student to quickly down a beer.

230
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:43,060
To win, you need to finish the beer faster
and put the glass down first.

231
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,750
Cheers you whore. Drink!

232
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,080
Finished.

233
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,640
Obviously a draw.

234
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:04,000
No, come on, thank you, I think it's too early to drink, right?

235
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,020
I mean, I'm still totally hungover from yesterday.

236
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,020
Just leave it be.

237
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:14,310
Fox, when you said Beer Boy you officially challenged me.

238
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,750
And I accepted.

239
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,200
So I would say the mugs are filled up according to the rules.

240
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:24,480
All preluminaries are thus fulfilled.

241
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,480
Do you see it differently?

242
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,930
Do you need a referee?

243
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,420
Now become truthful and drink like a man.

244
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,420
Or are you not capable of giving satisfaction.

245
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,420
Satis...what?

246
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,420
Genugtuung is Latin for satisfaction.

247
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,060
It's about honour.

248
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,750
We Corps Students keep our word.

249
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,260
You want to be a Corps Student, right?

250
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,260
Then you have to stand by our principles.

251
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,640
The first command counts.

252
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,640
From the floor.

253
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,640
To the testicles.

254
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,640
From the floor to the testicles.

255
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,060
To the belly button.

256
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,400
To the trap.

257
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
Say cheers in the middle.

258
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,400
Cheers. Drink!

259
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,200
Finished.

260
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,200
Hey, hey.

261
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:17,020
Look at that. The Fox is capable.

262
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:19,150
He is quick with the Beer Boy.

263
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,970
You looked pretty old here mate.

264
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:21,910
Accepted.

265
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,750
Double.

266
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,000
Say Jankwitz. You have such awesome porn.

267
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Give me one.

268
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,640
Fuck off.

269
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,640
Wiener. Get lost.

270
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,840
Get the fuck out off from my room.
Come on everyone out!

271
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,840
Disgusting, filthy dirt pack.

272
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,840
Hey Wiener, leave that shit.

273
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,550
Hello.

274
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,550
Folks, what´s going on?

275
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,330
Fencing is the order of the day.

276
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,710
Nope.

277
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,080
Are we a fencing fraternity here or what?

278
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,530
My dear Mr. Choral Society.

279
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,860
Ah, Brandt.

280
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,710
Did you wake up in the yellow circle again today?

281
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,350
Senior take a look at our Secretary.

282
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,880
She takes care of things that are none of her business.

283
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,280
Better take care of the Corps Treasury.

284
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:14,080
I was downstairs earlier and looked at the Corps Bill.

285
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,660
I would say pretty sloppy cash management.

286
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:19,860
It’s not my fault. What am I supposed to do if they don't pay?

287
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,860
Well, then you have to issue fines.

288
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:27,680
2 Euro, 5 Euro, 20 Euro. Man Richert, that's your job!

289
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,370
You want the Corps to be run tight, don't you?

290
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,370
So now listen up.

291
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:38,350
You are aware that our Corps account devours
18% overdraft interest when it is in the red.

292
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,350
I'll make an announcement now.

293
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:45,510
If the account is still in the red by the next Covent
I'll file a complaint!

294
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,480
What kind of mess is this here?

295
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,060
Hey! In 5 minutes there will be fencing practice.

296
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,400
What is this crap?

297
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:59,020
And what is this?

298
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:04,970
Well well Wiener, I always knew that you were a piglet, but this?

299
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,970
I need this now.

300
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,600
You will you get it back after fencing, when I'm done.

301
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,530
Forget it. I am freed from fencing for the whole semester.

302
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,240
Broke my wrist last semester.

303
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:19,280
No more fencing for me, okay?

304
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:22,570
Got a medical certificate from our old man, Meier the fourth.

305
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,570
Yes. True.

306
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:26,080
But good enough to beat the meat?

307
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,640
Granted.

308
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:34,260
So, now a nice hangover breakfast, okay?

309
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,240
Fox, where is your ribbon?

310
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,800
In my room.

311
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,370
Very wrong answer Fox Krause.

312
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:43,370
The ribbon is always on the man.

313
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,530
Uh, yeah, sorry, my apologies.

314
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,310
I did not know. I'll put it on right away.

315
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,310
Ah, it's not that easy.

316
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,150
Not until you extricate.

317
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,240
Oh Richert, Do I have to do it now?

318
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,680
Are you getting impudent with me Fox?

319
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,260
You drink that up now.

320
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,020
Come on. Extricate. Quickly!

321
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:19,420
Well, it works. Fox Krause.

322
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,460
Hopefully this will teach you a lesson.

323
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,440
Never leave your ribbon unguarded.

324
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,240
And now sing our color verse.

325
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,040
Teutonia I belong to you.

326
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,530
I swear by your colors.

327
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,020
On the red and gray ribbon.

328
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:43,240
Well well Fox Krausse. Maybe something will become of you after all.

329
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,110
Warm up men.

330
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,000
Geier, where is your guard?

331
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Your quart has been better too.

332
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,330
Beer Boy.

333
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:56,040
Double.

334
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,640
Quadruple.

335
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,770
Fox Scharrenberg.

336
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:02,800
What are you doing?

337
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,640
When I say the lesson begins at 8 o'clock Cum Tempore.

338
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,220
Then it begins on time and not a second later.

339
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,220
Someone doesn’t know any Latin.

340
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,680
Waldorf student what?

341
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:12,660
But I had to.

342
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:14,400
You want to argue with me?

343
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,400
Go down. 10 pushups at once.

344
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,640
Get down Fox.

345
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,480
Get down.

346
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:26,000
Scharrenberg, it will never work like that.

347
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,840
And again we have to wait for you.

348
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,110
Come on, that's enough.

349
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,710
Up with you.

350
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:46,400
So men. This is the Basket blade.

351
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,400
The weapon of the Corps Students.

352
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,460
The Training Blade is 120 centimeters long.

353
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,460
And of course dull.

354
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,200
So you can't hurt yourself with it. Not yet!

355
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,730
The Mensur Blade, however. Razor sharp.

356
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:06,530
The front sharpened 35 centimeters.

357
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:09,680
And the back is sharpened 25 centimeters.

358
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,310
And the fencing gauntlet of course.

359
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,710
Scharrenberg. Repeat.

360
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,880
Yeah, um...

361
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,880
Yes! You have to listen.

362
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,860
Richert!

363
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,350
Geier, show us the target areas.

364
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,460
So guys.

365
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,220
We have three target areas.

366
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:30,170
Once prime.

367
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,110
Quart.

368
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,110
And the Terz.

369
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,530
OK?

370
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:39,600
All right? Come on men.

371
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:50,080
Centered. In the middle? Exactly in the center.

372
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:55,730
What's going on here? Fox. Arm up.

373
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,020
Too much of drinking yesterday?

374
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:00,480
Nice.

375
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:05,420
You are supposed to swing Fox Krause. No falderal.

376
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:12,530
And down. It doesn't work. Down. It's not working.

377
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,970
How's it going?

378
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:17,860
Well, he is doing well. Yes.

379
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:23,460
Krause. Get your arm up, proper up.
Feet position. Yes, this is better.

380
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:31,110
Up there, and then you turn off,
pull past you on the left. Here where I am now.

381
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:38,840
Swinging! Fox Krause! - Right past you, pull up and turn your wrist.

382
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,840
And then back here.

383
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:44,000
So Men. Sparring!

384
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,750
Richert. Bring me my fencing stuff.

385
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,060
Alright Buddy.

386
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,460
Distance yourself.

387
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,440
Pull backwards. Hold it with your left hand.

388
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:07,200
Height adjustment..

389
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:08,710
Down.

390
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,710
Come here. That’s enough.

391
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,530
Up.

392
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,660
Ready.

393
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,220
Go.

394
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,200
Your guard.

395
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:26,440
Relax.

396
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,710
Again.

397
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:32,970
Kröger.

398
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:36,220
Set. Go.

399
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,330
Yes.

400
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,330
Halt!

401
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,260
Go.

402
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,660
A bit faster Fox. Man.

403
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,730
Halt! That's enough.

404
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,170
Richert. Come here.

405
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:03,110
Well done buddy.

406
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:06,000
Now all stand in a circle.

407
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,510
So guys. You don't know about the chairs yet, do you?

408
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:12,480
Pick up chairs. The chair always stays above your head.

409
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,480
Did I say form a semicircle?

410
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,840
Hello !!!Scharre.!!! Yes. Please!

411
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:20,570
So now. Where is the circle?

412
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,570
Make a real circle. And now pass it on.

413
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,420
Look sharp Jankwitz. Where's the next chair?

414
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,420
Kröger you slow-poke. Yes sir.

415
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:32,570
Next. Yes, nice. And so on. Tempo. Now people. Keep it up.

416
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:36,880
Here we go. Nicely high. Okay Please. Onward. Next chair. That's how it has to work!

417
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,110
Tempo, Tempo. Exactly. Faster. Good.
Keep your shoulders and arms up.

418
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:45,770
Teutonia I belong to you.

419
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:50,130
I swear by your colors.

420
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:54,710
On the red-gray ribbon.

421
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:58,660
And pee against the wall.

422
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,950
That´s right Wiener.

423
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:10,970
Hey David, have you settled in well?

424
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:12,480
Hello!

425
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,420
Really great. It's a lot of fun with you here in the Corps.

426
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,420
Thanks Wiener.

427
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,400
What worries me a little is the university.

428
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:27,020
I haven't done anything for that yet.

429
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,020
Oh nonsense. Now is just the introductory week.
It really doesn't start until tomorrow.

430
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:40,080
We can go to the seminar together tomorrow.
Then I'll show you everything. Agreed?

431
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,150
That would be cool.

432
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,000
Yesterday Richert asked me if I would like to be his Mentor.

433
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,660
Really?

434
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,620
I refused.

435
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,930
I think he's really mad at me now.

436
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,040
Don't worry about it.

437
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,040
Take your time.

438
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,040
That’s your choice.

439
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,460
Such a relationship needs to be chosen well.

440
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,260
Well, it really took me a while
to figure out that I want Brandt as my ...

441
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:15,110
Swine... Mentor.

442
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:18,440
And I haven't regretted it until now.

443
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:26,660
How do I actually do it when have decided for a Mentor.

444
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,910
You have to drink.

445
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,800
You get two beers, go to the one and just ask.

446
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,550
Nobody will refuse. You do not do that.

447
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:39,110
Especially not with a smashing Fox like you are.

448
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:41,640
Very well then.

449
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,800
Jankwitz.

450
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:51,550
I would be very happy if you became my Mentor.

451
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,820
I'm really pleased old sport. Cheers.

452
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:59,060
Cheers student. Bottoms up! Drink.

453
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,930
Brandt.

454
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:06,220
Yes.

455
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,350
Would you be my Mentor?

456
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,350
Of course. Come here.

457
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,600
Turn around nicely. Turn around.

458
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:40,570
Here we have the sugar.

459
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:42,080
Thank you very much, Ms. Hoffmeister.

460
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,200
You are welcome.

461
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,460
That looks really good. Thanks.

462
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,280
Thank you Ms. Hoffmeister. Tastes glorious.

463
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,280
Yes fine. Brutus.

464
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:58,570
Nice sausage for breakfast.
That's the way it should be for a Corps Dog of your class.

465
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,550
Fox Student.

466
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:03,550
We saw you. Come here.

467
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,550
Where do you want to go?

468
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:09,370
I still have to go to university.
I have an important introductory lecture today.

469
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,730
I definitely don't want to miss it.

470
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:13,550
Give me something from the hooker shower.

471
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,550
Yes, and what about breakfast?

472
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,110
I wanted to have breakfast in the cafeteria.

473
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,110
Nonsense Fox.

474
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:23,150
You have breakfast here on the house with your Corps Brothers.
Nothing better can happen to you.

475
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:27,730
Then we will go for a wonderful walk with Brutus
and saunter through the spring.

476
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:29,730
Sit down Fellow Fox and eat.

477
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,000
You still have to get big and strong.

478
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:39,150
Yes, fine Brutus. Yes fine.

479
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,220
Yes Brutus.

480
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:45,420
Are we going out later?

481
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,000
Feed him.

482
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:54,040
5 euros in the piggy bank immediately.

483
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:58,480
Ten. Then I have another one free.

484
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,280
Wiener.

485
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,800
Do you want coffee? With pleasure.

486
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:12,750
From now on there was breakfast every day
or any other reason not to leave the house.

487
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,880
The university was becoming more and more distant.

488
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,880
But that didn't bother me much.

489
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,620
The Corps had an incredible pull on me.

490
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,620
Cheers to the middle is welcome. Extremely welcome.

491
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,280
Like a kind of maelstrom.

492
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,280
We ran a House.

493
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,800
A big House.

494
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,800
And that took up the whole man.

495
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,800
There was always something to do.

496
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,840
Going to university was frowned upon.

497
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,110
- Cold Iron.

498
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,600
Fox Education.

499
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:52,970
So what's that?
Do I see a TV in the house?

500
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,820
Hurray, we're becoming stupid.

501
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,370
That is absolutely unnecessary!

502
00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:01,640
Turn it off immediately. The TV must go as soon as possible.

503
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:06,220
Wiener, you’re responsible for it.

504
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:11,770
Or you are taking off to...

505
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,530
To where?

506
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,970
Wiener, seriously now.

507
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:23,770
We are not an association here to which one can sue for membership.

508
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,600
This way you'll always stay a Silver Fox.

509
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,110
Hey, where's the remote?

510
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:31,770
Okay.

511
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:33,370
Fox Major.

512
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:34,970
Yes.

513
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:40,400
Can I be given leave of absence from the Fox Lesson?
I still have to study. I've an exam tomorrow.

514
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,930
Yeah, but now it's Fox Education.

515
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,480
You can study later.

516
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,600
So, now, finally.

517
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,950
I hereby open your second Fox Lesson.

518
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,770
Fill up your glasses, yes.

519
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,770
Beer again?

520
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:03,770
I still feel rotten from yesterday.

521
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:05,240
I'll have a coke.

522
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,240
Can I also drink non-alcoholic?

523
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,240
I have the important exam tomorrow.

524
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,240
I'm reporting beer sick.

525
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,370
You are Foxes.

526
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:16,970
You’re at the beginning of your studies. You can still afford that.

527
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:20,710
See, I finished my studies years ago.

528
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:25,020
Actually, I’ve been an old gentleman for a long time
and need to take care of my doctor’s office.

529
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:28,170
I'm drinking because of you guys.

530
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,260
I became active again because of you.

531
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:35,600
Now don't act like that. No shit.

532
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:41,510
You are Corps Students… You have to take a little hardship.

533
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:43,110
But actually.

534
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:45,770
But what, but what? There is no discussion here, Fox.

535
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:49,330
Hey, we all want to have some fun here, right?

536
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:51,330
Yes, well then!

537
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:53,770
Now you fill up the cups.

538
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:57,060
Hello Hubertus, are you going to fill your cup.

539
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,420
Exactly. Good Fox.

540
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:04,260
Don't worry. We don't want to get totally drunk here or anything. Right?

541
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,620
Just a small, cozy beer.

542
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,880
Ok, so cheers.

543
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,400
Cheers.

544
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:13,370
Cheers to you two.

545
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:20,750
So. First part done. Bugger me!

546
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,750
David. What is it like?

547
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:26,400
The colors of the fraternity houses?
From the Corp Houses. Tell me.

548
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,200
Teutonia.

549
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,200
Red grey.

550
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:36,880
Well. Super. Yes come on.

551
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:39,370
Colours?

552
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,370
This is taking too long for me now.

553
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:46,400
Hubertus. What about the circles?
What kind of circles do we have? Blue circle.

554
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,400
For example. Well start with the black circle.

555
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:52,260
The principle of fencing and the principle of thrift.

556
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,800
Good yes. Next circle. Blue circle.

557
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:59,420
Social Principle and Correctness Principle.
Correct.

558
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,440
Okay. Next would be the green circle.

559
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,660
Shabbiness principle and tolerance principle.

560
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:12,310
Well then we still have the white circle.
This is actually unimportant. But for the sake of completeness.

561
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:14,310
Principle of nobility.

562
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,170
Principle of nobility. Okay?

563
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:19,280
Super. Wonderful.
Do you now know the colors of Suevia? David.

564
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,220
Green.

565
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,420
OK. Well, we have Corps relationships too.

566
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:28,840
Wiener. You tell me. Who is our befriended Corps?

567
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,820
The Corps Suevia. These are the Swabians.

568
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,150
Yes and what kind of circle?

569
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,570
That's the green circle.

570
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:37,680
Krause?

571
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,680
No, it is circle-free.

572
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:45,420
Circle-free, exactly. And today we have an away game, a visit to the Suevia.

573
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,130
Look alive. We’re dressing up and paying them a visit.

574
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:49,550
Here we go.

575
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:51,550
Cheers. Cheers.

576
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,240
Open up. Home visit.

577
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,240
Open.

578
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,260
Open the door.

579
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,600
Jankwitz. Corps Teutonia. We are stopping by for a beer.

580
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,770
Huh? I have to ask the Senior first...

581
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:11,510
Ah, booze frats, booze.

582
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:20,350
Oh no you again. That is boring.

583
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:22,350
You have nothing better in mind.

584
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:23,550
That is very poor.

585
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:25,550
Fill up, you whore.

586
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:27,550
Your sayings were better.

587
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:30,840
Fags in the house. Home visit. Home visit.

588
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,840
Foxes. Come here.

589
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,530
You... You!

590
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,530
Gustav.

591
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:42,400
Man Foxes you have 5 seconds to come here!

592
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,710
Get some liquid. Fill up.

593
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:50,220
Faster you bastards.

594
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:58,620
Fill up. Finally fill up the cups.

595
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:01,110
Well Eisenstein. Shit isn´t it?

596
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:04,220
How are you doing?

597
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,220
As always, better than you!

598
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:08,440
Where did you find those four failures?

599
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,620
In the same brothel your mother works in.

600
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:12,620
Tell a story.

601
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:15,200
Shut up. Drink!

602
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,110
Hey! They're for the boat race.

603
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:20,840
Strengthen yourself dumb Fox and then fill up the cups.

604
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,040
Fill up you dumb Fox.

605
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,440
Yeah, fill up, you dumb Fox.

606
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,840
Shut up Scharri. Fox cigarette lighter.

607
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:33,820
Well Foxes, they're like that. Drink.

608
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:38,170
You are pretty overconfident, so can you do with the cup?

609
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,660
We'll see that in a moment, colleague.

610
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,770
What's your name?

611
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:45,420
Kirchow.

612
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:47,640
Ah, an East German beast.

613
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:49,640
Let me guess.

614
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,480
Your name is, ah, Mike?

615
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:54,480
Ronny.

616
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,350
Or Rene?

617
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:57,550
Enrico.

618
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:03,240
Enri, Enrico, on the fourth guess a hit.

619
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:07,240
Hey! You are drinking right now.

620
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:09,600
Come on. Drink!

621
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:12,220
Drink up, you son of an Eastern hooker!

622
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:16,350
Kröger no more mother insults.
For this we must both drink a pitcher.

623
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:20,260
Gladly, but not before I am finished with your East Fox here.

624
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,880
Silencium.

625
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:26,970
Shut up, you bastards!

626
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:32,170
Well, it's a tragedy that the Teutons
get lost in our House every now and then.

627
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:34,480
How often should we flush you out?

628
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,480
You never learn anything?

629
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:40,530
Hey, I'll give you a gastric lavage in a moment.

630
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:42,530
Silencium.

631
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:44,530
Wiener, I'll come to you.

632
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:50,040
So now we're drinking todays debut boat race as an overture.

633
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,040
Cheers.

634
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:55,550
Do you know what that means, you uneducated assholes?

635
00:39:56,570 --> 00:40:00,970
Since you were here yesterday, you know the preluminaries.
Let's begin right away.

636
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:03,110
The right side counts.

637
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,620
Affirmative. One.

638
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,280
Two.

639
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,130
Three.

640
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:07,640
Four.

641
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,310
Five.

642
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:09,280
Six.

643
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,820
Seven. Eight. Nine.

644
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:14,170
Ten. Teutonia comes to ten.

645
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:16,170
So, Suevia counts through.

646
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:18,170
One two Three.

647
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:20,170
Four. Five.

648
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:22,170
Six, seven.

649
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,730
We drink twice.

650
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:29,330
Decent. Then Suevia has fourteen.

651
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:30,750
You will have to catch up.

652
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,040
Gladly.

653
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:36,310
The four new Foxes each drink twice.

654
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:38,620
One. Two.

655
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,460
Two.

656
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,750
Four you pig.

657
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:41,950
Four.

658
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:43,950
Six.

659
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,330
Seven. Eight.

660
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:46,440
Ten.

661
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,510
Eleven.

662
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,770
No, Hain, you have to say twelve.

663
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:52,970
I cannot. I can not do it.

664
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:57,600
Teutonia no longer drinks. Teutonia no longer drinks.

665
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:01,910
Quiet. Silencium.

666
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,800
Don't chat. Count.

667
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,080
I take over.

668
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,640
Thirteen.

669
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,910
Fourteen. Teutonia has fourteen.

670
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:11,910
Teutonia also comes up with fourteen.

671
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:15,910
Jankwitz was your side showing signs of weakness? Incredible.

672
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:17,910
So, let's go.

673
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:20,350
Cheers my favorite frat.

674
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,080
Gulp.

675
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,080
Gulp. Faster.

676
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,710
Come on Scharrenberg.

677
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:04,800
Geier, Geier.

678
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,800
Brandt.

679
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:08,800
Down it.

680
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,800
Here we go.

681
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:36,930
Silencium. That was a classic draw.

682
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:40,310
A draw, are you crazy?

683
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:43,150
Look at your boys, they spilled half of the brew.

684
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,600
They bleed.

685
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,600
Silencium.

686
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,400
Jankwitz that also applies to you and to you Brandt.

687
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:59,020
This boat race is suspended for five beer minutes
until both parties have adequately refilled.

688
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:01,020
Silencium Ex.

689
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:03,240
Drink.

690
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:08,350
Do you see that looser?

691
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:11,200
Totally cut up.

692
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:15,770
Never let your guard down.

693
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:17,770
Then it works with women too.

694
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:21,510
Geier. Talking about fencing is bad style.

695
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:23,510
I've told you that a thousand times.

696
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:29,330
What kind of hooker price do I get with a face like that?

697
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,860
You fucking Foxes!

698
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:36,880
Just 3-days here and already big mouthing?!

699
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:40,800
Wait until you have to fence yourself.
Then you shit your pants.

700
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:44,220
Take that back.

701
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:46,620
Why should I?

702
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:50,400
Did you just call me a stupid boy?

703
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:53,330
It will be like that.

704
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,660
Herr Geier. I ask for satisfaction.

705
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,550
With pleasure.

706
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:07,060
I look forward to settle this matter with you
as a personal contract.

707
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:11,200
See you at the next ordinary determination day!

708
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,620
Beer Boy.

709
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:13,770
Double.

710
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:15,370
Quadruple.

711
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:16,310
Accepted.

712
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:19,020
Fill up Fox.

713
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,400
Yes, the Swabian has challenged Geier to a personal Contract.

714
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:28,040
That means he challenged him to a duel, so to speak.

715
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:30,440
We also call this an honorary quarrel.

716
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:37,200
And one who, yes, who is as appropriate as Geier of course accepts it.

717
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:39,510
For us, this is part of the comment.

718
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,620
Good manners.

719
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:43,510
So a personal contract...

720
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:46,350
...is an aggravated form of academic fencing.

721
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,840
45 rounds instead of 30. Six strikes instead of 5.

722
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:52,840
No breaks.

723
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,930
Oh shit.

724
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:59,280
Do not worry. Geier used to be a fencer ace, the best fencer in town.

725
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,970
In his active time, he slashed everybody.

726
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:08,130
I don't understand.

727
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:12,130
Why do they want to duel because of such a trivial little thing?

728
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:16,000
Well, it's about the principle. Honour. Satisfaction.

729
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:21,910
So you take care of who you talk to.

730
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,660
You can also get challenged, yes!

731
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:25,910
Eightfold.

732
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,220
Gottlob, can you still drink?

733
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,170
Eightfold. Sixteen times.

734
00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:34,170
Thirty-two times.

735
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:36,170
Sixty-four times.

736
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:36,970
Accepted.

737
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:38,170
Drink you whore.

738
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:40,170
Just a moment. Fill up.

739
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:42,170
Fill up you...

740
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:47,330
Such visits and return visits were typical.
It happened all the time.

741
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:52,080
In our town there were 5 Corps and dozens of other fraternities.

742
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:55,910
Why did you steal the flag?
Are you going to wipe your ass with this?

743
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:02,040
Exactly, that is color disgrace, you don't do it like that.

744
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,280
Official Assignment.

745
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,420
Quiet the contrary Krause. We have a long tradition of stealing flags.

746
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:13,510
Listen, the Swabians have to come here now and recapture their flag.

747
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:18,170
It would only have been Color disgrace if we had destroyed the flag.

748
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:20,170
Recapture?

749
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:24,660
Everything we put on the flag they have to drink up.

750
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:28,750
And and we swear on them and we scream at them.

751
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:33,240
That's stupid.

752
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:39,110
I'm going to bed, I'm totally exhausted.

753
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:40,480
Weak Fox. Slow-poke.

754
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,480
Me too. Good night lads.

755
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:44,480
Dry shite.

756
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,130
Ditto. Wet dreams Corps Brothers.

757
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:50,930
Departure.

758
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,000
Wait and see, they don't even need to take off their clothes.

759
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,130
How come?

760
00:46:56,660 --> 00:47:01,150
Well, because the Swabians will quickly notice that we have their flag.

761
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:03,860
And then they will come over.

762
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,680
Section 11 of the German Beer Comment.

763
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:09,910
Keep on drinking.

764
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:29,110
Someone came to visit almost every day.

765
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:32,170
And if they were too lazy to come over.

766
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:36,220
Then they got on the blower or demanded a videocall.

767
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:38,840
A marathon that never seemed to end.

768
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:40,800
Hey.

769
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,820
Wiener, he won't wake up.

770
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:46,880
We'll have to play the Russian game there.

771
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,730
Yes, it's okay. Please don't speak so loudly. My head is throbbing.

772
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
What are you going to do now?

773
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:57,420
Take a good look Scharrenberg. We're playing the Russian game now.

774
00:47:58,130 --> 00:48:05,550
We're now playing the Russian game, the Russian game, the Russian game.

775
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:09,330
We're playing the Russian game now.

776
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:11,330
Russian game.

777
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:14,840
And who doesn't want to drink.

778
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:19,280
Who doesn´t want to drink, will get wet!

779
00:48:19,370 --> 00:48:20,170
Wake up!

780
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:22,170
Russian game.

781
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,570
Hey, Fox Hubertus, get up. Come on!

782
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:26,570
Drink. Finally drink.

783
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,970
Up with you and finally drink Hubertus.

784
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:30,970
I have to sleep.

785
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,000
Sleep?

786
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,130
You get up now and drink or...

787
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:38,570
Stop it, he's totally exhausted, come on.

788
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:42,620
What? Shut up Fox! Go to the fencing hall and warm up.

789
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:45,640
Come on Hubertus. Just a beer or get up.

790
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,640
Drink now or...

791
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:49,640
Fuck.

792
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,640
Are you nuts?

793
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:54,930
Do you also want to rebel Fox?

794
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:59,020
Come on. We have fencing practice now.

795
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:02,130
Go to the fencing hall. Immediately!

796
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,770
Wiener. Come on. We have to go now.

797
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:26,310
I want to sleep through for twelve hours now - Without interruption.

798
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,310
At least.

799
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:33,460
Forget it Krause. Our drill instructor was just here.
Changed the schedule.

800
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:35,730
Morning exercise is the order of the day.

801
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:38,480
So Foxes. Listen carefully.

802
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:43,060
Fencing Master Metzel is coming today.
You can really learn something from him.

803
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:47,770
He has been training all of the fraternities in the area for 30 years.

804
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:51,420
So, a little respect.

805
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:53,820
I hate morning exercises.

806
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:57,150
Come on men. The early bird catches the worm.

807
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:59,770
Except Wiener, he only has bad breath.

808
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:01,770
Good morning, Gentlemen.

809
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:04,840
Man, already so hardworking.

810
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:08,530
Who is the Consenior here this semester?

811
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,530
That would be me, Master.

812
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:16,350
Man Kröger it is the possibility. Hilarious.

813
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,350
Well then, let's go.

814
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,530
All of you sit down.

815
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:37,060
Up. Ready.

816
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:38,570
Go.

817
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:43,950
Jeez!

818
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,570
Kröger.

819
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:52,800
That is a completely pointless what you are fabricating.

820
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:57,280
A little more technique. More elegance.

821
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,530
If I may ask.

822
00:50:58,880 --> 00:50:59,820
Sorry Master.

823
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:01,680
Or do you want to cut off my arm?

824
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,840
Geier. You come up.

825
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:08,260
Show me how to waggle properly.

826
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,110
Go.

827
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,950
Stop. Man!

828
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,280
Geier. What's wrong with you?

829
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:22,800
No stamina?

830
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:25,860
Don't you have an appointment for a personal contract?

831
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:30,750
Even a fencer ace has to prep orderly otherwise it won't work.

832
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:36,170
Don't worry Master. I'll be back in top form in no time time.

833
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:38,170
You're totally drunk.

834
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,330
Sit down.

835
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:41,460
Oh boy!

836
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:50,350
Hubertus, Hubertus.

837
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:01,370
Very good. You will become a good fencer.

838
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:03,370
What's your name?

839
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,640
Wolfgang Hubertus.

840
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:08,000
The son of Jens Hubertus.

841
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,510
No wonder.

842
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:13,510
Thanks. Next.

843
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,350
Come over.

844
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:21,770
Quick.

845
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:24,800
I'm starting.

846
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:27,770
Ready. Go.

847
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:37,150
Fox. So what is that?

848
00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:41,680
So if you go on Mensur like this
then there will be shredded food later.

849
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,680
Over. Done. End.

850
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:45,200
Sit down.

851
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:49,150
You are all totally done. Unacceptable.

852
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:56,130
Now listen up. Kröger, the next time I come,
you'll be sober. All off you!

853
00:52:58,310 --> 00:53:00,440
Wiener bring me an apple spritzer.

854
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,910
Yes Master.

855
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:10,660
Do you already know the joke about the two gays who go canoeing?

856
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:18,170
I have another one.

857
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,170
Don't give up so easily.

858
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,310
I thought you'd like it here, with us in the Corps.

859
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:29,510
You are a son off a member. What should your father think?

860
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:31,510
Man, you are so naive.

861
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:33,860
You don't understand anything at all.

862
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:37,240
I don't want to jeopardize my studies.

863
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:40,260
I want to study biology and not binge drink every day.

864
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:41,770
You can still study.

865
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:45,600
I'm tired of being commanded by these idiots all the time.

866
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:47,370
It's not that bad.

867
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,350
It would be a shame to lose you as a Corps Brother.

868
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:54,350
You'd better not lose yourself.

869
00:53:59,330 --> 00:54:00,260
All the best David.

870
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,420
Take care of yourself.

871
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,020
Don't be like them.

872
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:26,080
Master Metzel is over there.
What is he doing there?

873
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:31,770
On such fencing days, Metzel is always there.
He trained the Germanis in the low fencing style.

874
00:55:33,555 --> 00:55:34,755
Low fencing?

875
00:55:34,888 --> 00:55:38,000
This is the fencing style the two fraternities have agreed on.

876
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:40,711
A more dangerous version of the Mensur.

877
00:55:43,150 --> 00:55:48,220
Watch carefully Scharrenberg.
We wanted to show you this so that you know what to expect.

878
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:50,220
Silencium in the fencing room.

879
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,440
I would like to ask you to close all doors and windows.

880
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:57,150
As well as quitting smoking and eating.

881
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:07,600
I would like to point out again that filming and photographing
is strictly forbidden during Mensur bout.

882
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:11,640
The second gentlemen have the floor.

883
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,860
Thank you high impartial.

884
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:18,260
I am hereby anouncing a tripartite Pro Patria.

885
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:23,550
Between my dear fraternity Germania
and a respectable fraternity Austria.

886
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:26,260
The rules of the low fencing style apply.

887
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,860
I am anouncing the first match of the Pro Patria.

888
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:34,710
Mr Meier, representative of the Germania fraternity, is fighting at my side.

889
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:40,530
This Mensur bout goes over 40 rounds of 5 strikes
including the first strike.

890
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:44,350
There is no blow of honour. I have nothing more to announce.

891
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:49,280
My brother Moeller is fencing on my side.

892
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:57,110
I still have a medically prescribed leather Scar-protection to report.

893
00:56:57,110 --> 00:57:03,110
The long opening command is on my side. The final command with the others.

894
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,840
Thanks. Silencium for such a Mensur bout.

895
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:30,530
Finally we start.

896
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:33,950
Stance.

897
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,880
Ready.

898
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:41,730
Hit yourselves.

899
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:45,910
Halt!

900
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:53,600
Up please.

901
00:57:58,310 --> 00:57:59,510
Ready.

902
00:58:00,711 --> 00:58:01,911
Hit yourselves.

903
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:07,020
Halt.

904
00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:11,820
Physician.

905
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:19,150
Continue.

906
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:23,730
Germania reports a small bloody hit at quart.

907
00:58:24,350 --> 00:58:26,310
In position for the third round.

908
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:33,370
Ready.

909
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:35,600
Hit yourselves.

910
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,400
Continuation.

911
00:58:58,530 --> 00:59:02,222
Oh God. Why don't the Austrians give up?
He's badly injured.

912
00:59:02,355 --> 00:59:05,680
Yes, the frats let stand longer.
They don't give up as quickly as we do.

913
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,800
Hit yourselves.

914
00:59:10,530 --> 00:59:11,730
Halt.

915
00:59:16,310 --> 00:59:21,020
O ha, direct hit. That's it for the frat.

916
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:25,110
We stand.

917
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:27,110
That's very cool.

918
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:31,420
Stance.

919
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:34,400
Ready.

920
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:36,400
Hit yourselves.

921
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:42,310
Halt.

922
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:55,060
Withdrawel.

923
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,260
High Impartial. Austria Graz withdraws after loss of substance.

924
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:05,110
And thanks for the mensur bout.

925
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,910
Partie Ex. Silencium Ex.

926
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:16,660
Yes, but it was still worth it, wasn't it Geier?

927
01:00:20,930 --> 01:00:24,620
There you can see, that you always have to keep your defense up, Scharrenberg.

928
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:28,840
Defense is for frats and cowards.
Come on.

929
01:00:41,730 --> 01:00:44,800
Hey guys. Sunk again in the bar?

930
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,040
Hangs.

931
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:49,020
Cheers my dear Cheers.

932
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,440
Get that down there.

933
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:02,930
Hey how are you?

934
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:04,930
Crappy.

935
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:09,555
Yes, then we should have another beer right away.
Then you'll feel better.

936
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,350
Fox Student.

937
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:20,750
Tell me, is something wrong?

938
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:25,200
There is simply nothing right at all anymore.

939
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:28,570
I can't get anything done.

940
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:34,660
The Corps is taking up far too much time.

941
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:37,730
I don't go to university anymore.

942
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:43,110
I'm drunk again and It's not even twelve.

943
01:01:43,110 --> 01:01:47,280
Oh David. It's always like this in the first Fox Semester.

944
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,288
Of course it's tough.

945
01:01:49,466 --> 01:01:52,080
But we don't want to include everyone in our Corps either.

946
01:01:52,266 --> 01:01:55,150
We select our people very specifically.

947
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:57,150
Do you understand.

948
01:01:57,330 --> 01:02:01,280
And now you've got your first Fox Fuss and would like to throw it all away.

949
01:02:01,730 --> 01:02:04,933
It has happened to all of us. You have to go through that now.

950
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,130
Or do you want to give up?

951
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,130
Just like that.

952
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:12,220
Like Hubertus.

953
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:16,130
Cheer up my dear. It will get better soon. Believe me.

954
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:19,110
Listen. Next Semester you will probably become a full member.

955
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:22,440
Then you're a Corps boy and get your own Foxes.

956
01:02:22,750 --> 01:02:26,080
Your own Foxes, and they do the dirty work for you and you go to university.

957
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:30,480
That's how it has worked for over 200 years.

958
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,330
Tell me what's your really the problem?

959
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:42,930
I'm really scared of fencing.

960
01:02:44,350 --> 01:02:48,130
I was just on one of these PPs from ...

961
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:52,570
From such a right wing fraternity. What's their name again?

962
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:53,820
Germanen?

963
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:59,240
Yes, exactly the Germans and such a totally disgusting Austrian fraternity.

964
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:04,840
The guys looked so ugly later. I don't want to end like this.

965
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:07,820
Moment. Did you see this PP?

966
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:10,130
Who took you there?

967
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:12,570
Well, Richert and Geier.

968
01:03:12,710 --> 01:03:16,400
Oh yes, our Buxen. Yes everything is clear now.

969
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:18,750
No, Richert und Geier.

970
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,820
Exactly. These are the Buxen in our Corps.

971
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:25,020
Geier must have done that especially to scare you.

972
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:30,350
David, you don't have to worry about fencing at all.

973
01:03:30,350 --> 01:03:33,730
Yes, take a look at our faces. Do you see a scar somewhere?

974
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,800
Everyone got through the Mensur cleanly, even Wiener.

975
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:39,420
Don't worry, we'll prepare you properly.

976
01:03:40,130 --> 01:03:42,844
Nothing will happen to your handsome face.

977
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:48,220
David, I have something for you.

978
01:03:51,110 --> 01:03:51,550
Here.

979
01:03:52,970 --> 01:03:54,260
Wow.

980
01:03:55,910 --> 01:03:57,733
What do you need the medal for?

981
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:00,970
This is a ribbon button. This holds the ribbon in place.

982
01:04:01,150 --> 01:04:03,060
Come on, I'll show you.

983
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:05,510
What's the matter with your ribbon?

984
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:13,150
So, you put this in here and then it finally looks like something.

985
01:04:14,710 --> 01:04:16,000
So my dear...

986
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,570
What's the program for tonight?

987
01:04:18,570 --> 01:04:20,350
How about a lady visit?

988
01:04:20,350 --> 01:04:23,330
We haven't had a lady visit for weeks.

989
01:04:23,370 --> 01:04:26,000
Yes, relax.
I'm in.

990
01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:35,060
Foxes. Fun. Yes.

991
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:38,620
How are things here?

992
01:04:39,370 --> 01:04:40,970
Tidy up the House.

993
01:04:43,370 --> 01:04:45,640
Fencing practice as usual. 6pm. On time.

994
01:04:46,310 --> 01:04:47,640
Not a second later.

995
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:51,110
What kind of shitty mood is that?

996
01:04:52,570 --> 01:04:54,040
Get me a Beer Boy David.

997
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:16,970
The Corps hosted an elegant cocktail party every semester.

998
01:05:16,970 --> 01:05:20,570
A strict alcohol ban was issued by the Corps Convention.

999
01:05:20,570 --> 01:05:25,820
So that we were able to serve the guests
and make a good impression on the student body.

1000
01:05:30,930 --> 01:05:35,020
Foxes, I need two Mai Tai here and hurry!
We don't want to let the ladies die of thirst.

1001
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:36,570
Shit, what is in the Mai Tai?

1002
01:05:36,570 --> 01:05:39,950
Scharrenberg, where are the cocktails?
Stop talking. Start mixing.

1003
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:43,510
Great, well done. Krause my Fox Student.

1004
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:55,420
Thank god. Geier really is getting on my nerves.

1005
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:57,420
Krause is no better, believe me.

1006
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:00,800
Here, Relax. Calm down.

1007
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:03,060
The alcohol ban?

1008
01:06:03,550 --> 01:06:06,080
Just don't drink so much and don't tell anyone.

1009
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:07,910
Cheers my Fox Student. Cheers Mentor.

1010
01:06:11,110 --> 01:06:12,750
A Vodka-O please.

1011
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:16,040
Vodka what?

1012
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:17,460
O please.

1013
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:22,040
Krause. A Vodka-O and quickly, yes.

1014
01:06:28,170 --> 01:06:29,770
Today if possible.

1015
01:06:30,711 --> 01:06:32,400
Are you new to this fraternity?

1016
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,130
Yes, you can say so.

1017
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:38,222
But you haven't picked the best one here in town.

1018
01:06:38,310 --> 01:06:39,640
Badly mixed drinks.

1019
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,260
Bulky dancers.

1020
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:43,600
And lousy DJ.

1021
01:06:44,220 --> 01:06:46,170
By the way, my name is Julia.

1022
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:47,330
Fox Scharrenberg.

1023
01:06:49,550 --> 01:06:51,600
I mean David.

1024
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:55,860
Thank you darling. I know that you are still a Fox.

1025
01:07:03,330 --> 01:07:08,350
Man, she is hot.
I'd like to bone her, you know.

1026
01:07:08,350 --> 01:07:11,150
Get lost Fox. Away with you, you stinky Fox.

1027
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,330
Oh Jankwitz, did you see her?

1028
01:07:13,330 --> 01:07:15,910
Yes, but you better forget her right away.

1029
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:18,970
She is not in your league. You can get her, but you can't keep her.

1030
01:07:19,022 --> 01:07:21,377
She goes out with the son of our old member Mr. Pfander.

1031
01:07:21,466 --> 01:07:23,466
Pfander. The Interior Minister?

1032
01:07:23,555 --> 01:07:24,711
Yes the interior minister.

1033
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:27,060
Is the Pfander's son also a Corps Brother?

1034
01:07:27,060 --> 01:07:29,330
No that not. The father is enough.

1035
01:07:30,310 --> 01:07:32,710
So leave it. Believe me. She is trouble.

1036
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:38,130
Brandt, why Geier is entertaining your girlfriend?

1037
01:07:38,570 --> 01:07:40,880
Come on. As long as I don't have to dance.

1038
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:42,880
Another champagne please.

1039
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:47,200
Tell me, do you have to work here all evening?

1040
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:48,350
Actually yes.

1041
01:07:48,350 --> 01:07:51,820
It's a shame because I would love to dance.

1042
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:09,640
Doesn't your boyfriend get jealous?

1043
01:08:10,530 --> 01:08:11,640
Which boyfriend?

1044
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:15,730
I thought you were with Pfander's son.

1045
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:18,570
Not any longer.

1046
01:09:03,510 --> 01:09:04,260
Wait!

1047
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:08,350
Fuchs Scharrenberg. There you are. You may have nerve.

1048
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:13,240
What are you doing out here?
Especially during one of our Corps Events. Hello.

1049
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:17,020
That's what I call Ex-kneipen and you come in with us right now.

1050
01:09:17,111 --> 01:09:18,755
No, that's not possible Richert.

1051
01:09:19,150 --> 01:09:20,310
Let me pass.

1052
01:09:20,310 --> 01:09:22,310
Shut up Fox!

1053
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:25,422
Come with me now, otherwise you can forget about the Corps right now.

1054
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:28,000
I'll kick you out if you don't come with. Now!

1055
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:30,570
Shit!

1056
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:33,550
Shit, shit, shit, you screwed up!

1057
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:37,511
That will have consequences, I guarantee you.
I'll bring that to the Corps Convent.

1058
01:09:37,644 --> 01:09:39,110
Asshole Richert. Asshole.

1059
01:09:39,110 --> 01:09:40,880
Nothing asshole.

1060
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:47,020
Man man Scharrenberg. Why didn't you listen to me?
Now you've screwed up a lot.

1061
01:09:47,730 --> 01:09:49,460
Yeah man i'm sorry.

1062
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:54,080
I could not think clearly. There was this girl.

1063
01:09:55,950 --> 01:09:59,420
I mean she totally turned my head. You know that.

1064
01:10:01,110 --> 01:10:02,750
Alright. Listen up.

1065
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:06,711
If you do exactly what we tell you,
you'll come out of this reasonably clean.

1066
01:10:06,750 --> 01:10:09,240
You say that you left because of a girl ...

1067
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:12,480
... but with any one. No way with this Julia, do you understand?

1068
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,080
Yes? Yes.

1069
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,440
And only answer when asked.

1070
01:10:17,150 --> 01:10:19,110
And by no means start arguing.

1071
01:10:19,866 --> 01:10:25,688
The best thing to do is to admit your guilt immediately
and assert that it will never happen again. That goes down well.

1072
01:10:27,510 --> 01:10:29,777
Can I get kicked out for something like that?

1073
01:10:30,170 --> 01:10:34,350
Well, it's not that bad. But we will have to punish you.

1074
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:41,820
You stay here. We'll get you.

1075
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:54,310
Hey Scharrenberg. What a horny goat are you.

1076
01:10:55,422 --> 01:10:59,066
Have you completely forgotten the career opportunities the Corps offers you?

1077
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:00,800
A brothel is cheaper.

1078
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,570
Cost benefit factor understood?

1079
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:04,660
Krause. Shut up.

1080
01:11:08,660 --> 01:11:11,240
Scharrenberg. Come in.

1081
01:11:20,710 --> 01:11:22,130
Stand there Scharrenberg.

1082
01:11:41,370 --> 01:11:46,440
So gentlemen. I hereby open the second Corps Convent in the summer semester 2020.

1083
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:51,550
We are negotiating the criminal complaint
that Corps Boy Richert brought up against Fox Scharrenberg.

1084
01:11:51,550 --> 01:11:51,555
We are negotiating the criminal complaint
that Corps Boy Richert brought up against Fox Scharrenberg.
Please Richert.

1085
01:11:51,555 --> 01:11:53,020
Please Richert.

1086
01:11:57,330 --> 01:12:00,880
I hereby file a criminal complaint against Fox Scharrenberg.

1087
01:12:01,510 --> 01:12:05,060
Scharrenberg left the cocktail party without permission.

1088
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:10,000
Not only did he leave an official Corps Event without excuse.

1089
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:14,660
But he also abandoned his Corps Brothers who had to do his job.

1090
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:21,680
Later, I found him in front of the house, drunk and with a girl.

1091
01:12:22,530 --> 01:12:32,310
Yes, with that, he not only left without excuse, but also stayed outside the Corp House,
as a Fox in our colors unaccompanied by a Corp Brother.

1092
01:12:32,530 --> 01:12:36,660
Last but not least, Scharrenberg disregarded the alcohol ban...

1093
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:43,600
... and at first even refused to follow the instructions of a Corps Boy,
in present of foreign fraternity members...

1094
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:47,950
And when I was about to get him to go back to the Corp House with me.

1095
01:12:47,950 --> 01:12:49,110
Thank you.

1096
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:55,860
Well, Scharrenberg, these are serious accusations.
What do you have to say in your defense?

1097
01:12:57,910 --> 01:12:59,330
Should I say something now?

1098
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:00,620
Yes please.

1099
01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:06,000
I am very sorry.

1100
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:10,350
I don't know what got into me either.

1101
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:13,020
Ah, so you admit it?

1102
01:13:13,730 --> 01:13:14,620
Yes.

1103
01:13:15,770 --> 01:13:19,330
Yes, I plead guilty on all counts and ...

1104
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,910
... I'm really, really sorry.

1105
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:25,280
Why did you have a drink despite the alcohol ban?

1106
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,066
You knew that you were not allowed to drink alcohol.

1107
01:13:30,350 --> 01:13:31,770
I kind of forgot.

1108
01:13:32,750 --> 01:13:37,200
Forgot? You don't forget something like that, Fox!

1109
01:13:37,510 --> 01:13:40,040
Man Wiener, why are you picking on me now?

1110
01:13:40,570 --> 01:13:42,711
You're my Fellow Fox, you don´t tell me what i do.

1111
01:13:43,770 --> 01:13:47,950
Corps Boy Wiener. More respect Fox, if I may ask.

1112
01:13:47,950 --> 01:13:49,420
Slow down Wiener.

1113
01:13:49,770 --> 01:13:53,510
Do I need to remind you how often you've broken the alcohol ban?

1114
01:13:53,510 --> 01:13:56,620
Or how often I had to cram you out on other corp houses.

1115
01:13:56,620 --> 01:13:58,970
Brandt. That's not an argument.

1116
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:03,511
When you defend your Grandson Fox, stay objective and don't attack others.

1117
01:14:03,733 --> 01:14:05,022
Excuse me Senior.

1118
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:06,440
Back to the topic.

1119
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:11,370
Scharrenberg, you still haven't told us the reason
why you just ran away like that.

1120
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:14,130
Well.

1121
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:17,770
It was because of a girl.

1122
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:21,240
She really wanted me to go with her and ...

1123
01:14:21,910 --> 01:14:23,240
I couldn't say no.

1124
01:14:23,950 --> 01:14:26,530
Yes, and who was that girl?

1125
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:29,280
I don't remember, I've forgotten her name.

1126
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:30,800
Because you were so drunk?

1127
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:37,420
The Fox runs around drunk with some chick in front of the house
and drags our colors to the dirt.

1128
01:14:38,130 --> 01:14:39,777
That's incredible, isn't it ?!

1129
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:43,688
So you don´t show up for own Mensur when you're on a date?

1130
01:14:44,170 --> 01:14:49,330
You know that would be real problem.
In my capacity as Consenior, I would have take your place.

1131
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:53,020
No of course not. The Corps has absolute priority!

1132
01:14:57,110 --> 01:14:58,750
I am really very sorry.

1133
01:15:00,710 --> 01:15:02,080
You see, he apologized.

1134
01:15:02,570 --> 01:15:03,680
But that's not enough.

1135
01:15:04,710 --> 01:15:07,822
Scharrenberg, you're not getting your studies done at all.

1136
01:15:07,950 --> 01:15:10,488
When was the last time you were in a lecture?

1137
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,970
Do you have a lesson plan for example?

1138
01:15:13,910 --> 01:15:14,620
Yes.

1139
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:16,750
You're right.

1140
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:19,820
The Corps is taking too much of me.

1141
01:15:19,820 --> 01:15:22,840
That is not an excuse. Study always comes first!

1142
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:26,660
Studies must never suffer from activity.
Am I right Wiener? Yes!

1143
01:15:26,970 --> 01:15:29,370
You know we have to pass exams, don't you?

1144
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:33,200
I hope you know what that means.

1145
01:15:33,244 --> 01:15:39,288
We've already had to part with many dear Corps Brothers,
because they failed at their exams.

1146
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:41,244
Life's not always all about fun.

1147
01:15:41,333 --> 01:15:43,600
Silentium Geier. Silentium.

1148
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:47,155
That is not the subject of discussion now.

1149
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:53,466
Thank you Scharrenberg. It is enough.

1150
01:15:53,910 --> 01:15:56,660
Culpability is given. You can see that yourself.

1151
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,060
You can go now.

1152
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:02,488
We will negotiate the sentence and then call you back inside.

1153
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:07,420
Cheer up Scharrenberg.

1154
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:10,844
Have a quick one. Then you'll feel better again.

1155
01:16:10,930 --> 01:16:14,800
Krause leave me alone. I don't drink any more.

1156
01:16:17,910 --> 01:16:19,280
Never again.

1157
01:16:24,977 --> 01:16:31,240
So Scharrenberg, taking into account that you haven't been with us that long
and that you are also understanding ...

1158
01:16:31,466 --> 01:16:34,755
... the Corps Convent has decided to suspend you for 2 weeks.

1159
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:37,866
You will receive a work order from the Corps Convention.

1160
01:16:37,911 --> 01:16:41,644
You will clean up the beer cellar before the next convention.

1161
01:16:41,910 --> 01:16:46,480
And you'll take care of our Corp Dog Brutus
and walk the dog at least three times a day.

1162
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:53,600
During the time you are suspended, you are not allowed to wear our colors,
or go to other fraternity houses.

1163
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,800
Not even in the company of other Corps Brothers.

1164
01:16:57,460 --> 01:17:01,910
Nevertheless, you still have the duty to
attend all official Corps Events.

1165
01:17:03,110 --> 01:17:04,666
Do you accept this punishment?

1166
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:05,688
Absolutely!

1167
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:09,510
And I wanted to say again that I'm really, really sorry and ...

1168
01:17:10,170 --> 01:17:13,330
I will get better in the future. It never happens again.

1169
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:14,880
Would be better for you.

1170
01:17:15,730 --> 01:17:18,711
You can understand this punishment as a yellow card.

1171
01:17:19,550 --> 01:17:22,311
One more thing and you out! I guarantee you that.

1172
01:17:23,150 --> 01:17:28,480
Well. I hereby close the Corps Convention at32 pm.
You can leave now.

1173
01:17:28,530 --> 01:17:30,930
Thank you dear Corps Brothers.

1174
01:17:33,288 --> 01:17:36,444
Oh Scharrenberg, one more thing. You have to give me your ribbon.

1175
01:17:36,533 --> 01:17:40,133
I will keep it for you and give it back after your sentence expires.

1176
01:17:46,260 --> 01:17:48,530
Yes, I hope you see this as an opportunity.

1177
01:17:49,510 --> 01:17:50,880
You have to get better.

1178
01:17:50,970 --> 01:17:51,910
Gentlemen.

1179
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:10,260
Suddenly, the fun was over.

1180
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:15,111
For the first time I noticed
how seriously everything had to be taken here.

1181
01:18:15,330 --> 01:18:17,020
Even when jokes were cracked.

1182
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:22,350
They were right about their allegations and I decided to become better.

1183
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:24,930
As a Corp Student and otherwise.

1184
01:18:35,150 --> 01:18:37,640
Fox. Phone.

1185
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:42,530
Twenty one, twenty two. Twenty three.

1186
01:18:42,530 --> 01:18:46,310
Ah Scharrenberg. It's a beer.

1187
01:18:46,660 --> 01:18:50,170
Corps Teutonia, Fox Scharrenberg good evening.

1188
01:18:52,570 --> 01:18:54,000
Speaking.

1189
01:18:54,710 --> 01:18:55,510
Drink.

1190
01:18:55,820 --> 01:18:57,020
Wait a second.

1191
01:19:06,170 --> 01:19:07,020
See you later.

1192
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,570
So friends.

1193
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:46,933
Now you are learning how to drink properly as a Corps Student.

1194
01:19:47,420 --> 01:19:49,950
Let's see if you are any good as a Corp Student.

1195
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:52,930
Gentlemen, let's do some straight talking here.

1196
01:19:53,820 --> 01:19:58,400
This is where the wheat is separated from the chaff.
A case of beer for everyone.

1197
01:19:58,710 --> 01:20:04,880
And you can't go to bed until the tub is full and the beer is empty.
Are we clear?

1198
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:09,020
Say Wiener. You still know it goes, right?

1199
01:20:09,020 --> 01:20:12,040
Show your former Fellow Foxes how to drink properly.

1200
01:20:12,220 --> 01:20:13,280
Why me?

1201
01:20:14,710 --> 01:20:15,820
Richert can do it.

1202
01:20:15,820 --> 01:20:16,620
So.

1203
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:20,620
Hey Wiener, haven't you heard
what your Consenior told you?

1204
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,260
This is an order, is that clear?

1205
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:26,800
Yes, high Consenior.

1206
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:31,240
No chit-chat Wiener. Drink!

1207
01:20:31,330 --> 01:20:36,880
You know what... You are now doing the whole program.

1208
01:20:41,910 --> 01:20:43,200
That's how you do it.

1209
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:08,440
Pull through. Yes sir.

1210
01:21:08,570 --> 01:21:14,220
Corps Brother Wiener demonstrated how it's done. Let's go. Hurry up.

1211
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,440
Get rid of it. Put it away.

1212
01:21:52,170 --> 01:21:54,660
I give up. I've have enough.

1213
01:21:58,710 --> 01:21:59,640
I cannot.

1214
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:00,930
We will make it.

1215
01:22:00,930 --> 01:22:04,000
Hey guys, I've been through this before.

1216
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:08,530
Make some effort! Start drinking properly!
Keep going. No more dramatic pause.

1217
01:22:08,530 --> 01:22:10,660
Drink like men. We don't have all day.

1218
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:14,620
Come on Hain. We're all going through the same, yeah.

1219
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:16,310
Do not give up.

1220
01:22:16,310 --> 01:22:19,820
Come on, you whimper. Get to the beer front!

1221
01:22:19,820 --> 01:22:24,000
Richert, you bastard. Sadist! I can not anymore.

1222
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:27,860
Leave me alone. I want to get out of here.

1223
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:31,110
Shut up Fox. You're drinking this now.

1224
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:33,020
You loser.

1225
01:22:33,020 --> 01:22:35,600
I just can't take it anymore. I want to get out of here.

1226
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:38,170
I want to get out of here. I want to go home!

1227
01:22:38,710 --> 01:22:40,480
Pull yourself together Fox! Okay?

1228
01:22:40,660 --> 01:22:43,950
If you give up now, then you are no longer be one off us.

1229
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:47,280
Kröger, leave him alone,
You can see he's screwed.

1230
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,280
Hain, that's it. You are out.

1231
01:22:49,550 --> 01:22:50,620
And goodbye.

1232
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:53,288
Hey, where do you want to go?

1233
01:22:53,422 --> 01:22:54,840
Don't touch me!

1234
01:22:56,170 --> 01:22:58,622
Do you want to get violent now or what?

1235
01:22:59,110 --> 01:23:00,840
This is my Fellow Fox!

1236
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:03,820
He was your Fellow Fox. Forget him.

1237
01:23:04,130 --> 01:23:06,888
He wouldn't have been a good Corps Student anyway, okay?

1238
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:10,350
Richert, you owe me 50 euros.

1239
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,170
Yes, sure.

1240
01:23:12,350 --> 01:23:13,820
What are you staring at?

1241
01:23:14,170 --> 01:23:16,800
Did anyone tell you to stop drinking?

1242
01:23:17,420 --> 01:23:20,800
You don't stop until we say that, is that clear?

1243
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:25,020
That's how it works here!

1244
01:23:25,060 --> 01:23:27,020
We drink on and on.

1245
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:30,080
I felt nothing. I was completely exhausted.

1246
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:31,730
I didn't care at all about Hain.

1247
01:23:31,730 --> 01:23:31,733
I didn't care at all about Hain.
To be honest, I was just angry at him because we had to drink his remaining beers.

1248
01:23:31,733 --> 01:23:37,370
To be honest, I was just angry at him because we had to drink his remaining beers.

1249
01:23:37,550 --> 01:23:39,020
We never saw Hain again.

1250
01:23:39,460 --> 01:23:43,060
He left the Corps House early the next morning without comment.

1251
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:45,640
Nobody wept a tear after him.

1252
01:23:56,040 --> 01:24:00,220
Here David. Your ribbon. The two weeks are up.

1253
01:24:00,260 --> 01:24:01,770
Make something of it.

1254
01:24:01,950 --> 01:24:03,150
You can count on me.

1255
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:08,260
Elisabeth, you look lovely.

1256
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:10,000
Many Thanks.

1257
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,488
May I introduce you to our new Fox Scharrenberg.

1258
01:24:12,533 --> 01:24:14,220
Good day. I welcome you Madam.

1259
01:24:14,350 --> 01:24:17,420
But what is that? Please don't be so formal.

1260
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:18,660
Howdy Fox.

1261
01:24:18,660 --> 01:24:20,130
Oh hello.

1262
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:22,622
Give me my regards to your daughter.

1263
01:24:23,020 --> 01:24:27,510
Elisabeth is the wife of our old Member Mr. Raul.

1264
01:24:27,910 --> 01:24:32,570
Mr. Raul is the CEO of one of the largest industrial groups in Germany.

1265
01:24:32,710 --> 01:24:34,570
Revenue in the billions.

1266
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:37,640
Selling ​​weapons to the entire world.

1267
01:24:37,860 --> 01:24:40,660
Tanks, assault rifles, submarines, the whole product line.

1268
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:44,080
The main customer is the German Army.

1269
01:24:45,860 --> 01:24:46,750
And who is this?

1270
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:50,170
I was just about to say.
This is our old member, Mr. Mueller the third.

1271
01:24:50,260 --> 01:24:52,844
He is the State Secretary in the Ministry of Defense.

1272
01:24:52,933 --> 01:24:56,133
Of course, he and Mr. Raul always have a lot to talk about.

1273
01:24:56,177 --> 01:24:59,022
It then comes down to budgets in the billions.

1274
01:24:59,150 --> 01:25:01,911
I am a Lieutenant and study in the Military University.

1275
01:25:02,310 --> 01:25:05,820
After graduation, I will work for the Department of Defense.

1276
01:25:05,820 --> 01:25:05,822
After graduation, I will work for the Department of Defense.
The gentleman back there is the Vice Chancellor and Minister of Economics of Austria.

1277
01:25:05,822 --> 01:25:11,420
The gentleman back there is the Vice Chancellor and Minister of Economics of Austria.

1278
01:25:12,310 --> 01:25:13,860
Is he also a Corps Men?

1279
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:15,860
No. He is a Religious Frat.

1280
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:18,170
He's in a non-fencing catholic fraternity.

1281
01:25:18,710 --> 01:25:22,350
But they have been in power in Austria for decades.
I wonder how?

1282
01:25:23,022 --> 01:25:27,511
Fencing Duels are not tolerated by church.
But that is an excuse, if you ask me.

1283
01:25:28,220 --> 01:25:30,533
But you know, in the end it doesn't matter.

1284
01:25:30,710 --> 01:25:32,800
One and the same kind.

1285
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:36,266
You got to be in a fraternity. We know our people.

1286
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:37,777
Sick.

1287
01:25:41,420 --> 01:25:43,733
Do you see the little bitch sitting there?

1288
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:46,880
This is the daughter of our old member Mr. Raul.

1289
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:52,080
I banged her at the garden party last year in our beer basement.

1290
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:56,570
She squealed like a stabbed piglet.

1291
01:25:57,860 --> 01:25:59,060
Contenance.

1292
01:25:59,770 --> 01:26:00,880
Richert.

1293
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:02,710
Gentlemen.

1294
01:26:02,710 --> 01:26:04,710
Walter Pfander is sitting over there.

1295
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:06,710
He is the interior minister's son.

1296
01:26:07,150 --> 01:26:09,066
Please take special care of him.

1297
01:26:09,910 --> 01:26:11,370
Try to make him a member.

1298
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:14,970
Just put a ribbon on him before someone else does it.

1299
01:26:16,570 --> 01:26:17,150
I beg you.

1300
01:26:24,970 --> 01:26:28,710
Dear Corps Brothers, dear families, dear guests.

1301
01:26:29,510 --> 01:26:34,310
Our Corps is strong, demographically healthy
and is proud, like every semester ...

1302
01:26:34,620 --> 01:26:38,130
... about a large number of good, new Foxes.

1303
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:44,710
And looking at our active ones, my inner feeling confirms...

1304
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:49,060
... that we are on the right path with the alignment of our Corps.

1305
01:26:49,330 --> 01:26:54,040
I have the greatest respect for these young and older Corps Brothers.

1306
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:57,150
Whom have decided to live by our values.

1307
01:26:57,330 --> 01:27:02,040
And defend the heritage of our covenant.

1308
01:27:02,170 --> 01:27:07,330
That at a time when values ​​and traditions are needed.

1309
01:27:07,511 --> 01:27:11,910
Since they threaten to disappear more and more from the consciousness of our people.

1310
01:27:11,910 --> 01:27:14,620
At this point, however, it should be said;

1311
01:27:14,930 --> 01:27:17,910
We don't see ourselves as an elite.

1312
01:27:19,150 --> 01:27:21,511
But when we are needed,

1313
01:27:21,860 --> 01:27:24,088
then we don't deny our responsibility!

1314
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:29,420
Honor, loyalty, honesty, morality.

1315
01:27:29,550 --> 01:27:33,820
These are all values ​​that we stand by and are worth fighting for.

1316
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:38,930
Because they are often denied and thus the cohesion of society is threatened.

1317
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:45,910
Of course, standing for those values, doesn't mean we can´t have fun times in our fraternity life.

1318
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:53,510
I like to remind you of our regular events and our spontaneous evening activities.

1319
01:27:53,510 --> 01:27:56,970
Which will certainly not be forgotten.

1320
01:27:57,910 --> 01:28:00,260
But I have to urge caution.

1321
01:28:00,620 --> 01:28:02,750
We are non-political.

1322
01:28:03,330 --> 01:28:07,600
There are still very severe deficits in the public perception of the Corps.

1323
01:28:08,620 --> 01:28:11,330
That also means that we have to set ourselves apart.

1324
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:15,240
Of revanchism and revisionist ambitions.

1325
01:28:15,950 --> 01:28:21,910
Dear Corps Brothers and Friends,
even if patience is a virtue, and time heals all wounds.

1326
01:28:22,310 --> 01:28:26,350
We must move forward in healthy patriotism.

1327
01:28:26,350 --> 01:28:31,370
And must never leave the field to the right-wing extremists!

1328
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:32,400
Splendid.

1329
01:28:33,020 --> 01:28:36,620
Anyone who wants to disrupt the social democratic system.

1330
01:28:37,110 --> 01:28:41,150
Everyone who spreads fake news and denies life-threatening climate change.

1331
01:28:41,550 --> 01:28:44,570
Deserves the social criticism in full force.

1332
01:28:45,460 --> 01:28:48,220
With that in mind, I would like to ask everyone...

1333
01:28:48,660 --> 01:28:54,970
... to rub a thundering salamander on an everlasting Vivat Crescat of our dear Teutonia.

1334
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:58,310
Vivat, Vivat, Vivat.

1335
01:29:04,530 --> 01:29:08,000
David, David, Fox Scharrenberg, wake up.

1336
01:29:08,170 --> 01:29:09,866
It's time for your mensur bout.

1337
01:29:10,088 --> 01:29:15,550
What's wrong with you? Now you have to be wide awake.
Wake up you sleepyhead.

1338
01:29:16,170 --> 01:29:19,240
Don't listen, just focus on yourself.

1339
01:29:20,750 --> 01:29:22,000
This is where it’s at!

1340
01:29:26,660 --> 01:29:31,370
Hold on tight here Wiener. Yes I got it. OK.

1341
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:35,200
Too tight?

1342
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:36,800
Can't you make it so tight, please?

1343
01:29:36,977 --> 01:29:38,170
No, that's exactly right.

1344
01:29:38,260 --> 01:29:41,244
We don't want a blade getting lost near your carotid artery.

1345
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:43,730
Here have a drink. You are way too nervous.

1346
01:29:44,350 --> 01:29:47,510
Don't be afraid. We have practiced this a thousand times.

1347
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:49,510
I've trained you well.

1348
01:29:49,770 --> 01:29:53,460
You defense is tight. Everything's alright.
Nothing can happen to you my boy.

1349
01:29:54,350 --> 01:29:57,730
Besides, the other Fox is just as scared as you are.

1350
01:29:58,970 --> 01:30:04,440
Stay calm, concentrate on your strikes and then it's over in no time.

1351
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:06,970
In 20 minutes you will laugh about it.

1352
01:30:18,970 --> 01:30:20,800
Swab here.

1353
01:30:31,860 --> 01:30:35,600
It´s not that bad, David. It's just a small cut.

1354
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:39,150
Don't be scared now, yeah.

1355
01:30:41,820 --> 01:30:45,240
You go out there now and finish off the fucker!

1356
01:30:47,060 --> 01:30:49,280
Don't piss your pants.

1357
01:30:49,370 --> 01:30:51,460
Nothing happens in the Fox Mensur. Never.

1358
01:30:52,710 --> 01:30:54,750
So Scharrenberg, it's time.

1359
01:30:54,750 --> 01:30:56,750
We must. Come on. Let´s go.

1360
01:31:57,770 --> 01:31:59,770
Good luck in the fight. Knock him off.

1361
01:32:02,930 --> 01:32:07,510
Luck in the fight. Focus. Like in training.
You will do it. Good luck.

1362
01:32:11,510 --> 01:32:13,150
Luck and a sharp blade.

1363
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:20,710
Listen up Scharrenberg. Now comes the honor round.

1364
01:32:21,550 --> 01:32:24,533
Your blades touch on top and then you take your arm down.

1365
01:32:24,660 --> 01:32:27,770
Concentrate now. Do not strike.

1366
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,377
Otherwise the Mensur won´t count and you'll have to fence again next week.

1367
01:32:46,130 --> 01:32:47,822
Turn around.

1368
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:51,280
Height adjustment.

1369
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:06,620
I hereby open the first Ordinary Open Air Determination Day in the summer semester 2020.

1370
01:33:06,970 --> 01:33:12,530
I'm announcing a simple blade Mensur between my Corps Brother Scharrenberg on my left,

1371
01:33:12,530 --> 01:33:16,750
and on my right side the honorable representative of the Corps Suevia, Mr. Kehl.

1372
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:19,420
The word is now with the seconds.

1373
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:23,550
The beginning and ending command will be on our side.

1374
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:26,350
The first strike will be on our side.

1375
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:29,240
I have nothing more to anounce.

1376
01:33:29,820 --> 01:33:31,240
In position.

1377
01:33:39,020 --> 01:33:41,150
Up please for the honor round.

1378
01:33:47,420 --> 01:33:48,310
Ready.

1379
01:33:49,770 --> 01:33:50,350
Go.

1380
01:33:57,240 --> 01:33:59,770
So Scharrenberg, now it's getting serious.

1381
01:33:59,950 --> 01:34:03,510
You only hit primes at first, yes! No experiments.

1382
01:34:03,730 --> 01:34:06,488
And don't strike before the go. And always keep going.

1383
01:34:06,570 --> 01:34:07,860
In no case stop.

1384
01:34:08,170 --> 01:34:11,020
The round is not over before you hear the word halt.

1385
01:34:13,550 --> 01:34:15,644
Luck and a sharp blade my boy.

1386
01:34:18,130 --> 01:34:19,420
In position please.

1387
01:34:22,170 --> 01:34:24,570
Up, please, to the first sharp round.

1388
01:34:26,660 --> 01:34:27,600
Ready.

1389
01:34:29,370 --> 01:34:30,130
Go.

1390
01:34:35,770 --> 01:34:36,880
Halt.

1391
01:34:39,510 --> 01:34:41,820
Take it easy. You are doing great.

1392
01:34:41,820 --> 01:34:44,133
Everything is fine, just not so wild please.

1393
01:34:44,222 --> 01:34:46,660
Ok, easy. You don't necessarily want to hit him.

1394
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:49,466
You just have to go the distance. Okay. Keep it up.

1395
01:34:53,550 --> 01:34:56,570
In position please.

1396
01:34:57,280 --> 01:35:00,130
Up, please, for the second sharp round.

1397
01:35:01,420 --> 01:35:02,530
Ready.

1398
01:35:03,060 --> 01:35:03,770
Go.

1399
01:35:07,550 --> 01:35:08,310
Halt.

1400
01:35:11,150 --> 01:35:14,750
After the first few rounds, my opponent and I had found our rhythm.

1401
01:35:15,020 --> 01:35:19,640
Of course, no one wanted to get hurt, no risky strikes.

1402
01:35:20,170 --> 01:35:24,570
I fought like a machine, executed my fencing routine.

1403
01:35:24,930 --> 01:35:28,350
Strike, turn, pull up, strike, turn away again.

1404
01:35:28,750 --> 01:35:31,860
Quart, prime, prime, quart, terz.

1405
01:35:31,910 --> 01:35:34,888
Practiced a thousand times. It was almost like riding a bike.

1406
01:35:34,930 --> 01:35:36,711
Then everything went very fast.

1407
01:35:36,755 --> 01:35:39,111
Listen, one final round, that´s it.

1408
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:41,420
Understood? Alright, keep it up.

1409
01:35:45,680 --> 01:35:48,080
Up please for the final sharp round.

1410
01:35:50,220 --> 01:35:51,950
Ready. Go.

1411
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:57,280
Halt!

1412
01:35:57,510 --> 01:35:59,860
Yes, you did it.

1413
01:36:00,710 --> 01:36:02,350
Fox Student. My dear Fox Student.

1414
01:36:02,350 --> 01:36:06,000
And then. Then everything was over.

1415
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:10,170
So suddenly and quickly, as if the Mensur had never happened.

1416
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:11,820
Cheers. Cheers.

1417
01:36:15,020 --> 01:36:17,680
You were better than me.

1418
01:36:17,860 --> 01:36:20,440
After my harmless Fox Mensur,

1419
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:25,200
... Geier still had to fight his personal contrahage against the Swabian.

1420
01:36:25,860 --> 01:36:31,460
I had the honor, as a so-called Drag Fox, to hold Geier's arm during the breaks.

1421
01:36:32,310 --> 01:36:37,600
I hereby announce a personal contrahage between my Corps Brother Geier on my left,

1422
01:36:37,910 --> 01:36:43,280
and on my right side the Honorable Representative of the Corps Suevia, Mr. Kraftburg.

1423
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:49,550
This contract goes over 45 rounds, five strikes, no honor round, no breaks.

1424
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,170
The word is now with the seconds.

1425
01:36:53,110 --> 01:36:57,820
The beginning and ending commands are on my side.

1426
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:00,750
First strike is on my side.

1427
01:37:01,020 --> 01:37:02,888
I have nothing else to announce.

1428
01:37:03,020 --> 01:37:04,220
Stance.

1429
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:08,400
Up please.

1430
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:13,330
Geier started out strong, as expected.

1431
01:37:13,860 --> 01:37:14,800
Ready.

1432
01:37:15,150 --> 01:37:15,680
Go.

1433
01:37:18,570 --> 01:37:19,020
Halt.

1434
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:26,660
Geier, calm down. You still have 40 rounds ahead of you.

1435
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:29,600
If you continue like this, you'll run out of breath.

1436
01:37:29,730 --> 01:37:32,844
Hogwosh. I will slash this jumping jack next round.

1437
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:34,170
Okay.

1438
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:36,530
In position.

1439
01:37:39,510 --> 01:37:41,150
Up please for the second round.

1440
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:44,750
Ready. Go.

1441
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:49,460
Halt.

1442
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:55,910
Geier, watch your defense. Your arm must be higher. You are not protected!

1443
01:37:56,310 --> 01:37:59,110
Leave it. I know exactly what I am doing.

1444
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:01,110
Alright.

1445
01:38:04,130 --> 01:38:05,510
In position please.

1446
01:38:16,310 --> 01:38:17,280
Up please.

1447
01:38:19,730 --> 01:38:21,510
Ready. Go.

1448
01:38:26,170 --> 01:38:27,200
Halt.

1449
01:38:28,170 --> 01:38:29,200
Why halt?

1450
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:33,370
Teutonia reports one...

1451
01:38:34,620 --> 01:38:36,000
Down, down, head down.

1452
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:40,400
I correct myself. Two bloody ones.

1453
01:38:45,950 --> 01:38:47,200
Physician.

1454
01:38:47,820 --> 01:38:50,710
Teutonia thanks for the Mensur, and quits because of hit.

1455
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:56,260
Crap.

1456
01:38:58,310 --> 01:38:59,550
Silencium. Mensur Ex.

1457
01:39:03,510 --> 01:39:04,310
What's going on?

1458
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:09,150
Silencium Scharrenberg. Fox Escape.

1459
01:39:09,330 --> 01:39:10,800
Fox Escape?

1460
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:16,930
Fox Escape. Another Corps Student tradition.

1461
01:39:17,420 --> 01:39:21,060
Once a semester, the Foxes flee from their Corps Boys.

1462
01:39:21,060 --> 01:39:26,310
Imagine a scavenger hunt through the fraternity houses in Germany.

1463
01:39:26,970 --> 01:39:31,330
I would like to spare you more precise details.

1464
01:39:31,910 --> 01:39:33,150
Let's go Scharre,

1465
01:40:13,150 --> 01:40:15,333
What's the matter with you man?

1466
01:40:16,350 --> 01:40:18,577
You're totally drunk.

1467
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:23,288
I failed to pass the exam for the second time.

1468
01:40:23,910 --> 01:40:25,110
Shit.

1469
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:30,000
I'm really sorry for that.

1470
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:34,710
Can you try again?

1471
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:41,280
No chance. That´s it.

1472
01:40:43,330 --> 01:40:44,660
Game over!

1473
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:48,620
But hey, David. Do not worry.

1474
01:40:49,550 --> 01:40:51,510
You surely will do better.

1475
01:40:59,020 --> 01:41:05,020
Michael. Please let's talk. Michael. Please wait. Wait.

1476
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:34,480
Do something.

1477
01:41:35,550 --> 01:41:37,330
Somebody call a doctor.

1478
01:42:22,844 --> 01:42:25,511
Please bring me home. I can not stand it any longer.

1479
01:42:33,910 --> 01:42:34,480
Geier.

1480
01:42:38,930 --> 01:42:40,310
What do you want?

1481
01:42:40,750 --> 01:42:43,333
You know that yourself, I think much better.

1482
01:42:45,060 --> 01:42:47,910
Geier you are a disgusting piece of shit.

1483
01:42:48,970 --> 01:42:51,110
I do not know what you're talking about.

1484
01:42:52,130 --> 01:42:56,220
Say what you have to say. Loud and clear Fox or shut up!

1485
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:59,820
I saw what you did.

1486
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:01,420
What did you see?

1487
01:43:01,770 --> 01:43:03,420
You saw nothing at all.

1488
01:43:04,220 --> 01:43:06,440
You made out with Brandt's girlfriend.

1489
01:43:07,680 --> 01:43:08,840
Now he's dead.

1490
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:13,770
So what? I took her.

1491
01:43:14,970 --> 01:43:16,440
She needed a real man.

1492
01:43:17,020 --> 01:43:20,000
Not an impotent loser like Brandt.

1493
01:43:20,310 --> 01:43:24,750
It is not my fault if this mimosa jumps to his death because of it.

1494
01:43:25,860 --> 01:43:28,844
I don't see any legal or moral connection there.

1495
01:43:30,040 --> 01:43:31,510
Disgusting rat.

1496
01:43:31,730 --> 01:43:33,420
Carefully Scharrenberg.

1497
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:35,910
Be very careful with what you say.

1498
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:38,440
I can only repeat it.

1499
01:43:38,750 --> 01:43:42,220
I am not to blame for Brandt jumping.

1500
01:43:44,130 --> 01:43:46,800
The man was incapable of living.

1501
01:43:47,730 --> 01:43:52,620
Did you know that he had failed the exam for the second time.

1502
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:56,970
Maybe it's better for him that way.

1503
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:06,400
Quiet Fox. Take it easy.

1504
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:11,110
I could break your neck now.

1505
01:44:13,890 --> 01:44:15,770
Do what you want Fox.

1506
01:44:15,770 --> 01:44:18,533
But nobody will believe you. You're just a fucking Fox.

1507
01:44:19,022 --> 01:44:22,755
So, pull yourself together, or you'll be out faster than you think.

1508
01:44:23,950 --> 01:44:25,910
And shut up from now on.

1509
01:44:25,910 --> 01:44:27,910
You degenerate noble piece of shit.

1510
01:44:29,460 --> 01:44:30,170
Fuck off.

1511
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:36,260
What's going on here?

1512
01:44:42,977 --> 01:44:44,888
Scharrenberg is becoming a problem.

1513
01:44:47,860 --> 01:44:49,640
How come that effects you?

1514
01:44:54,440 --> 01:44:57,822
I don't want to be with an alcoholi who will kill himself some day.

1515
01:44:57,910 --> 01:45:00,666
Either you break up with the Corps or it's over.

1516
01:45:01,060 --> 01:45:03,020
You're kidding me.

1517
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:07,910
I can not.

1518
01:45:10,350 --> 01:45:11,730
It's not possible.

1519
01:45:14,350 --> 01:45:16,440
What does the Corps have to do with us?

1520
01:45:17,370 --> 01:45:18,080
Wait.

1521
01:45:26,130 --> 01:45:27,680
Take care.

1522
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,240
Godawful.

1523
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:48,660
The semester was coming to an end.

1524
01:45:48,660 --> 01:45:54,350
Jankwitz, Kröger and Geier were inactivated
and thus no longer had any duties on the Corps House.

1525
01:45:54,350 --> 01:45:56,350
Krause was made a full member.

1526
01:45:56,570 --> 01:45:59,600
That means he was given a Corps Boy status early on.

1527
01:45:59,770 --> 01:46:02,710
While I had to serve as a Silver Fox.

1528
01:46:02,970 --> 01:46:05,820
Richert became Senior and Consenior.

1529
01:46:05,820 --> 01:46:07,730
Wiener became Secretary.

1530
01:46:07,730 --> 01:46:11,240
And Krause took over the post of the Fox Major.

1531
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:19,550
Good news. We have two new Foxes.

1532
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:23,370
One of the new Foxes you already know. Walter.

1533
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:26,530
This is Pfander's youngest son.

1534
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:31,600
You know, this is the one whose girlfriend you stole.

1535
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:37,460
Really now?

1536
01:46:38,170 --> 01:46:39,950
No worries. That's alright.

1537
01:46:43,460 --> 01:46:45,200
You look sad.

1538
01:46:46,970 --> 01:46:50,260
Listen. I'm telling you a secret now.

1539
01:46:51,150 --> 01:46:54,880
But you have to give me your word as a Corps Brother to keep that secret.

1540
01:47:00,440 --> 01:47:05,510
Well, Walter, that's not Pfander's real son at all.

1541
01:47:06,970 --> 01:47:09,460
Yes, he has a different father.

1542
01:47:10,660 --> 01:47:16,530
Pfander is always on the road with his duties and Walter has a lot to deal with.

1543
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:26,930
That's why Walter sometimes seems to be a bit strange,
but he's actually a very nice guy.

1544
01:47:26,930 --> 01:47:28,220
Walter.

1545
01:47:28,930 --> 01:47:32,970
Walter. Scharre. Walter has just received the ribbon.

1546
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:36,220
Say hello to your Fellow Fox.

1547
01:47:37,770 --> 01:47:38,530
Beer Boy.

1548
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:41,730
Finished.

1549
01:47:42,310 --> 01:47:43,240
Done.

1550
01:47:45,060 --> 01:47:49,330
You know David, I don't blame you that you stole my girlfriend for a while.

1551
01:47:49,640 --> 01:47:52,080
So she could at least see what she got in me.

1552
01:47:52,750 --> 01:47:55,240
But now she's back. All well again and forgiven.

1553
01:47:55,680 --> 01:47:56,666
I beg your pardon?

1554
01:47:56,840 --> 01:48:01,280
Well, now that we're Corps Brothers, we should try to get along.

1555
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:06,750
At least I'm not a drunk looser.

1556
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:11,150
Tell me Walter, you don't look a lot like your father at all.

1557
01:48:11,550 --> 01:48:12,480
And so what?

1558
01:48:12,620 --> 01:48:15,600
Well, maybe the postman was there.

1559
01:48:20,440 --> 01:48:24,440
Sorry it was just a joke. Do you understand?
The Postman.

1560
01:48:26,570 --> 01:48:28,660
Come on, that's funny, isn't it?

1561
01:48:28,970 --> 01:48:33,020
Fox Scharrenberg. What kind of shit are you talking about here?

1562
01:48:33,020 --> 01:48:35,200
Can't you even keep your mouth shut?

1563
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:40,220
Apologize right now. Immediately, or ...

1564
01:48:40,220 --> 01:48:42,220
Man Richert, that was just a joke.

1565
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:46,220
It’s not my problem if he has no humor.

1566
01:48:46,220 --> 01:48:48,220
Ah, now you're arguing again.

1567
01:48:49,420 --> 01:48:50,930
You apologize now!

1568
01:48:52,930 --> 01:48:54,800
On who´s side are you?

1569
01:48:55,240 --> 01:48:57,422
We have been Corps Brothers way longer.

1570
01:48:57,950 --> 01:48:59,860
The Fox hasn't even fought.

1571
01:49:00,222 --> 01:49:04,220
No, he hasn't fought yet.
And yes, we are longer Corps Brothers. But not for long.

1572
01:49:04,310 --> 01:49:07,330
If you don't apologize right now.

1573
01:49:13,240 --> 01:49:19,280
Ok Scharrenberg. Forget it.
You are done.

1574
01:49:28,220 --> 01:49:32,570
Yes what's up? Yes fine. Yes fine.

1575
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:35,550
Yes fine.

1576
01:49:37,020 --> 01:49:39,460
Yes drink. Drink.

1577
01:49:41,020 --> 01:49:45,020
Hey Fox Major. Yes. Look!

1578
01:49:45,680 --> 01:49:50,080
I got the gun from my father's weapons locker.

1579
01:49:50,620 --> 01:49:53,060
Don't tell, don't tell anybody.

1580
01:49:53,680 --> 01:50:00,530
Okay your father, have you already talked to him?
What about the job in the ministry of interior?

1581
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:05,860
We're going out for dinner next week.
Then you can ask him yourself.

1582
01:50:08,710 --> 01:50:13,370
Yes who is fine. Yes who?

1583
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:17,770
Drink up Brutus, drink up. Fine, drinking!

1584
01:50:22,750 --> 01:50:25,770
You stop that shit. This is cruelty to animals.

1585
01:50:25,950 --> 01:50:27,770
Hey what? What's wrong with you?

1586
01:50:27,910 --> 01:50:31,950
It's a Teutonic hound.
That's a real Teuton.

1587
01:50:32,170 --> 01:50:33,550
Not such a pussy.

1588
01:50:39,110 --> 01:50:42,170
He drinks it. He drinks it. Brutus.

1589
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:49,200
Hey what's the point, why give the good brew to the Corps Dog?

1590
01:50:53,370 --> 01:50:55,020
Fuck, we have to sew this.

1591
01:50:55,860 --> 01:50:57,511
That’s definitely three stitches.

1592
01:50:57,600 --> 01:51:00,444
Scharrenberg, get the sewing kit we need to take care of this.

1593
01:51:00,710 --> 01:51:01,860
Shit.

1594
01:51:02,260 --> 01:51:06,880
Stop it. What are you doing? NO!!!

1595
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:09,020
No, you Bastard!

1596
01:51:10,440 --> 01:51:13,020
Give me the gun. Calm down. Give me the gun!

1597
01:51:13,150 --> 01:51:15,020
Asshole!

1598
01:51:19,910 --> 01:51:21,730
Folks.

1599
01:51:23,020 --> 01:51:25,770
Richert, you call old member Pfander immediately.

1600
01:51:26,040 --> 01:51:29,860
Krause, you take the dog out and bury it immediately.

1601
01:51:30,170 --> 01:51:31,860
Can't be. This can't be.

1602
01:51:32,170 --> 01:51:33,860
Man, we can't afford that.

1603
01:51:35,420 --> 01:51:38,660
This is not possible here at all. That is not how it works.

1604
01:51:40,040 --> 01:51:42,000
Lord sacramento again.

1605
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:45,280
Geier! This can't go public!!!

1606
01:51:45,550 --> 01:51:47,280
Shit pile.

1607
01:51:55,910 --> 01:51:56,750
Idiot.

1608
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:09,330
What have you done now?

1609
01:52:09,910 --> 01:52:11,910
Pfander shot Brutus.

1610
01:52:13,020 --> 01:52:15,155
Geier and Richert are involved.

1611
01:52:15,280 --> 01:52:17,866
Yes, of course, Richert and Geier are also to blame.

1612
01:52:17,910 --> 01:52:23,022
Your problem is that you're constantly drunk.
It's always other peoples fault, right?

1613
01:52:23,150 --> 01:52:25,688
You are always the victim. The others are the bad guys.

1614
01:52:25,733 --> 01:52:29,333
Man, Geier banged Anja, that's why Brandt is now dead.

1615
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:32,260
Shut the fuck up. Leave Brandt out of the game.

1616
01:52:32,970 --> 01:52:34,260
Were you there?

1617
01:52:36,660 --> 01:52:38,530
Who do you want to believe? Them?

1618
01:52:39,150 --> 01:52:42,266
It doens´t matter who I believe. No one will believe you.

1619
01:52:42,750 --> 01:52:45,510
You are really a great Corps Brother, you know that.

1620
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:48,660
Not to mention what a body boy.

1621
01:52:49,640 --> 01:52:51,950
You'd better help me to report the two.

1622
01:52:55,730 --> 01:52:56,970
Did I warn you?

1623
01:52:57,860 --> 01:52:59,110
Yes I warned you

1624
01:52:59,110 --> 01:53:01,555
Yeah great, you were right again.

1625
01:53:01,688 --> 01:53:03,466
Are you proud of yourself now?

1626
01:53:04,440 --> 01:53:06,350
Okay, you have only one last chance.

1627
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:10,266
You call Pfander and try to explain everything to him.

1628
01:53:10,355 --> 01:53:13,511
But be careful man. You can't go against them.

1629
01:53:21,330 --> 01:53:24,577
David... What?... Wait, Pfander is here.

1630
01:53:24,930 --> 01:53:25,866
Yes and?

1631
01:53:26,440 --> 01:53:27,555
Pfander is here.

1632
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:29,550
Yes, and he said everything was okay.

1633
01:53:29,550 --> 01:53:31,550
Forget what he said.

1634
01:53:31,910 --> 01:53:35,600
Fact is that this guy doesn't attend the Corps Convention for pleasure.

1635
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:45,150
You have to help me.

1636
01:53:46,480 --> 01:53:50,840
Scharrenberg, you're a very nice guy.

1637
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:55,860
I really like you. But you have a problem.

1638
01:53:57,910 --> 01:54:02,040
In a desert could be one lonesome pitfall and you would fall for it.

1639
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:11,680
So, then we would have concluded point three of the agenda and...

1640
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:28,260
Sit down.

1641
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:35,510
Hereby we move on to point four off the agenda.

1642
01:54:35,730 --> 01:54:37,150
Various.

1643
01:54:37,330 --> 01:54:43,730
First, we have a criminal complaint from old honorably Member Pfander against Fox Scharrenberg.

1644
01:54:44,311 --> 01:54:46,310
If you please come forward Mr. Pfander.

1645
01:54:46,310 --> 01:54:48,130
Thank you Richert.

1646
01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:50,570
Fox Scharrenberg, please get up.

1647
01:54:53,200 --> 01:54:56,480
I hereby file a criminal complaint against Fox Scharrenberg.

1648
01:54:56,710 --> 01:54:59,066
Sir Fox von Scharrenberg, if I may please.

1649
01:55:01,280 --> 01:55:06,130
Against Sir Fox Von Scharrenberg, because he repeatedly attracted negative attention.

1650
01:55:06,620 --> 01:55:08,130
He's out of control.

1651
01:55:08,710 --> 01:55:13,860
He is dragging our colors in the dirt and behaved repeatedly non Corps Student wise.

1652
01:55:14,620 --> 01:55:18,930
This is not the first trial against Sir Fox Von Scharrenberg.

1653
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:22,260
What should I make of my Corps Brothers?

1654
01:55:22,570 --> 01:55:27,910
When one of our Foxes throws glasses at the wall and willfully destroys Corps Property.

1655
01:55:28,666 --> 01:55:33,111
Green virtues are celebrated in this house.
Shirts off Corps Brothers are torn a part.

1656
01:55:33,244 --> 01:55:35,510
Excessive and disgusting drinking.

1657
01:55:35,510 --> 01:55:36,970
Fist fighting.

1658
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:40,800
My God. We're not wild animals!

1659
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:42,530
We are Corps Students.

1660
01:55:43,640 --> 01:55:46,930
Furthermore, women have been harassed in a disgusting way.

1661
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:48,400
That's not true.

1662
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:50,840
Silencium Sir Fox Von Scharrenberg.

1663
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,040
Who allowed you to speak?

1664
01:55:55,150 --> 01:56:01,370
Are you denying that you approached my son's girlfriend inappropriately.

1665
01:56:02,040 --> 01:56:04,570
In a way that I don't want to repeat here.

1666
01:56:04,930 --> 01:56:10,840
I ask the Corps Convent here and now
whether we can and want tolerate such people in our ranks?

1667
01:56:13,330 --> 01:56:16,310
I mean what kind of upbringing did you enjoy?

1668
01:56:16,970 --> 01:56:18,840
What kind of family do you come from?

1669
01:56:20,080 --> 01:56:23,240
These are questions I ask myself when I look at your behavior.

1670
01:56:24,710 --> 01:56:26,620
Sir von Scharrenberg.

1671
01:56:27,730 --> 01:56:28,840
With or without Sir.

1672
01:56:29,110 --> 01:56:31,860
For sure you are definitely not a Corp Student.

1673
01:56:32,620 --> 01:56:36,355
There is no place in our ranks for people like you.

1674
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:42,080
So, Scharrenberg, would you like to comment?

1675
01:56:45,330 --> 01:56:46,220
So gentlemen.

1676
01:56:48,310 --> 01:56:51,240
It seems to me that I ...

1677
01:56:53,550 --> 01:57:00,350
...am played as a pawn sacrifice in this Corps Intrigue.

1678
01:57:03,240 --> 01:57:05,060
I just can't be bothered with this.

1679
01:57:07,460 --> 01:57:10,711
That my family is insulted here...

1680
01:57:11,020 --> 01:57:15,911
...makes it unbearable for me, and inevitably calls for satisfaction!

1681
01:57:41,330 --> 01:57:45,020
I hereby put down my ribbon.

1682
01:57:47,640 --> 01:57:54,130
I will keep my ribbon button, which my Mentor Jankwitz has given to me.

1683
01:58:01,330 --> 01:58:03,110
For your information.

1684
01:58:04,260 --> 01:58:09,640
My family has had Corps Students in all circles for generations.

1685
01:58:11,110 --> 01:58:13,330
Mainly in the white circle, of course.

1686
01:58:14,620 --> 01:58:20,530
My maternal ancestor was a founding father of your covenant in the year1820.

1687
01:58:21,110 --> 01:58:24,170
That is why I joined this inadequate covenant.

1688
01:58:26,040 --> 01:58:28,570
That's the only mistake I can blame myself for.

1689
01:58:31,510 --> 01:58:36,970
Mr. Pfander, I expect an apology from you!

1690
01:58:41,860 --> 01:58:48,088
As you choose to not apologize,
I hereby challenge you to a duell!

1691
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:50,620
The choice of weapons is yours.

1692
01:58:56,710 --> 01:58:59,155
You will hear from my second.

1693
01:59:02,440 --> 01:59:05,155
Good day gentlemen.

1694
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:28,970
Silencium, Silencium.

1695
01:59:30,710 --> 01:59:35,240
I hereby hand the floor to Mr. Pfander the third representative of the Corps Teutonia.

1696
01:59:37,020 --> 01:59:44,480
Dear representatives of the Seniors Convent.
I was given the great honor to be the voice of my ...

1697
01:59:46,260 --> 01:59:51,330
How can it be that someone is allowed to speak here who is not honoring satisfaction.

1698
01:59:52,080 --> 01:59:56,800
Silencium. Who are you that you are speaking here without being asked?

1699
01:59:57,200 --> 02:00:00,440
Scharrenberg the IV. Senior of the Corps Vandalia.

1700
02:00:03,460 --> 02:00:07,680
I take the liberty of speaking here because I consider it my duty ...

1701
02:00:08,310 --> 02:00:14,840
... to inform the council that the Pfander Family is not respecting the terms of an honor duell.

1702
02:00:14,977 --> 02:00:19,644
And that the council can't possibly tolerate letting such people of no honor speak for it.

1703
02:00:19,860 --> 02:00:21,110
How dare you?

1704
02:00:22,444 --> 02:00:24,044
That is an incredible insult.

1705
02:00:27,150 --> 02:00:29,680
Can you please substantiate your allegations.

1706
02:00:30,130 --> 02:00:31,111
With pleasure.

1707
02:00:31,550 --> 02:00:40,750
A year ago, I challenged Pfander the First to a personal contract over an honor dispute.

1708
02:00:41,600 --> 02:00:48,310
But instead of accepting the challenge, my letter came back with the note; "Address unknown"...

1709
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:55,600
There is no doubt that Pfander the First disgracefully pulled himself out of the affair.

1710
02:00:55,820 --> 02:00:58,710
I'm here today to sort it out once and for all.

1711
02:00:59,460 --> 02:01:04,800
So far that's true.
The requested person is apparently not present.

1712
02:01:06,660 --> 02:01:11,111
Then Mr. Pfander, are you going to comment on these allegations for your father?

1713
02:01:12,710 --> 02:01:15,680
Gentlemen, I would like your brief attention.

1714
02:01:15,860 --> 02:01:19,510
Admittedly, Teutonia was aware of this honor dispute.

1715
02:01:20,440 --> 02:01:28,660
But we negated it at the time, because it was with a former Fox off our Corps.

1716
02:01:29,200 --> 02:01:36,220
Besides according to our rules, non fraternity members are not allowed to challenge Corps Students.

1717
02:01:36,710 --> 02:01:38,170
So I would suggest...

1718
02:01:38,170 --> 02:01:40,310
I knew you wanted to talk your way out of it.

1719
02:01:41,150 --> 02:01:44,970
But according to Article 23 of the Kösener Statute, this is permissible.

1720
02:01:45,950 --> 02:01:47,200
I quote.

1721
02:01:47,420 --> 02:01:53,820
In honor disputes, non fraternity members, are authorized to challenge Corps Students...

1722
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:57,950
... if another fraternity grants them protection.

1723
02:01:58,710 --> 02:02:00,000
Quote end.

1724
02:02:00,350 --> 02:02:02,000
Can someone fact check this?

1725
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:07,550
High Council, Metzel, Corps Alemania, Chairman of the Black Circle.

1726
02:02:08,530 --> 02:02:10,080
If you allow?
I insist.

1727
02:02:14,933 --> 02:02:20,311
Indeed, according to Article 23, non fraternity students are allowed to challenge Corps Students.

1728
02:02:24,400 --> 02:02:27,422
Kröger Teutonia, representative of the Blue Circle.

1729
02:02:27,550 --> 02:02:31,866
Completely irrelevant.
The challenge was issued one year ago and has expired.

1730
02:02:31,955 --> 02:02:36,930
Did Mr. Scharrenberg apply for protection when he had the non fraternity student status?

1731
02:02:37,150 --> 02:02:42,755
Silencium, silencium, from now on there will be a list of speakers.
I will not tolerate any further heckling.

1732
02:02:42,840 --> 02:02:48,170
From now on, all heckling will be punished with a fine of 100 euros.

1733
02:02:48,755 --> 02:02:50,350
We can do well with the money.

1734
02:02:53,020 --> 02:03:01,600
Honorable Councillor, I hereby declare that I have granted
Mr. von Scharrenberg protection retrospectively for my covenant.

1735
02:03:02,040 --> 02:03:05,950
That is unheard of. That's not possible, Herr Metzel.

1736
02:03:05,950 --> 02:03:07,950
Silencium, silencium.

1737
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:11,770
Order, otherwise I'll have the room cleared here, yes.

1738
02:03:12,170 --> 02:03:15,600
So, first of all, a fine here for Mr. Richert.

1739
02:03:15,860 --> 02:03:21,860
So this is indeed an unusual case, for which, to my knowledge, there is no precedent case.

1740
02:03:21,950 --> 02:03:25,640
That's why I feel compelled to decide this case on an ad hoc basis.

1741
02:03:26,040 --> 02:03:33,280
For this reason we will vote on the admissibility of this honor dispute.

1742
02:03:34,130 --> 02:03:38,530
We are now voting according to circles. So now the vote.

1743
02:03:38,840 --> 02:03:40,311
Which circle votes for it?

1744
02:03:40,400 --> 02:03:42,080
The black circle votes for it.

1745
02:03:44,130 --> 02:03:46,800
The green circle votes yes.

1746
02:03:47,150 --> 02:03:49,460
All right and who is in dissent?

1747
02:03:49,680 --> 02:03:55,680
The Blue Circle votes against it and hereby protests against this attack-like vote.

1748
02:03:55,770 --> 02:03:57,822
Apply for a corresponding protocol note.

1749
02:03:57,860 --> 02:03:59,680
Yes, yes, everything is noted.

1750
02:04:00,310 --> 02:04:03,640
And how does the white circle decide?

1751
02:04:04,530 --> 02:04:07,420
Traditionally abstains from the vote.

1752
02:04:07,730 --> 02:04:09,911
It's unbelievable what's going on here.

1753
02:04:10,080 --> 02:04:13,110
Fine for the tall gentleman with his barrel hat.

1754
02:04:13,280 --> 02:04:16,840
Yes, so now order please. Silencium.

1755
02:04:17,150 --> 02:04:19,680
To me it now looks like we've found a vote.

1756
02:04:19,680 --> 02:04:24,260
Namely two votes in favor, one vote against and one abstention.

1757
02:04:24,260 --> 02:04:26,970
So for me this honor dispute is permissible.

1758
02:04:28,930 --> 02:04:34,750
So Mr. Pfander III, are you going to accept on behalf off your father?

1759
02:04:37,280 --> 02:04:38,800
I'm not trained at all.

1760
02:04:39,020 --> 02:04:40,930
But it shouldn't fail here.

1761
02:04:41,150 --> 02:04:43,730
That's enough, that's embarrassing!

1762
02:04:44,260 --> 02:04:48,622
I am providing goodwill and am accepting the challenge, so that it is clear!

1763
02:04:49,460 --> 02:04:51,910
Well then that would be clarified.

1764
02:04:52,355 --> 02:04:57,155
According to the rules, the challenged has the choice of the time, the place and the weapons.

1765
02:05:00,220 --> 02:05:03,644
Here and now. We fight with sabers.

1766
02:05:06,570 --> 02:05:09,022
Please what? With sabers?

1767
02:05:09,280 --> 02:05:11,020
Mr. Geier are you sure about that?

1768
02:05:11,510 --> 02:05:14,930
The last saber fight happened shortly before the second world war.

1769
02:05:15,020 --> 02:05:16,260
Saber!

1770
02:05:18,260 --> 02:05:23,730
Listen, Scharrenberg, a saber fight is different from a Mensur bout.

1771
02:05:23,730 --> 02:05:26,620
This is no longer fun, it is bitterly serious.

1772
02:05:27,822 --> 02:05:31,688
You can still think about it, you have achieved what you wanted.

1773
02:05:32,660 --> 02:05:34,660
I stand by my word.

1774
02:05:34,840 --> 02:05:37,288
It's an honour dispute, you do not quit.

1775
02:05:40,400 --> 02:05:45,150
Alright be careful, you don't have to prove anything to anyone.

1776
02:05:45,280 --> 02:05:48,044
Just see that you get out of the matter safely.

1777
02:05:53,060 --> 02:05:58,400
Keep calm and fight defensively. Anger makes you blind.

1778
02:05:58,660 --> 02:06:02,260
I am next to you and will protect you, understood?

1779
02:06:02,440 --> 02:06:07,420
Good. Now it’s about to begin.

1780
02:06:09,240 --> 02:06:11,460
Silencium.

1781
02:06:11,820 --> 02:06:19,460
I hereby open an honor dispute between Geier on my right side, Teutonia ...

1782
02:06:19,460 --> 02:06:25,240
... and Mr. von Scharrenberg the IV, Vandalia, on my left side.

1783
02:06:25,370 --> 02:06:27,860
The word is with the secondaries now.

1784
02:06:27,860 --> 02:06:29,860
Thank you high official.

1785
02:06:31,060 --> 02:06:35,680
I hereby announce a sabe rfight over 60 rounds each with 8 blows.

1786
02:06:36,440 --> 02:06:37,910
That´s all.

1787
02:06:39,600 --> 02:06:42,710
High official, Teutonia demands a break.

1788
02:06:43,510 --> 02:06:46,130
Break for Teutonia.

1789
02:06:46,880 --> 02:06:49,020
I ask you to consider the following.

1790
02:06:49,150 --> 02:06:51,422
Of course we're not going to back down.

1791
02:06:51,640 --> 02:06:54,170
As Teutons, we keep our word.

1792
02:06:54,480 --> 02:06:58,930
However, we are also committed to the Corps and other fencing fraternities.

1793
02:07:00,310 --> 02:07:02,620
Saber fights are prohibited by law.

1794
02:07:03,110 --> 02:07:08,400
If anyone dies in this saber fight, it would be an unparalleled scandal.

1795
02:07:09,200 --> 02:07:12,840
And it would be a disaster for the reputation of the Corps.

1796
02:07:13,420 --> 02:07:18,220
We should, yes we should find a face-saving solution.

1797
02:07:20,930 --> 02:07:22,310
I know what we are doing.

1798
02:07:24,440 --> 02:07:28,622
I'll negotiate with the other side that there will be only one honor round.

1799
02:07:28,930 --> 02:07:34,930
Thus the Fox has restored his honor and you faced the challenge.

1800
02:07:36,480 --> 02:07:39,460
That's the only solution for the Corps.

1801
02:07:47,370 --> 02:07:54,311
Mr. Richert, honorable Representative of Corps Teutonia,
may I draw your esteemed attention towards the violation off rules ...

1802
02:07:54,480 --> 02:07:58,710
...by contacting participants before such an honorary dispute.

1803
02:07:58,930 --> 02:08:10,622
My Corps has instructed me to inform you upon the fact
that our participant is constitutionally incapable of accepting the risk
of fatal injury during an honorary dispute.

1804
02:08:11,240 --> 02:08:13,200
So there is only one option.

1805
02:08:13,600 --> 02:08:16,080
There will only be an honorably round.

1806
02:08:16,400 --> 02:08:21,200
After that both parties discontinuate fighting.

1807
02:08:21,200 --> 02:08:28,570
As the honor dispute is not aware off any honorably round,
this arrangement will not be announced as such.

1808
02:08:29,770 --> 02:08:34,400
Mr. Metzel, Mr. Scharrenberg, are we in agreement?

1809
02:08:37,730 --> 02:08:39,420
Our side agrees.

1810
02:08:55,330 --> 02:08:58,480
Ok Geier, I'm sorry ...

1811
02:08:58,480 --> 02:09:02,530
... but the other side isn't willing to accept our offer.

1812
02:09:04,480 --> 02:09:06,400
I see only one option.

1813
02:09:06,570 --> 02:09:07,860
And what would that be?

1814
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:13,240
You have to stand one single exchange of blows.

1815
02:09:14,800 --> 02:09:17,550
After that our side aborts due to technical reasons.

1816
02:09:19,200 --> 02:09:20,220
Is it Agreed?

1817
02:09:20,530 --> 02:09:21,950
Agreed.

1818
02:09:26,880 --> 02:09:28,660
Bandaging pause finished.

1819
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:31,600
The word is now with the secondary.

1820
02:09:32,080 --> 02:09:35,420
The beginning and ending command will be on my side.

1821
02:09:42,080 --> 02:09:44,350
Silencium for such a honor dispute!

1822
02:09:52,400 --> 02:09:54,130
Stance.

1823
02:09:54,350 --> 02:09:55,240
Ready.

1824
02:10:10,080 --> 02:10:10,930
Go!

1825
02:10:12,170 --> 02:10:12,880
Halt.

1826
02:10:23,280 --> 02:10:24,040
Well

1827
02:10:24,970 --> 02:10:27,060
That's called a Kösener smile.

1828
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,933
If this story would be movie, I would have been purified ...

1829
02:10:31,730 --> 02:10:35,020
... would have left the Corps and that part of my life in the past.

1830
02:10:35,330 --> 02:10:38,880
Maybe I would have sold my story as a whistleblower to the press.

1831
02:10:39,820 --> 02:10:41,550
But what was the story all about?

1832
02:10:42,040 --> 02:10:46,930
Fencing fraternities are a normality in German-language countries.

1833
02:10:47,150 --> 02:10:53,820
A secret elite society pulling the strings in the background.
Nobody dares to speak about them.

1834
02:10:53,950 --> 02:10:58,350
We all know they exist. But who cares?

1835
02:10:58,350 --> 02:11:01,820
And what about me? I want to have a career.

1836
02:11:01,910 --> 02:11:06,170
My new Corps Brother offered me a job in a first class consultancy.

1837
02:11:06,170 --> 02:11:09,420
I did not say no to that offer. Would you?

1838
02:11:09,640 --> 02:11:11,420
But there remains one question.

1839
02:11:12,130 --> 02:11:14,800
What would you join?

1840
02:11:23,420 --> 02:11:26,400
You want to make a film about Corps Students, yes?

1841
02:11:27,680 --> 02:11:30,350
We go to the Pfälzer, there we get a beer. Frats.

1842
02:11:30,400 --> 02:11:32,080
You fill up immediately.

1843
02:11:32,080 --> 02:11:32,130
You are shit. You are a frat.
You fill up immediately.

1844
02:11:32,130 --> 02:11:34,440
You are shit. You are a frat.

1845
02:11:34,710 --> 02:11:37,370
What's happening here? Yes, would you please pan over.

1846
02:11:37,370 --> 02:11:39,370
Your reasons for beer are as follows.

1847
02:11:39,370 --> 02:11:45,280
Which would that be? One, two, three, four, six, seven

1848
02:12:00,660 --> 02:12:04,170
You don't think this is going to be boring.

1849
02:12:04,170 --> 02:12:09,280
There are a lot of people who find it really exciting.

1850
02:12:16,750 --> 02:12:18,710
Smashing Fox.

1851
02:12:20,930 --> 02:12:25,240
The whole thing's just a game.

1852
02:12:32,170 --> 02:12:35,330
There is full physical effort.

1853
02:12:35,330 --> 02:12:37,330
Torture yourself. Torture yourself.

1854
02:12:48,040 --> 02:12:50,260
We'll see each other again next semester.

1855
02:12:51,460 --> 02:12:53,422
With pleasure!
