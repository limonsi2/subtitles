3
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:59,277
- These doors offer a new start, Molly.

4
00:00:59,277 --> 00:01:01,069
From your first soldering iron,

5
00:01:01,069 --> 00:01:05,569
to your crypto-mining rig,
to your engineering degree,

6
00:01:07,689 --> 00:01:10,939
your whole life has led to this moment.

7
00:01:30,484 --> 00:01:32,845
- Why do you want to work
at Safeword Venture Capital?

8
00:01:32,845 --> 00:01:35,376
- I'm honored that you,
Bill the Billionaire,

9
00:01:35,376 --> 00:01:37,669
would even take the time to talk with me.

10
00:01:37,669 --> 00:01:39,957
I mean, I just recently graduated
from UC Berkeley, so the-

11
00:01:42,022 --> 00:01:43,439
Cardi B.

12
00:01:45,475 --> 00:01:48,103
- You're the top venture
capital firm in Silicon Valley.

13
00:01:48,103 --> 00:01:51,072
You just say Safeword,
and doors open for you.

14
00:01:51,072 --> 00:01:52,970
I mean, you're the lead
investor in Theranos,

15
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:54,665
Juicero, WeWork, all these-
- I know that.

16
00:01:54,665 --> 00:01:57,180
But why do you wanna work
here? Don't think, act.

17
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,821
- I'm-
- Wait!

18
00:01:58,821 --> 00:02:00,516
I'm so good at spotting talent.

19
00:02:03,938 --> 00:02:04,896
Have you been to Burning Man?

20
00:02:04,896 --> 00:02:06,995
- Burning Man? I don't
know why that's relevant.

21
00:02:06,995 --> 00:02:09,201
- Oh, tell me about your
experience at Burning Man.

22
00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:10,409
- Well, I've been twice.

23
00:02:10,409 --> 00:02:11,789
I really wanted to go again this year,

24
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:14,924
but I couldn't because of just life stuff.

25
00:02:14,924 --> 00:02:16,341
- Life stuff. Hm.

26
00:02:18,543 --> 00:02:19,995
Hey, what do you think of this?

27
00:02:19,995 --> 00:02:21,975
I had it commissioned when I was on keto.

28
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:25,147
I literally willed myself
into having a perm.

29
00:02:25,147 --> 00:02:26,362
What are your thoughts on mumble rap?

30
00:02:26,362 --> 00:02:27,401
- Mumble rap?

31
00:02:27,401 --> 00:02:28,444
You mean like Drake and Migos?

32
00:02:28,444 --> 00:02:29,909
- Yes, like Drake and, mm, Migo.

33
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:31,204
- I don't know why that's relevant

34
00:02:31,204 --> 00:02:32,667
to the role of junior associate.

35
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:34,456
- Oh, Molly, it is so relevant.

36
00:02:34,456 --> 00:02:35,737
- I like them.

37
00:02:35,737 --> 00:02:37,070
- Great. Me too.

38
00:02:39,995 --> 00:02:41,593
You're hashtag hired.
- What?

39
00:02:41,593 --> 00:02:43,440
- Job comes with the usual benefits:

40
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,179
free massages, private chef,

41
00:02:45,179 --> 00:02:47,559
oh, and we will pay off
all your student debt

42
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:49,479
once you reach 90 days at the firm.

43
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:52,418
Pack your bags. We are
headed to Burning Man.

44
00:02:52,418 --> 00:02:54,517
We need you to assess whether
or not we should invest

45
00:02:54,517 --> 00:02:56,092
in a self-driving car startup.

46
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:58,874
- A self-driving car startup?

47
00:02:58,874 --> 00:03:01,351
- Yeah, you can't commercialize a commune

48
00:03:01,351 --> 00:03:04,211
without some shiny new toys.

49
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:05,632
There's a young Zuckerberg-type there.

50
00:03:05,632 --> 00:03:07,322
We need to poach him before Elon.

51
00:03:07,322 --> 00:03:09,020
- Musk? Give me four hours.

52
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,014
- No, no, no. No, no.

53
00:03:10,014 --> 00:03:12,395
We have everything you need.

54
00:03:12,395 --> 00:03:14,878
A pinata full of party favors, drugs,

55
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:16,907
so much glitter, lots of leather,

56
00:03:16,907 --> 00:03:19,138
which was the favorite
of my last assistant.

57
00:03:19,138 --> 00:03:21,337
No need to pack. Be at
Moffett Field in two hours.

58
00:03:21,337 --> 00:03:22,876
- No, I can pack. I'll be ready.

59
00:03:22,876 --> 00:03:27,876
- No, no. Molly, my jet
will take us to Burning Man.

60
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:55,507
leave it all behind

61
00:03:55,507 --> 00:03:59,035
in ways never known

62
00:03:59,035 --> 00:04:04,035
where 70,000 call home

63
00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:11,370
fake white Buddhists

64
00:04:13,066 --> 00:04:15,546
got water for a week

65
00:04:38,675 --> 00:04:43,675
reached its peak in '09

66
00:04:46,567 --> 00:04:49,937
come to plug-in-play

67
00:05:06,394 --> 00:05:09,644
- Welcome home. Welcome to Burning Man.

68
00:05:17,311 --> 00:05:18,408
- Get the WiFi going.

69
00:05:18,408 --> 00:05:19,774
I want it up and running

70
00:05:19,774 --> 00:05:21,535
by the time I get back from the john.

71
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:26,085
I just did an 8 Ball and my
bobo is like .

72
00:05:26,085 --> 00:05:29,283
What up, playa, here comes a player!

73
00:05:29,283 --> 00:05:30,811
Sparkle!

74
00:05:31,687 --> 00:05:33,881
- No, not that one, not
that one. Post that one.

75
00:05:33,881 --> 00:05:35,964
- Oh, that one.
- Mm-hm, yeah.

76
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:30,195
autonomous, autonomous

77
00:06:30,195 --> 00:06:33,678
autonomous, autonomous

78
00:06:33,678 --> 00:06:38,199
autonomous, autonomous

79
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:43,960
revolutionary technology

80
00:06:47,502 --> 00:06:49,711
if you follow me

81
00:06:51,941 --> 00:06:53,905
you a moveable feast

82
00:06:55,591 --> 00:06:58,163
into hard-to-reach places

83
00:06:58,163 --> 00:07:00,564
into burning flames

84
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:08,671
the ride of your life

85
00:07:08,671 --> 00:07:11,011
transportation, automation

86
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:24,617
autonomous, autonomous

87
00:07:24,617 --> 00:07:28,533
autonomous, autonomous

88
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:32,487
autonomous, autonomous

89
00:07:55,905 --> 00:07:57,077
- Thank you.

90
00:07:58,113 --> 00:08:01,054
Oh, my god. My whole life
depends on having this running.

91
00:08:01,054 --> 00:08:02,522
- Your life? Come on.

92
00:08:02,522 --> 00:08:03,483
- This demo has to work.

93
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,843
I've been working on
this car since undergrad.

94
00:08:04,843 --> 00:08:08,319
I have a really important
presentation tonight.

95
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,079
I mean, Bill invented the hashtag.

96
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:14,314
- He didn't invent the
hashtag. It's the pound sign.

97
00:08:14,314 --> 00:08:16,579
- I'm sorry, who are you?

98
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,329
- Hi, I'm, uh, Molly.

99
00:08:20,677 --> 00:08:22,465
I'm Bill's newest associate.

100
00:08:22,465 --> 00:08:24,229
I just started today at
his venture capital firm,

101
00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:26,007
and I am already at Burning Man.

102
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:27,024
I've no idea how I got here.

103
00:08:27,024 --> 00:08:28,375
I thought I bombed that interview.

104
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:29,960
- Oh, hey, please don't
tell Bill anything.

105
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,479
This is basically a new problem.

106
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:33,458
And I have to get out of
the dorms at Stanford.

107
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:34,375
- Stanford?

108
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:39,026
Are you the software genius,
self-driving car creator Joe?

109
00:08:39,026 --> 00:08:40,426
Like, 30 under 30, TED Fellow,

110
00:08:40,426 --> 00:08:41,986
Fast Company's Most Creative?

111
00:08:41,986 --> 00:08:44,633
- I mean, I didn't do it by
myself. My fraternity helped me.

112
00:08:44,633 --> 00:08:46,133
- Ew. At Stanford?

113
00:08:48,273 --> 00:08:51,293
- Yeah, at Stanford. We build things.

114
00:08:51,293 --> 00:08:52,126
- I see.

115
00:08:53,183 --> 00:08:54,994
I was gonna tell you how
to fix your lidar system,

116
00:08:54,994 --> 00:08:58,577
but I know you already
know how to do that.

117
00:08:59,711 --> 00:09:03,879
- Well, I mean, you know,
just for conjecture.

118
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:05,194
- Molly!

119
00:09:05,194 --> 00:09:07,875
This sexy little Nikola Tesla nugget

120
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,171
only has hours to prepare his speech.

121
00:09:10,171 --> 00:09:12,161
Don't distract him. How's it going, Joe?

122
00:09:12,161 --> 00:09:13,440
- Oh-
- No pressure.

123
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,798
It's only gonna be me, you,

124
00:09:14,798 --> 00:09:16,820
and the biggest names in Silicon Valley

125
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,309
under the tent tonight.

126
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:22,668
Nail this, and I will
write you a blank check.

127
00:09:22,668 --> 00:09:25,876
Ooh, I wanna see a demo
now, Joe. But I can wait.

128
00:09:25,876 --> 00:09:28,561
Ooh, but I wanna see
it now. But I can wait.

129
00:09:28,561 --> 00:09:31,974
But if you wanna keep
tickling my balls, do it.

130
00:09:31,974 --> 00:09:33,476
- Uh, no.
- Tickle them, tickle them-

131
00:09:33,476 --> 00:09:35,494
- No thank you.
- Tickle them, tickle them.

132
00:09:35,494 --> 00:09:37,893
Ah, that's what I like
to hear, hashtag awesome!

133
00:09:37,893 --> 00:09:40,010
Remember, at Camp Safeword,

134
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:43,593
we don't just have tech
demos, we have fun.

135
00:09:45,445 --> 00:09:47,465
What do you do?

136
00:09:47,465 --> 00:09:48,635
Yoga? What is it?

137
00:09:48,635 --> 00:09:49,468
- I just...

138
00:09:49,468 --> 00:09:51,184
Nothing.
- Oh, yeah, you're a juicer.

139
00:09:51,184 --> 00:09:53,540
Speaking of which, our
drugs were confiscated.

140
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,082
Bureau of Land Management
is on high alert.

141
00:09:56,082 --> 00:09:58,100
They're stopping every hippie
bus from here to Gerlach.

142
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,980
I was promised Choco Tacos
and some goddamned molly!

143
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:01,991
- I'm right here.

144
00:10:01,991 --> 00:10:03,950
- No, I meant pure-grade MDMA...

145
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,590
Molls, could you get some of that?

146
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,555
- You're joking, there's-

147
00:10:06,555 --> 00:10:09,222
- Does it look like I'm joking?!

148
00:10:10,084 --> 00:10:11,224
We need these drugs

149
00:10:11,224 --> 00:10:14,119
or else tonight's soiree
is going to be a flop!

150
00:10:14,119 --> 00:10:16,406
Camp Safeword, which I
co-founded with Diddy,

151
00:10:16,406 --> 00:10:19,476
hosts the most exclusive
soiree at Burning Man.

152
00:10:19,476 --> 00:10:22,456
I can hold on the Choco
Tacos, but I need my drugs!

153
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:25,891
Why does everything
always happen to me?! Why?

154
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:27,058
Okay. Okay, B.

155
00:10:28,115 --> 00:10:29,875
Breathe, Bill.

156
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,292
Breathe. Breathe.

157
00:10:32,712 --> 00:10:35,274
Practice the mindfulness exercises

158
00:10:35,274 --> 00:10:37,042
you've been working on with Sandeep.

159
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:42,114
I'm the best, I'm the
best! I'm hashtag blessed!

160
00:10:42,114 --> 00:10:44,965
I'm the best, I'm the
best! I'm hashtag blessed!

161
00:10:44,965 --> 00:10:46,048
I'm the best.

162
00:10:47,219 --> 00:10:48,302
I'm the best.

163
00:10:50,909 --> 00:10:51,742
I'm back.

164
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:56,243
Get me pure-grade MDMA,
enough for the whole camp.

165
00:10:56,243 --> 00:10:59,796
And, Joe, remember, this is your moment.

166
00:10:59,796 --> 00:11:01,879
Hashtag don't fuck it up.

167
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:05,891
- Don't worry, I know how to fix

168
00:11:05,891 --> 00:11:07,153
your lidar mount using parts that I've-

169
00:11:07,153 --> 00:11:09,403
- Yeah, thanks, I got this.

170
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:12,752
- Mm.

171
00:11:17,027 --> 00:11:20,297
Listen, you got a free
ticket to Burning Man.

172
00:11:20,297 --> 00:11:22,938
Be a Sparkle Pony, sow your wild oats,

173
00:11:22,938 --> 00:11:24,265
milk a goat, I don't give a fuck.

174
00:11:24,265 --> 00:11:26,015
Just get me my drugs.

175
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,038
You know why you got the job?

176
00:11:30,038 --> 00:11:31,369
- Because of my degree from Berkeley

177
00:11:31,369 --> 00:11:33,750
and hardware engineering expertise.

178
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,798
- Sure, you can tell yourself that.

179
00:11:36,798 --> 00:11:38,728
I have great instincts.

180
00:11:38,728 --> 00:11:40,980
You know your way around here.

181
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,549
You know where to find the drugs.

182
00:11:43,549 --> 00:11:46,317
I checked out your Finsta.
Really interesting content.

183
00:11:46,317 --> 00:11:47,403
- You found my Finsta?

184
00:11:47,403 --> 00:11:50,189
- Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,
ooh, speaking of which,

185
00:11:50,189 --> 00:11:53,109
I thought of this outfit
for tonight's soiree.

186
00:11:53,109 --> 00:11:54,005
Really fits the theme.

187
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,499
It was supposed to be
for my last assistant,

188
00:11:56,499 --> 00:11:58,608
who walked out yesterday,

189
00:11:58,608 --> 00:12:01,608
but I think you can squeeze into it,

190
00:12:02,837 --> 00:12:04,837
and you will look great.

191
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:12,459
Now remember, there is
no "no" at Camp Safeword,

192
00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:17,459
and your bonus and loan
payments are at my discretion.

193
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,383
Mm?

194
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,633
Yeah. Mm.

195
00:12:25,926 --> 00:12:27,176
That's my girl.

196
00:12:29,836 --> 00:12:30,836
Bill is out.

197
00:12:37,788 --> 00:12:42,324
spark, spark, Sparkle Pony

198
00:12:42,324 --> 00:12:47,324
spark, spark, Sparkle Pony

199
00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:57,579
love My Little Pony

200
00:13:02,835 --> 00:13:07,631
from the default world

201
00:13:17,814 --> 00:13:21,834
actor in this play

202
00:13:33,425 --> 00:13:38,425
spark, spark, Sparkle Pony

203
00:13:38,836 --> 00:13:43,307
I'd look up to in life

204
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:51,917
wire in my dollhouse

205
00:13:51,917 --> 00:13:54,528
he'd be so bothered

206
00:13:54,528 --> 00:13:58,987
was really all about

207
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,800
out things with gear

208
00:14:19,076 --> 00:14:24,076
actor in this play

209
00:14:29,549 --> 00:14:34,549
spark, spark, Sparkle Pony

210
00:14:34,704 --> 00:14:39,704
spark, spark, Sparkle Pony

211
00:14:53,985 --> 00:14:56,762
- I'm sorry about before.

212
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:57,595
I just...

213
00:14:59,014 --> 00:15:00,347
Well, I'm sorry.

214
00:15:02,604 --> 00:15:03,746
Wow, he really gave you

215
00:15:03,746 --> 00:15:05,855
a leather Princess Leia
bikini for a work event.

216
00:15:05,855 --> 00:15:08,860
- It wouldn't be the most
revealing thing I've ever worn.

217
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,292
- It's inappropriate.

218
00:15:10,292 --> 00:15:11,125
- Yeah.

219
00:15:12,121 --> 00:15:13,088
- God!

220
00:15:13,088 --> 00:15:15,290
- Jesus! Didn't you cut the power?!

221
00:15:25,474 --> 00:15:30,141
Well, now it is the most
revealing thing I've ever worn.

222
00:15:34,307 --> 00:15:36,917
Is that a self-actualizing thing?

223
00:15:36,917 --> 00:15:38,084
I do that too.

224
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:46,792
That's not what I expected.

225
00:15:50,668 --> 00:15:53,877
pray to Steve Jobs.

226
00:15:53,877 --> 00:15:54,710
What?

227
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:59,710
Valley's against you

228
00:16:09,755 --> 00:16:14,755
rut in a technical review

229
00:16:25,241 --> 00:16:30,241
revolution is up to you

230
00:16:40,293 --> 00:16:42,104
He didn't have to deal
with sexual harassment.

231
00:16:42,104 --> 00:16:45,753
- Steven Jobs was his own boss,
he invented the Apple IIe,

232
00:16:45,753 --> 00:16:46,884
and he saved the rainforest.

233
00:16:46,884 --> 00:16:48,831
- He literally didn't.

234
00:16:48,831 --> 00:16:50,088
- We can get you drugs,

235
00:16:50,088 --> 00:16:51,651
and we can figure out
what's wrong with my car.

236
00:16:51,651 --> 00:16:53,572
- Your lidar rotational mount's burnt.

237
00:16:53,572 --> 00:16:55,192
You just need to find a replacement motor.

238
00:16:55,192 --> 00:16:57,942
But I know you already knew that.

239
00:16:59,615 --> 00:17:01,105
- Right.

240
00:17:01,105 --> 00:17:01,938
- Ahem.

241
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,478
- Oh, sorry.

242
00:17:04,478 --> 00:17:06,868
Okay, I'm ready. All right, go.

243
00:17:26,729 --> 00:17:30,533
that this world needs

244
00:17:30,533 --> 00:17:34,412
through technology

245
00:17:34,412 --> 00:17:38,283
that this world needs

246
00:17:38,283 --> 00:17:41,728
through technology

247
00:17:57,587 --> 00:17:58,420
- Okay.

248
00:18:02,442 --> 00:18:04,162
I'm guessing from your lack of goggles,

249
00:18:04,162 --> 00:18:05,764
this is your first Burn?

250
00:18:05,764 --> 00:18:06,597
- Yeah.

251
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:09,282
- Stick with me.

252
00:18:09,282 --> 00:18:12,351
The playa provides, but we're
gonna have to get creative

253
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,587
if we wanna meet this deadline,

254
00:18:13,587 --> 00:18:16,837
which means we'll have
to go to my first hookup.

255
00:18:16,837 --> 00:18:18,170
- These are fun.

256
00:18:21,553 --> 00:18:24,212
- Hey, bruh, we got the WiFi going.

257
00:18:24,212 --> 00:18:26,620
If you want to get the livestream going...

258
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,033
Yeah, all right.
- Party people,

259
00:18:28,033 --> 00:18:29,859
it's the place to be!

260
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,026
Welcome to Camp Polyamory!

261
00:19:21,629 --> 00:19:23,657
touching all my sherwani

262
00:20:13,806 --> 00:20:14,973
Uh, that's it.

263
00:20:22,042 --> 00:20:23,267
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

264
00:20:23,267 --> 00:20:24,100
I'm sorry.

265
00:20:25,574 --> 00:20:26,657
- Skirt-skit?

266
00:20:27,654 --> 00:20:29,130
Go over there and make us some drinks.

267
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,797
Yeah. Yeah.

268
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,595
- That's not the rotational
mount I had in mind.

269
00:20:38,595 --> 00:20:41,535
- Hey, Sparkle, welcome back.

270
00:20:41,535 --> 00:20:42,835
Long time.

271
00:20:42,835 --> 00:20:44,654
- I don't go by Sparkle Pony anymore.

272
00:20:44,654 --> 00:20:45,575
- Wait. You know this guy?

273
00:20:51,346 --> 00:20:54,150
Um, she's helping me with
my autonomous vehicle.

274
00:20:59,406 --> 00:21:01,492
- Who talks like that?

275
00:21:01,492 --> 00:21:05,018
- Everyone, Sparkle, get with the program.

276
00:21:05,018 --> 00:21:07,219
Chad, I need a favor.

277
00:21:07,219 --> 00:21:10,051
- What is it? Anything for you.

278
00:21:10,051 --> 00:21:12,081
- I need drugs.
- Drugs!

279
00:21:12,081 --> 00:21:14,648
- Okay. Some kinda sexual?

280
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:18,020
- Pure-grade MDMA or ecstasy.
- Do you have Percocet?

281
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,790
Molly, Percocet?

282
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:20,745
No.

283
00:21:20,745 --> 00:21:23,802
Okay, well, what are
you gonna give me in return?

284
00:21:23,802 --> 00:21:26,803
- That's not how Burning Man works.

285
00:21:26,803 --> 00:21:27,636
- Okay.

286
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:32,421
- The gifting economy runs freely

287
00:21:32,421 --> 00:21:34,879
when people give to each
other without money-

288
00:21:34,879 --> 00:21:36,699
- Okay.
- Without bartering.

289
00:21:36,699 --> 00:21:40,338
- Okay.

290
00:21:40,338 --> 00:21:43,020
- Do you have the MDMA or not?

291
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:43,853
- Um.

292
00:21:46,161 --> 00:21:47,117
Yeah, I do.

293
00:21:47,117 --> 00:21:48,105
- Great.

294
00:21:48,105 --> 00:21:51,574
- I was, like, starting to
feel it before you came.

295
00:21:51,574 --> 00:21:53,405
You said MDMA, right?

296
00:21:53,405 --> 00:21:54,262
- You put it in the...

297
00:21:54,262 --> 00:21:56,847
- Yeah. I made rolly margs!

298
00:21:56,847 --> 00:21:57,680
Here.

299
00:22:00,596 --> 00:22:02,431
It's for you.

300
00:22:02,431 --> 00:22:03,681
You want?
- I'm gonna go.

301
00:22:03,681 --> 00:22:04,597
- No, no, wait!

302
00:22:04,597 --> 00:22:06,318
There's gonna be party favors

303
00:22:06,318 --> 00:22:07,400
at this event I'm DJing tonight.

304
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,474
And Choco Tacos.

305
00:22:08,474 --> 00:22:10,891
I could probably, like, um...

306
00:22:12,095 --> 00:22:13,923
I could, like, probably get you in.

307
00:22:13,923 --> 00:22:15,752
- Bill's party?

308
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:18,169
- Yeah! Ah, that guy is dope!

309
00:22:20,488 --> 00:22:22,598
He's, like, on the board of Burning Man.

310
00:22:22,598 --> 00:22:23,735
The guy's a visionary.

311
00:22:23,735 --> 00:22:26,542
They're gonna have some
sorta investor meeting

312
00:22:26,542 --> 00:22:28,832
before the event tonight.

313
00:22:28,832 --> 00:22:31,915
Bill is going to automate Burning Man.

314
00:22:33,154 --> 00:22:36,987
And his Burn is gonna
be better than our Burn,

315
00:22:38,384 --> 00:22:43,236
just like how Disney World is
better than the real world.

316
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,966
- What?
- How do you know Bill?

317
00:22:48,966 --> 00:22:49,851
Did you get wristbands?

318
00:22:49,851 --> 00:22:51,100
- Wristbands?
- Yeah.

319
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,853
- He's my employer. I work for Safeword.

320
00:22:52,853 --> 00:22:55,122
- And I'm presenting my-
- Amaze-balls!

321
00:22:55,122 --> 00:22:58,205
What? I am so, like, so proud of you.

322
00:22:59,189 --> 00:23:02,078
This party's gonna be lit.

323
00:23:02,078 --> 00:23:06,039
And I'm gonna be live streaming
until the party gets rolly,

324
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:07,888
and then I'm gonna switch to my OnlyFans.

325
00:23:07,888 --> 00:23:09,321
- It's not that kinda party, Chad.

326
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:11,520
- We can connect, you
know, like old times.

327
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,853
I'm bringing Willow and Eve,

328
00:23:17,016 --> 00:23:18,736
and, like, Steve.

329
00:23:18,736 --> 00:23:19,569
- No.

330
00:23:24,728 --> 00:23:25,645
- You okay?

331
00:23:26,569 --> 00:23:29,625
- Yeah. It's kinda weird
seeing it from the other side.

332
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:32,426
Is this what
Burning Man's all about?

333
00:24:16,139 --> 00:24:17,345
- That yogi was gonna call me.

334
00:24:17,345 --> 00:24:19,652
- Molly, you camped with these people?

335
00:24:19,652 --> 00:24:21,556
- Let me explain.

336
00:24:23,864 --> 00:24:25,927
polyamory camp and met Chad

337
00:24:25,927 --> 00:24:27,680
filled me with his love

338
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,029
sharing, and I mean sharing

339
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:52,257
autonomous, autonomous

340
00:24:58,909 --> 00:25:03,909
consciousness, consciousness

341
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:06,650
- What's a shirt cocker?

342
00:25:09,414 --> 00:25:10,414
- Mm. There.

343
00:25:12,187 --> 00:25:14,007
- Oh. That's literal.

344
00:25:14,007 --> 00:25:15,090
Just a shirt.

345
00:25:16,317 --> 00:25:17,721
Oh, my god, that's huge.

346
00:25:17,721 --> 00:25:19,180
Oh, my god, that's so big!

347
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,339
Molly what is that?!

348
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:21,557
- It's a dust storm.

349
00:25:21,557 --> 00:25:24,489
Put your goggles on. We'll
take shelter in that yurt.

350
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:26,753
What's a yurt?!

351
00:25:26,753 --> 00:25:27,753
- Huh? Wait.

352
00:25:31,736 --> 00:25:32,569
Molly?!

353
00:25:52,111 --> 00:25:53,389
That was insane.

354
00:25:53,389 --> 00:25:55,120
This isn't Sunnyvale anymore.

355
00:25:57,193 --> 00:26:01,191
Is that a headless Barbie doll?

356
00:26:01,191 --> 00:26:03,160
- I don't care.

357
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,833
- Welcome home.

358
00:26:04,833 --> 00:26:07,692
take a load off.

359
00:26:07,692 --> 00:26:08,775
- Oh. Thanks.

360
00:26:09,815 --> 00:26:12,402
Could barely breathe out there.

361
00:26:12,402 --> 00:26:13,830
Oh, smells interesting in here.

362
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:17,977
- Mm. You two cool with
a gentle contact high?

363
00:26:17,977 --> 00:26:20,707
- I'm from Cali. I think I can hang.

364
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,043
Wow, cool vibes.

365
00:26:24,238 --> 00:26:27,988
This is what I used to
imagine Burning Man was like.

366
00:26:27,988 --> 00:26:29,346
How many Burns have you been to?

367
00:26:30,404 --> 00:26:33,690
- Well, they say, well-aged
and aged well, baby.

368
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:35,690
I was at the first Burn.

369
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:42,396
with Janis Joplin

370
00:26:43,006 --> 00:26:48,006
a girl with Kerouac

371
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:13,310
with the Grateful Dead

372
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:23,169
I nearly lost my head

373
00:27:24,412 --> 00:27:28,803
know what you're missing

374
00:27:33,743 --> 00:27:38,743
these new age hippies

375
00:27:39,235 --> 00:27:44,235
broths, and flying drones

376
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:49,719
spirit of Burning Man

377
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:59,606
just ain't the same

378
00:27:59,916 --> 00:28:04,916
and self-expression

379
00:28:05,296 --> 00:28:10,296
band together at all

380
00:28:21,227 --> 00:28:25,000
better the year before

381
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:40,296
year's Burn was better

382
00:29:05,347 --> 00:29:10,347
in a multi-colored bus

383
00:29:30,653 --> 00:29:35,653
into the next life

384
00:29:36,262 --> 00:29:41,262
this transformative change

385
00:29:42,609 --> 00:29:47,609
and radically participate

386
00:30:01,917 --> 00:30:06,917
without leaving a trace

387
00:30:17,831 --> 00:30:22,831
better the year before

388
00:30:34,412 --> 00:30:39,412
year's Burn was better

389
00:31:26,891 --> 00:31:28,182
Yes?

390
00:31:28,182 --> 00:31:29,157
- I'm confused.

391
00:31:29,157 --> 00:31:31,456
Nostalgia makes us remember
things as better in the past,

392
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:33,208
but technology is always improving.

393
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:36,180
- Mm, not necessarily true, my child.

394
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,193
I mean, I used to code on punch cards

395
00:31:38,193 --> 00:31:39,416
when I was starting out.

396
00:31:39,416 --> 00:31:40,962
- Exactly.
- But that meant we had

397
00:31:40,962 --> 00:31:43,764
to be exact and precise with our code,

398
00:31:43,764 --> 00:31:46,171
whereas nowadays any kid
can watch a YouTube video

399
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:48,186
and become a programmer.

400
00:31:48,186 --> 00:31:49,544
- You used to code?

401
00:31:49,544 --> 00:31:51,625
- I'd rather talk about human connection

402
00:31:51,625 --> 00:31:54,037
than Viewstamped Replication.

403
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,305
- Oh, you used to code, code.

404
00:31:56,305 --> 00:31:58,279
- Children, the song I
sang has history in it.

405
00:31:58,279 --> 00:32:02,241
But I, I wanna know about you two now.

406
00:32:02,241 --> 00:32:05,419
I feel like I've been waiting for you.

407
00:32:05,419 --> 00:32:06,768
- But you don't even know me.

408
00:32:06,768 --> 00:32:08,252
- Oh. Well, I can fix that.

409
00:32:08,252 --> 00:32:09,726
I'm Hazel.

410
00:32:09,726 --> 00:32:12,878
Out here, they call me Hazel the Hippie.

411
00:32:12,878 --> 00:32:15,211
Come on, sit down, children.

412
00:32:16,348 --> 00:32:18,161
- Oh. Hi, I'm Joe.

413
00:32:18,161 --> 00:32:19,919
Nice to meet you. But I
have to get back to camp.

414
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,361
- There's a dust storm.

415
00:32:22,361 --> 00:32:23,340
I'm Molly.

416
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,007
- Molly, pick three.

417
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,621
This won't take long.

418
00:32:29,621 --> 00:32:30,951
What's your sign?

419
00:32:30,951 --> 00:32:31,909
- Aquarius.

420
00:32:34,042 --> 00:32:35,863
- Free spirit, just like me.

421
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:41,166
All right, let's see what
the cards have to say.

422
00:32:41,166 --> 00:32:42,042
Hm.

423
00:32:44,858 --> 00:32:45,691
Ooh.

424
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:51,271
I see a domineering presence in your life

425
00:32:51,271 --> 00:32:52,920
that's keeping you from your potential.

426
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:57,770
- My ex, my father, my new
boss, the list goes on.

427
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:00,807
- You will rise up to take them down.

428
00:33:02,965 --> 00:33:04,820
Or at least one of them.

429
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,987
Sorry, it's a little hazy.

430
00:33:08,638 --> 00:33:11,126
You came here seeking something.

431
00:33:11,126 --> 00:33:13,055
- Yeah. Replacement parts.

432
00:33:13,055 --> 00:33:15,286
- And drugs. Pure-grade MDMA.

433
00:33:15,286 --> 00:33:17,452
There's this
invite-only soiree tonight,

434
00:33:17,452 --> 00:33:19,067
investor pitch thing.

435
00:33:19,067 --> 00:33:21,734
- I see. It's not Bill's, is it?

436
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,846
- Do the cards say that?

437
00:33:23,846 --> 00:33:27,679
- Nah, I got the Evite
weeks ago. Interesting.

438
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:30,358
Right.

439
00:33:30,358 --> 00:33:32,275
The sign of your rising

440
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:36,878
will be when the sheep baas three times.

441
00:33:36,878 --> 00:33:37,711
- Baas?

442
00:33:37,711 --> 00:33:40,982
- Cards say, "Sheep baas three times."

443
00:33:40,982 --> 00:33:42,860
Clairvoyancy works in mysterious ways.

444
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,863
Either you're born with it

445
00:33:43,863 --> 00:33:46,074
or, like me, you get
multiple online degrees

446
00:33:46,074 --> 00:33:47,559
in astrology to master it.

447
00:33:48,397 --> 00:33:49,654
Molly!

448
00:33:49,654 --> 00:33:51,841
- Chad, did you follow me here?

449
00:33:51,841 --> 00:33:53,463
- Yeah, I tried to,

450
00:33:53,463 --> 00:33:56,314
but there was a dust storm,
and I'm still rolling,

451
00:33:56,314 --> 00:33:57,919
and there was this shirt cocker.

452
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,351
- What do you want?

453
00:33:59,351 --> 00:34:01,377
- Well, I thought you were
coming to the cuddle puddle.

454
00:34:01,377 --> 00:34:03,315
I thought we really had
something special, you know?

455
00:34:03,315 --> 00:34:05,065
You, me, Willow, Eve-

456
00:34:06,324 --> 00:34:07,187
- Stop.

457
00:34:07,187 --> 00:34:10,019
- Hey, what about our poly contract, huh?

458
00:34:10,019 --> 00:34:10,900
They have contracts?

459
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,400
- Get everything in
writing in a joint venture.

460
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,379
- The contract is over.

461
00:34:15,379 --> 00:34:19,040
I want this experience to be
more than just drugs and tango.

462
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,882
- Fair point.

463
00:34:20,882 --> 00:34:21,840
Fair point.

464
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,650
But I thought you liked
the dom contract, you know?

465
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:26,163
You know I'd sub for you any day-

466
00:34:26,163 --> 00:34:27,525
- That was a phase.

467
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:30,442
I've grown. I won't say up but out.

468
00:34:32,505 --> 00:34:34,588
And maybe you should too.

469
00:34:35,595 --> 00:34:38,734
Come on, Joe, let's go find these drugs.

470
00:34:38,734 --> 00:34:40,768
It was really nice meeting you.

471
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,435
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

472
00:34:47,173 --> 00:34:51,006
Hoo, earth child, you
got a lot of work to do.

473
00:34:53,835 --> 00:34:58,335
- I really like Molly, and
Willow, and Eve, and Steve.

474
00:34:59,572 --> 00:35:01,338
- I can see that, baby.

475
00:35:01,338 --> 00:35:05,171
And it's okay. Hazel's
gonna take care of you.

476
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:09,645
You see, your self is like a labyrinth.

477
00:35:10,865 --> 00:35:14,962
You need to take off the
mask, journey inward,

478
00:35:14,962 --> 00:35:17,129
and shed your former self.

479
00:35:18,954 --> 00:35:20,586
- Are you trying to seduce me?

480
00:35:20,586 --> 00:35:22,001
- Hm?
- 'Cause Chad's down.

481
00:35:22,001 --> 00:35:22,911
- Wait, what?

482
00:35:22,911 --> 00:35:23,994
- Unpeel me, Hazel.

483
00:35:23,994 --> 00:35:25,899
- Ho! Wait, slow your roll, baby.

484
00:35:25,899 --> 00:35:26,732
Slow your roll.

485
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:31,811
Listen to me, when I ask you,

486
00:35:31,811 --> 00:35:34,394
"Who is Chad?" what do you say?

487
00:35:35,491 --> 00:35:38,940
- Um, well, I'm a
badass, former Vine star,

488
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,509
soon-to-be celebrity DJ

489
00:35:40,509 --> 00:35:42,943
with tens of thousands of
followers on social media.

490
00:35:42,943 --> 00:35:44,011
Church!
- No, no, no, no,

491
00:35:44,011 --> 00:35:44,878
no, no, no, no.

492
00:35:44,878 --> 00:35:48,338
Those are just labels
from the default world.

493
00:35:48,338 --> 00:35:51,421
I'm gonna ask you again, who is Chad?

494
00:35:53,676 --> 00:35:55,097
- Chadwick Edmund Wikowski?

495
00:35:55,097 --> 00:35:56,473
I don't know.
- All right, all right, baby.

496
00:35:56,473 --> 00:35:58,179
Come here, sit down. Come down here.

497
00:35:58,179 --> 00:35:59,292
Come down here.
- Okay.

498
00:35:59,292 --> 00:36:01,216
- Let's go. Unlock your chakras.

499
00:36:12,301 --> 00:36:15,051
- I love everyone and everything.

500
00:36:16,546 --> 00:36:20,802
And I just wanna spread
my love, like Prince.

501
00:36:20,802 --> 00:36:24,641
- Yes, yes, and the universe is ready

502
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:26,578
for you to spread your love.

503
00:36:26,578 --> 00:36:31,148
But first, you need to learn
to treat everyone as equals,

504
00:36:31,148 --> 00:36:33,065
starting with yourself.

505
00:36:35,637 --> 00:36:36,470
Okay.

506
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:39,335
I've learned a lot of life lessons

507
00:36:39,335 --> 00:36:41,835
by taking heavy hallucinogens.

508
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:45,732
I happen to have a special
tea that might help.

509
00:36:45,732 --> 00:36:46,974
- Oh, I keep it one hun.

510
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:49,810
- Yeah, I don't know what that means,

511
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:51,361
but I think it's a yes?

512
00:36:51,361 --> 00:36:52,327
- Oh, for sure, yeah.

513
00:36:52,327 --> 00:36:53,606
- Oh, okay.

514
00:37:01,531 --> 00:37:03,372
There's DMT in this cup.

515
00:37:03,372 --> 00:37:06,305
It's fast-acting, derived from ayahuasca.

516
00:37:06,305 --> 00:37:08,196
I brewed it from the
leaves of a caapi vine

517
00:37:08,196 --> 00:37:11,029
gifted to me by an Urarina shaman.

518
00:37:11,879 --> 00:37:13,617
It ain't your average tea.

519
00:37:13,617 --> 00:37:16,498
- I think I heard about this
on the Joe Rogan podcast.

520
00:37:16,498 --> 00:37:17,860
I think I'm in the right place to try it.

521
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,097
- Be sure.

522
00:37:19,097 --> 00:37:24,097
Once sipped, some don't go
back to their former selves.

523
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:26,857
I will watch over you, my child.

524
00:37:30,451 --> 00:37:32,618
- Oh, holy Hyphy Movement.

525
00:37:33,489 --> 00:37:34,579
Teach me, oracle.

526
00:37:34,579 --> 00:37:37,211
- You're here to teach yourself.

527
00:37:37,211 --> 00:37:39,501
Buckle up, baby, you are flying inward.

528
00:37:39,501 --> 00:37:42,501
Release your chi and drink your tea.

529
00:37:50,478 --> 00:37:51,478
- Ooh. Whoa.

530
00:40:43,564 --> 00:40:45,147
I'm tripping balls.

531
00:40:50,188 --> 00:40:51,099
- Surprising themed.

532
00:40:51,099 --> 00:40:51,932
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

533
00:40:51,932 --> 00:40:53,049
- It looks good on your face.

534
00:40:53,049 --> 00:40:56,082
- Ooh, unleash your spirit!

535
00:40:56,082 --> 00:40:58,689
Ooh, let your juices flow!

536
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:00,689
Unclench your sphincter!

537
00:41:02,758 --> 00:41:03,591
- Yeah, I don't think they'll have

538
00:41:03,591 --> 00:41:04,496
the motor we're looking for.

539
00:41:04,496 --> 00:41:06,036
- The drugs either.

540
00:41:06,036 --> 00:41:10,265
- Release those harmful
toxins, those chem trails,

541
00:41:10,265 --> 00:41:12,854
the fluorides poisoning our waters.

542
00:41:12,854 --> 00:41:13,839
Waters.

543
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:18,297
- Do you know what toxins
are being fed to the whales?

544
00:41:18,297 --> 00:41:20,508
- The whales.
- Release those harmful

545
00:41:20,508 --> 00:41:23,508
injections and let your juices flow.

546
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,348
Ooh.

547
00:41:26,348 --> 00:41:28,832
- Yo, bro! Stop by the
Spring Break Bro Camp!

548
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:31,411
We're doing Picklebacks to Nickelback!

549
00:41:31,411 --> 00:41:33,412
Spin the wheel, get spanked.

550
00:41:35,364 --> 00:41:38,254
Yes! That means you get spanked.

551
00:41:38,254 --> 00:41:39,087
Bend over.

552
00:41:39,087 --> 00:41:39,920
- What? All right.

553
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,260
Oh.

554
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,021
Oh, that was nice.

555
00:41:44,994 --> 00:41:46,107
- Hey, it's not Picklebacks.

556
00:41:46,107 --> 00:41:48,107
It's Fireball. Fireball!

557
00:41:51,057 --> 00:41:53,035
You know, it's half the
calories of a Jagerbomb.

558
00:41:53,035 --> 00:41:55,087
We're about radical self-expression here.

559
00:41:55,087 --> 00:41:56,008
- Then how come you all dress

560
00:41:56,008 --> 00:41:57,508
and look the same?

561
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:01,517
- Heh! Good one, bro.

562
00:42:01,517 --> 00:42:02,350
Now open up.

563
00:42:09,273 --> 00:42:11,039
- Oh, yeah, this is what
we drink at the frat.

564
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:13,650
- You're, what, like, 25,
and you still live on campus?

565
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:15,637
Uh, it's graduate
housing at Stanford.

566
00:42:15,637 --> 00:42:16,669
- Mm, at Stanford?

567
00:42:16,669 --> 00:42:18,552
- Yeah, at Stanford.
- Hey, I got a joke for you.

568
00:42:18,552 --> 00:42:21,993
How do you know that
someone went to Stanford?

569
00:42:21,993 --> 00:42:24,878
They tell you within the first
90 seconds of meeting them,

570
00:42:24,878 --> 00:42:26,220
which is literally what you told me

571
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,591
in the first 90 seconds of me meeting you,

572
00:42:28,591 --> 00:42:32,022
that you went to Stanford.

573
00:42:32,022 --> 00:42:33,685
Hi!

574
00:42:33,685 --> 00:42:37,227
- Hi. What brings you to
this side of the dusty playa?

575
00:42:37,227 --> 00:42:39,862
- I'm looking to score
some pure-grade MDMA.

576
00:42:39,862 --> 00:42:40,862
- Mm, mm-hm.

577
00:42:42,073 --> 00:42:44,156
Shrooms, uppers, downers,

578
00:42:46,482 --> 00:42:48,982
Special K, Children's Tylenol.

579
00:42:50,503 --> 00:42:53,048
Looks like our medicine
cabinet is all out of supplies.

580
00:42:53,048 --> 00:42:54,438
I'm gonna have to send you to Thunderhome.

581
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:56,215
- Oh, thank you.

582
00:42:56,215 --> 00:42:57,056
- If you're ever in
the neighborhood again,

583
00:42:57,056 --> 00:42:58,893
come by for a spanking.

584
00:42:58,893 --> 00:43:00,095
- Ooh.
- We will.

585
00:43:00,095 --> 00:43:00,928
Thanks.

586
00:43:02,648 --> 00:43:05,065
- Welcome to the Thunderhome!

587
00:43:07,154 --> 00:43:09,421
Two people may enter, one may win,

588
00:43:09,421 --> 00:43:12,010
unless, unless you have,
you know, like, four people,

589
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:13,623
and then as a tag team, that's two-on-two,

590
00:43:13,623 --> 00:43:15,035
so you have four people that enter,

591
00:43:15,035 --> 00:43:16,093
and then that means two may win.

592
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,923
But if you wanna add
one more person to that,

593
00:43:17,923 --> 00:43:19,517
so that means it's, like,
six people that enter,

594
00:43:19,517 --> 00:43:21,040
so that means it's a
three-on-three, right?

595
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,175
So that means six people enter,

596
00:43:22,175 --> 00:43:23,189
and then three people may win,

597
00:43:23,189 --> 00:43:26,340
but with that, with the three people,

598
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,297
that could be every man for himself,

599
00:43:28,297 --> 00:43:30,908
so essentially, one person is the winner.

600
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:32,799
Right. All right, look at the sign.

601
00:43:32,799 --> 00:43:35,216
Don't bitch. Have a good one.

602
00:43:38,677 --> 00:43:40,767
- Hazel, hi. What are you doing here?

603
00:43:40,767 --> 00:43:42,968
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

604
00:43:42,968 --> 00:43:44,426
This camp?

605
00:43:44,426 --> 00:43:47,926
This is about immediacy and participation.

606
00:43:50,231 --> 00:43:52,648
There are no spectators here.

607
00:43:53,871 --> 00:43:54,704
- Okay.

608
00:43:55,918 --> 00:43:56,751
Mm-hm.

609
00:43:57,688 --> 00:43:59,105
What's happening?

610
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:40,614
I don't know what just happened.

611
00:44:40,614 --> 00:44:42,669
- Hey, it turns out we have a hundred tabs

612
00:44:42,669 --> 00:44:44,345
of ecstasy in our camp.

613
00:44:44,345 --> 00:44:46,876
Take these. We're supposed
to be a clean and sober camp.

614
00:44:46,876 --> 00:44:47,709
- Thank you!

615
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:50,731
The playa provides.

616
00:44:50,731 --> 00:44:52,064
- Yeah. Come on.

617
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:57,252
Hazel, what is this?

618
00:44:57,252 --> 00:45:01,752
- This, oh, this is the heart
and soul of Burning Man.

619
00:45:04,145 --> 00:45:06,978
This coming together in community,

620
00:45:08,316 --> 00:45:09,743
each individual championing

621
00:45:09,743 --> 00:45:11,985
their own radical self-expression,

622
00:45:11,985 --> 00:45:14,839
while honoring the same in others.

623
00:45:15,672 --> 00:45:19,248
This, this Burning Man experiment,

624
00:45:19,248 --> 00:45:22,206
this is the human experience uncorked

625
00:45:22,206 --> 00:45:26,464
and poured out onto the desert
for one week every year.

626
00:45:26,464 --> 00:45:28,664
It's our greatest intention

627
00:45:28,664 --> 00:45:32,831
and our highest creative
expression made manifest.

628
00:46:02,246 --> 00:46:07,079
in embracing warmth

629
00:46:14,921 --> 00:46:19,921
brighter than everything

630
00:47:11,913 --> 00:47:13,692
I'm up here for Camp Safeword.

631
00:47:15,195 --> 00:47:17,128
- Fuck, fuck, fuck my fucking...

632
00:47:17,128 --> 00:47:19,211
Holy Ghost of Steve Jobs.

633
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,472
Molly, where've you been?
We've been looking for you.

634
00:47:23,472 --> 00:47:24,556
- Oh.

635
00:47:24,556 --> 00:47:27,889
- There's something different about you.

636
00:47:28,824 --> 00:47:30,974
I don't like it.

637
00:47:30,974 --> 00:47:32,057
Walk with me.

638
00:47:32,922 --> 00:47:36,472
Joe, let me give you a
little piece of advice.

639
00:47:36,472 --> 00:47:38,162
When I was a young man,
much like yourself,

640
00:47:38,162 --> 00:47:40,245
well, not quite like you,

641
00:47:41,655 --> 00:47:45,018
Steve Jobs cornered me in an elevator.

642
00:47:45,018 --> 00:47:48,057
He smelled of cedar and power,

643
00:47:48,057 --> 00:47:51,224
and he said, "Bill, don't fuck it up."

644
00:47:52,516 --> 00:47:56,175
That was the best career
advice I have ever received,

645
00:47:56,175 --> 00:47:58,745
and I'm passing it along to you,

646
00:47:58,745 --> 00:48:01,078
much like herpes but better.

647
00:48:02,436 --> 00:48:03,548
- It's okay, a lot of people have it-

648
00:48:03,548 --> 00:48:05,601
- Joe, go work on the tech demo.

649
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:09,493
Mm.

650
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:17,661
Molly, this is molly.

651
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:19,940
I asked you to get mushrooms!

652
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:21,963
I don't want my investors
humping each other,

653
00:48:21,963 --> 00:48:23,931
I want their minds blown by my speech!

654
00:48:23,931 --> 00:48:24,874
- You said ecstasy.

655
00:48:24,874 --> 00:48:27,166
- I didn't ask for molly, Molly.

656
00:48:27,166 --> 00:48:28,653
I have one of the great
memories of all time.

657
00:48:28,653 --> 00:48:29,740
Are you calling me a liar?

658
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,282
- No.

659
00:48:31,282 --> 00:48:34,143
- I ask you to do one
thing, go mushroom shopping,

660
00:48:34,143 --> 00:48:35,840
and you, you fuck it up.

661
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,703
Do you have any idea what
this makes me look like?

662
00:48:37,703 --> 00:48:39,644
I went to all this effort to create an-

663
00:48:39,644 --> 00:48:41,035
- In the spirit of Burning Man, like-

664
00:48:41,035 --> 00:48:42,646
- Don't interrupt me!

665
00:48:45,629 --> 00:48:47,962
"The spirit of Burning Man?"

666
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:51,766
This place is garbage!

667
00:48:51,766 --> 00:48:56,099
I mean, it is literally
surrounded by a trash fence!

668
00:48:57,358 --> 00:48:59,029
I got on the board to terraform this place

669
00:48:59,029 --> 00:49:01,220
into something valuable,

670
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:04,483
and not just porta potties
surrounded by stacks of sticks

671
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:07,650
and tents from Walmart,
and cuddle puddles,

672
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:10,067
and puppy piles, and furries,

673
00:49:10,909 --> 00:49:14,248
and some kinda weird
human centipede sex act,

674
00:49:14,248 --> 00:49:15,219
I still don't understand it,

675
00:49:15,219 --> 00:49:18,552
and this, what the fuckity fuck is this?

676
00:49:21,408 --> 00:49:25,235
Gee golly, Miss Molly
doesn't know the difference

677
00:49:25,235 --> 00:49:27,537
between pills and shrooms.

678
00:49:27,537 --> 00:49:31,036
I'm about to drop the
most earth-shattering talk

679
00:49:31,036 --> 00:49:33,286
on the motherfucking playa!

680
00:49:40,264 --> 00:49:42,984
what have you heard

681
00:49:42,984 --> 00:49:46,157
welcome to the new Burn

682
00:49:46,157 --> 00:49:49,226
down, burn and pillage

683
00:49:49,226 --> 00:49:52,777
b-b-b-Burning Village

684
00:50:05,122 --> 00:50:06,122
I'm amazing.

685
00:50:08,065 --> 00:50:10,004
Here's what we're gonna do.

686
00:50:10,004 --> 00:50:11,890
Investors will be here soon.

687
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:14,899
We'll put these into the
swag bags for the Gen Z-ers.

688
00:50:14,899 --> 00:50:17,205
They eat laundry pods for Christ's sakes,

689
00:50:17,205 --> 00:50:18,716
they won't even know what this is.

690
00:50:18,716 --> 00:50:19,895
- I don't think that that's a good idea.

691
00:50:19,895 --> 00:50:21,162
- Well, I'm not paying you to think,

692
00:50:21,162 --> 00:50:23,038
I am paying you for the leather bikini,

693
00:50:23,038 --> 00:50:25,958
which I don't see you wearing.

694
00:50:25,958 --> 00:50:28,066
- It's inappropriate.

695
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:30,033
I'm a junior associate at your firm.

696
00:50:30,033 --> 00:50:32,220
- "I'm a junior associate at your," okay?

697
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:33,194
- It's inappropriate.

698
00:50:33,194 --> 00:50:34,738
- Molly.
- And I'm not wearing it.

699
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:37,223
- Molly.

700
00:50:38,808 --> 00:50:41,058
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly.

701
00:50:44,449 --> 00:50:48,866
You pretend to be new at
this, but I know you're not.

702
00:50:50,926 --> 00:50:55,676
You are, oh, what's the word,
experienced at Burning Man.

703
00:50:57,201 --> 00:51:00,118
I know you've worn next to nothing.

704
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:04,191
I know you've done hardcore drugs.

705
00:51:06,027 --> 00:51:11,014
I know you've been part of
the poly camp with my DJ.

706
00:51:11,014 --> 00:51:12,705
This is not an outside ask.

707
00:51:12,705 --> 00:51:15,168
- How did you find that out?
- Safeword Venture Capital

708
00:51:15,168 --> 00:51:17,624
is the world-leading venture capital firm,

709
00:51:17,624 --> 00:51:19,974
investing in the tech
of the further future.

710
00:51:19,974 --> 00:51:21,054
- Doesn't make any sense.

711
00:51:21,054 --> 00:51:24,383
- We vet our hires through
every means possible

712
00:51:24,383 --> 00:51:27,505
to ensure the content of
their character reflects

713
00:51:27,505 --> 00:51:32,505
the ethics of our institution.

714
00:51:32,586 --> 00:51:33,419
Oh.

715
00:51:34,377 --> 00:51:35,210
Mm.

716
00:51:37,103 --> 00:51:38,969
Sweet cheeks.

717
00:51:38,969 --> 00:51:40,647
Get the leather on.

718
00:51:40,647 --> 00:51:41,777
Or you can be replaced like...

719
00:51:45,392 --> 00:51:49,142
Investors will be here
in 60, mm, 59 minutes.

720
00:51:52,462 --> 00:51:54,212
Remember, life stuff.

721
00:52:29,608 --> 00:52:34,608
this preposterous place

722
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:58,320
spark, spark, Sparkle Pony

723
00:53:06,639 --> 00:53:07,472
- Molly!

724
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:13,253
Molly! I'm looking for Molly!

725
00:53:13,253 --> 00:53:14,707
- I got molly.

726
00:53:14,707 --> 00:53:16,189
- What do you know about Molly?

727
00:53:16,189 --> 00:53:17,946
- Everybody know about molly.

728
00:53:17,946 --> 00:53:19,007
You're not a cop, are you?

729
00:53:19,007 --> 00:53:20,374
- I need Molly
- Ooh, cha!

730
00:53:20,374 --> 00:53:22,820
- Huh?
- You need an Ambien.

731
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:23,653
- No, oh,

732
00:53:23,653 --> 00:53:25,620
not that kinda molly.

733
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:26,652
Sparkle Pony.

734
00:53:26,652 --> 00:53:27,902
What?

735
00:53:30,434 --> 00:53:31,267
- Sparkle?

736
00:53:34,073 --> 00:53:36,026
Oh. Oh, are you in there?

737
00:53:36,026 --> 00:53:37,257
Go away, Chad.

738
00:53:37,257 --> 00:53:39,004
- Oh, I was just hoping
that we could talk.

739
00:53:39,004 --> 00:53:40,280
Can it wait until tomorrow?

740
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,370
- Well, I was really-
- Or never?

741
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:42,902
- Well, I was really hoping
that I could possibly-

742
00:53:42,902 --> 00:53:43,841
- What do you want, Chad?

743
00:53:43,841 --> 00:53:44,773
- Huh?
- Are you here to rub

744
00:53:44,773 --> 00:53:48,847
my choices in my face like everyone else?

745
00:53:48,847 --> 00:53:50,205
- You okay?

746
00:53:50,205 --> 00:53:51,808
- Yes.

747
00:53:51,808 --> 00:53:53,517
- You're lying.

748
00:53:53,517 --> 00:53:54,852
- Yeah.

749
00:53:54,852 --> 00:53:55,685
- Okay.

750
00:53:58,714 --> 00:54:00,556
Are you okay?
- Do I look okay?

751
00:54:00,556 --> 00:54:02,037
- Well, it's kinda...

752
00:54:02,037 --> 00:54:04,654
I can't really tell. It's,
like, super bright out here.

753
00:54:04,654 --> 00:54:07,457
- Wait, did you really just
ask me how I'm feeling?

754
00:54:07,457 --> 00:54:10,540
- Yeah. Seemed like you are not okay.

755
00:54:11,506 --> 00:54:13,056
Oh, is there anything I can do?

756
00:54:13,056 --> 00:54:14,292
- Okay, what is this really about?

757
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:15,125
- What? No, no, no.

758
00:54:15,125 --> 00:54:16,570
I just wanted to-
- Tango?

759
00:54:16,570 --> 00:54:19,363
- No, I'm actually looking
for an aux cable for my phone,

760
00:54:19,363 --> 00:54:21,788
for this thing I'm doing later.

761
00:54:21,788 --> 00:54:25,871
Anyway, I just wanted to
tell you that I'm sorry.

762
00:54:26,911 --> 00:54:31,911
Um, you know, I want all this
freedom to spread my love,

763
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:34,368
but I'm selfish with my love.

764
00:54:34,368 --> 00:54:37,394
And I'm seeing all these people.

765
00:54:37,394 --> 00:54:39,371
I'm with them, and I feel like

766
00:54:39,371 --> 00:54:43,389
I don't communicate
with any of them, so...

767
00:54:43,389 --> 00:54:45,472
And I feel different now.

768
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,151
Hazel really took off some layers.

769
00:54:49,151 --> 00:54:51,217
No, no, not like that. Ew, Molly.

770
00:54:51,217 --> 00:54:53,134
But she went inside me.

771
00:54:55,729 --> 00:54:57,644
And she took me to a place

772
00:54:57,644 --> 00:54:59,513
I haven't been in a really long time.

773
00:54:59,513 --> 00:55:04,169
And for a few hours, it seemed
like I was, like, a dolphin.

774
00:55:04,169 --> 00:55:06,473
It's a lot to unpack.

775
00:55:06,473 --> 00:55:11,473
But I just wanted to
say  I'm sorry.

776
00:55:12,044 --> 00:55:16,926
- I have spent my entire life
taking care of other people.

777
00:55:16,926 --> 00:55:18,410
Today, I've decided that I'm going

778
00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:21,592
to take care of myself first.

779
00:55:21,592 --> 00:55:23,090
- Oh, yeah.

780
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:25,148
- I support you, but that's some work

781
00:55:25,148 --> 00:55:26,418
you're gonna have to do on your own.

782
00:55:26,418 --> 00:55:27,751
Mm. Mm.

783
00:55:30,647 --> 00:55:32,351
- I gotta go to this party.
- No, no, yeah, you should go.

784
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:35,090
But I just really wanted to give you this.

785
00:55:35,090 --> 00:55:35,931
- Why?

786
00:55:35,931 --> 00:55:36,895
- What?
- Why?

787
00:55:36,895 --> 00:55:38,303
- Well, actually, it's like a symbol

788
00:55:38,303 --> 00:55:39,949
of how everything is so crazy here,

789
00:55:39,949 --> 00:55:41,372
but it can all come together and mesh.

790
00:55:41,372 --> 00:55:42,316
They blend together-

791
00:55:42,316 --> 00:55:43,353
- You're still coming down.
- Yeah, I know.

792
00:55:43,353 --> 00:55:44,631
I'm definitely still-
- It's fine, I'll take it.

793
00:55:44,631 --> 00:55:45,801
- I just want you to have it.
- Thank you.

794
00:55:45,801 --> 00:55:47,489
- Molly! Molly.

795
00:55:47,489 --> 00:55:49,406
- Molly?! I have molly!

796
00:55:53,319 --> 00:55:55,902
Geez. Okay, fuck your Burn too.

797
00:55:58,520 --> 00:55:59,353
- Molly, I need your help.

798
00:55:59,353 --> 00:56:00,219
I still have some pieces

799
00:56:00,219 --> 00:56:01,328
that I have to find for the lidar mount,

800
00:56:01,328 --> 00:56:02,907
and their thing is in, like, 30 minutes.

801
00:56:02,907 --> 00:56:06,321
- Ooh! I gotta get a plug for my thing.

802
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:09,238
No, not that kinda plug, but maybe.

803
00:56:10,915 --> 00:56:12,166
But also an aux cable.

804
00:56:17,009 --> 00:56:19,259
- Wait, Chad, your blender.

805
00:56:23,939 --> 00:56:25,939
Couldn't be that simple.

806
00:56:30,368 --> 00:56:31,785
The playa provides.

807
00:56:42,024 --> 00:56:45,580
pray to Steve Jobs

808
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:50,580
Valley's against you

809
00:56:59,092 --> 00:57:04,092
rut of a technical review

810
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:17,721
revolution is up to you

811
00:57:18,112 --> 00:57:22,971
would Steve, no, AOC do

812
00:57:22,971 --> 00:57:26,137
do, do, do, do do do

813
00:57:53,886 --> 00:57:57,330
that this world needs

814
00:57:57,330 --> 00:58:00,778
through technology

815
00:58:00,778 --> 00:58:04,147
that this world needs

816
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:07,217
through technology

817
00:58:14,178 --> 00:58:16,385
Oh! Ooh, the anti-collision system works.

818
00:58:16,385 --> 00:58:17,869
- Yeah, it could use some calibration.

819
00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:36,601
- What are the sheeple doing here?

820
00:58:36,601 --> 00:58:38,509
Baa, our sign will be

821
00:58:38,509 --> 00:58:41,882
when the sheep baas three times.

822
00:58:41,882 --> 00:58:43,915
- Hazel, what are you doing here?

823
00:58:43,915 --> 00:58:46,527
- Shepherding the flock, my star child.

824
00:58:46,527 --> 00:58:48,608
We're protesting your boss.

825
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:50,116
- Bill's investor party?

826
00:58:50,116 --> 00:58:53,074
- No, his Burning Village.

827
00:58:53,074 --> 00:58:56,074
Turns out, the federal government
is selling land out west,

828
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:59,546
and Bill is the highest
bidder for Black Rock Desert.

829
00:58:59,546 --> 00:59:02,217
I fear what will happen to
this place if he takes over.

830
00:59:02,217 --> 00:59:03,759
- What?
- You didn't know?

831
00:59:03,759 --> 00:59:05,224
- No.
- Bill's plans for

832
00:59:05,224 --> 00:59:07,388
"a tastefully curated living experience"

833
00:59:07,388 --> 00:59:10,126
will literally destroy
Burning Man as we know it.

834
00:59:10,126 --> 00:59:11,951
- The One Percent will fly
in on their private jets

835
00:59:11,951 --> 00:59:14,051
to experience this Burning Man Lite.

836
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:17,055
He'll raise ticket prices
to unsustainable levels,

837
00:59:17,055 --> 00:59:19,242
which is not what Burning
Man was founded on.

838
00:59:19,242 --> 00:59:20,183
- We have to do something.

839
00:59:20,183 --> 00:59:22,382
- His presentation starts any minute now!

840
00:59:22,382 --> 00:59:24,854
If he gets funded, we get punted!

841
00:59:24,854 --> 00:59:26,775
- Don't let Bill privatize the desert!

842
00:59:26,775 --> 00:59:29,135
Keep the Libertarians out of our utopia!

843
00:59:29,135 --> 00:59:30,926
- End unnecessary male circumcision!

844
00:59:30,926 --> 00:59:31,822
- No, baby, not that.

845
00:59:31,822 --> 00:59:34,423
- Yes, they're being sheeple, baby!

846
00:59:34,423 --> 00:59:36,130
It's culture jamming,

847
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:39,445
just like we used to do
with the Cacophony Society!

848
00:59:39,445 --> 00:59:40,415
- Baa!

849
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:41,998
Baa! Baa!

850
00:59:44,110 --> 00:59:47,422
- Joe, take the car! I have an idea.

851
00:59:47,422 --> 00:59:50,672
Hazel, I think I have something to say.

852
00:59:52,615 --> 00:59:55,556
- The playa provides, baby.

853
00:59:56,668 --> 00:59:59,370
- My fellow sheeple, right now,

854
00:59:59,370 --> 01:00:01,645
influencers and tech CEOs are deciding

855
01:00:01,645 --> 01:00:03,602
the fate of this place.

856
01:00:03,602 --> 01:00:06,614
We are fighting for our
right to be who we are

857
01:00:06,614 --> 01:00:09,124
in a world that doesn't
think that we belong.

858
01:00:09,124 --> 01:00:10,943
- Baa!
- We are here to save

859
01:00:10,943 --> 01:00:13,911
the playa before they fleece us out

860
01:00:13,911 --> 01:00:15,291
of the place that what we love!

861
01:00:15,291 --> 01:00:17,676
- You better believe!
- We are not gonna baa

862
01:00:17,676 --> 01:00:20,119
into the good night and
have our dreams deferred

863
01:00:20,119 --> 01:00:23,087
by culture vultures
stealing what we create!

864
01:00:23,087 --> 01:00:25,946
They have already gentrified
my hometown of Oakland,

865
01:00:25,946 --> 01:00:27,666
but I gotta draw the line somewhere.

866
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:30,276
And for me, today, that line is here,

867
01:00:30,276 --> 01:00:32,359
so who's coming with me?!

868
01:00:38,089 --> 01:00:40,339
And there will be drugs and booze there!

869
01:00:51,357 --> 01:00:52,274
- Yes, man.

870
01:01:07,374 --> 01:01:08,451
- Hey. Hey.

871
01:01:08,451 --> 01:01:09,587
The fuck are you doing?

872
01:01:09,587 --> 01:01:11,071
This is the third time
you've played that song.

873
01:01:11,071 --> 01:01:13,378
- Oh, little JoJo Siwa wants
me to play it over and over

874
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:15,197
till she gets the timing
right for her TikTok.

875
01:01:15,197 --> 01:01:16,659
- No, that's good. Keep doing that.

876
01:01:16,659 --> 01:01:17,492
- Yeah.

877
01:01:18,776 --> 01:01:20,933
It's weird seeing this
from the other side.

878
01:01:20,933 --> 01:01:23,636
- Hey, I don't know what your problem is,

879
01:01:23,636 --> 01:01:26,744
but you need to stop fucking
me and start fucking yourself.

880
01:01:26,744 --> 01:01:29,245
I am paying you in massive exposure.

881
01:01:29,245 --> 01:01:30,935
Now, I'm about to make my entrance,

882
01:01:30,935 --> 01:01:33,352
drop that motherfucking bass.

883
01:01:39,486 --> 01:01:41,153
- Hey, party people!

884
01:01:42,346 --> 01:01:44,581
Are y'all ready right meow?!

885
01:01:44,581 --> 01:01:48,996
I'm about to drop this bass
like a self-exploratory trip

886
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:52,788
that makes you question the societal norms

887
01:01:52,788 --> 01:01:55,017
you've been saddled with
your whole lives, okay?!

888
01:01:55,017 --> 01:01:57,918
So dance, but have a good time!

889
01:01:57,918 --> 01:01:59,328
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

890
01:01:59,328 --> 01:02:00,911
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

891
01:02:01,823 --> 01:02:02,823
BillConnect!

892
01:02:03,937 --> 01:02:04,770
Whazzup?!

893
01:02:06,870 --> 01:02:09,120
We are changing the future!

894
01:02:11,053 --> 01:02:12,960
Everybody, property developers,

895
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,047
developers, developers, developers,

896
01:02:15,047 --> 01:02:16,683
developers, developers!
- Developers, developers.

897
01:02:16,683 --> 01:02:17,516
- Ah.

898
01:02:20,156 --> 01:02:23,525
Hey. Hey, I see you, Gwyneth Paltrow.

899
01:02:23,525 --> 01:02:26,570
I got your candle. Really
does smell like, mm-hm.

900
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:29,096
And, Oprah?! You get a yurt!

901
01:02:29,096 --> 01:02:30,949
And you get a yurt! And you get a yurt!

902
01:02:30,949 --> 01:02:35,203
Oh, is that Ja Rule?! Hey,
hey, loved your festival.

903
01:02:35,203 --> 01:02:37,573
Totally believable...

904
01:02:37,573 --> 01:02:39,484
Tiger King.

905
01:02:39,484 --> 01:02:41,411
You're still relevant?

906
01:02:41,411 --> 01:02:42,244
That doesn't matter.

907
01:02:42,244 --> 01:02:44,721
Thanks so much for coming to the soiree!

908
01:02:44,721 --> 01:02:47,260
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm so high,

909
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:49,593
hey, welcome to BillConnect,

910
01:02:50,651 --> 01:02:53,734
or, or b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-BillCON!

911
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:02,300
You know me, self-made billionaire,

912
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:05,967
tech investor, entrepreneur,
playboy, zaddy.

913
01:03:09,613 --> 01:03:12,863
Yes, Billionaire is my legal last name.

914
01:03:17,603 --> 01:03:20,352
Tonight is not about me, no!

915
01:03:20,352 --> 01:03:21,688
No. No, no, no, no.

916
01:03:21,688 --> 01:03:24,447
Tonight is about the
future, future, future,

917
01:03:24,447 --> 01:03:27,239
future, future, future, future.

918
01:03:27,239 --> 01:03:30,022
We're taking the best
parts of Burning Man,

919
01:03:30,022 --> 01:03:32,605
and curating them just for you,

920
01:03:34,228 --> 01:03:39,214
without all the hippies,
and furries, and moopers.

921
01:03:39,214 --> 01:03:40,907
We will use automation

922
01:03:40,907 --> 01:03:43,662
to create the tax-free Libertarian utopia

923
01:03:43,662 --> 01:03:45,912
we've all been dreaming of.

924
01:03:48,202 --> 01:03:50,112
We can recruit the top programmers

925
01:03:50,112 --> 01:03:52,413
in the world and fly them here.

926
01:03:52,413 --> 01:03:54,413
They can build and create,

927
01:03:54,413 --> 01:03:59,413
unfettered by laws and pesky
regulations and, mm, ethics.

928
01:03:59,652 --> 01:04:02,485
Let us open a free trade of ideas,

929
01:04:03,648 --> 01:04:06,239
and create the automated
city of the future

930
01:04:06,239 --> 01:04:08,968
that I'm calling, wait for it,

931
01:04:08,968 --> 01:04:11,635
b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-Burning Village!

932
01:04:45,427 --> 01:04:48,578
to its rightful owners

933
01:04:48,578 --> 01:04:53,411
b-b-b-bitch, move over

934
01:05:01,262 --> 01:05:04,220
And for tonight's keynote address,

935
01:05:04,220 --> 01:05:06,960
we wanna introduce a
bright, supple, young mind

936
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:10,691
that we here at Safeword are
hoping to get into bed with,

937
01:05:10,691 --> 01:05:11,781
and not just missionary.

938
01:05:11,781 --> 01:05:15,282
We want all the kinks. We love his ideas!

939
01:05:15,282 --> 01:05:19,654
We wanna get inside him,
and we hope you will too.

940
01:05:19,654 --> 01:05:22,904
Allow me to introduce Joe and his aCar!

941
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:37,474
- Ahem.

942
01:05:38,490 --> 01:05:39,323
Ahem.

943
01:05:44,143 --> 01:05:46,404
They say the wheel can't be reinvented,

944
01:05:46,404 --> 01:05:48,425
but I would argue against it.

945
01:05:48,425 --> 01:05:50,045
Um, I'm offering a revolutionary

946
01:05:50,045 --> 01:05:50,878
technology that's-
- Yes.

947
01:05:50,878 --> 01:05:53,693
That's so revolutionary. It's amazing.

948
01:05:53,693 --> 01:05:55,729
All right, here you go, champ. Keep going.

949
01:05:55,729 --> 01:05:56,924
Eye on the prize. Come on.

950
01:05:56,924 --> 01:05:57,757
- What?

951
01:05:59,165 --> 01:06:02,248
Um, or how about the aCar to cut jobs

952
01:06:04,225 --> 01:06:07,316
and modernize your
shipping infrastructure,

953
01:06:07,316 --> 01:06:10,149
um, stop jobs from going overseas,

954
01:06:11,613 --> 01:06:13,696
compete with the Chinese?

955
01:06:15,350 --> 01:06:18,200
Um, I've got a revolutionary technology

956
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:20,024
that's better than them all combined.

957
01:06:20,024 --> 01:06:23,544
Um, we can revolutionize, mobilize,

958
01:06:23,544 --> 01:06:25,711
and privatize Burning Man.

959
01:06:28,144 --> 01:06:32,227
And these hippies stans
will never see it coming.

960
01:06:34,338 --> 01:06:36,956
Um, think outside the road

961
01:06:36,956 --> 01:06:38,823
and get ready for the ride of your life.

962
01:06:38,823 --> 01:06:41,636
We've reinvented
transportation, automation,

963
01:06:41,636 --> 01:06:46,053
intelli-humanoidal collaboration,
and I'm calling it,

964
01:06:49,903 --> 01:06:51,320
I'm calling it...

965
01:06:55,133 --> 01:06:57,466
I'm not calling it anything.

966
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:00,433
I can't do this.

967
01:07:05,728 --> 01:07:06,811
Sorry. Sorry.

968
01:07:08,752 --> 01:07:09,835
Um, fuck you.

969
01:07:10,718 --> 01:07:11,551
- Yeah, fuck...

970
01:07:11,551 --> 01:07:15,541
Fuck me? Joe, what do
you think you're doing?

971
01:07:15,541 --> 01:07:17,012
- Look, I built this car to help people,

972
01:07:17,012 --> 01:07:19,291
not for rich people to joyride in.

973
01:07:19,291 --> 01:07:21,349
I know I came here to pitch my tech,

974
01:07:21,349 --> 01:07:26,259
but I didn't build this car
for you, I built it for them!

975
01:07:26,259 --> 01:07:29,420
No, not them. Like, they're outside.

976
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:31,228
I know I'm supposed to say
something really profound here,

977
01:07:31,228 --> 01:07:34,108
but I'm still processing it.

978
01:07:34,108 --> 01:07:34,999
Molly, do you-

979
01:07:34,999 --> 01:07:36,995
- I sure can. Baa!

980
01:07:36,995 --> 01:07:38,779
- Baa!
- Oh, god, what is this,

981
01:07:38,779 --> 01:07:40,842
a flash mob?!

982
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:47,955
- Silence!

983
01:07:47,955 --> 01:07:49,618
- These Burners are expressing

984
01:07:49,618 --> 01:07:52,611
their civic responsibility
and participation,

985
01:07:52,611 --> 01:07:54,741
key principles of Burning
Man that you've thrown

986
01:07:54,741 --> 01:07:57,129
under the bus with your Burning Village.

987
01:07:57,129 --> 01:07:57,962
- No, no, no, no, no.

988
01:07:57,962 --> 01:08:00,188
This woman is pulling
the wool over your eyes.

989
01:08:00,188 --> 01:08:01,359
- That's not funny, that's wack.

990
01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:03,284
- Molly, you got me the wrong drugs,

991
01:08:03,284 --> 01:08:05,382
you started this crappy dinner theater,

992
01:08:05,382 --> 01:08:07,484
and you're still not in your bikini.

993
01:08:07,484 --> 01:08:08,451
- It burned.

994
01:08:08,451 --> 01:08:10,017
- Yes! Free the nipple!

995
01:08:10,017 --> 01:08:11,006
That is not what I meant.

996
01:08:11,006 --> 01:08:11,935
Well, then what you meant.

997
01:08:11,935 --> 01:08:16,435
- Okay. Bill, your toxic
masculinity is exhausting me.

998
01:08:17,368 --> 01:08:20,587
Get a coloring book and a therapist, okay?

999
01:08:20,587 --> 01:08:23,638
Burning Man is not a
playground for the One Percent!

1000
01:08:23,638 --> 01:08:26,877
- Take that shit to Coachella.

1001
01:08:26,877 --> 01:08:27,728
Do you have any idea of what

1002
01:08:27,728 --> 01:08:29,988
you're making me look like?

1003
01:08:29,988 --> 01:08:32,141
Yourself.

1004
01:08:32,141 --> 01:08:33,633
- I'm warning you, I will-
- If you wanna fire me,

1005
01:08:33,633 --> 01:08:34,746
go ahead.

1006
01:08:34,746 --> 01:08:36,028
What happens in the default world

1007
01:08:36,028 --> 01:08:38,535
has no effect on me here on the playa.

1008
01:08:38,535 --> 01:08:41,613
I'm home. I've found my strength here.

1009
01:08:41,613 --> 01:08:43,321
I'm confident.

1010
01:08:43,321 --> 01:08:44,617
I am here now.

1011
01:08:52,213 --> 01:08:54,813
out things with gears

1012
01:09:07,255 --> 01:09:12,255
the actor in this play

1013
01:09:53,503 --> 01:09:56,662
- Yeah, the kids are here now, William.

1014
01:09:56,662 --> 01:09:59,151
Oh, and the new age is leaving you behind.

1015
01:09:59,151 --> 01:10:00,791
- I don't know where you get off, Hazel.

1016
01:10:00,791 --> 01:10:02,105
You're part of the One Percent!

1017
01:10:02,105 --> 01:10:03,836
- What?

1018
01:10:03,836 --> 01:10:04,753
- Oh, Bill.

1019
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:08,903
Yes, it's true, children.

1020
01:10:08,903 --> 01:10:11,192
Out here, I'm known as Hazel the Hippie,

1021
01:10:11,192 --> 01:10:15,650
but in the default world, I
go by Shirley Booth Werner.

1022
01:10:16,939 --> 01:10:19,395
The inventor
of the clamshell laptop.

1023
01:10:19,395 --> 01:10:22,829
- Now, I may be wealthy
in the default world,

1024
01:10:22,829 --> 01:10:27,162
but I live the principles
of Burning Man year-round.

1025
01:10:28,176 --> 01:10:30,120
I'm an angel investor.

1026
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:32,502
I fund small startups and nonprofits

1027
01:10:32,502 --> 01:10:36,321
that work to improve the human experience.

1028
01:10:36,321 --> 01:10:40,404
the
minute you get out of

1029
01:10:40,404 --> 01:10:44,385
any kind of contract with
this bozo, you give me a call.

1030
01:10:44,385 --> 01:10:47,145
Yes, tech goddess.
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

1031
01:10:47,145 --> 01:10:51,125
BillConnect is my party;
this will be my desert!

1032
01:10:51,125 --> 01:10:53,616
- Bill, you cannot
throw an exclusive party

1033
01:10:53,616 --> 01:10:56,318
when Burning Man is
about radical inclusion.

1034
01:10:56,318 --> 01:10:58,469
- Can't you see that I'm the victim here?

1035
01:10:58,469 --> 01:11:00,486
No one in history has been treated-

1036
01:11:02,654 --> 01:11:03,805
I'm the best, I'm the best!

1037
01:11:03,805 --> 01:11:06,707
I'm hashtag blessed!
- Oh, that's enough, Bill!

1038
01:11:06,707 --> 01:11:09,466
I mean, I was a dolphin a couple hours ago

1039
01:11:09,466 --> 01:11:14,455
and I think we all agree
with Hazel, you're a clown.

1040
01:11:22,187 --> 01:11:23,020
- Good one, Bill.

1041
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:24,564
- Okay.
- Excellent.

1042
01:11:24,564 --> 01:11:26,403
- Chad, drop the bass.

1043
01:11:26,403 --> 01:11:29,251
And let's turn this into a dance party!

1044
01:11:31,732 --> 01:11:33,361
- Yes!

1045
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:37,847
Hey, you're a real leader.

1046
01:11:39,779 --> 01:11:43,497
I think I can see a
place for you in my firm.

1047
01:11:43,497 --> 01:11:46,365
- I really appreciate
the work that you do,

1048
01:11:46,365 --> 01:11:48,516
but out here on the playa,

1049
01:11:48,516 --> 01:11:50,614
I'm free and I do not
wanna talk about business.

1050
01:11:50,614 --> 01:11:52,000
- I gotcha.

1051
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,850
- But let's have coffee, and not tea,

1052
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:56,963
in the real world.

1053
01:11:56,963 --> 01:11:58,986
- That sounds good to me, Molly.

1054
01:11:58,986 --> 01:12:01,826
- You can call me Sparkle. Sparkle Pony.

1055
01:12:01,826 --> 01:12:03,694
- Ooh, all right, Sparkle Pony.

1056
01:12:03,694 --> 01:12:07,141
- Let's do it.
- Let's walk this way.

1057
01:12:40,827 --> 01:12:45,827
better than the year before

1058
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:52,321
better than the year before

1059
01:12:58,806 --> 01:13:02,132
autonomous, autonomous

1060
01:13:02,132 --> 01:13:04,650
autonomous, autonomous

1061
01:13:06,222 --> 01:13:11,222
really made a spark

1062
01:13:18,743 --> 01:13:23,743
but came out on top

1063
01:13:32,930 --> 01:13:37,930
than the year before

1064
01:13:39,344 --> 01:13:44,344
than the year before

1065
01:13:50,344 --> 01:13:53,582
autonomous, autonomous

1066
01:15:28,423 --> 01:15:30,682
- Oh, I'm still going?

1067
01:15:30,682 --> 01:15:31,581
Yeah.

1068
01:15:33,676 --> 01:15:36,096
Drink your tea.

1069
01:15:36,096 --> 01:15:37,513
- Down the hatch.

1070
01:15:43,463 --> 01:15:44,900
So hot.

1071
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:49,416
- That's it.

1072
01:15:49,416 --> 01:15:50,557
Just a little bit more.

1073
01:15:50,557 --> 01:15:51,392
- It's so horrible.

1074
01:15:51,392 --> 01:15:53,096
Oh, is it? It's all right.

1075
01:15:53,096 --> 01:15:54,075
It'll be worth it in the end,

1076
01:15:54,075 --> 01:15:54,910
I promise.
- And it tastes terrible.

1077
01:15:54,910 --> 01:15:55,843
- It's all right.

1078
01:15:55,843 --> 01:15:56,839
Oh, get-
- Okay.

1079
01:15:56,839 --> 01:15:58,427
Here we go.
- Get...

1080
01:15:58,427 --> 01:15:59,688
- Down the hatch.
- Oh.

1081
01:15:59,688 --> 01:16:01,021
- Last bit.
- Mm.

1082
01:16:02,167 --> 01:16:03,167
- There's actually still more.

1083
01:16:03,167 --> 01:16:04,611
- Okay.
- Okay, here we go.

1084
01:16:06,376 --> 01:16:07,219
It's a deep cup.

1085
01:16:07,219 --> 01:16:08,824
Okay, I could
pour less next time.

1086
01:16:08,824 --> 01:16:11,157
- No, no.
- That's all right.

1087
01:16:15,123 --> 01:16:17,450
Oh, I'm tripping balls.

1088
01:16:17,450 --> 01:16:18,850
- Fuck you.

1089
01:16:18,850 --> 01:16:20,522
Fuck me?

1090
01:16:20,522 --> 01:16:23,007
What do you think you're doing, Joe?

1091
01:16:23,007 --> 01:16:24,634
- I-
- Say it.

1092
01:16:24,634 --> 01:16:27,200
No, say it.
- I hate you so much.

1093
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:28,935
- Why?
- 'Cause you remind me-

1094
01:16:28,935 --> 01:16:30,492
- Of your father.
- Of my father.

1095
01:16:33,789 --> 01:16:34,622
Huh?
- Bend over.

1096
01:16:34,622 --> 01:16:36,070
- Oh, I broke your fan.

1097
01:16:36,070 --> 01:16:38,160
But that felt good.

1098
01:16:40,267 --> 01:16:41,600
- Good one, bro.

1099
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:44,803
That means you get spanked!

1100
01:16:44,803 --> 01:16:46,061
Bend over.

1101
01:16:46,061 --> 01:16:47,556
- Oh.

1102
01:16:48,910 --> 01:16:49,835
Well...

1103
01:16:49,835 --> 01:16:52,023
- Jagerbomb.

1104
01:16:52,023 --> 01:16:54,330
We're all about radical
self-expression here.

1105
01:16:54,330 --> 01:16:56,858
Yes! That means you get spanked.

1106
01:16:56,858 --> 01:16:57,691
Bend over.

1107
01:17:02,297 --> 01:17:03,334
Yes!

1108
01:17:03,334 --> 01:17:05,262
- It's all right. There's another one.

1109
01:17:07,348 --> 01:17:08,860
- Michael!
- Sorry, guys.

1110
01:17:08,860 --> 01:17:10,927
I'm really not winning today.

1111
01:17:10,927 --> 01:17:15,376
do, do, do, do do do

1112
01:17:15,376 --> 01:17:16,459
- Turn it on.

1113
01:17:26,819 --> 01:17:27,729
Beautiful.

1114
01:17:41,850 --> 01:17:45,261
that this world needs

1115
01:17:45,261 --> 01:17:48,680
through technology

1116
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:52,166
that this world needs

1117
01:17:52,166 --> 01:17:55,148
through technology

1118
01:18:11,666 --> 01:18:12,499
Beautiful.

1119
01:18:14,742 --> 01:18:15,959
Now, I've sat here and listened

1120
01:18:15,959 --> 01:18:17,399
to this entire thing,

1121
01:18:17,399 --> 01:18:19,999
and a couple hours ago, I was a dolphin,

1122
01:18:19,999 --> 01:18:22,828
but I can still tell that
I think you are a very mean

1123
01:18:22,828 --> 01:18:24,828
or rude and ugly person.

1124
01:18:28,786 --> 01:18:30,036
- I'm not ugly.

1125
01:18:32,714 --> 01:18:35,846
I think there is
a place for you in my firm.

1126
01:18:35,846 --> 01:18:38,483
I really appreciate
the work that you do,

1127
01:18:38,483 --> 01:18:40,754
but I am free on the playa,

1128
01:18:40,754 --> 01:18:42,469
and I do not wanna talk about business.

1129
01:18:42,469 --> 01:18:43,351
- Gotcha.
- Me?

1130
01:18:43,351 --> 01:18:45,270
Hey, Joe, what do you think you're doing?

1131
01:18:45,270 --> 01:18:47,458
- Oh, I'm not doing the speech.

1132
01:18:47,458 --> 01:18:49,658
I think I'm gonna go to, I don't know,

1133
01:18:49,658 --> 01:18:50,815
massage therapy school or something.

1134
01:18:50,815 --> 01:18:52,768
There's one in Costa Rica.
It's, like, really good.

1135
01:18:52,768 --> 01:18:53,756
- Why would you go to Costa Rica?

1136
01:18:53,756 --> 01:18:54,652
- Bye.

1137
01:18:54,652 --> 01:18:56,400
Joe, what do you
think you're doing here?

1138
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,840
- Well, I built this car for poor people.

1139
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:00,196
I built this car for poor people.

1140
01:19:01,044 --> 01:19:03,813
What do you think you're doing?

1141
01:19:03,813 --> 01:19:06,483
- I don't wanna do this anymore.

1142
01:19:06,483 --> 01:19:08,159
- And Steve.

1143
01:19:08,159 --> 01:19:08,992
- No.

1144
01:19:15,988 --> 01:19:18,338
- Okay, I'm leaving, but on my own accord.

1145
01:19:18,338 --> 01:19:23,108
I'm choosing to go. You
cannot kick me out of BillCON.

1146
01:19:23,108 --> 01:19:24,529
I invented the hashtag.

1147
01:19:24,529 --> 01:19:26,178
- Bill, bye.

1148
01:19:26,178 --> 01:19:27,011
Bye-bye.

1149
01:19:28,105 --> 01:19:28,938
Bye-bye.

1150
01:19:31,137 --> 01:19:31,970
Goodbye.
