{\an8}EVERYONE ON SET TESTED NEGATIVE
FOR COVID-19

4
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:22,756
{\an8}ALL PREVENTIVE MEASURES WERE TAKEN

00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:26,760
<i>LEE SU-GEUN, THE SENSE COACH</i>

7
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:33,433
I've never felt this way before.

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,702
{\an8}Let's go. The Sense Coach.

9
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,729
{\an8}LEE SU-GEUN

10
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:11,805
Gosh.

11
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:14,140
I heard this spot was quiet.

12
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:16,242
I didn't expect to hear applause.

13
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:18,311
I guess it's not so quiet here, after all.

14
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:20,280
Let's see.

15
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,348
The water looks clean.

16
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,085
The fish aren't bad either.

17
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:26,986
But they're not moving very much.

18
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:30,757
They're all fixed in place.
Is it because the weather is still cold?

19
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:33,760
What have I got here?
I heard fish go nuts over these.

20
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:36,496
I'm sure this will do. Look at this.

21
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:39,566
I paid 680,000 won for this.

22
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:42,068
All right. Let's see what will nibble.

23
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:45,105
There's one. It seems interested.
Yes, come on.

24
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:46,506
It's reacting to the bait.

25
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:49,476
It's nibbling at it.

26
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:51,211
Gosh. This is it.

27
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,545
Hold on.

28
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,714
Yes! Come on!

29
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,084
It took the bait! It took it!

30
00:01:58,151 --> 00:01:59,719
Darn, it stole my bait.

31
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,756
I can't believe he took off
with just the bait.

32
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:06,092
I'm sure he knows he has to return it.

33
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:08,761
All right. Let's see here.

34
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:11,865
What have I caught today? I caught a lot.

35
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:14,000
This one's still alive. What is this?

36
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:17,203
A sea bass. My goodness.

37
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,539
It's still alive. Unbelievable.

38
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,442
I caught a shark in fresh water?

39
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:25,044
A halibut, a salmon, a sea bass…

40
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:26,813
What's this? What the heck?

41
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,382
I even caught some English letters.

42
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:32,285
Look at this. A Super Junior.

43
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:33,620
It's a Super Junior member.

44
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,723
You like this kind of joke?
What's this, then?

45
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,627
I've never caught
anything like this before. What is this?

46
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:43,029
Do I just put it on like this?

47
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:47,901
Testing.

48
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,443

When I say, "sense," you say, "coach."

73
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,126
-Sense!
-Coach!

74
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,061
Despite the pandemic,

75
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,565
NongMill Kim came
all the way here to help me.

76
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,734
He even got tested for COVID-19.

77
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,702
My nose hurt like crazy.

78
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,571
Please give it up for him.

79
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:34,274
-Thank you. This has been NongMill Kim.
-NongMill Kim!

80
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,409
You'll soon be performing all over Europe.

00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:37,744
Netflix, just you wait!

82
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,880
People from 190 countries
are watching you right now.

83
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,649
A lot of people are watching this.

84
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:45,051
Anyway, it's time to get started.

85
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,988
Welcome to <i>Lee Su-geun, the Sense Coach</i>.

86
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:51,257

{\an8}TRANSFORMING INTO THE SENSE COACH

88
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:02,135
{\an8}IS ANYONE CLUELESS ENOUGH
TO NOT BE CLAPPING RIGHT NOW?

89
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:14,414
Hello. Welcome, everyone.

90
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,815
-Hello.
-Hello.

91
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:18,718
All right. I'm Lee Su-geun.

92
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:24,490
The global company, Netflix, told me
that they have some money to spend.

93
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:27,327
That's why I dressed up like this.

94
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:29,762
I'm wearing a gold tracksuit.

95
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,464
It's 18K gold.

96
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,766
Check out this necklace.

97
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,802
What does it say? I think it's rented.

98
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:37,036
Whatever.

99
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:40,406
Also, I'm wearing a gold whistle
since I'm a coach.

100
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,242
Nice. Isn't it great?

101
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:45,478
Anyway… What's this? Take this away.

102
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,815
Take this away already.
Where are your senses?

103
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:52,018
Take it. How could you forget?

104
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,020
What are you doing?

105
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,891
Who are you?

106
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,993
-Goodness.
-Who are you?

107
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,729
-It's Park Sung-kwang.
-Hello.

108
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:04,931
{\an8}PARK SUNG-KWANG

109
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:08,901
I'm flexing my crew.

110
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:11,671
-There's a celebrity in the crew.
-Hold on.

111
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,606
Why are you wearing a mic?

112
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:16,743
-I thought I was doing this with you.
-I was surprised to see you.

113
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:21,247
-You were?
-But when you tripped for no reason,

114
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:22,782
I knew you were a comedian.

115
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,250
I was told to take the bucket,

116
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,819
-but as a comedian, I had to do something.
-Good job.

117
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:30,289
The next comedy show should be yours.

118
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:31,324
-Me?
-Yes.

119
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,761
Then the viewers would think
all Korean comedians are short.

120
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:37,130
-You and I are both short.
-Then…

121
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:40,166
Someone tall should do it before me.

122
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,868
Then it's not stand-up comedy.

123
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:44,003
-It's sit-down comedy.
-Exactly.

124
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,472
What's the point? It makes no difference.

125
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:48,307
Right. It would be sit-down comedy.

126
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:50,610
Anyway, thank you so much.

127
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:52,311
-Thank you, Sung-kwang.
-Thank you.

128
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:54,347
-Enjoy the show!
-All right.

129
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,115
-See you.
-Okay.

130
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,918
Take the bucket and cap with you.

131
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:02,388
How is this different from <i>Gag Concert</i>?

132
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,557
-Sorry.
-Europeans will be shocked.

133
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,492
-I'm sorry.
-This is stand-up comedy.

134
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,995
-It should be high-quality.
-Yes, stand-up comedy.

135
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,430
-You can leave now.
-Okay.

136
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:12,098
-Sit back and enjoy.
-I will.

137
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:15,001
Thank you so much,
NongMill and Sung-kwang.

138
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:19,338
Stand-up comedy shows
usually have a bigger audience.

139
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:22,575
You all even got tested for COVID-19
to come and see me.

140
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,510
-Aren't your seats comfortable?
-Yes.

141
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:26,446
Then I guess you won't be laughing a lot.

142
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,116
I'm on many TV shows these days.

143
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,551
I took up fishing recently.

144
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:35,221
I first learned to fish on the show,
<i>The Fishermen and the City</i>.

145
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,089
Fishing skills aren't anything special.

146
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:38,791
You just need to have a feel for it.

147
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:40,059
When a fish is nibbling,

148
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,128
just notice it and reel it in.

149
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:45,298
If Kyung-kyu yells at you
for catching all the fish yourself,

150
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:46,466
just stop catching them.

151
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,067
Then he stops complaining.

152
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,470
He becomes quiet again.
You have to take a hint.

153
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:53,172
{\an8}There is a type of fish
called the barbel steed.

154
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:56,509
{\an8}Do you know it? Its name sounds
just like the Korean word for "sense."

155
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,045
{\an8}You can see it on the screen. Cool, right?

156
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:00,780
Only our show can do this.

157
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,114
It looks like this.

158
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:03,950
It's actually a dialectal variant.

159
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,852
It's often caught in fresh water,

160
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,353
and it's pretty strong.

161
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,122
This fish just refuses to take a hint.

162
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:14,393
It has a lot of bones
and a really strong fishy smell.

163
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,829
Once you touch it,
your hands smell fishy for days.

164
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,232
So when people catch it, they swear at it,

165
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,133
making it feel uncomfortable.

166
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,869
Instead of moving its mouth,

167
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:24,837
it glances at you.

168
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:25,872
That's what it does.

169
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,740
The reason I brought this up

170
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,142
is because this fish is just like me.

171
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,345
Not that I have many bones,

172
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:34,714
smell a lot, or am unpopular.

173
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,616
I'm over 40 now,

174
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:40,453
and for most of my life,
I've walked on eggshells around people.

175
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,256
Do you know who makes me
walk on eggshells the most?

176
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:44,590
-Kang Ho-dong.
-Kang Ho-dong.

177
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,393
You guys answered right away.

178
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:50,029
Everybody seems to know.

179
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:51,097
It's Kang Ho-dong.

180
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,166
While I'm a mere barbel steed,

181
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:58,371
he is an intimidating amberjack
that's longer than one meter.

182
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:00,206
It's massive.

183
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,375
When you try to reel in this fish,

184
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:04,877
it feels like it yells at you.
"Let me go!"

185
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:07,613
You can almost hear that. It's that big.

186
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,984
Recently, I caught an amberjack
that was longer than a meter.

187
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,320
It was huge. That's what I caught.

188
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,822
It was on the Christmas special episode.

189
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,325
Reeling it in was really exhausting.

190
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,694
Ho-dong is the amberjack of variety shows.

191
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,930
Not just a regular amberjack,

192
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:25,831
but a deadly one.

193
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,402
His power and strength are no joke.

194
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:31,771
I first met him on the show,
<i>2 Days & 1 Night</i>.

195
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:33,372
-Two Days!
-One Night!

196
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:36,842
You're supposed to say, "Two Days."

197
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:40,012
Everyone will know
this was shot in Korea now.

198
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:43,149
As you all know,

199
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:46,085
everyone on the show was amazing
and they all achieved stardom.

200
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:49,088
We camped a lot in <i>2 Days & 1 Night</i>.

201
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,257
We basically camped all the time.

202
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:54,260
In the end, I got so tired of it
and wanted to try something new.

203
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,162
So I tried suspending all my activities.

204
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,764
I thought that'd be better.

205
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:01,334
Sung-kwang, you're clapping.

206
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,835
That's why I left the show.

207
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:05,104
At first,

208
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,772
it was really hard.

209
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,209
{\an8}On <i>Gag Concert</i>,
everything was already planned.

210
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,245
{\an8}But on a variety show,
I had no idea what to do.

211
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:14,614
During the shoot,

212
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,983
I couldn't even look at the camera.

213
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,385
I stared at the amberjack the whole time.

214
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,654
I kept glancing at Ho-dong

215
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,289
because I had no idea what to do.

216
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:25,791
I decided,
"I'll only do what I'm told to do.

217
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:27,393
I won't try too hard to be funny.

218
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,961
I'll just do my job.

219
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:30,463
I can do this."

220
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:33,165
One day, the amberjack, Ho-dong,

221
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:36,335
complimented me for the first time.

222
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:37,737
For my driving skills.

223
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:39,905
Some of you probably know.

224
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:43,242
"I didn't even notice you brake.
How did the car stop?

225
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,711
We just turned left,
but I didn't feel a thing.

226
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:48,147
How did we arrive
in Gangwon Province so fast?"

227
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,282
My work vehicle at the time

228
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,785
was a Carnival,
like many other celebrities.

229
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,854
The minivan that's very festive.

230
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,522
I changed cars about six times.

231
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:59,225
They would install cameras in my van

232
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,260
using a lot of duct tape.

233
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,463
These days, they use better equipment.

234
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,099
Back then, they used duct tape
for everything.

235
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,069
And duct tape is impossible
to remove completely.

236
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:11,904
Once, I dozed off in my van.

237
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:15,107
When I woke up and tried to get out,

238
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:18,344
my arm wouldn't move because
it was stuck to the duct tape residue.

239
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,746
Duct tape can even make

240
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:24,984
an unhappy couple
stick together all the time.

241
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,186
Duct tape really is amazing.

242
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:28,954
Since I'm only human,

243
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,923
I get tired if I drive a lot.

244
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,159
One day, I'd been driving for many hours.

245
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:34,827
But the others in the van…

246
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:37,596
What's the point of having cameras?
No one talked to me.

247
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:40,566
They were all fast asleep
with their mouths open.

248
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:43,669
Eun Ji-won was banging his head
on the window repeatedly,

249
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:44,870
but he wouldn't wake up.

250
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:47,506
Ho-dong's snores were deafening.

251
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:49,575
I was angry. No one said a word to me.

252
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:53,746
"Do they think of me as their driver?
What's my role in this team?"

253
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:55,981
The scenery is magnificent
along the Dong River.

254
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:59,652
But you need to drive carefully,
or else you might fall off the cliff.

255
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,088
I thought, "Should I drive off the cliff?

256
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:04,390
Then I could become the main host.

257
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:08,060
I'll cast my six favorite people
and take over <i>2 Days & 1 Night</i>."

258
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:09,695
While I was thinking that,

259
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:11,130
I noticed Seung-gi

260
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:12,898
in the back seat.

261
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,102
He was sleeping like an angel,

262
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:18,437
not making a single sound.

263
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:21,207
I couldn't bring myself to do that
for his sake.

264
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:24,310
One more thing. I looked at Ho-dong.

265
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:27,813
Even if we fell off the cliff,
his head is basically a helmet.

266
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,648
So if he survived,

267
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:32,251
you can guess what would've happened.

268
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:35,888
I would've wished I was dead
rather than face him.

269
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:39,625
In the end, I changed my mind

270
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,595
and was able to smile like that again.

271
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:45,464
You have no idea
how much I drove back then.

272
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:48,467
I'm sick of driving.
I still try to avoid driving.

273
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:49,702
Even when I'm not drunk,

274
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:53,072
I use a chauffeur service
so that I don't have to drive.

275
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:55,040
After using the chauffeur service so much,

276
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,942
I even ended up being a model for them.

277
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,479
<i>Phone number
That's the same…</i>

278
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:01,580
<i>-On both sides
-On both sides</i>

279
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:02,815
That's how it happened.

280
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,818
A person should be the same
on both sides as well.

281
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:09,088
The thing about Ho-dong is, though,

282
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,357
once someone stands out to him,

283
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,392
he can turn that person into a star.

284
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,895
Remember how he shouted,
"Seung-gi!", all the time?

285
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,696
I also managed to grab his attention.

286
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:20,132
It was when we were shooting
our very first opening.

287
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:21,801
We started introducing ourselves.

288
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:23,469
"Hello, I'm Eun Ji-won."

289
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:25,504
Seung-gi mentioned his song,
"You're My Girl."

290
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:29,041
I don't know whether he had a girl or not.
Anyway, it was all going well.

291
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,610
Then it was my turn.

292
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:33,646
Ho-dong suddenly said, "Everyone.

293
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:35,648
The greatest comedian of our time.

294
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:40,386
This amazing man
can make everyone crack up

295
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:43,556
just by introducing himself.

296
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:45,524
Let's hear what he has to say.

297
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:49,028
Everyone, you won't be disappointed."

298
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,697
He was setting me up to fail.

299
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:54,099
You know what I mean, right?

300
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,302
I broke out in a cold sweat.

301
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:58,003
I still have nightmares.

302
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,906
But you know what?
I managed to make everyone laugh.

303
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:04,510
"Howdy, everyone."

304
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:07,713
That greeting even got me a commercial.

305
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,616
Back then, I was the one
walking on eggshells around Ho-dong.

306
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,318
But these days,

307
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,587
Ho-dong walks on eggshells
around me as well.

308
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,455
"Su-geun, put your hand to your face.

309
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,524
I'll pretend to slap you in the face."

310
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,492
Then he will slap me and I'll fake it.

311
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:23,162
Before, he would call my name
and just slap me right away.

312
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,599
Now, he's more careful with me.

313
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:29,702
But if it hadn't been for Ho-dong,

314
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:32,972
I wouldn't have made it this far.

315
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:36,141
But most of all,
some of you may remember this.

316
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,843
On <i>2 Days & 1 Night</i>,

317
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:41,513
we once went on a retreat
and had tea time together.

318
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,148
And someone brought persimmons.

319
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,884
Instead of eating them right away,

320
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,652
Ho-dong suddenly asked,

321
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:50,055
"Do any of you know how to say,
'persimmon,' in English?"

322
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:52,524
If Seung-gi knew the answer, that'd be it.

323
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:53,859
It wouldn't have been funny.

324
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:55,961
But even Seung-gi seemed clueless.

325
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,363
No one knew the answer.

326
00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:00,366
I thought this was my chance
to make a joke.

327
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:02,201
"None of you know the answer?

328
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,370
Repeat after me.

329
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:07,907
'Bitter.'"

330
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:10,442
Everyone cracked up.

331
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:11,744
Ho-dong found it hilarious.

332
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,579
"Then what's 'mandarin' in English?"

333
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,014
"Sour."

334
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,383
"Sour." It was perfect.

335
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:19,418
I was actually debating

336
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:23,055
between "sour" and "Jeju."

337
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:24,089
I couldn't decide.

338
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:25,858
I can say any fruit names.

339
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,459
What's "watermelon" in English?

340
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:29,061
In one syllable, "spit."

341
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:31,764
What else?

342
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:32,765
-What?
-"Banana."

343
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:34,166
That's already English.

344
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,470
That's already English.

345
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:40,940
"Korean melon"? Gosh.

346
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:42,474
That one is a bit long.

347
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,610
"Seeds in poop."

348
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:49,148
"Seeds in poop."
That's "Korean melon" in English.

349
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:51,016
Don't pretend you don't understand.

350
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,219
I've been walking on eggshells
around Ho-dong a lot,

351
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:58,357
but recently, I've met another person

352
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:01,894
who makes me walk on eggshells.

353
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,195
Let me show you.

354
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:06,932
It's this person.

355
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:09,101
He's extremely poisonous

356
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:10,869
and always angry.

357
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:12,304
With his cheeks puffed up,

358
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:14,440
he's ready to attack you at any moment.

359
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:16,508
It's comedian Lee Kyung-kyu.

360
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:18,110
I met him recently and told him,

361
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:22,715
"I'm doing a stand-up comedy show
with Netflix.

362
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:25,384
It's called <i>The Sense Coach</i>."

363
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:28,587
He went, "What? 'Sense Coach'?
What's that?"

364
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,923
He yelled at me
when he could just talk calmly.

365
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,727
I asked him if I could portray him
as a pufferfish.

366
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:37,629
"No! I'm not an ordinary pufferfish.
I'm a striped pufferfish!

367
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,265
It's delicious.

368
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,234
But its poison can kill you."

369
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:46,405
He is extremely kind
to the people who are nice to him.

370
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:49,241
But if you get on his wrong side,
you can get killed.

371
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,610
He's always frowning.

372
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,978
He's always ready to attack.

373
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,880
As if he has duct tape on his forehead.

374
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:56,615
{\an8}We go fishing together,

375
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,385
{\an8}and everything upsets him.

376
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,186
{\an8}Good weather upsets him,

377
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:02,621
and rain upsets him, too.

378
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,823
He gets angry at the captain
if fish don't bite.

379
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,025
"Why did you pick today?"

380
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:07,793
He gets angry if one of us get a hit.

381
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,961
And if we catch a lot,

382
00:17:09,027 --> 00:17:10,763
he's angry his arms hurt.

383
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:14,400
Sometimes, after being on a boat
for a long time, he gets tired.

384
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:17,636
Then he makes a joke,
and it's important to notice this.

385
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:22,207
You have to figure out
whether he's joking or serious.

386
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:24,443
Since I spend so much time with him,

387
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,478
I can tell right away
if he's joking or not.

388
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,313
While fishing,

389
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,583
he'll suddenly yell at me,
"What are you staring at?"

390
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,653
Then I respond right away.
"What are you staring at?" "Kyung-kyu."

391
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,189
"What are you?" "Your fellow comedian."

392
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,792
"Look at you." "Fine, look at me."

393
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:41,627
"Look at me." Kyung-kyu cracks up.

394
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:45,631
He's so happy that I play along with him.

395
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:47,533
But some people can't tell.

396
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:51,270
When Kyung-kyu is joking, it shows
because he sounds extra aggressive.

397
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:53,205
"What are you staring at?" He's joking.

398
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:55,307
Sometimes, he sounds more serious.

399
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:57,042
"What are you staring at?"

400
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,445
It means he's not in a good mood

401
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:02,448
and he genuinely wants you
to stop staring at him.

402
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:04,516
But some people can't take a hint.

403
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,185
I won't mention names, though.

404
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,120
"What are you staring at?"

405
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:09,388
"What do you think?

406
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:13,158
My cornea is scanning you
and I am looking at you.

407
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:16,762
Do you have a problem with that?"

408
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:17,663
They say that.

409
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:21,033
-Ji Sang-ryeol.
-That's right. It's Ji Sang-ryeol.

410
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,570
Then Kyung-kyu says, "What's with you?

411
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:26,138
We can't even air that.

412
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,240
Are you out of your mind?"

413
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,242
It's important to take a hint.

414
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,945
I'm one of the senior comedians now.

415
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:36,215
Since I usually appear on TV
with Ho-dong and Kyung-kyu,

416
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,784
you may think I'm still young,

417
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:40,719
but I'm one of the older ones now.

418
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:41,954
When I'm shooting,

419
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:46,325
{\an8}I sometimes have to walk on eggshells
around people younger than me.

420
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:49,128
{\an8}I often do shows with idol groups.

421
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:52,898
I usually come to work dressed casually.

422
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,434
But the clothes that younger people wear

423
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,069
look weird to me.

424
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,370
I just don't understand.

425
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:02,074
They're all designer clothes,
but I don't get it.

426
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,976
Who do you think I'm talking about?

427
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:06,345
Song Min-ho. I mean MINO.

428
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:07,779
His clothes look so fancy.

429
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:09,915
People in their teens and 20s love them.

430
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,517
But I don't get it.

431
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,285
They're all designer clothes.

432
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:15,053
I greet MINO like this.

433
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,822
"Hey, BB!"

434
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:17,990
"Hey, BB, what's up?"

435
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:19,892
He'd ask me, "What does BB mean?"

436
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,426
I'd say, "It means bling-bling."

437
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,362
He wears so much jewelry.

438
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,199
You like that. You must be a fan of MINO.

439
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:31,003
I thought that since people
of all ages watch our show,

440
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:33,338
it'd be better if he dressed more neatly.

441
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:36,842
But if I say, "What's with your outfit?",
he says, "It's my style."

442
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:41,380
Young people started treating me
the same way I treated Kyung-kyu.

443
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,482
It's a wake up call.

444
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:46,451
"They all have their own styles.

445
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:50,088
Instead of finding fault,
I should accept them as who they are."

446
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:53,058
Back in the day,
it was even more important to take a hint

447
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,327
{\an8}while shooting TV shows.

448
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,996
{\an8}We were supposed to be shooting
a hidden camera show,

449
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,831
but the cameras were all visible.

450
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,334
Then a call came.

451
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:04,803
"Can you lend me 40 million won?"

452
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,471
Since you can see the cameras,

453
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,774
you say,
"Okay. Send me your account number."

454
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,009
Who does that?
So you knew what was going on,

455
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:13,512
but you had to pretend to be oblivious.

456
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:16,348
Back then, hypnosis shows were common

457
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,116
but they were really awkward.

458
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:20,152
I know you're laughing
because you remember.

459
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,222
Some other comedians and I
were gathered in the waiting room,

460
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:24,656
and the producer walked in.

461
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,559
"This hypnotist is incredible.

462
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:32,130
We tested him, and he managed to hypnotize
all ten crew members.

463
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:34,166
One of them saw his late mother,

464
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,635
one of them said
she was a princess in her past life.

465
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:38,403
It worked for all ten of them."

466
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,638
Why did he tell us that?

467
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:42,541
-So that you play along.
-He was trying to tell us…

468
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,644
to play along.

469
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:47,579
That's what he was saying indirectly.

470
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:49,982
I could take a hint,
so I entered the room.

471
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:51,283
Then it started.

472
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,885
"Look at this marble.

473
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:58,991
As soon as I say, 'Red sun!',
you'll fall asleep.

474
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:00,659
Red sun!"

475
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:02,961
You'd normally fall asleep like this.

476
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:04,696
But I was overzealous.

477
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,231
"Red sun!"

478
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,335
I dropped my head. All comedians do that.

479
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:13,005
I couldn't get the producer's face
off my mind.

480
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:14,473
I wanted to do a good job.

481
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:16,908
"What kind of questions
will the hypnotist ask?

482
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:18,110
What should I answer?"

483
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:20,379
My head was full of these questions.

484
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,913
The hypnotist asked me.

485
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:25,017
"Su-geun, where are you now?"

486
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,385
"Next to you."

487
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:28,186
"I'm right next to you."

488
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:29,354
"Who is with you?"

489
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,590
"Who else? You. It's just the two of us."

490
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:34,059
If I'd said that,
it would've been hilarious.

491
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,994
But I couldn't.

492
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:39,931
I told him. "I see a chimney.

493
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:42,734
Someone is starting a fire
in the furnace."

494
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,337
"Who is that person?"
"I think it's my grandma.

495
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:48,407
She's crying."

496
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,242
I wasn't under hypnosis.

497
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,910
I was making things up.

498
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,478
He would then ask me more questions.

499
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:56,381
"Why is she crying?"

500
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:58,016
"Because of you."

501
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,786
I wanted to say that, but I couldn't.

502
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:02,120
I said, "I have no idea.

503
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:04,156
She's just crying."

504
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:07,893
That gave the hypnotist confidence.
He thought I was completely hypnotized.

505
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,995
He handed me something.

506
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:11,997
I grabbed it and it smelled like an onion.

507
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:15,434
"From now on,
whatever you put in your mouth

508
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:18,136
will taste like a delicious apple.

509
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,471
You'll be eating an apple."

510
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:22,040
But it was obviously an onion.

511
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:26,011
He shoved it in my mouth.

512
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:30,882
But I could smell it.

513
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:33,919
I took a bite.

514
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:36,254
It made me cry.

515
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:39,591
But I couldn't say it was an onion.

516
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:41,326
"What is this?

517
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:44,863
I've never tasted an apple this delicious.

518
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:48,100
Grandma. Have some.

519
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,868
Go on, grandma."

520
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:51,503
"What does she say?"

521
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:54,306
"'You lunatic.
Do you expect me to eat this?'

522
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,109
That's what she says." I told him.

523
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:59,444
He took the hint and said,
"You're waking up now."

524
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:02,280
The producer at the back looked satisfied.

525
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:03,749
He gave me a sign.

526
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:05,150
Those who can't take a hint.

527
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,552
They frown as soon as they bite the onion.

528
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:09,521
They eat one more and frown again.

529
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:12,557
After eating five onions,
they finally say, "It's delicious."

530
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:16,695
They can't take a hint.

531
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:21,133
It's important to take a hint
when shooting TV shows.

532
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:23,602
Since I'm good at that,

533
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:25,670
I thought my kids would be the same.

534
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,940
{\an8}But it seems to have nothing
to do with genes.

535
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:32,010
{\an8}I actually learned to do it on my own.

536
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:35,747
My son, Tae-jun, is into gymnastics.

537
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:37,048
He's my eldest.

538
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:40,952
I think it's called the Tkatchev.
Let me show you some pictures.

539
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,621
That's him doing gymnastics.

540
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:44,756
He's in seventh grade.

541
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:47,225
Look at that. He's up in the air.

542
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:49,194
That's gymnastics. Look at that.

543
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:52,197
He's on a horizontal bar.

544
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,600
He's so brave.
He can pull off all kinds of things.

545
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,736
One day, I heard him giggling in his room.

546
00:23:57,803 --> 00:23:59,971
It sounded like he was
asking someone questions.

547
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:01,239
When I went to see,

548
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:04,209
he was watching a live broadcast online.

549
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,778
It looked as if there were
hundreds of viewers,

550
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:08,346
but there were only three.

551
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:11,283
My son was the most active participant.

552
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:12,751
One day, he told me seriously,

553
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:15,420
"Dad, I want to go to the US."

554
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:18,056
I thought he was finally growing up.

555
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,392
He must want to broaden his horizons,

556
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:24,129
learn English, and experience new things.

557
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:27,532
So I decided to support him at all costs.

558
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:28,600
I asked him,

559
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:31,036
"Tae-jun, why do you
want to go to the US?"

560
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:34,306
He says, "There are
many horizontal bars in the US."

561
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:36,608
Is that true?

562
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:39,444
There must be people
from Netflix headquarters here.

563
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:41,813
I really wanted to ask them this.

564
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:44,316
"How many horizontal bars…"

565
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:51,089
I have no idea who told him that.

566
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:55,026
There's another live broadcast tonight,
so I'm going to ask him.

567
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:56,495
He's Tae-jun's role model.

568
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:58,663
I'd be his fourth viewer.

569
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:01,166
He must know the answer.

570
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:06,171
It really made me realize
that wits are not inherited.

571
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:08,540
I have another son,

572
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:09,975
and he's more like me.

573
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:13,812
One day, I was having a drink.

574
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:16,648
My wife and two sons were with me.
I told my sons seriously,

575
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:19,584
"Mom and Dad are going to build
a small house in the countryside

576
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:21,686
and live there until we die.

577
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:23,788
If your mom dies first, I'll follow her.

578
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,191
That's our plan.
You guys do whatever you want.

579
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:27,826
Forget about horizontal bars."

580
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:30,028
I told them seriously to wake them up.

581
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:32,297
"But we'll leave some money behind
for you guys."

582
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,534
My other son, Tae-seo, said,
"Dad, you can't leave us like that."

583
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,969
I asked him, "Why not?"

584
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,639
He said,
"Tell us where the money is first."

585
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,874
I found it so funny.

586
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:44,409
He really said that.

587
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:46,478
He's clever. He wants to know.

588
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:49,948
Tae-jun, my eldest son, sure is
more mature.

589
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:52,017
"Hey, do you care more about money

590
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:54,586
than Mom and Dad? How could you?

591
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:57,556
It's more important
that they are healthy and stay with us."

592
00:25:57,622 --> 00:26:01,459
Then he asked me. "Dad, will there be
horizontal bars in the countryside?"

593
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:04,663
I made that up.

594
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:06,798
Did you like that?

595
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:12,170
I think it was due to how I was raised

596
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,939
{\an8}that made me so quick-witted.

597
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:15,907
{\an8}I changed schools so many times.

598
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:18,443
{\an8}I attended two elementary school
graduation ceremonies.

599
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,446
In all my childhood photos,

600
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:24,482
I'm glancing at someone.

601
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,318
Where am I looking?

602
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:28,186
Look at that.

603
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,255
Where is this kid looking?

604
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:32,424
He's glancing at someone.

605
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:33,792
One day

606
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:37,395
back in elementary school,

607
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:39,698
I was playing soccer with some friends.

608
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:41,866
I was in third or fourth grade.

609
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,903
That's my school.
And I was playing soccer.

610
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:48,807
Suddenly, a cultivator
rolled into the schoolyard.

611
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:50,442
On the cultivator,

612
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:52,711
there was a small wardrobe.

613
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,479
Yes, like that.

614
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:56,514
I said, a "small" wardrobe.

615
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:58,350
It's fine. Leave it.

616
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:03,121
There was even an electric fan
loaded on the cultivator.

617
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:05,190
It wasn't that big, either.

618
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:06,992
It's okay. Leave it.

619
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:08,627
It's an electric fan.

620
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:10,962
Anyway, the cultivator rolled in
all of a sudden.

621
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:12,831
I thought it was some crazy old man.

622
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:15,433
There were kids playing,
and it could've been dangerous.

623
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,068
Why drive a cultivator there?

624
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:20,205
But when I looked closely,
it was my father.

625
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:22,040
My father was driving the cultivator

626
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:24,042
loaded with all that stuff.

627
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:27,245
So… Wait, he wasn't wearing a cap.

628
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,381
It's okay. Let's pretend he did.

629
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:32,117
Anyway, it was him.

630
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:34,519
Then he told me to hop on.

631
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,222
I said to my friends, "See you tomorrow.

632
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:40,025
Sorry I have to leave early," as usual.

633
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:41,326
Then we set off.

634
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:44,529
But my dad started driving
in the opposite direction of home.

635
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:46,731
The cultivator rolled on.

636
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:47,999
On and on.

637
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:50,435
My dad turned around now and then.

638
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,470
It wasn't to make sure I was still there,

639
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:55,040
but to make sure
the electric fan hadn't fallen off.

640
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:58,076
I didn't even ask him.
I was just sitting there at the back.

641
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:01,713
We arrived in a completely
different neighborhood.

642
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:05,116
He told me, "You and I are
living in this house starting today."

643
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,886
There was a tiny school nearby.

644
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:10,922
"You're going to that school
starting tomorrow."

645
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:14,859
I didn't understand what was going on.
Then a lady showed up.

646
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,796
I'd seen her a few times
in the neighborhood.

647
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,832
My dad told me, "She's your mom now."

648
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:24,002
But I already had a mom.

649
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:26,237
I wet the bed
all the way through middle school.

650
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:27,806
It was because

651
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,941
my dad and my step…

652
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:32,377
I used to call her "lady"
but she's "Mother" now.

653
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:34,713
She's old now
and has been with my dad for decades.

654
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:37,882
I couldn't go to the bathroom
because I was afraid I'd wake them up.

655
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:40,385
For some reason,
my dad would sometimes wave his hand

656
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:43,321
in front of my face
to check if I was asleep.

657
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,156
I don't know why he did that, though.

658
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:48,326
Anyway, he used to do this.

659
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,994
I don't know why.

660
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:53,131
I doubt he wanted to check
if I was still alive.

661
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:55,867
That went on for months.

662
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:58,670
He kept waving his hand
in front of me at night.

663
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:01,973
I still don't know what that was about.

664
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,209
I was too young to understand.

665
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:07,846
I visited my dad over the holidays

666
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,048
and recreated this scene.

667
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:11,750
Here's a photo.

668
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:15,086
It was taken during the New Year holidays.

669
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:18,289
I'm out of frame, right?
I'll tell you why.

670
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:20,825
We couldn't find anyone
who could take a photo of us.

671
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:23,228
My dad is 80,
and he's the youngest around there.

672
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:25,897
This was taken by a 90-year-old man
who was passing by.

673
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:29,734
He kept pressing the button too long
and ended up taking videos.

674
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:33,505
And I don't know what he pressed
but he left eight selfies on my phone.

675
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:36,107
Some photos only show
a part of the cultivator.

676
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:37,575
This is the best shot we got.

677
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:39,911
What I wanted to recreate was the moment

678
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:43,615
where I asked my dad,
"Dad, where are we going?"

679
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:46,151
And that's exactly how he looked
back then.

680
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:49,120
His son is successful
and even gives him money sometimes,

681
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:51,523
so he should smile more
but he still looks so stiff.

682
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:54,526
But shortly after taking that photo,

683
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,763
my dad fell ill

684
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,932
and had a major surgery.

685
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:04,369
I'm not sure if I should say this here,

686
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:07,105
but last week, he…

687
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:09,507
he regained his health.

688
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:12,977
I got a call.

689
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:15,413
He's very healthy now.

690
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,750
My dad never walks on eggshells
around anyone.

691
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,052
He always pushes forward no matter what.

692
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,754
One day back in elementary school,

693
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,956
my dad was gone
when I woke up in the morning.

694
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:26,991
My brother and I panicked.

695
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:28,560
We didn't have anything to eat,

696
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:30,995
so my brother made
whatever dishes he could make.

697
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:33,398
On the third day, my dad came back.

698
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:35,934
"Dad, where have you been?"
"I went sightseeing."

699
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,102
He went sightseeing.

700
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:41,139
"Why didn't you leave any money?"
"You didn't find it?"

701
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:43,341
In the corner of the small room,

702
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:46,377
he picked up a 5,000-won bill
and gave it to us.

703
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:48,580
He had crumpled it and chucked it there.

704
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:50,715
Once, it was Christmas Eve.

705
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:53,084
My dad said,
"Oh, it's Christmas tomorrow."

706
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:55,086
He said nothing else.

707
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:57,288
We thought, "Dad knows
it's Christmas tomorrow?"

708
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:00,992
So at night before bed, we took a pair
of Dad's military socks.

709
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:02,594
Those huge ones.

710
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,963
We hung them before going to bed.

711
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:08,166
The next morning, we found
that Dad had worn them and left.

712
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:11,603
He wore them and left.

713
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:15,006
He must have wanted to wear
thick socks on Christmas Day.

714
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:19,978
That's the only memory of Christmas
my brother and I have.

715
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:24,249
Once, a TV show needed
a picture of me on my first birthday.

716
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:27,218
So I called Dad and asked
if he had any pictures from that day.

717
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:28,786
"No." "Why not?"

718
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:30,755
"We didn't have a party."

719
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:34,125
In the end, I had to borrow
a picture from Byung-man.

720
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:37,996
He was the one who looked most like me
that I could find.

721
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:41,599
I asked him if he had any pictures,
and he did.

722
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:44,402
As far as I know,
his family wasn't well-off, either.

723
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:47,005
That's Kim Byung-man there.

724
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,940
Who could tell? So I asked Dad,

725
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:52,644
"Does this look like me?"
"It's a spitting image of you.

726
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:57,081
No one will tell. The boy looks smart."

727
00:31:57,148 --> 00:31:59,117
I thought he'd apologize to me.

728
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:01,986
But all he said was
that this looks just like me.

729
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:04,322
Speaking of kids,

730
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:06,724
{\an8}have you ever seen kids
who are vaguely cute?

731
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:09,794
{\an8}Not all kids are pretty and cute.

732
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:12,597
Sometimes, a friend
brings his or her baby.

733
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:13,665
And I go,

734
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:17,936
"Goodness. My dear.

735
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:19,637
He's become so big.

736
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:22,106
It feels like yesterday you were pregnant.

737
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:26,711
Oh, my. And look how big he is now."

738
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:30,181
I don't comment on how the baby looks,
just on how much he's grown.

739
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:33,284
"My goodness. Unbelievable. Gosh."

740
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:34,786
You know what I mean, right?

741
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:37,021
I don't want to offend anyone.

742
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:38,690
Sometimes, you say,

743
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:41,759
"A boy…",
but the parent says, "It's a girl."

744
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:43,895
Then I say, "A boy is all you need then.

745
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:47,131
I'm sure he'll be as beautiful
as this girl.

746
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:48,800
You'll be a great dad."

747
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:51,269
You have to come up with something quick.

748
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:54,339
And it's always better to assume
a baby is a girl.

749
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:56,374
"My, look at this beautiful princess."

750
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:59,477
Even if it's a boy,
mothers like to hear that.

751
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:02,580
"Oh, it's a boy? But he's so pretty.

752
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:05,550
He must take after you."
That's not going to offend anyone.

753
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:09,087
How much cash do you give
as a wedding gift? Do you have any rules?

754
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,089
If it's just an acquaintance, 50,000 won.

755
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,857
If it's a close friend, 100,000 won.

756
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:16,928
If it's a family member,
200,000 to 300,000 won.

757
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,297
If you haven't talked in five, six years,

758
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:21,165
an emoji will do.

759
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,501
An emoji will do.

760
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:25,670
If you reply and start a conversation,

761
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,405
you have to go to the wedding.

762
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:30,108
An emoji will signal
that the friendship is over.

763
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,010
It's a bad idea to start a conversation.

764
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:33,311
It's vague, right?

765
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:35,847
An acquaintance invited me to his wedding,

766
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:37,482
so I brought 100,000 won.

767
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:40,051
A friend of mine
hadn't withdrawn cash yet,

768
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:42,086
so I followed him to the ATM.

769
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:44,889
But then I saw him withdraw 200,000 won.

770
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:48,126
The thing is, I was closer to the groom
than he was.

771
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:51,129
I was worried
the groom would be disappointed in me.

772
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:54,365
Gosh. So I ended up withdrawing
an extra 200,000 won.

773
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:56,768
I thought I should give more.

774
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:58,369
So I handed in 300,000 won.

775
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,805
When it was my friend's turn,

776
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:04,375
he asked for four envelopes
and put 50,000 won in each.

777
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:06,711
He was handing them in
on behalf of other friends.

778
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:08,946
If only he'd handed them in first.

779
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:11,049
Then I would've handed in
just 100,000 won.

780
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:14,652
I handed in mine first,
and he handed in four envelopes.

781
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,020
No one compensated me.

782
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,556
So annoying, right?

783
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:19,891
Isn't it so vague?

784
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:24,228
It's not just weddings.
Kids' first birthday parties are the same.

785
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:26,798
I'll take Sung-kwang for example.

786
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:30,368
Let's say my beloved fellow comedian's
baby is turning one.

787
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:31,736
Since we're close,

788
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:35,206
I decide to give him a million won.

789
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:37,141
I'm his senior, so of course.

790
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:41,479
I arrive at the party with a million won.

791
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:43,281
"Sung-kwang, congratulations."

792
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:45,183
But I see that his wife is pregnant.

793
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,985
"Oh, no. If I give him a million won now,

794
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:51,222
I'll have to give him another million
next time. Hold on."

795
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,660
I go into the bathroom
and take 500,000 won out.

796
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:58,629
I give Sung-kwang 500,000 won.

797
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:01,699
Because I'd have to do the same thing
in a year.

798
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,000
So, this is what I do these days.

799
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:05,703
When I hear about a birthday party,
I call and ask,

800
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,405
"Should I MC the party for you?"

801
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:11,075
If I'm the host…
You know what I mean, right?

802
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:12,210
I get paid.

803
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:16,180
So I try to be the host
instead of giving a gift.

804
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:19,217
{\an8}I used to be a recreation instructor.

805
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,786
{\an8}I've led many events in different regions.

806
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:24,522
{\an8}Different regions have different dialects.

807
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:27,391
The Chungcheong dialect
was the most interesting.

808
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,027
"Forget it. Stop it. Come on."

809
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:31,929
Everything they say ends in "yu."

810
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:33,965
"Next up is IU." Like this.

811
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:35,633
But not everything ends with "yu".

812
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,436
The dialect in Cheonan and Asan
is really interesting.

813
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:41,305
My friend, Sang-won, lives there.

814
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:44,342
When I'm leaving,
he says, "Are you leaving already?

815
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:47,945
Stay and eat with us, huh?"

816
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:51,482
"Stay and eat with us, huh?"

817
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:55,486
"What are you doing over the holidays?
Why do you never call, huh?"

818
00:35:57,088 --> 00:35:59,423
Like the singer, Lee Seung-chul,
holds a note,

819
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,492
he speaks like that.

820
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:02,827
"What are you up to?

821
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:06,230
Come over for coffee, huh?"

822
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:08,966
Why doesn't he just say
the whole sentence slowly?

823
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:10,902
He says the first part really fast

824
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:12,803
and drags out the latter part.

825
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:15,473
"Come see me when you have time, huh?"

826
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:19,210
That's the Chungcheong dialect.

827
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:21,913
I wonder if foreigners will be able
to understand this.

828
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:24,549
Even in our daily lives,

829
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:27,952
we often walk on eggshells around people.

830
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:31,322
Some of you may have even felt bad
about coming here today.

831
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:35,927
So now, I'd like to give you some advice
on how to behave.

832
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:37,195
I'm your coach today.

833
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:40,531
{\an8}Do any of you want me

834
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:43,401
{\an8}to give you some advice?

835
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:46,604
Raise your hand,
and I'll answer your questions.

836
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:48,072
The woman at the back. Go on.

837
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:51,175
-Should I stand up?
-Just read the room.

838
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,713
All right. What's troubling you?

839
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,182
{\an8}I'm the eldest child.

840
00:36:58,249 --> 00:36:59,984
{\an8}In both families.

841
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,253
-You mean both your mom and dad's sides?
-Yes.

842
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,588
Gosh, okay.

843
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:06,891
I don't know if that's why,
but I feel uncomfortable at home.

844
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:08,926
I'm always walking on eggshells at home.

845
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:13,364
-And?
-And I'm always the mediator.

846
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:16,067
-You feel uncomfortable at home?
-Yes, at home.

847
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:18,703
If I'm away from home for a few days,

848
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:22,773
my family always fights
and things become awkward.

849
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,243
-You live with your parents?
-Yes.

850
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:27,511
-It's not like my family, is it?
-No.

851
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:30,781
-It's not like that.
-Then what?

852
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:32,483
I can't relax at home.

853
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,853
I walk on eggshells all the time.

854
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,022
Even when my parents are eating together,

855
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,790
if they start raising their voices,

856
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:42,526
I have to come out and sit with them
but my sister--

857
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,162
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure
how I can help you with that.

858
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:49,867
If you decide to move out,
I could help you find a place.

859
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,670
-Do you have any siblings?
-I have a little sister.

860
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:54,338
-How old is she?
-She's 20.

861
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:56,374
-She doesn't walk on eggshells?
-No.

862
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,842
Then live like her.

863
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,778
It's simple.

864
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:03,214
Why should you shoulder all the burden?

865
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:07,084
Since you're the eldest child
on both sides of the family,

866
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:10,855
it's understandable
that your parents rely on you a lot.

867
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:13,324
-Yes.
-And you can't just ignore that.

868
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:15,192
It's okay if it's your family.

869
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:17,828
It's annoying to walk on eggshells
at work or something,

870
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:20,298
but if it's your family, it's no big deal.

871
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:23,334
That's just a way of communicating,
isn't it?

872
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:25,069
If your parents never fought,

873
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,204
you wouldn't even talk to them at all.

874
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:29,373
You'd be busy on your phone in your room.

875
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,877
They're fighting on purpose
just to talk to you.

876
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:35,212
They're bringing the family together.

877
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:36,981
These days, conversations are rare.

878
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:38,582
We all only talk about ourselves.

879
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,419
Your parents seem to be using
a very advanced technique.

880
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:44,288
They're not divorced or anything.
They still live together.

881
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:45,790
-Do you need duct tape?
-No.

882
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:48,192
No, right? Then it's fine.

883
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:49,927
-I'm rooting for you.
-Thank you.

884
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:53,564
{\an8}Since you can talk about it comfortably,
it's not a serious problem.

885
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:54,765
Anyone else?

886
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,034
The man at the front.

887
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:59,537
I graduated from college last year

888
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:02,206
{\an8}and am looking for a job at the moment.

889
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:04,775
Since I've been unemployed for a year now,

890
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:08,879
I have to walk on eggshells
when I'm at home.

891
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:11,415
During the holidays, my aunts ask me

892
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:13,851
-when I'll find a job.
-Right.

893
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:15,853
They ask those questions, right?

894
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,089
Thankfully, I didn't visit my relatives

895
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:20,057
because of the pandemic this year.

896
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:24,595
I was relieved that I didn't have to see
my grandma and aunts.

897
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:26,364
So you want the pandemic to continue?

898
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,798
No, it's not like that.

899
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:32,069
It should end soon
so I can find a job more easily.

900
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:33,337
I really hope so.

901
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:35,406
But I feel uncomfortable at home.

902
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:39,076
Could you give me some advice on this?

903
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:41,245
How old are you?

904
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,380
I'm 27.

905
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:44,648
You're young.
You've done military service, too.

906
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,550
Your life is yours.

907
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:49,320
You said you're 27.

908
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,456
Who knows if you'll make it
when you're 28, 29, or 30?

909
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:54,825
When that happens,
be good to your parents,

910
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,227
and they'll be happy.

911
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:58,929
My father used to hang up right away
when I called him.

912
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:02,433
When I was a nobody,
he'd hang up immediately.

913
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,902
So I never visited him. It's true.

914
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:07,838
"Your friend so-and-so
became a car mechanic

915
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,440
and is a manager now.

916
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:11,108
What are you doing with your life?"

917
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:12,676
But he's like this now.

918
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:21,185
"Look at this party Su-geun threw for me."
It's like that.

919
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,454
Just wait for that day to come.
You're family.

920
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:25,723
Your family is just concerned about you.

921
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,792
They're not trying to find fault with you.

922
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:30,694
No one can wait for you longer
than your family can.

923
00:40:31,495 --> 00:40:34,899
{\an8}That's very important. Your family.

924
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:38,602
{\an8}Sung-kwang, include things like this,
or people won't like it.

925
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,972
Anyone else? Ask away.

926
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:44,575
Go ahead. The woman over there.

927
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:47,144
I got a job last November.

928
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:48,412
Congratulations.

929
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:50,748
I found a job straight out of high school.

930
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:52,683
-Right away?
-Yes.

931
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,118
Look at her.

932
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:57,888
She can do it, you can do it.

933
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,957
-And?
-I'm a lot younger

934
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:02,026
{\an8}-than my bosses and colleagues…
-Go on.

935
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:03,594
{\an8}…so I feel uncomfortable.

936
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:05,262
How much older are they?

937
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:07,765
About nine years older and more.

938
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:10,968
Don't you just call them
using their titles?

939
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:14,572
But apart from Manager and Deputy Manager,

940
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,408
my workplace doesn't have
a clear hierarchy.

941
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,710
There aren't many different levels.

942
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:22,680
And there are more men than women.

943
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:26,116
I usually call them by their first names
or just say, "Excuse me."

944
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:28,252
How about using sir and ma'am?

945
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,821
I think that sounds best.

946
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:34,992
If someone much younger at work
calls you by your first name, like,

947
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:37,294
"Su-geun, can you do this?",

948
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:41,799
I think it creates more distance.
Don't you think?

949
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:43,501
They use honorifics with me.

950
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:45,236
-Who?
-My colleagues.

951
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:49,273
Get up on your desk and shout,
"Hey, drop the honorifics immediately."

952
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,242
They use honorifics to show respect.

953
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:52,576
-I see.
-It's only natural.

954
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:54,645
Just because you're younger…

955
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:56,480
-What's your name?
-It's Yeon-u.

956
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:58,782
"Yeon-u. Do this. Come here."

957
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:02,419
That's not acceptable
when you're interacting with other people.

958
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:03,587
You deserve respect.

959
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:05,890
Of course they should show respect.

960
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:08,459
{\an8}Since they respect
even the youngest employee,

961
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,928
{\an8}I'm sure it's a very good workplace.

962
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:18,068
It's impossible to not be concerned
about what others are thinking.

963
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:21,005
But whose thoughts should we be
concerned about the most?

964
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:22,273
It's our own.

965
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:25,509
People are concerned more about
their own thoughts than that of others.

966
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:28,379
{\an8}But only you can decide
what you want to be concerned about.

967
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:31,949
One last piece of advice
I want to give you is this.

968
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:34,084
Live as yourself.

969
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:35,386
Be who you are.

970
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:37,187
{\an8}Don't care about what others think.

971
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:39,623
{\an8}Just do what you want.

972
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,191
Regardless of your gender and age,

973
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:43,527
and what point you're at in your life,

974
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:47,197
live the life you want
without worrying about what others think.

975
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:51,101
Wherever you are in life.
Then where are we now?

976
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:53,103
We're at the end of our show.

977
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:57,007
But don't be sad.

978
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:59,343
If Netflix can take a hint,

979
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:02,246
they'll do one more of these shows.

980
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:05,015
When the pandemic is over
and we can have a bigger audience,

981
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:08,686
I'm sure they'll give me
an even greater opportunity.

982
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:11,755
Lastly… Are we ready?

983
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:14,258
We're going to release doves.

984
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:17,494
Please look up.
Be careful when they're released.

985
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:20,264
Here come the doves, the symbol of peace.

986
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:46,991
Thank you. Thank you very much.

987
