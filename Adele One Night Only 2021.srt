She's singing all the songs
I know you want to hear,

been waiting six years for.

And throughout the night,

11
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,299
you'll see my conversation
with Adele was so much fun.

She's as real, as down to earth
as we all believe she is.

138

was the beginning of me

and I haven't figured out yet

what it was that I had
to do for that.

141
00:07:31,407 --> 00:07:33,627
But when I wrote it,
it was a real ode to, like,

142
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,237
little me, older me.

143
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,326
Like, all of these things,
like, you know, so,

144
00:07:37,369 --> 00:07:39,502

145

I'm still here.

146
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:43,637

I'm still here. I still exist,

like, you know,
in every aspect of my life."

148
00:07:45,552 --> 00:07:48,424
Well, it feels like that on 30,

149
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:53,777
you have literally opened up
your soul in a way that

150
00:07:53,821 --> 00:07:56,519
even though we have
heard your pain before,

151
00:07:56,563 --> 00:08:00,088
it feels like pain was almost
like a muse for you for this.

152
00:08:00,131 --> 00:08:01,959
I read something you said--
you said,

153
00:08:02,003 --> 00:08:05,615
"I was singing things
I didn't even realize

154
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:08,400
-I was feeling or thinking."
-Mm-hmm.

155
00:08:08,444 --> 00:08:10,664
So, is that how
the music comes to you?

156
00:08:10,707 --> 00:08:12,883
-Is that a part of your process?
-Yeah.

157
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:15,146
Is the music as catharsis?

158
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,975
Yeah, it definitely
channels from somewhere else.

159
00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:20,543
You know, when I'm singing
and when I'm writing, like...

160
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:22,850
And I was kind of aware
of that on the other albums,

161
00:08:22,893 --> 00:08:24,852
but this one, you know,
a lot more

162
00:08:24,895 --> 00:08:27,158
I-I felt it because everything
was happening in real time.

163
00:08:27,202 --> 00:08:28,682
I was writing my album,
you know, while I was

164
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:30,553
-going through everything.
-Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

165
00:08:30,597 --> 00:08:34,644
But I don't think as a person
I have what my singing has.

166

-What do you mean?
-I just think there's-there's

167

something I'm pulling from
somewhere else.

168
00:08:38,605 --> 00:08:40,563

you know, something else

169

from underneath.

-and you think deep, right?
-Yeah. Yeah,

175
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:55,012
you know,
or I'll just be like,

176
00:08:55,056 --> 00:08:57,406
"I am making progress,"
or like, just...

177
00:08:57,449 --> 00:08:59,408
It's-it's a revelation
to me, the songs.

178
00:08:59,451 --> 00:09:01,758
Well, I read something
that you said--

179
00:09:01,802 --> 00:09:03,978
you said, "I'm not shy
or embarrassed

180
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:06,415
to be falling apart."

181
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:09,244
That's one of the reasons why
you feel people are so connected

182
00:09:09,287 --> 00:09:14,597
to your music and I wondered,
what gives you...

183
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:18,732
the-the freedom actually
and the courage to be able to

184
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:23,606
fall apart and expose yourself
in a world and a culture now

185
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,739
-that is a "gotcha" culture...
-Yeah, absolutely.

186
00:09:25,782 --> 00:09:27,741
...that if you make the wrong
move, you say the wrong thing...

187
00:09:27,784 --> 00:09:31,092
-Yeah.
-...somebody's got some,
you know, wisecrack about it.

188
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,616
I think the reason
I'm so brave to do it, you know,

189
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,880
in my career so far was because,
again, music helped me

190
00:09:36,924 --> 00:09:38,926
in any situations
and I would like to do,

191
00:09:38,969 --> 00:09:40,623
you know, the same for people

192
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:42,233
that feel so alone when
they're feeling something.

193
00:09:42,277 --> 00:09:43,800
Mm-hmm.

194
00:09:43,844 --> 00:09:45,759
To be reminded that
they're not alone.

195
00:09:45,802 --> 00:09:48,631
And in terms of now,
you know, there were moments

196
00:09:48,675 --> 00:09:50,067
when I was writing the record or

197
00:09:50,111 --> 00:09:51,721
I would listen back to something
and be like,

198
00:09:51,765 --> 00:09:53,897
"That might be a bit
too private.

199
00:09:53,941 --> 00:09:56,160
"That might be a bit too,
you know,

200
00:09:56,204 --> 00:09:59,468
too about myself and stuff
to put out,"

201
00:09:59,511 --> 00:10:02,166
but nothing is as scary as what
I've been through

202
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:04,255
over the last two, three years
behind closed doors.

203
00:10:04,299 --> 00:10:06,257
So I'm not frightened about...

204
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:08,956

might not do now, you know.

You lost a hundred pounds
in two years.

356

And then you said it wasn't
even really about the weight.

357
00:19:37,001 --> 00:19:38,046
-No.
-So what was it about?

OPRAH:
So here's the thing.

359
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,402
You write about it in
song after song.

360
00:19:46,446 --> 00:19:47,838
You start with, you know,

361
00:19:47,882 --> 00:19:49,405
"Easy on Me"
that-that's been released.

362
00:19:49,449 --> 00:19:53,757
Can you just give us
an idea of what happened

363
00:19:53,801 --> 00:19:55,542
with this all-consuming--

364
00:19:55,585 --> 00:19:58,197
it feels like
an all-consuming pain

365
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,417
and I'm like,
"What the hell happened?"

366
00:20:01,461 --> 00:20:03,071
I've been obsessed with
the nuclear family

367
00:20:03,114 --> 00:20:05,247
my whole life because
I never came from one.

368
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,728
You know, it's in all these
movies and all these books,

369
00:20:07,771 --> 00:20:11,122
like, you know, and you grow up
reading them like that's what

370
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,472
-it should be, like, you know.
-Right.

371
00:20:12,515 --> 00:20:15,431
And... I just
from a very young age,

372
00:20:15,475 --> 00:20:19,000
just, you know, promised myself
that when I had kids

373
00:20:19,043 --> 00:20:22,264
that we'd stay together,
we would be that united family

374
00:20:22,308 --> 00:20:23,570
-and...
-Ah...

375
00:20:23,613 --> 00:20:25,746
And I tried for a really,
really long time

376
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:27,443
and then, um,

377
00:20:27,487 --> 00:20:29,663
I was just so disappointed
for my son.

378
00:20:29,706 --> 00:20:31,534
I was so disappointed
for myself.

379
00:20:31,578 --> 00:20:33,667
And I was just,
I thought I was going to

380
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,625
be the one that, you know,

381
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:38,280
stopped doing those bloody
patterns all the time.

382
00:20:38,324 --> 00:20:42,806
So, do you call this--
is this the divorce album?

383
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,243
I think I'm divorcing myself
on it.

384
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:45,287
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

385
00:20:45,331 --> 00:20:46,984
How does one do that?

386
00:20:47,028 --> 00:20:49,291
So, it's lonely, you know.

387
00:20:49,335 --> 00:20:51,598
I spent a lot of time on my own,

388
00:20:51,641 --> 00:20:53,904
really sitting in my feelings
and not keeping myself busy.

389
00:20:53,948 --> 00:20:55,428
I used to always--
if a feeling came up,

390
00:20:55,471 --> 00:20:56,777
I'd distract myself
or I'd call a friend,

391
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,039
and be like,
"Do you wanna go out?

392
00:20:58,082 --> 00:20:59,693
-What do you wanna do?"
-Yeah.

393
00:20:59,736 --> 00:21:01,347
Put a movie on or whatever.
I would just sit with it.

394
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,436
-I would just eat it myself.
-Yeah, no, absolutely,

395
00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:05,133
but I would just, I would just

396
00:21:05,176 --> 00:21:07,309
whenever I noticed
how I was feeling, I would

397
00:21:07,353 --> 00:21:08,397
sit down and I would sit in it.

398
00:21:08,441 --> 00:21:10,399
Um, I stopped drinking.

399
00:21:10,443 --> 00:21:14,142
That's one great way of,
um, of really sort of getting

400
00:21:14,185 --> 00:21:16,927
to know yourself is being,
you know,

401
00:21:16,971 --> 00:21:19,016
just drinking water
and being sober as anything.

402
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,193
But you've had a fascinating
relationship with alcohol.

403
00:21:22,237 --> 00:21:23,325
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.
-I read where you said that

404
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:24,674
alcohol really fascinated you.

405
00:21:24,718 --> 00:21:26,067
Yeah. Yeah, very much.

406
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:28,069
Yeah, 'cause it took
my dad from me.

407
00:21:28,112 --> 00:21:30,767
-Yeah.
-Yeah, and then you stopped.

408
00:21:30,811 --> 00:21:32,595
Well, when I was going through
everything a couple years ago

409
00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:34,380
when I was going through
my divorce, yes.

410
00:21:34,423 --> 00:21:37,121
Um, not at the beginning.
At first I-- whew, no.

411
00:21:37,165 --> 00:21:39,689
I think I probably kept
the alcohol industry alive.

412
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:41,691
But you know, after--
once I realized that I had

413
00:21:41,735 --> 00:21:43,345
a lot of work to do on myself,

414
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:44,825
yeah, I stopped drinking and I

415
00:21:44,868 --> 00:21:46,217
started working out lots
and stuff like that

416
00:21:46,261 --> 00:21:48,219
to keep me sort of centered.

417
00:21:48,263 --> 00:21:50,352
Was there a moment
when you knew?

418
00:21:50,396 --> 00:21:52,876
Or was it a series of things
that you said,

419
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,966
"Can't do this anymore"?

420
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,012
With my-my journey or in...?

421
00:21:58,055 --> 00:22:00,231
With the divorce from Simon.
Like,

422
00:22:00,275 --> 00:22:02,059
because I-I, you know,

423
00:22:02,103 --> 00:22:04,801
over the years I've interviewed
so many people who stayed,

424
00:22:04,845 --> 00:22:06,977
were miserable, were miserable,

425
00:22:07,021 --> 00:22:10,807
and years before they
actually made the move...

426
00:22:10,851 --> 00:22:12,461
-Yeah.
-...had started
thinking about it,

427
00:22:12,505 --> 00:22:15,986
so I'm wondering, was there
a single moment or was...

428
00:22:17,423 --> 00:22:19,338
I do remember one of my friends,

429
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:21,775
we were all-- we were
answering these questions

430
00:22:21,818 --> 00:22:24,386
-in this very bougie magazine.
-Mm-hmm.

431
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,388
And it was,

432
00:22:26,432 --> 00:22:29,565
it was something like,
"What's something that

433
00:22:29,609 --> 00:22:31,393
no one would ever know
about you?"

434
00:22:31,437 --> 00:22:33,134
And I just said it in front of
three of my friends.

435
00:22:33,177 --> 00:22:35,092
I was like,
"I'm really not happy.

436
00:22:35,136 --> 00:22:36,442
"I'm not, I'm not living.

437
00:22:36,485 --> 00:22:38,531
I'm just plodding along."

438
00:22:38,574 --> 00:22:40,010
And I remember there was a lyric

439
00:22:40,054 --> 00:22:42,186
that I wrote that
I put on a song on-on 25,

440
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,711
which was, "I want to live
and not just survive."

441
00:22:44,754 --> 00:22:46,147
-Mm-hmm.
-And, um,

442
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:48,192
you know, I've definitely
felt like that,

443
00:22:48,236 --> 00:22:50,412
but it was when I, when
I admitted to my own friends,

444
00:22:50,456 --> 00:22:52,196
who thought I was really happy,

445
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,547
that actually I'm really
unhappy, and they all gasped.

446
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:56,592
Like, you know, I feel like it

447
00:22:56,636 --> 00:22:57,941
was sort of from there
that I was like,

448
00:22:57,985 --> 00:23:00,248
"What am I doing?
What am I doing it for?"

449
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:03,207
You know?
But I think it was just,

450
00:23:03,251 --> 00:23:04,948
by us getting married,
us having our wedding,

451
00:23:04,992 --> 00:23:07,168
and I-- you know, I take
marriage very seriously.

452
00:23:07,211 --> 00:23:09,300
-Like, it obviously
seems like...
-Yeah, 'cause you have

453
00:23:09,344 --> 00:23:11,215
-all that stuff from the past.
-Yeah, and it seems
like I don't,

454
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:13,479
you know, now-- like, you know,
almost like I disrespected it

455
00:23:13,522 --> 00:23:16,003
by-by getting married,
and then, you know,

456
00:23:16,046 --> 00:23:17,657
divorced so quickly
and stuff like that.

457
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,876
But I think...

458
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,183
Are embarrassed because it
was so quickly?

459
00:23:22,226 --> 00:23:23,663
I'm just embarrassed that
I didn't make my marriage work.

460
00:23:23,706 --> 00:23:24,968
-Okay.
-You know?

461
00:23:25,012 --> 00:23:26,709
So now that you have perspective

462
00:23:26,753 --> 00:23:28,276
and you've opened up your soul

463
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:30,974
and shared it with the world
here on 30,

464
00:23:31,018 --> 00:23:32,976
why do you think

465
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,892
is the real reason Simon came
into your life?

466
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,981
I think Simon probably saved
my life, to be honest with you.

467
00:23:38,025 --> 00:23:39,809
He came at such a moment,

468
00:23:39,853 --> 00:23:44,814
where the stability that
him and Angelo have given me,

469
00:23:44,858 --> 00:23:46,816
no one else would ever have
been able to give me,

470
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,776
like, especially at that time
in my life-- I was so young

471
00:23:49,819 --> 00:23:52,779
and I just, I think I would have
got a bit lost in all of it.

472
00:23:52,822 --> 00:23:54,955
Like, you know,
and I think I probably,

473
00:23:54,998 --> 00:23:57,000
I could have easily gone down
some dodgy paths,

474
00:23:57,044 --> 00:23:58,349
like, you know?

475
00:23:58,393 --> 00:24:00,177
And sort of self-destructed
from-from

476
00:24:00,221 --> 00:24:03,920
sort of like being so
overwhelmed by all of it.

477
00:24:03,964 --> 00:24:07,489
And he-he came in
and was stable.

478
00:24:07,533 --> 00:24:09,491
The most stable person I've ever

479
00:24:09,535 --> 00:24:11,275
had in my life up
until that point.

480
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:13,364
Even-- you know, even now
I trust him with my life.

481
00:24:13,408 --> 00:24:15,454
-Really?
-Oh, my gosh, like beyond.

482
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:18,152
Like, yeah, I feel like...

483
00:24:18,195 --> 00:24:20,371
Yeah, him and Angelo,
like, they were

484
00:24:20,415 --> 00:24:23,374
angels sent to me,
that's how I feel.

485
00:24:23,418 --> 00:24:25,202
-So, came into your life...
-Mm-hmm.

486
00:24:25,246 --> 00:24:27,291
...at the right season
and for the right reasons.

487
00:24:27,335 --> 00:24:28,902
-To save you.
-Yes, absolutely, yeah.

488
00:24:28,945 --> 00:24:32,166
And in that moment when
Angelo said to you,

489
00:24:32,209 --> 00:24:35,212
"Why don't
you love Daddy anymore?"

490
00:24:35,256 --> 00:24:37,084
Yeah, that was really hard
as well, and trying to explain

491
00:24:37,127 --> 00:24:40,217
to, like, a six-year-old
at the time, obviously,

492
00:24:40,261 --> 00:24:43,394
um, that I do love him,
I'm just not in love with him.

493
00:24:43,438 --> 00:24:45,484
Makes absolutely no sense
to a six-year-old.

494
00:24:45,527 --> 00:24:46,833
Like, you know?

495
00:24:46,876 --> 00:24:48,704
So there were so many answers
I just

496
00:24:48,748 --> 00:24:51,228
couldn't give him
'cause there aren't any really.

497
00:24:51,272 --> 00:24:53,535
Like, you know,
that he would understand,

498
00:24:53,579 --> 00:24:55,755
but he sees
that I still love his dad.

499
00:24:55,798 --> 00:24:57,583
-Like, you know...
-'Cause you live across
the street from each other.

500
00:24:57,626 --> 00:24:59,541
We live across the street from
each other. Like, we, like,

501
00:24:59,585 --> 00:25:03,066
we're away together sometimes,
like, you know, and, um, and...

502
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:05,634
Yeah, like, me and Simon also
chat away without Angelo.

503
00:25:05,678 --> 00:25:07,680
Like, Angelo, you know,
could be at school and...

504
00:25:07,723 --> 00:25:08,811
So you're still friends?

505
00:25:08,855 --> 00:25:10,334
-Oh, yes.
-It's all...

506
00:25:10,378 --> 00:25:11,684
-100%. Yeah, yeah.
-100%.

507
00:25:11,727 --> 00:25:14,208
I respect him more than anyone.

508
00:25:14,251 --> 00:25:16,384
How does he feel about...

509
00:25:16,427 --> 00:25:19,996
this album and the story
of the two of you

510
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,042
-coming through your music?
-Yeah.

511
00:25:22,085 --> 00:25:23,870
I mean, we don't sit around
and talk about it

512
00:25:23,913 --> 00:25:25,741
like, "How you feeling?"
Like, you know,

513
00:25:25,785 --> 00:25:27,482
"Easy on Me" is at 40 million
streams, how are you feeling?

514
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,050
-Like... we don't talk about it.
-[laughs]

515
00:25:30,093 --> 00:25:32,182
But, um, he knows I'm,
you know, he knows

516
00:25:32,226 --> 00:25:33,749
what kind of artist I am, like,

517
00:25:33,793 --> 00:25:35,185
and, you know, that I got to--

518

[cheering]

743
00:40:45,138 --> 00:40:46,792
Thank you very much.

744
00:40:51,057 --> 00:40:53,102
You know, um...

745
00:40:53,146 --> 00:40:55,235
this is the first time--
I got to perch like this

746
00:40:55,278 --> 00:40:57,324
since I can't sit
in this mermaid dress.

747
00:40:57,367 --> 00:40:59,021
[laughter]

748
00:40:59,065 --> 00:41:01,894
I feel like my whole campaign
so far with my outfits

749
00:41:01,937 --> 00:41:04,679
is a bit Death Becomes Her.

750
00:41:04,723 --> 00:41:09,641
Sometimes I'm Hel
and sometimes I'm Mad, you know.

751
00:41:09,684 --> 00:41:11,991
Anyway, this is the first time
that my son

752
00:41:12,034 --> 00:41:13,340
has ever seen me perform.

753
00:41:13,383 --> 00:41:14,994
-[cheering]
-And I got really--

754
00:41:15,037 --> 00:41:16,604
Oh, and he dressed up for me.

755
00:41:16,648 --> 00:41:18,432
It was-- I'm not gonna cry.
Anyway, it's too...

756
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:21,304
it's too soon to cry and I don't
want anyone to come fix my face.

757
00:41:21,348 --> 00:41:24,090
But, um, it's the absolute
honor of my life, baby,

758
00:41:24,133 --> 00:41:26,005
to have you here tonight.

759
00:41:26,048 --> 00:41:28,181
And you look so beautiful,
and so handsome and smart.

760
00:41:28,224 --> 00:41:29,791
[cheering]

761
00:41:29,835 --> 00:41:33,360
OPRAH:
So many women, Adele,

762
00:41:33,403 --> 00:41:35,014
are going to be liberated,
I think,

763
00:41:35,057 --> 00:41:40,236
by listening to you
because so many

764
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,152
women specifically
choose to stay on

765
00:41:43,196 --> 00:41:45,807
in relationships when

766
00:41:45,851 --> 00:41:48,549
they know it's not working,
and they do it for the kids.

767
00:41:48,593 --> 00:41:54,076
And I've read where you said you
weren't miserablemiserable,

768
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,426
-but you also knew you
weren't happy.
-Yeah.

769
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:59,734
And so, you wanted to bring
a happy version

770
00:41:59,778 --> 00:42:01,910
-of yourself to your son.
-Mm-hmm.

771
00:42:01,954 --> 00:42:04,086
-Yes.
-Which I think is about

772
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:06,306
the best gift anybody
can give to their children.

773
00:42:06,349 --> 00:42:08,961
I think, I think
it's the same as,

774
00:42:09,004 --> 00:42:11,354
you know, the same drive
as staying in a relationship

775
00:42:11,398 --> 00:42:13,400
even though you're not happy
and you do it for the kids,

776
00:42:13,443 --> 00:42:14,749
I think it's as loving

777
00:42:14,793 --> 00:42:16,403
as doing that for the kids
by leaving

778
00:42:16,446 --> 00:42:18,710
and-and, you know,
finding your own happiness

779
00:42:18,753 --> 00:42:21,190
so that they really know
who you are.

780
00:42:21,234 --> 00:42:23,715
But I'm still not fully over it,

781
00:42:23,758 --> 00:42:27,545
of me choosing to dismantle
my child's life

782
00:42:27,588 --> 00:42:29,372
-for my own...
-Mm-hmm.

783
00:42:29,416 --> 00:42:31,244
...makes me very uncomfortable.

784
00:42:31,287 --> 00:42:32,593
You still feel guilt?

785
00:42:32,637 --> 00:42:35,727
I don't feel guilt,
I just feel...

786
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:38,425
somewhat selfish sometimes,
but, like, I-I know that

787
00:42:38,468 --> 00:42:40,906
I'm-I'm nearing my goal
of, like,

788
00:42:40,949 --> 00:42:42,864
finding my happiness,
like, you know.

789
00:42:42,908 --> 00:42:44,779
And it's been--
no one ever makes me

790
00:42:44,823 --> 00:42:46,476
do anything I don't want
and it was just like--

791
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,435
but I was really
ignoring myself.

792
00:42:48,478 --> 00:42:50,611
-Yeah.
-For a long time,
which was wild to me

793
00:42:50,655 --> 00:42:52,004
when I realized it;
and I knew

794
00:42:52,047 --> 00:42:54,615
that as an adult,
Angelo would be livid

795
00:42:54,659 --> 00:42:56,356
-with me for doing that.
-Mm-hmm.

796
00:42:56,399 --> 00:42:58,184
I knew that when
he became an adult,

797
00:42:58,227 --> 00:43:01,579
that he'd be furious at me
and I didn't want that, either.

798
00:43:01,622 --> 00:43:03,015
But it was, it was,
it was hard work.

799
00:43:03,058 --> 00:43:04,712
So, this whole album
is dedicated to him.

800
00:43:04,756 --> 00:43:07,149
Yes. Yeah, and the whole album

801
00:43:07,193 --> 00:43:09,369
is not about him, it's about me.

802
00:43:09,412 --> 00:43:12,198
And I just wanted for him
to hear me

803
00:43:12,241 --> 00:43:14,766
talking mad-- madly deeply,

804
00:43:14,809 --> 00:43:17,551
about who I am and how I feel,
like, you know.

805
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,205
And I don't know if I'd ever be
able to have that conversation

806
00:43:19,248 --> 00:43:21,468
with him in real life,
so therefore he can go

807
00:43:21,511 --> 00:43:23,165
and listen to it.

808
00:43:23,209 --> 00:43:25,385
Well, everything on the album
is certainly a starter

809
00:43:25,428 --> 00:43:26,734
for a great conversation.

810
00:43:26,778 --> 00:43:30,738
So, does Angelo know that
you are Adele?

811
00:43:30,782 --> 00:43:33,393
No, apart from the other day,

812
00:43:33,436 --> 00:43:34,873
he watched
the "Easy on Me" video--

813
00:43:34,916 --> 00:43:36,657
like countdown
to when it premiered.

814
00:43:36,701 --> 00:43:39,312
-Yeah.
-Wherever, whatever.
I didn't watch that.

815
00:43:39,355 --> 00:43:41,227
And, um, he was like,
"There was, like,

816
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:43,969
150,000 people waiting,"
and, like, blah-blah-blah.

817
00:43:44,012 --> 00:43:46,493
And he was like,
"You had all these likes."

818
00:43:46,536 --> 00:43:48,582
And then he read
the comments and then...

819
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,323
he was like,
"People really like you."

820
00:43:50,366 --> 00:43:52,151
Like, so he's-he's starting...

821
00:43:52,194 --> 00:43:54,719
-Starting to get it?
-...to get it a little bit,

822
00:43:54,762 --> 00:43:56,546
-but not really.
-Didn't you take him

823
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:58,026
to a Taylor Swift concert
and he was like...

824
00:43:58,070 --> 00:43:59,724
He loved it.

825
00:43:59,767 --> 00:44:01,421
He couldn't believe that
all those people were in there?

826
00:44:01,464 --> 00:44:03,336
Yeah, because he used to come
to my stadium shows

827
00:44:03,379 --> 00:44:05,425
for my rehearsals
and it would be empty.

828
00:44:05,468 --> 00:44:08,210
He was like, "So many people
come to her shows."

829
00:44:08,254 --> 00:44:10,082
[laughs] But I'd make him leave
before they all arrive.

830
00:44:10,125 --> 00:44:13,302
It was so cute and so funny;
he loved it, yeah.

831
00:44:13,346 --> 00:44:15,000
-He's never seen you
perform live?
-No.

832
00:44:15,043 --> 00:44:18,133
-No, this will be
his first time.
-Wow.

833
00:44:18,177 --> 00:44:20,092
-Yeah.
-Yes. Do you
want more children?

834
00:44:20,135 --> 00:44:22,703
I'm-I'm definitely open to it.

835
00:44:22,747 --> 00:44:24,662
I would like more children.
It wouldn't be the end

836
00:44:24,705 --> 00:44:26,620
of the world
if I don't have them,

837
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,362
'cause I have Angelo,
but yeah, I think so.

838
00:44:29,405 --> 00:44:33,279
Every mother and father has
a dream for their children.

839
00:44:33,322 --> 00:44:38,023
And even when you have a big,
accessed life as you do,

840
00:44:38,066 --> 00:44:40,112
and can give your children
any dreams that

841
00:44:40,155 --> 00:44:41,287
-they can imagine...
-Yeah.

842
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:42,680
...actually I think

843
00:44:42,723 --> 00:44:45,204
it's more challenging
to raise children

844
00:44:45,247 --> 00:44:47,249
who are kind
and have their own ambition...

845
00:44:47,293 --> 00:44:49,730
-Yeah. Absolutely.
-...when they have you.

846
00:44:49,774 --> 00:44:53,125
So, what is the dream
you hold for him?

847
00:44:53,168 --> 00:44:56,128
Just to be a good person,
be a good and happy person.

848
00:44:56,171 --> 00:44:58,957
That's it.
I don't expect anything of him.

849
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,308
I don't care what his career is,
as long as he's passionate about

850
00:45:02,351 --> 00:45:05,572
whatever it is that he does
and that he's happy.

851
00:45:10,142 --> 00:45:12,884
[cheering]

852
00:45:12,927 --> 00:45:15,756
So now this is the big surprise
and I'm very, very excited.

853
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,627
I hope we can pull it off.

854
00:45:17,671 --> 00:45:22,545
So, tonight we've arranged...

855
00:45:22,589 --> 00:45:25,374
I'm a bit nervous in case
it doesn't go well.

856
00:45:25,418 --> 00:45:27,463
It's also a bit ironic
that I'm-- that I'm

857
00:45:27,507 --> 00:45:29,901
letting this happen tonight.
We've arranged a surprise

858
00:45:29,944 --> 00:45:32,120
for a lovely guy called Quentin,

859
00:45:32,164 --> 00:45:36,908
who reached out to a, now,
fake show asking for some help,

860
00:45:36,951 --> 00:45:40,128
so... whew,
make me all nervous.

861
00:45:40,172 --> 00:45:41,651
Quentin has been
with his girlfriend Ashley

862
00:45:41,695 --> 00:45:43,131
for seven years.

863
00:45:43,175 --> 00:45:44,785
Seven years is, like,
normally like, you know,

864
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:47,135
you either say yes or you say no
to, like, life together.

00:45:47,179 --> 00:45:48,484
Seven-year itch.

866
00:45:48,528 --> 00:45:50,225
She's a chef--
she's a vegan chef.

867
00:45:50,269 --> 00:45:52,793
She's always at work,
but tonight Quentin told Ashley

868
00:45:52,837 --> 00:45:55,448
that they were having
a date night and so

869
00:45:55,491 --> 00:45:57,450
we're going to make
that date night really,

870
00:45:57,493 --> 00:46:00,235
really memorable.
So now, earlier today

871
00:46:00,279 --> 00:46:02,455
Ashley and Quentin
were picked up in a car.

872
00:46:02,498 --> 00:46:05,110
And they came to this park,
to Griffith Park,

873
00:46:05,153 --> 00:46:07,199
and at the bottom of the hill
down there they've been

874
00:46:07,242 --> 00:46:09,592
having a beautiful picnic
pretty much all day.

875
00:46:09,636 --> 00:46:11,769
Quentin told Ashley that he's
planned a small surprise to

876
00:46:11,812 --> 00:46:15,511
celebrate the fact that she just
got her first big catering job.

877
00:46:15,555 --> 00:46:17,078
Also, I love a surprise.

878
00:46:17,122 --> 00:46:19,515
Also love dress-up.
Right, so she--

879
00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:21,996
blindfolded her--
bit kinky but you know--

880
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,129
and he's given her
noise-canceling headphones

881
00:46:24,172 --> 00:46:27,349
so that she can't hear what
we've been doing up here,

882
00:46:27,393 --> 00:46:29,003
this concert tonight.

883
00:46:29,047 --> 00:46:30,439
And even though
they're in the area,

884
00:46:30,483 --> 00:46:32,180
she has absolutely no idea
where she is

885
00:46:32,224 --> 00:46:35,357
or where she's going, so...

886
00:46:35,401 --> 00:46:38,099
I need every single person
to be really bloody quiet.

887
00:46:38,143 --> 00:46:39,797
All right?

888
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,276

889
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,452

If you, if you

890
00:46:43,496 --> 00:46:44,845

I'm going to kill you.

very much there

with him at the gym.

So then I-I picked it up
every day and then

1030
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:31,311
I had nothing else to do,
and I think

1031

1037
00:54:42,801 --> 00:54:44,455
Okay, 1:00 p.m. I'm going
to go for a hike.

1038
00:54:44,498 --> 00:54:47,371
You know, having these
sort of pins in my day

1039
00:54:47,414 --> 00:54:49,329
-helped me keep myself together.
-So you weren't even

1040
00:54:49,373 --> 00:54:51,288
starting out
trying to lose weight?

1041
00:54:51,331 --> 00:54:52,593
No, not at all.

1042
00:54:52,637 --> 00:54:54,682
I wasn't bothered
about that at all but...

1043
00:54:54,726 --> 00:54:58,338
in that process of having, you
know, lost all of that weight,

1044
00:54:58,382 --> 00:55:00,732
I definitely
really contributed towards

1045
00:55:00,775 --> 00:55:02,124
me getting my mind right,
you know.

1046
00:55:02,168 --> 00:55:03,865
-It did.
-And giving me the-- absolutely.

1047
00:55:03,909 --> 00:55:05,171
It sharpened everything.

1048
00:55:05,214 --> 00:55:06,433
Without a shadow of a doubt.

1049
00:55:06,477 --> 00:55:08,348
Like, it gave me real purpose.

1050
00:55:08,392 --> 00:55:10,698
Interesting, because you know,
I-I've been through this a few

1051
00:55:10,742 --> 00:55:13,353
times myself and I remember
the first time I dropped,

1052
00:55:13,397 --> 00:55:16,617
you know, a lot of weight--
I think it was like 67 pounds--

1053
00:55:16,661 --> 00:55:18,837
people were really upset
and had stuff to say.

1054
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,274
And it actually in many ways
felt like I had abandoned them

1055
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,494
-or something.
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

1056
00:55:23,537 --> 00:55:26,584
And lots of people
are talking about your weight

1057
00:55:26,627 --> 00:55:28,542
and all in your business
about it.

1058
00:55:28,586 --> 00:55:30,022
-Yeah.
-And I want to know,

1059
00:55:30,065 --> 00:55:31,806
what is the experience
of losing this

1060
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:34,809
been like for you and also
people's reaction to it?

1061
00:55:34,853 --> 00:55:38,422
I'm not shocked or even
fazed by it because

1062
00:55:38,465 --> 00:55:40,815
my body has been objectified
my entire career.

1063
00:55:40,859 --> 00:55:42,817
I'm either too big,
I'm either too small.

1064
00:55:42,861 --> 00:55:44,558
Like, you know, I'm either
hot or I'm either not--

1065
00:55:44,602 --> 00:55:46,430
like, whatever.
I never looked up to anyone

1066
00:55:46,473 --> 00:55:48,040
because of their body.

1067
00:55:48,083 --> 00:55:51,173
You know, I never admired
anyone because they had

1068
00:55:51,217 --> 00:55:53,828
the same hair color as me
or the same style as me.

1069
00:55:53,872 --> 00:55:55,830
-Or, you know, whatever, so...
-Or were the same weight as you.

1070
00:55:55,874 --> 00:55:57,832
Never. Never, ever, ever.

1071
00:55:57,876 --> 00:55:59,878
And when you were heavier,
you were fine.

1072
00:55:59,921 --> 00:56:01,401
I was and I was
body positive then

1073
00:56:01,445 --> 00:56:02,881
and I'm body positive now.

1074
00:56:02,924 --> 00:56:05,492
But it's not my job to
validate how people feel

1075
00:56:05,536 --> 00:56:07,233
-about their bodies.
-Whoo.

1076
00:56:07,276 --> 00:56:10,149
And I feel bad that, you know,
it's made anyone feel

1077
00:56:10,192 --> 00:56:12,369
horrible about themselves,
but I--

1078
00:56:12,412 --> 00:56:15,589
that's not my job
and I-I can't...

1079
00:56:15,633 --> 00:56:17,243
I'm trying to sort
my own life out.

1080
00:56:17,286 --> 00:56:19,114
-You know, I can't...
-[laughs]

1081
00:56:19,158 --> 00:56:21,247
I can't add another worry and
another thing to try and nail.

1082
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:23,380
-I can't, like, you know?
-Okay.

1083
00:56:23,423 --> 00:56:24,990
-And...
-I got that, I love that.

1084
00:56:25,033 --> 00:56:26,513
-Yeah.
-I love that. I love that.

1085
00:56:26,557 --> 00:56:28,341
And, you know, my-my weight
might fluctuate

1086
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:29,777
now that I can't work out as
much and I'm on set all day.

1087
00:56:29,821 --> 00:56:31,431
You know, I mean, I'm eating.

1088
00:56:31,475 --> 00:56:33,215
But I don't care if
I put on weight.

1089
00:56:33,259 --> 00:56:34,739
I don't care if I lose it again.
Like, it's not about that.

1090
00:56:34,782 --> 00:56:37,306
As long as, like,
my muscle memory doesn't go

1091
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:39,613
for when I'm lifting my weights,
which is,

1092
00:56:39,657 --> 00:56:41,398
like my favorite place to be.

1093
00:56:41,441 --> 00:56:43,487
-Lifting weights? Okay.
-I love it.

1094
00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:46,446
-I love it. I love it.
-What's the highest
weight you can press now?

1095
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:48,143
Well, at the moment,
my back's been bad,

1096
00:56:48,187 --> 00:56:49,841
but last summer when
I was at my--

1097
00:56:49,884 --> 00:56:51,886
I was at my peak
of being able to like--

1098
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:53,714
I felt like I could
have been in the Olympics.

1099
00:56:53,758 --> 00:56:55,237
I remember saying to my trainers
all the time, "I'm gonna get,

1100
00:56:55,281 --> 00:56:57,065
I'm gonna get an Olympic
gold medal next."

1101
00:56:57,109 --> 00:56:58,676
-I was like, you know.
-[laughs]

1102
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:00,852
It was-- we were getting to,
like, on a deadlift,

1103
00:57:00,895 --> 00:57:04,377
we were getting up to,
like, 160, 170.

1104
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:05,944
Yeah, I love it.

1105
00:57:05,987 --> 00:57:08,294
But it started out
at ten pounds.

1106
00:57:08,337 --> 00:57:10,731
It started at ten pounds when
I first started lifting.

1107
00:57:10,775 --> 00:57:12,472
I am... Wow.

1108
00:57:12,516 --> 00:57:14,474
Oh, no, I'm--
I'm an athlete.

1109
00:57:14,518 --> 00:57:17,651
I'm actually an athlete.
Like, I'm not even boasting.

1110
00:57:17,695 --> 00:57:19,436
Even the proportions of my body.

1111
00:57:19,479 --> 00:57:21,481
I should have been an athlete,
if only at school

1112
00:57:21,525 --> 00:57:23,178
hadn't discovered boys
and someone had told me

1113
00:57:23,222 --> 00:57:25,572
to go and do a bit more P.E.

1114
00:57:25,616 --> 00:57:28,314
Wow. 160, wow.

1115
00:57:28,357 --> 00:57:30,098
Yeah. I love it.

1116
00:57:30,142 --> 00:57:31,317
But I have to eat
quite a lot of food

1117
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:32,666
to lift the weights I lift.

1118
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:34,407
-So you eat?
-I eat.

1119
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:35,669
-Oh, yeah.
-What you want to eat?

1120
00:57:35,713 --> 00:57:37,236
-I had Chinese last night.
-Okay.

1121
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:38,759
Yeah, we found the best
McDonald's recently.

1122
00:57:38,803 --> 00:57:40,021
It's piping hot every time.

1123
00:57:40,065 --> 00:57:41,632
[laughs]

1124
00:57:41,675 --> 00:57:43,634
No, I do. I love it.
I just, I'm not--

1125
00:57:43,677 --> 00:57:45,070
I ain't got much
of a sweet tooth though.

1126
00:57:45,113 --> 00:57:46,288
Yeah, I don't either.
Yeah, yeah.

1127
00:57:46,332 --> 00:57:47,594
I'd rather a sandwich.

1128
00:57:47,638 --> 00:57:49,683
Deadlifting 160, this girl.

1129
00:57:49,727 --> 00:57:51,206
-Yeah.
-She's an athlete.

1130
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:52,686
I'm also a very good boxer.

1131
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:54,340
I've got a left hook that
could kill you.

1132
00:57:54,383 --> 00:57:55,907
-OPRAH: Really?
-ADELE: Oh, yeah.

1133
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:57,038
-Yeah, I'm a very good boxer.
-I'd be scared.

1134
00:57:57,082 --> 00:57:58,866
[both laughing]

1135
00:58:03,915 --> 00:58:05,873
OPRAH: Another new song on
the album is titled "Hold On."

1136
00:58:05,917 --> 00:58:07,614
The lyrics to this song
are so brutally honest.

1137
00:58:07,658 --> 00:58:09,486
Sounds like you were
in the dark,

1138
00:58:09,529 --> 00:58:11,357
-dark, dark hours there.
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

1139
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:12,706
"I swear to God," you say,

1140
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:14,534
"I'm such a mess.

1141
00:58:14,578 --> 00:58:17,537
"The harder that I try,
I regress.

1142
00:58:17,581 --> 00:58:20,235
"I am my own worst enemy.

1143
00:58:20,279 --> 00:58:22,760
"Right now I truly hate
being me.

1144
00:58:22,803 --> 00:58:25,806
"Every day feels like the road
I'm on might just open up

1145
00:58:25,850 --> 00:58:27,634
"and swallow me whole.

1146
00:58:27,678 --> 00:58:30,376
"How do I feel so mighty small
when I'm struggling

1147
00:58:30,419 --> 00:58:32,552
to feel at all?"

1148
00:58:32,596 --> 00:58:33,988
-Mm.
-Girl, you can write.

1149
00:58:34,032 --> 00:58:35,207
Oh! Thank you.

1150
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:36,817
-You can write.
-Thank you.

1151
00:58:36,861 --> 00:58:39,777
So what was going on there?
What was happening?

1152
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:43,171
How did you keep the faith when
you were at your lowest point?

1153
00:58:43,215 --> 00:58:44,782
-What were you holding on to?
-My friends.

1154
00:58:44,825 --> 00:58:46,784
The question is,
what were you holding on to?

1155
00:58:46,827 --> 00:58:49,264
Um, my-my friends
always would say,

1156
00:58:49,308 --> 00:58:51,179
"hold on" when I would feel like

1157
00:58:51,223 --> 00:58:53,007
how I'm-- you know,
the lyrics in the verse.

1158
00:58:53,051 --> 00:58:56,576
-Mm-hmm.
-But it was just exhausting,

1159
00:58:56,620 --> 00:59:01,450
trying to... to-to,
like, keep going with it.

1160
00:59:01,494 --> 00:59:03,583
It's a process, you know;
the process

1161
00:59:03,627 --> 00:59:06,934
of-of a divorce;
the process of, you know,

1162
00:59:06,978 --> 00:59:09,415
being a single parent;
the process of not

1163
00:59:09,458 --> 00:59:10,851
seeing your child
every single day

1164
00:59:10,895 --> 00:59:12,374
wasn't really a plan that I had

1165
00:59:12,418 --> 00:59:14,594
when I, you know, when I,
when I became a mum;

1166
00:59:14,638 --> 00:59:17,554
um, the process of arriving for
yourself every single day,

1167
00:59:17,597 --> 00:59:19,556
turning up for yourself
every single day

1168
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:21,296
and still running a home,
running a business.

1169
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:23,211
Like, it's-it's, you know,
so many people

1170
00:59:23,255 --> 00:59:25,170
know what I'm talking about
and it can--

1171
00:59:25,213 --> 00:59:26,693
you know,
I feel like that as well.

1172
00:59:26,737 --> 00:59:28,739
I-I juggle those things as well.

1173
00:59:28,782 --> 00:59:32,307
And it just-- I felt like
not doing it anymore,

1174
00:59:32,351 --> 00:59:34,658
and also trying to, like,

1175
00:59:34,701 --> 00:59:38,487
move forward, like...

1176
00:59:38,531 --> 00:59:40,925
but, like, with intention,

1177
00:59:40,968 --> 00:59:43,710
not just trying to get out of it
for no reason.

1178
00:59:43,754 --> 00:59:46,278
It made my feet hurt, walking
through all of that concrete.

1179
00:59:46,321 --> 00:59:49,107
[laughs]

1180
00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:51,631
I never, I never questioned
whether I'd made a bad decision.

1181
00:59:51,675 --> 00:59:53,633
I never ever did,
which I'm very grateful for,

1182
00:59:53,677 --> 00:59:55,635
that I never asked myself
those questions.

1183
00:59:55,679 --> 00:59:58,507
But it was just like maybe it
would have been better

1184
00:59:58,551 --> 01:00:01,336
had I just kept my mouth shut,
you know, and carried on.

1185
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:03,338
-Mm.
-You know, just in terms

1186
01:00:03,382 --> 01:00:04,992
of hurting two people
that I love

1187
01:00:05,036 --> 01:00:07,038

this is what I say to
all my girls in school--

1269
01:06:22,935 --> 01:06:25,546
that whatever the biggest
wound of your life is

1270
01:06:25,590 --> 01:06:29,811
from your parents, that you
end up choosing relationships

1271

to try to heal those wounds.

1272
01:06:31,683 --> 01:06:34,816
-Yeah.
-So what do you think
the deep wound

1273
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:37,123
from the past,
from you as a little girl

1274
01:06:37,167 --> 01:06:39,996
growing up,
you're trying to heal as you

1275
01:06:40,039 --> 01:06:42,694
reach for your relationships
as an adult woman?

1276
01:06:42,737 --> 01:06:47,568
My dad's absolute lack
of presence and effort with me.

1277
01:06:47,612 --> 01:06:49,440
But you know, as I got older,

1278
01:06:49,483 --> 01:06:51,442
I definitely understood
that it was the alcohol.

1279
01:06:51,485 --> 01:06:54,053
It wasn't a choice that he was
necessarily making in himself

1280
01:06:54,097 --> 01:06:55,576
that he didn't want to
step up for me.

1281
01:06:55,620 --> 01:06:57,535
But when you're little,
you don't know that.

1282
01:06:57,578 --> 01:06:59,319
-Especially when he's like,
"I'm drinking juice."
-Yes.

1283
01:06:59,363 --> 01:07:01,104
So I'm like,
"Well, I drink juice."

1284
01:07:01,147 --> 01:07:02,931
Like, you know, you don't know
the sort of effects of it.

1285
01:07:02,975 --> 01:07:04,890
But yeah, like,
when someone that you

1286
01:07:04,933 --> 01:07:07,066
love so much, and the more
that you feel like

1287
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:09,590
they don't love you,
you love them even more...

1288
01:07:09,634 --> 01:07:12,245
Like, I was definitely always
trying to fill that void.

1289
01:07:12,289 --> 01:07:16,684
But at the same time, I would
expect it to hurt at some point.

1290
01:07:16,728 --> 01:07:19,252
So I would hurt them first.

1291
01:07:19,296 --> 01:07:21,602
You know,
not in a malicious way.

1292
01:07:21,646 --> 01:07:23,517
It wasn't malicious,
it was just like I had

1293
01:07:23,561 --> 01:07:25,258
absolutely zero expectations
of anybody.

1294
01:07:25,302 --> 01:07:26,955
Because I never-- I learned not
to have them from my dad.

1295
01:07:26,999 --> 01:07:29,088
Because you'd been let down
so many times.

1296
01:07:29,132 --> 01:07:31,830
Yeah, so by having, you know,
zero expectations,

1297
01:07:31,873 --> 01:07:34,093
I wouldn't
arrive for them either.

1298
01:07:34,137 --> 01:07:36,356
Like, you know,
and I would feed off this energy

1299
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:39,446
so they'd be like,
well, why would I, like...

1300
01:07:39,490 --> 01:07:42,319
like, make-- go beyond
and make that effort with you

1301
01:07:42,362 --> 01:07:44,451
when A] you don't seem
to want me to;

1302
01:07:44,495 --> 01:07:46,323
and B] you're not doing it.
Like, you know?

1303
01:07:46,366 --> 01:07:49,413
Um, so it was definitely...
definitely that.

1304
01:07:49,456 --> 01:07:51,241
And then during the-the,
you know,

1305
01:07:51,284 --> 01:07:53,417
the sort of the last two,
three years of my life,

1306
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:55,419
my dad got really sick.

1307
01:07:55,462 --> 01:07:59,640
And it was interesting
that that...

1308
01:07:59,684 --> 01:08:02,382
happened during-- after,
just after having left

1309
01:08:02,426 --> 01:08:04,776
my marriage when I had already
made the conscious decision

1310
01:08:04,819 --> 01:08:07,953
to get to know myself
and figure some things out.

1311
01:08:07,996 --> 01:08:11,913
And... not-not-not
that long ago,

1312
01:08:11,957 --> 01:08:14,960
it was, um, back in April.

1313
01:08:15,003 --> 01:08:16,483
When he-- when my dad died

1314
01:08:16,527 --> 01:08:19,834
and we had our peace together,
I felt that...

1315
01:08:19,878 --> 01:08:22,446
that huge gaping hole fill,
like, you know?

1316
01:08:22,489 --> 01:08:24,970
-Really?
-Just, we-we-we forgave
each other.

1317
01:08:25,013 --> 01:08:26,841
'Cause, you know,
I said hurtful things.

1318
01:08:26,885 --> 01:08:28,930
I did-- I did nothing as bad
as what he did though,

1319
01:08:28,974 --> 01:08:30,497
to be honest with you.
Like, you know, if you add it

1320
01:08:30,541 --> 01:08:32,064
all up throughout my whole life.

1321
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:33,239
But I definitely, like,
snapped in the press

1322
01:08:33,283 --> 01:08:35,023
and stuff like that at him,

1323
01:08:35,067 --> 01:08:37,156
which definitely hurt
his feelings, of course.

1324
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,941
Um, but we
found our peace together.

1325
01:08:39,985 --> 01:08:41,160
And then...

1326
01:08:41,204 --> 01:08:42,640
You played the album for him.

1327
01:08:42,683 --> 01:08:44,685
Played the album too,
on Zoom, yeah. Yeah.

1328
01:08:44,729 --> 01:08:47,166
Was that healing
for both of you?

1329
01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:48,689
-Yeah.
-What did you learn from that?

1330
01:08:48,733 --> 01:08:51,388
When we met up
and when I heard he was ill,

1331
01:08:51,431 --> 01:08:53,912
um, I went to go
and see him in Wales,

1332
01:08:53,955 --> 01:08:56,262
and I wanted to play him
"To Be Loved."

1333
01:08:56,306 --> 01:09:00,310
My main goal in life is
to be loved and love,

1334
01:09:00,353 --> 01:09:02,050
you know, and so I wanted
to play it to my dad

1335
01:09:02,094 --> 01:09:03,791
being like, "You're the reason
I haven't done that yet."

1336
01:09:03,835 --> 01:09:05,445
'Cause he definitely was
the reason.

1337
01:09:05,489 --> 01:09:07,534
He was the reason I haven't
fully accessed what it is

1338
01:09:07,578 --> 01:09:10,972
to be, like, in a loving, loving
relationship with somebody.

1339
01:09:11,016 --> 01:09:12,670
-Like, 360, like, you know.
-Mm-hmm.

1340
01:09:12,713 --> 01:09:14,280
And he couldn't.

1341
01:09:14,324 --> 01:09:15,977
He was like, "I've only ever
heard 'Hometown Glory.'"

1342
01:09:16,021 --> 01:09:18,023
So I'm like, what? That's
the first song I ever wrote

1343
01:09:18,066 --> 01:09:19,720
when I was, like, 16.

1344
01:09:19,764 --> 01:09:22,549
And he was like, "It's
too painful," like, you know.

1345
01:09:22,593 --> 01:09:24,812
-He's never heard anything other
than "Hometown..."
-He would never listen.

1346
01:09:24,856 --> 01:09:26,336
He would switch it off
and he never ever

1347
01:09:26,379 --> 01:09:28,207
played any of my other music,
he said.

1348
01:09:28,251 --> 01:09:30,470
So I forced him to listen

1349
01:09:30,514 --> 01:09:32,298
and it's like we both cried
and stuff like that,

1350
01:09:32,342 --> 01:09:36,346
and then, um, so that--
him sort of really

1351
01:09:36,389 --> 01:09:38,652
understanding my child wound
through my song

1352
01:09:38,696 --> 01:09:40,437
was amazing for me.

1353
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:42,265
And again, I think he
could listen to me sing it

1354
01:09:42,308 --> 01:09:44,789
but not say it. Yeah,
we're very similar like that.

1355
01:09:44,832 --> 01:09:47,444
And then when I played him
the album,

1356
01:09:47,487 --> 01:09:50,577
it was just, by then
he'd listened to all of 19,

1357
01:09:50,621 --> 01:09:52,840
all of 21,all of 25,
and my mum was helping to look

1358
01:09:52,884 --> 01:09:54,886
after him
towards the end as well.

1359
01:09:54,929 --> 01:09:58,890
And his favorites were
all of my favorites,

1360
01:09:58,933 --> 01:10:01,458
you know, which I thought
was amazing and...

1361
01:10:01,501 --> 01:10:04,852
he wished that he'd done
what I had been doing.

1362
01:10:04,896 --> 01:10:07,072
For myself, you know?
Like, the journey.

1363
01:10:07,115 --> 01:10:09,030
-Working on himself. Yeah.
The journey.
-Yeah. He wished he'd done it.

1364
01:10:09,074 --> 01:10:12,120
-Yeah.
-Yeah. And he was proud of me
for doing it, so it was,

1365
01:10:12,164 --> 01:10:15,036
it was very, very healing.
But when he died,

1366
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:17,256
it was just, it was,
it literally, it was...

it was like the wound closed up.

And I've been so open, you know.

1369
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:22,740
Didn't your therapist
at one point

1370
01:10:22,783 --> 01:10:25,264
say you need to sit with
a seven-year-old Adele?

1371
01:10:25,308 --> 01:10:27,135
-Yeah.
-And when you did that, sat with

1372
01:10:27,179 --> 01:10:28,267
the seven-year-old Adele...

1373
01:10:28,311 --> 01:10:30,269
-Yeah.
-What did you find?

1374
01:10:30,313 --> 01:10:32,706
Um...

No, yeah, it was.
It was.

you know,

1381

she was willing, willing.

1382
01:10:48,505 --> 01:10:51,899
-Willing to get out and run.
-Look at what she did.

1383
01:10:51,943 --> 01:10:53,684
-Look at what she did.
-I said I wouldn't
stay in there.

1384
01:10:53,727 --> 01:10:55,033
-Yeah.
-I said that when I was little.

1385

-Look at what she did.
-I was like,

sent to the wrong place."

in this chair right now.

all the things that you did

-No.

Rich Paul?

1490
01:15:57,944 --> 01:16:00,686
I met him at a birthday party.
We were on the dance floor.

1491
01:16:00,730 --> 01:16:03,297
And I met him and then a
couple of-- couple years later,

1492
01:16:03,341 --> 01:16:05,561
we went out for dinner, which
he says was a business meeting.

01:16:05,604 --> 01:16:07,606
I'm like,
a business meeting about what?

1494
01:16:07,650 --> 01:16:09,608
We wouldn't be having a meeting
about business.

1495
01:16:09,652 --> 01:16:11,610
And then it was just
the first time

1496
01:16:11,654 --> 01:16:13,177
we'd hung out only on our own,

1497
01:16:13,220 --> 01:16:14,613
and not with other friends
and stuff like that.

1498
01:16:14,657 --> 01:16:16,354

01:16:16,397 --> 01:16:17,703
I think that's how people
would normally meet each other

-Mm-hmm.

It's just, it's just timing.

-Mm-hmm.
-It's just timing,
but it'll be interesting to see

in general to anything that

1525
01:17:20,026 --> 01:17:22,376

-And I'm talking outside

Do you think you'll be able to
write from a happy space?

1532
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:35,694
Well, I hope so.

1533
01:17:35,738 --> 01:17:37,696
-I hope so, you know.
-Mm-hmm.

1534
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:39,002
But the music will change?

1535
01:17:39,045 --> 01:17:41,134
Like...

1536
01:17:41,178 --> 01:17:43,920
Like, "Love Is," like, you know,
the last song on the album?

1537
01:17:43,963 --> 01:17:46,009
-"Love is a Game."
-Yeah, it's about love.

1538
01:17:46,052 --> 01:17:48,141
Here's some of the lyrics.

1539
01:17:48,185 --> 01:17:50,143
"Love is a game
for fools to play

1540
01:17:50,187 --> 01:17:52,537
"and I ain't fooling.
What a cruel thing

1541
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:54,757
to self-inflict that pain."

1542
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:57,368
And I wanted to know,
are you, Adele,

1543
01:17:57,411 --> 01:18:02,590
getting better at this game
of love?

1544
01:18:02,634 --> 01:18:04,897
Yeah, I think so because
I don't, I don't, um,

1545
01:18:04,941 --> 01:18:06,682
I don't treat it
like a game anymore.

1546
01:18:06,725 --> 01:18:08,379
You know, that thing of like,
you're gonna hurt me

1547
01:18:08,422 --> 01:18:09,423
so I'm gonna hurt you first.
I certainly,

1548
01:18:09,467 --> 01:18:11,077
I'm not like that anymore.

1549
01:18:11,121 --> 01:18:13,253
You know, one of the things
I think is so valuable

1550
01:18:13,297 --> 01:18:15,734
in knowing how to move forward
in your life

1551
01:18:15,778 --> 01:18:19,477
is having clarity on what
it is you really want.

1552
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:20,870
Mm-hmm.

1553
01:18:20,913 --> 01:18:22,480
-And when you...
-And what you like.

1554
01:18:22,523 --> 01:18:24,003
Yes, and what you like,
but mostly

1555
01:18:24,047 --> 01:18:26,832
knowing in the spirit and soul
of yourself

1556
01:18:26,876 --> 01:18:28,181
what is it you really want

1557
01:18:28,225 --> 01:18:29,835
because that's how
you start to--

1558
01:18:29,879 --> 01:18:31,707
-drawing that to yourself.
-Yeah.

1559
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:34,057
And do you know what that is,
ultimately?

1560
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:37,103
What do you really want?

1561
01:18:37,147 --> 01:18:38,975
-Peace of mind.
-Just peace of mind?

1562
01:18:39,018 --> 01:18:40,193
-Just peace of mind.
-Okay.

1563
01:18:40,237 --> 01:18:42,761
Um, and stability, but I can--

1564
01:18:42,805 --> 01:18:45,155
I don't have to expect someone
else to give me stability.

1565
01:18:45,198 --> 01:18:47,679
I can also be stable for myself.

1566
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:50,116
Be a solid house that doesn't
blow over in a storm.

1567
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:52,771
Mm-hmm. Well, the best thing you
said here in this interview,

1568
01:18:52,815 --> 01:18:54,555
as far as I'm concerned, is that

1569
01:18:54,599 --> 01:18:58,255
now you're in a relationship
where, for the first time,

1570
01:18:58,298 --> 01:19:00,866
-your love for yourself
comes first.
-Yeah.

1571
01:19:00,910 --> 01:19:03,564
And all great things come
after that. I know that.

1572
01:19:03,608 --> 01:19:05,915
A quote I heard as well
while on my journey was:

1573
01:19:05,958 --> 01:19:07,220
"If you're not feeling
everything,

1574
01:19:07,264 --> 01:19:08,265
you're missing everything."

1575
01:19:08,308 --> 01:19:10,615
That sort of gave me permission.

1576
01:19:10,658 --> 01:19:12,182
Mm-hmm.

1577
01:19:12,225 --> 01:19:13,661
To really do that
during the process.

1578
01:19:13,705 --> 01:19:15,489
-Yeah. Yeah.
-You know? And not be upset.

1579
01:19:15,533 --> 01:19:18,188
This has been great. Thanks
for coming to the rose garden.

1580
01:19:18,231 --> 01:19:19,711
I can't believe we just
had a chat.

1581
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:21,191

-We had a little chat.

-It's gonna be so great.
-I hope you like it. Yeah.

1585
01:19:26,631 --> 01:19:28,938
And I wish you all the things
your heart desires.

1586
01:19:28,981 --> 01:19:31,070

-That's my prayer for you.
