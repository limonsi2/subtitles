3
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:44,504
You ready?

4
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:50,944
Come on.

5
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:54,247
Do I have to do this?

6
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:55,750
A family wants you, Ben.

7
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,685
I really thought
you'd be excited.

8
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:00,187
I mean, I'm almost 18,
can I just stay here?

9
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,889
No, you can't, you need a home.

10
00:02:01,923 --> 00:02:03,091
No, I don't.

11
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,761
Look Ben, there's four other
kids there just like you.

12
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:09,597
Mr magdalena's gonna be
a great foster parent

13
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:11,799
and he's someone you
can really trust,

14
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,901
can't you just try
to give him a chance?

15
00:02:16,671 --> 00:02:17,805
Okay, come on, let's go.

16
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:26,581
Sam?

17
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:27,614
Yeah.

18
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,753
Ben, this is mr magdalena.

19
00:02:31,786 --> 00:02:32,854
You can call me Sam.

20
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,390
It's Benny, right?

21
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:37,692
Just Ben.

22
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:39,326
Right, just Ben.

23
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:41,562
Oh yeah.

24
00:02:41,596 --> 00:02:43,196
Thank you.

25
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,165
Should be good to go.

26
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:49,570
Look, I understand this
is kind of happening fast,

27
00:02:49,604 --> 00:02:52,372
and it's gonna take a minute
to get used to things.

28
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:53,406
Yeah.

29
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:55,786
You of course, you
don't have to call me dad

30
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,177
or anything like that.

31
00:02:59,279 --> 00:02:59,981
Yeah.

32
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:01,014
I get that you're older.

33
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:03,315
Thanks.

34
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,655
Well, it looks like
I got everything,

35
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:09,289
you guys are all set.

36
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:10,322
Great.

37
00:03:11,893 --> 00:03:14,494
Well, let's take you home.

38
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:16,731
Sure, yeah.

39
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:24,404
Hey Sam, don't
worry, he'll do great.

40
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:25,438
Thanks.

41
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:33,966
I heard you got quite the
record of running away.

42
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,520
If you don't wanna
talk, it's fine.

43
00:03:39,554 --> 00:03:43,958
I'm sorry, I just kind
of prefer to be alone.

44
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:45,892
I get that.

45
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:50,898
My wife, Evelyn, she
used to be like that too.

46
00:03:53,034 --> 00:03:56,838
She also grew up in the
whole foster system.

47
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:03,376
Didn't have the best
experience to say the least.

48
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:09,917
But yeah, after we
met, we got together,

49
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:16,824
we wanted to start a family and
wanted to give back somehow,

50
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:21,294
then we thought
becoming foster parents,

51
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,631
it's kind of the best scenario.

52
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:29,537
It's just me now though,

53
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:33,508
it's been that way for
the past six months.

54
00:04:37,812 --> 00:04:39,056
You're gonna love
the group though,

55
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,651
let me tell you, those
kids are a cracker.

56
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:45,987
They're a handful,
but you'll love them.

57
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:51,959
And you are just in
time to help us unload.

58
00:05:21,856 --> 00:05:23,524
Hey Sam, is that the new kid?

59
00:05:23,558 --> 00:05:25,059
Yup, this is Ben.

60
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:27,628
Hey man.

61
00:05:27,662 --> 00:05:28,863
Hey, hi.

62
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:30,598
Come here.

63
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,811
Why don't you give
him a tour, Rick,

64
00:05:33,835 --> 00:05:34,845
show him around the
house and all that.

65
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:35,703
Come back once you're done.

66
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:36,736
Sure thing.

67
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:39,774
So, welcome home.

68
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:40,775
Thanks.

69
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:42,743
Do you get any more
bags or stuff, I can-

70
00:05:42,777 --> 00:05:43,911
- this is all I have.

71
00:05:43,945 --> 00:05:45,546
Cool, just before
we go in though,

72
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,115
I just need to talk to
you about something,

73
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:49,584
pineapple or no pineapple?

74
00:05:51,118 --> 00:05:52,452
I'm sorry?

75
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,121
Pineapple or no
pineapple on pizza.

76
00:05:54,155 --> 00:05:55,866
This is just an determine
whether we make you

77
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,959
sleep outside for the
first night or not.

78
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:03,598
Ben, it's a joke.

79
00:06:03,631 --> 00:06:06,601
We're not that cruel, but we
are gonna get pizza later,

80
00:06:06,634 --> 00:06:07,845
I was thinking
pineapples, no pineapples?

81
00:06:07,869 --> 00:06:10,470
Sorry, no, no, no
pineapple on pizza.

82
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:11,505
Good man, come on.

83
00:06:13,608 --> 00:06:15,576
Hey, ozzy, comes say
hi to the new kid.

84
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:19,117
You're the kid who
runs away a lot, right?

85
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:21,481
I guess, yeah.

86
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:22,750
Well, that's good.

87
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,762
Means we don't got to
worry about you for long.

88
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:28,956
Jeez, ozzy, at least pretend
not to be a dick for a bit.

89
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:29,824
Hey man.

90
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:31,559
Yeah, whatever.

91
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:32,727
I mean, why?

92
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,427
It's nice to see a
new face around here.

93
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:35,096
Plus it be good to
have extra help-

94
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:36,496
- we're doing just fine.

95
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:43,871
Don't mind him, oz,
he's always like that.

96
00:06:43,905 --> 00:06:44,982
Oh well, don't
think I'm gonna have

97
00:06:45,006 --> 00:06:46,908
much trouble remembering him.

98
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:48,509
That was Morgan by the way.

99
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:51,178
Oh yeah, she seems cool.

100
00:06:51,212 --> 00:06:53,547
And do not get on her bad side.

101
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:56,416
Ozzy will be the least of
your problems if that happens.

102
00:06:57,685 --> 00:06:58,685
Come on.

103
00:07:05,226 --> 00:07:06,560
That's pretty cool, huh?

104
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:08,663
Oh, yeah.

105
00:07:08,696 --> 00:07:10,064
There's a room upstairs for you.

106
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,110
Well.

107
00:07:28,182 --> 00:07:29,583
Hey Rick.

108
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:30,685
Yeah.

109
00:07:30,718 --> 00:07:31,718
Who's that?

110
00:07:32,753 --> 00:07:35,556
Oh, that's just Bella,
she's the new kid before you.

111
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:37,758
She likes to be alone
a lot, now she's cool.

112
00:07:45,266 --> 00:07:46,266
There you go.

113
00:07:50,738 --> 00:07:52,740
We didn't have a mattress.

114
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:53,773
Yeah, I can tell.

115
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:58,221
You and Izzy are the
only ones up here,

116
00:07:58,245 --> 00:08:01,615
so it should be pretty
quiet most of the time.

117
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:05,753
I'll be downstairs.

118
00:08:15,763 --> 00:08:17,264
Oscar, who you texting?

119
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,634
I think his girlfriend.

120
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:21,602
Does he have a girlfriend?

121
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:22,837
I think he has a girlfriend.

122
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,573
I think his date didn't
go well the other night.

123
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:27,742
Ozzy's not said anything.

124
00:08:27,775 --> 00:08:28,743
Hey Ben.

125
00:08:28,776 --> 00:08:30,011
Wanna join?

126
00:08:30,044 --> 00:08:31,979
I just came to get a slice.

127
00:08:32,013 --> 00:08:33,180
Pineapple or no?

128
00:08:33,214 --> 00:08:35,683
I already asked him, he said no.

129
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:37,018
You said no?

130
00:08:37,051 --> 00:08:38,252
Thought you were cool.

131
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,024
Hey Sam.

132
00:08:43,057 --> 00:08:43,891
Hey Sam.

133
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:44,759
Hey Sam.

134
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:45,792
Hey guys.

135
00:08:46,327 --> 00:08:48,562
Hey Ben, warming up to them?

136
00:08:48,596 --> 00:08:49,596
Slowly.

137
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:52,133
Did Isabella come eat?

138
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,801
I'm not sure.

139
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:54,769
Well, if you're headed back up,

140
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:56,637
do you mind taking her a slice?

141
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,671
Yeah, no problem.

142
00:08:58,672 --> 00:08:59,672
Thanks.

143
00:09:03,878 --> 00:09:04,878
Watch your head.

144
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:15,688
Hi.

145
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,223
Hi.

146
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:21,695
I brought you a slice
of pizza if you want it?

147
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:25,266
Oh, I'm not that
hungry, but thanks.

148
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:28,936
All good, I'm sure
one of them will eat it.

149
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:29,969
Most likely.

150
00:09:31,005 --> 00:09:33,340
I'm Isabella, by the way.

151
00:09:33,374 --> 00:09:34,942
I'm so sorry, I'm Ben.

152
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,044
Feel at home yet?

153
00:09:38,813 --> 00:09:40,857
I feel this is the home I
was always meant to be with.

154
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:42,016
Oh really?

155
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:43,784
Yeah, yeah,
just couldn't be better.

156
00:09:43,818 --> 00:09:45,152
Oh, we're that bad, huh?

157
00:09:45,186 --> 00:09:47,655
Well, I don't know about
you yet, we just met.

158
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:50,257
We did, but I can
definitely tell you're lying.

159
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:55,396
It's not what I mean,
you guys seem really cool.

160
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:56,363
It's just-

161
00:09:56,397 --> 00:09:58,099
- hey, I get it can be weird

162
00:09:58,132 --> 00:10:00,167
living with a different
family, we all do.

163
00:10:00,201 --> 00:10:01,702
Yeah, I actually never-

164
00:10:05,406 --> 00:10:06,640
something up there?

165
00:10:08,109 --> 00:10:09,143
There shouldn't be.

166
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:36,837
You got a flashlight?

167
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:50,317
What's all this?

168
00:10:50,351 --> 00:10:52,953
Not ours, whoever
lived here before

169
00:10:52,987 --> 00:10:54,889
must've left it behind.

170
00:10:54,922 --> 00:10:57,057
Oh, just left it behind.

171
00:11:07,301 --> 00:11:09,203
Did you say something?

172
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:10,070
What?

173
00:11:10,104 --> 00:11:11,372
No.

174
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:12,405
Oh.

175
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,080
Did you hear that?

176
00:11:23,217 --> 00:11:24,217
No.

177
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:29,356
It's coming from the-

178
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:42,102
What are you guys doing?

179
00:11:42,136 --> 00:11:43,070
Didn't here you come up.

180
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:44,238
Did I seriously scare you?

181
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:45,806
You kind of did.

182
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:46,983
What's going on up here, guys?

183
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:48,876
That's what I'm
trying to figure out.

184
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:51,912
We heard something up
here, so we decided to look.

185
00:11:51,946 --> 00:11:53,347
And you weren't
gonna tell anyone?

186
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,150
Yeah, I mean, what if
there was a psychopath

187
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:58,118
who's been living
up here for years

188
00:11:58,152 --> 00:12:00,354
and runs through the
walls, eating our food

189
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,723
and just wants to
murder us in our sleep?

190
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:07,895
What kind of horrible
experiences have you had?

191
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:09,964
Okay, I'm just
saying, never know.

192
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:13,901
Okay, what are you looking at?

193
00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:24,945
Yeah, that's not creepy at all.

194
00:12:24,979 --> 00:12:26,780
Who would want that?

195
00:12:26,814 --> 00:12:27,814
I don't know.

196
00:12:29,183 --> 00:12:31,118
Okay, can we actually
get down though,

197
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:32,319
it smells like shit up here?

198
00:12:32,353 --> 00:12:35,322
Just leave that here, please.

199
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:39,960
I guess we'll never know.

200
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:41,894
Come on.

201
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,510
Isabella?

202
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:34,141
Ben, what are you doing?

203
00:14:37,144 --> 00:14:40,347
Were you down here a second ago?

204
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:41,381
No, why?

205
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:45,018
I thought I saw.

206
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:50,457
Why you up anyways?

207
00:14:50,491 --> 00:14:52,993
You weren't exactly quiet.

208
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,026
What are you doing?

209
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:58,098
Nothing, I just found this.

210
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,903
Maybe they were playing
and just left it there.

211
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:07,575
Ben.

212
00:15:07,609 --> 00:15:12,614
What?

213
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:21,321
What the hell are you two doing?

214
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:23,991
I'm sorry, I thought I
left something down here

215
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:26,561
and I asked if she
could help me find it.

216
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:27,961
At 3:00 in the morning.

217
00:15:30,698 --> 00:15:32,698
What could be so important
at three in the morning?

218
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:35,301
Go to bed.

219
00:15:59,627 --> 00:16:03,464
Ben, you need to
eat, come on get up.

220
00:16:03,497 --> 00:16:06,033
Hey Ben, come on, we're
gonna go get breakfast.

221
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,503
Was that really necessary?

222
00:16:08,536 --> 00:16:10,313
Hey, you didn't wake up
the first time we did it.

223
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:11,337
You made me do it.

224
00:16:12,807 --> 00:16:15,476
Okay look, we're all
extremely hungry,

225
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:18,078
and I kind of want
some pancakes,

226
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:21,749
so I'm gonna do what
it takes to get you up.

227
00:16:21,783 --> 00:16:24,284
You're a piece of
shit, you know that?

228
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:26,487
Yeah, come on sleepy head.

229
00:16:43,705 --> 00:16:45,707
Dude, what are you doing?

230
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,107
I'm sorry, I was-

231
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,486
- Rick's losing his
mind, we gotta go.

232
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,510
Where's Izzy?

233
00:16:52,614 --> 00:16:53,648
Speak of the devil.

234
00:16:59,253 --> 00:17:00,253
Come on.

235
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:06,628
Dude, get your ass over here.

236
00:17:06,661 --> 00:17:07,762
I'm sorry.

237
00:17:07,795 --> 00:17:09,405
- I want pancakes.
- I'm coming, I'm sorry.

238
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:10,429
I'm sorry.

239
00:17:15,703 --> 00:17:17,170
So you guys excited to start

240
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:19,507
a new school next week, again?

241
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:22,610
It's been the third move,
so kind of getting used to it.

242
00:17:23,678 --> 00:17:25,245
As long as the
baseball team's good.

243
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:28,115
Yeah, well, try not to get
kicked off the team again,

244
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:28,850
how about that?

245
00:17:28,883 --> 00:17:30,484
The guy wanted his ass kicked.

246
00:17:30,518 --> 00:17:31,653
The way I remember it,

247
00:17:31,686 --> 00:17:34,054
you were the one getting
your handed to you.

248
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:37,257
It was pretty funny.

249
00:17:46,801 --> 00:17:47,801
Isabella.

250
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,373
Ow.

251
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,407
Sorry.

252
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:58,078
Hey, what happened last night?

253
00:17:59,781 --> 00:18:01,181
I don't know.

254
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:02,349
Are you okay?

255
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:03,818
Yes, I'm fine.

256
00:18:03,851 --> 00:18:04,819
You sure?

257
00:18:04,852 --> 00:18:07,487
'Cause you've been in a
pissy mood all morning.

258
00:18:07,522 --> 00:18:10,457
Sorry Izzy, but I gotta
agree with him, what's wrong?

259
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,794
That doll didn't scare
you that bad, did it?

260
00:18:12,827 --> 00:18:14,261
What doll?

261
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:16,731
They found a doll in
the attic yesterday.

262
00:18:16,764 --> 00:18:18,866
Scariest shit
I've ever seen, man.

263
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,735
You're scared of a toy?

264
00:18:20,768 --> 00:18:23,337
Yeah a toy that probably
belonged to a demon.

265
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,872
Where's this doll now?

266
00:18:24,906 --> 00:18:26,406
Still up there, right?

267
00:18:27,374 --> 00:18:29,109
Yeah, I think so.

268
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,747
Well, we should clear
that space out today anyway.

269
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,448
Maybe there's some Bible stuff.

270
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:36,216
It's probably
all worthless, Sam.

271
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:38,753
Well, we don't know
that until we look, huh?

272
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:48,896
I don't think any of this is
gonna be worth anything, Sam.

273
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,565
Probably not.

274
00:18:50,598 --> 00:18:53,333
Hey, you never know, we
could end up getting lucky.

275
00:18:57,672 --> 00:18:58,840
Izzy-

276
00:18:58,873 --> 00:19:00,775
- if you're gonna ask me
if I'm okay, I'm fine.

277
00:19:00,808 --> 00:19:04,277
Look, I know we met
literally last night,

278
00:19:05,212 --> 00:19:06,547
but I can tell you're lying.

279
00:19:07,982 --> 00:19:08,982
What did you see?

280
00:19:10,384 --> 00:19:12,854
Whatever it was, I'm
sure it wasn't real.

281
00:19:12,887 --> 00:19:13,921
Okay, so can we drop it?

282
00:19:13,955 --> 00:19:15,255
Drop it?

283
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:15,923
You're look like you're
about to pass out.

284
00:19:15,957 --> 00:19:17,257
I said drop it, Ben.

285
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:23,429
Whoops.

286
00:19:24,699 --> 00:19:27,902
I'm guessing that's the
doll you were talking about?

287
00:19:27,935 --> 00:19:29,737
Pretty, isn't it?

288
00:19:29,771 --> 00:19:30,905
Yup.

289
00:19:30,938 --> 00:19:32,439
You should just get rid of it.

290
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:34,575
Well, hold on,
remember we can sell it.

291
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:36,544
No, actually, I agree
with Izzy on this one,

292
00:19:36,577 --> 00:19:38,412
I think we should just
probably get rid of it.

293
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:39,312
Why?

294
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:40,715
Scares you?

295
00:19:40,748 --> 00:19:42,684
Okay, how does that not
make you shit our pants?

296
00:19:42,717 --> 00:19:45,452
Because it's a toy, it's
not going to do anything.

297
00:19:46,688 --> 00:19:50,290
Well, that's two
for stay, two for go.

298
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:54,261
So Ben, you're the
tiebreaker, what do you say?

299
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:57,832
Let's get rid of it.

300
00:19:57,865 --> 00:19:59,499
All right, fair's fair.

301
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,936
Rick, take it outside.

302
00:20:03,738 --> 00:20:05,372
Why do I have to do it?

303
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:07,975
Because you're the
one that dropped it

304
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:09,744
and voted it out, dumb ass.

305
00:20:09,777 --> 00:20:11,946
They voted the same, so.

306
00:20:14,015 --> 00:20:15,215
You're closer.

307
00:20:17,685 --> 00:20:20,988
Fine, fine, I'll do it, fine.

308
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,600
You suck.

309
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:03,798
The hell is that?

310
00:21:05,066 --> 00:21:06,466
It's a doll they found.

311
00:21:10,004 --> 00:21:11,004
God, that's creepy.

312
00:21:12,006 --> 00:21:13,841
Hey man, do you wanna come up

313
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:15,877
and help sort
stuff in the attic?

314
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:19,478
Ozzy?

315
00:21:29,824 --> 00:21:30,824
Oscar?

316
00:21:49,577 --> 00:21:50,577
Ozzy?

317
00:21:58,052 --> 00:21:59,419
What the hell was that?

318
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:09,573
Oh my god,
what the hell did you do?

319
00:22:09,597 --> 00:22:10,597
I don't know.

320
00:22:14,068 --> 00:22:15,837
Hey, look at me, look at me.

321
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,104
Look at me.

322
00:22:17,138 --> 00:22:18,138
Look at me.

323
00:22:19,941 --> 00:22:21,809
Look at me, it's okay.

324
00:22:27,148 --> 00:22:28,448
You're okay.

325
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:29,116
You're okay.

326
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,852
Rick, what happened?

327
00:22:34,121 --> 00:22:37,792
Rick, talk to me, what
happened, what happened?

328
00:22:43,931 --> 00:22:45,365
I saw a lady.

329
00:22:48,736 --> 00:22:52,506
And she grabbed my neck.

330
00:22:58,045 --> 00:22:59,365
Okay, hey, look
at me, look at me.

331
00:22:59,881 --> 00:23:01,015
You're okay, right?

332
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:02,617
You're okay, bud.

333
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,886
Let's get you inside, all
right, let's get you inside.

334
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:06,053
Come on, come on.

335
00:23:06,087 --> 00:23:07,922
Morgan, can you
grab an ice pack?

336
00:23:10,024 --> 00:23:11,158
I got you.

337
00:23:11,192 --> 00:23:12,392
You're okay.

338
00:23:26,207 --> 00:23:27,141
Hey Rick.

339
00:23:27,174 --> 00:23:28,676
You okay?

340
00:23:28,709 --> 00:23:30,211
Just leave him, Morgan.

341
00:23:30,244 --> 00:23:31,411
He's gonna be fine.

342
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:45,359
That was fast.

343
00:23:45,393 --> 00:23:47,995
Yeah, well, the police station's
only a few blocks away.

344
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:49,997
So what happened?

345
00:23:50,031 --> 00:23:51,632
I reported it, I gave
them a description,

346
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:52,833
they said they would start

347
00:23:52,867 --> 00:23:54,467
a search party as
soon as possible.

348
00:23:54,502 --> 00:23:56,904
Do they know who
they're looking for?

349
00:23:56,938 --> 00:23:58,773
Described it the
best I could, Morgan.

350
00:23:58,806 --> 00:23:59,774
Do they know where to start?

351
00:23:59,807 --> 00:24:01,018
Do they know anything right now?

352
00:24:01,042 --> 00:24:03,678
Morgan, they're the police,

353
00:24:03,711 --> 00:24:05,179
they handle this sort of thing.

354
00:24:06,514 --> 00:24:09,050
Look, I know you're
worried, I am too,

355
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:10,123
but they'll figure it out.

356
00:24:13,688 --> 00:24:16,891
All right guys, well, I
start a new job tomorrow,

357
00:24:16,924 --> 00:24:18,092
gotta be there at 6:00 am.

358
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:21,929
So while I'm gone, look
after Rick, will you?

359
00:24:22,863 --> 00:24:23,863
Yeah, okay.

360
00:24:24,632 --> 00:24:26,968
You're starting
that job already?

361
00:24:27,001 --> 00:24:28,669
Someone's gotta pay the bills.

362
00:24:33,874 --> 00:24:36,544
Is there anything
we can do to help?

363
00:24:37,611 --> 00:24:38,879
Like you care.

364
00:24:40,247 --> 00:24:41,949
Look, man, I'm just
trying to be helpful.

365
00:24:41,983 --> 00:24:42,983
Well, you're not.

366
00:24:43,884 --> 00:24:44,986
What's your problem?

367
00:24:45,019 --> 00:24:45,853
What?

368
00:24:45,886 --> 00:24:47,021
What do you mean what?

369
00:24:47,054 --> 00:24:48,589
Why are you being
such an asshole?

370
00:24:48,622 --> 00:24:49,824
Oh, I'm the asshole?

371
00:24:49,857 --> 00:24:51,225
Yes.

372
00:24:51,258 --> 00:24:52,736
I don't get what your deal
is, he didn't nothing wrong.

373
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,130
Exactly, he did nothing.

374
00:24:56,163 --> 00:24:57,163
Okay.

375
00:24:58,165 --> 00:25:00,234
You did nothing.

376
00:25:00,267 --> 00:25:02,003
Just stood there
looking like an idiot

377
00:25:02,036 --> 00:25:03,304
while Rick was losing his shit.

378
00:25:03,337 --> 00:25:04,872
Ozzy.

379
00:25:04,905 --> 00:25:06,874
Now it makes a little
more sense why you're alone.

380
00:25:06,907 --> 00:25:07,907
Oscar.

381
00:25:11,946 --> 00:25:13,848
All right, fine.

382
00:25:17,785 --> 00:25:18,619
Ben, i-

383
00:25:18,652 --> 00:25:20,054
- it's okay.

384
00:25:20,087 --> 00:25:21,087
Sorry.

385
00:25:58,225 --> 00:25:59,560
New watch?

386
00:26:00,961 --> 00:26:01,961
No.

387
00:26:03,697 --> 00:26:04,932
It belonged to my father.

388
00:26:06,033 --> 00:26:08,569
It's all I have
left of my parents.

389
00:26:10,971 --> 00:26:12,073
What were they like?

390
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:18,112
They're kind, caring.

391
00:26:23,084 --> 00:26:24,685
They tried their best.

392
00:26:29,123 --> 00:26:31,892
Hey, don't let what
he said get to you.

393
00:26:34,395 --> 00:26:37,865
Just give him time,
he'll warm up to you.

394
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,200
Yeah.

395
00:26:43,003 --> 00:26:44,003
Okay.

396
00:27:14,335 --> 00:27:15,335
Hey man.

397
00:27:17,304 --> 00:27:18,304
Hey.

398
00:27:20,207 --> 00:27:21,742
Can't sleep either?

399
00:27:22,977 --> 00:27:23,977
Guess not.

400
00:27:25,813 --> 00:27:26,914
Me neither.

401
00:27:31,752 --> 00:27:33,420
I know everyone
thinks I'm crazy,

402
00:27:33,454 --> 00:27:37,057
but I understand, I
don't know what happened.

403
00:27:37,091 --> 00:27:39,260
Hey, hey, I'm sure
no one thinks that.

404
00:27:43,797 --> 00:27:44,932
Where you going?

405
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:48,969
Just about to go on a walk.

406
00:27:49,003 --> 00:27:51,839
At 2:00 am with a backpack?

407
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,840
Snacks?

408
00:28:01,815 --> 00:28:02,815
You're leaving.

409
00:28:03,884 --> 00:28:06,020
I don't belong here, Rick,

410
00:28:06,053 --> 00:28:08,222
this whole family
thing, it isn't for me.

411
00:28:08,255 --> 00:28:09,190
Why?

412
00:28:09,223 --> 00:28:10,324
It's barely been two days.

413
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:11,792
Exactly, it's
barely been two days

414
00:28:11,825 --> 00:28:13,069
and one of you already hates me.

415
00:28:13,093 --> 00:28:15,496
That one up there
is acting all weird.

416
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:16,931
And you, you're-

417
00:28:16,964 --> 00:28:17,964
- what?

418
00:28:19,233 --> 00:28:21,435
I barely know any of you.

419
00:28:21,468 --> 00:28:25,973
We quite literally just met,
why do you care that I leaving?

420
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:28,876
I mean, 'cause you're one of us.

421
00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:30,377
No, I'm not.

422
00:28:34,114 --> 00:28:37,918
Look, look, no
one's gonna miss me.

423
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,222
You'll forget I even existed,

424
00:28:41,255 --> 00:28:43,791
you'll have one less
person to worry about.

425
00:28:43,824 --> 00:28:44,824
And then what?

426
00:28:47,261 --> 00:28:48,872
You're going to spend the
rest of your life alone

427
00:28:48,896 --> 00:28:51,465
missing the chance to
be a part of a family?

428
00:28:51,498 --> 00:28:55,836
Which a lot of foster kids
our age don't get, by the way.

429
00:28:55,869 --> 00:28:57,972
And just not care
about anybody else?

430
00:28:58,005 --> 00:28:59,340
That doesn't sound too bad.

431
00:29:02,476 --> 00:29:07,481
Okay.

432
00:29:08,382 --> 00:29:09,883
Okay, okay, how about this?

433
00:29:11,553 --> 00:29:15,122
Just stay one more day
to see how it goes.

434
00:29:15,155 --> 00:29:15,990
Dude, come on, man, come on.

435
00:29:16,023 --> 00:29:16,957
If you don't know,

436
00:29:16,991 --> 00:29:20,528
just stay one more day
and see how it goes,

437
00:29:20,562 --> 00:29:23,030
you don't like it, you leave.

438
00:29:28,102 --> 00:29:29,236
Fine.

439
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:32,540
Fine, one more
day, one more day.

440
00:29:32,574 --> 00:29:34,275
One more day.

441
00:29:34,308 --> 00:29:36,477
One more day, one more day.

442
00:29:36,511 --> 00:29:39,581
You do know I'm gonna
prove you wrong.

443
00:29:39,614 --> 00:29:40,814
Don't push it, don't push it.

444
00:29:40,848 --> 00:29:41,882
Sorry.

445
00:29:41,915 --> 00:29:42,915
Sorry.

446
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:57,965
Hey, hey man.

447
00:29:57,998 --> 00:29:58,998
Hey.

448
00:30:01,902 --> 00:30:03,437
Gonna do that every time?

449
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:06,473
Oh, sorry, just me being polite.

450
00:30:06,508 --> 00:30:07,374
Yeah.

451
00:30:07,408 --> 00:30:09,176
Hey, you feeling better?

452
00:30:09,209 --> 00:30:11,178
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

453
00:30:11,211 --> 00:30:12,211
Good, good.

454
00:30:14,214 --> 00:30:17,017
Hey, I was actually
thinking we play this game,

455
00:30:17,051 --> 00:30:20,454
it's kind of like a
team-building exercise thing.

456
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:24,458
Okay, so basically one
person has the bomb

457
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:27,328
and the other person
has the instructions

458
00:30:27,361 --> 00:30:29,463
on how to be disabled the bomb.

459
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:31,065
It's super fun.

460
00:30:31,098 --> 00:30:32,342
I think I'm gonna take
a walk, Rick, wanna join?

461
00:30:32,366 --> 00:30:34,502
Actually, is it okay
if I sit this one out?

462
00:30:34,536 --> 00:30:36,103
Okay.

463
00:30:36,136 --> 00:30:37,371
Maybe Ben can join you?

464
00:30:37,404 --> 00:30:38,472
Oh no.

465
00:30:38,506 --> 00:30:40,608
Actually, sure.

466
00:30:40,642 --> 00:30:42,343
I just got-

467
00:30:42,376 --> 00:30:45,179
- well, I actually
insist, so come on.

468
00:31:04,699 --> 00:31:09,169
So, do you think he
actually imagined it?

469
00:31:09,203 --> 00:31:11,038
Look, I'm only gonna
ask you this once.

470
00:31:11,071 --> 00:31:11,972
Got it?

471
00:31:12,005 --> 00:31:13,107
Are you messing with him?

472
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,041
What?

473
00:31:14,074 --> 00:31:15,209
Are you messing with him?

474
00:31:15,242 --> 00:31:16,587
Is this some stupid
joke you pulled?

475
00:31:16,611 --> 00:31:17,987
'Cause if it is, you need
to tell me right now.

476
00:31:18,011 --> 00:31:20,214
Okay, what are
you talking about?

477
00:31:20,247 --> 00:31:21,525
Piece of paper, that wasn't you?

478
00:31:21,549 --> 00:31:22,483
What piece of paper?

479
00:31:22,517 --> 00:31:23,417
What joke?

480
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:25,419
What are you talking about?

481
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:31,158
Rick found that on the floor
in his room this morning.

482
00:31:34,562 --> 00:31:37,398
Ben, I need you to promise me

483
00:31:37,431 --> 00:31:40,502
that you didn't do this
because this isn't funny.

484
00:31:40,535 --> 00:31:42,302
I promise you this wasn't me.

485
00:31:44,606 --> 00:31:45,540
Why would I leave
this piece of paper

486
00:31:45,573 --> 00:31:47,107
with this word on it anyways?

487
00:31:52,346 --> 00:31:55,149
Besides, he didn't seem
too freaked out just now.

488
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:58,061
He thinks someone's
playing a sick joke on him,

489
00:31:58,085 --> 00:32:00,220
so he's not taking it seriously.

490
00:32:00,254 --> 00:32:01,388
Besides, I'm usually the one

491
00:32:01,422 --> 00:32:03,190
who does most of
the worrying anyway.

492
00:32:04,324 --> 00:32:06,460
Well, what if it is just a joke?

493
00:32:06,493 --> 00:32:07,461
Can't be.

494
00:32:07,494 --> 00:32:08,494
Why not?

495
00:32:12,366 --> 00:32:14,034
When Rick was little,

496
00:32:14,067 --> 00:32:16,136
his real mom and dad
took him to the mall.

497
00:32:17,271 --> 00:32:19,273
They took him to
the big toy store,

498
00:32:19,306 --> 00:32:20,441
got him what he wanted,

499
00:32:21,609 --> 00:32:24,311
when he wasn't looking,
they walked away.

500
00:32:24,344 --> 00:32:25,345
They left him there.

501
00:32:26,313 --> 00:32:27,549
Why?

502
00:32:27,582 --> 00:32:29,183
He doesn't know.

503
00:32:29,216 --> 00:32:34,221
He just remembers feeling
lost, scared, abandoned.

504
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,695
Well, that still doesn't explain

505
00:32:40,728 --> 00:32:43,330
why can't just be a sick joke.

506
00:32:43,363 --> 00:32:46,233
'Cause I'm the only person
who's ever told that story to.

507
00:32:48,168 --> 00:32:52,072
I know you couldn't have
done this, I'm just worried.

508
00:32:52,105 --> 00:32:56,143
Stupid as he is sometimes,
he's always been there.

509
00:32:56,176 --> 00:32:58,345
I don't want him to
feel like that again.

510
00:33:01,315 --> 00:33:03,116
Seems like he trusts you a lot.

511
00:33:05,653 --> 00:33:07,689
So why you telling me?

512
00:33:11,191 --> 00:33:12,459
'Cause he trusts you too.

513
00:33:14,061 --> 00:33:15,429
To be honest, I'm not sure why,

514
00:33:15,462 --> 00:33:16,764
you've only been here two days.

515
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:17,798
Yeah.

516
00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:21,669
So what do you
think is going on?

517
00:33:21,703 --> 00:33:25,205
I mean, first is he starts
acting all weird for no reason.

518
00:33:25,239 --> 00:33:29,777
And now Rick thinks
he saw a woman,

519
00:33:29,811 --> 00:33:31,679
maybe he is actually
losing his mind.

520
00:33:32,647 --> 00:33:33,648
I don't think he is.

521
00:33:33,681 --> 00:33:34,681
What do you mean?

522
00:33:35,683 --> 00:33:38,452
The first night I got here,

523
00:33:38,485 --> 00:33:41,421
I saw someone walk around
the house with the doll.

524
00:33:41,455 --> 00:33:42,455
What?

525
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:45,593
Izzy and I saw someone in
the window that night too.

526
00:33:45,627 --> 00:33:48,830
And it looked like a woman.

527
00:33:48,863 --> 00:33:50,130
Ben, are you serious?

528
00:33:50,163 --> 00:33:51,699
It sounds insane, I know.

529
00:33:51,733 --> 00:33:54,101
Why didn't you
say anything sooner?

530
00:33:54,134 --> 00:33:55,469
Would you really
have believed me

531
00:33:55,503 --> 00:33:57,639
if I told you there
was a mysterious lady

532
00:33:57,672 --> 00:34:00,274
walking around the
house with the doll?

533
00:34:00,307 --> 00:34:01,275
Okay, fair enough.

534
00:34:01,308 --> 00:34:02,308
Exactly.

535
00:34:03,711 --> 00:34:05,379
So what are you saying?

536
00:34:05,412 --> 00:34:08,448
Are you saying that there's
a person in our house

537
00:34:08,482 --> 00:34:10,618
or are you saying that
our house is haunted?

538
00:34:10,652 --> 00:34:12,554
All I'm saying is it's
pretty weird for Rick

539
00:34:12,587 --> 00:34:14,756
and I to have possibly
seen the same person.

540
00:34:17,424 --> 00:34:18,458
So what do we do?

541
00:34:20,294 --> 00:34:21,829
Well, there is still one place

542
00:34:21,863 --> 00:34:24,298
we might be able
to find something.

543
00:34:24,331 --> 00:34:26,701
What exactly
are we looking for again?

544
00:34:26,734 --> 00:34:30,203
Anything that looks
older, creepy pretty much

545
00:34:30,237 --> 00:34:31,839
or anything that looks
like what you saw.

546
00:34:31,873 --> 00:34:34,308
Okay, if you think I
actually saw a ghost,

547
00:34:34,341 --> 00:34:35,586
that's the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

548
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,844
Oh, you shouldn't be talking

549
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:39,212
considering you're
afraid of a child's toy.

550
00:34:40,682 --> 00:34:43,083
How long do you plan
on rubbing that in?

551
00:34:45,185 --> 00:34:46,185
Till you die.

552
00:34:47,421 --> 00:34:48,421
Right.

553
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:51,793
Anything?

554
00:34:51,826 --> 00:34:53,795
Just some old photographs.

555
00:34:55,228 --> 00:34:56,831
What do you think they are?

556
00:34:56,864 --> 00:34:59,534
I'm not sure, maybe
they're the people

557
00:34:59,567 --> 00:35:01,234
who lived here before us?

558
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:02,670
Some have dates on
the back of them,

559
00:35:02,704 --> 00:35:05,673
like this one's
from June 7th, 1985.

560
00:35:05,707 --> 00:35:10,377
And this one's from
December 26th, 1973.

561
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:13,413
Why would they
leave all this behind?

562
00:35:13,447 --> 00:35:14,782
That's what I'm wondering.

563
00:35:23,691 --> 00:35:27,427
Ben, do you think we
really saw something?

564
00:35:28,462 --> 00:35:30,598
What if we did just imagine it?

565
00:35:31,733 --> 00:35:34,234
I thought we did too,
it doesn't make sense

566
00:35:34,267 --> 00:35:35,803
for us all imagine
the same thing.

567
00:35:36,938 --> 00:35:39,406
Whoa, guys, look at this.

568
00:35:52,887 --> 00:35:54,287
What the hell?

569
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:58,626
Guess someone
really likes dolls.

570
00:36:01,929 --> 00:36:03,798
And what's all this?

571
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:12,740
Just some more old papers.

572
00:36:12,774 --> 00:36:14,474
What does it say?

573
00:36:14,509 --> 00:36:15,643
They're journal entries.

574
00:36:15,677 --> 00:36:17,879
Maybe they're from
whoever lived here last.

575
00:36:19,714 --> 00:36:20,714
No.

576
00:36:22,249 --> 00:36:26,754
Guys, whoever wrote this,
the date they put was 1692.

577
00:36:30,658 --> 00:36:35,663
May 5th, 1692,
fire rages within me.

578
00:36:36,798 --> 00:36:38,498
They say what I've
done is a curse.

579
00:36:38,533 --> 00:36:43,203
They mock me for it,
call me inhuman, a demon.

580
00:36:44,337 --> 00:36:45,983
They will not understand
that what I've done

581
00:36:46,007 --> 00:36:48,976
is not a curse, but
rather a gift of life.

582
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:51,311
They believe they can
burn all of my work,

583
00:36:51,344 --> 00:36:54,481
destroy what I've created,
but I won't let them,

584
00:36:55,817 --> 00:36:58,485
if they come from me, I will
set the fires of hell on them.

585
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:01,622
Whoa.

586
00:37:01,656 --> 00:37:02,724
What?

587
00:37:02,757 --> 00:37:04,324
They spelled inhuman wrong.

588
00:37:06,994 --> 00:37:07,962
Are you serious?

589
00:37:07,995 --> 00:37:08,930
Yeah.

590
00:37:08,963 --> 00:37:09,963
Yeah, look.

591
00:37:15,302 --> 00:37:17,337
Oh yeah, they really did.

592
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:19,674
These all have a lot
of spelling mistakes.

593
00:37:19,707 --> 00:37:23,310
People in the 1600s weren't
exactly the most intelligent,

594
00:37:23,343 --> 00:37:25,046
I guess it makes sense.

595
00:37:39,761 --> 00:37:41,361
What are you guys doing?

596
00:37:41,394 --> 00:37:42,697
I mean, that was-

597
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:43,765
- terrible.

598
00:37:43,798 --> 00:37:44,766
Amazing.

599
00:37:44,799 --> 00:37:46,399
I mean, bravo.

600
00:37:46,433 --> 00:37:47,902
Okay, yeah.

601
00:37:48,803 --> 00:37:50,071
Whatever, all right.

602
00:37:50,104 --> 00:37:51,639
What is all this?

603
00:37:51,672 --> 00:37:54,341
This is stuff that's
been sitting in a suitcase

604
00:37:54,374 --> 00:37:56,309
in the attic for
about 300 years.

605
00:37:56,343 --> 00:37:59,446
And still smells better
than you right now, so-

606
00:38:00,081 --> 00:38:01,081
- shut up.

607
00:38:02,717 --> 00:38:05,920
Oh, oh, seriously though,
take a shower or something.

608
00:38:05,953 --> 00:38:07,088
Whoa, whose are these?

609
00:38:07,121 --> 00:38:08,990
Oh, those were also in the case.

610
00:38:09,023 --> 00:38:11,025
So what, now there's four dolls?

611
00:38:11,058 --> 00:38:13,326
Well, three, I put the
other one in the trash.

612
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,738
Why are you guys going
through the stuff anyways,

613
00:38:14,762 --> 00:38:17,397
I thought Sam said
to wait for him.

614
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:21,903
Well, we think that
maybe whatever Rick saw

615
00:38:21,936 --> 00:38:24,005
might have something
to do with this stuff.

616
00:38:24,038 --> 00:38:27,307
So what, you guys think
our place is haunted now?

617
00:38:27,975 --> 00:38:29,043
Ben.

618
00:38:29,076 --> 00:38:29,911
What's wrong?

619
00:38:29,944 --> 00:38:30,944
Look.

620
00:38:33,014 --> 00:38:34,347
What's it say?

621
00:38:36,818 --> 00:38:41,823
December 1st, 1692,
there was a great sickness

622
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:45,660
in the world, one
so cruel and evil,

623
00:38:45,693 --> 00:38:47,128
it is willing to
leave its innocent

624
00:38:47,161 --> 00:38:49,964
children to suffer
and feel hopeless.

625
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:52,767
A child, which I found today

626
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,435
believed he would
never feel loved

627
00:38:55,468 --> 00:38:57,705
for his mother
had abandoned him.

628
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,877
He thought no one could
save him but I did,

629
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:04,879
this child along with my own

630
00:39:04,912 --> 00:39:07,882
will never have
to endure the pain

631
00:39:07,915 --> 00:39:11,686
and the evil of this world,
they shall always be with me.

632
00:39:12,987 --> 00:39:15,556
Everyone on the
outside calls me sick,

633
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:19,492
evil, a witch, but
they know nothing.

634
00:39:20,561 --> 00:39:21,561
They never will.

635
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:25,600
They can hang me,
burn me, torture me,

636
00:39:25,633 --> 00:39:27,602
I will always care
for my children,

637
00:39:28,936 --> 00:39:32,106
for I will always have them
tied to the end of my strings.

638
00:39:35,576 --> 00:39:36,476
What the hell was that?

639
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,510
That came from my room.

640
00:39:40,447 --> 00:39:42,750
Okay, this is one
of you guys, right?

641
00:39:42,783 --> 00:39:44,018
Someone doing a prank?

642
00:39:44,051 --> 00:39:44,986
What?

643
00:39:45,019 --> 00:39:46,687
I'm not stupid, this
is one of you guys.

644
00:39:46,721 --> 00:39:47,755
No it wasn't.

645
00:39:50,224 --> 00:39:51,826
This is bullshit.

646
00:39:51,859 --> 00:39:52,760
No, no Oscar.

647
00:39:52,793 --> 00:39:53,904
Ozzy wait, don't go up there.

648
00:39:53,928 --> 00:39:55,162
Don't go up there.

649
00:39:55,196 --> 00:39:56,196
Ozzy.

650
00:39:59,901 --> 00:40:01,769
Yeah, pretty funny guys.

651
00:40:01,802 --> 00:40:03,638
Which one do you sit
the doll in there?

652
00:40:14,481 --> 00:40:15,616
So who was it?

653
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:19,620
That wasn't any of us.

654
00:40:21,522 --> 00:40:22,657
Really?

655
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:23,891
'Cause my money's on you.

656
00:40:25,026 --> 00:40:25,860
You know what?

657
00:40:25,893 --> 00:40:26,928
Screw this.

658
00:40:26,961 --> 00:40:28,129
- No, no, Morgan.
- Stop.

659
00:40:28,162 --> 00:40:30,932
None of this is real, this
is all just some stupid joke.

660
00:40:30,965 --> 00:40:31,966
No, Morgan.

661
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,936
Look, see?

662
00:40:34,969 --> 00:40:36,436
Just a stupid toy.

663
00:40:38,973 --> 00:40:39,973
Morgan.

664
00:40:41,842 --> 00:40:44,011
Hey, open the door.

665
00:40:44,045 --> 00:40:45,212
I'm trying.

666
00:40:45,246 --> 00:40:46,246
Morgan.

667
00:40:51,185 --> 00:40:53,020
Open the door, Morgan.

668
00:41:05,866 --> 00:41:06,866
Guys.

669
00:41:10,871 --> 00:41:11,772
Hey, hey, hey, Morgan.

670
00:41:11,806 --> 00:41:12,640
Hey, move.

671
00:41:12,673 --> 00:41:13,975
Move.

672
00:41:14,008 --> 00:41:16,510
No, no, no, Morgan,
Morgan, open the door.

673
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,544
Morgan.

674
00:41:20,748 --> 00:41:21,748
Morgan.

675
00:41:25,753 --> 00:41:26,988
It's me, it's me.

676
00:41:33,761 --> 00:41:34,761
It's okay.

677
00:41:38,899 --> 00:41:41,202
So you're saying
there's an evil doll

678
00:41:41,235 --> 00:41:45,039
and a woman in a red dress
walking around our house.

679
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,242
Haunting us right now?

680
00:41:51,278 --> 00:41:54,015
When you say it like that,
it makes us sound stupid.

681
00:41:56,183 --> 00:41:59,687
Okay, look guys, I
know since Evelyn died,

682
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,824
it hasn't been easy and we've
been moving place to place,

683
00:42:03,858 --> 00:42:05,035
I've had to leave
at least five years-

684
00:42:05,059 --> 00:42:08,029
- no, Sam, we're not
imagining things.

685
00:42:08,062 --> 00:42:10,297
Ben and I saw a
woman in the window.

686
00:42:10,331 --> 00:42:11,932
Rick said he saw another woman.

687
00:42:11,966 --> 00:42:14,301
And now Morgan saying
she saw the same one.

688
00:42:14,335 --> 00:42:17,038
And on top of that, we found
a case full of creepy stuff,

689
00:42:17,071 --> 00:42:18,806
I mean, we're not
making this up.

690
00:42:21,709 --> 00:42:23,778
Ben, is it true?

691
00:42:23,811 --> 00:42:25,579
Why are you asking him?

692
00:42:25,613 --> 00:42:27,181
What's wrong with me asking him?

693
00:42:28,215 --> 00:42:29,817
Why do you hate me so much?

694
00:42:31,118 --> 00:42:32,253
Ever since I got here,

695
00:42:32,286 --> 00:42:34,889
you've done nothing
but talk shit about me.

696
00:42:34,922 --> 00:42:38,225
If I've done something
wrong, I'm sorry.

697
00:42:40,661 --> 00:42:42,063
Now is there any
way we can help-

698
00:42:42,096 --> 00:42:44,231
- runaway, like you always
do, that would help a lot.

699
00:42:44,265 --> 00:42:46,934
Oscar, what the hell
is wrong with you?

700
00:42:48,169 --> 00:42:50,838
He's family now, you
got a problem with that,

701
00:42:50,871 --> 00:42:53,808
you come talk to
me, I'm always here.

702
00:42:54,975 --> 00:42:57,011
That's the thing,
Sam, you're not.

703
00:42:58,746 --> 00:43:01,082
You're not always here.

704
00:43:01,115 --> 00:43:02,817
You never listen.

705
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:04,618
I told you so many
times after Evelyn died,

706
00:43:04,652 --> 00:43:05,652
don't take him in.

707
00:43:07,121 --> 00:43:08,956
You haven't been able
to keep a steady job,

708
00:43:08,989 --> 00:43:10,367
you've had to move
from place to place,

709
00:43:10,391 --> 00:43:12,359
and now you're just adding
another mouth to feed.

710
00:43:12,393 --> 00:43:13,393
Watch it, Oscar.

711
00:43:28,275 --> 00:43:30,878
He's been acting more
like family than you have.

712
00:43:32,146 --> 00:43:32,980
What?

713
00:43:33,013 --> 00:43:34,013
You heard me.

714
00:43:35,716 --> 00:43:37,852
Okay guys, this
is an important right now.

715
00:43:37,885 --> 00:43:38,819
Oh, so what?

716
00:43:38,853 --> 00:43:39,963
Guy's been here for two days

717
00:43:39,987 --> 00:43:41,131
and what, he's
your boyfriend now?

718
00:43:41,155 --> 00:43:43,324
He's my brother and so are you,

719
00:43:43,357 --> 00:43:45,025
but you haven't even
given him a chance-

720
00:43:45,059 --> 00:43:46,193
- a chance to do what?

721
00:43:47,761 --> 00:43:50,097
Last thing we need in this
house is another runaway.

722
00:43:50,131 --> 00:43:51,031
What?

723
00:43:51,065 --> 00:43:52,299
Oh, she didn't tell you?

724
00:43:53,434 --> 00:43:55,669
She ran away from her
home just like you.

725
00:43:55,703 --> 00:43:56,437
I was a kid when that happened.

726
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:57,938
Well, you haven't changed.

727
00:43:57,972 --> 00:43:58,906
Guys, come on.

728
00:43:58,939 --> 00:44:00,141
You're still that little kid

729
00:44:00,174 --> 00:44:01,942
who's too stupid to
think for themselves.

730
00:44:01,976 --> 00:44:02,877
Watch it.

731
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:03,910
Or what?

732
00:44:05,746 --> 00:44:09,049
Maybe you really are the
reason your mom killed herself.

733
00:44:29,504 --> 00:44:30,504
Izzy.

734
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:34,675
Izzy, it's me.

735
00:44:36,944 --> 00:44:38,445
I don't know if you can hear me

736
00:44:39,813 --> 00:44:43,050
or if you're ignoring
me, which is fine too.

737
00:44:44,084 --> 00:44:48,923
But I'm sorry.

738
00:44:58,299 --> 00:45:00,334
I was seven when it happened.

739
00:45:02,836 --> 00:45:06,040
I was playing outside
with my friends,

740
00:45:08,042 --> 00:45:12,379
we had this game where we
would jump over a skateboard

741
00:45:12,413 --> 00:45:14,215
we found with our scooters.

742
00:45:16,551 --> 00:45:18,252
I used to record
everything then.

743
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:50,384
We thought it was so funny
when we would just fall.

744
00:46:14,441 --> 00:46:17,311
That was the last
time I saw them.

745
00:46:22,416 --> 00:46:27,421
After that I went
inside to show my mom.

746
00:46:32,226 --> 00:46:37,231
When I found her,
she was injecting herself with something.

747
00:46:43,337 --> 00:46:48,342
She was lying on the floor
reaching her hand out to me.

748
00:46:55,049 --> 00:46:57,117
She asked me to help her.

749
00:46:59,353 --> 00:47:03,257
I just got so scared
because of how she looked.

750
00:47:06,927 --> 00:47:07,995
And I ran.

751
00:47:10,665 --> 00:47:12,966
And I kept thinking to myself,

752
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,571
what have you stayed
and not so scared

753
00:47:16,604 --> 00:47:20,974
and had you weren't so stupid,
you could've saved her.

754
00:47:28,115 --> 00:47:29,350
I never knew my parents.

755
00:47:31,686 --> 00:47:35,255
I know I told you earlier
that they were kind and caring,

756
00:47:35,289 --> 00:47:39,360
but that's just
how I imagine them,

757
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:44,398
and all they left
me was this watch.

758
00:47:46,934 --> 00:47:49,937
And I waited and I
watched time pass

759
00:47:51,606 --> 00:47:55,142
by on this stupid watch

760
00:47:55,175 --> 00:47:58,445
and all I did was wait
for them to come back.

761
00:48:01,281 --> 00:48:04,284
When I was adopted for the
first time, I hated it,

762
00:48:08,556 --> 00:48:11,191
I was so used to being on my own

763
00:48:12,292 --> 00:48:14,294
and I hated when it changed.

764
00:48:14,328 --> 00:48:18,165
So I ran.

765
00:48:21,536 --> 00:48:23,437
Did the same thing
with the next one.

766
00:48:27,474 --> 00:48:29,276
How come you
haven't left us yet?

767
00:48:30,978 --> 00:48:32,580
To be honest, I don't know.

768
00:48:38,018 --> 00:48:40,020
I know I'm not going to.

769
00:49:03,611 --> 00:49:06,213
Hey guys, there's something.

770
00:49:08,382 --> 00:49:10,150
Am I interrupting anything?

771
00:49:10,184 --> 00:49:11,318
No.

772
00:49:11,351 --> 00:49:12,486
Are you sure-

773
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,121
- no, you're okay.
- You're fine.

774
00:49:14,154 --> 00:49:15,422
Okay, cool.

775
00:49:15,456 --> 00:49:19,326
Because there is actually
something I got to show you guys.

776
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,061
Both of you.

777
00:49:21,094 --> 00:49:22,094
Come on.

778
00:49:32,574 --> 00:49:35,442
Okay, I was reading the
entries you made around earlier

779
00:49:35,476 --> 00:49:37,712
and I noticed something.

780
00:49:37,745 --> 00:49:42,049
In each one of these, it was
dated in either 1692 or 1693.

781
00:49:43,651 --> 00:49:45,753
And then on this one, she said,

782
00:49:45,787 --> 00:49:50,123
"they call me sick,
evil, a witch."

783
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:56,063
Guys what happened
in 1692 and 1693,

784
00:49:57,799 --> 00:50:00,400
the Salem witch trials.

785
00:50:00,434 --> 00:50:01,434
Are you sure?

786
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:04,506
Yeah, I looked it up.

787
00:50:08,108 --> 00:50:11,311
So what are you saying
that this person is a witch?

788
00:50:11,345 --> 00:50:12,479
Maybe.

789
00:50:12,514 --> 00:50:16,049
But I think it's the
woman we've been seeing.

790
00:50:16,083 --> 00:50:17,117
How is that possible?

791
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:18,520
This was hundreds of years ago.

792
00:50:18,553 --> 00:50:21,088
Each person in this
room has seen her.

793
00:50:21,121 --> 00:50:24,191
Okay, earlier today we saw a
door opening close on its own.

794
00:50:24,224 --> 00:50:26,260
I don't think the
idea of a witch

795
00:50:26,293 --> 00:50:28,195
sounds impossible right now.

796
00:50:28,228 --> 00:50:29,664
Well, is there anything else?

797
00:50:31,164 --> 00:50:35,670
After that she wrote, "I will
always care for my children",

798
00:50:35,703 --> 00:50:39,774
"five of them tied to
the end of my strings."

799
00:50:41,441 --> 00:50:43,043
What do you think that means?

800
00:50:47,649 --> 00:50:52,620
Hold on, you're
saying that's a person?

801
00:50:54,589 --> 00:50:55,723
Wild guess.

802
00:50:55,757 --> 00:50:57,592
How would you even
do something like that?

803
00:50:57,625 --> 00:51:01,161
Okay, I'm not sure, but
I have this feeling that.

804
00:51:01,194 --> 00:51:02,194
Hey.

805
00:51:05,165 --> 00:51:06,166
Hey.

806
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:13,440
Is she dead yet.

807
00:51:13,473 --> 00:51:16,578
Hello, who are you?

808
00:51:18,546 --> 00:51:19,546
Where am I?

809
00:51:22,517 --> 00:51:23,517
Hey.

810
00:51:25,853 --> 00:51:26,854
Hey, it's okay.

811
00:51:28,756 --> 00:51:29,857
We're not gonna hurt you.

812
00:51:32,727 --> 00:51:34,729
Where did you come from?

813
00:51:39,433 --> 00:51:41,335
So I'm just gonna
ask one more time

814
00:51:41,368 --> 00:51:43,370
to make sure before I go,

815
00:51:43,403 --> 00:51:45,640
do you have any idea where
he could have come from?

816
00:51:45,673 --> 00:51:48,676
No, not exactly sure
how he got in the house

817
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:49,710
in the first place.

818
00:51:50,912 --> 00:51:53,615
Well, I spoke with
a kid and he said,

819
00:51:53,648 --> 00:51:55,683
apparently he's been
here the whole time.

820
00:51:57,284 --> 00:51:59,262
Sure you don't have anybody
else you're hiding in here?

821
00:51:59,286 --> 00:52:02,456
No, we weren't hiding
anyone in the first place.

822
00:52:08,261 --> 00:52:10,898
Look, officer, if you
don't mind me asking,

823
00:52:10,932 --> 00:52:12,432
did he tell you his name?

824
00:52:12,466 --> 00:52:13,466
Yeah.

825
00:52:14,636 --> 00:52:15,636
John marsh.

826
00:52:16,971 --> 00:52:18,171
Ring any bells?

827
00:52:19,272 --> 00:52:20,272
No.

828
00:52:21,576 --> 00:52:23,811
Well, I'm gonna have to
take him into the station,

829
00:52:25,278 --> 00:52:27,582
gonna see if anybody's
looking for him.

830
00:52:27,615 --> 00:52:29,449
Thank you, officer.

831
00:52:29,483 --> 00:52:32,620
Oh, and don't leave
town until we fix this.

832
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:57,444
What are you looking at?

833
00:52:57,477 --> 00:52:59,547
I googled his name.

834
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:00,580
Find anything?

835
00:53:02,016 --> 00:53:03,016
Yeah.

836
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:08,388
Anyone wanna explain to me
how a random kid got in here?

837
00:53:08,422 --> 00:53:10,290
I'm thinking of something
to do with the doll.

838
00:53:10,323 --> 00:53:11,323
Stop it, Rick.

839
00:53:12,026 --> 00:53:13,326
What?

840
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:16,631
Just stop with
this whole doll thing

841
00:53:16,664 --> 00:53:18,633
and tell me what the hell
is it going on with you?

842
00:53:18,666 --> 00:53:20,333
No, we told you, we found-

843
00:53:20,367 --> 00:53:22,436
- I'm not talking
about all that.

844
00:53:22,469 --> 00:53:23,938
What's wrong with you guys?

845
00:53:23,971 --> 00:53:25,840
And who hell was that kid?

846
00:53:25,873 --> 00:53:26,873
Sam.

847
00:53:33,346 --> 00:53:36,383
Look, I'm trying here.

848
00:53:44,759 --> 00:53:45,893
Just pick this crap up.

849
00:53:52,432 --> 00:53:55,268
Is there anything we can do?

850
00:53:55,302 --> 00:53:59,507
Leave him, let him
breathe for a while.

851
00:54:01,609 --> 00:54:05,412
Let's just call it a night and
figure the rest out tomorrow.

852
00:54:06,748 --> 00:54:09,382
I don't think any of us are
getting any sleep tonight.

853
00:54:10,651 --> 00:54:12,820
Better than sitting
here and doing nothing.

854
00:54:14,055 --> 00:54:18,025
What if something happens?

855
00:54:18,059 --> 00:54:20,962
What if we all slept
out here tonight?

856
00:54:20,995 --> 00:54:22,597
That way we're still together.

857
00:54:25,066 --> 00:54:26,366
Where are you going?

858
00:54:28,069 --> 00:54:29,436
To sleep in my own bed.

859
00:54:58,966 --> 00:54:59,966
Morgan.

860
00:55:01,035 --> 00:55:02,035
Morgan.

861
00:55:03,104 --> 00:55:04,672
Guys.

862
00:55:17,417 --> 00:55:18,853
This is a bad idea.

863
00:56:57,551 --> 00:56:58,552
Afternoon.

864
00:56:59,553 --> 00:57:00,821
What time is it?

865
00:57:00,855 --> 00:57:01,855
1:00.

866
00:57:04,558 --> 00:57:07,628
Was getting a bit worried,
started to think you died.

867
00:57:07,662 --> 00:57:08,963
You got worried about me?

868
00:57:10,031 --> 00:57:11,699
Didn't wanna carry out the body.

869
00:57:13,601 --> 00:57:14,602
Hey, where's Rick?

870
00:57:16,504 --> 00:57:17,905
I don't know.

871
00:57:17,939 --> 00:57:20,508
Well, did you see him?

872
00:57:20,541 --> 00:57:21,676
Where's Sam?

873
00:57:21,709 --> 00:57:23,110
No, I haven't seen him.

874
00:57:23,144 --> 00:57:25,212
And Sam left for work hours ago.

875
00:57:25,246 --> 00:57:27,114
Well, did Rick go with him?

876
00:57:27,148 --> 00:57:28,983
I have no idea.

877
00:57:29,016 --> 00:57:30,560
So you don't know
if Rick left with Sam?

878
00:57:30,584 --> 00:57:32,620
I already told you,
I haven't seen him.

879
00:57:35,723 --> 00:57:38,159
Guys, guys,
guys, wake up, wake up.

880
00:57:38,192 --> 00:57:39,492
Rick's not here.

881
00:57:39,527 --> 00:57:40,161
What?

882
00:57:40,194 --> 00:57:41,629
Rick, he's gone.

883
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:45,800
Oscar, can you please
help me look for him?

884
00:57:45,833 --> 00:57:47,244
I already told you
I haven't seen him.

885
00:57:47,268 --> 00:57:49,770
Have you really forgotten
everything that's been going on?

886
00:57:49,804 --> 00:57:50,705
No I haven't, but-

887
00:57:50,738 --> 00:57:52,173
- then what's the problem?

888
00:57:52,206 --> 00:57:54,709
Can you just predict you
hate me for 10 minutes

889
00:57:54,742 --> 00:57:55,910
and help me look for him?

890
00:57:57,278 --> 00:57:58,278
Please.

891
00:57:59,146 --> 00:58:00,514
All right, fine.

892
00:58:00,548 --> 00:58:01,692
I really don't know
where he could be,

893
00:58:01,716 --> 00:58:03,584
he's probably just
goofing off somewhere.

894
00:58:03,617 --> 00:58:04,617
Where are the dolls?

895
00:58:19,934 --> 00:58:22,003
We have to find him now.

896
00:58:22,036 --> 00:58:22,870
What do we do?

897
00:58:22,903 --> 00:58:23,903
Call Sam.

898
00:58:39,186 --> 00:58:41,122
It's his phone.

899
00:58:43,224 --> 00:58:44,158
Hey Morgan.

900
00:58:44,191 --> 00:58:45,593
Sam, you need to come home.

901
00:58:45,626 --> 00:58:46,761
I'm already on my way home.

902
00:58:46,794 --> 00:58:48,105
I told you guys I had
a short day today.

903
00:58:48,129 --> 00:58:48,996
Something wrong?

904
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:50,264
Rick's missing.

905
00:58:50,297 --> 00:58:51,766
What do you mean his missing?

906
00:58:51,799 --> 00:58:52,799
He's-

907
00:58:55,336 --> 00:58:56,737
Morgan?

908
00:58:58,372 --> 00:58:59,372
Morgan?

909
00:59:02,743 --> 00:59:03,844
Yeah, I'm here, his-

910
00:59:06,947 --> 00:59:07,947
Morgan?

911
00:59:11,952 --> 00:59:13,721
Morgan, are you okay?

912
00:59:17,258 --> 00:59:18,859
Izzy.

913
00:59:34,642 --> 00:59:35,643
What the hell was that?

914
00:59:35,676 --> 00:59:38,079
It's her, just go, go.

915
00:59:45,152 --> 00:59:46,287
Hey.

916
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:47,855
Hey, hey, you okay?

917
00:59:55,362 --> 01:00:00,367
Okay.

918
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:07,775
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

919
01:00:09,276 --> 01:00:10,111
I'll come back.

920
01:00:10,144 --> 01:00:10,978
Get her out of here.

921
01:00:11,011 --> 01:00:12,011
I can take her, go.

922
01:00:18,786 --> 01:00:19,954
Come on.

923
01:00:19,987 --> 01:00:24,658
Come on, come on, come
on, let's go, let's go.

924
01:00:27,061 --> 01:00:28,129
What happened?

925
01:00:28,162 --> 01:00:29,263
The woman.

926
01:00:29,296 --> 01:00:30,431
Morgan, honey?

927
01:00:30,464 --> 01:00:31,732
Hey.

928
01:00:31,765 --> 01:00:32,943
We gotta get her to a hospital.

929
01:00:32,967 --> 01:00:34,368
No, everyone's still inside.

930
01:00:43,911 --> 01:00:44,911
Son of a bitch.

931
01:00:46,313 --> 01:00:47,681
What do we do?

932
01:00:47,715 --> 01:00:49,283
I don't know.

933
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:11,005
Come on, come on.

934
01:01:11,038 --> 01:01:13,040
Oscar, come on, let's go.

935
01:01:25,486 --> 01:01:26,486
Anything?

936
01:01:27,488 --> 01:01:28,822
His not in the house.

937
01:01:29,823 --> 01:01:31,458
So what's gonna happen?

938
01:01:31,492 --> 01:01:34,395
They're sending
out a search party.

939
01:01:34,428 --> 01:01:35,963
We should go with them.

940
01:01:38,766 --> 01:01:41,368
They won't let us leave
until they find him.

941
01:01:41,402 --> 01:01:44,071
We can't just sit
here and do nothing.

942
01:01:44,104 --> 01:01:45,282
Okay, maybe they
don't let us go,

943
01:01:45,306 --> 01:01:46,307
but why not you?

944
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:48,075
You're the father.

945
01:01:48,108 --> 01:01:49,343
I'm not his real father.

946
01:01:51,979 --> 01:01:54,748
Sam, what did they tell you?

947
01:01:57,184 --> 01:02:01,422
Child services is
getting involved.

948
01:02:06,994 --> 01:02:08,963
They wanna put you guys
back in the foster system.

949
01:02:08,996 --> 01:02:09,997
What does that mean?

950
01:02:11,999 --> 01:02:14,001
It means they'll
take us away from Sam

951
01:02:15,369 --> 01:02:16,870
and we'll all be separated.

952
01:02:18,439 --> 01:02:20,341
If they don't find
him in 24 hours,

953
01:02:21,275 --> 01:02:22,943
that's exactly what will happen.

954
01:02:28,949 --> 01:02:29,949
I'm sorry.

955
01:02:35,557 --> 01:02:36,557
You have to try.

956
01:02:43,163 --> 01:02:46,900
The second night I was
here, I tried to leave.

957
01:02:48,168 --> 01:02:50,404
I didn't wanna have anything
to do with you guys,

958
01:02:50,437 --> 01:02:51,872
so I tried to runaway.

959
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:54,320
That's really heartwarming, Ben.

960
01:02:55,909 --> 01:02:59,079
Rick asked me if I wanted
spend my whole life alone,

961
01:03:00,214 --> 01:03:03,083
no family, no friends,
no one to care for.

962
01:03:04,451 --> 01:03:09,456
And I just keep thinking, what
if I hadn't listened to him?

963
01:03:12,527 --> 01:03:17,097
He didn't quit on me and
I'm not going to quit on him

964
01:03:17,131 --> 01:03:18,932
when he needs us the most.

965
01:03:21,935 --> 01:03:23,003
Come on guys.

966
01:03:26,473 --> 01:03:27,542
His right.

967
01:03:31,345 --> 01:03:32,514
We have to try.

968
01:03:34,181 --> 01:03:36,016
We all know Rick
would do the same.

969
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:37,184
Wait.

970
01:03:37,217 --> 01:03:40,954
Wait, hold on, you
just agreed with me?

971
01:03:42,923 --> 01:03:44,291
Get over it.

972
01:03:44,325 --> 01:03:46,994
Well, what else is
there that we can do?

973
01:03:47,027 --> 01:03:48,329
You know what?

974
01:03:48,362 --> 01:03:49,540
If Rick's not in the house,
where else can he be?

975
01:03:49,564 --> 01:03:50,964
Well, he has to be at the house,

976
01:03:50,998 --> 01:03:52,466
Ben found his phone upstairs.

977
01:03:52,499 --> 01:03:54,602
The cops just said
they looked there.

978
01:03:54,636 --> 01:03:58,205
Besides, even if
we were to go back,

979
01:03:58,238 --> 01:04:01,041
the witch was able to
pick us off one by one,

980
01:04:01,075 --> 01:04:02,343
how do we get past her?

981
01:04:04,178 --> 01:04:05,312
We saw what she can do.

982
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:10,017
She's right, she knew
how to separate us.

983
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:11,885
She attacked us one by one

984
01:04:11,919 --> 01:04:14,556
and she knew what
we would do next.

985
01:04:16,123 --> 01:04:18,192
"Tied to the ends
of my strings."

986
01:04:19,561 --> 01:04:20,394
What?

987
01:04:20,427 --> 01:04:21,663
That's it.

988
01:04:21,696 --> 01:04:22,664
The doll.

989
01:04:22,697 --> 01:04:23,631
What if we broke the doll?

990
01:04:23,665 --> 01:04:25,332
Wait, how would we do that?

991
01:04:25,366 --> 01:04:28,001
I don't know, smash it?

992
01:04:28,035 --> 01:04:29,504
How do we know that would work?

993
01:04:29,537 --> 01:04:32,540
The kid, the one
from last night.

994
01:04:34,074 --> 01:04:36,443
Rick looked up his name,
apparently the kid's family

995
01:04:36,477 --> 01:04:39,913
was extremely wealthy
and the last known member

996
01:04:39,947 --> 01:04:42,650
of the family line
died in the 1700s.

997
01:04:42,684 --> 01:04:45,119
So he was one of
the kids she took.

998
01:04:45,152 --> 01:04:46,286
Maybe.

999
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:48,288
And you breaking
the doll let him out.

1000
01:04:48,322 --> 01:04:50,525
How'd you know that was
going to work, by the way?

1001
01:04:50,558 --> 01:04:52,059
Wild guess.

1002
01:04:52,092 --> 01:04:55,996
Okay, but how do we
get past the burnt kid?

1003
01:04:56,029 --> 01:04:57,231
Burnt kid?

1004
01:04:57,264 --> 01:04:59,433
Yeah, the kid
that was all burned,

1005
01:04:59,466 --> 01:05:00,711
the kid that was
crawling towards me,

1006
01:05:00,735 --> 01:05:03,103
trying to end my life, that kid.

1007
01:05:05,305 --> 01:05:06,541
You guys serious?

1008
01:05:07,675 --> 01:05:09,185
Ben, you were up there with
me, you didn't see that?

1009
01:05:09,209 --> 01:05:10,209
I didn't.

1010
01:05:11,078 --> 01:05:13,113
So what, she's making
us see things now?

1011
01:05:13,147 --> 01:05:15,583
Actually, maybe.

1012
01:05:16,584 --> 01:05:19,019
Morgan, when Rick was attacked,

1013
01:05:19,052 --> 01:05:22,156
you said he felt like he did
when he was at the store?

1014
01:05:22,189 --> 01:05:23,558
Yeah.

1015
01:05:23,591 --> 01:05:24,559
Well, Oscar, was there
ever a moment in your life

1016
01:05:24,592 --> 01:05:28,228
where you saw this burnt kid?

1017
01:05:29,564 --> 01:05:34,569
Well, the whole reason I
was put into the foster system

1018
01:05:35,737 --> 01:05:40,140
was because my family
was killed in a fire.

1019
01:05:44,278 --> 01:05:46,079
I was the only one
who made it out.

1020
01:05:48,583 --> 01:05:50,384
So she's controlling
what we see.

1021
01:05:51,786 --> 01:05:55,289
But that doesn't help us
figure out where Rick is.

1022
01:05:55,322 --> 01:05:56,591
Yes, it does.

1023
01:05:58,091 --> 01:06:00,194
Maybe the police did
look in the right spot,

1024
01:06:00,227 --> 01:06:04,097
but she just made them
see something else.

1025
01:06:04,131 --> 01:06:05,199
We have to go back.

1026
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:09,637
And this time, we know that
whatever we see isn't real.

1027
01:06:10,772 --> 01:06:12,139
We stick together,

1028
01:06:12,172 --> 01:06:13,772
that's the only way
we're gonna find him.

1029
01:06:15,108 --> 01:06:16,108
Come on guys.

1030
01:06:17,244 --> 01:06:18,680
Wait, wait, okay, hold on.

1031
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:22,049
Where am I during all this?

1032
01:06:22,082 --> 01:06:24,552
They're not just going to
let you leave, much less me.

1033
01:06:27,221 --> 01:06:29,189
I think I know of
a way you can help.

1034
01:06:32,694 --> 01:06:34,529
Excuse me, officer.

1035
01:06:35,429 --> 01:06:36,263
How's it going?

1036
01:06:36,296 --> 01:06:37,665
Remember me?

1037
01:06:37,699 --> 01:06:39,299
Of course you do.

1038
01:06:39,333 --> 01:06:44,037
Anyway, so I got a bit of
a stomach issue happening,

1039
01:06:45,172 --> 01:06:46,517
you ever feel like the
insides of your stomach

1040
01:06:46,541 --> 01:06:48,141
are just slowly dying?

1041
01:06:49,711 --> 01:06:52,045
Of course you
don't, look at you,

1042
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:53,581
perfect specimen like yourself?

1043
01:06:53,615 --> 01:06:55,215
Nah.

1044
01:06:55,249 --> 01:06:59,119
But, my stomach is about to
go through the gates of hell

1045
01:06:59,152 --> 01:07:03,390
and I was just hoping you
could help me out with that?

1046
01:07:06,594 --> 01:07:08,428
The bathroom is over there.

1047
01:07:10,497 --> 01:07:14,502
Right, you see,
I don't necessarily

1048
01:07:14,536 --> 01:07:16,103
have to use the bathroom,

1049
01:07:16,136 --> 01:07:20,608
I guess I was just wanting
to get your advice.

1050
01:07:20,642 --> 01:07:23,645
We're not really qualified
to give that type of advice.

1051
01:07:23,678 --> 01:07:24,579
Sure you are.

1052
01:07:24,612 --> 01:07:26,146
Come on.

1053
01:07:26,179 --> 01:07:28,448
Strapping officer like
yourself, what do you bench?

1054
01:07:28,482 --> 01:07:29,482
400?

1055
01:07:30,284 --> 01:07:31,118
Don't touch me.

1056
01:07:31,151 --> 01:07:31,786
Okay, okay.

1057
01:07:31,819 --> 01:07:33,153
All right.

1058
01:07:33,186 --> 01:07:36,724
Well, yeah, I just
figured you two,

1059
01:07:36,758 --> 01:07:39,727
you're out in the
field, professionals,

1060
01:07:39,761 --> 01:07:42,195
maybe you had lunch,
you got the enchiladas,

1061
01:07:42,229 --> 01:07:43,607
you know you shouldn't
have got the enchiladas,

1062
01:07:43,631 --> 01:07:45,399
but you did anyway.

1063
01:07:45,432 --> 01:07:47,434
So you're at this house
and all of a sudden,

1064
01:07:47,467 --> 01:07:48,503
"ooh, what is that?"

1065
01:07:48,536 --> 01:07:50,203
"It's a rumble in my stomach."

1066
01:07:50,237 --> 01:07:53,440
And you ask yourself,
"who do I call?"

1067
01:07:53,473 --> 01:07:54,341
"911?"

1068
01:07:54,374 --> 01:07:55,442
You are 911.

1069
01:07:57,545 --> 01:08:01,415
So I just figured that
maybe you two pros

1070
01:08:01,448 --> 01:08:03,216
just might know a solution.

1071
01:08:09,891 --> 01:08:11,358
We have to go.

1072
01:08:23,403 --> 01:08:24,371
You don't say?

1073
01:08:24,404 --> 01:08:25,404
Yeah.

1074
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:27,174
Hey, hey.

1075
01:08:27,207 --> 01:08:27,842
Let's go, let's go.

1076
01:08:27,875 --> 01:08:28,875
Hey.

1077
01:08:54,334 --> 01:08:59,139
Remember, whatever we
see in there isn't real.

1078
01:09:00,273 --> 01:09:02,810
Stick together and
we'll find him.

1079
01:09:20,494 --> 01:09:22,530
Where do we go?

1080
01:09:22,563 --> 01:09:26,299
Upstairs, that's where
we found his phone.

1081
01:09:29,604 --> 01:09:30,738
Okay.

1082
01:10:19,486 --> 01:10:20,486
Dad?

1083
01:10:26,359 --> 01:10:27,359
Dad.

1084
01:10:38,773 --> 01:10:39,773
Go.

1085
01:10:43,811 --> 01:10:44,811
Get Morgan.

1086
01:10:52,653 --> 01:10:53,653
No.

1087
01:10:54,655 --> 01:10:56,023
- That was my dad.
- No, it's not.

1088
01:10:56,057 --> 01:10:56,891
She's making you see it.

1089
01:10:56,924 --> 01:10:57,759
It's not real.

1090
01:10:57,792 --> 01:10:59,927
Hey, it's not real.

1091
01:10:59,961 --> 01:11:00,795
Hit it.

1092
01:11:00,828 --> 01:11:01,662
Where?

1093
01:11:01,696 --> 01:11:02,530
Anywhere.

1094
01:11:02,563 --> 01:11:03,664
I don't wanna hit you.

1095
01:11:03,698 --> 01:11:05,066
Izzy.

1096
01:11:07,602 --> 01:11:08,401
Shit.

1097
01:11:08,435 --> 01:11:09,435
Sorry.

1098
01:11:13,941 --> 01:11:14,742
Ozzy.

1099
01:11:14,776 --> 01:11:15,777
Oscar.

1100
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:16,778
Ozzy.

1101
01:11:16,811 --> 01:11:17,811
Hey, hey.

1102
01:11:20,548 --> 01:11:21,548
I think you got it.

1103
01:11:22,617 --> 01:11:23,617
Okay.

1104
01:11:24,585 --> 01:11:26,087
Remind me not to
piss you off again.

1105
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:26,954
So what now?

1106
01:11:26,988 --> 01:11:28,523
His not up here.

1107
01:11:28,556 --> 01:11:30,825
There's still
one place we haven't looked.

1108
01:11:30,858 --> 01:11:31,859
Where?

1109
01:11:48,142 --> 01:11:49,811
She brought them back up here.

1110
01:11:51,979 --> 01:11:52,814
He's not here.

1111
01:11:52,847 --> 01:11:53,847
He has to be.

1112
01:11:59,854 --> 01:12:01,589
What are you thinking?

1113
01:12:01,622 --> 01:12:03,925
You wanna see her, you have
to get her attention, right?

1114
01:12:10,430 --> 01:12:12,432
What are you doing?

1115
01:12:12,465 --> 01:12:14,101
Getting their attention,

1116
01:12:14,135 --> 01:12:16,070
it's the only way
we're gonna find him.

1117
01:12:55,943 --> 01:12:56,943
No.

1118
01:12:58,045 --> 01:12:59,045
No, no.

1119
01:13:07,722 --> 01:13:08,722
Izzy.

1120
01:13:10,591 --> 01:13:11,591
Izzy?

1121
01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:15,997
Hey, hey, come on, come on.

1122
01:13:16,030 --> 01:13:21,035
Come on, come on, wake up.

1123
01:13:22,570 --> 01:13:23,570
Nothing.

1124
01:13:25,539 --> 01:13:26,807
You are nothing.

1125
01:13:28,643 --> 01:13:30,978
You will always have nothing.

1126
01:13:34,582 --> 01:13:37,652
Come to me, I can
give you a family.

1127
01:13:56,570 --> 01:13:58,072
No.

1128
01:13:58,105 --> 01:13:59,907
You can't trick me anymore.

1129
01:14:06,681 --> 01:14:07,515
You got it.

1130
01:14:07,548 --> 01:14:09,482
Okay, now destroy it.

1131
01:14:11,619 --> 01:14:12,687
Hey.

1132
01:14:13,788 --> 01:14:15,089
Heads up.

1133
01:14:21,595 --> 01:14:22,595
Izzy.

1134
01:14:23,264 --> 01:14:24,264
No.

1135
01:15:02,703 --> 01:15:03,304
Rick.

1136
01:15:03,337 --> 01:15:04,171
Rick.

1137
01:15:04,205 --> 01:15:05,673
Hey.

1138
01:15:05,706 --> 01:15:06,674
Hey, hey, come on, man.

1139
01:15:06,707 --> 01:15:07,541
Wake up.

1140
01:15:07,575 --> 01:15:08,609
Wake up, Rick.

1141
01:15:08,642 --> 01:15:09,877
- Come on.
- Come on, wake up.

1142
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:11,145
Come on man, wake up.

1143
01:15:11,178 --> 01:15:12,847
Come on, Rick.

1144
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,015
Come on man, come on.

1145
01:15:14,048 --> 01:15:14,949
Come on Rick, wake up.

1146
01:15:14,982 --> 01:15:16,022
- Come on.
- Wake up, Rick.

1147
01:15:20,021 --> 01:15:21,021
Who the hell did that?

1148
01:15:21,922 --> 01:15:22,990
What the hell was that?

1149
01:15:31,198 --> 01:15:32,666
Hey man.

1150
01:15:35,669 --> 01:15:36,670
Come here.

1151
01:15:37,972 --> 01:15:40,041
Get in here.

1152
01:15:43,377 --> 01:15:44,612
I missed you guys.

1153
01:16:36,397 --> 01:16:37,231
Okay, Rick, what
are you talking about?

1154
01:16:37,264 --> 01:16:38,899
You're not making sense.

1155
01:16:38,933 --> 01:16:41,402
Is there a red wire?

1156
01:16:41,435 --> 01:16:42,970
No.

1157
01:16:43,003 --> 01:16:44,371
Is there a blue wire?

1158
01:16:44,405 --> 01:16:45,405
Yes.

1159
01:16:46,874 --> 01:16:49,710
Are there any white wires?

1160
01:16:49,743 --> 01:16:50,743
No.

1161
01:16:53,114 --> 01:16:54,115
Cut the blue wire.

1162
01:16:59,954 --> 01:17:00,754
We blew up.

1163
01:17:00,788 --> 01:17:01,422
Son of a bitch.

1164
01:17:01,455 --> 01:17:02,823
What?

1165
01:17:02,857 --> 01:17:04,325
You told me to
cut the blue wire.

1166
01:17:04,358 --> 01:17:05,192
How many wires were there?

1167
01:17:05,226 --> 01:17:06,226
There were four.

1168
01:17:07,194 --> 01:17:08,796
You literally told
me five earlier.

1169
01:17:10,397 --> 01:17:12,299
Oh my god, can you
two shut up already.

1170
01:17:12,333 --> 01:17:14,101
He gave me the wrong information

1171
01:17:14,135 --> 01:17:15,269
and now we're dead.

1172
01:17:15,302 --> 01:17:16,379
Okay, now it's my
fault you didn't listen.

1173
01:17:16,403 --> 01:17:18,239
Listen man, I'm
telling you four wires.

1174
01:17:18,272 --> 01:17:20,708
Hey, don't you
guys start at 8:00?

1175
01:17:20,741 --> 01:17:22,243
We have a late start on Fridays.

1176
01:17:22,276 --> 01:17:24,812
Oh, what time you start then?

1177
01:17:24,845 --> 01:17:25,845
10:00.

1178
01:17:27,448 --> 01:17:28,448
It's 9:30.

1179
01:17:29,383 --> 01:17:31,051
Oh shit.

1180
01:17:31,085 --> 01:17:35,422
All right, we are off.

1181
01:17:35,456 --> 01:17:37,892
- See you tonight, Sam.
- See you Sam.

1182
01:17:37,925 --> 01:17:38,925
See ya.

1183
01:17:42,263 --> 01:17:43,397
What's wrong?

1184
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:46,100
There's actually
something I got to do.

1185
01:17:46,133 --> 01:17:47,801
Okay, but hurry up,
we're running late.

1186
01:17:47,835 --> 01:17:48,835
Yeah.

1187
01:17:50,871 --> 01:17:52,173
Hey, Sam.

1188
01:17:52,206 --> 01:17:53,206
Yeah, what's up?

1189
01:17:54,509 --> 01:17:56,243
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

1190
01:17:57,111 --> 01:17:58,279
For what?

1191
01:17:58,312 --> 01:17:59,780
When you brought me home,

1192
01:17:59,813 --> 01:18:01,191
you told me about everything
you did for everyone

1193
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:05,719
and about Evelyn, and I
never got to say I'm sorry.

1194
01:18:10,958 --> 01:18:12,960
She would've really like to you.

1195
01:18:13,994 --> 01:18:15,863
I'm sure I would've
loved her too.

1196
01:18:15,896 --> 01:18:17,064
Hey, Ben.

1197
01:18:17,097 --> 01:18:18,365
Yeah, yeah, I'm on my way.

1198
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:20,502
See you later, Sam.

1199
01:18:20,535 --> 01:18:21,535
See you.

1200
01:18:29,443 --> 01:18:32,112
So can I get a bed now?
