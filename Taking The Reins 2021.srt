weepin]

6
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,033
- Oh, yes!

7
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:32,867
It's just that was
a really hard jump

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,200
and she just cleared it.

9
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,734
- Wow, that's good then?
- It's great.

10
00:00:36,867 --> 00:00:38,667
So she just has to get through
the next round

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,500
without any faults,
and then she gets a ribbon.

12
00:00:41,633 --> 00:00:43,166
- Great.

13
00:00:45,867 --> 00:00:48,500
- I'm sorry, I get a little
carried away with this stuff.

14
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:52,033
- Oh, no problem.
So do you ride?

15
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:54,667
- I used to.
- Used to? Why'd you stop?

16
00:00:56,033 --> 00:00:57,066
- No reason.

17
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,567
I just stopped.

18
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,266
- And your online profile
says that you're a writer?

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,800
- I am.
I write for "Compass" magazine.

20
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:09,200
- Oh, yeah, I read that.
- Really?

21
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:11,567
- Yeah, have you written
anything I'd know?

22
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,100
- Well, I did a piece
on the history

23
00:01:14,233 --> 00:01:17,200
of personalized dinnerware.

24
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:20,433
Nope.
Okay, I did another story

25
00:01:20,567 --> 00:01:22,867
on therapeutic macrame.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,600
- I don't think I saw those.
- Well, now you'll never know

27
00:01:25,734 --> 00:01:27,800
the difference between
a square knot and a half hitch.

28
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:31,100
- Mm.

29
00:01:31,233 --> 00:01:32,567
Here we go.

30
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,734
Okay, there she goes.

31
00:01:35,867 --> 00:01:38,467
Ah, oh.

32
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,367
- Bad luck.
- Bad luck?

33
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,367
- Yeah, I mean,
she almost made it.

34
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,600
- People train their entire
lives for this.

35
00:01:45,734 --> 00:01:47,033
They give up their friends.

36
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:48,700
They give up their social lives.

37
00:01:48,834 --> 00:01:51,033
They give up anything
that isn't about winning.

38
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:53,767
So I wouldn't exactly
call it...luck.

39
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:56,200
- I didn't mean to say
that there wasn't

40
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:57,934
some skill involved.

41
00:01:59,367 --> 00:02:00,767
- I'm sorry.

42
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,100
- It's okay.
- No, I'm sorry.

43
00:02:03,233 --> 00:02:06,033
I get a little carried away
with this stuff.

44
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:08,033
Let's change the subject.
- Okay. Ha.

45
00:02:09,433 --> 00:02:11,500
Let's talk about you.
- Ha. Okay.

46
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:14,400
- So, um, how long have you
lived in the city, David?

47
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,700
- Actually, it's Paul.

48
00:02:28,633 --> 00:02:31,000
- You know, honey, we would
really love to see you.

49
00:02:31,133 --> 00:02:33,033
You're overdue for a visit.

50
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:35,133
- I know. I'm sorry.
I miss you, too.

51
00:02:35,266 --> 00:02:37,367
How's Dad? Alex?

52
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,000
- We have some big news.

53
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:41,133
Guess who's hosting
the championships this year.

54
00:02:41,266 --> 00:02:43,000
- What?

55
00:02:43,133 --> 00:02:44,467
- We didn't want to tell you
until we knew for sure.

56
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,533
But the Northeastern
Championships

57
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,000
are going to be held
right here at Meadowbrook.

58
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:52,200
- That is huge news!
That's incredible.

59
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,000
Who's riding?

60
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:55,800
Isn't it tradition for the host

61
00:02:55,934 --> 00:02:57,333
to have a rider
in the competition?

62
00:02:57,467 --> 00:02:59,834
- Mm-hmm.
And that would be your father.

63
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:02,033
- Dad is riding?

64
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,033
- We're gonna have the best in
the country competing right here

65
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,734
on the very course
where you used to ride.

66
00:03:07,867 --> 00:03:10,567
- Wow. How is he feeling?
Is he ready?

67
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,900
- Oh, hang on.
- Oh, no, it's okay.

68
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:14,333
- It's Sam.

69
00:03:14,467 --> 00:03:15,567
- Hi, Dad.

70
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,900
- Oh, hey, Sam.

71
00:03:18,033 --> 00:03:19,500
- Congrats on the event.

72
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:22,367
- Yep.
- Are you prepped? Ready?

73
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,567
- Getting there.

74
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,367
- Well, um,
who are you riding?

75
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,900
- Rascal.
- Oh, the new horse.

76
00:03:30,033 --> 00:03:31,533
I can't wait to meet him.

77
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:34,867
- Well, that would require
you coming home.

78
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:40,867
Yeah, um, I gotta go
check on the horses.

79
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,166
- Okay, honey.
- Bye, Sam.

80
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,867
- You do--you do that.
- Bye, Dad.

81
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,400
- He's got a lot on his mind.
- Yeah.

82
00:03:46,533 --> 00:03:49,900
I mean, well, you know,
he hasn't competed in years.

83
00:03:50,033 --> 00:03:51,834
- I'm sure he would love
to have you here

84
00:03:51,967 --> 00:03:55,033
cheering him on, honey.
In person.

85
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,400
- Depends on work.

86
00:03:56,533 --> 00:03:58,567
Speaking of,
I have to get to sleep.

87
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,500
I have a big meeting
in the morning with my editor.

88
00:04:00,633 --> 00:04:03,934
- Oh, okay.
Well, love you, honey.

89
00:04:04,066 --> 00:04:05,767
- I love you too.
Good night, Mom.

90
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,100
- How you doing, Rascal?

91
00:04:17,233 --> 00:04:19,266
Huh?

92
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,567
Want a little dessert?
There you go.

93
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,934
Yeah, that's my boy.

94
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:28,233
Oh, my boy.

95
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:30,567
- You can really be
an old bear sometimes.

96
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,100
- What are you talking about?

97
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:34,066
- I'm talking
about you and Samantha.

98
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,667
- Bonnie, come on. You know
I don't like that video stuff.

99
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,233
It's not personal.

100
00:04:38,367 --> 00:04:39,734
- So what was your excuse
when she came home

101
00:04:39,867 --> 00:04:41,500
in person last Christmas?

102
00:04:41,633 --> 00:04:43,800
Or Easter weekend?

103
00:04:43,934 --> 00:04:45,834
Or her birthday?

104
00:04:45,967 --> 00:04:48,500
- Bonnie, we don't have a whole
lot to talk about, that's all.

105
00:04:48,633 --> 00:04:50,066
- Well, you could have told her
what's going on.

106
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,967
- Why do I have to do it?

107
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,000
- She should hear it from you.

108
00:04:56,633 --> 00:04:58,700
- Am I really an old bear?

109
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,033
- Sometimes.

110
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,533
But you're my old bear.

111
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:10,133
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

112
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:13,900
But that due time,
don't make it past due.

113
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:20,867
- You too?

114
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,133
- Oh, Samantha.
- Yes?

115
00:05:24,266 --> 00:05:24,967
- I don't have much time today,

116
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,033
so we'll make this quick.
- Kay.

117
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,734
- It's about your travel story.

118
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:35,667
- Yes?
- No.

119
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,633
- No?
- Not for the cover.

120
00:05:37,767 --> 00:05:39,333
- Oh.

121
00:05:39,467 --> 00:05:41,633
- Look, Samantha,
you have talent.

122
00:05:41,767 --> 00:05:43,734
I could see that when you
were a freelancer for us.

123
00:05:43,867 --> 00:05:45,000
And I brought you on
as a staff writer

124
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:46,734
because I believe
in that talent.

125
00:05:46,867 --> 00:05:48,800
- And I really appreciate that.

126
00:05:48,934 --> 00:05:51,033
- But "Compass"
is a lifestyle magazine.

127
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,900
And our readers want to feel
that the stories

128
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:54,734
are coming
from your own experience.

129
00:05:54,867 --> 00:05:57,367
- I guess I just
felt like they were.

130
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,900
- They're very well
constructed.

131
00:05:59,033 --> 00:06:00,734
You're an excellent writer.

132
00:06:00,867 --> 00:06:03,967
But your stories don't feel
as if you've lived them.

133
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,100
That makes it difficult for our
readers to connect with you.

134
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,734
- My mother is famous
for her dinner parties.

135
00:06:09,867 --> 00:06:12,533
So I am very well versed
in personalized dinnerware.

136
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:14,800
That felt very real to me.

137
00:06:14,934 --> 00:06:16,734
But therapeutic macrame--

138
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:19,266
I can see how that
might not be a home run.

139
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:23,000
For anyone.

140
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:25,066
- Can I give you
a little advice?

141
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,700
- Please.

142
00:06:26,834 --> 00:06:27,967
- If you want to make the cover,

143
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,800
bring me a story
that only you can write.

144
00:06:30,934 --> 00:06:32,767
Bring me a story
with Samantha in it.

145
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,367
- Okay.
- Okay.

146
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,767
- Oh, what do you mean?

147
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,100
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

148
00:06:44,233 --> 00:06:45,967
I'm just trying
to find some empathy.

149
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,500
- Okay.
- Got it.

150
00:06:49,767 --> 00:06:52,700
You have a wall.

151
00:06:52,834 --> 00:06:54,967
You write from your head,
not your heart.

152
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,233
And if you can find a way
to break that wall, well,

153
00:06:58,367 --> 00:07:00,767
then I believe you can deliver
a cover-worthy story.

154
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:05,333
- Okay, um, thank you, Amanda.

155
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:10,100
I will get started
on the--my wall right away.

156
00:07:10,233 --> 00:07:12,133
- I feel really good about this.

157
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,333
We're done here.
- Oh, yeah, yes.

158
00:07:17,467 --> 00:07:19,467
Okay. Um, thank you.

159
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,367
- You need some more room?
You need some more?

160
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,567
You good, Shadow?

161
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,633
- Sorry.

162
00:07:31,767 --> 00:07:34,000
- You're gonna break his heart,
you know.

163
00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:36,533
You're not gonna come by
and say hello?

164
00:07:38,767 --> 00:07:41,033
- I am so sorry, Shadow.

165
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,500
Please forgive me.

166
00:07:43,633 --> 00:07:45,200
- Working on anything new
at the magazine?

167
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,367
- As a matter of fact, I am.

168
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,300
I just don't know
what that is yet.

169
00:07:49,433 --> 00:07:51,633
- Oh.

170
00:07:51,767 --> 00:07:53,367
Well, I'm sure you'll
figure something out.

171
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,100
Won't she, Shadow?

172
00:07:56,233 --> 00:07:58,500
- Yeah.

173
00:07:58,633 --> 00:08:00,400
- You sure do have
a way with horses.

174
00:08:02,867 --> 00:08:04,233
- Yes, I do.

175
00:08:08,367 --> 00:08:10,533
Thank you, Chauncey.
Thank you, Shadow.

176
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:12,433
- Not a problem.

177
00:08:12,567 --> 00:08:14,767
Have a good day, Sam.

178
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,834
- That's very exciting.
I can't wait.

179
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:23,734
Yeah, that'd be terrific.

180
00:08:23,867 --> 00:08:24,867
All right, I can't wait
to see you.

181
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,233
Drive safely.

182
00:08:27,367 --> 00:08:29,033
Love you.

183
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,567
- Is Sam coming home?

184
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,100
- Your sister
is writing an article

185
00:08:33,233 --> 00:08:35,767
about the Northeastern
Championships for her magazine.

186
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,533
- How long's she gonna be here?

187
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:40,900
- A couple of weeks, I think.

188
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:42,834
- Wait.

189
00:08:42,967 --> 00:08:44,700
You guys have told her,
haven't you?

190
00:08:44,834 --> 00:08:47,000
About Luke?

191
00:08:47,133 --> 00:08:50,233
- Uh, not--not in so many words.

192
00:08:50,367 --> 00:08:51,900
Right, dear?

193
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:54,500
I mean, she can just
find out when she gets here.

194
00:08:54,633 --> 00:08:56,934
It'll make for a nice surprise.

195
00:08:57,066 --> 00:08:58,600
- Most people know

196
00:08:58,734 --> 00:09:01,800
they don't surprise someone
with their ex-husband.

197
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,000
- That went well.

198
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,500
- I should warn you, Samantha.

199
00:09:16,633 --> 00:09:18,934
I have very high expectations
for this article.

200
00:09:19,066 --> 00:09:20,734
- Well, I am just really happy

201
00:09:20,867 --> 00:09:23,100
that you're interested
in the story.

202
00:09:23,233 --> 00:09:26,967
- Equestrian events are elegant,
expensive, and iconic.

203
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,767
They're perfect
for the "Compass" brand.

204
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,800
- Even for the cover?

205
00:09:31,934 --> 00:09:34,300
- We can talk about that
after you submit the story.

206
00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:35,934
Keep your receipts.

207
00:09:36,066 --> 00:09:38,767
- Will do.
Thank you so much, Amanda.

208
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,834
- Is something different
with the blueberries?

209
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:02,667
I think it makes
a world of difference.

210
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,467
I will be right with you.
- Ashley.

211
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,066
Hi.
- Oh, my gosh.

212
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,900
Samantha, hi.
- How are you?

213
00:10:11,033 --> 00:10:12,333
- So good. How are you?

214
00:10:12,467 --> 00:10:15,233
- I don't think I've seen you
since...Fairfield?

215
00:10:15,367 --> 00:10:17,266
- Has it been that long?
- I think so.

216
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,133
- Some days I barely remember
I even went to college.

217
00:10:20,266 --> 00:10:21,934
- Same.

218
00:10:22,066 --> 00:10:25,266
Do you work here now?
- Kind of.

219
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,767
I own the place.

220
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,166
- I bought it from Ed Crawford

221
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,266
last year.
- That is amazing.

222
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,166
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

223
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,100
So what brings you to town?

224
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:37,633
You moved to New York, right?

225
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:39,767
- Yes, writing assignment.
- Oh.

226
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,467
- I am doing a story
on the championships

227
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,900
at my parents' place.
- That's exciting.

228
00:10:44,033 --> 00:10:46,300
- Um, I have to ask.

229
00:10:46,433 --> 00:10:51,100
Ed used to make these insanely
delicious cinnamon rolls?

230
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,166
- Yeah, I had a feeling
you were gonna ask about them.

231
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,767
I have the recipe.

232
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,734
- I will take a half a dozen.
- Coming up.

233
00:10:56,867 --> 00:10:58,934
- Great.

234
00:10:59,066 --> 00:11:01,333
- They're just out of the oven.

235
00:11:01,467 --> 00:11:03,567
- These--these pictures
are beautiful.

236
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,700
Who took these?

237
00:11:05,834 --> 00:11:07,367
- Actually, I did.

238
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,233
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

239
00:11:09,367 --> 00:11:11,367
- They're really beautiful.
You have such a good eye.

240
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,166
- Really?
- Yeah.

241
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,166
- Thank you.

242
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,533
One day, I just picked up
a camera and started shooting.

243
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:19,700
Figured I was never gonna
do anything with them,

244
00:11:19,834 --> 00:11:22,900
so I figured
I'd just decorate the place.

245
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
- That's Luke.

246
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,533
- Hmm?

247
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,633
- Luke Travers.

248
00:11:33,767 --> 00:11:35,967
We used to be married.

249
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,066
- Right, yeah, of course.
I--I knew that.

250
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,400
I, uh, bumped into him
at the park

251
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:44,333
and I snapped it there.

252
00:11:44,467 --> 00:11:46,400
- It's a really nice
shot of him.

253
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:49,233
- Order's ready.

254
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:50,333
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

255
00:11:50,467 --> 00:11:52,300
On the house, Sam.

256
00:11:52,433 --> 00:11:53,533
- Really?
- Yeah, of course.

257
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:55,000
- Thank you so much.

258
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:56,233
- Say hi to your mom
and dad for me, okay.

259
00:11:56,367 --> 00:11:58,133
- I will, I will.
Good to see you.

260
00:11:58,266 --> 00:12:00,567
- Bye.
- Yeah, bye.

261
00:12:27,867 --> 00:12:30,033
- I want the larger tent
on the north lawn,

262
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,300
lights along all the walkways
in the perimeter.

263
00:12:32,433 --> 00:12:33,734
And let's set up both bars

264
00:12:33,867 --> 00:12:35,967
on opposite sides
of the east lawn.

265
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,567
But I don't want it
too close to the edge.

266
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,233
Did you all get that?
Okay, good.

267
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:41,100
'Cause I don't want anyone
falling off the edge.

268
00:12:41,233 --> 00:12:42,400
Excuse me.

269
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:44,400
- Hi, Mom.
- You're early!

270
00:12:44,533 --> 00:12:46,800
- Well, for once,
traffic was actually good.

271
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:48,200
I'll just get my stuff later.

272
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,600
Hi.

273
00:12:49,734 --> 00:12:51,633
- Oh, it's so good to see you.

274
00:12:51,767 --> 00:12:53,467
- Oh, it's so good
to see you too.

275
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,300
- In person.

276
00:12:55,433 --> 00:12:57,767
I mean, that face camera thing
is all right

277
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,767
every once in a while,
but I like to hug my baby.

278
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,667
- I know, me too.

279
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,000
- Yay.

280
00:13:03,133 --> 00:13:05,500
Okay, I have your room
set up for you.

281
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,100
I hear footsteps.

282
00:13:55,233 --> 00:13:56,867
I thought I heard you

283
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,433
driving in.

284
00:13:59,567 --> 00:14:02,233
- How's my favorite sister?

285
00:14:02,367 --> 00:14:03,934
- Well, since I'm your
only sister,

286
00:14:04,066 --> 00:14:05,667
I'll say that I'm great.

287
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,200
I am so glad that you're here.

288
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,033
- Me too.
- Mom and Dad too.

289
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,900
- Dad said that?
- Of course not.

290
00:14:11,033 --> 00:14:12,600
Though he might
have told a horse.

291
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm gonna go see the horses.
- Yeah, yeah.

292
00:14:16,133 --> 00:14:17,700
Hi. Yes.

293
00:14:21,867 --> 00:14:26,166
Hey, Buttercup.
Oh, you pretty thing.

294
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,734
Hi.

295
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,667
Where's the new guy, huh?
Where's Rascal?

296
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,433
- They wouldn't tell you
if they could.

297
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:36,500
Horses keep their secrets.

298
00:14:36,633 --> 00:14:39,400
- One of my dad's
favorite expressions.

299
00:14:39,533 --> 00:14:40,734
- I've only been here a month,

300
00:14:40,867 --> 00:14:42,200
but I guess
he's rubbing off on me.

301
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,867
- Sorry about that.
- It's okay.

302
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,834
- I'm Sam,
I'm the oldest daughter.

303
00:14:46,967 --> 00:14:49,333
- Matthew.
It's nice to finally meet you.

304
00:14:49,467 --> 00:14:50,567
- Aw.
- They talk about you

305
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,233
all the time around here.

306
00:14:52,367 --> 00:14:54,266
Your dad says you used to be one
of the best riders in the state.

307
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,934
- Well, I--I don't know--

308
00:14:56,066 --> 00:14:57,600
- She was the best.

309
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:01,133
- Hey, Dad.

310
00:15:02,867 --> 00:15:04,600
- Yeah, glad to see you.

311
00:15:04,734 --> 00:15:08,133
Your mother's been looking
forward to this all week.

312
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:14,000
- So you don't ride anymore.
- No.

313
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:16,734
I stopped a--a few years ago.

314
00:15:16,867 --> 00:15:19,767
Yeah, it's kind of
a long story, so--

315
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,467
- And we got a lot of work
to do, so Matt, come on.

316
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,633
Trucks arrive tomorrow
to start setting things up.

317
00:15:24,767 --> 00:15:26,834
- Pretty exciting, though?
Having the championships here.

318
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,133
- It is at that.

319
00:15:29,266 --> 00:15:30,600
See you at dinner.

320
00:15:30,734 --> 00:15:32,400
Matt.

321
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:34,166
- It was nice to meet you, Sam.

322
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,133
- Yeah, you too.

323
00:15:41,767 --> 00:15:43,266
- I don't know.

324
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,333
Let me check on that
and I will call you back. Bye.

325
00:15:45,467 --> 00:15:47,333
- Hey, Alex, would you take
these up to Sam, please?

326
00:15:47,467 --> 00:15:48,600
- She's not up there.

327
00:15:48,734 --> 00:15:49,633
She just went out
to the stables.

328
00:15:49,767 --> 00:15:51,567
- Already?

329
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,233
- Mom.

330
00:15:53,367 --> 00:15:55,734
- I meant to tell her.
- You should have.

331
00:15:55,867 --> 00:15:58,133
But since you didn't,
let's go tell her now

332
00:15:58,266 --> 00:16:00,633
so I can be there for it.

333
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,433
- Oh.

334
00:16:04,033 --> 00:16:06,233
Hi, buddy.

335
00:16:06,367 --> 00:16:08,533
I've waiting to meet you--

336
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,667
- Hi.

337
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,066
- Hi?

338
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,367
Luke, what are you doing here?

339
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,800
- What do you mean?

340
00:16:17,934 --> 00:16:20,300
- I mean, what are you
doing here, Luke?

341
00:16:20,433 --> 00:16:22,200
- Nobody told you, did they?

342
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:25,166
- Told me what?

343
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,600
- Your dad hired me to
train him for the competition.

344
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:32,767
I'm the new trainer.

345
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,266
Sam.

346
00:16:44,533 --> 00:16:46,567
Sam, wait.
- What?

347
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,467
- Is that all you're gonna say?

348
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,900
- What else do you
want me to say?

349
00:16:50,033 --> 00:16:53,300
- I don't know.
Something more than "What?"

350
00:16:53,433 --> 00:16:54,734
- This whole entire thing
has caught me

351
00:16:54,867 --> 00:16:56,200
completely off guard, Luke.

352
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:59,567
- Okay, for real,
nobody told you I was here?

353
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,467
- Nope.
- Okay. Then I apologize.

354
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,900
I mean, when your mother told me
that you were coming up here

355
00:17:06,033 --> 00:17:06,967
to write your article,
I just, I don't know,

356
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,734
I assumed that somebody
would have told you.

357
00:17:08,867 --> 00:17:10,266
- One would have thought,
right?

358
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,734
- Okay, it's my fault.

359
00:17:11,867 --> 00:17:14,266
- Oh.
- My fault, I'm afraid.

360
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,900
I was planning
on telling you but--

361
00:17:16,033 --> 00:17:17,867
- She chickened out.
- I didn't chicken out, no.

362
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,367
I did not chicken out,
thank you.

363
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,834
I was just waiting
for the perfect moment.

364
00:17:23,266 --> 00:17:24,600
Turns out there is none.

365
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,166
- Can I have a word with you
in private, please?

366
00:17:30,734 --> 00:17:31,967
Oh, no. Oh, no.

367
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,600
Sir, excuse me.

368
00:17:34,734 --> 00:17:37,233
I would like to speak
to you too.

369
00:17:39,734 --> 00:17:41,967
- Do either one of you
care to explain to me

370
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,533
what my ex-husband
is doing here?

371
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:46,066
- Look,
I don't need to tell you

372
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,533
it's been years
since I competed.

373
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:50,200
You're not around to ride.

374
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,967
So I had no choice
but to step in.

375
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,300
And I need somebody to help me
who understands our horses.

376
00:17:54,433 --> 00:17:55,934
And that's Luke.

377
00:17:56,066 --> 00:17:58,233
- Look, seriously, Sam, if
this is gonna be a problem--

378
00:17:58,367 --> 00:18:01,767
- I told them to tell you.
- You could have told me.

379
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,400
- What do you not understand
about a sidebar?

380
00:18:07,734 --> 00:18:08,633
Thank you.

381
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:11,300
- Okay, Sam, look.

382
00:18:11,433 --> 00:18:15,033
I'm sorry.
We should've told you.

383
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,200
We just didn't think
you were coming home.

384
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,800
And then when you did, I--

385
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:22,367
I didn't know how to tell you.

386
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,433
And the truth is we need Luke.

387
00:18:24,567 --> 00:18:26,800
You know how important
this event is.

388
00:18:26,934 --> 00:18:29,033
And the best trainer
in the whole state

389
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,500
just happens
to be your ex-husband.

390
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:34,533
- Yes, of course I know
how important this event is.

391
00:18:34,667 --> 00:18:37,934
And Dad, I want you to win.

392
00:18:38,066 --> 00:18:39,600
- It's just two weeks.
- I--

393
00:18:39,734 --> 00:18:41,000
- But if this really, really,

394
00:18:41,133 --> 00:18:42,967
really, really
is difficult for you,

395
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,333
we'll just call
the whole thing off.

396
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:48,133
- Mom, it's too late for that.

397
00:18:48,266 --> 00:18:50,100
I mean,
hundreds of people are coming.

398
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:52,300
You and Alex
have worked so hard.

399
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:57,500
Look, we are both adults.

400
00:18:57,633 --> 00:19:01,333
Like you said,
it's just two weeks.

401
00:19:01,467 --> 00:19:04,433
If he can do it, so can I.

402
00:19:04,567 --> 00:19:06,200
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

403
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,900
- Thank you.

404
00:19:08,033 --> 00:19:10,066
- Now, if you will excuse me,

405
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,934
I think I'm going to go
upstairs and unpack.

406
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,467
- One--I do one thing well.
- There we go.

407
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,900
- There she is.

408
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,867
- Sorry.

409
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,800
Took a minute to settle in.

410
00:20:03,934 --> 00:20:05,433
- Hmm.

411
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:08,433
Let me guess, you over-packed.

412
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:10,333
Like that time
we went to Hawaii.

413
00:20:10,467 --> 00:20:12,533
- You say over-packed,
I say prepared.

414
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:16,300
So you had no other
dinner plans tonight?

415
00:20:16,433 --> 00:20:17,967
- None that compared
to your mother's yams.

416
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,133
- Since when did you
start liking yams?

417
00:20:20,266 --> 00:20:24,300
- Oh, when I had them the way
your mom prepares them.

418
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:26,333
- Thank you, Luke.
- Of course.

419
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:38,333
- So how is the training
going for the championships?

420
00:20:38,467 --> 00:20:41,867
- Well, Luke thinks Rascal
has a real shot at the win.

421
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,700
- Yeah, he is
a solid contender.

422
00:20:43,834 --> 00:20:46,000
- Hmm, so you guys are just
out there, you know,

423
00:20:46,133 --> 00:20:48,166
running the course
over and over and over again?

424
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,633
- Well, yes and no.

425
00:20:49,767 --> 00:20:51,600
I mean, Preston
loves the repetition.

426
00:20:51,734 --> 00:20:53,667
- Because it works.
Right, Dad?

427
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,266
- Yams, please.

428
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,700
- But this time, he has agreed
to a mixture of training.

429
00:20:58,834 --> 00:21:01,600
Repetition and learning
the value

430
00:21:01,734 --> 00:21:05,033
of forming an emotional
connection with your horse.

431
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:07,066
- Wow.
- Oh, here we go again.

432
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,900
- Yeah, and that horse
this time is Rascal,

433
00:21:09,033 --> 00:21:10,867
who is taking to it very well.

434
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,166
And the more time I spend
with them, the better they get.

435
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,200
You know, I find that

436
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:19,166
just doing the same thing
over and over and over again

437
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,533
without having an emotional
connection doesn't really work.

438
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:26,367
- I would say if there's
an actual emotional connection,

439
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,533
then you don't need to learn,
you just know.

440
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:32,166
- And--and how would one know

441
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,066
if the other one
doesn't let that one in?

442
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,834
- Well, how is anyone
supposed to know anything

443
00:21:36,967 --> 00:21:38,433
when the other
just keeps walking away

444
00:21:38,567 --> 00:21:40,667
when things get sticky?

445
00:21:48,567 --> 00:21:50,000
- Talking about horses,
of course.

446
00:21:50,133 --> 00:21:52,200
- Yeah, me too.
- Of course.

447
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,600
- Can someone pass me the yams?

448
00:21:54,734 --> 00:21:57,400
- Mm, yeah. Here you go.

449
00:21:57,533 --> 00:21:59,233
- Thank you.
- Sweetie, brussels sprouts.

450
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,500
- That's terrible.

451
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,633
Hi.
- Hi.

452
00:22:19,767 --> 00:22:22,133
You still up?
- Mm-hmm.

453
00:22:22,266 --> 00:22:25,767
Trying to write unsuccessfully.

454
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,266
Well, dinner was fun.

455
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,000
That's why I'm here.

456
00:22:29,133 --> 00:22:30,734
- Sorry.

457
00:22:30,867 --> 00:22:32,633
I do want to apologize--
- Mm-hmm?

458
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:34,400
- For not telling you
about Luke.

459
00:22:34,533 --> 00:22:36,166
They shouldn't have
ambushed you like that.

460
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,400
It wasn't fair.

461
00:22:38,533 --> 00:22:40,800
Funny but not fair.

462
00:22:40,934 --> 00:22:44,100
No, it wasn't.

463
00:22:44,233 --> 00:22:46,300
Thank you.
I appreciate the apology.

464
00:22:46,433 --> 00:22:48,100
- Mm-hmm?
- Mm-hmm.

465
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:50,967
- But Dad really
does need Luke, so--

466
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,734
you know how good he is.

467
00:22:52,867 --> 00:22:54,400
- I know how stubborn he is.

468
00:22:54,533 --> 00:22:55,934
- Oh. Ha.

469
00:22:56,066 --> 00:22:59,066
I forget how much you two
push each other's buttons.

470
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,567
- Mm.

471
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,166
Does he have dinner here a lot?

472
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,533
- Yes, all the time.

473
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:07,633
I keep telling Dad
he should just

474
00:23:07,767 --> 00:23:09,900
put a kitchen
in the carriage house.

475
00:23:10,033 --> 00:23:12,967
- I'm sorry, what?

476
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,667
- Hmm?

477
00:23:36,367 --> 00:23:39,000
- You are the gift that
keeps on giving aren't you?

478
00:23:42,266 --> 00:23:45,367
- Yes, please come
inside my humble abode.

479
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,800
- Did you--what,
are you living here now too?

480
00:23:47,934 --> 00:23:51,367
- Know what?

481
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,033
You look like you need a drink.

482
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:54,667
- What happened
to our old place, Luke?

483
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,333
- No, that place
stopped being ours

484
00:23:56,467 --> 00:23:57,667
a long time before I moved out.

485
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,233
- Don't do that, don't deflect.

486
00:24:00,367 --> 00:24:02,400
- Okay, you know what?
This whole thing, here?

487
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:04,400
Me living here?
This was your dad's idea.

488
00:24:04,533 --> 00:24:06,533
Because, I don't know, I'm just
working here 100 hours a week.

489
00:24:06,667 --> 00:24:09,867
But maybe it makes
too much sense.

490
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,767
I'll just go, okay?

491
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,734
- Great. Great. Just walk away.
Yep.

492
00:24:13,867 --> 00:24:15,867
'Cause you know what?
Things got sticky.

493
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,934
- Sam, what do you want?
Stay or go?

494
00:24:18,066 --> 00:24:20,867
Because I'm not a mind reader.
I never have been.

495
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,600
- I want you to want
to stay here

496
00:24:22,734 --> 00:24:24,967
and figure this out with me.

497
00:24:31,567 --> 00:24:33,934
- You want that drink now?
- Yes.

498
00:24:34,066 --> 00:24:35,967
- Okay.

499
00:24:51,934 --> 00:24:54,367
- You kept Winston.

500
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,333
- I couldn't bear
to part with him.

501
00:25:07,734 --> 00:25:12,100
Do you remember how we would
just snuggle ourselves onto him

502
00:25:12,233 --> 00:25:16,633
and watch movies for hours?

503
00:25:16,767 --> 00:25:19,100
- Yes, I do.

504
00:25:19,233 --> 00:25:22,166
I also remember returning
a very expensive,

505
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,600
super comfortable couch

506
00:25:23,734 --> 00:25:26,000
that your parents gave us
for our wedding just--

507
00:25:26,133 --> 00:25:28,633
just so we can--
we can hang on to this guy.

508
00:25:28,767 --> 00:25:30,633
So, yeah.

509
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,000
- How are we gonna do this?

510
00:25:41,133 --> 00:25:43,100
How are we supposed
to peacefully coexist

511
00:25:43,233 --> 00:25:45,700
living next door to each other
for the next two weeks?

512
00:25:48,266 --> 00:25:50,000
- I don't know.

513
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,567
- Good, good, good.
Keep your leg on.

514
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,133
That first one was beautiful.

515
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,600
Good, good, just like that.

516
00:26:11,734 --> 00:26:14,100
When we go to the show,
I want it just like that.

517
00:26:18,066 --> 00:26:19,734
He's great, isn't he?

518
00:26:19,867 --> 00:26:21,600
Takes those fences
with confidence.

519
00:26:21,734 --> 00:26:23,400
Not too showy.

520
00:26:23,533 --> 00:26:26,967
- Graceful, effortless.

521
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,567
- I think he's got
a real shot at this.

522
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,233
- It's a beautiful horse.

523
00:26:30,367 --> 00:26:34,800
- I was talking about your dad.

524
00:26:34,934 --> 00:26:36,667
You think he could
really do this?

525
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,934
I mean, it's been a long time.

526
00:26:39,066 --> 00:26:41,567
- Most men his age have
already hung up their boots.

527
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,467
But with his experience
and that horse,

528
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,967
I do think anything can happen.

529
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,967
Really do.

530
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,967
Good.

531
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,633
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- You looked good out there.

532
00:26:54,767 --> 00:26:56,500
For a man...

533
00:26:56,633 --> 00:26:58,734
- For what?

534
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,133
- A man of a certain vintage.

535
00:27:01,266 --> 00:27:02,834
Dad, are you sure about this?

536
00:27:02,967 --> 00:27:04,700
You could fall,
you could get thrown off.

537
00:27:04,834 --> 00:27:07,233
- I--I could also win.

538
00:27:07,367 --> 00:27:11,333
Of course, you could take him
through the course if you want.

539
00:27:11,467 --> 00:27:13,333
I've still got your old saddle
in the tack room.

540
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:18,300
- I'm afraid it's gonna
have to stay there.

541
00:27:18,433 --> 00:27:20,066
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

542
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,867
I gotta get back to work.

543
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:31,333
- She could've made
Nationals, you know.

544
00:27:31,467 --> 00:27:33,734
Maybe even the Olympics.
- Yeah, I know.

545
00:27:36,367 --> 00:27:38,367
Think she'll ever ride again?

546
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,333
- That's up to her.

547
00:27:41,467 --> 00:27:43,000
One more, come on.
- Yeah.

548
00:27:43,133 --> 00:27:44,767
- Let's go.

549
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,500
- This first fence,
go with him.

550
00:27:50,633 --> 00:27:52,700
- That goes to the back
of the house. All right.

551
00:27:52,834 --> 00:27:55,800
And that goes to the west side.
Thank you.

552
00:27:55,934 --> 00:27:58,200
And we need to make sure they--

553
00:27:58,333 --> 00:27:59,834
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

554
00:27:59,967 --> 00:28:01,200
Wait, wait, that goes
to the kitchen.

555
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:03,100
The kitchen, please.
Thanks.

556
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,100
- Get a load of this.
Your mom is amazing.

557
00:28:08,233 --> 00:28:09,800
She is running this place
like an army general.

558
00:28:09,934 --> 00:28:12,734
- The championships
get a lot of attention.

559
00:28:12,867 --> 00:28:14,567
Mom and Dad are definitely
stepping up their game.

560
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,600
You know they're getting
the awards banquet

561
00:28:15,734 --> 00:28:18,133
catered by the Stone Hearth.
- What's that?

562
00:28:18,266 --> 00:28:19,867
- You don't know what
the Stone Hearth is?

563
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,266
- Sorry, no.
- It's like a really amazing

564
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,800
restaurant in the city.

565
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:25,066
It's got great food.
Good atmosphere.

566
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,033
- Huh, sounds like
a perfect date spot.

567
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:30,000
See ya.

568
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,233
- Did he just ask me out?

569
00:28:42,033 --> 00:28:43,900
- Oh.

570
00:28:50,667 --> 00:28:52,600
- Writer's block?
- Yes.

571
00:28:52,734 --> 00:28:55,300
- Let's go get a drink.

572
00:28:58,533 --> 00:28:59,633
- Thanks, Nick.
- Thank you.

573
00:28:59,767 --> 00:29:02,433
Appreciate it.

574
00:29:02,567 --> 00:29:06,300
Well, the real question is,
what do you want to do?

575
00:29:06,433 --> 00:29:08,533
- Well, if I knew that
I would probably be doing it.

576
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:14,500
Well, have you thought
about going back to school?

577
00:29:14,633 --> 00:29:16,266
- Ha, why?

578
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,800
So I can get another degree
that I'm not going to use?

579
00:29:18,934 --> 00:29:20,533
- Yeah, that's true.

580
00:29:20,667 --> 00:29:23,033
- I just feel like
I'm spinning my tires, you know?

581
00:29:23,166 --> 00:29:26,033
- Maybe you should talk to Dad.

582
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:28,967
- Our dad?
- Good point, yeah.

583
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,967
- No, he still thinks
I'm his baby.

584
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,633
Like he cannot understand
why I would want to do anything

585
00:29:34,767 --> 00:29:37,300
other than balance the books
at the family business.

586
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:43,800
Boom!

587
00:29:43,934 --> 00:29:45,300
- Close.

588
00:29:45,433 --> 00:29:47,300
- Is that Matthew, the new guy?

589
00:29:47,433 --> 00:29:49,467
- Hmm?

590
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,734
- I mean--

591
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,800
- Mm-hmm.

592
00:29:52,934 --> 00:29:54,867
- What is this?
- Hmm?

593
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,300
- Do you like him?

594
00:29:56,433 --> 00:29:58,800
- He kinda, sorta,
maybe not really,

595
00:29:58,934 --> 00:30:00,834
asked me out today.

596
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:04,000
- I'm gonna need you
to elaborate on that.

597
00:30:04,133 --> 00:30:05,934
- Okay, so I was talking up
Stone Hearth.

598
00:30:06,066 --> 00:30:11,266
And then he said that it sounds
like the perfect date spot.

599
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,367
Like, that's what
that means, right?

600
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:18,500
- Sister, the boss's daughter
might be a conflict of interest.

601
00:30:18,633 --> 00:30:20,767
- I'm working all the time.

602
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,767
So if I can't meet somebody
in my backyard,

603
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,967
where am I supposed to meet 'em?
- No, mm-mm.

604
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:28,133
- Tell me.

605
00:30:29,066 --> 00:30:30,834
Oh, hey, there's Luke.
- Mm.

606
00:30:34,767 --> 00:30:36,967
- Oh.

607
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:40,667
That is an interesting
new development, um...

608
00:30:44,266 --> 00:30:45,834
I'm sure it's nothing serious.

609
00:30:45,967 --> 00:30:48,033
- It's fine, it's fine.

610
00:30:48,166 --> 00:30:50,934
We're not married anymore.

611
00:30:51,066 --> 00:30:54,266
He is free to live his own life.

612
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,367
- He is.

613
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,867
- I just don't know why he has
to live it in this bar.

614
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,734
- I mean, honestly.

615
00:31:00,867 --> 00:31:03,266
There are so many places to go.

616
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,066
Well, not within
a 26-mile radius.

617
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,400
But like, drive, you know?

618
00:31:20,333 --> 00:31:22,333
- Can I have two more
glasses of wine, please?

619
00:31:22,467 --> 00:31:23,367
Thanks.

620
00:31:28,567 --> 00:31:30,734
Hey.
- Hey.

621
00:31:30,867 --> 00:31:33,600
- Didn't think I'd see you here.

622
00:31:33,734 --> 00:31:36,266
- I saw you.

623
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,066
- Oh, uh, that's Ashley.

624
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,400
She bought--
- Black Walnut, yeah, I know.

625
00:31:43,567 --> 00:31:46,567
- I'll take another, please.

626
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,266
- Hey, I'm happy for you.

627
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,100
Ashley's really nice.

628
00:31:50,233 --> 00:31:52,333
- Oh no. No, no, no, no.
That's not what it is.

629
00:31:52,467 --> 00:31:54,233
We've been on
a couple of dates.

630
00:31:54,367 --> 00:31:55,767
It's--no, it's not serious.

631
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,967
- Serious enough to put
your picture on her wall.

632
00:31:59,867 --> 00:32:02,166
- Okay.

633
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,767
What about you?

634
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,734
- Oh, I definitely took
your pictures down from my wall.

635
00:32:05,867 --> 00:32:08,000
- Ha. Ha ha.
Not what I meant.

636
00:32:08,133 --> 00:32:09,734
Are you seeing anyone?

637
00:32:09,867 --> 00:32:12,033
- Oh, oh.

638
00:32:14,033 --> 00:32:17,166
Um...here and there.

639
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,333
Nothing serious.

640
00:32:23,967 --> 00:32:25,300
- Music's good tonight.

641
00:32:25,433 --> 00:32:26,667
- I miss that.

642
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,000
- What?

643
00:32:30,133 --> 00:32:32,100
What do you miss?
- Nothing.

644
00:32:32,233 --> 00:32:33,633
- No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

645
00:32:33,767 --> 00:32:35,967
I'm not gonna let you do that.

646
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,734
What were you gonna say?

647
00:32:38,867 --> 00:32:42,066
- I miss, um, you know, us...

648
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,800
dancing.

649
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,800
Like that.

650
00:32:50,066 --> 00:32:51,934
I'm sorry.
I'm--I'm sorry.

651
00:32:52,066 --> 00:32:55,467
I mean, I shouldn't, 'cause
you're on--I just--it's--

652
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,967
It's weird being here with you

653
00:33:00,166 --> 00:33:02,567
but not being with you.

654
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,233
And--and the last time
I danced like that was--

655
00:33:05,367 --> 00:33:07,867
- Before we broke up.

656
00:33:10,834 --> 00:33:12,500
- I don't remember it
being a "we."

657
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,834
- Wow, um...

658
00:33:18,967 --> 00:33:21,400
Sam, I just--

659
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:23,500
I just didn't know

660
00:33:23,633 --> 00:33:25,867
how to help you find
what you were looking for.

661
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,700
That's all.
I, um...

662
00:33:30,834 --> 00:33:34,367
- Hey, it's okay.
You know, we were young.

663
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,967
We couldn't expect
to figure each other out

664
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,633
when we barely knew ourselves.
So--

665
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,467
- Well, talking about it
kind of helps.

666
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,967
- I thought I tried.
I mean,

667
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,934
I just felt like you
didn't want to listen.

668
00:33:45,967 --> 00:33:48,333
- Right.

669
00:33:48,467 --> 00:33:50,467
Well, it's hard constantly
feeling like

670
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,033
you're failing the person
that you love, you know.

671
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:55,900
- I never said that.

672
00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:59,367
I never said you failed.

673
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,633
- I know.

674
00:34:02,567 --> 00:34:06,567
But you never really said
I succeeded either.

675
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,867
Anyway, I should go.

676
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,100
And, uh, enjoy your evening.

677
00:34:52,133 --> 00:34:54,600
- Oh, that's so true.
- You have such a good memory.

678
00:34:54,734 --> 00:34:56,166
- That horse was like clockwork.

679
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,834
He would know exactly what time
she got home from school.

680
00:34:58,967 --> 00:35:00,734
- He really did.

681
00:35:00,867 --> 00:35:02,700
- Oh, oh, we can't put the
Bevels with the Warner Smiths.

682
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:04,400
They aren't speaking
after that unfortunate

683
00:35:04,533 --> 00:35:06,266
tree trimming incident
last spring.

684
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,100
- Oh, forgive me.
- Let's move 'em over here.

685
00:35:08,233 --> 00:35:10,233
- Good morning.

686
00:35:10,367 --> 00:35:13,033
Are we planning a dinner party
or invading New Hampshire?

687
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:14,300
A little bit of both.

688
00:35:15,667 --> 00:35:17,233
- Good morning.

689
00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:20,266
Late night?
- Nope.

690
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,400
Your mother was just telling us
about your first horse.

691
00:35:22,533 --> 00:35:24,834
- Oh, yeah,
I still miss Midnight.

692
00:35:24,967 --> 00:35:27,266
- Talk about
an emotional connection.

693
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,066
You used to ride him

694
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,934
without putting your feet
in the stirrups.

695
00:35:31,066 --> 00:35:33,367
- Mm-hmm.
- I forgot about that.

696
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,166
- I liked the freedom.

697
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,033
Just the two of us
riding for fun.

698
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:39,934
- Yeah, but her father
didn't think so.

699
00:35:40,066 --> 00:35:44,433
- We used to hear him yelling
at her from up at the house.

700
00:35:44,567 --> 00:35:46,834
"Put your feet
in those stirrups, young lady."

701
00:35:46,967 --> 00:35:50,600
- I didn't sound like that.

702
00:35:50,734 --> 00:35:53,000
- Did I?
- Absolutely.

703
00:35:53,133 --> 00:35:54,734
- It was a little dangerous,

704
00:35:54,867 --> 00:35:56,500
but it wasn't the worst thing
I could've done.

705
00:35:56,633 --> 00:35:58,567
- No. No, it wasn't.

706
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,133
Well, I better go wash up.

707
00:36:02,266 --> 00:36:04,800
Good morning, everyone.

708
00:36:04,934 --> 00:36:06,700
You all have some fun.

709
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:11,367
- Good morning, indeed.

710
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,600
- Kinda harsh on you.
- That's my dad.

711
00:36:35,734 --> 00:36:37,900
Everyone says he has
a hard time with emotions.

712
00:36:38,033 --> 00:36:40,000
But he doesn't have
trouble reminding me

713
00:36:40,133 --> 00:36:42,800
of how I let him down.

714
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:44,633
- How's your article going?
- Oh, it's not.

715
00:36:44,767 --> 00:36:46,667
It's not at all, no.

716
00:36:48,767 --> 00:36:50,834
I finally have this chance
to write something

717
00:36:50,967 --> 00:36:54,100
that could get attention,
and I just--

718
00:36:54,233 --> 00:36:56,000
I can't get started.

719
00:36:59,934 --> 00:37:03,533
My editor told me to my face

720
00:37:03,667 --> 00:37:08,233
that I have a wall between
my head and my heart.

721
00:37:08,367 --> 00:37:10,333
And if I could just
break through it,

722
00:37:10,467 --> 00:37:12,800
then I could deliver
a cover-worthy story.

723
00:37:12,934 --> 00:37:14,567
- What?

724
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,834
You think I have a wall?

725
00:37:17,967 --> 00:37:20,066
I think
you're your father's daughter.

726
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,567
- See, I don't want that.

727
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,500
I don't want that,
I have to figure this out.

728
00:37:24,633 --> 00:37:27,467
- Okay, then what can I do
to help?

729
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,300
- Maybe I just need to reconnect
a little bit, you know?

730
00:37:30,433 --> 00:37:33,200
Just refresh my memory.

731
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:35,367
Get my hands dirty.

732
00:37:38,133 --> 00:37:39,867
- Or we could get
your hands clean.

733
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,667
- Oh, you like a bath,
don't you, Wally?

734
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,166
Yeah.

735
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,900
Aw.

736
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,433
So how do you do it?

737
00:38:02,567 --> 00:38:03,800
- How do I do what?

738
00:38:03,934 --> 00:38:06,233
- You know, that
horse whisperer thing you do.

739
00:38:09,533 --> 00:38:11,300
Well, horses
are not complicated.

740
00:38:11,433 --> 00:38:13,600
You, not so much.

741
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,100
Come on now, really?

742
00:38:20,233 --> 00:38:25,233
- No, with horses,
you just got to listen.

743
00:38:25,367 --> 00:38:27,734
More than just with your ears.

744
00:38:27,867 --> 00:38:29,800
You got to listen
with your hands.

745
00:38:29,934 --> 00:38:32,066
You see--here, give me this.

746
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,700
Now, get a feel for him.

747
00:38:35,834 --> 00:38:37,934
See how his leg feels.
Feel those ribs.

748
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:40,433
See how he moves
when he wants to talk to you.

749
00:38:40,567 --> 00:38:43,400
And then take a step back
and use your eyes.

750
00:38:43,533 --> 00:38:47,367
And you watch how he moves
and you see what he wants

751
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,600
and how he goes after it.

752
00:38:49,734 --> 00:38:52,266
And then--boom.

753
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,133
He has told you
everything he needs.

754
00:38:57,266 --> 00:39:02,133
- So why do
you think he's doing this?

755
00:39:02,266 --> 00:39:04,100
- Who, Preston?
- Yeah.

756
00:39:04,233 --> 00:39:05,433
I mean, you said yourself,

757
00:39:05,567 --> 00:39:06,967
most men his age
would have quit by now.

758
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,000
- Competitiveness
runs in your family.

759
00:39:09,133 --> 00:39:10,700
I mean, you should know that
more than anybody else.

760
00:39:10,834 --> 00:39:13,633
Because on--on a show day,
when you would be getting ready,

761
00:39:13,767 --> 00:39:16,533
ooh, you would get
that look in your eye.

762
00:39:16,667 --> 00:39:18,066
That one right there.

763
00:39:19,633 --> 00:39:21,333
And watch out.

764
00:39:21,467 --> 00:39:25,800
Every move, every jump,
just gotta be perfect.

765
00:39:25,934 --> 00:39:27,433
- All right, let's rinse him.

766
00:39:27,567 --> 00:39:29,567
Okay, let's rinse you.

767
00:39:33,467 --> 00:39:36,066
- Where'd you go just then?
- I was just thinking--

768
00:39:38,967 --> 00:39:41,200
- See?
He's telling us what he needs.

769
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:43,533
- You better--no!

770
00:39:43,667 --> 00:39:46,934
No! No! Ah!

771
00:39:47,066 --> 00:39:50,000
- Oh, real--

772
00:39:50,133 --> 00:39:53,400
- All right, I give,
I give, I give, I give!

773
00:39:56,934 --> 00:39:58,834
All right.

774
00:39:58,967 --> 00:40:01,433
we're almost there, I promise.
- Where are you taking me?

775
00:40:01,567 --> 00:40:03,033
- We're in Massachusetts now.

776
00:40:03,166 --> 00:40:05,333
Don't worry about it.

777
00:40:05,467 --> 00:40:08,000
- Just watch out for the cliff.
- Stop.

778
00:40:08,133 --> 00:40:09,667
- Okay, two more steps.

779
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,767
One, two.
- One, two.

780
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,467
- Voila.

781
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,867
Class is over.

782
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,734
This is
your graduation ceremony.

783
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,867
- You know
I don't ride anymore.

784
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,767
- No, I know you don't
compete anymore.

785
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,500
But this...

786
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:29,533
this is just for fun.

787
00:40:29,667 --> 00:40:32,433
And it's good for your soul.

788
00:40:34,567 --> 00:40:37,166
- And, uh, you know
what the best part is?

789
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,300
- Hi, buddy.
- You don't have to do it alone.

790
00:40:39,433 --> 00:40:41,667
- Hey, Rascal.

791
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,867
- Ready? Come on, Jake.

792
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,800
So, what do you say?

793
00:40:48,734 --> 00:40:50,967
Let's just ride.

794
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,100
All right.

795
00:40:58,233 --> 00:41:00,333
Okay.

796
00:41:00,467 --> 00:41:02,033
- How's it feel?

797
00:41:02,166 --> 00:41:04,567
- It feels...familiar.

798
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,500
- I'll tell you what.

799
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:08,900
Why don't we just take it easy?

800
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:11,200
Let you get used to it again.
How's that sound?

801
00:41:11,333 --> 00:41:14,700
- Yeah, sounds good.

802
00:41:17,333 --> 00:41:19,734
- There she goes.

803
00:41:19,867 --> 00:41:21,867
You wanna go get 'em?

804
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,834
Let's go.

805
00:41:37,367 --> 00:41:39,033
- Hey, Preston.

806
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:40,667
Preston!

807
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,700
You might want to come see this.

808
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:49,033
- Wow.
- Look at them.

809
00:41:49,166 --> 00:41:52,233
I'd hoped this would happen.
- Yeah.

810
00:42:09,834 --> 00:42:11,467
- Whew! That was fun.

811
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,166
- Yeah.

812
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,233
Almost forgot
how much I love this.

813
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:20,867
- You know, I was sad
when I hear you quit.

814
00:42:22,533 --> 00:42:23,867
Must've been a tough
decision for you,

815
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,567
and I thought about calling,

816
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,467
but I had just broken up
with you a month before...

817
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,800
- Mm-hmm.
- So that was out the window.

818
00:42:30,934 --> 00:42:32,500
- Yeah, fun times.

819
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,734
- But I'm ready to listen now.

820
00:42:38,867 --> 00:42:41,700
- I was competing upstate.

821
00:42:41,834 --> 00:42:43,400
Literally face down
in the dirt in front of

822
00:42:43,533 --> 00:42:45,500
some of the best equestrians
in the country.

823
00:42:45,633 --> 00:42:48,333
I get up,
I get back on Midnight.

824
00:42:48,467 --> 00:42:51,133
Dad calls me over.

825
00:42:51,266 --> 00:42:53,300
Barks, "Your head's
not in the game."

826
00:42:53,433 --> 00:42:55,900
- Well, I've heard that.
- Yeah.

827
00:42:56,033 --> 00:42:58,233
He was right.

828
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:02,400
Our marriage had just ended,
and I was heartbroken.

829
00:43:02,533 --> 00:43:05,300
And I was supposed
to focus on winning?

830
00:43:05,433 --> 00:43:07,967
The thing is, it wasn't just
him that expected perfection.

831
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,667
- It was everyone.
- Yeah.

832
00:43:14,066 --> 00:43:15,533
The business of winning
had become bigger

833
00:43:15,667 --> 00:43:17,066
than the love of the sport,
so I quit

834
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,533
and put my journalism degree
to work.

835
00:43:20,667 --> 00:43:22,200
- Sometimes we gotta
step away from something

836
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:26,033
to see how much we love it.
- Yeah.

837
00:43:26,166 --> 00:43:28,000
I think we really do.

838
00:43:31,533 --> 00:43:34,200
- Is it too late
to say I'm sorry?

839
00:43:34,333 --> 00:43:35,700
- Never.

840
00:43:35,834 --> 00:43:37,600
- I was just a trainer,

841
00:43:37,734 --> 00:43:41,967
married to the daughter
of such an established family.

842
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:45,867
It was, I don't know,
it was intimidating.

843
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,066
- Noted trainer.

844
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,266
- Not back then.

845
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,633
No, back then,
I was just starting out.

846
00:43:57,734 --> 00:44:01,667
You know, I had to work.
I had no safety net.

847
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,834
I didn't have the support
that you did.

848
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:07,934
You know, my parents
did the best they could.

849
00:44:08,066 --> 00:44:09,600
- And I'm sorry
for not telling you enough

850
00:44:09,734 --> 00:44:12,100
how great you were.

851
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:15,266
- No.
- Yeah, because you were.

852
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,633
Even then.

853
00:44:19,567 --> 00:44:21,800
I guess I wasn't the only one

854
00:44:21,934 --> 00:44:24,400
who had the pressure
of perfection, huh?

855
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,867
- Nope.

856
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,367
And then we just...

857
00:44:34,133 --> 00:44:37,200
We just grew apart faster
than we grew up.

858
00:44:43,633 --> 00:44:45,834
We should--

859
00:44:53,066 --> 00:44:56,000
I don't think
this is a good idea.

860
00:44:56,133 --> 00:44:58,467
- No.

861
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,700
Definitely not.

862
00:45:24,066 --> 00:45:27,066
I think we should head back.

863
00:45:28,667 --> 00:45:30,600
- Yeah, I think you're right.

864
00:45:41,333 --> 00:45:43,734
- Oh, where have you guys been?

865
00:45:43,867 --> 00:45:44,834
I've been looking for you.

866
00:45:44,967 --> 00:45:46,900
- Uh, why? What's going on?

867
00:45:47,033 --> 00:45:48,266
- Dad's hurt.

868
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,200
- Hurt?
- Come on.

869
00:45:53,633 --> 00:45:57,033
- I was just getting
Rascal some hay

870
00:45:57,166 --> 00:45:58,600
and I didn't expect
all the extra bales

871
00:45:58,734 --> 00:46:02,266
to come tumbling down on me.

872
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,600
- So just keep icing it.

873
00:46:06,266 --> 00:46:08,433
Keep it elevated.
- Got it.

874
00:46:08,567 --> 00:46:10,900
Thank you, Doc.
- You're welcome.

875
00:46:11,033 --> 00:46:12,633
It's great to see everybody.

876
00:46:12,767 --> 00:46:14,934
- Good to see you.
Thank you for coming.

877
00:46:16,934 --> 00:46:18,734
- This should go on the inside.

878
00:46:18,867 --> 00:46:20,967
- The doctor said the outside.

879
00:46:23,233 --> 00:46:26,800
- Thank you so much,
we really appreciate it.

880
00:46:26,934 --> 00:46:28,834
I mean, when my dad
sets his mind to something,

881
00:46:28,967 --> 00:46:30,400
there's nothing stopping him.

882
00:46:30,533 --> 00:46:32,967
- Well, it's just a sprain.
Your dad's a tough guy.

883
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,400
- Yeah.
- He just needs some rest.

884
00:46:35,533 --> 00:46:36,567
- Do you still think
he'll be able to compete

885
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,834
in the championships next week?

886
00:46:38,967 --> 00:46:41,767
- He conveniently neglected
to mention that small detail.

887
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,133
- Uh-huh.

888
00:46:45,266 --> 00:46:47,233
It's probably because he knows
you'll tell him, "No."

889
00:46:47,367 --> 00:46:48,633
- I've learned through the years

890
00:46:48,767 --> 00:46:50,600
that your dad's gonna do
what your dad's gonna do.

891
00:46:50,734 --> 00:46:53,834
But he needs
to stay off the horse.

892
00:46:53,967 --> 00:46:56,734
The thing is, Sam, your mom
and dad are getting older.

893
00:46:56,867 --> 00:46:58,433
Even with your sister here,

894
00:46:58,567 --> 00:47:01,066
this farm's a pretty big
responsibility.

895
00:47:03,367 --> 00:47:04,500
It's good to see you, Sam.

896
00:47:04,633 --> 00:47:06,200
- Yeah, it's good
to see you too.

897
00:47:06,333 --> 00:47:08,133
- Call me if you need anything.
- Thank you so much, Doctor.

898
00:47:08,266 --> 00:47:10,467
Dad, where you going?

899
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,667
- Work out Rascal.
I got a schedule.

900
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,867
- Well, don't you think
you need to rest?

901
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,500
- We got a competition coming
up, in case you haven't heard.

902
00:47:19,633 --> 00:47:20,967
- Doctor D said
you need to rest.

903
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:22,800
- Well, Doctor D is entitled
to his opinion.

904
00:47:22,934 --> 00:47:24,633
- Why are you doing this?

905
00:47:24,767 --> 00:47:25,967
- Doing what?
- This.

906
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:27,066
The--the competition.

907
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,367
You have a room
full of trophies.

908
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,066
Do you really need another one?

909
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,967
- I haven't won recently and

910
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,567
putting our family name
on a blue ribbon

911
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:38,300
would bring some
real value to this farm.

912
00:47:38,433 --> 00:47:39,400
- Value?

913
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,500
Wait--

914
00:47:43,633 --> 00:47:46,400
are you thinking
about selling this place?

915
00:47:46,533 --> 00:47:48,734
- I wasn't gonna
tell you or Alex

916
00:47:48,867 --> 00:47:51,633
until after we decided but...

917
00:47:51,767 --> 00:47:53,533
yes.

918
00:47:53,667 --> 00:47:57,367
Your mother and I
have talked about it.

919
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,066
We're gonna sell Meadowbrook.

920
00:48:01,867 --> 00:48:03,967
I'm sorry.

921
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,700
- Come on.

922
00:48:30,667 --> 00:48:33,967
- Stay up. No, stop worrying
about it.

923
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:38,500
Let your hands be easy.
- I can't get my balance.

924
00:48:38,633 --> 00:48:41,233
- Okay, then listen
to what I'm telling you.

925
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,333
It's just not gonna work.

926
00:48:54,467 --> 00:48:56,834
I'm leading with the wrong hand,
my balance is off.

927
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:58,300
- No, you're thinking
about it too much.

928
00:48:58,433 --> 00:49:01,200
Focus, stay centered.

929
00:49:01,333 --> 00:49:04,200
Okay, maybe your arm
will be ready by showtime.

930
00:49:04,333 --> 00:49:06,667
- "Maybe" is not gonna
get us a win.

931
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,233
If I want the best price
for this place,

932
00:49:09,367 --> 00:49:12,200
the Barclay name has gotta
end up in first place.

933
00:49:12,333 --> 00:49:14,000
- I know. Okay.

934
00:49:14,133 --> 00:49:15,934
- What about you, Luke?

935
00:49:16,066 --> 00:49:17,867
Do you think you could do it?

936
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,567
- No, no, no. Listen, Preston,

937
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:21,266
you know I would do anything
for Meadowbrook

938
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,567
but I am a trainer.
I am not a rider.

939
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,066
- I am.

940
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,266
- Samantha,
you don't have to do this.

941
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,567
- Dad, you've been
trying to get me

942
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:35,066
back on a horse for three years.

943
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,100
- Well, yeah, yeah, but I--
- I'm not gonna stand by

944
00:49:37,233 --> 00:49:40,400
and watch you get hurt
any more than you already are.

945
00:49:40,533 --> 00:49:43,333
- I do not know where you get
this stubborn streak from.

946
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,333
- Okay, listen.
- Yep.

947
00:49:50,467 --> 00:49:52,600
- First time around the course.
- Mm-hmm?

948
00:49:54,133 --> 00:49:56,000
- Take it easy.
- Mm-hmm.

949
00:49:56,133 --> 00:49:57,900
- Let Rascal get to know you,
okay?

950
00:49:58,033 --> 00:50:00,900
- Okay. Don't worry about us.

951
00:50:01,033 --> 00:50:04,100
Rascal and I are becoming
good buddies, aren't we?

952
00:50:04,233 --> 00:50:06,767
All right, ready?

953
00:50:08,166 --> 00:50:09,567
Hey, let's go.

954
00:50:12,834 --> 00:50:14,333
- I'm serious,
don't do anything crazy

955
00:50:14,467 --> 00:50:15,867
and do not try any jumps.

956
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,066
- I can't hear you.

957
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,700
- She's not gonna listen,
is she?

958
00:50:22,834 --> 00:50:24,233
- You're the one
who married her.

959
00:50:24,367 --> 00:50:25,700
What do you think?

960
00:50:27,633 --> 00:50:30,200
- Yeah, she's gonna jump.

961
00:50:30,333 --> 00:50:31,867
- Yeah, buddy.

962
00:50:34,233 --> 00:50:35,567
- There you go, Sam.

963
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:38,400
Nice and easy.

964
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,066
Easy, easy.

965
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,934
- That's it, Rascal,
show her the way.

966
00:50:49,333 --> 00:50:51,266
- She's riding again?

967
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,900
- Yes, yes, she is.

968
00:50:54,233 --> 00:50:56,033
- What do you say, Rascal?

969
00:50:56,166 --> 00:50:57,266
Let's do this.

970
00:51:04,934 --> 00:51:06,734
- Okay, what are you
doing, Sam?

971
00:51:06,867 --> 00:51:08,266
- She's not going to do
that jump, is she?

972
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,166
- Sam, do not do it.
- Never does what she's told.

973
00:51:13,367 --> 00:51:15,834
- Don't do it, Sam.
Don't do it, Sam.

974
00:51:17,767 --> 00:51:19,734
Sam!

975
00:51:19,867 --> 00:51:21,667
- Sam!

976
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,934
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
hey, hey, hey.

977
00:51:24,066 --> 00:51:25,667
I got you.
Hey, you okay?

978
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,633
I got you.
- Thank you.

979
00:51:28,767 --> 00:51:30,266
- Honey?
Honey, are you okay?

980
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,066
- Yes, I'm fine. I'm fine, Mom.

981
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,066
- This is why I told you
not to attempt that.

982
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,800
You are out of practice.
- Apparently.

983
00:51:36,934 --> 00:51:39,400
- Sam, really?
What were you thinking?

984
00:51:39,533 --> 00:51:41,433
- I was thinking
that I have less than a week

985
00:51:41,567 --> 00:51:43,400
to get ready
for the championships, Dad.

986
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:47,266
And I can't do this without you.

987
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,934
What do you say?

988
00:51:49,066 --> 00:51:51,100
Wanna train me?

989
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:53,467
- Well, that depends.

990
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,100
Are you gonna listen to me?

991
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:00,867
- I'm sorry, come again?

992
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,333
Did you say
you're competing in the event?

993
00:52:04,467 --> 00:52:05,700
- I did.

994
00:52:05,834 --> 00:52:07,300
- But I thought
you gave up riding.

995
00:52:07,433 --> 00:52:08,633
- I did.

996
00:52:08,767 --> 00:52:10,367
I guess sometimes
you have to step away

997
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,834
from something to realize
how much you love it.

998
00:52:12,967 --> 00:52:16,200
- And now you think
you found it again?

999
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:18,333
- I think maybe I have.

1000
00:52:18,467 --> 00:52:23,166
Well, I did tell you to put
yourself into the article.

1001
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:25,834
And now you are actually
riding the horse.

1002
00:52:25,967 --> 00:52:28,367
Wow, you really know
how to take a note.

1003
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,967
All right, keep working at it.

1004
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:32,834
Send me updates.

1005
00:52:32,967 --> 00:52:34,900
- Will do, thank you.

1006
00:52:35,033 --> 00:52:37,667
- I don't need thank you's.
Just write me a good article.

1007
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,667
Oh, and make sure
to get great photos.

1008
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,967
- Okay.

1009
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,133
We're going back
to basics now, okay?

1010
00:52:51,266 --> 00:52:52,433
- Yeah.

1011
00:52:53,967 --> 00:52:56,533
- Heels down.

1012
00:52:56,667 --> 00:52:58,900
Keep straight.
- Mm-hmm.

1013
00:52:59,033 --> 00:53:02,066
- And listen,
you can take it...

1014
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,900
a little bit more.

1015
00:53:04,033 --> 00:53:05,767
Not too much.

1016
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:08,100
He'll feel you.

1017
00:53:08,233 --> 00:53:10,133
Just trust him.

1018
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,400
- They say once you
fall off a horse,

1019
00:53:17,533 --> 00:53:19,567
you have to get right back on.

1020
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:20,967
Let me assure you,

1021
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:24,500
this is not
as easy as it sounds.

1022
00:53:28,166 --> 00:53:30,233
- You gotta
get out of your head.

1023
00:53:30,367 --> 00:53:34,100
You got to start to feel
this is a partnership.

1024
00:53:37,066 --> 00:53:39,900
- The Northeastern Championships
are one of the most elite

1025
00:53:40,033 --> 00:53:42,567
and anticipated
horse events in the country,

1026
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:45,900
and they're happening
in my backyard.

1027
00:53:46,767 --> 00:53:48,967
And now,
it's up to me to win it,

1028
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,133
with my grumbling father,

1029
00:53:51,266 --> 00:53:54,767
my ex-husband-turned-
personal-horse-trainer,

1030
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:57,266
and a horse that lives up
to his name, Rascal,

1031
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,300
all by my side.

1032
00:54:00,433 --> 00:54:02,667
- Do it again.

1033
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,533
- Now, being trained
by your ex-husband

1034
00:54:05,667 --> 00:54:09,600
is...complicated.

1035
00:54:09,734 --> 00:54:12,333
It takes a whole lot of courage

1036
00:54:12,467 --> 00:54:17,500
and an incredible amount
of patience and trust.

1037
00:54:17,633 --> 00:54:19,934
- You have to be clean
if you want to qualify.

1038
00:54:20,066 --> 00:54:21,700
- Little more, about six inches.

1039
00:54:21,834 --> 00:54:24,300
- My mother and sister
have designed and delivered

1040
00:54:24,433 --> 00:54:26,834
a beautiful event.

1041
00:54:26,967 --> 00:54:30,000
Now it's up to me to win it.

1042
00:54:31,133 --> 00:54:34,033
The thing is,
no one can do this for me.

1043
00:54:34,166 --> 00:54:35,333
You can have the best trainer
in the state,

1044
00:54:35,467 --> 00:54:37,166
the most athletic of horses,

1045
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:38,834
and a sideline of loved ones
cheering you on.

1046
00:54:38,967 --> 00:54:41,967
- That was nice.

1047
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:43,867
- But at the end of the day,

1048
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,533
it's up to me to make that jump.

1049
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:59,166
So how do you actually
get back on a horse?

1050
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:01,100
You just do.

1051
00:55:17,934 --> 00:55:19,967
- Hi.
- Hi.

1052
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:22,400
- Hi.

1053
00:55:22,533 --> 00:55:23,600
Um, your mom ordered these.

1054
00:55:23,734 --> 00:55:25,166
I told her
I would drop them off.

1055
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:27,400
- Oh, thank you.

1056
00:55:27,533 --> 00:55:30,900
Thank you.
- Can I give them to you?

1057
00:55:31,033 --> 00:55:33,066
Ah, Sam, about the other night--

1058
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,834
- Don't worry about it.

1059
00:55:35,967 --> 00:55:39,600
- Oh, well, I have been.
All week.

1060
00:55:39,734 --> 00:55:41,300
I should have at least
said hi or something.

1061
00:55:41,433 --> 00:55:45,600
It was just so awkward.

1062
00:55:45,734 --> 00:55:48,967
- But honestly, it's okay.
- Okay.

1063
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:51,734
Well, the truth is, um,

1064
00:55:51,867 --> 00:55:53,066
I have been on
a few dates with Luke.

1065
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,266
But it hasn't really worked out.

1066
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,133
He mostly just talks
about you, really.

1067
00:56:00,266 --> 00:56:03,133
- I, um, I'm so sorry
about that, I--

1068
00:56:03,266 --> 00:56:05,533
- Don't be.

1069
00:56:05,667 --> 00:56:06,900
Everybody knows that Travers

1070
00:56:07,033 --> 00:56:10,667
is still in love with you.

1071
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:14,834
Everybody except you,
apparently.

1072
00:56:17,967 --> 00:56:20,633
Okay, I should get back
to the bakery.

1073
00:56:20,767 --> 00:56:23,867
It's a--it's a one-woman band
over there.

1074
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,633
Enjoy. Say hi to your mom.

1075
00:56:25,767 --> 00:56:28,633
- Hey, Ashley,
do you remember the article

1076
00:56:28,767 --> 00:56:30,367
I told you I was writing
for the magazine?

1077
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,400
- Oh, yeah, of course.

1078
00:56:32,533 --> 00:56:35,200
- I would love to talk to you
about your photographs.

1079
00:57:04,066 --> 00:57:06,467
- The banquet tent is up.

1080
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:10,800
I just don't know if the
centerpieces are big enough.

1081
00:57:10,934 --> 00:57:13,133
- I'm sure they'll be fine.

1082
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:22,100
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I've been thinking.

1083
00:57:22,233 --> 00:57:24,600
Samantha is doing
such a good job out there.

1084
00:57:24,734 --> 00:57:26,767
It's like she never quit.

1085
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:29,767
I'm just so proud of her.

1086
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,633
- Have you told her that?

1087
00:57:31,767 --> 00:57:33,867
- Ah, she doesn't want
to hear it from me.

1088
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,467
- That is where you are wrong.

1089
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:39,500
You're exactly the one
she needs to hear it from.

1090
00:57:42,233 --> 00:57:43,400
- Hm.

1091
00:57:43,533 --> 00:57:47,133
- She's doing
all of this for you.

1092
00:57:47,266 --> 00:57:49,967
You old bear.

1093
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:51,767
- The least you can do

1094
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:53,734
is tell her
that you appreciate it.

1095
00:57:53,867 --> 00:57:55,900
- She knows that.

1096
00:57:56,033 --> 00:57:59,367
Why does everybody have to
talk about everything?

1097
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:02,033
- Don't make
the same mistake again.

1098
00:58:02,166 --> 00:58:04,633
Let your daughter
know how you feel.

1099
00:58:04,767 --> 00:58:06,467
- How?

1100
00:58:08,667 --> 00:58:10,867
- That's up to you.

1101
00:58:12,133 --> 00:58:15,000
Old bear.

1102
00:58:36,633 --> 00:58:37,967
- You're still out here, huh?

1103
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:39,934
- Almost finished.

1104
00:58:40,066 --> 00:58:42,767
It's a lot of paperwork.

1105
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:44,367
- Alex.

1106
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:47,467
Alexandra.

1107
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,433
- Yes?
- I wanted to tell you that

1108
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:51,266
your being here,

1109
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,834
your taking care
of all this stuff, it--

1110
00:58:53,967 --> 00:58:55,633
it means a lot.

1111
00:58:55,767 --> 00:58:58,467
It means a lot to me.

1112
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:01,767
- Well, thanks, Dad.

1113
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:08,266
- I have to get
inside and help your mother.

1114
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,133
- Mm-hmm.
- Night.

1115
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:54,200
- That was such a great shot.

1116
01:00:02,734 --> 01:00:04,266
- Are you getting
some fun things?

1117
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,166
- I'm getting everything.

1118
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:07,867
I'm having the time of my life.

1119
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,667
Thank you for having me here.

1120
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,266
It really means a lot to me.
- Me too.

1121
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,000
I'm so happy you're here.

1122
01:00:13,133 --> 01:00:15,000
- I'm so happy too.

1123
01:00:15,133 --> 01:00:15,934
Go, I'll get pictures
of everything.

1124
01:00:16,066 --> 01:00:18,667
Have fun.
- Thanks.

1125
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:20,433
Hey.

1126
01:00:21,834 --> 01:00:24,266
- Why won't he just ask me out?

1127
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,700
- If you like him so much,
why don't you just ask him out?

1128
01:00:27,834 --> 01:00:29,400
- Well, I don't know
if I like him enough

1129
01:00:29,533 --> 01:00:31,200
for me to ask him out.

1130
01:00:31,333 --> 01:00:33,600
- Well, sister, I don't know
what to tell you, okay?

1131
01:00:33,734 --> 01:00:35,367
Are you either in or--
- Those are supposed to be

1132
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:39,633
amuse bouche--hang on.

1133
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:43,567
- Amanda.

1134
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:45,900
- Well, hello.
- Hello!

1135
01:00:46,033 --> 01:00:48,400
What are you doing here?
You look amazing.

1136
01:00:48,533 --> 01:00:49,667
- Thank you, so do you.

1137
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:50,734
Well, when I read
your email updates,

1138
01:00:50,867 --> 01:00:51,867
I couldn't resist.

1139
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,033
So I commandeered
the company car

1140
01:00:53,166 --> 01:00:55,734
and here I am.
I live for this.

1141
01:00:55,867 --> 01:00:58,533
If you capture even half
of this event in your article,

1142
01:00:58,667 --> 01:01:00,900
it will make me look very good.

1143
01:01:01,033 --> 01:01:02,734
And I really like to look good.

1144
01:01:02,867 --> 01:01:06,266
- Yeah, well, I just want to
deliver a great article for you.

1145
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,533
- You got this.
- Thank you.

1146
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:13,333
- Vigo, Amanda Carter,
"Compass" magazine.

1147
01:01:21,567 --> 01:01:23,166
- Hey.

1148
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:26,967
- Wow. Look at you.

1149
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,967
- You spent pretty much
our entire marriage

1150
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:31,233
trying to get me to dress up,
so I figured today

1151
01:01:31,367 --> 01:01:34,967
I would dress up for you.

1152
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:36,934
- Well, you look very dapper.

1153
01:01:39,867 --> 01:01:41,266
Yeah!

1154
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,000
- Feels good, feels right.
- Yeah.

1155
01:01:43,133 --> 01:01:44,834
- Hello, everyone.

1156
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:47,567
Welcome to
the Northeastern Championships.

1157
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:52,967
This is our first year
to host this event,

1158
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:55,567
and we are thrilled
that you are here.

1159
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:57,400
- First, I have to say
that none of this

1160
01:01:57,533 --> 01:02:01,333
would have been possible
without my wife

1161
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:05,500
and my extraordinary daughter,
Alexandra.

1162
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,033
- Whoo!
Yeah!

1163
01:02:09,166 --> 01:02:11,533
- Now, as many of you know,
or you can see here,

1164
01:02:11,667 --> 01:02:14,367
I'm not able to compete
in tomorrow's event.

1165
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:17,333
So Meadowbrook Stables
is going to be represented

1166
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:21,667
by somebody I care about
and also love dearly,

1167
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:24,266
our eldest daughter, Samantha.

1168
01:02:27,667 --> 01:02:29,467
As many of you know,

1169
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:31,567
Sam left the horse world
several years ago

1170
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:34,066
to pursue other interests.

1171
01:02:35,767 --> 01:02:38,300
So we're--we're very glad
that she stepped in

1172
01:02:38,433 --> 01:02:41,166
and we're happy
to have her home.

1173
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:44,900
- Well, please, eat, drink
and have a wonderful time.

1174
01:02:45,033 --> 01:02:46,200
Enjoy yourselves.

1175
01:02:46,333 --> 01:02:47,700
- Today is all about pleasure.

1176
01:02:47,834 --> 01:02:50,233
Tomorrow is about winning.

1177
01:03:07,066 --> 01:03:08,767
- Excuse me.

1178
01:03:11,033 --> 01:03:14,233
Five, six.

1179
01:03:32,734 --> 01:03:34,934
- How you feeling?

1180
01:03:35,066 --> 01:03:37,633
- I never thought
I would be back here.

1181
01:03:37,767 --> 01:03:39,734
- But you're pretty lucky.

1182
01:03:39,867 --> 01:03:42,900
'Cause not everybody
gets a second chance.

1183
01:03:43,033 --> 01:03:44,767
- That's true.

1184
01:03:57,734 --> 01:03:59,533
Are you still in love with me?

1185
01:03:59,667 --> 01:04:02,834
- Yes.
Are you still in love with me?

1186
01:04:02,967 --> 01:04:05,533
- It was never
a question of love, Luke.

1187
01:04:05,667 --> 01:04:07,800
It--it wasn't, it was
a question of everything else

1188
01:04:07,934 --> 01:04:10,166
but never love.

1189
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:12,767
- There she is.
- What's so funny?

1190
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:14,800
- Nothing, nothing.
I just know you too well.

1191
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:18,166
- Oh, you do, huh?
- Yeah. I do.

1192
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:20,467
Like what's going on inside
that head of yours right now

1193
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:22,934
is--is--is
you are writing a novel

1194
01:04:23,066 --> 01:04:26,533
about all of the things that
could possibly go wrong here.

1195
01:04:26,667 --> 01:04:29,200
You--you have spreadsheets
and--and checklists

1196
01:04:29,333 --> 01:04:31,867
of every disaster that could
possibly happen here.

1197
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,367
"Are we together? Are we not?

1198
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:34,633
Should we do this? Should we
stop while we're ahead?"

1199
01:04:34,767 --> 01:04:37,467
- Yes!
- And I just--I just--

1200
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:40,967
I don't want to repeat history
either, I really don't, but I--

1201
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:45,033
I just want you to stop
thinking for a second.

1202
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:49,934
Because right now,

1203
01:04:50,066 --> 01:04:53,200
the only thing I can think about

1204
01:04:53,333 --> 01:04:55,500
is how much I want to kiss you.

1205
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:14,967
- Good afternoon and welcome

1206
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:17,166
to the Northeastern
Equestrian Championships.

1207
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:20,633
The best riders in the country
are here in Meadowbrook Farms

1208
01:05:20,767 --> 01:05:22,900
to compete for the blue ribbon.

1209
01:05:23,033 --> 01:05:25,667
The competition is
unbelievably stiff this year.

1210
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,133
All the competitors here
are good enough to win

1211
01:05:28,266 --> 01:05:29,934
but it will take a special rider

1212
01:05:30,066 --> 01:05:32,600
to get a clean run
on this course.

1213
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:08,734
The excitement of completion day
can be felt throughout the crowd

1214
01:06:08,867 --> 01:06:11,100
as our riders get ready
for their first round.

1215
01:06:19,433 --> 01:06:22,333
This is Meadowbrook's
first year hosting the event,

1216
01:06:22,467 --> 01:06:24,667
but the Barclay name
is no stranger

1217
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:27,467
to the show jumping world.

1218
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:28,867
- Good job.

1219
01:06:35,834 --> 01:06:38,467
- Please take your seats
as we welcome the judges

1220
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:39,800
and the competitors.

1221
01:06:51,033 --> 01:06:53,567
Our reigning champ,
Charlotte Anderson,

1222
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:57,166
riding Hunter
is really the one to watch here.

1223
01:07:05,433 --> 01:07:07,800
Samantha Barclay riding Rascal

1224
01:07:07,934 --> 01:07:10,567
is stepping in for her father
after an injury.

1225
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:13,433
Samantha is a well-known
championship rider,

1226
01:07:13,567 --> 01:07:16,133
known for her consistency
and composure.

1227
01:07:20,166 --> 01:07:24,400
Each rider will have 55 seconds
to complete the first round

1228
01:07:24,533 --> 01:07:27,467
and only the top scorers
will be able to continue

1229
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:30,567
to round two
for a chance at the ribbon.

1230
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,400
Another beautiful jump
from Charlotte,

1231
01:07:35,533 --> 01:07:38,133
who seems to be
on her game today.

1232
01:07:38,266 --> 01:07:40,266
Oh, I spoke too soon.

1233
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,734
That's her first bad jump.

1234
01:07:42,867 --> 01:07:46,467
She follows up that mistake
with a good recovery jump.

1235
01:07:50,767 --> 01:07:52,433
Two more perfect jumps

1236
01:07:52,567 --> 01:07:55,767
as she finishes her first round
with only one fault.

1237
01:08:01,567 --> 01:08:05,166
A fan favorite, Rusty,
starts out with a strong run.

1238
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:08,867
He is an incredibly
strong and fast horse.

1239
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,700
Rusty lands badly.

1240
01:08:10,834 --> 01:08:13,834
That'll cost him some points.

1241
01:08:16,233 --> 01:08:18,200
He does have trouble
with his turns,

1242
01:08:18,333 --> 01:08:22,367
sometimes not giving himself
enough space for the lead-up.

1243
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:26,000
And oh, a run-out for Rusty.

1244
01:08:28,166 --> 01:08:29,934
Unfortunately, it looks like

1245
01:08:30,066 --> 01:08:33,367
that will disqualify him
for round two.

1246
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:35,433
Our next rider,
Samantha Barclay

1247
01:08:35,567 --> 01:08:37,700
from our host stables
here at Meadowbrook.

1248
01:08:37,834 --> 01:08:39,233
She's riding Rascal.

1249
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,533
In order to continue
to the next round,

1250
01:08:45,667 --> 01:08:50,033
Samantha and Rascal will need
to have under four faults.

1251
01:08:57,667 --> 01:08:59,900
Oh, and there they go.

1252
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,233
Beautiful first jump.
- Oh!

1253
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:13,200
- One vertical down,

1254
01:09:13,333 --> 01:09:16,266
which is okay, as long
as she doesn't get in her head.

1255
01:09:24,734 --> 01:09:28,300
Lovely turn and another
clean jump for Rascal.

1256
01:09:29,367 --> 01:09:31,200
Not a great run
for Samantha and Rascal

1257
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:32,600
but it looks like
it'll be good enough

1258
01:09:32,734 --> 01:09:34,567
to make it to round two.

1259
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:37,934
But she certainly will have
her work cut out for her.

1260
01:09:44,967 --> 01:09:46,033
- It's just one fault.

1261
01:09:46,166 --> 01:09:47,533
She can make it up
in the next round.

1262
01:09:47,667 --> 01:09:49,700
- Absolutely, she's fine.
- Right.

1263
01:09:49,834 --> 01:09:51,400
- Whoa, whoa.

1264
01:10:00,233 --> 01:10:01,900
Buddy, it's not you, okay?

1265
01:10:02,033 --> 01:10:04,767
It's me, it's me.

1266
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:07,033
All right, let's go.

1267
01:10:07,166 --> 01:10:08,934
Come on.

1268
01:10:09,066 --> 01:10:10,934
- All right,
we're gonna take a short break,

1269
01:10:11,066 --> 01:10:14,066
and we'll be back with
our final event of the day.

1270
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:17,700
- Thanks, Matthew.

1271
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:29,333
- Sam.

1272
01:10:29,467 --> 01:10:31,767
Samantha.

1273
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:34,667
- Dad, I am so sorry.
I--

1274
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:36,934
I want to win this for you.
I--I just--

1275
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:39,033
I feel like
I'm letting you down.

1276
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,834
- I think for someone
who's been away for so long,

1277
01:10:41,967 --> 01:10:43,600
you're doing
just fine out there.

1278
01:10:45,567 --> 01:10:47,667
- I know you want me
to be this great equestrian,

1279
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:52,967
and I feel like I'm just writing
stories about it in a magazine.

1280
01:10:56,066 --> 01:10:58,166
- Come with me.

1281
01:10:58,300 --> 01:10:59,934
Come on.

1282
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:10,967
I want to show you something.

1283
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,000
- Dad, when did you
start smoking?

1284
01:11:13,133 --> 01:11:14,633
- I don't smoke.

1285
01:11:14,767 --> 01:11:16,600
Just open it.

1286
01:11:20,633 --> 01:11:23,333
- It's my--my articles.

1287
01:11:23,467 --> 01:11:25,400
- Yeah, I got stories in there

1288
01:11:25,533 --> 01:11:26,967
from your student newspaper,

1289
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:29,600
that magazine you used
to write for locally,

1290
01:11:29,734 --> 01:11:31,300
even got the first--

1291
01:11:31,433 --> 01:11:34,567
first one you got published
when you moved to New York.

1292
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:37,600
- This is everything
I've ever written.

1293
01:11:37,734 --> 01:11:40,767
You even have my paragraph
on personalized dinnerware.

1294
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:42,600
- There's one about macrame
in there too.

1295
01:11:42,734 --> 01:11:45,467
Which, do not tell your mother,
I enjoyed.

1296
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:52,000
- I can't believe
you saved all of this.

1297
01:11:52,133 --> 01:11:54,767
- You wrote it, I read it.

1298
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,367
- Why didn't you
ever say anything? I--

1299
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:05,667
All these years, I just--

1300
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:08,367
I thought you were
disappointed in me.

1301
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:10,567
- Disappointed?

1302
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:14,233
Sam, I could never be
disappointed in you.

1303
01:12:14,367 --> 01:12:17,800
Sad, maybe, but not--

1304
01:12:17,934 --> 01:12:21,100
not because
you gave up the sport.

1305
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:26,834
Because maybe I felt like
that you gave me up.

1306
01:12:31,433 --> 01:12:34,166
All those years of training,

1307
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:36,200
driving across
the country to competitions,

1308
01:12:36,333 --> 01:12:38,533
they're the best years
of my life.

1309
01:12:40,533 --> 01:12:42,734
Do I like to win?
Yeah, of course.

1310
01:12:42,867 --> 01:12:45,633
But spending
all that time with you

1311
01:12:45,767 --> 01:12:49,633
is what I cared about most.

1312
01:12:52,834 --> 01:12:55,333
Dad those were--

1313
01:12:55,467 --> 01:12:58,000
those were some of
the best years of my life too.

1314
01:12:59,967 --> 01:13:03,066
I just needed time to--
to find my way,

1315
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:06,767
but...you were never gonna
lose me.

1316
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:09,133
Ever.

1317
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:16,433
- I know I don't say
this enough, Sam.

1318
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:20,500
At--at--at all, really.

1319
01:13:22,834 --> 01:13:25,467
I'm so proud of you.

1320
01:13:26,166 --> 01:13:29,700
I always have been,
always will be.

1321
01:13:29,834 --> 01:13:31,066
You're following your heart

1322
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:33,700
and you're doing
what makes you happy.

1323
01:13:33,834 --> 01:13:35,834
That's all a parent
could ever ask for.

1324
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:42,567
I love you.

1325
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:49,100
- I love you so much.

1326
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:54,867
- All right. Now, it's time.

1327
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:59,200
- I'm afraid I'm not doing
a very good job for Meadowbrook.

1328
01:13:59,333 --> 01:14:01,467
- I want you to forget
about the competition.

1329
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:04,433
I want you
to forget about winning.

1330
01:14:04,567 --> 01:14:07,934
- I--I'm sorry, what?
- That--that's right.

1331
01:14:08,066 --> 01:14:11,633
I want you to forget everything
I ever told you about winning.

1332
01:14:12,467 --> 01:14:14,100
I want you to remember
why you loved the sport

1333
01:14:14,233 --> 01:14:16,367
in the first place.

1334
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:19,867
I want you to get out there,
I want you to ride Rascal,

1335
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,233
and to have some fun.

1336
01:14:30,467 --> 01:14:31,367
- Ann

1337
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:32,867
for Charlotte and Hunter.

1338
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,567
With only a one-fault total,

1339
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:37,600
it will keep her in first place.

1340
01:14:37,734 --> 01:14:41,500
- Yep, up. All right.

1341
01:14:41,633 --> 01:14:42,834
Here we go.

1342
01:14:42,967 --> 01:14:44,734
Thanks, Matthew. All right.

1343
01:14:48,834 --> 01:14:51,000
Let's just have some fun,
buddy, okay?

1344
01:14:51,133 --> 01:14:52,033
Okay.

1345
01:14:55,533 --> 01:14:57,333
- And our final competitor
for the event,

1346
01:14:57,467 --> 01:14:59,800
Samantha Barclay and Rascal.

1347
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:04,400
They had some trouble
in the first round,

1348
01:15:04,533 --> 01:15:09,400
so they will need a completely
clean ride to land in first.

1349
01:15:09,533 --> 01:15:12,667
Whoa, off to a strong start.

1350
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:15,500
Great pace.

1351
01:15:15,633 --> 01:15:17,567
Beautiful leaps.

1352
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:19,233
- Whoa!

1353
01:15:19,367 --> 01:15:21,600
- She needs to stay in it
as she approaches

1354
01:15:21,734 --> 01:15:22,967
the trouble jump.

1355
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:28,300
The turn looks tight.

1356
01:15:28,433 --> 01:15:30,400
Perfect speed.

1357
01:15:30,533 --> 01:15:32,300
And clear.
- Yes.

1358
01:15:43,934 --> 01:15:48,100
- Whoo!
- She did it!

1359
01:15:48,233 --> 01:15:51,967
- Wow, what a run
for Samantha and Rascal.

1360
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:55,734
And that is what
we call a winning ride.

1361
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:03,734
- She's a star.

1362
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:06,600
Whoo!

1363
01:16:10,633 --> 01:16:13,800
- Congratulations.
- Oh, thank you.

1364
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:18,266
- Good job, buddy. Good job.

1365
01:16:20,266 --> 01:16:22,033
- Okay, everyone, big smiles.
- All righty.

1366
01:16:22,166 --> 01:16:24,567
- Eyes up here.
Everyone say, "Rascal."

1367
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:25,900
all: Rascal.

1368
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:32,133
- I just love the look
on Sam's face here.

1369
01:16:32,266 --> 01:16:34,500
So determined.
- These are exquisite.

1370
01:16:34,633 --> 01:16:35,900
You have real talent.

1371
01:16:36,033 --> 01:16:37,333
- Oh, I don't know
about all that.

1372
01:16:37,467 --> 01:16:39,967
I'm just taking pictures.
- I would. It's my job.

1373
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:43,166
Editor-in-chief, Amanda Carter.
"Compass" magazine.

1374
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:44,700
- Wow.

1375
01:16:44,834 --> 01:16:47,700
- We need to talk.
- We do?

1376
01:16:47,834 --> 01:16:49,900
Okay.

1377
01:16:50,033 --> 01:16:53,400
- Oh, hey. Hey, um,

1378
01:16:53,533 --> 01:16:55,567
there's someone
I'd really like you to meet.

1379
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:58,567
- Who?
- This is Jared.

1380
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:01,033
My boyfriend.

1381
01:17:01,166 --> 01:17:02,967
- Boyfriend.

1382
01:17:04,567 --> 01:17:06,066
It's nice to meet you, Jared.

1383
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:08,033
- Nice to meet you too.
- Jared, this is Alex.

1384
01:17:08,166 --> 01:17:10,233
Alex runs the books around here.

1385
01:17:10,367 --> 01:17:11,734
Actually, she runs
everything around here.

1386
01:17:11,867 --> 01:17:14,433
She does an incredible job
at it all.

1387
01:17:14,567 --> 01:17:16,967
- Thank you for saying so.

1388
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:18,400
- Oh, I love this song.

1389
01:17:18,533 --> 01:17:20,233
Come on, let's go dance.

1390
01:17:20,367 --> 01:17:22,767
Bye.
- Bye.

1391
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:29,900
- Mmm, this is good.
- Yeah?

1392
01:17:30,033 --> 01:17:31,266
- Have you tried it?
- No.

1393
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:32,934
But I picked most of it out.

1394
01:17:33,066 --> 01:17:34,734
- Oh, then
you've got great taste.

1395
01:17:34,867 --> 01:17:37,300
- Thanks.

1396
01:17:37,433 --> 01:17:40,633
- I'm Scott.
- I'm Alexandra.

1397
01:17:40,767 --> 01:17:42,367
Do you want to dance?

1398
01:17:50,734 --> 01:17:52,066
- You know what?
- Thank you, thank you.

1399
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:54,100
- It was all her,
it was all her.

1400
01:17:54,233 --> 01:17:57,667
- Good training, good job.
- Thank you so much.

1401
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:59,433
- Well, that's gotta feel good.

1402
01:17:59,567 --> 01:18:01,166
- I didn't do it for the win.

1403
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:05,033
But yeah, it feels kinda good.
- Yeah.

1404
01:18:05,166 --> 01:18:07,633
- I did it to make

1405
01:18:07,767 --> 01:18:10,967
my parents happy.
- And that you did.

1406
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:12,667
You knocked it out of the park.

1407
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,200
- You were terrific, sweetie.

1408
01:18:14,333 --> 01:18:16,533
Terrific.
- Thank you.

1409
01:18:16,667 --> 01:18:20,567
- Your mother and I would like
to run something by you.

1410
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:24,000
We've spoken to Alex,
and she's onboard.

1411
01:18:24,133 --> 01:18:27,000
We have decided not to sell.

1412
01:18:29,767 --> 01:18:31,734
Oh, Dad, I am--

1413
01:18:31,867 --> 01:18:34,300
I'm really relieved.

1414
01:18:34,433 --> 01:18:37,500
I know how much work
this place is to keep up with,

1415
01:18:37,633 --> 01:18:40,467
but I just--I couldn't
bear letting it go.

1416
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:42,333
- I still want to step back
from the business a bit.

1417
01:18:42,467 --> 01:18:45,567
- Well, we're taking
a vacation actually.

1418
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:47,500
We need a little bit
of much needed us time.

1419
01:18:47,633 --> 01:18:49,700
- That's fantastic.
Where are you going?

1420
01:18:49,834 --> 01:18:50,867
- France.
- Mexico.

1421
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,700
- Who's gonna watch
the stables?

1422
01:18:52,834 --> 01:18:56,834
- Your dad has promoted
your sister to general manager.

1423
01:18:56,967 --> 01:19:00,800
- Alex! Come here.

1424
01:19:00,934 --> 01:19:03,066
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1425
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:06,066
- If this is what you want?
- It is, it is.

1426
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:07,967
The more I thought about it,
the more I realized

1427
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:09,734
how much I love this place.

1428
01:19:09,867 --> 01:19:12,400
And I'm gonna get a raise.
And a new car.

1429
01:19:12,533 --> 01:19:15,400
- Huh?
- Mm-hmm.

1430
01:19:15,533 --> 01:19:16,600
It's a win-win.

1431
01:19:16,734 --> 01:19:18,567
Now if you'll excuse me,

1432
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:20,333
I have to go see
a man about a dance.

1433
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:25,600
- Obviously, Alex can't
run the place alone.

1434
01:19:25,734 --> 01:19:27,266
It's a two-person job.

1435
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:31,200
So we need somebody who knows
the horses and how we work.

1436
01:19:31,333 --> 01:19:33,900
- Dad, I--

1437
01:19:34,033 --> 01:19:36,400
this has been so much fun,
and I'm so grateful

1438
01:19:36,533 --> 01:19:39,233
that you got me back on a horse
but I love my job.

1439
01:19:39,367 --> 01:19:40,834
- Not you.

1440
01:19:43,567 --> 01:19:45,100
- We can work out
the details later,

1441
01:19:45,233 --> 01:19:51,567
But we would like to offer you
the job permanently.

1442
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:55,233
- Wow. First of all, thank you.

1443
01:19:55,367 --> 01:19:58,934
I mean, that means
the world to me. It does.

1444
01:19:59,066 --> 01:20:02,767
I--I just don't think
I could take that position

1445
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:05,266
without Sam's blessing.

1446
01:20:08,166 --> 01:20:10,600
- I can't think of anyone
better for this job.

1447
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:15,567
- Okay.

1448
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:17,300
Well, I am honored,
and I promise you

1449
01:20:17,433 --> 01:20:18,400
I will take good care
of the place.

1450
01:20:18,533 --> 01:20:19,633
- Oh, you better take care

1451
01:20:19,767 --> 01:20:22,800
of more than just this place.
- Dad!

1452
01:20:22,934 --> 01:20:25,800
- Just covering my bases.
- Okay, honey,

1453
01:20:25,934 --> 01:20:27,533
why don't we go dance?
- Oh, now?

1454
01:20:27,667 --> 01:20:28,734
- Yeah, mm-hmm.

1455
01:20:28,867 --> 01:20:32,133
Come on, you old bear.

1456
01:20:36,166 --> 01:20:37,266
Wow!

1457
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:41,033
- Okay, well--
- Look at you.

1458
01:20:41,166 --> 01:20:42,266
- How about you?

1459
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:45,533
Are you gonna ask me to dance?

1460
01:20:45,667 --> 01:20:47,767
- Luke Travers,

1461
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:50,233
would you like to dance?

1462
01:20:50,367 --> 01:20:53,300
- I thought you would never ask.

1463
01:20:53,433 --> 01:20:54,700
- Come on.

1464
01:21:10,333 --> 01:21:12,200
- You pleased with yourself?

1465
01:21:12,333 --> 01:21:16,700
- Sometimes people just need
a nudge in the right direction.

1466
01:21:16,834 --> 01:21:19,700
Do you think she knows?

1467
01:21:19,834 --> 01:21:24,033
- Well, knowing our daughter,

1468
01:21:24,166 --> 01:21:25,700
yes.

1469
01:21:27,133 --> 01:21:29,633
- Do you think she cares?

1470
01:21:29,767 --> 01:21:32,166
- I think she's happy.

1471
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:36,066
And that's all that matters.
- That's true.

1472
01:21:37,934 --> 01:21:39,266
France.
- Mexico.

1473
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:44,867
- You don't think
they were trying

1474
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,667
to get us back together,
do you?

1475
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:49,200
- Would it be that bad?

1476
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:54,300
- Good thing you kept Winston.

1477
01:22:12,133 --> 01:22:13,400
It's out!

1478
01:22:13,533 --> 01:22:15,066
- Already got mine.

1479
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:18,433
But I want you
to sign it for me, okay?

1480
01:22:18,567 --> 01:22:20,867
- Wait, I don't have a pen.

1481
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,166
I don't have a pen!

1482
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:24,767
- And you call yourself
a writer?

1483
01:22:27,166 --> 01:22:28,800
- Okay.

1484
01:22:30,033 --> 01:22:31,567
There you go.

1485
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:32,867
- Thank you.

1486
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,467
Thanks, babe.

1487
01:22:36,567 --> 01:22:38,900
- Of course.

1488
01:22:39,033 --> 01:22:41,500
- All in?
- All in.

1489
01:22:41,633 --> 01:22:43,400
- Where to, folks?

1490
01:22:43,533 --> 01:22:45,066
- Let's just ride.

1491
01:22:50,166 --> 01:22:51,433
- Walk on.

1492
01:22:51,567 --> 01:22:54,700
There we go.

1493
01:22:54,834 --> 01:22:56,734
- And for those readers
out there

1494
01:22:56,867 --> 01:22:58,767
wondering how this story ends,

1495
01:22:58,900 --> 01:23:01,633
well, I'm afraid
I don't really know.

1496
01:23:01,767 --> 01:23:03,800
But I will tell you one thing.

1497
01:23:03,934 --> 01:23:06,433
I believe in second chances.
