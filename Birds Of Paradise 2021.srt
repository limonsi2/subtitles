00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:42,770
-BRUNELLE: Stop the music!

4
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:44,855
-

5
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:53,113
What was that?

6
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,034
Glissade assemblé, sissonne...

7
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:01,205
You are a dancer...

8
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,582
-not a horse.
-I’m sorry.

9
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:04,917
I don’t speak French.

10
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,502
I took Spanish

11
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:08,337
’cause my dad said
it would be more useful,

12
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,422
but honestly,
French would be really useful...

13
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:12,550
-Why are you here?
-Um...

14
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,385
I’ve placed first
in every competition

15
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,512
in the States
for the past two years.

16
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:18,597
A-All my teachers
recommended that I...

17
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:21,392
Mademoiselle Sanders,
as a scholarship recipient,

18
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:24,353
I expect a real answer.

19
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:26,313
I’ll ask you one more time.

20
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:30,025
Why have you come here?

21
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,536
I’m here to win the prize.

22
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:11,901
CELINE:
Marine!

23
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,570
Marine!

24
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:24,288
I told you, you’re not allowed
to touch anything in this room.

25
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:28,459
You said you wanted to win
the prize for Ollie.

26
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,002
I do.

27
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:31,879
Then what are you still
doing here?

28
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,570
VALENTINE: Training will be
rigorous and begins before dawn.

29
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,615
The lowest-ranked rats
may be sent home

30
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,450
at the discretion
of Madame Brunelle.

31
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:03,661
Five girls and five boys

32
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,288
will be dancing
in the final presentation.

33
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:08,791
And from this,
only one girl and one boy

34
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:11,251
will be awarded the prize:

35
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:15,047
a contract to join the company
of the Paris Opera Ballet.

36
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:25,224
CLAIRE:
Who is she?

37
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:28,852
LUC: Apparently she only started
dancing five years ago.

38
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:30,479
Before that she
played basketball.

39
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:33,357
-Basketball?
-Oui.

40
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,026
CLAIRE: She’s too awkward
to be a ballerina.

41
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,424
LUC:
Oh, fuck.

42
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:00,509
What are you doing back?

43
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:02,386
Had nothing better to do.

44
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:03,762
What’s new?

45
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:06,849
After you left last fall,
Gia took number one.

46
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,268
She’s the favorite.

47
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:14,565
You’re back?

48
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,692
Nice to see you, too.

49
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:20,404
You broke out
of the mental hospital?

50
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,031
You flatter me.

51
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,868
Felipe... you’re up, baby.

52
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:40,049
How do my leftovers taste?

53
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:41,592
Like victory.

54
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:46,096
Hetero dancers are such sluts.

55
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,183
Cover my tattoos so the devil
doesn’t shit her Spanx.

56
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:55,064
CLAIRE:
Felipe’s so good.

57
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:56,899
LUC:
He’s the best.

58
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:01,153
If Ollie were here,
he’d be better.

59
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:03,572
No one is better than Felipe.

60
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:06,450
Ollie was always number one.

61
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,368
Who’s Ollie?

62
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:10,412
Who are you?

63
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:11,872
I’m Kate.

64
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:13,290
Hi.

65
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,375
I’m the one from Virginia.

66
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:17,836
GIA:
She’s here to take your place.

67
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:20,839
Oh, Ollie.

68
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:23,884
Yes, he was the dancer who...

69
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,303
He jumped off a bridge, right?

70
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,013
What’d you say?

71
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,183
M, stop...

72
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,852
-Uh...
-What the fuck did you say?

73
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:35,145
-I...
-He didn’t jump.

74
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:38,232
Sorry. I read a post that
he jumped off a bridge.

75
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,526
-

76
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,319
-DANCER: Oh, my God.
-DANCER 2: Stop!

77
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:53,956
MARINE
Putain, putain.

78
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:04,049
-

79
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:05,717
I’m gonna kill you!

80
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:07,636
I’m gonna fucking kill you!

81
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:14,977
FRANCIS:
Absolute perfection, Felipe.

82
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,645
Thank you.

83
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,438
He was the last rat?

84
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:21,108
-

85
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:29,408
So you decided
to join us after all.

86
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:32,161
Your parents made quite the case
for your return.

87
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:33,829
I’m not doing it for them.

88
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,914
I’m doing it for Ollie.

89
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,160
I’m Luc.

90
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:15,329
I’m Claire.

91
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,414
I don’t get it.

92
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,957
What did I do?

93
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,418
Ollie-- he was her brother.

94
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:24,963
He was her twin.

95
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:28,800
The other half of her soul.

96
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:31,887
Oh.

97
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,614
Just because
you were number one once

98
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,616
does not mean you will be again.

99
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,743
I will be number one.

100
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,833
You are dismissed, rat.

101
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,468
Two Americans?

102
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,262
One too many.

103
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:15,389
We won’t have two for long.

104
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:28,110
VALENTINE: Your appearance today
was unacceptable.

105
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,281
You’re extra-large, right?

106
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:35,701
Let me see if I can find
something that big.

107
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,381
That will be a hundred euros.

108
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:52,092
-Well, I’m on scholarship.
-Yes.

109
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:55,387
You have a scholarship
to attend as a foreign student.

110
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,598
It does not include
the expenses.

111
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:00,100
They didn’t tell me that.

112
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,229
Look.

113
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:06,940
You can jump very high
and move very strong.

114
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:09,192
This might make you
a sensation in America...

115
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,446
...but this is Paris.

116
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,614
Romance traditionnelle.

117
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:20,537
They want ballerinas
to be light and graceful.

118
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,082
They want girls to be girls
and boys to be boys,

119
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,710
and if you don’t fit
into that mold...

120
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:32,007
...they’ll simply
find somebody who does.

121
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:34,968
Trust me, I know.

122
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,804
You’re 18, yes?

123
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,974
Sign your consent here.

124
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:46,021
And your mobile phone please.

125
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,860
KATE:
It’s going well.

126
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,570
Everyone’s super French.

127
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,155
SCOTT
Yeah.

128
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,074
You making any friends?

129
00:10:58,617 --> 00:10:59,910
Uh... yeah.

130
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,161
Yeah.

131
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,872
People are... nice.

132
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,625
SCOTT:
Well, good. Good.

133
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:10,504
Billy Elliot says bonjour.

134
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:14,508
Bonjour, Billy.

135
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,676
The house feels empty
without you.

136
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,136
Well...

137
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,640
Hey, at least now you get to,
you know, get some sleep.

138
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:24,393
Not paying for my classes
and all that working so late.

139
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:26,728
Ah, I always sleep well.

140
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:28,230
Know why?

141
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:32,317
I go to bed with
a clean conscience.

142
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:34,528
You got that?

143
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:35,737
Got it.

144
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:38,907
SCOTT:
Where do stars come from?

145
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,243
KATE:
Rebel’s heart. Will of steel.

146
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:43,245
SCOTT:
Eyes set on true north.

147
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:46,289
I love you, Little Bird.

148
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,459
I love you, too, Dad.

149
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:02,514
What are you doing here?

150
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,057
MARINE:
I’m in my room.

151
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:06,309
No one said anything to me
about a roommate.

152
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,812
Well, this has been my room
since I was eight.

153
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:11,106
-Look.
-Oh.

154
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:13,859
Well, what are
we supposed to do?

155
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,402
There’s only one bed.

156
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:19,030
I know we got off
to kind of a rough start.

157
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:22,075
I honestly had no idea, and I’m
really sorry about your brother.

158
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,702
Okay? I really... didn’t...

159
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:01,239
Are you really gonna
smoke in here?

160
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:03,617
Yes.

161
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,494
Okay.

162
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:07,704
Isn’t that against the rules?

163
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:08,788
Yes.

164
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:10,248
Do you always follow the rules?

165
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:11,958
No.

166
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:15,462
Prove it.

167
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:29,559
20 euro.

168
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:32,562
BOUNCER:
Twenty.

169
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,086
Uh, no, thank you.

170
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,922
No one enters without the worm.

171
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,243
MARINE:
Want to play a game?

172
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,038
LUC
Is she okay?

173
00:15:56,748 --> 00:16:00,043
CLAIRE: Are you sure
this is a good idea?

174
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,003
MARINE:
She’s a big girl.

175
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,424
What kind of game?

176
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:09,594
Whoever stops dancing first
drops out.

177
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:13,264
-Of school?
-Yes.

178
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:15,767
Of school.

179
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,018
Oh.

180
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:19,270
You in or not?

181
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:23,942
I’m in.

182
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,276
Good.

183
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,458
-

184
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:27,589
My heart is on fire.

185
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,091
I think I might die.

186
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:31,968
You give up?

187
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:34,554
Never.

188
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:35,847
You?

189
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,849
Fuck no.

190
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:40,560
So what do we do?

191
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:42,270
We keep dancing.

192
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:45,774
-Fine.
-Fine.

193
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:49,360
We could both stop
at the exact same moment.

194
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,363
Nice try.

195
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:53,865
What?

196
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:56,117
You’ll just tell me to stop
and then you’d let me stop.

197
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:58,244
I would never do that.

198
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:00,914
Why should I trust you?

199
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:04,000
I’m gonna count to three.

200
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,879
And we’re gonna both stop

201
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:11,174
exactly... at three.

202
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,092
Not before.

203
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:15,637
Not after.

204
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,181
One.

205
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:21,059
Two.

206
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:25,355
Three.

207
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,632
What about tomorrow?

208
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,678
What about it?

209
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:01,182
Are we friends?

210
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:06,479
Tomorrow is tomorrow.

211
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,756
-

212
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:45,393
-Hey.
-Hey.

213
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,396
Why didn’t you wake me?

214
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:51,441
Set an alarm.

215
00:19:58,281 --> 00:19:59,866
What’s that?

216
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:02,410
It’s for luck. A charm.

217
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,704
LUC:
Claire never dances without it.

218
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,415
BRUNELLE:
The pas de deux...

219
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:13,254
...is chemistry made flesh.

220
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:15,131
The heart of ballet.

221
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:21,638
Dance is a ritual
of seduction, no?

222
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,848
Up, everybody.

223
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:32,440
Felipe...

224
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:36,027
...today you will pair with...

225
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:48,289
...Claire.

226
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:51,376
But, madame, I’ve been
his partner for three months.

227
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,336
He wouldn’t be able to lift you

228
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,463
with all the weight you gained
over Christmas.

229
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,132
Marine, Luc.

230
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:00,134
And Virginia

231
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:02,220
with... Jean Paul.

232
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:29,080
Try to relax.

233
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:30,581
I’m fine.

234
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:37,630
I’m a drug dealer.

235
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:40,258
If you need drugs,
I’ll deal them to you.

236
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:48,016
-Sorry.
-BRUNELLE: Heavy, Virginia.

237
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:52,603
Light. Be light.

238
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:55,440
And down.

239
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:59,360
You look like a sack
of potatoes.

240
00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:09,954
Madame Brunelle
is just testing you.

241
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:12,790
That’s why we call her
Le Diable.

242
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:14,584
She plays us off each other.

243
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:17,378
Anyone who partners with Felipe
will be the better dancer.

244
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:20,506
He’s the key to the prize.

245
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:24,927
She’ll assign final partners
based on chemistry.

246
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:29,682
In the meantime,
she’s torturing me, too.

247
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:32,685
Le diable obtient
ce qui lui est dû.

248
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:33,895
What does that mean?

249
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:36,105
The Devil gets her due.

250
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:45,198
BRUNELLE:
You’re currently ranking last.

251
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:47,075
I think it’s better
to send you home now.

252
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:48,659
KATE:
No. I know I can do better.

253
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:50,661
BRUNELLE: Let me tell you
something, Virginia.

254
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:52,580
Kate.

255
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:53,915
My name is Kate.

256
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:55,541
And I can’t go back.

257
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,043
I’ve given up everything
to be here.

258
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:59,504
Now we’re getting somewhere.

259
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:01,714
Let me tell you something, Kate.

260
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:06,010
This rat was caught in one of
our traps in the basement.

261
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:09,263
I never use wire traps.

262
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:10,640
Do you know why?

263
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:14,852
Tonight I plan to take it home
and feed it to my cat.

264
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:17,021
She prefers her meat fresh.

265
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:20,483
You just press this button here,

266
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:24,695
and it releases a gas
that gently...

267
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:26,989
puts the rat to death.

268
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:29,283
Painless.

269
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:30,535
Clean.

270
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:31,786
I’m not a monster.

271
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:36,165
If we don’t get rid of the rats,

272
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:39,335
then the school will be overrun
and it will be worthless.

273
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,088
Greatness has a price.

274
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:43,881
Do you agree?

275
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:47,552
Yes.

276
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:49,971
Good.

277
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:52,140
Then do the honors.

278
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:58,146
You want me... to push the...

279
00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:00,439
Please. Push the button.

280
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:06,195
Show me that you have
what it takes to win the prize.

281
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:17,081
The devil pulled the rat trick
on Kate.

282
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:18,416
Really?

283
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:21,002
CLAIRE: The button
is so obviously fake.

284
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:23,254
I believed it.

285
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:25,256
She brought Ollie and I into
her office when we were nine

286
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:26,883
and did the same thing.

287
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:29,594
Which one of you
pushed the button?

288
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:30,928
Oh, neither of us.

289
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,640
Don’t tell me you pushed it.

290
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:36,184
Of course not.

291
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,563
76 euro?

292
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:42,064
Such a rip off.

293
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:44,901
They know we have to buy new
shoes each week. It’s extortion.

294
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,445
I bet the devil gets kickbacks
from this fucking store.

295
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:49,447
Ballet Mafia.

296
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:54,035
Aren’t you getting any?

297
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:55,828
Uh, no. My shoes are fine.

298
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:57,914
CLAIRE:
M...

299
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:37,578
-MARINE: Come over here.

300
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:25,126
-

301
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:29,588
Are you okay?

302
00:26:31,132 --> 00:26:34,343
It’s not easy competing with
a bunch of skinny white girls.

303
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:37,346
For me, every little mistake
gets noticed.

304
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:40,599
I have to dance miracles
just to be the exception.

305
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:44,603
I do what it takes.

306
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:49,233
Good luck with your shoes.

307
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,358
Oh.

308
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:32,318
-Oh.
-Sorry.

309
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,946
Um, I was wondering, um,

310
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,115
if maybe...

311
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:40,201
you could dance with me
sometime.

312
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:44,121
I know I’m, like, really tall,
but you’re tall

313
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:47,291
and appear strong and--
I don’t know.

314
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:51,128
Um, maybe you could help me
with some stuff.

315
00:27:51,212 --> 00:27:52,880
Like partnering and stuff.

316
00:27:57,218 --> 00:27:59,470
Okay. Come in.

317
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:02,473
Like right now?

318
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:11,440
Okay, lay down.

319
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:16,320
Do you want my help?

320
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,346
Keep your hips even.

321
00:28:43,848 --> 00:28:45,683
Floating.

322
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:54,650
To be a star
you have to be soft.

323
00:29:00,156 --> 00:29:02,158
Your form is very strict.

324
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:04,034
Very controlled.

325
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,586
Okay, so get up
and à la seconde.

326
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:23,095
Arabesque and face the door.

327
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:29,602
Ballet is precision
and perfection.

328
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:33,522
But so what?
Nobody pays to see perfection.

329
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,693
They pay to see romance.

330
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:40,905
Desire, dominance.

331
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:42,865
Bodies touching bodies.

332
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,286
What makes a perfect
prima ballerina

333
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:49,371
is total submission.

334
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:53,417
Allow yourself to be possessed.

335
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:03,886
Okay, fall back.

336
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,600
No thinking. Breathe.

337
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:14,647
You’re beautiful.

338
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:08,659
Is something wrong?

339
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:12,705
Don’t tell M.

340
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:24,883
Where are you going?

341
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,427
MARINE:
Embassy party.

342
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,970
That’s cool.

343
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,388
MARINE:
I’d skip it, but I have to go.

344
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:31,390
I’m the ambassador’s daughter.

345
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,225
KATE:
Which ambassador?

346
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:35,561
The American ambassador.

347
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:38,772
Your dad is the
American ambassador to France?

348
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:42,151
My mom is
the American ambassador.

349
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:43,652
How come you never told me this?

350
00:31:43,736 --> 00:31:45,237
It never came up.

351
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,657
What does your dad do?

352
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:49,908
Businessman.

353
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:52,119
We should talk about
gender expectations.

354
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:54,997
What type of businessman?

355
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,290
Mostly milks.

356
00:31:58,459 --> 00:32:00,044
Why is that funny?

357
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:01,837
Milks?

358
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:06,467
Macadamia, soy, coconut,
almond, cashews.

359
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:09,303
Squeezable nuts.

360
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:11,972
Your mom is
the American ambassador

361
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:14,642
and your dad is
a nut milk tycoon.

362
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:16,560
So?

363
00:32:16,644 --> 00:32:19,605
My dad pours concrete
in Wakefield.

364
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:21,398
MARINE:
What about your mom?

365
00:32:21,482 --> 00:32:23,525
KATE:
It’s just me and my dad.

366
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:25,277
It’s nothing.

367
00:32:25,361 --> 00:32:27,446
That one’s nice.

368
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:29,031
Will you help me
with the buttons?

369
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,324
Sure.

370
00:32:38,666 --> 00:32:41,335
What does this mean?

371
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:42,836
"Never mind."

372
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:44,880
Okay.

373
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,424
No, it-it means...

374
00:32:47,508 --> 00:32:49,134
"never mind."

375
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:51,011
Oh.

376
00:32:51,095 --> 00:32:52,346
Ça ne fait rien.

377
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:55,057
I like it.

378
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,643
You never answered my question
about your mom.

379
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:59,103
She was a dancer, actually.

380
00:33:01,105 --> 00:33:02,856
Yeah.

381
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:10,155
She died when I was little.

382
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:11,740
MARINE:
She’s beautiful.

383
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:13,075
KATE:
Yeah.

384
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:17,579
My dad refuses
to talk about her.

385
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,041
I think it hurts too much.

386
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:26,088
But when I quit basketball
and started dancing...

387
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:28,924
...I could tell it meant a lot.

388
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:31,885
It’s stupid, but, um...

389
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:36,682
...when I dance...

390
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:38,809
it feels like...

391
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,936
I can feel her.

392
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,563
You know? Like she’s with me.

393
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:00,622
"How are your classes?"

394
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:02,040
Oh, they’re-they’re good.

395
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:04,042
"Any new friends?"

396
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:06,170
Well, my roommate--
she’s American.

397
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:07,463
-She’s fun.
-E-Enough.

398
00:34:11,175 --> 00:34:12,760
Katherine Sanders.

399
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,513
You know her?

400
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:18,974
She’s the recipient of
the scholarship we established

401
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,392
in your brother’s honor.

402
00:34:21,435 --> 00:34:23,270
How come you-you didn’t tell me?

403
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:24,813
I hear she may be
sent home soon.

404
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:26,607
Can’t you just talk
to the school?

405
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,442
Isn’t she supposed to be
your competition?

406
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:30,277
If we’d known they were
gonna give the money

407
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,238
to a female dancer, we would
never have sent the check.

408
00:34:33,322 --> 00:34:34,948
She’s my friend.

409
00:34:35,032 --> 00:34:36,617
Boundaries, Marine.

410
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:46,627
-

411
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:07,147
Marine, can I see you please?

412
00:35:08,482 --> 00:35:12,152
Your daughter is
quite... fascinating.

413
00:35:12,236 --> 00:35:14,238
Spirited.

414
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:17,199
You’ll excuse me, I’m sure.

415
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:21,036
What is this?

416
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,039
Oh, this, uh...

417
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,749
this charade
you invited me to perform

418
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:27,751
where we pretend to be
a happy family.

419
00:35:27,835 --> 00:35:30,462
You listen to me very carefully.

420
00:35:30,546 --> 00:35:33,131
Tonight is not an obligation
which is subject to your moods.

421
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:35,467
WOMAN:
Look at you, Marine.

422
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:38,095
Ambassador Durand,
your daughter has grown.

423
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:40,430
Just about.

424
00:35:40,514 --> 00:35:42,516
Oh, Marine is
quite the dancer now.

425
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:46,061
She’s on track to join
the Paris Opera Ballet.

426
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,813
-If all goes well.
-Wow.

427
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:50,732
Well, we’d love
to see you dance sometime.

428
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:53,652
I’m sure she’d be happy to.

429
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:55,279
N’est-ce pas, Marine?

430
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:57,489
Sure.

431
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:56,048
For your bloody feet.

432
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:57,591
I’d offer to wash them for you,

433
00:36:57,674 --> 00:36:59,885
but I think that might sound
a little creepy.

434
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:02,262
A little?

435
00:37:02,346 --> 00:37:04,473
S-Sorry. That was so dumb.

436
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:07,517
-I’ll leave you alone.
-No, no, I, uh...

437
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:13,523
I just don’t let boys
look at or touch my feet.

438
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:15,567
It’s a dancer thing.

439
00:37:15,651 --> 00:37:18,111
And I strongly prefer
women in socks.

440
00:37:18,195 --> 00:37:19,613
It’s a drummer thing.

441
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:22,282
My name’s Jamal.

442
00:37:24,368 --> 00:37:25,577
M.

443
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,163
Just M?

444
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:34,127
Short for Marine,
but I never liked that.

445
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:39,424
My brother used to call me
Marionette.

446
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:42,177
Like the puppet.

447
00:37:44,638 --> 00:37:48,225
And so... should I call you
Marionette?

448
00:37:51,687 --> 00:37:53,105
Close your eyes.

449
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:02,948
JAMAL:
Do they hurt?

450
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:05,450
MARINE: Let me tell you a
little secret about ballerinas.

451
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:08,912
We are warriors of pain.

452
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:11,206
Oh, shit.

453
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:14,835
Why do you do it?

454
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:22,592
Because if I stop, then, um...

455
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:24,970
someone I love will be gone.

456
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:31,351
Your brother?

457
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:35,397
It was always supposed to be
the two of us.

458
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:40,694
My mom put us in ballet class
as soon as we could walk.

459
00:38:42,863 --> 00:38:44,281
It’s who I am.

460
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:50,037
You must think
I’m really fucked-up.

461
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:53,874
I think you’re sad.

462
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,085
And funny.

463
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:00,172
And a very good dancer.

464
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,012
Are you with an embassy?

465
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:08,221
No, I...

466
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:10,557
I’m with the band.

467
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,184
Well, that’s good because, uh...

468
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:14,936
um...

469
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,563
then we won’t
see each other again,

470
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:19,316
and we can just pretend this...

471
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:20,817
never happened.

472
00:39:22,611 --> 00:39:25,530
The problem is
I want to see you again.

473
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:29,993
That’s a bad idea.

474
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:32,621
I have poor judgment.

475
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:37,084
I don’t have any time.

476
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:39,169
Then we better move fast.

477
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:47,886
SCOTT
Scott Sanders.

478
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:49,638
-You know what to do.
-

479
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:51,223
KATE:
Hey, Dad.

480
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:52,808
Sorry I keep missing your calls.

481
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:55,936
Um, everything’s good here.

482
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:58,188
Things are going really well.

483
00:39:58,271 --> 00:39:59,523
Yeah.

484
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:01,525
-I love you.
-

485
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:10,117
Hey.

486
00:40:11,118 --> 00:40:12,369
Hey.

487
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:15,413
How was it?

488
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,545
I acted out,
as my therapist would say.

489
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:23,046
Mm.

490
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:26,842
What’s wrong?

491
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:32,347
I just keep thinking about
this story

492
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,433
my dad used to tell me
when I was a kid.

493
00:40:35,517 --> 00:40:38,353
I was afraid of the dark.

494
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,063
Will you tell it to me?

495
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:42,983
You really want to hear it?

496
00:40:44,401 --> 00:40:45,944
Okay.

497
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:49,823
The animals were behaving badly.

498
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:53,451
So the gods decided
to cover the entire Earth

499
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:56,079
with a blanket,
blocking out the sun.

500
00:40:57,122 --> 00:40:58,999
It was so dark.

501
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:01,376
So dark.

502
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,212
The animals were afraid.

503
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:06,631
But the gods did not answer
their prayers.

504
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,343
But then...

505
00:41:10,427 --> 00:41:13,847
this one brave little bird

506
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,765
flew up to the sky.

507
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,310
Faster and faster.

508
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:23,356
Her heart was beating so fast
she thought it might burst.

509
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:26,985
But she just kept going.

510
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:31,364
Rebel’s heart.

511
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:34,242
Will of steel.

512
00:41:36,203 --> 00:41:38,413
Eyes set on true north.

513
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:44,502
Until finally...

514
00:41:46,046 --> 00:41:49,049
...she pierced the blanket
with her beak,

515
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:51,551
and a tiny ray of light
shone through.

516
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:56,932
The little bird flew back up

517
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:59,267
again and again,

518
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:02,103
poking holes in the blanket,

519
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:04,773
defying the will of the gods.

520
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:08,526
But the gods were not mad.

521
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:13,615
The gods were so moved
by her courage

522
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:15,700
they decided they were
only going to cover the Earth

523
00:42:15,784 --> 00:42:17,619
for half of the day.

524
00:42:19,246 --> 00:42:22,791
And so, this blanket,

525
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:26,044
full of these tiny holes

526
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:27,837
became the night sky.

527
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:36,304
And that’s how
the stars were formed.

528
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:55,949
I don’t want to win if...

529
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:57,867
if it means you lose.

530
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:08,086
I’ll help you.

531
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:13,633
And we’ll both dance so well...

532
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:16,636
...they won’t have a choice.

533
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:20,140
And they’ll have to
make an exception.

534
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:25,186
And we’ll both get the prize.

535
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:29,733
I like that.

536
00:43:35,447 --> 00:43:37,073
Give me your earring.

537
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,753
-Is this real?
-Mm-hmm.

538
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:51,963
-I can’t take this.
-I don’t care. Come on.

539
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:10,732
Let’s make a pact.

540
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:19,908
Repeat after me.

541
00:44:21,201 --> 00:44:24,412
-This is our sacred oath.
-This is our sacred oath.

542
00:44:24,496 --> 00:44:26,206
To always be there
for each other.

543
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:27,916
To always be
there for each other.

544
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:31,586
To help each other out
every step of the way.

545
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,797
To help each other
out every step of the way.

546
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:37,884
And to win the prize together...

547
00:44:37,967 --> 00:44:39,302
or not at all.

548
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:45,100
And to win the prize together...

549
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,684
or not at all.

550
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:05,620
you’ve got to say to me

551
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:06,746
-

552
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:10,083
to hear the truth

553
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:13,461
at all, you see...

554
00:45:13,545 --> 00:45:14,671
Thank you.

555
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:16,756
You’re a bigfoot, Virginia.

556
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:22,637
What were you and Gia
talking about?

557
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,139
Oh, nothing.

558
00:45:26,015 --> 00:45:28,476
She’s still pissed at me
because Felipe dumped her.

559
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,811
KATE:
Mm-hmm.

560
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:31,438
She needs to get over it.

561
00:45:31,521 --> 00:45:33,523
CLAIRE: M, telephone.
Some guy named Jamal.

562
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:36,359
-KATE: The drummer?
-MARINE: Mm-hmm.

563
00:45:39,863 --> 00:45:42,532
CLAIRE:
I see the way you look at her.

564
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:44,325
You should be careful.

565
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:47,036
She’ll make you think
that you’re her new twin.

566
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,746
But when it comes
to competition,

567
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:50,748
you get the knife in the back.

568
00:45:50,832 --> 00:45:53,418
for you

569
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,894
Still so boyish.

570
00:46:12,896 --> 00:46:17,317
yesterday

571
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:22,572
from the start

572
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:26,701
that I could claim the same

573
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:29,704
you held my heart...

574
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,164
What is this?

575
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:34,792
Modifying the choreography.
Who does she think she is?

576
00:46:34,876 --> 00:46:36,169
-Stop.

577
00:46:38,755 --> 00:46:39,881
I’m sorry.

578
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:42,717
I wanted to show you
my own ideas.

579
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,594
I can see that.

580
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:48,640
Had you not, you would have been
ranked number one today.

581
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:50,141
So please.

582
00:46:54,771 --> 00:46:56,314
What happened?

583
00:46:56,397 --> 00:46:58,233
Just until your rank goes up.

584
00:46:59,234 --> 00:47:00,818
I meant what I said.

585
00:47:00,902 --> 00:47:02,820
Both of us or none at all.

586
00:47:05,073 --> 00:47:06,449
Claire, à toi.

587
00:47:06,533 --> 00:47:07,992
What’s wrong?

588
00:47:08,076 --> 00:47:09,494
My ribbon-- I can’t find it.

589
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:10,870
Her ribbon.

590
00:47:10,954 --> 00:47:13,706
Don’t panic. We’ll help find it.

591
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:17,293
Are you sure
you checked in your bag?

592
00:47:17,377 --> 00:47:18,586
Of course I looked there!

593
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:20,380
Well, check again.

594
00:47:22,632 --> 00:47:24,926
Claire,
we won’t wait any longer.

595
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:26,344
Look at me.

596
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:28,137
You are a great dancer,
with or without your ribbon.

597
00:47:28,221 --> 00:47:29,847
Go.

598
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:32,892
I know it was you.

599
00:47:35,103 --> 00:47:36,604
What did she say?

600
00:47:36,688 --> 00:47:38,064
Nothing.

601
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:44,404
Why have you not come
to see me, Marionette?

602
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:46,447
-Don’t call me that.
-Why not?

603
00:47:46,531 --> 00:47:47,657
You know why.

604
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:50,201
-

605
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:04,007
MARINE:
Dead rats.

606
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:06,634
It’s a fight for survival now.

607
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:29,324
JEAN PAUL:
Hello, American girl.

608
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:31,034
I knew you would come to see me.

609
00:48:32,493 --> 00:48:35,079
Pink’s for up
and blue’s for down.

610
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:39,584
I don’t need drugs to dance.

611
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:41,169
Well, you are the exception.

612
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:42,795
Everyone else does.

613
00:48:42,879 --> 00:48:45,256
You can ask your friend M.

614
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:47,967
She hasn’t come to see me
since she’s back.

615
00:48:48,051 --> 00:48:50,678
That’s why her rank
is not as good as before.

616
00:48:51,721 --> 00:48:54,599
Hey, there’s no testing
in ballet.

617
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:56,893
No one will ask you
to pee in a cup.

618
00:49:10,198 --> 00:49:13,493
I thee endow

619
00:49:24,337 --> 00:49:27,757
God’s holy ordinance

620
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:45,983
I thee endow

621
00:49:51,698 --> 00:49:55,201
God’s holy ordinance

622
00:49:58,579 --> 00:50:00,248
your consent

623
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:03,376
with blessings

624
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:07,130
until death do us part

625
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:12,510
until death do us part

626
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:17,348
until death do us part

627
00:50:19,851 --> 00:50:21,310
Good, Ms. Sanders.

628
00:50:21,394 --> 00:50:23,020
Go for it.

629
00:50:23,104 --> 00:50:24,856
Good. That’s almost it.

630
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:28,401
There you go, lighter. Good.

631
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:31,028
with blessings

632
00:50:39,912 --> 00:50:41,581
-

633
00:50:41,664 --> 00:50:45,168
until death do us part

634
00:50:58,765 --> 00:51:01,225
VALENTINE:
Marine, wake up.

635
00:51:01,309 --> 00:51:02,935
Where’s your head?

636
00:51:03,019 --> 00:51:07,440
until death do us part

637
00:51:07,523 --> 00:51:09,692
for better, for worse

638
00:51:11,986 --> 00:51:16,449
until death do us part

639
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:25,208
JAMAL:
What are you thinking?

640
00:51:28,211 --> 00:51:29,712
That I should go.

641
00:51:32,757 --> 00:51:34,175
Says who?

642
00:51:36,385 --> 00:51:38,221
You make me happy.

643
00:51:40,932 --> 00:51:42,558
It’s dangerous.

644
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:46,979
You’re right.

645
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:50,525
I am very dangerous.

646
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:51,984
What are you doing?
What are you...

647
00:51:52,068 --> 00:51:54,445
Ah, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

648
00:51:54,529 --> 00:51:56,197
I’m not gonna look.

649
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,032
I won’t look, I promise.

650
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:00,117
I just want to...

651
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:04,247
You can look.

652
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:24,350
These feet belong to a dancer,
not a marionette.

653
00:52:24,433 --> 00:52:26,811
There’s more to you
than just ballet.

654
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:28,104
I’ve seen it.

655
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:31,691
You’re an artist, not a puppet.

656
00:52:36,696 --> 00:52:38,030
Shoulders down.

657
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:46,914
Look at you. That’s good.

658
00:52:46,998 --> 00:52:48,624
Come closer.

659
00:52:51,961 --> 00:52:53,880
KATE:
I’m finally up to number two.

660
00:52:53,963 --> 00:52:55,965
And Madame Brunelle,
the one who doesn’t like me,

661
00:52:56,048 --> 00:52:58,217
well, she finally paired me with
the best dancer in the school.

662
00:52:58,301 --> 00:52:59,719
She saw we have chemistry

663
00:52:59,802 --> 00:53:02,805
and, well,
we’re basically unstoppable.

664
00:53:02,889 --> 00:53:05,558
SCOTT: You do your best.
You do the right thing.

665
00:53:05,641 --> 00:53:07,435
That’s all I care about.

666
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:10,396
Katie, I’ve got to
tell you something.

667
00:53:10,479 --> 00:53:11,606
What?

668
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:14,233
I moved into an apartment
closer to town.

669
00:53:16,027 --> 00:53:17,695
What about the house?

670
00:53:17,778 --> 00:53:19,530
I sold it.

671
00:53:19,614 --> 00:53:21,449
You sold our house?

672
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,910
-Without telling me?
-

673
00:53:23,993 --> 00:53:26,412
I didn’t want to upset you.

674
00:53:26,495 --> 00:53:28,664
We both got a lot
to worry about, Kate.

675
00:53:28,748 --> 00:53:31,959
The house, the dog--
it’s a lot for me, okay?

676
00:53:32,043 --> 00:53:35,463
Well, I guess
I better win, right?

677
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:37,965
It’s not like there’s any home
to come back to.

678
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:48,559
-KATE: Hey.
-Hey.

679
00:53:53,064 --> 00:53:55,483
Do you have something
you want to tell me?

680
00:53:57,318 --> 00:53:59,946
Mm, what do you mean?

681
00:54:00,029 --> 00:54:02,281
Why do you have Claire’s ribbon?

682
00:54:09,664 --> 00:54:11,666
I saw it on the ground, and I...

683
00:54:14,335 --> 00:54:16,337
...I just...

684
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:17,838
picked it up.

685
00:54:19,966 --> 00:54:22,343
I was going to give it
back to her.

686
00:54:24,136 --> 00:54:27,348
She just got so upset; I didn’t
want her to think I stole it.

687
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:31,852
You should have
said something to me.

688
00:54:33,354 --> 00:54:34,855
I know.

689
00:54:36,399 --> 00:54:37,608
I’m sorry.

690
00:54:46,325 --> 00:54:48,327
I didn’t mean
for her to get hurt.

691
00:54:56,752 --> 00:54:58,754
It’s the worst thing
I’ve ever done.

692
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:05,636
Are you gonna turn me in?

693
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:15,479
I’m sorry
I went through your bag.

694
00:55:16,939 --> 00:55:18,441
It’s fine.

695
00:55:18,524 --> 00:55:20,776
I thought you were taking pills.

696
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:25,990
You seem on edge lately.

697
00:55:26,073 --> 00:55:27,908
And I know what that’s like.

698
00:55:37,126 --> 00:55:40,755
I had a dream about
the story you told me.

699
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:42,465
About the little bird.

700
00:55:44,592 --> 00:55:47,178
She fell from the sky.

701
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:49,138
Her body was broken.

702
00:55:50,431 --> 00:55:52,433
She was in so much pain.

703
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:57,146
But then another bird appeared.

704
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:02,276
She helped her fly again.

705
00:56:24,465 --> 00:56:26,842
That’s going to be you one day.

706
00:57:01,377 --> 00:57:04,004
Giselle, my love!

707
00:57:04,088 --> 00:57:06,173
-Don’t go.
-I must leave you.

708
00:57:06,257 --> 00:57:08,175
My heart will ache
for all of eternity!

709
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:11,762
GIA:
Shut the fuck up!

710
00:57:11,846 --> 00:57:13,347
-People are trying to sleep!

711
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:15,057
Sorry!

712
00:57:15,891 --> 00:57:17,143
Sorry!

713
00:57:18,727 --> 00:57:21,480
Good night, Gia. Sleep well.

714
00:57:21,564 --> 00:57:23,190
Sleep well, Gia.

715
00:57:23,274 --> 00:57:24,692
GIA:
Fuck off!

716
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:26,443
-I have an idea.
-What?

717
00:57:27,653 --> 00:57:29,697
-You have a phone?
-I gave them a burner.

718
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,407
-Come here.
-Ah, genius.

719
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:41,750
KATE:
What? What are you doing?

720
00:57:41,834 --> 00:57:43,752
Wait, is that Benjamin Benjamin?

721
00:57:43,836 --> 00:57:45,880
Like, Benjamin,
star of the ballet

722
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:48,424
-that we just saw, Benjamin?
-Mm-hmm.

723
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:49,717
Holy fuck.

724
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:53,804
Oh, my God, he’s typing.

725
00:57:53,888 --> 00:57:55,014
MARINE:
Come on.

726
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:56,223
Oh, we see you.

727
00:57:56,307 --> 00:57:58,350
We know you’re there.

728
00:57:58,434 --> 00:57:59,602
-

729
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:01,145
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. -Be cool.

730
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:02,354
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

731
00:58:02,438 --> 00:58:04,773
BENJAMIN
Hi there. Do I know you?

732
00:58:04,857 --> 00:58:05,983
You look familiar.

733
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:07,193
You need a hint?

734
00:58:07,276 --> 00:58:08,736
You’re the Durand daughter.

735
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:10,487
"The Durand daughter."

736
00:58:10,571 --> 00:58:12,573
This is my friend Kate.

737
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:14,366
She dances at the academy
with me.

738
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:16,327
Hi. Uh, Kate.

739
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:17,536
You were amazing.

740
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:19,246
I can’t believe
I’m talking to you.

741
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:21,332
Benjamin, are you
going to be the judge

742
00:58:21,415 --> 00:58:23,417
-for the prize again this year?
-Yes, I am.

743
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,003
Have two girls ever won before?

744
00:58:26,086 --> 00:58:27,713
Nope. Tradition.

745
00:58:27,796 --> 00:58:30,090
And traditions are
meant to be broken.

746
00:58:30,174 --> 00:58:31,383
You never know.

747
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:36,096
-Good night, girls.
-Good night.

748
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:37,973
Bonne nuit.

749
00:58:38,057 --> 00:58:39,308
-

750
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:40,893
How do you have
his phone number?

751
00:58:40,976 --> 00:58:43,312
-

752
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:45,231
CELINE:
He’ll be here in a moment.

753
00:58:50,152 --> 00:58:52,363
Have they assigned
final partners?

754
00:58:56,242 --> 00:58:57,409
KATE:
Not yet.

755
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:00,871
We think they’ll announce it
in the next couple of weeks

756
00:59:00,955 --> 00:59:03,666
once they’ve narrowed it down
to the top five.

757
00:59:03,749 --> 00:59:05,584
Will Marine make the cut?

758
00:59:05,668 --> 00:59:07,503
I hear she’s right on the edge.

759
00:59:07,586 --> 00:59:10,047
Of course she will.

760
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:13,217
When Marine danced with Ollie,
they were always number one.

761
00:59:15,261 --> 00:59:17,263
Ollie would’ve been
the next Nureyev.

762
00:59:17,346 --> 00:59:19,640
-He was that good.
-He wasn’t the next Nureyev.

763
00:59:19,723 --> 00:59:21,558
How would you know?

764
00:59:21,642 --> 00:59:23,352
You’re not even on track
to be the next member

765
00:59:23,435 --> 00:59:25,312
of the corps de ballet.

766
00:59:25,396 --> 00:59:27,022
I don’t feel well.

767
00:59:34,863 --> 00:59:38,534
KATE: I wanted to say thank you
for the scholarship.

768
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:40,869
I know it’s supposed
to be anonymous,

769
00:59:40,953 --> 00:59:42,830
so I wasn’t
going to say anything.

770
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:44,581
Um...

771
00:59:44,665 --> 00:59:46,292
but M told me.

772
00:59:48,002 --> 00:59:49,920
It means everything.

773
00:59:52,423 --> 00:59:55,509
I just wanted to say
it means even more to me

774
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:58,637
to know that
it’s in Ollie’s name.

775
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:01,640
I know how close he and M were.

776
01:00:01,724 --> 01:00:03,350
Yes.

777
01:00:05,728 --> 01:00:07,563
But now she has you.

778
01:01:24,348 --> 01:01:27,351
This is our sacred oath.

779
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:30,354
To always be there
for each other.

780
01:01:30,437 --> 01:01:33,357
To help each other
every step of the way.

781
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,860
To win the prize together
or not at all.

782
01:02:17,526 --> 01:02:19,278
She hates me.

783
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:20,988
No.

784
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:25,159
I don’t blame her.

785
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:31,498
It was my fault.

786
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:35,919
-It wasn’t your fault.
-You don’t know that.

787
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:47,055
Ollie and I-- we were like...

788
01:02:47,139 --> 01:02:48,932
the same person.

789
01:02:54,021 --> 01:02:55,522
My mom...

790
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:03,030
What?

791
01:03:05,365 --> 01:03:06,575
Hey.

792
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:09,953
You can tell me anything.

793
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:12,706
Anything.

794
01:03:13,749 --> 01:03:15,334
I promise.

795
01:03:28,096 --> 01:03:30,933
We were home on summer holiday.

796
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:34,311
Ollie and I.

797
01:03:36,897 --> 01:03:39,316
We were just rehearsing
in the living room.

798
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,239
We’d moved all the furniture
to the side

799
01:03:45,322 --> 01:03:47,533
like we used to do
when we were little.

800
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:55,916
And she, um...

801
01:04:00,128 --> 01:04:01,838
She walked in.

802
01:04:01,922 --> 01:04:03,715
We didn’t know she was home.

803
01:04:05,676 --> 01:04:08,303
And she screamed.

804
01:04:08,387 --> 01:04:09,805
So loud.

805
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:13,725
And she pulled us apart...

806
01:04:13,809 --> 01:04:15,811
and she slapped me.

807
01:04:22,442 --> 01:04:24,361
And then she told my dad
what she saw--

808
01:04:24,444 --> 01:04:26,446
what she thought she saw.

809
01:04:27,906 --> 01:04:29,908
He didn’t believe her.

810
01:04:34,121 --> 01:04:36,582
She wouldn’t listen to anyone.

811
01:04:39,001 --> 01:04:41,503
We were just dancing, but...

812
01:04:43,297 --> 01:04:46,967
...my mom couldn’t look at
either of us after that.

813
01:04:52,431 --> 01:04:53,640
Ollie...

814
01:04:58,186 --> 01:04:59,521
...he...

815
01:05:02,024 --> 01:05:03,817
...he-- we’d...

816
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:06,695
we had taken pills to dance.

817
01:05:08,196 --> 01:05:10,532
But after that, he just...

818
01:05:10,616 --> 01:05:12,784
he started taking everything.

819
01:05:12,868 --> 01:05:14,870
Whatever he could find.

820
01:05:19,374 --> 01:05:21,376
And the night it happened...

821
01:05:24,004 --> 01:05:25,631
...he called me.

822
01:05:28,258 --> 01:05:32,054
And I d...
I d... I didn’t answer.

823
01:05:32,137 --> 01:05:34,848
I didn’t answer.

824
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:36,892
OLLIE
What happened to our promise?

825
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:39,853
Never mind, right?

826
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:41,647
Okay. Never mind.

827
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:45,400
Ça ne fait rien.

828
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:53,450
What happened to our promise?

829
01:05:54,493 --> 01:05:56,536
Never mind, right?

830
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:58,455
Okay. Never mind.

831
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:02,209
Ça ne fait rien.

832
01:06:08,173 --> 01:06:10,926
KATE: I have something
to tell you, too.

833
01:06:12,427 --> 01:06:13,804
MARINE
I already know.

834
01:06:16,932 --> 01:06:18,517
You do?

835
01:06:22,229 --> 01:06:23,939
MARINE:
Felipe told me.

836
01:06:24,022 --> 01:06:26,441
Thought it would
make me jealous.

837
01:06:30,821 --> 01:06:32,322
Were you?

838
01:06:33,865 --> 01:06:35,283
MARINE:
At first.

839
01:06:38,036 --> 01:06:40,414
And then I realized

840
01:06:40,497 --> 01:06:43,667
it wasn’t because
you were with Felipe, but...

841
01:06:45,419 --> 01:06:47,587
...because Felipe was with you.

842
01:06:58,849 --> 01:07:00,851
KATE:
He thinks he has all the power.

843
01:07:08,233 --> 01:07:10,235
That we’re all in love with him.

844
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:17,052
KATE: I just want to know
what it feels like.

845
01:08:18,595 --> 01:08:19,805
MARINE:
What?

846
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:23,308
KATE:
To be you.

847
01:09:03,598 --> 01:09:04,808
Hi.

848
01:09:08,812 --> 01:09:10,021
Hi.

849
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:13,775
What are you doing here?

850
01:09:13,859 --> 01:09:15,610
I don’t know.

851
01:09:15,694 --> 01:09:17,821
You just stopped
answering my calls.

852
01:09:19,364 --> 01:09:21,908
And now I kind of
feel like a stalker.

853
01:09:21,992 --> 01:09:24,244
Maybe you are one.

854
01:09:25,912 --> 01:09:27,789
So that’s it?

855
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:33,128
I went by your house.

856
01:09:34,462 --> 01:09:37,173
I didn’t know
how else to contact you.

857
01:09:37,257 --> 01:09:39,551
I talked to your mom.

858
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:41,636
Do you know what she said?

859
01:09:45,932 --> 01:09:49,144
She said
your idea of love was sick,

860
01:09:49,227 --> 01:09:52,981
that you were disturbed
and that I should stay away.

861
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:55,400
She’s right.

862
01:09:59,112 --> 01:10:01,323
Good luck with your prize.

863
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:08,622
-KATE: Dad, guess what.
-SCOTT: What?

864
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:09,915
KATE:
I made the top five.

865
01:10:09,998 --> 01:10:11,958
SCOTT:
Of course you did.

866
01:10:12,042 --> 01:10:14,711
Aw, that’s wonderful, Katie.

867
01:10:14,794 --> 01:10:19,382
BRUNELLE: Felipe,
today you will pair with...

868
01:10:19,466 --> 01:10:21,509
KATE: I mean, honestly,
the way that things are going,

869
01:10:21,593 --> 01:10:23,345
I think they’re gonna
make Felipe my partner

870
01:10:23,428 --> 01:10:25,263
for the prize dance.

871
01:10:33,438 --> 01:10:34,439
KATE:
Bonjour.

872
01:10:36,816 --> 01:10:38,068
I need new shoes.

873
01:10:38,151 --> 01:10:40,570
I’m done helping you.

874
01:10:40,654 --> 01:10:42,530
There are only five of us left.

875
01:10:42,614 --> 01:10:44,115
You’re on your own now.

876
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:48,495
My shoes.

877
01:10:48,578 --> 01:10:49,829
Shoes.

878
01:10:49,913 --> 01:10:52,415
Your shoes. I know.

879
01:10:52,499 --> 01:10:53,833
There’s only one prize.

880
01:10:53,917 --> 01:10:55,293
I was nice.

881
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:00,924
FRANCIS:
Félicitation.

882
01:11:01,007 --> 01:11:03,468
You have made it
to the top five.

883
01:11:03,551 --> 01:11:06,262
The partner you are
paired with today has been

884
01:11:06,346 --> 01:11:08,473
carefully assigned
by Madame Brunelle

885
01:11:08,556 --> 01:11:11,434
to be your final partner
for the prize dance.

886
01:11:11,518 --> 01:11:16,564
Together you will choose an
excerpt from Romeo and Juliet.

887
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:25,240
What’s wrong?

888
01:11:25,323 --> 01:11:26,992
This is such bullshit.

889
01:11:27,075 --> 01:11:29,077
It’s like they want me to lose.

890
01:11:30,412 --> 01:11:32,163
We’re gonna figure it out.

891
01:11:33,623 --> 01:11:36,668
We’re not gonna let anything
or anyone come between us.

892
01:11:38,044 --> 01:11:40,171
We’re not gonna give up
on the pact.

893
01:11:40,255 --> 01:11:41,339
KATE:
I know.

894
01:11:41,423 --> 01:11:44,426
It’s just...
you wouldn’t understand.

895
01:11:46,011 --> 01:11:47,929
This is my one chance.

896
01:12:05,989 --> 01:12:07,282
Okay.

897
01:12:14,164 --> 01:12:16,166
-

898
01:12:21,796 --> 01:12:23,757
BRUNELLE: The prize dance
is on the horizon,

899
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:27,177
and nothing should
distract you from that.

900
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:29,262
However, it’s come
to my attention

901
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:33,767
that there is a good opportunity
for the right ballerina.

902
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:39,981
We are looking for an understudy
for Sarah.

903
01:12:40,065 --> 01:12:42,275
It is a more
contemporary project.

904
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:43,610
It would be...

905
01:12:43,693 --> 01:12:45,570
an honor to work...

906
01:12:45,653 --> 01:12:47,113
with you two.

907
01:12:48,156 --> 01:12:49,407
Good luck.

908
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:52,535
BRUNELLE:
Don’t be nervous.

909
01:12:52,619 --> 01:12:55,163
Just show us what you can do.

910
01:13:26,528 --> 01:13:28,196
BRUNELLE:
Virginia,

911
01:13:28,279 --> 01:13:31,366
let’s not waste any more
of Sarah and Benjamin’s time.

912
01:13:31,449 --> 01:13:33,201
Shall we?

913
01:14:09,362 --> 01:14:11,322
MARINE:
I’m happy they picked you.

914
01:14:12,365 --> 01:14:14,200
KATE:
You don’t seem happy.

915
01:14:14,284 --> 01:14:15,702
MARINE:
I am.

916
01:14:17,495 --> 01:14:19,581
You deserve it.

917
01:14:20,206 --> 01:14:21,708
Thanks.

918
01:14:21,791 --> 01:14:25,170
I mean, it’s not the prize, but
it’s still pretty cool, I guess.

919
01:14:25,253 --> 01:14:26,629
Where is your earring?

920
01:14:27,922 --> 01:14:29,924
KATE:
Oh, um...

921
01:14:30,008 --> 01:14:31,342
I don’t know.

922
01:14:31,426 --> 01:14:33,553
-It must’ve fallen out.
-

923
01:14:34,554 --> 01:14:35,680
I’ll give you another one.

924
01:14:35,763 --> 01:14:37,265
Oh, no, no, no,
don’t worry about it.

925
01:14:37,348 --> 01:14:39,267
Don’t worry,
it’s just a shiny rock.

926
01:14:40,935 --> 01:14:42,562
I don’t want another one.

927
01:14:51,196 --> 01:14:53,406
We need to talk.

928
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:55,533
-About the pact.
-Are you serious?

929
01:14:55,617 --> 01:14:58,161
-You don’t want to keep the pact
-

930
01:14:58,244 --> 01:14:59,537
now that you’re ranked
higher than me,

931
01:14:59,621 --> 01:15:01,164
but you were fine with it
when you were at the bottom.

932
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:02,457
It’s not about that.

933
01:15:04,542 --> 01:15:06,711
I’m just trying to be realistic.

934
01:15:06,794 --> 01:15:08,338
Since when?

935
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:10,173
You think you can
fuck your way to stardom

936
01:15:10,256 --> 01:15:12,550
and that’s gonna make you
high-class.

937
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:52,048
BENJAMIN:
Kate Sanders, you’re up.

938
01:16:48,813 --> 01:16:50,648
We need to rehearse.

939
01:18:22,198 --> 01:18:23,408
What did you expect?

940
01:18:25,952 --> 01:18:27,203
KATE:
It doesn’t matter.

941
01:18:27,286 --> 01:18:30,706
Benjamin’s gonna be a judge
at the final evaluation.

942
01:18:30,790 --> 01:18:32,667
-He knows what I can do.
-

943
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:34,085
It does matter.

944
01:18:34,168 --> 01:18:36,879
This is so unfair to me.

945
01:18:36,963 --> 01:18:38,548
-Did you think of this?
-

946
01:18:40,967 --> 01:18:43,094
KATE:
Luc’s refusing to dance with me.

947
01:18:43,177 --> 01:18:45,555
I can’t be expected to rehearse
for Benjamin’s project

948
01:18:45,638 --> 01:18:47,390
and the academy
at the same time.

949
01:18:47,473 --> 01:18:50,518
Well, that’s exactly
what you are expected to do.

950
01:18:50,601 --> 01:18:51,978
The understudy role doesn’t mean

951
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:54,397
that you’re gonna get
a contract...

952
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:55,648
or win the prize.

953
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:56,941
It doesn’t mean anything.

954
01:18:57,024 --> 01:18:59,235
You’ve never liked me.

955
01:18:59,318 --> 01:19:01,821
You have never given me
a real chance.

956
01:19:01,904 --> 01:19:03,614
Do you think I don’t see you?

957
01:19:04,866 --> 01:19:07,160
If I didn’t like you,
I’d just let you fail.

958
01:19:22,133 --> 01:19:24,552
-

959
01:19:31,017 --> 01:19:32,935
Oh, thank you.

960
01:19:33,019 --> 01:19:34,395
-You look great.

961
01:19:34,479 --> 01:19:36,397
-

962
01:19:36,481 --> 01:19:38,483
SARAH:
We are gathered here today

963
01:19:38,566 --> 01:19:43,571
to celebrate the birth
of this obscenely talented brat

964
01:19:43,654 --> 01:19:46,949
that I’m very proud to call
my collaborator and friend.

965
01:19:47,033 --> 01:19:49,368
Let’s be honest, Benjamin.

966
01:19:49,452 --> 01:19:53,080
This toast wouldn’t be possible
if not for all those rich people

967
01:19:53,164 --> 01:19:55,875
you convince
to empty their pockets

968
01:19:55,958 --> 01:19:58,044
for the sake of our art form.

969
01:19:58,127 --> 01:20:01,839
So, may you continue
to pander to their demands.

970
01:20:01,923 --> 01:20:03,883
-Long live Benjamin.

971
01:20:03,966 --> 01:20:06,177
-Long live ballet.
-Long live ballet.

972
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:07,470
Long live ballet.

973
01:20:07,553 --> 01:20:09,972
-OTHERS: Long live ballet!
-

974
01:20:14,977 --> 01:20:17,939
What did she mean by
"pander to their demands"?

975
01:20:18,022 --> 01:20:19,106
Hmm.

976
01:20:19,190 --> 01:20:21,484
She’s just poking fun at me,

977
01:20:21,567 --> 01:20:23,903
because it was a donor who
insisted that she would be cast

978
01:20:23,986 --> 01:20:26,364
at the beginning of her career.

979
01:20:26,447 --> 01:20:27,573
What do you mean?

980
01:20:27,657 --> 01:20:29,784
Well, they gave
a bunch of money to ballet

981
01:20:29,867 --> 01:20:32,912
so they could strongly suggest
their favorite to be cast.

982
01:20:33,996 --> 01:20:35,873
And you agreed to this?

983
01:20:35,957 --> 01:20:37,375
She was terrific.

984
01:20:39,377 --> 01:20:41,671
KATE:
But not the best?

985
01:20:41,754 --> 01:20:45,007
She became the best
with my guidance.

986
01:20:46,968 --> 01:20:49,720
-But...
-But what, ma chérie?

987
01:20:49,804 --> 01:20:51,639
It’s never been
an even playing field.

988
01:20:51,722 --> 01:20:55,851
It’s always been about
sex, blood, money.

989
01:20:55,935 --> 01:20:57,562
It’s all that matters.

990
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:26,317
SCOTT
Katie?

991
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:27,443
Are you okay?

992
01:22:27,526 --> 01:22:29,070
I need you to tell me the truth.

993
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:32,782
Why did you sell the house?

994
01:22:34,241 --> 01:22:36,118
They said...

995
01:22:36,202 --> 01:22:40,164
the Durand family had a change
of heart, whatever that means.

996
01:22:42,375 --> 01:22:44,794
The bastards
revoked your scholarship.

997
01:23:17,118 --> 01:23:18,744
What’s wrong?

998
01:23:28,462 --> 01:23:30,214
You’re scaring me.

999
01:23:32,299 --> 01:23:34,301
I know what you did.

1000
01:23:42,768 --> 01:23:44,478
You used me.

1001
01:23:47,273 --> 01:23:49,942
Made me think
we were actually friends.

1002
01:23:52,570 --> 01:23:55,114
And then you had
your parents intervene

1003
01:23:55,197 --> 01:23:58,242
to cancel my scholarship.

1004
01:23:58,325 --> 01:24:00,327
Why would you do that to me?

1005
01:24:01,579 --> 01:24:04,248
I-I s-- I swear, I didn’t...

1006
01:24:04,331 --> 01:24:05,791
I didn’t.

1007
01:24:06,834 --> 01:24:07,960
I didn’t know.

1008
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:10,171
You’re such a liar!

1009
01:24:15,551 --> 01:24:19,346
I swear on my life, I would
never purposely hurt you.

1010
01:24:20,389 --> 01:24:21,640
We’re best friends.

1011
01:24:21,724 --> 01:24:22,933
We’re sisters.

1012
01:24:23,017 --> 01:24:25,352
You would have a threesome
with your sister?

1013
01:24:28,022 --> 01:24:31,609
Oh, that’s right.
You probably would.

1014
01:24:34,653 --> 01:24:36,655
-

1015
01:24:49,919 --> 01:24:51,128
MARINE:
Kate!

1016
01:24:52,296 --> 01:24:53,756
Can we talk?

1017
01:24:55,841 --> 01:24:57,384
Please.

1018
01:25:28,541 --> 01:25:30,334
What’s going on?

1019
01:25:30,417 --> 01:25:31,460
LUC:
Is it true?

1020
01:25:32,503 --> 01:25:33,838
Is what true?

1021
01:25:35,214 --> 01:25:36,757
You and Ollie.

1022
01:25:38,217 --> 01:25:39,510
Everyone is saying that

1023
01:25:39,593 --> 01:25:41,095
your mother
caught you guys fucking,

1024
01:25:41,178 --> 01:25:43,222
and that’s why
he killed himself.

1025
01:25:47,059 --> 01:25:49,562
No, it’s not... it’s not true.

1026
01:25:51,522 --> 01:25:53,148
That’s not true.

1027
01:25:57,194 --> 01:26:00,030
-You know that’s not true.
-Don’t fucking touch me.

1028
01:26:01,615 --> 01:26:03,242
You disgust me.

1029
01:26:40,613 --> 01:26:42,156
Hi.

1030
01:27:55,854 --> 01:27:58,232
I was just
a few years older than you.

1031
01:28:00,234 --> 01:28:02,903
I was dancing Swan Lake.

1032
01:28:02,987 --> 01:28:04,405
Main stage.

1033
01:28:05,864 --> 01:28:08,742
One day, I noticed
that I was gaining weight.

1034
01:28:08,826 --> 01:28:10,828
It didn’t make any sense.

1035
01:28:14,248 --> 01:28:16,333
-What’d you do?
-Nothing.

1036
01:28:17,710 --> 01:28:19,670
I kept dancing.

1037
01:28:19,753 --> 01:28:22,548
Harder than I had before.

1038
01:28:22,631 --> 01:28:26,260
Whatever life was inside me
bled out a few weeks later.

1039
01:28:26,343 --> 01:28:29,763
You cannot change the past.

1040
01:28:34,852 --> 01:28:36,395
You cannot.

1041
01:28:42,359 --> 01:28:46,447
All you can do is
learn to accept your grief,

1042
01:28:46,530 --> 01:28:48,991
your shame,

1043
01:28:49,074 --> 01:28:50,909
your regret.

1044
01:28:52,870 --> 01:28:55,914
It’s a heavy rock
we carry around.

1045
01:28:55,998 --> 01:28:58,250
And one that we can
never put down.

1046
01:29:00,002 --> 01:29:01,211
But...

1047
01:29:03,005 --> 01:29:05,007
...I have learned...

1048
01:29:06,884 --> 01:29:08,886
...to love my rock.

1049
01:29:11,305 --> 01:29:13,807
Instead of...

1050
01:29:13,891 --> 01:29:15,893
of weighing me down...

1051
01:29:17,811 --> 01:29:19,813
...it’s made me stronger.

1052
01:29:33,494 --> 01:29:35,537
Blessed is she who falls.

1053
01:29:39,666 --> 01:29:43,212
Blessed is she who rises again.

1054
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:27,297
So you’re dancing a solo.

1055
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:30,425
Yes.

1056
01:30:30,509 --> 01:30:33,095
Madame Brunelle says, because
you decided to dance alone,

1057
01:30:33,178 --> 01:30:35,139
she’s reassigning Felipe to me.

1058
01:30:37,057 --> 01:30:39,059
Isn’t that what you wanted?

1059
01:31:07,588 --> 01:31:09,965
FRANCIS:
Welcome, friends,

1060
01:31:10,048 --> 01:31:11,633
family.

1061
01:31:11,717 --> 01:31:14,052
Thank you for being here
to witness

1062
01:31:14,136 --> 01:31:17,055
these ten extraordinary
young dancers...

1063
01:31:27,858 --> 01:31:32,696
...a contract with
the Paris Opera Ballet.

1064
01:31:32,779 --> 01:31:34,781
-Thank you.

1065
01:32:05,062 --> 01:32:09,274
just wants to break you

1066
01:32:10,901 --> 01:32:14,529
that look inside your eye

1067
01:32:16,531 --> 01:32:20,619
it only makes you stronger?

1068
01:32:22,329 --> 01:32:25,707
to run and hide

1069
01:32:27,626 --> 01:32:31,797
just wants to trick you

1070
01:32:33,382 --> 01:32:37,552
that look inside their eyes?

1071
01:32:39,012 --> 01:32:43,350
pain can make you stronger?

1072
01:32:45,018 --> 01:32:49,439
into their lies

1073
01:33:01,076 --> 01:33:02,744
-

1074
01:33:14,923 --> 01:33:19,469
the nights are getting longer

1075
01:33:20,846 --> 01:33:22,180
-

1076
01:33:26,351 --> 01:33:30,522
you’re only getting stronger

1077
01:33:32,065 --> 01:33:35,777
when they call.

1078
01:34:43,470 --> 01:34:45,013
-

1079
01:37:23,838 --> 01:37:25,298
That took courage.

1080
01:37:30,220 --> 01:37:32,514
I didn’t know you could
choreograph like that.

1081
01:37:35,225 --> 01:37:38,061
I would love to dance for you
one day.

1082
01:37:38,144 --> 01:37:40,188
It would be an honor.

1083
01:37:59,958 --> 01:38:02,377
Thank you for your patience,
everybody.

1084
01:38:05,046 --> 01:38:06,923
You have made me...

1085
01:38:07,007 --> 01:38:09,801
very proud, petits rats.

1086
01:38:09,884 --> 01:38:14,389
If I call your name, I will have
to ask you to leave the stage...

1087
01:38:15,682 --> 01:38:18,852
...and to pursue opportunities
elsewhere.

1088
01:38:20,645 --> 01:38:22,022
Natasha.

1089
01:38:26,818 --> 01:38:28,236
Peter.

1090
01:38:32,490 --> 01:38:33,908
Isabelle.

1091
01:38:37,454 --> 01:38:38,872
Jean Paul.

1092
01:38:42,292 --> 01:38:44,127
Roman.

1093
01:38:45,295 --> 01:38:46,713
Luc.

1094
01:38:52,969 --> 01:38:54,638
Felipe,

1095
01:38:54,721 --> 01:38:59,934
we award the prize
for best male dancer to you.

1096
01:39:06,691 --> 01:39:08,610
Congratulations.

1097
01:39:08,693 --> 01:39:10,195
Thank you.

1098
01:39:11,655 --> 01:39:14,199
BRUNELLE: And now
to our talented ballerinas,

1099
01:39:14,282 --> 01:39:17,744
a subject of much debate.

1100
01:39:17,827 --> 01:39:19,829
Gia.

1101
01:39:21,206 --> 01:39:22,832
You haven’t won the prize today.

1102
01:39:22,916 --> 01:39:24,668
But we would like to offer you

1103
01:39:24,751 --> 01:39:27,504
an apprenticeship
with the Paris Opera Ballet.

1104
01:39:32,217 --> 01:39:33,677
Merci.

1105
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:36,346
Bravo.

1106
01:39:49,442 --> 01:39:52,529
The time has come
for which ballerina

1107
01:39:52,612 --> 01:39:55,240
will win the prize.

1108
01:39:55,323 --> 01:40:01,162
The winner of the contract
for the Paris Opera Ballet is...

1109
01:40:07,377 --> 01:40:09,045
MARINE:
Wait.

1110
01:40:11,673 --> 01:40:13,007
I don’t want it.

1111
01:40:21,933 --> 01:40:23,351
What are you doing?

1112
01:40:24,394 --> 01:40:26,229
What about Ollie’s prize?

1113
01:40:27,397 --> 01:40:30,316
If you leave now,
you are on your own.

1114
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:32,736
You have no idea how to fend
for yourself in the real world.

1115
01:40:32,819 --> 01:40:34,487
You will be cut off.

1116
01:40:34,571 --> 01:40:36,114
Do you understand?

1117
01:40:36,197 --> 01:40:37,407
I do.

1118
01:40:38,616 --> 01:40:40,076
Marine!

1119
01:40:41,411 --> 01:40:44,414
BRUNELLE:
Mademoiselle Sanders,

1120
01:40:44,497 --> 01:40:48,877
the prize belongs to you.

1121
01:41:02,724 --> 01:41:04,893
Congratulations, Virginia.

1122
01:41:10,190 --> 01:41:12,192
I know you would have
picked her.

1123
01:41:13,818 --> 01:41:15,820
I saw you with her father.

1124
01:41:17,197 --> 01:41:19,574
I know he paid you to pick her.

1125
01:41:19,657 --> 01:41:21,367
The family revoked
your scholarship.

1126
01:41:21,451 --> 01:41:24,037
I was trying to reverse that.

1127
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:26,790
I picked the best dancer.

1128
01:41:28,792 --> 01:41:30,418
KATE:
So who was it?

1129
01:41:31,669 --> 01:41:33,922
Me or M?

1130
01:41:37,675 --> 01:41:38,885
Please.

1131
01:41:40,386 --> 01:41:42,138
I need to know.

1132
01:42:27,267 --> 01:42:28,476
Kate!

1133
01:42:31,187 --> 01:42:32,939
Hi.

1134
01:42:33,940 --> 01:42:36,401
I saw the show.

1135
01:42:37,443 --> 01:42:38,570
You were really good.

1136
01:42:39,612 --> 01:42:40,864
Thanks.

1137
01:42:44,993 --> 01:42:46,911
How are you?

1138
01:42:46,995 --> 01:42:48,413
Actually really good.

1139
01:42:49,831 --> 01:42:51,666
Great, even.

1140
01:42:54,043 --> 01:42:57,046
It took me a long time to be
able to say that, but, um...

1141
01:42:58,298 --> 01:43:00,174
...it’s true.

1142
01:43:00,258 --> 01:43:01,718
You still dancing?

1143
01:43:03,344 --> 01:43:05,346
Mostly at the Jungle.

1144
01:43:05,430 --> 01:43:08,349
That place still exists?

1145
01:43:08,433 --> 01:43:10,768
You should come by sometime
if you ever feel like it.

1146
01:43:10,852 --> 01:43:13,605
I just finished
choreographing this new piece.

1147
01:43:19,235 --> 01:43:21,237
I came by to say thank you.

1148
01:43:23,573 --> 01:43:25,491
For what?

1149
01:43:25,575 --> 01:43:28,161
You really forced me
to face myself.

1150
01:43:29,537 --> 01:43:31,581
And I feel free now.

1151
01:43:35,001 --> 01:43:37,462
I hope you find that, too.

1152
01:44:03,738 --> 01:44:04,989
Hey!

1153
01:44:05,073 --> 01:44:06,324
Hi.

1154
01:44:07,492 --> 01:44:09,786
-What the fuck was that?
-What do you mean?

1155
01:44:09,869 --> 01:44:12,747
What kind of fucked-up game
are you trying to play?

1156
01:44:12,830 --> 01:44:15,249
-I’m not...
-Bullshit!

1157
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:18,169
You should be mad at me!

1158
01:44:18,252 --> 01:44:19,671
You should fucking hate me!

1159
01:44:19,754 --> 01:44:21,756
Why don’t you hate me?

1160
01:44:30,765 --> 01:44:32,392
I’m sorry.

1161
01:44:36,980 --> 01:44:38,147
Sorry.

1162
01:44:45,905 --> 01:44:48,449
You have no idea

1163
01:44:48,533 --> 01:44:51,452
how much I wish
I could take back

1164
01:44:51,536 --> 01:44:54,956
everything that happened,
everything I did.

1165
01:44:57,625 --> 01:44:59,043
I’m sorry.

1166
01:45:05,008 --> 01:45:06,634
MARINE:
Virginia.

1167
01:45:11,848 --> 01:45:14,058
Blessed is she who falls.

1168
01:45:15,226 --> 01:45:17,729
Blessed is she who rises again.

1169
01:45:30,074 --> 01:45:32,285
MARINE:
The animals were behaving badly.

1170
01:45:39,834 --> 01:45:43,671
So the gods put a blanket over
the Earth to block out the sun.

1171
01:45:47,842 --> 01:45:49,886
Until one little bird
flew higher

1172
01:45:49,969 --> 01:45:52,388
than any bird
had ever flown before,

1173
01:45:52,472 --> 01:45:55,683
so high she poked a hole
in the blanket.

1174
01:47:02,959 --> 01:47:04,961
-

1175
01:47:23,437 --> 01:47:25,648
KATE:
The fall nearly broke her.

1176
01:47:27,024 --> 01:47:30,653
But she embraced the pain
she could no longer escape...

1177
01:47:32,029 --> 01:47:36,784
...and opened her heart
once more to the sky.

1178
01:48:30,379 --> 01:48:34,884
to be in love

1179
01:49:50,584 --> 01:49:56,507
what some people don’t

1180
01:49:56,590 --> 01:50:02,596
until they explode

1181
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:08,227
doesn’t seem to shine
