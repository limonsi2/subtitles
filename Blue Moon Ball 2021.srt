00:17:23,955 --> 00:17:25,826
- Save the blue moon ball.

361
00:17:25,827 --> 00:17:26,914
- Exactly!

362
00:17:26,915 --> 00:17:28,611
So...

363
00:17:28,612 --> 00:17:31,310
I'll see you around, I guess?

364
00:17:31,311 --> 00:17:32,311
- Maybe.

365
00:17:43,453 --> 00:17:44,801
Danny, hey.

366
00:17:44,802 --> 00:17:45,802
- Hey.

367
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:48,892
Can you come to my office?

368
00:17:48,893 --> 00:17:50,981
I want to talk about
the book signing.

369
00:17:50,982 --> 00:17:53,201
I heard through the grapevine
that after selling one book,

370
00:17:53,202 --> 00:17:55,073
you proceeded to pack up early.

371
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,335
Tell me the grapevine lies.

372
00:17:56,336 --> 00:17:57,336
- I did.

373
00:17:59,165 --> 00:18:00,774
You told me to go to the
place where I first fell in love,

374
00:18:00,775 --> 00:18:03,342
so I flew home last night.

375
00:18:03,343 --> 00:18:05,257
- Flew home?

376
00:18:05,258 --> 00:18:07,824
I was talking about in
your mind, not on a plane.

377
00:18:07,825 --> 00:18:09,652
- Oops.

378
00:18:09,653 --> 00:18:11,132
- Well, you're there
now, I suppose.

379
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:12,829
Getting lots of writing done?

380
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,830
- Tons!

381
00:18:14,658 --> 00:18:15,963
- Great.

382
00:18:15,964 --> 00:18:17,095
Send me the pages by Friday.

383
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,140
- Prepare to be amazed.

384
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:21,925
- You know, in this profession,
I prepare for the worst

385
00:18:21,926 --> 00:18:23,492
and I pray for slightly better.

386
00:18:23,493 --> 00:18:24,711
Bye, grace.

387
00:18:24,712 --> 00:18:25,495
[Hangs up phone]

388
00:18:25,495 --> 00:18:26,495
- By-

389
00:18:30,674 --> 00:18:32,501
- [contractor] Joe, come here!

390
00:18:32,502 --> 00:18:34,896
[Curious music]

391
00:18:43,905 --> 00:18:45,298
- [Heather] Sean!

392
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,780
- Hey, Heather.

393
00:18:50,781 --> 00:18:51,955
How was your day?

394
00:18:51,956 --> 00:18:53,654
- Oh, good as good can be.

395
00:18:55,308 --> 00:18:57,004
Spent most of it
at the riding club,

396
00:18:57,005 --> 00:18:59,049
practicing dressage with star.

397
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,660
I'm gonna need new gloves soon.

398
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:01,878
- My day was good too.

399
00:19:01,879 --> 00:19:03,793
Thanks for asking.

400
00:19:03,794 --> 00:19:05,882
- Somebody's grumpy.

401
00:19:05,883 --> 00:19:07,710
- I heard you've been
talking up the shopping mall,

402
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:09,756
which seems a little strange,

403
00:19:09,757 --> 00:19:13,716
given that it's my job to
make sure that doesn't happen.

404
00:19:13,717 --> 00:19:18,156
- It's your first job,
baby boo. A practice run.

405
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,636
Besides, you know how
proud my daddy's gonna be

406
00:19:20,637 --> 00:19:22,769
when you declare
that site a tear-down.

407
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,336
- Thanks for the
vote of confidence,

408
00:19:24,337 --> 00:19:27,252
but this mansion is
really important to me.

409
00:19:27,253 --> 00:19:30,864
It's a link to some of this
town's most important history.

410
00:19:30,865 --> 00:19:32,431
It's not a tear-down.

411
00:19:32,432 --> 00:19:34,781
- I love that you always
think with your heart,

412
00:19:34,782 --> 00:19:37,697
it's the perfect balance
to overly logical me,

413
00:19:37,698 --> 00:19:39,742
who has no choice
but to point out

414
00:19:39,743 --> 00:19:42,876
that old house hasn't been
used in who knows how long.

415
00:19:42,877 --> 00:19:45,052
It's a financial black hole.

416
00:19:45,053 --> 00:19:48,709
That's why the cassidys
are finally dropping it.

417
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:51,885
- You know, I
heard they're living

418
00:19:51,886 --> 00:19:52,929
in the suburbs
somewhere back east.

419
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:55,367
The suburbs! Poor things.

420
00:19:55,368 --> 00:19:57,238
People will come
shopping here every day

421
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:59,849
from all over the
county and beyond.

422
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:04,071
It'll increase our
town's economy tenfold.

423
00:20:04,072 --> 00:20:06,595
- You know, I didn't need
your dad to give me this job.

424
00:20:06,596 --> 00:20:08,858
I can stand on my own two feet.

425
00:20:08,859 --> 00:20:10,818
Of course you can, sweetie.

426
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:15,256
- You ever gonna
stay at your own place?

427
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:17,476
- Why would I do that, silly?

428
00:20:17,477 --> 00:20:20,436
I make this place
just barely livable.

429
00:20:21,742 --> 00:20:23,090
Dinner will be ready in fine

430
00:20:23,091 --> 00:20:27,050
[emotional orchestral music]

431
00:20:27,051 --> 00:20:28,748
- Well!

432
00:20:28,749 --> 00:20:30,097
If it isn't my goddaughter!

433
00:20:30,098 --> 00:20:31,838
- [Grace] Sheriff Carson.

434
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:33,840
- How are you doing,
sweetie? [Laughing]

435
00:20:33,841 --> 00:20:35,407
- When I heard you
were back in town,

436
00:20:35,408 --> 00:20:37,060
I decided to camp out
in your mom's kitchen.

437
00:20:37,061 --> 00:20:39,976
That way you have no
choice but to say howdy.

438
00:20:39,977 --> 00:20:41,891
- Camp out means eat the fridge.

439
00:20:41,892 --> 00:20:42,892
[Sheriff Carson laughs]

440
00:20:42,893 --> 00:20:44,503
- Best fridge in town.

441
00:20:44,504 --> 00:20:45,721
- Well, I'd never come
home without visiting

442
00:20:45,722 --> 00:20:47,724
the best storyteller in town.

443
00:20:50,988 --> 00:20:52,075
- Um...

444
00:20:52,076 --> 00:20:53,860
How did the writing go?

445
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:54,861
Did you manage
to stay incognito?

446
00:20:54,862 --> 00:20:55,645
[Grace scoffs]

447
00:20:55,646 --> 00:20:57,255
- As if.

448
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,299
I had to personally
introduce myself

449
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,040
as the great-great-granddaughter

450
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,868
of the man who helped
build that mansion

451
00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:04,566
to every demolition
contractor in the county.

452
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:06,176
- So you know.

453
00:21:06,177 --> 00:21:07,874
- [Grace] Why didn't you tell me

454
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,963
they were planning
to tear it down?

455
00:21:09,964 --> 00:21:11,834
- It's a tragedy, grace, not
one we have any power over.

456
00:21:11,835 --> 00:21:14,272
- And it's a reminder
that the blue moon ball

457
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,230
is not about fancy location.

458
00:21:16,231 --> 00:21:18,276
It's about bringing the
community together.

459
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,234
- So you're gonna host
the party in your backyard?

460
00:21:20,235 --> 00:21:22,367
- If it came to
that, in a heartbeat,

461
00:21:22,368 --> 00:21:24,978
and anyone in town
would do the same thing.

462
00:21:24,979 --> 00:21:26,676
- Yes, ma'am, all true.

463
00:21:29,244 --> 00:21:30,244
- Sean's trying to have
the mansion deemed

464
00:21:30,245 --> 00:21:31,855
as a historical site.

465
00:21:34,597 --> 00:21:35,598
- Right. Sean.

466
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,993
I was wondering when
your two paths would cross.

467
00:21:39,994 --> 00:21:41,647
- Do you think there's any
chance he'll manage to save it?

468
00:21:41,648 --> 00:21:43,039
- Well, Sean's a smart man.

469
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,954
The town's lucky to have him.

470
00:21:44,955 --> 00:21:47,174
That said, he's not
exactly the persuasive type.

471
00:21:47,175 --> 00:21:48,349
[Grace snorts]

472
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,133
- That's definitely true.

473
00:21:50,134 --> 00:21:51,005
He could never get
me to do anything.

474
00:21:51,006 --> 00:21:53,093
- Yes, I know that.

475
00:21:53,094 --> 00:21:55,965
You were always the ring
leader with the bright ideas.

476
00:21:55,966 --> 00:21:57,793
You know, I remember
the time you and Sean

477
00:21:57,794 --> 00:21:59,882
stole that fire hose

478
00:21:59,883 --> 00:22:01,101
and flooded out old man
Jeremiah's taxidermy shop.

479
00:22:01,102 --> 00:22:02,102
Woo hoo hoo hoo!

480
00:22:02,103 --> 00:22:03,756
He was hopping mad!

481
00:22:03,757 --> 00:22:05,453
- Don't encourage her.

482
00:22:05,454 --> 00:22:07,325
- Like two peas in
a pod of mischief.

483
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,805

496

- Hey!

497
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,401
- You'll never
guess where I'm at.

498
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:42,796
Back at the scene of the crime.

499
00:22:44,928 --> 00:22:46,668
Look, I know it's a
little bit late for brunch,

500
00:22:46,669 --> 00:22:49,062
but my work is taking me
out of the city tomorrow.

501
00:22:49,063 --> 00:22:51,064
So, if you're free tonight,

502
00:22:51,065 --> 00:22:52,892
maybe we could
squeeze in that date.

503
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:55,808
- I'm actually not
in la right now.

504
00:22:55,809 --> 00:22:58,811
I'm on a bit of a
work trip myself.

knew it was a long shot.

- Um...

507
00:23:04,165 --> 00:23:06,079
Weird question for you.
But I was just wondering,

508
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,561
how do you know when to
stop diagnosing a patient?

509
00:23:09,562 --> 00:23:12,390
Like, how do you know
when you're done testing them

510
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:15,436
and you can just treat
them for what you think it is?

511
00:23:15,437 --> 00:23:17,482
- There's no hard and fast rule.

512
00:23:17,483 --> 00:23:19,745
When I've exhausted all
the possibilities I can think of.

513
00:23:19,746 --> 00:23:21,617
Then I just trust my gut.

00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:08,926
- Okay, what were your
grandparents' names?

720
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,059
- Albert and Marjorie. Why?

721
00:32:12,495 --> 00:32:14,541
- Do you think this was them?

722
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:17,935
- There's only
one way to find out.

723
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:18,893
- They're still alive?

724
00:32:18,894 --> 00:32:20,589
- Grandpa Albert is.

725
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:22,591
Present's a little tricky,

726
00:32:22,592 --> 00:32:24,854
but the past he knows
like the back of his hand.

727
00:32:24,855 --> 00:32:27,553
- You up for a trip
down memory Lane?

728
00:32:27,554 --> 00:32:29,816
- On one condition.

729
00:32:29,817 --> 00:32:31,644
- Anything from
my partner in crime.

730
00:32:31,645 --> 00:32:33,472
- I get to drive Jess.

731
00:32:33,473 --> 00:32:36,432
[Energetic rock music]

732
00:32:38,608 --> 00:32:40,783
- I really appreciate
you doing this, grace,

733
00:32:40,784 --> 00:32:41,959
especially when you
have work of your own

734
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,396
you've got to get back to.

735
00:32:44,397 --> 00:32:46,702
- I wouldn't exactly
consider this work.

736
00:32:46,703 --> 00:32:47,703
- Lucky!

737
00:32:49,706 --> 00:32:51,838
I barely slept with all the
thoughts racing through my mind.

738
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:54,754
- I mean, there's really only
two ways we can go, right?

739
00:32:54,755 --> 00:32:56,582
- You're right.

740
00:32:56,583 --> 00:32:58,367
We save her or we don't.

741
00:33:01,675 --> 00:33:06,245
Hey, I'm really doing everything
I can to save the mansion.

742
00:33:08,203 --> 00:33:09,812
I know I screwed up and
disappointed you in the past,

743
00:33:09,813 --> 00:33:12,641
but I'll try not to let
that happen again.

744
00:33:12,642 --> 00:33:14,774
- Disappointed me?

745
00:33:14,775 --> 00:33:18,517
Sean, I sent you about
101 text messages,

746
00:33:18,518 --> 00:33:20,998
countless embarrassing
late-night voicemails,

747
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,869
and you couldn't so
much as call me back?

748
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,653
- But...

749
00:33:24,654 --> 00:33:26,438
You never came back!

750
00:33:26,439 --> 00:33:28,048
- I was chasing my
dreams to be a writer!

751
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:30,920
You said you wanted that for me.

752
00:33:30,921 --> 00:33:31,921
- And I did!

753
00:33:33,533 --> 00:33:35,012
- So I don't get it.

754
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,884
You're not making sense.

755
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,628
- I really screwed up, didn't I?

756
00:33:46,502 --> 00:33:47,633
[Truck turns off]

757
00:33:47,634 --> 00:33:48,938
[Grace sighs]

758
00:33:48,939 --> 00:33:49,983
- You did.

759
00:33:49,984 --> 00:33:52,595
[Upbeat clapping]

760
00:33:54,467 --> 00:33:55,424
Do you think it's
too late to fix it?

761
00:33:55,425 --> 00:33:56,946
- Fix it?

762
00:33:56,947 --> 00:33:58,296
- I still have the bolt, Sean.

763
00:33:58,297 --> 00:33:59,427
- Get down!

764
00:33:59,428 --> 00:34:00,950
- What?

765
00:34:00,951 --> 00:34:01,648
- Your hair!
There's a bug in it!

766
00:34:01,649 --> 00:34:02,691
Let me get it!

767
00:34:02,692 --> 00:34:03,302
- [Grace] There's a-

768
00:34:03,303 --> 00:34:04,998
ew!

769
00:34:04,999 --> 00:34:07,348
Ew, ew, ew! Get
it out, get it out!

770
00:34:07,349 --> 00:34:08,741
Did you get it?

771
00:34:08,742 --> 00:34:09,612
Sean!

772
00:34:09,613 --> 00:34:11,004
- Got it.

773
00:34:11,005 --> 00:34:12,527
- Let me see it!

774
00:34:12,528 --> 00:34:13,833
- I smashed it.

775
00:34:13,834 --> 00:34:14,877
Wait here.

776
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:16,489
I'm gonna get grandpa.

777
00:34:17,446 --> 00:34:18,446
- Yeah.

778
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,320
You go get grandpa.

779
00:34:23,017 --> 00:34:25,628
[Grace shrieks]

780
00:34:41,557 --> 00:34:43,080
- Hi, Mrs. Montague!

781
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,125
- Oh, well, Heather! Hello!

782
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:46,953
Did you jog all the way here?

783
00:34:46,954 --> 00:34:48,433
- Exercise keeps me focused.

784
00:34:48,434 --> 00:34:50,217
- I love the determination.

785
00:34:50,218 --> 00:34:51,784
What brings you out to the area?

786
00:34:51,785 --> 00:34:54,091
- Well, it's a town-wide survey,

787
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,005
I want to know exactly
what kind of stores

788
00:34:56,006 --> 00:34:58,138
this town wants to
see in the new mall.

789
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:02,795
A new tech shop, a trendy
cafe, arts boutiques, you name it.

790
00:35:02,796 --> 00:35:04,623
- I'm very sorry, Heather.

791
00:35:04,624 --> 00:35:06,668
I just don't think it's
right I take the survey.

792
00:35:06,669 --> 00:35:10,063
Grace and I are dead set
against the mansion demolition.

793
00:35:10,064 --> 00:35:11,891
- Well, that's all
right. [Chuckles]

794
00:35:11,892 --> 00:35:14,372
You have a great
day, Mrs. Montague.

795
00:35:14,373 --> 00:35:15,373
- You too.

796
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:19,377
- Mrs. Montague?

797
00:35:19,378 --> 00:35:21,335
- Yes, dear?

798
00:35:21,336 --> 00:35:24,687
- Grace is really lucky to
have such a supportive mom.

799
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:27,515
- [Sean] How are you feeling?

800
00:35:27,516 --> 00:35:29,038
How they treating you in there?

801
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:30,692
- Well, I can't
complain, you know.

802
00:35:30,693 --> 00:35:32,738
I mean, I started
out with nothing,

803
00:35:32,739 --> 00:35:34,870
and I still have
most of it left.

804
00:35:34,871 --> 00:35:37,003
[Both laugh]

805
00:35:37,004 --> 00:35:37,918
- [Sean] You're doing
great. I mean, look at you.

806
00:35:37,919 --> 00:35:39,745
- Well, you know.

807
00:35:39,746 --> 00:35:40,876
- Grandpa Albert,
this is the friend

808
00:35:40,877 --> 00:35:41,964
I was telling you about, grace.

809
00:35:41,965 --> 00:35:43,401
- [Grandpa] Who? Speak up.

810
00:35:43,402 --> 00:35:44,054
- Grace!

811
00:35:44,055 --> 00:35:45,403
- Eh?

812
00:35:45,404 --> 00:35:46,752
- Oh!

813
00:35:46,753 --> 00:35:47,971
Marjorie, my dear!

814
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,278
Let's go to the races!

815
00:35:51,279 --> 00:35:53,759
- Grandpa Albert, that's
not Marjorie. She's-

816
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,500
- at the riding club.

817
00:35:55,501 --> 00:35:58,285
- Oh, at the riding club?

818
00:35:58,286 --> 00:36:00,461
- Well, of course
she is. [Laughs]

819
00:36:00,462 --> 00:36:01,941
I'm sorry, dear.

820
00:36:01,942 --> 00:36:03,769
My mistake.

821
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:04,684
- I guess the green
family loving me

822
00:36:04,685 --> 00:36:06,163
must be a genetic trait.

823
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,121
[Grandpa chuckles]

824
00:36:08,122 --> 00:36:09,905
- Taxi driver...

825
00:36:09,906 --> 00:36:12,952
Take me to the mansion gardens!

826
00:36:12,953 --> 00:36:16,564
I haven't seen a
blooming lilac in years.

827
00:36:16,565 --> 00:36:17,565
- Yes, sir.

828
00:36:22,745 --> 00:36:26,183
- [Grandpa] Oh, what
a time to be alive.

829
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,315
- Grandpa?
- Eh?

830
00:36:28,316 --> 00:36:31,144
- I wanted to ask you
about the blue moon ball.

831
00:36:31,145 --> 00:36:32,580
Do you remember it?

832
00:36:32,581 --> 00:36:34,757
- Well, of course I remember it!

833
00:36:37,064 --> 00:36:41,329
Dancing under the blue moon
is how every man in this town

834
00:36:42,678 --> 00:36:44,244
found the love of his life,

835
00:36:44,245 --> 00:36:46,682
glowing under Luna's soft kiss.

836
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:51,599
- That's beautiful.

837
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,166
Is that how you met Marjorie?

838
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:55,474
- Oh, no, no, we
grew up together.

839
00:36:57,345 --> 00:36:59,259
We were in the same class

840
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:02,742
all the way from kindergarten
through graduation.

841
00:37:04,526 --> 00:37:05,571
- Just like us.

842
00:37:07,442 --> 00:37:09,791
- Albert, we were
wondering about the mansion.

843
00:37:09,792 --> 00:37:11,315
We found some carved initials,
and we were just wondering

844
00:37:11,316 --> 00:37:13,795
if they had any
sort of significance.

845
00:37:13,796 --> 00:37:15,623
- Significance?

846
00:37:15,624 --> 00:37:16,885
[Scoffs]

847
00:37:16,886 --> 00:37:18,974
It's a tradition!

848
00:37:18,975 --> 00:37:21,413
As old as the blue moon itself.

849
00:37:23,415 --> 00:37:26,722
Legend had it that if a young
man would carve his name

850
00:37:28,507 --> 00:37:31,161
next to the name of
the woman he loved,

851
00:37:32,902 --> 00:37:34,947
they would be
brought together again

852
00:37:34,948 --> 00:37:36,819
under the next blue moon,

853
00:37:38,168 --> 00:37:39,778
and the moon would see to it,

854
00:37:39,779 --> 00:37:41,823
no matter what
the circumstances,

855
00:37:41,824 --> 00:37:45,698
that their paths would
cross and their love blossom.

856
00:37:46,873 --> 00:37:48,743
- Does it work?

857
00:37:48,744 --> 00:37:50,789
- Ask Marjorie.

858
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:52,922
We've been married since 1960.

859
00:37:55,229 --> 00:37:57,186
Why are you asking
all these questions

860
00:37:57,187 --> 00:37:59,668
about the blue moon ball anyway?

861
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,149
- Grandpa Albert...

862
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:07,719
There are some people who
want to tear the mansion down.

863
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,547
Me and grace,
we're trying to gather

864
00:38:09,548 --> 00:38:12,637
as much information as we
can to stop that from happening.

865
00:38:12,638 --> 00:38:13,900
- That's criminal!

866
00:38:16,206 --> 00:38:18,556
[Grandpa groaning]

867
00:38:18,557 --> 00:38:19,644
- Grandpa!

868
00:38:19,645 --> 00:38:21,036
Where are you going?

869
00:38:21,037 --> 00:38:22,037
- The study!

870
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,301
- There's a study?

871
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,825
- Not that I know of.

872
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,351
- [Sean] Grandpa,
where are you going?

873
00:38:31,352 --> 00:38:32,440
- You'll see.

874
00:38:35,225 --> 00:38:38,011
[Grandpa chuckles]

875
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,841
Prepare to be amazed.

876
00:38:52,982 --> 00:38:54,854
- [Grace] Nice work, Sean.

877
00:38:55,942 --> 00:38:57,290
- That's a boy.

878
00:38:57,291 --> 00:38:58,553
Ah, here we go.

879
00:39:01,774 --> 00:39:03,123
Whoa-ho, here it is.

880
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:09,433
- Is this an original
map of our town?

881
00:39:09,434 --> 00:39:11,826
- [Grandpa] Uh-huh.

882
00:39:11,827 --> 00:39:12,654
- It can't be.

883
00:39:12,655 --> 00:39:14,220
The year's 1831.

884
00:39:14,221 --> 00:39:16,309
We weren't found until 1845.

885
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:18,442
- That's right.

886
00:39:18,443 --> 00:39:21,880
The original founder of
this land, Austin Hastings,

887
00:39:21,881 --> 00:39:24,796
bought over 10,000 acres

888
00:39:24,797 --> 00:39:28,495
and built this
mansion for his wife.

889
00:39:28,496 --> 00:39:31,933
They knew they had
something special here,

890
00:39:31,934 --> 00:39:33,979
so they started
giving land deeds

891
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:36,373
to some of the
struggling local farmers

892
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,940
to foster a community.

893
00:39:38,941 --> 00:39:42,641
He envisioned a town,
and this is what it became.

894
00:39:45,426 --> 00:39:48,646
- Enough to have to have
it declared a historic site?

895
00:39:48,647 --> 00:39:51,039
- I mean, if we can
find the original deeds,

896
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,867
I don't see why not.

897
00:39:52,868 --> 00:39:56,044
- Find 'em? [Chuckles]

898
00:39:56,045 --> 00:39:58,960
My grandpa used to bring
me here to the mansion

when I was a child
for history lessons.

900

Now, Mr. Hastings kept
every document he ever had

901
00:40:06,926 --> 00:40:08,710
right here in this desk.

00:40:11,017 --> 00:40:12,017

- Look, we're all here. The
montagues, the Greens.

905
00:40:20,287 --> 00:40:22,462
- As a gesture of appreciation,

906

the local farmers built
Mr. Hastings the red barn.

907
00:40:31,211 --> 00:40:32,212
- Grace, I...

908
00:40:34,344 --> 00:40:36,171
I wanna ask you something.

909

- Yeah?

910
00:40:38,218 --> 00:40:39,785
- It's kinda awkward.

911
00:40:42,483 --> 00:40:44,136
I'm more just
asking for a friend.

912
00:40:44,137 --> 00:40:46,269
Oh, well, yeah, let's hear it.

913
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:52,057
- He has this girlfriend...

914
00:40:52,058 --> 00:40:55,104
And she was supposed
to be just a rebound

915
00:40:57,193 --> 00:41:00,587
to help him get over the
biggest heartbreak of his life.

916
00:41:00,588 --> 00:41:03,156
But that rebound
turned out to be

917
00:41:04,853 --> 00:41:08,160
more permanent than he expected.

918
00:41:08,161 --> 00:41:11,555
And he's been trying to break
up with her for months now,

919
00:41:11,556 --> 00:41:15,081
but he doesn't want to
hurt anyone's feelings.

920
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,998
- Us girls are
tougher than we look.

921
00:41:19,999 --> 00:41:21,608
You should just
be honest with her.

crossed paths with her.

but I'd sooner take a
pothole over a ticket.

934

problem with the mansion

there every night,
