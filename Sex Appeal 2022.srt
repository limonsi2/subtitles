1002

- There's a common misconception
that most women climax
from penetrative sex,

1003
00:46:29,958 --> 00:46:31,958
but statistics show
that 75% of women

1004
00:46:31,958 --> 00:46:33,958
can't achieve orgasm
from penetration alone.

1005
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:37,125
Stimulating the clitoris
and other erogenous zones is key.

1006
00:46:37,125 --> 00:46:38,208
- Damn.

1007
00:46:38,208 --> 00:46:40,333
- And how does one locate said e-zones?

1008
00:46:40,333 --> 00:46:43,792
- My cousin said that it's best to think
of your body like a game of Twister

1009
00:46:43,792 --> 00:46:45,708

You're trying
all these different samples, right?

00:46:51,083 --> 00:46:54,292
You're trying all these different samples.
Oop! Uh-oh. You found the one.

1013
00:46:54,292 --> 00:46:56,750

are the sample booths located?

1014
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:58,833
- Avery, I cannot tell you everything.
Jesus.

1015
00:46:58,833 --> 00:47:01,583
- If I may, the G depends
largely on the individual,

1016
00:47:01,583 --> 00:47:03,500
but there are a certain number
of other erogenous zones

1017
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,792
that occur across genders
and sexual preferences,

1018
00:47:05,792 --> 00:47:09,208

behind the knees, elbows.

1024
00:47:19,458 --> 00:47:21,875

00:47:21,875 --> 00:47:22,875
- I can orgasm.

1026
00:47:24,417 --> 00:47:26,167
Right here, right now.

1027
00:47:29,542 --> 00:47:31,792
- If I did that, I'd be suspended.

1028
00:47:31,792 --> 00:47:33,125
I would be suspended!

1029
00:47:33,125 --> 00:47:36,625
- Oh, my God, Troy, you so will be.
Okay, just take it down or take it out.

1030
00:47:36,625 --> 00:47:38,375
- Uh, Ms. Russell?
- Yeah, baby.

1031
00:47:38,375 --> 00:47:39,875
- Hi, mama. Uh...

1032
00:47:39,875 --> 00:47:41,625
Let's say Avery needs to solve for C.

1033
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:43,792
- Ooh, participation! Yes!
[snaps fingers]

1034
00:47:43,792 --> 00:47:45,500
- But doesn't Avery also need
to solve for G?

1035
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,083
Isn't G the super proof?

1036
00:47:47,083 --> 00:47:48,750
- But to solve for C and G,

1037
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:50,875
should she maybe also solve for A too?

1038
00:47:50,875 --> 00:47:52,083
- Ooh!
- Whoa, whoa!

1039
00:47:52,083 --> 00:47:54,333
- Excuse me, some of us
like to solve for A.

1040
00:47:54,333 --> 00:47:56,708
- Oh, for sure, A is great, guys.

1041
00:47:56,708 --> 00:47:58,875
- I love you, Ms. Russell.
Everyone loves a pinkie.

1042
00:47:59,958 --> 00:48:02,417
Everybody.
- What about B squared?

1043
00:48:02,417 --> 00:48:04,250
- Oh, my God, loves B squared,

1044
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:06,417
but we save that for our boy quadratic

1045
00:48:06,417 --> 00:48:09,000
when B squared is on top of 2A.

1046
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,542
- Yeah, she is!

1047
00:48:10,542 --> 00:48:12,917
- You know, I do really love
the triangle angle sum theorem,

1048
00:48:12,917 --> 00:48:15,333
because we get
the all-powerful isosceles.

1049
00:48:15,333 --> 00:48:16,875
- Mm, preach!

1050
00:48:18,125 --> 00:48:19,500
- Ooh!
MS. RUSSELL: Avery.

1051
00:48:20,083 --> 00:48:23,542
- Let's say movement occurs
at the intersection of the angles.

1052
00:48:24,333 --> 00:48:26,125
How would we solve for G?

1053
00:48:26,125 --> 00:48:28,375
- We're talking magnitude, huh? Okay.

1054
00:48:28,958 --> 00:48:32,917
We're going to need a vector that
starts at D and goes deep into G.

1055
00:48:32,917 --> 00:48:33,833
- Yeah, we do.

1056
00:48:33,833 --> 00:48:36,083
- Now, it doesn't matter how big
this vector is or how long,

1057
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:37,375
what matters is the angle, okay?

1058
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,500
MARLA: The angle!

1059
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,375
- Marla? You good there, boo?
STUDENT: She's really doing it.

1060
00:48:41,375 --> 00:48:43,583
MARLA: Yes, yes...

1061
00:48:43,583 --> 00:48:45,167
Yes!

1062
00:48:45,167 --> 00:48:46,708
Yes!

1063
00:48:46,708 --> 00:48:48,208
Yes!

1064

1073
00:49:12,625 --> 00:49:14,875

- Uh-huh.

1074
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:16,958

00:49:24,958 --> 00:49:27,417
Uh, I'll see you in band. There you go.

1080
00:49:27,417 --> 00:49:29,333
- Okay, thank you.
- Yeah, bye.

1081
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:31,792
- Hey, I--
- No.

1082
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:35,875
- I can't believe I didn't figure it out,
you know.

1083
00:49:35,875 --> 00:49:38,250
It's the chemistry plus the geometry.

1084
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:40,292
You solve for G,
you trigger a dopamine receptor

1085
00:49:40,292 --> 00:49:42,333
so then the dopamine floods your body
in chemical ecstasy.

1086
00:49:42,333 --> 00:49:45,375
Marla can do it. She did it in class.
You should have seen it.

1087
00:49:45,375 --> 00:49:46,917
But I'm not that skilled.

1088
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:49,208
- That's okay, I think I get
what you're saying.

1089
00:49:49,208 --> 00:49:52,500
But you know how it's always more
satisfying if someone else rubs your feet?

1090

01:13:17,833 --> 01:13:21,542

Tell her to name her feelings and...
