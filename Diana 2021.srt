can relate to that scenario.

1693
01:30:55,458 --> 01:30:58,041
Now, how much of the book is true?

1694
01:30:58,625 --> 01:31:00,375
And how am I supposed to answer that?

1695
01:31:00,458 --> 01:31:03,708
For a refreshing change,
let's try honestly.

1696
01:31:04,541 --> 01:31:07,083
Well, I've only seen
excerpts in the paper, but…

1697
01:31:07,583 --> 01:31:09,250
seems to be not untrue.

1698
01:31:09,333 --> 01:31:11,750
-Oh, for God's sake!
-Mummy, Mrs. Parker Bowles--

1699
01:31:11,833 --> 01:31:13,916
-I don't want to hear it!
-She is quite wonderful--

1700
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,666
I don't care if she's Joan of Arc!

1701
01:31:15,750 --> 01:31:17,750
-If you'd spend time with her--
-Absolutely not!

1702
01:31:17,875 --> 01:31:20,791
If I was interested
in this type of sordid drama,

1703
01:31:20,875 --> 01:31:23,291
I'd turn on Coronation Street.

1704
01:31:23,375 --> 01:31:26,583
Now, get on with it, Charles,
and mend your marriage.

1705
01:31:26,666 --> 01:31:28,791
For your children and for your country.

1706
01:31:29,333 --> 01:31:31,833
And maybe even for your mother.

1707
01:31:33,083 --> 01:31:34,541
And if I simply can't?

1708
01:31:35,291 --> 01:31:37,041
That's not an option.

1710
01:31:40,208 --> 01:31:44,375
She said that? Your mother
truly has no interest in meeting me?

1711
01:31:44,875 --> 01:31:46,083
After that book?

1712
01:31:46,166 --> 01:31:48,291
After Diana's been
dominating the airwaves?

1713
01:31:48,375 --> 01:31:50,500
I'm sorry, Charles,
but the Queen has gone mad.

1714
01:31:50,583 --> 01:31:52,875
Darling, I could use
a moment's quiet right now.

1715
01:31:52,958 --> 01:31:55,250
How can you be
so calm at a time like this?

1716
01:31:55,333 --> 01:31:57,083
Well, I need to finish this landscape.

1717
01:31:57,166 --> 01:31:59,666
-It's going to be on a stamp.
-Let me see it.

1718
01:32:02,708 --> 01:32:04,083
It's not one of your best.

1719
01:32:04,166 --> 01:32:06,750
Perhaps because it's been
rather difficult to concentrate!

1720
01:32:07,375 --> 01:32:09,083
She has no sense of propriety.

1721
01:32:09,166 --> 01:32:10,916
No sense of what should
and shouldn't be said.

1722
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,333
Exactly!

1723
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:16,208
So we must convince the press
to begin seeing this through our eyes.

1724
01:32:16,291 --> 01:32:19,041
She is out there
making a fool of you, and me.

1725
01:32:19,125 --> 01:32:21,250
And demeaning the monarchy in the process.

1728
01:32:28,083 --> 01:32:30,583
Well, there is one thing
I've been considering.

1729
01:32:31,166 --> 01:32:32,583
But it's rather drastic.

1730
01:32:33,083 --> 01:32:35,625
At this juncture,
we could use a bit of drastic.

1731
01:32:35,708 --> 01:32:36,583
What if…

1732
01:32:37,708 --> 01:32:39,541
Well, what if I went on television?

1733
01:32:39,625 --> 01:32:42,250
And owned up to the truth, told my story?

1734
01:32:42,333 --> 01:32:43,166
No.

1736

No Windsor has ever admitted
to having a mistress before,

1737

but I could speak to the nation,
