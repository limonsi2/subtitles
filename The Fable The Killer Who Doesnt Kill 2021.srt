3
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,686
Get your hands off me!

4
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:05,940
Let go of me! Let me go!

5
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:10,320
-Get off me!
-I'll fucking kill you! Bitch!

6
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:36,596
Killed? Who was it?

7
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,015
Get down, Koro. What?

8
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,355
He was shot?

9
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,483
By who?

10
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:51,986
What do you mean you don't know?

11
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,279
Find it out!

12
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,781
Hello?

13
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,373
Koro, come here.

14
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,935
Hey! Come on, man!

15
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:25,895
Don't you get it?

16
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,982
Someone's after us.
This is no joke! What will we do?

17
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,110
Hightail it? Where the hell to?

18
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,863
Call me if anything…

19
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:37,866
I'll call you back.

20
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:56,426
Seriously, the next place is great!
Come on! Let's go!

21
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,163
They're totally after us!

22
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,248
What?

23
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,585
Nozoe and Yamamoto too? Holy shit!

24
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,462
What about you?

25
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,841
Okay. I'll lie low for a while too.

26
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,169
Oh, my god! What happened? Oh, dear!

27
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,631
Hello? Police?

28
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,592
There's been an accident.
Yes, an accident.

29
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:31,224
<i>Children are the treasures of the country.</i>

30
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:35,895
We must remove the stones that could
trip them up and cause them to stumble.

31
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:40,024
That is our duty as adults.

32
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,735
The big protect the small.

33
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:46,906
This is something
that's ingrained deeply in our DNA.

34
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,953
When you hear DNA,
it's so much more believable, right?

35
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:58,960
When she was five, she fell
from the playground equipment in a park.

36
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,629
She became paralyzed from the waist down.

37
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,423
She fell three meters high.

38
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,759
There was insufficient railing.

39
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:12,682
I do this work to prevent
this kind of tragedy from happening again.

40
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,810
I want to work with all of you

41
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,772
to build a society where our children
can live in safety and security.

42
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:23,776
-Thank you for coming.
-Thank you.

43
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,697
-Thank you for coming.
-Thank you.

44
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,075
-Thank you.
-Thank you for coming.

45
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:35,830
Mr. Utsubo.
Your talk was fantastic again this time.

46
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,832
I found it so worthwhile.

47
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:40,501
I'll be inspecting parks this weekend
with the mayor.

48
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,211
-I'll report again after that.
-Yes.

49
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,051
Hi!

50
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,638
What did you think? Was it interesting?

51
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,307
Did you like it?

52
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,146
Oh, you!

53
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:03,107
She said she enjoyed it.
She played games on her mother's phone.

54
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,319
-Kids sure are honest.
-I'm so sorry.

55
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:08,905
Here.

56
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:16,579
-You know sign language too, I see.
-Yes.

57
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,707
I want to hear everyone's ideas.

58
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,350
You surely squawk a lot, chicken.

59
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,186
What are you squawking about?

60
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:44,148
Help me!

61
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:52,156
Cars. Trips. Beauty treatments.
Hair removal.

62
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,826
What's worse, orgies and even rape.

63
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,205
You squandered your parents' money.

64
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,083
You had a nice life.

65
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:13,886
Cluck, cluck. Cluck, cluck.

66
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:18,808
Cluck, cluck. Cluck, cluck.

67
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:23,312
Cluck, cluck. Cluck, cluck.

68
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,357
Why do you keep calling him a chicken?

69
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:31,821
His overprotective parents raised him
so carefully, like a baby chick,

70
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,407
so now, he's become a chicken.

71
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,117
I see.

72
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:41,414
Normally, since the world is dangerous,
we learn how not to get hurt.

73
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:45,876
But the more deeply engrossed you are
in disgusting behavior,

74
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,504
the more vainer become.

75
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:53,134
Is that really something
a bad guy should say?

76
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:58,264
The ones who speak the truth
are always adversaries and evil.

77
00:09:58,347 --> 00:09:59,599
Oh, really?

78
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:03,436
So, how much
did you scam his parents out of?

79
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,355
Twenty million. I know they'll pay for it.

80
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,441
I'll make it look like

81
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:12,486
he used the money to go on a trip
of self-discovery in Southeast Asia.

82
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:14,655
Forever.

83
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,328
Don't worry. It'll be over in a second.

84
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:29,503
Good medicine, as you know,
becomes a poison if you're given too much.

85
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,566
Overprotectiveness is good.

86
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:56,155
It makes for great business.

87
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,638
This is our new employee, Isaki.

88
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,433
I'm Isaki.
I look forward to working with you.

89
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:26,644
This is…

90
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:28,813
Suzuki.

91
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,857
Weren't you the guy operating
the backhoe earlier?

92
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,653
He may not look it,
but he's older than you, Isaki.

93
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:38,239
Seriously? Did you get plastic surgery?

94
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:42,284
And this is Hinako.

95
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,829
What a pity. You're such a beauty!

96
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,332
How do you shower? Or use the toilet?

97
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,668
-Or have sex?
-Hey!

98
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:52,837
Enough of that.

99
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,923
Sorry.

100
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,134
Teamwork is important.

101
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,511
Solidarity among us four is key.

102
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,682
The Beatles. Queen. Sex Pistols.

103
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,769
All these creators of great songs
were four-person teams.

104
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,108
They're all so old. From your era, right?

105
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,030
Maybe.

106
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,161
Okay, let's drink to the four of us.

107
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,372
Cheers.

108
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:35,254
That Isaki guy, can you trust him?

109
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,924
The question is if I can use him.

110
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,844
If he gets in the way,
we'll get rid of him.

111
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:52,313
He's an ex-employee of Maguro Company.

112
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,817
What do you mean by that?

113
00:12:57,776 --> 00:13:00,029
Do you know the hit man, Fable?

114
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:02,072
He's just an urban legend.

115
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,575
What if he was real?

116
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:10,456
Fable is apparently involved
with Maguro Company.

117
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,292
That's another reason I hired Isaki.

118
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:15,503
Fable.

119
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,380
That means "myth."

120
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:23,177
<i>He's called that
because he always kills his targets.</i>

121
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:27,264
But there's someone
who has survived from him.

122
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:33,896
Me.

123
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,942
-You saw him?
-Of course not.

124
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:39,985
He's Fable, you know.

125
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,242
Anyway, do you know anything about him?

126
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,829
He'll kill anyone in six seconds.

127
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,458
A manual ejecting pistol
that's like a toy.

128
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,628
Bullets that aren't lethal.

129
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:00,881
I only know what everyone else does.

130
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,676
Truly a myth.

131
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:09,473
Actually, he's unexpectedly nearby.

132
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,394
Kind of like Murphy's Law.

133
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:19,024
<i>Be my… girlfriend!</i>

134
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,651
<i>No way!</i>

135
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,575
<i>You're from Tochigi, aren't you, Ai?</i>

136
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:28,826
<i>Yes. So?</i>

137
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,579
<i>If you become my girlfriend,</i>

138
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:37,918
<i>then I'll have made girlfriends
from all 47 prefectures in Japan!</i>

139
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,797
-You're so passionate, Jackal.
<i>-I'm begging you!</i>

140
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,634
<i>Be my girlfriend!</i>

141
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,555
<i>I love you!</i>

142
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:56,103
<i>Success!</i>

143
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,647
<i>A WEEKDAY NAMED LOVE</i>
TO BE CONTINUED

144
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,625
<i>Misaki.</i>

145
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,503
<i>As the boss, I must tell you the truth.</i>

146
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:23,964
You know…

147
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,593
your hairstyle looks beautiful!

148
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:30,095
You think so? I'm so happy to hear that!

149
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,641
Of course, your long hair was nice too.

150
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:37,186
But this short hair,
it's so, like, wow! Brilliant!

151
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,980
Wait! It's so bright! It's like the sun!

152
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,942
Boss! You're being far too flattering.

153
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,069
Oh! You changed your style, Misaki?

154
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,113
-You look great.
-Thank you.

155
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,157
Well, well.

156
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,411
Good morning.

157
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,124
Sato!

158
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,419
Look at Misaki, would you? Look at her!

159
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,715
Come on, tell her honestly what you think.

160
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,092
Very red.

161
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,094
-What?
-What did you say?

162
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,763
My clothes?

163
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,723
My sweater?

164
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,767
-That's right.
-Well…

165
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:21,021
Yes, I'll admit it's red. But what else?

166
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,067
Your skirt is white.

167
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,695
-Yes…
-Can't you see it?

168
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:31,365
What are you even looking at?
That's not it. Her hair!

169
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,282
Her hair?

170
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,415
It's black.

171
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,083
That's my natural color.

172
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,876
Are you even listening to me?

173
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,587
The same color
as the Brazilian coral snake.

174
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,172
-Bra…
-A snake?

175
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,341
-A very beautiful and venomous snake.
-Venomous?

176
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:54,054
-A venomous snake?
-Sato, why don't you go make a delivery?

177
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,557
What are you looking at? Quit spacing out!

178
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,768
Go and deliver this, Sato. Now! Get going!

179
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,729
It's incredibly urgent! Get going!

180
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:05,816
Oh, right!
Misaki, we got an order for some flyers.

181
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:09,945
It's a non-profit organization
that helps children. See?

182
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:14,283
I ordered the flyers
for next month's lecture.

183
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,242
Thanks.

184
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:22,291
The Internet is filled with dangers.
We need to protect the children from them.

185
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,172
-Hello. Excuse me.
-Hello. Oh, I'm sorry.

186
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,426
-And…
-Yes? What is it?

187
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,471
Fire that Isaki guy.

188
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,139
He's creepy.

189
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:41,435
It's not that easy to do.
I need people to do this work.

190
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,774
However,

191
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:50,319
if you absolutely can't stand him,

192
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,821
I'll think about it.

193
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:59,078
We must respect the opinions
of youngsters with a future.

194
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:03,791
A future?

195
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,923
I don't have any.

196
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:12,633
Hinako.

197
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,679
Some people who can't walk…

198
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,226
live perfectly fulfilling lives.

199
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:32,402
Excuse me.

200
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:35,072
Oh, go ahead.

201
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:38,033
-Thank you.
-Oh, my! How cute!

202
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,743
-How old?
-Eight months.

203
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,955
Only eight months?
She must still keep you busy.

204
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,623
It's 70 centimeters.

205
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,335
It should be 110. You see, kids,

206
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,753
they'll look over it.

207
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,589
-I see.
-And if they lean farther, they'll fall!

208
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:56,593
-That's dangerous.
-And this pond, just look at the color.

209
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,596
Even if someone saw it,
they may not be able to save them.

210
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:04,017
It might be better
just to get rid of the whole thing.

211
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:46,536
What do you want?

212
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,626
Nothing. I was thinking you would fall.

213
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:56,755
If you were watching,
normally you'd catch me before I fell.

214
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,550
I didn't want to interfere
while you were trying so hard.

215
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:02,678
That's ridiculous.

216
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,681
-Okay, then I'll help you.
-No thanks.

217
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:22,948
Does this amuse you?

218
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,411
You'll be able to walk.

219
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:36,670
It'll take time…

220
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,423
but you'll be able to walk.

221
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,347
What bullshit.

222
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,396
That's so phony.

223
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:16,918
How satisfying!

224
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:23,342
You always drop by
when I'm cooking dinner.

225
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,968
Something's bothering me.

226
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:26,887
What is it?

227
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:31,058
I want to know about the murders in Tokyo
in December four years ago.

228
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:34,061
Why do you want to know that?
Look it up yourself.

229
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:37,981
I got work, and your memory is insane.

230
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:42,319
Insane? Can't you be more complimentary?

231
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:44,404
For goodness' sake.

232
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:49,409
Four years ago? I'll tell you what I know,
but it won't be everything.

233
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:55,582
December 4, Nerima City.

234
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,793
-A robber hit a pub--
-No.

235
00:22:58,502 --> 00:22:59,836
December 19, Shinjuku City.

236
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,589
-A man walking his dog--
-No.

237
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,466
December 20, Minato City.

238
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,635
-A parking structure--
-That's it.

239
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,806
Kenji Kawahira, 28, unemployed,

240
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:14,267
had his throat slit by someone
while sitting in his car.

241
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,229
The car then went out of control

242
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:21,399
and drove off the fourth floor
of the parking structure. Kawahira died.

243
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,442
What else?

244
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:26,988
After Kawahira's death,
he was charged with prostitution.

245
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,032
There was a girl at the scene too.

246
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,623
Hinako Saba, 16.

247
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:40,335
She was discovered near the scene
by a parking lot employee.

248
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:41,795
She was unconscious.

249
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:45,173
Her connection to the incident
is still under investigation.

250
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:47,134
I see.

251
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,972
Don't tell me it was you who did it.

252
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:55,767
At that time, I killed five people.

253
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,060
Five people?

254
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:03,316
Hold on. You're not getting
any funny ideas, right?

255
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:08,363
Why are we living here
pretending to be siblings?

256
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:10,073
To live ordinary lives.

257
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,117
-Who ordered us to?
-Boss.

258
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,452
Which means no fighting
or causing trouble!

259
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:18,832
And of course,
don't even think about killing.

260
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:21,209
Yes. I know.

261
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,212
Good.

262
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,717
-Is the curry ready yet?
-You want some?

263
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:55,493
I thought I look pretty good in this.
But he called me a venomous snake.

264
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,423
{\an8}MIKI KAWAMURA

265
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:10,300
Misaki…

266
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:14,638
There we go. Misaki…

267
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,891
Misaki…

268
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:21,561
There we go. Yes!

269
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:27,525
Come on. Misaki…

270
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,201
Misaki…

271
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:42,832
We got our next chicken.
I've had my eye on him for a long time.

272
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,751
No slacking. Be serious.

273
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:48,588
You like the plan? Pretty good, isn't it?

274
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,846
Poor guy.

275
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,938
-Good morning.
-Greetings.

276
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,775
Hey, Sato.
Could you do some Christmas drawings?

277
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:10,986
Christmas?

278
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:14,281
Remember how you made drawings
for that animal event before?

279
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,700
The promoter insists on having you
do it again.

280
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:19,160
You want an amateur to draw again?

281
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,622
Remember how excited you got
about Christmas as a kid?

282
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:25,917
That's right. There were presents
waiting for you in the morning.

283
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:29,754
And you'd have a stocking full of…

284
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,931
There weren't presents!
Who'd ever get presents?

285
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:43,101
Of course not!
In fact, getting presents would be insane!

286
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:45,061
But you know Santa Claus, right?

287
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:48,064
No, I don't know him.
I've never met the guy.

288
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:55,697
-That's okay. I haven't either.
-I've never met him either.

289
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:03,079
But if they want my drawings,
then I'd like to do it.

290
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:07,125
Oh, good. And if it works out,
I'll give you a 100-yen-an-hour raise.

291
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:53,254
Jeez, it bothers me even more
from that distance.

292
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,896
If you're rooting for me,
it's creeping me out.

293
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:11,523
No.

294
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,067
I'm not doing this
because of what you said.

295
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:17,153
I know. It's just that…

296
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:20,990
you should go in order.

297
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:23,535
In order?

298
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:27,664
It's no good trying the highest one first.

299
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,708
You should start from the lowest.

300
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,800
Who put you in charge?

301
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:53,273
NPO CHILDREN'S FUTURE

302
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:03,908
Is something wrong?

303
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:06,911
No.

304
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:10,707
Don't be so curt.
We're all on the same team, you know?

305
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:18,715
There's this weird
stalker guy in the park.

306
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,135
A stalker?

307
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,512
Yes.

308
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,974
He talked to me when I was doing PT.

309
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:34,981
As your senior here,
I'll get rid of that guy.

310
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,360
It's also part of my job to keep you safe.

311
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:44,199
Is that right?

312
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:47,535
Thank you.

313
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,292
I didn't ask for help, though.

314
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,514
Hey, that's going a little too far.

315
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,516
Just in case something happens.

316
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,815
You better not cause trouble.

317
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:26,324
You know, Hinako is always
giving me the cold shoulder.

318
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:30,537
Does paralysis
also twist your personality?

319
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,913
Don't be like that.

320
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,749
<i>She's had it rough.</i>

321
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:39,712
<i>When she was in high school,
her parents were killed by a burglar.</i>

322
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:47,303
<i>-Eating wagyu really does it for me.
-It's really delicious!</i>

323
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,848
<i>-This is great!
-Thank you.</i>

324
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,644
<i>Getting revenge is all she lives for.
But her condition makes it hard.</i>

325
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,188
<i>Oh, I see.</i>

326
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:01,651
That must be why
she's doing physical therapy.

327
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:05,196
Yes. I sure hope a miracle happens.

328
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:10,410
A miracle? That's the definition of never.

329
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,375
Hey, let's go.

330
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:27,385
Good evening.
You're a resident here, aren't you?

331
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:29,512
Yes. What about it?

332
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:34,267
We're investigators who specialize
in detecting bugs and hidden cameras.

333
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:37,103
We're with SGP Security.

334
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:40,398
Some bugs and hidden cameras
were found in this building.

335
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,610
-We'd like to check your place.
-Hidden cameras?

336
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:48,031
Yes. The inspection
will only take a moment.

337
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:49,324
And of course, it's free.

338
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:53,703
If you're worried, feel free to ask
another resident to accompany you.

339
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:54,662
SGP SECURITY
SATOSHI IKAWA

340
00:31:56,039 --> 00:32:00,126
No, it's all right. I don't think
there's anything like that in my place.

341
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:06,090
That's what most people say.

342
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:09,510
But those are the people's houses
where we usually find them.

343
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,346
Cameras nowadays are really tiny!

344
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,848
You'd be surprised!

345
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,545
You looking for someone, pal?

346
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,469
The wheelchair girl?

347
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,138
Oh.

348
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,058
Yes.

349
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:00,353
Not sure if you're honest or stupid.

350
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,106
Maybe both.

351
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,026
I'm her brother.

352
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:10,822
Stay away from my sister, you pervert.

353
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,204
Am I…

354
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:20,790
a pervert?

355
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:27,380
Are these two different?

356
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:33,970
They do seem to be
just a little different.

357
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:38,516
Anyway, I decided on two different styles.

358
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,435
Yes. I see you worked hard.

359
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,603
I was up all night drawing them.

360
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:45,898
All night?

361
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:54,073
-You worked hard.
-Boss!

362
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:58,494
Don't laugh! Sato is very serious.

363
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,457
Don't stress over it so much.

364
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:06,711
What's great about your drawings
is their childlike innocence.

365
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:08,379
Just have fun drawing.

366
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,798
Have fun?

367
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,344
By the way, Sato…

368
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:21,100
The NPO's… Why am I laughing? Oh, dear!

369
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:25,188
The NPO's flyers are ready.
I want you to deliver them. Okay?

370
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:28,191
It's very heavy. Now get going.

371
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:29,901
Go deliver them.

372
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,239
He was up all night drawing?

373
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:40,328
What the heck? How could it possibly
take him all night to draw these?

374
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:41,996
How was he drawing them?

375
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,048
This is one hell of a video.

376
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,258
Let me see.

377
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:58,304
What about the ones we put in yesterday?

378
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:00,515
Those are beautiful too.

379
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:07,814
Nice videos! They're perfect!

380
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:11,526
Holy shit! That's so nasty!
Just look at what you can see!

381
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:15,279
Oh, right.
I'll get those business cards made.

382
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,741
I'll get a new suit too.

383
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,827
Hey now! You buy your suits yourself.

384
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,370
Oh, come on now.

385
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:37,927
I'm getting ready
for next month's lecture.

386
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,555
There's a ton of stuff to go through.

387
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:45,059
That's all right. I'll answer it.

388
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,311
Yes?

389
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,367
I'm from Octopus.

390
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:04,829
I have come to deliver your flyers.

391
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,915
Oh, thanks.

392
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:10,918
Whoa!

393
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:14,505
You know him?

394
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:16,465
I see.

395
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:18,885
I'm not so sure.

396
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:25,641
Is that right? At the park?

397
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,604
Go ahead. Have a seat.

398
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:33,399
The guy who kicked you work for me.

399
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,153
He protects her like a younger sister.
I'm sorry about that.

400
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:38,070
I see.

401
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,369
Sato, right?

402
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:49,165
And you delivered our flyers.

403
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:51,709
Must be fate.

404
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:55,338
Thank you.

405
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:58,382
I like the design.
I'm glad we had you do them.

406
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:02,553
Sato, you're concerned
about Hinako's paralysis?

407
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:05,640
I saw her unsteady attempts
and wanted to help.

408
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,851
People think you're a pervert
when you don't mind your own business.

409
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:14,440
Helping someone who's striving desperately
makes them a pervert?

410
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:18,402
Magnificent!

411
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:21,030
You get it!

412
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:25,034
Nowadays, honest and good intentions
are always interpreted as being phony.

413
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,121
Then useless people accuse
real achievers of being hypocrites!

414
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:33,000
And they hide when they do it!
But we don't care!

415
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:37,255
Real achievers plunge ahead
no matter what others say!

416
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,465
That's hot!

417
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,691
You're awesome.

418
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,151
I think we'll get along well.

419
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,333
We're doing
a special Jackal promotion now!

420
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:18,587
-Come check it out!
-That's right!

421
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:21,257
Please, give it a try! Come check it out!

422
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:24,969
Welcome. We're having
a special Jackal promotion.

423
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:26,304
Would you like to try it?

424
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:29,241
That young man just now, he's a nice guy.

425
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:34,080
He's a few cards short of a full deck,
but he's unique.

426
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:39,668
I heard you're doing physical therapy.

427
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:44,215
It's important to have hope.

428
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,850
But…

429
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,854
always be ready for disappointment.

430
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:18,874
I…

431
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,921
have my period today.

432
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:26,549
You think I care?

433
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:30,302
I like blood.

434
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:00,749
Oden today, is it?

435
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,878
You time it perfectly, don't you?

436
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:05,796
What's that?

437
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:08,090
A Jackal balloon.

438
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,135
Really?

439
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:20,936
-I met a guy I was once supposed to kill.
-What?

440
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:25,649
Remember when I killed five people
four years ago?

441
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:32,406
<i>I was ordered to kill six.</i>

442
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:35,618
<i>But one was canceled at the last minute.</i>

443
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:37,119
<i>-How come?
-I don't know.</i>

444
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:40,414
<i>-Boss' decision.
-So you met the sixth guy?</i>

445
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,044
<i>He calls himself Utsubo now.</i>

446
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:48,380
<i>He runs a non-profit organization
that protects children.</i>

447
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:52,468
Naturally, I only talked to him normally
and left.

448
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,472
But do you think I should kill him?

449
00:41:56,972 --> 00:42:00,267
-No! It was canceled, right?
-It smells.

450
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,771
Smells? Like evil?

451
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:08,234
-Like oden.
-Oh, that? You're so confounding!

452
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:11,320
-Hinako Saba was there too.
-What?

453
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:15,908
-Wasn't she in the parking lot incident?
-And her big brother.

454
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,202
He's probably a pro.

455
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:21,038
And then, there's Utsubo.

456
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,375
What an odd team.

457
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,202
<i>Listen. Don't you dare make trouble.</i>

458
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,122
If you kill anyone while on break,

459
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,708
then I'll kill you.

460
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:25,936
Okay.

461
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,025
Hello?

462
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:34,278
<i>I am Utsubo. I run a detective agency.</i>

463
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:36,447
Yes?

464
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:40,784
<i>I would like to speak to you
about your son, Etsuji.</i>

465
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,828
<i>What did Etsuji do?</i>

466
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:46,081
<i>Well, I'd like to see you
as soon as possible about it.</i>

467
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,050
I'll get to the point, Etsuji.

468
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:22,636
Do you know a woman named Misaki Shimizu?

469
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:25,848
She's my co-worker.

470
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:30,060
Did you know that she once worked
as a pinup girl?

471
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:32,563
Is that right?

472
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,526
Mr. Yamamoto here, the president
of the agency who represented her,

473
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:39,361
wants her to make a comeback.

474
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:41,363
We've been working on it for a year.

475
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:47,119
That's right. We did a thorough check
just to be sure.

476
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:50,497
If there were any scandals,
it would end her chances.

477
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,626
And we did find something.

478
00:45:55,752 --> 00:45:57,713
Hidden cameras in Misaki's place.

479
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:00,674
Etsuji.

480
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:03,510
Sound familiar?

481
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:06,346
-Hey! Hold on--
-What? What are you implying?

482
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,182
According to Misaki,

483
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:11,810
the key to her place disappeared
from her workplace this July.

484
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:15,981
Dammit! I didn't do it! You fucking jerks!

485
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:18,108
Are you accusing my son?
I've never been so offended!

486
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:21,403
Do you have any proof?
Show it to me right now!

487
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:22,654
-Show me!
-This is insane!

488
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:25,199
I didn't want to have to show you this.

489
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:29,286
These are videos from the hidden cameras
found in Misaki's place.

490
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:34,166
These are motion sensor cameras,
so they turn on when being installed.

491
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:37,669
-What?
-No… I didn't do this!

492
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:41,131
There were even cameras in the bath,
toilet, and changing area.

493
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:42,758
There were a total of four.

494
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:45,093
No… I didn't do this!

495
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:48,388
These aren't the ones I installed!
Someone else--

496
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:56,563
Stop with the pathetic denials.

497
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:00,484
Nobody will believe them.

498
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:04,863
Etsuji!

499
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:11,537
If you took videos like these,
then we'll have to drag you to court.

500
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:14,456
Now, now, Mr. Yamamoto.
I know how you feel,

501
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:17,709
but I'm sure we could come
to some kind of settlement.

502
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:19,795
The court takes time and energy.

503
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:25,467
What's more, we also need to
think about Etsuji's future.

504
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:27,052
Right?

505
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:36,478
Misaki…

506
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:44,528
This is all your fault.

507
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:47,698
You…

508
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,868
You framed me, dammit.

509
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:58,834
I'll kill you.

510
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:03,589
I'll kill you… Misaki.

511
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:08,093
<i>I'll kill you… Misaki.</i>

512
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:12,431
Mr. Utsubo, Kainuma has flipped his lid.

513
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:16,893
<i>You don't want him to go nuts
and kill Misaki, do you?</i>

514
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,354
Well, it could happen.

515
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:23,525
It would be more natural for him
to disappear then. More dramatic.

516
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:26,278
<i>You're brutal, man.</i>

517
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:31,950
However, before the police arrest Kainuma,
we need to get rid of him.

518
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,622
I don't want to lose that 60 million yen.

519
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:45,130
Oh, boss! Please cut it out!

520
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:49,134
-Morning.
-Kainuma, good morning.

521
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,887
{\an8}Just listen to what the boss--

522
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:56,975
I can't help it! My stomach is so upset!
Keep quiet now! Quiet down!

523
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:04,941
Oh, you! That reeks!
Go to the bathroom, would you?

524
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:07,110
Maybe I've been drinking too much.

525
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:11,406
I've been going to the bathroom,
but all that comes out are farts.

526
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,116
And now that you mention it…

527
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,537
Aw, man. I have to go to the bathroom.

528
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:22,918
Working here stinks!

529
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:46,692
Only farts come out…

530
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,199
What?

531
00:49:58,078 --> 00:49:59,413
Sato, did you…

532
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,585
What happened?

533
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:10,549
He was holding this,
and he was about to do something to me.

534
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:13,260
When I turned around,
he suddenly fell over.

535
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:21,143
Yes. That's what happened.

536
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:25,230
Why would Kainuma want to hurt you, Sato?

537
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:26,940
I don't know.

538
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:32,070
I'll go after him.

539
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:41,663
Well, well.

540
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:12,027
When I kidnapped Kainuma,
that Sato guy saw me.

541
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:14,154
-<i>Help!</i>
-Sato did?

542
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:18,033
<i>I'll get rid of him
before the police get involved.</i>

543
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:23,872
Why Sato, of all people?
Whatever. Do it like you said.

544
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:30,462
What's up?

545
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:34,424
-I've got to take care of something.
-Hey!

546
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,343
Someone help!

547
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,804
-Take him to the hills and watch him.
-Hey!

548
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:39,888
Hey!

549
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,892
Hey! Help!

550
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:46,186
-Just a moment.
-Okay.

551
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:49,272
I can hardly wait.

552
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,203
-There you go.
-Thank you.

553
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:18,051
-I want some <i>takoyaki</i> now!
-No!

554
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:19,719
Wait till we get home.

555
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,348
<i>Takoyaki</i>!

556
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:31,982
I want you to bring Kainuma back.

557
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:35,986
I won't ask why you took him.

558
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,697
Just return him alive,
and all will be fine.

559
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:43,869
You know who I am.
How can you ask for that?

560
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:45,954
I'm sure you have your reasons.

561
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:47,873
But…

562
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:50,917
I also have mine.

563
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,880
Who the hell are you?

564
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:57,716
I'll give you until tomorrow.

565
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:00,635
If you won't return him…

566
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:05,640
shit you could never imagine
will hit the fan.

567
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:09,227
You've got 24 hours.

568
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:23,199
Where's Kainuma?

569
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:26,870
Sorry. I couldn't find him.

570
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:28,830
I see.

571
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:31,458
Boss, what will we do?

572
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:36,254
Call the police. That's what's best.

573
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:38,298
Okay.

574
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:41,635
Sato.

575
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:44,137
Hello?

576
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:49,267
You're actually…

577
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:52,812
someone who can kill people, right?

578
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:04,950
I've been around for a while,
so I can sense this kind of thing.

579
00:54:06,242 --> 00:54:10,413
I bet you used to be
a hell of a martial arts fighter.

580
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:12,999
Then one day,
while defending someone you love,

581
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:17,504
a small argument turned into a real fight,
and you ended up

582
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:20,173
seriously injuring your opponent.

583
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:22,467
You're a gentle soul,

584
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:24,594
so you hid your skills
and stopped fighting.

585
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:28,848
And since then,
rather than hurting anyone else,

586
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:34,688
you avoid fights and even pretend to cry
when they happen.

587
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:39,901
That's basically your story, isn't it?

588
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:42,195
Right?

589
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,490
That's exactly right, boss.

590
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:49,619
I knew it.

591
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:51,246
I knew that was it.

592
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:56,334
Don't you worry.

593
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:00,046
I won't tell a soul!

594
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,095
Thank you.

595
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:11,099
-Help!
-Hey!

596
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:15,520
-Shut the fuck up, you goddamn chicken!
-Cut that out!

597
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:18,481
You want to die?
Come on! Answer the question!

598
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:22,527
<i>It doesn't seem like he knows
where Sato lives.</i>

599
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:23,737
<i>Ow! That fucking hurts!</i>

600
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,780
Don't you know where he lives?

601
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:28,033
I only know where his sister lives.

602
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:29,993
Misaki stayed there several times.

603
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:33,538
Really? What's the address?

604
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:37,667
Taiheiji, Asase-cho, 3…

605
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:41,504
<i>What? No way, you lying son of a bitch!</i>

606
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:42,547
What's wrong?

607
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:45,925
<i>There's something fishy about this.</i>

608
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:47,385
Fishy?

609
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:50,055
Yes. If I'm not mistaken,

610
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:52,807
that's the address of
the Maguro Company dorm.

611
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:55,477
Maguro Company?

612
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:33,098
I knew it.
You time it right when I'm cooking.

613
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:35,183
Won't you just admit it?

614
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:45,610
Anyway, sit down.

615
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:15,974
-Who are you?
-I'll ask the questions.

616
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:18,268
Try anything funny and I'll shoot you.

617
00:57:29,654 --> 00:57:32,532
You have a brother, right?
A guy named Fable.

618
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:36,244
Who was it? Fab?

619
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:40,457
That shit is pointless.

620
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:44,544
First, as his sister,
you're way too damn calm.

621
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:48,089
Secondly, I know that
this is the Maguro Company dorm.

622
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:51,551
Also, you got the same smell
as your brother.

623
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:54,012
-Then you got the wrong person.
-What do you mean?

624
00:57:54,095 --> 00:57:59,225
You certainly underestimate me,
coming alone like this.

625
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:01,728
For example,
you put your gun on the table.

626
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:03,938
Are you sure you want it there?

627
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:08,234
Both your hands are down too.
Are you sure you want that?

628
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,028
I like this kind of thing.

629
00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:14,657
If you think you can take the gun,
then try it.

630
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:16,826
Do you know why I'm saying this?

631
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:22,582
I'm giving you a chance.

632
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:32,258
I told you. You got the wrong person.

633
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:35,011
I see you know how to handle a gun.

634
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:38,765
But you've never killed anyone.

635
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:43,394
Is that right?

636
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:47,023
Well, I certainly hope
you're right about that.

637
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:50,401
Hit men have a certain smell.

638
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:53,446
What the hell are you here for, anyway?

639
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:56,282
To test the legend about your brother.

640
00:58:57,575 --> 00:59:00,537
The one who is said to be
able to kill anyone in just six seconds.

641
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:07,335
Then,

642
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:13,758
why don't I prove… it… to… you?

643
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:15,552
Your food's about to burn.

644
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:20,014
It's okay. I can do it in five seconds.

645
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:53,631
{\an8}Eight seconds?

646
00:59:56,467 --> 00:59:58,386
The <i>mapo</i> tofu's almost burnt.

647
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:06,561
What?

648
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:09,022
What?

649
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:11,983
What? Uh-oh.

650
01:00:14,652 --> 01:00:17,822
Uh-oh. Oh, no! He's gone!

651
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:22,243
Shit! He escaped!

652
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:24,579
Dammit!

653
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:34,047
What the…

654
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:35,840
What?

655
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:38,843
What happened?

656
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:41,346
What the…

657
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:46,476
What?

658
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:53,691
What?

659
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:07,205
Yo.

660
01:01:08,873 --> 01:01:10,041
We have a guest.

661
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:15,254
Why did you come here?

662
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:17,924
Trying to get the jump on me?

663
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:19,801
Yes, I guess you could say that.

664
01:01:20,426 --> 01:01:22,178
But I got the shit beat out of me.

665
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:26,808
If your sister's that good,
then you must be even better.

666
01:01:26,891 --> 01:01:29,102
-Probably 100 times better.
-Oh, fuck off.

667
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:34,065
I knew it.

668
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:36,067
-You're Fable.
-Don't say it.

669
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:40,029
If you talk too much…

670
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:44,742
then you'll have to be disposed of.

671
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:53,584
I only want one thing.

672
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:58,047
Release Kainuma alive.

673
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:06,597
What? Kainuma? Oh, yes.

674
01:02:07,598 --> 01:02:08,683
Kainuma, right?

675
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:11,102
Well, you see…

676
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:14,689
There was a small problem. Yes.

677
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:17,275
And, you see…

678
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:21,821
He… kind of like, dead.

679
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:26,284
Mr. Suzuki! What should I do?

680
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:30,538
<i>Mr. Utsubo is going to kill me--</i>

681
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:35,209
Too bad.

682
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:39,714
I didn't want anyone in my life
to die now.

683
01:02:42,049 --> 01:02:43,801
People always did before.

684
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:37,605
Suzuki, you can go.

685
01:03:58,501 --> 01:03:59,752
Why are you letting me go?

686
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:04,173
Because you don't think I'm a threat?

687
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:09,345
Want some <i>mapo</i> tofu?

688
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,524
He seemed angry.

689
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:24,527
Of course, he was.
We totally crushed his pride.

690
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:28,072
But are you sure…

691
01:04:29,615 --> 01:04:30,950
it's okay to let him go?

692
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:33,953
It'll be fine. He's a pro too.

693
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:36,247
I can smell it.

694
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:38,124
There you go with smells again.

695
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:41,836
You ticked me off.

696
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:47,258
Oh.

697
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:49,093
I see you're back.

698
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:54,891
How did you get that injury?

699
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:03,733
Isaki… He killed Kainuma.

700
01:05:04,358 --> 01:05:06,861
It was an accident. So…

701
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:10,948
since he was scared and might run,
I got rid of him.

702
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:14,952
That's not all, right?

703
01:05:18,205 --> 01:05:19,749
Murphy's Law.

704
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:21,918
Murphy's Law?

705
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:26,047
You mean he's closer than expected?

706
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:37,099
-Wait. Do you mean--
-That's right. He's Fable.

707
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:41,395
Sato is Fable.

708
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:46,150
Sato is?

709
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:51,447
Give me all the details.

710
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:53,449
Where does this put us?

711
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:57,244
Is this trouble?

712
01:05:58,663 --> 01:05:59,997
Or do we celebrate?

713
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,543
We celebrate, of course.

714
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:13,928
Then tell me,
what makes you so ready to face him?

715
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:19,308
I was too careless,
and his sister did me in.

716
01:06:21,435 --> 01:06:23,521
I was ready to meet my maker.

717
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:28,526
But Sato even asked me to eat with them!

718
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:33,948
Facelifts make me look young,
but I'm still 40 inside.

719
01:06:34,448 --> 01:06:36,867
For my pride that disappeared like smoke…

720
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:39,912
and to go out in a blaze of glory…

721
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:44,625
I'm willing to risk my life.

722
01:06:52,466 --> 01:06:56,220
My reasons are simpler than yours…

723
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:58,681
but more dramatic.

724
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:05,730
Four years ago,
I was running a prostitution ring.

725
01:07:07,231 --> 01:07:08,065
Four years ago,

726
01:07:09,066 --> 01:07:11,819
Hinako Saba was in that car.

727
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:19,952
<i>The last guy killed by Fable…</i>

728
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:23,748
was my brother.

729
01:07:24,415 --> 01:07:26,333
I never knew that.

730
01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:29,754
He was killed, along with four of my pals.

731
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:33,674
<i>He was my brother by blood.</i>

732
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:35,259
<i>You mean…</i>

733
01:07:35,843 --> 01:07:37,595
she became paralyzed…

734
01:07:39,263 --> 01:07:40,931
because of what happened?

735
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:42,767
<i>His throat…</i>

736
01:07:45,269 --> 01:07:47,188
<i>was slit by Fable…</i>

737
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:50,983
<i>and he went over inside the car.</i>

738
01:08:15,382 --> 01:08:17,802
I will kill that bastard, Fable,
with my own hands!

739
01:08:17,885 --> 01:08:20,012
I've searched this whole time to find him!

740
01:08:21,388 --> 01:08:24,100
-Hey!
-I came to this town to kill that bastard!

741
01:08:25,017 --> 01:08:26,102
Stop!

742
01:08:32,858 --> 01:08:34,777
I will end that bastard's life.

743
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:39,073
I will risk my own life
in order to avenge my brother!

744
01:08:41,867 --> 01:08:44,036
All right!

745
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:47,540
Let's kill Fable. Together.

746
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:49,125
Yes.

747
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:54,213
But we can't do it half-assed.

748
01:08:56,173 --> 01:08:57,591
We'll work on a plan tomorrow.

749
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:01,011
Let's rest tonight.

750
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:19,196
It's a little strong.

751
01:09:35,921 --> 01:09:37,131
I see.

752
01:09:39,717 --> 01:09:40,759
But…

753
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:44,805
I mean, I feel bad
that she's in a wheelchair.

754
01:09:46,056 --> 01:09:48,475
But she ran away from home
and became a hooker.

755
01:09:49,768 --> 01:09:51,979
-Maybe it serves her right--
-I don't think so.

756
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:54,398
What?

757
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:59,195
When I saw her… Hinako Saba was crying.

758
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:05,910
<i>It took me two seconds
to break the window and kill Kawahira.</i>

759
01:10:08,329 --> 01:10:09,914
<i>Nobody can cry in two seconds.</i>

760
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:24,970
A landmine?

761
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:31,477
Hey, how the heck
did you get your hands on this?

762
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:35,397
I have lots of connections.
I've collected this stuff over the years.

763
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:38,192
Yes, but there are limits.

764
01:10:39,193 --> 01:10:41,487
How are we supposed to use these?

765
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:42,571
In our plan.

766
01:10:43,697 --> 01:10:45,366
We're up against Fable.

767
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:48,244
Unless we've got the perfect plan,

768
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:51,914
weapons and men are
just as good as a pile of rubbish.

769
01:12:56,830 --> 01:12:58,082
You scared me.

770
01:13:01,335 --> 01:13:03,670
If you were watching,
catch me before I fall.

771
01:13:04,421 --> 01:13:07,049
I didn't want to interfere
while you were trying so hard.

772
01:13:11,178 --> 01:13:13,514
You said the same thing when we first met.

773
01:13:34,451 --> 01:13:35,452
Can I touch them?

774
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:38,038
What?

775
01:13:51,135 --> 01:13:52,344
Your hands will get dirty.

776
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:54,847
Where I came from, this isn't dirty.

777
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:57,766
You've got to picture it.

778
01:13:59,059 --> 01:14:01,812
You always have to picture in your mind
that your legs work.

779
01:14:04,148 --> 01:14:05,232
Picture it?

780
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:10,154
From the flow of blood in your veins…

781
01:14:13,073 --> 01:14:14,825
to your nerves and muscles…

782
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:18,078
even to the shifting of your weight.

783
01:14:20,247 --> 01:14:21,582
How come you know that stuff?

784
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:27,296
Sato…

785
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:30,757
what kind of life have you had until now?

786
01:14:35,596 --> 01:14:36,513
<i>Come on.</i>

787
01:14:37,681 --> 01:14:38,849
<i>Tell me.</i>

788
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:41,894
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

789
01:15:06,877 --> 01:15:09,254
What kind of life have you had until now?

790
01:15:12,549 --> 01:15:13,467
Come on.

791
01:15:14,426 --> 01:15:15,427
Tell me.

792
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:22,309
I…

793
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:23,745
Here.

794
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:39,177
I have a fairly good idea…

795
01:16:43,223 --> 01:16:44,725
about what you're planning.

796
01:16:53,817 --> 01:16:55,235
I won't see Sato anymore.

797
01:16:58,322 --> 01:17:01,408
So don't hurt Sato
or those around him anymore.

798
01:17:07,414 --> 01:17:10,500
Why are you so particular about Sato?

799
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:15,922
Sato…

800
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:19,885
gives me self-confidence.

801
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:38,153
Is that right?

802
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:45,035
The truth is…

803
01:17:48,038 --> 01:17:50,040
when Suzuki checked him out…

804
01:17:52,459 --> 01:17:54,211
we found something.

805
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:01,093
I'm not sure…

806
01:18:03,512 --> 01:18:05,138
if I should tell you this or not.

807
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:16,858
But…

808
01:18:18,819 --> 01:18:19,986
I really should.

809
01:18:35,585 --> 01:18:36,586
Four years ago…

810
01:18:38,338 --> 01:18:42,592
a man was killed…
before your very eyes, right?

811
01:18:45,846 --> 01:18:47,681
He was part of a prostitution ring.

812
01:18:49,891 --> 01:18:51,143
The one who killed him…

813
01:18:53,478 --> 01:18:54,980
was Sato.

814
01:19:05,282 --> 01:19:06,533
You're kidding.

815
01:19:07,659 --> 01:19:08,744
And that's not all.

816
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:13,498
Two days later, he entered your house…

817
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:16,209
and he…

818
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:27,888
he slit your mother and father's throats.

819
01:19:30,474 --> 01:19:31,975
That was Sato too.

820
01:19:53,747 --> 01:19:55,248
<i>Show me your boobies.</i>

821
01:19:55,332 --> 01:19:57,626
<i>What? Don't be stupid.</i>

822
01:19:57,709 --> 01:19:59,294
<i>Why are you ashamed?</i>

823
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:01,963
<i>It's my boobs! Of course, I am!</i>

824
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:04,090
<i>Then why aren't you ashamed
to show your arms?</i>

825
01:20:04,674 --> 01:20:06,510
<i>-Arms are different.
-What's different?</i>

826
01:20:08,595 --> 01:20:11,014
<i>What's the difference
between boobies and arms?</i>

827
01:20:11,598 --> 01:20:12,432
<i>They're the same!</i>

828
01:20:13,391 --> 01:20:16,019
<i>Arms are okay, but boobies aren't?
How come?</i>

829
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:20,440
<i>It's discrimination!
What you're doing is discrimination!</i>

830
01:20:21,066 --> 01:20:24,277
<i>You should apologize to your breasts!</i>

831
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:29,366
<i>I want to be a woman
who treats everything equally!</i>

832
01:20:33,703 --> 01:20:36,873
<i>Success!</i>

833
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:39,417
<i>A WEEKDAY NAMED LOVE</i>
TO BE CONTINUED

834
01:20:40,293 --> 01:20:42,587
Jackal sure is passionate.

835
01:21:12,325 --> 01:21:13,493
Don't you worry.

836
01:21:14,369 --> 01:21:17,247
Don't be frightened. I'm here.

837
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:54,993
Give me a gun too.

838
01:21:57,495 --> 01:21:58,622
To kill Sato?

839
01:22:15,138 --> 01:22:16,139
It's too dangerous.

840
01:22:17,223 --> 01:22:18,725
I'll give you the bullets later.

841
01:22:20,435 --> 01:22:21,770
Get used to holding it.

842
01:23:00,266 --> 01:23:01,267
Hold on a sec.

843
01:23:10,986 --> 01:23:12,737
How do you want your pasta?

844
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:14,990
Easy on the salt.
The <i>mapo</i> tofu was too salty.

845
01:23:15,073 --> 01:23:16,241
Not my fault!

846
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:27,752
Hello?

847
01:23:28,336 --> 01:23:31,673
<i>Hello there, Sato.
It was nice seeing you the other day.</i>

848
01:23:33,091 --> 01:23:33,925
Utsubo.

849
01:23:35,135 --> 01:23:37,470
<i>I'm honored that you remember me.</i>

850
01:23:38,054 --> 01:23:39,514
Koichi Kawahira.

851
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:41,224
AKIRA SATO

852
01:23:41,307 --> 01:23:44,769
You even know my real name.
I feel even more honored.

853
01:23:45,603 --> 01:23:48,857
Okay. I'll change what I call you too.

854
01:23:50,775 --> 01:23:51,609
Fable.

855
01:23:55,405 --> 01:23:58,158
<i>I want to talk to you.
Can you come and see me?</i>

856
01:23:58,742 --> 01:23:59,826
What do you want to talk about?

857
01:24:00,410 --> 01:24:01,828
Hinako, of course.

858
01:24:01,911 --> 01:24:05,665
You feel guilty.
That's why you approached her, right?

859
01:24:13,548 --> 01:24:15,050
Guess I hit the bullseye.

860
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:19,596
Didn't expect the legendary hit man
to have such feelings.

861
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:24,017
Let's talk about Hinako's future.
Come to my office in an hour.

862
01:24:24,601 --> 01:24:25,477
All right.

863
01:24:28,354 --> 01:24:30,565
-I'm going out for a bit.
-What? Where?

864
01:24:30,648 --> 01:24:32,984
-Utsubo's office.
-It's a trap for sure.

865
01:24:33,568 --> 01:24:36,279
Yes, but I'll still go.
It's my responsibility.

866
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:39,699
-That's what ordinary people do, right?
-Don't kill anyone.

867
01:24:41,826 --> 01:24:42,827
I know.

868
01:24:43,578 --> 01:24:45,997
Hold on a second. I'm going with you.

869
01:24:47,123 --> 01:24:49,918
If I know it's a trap,
I can't let you go alone.

870
01:24:54,214 --> 01:24:56,049
-Don't get in the way.
-I won't!

871
01:25:19,197 --> 01:25:20,448
JACKAL

872
01:25:20,532 --> 01:25:23,660
-Whoa!
-What are you doing? That was mine!

873
01:25:25,745 --> 01:25:27,122
Jackal's gone now!

874
01:25:31,167 --> 01:25:33,670
Utsubo has probably shut down
the security cameras.

875
01:25:34,254 --> 01:25:37,173
Don't let your guard down.
This is totally a trap.

876
01:25:41,845 --> 01:25:43,221
Fable's on the eighth floor.

877
01:25:53,439 --> 01:25:54,524
Is he having a seizure?

878
01:25:59,445 --> 01:26:02,198
That's the way. Keep on going.

879
01:27:11,351 --> 01:27:13,186
You okay? Hello?

880
01:27:13,937 --> 01:27:14,812
Did it work?

881
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:23,279
-<i>Akira! Are you all right?</i>
-Yes. No problem.

882
01:27:25,698 --> 01:27:26,866
Are you kidding me?

883
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:30,411
What do you mean no problem?
They planted a bomb!

884
01:27:30,954 --> 01:27:33,873
-It was a hand grenade trap.
-You set it off on purpose?

885
01:27:33,957 --> 01:27:36,751
It would have seriously injured
anyone who went in.

886
01:27:42,131 --> 01:27:43,424
<i>Fable fled to the sixth floor.</i>

887
01:27:43,508 --> 01:27:44,968
Switch to Plan B.

888
01:27:45,051 --> 01:27:46,678
<i>Copy. Awaiting instructions.</i>

889
01:27:46,761 --> 01:27:48,680
<i>Squad A, go in for the attack.</i>

890
01:27:49,514 --> 01:27:53,351
<i>-Squad A. Copy.
-He entered a house. Follow him.</i>

891
01:27:53,977 --> 01:27:56,104
<i>Squad A, commencing operations.</i>

892
01:27:56,187 --> 01:27:59,274
<i>Squad B, standing by in the east corridor.
Awaiting instructions.</i>

893
01:28:00,650 --> 01:28:03,069
<i>Squad C, sixth floor, west side.
Standing by.</i>

894
01:28:03,903 --> 01:28:06,614
<i>We're up against Fable.
Take it nice and slow.</i>

895
01:28:07,282 --> 01:28:08,283
<i>Don't get careless.</i>

896
01:28:09,075 --> 01:28:11,995
<i>Copy. Squad B, standing by
on the sixth floor, east side.</i>

897
01:28:12,078 --> 01:28:13,079
<i>Awaiting instructions.</i>

898
01:28:22,046 --> 01:28:25,550
<i>Fable fleeing on balcony side
of sixth floor. Squads B and C, move in.</i>

899
01:28:27,343 --> 01:28:28,428
<i>Squad B, copy.</i>

900
01:28:28,511 --> 01:28:31,848
<i>He went inside.
Squad A and B, go to the corridor.</i>

901
01:28:33,474 --> 01:28:34,976
<i>Squad A, copy.</i>

902
01:28:35,059 --> 01:28:37,562
<i>Squad B, copy. Commencing operations.</i>

903
01:28:37,645 --> 01:28:40,231
He's passing through 1063.
He'll enter the corridor.

904
01:28:40,815 --> 01:28:42,066
<i>Copy. What's the situation?</i>

905
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:44,027
<i>He's out. Squad A, stop him.</i>

906
01:28:44,694 --> 01:28:47,196
<i>Squad A, copy.
Commencing operations according to plan.</i>

907
01:28:49,532 --> 01:28:51,951
You know, maybe we should go downstairs.

908
01:28:54,078 --> 01:28:55,705
<i>Damn. He got him.</i>

909
01:28:57,123 --> 01:28:59,083
He's descending the stairs
with the other residents.

910
01:28:59,792 --> 01:29:01,294
<i>Close in from above and below.</i>

911
01:29:01,377 --> 01:29:03,921
<i>Squad A, copy. Squad B, let's go.</i>

912
01:29:04,422 --> 01:29:06,049
<i>Squad B, copy.</i>

913
01:29:06,132 --> 01:29:07,258
Don't push!

914
01:29:07,342 --> 01:29:09,761
It's so tight in here,
I can't help pushing.

915
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:11,429
That's dangerous.

916
01:29:12,096 --> 01:29:14,307
<i>Don't hesitate!
His gun doesn't have real bullets!</i>

917
01:30:03,898 --> 01:30:05,233
<i>Fable's on the first floor.</i>

918
01:30:05,316 --> 01:30:07,151
<i>-Roger.
-Copy, moving to ground level.</i>

919
01:30:07,235 --> 01:30:08,069
<i>Copy.</i>

920
01:30:08,152 --> 01:30:09,153
-Oh, hello.
-<i>Copy.</i>

921
01:30:09,737 --> 01:30:10,780
Look at all that smoke!

922
01:30:15,034 --> 01:30:16,911
<i>You're pretty damn good, Fable.</i>

923
01:30:17,453 --> 01:30:18,871
<i>Better than I imagined.</i>

924
01:30:18,955 --> 01:30:22,416
<i>But I want to win too,
and I'll do whatever it takes.</i>

925
01:30:23,584 --> 01:30:28,339
<i>There's a deaf girl who lives in 3108.</i>

926
01:30:28,422 --> 01:30:31,551
<i>I've given her a present for you.</i>

927
01:30:32,635 --> 01:30:36,347
<i>You better go see her
before there's big trouble.</i>

928
01:30:37,431 --> 01:30:41,102
-<i>Yoko, get the sniper on the balcony side.</i>
-Got it.

929
01:30:42,353 --> 01:30:45,398
<i>I repeat,
Fable's gun doesn't hold real bullets.</i>

930
01:30:45,481 --> 01:30:46,732
<i>Don't get frightened!</i>

931
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:50,236
There he is.
Third floor scaffolding, west side.

932
01:30:50,319 --> 01:30:51,362
<i>Stop him.</i>

933
01:30:53,656 --> 01:30:56,450
-<i>Squad A and D, move in.</i>
-He's on the fourth floor now.

934
01:31:02,415 --> 01:31:04,584
JACKAL

935
01:31:08,045 --> 01:31:08,921
It's too narrow!

936
01:31:09,005 --> 01:31:11,799
-Don't push, man!
-I'm not! You're pulling!

937
01:31:11,883 --> 01:31:13,467
Oh, dammit!

938
01:31:37,742 --> 01:31:39,202
<i>Go! Go! Trap him!</i>

939
01:31:39,994 --> 01:31:41,829
<i>Stop him! Don't panic!</i>

940
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:44,415
<i>Squad B, get in there!</i>

941
01:31:45,249 --> 01:31:46,459
<i>Everyone, surround him!</i>

942
01:31:58,137 --> 01:31:59,472
<i>He's up on the fifth floor!</i>

943
01:32:04,101 --> 01:32:06,062
Come on. Let's go. Look forward.

944
01:32:09,941 --> 01:32:11,025
Shit!

945
01:32:11,108 --> 01:32:15,446
Mr. Utsubo, it's just as you expected.
We'll finish him using Plan C.

946
01:32:36,467 --> 01:32:37,635
<i>There he is. Balcony side.</i>

947
01:32:39,053 --> 01:32:41,389
<i>-Squad C, copy.
-Squad D, copy.</i>

948
01:32:41,472 --> 01:32:44,392
<i>Squad B, take the lead.
Squad C, follow Squad D.</i>

949
01:32:52,775 --> 01:32:54,527
<i>Squad C, surround him above and below!</i>

950
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:10,501
Die!

951
01:33:29,562 --> 01:33:30,938
<i>He entered the tenth floor.</i>

952
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:33,733
<i>He'll head for 3108.</i>

953
01:34:13,272 --> 01:34:14,190
Shit.

954
01:34:32,124 --> 01:34:33,042
Hey.

955
01:34:37,421 --> 01:34:40,007
Emergency. The kid left the condo.

956
01:34:40,091 --> 01:34:41,467
Seriously?

957
01:34:41,550 --> 01:34:47,014
<i>Damn, kids are the greatest!
They always do the unexpected.</i>

958
01:34:47,098 --> 01:34:49,642
-What will we do?
-<i>Follow the plan, of course.</i>

959
01:35:40,818 --> 01:35:41,652
Shit!

960
01:36:07,636 --> 01:36:10,973
<i>-Tenth floor scaffolding! Everyone go!
-Copy.</i>

961
01:36:51,305 --> 01:36:52,765
Akira! Big problem!

962
01:36:53,349 --> 01:36:55,476
There's a girl
at the end of the scaffolding!

963
01:36:55,559 --> 01:36:57,978
<i>No! Stop!</i>

964
01:36:58,062 --> 01:37:01,190
<i>Akira! Stop her!</i>

965
01:37:42,147 --> 01:37:43,274
Akira?

966
01:37:43,357 --> 01:37:45,276
<i>Don't worry. It's under control.</i>

967
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:46,986
You call that under control?

968
01:38:14,805 --> 01:38:18,475
Oh, please. Just don't kill anyone.

969
01:39:01,018 --> 01:39:04,021
Success!

970
01:39:25,668 --> 01:39:27,378
Yoko, go after Suzuki.

971
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:31,256
-He's in a silver Mini Cooper.
-<i>Roger. What about you?</i>

972
01:39:31,340 --> 01:39:32,633
I'll figure something out.

973
01:39:39,431 --> 01:39:42,059
-It's Sato! Want me to answer?
-No! Let me have it!

974
01:39:46,063 --> 01:39:47,189
Is that you, Sato?

975
01:39:48,357 --> 01:39:51,318
How 'ya doin'? It's been a while.

976
01:39:51,402 --> 01:39:54,363
I'm havin' a good-- That's hot!

977
01:39:56,990 --> 01:39:58,951
<i>Can you get me a ride?</i>

978
01:39:59,034 --> 01:40:00,869
<i>A ride? What about the Hakosuka?</i>

979
01:40:00,953 --> 01:40:02,788
Yoko's driving that.

980
01:40:02,871 --> 01:40:04,540
I don't really get it…

981
01:40:05,416 --> 01:40:07,668
-but I'll have Kuro bring you one.
-I'll go!

982
01:40:08,335 --> 01:40:10,421
<i>-I'll get there super fast!
-Where you at?</i>

983
01:40:10,504 --> 01:40:14,049
<i>TAKOYAKI</i>

984
01:40:41,326 --> 01:40:42,995
The stars are already out.

985
01:40:45,122 --> 01:40:46,290
You look at the stars?

986
01:40:47,666 --> 01:40:49,752
No matter what a guy like me does,

987
01:40:50,961 --> 01:40:53,380
compared to the vastness of space,

988
01:40:54,047 --> 01:40:55,466
it's infinitesimal.

989
01:40:59,219 --> 01:41:01,054
It means nothing.

990
01:41:02,681 --> 01:41:03,599
All of it.

991
01:41:20,115 --> 01:41:21,450
It's going to bottom out.

992
01:41:44,181 --> 01:41:45,682
That was just a stone I tossed.

993
01:41:46,934 --> 01:41:51,188
Since you lack experience,
you assumed it was a hand grenade.

994
01:41:53,398 --> 01:41:56,151
You've never killed anyone,
so you don't have…

995
01:41:57,820 --> 01:41:59,071
the mettle that I got.

996
01:42:15,754 --> 01:42:17,297
Will Sato follow us?

997
01:42:17,381 --> 01:42:19,383
Jeez, I don't know.

998
01:42:28,141 --> 01:42:29,977
Who is that woman?

999
01:42:30,853 --> 01:42:34,982
She's part of
the same assassin ring Sato's in.

1000
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:37,734
Perfect timing, Hinako.

1001
01:42:40,612 --> 01:42:43,532
For practice, shoot that woman.

1002
01:42:44,741 --> 01:42:45,659
What?

1003
01:42:46,243 --> 01:42:50,497
If you're averse to killing her,
then shoot her in the legs or arms.

1004
01:42:51,248 --> 01:42:52,791
Hey, don't do that.

1005
01:42:53,375 --> 01:42:55,794
She's one of Sato's comrades.

1006
01:43:13,437 --> 01:43:14,438
Hinako!

1007
01:43:30,412 --> 01:43:32,623
Hey! I'm telling you! Don't do it!

1008
01:44:09,034 --> 01:44:09,910
Hinako?

1009
01:44:20,963 --> 01:44:23,340
That hurts!

1010
01:44:26,718 --> 01:44:27,552
What?

1011
01:44:28,136 --> 01:44:30,639
Damn!

1012
01:44:31,348 --> 01:44:32,432
That hurts.

1013
01:44:34,559 --> 01:44:35,644
Ow!

1014
01:44:46,238 --> 01:44:47,239
What's wrong, Hinako?

1015
01:44:49,700 --> 01:44:50,659
What?

1016
01:44:52,744 --> 01:44:53,745
You shocked me.

1017
01:45:03,505 --> 01:45:05,257
You killed my parents.

1018
01:45:05,924 --> 01:45:09,469
You said my parents' throats were slit.

1019
01:45:10,178 --> 01:45:12,723
The police kept that secret,
but you knew it.

1020
01:45:13,682 --> 01:45:15,434
You knew their throats were slit!

1021
01:45:17,144 --> 01:45:18,562
That's because you did it!

1022
01:45:27,988 --> 01:45:30,574
Oh, damn.

1023
01:45:34,286 --> 01:45:37,539
That's where I screwed up.

1024
01:45:55,974 --> 01:45:59,644
That's right. I killed your parents.

1025
01:46:02,898 --> 01:46:03,857
Why?

1026
01:46:08,779 --> 01:46:12,616
<i>I couldn't have you talking to the cops
about the prostitution ring.</i>

1027
01:46:17,037 --> 01:46:19,956
<i>So I killed your parents to frighten you.</i>

1028
01:46:28,965 --> 01:46:30,717
What have I done?

1029
01:46:35,597 --> 01:46:36,681
Hinako.

1030
01:46:39,309 --> 01:46:42,646
Having sex with you was great fun.

1031
01:46:42,729 --> 01:46:45,357
Shut up! It made me want to puke!

1032
01:46:50,362 --> 01:46:52,948
You've got two shots left! Aim straight!

1033
01:46:53,031 --> 01:46:54,533
Dammit!

1034
01:47:02,082 --> 01:47:05,252
Is this really what you want, Sato?

1035
01:47:07,796 --> 01:47:10,549
It's Fable! Shit!

1036
01:47:11,049 --> 01:47:12,050
What is he plotting!

1037
01:47:12,134 --> 01:47:15,053
Come on! Shoot me! Hurry up!

1038
01:47:15,137 --> 01:47:18,306
This is the perfect chance! Come on!

1039
01:47:18,390 --> 01:47:20,976
I won't even move.
But don't shoot my body.

1040
01:47:21,059 --> 01:47:24,146
If you want to kill me, aim for my head.
Come on!

1041
01:47:24,646 --> 01:47:25,730
Come on!

1042
01:47:25,814 --> 01:47:27,149
Dammit!

1043
01:47:27,899 --> 01:47:29,693
Goddammit!

1044
01:47:29,776 --> 01:47:33,864
I have an idea, Hinako! Let me tell you
about when I killed your parents.

1045
01:47:33,947 --> 01:47:35,907
Hey! Fable's coming!

1046
01:47:35,991 --> 01:47:38,952
You see, when they were
weeping and crying,

1047
01:47:39,035 --> 01:47:42,205
they said they didn't care if they died,

1048
01:47:43,081 --> 01:47:45,208
as long as I spared your life!

1049
01:47:48,461 --> 01:47:51,089
Talk about melodramatic!

1050
01:47:52,799 --> 01:47:55,927
It was like some cheap TV drama!

1051
01:47:56,011 --> 01:47:57,888
What a pity.

1052
01:47:57,971 --> 01:48:01,850
You ran away, but the family
that was waiting for you to return

1053
01:48:02,434 --> 01:48:07,105
ended up getting drenched
in their filthy, stinking blood!

1054
01:49:06,498 --> 01:49:09,334
No, Hinako! Stop!
There's a landmine there!

1055
01:49:13,046 --> 01:49:14,214
Listen to me, Hinako!

1056
01:49:14,297 --> 01:49:17,592
Don't move. If you lift your foot,
you'll get blown to bits.

1057
01:49:20,595 --> 01:49:21,805
That was a surprise.

1058
01:49:23,390 --> 01:49:24,224
How…

1059
01:49:25,850 --> 01:49:26,851
the hell…

1060
01:49:28,770 --> 01:49:30,689
could this happen, dammit?

1061
01:49:31,398 --> 01:49:33,525
You've fucked up my whole plan!

1062
01:49:34,234 --> 01:49:36,778
Why the hell are you walking?
Who said you could?

1063
01:49:36,861 --> 01:49:40,490
Your walking has ruined
the landmine meant for Sato!

1064
01:49:40,573 --> 01:49:42,617
Stop her! She'll fall if she shoots!

1065
01:49:42,701 --> 01:49:46,121
-Hinako! Don't shoot!
-I don't care anymore. Just shoot me.

1066
01:49:46,204 --> 01:49:50,125
-Come on! Hurry up and shoot me!
-Why… Why did you…

1067
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:52,127
Those legs didn't do you any good, anyway!

1068
01:49:52,210 --> 01:49:55,505
-Hey! Hinako! Don't shoot!
-Nobody gives a fuck about you!

1069
01:49:55,588 --> 01:49:58,341
-Shut up!
-Go over there and hold her!

1070
01:49:58,425 --> 01:50:01,428
-You can't trick me! Sato's coming!
-What?

1071
01:50:01,511 --> 01:50:03,763
-Come on! Do it!
-Shut up!

1072
01:50:03,847 --> 01:50:06,057
This wasn't in the plan!
Let's call it off!

1073
01:50:06,141 --> 01:50:08,268
Your parents died because you ran away,
you dumb bitch!

1074
01:50:08,351 --> 01:50:11,229
-I'll kill you!
-Stop it, I said!

1075
01:50:11,313 --> 01:50:15,608
See how pretty the stars are?
Mommy and Daddy in the sky are waiting.

1076
01:50:15,692 --> 01:50:18,320
-Don't shoot, Hinako!
-They died covered in blood and shit.

1077
01:50:18,403 --> 01:50:20,113
-Fable's coming!
-Go join them!

1078
01:50:23,491 --> 01:50:24,367
You…

1079
01:50:26,870 --> 01:50:29,539
fucking scumbag!

1080
01:50:37,839 --> 01:50:39,758
This time, I caught you before you fell.

1081
01:50:43,011 --> 01:50:43,887
Sato?

1082
01:50:45,847 --> 01:50:47,057
Fable…

1083
01:50:51,895 --> 01:50:53,229
Leave your foot there.

1084
01:50:53,938 --> 01:50:55,106
Grab onto the wheelchair.

1085
01:51:19,964 --> 01:51:21,007
Sato…

1086
01:51:22,717 --> 01:51:24,969
Is your back okay? Any shrapnel?

1087
01:51:25,553 --> 01:51:26,596
No problem.

1088
01:51:28,223 --> 01:51:29,224
Suzuki.

1089
01:51:30,433 --> 01:51:31,684
Let's save Hinako.

1090
01:51:33,019 --> 01:51:34,270
Why ask for my help?

1091
01:51:34,354 --> 01:51:36,314
You already know what to do.

1092
01:51:51,037 --> 01:51:53,289
A little farther forward. Slowly.

1093
01:51:53,790 --> 01:51:54,624
Lower it.

1094
01:51:55,792 --> 01:51:56,626
Slowly.

1095
01:51:58,711 --> 01:51:59,629
Slowly.

1096
01:52:01,965 --> 01:52:03,091
A little more.

1097
01:52:05,009 --> 01:52:06,261
Slowly.

1098
01:52:11,224 --> 01:52:12,225
One more centimeter.

1099
01:52:16,521 --> 01:52:19,023
There's no way this'll work.

1100
01:52:21,067 --> 01:52:23,778
-You'll both get blown to bits.
-Shut up! Enough of you.

1101
01:52:24,696 --> 01:52:27,657
It seems ridiculous, but these two hit men
are helping each other.

1102
01:52:32,954 --> 01:52:34,038
This won't work.

1103
01:52:35,039 --> 01:52:36,458
Forget about my leg.

1104
01:52:37,375 --> 01:52:38,543
Step away.

1105
01:52:39,711 --> 01:52:41,171
Remember what I said before?

1106
01:52:42,547 --> 01:52:43,965
You'll be able to walk someday.

1107
01:52:46,176 --> 01:52:49,012
In six months,
you'll be taking strolls on those legs.

1108
01:52:55,477 --> 01:52:57,479
Hinako won't last much longer.
Let's do this.

1109
01:52:58,062 --> 01:52:59,063
Right.

1110
01:52:59,814 --> 01:53:03,860
Suzuki, we only get one chance.
I'll count from three to one.

1111
01:53:04,360 --> 01:53:05,487
Sato…

1112
01:53:06,613 --> 01:53:08,323
-I'm counting on you.
-Trust me.

1113
01:53:09,699 --> 01:53:10,825
I'm fast.

1114
01:53:23,713 --> 01:53:24,547
Here goes.

1115
01:53:28,510 --> 01:53:29,344
Three.

1116
01:53:31,221 --> 01:53:32,055
Two.

1117
01:53:33,097 --> 01:53:34,140
One!

1118
01:55:06,232 --> 01:55:08,776
<i>Nice to meet you. I'm Utsubo.</i>

1119
01:55:13,281 --> 01:55:14,282
You'll be able to walk.

1120
01:56:01,829 --> 01:56:02,830
Hinako!

1121
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:19,472
Without Sato's speed…

1122
01:56:21,641 --> 01:56:22,934
you would've lost your foot.

1123
01:56:29,857 --> 01:56:30,858
Hinako.

1124
01:56:41,035 --> 01:56:42,620
Fable is poison.

1125
01:56:44,038 --> 01:56:46,624
But it seems he's good medicine to you.

1126
01:57:18,614 --> 01:57:19,449
It's all right.

1127
01:57:20,867 --> 01:57:22,869
He did it so we'd shoot him.

1128
01:58:21,177 --> 01:58:22,178
Wait.

1129
01:59:23,865 --> 01:59:25,783
Now that he's not here…

1130
01:59:26,951 --> 01:59:29,829
I realized just how good
Kainuma was at his job.

1131
01:59:35,168 --> 01:59:36,586
Good morning, Sato.

1132
01:59:36,669 --> 01:59:38,754
-Good morning.
-Morning.

1133
01:59:39,672 --> 01:59:42,049
I drew Christmas pictures.

1134
01:59:42,133 --> 01:59:43,217
-Whoa.
-Show us.

1135
01:59:53,227 --> 01:59:55,605
Such warmth.

1136
01:59:55,688 --> 01:59:59,150
His ideas really warm you
right to the heart.

1137
02:00:02,361 --> 02:00:03,446
These are great.

1138
02:00:03,946 --> 02:00:05,114
It's so like you too.

1139
02:00:05,781 --> 02:00:08,326
Do you know a girl like her?

1140
02:00:12,121 --> 02:00:14,540
No, just a coincidence.

1141
02:00:15,541 --> 02:00:16,375
I see.

1142
02:00:17,168 --> 02:00:20,254
I like how she's gotten out
of her wheelchair.

1143
02:00:20,338 --> 02:00:21,756
Yes. It's great.

1144
02:00:21,839 --> 02:00:25,092
And just look at her smile.
Such a big smile.

1145
02:00:41,067 --> 02:00:42,777
What a waste.

1146
02:00:43,277 --> 02:00:44,612
What the…

1147
02:00:45,613 --> 02:00:48,866
Hey! Get more liquor!

1148
02:00:55,373 --> 02:00:56,540
Akira?

1149
02:00:57,833 --> 02:00:59,168
Where did you go?

1150
02:00:59,961 --> 02:01:02,964
Akira! Where are you?

1151
02:01:26,070 --> 02:01:29,740
<i>Burn this letter after you've read it.</i>

1152
02:01:31,033 --> 02:01:35,204
<i>I think I understand the difference
between our places in society.</i>

1153
02:01:36,998 --> 02:01:40,668
<i>Four years ago, I was crying in that car.</i>

1154
02:01:41,627 --> 02:01:44,297
<i>It was what I deserved
for always running away from home</i>

1155
02:01:44,380 --> 02:01:46,966
-<i>and not trying to understand my parents.</i>
-Let go!

1156
02:01:47,591 --> 02:01:49,885
-<i>It is entirely my fault.</i>
-Hinako!

1157
02:01:52,388 --> 02:01:54,682
<i>I was also raised
by overprotective parents.</i>

1158
02:01:54,765 --> 02:01:57,685
<i>It all started
when I rebelled and ran away.</i>

1159
02:01:58,686 --> 02:02:01,105
<i>It's what I get for knowing
nothing of the world.</i>

1160
02:02:02,732 --> 02:02:05,985
<i>Then, on that day, if you hadn't shown up,</i>

1161
02:02:06,736 --> 02:02:09,071
<i>I would've been sold to a whorehouse.</i>

1162
02:02:09,905 --> 02:02:10,865
<i>That's why…</i>

1163
02:02:12,366 --> 02:02:14,702
<i>I have never held a grudge against you.</i>

1164
02:02:16,912 --> 02:02:21,083
<i>Now that I know the whole story,
I have nothing but appreciation for you.</i>

1165
02:02:23,753 --> 02:02:26,005
<i>I do have one favor to ask.</i>

1166
02:02:27,673 --> 02:02:30,843
<i>In six months, I will be walking.</i>

1167
02:02:31,719 --> 02:02:32,970
<i>I'm sure of it.</i>

1168
02:02:34,347 --> 02:02:36,474
Wait! I'm…

1169
02:02:42,688 --> 02:02:44,357
I'm going to picture it.

1170
02:02:44,440 --> 02:02:46,150
<i>Not pray, but picture it.</i>

1171
02:02:50,696 --> 02:02:52,531
From the flow of blood in my veins…

1172
02:02:55,618 --> 02:02:57,286
to the nerves and muscles…

1173
02:03:06,712 --> 02:03:08,464
and even the shifting of my weight.

1174
02:03:12,551 --> 02:03:14,887
<i>The physical therapy that you taught me.</i>

1175
02:03:16,555 --> 02:03:18,349
<i>Just like you taught me…</i>

1176
02:03:19,683 --> 02:03:21,310
<i>I'll picture it every day.</i>

1177
02:03:24,855 --> 02:03:29,193
<i>And in six months,
I'm sure it'll be around summer…</i>

1178
02:03:29,693 --> 02:03:34,532
<i>I want you to imagine a little…
about me walking.</i>

1179
02:03:41,163 --> 02:03:42,248
Sato…

1180
02:03:44,458 --> 02:03:45,459
Thank you.

1181
02:03:48,462 --> 02:03:51,298
<i>Even if you'll only have
a few memories of me…</i>

1182
02:03:53,426 --> 02:03:56,011
<i>I want them to be
of me standing on my own feet.</i>

1183
02:04:18,242 --> 02:04:19,785
<i>When what you imagine…</i>

1184
02:04:21,287 --> 02:04:23,372
<i>and my reality overlap…</i>

1185
02:04:24,540 --> 02:04:25,833
<i>I have a feeling…</i>

1186
02:04:26,917 --> 02:04:28,794
<i>that we'll meet again.</i>

1187
02:04:30,629 --> 02:04:32,006
<i>Farewell.</i>

1188
02:04:33,299 --> 02:04:34,425
<i>Take care of yourself.</i>

1189
02:04:37,219 --> 02:04:38,304
<i>Hinako Saba.</i>

1190
02:10:56,932 --> 02:11:00,894
<i>Again? I know you time it
when I'm making dinner.</i>

1191
02:11:00,978 --> 02:11:02,271
<i>Just a coincidence.</i>

1192
02:11:02,771 --> 02:11:05,941
<i>It's </i>monjayaki<i> today?</i>

1193
02:11:06,024 --> 02:11:07,818
<i>It's </i>okonomiyaki<i>!</i>

1194
