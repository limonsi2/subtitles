00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:54,220
The private Hyakkaou academy

5
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,100
It was founded more than a hundred years ago.

6
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,650
There are many children from powerful people in the political and business world.

7
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:08,990
However, there is a popular event at the school.

8
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,570
It's gambling.

9
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,680
What you need in gambling is strategy, mind reading and decisive ability.

10
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,870
Member of the student council 1st year
Itsuki Sumeragi

11
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,300
Determination.

12
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,630
Shut up!

13
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,530
Young lady...

14
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,920
-Hurry up.   -I told you to shut up!

15
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,640
Are you sure?

16
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,190
It's decreasing right?

17
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:55,920
Huh? That's my account!

18
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,730
Why is my balance decreasing!?

19
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:00,120
A hacker? How did you do it!?

20
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,840
Through my Papa's power.

21
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,280
No way...

22
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,190
Stop that right now!

23
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,210
Stop it!

24
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:12,980
Hey, please stop it! I'm begging you! Can you hear me?

25
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,440
The beautiful colors are gradually becoming black.

26
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,640
Stop that right now!

27
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,180
Please...

28
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,790
Stop it...

29
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,320
I lost...

30
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,900
Just stop it already...

31
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,560
It's pure black...

32
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,780
Hey...

33
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,660
Where is Jabami Yumeko?

34
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:02,680
Jabami Yumeko

35
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,360
2nd year Hana class
Jabami Yumeko

36
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:05,420
2nd year Hana class

37
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,370
Sink or swim!

38
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,110
I want it, I want it...

39
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,760
It's like a flame that can't be extinguished.

40
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,240
If possible come down.

41
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,450
I'm not sick of this!

42
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,090
Sink or swim!

43
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,740
No thank you for right now!

44
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:20,790
Seize the day!

45
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,530
Punishment or money?

46
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,130
Dive and be ambitious!

47
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:33,120
Let's bet on these glowing dice tomorrow!

48
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,000
Igarashi Sayaka.  Student council 2nd year.

49
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,580
Yumemite Yumemi.  Student council 2nd year.

50
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,950
Ikishima Midari.  Student council 2nd year.

51
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,560
Nishinotouin Yuriko.  Student council 3rd year.

52
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,000
Yomozuki Runa.  Student council 3rd year.

53
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,150
Vice president.  Student council 3rd year.

54
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:21,000
Momobami Kirari.  Student council president 3rd year.

55
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:27,900
Gambling at Hyakkaou academy is everything.

56
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:34,320
What you need is strategy, mind reading and decisive ability.

57
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,100
-Also...  -Money!

58
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,290
Those are all elements of becoming successful in the future.

59
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,770
The student council manages the gambling.

60
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,340
And the students pay fees.

61
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,520
In order to make this system deeply rooted into people's hearts...

62
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,830
We have strengthened the collection of casino usage fees and deposits.

63
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,770
It's the casino enforcement!

64
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,680
Get out of here!

65
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,660
I'm  the student council!

66
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:10,460
You guys are unforgivable for skipping out on fees!

67
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,680
Shit! The bullets are stuck!

68
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,160
Hey! Don't let them run away!

69
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,680
In addition, the ranking list is released every month.

70
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:24,190
And the top 100 non-cooperative students become housepets.

71
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,860
Again! Again!

72
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,560
Shoe shine!

73
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,920
Do you hear me stupid dog?

74
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:39,790
The class system created by the president works perfectly.

75
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,110
The power of the student council is solid as a rock.

76
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,580
Is that really the case?

77
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,610
Is that really the case?

78
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,340
Is that true?

79
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,080
Please fight me in a class battle!

80
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,480
I'm scared!

81
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,210
More and more people want to try their luck in class battles!

82
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:13,120
It's true that the class battle is a right granted solely to housepets.

83
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,140
You can request an unlimited amount of battles against the student council.

84
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,800
Nishinotouin-sama!

85
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,400
It's not safe here! Please run away!

86
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,780
How rude to treat the student council members this way!

87
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:32,010
Class battles are a special case that take precedence over all rules!

88
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:35,500
You have no right to refuse!

89
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,500
It's never been like this!

90
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,010
Don't run away!

91
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,410
So disgusting! Gross housepets!

92
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,360
Is that really the case?

93
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,560
Everything started with Jabami Yumeko.

94
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,680
Nishinotouin Yuriko.

95
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,460
Ikishima Midari.

96
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,280
Yumemite Yumemiko.

97
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,360
Manyuda Kaede.

98
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,260
More than half of the student council lost to Jabami Yumeko.

99
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,260
And furthermore there was the turmoil in the student representative election.

100
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:20,370
The impact of these things damaged the student council.

101
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,780
Jabami Yumeko.

102
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,430
It's her fault!

103
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,500
It's the woman's fault!

104
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,160
That woman...that woman!

105
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,140
That woman!

106
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,920
She might be revolutionary.

107
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:42,540
Or is she just a gambling fanatic?

108
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:48,250
What is this?

109
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,960
Jabami Yumeko...

110
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,360
Yumeko isn't doing well!

111
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,540
What's wrong Yumeko?

112
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,420
There's only one reason why gambling isn't enough!

113
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,020
That's not it...

114
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,120
She wants to gamble with the president!

115
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,120
That's not it!

116
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,950
Yumeko!

117
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:29,870
I'll treat you to a yummy dessert!

118
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,120
No thank you!

119
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,140
I have money.

120
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,560
3...3 billion!?

121
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,420
Manyuda-san paid me.

122
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:55,050
This is farewell for you.

123
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,020
Umm...

124
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,920
If you have 3 billion yen then why are you depressed?

125
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,670
Because...

126
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:20,240
A sports meeting is going to be held...

127
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,320
Huh? That?

128
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:26,230
Do you like sport games Suzui-san?

129
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,630
Yes!

130
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,770
Is that so?

131
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:35,410
Are you one of them? If that's the case then I won't talk to you anymore!

132
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:36,240
Why?

133
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,960
Saotome!

134
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,650
Where is Saotome?

135
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,110
Saotome! Saotome!

136
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,250
Look for her! Saotome! Saotome!

137
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,970
Saotome! What's wrong?

138
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,240
-Suzui!  -Yes!

139
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,360
Janken po!

140
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,430
Po!

141
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,200
That's a hit!

142
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,620
Alright!

143
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,470
Why? Why can't I even beat Suzui?

144
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:15,100
Mary-san! What's wrong?

145
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:19,330
It's so weird! I've been so unlucky recently!

146
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:22,520
Why did it turn out like this!?

147
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,940
The other day, Kiwatari and I made some money.

148
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:32,270
Then I destroyed him in gambling again!

149
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,720
It's the final hit!

150
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,210
Stop it! I'm begging you!

151
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:49,590
Sorry! It's so lame! How lame!

152
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,570
My hair!!!

153
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,300
I'll remember this!!

154
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:05,250
I was fine at that time...

155
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,770
-A pair!   -Single!

156
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,700
-Single!  -Pair!

157
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,360
-Pair!  -Single!

158
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:21,780
What the hell?

159
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,200
I won!

160
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,370
It's a royal flush!

161
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:29,260
Take a bet!

162
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,580
I take a bet!

163
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,640
I'm the student council!

164
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,160
You guys are unforgivable for owing money!

165
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,440
Hold on!

166
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,330
I won! I won!

167
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:45,220
This is definitely strange! Weird! Did I do something?

168
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,490
No way...

169
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,110
You got the house pet curse?

170
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,210
No way...that's not true!

171
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,130
What is that?

172
00:12:55,230 --> 00:13:01,110
When you get the housepet curse then you'll slowly start losing money...

173
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:06,110
Then in the end you'll become a housepet!

174
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,010
Stop it!

175
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:10,040
And this curse will be contagious!

176
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:16,740
Half of the students become housepets a year ago...

177
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,660
How scary!

178
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:24,010
That's just a campus urban legend!

179
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,400
It's true!

180
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,800
Uchima-kun...

181
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:39,100
You look pretty bad.

182
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,720
Shall we go?

183
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:45,480
You pioneer!

184
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:46,690
Hold on!

185
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:50,520
If you don't have money you can work to pay off your debt!

186
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,020
Let's go Pioneer!

187
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,930
You'll work 16 hours a day in an accommodation system!

188
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:04,420
After deducting various expenses such as work clothes and tool rentals... It'll be 1850 yen a day!

189
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:11,480
I happen to have a job at the sports meeting now!

190
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,700
I will pay it back...

191
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,220
Saotome-san!

192
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:22,430
You are struck by the curse...

193
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,140
No!!!

194
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,640
Saotome-san!

195
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:31,060
Mary-san is amazing...

196
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,490
She runs really fast!

197
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,400
What about the ranking?

198
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,600
It's almost unchanged from last month.

199
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,540
Also, the amount of students with nothing is increasing.

200
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,880
There might be more than 100 housepets...

201
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,680
It's the curse of the housepet huh?

202
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,920
How scary!

203
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,780
The culprit of all of this is Jabami Yumeko.

204
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,320
Yumeko!

205
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,770
-I want to gamble against her...  -Ikishima-san!

206
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:15,220
I think it's necessary to take measures against Jabami Yumeko as soon as possible!

207
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:36,100
It's already started right?

208
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,680
Yumemi.

209
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,500
Way to go president!

210
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,610
I can't hide anything from you!

211
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,720
What? What?

212
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,860
The measure to deal with Yumeko-chan is...

213
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:57,650
Finding a better gambler than her!

214
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,380
Like I said...

215
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:06,000
Let me call the legendary gambler who can defeat Yumeko-chan!

216
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Come in!

217
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,710
Ew!

218
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,800
Who?

219
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:22,180
Do you know who he is?

220
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:52,060
Are you in a bad mood?

221
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,120
Long time no see.

222
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,480
Shikigami Makuro...

223
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,950
What happened?

224
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,620
I disappeared...

225
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,140
You were suspended from school 2 years ago.

226
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,260
Suspended?

227
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,060
Because he ruined the school once!

228
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,430
For real?

229
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,600
I told Yumemite-san about him.

230
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,680
That's right!

231
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,400
Dealing with Jabami Yumeko is a high-risk gamble.

232
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,760
So we must have the consciousness to take the corresponding risks.

233
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,330
President.

234
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:40,720
Can you please formally order Shikigami Makuro to defeat Jabami Yumeko?

235
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,340
You can't!

236
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,480
Do as you please.

237
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,480
President!

238
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,690
What should I do?

239
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:59,520
Please defeat Jabami Yumeko completely!

240
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,640
And take back the 3 billion yen in her hands.

241
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,180
Even if Jabami Yumeko dies?

242
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,000
I don't mind.

243
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,800
If I destroy Jabami Yumeko...

244
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:20,860
I hope to officially return to school.

245
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,930
We will prepare the funds as much as possible.

246
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,930
I don't need money.

247
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,430
Also...

248
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:37,420
I ask that we take care of Saotome Mary and Sumeragi Itsuki please.

249
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,640
Also, Suzui-kun!

250
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,150
There's no need!

251
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,800
He's just a passerby!

252
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:47,060
Lady Sumeragi has already been destroyed.

253
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,700
I'll just paint Saotome Mary in black.

254
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,290
And Jabami Yumeko will appear.

255
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,490
Shikigami Makuro!

256
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,650
He's not a cute legend!

257
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,160
He's a monster!

258
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,640
Now, now, now!

259
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,300
This is a pioneering place for hopes and dreams!

260
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,900
Let's sing the song of the pioneers!

261
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,610
Where's Yumeko?

262
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:37,220
She said she won't show up until the sports meeting starts...

263
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,260
What the heck?

264
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,520
Saotome!

265
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,910
What if you ask Yumeko?

266
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,460
There's no need!

267
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,380
I can't rely on her!

268
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:03,940
Hey! Wanna get on? There's still room!

269
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,200
No thank you!

270
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,080
You have been cursed after all!

271
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:19,540
Saotome!

272
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,150
Saotome senpai!

273
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:28,260
Tsumeragi!

274
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,930
Don't you want money?

275
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,130
I want it!

276
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:35,320
Okay!

277
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,400
Hold on! Hold on!

278
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,270
This is Tsumeragi!

279
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,700
Shut up!

280
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,980
I didn't call you!

281
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:46,220
Saotome senpai!

282
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,640
There's someone who really wants you to beat him!

283
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,560
Sure!

284
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,340
Sorry Tsumeragi but I don't have any assets!

285
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,620
-You sure are cursed huh?  -Pretty much!

286
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,860
I will lend you all of my assets!

287
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,570
Sounds good!

288
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,850
Is this him?

289
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,250
Yes...

290
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,880
He's Shikigami.

291
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:21,310
Saotome Mary...

292
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,100
You're pretty beautiful huh?

293
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,260
Pretty much.

294
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,180
You are?

295
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,290
A passerby...

296
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,300
Let's start this thing.

297
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,130
What kind of gamble is it?

298
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,280
It's a simple gamble.

299
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,460
However...

300
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,800
It's not me who will gamble with you.

301
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,880
He will.

302
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,100
Who is that?

303
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,590
The participation fee is 1 million yen.

304
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:01,000
If you win, I'll give you 10 million yen.

305
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:02,740
10 million yen!?

306
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,260
However if you lose...

307
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:12,790
This housepet badge is going to be put on you instead!

308
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:16,830
You're telling me to be a housepet instead of him?

309
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,840
No Saotome! Being a housepet is a no go!

310
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,740
Take it easy!

311
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:26,730
Even if you become a housepet you only need to pay 1 million yen deposits in order to be released.

312
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,260
In other words...

313
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:33,760
You take a risk of 2 million but can gain 10 million yen!

314
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,710
What gain do you have?

315
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,860
You don't trust me?

316
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,440
Or are you scared of becoming a housepet?

317
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,940
Let's do this.

318
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:49,130
-Saotome! -Let's go!

319
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:54,500
It's begun fading.

320
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:01,930
Duel*Dice*Stacking

321
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:04,170
Let me explain rules.
Duel*Dice*Stacking

322
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:04,260
Duel*Dice*Stacking

323
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:08,140
There's the size of the 4 stacked dice.

324
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:12,480
It's the number of points on the top set times the number of layers stacked.

325
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,340
3 points times 2 layers is 6 points.

326
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:18,150
If you don't put it up then it's 0 points.

327
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,850
The person with more points wins.

328
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,020
Two wins in three games.

329
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,740
Begin.

330
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:28,060
Saotome.

331
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,810
Open.

332
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,440
Amazing!

333
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,230
Saotome, 12 points.

334
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,560
You can do it Saotome!

335
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,150
Way to go! She can win!

336
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:54,590
Don't be careless!

337
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,620
If he rolls 6 points and 2 layers then it will be a tie.

338
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:03,230
-Negimida  -Yes!

339
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,980
Open.

340
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:28,920
Negimida has 0 points.

341
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,020
Saotome wins.

342
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,800
Alright! Alright! You just need one more win!

343
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,100
I won right?

344
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,390
Have I been freed from the curse?

345
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,310
What are you doing?

346
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,340
No! No! I don't want to die!

347
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,400
Keep betting!

348
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,970
Huh? What does he mean?

349
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,020
If I lose...

350
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,480
Then I will jump out of the window!

351
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:01,020
Aww...they found out.

352
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:04,850
Mary-san. Don't worry about it and keep betting!

353
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,170
What the hell?

354
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:15,020
Are you having me get involved in your bullying?

355
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,440
How foolish!

356
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,570
H-Hold on!

357
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:21,060
Are you going to quit in the middle of it?

358
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,700
This isn't gambling!

359
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,020
Even if you win it's meaningless!

360
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,930
Are you leaving?

361
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:29,050
Damn right!

362
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,580
Hold on!

363
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:33,200
No helping it.

364
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,140
Jump.

365
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,810
I didn't lose!

366
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,400
Stop it!

367
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,040
I'm sorry!

368
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,850
Does this make you happy?

369
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,240
I will continue to bet with you!

370
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,220
Shit!

371
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:05,700
-Tsumeragi! -Yes?

372
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,020
Sorry but give me 2 million yen!

373
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,870
Hold on! Are you planning on losing?

374
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:19,970
Although it fucking pisses me off, it's better than regretting it afterwards!

375
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,160
I can't...

376
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,020
Why not!?

377
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,720
Didn't you say that you'd give her all your assets?

378
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:31,020
This is all I have...

379
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,980
Zero!?

380
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,140
You deceived me?

381
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,840
I didn't say any lies...

382
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,260
Choose Saotome Mary!

383
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,430
Will this guy jump?

384
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:57,660
Will you become a housepet?

385
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,050
How foolish!

386
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:18,370
You're trying to make me scared so I can lose?

387
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,960
It's just a bluff isn't it?

388
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:27,180
Saotome!

389
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,620
It's your fault.

390
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,740
No...

391
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:10,660
It's your fault! It's your fault! It's your fault!

392
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:27,180
I've actually been cursed...

393
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,740
Suzui.

394
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,580
Go buy some juice.

395
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:45,630
-What are you saying Saotome?  -Hurry up damn it!

396
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,700
Get out.

397
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,690
Saotome! What are you planning on doing?

398
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,460
You can't Saotome! Saotome!

399
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:04,020
Saotome! Saotome! Saotome!

400
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,830
Saotome!

401
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,080
There.

402
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,380
This is fine right?

403
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,550
What?

404
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,000
You want me to do it one more time?

405
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:54,400
You still have some color left.

406
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,700
You're jumping.

407
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,790
Stop it!

408
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:02,510
Saotome!

409
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,280
Stop it!

410
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,230
-Saotome! -Let me go!

411
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,790
You fucking bastard!

412
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,890
Listen up.

413
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:32,140
Say "I lost please forgive me."

414
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,780
Say it house bitch!

415
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,380
Saotome!

416
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,920
Saotome!

417
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,600
Saotome!

418
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:47,640
Saotome! Saotome!

419
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,900
Saotome!

420
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,650
Saotome!

421
00:30:54,130 --> 00:31:02,340
Saotome! Saotome! Saotome! Saotome!

422
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,580
I...

423
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,540
Lost...

424
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:23,820
Please forgive me...

425
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:59,080
He killed her...

426
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,030
Amazing...

427
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,810
I'm better than him!

428
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:17,080
The student council has an announcement.

429
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,620
Jabami Yumeko-san...

430
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,380
Jabami Yumeko-san...

431
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:33,890
I destroyed Tsumeragi Itsuki and Saotome Mary!

432
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:36,720
Come on over Jabami Yumeko!

433
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,740
I'm going to destroy you!

434
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:54,210
Very well done. Now all that's left is Jabami Yumeko.

435
00:32:55,380 --> 00:33:01,330
I want to be sure that no matter what happens, it's the responsibility of the student council.

436
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,960
What are you planning on doing?

437
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,880
Hold on Man in black! Yumeko is mine!

438
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:17,380
What are you planning on doing with a gun that has no bullets?

439
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:30,720
This is my gun.

440
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,240
I have bullets too.

441
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:35,090
The president gave me that!

442
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:37,380
It's mine originally.

443
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:42,230
Right?

444
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:55,980
Shikigami Makuro is indefinitely suspended from this school.

445
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,750
Farewell.

446
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,180
Shikigami.

447
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:13,770
I thought that we'd get along.

448
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:21,160
I don't want it!

449
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:29,310
Shikigami.

450
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:36,540
Jabami Yumeko won't come because of that broadcast.

451
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:48,360
What is that?

452
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,620
An invitation card.

453
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:58,080
Extra! Extra!

454
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,430
The Saotome fiasco!

455
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:06,350
The student council's assassin Shikigami Makuro has declared war on Jabami Yumeko!

456
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:09,940
Extra! Extra!

457
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,430
Get on board!

458
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:35,460
I was waiting for you.

459
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,920
Yumeko!

460
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:49,360
Saotome is going away on the truck!

461
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,300
Yumeko!

462
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,960
Save Saotome!

463
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,270
I don't have time for that.

464
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:07,580
Furthermore, I don't think that Mary-san wants that.

465
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,550
Are you going?

466
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:20,140
I mean...it's an invitation from the President.

467
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,940
It's Shikigami.

468
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,640
That's true.

469
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,790
I'm going.

470
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:00,740
Saotome!

471
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,670
Hold on!

472
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:08,040
Here! Here!

473
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,570
Saotome!

474
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,020
Saotome!

475
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,810
I've been thinking of ways to make you show up.

476
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:56,340
If you're looking to gamble then I'm up for it at any time.

477
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,120
Excuse me! Excuse me!

478
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,000
Yumeko!

479
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:04,100
Alright! It's started!

480
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,280
It's a game where we bet everything.

481
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:11,980
Your 3 billion yen.

482
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,800
I also prepared the same amount.

483
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:19,220
I also prepared the same amount.

484
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,870
However you just said "Everything".

485
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,260
Say it.

486
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:33,320
If you lose...

487
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:39,940
You will leave Hyakkaou academy and never come back.

488
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:47,070
Are you sure about that?

489
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:52,120
I'm sure about it.

490
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,220
Then if you lose...

491
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,760
I'll steal gambling from you.

492
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:08,230
He'll steal gambling from Yumeko!?

493
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:16,660
We're betting on each other's existence...

494
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,140
How exciting.

495
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:32,420
This is where Jabami Yumeko ends.

496
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:40,980
This is 3 billion yen worth of chips.

497
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,480
The gambling game is...

498
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:48,600
Black Texas Hold'em.

499
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:52,500
You only use clubs and spades cards.

500
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,200
There is only one pair or two pairs.

501
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,360
No flush or straights.

502
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:01,320
The rest is the same as the ordinary Texas Hold'em.

503
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,430
It's fairly simple and straightforward rules.

504
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:10,720
Decisive victory or defeat is the most fun to play with bare hands.

505
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:14,140
T-Texas Hold'em?

506
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:17,860
Passerby, are you stupid?

507
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:18,980
Tsumeragi!

508
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:21,730
Texas Hold'em is the most mainstream type of poker in this world!

509
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,910
Each player is dealt two hole cards.

510
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:29,480
At this point each player decides to bet or not.

511
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,660
Then they will turn over the three community on the table.

512
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:36,460
Then match those community cards with the cards in your hand.

513
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:38,350
Repeat the same thing.

514
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:41,740
Then it's a showdown after turning over the fourth and fifth community cards.

515
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:44,470
The player with the bigger card wins.

516
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:51,780
It goes Ace, King, and Queen as the strongest cards. Even a small citizen would understand right?

517
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:56,680
Jabami senpai! Please beat him and get back my money!

518
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,880
You betrayed us right? Right?

519
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:05,220
Round 1.

520
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,430
What will you do?

521
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,060
I bet 300 million.

522
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:20,670
3...300 million!?

523
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:22,670
That much!?

524
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:33,260
You're beautiful...Jabami Yumeko.

525
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,860
I call!

526
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,720
Shikigami-san...

527
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:52,270
What do your eyes see?

528
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,980
What I see is the color of desire.

529
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:04,100
A human's desire is their heart. Once you master it then nobody can violate it.

530
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:08,500
What kind of color am I?

531
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:25,980
I've only met one other person with a color like yours.

532
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:33,920
No matter what you see, it's just a mystery right?

533
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:37,320
Right?

534
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:43,060
Although you disguise yourself as a monster...

535
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:48,190
You have carefully laid everything out.

536
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:52,080
The correct analogy is like hunting with traps and poison.

537
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,680
Did you just compare people to bugs?

538
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,520
It's a compliment.

539
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:02,360
Countless prey have been caught in your lair.

540
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:06,500
I raise 300 million.

541
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:16,140
Your first prey were Nishinotouin-san and Yumemite-san?

542
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:19,300
Huh? Yumemi?

543
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:22,780
I call.

544
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:28,530
In the beginning you knotted the two of them.

545
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:30,640
Please have a class battle with me!

546
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:32,530
How scary!

547
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:33,380
Battle!

548
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,630
It has never been this bad!

549
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:41,700
You drove the two of them into a desperate situation and had them trap themselves right?

550
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:44,930
Thank you!

551
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,840
Please leave it to me!

552
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,200
Class battle!

553
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:53,230
You have no right to refuse!

554
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:55,430
Run away Nishitouin-san!

555
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:59,480
They were poisoned unknowingly...

556
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:02,020
And then they summoned you.

557
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:04,220
The black sinner!

558
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:08,500
Do you have any idea who that is?

559
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:10,820
President.

560
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:15,980
Can you please formally order Shikigami Makurou to defeat Jabami Yumeko?

561
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,640
That's not true! I...

562
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:25,960
You even used the news club to incite the students.

563
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,520
And you upset the student council.

564
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,880
What is this?

565
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:36,260
No! I just wrote what I wanted to write!

566
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:46,950
He just wrote what he wanted to write.

567
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:57,030
Your strategy is to lure your prey into a snare.

568
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:02,310
You used Tsumeragi-san to trick Mary-san.

569
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:04,870
That's really clever.

570
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:08,970
It's a very smart strategy.

571
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:13,770
It's just not in line with my liking.

572
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:19,070
I raise 400 million for a total of 1 billion.

573
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:27,360
1 billion!?

574
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,360
Way to go!

575
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:31,720
I call.

576
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:35,940
Showdown.

577
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:43,560
Yumeko!

578
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,150
She has a pair of 2!

579
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:46,080
And Shikigami?

580
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,620
He doesn't have one! It's Jabami senpai's win!

581
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:52,190
1 billion...

582
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:55,200
Yumeko-chan is amazing...

583
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:07,350
The biggest card is just a guise. You won in pairs with the smallest card.

584
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,540
Is this a gambling fanatic?

585
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:17,140
If you play cards according to common sense, you won't win.

586
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:24,620
I don't know why the student council specifically targeted you.

587
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:27,220
Why were you suspended from school?

588
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,760
Why do you think I was?

589
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,800
Shikigami...

590
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:02,590
Are there fireworks going on?

591
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:09,940
Let's continue!

592
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:13,170
You gambling fanatic.

593
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,280
Round 2.

594
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:38,380
Was that the data storage room in the north school building that exploded?

595
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:42,540
Why do you think that?

596
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:50,040
My cards being paired was the condition of the explosion.

597
00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:56,060
The special arrangement of the cards here...

598
00:47:56,180 --> 00:48:00,940
Represent the direction of the explosion. East, West, South, and north.

599
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:02,760
What? What?

600
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:04,030
What?

601
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:13,100
And the numbers 1 through 13 indicate classrooms and facilities from here.

602
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:15,640
What about the fifth card?

603
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:19,530
The center.

604
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:21,370
Is it here?

605
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:24,090
What happens if you pair with the card in your hand?

606
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:26,560
I don't know.

607
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,900
It's 6 times 13.

608
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:34,510
78 locations may explode.

609
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:38,960
As long as Jabami senpai has a pair there will be a place to explode...

610
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,820
Holy crap! Holy crap! Get out of here everyone!

611
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:46,220
-Where should we go?  -Shut up!

612
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,860
I'm a monster huh?

613
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:55,790
Will you fold?

614
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:02,990
What great courage.

615
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:12,340
Library on the 4th floor of West building one.

616
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:20,920
The second grade class in the South teaching building.

617
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:28,160
The hall of building number 2.

618
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:31,200
The hall of building number 2.

619
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,010
The hall of building number 2?

620
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:38,640
It's here! Run away! Run away!

621
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:59,480
The tool room on the 5th floor of building number 9.

622
00:50:01,590 --> 00:50:05,140
People's lives are at stake here!

623
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:15,850
I raise 900 million.

624
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:18,500
1 billion in total.

625
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:23,160
-She raised to 1 billion? -It's Yumeko's win!

626
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:27,580
-Where will it explode? Where?  -Shut up!

627
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,240
I call.

628
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:36,030
Showdown.

629
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:39,300
Now then!

630
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:43,530
Prove your reasoning.

631
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,310
Okay.

632
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:52,000
It's called a vacant building.

633
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:54,620
So it's fine.

634
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:08,850
What the hell is going on?

635
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:15,960
Are you satisfied with my answers?

636
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:20,960
You really are an uncute woman.

637
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:30,850
Jabami senpai just won 2 billion!

638
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:32,210
She'll win!

639
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:36,080
Round 3.

640
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:54,210
100 million.

641
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:10,200
First year Chinese class in West building one.

642
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:15,910
The sports preparation warehouse on the south side.

643
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:18,760
Well...

644
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:21,640
There is a pair of Kings...

645
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:25,280
The sports warehouse will explode huh?

646
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:28,360
You look happy.

647
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:37,960
If it explodes then the sports meeting will be canceled is all I'm thinking.

648
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:42,310
There's nobody there right now.

649
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:56,530
The indoor swimming pool.

650
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:03,450
If that explodes too then the sports meeting is done right?

651
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,020
I raise to one billion.

652
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,180
1 billion!

653
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:16,070
She'll destroy him!

654
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:23,370
You're obviously bluffing!

655
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:27,910
Do you have a Queen?

656
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:39,630
Who knows...

657
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:42,100
I wonder?

658
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,680
I call.

659
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:02,540
I've been waiting!

660
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,980
Additional chips.

661
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:14,550
All in. This is 5 billion yen worth of chips.

662
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:19,270
Extra?

663
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:20,380
He can do that?

664
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:27,540
This is bad! If he has an Ace then he can create an Ace and King pair, the strongest one!

665
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:37,580
This is everything that I have.

666
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:45,830
Now then, how about you disappear?

667
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:52,180
All in!

668
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:56,570
Showdown!

669
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,720
What's wrong?

670
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:28,740
The sports warehouse is going to explode.

671
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,480
Now! Now! Now!

672
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:41,460
Let's fall into the gambling abyss together Jabami Yumeko!

673
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:45,840
What's wrong? It's a 5 billion yen showdown Jabami Yumeko!

674
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:49,900
You have a Queen right? Then it's your win because I don't have an Ace!

675
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:55,160
I'll disappear alongside the sports warehouse!

676
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:01,920
Jabami Yumeko!

677
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:05,920
You've become the color that I love!

678
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:11,530
Pure black! The color of despair!

679
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:17,460
Listen up, Your beautiful desires are mixed with despair!

680
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:20,860
Your colors are slowly getting darker and will finally turn pure black!

681
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:23,180
Once you turn black you can't turn back!

682
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:29,770
It will be soon! Go for it Jabami Yumeko! Showdown!

683
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:59,340
I lost...

684
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:44,500
The gambling fanatic has lost...

685
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:55,700
Just like we promised, we officially welcome you back to the school.

686
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:02,520
You have my thanks.

687
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:07,100
However...it's not enough.

688
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:11,530
There's one more thing that I want.

689
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:14,480
What is it?

690
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:20,900
That seat.

691
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24,520
I can't stand him!

692
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,780
Give me that seat!

693
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,590
How rude! We can't accept that!

694
00:58:33,090 --> 00:58:36,360
Are you sure about that?

695
00:58:36,810 --> 00:58:38,500
No way...

696
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:43,220
Yumemite-san! Nishinotouin-san!

697
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:45,540
Please wake up!

698
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:52,160
Little girl! You're neutral right?

699
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,500
Pretty much...

700
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:57,320
Shit!

701
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:00,250
You and the Mask...

702
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:03,350
You guys can't beat the rest of the council.

703
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:06,040
Let me replace her.

704
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,890
Don't screw with me!

705
00:59:07,990 --> 00:59:10,330
Gamble with me!

706
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:12,430
If I win...

707
00:59:12,570 --> 00:59:17,710
You will be permanently expelled from Hyakkaou Academy.

708
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:24,640
What are you betting?

709
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:32,210
My life!

710
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:41,040
Does she know who I am?

711
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:47,090
Let's make a deal.

712
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:56,680
Farewell.

713
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:59,060
Shikigami.

714
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:12,210
Hold on to this gun for me.

715
01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:16,240
When I come back...

716
01:00:18,370 --> 01:00:20,880
Use this bullet.

717
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:34,420
I'll kill you.

718
01:00:50,470 --> 01:00:52,190
Sayaka.

719
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,980
You lost.

720
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,460
President...

721
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:00,550
Shikigami Makurou.

722
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:04,120
As the price of misconduct...

723
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:06,800
I'll give that seat to you.

724
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:12,410
Also...

725
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:16,100
You can turn me into a housepet or whatever you want.

726
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:17,700
President!

727
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:21,350
Momobami Kirari.

728
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:25,130
There's something else you need to say.

729
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:37,140
Please...

730
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:49,080
It was only half 2 years ago.

731
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:51,900
Now it will be everyone!

732
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:57,980
I will turn your beautiful fish tank into pure black!

733
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:02,260
Hyakkaou academy collapsed.

734
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:05,320
We are near the official handover ceremony of the student council president.

735
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:08,040
Shikigami changed the rules of the school.

736
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:10,040
All the students...

737
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:12,960
We have amended the Houspet law.

738
01:02:13,570 --> 01:02:17,680
The monthly payments will be 100 million yen.

739
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:19,620
100 million?

740
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:23,720
The non-cooperative students will turn into Housepets.

741
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,780
Everyone is going to become a housepet!

742
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:31,480
The housepet curse was Shikigami...

743
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:33,340
That's right.

744
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:37,430
2 years ago half of the students became housepets.

745
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:41,380
The man who created the Housepet curse urban legend...

746
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:49,040
Will now turn everyone into housepets and create despair.

747
01:02:57,620 --> 01:03:00,120
I don't know what to say to her.

748
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:06,990
Yumeko's existence of gambling was stolen from her by Shikigami.

749
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:10,400
What will she do now?

750
01:03:10,850 --> 01:03:12,960
Suzui-san...

751
01:03:20,230 --> 01:03:21,920
What is it?

752
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:25,270
What should I do?

753
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:28,680
Yumeko...

754
01:03:35,230 --> 01:03:39,220
The sports meeting wasn't canceled!

755
01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:45,280
Now that the school has become this way, it would be natural to cancel it right?

756
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:50,240
I'll write a letter to Mary-san!

757
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:56,540
I'll tell her to mess up the preparations for the meeting so that they can cancel it!

758
01:03:56,540 --> 01:04:02,120
Is the sports warehouse cold over there?

759
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:19,090
The light is lost...

760
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:25,680
Winter is coming...

761
01:04:26,690 --> 01:04:33,500
The icy wings and the buried dreams.

762
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:40,520
These hands were full of hope.

763
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:48,170
I don't want to give up this life.

764
01:04:48,170 --> 01:04:54,560
I want to find my friend.

765
01:04:54,560 --> 01:05:00,090
This little light...

766
01:05:00,090 --> 01:05:08,680
Where is the warmth?

767
01:05:11,130 --> 01:05:17,020
I can't do anything...

768
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:26,860
However there's something I want to say...

769
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:30,730
-I don't want to give up.   -Don't give up.

770
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:33,990
-My life...   -Your life...

771
01:05:33,990 --> 01:05:40,640
Let's find that friend and dream once more!

772
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:43,920
-Don't give up.   -I don't want to give up.

773
01:05:43,950 --> 01:05:47,160
-Your life...  -My life...

774
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:52,880
The ring of the bell is coming.

775
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:56,700
La la la~

776
01:06:03,350 --> 01:06:09,680
The light is lost...

777
01:06:09,830 --> 01:06:15,660
Winter is coming...

778
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,380
Shikigami-san...

779
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:09,320
I came here to gamble against you.

780
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:15,240
You can longer gamble.

781
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:24,290
Mary-san.

782
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,280
Saotome!

783
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:42,900
I challenge you to a class battle.

784
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:47,370
The one who will gamble instead of me is...

785
01:10:49,650 --> 01:10:51,710
Jabami Yumeko!

786
01:10:55,220 --> 01:10:58,120
A class battle has precedence over all rules!

787
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:00,040
In other words she can gamble!

788
01:11:00,070 --> 01:11:02,350
I see!

789
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:13,440
The student council has no right to refuse.

790
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:22,920
If I win then I will return everything you have stolen.

791
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:32,860
I'll let you go first.

792
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:45,910
I challenge you to a battle.

793
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:57,880
You have no right to refuse.

794
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:00,530
Student council president.

795
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:02,220
Alright!

796
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:03,580
What will we do?

797
01:12:03,910 --> 01:12:05,400
The president too!

798
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:06,580
Yumeko and the president?

799
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:08,560
Where should I stand?

800
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:11,090
No way! Why?

801
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:29,100
The loser leaves the school.

802
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:32,310
That's fine right?

803
01:12:38,050 --> 01:12:39,610
Yes.

804
01:12:41,370 --> 01:12:43,680
I'll decide the gambling game!

805
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:45,680
This is bad...

806
01:12:45,790 --> 01:12:49,160
We will gamble in pairs.

807
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:53,360
Kirari, your partner will be...

808
01:12:53,710 --> 01:12:55,670
The secretary woman.

809
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:59,000
Don't die...

810
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:03,840
Jabami Yumeko...

811
01:13:03,870 --> 01:13:07,000
Your partner will be...

812
01:13:12,950 --> 01:13:14,520
You.

813
01:13:20,410 --> 01:13:21,810
Me!?

814
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:23,320
Why?

815
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,760
Mary-san is cursed after all.

816
01:13:28,890 --> 01:13:31,020
That pisses me off!

817
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:36,400
My partner will be...

818
01:13:38,970 --> 01:13:41,380
Me!

819
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:43,500
Ikishima-san!

820
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:48,880
I will gamble against Yumeko and the president?

821
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:51,460
That's my dream!

822
01:13:52,130 --> 01:13:53,640
Right?

823
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:56,020
Man in black.

824
01:13:58,330 --> 01:14:00,340
Let's begin.

825
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:19,660
We will now have the student council president Shikigami Makuro...

826
01:14:19,660 --> 01:14:26,570
Go against Momobami Kirari and Jabami Yumeko in a game.

827
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:33,000
Who will win?

828
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:39,870
The game is Russian Roulette.

829
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:47,620
This is what happened 2 years ago.

830
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:52,280
This is the game that created the Housepet curse?

831
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:58,930
This is a game where cards decide who shoots at whom.

832
01:14:58,930 --> 01:15:00,270
Shoot at?

833
01:15:00,270 --> 01:15:02,270
I'll explain the rules.

834
01:15:02,270 --> 01:15:05,140
There's two name cards for each person.

835
01:15:05,140 --> 01:15:07,900
One player card and one hostage card.

836
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:09,600
And bullet cards.

837
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,730
And a Bang card.

838
01:15:11,850 --> 01:15:14,100
We'll give each player a card.

839
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:15,900
And put one on each card box in the field.

840
01:15:15,990 --> 01:15:17,920
This is when the gambling begins.

841
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:20,630
The player will get another card.

842
01:15:20,630 --> 01:15:24,680
And put one of the two cards in your hand at any time.

843
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:27,410
You'll decide who will shoot whom.

844
01:15:27,410 --> 01:15:28,550
That's right.

845
01:15:28,550 --> 01:15:30,880
When you get a player card or hostage card...

846
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:34,440
All players or all hostages...

847
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:36,660
Will shoot or be shot.

848
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:39,200
There's only one bullet from the start.

849
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:42,160
You can use bullet cards to increase the ammunition.

850
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:47,000
Players will get 100 million yen for every additional bullet.

851
01:15:47,270 --> 01:15:53,190
Players who get a Bang card in this game must disclose it immediately.

852
01:15:53,190 --> 01:15:55,900
The next player gives the last card...

853
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:59,080
Then it will be Russian roulette.

854
01:15:59,590 --> 01:16:02,140
Awesome!

855
01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:05,360
Shoot according to the instructions in the box.

856
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:06,950
If there is no bullet...

857
01:16:06,950 --> 01:16:11,240
The player who is shot can get 100 million yen for each loaded bullet.

858
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:13,890
And a bonus of 500 million yen.

859
01:16:13,890 --> 01:16:15,560
There's 5 rounds in total.

860
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:18,980
The one with the most money wins.

861
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:23,650
In addition, if a player surrenders or dies before the end of the game...

862
01:16:23,650 --> 01:16:26,920
Then the last remaining person becomes the winner.

863
01:16:27,740 --> 01:16:30,840
Now then, let's begin!

864
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:37,730
Hold on! Hold on! Hold on!

865
01:16:37,730 --> 01:16:39,340
You said if someone dies!?

866
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:41,680
Are you a dumbass?

867
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:45,420
Of course someone is going to die!

868
01:16:47,730 --> 01:16:49,700
It's a real gun after all.

869
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:59,420
I can't stand you!

870
01:16:59,420 --> 01:17:01,990
Seeing you from below you're quite special!

871
01:17:01,990 --> 01:17:03,940
I'm cursed again!

872
01:17:03,940 --> 01:17:07,350
Start it up! Come on! Start it up!

873
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:18,100
Someone is gonna die!

874
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:20,580
This is the best!

875
01:17:20,650 --> 01:17:21,880
No!!

876
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:23,860
Yumeko! Let's run away!

877
01:17:25,190 --> 01:17:28,300
You are a hostage.

878
01:17:28,350 --> 01:17:31,500
I won't let you run away.

879
01:17:33,390 --> 01:17:34,970
Suzui-san.

880
01:17:34,970 --> 01:17:37,480
Clear your mind and let's enjoy it.

881
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:40,500
I can't! This is a gambling game where we might die!

882
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:42,610
That's exactly why.

883
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:49,630
I have to do my best to fight this person to the death.

884
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,320
That's right.

885
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:59,620
Round one.

886
01:18:20,260 --> 01:18:21,060
Me?

887
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:23,960
We're starting from the player Jabami Yumeko.

888
01:18:24,610 --> 01:18:27,400
Yumeko! They're gonna shoot me!

889
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:31,890
If you're shot at but there's no bullet you're at least able to get some money.

890
01:18:31,890 --> 01:18:33,400
You can't win without making money.

891
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:35,180
What are you saying?

892
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:36,860
If there's a bullet then I'll die!

893
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:40,360
That's not only you but the others as well.

894
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:43,780
Here!

895
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:47,180
Alright!

896
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:53,360
I'll make some progress.

897
01:18:55,070 --> 01:18:56,400
How nice!

898
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:57,590
There are two bullets currently.

899
01:18:57,590 --> 01:19:00,660
Shikigami Makurou earns 100 million yen.

900
01:19:07,810 --> 01:19:09,870
President!

901
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:12,600
Do you want me to die that badly?

902
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:14,890
It's so we can win!

903
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,160
Hold on!

904
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:24,060
Where are you putting that card?

905
01:19:25,270 --> 01:19:26,930
In the shooting area.

906
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:29,220
You can't!

907
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:36,480
-Then...  -No! No! No! Not that one either!

908
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,740
Because then all 3 hostages will be shot!

909
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:40,240
He's saying it...

910
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:43,400
There's only 10 cards left! What if a Bang card appears?

911
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:47,110
This is an escape game where you avoid getting shot!

912
01:19:47,110 --> 01:19:48,400
You don't understand.

913
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:55,660
This is a game where you use bullet cards to make money and aim the gun at the opponent.

914
01:19:55,830 --> 01:19:57,540
What you said is wrong!

915
01:19:57,540 --> 01:20:02,670
Will you be shot? Will you die? Will you earn money? That's the game!

916
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,980
There's no helping it.

917
01:20:08,690 --> 01:20:10,500
There we go.

918
01:20:11,870 --> 01:20:15,640
Nice one Yumeko!

919
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:22,960
Are you satisfied with this Jabami Yumeko?

920
01:20:24,610 --> 01:20:27,510
Again!? Stop it!

921
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:32,930
Please don't get a Bang card!

922
01:20:34,420 --> 01:20:35,320
Bang.

923
01:20:35,380 --> 01:20:37,000
Bang!

924
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:40,570
The bang card.

925
01:20:40,820 --> 01:20:42,520
Bang!

926
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:45,040
Please calm down Suzui-san!

927
01:20:45,150 --> 01:20:48,140
The last card is my turn.

928
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:56,700
I got a good card.

929
01:21:00,370 --> 01:21:01,640
Bang!

930
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:10,970
You're very murderous aren't you?

931
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:12,960
That's what kind of game it is right?

932
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,720
That's right!

933
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:20,090
The card has been confirmed and Russian Roulette will start.

934
01:21:21,610 --> 01:21:25,240
There will be 2 bullets in this Russian Roulette.

935
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:29,120
Jabami Yumeko will shoot at Shikigami Makurou.

936
01:21:55,220 --> 01:21:56,750
Really?

937
01:21:56,930 --> 01:21:58,720
Will she shoot?

938
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:03,810
The probability of Shikigami dying is 1/3.

939
01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:07,860
Go!

940
01:22:23,740 --> 01:22:25,560
Come!

941
01:22:26,060 --> 01:22:29,170
Jabami Yumeko.

942
01:22:31,970 --> 01:22:35,390
You're quite bold huh?

943
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:56,310
You missed!

944
01:22:56,720 --> 01:23:00,380
Shikigami Makurou has recieved 700 million as a survival bonus.

945
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:02,080
The first round is over.

946
01:23:02,450 --> 01:23:04,660
Going 5 rounds is impossible!

947
01:23:04,660 --> 01:23:08,480
Someone will die before it ends!

948
01:23:09,890 --> 01:23:14,060
Who is going to die?

949
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:17,790
You guys!

950
01:23:20,570 --> 01:23:25,740
I'm going to make you guys die by cheating!

951
01:23:27,290 --> 01:23:31,140
First, I gave this guy a code.

952
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:35,310
He will give out a Bang card when I want him to.

953
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:40,640
However, that is not all.

954
01:23:40,890 --> 01:23:43,260
There are two kinds of bullets.

955
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:45,260
The first one is a real bullet.

956
01:23:45,340 --> 01:23:50,840
And the other one is this dummy bullet.

957
01:23:51,090 --> 01:23:55,190
This kind of bullet won't shoot out even if you pull the trigger.

958
01:23:57,320 --> 01:24:01,940
The real bullet is in here.

959
01:24:03,530 --> 01:24:15,060
I had a dummy bullet in there when I was getting shot at and will put a real bullet in there to kill you.

960
01:24:15,770 --> 01:24:20,040
Listen up Jabami Yumeko and Momobami Kirari!

961
01:24:22,180 --> 01:24:28,290
I only gamble when I'm sure of winning!

962
01:24:30,270 --> 01:24:37,620
I will paint the both of you in the color of despair!

963
01:24:41,060 --> 01:24:43,640
Round 2.

964
01:24:53,900 --> 01:24:56,570
The starting player is Shikigami Makurou.

965
01:24:56,570 --> 01:24:58,430
I'm going to kill you.

966
01:25:00,540 --> 01:25:01,700
Two bullets!?

967
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:05,280
3 bullets are present now and Shikigami Makurou has earned 200 million yen.

968
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:07,060
The probability is 1/2...

969
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:09,240
Come to me!

970
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:11,240
Is this fine?

971
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:14,610
That's not it...

972
01:25:17,940 --> 01:25:19,400
A bang.

973
01:25:20,230 --> 01:25:21,600
Bang!

974
01:25:25,940 --> 01:25:28,350
This depends on Shikigami!

975
01:25:28,350 --> 01:25:31,940
There's no mistaking it...He...

976
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:33,900
You.

977
01:25:41,780 --> 01:25:45,000
The card is decided. Russian Roulette will start.

978
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,290
There are 3 bullets.

979
01:25:46,290 --> 01:25:49,660
Shikigami Makurou will shoot.

980
01:25:55,370 --> 01:25:56,740
I'll kill you!

981
01:25:56,740 --> 01:25:58,740
-President!  -Sayaka.

982
01:25:58,740 --> 01:26:00,740
Shut your mouth.

983
01:26:11,110 --> 01:26:14,540
It's a real bullet.

984
01:26:17,300 --> 01:26:20,170
It's the promised time.

985
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:25,220
I'll have you return my 2 years.

986
01:26:26,610 --> 01:26:30,800
Be scared Momobami Kirari!

987
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:40,580
Shikigami...

988
01:26:48,660 --> 01:26:50,990
You were lonely huh?

989
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:56,210
Die!

990
01:26:58,140 --> 01:26:59,880
Shit!

991
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:12,860
Momobami Kirari has recieved 800 million yen as a survival bonus.

992
01:27:14,380 --> 01:27:16,850
Round 3.

993
01:27:26,820 --> 01:27:30,070
It starts with Momobami Kirari.

994
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:37,690
This is good right? Right?

995
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:41,290
I want to make money.

996
01:27:43,450 --> 01:27:45,020
Nice!

997
01:27:45,020 --> 01:27:46,300
There are 3 bullets currently.

998
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:48,810
Jabami Yumeko gets 200 million yen.

999
01:27:48,810 --> 01:27:50,290
How's this?

1000
01:27:51,590 --> 01:27:53,570
No!

1001
01:27:58,530 --> 01:28:00,080
No!

1002
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:01,800
That was sexy.

1003
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:03,700
Yumeko please! Turn it back!

1004
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:05,400
True...

1005
01:28:05,490 --> 01:28:11,010
If the shot is adjusted to 1/2 of the probability...

1006
01:28:12,930 --> 01:28:14,610
It's a Bang.

1007
01:28:22,190 --> 01:28:24,140
The final turn is Shikigami.

1008
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:25,620
No! No! No!

1009
01:28:25,620 --> 01:28:27,490
Jabami Yumeko will...

1010
01:28:27,740 --> 01:28:30,860
There it is! My card!

1011
01:28:30,860 --> 01:28:32,600
She said it...

1012
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:33,640
Shikigami!

1013
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:34,730
Play it!

1014
01:28:34,730 --> 01:28:36,560
I want to be shot by the president!

1015
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:39,700
Or I can shoot Jabami Yumeko...

1016
01:28:40,510 --> 01:28:42,160
But I want to be shot!

1017
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:44,160
Play it!

1018
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:46,640
I understand.

1019
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:53,140
Let's kill each other!

1020
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:04,320
What are you doing you bastard?

1021
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:06,550
Play the other one!

1022
01:29:08,590 --> 01:29:11,120
I want to see this...

1023
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:16,100
The card is decided. Russian Roulette will start.

1024
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:17,550
There are 3 bullets.

1025
01:29:17,660 --> 01:29:21,600
Suzui Ryota will shoot Jabami Yumeko.

1026
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:28,180
I will shoot Yumeko?

1027
01:29:28,380 --> 01:29:35,850
It's going to be a real one of course.

1028
01:29:53,350 --> 01:29:55,070
Yumeko...

1029
01:30:01,540 --> 01:30:03,280
No...

1030
01:30:04,350 --> 01:30:06,640
I can't!

1031
01:30:14,900 --> 01:30:18,100
It's okay Suzui-san.

1032
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:22,770
This gun will not shoot bullets.

1033
01:30:22,770 --> 01:30:24,770
For real?

1034
01:30:29,820 --> 01:30:33,040
Hurry up and shoot so I can earn money.

1035
01:30:35,220 --> 01:30:37,100
You're lying...

1036
01:30:38,190 --> 01:30:39,620
I know Yumeko...

1037
01:30:39,620 --> 01:30:42,000
You might die you know?

1038
01:30:43,490 --> 01:30:46,350
This guy can't shoot.

1039
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:49,760
Just surrender.

1040
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:53,650
That's right...

1041
01:30:54,020 --> 01:30:56,250
I can't shoot...there's now way I can shoot!

1042
01:30:56,250 --> 01:30:59,660
-Yumeko, let's surrender...   -Shoot it!

1043
01:31:00,570 --> 01:31:02,900
Will you keep running away?

1044
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:07,220
What's going to happen if you run away and leave this school?

1045
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:11,790
People like us will disappear like dust.

1046
01:31:12,250 --> 01:31:16,820
In that case being killed by that gun will be the same thing.

1047
01:31:17,790 --> 01:31:24,100
I...will not give up this opportunity to fight side by side with you!

1048
01:31:28,610 --> 01:31:30,450
Suzui-san.

1049
01:31:30,990 --> 01:31:33,120
Please shoot.

1050
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:39,260
There will be no bullet...

1051
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:44,210
I...

1052
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:13,360
I'll believe you Yumeko.

1053
01:32:15,910 --> 01:32:19,010
If I believe you and you're wrong...

1054
01:32:20,250 --> 01:32:25,840
I'll shoot myself too...

1055
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,340
Shit...

1056
01:32:34,790 --> 01:32:36,520
Shit!

1057
01:32:41,950 --> 01:32:44,680
Yumeko said it.

1058
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,990
There's no bullets!!

1059
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,360
He missed...

1060
01:32:56,610 --> 01:32:58,380
He shot...

1061
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:10,460
He didn't shoot her...

1062
01:33:15,220 --> 01:33:17,100
Bang!

1063
01:33:20,430 --> 01:33:23,880
Jabami Yumeko earns 800 million yen as a survival bonus.

1064
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:27,300
The amount received at the end of the third round is...

1065
01:33:27,300 --> 01:33:29,480
Shikigami Makurou with 1 billion yen...

1066
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:31,480
And Jabami Yumeko with 1 billion yen.

1067
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:34,540
Momobami Kirari with 800 million.

1068
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:38,230
Who do you support?

1069
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:40,600
The person who wins!

1070
01:33:52,690 --> 01:33:54,940
Good work.

1071
01:34:14,220 --> 01:34:16,870
Thank you!

1072
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:32,630
Round 4.

1073
01:34:32,630 --> 01:34:35,340
It starts with Jabami Yumeko.

1074
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:42,300
Again?

1075
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:46,020
You're not scared anymore are you?

1076
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:49,700
There are currently 3 bullets.

1077
01:34:49,700 --> 01:34:52,880
Jabami Yumeko gets 200 million yen.

1078
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:57,740
I'll increase it.

1079
01:35:02,850 --> 01:35:04,440
4!!

1080
01:35:04,580 --> 01:35:07,230
Now someone really is gonna die!

1081
01:35:07,230 --> 01:35:08,500
There are 4 bullets.

1082
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:11,370
Shikigami Makurou earns 100 million yen.

1083
01:35:13,130 --> 01:35:16,250
Someone's going to die huh?

1084
01:35:16,250 --> 01:35:17,710
You can shoot now right?

1085
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:22,380
In that case...

1086
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:31,390
How about this?

1087
01:35:33,580 --> 01:35:38,120
If Bang comes out then this will be the best.

1088
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:43,860
Bang.

1089
01:35:48,830 --> 01:35:50,990
Now then!

1090
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:54,300
There's one card left.

1091
01:35:54,650 --> 01:35:59,960
President, don't worry about my situation.

1092
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:09,340
Jabami Yumeko.

1093
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:14,340
Yes?

1094
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:18,480
You'll show me a good time right?

1095
01:36:21,230 --> 01:36:23,900
Of course.

1096
01:36:31,890 --> 01:36:34,010
No way!

1097
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:36,650
Why?

1098
01:36:36,650 --> 01:36:39,620
-Herself... -She will...

1099
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:44,960
What are you doing Jabami Yumeko?

1100
01:36:45,120 --> 01:36:46,180
Way to go.

1101
01:36:46,550 --> 01:36:48,320
President!

1102
01:36:48,970 --> 01:36:53,760
This is the best! You are the best!

1103
01:36:54,380 --> 01:36:56,650
I didn't even think this...

1104
01:36:58,060 --> 01:37:02,210
The card is decided. Russian Roulette will start.

1105
01:37:08,630 --> 01:37:12,140
There are 4 bullets in this Russian Roulette.

1106
01:37:12,140 --> 01:37:15,830
Momobami Kirari will shoot Momobami Kirari.

1107
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:29,410
I told you 2 years ago right?

1108
01:37:30,410 --> 01:37:38,770
You'll be destroyed by this gun.

1109
01:37:53,380 --> 01:37:57,060
There are 4 bullets out of 6...

1110
01:37:59,660 --> 01:38:03,840
Will you shake so bad you can't pull the trigger?

1111
01:38:05,740 --> 01:38:13,600
Why do you think you were expelled from this academy?

1112
01:38:16,460 --> 01:38:21,640
Because I ruined half of the students.

1113
01:38:26,020 --> 01:38:27,890
That's not it.

1114
01:38:37,990 --> 01:38:47,700
You're...boring.

1115
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:02,580
Two shots...

1116
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:07,310
Shikigami...

1117
01:39:10,730 --> 01:39:13,720
I will kill you.

1118
01:39:24,830 --> 01:39:27,960
She makes me so excited...

1119
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:30,880
The final round.

1120
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:32,920
The current score is...

1121
01:39:32,920 --> 01:39:35,140
Momobami Kirari with 1.7 billion yen.

1122
01:39:35,140 --> 01:39:37,220
And Jabami Yumeko with 1.2 billion.

1123
01:39:37,220 --> 01:39:40,080
And Shikigami Makuro with 1.1 billon yen.

1124
01:39:42,180 --> 01:39:46,180
If you want to win then you have to be shot.

1125
01:39:46,180 --> 01:39:47,860
Yumeko!

1126
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:50,860
It came!

1127
01:39:50,860 --> 01:39:52,860
Don't be happy!

1128
01:39:57,830 --> 01:39:58,710
No!

1129
01:39:58,710 --> 01:40:01,170
That's my line stupid!

1130
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:05,270
I will shoot myself?

1131
01:40:05,270 --> 01:40:07,030
Yumeko! Change it back! Change it!

1132
01:40:07,030 --> 01:40:08,140
Okay!

1133
01:40:08,330 --> 01:40:09,780
There we go!

1134
01:40:09,910 --> 01:40:13,320
An extra bullet...

1135
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:14,520
There are two bullets.

1136
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:17,200
Jabami Yumeko gets 100 million yen.

1137
01:40:20,990 --> 01:40:25,320
Everyone is going to shoot me?

1138
01:40:30,230 --> 01:40:31,520
There are 3 bullets.

1139
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:33,740
Momobami Kirari gets 100 million yen.

1140
01:40:33,740 --> 01:40:36,770
There is a 3/6 probability that 3 people will shoot?

1141
01:40:36,770 --> 01:40:37,950
Die!

1142
01:40:37,950 --> 01:40:38,820
Die.

1143
01:40:38,820 --> 01:40:39,580
Die!

1144
01:40:39,580 --> 01:40:40,260
Die.

1145
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:42,260
Bye bye!

1146
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:55,080
Bang!

1147
01:40:57,680 --> 01:40:59,310
Bang!

1148
01:40:59,310 --> 01:41:02,070
Shikigami is the last one.

1149
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:09,710
I really wanted to kill you guys.

1150
01:41:11,300 --> 01:41:13,030
It's too bad.

1151
01:41:16,470 --> 01:41:19,820
The card is decided. The Russian Roulette will start.

1152
01:41:19,820 --> 01:41:24,850
There are 3 bullets. Three players will fire at Shikigami Makuro.

1153
01:41:24,850 --> 01:41:26,850
Hey! That's unfair!

1154
01:41:26,850 --> 01:41:27,700
Why?

1155
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:29,700
Himself...

1156
01:41:30,500 --> 01:41:33,040
We're saved!

1157
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:36,370
It's your loss.

1158
01:41:38,840 --> 01:41:41,680
I will use the dummy ones.

1159
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:44,160
And they will shoot me 3 times.

1160
01:41:44,160 --> 01:41:46,160
The bullets won't come out.

1161
01:41:46,550 --> 01:41:49,480
Then I will get 2.4 billion yen.

1162
01:41:49,480 --> 01:41:52,900
And have a total of 3.5 billion yen.

1163
01:41:53,090 --> 01:41:55,490
I won.

1164
01:41:56,500 --> 01:42:01,510
You guys...will disappear.

1165
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:29,750
Are you happy with this?

1166
01:42:30,610 --> 01:42:32,530
Yeah.

1167
01:43:13,700 --> 01:43:15,840
Now then.

1168
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:19,040
You're the last one.

1169
01:43:39,350 --> 01:43:42,310
Are you prepared?

1170
01:43:42,660 --> 01:43:44,820
Shikigami Makuro.

1171
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:49,360
You wanted to kill me right?

1172
01:43:49,820 --> 01:43:54,530
However if the bullets don't come out...

1173
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:58,720
I win!

1174
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:04,460
You are quite bold.

1175
01:44:06,580 --> 01:44:09,390
You're not scared.

1176
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:15,750
The remaining 4 bullet nests contain 3 bullets.

1177
01:44:17,470 --> 01:44:18,390
Shoot.

1178
01:44:18,390 --> 01:44:20,390
Please hold on.

1179
01:44:20,390 --> 01:44:25,280
I have something to tell you before you die.

1180
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:31,080
When I was defeated by you...

1181
01:44:31,980 --> 01:44:37,090
I was actually very frustrated.

1182
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:43,660
That's the first time I tasted that flavor.

1183
01:44:45,550 --> 01:44:52,080
I started to feel so humiliated.

1184
01:44:52,410 --> 01:44:54,690
What are you trying to say?

1185
01:44:54,690 --> 01:45:00,160
I wanted to win.

1186
01:45:04,100 --> 01:45:07,320
I wanted to defeat you.

1187
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:09,660
Shoot.

1188
01:45:09,660 --> 01:45:13,470
You're not afraid of the bullets...

1189
01:45:13,470 --> 01:45:15,380
It's over...shoot!

1190
01:45:15,380 --> 01:45:17,840
You put a special bullet in.

1191
01:45:19,140 --> 01:45:24,760
And one real bullet.

1192
01:45:25,540 --> 01:45:30,310
A real bullet? It's impossible for you to put a real bullet in.

1193
01:45:30,440 --> 01:45:33,840
I'm the only one who has the real bullet.

1194
01:45:33,860 --> 01:45:35,670
Now then!

1195
01:45:35,670 --> 01:45:37,670
Shoot!

1196
01:45:40,990 --> 01:45:45,700
It's the real bullet in the hands of the president.

1197
01:45:45,700 --> 01:45:47,700
Farewell.

1198
01:45:48,330 --> 01:45:50,080
Shikigami.

1199
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:52,260
Farewell.

1200
01:45:53,140 --> 01:45:54,700
Shikigami.

1201
01:46:07,530 --> 01:46:09,380
Hold on!

1202
01:46:13,210 --> 01:46:16,390
What's wrong Shikigami?

1203
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:19,130
She has it...

1204
01:46:20,780 --> 01:46:22,180
She has a real one!

1205
01:46:22,180 --> 01:46:25,030
Why are you so nervous?

1206
01:46:25,030 --> 01:46:27,030
Wait, hold on!

1207
01:46:29,640 --> 01:46:32,410
Why do you know?

1208
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:45,260
There's no way that bullet is in there!

1209
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:49,060
They only acted on my orders!

1210
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:52,300
Shoot!

1211
01:46:52,300 --> 01:46:54,300
Hold on!

1212
01:46:55,480 --> 01:46:57,600
When and where?

1213
01:46:58,580 --> 01:47:00,340
It's impossible!

1214
01:47:00,690 --> 01:47:06,950
Shoot me with that bullet!

1215
01:47:20,440 --> 01:47:22,980
Bye bye.

1216
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:26,560
An invitation card.

1217
01:47:26,780 --> 01:47:29,680
It's an invitation from the president.

1218
01:47:29,680 --> 01:47:33,100
I'll write a letter to Mary-san!

1219
01:47:39,160 --> 01:47:42,410
The card is decided. The Russian Roulette will start.

1220
01:47:42,410 --> 01:47:48,100
There are 3 bullets. All 3 players will shoot Shikigami.

1221
01:47:57,130 --> 01:47:59,530
Don't shoot!

1222
01:48:06,100 --> 01:48:10,580
There is a bullet...

1223
01:48:10,650 --> 01:48:14,820
I was lying. It's a bluff.

1224
01:48:15,260 --> 01:48:16,710
That gun...

1225
01:48:16,710 --> 01:48:21,260
This kind of pathetic trick can't fool you.

1226
01:48:21,460 --> 01:48:25,100
I mean, you have carefully designed this.

1227
01:48:25,100 --> 01:48:28,920
And created a win-win game.

1228
01:48:28,920 --> 01:48:30,920
It's perfect.

1229
01:48:31,540 --> 01:48:32,860
Please shoot.

1230
01:48:34,070 --> 01:48:35,800
Hold on!

1231
01:48:36,020 --> 01:48:37,680
Oh my...

1232
01:48:38,020 --> 01:48:41,560
What's wrong Shikigami-san?

1233
01:48:41,980 --> 01:48:44,590
Are you scared?

1234
01:48:46,810 --> 01:48:49,320
It's okay.

1235
01:48:49,680 --> 01:48:55,010
When you die, I will die with you.

1236
01:48:55,120 --> 01:48:56,390
What are you doing Yumeko?

1237
01:48:56,390 --> 01:48:59,870
Because I already lost to the president!

1238
01:48:59,870 --> 01:49:03,860
Before I leave the school, I want to bet my life with the president!

1239
01:49:03,860 --> 01:49:06,420
Now then, shoot the final bullet!

1240
01:49:06,420 --> 01:49:08,280
Will it shoot a bullet or not?

1241
01:49:08,280 --> 01:49:12,800
I've become so desperate because your design was so perfect!

1242
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:17,640
Now then! Let me see your color!

1243
01:49:17,640 --> 01:49:19,360
-Let me go!  -Shoot!

1244
01:49:19,360 --> 01:49:23,940
Aim straight at Shikigami's heart and shoot!

1245
01:49:23,940 --> 01:49:26,920
Now! Now! Now!

1246
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:30,190
Let's fall into the abyss of gambling together!

1247
01:49:34,660 --> 01:49:36,220
Bang.

1248
01:50:03,450 --> 01:50:06,660
That's why you're boring.

1249
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:19,240
Shikigami disappeared.

1250
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:24,520
Yumeko lost the bet but nothing happened to her.

1251
01:50:25,210 --> 01:50:27,300
Suzui-san!

1252
01:50:27,540 --> 01:50:29,350
Yumeko!

1253
01:50:35,940 --> 01:50:37,880
It came again!

1254
01:50:38,140 --> 01:50:39,010
Again?

1255
01:50:39,010 --> 01:50:39,760
Yes!

1256
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:41,760
Is that...

1257
01:50:45,440 --> 01:50:49,300
A notification that the sports meeting is canceled!

1258
01:50:49,350 --> 01:50:51,020
Saotome! Saotome!

1259
01:50:53,710 --> 01:50:55,010
Hey, where is Saotome?

1260
01:50:55,010 --> 01:50:56,550
Saotome!

1261
01:50:56,790 --> 01:51:00,150
Go and look for her!

1262
01:51:05,700 --> 01:51:07,940
Saotome! Are you in debt again?

1263
01:51:07,940 --> 01:51:12,030
It's weird! Wasn't the housepet curse caused by Shikigami?

1264
01:51:12,030 --> 01:51:15,640
Why am I always unlucky?

1265
01:51:23,570 --> 01:51:25,160
Oh my!

1266
01:51:25,770 --> 01:51:36,810
Whatever you do you will fail.

1267
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:42,620
You will fail, you will fail...

1268
01:51:42,900 --> 01:51:44,940
Saotome!

1269
01:51:45,780 --> 01:51:47,730
Oh Devil!

1270
01:51:47,730 --> 01:51:51,800
I give you my soul and body!

1271
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:56,610
Take away all the good fortune of Saotome Mary!

1272
01:51:56,610 --> 01:51:59,730
And give her the housepet curse!

1273
01:52:11,080 --> 01:52:15,070
Is this a human body?

1274
01:52:21,500 --> 01:52:28,740
I'm a gambler in the Devil world. Satan of the Casino.

1275
01:52:33,350 --> 01:52:37,480
Let's sing the pioneering song together!

1276
01:52:37,560 --> 01:52:39,250
Get ready to sing!

1277
01:52:49,300 --> 01:52:51,340
Yumemi!

1278
01:52:51,480 --> 01:52:53,200
Yumemi!

1279
01:52:53,200 --> 01:52:56,810
Pioneer!

1280
01:52:57,900 --> 01:53:04,020
Since then the power of the student council has been stronger than ever.

1281
01:53:04,080 --> 01:53:06,940
Why is that?

1282
01:53:08,230 --> 01:53:10,740
It's the way it should be.

1283
01:53:11,940 --> 01:53:16,740
