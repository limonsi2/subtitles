the unsung hero
of the silver screen.

00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,439
For years, these men
and women were a secret.

Paid good money to
make the stars look heroic.

71
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,799
But as cinema got
more sophisticated,

72
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,639
it became harder to
pretend that a mere actor

73
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,680
could pull off such feats.

was paid to jump off a cliff

for the silent film, the
count of monte cristo.

78
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,639
And so, an occupation was born.

00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,839

does a person need

he used to train for a very,

177
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,599
And I talked to him
as a little shy kid

178
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,399
and he'd tell me about
the movies he'd done,

179
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,039
from the dam busters,
to Rob Roy, Robin hood.

180
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,119
And really, that's
where I first got the ideas

181
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,319
of being a stuntman, not
knowing it was a stuntman,

182
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,679

and gallop up the gallops

and a very famous horse
stuntman called Jimmy lodge

186

would come and exercise
the horses with us.

187
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,479
Then he wanted to borrow a horse

for a movie called
arabesque in '65.

189
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,239
I let him have the
horse, and anyway,

190
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,679
he called me the next day
because it was a really good horse,

191
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,159
but a very strong
horse, and he said,

192
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,839
"look, the horse is great, but, you
know, I need somebody to ride it

193

"oh, I wouldn't do it that way."

684
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,239
You'd see a guy, you
know, hurt himself coming off

685
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,919
of a balcony or something
because he didn't fall right.

686
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:24,639
Yeah. And so we learnt, I
learned by other people's...

687
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,479
Watching other
people that did it well,

688
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,479
and-and some of their mistakes.

689
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,759
-Because I was an
apprentice at rolls Royce

690
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,359
and was into
helicopters and that,

691
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,399
and did my five years
engineering-wise,

692
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,959
it was nothing... you
could come out with ideas

693
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,079
that you used to get on
a... On a set and look at,

694
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,759
uh, a layout to what
they were doing and say,

695
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,799
"well, that ain't gonna
work. We need to do this."

696
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,959
So, I came in at that era,
and I got so much work

697
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,959
I couldn't but of course,

698
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,719
that didn't help the situation
between the old guys and myself,

699
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,319
because they said,
"how come this bastard

700
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,399
is getting all the
work and he's...

701
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,959
He's only been in the
industry five minutes?"

702
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,759
-And there was
a lot of... I mean,

703
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,959
you hear terrible stories

704
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,519
as that, that when
they were doing ivanhoe

705
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,759
in [indistinct]

706
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,800
[Man groans]

707
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,639
[Paul Weston] A
guy went up there to

708
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,799
do a fall off a battlement.

709
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,560
And he put his boxes down
and the mattresses and whatever.

710
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,519
And someone had put some
rocks in on the top of the bed.

711
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,399
If you, they didn't like
you, then you may,

712
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,159
you know, not,
you may get injured.

713
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,879
Um, so yes, so I think it
was tougher in those days

714
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,559
because they were,
they were wrestlers,

715
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,439
and they were
boxers and they were,

716
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,519
um, people from the east end,
from the west end, you know.

717
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,279
Um, they were all
trying to make a living.

718
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,279
They would drive, you
know, down to Spain

719
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,599
if there's a movie in Spain

720
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,919
and just be there and
they would, you know,

721
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,159
work on the film
and sleep in the car.

722
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,039
I mean, there was
no organization.

723
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,039
They just did it to,
because, you know,

724
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,519
they'd earn enough
money out of it

725
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,439
to-to bring some money home.

726
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,599
That was... [Clears throat]

727
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,239
The difficulty that was going
on in terms of paddy Ryan

728
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,759
and-and jock Easton.

729
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:16,039
Um, Joe Powell and Eddie
Powell, um, they were...

730
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,479
They were doing that because
there was no other way.

731
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,199
That-that's, you know,

732
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,439
that's the way the
business was at that time.

733
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,959
They had no respect other
than, you know, if you get up there,

734
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,639
and you fall off, that's great.

735
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,039
Get a round of applause.

736
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,399
Away you go. They didn't
want any other than that.

737
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,639
And we used to, um,
have to sign blood chits,

738
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:39,959
which meant that
you forego any, um

739
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,679
you-you take on all the
responsibility of that fall.

740
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,519
If you fell on somebody
and killed them,

741
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,039
you would be sued.

742
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,439
We got our first sort
of, um, guild together,

743
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,999
and we said, "look, we got
to not be extras anymore.

744
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,079
We need to be part of equity
and start to-to get some respect

745
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,439
from the industry, uh,
as stunt performers."

746
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,519
-I think people finally realized

747
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,319
that being a stuntman

748
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,479
did not necessarily
the basic criteria was

749
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,839
being an ex-boxer

750
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,319
with a sort of broken nose and
a cauliflower ear, and he says,

751
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,839
"I'll have a go at that, governor."
There was a lot more to it,

752
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,559
and we were getting
more mechanized,

753
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,799
and people would, you
know, the car, I mean,

754
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,839
bullets had come out,

755
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,079
and the great car chase
had suddenly become,

756
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,000
"mm. Let's have
a little go at that."

757
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,000
[Cars speeding]

758
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,280
[Car tires screeching]

759
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,920
So, you can't do that
kind of stuff with that.

760
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,560
[Ray Winstone] It was
time for things to change.

761
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,639
-We'd done two or
three bonds in england,

762
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,399
and there's people who are
interested in coming over here

763
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,719
and doing more action pictures.

764
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:01,399
And, you know, they want to,
to, uh, uh, nail down the skills,

765
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,479
which is why those
stunt coordinators

766
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,999
got together with equity.

767
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,079
And the stunt register
was thus formed.

768
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,679
If you had two stunt contracts,

769
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,559
you could come
on the stunt register,

770
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,559
and you were
accepted as a stuntman.

771
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,639
-A lot of the stunt guys
that were established

772
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,559
thought it was, you
know, just a gimmick,

773
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,079
and they didn't want
to pay to go in it.

774
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:24,079
And they-they thought
it was a silly idea

775
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,839
because they were
already established

776
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,519
in their own little way.

777
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,039
But once we got into equity,
the other guys had to come in.

778
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,639
Either they joined us in
equity, or they weren't,

779
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,959
you know, they weren't insured.

780
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,999
And we started the first
insurance through, um, lloyds.

781
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,919
-And we began
getting proper contracts

782
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,759
which were stunt contracts.

783
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,839
They weren't just a
glorified artist's contract;

784
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,519
they were stunt contracts.

785
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,159
And that was that again
made a big difference

786
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,279
because we'd said we set
our own minimum daily rates

787
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,279
and said, "we will not
perform for less than that.

788
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,399
If you want to go
outside the register

789
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,479
and get somebody who
wants to do it for thruppence,

790
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,759
then that's your business.

791
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,119
But what you will get

792
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,359
when you come to
somebody on the stunt register

793
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,879
is a professional
performer or coordinator,

794
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,519
who's done it before and
expects to be paid correctly

795
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,599
and expects to have a
contract which is enforceable

796
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:23,239
if either of you step outside
the realm of that contract."

797
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,719
And that's the way
it should be done.

798
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,279
-We came in with
no qualifications.

799
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,159
We were all hypocrites
in the world, you know.

800
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,639
[Laughs] Let's face it.

801
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,919
We dec-decided for the
better of the film business,

802
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,839
if you could form a group, an
organization of some people

803
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,999
that do have qualifications,
or if they haven't,

804
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,479
they work under people
that do have qualifications

805
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,159
and the safety
standards then are higher

806
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:48,079
because then we have
probationary, intermediate,

807
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,159
and then full members,
so they had to go through

808
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,199
a probationary period
to an intermediate period.

809
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,599
And when they're intermediate,

810
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,239
they could coordinate
their own stunts,

811
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,359
but they couldn't
coordinate for other people.

812
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,639
And then, once they got
enough qualification for that,

813
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,239
then they became
stunt coordinators

814
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,519
which is a totally
logical and sensible

815
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,839
and safe way of doing it.

816
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,399
-So, when they come
in, they're vetted,

817
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,039
so you had a committee who vet
whether they could ride a horse,

818
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,679
whether they could
do a fight scene,

819
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,119
whether they could
handle a sword,

820
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,799
whether they could do a fall,
they could swim. They could dive,

821
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,199
whether they could drive a car,

822
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,759
whether they could
drive a motorbike.

823
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,359
And then we formed a
book called the stunt register.

824
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,039
-Known as the book of lies.

825
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,080
[Upbeat music]

826
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,359
'Cause if one put
a dot by everything,

827
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,879
you know, they
could do everything

828
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,159
and say, "there's a black dot."

829
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,159
So that was commonly
known as the book of lies.

830
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,199
-My ex-partner, Alan Stewart,

831
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,839
did a car jump in
Hong Kong, right?

832
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,999
We had a car transported
there with a bus parked here,

833
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,039
and he goes over, jumps the bus.

834
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,879
And he put [laughs]

835
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,159
One year, he put that picture

836
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,959
of this happening in
the stunt book, right,

837
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,999
and Eddie eddon, god
rest his soul as well,

838
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,799
he put the same picture in in
his column of the same jump.

839
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,839
I'll never forget it.

840
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,599
I've still got the...
That one particular one.

841
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,359
-And it progressed
from there, really,

842
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,279
and it became something of...

843
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,639
Then became something
of a closed shop,

844
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:12,359
so that we, the stuntmen,
had a kind of monopoly

845
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,919
on doing stunts,
and the producers

846
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,039
only wanted to use
people off the stunt register

847
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,199
unless there was a particular
skill of something, like a...

848
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,359
You know, a trapeze artist
or something you could do,

849
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,079
then fine, but otherwise,

850
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:27,119
they were encouraged very
much to go on to the stunt register.

851
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:33,759

great. That was great.

Okay, next shot's over here."

1022
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,119
And I said, "excuse
me, Mr. Spielberg"

1023
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,239
and he went, "hm?"

1024
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,999
And this was the first
time he was even aware

1025
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,159
I was on the set, coordinating.

1026
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,999
Um, I said, "I think
that was a miss."

1027
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,399
"No, I think it was a hit."

1028
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,759
And I said, "i'm-I'm
pretty sure it was a miss."

1029
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:07,159
You know, we have to stand
up and be counted, you know,

1030
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:09,239
so anyway. Okay, we do it again,

1031
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,599
and he's a bit sarcastic,
and we did it again.

1032
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,199
So you cut to
nearly five days later,

1033
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,759
because in those days, they'd
send the rushes back to england,

1034
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,319
they'd process and have a look at
them and they'd send them back,

1035
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,799
and then they set up a
projector in the lobby of the hotel.

1036
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,279
And sure enough,
the shot comes up,

1037
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:25,239
and I'm about three
rows back from Spielberg.

1038
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,959
And he watches it and
you see the first one,

1039
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,039
and he went, "you're
absolutely right, Vic."

1040
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,439
By now we're friends, you know.

1041
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,599
"You're absolutely right,
Vic. Yeah, it was a miss."

1042
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,239
And the next one
comes, it's on the money.

Cool. I couldn't do
anything wrong after that.

1044
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,359
So that was... I-I'd
earned my spurs.

on Indiana Jones and
the temple of doom.

1054
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,799
I've fought with him on that
hanging stair at the bridge

where, when the bridge is
broken and men are hanging on it.

-Up the top one is
Vic and I, obviously.

But on the 30-foot

I've always got on
well with Harrison.

1059
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,559
I've worked on about
four or five films with him.

I've been out to

A lovely man.

1062
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,959
And Harrison said,

"I don't want to fight
with him" - the actor.

1064
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,679
He said he may not know
where to miss and all that.

1065
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,959
So I let frank up there.

1066

He falls, goes past me, and
then grabs a rung below me

bashed off me and flew past.

snapped because he went so fast

down the other side.

[♪♪♪]

1187
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,319
And I jumped it onto the skip,

1188
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,879
and then Wayne
gets out of the car

1189
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,879
and bang, and so forth.

00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,639
[♪♪♪]

1191
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,559
When they put those
three pieces together,

1192
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:18,599
when you see the film,

1193
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:21,119
it looks like you've
jumped the bridge.

1194
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,359
But, you know, you can't...

1195
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:23,759
There's no point
in telling lies,

1196
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,679
"I jumped tower
bridge," because I didn't.

1197
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:29,239
But, um, it's how it was
all, and also you couldn't,

1198
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:30,359
because in Wayne's book,

1199
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,119
he said, "frank, next
time we'll jump it."

1200
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,999
So, you-you couldn't
lie if you wanted to lie.

1201
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,719
And the last time I ever met
him I found out it was the same.

1202
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:40,399
I had bright green trousers on.

1203
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,599
All things had changed.

1204
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,719
No one wore evening
dress and all that.

1205
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:46,239
He went, "fucking hell, is
this in Saint Patrick's night?"

1206
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,399
[Laughs]

1207
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,719
So that was my... but I had
lots of conversations with him

1208
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:55,079
in between, and, um, some,
once again, you could tell,

1209
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,519
and some you can't,
you know. But...

1210
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,079
And so I met my
hero, as it were.

00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:01,159
[Ray Winstone] While
some of [indistinct] guys

-What did you do that for?

1219
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,559
-To remind you to
write letters occasionally.

1220
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,559
[Men laugh]
- I was sitting there.

1221
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:29,119
I was sitting on, sitting
in the desert with her,

1222
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,199
and they were shooting
this beautiful film

1223
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,319
of her and this baby,

1224
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:36,959
whose mother and father
have been shot or something.

1225
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:40,479
And she was there,
comfort-comforting this baby.

1226

Telling him how
wonderful, and don't worry,

1227
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,879
she'll look after
him and all that.

1228
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,559
And tears were
running down her eyes

1229
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:48,239
and tears were
running down my eyes.

1230
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,759
And I thought she was marvelous.

1231
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,479
So when she got
up and walked away,

1232
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:54,679
I said, "Irene, I cried.
You were fabulous."

1233
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:57,799
She went, "what?" I said, "you
made me cry with that scene."

1234
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,959
"Oh, thank you. Your
name, is it rocky?"

1235
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:02,559
She went, "oh, rocky,
thank you." "All right."

1237
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,759
A week later, we were on
a square with our horses

1238
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,319
and all the stuff on,
and guns and all that,

1239
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:14,479
and she's over
there, sitting in a chair

1240
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,479
and I'm on my horse
and she's going like that,

1241
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:18,800
and I've gone like that.

1242
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:26,879
And ten minutes later, I
get a tap on my shoulder.

1243
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,919
Yes, it's her assistant
with a little note,

1244
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:33,439
"yes. Would you care to have
dinner with me this evening?"

1245
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:38,080

and had dinner.

You were always busy.

Nobody thought about it.
They just gave you a contract.

1252
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,559
And these huge checks
would arrive through the thing

1253

and they-they'd
dent the doormat.

checks, you know.

I had no confidence.

-You're friends
but you're-you're...

It's an individual
business and, uh,

work, you don't eat,

so it is... it's cutthroat.

for the same jobs

down to your ability

to talk somebody
into employing you

up in the morning

else in the business

in the whole history
of British stunt work,

01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,079
there's really only one
name that sums up the guts,

ingenuity, outlandishness,

1287
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:18,839
the sheer swagger of
our homegrown term.

1288
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,119

was no postproduction.

So everything was
done in camera. And

we prepped and we prepped,
and we prepped to move,

on those early ones

1315
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,839
that we used to work on. And

1316
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:23,239
Bob would just say,
"oh, yeah, that's right.

that'll work. Yeah.

how to do things a little bit
more seriously, and all that,

coming up and supervising.

And-and, uh, if there
was a bit of sword work,

Bob Anderson would
be there teaching us,

01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:41,559
you know, a little bit of that.

1325
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:43,599

there. And they were great.

I mean, they
were just fantastic.

to get it right.

But woe betide,
if you got on there,

1330
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:55,479
and then you didn't get
it right because you...

1331
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,879
They'd paid for a few
weeks of rehearsal time,

1332

sure you're actually ready

So I-I was on fire. I
couldn't see anything.

1518
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:31,759
But I'd rehearsed with the boys

1519
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,199
I would fall down onto my knees,

1520
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:36,600
get up, move forward,
feel the side of the truck.

1521
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:43,839
Then on the floor,

1522
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:46,680
I had rocks so I could
feel it with my feet.

1523
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:51,960
And I could get in
position and then fall over.

1524
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,039
I was out of air.

1525
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,440
When I hit the
floor, I was out of air.

1526
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:10,159
And then they were putting
the flame bars up behind me,

1527
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:12,280
and it was like the
whole place blew up.

1528
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,639
Lucky enough they
came in very quickly,

1529
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:17,999
and took the mask off and I was

1530
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,359
but when I stood up and they're
shaking my hand and saying,

1531
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:21,679
"oh great, shot, wonderful."

1532
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:23,559
That's when I was burning.

1533
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:26,319

through the costume.

1534
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,679
The first costume had gone,

1535
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:32,479

burned all the way up the back,

1536
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:34,919
but the heat transference
going through the costume

1537
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:36,439

I think the boat
chase and all that stuff.

1544

15-20 mill, whatever it was,

1545
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:59,759
millions of dollars and pounds,

1546
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,319
doing that boat chase, and
it was all the other chases,

1547
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:04,279
and coming up with
ideas and directing it

1548
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:06,359

editing it with the editors

hairy ones you do. But

you've given yourself
to the industry.

1554

of you a lot of times.

The stuntmen, or
so-called stuntmen who say,

"I'm fearless, I
will do anything,"

You don't say, "I'm fearless."

1579
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:28,279
You stand on the
edge, you look at it,

1580
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:30,159
you check everything
out before you do it.

1581
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:32,959
-Fear. Fear is... is the edge

1582

that's... that's about
judgment and everything.

1583
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:39,719
And it's a question
of-of channeling that,

1584
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:41,799
to do that and not being
overwhelmed by the fear.

1585
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:43,999
Because the moment you
get overwhelmed by the fear,

1586
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,839
you're... you're...
You're knackered.

But you... you over...
You overcome that,

1590
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:54,839
or you learn to say no.

1591
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:57,119
But if you learn to say no
more than two or three times,

1592
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:58,799
when there's no
good reason for it,

1593
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,079
then you kind of go,

no, so I won't use him."

01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:42,479
So, I go up with Mark
boyle, up to the roof,

1683
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:44,279
and look 'round, look down.

1684
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:48,639
He said, "we'll put boxes
down there, put a car, dig a hole,

1685
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:50,999
put the boxes there.

1686
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,279
We'll hide the
camera behind the car.

1687
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:56,799
You'll be over there.

1688
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,079
Flames come up.

1689
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:01,359
You'll come to the
edge of the building.

1690
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:04,599
And the flames go up.

1691
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:07,919
As you jump, the
flames go up behind you.

1692
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:09,319
It engulfs."

1693
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:10,359
"I mean, yeah.

1694
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:11,559
Sounds fine to me."

1695
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:15,239
-Winner's on one
of his bad days,

1696
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:18,199
uh, and rocky's up there.

1697
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:20,919
Johnny Evans, special effects.

1698
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:25,919
Um, and John always
does what the director says.

1699
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:29,079
If he says, turn up...
Turn up the flames,"

1700
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:31,199
John would turn up the flames.

1701
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:33,359
-I'm standing there,
and I could hear,

1702
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:34,400
"turn over."

1703
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:38,000
I turn over. "Light
the building."

1704
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:40,520
They lit the building.

1705
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,959
And before I knew where I was,

1706
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:47,839
the building wasn't
just a little bit aflame.

1707
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:51,080
It was 17 feet, 20 feet high.

1708
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:56,919
The flames just come
up like a bomb; It blew up.

1709
01:18:56,920 --> 01:19:00,479
Winner flicked up the
switch. I'll never forget it.

1710
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,479
-And all I could hear
was winner going,

1711
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,719
"rocky, where are you? Rocky?

1712
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:07,119
Come on, rocky. Where's rocky?"

1713
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:08,879
I gotta... I gotta go.

1714
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:12,519
I know... I know that over
there where the boxes are.

1715
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:13,559
They're over there.

1716
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:16,079
If I can get through
them flames, and drop,

1717
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:17,919
I could land on the
boxes, and hopefully,

1718
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,759
everything will be alright.

1719
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:22,080
But it was very, very, very hot.

1720
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:28,159
So I put my hands to my face,

1721
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:29,400
I covered my face.

1722
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:35,040
And I ran to the wall.

1723
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:56,719
Coming down, I could
see it was a foot away

1724
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:58,560
the edge of the boxes.

1725
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:03,840
[♪♪♪]

1726
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:09,799
-If he hadn't of
pushed off as hard

1727
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:12,039
he'd have made the rig, totally.

1728
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:13,159
But because he...

1729
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:15,559
To get through the flame,
he pushed that bit harder,

1730
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:18,439
half of him went into the rig
and the other half stayed out.

1731
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:20,599
So he split himself in two.

1732
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:21,999
And it didn't need to happen,

1733
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:26,159
but it didn't need the
flames put up any more.

1734
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:27,759
[Rocky Taylor] I
broke my pelvis,

1735
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:30,239
my back, I have a burnt...

1736
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:33,280
My face is all blistered,
my hands are all blistered.

1737
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:42,279
So, I was in traction
for, uh, for three weeks

1738
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:46,319
where they had to
put a bolt through here,

1739
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:48,199
and a wire coming up here.

1740
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:52,039
And pull this bit every
day, with weights on,

1741
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:54,999
pulling it down,
to get it level.

1742
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:59,839
Mr. Winner then
came into the hospital,

1743
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:03,679
followed by five
or six newspapers.

1744
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:05,519
He laid next to me.

1745
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:07,479
And he whispered in my ear,

1746
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:09,839
"don't think you
can sue me, rocky,

1747
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:12,799
because you can't
get away with it."

1748
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,999
And he's got people
taking photographs of him

1749
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,239
lying next to me,
cuddling me, saying

1750
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:19,359
what a wonderful
man I was and all that.

1751
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:22,159
I'm now, you know,
40 years of age,

1752
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:26,639
just had a terrible accident
at the peak of my career.

1753
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:27,840
Gone.

1754
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,079
And it... it ruined, you know,

1755
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:34,960
that film ruined
my life completely.

1756
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:38,959
-I've done some heavy
stunts on the movies.

1757
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:40,199
I've... I've coordinated

1758
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:44,159
and there've been very
little accidents if any.

1759
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:49,639
The only one that we did have
was with Richard hammatt was,

1760
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:54,239
I had him doubling for
Superman on Superman III.

1761
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:56,839
And we had a Russian swing.

1762
01:21:56,840 --> 01:22:03,399
-I was playing, um, Clark Kent,
and it was an evil Superman.

1763
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:05,479
Christopher was
the evil Superman.

1764
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:06,520
[Kent] Aw, aw.

1765
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:09,239
[Superman] Come on, chicken!

1766
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:10,519
I'm gonna get you.

1767
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:13,079
Been on my nerves
for a long time.

1768
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:15,519
[Kent grunts]

1769
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:18,240
-He throws me
in the car crusher.

1770
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:21,039
-You always wanted to fly, Kent.

1771
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:22,679
Now's your chance.

1772
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:23,919
-O-On the Russian swing,

1773
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:28,039
you... you have somebody
behind you on this like a seesaw

1774
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:29,559
and you stand on one end.

1775
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:31,799
And when you get to your height,

1776
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:34,799
where... to the
trajectory you want,

1777
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:39,200
then you go off and you
get flown 35 feet, 40 feet.

1778
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:42,359
He just slightly mistimed it,

1779
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:45,199
and went straight up,
and came straight down.

1780
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:47,639
-I was turned to look down,

1781
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:50,199
I'm on... There's
a stack of cars,

1782
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:52,199
all these American
cars in a stack,

1783
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:53,959
and the airbag's
a bit further out

1784
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:56,639
because I'd gone
higher up. I went...

1785
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:59,199
"I'm not going to
reach the airbag."

1786
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:03,199
So I turned, and as I started
to go over onto my back,

1787
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:05,399
I thought, "I'm not going
to get right on the bag,

1788
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:07,639
I'm gonna lose kind
of catch my head,

1789
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:09,439
I'll be on the edge of the bag."

1790
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:12,079
So, I came down between
the bag and the cars

1791
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:13,599
and took it on this shoulder.

1792
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:15,999
It snapped all the
ribs off on this side.

1793
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,319
They went through the
lung, punctured the lung,

1794
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:22,759
and I had to get rid of the
blood in the... in the lung.

1795
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:25,279
So [laughs] my...
my face is like that.

1796
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:27,519
That's what the
doctor was doing.

1797
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:29,119
Anyway, I did.

1798
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:33,799
I got to discharge
myself out of hospital and

1799
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:35,360
I was back at work.

1800
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:41,119
-We were filming in Greece
for Pete brayham, sky riders,

1801
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:42,639
it was called sky riders.

1802
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:45,680
[Lively music]

1803
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:01,199
And what occurred is, they
were going to do one explosion

1804
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:05,559
what came out about 60
feet there and land there,

1805
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:07,199
and we were going
to run forward,

1806
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:09,519
and the second one would
come and explode over us.

1807
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:12,679
[Suspenseful music]

1808
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:15,720
[Bomb exploded]

1809
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:22,519
But this first explosion
went over our heads

1810
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:24,199
and it landed on the crew.

1811
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:26,519
I think 13 of them got burned.

1812
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:29,999
But the... I think he... He
was the boom operator,

1813
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,679
quite a big guy.

1814
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:32,959
He was the most burnt.

1815
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:37,479
So I ran after him and I got
him, and it was all alight here,

1816
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:39,959
and I've lived with this
ever [Indistinct] in my life,

1817
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:41,439
and we all had shorts on.

1818
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:42,559
And this is all alight.

1819
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,759
So I tried to tear it off.

1820
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:45,919
I started jumping on him

1821
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:48,519
and trying to get
him on the ground.

1822
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:50,159
And I've lived with
it the rest of my life.

1823
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:51,439
I didn't save him.

1824
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:55,559
Then I think the producer
got him on the ground.

1825
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:58,599
But he died five days later.

1826
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:00,439
And it's come back
to the same point.

1827
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:03,679
You live with your mistakes.

1828
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:06,599
And you arch yourself
to your mistakes

1829
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:09,959
and... and there... there it is.

1830
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:12,119
-I hate it. I don't like it.

1831
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:13,799
I have to be
responsible, it's my job.

1832
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:15,359
But I worry about them,

1833
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,359
you know, but
we've got a job to do.

1834
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:21,359
And I need them to, you know,
fall over as hard as possible

1835
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:23,919
to look like they've been
shot or blown up, you know,

1836
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:26,079
but it's not a... you know,
I have to sign off on that,

1837
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:27,959
and I really... I've been hurt.

1838
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:30,359
And I know at some stages,
they are going to get a knock

1839
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:31,879
or bruise or whatever.

1840
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:35,079
But to be responsible
for that, it's not very nice.

1841
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:37,599
Um, you know, I've had
one serious injury on a film,

1842
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:40,559
and I would really never
want to do that again.

1843
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:42,799
You know, it's... it's
not a nice feeling at all,

1844
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,559
because it lives
with you forever.

1845
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:46,879
And I had a really hard
time for months and months

1846
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:49,799
after that injury
that they sustained.

1847
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:53,159
But, you know, uh, that was...
That was the name of the game

1848
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:55,759
and that's what we all
signed up to do, you know.

1849
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:58,359
No one put a gun to
my head or his head,

1850
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:01,599
to do what he done, and
he... David willingly done it.

1851
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,599
Unfortunately, it didn't
work out that well,

1852
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:06,279
and poor David's
ended up in a wheelchair

1853
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:07,879
for the rest of his life.

1854
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:12,119
Um, and I sort of carry
that guilt that I was the one

1855
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:16,360
who said "action" on that...
On that particular rehearsal.

1856
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:19,959
[Ray Winstone] Greg
was the stunt coordinator

1857
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:22,159
on all the Harry Potter films.

1858
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:24,439
During rehearsal
on the final film,

1859
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:26,279
Daniel Radcliffe's stunt double,

1860
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:27,519
David Holmes,

1861
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:31,279
sustained an injury
with a devastating result.

1862
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:33,279
-He just did a
jerk-back, you know,

1863
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:35,559
which we've done
that... On Harry Potter,

1864
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:38,719
every day was there a
jerk-back, you know, wand

1865
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:40,959
you know, expelliarmus,

1866
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:43,119
a flick and a
swish, stuff like that.

1867
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:46,639
It was a jerk-back, you know,
that he just landed wrong on.

1868
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:49,559
It's just... it's just one of
those things that happens.

1869
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:52,679
You don't want
it to happen at all.

1870
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:54,479
Not even if you
had a worst enemy,

1871
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:55,999
you wouldn't want
that to happen.

1872
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,639
And especially to David who i...

1873
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:01,599
He'd come into it
as a kid like I did,

1874
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:04,639
doing it, and then I
brought him in on Potter,

1875
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:06,959
of course he doubled
for Daniel Radcliffe,

1876
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:09,280
and poor sod ended
up in a wheelchair.

1877
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:14,999
-Do you stop shooting,
or do you carry on?

1878
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,359
Everyone straight
away, you say no,

1879
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:20,159
we can't carry on or whatever.

1880
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:21,199
But you have to.

1881
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:23,959
There's no there's
nothing you can do for him.

1882
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:25,759
There's nothing,
you... you know,

1883
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:27,359
everything's being done for him.

1884
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:31,399
You may feel, you know,
that out of respect or whatever,

1885
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:33,999
you w... you wouldn't
want to carry on,

1886
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,879
but the producers
are right, you know.

1887
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:37,519
You've just got to
get back in there

1888
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:40,879
and do it and then
you just carry on. Um

1889
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:44,239
I'm sure... with fatalities
that happen around the world,

1890
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:48,879
I'm sure, you know, it must
affect the crew very badly.

1891
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:50,719
But what do you do?
Where do you... you know?

1892
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:52,719
Do you stop or do you...

1893
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:54,639
And how long do you
stop for, you know?

1894
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:58,039
It's... it's far better to
just carry on with your job

1895
01:27:58,040 --> 01:28:00,840
and knowing that they're
being taken care of.

1896
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:05,519
-The low parts have
been away from the family.

1897
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:07,159
The family pay for it.

1898
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:09,759
-I missed the kids because
I was traveling a lot.

1899
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:12,319
When in the early days, you
just went where the money was

1900
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:13,879
or where the work was.

1901
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:18,719
So yeah, you know, they... I
think they missed me as well,

1902
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:20,639
as much as I missed them.

1903
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:24,159
But in those days, you-you...
That's where the money was.

1904
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:27,239
That's where the work was, so.

1905
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:29,919
-I think they knew
that it's my job

1906
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:33,199
and I'm a professional and I
know what I'm doing, hopefully.

1907
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:36,439
So they had confidence
in me, i'm sure

1908
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:38,319
but it's like someone
driving a lorry,

1909
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:41,599
"dad, be careful
today," you know

1910
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:45,440
I'm sure they did worry. But, uh

1911
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:47,839
where are we now?

1912
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:49,760
[Laughs]

1913
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:53,319
-So, they're the
worst things of it,

1914
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:55,799
I think, not seeing your
kids and everything else.

1915
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:58,759
You see them, you know, the
best you can and everything else.

1916
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:02,280
And there's obviously...
That's the worst thing, yeah.

1917
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:08,079
-So I think the industry's
changed an awful lot,

1918
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:09,439
an awful lot.

1919
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:13,359
And a lot of the craft is gone,
because most of the stunts now

1920
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:14,599
are done on the green screen.

1921
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:16,479
You can do it and
get away with it.

1922
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:20,399
-Everything's different
now, uh, uh, you know, the

1923
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:21,719
you-you-you're working on sets

1924
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:24,359
while I'm not there
maybe, you know.

1925
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:26,559
You're riding horses that
you're sitting on a box.

1926
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:27,879
They can put the horse on after.

1927
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:30,239
It's... it's, you know,
it's as simple as that.

1928
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:33,319
You could be driving a car at a
hundred mile an hour in a chase,

1929
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:34,519
or the actor can.

1930
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:37,159
He's... he's not doing it,
but they put him in there,

1931
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:38,199
or put the car 'round...

1932
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:39,799
It's... it's amazing
what they do today.

1933
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:41,679
-You could do the
greatest stunt in the world,

1934
01:29:41,680 --> 01:29:43,839
and people think, "oh,
yeah, it was missing cg.

1935
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:44,999
That was, uh, you know."

1936
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,559
And yet they see
a cg thing and go,

1937
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:48,399
"oh, you were fantastic."
And then, "yeah."

1938
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:50,279
You put the costume on
and walked into the shot

1939
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:51,519
and the rest is all cg.

1940
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:53,799
You know, it's, uh,
i-it is depressing.

1941
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:56,679
But i... you know, everything
goes round in a circle,

1942
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:58,759
certainly in the film game.

1943
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:01,039
And you can't knock cg.

1944
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:05,319
I think you can just knock
the people that use it too much,

1945
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:06,599
overuse it and abuse it,

1946
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:09,319
but it is a wonderful thing
and it's the type of films

1947
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:10,639
people want to go and see.

1948
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:13,719
-I'm not knocking cgi, because
they do a very good job.

1949
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:14,919
I mean, you've got marvel,

1950
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:17,119
you've got DC
doing all this stuff.

1951
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:20,159
I mean, good stuff, great stuff.

1952
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:22,319
But I think the live action

1953
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:24,960
beats any of that stuff
hands down, personally.

1954
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:30,279
-Nowadays, you get
specialists in to do the jobs.

1955
01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:31,439
I... fast and furious,

1956
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:34,519
I worked on fast and
furious, which was great.

1957
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:36,759
I mean, any... Any
stuntman in the world

1958
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:38,919
want to work on
fast and furious.

1959
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:40,239
And when I got the opportunity

1960
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:42,879
through Greg to work
on it, I was over the moon.

1961
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:47,079
Unfortunately, I didn't
get into the position

1962
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:49,519
doing the fast-driving stuff,

1963
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:54,519
because he got specialists in,
which was a bit downer for me

1964
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:56,279
and a bit downer
for some of the boys

1965
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:57,839
because we could all drive.

1966
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:59,599
I can drive as well as them.

1967
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:03,559
But he wanted rally drivers

1968
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:05,199
and people that
do it for a living,

1969
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:08,959
which is understandable.

1970
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:12,320
But a bit of a kick up the
old balls for us, you know.

1971
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:16,599
-When I started, you...
you were characters.

1972
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:20,039
You were brought in from extras,

1973
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:23,239
and if you were able to do
something that was great.

1974
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:26,079
Then you do stair falls,
then you start doing stunts.

1975
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:31,079
Um, but we weren't necessarily
trained in anything particular.

1976
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:33,919
So, we learned to do
those sorts of things.

1977
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:37,639
And we, and... got away
with it all these years.

1978
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:40,719
I wouldn't have got in
today in what they do.

1979
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:44,479
Uh, um, none of the earlier
stunt guys would have done.

1980
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:47,199
They... they are just
tremendous athletes.

1981
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:52,159
They have really perfected
the art of-of stunting.

1982
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:54,759
-They're a lot different
now, you know.

1983
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:57,479
Lot of... Different
type of people.

1984
01:31:57,480 --> 01:31:59,639
The guys that are
coming in today,

1985
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:03,199
a lot smaller in stature
because there's the big guys

1986
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:06,799
struggle to get through the,
uh, all the gymnastic stuff

1987
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:07,839
they have to do

1988
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:10,639
because physically not...
It's hard work for them.

1989
01:32:10,640 --> 01:32:13,760
Uh younger

1990
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:17,359
I don't think some
of them necessarily

1991
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:19,719
think about the
stunt work so much.

1992
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:21,159
I think they like the money,

1993
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:23,319
which is nice,
which is important.

1994
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:25,119
But, you know, it's
a lot of us on the first

1995
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:27,559
we just... We all
like a pound note,

1996
01:32:27,560 --> 01:32:28,599
and... and we want that,

1997
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:31,919
but the job's always
been important to us.

1998
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:33,719
-I do think the characters
have disappeared

1999
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:35,799
that were the Ken buckles,

2000
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:38,879
Bob Simmons, George leeches

2001
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:40,519
absolute... paddy Ryans...

2002
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:44,039
Absolute incredible
natural stunt people.

2003
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:45,079
-It's not as nice now

2004
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:47,719
because there's so
much money involved now.

2005
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:51,599
You know what I mean?
People sit and they're...

2006
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:55,399
They're doing that at
lunchtime in the afternoon.

2007
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:57,519
Where years ago, you'd
be pulling tricks on the guys,

2008
01:32:57,520 --> 01:32:58,999
you'd be doing
the three-man lift,

2009
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,959
you'd be hitting them
over the head with spoons,

2010
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:03,239
throwing wardrobes over
each other, tripping them up.

2011
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:05,959
It don't happen so much
now, and it was a laugh then.

2012
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:08,399
[Indistinct] It's... We
still have a laugh now.

2013
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:10,679
But, you know, when you
go into the dressing room,

2014
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:13,999
everyone used to be
gambling or reading the paper,

2015
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,759
or doing some work there.

2016
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:18,439
They all sit there now,
they're tapping away.

2017
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:20,279
See how much money
they got in their accounts.

2018
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:22,319
[Laughs]

2019
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:24,559
[Interviewer] What
age are you now?

2020
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:27,439
-What a no-good bastard.

2021
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:28,999
Er, 82.

2022
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,359
-Seventy-seven.

2023
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:32,080
-I'm 72 now.

2024
01:33:33,320 --> 01:33:34,519
-Well, I miss, at my age,

2025
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:36,119
being able to do
what I could do.

2026
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:37,599
And when I'm over
with my children,

2027
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:38,879
or my great-grandchildren,

2028
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:41,559
they say, "oh, granddad,
show us what you do."

2029
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:43,879
Yeah, well, it hurts a little
bit now if I do it, you know.

2030
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:46,399
The bones... I don't
want to take that chance,

2031
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:48,639
wind up with a hip replacement.

2032
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:50,399
-I have a lot of...
A new pair of knees

2033
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:53,599
and a new shoulder, so
you don't get up, you know.

2034
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:54,639
You fall over.

2035
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:56,399
It takes you like ten
minutes to get up now.

2036
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:58,279
Years ago, I'd do
whatever you want,

2037
01:33:58,280 --> 01:34:00,759
but now that just
takes too long,

2038
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:02,879
and the bruises
last a lot longer.

2039
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:05,239
-And I don't miss
performing at all.

2040
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:06,839
It was a means to an end.

2041
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:11,959
And again, I had the brains
to get out while I was still fit,

2042
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:15,719
you know, and I could feel
the reactions weren't there

2043
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:17,639
on the last crusade.

2044
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:19,719
It was there on the last
crusade, that I thought,

2045
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:21,919
"nah, I've had too
many racehorses

2046
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:24,520
that you have given one
race too many," you know.

2047
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:26,919
Dave bickers is my guru.

2048
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:29,399
Dave bickers, he was one of
the smartest people I've ever met

2049
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:30,519
in the business.

2050
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:32,719
I got him into the business;
He was a motorcycle racer,

2051
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:35,239
and he became my
engineer and designer.

2052
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:36,639
And... and he was
one of those guys

2053
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:38,879
that had so much common sense.

2054
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:41,119
And he said to me
when we were rehearsing,

2055
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:45,439
he said, "Vic, I always want
to stop before the last one."

2056
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:48,519
[Mutters] "What do you
mean, stop before the last one?"

2057
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:50,079
Then the penny dropped.

2058
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:54,479
Because it's like, um,
it's like that, you know

2059
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:56,119
"watch this. I'll just
give you one more.

2060
01:34:56,120 --> 01:34:58,679
You watch this." And that's
always the one you hurt yourself on.

2061
01:34:58,680 --> 01:35:01,039
Of course it's the last one,
because you've broken your leg

2062
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:03,359
or had a crash or something's
gone wrong with it, you know.

2063
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:06,079
[Laughs] And it made
so much sense to me.

2064
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:07,999
And I've told everybody
around the world.

2065
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,039
You know, you rehearse
things, rehearse things.

2066
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:11,279
"Let's do one more," and,

2067
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:13,879
"yeah, get ready."
You know, you do it.

2068
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:16,279
And it's not quite right,
and so it's "get ready" again.

2069
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:18,039
And people are going,
"okay," we get ready,

2070
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:20,399
and I said, "okay, and that's
a wrap. We're not doing it."

2071
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:23,319
"What do you mean?" And I was,
quote, stopped before the last one.

2072
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:25,719
-You don't leave the industry.

2073
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:27,799
The industry leaves you.

2074
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:31,119
And that's what
happens with stuntmen.

2075
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:32,959
-The phone never rings anymore.

2076
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:34,559
I don't mind because as I say,

2077
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:37,479
I can make money somewhere else,

2078
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:40,319
or I'll have something
else to keep me busy,

2079
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:41,959
and so forth and so forth.

2080
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:43,759
So that doesn't ring anymore.

2081
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:46,119
-If the phone stops,
then you're retired.

2082
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:48,760
Well, at the moment, it's
only twinkling. It's twinkling.

2083
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:51,959
That's the problem
at the moment.

2084
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:53,439
The financials.

2085
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:55,679
Coming in this industry, you
know, you get good money,

2086
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:56,879
and then you're out of work.

2087
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:58,559
You get good money,
you're out of work,

2088
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:00,199
you get good money,
you're out of work.

2089
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:02,399
And that's how
it's been all my life.

2090
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:04,479
And people always
used to say to me,

2091
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:06,719
"put some money away
for a rainy day, rock."

2092
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:09,159
"Yeah. What rainy day?"

2093
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:11,719
It never happened,
that rainy day,

2094
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:14,319
and it's started
pouring down now.

2095
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:16,159
You understand?
And it's too late.

2096
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:18,919
When it's too late,
what do you do?

2097
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:21,919
-It's time to live a life now.

2098
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:24,399
All that running around
all over the world,

2099
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:26,959
getting paid, was nice,

2100
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:29,199
I've got to say.

2101
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:31,719
But it's a young man's
game now, I think.

2102
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:33,279
-Why wouldn't you keep going?

2103
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:35,719
I mean, it's just... it's fun.

2104
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:37,919
You're getting paid for
playing cowboys and Indians,

2105
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:40,559
and you're getting paid well,
and as long as, you know,

2106
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:43,239
and-and... if i'm in a
zimmer frame one day,

2107
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:45,720
and they say, "we want you to
do a zimmer frame fall," I'll go,

2108
01:36:46,920 --> 01:36:48,839
"I'm your boy. I'll
have a go at it."

2109
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:52,119
-In the, um, force awakens,

2110
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:55,839
I doubled for, um,
Max-Max Von sydow,

2111
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:59,159
uh, in the opening sequence
when he gets cut in half.

2112
01:36:59,160 --> 01:37:02,039
[Suspenseful music]

2113
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:06,439
Uh, skyfall.
Spectre and skyfall.

2114
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:07,559
Um, and since then,

2115
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:12,759
I've done the mummy
with Tom Cruise in London.

2116
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:18,039
Star wars, um, rogue
one, I played a part of

2117
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:21,479
the... one of the
engineers getting shot.

2118
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:25,639
- Fire!
- [Rapid gunshots]

2119
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:27,839
-Transformers: The last knight.

2120
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:29,119
I'm in the next star wars,

2121
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:30,639
I'm just getting
blown up in that.

2122
01:37:30,640 --> 01:37:32,319
But as long as I can do it,

2123
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:34,039
and I'm comfortable
with it, I'll do it.

2124
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:38,039
I just... i don't... obviously
won't do anything

2125
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:41,999
that I think my old body
is not capable of doing,

2126
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:46,199
or it would make
me look silly doing,

2127
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:49,959
so a little bit dignity
in old age is good.

2128
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:51,719
-I mean, without,
being a stunt performer

2129
01:37:51,720 --> 01:37:53,119
going into the stunt industry

2130
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:55,559
which took me into
the film industry,

2131
01:37:55,560 --> 01:38:00,599
I would not be sitting here
now as a elderly gentleman,

2132
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:05,199
director, writer,
novelist, producer

2133
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:06,399
without the stunt business.

2134
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:08,839
The stunt business
took me into the industry

2135
01:38:08,840 --> 01:38:10,999
and gave me every
break I ever had.

2136
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,999
-I met some great
people like Wayne,

2137
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,279
Harrison Ford, Larry Olivier.

2138
01:38:16,280 --> 01:38:18,319
I enjoyed it. And
I'm pleased my son

2139
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:21,439
and that maybe my
grandson is gonna follow me.

2140
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:23,319
And I hope they have
the fun that I have.

2141
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:26,279
-I've got some personal
stresses that drive me mad, but

2142
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:28,239
I am happy.

2143
01:38:28,240 --> 01:38:30,479
-I wouldn't change any of it.

2144
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:32,319
Not one bit.

2145
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:34,399
-I wish I could do it again.

2146
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:36,359
I wouldn't change it.

2147
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:37,999
I'll save some of
me money, though.

2148
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,039
[Laughs]

2149
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:42,999
-I love the business,
and I hate the business,

2150
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,799
but I love it more
than I hate it.

2151
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:46,759
You know, a great friend
of mine, Terry Leonard,

2152
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:49,159
who used to double Harrison
with us on raiders as well,

2153
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:51,439
he did the stuff under
the bus, under the truck,

2154
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:53,959
which I can't claim
credit for, he did that.

2155
01:38:53,960 --> 01:38:55,519
But he always used to say to me,

2156
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:57,279
"Vic, at the end of
this game, business,

2157
01:38:57,280 --> 01:38:59,679
all you got is memories,
friends and eight by tens."

2158
01:38:59,680 --> 01:39:00,759
And he's so right.

2159
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:02,319
Eight by tens being
the photographs,

2160
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:03,759
memories and friends.

2161
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:05,759
-If I drop dead now
and they nail the lid on,

2162
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:07,159
all I've got left
is the memories

2163
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:09,999
and the memories have
been absolutely fantastic.

2164
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,799
Because all the,
everything around here,

2165
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:13,719
the motorbikes and the
house and everything,

2166
01:39:13,720 --> 01:39:16,679
we're just guardians of those
things, we don't own those.

2167
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:18,879
Those have nothing to
do with anything really.

2168
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:20,599
It's what you've seen,
what you've done,

2169
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:23,079
the people that you've met,
the people that you've enjoyed,

2170
01:39:23,080 --> 01:39:24,999
or helped or whatever,

2171
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,799
it-it-it-it's about the journey.

2172
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:31,439
Um, and when the flag, you
know, drops and, you know,

2173
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:33,239
they put you in the box,

2174
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:34,759
that's all that's left there.

2175
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:38,519
And so, I consider
myself extremely fortunate,

2176
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:40,119
extremely fortunate.

2177

And those occasions when I
have had near-death experiences,

2178
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:45,520
and there've been

2179
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:53,040

thought, "well, it is what it is."

And-and the things that we just,

2183
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:03,479
"yeah, we can do
that. Yeah. Okay."

2184
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:04,519
Unbelievable.

2186

of what I've done.

[Inhales deeply] Yeah.
It's always one more film.

2188
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:11,959
Just do one more
film and then I'll quit,

took Hollywood by storm.

recognized their faces before,

but maybe you'll
look out for them

next time you stick
on an old movie.

2195
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:32,799
And remember that for
every time someone fell,

2196
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:33,959
jumped, crashed,

2197
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:38,319
punched, kicked, stabbed,
swung or got blown up,

01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:39,799
