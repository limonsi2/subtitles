3
00:00:58,928 --> 00:01:00,625
<i>We've been</i> <i>
all around the world.</i>

4
00:01:00,669 --> 00:01:02,540
<i>Whole world tour.</i>

5
00:01:02,584 --> 00:01:05,108
<i>Australia, New Zealand,
Central Europe, Eastern Europe.</i>

6
00:01:05,152 --> 00:01:08,764
<i>All through America,</i> <i>
all of UK and Ireland.</i>

7
00:01:08,807 --> 00:01:11,810
<i>And now we're filming it in</i> <i>
the Top Secret Comedy Club.</i>

8
00:01:11,854 --> 00:01:15,205
Right by Covent Garden
where I was a street performer
for four years, so...

9
00:01:15,249 --> 00:01:17,164
it comes all the way around.

10
00:01:25,172 --> 00:01:28,392
I went down to Covent Garden.
It was nice, it was all ready
for Christmas.

11
00:01:28,436 --> 00:01:32,440
<i>That was my old life,</i> <i>
back between '85 and '89,</i>

12
00:01:32,483 --> 00:01:35,704
<i>and now we're here,</i> <i>
30 years later.</i>

13
00:01:35,747 --> 00:01:38,402
<i>I just wanted to see that</i> <i>
before I came</i> <i>
and did this show.</i>

14
00:01:38,446 --> 00:01:40,578
How does
that make you feel?

15
00:01:40,622 --> 00:01:44,626
Good, I like the circles.
Well, you know my whole theory,
the universe is about circles.

16
00:01:44,669 --> 00:01:48,369
And anything that circles round
tends to be good.

17
00:01:48,412 --> 00:01:51,720
The circle of life,
the circle of the universe,
the circle of the globe,

18
00:01:51,763 --> 00:01:53,417
the circle of orbits.

19
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:54,940
What goes around comes around.

20
00:01:54,984 --> 00:01:58,248
If you do good things, you can
get benefits back to you.

21
00:01:58,292 --> 00:02:00,511
We start off
as little small children

22
00:02:00,555 --> 00:02:02,687
and we don't have much
capability in our bodies

23
00:02:02,731 --> 00:02:06,604
and we end up shrinking down
to little old men and old women,

24
00:02:06,648 --> 00:02:09,607
who don't have much capability
and control of their bodies.

25
00:02:09,651 --> 00:02:12,741
And then it ends. Everything
seems to go around in circles.

26
00:02:29,801 --> 00:02:33,240
Ah, that's, uh,
that's just a lot of bottles

27
00:02:33,283 --> 00:02:35,242
going into a bottle bank,
I assume.

28
00:02:35,285 --> 00:02:37,026
Because we're here in this,

29
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:39,768
as you can hear from the whir,
you can hear this
in the background.

30
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:44,468
This is a car park. That is
the fan for an underground
car park here at Central London.

31
00:02:44,512 --> 00:02:46,949
And everything's
just jammed together.

32
00:02:46,992 --> 00:02:49,560
So, back in the clubs,
like in the early days.

33
00:02:49,604 --> 00:02:53,303
I'll keep eating nuts because
apparently they're good for you.

34
00:02:53,347 --> 00:02:55,523
This one, I don't like so much.

35
00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:57,916
Do I like this one?
I like this one.

36
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,484
Now I'm gonna put this away
and I'm gonna get ready.

37
00:03:00,528 --> 00:03:04,184
Goodbye to everyone,
for the moment. Cheers.

38
00:03:08,275 --> 00:03:09,363
Now stop filming.

39
00:03:09,406 --> 00:03:10,755
Okay, you can cut there.

40
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:17,458
<i>And the bigger gigs</i> <i>
at the London Palladium</i> <i>
on this tour,</i>

41
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:20,025
<i>you throw out the lines</i> <i>
and the laughs come back,</i>

42
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:21,766
<i>then you throw out</i> <i>
the next line.</i>

43
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,768
<i>That's more like</i> <i>
an ocean liner.</i>

44
00:03:25,335 --> 00:03:27,772
<i>A speedboat adapts</i> <i>
and moves quickly.</i>

45
00:03:27,816 --> 00:03:31,820
<i>That's what this one was like,</i> <i>
they react faster.</i>

46
00:03:31,863 --> 00:03:35,824
<i>Very much like playing</i> <i>
in the Comedy Store, playing</i> <i>
in the early clubs in London.</i>

47
00:03:36,955 --> 00:03:39,349
<i>Keeps you on your toes.</i>

48
00:03:39,393 --> 00:03:42,787
<i>This audience isn't necessarily</i> <i>
fans of mine.</i>

49
00:03:42,831 --> 00:03:46,313
<i>They are people</i> <i>
from the mailing list of</i> <i>
the Top Secret Comedy Club.</i>

50
00:03:46,356 --> 00:03:50,317
<i>They're not going to go</i> <i>
with everything.</i> <i>
You've got to win them over.</i>

51
00:04:15,342 --> 00:04:18,606
<i>Please welcome</i> <i>
Eddie Izzard.</i>

52
00:04:31,358 --> 00:04:32,707
Good evening!

53
00:04:34,143 --> 00:04:35,536
Hello.

54
00:04:37,407 --> 00:04:41,977
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to my Wunderbar show.

55
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,718
Yes, thank you.

56
00:04:45,676 --> 00:04:47,461
Tonight, I'm gonna
talk about everything.

57
00:04:47,504 --> 00:04:49,854
I'll talk about
from the Big Bang
up to last Thursday,

58
00:04:49,898 --> 00:04:51,987
all that stuff.

59
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,859
Since the Big Bang,
there have been
five great mass extinctions.

60
00:04:54,903 --> 00:04:56,905
Not one, not two, but five.

61
00:04:56,948 --> 00:04:58,602
Uh, which means
the creatures came

62
00:04:58,646 --> 00:05:00,691
and they had lots of eyes...

63
00:05:00,735 --> 00:05:04,826
Then they blew up or disappeared
or went on holiday
and never came back,

64
00:05:04,869 --> 00:05:06,393
and then a second lot
turned up.

65
00:05:06,436 --> 00:05:07,655
Then they all disappeared.

66
00:05:07,698 --> 00:05:09,396
The fifth lot
were the dinosaurs.

67
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,661
You know about them,
165 million years
we had of those guys.

68
00:05:13,704 --> 00:05:16,403
Remember, we've had about
500 years of good stuff.

69
00:05:16,446 --> 00:05:18,970
165 million years of...

70
00:05:20,624 --> 00:05:22,496
That's all they did.

71
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:24,889
Morning, noon and night.

72
00:05:24,933 --> 00:05:26,369
They were pirates.

73
00:05:27,457 --> 00:05:28,676
We're pretty sure now.

74
00:05:28,719 --> 00:05:30,417
We don't know if they
ever said "Jim Lad."

75
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,637
But we know they went...

76
00:05:33,681 --> 00:05:36,553
Then, as you may well know,
a big rock came
from outer space again,

77
00:05:36,597 --> 00:05:40,514
pretty random to me, and...
hit down in the Gulf of Mexico.

78
00:05:40,557 --> 00:05:42,603
All this stuff went up
into the atmosphere

79
00:05:42,646 --> 00:05:45,083
and killed the weather systems
and the dinosaurs died

80
00:05:45,127 --> 00:05:48,913
in the K-T extinction
within two years,

81
00:05:48,957 --> 00:05:53,440
and some say these days it could
be... There's a new theory,
it could be within two hours.

82
00:05:53,483 --> 00:05:56,747
With tsunamis of water and fire
and all the dinosaurs were gone.

83
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:59,141
Only 25 percent of creatures
made it through.

84
00:05:59,184 --> 00:06:05,103
And one was a little shrew-like
meerkat-ish creature.

85
00:06:05,147 --> 00:06:09,760
Little mammal, underground,
and his name was Kenny.
We think.

86
00:06:09,804 --> 00:06:12,720
We're not sure of that,
we're making a guess there.

87
00:06:12,763 --> 00:06:15,026
And we are related to him.

88
00:06:16,245 --> 00:06:18,203
That's not a plan, is it?

89
00:06:18,247 --> 00:06:21,598
That's... You wouldn't...
You wouldn't...

90
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,605
You wouldn't vote for this God
in a referendum.

91
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:31,608
It's too much like a crack plan,
isn't it?

92
00:06:31,652 --> 00:06:34,655
Think about it.
If all the dinosaurs
did go in two hours...

93
00:06:34,698 --> 00:06:37,092
We know they went,
but if it was in that two hours,

94
00:06:37,135 --> 00:06:39,834
it would've gone overnight
and all these
underground creatures,

95
00:06:39,877 --> 00:06:44,229
next morning,
they would've got up and gone...

96
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,452
Boom. Boom.

97
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,727
I'm gonna go upstairs.

98
00:07:16,087 --> 00:07:17,524
Where the fuck is it?

99
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,137
"Hi." "Yeah?"

100
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,226
"There's no fucking thing
up here."

101
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:25,270
"What?"

102
00:07:25,314 --> 00:07:26,881
"There's no fucking thing here."

103
00:07:26,924 --> 00:07:28,578
"Oh, I can't hear."

104
00:07:32,582 --> 00:07:34,149
"Where the fuck is it?"
"I don't know."

105
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,499
"That's what I mean."

106
00:07:37,674 --> 00:07:40,503
That could be true.

107
00:07:40,547 --> 00:07:43,680
That may be why meerkats
are often seen going...

108
00:07:46,553 --> 00:07:47,945
Because they remember that day.

109
00:07:48,946 --> 00:07:50,774
Oh, yes.

110
00:07:50,818 --> 00:07:52,994
So, this little creature
made it through.

111
00:07:53,037 --> 00:07:55,823
It was a shrew-like creature
that ate insects.

112
00:07:55,866 --> 00:07:57,564
So, we ate a lot of insects.

113
00:07:57,607 --> 00:08:00,175
Then at a certain point
went...
This is disgusting.

114
00:08:00,218 --> 00:08:04,614
Then we stopped eating insects
and asked for steaks and things
and breakfast cereal.

115
00:08:04,658 --> 00:08:07,965
And later on,
we became the great apes.

116
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:10,054
Of course, we all
were part of the great apes.

117
00:08:10,098 --> 00:08:12,056
With the gorillas
and chimpanzees.

118
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,146
Then the gorillas separated
from us and the bonobos
and those guys,

119
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:18,062
about ten million years ago,
and they went
and stood over there.

120
00:08:18,106 --> 00:08:20,238
I don't know why,
but they just separated.

121
00:08:20,282 --> 00:08:22,937
Six million years ago,
the chimpanzees
separated from us.

122
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,766
They took all the bananas
with them.

123
00:08:31,293 --> 00:08:33,904
Fucking hell.

124
00:08:33,948 --> 00:08:36,559
First banana jokes were
six million years ago,
we know that.

125
00:08:37,168 --> 00:08:38,909
They found...

126
00:08:38,953 --> 00:08:43,348
They found the remains
of a chimpanzee in that position

127
00:08:43,392 --> 00:08:45,612
where he'd obviously fallen
on a banana skin.

128
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:47,614
We're pretty sure.

129
00:08:47,657 --> 00:08:49,311
Then we started to talk
100,000 years ago.

130
00:08:49,354 --> 00:08:51,269
100,000 years ago,
we started to talk.

131
00:08:51,313 --> 00:08:54,838
The FOXP2 gene
is very central to this.

132
00:08:54,882 --> 00:08:56,623
So, 100,000 years ago, talking.

133
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:59,321
There's the cognitive revolution
which is about 70,000 years ago,

134
00:08:59,364 --> 00:09:02,237
which is imagination,
those two things are us.

135
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,195
Talking plus imagination
equals humans.

136
00:09:04,239 --> 00:09:05,893
Apart from that, we're just...

137
00:09:05,936 --> 00:09:07,851
we're the same as
the rest of the animals.

138
00:09:07,895 --> 00:09:10,637
But the talking, very important.
We got it 100,000 years ago.

139
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,683
This FOXP2 gene, we don't know
how we got it,
but we know we got it

140
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:16,643
100,000 years ago, probably
on a Tuesday, about half-three.

141
00:09:16,686 --> 00:09:18,079
We think something like that.

142
00:09:18,122 --> 00:09:21,169
And we were just monkey people.
Just gatherers,

143
00:09:21,212 --> 00:09:23,563
just going around...

144
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:33,355
"Wow.

145
00:09:36,271 --> 00:09:37,664
"Oh, this one's very tasty.

146
00:09:41,363 --> 00:09:43,670
"I'm talking, Gerald.
I'm talking, can you hear me?

147
00:09:43,713 --> 00:09:45,323
"I always thought you're Gerald.

148
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:47,108
"Are you Gerald? You can't talk.

149
00:09:47,151 --> 00:09:48,675
"You can't talk.
Try one of these.

150
00:09:48,718 --> 00:09:50,981
"Open your mouth. Shut up.
Just open your mouth."

151
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:53,680
"Why did you do that?

152
00:09:53,723 --> 00:09:56,683
"Oh, my God. I'm talking too.

153
00:09:56,726 --> 00:09:59,076
"I said, Oh, my God,
is there a God?
I don't think so.

154
00:10:01,165 --> 00:10:02,732
"Gerald, this is amazing."

155
00:10:02,776 --> 00:10:05,082
"I can't be Gerald,
you're Gerald.
I'm Gerald? Two Geralds.

156
00:10:05,126 --> 00:10:06,693
"That's not going to work."

157
00:10:06,736 --> 00:10:08,172
"Well, who the fuck
are you then?"

158
00:10:08,216 --> 00:10:09,434
"I am Samantha..."

159
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:11,698
"Are you gender-fluid?"

160
00:10:11,741 --> 00:10:13,134
"I'm gender-fucking-liquid,
baby."

161
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:17,138
"Are we talking German?"

162
00:10:17,181 --> 00:10:19,227
"Could be German, could be
Spanish, could be French.

163
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,576
"Could be English.

164
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,273
"No, I think it's probably
English or Spanish.

165
00:10:22,317 --> 00:10:24,145
"Seems quite easy, this.

166
00:10:24,188 --> 00:10:27,061
"The Germans would have
more rules in their language."

167
00:10:27,104 --> 00:10:31,761
"Yes, they would, masculine,
feminine, neuter,
'things made out of wood.'

168
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:33,197
"I agree."

169
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:35,069
And then there came a point
where they...

170
00:10:35,112 --> 00:10:37,898
we left Africa,
the "out of Africa" theory.

171
00:10:37,941 --> 00:10:39,726
"Come, we must get out
of Africa.

172
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:42,032
"You other monkeys,
you non-talky monkey people,

173
00:10:42,076 --> 00:10:44,948
"you stay here and guard
the village, we're going

174
00:10:44,992 --> 00:10:46,733
"out of Africa.
Going to make a film.

175
00:10:46,776 --> 00:10:48,256
"It will be on DVD eventually.

176
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:52,216
"So, you stay...
Can you understand?

177
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,218
"Do you... Just..."

178
00:10:54,262 --> 00:10:55,785
"Don't want to stay."

179
00:10:56,873 --> 00:10:58,745
"You speak English?"

180
00:11:02,183 --> 00:11:03,837
"Do you speak German?" <i>"Si."</i>

181
00:11:05,795 --> 00:11:07,275
"Do you speak Spanish?" <i>"Ja."</i>

182
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:09,973
"How did you learn
four languages?"

183
00:11:10,017 --> 00:11:12,236
"We bought tapes, okay?"

184
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,891
"Where did you buy tapes?"
"We bought them online."

185
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:17,459
"Online?"
"Yeah, the line over there,
we're just hanging on.

186
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:19,461
"My uncle sells them.

187
00:11:19,504 --> 00:11:21,376
"Two bananas each."

188
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:24,161
"Well, I'll be
a monkey's uncle."

189
00:11:24,205 --> 00:11:26,294
"No, that's him.
He's the monkey's uncle."

190
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:31,386
So, yes, so, 100,000 years ago
we started talking

191
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:34,955
and from that day,
100,000 years ago to here,

192
00:11:34,998 --> 00:11:37,305
today in London, nothing
really has happened.

193
00:11:38,349 --> 00:11:40,264
No, it's been kinda
"same old, same old."

194
00:11:40,308 --> 00:11:42,789
We did start to think
70,000 years ago, apparently.

195
00:11:42,832 --> 00:11:45,356
Which is interesting,
the cognitive revolution.

196
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,404
But, uh, I think we invented God
on the way,
I think we invented God.

197
00:11:49,447 --> 00:11:53,756
Makes sense, to...
to answer things
that we didn't understand.

198
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,978
'Cause if there was a God,
I think everything should pray,
not everyone but everything.

199
00:11:58,021 --> 00:11:59,283
Al the animals should pray.

200
00:11:59,327 --> 00:12:01,329
You've never seen
an animal praying.

201
00:12:01,372 --> 00:12:04,985
Never seen tigers praying,
"We're going in for a hunt,
going to get a buffalo.

202
00:12:05,028 --> 00:12:07,770
"We're going to have breakfast.
Padre, quick prayer. Thank you.

203
00:12:09,424 --> 00:12:12,166
"Eyes down for a full house.

204
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:15,517
"Oh, great God, Timmy the tiger
who lives...

205
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:20,783
"who lives up in the clouds,
until that day
when we learn to fly

206
00:12:20,827 --> 00:12:23,220
"through the clouds and then
we notice he isn't there,

207
00:12:23,264 --> 00:12:25,962
"and we'll just
never mention it again.

208
00:12:26,006 --> 00:12:28,356
"God, Timmy, please bless
this, our hunt.

209
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,488
"Make our feet fleet of foot.

210
00:12:30,532 --> 00:12:32,055
"Whatever that means.

211
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:35,102
"Make our teeth
even more pointed
than they usually are.

212
00:12:35,145 --> 00:12:38,453
"And when we find a young
and tender buffalo,
please let us

213
00:12:38,496 --> 00:12:44,415
"tear him apart in an orgy
of blood and violence
in your mercy.

214
00:12:45,895 --> 00:12:50,117
"Aah... tigers."

215
00:12:51,466 --> 00:12:54,512
That should happen,
but it doesn't.

216
00:12:58,603 --> 00:13:02,042
Now, we started this show
in Paris next to
Notre Dame cathedral.

217
00:13:02,085 --> 00:13:04,522
A beautiful cathedral.
I do like the buildings.

218
00:13:04,566 --> 00:13:07,569
You know, Notre Dame is
a testament to human creativity,

219
00:13:07,612 --> 00:13:10,398
built for a God who didn't
make it to the opening night.

220
00:13:10,441 --> 00:13:12,356
When they opened
the Notre Dame cathedral,

221
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,359
he didn't make it to
the 500th year anniversary
of the building.

222
00:13:15,403 --> 00:13:17,884
Didn't make it
when it was on fire,

223
00:13:17,927 --> 00:13:19,929
which you'd think he could've
turned up then.

224
00:13:19,973 --> 00:13:23,933
Just go, "Sorry, I'll get some
rain clouds. Come on, lads,
rain clouds. Here we go."

225
00:13:23,977 --> 00:13:25,456
But they are
beautiful buildings.

226
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,937
Cathedrals, churches, especially
with candles.

227
00:13:27,981 --> 00:13:29,373
I love them with candles.

228
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:31,506
I always get a candle for Mom,
a candle for Dad.

229
00:13:31,549 --> 00:13:35,379
I like that part
of the Catholic faith.
The rest of it, I'm gonna leave.

230
00:13:35,423 --> 00:13:37,120
Just the candle bits.

231
00:13:37,164 --> 00:13:40,907
It makes churches look
fantastic, especially
in an action movie.

232
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,909
They look excellent, don't they?

233
00:13:42,952 --> 00:13:46,086
Jason Bourne.

234
00:13:48,218 --> 00:13:52,005
<i>♪ Ahh</i>

235
00:13:52,048 --> 00:13:54,921
There's this wonderful,
contemplative moment

236
00:13:54,964 --> 00:13:56,836
where you look at it
and it's great.

237
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:00,448
And some cathedrals are mixing
it up, Liverpool Cathedral
has a cafe in it.

238
00:14:00,491 --> 00:14:04,408
I think that's excellent.
Good laugh. Um, just saying.

239
00:14:04,452 --> 00:14:06,367
Have you just joined us?

240
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:12,634
Okay, you'll have to stuff
a sock in that.

241
00:14:12,677 --> 00:14:15,463
Uh... otherwise it's gonna be
ruling the show.

242
00:14:17,073 --> 00:14:19,336
But yes, Liverpool Cathedral
has a cafe in there

243
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,948
and I think that's good,
Jesus would have liked that.

244
00:14:21,991 --> 00:14:25,473
He said, "My table
is not a place...
house of money,

245
00:14:25,516 --> 00:14:29,129
"but coffee, yes,
because I've got a Sermon
on the Mount coming up

246
00:14:29,172 --> 00:14:31,958
"and I gotta stay awake
and learn all these lines."

247
00:14:32,001 --> 00:14:33,611
So, Notre Dame cathedral
is beautiful,

248
00:14:33,655 --> 00:14:36,571
it's got flying buttresses, <i>
arc boutons,</i>

249
00:14:36,614 --> 00:14:39,052
if you want to drop that
into conversation, ever.

250
00:14:39,095 --> 00:14:41,054
Um, and it's called Notre Dame,

251
00:14:41,097 --> 00:14:43,143
it's named after
an American football team.

252
00:14:43,186 --> 00:14:46,711
Which is...
which is kinda crazy.

253
00:14:46,755 --> 00:14:51,586
Some people say. Others say,
"Notre Dame, 'our lady.'
It's the mother of Jesus."

254
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:54,458
Apparently, she built it
or caused it to be built.

255
00:14:54,502 --> 00:14:59,942
She came over from Judaea,
it's a whole Dan Brown, <i>
Da Vinci Code,</i> kind of story.

256
00:14:59,986 --> 00:15:05,992
Came over way back in 1973,
before any of us were born.

257
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:08,124
Going...

258
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:11,519
"But who are you?"

259
00:15:11,562 --> 00:15:12,912
"I'm Mrs. Jesus, I am.

260
00:15:14,652 --> 00:15:16,480
"My son told me to build this."

261
00:15:16,524 --> 00:15:18,352
"But he died 2,000 years ago."

262
00:15:18,395 --> 00:15:19,701
"Yeah, traffic was hell.

263
00:15:21,572 --> 00:15:25,228
"They're digging up
the Mediterranean
to put in irrigation."

264
00:15:25,272 --> 00:15:29,276
"Mrs. Jesus, tell us the story."
"Well, well, my son,
he was on his death bed."

265
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:31,539
"Mom, I'm on my death bed, Mom.

266
00:15:31,582 --> 00:15:33,367
"I'm dying. The Romans,
they got me, Mom."

267
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:36,109
"What happened?" "I'll tell you
what happened.

268
00:15:36,152 --> 00:15:37,371
"I was in the Garden
of Gethsemane

269
00:15:37,414 --> 00:15:39,503
"with Judas and James
and Matthew and Kenny.

270
00:15:39,547 --> 00:15:41,331
"Stevie Nicks, Roger McGough.

271
00:15:42,506 --> 00:15:44,682
"Che Guevara.

272
00:15:44,726 --> 00:15:48,425
"Uh, Konrad Adenauer,
Kenny Dalglish and the Pope,

273
00:15:48,469 --> 00:15:50,601
"and we're all playing
Shove Ha'penny and <i>Scrabble.</i>

274
00:15:51,863 --> 00:15:54,301
"And then the Romans come in
and they got me.

275
00:15:54,344 --> 00:15:57,478
"It all went tits up, Mom.

276
00:15:57,521 --> 00:15:59,784
"You must build a cathedral."
"I will build a cathedral.

277
00:15:59,828 --> 00:16:02,352
"What's a cathedral?" "I dunno,
I made it up in <i>Scrabble.</i>

278
00:16:04,572 --> 00:16:07,488
"300 points on a triple word."

279
00:16:07,531 --> 00:16:11,057
"I'll build one in Jerusalem."
"Not Jerusalem, no,
that's gonna be a nightmare

280
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,363
"with politics there.

281
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:16,410
"And traffic is bad. Um...

282
00:16:16,453 --> 00:16:18,673
"Paris, why not Paris?"
"Oh, Paris, why Paris?"

283
00:16:18,716 --> 00:16:20,240
"For the tourists." "Oh, yeah."

284
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:26,289
"Make it colder there, Mom.
I want it like a fridge."
"All right.

285
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:29,771
"I'll put yoghurt
and ham everywhere."
"Yes, yoghurt and ham.

286
00:16:29,814 --> 00:16:31,555
"That makes it a fridge.

287
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:36,821
"And also..." That's my fridge.

288
00:16:41,826 --> 00:16:44,394
Funnier than it was yesterday.

289
00:16:45,787 --> 00:16:49,138
"Yeah, yoghurt and ham,
Mom, and,

290
00:16:49,182 --> 00:16:52,141
"in the cathedral, put lots
of candles in the cathedral
as well.

291
00:16:52,185 --> 00:16:53,838
"Not too many, could burn down."

292
00:16:56,841 --> 00:16:59,148
Yeah, well,
the French firefighters,

293
00:16:59,192 --> 00:17:01,803
they saved that cathedral.
It's a beautiful building.

294
00:17:01,846 --> 00:17:04,762
And President Macron said
it'll be rebuilt in five years

295
00:17:04,806 --> 00:17:07,069
and I'm absolutely sure
they'll keep their word

296
00:17:07,113 --> 00:17:08,810
and it'll be rebuilt and be
even better than before.

297
00:17:08,853 --> 00:17:14,120
And it will have more
sprinkler systems
than you've ever seen.

298
00:17:14,163 --> 00:17:16,122
So, well done to them.
But I was in Notre Dame,

299
00:17:16,165 --> 00:17:18,385
a year ago I was there.
No, two years ago.

300
00:17:18,428 --> 00:17:21,214
Uh, no, five years ago,
I was there.

301
00:17:21,257 --> 00:17:23,085
I've never been there,
actually, but...

302
00:17:25,392 --> 00:17:28,395
No, of course, I was there,
I was there. No.

303
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:30,527
No, I have been there.

304
00:17:33,182 --> 00:17:35,489
No, of course. Everyone.
You go to Paris, you go to...

305
00:17:41,712 --> 00:17:44,063
I was there with
Engelbert Humperdinck last time.

306
00:17:45,151 --> 00:17:47,240
And Ziggova Bambleback
was there.

307
00:17:47,283 --> 00:17:49,590
And Slod Van Walle was there.

308
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:52,158
And I was talking to the priest, <i>
"Monsieur le</i> priest,

309
00:17:52,201 --> 00:17:53,768
<i>"vous avez beaucoup</i>
of the candles here.

310
00:17:53,811 --> 00:17:55,639
<i>"Mucho mucho.</i>

311
00:17:55,683 --> 00:17:59,208
"and my <i>question</i> to you is, <i>
warum haben Sie..."</i> German.

312
00:17:59,252 --> 00:18:01,689
"...all these candles
here, why?"

313
00:18:01,732 --> 00:18:03,865
And he wasn't smoking,
he was vaping.

314
00:18:09,436 --> 00:18:11,307
So much smoke in vaping.

315
00:18:11,351 --> 00:18:15,181
What is happening? It's like
a Hogwarts train of smoke,
isn't it?

316
00:18:15,224 --> 00:18:17,444
It has killed the film noir.

317
00:18:17,487 --> 00:18:20,186
Do you remember film noir, with
the cigarettes and hats on?

318
00:18:20,229 --> 00:18:23,145
"Kenny, you gotta get out
of town. Mr. Big's home."

319
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:24,668
"Mr. Big?

320
00:18:24,712 --> 00:18:26,801
"He's so big." "I know.

321
00:18:26,844 --> 00:18:28,890
"That's why
we call him Mr. Big.

322
00:18:28,933 --> 00:18:30,848
"He's gonna kill you, Kenny."

323
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:33,286
"Don't think so. Sticks
and stones may break my bones,

324
00:18:33,329 --> 00:18:35,288
"but names will never hurt me."

325
00:18:35,331 --> 00:18:37,159
"He's got a gun." "Ah, shit."

326
00:18:38,334 --> 00:18:40,815
With vaping? "Kenny, you gotta
get out of town.

327
00:18:40,858 --> 00:18:42,599
"Mr. Big's coming."

328
00:18:47,996 --> 00:18:50,520
"Fucking exploded, man."

329
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:52,261
"No, I'm still here."

330
00:18:54,394 --> 00:18:56,439
"You smell of vanilla."

331
00:19:00,226 --> 00:19:02,010
Yes, indeed. So, anyway,

332
00:19:02,053 --> 00:19:04,578
talking to the priest. <i>Monsieur</i> <i>
le</i> priest. He was there...

333
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:13,500
"Oh, you sell the... and it
raises money for religion?"

334
00:19:17,678 --> 00:19:22,204
<i>"Und pour acheter</i>
more of the blood of Christ and
body of Christ for communion."

335
00:19:22,248 --> 00:19:25,251
We've been eating
his body and drinking his blood
for 2,000 years

336
00:19:25,294 --> 00:19:27,557
and he wasn't that big
to begin with.

337
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:30,256
Which is true, in the strict
rules of the Catholic faith,

338
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:32,562
they are not eating a facsimile
of his body,

339
00:19:32,606 --> 00:19:34,999
they're eating his real body
and drinking his real blood

340
00:19:35,043 --> 00:19:37,393
in a cannibalistic,
vampiristic way

341
00:19:37,437 --> 00:19:40,440
that is never pointed out.

342
00:19:40,483 --> 00:19:42,790
And how tall was he?
How big was he?

343
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,271
Was the Sermon on the Mount
the Sermon of the Mount?

344
00:19:45,314 --> 00:19:48,230
Was he some sort of mountain
man and they keep...

345
00:19:48,274 --> 00:19:49,753
"Saw another bit off him.

346
00:19:49,797 --> 00:19:52,582
"Let's munch away at that
on Sundays."

347
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:55,585
But this new pope, the guy who
just became pope

348
00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:58,893
like ten years ago, I dunno.

349
00:19:58,936 --> 00:20:00,764
Somewhat... The latest pope.

350
00:20:00,808 --> 00:20:03,811
I like him, I think he's got
a different thing going on.

351
00:20:03,854 --> 00:20:06,292
He's much more South American
than the rest of them.

352
00:20:06,335 --> 00:20:10,557
Um, he's much more, <i>
"Buenas</i> fucking <i>noches,</i> guys!

353
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,298
"Hey, <i>ole!"</i>

354
00:20:12,341 --> 00:20:14,387
And, uh, he's changed things.

355
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,693
You know, because you have
the body of Christ

356
00:20:16,737 --> 00:20:19,827
and the blood old Christ,
and they used to get <i>vin de</i> <i>
table,</i> ordinary table wine.

357
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,959
They'd bless it and
it becomes... but now
they're using

358
00:20:22,003 --> 00:20:27,269
uh, Cotes du Rhone and
Pouilly-Fume, Burgundies, Beaujolais.

359
00:20:27,313 --> 00:20:29,315
Really fruity wines, you know?

360
00:20:29,358 --> 00:20:31,317
Strong, great tastes.

361
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,536
For the blood of Christ.
It's really working well.

362
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,756
The body of Christ, they're
using Focaccia bread

363
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:37,888
uh, sourdough breads.

364
00:20:37,932 --> 00:20:41,327
You know, very good breads
that you can get in Sainsbury's.

365
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:44,721
And, uh, and it's taken off.
There's queues around the block.

366
00:20:44,765 --> 00:20:46,767
Sunday mornings...
Have you seen the pictures?

367
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,595
Seven o'clock,
queues around the block

368
00:20:48,638 --> 00:20:51,641
for Notre Dame cathedral.
"Uh, blood of Christ, please,
large one.

369
00:20:57,343 --> 00:20:58,996
"Aah!

370
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,347
"Another one, please."

371
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:04,437
"Oh, it's one each,
I'm terribly sorry."

372
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,527
"Oh, this isn't a bar?
I thought it was a bar.

373
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,920
"They look like this
these days."

374
00:21:09,964 --> 00:21:11,313
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

375
00:21:11,357 --> 00:21:13,707
<i>"C'est formidable,</i>
the blood of Christ.

376
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:17,319
"Is the body of Christ close?
'Cause I'm a little bit
drunk now."

377
00:21:20,844 --> 00:21:22,846
"Thank you, two bits, please.

378
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:26,459
"One's for me and one's for
my religious friend. He's got
his foot stuck in a pew.

379
00:21:30,463 --> 00:21:32,769
"Do you have any butter?"

380
00:21:41,082 --> 00:21:43,954
"Thought that was a rule. No?
No worries.

381
00:21:43,998 --> 00:21:46,000
"Wipe on, wipe off.
Wipe on, wipe off.

382
00:21:46,043 --> 00:21:48,350
"Wipe on, wipe off."

383
00:21:48,394 --> 00:21:49,960
That's how it started.
Yeah, you see?

384
00:21:50,004 --> 00:21:52,093
'Cause when Christians,
the lions were going on,

385
00:21:52,136 --> 00:21:53,921
it was karate
that kept them going.

386
00:21:53,964 --> 00:21:55,662
"Wipe on, wipe off."

387
00:21:55,705 --> 00:21:58,142
They were all, <i>"Uh... Lion!"</i>

388
00:21:58,186 --> 00:22:00,493
That's how it all started.

389
00:22:01,972 --> 00:22:04,932
Because Father, Son and
Holy Ghost, that doesn't
make sense,

390
00:22:04,975 --> 00:22:08,109
'cause there's four points
to the cross and there's only
a Holy Trinity.

391
00:22:08,152 --> 00:22:10,894
Three into four don't go. Do you
remember your mathematics?

392
00:22:10,938 --> 00:22:13,114
Father, Son and Holy Ghost.
Who's that guy?

393
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:17,031
Is that Kenny?

394
00:22:20,121 --> 00:22:21,818
But they put on a service,
don't they?

395
00:22:21,862 --> 00:22:24,517
I dunno if you're Catholic
or you if you met
a Catholic once.

396
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,997
Some of my best friends
are Catholic.

397
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:29,609
Sorry, it's a thing people say.

398
00:22:29,652 --> 00:22:32,002
Well, in the old days it used to
matter, I grew up and

399
00:22:32,046 --> 00:22:34,483
I went to a boarding school
after Mum died.

400
00:22:34,527 --> 00:22:38,574
And there was one Catholic
kid in our... In these
boarding houses.

401
00:22:38,618 --> 00:22:40,968
And every Sunday, we'd have to
troop off to church

402
00:22:41,011 --> 00:22:43,057
to hear someone go, "And now...

403
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,712
"we shall read from the Book
of Death.

404
00:22:45,755 --> 00:22:48,149
"Chapters four to eight million.

405
00:22:48,192 --> 00:22:51,587
"And then Shadrac went
into a small pen

406
00:22:51,631 --> 00:22:53,981
"and he set fire
to his tonsils."

407
00:22:54,024 --> 00:22:56,679
And this went on and on and on.

408
00:22:56,723 --> 00:23:00,770
But the Catholic guy,
he had to go, "You can go off
to your own church."

409
00:23:00,814 --> 00:23:03,120
He could do whatever
he wanted, go down to the pub.

410
00:23:03,164 --> 00:23:05,688
It seemed a lot better to be
Catholic, you see.

411
00:23:05,732 --> 00:23:08,474
That was my
only frame of reference.

412
00:23:08,517 --> 00:23:10,911
Okay, I lost you all.
That's okay.

413
00:23:10,954 --> 00:23:13,000
It's just in the old days it was
Catholic against Protestant

414
00:23:13,043 --> 00:23:14,958
and they would burn
each other at the stake.

415
00:23:15,002 --> 00:23:17,483
And nowadays,
it's slightly different.

416
00:23:17,526 --> 00:23:19,572
But not in Glasgow.

417
00:23:21,051 --> 00:23:22,923
Where they'll try
and kill each other.

418
00:23:22,966 --> 00:23:27,231
But they put on a service,
don't they? In the Catholic
faith, they've got

419
00:23:27,275 --> 00:23:29,973
carpets, tapestries,
stained-glass windows.

420
00:23:30,017 --> 00:23:32,715
Someone sets fire to a handbag,
they spin that round,

421
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:35,501
that always looks fun.

422
00:23:35,544 --> 00:23:37,894
The priests, they often talk
in Latin.

423
00:23:37,938 --> 00:23:41,158
No one understands Latin,
it's a clever idea.

424
00:23:41,202 --> 00:23:43,160
'Cause it means the priests
can make mistakes

425
00:23:43,204 --> 00:23:45,293
and no one knows.

426
00:23:45,336 --> 00:23:48,992
Patris et Filii et Spiritus <i>
Sancti. Cumulonimbus.</i>

427
00:23:49,036 --> 00:23:52,996
<i>Stratocumulus.</i> <i>
Cominangonis baked potatus.</i>

428
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,999
<i>Inspectum Patronum.</i>

429
00:23:56,043 --> 00:23:59,002
<i>Rubber duckus, cor blimus.</i>

430
00:23:59,046 --> 00:24:01,004
But as you probably
know, the French

431
00:24:01,048 --> 00:24:05,574
are lapsed Catholics, whereas
we in the United Kingdom
are lapsed Protestants.

432
00:24:05,618 --> 00:24:08,708
We have cathedrals as well,
but they're full of nothing.

433
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:11,232
Because King Henry VIII,
he took it all

434
00:24:11,275 --> 00:24:13,539
when he split from
the Catholic faith.

435
00:24:13,582 --> 00:24:16,629
So, this was back in
the year 15...

436
00:24:18,674 --> 00:24:20,981
Henry VIII was born
in 15...

437
00:24:22,112 --> 00:24:25,202
And he became king in 15...
farther, bit later.

438
00:24:26,813 --> 00:24:32,601
And he split from the Catholic
faith in 15... sometime after.

439
00:24:32,645 --> 00:24:36,605
Now, Henry, he said,
"We're going to separate from
the Catholic church"

440
00:24:36,649 --> 00:24:38,607
and they stripped
all the Catholic churches.

441
00:24:38,651 --> 00:24:40,827
"We'll take everything, the gold
and tapestries."

442
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,524
They took
all the precious stuff down

443
00:24:42,568 --> 00:24:43,960
and said, "King,
what do we do with it?"

444
00:24:44,004 --> 00:24:46,267
He said, "Put it in
a blender, I'm going to eat it.

445
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:50,532
'Cause he had this
eating disorder called
"munch too much." And...

446
00:24:50,576 --> 00:24:54,623
Some of us have this
in this world, some of us eat
and when we are sated,

447
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:57,147
when our hunger is sated, we go,
'That's enough for me."

448
00:24:57,191 --> 00:25:00,586
But Henry VIII, he ate cake mix
and cakes and trees,

449
00:25:00,629 --> 00:25:02,762
helicopters, baked potatoes, ratatouille,

450
00:25:02,805 --> 00:25:04,677
swans, uh...

451
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,722
people from outer space, anything.

452
00:25:06,766 --> 00:25:09,595
He was just... on and on and on.

453
00:25:09,638 --> 00:25:11,727
You've seen these menus
that the kings would eat.

454
00:25:11,771 --> 00:25:14,295
And he became a large lad.

455
00:25:14,338 --> 00:25:16,819
And he married six women,
he married Catherine of Aragon

456
00:25:16,863 --> 00:25:18,908
very arrogant,
that's why she was called that.

457
00:25:18,952 --> 00:25:20,606
Second wife was Anne Boleyn,

458
00:25:20,649 --> 00:25:22,825
who invented the Bowline knot,
very good climber.

459
00:25:22,869 --> 00:25:26,220
Would've climbed Everest but she
didn't know where it was.

460
00:25:26,263 --> 00:25:30,659
Third wife was Sally
from Birmingham, I believe.

461
00:25:30,703 --> 00:25:32,618
She died in a harpoon accident.

462
00:25:32,661 --> 00:25:35,577
Yes, 'cause Henry had been
watching, uh,

463
00:25:35,621 --> 00:25:37,274
<i>Dr. No</i> and <i>Thunderball,</i>

464
00:25:37,318 --> 00:25:39,059
which were medieval plays
at the time.

465
00:25:39,102 --> 00:25:42,062
And in <i>Thunderball,</i> there's
a harpoon scene...

466
00:25:42,105 --> 00:25:45,108
"Ooh, she got the point,"
and that's, uh...

467
00:25:45,152 --> 00:25:47,589
You're not going for this,
are you? But it's true.

468
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:49,069
It's true.

469
00:25:49,112 --> 00:25:51,593
Fourth wife was Scottish,
Lady Macbeth.

470
00:25:51,637 --> 00:25:52,855
She was always cleaning.

471
00:25:52,899 --> 00:25:55,684
"Just get the blood off this
carpet, Henry.

472
00:25:55,728 --> 00:25:57,904
"Bit of blood on the ceiling
here, as well."

473
00:25:57,947 --> 00:26:00,646
So, he divorced her,
he was scared of her.

474
00:26:00,689 --> 00:26:02,865
Fifth wife had no name,

475
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:04,345
she was from spaghetti westerns

476
00:26:04,388 --> 00:26:07,696
and he lost her down the back
of the sofa one day.

477
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,655
"I can't find her anywhere."

478
00:26:09,698 --> 00:26:12,701
Sixth wife was Elizabeth.
Of course, she's still
on the throne.

479
00:26:12,745 --> 00:26:14,834
And...

480
00:26:14,877 --> 00:26:16,966
Five hundred years old,
doing very well.

481
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,707
Lost the muscles in her smile,

482
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:21,623
but she's a fighter.
She's a game-bird.

483
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:24,147
So, those were the six wives
of Henry VIII.

484
00:26:24,191 --> 00:26:27,847
And Henry VIII of course died,
he exploded. That's how he died.

485
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:31,633
As you well know,
he ate a mint and exploded.

486
00:26:31,677 --> 00:26:35,158
"Really, was it a big mint
stuck in his throat?"
No, it was a thin mint.

487
00:26:35,202 --> 00:26:37,291
Almost wafer-thin,
some people say.

488
00:26:38,901 --> 00:26:42,209
So, yes, these
are all true things.

489
00:26:42,252 --> 00:26:45,691
But many English kings,
as you probably know,
have exploded.

490
00:26:45,734 --> 00:26:48,868
Henry VIII, exploded,
William the Conqueror, exploded.

491
00:26:48,911 --> 00:26:52,088
King Kenny IX, exploded.

492
00:26:52,132 --> 00:26:55,004
Okay, two kings. That's quite
a lot of kings, isn't it?

493
00:26:55,048 --> 00:26:57,180
So, William the Conqui-bum,
he did explode.

494
00:26:57,224 --> 00:26:59,269
He did, he did, he did.
That's what happened.

495
00:26:59,313 --> 00:27:01,228
So, this is all 1066 stuff.

496
00:27:01,271 --> 00:27:03,273
And 1066, an important date

497
00:27:03,317 --> 00:27:05,188
for the English,
not the British.

498
00:27:05,232 --> 00:27:08,714
Because we lose
the Battle of Hastings in 1066,

499
00:27:08,757 --> 00:27:10,672
but we won
the World Cup that year.

500
00:27:10,716 --> 00:27:13,022
So...

501
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:15,329
Swings and round-abouts.

502
00:27:15,372 --> 00:27:18,680
A thousand years ago since
we won the football World Cup,

503
00:27:18,724 --> 00:27:22,423
that's how long it seems to us.

504
00:27:22,466 --> 00:27:26,122
But this is all William
of Normandy, back in
the north of France.

505
00:27:26,166 --> 00:27:27,254
Before 1066.

506
00:27:27,297 --> 00:27:28,734
He was eight years old

507
00:27:28,777 --> 00:27:31,998
when he inherited
the dukedom of Normandy.

508
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:35,915
This is the power list
in the old days, it was king,
most powerful, then Duke,

509
00:27:35,958 --> 00:27:39,745
then Earl, Baron, Viscount...

510
00:27:39,788 --> 00:27:41,834
Bloke in a hedge. Okay?

511
00:27:41,877 --> 00:27:43,792
So, it's right up there.

512
00:27:43,836 --> 00:27:46,882
Very powerful position,
and he was eight. And he was
an illegitimate child.

513
00:27:46,926 --> 00:27:48,405
A bastard child.

514
00:27:48,449 --> 00:27:51,365
His father was Robert
the Magnificent, amazing name.

515
00:27:51,408 --> 00:27:53,410
He was obviously very good
at karaoke.

516
00:27:53,454 --> 00:27:59,242
And when singing one evening,
he obviously fell over
on a spike and died.

517
00:27:59,286 --> 00:28:01,331
And he'd had a child
with a hairdresser,

518
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:02,768
I believe she was.

519
00:28:02,811 --> 00:28:05,509
Called Veronique
or Sally or Jeff.

520
00:28:05,553 --> 00:28:08,904
And... <i>"Bonjour.</i> Hello.

521
00:28:08,948 --> 00:28:10,819
"What do you do?"
"I am a slave."

522
00:28:10,863 --> 00:28:14,127
"Oh, the Middle Ages, yeah.
What can you do?

523
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:16,782
"All right, I'll give you short
back and sides.

524
00:28:16,825 --> 00:28:20,742
"Give you one of those
weird haircuts like in
the Bayeux Tapestry.

525
00:28:20,786 --> 00:28:23,179
"So, what you doing
the weekend?"
"Working, I'm a slave."

526
00:28:23,223 --> 00:28:24,703
"Oh, yeah. Slavery.

527
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:27,880
"What am I like?

528
00:28:27,923 --> 00:28:29,490
"So, where are you going
on your holidays?"

529
00:28:29,533 --> 00:28:31,274
"Nowhere. Slavery." "Oh, yes.

530
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:35,844
"I'll just shut up, shall I?"

531
00:28:35,888 --> 00:28:38,151
So, this eight-year-old gets
the dukedom of Normandy

532
00:28:38,194 --> 00:28:40,283
and all the barons and viscounts
are pissed off,

533
00:28:40,327 --> 00:28:43,330
going, "Why has this
bastard child inherited
the Duke of Normandy?

534
00:28:43,373 --> 00:28:46,072
"I should be
the Duke of Normandy.
I am Baron Kenny,

535
00:28:46,115 --> 00:28:47,943
"from over there,
left of the chip shop.

536
00:28:47,987 --> 00:28:51,294
"I should be..."
"No, I am Viscount Steve Claude,

537
00:28:51,338 --> 00:28:53,427
"from over the hills
and not too far away."

538
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:58,388
"Okay, well, one of us,
one of the aristocracy,
not that eight-year-old

539
00:28:58,432 --> 00:29:00,434
"illegitimate child,
what can we do?"

540
00:29:00,477 --> 00:29:02,218
"We could kill him."

541
00:29:02,262 --> 00:29:05,134
"Is that legal?" "You fool,
this is the Middle Ages.

542
00:29:05,178 --> 00:29:08,268
"Laws are fuzzy at the moment."

543
00:29:08,311 --> 00:29:11,488
"Very well, I will kill him
with a knife. No, I will kill
him with a fork.

544
00:29:11,532 --> 00:29:13,447
"No, I will kill him
with a spoon."

545
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:15,231
"Can you kill people
with spoons?"

546
00:29:15,275 --> 00:29:18,104
"I killed Humpty Dumpty
that way.

547
00:29:18,147 --> 00:29:21,934
"And all the king's horses and
all the king's men, couldn't put
Humpty together again."

548
00:29:21,977 --> 00:29:24,850
"Yes, I did hear this.

549
00:29:24,893 --> 00:29:27,809
"I always wanted to ask you,
why did you ask
all the king's horses

550
00:29:27,853 --> 00:29:30,246
"to try and put Humpty
together again?

551
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:33,902
"That seemed like a waste
of an afternoon."

552
00:29:33,946 --> 00:29:38,602
"We were testing whether hooves
were good tools to reassemble
eggs that had been broken."

553
00:29:38,646 --> 00:29:40,387
"What were your findings?"
"Not good."

554
00:29:42,868 --> 00:29:44,913
So, they decided to try
and kill the kid.

555
00:29:44,957 --> 00:29:47,916
Now this is true.
All this, everything I've said
so far is true.

556
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,137
Not the Humpty Dumpty bit,
but everything else, right?

557
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,879
So, for ten years,
they try and kill this kid.

558
00:29:56,403 --> 00:29:58,927
On and on...

559
00:29:58,971 --> 00:30:02,191
And he survived for ten years.

560
00:30:02,235 --> 00:30:05,629
He survived 'cause
he learned Krav Maga. Yes, yes.

561
00:30:05,673 --> 00:30:08,632
Martial arts is 95 percent
martial, five percent art.

562
00:30:08,676 --> 00:30:12,158
And that's what he did.

563
00:30:12,201 --> 00:30:15,988
And basically,
you hit people with things,
that's what you do in Krav Maga.

564
00:30:16,031 --> 00:30:18,381
When they're coming towards
you, very Jason Bourne-ish,

565
00:30:18,425 --> 00:30:21,602
you reach out,
grab a frying pan...

566
00:30:21,645 --> 00:30:24,126
A lot of frying pan moves
in Krav Maga,

567
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:29,305
which you can see, they all
came from the Looney Tunes
documentaries that Chuck Jones

568
00:30:29,349 --> 00:30:31,873
directed for Warner Bros.
in the '30s.

569
00:30:31,917 --> 00:30:35,572
So, yes, so he survives.
He wins the Battle of
Val-es-Dunes in Normandy.

570
00:30:35,616 --> 00:30:38,227
Which is very famous
in Val-es-Dunes.

571
00:30:38,271 --> 00:30:42,536
And he goes to his mom for
another haircut. "How'd it go?"
"I killed them all, Mom."

572
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:45,974
"Excellent, well done.
How did you do this?"
"I learned Krav Maga."

573
00:30:46,018 --> 00:30:47,454
"How did you learn that?"
"I bought

574
00:30:47,497 --> 00:30:50,544
"these tapes off a monkey
for two bananas each."

575
00:30:50,587 --> 00:30:52,502
"Very clever.
So, now you have a rest?"

576
00:30:52,546 --> 00:30:54,069
"No. I'm going to
invade England."

577
00:30:54,113 --> 00:30:56,245
"You fool.
You don't have a navy."

578
00:30:56,289 --> 00:31:00,380
He says, "Oh, no." And he runs
down to the army and navy stores
and he goes in, "Hello.

579
00:31:00,423 --> 00:31:04,384
"Do you have any navies left?"
"Well, we have one left.

580
00:31:04,427 --> 00:31:07,082
"We can give you inflatable
mattresses and some pedal boats.

581
00:31:07,126 --> 00:31:09,389
"We got rowing boats,
and one or two speedboats."

582
00:31:09,432 --> 00:31:11,260
"How do they work,
this new speedboat thing?"

583
00:31:11,304 --> 00:31:14,220
"Well, they're just rowboats,
but we've nailed ducks
to the bottom."

584
00:31:15,961 --> 00:31:17,527
"And does it go very fast?"

585
00:31:17,571 --> 00:31:20,530
"Well, you have to get
all your ducks in a row.
But then..."

586
00:31:21,662 --> 00:31:22,968
Fuck off. Now...

587
00:31:26,058 --> 00:31:28,712
Getting a "ducks in a row"
joke into a

588
00:31:28,756 --> 00:31:32,238
piece about 1066, that's...

589
00:31:32,281 --> 00:31:34,675
That doesn't happen every day.
So, fuck off.

590
00:31:36,024 --> 00:31:40,333
No, no, too late, too late.
No, too late.

591
00:31:40,376 --> 00:31:42,639
So, this is 1066.
Bayeux Tapestry stuff,

592
00:31:42,683 --> 00:31:44,467
all the weavers were there
at the battle.

593
00:31:44,511 --> 00:31:48,645
"Slow it down, please.
It's not a bloody video.

594
00:31:48,689 --> 00:31:50,386
"All right, eyes and teeth.

595
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:52,954
"Just leave them down here.
We'll put 'em in later."

596
00:31:52,998 --> 00:31:56,653
And Harold, famously,
Harold of England died with
a frying pan through the eye,

597
00:31:56,697 --> 00:31:58,438
you've all seen that image.

598
00:31:58,481 --> 00:32:02,007
And King William becomes
King of England for 20 years

599
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:05,140
and he eats cats and dogs
and trees and helicopters,
baked potatoes,

600
00:32:05,184 --> 00:32:07,708
ratatouille and he becomes huge.

601
00:32:07,751 --> 00:32:10,711
And then in his dying days,
he says, "I will go

602
00:32:10,754 --> 00:32:13,670
"back to Normandy today.
I'll go to the city of Rouen.

603
00:32:13,714 --> 00:32:19,111
"The English will not follow me
to Rouen, because they can't
pronounce Rouen."

604
00:32:19,154 --> 00:32:20,503
I can't, it's very difficult.

605
00:32:20,547 --> 00:32:21,983
And he's there,
he's lying in a bed,

606
00:32:22,027 --> 00:32:24,029
wheezing away, dying,
and he is not beloved,

607
00:32:24,072 --> 00:32:26,205
he's be-hated.
It's like Stalin dying.

608
00:32:26,248 --> 00:32:30,296
It's not nice, but all the
pretenders to the dukedom,
they were all coming going,

609
00:32:30,339 --> 00:32:34,039
"How are you doing, Guillaume?
Are you okey-dokey,
or are you nokey-dokey?

610
00:32:34,082 --> 00:32:38,608
"I will pokey-pokey to test
your okey-dokeyness.

611
00:32:38,652 --> 00:32:40,610
"We'll do the frying pan test."

612
00:32:42,134 --> 00:32:44,397
And he's dead.
He's dead there in the bed.

613
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,747
So they all run away
because they hate him
and they just leave him.

614
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:50,446
They don't bury him and he's
there for about two or three
weeks and that's not good.

615
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:54,537
Because, you know, when you die,
you stop, but you know,
the tummy keeps going.

616
00:32:54,581 --> 00:32:57,323
The tummy is like the engine
room from the <i>Titanic.</i>

617
00:32:57,366 --> 00:33:01,022
People are going, "Come on,
no news is good news, lads."

618
00:33:03,111 --> 00:33:05,766
And the tummy keeps making gas.

619
00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:08,551
And so the archbishop came up
and said, "My God, he's huge!

620
00:33:08,595 --> 00:33:11,772
"Oh, this is terrible. We must
get him to the church on time.

621
00:33:11,815 --> 00:33:14,209
"Come on, Kenny, Veronique,
help me.

622
00:33:14,253 --> 00:33:16,081
<i>"Monsieur</i> Magoo,
can we use your car?"

623
00:33:16,124 --> 00:33:17,560
And with the help
of <i>Monsieur</i> Magoo,

624
00:33:17,604 --> 00:33:19,780
who was... his eyesight
was not that great,

625
00:33:19,823 --> 00:33:22,783
they got him to the cathedral
in Caen within seven years.

626
00:33:22,826 --> 00:33:25,351
And... probably quicker.

627
00:33:25,394 --> 00:33:28,441
Thank you for laughing,
three people. And...

628
00:33:28,484 --> 00:33:31,835
He's there and they do
a service. <i>In nomine Patris</i> <i>
et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.</i>

629
00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:36,101
Inspectum patronum!

630
00:33:36,144 --> 00:33:39,278
"We're here to bury the kid,
Duke of Normandy,
the King of England.

631
00:33:39,321 --> 00:33:42,107
"What a guy.
What has he achieved,
as we lower him into a coffin.

632
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,673
"Just push down gently there.

633
00:33:43,717 --> 00:33:46,328
"And we say goodbye, old fellow.

634
00:33:46,372 --> 00:33:49,592
"Amazing things you've done.
What can we say, as we get
the lid and we push

635
00:33:49,636 --> 00:33:52,682
"down quite heavily
upon the lid, and...

636
00:33:52,726 --> 00:33:55,642
"Get some butter, I don't know.

637
00:33:55,685 --> 00:34:01,648
"As we lie ourselves
over the coffin like
Nancy Reagan

638
00:34:01,691 --> 00:34:06,783
"and try and push down
upon the..." They couldn't
get him in. This is all true.

639
00:34:06,827 --> 00:34:09,264
And he burst, basically.

640
00:34:09,308 --> 00:34:11,397
Yeah. Yeah, check it up.

641
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,442
And the gas came out,

642
00:34:13,486 --> 00:34:15,792
it made a sound a bit like, <i>
"Bonjour."</i>

643
00:34:18,665 --> 00:34:21,363
The smell apparently
was 149 out of ten

644
00:34:21,407 --> 00:34:27,369
and they apparently did
the fastest last rites ceremony
in the history of Catholicism.

645
00:34:27,413 --> 00:34:30,546
<i>In nomine Patris...</i>
Open the fucking <i>fenetres...</i>

646
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:33,114
Give me some dog poo,
some dog poo, thank you.

647
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,642
King of England,
Duke of Normandy, what did
he do? Lots of stuff.

648
00:34:39,686 --> 00:34:41,340
All right, put him in a bin.

649
00:34:41,383 --> 00:34:43,385
And they flicked him
out the window.

650
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:47,259
And he spun in the air,
held for a second and then fell
splosh into a pond

651
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:50,088
and came third in the Normandy
diving competition.

652
00:34:53,482 --> 00:34:54,918
True story.

653
00:34:58,226 --> 00:35:01,882
I was talking about human beings
before. Now, that's us.

654
00:35:01,925 --> 00:35:04,580
And if you are a human being,
which I assume you are,

655
00:35:04,624 --> 00:35:07,235
very few Martians in tonight.

656
00:35:07,279 --> 00:35:10,238
We don't... we take ourselves
for granted,

657
00:35:10,282 --> 00:35:12,545
we don't think of ourselves
as interesting but we are.

658
00:35:12,588 --> 00:35:15,243
We were just one of
the natural animals in the world

659
00:35:15,287 --> 00:35:18,681
and then we separated.
We became civilized.

660
00:35:18,725 --> 00:35:21,597
They stayed wild.
So, that was the separation.

661
00:35:21,641 --> 00:35:24,209
But they kept fitness with them,
but we kept cake

662
00:35:24,252 --> 00:35:26,211
and daytime television.

663
00:35:26,254 --> 00:35:28,256
That was the deal we did.

664
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,259
They are so fit, aren't they?
Like tigers...

665
00:35:33,957 --> 00:35:37,178
If they're hunting, they creep
up with their Pilates

666
00:35:37,222 --> 00:35:39,049
slash yoga.

667
00:35:39,093 --> 00:35:43,228
Creepy-crawly.
It's amazing and they attack
with the speed of a train.

668
00:35:43,271 --> 00:35:47,275
You never see a crap tiger, have
you? You never see a tiger...

669
00:35:57,807 --> 00:36:00,767
"What's that, mate? No,
the hunt. I'm ready for
the hunt, I'm always ready.

670
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:02,334
Born ready, I'm a tiger.

671
00:36:02,377 --> 00:36:04,336
"Yeah, oh, they're going...

672
00:36:06,381 --> 00:36:07,730
"Shouldn't have done that.

673
00:36:07,774 --> 00:36:10,951
"Hang on.
I've just burnt my foot.

674
00:36:10,994 --> 00:36:14,346
"Padre, you got any Savlon?
Plasters?

675
00:36:15,303 --> 00:36:16,957
"Save a bit for me!

676
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,828
"Yeah, no, uh...

677
00:36:18,872 --> 00:36:21,614
"Buffalo wing...

678
00:36:21,657 --> 00:36:25,313
"Not gonna get
any breakfast now.
This is no good. Tony!

679
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:33,016
"Bring us a couple of boxes,
will you mate?

680
00:36:34,235 --> 00:36:37,325
"The one with a free armchair,
yeah, one of that."

681
00:36:37,369 --> 00:36:40,546
You remember the old days,
when we used to read
the cereal packets

682
00:36:40,589 --> 00:36:42,678
as if they were mobile phones?

683
00:36:42,722 --> 00:36:45,725
God, we would read
the whole of that thing.

684
00:36:45,768 --> 00:36:48,380
We're eating our food and going,

685
00:36:48,423 --> 00:36:51,034
"Riboflavin, thiamine
and niacin.

686
00:36:51,078 --> 00:36:54,560
"I am so glad to have
got that stuff inside me."

687
00:36:54,603 --> 00:36:58,346
Those cereals are full of
riboflavin, thiamine and niacin.

688
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:02,481
And in my teenage years,
I thought, "These are important
things to get inside you."

689
00:37:02,524 --> 00:37:06,354
And in my adult years,
I've never once heard
anyone say, "This kid is dying!

690
00:37:06,398 --> 00:37:08,661
"Get a shovelful of riboflavin
inside of him."

691
00:37:10,402 --> 00:37:12,273
Just they're not mentioned,
are they? What are they?

692
00:37:13,361 --> 00:37:15,755
Ah, but anyway, the fitness

693
00:37:15,798 --> 00:37:17,800
intrigued me,
of the wild animals.

694
00:37:17,844 --> 00:37:19,976
When I realized
that they were all fit.

695
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:24,590
So, in 2009, what I thought was
I am going to try and get some
of that fitness back,

696
00:37:24,633 --> 00:37:26,635
because as a kid,
I was a run-about-y kid

697
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:29,421
and I thought, "I want some
of that back." So, I started
running these marathons

698
00:37:29,464 --> 00:37:31,336
and I ran 43 in 51 days

699
00:37:31,379 --> 00:37:34,426
in the UK and 27 marathons
in 27 days in South Africa.

700
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,869
Now, I'm only mentioning them
in order to big myself up.

701
00:37:44,784 --> 00:37:46,438
But they seem quite impressive.

702
00:37:46,481 --> 00:37:48,527
They're somewhat
impressive, they're not
that impressive,

703
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,616
but my theory is,
anything I can do,

704
00:37:50,659 --> 00:37:53,096
you can do bett... Anything
I can do, you can do similar.

705
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:56,361
Anything I can do, you can do
a little bit worse, hopefully.

706
00:37:56,404 --> 00:37:59,364
Otherwise it'll make what I did
look so easy.

707
00:37:59,407 --> 00:38:01,366
But the first ten marathons
are hard.

708
00:38:01,409 --> 00:38:04,064
If you do multiple marathons,
ten in a row, that is hard.

709
00:38:04,107 --> 00:38:07,372
After that, it gets easier
because the brain is... "Ah,

710
00:38:07,415 --> 00:38:09,983
"we do marathons,
that's what we do."

711
00:38:10,026 --> 00:38:11,680
That's why the first ten
are hard.

712
00:38:11,724 --> 00:38:14,422
So, if you're ever doing
that, just...

713
00:38:14,466 --> 00:38:17,773
Just do ten and then you're...

714
00:38:17,817 --> 00:38:19,688
But I made it an adventure.
That's another thing.

715
00:38:19,732 --> 00:38:23,779
If life is hard, if whatever
you're doing is hard,
make it an adventure.

716
00:38:23,823 --> 00:38:26,608
There's always down bits
as well as up bits.

717
00:38:26,652 --> 00:38:28,741
And it's easier to deal with
because adventures,

718
00:38:28,784 --> 00:38:30,743
then there will be
a story about it.

719
00:38:30,786 --> 00:38:32,397
You could regale
people at night.

720
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,877
"Did I tell you when I had to go
down to the shops

721
00:38:34,921 --> 00:38:36,401
"and get soup?

722
00:38:36,444 --> 00:38:38,881
"And it was terribly difficult.

723
00:38:38,925 --> 00:38:41,928
"Because there was a force
three gale wind..."

724
00:38:42,755 --> 00:38:44,626
Just something.

725
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:47,586
That doesn't quite work.
Force three,
that's just a gentle wind.

726
00:38:49,544 --> 00:38:52,025
That's not a gale, is it?
Anyway, so,

727
00:38:52,068 --> 00:38:55,376
I was thinking, when did I have
my first adventure? And it was
with my mother.

728
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:58,510
Now, my mom and dad
met in the city of Aden

729
00:38:58,553 --> 00:38:59,815
in the country of Yemen.

730
00:38:59,859 --> 00:39:01,730
And it was a British colony.

731
00:39:01,774 --> 00:39:05,517
The British, we took it.
We took the port of Aden.

732
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,434
The British called it Aiden but
it's a bit weird, they obviously
got there and said...

733
00:39:09,477 --> 00:39:11,740
Our ancestors got there
and said, "Hi.

734
00:39:11,784 --> 00:39:14,700
"Where's this place?"
"This place is Aden."

735
00:39:14,743 --> 00:39:17,616
"Well, we'd like to own it."
"Oh."

736
00:39:17,659 --> 00:39:21,881
"We're going to call it Aiden."
"But it's Aden."

737
00:39:21,924 --> 00:39:24,710
"No, we'll call it Aiden.
Brighter A."

738
00:39:24,753 --> 00:39:28,148
"Well, it is actually Aden."
"Do you have a flag?"

739
00:39:31,194 --> 00:39:34,372
So, I think it was that basis,
the fact that we had flags
and guns.

740
00:39:36,069 --> 00:39:37,766
Where's this fucking fly?

741
00:39:39,638 --> 00:39:43,468
We got hair spray for the fly,
we haven't got fly spray.

742
00:39:43,511 --> 00:39:45,121
So, at some point,

743
00:39:45,165 --> 00:39:49,561
I will destroy the fly,
but he's moving quite fast.

744
00:39:49,604 --> 00:39:51,127
Anyway, I'll give him
a lot of hair spray.

745
00:39:51,171 --> 00:39:53,434
And then he'll either go,
"Hey, this looks great."

746
00:39:55,262 --> 00:39:58,221
Or he'll go, "I can't fly
anymore, I'm all sticky."

747
00:40:00,528 --> 00:40:02,617
Can't see him now.
Okay, here we go.

748
00:40:02,661 --> 00:40:06,447
Um, so... What was I... Oh, yes.

749
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,538
So, my parents met in Aden,
in Yemen,

750
00:40:10,582 --> 00:40:12,975
and they were married there
in '59,

751
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:15,151
and my brother was born in '60,
I was born in '62.

752
00:40:15,195 --> 00:40:18,851
And then we left in '63, Dad
said, "We gotta get out of here,
there's a revolution coming.

753
00:40:18,894 --> 00:40:21,201
"We're gonna go
to Northern Ireland."
"All right, Dad."

754
00:40:22,507 --> 00:40:24,683
Yes.

755
00:40:24,726 --> 00:40:28,774
Now, we got to Northern Ireland
in '63, we left in '67, just
before it all kicked off in '69.

756
00:40:28,817 --> 00:40:32,952
We always left before
everything kicked off. That was
kind of an Izzard trait.

757
00:40:32,995 --> 00:40:35,781
Not planning, just,
Dad just kept moving

758
00:40:35,824 --> 00:40:37,565
and things started happening.

759
00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:39,828
Um, not because of us,
we didn't do anything.

760
00:40:41,569 --> 00:40:43,615
Now, we sounded like this,
this is my point.

761
00:40:43,658 --> 00:40:46,182
From the south-east of England,
you get to Northern Ireland,

762
00:40:46,226 --> 00:40:49,490
um, and Mom sounds like this
and my brother sounds like this.

763
00:40:49,534 --> 00:40:51,623
And all the local kids are,
"Who are you?

764
00:40:51,666 --> 00:40:54,234
"What are you doing here?
Are you from Yemen?

765
00:40:54,277 --> 00:40:58,543
"Is that south of the border?
I think that is.

766
00:40:58,586 --> 00:41:01,110
"We're gonna throw mud at cars,
wanna throw mud at cars?"

767
00:41:02,198 --> 00:41:04,462
"Uh, yeah, okay." And...

768
00:41:05,767 --> 00:41:08,553
And I was into sugar,
I loved sugar.

769
00:41:08,596 --> 00:41:10,816
You know, recovering
sugar-holic, now.

770
00:41:10,859 --> 00:41:14,820
And most of my day in my
youngers years was spent going,

771
00:41:14,863 --> 00:41:17,692
"Mummy, can I have a glass
of lemonade? Can I have another
glass of lemonade, Mummy?

772
00:41:17,736 --> 00:41:22,523
"Can I get a bottle of lemonade
strapped to my head and
drip-fed into me?"

773
00:41:22,567 --> 00:41:26,222
After three months, it changed.
I was going, "Mother!

774
00:41:27,876 --> 00:41:30,096
"Can I get
a glass of lemonade, now?

775
00:41:30,139 --> 00:41:33,969
"I think that would be
sufficient to quench my thirst.

776
00:41:36,015 --> 00:41:38,539
"And in the negotiations
between you

777
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:42,021
"as my mother and I as a child,

778
00:41:42,064 --> 00:41:47,287
"I feel a glass of lemonade
would ease the passage
of detente

779
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:49,637
"and make this agreement work
and function,

780
00:41:49,681 --> 00:41:53,206
"in a way of the socio-economic
situation at the moment.

781
00:41:53,249 --> 00:41:57,297
"I dunno what I'm talking about
here, but get us a glass
of lemonade, will you?

782
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,604
"Ulster says yes to lemonade,

783
00:41:59,647 --> 00:42:01,562
"and no to not lemonade."

784
00:42:05,218 --> 00:42:08,743
So, apparently my mother
was freaked out by this.

785
00:42:08,787 --> 00:42:11,659
And so, she encouraged...
'cause if your parents
sound one thing

786
00:42:11,703 --> 00:42:13,661
and the kids sound different,
that's a little odd.

787
00:42:13,705 --> 00:42:17,186
So, my mother was probably
encouraging us to,

788
00:42:20,102 --> 00:42:23,018
"How now brown cow."

789
00:42:25,934 --> 00:42:29,634
Anyway, we stayed in the fold
of sounding like this.

790
00:42:29,677 --> 00:42:30,939
But, um,

791
00:42:30,983 --> 00:42:34,726
we would sound Irish
outside of the house

792
00:42:34,769 --> 00:42:37,729
and English inside the house.
We would code switch
at the front door.

793
00:42:37,772 --> 00:42:40,601
A friend of the family
just told me this, this year.

794
00:42:40,645 --> 00:42:43,386
My dad never told me that.
My dad had told him

795
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:45,127
that he'd listen at the door
and could hear us

796
00:42:45,171 --> 00:42:47,608
talking Irish outside the house,
with an Irish accent,

797
00:42:47,652 --> 00:42:49,175
and English inside the house.

798
00:42:49,218 --> 00:42:51,351
So, probably after six months,

799
00:42:51,394 --> 00:42:54,006
I was going, "Mummy, can I have
another glass of lemonade?

800
00:42:54,049 --> 00:42:56,661
"Thank you. Oh, does
anybody else, outside? Okay.

801
00:42:56,704 --> 00:42:59,620
"Anybody else want
a glass of lemonade there?

802
00:42:59,664 --> 00:43:01,709
"Seamus, Headey, Kenny?

803
00:43:03,319 --> 00:43:06,627
"Stevie Nicks, Patrick Pearse?

804
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,238
"Konrad Ardenauer?

805
00:43:09,282 --> 00:43:10,936
"The Pope?

806
00:43:10,979 --> 00:43:14,330
"Stevie Nicks and the Pope
would like a glass of red wine.

807
00:43:14,374 --> 00:43:16,332
"Everyone else would rather have
milk and coffee."

808
00:43:18,204 --> 00:43:21,381
And then my brother went off
in 1965

809
00:43:21,424 --> 00:43:23,383
to Ballyholme primary school

810
00:43:23,426 --> 00:43:25,124
to practice his vowels.

811
00:43:25,167 --> 00:43:27,779
And I was left at home with Mum,

812
00:43:27,822 --> 00:43:30,433
and she said one day,
"We're gonna go on an adventure.
"An adventure, Mum?

813
00:43:30,477 --> 00:43:32,697
"How do we do that?"
"You're gonna get on
your brother's bicycle.

814
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,829
"We put the training wheels
back on, the stabilizers.

815
00:43:34,873 --> 00:43:38,441
"And we're gonna put a little
box at the back, get provisions
from the local shops."

816
00:43:38,485 --> 00:43:40,052
That was my first adventure.

817
00:43:40,095 --> 00:43:42,663
And off I went on a little
bicycle with little
training wheels.

818
00:43:54,283 --> 00:43:57,199
If you remember, ten degrees
to the vertical.
That's how we do it.

819
00:43:57,243 --> 00:43:59,767
It's supposed to get you in
the middle, didn't it?

820
00:43:59,811 --> 00:44:02,074
Bu you just didn't trust
that middle bit, so you'd...

821
00:44:07,949 --> 00:44:11,126
I remember this, going down
a pathway, went over a bridge,
over a stream.

822
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:13,738
Up another pathway and into
the shop and then Mum said,

823
00:44:13,781 --> 00:44:17,219
"We'll have some butter, eggs,
flour, sugar.
We're gonna make a cake.

824
00:44:17,263 --> 00:44:20,396
"We're gonna make
a bouncy castle for hamsters."

825
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:23,051
So, uh, yes...

826
00:44:23,095 --> 00:44:26,228
So, running marathons, I'll tell
you how the first ten go.

827
00:44:26,272 --> 00:44:31,407
This is how... If you ever want
to run ten marathons in ten
days. Good laugh at the back.

828
00:44:33,061 --> 00:44:35,716
A lot of people are going,
"I'm not going to do that."

829
00:44:36,848 --> 00:44:39,241
Just in case there's a bear
chasing you,

830
00:44:39,285 --> 00:44:41,809
every day,

831
00:44:41,853 --> 00:44:45,378
regular time, "The bear
is back. Oh, my God,
better do another run."

832
00:44:45,421 --> 00:44:49,425
First marathon, I think everyone
here could run, walk, stagger
a marathon.

833
00:44:49,469 --> 00:44:52,124
I think you could do it, it's...

834
00:44:52,167 --> 00:44:56,128
Give yourself 20 hours,
it won't look pretty, but you
could get it done.

835
00:44:56,171 --> 00:44:58,870
The second and third marathons
you will get for free.

836
00:44:58,913 --> 00:45:01,089
Because the brain goes,
"Oh, this is a nightmare.

837
00:45:01,133 --> 00:45:03,091
"I'm still in bed."
And you're...

838
00:45:05,877 --> 00:45:08,531
The brain cannot catch up
with you.

839
00:45:08,575 --> 00:45:11,317
Now the fourth to the tenth
marathon are pretty evil,

840
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:14,189
and I do remember
the seventh marathon,

841
00:45:14,233 --> 00:45:17,540
I was running at literally
this speed.

842
00:45:17,584 --> 00:45:21,327
It was really just sort of
crab-walking along.

843
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:25,418
And I looked back, a family
had joined me and there was
a young girl with them.

844
00:45:25,461 --> 00:45:27,855
And she was about ten and I was

845
00:45:27,899 --> 00:45:29,770
sort of pretending to run.

846
00:45:29,814 --> 00:45:31,772
She was just walking along

847
00:45:33,818 --> 00:45:35,471
with a couple of dogs.

848
00:45:35,515 --> 00:45:39,780
And I noticed it and I thought,
"I'm not running very fast."

849
00:45:39,824 --> 00:45:43,262
But I got it done, I just kept
going and got it done.
That's what I did.

850
00:45:43,305 --> 00:45:45,830
And some of it was tough,
up and down, I remember

851
00:45:45,873 --> 00:45:47,962
in the city of Bath,
the south and west of England,

852
00:45:48,006 --> 00:45:50,312
it's very upsy-downsy.
Brassknocker Hill,
they have.

853
00:45:50,356 --> 00:45:52,140
It goes on and on and on.

854
00:45:52,184 --> 00:45:55,230
And I had gone up that
and gone down and gone up,

855
00:45:55,274 --> 00:45:56,797
I was staggering up the hill,
not even

856
00:45:56,841 --> 00:45:58,930
pretending to walk,
I was just staggering.

857
00:45:58,973 --> 00:46:01,410
And a guy came out of a house,
it was one of those

858
00:46:01,454 --> 00:46:03,848
wonderful houses
with a secret garden

859
00:46:03,891 --> 00:46:05,850
and a door in the garden
and he came out and, "Oh,

860
00:46:05,893 --> 00:46:07,547
I could see into it."
He was in his 60s.

861
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:09,897
And when people see me running,
or anyone running,

862
00:46:09,941 --> 00:46:12,857
I think they feel compelled
to say something

863
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,510
and it quite often
comes out wrong.

864
00:46:14,554 --> 00:46:16,861
He saw me and said,

865
00:46:16,904 --> 00:46:18,993
"I think you're supposed to be
running, aren't you?"

866
00:46:28,089 --> 00:46:30,178
I think you're supposed to be
dying, aren't you?

867
00:46:30,222 --> 00:46:32,137
I mean...

868
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:35,575
I... It just seems wrong.

869
00:46:35,618 --> 00:46:38,404
Usually they say, "Come on."
Fuck off!

870
00:46:39,361 --> 00:46:41,363
I've been running for... Forever.

871
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:43,888
And they won't believe you.
After about 18 marathons,

872
00:46:43,931 --> 00:46:46,542
it became surreal.
You get in and say,

873
00:46:46,586 --> 00:46:48,849
"Ah, can I have a cup of tea,
please?"

874
00:46:48,893 --> 00:46:51,330
"Where have you come from?"
"Oh, I've run from London.

875
00:46:51,373 --> 00:46:54,159
It's my 18th marathon." They go,
"All right, it's tea,
is it, then?"

876
00:46:54,202 --> 00:46:55,943
And they just...

877
00:46:55,987 --> 00:46:57,989
It's as if I said,
"I've just eaten a car.

878
00:46:59,468 --> 00:47:01,383
"I'm from Mars, can I have...

879
00:47:01,427 --> 00:47:03,864
"Can I have a cup of tea?"
They wouldn't believe you.

880
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:07,912
So, you get tired,
angry, pissed off.

881
00:47:07,955 --> 00:47:09,827
You go,
"This hill goes on forever."

882
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:12,394
But you're never scared,
you're never going,
"I could fall into a hedge

883
00:47:12,438 --> 00:47:15,136
and die of hedge disease."

884
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:16,877
But, um,

885
00:47:16,921 --> 00:47:19,140
but since then I've started
sea swimming...

886
00:47:19,184 --> 00:47:21,142
Now, sea swimming,
doing training for sea swimming,

887
00:47:21,186 --> 00:47:23,623
it's scary, it's um...

888
00:47:23,666 --> 00:47:26,408
On the beach it's fine,
isn't it? On the beach it's,
"Throw me the ball."

889
00:47:26,452 --> 00:47:28,933
"I'll throw you the ball."

890
00:47:30,499 --> 00:47:33,024
"I'm in the water up to
my knees. What am I like?"

891
00:47:36,984 --> 00:47:39,334
"Do you want an ice cream?
I'll get a Magnum and hold up
a bank

892
00:47:39,378 --> 00:47:41,467
"and we can have as many
ice creams as we want."

893
00:47:43,643 --> 00:47:45,384
But 50 meters into the sea,

894
00:47:45,427 --> 00:47:47,038
50 yards, 50 meters out there...

895
00:47:50,432 --> 00:47:52,260
That's all you're doing,
hour after hour.

896
00:47:52,304 --> 00:47:55,002
Face in the water,
out of the water, in the water,
out of the water.

897
00:47:55,046 --> 00:47:57,004
And every time you come out
of the water, you're taking
a breath.

898
00:47:57,048 --> 00:47:58,919
If you don't get the breath,
you die.

899
00:47:58,963 --> 00:48:01,269
So, it's a little bit stressful,
you see?

900
00:48:01,313 --> 00:48:04,316
And every time your face
comes out, you look
for the safety boats,

901
00:48:04,359 --> 00:48:06,927
if the safety boat is with you.
If you can't see it,
you're dead.

902
00:48:06,971 --> 00:48:10,409
See, 'cause they've gone off.
"We're going off to go
shopping or something."

903
00:48:11,671 --> 00:48:15,109
And the tensions are higher

904
00:48:15,153 --> 00:48:19,026
and the boat in the sea
would have a course
that it was going on.

905
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:22,943
And the current would move it,
so it would auto-correct,
sometimes it would go like,

906
00:48:22,987 --> 00:48:26,468
then it would move this way
and I'd be going...

907
00:48:26,512 --> 00:48:31,169
"It's going away.
Catch up with the boat.

908
00:48:31,212 --> 00:48:34,999
"It's coming back towards me.
Get away from the boat."

909
00:48:36,522 --> 00:48:38,741
It was worrying.

910
00:48:38,785 --> 00:48:42,180
And then there's jellyfish,
they sting you, they sting me,
they sting anyone.

911
00:48:42,223 --> 00:48:45,400
They are Nazis of the sea world.

912
00:48:45,444 --> 00:48:47,098
They have no moral compass,

913
00:48:47,141 --> 00:48:49,274
they have no
geographical compass,

914
00:48:49,317 --> 00:48:52,625
they really don't know
much about compasses.

915
00:48:52,668 --> 00:48:56,063
Then there's seagulls.
You may know that seagulls
follow boats out to the sea.

916
00:48:56,107 --> 00:48:59,110
Every day, we'd go out
for training and the seagulls
would follow out.

917
00:48:59,153 --> 00:49:03,592
And the seagulls, they follow
boats 'cause they usually
chuck rubbish over the side

918
00:49:03,636 --> 00:49:06,639
and then the seagulls go,
"Oh, rubbish."

919
00:49:06,682 --> 00:49:11,165
And then they fly down and they
swim around and eat it
with knife and fork.

920
00:49:11,209 --> 00:49:16,127
And then they go, "Ah, lovely <i>
mange</i> of rubbish."

921
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:19,043
But I think when they were
following us,

922
00:49:19,086 --> 00:49:22,002
I think they thought
I was rubbish.

923
00:49:22,046 --> 00:49:25,179
'Cause I was very slow-moving.
"Hey, he's nearly dead."

924
00:49:27,138 --> 00:49:29,401
And 'cause two of them,
three of them were flying

925
00:49:29,444 --> 00:49:32,404
and then after a while two
of them were flying and one
of them was swimming behind me.

926
00:49:32,447 --> 00:49:36,277
He was literally just
doing this, like a duck.

927
00:49:36,321 --> 00:49:39,063
And I looked round and saw him
at one point and he was going...

928
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:45,678
Kinda like someone
in a spy movie, he was...

929
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:54,382
Like he was looking in
a shop window.

930
00:49:59,344 --> 00:50:02,129
"Lovely weather."

931
00:50:02,173 --> 00:50:04,566
Then I start swimming again
and he goes...

932
00:50:06,177 --> 00:50:08,701
Waiting. God.
And then there's the vomit.

933
00:50:08,744 --> 00:50:11,791
I'm pretty good at vomit.
There's a song that goes,
"Trains and boats and planes."

934
00:50:11,834 --> 00:50:13,532
And I have thrown up
on all of those.

935
00:50:13,575 --> 00:50:16,448
But if you added to trains
and boats and planes,
old ladies,

936
00:50:16,491 --> 00:50:18,754
I have thrown up on those.
I have thrown up on an old lady.

937
00:50:18,798 --> 00:50:21,279
If your gran or your aunty

938
00:50:21,322 --> 00:50:23,585
was on the train to Penrith
in 1974

939
00:50:23,629 --> 00:50:26,110
and got thrown up on,
that was me.

940
00:50:26,153 --> 00:50:29,765
I don't remember this,
my brother assures me it's true.

941
00:50:29,809 --> 00:50:32,377
So, I think it was true and...

942
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:37,295
I have... The bones in my
inner ear don't know
what's going on.

943
00:50:37,338 --> 00:50:40,385
And I thought when
you're swimming, you're driving

944
00:50:40,428 --> 00:50:43,736
the vehicle, so you're gonna be
okay. But no,

945
00:50:43,779 --> 00:50:46,565
I still need to take
sea-sickness tablets,

946
00:50:46,608 --> 00:50:48,219
which I didn't even know about.

947
00:50:48,262 --> 00:50:51,091
And normally when you throw up,
you're planted, aren't you?

948
00:50:51,135 --> 00:50:55,139
You're kinda locked down there,
there's a sink, a toilet,
a basin, a hat.

949
00:50:55,182 --> 00:50:59,317
Or, once in the hospital A&E
I was given

950
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,842
a kidney dish, which is a thing
they put instruments in,
it's about that big.

951
00:51:02,885 --> 00:51:05,062
And I looked at them and I said,
"Really?

952
00:51:05,888 --> 00:51:08,630
"That's a launchpad.

953
00:51:08,674 --> 00:51:12,286
"I think the CIA use these
to throw up around corners."

954
00:51:17,465 --> 00:51:21,861
But I was doing this training
swim and swimming along
and I feel this...

955
00:51:21,904 --> 00:51:23,645
I'm gonna throw up,

956
00:51:23,689 --> 00:51:26,605
and I was in the sea,
treading water, and when
you throw up then,

957
00:51:26,648 --> 00:51:28,433
it's not good, 'cause you go...

958
00:51:35,744 --> 00:51:38,530
And I could feel fish around me
going, "Oh, my God.

959
00:51:41,446 --> 00:51:44,275
"Oh, he's British? Oh, I see.

960
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:45,928
"Oh, this is Brexit,

961
00:51:45,972 --> 00:51:47,495
"where you throw up
on your own head?

962
00:51:47,539 --> 00:51:49,410
"Ah, yes, I understand."

963
00:51:51,934 --> 00:51:54,372
So, yes, but now, I keep fit,

964
00:51:54,415 --> 00:51:56,461
that's what I do, I decided
match-fit for life.

965
00:51:56,504 --> 00:51:59,551
That's what we should all do.
I encourage you to do that,
you probably won't.

966
00:51:59,594 --> 00:52:03,685
But it's what the wildies
are doing.
Oh, those old wildies.

967
00:52:03,729 --> 00:52:05,339
And they do look pretty good,
don't they?

968
00:52:05,383 --> 00:52:07,950
Very few crap tigers,
as I mentioned.

969
00:52:07,994 --> 00:52:09,865
So, um, so I was training.

970
00:52:09,909 --> 00:52:11,780
I was doing a training thing.
I normally do

971
00:52:11,824 --> 00:52:14,566
fast, high-intensity
interval training.

972
00:52:14,609 --> 00:52:18,483
But sometimes I'll just drop
a few marathons.

973
00:52:18,526 --> 00:52:21,660
So, I was running
seven marathons in seven days
for seven brothers.

974
00:52:21,703 --> 00:52:25,577
And it was in Sussex, where I

975
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:27,405
hailed from for half of my life,

976
00:52:27,448 --> 00:52:31,322
and I was running down the A-22,
went past a big house
in the country.

977
00:52:31,365 --> 00:52:35,239
Big house with
walls and big driveway,
one of those big solid gates.

978
00:52:35,282 --> 00:52:38,242
As I went past the solid gates
of the driveway,

979
00:52:38,285 --> 00:52:40,548
there was a dog, obviously,
behind the gate.

980
00:52:40,592 --> 00:52:43,856
I couldn't see him.
The dog went...

981
00:52:43,899 --> 00:52:47,251
as dogs have done since
the dawn of time.

982
00:52:47,294 --> 00:52:51,255
And for the first time
I suddenly thought, "What is
this dog trying to say?"

983
00:52:51,298 --> 00:52:53,431
If I could inject
FOXP2 into him,

984
00:52:53,474 --> 00:52:56,260
what would he be trying to say?
And I assume a dog

985
00:52:56,303 --> 00:53:00,612
would be going,
"Thief, thief or a burglar.
Thief slash burglar.

986
00:53:00,655 --> 00:53:03,267
"Assassin, behind the gates.
They're here!

987
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:05,312
"Listen to me, I know what
I'm talking about. I'm a dog.

988
00:53:05,356 --> 00:53:08,446
"Hello.

989
00:53:08,489 --> 00:53:11,275
"You say that I am the dog
that cried woof, but...

990
00:53:11,318 --> 00:53:13,277
"Really.

991
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,322
"This is important. Now!"

992
00:53:15,366 --> 00:53:17,542
Dogs are so sure, aren't they?
They're so insistent.

993
00:53:18,978 --> 00:53:20,980
You've never heard
a hesitant dog, have you?

994
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:23,287
You've never heard
of an unsure dog,

995
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:25,289
going, "Woof?

996
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:29,380
"Is that a woof?

997
00:53:29,423 --> 00:53:31,251
"Are you an assassin?

998
00:53:32,339 --> 00:53:35,299
"Hello, are you an assassin?
I'm a dog, here.

999
00:53:35,342 --> 00:53:38,302
"And the owner of my house,
he employs me,

1000
00:53:38,345 --> 00:53:42,393
"sort of, to do a survey on
the people coming by
the front gate.

1001
00:53:43,872 --> 00:53:46,353
"Do you follow? Hello?
Are you still with me?

1002
00:53:46,397 --> 00:53:48,964
"And so if you're an assassin,
I must come and kill you

1003
00:53:49,008 --> 00:53:51,967
"by tearing out your throat
with my teeth.

1004
00:53:52,011 --> 00:53:54,448
"But if you're
a little old lady,
well, then, good luck to you.

1005
00:53:55,884 --> 00:53:57,799
"You see my dilemma.

1006
00:53:57,843 --> 00:53:59,888
"Are you still there?"

1007
00:53:59,932 --> 00:54:02,848
It doesn't seem that that's
the conversation dogs
are having. They're just go...

1008
00:54:02,891 --> 00:54:04,937
"Assassins!

1009
00:54:06,852 --> 00:54:10,899
"Motherfuck... Oh, God, why has
thou forsaken me?

1010
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:14,903
"Dad, come. Kill them,
kill them now.

1011
00:54:14,947 --> 00:54:16,601
"Kill them all.

1012
00:54:16,644 --> 00:54:18,385
"I'm a dog."

1013
00:54:18,429 --> 00:54:20,779
Seems like every dog has joined
a right-wing party.

1014
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:23,912
And based on very little information,

1015
00:54:23,956 --> 00:54:25,740
they seem to be absolutely sure.

1016
00:54:25,784 --> 00:54:27,786
"Assassins!

1017
00:54:28,917 --> 00:54:31,442
"Assassins!

1018
00:54:31,485 --> 00:54:36,664
"Assassins slash immigrants
are here!

1019
00:54:36,708 --> 00:54:39,885
"I am right because I am loud."

1020
00:54:39,928 --> 00:54:42,757
And then the owner comes out,
"What the hell is going on?"

1021
00:54:42,801 --> 00:54:44,629
"Assassins."

1022
00:54:44,672 --> 00:54:47,762
"Assassins, are you sure?"
"Of course I'm sure,
I'm a dog, motherfucker."

1023
00:54:49,677 --> 00:54:52,114
"Well, how many assassins?"
"Two." "Two?"
"Thousand."

1024
00:54:52,158 --> 00:54:54,378
"2,000?"

1025
00:54:54,421 --> 00:54:56,075
"Well, 1,527."

1026
00:54:56,118 --> 00:54:58,469
"And you're sure you saw them?"
"I saw them with my ears.

1027
00:55:00,471 --> 00:55:02,560
"It's a dog thing,
we're like bats."

1028
00:55:03,822 --> 00:55:05,432
"What?"

1029
00:55:05,476 --> 00:55:07,434
"Just get a gun. Shoot them!

1030
00:55:07,478 --> 00:55:11,569
"Shoot them all, take them now!"

1031
00:55:11,612 --> 00:55:13,397
"I haven't got a gun,
I'm British."

1032
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:18,489
"Well, go on a spaceship
to America very quickly
for story purposes..."

1033
00:55:18,532 --> 00:55:20,708
"The Americans won't give me
a gun, there will be
background checks."

1034
00:55:20,752 --> 00:55:22,493
"No, there won't.

1035
00:55:26,453 --> 00:55:28,847
"They give Exocet missiles
to three-year-olds."

1036
00:55:30,022 --> 00:55:31,719
"That is true."

1037
00:55:31,763 --> 00:55:33,808
So, off he goes to get a gun
and the dog continues.

1038
00:55:37,421 --> 00:55:41,381
And he will continue woofing
until something happens
or until anything happens.

1039
00:55:41,425 --> 00:55:42,948
Just something unusual.

1040
00:55:42,991 --> 00:55:45,472
A cat sneezing,
a dog back-firing.

1041
00:55:46,865 --> 00:55:48,649
A rabbit imploding,

1042
00:55:48,693 --> 00:55:51,652
a snail playing the banjo, anything.

1043
00:55:57,615 --> 00:55:59,660
"What?

1044
00:55:59,704 --> 00:56:01,401
"What was that?

1045
00:56:06,537 --> 00:56:09,148
"Where was I? Now, oh, yes,
woof woof woof, thank you.

1046
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:16,547
"Oh, no, what have I stood in?

1047
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:18,723
"Who would do that?

1048
00:56:18,766 --> 00:56:21,900
"Who would leave a steaming pile
of that there,

1049
00:56:21,943 --> 00:56:23,815
"just walk away,
no forwarding address?

1050
00:56:25,512 --> 00:56:26,992
"Who would do that?

1051
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:30,169
"I would do that.

1052
00:56:31,736 --> 00:56:33,607
"This is my own poo.

1053
00:56:34,565 --> 00:56:36,697
"The irony.

1054
00:56:36,741 --> 00:56:38,177
"The horror.

1055
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:40,484
"The irony. I have stood
in my own poo.

1056
00:56:40,527 --> 00:56:42,660
"I am hoisted
by my own poo-tard.

1057
00:56:44,575 --> 00:56:47,491
"Oh, God, what can I do?
I must get rid of this.

1058
00:56:47,534 --> 00:56:51,016
"Right, let's try
and get rid of this.

1059
00:56:51,059 --> 00:56:54,933
"Is this what Michael Jackson
did? Is this how he learned

1060
00:56:54,976 --> 00:56:58,719
"how to Moonwalk? By standing
in his own poo..."

1061
00:56:59,807 --> 00:57:02,027
And then the owner comes back.
"I got a gun."

1062
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:03,768
"You do what now?"

1063
00:57:03,811 --> 00:57:05,900
"I've got a gun for the
assassins." "Assassins?

1064
00:57:05,944 --> 00:57:09,121
"You have seen assassins?"
"No, you saw assassins.

1065
00:57:09,164 --> 00:57:11,863
"You said you saw 1,527."

1066
00:57:11,906 --> 00:57:15,214
"Uh... really? I said that?"

1067
00:57:15,257 --> 00:57:17,216
"You said you saw them
with your ears."

1068
00:57:17,259 --> 00:57:20,001
"That doesn't even make sense.

1069
00:57:20,045 --> 00:57:23,614
"I don't think this was me,
I think this was Kenny."

1070
00:57:23,657 --> 00:57:27,792
"Who is Kenny?"
"Kenny is a jellyfish, comes
around here when it rains.

1071
00:57:27,835 --> 00:57:30,055
"Yes, we found poo though.
Yeah, we found poo.

1072
00:57:30,098 --> 00:57:32,274
"It's assassin's poo.
Pretty sure
it's assassin's poo.

1073
00:57:32,318 --> 00:57:35,016
"Shoot the poo.

1074
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:36,975
"Shoot it, shoot the poo,
shoot it!

1075
00:57:37,018 --> 00:57:39,760
"Take the shot. Shoot it!

1076
00:57:39,804 --> 00:57:41,719
"Shoot the poo.
You can't handle the poo.

1077
00:57:41,762 --> 00:57:44,243
"Can you? Shoot it.

1078
00:57:44,286 --> 00:57:46,854
"You shot the poo.

1079
00:57:47,594 --> 00:57:49,683
"The poo is dead.

1080
00:57:49,727 --> 00:57:52,164
"Long live the poo."

1081
00:57:52,207 --> 00:57:55,254
Now everything I have said
as the character of the dog,

1082
00:57:55,297 --> 00:57:57,517
that is what is going on

1083
00:57:57,561 --> 00:57:59,606
in Donald Trump's mind.

1084
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:01,565
All the time.

1085
00:58:06,352 --> 00:58:10,269
I was talking about
the ancient gods.

1086
00:58:10,312 --> 00:58:13,272
They are just like the Marvel,
DC comic superheroes.

1087
00:58:13,315 --> 00:58:17,581
They are very similar in their
jealousy and aggression
and all that kind of stuff.

1088
00:58:17,624 --> 00:58:19,191
They're exactly the same except
for spandex.

1089
00:58:19,234 --> 00:58:22,934
More spandex in the modern ones.
Less spandex more loincloth-y

1090
00:58:22,977 --> 00:58:25,066
in the ancient ones.
But out of all of them,

1091
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:27,068
my analysis out of all of them,

1092
00:58:27,112 --> 00:58:30,594
Batman is the best because
he has psychological problems.

1093
00:58:30,637 --> 00:58:32,639
It's much more mature.
He's not from a planet, Bat,

1094
00:58:32,683 --> 00:58:35,642
he's not bitten by a bat,
he's got psychological problems,

1095
00:58:35,686 --> 00:58:38,602
which is a much more advanced
kind of idea.

1096
00:58:38,645 --> 00:58:40,299
So, his story was,
he was eight years old

1097
00:58:40,342 --> 00:58:44,172
and his parents died
and he inherited
the dukedom of Normandy.

1098
00:58:46,392 --> 00:58:48,133
In financial equivalence.

1099
00:58:48,176 --> 00:58:50,918
Just a lot of cash, right? His
parents died in a tragic thing,

1100
00:58:50,962 --> 00:58:53,660
they fell on spikes
and exploded. And...

1101
00:58:53,704 --> 00:58:56,968
But a few days after that,
he gets attacked
by a whole load of bats.

1102
00:58:57,011 --> 00:59:02,756
And little Bruce Wayne is going,
"God damn it, this is a bad week
for me."

1103
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:07,979
But then he keeps getting these
nightmares. Nightmares of bats.
"Too many bats, man."

1104
00:59:08,022 --> 00:59:12,200
And then when he's 18 years old,
he says, " I must fight these
bats in my belfry."

1105
00:59:12,244 --> 00:59:14,289
And he becomes...

1106
00:59:14,333 --> 00:59:16,117
Batman!

1107
00:59:16,161 --> 00:59:18,642
With a very deep voice.

1108
00:59:18,685 --> 00:59:22,123
But he's still Bruce Wayne,
he looks like Bruce Wayne,
so he has to adopt

1109
00:59:22,167 --> 00:59:25,126
a slightly higher cadence
in his voice, have you seen
the films?

1110
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:27,912
"Hello, I'm Bruce Wayne,
how are you?

1111
00:59:27,955 --> 00:59:31,002
"No, I am not Batman,
he has a deeper voice.

1112
00:59:31,045 --> 00:59:32,612
"We have a similar shape, but

1113
00:59:32,656 --> 00:59:35,659
"we use the same trainer,
I believe, that's why.

1114
00:59:35,702 --> 00:59:38,357
"Oh, I do like the Bee Gees.

1115
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:42,187
"Particularly their '70s work
where they started
to look more like owls."

1116
00:59:45,756 --> 00:59:49,237
So, as you know, Batman has
the power of a man,
the power of a bat.

1117
00:59:49,281 --> 00:59:52,632
And he wears the mask
of a bat. Disguised as a bat.

1118
00:59:52,676 --> 00:59:56,201
And he has a belt here
with all the travel stuff
you get at airports.

1119
00:59:56,244 --> 00:59:58,943
There's little sprays and little
creams and stuff.

1120
00:59:58,986 --> 01:00:00,771
And he's against bad people,
wherever they are.

1121
01:00:00,814 --> 01:00:02,773
"Are you bad people?
You've done many bad things."

1122
01:00:02,816 --> 01:00:06,080
"We have done bad things,
but that's what we do,
we're bad people."

1123
01:00:06,124 --> 01:00:09,344
"I am your worst nightmare,
for I am the Batman."

1124
01:00:09,388 --> 01:00:11,259
"It's the Batman,
run from the Batman."

1125
01:00:11,303 --> 01:00:13,305
But surely bats

Now, talking plus imagination,
equals us.

1193
01:03:28,282 --> 01:03:31,895
That's my analysis of
the distillation of humanity.

1194
01:03:31,938 --> 01:03:33,940
Talking without imagination
is just this.

1195

"Well, I went down the road

1198

That's talking
without imagination.

1199
01:03:42,601 --> 01:03:44,385
Imagination without talking
is more like...

1200
01:03:48,955 --> 01:03:51,044
But we have imagination.
We do, oh, we do.

1201
01:03:51,088 --> 01:03:52,872
We have written books
with our imagination.

1202
01:03:52,916 --> 01:03:56,615
Books from <i>Beowulf</i> up to a book
that was written recently.

1203
01:03:56,658 --> 01:03:58,965
And one of those books was <i>
Lord of the Rings.</i>

1204
01:03:59,009 --> 01:04:01,272
Written by J.R.R. Tolkien.

1205
01:04:01,315 --> 01:04:05,450
Who, as you know, was born
J.R.R.R.R.R.R. Tolkien.

1206
01:04:05,493 --> 01:04:08,279
In Bloemfontein, South Africa.

1207
01:04:08,322 --> 01:04:11,935
And he grew up there
in the 1800s,
in his first few years.

1208
01:04:11,978 --> 01:04:15,329
And he would say to his mother,
"Mother, are we South African?"
"We are South African."

1209
01:04:15,373 --> 01:04:17,201
"J.R.R. to the power of nine.

1210
01:04:17,244 --> 01:04:18,985
"We are indeed."

1211
01:04:21,422 --> 01:04:23,381
"Is this an Afrikaans accent?"

1212
01:04:23,424 --> 01:04:25,644
"It is indeed
an Afrikaans accent."

1213
01:04:25,687 --> 01:04:29,430
"So, are we racist?" "Well, we
are only as racist as any other
white person in the 1800s.

1214
01:04:29,474 --> 01:04:32,999
"'Cause most people are,
unfortunately, racist people."

1215
01:04:33,043 --> 01:04:35,045
"That is not so good, Mum."
"No, it's not."

1216
01:04:35,088 --> 01:04:37,090
"And will we get less racist
in South Africa?"

1217
01:04:37,134 --> 01:04:39,005
"Well, actually we'll get
more racist.

1218
01:04:39,049 --> 01:04:41,529
"In 1948,
we will start Apartheid.

1219
01:04:41,573 --> 01:04:44,141
"But then that will eventually
finish in 1994.

1220
01:04:44,184 --> 01:04:47,274
"Nelson Mandela will become
the first Black president
of South Africa.

1221
01:04:47,318 --> 01:04:50,321
"And he will encourage us to win
the Rugby World Cup.
We win it three times.

1222
01:04:50,364 --> 01:04:53,977
"And the third time, a Black
captain will raise the cup and
that will be a wonderful day."

1223
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:56,109
"Excellent news, Mum.
How do you know this?"

1224
01:04:56,153 --> 01:04:57,676
"A transvestite
told me about this.

1225
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,375
"He was from the future."

1226
01:05:01,419 --> 01:05:05,162
"Transvestite?"
"Well, transgender,
he changed the...

1227
01:05:05,205 --> 01:05:08,730
"The language changes
over the period of time."

1228
01:05:08,774 --> 01:05:11,342
"Mum, what has happened to Dad?"
"Oh, Dad has exploded

1229
01:05:11,385 --> 01:05:13,170
"and fallen on a spike.

1230
01:05:13,213 --> 01:05:16,042
"We must leave South Africa,
J.R.R. to the power of nine.

1231
01:05:16,086 --> 01:05:18,479
"We're gonna go to Birmingham,
in England."

1232
01:05:18,523 --> 01:05:20,960
"Why there?"
"It is the next logical
place to go.

1233
01:05:22,266 --> 01:05:25,269
"In the chess game of life."

1234
01:05:25,312 --> 01:05:28,141
So, as you may know, he moved
to Birmingham, he grew up there.

1235
01:05:28,185 --> 01:05:32,667
The Birmingham accent is much
more like that...

1236
01:05:32,711 --> 01:05:36,149
And so when he's about five
or six, he's got
a completely weird accent.

1237
01:05:36,193 --> 01:05:38,282
Kinda South African,
kinda Birmingham.

1238
01:05:38,325 --> 01:05:41,241
And he realizes he's got
far too many R's in his name.

1239
01:05:41,285 --> 01:05:44,723
And he turns to his mother,
in his new Birmingham,
South African twang,

1240
01:05:44,766 --> 01:05:47,334
and he says to her, "Mother!

1241
01:05:49,336 --> 01:05:50,642
"Oh."

1242
01:06:00,434 --> 01:06:04,221
His mother replied,
"What the hell did you
just say to me?

1243
01:06:04,264 --> 01:06:07,093
"No one understands that,
that doesn't make any sense.

1244
01:06:07,137 --> 01:06:09,008
"Have another
go at that, J.R.R."

1245
01:06:17,234 --> 01:06:19,323
"No, that was a bit worse,
if anything.

1246
01:06:21,368 --> 01:06:24,067
"I'll tell you what,
J.R.R. to the power of nine.

1247
01:06:24,110 --> 01:06:27,026
"Why don't you write it all down
in a big book and never
talk again?"

1248
01:06:29,289 --> 01:06:31,509
And that's how <i>
Lord of the Rings</i>
was born.

1249
01:06:36,601 --> 01:06:39,647
In that book, he put in

1250
01:06:39,691 --> 01:06:43,129
two bad guys. No one has ever
done two bad guys before.
But he put in two bad guys.

1251
01:06:43,173 --> 01:06:46,350
One was called Sauron,
the other was called Saruman.

1252
01:06:46,393 --> 01:06:49,309
And if you're a dyslexic kid,

1253
01:06:49,353 --> 01:06:51,703
that's the same guy.

1254
01:06:51,746 --> 01:06:54,749
I could not follow
what was going on.

1255
01:06:54,793 --> 01:06:58,579
Would it have been so hard
to have had Sauron and Jeff?

1256
01:07:00,842 --> 01:07:02,801
"I am the wizard Jeff.

1257
01:07:02,844 --> 01:07:05,064
"Not Sauron at all."

1258
01:07:05,108 --> 01:07:07,284
That would've helped, but no,
he didn't do that.

1259
01:07:07,327 --> 01:07:09,808
Now ignore Sauron, if you don't
know the story, ignore Sauron.

1260
01:07:09,851 --> 01:07:11,549
He's an eyeball on a hill.

1261
01:07:12,463 --> 01:07:14,465
Got no arms, no legs,
no eyebrows.

1262
01:07:14,508 --> 01:07:16,467
Chuck a towel over him
and he's toast.

1263
01:07:18,208 --> 01:07:21,863
Now, in the story, if you follow
it, there's Jeff slash Saruman,

1264
01:07:21,907 --> 01:07:26,433
the bad wizard, and he fights
Gandalf, and they fight
with magic wands,

1265
01:07:26,477 --> 01:07:29,610
sticks and frying pans.

1266
01:07:29,654 --> 01:07:32,135
And it goes on for about
ten minutes.
It's quite a good fight.

1267
01:07:32,178 --> 01:07:34,311
And eventually,
Gandalf is overpowered

1268
01:07:34,354 --> 01:07:37,836
'cause Saruman does this trick
of saying, "Is that a budgie
over there?"

1269
01:07:37,879 --> 01:07:40,708
And he knees him in the bollocks

1270
01:07:40,752 --> 01:07:43,450
and Gandalf goes,
"Fucking hell, eh?"

1271
01:07:43,494 --> 01:07:46,149
Because Gandalf grew up
in Liverpool.

1272
01:07:48,629 --> 01:07:52,329
So, then Gandalf's imprisoned
on the top of
the Tower of Isengard,

1273
01:07:52,372 --> 01:07:54,679
which is eight kilometers high,
five miles high.

1274
01:07:54,722 --> 01:07:58,552
And he's up there going,
"I'm imprisoned five miles...
eight kilometers high.

1275
01:07:58,596 --> 01:08:00,728
"Oh...

1276
01:08:00,772 --> 01:08:05,168
"Oh, now I know the difference
between the metric and imperial
system of measurement.

1277
01:08:05,211 --> 01:08:09,172
"And maybe I will use this
five over eight algorithm

1278
01:08:09,215 --> 01:08:12,131
"while I'm running marathons,
maybe to change

1279
01:08:12,175 --> 01:08:14,177
"the distances

1280
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:15,700
"just as a mind exercise."

1281
01:08:17,702 --> 01:08:19,530
I don't... Anyway, so,
Gandalf is up there

1282
01:08:19,573 --> 01:08:21,880
and the weather is atrocious,
if you've seen the film.

1283
01:08:21,923 --> 01:08:24,665
Stormy and crazy and then
a butterfly comes by.

1284
01:08:24,709 --> 01:08:27,668
What on earth a butterfly is
doing eight kilometers up?

1285
01:08:27,712 --> 01:08:30,454
"I am completely lost,
I dunno where...

1286
01:08:30,497 --> 01:08:33,196
"I haven't seen a flower
for ages, I don't know...

1287
01:08:33,239 --> 01:08:35,676
"Oh, look, there's a bloke
in a dress. I'll go and have
a chat with him."

1288
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:37,722
Gandalf grabs the butterfly,
"Hey, hey."

1289
01:08:37,765 --> 01:08:40,333
And because people can hear,
bad people are around.

1290
01:08:40,377 --> 01:08:42,901
Because bad people are
around, Gandalf
whispers to him, "Hey..."

1291
01:08:57,307 --> 01:08:59,178
"What?"

1292
01:09:03,878 --> 01:09:07,230
"What did you not understand?"
"I didn't understand
any of that.

1293
01:09:07,273 --> 01:09:08,883
"You didn't seem to be
talking English."

1294
01:09:09,754 --> 01:09:11,886
"I was doing <i>sotto voce."</i>

1295
01:09:11,930 --> 01:09:14,498
"Oh. you're Italian?"
"No, it's, uh...

1296
01:09:14,541 --> 01:09:16,761
"Look, I'll tell you again.
There's two bad guys.

1297
01:09:16,804 --> 01:09:18,719
"One's called Sauron,
the other's called Saruman."

1298
01:09:18,763 --> 01:09:20,504
"This is the same guy?"
"Different guys."

1299
01:09:20,547 --> 01:09:22,810
"Their names...
Just call one of them Jeff."

1300
01:09:24,986 --> 01:09:26,597
"Look, you've got a mission.

1301
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:28,903
"I want you to go to
Misty Mountains, find an eagle,

1302
01:09:28,947 --> 01:09:30,688
"come back here
and I can escape."

1303
01:09:30,731 --> 01:09:32,864
"Okay, Misty Mountains, eagle,
come back, escape.

1304
01:09:32,907 --> 01:09:35,562
"Where are the Misty Mountains?"
"They're 800 kilometers..."

1305
01:09:35,606 --> 01:09:37,347
"500 miles?"
"Apparently so."

1306
01:09:39,958 --> 01:09:42,308
"Is there a car hire place
near here?" "What?"

1307
01:09:42,352 --> 01:09:45,877
"Well, how am I gonna get
800 kilometers?" "Oh, you fly."
"Oh, there's an airport?"

1308
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,357
"No."

1309
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,707
"Isengard airport?" "No.

1310
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:51,317
"No, use these things."

1311
01:09:51,361 --> 01:09:53,232
"Oh, these things?
These are beer mats.

1312
01:09:54,407 --> 01:09:56,279
"I'm an ant,
I was hand-gliding."

1313
01:10:03,808 --> 01:10:05,810
"Really?" "Ah...

1314
01:10:08,595 --> 01:10:10,467
"All right. Let's do it.

1315
01:10:10,510 --> 01:10:12,251
"Okay, I'll do this.
Will this be in the film?"

1316
01:10:12,295 --> 01:10:14,819
"Yeah, this bit
will be in the film."

1317
01:10:14,862 --> 01:10:19,693
"So, when I fly,
a butterfly, 800 kilometers,
that's worth filming, yeah?

1318
01:10:19,737 --> 01:10:22,479
"Finding an eagle,
telling an eagle, not being
eaten by an eagle,

1319
01:10:22,522 --> 01:10:24,263
"get the eagle to come back,
pick you up,

1320
01:10:24,307 --> 01:10:26,047
"that's worth filming, yeah?
Being in the film?"

1321
01:10:26,091 --> 01:10:27,571
"Yeah, it could be in the film."

1322
01:10:29,007 --> 01:10:31,314
"Bastard.

1323
01:10:31,357 --> 01:10:32,880
"I'm going anyway.
All right, here goes.

1324
01:10:32,924 --> 01:10:34,882
"Wait, what are you doing?"
"I listen to music.

1325
01:10:34,926 --> 01:10:37,320
"It's a <i>Baby Driver</i> thing,
I gotta...

1326
01:10:37,363 --> 01:10:40,323
"get there. Got a set list."

1327
01:11:05,391 --> 01:11:08,046
After four hours, Gandalf's
going, "I can still see you,
you know?"

1328
01:11:08,089 --> 01:11:10,353
"I'm a fucking butterfly."

1329
01:11:10,396 --> 01:11:13,007
They cut that out of the film.
I have no idea why.

1330
01:11:15,706 --> 01:11:18,448
I'm gonna leave you tonight
by telling Dad's last joke.

1331
01:11:18,491 --> 01:11:21,059
'Cause I came from a family
where there was no religion
at home.

1332
01:11:21,102 --> 01:11:24,410
We just had fun, we had fun,
we had seasons in the sun.

1333
01:11:24,454 --> 01:11:26,978
We used to muck about,
we used to throw mud balls
at passing cars,

1334
01:11:27,021 --> 01:11:28,849
we'd play around, I'd drink
a lot of lemonade

1335
01:11:28,893 --> 01:11:30,808
and eat cake mix
and go on adventures.

1336
01:11:30,851 --> 01:11:32,766
And then at Christmas, Mum would
say, "What do you want
for Christmas?"

1337
01:11:32,810 --> 01:11:34,899
to me and my brother Mark.
We'd write down

1338
01:11:34,942 --> 01:11:37,858
stuff on a piece of paper
and she'd put it in the fire.

1339
01:11:37,902 --> 01:11:39,599
And it would go up the fire,
which I thought was wonderful.

1340
01:11:39,643 --> 01:11:41,906
Dad was obviously on the roof
going, "I can't read this.

1341
01:11:41,949 --> 01:11:44,648
Hello?"

1342
01:11:44,691 --> 01:11:48,521
And so Christmas was like that
and summers were long,
hot summer days.

1343
01:11:48,565 --> 01:11:50,567
And playing in the fields
behind the house.

1344
01:11:50,610 --> 01:11:54,701
And then Mum would make a salad.
Salads were okay for kids.

1345
01:11:54,745 --> 01:11:57,008
But when you smothered it
with that yellow salad cream,

1346
01:11:57,051 --> 01:11:58,662
it tasted pretty good,

1347
01:11:58,705 --> 01:12:00,968
'cause that is apparently sugar

1348
01:12:01,012 --> 01:12:02,927
in a yellow paste.

1349
01:12:02,970 --> 01:12:04,885
But then Mum died,
far too long ago.

1350
01:12:04,929 --> 01:12:08,062
And Dad went on and he had
a good job, he got
a good pension.

1351
01:12:08,106 --> 01:12:10,848
And I said to Dad, "You created
a concrete runway here.

1352
01:12:10,891 --> 01:12:14,591
"And I'm gonna run down
that runway, I'm gonna take off.
I'm gonna take some chances.

1353
01:12:14,634 --> 01:12:16,810
"Because of you, you've given me
that confidence."

1354
01:12:16,854 --> 01:12:19,639
And he said to me, "You've
always had some crazy ideas.

1355
01:12:19,683 --> 01:12:23,513
"But the difference is now,
some of them have worked."

1356
01:12:23,556 --> 01:12:25,819
Which is kind of true.

1357
01:12:25,863 --> 01:12:27,430
So, here it is, Dad's last joke.

1358
01:12:27,473 --> 01:12:29,432
Dad liked hearing jokes
and retelling jokes.

1359
01:12:29,475 --> 01:12:30,824
And he would phone my brother

1360
01:12:30,868 --> 01:12:33,479
and tell him the jokes and laugh
at his own joke.

1361
01:12:33,523 --> 01:12:36,090
He never told me them, he always
told my brother. I think maybe

1362
01:12:36,134 --> 01:12:38,136
he might've thought I might've
marked him on them,

1363
01:12:38,179 --> 01:12:40,965
as a professional comedian.
"That's a good joke, Dad.

1364
01:12:41,008 --> 01:12:43,141
"But the end was a bit fuzzy,

1365
01:12:43,184 --> 01:12:45,143
"um, bit more pacing."

1366
01:12:45,186 --> 01:12:47,188
I dunno why, but I never
heard them.

1367
01:12:47,232 --> 01:12:51,062
But my brother heard them
and he read this joke out
at his funeral last year.

1368
01:12:51,105 --> 01:12:53,107
So, here's Dad's last joke.

1369
01:12:53,151 --> 01:12:55,022
A rabbit goes into
a butcher shop

1370
01:12:55,066 --> 01:12:57,024
and says, "Hello,
do you have any carrots?"

1371
01:12:57,068 --> 01:12:59,549
And the butcher goes, "No,
this is a butcher shop,
we don't have any carrots.

1372
01:12:59,592 --> 01:13:02,726
"We do meats here, that's what
butchers do. There's no carrots
here at all."

1373
01:13:02,769 --> 01:13:05,903
"No carrots at all?
Ah, I was misinformed."

1374
01:13:05,946 --> 01:13:07,600
So, the rabbit goes away.

1375
01:13:07,644 --> 01:13:11,169
Now, the next day, could be
a Tuesday, no one really knows.

1376
01:13:11,212 --> 01:13:15,086
The same rabbit goes to
the butcher, "Hello, do
you have any carrots?"

1377
01:13:15,129 --> 01:13:17,654
Butcher goes, "No this
is a butcher shop.

1378
01:13:17,697 --> 01:13:21,658
"Didn't I tell you this
yesterday? Aren't you the same
rabbit that came in yesterday?

1379
01:13:21,701 --> 01:13:25,792
"Look there's no carrots here.
You need a carrot shop.
Carrots R Us, Marks and Carrots.

1380
01:13:25,836 --> 01:13:29,579
"One of the carrot shops."
"Oh, I need to go? Ah, I see.

1381
01:13:29,622 --> 01:13:32,799
"I didn't quite understand
where... Ah, I will go there."

1382
01:13:32,843 --> 01:13:36,020
So, that was the end of day two.
Day three, same rabbit,
same butcher shop.

1383
01:13:36,063 --> 01:13:38,196
"Hi, there,
do you have any carrots?"

1384
01:13:38,239 --> 01:13:39,719
"No, we don't have
any bloody carrots!

1385
01:13:39,763 --> 01:13:42,592
"I dunno...
You keep coming in,
you keep asking this.

1386
01:13:42,635 --> 01:13:45,856
"You come again, I'm gonna
nail your ears to the wall."

1387
01:13:45,899 --> 01:13:48,075
"Ears to the wall?
That will not help me

1388
01:13:48,119 --> 01:13:50,774
"in my quest for carrots."

1389
01:13:50,817 --> 01:13:52,863
"Well, don't bloody
come in here, then."

1390
01:13:52,906 --> 01:13:54,778
So, the rabbit goes away.
Day four comes along.

1391
01:13:54,821 --> 01:13:56,910
Rabbit does not go
to the butcher shop.

1392
01:13:56,954 --> 01:13:59,086
Day five comes, rabbit does not
go to the butcher shop.

1393
01:13:59,957 --> 01:14:01,524
Sixth day comes along.

1394
01:14:01,567 --> 01:14:03,700
Rabbit goes to the butcher shop.

1395
01:14:03,743 --> 01:14:05,702
"Hi, there,
do you have any nails?"

1396
01:14:06,877 --> 01:14:10,489
"Do I have any nails? No,
I do not have any nails."

1397
01:14:11,142 --> 01:14:12,622
"Right.

1398
01:14:14,580 --> 01:14:16,974
"Do you have any carrots?"

1399
01:14:28,855 --> 01:14:31,205
I think we are so lucky
to have this.

1400
01:14:31,249 --> 01:14:33,556
We are here because we
are lucky enough to be here.

1401
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:35,601
What is the meaning of life?
There isn't one.

1402
01:14:35,645 --> 01:14:37,516
We have to put meaning into it.

1403
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:39,518
I think this century,
21st century,

1404
01:14:39,562 --> 01:14:41,825
is a coming-of-age century
for humanity.

1405
01:14:41,868 --> 01:14:43,827
We either are gonna wipe
ourselves off the planet,

1406
01:14:43,870 --> 01:14:46,612
or we're gonna make it a fair
world for 7.5 billion people.

1407
01:14:46,656 --> 01:14:49,136
It's up to us.
If we can do that,

1408
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:50,877
if we can make that happen,

1409
01:14:50,921 --> 01:14:53,532
it will be Wunderbar.

1410
01:16:01,992 --> 01:16:04,821
So, this has come
from my brother's attic.

1411
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:09,129
It's a historical game.

1412
01:16:09,173 --> 01:16:11,349
It's also got history to it.

1413
01:16:11,392 --> 01:16:13,177
I talk about it in the show.

1414
01:16:14,395 --> 01:16:16,702
It's called
Waddington's <i>Campaign.</i>

1415
01:16:16,746 --> 01:16:19,009
This is the very one.

1416
01:16:19,052 --> 01:16:21,620
My brother, my father and me
were playing.

1417
01:16:24,754 --> 01:16:27,147
My brother is so competitive
in board games.

1418
01:16:27,191 --> 01:16:30,803
His life is more tranquil,
but board games, any games...

1419
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:33,719
very competitive. Plays to win.

1420
01:16:33,763 --> 01:16:36,069
I'm amazed how well it's kept.

1421
01:16:36,113 --> 01:16:39,333
Be interesting to see if
there any marks of it
being thrown against a wall.

1422
01:16:40,204 --> 01:16:41,945
A bit battered up there.

1423
01:16:43,947 --> 01:16:46,819
Yeah, there's a thing that Dad
would say,

1424
01:16:46,863 --> 01:16:49,779
particularly in <i>Monopoly,</i>
'cause you get fines
in <i>Monopoly.</i>

1425
01:16:49,822 --> 01:16:53,739
He would get fines and
he'd say, "A mere bagatelle."

1426
01:16:53,783 --> 01:16:58,004
Which was just his saying or
a saying that was out there.
I'd never heard it before.

1427
01:16:58,048 --> 01:17:00,920
And I do remember when I was
running my marathons in the UK,

1428
01:17:00,964 --> 01:17:02,748
I had five marathons to go.

1429
01:17:02,792 --> 01:17:04,402
Already run 38,
only got five to go.

1430
01:17:04,445 --> 01:17:07,710
I just ad-libbed "a mere
bagatelle" to the cameras.

1431
01:17:07,753 --> 01:17:09,842
I thought, "Oh, my dad
used to say that."

1432
01:17:09,886 --> 01:17:12,976
And that's where it came from.
That came from Dad
playing board games.

1433
01:17:13,019 --> 01:17:16,022
Yeah, so now I'm gonna
put this away.

1434
01:17:16,066 --> 01:17:18,895
I don't think I can play <i>
Campaign</i> right this second.

1435
01:17:18,938 --> 01:17:21,811
So, yeah. So fuck off.
