3
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:43,794
The days are cold

4
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:47,214
Heavy mist that traps the snow

5
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:51,009
Just a metaphor of us

6
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:55,055
So many Christmases ago

7
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:59,434
We had our love so deep

8
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:03,772
Just like the joy the season brings

9
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:09,528
So let's fall in love again
This Christmastime

10
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:15,367
And every Christmas I'll be there

11
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,580
This time of year, we're both aware

12
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:23,125
We gotta fall in love again

13
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:27,004
At Christmastime

14
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:31,341
And all the angels in the sky

15
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:35,554
Shine down on us as we roll by

16
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:42,477
We gotta fall in love again
At Christmastime

17
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:47,608
In the candle's glow

18
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:51,486
I'm awake but no one knows

19
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:57,117
Just waiting patiently to hear
The sleigh bells jingle

20
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:58,702
There they go

21
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:05,042
And while the Northern Star
Lights the way

22
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,753
I dream of us

23
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:11,006
So let's fall in love again

24
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:14,968
This Christmas night

25
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:19,598
And every Christmas I'll be there

26
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:23,477
This time of year, we're both aware

27
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,022
We gotta fall in love again

28
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:31,026
At Christmastime

29
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:35,405
And all the angels in the sky

30
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:39,618
Shine down on us as we roll by

31
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:43,247
We gotta fall in love again

32
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,416
At Christmastime

33
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:52,756
Fall in love
Fall in love with the feeling

34
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,508
Fall in love, fall in love

35
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:59,096
Trust, believe
We can fall in love again

36
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,974
-At Christmastime
-Time

37
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:04,935
Help me sing it again

38
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,856
Fall in love, fall in love
'Tis the season

39
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:11,775
Don't forget there's a reason

40
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:15,487
We gotta fall in love again

41
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:18,323
At Christmastime

42
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:20,784
Oh, baby, we gotta fall

43
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:23,370
Christmas I'll be there

44
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,913
This time of year

45
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:27,249
We're both aware

46
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:31,128
Boy, we gotta fall in love again

47
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,882
At Christmastime

48
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:39,219
And all the angels in the sky

49
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:43,557
Shine down on us as we roll by

50
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,144
We gotta fall in love again

51
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,314
This Christmastime

52
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:54,026
-And oh, baby, we gotta fall
-We gotta fall

53
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:59,907
In love at Christmastime

54
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,166
Let's go.

55
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,752
-I say we pray
-Pray

56
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:12,669
Come on.

57
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,671
Pray that we will find

58
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,714
-We will find
-Pray that you find.

59
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,635
-Love for all mankind
-All mankind

60
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:23,430
-All mankind
-This Christmastime

61
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:27,017
-What the world really needs.
-We all need grace

62
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,393
We all need

63
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:32,814
-To heal our troubled mind
-Grace

64
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:35,776
-It's not that hard to find
-Not that

65
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,110
This Christmas.

66
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,904
-Not that hard to find
-This Christmastime

67
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:42,950
-This Christmastime
-Everyone together we pray

68
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:46,745
-Come on.
-Pray that we will find

69
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,288
Unconditional love.

70
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:51,083
Love for all mankind

71
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,751
We need it right now, y'all!

72
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:55,587
This Christmastime

73
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:56,755
We

74
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,632
We all need

75
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,634
Grace upon grace upon grace

76
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,470
To heal our troubled mind

77
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:08,100
It's not that hard to find

78
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:11,353
It is Christmastime

79
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,690
Listen. More than ever before,

80
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,234
-love needs to be something we doâ€¦
-Time

81
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,360
â€¦not something we say.

82
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,154
-Time
-This holiday season,

83
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,364
let's give love away.

84
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,950
Christmas

85
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,162
Wow.

86
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:32,875
And now, walking offstage
after an incredible performance

87
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,085
of a brand-new single
for the holiday season,

88
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:40,257
"Fall In Love At Christmas,"
it is the global icon.

89
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,925
At home, she's a loving mother.

90
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:45,220
To the rest of us, she's
one of the world's greatest artists.

91
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:48,682
But this time every year,
she wears a different crown

92
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,852
as the undisputed Queen of Christmas.

93
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:54,563
It ain't official until she calls it.

94
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:56,857
So tonight, on Apple TV+,

95
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,485
we celebrate the season with the one,
the only

96
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:02,738
-Mariah Carey.
-Hey.

97
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,698
-Here we are again.
-Here we are.

98
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,409
-Merry Christmas. Merry magical Christmas.
-Merry magical Christmas, yes.

99
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,619
-Happy Holidays.
-Happy Holidays.

100
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,621
This is a wonderful queendom
you've created once again.

101
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:14,625
And here we are, just surrounded
by music and by creativity.

102
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,377
I kinda wanna remind both of us
where we were a year ago.

103
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:24,343
Well, I mean, it was really tough
trying to put everything together

104
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:27,262
for the Christmas special last year.

105
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:29,264
You put so much heart and soul into that.

106
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:31,308
Did you watch it last Christmas?
Watch it with the family?

107
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,519
Of course, we watched it. It was fun.

108
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:36,730
I mean, the kids were there.
It was a whole moment.

109
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,650
Even my dogs were there.
This year, we couldn't bring the dogs.

110
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,360
I don't know.
There was some drama with the permit

111
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,237
-or some nonsense.
-Right.

112
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,324
-The dogs liked me. I met the dogs.
-They love you.

113
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,534
Yeah. They like--

114
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:50,369
Zane, you couldn't pull through
for the dogs?

115
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,454
I tried. They wouldn't let 'em on set.
I wanted the dogs here.

116
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:54,206
Mutley is so mad.

117
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:55,499
He's not happy.

118
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,417
Cha Cha will never forgive you.

119
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:00,212
-They're so your dogs.
-They are.

120
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:01,672
So your dogs.

121
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,841
What are some of your fondest
memories of last year?

122
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:06,635
I ended up doing this project
called the Butterfly Lounge,

123
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:09,304
where I wrote this song,
"Fall In Love At Christmas,"

124
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:11,390
'cause my band was all based
out of Atlanta.

125
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:15,519
So we were there writing new songs,
and Kirk Franklin came in,

126
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,771
and he just kinda listened to it
and vibed with it

127
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:21,483
and took it home and did what he does,
which is his magic.

128
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:23,735
So, it's just a fun--
what I would call a love song.

129
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,404
-It's like a Christmas love song.
-Yeah.

130
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:26,864
-It reaches people.
-It's about this time.

131
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,991
I feel like it's about
what we're going through.

132
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,577
That lyric at the end
that Kirk says, you know,

133
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,037
"More than ever before,
love is to be something

134
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:35,539
-we do, not something we say."
-We say.

135
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,166
"This holiday let's give love away."
That's a beautiful sentiment.

136
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,210
It gave me chills when I first heard it.

137
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:44,298
And I was just so excited that we have
this moment to perform it together.

138
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,426
The single is out. You know,
sometimes these collaborations happen

139
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,344
and they're cool for the moment,

140
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:51,013
but sometimes they're meant to be,

141
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:53,432
and I really love the journey
the song takes you on

142
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:56,852
from love song to spirituality and world.

143
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,562
How was performing it tonight?

144
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,397
-Like, the band is incredible.
-Yeah.

145
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,193
I, personally, like-- The blessing
that I take from this moment

146
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:08,864
is that I was able to get back
to the singer-songwriter of it all,

147
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,283
rather than, like,
schlepping around the world.

148
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:14,328
-No offense to schlepping. But--
-You've schlepped.

149
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:17,289
And we'll schlep again, maybe,
in a fun way.

150
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:18,957
But no. This is--

151
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,168
So many Easter eggs in this conversation.

152
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,879
This is the best Mariah Carey
interview ever.

153
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,298
Within ten seconds you were like,
"I'm making new music."

154
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,717
Within five minutes,
"I may do some schlepping."

155
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,928
-This is the best.
-They know what I mean.

156
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:34,014
It's never schlepping when the fans
are there. That's the goal.

157
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:35,307
-One hundred percent.
-Know what I mean?

158
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,142
But it's been cool to sit back and go,

159
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:38,727
-"I wanna write something new."
-To create.

160
00:08:38,808 --> 00:08:42,356
To create, to produce, to write, to do
all the things that I really love doing.

161
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,942
-Yeah.
-And with such amazing musicians.

162
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,985
I gotta ask you how the book
has influenced that.

163
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:49,363
Because when we spoke last year,
we talked about space, remember?

164
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:50,864
-Yeah.
-We talked about freeing up

165
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:53,033
a lot of the energy you hold on to.

166
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:56,078
To me, that would influence the music.
Influence the art.

167
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:57,162
-Yes.
-And has it?

168
00:08:57,246 --> 00:09:01,208
I believe so, yeah. The goal is
to emancipate that little girl.

169
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,795
Little Mariah. My little-girl self.

170
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,840
And so, I think a lot of that
really did happen.

171
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:10,342
A lot of healing happened during that.

172
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:13,470
And it's been really cool because
we've been filming the whole time,

173
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:16,640
so it's like-- it's so not
this moment of glamour.

174
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:19,726
It's behind the scenes, writing, whatever.

175
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,687
Mutley and Cha Cha are there.
The kids make--

176
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,021
Sweatpants. Hoodies.

177
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:25,107
-You think I'm lying?
-I think you're telling the truth.

178
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,985
I don't know if I'm in sweatpants
and hoodies, but definitely pj's.

179
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,778
-That's been my COVID attire.
-All right.

180
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:32,614
I think this is the first time I've put
anything that clings on for 18 months.

181
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:34,491
-I was planning--
-I'm not used to the shoes anymore.

182
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:37,160
-Seriously, what are we doing here?
-I'm here to bring joy to the world.

183
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:38,871
And you do that.

184
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,873
One of the great moments

185
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:42,916
in the Mariah Carey
Magical Christmas Special

186
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,502
is this anthem,
"All I Want For Christmas Is You,"

187
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:47,129
and the performance that you did.

188
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:49,173
What was your goal
with that timeless song?

189
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:52,259
What did you want to
really bring out of it for the special?

190
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:55,596
Well, I feel like because we were all
just going through so much.

191
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,015
And I just wanted that song
to uplift people.

192
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,100
I really felt like
I was on a mission, like,

193
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:03,145
I can't not celebrate Christmas
with the world.

194
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:04,479
And guess what?

195
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:08,942
This year, "All I Want For Christmas
Is You" is now certified Diamond.

196
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:13,864
I don't know, the song itself matters
to me on a level that goes beyond, like,

197
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,450
the sales and all those other things.

198
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:19,953
Because I've grown to love it more.
I've grown to be able to be like,

199
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:22,831
"Okay, you know, I'm listening to it
for the love of the song."

200
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:24,583
-Yeah.
-I used to sit there and listen to it

201
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,211
when I first wrote it and recorded it
and pick it apart.

202
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:30,422
And go, "Ugh. Why did I keep that?
Why did I do this?" You know,

203
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:31,507
-I do thatâ€¦
-Of course.

204
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,176
â€¦but it's become a thing
where I think I appreciate it

205
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:37,262
in the same way that people
who aren't meâ€¦

206
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:39,640
-Yeah.
-â€¦who like the song appreciate it.

207
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:43,769
How do you get yourself into a space
in the studio

208
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:46,980
where you're able to listen to these songs
that have been sung for generations

209
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:49,525
and do it in a way
that feels really authentic to you?

210
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:51,652
I have to have decorations.

211
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:55,322
So I had this room fully decorated
downstairs in the house.

212
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,573
Then, I don't know,

213
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:59,743
whoever was doing the tree, they were
totally bleak and took the tree down.

214
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,620
I was like, "Really?
They're gonna take my tree down?"

215
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:04,122
-Who takes a tree down?
-Some scrooge. Whatever.

216
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:06,583
And I was like,
"Now they want me to finish the song.

217
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:10,003
-How am I supposed to do it?" Luckily--
-Christmas is closed for business

218
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:11,505
-There you go.
-There you go.

219
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:12,589
You can start that one.

220
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:14,341
-I was just--
-But I had my blanket,

221
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:17,636
that's, my new Christmas merch, and I was
like, "Let me put that in there."

222
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,930
So I put it in the studio
and put it on my doggy

223
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:23,433
and my little plush toy and I was like,
"Okay, look, I guess I can look at that."

224
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,269
-These are beautiful, though.
-They are beautiful.

225
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,229
-Yeah. The whole vibe.
-I wanted to ask you whether

226
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,481
these meet your standard
of tree decoration.

227
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:32,401
-Absolutely. Yes.
-Right. 'Cause there are dos and don'ts.

228
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:35,779
Well, I would've had butterflies on it
if I had been able to come here

229
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:39,199
a day before with my art director's hat on
and just kinda tweak things.

230
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:40,659
-A little reverse engineering.
-Yeah.

231
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:43,287
I mean, I have no problem doing that.
But what can I do?

232
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,455
I can't put these thoughts
in people's minds.

233
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,708
You can come and take the tree away.

234
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,710
I have to ask a cheeky question
because, gosh darn it,

235
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,920
-you've dropped enough hints.
-Oh, no. Cheeky.

236
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:53,839
-You've dropped enough hints.
-Yes.

237
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:57,092
Are we hopeful we're gonna hear
something new

238
00:11:57,176 --> 00:11:59,052
from you sooner rather than later?

239
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:02,973
Are we hopeful?
I can't speak for anyone but me.

240
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,142
-I'm working. I'm in the studio, yeah.
-Right.

241
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:08,270
I have another project
that I'm very excited about.

242
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:12,274
I don't wanna say, 'cause then people
are like, "Who is it?" and whatever.

243
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:15,235
But already some people that are just--

244
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:17,029
It's been a lifelong dream to work with.

245
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:17,988
-Wow.
-So, yeah.

246
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:22,159
This incredible event
that you've created for the ages,

247
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,493
it's gonna be around forever.

248
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,704
One thing always really stood out to me,

249
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:30,042
which was that you got to share
a moment in there with your kids.

250
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,335
I know.

251
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:34,004
-How special was that?
-That was the best. No, it was the best.

252
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,673
Because forever,
we'll have that memory together.

253
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:37,966
-Yeah.
-You know?

254
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,886
But, by the way, they are here
and they're very patient.

255
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,680
-So, they wanted to come say hi to you.
-Hey!

256
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:45,933
-Roc and Roe!
-What's going on?

257
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:47,267
-Here's Miss Monroe.
-Hi.

258
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:48,977
-Nice to meet you.
-And RocStar.

259
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:50,103
Nice to meet you.

260
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:52,481
Look at the back.
But we have to discuss this.

261
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,733
-Look at this!
-Come on.

262
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,860
You guys with the merch game.
The hoodies.

263
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:58,654
Wow, the fit is awesome.

264
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:00,572
-You're on-brand. They're oversize.
-Yes. Yes.

265
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:03,158
-It's great to meet you. Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

266
00:13:03,242 --> 00:13:05,661
Your favorite time of year,
hands down, best time of year?

267
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:06,912
-Yes, yes, yes.
-Definitely.

268
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,705
-Yay!
-Halloween is, like, number two.

269
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:14,253
No, it-- Every year, I just have to say,
I enjoy it maybe more than them.

270
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:17,172
But I don't know. Do you guys have fun
every year or do I have more fun?

271
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:18,215
I think--

272
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,175
I think we all have
the same amount of fun.

273
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:23,637
Personally, I think I, like--
I love Christmas. It's my favorite.

274
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,347
-We all have fun.
-Yay! Come on.

275
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,349
-That is the best.
-Last year,

276
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:31,061
he woke us all up at 6:00 a.m.
to open presents.

277
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,355
-And I was still up from--
-Good man.

278
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,315
-Still working.
-I couldn't sleep. I was too excited.

279
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,192
-I don't blame you.
-Because I saw-- 'cause--

280
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:39,820
When I was trying to go to the kitchen,
I saw a bunch of presents and was like,

281
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:42,364
"Ooh! Ooh! I'm ready.
I'm ready. I'm ready."

282
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:45,200
I was like, "Guys, guys, I can't sleep."
And they're like, "Go to sleep."

283
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:46,910
Were you mad at your brother
for waking you up?

284
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,537
-No, I was like, "Thanks, bro."
-Let's go.

285
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,998
I love that you guys hung out with us.

286
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:52,666
-Thank you for helping us.
-Yes.

287
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,585
-Mariah, kids, great to see you.
-Thank you, Zane.

288
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:55,878
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas!

289
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:57,296
-Merry Christmas.
-Happy Holidays.

290
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:59,173
Happy Holidays.
Can I go off with these guys?

291
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:00,257
Yeah, please.

292
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,384
-You're kicking me out, right? We're done.
-Beat it.

293
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,136
-All right, yeah.
-Thank you, Zane.

294
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:05,220
-Thank you.
-Bye!

295
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:06,513
-Bye, guys.
-Bye!

296
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:11,560
Before we go, Mariah Carey has
something very special for us tonight.

297
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:14,605
She's returning to the stage to perform
a real fan favorite

298
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:18,609
for the holiday season,
"Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)."

299
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:19,943
Thank you so much for watching.

300
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:23,197
As always, it's so much fun spending
any time with the Queen of Christmas.

301
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,115
And you can too, simply by watching

302
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,703
Mariah Carey's Magical Christmas
Special right now on Apple TV+.

303
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,206
In our final performance of the evening,

304
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:35,042
once again, the one and only
Mariah Carey,

305
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,336
"Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)."

306
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:47,137
Oh, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah

307
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:49,223
Baby, baby

308
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:52,351
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

309
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:54,603
Christmas

310
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:57,397
-The snow's coming down
-Christmas

311
00:14:57,481 --> 00:14:59,983
I'm watching it fall

312
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:01,318
Christmas

313
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,695
Lots of people around

314
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:07,616
-Christmas
-Baby, please come home

315
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:11,411
-Christmas
-The church bells in town

316
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:15,165
-Christmas
-Are ringing in song

317
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:18,752
-Christmas
-Full of happy sounds

318
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:22,714
-Christmas
-Baby, please come home

319
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:26,552
They're singing "Deck the Halls"

320
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:30,305
But it's not like Christmas at all

321
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:34,142
'Cause I remember when you were here

322
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:37,813
And all the fun we had last year

323
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:39,106
Christmas

324
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:41,358
Pretty lights on the tree

325
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:45,112
-Christmas
-I'm watching them shine

326
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:49,283
-Christmas
-You should be here with me

327
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:53,370
-Christmas
-Baby, please come home

328
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:04,298
Baby, please
Baby, please

329
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:12,222
They're singing "Deck the Halls"

330
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:15,684
But it's not like Christmas at all

331
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:19,479
'Cause I remember when you were here

332
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:23,400
And all the fun we had last year

333
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,484
Christmas

334
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:26,737
If there was a way

335
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,741
-Christmas
-I'd hold back this tear

336
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:34,578
-Christmas
-But it's Christmas day

337
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:38,207
-Please
-Please

338
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,167
-Please, please
