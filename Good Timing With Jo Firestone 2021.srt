00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,760
- Oh, geeze.

5
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:12,053
- What's this one called?

6
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:13,596
- I lost my (indistinct).

7
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,766
- Ridiculous.

8
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,393
(group laughs)

9
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,603
- We're healthy, but
we're desperately unhappy.

10
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:21,521
- Right, okay.

11
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,067
- Orlando, are you
going to do it?

12
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,277
- I guess. Oh yeah.

13
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,741
- We must do our exercises.

14
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:34,117
- Oh shoot.

15
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,410
What's this called?

16
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,078
- Stretching the muscles.

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,414
- Stretching the
muscles, okay great.

18
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,127
Oh yeah, this is good,
really important.

19
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,385
- Now you have to sit
down again, sorry.

20
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:55,138
- Okay, sorry, Helen,
you got to go back down.

21
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,056
- I gotta sit down?

22
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,307
- Yes.
- I just got up.

23
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,145
- Could you just say your
name and how old you are?

24
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,439
Ziggy Susser 71.

25
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:08,943
- Barbara Bova

00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,945
- My name's Alix Elias.

27
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:11,863
- And Richard Marshall.

28
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,239
She tells, she says to me-

29
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:14,199
- Don't tell your age.

30
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,116
- Don't tell anybody.

31
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,326
Don't tell your age.

32
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:17,911

00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:20,038

My age? 71.

00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:23,500
- [Jo] 71.

36
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,669
- Oh?
- In the few months.

37
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,421
Like a kindergartner.

38
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,298
- You could say,
generally speaking.

39
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,257
- Yeah, generally speaking.

40
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,550
- Generally speaking, a hundred.

41
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:37,347
- My name is Evana Lewis
and I am 73 years old.

42
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:41,184
- My name is Teresa
Hommel and I'm 76.

43
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,560
- And you are, you're
wearing a mask.

44
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,062
- I'm wearing three masks.

45
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:48,900
- Hi, I'm Helen Yalof and
I am, ew, 86 years old.

46
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,112
- My name is Nicki Cochrane.

00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:54,906
My date of birth
is May 10th, 1938.

48
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:59,244
- My name is Bill Burke
and I'm 68 years old.

49
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,330
- Will you tell me your
name and if you want to,

50
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,540
you could tell me
how old you are.

51
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,418
(laughs)

52
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,462
- I'm Rebecca Dole, I'm 75.

53
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:12,841
- I'm Orlando Dole, not 75.

54
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:14,592
- Lynne Fetch, I will be 71.

55
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,511
And I'm still playing singles.

56
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,013
How do you like them apples?

57
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,015
- Oh, I'm Bibi Elvers.

58
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:23,143
And am I comfortable
saying my age?

59
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,811
Of course, I'm proud of it.

60
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:29,858
I'm 88 and a half
and going strong.

61
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,776
- So this is pretty much like

62
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,069
the comedy workshop
we do on Zoom

63
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,571
but it's going to be in person.

64
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,782
And we're gonna do some
exercises to get material going

65
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,994
and then we'll do a
show in four days.

66
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:42,871
No big deal.

67
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:45,874
We're going to do a quick
just a roundup of ideas

68
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,209
for what's the worst thing
to have on a T-shirt?

69
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:51,171
Bill.
- Cream cheese.

70
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,548
- I love me, not you.

71
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,010
- A naked baby on a
T-shirt trying to wee wee.

72
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:02,682
- What? A naked baby on
a T-shirt trying to shoot?

73
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:06,311
- Holding his little
wee-wee. (laughs)

74
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,063
- [Jo] Yeah, that's
a really bad T-shirt.

75
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,065
- I saw this T-shirt yesterday

76
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,608
Eat pussy, it's organic.

77
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:14,319
- I couldn't hear. What was it?

78
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:17,030
- Eat pussy, it's organic.

79
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:17,906
- Eat what?

80
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,449
- [Group] Pussy.

81
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:22,911
- Come on Barbara,
make her say it again.

82
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:23,787
(group laughs)

83
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,497
Everybody make her say it again.

84
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,749
- [Jo] Did you
have you done like

85
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,834
performing arts or anything?
- No.

86
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,170
- So, what got you to
sign up for the class?

87
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,880
- Oh, I saw that and
I said right away,

88
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,549
"I just, I would
love to do that".

89
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,093
- And you've
never done it before?

90
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:41,805
- No. In elementary school
I was always the one

91
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:46,768
who like laughed and
said funny things.

92
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,853
Got in trouble for
laughing all the time.

93
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,981
Once the teacher wrote
"giggles"

94
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,025
on my report card or whatever.

95
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,320
- So, what do you like
about the comedy class?

96
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:00,281
- I just like that
we're all together.

97
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,950
We all contribute.

98
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,451
It's just fantastic.

99
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:07,497
Sometimes I am so awed by
the answers that people give.

100
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,542
Really, they're fantastic.

101
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,877
I love those bar jokes, oh God.

102
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,046
- Who do you think would
play you in a movie?

103
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:20,051
- (laughs) Oh, you know
who just came into my mind?

104
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,262
I don't know if it was
because I thought of it

105
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,055
or I just got it, Sandra
Bullock.

106
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,893
She funny?

107
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,855
- So what does everybody
prefer if you had the choice

108
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:35,275
food jokes or sex jokes?

109
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,902
- Food, did you say food?
- Yeah.

110
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,029
- Food.
- Okay.

111
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:39,904
- Sex.
- [Jo] Okay.

112
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,115
- Food,
- Food.

113
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,242
- Sex.

114
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,201
- [Jo] Orlando,
you have not voted.

115
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,287
- No, I go for sex jokes.

116
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,456
- Barbara, you got one?

117
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,249
- I got one a quick one

118
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,959
and then I need help
with the second.

119
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:57,255
Two peanuts were in a
bar, one was a salted.

120
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,381
- One was a what?
- A salted.

121
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:01,134
- Two penises?
- Peanuts. Peanuts.

122
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:07,098
- So, the other one is that
if you get lox in the morning,

123
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,060
a pop will freeze you at night.

124
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:16,399
Soda pop lox bagel in the
morning freezer pop at night.

125
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,568
I told you it needs work.

126
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,362
- [Jo] (laughs) Okay.

127
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,405
Well. Anybody has
any anything to add

128
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,157
about bagels and
lox or freezer pops?

129
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:27,202
Oh well, I said, "I tried to
push it up, to get the lip

130
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,579
"but it went back down".

131
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:30,789
- Oh that is good.

132
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,791
That's how it's supposed to be.

133
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:33,792
- Whoa.

134
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,502
- The cook made a
cheeseburger.

135
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,295
I told him, "I
needed a hamburger."

136
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,506
And he said, "Do something
with the cheeseburger."

137
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:40,840
So, I threw it at him.

138
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:43,385
- Is that a glad to
see me in your pocket?

139
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:46,262
- Making sex on a
Sunday is a bad choice.

140
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,264
- Sex makes my hair curly.

141
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:51,518
- A good pastrami sandwich
is as good as an orgasm.

142
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,605
- I worked for a few jobs,

143
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:58,525
but my biggest, longest
job was a social security.

144
00:05:58,566 --> 00:05:59,943
I was a claims representative.

145
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:02,320
I interviewed people to
see if they qualified

146
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,656
for like an SSI program,
things like that.

147
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,866
And the best, the best
story I have from work is

148
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,411
that I interviewed a woman
who told me she worked

149
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,829
at a Whole Foods and I said,

150
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,664
"I used to go to the
one on Houston Street.

151
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,165
I loved their bread pudding."

152
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,752
And she said, "Oh my God, I
made their bread pudding".

153
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,421
35 years at work and that's
the most exciting thing

154
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,922
that ever happened to me.

155
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:23,633
Meeting a person who makes
bread pudding at a Whole Foods.

156
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:26,302
- Why did you decide to
take this comedy class?

157
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,346
- I've always been funny,
like my whole life kind of,

158
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,682
but you know, never
formally funny.

159
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,225
I would always crack people up,

160
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:35,353
make jokes with friends or
whatnot, but I never pursued it.

161
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,565
Like I thought of it, but
I was too scared, you know.

162
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:41,735
Like you really have to
give up a lot to pursue it,

163
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,653
to really make a career
of it and everything.

164
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:46,740
I used to have a dream to
end up on TV, you know,

165
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,324
like the big thing, you know,

166
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,159
to be on the "Tonight
Show"

167
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,785
blah, blah, blah.

168
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,329
Umm, now I know that
it'll never happen.

169
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,040
You know, it it
it's a fulfillment.

170
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:59,085
It's part of me that
I can tap into now.

171
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:02,130
And it's great that I have
that opportunity to do it.

172
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,131
- Alix, you got one?

173
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,341
Is it food or sex?

174
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,802
- Well, I was trying to do both,

175
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,930
but tomatoes having
sex equals ketchup.

176
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,182
[group Laughs]

177
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,641
- Let's see, Lynn, you got one?

178
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:17,312
- Is this okay from when
Mayor Lindsay was mayor?

179
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:18,813
That's when I heard it.

180
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:23,860
- I do have an encyclopedic
memory for jokes.

181
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,945
Something will trigger it off

182
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,573
and it's just in the
back in the Rolodex.

183
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,575
- So, do you know
what joke about a cat?

184
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,454
- The one about the little boy
goes to school and he's late.

185
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,998
So, the teacher says,
"Why are you late?"

186
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,833
He says, "I stopped
to look at a dead cat

187
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,669
by the side of the road".

188
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,004
She said, "Well, how'd,
you know, it was dead?".

189
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:45,548
He says, "I pissed in its
ear and it didn't move".

190
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,925
"You did what?"

191
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:50,053
"You know, I went psst
and it didn't move".

192
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,346
- Dinosaurs.

193
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:54,015
- Two dinosaurs were
on the edge of a cliff

194
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:58,395
and they see Noah's Ark sailing
away with all the animals.

195
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:01,106
So, one says to the other,
"Oh, is that today?".

196
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,693
- Can you tell me the
dirtiest joke, you've heard?

197
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:08,196
- The man goes to the doctor
for his annual physical.

198
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,448
And he says, "You know, you
have to stop masturbating".

199
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,700
He goes, "Why?".

200
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,910
He says, "Cause I'm
trying to examine you.".

201
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:16,162
(Jo Laughs)

202
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,045
- 30 wow.
- Wow.

203
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:27,298
- For other ways to
describe dog feces.

204
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,718
- Poodle noodles.

205
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,844
- [Jo] (laughs) Poodle noodles.

206
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,345
- Oh that's cute.

207
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:36,683
- Digestive ex-cremation.

208
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,560
- Pet extrusions?

209
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:39,686
- What to smell?

210
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:41,730
- Autumn color display.

211
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,648
- Think of something.

212
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,442
- Doggie gift?

213
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,818
- Doggie do do do.

214
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,194
- We met as children.

215
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:51,656
I was 12 and he was like 15.
- 35.

216
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,701
(all laugh)

217
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,286
- Our fathers were friends.

218
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,121
- Our fathers were friends
in college for God's sake.

219
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:58,830
- In college.

220
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,081
- Isn't that crazy?

221
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,291
- So, we both ended
up being actors.

222
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,001
And Richard found out
through his father.

223
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,461
- My father called me and said,

224
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:07,797
"Alix Elias is coming to
New York to be an actress".

225
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,925
- Anyway we ended up
briefly dating at the time.

226
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,594
Which was broken up
by my evil roommate.

227
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:13,595
I won't tell that story.

228
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,429
- Don't tell that story.

229
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:15,972
- Bad story.

230
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:19,601
So, then we didn't see each
other for about 25 or 30 years.

231
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,228
And then we ran into each
other at Jefferson Market.

232
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,521
- Jefferson Market.

233
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,231
- And then so, he
sneaked up behind me

234
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:28,401
in line and goosed
me and I was so mad.

235
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:29,235
- She wouldn't talk to me.

236
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,111
- What is goosing?

237
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,237
- Well, we were standing in line

238
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,031
and she wouldn't talk
to me I went plbh.

239
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,784
- And the next day we ran
into each other on 5th Avenue,

240
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,077
right near where I live.
- Right.

241
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,787
- And he burst into tears.

242
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,830
He was sobbing on 5th Avenue.

243
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:45,001
So, we have not been
separated since.

244
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,378
It was kind of like--

245
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,962
- And everyday I sob.

246
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,382
It's like, same thing, you know?

247
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,342
She likes it and I don't care.

248
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,302
- [Jo] Who here's single?

249
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,178
Single.

250
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,054
Who here's married?

251
00:09:57,681 --> 00:09:58,973
- We're married.

252
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,809
- I'm married but
I'm kind of single.

253
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,352
(Alix laughs).

254
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:04,104
- Anyone have observations

255
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,147
about being single
or being married?

256
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,065
What it's like?

257
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,274
Yeah what is being single like?

258
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,193
- It's you look at
these guys and you say,

259
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,946
"Do I want a Anthony
Hopkins type or do you want

260
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:17,409
a Harry Styles type?"

261
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,704
My father used to say,
"I've been happily married

262
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,790
for 30 years. 30
out of 50 ain't bad."

263
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:25,125
- Any other observations

264
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,502
about being married
or being single?

265
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,004
What it's like?

266
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,548
- Well, I was never any good
at dating or anything like that

267
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,590
so I just um you know.

268
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,217
(phone ringing)

269
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:35,802
- [Jo] I think we have
somebody's cell phone ringing.

270
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:37,262
- We have music here, coming?

271
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,138
- I hear that.

272
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:38,930
Is that me?

273
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,181
I think it's a hearing aid.

274
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:41,558
- [Jo] No, I think it's
a cell phone, maybe.

275
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,435
- Oh, I hear it now.

276
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,270
- [Jo] We have a popular crowd.

277
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,896
- Rebecca.

278
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:49,399
- Who would you say laughs
more between the two of you?

279
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:50,525
- I do.

280
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,569
(all laugh)

281
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,237
No sense of humor.

282
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,322
- That's what she's always
laughing at everything.

283
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,033
Becky, there's nothing
to laugh about, you know.

284
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,326
(Rebecca and Orlando laugh)

285
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,662
- Do you remember
your first date?

286
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:05,165
- No. She needed
someone to fix her...

287
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,417
Handyman to fix her-
- A loft bed.

288
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:08,626
- A loft bed.

289
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,171
- You know, eventually
he fixed it.

290
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,673
And he told me a joke
and it made me laugh.

291
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:16,634
And that's when I fell
in love with him.(laughs)

292
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,261
- Do you remember the joke?

293
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:21,056
- He said, you know, "Was
I still doing acting?"

294
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,349
And I said, "Yeah, sometimes."

295
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,519
And he said, "Well, you
know, I go to auditions,

296
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:29,272
"but you know, they say,
you know, you're too tall,

297
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,983
"you're too short, you're
too fat, you're too thin.

298
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,152
"But what they really
mean is you're too old."

299
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:34,861
(Jo laughs)

300
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,154
I started laughing.

301
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,533
We looked into each other's
eyes and that was it.

302
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,244
- I'm just going to say words.

303
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,872
And you just say whether
it's funny or not funny.

304
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,667
By itself, okay?

305
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,001
Ready?

306
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:52,087
Peanuts.

307
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,505
- [Group] Funny.
- And salt.

308
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,841
- Okay, how about treadmills?

309
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,468
- Not at all.

310
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,844
- Very serious.

311
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,221
- Gerbils?

312
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,139
- Definitely funny.
- Gerbils?

313
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:04,349
- [Jo] Gerbils are funny?

314
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:05,475
- With Richard Gere.

315
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:08,019
I'm sorry. I can't help it.

316
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,479
- How about band-aids?

317
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:11,481
- I loved them when I was a kid.

318
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:14,359
I used to put them on all
the time, I loved them.

319
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,111
Really did.

320
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,487
- And they were hilarious.

321
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,280
- Pumpkins?

322
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:21,574
- I don't think so.

323
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:22,659
- Pumpkin's are not funny?

324
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,327
- Neutral.
- Pumpkins are neutral.

325
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:25,120
- Neutral, yeah.

326
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,371
- Okay what about ghosts?

327
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:27,539
- Goats?
- Yes.

328
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,707
- Goats.
- Ghosts.

329
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:29,874
- Goats.
- Oh the greatest of all time.

330
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,668
No, no ghosts.

331
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,877
- Goats G-O-A-T-S?

332
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:33,795
- No ghosts.

333
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:34,838
- Goats are funny.

334
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,172
- Honey, have you seen my goat?

335
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:37,924
- Okay, how about milk.

336
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:39,175
Is milk funny?

337
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,470
- Milk is white.

338
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,181
- I think what we're
going to do right now is

339
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:46,850
now, that you have
your pen and paper,

340
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,977
you're gonna write down
three to five things

341
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:50,895
that you think about every day.

342
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,398
Tequila, do you have a list of
things you're thinking about?

343
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,899
- Do I get up now?

344
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:59,195
Then do I go to the
diet app on my phone?

345
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:01,489
And the only other
thing I can think of is

346
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:05,452
do I kill those roaches
with a sponge or my hand?

347
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,037
(group moans)

348
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:10,248
- So, you are, you are
still working as a reporter?

349
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,833
- Yep.
- And a photographer?

350
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,168
- Yeah, I am.

351
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,294
- It's important to
note that you are,

352
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:17,589
I would say somewhat
New York famous.

353
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,840
- No.
- [Jo] Yes.

354
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:19,841
- No.
- Yes.

355
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:21,676
- In a very small circle.

356
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,219
A very minute.

357
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:24,846
- My dog Walker said, "You
know, Tequila Minsky?"

358
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,014
- But she doesn't know me.

359
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:28,016
She just saw my byline.

360
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:29,559
- That's fame.

361
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:31,019
(Tequila laughs)

362
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:32,354
You're famous.

363
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,232
- Renown, but not quite famous.

364
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:38,026
- Do you have a
plan for the show?

365
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,695
- You know gripes.

366
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:41,571
You have gripes?

367
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:46,493
- Is my name Tequila Minsky?

368
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:52,874
Well, life is a performance,
but to be on this stage.

369
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,084
This is the stage?

370
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:57,212
I don't, the performing
doesn't bother me.

371
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,173
It's like the material,
having good material,

372
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:04,386
my own good material that's
what makes me extremely anxious.

373
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,262
- Barbara what are your
things you think about?

374
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:12,268
- I have walk Morgan, study,
monkey yo-yo on YouTube,

375
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,939
I love him and his
family. Eating food

376
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,024
and feeling only good.

377
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,818
- Okay, how about you Nicki?

378
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:25,031
- Every day I watch the
colossal failure of our world

379
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:30,161
become more and
more irreparable.

380
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,832
Every day, I wonder
why ignorance rather

381
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,377
than its opposite
is on the increase.

382
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:40,755
Every day, I lose
all hope for mankind.

383
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,298
- Wow.

384
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:46,594
Every day, I wonder when the
world, as we know it, will end.

385
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:47,929
- Thank you, Nicki.

386
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:48,972
Thank you.

387
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:49,806
(group laughs)

388
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:51,057
- Quite uplifting.

389
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:55,937
- That's great, thank you.

390
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:57,814
- I love comedy.

391
00:14:57,856 --> 00:14:59,315
It is a true gift.

392
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,985
I think it's like taking
medicine for your health.

393
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:03,361
- What's the end goal?

394
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,947
Do you want to make theater?

395
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:07,699
Do you want to make comedy?

396
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:09,159
- I just want to learn.

397
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,785
I thrive on edification.

398
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,163
I have to learn a hundred
new things every day.

399
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:16,124
- You had mentioned
that comedy is a gift.

400
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,001
- Oh, absolute a gift.

401
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:20,462
I know now, I know
it sounds strange

402
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,172
because I don't
believe in rel...

403
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,674
I would like to abolish all
religions from the world

404
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:26,426
and all gender from the...

405
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:29,846
I think gender is such
a terrible concept

406
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:31,598
and it creates so much harm.

407
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,434
And you know, I dunno
this human impulse

408
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:36,644
to put us in boxes all the time.

409
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:39,272
Now the Nazis were
famous for that.

410
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:43,068
By the way, I'm very, very
obsessed with the Holocaust.

411
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,195
You can't believe that
it actually happened.

412
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:46,613
You think that you're
going to wake up

413
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,698
from this nightmare
that it never happened.

414
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,533
Germany hasn't learned anything.

415
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:51,910
Do you know what they're
doing in Germany, now?

416
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,328
- Nicki, I just I
think the question -

417
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,954
- They're wiping out
the hundred year old

418
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:58,124
thousand year old villages
to make way for coal mines.

419
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,501
- It's awful.

420
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,753
But I think the question
was if comedy is a gift.

421
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,380
- Oh yes it is, yes.

422
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:09,094
But I would like to be funny,
but not in an artificial way.

423
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,220
You know, genuinely funny.

424
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:12,138
- I think that you
are genuinely funny.

425
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,390
- You do?
- [Jo] Yeah.

426
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:14,933
- Really?
- [Jo] Yes.

427
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,267
- You're the first person
who's ever told me that.

428
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,603
- Ziggy, what are
your five things?

429
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,647
- Well, I'm obsessed
with my bird.

430
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:23,525
So, where's the bird?

431
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,193
Look, I don't know where he is.

432
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:27,153
Does he have to poop?

433
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:29,030
Did he eat enough?

434
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:30,782
Does he want his head scratched?

435
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:33,618
You know, what's the bird doing?

436
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,620
- [Jo] How do you
get the bird to poop?

437
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,789
- Well, I can tell
when he's about to poop

438
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,374
cause he starts to back up.

439
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,918
So, I put my finger under his...

440
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,253
This is true.

441
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:44,337
I put my finger
under his stomach,

442
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:45,880
he goes on my finger

443
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,549
and I put him on the edge
of the little garbage pail.

444
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,842
And if he's facing
the right way,

445
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:50,385
the poop falls in
the garbage pail.

446
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:51,803
If he's not, it's outside.

447
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:53,013
But at least it's getting close.

448
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:54,514
- That's fantastic.

449
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:57,392
You have such contact with such
a closeness with your bird.

450
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:58,601
- Okay, Bibi, how bout you?

451
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:00,311
What are you things,
you think about?

452
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,605
- One of the things I think
about is what time is it?

453
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:07,152
"Where did I put" is a constant
thing, no matter what

454
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:10,655
because I'm a hoarder
in my apartment.

455
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,782
It's beyond upside down.

456
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:17,829
I have stuff going
back to report cards.

457
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:22,083
Hair that was removed
from my head during

458
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,294
some surgery 30 years ago.

459
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:25,795
But I still have the hair.

460
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:28,173
- When do you find yourself
looking for this stuff?

461
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:29,966
(Bibi laughs)

462
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:32,010
- So what do you think you're
going to do for the show?

463
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:34,471
- I thought I might bring

464
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:37,807
a very limited number
of actual items

465
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:39,184
that I was telling you about.

466
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:42,437
My husband's knee bone

467
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:46,024
when he had his total
knee replacement.

468
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,317
They're not supposed
to give it to you,

469
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:50,320
but he was, he was one
who would never let go.

470
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:51,321
He was lots of fun.

471
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:52,489
He should be in this class.

472
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:56,618
Well, he died two years ago.

473
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,870
But other than
that, he should be

474
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:01,247
in your comedy workshop.

475
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:02,582
- What makes you laugh?

476
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:04,084
- Oh, just about anything.

477
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:07,879
Because I love to see the
funny in things for myself.

478
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,005
- Do you just kind of...

479
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:12,008
You just see humor in every day?

480
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:15,845
- You know, you have to.

481
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:18,807
In some ways it's a
survival strategy.

482
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:23,770
If you can't find humor
in life, that's very sad.

483
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,856
And you have been just great.

484
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:31,861
And I envy your grandparents
to have somebody, I'm serious.

485
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:35,073
There's no decades between us,

486
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:36,408
even though there should be.

487
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:39,077
But the decades don't
exist when you're here.

488
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:42,706
And there's so many things
you don't know about me.

489
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,082
- Yeah?

490
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:50,755
- Spent many, many years
working, on site, digging

491
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:55,885
for dinosaur bones and--
It's very serious stuff.

492
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:57,971
- I understand, I
just did not hear...

493
00:18:58,013 --> 00:18:59,639
I didn't expect you to say that.

494
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:01,725
So what else, what else
do I not know about you?

495
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:03,768
- Mammoth bones too.

496
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,895
In South Dakota,
there is a huge place

497
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:08,857
with lots of mammoth bones.

498
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:11,192
- So, what we're going to
do is we're going to break

499
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:12,527
for lunch pretty soon.

500
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:13,987
But what I want you to do is,

501
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:16,740
so you have an assignment
for this afternoon.

502
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:21,786
You have to write a three to
four line poem that rhymes.

503
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,831
- On any subject?

504
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:26,249
- On any subject.

505
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:29,085
It can be maybe inspired by
what we talked about today.

506
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:30,378
If you want to do it all

507
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:34,966
about grapefruits or
intercourse or gerbils

508
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:37,510
but a three to four line poem.

509
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,306
- Gluten-free bagel,

510
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:42,766
anybody want half of
a gluten-free bagel?

511
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,601
- I'll take half if you
don't want it, thank you.

512
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:48,021
- And help yourself to
bagels or coffee or.

513
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:49,564
Oh, you want just an egg.

514
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:51,524
- A ham sandwich
walks into a bar

515
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:55,653
and the bartender says, "I'm
sorry, you can't come in here".

516
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,865
The sandwich says, "Why not?".

517
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:01,868
"Cause didn't you
see that sign on the door?

518
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:05,288
"We don't serve food".

519
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,956
(Jo laughs) Okay.

520
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:08,291
- Thank you, Teresa.

521
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,001
Thank you for
sharing that with me.

522
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:12,212
Beautiful.
- But I didn't make it up.

523
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:13,505
- It's okay.

524
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,632
- But I did laugh for
at least 20 minutes.

525
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:17,342
I'm very paranoid.
- I understand.

526
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:18,635
It's okay.

527
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:21,596
- And I tape them
because I don't want

528
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:23,348
any COVID sneaking in the side.

529
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:26,017
- Okay. Great.

530
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:29,145
And what, what inspired you
to take the comedy class?

531
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:30,897
- I'm ready to laugh.

532
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:35,527
- So, you weren't
ready to laugh until.

533
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,654
- Well, I have, I
was very serious.

534
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:40,490
You know, I was very
serious corporate trainer.

535
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:41,825
- Until when?

536
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:43,868
- Until the pandemic and
I didn't have any work.

537
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,328
- Really?

538
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,664
You were very serious
until the pandemic.

539
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:49,082
- Yeah.

540
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:52,502
And then I'm like, "Hey,
let's have more fun here".

541
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:54,587
- And then you signed
up for a comedy class?

542
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:56,589
- Immediately. Yes.

543
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:59,843
- And do you think that you
have a goal with comedy?

544
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:02,303
- You know, I think
people need to laugh more.

545
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:04,055
I think I need to laugh more.

546
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:06,391
I may be late, but
it's not too late.

547
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:09,060
- And this is
veggie cream cheese?

548
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:10,979
Oh, this is plain cream cheese.

549
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:12,856
- This is lactose
free cream cheese.

550
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:15,358
- You're more inspired
by Joan Rivers or...

551
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,651
- Yeah.
- Joan Rivers?

552
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:18,445
Yeah, because I used to
listen in the eighties

553
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:19,529
and channel her through me.

554
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:21,698
Like, I would think like her

555
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,242
and then I'd send jokes to
her because she had an album.

556
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:25,201
- You'd send jokes to her?

557
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:26,286
She said them on Johnny Carson.

558
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,078
I have a video.

559
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:29,748
Of her telling two of my jokes.
- Really?

560
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:32,000
- One bomb, she
said it three times.

561
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:35,712
- In the eighties, there was
a song by Olivia Newton John.

562
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:38,173
Let's get physical, physical.

563
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:41,593
So, she comes out and she
goes, "Today is income tax day.

564
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:44,721
"And my accountant is dancing
around the office singing,

565
00:21:44,763 --> 00:21:48,224
"Let's get fiscal
fiscal.", like fiscal year.

566
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:49,351
- Let's get fiscal.

567
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:50,268
Let's get fiscal fiscal.

568
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,145
And then she said it again.

569
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:53,938
- Let's get fiscal fiscal.

570
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,483
- And then she said
that the third time.

571
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,193
- Let's get fiscal fiscal.

572
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:02,155
- She was angry that they
weren't laughing loud enough.

573
00:22:02,197 --> 00:22:05,408
More than that, she was
just singing it three times.

574
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,701
I thought it was
gonna be a hot joke.

575
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:08,536
- And what did you
do before this?

576
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:10,538
- Well, I'm a retired teacher.

577
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,416
And now I dabble
in stand up comedy.

578
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,293
- And what is your
goal with comedy?

579
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:16,753
- You know what my goal is?
- What?

580
00:22:16,795 --> 00:22:20,423
- That I make people laugh.

581
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:24,052
What I want is just
to be so funny.

582
00:22:24,094 --> 00:22:27,138
- So, you've done comedy
like for a long time.

583
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,058
What do you think was one of
the greatest days of your life?

584
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:34,270
- Oh the day I got a pink
envelope from Joan Rivers.

585
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:35,438
That was a thrill.

586
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,773
- What did it say?

587
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:38,983
- These are the jokes
we're buying from you.

588
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:40,443
- How much did you
get paid per joke?

589
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:42,445
- Only $10, but
let me defend her.

590
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:44,030
Had to be brand new every day.

591
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:46,658
Should she give
everybody so much money

592
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,536
for five or 10 minutes
worth of material?

593
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:51,037
- How much money would
you pay for a joke?

594
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:54,165
- Hmm. I don't
know, Jo that's...

595
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:57,043
You're asking me really
provocative challenging ques...

596
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:59,713
Larry King, you
shouldn't know from this.

597
00:22:59,754 --> 00:23:02,007
You should really hear Jo.

598
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:03,383
These are, I don't know.

599
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:04,968
I don't know.

600
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:05,927
Rest in peace.

601
00:23:08,013 --> 00:23:11,599
How would you like to be
in this head, Jo? (laughs)

602
00:23:13,268 --> 00:23:16,438
- I've never eaten
yogurt with a fork before

603
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:17,605
but there's no spoon.

604
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:19,816
- Let me get you a spoon.

605
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:23,695
- Okay, so are we ready?

606
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:25,822
Evana, would you like
to share your poem?

607
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:26,906
- Sure.

608
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:28,908
- Standing in the dark shadow,

609
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,494
watching my reflection
on the wall.

610
00:23:31,536 --> 00:23:33,455
As I gazed on my shadow,

611
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:35,832
I thought, what a wonderful
sight.

612
00:23:35,874 --> 00:23:38,335
Maybe I imagined the reflection,

613
00:23:38,376 --> 00:23:41,338
but to my surprise,
I saw it again.

614
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:45,800
What a wonderful sight to see
as I step outside of my shade,

615
00:23:45,842 --> 00:23:48,261
I know it was great
to be in that spot,

616
00:23:48,303 --> 00:23:51,014
but to my acknowledgement,

617
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:53,725
it was reflection
of my own self.

618
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:56,019
- Wow.

619
00:23:56,061 --> 00:23:58,730
- Evana, where did
this come from?

620
00:24:00,565 --> 00:24:03,693
You wrote that in
like 30 seconds.

621
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:06,363
What did you do before
this, professionally?

622
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:07,697
- Okay, I work for the

623
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:11,534
New York City Human
Resource Administration.

624
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:13,286
- So, what do you do when
you're not in this class?

625
00:24:13,328 --> 00:24:16,748
- I take a maybe about three
or four classes a day on Zoom.

626
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,291
- Three or four?
- Everyday.

627
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:25,465
- I take exercise, Tai-Chi,
group session, yoga exercise.

628
00:24:25,507 --> 00:24:30,637
And then, in the evening I be
on prayer line with my church.

629
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:32,555
You know, I do ministry.

630
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:34,140
I preach.
- You do?

631
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:35,767
- Yes I do, I do preach.

632
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:37,977
So, sometimes I
maybe I'll sit down

633
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:40,230
and write a little sermon.

634
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:41,398
- Who makes you laugh?

635
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:42,565
- You know, depends on, it.

636
00:24:42,607 --> 00:24:44,943
Could be anybody depends
on what they say.

637
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:48,655
I love to laugh, you know
because laughing is very good
for you.

638
00:24:49,781 --> 00:24:52,033
- What, what is your
laugh sound like?

639
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:54,619
(Evana laughs)

640
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:59,582
- Oh a laugh that
make you feel so good?

641
00:24:59,624 --> 00:25:01,668
You know, it open up everything.

642
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,837
- And what would you say
is your outlook on life?

643
00:25:03,878 --> 00:25:07,590
- Well, my outlook is,
I'm enjoying my retirement

644
00:25:07,632 --> 00:25:08,800
and I love it.

645
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:11,094
I do what I want to do,

646
00:25:11,136 --> 00:25:12,512
get up when I want to get up,

647
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:15,724
wear what I want to wear and
I say what I want to say.

648
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:22,063
- Evana. I, I I'm sorry
that she went first.

649
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:25,442
I'm sorry, but yeah, you
really set the bar very high.

650
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:26,276
Okay. Bill.

651
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:29,404
- It gets easier
now for everyone.

652
00:25:30,488 --> 00:25:31,448
- Set the bar low.

653
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:32,782
- That bar was way up there,

654
00:25:32,824 --> 00:25:34,659
we gotta bring it
back down to earth.

655
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:36,119
- Thank you.

656
00:25:36,161 --> 00:25:38,913
- There was a whale who
never failed during a gale.

657
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:41,416
Wouldn't shut up
about the holy grail.

658
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:43,710
(group laughs)

659
00:25:43,752 --> 00:25:45,086
- Thank you, Bill.

660
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:47,630
What did you do
professionally before this?

661
00:25:47,672 --> 00:25:48,715
- Stagehand, I was a stagehand.

662
00:25:48,757 --> 00:25:50,216
Local One stagehand.

663
00:25:50,258 --> 00:25:51,926
- Did you do comedy
before this class?

664
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:52,969
- No.

665
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:54,220
- Did you ever want to?

666
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:58,141
- Sure.

667
00:25:58,183 --> 00:26:03,021
Yeah. It just never crossed
my mind as a possibility.

668
00:26:03,688 --> 00:26:05,231
And then you came along.

669
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:06,941
- And do you think like you
have the same sense of humor

670
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:08,651
as most of the
people in the class?

671
00:26:08,693 --> 00:26:11,029
- I don't think we have
the same sense of humor,

672
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:15,200
but different people in
the class do crack me up

673
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:16,117
and are hilarious.

674
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,205
Bibi is one who, who is so dry

675
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:23,792
and if you're not
paying attention, you're
liable to miss it.

676
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:25,710
But I think she's hilarious.

677
00:26:25,752 --> 00:26:27,504
- Does your wife
think you're funny?

678
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:29,089
- The question's kind of broad.

679
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,382
(Jo laughs)

680
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:31,466
- But is she coming to the show?

681
00:26:31,508 --> 00:26:32,676
- Yes.

682
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:33,760
- Are you nervous for the show?

683
00:26:33,802 --> 00:26:35,011
- I'm scared to death.

684
00:26:35,053 --> 00:26:36,680
- Really?
- Absolutely.

685
00:26:36,721 --> 00:26:38,181
- What are you scared of?

686
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:41,351
- Never having done this in
front of a live audience before.

687
00:26:41,393 --> 00:26:44,062
You're pretty vulnerable.

688
00:26:44,104 --> 00:26:48,274
And you know, just telling
the joke is one thing,

689
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:51,653
having them judge...

690
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:53,655
Now throw in the lions.

691
00:26:53,697 --> 00:26:55,907
Yeah, okay.

692
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:57,158
- Ziggy, you got one?

693
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,079
- As I trickle,
I hold my pickle.

694
00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:04,541
I was circumcised
with a sickle.

695
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:06,459
I hope you're not fickle.

696
00:27:06,501 --> 00:27:08,628
- Okay, thank you so much.

697
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:09,504
Okay, let's see.

698
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:10,797
Nicki, you have one?

699
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:15,760
- Ode to my best friend,
Esteemed iPhone 8,

700
00:27:17,262 --> 00:27:21,182
ever present and ready to
fulfill my limitless quest

701
00:27:22,017 --> 00:27:24,060
for unquenchable edification.

702
00:27:24,102 --> 00:27:28,064
All I can say in,
grateful appreciation, is

703
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:29,983
forever Merci Beaucoup.

704
00:27:31,943 --> 00:27:33,153
- And that was
about your iPhone?

705
00:27:33,194 --> 00:27:34,362
- Yes.

706
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:37,032
It's an ode to my
iPhone, my best friend.

707
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:38,616
- Can we see it one more time?

708
00:27:38,658 --> 00:27:41,077
- Oh, of course, I love it.

709
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:41,911
Richard.

710
00:27:41,953 --> 00:27:43,538
- The Lord is my shepherd.

711
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,497
(group laughs)

712
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:46,416
No, that's not right, I'm sorry.

713
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:49,502
Today is hot and sweaty.

714
00:27:49,544 --> 00:27:52,005
My girlfriend's name is Betty.

715
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:57,802
I'd like to get her clothes
off, so she'd be cool and ready.

716
00:27:57,844 --> 00:27:59,763
(group laughs)

717
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,187
So, you have some time,
cause the show's on Friday,

718
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:08,855
- Friday?
- Friday.

719
00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:10,982
You have to do a three
to four minute set.

720
00:28:11,024 --> 00:28:12,609
- That's a long time.

721
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,903
- Is that based on what
we said today or anything?

722
00:28:14,944 --> 00:28:16,071
- It could be anything.

723
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:17,989
You can all do something
for three minutes.

724
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:19,866
- Like I said, if you're
waiting for the laughs,

725
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:21,117
it'll be a little more.

726
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:22,327
- Lynne, might go
over a little bit,

727
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:24,454
but everyone else
might go under.

728
00:28:24,496 --> 00:28:25,955
And who knows?

729
00:28:25,997 --> 00:28:28,083
So, think about the stuff
that you came up with today.

730
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:29,459
And also maybe things
that you'd like to joke

731
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:32,003
about in class, so far
for the whole year.

732
00:28:32,045 --> 00:28:33,213
- Should it be cohesive?

733
00:28:33,254 --> 00:28:34,589
Or could it be things
strung together

734
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:35,882
or it should be...?

735
00:28:35,924 --> 00:28:39,219
- You know, you can
always use the, "anyway".

736
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:39,969
- Anyway.

737
00:28:40,011 --> 00:28:41,680
Okay.
- Yeah.

738
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:43,515
- Could I do a bar jokes?

739
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:44,641
Walked into a bar?

740
00:28:44,683 --> 00:28:46,476
- Yes, definitely.

741
00:28:46,518 --> 00:28:48,144
- What's the set up gonna be?

742
00:28:48,186 --> 00:28:49,646
- A stage.
- A real stage?

743
00:28:49,688 --> 00:28:51,773
- There's gonna be a microphone.

744
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:53,983
- Like this?
- Yeah.

745
00:28:54,025 --> 00:28:56,486
You guys are doing... this is
great.

746
00:28:56,528 --> 00:28:57,654
And you did a great class.

747
00:28:57,696 --> 00:28:58,780
So, give it up for yourself.

748
00:28:58,822 --> 00:29:01,574
(group applause)

749
00:29:02,951 --> 00:29:05,078
- I'm gonna bring up an
old show business joke.

750
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:09,457
A fellow was complaining
to his friend. He said,

751
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:12,877
"Oh, I have this terrible job,
terrible, terrible job".

752
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,171
"What is it?"

753
00:29:15,213 --> 00:29:17,590
"Well, I go behind the
elephants in a circus

754
00:29:17,632 --> 00:29:22,470
"when they go around the circus
ring and I sweep behind him.

755
00:29:22,512 --> 00:29:25,557
"And the dung falls all
over me, all over my face,

756
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:26,433
"all over my body.

757
00:29:26,474 --> 00:29:27,350
"It smells awful.

758
00:29:27,392 --> 00:29:28,560
"It smells terrible.

759
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:30,103
"And even when I go home
afterwards and shower,

760
00:29:30,145 --> 00:29:30,979
"it doesn't come off.

761
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:32,689
"It doesn't come off."

762
00:29:32,731 --> 00:29:33,690
So his friend says,
"Well, why don't

763
00:29:33,732 --> 00:29:35,608
"you just leave that job"?

764
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:39,487
He says, "What, and
leave show business?".

765
00:29:40,864 --> 00:29:43,324
When I used to do singing, I
worked comedy into my act

766
00:29:43,366 --> 00:29:45,952
and to my introductions
and so forth.

767
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:48,788
And usually I got good
at handling people,

768
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:49,748
that would...

769
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:51,541
What's the word?
- Heckle?

770
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:52,459
- Heckle you.

771
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,002
- Start singing.
- What?

772
00:29:54,044 --> 00:29:55,086
- I'm gonna heckle you.

773
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:56,254
You gotta shut me down.

774
00:29:56,296 --> 00:29:58,590
- Gotta sing and
heckle heckle okay.

775
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:02,260
*Toy balloon toy balloon*

776
00:30:02,302 --> 00:30:03,136
- You suck.

777
00:30:03,178 --> 00:30:06,681
*So, do you, my darling *

778
00:30:06,723 --> 00:30:11,436
* Why don't you come up and
sing with me, my toy balloon*

779
00:30:11,478 --> 00:30:12,437
- That was so great.

780
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:14,481
Thank you, Helen.
- Thank you.

781
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:17,192
- Wow, that was beautiful.

782
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:18,151
- Good enough? Good enough?

783
00:30:18,193 --> 00:30:20,111
Well, I wrote the song.

784
00:30:20,153 --> 00:30:21,571
- When did you write it

785
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:23,782
and are there other lyrics
besides toy balloon?

786
00:30:23,823 --> 00:30:26,368
- It was one of my
first songs I wrote.

787
00:30:26,409 --> 00:30:29,788
I did a play called
Aladdin Lived in Brooklyn.

788
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:31,414
And I stuck it in the play

789
00:30:31,456 --> 00:30:33,249
as the song with
the princess song.

790
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:34,501
- How's it go one more time?

791
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:35,335
What's the chorus?

792
00:30:35,377 --> 00:30:38,672
*Toy balloon toy balloon *

793
00:30:38,713 --> 00:30:42,967
*Oh, come back and take me too *

794
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:47,639
* With you I'd float
my toy balloon *

795
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:50,975
* Anywhere, but here *

796
00:30:55,647 --> 00:30:56,439
- [Jo] Come on down.

797
00:30:56,481 --> 00:30:57,107
Hi Elaine.

798
00:30:57,148 --> 00:30:57,982
- Here's the booze.

799
00:30:58,024 --> 00:30:58,858
I don't drink.

800
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,943
- Rebecca, come sit.

801
00:30:59,984 --> 00:31:00,777
- Who else would like one?

802
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:01,986
It's non alcoholic.

803
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:03,196
It's also warm.

804
00:31:03,238 --> 00:31:05,031
- L'Chaim, everybody.

805
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:08,118
- Break a leg everybody.

806
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,285
What was the thing
she said to you?

807
00:31:09,327 --> 00:31:11,037
"You got a pencil
in your pocket,

808
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:12,956
were you happy to see
me?" is that the one?

809
00:31:12,997 --> 00:31:15,000
- Welcome everybody
to the party bus.

810
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:17,752
(group applause)

811
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:21,423
We're gonna get pumped up.

812
00:31:21,464 --> 00:31:24,509
We got a show in about
two and a half hours.

813
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:27,303
Who can do a pump up?

814
00:31:27,345 --> 00:31:29,681
Who can pump everybody up?

815
00:31:29,723 --> 00:31:31,307
Yeah okay, go for it.

816
00:31:31,349 --> 00:31:34,102
- You can either meditate or
take some Quaaludes and relax.

817
00:31:36,021 --> 00:31:38,398
- She said, "Do you
have a pump up for us?".

818
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,985
- Oh, well I'd love
some more champagne.

819
00:31:42,027 --> 00:31:44,487
- Evana, can you
pump everybody up?

820
00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:47,657
- You could either keep your
mouth shut or open it wide.

821
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:49,284
(group laughs)

822
00:31:49,325 --> 00:31:50,660
- Tom, you gotta pump up?

823
00:31:50,702 --> 00:31:51,995
- We're going out there.

824
00:31:52,037 --> 00:31:53,705
We're gonna slay
them with jokes.

825
00:31:53,747 --> 00:31:55,165
We're gonna kill them.

826
00:31:55,206 --> 00:31:57,167
Ain't gonna have nothing left.

827
00:31:57,208 --> 00:31:59,711
We're gonna lay them lying
in the aisles laughing

828
00:31:59,753 --> 00:32:02,213
and gasping for air.

829
00:32:02,255 --> 00:32:03,840
- One two three, jokes!

830
00:32:03,882 --> 00:32:04,674
(group cheers)

831
00:32:04,716 --> 00:32:06,009
One two three, jokes!

832
00:32:06,051 --> 00:32:07,552
- [Group] One two three, jokes!

833
00:32:07,594 --> 00:32:10,013
- So, Tom, I couldn't
help but notice

834
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:12,057
that you were not at the class.

835
00:32:13,224 --> 00:32:14,851
Can you account for
your whereabouts?

836
00:32:14,893 --> 00:32:17,103
- I was at my 9,
8:30 to 4:30 job.

837
00:32:17,145 --> 00:32:18,104
What's that?

838
00:32:18,146 --> 00:32:19,856
- That is HR.

839
00:32:19,898 --> 00:32:21,191
- You work in HR?
- Yeah.

840
00:32:21,232 --> 00:32:24,361
And they don't know
about my, this life.

841
00:32:24,402 --> 00:32:26,154
- They don't?
- No.

842
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:28,156
It's like seriously is a secret.

843
00:32:28,198 --> 00:32:29,407
- Wow.
- Yeah.

844
00:32:29,449 --> 00:32:30,575
- Secret.
- I know.

845
00:32:30,617 --> 00:32:31,826
- Well it's safe with
me, I won't tell.

846
00:32:31,868 --> 00:32:33,370
- Thank you.

847
00:32:33,411 --> 00:32:35,288
- And so, so you're kind of
at this other level though.

848
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:37,290
You're, you're doing comedy.

849
00:32:37,332 --> 00:32:39,584
You've been doing comedy
professionally for a long time.

850
00:32:39,626 --> 00:32:42,087
What does it feel
like being in a group

851
00:32:42,128 --> 00:32:44,631
where these people are doing
comedy maybe for the first
time?

852
00:32:44,673 --> 00:32:46,383
- I realize this is
not their background.

853
00:32:46,424 --> 00:32:47,717
They might've been professional
people and all that.

854
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:50,512
But it's one of the
things I enjoy the most.

855
00:32:50,553 --> 00:32:52,263
Actually, when they give
somebody their answer, they go,

856
00:32:52,305 --> 00:32:53,848
"Oh, what's going
to happen next?"

857
00:32:54,933 --> 00:32:55,892
- Who would play you in a movie?

858
00:32:55,934 --> 00:32:57,227
- Al Pacino.

859
00:32:57,268 --> 00:32:58,895
- Who do you like to
make laugh the most?

860
00:32:58,937 --> 00:33:00,271
- The senior citizens

861
00:33:00,313 --> 00:33:03,233
because they're not
the usual comedy crowd.

862
00:33:03,274 --> 00:33:05,402
I think they take more
of a liking to me.

863
00:33:05,443 --> 00:33:07,153
Well, a few don't and
they throw things.

864
00:33:07,195 --> 00:33:08,488
But other than that.

865
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:10,198
But then again, how far
can they throw things,

866
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,449
you know, at that age?

867
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:12,992
You know, I can't either.

868
00:33:13,034 --> 00:33:14,619
I'm not making fun of them,
you know, I, you know.

869
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:17,163
But anywhere I could get
a laugh, I'm fine with.

870
00:33:17,205 --> 00:33:19,249
- Ah, I'm doing jokes.

871
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:22,043
So you better get
this party started.

872
00:33:22,085 --> 00:33:23,169
- [Jo] Helen, you got one?

873
00:33:23,211 --> 00:33:24,295
- This is a song I...

874
00:33:24,337 --> 00:33:25,839
My first song I wrote.

875
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,632
No, I wrote another
song before that called

876
00:33:27,674 --> 00:33:28,842
Charlie Is My Love.

877
00:33:28,883 --> 00:33:33,096
*Toy balloon toy balloon *

878
00:33:33,138 --> 00:33:38,226
* As you float up in the air*

879
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,813
* John, Jacob
Jingleheimer Schmidt. *

880
00:33:41,855 --> 00:33:44,524
*His name is my name to*

881
00:33:44,566 --> 00:33:45,483
- God forbid.

882
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:47,610
*When we go out*

883
00:33:47,652 --> 00:33:49,195
We're gonna get
back to the theater,

884
00:33:49,237 --> 00:33:51,239
we're gonna do a tech rehearsal.

885
00:33:51,281 --> 00:33:53,324
And then we're going
to do the show.

886
00:33:53,366 --> 00:33:55,744
And then, and, and then
you guys have the rest

887
00:33:55,785 --> 00:33:59,873
of your nights to take the party
bus, you know, around town.

888
00:34:00,957 --> 00:34:01,833
- What about lunch?

889
00:34:05,837 --> 00:34:07,464
- So, what you're gonna do is

890
00:34:07,505 --> 00:34:09,132
you're gonna, someone's
gonna open the curtain

891
00:34:09,174 --> 00:34:10,967
when your name is called.

892
00:34:11,009 --> 00:34:13,094
You're gonna go
through the curtain

893
00:34:13,136 --> 00:34:14,971
and you're going to
grab this microphone.

894
00:34:15,013 --> 00:34:17,057
And this is my other joke.

895
00:34:17,098 --> 00:34:19,309
And it just became
three minutes.

896
00:34:19,351 --> 00:34:20,602
Everybody see?

897
00:34:20,643 --> 00:34:22,354
Raise your hand if
you see the red light.

898
00:34:22,395 --> 00:34:24,439
I'm just gonna announce you
and then you'll come up.

899
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:25,940
And if you need familiarity,

900
00:34:25,982 --> 00:34:27,984
if you're good on the
mic don't worry about it.

901
00:34:28,026 --> 00:34:29,027
- I'd like to try.

902
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:29,986
- Okay, we'll go in order.

903
00:34:30,028 --> 00:34:31,279
How about that?

904
00:34:31,321 --> 00:34:32,280
- I've never spoken
in a mic before.

905
00:34:32,322 --> 00:34:33,531
Just speak into it?
- Yeah.

906
00:34:34,908 --> 00:34:35,825
- Good evening.

907
00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:37,035
Good afternoon everybody.

908
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:38,995
- Tom comes up to the stage.

909
00:34:39,037 --> 00:34:40,830
- Oh.
- Thank you.

910
00:34:40,872 --> 00:34:41,664
- Smooth.

911
00:34:41,706 --> 00:34:42,540
- I'm Richard.

912
00:34:42,582 --> 00:34:44,501
And and a bar walked into...

913
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:45,210
No wait.

914
00:34:45,251 --> 00:34:46,169
A guy walked into...

915
00:34:46,211 --> 00:34:48,088
A bartender went into the zoo.

916
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:50,173
- Barbara Bova.

917
00:34:50,215 --> 00:34:52,175
- Yeah. Hi everyone.

918
00:34:52,217 --> 00:34:53,760
- Ugh.
- There you go.

919
00:34:53,802 --> 00:34:55,428
- Hello I'm Helen Yalof.

920
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:58,807
- Okay, coming up to the
stage next it's Evana Lewis.

921
00:35:00,308 --> 00:35:01,976
- Hello. My name is Evana Lewis.

922
00:35:02,018 --> 00:35:03,228
I love to dance.

923
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:04,813
Is there any tables
in this audience?

924
00:35:04,854 --> 00:35:05,855
- Okay.

925
00:35:05,897 --> 00:35:07,315
- Hello there.

926
00:35:07,357 --> 00:35:09,109
- New York New York
wonderful town.

927
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,193
- Thank you.

928
00:35:10,235 --> 00:35:12,404
- Yay. Hello everybody.

929
00:35:12,445 --> 00:35:14,489
Coming to our performance.

930
00:35:14,531 --> 00:35:15,740
- And then you just
want to make sure

931
00:35:15,782 --> 00:35:17,242
that mic stays right
in front of your mouth.

932
00:35:17,283 --> 00:35:18,868
- Oh.
- Yeah.

933
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:20,453
- Hello, mic.

934
00:35:20,495 --> 00:35:21,996
And hi, everybody else.

935
00:35:22,038 --> 00:35:24,791
I wanna thank you all for
coming to my bar mitzvah.

936
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:26,918
- I can say you're
an actress and a singer?

937
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,923
- I actually am a producer,
entertainer, playwright.

938
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:36,344
- You hate me.

939
00:35:36,386 --> 00:35:37,220
- I don't hate you.

940
00:35:37,262 --> 00:35:38,304
- Sometimes I hate you.

941
00:35:38,346 --> 00:35:39,431
- Sometimes you hate me.

942
00:35:39,472 --> 00:35:41,141
- That's so great.

943
00:35:41,182 --> 00:35:42,517
How'd you make this?

944
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:44,144
- Wanting to be a playwright,

945
00:35:44,185 --> 00:35:46,062
my advice to you is
to drop this for now

946
00:35:46,104 --> 00:35:47,397
and do something else.

947
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:50,692
- Are you gonna be
doing the curtain?

948
00:35:58,825 --> 00:36:01,578
(general chit chat)

949
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:02,454
- Hi.

950
00:36:04,372 --> 00:36:06,624
- Blah blah blah blah blah.

951
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:10,670
Honey.

952
00:36:10,712 --> 00:36:11,338
Okay okay.
- Okay.

953
00:36:11,379 --> 00:36:12,714
- Okay okay.

954
00:36:18,303 --> 00:36:20,513
- Hi everybody.

955
00:36:20,555 --> 00:36:23,641
(audience applause)

956
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,105
Thank you all for being here.

957
00:36:29,147 --> 00:36:31,566
You're a beautiful crowd.

958
00:36:31,608 --> 00:36:34,027
These people are very odd.

959
00:36:34,069 --> 00:36:37,655
I don't think there's a
regular one amongst them.

960
00:36:39,032 --> 00:36:41,951
Has anyone been to a 2:00
PM comedy show before?

961
00:36:41,993 --> 00:36:43,078
(audience laughs)

962
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,037
Oh, you have.

963
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:44,871
Okay, so you got the vibe.

964
00:36:44,913 --> 00:36:46,498
The vibe is nasty.

965
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:50,043
I'm constantly shocked by what
everybody says in this group.

966
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:54,089
But I'm excited
to start the show.

967
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:55,674
(audience applause)

968
00:36:55,715 --> 00:36:56,883
- He's an incredible comedian.

969
00:36:56,925 --> 00:36:58,510
It's Tom Petavano.

970
00:37:00,261 --> 00:37:03,807
- I come from a poor family,
but let me tell you something.

971
00:37:03,848 --> 00:37:08,853
Every night my mother
had food on the table.

972
00:37:09,562 --> 00:37:11,147
I wish we had plates.

973
00:37:11,189 --> 00:37:13,525
(audience laughs)

974
00:37:13,566 --> 00:37:15,360
And then I'll never
forget this saying,

975
00:37:15,402 --> 00:37:20,073
"Mommy, I wanted a toy
truck for my birthday.

976
00:37:20,115 --> 00:37:23,326
"I didn't get one, I'm upset."

977
00:37:23,368 --> 00:37:26,663
She goes, "Shut up
you're 40 years old."

978
00:37:26,705 --> 00:37:28,289
- I love getting older.

979
00:37:28,331 --> 00:37:30,166
You know, I'm losing my hair,

980
00:37:30,208 --> 00:37:31,626
but I know where it's going.

981
00:37:31,668 --> 00:37:33,670
It's going to my knuckles.

982
00:37:35,213 --> 00:37:36,464
I love getting older.

983
00:37:36,506 --> 00:37:39,676
You know, at Wendy's I
get my coffee for free.

984
00:37:39,718 --> 00:37:41,344
Give it up for getting older.

985
00:37:41,386 --> 00:37:42,345
(audience applause)

986
00:37:42,387 --> 00:37:44,389
- My name is Helen Yalof.

987
00:37:45,765 --> 00:37:47,976
And if you ever meet me,
you can remind me of that.

988
00:37:49,102 --> 00:37:51,688
Jo, are you sure the
doors are locked, now?

989
00:37:53,773 --> 00:37:58,028
- I have been an aspiring
actress for the past 15 years

990
00:37:58,069 --> 00:38:00,321
and I'm still aspiring, so.

991
00:38:00,363 --> 00:38:03,450
(audience applause)

992
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:06,703
- This next comedian coming
to the stage would like

993
00:38:06,745 --> 00:38:10,540
for me to tell you that
she is a great dancer.

994
00:38:10,582 --> 00:38:12,584
Put your hands together
for Evana Lewis.

995
00:38:13,752 --> 00:38:15,253
- So, I went into
the dentist he said,

996
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:16,796
"How are you doing Ms. Lewis?"

997
00:38:16,838 --> 00:38:20,800
I said, "Doc, can you
give me implant instead

998
00:38:20,842 --> 00:38:22,719
of putting back my partial?

999
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:25,263
He said, "No, you have
to make an appointment".

1000
00:38:25,305 --> 00:38:27,640
"I was so disappointment".

1001
00:38:29,726 --> 00:38:32,103
- My boss ever sees
this, I'm dead.

1002
00:38:32,145 --> 00:38:35,065
(audience applause)

1003
00:38:36,566 --> 00:38:37,525
Now I get to eat.

1004
00:38:38,985 --> 00:38:41,404
- You know, I had my
thing under notes.

1005
00:38:41,446 --> 00:38:42,906
Now I can't find it.

1006
00:38:42,947 --> 00:38:44,616
It's called Justice.

1007
00:38:46,284 --> 00:38:48,244
Oh, you found it.

1008
00:38:48,286 --> 00:38:49,621
- Nicki Cochrane.

1009
00:38:49,662 --> 00:38:52,332
(audience applause)

1010
00:38:52,374 --> 00:38:54,084
- Well, good
afternoon and welcome.

1011
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:57,420
I'm so delighted that
you all came to watch us.

1012
00:38:57,462 --> 00:39:00,090
There are people,
millions of people

1013
00:39:00,131 --> 00:39:03,802
who say they believe
every word of the Bible.

1014
00:39:03,843 --> 00:39:05,136
Okay, fine.

1015
00:39:05,178 --> 00:39:08,765
But then I want them to
be logical and be aware

1016
00:39:08,807 --> 00:39:11,935
of the consequences
of their belief.

1017
00:39:11,976 --> 00:39:14,979
The Bible says an eye for an
eye and a tooth for a tooth.

1018
00:39:15,021 --> 00:39:18,274
So, I want you to follow
those consequences.

1019
00:39:18,316 --> 00:39:21,277
The Bible advocates that.

1020
00:39:21,319 --> 00:39:25,323
Our legal system today has
no connection to justice,

1021
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:26,908
but in the ancient world,

1022
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:30,453
they really, they really
cared about justice.

1023
00:39:30,495 --> 00:39:33,289
- I was on a plane
and I overheard

1024
00:39:33,331 --> 00:39:34,791
the conversation behind me.

1025
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:38,586
It was a southern girl
asking a northern girl,

1026
00:39:38,628 --> 00:39:40,296
"So, where you all from?".

1027
00:39:40,338 --> 00:39:42,173
And the snooty
northern girl says,

1028
00:39:42,215 --> 00:39:44,801
"Well, I'm from a place
where they know better than

1029
00:39:44,843 --> 00:39:47,679
to end the sentence
in a preposition".

1030
00:39:47,721 --> 00:39:51,641
She goes, "So where
are y'all from, bitch?"

1031
00:39:51,683 --> 00:39:54,102
(audience applause)

1032
00:39:54,144 --> 00:39:58,565
Actually, that was
from Playboy magazine.

1033
00:39:58,606 --> 00:40:00,692
- Lynne, that was great.

1034
00:40:02,944 --> 00:40:04,487
- My mother, my
mother was a saint.

1035
00:40:04,529 --> 00:40:06,865
I brought you inside
and I raised you.

1036
00:40:06,906 --> 00:40:09,701
I fed you, you little
son of a bitch.

1037
00:40:09,743 --> 00:40:12,620
- Oh, I can't say that.

1038
00:40:12,662 --> 00:40:15,457
- I mean you little shit ass.

1039
00:40:15,498 --> 00:40:17,208
Thank you.

1040
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,627
- That little shit ass.

1041
00:40:19,669 --> 00:40:21,504
Coming up next to the stage,

1042
00:40:21,546 --> 00:40:25,425
he's ridiculous but we love him.

1043
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:29,179
It is Bill Burke
everybody, Bill Burke.

1044
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,347
- Oh my god.

1045
00:40:30,388 --> 00:40:33,308
(audience applause)

1046
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:38,188
- My wife left me recently.

1047
00:40:42,108 --> 00:40:42,984
I was really sad.

1048
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:44,903
I was depressed.

1049
00:40:46,404 --> 00:40:47,739
I went out and I bought a puppy.

1050
00:40:47,781 --> 00:40:49,699
I bought a new motorcycle.

1051
00:40:49,741 --> 00:40:51,868
Spent a lot of money
on drugs and alcohol.

1052
00:40:52,994 --> 00:40:53,912
She's going to be really pissed

1053
00:40:53,953 --> 00:40:56,122
when she gets home from work.

1054
00:40:56,164 --> 00:40:59,042
(audience applause)

1055
00:41:00,585 --> 00:41:02,962
- My new thesaurus is terrible.

1056
00:41:03,004 --> 00:41:04,756
Not only that, it's terrible.

1057
00:41:08,176 --> 00:41:10,345
What's red and bad for your
teeth?

1058
00:41:11,471 --> 00:41:12,389
A brick.

1059
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:15,100
(audience laughs)

1060
00:41:15,141 --> 00:41:15,934
My name is Bill.

1061
00:41:15,975 --> 00:41:17,477
This has been my Ted Talk.

1062
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:18,687
Thank you.

1063
00:41:18,728 --> 00:41:20,480
(audience applause)

1064
00:41:20,522 --> 00:41:21,898
- He's so naughty.

1065
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,694
- It's just terrific.

1066
00:41:28,154 --> 00:41:30,073
- This next comedian
coming to the stage.

1067
00:41:30,115 --> 00:41:33,368
She's the Seamus
at her synagogue.

1068
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:35,245
It is Barbara Bova.

1069
00:41:37,956 --> 00:41:41,334
- Two jumper cables walk
in and the bartender says,

1070
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:46,214
"Hey, you two, don't you
start anything in here".

1071
00:41:46,256 --> 00:41:50,176
Julius Cesar walks in and
he asks for a martinez.

1072
00:41:51,469 --> 00:41:54,556
The bartender says, "Don't
you mean a martini?"

1073
00:41:54,597 --> 00:41:56,016
And he said, "No.

1074
00:41:56,057 --> 00:41:58,018
"If I would have wanted two,

1075
00:41:58,059 --> 00:41:59,853
"I would have asked
for a double.".

1076
00:41:59,894 --> 00:42:03,732
- I was debating, how do
I kill these cockroaches?

1077
00:42:03,773 --> 00:42:05,775
Do I use a sponge?

1078
00:42:05,817 --> 00:42:07,944
Or do I use my hand?

1079
00:42:07,986 --> 00:42:10,071
Now, yeah, I know
it's disgusting.

1080
00:42:10,113 --> 00:42:12,365
I forgot to give
the trigger warning.

1081
00:42:13,742 --> 00:42:15,118
- If I go for the sponge,

1082
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,370
it takes like one second
to go for the sponge

1083
00:42:17,412 --> 00:42:18,788
before I go for the kill.

1084
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:21,291
That one second is a
really important second.

1085
00:42:21,332 --> 00:42:23,543
You could lose ground
in that one second.

1086
00:42:23,585 --> 00:42:25,879
Oh my God I'm dead.

1087
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,089
- The world is crazy, you know.

1088
00:42:28,131 --> 00:42:29,883
No one knows what's
happening anymore.

1089
00:42:29,924 --> 00:42:32,385
You know, everybody's
done sending.

1090
00:42:32,427 --> 00:42:33,970
Nobody in the woods, you know,

1091
00:42:34,012 --> 00:42:35,680
who is going, who is coming.

1092
00:42:35,722 --> 00:42:40,852
And then everything goes, but
it's great, you know. (laughs)

1093
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:44,481
Cause I don't know where I'm
going or coming either, so.

1094
00:42:44,522 --> 00:42:46,232
(audience applause)

1095
00:42:46,274 --> 00:42:47,317
- Orlando Dole

1096
00:42:48,693 --> 00:42:51,279
- If you asked me to
describe my figure,

1097
00:42:51,321 --> 00:42:54,115
I wouldn't say that I
was an apple or a pear.

1098
00:42:54,157 --> 00:42:57,494
I'd say I was a soft boiled
egg with breasts and...

1099
00:42:57,535 --> 00:42:59,204
(audience laughs)

1100
00:42:59,245 --> 00:43:02,832
Say you're on a date with a
guy you don't know.

1101
00:43:02,874 --> 00:43:05,877
This is what he expects
you to be wearing. Okay?

1102
00:43:05,919 --> 00:43:07,212
I mean, look at this.

1103
00:43:07,253 --> 00:43:09,255
These are what I
actually am wearing.

1104
00:43:09,297 --> 00:43:12,509
No, I'll show you.

1105
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:13,885
They're great. They're good.

1106
00:43:13,927 --> 00:43:17,055
(audience applause)

1107
00:43:18,473 --> 00:43:20,058
- Alix Elias!

1108
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,646
- They liked you a lot.

1109
00:43:24,688 --> 00:43:25,939
- They liked you too.

1110
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,524
- This next comedian
would like you to know

1111
00:43:27,565 --> 00:43:30,110
that she's been
retired for 30 years

1112
00:43:30,151 --> 00:43:31,945
and she's never been busier.

1113
00:43:32,987 --> 00:43:35,073
The one and only Bibi Elvers.

1114
00:43:40,578 --> 00:43:41,788
- I am a hoarder.

1115
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:44,541
And I don't know how
to get rid of my stuff.

1116
00:43:44,582 --> 00:43:47,293
And I can never find anything.

1117
00:43:47,335 --> 00:43:48,753
This is just some.

1118
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:55,135
My favorite, absolute
favorite toy, when I was a kid

1119
00:43:55,176 --> 00:43:58,096
when I was very young, is this.

1120
00:43:58,138 --> 00:43:59,931
And he has a little
zipper pocket.

1121
00:44:00,724 --> 00:44:02,267
His name is Dog Do.

1122
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:05,270
I didn't speak
English at the time

1123
00:44:05,311 --> 00:44:09,524
but I had heard a few words
and Dog Do sounded just right.

1124
00:44:09,566 --> 00:44:13,069
When, when my husband was
having his knee replaced,

1125
00:44:13,111 --> 00:44:18,742
he begged the doctor to
give him his real bone

1126
00:44:18,783 --> 00:44:19,868
after the operation.

1127
00:44:20,952 --> 00:44:22,245
Well, they're not
allowed to do that,

1128
00:44:22,287 --> 00:44:24,581
but he was a very persistent
man, my husband was.

1129
00:44:24,622 --> 00:44:27,792
And that's what this is.

1130
00:44:30,045 --> 00:44:31,421
These are his bones.

1131
00:44:34,049 --> 00:44:35,967
Then there was my head surgery.

1132
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:41,139
Oh, I can't find it.

1133
00:44:46,686 --> 00:44:49,856
Well, I'll finish down here.

1134
00:44:49,898 --> 00:44:50,774
I'm fine.

1135
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:53,902
(audience applause)

1136
00:44:55,195 --> 00:44:56,821
Two days after the surgery--

1137
00:44:58,823 --> 00:45:01,868
(audience applause)

1138
00:45:04,746 --> 00:45:08,541
This was on my bed table.

1139
00:45:08,583 --> 00:45:10,377
And what it is is the hair

1140
00:45:10,418 --> 00:45:15,131
that they had shaved
off me 30 years ago.

1141
00:45:15,173 --> 00:45:18,551
I think, I think I'm a
little bit lighter now.

1142
00:45:21,221 --> 00:45:23,014
Thanks for being so wonderful.

1143
00:45:23,056 --> 00:45:26,184
(audience applause)

1144
00:45:32,649 --> 00:45:33,608
- Bibi Elvers

1145
00:45:34,693 --> 00:45:36,736
A true, a true champion.

1146
00:45:36,778 --> 00:45:38,947
Incredible.

1147
00:45:38,988 --> 00:45:40,448
- Was that on purpose?

1148
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:41,366
- What?

1149
00:45:41,408 --> 00:45:42,659
- Were you falling on purpose?

1150
00:45:42,701 --> 00:45:45,328
- Put your hands together
for Ziggy Susser.

1151
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:48,498
(audience applause)

1152
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,333
Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

1153
00:45:50,375 --> 00:45:52,002
It was an absolutely
soft landing.

1154
00:45:52,043 --> 00:45:54,546
- We have a pet bird at
home, a small parrot.

1155
00:45:54,587 --> 00:45:55,797
We called him Charlie.

1156
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,841
Bout a year ago,

1157
00:45:57,882 --> 00:45:59,342
my wife was getting
up off the couch

1158
00:45:59,384 --> 00:46:01,344
and she accidentally
stepped on him,

1159
00:46:01,386 --> 00:46:03,388
flattened him out
like a pancake.

1160
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:06,349
He was okay but they
brought me to the vet

1161
00:46:06,391 --> 00:46:08,935
and she said, "He doesn't
have any brain damage .

1162
00:46:08,977 --> 00:46:10,145
"He doesn't have
any broken bones".

1163
00:46:10,186 --> 00:46:11,396
I said, "How do you know?".

1164
00:46:11,438 --> 00:46:12,772
She said, "He answered
all our questions."

1165
00:46:12,814 --> 00:46:14,774
"We asked him who
brought you here?".

1166
00:46:14,816 --> 00:46:17,444
He said, "Big foot".

1167
00:46:17,485 --> 00:46:19,696
We asked him, "How did
the universe start?".

1168
00:46:19,738 --> 00:46:22,157
He said, "Big bang".

1169
00:46:22,198 --> 00:46:24,034
We asked him who's
your favorite character

1170
00:46:24,075 --> 00:46:25,577
on Sesame Street?".

1171
00:46:25,618 --> 00:46:27,328
He said, "Cookie Monster".

1172
00:46:29,664 --> 00:46:31,666
I thought he would
say Big Bird too.

1173
00:46:33,126 --> 00:46:34,044
I'm Ziggy Susser.

1174
00:46:34,085 --> 00:46:35,545
Thanks, you've been great.

1175
00:46:35,587 --> 00:46:38,506
(audience applause)

1176
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:42,177
- Ziggy Susser everybody.

1177
00:46:42,218 --> 00:46:43,803
- Okay and if you
could just give

1178
00:46:43,845 --> 00:46:46,890
a big round of applause to
everybody you saw tonight.

1179
00:46:46,931 --> 00:46:48,725
If we could see
everybody take a bow.

1180
00:46:48,767 --> 00:46:54,689
(audience applause)

1181
00:46:57,817 --> 00:47:02,697
(light piano music)

1182
00:47:09,621 --> 00:47:12,374
I just wanted to say
how great everybody was.

1183
00:47:12,415 --> 00:47:15,043
And it was really a great
experience working with you.

1184
00:47:15,085 --> 00:47:16,252
And I just wanted
to give everybody

1185
00:47:16,294 --> 00:47:18,421
a rose like we're
on The Bachelor. Ok?

1186
00:47:18,463 --> 00:47:20,465
- Wonderful.

1187
00:47:23,259 --> 00:47:26,388
- Where did they wire the mic?

1188
00:47:26,429 --> 00:47:27,764
- They did not.

1189
00:47:27,806 --> 00:47:30,308
- Honey. I'll see you at home.

1190
00:47:31,476 --> 00:47:32,936
- How would you
like some pictures

1191
00:47:32,977 --> 00:47:35,021
from the back showing
all the seats?

1192
00:47:35,063 --> 00:47:36,064
- But it's empty.

1193
00:47:36,106 --> 00:47:37,399
Even though it's empty?

1194
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,900
- But it shows you how
many seats were here.

1195
00:47:38,942 --> 00:47:40,193
It's still cool.

1196
00:47:41,653 --> 00:47:43,655
- Did you guys help each
other write your sets

1197
00:47:43,697 --> 00:47:44,698
or did you write
them yourselves?

1198
00:47:44,739 --> 00:47:45,782
- We sort of fought over it.

1199
00:47:45,824 --> 00:47:46,991
We had a fight?

1200
00:47:49,035 --> 00:47:50,787
- I think we're
doing a group photo.

1201
00:47:50,829 --> 00:47:51,663
- Oh that'd be great.

1202
00:47:51,705 --> 00:47:53,164
I'd like to be in that.

1203
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:55,583
- I think what would
be Kind of funny is if

1204
00:47:55,625 --> 00:47:57,669
you lied down in the front,
you know what I mean,

1205
00:47:57,711 --> 00:47:59,713
with the rose maybe.

1206
00:47:59,754 --> 00:48:00,547
Exactly.

1207
00:48:01,923 --> 00:48:06,511
- When I get up in the
morning, you smile, you laugh

1208
00:48:06,553 --> 00:48:08,722
because that's a
beginning of the day

1209
00:48:08,763 --> 00:48:10,306
and that will help you
go through the day.

1210
00:48:10,348 --> 00:48:13,184
Because the start off
with that energy in you

1211
00:48:14,144 --> 00:48:15,645
and that laugh.

1212
00:48:15,687 --> 00:48:17,689
And then you go on to
share it with someone else.

1213
00:48:17,731 --> 00:48:18,773
And you keep them happy.

1214
00:48:20,191 --> 00:48:21,401
It doesn't matter they
might have a bad day,

1215
00:48:21,443 --> 00:48:23,903
but you give them a joke
and they start laughing.

1216
00:48:23,945 --> 00:48:25,321
You feel good.

1217
00:48:26,698 --> 00:48:31,327
Laughter it's like food
you put in your body.

1218
00:48:32,162 --> 00:48:35,040
It keeps you going.

1219
00:48:35,081 --> 00:48:36,666
It energize you.

1220
00:48:36,708 --> 00:48:37,751
It keep you happy.

1221
00:48:39,085 --> 00:48:40,837
And you know that you
go through the day,

1222
00:48:40,879 --> 00:48:44,132
it's love and joy.

1223
00:48:45,508 --> 00:48:47,719
You're not supposed to let
anybody take away your joy,

1224
00:48:47,761 --> 00:48:49,387
just keep on smiling.

1225
00:48:52,891 --> 00:48:53,683
I love it.

1226
00:48:57,604 --> 00:48:59,147
- I'm gonna ask you
to finish the joke.

1227
00:48:59,189 --> 00:49:01,191
Guy walks into a bar.

1228
00:49:01,232 --> 00:49:02,942
- And he's not an alcoholic.

1229
00:49:02,984 --> 00:49:04,194
They throw him out.

1230
00:49:04,235 --> 00:49:08,406
- Say, "I want a
tequila on the rocks".

1231
00:49:08,448 --> 00:49:10,408
- A guy walks into the bar,

1232
00:49:11,534 --> 00:49:13,286
"Have you seen my
friend Phoebe?"

1233
00:49:13,328 --> 00:49:15,497
"Phoebe who's to hell's Phoebe.

1234
00:49:15,538 --> 00:49:18,708
"That's what I like to know
where the hell is Phoebe?"

1235
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:19,709
- That's a joke?

1236
00:49:19,751 --> 00:49:20,293
- No, that's not exactly.

1237
00:49:20,335 --> 00:49:21,461
That's not it.

1238
00:49:21,503 --> 00:49:24,089
- He ordered a beer on the rocks

1239
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:26,132
and the bartender said,
"You're not old enough.

1240
00:49:26,174 --> 00:49:28,134
"And besides we don't have any."

1241
00:49:28,176 --> 00:49:29,886
- Two friends are
sitting on a bus.

1242
00:49:29,928 --> 00:49:30,804
- One throws up.

1243
00:49:33,306 --> 00:49:36,643
- Two friends are sitting
on a bus and...

1244
00:49:36,685 --> 00:49:41,898
- One says, move to the
rear and the other leaves.

1245
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:42,857
- Then what happens?

1246
00:49:44,067 --> 00:49:46,069
- That's a good question.

1247
00:49:46,111 --> 00:49:48,279
- Two friends are
sitting on a bus.

1248
00:49:48,321 --> 00:49:49,072
- And they didn't
pay their fare.

1249
00:49:49,114 --> 00:49:49,989
They're thrown off.

1250
00:49:50,031 --> 00:49:52,450
(Jo laughs)
