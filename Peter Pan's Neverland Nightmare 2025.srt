1
00:00:01,551 --> 00:00:04,299
(haunting music)

2
00:00:11,896 --> 00:00:14,525
(suspenseful music)

3
00:00:18,995 --> 00:00:22,014
"La la la la la la"

4
00:00:23,729 --> 00:00:26,531
Neverland was a world
that every child dreamed about.

5
00:00:27,425 --> 00:00:30,426
A land where mermaids swam
in the crystal-clear waters...

6
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:34,572
...of the lagoon, where boys
could shoot bows and arrows...

7
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:36,781
...and play pirates aboard
the Jolly Roger.

8
00:00:37,691 --> 00:00:39,473
A land where every desire...

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,753
...every wish could be granted
to the boys by fairies.

10
00:00:43,436 --> 00:00:45,630
No evil darkness
hung over Neverland.

11
00:00:45,949 --> 00:00:47,452
The children were happy...

12
00:00:47,639 --> 00:00:49,702
...and could be friends
till the end of time.

13
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:54,433
Sleep did not exist, rules
did not exist, and above all...

14
00:00:54,831 --> 00:00:57,558
...there were no parents
to tell the little boys...

15
00:00:58,144 --> 00:01:00,180
...what they should or
should not do.

16
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,537
This utopia, this world
was offered only...

17
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,211
...to the most special little boys.

18
00:01:07,677 --> 00:01:10,186
Peter ruled the island
having been ordered...

19
00:01:10,249 --> 00:01:13,534
...by a higher being to ensure
that the best children...

20
00:01:13,597 --> 00:01:16,156
...were invited to stay
in Neverland forever.

21
00:01:16,362 --> 00:01:19,482
This was Peter's gift to
grant the boys their wish...

22
00:01:19,687 --> 00:01:20,746
...to never grow up.

23
00:01:22,256 --> 00:01:24,428
With the promise that Peter...

24
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,530
...would be able to join the little
boys in Neverland for good.

25
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:29,176
Hm.

26
00:01:31,144 --> 00:01:32,165
Oh.

27
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,388
But first he had
a mission to complete.

28
00:01:34,816 --> 00:01:38,034
"La la la la la la"

29
00:01:38,275 --> 00:01:43,906
So, I think
that it's time for you...

30
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:45,929
...to go to Netherland, Curly.

31
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:46,909
Hm?

32
00:01:48,224 --> 00:01:49,321
What do you say?

33
00:01:51,928 --> 00:01:54,114
(Peter chuckles)

34
00:01:54,671 --> 00:01:57,869
(haunting music continues)

35
00:02:00,341 --> 00:02:03,354
(suspenseful music)

36
00:02:04,368 --> 00:02:06,434
(dark ominous music)

37
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:10,125
(circus patrons laughing)

38
00:02:12,397 --> 00:02:14,818
(circus patrons chattering)

39
00:02:15,147 --> 00:02:15,934
Come on, Mom!

40
00:02:15,997 --> 00:02:17,122
It's about to start!

41
00:02:18,902 --> 00:02:20,457
Hurry, hurry.

42
00:02:22,614 --> 00:02:24,086
Hurry inside now.

43
00:02:24,149 --> 00:02:25,155
Hurry, hurry.

44
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:29,629
(circus patrons cheering)

45
00:02:29,865 --> 00:02:34,688
(dramatic music)
(circus patrons applauding)

46
00:02:42,035 --> 00:02:44,799
(ominous music)

47
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,706
(Peter hushes)

48
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,431
(chilling music)

49
00:03:21,776 --> 00:03:24,440
(ominous music)

50
00:03:47,383 --> 00:03:50,387
(suspenseful music)

51
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:00,384
(ominous music)

52
00:04:03,552 --> 00:04:07,143
(circus patrons applauding)

53
00:04:11,054 --> 00:04:14,739
Right. I'm going for a shower
and by the time I'm done...

54
00:04:15,307 --> 00:04:16,838
...I want you upstairs
doing your teeth.

55
00:04:18,448 --> 00:04:19,127
Come on.

56
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:20,084
(James groans)

57
00:04:20,356 --> 00:04:23,226
(Roxy clicks tongue)

58
00:04:26,756 --> 00:04:29,534
(clothes rustling)

59
00:04:30,764 --> 00:04:32,249
(shower curtain rattling)

60
00:04:32,576 --> 00:04:35,063
(metal screeches)
(water splashing)

61
00:04:35,214 --> 00:04:37,304
(Peter chuckles)

62
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,948
(floor creaks)

63
00:04:49,418 --> 00:04:50,277
Hey!

64
00:04:51,346 --> 00:04:52,287
Wakey, wakey.

65
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,869
(Peter chuckles)

66
00:04:53,931 --> 00:04:54,701
(James inhales deeply)

67
00:04:54,963 --> 00:04:55,670
Wakey, wakey.

68
00:04:55,812 --> 00:04:56,370
(James gasps)

69
00:04:56,432 --> 00:04:57,125
Peekaboo.

70
00:04:57,514 --> 00:04:58,075
Oh.

71
00:05:00,337 --> 00:05:01,393
Oh, don't be frightened.

72
00:05:01,994 --> 00:05:06,719
I, uh, I got lost down
here, and it's really cold.

73
00:05:06,843 --> 00:05:07,690
Hm.

74
00:05:08,029 --> 00:05:09,150
I lost my mummy.

75
00:05:09,782 --> 00:05:11,983
- You lost your mum?
- Mm-hmm.

76
00:05:12,922 --> 00:05:15,638
And I'm really scared,'cause it's,
it's really dark...

77
00:05:15,754 --> 00:05:18,557
...and I don't want
my mummy to be mad at me.

78
00:05:19,601 --> 00:05:22,287
(water splashing)

79
00:05:29,057 --> 00:05:30,954
How did you get down there?

80
00:05:31,252 --> 00:05:32,477
(Peter grunts)

81
00:05:32,725 --> 00:05:37,998
Well, I was walking along,
and then I...

82
00:05:38,473 --> 00:05:42,187
...I slipped and fell into darkness.

83
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:44,000
Oh, gosh.

84
00:05:45,369 --> 00:05:46,547
Oh, silly me.

85
00:05:46,609 --> 00:05:48,710
I'm not allowed
to talk to strangers.

86
00:05:49,662 --> 00:05:50,509
I'll get Mummy.

87
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,137
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

88
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:53,501
We're not strangers at all.

89
00:05:53,636 --> 00:05:54,845
(Peter chuckles)

90
00:05:55,077 --> 00:05:57,902
Today I caught you a balloon.

91
00:05:58,098 --> 00:05:59,107
Don't you remember me?

92
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:00,871
From the circus. Mm-hmm.

93
00:06:01,273 --> 00:06:02,758
- That was you?
- Mm-hmm.

94
00:06:02,908 --> 00:06:03,932
Indeed, it was.

95
00:06:04,271 --> 00:06:06,027
Hey, I guess that
means we're friends.

96
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:07,171
(Peter chuckles)

97
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,370
- Let me get Mum.
- Oh, no, no, no.

98
00:06:10,573 --> 00:06:11,544
You'll make her mad.

99
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:14,927
We don't need two angry
mummies now, do we? Hm.

100
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:19,372
You're a bit old to
need your mum, aren't you?

101
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:22,057
(Peter hushes)

102
00:06:22,273 --> 00:06:23,139
It's late.

103
00:06:23,315 --> 00:06:24,371
We should go to bed.

104
00:06:25,726 --> 00:06:26,560
I'm Peter.

105
00:06:26,698 --> 00:06:27,795
It's nice to meet you.

106
00:06:28,571 --> 00:06:29,372
Mm?

107
00:06:32,168 --> 00:06:33,270
Mm-hmm.

108
00:06:33,556 --> 00:06:36,271
(Peter chuckles)

109
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:38,884
(ominous music)

110
00:06:39,223 --> 00:06:40,201
I'm James.

111
00:06:40,726 --> 00:06:41,790
(Peter gasps)

112
00:06:42,143 --> 00:06:42,983
James.

113
00:06:45,937 --> 00:06:46,840
(Peter chuckles)

114
00:06:46,903 --> 00:06:48,635
Hey, I have an idea.

115
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,650
You could...

116
00:06:51,021 --> 00:06:52,976
No, no, actually, no.

117
00:06:54,423 --> 00:06:56,366
- No, forget I said anything.
- What?

118
00:06:56,429 --> 00:06:57,285
No, no, no.

119
00:06:57,691 --> 00:07:00,150
- I don't think you're brave enough.
- I'm very brave.

120
00:07:00,318 --> 00:07:01,103
Tell me.

121
00:07:01,165 --> 00:07:01,844
(Peter chuckles)

122
00:07:01,906 --> 00:07:03,114
Okay, come here.

123
00:07:04,747 --> 00:07:06,113
(ominous music)

124
00:07:06,362 --> 00:07:07,907
There's a place
where all the kids go...

125
00:07:09,368 --> 00:07:10,924
...somewhere
I could take you if you like.

126
00:07:11,543 --> 00:07:13,315
Home, it's a world of dreams.

127
00:07:14,971 --> 00:07:16,483
You don't have bedtimes there.

128
00:07:16,691 --> 00:07:17,418
Mm.

129
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,413
No more mummies.

130
00:07:20,076 --> 00:07:22,187
I think you'd make
the perfect Lost Boy.

131
00:07:22,383 --> 00:07:23,172
(Peter chuckles)

132
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,075
In Neverland you're
gonna have so much fun.

133
00:07:25,137 --> 00:07:27,831
- No! No, he's not!
- No, don't take him.

134
00:07:27,894 --> 00:07:29,100
He's my friend!

135
00:07:30,019 --> 00:07:30,751
(groans)

136
00:07:30,813 --> 00:07:32,847
Get off! No! No!

137
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:34,902
Give him to me!

138
00:07:34,964 --> 00:07:36,704
(food thuds)
(wood clatters)

139
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,601
Go! Please go!

141

Fucking bitch!

142
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:45,184
You...

143
00:07:45,393 --> 00:07:48,390
(Peter grunts)

144
00:07:48,828 --> 00:07:51,185
(James pants)

145
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:54,908
What is it?

146
00:07:54,971 --> 00:07:57,829
Take this. Take the
phone, and you'll be fine.

147
00:07:57,998 --> 00:07:58,890
You'll be fine.

148
00:07:59,957 --> 00:08:00,877
I'll be back, okay?

149

155
00:08:39,683 --> 00:08:41,378
I need to take you with me.

You ruin this for me?

Mm?

00:09:17,984 --> 00:09:20,071
(Roxy gurgles)

171
00:09:20,357 --> 00:09:22,870
(objects clattering)

172
00:09:25,183 --> 00:09:28,865
(metal clinking)
(Roxy groaning)

173
00:09:29,668 --> 00:09:32,463
(Roxy screams)

174
00:09:37,241 --> 00:09:40,298
(flesh squishing)

175
00:09:40,598 --> 00:09:43,210
(chilling music)

176
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,798
(Roxy gags)

177
00:09:53,753 --> 00:09:56,179
(body thuds)

178
00:09:56,349 --> 00:10:01,146
(ominous music)
(Peter panting)

179
00:10:11,129 --> 00:10:12,203
Hello?

180
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:13,423
Hello?

181
00:10:13,703 --> 00:10:14,831
Is anyone there?

182
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:19,975
Stay on the line.
I'm sending police to your location.

183
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:24,218
Aren't you a wonderful boy.

184
00:10:24,472 --> 00:10:26,851
(James gasping)

185
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,446
Would you like to come
to Neverland with me now?

186
00:10:31,508 --> 00:10:34,355
Hm?
(dramatic music)

187
00:10:39,787 --> 00:10:42,158
What happened to
sharing the chores, guys?

188
00:10:42,221 --> 00:10:43,793
That lasted about five minutes.

189
00:10:43,987 --> 00:10:45,831
You were supposed
to sort this, John.

190
00:10:46,297 --> 00:10:47,191
- Mom.
- One thing.

191
00:10:47,254 --> 00:10:49,928
I asked you to do one thing
and you can't even do that.

192
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,158
Mum, can you not see that...

193
00:10:51,221 --> 00:10:52,236
- ...I'm working right now?
- Yeah, you've had...

194
00:10:52,299 --> 00:10:53,678
- ...ages to do that.
- Oh no, no.

195
00:10:54,851 --> 00:10:57,376
Wendy, I need you to
take Michael to school.

196
00:10:57,594 --> 00:10:58,749
Perkins are taking John...

197
00:10:58,811 --> 00:11:01,159
- ...but they haven't got any space.
- Yeah, that's fine. Why not.

198
00:11:01,678 --> 00:11:03,105
I don't need anyone to take me.

199
00:11:03,699 --> 00:11:04,683
I've got my bike.

200
00:11:04,878 --> 00:11:06,834
Yeah, which you
only got this morning.

201
00:11:06,897 --> 00:11:07,701
Mum.

202
00:11:07,763 --> 00:11:09,788
Oh, you can practice
riding around the block...

203
00:11:09,851 --> 00:11:12,074
...before you even think about
riding to school. (car horn honks)

204
00:11:12,743 --> 00:11:14,672
Right, that's me. I am off.

205
00:11:14,976 --> 00:11:17,831
Mum, um, could I borrow
a fiver please?

206
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,033
I'll pay you back next week
when Dad gives me my weekly.

207
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,016
You say this every week,
I never see it.

208
00:11:22,204 --> 00:11:24,324
- So, what-
- I asked you to do one chore.

209
00:11:24,386 --> 00:11:25,703
No, absolutely not.

210
00:11:25,765 --> 00:11:27,778
Goodness sake.
It's five pounds, Mum.

211
00:11:30,745 --> 00:11:31,458
(door thuds)

212
00:11:31,521 --> 00:11:33,255
I heard from your dad this morning.

213
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:34,253
Can you believe it?

214
00:11:35,935 --> 00:11:39,272
I hope John's not expecting him
to make an effort this weekend.

215
00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:41,075
(Mom chuckles)

216
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,079
He's more than likely
otherwise engaged.

217
00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:44,988
Oof.

218
00:11:45,051 --> 00:11:46,954
Dad said he'll get
me the drone I wanted.

219
00:11:47,795 --> 00:11:50,278
Oh, now, Michael, you know
that's not gonna happen.

220
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,951
I told you, you're not old enough.

221
00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:54,527
And those things are
really expensive.

222
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,782
I don't think your dad's gonna
fork out for that, do you?

223
00:11:57,294 --> 00:11:58,683
Michael, you need to be ready.

224
00:11:58,975 --> 00:12:00,440
I don't wanna be late again, okay?

225
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:04,725
Have a lovely day.

226
00:12:05,686 --> 00:12:08,549
By the way, Wendy, this
came this morning from UCL.

227
00:12:10,516 --> 00:12:11,795
Why are you opening my letters?

228
00:12:11,953 --> 00:12:13,448
(Mom scoffs)

229
00:12:13,921 --> 00:12:16,122
I thought you were really
looking forward to going.

230
00:12:16,384 --> 00:12:18,030
No, I never said that.

231
00:12:18,093 --> 00:12:18,966
That's what you said.

232
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,613
Is this because of this guy?

233
00:12:22,898 --> 00:12:23,848
(Mom sighs)

234
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,793
Wendy, you gotta get your
head screwed on...

235
00:12:25,855 --> 00:12:29,709
...or you'll end up just working
nine-to-five in some shit job.

236
00:12:30,047 --> 00:12:32,474
Wow. Maybe that's what I want, so...

237
00:12:35,623 --> 00:12:37,312
Fuck.

238
00:12:37,951 --> 00:12:38,695
Shit.

239
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:39,902
Aw, you too.

240
00:12:39,964 --> 00:12:41,639
You're just like your dad.

241
00:12:43,818 --> 00:12:45,650
(door thuds)
(Mom sighs)

242
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,122
Michael!

243
00:12:48,316 --> 00:12:50,239
- Michael!
- Aw, no.

244
00:12:50,806 --> 00:12:52,569
(Wendy groans)

245
00:12:52,631 --> 00:12:54,040
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Hold that.

246
00:12:54,718 --> 00:12:55,865
I've got something to say to you.

247
00:12:55,994 --> 00:12:59,246
- "Happy birthday to you"
- Stop!

248
00:12:59,308 --> 00:13:02,411
- "Happy birthday to you"
- So annoying, stop!

249
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,632
"Happy birthday"

250
00:13:03,695 --> 00:13:04,991
(Wendy groans)

251
00:13:05,149 --> 00:13:06,683
- Michael!
- I hate you.

252
00:13:06,746 --> 00:13:09,623
"Happy birthday to you"

253
00:13:09,685 --> 00:13:11,802
- I hate you.
- Aw, I love you.

254
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,273
Oh, new bike.

255
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:16,443
Very nice. From Mum?

256
00:13:17,366 --> 00:13:18,280
Well, she's got a point, you know.

257
00:13:18,343 --> 00:13:19,820
You don't be doing
that long journey...

258
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,459
...to school on
your new bike, do you?

259
00:13:21,775 --> 00:13:22,984
I want to ride my bike.

260
00:13:23,047 --> 00:13:25,004
You're not gonna make
it in time, are you?

261
00:13:25,621 --> 00:13:27,590
Come on, I'll give you a lift.

262
00:13:27,747 --> 00:13:29,539
Follow me this way.
Come on, come on.

263
00:13:30,825 --> 00:13:33,065
We can do car karaoke.

264
00:13:34,116 --> 00:13:35,777
Hurry up, you're gonna be late.

265
00:13:36,813 --> 00:13:38,825
- Sorry.
- Okay?

266
00:13:40,418 --> 00:13:41,672
I forgot your birthday.

267
00:13:42,957 --> 00:13:44,944
Look, I'll, I'll take you out
for ice cream after school.

268
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:46,173
Yeah?

269
00:13:46,384 --> 00:13:47,354
How about that?

270
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:48,995
Wanna go Brownies?

271
00:13:51,185 --> 00:13:52,138
Brownies.

272
00:13:53,018 --> 00:13:54,145
Come on.

273
00:13:54,207 --> 00:13:55,507
It's your favorite.

274
00:13:55,987 --> 00:13:58,018
Don't leave me hanging, otherwise
I'll just have to go all...

275
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,163
...by myself and
sit there like a loner.

276
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,820
- You are a loner.
- Oy!

277
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,118
I deserve that.

278
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:09,734
But for me, please?

279
00:14:12,178 --> 00:14:13,689
Are you still going to London?

280
00:14:14,365 --> 00:14:15,605
I'm just figuring it out.

281
00:14:15,868 --> 00:14:17,640
Ah, you're so obsessed with him.

282
00:14:17,844 --> 00:14:18,929
Michael.

283
00:14:19,144 --> 00:14:21,946
Look one day you'll meet
someone that you'll really like...

284
00:14:22,008 --> 00:14:23,763
...and you'll realize
that you need...

285
00:14:23,826 --> 00:14:26,854
...to do certain
things to keep them.

286
00:14:29,048 --> 00:14:30,078
But...

287
00:14:30,285 --> 00:14:33,851
Look, Michael, we all need
to grow up at some point...

288
00:14:33,913 --> 00:14:36,880
...and at some point
we need to move out...

289
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:39,075
...and get on with our adult lives.

290
00:14:40,571 --> 00:14:42,772
It's nothing to be
angry about, okay?

291
00:14:43,918 --> 00:14:46,562
I'm always gonna be your
annoying big sister.

292
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,883
(Wendy laughs)

293
00:14:49,394 --> 00:14:50,051
Come on.

294
00:14:50,113 --> 00:14:50,907
(upbeat music)

295
00:14:51,172 --> 00:14:52,853
Just before school. sLet's go.

296
00:14:53,055 --> 00:14:54,280
Woo, woo, woo!

297
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:56,638
Scoot, scoot, let's go!

298
00:14:57,465 --> 00:15:00,481
"Runaway runaway runaway from you"

299
00:15:00,544 --> 00:15:02,797
(bell ringing)

300
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,900
(car doors thudding)

301
00:15:08,183 --> 00:15:09,700
All set?

302
00:15:09,762 --> 00:15:11,033
I hate Mum for this.

303
00:15:11,096 --> 00:15:14,644
- Everyone will think it's girly.
- Who cares? Screw them.

304
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:15,778
Hug.

305
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,150
- I'm not kissing you.
- Oh, all right. Okay.

306
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:20,878
- Where am I putting this?
- Over there next to the others.

307
00:15:21,122 --> 00:15:23,055
Okay, are we still going out
for ice cream after school?

308
00:15:23,182 --> 00:15:24,514
(Michael sighs)

309
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:25,676
Hi, Joey. Are you all right?

310
00:15:25,738 --> 00:15:27,721
- You're late.
- I know, I know.

311
00:15:29,733 --> 00:15:33,549
(ominous music)
(birds chirping)

312
00:15:33,722 --> 00:15:37,988
"To die will be"

313
00:15:38,476 --> 00:15:41,308
"An old folly"

314
00:15:41,902 --> 00:15:44,461
"You got an angel"

315
00:15:45,956 --> 00:15:49,126
"To die will be"

316
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:53,070
"An old folly"

317
00:15:53,648 --> 00:15:55,927
"You got an angel"

318
00:15:56,498 --> 00:16:01,276
(Peter coughs)
(Tinkerbell hums)

319
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:08,609
(water splashing)

320
00:16:12,749 --> 00:16:13,860
It's time to collect.

321
00:16:14,281 --> 00:16:17,147
(suspenseful music)

322
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:21,666
(bugs chirping)

323
00:16:24,597 --> 00:16:27,744
(chilling music)
(door rumbling)

324
00:16:28,097 --> 00:16:29,672
(door thuds)
(suspenseful music)

325
00:16:29,911 --> 00:16:30,933
Oh, fuck.

326
00:16:32,179 --> 00:16:35,330
- She's been asking where you are.
- Oh, fuck. I know, I know.

327
00:16:36,443 --> 00:16:37,490
Wendy, the time.

328
00:16:37,553 --> 00:16:38,236
I know, I'm sorry...

329
00:16:38,299 --> 00:16:39,797
- ...it was my brother's birthday and I
- I didn't ask for your life story.

330
00:16:39,859 --> 00:16:40,786
You're late, okay? Again.

331
00:16:40,849 --> 00:16:43,255
One more time this week and I'm
gonna need to dock those wages.

332
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,613
The letter came today.

333
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,082
About me scheduling my gap year.

334
00:16:48,145 --> 00:16:49,666
I thought my mum was gonna flip out.

335
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,224
Well, it's not her decision, is it?

336
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,463
If you wanna do your thing,
then do it.

337
00:16:53,526 --> 00:16:57,052
If you wanna go into the
city with Ronnie, go for it.

338
00:16:57,658 --> 00:16:58,524
Yeah?

339
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:01,188
What's that face?

340
00:17:03,194 --> 00:17:04,625
He's completely ghosted me.

341
00:17:05,514 --> 00:17:06,440
I don't know what's happening.

342
00:17:07,049 --> 00:17:08,119
It's like we had this plan...

343
00:17:08,181 --> 00:17:10,397
...and now he's not even
answering my calls.

344
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:13,226
- Well, how long's he aired you?
- Like a day.

345
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:16,104
But he was acting off
all about it before that.

346
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:18,249
I don't know what's happening.

347
00:17:18,311 --> 00:17:21,378
It's like a switch in
his brain or something...

348
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,355
...about the whole thing.

349
00:17:22,418 --> 00:17:23,918
Well, can't you just cancel
the gap year...

350
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,991
...and go to Uni instead?

351
00:17:25,115 --> 00:17:25,953
Mia!

352
00:17:26,219 --> 00:17:28,647
No, it's very official.

353
00:17:31,139 --> 00:17:33,533
Well, me and the girls are
doing a glamping trip tonight...

354
00:17:33,596 --> 00:17:34,686
...if you girls wanna come.

355
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,290
Jamie's coming.

356
00:17:36,877 --> 00:17:37,995
The phone.

357
00:17:39,069 --> 00:17:40,186
The phone.

358
00:17:40,415 --> 00:17:42,295
(phone ringing)

359
00:17:42,357 --> 00:17:43,577
For God's sake.

360
00:17:46,216 --> 00:17:47,588
(ominous music)

361
00:17:47,756 --> 00:17:51,054
(plastic rustling)

362
00:17:51,228 --> 00:17:52,480
(ominous music)

363
00:17:52,753 --> 00:17:54,335
Aye, we're closed.

364
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:58,409
(ominous music continues)

365
00:18:00,652 --> 00:18:03,219
(bear squeaks)

366
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:21,895
(suspenseful music)

367
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,590
(eerie music)

368
00:18:37,732 --> 00:18:40,151
(sighs) You're such a pretty boy.

369
00:18:40,884 --> 00:18:43,895
Would you like to come to
Neverland with me, hmm?

370
00:18:45,131 --> 00:18:47,551
(ominous music)

371
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,433
Hi.

372
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,143
I'm Peter.

373
00:18:59,986 --> 00:19:02,351
Mate, were closed!

374
00:19:05,247 --> 00:19:06,355
You hearing me?

375
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,930
(chilling music)

376
00:19:21,387 --> 00:19:22,579
(dramatic music)
(gasps) Freak!

377
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:24,237
You're gonna pay for that.

378
00:19:25,988 --> 00:19:28,619
(Peter exhales)

379
00:19:29,012 --> 00:19:33,783
(knife thuds)
(dramatic music)

380
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,249
(body thuds)

381
00:19:43,635 --> 00:19:46,133
(knife clinks)

382
00:19:46,445 --> 00:19:49,055
(sinister music)

383
00:19:53,134 --> 00:19:55,883
(door dings)

384
00:19:56,082 --> 00:19:58,693
(birds chirping)

385
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,678
(hand pats)

386
00:20:04,934 --> 00:20:06,798
- So, your birthday, yeah?
- Uh-huh.

387
00:20:07,065 --> 00:20:09,779
But you've not kissed a
girl and how old are you now?

388
00:20:10,136 --> 00:20:12,379
Carl, fuck off.
This is our table.

389
00:20:12,441 --> 00:20:14,119
Also, get your mum to
check your hair.

390
00:20:14,265 --> 00:20:16,456
It's infested with
knits and it's gross.

391
00:20:17,853 --> 00:20:19,800
- I think this is yours.
- Fuck off.

392
00:20:22,669 --> 00:20:24,107
He's so pathetic.

393
00:20:24,795 --> 00:20:27,206
How about if he does it
again, we'll get some payback.

394
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,220
Here you go.

395
00:20:35,784 --> 00:20:37,969
You wanna go to the cinema
this weekend?

396
00:20:38,145 --> 00:20:39,052
Yes.

397
00:20:43,184 --> 00:20:45,694
(bell rings)

398
00:20:57,627 --> 00:20:58,695
(dramatic music)
(Wendy yelps)

399
00:20:58,921 --> 00:20:59,856
Ronnie!

400
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,628
What the fuck? Where have you been?

401
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:03,489
- [Ronnie] Yeah, sorry.
- I've been calling you.

402
00:21:03,552 --> 00:21:04,579
[Ronnie] I, I, I've been busy.

403
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:05,734
Busy what?

404
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:07,018
Why have you been ignoring me?

405
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,435
[Ronnie] No.
(ominous music)

406
00:21:10,371 --> 00:21:12,876
(sinister music)

407
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:16,913
No. Look, I, I'm not ignoring you.

408
00:21:17,101 --> 00:21:18,578
Well, you are, so...

409
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,583
I've just been thinking, okay?

410
00:21:21,243 --> 00:21:22,644
About moving to the city.

411
00:21:23,106 --> 00:21:26,394
And I think I'm gonna stay.

412
00:21:26,772 --> 00:21:28,541
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

413
00:21:28,728 --> 00:21:30,562
But you pressured me.

414
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:31,790
- I pressured you.
- Yes...

415
00:21:31,853 --> 00:21:33,498
...and I got caught
up in your excitement.

416
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:34,681
- I didn't know-
- Ronnie!

417
00:21:34,744 --> 00:21:35,986
Hey buddy. Are you okay?

418
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,558
I'm sorry, okay?

419
00:21:41,018 --> 00:21:43,946
(bike rattling)

420
00:21:44,227 --> 00:21:46,755

(dark music)

423
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,537
(suspenseful music)

424

(bike thuds)
(Michael shrieks)

425

428
00:22:28,477 --> 00:22:31,388
(bike wheel ticking)

(sinister music continues)

432
00:23:00,393 --> 00:23:01,481
(dramatic music)

433
00:23:01,768 --> 00:23:03,326
[Peter] You need to come with me.

434
00:23:06,138 --> 00:23:06,936
Get up!

435
00:23:07,175 --> 00:23:10,448
(dramatic music continues)

436
00:23:12,361 --> 00:23:13,461
[Michael] Help!

437
00:23:14,195 --> 00:23:15,203
Come on!

438
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,194
(both grunting)

439
00:23:20,463 --> 00:23:23,637
(dramatic music continues)

440
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,022
(door thuds)

441
00:23:41,198 --> 00:23:42,474
Is he in detention...

442
00:23:42,536 --> 00:23:43,631
- ...or something?
- I've already told you...

443
00:23:43,988 --> 00:23:45,786
...he's not marked down
for being in detention.

444
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:47,372
What time should you
have picked him up?

445
00:23:47,434 --> 00:23:49,109
[Wendy] (chuckles) Well,
I was there on time, I...

446
00:23:50,224 --> 00:23:51,180
[Receptionist] I can
call his tutor for you...

447
00:23:51,243 --> 00:23:53,386
...and see whether he's in any
after-school activities.

448
00:23:53,449 --> 00:23:54,637
[Wendy] Yes, please.

449
00:23:54,952 --> 00:23:59,695
(engine rumbling)
(suspenseful music)

450
00:24:07,693 --> 00:24:12,411
(crickets chirping)

451
00:24:18,068 --> 00:24:20,475
(door clicks)

452
00:24:32,207 --> 00:24:33,315
[Michael] Who, who are you?

453
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,048
I'm Peter.

454
00:24:40,669 --> 00:24:43,079
(eerie music)

455
00:24:51,219 --> 00:24:54,057
(suspenseful music)

456
00:24:58,015 --> 00:24:58,886
Peter Pan.

457
00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:02,231
Oh, don't be frightened.

458
00:25:02,873 --> 00:25:04,586
I'm just a big ol'teddy bear.

459
00:25:07,812 --> 00:25:11,956
My mother, she used to
do terrible things to me.

460
00:25:14,531 --> 00:25:16,749
And when she would do
things to make me upset,

461
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:18,865
I'd close my eyes.

462
00:25:20,491 --> 00:25:22,864
Can you close your eyes, Michael?

463
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,835
Hm?

464
00:25:25,834 --> 00:25:27,887
Close them.
(sinister music)

465
00:25:28,199 --> 00:25:30,838
Oh, good boy.

466
00:25:35,879 --> 00:25:39,728
And I would dream of this
magical place.

467
00:25:41,652 --> 00:25:45,288
Oh, it would be filled
with children our age...

468
00:25:46,791 --> 00:25:49,376
...and we'd play all day
and all night long...

469
00:25:51,246 --> 00:25:52,923
...and I wouldn't be scared anymore.

470
00:25:54,325 --> 00:25:58,049
So when you get scared,
just think of that place...

471
00:25:59,526 --> 00:26:00,534
...because it's real.

472
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,187
It's real, Michael.

473
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:16,400
(ominous music)

474
00:26:18,984 --> 00:26:21,096
What I'm giving you for your
birthday is the greatest gift...

475
00:26:21,158 --> 00:26:22,486
...a child could ever ask for.

476
00:26:27,215 --> 00:26:29,498
(door clicks)

477
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,057
(door thuds)

478
00:26:35,146 --> 00:26:37,658
(dramatic music)

479
00:26:41,313 --> 00:26:42,963
[Officer] So there's
no problems at home.

480
00:26:43,026 --> 00:26:44,541
[John] No, not at all. He's fine.

481
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:46,535
- He's just-
- [Mom] No, but he is a shy...

482
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:49,096
...shy, vulnerable little boy.

483
00:26:49,448 --> 00:26:51,780
He wouldn't just run away,
you know that.

484
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,476
He's not off on some adventure.

485
00:26:53,538 --> 00:26:54,873
Maybe he's just out
with his friends, Mum.

486
00:26:54,935 --> 00:26:56,885
He hasn't got any fucking
friends, John.

487
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:57,905
Christ.

488
00:26:57,968 --> 00:26:59,333
This is from the school.

489
00:27:01,931 --> 00:27:04,175
(Mom exhales)

490
00:27:07,026 --> 00:27:08,846
[Wendy] Oh, look.
(Mom cries)

491
00:27:08,908 --> 00:27:10,201
[Mom] Oh, my God. There he is.

492
00:27:10,263 --> 00:27:12,001
- [Wendy] I didn't see him.
- [Mom] How could you not see him?

493
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:13,004
Where did he go?

494
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:15,212
I mean, if you wasn't
actually there, Wendy.

495
00:27:15,275 --> 00:27:16,201
It's okay.

496
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,310
[John] Wendy.

497
00:27:19,894 --> 00:27:23,193
No, I was there,
I was just distracted.

498
00:27:25,456 --> 00:27:26,281
What?

499
00:27:28,277 --> 00:27:31,532
You were just, you were distracted?

500
00:27:31,595 --> 00:27:33,602
What do you mean,
you were distracted?

501
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:37,126
- I can't, I can't do this.
- [Mom] Distracted?

502
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:38,135
I can't do this.

503
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,546
(Wendy pants)

504
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:45,425
(phone ringing)

505
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,663
I'll get it.

506
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,461
Hello?

507
00:27:52,635 --> 00:27:54,144
(upbeat carnival music)

508
00:27:54,431 --> 00:27:55,716
(ominous music)

509
00:27:55,999 --> 00:27:56,796
Hello?

510
00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:01,884
Who is it?

511
00:28:01,947 --> 00:28:03,118
Is it Michael?

512
00:28:04,645 --> 00:28:05,687
(Wendy gasps)

513
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:06,720
Hello?

514
00:28:06,857 --> 00:28:08,627
(upbeat carnival music continues)

515
00:28:08,863 --> 00:28:09,688
Who is this?

516
00:28:18,732 --> 00:28:19,666
Who are you?

517
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,154
(flesh squishing)

518
00:28:30,614 --> 00:28:32,200
[Peter] Don't worry about Michael.

519
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:35,236
Please. @@

520
00:28:36,088 --> 00:28:37,802
I'm gonna take him to Neverland.

521
00:28:39,828 --> 00:28:41,469
Who are you?

522
00:28:42,348 --> 00:28:43,648
This isn't happening.

523
00:28:43,887 --> 00:28:45,473
This is not happening.

524
00:28:48,085 --> 00:28:50,661
You sick fuck.

525
00:28:50,724 --> 00:28:53,335
(phone clatters)
(keys jingling)

526
00:28:53,547 --> 00:28:55,747
(door clicks)

527
00:28:58,432 --> 00:29:00,173
(door slams)

528
00:29:03,971 --> 00:29:06,198
(Wendy gasps)

529
00:29:08,397 --> 00:29:10,908
(sinister music)

530
00:29:12,361 --> 00:29:14,807
(door squeaks)

531
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:21,113
(Peter breathing shakily)

532
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,638
[Peter] Hey, kid.

533
00:29:34,812 --> 00:29:35,821
I can't sleep.

534
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,870
You awake?

535
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,570
I know you're awake.

536
00:29:47,506 --> 00:29:48,484
You want to play a game?

537
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,858
Oh, a game's always fun, isn't it?

538
00:29:53,747 --> 00:29:54,553
Let's see.

539
00:29:55,506 --> 00:29:59,895
Oh, how about a good
old game of Marco Polo?

540
00:30:01,095 --> 00:30:02,213
You know that game?

541
00:30:04,028 --> 00:30:07,711
I'll go and hide,
and you have to find me.

542
00:30:09,251 --> 00:30:10,048
Are you ready?

543
00:30:11,789 --> 00:30:12,724
Close your eyes.

544
00:30:13,998 --> 00:30:14,941
Count to 10.

545
00:30:16,206 --> 00:30:21,014
One, two, three...

546
00:30:22,745 --> 00:30:27,071
...four, five, six...

547
00:30:28,313 --> 00:30:30,586
...seven, eight...

548
00:30:31,585 --> 00:30:33,537
...nine, 10.

549
00:30:34,907 --> 00:30:37,346
(eerie music)

550
00:30:42,452 --> 00:30:46,003
(Michael breathing shakily)

551
00:30:52,805 --> 00:30:54,203
[Michael] Marco.

552
00:30:58,116 --> 00:30:59,241
[Peter] Polo.

553
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:03,455
(suspenseful music)

554
00:31:05,709 --> 00:31:08,578
(Michael gasping)

555
00:31:10,654 --> 00:31:13,215
(ominous music)

556
00:31:17,949 --> 00:31:19,093
Marco.

557
00:31:19,346 --> 00:31:20,271
[Peter] Polo.

558
00:31:20,574 --> 00:31:25,857
(dramatic music)
(Michael gasping)

559
00:32:08,562 --> 00:32:11,365
(foot tapping)

560
00:32:11,586 --> 00:32:14,152
(glass clinking)

561
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:19,303
(Michael breathing shakily)

562
00:32:22,556 --> 00:32:25,028
(glass clinking)

563
00:32:25,186 --> 00:32:27,755
(wood rattling)

564
00:32:29,249 --> 00:32:33,961
(glass shatters)
(dramatic music)

565
00:32:38,828 --> 00:32:41,691
(suspenseful music)

566
00:33:00,782 --> 00:33:01,515
Marco.

567
00:33:02,652 --> 00:33:06,381
(Michael breathes shakily)

568
00:33:10,887 --> 00:33:13,454
(plastic rustling)

569
00:33:17,678 --> 00:33:19,970
Polo!
(dramatic music)

570
00:33:20,211 --> 00:33:22,613
(Peter coughs)

571
00:33:28,184 --> 00:33:30,805
(Peter panting)

572
00:33:34,305 --> 00:33:37,253
(sinister music)

573
00:33:37,586 --> 00:33:38,364
Oh.

574
00:33:51,573 --> 00:33:53,516
Oh, are these your friends?

575
00:33:54,062 --> 00:33:55,189
He, he's my friend.

576
00:33:55,638 --> 00:33:56,374
Joey.

577
00:33:56,436 --> 00:33:57,516
Oh, Joey.

578
00:33:58,993 --> 00:34:01,791
Oh. Would, would you like it
if I brought Joey here too?

579
00:34:01,854 --> 00:34:02,690
No, no, no, no.

580
00:34:02,849 --> 00:34:05,348
- I, I don't want him here.
- Oh, oh.

581
00:34:05,806 --> 00:34:10,425
Oh, now, Michael, you're
a special, special boy.

582
00:34:11,906 --> 00:34:16,416
I see great things for you,
hm, in a place where you...

583
00:34:16,479 --> 00:34:19,555
...can be a little boy for
the rest of your existence.

584
00:34:20,985 --> 00:34:23,862
Living the most incredible life.

585
00:34:24,513 --> 00:34:25,403
Mm.

586
00:34:26,173 --> 00:34:29,114
And I could let Joey come with you.

587
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,663
Hm.

588
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:33,416
(Peter coughs)

589
00:34:37,849 --> 00:34:40,539
(upbeat carnival music)

590
00:34:40,956 --> 00:34:43,963
You know, my mother used
to play this song to me...

591
00:34:44,026 --> 00:34:45,579
...and the other
little boys at school.

592
00:34:52,384 --> 00:34:54,393
What happened to your mother?

593
00:34:54,595 --> 00:34:57,013
(sniffs) No, you don't
need to worry about her.

594
00:34:59,259 --> 00:35:01,653
I won't let her touch my boys again.

595
00:35:01,924 --> 00:35:02,991
(ominous music)

596
00:35:03,054 --> 00:35:05,238
[Tiger] Is it true what
they're saying about-

597
00:35:05,301 --> 00:35:06,129
Yeah.

598
00:35:07,412 --> 00:35:08,639
We got the same call.

599
00:35:09,327 --> 00:35:10,639
[Tiger] It's crazy.

600
00:35:10,804 --> 00:35:12,683
They all thought he was
dead, but he's back.

601
00:35:12,921 --> 00:35:14,048
Peter Pan.

602
00:35:14,322 --> 00:35:15,365
They always said
he was out there...

603
00:35:15,428 --> 00:35:17,439
...but everyone forgot
about it and moved on.

604
00:35:22,204 --> 00:35:24,043
Oh, got to go T.

605
00:35:24,371 --> 00:35:25,234
Mm.

606
00:35:25,481 --> 00:35:26,618
Call you later?

607
00:35:30,457 --> 00:35:33,445
(thunder rumbling)

608
00:35:36,649 --> 00:35:38,372
I've looked and looked, I just...

609
00:35:39,682 --> 00:35:41,293
...I just don't know
where to look next.

610
00:35:41,355 --> 00:35:42,706
I've been calling around.

611
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:47,648
Look, Mum, why don't you go to bed?

612
00:35:49,682 --> 00:35:50,580
Get some rest.

613
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,115
If anything happens to him...

614
00:36:14,063 --> 00:36:15,695
...I'll never forgive myself.

615
00:36:18,412 --> 00:36:20,574
(birds chirping)

616
00:36:21,729 --> 00:36:23,557
Look, none of this is
your fault, okay?

617
00:36:24,064 --> 00:36:25,568
- Seriously.
- No.

618
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:28,051
It is.

619
00:36:29,344 --> 00:36:30,943
I wanna help bring him back.

620
00:36:31,695 --> 00:36:32,576
Don't tell Mum.

621
00:36:32,638 --> 00:36:34,166
I'll call in school and
say you're sick.

622
00:36:37,933 --> 00:36:38,877
So where are we going?

623
00:36:39,446 --> 00:36:43,069
I found an address of somebody
in Ashdown who experienced this...

624
00:36:43,953 --> 00:36:45,781
...so I'm gonna see who they are...

625
00:36:46,541 --> 00:36:47,533
...and see what they know.

626
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:50,260
(ominous music)

627
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:55,758
(engine rumbling)

628
00:37:03,281 --> 00:37:04,940
(car door thuds)

629
00:37:05,647 --> 00:37:08,130
(doorbell rings)

630
00:37:14,737 --> 00:37:17,351
(birds chirping)

631
00:37:21,056 --> 00:37:23,333
Incredibly sorry for
what you're going through.

632
00:37:26,163 --> 00:37:28,816
Back then we'd leave
the doors unlocked...

633
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:32,285
...in our houses like there
was nothing to fear.

634
00:37:33,861 --> 00:37:35,172
It was a safe community.

635
00:37:41,162 --> 00:37:43,376
The police never found his,
his body after that...

636
00:37:44,521 --> 00:37:46,113
...awful incident
with that boy's mother.

637
00:37:46,516 --> 00:37:50,018
[Wendy] What happened if I may ask?

638
00:37:51,126 --> 00:37:54,854
When Timmy went missing,
what do you remember?

639
00:37:56,678 --> 00:37:58,795
(Steven sighs)

640
00:37:59,051 --> 00:38:01,031
It was the autumn time.

641
00:38:02,397 --> 00:38:05,018
In the evening, Timmy
asked if he could walk over...

642
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:09,109
...to his friend's house a few
streets down, and so we agreed.

643
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:15,700
Then it got later and later
and, uh, he didn't come home.

644
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:19,375
So I called the friend's home.

645
00:38:20,997 --> 00:38:24,285
They told me that he had never
arrived in the first place.

646
00:38:25,339 --> 00:38:30,372
So I, I was thinking,
where'd he been all that time...

647
00:38:31,544 --> 00:38:32,665
...if he hadn't been there?

648
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:36,744
I mean, that's where
he said he was going.

649
00:38:39,034 --> 00:38:40,125
Then...

650
00:38:40,522 --> 00:38:41,514
Then you got the call.

651
00:38:41,577 --> 00:38:42,307
(ominous music)

652
00:38:42,583 --> 00:38:44,214
[Peter] I'm going to
take him to Netherland.

653
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:50,528
(door creaks)

654
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:05,536
He always told us he felt
like a little girl inside...

655
00:39:06,334 --> 00:39:07,719
...and his mother believed him.

656
00:39:09,844 --> 00:39:14,441
My Timmy was always such a,
a kind child.

657
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:17,278
I still can't after
all these years...

658
00:39:17,681 --> 00:39:19,675
...bring myself to pack
this room away.

659
00:39:20,676 --> 00:39:23,728
I still feel one day there'll
be a knock on the door...

660
00:39:24,305 --> 00:39:25,785
...and my little Timmy
will come home.

661
00:39:27,233 --> 00:39:28,993
I hope they find
your brother, Wendy.

662
00:39:29,405 --> 00:39:30,566
(suspenseful music)

663
00:39:30,916 --> 00:39:31,883
Really, I do.

664
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:33,754
(bell rings)

665
00:39:34,495 --> 00:39:36,987
(children laughing)

666
00:39:39,489 --> 00:39:42,308
(suspenseful music)

667
00:39:45,865 --> 00:39:50,470
(birds chirping)
(engine rumbling)

668
00:39:50,659 --> 00:39:51,676
Look at this.

669
00:39:52,246 --> 00:39:53,557
Right on time.

670
00:39:53,978 --> 00:39:56,314
(Peter chuckles)

671
00:39:57,974 --> 00:39:59,614
Oh, come on, mate.

672
00:40:02,629 --> 00:40:03,845
All right, kids, stay put.

673
00:40:03,907 --> 00:40:05,914
Let me see if I can help this guy.

674
00:40:15,311 --> 00:40:18,755
Sir, if you need a hand
moving it to the side.

675
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:20,900
Huh.

676
00:40:23,383 --> 00:40:26,265
(ominous music)

677
00:40:26,328 --> 00:40:26,894
Oh.

678
00:40:27,068 --> 00:40:30,248
Oh, uh, these old vans,
you know, uh...

679
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:33,559
...always acting up and they're
completely unpredictable.

680
00:40:33,622 --> 00:40:37,284
(driver grunts)
(knife thuds)

681
00:40:37,347 --> 00:40:39,580
(body thuds)

682
00:40:42,531 --> 00:40:45,024
(sinister music)

683
00:40:53,179 --> 00:40:55,812
(water splashing)

684
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,372
(eerie music)

685
00:41:06,588 --> 00:41:07,551
[Child] Hide.

686
00:41:08,916 --> 00:41:11,623
(sinister music)

687
00:41:22,376 --> 00:41:23,265
Well...

688
00:41:29,268 --> 00:41:32,176
(ominous music)
(Peter breathes heavily)

689
00:41:32,533 --> 00:41:34,944
Who wants to come to
Neverland with me, hm?

690
00:41:35,997 --> 00:41:37,054
(Peter chuckles)

691
00:41:37,116 --> 00:41:40,364
(children screaming)
(sinister music)

692
00:41:45,368 --> 00:41:47,868
(door clicks)

693
00:41:50,485 --> 00:41:52,891
(door thuds)

694
00:41:55,672 --> 00:41:58,550
(glass rattling)

695
00:41:59,555 --> 00:42:00,368
Oh.

696
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:04,999
Thank you.

697
00:42:08,124 --> 00:42:09,453
I'm Tinkerbell.

698
00:42:15,015 --> 00:42:16,041
He coughs a lot.

699
00:42:17,279 --> 00:42:19,002
He isn't well, is he?

700
00:42:19,433 --> 00:42:21,621
Oh, he's close to Neverland.

701
00:42:21,785 --> 00:42:24,030
And this is his sign.

702
00:42:24,736 --> 00:42:27,953
That's why he must act now to
take the children with him.

703
00:42:28,347 --> 00:42:29,547
Before it's too late.

704
00:42:34,089 --> 00:42:35,575
[Michael] How long have
you been here?

705
00:42:38,608 --> 00:42:41,155
[Tinkerbell] I was
the first to be chosen.

706
00:42:42,365 --> 00:42:44,621
He keeps you here, doesn't he?

707
00:42:45,115 --> 00:42:47,352
(chuckles) He, he doesn't
keep me here.

708
00:42:47,764 --> 00:42:49,688
So you can leave whenever
you want then.

709
00:42:52,676 --> 00:42:55,439
He's not gonna let me go, is he?

710
00:42:58,637 --> 00:43:03,099
Where Peter takes the
children is a place more special...

711
00:43:03,311 --> 00:43:07,474
...and spectacular than
anyone could ever dream.

712
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:09,385
Why hasn't he taken you there then?

713
00:43:09,862 --> 00:43:11,402
Because I'm different.

714
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:13,784
And I've always been different.

715
00:43:14,664 --> 00:43:17,241
I'm a fairy.

716
00:43:26,795 --> 00:43:28,344
(hand rustling)

717
00:43:28,884 --> 00:43:34,162
One day I'll be a bigger
being, something magical...

718
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:38,802
...where I can be and
do whatever I like.

719
00:43:40,544 --> 00:43:42,916
I just need to follow his guidance.

720
00:43:43,769 --> 00:43:44,933
Same for you.

721
00:43:57,936 --> 00:43:59,220
I'll be back soon.

722
00:44:00,622 --> 00:44:01,665
My family.

723
00:44:03,343 --> 00:44:04,314
They'll miss me...

724
00:44:05,496 --> 00:44:06,595
...if I don't return.

725
00:44:07,988 --> 00:44:09,866
I don't wanna be anywhere else.

726
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:13,249
I was happy.

727
00:44:14,797 --> 00:44:16,850
(door clicks)

728
00:44:17,272 --> 00:44:19,343
(door thuds)

729
00:44:21,184 --> 00:44:23,757
(crickets chirping)

730
00:44:25,647 --> 00:44:28,515
(door rattling)

731
00:44:31,466 --> 00:44:32,575
What's wrong?

732
00:44:32,772 --> 00:44:33,599
(John breathes heavily)

733
00:44:34,011 --> 00:44:34,981
Is it Michael?

734
00:44:35,304 --> 00:44:36,682
- [John] He-
- Is it Michael?

735
00:44:36,935 --> 00:44:39,089
- Have you seen the news?
- No.

736
00:44:40,601 --> 00:44:42,810
What is it? Where is he?
What's happening?

737
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,670
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

738
00:44:46,182 --> 00:44:48,296
(chilling music)

739
00:44:48,924 --> 00:44:49,739
Tell me.

740
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:53,056
Michael's friends.

741
00:44:54,872 --> 00:44:56,528
They found their school bus...

742
00:44:57,077 --> 00:44:59,021
...but they found
the kids in the woods.

743
00:44:59,451 --> 00:45:02,090
(dramatic music)

744
00:45:02,365 --> 00:45:03,327
It's okay.

745
00:45:04,553 --> 00:45:05,365
It's okay.

746
00:45:05,428 --> 00:45:06,377
[John] He's dead.

747
00:45:06,541 --> 00:45:07,641
No, he's not. No.

748
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:10,652
John. John. It's okay.

749
00:45:11,156 --> 00:45:12,228
You're okay.

750
00:45:12,383 --> 00:45:13,529
Just breathe.

751
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:20,005
(door squeaks)

752
00:45:24,666 --> 00:45:25,482
Mum?

753
00:45:28,168 --> 00:45:30,398
(ominous music)

754
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:34,591
Mum?

755
00:45:36,615 --> 00:45:37,386
Come on.

756
00:45:40,895 --> 00:45:41,802
He's gone.

757
00:45:43,763 --> 00:45:44,615
No.

758
00:45:45,788 --> 00:45:46,623
He isn't.

759
00:45:49,511 --> 00:45:50,855
You can't say that.

760
00:45:54,946 --> 00:45:57,099
I think you should go to your dad's.

761
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:02,024
(Wendy sniffles)

762
00:46:02,366 --> 00:46:04,833
(ominous music)

763
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:08,905
(water splashing)

764
00:46:09,212 --> 00:46:11,839
(sinister music)

765
00:46:14,954 --> 00:46:17,338
(metal clatters)

766
00:46:18,711 --> 00:46:22,038
(mumbles indistinctly)

767
00:46:22,405 --> 00:46:24,922
(mumbles indistinctly)

768
00:46:25,293 --> 00:46:27,511
(Peter cackles)

769
00:46:27,822 --> 00:46:30,821
(mumbles indistinctly)

770
00:46:40,833 --> 00:46:42,575
I'll send him to you tonight.

771
00:46:45,283 --> 00:46:47,619
(Peter gasping)

772
00:46:50,947 --> 00:46:53,533
(ominous music)

773
00:46:58,104 --> 00:47:00,123
(dark music)

774
00:47:12,727 --> 00:47:13,937
What are you doing?

775
00:47:16,384 --> 00:47:19,713
Where do they really go?

776
00:47:32,897 --> 00:47:34,216
You know where they go.

777
00:47:35,338 --> 00:47:36,171
I told you.

778
00:47:37,337 --> 00:47:38,811
You don't believe me? Hm?

779
00:47:39,095 --> 00:47:40,149
You think I'm lying?

780
00:47:43,256 --> 00:47:46,276
I always believe you.

781
00:47:47,091 --> 00:47:48,493
(Peter grunts)

782
00:47:48,555 --> 00:47:49,387
Yeah.

783
00:47:50,216 --> 00:47:51,882
- Yes, you do.
- Yeah.

784
00:47:57,326 --> 00:47:58,597
(Tinkerbell moans)

785
00:48:00,788 --> 00:48:01,863
(Tinkerbell grunts)

786
00:48:02,645 --> 00:48:05,229
Don't you ever fucking
question me again!

787
00:48:05,291 --> 00:48:07,401
- Do you understand?
- Yes, I'm sorry!

788
00:48:07,463 --> 00:48:09,841
(Tinkerbell cries)

789
00:48:10,433 --> 00:48:11,846
I'm sorry.

790
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,903
(suspenseful music)

791
00:48:18,419 --> 00:48:19,346
Don't.

792
00:48:19,701 --> 00:48:20,695
Stay!

793
00:48:21,003 --> 00:48:22,186
Don't go.

794
00:48:22,404 --> 00:48:24,712
(suspenseful music continues)

795
00:48:25,146 --> 00:48:27,600
(metal clangs)

796
00:48:30,575 --> 00:48:33,249
What did I tell you about
making a fucking noise?

797
00:48:33,311 --> 00:48:34,409
(object thuds)

798
00:48:34,691 --> 00:48:37,609
- Honestly, fuck being around that.
- Thanks.

799
00:48:37,749 --> 00:48:38,951
But no, it's okay.

800
00:48:40,024 --> 00:48:41,168
I need to be there.

801
00:48:42,407 --> 00:48:43,804
I just needed somewhere to...

802
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:46,100
...you know.

803
00:48:46,574 --> 00:48:48,105
You done with these, girlies?

804
00:48:51,656 --> 00:48:53,912
Right, I'm gonna hit the sack.

805
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:55,506
Joey.

806
00:48:55,987 --> 00:48:57,139
Let's get you to bed.

807
00:48:58,416 --> 00:48:59,564
'Night, Wendy.

808
00:48:59,752 --> 00:49:01,354
I'll pray for Michael tonight.

809
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:03,216
Goodnight, ladies.

810
00:49:04,646 --> 00:49:09,237
Look Wendy, if, if there's
anything we can do...

811
00:49:09,752 --> 00:49:10,635
Thank you.

812
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:15,358
Right, there's, um, blankets
in the downstairs cupboard.

813
00:49:15,421 --> 00:49:16,524
Do you know where they are, T?

814
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:19,195
Yeah, I'm gonna let Wendy
stay in my room tonight.

815
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:21,069
I don't mind staying on the sofa.

816
00:49:21,585 --> 00:49:23,274
- Good girl.
- Right.

817
00:49:23,336 --> 00:49:24,300
Sleep well.

818
00:49:26,003 --> 00:49:27,744
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

819
00:49:28,323 --> 00:49:29,113
Thanks, T.

820
00:49:54,323 --> 00:49:56,223
His first victim, Timmy Carter...

821
00:49:56,285 --> 00:49:59,902
...who was taken when Peter
was just 17 years old.

822
00:50:01,053 --> 00:50:04,482
Reporting from the town of
Norwood where 11 children...

823
00:50:04,714 --> 00:50:07,988
...were taken from their school
bus and brutally murdered.

824
00:50:08,228 --> 00:50:10,956
This comes a day after a
local boy went missing.

825
00:50:11,187 --> 00:50:13,681
The boy cannot be named,
but his family spoke...

826
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:17,177
...of receiving a haunting
phone call from a man.

827
00:50:17,239 --> 00:50:18,360
(phone dings)

828
00:50:22,355 --> 00:50:24,374
(Wendy sighs)

829
00:50:26,055 --> 00:50:30,174
(fire crackling)
(footsteps tapping)

830

Okay?

1005
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:24,786
(Tinkerbell gasps)

1006
01:03:34,932 --> 01:03:36,907
(Peter coughs)

1007
01:03:41,141 --> 01:03:42,214
verything okay?

1008
01:03:43,245 --> 01:03:44,333
(Tinkerbell sniffles)

1009
01:03:45,538 --> 01:03:46,829
(Peter sighs)

1010
01:03:53,999 --> 01:03:54,846
Hm.

1011
01:03:56,538 --> 01:03:59,102
(lighter clicks)

1012
01:04:02,237 --> 01:04:03,978
You know what I'm doing
is for the best.

1013
01:04:04,546 --> 01:04:05,378
Right?

1014
01:04:07,823 --> 01:04:08,745
I can't stop.

1015
01:04:10,210 --> 01:04:12,280
See, it's my duty to send
the kids to Neverland...

1016
01:04:12,343 --> 01:04:13,711
...and protect them from this world.

1017
01:04:16,774 --> 01:04:18,436
What happens...

1018
01:04:20,215 --> 01:04:21,140
...in that room?

1019
01:04:24,191 --> 01:04:26,164
You know every
single person in my life...

1020
01:04:27,959 --> 01:04:29,353
...has left me at some point.

1021
01:04:32,579 --> 01:04:34,655
Well, not you.

1022
01:04:35,564 --> 01:04:36,266
Um.

1023
01:04:36,961 --> 01:04:37,629
(sniffles)

1024
01:04:37,691 --> 01:04:39,152
No, you're special.

1025
01:04:40,090 --> 01:04:40,787
Mm.

1026
01:04:40,923 --> 01:04:42,755
You're different from
the other women I've met.

1027
01:04:43,297 --> 01:04:44,905
Something greater than this world.

1028
01:04:46,872 --> 01:04:48,575
Oh, you'd never leave me.

1029
01:04:50,405 --> 01:04:52,243
So, why don't you
sit down and...

1030
01:04:53,311 --> 01:04:56,436
...have some more of your
magic pixie dust, hm?

1031
01:05:05,254 --> 01:05:06,088
(ominous music)

1032
01:05:06,427 --> 01:05:07,248
Good girl.

1033
01:05:11,608 --> 01:05:12,361
Tell me.

1034
01:05:17,512 --> 01:05:18,418
I think you know.

1035
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:23,619
Why now?

1036
01:05:25,762 --> 01:05:26,759
What's gotten into you?

1037
01:05:28,788 --> 01:05:31,546
(phone buzzing)
(ominous music)

1038
01:05:31,858 --> 01:05:33,097
What the fuck is that?

1039
01:05:34,406 --> 01:05:36,094
(phone buzzes)

1040
01:05:36,251 --> 01:05:37,848
Who the fuck is in this house?

1041
01:05:39,418 --> 01:05:40,346
(Tinkerbell gasps)

1042
01:05:42,553 --> 01:05:43,736
What's going on here, Tinks?

1043
01:05:45,029 --> 01:05:47,148
Don't hurt the boys.

1044
01:05:48,004 --> 01:05:48,737
Hurt?

1045
01:05:49,470 --> 01:05:50,330
Hurt the boys?

1046
01:05:51,809 --> 01:05:53,080
What do you mean hurt them?

1047
01:05:53,712 --> 01:05:54,840
I'm saving them.

1048
01:05:55,570 --> 01:05:58,339
But who the fuck are
you to question me now?

1049
01:06:01,318 --> 01:06:02,784
After all I've done for you.

1050
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:06,151
After all the care...

1051
01:06:06,584 --> 01:06:08,834
...I've given you
when no one else wanted you.

1052
01:06:10,064 --> 01:06:10,879
(Tinkerbell hums)

1053
01:06:12,052 --> 01:06:13,960
And society rejected you.

1054
01:06:16,370 --> 01:06:17,202
Where are they?

1055
01:06:18,879 --> 01:06:21,045
(Tinkerbell breathes shakily)

1056
01:06:21,435 --> 01:06:23,438
(Michael hyperventilating)

1057
01:06:25,614 --> 01:06:26,839
Michael, listen to me.

1058
01:06:27,429 --> 01:06:28,625
You have to trust me.

1059
01:06:28,836 --> 01:06:30,463
(door slams)

1060
01:06:31,454 --> 01:06:33,708
(ominous music)

1061
01:06:35,321 --> 01:06:36,198
He's coming.

1062
01:06:36,588 --> 01:06:37,682
You have to hide.

1063
01:06:38,673 --> 01:06:40,493
(sinister music)

1064
01:06:44,031 --> 01:06:45,087
(door thuds)

1065
01:06:55,607 --> 01:06:56,623
Where's Joey?

1066
01:06:58,298 --> 01:06:59,650
I heard someone in here.

1067
01:07:03,453 --> 01:07:04,285
Where are they?

1068
01:07:07,163 --> 01:07:08,239
Do you know...

1069
01:07:09,514 --> 01:07:11,880
...what happens to
little boys who lie...

1070
01:07:12,493 --> 01:07:13,295
...Michael?

1071
01:07:15,282 --> 01:07:17,029
They don't get to go to Neverland.

1072
01:07:18,619 --> 01:07:20,449
You know what happens instead?

1073
01:07:22,964 --> 01:07:24,912
They live the rest of
their lives...

1074
01:07:26,770 --> 01:07:27,741
...alone.

1075
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,507
And in pain.

1076
01:07:36,449 --> 01:07:41,096
Now do you know how they
get to that place, Michael?

1077
01:07:44,244 --> 01:07:46,798
You see, I, I take my hands...

1078
01:07:48,791 --> 01:07:50,956
...and I put them around
their little throats...

1079
01:07:51,831 --> 01:07:54,220
...and like a snake
I squeeze as tight...

1080
01:07:54,282 --> 01:07:58,446
...as I possibly can till
their blood runs cold.

1081
01:07:58,648 --> 01:07:59,787
- Run!
- (object thuds)

1082
01:07:59,850 --> 01:08:01,912
Michael, run!
Go, go, go!

1083
01:08:02,147 --> 01:08:04,056
(door rattling)

1084
01:08:08,398 --> 01:08:10,677
(ominous music)
(Wendy shrieks)

1085
01:08:11,152 --> 01:08:11,960
No.

1086
01:08:13,113 --> 01:08:14,905
I can't let you go.

1087
01:08:14,968 --> 01:08:17,315
Tinkerbell, please.

1088
01:08:17,590 --> 01:08:18,423
Please.

1089
01:08:19,603 --> 01:08:20,435
Timmy?

1090
01:08:22,353 --> 01:08:24,360
(ominous music)

1091
01:08:25,847 --> 01:08:27,664
I know what happened to you.

1092
01:08:28,629 --> 01:08:30,010
(Tinkerbell gasps)

1093
01:08:30,250 --> 01:08:32,664
Your, your father misses you.

1094
01:08:33,639 --> 01:08:34,472
Huh.

1095
01:08:38,331 --> 01:08:41,062
Michael's family...

1096
01:08:42,894 --> 01:08:44,086
...misses him too.

1097
01:08:47,093 --> 01:08:48,216
You know...

1098
01:08:49,288 --> 01:08:51,049
...what's happening here.

1099
01:08:53,825 --> 01:08:54,929
It isn't right.

1100
01:08:55,846 --> 01:09:00,156
I, I just wanted to go home.

1101
01:09:02,679 --> 01:09:04,137
(ominous music)

1102
01:09:04,489 --> 01:09:06,393
(Tinkerbell shrieks)
(metal clinking)

1103
01:09:07,057 --> 01:09:10,020
(Wendy breathes heavily)

1104
01:09:11,096 --> 01:09:11,928
Hide.

1105
01:09:20,409 --> 01:09:21,628
- Go!
- Bitch!

1106
01:09:23,101 --> 01:09:26,249
(door thudding)
(Peter grunts)

1107
01:09:26,626 --> 01:09:27,397
(Tinkerbell whimpers)

1108
01:09:27,559 --> 01:09:28,478
Where is she?

1109
01:09:29,450 --> 01:09:30,994
(sinister music)

1110
01:09:35,561 --> 01:09:37,666
So, you're playing
with them now, huh?

1111
01:09:38,064 --> 01:09:41,150
(both breathing heavily)

1112
01:09:53,211 --> 01:09:54,026
Joey?

1113
01:09:58,184 --> 01:10:00,484
(Michael breathing shakily)

1114
01:10:09,385 --> 01:10:11,503
999, police
or ambulance, please?

1115
01:10:20,822 --> 01:10:23,486
You lied to me.

1116
01:10:27,897 --> 01:10:28,705
Lied?

1117
01:10:31,364 --> 01:10:33,672
The only ones who lied
to you are those outside.

1118
01:10:34,336 --> 01:10:35,397
For years...

1119
01:10:36,410 --> 01:10:38,724
...I begged and begged...

1120
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:42,022
...to go home,
and you told me...

1121
01:10:42,524 --> 01:10:44,173
...they didn't want me.

1122
01:10:46,143 --> 01:10:47,341
Oh, Tinks.

1123
01:10:51,597 --> 01:10:53,025
(ominous music)

1124
01:10:53,461 --> 01:10:55,539
They don't see you for what you are.

1125
01:10:57,325 --> 01:10:59,560
See, you're meant for
more than this.

1126
01:11:02,030 --> 01:11:06,068
I told you one day you'd
fly with me to Neverland.

1127
01:11:06,950 --> 01:11:08,288
And you do this to me?

1128
01:11:08,955 --> 01:11:09,725
(Tinkerbell cries)

1129
01:11:09,933 --> 01:11:12,294
- You turn your back on me.
- Just stop!

1130
01:11:14,079 --> 01:11:16,288
It's time to stop.

1131
01:11:19,619 --> 01:11:21,678
(suspenseful music)

1132
01:11:40,833 --> 01:11:43,335
(metal clinking)

1133
01:11:44,450 --> 01:11:46,948
(Wendy whimpers)

1134
01:11:48,588 --> 01:11:50,901
(Wendy gasps)

1135
01:11:55,336 --> 01:11:56,560
Are you okay?

1136
01:11:59,103 --> 01:12:00,815
Come with me.
Come on.

1137
01:12:01,210 --> 01:12:02,507
Keep your phone on you.

1138
01:12:02,697 --> 01:12:03,961
We'll be tracking your location.

1139
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:11,561
You know, I don't think you
deserve to go to Neverland.

1140
01:12:13,295 --> 01:12:15,296
You're just a failed Lost Boy.

1141
01:12:19,776 --> 01:12:21,210
Okay, come behind me.

1142
01:12:26,457 --> 01:12:30,246
I don't believe in Neverland.

1143
01:12:31,843 --> 01:12:32,991
Oh, well that's fine...

1144
01:12:34,090 --> 01:12:35,975
...because I never believed
in fairies anyway.

1145
01:12:36,815 --> 01:12:38,439
(both grunting)

1146
01:12:38,914 --> 01:12:41,372
(body thuds)
(glass shattering)

1147
01:12:41,559 --> 01:12:43,965
How dare you fucking betray me!

1148
01:12:44,402 --> 01:12:49,480
(bone crunches)
(Tinkerbell screams)

1149
01:12:51,291 --> 01:12:52,769
(body thuds)

1150
01:12:54,254 --> 01:12:55,688
Fuck with me once...

1151
01:12:55,909 --> 01:12:58,522
(foot thuds)
(Tinkerbell screams)

1152
01:12:58,584 --> 01:13:01,416
(bones crunching)

1153
01:13:09,188 --> 01:13:11,844
Well, you sure as hell
won't fuck with me again.

1154
01:13:12,376 --> 01:13:16,581
(knife thuds)
(Tinkerbell screams)

1155
01:13:33,936 --> 01:13:36,931
(bones crunching)
(blood splattering)

1156
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:39,883
(Tinkerbell whimpers)

1157
01:13:42,034 --> 01:13:42,803
Okay.

1158
01:13:42,865 --> 01:13:44,563
Okay, okay, okay.

1159
01:13:44,822 --> 01:13:45,591
Okay, okay.

1160
01:13:45,654 --> 01:13:46,820
Okay. Hold on.

1161
01:13:47,926 --> 01:13:48,793
(Wendy grunts)

1162
01:13:49,132 --> 01:13:50,709
Okay, it's okay.
Okay.

1163
01:13:53,162 --> 01:13:53,987
Okay.

1164
01:13:54,232 --> 01:13:55,509
Okay, (indistinct).

1165
01:13:55,572 --> 01:13:56,751
Okay, okay.

1166
01:13:56,813 --> 01:13:58,332
(Wendy grunts)

1167
01:13:58,395 --> 01:13:59,158
Fuck.

1168
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:03,661
(wood clacks)
(Wendy grunts)

1169
01:14:03,849 --> 01:14:05,200

01:25:29,708 --> 01:25:30,523
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1338
01:25:30,585 --> 01:25:32,160
So, step aside.

1339
01:25:32,223 --> 01:25:33,965
Um, which one should we do next?

1340
01:25:34,028 --> 01:25:36,865
Let's do this one, which
is not even wrapped.

1341
01:25:36,928 --> 01:25:38,751
(laughing) Oh,
sorry, I was in a rush.

1342
01:25:38,813 --> 01:25:39,727
- Okay.
(phone ringing)

1343
01:25:39,789 --> 01:25:41,628
- Oh, uh...
- Do you wanna guess what it is?

1344
01:25:42,103 --> 01:25:43,175
I'll grab that, guys.

1345
01:25:43,237 --> 01:25:45,491
You go on and open it,
I'll be right back.

1346
01:25:45,902 --> 01:25:46,804
Okay.

1347
01:25:49,006 --> 01:25:49,682
Hello?

1348
01:25:50,173 --> 01:25:52,284
(upbeat carnival music)

1349
01:25:53,621 --> 01:25:55,772
(ominous music)

1350
01:25:58,591 --> 01:26:00,421
- Stop, ooh!
- Do you like'em?

1351
01:26:00,672 --> 01:26:01,727
Yeah.

1352
01:26:01,943 --> 01:26:06,322
(suspenseful music)
(indistinct talking)

1353
01:26:10,236 --> 01:26:12,374
(haunting music)

1354
01:26:52,015 --> 01:26:53,947
(suspenseful music)

1355
01:26:56,716 --> 01:26:58,802
(sinister music)

1356
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:04,010
(sinister music continues)
