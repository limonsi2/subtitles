00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:57,550
Whoo!

549
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:01,096
All right, now let's get our house back!

550
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,680
[all] She did it!

551
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,100
Shiver me timbers,
they're coming this way!

552
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,352
Do something, you Miserable Marla!

553
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:11,815
[Riff barks]

554
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:14,526
[rock music playing]

555
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,613
Ohhhh!

556
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:20,907
Uh, I-I'm sorry,

557
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,326
are ye… rocking out?

558
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,537
[singing]

559
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,414
Oh, uh… sorry.

560
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:32,377
[rock music playing]

561
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,922
Ha ha ha! Rock and roll!

562
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:39,509
[gasps] They're inside the lighthouse!

563
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:40,802
Where are they?

564
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,512
[all] Beam Control!

565
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,932
[beeping]

566
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:47,851
Oh, no. We're locked out!

567
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,894
Not for long!

568
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:54,190
Come on, come on!

569
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,025
Come on…

570
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,277
come on…

571
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,070
[gasps] Yes!

572
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,030
Now let's go down to Beam Control

573
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,783
and show those baddies
who's in control.

574
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,910
Wait a sec, Riff.

575
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,662
You say here and guard my soup.

576
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:08,955
[grunts]

577
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:10,665
[chiming]

578
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,125
Yes!

579
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:15,795
The Glowing Gizmo of Power is fixed.

580
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,464
Ohh!

581
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:18,757
Blimey!

582
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,509
Do we have to do anything
to make it work,

583
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,303
or does it just--?

584
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:24,846
[evil laughter]

585
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,516
Pow, pow, pow!

586
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:34,105
Yarr, har, har, har!

587
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,523
I feel the power.

588
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,735
So… much… power!

589
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,616
[gasps] Jumpin' Geehosofat!

590
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:46,910
What's happening to them?

591
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:50,538
You'll never be able to stop us now,
Beam Team!

592
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,708
[evil laughter]

593
00:29:57,504 --> 00:30:01,382
What just happened?
And where did they go?

594
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,552
-I can't believe they got away.
-For now.

595
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:08,139
The important thing is we're
working together as a team.

596
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,099
Whatever this thing is,

597
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:13,603
I think it gave them those
extra-strong super powers.

598
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:15,522
But where did it come from?

599
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,565
And what are they up to tonight?

600
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,692
I bet we can use the Beam Computer

601
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:22,946
to reprogram this thing
to take those powers away.

602
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:25,573
Boost, I like the way you think.

603
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,909
All right, Beam Team, here's the plan.

604
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:31,454
Boost, you and Gramps stay here
and work on this device

605
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,373
so we can turn those super villains

606
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:35,208
back to normal villains.

607
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:38,419
We'll go try to find them
and figure out what they're planning to do

608
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,963
with their new powers.

609
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:41,756
And stall them long enough

610
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,675
for you to reprogram that device

611
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:45,760
to help us save the day.

612
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:49,055
Hopefully before midnight,

613
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:51,558
because I really want to see
that heart drop.

614
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,518
Beam Team on three!

615
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:58,189
One, two…

616
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,817
Wait! I just remembered something.

617
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,112
You know what to do.

618
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,703
Well, uh, somebody's got to watch my soup.

619
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:16,040
Ava Peyton still coming to you live

620
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,750
from Somerset City Hall,

621
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:21,170
where we are just moments away
from the New Year's countdown.

622
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,757
And what are you looking forward to
this evening?

623
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,134
Um…

624
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,635
the dawning on a new era

625
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:31,014
in which all the villains
are in charge of everything.

626
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,724
[nervous laugh] Okay.

627
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:35,977
Wait a minute. Are we on TV?

628
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,020
[chuckles]

629
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:40,064
Hi, Mom!

630
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,274

[screaming]

633
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:46,863
Aw, come on, friends,

634
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:49,741
this party is just getting started.

635
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:50,658
Aye!

636
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,160
You haven't even smelled
me new

637
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:55,914
super duper
stinky superpowers!

638
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:57,749

[loud rumble]

641
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:10,386
[laughs]

642
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:13,389
Can we make a cool entrance
or what?

643
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:16,059
Yeah, well, so can we.

644
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:18,811
[cheering]

645
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:21,981
Well, well, right on schedule.

646
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,816
It's over, Marla.

647
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,944
You can't beat the Beam Team.

648
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,195
Sorry,

649
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:30,865
but you're gonna have to go through
the Mean Team first.

650
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,367
Yeah!

651
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:35,828
Uh… when is the Mean Team
gonna get here?

652
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:38,539
[groans] We're the Mean Team!

654
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:42,835
-What?
-[crying] I'm sorry,

655
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,837
I-I-I've just never

656
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,507
been on a team before.

657
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,301
Can we just battle the good guys?

658
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,469
Please?!

659
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:53,346
Okay!

660
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,269
[strains]

661
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,525
Ahhh!

662
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:08,611
Ugh! [sighs]

663
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:11,322
Huh? [screams]

664
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:17,787
[grunts]

665
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,372
Hyah!

666
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,582
Huh?

667
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,626
[laughs]

668
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,336

-[guitar chord plays]
-Yeah!

670
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:28,965
Okay,

671
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:31,217
I know we be battling each other
and such,

672
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,802
but can I just say,

673
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:36,222
that be a very cool guitar.

674
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:38,766
Thanks!

675
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,727
-[grunts]
-[evil laughter]

676
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:44,147
This is not how I expected the family
to spend New Year's Eve.

677
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,692
You think Kipper's having
as much fun as we are?

678
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,487

681
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,206
[mystery villain] Excellent.

682
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:05,668
It won't be long now
before Somerset is ours.

683
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,628
All ours!

684
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:11,174

[grunting]

686
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:18,139
Oh! They're too strong for us
with their new superpowers!

687
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,016
We can't give up now.

688
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:22,685
We have to buy Gramps and Boost
some more time.

689
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,062
Whoa!

690
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:25,772
Whoa-oh-oh!

691
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:28,024
-[evil laugh]
-Ahhh!

00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,319
[gasps]

693

[ominous music plays]

694
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,075
What is that?!

695
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,077
That is our leader,

696
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,329
someone who can help us defeat
the Beam Team

697
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,164
once and for all.

698
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,919
Hey, guys, I don't mean to rush you,

699
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:49,921
<i>but these super-duper-powered villains</i>

700
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,172

<i>and oh, by the way,</i>

702
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,301
<i>there's a big spaceship in the sky!</i>

703
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:57,095
We managed to reconfigure the device.

704
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,055
It should take away their superpowers.

705
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:01,265
But it won't work
unless we find something

706
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,892
to replace the crushed crystal.

707
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:04,393
<i>What kind of crystal?</i>

708
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:07,814
We used the Beam Computer
to analyze the broken fragments.

709
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:10,108
It needs to be something clear and solid.

710
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,110
But strong enough to focus the energy.

711
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:15,029
Strong, clear, and solid.

712
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,531
Hmmm.

713
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:17,949
Huh?

714
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,701
What about that?

715
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:21,994
[gasps]

716
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,080
Yarr! Hoo, hoo, hoo!

Yarr!

00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,379

Face it,

you're never gonna be able to stop us.

726
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,232
Time for you do-gooders

727
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:54,110
to step aside once and for all.

728
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,904
It's our turn to rule!
