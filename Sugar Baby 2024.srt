Ready when you are, Ms. King.

00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:19,813
Thank you.

11
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:20,880
I'll be right there.

12
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,423
Students,

13
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,759
we are honored to have our guest speaker with us today.

14
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:35,595
She made waves with her early backing

15
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:38,498
of Generation Coders, a groundbreaking company

16
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:41,167
that empowers children to become AI pioneers.

17
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:44,771
Not only is she an influential investor in the tech industry,

18
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:47,307
she's a visionary leader with a track record

19
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:50,910
of nurturing innovations into global success stories.

20
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:54,781
It is my pleasure to welcome Ms. Veronica King.

[applauding]

Thank you.

23
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:02,589
It inspires me to be here as well.

24
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:06,626
You were the driving force of the next wave of technology.

25

It is important to learn early how to invest in...

26
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:15,268
Nice of you to join us, Mike.

27
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,839
As I was saying,

28
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:21,274
I, uh...

29
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:25,311
it is important to learn early

30
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:28,815
how to invest in low-risk portfolios.

-Good to meet you. -Yeah, nice to meet you, too.

Thank you so much for having me. It was a pleasure.

35
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,802
Ms. King...

36
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:52,138
I feel really bad for interrupting your presentation,

37
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:53,473
so I wanted to say sorry about that.

38
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,241
It's not a problem.

39
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,076
Mike Sheppard.

40
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:58,578
Hi, Mike.

41
00:02:58,645 --> 00:02:59,879
I've been following your career since you invested

42
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:02,582
in this finance app I use, JumpFunder.

43
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,484
Don't tell my friends, but I'm kind of a fan.

44
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,953
[chuckles] I won't tell anyone.

45
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,522
Okay, so, look, I'm actually working on an app myself

46
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,424
to promote healthier lifestyles.

47
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:14,160
Would you by chance be offering any mentorship programs?

48
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:15,862
No, sorry, not at the moment,

49
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,164
but definitely keep going with that idea.

50
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:19,766
It sounds like a game-changer.

51
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:22,435
Well, it was worth a shot. Thanks anyway.

52
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:24,170
Really great presentation too, by the way.

53
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,372
Thank you.

54
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,441
Greg, I can't believe how much he puts me

55
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:30,944
in the mind of Jayson.

56
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,478
It's not necessary looks.

57
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,581
It's his mannerism.

58
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:37,684
[Veronica] He has such a confidence in himself.

59
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,587
You sure putting yourself in that environment is a good idea?

60
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:44,257
It feels good knowing that I'm helping kids Jayson's age.

61
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:45,658
[Greg] Understood.

62
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,928
And you've been handling everything very well.

63
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,396
It's just that I wouldn't want to see you

64
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:52,131
go back into that dark period.

65
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:54,300
[Greg] I wouldn't mention it if I didn't care about you.

66
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,803
I know. Come by later?

67
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,004
You got it.

68
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,475
Ooh.

69
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,778
Here we go. [gasps] There's something on your face.

70
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,350
[sighs] Bye.

71
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,484
Excuse me.

72
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:13,720
Oh, you're Veronica King.

73
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:16,222
I watched your interview last week on TEDtime Live.

74
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:17,724
Thank you.

75
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,159
I couldn't help but notice your companion.

76
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:22,228
Babies. [chuckles]

77
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,330
No sense in being shy about the truth.

78
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:26,366
When it comes to my age, you stop worrying about

79
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,168
what people think and focus on being happy.

80
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:34,173
And those two... [sighs] make mama very happy. [chuckles]

81
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,541
You're dating both of them.

82
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:36,876
Oh, no, I ditched that.

83
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,511
I thought I was looking for love,

84
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:40,980
but really, I just wanted companionship.

85
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:43,216
So now I focus on the sugar baby apps.

86
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:47,353
It's kind of like a "pay-to-play" relationship.

87
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,356
Like picking from a menu.

88
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:52,792
-What's the name of the app? -[chuckles]

89
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,628
[Andrew] Uh, yes, I was just checking in

90
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:58,364
to make sure we were still good for 1:00.

91
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,099
-Sugar Finders. -Yes.

92
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,235
-Uh. -What?

93
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,903
This app. Have you heard of it?

94
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,506
Well, a little too young to be a sugar daddy.

95
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,876
So, it's for older people?

96
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:11,411
Yeah, specifically,

97
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:15,915
one looking for the company of a much younger persuasion.

98
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,784
You know, you pay them for their time,

99
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:21,387
attention, affection, sex, whatever you need.

100
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:23,556
You interested in that?

101
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,958
What in the world would I do with a sugar baby? No.

102
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:29,862
I think it would be a potential investment opportunity.

103
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:31,097
Just business.

104
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,865
My shero.

105
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:36,102
All business, all the time. [chuckles]

106
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,337
Just don't forget about me

107
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:38,371
when you're handing out promotions.

108
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:39,739
Of course.

109
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,741
Run some reports for me on this app.

110
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:44,510
If it's that popular, I think it could be worth looking into.

Beverly, I'm glad you're here.

116
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:06,632
I missed you.

117
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,201
I'm gonna cut right to the chase.

118
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:09,369
What's up?

119
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:11,537
It's clear that your personal life

120
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:12,805
has become a distraction

121
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,207
from your responsibilities to me.

122
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:16,042
I'm trying the best I can.

123
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:18,010
I'm juggling you, school, and everything.

124
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:22,048
Oh, and I wish you well with your... education,

125
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,883
but I'm terminating this agreement.

126
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,586
Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

127
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:28,988
You're right, okay?

128
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,758
Let me make it up to you. What I gotta do?

129
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:36,028
[chuckles] Nothing my new sugar baby can't handle, dear.

130
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:39,365
Wait, what about the rest of my money?

131
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,067
You still owe me eight grand.

132
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:45,405
You get paid for our service when you complete the service.

133
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:46,706
Our business has concluded,

134
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,908
and I don't owe you another penny.

135
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,112
Good luck, Mike.

136
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:58,851
[exhales]

137
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:01,020
[Gia] Do you think she figured out

138
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,688
we were dating and not roommates?

139
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,056
[Mike] I doubt it.

140
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,559
Beverly was too damn clingy anyway.

141
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,227
Forget her, I'll find somebody else.

142
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:10,596
Babe, we needed that income.

143
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:12,165
We have tuition due in two weeks.

144
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:13,366
I know, I know.

145
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,234
-Do you think I need to-- -No.

146
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:17,270
We agreed that I would do these arrangements,

147
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:19,172
so you won't be involved in anything dangerous.

148
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:22,208
Look, maybe I can pick up a few more hours tutoring.

149
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,810
I want to help you, okay?

150
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:25,511
I don't want this to be too much on you.

151
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:27,947
Babe, I got it, all right?

152
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,515
I'll make sure I do what I gotta do

153
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:31,217
to take care of us, I promise.

154
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:33,820
You want a slice of cheesecake

155
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,588
from that bakery you like on campus?

156

-Good evening. -[creaks]

00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:55,374
like you asked.

163

I'm on call tonight, so I gotta head out.

167
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:05,685
You promise you call me if you need anything?

168
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:07,954
Of course, as I always do.

169
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,121
Mm-hmm.

170
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:14,260
Have a good night, Andrew.

171
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,233
Okay, let me see what you have.

172
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:27,406
[Andrew] You and Greg seem pretty close.

173
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:31,777
Greg is and always will be my best friend, that's it.

174
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,013
I just mean it's nice to see

175
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,748
a man putting a smile on your face.

176
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:37,517
Even though everything happened with your husband

177
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,252
before I came around,

178
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:41,120
I've seen the toll it's taken on you.

179
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,660
What'd you find out about the app?

180
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:49,529
Numbers look promising.

181
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:51,063
In the first year,

182
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,099
they're anticipating to generate five million in revenue

183
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,535
with a gross profit margin of 75%.

184
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:59,005
Their user acquisition is aggressive,

185
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:02,008
but we have to trust market research.

186
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:05,077
Very true, especially with a startup so new.

187
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:08,381
It would be ideal if we could locate one of their users,

188
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:11,350
you know, maybe talk to them, get some first-hand knowledge.

189
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,221
-What are you doing? -A field test.

190
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:18,758
I need to find out for myself how this thing works.

191
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:21,060
Simplistic interface,

192
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:23,095
-visually appealing... -Yep.

193
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:28,200
...organized, unique scheduling features...

194
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:30,303
in-app messaging.

195
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,239
I'm curious if--

196
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,277
What, what's wrong?

197
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,246
Nothing. I was just saying

198
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:43,316
I'm curious if they have high subscription retention.

199
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,253
Find out if we can set up a meeting

200
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,588
with the app executives.

Babe, look at this. Come here.

204
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:14,747
Look.

205
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:17,216
Veronica King? Since when is she a sugar mama?

206
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,051
I don't know, but this could be our answer.

207
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,753
-Mm -This could set us up

208
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,989
to where I don't even have to do this no more.

209
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:24,056
You think she'll be interested?

210
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,425
Trust me, I'll make sure she is.

211
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:27,827
I'll do whatever she says

212
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,362
and give her all the attention she needs.

213
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:32,398
This one gonna take care of us just like I promised.

He was a Real Rabbit at last,

218
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:53,452
and at home with the other rabbits."

219
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:00,793
I love you, my sunshine.

220
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:03,863
Good night.

[dramatic music]

223
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:32,525
[Sharon] How has it been since our last session, Veronica?

224
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:35,294
The grief comes in waves.

225
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,362
Sometimes it's so heavy

226
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:39,231
I don't know how I'll get out of bed.

227
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,000
[Sharon] You have to be gentle with yourself.

228
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,169
I know I've been saying that ten years is a long time,

229
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:45,071
but it doesn't really seem like that

230
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:48,541
when you're trying to survive living without your husband.

231
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,677
How's your son coping with the death of his father?

232
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:53,813
-Is he still traveling? -Yeah.

233
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,082
It's hard for him, too.

234
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:57,817
Have you spoken with him lately?

235
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:01,454
Yes. He's on one of those alphabet trips.

236
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,656
A location for each letter.

237
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,225
I think he's in Dubai now.

238
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:07,460
Egypt is next.

239
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,130
And how is he feeling?

240
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:14,433
Not too good.

241
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,436
I just want to protect him.

242
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:20,840
Do you have kids, Sharon?

243
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:24,376
[chuckles] Ah, I do. Two little girls.

244
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:28,013
So I know exactly what you mean by wanting to protect your son.

245
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:32,518
A mother's unconditional love is a powerful thing.

246
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,854
Do you ever feel like you're not a good mother?

247
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,989
[Sharon] Yes.

248
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:39,925
And those feelings are completely normal.

249
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,063
Any setbacks are valuable life lessons

250
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:47,233
that could lead to development and resilience.

251
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:50,035
They're opportunities for growth.

252
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:53,339
And you learn a lot more about yourself in the end.

253
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,619
You know, it was good to see your profile on the app.

254
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,854
I didn't know you were into this kind of lifestyle.

255
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,289
I'm not actually.

256
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,258
I'm looking to invest in Sugar Finders.

257
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:14,827
So I was just doing some research.

258
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,428
Wait, so you're not interested

259
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:18,297
in an arrangement with a sugar baby?

260
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:21,400
So why did you agree to me?

261
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,636
[Veronica] We might as well talk about it, Mike.

262
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:25,638
Especially since you mentioned an interest

263
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:27,139
in a mentorship anyway.

264
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:34,580
We'll both have a glass of Chateau D'Anielle

265
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,216
and oysters topped with caviar.

266
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:41,487
Wow. You have nice taste.

267
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,355
I like to think so.

268
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:48,260
So tell me how you found your way on Sugar Finders.

269
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,728
Well, honestly, I need to do this

270
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:51,197
to finance my education.

271
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:52,965
And I also want to start up my own tech business

272
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:54,300
after college, so...

273
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:55,768
Ambition.

274
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,503
Admirable.

275
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:01,707
Do your parents agree with your job?

276
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:04,610
My mom left me and my dad when I was about five years old.

277
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,812
And I don't have any brothers or sisters, so...

278
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,215
I'm sorry about that.

279
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:11,650
-Are you and your dad close? -Not really.

280
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:15,087
He was a military guy, so he was kind of a hard-ass.

281
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,356
I never really got much love from him.

282
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:20,059
We don't talk much, so I pretty much do everything in my own.

283
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:21,894
How about you?

284
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:24,864
Not much to tell. I'm a widow.

285
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:29,668
I have one son who's about your age.

286
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:34,139
He's my world. So, Mike, how does this work?

287
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,208
This is all new to me.

288
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,576
Okay, so, basically,

289
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:39,411
you would pay me to do whatever it is

290
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:40,746
you need me to do.

291
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:44,917
-And if you ever get lonely or-- -No, nothing like that.

292
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:47,786
I'm not looking for companionship.

293
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:49,588
Let's just be clear.

294
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,023
That's fine.

295
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,658
So what exactly are you looking for?

296
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:56,328
I told you I'm looking to invest in Sugar Finders.

297
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,198
I was thinking you can act like my field test.

298
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:03,836
Helping me to delve further into the app's operations.

299
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,704
Yeah, that's easy.

300
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:08,841
You could also accompany me to tech events,

301
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,576
to network and connect.

302
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:13,846
You could provide me feedback about your experiences

303
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,082
and further influence my decision.

304
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:19,084
Okay, now that, kind of, sounds like companionship,

305
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:21,954
-wouldn't you say? -Absolutely not.

306
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:24,790
This is strictly business, understand?

307
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,058
Whatever you say.

308
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,094
So when do we start?

309
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,563
What's your fee?

310
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,766
Ten thousand for three months and I'm all yours.

311
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:36,135
Ten thousand?

312
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:37,870
I thought it was going to be much more than that,

313
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,038
to be honest.

314

One more thing.

316
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,882
I'm paying you for your accessibility.

317
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,184
I want to be sure you're focused.

318
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:55,554
Do you have any distractions, relationships,

319
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:59,258
other sugar mamas or anything that might interfere?

320
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:03,696
If so, tell me now. Before I waste my time.

321
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,198
Not at all.

322
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:09,101
I'm focused and ready.

I didn't wake you, did I?

327
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:31,623
No, I'm up. What's good?

328
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,360
I have a tech fundraising event to attend this weekend

329
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:37,363
and I think it's a good idea if you come with me.

330
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,198
[Mike] For sure. Yeah, sounds fun.

331
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:40,432

00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:22,654
Jayson always said he wanted to be a pilot.

498
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:26,291
But life had other plans for him.

499
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:29,327
And then his dad.

500
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,832
I'm sorry for your loss, Veronica.

501
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:48,413
Everybody's staring.

502
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,981
That's because they like you.

503
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,183
No, I mean staring at us.

504
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,521
Aren't you used to this?

505
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:58,123
You've done this before, right?

506
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:02,060
I was thinking...

507
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:05,764
Do you mind coming back to spend the night with me?

508
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,900
Things get lonely in that big house by myself.

509
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:11,603
I'll pay extra.

510
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:16,441
Uh... Yeah, yeah, sure.

511
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:18,276
One sec.

512
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:19,511
I have a quick call to make.

513
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:20,779
Okay.

514

[door creaks]

518
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:56,041
Welcome to your new room.

519
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:58,276
Let me draw you a bath. Do you like bubbles?

520
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,944
I don't need a bath.

521
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,380
It'll relax you. Help you sleep better.

522
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:03,648
I have basketball shorts

523
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:05,183
and a T-shirt for you to sleep in.

524
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,018
Unless you prefer something different.

525
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:08,820
Nah, it's fine. Listen, Veronica,

526
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:11,022
I just want to thank you again for everything.

527
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:15,126
It means a lot to me to have you around.

What the hell are you thinking, Jayson?

530
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,233
-It's Mike. -This is not what we agreed to.

531
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,302
-Is it what Beverly had you do? -My bad.

532
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,237
I thought that's why you wanted me to stay the night.

533
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:27,872
You thought wrong.

534
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:30,008
Don't ever disrespect me like that again.

Shit, Veronica.

558
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:19,077
You scared me. What are you doing here?

559
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:20,445
I couldn't sleep.

560
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:23,448
I-I'm not used to having people in the house.

561
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:25,884
I wanted to apologize about earlier.

562
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,352
I didn't mean to snap at you.

563
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:30,121
I-- and I certainly had no business in hitting you.

564
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:31,923
I was just shocked.

565
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,958
Hey, it's cool.

566
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:35,393
I'm the one that should apologize

567
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,928
because I'm the one that crossed the line.

568
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:38,930
I'd never disrespect you.

569
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:40,531
I know.

570
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:42,233
And from here on out,

571
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,602
I swear I won't do anything that you don't want me to do.

572
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:49,374
I'm grateful for you, Mikey. Truly.

573
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:53,344
Let me tuck you in.

574
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,556
What bedtime story

575
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:07,125
would you like me to read you tonight?

00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,194
I'm good. Thanks.

Is everything okay?

00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:45,697
Of course.

582
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:47,065
It just helps me to relax

583
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,733
to know that you're getting some sleep.

[exhales softly]

00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,755
Good morning, sleepyhead. How'd you sleep?

589
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:44,789
Fine.

590
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:52,363
Mikey, this is my dear friend, Greg.

591
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,198
Greg, this is the young man I've been telling you about.

592
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:56,134
Veronica's been telling me

593
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,202
that you've been studying computer science?

594
00:33:58,269 --> 00:33:59,871
Mikey wants to start his tech business

595
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:01,105
after graduation.

596
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:02,640
He created an app

597
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:05,910
that provides personalized health recommendations.

598
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:07,311
Mm. Sounds interesting.

00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,247
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

Uh, I didn't know what you'd like,

601
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:15,353
so I just made a little bit of everything.

602
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,523
Well, actually, I have that dairy allergy, remember?

603
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:22,660
Juice, then.

604
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,429
You know what, look, don't even worry about it.

605
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:26,030
I actually have to get going.

606
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:28,199
No, not until you eat everything.

607
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:31,302
I mean...

608

eat while I call you a car.

609
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:37,809
Okay.

610
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,513
Don't mind Roni.

611
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,915
It's not very often she has company.

612
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:47,885
I find it easier just to let her do her thing.

[scoffs]

614
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:50,822
How long have you known her?

615
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:53,791
About 20 years or so.

616
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:56,027
She invested in my online pharmaceutical company

617
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:59,931
back in the day when I was just a resident doctor with a dream.

618
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:01,532
Been friends ever since.

619
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,068
I like to think that I owe everything to Roni

620
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:05,870
for just believing in me.

621
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,138
Look, forgive me for asking,

622
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:11,175
but are you two, like-like, a thing?

623
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:13,144
It's complicated.

624
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:14,378
At the end of the day,

625
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,414
I like to think that we're best friends.

626
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:20,151
I see that you're not unfamiliar with complicated relationships.

What exactly is a sugar baby?

628
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:26,557
I get hired as a companion to do whatever they need me to do.

629
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:30,194
Well, oh, sort of like a male prostitute, basically.

630
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:32,230
Actually, it's a little bit more than that.

[chuckles]

632

Hey, no judgment.

I'm not here to interfere with whatever

634
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:41,205
you and Veronica got going on.

635
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:42,773
Just don't play with her emotions.

636
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,575
Understand?

637
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:47,512
Greg, you feel threatened by me or something?

638
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:49,080
Like I said, we're just friends.

639
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:52,583
And I care very much about her health and well-being.

640
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:56,220
And unlike you my care for her isn't tied to her bank account.

641
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:58,322
[groans]

642
00:35:58,389 --> 00:35:59,690
You better take care of that.

643
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:01,459
What happened? Are you hurt?

644
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:03,294
It's all right. He just cut his finger.

645
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:04,929
Put some direct pressure on that.

646
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,998
I have an emergency kit in the guest bathroom.

647
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:08,232
Yo, go ahead.

648
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:09,800
I'm gonna stay here and clean up.

649
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:23,414
-There we go. All better. -Thanks.

650
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:25,750
My driver just had a few errands to run for me,

651
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:27,552
but he'll be back in a few minutes.

652
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,388
Thank you for staying.

653
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:33,457
You know you can come over whenever you want.

654
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,727
My home is your home.

655
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:38,429
Okay.

656
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:40,865
Veronica, it was just us here last night, right?

657
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:42,800
Yeah, why?

658
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,335
I don't know. Um...

659
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:46,737
I thought I heard something in the basement.

660
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:48,172
Oh...

661
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:51,409
Lord, I hope we don't have raccoons like the time before.

662
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:53,277
I'll have to get Greg to check it out.

663
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:54,478
Okay.

664
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,013

I texted you to let you know what was going on.

Staying the night at Veronica's? Are you crazy?

That was not a part of the plan.

So nothing happened?

Just some weird stuff.

686
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,340
She kept trying to do everything for me

Doesn't she have a son?

Why is she treating you like hers?

690
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:35,079
I guess she misses him.

But, hey, if she gets off on pretending to be my mom,

697

I don't care.

Especially because she pays extra.

Do you have feelings for this young man?

Obviously, he is physically attractive,

I want you to consider this relationship with Mike

is an opportunity for me to network,

[phone rings]

834
00:45:20,951 --> 00:45:22,586
What's up, Veronica?

835
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:24,822
[Veronica] I couldn't leave us on such a sour note.

836
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,123
Can we talk?

837
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:30,094
Maybe later. I got 11:00 a.m. class.

838
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,162
[Veronica] I have something for you here at the house.

839
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:34,064
Can I send a car to come get you?

840
00:45:34,131 --> 00:45:35,866
And afterwards, if you never want to see me again,

841
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:37,434
I'll understand.

842
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:40,270
Just please, let me make it up to you.

843
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,542
[sighs]

844
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,313
All right. I'll be ready in 30 minutes.

845
00:45:58,288 --> 00:45:59,823
We have an exam this morning.

846
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:01,325
It'll just be a minute, I promise.

847
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:03,260
Then I'll have Veronica drop me off on campus.

848
00:46:03,327 --> 00:46:06,230
-Mike... -Gia, relax, all right?

849
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:07,865
I already got Veronica hounding me.

850
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:09,733
I don't need you to do it, too.

851
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,336
[suspenseful music]

852
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,455
Thank you for coming.

853
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:33,423
Listen, we gotta talk about everything that's been going on.

854
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:34,992
And we will, I promise.

855
00:46:35,058 --> 00:46:37,194
Just let me show you this first.

856
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:49,840
-What is this? -Yours.

857
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:52,843
-For real? -Oh, what?

858
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:56,079
Oh, my gosh.

859
00:46:57,781 --> 00:47:00,150
I thought you'd like that.

860
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:01,852
Something that reminds you of your dad.

861
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:03,353
Thank you, Veronica.

862
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:08,292
This means so much to me.

863
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:10,594
Wanna take it for a spin?

864
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:15,332
I don't know. My class starts soon.

865
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:17,935
[joyful music]

866
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,072
All right, just a little bit. [chuckles]

867
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:24,074
-See you later, okay? -See you later.

868
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:26,243
Gia?

869
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:29,546
Do I know you?

870
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:32,983
No, no, I'm-I'm-I'm Nora.

871
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:35,385
I follow Veronica King online.

872
00:47:36,553 --> 00:47:38,856
I saw she posted a picture of a speech

873
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:40,891
she gave to your computer science class.

874
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:42,860
You were tagged in it.

875
00:47:42,926 --> 00:47:44,328
Oh, okay.

876
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:49,299
Is there somewhere we can go and talk?

877
00:47:50,968 --> 00:47:52,035
I think you might be in danger.

878
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:54,638
[tense music]

879
00:47:57,007 --> 00:47:59,243
I've been following Veronica for years,

880
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:02,279
and I saw she was out with this guy Mike.

881
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:05,816
Then I saw you and Mike together, so...

882
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:07,451
So I knew I had to say something.

883
00:48:07,517 --> 00:48:09,253
I couldn't let another woman end up like my sister.

884
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:12,155
Wait, why were you stalking Veronica?

885
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,624
And what do you mean end up like your sister?

886
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:15,926
I've been watching her for something

887
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:17,628
that I can use against her.

888
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:20,163
I can't prove it,

889
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,431
but I think Veronica had something to do

890
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:23,834
-with my sister's death. -What?

891
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,335
About ten years ago,

892
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:28,939
my sister Carla worked with Veronica's husband Richie.

893
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:30,374
She was his publicist.

894
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:34,811
One night they died in a car crash.

895
00:48:34,878 --> 00:48:37,981
What made you think Veronica had something to do with it?

896
00:48:38,048 --> 00:48:40,951
Carla told me that she and Richie...

897
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:43,253
had an affair.

898
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,188
Supposedly, it was a one-time thing,

899
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:47,224
but Carla had a crush on him,

900
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:49,726
and they spent a lot of time together.

901
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:51,361
And apparently,

902
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,597
it was something that Richie and Veronica argued about

903
00:48:53,664 --> 00:48:55,032
all the time.

904
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:58,001
So you think Veronica found out something about them that day?

905
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:00,304
Like I said, I can't prove it.

906
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:02,306
And the police haven't been any help.

907
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:03,974
They just labeled it as a car crash.

908
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:06,510
But if I'm right,

909
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:08,378
and Veronica finds out that Mike is cheating with you,

910
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:11,248
-she may snap. -He's not cheating.

911
00:49:11,315 --> 00:49:12,282
I know.

912
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:17,154
But, this is a lot to digest.

913
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:21,358
I tried to warn my sister to back off of Richie.

914
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:23,193
I couldn't protect Carla,

915
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,762
so the least I can do is just try to protect you.

916
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:29,132
There is no telling what Veronica is capable of.

917
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:31,735
[music continues]

918
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:43,146
Nora...

919
00:49:46,717 --> 00:49:47,718
Hmm?

00:49:51,955 --> 00:49:53,357
[screams]

921
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:58,495
[sighs] Come on, pick up.

922
00:49:58,562 --> 00:50:02,532
[Mike] You've reached Mike. Drop a message or hit me later.

923
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:04,101
Babe.

924
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,502
Babe, where are you?

925
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:08,372
Call me back. Please, I'm worried.

926

-[thuds] -[sobs]

930
00:51:45,068 --> 00:51:47,404
I'm impressed. This looks good.

931
00:51:47,471 --> 00:51:50,173
If it tastes the same... I haven't made this in years,

932
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,842
so it might be a little rusty.

933
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:53,176
All right, let's see.

934
00:51:56,012 --> 00:51:58,682
Mmm. All right, I see you.

935
00:51:58,748 --> 00:52:00,517
[both laugh]

936
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:02,085
-Great news. -Yeah?

937
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:03,553
I have a business meeting

938
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,856
with the executive of Sugar Finders tomorrow.

939
00:52:05,922 --> 00:52:07,524
So I want you to come with me,

940
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:10,961
since you've been instrumental in my decision to invest.

941
00:52:11,027 --> 00:52:12,429
That's a smart move.

942
00:52:12,496 --> 00:52:14,197
You're gonna make a lot of money with this app.

943
00:52:14,264 --> 00:52:16,199
It's only at the beginning.

944
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:19,836
I see you as the future of my investments.

945
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:23,540
So I want to make sure we have a plan in place

946
00:52:23,607 --> 00:52:25,876
for you to get the experience,

947
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:29,179
especially for your own app.

948
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:31,781
That's one of the reasons why

949
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:36,319
I reached back out to Bernard Klein.

950
00:52:36,386 --> 00:52:39,990
I told him you were interested in the internship.

951
00:52:40,056 --> 00:52:41,491
Yes!

952
00:52:41,558 --> 00:52:42,926
Thank you, Veronica.

953
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,594
It's the least I could do,

954
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:46,863
especially since I messed everything up the first time.

955
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:48,398
[phone chimes]

956
00:52:54,137 --> 00:52:55,372
Something wrong?

957
00:52:58,074 --> 00:52:59,376
Listen, Veronica,

958
00:52:59,442 --> 00:53:02,179
I gotta be completely honest with you.

959
00:53:02,245 --> 00:53:04,614
The girl I was with the other day, Gia?

960
00:53:06,616 --> 00:53:08,552
[sighs] She's my girlfriend.

961
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:11,655
You lied to me.

962
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:13,290
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

963
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:15,625
You're sorry? You think that makes it better?

964
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,761
Well, you said this wasn't a romantic thing anyway,

965
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:19,162
so why are you so upset?

966
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:21,798
It's not a romantic thing. I wanted all of your time.

967
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,333
Isn't that what I'm paying you for?

968
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,702
Okay. You're right.

969
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:28,438
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that.

970
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:30,574
But it's not like it matters anymore anyway.

971
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:34,644
She just broke up with me.

972
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:36,313
Apparently, she's been trying to reach me all day

973
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:37,914
and now she's pissed.

974
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:40,417
She kicked me out.

975
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:47,924
Move in with me.

976
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:49,492
I have plenty of rooms.

977
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:53,463
In fact, last surprise.

978
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:55,532
I promise. Close your eyes.

979
00:53:58,001 --> 00:53:59,469
What is it this time?

980
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:03,573
Okay, open up.

981
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:06,243
Don't you just love it?

982
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:07,544
Uh...

983
00:54:11,214 --> 00:54:12,382
Wow.

984
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:16,820
Yeah.

985
00:54:16,886 --> 00:54:19,422
[suspenseful music]

986
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,736
With your investments,

987
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:34,904
we intend to expand our marketing efforts

988
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:37,340
and hire a few different developers

989
00:54:37,407 --> 00:54:39,943
to increase the platform's functionality.

990
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:41,544
I love that.

991
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:44,514
I'm interested in contributing beyond just capital.

992
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:48,685
I see Sugar Finders as the pay-to-play relations app

993
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:50,220
that will dominate this market.

994
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:51,821
Yeah, I totally agree.

995
00:54:51,888 --> 00:54:53,790
-Cheers. -Cheers.

00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:01,765
Well, Mr. Sheppard,

998
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:04,034
looks like we have you to thank for onboarding Miss King

999
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,635
and showing her

1000
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:07,837
what a valuable asset she could be to our operation.

1001
00:55:07,904 --> 00:55:10,006
Yes, sir. I'm just glad it worked out.

1002
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,977
I think that you will get a promising mogul

1003
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:15,945
-on your hands here. -[chuckles]

1004
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:20,183
I couldn't imagine doing it without him.

1005
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,351
If you two will excuse me.

[Gia] Hey, it's Gia. Leave a message, or don't.

1009
00:55:42,572 --> 00:55:45,208
Babe, please call me back.

1010
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:47,610
Look, I'm sorry I didn't realize you tried to reach me yesterday,

1011
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:49,946
but I should have communicated better.

1012
00:55:50,947 --> 00:55:53,116
Look, I was wrong.

1013
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,552
Just hear me out. I promise to do better.

1014
00:55:55,618 --> 00:55:56,853
I love you.

1015
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:05,095
I see you're still hanging around.

1016
00:56:05,161 --> 00:56:06,496
Yo, what's your problem, Andrew?

1017
00:56:06,563 --> 00:56:08,798
You. Stealing my spot with Veronica?

1018
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:10,367
Ever since you came around,

1019
00:56:10,433 --> 00:56:11,835
she's just been pushing me to the side.

1020
00:56:11,901 --> 00:56:13,570
Veronica and I have a business arrangement.

1021
00:56:13,636 --> 00:56:15,438
That's it. I ain't coming for your spot.

1022
00:56:15,505 --> 00:56:16,506
Bullshit.

1023
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:18,007
Until you came into the picture,

1024
00:56:18,074 --> 00:56:19,976
all of Veronica's business was with me.

1025
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,578
All right, well, I can't help you with that.

1026
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:22,946
That's between you and her.

All right, get up. Damn! Hey!

1032
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:01,885
How is he?

1033
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,620
He'll be fine.

1034
00:57:03,686 --> 00:57:05,522
Tests came back normal.

Why'd you have to draw blood?

1036
00:57:08,158 --> 00:57:10,126
Standard procedure.

1037
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:13,797
We check for internal injuries, infection,

1038
00:57:13,863 --> 00:57:16,166
and your blood alcohol level.

1039
00:57:16,232 --> 00:57:18,835
In case Andrew tries to say that you initiated the attack

1040
00:57:18,902 --> 00:57:21,371
because you were under the influence.

1041
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,239
I'm so glad you're okay.

00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:40,690
It's about Gia. She was attacked last night.

-Gia? -Mike, thank God.

Someone attacked me on campus last night.

Babe, I'm so sorry.

1054
00:58:14,357 --> 00:58:15,959
I should have been there.

1055
00:58:16,025 --> 00:58:18,761
I've been trying to call you ever since I got your text.

1056
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:24,934
What text?

You said...

Look, it doesn't matter.

1059
00:58:28,204 --> 00:58:30,640
How you feeling? Can I get you anything?

1060
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:32,208
How long do you have to be here for?

Of course. My goodness.

But what happened? Are you okay?

I'm fine.

-You think it was Andrew? -Probably.

I didn't think he would come after people I care about.

1074

Wait a minute. Who was Andrew?

1075
00:59:12,749 --> 00:59:14,317
And why would he attack me?

1076
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:16,753
He's my ex-assistant.

1077

Gia, I am sorry. This is all my fault.

I'll make sure to cover all of your medical bills.

Okay? She's dangerous.

She said she would pay for your medical bills.

Yesterday, a woman, Nora,

1088

she came on campus looking for me.

She thinks Veronica has something to do

with killing her sister.

Okay? A car accident.

1093
00:59:59,362 --> 01:00:01,831
Veronica's husband was killed, and Nora said that...

1094
01:00:01,898 --> 01:00:05,001
The nurses' station said that visiting hours are over.

-No. He has to stay. -Nurse!

-No, babe, listen to me. -Relax, calm down.

You're in danger now. Get your hands off me.

I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

Please don't leave, Mike. Mike, Mike, please.

Mikey. No!

01:00:55,051 --> 01:00:57,286
She's gonna be okay.

1115
01:00:57,353 --> 01:00:59,689
I just hated to leave her in that condition.

1116
01:00:59,756 --> 01:01:04,160
I'll call Greg personally. Make sure he checks in on her.

1117

We can go right in the morning when you wake up, okay?

Okay.

1119
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:16,205
Gia mentioned something about your husband Richie.

1120
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:20,743
If you don't mind me asking, how did he die?

1121
01:01:22,645 --> 01:01:25,114
It was a traumatic accident.

1122

It still hurts to talk about.

My poor Jayson.

I don't think he ever got over it.

1125

I'm sorry to hear that.

1126

And that's a lot to deal with.

1127

When my mom left,

1128
01:01:40,329 --> 01:01:41,964
I used to sneak and look at old pictures

1129
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:44,767
because I knew my dad wouldn't want to talk about her.

1130
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:46,936
Do you have any recent pictures of Jayson?

1131
01:01:56,012 --> 01:01:57,480
I don't have any pictures,

1132
01:01:58,681 --> 01:02:00,850
but I do have postcards.

[Mike] How the hell did you get my number?

From Veronica's things. Listen, I don't have much time.

-I need your help. -So you attack me and my girl

1147
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:24,400
and you think I'm gonna help you?

Please tell Veronica to drop the assault charges.

I was doing what she told me to,

but she didn't say nothing about jail.

What did she tell you to do?

1154

[Andrew] To fight you.

Why would she tell you to do that?

1156

No big deal.

Denied everything, even when she confronted him.

What happened after that, I'm not entirely sure about.

But one thing I do know,

1327
01:15:35,297 --> 01:15:38,333
you don't want to cross Veronica.

1328

If your mother asks,

just tell her I had a meeting, son.

Your mom will be back in a couple hours.

Look, just let him come, babe.

You don't want him to suspect anything.

Right.

Yes, very. My son's been traveling for a while,

[Greg] I confirmed Mike's blood type is O-negative.

1487
01:29:07,575 --> 01:29:08,876
But I'll need to run a few more tests

1488
01:29:08,943 --> 01:29:11,045
to make sure he's suitable.

1489
01:29:11,112 --> 01:29:13,081
Can you find a way to get him to the hospital?

1490
01:29:15,817 --> 01:29:17,785
I need you to do me a favor.

1491
01:29:22,523 --> 01:29:24,659
[Greg] He's a perfect match.

1492
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:34,602
I'm sorry, Mike.

1493
01:29:34,669 --> 01:29:37,572
But when I found out you could save my son's life,

1494
01:29:37,638 --> 01:29:40,241
I did what I needed to do.

1495
01:29:40,308 --> 01:29:42,543
I'm a mother,

1496
01:29:42,610 --> 01:29:44,078
and I told you,

1497
01:29:44,145 --> 01:29:47,382
a mother will do anything to be with her child.

1498
01:29:47,448 --> 01:29:49,751
[sobs]

1499
01:29:52,787 --> 01:29:55,523
[breathing heavily]

1500
01:30:00,027 --> 01:30:02,930
Wait, wait, no, wait, please, wait!

1501
01:30:04,465 --> 01:30:07,001
[muffled groaning]

1502
01:30:28,122 --> 01:30:29,757
[Sharon] It's been a little minute.

1503
01:30:29,824 --> 01:30:33,494
[Veronica] I know, but things have been going so well.

1504
01:30:33,561 --> 01:30:37,432
And I can't thank you enough for your advice.

1505
01:30:37,498 --> 01:30:39,167
You helped me realize

1506
01:30:39,233 --> 01:30:42,503
what I needed to do to get back to myself.

1507
01:30:42,570 --> 01:30:44,939
Well, you are an amazing woman, Veronica.

1508
01:30:45,006 --> 01:30:46,641
People are lucky to know you.

1509
01:30:46,707 --> 01:30:49,043
No, I'm the lucky one.

1510
01:30:55,016 --> 01:30:56,117
Sorry, mama.

1511
01:30:56,184 --> 01:30:57,618
Am I late?

1512
01:30:57,685 --> 01:30:59,854
Not at all, my sunshine.

1513
01:31:02,690 --> 01:31:04,992
Well, you must be Jayson.

1514
01:31:05,059 --> 01:31:07,428
Your mother has spoken so highly of you,

1515
01:31:07,495 --> 01:31:09,397
I feel like I already know you.

1516
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:10,965
It's nice to finally meet you.

1517
01:31:11,032 --> 01:31:12,133
You, too.

1518
01:31:13,534 --> 01:31:14,735
[Sharon] Well, I won't keep you.

1519
01:31:14,802 --> 01:31:16,237
I know you have a plane to catch.

1520
01:31:16,304 --> 01:31:20,274
So you two have fun and safe time in Aruba.

1521
01:31:20,341 --> 01:31:23,110
Oh, and get a slice of Kesio for me, please.

1522
01:31:23,177 --> 01:31:25,179
[Veronica] Oh, no, Jayson can't have that.

1523
01:31:25,246 --> 01:31:28,049
Dairy products don't really agree with him,

1524
01:31:28,115 --> 01:31:31,686
but we'll certainly enjoy the food, that's for sure.

1525
01:31:34,021 --> 01:31:36,757
I've been praying for this moment with you.

1526
01:31:38,526 --> 01:31:41,028
