3
00:01:02,779 --> 00:01:09,979
Marie. Marie. Are you ok?

4
00:01:12,379 --> 00:01:15,379
Tell me again.

5
00:01:16,146 --> 00:01:19,246
My driver will hear.

6
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:22,146
Tell me in French.

7
00:01:31,179 --> 00:01:33,313
If we are ever separated,

8
00:01:33,346 --> 00:01:34,545
no war,

9
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:36,579
no injury,

10
00:01:36,612 --> 00:01:40,413
no challenge will be enough,

11
00:01:40,445 --> 00:01:42,112
you see,

12
00:01:42,146 --> 00:01:45,046
I know that you are waiting for
me.

13
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:47,379
I will find you,

14
00:01:47,413 --> 00:01:49,413
and I will love you.

15
00:01:51,313 --> 00:01:53,645
Love is stronger than death.

16
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:55,012
You believe so?

17
00:01:55,046 --> 00:01:58,479
Oh I know so.

18
00:01:58,512 --> 00:02:00,146
We will miss you.

19
00:02:00,179 --> 00:02:02,046
We?

20
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,079
Promise to return to us soon.

21
00:02:29,246 --> 00:02:31,179
Take it slowly, the road is
terrible

22
00:02:31,213 --> 00:02:33,712
and we're not in a hurry.

23
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:35,545
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:37,579
It's ok.

25
00:02:50,112 --> 00:02:53,445
Colonel Von bruckner, there's
something in the road.

26
00:03:20,213 --> 00:03:20,847
Wait here.

27
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,979
No, no, no don't leave me.

28
00:03:38,345 --> 00:03:40,645
Don't shoot, I'm French!

29
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,179
You're the German's whore.

30
00:03:43,213 --> 00:03:45,213
I'm innocent, I'm one of you.

31
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:53,512
This is no joke.

32
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,279
Look at this!

33
00:04:01,312 --> 00:04:02,746
No, please don't shoot.

34
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,979
What should we do?

35
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:32,646
Adieu.

36
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,746
Thank god you're safe my love.

37
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,889
I am so sorry you
had to see that.

38
00:05:03,913 --> 00:05:06,979
Please come. We need to hurry.
Please, please come on.

39
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:19,479
Come Marie. Let's go. We're in
danger here.

40
00:08:03,312 --> 00:08:05,312
I think that's someone's grave
sir.

41
00:08:12,746 --> 00:08:15,746
American soldiers. No need to be
afraid.

42
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:27,613
Go ahead and tell him we're on a
very important mission.

43
00:08:27,646 --> 00:08:30,646
We're looking for the grave of a
man called Von bruckner.

44
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:45,278
He said there's no Germans
buried here sir.

45
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,613
He said it's war.

46
00:08:47,646 --> 00:08:49,646
Yeah. Caught that.

47
00:08:59,513 --> 00:09:01,513
Somebody's bullshitting.

48
00:09:05,346 --> 00:09:13,346
Come mademoiselle. Walk straight
ahead. All right you got it.

49
00:09:19,513 --> 00:09:25,045
Whoa peanut. Looks like you were
rode hard and put up wet.

50
00:09:27,413 --> 00:09:29,746
Move kraut-fucker.

51
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:55,656
What's he saying? Does he have a
fucking problem?

52
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,279
He gets the point sir. Is this
necessary?

53
00:09:58,313 --> 00:10:00,513
God damn right it's necessary.
Corporal?

54
00:10:00,546 --> 00:10:01,646
All clear top.

55
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,446
Get him the fuck out of here.
Go on get out of here.

56
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,746
There's a shack. Vic.

57
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,646
Go. Move it frenchie.

58
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,680
I don't trust it.

59
00:10:23,111 --> 00:10:25,111
Relax and have a seat.

60
00:10:29,145 --> 00:10:33,145
Make yourself comfortable. We
might be here for a while.

61
00:10:41,212 --> 00:10:44,746
We've come too far to go home
empty handed. That's for sure

62
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:49,446
and I swear to you I will show
no remorse whatsoever

63
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,480
in leaving you in one of these
open graves.

64
00:10:55,313 --> 00:11:00,313
Am I making myself clear Marie?
That's good.

65
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,978
Come on. I'm gonna
help you up now.

66
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:17,145
You ok? Tell us where Von
bruckner's grave is.

67
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:19,213
I can't remember.

68
00:11:19,246 --> 00:11:21,213
You don't know? She don't...

69
00:11:21,246 --> 00:11:22,289
You're the one that told us
there was

70
00:11:22,313 --> 00:11:24,580
fucking gold here Marie.

71
00:11:24,613 --> 00:11:29,145
I can't remember.

72
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:36,613
What if I take her back behind
those trees? Get some answers.

73
00:11:36,646 --> 00:11:38,646
Like you did with that Italian
broad?

74
00:11:40,213 --> 00:11:41,580
Got the job done didn't it?

75
00:11:41,613 --> 00:11:42,656
She would have said anything.

76
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,011
Man what's your problem! Huh?
What is it to you?

77
00:11:45,045 --> 00:11:50,045
God damn it! We ain't no fucking
Nazis! Am I right?

78
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:54,179
You should fucking know that
better than anyone!

79
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,179
You know what, you're gonna
talk. She's gonna talk to us.

80
00:11:59,213 --> 00:12:01,546
You wanna know why you're gonna
talk to us.

81
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:06,746
Because we are no longer enemies
Marie.

82
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:11,279
We're all allies now whether we
like it or not.

83
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:18,313
The sooner we find the grave,
the sooner we can all go home.

84
00:12:21,146 --> 00:12:25,480
The cemetery's changed.
So many more graves now.

85
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:31,446
You have a general fucking idea
maybe?

86
00:12:33,146 --> 00:12:35,045
Maybe this?

87
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:39,078
Right here over the stream?
Right here?

88
00:12:43,146 --> 00:12:47,213
Ok. Looks like we're digging.
Let's find some shovels.

89
00:12:47,246 --> 00:12:49,011
You're with me.

90
00:12:49,045 --> 00:12:50,379
Shovels?

91
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:53,146
It's a cemetery corporal.

92
00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:56,179
You just know they got shovels
around here somewhere.

93
00:13:01,346 --> 00:13:08,279
They're doctor recommended. I've
been party to some questionable

94
00:13:08,313 --> 00:13:13,446
stuff during this here war of
ours but this here

95
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,446
takes the biscuit. Your people
were going to tar

96
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,112
and feather that girl. She
begged us to help her.

97
00:13:20,146 --> 00:13:22,279
Promised the major buried
treasure.

98
00:13:22,313 --> 00:13:25,313
He's risking a court marshal if
we get caught.

99
00:13:51,112 --> 00:13:58,112
Here. Like I said we're allies
now Marie. Come on. You need it.

100
00:14:08,213 --> 00:14:11,480
Just remember one thing. I find
out you're fucking with me

101
00:14:11,513 --> 00:14:18,046
I will kill you deader than
dirt.

102
00:14:27,613 --> 00:14:32,546
Thank you for the cigarette.

103
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:39,279
See there you go. You do speak
some English.

104
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:45,213
So you are African?

105
00:14:45,246 --> 00:14:52,379
African? No sir. I'm from
Harlem. New York City.

106
00:14:52,413 --> 00:14:53,379
New York.

107
00:14:53,413 --> 00:14:55,745
Greatest city in the world baby.

108
00:14:55,779 --> 00:15:01,246
Home of nat king Cole. Ella
Fitzgerald. Louie Armstrong.

109
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,513
Louie Armstrong. West town
blues.

110
00:15:05,546 --> 00:15:09,246
West town blues that's right.
Sometimes during this here war

111
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,279
I close my eyes and I swear I
can hear that music

112
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:19,313
playing in my head. You like
them American cigarettes I see.

113
00:15:38,513 --> 00:15:41,513
Don't get paid enough for this
shit.

114
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,012
Let's have a look Marie.

115
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:11,012
You ok corporal?

116
00:16:11,046 --> 00:16:13,046
No!

117
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:22,279
There's a body but there's no
gold.

118
00:16:22,313 --> 00:16:27,745
Well if you keep playing with us
this will not

119
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:32,313
end nicely for you. Come on.

120
00:16:41,612 --> 00:16:49,480
Right there? Next one boys. We
keep digging. Let's go.

121
00:16:50,612 --> 00:16:52,612
Ah fuck.

122
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:59,579
You have nothing to worry about.
They're not gonna hurt you.

123
00:16:59,612 --> 00:17:04,112
Just keep your mouth shut and
I'll make sure that you're safe.

124
00:17:04,146 --> 00:17:06,046
And believe me when I say I've
never seen

125
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,446
assholes like these guys before.
Major maitland.

126
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,612
He's good people. He just got
lost somewhere along the way.

127
00:17:14,645 --> 00:17:17,612
But those other two assholes now
I've followed along side

128
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:21,213
them and I've seen them do
things.

129
00:17:21,246 --> 00:17:24,612
Inexcusable things in the name
of war.

130
00:17:24,645 --> 00:17:28,645
What we doing right here we just
ain't got cause for.

131
00:17:35,712 --> 00:17:38,712
What's down there?

132
00:17:43,379 --> 00:17:47,379
Motherfucker don't make me hurt
you. What's down there?!

133
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:25,679
We're dead if they find him like
this.

134
00:18:27,046 --> 00:18:28,679
We're dead if they find him like
this.

135
00:18:28,712 --> 00:18:30,479
What? He was your new best
buddy?

136
00:18:30,512 --> 00:18:32,412
Did you have to kill him?!

137
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,146
Didn't have the time to think.

138
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:36,412
He'd have kicked the shit out of
me!

139
00:18:36,445 --> 00:18:38,112
She's here.

140
00:18:38,146 --> 00:18:39,379
Who?

141
00:18:39,412 --> 00:18:41,346
Your girlfriend.

142
00:18:41,379 --> 00:18:45,213
Your belle Marie. She finally
came back.

143
00:18:45,246 --> 00:18:47,745
So she survived?

144
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:52,146
She's here because the gold is
here!

145
00:18:52,179 --> 00:18:55,179
She must have brought the gold
here three years ago.

146
00:18:59,246 --> 00:19:00,289
What the fuck are you doing?

147
00:19:00,313 --> 00:19:02,313
Improvising.

148
00:19:04,813 --> 00:19:08,012
If she's really here, then she
needs our help.

149
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:11,612
Instead of complaining,
try helping me here!

150
00:19:11,645 --> 00:19:13,645
I think I have a plan!

151
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:24,780
No gold major. No gold.

152
00:19:24,813 --> 00:19:28,445
I thought that was it.

153
00:19:28,479 --> 00:19:31,213
It was long ago and so dark.

154
00:19:31,246 --> 00:19:34,445
Major, I can go back and get a
metal detector

155
00:19:34,479 --> 00:19:36,112
from the engineers.

156
00:19:36,146 --> 00:19:39,679
And frenchie is gonna say god
damn it four guys digging up

157
00:19:39,713 --> 00:19:44,112
graves in their graveyard. Hell
no. They're gonna call

158
00:19:44,146 --> 00:19:46,122
all their fucking buddies and be
back here digging up

159
00:19:46,146 --> 00:19:50,112
every god damn grave before your
detector ever gets here.

160
00:19:50,146 --> 00:19:56,680
I am worn god damn threadbare.
You hear me?

161
00:19:56,713 --> 00:20:00,713
I'm trying to see it in my head
like it was that night.

162
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:09,780
She's a liar and a trickster
major. I don't believe there's

163
00:20:09,813 --> 00:20:13,179
any more gold in this here
cemetery

164
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:16,213
as in my dirty, rotten kit bag.

165
00:20:31,246 --> 00:20:33,246
I'm sure.

166
00:20:35,579 --> 00:20:37,279
We'll see.

167
00:20:38,345 --> 00:20:40,345
Shit.

168
00:20:44,046 --> 00:20:47,046
Yes sir. No sir.

169
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,378
That's not funny.

170
00:20:49,412 --> 00:20:52,146
Look at this.

171
00:20:52,179 --> 00:20:54,378
These Americans are so big, what
do they eat?

172
00:20:54,412 --> 00:20:59,378
Well, they eat actual food.
That's a good start I guess.

173
00:20:59,412 --> 00:21:01,412
Here, clean yourself up.

174
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:14,079
You stay here and cover me from
the door.

175
00:21:23,713 --> 00:21:25,713
Take this.

176
00:21:35,412 --> 00:21:38,613
Lie down if the shooting starts.

177
00:21:38,646 --> 00:21:40,713
I hope you know what you're
doing.

178
00:21:40,746 --> 00:21:42,746
No fucking way.

179
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,512
There's no gold in here.

180
00:22:08,546 --> 00:22:13,746
God damn it! Major! You get it?!

181
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,680
Taking us on a wild goose chase
are you!

182
00:22:15,713 --> 00:22:20,680
Is that what you're
doing?! Bitch!

183
00:22:20,713 --> 00:22:24,278
What the fuck's your boy
doing? Why's he left his post?

184
00:22:24,312 --> 00:22:26,613
I don't know. Maybe he wants to
trade out.

185
00:22:26,646 --> 00:22:29,079
I don't like it.

186
00:22:29,112 --> 00:22:31,212
Corporal, go see what's going
on.

187
00:22:31,245 --> 00:22:33,245
Yes sir.

188
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:47,112
Vic what're you doing?

189
00:22:55,112 --> 00:22:59,112
Stay down. Stay close.

190
00:23:10,513 --> 00:23:12,513
Cover me major.

191
00:23:32,513 --> 00:23:34,312
How you doing buddy?

192
00:23:34,345 --> 00:23:36,345
Through and through.

193
00:23:38,613 --> 00:23:40,613
Give me a grenade.

194
00:23:47,412 --> 00:23:49,412
Hold your cover.

195
00:24:08,111 --> 00:24:11,111
No! No! No!

196
00:24:33,178 --> 00:24:37,480
Clear. Fucker just disappeared.

197
00:24:37,513 --> 00:24:39,513
Come on. You go first.

198
00:24:55,312 --> 00:24:57,012
Stay right here.

199
00:24:57,045 --> 00:24:59,045
All clear.

200
00:25:05,145 --> 00:25:10,145
What the fuck is this about?
Look at me.

201
00:25:13,212 --> 00:25:14,746
Were they here waiting for us
Marie?

202
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:17,446
Were you setting us up for a
fucking setup?

203
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,480
I don't know. I'm not with them.

204
00:25:23,111 --> 00:25:28,278
We're under strict orders not to
get involved with any reprisals

205
00:25:28,312 --> 00:25:34,111
but we made an exception for
you. Help me she said.

206
00:25:34,145 --> 00:25:37,580
Help me and I'll show you where
they hid the gold right?

207
00:25:37,613 --> 00:25:40,613
Help me and I'll make you god
damn rich.

208
00:25:47,446 --> 00:25:51,680
Risk being court marshaled on
your word.

209
00:25:51,713 --> 00:25:53,713
Do you know what that means?

210
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:07,613
Badger holes all over the
damn place.

211
00:26:07,646 --> 00:26:10,646
Badger? What the fuck is a
badger?

212
00:26:43,813 --> 00:26:51,813
I'm gonna be ok right? I'm gonna
be ok yeah?

213
00:26:52,045 --> 00:26:55,145
100% copacetic brother.

214
00:26:55,178 --> 00:27:02,413
Fuck that redneck boy. You can't
lie worth a shit.

215
00:27:02,446 --> 00:27:03,480
Top.

216
00:27:03,513 --> 00:27:04,780
Chris.

217
00:27:04,813 --> 00:27:08,680
Jerry, don't leave me here.

218
00:27:08,713 --> 00:27:11,111
You have my word. You have my
word.

219
00:27:11,145 --> 00:27:12,045
Promise?

220
00:27:12,078 --> 00:27:14,746
I do.

221
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,978
Hayseed.

222
00:27:25,246 --> 00:27:27,246
Bye old pal.

223
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,078
What do we do with him?

224
00:27:36,111 --> 00:27:43,111
Makes no difference right now
does it? Let's get to it.

225
00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:01,045
See that bloody mess lying in
the hole right there?

226
00:28:01,078 --> 00:28:09,078
That's our Chris. We all landed
in sicily. Fought our way up

227
00:28:10,379 --> 00:28:14,379
through southern France fighting
for y'all.

228
00:28:19,246 --> 00:28:24,011
Chris, he killed a lot of Nazis.

229
00:28:24,045 --> 00:28:27,179
He was god damned
good at it too.

230
00:28:27,213 --> 00:28:30,746
Wasn't the youngest man. Wasn't
the smartest man either but

231
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:38,780
well he was out with me.
There he is lying in that.

232
00:28:41,145 --> 00:28:48,746
God damned hole because of you.

233
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:55,379
Not because of me. Because of
your greed.

234
00:28:55,413 --> 00:28:59,580
You didn't kill Nazis for me or
my people.

235
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:01,522
You killed them because they
were shooting at you and

236
00:29:01,546 --> 00:29:07,313
wearing a different uniform.
You're no heroes.

237
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:13,146
You're just survivors. The last
man standing.

238
00:29:13,179 --> 00:29:15,546
Call it a day.

239
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:19,546
Tired of her shit boss and i'm
done listening to this bitch.

240
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:23,613
Come on Jerry. Come on now. Give
yourself a second and think

241
00:29:23,646 --> 00:29:28,045
about this. Two of our good men
died digging for that.

242
00:29:28,078 --> 00:29:32,213
God damned gold and one of hers
died defending.

243
00:29:32,246 --> 00:29:38,346
I swear to you my brother there
is gold here but hey you want to

244
00:29:38,379 --> 00:29:42,379
slit her throat and get us home
nice and early then be my guest.

245
00:29:56,613 --> 00:30:02,613
Tie her up Jerry and then we'll
go looking for that tunnel rat.

246
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,480
Got a present for you my little
French badger.

247
00:30:42,379 --> 00:30:43,646
God damn!

248
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,112
You ok Jerry?

249
00:30:46,146 --> 00:30:50,146
All ok. That was bigger than I
thought it was going to be.

250
00:30:58,513 --> 00:31:00,646
Do you want to die here,
clement?

251
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:03,679
In this shit-hole, after all
that you've been through?

252
00:31:08,546 --> 00:31:12,379
The war is finally over.

253
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:15,712
It's time for you to start
living again.

254
00:31:15,745 --> 00:31:18,480
And you're going to give up?

255
00:31:18,513 --> 00:31:20,513
Suffocated in your own grave?

256
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:24,046
Shut the fuck up, George! Why
are you speaking?

257
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:26,146
You're dead.

258
00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:28,379
You're dead and still bugging
me!

259
00:31:28,413 --> 00:31:31,146
You'll be joining me soon
enough, brother.

260
00:31:31,179 --> 00:31:33,446
And for what?

261
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,712
Some woman.

262
00:31:34,745 --> 00:31:39,213
Some woman you fantasize about
who doesn't even remember you?

263
00:31:39,246 --> 00:31:42,046
Empty promises of gold.

264
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:43,645
She's here, no?

265
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,679
I'm gonna find the Americans and
kill those sons of bitches.

266
00:31:46,712 --> 00:31:47,246
Yes?

267
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,246
Yes!

268
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:51,580
And Marie? What will you do to
her, my friend?

269
00:31:51,612 --> 00:31:54,346
I love her, she never did
anything wrong.

270
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:55,480
Stop!

271
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:56,146
We were the ones who failed her,
leaving the cemetery!

272
00:31:56,179 --> 00:31:59,313
Keep telling yourself that.

273
00:31:59,346 --> 00:32:01,213
Women were always your downfall.

274
00:32:01,246 --> 00:32:07,046
She will get you killed and
betray you again!

275
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:10,779
I'm getting out of here. And
I'll show you who I am!

276
00:32:10,812 --> 00:32:13,779
What are you waiting for? Go,
now!

277
00:32:13,812 --> 00:32:15,213
I'm going to live.

278
00:32:15,246 --> 00:32:17,246
I'm gonna live for her.

279
00:32:38,413 --> 00:32:44,179
I don't speak no fucking frog.
You understand that?

280
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:51,779
Can I tell you a poem?
Especially for you major.

281
00:32:51,812 --> 00:32:54,779
Yeah sure. Why not?

282
00:32:54,812 --> 00:32:59,679
Feet in the gladiolus, he's
sleeping. Smiling like a sick

283
00:32:59,712 --> 00:33:03,213
child would smile he takes a
nap.

284
00:33:03,246 --> 00:33:08,279
Nature rocks him warmly for he's
cold. Fragrances do not

285
00:33:08,313 --> 00:33:13,179
make his nostrils quiver. He
sleeps in the sun.

286
00:33:13,213 --> 00:33:19,213
Hands on his chest. He has two
red holes on his right side.

287
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:27,012
What the fuck is that supposed
to mean?

288
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:30,379
Rimbaud wrote it when he was
16-years-old.

289
00:33:30,413 --> 00:33:34,146
It's about a soldier.

290
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:40,279
You are good Marie. You know
that? And that smile of yours.

291
00:33:40,313 --> 00:33:42,512
I don't think a Nazi had a god
damned chance

292
00:33:42,545 --> 00:33:48,112
against that smile of yours.
Am I right? What was it?

293
00:33:48,146 --> 00:33:56,146
Money? Security maybe? I wonder.
You know that. I wonder. What

294
00:33:58,645 --> 00:34:02,645
they offered you for you to turn
on your own god damned country.

295
00:34:12,046 --> 00:34:15,612
This song is based on a German
children's story.

296
00:34:15,645 --> 00:34:18,179
The little mermaid.

297
00:34:21,779 --> 00:34:24,213
It's about immortal who falls in
love with a human

298
00:34:24,246 --> 00:34:28,246
and learns that true love can
have tragic consequences.

299
00:34:52,579 --> 00:34:54,579
It's a fortune.

300
00:35:02,313 --> 00:35:07,780
Money means nothing to me. I
just need you.

301
00:35:07,813 --> 00:35:11,545
You're young and
idealistic. Believe it or not

302
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:18,412
I was once very much like you.
It's not the gold we need.

303
00:35:18,445 --> 00:35:25,246
It's what it buys us. Freedom,
security, power.

304
00:35:25,279 --> 00:35:30,612
What about the people we've
stolen it from?

305
00:35:30,645 --> 00:35:32,780
I'm sure the chief of the
chancellor in Berlin

306
00:35:32,813 --> 00:35:34,379
is not going to be happy.

307
00:35:34,412 --> 00:35:36,746
No I mean the people it belonged
to before him.

308
00:35:38,246 --> 00:35:46,213
What does it matter? It is ours
now. I stole this for us.

309
00:35:46,246 --> 00:35:54,246
So that when the fighting is
over we can live as befits us.

310
00:35:55,512 --> 00:35:59,512
And what about this? Won't
people know where it's from?

311
00:36:01,612 --> 00:36:05,179
Time passes. Wars end.

312
00:36:05,213 --> 00:36:09,213
We'll wait until it's safe and
then make our escape.

313
00:36:12,713 --> 00:36:18,046
The cemetery was a magnificent
suggestion my love.

314
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:22,079
Such a prudent place to hide a
treasure.

315
00:36:34,345 --> 00:36:35,421
Doesn't really matter much
anyway.

316
00:36:35,445 --> 00:36:37,213
I'm sure you had your reasons.

317
00:36:37,246 --> 00:36:43,046
But I'll tell this is for sure.
We don't find that fucking gold

318
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:51,079
by sundown you will never smile
again. You understand that?

319
00:36:51,713 --> 00:36:53,012
Go to hell.

320
00:36:53,046 --> 00:37:01,046
Glad we understand each other.

321
00:37:01,746 --> 00:37:07,046
Bear them away on your snow
white wings to their

322
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:15,079
immortal place. It's a better
place now boys with the lord.

323
00:37:35,146 --> 00:37:38,012
This is the nutmeg. Go ahead s2.

324
00:37:38,046 --> 00:37:42,613
Be advised jayhawk noted company
strength 2nd ss east of

325
00:37:42,646 --> 00:37:47,479
headed due
south via route 44. Confirm.

326
00:37:47,512 --> 00:37:50,512
Nutmeg confirmed. Thank you s2.

327
00:38:30,479 --> 00:38:34,046
Degaulle is in Paris.

328
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,556
Leclerc and the 2nd armored
division took it

329
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:38,212
with the help of eisenhower.

330
00:38:38,245 --> 00:38:40,179
It's a fucking joke.

331
00:38:40,212 --> 00:38:42,445
Russians have chased us
out of Poland, the allies

332
00:38:42,479 --> 00:38:44,479
have us on the run in Italy...

333
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:51,046
And we're officially finished
here.

334
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:54,546
We can't surrender to the
bolsheviks, they'll execute us

335
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,345
for our uniforms.

336
00:38:56,378 --> 00:38:59,378
And of course, our blood
tattoos.

337
00:39:03,512 --> 00:39:06,512
Life as we know it is over.

338
00:39:25,445 --> 00:39:28,178
Le chemin de la liberte.

339
00:39:28,212 --> 00:39:30,445
There are several secret escape
routes over the central.

340
00:39:30,479 --> 00:39:34,245
Pyrenees into northern Spain.

341
00:39:34,278 --> 00:39:41,780
We'll have safe haven there, and
enough time to decide what to do.

342
00:39:41,813 --> 00:39:44,178
Talk to the men.

343
00:39:44,212 --> 00:39:47,713
Those that wish to, may join me.

344
00:39:47,746 --> 00:39:50,580
Those that don't can do as they
please.

345
00:39:50,613 --> 00:39:52,613
Same thing for you.

346
00:39:52,646 --> 00:39:55,646
I am with you, herr Von
bruckner.

347
00:40:03,513 --> 00:40:07,345
Get firearms and as much
ammunition as we can carry.

348
00:40:07,378 --> 00:40:10,412
We should march in the evening
and through the night.

349
00:40:10,445 --> 00:40:13,445
Tell no one our destination.

350
00:40:17,046 --> 00:40:22,580
I have one place I must visit on
the way.

351
00:40:22,613 --> 00:40:26,245
A fraulein, herr Von bruckner?

352
00:40:26,278 --> 00:40:28,278
Marie dujardin, the girl that we
had released

353
00:40:28,312 --> 00:40:30,646
from ravensbruck prison.

354
00:40:35,046 --> 00:40:39,278
There was a woman once.

355
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:42,312
Now just another grave.

356
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:11,378
Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck!

357
00:41:24,646 --> 00:41:28,111
You might want to come look at
this.

358
00:41:28,145 --> 00:41:31,312
We got us a heap of trouble.

359
00:41:31,345 --> 00:41:32,713
They're coming down here.

360
00:41:32,746 --> 00:41:33,780
Where are we?

361
00:41:33,813 --> 00:41:36,012
Right there.

362
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:40,145
That does make this route 44
Jerry?

363
00:41:40,178 --> 00:41:42,212
Sure does. 100 percent.

364
00:41:42,245 --> 00:41:46,078
That means they'll be coming
down right on top of us here.

365
00:41:46,111 --> 00:41:51,546
Yes sir. Company 2nd ss.

366
00:42:05,813 --> 00:42:07,480
You're on your own from here.

367
00:42:07,513 --> 00:42:10,111
Allied forces are five miles
west.

368
00:42:10,145 --> 00:42:13,145
I'll hold them as long as I can.

369
00:42:19,312 --> 00:42:22,312
Get a move on, do you want to
live forever?

370
00:42:32,513 --> 00:42:40,513
Company the 2nd ss division. Das
reich. Hitler's elite guard.

371
00:42:41,513 --> 00:42:43,313
They ain't looking to give
themselves up to

372
00:42:43,346 --> 00:42:45,580
two u. S. Infantrymen.

373
00:42:45,613 --> 00:42:48,480
Heading south. Launch from the
beach maybe?

374
00:42:48,513 --> 00:42:51,546
There's a chance they just pass
us by.

375
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:57,780
Hell no Jerry. Hell no they're
coming. I tell you what,

376
00:42:57,813 --> 00:42:59,011
you've been right all long.

377
00:42:59,045 --> 00:43:04,680
She's been fucking with us since
hour one. But I'll tell you

378
00:43:04,713 --> 00:43:08,178
this, my old friend. When it
comes to this particular little

379
00:43:08,212 --> 00:43:13,546
war we've got going on right
here. It ain't over just yet.

380
00:43:16,279 --> 00:43:21,613
I think it's about time you and
I straighten a few things out.

381
00:43:21,646 --> 00:43:23,556
When you told me you knew that
there was German gold

382
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:26,680
hidden you were telling the
truth but you weren't being

383
00:43:26,713 --> 00:43:29,346
all together too
honest now were you?

384
00:43:29,379 --> 00:43:30,746
I've told you no lies.

385
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:33,746
Oh I know there's gold here or
so help me I would have

386
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:36,111
cracked your skull and never
looked back.

387
00:43:36,145 --> 00:43:37,580
Sounds like a good plan boss.

388
00:43:37,613 --> 00:43:40,480
But there is gold here Jerry.
There is gold because

389
00:43:40,513 --> 00:43:43,513
her boyfriend put it here.

390
00:43:43,546 --> 00:43:47,480
And he arranged to meet her
and she kept her promise.

391
00:43:47,513 --> 00:43:52,346
Kraut gets the gold and the
girl.

392
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:56,480
No, no. That ain't gonna happen
Marie. Want to know why?

393
00:43:56,513 --> 00:44:00,011
See your boyfriend. He's still
gotta cross the tracks.

394
00:44:00,045 --> 00:44:03,078
Navigate his way through the
river. Gives us about an hour

395
00:44:03,111 --> 00:44:09,011
or so to play a little game.

396
00:44:09,045 --> 00:44:12,045
Sergeant you remember that game
we played in salerno?

397
00:44:12,078 --> 00:44:14,313
Sure do.

398
00:44:14,346 --> 00:44:17,145
Bring me a cadaver skull.

399
00:44:17,178 --> 00:44:19,178
You got it.

400
00:44:30,313 --> 00:44:33,313
If I were you I'd keep real
still Marie.

401
00:44:35,713 --> 00:44:39,713
Now you're sure there's nothing
else you want to tell us?

402
00:44:47,045 --> 00:44:50,045
Easy, easy, easy.

403
00:45:06,279 --> 00:45:08,613
I ain't the best shot by no
means at all.

404
00:45:08,646 --> 00:45:11,646
Tell if you know where it is.

405
00:45:18,279 --> 00:45:19,355
You want to tell us where that
gold is

406
00:45:19,379 --> 00:45:21,379
maybe we can all go home.

407
00:45:38,078 --> 00:45:39,313
No, no, no, no.

408
00:45:39,346 --> 00:45:44,346
You listen to me. Listen to me.
That little kraut pistol ain't

409
00:45:44,379 --> 00:45:49,379
worth squat at this distance so
you stay real still.

410
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:52,413
That's it little lady. Now.

411
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:05,746
I'm doing my best to remember.
I promise.

412
00:46:05,779 --> 00:46:07,213
Sun's in his eyes.

413
00:46:07,246 --> 00:46:09,580
You sure you got nothing else to
tell us?

414
00:46:09,613 --> 00:46:17,613
Please. Please don't do this.

415
00:46:33,613 --> 00:46:36,446
Bull shit.

416
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,713
Stop! I'll show you where the
fucking grave is!

417
00:46:40,745 --> 00:46:43,313
I'll give you your gold!

418
00:46:43,346 --> 00:46:50,179
Untie me. I'll show you. I'll
take you. Just stop it!

419
00:46:50,213 --> 00:46:54,079
Jerry, you go check
on those krauts. I'm gonna give

420
00:46:54,112 --> 00:46:56,246
her one more chance and then
we're out of here.

421
00:46:56,279 --> 00:46:58,112
Please. It wasn't like you
think.

422
00:46:58,146 --> 00:47:01,146
You'll understand
when I tell you.

423
00:47:03,413 --> 00:47:07,413
The cemetery was a magnificent
suggestion my love.

424
00:47:20,346 --> 00:47:23,112
There was a plan.

425
00:47:23,146 --> 00:47:27,011
I knew Von bruckner planned to
be at the cemetery at 10:30.

426
00:47:27,046 --> 00:47:30,712
Punctuality was important to
him. The housekeeper would pass

427
00:47:30,745 --> 00:47:33,546
my note to the resistance to set
up an ambush

428
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:35,580
to take back the gold.

429
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:46,413
Wait here. I'll be back.

430
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:48,446
No, no, no don't leave me.

431
00:47:54,745 --> 00:47:56,646
Look at this!

432
00:47:56,679 --> 00:47:58,645
No.

433
00:48:03,446 --> 00:48:09,480
With you.

434
00:48:09,513 --> 00:48:13,346
I'm part of the resistance.
Where's George?

435
00:48:13,379 --> 00:48:15,379
He's supposed to be here.

436
00:48:35,812 --> 00:48:38,012
Adieu.

437
00:48:54,812 --> 00:48:59,580
Here it is. It hasn't changed a
bit.

438
00:48:59,612 --> 00:49:02,146
I hope you're not
afraid of ghosts.

439
00:49:06,812 --> 00:49:12,012
No Marie. I don't fear the dead.
Only the living.

440
00:49:26,413 --> 00:49:28,413
Here.

441
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:40,679
My sweet ss officer, they're
already dead.

442
00:49:40,712 --> 00:49:44,279
There's nothing more that can be
done to them.

443
00:49:44,313 --> 00:49:48,313
There's nothing more they can do
to you.

444
00:49:51,712 --> 00:49:57,313
Did you know them? Marie?

445
00:49:57,346 --> 00:50:03,346
No. It'll be safe here. Nobody
comes here anymore.

446
00:50:48,413 --> 00:50:51,246
Marie, are you all right?

447
00:50:51,279 --> 00:50:59,279
Yeah. I'm fine. I'm just
exhausted my love.

448
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:09,146
I want to feel you inside of me.

449
00:51:49,645 --> 00:51:50,645
I'm sorry.

450
00:51:50,679 --> 00:51:52,679
For what?

451
00:52:59,512 --> 00:53:02,313
The resistance was supposed to
be waiting at the cemetery

452
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:06,378
but no one was there. So I had
to do it alone.

453
00:53:06,412 --> 00:53:10,179
When I left I was arrested by
the ss. Without Von bruckner

454
00:53:10,213 --> 00:53:13,445
to protect me they said I had no
right to be there

455
00:53:13,479 --> 00:53:17,479
and threw me in ravensbruck for
three years.

456
00:53:27,512 --> 00:53:34,780
Ok. Well Marie, not only are you
a French whore but you're

457
00:53:34,813 --> 00:53:40,012
a murderer as well. You're
family must be proud as punch.

458
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:49,612
The grave belongs to my family.
My mother and father

459
00:53:49,646 --> 00:53:56,612
were tortured and murdered by an
ss officer called Von bruckner.

460
00:53:56,646 --> 00:54:02,246
They were farmers. They would
never hurt anyone.

461
00:54:02,279 --> 00:54:05,278
They didn't even understand the
war.

462
00:54:06,612 --> 00:54:08,612
Where Marie?

463
00:54:11,179 --> 00:54:13,179
Follow me.

464
00:54:36,146 --> 00:54:41,146
This it? Du-jar-din.

465
00:54:49,646 --> 00:54:50,613
Maybe lift Jerry?

466
00:54:50,646 --> 00:54:58,646
Yep. You wanna try sliding it?

467
00:55:19,278 --> 00:55:23,278
Well bless her pea picking
little heart.

468
00:55:23,312 --> 00:55:27,312
No more digging coal for me. You
weren't lying.

469
00:55:35,112 --> 00:55:41,079
Ok. Let's pack this up and get
the hell out of dodge, Jerry.

470
00:55:41,112 --> 00:55:46,146
She's still lying like an old
legged dog, top.

471
00:55:46,178 --> 00:55:50,245
There ain't no kraut in that
grave.

472
00:55:50,278 --> 00:55:53,278
Impossible. I shot him.

473
00:56:22,513 --> 00:56:25,513
Maybe he up and flew away.

474
00:56:25,546 --> 00:56:28,345
No, no, no I swear I lifted him
and

475
00:56:28,378 --> 00:56:30,212
I put him in the grave myself.

476
00:56:30,245 --> 00:56:33,245
Don't matter much anymore Marie
now does it?

477
00:56:39,079 --> 00:56:45,445
We got the gold Jerry. Let's go
home. I think now would be a

478
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:49,780
good time for you to kill her
and leave her with her parents.

479
00:56:49,813 --> 00:56:52,178
Music to my ears boss.

480
00:56:52,212 --> 00:56:54,212
Nobody fucking move!

481
00:56:58,646 --> 00:57:01,178
Finally, you came back to us.

482
00:57:01,212 --> 00:57:04,713
We've been waiting a long time
for you, Marie.

483
00:57:04,746 --> 00:57:07,746
Grab the bag and bring it here.

484
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:13,345
You ready Jerry?

485
00:57:30,513 --> 00:57:31,613
You ok sergeant?

486
00:57:31,646 --> 00:57:35,713
Like old blue on the porch
chewing a big old catfish.

487
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,321
The ambush was supposed to be
here at the cemetery,

488
00:57:45,345 --> 00:57:46,746
not on the road.

489
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:49,680
I waited for you. Look at me!
Look at me!

490
00:57:49,713 --> 00:57:51,513
Three years I waited!

491
00:57:51,546 --> 00:57:53,245
It's not our fault, Marie.

492
00:57:53,278 --> 00:57:55,580
The maquis were afraid we'd been
compromised,

493
00:57:55,613 --> 00:57:58,546
so they moved the ambush
to highway 44.

494
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:01,111
We had to follow orders, Marie.

495
00:58:01,145 --> 00:58:03,746
We were ordered to leave here
after the ambush went bad.

496
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:06,979
We should have been there for
you.

497
00:58:09,212 --> 00:58:10,646
They tried to kill me.

498
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:13,680
I'm sorry, Marie. I'm sorry...

499
00:58:14,278 --> 00:58:17,345
You're sorry?

500
00:58:17,379 --> 00:58:21,245
I looked for you everyday, asked
after you, tried to find you.

501
00:58:21,278 --> 00:58:24,278
Every day, every day, every day
Marie.

502
00:58:24,413 --> 00:58:28,145
I spent three years in
ravensbruck jail.

503
00:58:28,178 --> 00:58:30,613
After I got out the
resistance accused me of

504
00:58:30,646 --> 00:58:33,613
being a collaborator. These
soldiers got me away from them.

505
00:58:33,646 --> 00:58:35,111
Let's get this thing done ay.

506
00:58:35,145 --> 00:58:35,713
You got it.

507
00:58:35,746 --> 00:58:37,746
Flank me.

508
00:58:43,078 --> 00:58:45,011
Have you betrayed us to the
Americans?

509
00:58:45,045 --> 00:58:46,580
There was nothing I could do.

510
00:58:46,613 --> 00:58:49,580
I always wondered whose side you
were on.

511
00:58:49,613 --> 00:58:53,178
Even three years ago with your
kraut officer.

512
00:58:53,212 --> 00:58:56,346
I've made such a mistake.

513
00:58:56,379 --> 00:58:59,178
That was your mistake. Your men
didn't recognize me.

514
00:58:59,212 --> 00:59:01,111
Everything went wrong.

515
00:59:01,145 --> 00:59:03,613
You weren't at your cemetery.

516
00:59:03,646 --> 00:59:07,613
I shot Von bruckner and hid the
gold.

517
00:59:07,646 --> 00:59:10,646
I did the job you couldn't.

518
00:59:13,446 --> 00:59:16,978
Excuse me, Marie. Please. Excuse
me.

519
00:59:53,546 --> 00:59:55,546
Put it down.

520
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:02,346
I was just trying to help you.

521
01:00:02,379 --> 01:00:05,379
Don't look that way from where
I'm standing.

522
01:00:08,178 --> 01:00:11,513
Tell your friend to come on out.
I promise I won't shoot him.

523
01:00:14,346 --> 01:00:17,446
He wants you to come out. He
won't shoot...

524
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:20,078
For the moment.

525
01:00:20,111 --> 01:00:23,245
You're one clever trickster
Marie.

526
01:00:28,379 --> 01:00:30,480
He doesn't believe you.

527
01:00:30,513 --> 01:00:33,045
Tell him we have no beef with
the resistance.

528
01:00:33,078 --> 01:00:35,480
There's more than enough gold to
go around.

529
01:00:35,513 --> 01:00:38,011
They say they just want the
gold.

530
01:00:38,045 --> 01:00:39,011
Jesus Christ.

531
01:00:39,045 --> 01:00:39,746
You good major?

532
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:41,212
Yeah I'll live.

533
01:00:41,246 --> 01:00:42,289
I figure we get that one out of
cover,

534
01:00:42,313 --> 01:00:44,011
kill 'em both and keep moving.

535
01:00:44,045 --> 01:00:48,078
Too late Jerry. Ss will be here
in minutes. We have to go

536
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:50,346
down the same road that there
heading toward.

537
01:00:50,379 --> 01:00:52,154
There's no chance we can leave
without them seeing us.

538
01:00:52,178 --> 01:00:53,379
What you figure?

539
01:00:53,413 --> 01:00:56,145
There ain't that many of them
Jerry. Way I see it is if we

540
01:00:56,178 --> 01:01:00,078
ambush them just right, they
won't stand a chance.

541
01:01:00,111 --> 01:01:02,446
But we need shooters.

542
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,722
What the hell are they talking
about?!

543
01:01:03,746 --> 01:01:06,279
He says the Germans are coming
and if we try

544
01:01:06,313 --> 01:01:08,111
to run away we're dead.

545
01:01:08,145 --> 01:01:13,746
Ok Marie. You tell him we will
let you both live and we will

546
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:15,313
give you a piece of the gold

547
01:01:15,346 --> 01:01:17,646
but you gotta help us
kill these Nazis.

548
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,513
I don't like it but I get it.

549
01:01:20,546 --> 01:01:22,713
He wants you to fight with them.

550
01:01:22,746 --> 01:01:28,213
They want a real
resistance fighter.

551
01:01:28,246 --> 01:01:30,178
They want a real resistance
fighter.

552
01:01:30,213 --> 01:01:32,178
I don't understand.

553
01:01:32,213 --> 01:01:34,246
Ok keep him talking Jerry.

554
01:01:34,279 --> 01:01:36,011
You got it.

555
01:01:40,413 --> 01:01:44,111
Come on out my little French
badger. Come on.

556
01:01:44,145 --> 01:01:46,145
You can come out.

557
01:01:54,078 --> 01:01:57,078
So, you in or you out?

558
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,680
How we looking?

559
01:02:43,513 --> 01:02:46,713
He can see them and they have
lots of guns.

560
01:02:46,746 --> 01:02:53,346
Come on. Let's get ready.

561
01:03:00,313 --> 01:03:02,513
What's he getting excited about?

562
01:03:02,546 --> 01:03:04,279
He thinks it's suicide.

563
01:03:04,313 --> 01:03:09,446
Whoa Marie. You think it's
suicide? Well we figure they're

564
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:13,146
on their way cross-country to
Spain. Now the fact that they

565
01:03:13,179 --> 01:03:16,580
made a detour here makes us
highly suspicious of the

566
01:03:16,613 --> 01:03:21,379
lovely Marie. That and the fact
that her lover boy's body

567
01:03:21,413 --> 01:03:26,213
just happens to not be where she
says she left it.

568
01:03:26,246 --> 01:03:30,379
I've already told you I don't
know why he isn't there anymore.

569
01:03:30,413 --> 01:03:37,246
Well, paradise awaits. Let's get
to it. Hey top.

570
01:03:37,279 --> 01:03:42,580
I'd say we got about 15 minutes
Max. Give me that glass.

571
01:04:05,313 --> 01:04:09,279
We've got 3 full out. 3 on the
hip. 10 extra grenades and

572
01:04:09,313 --> 01:04:13,745
some composition from Vic's
backpack. What else we got?

573
01:04:13,779 --> 01:04:15,446
That's about it top.

574
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:18,446
It's gonna have to suffice.

575
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,012
I guess so.

576
01:04:21,046 --> 01:04:29,046
Frenchie. Let's move.

577
01:04:30,179 --> 01:04:32,179
Are you serious?

578
01:04:49,679 --> 01:04:52,379
Not too close my American
friend.

579
01:04:53,346 --> 01:04:56,346
Tricky little badger aren't you?

580
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:24,246
Did you really shoot that kraut,
Marie?

581
01:05:24,279 --> 01:05:27,745
I shot him in the head. He went
down. Pretty sure you

582
01:05:27,779 --> 01:05:31,979
can't survive that. He was cold
when I moved him.

583
01:05:37,112 --> 01:05:41,112
Well you can talk the talk but
can you walk the walk?

584
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:48,079
You said you can shoot. Question
is can you really?

585
01:05:58,046 --> 01:06:02,346
I grew up on a farm. I know
guns.

586
01:06:02,379 --> 01:06:06,346
Ok. You just follow your
instincts Marie

587
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:09,379
and you'll be just fine.

588
01:06:14,346 --> 01:06:16,346
You think we'll make it.

589
01:06:21,279 --> 01:06:26,379
Well I've always been good at
it. Survival, I mean.

590
01:06:26,413 --> 01:06:30,579
Never really been good at
anything else.

591
01:06:30,612 --> 01:06:36,745
That don't mean much in the real
world. I don't mean much either.

592
01:06:36,779 --> 01:06:42,112
Too poor to paint. Too proud to
whitewash.

593
01:06:42,146 --> 01:06:48,513
See that's why I need the gold
Marie. I need a fresh start.

594
01:06:48,545 --> 01:06:56,545
I need to start over. You're
mocking me.

595
01:06:56,745 --> 01:07:00,612
You think gold pulled from the
teeth of Jews, wedding

596
01:07:00,645 --> 01:07:05,379
rings stolen from their cold
hands, menorahs snatched

597
01:07:05,413 --> 01:07:12,079
from their fireplaces doesn't
come with a price?

598
01:07:12,112 --> 01:07:17,012
Look around you. I didn't hide
the gold for myself.

599
01:07:17,046 --> 01:07:23,046
I hid it because it's cursed.

600
01:07:23,079 --> 01:07:27,679
But I'm an American Marie. We
don't believe in spirits.

601
01:07:27,712 --> 01:07:35,346
We don't believe in no curses.
We believe in gold.

602
01:07:35,379 --> 01:07:39,712
Yeah that's right Marie. In gold
we trust.

603
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:22,213
All good top?

604
01:08:22,246 --> 01:08:24,246
Yeah I'm good.

605
01:08:37,146 --> 01:08:39,246
You ok there frenchie?

606
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:42,079
When this goes, it will take out
their legs without

607
01:08:42,112 --> 01:08:43,479
destroying your Jeep!

608
01:08:43,512 --> 01:08:45,512
That's good.

609
01:08:52,112 --> 01:08:55,246
S1 patch me through to bomber
command.

610
01:09:47,579 --> 01:09:49,713
Thank you.

611
01:09:49,746 --> 01:09:51,746
You're welcome.

612
01:09:55,146 --> 01:09:59,378
We're probably gonna die here.
You know that?

613
01:09:59,412 --> 01:10:03,279
I don't know.

614
01:10:03,313 --> 01:10:06,246
You regret your part in this?

615
01:10:06,279 --> 01:10:08,780
Well I got a whole belly full of
regrets since I signed up

616
01:10:08,813 --> 01:10:11,645
for this war, miss.

617
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:19,179
So why did you do it? Why did
you come with him?

618
01:10:19,213 --> 01:10:26,412
Don't rightly know. Maitland,
he's my friend I guess.

619
01:10:26,445 --> 01:10:31,412
We're older than the others.
Army signed us because they

620
01:10:31,445 --> 01:10:37,479
needed mature leaders of men.
Men of character. Seems

621
01:10:37,512 --> 01:10:40,345
like age doesn't define
character quite the way they

622
01:10:40,378 --> 01:10:48,378
figured. Maybe it's like you.
Sometimes life takes the lead

623
01:10:53,612 --> 01:11:01,146
And you've no choice but to
follow. Good luck Marie.

624
01:11:16,378 --> 01:11:21,012
All that work, the unspeakable
sacrifice, all that waiting.

625
01:11:21,046 --> 01:11:26,146
All for her and she didn't even
glance at you.

626
01:11:26,179 --> 01:11:28,213
You really believe the
Americans,

627
01:11:28,245 --> 01:11:29,746
the "ricains,"

628
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:32,545
are gonna split the gold with
you?

629
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:36,345
They'll shoot you and Bury you
with the krauts, you moron!

630
01:11:36,378 --> 01:11:38,213
I'm not going to speak to you.

631
01:11:38,245 --> 01:11:40,245
You're dead!

632
01:11:40,278 --> 01:11:43,345
I saw you die! Let me do my
part, asshole.

633
01:11:43,378 --> 01:11:45,545
Don't you fucking dare leave me
here, clement!

634
01:11:45,580 --> 01:11:48,046
You're gonna die like me if you
don't listen!

635
01:11:48,079 --> 01:11:50,278
Hell is waiting for you and it's
much worse than

636
01:11:50,312 --> 01:11:52,580
you could ever imagine!

637
01:11:52,613 --> 01:11:55,046
Shut up, man!

638
01:11:55,079 --> 01:11:58,345
Shut up, man! Shut the fuck up!

639
01:11:58,378 --> 01:12:00,780
Don't you remember, clement, i'm
dead?

640
01:12:00,813 --> 01:12:03,545
Why are you talking to a dead
man?

641
01:12:03,580 --> 01:12:05,580
I am dead.

642
01:16:10,746 --> 01:16:12,646
Viva France!

643
01:18:09,546 --> 01:18:11,413
All this death for nothing.

644
01:18:13,313 --> 01:18:15,246
And you?

645
01:18:15,279 --> 01:18:18,145
You never even managed to tell
her you loved her?

646
01:19:32,513 --> 01:19:39,213
Bad fucking luck. Picked one
that knew how to tangle.

647
01:19:39,246 --> 01:19:40,346
Can you move?

648
01:19:40,379 --> 01:19:44,713
Feels like I was 'et by a wolf
and shit over a cliff.

649
01:19:44,745 --> 01:19:47,112
Oh no you'll be just fine my old
friend.

650
01:19:47,146 --> 01:19:51,713
I've seen lesser men recover
from a lot worse buddy.

651
01:19:51,745 --> 01:19:53,346
Don't give up do you top?

652
01:19:53,379 --> 01:20:01,045
Never. Never. I may have
something to warm you up

653
01:20:01,079 --> 01:20:05,313
on the inside. When I was alone
I called for backup.

654
01:20:05,346 --> 01:20:09,045
Told them there were some Fritz
around our location and if

655
01:20:09,079 --> 01:20:12,146
we don't call them back with an
all clear you have permission

656
01:20:12,179 --> 01:20:17,011
to bomb the fuck out of this
goddamned graveyard. Yeah.

657
01:20:17,045 --> 01:20:24,045
You see, we die Jerry, they die.
No one gets the fucking gold.

658
01:20:24,079 --> 01:20:28,246
Let me get that last asshole,
top.

659
01:20:28,279 --> 01:20:31,046
Can't move my hand. Give me my
shooter.

660
01:20:31,079 --> 01:20:35,379
You got it.

661
01:20:35,413 --> 01:20:39,446
I got it. I got it.

662
01:20:40,646 --> 01:20:45,679
Good. I'll be right back.

663
01:20:45,712 --> 01:20:47,712
Don't be long.

664
01:21:46,213 --> 01:21:53,546
Jerry! God!

665
01:22:00,112 --> 01:22:05,745
Yeah not bad. Not bad at all.
You have succeeded in

666
01:22:05,779 --> 01:22:13,480
killing a broken regiment. Let's
discuss a truce.

667
01:22:13,513 --> 01:22:16,679
Marie always had a thing for a
man in uniform.

668
01:22:16,712 --> 01:22:19,213
No, that's not possible. I shot
him.

669
01:22:19,246 --> 01:22:24,645
A man who will fight for her.
Kill for her. Don't you see?

670
01:22:24,679 --> 01:22:31,279
She's using you. You must
practice extreme caution with

671
01:22:31,313 --> 01:22:36,779
the likes of Marie, major.
German, French, American

672
01:22:36,812 --> 01:22:42,480
she makes no distinction. What
she wants is simply to achieve

673
01:22:42,513 --> 01:22:48,612
her end. Then she will stab you
in the back or put a bullet

674
01:22:48,645 --> 01:22:56,645
between your eyes. If you're
lucky she'll shoot off-center.

675
01:22:58,645 --> 01:23:01,645
You're luck has run out Von
bruckner.

676
01:23:09,179 --> 01:23:12,179
It warms my heart to hear your
voice again.

677
01:23:20,213 --> 01:23:24,279
Last time I heard that beautiful
voice,

678
01:23:24,313 --> 01:23:26,579
you shot me in the face

679
01:23:26,612 --> 01:23:28,612
and left me for dead.

680
01:23:31,612 --> 01:23:33,679
I hate to break up this
beautiful reunion but

681
01:23:33,712 --> 01:23:35,545
I'm still here.

682
01:23:35,579 --> 01:23:41,179
You pull that trigger, we both
die. Marie.

683
01:23:41,213 --> 01:23:43,712
Look at the monster you have
made of me.

684
01:23:47,645 --> 01:23:51,279
The look on your face is more
painful than your bullet.

685
01:23:51,313 --> 01:23:54,679
There's something you two need
to know. I called in our

686
01:23:54,712 --> 01:24:00,079
location to air force control.
See, if they don't hear an all

687
01:24:00,112 --> 01:24:03,213
clear in about 4 minutes from
right now they've got orders

688
01:24:03,246 --> 01:24:07,413
to bomb this graveyard in to
next fucking year. So I say

689
01:24:07,446 --> 01:24:12,745
maybe we put down these guns. We
all get a little piece of

690
01:24:12,779 --> 01:24:17,979
that goddamned gold. We can go
on our merry little way.

691
01:24:24,346 --> 01:24:28,346
Well... what do you say? We got a
deal?

692
01:24:42,645 --> 01:24:46,645
That's a very wise decision
colonel.

693
01:24:51,479 --> 01:24:53,479
No more deals.

694
01:25:28,512 --> 01:25:31,512
Marie, we can be together again.

695
01:25:57,780 --> 01:25:59,780
Sugar 57 this is hound dog 3
over.

696
01:25:59,813 --> 01:26:02,012
This is sugar 57.

697
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:08,445
Hound dog 3 responding to
that... sugar 57, advise. Over.

698
01:26:08,479 --> 01:26:12,213
Roger hound dog 3. No cancel
command. Repeat, no

699
01:26:12,246 --> 01:26:16,246
cancel command. Go ahead and
deliver your payload. Over.

700
01:26:19,545 --> 01:26:21,545
I understand, Marie.

701
01:26:27,479 --> 01:26:30,479
We're coming up on that
position.

702
01:27:19,378 --> 01:27:23,378
Hound dog 3 has delivered
payload.

703
01:27:41,512 --> 01:27:45,512
Good shooting hound dog 3. Over.

704
01:29:04,813 --> 01:29:10,012
It is over, my angels. No one
will have it.

705
01:29:11,746 --> 01:29:13,746
It's done.
