Hey, you want to slow down
a little bit?

6
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:26,687
They're not slowing down.

Well, I don't remember
these bumps

8
00:00:28,658 --> 00:00:29,793
hurting my ass so much.

9
00:00:29,826 --> 00:00:32,164
Your ass is fine, Bubba.

10
00:00:32,197 --> 00:00:35,170
All right, it says
make a right on Kearny.

11
00:00:35,204 --> 00:00:37,676
Yeah. Are you gonna
let some app tell us

12
00:00:37,709 --> 00:00:39,412
how to do a car chase?

13
00:00:39,445 --> 00:00:41,784
These things are really
pretty accurate, you know,

14
00:00:41,817 --> 00:00:44,488

Car 717, what's your 20?

20
00:00:59,753 --> 00:01:01,657
I don't like that face.

21
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,159
This face?

22
00:01:03,193 --> 00:01:04,395
25 years working together,

23
00:01:04,428 --> 00:01:06,132
that face only means one thing:

24
00:01:06,165 --> 00:01:08,704
‐trouble and paperwork.
‐That's two things.

for six months.

All right, come on.

We gotta get this
wannabe gangster.

You plan on outrunning both
of Garrison's cars on foot?

32
00:01:24,536 --> 00:01:26,507
They're in the same traffic
we are.

33

You refused to communicate

no suspects at this time.

that SFPD will leave

no stone unturned in bringing
down the killer

167

in our city?"

00:17:24,254 --> 00:17:27,093
‐♪ I like taking my time ♪
‐(chuckles) ♪ Take it nice and easy... ♪

351
00:17:27,126 --> 00:17:30,534
You must be high.
Nobody shoots at me here.

352
00:17:30,567 --> 00:17:33,239
You know? I got businessmen
throwing money

353
00:17:33,272 --> 00:17:35,243
at me to buy weed.

354
00:17:35,276 --> 00:17:37,715
Why would I come
back to the SIU?

355
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:40,152
'Cause I'm asking.

356
00:17:40,186 --> 00:17:41,689
That's good.

357
00:17:41,723 --> 00:17:45,162
Did you work on that a lot?
"'Cause I ask you."

358
00:17:45,196 --> 00:17:47,601
I'm not going to do it
without you, partner.

359
00:17:47,635 --> 00:17:49,839
I wouldn't even pass
the drug screen, man.

360
00:17:49,872 --> 00:17:53,245
‐I'm high most of the time.
‐And so am I.

361
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:55,182
Thank you, Your Honor.

362
00:17:55,216 --> 00:17:56,418
See you next week.

363
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:58,255
Why don't you let me
worry about that.

364
00:17:58,289 --> 00:17:59,424
O‐Okay.

365
00:17:59,457 --> 00:18:02,230
Uh, is the mayor
a weekly customer?

366
00:18:02,263 --> 00:18:03,833
Sometimes twice a week.

367
00:18:03,867 --> 00:18:06,438
They can't make me work
with him, they really can't.

368
00:18:06,471 --> 00:18:07,608
What is this really about?

369
00:18:07,641 --> 00:18:09,411
He didn't follow procedures.

370
00:18:09,444 --> 00:18:11,181
It was handed to me
to investigate.

371
00:18:11,214 --> 00:18:13,285
I‐I reported what I found.

372
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:14,454
Does that make me a rat?

373
00:18:14,487 --> 00:18:16,793
‐Really?
‐Mm, doesn't not make you a rat.

374
00:18:16,826 --> 00:18:19,565
‐Okay.
‐Let's talk about...

375
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,136
Okay, if you say my father
again, I'm‐I'm gonna go.

376
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,840
I was gonna say "our father."

377
00:18:23,873 --> 00:18:25,677
Why don't you find
your own shrink

378
00:18:25,711 --> 00:18:28,115
and stop bugging your sister?

379
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,585
I like bugging you.

380
00:18:30,587 --> 00:18:33,459
(sighs) Bridges is in his 60s,
just like our father.

381
00:18:33,492 --> 00:18:36,599
Strong personality,
just like Dad.

382
00:18:36,633 --> 00:18:39,605
‐Confident, bordering on cocky.
‐Yeah.

383
00:18:39,639 --> 00:18:40,874
Classically handsome.

384
00:18:40,907 --> 00:18:43,780
What? That's not‐‐
When did I...

385
00:18:43,813 --> 00:18:44,849
I googled him.

386
00:18:44,882 --> 00:18:46,786
Listen, it sounds like this
is going to happen,

387
00:18:46,819 --> 00:18:49,357
so you can either whine about it
or you can deal with it.

388
00:18:51,194 --> 00:18:53,332
A Hellcat?

389
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:55,671
Órale, vato.
This is nice.

390
00:18:55,704 --> 00:18:58,208
Yeah, man,
I had to step up my game

391
00:18:58,242 --> 00:18:59,812
after you crushed the 'Cuda.

392
00:18:59,845 --> 00:19:02,618
Yeah, and getting the bad guys.

393
00:19:02,651 --> 00:19:05,757
You know, Joe,
we got hung out to dry.

394
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:09,632
I don't feel like we
deserve to go out that way.

395
00:19:09,665 --> 00:19:11,769
Kind of feeling like we're
getting a second chance to

396
00:19:11,803 --> 00:19:14,775
go back in and see if we can
make a difference.

397
00:19:14,809 --> 00:19:16,913
What do you say,
the dream team back together?

398
00:19:16,946 --> 00:19:19,685
‐One last assignment?
‐Dream team?

399
00:19:19,719 --> 00:19:23,425
(chuckles)
Yeah, I got your dream team.

400
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:28,703
(engine revving)

401
00:19:30,841 --> 00:19:34,347
Very nice.
So when do I get to drive it?

402
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:37,921
Uh, let me think. Um...

403
00:19:37,955 --> 00:19:39,357
Never.

404
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,763
What? I'll give you free weed.

405
00:19:41,796 --> 00:19:44,467
Oh, we got a welcome committee.

406
00:19:44,502 --> 00:19:46,471
‐Lena.
‐STEVEN: Bridges.

407
00:19:46,506 --> 00:19:48,275
Steven.

408
00:19:48,977 --> 00:19:50,814
Okay, this is
an unusual situation.

409
00:19:50,847 --> 00:19:52,985
Maybe we should go over
some protocols.

410
00:19:53,018 --> 00:19:55,991
Steven, you look exactly
the same, except for maybe

411
00:19:56,024 --> 00:19:57,828
you have a little more
gray hair, right?

412
00:19:57,861 --> 00:19:59,799
What? D‐Don't.

413
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:01,001
It's nice to see you, Joe.

414
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,370
Lena.

415
00:20:02,403 --> 00:20:03,907
‐Nice to see you.
‐This is Joe Dominguez,

416
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,244
‐Nash's partner.
‐Ah. Inspector Dominguez.

417
00:20:06,278 --> 00:20:09,217
I'm running SIU now,
so if there's, uh...

418
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,987
(sniffs) any...

419
00:20:11,021 --> 00:20:13,492
I'm sorry, are you high?

420
00:20:13,526 --> 00:20:15,797
Well, right now?

421
00:20:16,933 --> 00:20:18,970
Joe's with us
on a consulting basis,

422
00:20:19,003 --> 00:20:21,475
so he doesn't have to
undergo drug testing.

423
00:20:21,509 --> 00:20:25,282
‐Oh, but you do.
‐Oh, I'm happy to take the test.

424
00:20:25,316 --> 00:20:27,420
In fact, I'll give you
my sample right now.

425
00:20:27,453 --> 00:20:30,392
Before this turns into
a literal dick‐measuring moment,

426
00:20:30,426 --> 00:20:31,796
there's something
I need you to do.

427
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:35,837
Yeah, I know.
See the department shrink.

428
00:20:35,871 --> 00:20:39,612
Make sure I don't have any
skulls in my basement.

429
00:20:39,645 --> 00:20:42,016
Yeah, we moved them out
to the backyard so...

430
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:44,688
‐(shushing)
‐Oh.

431
00:20:46,592 --> 00:20:49,565
WOMAN:
I'm sorry, ma'am. We don't
investigate break‐ins anymore.

432
00:20:49,598 --> 00:20:51,001
(tranquil music playing)

433
00:20:51,034 --> 00:20:53,740
‐Have a blessed day, ma'am.
‐JOE: What is that music?

434
00:20:53,773 --> 00:20:56,445
‐Sounds like
my massage is ready.
‐Uh, Joe?

435
00:20:56,478 --> 00:20:58,917
I don't think we're
in Kansas anymore.

436
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,021
I don't think we're
on Earth anymore.

437
00:21:01,054 --> 00:21:02,356
‐Hey.
‐Huh?

438
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:03,425
One of my inspectors informed me

439
00:21:03,459 --> 00:21:04,795
you parked in my space.

440
00:21:04,829 --> 00:21:07,300
Wow, now that's some
solid detective work.

441
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,870
Is it really anyone's space?

442
00:21:08,903 --> 00:21:10,941
I mean,
in a world with no titles,

443
00:21:10,974 --> 00:21:13,345
doesn't the space belong
to pretty much everyone?

444
00:21:13,378 --> 00:21:16,451
‐Yeah.
‐What's going on
over here, Steven?

445
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:19,725
This is our IT hub.
Not only keeps us up to date

446
00:21:19,758 --> 00:21:21,328
with current crimes,
but allows us

447
00:21:21,361 --> 00:21:23,365
to predict how and when
future crimes may occur.

448
00:21:23,398 --> 00:21:27,641
Ah, predictive policing‐‐
the new packaging for profiling.

449
00:21:27,674 --> 00:21:29,645
You run this?

450
00:21:29,678 --> 00:21:31,749
Oh, no.
No, only one person at SIU

451
00:21:31,782 --> 00:21:34,320
‐really understands it.
‐Hey, dickwad.

452
00:21:36,091 --> 00:21:37,661
Keep your feet off my CPU.

453
00:21:37,694 --> 00:21:39,832
Now, her I can work with.

454
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,372
I'm Nash Bridges.

455
00:21:43,405 --> 00:21:45,744
Chloe Zane. We've met before.

456
00:21:46,813 --> 00:21:49,317
My uncle used to work here.
Nick Trevath.

457
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,021
No‐Neck Nick is your uncle?

458
00:21:51,054 --> 00:21:54,060
Oh, yeah, you used to come here
when you were a kid.

459
00:21:54,093 --> 00:21:56,331
‐Yeah.
‐You always wanted to
check out everyone's guns.

460
00:21:56,364 --> 00:21:57,801
I still like guns.

461
00:21:57,835 --> 00:21:59,939
(chuckles)
Hey, let me ask you a question.

462
00:21:59,972 --> 00:22:01,509
There used to be
a coffee machine

463
00:22:01,542 --> 00:22:02,945
right over here‐‐
where'd they move it?

464
00:22:02,978 --> 00:22:03,680
Gone.

465
00:22:03,713 --> 00:22:05,951
Steven brought in a cold press.

466
00:22:05,984 --> 00:22:08,322
Now we have green tea,
smoothies.

467
00:22:09,525 --> 00:22:11,696
Colon health.

468
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:14,835
‐I'll be right back.
‐Yeah, yeah.

469
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:16,371
I got to get some real coffee.

470
00:22:16,404 --> 00:22:19,077
So where's Ellie Tang
and, uh, Philly Morton?

471
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:21,883
‐I don't see them.
‐Working on a case.

472
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:24,087
They're investigating
a bank robbery.

473
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,824
(panting)

474
00:22:25,857 --> 00:22:27,794
There's something off
about that bank manager.

475
00:22:27,828 --> 00:22:30,099
Yeah, yeah, you see, uh,
his tan line?

476
00:22:30,132 --> 00:22:31,836
‐Yeah.
‐Where he used to wear a watch.

477
00:22:31,869 --> 00:22:33,438
Like he had to hock it recently.

478
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,975
Oh! Keep doing that.

479
00:22:35,009 --> 00:22:36,946
He's wearing
an expensive suit but...

480
00:22:36,979 --> 00:22:39,150
it's falling apart
and did you...

481
00:22:39,183 --> 00:22:41,121
did you see that racing form
in the trash can?

482
00:22:41,154 --> 00:22:44,695
Degenerate gambler.
Maybe he set up the robbery.

483
00:22:44,728 --> 00:22:46,566
Yeah, I'll get a subpoena
for his financials.

484
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:49,103
‐Oh!
‐Don't move! Oh!

485
00:22:49,137 --> 00:22:52,476

486
00:22:52,511 --> 00:22:54,682

Nicely done. Wow.

You gotta get the app.

494
00:23:11,047 --> 00:23:14,487
Yeah, I guess so.
You live around here?

495
00:23:14,521 --> 00:23:16,157
You want to know where I live?

496
00:23:16,191 --> 00:23:18,563
Oh, it's just
casual conversation.

497
00:23:18,596 --> 00:23:21,167
Just kind of running through
my coffee material.

498
00:23:21,201 --> 00:23:23,438
Oh, you have material.

499
00:23:24,775 --> 00:23:29,150
‐Let me guess. Lawyer.
‐Let me guess. Cop.

500
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,891
Now, why would you think
something like that?

501
00:23:32,925 --> 00:23:35,162
Shoulder holster‐‐
you're either a cop

502
00:23:35,195 --> 00:23:36,899
or you were there trying
to rob the trucks,

503
00:23:36,933 --> 00:23:38,903
and you don't seem
like a robber to me.

504
00:23:38,937 --> 00:23:41,174
‐You sure?
‐Yeah, I got a pretty good

505
00:23:41,207 --> 00:23:43,145
intuition about these sort
of things.

506
00:23:43,178 --> 00:23:44,615
(laughs)

507
00:23:44,648 --> 00:23:45,917
Well, this is me.

508
00:23:45,951 --> 00:23:47,688
I had to bounce out
for some real coffee.

509
00:23:47,721 --> 00:23:51,094
Got some changes
going on in my office.

510
00:23:51,127 --> 00:23:52,831
This is me, too.

511
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:56,438
You're a cop, that's how you
noticed the shoulder holster.

512
00:23:56,471 --> 00:23:58,776
I'm a psychiatrist.

513
00:23:59,912 --> 00:24:02,049
And this was going so well.

514
00:24:03,185 --> 00:24:06,592
I contract with SFPD

515

‐Uh‐huh.

522
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:25,229
Anything else I need to
know about you, Doc?

523
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:29,003
No, I think that's it for now.

524
00:24:31,909 --> 00:24:35,082
Oh, I've seen that look before.

525
00:24:35,115 --> 00:24:38,823
‐What?
‐Don't make a run
at the police shrink.

526
00:24:38,856 --> 00:24:42,229
Joe, it's 2021. You don't
"make a run" at women.

527
00:24:42,263 --> 00:24:44,668
‐Well, you keep repeating that.
‐Okay.

528
00:24:44,702 --> 00:24:46,972
Welcome back, bitches!

529
00:24:47,006 --> 00:24:50,112
Ellie, that's not really
an appropriate greeting.

530
00:24:50,145 --> 00:24:52,016
I said it with a "Z"
like bitchez.

531
00:24:52,049 --> 00:24:54,688
Yeah, I heard the "Z."
Come on.

532
00:24:54,722 --> 00:24:56,659
You really back, boss?

533
00:24:56,692 --> 00:24:58,996
‐For now, Philly.
‐STEVEN: Okay, everyone.

534
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,299
Yes, welcome back, Nash.

535
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,673
Uh, the Sunset murders.
Chloe, can you?

536
00:25:03,706 --> 00:25:06,111
First two bodies were found
in the Sunset District,

537
00:25:06,144 --> 00:25:08,281
but all the bodies found had
been moved from somewhere else.

538
00:25:08,315 --> 00:25:10,854
We're still looking
for a common M. O.

539
00:25:10,887 --> 00:25:12,256
outside the extreme violence
with which

540
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:13,158
the victims were killed.

541
00:25:13,191 --> 00:25:15,195
Now, I'm heading
to the districts

542
00:25:15,229 --> 00:25:16,799
that have been handling
the investigation

543
00:25:16,832 --> 00:25:18,101
to get their murder books.
Don't take

544
00:25:18,135 --> 00:25:20,940
any additional steps
till I get back. Got it?

545
00:25:20,974 --> 00:25:24,180
Oh, Dad, if I finish
my homework, can I watch TV?

546
00:25:24,213 --> 00:25:25,884
‐Please?
‐(laughs)

547
00:25:25,917 --> 00:25:28,589
You don't technically work here.
Remember that.

548
00:25:28,623 --> 00:25:29,691
Ooh, okay.

549
00:25:29,725 --> 00:25:30,827
You guys ever gonna get past

550
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,029
this Garrison beef?

551
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:33,165
‐What beef?
‐Putting that aside,

552
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,902
the fact that Trevor Garrison

553
00:25:34,935 --> 00:25:36,639
is up and walking around
is pretty screwed up.

554
00:25:36,672 --> 00:25:38,710
‐(phone beeps)
‐I have a feeling the clock

555
00:25:38,743 --> 00:25:40,580
is ticking on Mr. Garrison.

556
00:25:40,613 --> 00:25:42,283
You guys, we got fresh bodies.

557
00:25:42,316 --> 00:25:43,886
‐Huh?
‐Pier 45.

558
00:25:44,755 --> 00:25:47,126
‐(sighs)
‐You come with me.

559
00:25:48,663 --> 00:25:50,734
Comfy back there, Bubba?

560
00:25:50,767 --> 00:25:52,236
Well, I'm used
to riding shotgun.

561
00:25:52,269 --> 00:25:54,307
‐You know?
‐It's called chivalry.

562
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,144
You're all right with that,
aren't you?

563
00:25:56,177 --> 00:25:58,750
If it gets me out of
having to squeeze back there.

564
00:25:58,783 --> 00:25:59,918
(laughs)

565
00:25:59,952 --> 00:26:02,657
You don't mind my asking, but...

566
00:26:02,691 --> 00:26:04,862
beyond him being
a total lowlife,

567
00:26:04,895 --> 00:26:07,066
what's your beef with Garrison?

568
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:08,903
How much do you know about him?

569
00:26:08,936 --> 00:26:11,074
Party boy.
Criminal wheeler‐dealer.

570
00:26:11,107 --> 00:26:13,245
Drugs, weapons, whatever

571
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:15,282
‐he could make money on.
‐Yeah, that's right.

572
00:26:15,315 --> 00:26:18,656
He also deals in influence,
surrounds himself with

573
00:26:18,689 --> 00:26:21,662
underage women, and deals them
to important people for favors.

574
00:26:21,695 --> 00:26:25,737
One of those women is a girl
by the name of Brenna Montrose.

575
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:29,210
She ended up dead before
I could take Garrison down.

576
00:26:29,243 --> 00:26:31,849
Makes you wonder what rock
a guy like that crawled out

577
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:33,051
‐from under.
‐A rich one.

578
00:26:33,084 --> 00:26:34,688
Yeah, I know.

579
00:26:34,721 --> 00:26:38,261
Marvin Garrison's his dad‐‐
Silicon Valley royalty.

580
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:41,367
How you doing?
How's it going

581
00:26:41,401 --> 00:26:44,173
being a trans woman
on the force?

582
00:26:44,207 --> 00:26:46,344
It was tough for a bit.

583
00:26:46,377 --> 00:26:49,383
I'm not the first trans cop
in San Francisco,

584
00:26:49,417 --> 00:26:52,657
but folks knew who I was
because of my uncle.

585
00:26:53,258 --> 00:26:55,797
It took a while with people
getting on board with me

586
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:58,803
being Nick's niece
and not nephew.

587
00:26:58,836 --> 00:27:00,105
(chuckles)

588
00:27:00,139 --> 00:27:03,378
Yeah, I get that.
Well, my money's on you.

589
00:27:08,923 --> 00:27:10,793
(cameras clicking)

590
00:27:10,827 --> 00:27:13,398
‐(quiet chatter)
‐(engine revving)

591
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:14,935
(Joe grunts)

592
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:16,906
‐You all right
back there, Bubba?
‐Oh, that was really funny.

593
00:27:16,939 --> 00:27:19,010
Really funny.

594
00:27:19,043 --> 00:27:21,816
‐All right, what do we know?
‐First DOA‐‐

595
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:25,122
Alvin Cardoza, tourist, age 30.

596
00:27:25,155 --> 00:27:27,092
Next‐‐ Jeff Delancey,

597
00:27:27,126 --> 00:27:30,733
former MMA fighter, lived
across the bay in Emeryville.

598
00:27:30,767 --> 00:27:33,840
On probation for selling oxy.

599
00:27:33,873 --> 00:27:35,275
He pissed somebody off.

600
00:27:35,309 --> 00:27:37,179
That feels like
collateral damage.

601
00:27:37,213 --> 00:27:39,283
Somebody female.
We found some hair

602
00:27:39,317 --> 00:27:42,022
‐and a fingernail on the body.
‐Hmm.

603
00:27:42,056 --> 00:27:43,291
Thanks, Pete.

604
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,899
Maybe a lover's quarrel?

605
00:27:48,134 --> 00:27:49,437
I don't know, Joe.

606
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:52,042
Do you bring a ninja star
to a lover's quarrel?

607
00:27:52,076 --> 00:27:54,413
Hey, did it occur to you that‐‐
I don't know‐‐

608
00:27:54,447 --> 00:27:56,184
call me when you
got word of a new victim?

609
00:27:56,217 --> 00:28:00,392
You know, it occurred to me.
Then I moved on.

610
00:28:00,425 --> 00:28:01,529
(scoffs softly)

611
00:28:01,562 --> 00:28:03,866
I may have an opportunity to
get you close to Garrison.

612
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,170
‐Yeah?
‐He's throwing himself a party
later today

613
00:28:06,204 --> 00:28:07,373
for a new start‐up.

614
00:28:07,406 --> 00:28:09,176
A coder buddy
got me on the list.

615
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:10,880
‐Oh, take me as your plus‐one.
‐No, no, no, no, no.

616
00:28:10,914 --> 00:28:12,182
Absolutely not.

617
00:28:12,216 --> 00:28:13,786
Your orders
are to work this case

618
00:28:13,819 --> 00:28:16,859
‐and this case alone.
‐You like to hover, don't you?

619
00:28:16,892 --> 00:28:18,328
‐(whispers): Plus‐one.
‐You got it.

Listen, Garrison's gonna spot me
as soon as I get inside.

628
00:28:44,247 --> 00:28:45,950
I doubt I'll be here very long.

629
00:28:45,984 --> 00:28:48,355
So look around and see
what you can find.

630
00:28:48,388 --> 00:28:49,958
I know these type of parties.

631
00:28:49,992 --> 00:28:53,298
There's going to be security
but I'll poke around.

633

Ooh. Shouldn't you buy the guy
dinner first?

636
00:29:05,455 --> 00:29:08,061
‐Long time no see, Joe.
‐Hmm.

637
00:29:08,094 --> 00:29:10,499
Same lame jokes.
Heard you were back.

638
00:29:10,533 --> 00:29:13,038
Yeah, well,
bad news travels fast.

639
00:29:13,071 --> 00:29:15,510
Uh, what do you got on
the Sunset District murders?

640
00:29:15,543 --> 00:29:18,081
Oh, uh, no consistent
cause of death.

641
00:29:18,114 --> 00:29:20,987
Not much in common
with the victims.

642
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,358
Couple were tough guys,
hit man for the mob

643
00:29:23,391 --> 00:29:25,028
and an up‐and‐coming boxer.

644
00:29:25,062 --> 00:29:27,534
‐Uh‐huh. Who's he?
‐John Doe.

645
00:29:27,567 --> 00:29:30,405
Too early to say, but
I'm guessing victim number 12.

646
00:29:30,439 --> 00:29:32,510
‐Mm.
‐Based on his tattoos, I'd say

647
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:35,415
he's from Eastern Europe.
Cyrillic alphabet.

648
00:29:35,449 --> 00:29:39,056
He was damn near cut in half.

649
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:41,094
And we're talking serious force.

650
00:29:41,127 --> 00:29:42,329
Anything else?

651
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:44,801
Three victims
have syringe marks.

653
00:29:45,703 --> 00:29:48,876
No. Uh, victims
with syringe marks had

654
00:29:48,909 --> 00:29:52,116
elevated levels of adrenaline,
like off the charts.

655
00:29:52,149 --> 00:29:53,418
What does that mean?

Yeah, I hear you're back
on the force, huh?

672
00:30:32,162 --> 00:30:35,570
Yeah, it turns out that
the guy behind my suspension

673
00:30:35,603 --> 00:30:37,373
liked running around
with young girls.

674
00:30:37,406 --> 00:30:39,110
Speaking of,

675
00:30:39,143 --> 00:30:41,347
I look around here and
there's a bunch of young girls.

00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:44,387
Looks like it's almost
their bedtime. (chuckles)

677
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,491
It's a party, Nash.
I don't check IDs.

678
00:30:46,525 --> 00:30:50,032
‐But congratulations.
‐Thank you.

679
00:30:50,065 --> 00:30:53,405
Yeah, someone was leaning on
this commissioner

680
00:30:53,438 --> 00:30:55,342
to take me down.

681
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:57,379
Coincidentally,

682
00:30:57,413 --> 00:31:00,118
right around the time
of your arrest.

683
00:31:00,152 --> 00:31:02,356

00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,618

Is your father here?

686

'Cause I would love
to meet the guy

687
00:31:18,455 --> 00:31:20,927
that revolutionized
the Internet.

688
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,463
And then he moved on
to something else.

689
00:31:22,496 --> 00:31:25,302
It was something big,
something mind‐blowing.

690
00:31:25,335 --> 00:31:27,473
‐It was, uh...
‐I don't know.

691
00:31:27,507 --> 00:31:28,976
You'll have to ask him.

692
00:31:29,009 --> 00:31:31,214

693
00:31:31,247 --> 00:31:33,151
Nanobots, that's what it was.

694
00:31:33,184 --> 00:31:37,092
These tiny, tiny, tiny little
robots that get into your body

695
00:31:37,126 --> 00:31:39,564
and your bloodstream and they
find cancer cells and kill them.

696
00:31:39,598 --> 00:31:43,004
I mean, that's incredible.
So cool.

697
00:31:43,037 --> 00:31:44,608
You must be so proud.

698
00:31:44,641 --> 00:31:46,645
Well, he couldn't
make it today, Nash.

699
00:31:46,678 --> 00:31:48,582
At least you're here, right?

700
00:31:51,053 --> 00:31:52,624
Let's cut the crap.

701
00:31:53,659 --> 00:31:58,001
What I know‐‐
what everybody here knows‐‐

702
00:31:58,034 --> 00:32:01,608
is you're a twisted freak.
That's your business.

703
00:32:01,642 --> 00:32:05,015
But when you start
victimizing young women,

704
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:07,319
and one of them dies,

705
00:32:07,352 --> 00:32:09,056
‐that's my business.
‐Look,

706
00:32:09,089 --> 00:32:11,160
I was cleared
of all charges. Okay?

707
00:32:11,194 --> 00:32:14,968
Whatever brought you back here,

708
00:32:15,001 --> 00:32:16,605
I'm gonna get you.

709
00:32:16,638 --> 00:32:18,642
Sounds like a threat.

710
00:32:19,477 --> 00:32:22,684
Good. Good.

711
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,656

This is Nash Bridges.

719
00:32:48,034 --> 00:32:50,438
He's a cop.
And he was just on his way...

720
00:32:50,472 --> 00:32:52,042
I got this.

00:32:52,075 --> 00:32:54,514

00:33:10,478 --> 00:33:13,084
Want me to take a stab at it?

727
00:33:13,117 --> 00:33:15,623
You're another son
of a billionaire who couldn't

728
00:33:15,656 --> 00:33:18,696
live up to Daddy, so you decided
to become a screwup, too.

See Inspector Bridges out.

‐What are you doing in here?
‐I was looking for a bathroom.

743
00:33:57,372 --> 00:33:59,343
There's a bathroom
in the entry area.

744
00:33:59,376 --> 00:34:01,347
Not gender neutral.

745
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,117
This is a private home.

746
00:34:03,151 --> 00:34:04,486
All the bathrooms
are gender neutral.

747
00:34:04,521 --> 00:34:07,359

What a male thing to say.

748
00:34:07,392 --> 00:34:10,232

‐You're into his computer?
‐Yeah, I think so.

755
00:34:23,324 --> 00:34:25,863
I also found a slip
from a parking garage

756
00:34:25,896 --> 00:34:28,368
with writing on the back
underlined.

757
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:31,775
‐You stole that from Trevor?
‐It's not stealing if...

758
00:34:33,311 --> 00:34:35,683
‐Okay, yeah, I stole it.
‐(laughs)

759
00:34:35,716 --> 00:34:39,156
‐11 digits.
‐It could be a wiring number.

760
00:34:39,189 --> 00:34:42,630
I also saw a bill of lading‐‐
could be a plane or a ship.

761
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:44,634
But I had to bail
before I could find out.

762
00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:46,672
What would he be bringing in?

763
00:34:48,542 --> 00:34:50,613
Eastern European, huh?

764
00:34:50,646 --> 00:34:52,182
Okay, Joe, let's keep this

765
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,552
between you and me
for the moment.

766
00:34:53,585 --> 00:34:55,188
All right, thanks.

767
00:34:55,221 --> 00:34:57,426
Hey, I just got a call
from Garrison's lawyer.

768
00:34:57,459 --> 00:35:00,198
You went to that party
after you were ordered not to.

769
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:01,768
Well, it seemed like more
of a suggestion.

770
00:35:01,802 --> 00:35:04,239
And you had Chloe
hack into his computer?

771
00:35:04,273 --> 00:35:05,843
You don't think a guy
with a tech background

772
00:35:05,876 --> 00:35:07,580
is gonna notice and shut down
the back‐door program

773
00:35:07,614 --> 00:35:09,884
‐she put in?
‐She was acting under my orders.

774
00:35:09,918 --> 00:35:12,189
If you're gonna rat anybody out,
it'd better be me.

775
00:35:12,222 --> 00:35:14,828
Whoa, rat out? What are you,
in an '80s cop movie?

776
00:35:14,861 --> 00:35:16,598
You know,
you could learn a thing or two

777
00:35:16,632 --> 00:35:17,734
‐from '80s cop movies.
‐Okay.

778
00:35:17,767 --> 00:35:19,604
No one is ratting out anyone.

779
00:35:19,638 --> 00:35:21,608
I reminded Garrison's attorney
of Rule 570(c)

780
00:35:21,642 --> 00:35:23,746
of the Evidence Code
and he decided to back off

781
00:35:23,779 --> 00:35:25,448
on making any formal complaint.

782
00:35:25,482 --> 00:35:28,354
‐Right. 570(c).
‐Right.

783
00:35:28,388 --> 00:35:31,628
You know what the problem
with dinosaurs like you is?

784
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:33,932
You think
your way is the only way,

785
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:36,705
with the breaking rules
and cracking skulls.

786
00:35:39,476 --> 00:35:42,349
You accuse me of being
a dirty cop one more time,

787
00:35:42,382 --> 00:35:45,322
‐we're gonna have a problem.
‐Where have you been?

788
00:35:45,355 --> 00:35:46,692
We already have a problem.

789
00:35:46,725 --> 00:35:48,629
If I didn't
know you better, Steven,

790
00:35:48,662 --> 00:35:50,231
I'd say you were
looking for a fight.

791
00:35:50,265 --> 00:35:53,772
(chuckles) No, no. No, no, no.
I‐I can't fight you.

792
00:35:53,806 --> 00:35:55,710
Oh, department protocol?

793
00:35:55,743 --> 00:35:58,782
‐Because I'd hurt you.
‐Oh, right.

794
00:35:58,816 --> 00:36:01,655
‐Mm.
‐Man of my advanced years,

795
00:36:01,688 --> 00:36:04,259
just wouldn't stand a chance
against a young...

796
00:36:04,293 --> 00:36:05,896
(people gasping)

797
00:36:06,965 --> 00:36:08,167
I owed you that.

798
00:36:10,238 --> 00:36:13,779
Whoa. You okay?
You need medical assistance?

799
00:36:20,526 --> 00:36:24,400
(exhales, grunting)

800
00:36:24,433 --> 00:36:26,505
Oh, you wanna dance?
I thought you wanted to fight.

801
00:36:26,538 --> 00:36:30,278
This is capoeira, a Brazilian
form of martial arts.

802
00:36:31,347 --> 00:36:32,850
Oh, I know capoeira.

803
00:36:33,986 --> 00:36:35,890
Yeah, but do you know Muay Thai?

804
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,327
(people gasping)

805
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,434
Oh, God.

806
00:36:41,467 --> 00:36:42,737
My money is on Nash.

807
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:45,509
Stay down,
you're embarrassing yourself.

808
00:36:45,543 --> 00:36:47,947
(both panting)

809
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:50,686
Scuse me.

810
00:36:53,024 --> 00:36:54,293
(people oohing)

811
00:36:59,571 --> 00:37:01,307
PHILLY:
Hey!

812
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,512
We got something on what Chloe
found at the party.

813
00:37:03,545 --> 00:37:05,750
Unless you two assholes
want to keep fighting

814
00:37:05,783 --> 00:37:07,419
like a bunch of kids.

815
00:37:07,452 --> 00:37:10,659
Okay. (grunts)

816
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:15,468
‐Come on!
‐Now we're even.

817
00:37:15,503 --> 00:37:17,339
We're really not.

818
00:37:20,011 --> 00:37:21,548
So I ran that 11‐digit number.

819
00:37:21,581 --> 00:37:23,317
It's not a wiring number

820
00:37:23,351 --> 00:37:24,721
or an international
phone number,

821
00:37:24,754 --> 00:37:25,823
and it doesn't appear to be

822
00:37:25,856 --> 00:37:27,794
any kind of discernible code.

823
00:37:27,827 --> 00:37:29,463
You broke up
a perfectly good fight

824
00:37:29,496 --> 00:37:31,535
to tell me your supercomputer
is stumped?

825
00:37:31,568 --> 00:37:33,739
We ran the other side
of the card that Chloe

826
00:37:33,772 --> 00:37:35,743
‐found at the party.
‐Parking lot ticket?

827
00:37:35,776 --> 00:37:37,012
Yeah, it was from
Golden Gate Park,

828
00:37:37,045 --> 00:37:39,016
so we scanned every camera
in the park

829
00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:41,320
for the three hours
after the card was issued.

830
00:37:41,353 --> 00:37:43,391
Some sick shit going on
out there.

831
00:37:43,424 --> 00:37:45,328
We've already met Mike Trumanik.

832
00:37:45,361 --> 00:37:46,832
American‐born,
grew up in Ukraine.

833
00:37:46,865 --> 00:37:49,369
That's probably where he
met Garrison‐‐ facilitator

834
00:37:49,403 --> 00:37:51,575
in Kiev. He did about
18 months for gunrunning.

835
00:37:51,608 --> 00:37:53,478
According to Interpol,
he does business

836
00:37:53,512 --> 00:37:55,950
with the highest bidder‐‐
the Taliban, Boko Haram.

837
00:37:55,983 --> 00:37:58,287
Who's the other suit?

838
00:37:58,321 --> 00:38:00,893
‐Commissioner Ron Peters.
‐Ron Peters,

839
00:38:00,926 --> 00:38:02,897
who signed the papers that
pushed Nash off the force?

840
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:04,868
Just got put in charge
of the Port of San Francisco.

841
00:38:04,901 --> 00:38:06,705
(computer beeping)

842
00:38:06,738 --> 00:38:09,476
No. No. No.

843
00:38:10,646 --> 00:38:12,517
‐No.
‐MAN: This happening to you?

844
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,521
WOMAN:
Yeah, everything's gone black.

845
00:38:14,554 --> 00:38:17,425
(electronic blipping)

846
00:38:17,459 --> 00:38:18,962
We've been hacked.

847
00:38:28,615 --> 00:38:29,784
All right, everybody,
listen up. I need all your devices‐‐
cell phones, laptops, iPads.

848
00:38:29,818 --> 00:38:31,588
That's work and personal.

849
00:38:31,621 --> 00:38:33,692
Uhp, uhp, no, I don't want
to hear it, you guys.

850
00:38:33,725 --> 00:38:34,994
I don't care how
you're gonna send

851
00:38:35,028 --> 00:38:36,932
your TikToks or your Instagrams.

852
00:38:36,965 --> 00:38:39,704
This is a matter
of national security.

853
00:38:39,737 --> 00:38:41,440
MAN:
Any cell phones...

854
00:38:41,473 --> 00:38:44,112
Nash, I thought I was clear
that you were to

855
00:38:44,146 --> 00:38:47,620
stay away from Garrison
and focus on these murders.

856
00:38:47,653 --> 00:38:49,022
Lena, don't you think

857
00:38:49,056 --> 00:38:50,860
it's a little bit
coincidental that

858
00:38:50,893 --> 00:38:53,097
I see Garrison yesterday
and we get hacked today?

859
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:56,136
‐No.
‐Come on,
you gotta let me look

860
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:59,511
into the Garrison murder,
'cause I believe strongly

861
00:38:59,544 --> 00:39:00,713
that his murder

862
00:39:00,746 --> 00:39:03,117
and the Sunset killings
are related.

863
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,888
You sure this Garrison thing
isn't just you

got you thrown off the force?

Mm, not entirely.

866
00:39:11,535 --> 00:39:15,041
Fine, but I'm going to need your
help with the rest of SIU.

867
00:39:15,074 --> 00:39:17,045
Most of them are trained
in data mining,

868
00:39:17,078 --> 00:39:19,617
and without that, they're
a little out of their element.

869
00:39:19,651 --> 00:39:21,955
Come on, Joe and I
can take these TikTokers

870

into old‐school sleuths.

871
00:39:24,426 --> 00:39:26,765
Okay, fine, but first: shrink.

Nash, you said
you were gonna go.

874
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,843
Go.

875
00:39:32,877 --> 00:39:35,983
Okay. Just tell me
what's on your mind.

876
00:39:36,016 --> 00:39:40,593
Um, hmm.
I don't want to be here.

You're resisting. Let's talk.

879
00:39:44,433 --> 00:39:46,738
I'm resisting 'cause
I don't wanna be here.

880
00:39:46,771 --> 00:39:48,942
The SIU has been hacked and...

881

I got people getting killed
all over my city.

882

Just be open and honest.

886
00:40:04,473 --> 00:40:07,647
You knew who I was the other day
at the coffee truck, didn't you?

887
00:40:09,684 --> 00:40:11,688
I did.

Fair enough, I apologize.

890
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,635
Well, why don't you just
sign off on me now

891
00:40:18,669 --> 00:40:20,606

00:46:13,143 --> 00:46:14,814
Shut up, Vladimir.

1038
00:46:15,849 --> 00:46:17,987
That's‐‐ I didn't‐‐ (sighs)

1039
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:19,557
I‐I'm sorry, that's‐‐ I‐‐

1040
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:22,796
You bring me to this
and I don't... (sighs)

1041
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:25,468
Look, what happened
when you docked here?

1042
00:46:25,501 --> 00:46:28,575
Mr. Garrison called,
said to send the men out.

1043
00:46:28,608 --> 00:46:31,881
That he'd call with more
instructions about the trawler.

1044
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:32,983
And did he?

1045
00:46:34,419 --> 00:46:37,091
‐Hmm.
‐You did good, Vladdy.

1046
00:46:37,125 --> 00:46:39,195
‐Good job.
‐I can go?

1047
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:40,498
Oh, hell no.

1048
00:46:40,532 --> 00:46:42,101
You assaulted a cop.

1049
00:46:42,135 --> 00:46:43,103
But you said.

1050
00:46:43,137 --> 00:46:45,274
Yeah, I know. We lied.

1051
00:46:45,308 --> 00:46:47,412
It's going around.

1052
00:46:47,445 --> 00:46:49,482
Stand up, turn around.

1053
00:46:49,517 --> 00:46:51,554
We'll put in a good word
for you, but, uh,

1054
00:46:51,587 --> 00:46:53,490
(quietly): call me later
and we'll talk about...

1055
00:46:53,525 --> 00:46:55,161
‐You know?
‐Listen,

1056
00:46:55,194 --> 00:46:58,835
I guess you pulling your gun
wasn't not a good idea.

1057
00:46:58,868 --> 00:47:00,438
I'm touched.

1058
00:47:00,471 --> 00:47:02,108
Now, was that so hard?

1059
00:47:02,141 --> 00:47:03,545
More than you can imagine.

1060
00:47:03,578 --> 00:47:06,383
‐Oh, you'll get used to it.
‐(scoffs): Okay.

1061
00:47:06,416 --> 00:47:08,020
‐Is it true?
‐As we speak,

1062
00:47:08,053 --> 00:47:10,559
Trevor Garrison is on his way
into federal custody.

1063
00:47:10,592 --> 00:47:12,963
He'll be charged with three
counts of illegal trafficking.

1064
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:15,468
It's not for what he did to
Brenna Montrose, but it'll do.

1065
00:47:15,501 --> 00:47:17,405
Chloe found some things
on Garrison's computer,

1066
00:47:17,438 --> 00:47:19,442
a couple of satellite images.

1067
00:47:19,476 --> 00:47:21,614
One of the pinball museum
down at Fisherman's Wharf

1068
00:47:21,647 --> 00:47:24,920
and also of the abandoned arms
depot out at Treasure Island.

1069
00:47:24,954 --> 00:47:27,225
There were bodies found
near both of those places.

1070
00:47:27,258 --> 00:47:28,595
‐NASH: Yeah.
‐So Trevor Garrison

1071
00:47:28,628 --> 00:47:30,131
was involved
with the Sunset killings.

1072
00:47:30,164 --> 00:47:33,237
We got that son of a bitch
on a no‐bail hold.

1073
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:36,343
We figure a rich guy like Trev,
if he spends a few hours

1074
00:47:36,376 --> 00:47:37,613
in federal lockup,

1075
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:39,449
maybe it'll motivate him
to talk.

1076
00:47:39,482 --> 00:47:43,123
In the meantime, we still gotta
work the Sunset killings case.

1077
00:47:43,157 --> 00:47:44,627
We gotta go old‐school.

1078
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:48,067
What that means is trusting
yourselves, trusting each other.

1079
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:50,204
But most of all,
trusting your instincts.

1080
00:47:50,237 --> 00:47:53,945
It's about seeing what you want.

1081
00:47:55,381 --> 00:47:58,253
And going after it
with a laser focus.

1082
00:47:58,287 --> 00:48:00,559
You know, good police work,
it's not complicated.

1083
00:48:00,592 --> 00:48:04,667
It's about reacting to
new information in the moment.

1084
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:07,138
Christine is my sister.

1085
00:48:07,171 --> 00:48:09,342
(others clearing throats)

1086
00:48:11,714 --> 00:48:13,618
Now, that's definitely
new information.

1087
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:16,256
You going to be okay
talking to Garrison?

1088
00:48:16,289 --> 00:48:18,995
‐Yeah, why wouldn't I be?
‐'Cause he ruined your life?

1089
00:48:19,028 --> 00:48:21,299
‐No, Steven, you ruined my life.
‐Okay.

1090
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:22,936
‐Is she really your sister?
‐Yes.

1091
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:25,207
‐Like biological?
‐Yes.

1092
00:48:25,241 --> 00:48:27,211
I mean, 'cause she doesn't
look anything like you.

1093
00:48:27,245 --> 00:48:29,683
‐She has a different last name.
‐She's divorced.

1094
00:48:29,717 --> 00:48:33,290
‐Oh, that means she's single.
‐Not for you.

1095
00:48:33,323 --> 00:48:34,994
What...?

1096
00:48:35,027 --> 00:48:37,465
I just heard from the warden
in federal lockup.

1097
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:40,505
Don't tell me.
Garrison lawyered up

1098
00:48:40,539 --> 00:48:42,108
and we're not invited.

1099
00:48:42,141 --> 00:48:44,179
He's dead.

1100
00:48:45,347 --> 00:48:46,651
What?

1101
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:55,301
Garrison was alone five minutes
after he was booked. When they came back in
to check on him,

1102
00:48:55,334 --> 00:48:58,006
‐he'd hung himself.
‐I know Garrison.

1103
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,612
There is no way
he killed himself.

1104
00:49:00,645 --> 00:49:03,150
Joe's got some informants
over in federal lockup.

1105
00:49:03,183 --> 00:49:04,553
Why don't you go with him,
go over there

1106
00:49:04,587 --> 00:49:06,289
‐and see what you can find out.
‐I will.

1107
00:49:06,323 --> 00:49:09,597
I'm going to go have a slightly
more difficult conversation.

1108
00:49:15,207 --> 00:49:18,147
Been expecting a visit
like this for years.

1109
00:49:19,315 --> 00:49:21,319
Doesn't make it any easier.

1110
00:49:24,425 --> 00:49:27,599
Do you have any idea
who killed my son?

1111
00:49:29,169 --> 00:49:33,210
(sighs) My partner talked
to some people in lockup.

1112
00:49:33,243 --> 00:49:37,084
The killing was likely carried
out by a Chinese street gang.

1113
00:49:37,118 --> 00:49:38,187
Oh, God.

1114
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:40,625
‐Yeah.
‐Trevor.

1115
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:45,602
They were paid for it, so...

1116
00:49:45,635 --> 00:49:48,207
If Trevor had any enemies,
now would be a good time to...

1117
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,211
He was running around
with this group

1118
00:49:50,244 --> 00:49:52,215
that he had fallen in with...

1119
00:49:52,248 --> 00:49:54,753
when he was abroad and...

1120
00:49:54,787 --> 00:49:57,158
well, one of them came to me
with a business idea

1121
00:49:57,191 --> 00:49:58,695
and I sent him away.

1122
00:49:58,728 --> 00:50:02,536
‐Mike Trumanik?
‐Yeah, exactly.

1123
00:50:04,573 --> 00:50:09,282
Sorry. It's a biotech deal
that I'm looking at.

1124
00:50:09,315 --> 00:50:11,486
I'm sorry‐‐ NDAs.

1125
00:50:11,521 --> 00:50:14,727
The Defense Department
insists on secrecy.

1126
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:18,233
Sorry, I'm a... I'm a snoop.
Force of habit.

1127
00:50:18,267 --> 00:50:21,239
Do you, uh, have any children,
Inspector?

1128
00:50:21,273 --> 00:50:23,343
Yeah.

1129
00:50:23,377 --> 00:50:25,381
I have a daughter.

1130
00:50:25,414 --> 00:50:30,024
She used to be a cop.
Now she's in the military.

1131
00:50:31,159 --> 00:50:32,563
Army intelligence.

1132
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:37,205
I begged Trevor to find
something of his own.

1133
00:50:38,641 --> 00:50:42,215
Growing up the son
of the great Marvin Garrison.

1134
00:50:43,317 --> 00:50:46,256
I've been living in
my own shadow for years.

1135
00:50:46,289 --> 00:50:50,264
I wrote code 30 years ago
that changed the way

1136
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:54,640
information is processed.
But since then?

1137
00:50:54,673 --> 00:51:00,518
Ah. World has changed,
Inspector Bridges.

1138
00:51:00,552 --> 00:51:03,691
Change with it,
or you get left behind.

1139
00:51:03,725 --> 00:51:07,566
(sighs)
Again, I'm sorry.

Feel good today.

Why? Hitting the streets,
just like the old days?

1151
00:51:37,358 --> 00:51:39,863
Nah. Because you're trying
to sleep with his sister

1152
00:51:39,897 --> 00:51:41,600
‐and he knows it.
‐Okay,

1153

‐It's just a social call.
‐It's a social club, isn't it?

1163
00:52:11,527 --> 00:52:13,163
You bring your son with you?

1164

(laughs)
Oh, God, no. No, no.

1165
00:52:16,504 --> 00:52:17,806
We just happen to work together.

‐I'm his boss.
‐Oh, yeah.

1167

‐He's my boss.
‐I am.

1168
00:52:21,947 --> 00:52:24,485
Listen, Teddy,
we got a little situation.

1169
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:27,258
We have some questions.

1170
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:31,299
See, this is what's wrong
with the younger generation.

1171
00:52:31,333 --> 00:52:33,370
Always in a rush.

1172
00:52:33,403 --> 00:52:34,907
No respect for the old ways.

1173
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:37,779
You're singing my song, Teddy.

1174
00:52:37,813 --> 00:52:41,186
But with all due respect, we are
in a little bit of a rush.

1175
00:52:41,219 --> 00:52:43,256
There was a guy
that got murdered down

1176
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:47,198
‐in county lockup today.
‐I heard he killed himself.

1177
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:48,668
That hasn't been
released to the public.

1178
00:52:48,701 --> 00:52:50,137
How do you know that?

1179
00:52:50,939 --> 00:52:54,479
Your friend comes into my club,
insults me?

1180
00:52:54,513 --> 00:52:56,650
Yeah, I'm sorry, Teddy.

1181
00:52:56,684 --> 00:53:01,359
Um, he's got an excuse‐‐
he's an asshole.

1182
00:53:01,393 --> 00:53:02,662
Excuse me?

1183
00:53:02,696 --> 00:53:05,234
But he's got a chance
of outgrowing that.

1184
00:53:05,267 --> 00:53:08,173
You're a criminal.
That's for life.

1185
00:53:09,342 --> 00:53:11,747
(grunting)

1186
00:53:15,354 --> 00:53:18,293
Next time you come,
have a warrant.

1187
00:53:18,326 --> 00:53:20,765
That's a good idea.

1188
00:53:21,934 --> 00:53:24,205
That wasn't losing your cool?

1189
00:53:24,238 --> 00:53:25,809
I mean, I‐I appreciate you
sticking up for me.

1190
00:53:25,842 --> 00:53:28,681
‐I really do, but...
‐I wasn't sticking up for you.

1191
00:53:28,715 --> 00:53:30,552
True, he called you an asshole.

1192
00:53:30,585 --> 00:53:32,656
STEVEN:
Okay.

1193
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:40,939
You look more confused
than usual.

1194
00:53:40,972 --> 00:53:43,578
You want to tell me
what's going on here?

1195
00:53:43,611 --> 00:53:46,851
(sighs) Teddy can't be seen
giving us anything,

1196
00:53:46,884 --> 00:53:49,590
so Nash takes a shot at Teddy,

1197
00:53:49,623 --> 00:53:51,994
Teddy's guys take a couple shots
at Nash.

1198
00:53:52,027 --> 00:53:55,835
Teddy maintains his cred.
Now they can talk.

1199
00:53:56,971 --> 00:53:59,208
It's Chinatown, Jake.

1200
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:01,914
What?

1201
00:54:02,783 --> 00:54:03,985
You okay?

1202
00:54:04,018 --> 00:54:05,822
Yeah, I was expecting
the first one,

1203
00:54:05,855 --> 00:54:07,926
but the second one kind of

‐Hey, man, you dragged my ass

in here before you

1399

Trevor Garrison.

1400

1405
01:04:16,977 --> 01:04:21,052
I'm in a bar, guy comes up,
offers me a fight off the books.

1406
01:04:22,287 --> 01:04:25,060
Said there'd be a bonus if I
put the guy in the hospital.

1407
01:04:25,661 --> 01:04:27,965
Next fight, he upped the ante.

1408

Said there'd be an extra 50
if I, you know...

1409
01:04:30,971 --> 01:04:32,307
Killed your opponent.

1410
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:36,082
He said if I told anybody,
he'd kill me.

1411
01:04:36,115 --> 01:04:40,524
And anyone I ever cared about.
And that's all I know.

Well, tough guy, you killed him.

1418
01:05:02,501 --> 01:05:05,273
You can tell Nash
you didn't kill this guy.

1419
01:05:05,306 --> 01:05:07,477
Well, what was
the cause of death?

1420
01:05:07,512 --> 01:05:10,584
Well, I thought it was
sudden cardiac death.

1421
01:05:10,618 --> 01:05:13,122
The brain's electrical system
causes the heart to shut down.

1422

You thought it was
cardiac arrest?

1423
01:05:15,193 --> 01:05:18,600
Well, the heart did shut down,
but it had outside help.

1424

01:05:24,344 --> 01:05:26,148
I got lucky and found it
in McDaniels'

1427
01:05:26,182 --> 01:05:28,687
‐cerebral cortex.
‐How did it get there?

1428
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:31,960
Injected into his bloodstream
and made its way up.

1429
01:05:36,035 --> 01:05:37,505
What does this chip do?

1430
01:05:37,538 --> 01:05:40,443
(chuckles) Well, that's
for you geniuses to figure out.

1431
01:05:40,477 --> 01:05:44,118
It was directed to the amygdala,
which controls emotions.

I need to borrow this chip.

1433

‐Look, we just need to bring...
