5
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,300
-There he is.

6
00:00:24,334 --> 00:00:26,302
Oh, he has on
his yellow bandana.

7
00:00:26,336 --> 00:00:28,304
How handsome.

8
00:00:28,338 --> 00:00:31,617
Okay. So, Herman, let's talk
about what we're doing here.

9
00:00:31,652 --> 00:00:34,655
We want to start to find
what we call the heartbeat

10
00:00:34,689 --> 00:00:36,553
for the character
that you are.

11
00:00:38,555 --> 00:00:39,832
Okay.

12
00:00:39,867 --> 00:00:43,698
Can you transfer and fall
back in the air?

13
00:00:43,733 --> 00:00:46,080
Yes, you can.

14
00:00:46,115 --> 00:00:48,255
The world of dance closed down.

15
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:51,361
The pandemic totally closed
the opportunities

16
00:00:51,396 --> 00:00:53,398
for dancers to work,
dances to get made,

17
00:00:53,432 --> 00:00:55,641
dances to get presented.

18
00:00:55,676 --> 00:00:58,679
Maybe I can connect a dancer

19
00:00:58,713 --> 00:01:01,785
with another dancer
through Zoom,

20
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,374
and we can create
a single thing,

21
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:07,550
and we can pull us together
even though we're miles apart.

22
00:01:09,276 --> 00:01:11,450
Dancers have to work every day.

23
00:01:11,485 --> 00:01:13,728
I have to work every day.

24
00:01:13,763 --> 00:01:15,834
How are we going to do this?

25
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:43,827
-One thing you can always
expect from choreographer

26
00:01:43,862 --> 00:01:47,624
Twyla Tharp,
that is the unexpected.

27
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:50,420
-Twyla Tharp has transformed
American dance

28
00:01:50,455 --> 00:01:52,836
as both a performer
and choreographer.

29
00:01:52,871 --> 00:01:55,908
Her work transcends traditional
definitions of the medium,

30
00:01:55,943 --> 00:01:59,360
combining elements
of ballet and modern dance.

31
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:08,956
-Maria!

32
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,165
How are you?
-I'm good.

33
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,373
How are you?

34
00:02:12,408 --> 00:02:14,272
-Good morning, Benjamin.

35
00:02:14,306 --> 00:02:18,345
Would like to tell you
just a bit about this project.

36
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:20,278
-Hi.

37
00:02:20,312 --> 00:02:22,659
-Misty! Girl!

38
00:02:22,694 --> 00:02:25,938
-Whenever I see Twyla's name
come up on my phone,

39
00:02:25,973 --> 00:02:28,665
I'm just like, I don't know
what to expect,

40
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,427
but I know
it's going to be exciting.

41
00:02:31,461 --> 00:02:32,669
-Let's see if we can bring

42
00:02:32,704 --> 00:02:34,395
St. Petersburg
and L.A. together.

43
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,467
People -- We can bring
people together.

44
00:02:37,502 --> 00:02:41,195
This is about introducing
the four main characters

45
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:44,888
in a tale called
"The Princess and the Goblin."

46
00:02:44,923 --> 00:02:49,341
It's going to be a reduction
of the entire novel,

47
00:02:49,376 --> 00:02:52,758
less than three minutes,
in which the Princess Irene

48
00:02:52,793 --> 00:02:56,417
is going to go
into the underworld.

49
00:02:56,452 --> 00:02:58,488
That has a species of people

50
00:02:58,523 --> 00:03:00,904
that have been
in quarantine forever,

51
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:04,529
and she is going to help them
find a way to be released.

52
00:03:04,563 --> 00:03:07,428
So, Maria, the character
that you are playing,

53
00:03:07,463 --> 00:03:09,499
her name is Irene.

54
00:03:09,534 --> 00:03:11,605
The girl is the hero.

55
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:15,022
The character you are playing
is the Queen.

56
00:03:15,056 --> 00:03:17,024
-Oh.
-Ah, of course.

57
00:03:17,058 --> 00:03:20,717
The people who live
with you in the underworld

58
00:03:20,752 --> 00:03:22,581
are in quarantine.

59
00:03:22,616 --> 00:03:27,345
They've been in quarantine
for centuries, for epochs,

60
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:29,830
and they, too,
would like to get out.

61
00:03:29,864 --> 00:03:30,934
How long have you been
in quarantine?

62
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:34,386
I think I'm going into
my ninth week.

63
00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:38,287
We're making a piece in two
dimensions and four squares.

64
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:41,497
We don't have a stage,
but we have a virtual platform.

65
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:44,603
Let's get it on YouTube,
and let's share it with people.

66
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:54,475
I had just graduated
from college,

67
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,857
and I wanted space to work in

68
00:03:56,891 --> 00:03:59,584
'cause I was going
to be a dancer.

69
00:03:59,618 --> 00:04:03,484
There was a loft
on Franklin Street.

70
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,762
I went downtown
and found the street,

71
00:04:05,797 --> 00:04:06,936
but not the building.

72
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,352
There was a man seated
on the stoop.

73
00:04:09,387 --> 00:04:10,836
His name was Bob Huot.

74
00:04:10,871 --> 00:04:12,597
Said, "Are you looking
for a loft?"

75
00:04:12,631 --> 00:04:15,910
I said, "Yeah."
He said, "Okay, upstairs."

76
00:04:15,945 --> 00:04:17,395
That was on the fourth floor.

77
00:04:17,429 --> 00:04:20,743
I started up.
He was on the third floor.

78
00:04:20,777 --> 00:04:24,022
The rent on this floor
was 50 bucks a month.

79
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:27,888
That sounded good to me.

80
00:04:27,922 --> 00:04:29,924
And there was nothing --
literally nothing --

81
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:32,548
below Canal Street
but artists in these spaces,

82
00:04:32,582 --> 00:04:36,793
which were illegal.

83
00:04:36,828 --> 00:04:39,520
Became aware of other people
in the area

84
00:04:39,555 --> 00:04:41,971
who had lofts
and who were working

85
00:04:42,005 --> 00:04:45,630
and who were far more
established than I.

86
00:04:45,664 --> 00:04:48,805
I had graduated in art history,

87
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,705
but these guys
were practicing art.

88
00:04:51,739 --> 00:04:53,845
That's very different.

89
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:55,985
Suddenly, you're in front of,
you know, the guys

90
00:04:56,019 --> 00:04:59,920
who are going to determine
the history of American art.

91
00:04:59,954 --> 00:05:02,336
That's, "Whoa!"

92
00:05:02,371 --> 00:05:03,579
I was a kid.

93
00:05:03,613 --> 00:05:06,098
I didn't have any
tangible foundation.

94
00:05:06,133 --> 00:05:08,031
These people had
all done something.

95
00:05:08,066 --> 00:05:11,000
They were all moving on
from somewhere they had been.

96
00:05:11,034 --> 00:05:13,865
I was still looking
for a place to start.

97
00:05:17,558 --> 00:05:19,733
While I was still
at Barnard College,

98
00:05:19,767 --> 00:05:22,011
I had also been studying dance.

99
00:05:22,045 --> 00:05:25,704
I took ballet class
with your Igor Schwezoff.

100
00:05:25,739 --> 00:05:27,879
I was taking classes
at Cunningham Studio.

101
00:05:27,913 --> 00:05:31,400
I was taking classes
at the Graham Studio.

102
00:05:31,434 --> 00:05:32,849
Paul Taylor was in class.

103
00:05:32,884 --> 00:05:34,955
He was just starting a company,

104
00:05:34,989 --> 00:05:37,820
and I just managed to get
into one of his rehearsals.

105
00:05:37,854 --> 00:05:39,856
Marched in, sat on the floor
in the front of the room,

106
00:05:39,891 --> 00:05:41,617
he said, "Who are you?"
and I said, "My name is Twyla.

107
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:43,929
I'm gonna be dancing here."

108
00:05:43,964 --> 00:05:46,104
He was so shocked,
he didn't throw me out.

109
00:05:51,109 --> 00:05:53,698
I was a very unpleasant
company member.

110
00:05:53,732 --> 00:05:56,770
I would have fired me
long before he did.

111
00:05:56,804 --> 00:05:58,875
I felt the work
was not challenging.

112
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:01,533
I didn't feel he was
challenging himself.

113
00:06:01,568 --> 00:06:02,672
And I told him so.

114
00:06:02,707 --> 00:06:03,846
He just looked at me and said,

115
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,504
"Well, maybe you better go out
and try trial by fire,

116
00:06:06,538 --> 00:06:08,713
and I said, "Okay."

117
00:06:08,747 --> 00:06:12,164
So, I would just try
to do a dance,

118
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:15,685
which was called "Tank Dive."

119
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,757
It was called "Tank Dive"
because I always said, "Okay.

120
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:22,658
Your chances of becoming
successful are about the same

121
00:06:22,692 --> 00:06:24,763
as somebody jumping off
a hundred-foot pole

122
00:06:24,798 --> 00:06:26,972
into a thimble of water.
Good luck.

123
00:06:27,007 --> 00:06:30,079
We'll call it 'Tank Dive.'"

124
00:06:30,113 --> 00:06:32,530
I used no music in "Tank Dive"

125
00:06:32,564 --> 00:06:35,187
and for every piece during
the next five years.

126
00:06:35,222 --> 00:06:37,880
What I needed to learn was,

127
00:06:37,914 --> 00:06:41,953
"What could movement
communicate?"

128
00:06:41,987 --> 00:06:43,748
Not movement to music.

129
00:06:43,782 --> 00:06:46,613
Because if I do a phrase
to happy music,

130
00:06:46,647 --> 00:06:48,477
everybody would be happy.

131
00:06:48,511 --> 00:06:52,032
If I do the same phrase to sad,
they'll all be sad.

132
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:54,483
What if I just do the phrase?

133
00:06:54,517 --> 00:06:56,588
What will they feel?

134
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:03,699
-I gave myself stuff to do
that nobody else was doing.

135
00:07:03,733 --> 00:07:05,148
That was the point.

136
00:07:05,183 --> 00:07:07,841
And nobody else was standing
still on relevÃ©

137
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,843
for a minute and a half.

138
00:07:17,057 --> 00:07:18,748
It did what
it was supposed to do --

139
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:21,544
it launched a career,
like the diving board

140
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:24,029
that you use to dive
down into the water.

141
00:07:24,064 --> 00:07:25,928
And then you got to
learn how to swim.

142
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:33,798
The next piece, "Stride,"
was done in what would

143
00:07:33,832 --> 00:07:36,594
now be called
an alternative space,

144
00:07:36,628 --> 00:07:38,803
which was a rooftop in Brooklyn.

145
00:07:38,837 --> 00:07:40,667
I don't remember
how we snuck in.

146
00:07:40,701 --> 00:07:42,220
It must've been
over a fire escape or something

147
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,222
to get in.

148
00:07:53,852 --> 00:07:56,579
I was not trying to make
the world's greatest dance.

149
00:07:56,614 --> 00:07:59,237
I was just trying to find
a starting place

150
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:02,136
that had enough
substance to evolve.

151
00:08:13,872 --> 00:08:16,323
-Ah.
There you go.

152
00:08:16,357 --> 00:08:18,118
We're together now.

153
00:08:18,152 --> 00:08:21,155
Okay, guys, so here's
what we're going to do.

154
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:24,538
-When the pandemic started,
I had no idea what to expect.

155
00:08:24,573 --> 00:08:26,160
I want to say I was surprised

156
00:08:26,195 --> 00:08:27,783
that Twyla came callin',
but at the same time, I wasn't.

157
00:08:27,817 --> 00:08:29,888
-And three, and...

158
00:08:29,923 --> 00:08:33,098
-I've been working with her
for, I think, 22 years.

159
00:08:33,133 --> 00:08:36,239
There's never something
that could hold Twyla back

160
00:08:36,274 --> 00:08:38,621
from creating or working.

161
00:08:38,656 --> 00:08:39,760
It feeds her.

162
00:08:39,795 --> 00:08:42,004
It's something
that she has to do.

163
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:45,248
-Herman, you remember,
you've been trying to sleep,

164
00:08:45,283 --> 00:08:48,976
but you've been woken up
because stone shoes here

165
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:52,083
is stomping around
and keeping you awake,

166
00:08:52,117 --> 00:08:54,879
and you go over
to listen at the wall.

167
00:08:54,913 --> 00:08:57,744
You're going to go over
to downstage left,

168
00:08:57,778 --> 00:09:01,023
and you're going to pull him
through the wall.

169
00:09:01,057 --> 00:09:03,612
Okay.
Yes.

170
00:09:03,646 --> 00:09:07,098
That is a spatial difficulty.

171
00:09:07,132 --> 00:09:08,858
-The way she approaches
choreography,

172
00:09:08,893 --> 00:09:10,722
it's not about the steps.

173
00:09:10,757 --> 00:09:12,137
It's more than that.

174
00:09:12,172 --> 00:09:14,726
-She's gonna yank you in to --

175
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:15,900
That's it, right.

176
00:09:15,934 --> 00:09:17,142
Good.
There, we got it.

177
00:09:17,177 --> 00:09:18,385
-When she comes into a studio
and says,

178
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:20,387
"No, you do this
because of that,

179
00:09:20,421 --> 00:09:21,975
and because of that,
you do that,

180
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:23,908
and then all of this
is combined,

181
00:09:23,942 --> 00:09:26,980
and this is the movement,"
and you're like, "Wow."

182
00:09:27,014 --> 00:09:28,360
And then you try
to do the movement like that,

183
00:09:28,395 --> 00:09:31,812
and it's so difficult.

184
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:34,090
Like, she's not sitting
and telling you what to do.

185
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:37,266
Like, she stands up
and goes into the space

186
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,717
and does it.

187
00:09:39,751 --> 00:09:41,270
And then you try to do it.

188
00:09:41,304 --> 00:09:42,823
And you're like,
"Oh, my back went out."

189
00:09:44,687 --> 00:09:46,102
-We're all trying
to keep up with her

190
00:09:46,137 --> 00:09:48,104
is the moral of the story.

191
00:09:48,139 --> 00:09:50,244
-I've just pulled him
through the wall.

192
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:52,868
I'm gonna give him --
unh! -- a big yank,

193
00:09:52,902 --> 00:09:55,905
and I'm gonna take him
around the space,

194
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,425
and I'm going
to throw him upstage.

195
00:09:58,459 --> 00:09:59,737
Make a little more work

196
00:09:59,771 --> 00:10:01,842
about leveraging
him around the corner.

197
00:10:01,877 --> 00:10:04,327
Make more movement for yourself
going through.

198
00:10:04,362 --> 00:10:05,363
That's it!

199
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:06,329
Now give it a hoist.

200
00:10:06,364 --> 00:10:07,676
Good!

201
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:10,195
Right.
Yes!

202
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,266
-The idea was so new

203
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:15,891
just in terms of, like,
entering into this new state,

204
00:10:15,925 --> 00:10:17,444
you know,
where everything's virtual,

205
00:10:17,478 --> 00:10:19,101
everything's on Zoom.

206
00:10:19,135 --> 00:10:22,207
And even in this stage
of her career, in her life,

207
00:10:22,242 --> 00:10:27,109
she's setting the standard
for where dance is evolving to.

208
00:10:32,183 --> 00:10:36,670
-I, early on, felt the need
to have companionship

209
00:10:36,705 --> 00:10:37,982
in the dancing

210
00:10:38,016 --> 00:10:40,191
and also counterpoint
in the dancing.

211
00:10:40,225 --> 00:10:42,055
That requires
more than yourself.

212
00:10:44,402 --> 00:10:46,749
We began as all women

213
00:10:46,784 --> 00:10:49,269
because we didn't want
to be told what to do.

214
00:10:51,961 --> 00:10:54,101
We work together
as women can work together,

215
00:10:54,136 --> 00:10:54,999
which is very tight.

216
00:10:55,033 --> 00:10:57,864
We put a man in,
the chemistry changes.

217
00:11:00,763 --> 00:11:04,215
The "Bunch of Broads,"
we called ourselves.

218
00:11:04,249 --> 00:11:06,942
But I worked hard to have
diversity, you might say,

219
00:11:06,976 --> 00:11:10,048
in the group,
both culturally diverse

220
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,810
but also physically diverse.

221
00:11:12,844 --> 00:11:14,915
Graciela,
her movement is just huge.

222
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,468
She could fling really wide.

223
00:11:16,503 --> 00:11:18,332
She was very, very strong.

224
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:25,201
Sheela was amazingly fast --
small, compact, very rhythmic.

225
00:11:25,236 --> 00:11:27,169
Theresa was lanky
and a different

226
00:11:27,203 --> 00:11:29,136
kind of weight in her body.

227
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,314
Rose was a classically
trained dancer.

228
00:11:34,348 --> 00:11:35,764
She was very large.

229
00:11:35,798 --> 00:11:37,800
She was almost
6 foot on point.

230
00:11:37,835 --> 00:11:40,182
She auditioned for
the New York City Ballet,

231
00:11:40,216 --> 00:11:43,737
but Balanchine thought
she was too tall.

232
00:11:43,772 --> 00:11:45,014
I didn't care how tall she was.

233
00:11:45,049 --> 00:11:46,222
She was a great dancer.

234
00:11:49,847 --> 00:11:52,125
Margery
was a true lyric dancer.

235
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:54,368
There were no gaps
in her movement.

236
00:11:56,336 --> 00:11:57,544
Sara was just luscious.

237
00:11:57,578 --> 00:11:59,511
Sara was just great.
She was --

238
00:11:59,546 --> 00:12:01,928
Everything she did
was right all the time.

239
00:12:01,962 --> 00:12:04,068
She was a natural dancer.

240
00:12:04,102 --> 00:12:07,830
So we were
a well-balanced group.

241
00:12:07,865 --> 00:12:10,971
We had very little
rehearsal space.

242
00:12:11,006 --> 00:12:12,973
And in order to get
more work time,

243
00:12:13,008 --> 00:12:14,112
we just started
working in the park.

244
00:12:19,877 --> 00:12:21,948
I started thinking
about distances,

245
00:12:21,982 --> 00:12:24,157
and I started thinking about,
"Oh, somebody who's close,

246
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:26,159
you do this kind of movement,
and you'll see it.

247
00:12:26,193 --> 00:12:27,816
But when they're 20 feet away,
you do that,

248
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:28,713
you're not going to see that.

249
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,266
You got to do
this kind of movement.

250
00:12:30,301 --> 00:12:32,061
And if they're 40 feet away,
and then if they're

251
00:12:32,096 --> 00:12:34,339
a hundred yards down there,
you got to do this."

252
00:12:48,181 --> 00:12:49,320
Here are all these people,

253
00:12:49,354 --> 00:12:51,253
they're having their lives,
they're walking around,

254
00:12:51,287 --> 00:12:53,324
they don't have to buy tickets
and sit down.

255
00:12:53,358 --> 00:12:58,916
You're interjecting
yourself into their reality.

256
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,883
There were football games
going through us

257
00:13:00,918 --> 00:13:02,851
and horseback people,
and, you know,

258
00:13:02,885 --> 00:13:05,060
babies are squalling
and bicycles

259
00:13:05,094 --> 00:13:06,095
are going through the dance.

260
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,373
And you're saying,
"Yeah, we're just the same

261
00:13:08,408 --> 00:13:09,961
as a bicycle or --

262
00:13:09,996 --> 00:13:12,619
We're just an element
in the park."

263
00:13:12,653 --> 00:13:15,139
That's not what
theatrical dance is.

264
00:13:15,173 --> 00:13:17,106
Theatrical dance is separated --

265
00:13:17,141 --> 00:13:20,213
here's the audience,
here's the event.

266
00:13:20,247 --> 00:13:22,146
We were merged.

267
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:37,092
-And there was a very long,
slow adagio at the end

268
00:13:37,126 --> 00:13:38,472
that went on forever,

269
00:13:38,507 --> 00:13:40,198
and the sun
is setting behind it.

270
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:41,855
And that's how
you knew it was over,

271
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,305
because the energy
had run out.

272
00:13:49,207 --> 00:13:50,553
"Medley" had been seen

273
00:13:50,588 --> 00:13:54,350
by a curator
named Henry Geldzahler,

274
00:13:54,385 --> 00:13:58,907
who was assembling a show at
the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

275
00:13:58,941 --> 00:14:03,256
And he invited us to be included
in that show.

276
00:14:11,574 --> 00:14:14,267
He put dance in the middle
of painting and sculpture.

277
00:14:18,996 --> 00:14:21,377
We were doing work that,
you know,

278
00:14:21,412 --> 00:14:25,174
fit into spaces
that were not staged spaces.

279
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:26,900
Stages were for
ballet companies.

280
00:14:26,935 --> 00:14:28,626
I was not in that tradition.

281
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,111
I was in the tradition,
"Just get out there and do it."

282
00:14:50,613 --> 00:14:54,169
We had no obligations
other than to dance

283
00:14:54,203 --> 00:14:57,137
as well as we could dance.

284
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:04,489
And that ended.

285
00:15:04,524 --> 00:15:09,011
Everybody began to need money.

286
00:15:09,046 --> 00:15:12,463
Sheela and Graciela's
green cards ran out,

287
00:15:12,497 --> 00:15:13,671
and they couldn't renew.

288
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,984
Theresa got married
and moved away.

289
00:15:16,018 --> 00:15:18,607
Margery got married
and moved away.

290
00:15:18,641 --> 00:15:20,471
We couldn't earn an income.

291
00:15:20,505 --> 00:15:21,610
We couldn't develop a life.

292
00:15:21,644 --> 00:15:23,301
We didn't have a studio.

293
00:15:23,336 --> 00:15:25,303
I felt like we'd been building
something,

294
00:15:25,338 --> 00:15:28,168
but obviously a future
in dance at this point

295
00:15:28,203 --> 00:15:29,411
was out of the question.

296
00:15:29,445 --> 00:15:32,345
So I quit.

297
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:35,589
There was nothing
more to be done.

298
00:15:35,624 --> 00:15:37,212
And I left New York.

299
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:46,428
Okay, Misty, this was right on
the beginning of your one.

300
00:15:46,462 --> 00:15:49,431
And one, two, four.

301
00:15:51,122 --> 00:15:54,263
Two.

302
00:15:54,298 --> 00:15:57,197
Three.

303
00:15:57,232 --> 00:15:59,199
Four.

304
00:16:01,477 --> 00:16:04,066
And pull him across.

305
00:16:04,101 --> 00:16:05,792
And take him around.

306
00:16:05,826 --> 00:16:07,794
And give him a big push.

307
00:16:07,828 --> 00:16:09,451
Good. Thank you.

308
00:16:09,485 --> 00:16:11,384
Okay. That's the idea.

309
00:16:11,418 --> 00:16:15,526
I thought actually you were
one count late pulling him in.

310
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,631
-Okay.
-What I don't know

311
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,806
is whether you guys
have got a time lag.

312
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,188
-Can we just count?
-Yes, totally.

313
00:16:22,222 --> 00:16:24,293
One.

314
00:16:24,328 --> 00:16:26,295
See? Stop. Stop.

315
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:30,575
My one is one, one
before your one.

316
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,163
No, I don't think it's us,
Misty.

317
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:34,441
I think it is the connection.

318
00:16:34,476 --> 00:16:37,720
So, listen, guys, this
technology will make us crazy,

319
00:16:37,755 --> 00:16:40,482
but you know what?
We'll fight our way through it.

320
00:16:40,516 --> 00:16:44,796
There is a discipline to taking
a more restricted arena

321
00:16:44,831 --> 00:16:47,765
and learning lessons
and finding potential there,

322
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,422
which is what the Zoom is.

323
00:16:49,456 --> 00:16:53,288
The zoom is very restrictive.

324
00:16:53,322 --> 00:16:54,841
I've always been my best tool.

325
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:59,052
I work whenever and however
I need to

326
00:16:59,087 --> 00:17:00,467
so that
I've been able to evolve

327
00:17:00,502 --> 00:17:04,747
a lot of material on myself.

328
00:17:04,782 --> 00:17:07,474
Dances come from dancing.

329
00:17:07,509 --> 00:17:09,752
I don't make a dance.

330
00:17:09,787 --> 00:17:13,756
I dance, and then something
starts to make sense.

331
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,689
A dance will evolve,

332
00:17:15,724 --> 00:17:18,313
if the idea is good enough.

333
00:17:20,522 --> 00:17:23,697
I try not to get emotional
about the past

334
00:17:23,732 --> 00:17:26,321
because you were so much younger
and the body

335
00:17:26,355 --> 00:17:28,461
was so much more malleable,

336
00:17:28,495 --> 00:17:30,359
and you just can't
allow yourself

337
00:17:30,394 --> 00:17:32,085
to go back there and feel that.

338
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,605
So you have to go back there
and look at it

339
00:17:34,639 --> 00:17:36,883
for the lessons
that you can use.

340
00:17:43,165 --> 00:17:47,273
By 1970, I had married
Bob Huot,

341
00:17:47,307 --> 00:17:51,725
the gentleman on the stoop
at 104 Franklin Street.

342
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,763
Bob Huot and I moved to a farm

343
00:17:54,797 --> 00:18:00,424
four hours north of the city
in order to start a family.

344
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:03,910
I was pregnant.

345
00:18:03,944 --> 00:18:06,292
I started working
on the farmhouse.

346
00:18:06,326 --> 00:18:07,776
I started doing chores.

347
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:11,331
But soon Rose came up
and then Sarah came

348
00:18:11,366 --> 00:18:13,437
because they didn't
want to stop dancing

349
00:18:13,471 --> 00:18:15,439
any more than I did.

350
00:18:15,473 --> 00:18:18,925
We're dancers.
You don't just stop dancing.

351
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:24,379
We had been too embedded
in the work we were doing

352
00:18:24,413 --> 00:18:27,313
to just let it go.

353
00:18:27,347 --> 00:18:30,419
So soon we were working again
on a piece called "The Fugue."

354
00:18:33,215 --> 00:18:36,356
One, two, three, four, three,
boom, one, one, two, three,

355
00:18:36,391 --> 00:18:39,325
four, three, two, one, one, two,
three, four, three, two, one,

356
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:41,844
one, two, three, four,

357
00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:43,639
one, two, three,
one, two, three, four,

358
00:18:43,674 --> 00:18:45,400
three, two, one,
one, two, three,

359
00:18:45,434 --> 00:18:47,609
four, five, six, seven, eight.

360
00:18:49,576 --> 00:18:52,614
I also had a studio
in the attic.

361
00:18:52,648 --> 00:18:54,823
And I was able there to set up

362
00:18:54,857 --> 00:18:57,308
a secondhand
Panasonic video deck

363
00:18:57,343 --> 00:18:59,414
that I had brought
from the city.

364
00:18:59,448 --> 00:19:02,934
And the project that I started
was to record movement

365
00:19:02,969 --> 00:19:08,181
that I could do at different
stages of the pregnancy safely.

366
00:19:08,216 --> 00:19:10,287
So, how does a body change?

367
00:19:10,321 --> 00:19:11,736
This was going to be
an opportunity

368
00:19:11,771 --> 00:19:13,911
to learn
some interesting lessons.

369
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,568
There was no other way to do it.

370
00:19:18,364 --> 00:19:21,505
Bob, my husband, was not happy.

371
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:26,475
He was not happy to have
his family life disrupted.

372
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:31,411
And that time was being shared
between his family-to-be

373
00:19:31,446 --> 00:19:33,931
and the work
that was being done.

374
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:38,004
I thought these two
could fit together.

375
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:40,662
He felt they could not.

376
00:19:43,837 --> 00:19:46,702
Jesse was born.

377
00:19:46,737 --> 00:19:49,981
Then I went in a totally
different direction after that.

378
00:19:50,016 --> 00:19:51,880
I went back to New York.

379
00:19:51,914 --> 00:19:56,678
We changed course
to start developing

380
00:19:56,712 --> 00:19:59,370
a mode of engaging an audience

381
00:19:59,405 --> 00:20:00,682
that would pay the bills

382
00:20:00,716 --> 00:20:02,994
because now we had diapers
to buy.

383
00:20:05,031 --> 00:20:07,758
Jess was our companion,

384
00:20:07,792 --> 00:20:13,004
and Jess was a part of our lives
and part of our work.

385
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,868
He'd be in there on the floor
crawling,

386
00:20:14,903 --> 00:20:17,837
and he was always in the studio
with us.

387
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,533
-I was aware early
on that my parents

388
00:20:24,568 --> 00:20:28,468
were very different
than everybody else's parents.

389
00:20:28,503 --> 00:20:30,263
They believed in their art

390
00:20:30,298 --> 00:20:35,579
as being the primary focus
of their existence.

391
00:20:35,613 --> 00:20:40,377
Mom and Dad were on
very different wavelengths.

392
00:20:40,411 --> 00:20:43,069
-Bob and I were divorced.

393
00:20:43,103 --> 00:20:46,521
And he was on the farm.
I was working in New York.

394
00:20:48,937 --> 00:20:52,423
I became the sole breadwinner.

395
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:55,288
And it was a change of heart

396
00:20:55,323 --> 00:20:58,360
that was an artistic change
of heart

397
00:20:58,395 --> 00:21:02,053
as well as
a romantic change of heart

398
00:21:02,088 --> 00:21:06,920
because I was no longer willing
to be in the avant garde.

399
00:21:06,955 --> 00:21:10,855
Now we were building dances
that were going to be performed

400
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,857
for paying audiences.

401
00:21:12,892 --> 00:21:16,482
Up until this point, our
performances had all been free.

402
00:21:18,898 --> 00:21:20,865
We used to be,
in the avant garde,

403
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,696
ragged hair hanging down
however,

404
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,663
blue jeans are torn,
so on and so forth.

405
00:21:25,698 --> 00:21:28,459
We started realizing

406
00:21:28,494 --> 00:21:32,532
if we are going to become
a commercially viable entity,

407
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:34,396
we have to put on a show.

408
00:21:34,431 --> 00:21:38,331
And it was suggested that our
hair needed to have attention.

409
00:21:38,366 --> 00:21:40,471
I would go and set the example.

410
00:21:40,506 --> 00:21:42,991
I went to Sassoon,
which was a big deal in dance

411
00:21:43,025 --> 00:21:45,373
because we all
did the bun-head thing

412
00:21:45,407 --> 00:21:46,891
or we had long hair or whatever.

413
00:21:46,926 --> 00:21:49,480
And I had this hair
that was flying around.

414
00:21:49,515 --> 00:21:52,414
We got costumes.

415
00:21:52,449 --> 00:21:58,144
"Eight Jelly Rolls" featured me
in a role as a silent clown.

416
00:22:04,944 --> 00:22:07,602
Those early pieces
were kind of tribute pieces

417
00:22:07,636 --> 00:22:09,120
to American theatrics.

418
00:22:11,675 --> 00:22:13,953
In vaudeville,
women did not do

419
00:22:13,987 --> 00:22:15,955
the stuff Buster Keaton did.

420
00:22:15,989 --> 00:22:17,784
So, I said, "Well,
I can do that stuff.

421
00:22:17,819 --> 00:22:19,614
"Okay, guys can do it,
I can do it.

422
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,823
I can do a pratfall."

423
00:22:35,423 --> 00:22:38,978
I didn't want to be stopped
by any of the sort of clichÃ©s

424
00:22:39,012 --> 00:22:41,083
about what women could do
or couldn't do.

425
00:22:46,848 --> 00:22:48,574
And it was a sort of progression

426
00:22:48,608 --> 00:22:53,579
from austere, kind of in-silence
pieces to show-biz pieces.

427
00:22:56,961 --> 00:23:03,761
Show the folks a good time.

428
00:23:03,796 --> 00:23:05,522
-The pieces we do now
are nothing like

429
00:23:05,556 --> 00:23:08,145
the pieces we did then,

430
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:11,631
but they're all rooted in the
same, you know, integrity

431
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:13,875
and intelligence
and desire to work

432
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:17,430
and find out what dancing is
and what we wanted to do.

433
00:23:17,465 --> 00:23:20,916
-I made the fastest, hardest
dancing I could think of.

434
00:23:20,951 --> 00:23:22,608
There are some
very literal gestures.

435
00:23:22,642 --> 00:23:26,059
I mean, for example,
the banjo solo that I do

436
00:23:26,094 --> 00:23:30,823
starts out with hitching a ride
down the street.

437
00:23:30,857 --> 00:23:33,688
How do you do?
I'm knocking off my foot.

438
00:23:33,722 --> 00:23:35,621
Oh, yeah, there it goes.
Oh, I see it. I see it.

439
00:23:35,655 --> 00:23:37,726
I still need a ride.
How are you?

440
00:23:37,761 --> 00:23:39,694
I'm washing my hands
of this whole mess.

441
00:23:39,728 --> 00:23:40,902
Oh, I hate you a lot.

442
00:23:40,936 --> 00:23:43,214
I'm bowing down here,
this cello.

443
00:23:43,249 --> 00:23:44,768
I am shooting craps.

444
00:23:44,802 --> 00:23:46,804
Shame on you.
You're a bad person.

445
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:48,668
Traffic goes this way.
Hello out there.

446
00:23:48,703 --> 00:23:50,774
Again, I will polish the mirror,

447
00:23:50,808 --> 00:23:52,569
and then bouncing a basketball.

448
00:23:52,603 --> 00:23:55,779
And then this is my notion of
some Jewish something or other.

449
00:23:55,813 --> 00:23:57,988
And then we have this
black bottom number put in

450
00:23:58,022 --> 00:24:00,059
because it is called
"The Black Bottom Stomp."

451
00:24:00,093 --> 00:24:03,200
And then we go
to the knock-kneed sheriff,

452
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:06,065
and the last
little dirty movement

453
00:24:06,099 --> 00:24:08,826
that we can put in before it
comes to fast diagonal.

454
00:24:08,861 --> 00:24:10,828
And that all happens
at this tempo.

455
00:24:10,863 --> 00:24:12,761
-One, two, two, two.

456
00:24:49,729 --> 00:24:51,662
Sara and Rose were the nucleus.

457
00:24:51,697 --> 00:24:53,802
We were all women.

458
00:24:53,837 --> 00:24:57,116
Then suddenly we got a man.

459
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:00,533
Ken Rinker was
the first man with us,

460
00:25:00,568 --> 00:25:01,879
and he went into
"The Bix Pieces."

461
00:25:01,914 --> 00:25:05,642
Why?
Because he was really good.

462
00:25:05,676 --> 00:25:08,748
We had now grown to five.

463
00:25:08,783 --> 00:25:11,026
We had an administrator.

464
00:25:11,061 --> 00:25:12,683
We were called
Twyla Tharp Dance.

465
00:25:12,718 --> 00:25:15,272
We were a company.

466
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:19,345
At one point, I had one of the
dancers do a phrase of movement

467
00:25:19,379 --> 00:25:21,312
in a sort of modern dancing
kind of way,

468
00:25:21,347 --> 00:25:23,970
and the other one is doing it
totally classically.

469
00:25:24,005 --> 00:25:27,077
It was that section that
Bob Joffrey saw.

470
00:25:27,111 --> 00:25:29,010
And Joffrey looked at it
and said, "Holy cow.

471
00:25:29,044 --> 00:25:30,701
She could make a ballet."

472
00:25:30,736 --> 00:25:32,876
So Joffrey came to me
after the "Bix"

473
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:35,637
and said, "Would you make a
ballet for my company?"

474
00:25:35,672 --> 00:25:39,158
Ready?
And, ah, one, two,

475
00:25:39,192 --> 00:25:41,919
four, one.

476
00:25:41,954 --> 00:25:43,714
Four and one.

477
00:25:43,749 --> 00:25:45,613
I said, "Well, shall I start
with 'Swan Lake'?"

478
00:25:45,647 --> 00:25:47,269
And he nicely said,

479
00:25:47,304 --> 00:25:49,755
"No, I think it'd be good
to do something shorter first."

480
00:25:51,722 --> 00:25:54,760
So then I said, "Okay,
I will do a ballet,

481
00:25:54,794 --> 00:25:57,383
"but I need to bring
my dancers in as well

482
00:25:57,417 --> 00:25:59,937
"because I can't just
abandon them.

483
00:25:59,972 --> 00:26:02,699
"Sara and Rose here -- we've
been together for 10 years.

484
00:26:02,733 --> 00:26:05,287
Ken just came in.
You'll take us all."

485
00:26:05,322 --> 00:26:07,013
He agreed.

486
00:26:07,048 --> 00:26:09,982
"Okay, fine, it'll be
two companies working together."

487
00:26:10,016 --> 00:26:11,777
"It'll be a modern company
with a ballet company.

488
00:26:11,811 --> 00:26:13,675
That's fine. We'll do that."

489
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:17,714
And I said, "And I think
I'll use The Beach Boys."

490
00:26:17,748 --> 00:26:20,302
This is a ballet company, right?

491
00:26:20,337 --> 00:26:21,821
We don't do The Beach --

492
00:26:21,856 --> 00:26:23,892
He did. He said, "Okay."

493
00:26:28,276 --> 00:26:31,935
-The Beach Boys is straight out,
hard-core pop music.

494
00:26:31,969 --> 00:26:34,178
And I put it
into the ballet world.

495
00:26:34,213 --> 00:26:37,319
And I'm sure that
the classicists, if you will --

496
00:26:37,354 --> 00:26:39,701
"Oh, my God. Can this be?"

497
00:26:39,736 --> 00:26:41,738
And I didn't think of it
from that point of view

498
00:26:41,772 --> 00:26:44,810
because I thought that
the Joffrey ballet audience

499
00:26:44,844 --> 00:26:48,745
wanted something with energy
and something that was fresh.

500
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:52,300
And The Beach Boys
had a vitality

501
00:26:52,334 --> 00:26:55,027
and a "Let's get going here,"
you know?

502
00:26:55,061 --> 00:26:57,823
Like, all of their songs
are about motion.

503
00:27:04,277 --> 00:27:08,074
-When I was riding the subways
and was seeing the graffiti

504
00:27:08,109 --> 00:27:09,938
painted on the sides
of the subways --

505
00:27:09,973 --> 00:27:11,181
this was just happening.

506
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:12,976
These guys were just coming out.

507
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:15,081
I was like, "Whoa,
that is something else.

508
00:27:15,116 --> 00:27:16,911
We need that behind us."

509
00:27:16,945 --> 00:27:19,292
Because "Deuce Coupe"
turned out to be

510
00:27:19,327 --> 00:27:21,950
about the sort of spirit
and adventure of teenagers.

511
00:27:21,985 --> 00:27:24,884
And that seemed to me
the perfect background.

512
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:35,343
-These guys -- they were
wanted by the police.

513
00:27:35,377 --> 00:27:36,965
We had to lock them up upstairs

514
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,105
so that they wouldn't
get arrested between shows.

515
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,969
They were outlaws.

516
00:27:47,907 --> 00:27:49,909
-When I started to work
in the Joffrey,

517
00:27:49,944 --> 00:27:52,740
for the men it was maybe
a bit challenging.

518
00:27:52,774 --> 00:27:55,121
They were not accustomed
to having women

519
00:27:55,156 --> 00:27:57,779
tell them what to do
or where to go.

520
00:27:57,814 --> 00:28:01,300
Two, three, four.
Oops!

521
00:28:01,334 --> 00:28:02,888
The men in his company

522
00:28:02,922 --> 00:28:05,787
really didn't want to hear
from a female choreographer.

523
00:28:05,822 --> 00:28:06,995
And a number of them
went to Bob Joffrey

524
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,514
and said,
"We don't want to do this."

525
00:28:08,548 --> 00:28:09,549
And Bob said, "That's too bad.

526
00:28:09,584 --> 00:28:14,520
Get back in there and do it,
or you're fired."

527
00:28:14,554 --> 00:28:18,489
I learned from "Deuce Coupe and
from working with Bob Joffrey

528
00:28:18,524 --> 00:28:21,320
that I could do it.

529
00:28:21,354 --> 00:28:26,428
For a young person to have a man
with his experience,

530
00:28:26,463 --> 00:28:28,534
believed in my vision,

531
00:28:28,568 --> 00:28:30,363
said, "Okay, kid,
you can do this.

532
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:32,227
You got a future."

533
00:28:32,262 --> 00:28:35,127
That made one very confident.

534
00:28:35,161 --> 00:28:38,924
If Bob Joffrey says
you can do it, go for it.

535
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:50,452
The Zoom has been a window
into dancers

536
00:28:50,487 --> 00:28:53,283
that's very interesting
and very different

537
00:28:53,317 --> 00:28:54,456
because they're at home.

538
00:28:54,491 --> 00:28:56,355
-Hello, little petit.

539
00:28:56,389 --> 00:28:59,461
Oh, he's fast asleep,
and he's getting very large.

540
00:28:59,496 --> 00:29:02,326
Hi, Dad.
This is my son, Jesse.

541
00:29:02,361 --> 00:29:03,569
-Hello. Good morning.

542
00:29:03,603 --> 00:29:05,122
-You're coming into their home.

543
00:29:05,157 --> 00:29:09,126
You're coming into time
shared with them

544
00:29:09,161 --> 00:29:11,128
in a very different way.

545
00:29:11,163 --> 00:29:13,372
And you're working on --
I really appreciate it --

546
00:29:13,406 --> 00:29:15,098
through your dinner hour, right?

547
00:29:15,132 --> 00:29:19,102
Now, you begin
with one little step,

548
00:29:19,136 --> 00:29:24,141
one little beat to the front,
one little step sautÃ©

549
00:29:24,176 --> 00:29:26,799
and a piquÃ© arabesque.

550
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:31,183
That's it.

551
00:29:38,155 --> 00:29:39,881
Good. Okay, good.

552
00:29:39,916 --> 00:29:42,090
Very nice, Maria.
Very, very nice.

553
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:45,611
After you've done the mazurka
and the little bourrÃ©e,

554
00:29:45,645 --> 00:29:50,858
Curdie is going to be coming
in upstage left.

555
00:30:00,177 --> 00:30:01,869
Okay. Good.

556
00:30:01,903 --> 00:30:04,285
Alright. Good, Benjamin.
Very good.

557
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:05,976
You need to be just a little bit

558
00:30:06,011 --> 00:30:08,185
more exaggerated
with your action.

559
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:11,326
When the earth shakes, it needs
to be a little bit bigger.

560
00:30:11,361 --> 00:30:13,466
When she hits the ground,
it's gotta be,

561
00:30:13,501 --> 00:30:15,399
"Oh, what's happening here?"

562
00:30:15,434 --> 00:30:16,504
Do you know about me?

563
00:30:16,538 --> 00:30:18,230
I'll tell you all
about my history.

564
00:30:18,264 --> 00:30:20,646
I grew up working
in a drive-in theater

565
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:24,615
from the time I was 8 years old
until I went to college.

566
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:30,621
I saw probably 1,000 cartoons
as a young person.

567
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:35,247
My entire world view is formed
on that kind of time

568
00:30:35,281 --> 00:30:37,145
and that kind of exaggeration.

569
00:30:40,424 --> 00:30:42,254
The family's Quaker.

570
00:30:42,288 --> 00:30:47,397
And they had stringent thoughts
about morality

571
00:30:47,431 --> 00:30:52,574
and about discipline
and responsibility.

572
00:30:52,609 --> 00:30:54,991
My mother was a concert pianist.

573
00:30:55,025 --> 00:30:57,165
She started teaching piano
when the war came

574
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,926
in order to help support
the family.

575
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,413
So she herself had never
accomplished as an artist

576
00:31:03,447 --> 00:31:04,552
what she wanted to.

577
00:31:04,586 --> 00:31:08,176
And she was never known
as an artist.

578
00:31:08,211 --> 00:31:12,180
She, from the get-go, planned
that this child of hers

579
00:31:12,215 --> 00:31:16,081
was going to accomplish that.

580
00:31:16,115 --> 00:31:19,670
Southern Indiana,
the community was very poor.

581
00:31:19,705 --> 00:31:23,571
And my mother determined
that her children

582
00:31:23,605 --> 00:31:27,609
were not going to get
the future she wanted for them.

583
00:31:27,644 --> 00:31:33,408
And she moved the family
to Southern California.

584
00:31:33,443 --> 00:31:38,689
She started all of her kids
on ear training

585
00:31:38,724 --> 00:31:40,519
when we were not
even a year old.

586
00:31:40,553 --> 00:31:43,004
By the time I was 2
I was already being taken

587
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,420
to a professional
children's teacher.

588
00:31:45,455 --> 00:31:48,665
I was playing a children's
violin, small violin

589
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:50,287
by the time I was 4.

590
00:31:50,322 --> 00:31:52,082
Whether it was dance or music

591
00:31:52,117 --> 00:31:57,225
or percussion or painting
or elocution or German,

592
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,400
in case we had another war
with the Germans

593
00:31:59,434 --> 00:32:01,091
I should speak German,

594
00:32:01,126 --> 00:32:04,232
French because the ballet is
in French.

595
00:32:04,267 --> 00:32:05,509
We needed to speak French.

596
00:32:05,544 --> 00:32:07,684
Typing I can do very well.

597
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:12,102
Shorthand I had
in case all else failed.

598
00:32:12,137 --> 00:32:14,311
My mother always went out
of her way

599
00:32:14,346 --> 00:32:17,245
to find the very best teachers
that she can find.

600
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,972
She ended up driving
hundreds of miles every week

601
00:32:20,007 --> 00:32:22,216
to have ballet lessons.

602
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:26,116
And I'm doing my homework
by the glove compartment light

603
00:32:26,151 --> 00:32:28,084
while we're driving
to San Marino,

604
00:32:28,118 --> 00:32:31,604
which is 120 miles round trip.

605
00:32:31,639 --> 00:32:35,229
She'd drive it twice
or three times a week.

606
00:32:35,263 --> 00:32:38,370
My brothers and sister
did have teenage years.

607
00:32:38,404 --> 00:32:40,096
They did go to dances.

608
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:42,477
They were part of
the school activities.

609
00:32:42,512 --> 00:32:43,616
They did have cars.

610
00:32:43,651 --> 00:32:45,101
They learned to drive --

611
00:32:45,135 --> 00:32:46,999
none of these things that I do

612
00:32:47,034 --> 00:32:49,346
because I was much too busy

613
00:32:49,381 --> 00:32:53,143
being groomed
to become something.

614
00:32:53,178 --> 00:32:56,526
I do regret not having had
more interaction

615
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,184
with young people my age.

616
00:32:59,218 --> 00:33:02,359
Feeling so isolated,
pulled away from everybody.

617
00:33:02,394 --> 00:33:04,706
How to relate to other people --

618
00:33:04,741 --> 00:33:06,501
I didn't have lessons in that.

619
00:33:06,536 --> 00:33:10,402
Sometimes I think my mom
gave me lessons

620
00:33:10,436 --> 00:33:14,268
in everything
that's possible in life

621
00:33:14,302 --> 00:33:16,304
except how to live life.

622
00:33:19,549 --> 00:33:22,103
Good morning, Maria.

623
00:33:22,138 --> 00:33:25,762
Maria, please meet Benjamin.
Benjamin, meet Maria.

624
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:28,765
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello. Very nice to meet you.

625
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:33,494
-One of the big challenges
of this whole project

626
00:33:33,528 --> 00:33:36,600
and what we're working
to do here

627
00:33:36,635 --> 00:33:41,743
is establish that people
who are as separate as we are

628
00:33:41,778 --> 00:33:43,814
can be connected.

629
00:33:43,849 --> 00:33:50,856
And so you have to make the
impossible theatrically real.

630
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:53,376
Now, one thing
that's going to help us there

631
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:55,619
is spatial accuracy.

632
00:34:00,417 --> 00:34:03,558
And go, Benjamin!

633
00:34:11,877 --> 00:34:14,707
Okay. Hold on. Thank you.
Yeah. Thatagirl.

634
00:34:14,742 --> 00:34:16,675
Back it off
to the edge of your hawk.

635
00:34:16,709 --> 00:34:19,298
Is she going to bow first,
or are you, Benjamin?

636
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:21,680
Which would you say in this
kind of character role?

637
00:34:21,714 --> 00:34:23,095
-I should, I think.

638
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:25,270
-Well, who do you think, Maria?

639
00:34:25,304 --> 00:34:27,134
-I think me.

640
00:34:27,168 --> 00:34:31,276
-She thinks her.
Why does Irene bow first?

641
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:34,727
-Because she was taught
all of these manners

642
00:34:34,762 --> 00:34:37,868
and she's
a very well-behaved girl.

643
00:34:37,903 --> 00:34:39,663
I don't know.

644
00:34:39,698 --> 00:34:43,219
-And why did you think
he bowed first, Benjamin?

645
00:34:43,253 --> 00:34:46,291
-Well, because I'm the man.
He needs to show her...

646
00:34:46,325 --> 00:34:49,432
-There you are.
This is our culture.

647
00:34:49,466 --> 00:34:50,916
We live in it.

648
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:56,404
MacDonald, the author, would say
that Curdie bows first

649
00:34:56,439 --> 00:35:00,753
because Curdie is lower class.

650
00:35:00,788 --> 00:35:02,307
She's upper-class.

651
00:35:02,341 --> 00:35:05,586
But I like Maria's instinct.

652
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:09,935
She bows first because
she's an independent girl!

653
00:35:09,969 --> 00:35:12,213
See what I'm saying, right?

654
00:35:18,564 --> 00:35:20,256
Right on the heels
of "Deuce Coupe,"

655
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:22,637
the Ballet Theater called
and said, you know,

656
00:35:22,672 --> 00:35:25,778
would I make a piece
for Baryshnikov?

657
00:35:28,816 --> 00:35:32,613
Baryshnikov was one of the
leading male classical dancers

658
00:35:32,647 --> 00:35:34,511
of the 20th century.

659
00:35:39,723 --> 00:35:41,415
The guy was phenomenal.

660
00:35:41,449 --> 00:35:45,936
His technique was like, "Wow!"

661
00:35:45,971 --> 00:35:49,975
He was a huge star in Russia,
and he'd just defected.

662
00:35:50,009 --> 00:35:52,840
And he hadn't performed
in this country yet.

663
00:35:52,874 --> 00:35:55,705
I remember running into
Alvin Ailey

664
00:35:55,739 --> 00:35:59,260
in one of the elevators
somewhere, some dance building,

665
00:35:59,295 --> 00:36:00,917
and Alvin just looked at me
and he said,

666
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:03,402
"You're going to write
a piece for Baryshnikov.

667
00:36:03,437 --> 00:36:07,475
You're crazy.
You're going to be eaten alive."

668
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:09,512
There was pressure.

669
00:36:09,546 --> 00:36:11,238
It was big deal
in the dance world.

670
00:36:11,272 --> 00:36:13,861
Here's arguably the greatest
dancer in the world.

671
00:36:13,895 --> 00:36:15,759
What are you going to do
with this guy?

672
00:36:18,452 --> 00:36:21,662
There are huge expectations
on the part of the audience

673
00:36:21,696 --> 00:36:25,010
as to what he should be
doing for them.

674
00:36:30,878 --> 00:36:33,639
He'd seen me dance before
we started to work,

675
00:36:33,674 --> 00:36:35,365
which I thought was important

676
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,299
because that's what I was
going to push him towards.

677
00:36:38,334 --> 00:36:41,854
...a costume for "Swan Lake,"
so that would be good, too.

678
00:36:44,754 --> 00:36:49,655
I had to be able to evolve
for him a vocabulary

679
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:51,485
that enfolded some of
this kind of --

680
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:53,728
let's just, for lack of
a better word, call it slouch.

681
00:36:53,763 --> 00:36:55,523
It's a totally different
kind of placement

682
00:36:55,558 --> 00:36:57,387
from the classical ballet.

683
00:36:57,422 --> 00:37:00,632
And he was all-in
to try to do that.

684
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:10,780
-Exactly.
-Okay. Exactly. Okay.

685
00:37:10,814 --> 00:37:12,506
-Was there any difficulty
that you had

686
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:16,061
from adjusting from a classical
style to Twyla's style?

687
00:37:16,095 --> 00:37:19,478
-Sure, it was difficult,
very difficult, I think.

688
00:37:19,513 --> 00:37:22,378
-In what way?

689
00:37:22,412 --> 00:37:24,552
-Well, it's her style,
her ballet.

690
00:37:24,587 --> 00:37:26,727
It's really hard.

691
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,770
-It's not easy, I think,

692
00:37:35,805 --> 00:37:40,913
for dancers who know
perfectly modern dance.

693
00:37:40,948 --> 00:37:42,881
Yeah?

694
00:37:42,915 --> 00:37:44,365
-Sometimes. No, that's right.

695
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,368
-It's not, but it's --
Um, um...

696
00:37:47,403 --> 00:37:49,301
-What?
-I don't think that

697
00:37:49,336 --> 00:37:50,578
it's any easier or any harder

698
00:37:50,613 --> 00:37:51,821
for, you know,
a well-trained dancer

699
00:37:51,855 --> 00:37:53,926
who's either classical
or modern.

700
00:38:07,733 --> 00:38:09,356
Okay, let's do it this way.

701
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:11,806
-This movement --
it's not natural for me

702
00:38:11,841 --> 00:38:14,499
because I'm born in Russia,
you know?

703
00:38:16,052 --> 00:38:18,434
-He actually
had just come to this country

704
00:38:18,468 --> 00:38:19,883
and he was displaced.

705
00:38:19,918 --> 00:38:22,921
He's Russian,
classically trained.

706
00:38:22,955 --> 00:38:25,579
I'm from the Midwest,
modern dancer.

707
00:38:25,613 --> 00:38:28,823
You could not have found
more disparate elements

708
00:38:28,858 --> 00:38:31,481
to try to gather together.

709
00:38:33,725 --> 00:38:35,589
I took a gamble,

710
00:38:35,623 --> 00:38:39,662
and I opened him
in a totally unexpected way,

711
00:38:39,696 --> 00:38:41,974
with him doing a kind of --

712
00:38:45,461 --> 00:38:47,083
And the audience is going,
"Huh?"

713
00:38:57,127 --> 00:39:00,096
And then when
the curtain goes up, whack!

714
00:39:01,718 --> 00:39:03,962
All he's got!

715
00:39:32,853 --> 00:39:34,820
"Push" was lightning
in a bottle.

716
00:39:34,855 --> 00:39:36,408
It was a moment in time.

717
00:39:36,443 --> 00:39:39,653
It could only have happened
between the two of us

718
00:39:39,687 --> 00:39:44,002
at that point in time, singular.

719
00:39:44,036 --> 00:39:47,730
I was asked to make a duet
for a gala with Misha.

720
00:39:47,764 --> 00:39:51,596
I had no experience partnering.

721
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,494
-What are we doing?!

722
00:39:53,529 --> 00:39:55,151
-The same thing that we did
yesterday.

723
00:39:55,185 --> 00:39:57,705
-No.

724
00:40:00,018 --> 00:40:02,710
-Maybe it's possible
to just lay there,

725
00:40:02,745 --> 00:40:04,712
and you will be in position.

726
00:40:04,747 --> 00:40:06,196
-You're gonna do there?
-Yes.

727
00:40:06,231 --> 00:40:08,026
-You're gonna do nothing?
-Nothing.

728
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:15,896
-Yeah, yeah, that's good.
I like that.

729
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:18,070
-Oh, yeah. Oh, I like it.

730
00:40:18,105 --> 00:40:21,798
I love it. It's a good --

731
00:40:21,833 --> 00:40:23,524
-It's good, but it's...

732
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:26,596
-Wonderful!

733
00:40:26,631 --> 00:40:29,634
The dynamic that I started
doing with partnering

734
00:40:29,668 --> 00:40:31,601
was I would partner
as much as he partnered.

735
00:40:31,636 --> 00:40:33,879
I would push, he would pull,
and so on.

736
00:40:33,914 --> 00:40:35,605
In the classical ballet,
traditionally,

737
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,918
the woman is more passive,

738
00:40:37,952 --> 00:40:40,058
and I started doing
equal pressure.

739
00:40:40,092 --> 00:40:43,026
And that's what we actually
started working on.

740
00:40:43,061 --> 00:40:44,959
Ah!
-Sorry.

741
00:40:44,994 --> 00:40:47,617
-Oh, my God.
-Sorry.

742
00:40:47,652 --> 00:40:52,726
-I'm very grateful to Misha
that he made the moves

743
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,762
to alter his life completely

744
00:40:54,797 --> 00:40:58,145
so that I could have the
opportunity to work with him.

745
00:42:45,217 --> 00:42:47,185
-During the course of my career,

746
00:42:47,219 --> 00:42:50,119
I've used many different
kinds of music.

747
00:42:50,153 --> 00:42:52,742
Every kind of music
that moves me, I use it,

748
00:42:52,777 --> 00:42:54,951
whether it's pop,
whether it's classical,

749
00:42:54,986 --> 00:42:58,230
whether it's jazz,
whether it's historic.

750
00:43:07,757 --> 00:43:11,036
I grew up totally exposed
to music,

751
00:43:11,071 --> 00:43:16,732
practicing it, hearing it,
loving it, living in it.

752
00:43:16,766 --> 00:43:21,391
So, having spent five years
dancing with no music,

753
00:43:21,426 --> 00:43:24,740
I felt that I understood that,

754
00:43:24,774 --> 00:43:27,225
and then I could use anything.

755
00:43:38,857 --> 00:43:41,135
-Milos Forman saw "Push"

756
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:43,137
and asked if I would like
to work on "Hair."

757
00:43:56,944 --> 00:43:59,119
-I was massively over-prepared.

758
00:43:59,153 --> 00:44:01,708
I had done, like,
enough choreography

759
00:44:01,742 --> 00:44:03,848
for like eight pictures.

760
00:44:03,882 --> 00:44:06,333
I had so many arguments
with Milos

761
00:44:06,367 --> 00:44:08,887
about every single scene.

762
00:44:08,922 --> 00:44:11,303
I mean, there was the one
with the dust storm,

763
00:44:11,338 --> 00:44:15,273
which was like 2 degrees
outside in December.

764
00:44:15,307 --> 00:44:18,966
I said, "Milos, you can't
shoot in December outside."

765
00:44:19,001 --> 00:44:20,968
He said,
"It gets warm sometimes."

766
00:44:21,003 --> 00:44:22,901
So, everybody is out
there freezing to death.

767
00:44:22,936 --> 00:44:26,387
It was an agony.
It's probably my favorite scene.

768
00:44:34,326 --> 00:44:36,363
-We fly through water and fire,

769
00:44:36,397 --> 00:44:40,470
which we actually did because
we didn't know any better.

770
00:44:40,505 --> 00:44:42,024
We did all the stunts.

771
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:50,204
-Worked on the script
for one year.

772
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:52,517
We shot for a year.
We edited for a year.

773
00:44:52,551 --> 00:44:54,726
It was a long haul.

774
00:45:40,013 --> 00:45:42,325
-I just want to do the crane
just one more time.

775
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:45,501
And it'll just be the --

776
00:45:45,535 --> 00:45:49,574
-The whole thing done again
on a different...

777
00:45:49,608 --> 00:45:51,852
-I got to have three minutes.

778
00:45:51,887 --> 00:45:54,372
-Got to give Twyla a three.

779
00:45:54,406 --> 00:45:56,546
-Three minutes.

780
00:45:59,032 --> 00:46:01,931
-Okay, it'll take time
to move the cameras anyway.

781
00:46:01,966 --> 00:46:03,346
Would you like
to get out of the lights?

782
00:46:03,381 --> 00:46:05,003
You think that will be better?
-You want to sit down?

783
00:46:05,038 --> 00:46:07,419
-You have enough time.
-No, it's okay.

784
00:46:07,454 --> 00:46:09,180
-What do you do
to recharge yourself

785
00:46:09,214 --> 00:46:11,976
when you work long periods hard?

786
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:15,151
-Work more.
-More work. A work junkie.

787
00:46:15,186 --> 00:46:16,808
When was your last --
-No, that's not fair.

788
00:46:16,843 --> 00:46:18,120
That's not fair.

789
00:46:18,154 --> 00:46:20,605
-Your life is nothing but dance,
one is told.

790
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:23,090
You have no recreations,
no side interests.

791
00:46:23,125 --> 00:46:24,574
-Right.
-I really have heard this.

792
00:46:24,609 --> 00:46:26,162
Can you throw it all away,

793
00:46:26,197 --> 00:46:28,371
take two weeks in the Caribbean
or whatever

794
00:46:28,406 --> 00:46:29,510
and never think of dance?

795
00:46:29,545 --> 00:46:31,340
-Well, I wouldn't want to.
-Yeah.

796
00:46:31,374 --> 00:46:34,205
-I mean, working is a
recreation, is what I'm saying.

797
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:37,864
-You have become kind of
a superstar in the dance world.

798
00:46:37,898 --> 00:46:40,383
It's an embarrassing thing
to call anybody.

799
00:46:40,418 --> 00:46:43,386
But is there any sense in what
you feel the pinch of celebrity

800
00:46:43,421 --> 00:46:46,527
or being crowded by it
-I try not to pay any attention.

801
00:46:46,562 --> 00:46:48,840
I don't know anything about
this.

802
00:46:48,875 --> 00:46:50,428
-But you don't feel the
pressures of --

803
00:46:50,462 --> 00:46:51,601
-I just go to the studio
in the morning

804
00:46:51,636 --> 00:46:52,913
and come out at night.

805
00:46:52,948 --> 00:46:54,466
Tell me about "Baker's Dozen."

806
00:46:54,501 --> 00:46:57,055
-In "Baker's Dozen," the music
is all Willie "The Lion" Smith.

807
00:46:59,368 --> 00:47:02,233
"Hair" was a very long project.

808
00:47:02,267 --> 00:47:04,235
When that picture was over,

809
00:47:04,269 --> 00:47:10,172
I had to reestablish who I was
and what the company was.

810
00:47:10,206 --> 00:47:13,416
The company had spent
a lot of time rehearsing

811
00:47:13,451 --> 00:47:18,007
a lot of material that ended up
on the cutting-room floor.

812
00:47:18,042 --> 00:47:19,906
So I took outtakes

813
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,908
and combined them with material

814
00:47:21,942 --> 00:47:25,083
that I took from improvs
that I had done

815
00:47:25,118 --> 00:47:29,363
when I was pregnant with Jess.

816
00:47:29,398 --> 00:47:31,607
"Baker's Dozen,"
12 dancers onstage

817
00:47:31,641 --> 00:47:33,505
and one in the oven.

818
00:47:39,132 --> 00:47:41,410
-Say, there's someone
next to you posing as a child.

819
00:47:43,308 --> 00:47:45,207
Stand up, young man.

820
00:47:45,241 --> 00:47:46,518
Come to Uncle Dick.

821
00:47:49,659 --> 00:47:51,454
Now just sit right up here.

822
00:47:51,489 --> 00:47:54,216
Ohh!

823
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:57,150
Chunky little nipper, isn't he?

824
00:47:57,184 --> 00:47:59,428
What's your name?
-You know what my name is.

825
00:48:01,223 --> 00:48:03,328
-Are you the kid
I was talking to over there?

826
00:48:03,363 --> 00:48:04,364
-Yes.

827
00:48:04,398 --> 00:48:06,711
-It slipped my mind.
What is it?

828
00:48:06,745 --> 00:48:08,368
-Jesse.
-Is it Jesse?

829
00:48:08,402 --> 00:48:11,198
-Yes.
-Jesse, are you a dancer?

830
00:48:11,233 --> 00:48:13,960
I can tell by your
highly developed calves

831
00:48:13,994 --> 00:48:16,169
and your lovely dance slippers

832
00:48:16,203 --> 00:48:19,517
that you're probably not
following in Mom's footsteps,

833
00:48:19,551 --> 00:48:21,243
at least in those shoes.

834
00:48:21,277 --> 00:48:25,247
-No.

835
00:48:25,281 --> 00:48:26,455
-Being a dancer,

836
00:48:26,489 --> 00:48:29,976
which at the level I've danced
at, is a full-time job.

837
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:34,014
Making dances is another
full-time job.

838
00:48:34,049 --> 00:48:36,637
Running businesses
is a full-time job.

839
00:48:36,672 --> 00:48:41,539
And could I have cut out
from those three full-time jobs

840
00:48:41,573 --> 00:48:46,337
10% to be spending
directly with Jess?

841
00:48:46,371 --> 00:48:48,995
I'm not sure that 10% would
really have helped Jess.

842
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:53,723
-I don't want to say
my childhood was negative.

843
00:48:53,758 --> 00:48:56,726
-Oh?
-You know, it was hard, yeah.

844
00:48:56,761 --> 00:48:58,487
It was hard.
There was hard stuff.

845
00:48:58,521 --> 00:49:00,661
But there's no guilt.

846
00:49:00,696 --> 00:49:02,042
I don't think you have guilt.

847
00:49:02,077 --> 00:49:04,079
-Oh, I have tons of guilt,
honey.

848
00:49:04,113 --> 00:49:06,150
I do.

849
00:49:06,184 --> 00:49:09,049
-You were an executive
running a company,

850
00:49:09,084 --> 00:49:10,464
and I was cool with that.

851
00:49:10,499 --> 00:49:14,675
But at the same time, I wanted
to know who my mom was.

852
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:18,196
I was definitely on my own.

853
00:49:18,231 --> 00:49:20,026
-You saw me occasionally.

854
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:22,442
-I saw you.

855
00:49:22,476 --> 00:49:26,342
I saw you light a lot of things
on fire in the kitchen.

856
00:49:26,377 --> 00:49:29,552
-Well, I was trying to cook.

857
00:49:29,587 --> 00:49:33,556
-Art kind of was
the top of the podium,

858
00:49:33,591 --> 00:49:35,765
and then there were people.

859
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:40,322
Art was what was first.

860
00:49:40,356 --> 00:49:44,291
It was challenging and lonely.

861
00:49:44,326 --> 00:49:46,397
And there were scary things.

862
00:49:46,431 --> 00:49:50,608
But even though you were
doing your thing,

863
00:49:50,642 --> 00:49:55,544
I was exposed to so much.

864
00:49:55,578 --> 00:50:00,307
And I grew up
in this weird world.

865
00:50:02,723 --> 00:50:06,106
I grew up around people
who were so committed

866
00:50:06,141 --> 00:50:09,178
to what they were doing.

867
00:50:09,213 --> 00:50:10,559
I wouldn't go to the theater

868
00:50:10,593 --> 00:50:15,253
because I didn't want to be
your kid in that world.

869
00:50:15,288 --> 00:50:18,705
Like, I wanted to be your kid,
like your kid,

870
00:50:18,739 --> 00:50:20,810
like your -- your kid.

871
00:50:29,785 --> 00:50:31,718
-When "The Catherine Wheel"
began,

872
00:50:31,752 --> 00:50:36,481
it started with the idea
that technology could offer

873
00:50:36,516 --> 00:50:41,072
a new look at a dancer.

874
00:50:41,107 --> 00:50:42,694
"The Catherine Wheel"

875
00:50:42,729 --> 00:50:47,837
has one of the first
motion-capture figures.

876
00:50:47,872 --> 00:50:51,703
And it has some sort of
video experiments

877
00:50:51,738 --> 00:50:54,189
that certainly helped me
with the foundation

878
00:50:54,223 --> 00:50:57,330
for what we're trying to do
in the Zoom stuff.

879
00:50:57,364 --> 00:51:00,712
-"The Catherine Wheel" is the
most ambitious work to date

880
00:51:00,747 --> 00:51:03,508
by one of the pioneers
of contemporary American dance,

881
00:51:03,543 --> 00:51:05,372
Twyla Tharp.

882
00:51:05,407 --> 00:51:07,512
-Okay, yeah, now, how are you
getting that arm under?

883
00:51:07,547 --> 00:51:08,617
Like, he's actually
lifting her leg.

884
00:51:08,651 --> 00:51:10,481
Do it again.

885
00:51:10,515 --> 00:51:12,655
-Her starting point was
the legend of St. Catherine,

886
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:14,347
the 4th century martyr

887
00:51:14,381 --> 00:51:16,383
who strove to overcome
her human failings

888
00:51:16,418 --> 00:51:20,146
in pursuit of an almost
abstract spiritual perfection.

889
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:23,356
She's depicted in
a non-human electronic form.

890
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:25,496
Sara is driven
by a hopeless ambition

891
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:28,395
to achieve the unattainable
discipline and control

892
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:30,328
of this computerized
Catherine.

893
00:51:30,363 --> 00:51:32,434
-This seems desirable,
that for some reason

894
00:51:32,468 --> 00:51:35,126
we should all strive to attain.

895
00:51:35,161 --> 00:51:39,924
So she sets out striving to
become a perfect human being,

896
00:51:39,958 --> 00:51:42,237
which is the case with many
dancers much of the time.

897
00:51:42,271 --> 00:51:43,583
You are never good enough.

898
00:51:43,617 --> 00:51:46,310
You should always be able
to do one more pirouette,

899
00:51:46,344 --> 00:51:48,312
your elevation
always be a little stronger.

900
00:51:48,346 --> 00:51:50,866
Your elevation should always
be a little more.

901
00:51:59,288 --> 00:52:01,911
-I commissioned David Byrne
to write the score.

902
00:52:01,946 --> 00:52:04,707
It was his first
independent work

903
00:52:04,742 --> 00:52:07,262
apart from The Talking Heads.

904
00:52:07,296 --> 00:52:10,713
-She wanted do a full-length,
you know, evening-length piece.

905
00:52:10,748 --> 00:52:14,338
That was a big gulp for me.
I mean, that's a lot of music.

906
00:52:16,374 --> 00:52:18,480
But it was also
very exciting for me

907
00:52:18,514 --> 00:52:20,171
because she wanted it to be

908
00:52:20,206 --> 00:52:23,174
unlike anything people
had seen before.

909
00:52:23,209 --> 00:52:24,727
And she wanted it to be
on Broadway.

910
00:52:24,762 --> 00:52:26,660
This was kind of putting a stake
in the ground

911
00:52:26,695 --> 00:52:30,354
and saying, "Contemporary dance
can be on Broadway."

912
00:52:30,388 --> 00:52:31,527
That's a big deal.

913
00:52:32,908 --> 00:52:35,669
-I was in the studio
all the time,

914
00:52:35,704 --> 00:52:38,396
which meant I was rehearsing
during the day

915
00:52:38,431 --> 00:52:41,813
and then in recording studios
with him working at night.

916
00:52:53,239 --> 00:52:54,999
I could tell
that she would drive the dancers

917
00:52:55,033 --> 00:52:56,828
pretty hard physically.

918
00:52:56,863 --> 00:52:59,969
These are top-notch,
trained dancers,

919
00:53:00,004 --> 00:53:01,730
and she would push them
to the limits

920
00:53:01,764 --> 00:53:03,559
of what they could do
physically.

921
00:53:03,594 --> 00:53:07,770
And they'd get there,
and she'd push them further

922
00:53:07,805 --> 00:53:09,427
and see if they could go
further.

923
00:53:09,462 --> 00:53:12,016
-To get through whole evening,
it was --

924
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:13,983
You had to get yourself
much more mentally prepared

925
00:53:14,018 --> 00:53:15,468
than I've ever had to before.

926
00:53:15,502 --> 00:53:18,436
-Well, it's the longest piece
I've ever done

927
00:53:18,471 --> 00:53:20,507
and the hardest.

928
00:53:20,542 --> 00:53:24,235
-There was worries of whether
we'd get through the evening.

929
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:25,961
-In the same way that
she was driving the dancers,

930
00:53:25,995 --> 00:53:27,756
she was driving me,
kind of pushing me

931
00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:31,242
to raise the level
of what I had done.

932
00:53:31,277 --> 00:53:35,384
We got to about a little over
an hour's worth of material,

933
00:53:35,419 --> 00:53:37,766
and she was asking for more

934
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,768
and then more and then more.

935
00:53:39,802 --> 00:53:41,977
-And he just goes, "Is this it?
Am I done yet?"

936
00:53:42,011 --> 00:53:43,289
And I said, "No.

937
00:53:43,323 --> 00:53:45,325
"Just you go listen
to more Bach.

938
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:48,397
It's going to keep climbing.
We're not done yet."

939
00:53:48,432 --> 00:53:50,917
-I'd never had anyone push me
like that before.

940
00:53:50,951 --> 00:53:52,436
Turned out to be really good
for me.

941
00:54:05,794 --> 00:54:09,522
I got a taste of how a show
like this got put together,

942
00:54:09,556 --> 00:54:11,489
and watching Twyla
manage all that

943
00:54:11,524 --> 00:54:13,457
was incredibly influential to me

944
00:54:13,491 --> 00:54:15,390
because not too long after that

945
00:54:15,424 --> 00:54:18,358
I started working with
Talking Heads on staging a show.

946
00:54:18,393 --> 00:54:21,913
And so this was maybe
the beginning of me

947
00:54:21,948 --> 00:54:24,709
starting to exercise
those muscles creatively.

948
00:54:44,522 --> 00:54:46,697
With "The Catherine Wheel,"

949
00:54:46,731 --> 00:54:49,493
we had become
a very large institution.

950
00:54:49,527 --> 00:54:52,737
We were over 20 dancers.

951
00:54:52,772 --> 00:54:55,878
We had a staff of 10 people.

952
00:54:55,913 --> 00:54:58,881
I was doing too many jobs.

953
00:54:58,916 --> 00:55:00,642
I mean, I was doing
commercial work

954
00:55:00,676 --> 00:55:02,471
on top of touring the company,

955
00:55:02,506 --> 00:55:04,611
and at the same time,
as I'm doing, you know,

956
00:55:04,646 --> 00:55:06,993
this thing for John Curry.

957
00:55:17,037 --> 00:55:20,420
-Peter Martins and Twyla Tharp
and Lynn Swann.

958
00:55:20,455 --> 00:55:23,354
They're combining, really
combining, battle and football.

959
00:55:25,908 --> 00:55:27,841
-We had toured Mexico,

960
00:55:27,876 --> 00:55:29,567
and there I'd learned

961
00:55:29,602 --> 00:55:33,088
about the Aztec
ritual sacrifice of humans.

962
00:55:33,122 --> 00:55:37,610
This had a very big impact
on the next work.

963
00:55:41,476 --> 00:55:44,617
"Bad Smells" we premiered
back to back with...

964
00:55:44,651 --> 00:55:49,000
-...Frank Sinatra songs.

965
00:55:53,419 --> 00:55:56,629
-In order to support
this mechanism,

966
00:55:56,663 --> 00:56:00,805
we were doing a very large
number of fundraising events,

967
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,566
galas, photo shoots,

968
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:06,501
federal subsidies,
state subsidy, patronage.

969
00:56:06,535 --> 00:56:13,508
We were touring 150 shows a year
over the world.

970
00:56:13,542 --> 00:56:14,819
And I was very fragmented.

971
00:56:14,854 --> 00:56:17,995
A piece of me
was doing over here

972
00:56:18,029 --> 00:56:19,859
and then these guys
are on the road

973
00:56:19,893 --> 00:56:21,826
and then these guys
are coming back.

974
00:56:21,861 --> 00:56:26,072
Jesse was becoming
further distance

975
00:56:26,106 --> 00:56:28,902
as I'm bouncing around here.

976
00:56:28,937 --> 00:56:31,664
I was being very,
very destructive for myself.

977
00:56:31,698 --> 00:56:35,909
I was going to have to stop
working the way I was

978
00:56:35,944 --> 00:56:38,947
because this could not
be sustained.

979
00:56:38,981 --> 00:56:41,777
It is the irony of success.

980
00:56:41,812 --> 00:56:42,951
They want you to look like

981
00:56:42,985 --> 00:56:44,987
what they think
you ought to look like.

982
00:56:45,022 --> 00:56:50,061
And it becomes about repetition
rather than trying new things.

983
00:56:50,096 --> 00:56:52,719
When I began to make dances,
that's what I was doing.

984
00:56:52,754 --> 00:56:54,031
I was making dances.

985
00:56:54,065 --> 00:56:58,000
And now there was no time left
to make dances

986
00:56:58,035 --> 00:57:02,211
or to work in the studio
with dancers, to evolve.

987
00:57:02,246 --> 00:57:05,214
The result of that period --

988
00:57:05,249 --> 00:57:08,045
it should be fine to say
that I broke down.

989
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:09,598
It should be all right
to say that.

990
00:57:09,633 --> 00:57:14,154
Anybody would, having that kind
of responsibility.

991
00:57:14,189 --> 00:57:16,985
But it's not.
It's not okay to say that.

992
00:57:17,019 --> 00:57:19,850
So, how do I say
that I kind of failed here?

993
00:57:19,884 --> 00:57:23,509
Because, you know, you want
to be everything for everyone.

994
00:57:23,543 --> 00:57:25,234
You can't.

995
00:57:33,311 --> 00:57:38,903
So, now, Herman, let's talk
about life for a moment here.

996
00:57:38,938 --> 00:57:42,562
Misty, I think, came back
too soon from her procedure.

997
00:57:42,597 --> 00:57:44,530
She's out for two weeks.

998
00:57:44,564 --> 00:57:46,739
She has to have an MRI.

999
00:57:46,773 --> 00:57:49,258
-My back does not feel ready.

1000
00:57:49,293 --> 00:57:51,778
I'm feeling a lot of pain

1001
00:57:51,813 --> 00:57:56,162
and decided I needed to take,
like, another month off.

1002
00:57:56,196 --> 00:57:58,164
She ended up
bringing in Charlie.

1003
00:57:58,198 --> 00:58:01,857
-Charlie, I'm going to ask you
to do me a huge favor.

1004
00:58:01,892 --> 00:58:04,273
-I met Twyla
through her company.

1005
00:58:04,308 --> 00:58:06,828
I was 22 at the time,
and this was on the tail end

1006
00:58:06,862 --> 00:58:08,657
of maybe 60 different auditions.

1007
00:58:08,692 --> 00:58:10,210
And they all said
that I was way too short

1008
00:58:10,245 --> 00:58:12,696
and way too fat
to be taken seriously.

1009
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:14,145
Twyla said,
"I would love to hire you

1010
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:16,251
to be in the touring company."

1011
00:58:16,285 --> 00:58:18,529
A testament to Twyla's
open-mindedness

1012
00:58:18,564 --> 00:58:20,186
is that if someone
like Misty Copeland

1013
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:22,982
is unavailable
to finish choreography,

1014
00:58:23,016 --> 00:58:24,846
she's not going to say,
"We need to typecast

1015
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,331
"and find the exact same type of
person to fulfill this.

1016
00:58:27,365 --> 00:58:28,953
"Does it provide new interest

1017
00:58:28,988 --> 00:58:32,750
because that person looks
different or is different?"

1018
00:58:32,785 --> 00:58:36,340
-I got replaced
by a short, white, bald man.

1019
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:40,068
-I mean, this is
the queen of the underworld,

1020
00:58:40,102 --> 00:58:43,140
but if queens can be kings,
then kings can be queens.

1021
00:58:43,174 --> 00:58:46,281
This is Charlie Hodges.

1022
00:58:46,315 --> 00:58:47,938
He's in L.A.

1023
00:58:47,972 --> 00:58:50,872
There it is not quite
00 in the morning,

1024
00:58:50,906 --> 00:58:53,253
so he is working
through breakfast.

1025
00:58:53,288 --> 00:58:54,323
-Hello?

1026
00:58:54,358 --> 00:58:56,567
-Hello, Maria.

1027
00:58:56,602 --> 00:58:59,052
Maria is working
through dinner hours.

1028
00:58:59,087 --> 00:59:01,607
Oh, it's great.
We can work around the clock.

1029
00:59:01,641 --> 00:59:03,298
Yes.

1030
00:59:05,127 --> 00:59:06,853
Ooh.

1031
00:59:16,898 --> 00:59:18,969
Okay, that's the idea.

1032
00:59:19,003 --> 00:59:22,110
Time lag here will totally
make me crazy, I am sure.

1033
00:59:22,144 --> 00:59:26,079
We're like in three
totally different times zones.

1034
00:59:26,114 --> 00:59:29,600
And I of course expect to see
perfect unison.

1035
00:59:29,635 --> 00:59:31,844
-Can I do
a synchronization test?

1036
00:59:31,878 --> 00:59:34,743
Six, seven.

1037
00:59:34,778 --> 00:59:36,676
-Uh, Maria is behind.

1038
00:59:36,711 --> 00:59:39,092
One!

1039
00:59:39,127 --> 00:59:41,612
We're like four counts
out of sync.

1040
00:59:41,647 --> 00:59:43,200
Where's the sound?
Hold on.

1041
00:59:43,234 --> 00:59:45,651
We're having a technical
difficulty at the moment.

1042
00:59:45,685 --> 00:59:48,654
Can you understand me, sweetie?
I have no idea.

1043
00:59:48,688 --> 00:59:50,207
-Just got to be able to turn
at the right time.

1044
00:59:50,241 --> 00:59:52,105
-Okay.

1045
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:54,694
-Why can I not understand him?
I need help.

1046
00:59:54,729 --> 00:59:57,870
Maria, can you try to jump
forward one count?

1047
00:59:57,904 --> 00:59:59,112
Charlie, count.

1048
00:59:59,147 --> 01:00:01,874
The problems are manifold.

1049
01:00:01,908 --> 01:00:04,324
It's one thing for me
to get dancers into unison.

1050
01:00:04,359 --> 01:00:08,674
It's another for me to have
a character actually convey

1051
01:00:08,708 --> 01:00:11,711
that they are in love
with this character.

1052
01:00:11,746 --> 01:00:14,162
And I'm not sure
that that is accomplishable.

1053
01:00:16,371 --> 01:00:19,098
Okay. Pretty good.

1054
01:00:19,132 --> 01:00:21,721
Is anybody watching
the screen here at the end

1055
01:00:21,756 --> 01:00:23,412
for our unison phrase?

1056
01:00:23,447 --> 01:00:26,277
We're saying, "Well, really, the
spaces join," and guess what.

1057
01:00:26,312 --> 01:00:27,934
Really, they don't.

1058
01:00:27,969 --> 01:00:30,143
The problem of getting a dancer

1059
01:00:30,178 --> 01:00:33,802
to get exactly to the same point
in their space

1060
01:00:33,837 --> 01:00:36,909
that will read
exactly the same area

1061
01:00:36,943 --> 01:00:38,393
that the other one's
coming in on

1062
01:00:38,427 --> 01:00:40,084
so that they actually --

1063
01:00:40,119 --> 01:00:41,223
Not going to happen.

1064
01:00:43,363 --> 01:00:46,781
Oy. I'm not sure that's
a good enough entry point.

1065
01:00:46,815 --> 01:00:49,404
Uh, I didn't buy that unison.

1066
01:00:49,438 --> 01:00:53,235
I did not perceive that it would
perhaps be as extreme as this.

1067
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:56,204
I'll see you tomorrow.
Thank you very, very much.

1068
01:00:56,238 --> 01:00:59,000
Oh, boy.

1069
01:01:21,194 --> 01:01:24,439
-I had no idea I would end up
working here.

1070
01:01:24,473 --> 01:01:27,166
At age 20,
I started running budgets,

1071
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,203
and we ran the tours.

1072
01:01:30,238 --> 01:01:33,103
And that was
the beginning of my work here.

1073
01:01:33,137 --> 01:01:35,105
I've had so many opportunities

1074
01:01:35,139 --> 01:01:37,901
to experience
all of these projects,

1075
01:01:37,935 --> 01:01:40,282
but in experiencing
these projects,

1076
01:01:40,317 --> 01:01:42,112
I've gotten to know my mom.

1077
01:01:42,146 --> 01:01:44,148
We've got a sustainable
relationship.

1078
01:01:44,183 --> 01:01:48,843
You know, we've gotten to
a point where we're solid.

1079
01:01:48,877 --> 01:01:51,362
-So, honey.
-Yes?

1080
01:01:51,397 --> 01:01:54,952
-You know, we have got
some real issues here.

1081
01:01:54,987 --> 01:01:58,059
I think there's
some humongous problems.

1082
01:01:58,093 --> 01:02:02,028
I mean, you know,
she comes in, in black,

1083
01:02:02,063 --> 01:02:04,065
then she comes in, in yellow.

1084
01:02:04,099 --> 01:02:07,171
One day, Misty's there,
and then she's not.

1085
01:02:07,206 --> 01:02:09,104
Suddenly, she's Charlie.

1086
01:02:09,139 --> 01:02:11,037
I mean, what do we got,
a shape-shifter here?

1087
01:02:13,315 --> 01:02:16,387
The performers --
all four of them are fabulous,

1088
01:02:16,422 --> 01:02:19,390
but it's just technical issues.

1089
01:02:19,425 --> 01:02:22,324
I mean, you know, plus the thing
about all the backgrounds

1090
01:02:22,359 --> 01:02:24,223
are different.

1091
01:02:24,257 --> 01:02:26,812
Nothing feels as though
they're in the same space.

1092
01:02:26,846 --> 01:02:28,192
I mean, do you buy

1093
01:02:28,227 --> 01:02:31,299
that these guys are really
working together?

1094
01:02:31,333 --> 01:02:35,993
I think I like very much that
you're able to be together.

1095
01:02:36,028 --> 01:02:37,443
I like the intimacy.

1096
01:02:37,477 --> 01:02:40,066
Do you feel that you're able
to be intimate?

1097
01:02:40,101 --> 01:02:43,552
-I agree with that.
-This is a whole new territory.

1098
01:02:43,587 --> 01:02:45,175
-I don't know, sweetie.

1099
01:02:45,209 --> 01:02:49,593
It just is, like,
there are so many small flaws.

1100
01:03:30,427 --> 01:03:35,087
-"White Knights" was a film
that was written for Baryshnikov

1101
01:03:35,121 --> 01:03:39,505
and a wonderful tap dancer
named Greg Hines.

1102
01:03:39,539 --> 01:03:42,059
-Whoa!
-Yeah.

1103
01:03:42,094 --> 01:03:44,613
-And then we could continue
somehow from here.

1104
01:03:44,648 --> 01:03:46,029
-Yes. Here.

1105
01:03:46,063 --> 01:03:48,583
My job was to referee.

1106
01:03:48,617 --> 01:03:51,897
The challenge here was that
they were both great dancers,

1107
01:03:51,931 --> 01:03:54,382
but obviously of totally
different backgrounds.

1108
01:03:54,416 --> 01:03:57,419
One's a tap dancer, and the
other's ballet dancer.

1109
01:03:57,454 --> 01:03:59,214
Misha can't tap.

1110
01:03:59,249 --> 01:04:01,251
Greg doesn't have, you know,
a classical technique.

1111
01:04:01,285 --> 01:04:03,598
And it was trying
to get them somehow

1112
01:04:03,632 --> 01:04:05,393
so they could work together.
-We could do something like...

1113
01:04:09,984 --> 01:04:11,537
-I think we're getting
something!

1114
01:04:11,571 --> 01:04:13,159
I think it's called the end.

1115
01:04:13,194 --> 01:04:16,576
We got the end, guys.

1116
01:04:29,106 --> 01:04:32,454
-At the same time I was working
with Misha and Greg,

1117
01:04:32,489 --> 01:04:37,149
I was improvising in the studio
by myself every morning,

1118
01:04:37,183 --> 01:04:39,634
making new material
for a new dance.

1119
01:04:42,430 --> 01:04:46,020
The company had
some really tough times

1120
01:04:46,054 --> 01:04:48,919
with overloads
of one kind and another.

1121
01:04:48,954 --> 01:04:51,404
And in order to make
another piece,

1122
01:04:51,439 --> 01:04:53,199
I had to make it differently.

1123
01:04:53,234 --> 01:04:57,686
It was a culmination.

1124
01:04:57,721 --> 01:05:01,138
"In The Upper Room"
is one of those very rare pieces

1125
01:05:01,173 --> 01:05:02,933
where you just bite
the bullet and say,

1126
01:05:02,968 --> 01:05:05,315
"I'm going to say it all
right here

1127
01:05:05,349 --> 01:05:07,351
and put it all on the line."

1128
01:05:20,744 --> 01:05:22,608
-For "In The Upper Room,"

1129
01:05:22,642 --> 01:05:25,749
I began with
the deeply grounded movement

1130
01:05:25,783 --> 01:05:29,201
of earlier works
in order to make one piece

1131
01:05:29,235 --> 01:05:34,482
that took hold of everything
that I had learned and felt

1132
01:05:34,516 --> 01:05:36,346
and experienced and believed,

1133
01:05:36,380 --> 01:05:39,211
and it was all going
into one dance.

1134
01:05:44,181 --> 01:05:49,497
Phil Glass's music
had a very important role

1135
01:05:49,531 --> 01:05:53,708
in how I heard music
for a very long time.

1136
01:05:53,742 --> 01:05:56,297
I felt a special
kind of power in it,

1137
01:05:56,331 --> 01:05:59,093
and I wanted to commission Phil
to do a score.

1138
01:06:13,762 --> 01:06:16,041
I've had many great experiences

1139
01:06:16,075 --> 01:06:18,595
working with many great
designers,

1140
01:06:18,629 --> 01:06:20,528
but two in particular --

1141
01:06:20,562 --> 01:06:23,358
Jennifer Tipton
and Santo Loquasto --

1142
01:06:23,393 --> 01:06:26,672
have worked with me
in over 50 pieces.

1143
01:06:26,706 --> 01:06:29,192
For "In The Upper Room,"

1144
01:06:29,226 --> 01:06:32,057
they make it possible
for dancers to materialize

1145
01:06:32,091 --> 01:06:35,301
out of thin air
in front of your eyes.

1146
01:06:57,668 --> 01:07:00,326
Once and for all,

1147
01:07:00,361 --> 01:07:03,674
the notion
of the grounded modern world

1148
01:07:03,709 --> 01:07:09,232
can be joined into the lighter,
speedier way of the ballet.

1149
01:07:12,269 --> 01:07:15,410
All of this
would become one work.

1150
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:24,074
Great dancers
are great athletes,

1151
01:07:24,109 --> 01:07:26,594
and this is clear in
"In The Upper Room."

1152
01:07:30,115 --> 01:07:35,568
Performing it requires a blend
of power, grace, flexibility,

1153
01:07:35,603 --> 01:07:38,640
stamina, speed, and heart.

1154
01:07:53,276 --> 01:07:56,555
"In The Upper Room"
was wildly popular,

1155
01:07:56,589 --> 01:07:59,661
and, yes,
everyone wanted it to tour.

1156
01:07:59,696 --> 01:08:04,356
And it could perform
every night of every year

1157
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:06,116
for the rest
of everybody's lives,

1158
01:08:06,151 --> 01:08:08,291
but that was not
what I wanted to do.

1159
01:08:08,325 --> 01:08:10,431
It wasn't what other people
needed to do.

1160
01:08:10,465 --> 01:08:12,295
The machine had taken over.

1161
01:08:12,329 --> 01:08:13,882
We were working for the machine.

1162
01:08:13,917 --> 01:08:15,746
We were working for the company.

1163
01:08:15,781 --> 01:08:17,507
It wasn't working for us.

1164
01:08:17,541 --> 01:08:22,201
We can't fulfill
what's being demanded of us.

1165
01:08:22,236 --> 01:08:24,617
It had to stop.

1166
01:08:24,652 --> 01:08:29,277
The company disbanded,
and I went on to do other work.

1167
01:08:38,286 --> 01:08:40,806
I'd like to begin with --

1168
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:44,361
Charlie is going to be
standing in for Misty tomorrow.

1169
01:08:44,396 --> 01:08:48,434
Misty is not recovered back.

1170
01:08:48,469 --> 01:08:51,334
So Charlie is going
to be stone-shoed.

1171
01:08:59,583 --> 01:09:01,206
Okay, hold it!

1172
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:04,623
Excellent, Charlie and Herman.
Very good.

1173
01:09:04,657 --> 01:09:07,936
Charlie, you want to be out with
the chaÃ®nÃ© by the one, okay?

1174
01:09:07,971 --> 01:09:09,593
You were going -- You were
a hair late getting out.

1175
01:09:09,628 --> 01:09:11,319
Alright, not too bad.

1176
01:09:11,354 --> 01:09:14,219
Thank you, both of you,
very, very much.

1177
01:09:18,015 --> 01:09:20,811
-Hello. Hi, honey. Good morning.

1178
01:09:20,846 --> 01:09:22,537
We're gonna in put on
a piece of music.

1179
01:09:22,572 --> 01:09:24,677
I'm not going to tell you
anything about it.

1180
01:09:24,712 --> 01:09:27,887
Just do it on the timing
you want to use.

1181
01:09:36,413 --> 01:09:39,830
-I've had very classical
training at Vaganova Academy.

1182
01:09:39,865 --> 01:09:40,900
I've never done this before.

1183
01:09:40,935 --> 01:09:43,455
I'm used to doing, like,
all of these arabesques

1184
01:09:43,489 --> 01:09:46,216
and all of the very strict
classical positions.

1185
01:09:46,251 --> 01:09:48,805
So, after I finish
the rond de jambe...

1186
01:09:48,839 --> 01:09:51,014
-Yeah. Yep.

1187
01:09:51,048 --> 01:09:53,948
Yep, yep, yep.

1188
01:09:53,982 --> 01:09:56,709
Right. Now fall. Fall.

1189
01:09:56,744 --> 01:09:57,848
That's it! That's it!

1190
01:09:57,883 --> 01:10:00,713
Tight! Yes, that's it! Right!

1191
01:10:00,748 --> 01:10:02,232
Didn't that feel good, Maria?

1192
01:10:02,267 --> 01:10:04,338
It looked good.

1193
01:10:07,341 --> 01:10:12,863
-Twyla pushed me into making
discoveries about myself.

1194
01:10:12,898 --> 01:10:17,454
Twyla is really opening
the artistic freedom.

1195
01:10:17,489 --> 01:10:19,525
-Talk to me.
How did that feel?

1196
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:21,355
Unsafe?
-It's thrilling in a way.

1197
01:10:21,389 --> 01:10:23,771
Like, it's exciting.
-Oh, that's good.

1198
01:10:23,805 --> 01:10:27,326
-No, it's very interesting for
me to explore things like this

1199
01:10:27,361 --> 01:10:29,259
because I'm always like,
you know, like this.

1200
01:10:29,294 --> 01:10:30,985
But I want to break free
a little bit, you know?

1201
01:10:31,019 --> 01:10:32,400
-Right. Okay.

1202
01:10:32,435 --> 01:10:34,747
This is one of the things that

1203
01:10:34,782 --> 01:10:39,338
I would like to be
able to impart to you.

1204
01:10:39,373 --> 01:10:43,308
Keep your technique
for your whole career.

1205
01:10:43,342 --> 01:10:44,481
It's beautiful.

1206
01:10:44,516 --> 01:10:46,311
Don't ever lose it.

1207
01:10:46,345 --> 01:10:48,589
But learn how to work around it.

1208
01:10:48,623 --> 01:10:50,763
You pass through academically
correct

1209
01:10:50,798 --> 01:10:54,042
and go somewhere else with it
and come back to it.

1210
01:10:54,077 --> 01:10:57,011
Alright. Thank you, Maria.
-Thank you so much.

1211
01:10:57,045 --> 01:10:58,633
-I'll see you soon.
-Thank you.

1212
01:11:00,014 --> 01:11:03,017
-I never stopped working
with dancers.

1213
01:11:03,051 --> 01:11:05,571
We toured.
We made new work.

1214
01:11:05,606 --> 01:11:09,299
And in 2002,
we were back on Broadway.

1215
01:11:14,408 --> 01:11:16,824
-I had made some movement
on Billy's music,

1216
01:11:16,858 --> 01:11:18,481
which I showed him.

1217
01:11:18,515 --> 01:11:20,862
Billy says, "I like that.
What do you want from me?"

1218
01:11:20,897 --> 01:11:23,313
I said, "All your music."
He said, "Okay."

1219
01:11:23,348 --> 01:11:24,797
About three hours later,

1220
01:11:24,832 --> 01:11:26,868
I have every single album
he ever made.

1221
01:11:26,903 --> 01:11:28,836
I put them
in chronological order.

1222
01:11:28,870 --> 01:11:30,769
I listened to them
from first to last.

1223
01:11:30,803 --> 01:11:33,427
I call him up three days later.
I said, "Okay, I have it."

1224
01:11:38,742 --> 01:11:41,020
-This is "Movin' Out,"

1225
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:44,886
the first Broadway show starring
the magic of Twyla Tharp

1226
01:11:44,921 --> 01:11:48,096
and the music of Billy Joel.

1227
01:11:48,131 --> 01:11:51,065
Call Ticketmaster now.

1228
01:11:56,933 --> 01:12:00,385
-"Sing to me, Muse,
of the rage of Achilles."

1229
01:12:00,419 --> 01:12:02,697
It is Odysseus.

1230
01:12:02,732 --> 01:12:05,942
So, it is the hero
and the hero's return.

1231
01:12:05,976 --> 01:12:10,740
So, I heard in Eddie
his return after the war,

1232
01:12:10,774 --> 01:12:11,913
after the Vietnam war,

1233
01:12:11,948 --> 01:12:15,400
and the steps, the trials
he would have to go through

1234
01:12:15,434 --> 01:12:18,817
were those
of the returning warriors,

1235
01:12:18,851 --> 01:12:22,441
veterans from the Vietnam war

1236
01:12:22,476 --> 01:12:26,445
and the ways in which this
culture basically spat on them.

1237
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:29,068
And that was the spine
of "Movin' Out."

1238
01:12:39,424 --> 01:12:42,530
And she had a vision in her head
about what she wanted.

1239
01:12:42,565 --> 01:12:45,153
It was so intense.

1240
01:12:45,188 --> 01:12:47,466
It was something
I couldn't say no to.

1241
01:12:47,501 --> 01:12:51,815
A lot of energy in a small
woman, almost intimidating.

1242
01:12:51,850 --> 01:12:53,541
And I thought, "Oh, this is
somebody who's --"

1243
01:12:53,576 --> 01:12:54,853
You don't want to get
in the way.

1244
01:12:54,887 --> 01:12:56,613
Like, get out of her way.

1245
01:12:56,648 --> 01:12:58,788
And that's how
the collaboration worked.

1246
01:12:58,822 --> 01:13:01,515
I pretty much stayed out
of the way, and she ran it.

1247
01:13:10,731 --> 01:13:12,871
Alright, here we go!

1248
01:13:12,905 --> 01:13:15,667
I'm a songwriter --
I'm literal.

1249
01:13:15,701 --> 01:13:18,980
I didn't really know
where she was going,

1250
01:13:19,015 --> 01:13:23,813
how to connect the songs and
make it work all as one piece

1251
01:13:23,847 --> 01:13:25,746
'cause they're individual songs.

1252
01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:30,613
But she was doing an allegory
with the lyrics.

1253
01:13:30,647 --> 01:13:33,650
And I don't -- That had never
been attempted before.

1254
01:13:33,685 --> 01:13:35,652
I was scared to death.

1255
01:13:35,687 --> 01:13:38,828
But she had the confidence
and the vision

1256
01:13:38,862 --> 01:13:40,208
to know it was going to work.

1257
01:13:44,696 --> 01:13:48,493
And these people are throwing
themselves around the stage.

1258
01:13:48,527 --> 01:13:51,185
You know, I was worried
about people getting injured.

1259
01:13:51,219 --> 01:13:54,947
It was so energetic
and so physically demanding.

1260
01:13:54,982 --> 01:13:58,054
You know, I felt like,
"Take it easy," you know?

1261
01:13:58,088 --> 01:14:00,263
"Watch out. Watch out
for the edge of the stage."

1262
01:14:00,297 --> 01:14:02,990
They were, like, risking
life and limb every night.

1263
01:14:20,939 --> 01:14:25,012
-Here I am in this impasse
with this Zoom quandary.

1264
01:14:25,046 --> 01:14:26,738
We're in all their
living spaces,

1265
01:14:26,772 --> 01:14:28,222
and I'm trying to make
theater out of it.

1266
01:14:28,256 --> 01:14:30,155
Who else are you going to call
but Santo?

1267
01:14:30,189 --> 01:14:32,847
-He's here.
-Hello.

1268
01:14:32,882 --> 01:14:35,609
Santo makes
theatrical experiences.

1269
01:14:35,643 --> 01:14:36,782
-How you doing?

1270
01:14:36,817 --> 01:14:40,268
-We need unity. He'll fix it.

1271
01:14:40,303 --> 01:14:42,788
They're in totally
different spaces.

1272
01:14:42,823 --> 01:14:44,100
That's the biggest problem.

1273
01:14:44,134 --> 01:14:46,654
And I'm trying to connect them
into a narrative.

1274
01:14:46,689 --> 01:14:49,105
If you were doing it properly,
they'd all be on the same set,

1275
01:14:49,139 --> 01:14:51,556
you'd have your crew,
you'd have it all set up.

1276
01:14:51,590 --> 01:14:53,316
-But it will ultimately
be like that?

1277
01:14:53,350 --> 01:14:56,008
-No.
-Oh, it will remain on Zoom.

1278
01:14:56,043 --> 01:14:57,941
-It will remain --

1279
01:14:57,976 --> 01:15:00,530
-It remains virtual,
as they say.

1280
01:15:00,565 --> 01:15:02,014
-It remains virtual.

1281
01:15:02,049 --> 01:15:04,638
You don't have a crew.
You don't have hair.

1282
01:15:04,672 --> 01:15:06,812
You don't have
all of the elements.

1283
01:15:06,847 --> 01:15:08,296
Your lighting is never going
to be comparable.

1284
01:15:08,331 --> 01:15:10,057
You are screwed.

1285
01:15:10,091 --> 01:15:13,854
Why don't we look at that
and see what it actually is?

1286
01:17:46,454 --> 01:17:48,387
It's fun.
-Oh, you're so cute.

1287
01:17:48,422 --> 01:17:50,355
I actually got a chuckle.
-It's --

1288
01:17:50,389 --> 01:17:53,289
-You warmed my heart.
-Well, you know, it's Jewish.

1289
01:17:53,323 --> 01:17:56,223
-Yeah, I know it's Jewish.
I did know that.

1290
01:17:56,257 --> 01:17:58,915
I knew I could bias you
that way.

1291
01:17:58,950 --> 01:18:01,262
-That's alright. I mean,
you know, what can I say?

1292
01:18:01,297 --> 01:18:02,850
Irresistible.
-Yes.

1293
01:18:02,885 --> 01:18:04,818
-Um...
-So, you see the issues.

1294
01:18:04,852 --> 01:18:06,820
Really, my question is this --

1295
01:18:06,854 --> 01:18:09,995
do you feel that it would be
more effective

1296
01:18:10,030 --> 01:18:13,447
if the backgrounds were alike?

1297
01:18:13,481 --> 01:18:17,002
If we had a void, which is
how we would shoot this

1298
01:18:17,037 --> 01:18:18,728
if we had them
all in one place --

1299
01:18:18,763 --> 01:18:22,283
-I love the funkiness of this.

1300
01:18:22,318 --> 01:18:24,734
-You do?

1301
01:18:24,769 --> 01:18:25,908
Been on Broadway too long.

1302
01:18:25,942 --> 01:18:29,256
-It's short.
-It's very short.

1303
01:18:29,290 --> 01:18:31,223
-I think it will become

1304
01:18:31,258 --> 01:18:33,916
like early dance in America,
if you will.

1305
01:18:33,950 --> 01:18:36,263
-Ah!
-Oh!

1306
01:18:36,297 --> 01:18:38,092
-We were early dance in America,
if you'll recall.

1307
01:18:38,127 --> 01:18:41,440
-Oh, that was you!
-That was us!

1308
01:18:41,475 --> 01:18:43,373
That was you, too!

1309
01:18:43,408 --> 01:18:45,859
-But you know what I mean.
-I do know what you mean.

1310
01:18:45,893 --> 01:18:49,034
-I worry that it looks as though
we're trying for something

1311
01:18:49,069 --> 01:18:51,278
which will be...

1312
01:18:51,312 --> 01:18:52,935
-Not accomplishable,

1313
01:18:52,969 --> 01:18:55,178
which is what I wanted
to talk to you about.

1314
01:18:55,213 --> 01:18:57,940
-No, no, this is --
this is very good

1315
01:18:57,974 --> 01:19:00,114
because it feels so unedited.

1316
01:19:00,149 --> 01:19:02,565
-Okay.
-I think it's quite marvelous.

1317
01:19:02,599 --> 01:19:04,049
Well, you've been busy.

1318
01:19:04,084 --> 01:19:06,465
-Thank you.
Yeah, right.

1319
01:19:08,985 --> 01:19:13,231
I have been very busy,
very, very busy,

1320
01:19:13,265 --> 01:19:17,166
for this allows me to be
in the company of dancers.

1321
01:20:03,039 --> 01:20:06,215
-Dancers give me their hopes
and their dreams,

1322
01:20:06,249 --> 01:20:12,048
and together we work to redefine
what is possible,

1323
01:20:12,083 --> 01:20:18,572
for they will find unimaginable
solutions to my dilemmas.

1324
01:20:18,606 --> 01:20:22,541
All dancers know that
there is only one way out,

1325
01:20:22,576 --> 01:20:25,959
and that is forward.

1326
01:20:49,361 --> 01:20:53,227
-So I can only say thank you
to so many dancers

1327
01:20:53,262 --> 01:20:57,128
who have sustained
my belief in tomorrow.

1328
01:20:57,162 --> 01:21:01,028
And thank you for your help
in digging us out

1329
01:21:01,063 --> 01:21:04,031
every single time.

1330
01:21:08,001 --> 01:21:10,417
Do I feel like overall
I've completed my mission?

1331
01:21:10,451 --> 01:21:12,453
Not yet.
