3
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:34,750
Shit.

4
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,416
Perfect.

5
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:58,750
Auntie Opal's here!

6
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:01,791
Late as hell, per usual.

7
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:05,291
Where's my birthday girl?

8
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:06,708
Party was at 4:00.

9
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:09,833
You have to stop doing this to her.

10
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:13,750
I'm late for work.
I'll see you in the morning.

11
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:28,166
Auntie Opal's special recipe,
mac and cheese.

12
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,833
So good, it'll bring you to your knees!

13
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:45,083
Well, how about a one-of-a-kind
collector's edition book?

14
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:46,666
Happy birthday, baby.

15
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,083
<i> Leave that in, right?</i>

16
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:54,375
<i>You get the picture.</i>
<i>Take it all out, roll it out, then…</i>

17
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:57,166
Ow! Auntie!

18
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:59,000
Lucky it's me!

19
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:00,666
Your dad used to do mine.

20
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:04,416
Had me looking like
that snake lady we read about.

21
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,458
-Medusa.
-Medusa.

22
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:10,833
Couldn't look at myself in the mirror,
or I'd turn to stone.

23
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,041
Why didn't your mom do it?

24
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:16,958
She wasn't around.

25
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:19,541
Why do moms leave?

26
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,041
Doesn't matter why. They just do.

27
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:26,541
Look, whatever happened, happened.
You can't change it.

28
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:29,125
Just take care of yourself
because no one else will do it, okay?

29
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,083
You know what?

30
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:38,750
Why don't you read that beautiful new book
while I finish this hair?

31
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:46,291
"A guilty heart the auntie had.
Missed Nina's birthday, bad, bad, bad."

32
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,875
Nina, girl, I'm getting to my limit.

33
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:52,458
I got you a nice book!
I said, "Happy Birthday!" Let it go!

34
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,375
It's in the book!

35
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:57,250
The book has a story about
a girl named Nina and her auntie?

36
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:58,166
Yes!

37
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,791
Let me see this book.

38
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:10,083
"Erax smell your fear and doubt."

39
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,916
"They've been stuck in
and now they're out."

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,041
"If you fail, you'll one become.
You have until the sand has run."

41
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:20,041
I guess that's an Erax.

42
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,166
Mm-hm.

43
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:26,458
"It's your story, take the pen,

44
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,708
though growth may be beyond your ken."

45
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:33,916
"Rise up now and earn your wage,
or freeze forever on the page."

46
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,541
Is this the trippiest thing
you've ever seen or what?

47
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:56,958
Wasn't there…

48
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:19,750
Huh?

49
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:06,625
Auntie!

50
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,833
Mac and cheese is so good.

51
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,875
They took the book!

52
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:20,833
What? No, No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

53
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:25,000
-Are you serious?
-Auntie?

54
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,416
Get that book.

55
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:40,416
Oh my God!

56
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,875
Get off my auntie!

57
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,458
Where'd it go?

58
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:01,583
Hm?

59
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,750
How are you eating
popcorn right now?

60
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:19,375
Uh, when did you get so sassy?
Chill out. We're safe now.

61
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,416
That popcorn's older than me.

62
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:26,750
I don't want to be disrespectful,
but we have to make a plan.

63
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,541
Yeah, the plan is to hide up here
until somebody comes.

64
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,333
Where is it?

65
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,500
-Chubs!
-Huh?

66
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,750
Wow! Look at this!

67
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,875
Sounds like
they're tearing up the house.

68
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,291
That Erax is back in here.

69
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,458
That's what the poem means!

70
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:55,666
We have to get the Erax back in the book
before the hourglass runs out,

71
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,541
or we become one of them.

72
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:03,208
"Freeze forever on the page."

73
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:07,416
Look, I'm sorry, but that's insane,
and that can't happen.

74
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,916
Everything that's happening now
is insane and can't happen.

75
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,875
The sand is almost out.

76
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,208
Get the book.

77
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:23,708
Watch out for the bad step!

78
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:26,125
I know about the bad step!

79
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,541
Auntie! Dang!

80
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:30,625
What?

81
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:07,500
Oh, fuck.

82
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:08,750
Time to go!

83
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:12,833
I understand that time is running out.

84
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:15,583
I understand that time is running out.

85
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:18,166
Running, running, running, running!
Time's gonna run out!

86
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,250
Get on the bed. Now!

87
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:29,875
Auntie.

88
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:32,791
Nina, girl…

89
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:38,250
-It's getting through!
-Nina, Nina, Nina, listen to me.

90
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,708
I'm sorry, Nina.

91
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:42,541
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I missed your birthday.

92
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:45,208
I'm sorry for every time
I didn't own up to my mistakes.

93
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:49,541
And I was wrong about that "looking out
for yourself and no one else" crap.

94
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,208
Baby, I got you.

95
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,083
I got you.

96
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,541
You want to get fictional?

97
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,791
Let's get fictional!

98
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:29,833
Auntie!

99
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:20,291
That was some
straight superhero thumping, girl!

100
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,666
You kind of stole my moment, but…

101
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,791
Want to read another one?

102
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
No.

103
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,875
We're on the set of <i>Erax.</i>

104
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,458
Here I'm gonna bite her leg.

105
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,333
-Oh my God!
-Me tasty!

106
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,166
Um…no, no.

107
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:19,666
Okay!

108
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,083
That was a good one.

109
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,875
Get off my auntie!

110
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,208
Hot damn!

111
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:34,541
Oh geez!

112
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,875
Sorry, Berserker. Showbiz.

113
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:47,541
Oh!
