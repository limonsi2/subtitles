0
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:36,797
So, what did he do?

1
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:40,000
It's what he's gonna do.

2
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:44,605
Fuck's sake. Davids!
Eyes on the road.

3
00:01:56,284 --> 00:01:57,285
Davids!

4
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:08,255
Go and check on them.

5
00:03:08,256 --> 00:03:09,823
Get with the fucking program.

6
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,287
Stay with the informant.

7
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:24,657
Oh, thanks, man.

8
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,125
Did Mike send you?

9
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:27,494
Oh, fuck, man.

10
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:29,530
Did you kill them all?

11
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:45,578
Wait, wait.

12
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:46,980
Who sent you?

13
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,649
Please, man.

14
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,918
I'll give you whatever you want.

15
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,220
You have nothing I want.

16
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:55,822
I have kids.

17
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:58,391
Please. There's money.

18
00:05:58,392 --> 00:05:59,759
Loads of it.

19
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,995
You can get out
of the game like me, man.

20
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:06,599
Why would I want that?

21
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,868
Who are you?

22
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,440
I'm nobody.

23
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:40,200
Fuck.

24
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:07,794
Speak.

25
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:09,929
I've lost a witness.

26
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,364
He saw my face.

27
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:15,602
I've been made.

28
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:16,969
Share your location.

29
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,508
We'll send a car.
Time for you to disappear again.

30
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:52,825
Ah, you like to keep
the night shift busy, don't you?

31
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:54,226
Because you're always here.

32
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:56,095
I heard you were back.

33
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,596
Always a pleasure, Forge.

34
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,798
You've been here so many times,

35
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,835
it's easy to fast-track
a new identity for you.

36
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:06,173
I'll get your new documents
turned over.

37
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:08,776
Tonight.

38
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:12,045
Please.

39
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:15,748
You're not
the only resident tonight.

40
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:17,817
Some particularly
nefarious types

41
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:20,987
who won't take kindly
to queue jumpers.

42
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:22,454
I'll see what I can do.

43
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,489
Thank you.

44
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,624
Good night, Walker.

45
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,826
Smithee.

46
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:27,827
Good night.

47
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:29,328
Get him processed
before lockdown.

48
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:31,831
Right.
Personals are next.

49
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:32,866
Follow me.

50
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:34,835
- Hey.
- Oh.

51
00:10:34,836 --> 00:10:35,935
Just the man I need.

52
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:37,469
Me?
You... you... you need me?

53
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,305
Uh, I mean yes.
I... I can help.

54
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,307
What... what... what do you need?

55
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,275
Uh, just the keys
to the upstairs office.

56
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:45,477
Oh, uh...
o... o... of course.

57
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,313
Um... when...

58
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,749
When the renovation is done
and it's all electronic, you...

59
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,083
You won't need me as much.

60
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:52,352
Not the keys at least.

61
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:55,756
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

62
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:59,058
Um, what is it?
It's not this one.

63
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:00,659
Ah.

64
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,330
Sorry, it's a bit stiff.

65
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,232
Here. This one.

66
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:07,233
Yes.

67
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:11,003
Perfect. Thanks.

68
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,039
Thanks.

69
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:14,541
Perfect...

70
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,277
what?

71
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:19,478
Come on.

72
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:20,780
All right.

73
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:21,749
Locking down

74
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,582
will commence in 15 minutes.

75
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,284
A word of advice.

76
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:26,986
For me?
What... what for?

77
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:29,055
When a girl
opens a door for you,

78
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:32,525
do everyone a favor
and walk through it.

79
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:34,827
- Smithee.
- Smithee.

80
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:37,496
Doesn't that get confusing?

81
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:38,765
Coming from someone
who has a new name

82
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:40,868
nearly every week.

83
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,170
Fair.

84
00:11:43,171 --> 00:11:45,038
Just watch your step,
huh, Mr. Walker.

85
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,342
Ah, right.

86
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:52,980
No attempting to contact anyone
outside the facility.

87
00:11:54,782 --> 00:11:55,982
You know about
the signal jammer?

88
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:57,649
Yes.

89
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:58,952
Dietary require...

90
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:06,425
So, I guess that's not relevant
to you, is it?

91
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:09,228
Hm. No?

92
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:12,632
Okay.

93
00:12:16,804 --> 00:12:17,805
That it?

94
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:30,049
As always,
you'll be locked in overnight.

95
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,318
It's still the best way to keep
everyone minding their business

96
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:34,654
during the night shift's
minimal security.

97
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:38,291
At least until we upgrade.

98
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,727
The case, sir.

99
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:42,728
This stays with me.

100
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:44,263
I don't think
you understand, sir.

101
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,832
Nothing stays with you.

102
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,099
I don't think you understand,

103
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,968
ya fucking tea leaf
little prick.

104
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:50,302
This case stays with me.

105
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,603
Right, fingerprints.

106
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,204
Am I going to
have to call security, sir?

107
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:55,808
Why the fuck you calling me sir?

108
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:57,477
Chop-chop, Mr. Walker.

109
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:06,419
I assure you,
it's for the system to work.

110
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,441
You get your ass...

111
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:11,111
Sir, I...

112
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:41,607
On schedule, I see.
Keep this up

113
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,342
and I'll start
believing I can rely on you.

114
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:45,277
Yes, sir.

115
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,247
The place is about to lock down.

116
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:50,316
Security is as easy
as we thought.

117
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:51,317
Now, that's the problem

118
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:53,819
when goodwill
is your main security protocol.

119
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,488
It tends to expire.
Especially mine.

120
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,824
I've sent you the target.
Make this neat.

121
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:01,927
Make this tidy.
No witnesses.

122
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:06,299
I want her breathing.
Otherwise, you won't be.

123
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,178
Get Keates.

124
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:21,180
Wait.

125
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:25,484
And the details of every single
fucker inside these walls.

126
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,519
No one survives.

127
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,160
This is gonna be fun.

128
00:16:50,277 --> 00:16:51,278
What's she look like?

129
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:55,615
Not your type.

130
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,487
Yours?

131
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,160
Either way, she's dead.

132
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:09,362
Alive, Keates.

133
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:15,368
All right, guys,
let's draw some blood.

134
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:51,298
Locking doors for lockdown.

135
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:01,307
Ah! Oh, ah.

136
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:03,642
- Sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Don't do that.

137
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:04,910
- I... I... I just, um...
- Oh, gosh.

138
00:19:04,911 --> 00:19:08,780
You almost gave me
a heart... attack...

139
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:09,948
- In fact...
- Oh, God.

140
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:11,917
Oh, God. Um...

141
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:16,322
Oh, your face is priceless.

142
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:18,924
Just... just...
Just wanted to say bye.

143
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:21,126
S... s... sorry.
Bye-bye then.

144
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:24,296
I got the new
Freedom Alliance box set,

145
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:25,664
all six seasons.

146
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:28,066
Maybe you could come and
watch them with me next week...

147
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:32,103
If you want to watch them,
I mean.

148
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,772
- Is that the door?
- Huh?

149
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:36,808
Hm? I mean,
uh, y... y... yes.

150
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:38,910
That... that would be lovely.

151
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,145
Great.

152
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:44,049
Um, so I got these with
the Freedom Alliance box set.

153
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,551
I... I don't know
if you want them.

154
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:47,118
Freedom Alliance pens.

155
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,087
These... these were
limited edition.

156
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:50,889
I... I saw you, you know,

157
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,424
looking on the internet
and stuff for them

158
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:55,327
and I just figured
they'd end up in my drawers.

159
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:58,597
So, I will see you next week.

160
00:19:58,598 --> 00:19:59,765
Not if I see you first.
But that...

161
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:00,766
But I do... I...

162
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:03,335
I do want to see you
first... last... sorry.

163
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:05,772
- Six seasons, remember?
- To the future.

164
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:42,609
Showtime, boys.

165
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:16,828

179
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:11,050
Security breach.
Shutting down.

180
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,655
Please immediately.

181
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:18,591
Security breach.

182
00:24:27,033 --> 00:24:28,266
We don't have much time.

183
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:29,501
We need your help.

184
00:24:29,502 --> 00:24:30,502
Do I know you?

185
00:24:30,503 --> 00:24:32,904
No, but I know you.

186
00:24:32,905 --> 00:24:34,773
Get out of my room.

187
00:24:34,774 --> 00:24:36,975
- I'm...
- No personal details.

188
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:39,678
We need your help.

189
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,580
Lock the door on the way out.

190
00:24:41,581 --> 00:24:42,914
The compound's been sieged.

191
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:44,716
They want us dead.

192
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:46,317
That sounds like
a "you" problem.

193
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,588
Or you could just
wait to get shot.

194
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:54,492
You're obviously
not who I thought you were.

195
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:58,698
Sorry to disappoint.

196
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:01,534
Juliet.

197
00:25:15,381 --> 00:25:16,549
The key!

198
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:55,087
Security breach.

199
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:31,482
Do you know how to use that?

200
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:35,121
Says the guy
who has a bullet in his arm.

201
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:38,758
Touché.

202
00:27:41,928 --> 00:27:43,494
Do you want me
to come back later?

203
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,996
- Wanna help now, do you?
- No.

204
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:47,999
But you left my door open
and got me shot.

205
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,368
Serves you right.

206
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:51,803
These guys have firepower.

207
00:27:51,804 --> 00:27:53,004
We need more weapons.

208
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,005
There's no we.

209
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:55,173
And who the fuck are these guys?

210
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:56,842
And she's definitely
not supposed to be...

211
00:27:56,843 --> 00:27:58,676
"She" is stood right here.

212
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,445
Come on.

213
00:28:00,446 --> 00:28:01,446
Juliet.

214
00:28:01,447 --> 00:28:02,781
This one is on you.

215
00:28:02,782 --> 00:28:03,950
Get down there.

216
00:28:53,132 --> 00:28:54,452
I must stop
finding you like this.

217
00:28:57,036 --> 00:28:58,269
I had it under control.

218
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,305
Yeah. Clearly.

219
00:29:05,011 --> 00:29:06,779
What you looking at?

220
00:29:13,953 --> 00:29:14,921
We need to move.

221
00:29:14,922 --> 00:29:16,321
We've got to get
to the weapons lockup

222
00:29:16,322 --> 00:29:17,824
if we're going to
weather this storm.

223
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,128
You're bleeding.

224
00:29:22,129 --> 00:29:23,594
I'm fine. Take this.

225
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,297
Let's go.

226
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:28,399
- Are you coming?
- We can't trust him.

227
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,600
You came to me.

228
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,336
When someone shows me
who they are, I believe them.

229
00:29:31,337 --> 00:29:32,737
- We need him.
- He doesn't need you,

230
00:29:32,738 --> 00:29:34,773
- I'm afraid.
- Prick.

231
00:31:27,186 --> 00:31:29,320
Hey, any eyes on the little one?

232
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:30,588
Nope.

233
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:31,889
You got a light?

234
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,925
Sure.

235
00:31:36,963 --> 00:31:38,396
So, you seen her picture?

236
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:39,531
No, have you?

237
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:43,001
Let's put it this way.

238
00:31:43,002 --> 00:31:45,736
If it's me against,
she won't be walking for a week.

239
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:46,772
You're sick.

240
00:31:51,043 --> 00:31:52,843
Oy, we only had
a couple of puffs.

241
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:54,380
Don't waste it.

242
00:32:04,023 --> 00:32:06,192
Dad.

243
00:32:16,502 --> 00:32:17,503
Oy.

244
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:20,471
That was easy.

245
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:22,274
Come on, princess.

246
00:32:32,018 --> 00:32:33,451
I was trying to
keep this quiet but...

247
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:34,520
You're welcome.

248
00:32:35,821 --> 00:32:36,988
You okay?

249
00:32:36,989 --> 00:32:38,056
Yeah.

250
00:32:38,057 --> 00:32:39,358
Let's go.

251
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:52,837
To the weapons.

252
00:32:52,838 --> 00:32:55,406
I need guns, phasers.
Set phasers.

253
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:57,742
I have three phasers,
limited edition,

254
00:32:57,743 --> 00:33:00,778
original boxes.
Just pull yourself together.

255
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:02,080
I need to get to the weapons.

256
00:33:02,081 --> 00:33:04,450
Don't die. Live long...

257
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:08,153
Okay. No guns.

258
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:10,589
No guns. No guns.

259
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,442
How did you know it was there?

260
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:33,845
It's where I would put it.

261
00:33:36,115 --> 00:33:37,516
Argh.

262
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,624
What are you looking for?

263
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:49,195
Keys to the gun closet.

264
00:34:03,942 --> 00:34:06,010
Just the man we need.

265
00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:09,047
Gosh, I'd hate to be
the man you didn't need.

266
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:13,851
What's that doing on the floor?

267
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,421
What's that doing on the floor?

268
00:34:16,422 --> 00:34:19,590
We need the keys
to the gun closet.

269
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:20,791
The guns, Smithee.

270
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:21,927
What guns?

271
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:24,262
Oh, those guns.

272
00:34:24,263 --> 00:34:26,631
Oh, no, not on me.
Not that one.

273
00:34:26,632 --> 00:34:28,833
I know we look ramshackle
at the moment,

274
00:34:28,834 --> 00:34:31,001
but some things have to remain
pretty secure,

275
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:33,404
firearms being priority, but...

276
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:34,772
But what?

277
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:37,642
Have you checked the
in-tray of unprocessed items?

278
00:34:37,643 --> 00:34:38,844
The in-tray?

279
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:51,789
The in-tray.

280
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:52,824
No guns, but...

281
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,794
Yes.
It's very nice.

282
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:58,963
What are these?

283
00:34:58,964 --> 00:35:00,398
Smoke grenades.

284
00:35:00,399 --> 00:35:02,733
Save your pocket
for something more useful.

285
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:04,970
I don't know.
I think it might come in handy.

286
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:10,409
Be careful with that.

287
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:12,010
I'm not quite sure
why it was checked in.

288
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:14,779
Oh, that's what it does.

289
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,846
Give it to me.

290
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:17,048
Very MI6.

291
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,187
The weapons lockout,
it's down here.

292
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:25,424
Juliet, get ready
with that smoke.

293
00:35:47,546 --> 00:35:50,516
Juliet, smoke!

294
00:37:05,691 --> 00:37:06,925
Gosh.

295
00:37:08,594 --> 00:37:09,795
Ha! Ugh!

296
00:37:18,604 --> 00:37:20,838
I'm... I'm not gonna die?

297
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:22,441
No.
You're gonna be fine.

298
00:37:23,442 --> 00:37:24,610
Thank you.

299
00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:28,213
Ugh.

300
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:33,918
S... so sorry.

301
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:35,186
It's okay.

302
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,544
Fuck.

303
00:38:03,148 --> 00:38:05,050
We gotta get
that bullet out of you.

304
00:38:07,586 --> 00:38:09,321
I'll be fine.

305
00:38:10,322 --> 00:38:12,691
There has to be some
medical shit in the lab.

306
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:32,109
Are you okay?

307
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:36,113
Yeah. Just hot.

308
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:37,683
I'm fine, thanks.

309
00:38:42,354 --> 00:38:44,154
You've been knocked up.

310
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,657
The cause of all this?

311
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:47,925
You don't need to
know the details.

312
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:49,827
I'm here
with a piece of crap in my leg

313
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:51,996
because you two
is too incompetent

314
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:53,330
to lock a fucking door.

315
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,999
Don't tell me
what I need to know.

316
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,166
Mention that one more time.

317
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,267
Argh!

318
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:59,304
I dare you.

319
00:39:02,207 --> 00:39:04,174
- I'm fine.
- The baby?

320
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,977
Hopefully not.

321
00:39:08,647 --> 00:39:11,483
Argh!

322
00:39:17,923 --> 00:39:19,591
I'm waiting.

323
00:39:21,627 --> 00:39:23,761
Our work requires
we don't ask questions.

324
00:39:23,762 --> 00:39:24,762
Don't get attached.

325
00:39:24,763 --> 00:39:27,231
Something
you are totally incapable of.

326
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,468
This time...
I couldn't walk away.

327
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,303
Why?

328
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:35,339
Let's just say at some point,

329
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:38,510
your past refuses to stay... past.

330
00:39:39,978 --> 00:39:43,013
I got involved
in a kidnapping...

331
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:44,215
four women.

332
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:47,218
Sex trafficking?

333
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:52,791
Who was she sold to?

334
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:54,992
There was a buyer,

335
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:57,995
but the boss
took a liking to her.

336
00:39:57,996 --> 00:40:00,297
Even more so when he found out
about the baby.

337
00:40:00,298 --> 00:40:02,033
These rings are impenetrable.

338
00:40:03,268 --> 00:40:06,437
But when he decided
he wanted to keep her,

339
00:40:06,438 --> 00:40:09,507
it caused problems, delays.

340
00:40:09,508 --> 00:40:11,442
Delays which gave me opportunity.

341
00:40:11,443 --> 00:40:12,477
To steal her.

342
00:40:12,478 --> 00:40:13,811
Stealing implies ownership.

343
00:40:13,812 --> 00:40:16,548
That's how they all see it.

344
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:28,293
This past of yours...?

345
00:40:30,496 --> 00:40:32,931
Hit a little close, did it?

346
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:39,103
My life in this world...

347
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:41,773
all started when
I was stolen as a child,

348
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:47,813
in broad daylight,
from the streets of Naples.

349
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:52,082
I won't let those things
happen anymore to others.

350
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:53,384
Not on my watch.

351
00:40:55,353 --> 00:40:57,689
No more innocence destroyed.

352
00:41:00,492 --> 00:41:03,629
You used to do the same.
Protect innocence.

353
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:08,666
Getting emotionally attached...

354
00:41:08,667 --> 00:41:10,536
only leads to one thing...

355
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:14,506
just ask Smithee.

356
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:23,682
The baby, is it his?

357
00:41:28,353 --> 00:41:29,486
I need to call my handler.

358
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,588
What? No.

359
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:32,890
He's the only man
on this planet I trust.

360
00:41:32,891 --> 00:41:34,258
We can't trust anyone.

361
00:41:34,259 --> 00:41:36,194
You have a better solution?

362
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:39,998
Fine.

363
00:41:39,999 --> 00:41:42,132
We need to
deactivate the signal jammer

364
00:41:42,133 --> 00:41:44,001
to get a call out.

365
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,936
You stay here.

366
00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:49,506
I need to... to turn off
the signal jammer.

367
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:50,709
Where's that?

368
00:41:52,377 --> 00:41:53,678
Security cabin.

369
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:54,812
Let me go.

370
00:41:54,813 --> 00:41:56,781
I can walk this off.

371
00:41:56,782 --> 00:41:59,116
I can walk now.

372
00:41:59,117 --> 00:42:00,686
Just keep her alive.

373
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,056
I can do that.

374
00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:07,826
You make sure he does.

375
00:42:48,366 --> 00:42:51,568
This man, what is he like?

376
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:52,638
Pure evil.

377
00:43:06,217 --> 00:43:08,019
What's that around your neck?

378
00:43:12,123 --> 00:43:13,692
Nothing.

379
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:15,994
You got family?

380
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:20,966
Not anymore.

381
00:43:23,835 --> 00:43:25,370
I'm sorry.

382
00:43:28,707 --> 00:43:31,810
My job is easier alone anyway.

383
00:43:34,379 --> 00:43:38,515
If it's easier alone,
why did you help us?

384
00:43:38,516 --> 00:43:39,885
Elda knew you would.

385
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:43,354
She's done her homework.

386
00:43:44,823 --> 00:43:47,025
She knows my past identities.

387
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:51,161
After long enough,
your past lives become a rumor,

388
00:43:51,162 --> 00:43:52,798
legend even.

389
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:57,234
And she's been around
long enough to hear them.

390
00:43:57,235 --> 00:43:59,069
So, you used to help people

391
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:02,340
and then you stopped,
and now you're helping me?

392
00:44:07,212 --> 00:44:09,781
I'm just trying
to survive the night.

393
00:44:12,818 --> 00:44:14,319
Whatever you say.

394
00:45:42,207 --> 00:45:44,174
You need me, little one.

395
00:45:44,175 --> 00:45:45,844
You know you do.

396
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,681
Drink this.

397
00:45:51,682 --> 00:45:53,250
Thanks.

398
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:55,485
Don't fall asleep.

399
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:58,489
You seem to be moving better.

400
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:02,759
Got more guns.

401
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,462
God, sit down.
Let me look at that.

402
00:46:05,463 --> 00:46:09,100
It's okay.
It's just a scratch.

403
00:46:10,468 --> 00:46:11,969
Jesus, Alexa.

404
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:14,805
Alexa?
Is that your real name?

405
00:46:14,806 --> 00:46:17,574
For now. You?

406
00:46:17,575 --> 00:46:20,211
Scott, for now.

407
00:46:26,551 --> 00:46:30,320
Mission successful.
Except for a few mishaps.

408
00:46:30,321 --> 00:46:33,490
It's only
a small stab wound to the chest.

409
00:46:33,491 --> 00:46:35,792
The only thing
we need now is phones.

410
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,661
The cloakroom.

411
00:46:37,662 --> 00:46:39,830
You able to function
on that leg now?

412
00:46:39,831 --> 00:46:41,466
I have to.

413
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:44,101
Okay. Okay. I'm done.

414
00:46:44,102 --> 00:46:47,737
I'm done. That's cute.

415
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:49,139
Yeah.

416
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:52,409
Even when in the dirtiest
of waters,

417
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:56,513
a lotus still produces
the most amazing flower.

418
00:46:56,514 --> 00:46:58,648
I love that.

419
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,084
It's a symbol of rebirth.

420
00:47:00,085 --> 00:47:02,752
Okay, okay,
I've got a sensitive side.

421
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:04,422
We get it.

422
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:08,326
Breathe.

423
00:47:08,327 --> 00:47:10,794
Is she okay?

424
00:47:10,795 --> 00:47:12,897
I'm fine.

425
00:47:12,898 --> 00:47:15,200
This time, we stick together.

426
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:19,537
Someone needs to make sure
you don't get stabbed.

427
00:47:21,372 --> 00:47:24,174
She's killed three of our men

428
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:27,311
to get to a signal jammer,
and there's no sign of the girl.

429
00:47:27,312 --> 00:47:30,080
So, what exactly
are you still doing out here?

430
00:47:30,081 --> 00:47:32,582
Useless morons.
I'm going in.

431
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:35,152
The girl alive, Keates.

432
00:47:35,153 --> 00:47:37,422
Are you gonna make yourself
useful or what?

433
00:47:47,465 --> 00:47:49,334
I don't know about you but...

434
00:47:51,002 --> 00:47:54,539
I think the time
for subtlety's over.

435
00:47:58,977 --> 00:48:02,547
He always needs
something big to hide behind.

436
00:48:19,497 --> 00:48:21,666
This place is a bloody maze.

437
00:48:42,988 --> 00:48:44,355
Ugh.

438
00:48:53,031 --> 00:48:54,665
Who wants a job?

439
00:49:00,205 --> 00:49:02,940
Sorry.

440
00:49:21,993 --> 00:49:23,028
Go, go, go, go.

441
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,365
Well, well, well.

442
00:49:30,035 --> 00:49:31,869
Come on!

443
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:37,474
You see?
Fuck off subtlety

444
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:42,647
and the universe will
open itself up to you.

445
00:49:48,386 --> 00:49:49,954
Fuck's sake.

446
00:49:56,361 --> 00:49:57,428
Thank you.

447
00:50:10,475 --> 00:50:12,277
Aaaahhh!

448
00:50:36,301 --> 00:50:38,402
Shit! Fucking bullets.

449
00:50:38,403 --> 00:50:40,037
Fucking thing.

450
00:51:31,689 --> 00:51:33,157
Grenade?

451
00:51:33,158 --> 00:51:36,926
Way too loud.
It'll blow the phones.

452
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,128
I have smoke.

453
00:51:38,129 --> 00:51:40,597
Of course, you have.

454
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:42,467
One bullet left.

455
00:51:47,205 --> 00:51:49,439
You stay here.

456
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,342
You, with me.

457
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:19,829
- Fuck.
- Hah!

458
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:23,099
I told you!

459
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,635
What'd I tell you?
Don't fuck with me.

460
00:53:25,636 --> 00:53:27,170
- Just doing anything.
- Egh!

461
00:53:27,171 --> 00:53:28,972
Aah!

462
00:53:28,973 --> 00:53:30,541
What the fuck!

463
00:53:33,844 --> 00:53:35,512
Yeah, scream.

464
00:53:35,513 --> 00:53:37,514
Pretty little thing, ain't you?

465
00:53:37,515 --> 00:53:39,015
Show me your teeth.

466
00:53:39,016 --> 00:53:40,485
Hold still.

467
00:53:41,652 --> 00:53:42,786
Scott!

468
00:53:42,787 --> 00:53:45,154
They said they wanted you alive,

469
00:53:45,155 --> 00:53:48,092
but they didn't say nothing
about your teeth.

470
00:53:55,500 --> 00:54:01,004
Eeeny... meeny... miny... moe.

471
00:54:01,005 --> 00:54:02,307
Aaaaghh!

472
00:54:05,676 --> 00:54:09,447
- Fucker.
- Aaah.

473
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:27,532
Walker.

474
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:33,470
He's not breathing.

475
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:35,405
Scott? No.

476
00:54:35,406 --> 00:54:38,107
- Scott?
- Come on, you big lug.

477
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,576
Fight.

478
00:54:39,577 --> 00:54:41,345
You can't let this beat you!

479
00:54:41,346 --> 00:54:45,014
Fight!

480
00:54:45,015 --> 00:54:46,484
Fight!

481
00:54:51,356 --> 00:54:52,823
Daddy...

482
00:54:58,363 --> 00:55:01,765
Are you two okay?

483
00:55:01,766 --> 00:55:05,370
Never better.

484
00:55:06,937 --> 00:55:10,174
Slow down, cowboy.
You need to take it easy.

485
00:55:11,542 --> 00:55:15,813
No time.

486
00:55:21,986 --> 00:55:24,221
Thank you.

487
00:55:32,497 --> 00:55:33,630
Speak.

488
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:36,332
The compound's been sieged.

489
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:39,436
I need two cars now.

490
00:55:39,437 --> 00:55:41,138
One hour.

491
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:47,777
We need to lay low for one hour.

492
00:55:47,778 --> 00:55:48,979
An hour?

493
00:55:50,981 --> 00:55:52,281
We can lay low for an hour.

494
00:55:52,282 --> 00:55:53,683
I wonder if this place
has got some whisky.

495
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:55,151
We need to find
somewhere to hide.

496
00:55:55,152 --> 00:55:56,319
We need our documents.

497
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,655
What?

498
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:06,830
It's back in the other building.

499
00:56:06,831 --> 00:56:08,998
Why didn't we think
about this before?

500
00:56:08,999 --> 00:56:11,134
They may not even be made.

501
00:56:11,135 --> 00:56:14,539
We have to try.
She has to disappear today.

502
00:56:16,541 --> 00:56:17,875
Let's go.

503
00:56:24,482 --> 00:56:26,050
Can't hide forever.

504
00:56:29,554 --> 00:56:31,321
You okay?

505
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:34,824
I hope so.

506
00:56:34,825 --> 00:56:36,293
Come on!

507
00:56:41,999 --> 00:56:44,000
You hide behind there.

508
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:45,569
What you gonna do?

509
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:47,937
- Come on.
- I'll grab his attention.

510
00:56:47,938 --> 00:56:51,007
When he come, you go.

511
00:56:51,008 --> 00:56:52,842
You're injured.
Have you seen that guy?

512
00:56:52,843 --> 00:56:54,178
I'll be fine.

513
00:56:56,547 --> 00:56:57,882
I'll see you.

514
00:57:07,492 --> 00:57:08,993
Gotcha.

515
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:37,855
I know you're in here...

516
00:57:43,694 --> 00:57:48,699
And I know you're protecting
that pretty little thing.

517
00:57:54,204 --> 00:57:58,676
Have no doubt, I'm gonna
break your fucking neck.

518
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:01,811
And not because of the money
they've offered me.

519
00:58:01,812 --> 00:58:03,980
No. It's more than that.

520
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:05,349
I remember you.

521
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:09,286
I've been waiting for this.

522
00:58:09,287 --> 00:58:11,155
Aaaahh!

523
00:58:25,369 --> 00:58:27,336
As long as you live,

524
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,373
there'll always be
something waiting.

525
00:58:44,922 --> 00:58:46,023
Painful.

526
00:58:54,298 --> 00:58:55,800
Fuck.

527
00:58:57,101 --> 00:58:59,336
Go find the documents.

528
00:59:02,172 --> 00:59:03,273
And hide.

529
00:59:23,828 --> 00:59:25,729
Painful.

530
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:27,164
Hell yeah.

531
00:59:43,013 --> 00:59:44,214
Run!

532
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:51,355
Hah!

533
01:00:22,887 --> 01:00:25,022
You're gonna love this.

534
01:00:54,451 --> 01:00:56,553
Fuck.

535
01:01:19,043 --> 01:01:21,344
Much better.

536
01:01:21,345 --> 01:01:22,813
Now, my dear,

537
01:01:24,882 --> 01:01:27,650
I know it sounds cliché

538
01:01:27,651 --> 01:01:29,753
but there really is

539
01:01:29,754 --> 01:01:32,890
a hard way or an easy way.

540
01:01:50,107 --> 01:01:51,375
Right.

541
01:01:54,979 --> 01:01:56,146
Suit yourself.

542
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:05,321
Now before I dispatch you,

543
01:02:05,322 --> 01:02:07,656
make yourself useful.

544
01:02:07,657 --> 01:02:10,027
The girl, where is she?

545
01:02:16,967 --> 01:02:19,036
The old double back, ey?

546
01:03:19,529 --> 01:03:21,531
Come out, come out
wherever you are.

547
01:03:25,169 --> 01:03:27,470
Oh, sweet Juliet.

548
01:03:27,471 --> 01:03:30,440
I won't hurt you. Promise.

549
01:03:48,258 --> 01:03:50,994
It seems
you're wounded, little one.

550
01:03:50,995 --> 01:03:53,030
Wouldn't want to hurt
the baby now, would you?

551
01:04:21,959 --> 01:04:23,693
Wherefore art thou?

552
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:46,483
All right, princess.
Playtime's over.

553
01:05:02,099 --> 01:05:04,101
Aaahh!

554
01:05:38,868 --> 01:05:41,005
You know,
he might even let you go

555
01:05:42,106 --> 01:05:44,441
once he's ripped that creature
out of you.

556
01:06:23,547 --> 01:06:26,283
She's my baby.

557
01:06:48,138 --> 01:06:49,839
Now, you choose.

558
01:06:52,709 --> 01:06:55,445
The easy way or the hard way?

559
01:06:56,613 --> 01:06:59,015
I... I choose...

560
01:07:08,992 --> 01:07:10,427
I chose for you.

561
01:07:38,755 --> 01:07:40,657
I'm sure they won't mind
a few scratches.

562
01:08:12,689 --> 01:08:15,024
The innocent suffers.

563
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:36,045
You were doing this for me.

564
01:08:39,816 --> 01:08:44,354
Smithee. I guess
I've been here enough.

565
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:02,939
You didn't deserve this.

566
01:09:05,275 --> 01:09:06,510
None of you.

567
01:09:12,216 --> 01:09:14,583
You found them.

568
01:09:14,584 --> 01:09:19,155
Only mine.
I guess she only found yours.

569
01:09:20,290 --> 01:09:21,625
We have to find her.

570
01:09:23,527 --> 01:09:24,594
What you doing?

571
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:34,838
Ah, I see.

572
01:09:37,307 --> 01:09:38,275
There I was thinking...

573
01:09:38,276 --> 01:09:41,310
There will be a car
for you outside.

574
01:09:41,311 --> 01:09:42,779
After everything...

575
01:09:46,283 --> 01:09:48,184
No attachment.

576
01:09:49,353 --> 01:09:50,853
Number one rule.

577
01:09:50,854 --> 01:09:51,987
I know about your past.

578
01:09:51,988 --> 01:09:53,055
You know nothing!

579
01:09:53,056 --> 01:09:54,791
I know what happened.

580
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:03,165
Your little girl's mother,
killed in a revenge shooting

581
01:10:03,166 --> 01:10:06,370
because you got those hostages
out of Yemen.

582
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:08,737
You were trying to do
the right thing

583
01:10:08,738 --> 01:10:11,173
and you were punished.

584
01:10:11,174 --> 01:10:12,341
But there comes a time...

585
01:10:12,342 --> 01:10:13,676
Time for what?

586
01:10:13,677 --> 01:10:15,844
My little girl
will never be safe

587
01:10:15,845 --> 01:10:18,947
if I'm not dead to her.

588
01:10:18,948 --> 01:10:21,650
That's how we survive.

589
01:10:21,651 --> 01:10:23,487
No attachment.

590
01:10:26,956 --> 01:10:29,926
You will find out one day.

591
01:10:32,696 --> 01:10:34,831
Go fuck yourself.

592
01:10:41,305 --> 01:10:43,039
Urgh!

593
01:12:05,221 --> 01:12:06,956
No, no, no.

594
01:12:34,117 --> 01:12:35,118
Ugh!

595
01:12:42,426 --> 01:12:43,927
One bullet left.

596
01:12:45,962 --> 01:12:47,697
Story of my life.

597
01:12:58,341 --> 01:12:59,543
About bloody time.

598
01:13:00,677 --> 01:13:03,345
And why is she bleeding?

599
01:13:03,346 --> 01:13:05,781
She better not be hurt, Keates,

600
01:13:05,782 --> 01:13:07,150
or it's both our heads.

601
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:11,019
Oh, thank you, Keates,
for saving the day

602
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:13,723
when all the pathetic boys
went and got themselves killed.

603
01:13:15,625 --> 01:13:17,260
They couldn't pick up
a girl in a bar.

604
01:13:19,328 --> 01:13:20,329
Come on.

605
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,333
Open up.

606
01:13:25,334 --> 01:13:26,935
Argh!

607
01:13:26,936 --> 01:13:28,605
Fucking morons.

608
01:13:33,109 --> 01:13:34,377
Careful.

609
01:14:03,306 --> 01:14:05,240
Not bad.

610
01:14:05,241 --> 01:14:06,776
You're gonna watch this.

611
01:14:15,885 --> 01:14:17,386
Fucking hell.

612
01:14:41,611 --> 01:14:42,612
Aagh!

613
01:15:49,478 --> 01:15:51,314
You need to stay down.

614
01:16:08,497 --> 01:16:10,398
Eeeeegghhh!

615
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:12,268
Not today, sweetheart.

616
01:16:17,473 --> 01:16:18,774
Fuck!

617
01:16:18,775 --> 01:16:20,677
I'll take you both on
one-handed...

618
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:41,364
Mm.

619
01:16:42,832 --> 01:16:45,233
Are you both okay?

620
01:16:45,234 --> 01:16:47,103
I hope so.

621
01:16:58,047 --> 01:17:00,049
He won't stop
looking for us, will he?

622
01:17:05,889 --> 01:17:07,891
You need to get out of here.

623
01:17:09,358 --> 01:17:10,326
I couldn't find your paperwork.

624
01:17:10,327 --> 01:17:12,828
I'm really sorry.

625
01:17:12,829 --> 01:17:14,530
Our friend had them.

626
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:20,103
I'll be back in two minutes.

627
01:17:59,342 --> 01:18:01,477
You need this more than I do.

628
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:05,548
Thank you.

629
01:19:00,603 --> 01:19:03,171
Get yourself cleaned up.

630
01:19:03,172 --> 01:19:05,775
I have a job for you.

631
01:19:10,346 --> 01:19:12,782
There's something else I have to
do first.

632
01:19:50,186 --> 01:19:51,419
Oops.

633
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:52,654
What?

634
01:19:52,655 --> 01:19:55,224
Quick. She's kicking.

635
01:20:00,830 --> 01:20:02,698
Even she doesn't want you to go.

636
01:20:06,602 --> 01:20:08,471
It's not over for me.

637
01:20:10,439 --> 01:20:12,175
But it can be.

638
01:20:18,848 --> 01:20:22,986
There are girls out
there like you and that's on me.

639
01:20:24,553 --> 01:20:27,156
If they're still alive,
I have to try.

640
01:20:35,364 --> 01:20:36,699
Will you visit?

641
01:20:39,702 --> 01:20:41,037
Maybe.

642
01:20:54,884 --> 01:20:56,351
I'll break down every door,

643
01:20:56,352 --> 01:20:58,586
I'll smash in every skull
until she's recovered.

644
01:20:58,587 --> 01:21:01,490
For that, you have
my fucking word!

645
01:21:09,765 --> 01:21:10,899
The guests are all here.

646
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:12,234
Stop hiding.

647
01:21:12,235 --> 01:21:15,971
I'm not hiding.
I'll be down in a minute...

648
01:21:15,972 --> 01:21:18,374
I have a business to run.

649
01:21:28,851 --> 01:21:29,985
You'll be sorry you tried this,

650
01:21:29,986 --> 01:21:31,120
you chicken shit!

651
01:21:32,488 --> 01:21:33,488
Who you working for?

652
01:21:33,489 --> 01:21:35,890
I hired, fired, and murdered
ten of your kind

653
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:36,926
before breakfast!

654
01:22:14,163 --> 01:22:15,264
Do you mind?

655
01:22:34,050 --> 01:22:36,885
Cuban, very nice.

656
01:22:41,057 --> 01:22:42,225
Who sent you?

657
01:22:44,193 --> 01:22:46,162
Who you working for?

658
01:22:55,338 --> 01:22:56,972
Big mistake.

659
01:22:58,374 --> 01:22:59,942
Getting attached.

660
01:23:04,613 --> 01:23:06,581
I thought you knew better.

661
01:23:06,582 --> 01:23:11,686
And what are you doing here
then?

662
01:23:11,687 --> 01:23:14,622
She can't be paying you.

663
01:23:14,623 --> 01:23:17,259
You think you're special.

664
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:22,997
You think you're righteous.
You're no different from me.

665
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:26,168
You're no different
from the rest of us.

666
01:23:26,169 --> 01:23:29,104
What you doing here

667
01:23:29,105 --> 01:23:35,678
if not for some
disillusioned attachment?

668
01:23:36,979 --> 01:23:38,614
We're the same.

669
01:23:46,122 --> 01:23:48,224
No. We're not.

670
01:23:49,525 --> 01:23:51,826
You're scumbag.

671
01:23:51,827 --> 01:23:52,994
I'm making sure
she doesn't have to

672
01:23:52,995 --> 01:23:55,030
look over her shoulder again.

673
01:23:58,301 --> 01:23:59,702
Who are you?

674
01:24:05,108 --> 01:24:06,109
I'm nobody.
