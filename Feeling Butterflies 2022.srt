5
00:00:45,867 --> 00:00:46,800
Hi!

6
00:00:46,934 --> 00:00:47,900
Man on phone:
You need to hurry!

7
00:00:48,033 --> 00:00:49,567
The wedding's already started.

8
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,266
Yes, I'm here now.
Just keep them entertained.

9
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,500
I'll be there in a jiff.
Okay, bye.

10
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,567
No, no, no! Not again!

11
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,467
Ugh! Okay.

12
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,667
Here's the deal.
You can break down tomorrow,

13
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,500
I'm free all day,
but I can't do this right now.

14
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:06,967
Got it?

15
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,100
Oh, I owe you one!

16
00:01:33,834 --> 00:01:35,867
Come on, little guy.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,333
I know it doesn't seem like it,
but if you come with me,

18
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:41,633
you will be free to fly away,

19
00:01:41,767 --> 00:01:43,633
migrate and help pollinate
the world.

20
00:01:43,767 --> 00:01:45,800
What do you say?

21
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:57,333
Where is she?

22
00:01:57,467 --> 00:01:59,066
Come on.

23
00:02:00,734 --> 00:02:02,667
Come on! Oh! Hey.

24
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,100
They're about to say their vows.

25
00:02:09,233 --> 00:02:10,467
I know, I know, trust me,

26
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,567
everything that could go wrong
today has gone wrong.

27
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,066
Well, this one can't.

28
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,800
They've only paid us half
so far.

29
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,100
Pastor: Having witnessed
their pledge of fidelity

30
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,400
to one another...

31
00:02:31,533 --> 00:02:34,567
To love, honour,
and cherish one another

32
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,300
in the presence of this gathering.

33
00:02:36,433 --> 00:02:38,900
And by the power vested in me,

34
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:43,700
it is my honour to now pronounce
you husband and wife.

35
00:02:43,834 --> 00:02:46,433
Now you may kiss the bride.

36
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:48,967
Crowd:
Aww.

37
00:03:18,266 --> 00:03:19,467
You okay?

38
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,500
Yeah, I'm just happy for her.

39
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:25,433
And happy that we pulled
this off.

40
00:03:26,934 --> 00:03:30,433
I'm your best friend, Emily.
I know it still hurts.

41
00:03:32,467 --> 00:03:34,467
I'm over it.

42
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,100
It's not something you just
get over.

43
00:03:37,233 --> 00:03:39,000
Well, you're the one who keeps
bringing it up

44
00:03:39,133 --> 00:03:40,700
every time we do a wedding.

45
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:43,800
And I told you I can handle the
weddings on my own.

46
00:03:43,934 --> 00:03:45,600
Come on.

47
00:03:45,734 --> 00:03:48,834
Let's go get ready for
tomorrow's birthday party.

48
00:03:58,934 --> 00:04:02,100
Does anyone know what kind of
butterfly this is?

49
00:04:02,233 --> 00:04:03,867
How about the birthday girl?

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,667
A blue butterfly!

51
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,834
Emily:
That's true, it is blue.

52
00:04:07,967 --> 00:04:11,033
And close, it's called an
Eastern Tailed Blue.

53
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,567
He just emerged yesterday.

54
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,066
How do you know if it's a boy?

55
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,767
See the black spots on the top
of his wings?

56
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,066
The females don't have them.

57
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,867
Amanda:
What's he doing?

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,734
It takes a few hours for his
wings to dry

59
00:04:23,867 --> 00:04:25,867
and harden enough for
him to fly.

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,867
Is he going to fly away?

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,200
Mm-hm. Pretty soon.

62
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,934
This is all very new to him.

63
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:35,867
Does anyone know what we
butterflies eat?

64
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,600
Man:
Fruit slices.

65
00:04:38,734 --> 00:04:40,533
Or sugar water.

66
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:45,400
Yes, very good.

67
00:04:45,533 --> 00:04:48,400
Daddy, she was asking us.

68
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:53,033
Sorry.

69
00:04:56,834 --> 00:04:58,266
Don't worry, he won't hurt you.

70
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,467
It tickles.

71
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,667
That's because he knows you're
just sweet as sugar water.

72
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,200
Where is he going?

73
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,767
He's off to do his part
in the world.

74
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:15,633
I have some more Eastern Tailed
Blues over here.

75
00:05:15,767 --> 00:05:17,166
Come see.

76
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,800
That weasel.

77
00:05:28,934 --> 00:05:30,300
My neighbour?

78
00:05:30,433 --> 00:05:33,233
No, Mandy Fischer.

79
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:35,166
I booked that party too

80
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,066
and she swooped in
and undercut me again.

81
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,300
Garrett: Oh, yeah,
I think got a flier from her.

82
00:05:40,433 --> 00:05:41,900
And she was cheaper.

83
00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:44,000
Well, there's reason for that.

84
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,000
Oh, Mandy!

85
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:56,100
Mandy:
Emily! Nice party.

86
00:05:56,233 --> 00:05:58,967
A whopping one butterfly
you released there, huh?

87
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,066
Hmm, yeah, we like to teach our
party guests a thing or two

88
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,300
about butterflies
before we set them free.

89
00:06:04,433 --> 00:06:07,166
Yawn. They must love that.

90
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,400
Passing off any moths as
monarchs today?

91
00:06:10,533 --> 00:06:11,967
Whatever.

92
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,200
Time for me to run.
Gotta release a few more.

93
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,834
Several more.

94
00:06:16,967 --> 00:06:19,500
More, as in, more than you.

95
00:06:29,633 --> 00:06:32,000
Hey, I-- I only paid for 25.

96
00:06:32,133 --> 00:06:35,233
Oh, this is on the house.
I won't be out-butterflied.

97
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:46,734
Hey, kids!
Come over here now!

98
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,066
Kids:
Wow! Whoa!

99
00:06:55,467 --> 00:06:57,633
Girl: So many!
Look at the big one!

100
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,266
And more!

101
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,300
Are you kidding me?

102
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:14,066
Oh, come on, little guys.

103
00:07:21,433 --> 00:07:23,266
Girl:
they're so colourful!

104
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,033
Who wants to see more?

105
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,700
How'd it go?

106
00:08:04,834 --> 00:08:07,633
Great, five dozen new Blue
Swallow Tails

107
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:10,100
are out making the world a
better place.

108
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:11,633
I thought we only had two dozen
for this party.

109
00:08:11,767 --> 00:08:13,266
Yeah, there was an incident.

110
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,767
What kind of incident?

111
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,166
A Mandy Fischer kind of incident.

112
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,700
Emily!
I know! I know!

113
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm sorry.
I couldn't help myself.

114
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:24,333
She's just so smug.

115
00:08:24,467 --> 00:08:26,100
And I think she shorts people
on butterflies.

116
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:27,767
That goes against the code.

117
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,000
"The code?"

118
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,467
Okay, we had a bumper crop anyway.

119
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,700
That's beside the point.

120
00:08:31,834 --> 00:08:34,834
Half of her butterflies
were probably fake.

121
00:08:34,967 --> 00:08:36,100
Garrett:
Emily?

122
00:08:36,233 --> 00:08:38,033
Oh.

123
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,767
Uh, sorry, before you leave,
Amanda wanted to say bye.

124
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,467
Oh, yeah, I'll be right there.

125
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,867
Is that the dad?

126
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,967
Yes, it's the dad.

127
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:55,700
What?

128
00:08:57,133 --> 00:08:58,533
Stop it.

129
00:09:02,533 --> 00:09:04,667
Anytime. Seriously.

130
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,734
I look forward to your call.

131
00:09:06,867 --> 00:09:08,166
Anytime.

132
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,633
Toodles.

133
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,767
Oh, uh, you--
you left this behind.

134
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,834
Emily: Oh, actually, here.
Take one.

135
00:09:21,967 --> 00:09:24,100
Put it up at your office
or something.

136
00:09:24,233 --> 00:09:25,700
Free advertising.

137
00:09:25,834 --> 00:09:27,867
Look, I just want to thank you.

138
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,200
You know, for the extra butterflies.

139
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:31,533
Kids had a great time.

140
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:34,066
Sorry if it got weird.

141
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,834
Weird? What's weird about
two dueling butterfly parties?

142
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:39,567
I think your friend Mandy got a
kick out of it too.

143
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,433
Friend...

144
00:09:41,567 --> 00:09:44,033
Between you and me,
that educational bit,

145
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,600
it was a nice touch.

146
00:09:45,734 --> 00:09:47,734
The kids, they weren't
bored at all.

147
00:09:47,867 --> 00:09:49,066
Thank you.

148
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,767
Amanda? Come over here.

149
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,533
The nice lady is leaving.

150
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:58,066
Great, I'm the "nice lady."

151
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,533
Aww.

152
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:03,767
Thank you so much, this was the
best birthday party ever.

153
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,767
Oh, I'm so glad! I hope the rest
of it is just as fun.

154
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,934
Thanks, Emily. Bye!

155
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,300
Bye!

156
00:10:11,734 --> 00:10:13,433
It was a pleasure meeting you.

157
00:10:13,567 --> 00:10:15,300
Yeah, you too.

158
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:19,967
Oh, uh, sorry.

159
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,533
Hey, Jill.
I'm so glad you called.

160
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:25,567
Yeah, I'm just with Amanda
right now.

161
00:10:38,967 --> 00:10:40,433
Jill could be anybody.

162
00:10:40,567 --> 00:10:42,767
Like who?
His mother.

163
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,767
Who calls their mother
by her first name?

164
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,500
His sister, a business colleague.

165
00:10:47,633 --> 00:10:49,033
Nah, not the way he answered it.

166
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,100
Mandy I can handle.

167
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,300
Jill is the unknown.

168
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:56,767
But it doesn't matter because he
probably thinks I'm crazy anyway

169
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,633
after my showdown at the
butterfly corral.

170
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:03,200
No, he thought that was funny.
I thought that was crazy.

171
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:06,400
Is that from today?

172
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:07,667
Mm-hm.

173
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,066
And how did you get it?

174
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,100
When you went to say goodbye to
your hot single dad,

175
00:11:11,233 --> 00:11:12,867
one of the parents was about to
throw it away.

176
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,567
I rescued it.

177
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,533
Mm-hm. You rescued it?

178
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:18,667
Yeah, how about you rescue
a salad later?

179
00:11:20,533 --> 00:11:21,934
Mmm.

180
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:27,834
Okay, fine. And I was not going
over to say goodbye to him.

181
00:11:27,967 --> 00:11:30,000
I was invited over
to say goodbye to his daughter.

182
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:33,066
Mm-hm, by him.

183
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,166
We're not supposed to flirt with
clients anyway,

184
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,667
it's bad etiquette.

185
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,900
The point is,
this is the first time in a year

186
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:40,667
you've even shown so much
as a pulse

187
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,100
in the presence of another guy.
That is progress.

188
00:11:44,233 --> 00:11:46,900
Well, he is cute.

189
00:11:47,033 --> 00:11:49,233
And he's nice.

190
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:51,433
And unavailable.

191
00:11:53,633 --> 00:11:55,200
Sweetheart?

192
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:56,533
Hey!
You know,

193
00:11:56,667 --> 00:11:57,767
the doorbell
does work.

194
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,266
Nonsense. Adam!

195
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,633
How are you doing?

196
00:12:01,767 --> 00:12:02,900
Just fine, Larry.

197
00:12:03,033 --> 00:12:05,033
Well, I thought we'd bake.

198
00:12:09,066 --> 00:12:12,166
You know, to help you get your
mind off things.

199
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,433
Dad, it's been a year.

200
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,467
I don't need to keep taking
my mind off things.

201
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,934
Nonsense. A father knows.

202
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,066
Oh, did you happen to call
that young man

203
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,266
I met at the gas station
the other day?

204
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,166
You mean the perfect stranger
who probably thought

205
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,567
you were insane?

206
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,667
He gave me his number!
He was interested.

207
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,800
You made it sound like I was
desperate for a date.

208
00:12:35,934 --> 00:12:37,433
You are.
Dad!

209
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:42,100
Aww, poor kid.

210
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:44,300
I'm just trying to look out
for you.

211
00:12:44,433 --> 00:12:47,967
Okay, can we do this tomorrow?
It's been a long day.

212
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,000
You raise butterflies.
How hard can that be?

213
00:12:54,033 --> 00:12:56,300
Um, incredibly hard, actually.

214
00:12:56,433 --> 00:12:58,400
Catch you later. Bye, Larry.

215
00:12:58,533 --> 00:13:00,533
Oh, you're leaving?

216
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:02,066
Oh, I have a date.

217
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:05,200
See?

218
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,667
I thought that was canceled.

219
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,500
See ya.

220
00:13:08,633 --> 00:13:10,233
Just gonna rescue this.

221
00:13:11,367 --> 00:13:14,967
Well, looks like it's just us.

222
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,633
Just us.

223
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:19,233
Okay, what are we baking, Dad?

224
00:13:19,367 --> 00:13:22,900
I am thinking a lemon loaf.

225
00:13:23,033 --> 00:13:24,233
Lemon loaf?
Yeah.

226
00:13:24,367 --> 00:13:25,500
That's new.

227
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,834
Hey.

228
00:13:30,967 --> 00:13:32,734
Morning. Did they arrive?

229
00:13:32,867 --> 00:13:34,567
Yep, fresh off the farm.

230
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,500
You sure there's 200 in there?

231
00:13:36,633 --> 00:13:37,800
Emily:
Well, there better be.

232
00:13:37,934 --> 00:13:40,667
The Stromwall retirement party
is in four weeks.

233
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,567
Barely enough time.

234
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,066
I know you mentioned
there's a code and everything,

235
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,700
but is anyone really
going to count?

236
00:13:47,834 --> 00:13:50,233
They asked for 200 butterflies,
they're paying

237
00:13:50,367 --> 00:13:52,367
for 200 butterflies,
we will deliver them--

238
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,233
200 butterflies. I know.

239
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:58,133
But this is going to be the
biggest release we've ever made.

240
00:13:58,266 --> 00:13:59,467
We might need help.

241
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,266
I know.

242
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,200
And a new compressor.

243
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:07,467
Or we won't have any butterflies
to deliver.

244
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:11,734
Oh. It's them.

245
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:13,300
Them?

246
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,533
Hi!
Hi!

247
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:19,767
You're sure we're not intruding?

248
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,066
Oh, no, not at all.
Hi, Amanda.

249
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,367
Hi!

250
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,900
You made quite the impression on
this one.

251
00:14:25,033 --> 00:14:26,133
She's about to start a--

252
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:27,900
I want to tell her, Daddy!

253
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,567
Sorry.

254
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,533
So I've been really interested
in butterflies since my party.

255
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:34,266
Her school is doing a project
on butter--

256
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,533
Daddy!
Sorry.

257
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,934
So that's why I want to get a
tour of a butterfly farm.

258
00:14:39,066 --> 00:14:42,600
Oh, well, you came to
the right spot.

259
00:14:42,734 --> 00:14:46,767
Oh, um, this is Adam, you met
him at the party.

260
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,433
Hi.
Garrett.

261
00:14:48,567 --> 00:14:49,867
I remember.

262
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,967
Amanda is interested
in what we do.

263
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,500
Come on in,
I'll show you guys around.

264
00:14:58,266 --> 00:15:01,166
So this is where we keep all
the eggs and larva.

265
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,166
It has to stay very clean

266
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,667
and the temperature
has to be regulated

267
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,300
so there's just the right warmth
and humidity.

268
00:15:07,433 --> 00:15:09,033
This is so cool.

269
00:15:11,767 --> 00:15:13,266
Come with me.

270
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,533
First things first,
very important,

271
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,967
we need to clean our hands.

272
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,800
And then we go into what we call
the Flight House.

273
00:15:22,934 --> 00:15:24,033
That's where we keep--

274
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,300
All the butterflies.

275
00:15:25,433 --> 00:15:27,200
That's right.

276
00:15:32,233 --> 00:15:34,967
So this is what we like to call
our butterfly sanctuary

277
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,533
instead of a farm.

278
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:39,600
We raise a lot of butterflies
just to set them free.

279
00:15:39,734 --> 00:15:41,500
Like a butterfly rescue.

280
00:15:41,633 --> 00:15:43,533
In a way, yes.

281
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:46,333
Did you know Monarchs can fly
all the way to Mexico?

282
00:15:46,467 --> 00:15:48,266
I did know that.

283
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,033
And that some flowers wouldn't
survive

284
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,667
if butterflies didn't pollenate
them?

285
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,467
Emily:
That's right.

286
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,667
And that growing milkweed and
other plants is really good

287
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,200
because a lot of their habitat
is being destroyed.

288
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,200
Wow, you have done your
homework!

289
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,367
Oh, you have no idea.

290
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,166
Well, then you can see that this
isn't just a business.

291
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,734
We're also helping the planet, too.

292
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:10,600
And they're really pretty.

293
00:16:10,734 --> 00:16:12,166
They are really pretty,
aren't they?

294
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,266
You're really pretty.

295
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,533
My dad thinks so.

296
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:17,567
I heard him talking to his
friend on the phone.

297
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,400
Garrett:
Uh, Amanda.

298
00:16:19,533 --> 00:16:21,266
I, uh, I don't know what she
thought she heard...

299
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,000
on the phone.

300
00:16:23,133 --> 00:16:25,066
You don't think she's pretty,
Daddy?

301
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,367
Yes, I do.

302
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,767
Told you.

303
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,400
Thank you.

304
00:16:30,533 --> 00:16:32,500
Emily, a word?

305
00:16:32,633 --> 00:16:34,000
Yeah.

306
00:16:36,633 --> 00:16:37,734
Bingo.

307
00:16:37,867 --> 00:16:40,233
Oh, stop it!
It doesn't mean anything.

308
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:42,900
You're worse than the kid.

309
00:16:43,033 --> 00:16:46,400
So this, obviously,
is where the butterfly emerges

310
00:16:46,533 --> 00:16:48,066
from the chrysalis.

311
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,900
Different suppliers send us
our eggs and larva,

312
00:16:50,033 --> 00:16:51,500
as you saw in the lab.

313
00:16:51,633 --> 00:16:52,867
How long does it take
for a larva

314
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,233
to turn into a caterpillar?

315
00:16:54,367 --> 00:16:55,834
Well, that depends on the weather.

316
00:16:55,967 --> 00:16:59,200
But from egg to butterfly,
usually about four weeks.

317
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,767
Yeah, three to five days
for the egg to turn to larva.

318
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,433
Which grow into caterpillars.

319
00:17:03,567 --> 00:17:06,767
That's right.
And about ten days

320
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,767
for the caterpillar
to turn into a chrysalis.

321
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,000
And about two weeks after that,
a butterfly comes out.

322
00:17:12,133 --> 00:17:14,066
Very good!

323
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,800
I always used to just take that
stuff for granted,

324
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:18,667
but it's pretty amazing.

325
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,166
I like to think so, too.

326
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,934
I have an idea.

327
00:17:22,066 --> 00:17:24,633
How would the two of you like to
help out at our next event?

328
00:17:24,767 --> 00:17:26,900
Sure! Can we, Daddy?

329
00:17:27,033 --> 00:17:29,100
If it's okay with you.

330
00:17:29,233 --> 00:17:31,600
Yeah. Great idea.

331
00:17:31,734 --> 00:17:33,000
Amanda: Awesome!

332
00:17:33,133 --> 00:17:34,900
Oh!

333
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:36,400
Excuse me.

334
00:17:37,867 --> 00:17:39,934
Hello, this is Emily.

335
00:17:40,066 --> 00:17:43,033
Oh please, like Rebecca O'Keefe
would be calling me.

336
00:17:44,133 --> 00:17:45,967
Wait, this is really Rebecca
O'Keefe?

337
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,934
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.

338
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:50,767
You'd like to meet?! When?

339
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,633
Sure! Wait.

340
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:54,166
Wait, how many?

341
00:17:55,767 --> 00:17:57,567
Okay. I'll see you then.

342
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,233
That was Rebecca O'Keefe.

343
00:18:03,367 --> 00:18:05,333
Rebecca O'Keefe as in the
socialite heiress

344
00:18:05,467 --> 00:18:07,133
to the O'Keefe publishing
empire?

345
00:18:07,266 --> 00:18:08,700
Yep, that Rebecca O'Keefe.

346
00:18:08,834 --> 00:18:10,200
Who is getting married
in a few weeks?

347
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:11,734
It's all over the tabloids.

348
00:18:11,867 --> 00:18:13,033
I guess I missed it.

349
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,333
It's only going to be the most
talked about

350
00:18:14,467 --> 00:18:15,900
wedding of the year.

351
00:18:16,033 --> 00:18:18,800
She wants us to release 500
butterflies at her wedding.

352
00:18:18,934 --> 00:18:20,467
500 butterflies?

353
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,800
500 butterflies.

354
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,734
We're going to raise and release
500 butterflies.

355
00:18:23,867 --> 00:18:25,166
Mm-hm.

356
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,667
When is the
wedding again?
Three weeks.

357
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,233
My gosh.

358
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:39,533
As you can see I don't have a
wedding planner.

359
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:40,834
I don't trust them.

360
00:18:40,967 --> 00:18:42,133
I'll be making all
the decisions

361
00:18:42,266 --> 00:18:43,533
so you'll be dealing
directly with me.

362
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:44,900
Despite what's in the media,

363
00:18:45,033 --> 00:18:46,400
it's going to be an
intimate wedding

364
00:18:46,533 --> 00:18:48,734
with only a few family
and friends.

365
00:18:48,867 --> 00:18:51,000
Great, I just need to know--

366
00:18:51,133 --> 00:18:52,400
Naturally, I'll be wearing white,

367
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:54,700
and all the ladies attending
will be wearing off white.

368
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:56,734
I don't want anyone to hijack
the floral.

369
00:18:56,867 --> 00:18:58,300
I really want the flowers
to pop.

370
00:18:58,433 --> 00:18:59,533
Got it.

371
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:03,367
Is this... too light for my
complexion?

372
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,467
Personally I would go with
a deeper colour.

373
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:12,567
Agreed.
Do the Monarchs come in blue?

374
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,300
No, they're orange
with black and white.

375
00:19:15,433 --> 00:19:20,133
Fine. What's the best compliment
to the color orange?

376
00:19:20,266 --> 00:19:24,300
Well, purple, but then I
wouldn't go as dark.

377
00:19:24,433 --> 00:19:27,700
Lavender is a nice colour,
and lavender smells great.

378
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,533
I'm a conservationist, you know.

379
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:31,233
I heard.

380
00:19:31,367 --> 00:19:32,700
So you can do it?

381
00:19:32,834 --> 00:19:37,567
Yes, 500 butterflies will be a
challenge but we're on it.

382
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,266
I think you misunderstood.
I said at least 500.

383
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,734
Whoever can deliver the most
gets the job.

384
00:19:43,867 --> 00:19:45,633
Whoever?

385
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:49,400
Yeah, it's between you and, um,
what's her name? Fischer?

386
00:19:49,533 --> 00:19:51,467
Mandy Fischer.

387
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,767
I've given her the same opportunity.

388
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,600
She said it would be no
challenge at all.

389
00:19:56,734 --> 00:19:59,867
I'm not surprised.
But honestly,

390
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,266
this many butterflies has never
been done before.

391
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,033
So you can't do it?

392
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:09,700
Nope, I'm the one
who will do it.

393
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:12,467
Great. It will be
well worth your while,

394
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,767
and not just the money,
but the publicity.

395
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,734
Tah.

396
00:20:17,867 --> 00:20:19,233
Tah.

397
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,266
Adam:
Mandy Fischer?!

398
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,600
Doesn't she know she'll short
her by half?

399
00:20:25,734 --> 00:20:27,467
Or use Viceroys instead of
Monarchs?

400
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,934
Rebecca O'Keefe will
never know the difference.

401
00:20:29,066 --> 00:20:30,900
I can't believe you agreed
to this.

402
00:20:31,033 --> 00:20:33,433
How was I supposed to say no?

403
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:36,400
Rebecca O'Keefe is on the cover
of every magazine,

404
00:20:36,533 --> 00:20:40,266
which means this event will be
on the cover of every magazine.

405
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,734
This little business of ours
could hit the big time.

406
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:47,600
It'll hit something else if we
can't deliver 500 butterflies.

407
00:20:47,734 --> 00:20:49,800
At least 500.

408
00:20:49,934 --> 00:20:52,633
I'm not about to let Mandy
Fischer steal this one from me.

409
00:20:52,767 --> 00:20:54,867
Don't make it personal.

410
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,300
I do this because I love butterflies

411
00:20:58,433 --> 00:21:00,333
and how they are connected
to our world.

412
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,800
Mandy's only in it
for the money.

413
00:21:02,934 --> 00:21:06,433
Fair enough. But this is going
to be no easy task.

414
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:08,834
I know. We're going to have to
expand our flight house.

415
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:10,100
And we'll need new suppliers.

416
00:21:10,233 --> 00:21:12,033
And we'll need to buy
caterpillars, not eggs,

417
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:13,700
or there won't be
enough time. Agreed.

418
00:21:13,834 --> 00:21:15,600
I already have calls into
Taylor Brothers

419
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:17,033
and Margallo Farms
in Spokane.

420
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,934
Good. Taylor's a friend of mine,
he'll prioritize for us.

421
00:21:20,066 --> 00:21:21,800
Well, we just need to beat Mandy
to them.

422
00:21:21,934 --> 00:21:23,667
Timing is everything.

423
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,700
The eggs can't hatch a minute
too soon or a minute to late.

424
00:21:26,834 --> 00:21:30,433
And we still have the Stromwall
retirement party coming up.

425
00:21:30,567 --> 00:21:33,867
Oh my gosh, you're right.
Okay, all hands on deck.

426
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,767
Speaking of which,
I'm running late.

427
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,100
Need help with this one?

428
00:21:38,233 --> 00:21:40,834
No, it's small.
Another show and tell.

429
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:44,633
Besides, Garrett and Amanda will
be there. Remember?

430
00:21:44,767 --> 00:21:46,467
Right. How could I forget.

431
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,266
Mm-hm, yeah.
Nice one, by the way.

432
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,533
See ya.

433
00:21:50,667 --> 00:21:53,100
I want to hear every detail.

434
00:21:53,233 --> 00:21:54,934
Mm-hm.

435
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,633
Hi!

436
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:18,467
Sorry, a million things
happening at once today.

437
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,834
That's okay, how can we help?

438
00:22:19,967 --> 00:22:22,900
Uh, well, looks like the
birthday boy's mom

439
00:22:23,033 --> 00:22:24,600
has the decorations set up,

440
00:22:24,734 --> 00:22:26,300
so we just need
the show and tell

441
00:22:26,433 --> 00:22:28,233
and the butterflies.

442
00:22:31,867 --> 00:22:33,066
All right.

443
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,633
You can hold him if you want.

444
00:22:44,767 --> 00:22:47,600
Just let him crawl onto
your hand.

445
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:48,934
It's okay if it flies away.

446
00:22:49,066 --> 00:22:50,667
That's what we want him to do.

447
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,934
Whoa!
Cool!

448
00:23:00,467 --> 00:23:02,567
Kids, parents,
do you want to come over

449
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,300
and look at the show and tell?

450
00:23:13,867 --> 00:23:16,333
Coffee?
You're a godsend.

451
00:23:16,467 --> 00:23:17,800
Thank you.

452
00:23:19,767 --> 00:23:21,133
Hey, Amanda,

453
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:22,700
do you want to take over by
yourself for a little bit?

454
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:23,967
I'm on it.

455
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,533
We're just going to be
over here.

456
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:26,800
Amanda:
Okay.

457
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:37,533
Well, I think she knows more
about butterflies than I do.

458
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:39,400
Yeah, sorry, when she gets
excited about something,

459
00:23:39,533 --> 00:23:41,400
there's no stopping her.

460
00:23:41,533 --> 00:23:45,233
So, uh, how long have you been
doing this butterfly thing?

461
00:23:45,367 --> 00:23:48,667
Four years. Yeah.
It started out as a hobby,

462
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,400
kind of a weekend thing,
and a year later,

463
00:23:51,533 --> 00:23:53,233
I was able to quit my day job.

464
00:23:53,367 --> 00:23:56,567
Mm, and what was that,
if I may ask?

465
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:01,467
You may. Nothing special,
at least it didn't feel special.

466
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,967
Corporate desk job.
Data analyst and miserable.

467
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,233
Oh no, don't tell me you're
a data analyst.

468
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:11,467
Hmm? No.

469
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,066
What do you do for a living,
if I may ask?

470
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,100
You may.

471
00:24:16,233 --> 00:24:20,767
Um, it's a bit weird, but...

472
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,700
nothing, if I don't want to.

473
00:24:23,834 --> 00:24:26,266
What, did you win the lottery
or something?

474
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,967
No. My grandfather did.

475
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,233
He bet right on the stock market.

476
00:24:31,367 --> 00:24:34,200
Now my father runs one of the
largest hedge funds in New York.

477
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:37,433
Wow. So what brought you
out here?

478
00:24:37,567 --> 00:24:40,934
Well, just after Amanda
was born,

479
00:24:41,066 --> 00:24:42,800
her mother passed away.

480
00:24:42,934 --> 00:24:44,266
I'm sorry.

481
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,533
It's okay.

482
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:49,300
Amanda never really knew her, sadly.

483
00:24:49,433 --> 00:24:52,266
And then after a bit of time,
I got into another relationship,

484
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,934
we followed her up here.

485
00:24:54,066 --> 00:24:56,734
Ultimately things didn't
really work out.

486
00:24:56,867 --> 00:24:58,967
So now my father wants me to
come back to New York

487
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,133
and take over the family reigns.

488
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:04,166
Well, you don't sound very
excited about that.

489
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,767
You know, I like working
with my hands.

490
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,000
Working on something tangible.

491
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:09,333
I don't want to work on
a ledger all day,

492
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:10,633
if you know what I mean.

493
00:25:10,767 --> 00:25:13,333
Besides, you have to wear a tie.
I'm not a tie guy.

494
00:25:13,467 --> 00:25:15,000
No?

495
00:25:15,133 --> 00:25:16,500
No.

496
00:25:16,633 --> 00:25:19,266
Well, you do know that there's a
living in fixing things?

497
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,100
Yes, just...

498
00:25:21,233 --> 00:25:24,467
It's just hard to pay for a big
school in New York City.

499
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,166
So you're moving to New York,
then?

500
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,767
Yeah, looks like it.

501
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,467
How soon?

502
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,333
I dunno, a couple weeks, maybe.

503
00:25:33,467 --> 00:25:35,767
It just depends on a few other
things, but...

504
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,700
it's complicated.

505
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,000
So what kinds of things are you
good at fixing?

506
00:25:42,133 --> 00:25:44,467
Oh, well, you name it.

507
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,700
Mechanical?

508
00:25:45,834 --> 00:25:46,967
That's my specialty.

509
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,200
Really?
Yeah.

510
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:52,700
All right, well,
if you're interested,

511
00:25:52,834 --> 00:25:55,166
I might have some work for you
before you go.

512
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,433
Great!

513
00:25:58,834 --> 00:26:00,200
Sorry, I just...

514
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:01,767
Hey, Jill. Yeah.

515
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,233
No, I'm just at a birthday party
with Amanda.

516
00:26:03,367 --> 00:26:04,934
No, not her birthday party.

517
00:26:05,066 --> 00:26:06,400
She had hers last week.
You know that, come on.

518
00:26:06,533 --> 00:26:07,934
Okay, look, why don't we just--

519
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,467
we'll talk about it
when you get here, okay?

520
00:26:11,567 --> 00:26:12,967
Yeah.

521
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,367
So tell me about him.

522
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,600
Tell you about who?

523
00:26:21,734 --> 00:26:24,700
I told you.
A father always knows.

524
00:26:26,734 --> 00:26:28,734
And I can tell that there's
something that has changed

525
00:26:28,867 --> 00:26:30,200
inside of you.

526
00:26:31,667 --> 00:26:33,667
There's a light.

527
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,433
And a bit of melancholy, too.

528
00:26:36,467 --> 00:26:38,667
You are good.
I'll give you that.

529
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,600
Well, you'll have the same
intuition when you have a kid

530
00:26:40,734 --> 00:26:42,433
and I'm a grandfather.

531
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,900
Is that too much to ask?

532
00:26:45,033 --> 00:26:48,533
Dad...
I'm sorry.

533
00:26:48,667 --> 00:26:51,500
I'm sorry if the pain still
sears a bit.

534
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:54,867
It shouldn't.

535
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,200
I love my life, Dad.

536
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:01,800
I have a great business,
great friends.

537
00:27:01,934 --> 00:27:04,400
I don't need a guy
to complete me.

538
00:27:04,533 --> 00:27:06,200
If you say so.

539
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,934
How am I supposed to know
when I'm ready?

540
00:27:10,066 --> 00:27:14,133
Nobody ever knows
if they're ready.

541
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:16,767
So I'm right, aren't I?

542
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,467
You met a guy.

543
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,767
I thought I did.

544
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,133
Tell me about him.

545
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:26,567
It's the first time I've felt
anything since Randy.

546
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,300
That's terrific.

547
00:27:29,433 --> 00:27:32,967
No, not so terrific.
I think he has a girlfriend,

548
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,900
and he might be moving to New
York in a few weeks.

549
00:27:36,033 --> 00:27:37,433
Oh.

550
00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:42,400
Well, at least you're still open
to those kind of feelings.

551
00:27:42,533 --> 00:27:45,967
Well, I don't know how to trust
those feelings, Dad.

552
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,734
I thought I was in love with
Randy, and...

553
00:27:47,867 --> 00:27:50,934
You were in love with Randy.

554
00:27:51,066 --> 00:27:53,233
You were brave.

555
00:27:53,367 --> 00:27:56,166
He's the one who didn't have
the courage to commit.

556
00:27:59,467 --> 00:28:01,300
But I got it wrong. No.

557
00:28:01,433 --> 00:28:04,500
You did not get it wrong.

558
00:28:04,633 --> 00:28:08,233
In life, we try all kinds
of things.

559
00:28:08,367 --> 00:28:11,133
The only time we get it wrong
is when we don't try.

560
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:15,000
So what's his name?

561
00:28:17,533 --> 00:28:19,333
His name is Garrett.

562
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,233
We hosted his daughter's
birthday party.

563
00:28:24,367 --> 00:28:27,333
There's just that... you know.

564
00:28:28,633 --> 00:28:30,633
Chemistry.

565
00:28:30,767 --> 00:28:31,867
Yeah.

566
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,400
Now, are you sure
about the girlfriend thing?

567
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:39,967
Pretty sure.

568
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,000
And lest we forget,
he might be moving.

569
00:28:42,133 --> 00:28:43,834
There's that, too.

570
00:28:43,967 --> 00:28:46,400
Let me tell you something, sweetie.

571
00:28:46,533 --> 00:28:47,700
If it's meant to be,

572
00:28:47,834 --> 00:28:50,133
he's not going anywhere.

573
00:28:51,934 --> 00:28:55,967
Okay, I'll said is that I kind
of like him.

574
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,367
I didn't say anything about it
being meant to be.

575
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,734
Well, listen,
even if he is not Mr. Right,

576
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:05,133
at least you're open to the idea

577
00:29:05,266 --> 00:29:08,100
that Mr. Right is out there somewhere.

578
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,200
That's what worries me.

579
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,934
You are so beautiful, Emily.

580
00:29:15,066 --> 00:29:16,867
Inside and out.

581
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,734
And besides, you can't stay
hidden in your cocoon forever.

582
00:29:26,767 --> 00:29:28,066
My cocoon?

583
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,000
Okay. Give it a try.

584
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,433
Your bearings were burnt out.

585
00:29:40,567 --> 00:29:42,100
That's why it was reading the
wrong temperature.

586
00:29:42,233 --> 00:29:43,400
I don't know how to thank you.

587
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:45,400
Just give me something else
to do.

588
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:48,433
Are you kidding?
We're just getting started.

589
00:29:48,567 --> 00:29:49,800
Um, will these work?

590
00:29:49,934 --> 00:29:51,967
Perfect, come with me.

591
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,233
So, we'll lay them
into each of these habitats,

592
00:29:54,367 --> 00:29:56,133
and we'll lean them against
the sides.

593
00:29:56,266 --> 00:29:58,100
We just want someplace for
the butterflies to perch

594
00:29:58,233 --> 00:29:59,600
once they emerge.
Got it.

595
00:29:59,734 --> 00:30:01,800
But we can do that after,
we'd better get going.

596
00:30:01,934 --> 00:30:04,066
Mm-hm.
Where are we going?

597
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,433
To the woods!

598
00:30:05,567 --> 00:30:06,867
What's in the woods?

599
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,567
Milkweed for the Monarchs.
Cheaper than buying it.

600
00:30:19,066 --> 00:30:20,900
at the stem. thp

601
00:30:21,033 --> 00:30:23,834
Keep the leaves whole,
Monarchs eat a lot.

602
00:30:30,533 --> 00:30:32,934
Uh...
It's my Dad.

603
00:30:33,066 --> 00:30:35,000
He's just excited about us
coming back?

604
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:37,233
Well, can you tell him that
you'll still be around

605
00:30:37,367 --> 00:30:38,467
for this wedding?

606
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,000
I'm going to need all the help
I can get.

607
00:30:41,133 --> 00:30:43,100
Maybe if I don't mention the
word "wedding."

608
00:30:43,233 --> 00:30:45,000
He still has high hopes for me.

609
00:30:45,133 --> 00:30:47,166
Oh, don't let him meet my dad.

610
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,734
If it were up to him,
forget speed dating,

611
00:30:49,867 --> 00:30:51,166
it would be speed marriage.

612
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,800
Any prospects?

613
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,400
It's a long story.

614
00:30:56,233 --> 00:30:59,100
You know, honestly,
I think my Dad...

615
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:01,133
he's just thinking about Amanda.

616
00:31:01,266 --> 00:31:03,800
He wants her to have a mother
figure in her life.

617
00:31:03,934 --> 00:31:05,700
Can't say that I blame him.

618
00:31:05,834 --> 00:31:07,400
Any prospects?

619
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,967
It's complicated.

620
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,967
Well, I like to think that the
world works things out

621
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,567
the way that they're
meant to be.

622
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,667
I like to think that, too.

623
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,400
I was going to tell you,

624
00:31:20,533 --> 00:31:23,400
I'm picking up a few new
pop-ups later,

625
00:31:23,533 --> 00:31:25,467
and I thought Amanda
might want one.

626
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,166
Raise a few butterflies herself.

627
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,000
She'd love one!

628
00:31:29,133 --> 00:31:30,800
I'll stop by your house
on my way back.

629
00:31:30,934 --> 00:31:33,734
Great. Well, hey, thank you.

630
00:31:38,633 --> 00:31:40,600
Emily:
Well, would you look at that?

631
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:44,233
You want me to try to steal the
net from Amanda?

632
00:31:45,266 --> 00:31:46,700
That's a Mariposa.

633
00:31:46,834 --> 00:31:48,567
A Mariposa?

634
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,300
Spanish for butterfly.

635
00:31:50,433 --> 00:31:52,066
That's your last name.

636
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,166
Funny how the world works
things out.

637
00:32:19,767 --> 00:32:20,900
Hi.
Hi!

638
00:32:21,033 --> 00:32:22,633
Is this a good time?

639
00:32:22,767 --> 00:32:24,100
It is if you want to eat.

640
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,533
No, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to interrupt.

641
00:32:25,667 --> 00:32:26,934
No, come on. Come, come.

642
00:32:27,066 --> 00:32:28,767
And thanks for bringing the
pop-up for Amanda.

643
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,734
She doesn't get excited about
a lot of things,

644
00:32:30,867 --> 00:32:32,934
there's not a lot of friends,
but with your help,

645
00:32:33,066 --> 00:32:36,467
she's starting to emerge,
shall we say?

646
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,767
Come on.

647
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,333
Uh, okay.

648
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:43,800
That was delicious.

649
00:32:43,934 --> 00:32:46,133
Don't try his meatloaf.

650
00:32:46,266 --> 00:32:47,967
Hey.

651
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,200
So what's next for
this little one?

652
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:53,700
For starters, we need to double
the size of our Flight House.

653
00:32:53,834 --> 00:32:55,133
I can get the permits,

654
00:32:55,266 --> 00:32:56,934
but I need to find someone
who can build it.

655
00:32:57,066 --> 00:33:00,200
Pronto.
I'm your man.

656
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:04,967
I hope so.

657
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,100
Are you sure?
We're in a bit of a rush.

658
00:33:08,233 --> 00:33:11,300
I'll tell you what,
I'll clear my busy schedule.

659
00:33:11,433 --> 00:33:14,533
Well, thank you. We'll start
planning it tomorrow.

660
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,734
Oh, excuse me.

661
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,667
Thanks for the pop-up,
I'm so excited.

662
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,600
Aw, you are so welcome.
You're the best assistant.

663
00:33:25,133 --> 00:33:26,333
Surprise!

664
00:33:26,467 --> 00:33:28,967
Jill? I thought you weren't
coming until next week.

665
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,533
I was able to change my schedule.

666
00:33:30,667 --> 00:33:32,300
I wasn't expecting you.

667
00:33:35,934 --> 00:33:37,734
I missed you.
Uh, I--

668
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:40,834
Jill:
Where's Amanda?

669
00:33:40,967 --> 00:33:42,900
Garrett:
Oh, she's-- she's in there.

670
00:33:44,934 --> 00:33:46,133
Jill!

671
00:33:46,266 --> 00:33:48,100
Hey, sweetie.
Come here.

672
00:33:50,133 --> 00:33:52,200
I want to show you this really
cool pop-up.

673
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:56,300
First, I got this beautiful gift
all the way from Portugal.

674
00:33:56,433 --> 00:33:58,433
It's called a balance necklace.

675
00:33:58,567 --> 00:34:00,333
It's a reminder
that the perfect life

676
00:34:00,467 --> 00:34:02,200
is built on the goal of balance.

677
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:06,300
And it's a reminder
that you are loved.

678
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:10,934
Don't you think it's pretty?

679
00:34:12,367 --> 00:34:16,033
Yeah, it just... sparkles.

680
00:34:16,166 --> 00:34:18,567
Um, who is this?

681
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:21,166
This is Emily.
Emily is--

682
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,233
Just leaving.
Nice to meet you.

683
00:34:24,367 --> 00:34:26,567
Jill:
It was nice to meet you, too.

684
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,667
Um, excuse me for a minute.

685
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,700
Emily, wait, I can explain.

686
00:34:31,834 --> 00:34:33,433
It's none of my business.

687
00:34:33,567 --> 00:34:36,066
She's--
It's fine.

688
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,600
I'll talk to you tomorrow,
and thanks again for dinner.

689
00:35:20,266 --> 00:35:21,800
Where are we meeting her?

690
00:35:21,934 --> 00:35:23,333
18th hole.

691
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,000
Rebecca:
You're not listening!

692
00:35:27,133 --> 00:35:29,066
The putter!
It's literally right there!

693
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,600
You're not--
I don't want that!

694
00:35:30,734 --> 00:35:32,533
No! That one below.

695
00:35:37,266 --> 00:35:38,900
Is that her?

696
00:35:39,033 --> 00:35:41,000
That's her.

697
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,000
Okay.

698
00:35:57,133 --> 00:35:58,367
Man: Fore!

699
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:05,033
Obviously the best place
to have my wedding

700
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:06,500
is the O'Keefe golf course.

701
00:36:06,633 --> 00:36:08,700
My great-grandfather built it
in 1933.

702
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:12,200
The sun will be there,
no longer in anyone's eyes.

703
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:13,734
Mandy:
So smart.

704
00:36:16,767 --> 00:36:18,066
This is where the vows will be.

705
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,500
Wow, it's pretty here.

706
00:36:19,633 --> 00:36:22,000
Yeah, I like to keep it
conservation-y.

707
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,633
The vows will take 17 minutes.

708
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:26,867
I want the butterflies
to be released

709
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,800
exactly when we kiss
behind us here.

710
00:36:28,934 --> 00:36:31,166
Not a problem at all.

711
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,867
And you'll need some kind
of barrier.

712
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,333
Why?

713
00:36:35,467 --> 00:36:38,166
Well, you don't want your guests
looking at me.

714
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,967
And it's supposed to feel like
the butterflies

715
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,800
have sprung from nature.

716
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:44,734
Well, what kind of barrier?

717
00:36:44,867 --> 00:36:47,166
Shrubbery, and a few trees.

718
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,900
How is a tree going to grow in
time for the wedding?

719
00:36:52,533 --> 00:36:55,000
No, we can bring something in.

720
00:36:55,133 --> 00:36:57,467
We do it all the time.
A simple hedge will do.

721
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,467
Actually, I can decorate--

722
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,900
Mandy: You know, my team can decorate

723
00:37:01,033 --> 00:37:03,867
to match all of the flowers,
and all of the colours.

724
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,533
Mandy, that's a terrific idea.

725
00:37:06,667 --> 00:37:08,133
Mandy:
Thank you.

726
00:37:08,266 --> 00:37:09,967
So how many butterflies
can I expect?

727
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,100
At least 500, guaranteed.

728
00:37:12,233 --> 00:37:14,533
I can get you 600.
I can get you 1,000.

729
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:16,867
That's impossible,
and you know it.

730
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,467
I don't believe in impossible.

731
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,400
God never said it was impossible
to create the butterfly,

732
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:27,233
and he did, so...

733
00:37:27,367 --> 00:37:29,200
You'll both have to let me know
the day before

734
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:30,700
and I'll make my decision.

735
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:32,133
They day before?

736
00:37:33,166 --> 00:37:34,467
Is that a problem?

737
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,033
Well...

738
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:40,066
It's just that I'll be investing
a lot of time and money, and...

739
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:44,567
See, that's not my problem.
You're free to bow out.

740
00:37:45,734 --> 00:37:47,200
Now this is very important.

741
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:49,533
I want the butterflies to circle
over the two of us

742
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:51,367
before they fly away.

743
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,467
It doesn't really work
like that.

744
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,467
Well, can't butterflies be
trained?

745
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,266
No.
You know what?

746
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,767
I'm gonna look into a
butterfly wrangler

747
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,367
and get right back to you
on that.

748
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,867
Oh, come on!

749
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,867
See, Emily? Can you at least try
before you dismiss the idea?

750
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,934
Yeah, Emily, can you just try?

751
00:38:17,033 --> 00:38:19,166
I've been wanting to expand for
a while.

752
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,867
This is great.

753
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,500
Well, this is our expansion
project?

754
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,734
Son of a bee sting!
Are you okay?

755
00:39:25,233 --> 00:39:27,066
Let me see. Let me see.

756
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,000
I think we're done for today.

757
00:39:47,367 --> 00:39:49,500
There you go.
Don't worry, it's decaf.

758
00:39:49,633 --> 00:39:51,900
Ow!
Oh...

759
00:39:52,033 --> 00:39:53,400
How's the thumb?

760
00:39:53,533 --> 00:39:55,300
It-- I'll live.

761
00:39:55,433 --> 00:39:58,066
I just hope it doesn't detract
from a job well done.

762
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:02,767
Are you kidding?
This is going to be amazing.

763
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,800
Beyond just our business,

764
00:40:04,934 --> 00:40:07,166
this will be a real butterfly sanctuary.

765
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,834
Well, it was always my dream to
save the butterflies.

766
00:40:13,433 --> 00:40:15,100
So, um...

767
00:40:15,233 --> 00:40:16,900
When will the caterpillars
be ready?

768
00:40:17,033 --> 00:40:18,433
Three days.

769
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,066
And what's the word on
Mandy Fischer?

770
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,600
Well, she's been after
the same vendors.

771
00:40:25,734 --> 00:40:28,000
But inside sources tell me

772
00:40:28,133 --> 00:40:30,667
that she doesn't have
the same numbers.

773
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,800
You know, is it--
is it really worth all this

774
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:38,166
if Rebecca just ends up picking
Mandy in the end?

775
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:42,667
Okay, well, A, I'm not going to
lose to Mandy Fischer.

776
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,133
Wait, sorry, what--

777
00:40:45,266 --> 00:40:46,433
what is your deal with her?

778
00:40:46,567 --> 00:40:50,433
It seems like it's just a
business to her.

779
00:40:51,467 --> 00:40:55,300
She does kitten parties,
puppies too.

780
00:40:55,433 --> 00:40:58,767
Butterflies are just a number.

781
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,967
And I have a connection to butterflies

782
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,900
and their place in this world.

783
00:41:03,033 --> 00:41:05,734
And I like to teach people
the importance of that.

784
00:41:05,867 --> 00:41:09,867
Okay, so don't lose to
Mandy Fischer.

785
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,500
And B?

786
00:41:12,967 --> 00:41:14,633
B...

787
00:41:14,767 --> 00:41:17,767
Yes, it's been worth it.

788
00:41:19,633 --> 00:41:21,567
Yeah, it has.

789
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,533
Okay, I'm sorry.

790
00:41:27,667 --> 00:41:28,834
I don't get it.

791
00:41:28,967 --> 00:41:31,200
I feel like there's this...

792
00:41:31,333 --> 00:41:33,800
this thing here.

793
00:41:33,934 --> 00:41:35,667
There's a thing?

794
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,867
Well, us.

795
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,633
There, that look?

796
00:41:39,767 --> 00:41:42,633
That's not how someone typically
looks at me,

797
00:41:42,767 --> 00:41:44,900
and that's not how, typically,
I look at someone.

798
00:41:45,934 --> 00:41:47,800
Yeah, me either.

799
00:41:48,834 --> 00:41:50,533
There, you--
you just did it again.

800
00:41:50,667 --> 00:41:53,467
I'm sorry, I don't know how
I'm looking at you.

801
00:41:57,633 --> 00:42:00,633
No, I don't want you to be
sorry, I just...

802
00:42:00,767 --> 00:42:02,367
I don't get it.

803
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,367
Jill.

804
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,767
Yes. Jill.

805
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,600
I told you, it's complicated.

806
00:42:13,734 --> 00:42:17,800
Well, I'm not complicated, Garrett.

807
00:42:17,934 --> 00:42:21,533
You either have a girlfriend
or you don't.

808
00:42:21,667 --> 00:42:22,767
I don't.

809
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,867
You kissed her.
She kissed me.

810
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,567
And you know,
just for the record,

811
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:30,600
she's not staying at my house.
Jill is my ex-girlfriend.

812
00:42:30,734 --> 00:42:33,467
She's always been a big part
of Amanda's life.

813
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:37,400
We stayed friends,
and probably always be friends.

814
00:42:39,433 --> 00:42:41,567
So what happened?

815
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,867
Well,

816
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,266
she works for the state department,

817
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,533
and she was assigned overseas.

818
00:42:50,667 --> 00:42:54,467
She was there for a few months,
and we just...

819
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,400
We kinda lost our way.

820
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:01,600
And what, she's found it again?

821
00:43:01,734 --> 00:43:03,600
Yeah, yeah, she has.

822
00:43:03,734 --> 00:43:05,867
She's stationed back
in New York.

823
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,266
Which is part of the reason why
my dad wants me to go back,

824
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,200
because he is all for this reconciliation.

825
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:11,533
And you?

826
00:43:11,667 --> 00:43:14,934
Jill and I have this history.
Amanda adores her,

827
00:43:15,066 --> 00:43:17,000
she's a great role model
for Amanda.

828
00:43:17,133 --> 00:43:19,033
I think Jill is curious to see

829
00:43:19,166 --> 00:43:21,333
if there's something
still there.

830
00:43:21,467 --> 00:43:23,166
Is there?

831
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,100
I don't know.

832
00:43:25,233 --> 00:43:27,166
And you know, I think that's
what's bothering me,

833
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:31,467
because I feel like I should.

834
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,300
It's a lame answer, I know.
I'm sorry.

835
00:43:34,433 --> 00:43:37,100
No, it's an honest answer.

836
00:43:37,233 --> 00:43:39,600
Honestly, yeah,
I wanted to give it a try.

837
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,500
Until...

838
00:43:42,633 --> 00:43:45,033
Until what?

839
00:43:45,166 --> 00:43:46,633
Until the unexpected.

840
00:43:50,233 --> 00:43:54,000
And, um... you know,

841
00:43:54,133 --> 00:43:57,100
I realize that Jill and I...

842
00:43:57,233 --> 00:43:59,533
weren't always compatible.

843
00:43:59,667 --> 00:44:02,100
She doesn't really appreciate
a guy who gets his hands dirty.

844
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:07,233
You know what's funny is my grandfather,

845
00:44:07,367 --> 00:44:09,700
he wasn't a businessman.

846
00:44:09,834 --> 00:44:13,900
He just got lucky on
some stocks.

847
00:44:14,033 --> 00:44:16,567
But before that,
he was a carpenter.

848
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:20,100
He could build anything,
fix anything,

849
00:44:20,233 --> 00:44:22,734
that was his trade.

850
00:44:22,867 --> 00:44:24,600
It was until the day
that he died.

851
00:44:24,734 --> 00:44:27,600
It's in your blood.

852
00:44:27,734 --> 00:44:31,200
Well, it might skip a generation

853
00:44:31,333 --> 00:44:34,266
but it's in there.

854
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,333
Did you know that the Monarch butterfly

855
00:44:37,467 --> 00:44:40,333
migrates down to Mexico
each year?

856
00:44:40,467 --> 00:44:42,533
That's where they lay
their eggs,

857
00:44:42,667 --> 00:44:45,033
and then they migrate back here.

858
00:44:45,166 --> 00:44:49,133
The entire cycle takes three
generations, sometimes five.

859
00:44:51,033 --> 00:44:52,667
I didn't know that.

860
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:58,100
Each generation relies on the
next to carry its legacy.

861
00:45:44,734 --> 00:45:46,100
What a day.

862
00:45:46,233 --> 00:45:47,567
I got in the three orders we needed.

863
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,567
I'm calling two other places tomorrow.

864
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,600
If Taylor Brothers comes through,

865
00:45:51,734 --> 00:45:53,000
we should be covered.

866
00:45:53,133 --> 00:45:55,734
Only thing I'm worried about
is the timing.

867
00:45:57,767 --> 00:46:00,300
You didn't hear a word I said.

868
00:46:00,433 --> 00:46:01,967
Sorry.

869
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,033
What's going on?

870
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,367
It's what I thought.

871
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,066
Ex-girlfriend.

872
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,467
Long history.
Back in the picture.

873
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,533
Get out.

874
00:46:15,667 --> 00:46:16,900
I don't get it.

875
00:46:17,033 --> 00:46:19,133
The guy has a total crush
on you.

876
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,166
It's complicated.

877
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,000
Please.

878
00:46:26,133 --> 00:46:28,667
No, by definition, it's true.

879
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,734
He doesn't know what he wants.

880
00:46:30,867 --> 00:46:32,667
That's because he's a guy.

881
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,834
No, it's because he's confused.

882
00:46:35,967 --> 00:46:37,667
So un-confuse him.

883
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,066
I don't even know what I want.

884
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:45,667
Maybe I'm just feeling
stupidly rejected.

885
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,734
I hardly know him.

886
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:52,834
Well, how do you feel when
you're around him?

887
00:46:55,867 --> 00:46:59,667
Like I have butterflies
in my stomach.

888
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:04,533
Adam:
Then don't let him flutter away.

889
00:47:04,667 --> 00:47:06,066
See you tomorrow.

890
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,300
You're the best, Adam.

891
00:47:12,333 --> 00:47:13,800
Working on it.

892
00:47:31,667 --> 00:47:33,467
Morning!

893
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,800
Morning.

894
00:47:36,033 --> 00:47:37,467
Still like it with cream
and cinnamon?

895
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,233
Garrett:
Yeah, that's perfect.

896
00:47:40,367 --> 00:47:42,767
See, it's like we've hardly
been apart.

897
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,333
Hardly.

898
00:47:45,467 --> 00:47:46,700
Have you started packing?

899
00:47:46,834 --> 00:47:49,200
I've been a little busy.

900
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:50,667
Doing what?

901
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,200
Well, you know,
I work for a living here, Jill.

902
00:47:54,333 --> 00:47:56,400
But it's more of a hobby,
though, isn't it?

903
00:47:56,533 --> 00:47:59,000
Your father is going to set you
up with a real career.

904
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,100
What's going on?

905
00:48:02,233 --> 00:48:04,433
This is not fair.

906
00:48:04,567 --> 00:48:06,867
It's not fair that you just come
back into my life

907
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,567
like it hasn't been two years.
Like I haven't moved on.

908
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:13,400
It's not like we haven't seen
each other in those two years.

909
00:48:13,533 --> 00:48:14,900
You're right.

910
00:48:16,233 --> 00:48:18,300
The butterfly lady?

911
00:48:18,433 --> 00:48:19,867
How long has that been going on?

912
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,700
No, nothing is going on.
I hardly know her.

913
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:26,734
Well then let's not throw away
all the time we had together.

914
00:48:26,867 --> 00:48:29,133
We had something really special.

915
00:48:29,266 --> 00:48:30,800
Had, Jill.

916
00:48:30,934 --> 00:48:34,100
We had something really special.
That's the key word.

917
00:48:34,233 --> 00:48:35,734
I have some news.

918
00:48:35,867 --> 00:48:37,967
I spoke to Amy Pritchard
at Breck Academy,

919
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:41,700
my alma mater, and sent in
an application for Amanda.

920
00:48:41,834 --> 00:48:43,033
What?

921
00:48:43,166 --> 00:48:44,200
I know I should have asked,

922
00:48:44,333 --> 00:48:45,867
but I didn't
want you to say no.

923
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,066
No, you should have discussed
this with me.

924
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,800
I wanted it to be a surprise.

925
00:48:49,934 --> 00:48:52,200
It's the best school in
New York, Garrett.

926
00:48:52,333 --> 00:48:54,133
All the money in the world
can't get you in.

927
00:48:54,266 --> 00:48:55,800
It's gonna take all the money in
the world to pay for it!

928
00:48:55,934 --> 00:48:57,600
Which is why taking over your
father's company

929
00:48:57,734 --> 00:49:00,467
is so important.
Think about Amanda,

930
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,300
and what this would mean
for her future.

931
00:49:03,433 --> 00:49:04,834
Daddy! Look!

932
00:49:04,967 --> 00:49:07,600
I found a caterpillar from the
pop-up that Emily gave me!

933
00:49:07,734 --> 00:49:08,867
That's great!

934
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,600
Do you want to come
and see it too, Jill?

935
00:49:10,734 --> 00:49:15,100
Sure, sweetie. Let's see.

936
00:49:15,233 --> 00:49:17,433
Wow! That is so cool!

937
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:19,500
Thanks!
I'm so proud of you.

938
00:49:19,633 --> 00:49:21,166
Amanda: Thank you.
Jill: Come here.

939
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,033
Aww.

940
00:49:23,166 --> 00:49:26,333
Listen, I've gotta run,
but we'll talk later, okay?

941
00:49:26,467 --> 00:49:28,000
Okay.

942
00:49:28,133 --> 00:49:29,300
Bye, sweetie.

943
00:49:29,433 --> 00:49:30,767
Bye, Jill.

944
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,934
Hey! Looking good.

945
00:49:38,066 --> 00:49:39,467
I'll clean all this up later,
you know,

946
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,934
I'll put down some sod.
How are the orders coming?

947
00:49:42,066 --> 00:49:44,834
We're all set.
Just a matter of logistics now.

948
00:49:44,967 --> 00:49:47,367
I think we're actually going
to pull this off.

949
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:50,700
Eat your heart out,
Mandy Fischer.

950
00:49:50,834 --> 00:49:54,433
Hey, you've got something
on your--

951
00:49:54,567 --> 00:49:56,033
Just up on your--

952
00:49:56,166 --> 00:49:57,633
On my face?

953
00:49:57,767 --> 00:49:58,967
Up here?

954
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:01,667
Yeah. A little bit down.

955
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,800
Just like, here? I--

956
00:50:04,934 --> 00:50:06,934
Here, I'll--
Oh yeah?

957
00:50:07,066 --> 00:50:08,166
Let me help you.
No, no, no, no!

958
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:09,467
Why not?

959
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,033
I'm just helping you!
Don't!

960
00:50:11,166 --> 00:50:12,300
Don't you dare.

961
00:50:12,433 --> 00:50:14,767
Okay, okay. Fine.

962
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,200
Peace.

963
00:50:21,233 --> 00:50:23,633
Oh!

964
00:50:23,767 --> 00:50:25,000
Okay, now I'm--

965
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,800
Oh no!
Are you okay?

966
00:50:27,934 --> 00:50:29,300
Okay, I surrender.
I surrender.

967
00:50:29,433 --> 00:50:32,100
White flag.

968
00:50:35,734 --> 00:50:36,834
Emily: No...

969
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:38,100
That's not a new shirt, is it?

970
00:50:38,233 --> 00:50:39,633
Oh, I'm gonna get you.

971
00:50:39,767 --> 00:50:40,867
Oh yeah?
Yeah.

972
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,133
If you can catch me!

973
00:50:42,266 --> 00:50:43,367
You better run!

974
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,200
Hey, you've got something
on your face.

975
00:51:06,066 --> 00:51:09,000
Look at that. It's a dragon.

976
00:51:09,133 --> 00:51:12,500
You can see the head
and the tail and the wings.

977
00:51:13,533 --> 00:51:15,000
That's an elephant.

978
00:51:19,633 --> 00:51:21,700
Oh yeah. It's an elephant.

979
00:51:21,834 --> 00:51:24,600
That one right there?

980
00:51:24,734 --> 00:51:25,867
A butterfly.

981
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,066
Everything is a butterfly
with you.

982
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:40,200
Any decisions yet?

983
00:51:40,333 --> 00:51:43,333
I just have to think what's best
for Amanda.

984
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:46,066
Whatever makes her happy.

985
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,333
I don't even think she knows
what makes her happy.

986
00:51:50,367 --> 00:51:51,834
Do you?

987
00:52:04,467 --> 00:52:05,867
Whoa

988
00:52:07,066 --> 00:52:08,233
What?

989
00:52:08,367 --> 00:52:09,834
Adam:
Nothing, you look great.

990
00:52:09,967 --> 00:52:11,934
This is bound to turn his head.

991
00:52:12,066 --> 00:52:16,567
Oh please, this is not an
attempt to change his mind.

992
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:19,166
Will you just tell him how you
feel already?

993
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:21,166
Yeah, that would be a little obvious.

994
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:23,166
At least you'll know.

995
00:52:34,867 --> 00:52:36,100
What?

996
00:52:36,233 --> 00:52:38,834
He's not supposed to come until
this afternoon.

997
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:47,900
Rebecca.

998
00:52:48,033 --> 00:52:50,834
I've called you three times.
We need to talk.

999
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:58,834
Emily: Uh, well, I didn't get
any messages.

1000
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:01,867
Mandy Fischer answers on the
first ring.

1001
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,734
You must be Adam.

1002
00:53:03,867 --> 00:53:06,300
I am, nice to meet you.

1003
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:08,967
We have a problem.
What problem?

1004
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:10,800
Christi Cameron.

1005
00:53:10,934 --> 00:53:12,567
I'm not following.

1006
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:15,300
Best friend.
Was best friend.

1007
00:53:15,433 --> 00:53:17,900
She released 1,500 butterflies
at a charity event

1008
00:53:18,033 --> 00:53:19,567
in New York last week.

1009
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:22,467
Mandy Fischer says she can
deliver 1,501.

1010
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,467
But I get the impression Mandy
Fischer just says

1011
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,000
whatever I want to hear.

1012
00:53:26,133 --> 00:53:27,967
I will not let
Christi Cameron best me.

1013
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:30,567
Can you do it? Say yes now
and the job is yours.

1014
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:32,567
Yes.

1015
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:36,233
Uh, all we can promise is our
best effort, Rebecca.

1016
00:53:36,367 --> 00:53:39,233
I know two vendors that might
be able to help,

1017
00:53:39,367 --> 00:53:41,900
but it's a long shot, so...

1018
00:53:42,033 --> 00:53:43,767
But that's a yes, right?

1019
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,867
You'll be on the cover of
Wedding Weekly.

1020
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,033
Okay, yes.

1021
00:53:50,166 --> 00:53:53,567
I knew it.
And don't forget, 1,501.

1022
00:54:03,934 --> 00:54:06,333
You look really nice today,
by the way.

1023
00:54:07,934 --> 00:54:09,133
Thank you.

1024
00:54:09,266 --> 00:54:12,233
Remind me to set you up
with someone at the wedding.

1025
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,266
Congratulations!

1026
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,367
You know I'm not out
of the woods yet.

1027
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:28,266
You know, I could-- I could go
get the caterpillars for you.

1028
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,533
Thank you.

1029
00:54:31,667 --> 00:54:33,867
Thank you, but I--
I have to do it.

1030
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,700
I need to inspect them and make
sure the count is right.

1031
00:54:36,834 --> 00:54:39,533
Well, how are you planning
on being in two places at once?

1032
00:54:39,667 --> 00:54:42,900
Magic. An act of God? I...

1033
00:54:43,033 --> 00:54:45,433
I haven't figured it out yet.

1034
00:54:45,567 --> 00:54:48,967
You know, um, Amanda and I,

1035
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:51,233
we could do one of the parties.

1036
00:54:51,367 --> 00:54:52,900
I hadn't thought of that.

1037
00:54:53,033 --> 00:54:54,767
Well, Adam is doing the
retirement party,

1038
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,633
and the other one is a birthday
party, just a small one?

1039
00:54:57,767 --> 00:55:00,667
A couple dozen butterflies?
We could handle that.

1040
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,300
Are you sure?
Absolutely.

1041
00:55:02,433 --> 00:55:04,700
I mean, Amanda's been trained by
the best, right?

1042
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:06,467
Thank you. Thanks.

1043
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,200
Okay. Sure!

1044
00:55:08,333 --> 00:55:10,934
What am I going to do
without you?

1045
00:55:11,066 --> 00:55:13,967
I just mean, after this,

1046
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:15,767
we're going to hit the big time,

1047
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:18,367
and, well, you'll be missed.

1048
00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:20,967
Will I?

1049
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,233
Hi, Emily, how are you?

1050
00:55:38,367 --> 00:55:40,800
Panicked as usual, Taylor.
Thank you.

1051
00:55:40,934 --> 00:55:42,166
I wanted to tell you,

1052
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:44,133
there's a clean survival rate
on the larva.

1053
00:55:44,266 --> 00:55:46,100
This is a good crop of caterpillars.

1054
00:55:46,233 --> 00:55:48,233
Great. What ratio do you think
we can expect?

1055
00:55:48,367 --> 00:55:49,467
80-20.

1056
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,100
That'll do!

1057
00:55:51,233 --> 00:55:53,567
However, the OE has begun
to spread again.

1058
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:57,100
A nasty little parasite
wiping out a lot of Monarchs.

1059
00:55:57,233 --> 00:55:59,500
But it hasn't reached this
far yet, has it?

1060
00:55:59,633 --> 00:56:01,500
All it takes is one bad apple.

1061
00:56:01,633 --> 00:56:03,367
That's why we're shutting down
for a week.

1062
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:04,667
Be extra careful.

1063
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,300
We will.

1064
00:56:06,433 --> 00:56:08,000
Come on, I've got four crates
waiting for you.

1065
00:56:08,133 --> 00:56:09,333
Let's get them loaded up.

1066
00:56:09,467 --> 00:56:10,834
Thanks, Taylor.

1067
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:21,800
Hey! How'd it go?
It went great!

1068
00:56:21,934 --> 00:56:24,800
All of the butterflies flew away
like they were supposed to,

1069
00:56:24,934 --> 00:56:27,533
and one even landed on one of
the kids' noses.

1070
00:56:27,667 --> 00:56:29,667
Really?!

1071
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,033
Oh, well, I'm glad to hear.

1072
00:56:31,166 --> 00:56:32,300
Yeah, I was hardly needed.

1073
00:56:32,433 --> 00:56:34,333
I'm not surprised.

1074
00:56:34,467 --> 00:56:37,700
The girl's mother already texted
me and said you both were great.

1075
00:56:37,834 --> 00:56:40,367
And thank you for the updates,
it eased my mind.

1076
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,166
How'd it go?
Well...

1077
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:47,734
They're all here.

1078
00:56:47,867 --> 00:56:49,033
Amanda, do you want to help me

1079
00:56:49,166 --> 00:56:50,533
set the caterpillars into
their new homes?

1080
00:56:50,667 --> 00:56:52,166
Yeah.
Okay.

1081
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:54,300
You take this one,
I'll follow you in.

1082
00:56:54,433 --> 00:56:55,967
Why don't you guys get started?
I'll grab the rest.

1083
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:57,333
Thanks.

1084
00:57:04,333 --> 00:57:05,633
What are you doing?

1085
00:57:05,767 --> 00:57:06,900
This is my friend.

1086
00:57:07,033 --> 00:57:09,700
Oh! Does your friend
have a name?

1087
00:57:09,834 --> 00:57:11,066
Sarah.

1088
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,734
That's a pretty name.
How did you come up with that?

1089
00:57:13,867 --> 00:57:15,734
Well, my mom's name was Sarah.

1090
00:57:15,867 --> 00:57:17,233
Oh.

1091
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:22,233
I found her in the woods,

1092
00:57:22,367 --> 00:57:24,233
that's why she's in this
little habitat.

1093
00:57:24,367 --> 00:57:26,100
Daddy said that Mommy loved butterflies.

1094
00:57:26,233 --> 00:57:27,533
Really?

1095
00:57:27,667 --> 00:57:30,800
Yeah, I guess that's why
I like them so much.

1096
00:57:30,934 --> 00:57:32,200
I'm sure that's why.

1097
00:57:32,333 --> 00:57:35,200
You know, I'm kinda sad
that she's not here to help us.

1098
00:57:35,333 --> 00:57:36,967
I think that she really would
have liked it.

1099
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:40,600
Well, you know what I believe?

1100
00:57:40,734 --> 00:57:42,867
I believe that she's here
right now.

1101
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,233
Just in ways that we can't see.

1102
00:57:45,367 --> 00:57:47,433
You mean like an angel?
Mm-hm.

1103
00:57:47,567 --> 00:57:49,734
Do you think it's possible
for humans

1104
00:57:49,867 --> 00:57:51,700
to grow wings when they
go to heaven?

1105
00:57:51,834 --> 00:57:54,600
Well, I don't know if they grow
wings exactly,

1106
00:57:54,734 --> 00:57:56,867
but we have to get there somehow.

1107
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,467
Do you think a caterpillar knows
that one day,

1108
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:02,300
it will grow wings and fly?

1109
00:58:02,433 --> 00:58:04,767
That would seem pretty
impossible, wouldn't it?

1110
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:06,633
I guess so.

1111
00:58:06,767 --> 00:58:09,433
Well, this world we're in,

1112
00:58:09,567 --> 00:58:12,100
we think it's so big
and amazing.

1113
00:58:12,233 --> 00:58:14,633
Just like a caterpillar sees it.

1114
00:58:16,667 --> 00:58:19,333
But then it changes into something

1115
00:58:19,467 --> 00:58:22,166
so beautiful and wondrous

1116
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,934
that it can't even imagine the
way it was before.

1117
00:58:25,066 --> 00:58:27,467
Yeah.

1118
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,166
Trust me.

1119
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:32,433
Your mom is watching over you.

1120
00:58:32,567 --> 00:58:35,300
And she must be very proud.

1121
00:58:35,433 --> 00:58:36,700
And I'll tell you what.

1122
00:58:36,834 --> 00:58:38,967
We'll keep a special eye
on Sarah here,

1123
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:41,667
and when she decides
it's her time,

1124
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,433
we can watch her fly away together.

1125
00:58:43,567 --> 00:58:45,100
Deal?
Deal.

1126
00:58:45,233 --> 00:58:46,600
Okay.

1127
00:58:51,066 --> 00:58:53,934
So why don't you do this
the day before?

1128
00:58:54,066 --> 00:58:56,166
You know you're going to have to
water these every day.

1129
00:58:56,300 --> 00:59:00,200
Rebecca insisted.
She leaves nothing to chance.

1130
00:59:00,333 --> 00:59:04,033
She even got flowers that will
bloom in exactly seven days,

1131
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:06,734
eight hours, and 47 minutes,

1132
00:59:06,867 --> 00:59:08,266
just as they're saying
their vows.

1133
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,567
You're kidding.

1134
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:11,166
I kid not.

1135
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:13,734
Well then, you better hope
1,500 butterflies

1136
00:59:13,867 --> 00:59:16,066
show themselves to the world
when they're supposed to.

1137
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,433
1,501.

1138
00:59:18,567 --> 00:59:22,066
Well, that's looking
pretty good.

1139
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:25,734
We'll never be able to see the
man behind the curtain.

1140
00:59:25,867 --> 00:59:29,200
Thanks for helping.
Can I buy you lunch?

1141
00:59:29,333 --> 00:59:32,166
Well, a wise man once said,

1142
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:34,100
never turn down a free lunch.

1143
00:59:50,233 --> 00:59:53,000
So what do you think?

1144
00:59:53,133 --> 00:59:55,166
Gourmet burgers in a place
like this?

1145
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,033
How can you beat it?

1146
00:59:57,166 --> 00:59:58,934
I don't think you can.

1147
00:59:59,066 --> 01:00:00,600
How'd you find this place,
anyways?

1148
01:00:01,834 --> 01:00:03,266
I got engaged here.

1149
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,000
You're engaged?

1150
01:00:05,133 --> 01:00:06,700
Up until a year ago.

1151
01:00:06,834 --> 01:00:09,166
But this is where he proposed.

1152
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,400
Do you mind if I ask
what happened?

1153
01:00:13,533 --> 01:00:15,500
We were together
for a few years,

1154
01:00:15,633 --> 01:00:18,667
and happy, I thought.

1155
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:22,567
He proposed, I said yes, and...

1156
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:25,033
He changed his mind.

1157
01:00:25,166 --> 01:00:26,867
I'm sorry.

1158
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,967
I'm surprised I didn't think of
that before I brought you here.

1159
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:36,000
Maybe that's because it just
doesn't matter anymore.

1160
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:37,533
That's why you didn't
think about it.

1161
01:00:37,667 --> 01:00:39,867
So it doesn't have to
take away from...

1162
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,600
from all of this.

1163
01:00:43,066 --> 01:00:45,433
Yeah. You're right.

1164
01:00:45,567 --> 01:00:48,100
You know, I feel like I'm
seeing this place

1165
01:00:48,233 --> 01:00:50,033
in a whole new light.

1166
01:01:07,233 --> 01:01:09,133
Great.

1167
01:01:09,266 --> 01:01:10,900
What? Who is it?

1168
01:01:11,033 --> 01:01:13,767
Oh, that's my Dad's car.

1169
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:15,266
What, it's a bad thing?

1170
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:19,000
No, I love my Dad, but sometimes
he has no boundaries.

1171
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:20,667
He's taking a baking class,

1172
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:23,900
and he just shows up
assuming I want to bake.

1173
01:01:24,033 --> 01:01:25,767
Baking class?
Yeah.

1174
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:28,600
Apparently a great spot to meet
women his age.

1175
01:01:28,734 --> 01:01:30,600
Would you come in and meet him,

1176
01:01:30,734 --> 01:01:33,100
or else I'll never hear
the end of it.

1177
01:01:33,233 --> 01:01:34,633
I don't want to intrude.

1178
01:01:34,767 --> 01:01:36,266
Especially during baking time.

1179
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,000
Trust me, it will be
another favour.

1180
01:01:45,367 --> 01:01:46,600
Hello.

1181
01:01:46,734 --> 01:01:47,900
You didn't answer your
text messages.

1182
01:01:48,033 --> 01:01:49,133
Uh, my phone died.

1183
01:01:49,266 --> 01:01:51,066
Nonsense.

1184
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,600
What are we into for today, Dad?

1185
01:01:52,734 --> 01:01:54,166
Cookies.

1186
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:55,767
Chocolate marble.

1187
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:57,467
Sounds great. Dad, this is--

1188
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:59,066
So this is him.

1189
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,033
Garrett.
Nice to finally meet you.

1190
01:02:01,166 --> 01:02:02,400
Nice to meet you, Mr. Mar--

1191
01:02:02,533 --> 01:02:04,800
Larry. Call me Larry.

1192
01:02:04,934 --> 01:02:07,367
Larry.

1193
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:08,800
I can see why you have such a
crush on him.

1194
01:02:08,934 --> 01:02:10,233
Dad!

1195
01:02:10,367 --> 01:02:11,734
Yeah, she talks about you all
the time.

1196
01:02:11,867 --> 01:02:12,800
She goes on and on about you.

1197
01:02:12,934 --> 01:02:14,133
She does?
Yeah.

1198
01:02:14,266 --> 01:02:15,667
No, really, I haven't.

1199
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:16,967
Did she tell you
that her fiancé left her

1200
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:19,066
standing at the altar last year?

1201
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,000
No.
Dad!

1202
01:02:21,133 --> 01:02:23,400
Listen, that saying,
"Once bitten, twice shy?"

1203
01:02:23,533 --> 01:02:25,333
Thrice, is that a word?
'Cause if it is, it's her.

1204
01:02:25,467 --> 01:02:26,967
Okay, stop. Now.

1205
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:29,000
Oh, she thinks
I'm embarrassing her.

1206
01:02:29,133 --> 01:02:31,133
You are embarrassing me!

1207
01:02:31,266 --> 01:02:34,166
Don't you think
she's absolutely lovely?

1208
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:36,133
I do.

1209
01:02:36,266 --> 01:02:37,400
You do?

1210
01:02:37,533 --> 01:02:38,900
Then why haven't you
told her yet?

1211
01:02:39,033 --> 01:02:42,367
It's complicated.
Oh, yes, so I've heard.

1212
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,400
Dad, your cookies are burning!

1213
01:02:44,533 --> 01:02:46,400
Nice try. They're not in
the oven yet.

1214
01:02:46,533 --> 01:02:51,200
Listen, things are only
complicated until they're not.

1215
01:02:52,667 --> 01:02:54,333
Oh, excuse me.

1216
01:02:54,467 --> 01:02:56,266
Phone snakes!
Play nice.

1217
01:02:57,867 --> 01:02:59,667
I've got all kinds of stories
that I can tell you

1218
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,600
about my little baby.

1219
01:03:01,734 --> 01:03:02,900
Hello?

1220
01:03:03,033 --> 01:03:05,467
Emily, we're in trouble.
Get here now.

1221
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:07,233
Yeah, I'll be right there.

1222
01:03:08,867 --> 01:03:10,367
We've gotta go.

1223
01:03:33,266 --> 01:03:34,967
We lost almost half the caterpillars.

1224
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:36,300
What?

1225
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:39,667
Have a look.
I put one under the scope.

1226
01:03:49,266 --> 01:03:52,166
What?
OE.

1227
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:54,900
OE. Ophryocystis elektroscirrha.

1228
01:03:55,033 --> 01:03:57,467
It's a parasite that infects Monarchs.

1229
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,734
Do you see how dark it is?

1230
01:03:59,867 --> 01:04:02,300
Yeah. How did that happen?

1231
01:04:02,433 --> 01:04:05,033
Pesticides on milkweed
is the most common reason.

1232
01:04:05,166 --> 01:04:08,400
Farmers are using it to control
the spread of the gypsy moth.

1233
01:04:08,533 --> 01:04:11,133
Which means other rhopalocera
get caught in the crossfire.

1234
01:04:12,367 --> 01:04:13,600
Butterflies.

1235
01:04:13,734 --> 01:04:16,066
Emily, I swear I washed
everything I brought in.

1236
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:19,300
No, no, it's not your fault.

1237
01:04:19,433 --> 01:04:20,767
Some of the powders and sprays
they use now

1238
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:22,400
are impossible to get out.

1239
01:04:22,533 --> 01:04:24,800
Or an infected insect
got in here.

1240
01:04:24,934 --> 01:04:27,233
Taylor warned me
that there was an outbreak.

1241
01:04:27,367 --> 01:04:29,734
This happens all the time
in the wild.

1242
01:04:29,867 --> 01:04:32,700
Millions of butterflies every
single year.

1243
01:04:32,834 --> 01:04:35,800
Between them and our bee
population dying off,

1244
01:04:35,934 --> 01:04:38,400
our entire ecosystem is
in jeopardy.

1245
01:04:38,533 --> 01:04:39,934
So what do we do?

1246
01:04:41,667 --> 01:04:44,400
First, we need to isolate the
surviving caterpillars

1247
01:04:44,533 --> 01:04:45,800
for the next few days.

1248
01:04:45,934 --> 01:04:48,633
And we need to look for some
milkweed in the wild.

1249
01:04:49,667 --> 01:04:51,400
We can't take
any more chances.

1250
01:04:51,533 --> 01:04:54,266
Emily, we have a bigger problem.

1251
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:55,734
I know.

1252
01:04:55,867 --> 01:05:00,300
We're going to need at
least 700 more caterpillars.

1253
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,767
How many do you have? 50?

1254
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:09,834
No, it was OE. We're pretty sure
it's run its course.

1255
01:05:09,967 --> 01:05:11,266
Whatever you can give us.

1256
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:12,800
Jared, it's Emily. Hi.

1257
01:05:12,934 --> 01:05:15,600
I know, it's awful.
But can you help us out?

1258
01:05:15,734 --> 01:05:18,000
I'll call them. Thank you.

1259
01:05:21,967 --> 01:05:23,467
Farmer:
Here's what I can spare.

1260
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:24,800
Thanks,
I really appreciate this.

1261
01:05:24,934 --> 01:05:26,834
Farmer:
Hope it's enough.

1262
01:05:26,967 --> 01:05:28,367
Take care!

1263
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,867
Is this all you have?

1264
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,200
Farmer:
Yeah, this is all of it.

1265
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:39,333
Thank you.
No problem.

1266
01:06:07,533 --> 01:06:08,834
How short are we?

1267
01:06:08,967 --> 01:06:10,500
Four hundred.

1268
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:13,000
We're never going to find
another 400 caterpillars.

1269
01:06:13,133 --> 01:06:14,600
We've called everyone.

1270
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,000
Not everyone.

1271
01:06:23,867 --> 01:06:25,667
This is going to be painful.

1272
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:48,300
You've got to be joking.

1273
01:06:56,467 --> 01:07:00,600
So let me get this straight.
Now you want my help,

1274
01:07:00,734 --> 01:07:03,300
after you've swooped in and
stole the job from me.

1275
01:07:03,433 --> 01:07:05,900
I didn't steal it.
She chose me.

1276
01:07:06,033 --> 01:07:08,266
Mm-hm, after you
convinced her to.

1277
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,633
Well, duh. Ladies.

1278
01:07:10,767 --> 01:07:13,233
Maybe we should just stick to
the subject at hand?

1279
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:16,800
Do you have 400 caterpillars?

1280
01:07:16,934 --> 01:07:18,900
Well, obviously I do,

1281
01:07:19,033 --> 01:07:21,233
if I was prepared to give 1,500.

1282
01:07:21,367 --> 01:07:24,233
Well, I know that's what you
told Rebecca, but--

1283
01:07:24,367 --> 01:07:27,000
Okay. Fine.

1284
01:07:27,133 --> 01:07:28,667
I wouldn't have come close.

1285
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,533
I don't even have 400.

1286
01:07:33,133 --> 01:07:35,400
Well, we'll take whatever
you have.

1287
01:07:35,533 --> 01:07:37,767
I'm not just going to
sell them to you.

1288
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:41,166
What, so you get all the press
and all the glory?

1289
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:42,800
I don't want to buy them.

1290
01:07:42,934 --> 01:07:45,367
I'm not just going to give
them to you.

1291
01:07:46,967 --> 01:07:49,734
I can't believe I'm saying this, but...

1292
01:07:50,767 --> 01:07:52,834
let's team up together.

1293
01:07:52,967 --> 01:07:54,100
I'm sorry, what?
I'm sorry, what?

1294
01:07:54,233 --> 01:07:56,300
We can do this together.

1295
01:07:56,433 --> 01:08:00,233
Let's make this event
one no one will ever forget.

1296
01:08:00,367 --> 01:08:02,166
Are you being serious?

1297
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:04,200
Yes.

1298
01:08:04,333 --> 01:08:07,133
Well, I don't know what to say.

1299
01:08:09,166 --> 01:08:13,033
To a new partnership?

1300
01:08:13,166 --> 01:08:14,834
Uh...
If--

1301
01:08:14,967 --> 01:08:16,467
If what?

1302
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:19,500
If you promise to learn more
about butterflies.

1303
01:08:19,633 --> 01:08:22,834
Why they're so special,
what they do for our world,

1304
01:08:22,967 --> 01:08:25,300
and why what we do is
so important.

1305
01:08:25,433 --> 01:08:27,967
I want you to love them
as much as I do.

1306
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:30,033
I do love butterflies.

1307
01:08:30,166 --> 01:08:33,433
I might not know as much as you
about the science of everything.

1308
01:08:35,867 --> 01:08:37,567
Okay, I don't know anything
about the science.

1309
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:38,900
But that doesn't matter,

1310
01:08:39,033 --> 01:08:42,000
because I've always loved butterflies.

1311
01:08:42,133 --> 01:08:46,233
My mom was a fabulous gardener.

1312
01:08:46,367 --> 01:08:48,200
And she had a big garden.

1313
01:08:48,333 --> 01:08:52,200
My mom had a nice garden, too.

1314
01:08:52,333 --> 01:08:54,533
And one of my earliest
childhood memories

1315
01:08:54,667 --> 01:08:56,233
was running through
the garden and--

1316
01:08:56,367 --> 01:08:58,900
Chasing the butterflies.

1317
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,400
Well.

1318
01:09:10,033 --> 01:09:12,800
All right.

1319
01:09:12,934 --> 01:09:14,700
Oh, there's just one problem.

1320
01:09:14,834 --> 01:09:18,633
We're going to be about
a hundred caterpillars short.

1321
01:09:20,066 --> 01:09:22,467
I guess we'll have to find the
rest in the wild.

1322
01:09:23,867 --> 01:09:26,600
Um, that's kind of a lot to pick
from random leaves.

1323
01:09:26,734 --> 01:09:29,200
Wait, I-- I think I have
an idea.

1324
01:09:29,333 --> 01:09:31,734
My daughter is doing a school
project on butterflies.

1325
01:09:31,867 --> 01:09:33,567
They found a bunch of milkweed
around the school.

1326
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:36,567
I could talk to the teacher and
see if maybe

1327
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:40,200
she could recruit a few of the
students for a, uh,

1328
01:09:40,333 --> 01:09:42,900
"special assignment."

1329
01:09:43,033 --> 01:09:44,200
That's a great idea.

1330
01:09:44,333 --> 01:09:46,300
Well, cheers.

1331
01:09:46,433 --> 01:09:48,567
You finally came to your senses.

1332
01:09:51,033 --> 01:09:53,900
By the way, um,
are you still single?

1333
01:09:56,934 --> 01:09:58,734
Uh, it's complicated.

1334
01:09:58,867 --> 01:10:03,367
Does anyone know what kind of
animal a butterfly is? Yes.

1335
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:07,767
An insect! And there are 20,000
different species.

1336
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:09,300
Emily:
Very good!

1337
01:10:10,734 --> 01:10:12,133
Yes?

1338
01:10:12,266 --> 01:10:13,567
Are you a professor?

1339
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:16,233
Now, I'm a lepidopterologist.

1340
01:10:16,367 --> 01:10:18,400
What's a lepi-dop-a-gee?

1341
01:10:20,166 --> 01:10:21,633
Someone who studies butterflies.

1342
01:10:21,767 --> 01:10:24,934
That's right. And who can tell
me what a butterfly eats?

1343
01:10:25,066 --> 01:10:27,133
Nectar. Sorry.

1344
01:10:27,266 --> 01:10:30,200
That's right.
Butterflies eat nectar,

1345
01:10:30,333 --> 01:10:32,100
and why is that so important?

1346
01:10:32,233 --> 01:10:35,734
Because that's how butterflies
pollenate flowers and plants.

1347
01:10:35,867 --> 01:10:38,900
You told me to get more interested.

1348
01:10:39,033 --> 01:10:41,934
Now how many of you can tell me,

1349
01:10:42,066 --> 01:10:44,734
besides our friend Mandy here,

1350
01:10:44,867 --> 01:10:46,700
what type of caterpillar
this is?

1351
01:10:46,834 --> 01:10:48,433
Is it a Monarch?

1352
01:10:48,567 --> 01:10:51,233
It is a Monarch, and how would
all of you like to go

1353
01:10:51,367 --> 01:10:54,300
looking for Monarch caterpillars
on a scavenger hunt?!

1354
01:10:56,266 --> 01:10:58,800
Okay, whoever finds the most caterpillars

1355
01:10:58,934 --> 01:11:00,834
gets a home butterfly kit.

1356
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,800
Everybody follow me.

1357
01:11:30,233 --> 01:11:33,600
Mandy: All right, children.
let's go get 'em!

1358
01:11:33,734 --> 01:11:35,300
Good job, kids!

1359
01:11:37,633 --> 01:11:40,433
Be careful! Oh, don't squish it.

1360
01:11:49,767 --> 01:11:51,033
You go!

1361
01:11:57,166 --> 01:11:58,834
Get 'em!

1362
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:12,367
Want a caterpillar?

1363
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:14,367
Uh, no thank you.

1364
01:12:22,567 --> 01:12:24,600
One of the moms just dropped
this off.

1365
01:12:24,734 --> 01:12:26,233
Emily:
Oh, great!

1366
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:29,367
Let's keep them separated until
we know they're healthy.

1367
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:31,433
Should we feel bad about taking
these from the wild?

1368
01:12:31,567 --> 01:12:33,266
I mean, picture it this way.

1369
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:35,333
Half of them would have been
eaten. Nature's not kind.

1370
01:12:35,467 --> 01:12:37,367
Nice.
It's true.

1371
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:39,233
They'll be back in the wild
soon enough.

1372
01:12:39,367 --> 01:12:41,734
Well, how long will this take?

1373
01:12:41,867 --> 01:12:45,400
If we're lucky, about two weeks.

1374
01:12:45,533 --> 01:12:47,367
What do we do now?

1375
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:49,266
We wait.
And hope.

1376
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:51,200
And pray.

1377
01:12:57,233 --> 01:12:59,166
Hi, Jill.

1378
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:01,266
Yeah, uh, just one second.

1379
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:07,233
Hi.

1380
01:13:07,367 --> 01:13:10,467
Great news.
I just spoke to Amy at Breck,

1381
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,166
and Amanda has been accepted!

1382
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:13,467
She has?

1383
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:17,066
Yes! I'm so excited,
and your father is thrilled.

1384
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:20,333
You told him?
Jill: Of course. I told you.

1385
01:13:20,467 --> 01:13:22,467
People can't buy their way into
this school, Garrett.

1386
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,066
This is a pretty big deal.

1387
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:26,233
No, yeah, no... it's...

1388
01:13:26,367 --> 01:13:28,300
It's a big deal.

1389
01:13:28,433 --> 01:13:31,367
It's terrific.
Thank you, Jill.

1390
01:13:44,967 --> 01:13:46,166
Hey.

1391
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:48,600
Hey.

1392
01:13:52,934 --> 01:13:55,000
You okay?

1393
01:13:55,133 --> 01:13:56,433
Yeah.

1394
01:13:57,467 --> 01:13:59,266
Then why don't you seem like it?

1395
01:14:01,667 --> 01:14:03,633
We're moving to New York
next week.

1396
01:14:06,166 --> 01:14:07,300
Oh.

1397
01:14:07,433 --> 01:14:10,567
This doesn't come without
mixed emotions.

1398
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:13,233
I just, I have to think
about Amanda.

1399
01:14:13,367 --> 01:14:15,233
You know, I have to put her
needs first.

1400
01:14:15,367 --> 01:14:18,433
Amanda will be happy
wherever she is,

1401
01:14:18,567 --> 01:14:20,066
as long as she's with you.

1402
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:24,867
It's a good school she got in.
You know, it's one of the best.

1403
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,467
And she's got all the history
with Jill...

1404
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,467
It's the right decision.

1405
01:14:31,567 --> 01:14:32,800
You sure?

1406
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:35,900
Yeah.

1407
01:14:41,767 --> 01:14:44,934
Listen, I won't be able to be
there for the wedding.

1408
01:14:45,066 --> 01:14:46,967
But I'd like to help out,

1409
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:49,066
do anything I can before
I leave.

1410
01:14:50,934 --> 01:14:52,533
I'd like that.

1411
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:38,500
Daddy, look!

1412
01:15:38,633 --> 01:15:40,066
I see it!

1413
01:15:42,667 --> 01:15:44,333
I named her after Mommy.

1414
01:15:44,467 --> 01:15:46,333
I remember.

1415
01:15:46,467 --> 01:15:48,166
Sarah the butterfly.

1416
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:50,800
Amanda:
Yeah.

1417
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,367
No matter how many times
I see it,

1418
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:04,700
it's still a wonder.

1419
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:10,533
I can't believe we pulled this off.

1420
01:16:10,667 --> 01:16:11,767
Mandy:
I can't either.

1421
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:14,667
That was insane,
and this is lovely.

1422
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,734
To our new friendship.

1423
01:16:16,867 --> 01:16:19,867
And partnership.

1424
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,567
Really? After everything?

1425
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:24,066
Why not?

1426
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:26,433
You are like the perfect person.

1427
01:16:26,567 --> 01:16:28,834
It's so annoying.

1428
01:16:30,367 --> 01:16:32,600
I'll drink to that.

1429
01:16:32,734 --> 01:16:36,734
Well, here's to 1,501 butterflies.

1430
01:16:36,867 --> 01:16:38,867
Cheers!
Cheers!

1431
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
I couldn't have done this
without you guys.

1432
01:16:41,133 --> 01:16:42,934
Well, don't forget me.

1433
01:16:43,066 --> 01:16:44,533
I mean, you couldn't have
done it without me

1434
01:16:44,667 --> 01:16:46,500
and my amazing skills with
a hammer and nails.

1435
01:16:46,633 --> 01:16:48,834
Yeah, you mean the one that
bashed your thumb?

1436
01:16:48,967 --> 01:16:50,200
Ouch.

1437
01:16:51,667 --> 01:16:53,834
Seriously, though.
This was a lot of fun,

1438
01:16:53,967 --> 01:16:58,266
so thank you for including
Amanda, and me.

1439
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,066
Thank you.

1440
01:17:08,433 --> 01:17:10,166
You are so welcome sweetie.

1441
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:12,734
You come back and visit me
anytime, okay?

1442
01:17:12,867 --> 01:17:15,233
I will. I'll miss you.

1443
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:20,467
Larry: You've gotta try one of
these burgers.

1444
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:23,600
Oh, um,
I'm-- I'm stuffed.

1445
01:17:23,734 --> 01:17:25,767
Nonsense.
I'm taking a grilling class.

1446
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:27,166
The cheese on the inside
of the burgers,

1447
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:28,800
it melted when
I charbroiled them.

1448
01:17:28,934 --> 01:17:30,066
They're fantastic.

1449
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:31,667
Uh, I'll take two.
Ah!

1450
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:33,967
Don't encourage him.

1451
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:35,233
There you are, good man.

1452
01:17:37,233 --> 01:17:40,200
Oh, um... Our car is here.

1453
01:17:42,133 --> 01:17:43,600
What happened to your SUV?

1454
01:17:43,734 --> 01:17:45,333
I sold it.

1455
01:17:46,734 --> 01:17:49,867
This all happened so fast.
Safe trip.

1456
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:52,266
Thanks.

1457
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:53,834
Bye, Garrett.

1458
01:17:53,967 --> 01:17:56,066
See you.

1459
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:58,333
Larry, how about I try
those burgers

1460
01:17:58,467 --> 01:17:59,800
next time I'm back in town?

1461
01:17:59,934 --> 01:18:01,467
You do that.

1462
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:02,967
You take care, son.

1463
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:05,033
Garrett:
Thanks. You too.

1464
01:18:05,166 --> 01:18:07,367
I'll walk you guys out.

1465
01:18:19,133 --> 01:18:20,700
Well, good luck at the wedding.

1466
01:18:20,834 --> 01:18:22,700
Thank you.

1467
01:18:22,834 --> 01:18:25,166
You know, I really wish that
I could be there.

1468
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:27,166
I get it.

1469
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:31,900
I'm really gonna miss you.

1470
01:18:32,033 --> 01:18:34,567
I'll miss you too, sweetheart.

1471
01:18:46,633 --> 01:18:49,367
Well, take care of yourself.

1472
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:51,400
Yeah. You too.

1473
01:18:57,433 --> 01:18:59,000
You okay?

1474
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:03,667
I'm fine.

1475
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:09,600
I feel-- I feel bad about this.

1476
01:19:09,734 --> 01:19:12,133
I just feel like the timing
was off.

1477
01:19:14,433 --> 01:19:16,633
Don't feel bad.

1478
01:19:16,767 --> 01:19:19,367
And the timing was really good.

1479
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:22,066
I feel great.

1480
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:25,800
And I haven't felt great
in a really long while, so...

1481
01:19:27,834 --> 01:19:30,700
Well, I'm happy to hear that.

1482
01:19:33,934 --> 01:19:36,300
You know, I, uh...

1483
01:19:36,433 --> 01:19:39,066
I kinda wish Amanda was born
a month earlier.

1484
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:41,700
That way we could have
spent a bit more time together.

1485
01:19:41,834 --> 01:19:44,266
That would have been May 10th?

1486
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,367
Nah, we were booked up
that day.

1487
01:19:48,367 --> 01:19:50,266
Well, I guess we never would
have met, then.

1488
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,367
It's funny how the world
works things out.

1489
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:55,166
Yeah.

1490
01:20:26,433 --> 01:20:28,400
Hello? Oh.

1491
01:20:31,667 --> 01:20:34,734
Sweetie, don't you think
it's time that we let Sarah go?

1492
01:20:34,867 --> 01:20:37,233
Not yet! Emily said I could keep
her for a week.

1493
01:20:37,367 --> 01:20:40,033
Well, why don't you bring her
and your suitcase

1494
01:20:40,166 --> 01:20:42,233
over to the car?
I'll meet you over there.

1495
01:20:42,367 --> 01:20:43,734
Okay.

1496
01:20:45,667 --> 01:20:46,867
Is that everything?

1497
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,200
Yeah.

1498
01:20:49,667 --> 01:20:51,600
It's funny, I feel like I'm
forgetting something.

1499
01:20:51,734 --> 01:20:53,100
We'll have it shipped.

1500
01:20:53,233 --> 01:20:55,400
Come on, we're gonna miss
the flight.

1501
01:20:55,533 --> 01:20:57,266
So I got an interesting call.

1502
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:59,066
Oh yeah? About what?

1503
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:00,967
Well, the Bureau Chief
in Barcelona.

1504
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:03,900
I'm not taking it, of course,
but it was interesting.

1505
01:21:11,934 --> 01:21:14,100
From this moment forward,

1506
01:21:14,233 --> 01:21:16,100
you will never be alone.

1507
01:21:16,233 --> 01:21:19,367
You will carry with you the love
of another person

1508
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:23,834
giving you a completeness and
renewed likeness.

1509
01:21:23,967 --> 01:21:26,467
May your life together be
immersed in love...

1510
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:28,033
How much longer?

1511
01:21:28,166 --> 01:21:31,834
Well, according to Rebecca's
itinerary, 18 seconds.

1512
01:21:31,967 --> 01:21:34,100
You have given
and received a ring

1513
01:21:34,233 --> 01:21:36,867
as a symbol of your promises.
By the power...

1514
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,900
Okay, everybody.
Get ready.

1515
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:42,367
Okay, now.

1516
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:44,133
Okay, now!

1517
01:21:44,266 --> 01:21:47,433
Pastor: I pronounce you
husband and wife.

1518
01:22:14,033 --> 01:22:18,033
Family and friends,
over 1,500 butterflies

1519
01:22:18,166 --> 01:22:19,934
released into the wild.

1520
01:22:30,233 --> 01:22:31,533
You okay?

1521
01:22:31,667 --> 01:22:33,633
Yeah. We did it.

1522
01:22:34,900 --> 01:22:36,700
That's not what I meant.

1523
01:22:38,133 --> 01:22:40,934
Honestly,
I've never felt better.

1524
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:47,000
How about now?

1525
01:22:52,734 --> 01:22:55,100
What?

1526
01:22:55,233 --> 01:22:56,900
Emily!

1527
01:22:57,033 --> 01:22:58,500
Amanda!

1528
01:23:01,033 --> 01:23:03,233
We forgot we have to let her go
with the others.

1529
01:23:03,367 --> 01:23:06,333
Oh my gosh, you're right!
She's our 1,501.

1530
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:09,300
What are you...

1531
01:23:09,433 --> 01:23:12,834
We had a record to break,
didn't we?

1532
01:23:12,967 --> 01:23:15,233
Okay, sweetie,
time to let Sarah go.

1533
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:39,467
Well, congratulations
on the record.

1534
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:40,800
Hi.

1535
01:23:40,934 --> 01:23:42,367
Hi.

1536
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:44,767
What happened?

1537
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:48,567
Amanda's heart is here.

1538
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:50,667
And I realized that mine is too.

1539
01:23:54,266 --> 01:23:56,133
So you're staying?

1540
01:23:56,266 --> 01:23:58,300
Well, I mean, somebody has to
expand that Flight House

1541
01:23:58,433 --> 01:24:00,400
now that you've hit
the big time.

1542
01:24:02,433 --> 01:24:04,633
And I want to be with you.

1543
01:24:20,700 --> 01:24:23,400
Funny how the world
works things out.

1544
01:24:23,533 --> 01:24:26,934
Well, I guess it's not
so complicated after all.
