LAW SOCIETY

00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:25,791
MOBILITY INCLUSION CARD

5
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:27,208
That's it, my darling.

6
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:29,333
That's a handicapped spot!

7
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:31,250
I know, I park here every day.

8
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:32,333
That's not right!

9
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:38,125
Nobody disabled is around.

10
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:40,875
But your "darling" crapping
on the sidewalk

11
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:43,000
is a Class 1 infraction.

12
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:46,208
This is for the cops. Have a nice day.

13
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:07,250
-You're late.
-Because of an old lady.

14
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:09,666
The Big Boss started the meeting.

15
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,375
You're three minutes late.

16
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,500
Yes? Ah, Charlie.

17
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:20,875
Sorry, I was helping an old lady.

18
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:22,875
Fine. You were saying, Bertrand?

19
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,041
I was saying we can't work miracles,

20
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:27,625
nothing in the case file helps our client.

21
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:30,625
He raped her, that's it.
He'll get the maximum sentence.

22
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:32,458
So, what have you prepared?

23
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:35,916
Well, I'll say the only thing
there is to say. That he's sorry.

24
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:39,250
What do you think, Charlie?

25
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:44,125
Well, I don't know anything
about the case.

26
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:46,708
-It doesn't look good for us, but...
-But what?

27
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:50,541
It's rare to find nothing in a case file.

28
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:54,000
Excellent. Will you look it over
with Bertrand?

29
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:57,208
I'm very sorry, but I don't have the time.

30
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,250
Excuse me? I didn't get that.

31
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,041
-I'll have a look.
-Good.

32
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:03,000
-When is the trial?
-Tomorrow.

33
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,625
If you have a good horse, you make it run.

34
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:08,583
So, Frédérique, your turn.
The Mercier case...

35
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:13,416
The boss asked me to give you the summons.

36
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,250
He wants you instead of Bertrand.

37
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,458
So now he wants me to try the case?

38
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:21,041
The Bobigny courthouse?

39
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:22,625
That's out of town.

40
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:25,416
Charlie! Bobigny, tomorrow, 9:00 a.m.

41
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,708
Yes.

42
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,583
Found anything for the case?

43
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,958
No, but I have all night!

44
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:33,250
Don't forget dinner at your mother's.

45
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:37,375
She gets on my nerves.

46
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,416
You're tough. Your mother's nice.

47
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:41,333
Want her? You can have her.

48
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,416
You're kidding me!

49
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:03,791
This place is falling apart!

50
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:06,041
No, it's just the lightbulb.

51
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,958
This house is indestructible.

52
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:09,458
Your grandfather built it.

53
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:10,958
Of course, look.

54
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,791
No! Don't damage your inheritance.

55
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,541
Mom, I don't want the house,

56
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,083
I just want some light.

57
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,541
Anyway, you work too much.

58
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,333
-Here we go.
-If you worked less,

59
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,750
you might have time to start a family.

60
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,125
No, thanks!

61
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,750
Living alone isn't living.

62
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,291
Whose fault is that? You left Dad.

63
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:31,541
He was a real man.

64
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,541
Your father, may he rest in peace,
had his faults.

65
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:39,250
That's right! Tall, handsome, died a hero.

66
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:42,416
Well, come on, let's eat!

67
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,583
What are you working on?

68
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,250
A case I'm trying
tomorrow morning in Bobigny.

69
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,416
Bobigny? Ah, Bobigny.

70
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,500
I marched there in 1972

71
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:02,375
for abortion rights.

72
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,416
It's ready.

73
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,166
It was for the trial
of Marie-Claire Chevalier,

74
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:11,500
a 16-year-old girl who had had
an illegal abortion after being raped.

75
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,125
Her rapist reported it to the police

76
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,000
to get a reduced sentence.

77
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:18,250
Gisèle Halimi tried the case.

78
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:21,875
There were so many people
we couldn't get into the courtroom.

79
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,916
I'm so proud you'll be there.

80
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,291
Charlie? Charlie?

81
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,125
It's 7:30, you're listening to RFM.

82
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,666
It's March 8. No, it's not Groundhog Day,

83
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,541
it's International Women's Day,
so, ladies, enjoy.

84
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,041
-It's Bertrand!
-I'm here.

85
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,500
You can't miss me, I'm...

86
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm on the blue bridge!

87
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,416
So, did you find anything?

88
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,083
Of course.

89
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,625
-Marie-Claire!
-Who?

90
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:54,208
-Marie-Claire Chevalier?
-No.

91
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,208
The trial in Bobigny in 1972?

92
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:58,875
Sure you're a lawyer?

93
00:05:58,958 --> 00:05:59,958
Yeah...

94
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:02,375
He's guilty. What are you going to say?

95
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:03,791
-Morning.
-Huh?

96
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,291
You found something?

97
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,416
Can you tell me what you found?

98
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,333
-I have to pee.
-Right.

99
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:11,375
-Here.
-Good.

100
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:15,000
That's a good idea. I have to, too.
Pee, I mean.

101
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,250
-Sorry, it's an emergency.
-Seriously?

102
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:35,875
Who are those people?

103
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:38,125
-The press.
-Court is in session, be seated.

104
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:42,750
We'll proceed with drawing jurors.
Juror 15.

105
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,333
Miss Axelle Schneider.

106
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:48,541
Juror 12. Mr. Daniel Roskis.

107
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,750
Juror 12, come take a seat.

108
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:58,625
Juror 14, Mrs. Mauricette Sainte-Rose.

109
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,083
My client is a victim of a crime.

110
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,500
A horrible crime

111
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:09,458
-that must be punished.
-I'll tear her to pieces.

112
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,791
A crime that, today,
in the post-MeToo era,

113
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:14,583
we can no longer let go unpunished.

114
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:17,708
Fear must finally switch sides.

115
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,791
It's your responsibility

116
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:23,750
to make sure this predator
can't hurt anyone anymore,

117
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,166
which is why

118
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,833
I'm calling for 15 years imprisonment

119
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,041
-for this dangerous individual.
-It's good.

120
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:33,000
Today is International Women's Day.

121
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,458
Because women have rights.

122
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:36,875
Everyone knows this.

123
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,458
But men have rights, too.

124
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,750
And people tend to forget that these days.

125
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:45,666
Particularly, the right to have
consensual sex with a woman

126
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,958
without the risk of spending
15 years in prison

127
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:52,541
just because the woman regrets
having done it.

128
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,916
This woman maintains
my client forced himself on her,

129
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,375
but that's a lie! She's lying.

130
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:01,041
And I have proof of this lie in my file.

131
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,333
This woman knew him.

132
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,166
They had a date,

133
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,416
and this young woman showed up wearing

134
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,833
sexy underwear.

135
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,541
She even stated to the police,

136
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:17,125
quote, "that she was wearing
a red lace thong."

137
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,708
Like this one.

138
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,708
When a woman wears a red lace thong,

139
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:28,583
it's because she hopes
a man will find it, see it,

140
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,500
and take it off.

141
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,041
There was clearly no rape.

142
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:37,750
The was a consensual sexual relation.

143
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:39,958
And this thong

144
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,750
is proof of that consent.

145
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:51,333
Right now, I'm wearing cotton panties.

146
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,416
Do you know why?

147
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,125
Because this morning, when I got dressed,

148
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,166
I knew I didn't have a date.

149
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:03,875
I knew I was coming here
to the Bobigny courthouse.

150
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:06,916
That's why I'm not wearing this.

151
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,750
And I'm sure you're not, either, ladies.

152
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,833
This is why

153
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:19,583
I ask that you acquit this innocent man.

154
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,083
Don't worry, we'll appeal.

155
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,041
Charlie, how could you do that?

156
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,666
It's unworthy of a lawyer,

157
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,291
woman or man.

158
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:29,291
A lawyer must be able to defend anyone.

159
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,166
Yes, but not however you like!

160
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,583
The thong-consent defense
is a return to the Middle Ages.

161
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,875
-That's not the funniest part.
-What?

162
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,625
I'm not wearing cotton panties.

163
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,208
I'm wearing a thong.

164
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,416
Red lace.

165
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,708
THE "THONG" AFFAIR

166
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:48,291
A bizarre acquittal
is causing some anger...

167
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:51,500
...from the people of France
to the National Assembly.

168
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:54,000
It may be embarrassing to brandish
a thong here.

169
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:54,958
THE THONG OF CONSENT

170
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:58,791
How does a rape victim feel
having their underwear displayed in court?

171
00:09:58,875 --> 00:09:59,875
THE THONG AFFAIR: FRANCE ANGRY

172
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,750
An incredible ruling

173
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:04,541
that will have consequences for future...

174
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:07,833
...rape victims.
Wearing a thong will be...

175
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:11,208
...from now on, considered
consent for sexual relations.

176
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,375
Here's our report.

177
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,250
Are the shots for you?

178
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,958
Drinking to forget my victory?

179
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,291
I wouldn't call that a victory.

180
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,708
You're jealous, I get it.

181
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:39,166
It's your case, but I'm the one on TV.

182
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,541
Do you realize what you've done?

183
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,458
You created a legal precedent.

184
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,416
Look, I did my job.
I defended my client. Period.

185
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,416
-The consequences are not my problem.
-Sure.

186
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,208
-Shots!
-Charlie!

187
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,125
-Hey, Noémie!
-Here I am!

188
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,583
Where's the guy from the other night?

189
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,375
Is he next?

190
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:02,916
-Hey, maybe!
-What?

191
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,625
To thank me for getting
his client off the hook.

192
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,083
I saw what you did on TV!

193
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,958
Bravo, another bastard goes free
thanks to you.

194
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,500
-Let's celebrate!
-No, no.

195
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:13,958
Come on, nothing heavy.

196
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,333
No, I need to behave.

197
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:18,208
It's almost therapeutic.
Come on! Trust me!

198
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:20,500
Come on!

199
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:22,583
Okay.

200
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,291
All right...

201
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:35,000
Okay. Besides...

202
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,791
We're all gonna die!

203
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:54,375
PRINCESS STREET

204
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,958
I'll be there in five minutes.
I just left Castel.

205
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,291
Sorry, it's an emergency.

206
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,250
That's my taxi!

207
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,458
-But this is my day!
-What?

208
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,250
We have one day a year,
best take advantage of it.

209
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,750
-Where to?
-17B quai de Conti.

210
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,916
Hey, I know you! You were on the news.

211
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,583
You're the lawyer who tries cases
against women.

212
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,083
That's me.

213
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,125
And you are...

214
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,458
TAXI DRIVER
IDENTIFICATION CARD

215
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:28,333
Hubert, the taxi driver.

216
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,708
You must love danger.

217
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,625
Taxi drivers make safer enemies
than women.

218
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,541
Yeah, I'm so sick of their #MeToo.

219
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:38,333
Well, there's still a lot of inequality.

220
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,416
Did you know only 2% of streets
are named after women?

221
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,625
Fascinating.

222
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,833
Guess which name is the most common.

223
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,375
What do you think?

224
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,791
A man. General de Gaulle!

225
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:55,625
With 3,903 streets and an airport.

226
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,791
Is this Cash Cab Wikipedia?

227
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:58,916
And for women?

228
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,166
Who has the most streets named after her?

229
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,500
-Don't care.
-No, Marie Curie,

230
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,041
with 999 streets.

231
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,708
Followed by Joan of Arc, then George Sand.

232
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:12,166
But only because people think she's a man.

233
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,458
Guess how many streets Joan of Arc has.

234
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:17,000
672.

235
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,666
She still got burned alive.

236
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,708
Know why she was burned alive?

237
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:24,208
Because she was crazy and heard voices.

238
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,750
No, that's what the books say.

239
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:29,125
-But I know the real story.
-Excuse me.

240
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:33,083
Could you just drive and...

241
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,458
Okay.

242
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:45,833
So...

243
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,958
It was because she wore pants.

244
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,083
Who cares about your history lesson?

245
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,500
Stop, we're here.

246
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,250
Those who forget the past
are condemned to relive it.

247
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,083
No, Winston Churchill.

248
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:20,166
Shit! You little shit!

249
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:49,500
My Louboutins!

250
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,541
What the hell am I doing here?

251
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:55,666
This is shit!

252
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,791
Stay away, pig!

253
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,250
What is it, pig?

254
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,458
Human!

255
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,416
The devil's in the pigpen!

256
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,708
Sir!

257
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,583
-Come back, please.
-The devil!

258
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:20,125
Devil's in the pigpen!

259
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,750
Nice piggy.

260
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,583
Nice piggy. Don't move. Sir?

261
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:26,708
Sir...

262
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:29,833
Sir?

263
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,166
Come back!

264
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,416
Don't move, piggy!

265
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,375
Help, anyone!

266
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,000
There it is! There!

267
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,083
Finally! Why did you lock me in?

268
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,916
You're under arrest, witch!

269
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,333
What the hell is this, Medieval Times?

270
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,708
Great costumes, guys!

271
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:52,958
-Move!
-What are you doing?

272
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,041
Harlot from hell!

273
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,250
Okay, I'm high.

274
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,541
You're cops, and I'm hallucinating.

275
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,541
Sorry, I'm not laughing at you.

276
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm a lawyer, I know the procedure.

277
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,541
I'm in the drunk tank.

278
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:10,333
Yes, okay,
I took some therapeutic substances.

279
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,291
Silence, nasty woman!

280
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,208
Okay!

281
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,458
Therapeutic substances, my ass!

282
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,000
This isn't therapeutic.

283
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,750
-Explain that to Monseigneur Cauchon.
-Who?

284
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,750
We're all gonna die!

285
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,916
Noémie? Is that you?

286
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
-Did they arrest you too?
-Yes.

287
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,916
I'm Noémie! That's me!

288
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,750
If you could see your face!

289
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:35,375
What's with these hallucinations?

290
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,166
-What was in those pills?
-Pills?

291
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,125
Disrobe, witches!

292
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,541
-Come on!
-No!

293
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,875
Move it, I said!

294
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,833
-Faster!
-We're getting undressed?

295
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,541
Fine, let's get undressed.

296
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:46,833
Faster!

297
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,250
-Come on!
-Here we go.

298
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,958
-Move it!
-Everyone get naked!

299
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,791
Line up! Come here.

300
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,583
Move it!

301
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:57,791
Bishop Cauchon will check
if you bear the mark of the devil.

302
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,333
-You!
-Come here.

303
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:02,500
Not me!

304
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:06,500
Yeah, right. Cauchon just wants to ogle
the women's sexy underwear.

305
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:07,791
Or not.

306
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,666
Move it!

307
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,375
-You.
-Come.

308
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,458
Move it!

309
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,541
Not you.

310
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,666
Thank you, Your Lordship! Thank you!

311
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,791
Wait for me outside.

312
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:33,875
Move it!

313
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:38,375
What a pig!
I bet he's the one who ate my Louboutins.

314
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,416
-Move it!
-I'm scared!

315
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,541
Don't worry, it's just a medical check

316
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,583
before they lock us up. It's nothing.

317
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,958
-Move it!
-You.

318
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,708
No, I don't want to!

319
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,000
Noémie? Are you okay?

320
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:55,333
Move it!

321
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,416
The clothes of the devil!

322
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,250
No, they're Victoria's Secret.

323
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,208
Put your clothes on, witch!

324
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,750
-Okay, fine!
-Come on, move it.

325
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,000
-You.
-Let's go.

326
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,625
It smells like shit!

327
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,250
Faster!

328
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,000
Hurry up!

329
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:17,791
Move it!

330
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:20,708
This is itchy!

331
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:23,791
Is this burlap?
Sustainable clothing sucks!

332
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,083
So that's...

333
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,208
the van. Okay.

334
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:34,791
So, gentlemen, if it's possible,
I'd like to go feet-first.

335
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,500
Thank you, gentlemen.

336
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:38,708
Noémie! Are you okay?

337
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,041
Souvenir!

338
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,625
For posterity, my dear!

339
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,333
-These aren't my clothes!
-Shut up!

340
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:50,708
These aren't my--

341
00:18:58,166 --> 00:18:59,625
These aren't my clothes!

342
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,583
Go!

343
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,083
These aren't my clothes!

344
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,125
These...

345
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,166
are not...

346
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,125
my... clothes!

347
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:26,916
This is ridiculous.

348
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,958
There's no point in fighting the cops,
you'll just make it worse.

349
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,708
I'm fighting injustice.

350
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,166
Well...

351
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,208
it looks really effective!

352
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,250
That's Rouen.

353
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:49,916
Oh, so pretty!

354
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,750
-That's nice!
-Daughter of Satan!

355
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,125
-Witches!
-Burn in hell!

356
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,208
Hedonists!

357
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:58,541
Burn them!

358
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,375
Are the dentists on strike in Rouen?

359
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:07,625
This is poo!

360
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:16,416
Okay, an immediate trial, girls.
If we confess, we'll be okay.

361
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,583
-What is your name?
-My name is...

362
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,333
My name is...

363
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,208
-Noémie!
-Noémie!

364
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,416
I confess.

365
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,000
I confess.

366
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:37,000
You confess to being a witch.
You shall be burned alive.

367
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:38,458
-Burned alive?
-Thank you.

368
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:39,916
-Burned alive?
-Thank you!

369
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,416
Did he say, "burned alive"?

370
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:44,958
These drugs are strong!

371
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,125
Next!

372
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:50,833
Joan of Arc.

373
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,250
Joan of Arc?

374
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:54,666
It's Joan of Arc!

375
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,541
Do you really believe
you are in a state of grace?

376
00:20:57,625 --> 00:21:01,541
If I am not, may God put me in it.
If I am, may He keep me in it.

377
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,000
Why do you dress as a man?

378
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,500
To drive the English out of France.

379
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,541
You'll agree it's more practical.

380
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,500
It's against nature.

381
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,958
You're a man and you're wearing a robe.

382
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:22,416
But there are no English
to drive out here.

383
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,416
That's why I was wearing a dress,

384
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:25,916
but it was stolen.

385
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,833
Oh? Who stole it?

386
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:31,666
I imagine it was the English, to trap me.

387
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,083
Do you think God loves the English?

388
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,625
Yes, but in their homeland.

389
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,166
It was the English who branded

390
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,666
these clothes with the mark of the devil.

391
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:46,125
Levi's!

392
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,583
The mark of the devil!

393
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,750
No, it's just a jeans brand.

394
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,041
Enough!

395
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:56,666
Joan,

396
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:02,000
you have chosen to present yourself

397
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:04,125
with all the bearings of a man.

398
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:06,708
Pants, short hair...

399
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:08,166
And freedom of speech.

400
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:14,791
You shall therefore be burned alive
for heresy.

401
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:15,833
Guards!

402
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:18,750
Seize this virgin transvestite soldier!

403
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:22,666
Here we go. She never listens!

404
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,708
You're going to get tased

405
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:27,583
and face other charges
for contempt of court.

406
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:28,500
Next!

407
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,000
Your Honor, gentlemen.

408
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:34,916
-What is your name?
-Leroy, Charlie.

409
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,708
-You believe you're King Charles?
-Uh, no.

410
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:39,166
I was at Castel...

411
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,791
The castle of which lord?

412
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:43,166
-On Princess Street.
-What princess?

413
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,208
In the 6th Arrondissement.
Anyway, Your Honor, I confess.

414
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:48,208
Yes, I committed a crime.

415
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:49,833
I took some drugs.

416
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:53,166
I don't know which ones,
but they were really strong.

417
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:56,583
Sorry, but if you could see what I see.
The looks on your faces!

418
00:22:56,666 --> 00:23:01,333
She was arrested wearing men's clothes.

419
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:02,458
Blasphemy!

420
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:05,791
The main charge is heresy.

421
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,541
No, heresy is for Joan of Arc.

422
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:11,833
For me, it's the consumption of narcotics.

423
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:13,041
Bishop Cauchon,

424
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:17,166
we notice that she's on the right path

425
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,791
for she appears before us
in women's clothes.

426
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:20,916
That's right, man.

427
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:23,958
Yes...

428
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:28,916
but under her women's clothes,

429
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,166
she's wearing undergarments

430
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:36,791
as red as hell.

431
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,000
I therefore ask

432
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:42,208
that she undergo a trial by water.

433
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:46,375
So be it. Take her to the bridge!

434
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:49,333
The bridge? What bridge?

435
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:52,500
-Next!
-What's this about a bridge?

436
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:54,000
Is it the Bridge of Avignon?

437
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,000
What is your name?

438
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:01,125
Feet and hands tied? Seriously?

439
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:02,458
Throw her in!

440
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:05,791
Luckily none of this is real.

441
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:08,166
Because this is really high, guys.

442
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:11,041
-The toes of Satan!
-Throw her in!

443
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,875
This is real!

444
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:24,250
If she drowns, she's not a witch.

445
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:25,875
I hope she doesn't drown.

446
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:28,833
That way we can burn her alive.

447
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:30,416
She's not coming back up!

448
00:24:31,916 --> 00:24:34,333
-Another innocent woman!
-Fifth one this week.

449
00:24:50,125 --> 00:24:52,583
Who are you? What are you doing here?

450
00:24:52,666 --> 00:24:55,166
Who are you? What am I doing here?

451
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:58,333
François Blanchard, bank manager.
You're in my office.

452
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:01,625
Thank God, the nightmare is over.

453
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,166
She peed on my carpet!

454
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,958
Oh, no, it's the river...

455
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:06,625
Look, I just want to go home.

456
00:25:06,708 --> 00:25:09,208
Fine with me. Get out. Out!

457
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:12,333
My phone, I lost it in the water.

458
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:15,166
Could you call me a taxi?

459
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,541
Also, I'd like to withdraw some cash.

460
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,875
Here's my card. Thanks.

461
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:24,416
To withdraw money
from your husband's account,

462
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,250
I need your husband's permission,
not this... thing.

463
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:29,208
What? No, from my account.

464
00:25:29,291 --> 00:25:30,250
Your account?

465
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:34,375
Your husband let you
open an account in your name?

466
00:25:34,458 --> 00:25:38,000
What's wrong with you?
You sound like my mom.

467
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,375
I'm a lawyer, okay?

468
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:43,291
I work. I have more in my account
than your crappy little bank.

469
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,708
So, give me 200 euros.

470
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:48,625
-200 what?
-200 euros!

471
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:50,750
Is this a joke?

472
00:25:50,833 --> 00:25:52,083
Okay, I get it,

473
00:25:52,166 --> 00:25:54,666
there's a hidden camera, right?
Let me tell you,

474
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:57,916
I don't find this funny at all!

475
00:25:58,375 --> 00:25:59,375
Gérard!

476
00:26:08,375 --> 00:26:09,291
Well!

477
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:12,125
I'll tell you what!

478
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:16,041
I'm going to send a strongly-worded email
to your management!

479
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,208
CREDIT BANK - BCE

480
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,166
A bum, stay away!

481
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:40,625
Mom? Dad?

482
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:45,000
Dad?

483
00:26:45,958 --> 00:26:48,458
Dad! Dad!

484
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,583
How can I help you?

485
00:26:50,666 --> 00:26:52,666
As you know, we're newlyweds...

486
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,625
You want to open an account for her?

487
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:57,750
No, I was thinking of a simple checkbook
on my account.

488
00:26:57,833 --> 00:27:00,041
You're right. Women can't manage money.

489
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:01,250
You'll retain control.

490
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:04,250
Come into my office,
you'll be more comfortable.

491
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:05,875
-Dad!
-Gérard!

492
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:13,833
This isn't possible.

493
00:27:14,583 --> 00:27:16,125
Dad is dead.

494
00:27:17,791 --> 00:27:19,625
And this isn't real.

495
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,500
It's real!

496
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:23,500
You're crazy!

497
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:26,750
That's it, I'm crazy.
This is all in my head.

498
00:27:37,208 --> 00:27:39,625
Hello! Where to?

499
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:42,333
You? I know you!

500
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:44,625
You're Hubert!

501
00:27:44,708 --> 00:27:46,541
Yes, that's me. How are you?

502
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:48,291
Not good at all!

503
00:27:48,916 --> 00:27:51,208
The drugs, the cart, the drowning,

504
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:52,875
-and Dad...
-Breathe!

505
00:27:52,958 --> 00:27:56,166
And all this! The banker who wouldn't...

506
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,791
Breathe! It's normal.

507
00:27:58,875 --> 00:28:02,916
You can't open a bank account or even work
without your husband's permission.

508
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,416
Because you're a woman in 1964.

509
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,416
'64?

510
00:28:08,291 --> 00:28:10,208
What the hell am I doing in '64?

511
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:11,375
That's up to you.

512
00:28:11,458 --> 00:28:14,166
Look, sir, I just want to go home.

513
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,416
Not yet.

514
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,125
How long will this madness go on?

515
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:20,000
Some get it quickly, others...

516
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,875
You could take a while.

517
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:25,291
I have cases, clients.
I don't have time for this!

518
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:26,875
You don't have a choice.

519
00:28:26,958 --> 00:28:28,791
Okay, how much do you want?

520
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:31,000
-I have money!
-Not anymore.

521
00:28:31,916 --> 00:28:32,833
Get in the car.

522
00:28:32,916 --> 00:28:34,500
Who are you?

523
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:36,625
Why are you doing this to me?

524
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:40,375
-Get in.
-Did I free your mother's killer?

525
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:42,708
-Get in.
-Okay.

526
00:28:46,708 --> 00:28:48,125
I'm a lawyer

527
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:49,916
just doing my job.

528
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:53,750
What is this, voodoo?

529
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:56,250
I couldn't let you get my seats all wet.

530
00:28:58,208 --> 00:28:59,625
What a nightmare!

531
00:28:59,708 --> 00:29:01,083
No, just a journey.

532
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:02,666
Journey? To where?

533
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:05,166
Buckle up, here we go!

534
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:09,416
Oh, right. No seatbelts in '64.

535
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:14,916
My head.

536
00:29:18,041 --> 00:29:19,000
I'm home!

537
00:29:23,541 --> 00:29:25,083
No, I'm not home!

538
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:27,333
What do you want?

539
00:29:42,833 --> 00:29:44,666
Thank you, sir! Very much.

540
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:46,125
For intervening.

541
00:29:47,958 --> 00:29:50,125
But I'd rather you not come near me.

542
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:52,875
Don't come near me, I'm warning you!
I'll scream!

543
00:30:14,958 --> 00:30:17,000
No, she wear...

544
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:18,458
pants.

545
00:30:20,666 --> 00:30:22,333
Let me go!

546
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,458
What the hell is this?

547
00:30:31,666 --> 00:30:34,958
No worthless cab driver
will decide what I do!

548
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:38,833
Okay. This all started
with a night out drinking.

549
00:30:39,625 --> 00:30:43,208
So, I'll just do it again
and wake up at home.

550
00:30:43,291 --> 00:30:44,625
I need some alcohol!

551
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:46,625
And...

552
00:30:47,208 --> 00:30:49,291
What? What now?

553
00:30:58,916 --> 00:31:00,750
What? Why are you arresting me?

554
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,041
For illegally wearing... pants.

555
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:09,458
Again? We already did this.

556
00:31:09,916 --> 00:31:11,541
This isn't the Middle Ages.

557
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:14,125
Let me go!

558
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:17,041
Next!

559
00:31:17,791 --> 00:31:20,500
-I want to leave!
-It's for a refill.

560
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:23,000
Here's my doctor's note.

561
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,333
Let me go, I need to drink alcohol!

562
00:31:28,416 --> 00:31:30,458
As soon as someone brings you a dress.

563
00:31:30,541 --> 00:31:32,833
-I don't know anyone!
-In all of Paris?

564
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:34,875
No, in this whole era.

565
00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:39,916
-Come on, be nice.
-Next!

566
00:31:40,833 --> 00:31:42,333
I'm going to die here.

567
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:46,875
She had the same mustache!

568
00:31:54,125 --> 00:31:55,791
You! You may leave.

569
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,250
Just like that?

570
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:01,458
Without being burned at the stake?

571
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:05,208
Someone brought a doctor's note
authorizing your cross-dressing.

572
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:06,333
-What?
-Go on.

573
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,416
Go!

574
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:11,750
"Authorizing Miss Charlie Leroy

575
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:15,166
"to dress as a man for her health!

576
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:18,541
"Paris, April 6, 1850."

577
00:32:19,791 --> 00:32:21,291
Where are you, Hubert?

578
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:23,458
I know this permit is from you!

579
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:25,041
No, it was me.

580
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,708
Oh, thank you.

581
00:32:27,291 --> 00:32:28,208
You're welcome.

582
00:32:28,958 --> 00:32:32,500
You're not from here, I can tell.
You don't know the rules.

583
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:35,125
We women have to help each other out!

584
00:32:35,208 --> 00:32:37,208
-Have a nice day.
-No, don't leave!

585
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:39,166
-Let's have a drink.
-I'd love to.

586
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:42,500
I have all we need at my estate in Nohant.

587
00:32:43,958 --> 00:32:47,166
-George, nice to meet you.
-Charlie.

588
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,250
I love your dress!

589
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,541
You can have it.

590
00:33:09,791 --> 00:33:10,875
Gainsbourg!

591
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:12,375
Chopin!

592
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:14,708
Étude 3, opus 10.

593
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:17,916
Okay. I was wondering,

594
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:21,750
which illness permits me to wear pants?

595
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:24,625
-Loose organs?
-No.

596
00:33:24,708 --> 00:33:26,125
Excessive hairiness?

597
00:33:26,875 --> 00:33:28,375
No? Varicose veins?

598
00:33:28,708 --> 00:33:29,875
Greed.

599
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,083
I had to pay off a doctor.

600
00:33:32,166 --> 00:33:33,375
Pay off...

601
00:33:33,916 --> 00:33:36,583
How do you earn a living, George?

602
00:33:37,541 --> 00:33:38,875
I write books.

603
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:44,125
Wait, I'm getting drunk
with George Sand, the author?

604
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:46,458
Authoress.

605
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:49,708
Even if the cretins in the French Academy

606
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:52,916
removed the word
which dates back to the 14th century.

607
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,333
Oh, yeah?

608
00:33:54,416 --> 00:33:56,500
They took it out of the dictionary?

609
00:33:57,333 --> 00:33:58,375
Why?

610
00:33:58,458 --> 00:34:01,750
Because those men think
a woman shouldn't write.

611
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:05,625
They're real...

612
00:34:06,416 --> 00:34:07,833
doddery old men!

613
00:34:08,166 --> 00:34:10,416
I'd call them sacks of shit!

614
00:34:12,458 --> 00:34:13,958
I prefer doddery old men.

615
00:34:14,041 --> 00:34:16,458
Of course you do. You're George Sand.

616
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,791
I'm so ashamed.
I've never read anything by you.

617
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:23,166
I've only written more than 260 books.

618
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:26,375
So it's strange we didn't
read you in school.

619
00:34:27,458 --> 00:34:28,625
One day perhaps.

620
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:32,250
-After I die.
-No, George.

621
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:35,666
I have something to confess.
I'm from the future.

622
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,041
This taxi... driver

623
00:34:38,958 --> 00:34:40,375
sent me to the past.

624
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:43,208
I went to the Middle Ages,

625
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:46,083
pre-history, and 1964.

626
00:34:46,166 --> 00:34:49,625
Wow! What's the future like in 1964?

627
00:34:49,708 --> 00:34:51,500
Well, no, '64 is in the past.

628
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:53,416
So, you're from the past?

629
00:34:54,916 --> 00:34:56,291
Well, technically, yes.

630
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:59,375
But what I mean is that in my present,

631
00:34:59,458 --> 00:35:01,916
which is your future, well, at school,

632
00:35:02,958 --> 00:35:05,083
-we read Balzac.
-He's a friend.

633
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:07,125
-Victor Hugo.
-He's a friend.

634
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:09,250
-Alfred de Musset.
-He's a lover.

635
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:12,625
-You're sleeping with Alfred de Musset?
-Not anymore.

636
00:35:12,708 --> 00:35:14,416
Who are you sleeping with now?

637
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,333
-Stendhal?
-No, he's a friend.

638
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,416
Now I'm seeing...

639
00:35:20,458 --> 00:35:21,958
-Frédéric.
-Fredounet?

640
00:35:22,041 --> 00:35:23,083
No!

641
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,208
-Who?
-Chopin.

642
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:29,041
You're sleeping with Frédéric Chopin?

643
00:35:29,791 --> 00:35:31,375
You're a star-fucker!

644
00:35:32,291 --> 00:35:37,250
See? We know the works of your friends,
your boyfriends, but not yours.

645
00:35:38,458 --> 00:35:40,750
That's why I write under a man's name.

646
00:35:41,708 --> 00:35:43,250
Female, male,

647
00:35:44,666 --> 00:35:46,000
what's the difference?

648
00:35:46,791 --> 00:35:47,708
A dick?

649
00:35:49,041 --> 00:35:51,000
An unnecessary appendage.

650
00:35:51,541 --> 00:35:52,666
Believe me.

651
00:35:57,416 --> 00:35:59,083
I'm free, Charlie.

652
00:35:59,166 --> 00:36:01,291
-Free in my head and my body.
-Okay.

653
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:03,791
Don't be scared. I know it's forbidden.

654
00:36:03,875 --> 00:36:07,083
But this estate shelters
my freedom beautifully,

655
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:11,541
the freedom we must hide
from a puritanical world.

656
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,333
What's this mark?

657
00:36:18,833 --> 00:36:20,166
It's a birthmark.

658
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:25,708
George, George!

659
00:36:25,791 --> 00:36:28,916
I've never... with a woman, okay?

660
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,083
-No?
-No.

661
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,625
-So I think I might need...
-What?

662
00:36:36,041 --> 00:36:37,583
Some therapeutic substances.

663
00:36:37,666 --> 00:36:38,958
I have what you need.

664
00:36:40,458 --> 00:36:41,916
Really? Okay.

665
00:36:44,625 --> 00:36:46,166
This dress sucks!

666
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:51,416
I was thinking of something stronger.

667
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,000
There's nothing stronger.

668
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:54,791
Okay, so let's do it.

669
00:36:55,416 --> 00:37:00,333
I'm drinking to go back
to the 21st century,

670
00:37:00,416 --> 00:37:03,708
where you can wear pants
without going to jail.

671
00:37:04,958 --> 00:37:06,583
In 150 years,

672
00:37:06,666 --> 00:37:08,166
I'll probably be dead.

673
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,916
So, let's drink!

674
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,708
To freedom, to pants, and to women!

675
00:37:12,791 --> 00:37:14,416
Bottoms up!

676
00:37:18,791 --> 00:37:19,791
Charlie?

677
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,666
Where'd she go?

678
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:29,208
You tolerate us,
but we want to participate!

679
00:37:29,291 --> 00:37:32,791
I'll remind you that women are excluded
from all political clubs

680
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,458
except here, with the Jacobins.

681
00:37:34,541 --> 00:37:37,083
Well, clearly alcohol won't bring me back.

682
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:39,166
Calm down, ladies!

683
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,875
Women have no place in politics!

684
00:37:42,833 --> 00:37:44,916
They're a danger to the revolution.

685
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:49,958
They corrupt men in their beds.

686
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:52,541
Women go over there!
You have no business here.

687
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:53,625
Doddery old man!

688
00:37:53,708 --> 00:37:56,291
We didn't need women to take the Bastille!

689
00:37:57,416 --> 00:37:59,041
Women go over there!

690
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:00,833
Go, go...

691
00:38:02,916 --> 00:38:04,583
-Citizen Robespierre?
-What?

692
00:38:04,666 --> 00:38:08,833
Without us, the King would
never have ratified your Rights of Man.

693
00:38:08,916 --> 00:38:10,750
Men may have taken the Bastille,

694
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:13,000
but women took the King!

695
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:15,583
Is that true?

696
00:38:16,083 --> 00:38:18,833
Thank you, ladies, for participating.

697
00:38:18,916 --> 00:38:21,541
You can now return to your kitchens.

698
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:24,375
Seriously?

699
00:38:24,458 --> 00:38:25,916
You go back to the kitchen!

700
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,250
This is 1793,

701
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:31,000
and we want to speak on the platform!

702
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:32,333
Here, here!

703
00:38:32,416 --> 00:38:34,291
Citizen Olympe de Gouges,

704
00:38:34,375 --> 00:38:37,041
you know very well women
cannot come up here.

705
00:38:37,125 --> 00:38:41,083
If women can ascend the gallows,
they should also ascend the platform.

706
00:38:41,166 --> 00:38:42,166
She's right!

707
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:46,750
I agree!

708
00:38:46,833 --> 00:38:48,708
I'm a man and I ask to speak.

709
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:49,875
Who's that?

710
00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:52,541
You may speak, Nicolas de Condorcet!

711
00:39:05,583 --> 00:39:07,250
Sir, you're a mathematician.

712
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:09,916
Educate us on subtraction and addition,

713
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,208
but leave politics to us.

714
00:39:17,041 --> 00:39:18,666
As a mathematician,

715
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:21,208
I know it doesn't add up
when half of humankind

716
00:39:21,291 --> 00:39:24,625
is deprived of rights,
and the other half, their ideas.

717
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:27,041
Is it me or is he really sexy?

718
00:39:27,125 --> 00:39:29,166
-It's a waste...
-Okay. It's only me.

719
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,916
-...to ignore women in the revolution.
-Bravo!

720
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,833
Let them have responsibilities.

721
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:40,916
And who'll speak on the platform
when they're home pregnant?

722
00:39:41,458 --> 00:39:42,333
Seriously?

723
00:39:42,416 --> 00:39:44,750
Or when they're temporarily indisposed?

724
00:39:48,541 --> 00:39:51,208
No woman has ever proven herself
in politics.

725
00:39:51,291 --> 00:39:53,208
That's mathematical, Mr. de Condorcet.

726
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:56,250
Firstly, citizenship is not only
granted to men of genius.

727
00:39:56,333 --> 00:39:58,000
Just look at Robespierre!

728
00:39:58,083 --> 00:39:58,958
Who said that?

729
00:39:59,833 --> 00:40:03,416
Secondly, it's easy to attribute
skill and courage to men,

730
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:06,958
but what do you make of
female political leaders abroad?

731
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:08,041
For example...

732
00:40:08,125 --> 00:40:11,416
Margaret Thatcher! Or Angela Merkel.
Michelle Obama.

733
00:40:12,708 --> 00:40:15,000
I was thinking more
of Elizabeth of England,

734
00:40:15,083 --> 00:40:17,791
Maria Theresa of Austria,
or the Catherines of Russia.

735
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:19,083
Them too!

736
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:20,541
Who are they again?

737
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:23,625
Thirdly, we cannot verify
whether women have talent

738
00:40:23,708 --> 00:40:26,666
-if we do not allow them to express it.
-Bravo!

739
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:30,416
Nicolas, president! Nicolas...

740
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:34,583
A woman who speaks brilliantly
on the platform

741
00:40:35,875 --> 00:40:37,416
could only be a man.

742
00:40:41,166 --> 00:40:42,208
Let's find out!

743
00:40:42,291 --> 00:40:43,583
I ask to speak.

744
00:40:43,666 --> 00:40:46,875
Citizen Olympe de Gouges,
your request to speak is denied.

745
00:40:46,958 --> 00:40:49,500
Then here's my Declaration
of the Rights of Woman

746
00:40:49,583 --> 00:40:52,708
and the Female Citizen that I wrote
and I ask you to read.

747
00:40:52,791 --> 00:40:53,958
You kick ass, lady!

748
00:40:54,041 --> 00:40:57,375
Your rag will never be read
in this assembly. Guards, remove her!

749
00:40:57,458 --> 00:40:58,958
-"Mothers..."
-Silence her!

750
00:40:59,041 --> 00:41:02,791
"...sisters, female citizen
representatives of the nation, ask..."

751
00:41:02,875 --> 00:41:03,750
Here!

752
00:41:05,458 --> 00:41:06,583
Nicolas!

753
00:41:06,666 --> 00:41:09,625
"...ask to be represented
in the National Assembly.

754
00:41:09,708 --> 00:41:13,500
"Considering that ignorance, neglect,
or contempt of the Rights of Women

755
00:41:13,583 --> 00:41:17,333
"are the sole causes of public misfortune
and corruption of governments

756
00:41:17,416 --> 00:41:18,666
"have resolved..."

757
00:41:24,208 --> 00:41:25,125
This is over!

758
00:41:25,958 --> 00:41:27,875
You won't keep me from speaking!

759
00:41:28,833 --> 00:41:29,750
Yeah!

760
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:32,250
Oh, Nicolas!

761
00:41:32,625 --> 00:41:36,291
You're so... So...

762
00:41:36,708 --> 00:41:37,916
Intelligent.

763
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,916
Olympe?

764
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:45,375
Today, no one was listening,
but history will remember us.

765
00:41:45,458 --> 00:41:47,708
Well, don't get carried away, you two.

766
00:41:47,791 --> 00:41:49,375
Because I didn't know you.

767
00:41:49,458 --> 00:41:50,666
You're not in any book.

768
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,833
Danto, Marat, that moron Robespierre...

769
00:41:52,916 --> 00:41:54,708
But Nicolas de Condorcet...

770
00:41:55,125 --> 00:41:58,000
You're a high school
and a statue outside my building.

771
00:41:58,083 --> 00:42:01,250
And you, Olympe de Gouges,
you're not even a small museum.

772
00:42:01,333 --> 00:42:04,125
Even though you're right
about everything, it's crazy!

773
00:42:04,208 --> 00:42:06,708
You need to create buzz
about your Declaration.

774
00:42:07,875 --> 00:42:09,208
You're not getting it.

775
00:42:09,291 --> 00:42:13,458
I'd need to explain the Internet,
computers, social media.

776
00:42:14,208 --> 00:42:17,291
So, we put stuff on the feed,

777
00:42:17,375 --> 00:42:18,750
then on our wall,

778
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:20,541
and people read it.

779
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:23,916
Great idea! We'll put posters
on all the walls in Paris.

780
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,916
-No one has ever done that!
-Let's do it!

781
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,833
-You'll risk the guillotine.
-I don't fear death.

782
00:42:29,916 --> 00:42:31,666
Me neither. I'm a Highlander

783
00:42:32,791 --> 00:42:34,125
in quantum-leap mode.

784
00:42:35,166 --> 00:42:38,791
DECLARATION OF THE RIGHTS OF WOMAN
AND THE FEMALE CITIZEN

785
00:42:38,875 --> 00:42:41,375
What's this about women who took the King?

786
00:42:41,708 --> 00:42:43,166
Well, the women's march.

787
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,708
Never heard of it.

788
00:42:44,916 --> 00:42:47,458
On October 5,

789
00:42:47,541 --> 00:42:51,541
8,000 Parisian women marched up to
the Palace of Versailles to demand bread

790
00:42:51,625 --> 00:42:55,083
and force the king to ratify
their damn declaration.

791
00:42:55,166 --> 00:42:56,916
8,000, can you believe it?

792
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,083
8,000?

793
00:42:58,541 --> 00:43:01,333
According to the organizers or the police?

794
00:43:01,416 --> 00:43:03,416
-Same thing!
-Not where I'm from.

795
00:43:12,791 --> 00:43:16,666
Where I'm from, the the Rights of Man
are for both men and women.

796
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:20,458
No, both men and women would be "human."

797
00:43:20,541 --> 00:43:24,250
And their declaration
only gives voting rights to...

798
00:43:24,583 --> 00:43:25,875
Men.

799
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,416
So that means the Rights of Man

800
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,458
is just for men?

801
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,291
You're a funny one.

802
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:33,708
That's crazy!

803
00:43:34,166 --> 00:43:37,291
That's crazy. Men have been playing us
for fools for years?

804
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:40,666
Yes, but with this,
we're going to remind them we exist.

805
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,166
Those coprolites.

806
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:45,833
-What?
-Coprolite. Fossilized excrement.

807
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:49,208
I like that even more
than "doddery old man."

808
00:43:49,291 --> 00:43:51,708
It's a sack of shit, but fossilized.

809
00:43:53,416 --> 00:43:56,041
Yeah, but not all men are coprolites.

810
00:43:56,125 --> 00:43:57,750
Oh, yeah? Like who?

811
00:43:57,833 --> 00:43:59,208
Nicolas de Condorcet!

812
00:43:59,958 --> 00:44:02,416
He reeks testosterone.

813
00:44:03,166 --> 00:44:04,416
I'm going to do him.

814
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,458
Now's my chance, with my cool hat.

815
00:44:08,625 --> 00:44:09,625
Citizens!

816
00:44:17,041 --> 00:44:18,708
Citizen Olympe de Gouges,

817
00:44:18,791 --> 00:44:22,166
you're under arrest for violating
the sovereignty of the people.

818
00:44:24,083 --> 00:44:25,458
No! Leave her alone!

819
00:44:25,541 --> 00:44:27,375
I'm a lawyer.

820
00:44:27,458 --> 00:44:29,458
I demand to see the arrest warrant

821
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:32,625
to verify it isn't corrupted
by any procedural error.

822
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:37,000
Bunch of coprolites!
You owe us a modicum of...

823
00:44:39,125 --> 00:44:41,125
Charlie, you're so, so...

824
00:44:42,708 --> 00:44:43,708
intelligent.

825
00:44:46,791 --> 00:44:47,875
Thank you.

826
00:45:05,333 --> 00:45:07,125
What's this now?

827
00:45:21,333 --> 00:45:22,541
What year is it?

828
00:45:22,625 --> 00:45:24,083
1789, apparently.

829
00:45:24,166 --> 00:45:25,625
No, what date is it today?

830
00:45:25,708 --> 00:45:28,083
-March 8, 1982.
-What about Olympe de Gouges?

831
00:45:28,166 --> 00:45:30,791
-Who?
-What happened to Olympe de Gouges!

832
00:45:30,875 --> 00:45:32,416
Let go of me, crazy lady!

833
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,541
LIBRARY

834
00:45:40,083 --> 00:45:41,333
Decapitated!

835
00:45:43,166 --> 00:45:44,416
They decapitated her.

836
00:45:46,416 --> 00:45:47,416
It's my fault!

837
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:50,041
I told he to put up posters.

838
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,375
And Nicolas? What did they do to Nicolas?

839
00:46:22,333 --> 00:46:23,666
Hubert, why am I here?

840
00:46:24,166 --> 00:46:26,875
And why the French Revolution?

841
00:46:29,041 --> 00:46:30,375
Answer me, please!

842
00:46:31,583 --> 00:46:35,750
Did you know Nicolas poisoned himself
to avoid the guillotine?

843
00:46:35,833 --> 00:46:39,541
That's weird, the death penalty
has just been abolished by Badinter.

844
00:46:39,625 --> 00:46:42,875
Weird, yeah. Two hundred years too late.

845
00:46:43,916 --> 00:46:45,375
I've had enough of this.

846
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,500
I want to go home.
I want all this to stop.

847
00:46:51,166 --> 00:46:52,041
Hubert!

848
00:46:53,125 --> 00:46:53,958
Hubert!

849
00:46:57,541 --> 00:46:58,666
There he is.

850
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:00,875
There you are!

851
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Now, take me home!

852
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,791
-And where is that?
-Who are you?

853
00:47:08,875 --> 00:47:10,708
The taxi drive you just hailed.

854
00:47:11,291 --> 00:47:14,250
So, honey, tell me,
do you live with your parents?

855
00:47:14,333 --> 00:47:16,833
Well, yes, in '82 I lived with my parents.

856
00:47:17,083 --> 00:47:19,083
That was the year Mom left Dad.

857
00:47:21,791 --> 00:47:24,625
I know where to go!
60 de Bretagne street, please

858
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:26,833
And we're off, darling.

859
00:47:42,041 --> 00:47:44,208
Is that costume for a movie?

860
00:47:45,666 --> 00:47:47,916
Well, you're very pretty, honey.

861
00:47:50,708 --> 00:47:52,375
Nice costume! I like it.

862
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:56,208
Really. You're a sexy
little revolutionary.

863
00:48:01,875 --> 00:48:02,958
Here we are.

864
00:48:03,041 --> 00:48:05,625
That's 64 francs and 45 cents.

865
00:48:05,833 --> 00:48:08,291
Yes, but I don't have any money, see?

866
00:48:08,375 --> 00:48:10,250
I'll just go ask my dad.

867
00:48:10,333 --> 00:48:13,791
A beautiful woman like you
doesn't have to ask her dad.

868
00:48:14,541 --> 00:48:17,250
We can settle things like adults.
Come up here.

869
00:48:18,125 --> 00:48:21,083
It's like ten bucks!
What would I do for ten bucks?

870
00:48:21,625 --> 00:48:23,458
Don't worry, we'll find out.

871
00:48:24,291 --> 00:48:27,625
You're going to get exposed
for the pig you are,

872
00:48:27,708 --> 00:48:30,125
so you know what? Enjoy it while it lasts.

873
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:32,250
And remember this, #MeToo.

874
00:48:32,958 --> 00:48:33,916
Hashtag what?

875
00:48:34,333 --> 00:48:37,083
Get out of here or my dad
will kick your teeth in!

876
00:48:37,166 --> 00:48:39,916
-Skank! Scumbag! Filthy whore!
-That's right.

877
00:48:46,416 --> 00:48:47,375
Mom.

878
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:50,875
Oh, Dad!

879
00:48:52,541 --> 00:48:53,708
My precious Dad.

880
00:49:05,916 --> 00:49:06,750
Dad?

881
00:49:06,833 --> 00:49:08,916
And for the first time in France,

882
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,958
this Monday, March 8, will officially be
dedicated to women.

883
00:49:13,041 --> 00:49:15,416
It will be celebrated at the Elysée Palace

884
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:17,333
where the Head of State has invited...

885
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:22,625
Look what you made me do!

886
00:49:24,166 --> 00:49:26,083
How could I have forgotten this?

887
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:29,125
It wasn't a birthmark!

888
00:49:29,208 --> 00:49:31,291
You sick man! You burned me!

889
00:49:31,416 --> 00:49:33,416
Mom! Mom!

890
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,125
You'll get one too!

891
00:49:40,208 --> 00:49:41,750
Look what you made me do!

892
00:49:42,375 --> 00:49:43,375
Get out!

893
00:49:45,791 --> 00:49:46,916
Dad!

894
00:49:50,125 --> 00:49:51,083
Whoa!

895
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:54,458
Hello, need a ride?

896
00:49:55,458 --> 00:49:56,708
You knew!

897
00:49:56,791 --> 00:49:58,916
You knew my dad was violent!

898
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,375
Why did my mom let me believe otherwise?

899
00:50:01,458 --> 00:50:03,291
You believed it all by yourself.

900
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:06,250
How could I have blocked
that out all these years?

901
00:50:06,333 --> 00:50:08,541
She actually left him to protect me.

902
00:50:08,666 --> 00:50:10,875
She didn't want to tarnish his image.

903
00:50:10,958 --> 00:50:13,416
Hubert! Take me back. I miss my mom!

904
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:16,166
Your mom?
The one you criticize all the time?

905
00:50:18,291 --> 00:50:22,041
It's so funny having innocent people
wander around their past.

906
00:50:22,125 --> 00:50:24,583
Those who forget their past
are condemned...

907
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:26,916
To...

908
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,208
Relive it!

909
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:30,333
Could you stop with the quotes, Yoda?

910
00:50:30,416 --> 00:50:31,750
No, Winston Churchill.

911
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:33,958
Now hop in!

912
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:37,250
Okay, Hubert! I get it, I've had enough.

913
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:39,208
We're still well off the mark.

914
00:50:39,291 --> 00:50:40,250
Look,...

915
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:45,458
These dresses really suck.

916
00:50:48,833 --> 00:50:50,333
I told you, I understand.

917
00:50:52,041 --> 00:50:53,333
I got it.

918
00:50:53,416 --> 00:50:54,958
All men are coprolites.

919
00:50:55,375 --> 00:50:56,916
My dad, my boss.

920
00:50:57,875 --> 00:51:00,708
You! Which means, we can go home.

921
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:03,750
Him too?

922
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:07,208
Oh, Nicolas! No, not him.

923
00:51:07,958 --> 00:51:11,958
You're right, all men are coprolites
except for Nicolas de Condorcet.

924
00:51:12,375 --> 00:51:14,250
So, we still have a way to go.

925
00:51:16,708 --> 00:51:18,791
That's enough, I'll take the reins!

926
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:20,666
Where are we? And when are we?

927
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:24,041
Paris, Dauphine Street, April 19, 1906.

928
00:51:24,125 --> 00:51:26,875
What are we doing here?
Do I have to kill someone again?

929
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:29,875
You didn't kill anyone, history did.
You can't change that.

930
00:51:29,958 --> 00:51:31,541
Who will history kill next?

931
00:51:37,625 --> 00:51:40,250
Please tell me they have
speed bumps in 1906?

932
00:51:40,333 --> 00:51:42,250
Pierre! Pierre!

933
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:44,750
Pierre!

934
00:51:46,708 --> 00:51:47,916
Is that Marie Curie?

935
00:51:48,416 --> 00:51:50,583
Don't tell me I killed Pierre Curie!

936
00:51:51,458 --> 00:51:52,541
This can't be!

937
00:51:53,333 --> 00:51:54,625
I'm sorry!

938
00:51:54,708 --> 00:51:55,875
So sorry!

939
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:58,500
Hubert, come back!

940
00:52:00,708 --> 00:52:02,625
Don't worry, he'll pull through.

941
00:52:03,166 --> 00:52:05,000
I'll put him recovery position.

942
00:52:05,083 --> 00:52:07,291
Then pull his leg out.

943
00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:08,458
Like that.

944
00:52:09,916 --> 00:52:11,791
It's nothing! Just a sprain.

945
00:52:12,125 --> 00:52:14,083
There, nothing at all.

946
00:52:18,791 --> 00:52:22,750
His passing is a tragedy for science,
particularly for the Sorbonne,

947
00:52:23,416 --> 00:52:25,958
who has lost
an admirable physics professor.

948
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:29,625
We'll never find anyone to replace him.

949
00:52:30,083 --> 00:52:34,208
No one truly understands the significance
of his work on radioactivity.

950
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:37,791
Radioactivity?
Is it really necessary to teach that?

951
00:52:37,875 --> 00:52:39,666
Or even study?

952
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:42,375
I doubt it'll lead
to any major discoveries.

953
00:52:43,458 --> 00:52:45,333
Sorry to interrupt, gentlemen,

954
00:52:45,416 --> 00:52:48,333
but if they're looking
to replace Pierre Curie,

955
00:52:48,416 --> 00:52:49,916
tell them to hire Marie Curie.

956
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,916
A woman? Come on.

957
00:52:53,208 --> 00:52:55,708
-So what?
-So, miss,

958
00:52:56,333 --> 00:52:59,041
a woman has never
held a post at a university.

959
00:52:59,791 --> 00:53:00,791
And you are?

960
00:53:01,458 --> 00:53:02,416
Aristide Briand.

961
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:06,083
Yes, your name rings a bell...
What do you do again?

962
00:53:06,166 --> 00:53:08,958
He's only the Minister of Education.

963
00:53:10,083 --> 00:53:11,875
-And you are?
-A woman.

964
00:53:12,958 --> 00:53:16,125
Who is wondering why a woman
can't be a professor.

965
00:53:16,625 --> 00:53:18,208
Because she's a woman,

966
00:53:18,291 --> 00:53:21,125
and women can't teach men.

967
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:28,125
Clearly, with your view of radioactivity,
I understood you're a real champ.

968
00:53:28,541 --> 00:53:30,166
But you, Aristide Briand,

969
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:34,166
do you want to be someone
no one remembers?

970
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:35,875
Like... him?

971
00:53:35,958 --> 00:53:37,875
Or do you want to be a minister

972
00:53:38,333 --> 00:53:39,916
history will remember...

973
00:53:40,416 --> 00:53:43,333
because he appointed Marie Curie
to the Sorbonne?

974
00:53:46,833 --> 00:53:49,958
Of course, with the sudden death
of Pierre Curie,

975
00:53:50,041 --> 00:53:53,666
she's the only one who understands
their work on radioactivity, but...

976
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:54,791
She's a woman.

977
00:53:55,625 --> 00:53:56,666
You were saying?

978
00:53:58,041 --> 00:54:00,416
-Will she agree to it?
-Of course!

979
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:01,541
No.

980
00:54:02,291 --> 00:54:03,500
You can't refuse!

981
00:54:03,583 --> 00:54:05,833
I have research, two daughters to raise,

982
00:54:05,916 --> 00:54:07,791
and a woman cannot be a professor.

983
00:54:07,875 --> 00:54:08,750
Yes! You!

984
00:54:09,125 --> 00:54:12,250
You'll be the most celebrated
woman in France.

985
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:15,875
You'll have schools and hospitals
named after you.

986
00:54:15,958 --> 00:54:18,041
And 999 streets!

987
00:54:18,666 --> 00:54:21,583
-You'll win the Nobel Prize.
-I already did with Pierre.

988
00:54:21,666 --> 00:54:23,083
You'll get another one.

989
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:27,625
No, a woman has never won
a Nobel Prize in physics or chemistry.

990
00:54:28,666 --> 00:54:31,750
You'll be the first!
Thanks to... all this!

991
00:54:32,833 --> 00:54:35,291
Wait, I'm in Marie Curie's lab...

992
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:40,125
Marie, what's that?
It's not uranium, is it?

993
00:54:40,208 --> 00:54:41,250
No.

994
00:54:41,333 --> 00:54:44,416
It's radium.
It's millions of times more radioactive.

995
00:54:44,916 --> 00:54:47,541
Radiation? Marie, guys!

996
00:54:47,625 --> 00:54:50,250
-We need to protect ourselves!
-From what?

997
00:54:50,333 --> 00:54:52,666
-Do you have any tinfoil?
-What?

998
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:56,458
Belts?

999
00:54:59,208 --> 00:55:04,625
So, what's the first female professor
going to teach her students?

1000
00:55:04,708 --> 00:55:05,875
Bravo!

1001
00:55:08,416 --> 00:55:11,041
A female professor?
The world is upside-down!

1002
00:55:11,416 --> 00:55:13,375
Why not a female prime minister?

1003
00:55:14,333 --> 00:55:18,000
This may shock you, but it'll happen.
Her name's Edith Cresson.

1004
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:21,041
Charlie, can you lower the blinds, please?

1005
00:55:21,125 --> 00:55:22,083
Yes, excuse me.

1006
00:55:23,416 --> 00:55:26,333
Okay, Hubert, I can go home.
I've understood.

1007
00:55:26,416 --> 00:55:27,666
So, to succeed,

1008
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:30,166
a woman doesn't need a husband.

1009
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:34,875
You're right, I already knew that.
That's not it.

1010
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:37,875
To succeed, a woman needs
to run over her husband?

1011
00:55:41,041 --> 00:55:42,666
Okay, I still don't get it.

1012
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:45,750
Allow me to introduce radium.

1013
00:55:50,583 --> 00:55:52,083
Oh, come on.

1014
00:55:52,166 --> 00:55:53,916
Enough with the radium!

1015
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,791
She'll give everyone cancer!

1016
00:55:56,416 --> 00:55:59,208
Ladies and gentlemen, we must leave!

1017
00:56:00,041 --> 00:56:01,208
I'm so stupid.

1018
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:03,291
Gentlemen, we must leave!

1019
00:56:06,333 --> 00:56:07,291
Fire!

1020
00:56:09,375 --> 00:56:10,666
-There we go!
-Move!

1021
00:56:15,458 --> 00:56:17,166
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

1022
00:56:20,125 --> 00:56:21,083
Are you okay?

1023
00:56:22,791 --> 00:56:23,750
Yes.

1024
00:56:24,583 --> 00:56:25,416
Who are you?

1025
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:27,541
I'm...

1026
00:56:27,625 --> 00:56:29,250
-The new maid, right?
-Sure.

1027
00:56:29,958 --> 00:56:32,416
-Are you sick?
-Nauseous every morning.

1028
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:33,875
Are you pregnant?

1029
00:56:33,958 --> 00:56:35,958
Of course not, I'm not married.

1030
00:56:36,416 --> 00:56:38,166
-Did you sleep with someone?
-No.

1031
00:56:38,791 --> 00:56:39,666
Yes?

1032
00:56:40,708 --> 00:56:41,583
A little bit.

1033
00:56:41,666 --> 00:56:42,666
With who?

1034
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:44,000
Well, my master.

1035
00:56:44,708 --> 00:56:46,333
-Esther!
-It's my master.

1036
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:01,833
-Yes, sir?
-Thirsty!

1037
00:57:01,916 --> 00:57:03,750
-Yes, sir.
-Hungry.

1038
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:05,791
Yes, sir.

1039
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,458
Your master is Napoleon?

1040
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:16,791
Well, yes!

1041
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,291
You're going to have Napoleon's baby?

1042
00:57:19,375 --> 00:57:20,375
That's great!

1043
00:57:21,208 --> 00:57:22,166
That's crazy!

1044
00:57:23,208 --> 00:57:25,041
If I'm pregnant, what do I do?

1045
00:57:25,291 --> 00:57:28,375
Because unmarried women can't find work

1046
00:57:28,458 --> 00:57:30,250
and are banished from society!

1047
00:57:34,166 --> 00:57:35,500
Just get an abortion.

1048
00:57:36,958 --> 00:57:38,166
Abortion is a crime!

1049
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:40,000
You can end up in prison!

1050
00:57:40,291 --> 00:57:41,416
Where are you from?

1051
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,166
Yeah, sorry, it's the 1800s.

1052
00:57:44,916 --> 00:57:46,458
Anyway, I was wondering...

1053
00:57:46,541 --> 00:57:48,916
Does Napoleon sleep with all his maids?

1054
00:57:50,416 --> 00:57:51,416
Yes.

1055
00:57:53,791 --> 00:57:54,708
No, leave it.

1056
00:57:56,166 --> 00:57:58,708
I'll do it.
In your condition, it's better.

1057
00:58:00,666 --> 00:58:02,000
Give me your apron.

1058
00:58:02,833 --> 00:58:04,333
You can't change history.

1059
00:58:05,166 --> 00:58:07,166
But you can take advantage of it.

1060
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:18,416
There she is, the sexy maid.

1061
00:58:18,916 --> 00:58:22,583
George Sand isn't the only one
who can sleep with celebrities.

1062
00:58:28,375 --> 00:58:29,333
Come in.

1063
00:58:41,833 --> 00:58:43,166
I'm the new maid.

1064
00:58:44,208 --> 00:58:47,625
I understand there's a tradition
with the new ones.

1065
00:58:48,875 --> 00:58:51,000
And I like to respect traditions.

1066
00:58:51,083 --> 00:58:54,791
Especially because it's been ages
since I've... been respected.

1067
00:58:55,791 --> 00:58:56,791
Traditionally.

1068
00:58:58,375 --> 00:58:59,916
That's enough. Bottoms up!

1069
00:59:00,875 --> 00:59:01,791
What the...

1070
00:59:02,625 --> 00:59:03,958
How dare you?

1071
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:05,458
Do you know who I am?

1072
00:59:05,541 --> 00:59:08,125
Yes, Napoleon.
And you can grumble about it later.

1073
00:59:08,208 --> 00:59:09,833
Straddle up, Your Majesty.

1074
00:59:09,916 --> 00:59:11,333
Impossible, I have to work!

1075
00:59:11,416 --> 00:59:13,125
Hey! Impossible isn't French.

1076
00:59:13,833 --> 00:59:14,958
I love that!

1077
00:59:15,625 --> 00:59:16,833
I'm going to use it.

1078
00:59:17,583 --> 00:59:18,500
I know.

1079
00:59:19,208 --> 00:59:20,791
For a maid, you really...

1080
00:59:20,875 --> 00:59:21,875
Have it made!

1081
00:59:23,458 --> 00:59:24,958
-Got a condom?
-A what?

1082
00:59:26,166 --> 00:59:27,791
All's fair in love and war!

1083
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:34,375
Oh, Your Majesty...

1084
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,000
Can I call you Nicolas?

1085
01:00:01,958 --> 01:00:04,583
Let me introduce you
to the little corporal.

1086
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:22,958
Nico...

1087
01:00:26,291 --> 01:00:27,500
Napo!

1088
01:00:31,708 --> 01:00:32,958
You're still working?

1089
01:00:33,041 --> 01:00:34,791
I'm writing the first Civil Code.

1090
01:00:34,875 --> 01:00:36,791
The Civil Code of 1804?

1091
01:00:36,875 --> 01:00:38,708
No, it's 1803.

1092
01:00:38,791 --> 01:00:41,291
Your code will be enacted next year.

1093
01:00:41,375 --> 01:00:45,000
This is the pen that wrote the Civil Code?
With your initials?

1094
01:00:45,083 --> 01:00:47,916
Can I keep it? Please, Napo?

1095
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,375
Keep it. A gift from Napoleon.

1096
01:00:51,875 --> 01:00:55,041
Ah, women. You give them a pen
and they're happy.

1097
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:03,750
"Woman is... eiuen?"

1098
01:01:04,166 --> 01:01:05,833
You have terrible handwriting.

1099
01:01:05,916 --> 01:01:07,791
No, not "eiuen," it's "given."

1100
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:11,708
"Woman is given to man to make children.

1101
01:01:11,791 --> 01:01:15,875
"She is therefore her property
as a fruit tree belongs to a gardener."

1102
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,125
You're putting that in?

1103
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:20,083
Well, yes.

1104
01:01:22,166 --> 01:01:23,083
Thirsty!

1105
01:01:23,791 --> 01:01:24,916
I'm not your maid.

1106
01:01:25,333 --> 01:01:26,208
Yes, you are.

1107
01:01:27,666 --> 01:01:31,291
No, I'm not. Actually, I'm a lawyer.

1108
01:01:32,958 --> 01:01:33,916
Lawyer?

1109
01:01:34,708 --> 01:01:35,583
Yeah.

1110
01:01:36,791 --> 01:01:38,291
That's funny because

1111
01:01:38,875 --> 01:01:39,958
I'm the one who...

1112
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:43,041
I reinstated lawyers,

1113
01:01:43,791 --> 01:01:45,500
and I didn't authorize women.

1114
01:01:45,875 --> 01:01:47,791
-Know why?
-I'm gonna enjoy this.

1115
01:01:47,875 --> 01:01:50,250
Because women are good for one thing.

1116
01:01:50,333 --> 01:01:51,750
Obeying their husbands.

1117
01:01:54,125 --> 01:01:55,125
Article...

1118
01:01:57,583 --> 01:01:59,416
Article 213 of my Code.

1119
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,125
"The husband must protect his wife.

1120
01:02:02,208 --> 01:02:04,875
"And the wife must obey her husband."

1121
01:02:06,291 --> 01:02:07,541
That's funny!

1122
01:02:07,625 --> 01:02:09,708
Because Article 213 was amended

1123
01:02:09,791 --> 01:02:12,458
and today it reads that
"Spouses shall jointly

1124
01:02:12,541 --> 01:02:15,375
"provide moral and material guidance
for the family."

1125
01:02:15,458 --> 01:02:16,416
Today?

1126
01:02:16,708 --> 01:02:18,458
What is this nonsense?

1127
01:02:18,541 --> 01:02:20,625
Today? I just read it to you today.

1128
01:02:20,708 --> 01:02:22,791
Obviously not today, today.

1129
01:02:22,875 --> 01:02:24,458
Today in the future.

1130
01:02:26,833 --> 01:02:27,791
There you go.

1131
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:33,708
That's why you'll never be man's equal.
You can't even understand time.

1132
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:35,750
What's your problem with women?

1133
01:02:35,833 --> 01:02:37,333
Your mother's a woman.

1134
01:02:37,416 --> 01:02:39,666
Your future child may be a girl.

1135
01:02:41,833 --> 01:02:43,041
I got you pregnant?

1136
01:02:43,125 --> 01:02:44,000
What?

1137
01:02:44,625 --> 01:02:46,583
We slept together 15 minutes ago!

1138
01:02:46,666 --> 01:02:49,166
Are you stupid? Not me, Esther!

1139
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:50,125
Esther?

1140
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:52,375
Esther the mulatto?

1141
01:02:52,458 --> 01:02:54,625
-Mulatto?
-Guards!

1142
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:58,000
That's right, he reinstated slavery.

1143
01:03:00,291 --> 01:03:01,208
Yes, sir.

1144
01:03:01,291 --> 01:03:03,291
Have Esther dismissed immediately.

1145
01:03:03,375 --> 01:03:04,541
-Yes, sir!
-What?

1146
01:03:04,625 --> 01:03:08,500
Dismiss a pregnant woman
and then abandon Josephine for sterility?

1147
01:03:08,916 --> 01:03:10,416
Josephine is sterile?

1148
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,166
-Oops.
-Who are you, witch?

1149
01:03:12,833 --> 01:03:15,291
-Hubert, not witches again.
-Guards!

1150
01:03:17,291 --> 01:03:18,875
-Yes, sir?
-Arrest her.

1151
01:03:18,958 --> 01:03:22,791
No, no, because today
there's a Code thanks to you!

1152
01:03:22,875 --> 01:03:26,416
No more arbitrariness,
no more witch trials

1153
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:28,208
or drownings or burnings.

1154
01:03:28,291 --> 01:03:30,208
Now you need a motive to arrest me.

1155
01:03:32,166 --> 01:03:34,166
She stole my pen with my initials.

1156
01:03:34,916 --> 01:03:36,000
Search her.

1157
01:03:36,833 --> 01:03:37,750
It'll be quick.

1158
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:43,541
I don't think she has it, sir.

1159
01:03:45,041 --> 01:03:46,041
Search her dress.

1160
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:50,583
It's so small.

1161
01:03:50,666 --> 01:03:52,583
I won't even waste time arguing.

1162
01:03:53,125 --> 01:03:55,250
So, what's the punishment?

1163
01:03:55,708 --> 01:03:57,041
An hour on the picket?

1164
01:03:57,125 --> 01:04:01,458
Seriously? Forced labor
for stealing a pen?

1165
01:04:02,375 --> 01:04:04,041
It was just a pen!

1166
01:04:04,125 --> 01:04:06,375
And I didn't even steal it.
This is not fair!

1167
01:04:06,458 --> 01:04:08,208
Okay, Hubert, I get it.

1168
01:04:08,291 --> 01:04:10,083
I freed guilty people, I know.

1169
01:04:10,166 --> 01:04:11,416
I won't do that anymore.

1170
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:14,291
Quit shouting! You're a criminal like us.

1171
01:04:14,375 --> 01:04:17,208
You stole a pen, her, a skirt,
her, two apples.

1172
01:04:17,291 --> 01:04:19,833
-What did you do?
-I cheated on my husband.

1173
01:04:19,916 --> 01:04:21,791
You're going to break rocks for that?

1174
01:04:21,875 --> 01:04:23,291
Men break rocks.

1175
01:04:23,458 --> 01:04:25,416
What do women do in labor camps?

1176
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:28,375
They give us to colonists
to repopulate the colonies.

1177
01:04:28,458 --> 01:04:30,083
I'd rather break rocks.

1178
01:04:30,166 --> 01:04:31,583
You don't get a choice.

1179
01:04:31,666 --> 01:04:33,250
27, come forward!

1180
01:04:37,958 --> 01:04:39,041
Number 27.

1181
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:40,750
That's the one I want.

1182
01:04:40,833 --> 01:04:41,833
She's all yours.

1183
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,375
No!

1184
01:04:43,458 --> 01:04:44,583
Get her!

1185
01:04:46,833 --> 01:04:49,041
Women are forbidden from public urinals!

1186
01:04:49,125 --> 01:04:52,000
Your weenie is too small
to see anyway, moron.

1187
01:04:52,083 --> 01:04:54,250
Public toilets for men only?

1188
01:04:54,333 --> 01:04:56,916
What do women do,
pee in the street standing up?

1189
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:01,791
Thanks, Hubert!

1190
01:05:05,916 --> 01:05:07,125
It's the Liberation!

1191
01:05:07,875 --> 01:05:09,833
Hubert! Why am I here?

1192
01:05:11,416 --> 01:05:13,791
Fine, don't answer.
I'll find out by myself.

1193
01:05:13,875 --> 01:05:15,083
Pardon, excuse me.

1194
01:05:19,333 --> 01:05:20,750
Pardon. Here we go.

1195
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:23,291
Hello, excuse me, what's going on?

1196
01:05:23,375 --> 01:05:24,541
Municipal elections.

1197
01:05:24,625 --> 01:05:26,208
And women can finally vote.

1198
01:05:26,291 --> 01:05:28,708
Today's the day women vote
for the first time?

1199
01:05:28,791 --> 01:05:30,750
-What's the day today?
-The 29th.

1200
01:05:30,833 --> 01:05:32,500
The whole date?

1201
01:05:32,583 --> 01:05:33,625
Month, day, year?

1202
01:05:33,708 --> 01:05:36,000
They can vote,
but they don't know the date.

1203
01:05:36,083 --> 01:05:37,958
It's April 29, 1945.

1204
01:05:38,041 --> 01:05:40,083
We got the right to vote so late?

1205
01:05:40,166 --> 01:05:42,416
Yes, and it's still too early
if you ask me.

1206
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:43,791
We didn't.

1207
01:05:46,458 --> 01:05:48,208
-Sorry?
-Forget it.

1208
01:05:48,291 --> 01:05:50,166
-Go ahead, ma'am.
-I will, sir.

1209
01:05:55,541 --> 01:05:56,666
You're toxic.

1210
01:06:05,875 --> 01:06:07,041
Vote cast!

1211
01:06:07,125 --> 01:06:08,375
Marie-Louise Fèvre.

1212
01:06:08,458 --> 01:06:10,250
October 17, 1918.

1213
01:06:12,833 --> 01:06:13,875
Vote cast!

1214
01:06:16,083 --> 01:06:18,166
-Can I borrow it?
-Grandma?

1215
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:19,541
Françoise!

1216
01:06:19,625 --> 01:06:22,250
-Lend your doll to the little girl.
-Mom?

1217
01:06:22,833 --> 01:06:24,458
Oh, Mom!

1218
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:27,875
Françoise, come here.

1219
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:29,583
Who are you?

1220
01:06:31,291 --> 01:06:32,458
Grandma!

1221
01:06:34,416 --> 01:06:36,958
Ma'am. I'm sorry, I'm just emotional.

1222
01:06:37,250 --> 01:06:39,166
I miss my family so much.

1223
01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:43,791
The war, Paris has finally been liberated
and the rest of France will be soon.

1224
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:45,791
Yes, and soon the Armistice!

1225
01:06:45,875 --> 01:06:47,208
That'll be a big day!

1226
01:06:47,291 --> 01:06:48,916
Today's a big day, too.

1227
01:06:49,833 --> 01:06:52,458
By the way, who did you vote for?

1228
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:54,625
I didn't vote.

1229
01:06:55,416 --> 01:06:57,541
My husband's not really for it.

1230
01:06:57,625 --> 01:06:59,666
But this is historic!

1231
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:02,791
Gran... Ma'am, you can't not vote!

1232
01:07:02,875 --> 01:07:05,458
I did it, Mom. I voted for the first time.

1233
01:07:05,541 --> 01:07:07,791
My big guy. You're a man now!

1234
01:07:07,875 --> 01:07:08,958
Uncle...

1235
01:07:10,875 --> 01:07:13,916
Your son. Your son voted and you didn't?

1236
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,541
-Well, yes.
-Mom, I put the paper in the envelope!

1237
01:07:16,625 --> 01:07:19,458
Hey, but I put it in the mailbox!

1238
01:07:19,541 --> 01:07:21,041
The ballot box, stupid.

1239
01:07:21,208 --> 01:07:22,333
I'm not stupid!

1240
01:07:22,416 --> 01:07:24,000
-Let me go!
-They're so young!

1241
01:07:24,083 --> 01:07:25,458
I'm not stupid!

1242
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:27,000
That's enough, boys!

1243
01:07:27,375 --> 01:07:29,625
Stop, let's go. Monique, we're going home.

1244
01:07:29,708 --> 01:07:32,083
No, she's not going. She'd like to vote.

1245
01:07:33,541 --> 01:07:35,166
What are you talking about?

1246
01:07:35,458 --> 01:07:39,208
Yes, René, I'd like to vote.
If it's okay with you, of course.

1247
01:07:40,583 --> 01:07:41,958
Don't be ridiculous.

1248
01:07:42,041 --> 01:07:44,375
She said she wants to vote.

1249
01:07:44,458 --> 01:07:47,250
Hey, suffragette, don't give
her any wild ideas!

1250
01:07:47,333 --> 01:07:50,000
-Please, René...
-And you! Don't make me...

1251
01:07:50,083 --> 01:07:52,041
You used to hit Grandma?

1252
01:07:53,291 --> 01:07:54,250
What?

1253
01:07:54,875 --> 01:07:57,541
Françoise, never let a man hit you, okay?

1254
01:07:57,625 --> 01:07:59,083
Leave my daughter alone.

1255
01:07:59,166 --> 01:08:03,875
And don't marry Christian Leroy!
Repeat after me! Christian Leroy!

1256
01:08:03,958 --> 01:08:05,041
Christian Leroy.

1257
01:08:05,125 --> 01:08:08,458
Because those who forget the past
are condemned to relive it.

1258
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,833
Winston Churchill said that.

1259
01:08:11,916 --> 01:08:12,916
No, he didn't.

1260
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,208
Well, he will... soon.

1261
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:17,500
Sir, your wife...

1262
01:08:18,750 --> 01:08:20,916
-Control her.
-She's not my wife!

1263
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,250
"She's not my wife."

1264
01:08:23,208 --> 01:08:24,416
No worries there.

1265
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:27,666
Wait,

1266
01:08:28,791 --> 01:08:30,500
if Mom never marries Dad,

1267
01:08:31,541 --> 01:08:32,750
I won't be born.

1268
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,250
I just killed myself.

1269
01:08:35,541 --> 01:08:36,541
Mom!

1270
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:39,666
Have you seen my mother?

1271
01:08:40,333 --> 01:08:41,416
Mom!

1272
01:08:42,291 --> 01:08:43,500
Move!

1273
01:08:44,375 --> 01:08:45,375
Mom!

1274
01:08:46,875 --> 01:08:49,041
Mom? Sorry. Mom!

1275
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:51,291
Have you seen my mother?

1276
01:08:51,833 --> 01:08:52,916
Mom?

1277
01:08:53,875 --> 01:08:55,250
Oh, Bobigny courthouse!

1278
01:08:56,333 --> 01:08:57,458
Oh, I'm...

1279
01:08:58,083 --> 01:09:00,458
Wide collars, turtleneck sweaters,

1280
01:09:00,541 --> 01:09:02,125
I'm not home yet.

1281
01:09:02,208 --> 01:09:05,166
I really hope they sentence
Marie-Claire's mother.

1282
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:07,000
Marie-Claire Chevalier?

1283
01:09:07,833 --> 01:09:10,291
-This is the Bobigny trial? It's 1972?
-Yes.

1284
01:09:10,375 --> 01:09:11,958
That means my mom is here!

1285
01:09:12,041 --> 01:09:14,958
I hope they sentence her, too.
Her daughter's a harlot.

1286
01:09:15,791 --> 01:09:19,041
How can you say that?
You're a girl, you're the same age!

1287
01:09:19,125 --> 01:09:21,333
Is your headband too tight or something?

1288
01:09:21,833 --> 01:09:24,500
Anyway, if Mom's here
she must be on the other side.

1289
01:09:24,583 --> 01:09:25,958
-Out of my way!
-Yes, go.

1290
01:09:26,041 --> 01:09:27,750
Stay on your side, ma'am, please!

1291
01:09:27,833 --> 01:09:29,541
-My mother's on that side.
-No!

1292
01:09:29,625 --> 01:09:30,708
But I'm pro-choice!

1293
01:09:30,791 --> 01:09:33,333
Of course you are. Get over there.

1294
01:09:33,416 --> 01:09:34,500
Okay, obviously...

1295
01:09:37,083 --> 01:09:38,333
That's provocation!

1296
01:09:39,791 --> 01:09:41,750
That's provocation! Unbelievable.

1297
01:09:41,833 --> 01:09:43,125
This is pointless!

1298
01:09:43,208 --> 01:09:45,750
Simone Veil will legalize abortion
in three years.

1299
01:09:45,833 --> 01:09:47,500
No! This is provocation.

1300
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:49,666
What now? If I go back, they'll kill me.

1301
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:50,916
Let her in!

1302
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,333
-Let her in!
-Go ahead.

1303
01:09:54,583 --> 01:09:56,666
Excuse me, do you know a Françoise?

1304
01:09:56,750 --> 01:09:57,833
-Françoise?
-Yes.

1305
01:09:57,916 --> 01:10:00,833
Of course. Hey, Françoise!
Someone's looking for you.

1306
01:10:00,916 --> 01:10:02,541
Oh, Mom!

1307
01:10:02,625 --> 01:10:04,958
Oh, sorry. You're going to be a mom!

1308
01:10:05,833 --> 01:10:06,791
That's great!

1309
01:10:07,416 --> 01:10:09,583
Yes, it happens to lots of women.

1310
01:10:09,666 --> 01:10:13,000
I was afraid you wouldn't
sleep with Dad. Well, the father.

1311
01:10:13,083 --> 01:10:14,833
I'm so happy!

1312
01:10:14,916 --> 01:10:15,916
Thanks.

1313
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,958
And your daughter will love you
more than she says.

1314
01:10:19,041 --> 01:10:20,708
Okay, but it might be a boy.

1315
01:10:20,791 --> 01:10:22,000
I don't think so.

1316
01:10:22,083 --> 01:10:23,958
Girl or boy, it'll be the same name.

1317
01:10:24,041 --> 01:10:25,333
SLUT SPECIAL
CHARLIE HEBDO

1318
01:10:25,416 --> 01:10:27,375
So, that's why? I never knew.

1319
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:28,791
That's crazy.

1320
01:10:30,208 --> 01:10:32,708
So, I am Charlie!

1321
01:10:32,791 --> 01:10:33,625
Okay!

1322
01:10:33,708 --> 01:10:35,916
Of course, you don't get the reference.

1323
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,250
The hearing is public!

1324
01:10:37,333 --> 01:10:38,541
Let us in!

1325
01:10:38,625 --> 01:10:40,000
In his closing argument,

1326
01:10:40,083 --> 01:10:44,708
the prosecutor asked the judge to sentence
the mother of Marie-Claire Chevalier

1327
01:10:44,791 --> 01:10:46,291
to three years of prison.

1328
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:48,916
Three other women risk prison as well...

1329
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,833
The backstreet abortionist

1330
01:10:51,916 --> 01:10:55,291
and two friends
who helped pay for the illegal act.

1331
01:10:55,375 --> 01:10:58,125
So it's now up to counselor
Gisèle Halimi...

1332
01:10:58,208 --> 01:11:00,500
This is Gisèle Halimi's defense speech!

1333
01:11:00,583 --> 01:11:02,666
-Of course!
-We can't miss this!

1334
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:04,958
I know, but they won't let us in.

1335
01:11:05,041 --> 01:11:07,916
Let us in! The hearing is public!

1336
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,750
I have an idea. Excuse me, sorry!

1337
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:12,375
Pardon, excuse me.

1338
01:11:13,291 --> 01:11:15,041
Excuse me, sir.

1339
01:11:15,125 --> 01:11:16,791
Hello, excuse me. I'm a lawyer.

1340
01:11:16,875 --> 01:11:18,750
This pregnant woman is my client.

1341
01:11:18,833 --> 01:11:20,041
-We need to get in.
-No.

1342
01:11:21,875 --> 01:11:23,416
What about for 50 francs?

1343
01:11:25,291 --> 01:11:27,000
-Do you have 50?
-Yes.

1344
01:11:29,458 --> 01:11:31,625
If you have permission, that's different.

1345
01:11:34,333 --> 01:11:36,791
-You're incredible!
-I get it from my mother.

1346
01:11:36,875 --> 01:11:39,125
I identify with Mrs. Chevalier,

1347
01:11:39,208 --> 01:11:41,541
with the three women present
in the hearing.

1348
01:11:41,625 --> 01:11:43,791
with the women marching in the street

1349
01:11:43,875 --> 01:11:45,666
and with millions of French women.

1350
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:48,958
They're my family, their struggle is mine.

1351
01:11:49,041 --> 01:11:51,333
They're my daily practice.

1352
01:11:51,416 --> 01:11:54,083
It's always the same class, poor women,

1353
01:11:54,166 --> 01:11:56,875
vulnerable, not in a relationship.

1354
01:11:57,875 --> 01:12:00,208
I've been defending them for 20 years.

1355
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:05,333
I've yet to defend
an important politician,

1356
01:12:05,416 --> 01:12:10,166
or the wife of a famous doctor,
or lawyer, or of a CEO,

1357
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:12,791
or one of their mistresses.

1358
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:15,750
Because you always sentence the same ones,

1359
01:12:16,625 --> 01:12:17,916
the Mrs. Chevaliers.

1360
01:12:19,083 --> 01:12:20,750
Now that's a defense speech!

1361
01:12:20,833 --> 01:12:25,000
Take a woman who find herself pregnant
because her contraception fails.

1362
01:12:25,083 --> 01:12:27,208
Suppose we forget to take our pill.

1363
01:12:27,291 --> 01:12:29,708
Yes, we can forget our pill.

1364
01:12:29,791 --> 01:12:31,708
Suppose we make a mistake.

1365
01:12:31,791 --> 01:12:34,250
A mistake in the choice of contraception.

1366
01:12:34,666 --> 01:12:36,458
Or the position of the diaphragm.

1367
01:12:36,541 --> 01:12:39,958
Failure. Error. Forgetfulness.

1368
01:12:40,041 --> 01:12:43,708
Do you want to force women
to create life through failure?

1369
01:12:43,791 --> 01:12:45,875
Through error? Through forgetfulness?

1370
01:12:46,625 --> 01:12:49,875
There are young women
who see their pregnancy through,

1371
01:12:49,958 --> 01:12:51,750
for complex reasons,

1372
01:12:51,833 --> 01:12:54,958
but let's say
it's because they respect the law.

1373
01:12:55,041 --> 01:12:57,250
Article 317.

1374
01:12:57,333 --> 01:12:59,416
They see it through to the end.

1375
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,250
What do we do for them?

1376
01:13:01,333 --> 01:13:03,083
We call them whores.

1377
01:13:03,583 --> 01:13:06,875
Never mind the fact that
they have to abandon their studies.

1378
01:13:06,958 --> 01:13:11,041
It's true repression
that befalls single mothers.

1379
01:13:11,125 --> 01:13:14,166
This law, gentlemen, cannot survive

1380
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:18,333
because it fundamentally
goes against women's liberation,

1381
01:13:18,416 --> 01:13:20,500
who have always been oppressed.

1382
01:13:20,958 --> 01:13:24,125
Women were slaves even
before slavery was born.

1383
01:13:24,208 --> 01:13:26,458
When Christianity became a state religion,

1384
01:13:26,541 --> 01:13:29,500
women became the "demon," the "temptress."

1385
01:13:30,125 --> 01:13:33,375
-In the Middle Ages, women were nothing.
-That's true.

1386
01:13:33,458 --> 01:13:36,416
And despite the Revolution,
when women emerged to speak

1387
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:38,708
and go to the barricade,

1388
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:42,666
they still weren't full human beings.

1389
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:43,916
She couldn't even vote.

1390
01:13:44,458 --> 01:13:47,750
In the Industrial Age,
when women became workers,

1391
01:13:47,833 --> 01:13:50,291
she was exploited, as were all workers.

1392
01:13:50,375 --> 01:13:52,708
But exploitation that workers suffer

1393
01:13:52,791 --> 01:13:57,000
is in addition to the overexploitation
of women by men.

1394
01:13:57,083 --> 01:13:58,916
And this, in every social class.

1395
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,916
Women are more than exploited.
They are overexploited.

1396
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,291
And oppression, as Simone de Beauvoir
said recently...

1397
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:07,833
It's Simone de Beauvoir.

1398
01:14:07,916 --> 01:14:10,125
-...isn't only about the economy.
-Hi.

1399
01:14:11,375 --> 01:14:12,500
I love what you do.

1400
01:14:12,583 --> 01:14:16,166
Oppression is an age-old strategy
upheld over centuries

1401
01:14:16,250 --> 01:14:20,500
to submit women to men,
housewives or courtesans.

1402
01:14:21,125 --> 01:14:22,208
Are you okay?

1403
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:24,416
Yes, it's what she's saying, it's so...

1404
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:28,208
Did you know, gentlemen,
that in the preamble to the Civil Code,

1405
01:14:28,333 --> 01:14:31,666
the authors wrote this,
the entire destiny of women.

1406
01:14:32,666 --> 01:14:36,708
"Woman is given to man
so she can make children.

1407
01:14:36,791 --> 01:14:41,375
"She is therefore her property
as a fruit tree belongs to a gardener."

1408
01:14:41,833 --> 01:14:42,791
That's Napoleon.

1409
01:14:42,875 --> 01:14:45,500
Look at yourselves, and look at us.

1410
01:14:45,583 --> 01:14:48,666
Four women appearing before four men.

1411
01:14:49,625 --> 01:14:51,958
Would you agree, gentlemen,

1412
01:14:52,041 --> 01:14:56,958
to appear before a tribunal of women
for the right to control your own body?

1413
01:14:57,041 --> 01:14:58,916
That would be insane!

1414
01:15:00,125 --> 01:15:02,916
Gentlemen, accepting
that we are so alienated,

1415
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,375
accepting that we don't have
a right to control our bodies

1416
01:15:06,458 --> 01:15:11,000
would be accepting, gentlemen,
that we are no more than boxes,

1417
01:15:11,083 --> 01:15:14,958
receptacles in which we sow by surprise,

1418
01:15:15,875 --> 01:15:17,875
by mistake, by ignorance,

1419
01:15:18,583 --> 01:15:21,041
in which we sow sperm.

1420
01:15:22,458 --> 01:15:23,583
I'm going into labor!

1421
01:15:27,291 --> 01:15:28,916
Go on, continue!

1422
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,541
Act like we're not here!

1423
01:15:31,666 --> 01:15:33,375
Come on, Françoise, let's go!

1424
01:15:34,291 --> 01:15:35,375
The baby's coming!

1425
01:15:35,458 --> 01:15:39,166
No, the baby's not coming.
You give birth in five days in Paris.

1426
01:15:39,958 --> 01:15:42,000
-Come on, hold it in.
-I can't.

1427
01:15:42,083 --> 01:15:44,541
-Squeeze your legs!
-Oh, no! It's coming!

1428
01:15:44,958 --> 01:15:46,250
The baby's coming!

1429
01:15:48,541 --> 01:15:51,708
This is my fault!
Why did I bring you in here?

1430
01:15:51,791 --> 01:15:54,208
You should've stayed
outside the courthouse.

1431
01:15:55,791 --> 01:15:56,833
Help me!

1432
01:15:56,916 --> 01:15:59,125
I'm not gonna deliver myself!

1433
01:15:59,208 --> 01:16:02,958
This isn't happening.
I'm gonna be born on the floor in Bobigny!

1434
01:16:05,791 --> 01:16:06,833
I see my head!

1435
01:16:12,458 --> 01:16:14,708
Charlie, I love you.

1436
01:16:18,625 --> 01:16:20,750
It's 7:30, you're listening to RFM.

1437
01:16:20,833 --> 01:16:23,208
It's March 8. No, it's not Groundhog Day,

1438
01:16:23,291 --> 01:16:26,333
it's International Women's Day,
so, ladies, enjoy.

1439
01:16:46,625 --> 01:16:47,833
I love you, too.

1440
01:16:50,041 --> 01:16:52,208
I'm fine, just talking to a statue.

1441
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,541
I'm on the blue bridge!

1442
01:16:57,625 --> 01:17:00,250
I tried calling you,
but you didn't answer.

1443
01:17:00,333 --> 01:17:01,750
I don't have a phone.

1444
01:17:01,833 --> 01:17:04,250
-Find anything?
-No, you're right. He's guilty.

1445
01:17:04,333 --> 01:17:06,333
I know, but we need to defend him.

1446
01:17:06,875 --> 01:17:09,833
Do you know why this bridge
is called Marie-Claire?

1447
01:17:10,708 --> 01:17:14,541
Yes, because she was charged
with having an abortion,

1448
01:17:14,625 --> 01:17:16,541
-and then...
-You don't know.

1449
01:17:16,625 --> 01:17:17,708
No, I don't know.

1450
01:17:17,791 --> 01:17:20,875
Well, I feel bad about this,
but it's settled. Here

1451
01:17:20,958 --> 01:17:22,708
-your case.
-What?

1452
01:17:23,625 --> 01:17:25,375
No, you have to try the case!

1453
01:17:25,458 --> 01:17:26,875
You're gonna be great!

1454
01:17:31,458 --> 01:17:33,125
Yes, hello, it's Bertrand.

1455
01:17:33,208 --> 01:17:34,750
We have a little problem.

1456
01:17:36,708 --> 01:17:37,833
Hello!

1457
01:17:42,208 --> 01:17:44,916
Hey, Charlie! You can't ditch this client.

1458
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,583
I'm not. He has a great lawyer.

1459
01:17:48,625 --> 01:17:51,750
And thanks to you, he'll be convicted.

1460
01:17:51,958 --> 01:17:54,416
Because he's a rapist, let's not forget.

1461
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:03,625
And don't forget, because those who forget
the past are condemned to relive it.

1462
01:18:03,708 --> 01:18:04,833
Who said that?

1463
01:18:07,291 --> 01:18:09,875
-The toilets?
-No! Winston Churchill!

1464
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:13,458
OUT OF SERVICE

1465
01:18:13,541 --> 01:18:15,375
After you, esteemed colleague.

1466
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,208
Seriously?

1467
01:18:31,375 --> 01:18:34,333
It's stuck! Let me out, I have a hearing!

1468
01:18:39,125 --> 01:18:40,291
Here, your seat...

1469
01:18:45,083 --> 01:18:47,041
-Who are you?
-Counsel Leroy.

1470
01:18:47,125 --> 01:18:48,625
I'm replacing your lawyer.

1471
01:18:48,708 --> 01:18:50,708
Court is in session, please be seated.

1472
01:18:51,625 --> 01:18:54,625
-We'll proceed with drawing jurors.
-That's the wrong side!

1473
01:18:56,375 --> 01:18:59,416
Everything's fine.
The opposing lawyer is very nice.

1474
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:03,083
-Juror 15.
-And he's terrible.

1475
01:19:03,166 --> 01:19:04,625
Miss Axelle Schneider.

1476
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:10,291
-Juror 12, Mr. Daniel Roskis.
-That's my daughter.

1477
01:19:11,583 --> 01:19:13,166
Juror 12, take a seat.

1478
01:19:15,166 --> 01:19:19,208
Juror 14, Mrs. Mauricette Sainte-Rose.

1479
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:24,416
There isn't much to say,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

1480
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:27,875
This man raped a woman.
He knows it, I know it.

1481
01:19:27,958 --> 01:19:29,625
You know it, and his lawyer...

1482
01:19:31,416 --> 01:19:35,333
His lawyer will argue the contrary,
but that won't change anything.

1483
01:19:35,416 --> 01:19:37,375
You have to convict him for his crime.

1484
01:19:37,458 --> 01:19:40,375
Because, yes, rape is a crime in France.

1485
01:19:40,458 --> 01:19:42,291
Since 1980, anyway.

1486
01:19:42,375 --> 01:19:47,375
Thanks to one woman's fighting spirit,
a lawyer named Gisèle Halimi.

1487
01:19:49,208 --> 01:19:53,166
And it's important not to forget
that before,

1488
01:19:53,875 --> 01:19:56,166
raping a woman was only a misdemeanor.

1489
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,458
Before, this man would never
have seen the inside of a courtroom.

1490
01:20:00,541 --> 01:20:02,541
He wouldn't even have been worried.

1491
01:20:02,625 --> 01:20:05,875
The victim would have been blamed.

1492
01:20:06,416 --> 01:20:10,333
Of course, this is only this man's trial.

1493
01:20:10,416 --> 01:20:12,750
But if he's sitting here today at all

1494
01:20:13,416 --> 01:20:15,833
it's due to a long journey

1495
01:20:16,375 --> 01:20:19,000
toward freedom and respect for women.

1496
01:20:19,291 --> 01:20:24,416
A long road paved by the fights of men
and women who are watching you now.

1497
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:26,666
Yes, ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

1498
01:20:26,750 --> 01:20:30,750
I'm sure that, wherever they are,
they're watching you.

1499
01:20:30,833 --> 01:20:32,958
The Joans, the Olympes,

1500
01:20:33,041 --> 01:20:35,750
the Nicolases, the Georges, the Maries,

1501
01:20:35,833 --> 01:20:37,791
the Simones, the Gisèles, and...

1502
01:20:40,041 --> 01:20:41,291
and the Françoises.

1503
01:20:46,041 --> 01:20:47,583
They're all watching you.

1504
01:20:47,666 --> 01:20:49,500
Awaiting your verdict.

1505
01:20:49,583 --> 01:20:51,583
Don't disappoint them.

1506
01:20:51,666 --> 01:20:54,916
Fear must finally switch sides.

1507
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,416
It's your responsibility

1508
01:20:57,500 --> 01:21:01,375
to put this predator where he can
no longer hurt anyone.

1509
01:21:02,333 --> 01:21:05,041
Which is why we are asking

1510
01:21:05,125 --> 01:21:07,041
-for 15 years of prison...
-Thank you.

1511
01:21:07,125 --> 01:21:09,500
-...for this dangerous individual.
-Oh, no.

1512
01:21:09,583 --> 01:21:11,583
I left my notes in the the file!

1513
01:21:12,541 --> 01:21:13,958
-What?
-Huh?

1514
01:21:14,125 --> 01:21:15,666
The defense has the floor.

1515
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:17,375
Nothing! Everything's fine.

1516
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:27,958
This is a thong.

1517
01:21:28,041 --> 01:21:31,166
A thong similar to the one
the victim was wearing

1518
01:21:31,250 --> 01:21:32,625
on the night in question.

1519
01:21:32,708 --> 01:21:37,666
And this thong demonstrates the intentions
of this woman when she met with my client.

1520
01:21:38,791 --> 01:21:43,500
When a woman wears this type
of undergarment, it's for one reason.

1521
01:21:44,083 --> 01:21:45,458
Right, ladies?

1522
01:21:46,958 --> 01:21:47,916
To seduce,

1523
01:21:49,416 --> 01:21:50,833
please, entice,

1524
01:21:50,916 --> 01:21:53,583
excite, turn on... Call it what you will.

1525
01:21:54,541 --> 01:21:58,166
But what's undeniable is that this thong
is proof of consent.

1526
01:21:58,833 --> 01:22:02,416
-I can't allow my colleague say that!
-You had your time.

1527
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:04,083
The defense has the floor.

1528
01:22:04,166 --> 01:22:06,250
Now, quiet, or I'll have you removed.

1529
01:22:06,333 --> 01:22:08,000
-So, this...
-No!

1530
01:22:08,083 --> 01:22:11,958
Women have been quiet for too long,
and I'm shocked to hear such language

1531
01:22:12,041 --> 01:22:14,958
today, and in this courtroom, in Bobigny!

1532
01:22:15,041 --> 01:22:16,083
Counselor!

1533
01:22:16,458 --> 01:22:19,333
And you, Your Honor,
you shouldn't let it stand.

1534
01:22:19,416 --> 01:22:22,041
This will have consequences,
and you know it!

1535
01:22:22,125 --> 01:22:23,041
Counselor Leroy!

1536
01:22:23,125 --> 01:22:24,000
As I was...

1537
01:22:24,083 --> 01:22:26,333
Our actions today
will make history tomorrow.

1538
01:22:26,416 --> 01:22:28,750
We can't let this go
in the wrong direction.

1539
01:22:28,833 --> 01:22:30,291
Last warning!

1540
01:22:31,208 --> 01:22:34,791
No, the direction of history,
Your Honor, is simple.

1541
01:22:34,875 --> 01:22:37,625
This woman wanted to have
relations with my client,

1542
01:22:37,708 --> 01:22:40,166
so she chose a red lace thong.

1543
01:22:40,250 --> 01:22:42,083
Is this thong evidence?

1544
01:22:42,166 --> 01:22:43,125
Counselor Leroy!

1545
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:46,666
It was never officially recorded,
so it's not admissible!

1546
01:22:46,750 --> 01:22:51,833
And even if it was, I can tell you
that this isn't a red lace thong.

1547
01:22:52,666 --> 01:22:56,833
-So, what...
-It's a coral lace thong.

1548
01:22:56,916 --> 01:22:58,166
How do I know?

1549
01:22:58,250 --> 01:23:02,000
Well, because today I'm wearing...

1550
01:23:02,958 --> 01:23:04,166
a lace thong...

1551
01:23:04,958 --> 01:23:06,458
that is actually red.

1552
01:23:09,208 --> 01:23:13,333
And believe me, I have no intention
of sleeping with my colleague

1553
01:23:13,416 --> 01:23:15,416
or any of you.

1554
01:23:15,833 --> 01:23:18,125
In any case, gentlemen,

1555
01:23:18,208 --> 01:23:21,708
if we follow the brilliant idea
of this lawyer, well...

1556
01:23:23,125 --> 01:23:25,375
you can all rape me.

1557
01:23:25,458 --> 01:23:27,041
With no consequences.

1558
01:23:27,125 --> 01:23:28,666
Since I'm wearing a thong,

1559
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:31,958
that means I consent to
any sexual relation.

1560
01:23:33,041 --> 01:23:38,125
Is that clear, or do I have to take it off
and wave it around like my colleague,

1561
01:23:38,208 --> 01:23:40,541
so you'll understand
that this isn't consent?

1562
01:23:46,583 --> 01:23:47,750
That's my daughter!

1563
01:23:57,250 --> 01:23:58,750
-Mom!
-Charlie! Honey!

1564
01:23:58,833 --> 01:24:01,041
Oh, Mom! I missed you so much.

1565
01:24:01,125 --> 01:24:02,750
Since last night, my dear?

1566
01:24:03,083 --> 01:24:05,583
You we wonderful! I'm so proud of you.

1567
01:24:05,666 --> 01:24:07,583
No, I'm proud of you!

1568
01:24:07,666 --> 01:24:09,833
Tonight, I'm coming over for dinner.

1569
01:24:09,916 --> 01:24:11,541
And I'll even stay and eat.

1570
01:24:12,833 --> 01:24:16,000
Well, I'll leave you to it
and go get dinner ready.

1571
01:24:17,625 --> 01:24:18,958
-I'm so clumsy.
-Hey!

1572
01:24:23,541 --> 01:24:26,750
You're fired!
And I'll make sure no firm ever hires you!

1573
01:24:26,833 --> 01:24:30,083
You can't fire me, I quit.
I'm starting my own firm.

1574
01:24:30,166 --> 01:24:32,541
-You have no clients.
-Yes, I do. Yours!

1575
01:24:33,333 --> 01:24:36,833
We'll see who prefers
an old nag to a young horse.

1576
01:24:38,083 --> 01:24:39,291
I'm quitting, too!

1577
01:24:44,083 --> 01:24:45,750
Why did you quit?

1578
01:24:45,833 --> 01:24:46,958
I have no idea.

1579
01:24:47,916 --> 01:24:49,333
Bertrand...

1580
01:24:50,541 --> 01:24:51,500
Charlie.

1581
01:24:51,583 --> 01:24:53,583
-Yes?
-I have to tell you something.

1582
01:24:53,666 --> 01:24:54,583
What?

1583
01:24:54,666 --> 01:24:57,791
-We've worked together for a while now.
-Yes.

1584
01:24:57,875 --> 01:25:01,250
-What you did today was truly remarkable.
-Thank you.

1585
01:25:12,791 --> 01:25:14,250
What are you doing?

1586
01:25:16,166 --> 01:25:18,583
Did you think this was a romantic comedy?

1587
01:25:18,666 --> 01:25:22,250
That this would end with "they got married
and had lots of children"?

1588
01:25:22,333 --> 01:25:23,916
No, wait...

1589
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:26,583
Yeah, maybe I got carried away.

1590
01:25:26,666 --> 01:25:28,125
Yes, you did.

1591
01:25:28,708 --> 01:25:31,958
Let's go, I'll drop you off at the office,
collect my things,

1592
01:25:32,958 --> 01:25:35,166
and you can try to get your job back.

1593
01:25:35,250 --> 01:25:37,125
-Good idea.
-Bertrand...

1594
01:25:39,541 --> 01:25:41,083
I should move out here.

1595
01:25:41,166 --> 01:25:43,333
Here? You wouldn't last a week.

1596
01:25:43,416 --> 01:25:46,916
Come on. Do you think
there's a mugger on every corner here?

1597
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,250
-I don't know!
-My car's been stolen!

1598
01:25:49,333 --> 01:25:50,416
Oh, no!

1599
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:53,166
No, you parked
in a handicapped spot again.

1600
01:25:53,250 --> 01:25:55,958
Who do you think I am?
It wasn't a handicapped spot.

1601
01:25:56,041 --> 01:25:58,416
-It was a delivery spot.
-You still got towed.

1602
01:25:58,500 --> 01:25:59,416
Taxi!

1603
01:26:03,666 --> 01:26:05,583
We can always take the subway.

1604
01:26:05,666 --> 01:26:07,250
The subway!

1605
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:10,125
He's crazy. No, I'm not taking the subway.

1606
01:26:10,208 --> 01:26:12,291
Taxi! I never take the subway.

1607
01:26:12,958 --> 01:26:15,208
You should. It's easier.

1608
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:16,958
And more ecological.

1609
01:26:18,166 --> 01:26:20,375
Well, I don't care about ecology.

1610
01:26:20,458 --> 01:26:22,958
-I don't pollute.
-You don't care about ecology?

1611
01:26:24,166 --> 01:26:25,291
Really?

1612
01:26:25,708 --> 01:26:28,000
-Winston Churchill once said...
-No!

1613
01:26:29,583 --> 01:26:33,208
One isn't born a woman; one becomes one.

1614
01:26:33,291 --> 01:26:37,833
Simone de Beauvoir
The Second Sex

1615
01:26:37,916 --> 01:26:41,166
One isn't born a feminist;
one becomes one. Charlie

1616
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,416
Damn it, I'm pregnant!

1617
01:27:43,333 --> 01:27:44,625
And it's Napoleon's!

1618
01:27:51,583 --> 01:27:54,208
A film inspired by true stories.

1619
01:27:54,291 --> 01:27:55,791
For real.

1620
01:28:40,416 --> 01:28:42,208
THIS IS NOT A YES

1621
01:28:48,083 --> 01:28:50,750
NO MATTER HOW NAKED YOU ARE
ASK FOR CONSENT

1622
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:23,458
# This is not consent

1623
01:29:39,583 --> 01:29:42,958
Article 2: All women wishing

of a medical officer's legal signature,

1628
01:29:53,791 --> 01:29:57,791
and furthermore, with confirmation
from the mayors or police commissioners

1629
01:29:57,875 --> 01:30:01,916

1634
