The looks they used

510
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:54,875
Yeah, Pritti.
Me, being a drag queen,

511
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:56,708
in Sheffield,
is exactly like that.

512
00:22:56,791 --> 00:22:58,666

517
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:06,625
High heels.

518
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:08,875
-(laughs softly)
-So we're still friends, yeah?

519
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:11,291
Bezzy friends, #4eva.

520
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:12,625
Oh, thank God.

521
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:14,333
I mean, Allah, or whatever.

522
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:16,041
Well, well, well.

523
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:18,250
If it isn't Tweedle Dum
and Tweedle Bummer.

524
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:19,875
-I got a joke for you, Jamie.
-(sighs)

525
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:21,791
-What's gay and says ow?
-I don't know.

526
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:23,500
Ow! Get lost, Dean.

527
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:24,833
I've got better things to do.

528
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:26,750
Oh. And what about you?

529
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:28,416
You got better things to do,

530
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,500
you fat sweaty, swotty, spotty,
speccy, piggy virgin?

531
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:33,791
Don't you dare call her that.

532
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:36,000
Why? It's what she is.

533
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,083
Just like you're
a gay, gay, gay, gay,

534
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,125
gay, gay, gay, gay...

535
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:43,625
...gay boy.

536
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:45,708
Yeah, Dean, I'm gay.

537
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:48,000
I am gay.

538
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:50,500
So if I call me gay,

539
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:53,666
then being called gay
in't an insult, is it?

540
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,958
'Cause I am bent,

541
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:57,625
and I am queer,

542
00:23:57,708 --> 00:23:59,250
and I am a faggot batty bum boy,

543
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:01,250

micro-dick scrounger,

544
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:03,375

-(boys laughing)

547
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,083
That's not what Becca says.

548
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:14,833
Stuff you, Jamie New.

549
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:17,958
Oh, my days, look at you.

-You're amazing.

551
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,333
You're fearless.

552
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:22,083

553
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:23,791

554
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:25,833

555
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:28,166

00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:31,541
-Kill me now.
-Jamie, wait a minute.

558
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:34,166
-Why?
-Just wait.

559
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:42,041

to say you're sorry.

654

I'm sick of covering for you.

00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:51,458
that his own dad
doesn't want to see him?

658
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:54,500
Happy birthday, Jamie. Surprise.

Oh, don't you just.

Oh.

672
00:30:26,083 --> 00:30:28,916
He don't wanna do
any of the things I wanna do.

673
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,875

wanting to do boy's things, eh?

675
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:39,083
It's not fair.

676
00:30:39,166 --> 00:30:43,541
We tried and tried

We're just reminiscing

681

What'd you have to say that for?

682
00:31:00,916 --> 00:31:03,333
I'll not hear
the last of it now.

683
00:31:03,416 --> 00:31:05,000
Well, I've gotta hand it to her.

684
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:08,458
I could never whip you
into shape like that.

685
00:31:08,541 --> 00:31:11,416
She's even driving you around
in your brand-new car.

686
00:31:13,041 --> 00:31:15,083
You're literally
in the passenger seat.

687

You think you know it all,
don't you?

688
00:31:22,041 --> 00:31:24,958
Well, I'll tell you something
you don't know:

689
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:27,291
Cheryl's pregnant.

690
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:29,833
We're having a boy.

691
00:31:29,916 --> 00:31:31,291
Jamie's 16.

692
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:32,708
I've done my duty.

693

why do you want
to be a drag queen?

799
00:36:20,208 --> 00:36:22,291
I dunno, I just do.

800
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:23,583
You just do.

801
00:36:23,666 --> 00:36:25,625
Oh, that's some inspiring
stuff there.

802
00:36:25,708 --> 00:36:27,250
Put that on a fridge magnet,
why don't you?

803
00:36:27,333 --> 00:36:29,375
Bloody hell.

804
00:36:29,458 --> 00:36:33,125
Because I can't really ever
imagine doing anything else.

805
00:36:33,208 --> 00:36:36,416
Because it's all I dream of.

806
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,166
It's all I live for

807
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:41,583
and when I close me eyes,
it's all I can see.

808
00:36:42,625 --> 00:36:45,166
I don't want to be a drag queen.

809
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:48,166

-So...

817
00:37:08,625 --> 00:37:09,958

818
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:11,333

822

-Six weeks.
-Six weeks?

823
00:37:19,416 --> 00:37:22,208
All right, well, that's tough

824
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:25,083
but not impossible.

825
00:37:25,166 --> 00:37:28,125

<i>Please, Pritti.</i>

1261
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:26,916
I need you.

1262
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,416
PRITTI (over phone):
I'm sorry.

1263
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:29,750
I've asked. I've begged.

1264
00:57:29,833 --> 00:57:30,916
But he says no.

1265
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,416
You're a distraction
from me revision,

1266
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,041
and I've got to stay in me room.

1267
00:57:34,125 --> 00:57:35,291
So climb out the window.

1268
00:57:35,375 --> 00:57:36,666
Yeah, I think that's

1269
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:38,416
the kind of distraction
he's talking about.

1270
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,416
I've got to go. Good luck.

1271
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,041
Oh, my God, it's Dean Paxton.

1272
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,291
Shit.

1273
00:57:43,375 --> 00:57:45,708
All right, freak show.

1274
00:57:45,791 --> 00:57:47,708
What did you say?

1275
00:57:47,791 --> 00:57:50,583
I said you are a freak.

1276
00:57:50,666 --> 00:57:52,375
No, I'm not.

1277
00:57:52,458 --> 00:57:55,541
You put on a dress and a wig
and makeup.

1278
00:57:55,625 --> 00:57:58,166
You look like a freak.

1279
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:01,166
Like a dirty, ugly freak.

1280
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:03,250
So, uh...

1281
00:58:03,333 --> 00:58:05,083
break a leg.

1282
00:58:06,458 --> 00:58:07,916

Talentless? Talentless?

1286
00:58:16,333 --> 00:58:18,041
They call me
the Great Wall of China

1287
00:58:18,125 --> 00:58:20,583
because my talent
goes on and on.

1288
00:58:20,666 --> 00:58:22,250
They call you
the Great Wall of China

1289
00:58:22,333 --> 00:58:23,833
'cause they can see you
from space.

1290

1292
00:58:28,125 --> 00:58:29,958
I'm so out of shape.

1293
00:58:30,041 --> 00:58:32,041
No, darling, never.

1294
00:58:32,125 --> 00:58:33,708
Round is a shape.

1295
00:58:33,791 --> 00:58:35,208
-Assholes.

Uh-oh.

1298
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:44,416
And where in the name of Cher
do you think you're going?

1299
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:45,791
Hugo?

1300
00:58:45,875 --> 00:58:47,333
Who the bloody hell's Hugo?

1301
00:58:47,416 --> 00:58:49,750
I'm Loco Chanelle.

1302
00:58:49,833 --> 00:58:51,166
Now, get in here!

1303
00:58:52,333 --> 00:58:54,083
Now!

1304
00:58:55,791 --> 00:58:56,916
(sighs)

1305
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,916
LOCO CHANELLE:
Good evening, goddesses.

1306
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,791
-Oh!
-Oh, there she is.

1307
00:59:00,875 --> 00:59:03,291
May I present...

1308
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:07,166
...to you the future.

1309
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:09,000
The <i>futura.</i>

1310
00:59:09,083 --> 00:59:10,916
This is...

1311
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
What's your drag name?

1312
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:17,166
I still don't have one.

1313
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:20,375
Hey, please, can I have a word
in private, Hugo?

1314
00:59:20,458 --> 00:59:23,291
Don't mind us.
We're not listening.

1315
00:59:24,333 --> 00:59:25,458
I screwed it.

1316
00:59:25,541 --> 00:59:27,500
I swear I meant to keep
the show a secret,

1317
00:59:27,583 --> 00:59:31,375
but I blurted it out, and now
they're all here from school.

1318
00:59:31,458 --> 00:59:33,625
Dean Paxton with
a bunch of his mates.

1319
00:59:33,708 --> 00:59:35,416
I can't go on.

1320
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,708
A drag queen doesn't know
the meaning of the word "can't."

1321
00:59:37,791 --> 00:59:39,916
Just ask my seven ex-husbands.

1322
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,458
No, I'm stupid.
I'm wasting your time.

1323
00:59:41,541 --> 00:59:43,375
I've got no name.

1324
00:59:43,458 --> 00:59:45,708
I've got no tits,
and I've got no eyebrows.

1325
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,791
For God sakes,
I'll do your eyebrows,

1326
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:49,541
I'll make you look beautiful,

1327
00:59:49,625 --> 00:59:51,583
and you can borrow some tits
from the tit box.

1328
00:59:51,666 --> 00:59:52,833
You're not listening to me.

1329
00:59:52,916 --> 00:59:54,500
It's Dean Paxton.

1330
00:59:54,583 --> 00:59:55,916
I can't go on.

1331
00:59:56,958 --> 00:59:59,166
Girls, a moment, please.

1332
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:01,166
Oh, pretty please.

1333
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:02,791
One, two, three four,
get to walking.

1334
01:00:02,875 --> 01:00:04,625

1562
01:10:31,958 --> 01:10:35,000
Freak show, freak show,
freak show.

1563
01:10:36,541 --> 01:10:38,625
Like that word will ever
bring me down.

1564
01:10:40,375 --> 01:10:43,250
'Cause I'm fabulous, Dean.

1565
01:10:43,333 --> 01:10:45,333
And you might be fit,

1566
01:10:45,416 --> 01:10:48,375
and you might be handsome,

1567
01:10:48,458 --> 01:10:50,958
but you're so ugly.

1568
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:55,958
I'll see you at prom, Dean.

1569
01:10:56,041 --> 01:10:57,791
I'm picking out a dress
just for you.

1570
01:10:57,875 --> 01:10:59,875
(grunting)

1571
01:10:59,958 --> 01:11:01,250
HEDGE:
Break it up!

1572
01:11:01,333 --> 01:11:03,458
Break... break it up!

1573
01:11:03,541 --> 01:11:05,333
-Stop it! That's it!
-The pair of you!

1574
01:11:05,416 --> 01:11:07,000
Get him away from me.

1575
01:11:07,083 --> 01:11:08,916
-Where are you going?
-Home.

1576
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,416
You've got your exam, Dean.

1577
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:12,083
Screw my exams, screw you,

1578
01:11:12,166 --> 01:11:13,750
and screw that
disgusting thing there.

1579
01:11:13,833 --> 01:11:15,250
'Cause if you're going
in a dress,

1580
01:11:15,333 --> 01:11:18,416
you won't find me
nowhere near that stupid prom.

1581
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:21,208
-(sighs)
-What's got into you, Jamie?

1582
01:11:21,291 --> 01:11:23,541
Eh? You know you can't
behave like that.

1583
01:11:23,625 --> 01:11:26,500
A drag queen don't know
the meaning of the word "can't."

1584
01:11:26,583 --> 01:11:28,916
Just ask me seven ex-husbands.

1585
01:11:29,916 --> 01:11:32,208
You, take those off.

1586
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:37,958
(door closes)

1587
01:11:39,875 --> 01:11:41,416
MASOOD:
<i>Jamie's behavior has been</i>

1588
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:44,625
utterly unacceptable, Mrs. New.

1589
01:11:44,708 --> 01:11:46,958
And I don't use
such strong words lightly.

1590
01:11:47,041 --> 01:11:49,000
It's just a bit of makeup.

1591
01:11:49,083 --> 01:11:51,166
Oh, Ray, please.

1592
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:54,500
I work shifts. I didn't see him
leave like that, but...

1593
01:11:54,583 --> 01:11:56,416
it's hardly
the end of the world.

1594
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:58,458
Well, it's the end of prom
for Dean Paxton.

1595
01:11:58,541 --> 01:12:00,458
MARGARET:
Who's Dean Paxton?

1596
01:12:00,541 --> 01:12:02,166
Dean from the drag club, eh?

1597
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:04,041
The boy who had 'em all jeering.

1598
01:12:04,125 --> 01:12:05,958
-Oh.
-He's a knob head.

1599
01:12:06,041 --> 01:12:07,750
Well, that's not
very helpful language.

1600
01:12:07,833 --> 01:12:09,541
Well, he is.

1601
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:13,125
Uh, I-I'd like to downplay
this dialogue and say to Jamie,

1602
01:12:13,208 --> 01:12:17,541
I want to encourage you to
uncover your individual, yeah?

1603
01:12:17,625 --> 01:12:21,541
I want you to interface
with the true you.

1604
01:12:24,208 --> 01:12:27,250
But is it right you want
to go to prom in a dress?

1605
01:12:28,291 --> 01:12:29,333
(whispers):
Go on.

1606
01:12:30,375 --> 01:12:32,208
Yeah.

1607
01:12:32,291 --> 01:12:33,458
RAY:
Is that a problem?

1608
01:12:36,125 --> 01:12:38,166
No, no, 'cause in this school,

1609
01:12:38,250 --> 01:12:41,416
we are, you know, promoters

1610
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:43,750
of, um, freedom of expression,
and, uh...

1611
01:12:43,833 --> 01:12:46,416
Yeah, I think what Mr. Masood
is trying to say

1612
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:48,416
is that there is a fine line

1613
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:51,166
between individuality
and disruption,

1614
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:54,375
and that you need to think
about how your actions

1615
01:12:54,458 --> 01:12:56,083
are going to affect
other people.

1616
01:12:56,166 --> 01:12:58,166
Because not everyone is
as lucky as you, Jamie.

1617
01:12:58,250 --> 01:13:01,416
For some of these kids,
prom is...

1618
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:03,916
I mean, it's their last chance
to have one amazing night,

1619
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
and I'm not gonna let you
take that from them.

1620
01:13:06,083 --> 01:13:08,458
How is Jamie taking anything
away from anyone?

1621
01:13:08,541 --> 01:13:10,541
Because some of the kids
have said they're not gonna

1622
01:13:10,625 --> 01:13:12,166
go to prom
if Jamie wears a dress.

1623
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:14,333
She means Dean Paxton.

1624
01:13:14,416 --> 01:13:15,875
You heard what he called me.

1625
01:13:15,958 --> 01:13:18,375
What? What?

1626
01:13:19,708 --> 01:13:21,625
What did Dean Paxton call him?

1627
01:13:21,708 --> 01:13:24,333
Well, I don't want
to repeat the word.

1628
01:13:24,416 --> 01:13:26,250
MARGARET:
Well, I do. I want to hear.

1629
01:13:26,333 --> 01:13:29,208
I want to know what my son's
being called at school.

1630
01:13:30,791 --> 01:13:32,708
He called him disgusting.

1631
01:13:32,791 --> 01:13:34,291
And-and we will deal with that.

1632
01:13:34,375 --> 01:13:36,916
But, Jamie, this is
gonna keep happening.

1633
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,916
Mimi Me is not a student
at this school.

1634
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,750
Jamie New is.

1635
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:44,375
And if Jamie wants to come
to prom, he comes as Jamie.

1636
01:13:44,458 --> 01:13:46,625
In a tie and-and a shirt
and trousers,

1637
01:13:46,708 --> 01:13:48,041
like all the other boys.

1638
01:13:48,125 --> 01:13:51,000
I'm sorry, but your
behavior today-- that's...

1639
01:13:51,083 --> 01:13:53,333
that's just the way
it has to be.

1640
01:13:55,166 --> 01:13:56,666
We've heard enough.

1641
01:13:56,750 --> 01:13:58,083
-(door opens)
-Jamie!

1642
01:13:58,166 --> 01:13:59,958
-(sighs)
-JAMIE: <i>Disgusting.</i>

1643
01:14:00,041 --> 01:14:02,000
How could he call
Mimi Me disgusting?

1644
01:14:02,083 --> 01:14:04,291
You know, Mimi is gorgeous,
and glamorous.

1645
01:14:04,375 --> 01:14:06,250
Look at Miss Hedge
in her knockoff Jimmy Choos.

1646
01:14:06,333 --> 01:14:07,791
-You know she's just jealous.
-Jamie.

1647
01:14:07,875 --> 01:14:09,000
Calm down.

1648
01:14:09,083 --> 01:14:10,250
Me mum and dad'll hear you.

1649
01:14:10,333 --> 01:14:12,375
I'm not supposed to have boys
in me room.

1650
01:14:12,458 --> 01:14:13,791
Oh, I'm sorry,
please hold me back

1651
01:14:13,875 --> 01:14:15,291
whilst I try not to ravish you.

1652
01:14:15,375 --> 01:14:16,916
Jamie. House rules.

1653
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,250
Come on.

1654
01:14:18,333 --> 01:14:19,500
(sighs heavily)

1655
01:14:25,791 --> 01:14:27,583
Your room's so tidy.

1656
01:14:27,666 --> 01:14:28,875
I don't know how you do it.

1657
01:14:28,958 --> 01:14:32,000
I don't have as many dresses
as you do.

1658
01:14:34,875 --> 01:14:36,666
I like your lamp.

1659
01:14:36,750 --> 01:14:38,916
Thanks.

1660
01:14:41,208 --> 01:14:43,875
Jamie, do you think...

1661
01:14:43,958 --> 01:14:46,250
Miss Hedge maybe has a point?

1662
01:14:46,333 --> 01:14:49,458
If Mimi goes to prom,
it'll only be about her.

1663
01:14:49,541 --> 01:14:51,791
Everyone else'll
be overshadowed.

1664
01:14:51,875 --> 01:14:53,416
No, everyone loves Mimi.

1665
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:56,500
They love her on a stage...

1666
01:14:56,583 --> 01:14:58,708
but in real life...

1667
01:14:58,791 --> 01:15:02,208
she can say things
that upset people.

1668
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:06,583
Why does Mimi have to be
part of the equation?

1669
01:15:06,666 --> 01:15:08,333
I'm gonna be a doctor,

1670
01:15:08,416 --> 01:15:10,250
but it doesn't mean
I have to go everywhere

1671
01:15:10,333 --> 01:15:12,041
swinging my stethoscope.

1672
01:15:12,125 --> 01:15:14,500
'Cause without Mimi, I'm...

1673
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:18,833
I'm just ugly.

1674
01:15:23,208 --> 01:15:25,125
Jamie...

1675
01:15:25,208 --> 01:15:27,375
you are stunning.

1676
01:15:30,583 --> 01:15:33,458
You know there's a name
like Jamie in Arabic.

1677
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:36,291
Jamil.

1678
01:15:36,375 --> 01:15:39,500
So if you were, like,
Pakistani or Middle Eastern

1679
01:15:39,583 --> 01:15:41,125
or whatever,

1680
01:15:41,208 --> 01:15:43,750
we'd call you Jamil New.

1681
01:15:43,833 --> 01:15:46,250
And do you know
what Jamil means?

1682
01:15:47,291 --> 01:15:50,583

Jamie.

1721
01:18:22,166 --> 01:18:24,791
Talk to me.

1722
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:38,250
Me dad...

1723
01:18:39,708 --> 01:18:45,083
...he caught me once,
dressing up.

1724
01:18:45,166 --> 01:18:47,166
The look on his face,

1725
01:18:47,250 --> 01:18:49,666
and what he said,

1726
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:53,416
has made me feel ugly
my entire life.

1727
01:18:57,041 --> 01:18:59,875
People can change.

1728
01:18:59,958 --> 01:19:02,375
I mean, he sent you flowers
for your show.

1729
01:19:02,458 --> 01:19:04,375
But he's not replying
to me texts.

1730
01:19:04,458 --> 01:19:06,166
Well, you know,
in the olden days,

1731
01:19:06,250 --> 01:19:08,750
people used to go
and actually talk to each other.

1732
01:19:08,833 --> 01:19:10,916
I can't go round.

1733
01:19:12,333 --> 01:19:14,416

1913
01:29:57,250 --> 01:29:58,958
(scoffs)

1914
01:29:59,041 --> 01:30:03,041
I'm so bloody old
and out-of-date,

1915
01:30:03,125 --> 01:30:06,208
and you, you're just...

1916
01:30:06,291 --> 01:30:07,833
new.

1917
01:30:07,916 --> 01:30:10,250
I don't know what that means.

1918
01:30:12,291 --> 01:30:13,625
I don't know who I am.

1919
01:30:13,708 --> 01:30:15,625
You're 16,
of course you don't.

1920
01:30:15,708 --> 01:30:18,041
You're still cooking.

1921
01:30:19,708 --> 01:30:23,583
Jamie, the final rule of drag

1922
01:30:23,666 --> 01:30:26,125
is that there's no such thing
as rules.

1923
01:30:26,208 --> 01:30:28,041
Do what you need to do.

1924
01:30:28,125 --> 01:30:30,416
Be who you need to be.

1925
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:33,125
Because if anyone can do it...

1926
01:30:33,208 --> 01:30:34,625
it's you.

1927
01:30:34,708 --> 01:30:37,250

1928
01:30:38,916 --> 01:30:40,500

1929
01:30:41,541 --> 01:30:43,833
You.

1930
01:30:46,916 --> 01:30:48,666
Now.

1931
01:30:48,750 --> 01:30:50,416

1932
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:53,083

1935
01:31:25,041 --> 01:31:27,500
I'm sorry, Mum.

1936
01:31:28,541 --> 01:31:30,458
I'm all right.

1937
01:31:30,541 --> 01:31:32,750
It's just a stupid thing I did.

1938
01:31:33,791 --> 01:31:35,791
I won't be doing again.

1939
01:31:37,958 --> 01:31:40,333

1940
01:31:48,208 --> 01:31:50,458
I'm sorry I lied.

1941
01:31:51,833 --> 01:31:54,416
Why did you do it?

1942
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:59,500
I didn't think it through,
did I?

1943
01:32:18,583 --> 01:32:19,916

1944
01:32:21,208 --> 01:32:25,041

-It's all right.

1945

I deserve it.

1946
01:32:28,750 --> 01:32:32,291
No, Jamie.

1947
01:32:32,375 --> 01:32:34,958
You don't deserve any of this.

1948
01:32:36,208 --> 01:32:38,791
Your dad...

1949
01:32:39,833 --> 01:32:42,833
Oh, what was I thinking
loving a man like that, eh?

1950
01:32:42,916 --> 01:32:45,125
(Jamie laughs softly)

1951
01:32:45,208 --> 01:32:48,083
Who needs a dad anyway?

1952
01:32:48,166 --> 01:32:49,916
We got Ray.

1953
01:32:51,541 --> 01:32:53,750
She's twice the man
he'll ever be.

1954
01:32:53,833 --> 01:32:55,875
And with bigger balls.

1955
01:32:58,250 --> 01:33:00,250
Mum.

1956
01:33:02,125 --> 01:33:04,791
Do you ever wish
I were just normal?

1957
01:33:04,875 --> 01:33:07,125
No.

1958
01:33:07,208 --> 01:33:09,708
Never.

1959
01:33:09,791 --> 01:33:12,625
And what's normal anyway?
This is normal for you.

1960
01:33:12,708 --> 01:33:16,333
Oh, well, if I were normal,
I could go to prom.

1961
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:18,000
If I was normal,
Dad would've stayed.

1962
01:33:19,041 --> 01:33:22,416
Your dad's an idiot.

1963
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:24,416
You've done nothing wrong,
Jamie.

1964
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:27,000
You never did.

01:33:27,083 --> 01:33:29,583

I'm sorry for him,

because he's missing out
on so much.

1968
01:33:34,791 --> 01:33:37,791
I mean, look at you, eh.

1969
01:33:38,833 --> 01:33:40,958
And you can still go
to the prom, if you want.

-What, is it contagious?
-Dean,

2045
01:37:59,958 --> 01:38:01,291
why do you have to be
such a wanker?

2046
01:38:01,375 --> 01:38:03,500
Why does she have to be such
a waccy, spaccy virgin?

2047
01:38:03,583 --> 01:38:04,750
-Dean.
-It's all right.

2048
01:38:04,833 --> 01:38:05,875
It doesn't matter.

2049
01:38:05,958 --> 01:38:08,125
What did it say?

2050
01:38:08,208 --> 01:38:09,916
I said...

2051
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,208
it doesn't matter.

2052
01:38:13,125 --> 01:38:14,916
And that's the truth, Dean.

2053
01:38:15,958 --> 01:38:18,750
What you say, what you think,

2054
01:38:18,833 --> 01:38:20,750
what you do...

2055
01:38:20,833 --> 01:38:22,708
it doesn't matter anymore.

2056
01:38:22,791 --> 01:38:25,000
No, I am not a "spac,"

2057
01:38:25,083 --> 01:38:27,166

2058
01:38:27,250 --> 01:38:31,000

2061
01:38:35,625 --> 01:38:38,791

2063
01:38:42,375 --> 01:38:46,166

01:38:47,208 --> 01:38:48,750

2065
01:38:48,833 --> 01:38:51,000
tomorrow...

2066
01:38:51,083 --> 01:38:52,333
you're nothing.

2067
01:38:52,416 --> 01:38:56,250

01:38:56,333 --> 01:38:58,083

2069
01:38:58,166 --> 01:38:59,875

2070
01:38:59,958 --> 01:39:02,333
You've got...

2071
01:39:02,416 --> 01:39:04,000
five hours left

2072
01:39:04,083 --> 01:39:06,416
of being someone
that anybody cares about,

2073
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:08,125
and that's it.

2074
01:39:08,208 --> 01:39:10,541
So call me spaccy,
if it makes you happy,

2075
01:39:10,625 --> 01:39:12,833
but enjoy it while you can,

2076
01:39:12,916 --> 01:39:15,416
because your time's almost up.

2077
01:39:16,916 --> 01:39:20,500
And, yeah, I am a virgin,

2078
01:39:20,583 --> 01:39:23,208
and I'm proud of that, too.

2079
01:39:23,291 --> 01:39:24,875
Whoa, man,
she totally nailed you.

2081
01:39:27,625 --> 01:39:30,083

a date for prom.

01:39:31,125 --> 01:39:33,125
What are you talking about?

2083
01:39:33,208 --> 01:39:35,083
I'm here with him.
