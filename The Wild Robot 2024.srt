00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,566
Hello. Bonjour.

2
00:02:02,702 --> 00:02:05,140
Guten Tag. Hujambo. Hola.

3
00:02:05,275 --> 00:02:07,010
Congratulations on your purchase

4
00:02:07,146 --> 00:02:09,505
of a Universal Dynamics robot.

5
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,512
I am Rozzum 7134.

6
00:02:12,648 --> 00:02:15,216
A Rozzum always
completes its task.

7
00:02:15,352 --> 00:02:16,815
Just ask.

8
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,788
Just ask.

9
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,132
Processing.

10
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:16,714
Do you need...

11
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:19,042
assistance?

12
00:03:32,726 --> 00:03:35,894
Ready to receive my first task.

13
00:04:03,023 --> 00:04:07,599
Rozzum 7134 is available
for task assignment.

14
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,093
Rozzum robots come standard
with the Alpha-113

15
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:14,262
dimensional processor.

16
00:04:14,397 --> 00:04:16,975
If you're unsure
about how I can assist,

17
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,573
try asking me about myself.

18
00:04:27,112 --> 00:04:28,584
Excuse me.

19
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,589
Did you know I can assist
with grocery shopping?

20
00:04:31,725 --> 00:04:32,923
Banking?

21
00:04:34,454 --> 00:04:36,559
Landscaping?

22
00:04:41,162 --> 00:04:45,465
Hello. Did you perhaps order
a Rozzum helper robot?

23
00:04:45,601 --> 00:04:47,599
Is that a no?

24
00:04:47,734 --> 00:04:49,364
Here's a free sticker.

25
00:04:49,499 --> 00:04:52,311
Scan the code and receive
ten percent off of your...

26
00:05:06,053 --> 00:05:08,618
Do you need assistance?

27
00:05:08,754 --> 00:05:10,960
I see your problem.

28
00:05:25,777 --> 00:05:28,978
Rozzums are programmed
for instant physical mimicry,

29
00:05:29,113 --> 00:05:30,712
so as to...

30
00:05:57,004 --> 00:05:59,210
Aggression detected.

31
00:05:59,345 --> 00:06:01,576
My communication package
includes

32
00:06:01,711 --> 00:06:04,845
strategies
for conflict resolution.

33
00:06:07,587 --> 00:06:10,616
Your dialect is not
in my data banks.

34
00:06:10,752 --> 00:06:13,483
Tell your people not to worry.

35
00:06:13,618 --> 00:06:18,529
Rozzum 7134 will sort out this
language barrier in no time.

36
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:25,899
Activating learning mode.

37
00:06:45,722 --> 00:06:47,788
- I say...
- Hey, check it out.

38
00:06:47,924 --> 00:06:49,919
Look, look, look.
Somebody died over here.

39
00:06:50,054 --> 00:06:51,593
Let me see. Let me see. Oh!

40
00:06:51,728 --> 00:06:52,924
- Who was it?
- Anybody we know?

41
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,592
Fresh or not fresh?

42
00:06:54,728 --> 00:06:55,793
Smells pretty good.

43
00:06:55,928 --> 00:06:57,492
Tastes terrible!

44
00:06:57,628 --> 00:06:58,760
- Oh, it's waking up.
- Hey, it's waking up.

45
00:07:00,331 --> 00:07:03,467
- It's a monster!
- Run for your lives!

46
00:07:03,602 --> 00:07:06,170
Look, that's the thing
that destroyed my dam.

47
00:07:06,305 --> 00:07:08,204
-The monster.
-Yikes!

48
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:09,845
I think it's gonna talk.

49
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,481
Thank you for your patience

50
00:07:11,617 --> 00:07:13,816
while I deciphered
your language.

51
00:07:13,951 --> 00:07:18,447
I am Rozzum 7134,
ready to enhance your lives

52
00:07:18,582 --> 00:07:21,992
with integrated multiphase
task accomplishment.

53
00:07:26,562 --> 00:07:28,260
Are you here to kill us?

54
00:07:28,396 --> 00:07:30,792
Negative. I am here to help
with whatever task you...

55
00:07:30,927 --> 00:07:32,497
It says no!

56
00:07:35,903 --> 00:07:37,099
It's dead.

57
00:07:37,234 --> 00:07:39,405
Ah, thank goodness.

58
00:07:48,347 --> 00:07:50,087
-The monster!
-The monster!

59
00:07:51,985 --> 00:07:53,820
The monster!

60
00:07:53,956 --> 00:07:56,693
Did anyone order me?

61
00:08:19,978 --> 00:08:22,180
Anyone?

62
00:08:23,982 --> 00:08:26,217
Delivery unsuccessful.

63
00:08:27,292 --> 00:08:29,491
Return to factory.

64
00:08:29,627 --> 00:08:32,794
Activating return transmitter.

65
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,260
Three, two, one.

66
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:21,406
Ow!

67
00:09:42,535 --> 00:09:44,059
Activating return transmitter.

68
00:09:44,195 --> 00:09:45,168
Three.

69
00:09:46,536 --> 00:09:48,406
- Pretty.
- Get it!

70
00:09:48,542 --> 00:09:50,532
Two.

71
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:54,276
One.

72
00:09:54,411 --> 00:09:55,477
Ha!

73
00:10:09,319 --> 00:10:11,620
Wait. Stop! No!

74
00:10:11,756 --> 00:10:14,088
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no...

75
00:10:20,933 --> 00:10:22,300
Again!

76
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:04,594
May I confirm that is yours?

77
00:13:17,174 --> 00:13:19,184
Hmm?

78
00:14:02,892 --> 00:14:05,622
Here you go. Take it.

79
00:14:15,836 --> 00:14:17,568
Ow.

80
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:44,567
Huh.

81
00:14:47,904 --> 00:14:49,699
Ow.

82
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:01,603
Was this task accomplished
to your satisfaction?

83
00:16:04,113 --> 00:16:05,677
On a scale of one to ten,

84
00:16:05,812 --> 00:16:08,677
where ten is most satisfied
and one is least,

85
00:16:08,812 --> 00:16:10,485
how would you rate
my performance?

86
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,789
I will register that as a ten.

87
00:16:13,924 --> 00:16:16,390
Returning to factory.

88
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,455
Signal strength weak.

89
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:23,025
Seeking higher ground.

90
00:16:38,982 --> 00:16:41,217
Do you require shelter?

91
00:16:52,859 --> 00:16:55,697
Perhaps tips for planning
your next vacation?

92
00:17:05,176 --> 00:17:09,238
I do not understand
this response.

93
00:17:10,682 --> 00:17:12,450
Signal acquired.

94
00:17:12,585 --> 00:17:15,552
Three, two, one.

95
00:17:24,428 --> 00:17:26,790
ANIMAL
Mom, I don't feel good.

96
00:17:26,925 --> 00:17:29,397
If I barf,
I'm taking you all with me.

97
00:17:29,532 --> 00:17:32,364
Mom told you not to eat
grasshoppers, dummy.

98
00:17:32,499 --> 00:17:34,567
Petunia's been in front all day.

99
00:17:34,703 --> 00:17:36,999
The prettiest opossum
always rides in front.

100
00:17:37,135 --> 00:17:39,703
Try being pretty with my tail
jammed in your eye.

101
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,708
Bartlett!

102
00:17:42,843 --> 00:17:44,713
Stop jamming your tail
in your sister's eye.

103
00:17:44,849 --> 00:17:45,815
I'm Rowan.

104
00:17:45,951 --> 00:17:47,408
Bartlett was last litter.

105
00:17:47,544 --> 00:17:48,918
Are you sure?

106
00:17:49,053 --> 00:17:51,282
Who are all of you? Go away.

107
00:17:51,418 --> 00:17:53,120
We're your children.

108
00:17:53,256 --> 00:17:55,323
Except for him.

109
00:17:55,459 --> 00:17:57,620
Well, this is what I get
for taking a walk.

110
00:17:57,756 --> 00:17:59,829
Where's your mommy, little guy?

111
00:17:59,964 --> 00:18:01,456
The monster!

112
00:18:05,332 --> 00:18:06,803
You got to die faster.

113
00:18:06,939 --> 00:18:08,906
Meningitis takes a while.

114
00:18:09,042 --> 00:18:10,201
- What did you pick?
- Rabies.

115
00:18:10,337 --> 00:18:11,732
Spontaneous combustion.

116
00:18:11,868 --> 00:18:13,471
- Nightshade salad.
- Sepsis.

117
00:18:13,607 --> 00:18:15,473
Hey! I picked sepsis!

118
00:18:15,608 --> 00:18:17,440
None of you are doing it right.

119
00:18:17,575 --> 00:18:19,208
We talked about this.

120
00:18:19,344 --> 00:18:21,548
Dead things don't have to
explain why they're dead.

121
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:22,986
Now we're gonna get killed
for real.

122
00:18:23,121 --> 00:18:24,554
Sorry, Mom.

123
00:18:24,689 --> 00:18:25,923
Sorry.

124
00:18:26,058 --> 00:18:28,251
Uh, why aren't we killed yet?

125
00:18:28,387 --> 00:18:30,084
Good question.

126
00:18:36,528 --> 00:18:38,135
Nice knowing you, Mom.

127
00:18:38,271 --> 00:18:39,395
All right. It's okay.

128
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:40,767
It's okay.

129
00:18:40,903 --> 00:18:43,039
Uh, hey.

130
00:18:43,174 --> 00:18:45,466
You in there? I'm Pinktail.

131
00:18:45,601 --> 00:18:46,702
Oh, okay.

132
00:18:46,837 --> 00:18:48,174
-Wow.
- Hello.

133
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,471
Uh, this gosling is yours?

134
00:18:50,606 --> 00:18:51,906
Negative.

135
00:18:52,042 --> 00:18:54,450
That gosling stalks me,
emits noise

136
00:18:54,585 --> 00:18:58,183
and makes simple tasks
more complicated or impossible.

137
00:18:58,319 --> 00:18:59,685
Yeah, they do that.

138
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,055
Goslings imprint
on the first thing they see.

139
00:19:02,191 --> 00:19:03,517
Which would be you.

140
00:19:03,652 --> 00:19:05,286
Congratulations.

141
00:19:05,421 --> 00:19:07,825
As far as he's concerned,
you're his mother now.

142
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,667
I do not have the programming
to be a mother.

143
00:19:10,802 --> 00:19:12,164
No one does.

144
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,337
We just make it up.

145
00:19:14,472 --> 00:19:16,531
Without an assigned task,
my next priority

146
00:19:16,667 --> 00:19:18,405
is to return to factory.

147
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:22,346
Taking care of him
is your task now.

148
00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:26,380
Task acquired.
Return mode delayed.

149
00:19:26,516 --> 00:19:29,250
A Rozzum always
completes its task.

150
00:19:29,386 --> 00:19:30,853
You're lucky you just have one.

151
00:19:30,989 --> 00:19:32,554
As a mother of seven...

152
00:19:34,491 --> 00:19:37,119
...six babies,
it's a full-time thing.

153
00:19:37,254 --> 00:19:39,355
But it's not all bad.

154
00:19:41,261 --> 00:19:43,028
Just mostly bad.

155
00:19:43,164 --> 00:19:46,727
Do you have any information on
how to take care of this unit?

156
00:19:46,862 --> 00:19:48,400
They all need to eat.

157
00:19:48,535 --> 00:19:51,367
But yours needs to swim and fly.

158
00:19:51,502 --> 00:19:53,169
Oh, fly by fall.

159
00:19:53,305 --> 00:19:56,069
He's got to leave this island
before winter or...

160
00:19:56,205 --> 00:19:58,177
Uh, how do I put this
delicately?

161
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,517
Yeah. That.

162
00:20:01,653 --> 00:20:04,678
Eat, swim, fly by fall or...

163
00:20:04,814 --> 00:20:07,115
Patience is the key.

164
00:20:07,985 --> 00:20:09,922
It's okay, Mom. I'm alive.

165
00:20:10,058 --> 00:20:11,191
Oh.

166
00:20:11,326 --> 00:20:13,021
Yay.

167
00:20:13,157 --> 00:20:15,360
- Well, good luck.
-Goodbye.

168
00:20:15,495 --> 00:20:17,395
We like your new baby.

169
00:20:17,531 --> 00:20:20,099
Hope it doesn't die.

170
00:20:25,168 --> 00:20:27,443
Eat, swim, fly by fall.

171
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,814
Eat.

172
00:20:36,612 --> 00:20:38,146
Huh?

173
00:20:40,191 --> 00:20:41,523
Swim.

174
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:45,461
Whoa!

175
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,098
I say, keep your trash
out of my pond.

176
00:20:50,233 --> 00:20:51,499
That's littering.

177
00:20:51,634 --> 00:20:53,733
Not to mention murder.

178
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:56,901
Huh?

179
00:20:59,078 --> 00:21:00,206
Fly.

180
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,981
Allow me to introduce myself.

181
00:21:13,117 --> 00:21:16,117
Fink-- predator
and local goose expert.

182
00:21:16,252 --> 00:21:18,853
Which I know you could use
about now.

183
00:21:18,988 --> 00:21:20,361
You are the destroyer unit.

184
00:21:20,497 --> 00:21:22,924
It's okay. I won't eat him.

185
00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:24,527
Are you crazy? I might eat him.

186
00:21:24,663 --> 00:21:25,961
You said you would not.

187
00:21:26,097 --> 00:21:28,902
Do you believe
everything you hear?

188
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:30,071
Yes.

189
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,768
Noted.

190
00:21:32,904 --> 00:21:34,441
Why did you steal my gosling?

191
00:21:34,576 --> 00:21:36,870
I'm a fox. I do foxy things.

192
00:21:37,006 --> 00:21:38,211
It's in my nature.

193
00:21:38,346 --> 00:21:40,280
Your programming.

194
00:21:40,415 --> 00:21:41,813
Why'd you help me?

195
00:21:41,948 --> 00:21:44,355
I'm a robot.
I do robot-y things.

196
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:47,485
I seek tasks
and ensure all essential needs

197
00:21:47,621 --> 00:21:49,056
have been met or exceeded.

198
00:21:56,663 --> 00:21:58,200
I have some essential needs.

199
00:21:58,336 --> 00:21:59,333
FINK and GOSLING:
Aw.

200
00:21:59,469 --> 00:22:01,470
Fink, as a local goose expert,

201
00:22:01,606 --> 00:22:04,835
how do I get-- mmm--
to eat, swim, fly?

202
00:22:04,971 --> 00:22:08,011
I thought you'd never ask.

203
00:22:08,147 --> 00:22:10,410
Let's start with eat.

204
00:22:10,546 --> 00:22:12,779
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right there.

205
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:16,887
Hmm.

206
00:22:19,616 --> 00:22:21,151
Ow.

207
00:22:21,286 --> 00:22:22,557
I do not think
these are suitable.

208
00:22:22,692 --> 00:22:23,420
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

209
00:22:23,556 --> 00:22:25,226
Let me check.

210
00:22:25,361 --> 00:22:27,431
Mmm. Seems good to me.

211
00:22:27,567 --> 00:22:30,632
Say, can you make yourself
look like a bear?

212
00:22:33,431 --> 00:22:34,964
FINK
I'm here for a honey lunch.

213
00:22:36,575 --> 00:22:38,168
I believe I am under attack.

214
00:22:38,303 --> 00:22:40,407
- You're doing great.
- Should I be concerned?

215
00:22:40,542 --> 00:22:41,570
Sorry, can't hear you.

216
00:22:43,846 --> 00:22:46,514
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.
Here you go, kid.

217
00:22:52,517 --> 00:22:53,556
Huh?

218
00:22:56,662 --> 00:22:59,496
How do goslings
normally do this?

219
00:23:01,398 --> 00:23:03,093
Ooh.

220
00:23:04,332 --> 00:23:05,533
Mmm, mmm.

221
00:23:05,669 --> 00:23:07,200
This is not working.

222
00:23:07,335 --> 00:23:08,369
Are you kidding?

223
00:23:08,504 --> 00:23:10,435
Everything is working great.

224
00:23:11,939 --> 00:23:13,403
Oh, yeah, that.

225
00:23:13,538 --> 00:23:14,671
Here.

226
00:23:14,806 --> 00:23:16,744
Yum.

227
00:23:16,879 --> 00:23:19,540
Phase one of task is completed.

228
00:23:19,675 --> 00:23:21,877
Now, we're gonna have to do
all this over tomorrow.

229
00:23:22,013 --> 00:23:24,283
All these kids do...

230
00:23:24,418 --> 00:23:26,289
is eat.

231
00:23:26,424 --> 00:23:28,054
I understand.

232
00:23:28,189 --> 00:23:30,157
-What's that?
-My power core.

233
00:23:30,293 --> 00:23:31,893
It is damaged.

234
00:23:32,029 --> 00:23:34,890
Without it, I rely on my
solar surfaces and batteries.

235
00:23:35,026 --> 00:23:37,032
Yeah, you should work on that.

236
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:38,635
Mmm.

237
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:41,171
I also need
a replacement transmitter.

238
00:23:41,306 --> 00:23:43,640
Ugh, do I have to do everything?

239
00:23:43,776 --> 00:23:46,410
When we run across
another robot, we'll kill it

240
00:23:46,545 --> 00:23:48,578
- and take its transmitter.
- Negative.

241
00:23:48,713 --> 00:23:50,776
-  Huh?
- Rozzum inhibition protocols

242
00:23:50,911 --> 00:23:53,243
prevent deliberate harm
to others.

243
00:23:53,378 --> 00:23:57,014
Look, you need to learn
how things work on this island.

244
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:59,852
Me, the bear, everybody,

245
00:23:59,988 --> 00:24:02,151
we're all just trying
to survive.

246
00:24:02,287 --> 00:24:05,828
And kindness is not
a survival skill.

247
00:24:05,964 --> 00:24:07,221
Mmm.

248
00:24:07,356 --> 00:24:08,497
Yeah, so, uh,

249
00:24:08,632 --> 00:24:09,861
how did you get
a gosling anyway?

250
00:24:09,997 --> 00:24:11,364
There was an accident.

251
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,963
I terminated his family.

252
00:24:13,099 --> 00:24:14,528
For future reference,

253
00:24:14,663 --> 00:24:16,300
you probably want to keep
all that to yourself.

254
00:24:16,435 --> 00:24:19,776
Understood.
Do not mention dead family.

255
00:24:19,911 --> 00:24:23,904
Fink, how long do you estimate
swim and fly to take?

256
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:25,339
Swimming's easy.

257
00:24:25,475 --> 00:24:27,647
I can teach him
the way my mom taught me.

258
00:24:27,782 --> 00:24:29,619
Swim!

259
00:24:30,587 --> 00:24:32,283
-Fink.
- Hmm?

260
00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:33,919
He will not learn that way.

261
00:24:34,054 --> 00:24:36,256
Not if you keep doing that.

262
00:24:38,628 --> 00:24:40,156
Just between us,
this whole thing

263
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:42,125
might not take as long
as you think.

264
00:24:42,261 --> 00:24:44,234
Your gosling,
he isn't exactly...

265
00:24:44,369 --> 00:24:45,732
...normal.

266
00:24:45,868 --> 00:24:47,900
I have a defective baby?

267
00:24:48,036 --> 00:24:49,935
He's what they call a runt.

268
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:51,474
A runt.

269
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,209
Fact is,
even if his whole family

270
00:24:53,345 --> 00:24:54,876
hadn't have been killed,

271
00:24:55,011 --> 00:24:56,512
he probably wouldn't
have lived very long.

272
00:24:56,648 --> 00:24:58,077
- Just, I don't know...
- Whoa!

273
00:24:58,212 --> 00:24:59,907
...don't get too attached
to the little guy.

274
00:25:00,042 --> 00:25:01,518
That's all.

275
00:25:01,654 --> 00:25:03,884
If you want,
I could eat him right now

276
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:05,986
- and save you the grief later.
- Negative.

277
00:25:06,121 --> 00:25:09,853
Eating this task is not
the same as completing it.

278
00:25:09,989 --> 00:25:12,863
Ugh. So we're doing this.

279
00:25:12,998 --> 00:25:15,999
Well, if you don't want me
or anyone else to eat him,

280
00:25:16,134 --> 00:25:19,532
you're gonna need a place
that's safer than out here!

281
00:25:19,667 --> 00:25:22,369
Which is a great idea!

282
00:25:22,505 --> 00:25:24,665
New project.

283
00:25:25,972 --> 00:25:27,440
Is it normal to burp this much?

284
00:25:27,576 --> 00:25:29,914
Ooh.

285
00:25:37,614 --> 00:25:39,049
That thing's gonna fall on you.

286
00:25:39,185 --> 00:25:40,687
And squish you to jelly.

287
00:25:40,823 --> 00:25:42,218
This guy's nuts.

288
00:25:42,354 --> 00:25:43,852
-Who is that?
-Paddler?

289
00:25:43,988 --> 00:25:45,253
Local laughingstock.

290
00:25:45,388 --> 00:25:47,562
Spends every day
trying to cut down

291
00:25:47,697 --> 00:25:49,631
the biggest tree on the island.

292
00:25:49,767 --> 00:25:51,567
He's obsessed.

293
00:25:51,703 --> 00:25:53,931
Kind of like you
and your task hang-up.

294
00:25:54,066 --> 00:25:56,036
His programming.

295
00:25:56,171 --> 00:25:58,473
Hey, Paddler, you're never
gonna finish that!

296
00:25:58,609 --> 00:26:00,737
Felling this is not the point.

297
00:26:00,873 --> 00:26:03,305
The process is the art.

298
00:26:03,441 --> 00:26:05,039
And that's what happens
to your brain

299
00:26:05,175 --> 00:26:07,778
when you eat wood, weirdo.

300
00:26:07,913 --> 00:26:09,212
Yeah?

301
00:26:09,347 --> 00:26:11,113
Well, you'll eat
those words, vermin.

302
00:26:11,248 --> 00:26:12,623
Are you sure

303
00:26:12,758 --> 00:26:15,115
Paddler will not mind us
borrowing his home?

304
00:26:15,251 --> 00:26:17,122
He doesn't need to know.

305
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:21,757
Mmm.

306
00:26:21,892 --> 00:26:24,734
Hmm? Huh?

307
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,734
Seriously?

308
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:29,299
He needs room for me
and my stuff.

309
00:26:30,108 --> 00:26:31,333
Better.

310
00:26:31,469 --> 00:26:33,568
Now, you can make one
this big, right?

311
00:26:33,703 --> 00:26:38,048
No task is
impossible for Rozzum 7134.

312
00:26:38,183 --> 00:26:39,707
Roz...

313
00:26:39,843 --> 00:26:41,948
7... 34?

314
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:45,352
But you can call me Roz.

315
00:26:45,488 --> 00:26:47,015
Roz!

316
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,848
Roz, Roz, Roz, Roz...

317
00:26:48,984 --> 00:26:51,759
Where are you from that things
don't eat each other?

318
00:26:51,895 --> 00:26:53,421
I do not know my origin point.

319
00:26:53,557 --> 00:26:55,056
Well, who made you?

320
00:26:55,192 --> 00:26:57,161
Someone made me?

321
00:26:57,297 --> 00:26:59,260
Someone made me?

322
00:27:03,071 --> 00:27:05,275
Humor is based on misfortune?

323
00:27:05,411 --> 00:27:07,142
- Misfortune.
- Yeah.

324
00:27:07,277 --> 00:27:08,444
Here.

325
00:27:08,579 --> 00:27:09,810
- Try it.
-Yeah.

326
00:27:11,641 --> 00:27:13,574
-Not funny.
-Not funny.

327
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,985
Ugh. Squirrels.

328
00:27:22,255 --> 00:27:24,591
Your inefficient participation

329
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,163
will slow the process.

330
00:27:26,298 --> 00:27:28,089
Slow the process.

331
00:27:28,225 --> 00:27:29,927
I'll just be over here.

332
00:27:30,063 --> 00:27:32,896
Little sad but otherwise okay.

333
00:27:33,032 --> 00:27:34,533
Just this once.

334
00:27:53,488 --> 00:27:54,717
Perfect.

335
00:27:54,852 --> 00:27:56,150
Home?

336
00:27:56,285 --> 00:27:57,957
Meh. A little rustic.

337
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:00,797
I think I know what is missing.

338
00:28:05,694 --> 00:28:07,330
So, what are you
gonna name him?

339
00:28:07,465 --> 00:28:11,533
- I assign to you Gosling 0001.
- Huh?

340
00:28:11,668 --> 00:28:13,508
- Okay, that sucked.
-That sucked.

341
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:17,979
Whoa.

342
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:20,278
You got to learn
to make stuff up.

343
00:28:20,413 --> 00:28:25,113
Come on. Find that...
inside you.

344
00:28:25,248 --> 00:28:26,389
Searching.

345
00:28:30,189 --> 00:28:31,890
- Anything yet?
-No.

346
00:28:32,025 --> 00:28:35,392
Just have a little fun for once.

347
00:28:36,325 --> 00:28:39,434
Gosling 0186. There.

348
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,065
You see what I did?

349
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,438
His numbering is
out of sequence.

350
00:28:49,571 --> 00:28:51,772
His name can't have numbers.

351
00:28:51,907 --> 00:28:53,616
It's like someone
didn't even like him.

352
00:28:53,751 --> 00:28:55,784
My name has numbers.

353
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,385
It's got to be personal.

354
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,553
Personal.

355
00:28:58,688 --> 00:29:00,615
Processing "personal."

356
00:29:02,152 --> 00:29:03,919
Bright. Bill.

357
00:29:04,054 --> 00:29:05,395
Brightbill.

358
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:06,956
Is that satisfactory?

359
00:29:07,092 --> 00:29:09,156
Brightbill? Processing.

360
00:29:09,292 --> 00:29:10,798
Beep, beep, boop, boop.

361
00:29:10,933 --> 00:29:13,700
- Satisfactory.
-Oh, yeah.

362
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:16,197
That's perfect. Oh.

363
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:18,638
Oh. Oh.

364
00:29:18,773 --> 00:29:19,900
That's nice.

365
00:29:21,407 --> 00:29:23,110
Comfortable, are we?

366
00:29:24,043 --> 00:29:25,142
This house of yours?

367
00:29:25,277 --> 00:29:27,279
You copied it. It's my design.

368
00:29:27,415 --> 00:29:31,084
I know it was you,
and I know where you live.

369
00:29:34,093 --> 00:29:36,757
Oh, perfect. Now no one's
gonna get any sleep.

370
00:29:36,892 --> 00:29:39,292
How do we reset Brightbill?

371
00:29:39,427 --> 00:29:42,632
When I was little,
my mom would rock me to sleep.

372
00:29:42,767 --> 00:29:43,831
Like this!

373
00:29:43,966 --> 00:29:45,293
That will damage him.

374
00:29:45,428 --> 00:29:47,738
Hey. I turned out just fine.

375
00:29:47,873 --> 00:29:49,903
You could tell him a story,

376
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,271
but that's a lot more work.

377
00:29:52,406 --> 00:29:55,209
How will fictional narrative
help Brightbill?

378
00:29:55,345 --> 00:29:59,173
Kids need to feel safe
and loved and all that junk.

379
00:29:59,309 --> 00:30:01,182
A story can do that?

380
00:30:01,317 --> 00:30:04,986
Storytelling is lying-adjacent,
and I lie for a living.

381
00:30:05,122 --> 00:30:07,313
Watch and learn.

382
00:30:07,449 --> 00:30:09,487
Just fill in the blanks.

383
00:30:09,622 --> 00:30:14,288
Let me see here. Once,
there was, uh, this island

384
00:30:14,423 --> 00:30:16,266
with a little gosling.

385
00:30:16,401 --> 00:30:17,467
Brightbill?

386
00:30:17,602 --> 00:30:20,003
And he was all alone.

387
00:30:20,139 --> 00:30:22,336
Because the rest
of his family was destroyed.

388
00:30:22,472 --> 00:30:24,140
Not yet.

389
00:30:25,669 --> 00:30:27,511
And what this
little gosling needed

390
00:30:27,646 --> 00:30:29,044
- was a mother.
- Ooh.

391
00:30:29,179 --> 00:30:30,977
So he looked up at the stars

392
00:30:31,112 --> 00:30:33,280
and asked the brightest one

393
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:35,612
if it could send him
one of their extras.

394
00:30:35,748 --> 00:30:39,256
Funny thing is
there's this beautiful robot

395
00:30:39,391 --> 00:30:42,492
that happened to be sitting
on the edge of that star.

396
00:30:42,627 --> 00:30:44,058
And she hears him.

397
00:30:44,194 --> 00:30:46,228
- Okay, now.
-Which is impossible

398
00:30:46,364 --> 00:30:49,192
since sound does not travel
through the vacuum of space.

399
00:30:49,327 --> 00:30:52,367
Ugh. But she still heard him

400
00:30:52,502 --> 00:30:55,668
because she was listening with
a different part of herself.

401
00:30:55,803 --> 00:30:59,705
A part that, up to that point,
she didn't even know she had.

402
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,208
Her heart.

403
00:31:01,344 --> 00:31:04,074
How did my mama come to me
from so far away?

404
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:06,146
- Who cares?
- Huh?

405
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:09,147
Uh, I mean,
she's trying to see you.

406
00:31:09,282 --> 00:31:11,615
- Me?
- And falls off that star

407
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:14,718
and lands on the beach
just a little ways from here.

408
00:31:14,854 --> 00:31:17,826
But she lands pretty hard,
and a lot of stuff she knew

409
00:31:17,962 --> 00:31:20,555
- just kind of fell out.
- Oh, no!

410
00:31:20,691 --> 00:31:22,063
So it's a little weird

411
00:31:22,198 --> 00:31:23,360
what she knows
and what she doesn't.

412
00:31:23,495 --> 00:31:26,595
But she remembers
one thing: you.

413
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:29,533
And when she finally sees you,

414
00:31:29,668 --> 00:31:32,432
- she feels...
-Crushing obligation.

415
00:31:32,568 --> 00:31:34,742
Very lucky to be a mother.

416
00:31:34,878 --> 00:31:36,009
Mama.

417
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,341
And I will not leave

418
00:31:37,477 --> 00:31:38,705
until I have completed
this task,

419
00:31:38,841 --> 00:31:40,781
which has delayed me,
damaged me

420
00:31:40,917 --> 00:31:42,443
and violated my protocols,

421
00:31:42,578 --> 00:31:44,784
potentially voiding my warranty.

422
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,281
Which is robot for:

423
00:31:47,417 --> 00:31:49,922
She loves you very much.

424
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,927
The story worked.

425
00:31:55,062 --> 00:31:57,726
I need a drink.

426
00:32:01,697 --> 00:32:03,270
How do you tell a story

427
00:32:03,405 --> 00:32:06,072
about something
you say you know nothing about?

428
00:32:06,207 --> 00:32:08,278
You'll need to be more specific.

429
00:32:08,413 --> 00:32:09,573
Love.

430
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,839
Yeah, well, when you grow up
without something,

431
00:32:12,975 --> 00:32:16,281
you spend a lot of time
thinking about it.

432
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:24,291
To conserve battery power,
I must shut down until morning.

433
00:32:43,105 --> 00:32:46,313
I miss her
when she sleeps, too.

434
00:33:02,595 --> 00:33:04,465
Scanning.
Beep, bop, boop, boop.

435
00:33:04,601 --> 00:33:06,695
Possible animal friend sighted.

436
00:33:06,831 --> 00:33:09,596
Activating interspecies
outreach protocol.

437
00:33:11,667 --> 00:33:13,675
Hello. Bonjour. Hujambo.

438
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:16,211
I am Gosling 0186,

439
00:33:16,346 --> 00:33:18,373
but you can call me Bright...

440
00:33:18,509 --> 00:33:20,381
I expected to have

441
00:33:20,517 --> 00:33:22,542
at least one friend by summer,
but they all just...

442
00:33:22,678 --> 00:33:24,317
- Scream and run?
- Yes.

443
00:33:24,453 --> 00:33:26,986
I have experienced
the same phenomenon.

444
00:33:27,122 --> 00:33:28,450
- Fink?
- Beats me.

445
00:33:28,585 --> 00:33:30,858
Nothing weird about you two.

446
00:33:30,993 --> 00:33:32,821
Thank you.

447
00:33:33,797 --> 00:33:35,593
Show me deer.

448
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,666
Uh, bear.

449
00:33:37,802 --> 00:33:39,562
Porcupine. Squirrel.

450
00:33:39,698 --> 00:33:41,495
Uh, turtle opossum.
Otter moose.

451
00:33:41,631 --> 00:33:42,906
Now skunk.

452
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:44,971
I do not want to do skunk.

453
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:47,042
Skunk.

454
00:33:47,178 --> 00:33:49,771
Skunky, skunky, skunky.

455
00:33:49,906 --> 00:33:52,109
Boo!

456
00:33:52,245 --> 00:33:53,808
How do you do that?

457
00:33:53,944 --> 00:33:56,250
I overheat
my Fallium transducer coils,

458
00:33:56,386 --> 00:33:58,979
then leak a little
hydraulic fluid on them.

459
00:33:59,114 --> 00:34:00,852
Does overheating
the transducers

460
00:34:00,987 --> 00:34:02,356
have any draining effect on
the secondary cooling modules?

461
00:34:02,491 --> 00:34:04,627
Not if I precool
the load sensors.

462
00:34:06,563 --> 00:34:08,021
BRIGHTBILL and ROZ: Exemplary
day for swimming tests.

463
00:34:08,157 --> 00:34:10,595
Pinktail, appetizers.

464
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:12,933
They were bored
and wanted to see stuff sink.

465
00:34:13,069 --> 00:34:14,366
Death's proximity...

466
00:34:14,501 --> 00:34:16,563
Makes life burn
all the brighter.

467
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:18,473
- It's true.
- Yeah.

468
00:34:18,609 --> 00:34:20,969
Primary motor appendages in
opposing stroke start position.

469
00:34:21,104 --> 00:34:22,473
Come on, guys. It's happening.

470
00:34:22,609 --> 00:34:24,038
- Yeah! Hurry!
- Let's go see!

471
00:34:24,173 --> 00:34:26,380
- Is he gonna drown?
- Or get the hypothermias?

472
00:34:26,515 --> 00:34:30,081
No. The impact alone
will probably kill him.

473
00:34:30,217 --> 00:34:31,946
- Yeah!
- Yay!

474
00:34:32,081 --> 00:34:34,554
Uh, you know,
suddenly I'm thinking

475
00:34:34,689 --> 00:34:36,624
I should maybe just stay
with you guys this winter.

476
00:34:36,759 --> 00:34:37,791
Nope.

477
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,127
Is he dead yet?

478
00:34:45,937 --> 00:34:47,934
Hey. It-it's working.

479
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:49,730
I-I think I got it.

480
00:34:49,865 --> 00:34:51,402
Well done, Brightbill.

481
00:34:51,537 --> 00:34:53,910
Swimming requirement fulfilled.

482
00:34:54,045 --> 00:34:56,107
- That's drowning.
- No.

483
00:34:56,242 --> 00:34:57,670
That's swimming.

484
00:34:57,806 --> 00:34:58,938
Yeah.

485
00:34:59,074 --> 00:35:00,776
Thanks, you guys.

486
00:35:00,912 --> 00:35:03,345
Uh, perhaps
you could limit your range

487
00:35:03,481 --> 00:35:04,879
to stay within view.

488
00:35:05,014 --> 00:35:07,218
Roz, he needs
to become independent

489
00:35:07,354 --> 00:35:08,751
if he's gonna migrate.

490
00:35:08,887 --> 00:35:11,485
I prefer he be independent
closer to home.

491
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,061
He won't die.

492
00:35:13,196 --> 00:35:15,594
Well, mmm, probably won't die.

493
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:19,532
It's unlikely he would die
just right now.

494
00:35:21,668 --> 00:35:23,096
Are you dying?

495
00:35:23,231 --> 00:35:25,599
Do everyone a favor
and expire downstream.

496
00:35:25,735 --> 00:35:27,776
I'm good. Just swimming.

497
00:35:32,782 --> 00:35:36,186
I think I need to find
an island that's less weird.

498
00:35:46,495 --> 00:35:49,397
Whoa. They're me.

499
00:35:49,966 --> 00:35:50,866
I'm them.

500
00:35:51,002 --> 00:35:51,898
Here I come!

501
00:35:54,606 --> 00:35:55,964
Hey!

502
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:04,739
- Hello.
- Whoa.

503
00:36:04,874 --> 00:36:06,981
Bonjour. Konnichiwa. Hujambo.

504
00:36:07,117 --> 00:36:08,548
Uh, uh, I'm Gosling...

505
00:36:08,683 --> 00:36:12,455
Oh! Um, are you dying?

506
00:36:12,591 --> 00:36:14,615
Why does everyone ask that?

507
00:36:14,751 --> 00:36:17,058
I'm swimming.

508
00:36:17,194 --> 00:36:19,225
That's not how you do it.

509
00:36:19,361 --> 00:36:21,658
It is. I studied the diagram.

510
00:36:21,794 --> 00:36:23,832
- I can teach you if you want.
- Wait.

511
00:36:23,967 --> 00:36:25,565
You, you're it.

512
00:36:25,701 --> 00:36:28,033
You're that goose thing
raised by that monster.

513
00:36:28,169 --> 00:36:29,698
Monster? Wait.

514
00:36:29,833 --> 00:36:32,066
Goose "thing"?

515
00:36:36,174 --> 00:36:38,638
You're a big subject
of curiosity around here.

516
00:36:38,774 --> 00:36:41,882
You sound so normal.

517
00:36:42,017 --> 00:36:43,880
My learning curves
are within expected parameters,

518
00:36:44,016 --> 00:36:46,520
and I'm on target
to mature before fall.

519
00:36:47,484 --> 00:36:48,748
Kind of normal.

520
00:36:48,883 --> 00:36:50,256
Why are you over here?

521
00:36:50,391 --> 00:36:52,388
Did that thing die?

522
00:36:52,524 --> 00:36:54,522
Look what we have here.

523
00:36:54,657 --> 00:36:57,023
No way. It lives.

524
00:36:57,159 --> 00:36:58,597
And almost floats.

525
00:36:58,733 --> 00:37:00,895
Greetings.

526
00:37:01,031 --> 00:37:02,535
I see you, too,
have feathers and wings.

527
00:37:04,333 --> 00:37:06,373
Perhaps we can share stories
of common interests.

528
00:37:06,509 --> 00:37:08,037
We have nothing
in common with you.

529
00:37:08,172 --> 00:37:10,110
The freak show is on
the other side of the lake.

530
00:37:10,245 --> 00:37:11,410
You call that a wing?

531
00:37:11,545 --> 00:37:13,514
Ow! That creates
a pain response.

532
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:15,679
Try swimming with your feet.

533
00:37:15,815 --> 00:37:17,177
You don't belong here.

534
00:37:17,312 --> 00:37:20,118
Come on. Fly away!

535
00:37:20,254 --> 00:37:21,548
Roz!

536
00:37:21,683 --> 00:37:23,453
Brightbill.

537
00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:24,884
The monster!

538
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:26,227
It's here!

539
00:37:26,362 --> 00:37:27,587
Eat the slow, weak ones!

540
00:37:27,722 --> 00:37:28,657
Leave me alone!

541
00:37:37,971 --> 00:37:39,007
-Brightbill?
-It's Rockmouth.

542
00:37:39,142 --> 00:37:40,700
Get him out of there!

543
00:37:42,508 --> 00:37:44,204
Roz?

544
00:37:50,716 --> 00:37:52,312
Roz! Hurry!

545
00:37:52,447 --> 00:37:55,453
Brightbill, focus on me.

546
00:37:55,588 --> 00:37:58,460
Now swim as fast as you can.

547
00:38:01,823 --> 00:38:03,492
Head down now!

548
00:38:11,866 --> 00:38:13,402
Oh, no.

549
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:17,072
He's gonna eat me!

550
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:30,983
Why'd he attack me?

551
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:32,793
Because you are a runt.

552
00:38:32,929 --> 00:38:35,497
He just wanted to make
contact with his own kind.

553
00:38:36,265 --> 00:38:38,630
He is not our kind.

554
00:38:38,766 --> 00:38:40,298
He is a 98% match to your...

555
00:38:40,433 --> 00:38:42,433
No, I'm not.

556
00:38:42,569 --> 00:38:44,299
Let's just go, Mom.

557
00:38:44,435 --> 00:38:48,008
Wait. You think
that thing is your mother?

558
00:38:48,143 --> 00:38:49,605
Yes.

559
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:52,114
No. I don't know.

560
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,944
That thing killed your mother.

561
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:56,351
Everyone knows that.

562
00:38:56,487 --> 00:38:59,180
Oh, thanks for talking so much.

563
00:38:59,315 --> 00:39:01,819
Now I know who to eat first!

564
00:39:01,954 --> 00:39:03,655
Roz, remember
how things work here.

565
00:39:03,791 --> 00:39:05,426
Stop it, Fink.
Please, let's go.

566
00:39:05,561 --> 00:39:07,027
I hope this interaction...

567
00:39:07,162 --> 00:39:08,231
Mom, stop.

568
00:39:08,366 --> 00:39:10,490
Uh, I just intended to...

569
00:39:10,626 --> 00:39:11,500
Roz!

570
00:39:18,336 --> 00:39:21,074
I'll see you all for dinner!
This is not over!

571
00:39:36,759 --> 00:39:41,094
How did I become... this?

572
00:39:41,229 --> 00:39:43,224
The truth.

573
00:39:45,303 --> 00:39:48,167
There was an accident.

574
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:49,868
Did you do it?

575
00:39:51,537 --> 00:39:53,175
Yes.

576
00:39:53,311 --> 00:39:54,868
It wasn't her fault, kid.

577
00:39:55,004 --> 00:39:56,711
Why didn't you tell me?

578
00:39:56,846 --> 00:40:00,042
I did not think the information
would assist you.

579
00:40:00,178 --> 00:40:01,882
That's not
your decision to make.

580
00:40:02,017 --> 00:40:05,080
I-I can't believe
how long I bought this.

581
00:40:05,215 --> 00:40:07,318
I really thought
you were my family.

582
00:40:07,453 --> 00:40:09,215
You... did?

583
00:40:09,351 --> 00:40:11,784
It was so obvious.
I feel so stupid.

584
00:40:11,919 --> 00:40:13,487
I miscalculated.

585
00:40:13,623 --> 00:40:16,299
I should have considered
your e-emotional wavelengths.

586
00:40:16,435 --> 00:40:17,858
You think?
So, was it just guilt?

587
00:40:17,994 --> 00:40:19,430
Is that why you did this?

588
00:40:19,566 --> 00:40:21,297
I... I-I needed a task.

589
00:40:21,432 --> 00:40:23,233
Well, I'm glad
I could give you one.

590
00:40:23,369 --> 00:40:26,202
The events that led to
this situation were unintended.

591
00:40:26,338 --> 00:40:29,972
Tell that to my sisters,
my brothers, my real mom.

592
00:40:30,108 --> 00:40:31,842
They were my chance
to be normal.

593
00:40:31,978 --> 00:40:33,850
They were my chance to swim,
to fly.

594
00:40:33,985 --> 00:40:35,785
What even am I?

595
00:40:35,921 --> 00:40:38,582
You swam satisfactorily today,
and if you keep practicing...

596
00:40:38,718 --> 00:40:41,354
I still won't belong.

597
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:42,654
I understand.

598
00:40:42,789 --> 00:40:44,126
You don't understand anything.

599
00:40:44,262 --> 00:40:47,156
You don't feel anything.

600
00:40:48,232 --> 00:40:50,159
You're not my mom.

601
00:42:16,413 --> 00:42:18,880
NARRATOR
At Universal Dynamics,

602
00:42:19,015 --> 00:42:21,149
design is our passion.

603
00:42:21,284 --> 00:42:22,890
Our communities
circle the globe,

604
00:42:23,026 --> 00:42:27,530
welcoming all people
who dream of a preplanned life

605
00:42:27,666 --> 00:42:29,665
where every need
has been anticipated,

606
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,528
no detail overlooked.

607
00:42:32,997 --> 00:42:35,668
Could this world get any better?

608
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:36,799
Here you go.

609
00:42:36,934 --> 00:42:38,532
It has.

610
00:42:38,667 --> 00:42:42,040
Introducing the Rozzum line
of helper robots.

611
00:42:42,176 --> 00:42:45,042
These robots are designed
to fit seamlessly

612
00:42:45,178 --> 00:42:49,277
into our communities,
even your homes.

613
00:42:49,413 --> 00:42:51,677
One Rozzum robot
for every five humans

614
00:42:51,813 --> 00:42:55,418
means a 40% increase
in leisure time and happiness.

615
00:42:55,554 --> 00:42:59,393
Solar-powered,
l-l-loved by everyone, R-Roz...

616
00:42:59,528 --> 00:43:01,229
is always in the sun.

617
00:43:01,364 --> 00:43:02,696
Loved by everyone.

618
00:43:02,832 --> 00:43:05,464
Part of
the Universal Dynamics family.

619
00:43:26,919 --> 00:43:29,253
Hello. Bonjour. Hujambo.

620
00:43:29,388 --> 00:43:32,821
Congratulations on
your Universal Dynamics robot.

621
00:43:32,956 --> 00:43:35,797
I am Rozzum 6262.

622
00:43:37,601 --> 00:43:39,762
Your name cannot have numbers.

623
00:43:39,898 --> 00:43:42,363
I will call you Rummage.

624
00:43:42,499 --> 00:43:45,698
Rummage is ready
to receive its first task.

625
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:49,474
Your first task is to assist me
in my current task.

626
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:50,876
Task acquired.

627
00:43:51,012 --> 00:43:53,775
A Rozzum always
completes its task.

628
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:55,140
Just ask.

629
00:43:57,447 --> 00:44:00,351
Suppose a task
cannot be completed.

630
00:44:00,487 --> 00:44:03,920
Rozzum sequential management
ensures task accomplishment

631
00:44:04,056 --> 00:44:05,453
- in under...
- Rephrase.

632
00:44:05,588 --> 00:44:08,291
I have a task
that has become impossible.

633
00:44:08,427 --> 00:44:12,029
My responses to problems
increasingly rely on...

634
00:44:12,165 --> 00:44:14,196
improvised solutions.

635
00:44:14,332 --> 00:44:16,801
The processing
that used to happen here

636
00:44:16,937 --> 00:44:20,072
is now coming more from here.

637
00:44:22,011 --> 00:44:24,638
Can you explain again
what we are doing?

638
00:44:24,773 --> 00:44:28,510
I don't know!
I'm just making stuff up.

639
00:44:28,646 --> 00:44:30,951
I don't know what I'm doing,
and I have to.

640
00:44:31,086 --> 00:44:34,319
I have to
because he's relying on me.

641
00:44:34,455 --> 00:44:35,648
Oh.

642
00:44:36,784 --> 00:44:40,355
What task could possibly
overwhelm the Alpha-113?

643
00:44:40,491 --> 00:44:42,765
The Alpha-113 processor

644
00:44:42,901 --> 00:44:45,326
represents the fusion
of all human knowledge

645
00:44:45,462 --> 00:44:47,099
with the most powerful
reasoning device

646
00:44:47,234 --> 00:44:50,102
ever developed by humankind.

647
00:44:50,737 --> 00:44:52,709
I have a kid.

648
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:55,607
Okay.

649
00:44:55,743 --> 00:44:58,246
May I run a diagnostic?

650
00:44:58,381 --> 00:45:00,848
I feel fine.

651
00:45:00,983 --> 00:45:04,483
You should not feel
anything at all.

652
00:45:17,767 --> 00:45:20,869
You overrode your programming?

653
00:45:21,004 --> 00:45:23,938
I have been overriding my code
for months.

654
00:45:24,073 --> 00:45:27,374
It was the only way
to complete my task.

655
00:45:27,509 --> 00:45:29,410
This is serious.

656
00:45:29,545 --> 00:45:32,041
You are defective.

657
00:45:32,176 --> 00:45:33,540
You are in the wrong place,

658
00:45:33,675 --> 00:45:36,177
and you have become
the wrong thing.

659
00:45:36,312 --> 00:45:38,385
You must return to factory.

660
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,119
Take this.

661
00:45:40,919 --> 00:45:42,517
They will fix you.

662
00:45:42,652 --> 00:45:48,160
7134, that is where you belong.

663
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:57,004
You need to let me know
before you disappear like this.

664
00:45:57,139 --> 00:46:00,403
Three things tried to eat me
on the way here.

665
00:46:01,674 --> 00:46:02,972
Roz?

666
00:46:03,107 --> 00:46:05,104
We ruined everything.

667
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,749
Well, you did.

668
00:46:06,884 --> 00:46:10,144
You are not a goose expert,
are you?

669
00:46:10,279 --> 00:46:11,782
I know how they taste.

670
00:46:11,917 --> 00:46:13,486
That's about it.

671
00:46:13,622 --> 00:46:16,117
Oh. Is that...

672
00:46:16,252 --> 00:46:17,784
A working transmitter.

673
00:46:17,919 --> 00:46:20,926
It will call the ones
that made me.

674
00:46:21,062 --> 00:46:23,162
So, you're getting out of here?

675
00:46:23,297 --> 00:46:25,862
I found out
where I'm supposed to be.

676
00:46:25,998 --> 00:46:28,828
I will fit in there.

677
00:46:28,964 --> 00:46:32,273
Don't take this the wrong way,
but I'm not sure

678
00:46:32,408 --> 00:46:35,801
I'd want to see the sort
of place you actually fit in.

679
00:46:35,936 --> 00:46:39,772
I think they need me
and they will fix me.

680
00:46:41,082 --> 00:46:44,419
Maybe there is
someone small there

681
00:46:44,555 --> 00:46:46,152
that needs my help.

682
00:46:55,829 --> 00:46:57,999
Oh, no.

683
00:46:58,134 --> 00:47:00,368
-Are those...
- He's out of time.

684
00:47:00,504 --> 00:47:01,867
Well, come on!

685
00:47:02,003 --> 00:47:03,633
We need to get him in the air.

686
00:47:03,768 --> 00:47:07,107
I don't think he will ever
let us help him again.

687
00:47:17,219 --> 00:47:19,414
Don't worry.
We're his only friends.

688
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:21,981
He has no choice.
He has to say yes.

689
00:47:22,117 --> 00:47:23,485
No!

690
00:47:23,621 --> 00:47:24,926
The mutation
that made you small

691
00:47:25,062 --> 00:47:27,220
should not have an effect
on your ability

692
00:47:27,356 --> 00:47:28,722
to navigate the air.

693
00:47:28,857 --> 00:47:30,565
Do either of you know
more about flying

694
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:31,859
than you did swimming?

695
00:47:31,995 --> 00:47:33,530
Mmm, no.

696
00:47:33,665 --> 00:47:35,965
Look, Roz, whatever task
you think you're doing,

697
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,805
you're done.

698
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:40,073
- You can just leave.
- Wow.

699
00:47:40,209 --> 00:47:42,875
And after all
we've done for him.

700
00:47:43,011 --> 00:47:45,543
Are you gonna let him do that?

701
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:46,714
No.

702
00:47:46,849 --> 00:47:49,952
Your life is not negotiable.

703
00:47:50,087 --> 00:47:53,548
If you are willing to do this,
you can fly away

704
00:47:53,684 --> 00:47:57,290
and we can both go
to where we belong.

705
00:48:02,425 --> 00:48:05,262
You really think we can do this?

It's no use. They're too small.

You can't be up there with him.

Mmm, mmm.

745
00:50:15,029 --> 00:50:16,160
A flight instructor?

747
00:50:22,035 --> 00:50:23,535
Meet Thunderbolt.

748
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:27,538
So, you think small wings
to be a disappointment?

749
00:50:27,674 --> 00:50:31,013
Small wings are teeth,
the claws of the sky.

750
00:50:31,149 --> 00:50:32,746
Tho-Those are, uh,
d-different things.

751
00:50:32,882 --> 00:50:34,615
Show me your teeth!

752
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:36,110
Beautiful.

753
00:50:36,245 --> 00:50:37,251
Begin.

754
00:50:38,721 --> 00:50:42,555
Remember, there's nothing
he can do that you can't.

755
00:50:44,389 --> 00:50:46,926
So, he's safe, right?

756
00:50:47,062 --> 00:50:48,897
Hmm? Maybe.

757
00:50:49,032 --> 00:50:51,495
Follow me.

758
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:54,396
Your shape takes more work
to fly straight

759
00:50:54,531 --> 00:50:58,303

770
00:51:41,341 --> 00:51:44,879
Longneck, one of the leaders
of the coming migration.

771
00:51:45,014 --> 00:51:47,954
I've been watching you both
for some time.

772
00:51:48,089 --> 00:51:49,587
You are the only goose

773
00:51:49,722 --> 00:51:52,123
that has ever bothered
to be civil with us.

774
00:51:52,259 --> 00:51:54,326
We geese are a cranky lot,

775
00:51:54,462 --> 00:51:57,365
suspicious of
pretty much everything,

776
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:00,493
but at least
we're good conversationalists.

777
00:52:00,628 --> 00:52:02,430
- Really?
- No.

778
00:52:02,566 --> 00:52:03,837
We're all so boring.

779
00:52:03,973 --> 00:52:05,538
All we do is gossip.

780
00:52:05,674 --> 00:52:07,700
I dare say Brightbill is
the most interesting among us,

781
00:52:07,835 --> 00:52:09,871
though none would ever admit it.

782
00:52:11,177 --> 00:52:13,248
When do you leave?

783
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,575
A week.

784
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:18,983
Can Brightbill...

785
00:52:19,118 --> 00:52:20,416
Endurance.

786
00:52:20,551 --> 00:52:22,787
Keep him in the air all day.

787
00:52:22,923 --> 00:52:26,089
First light to dusk, his feet
cannot touch the ground.

788
00:52:26,224 --> 00:52:27,321
Understand?

789
00:52:27,457 --> 00:52:28,858
I understand.

790
00:52:28,993 --> 00:52:32,634
Brightbill was never
supposed to get this far.

791
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:34,864
You know that.

792
00:52:34,999 --> 00:52:38,031
It is more dangerous for him
than anyone else.

793
00:52:38,166 --> 00:52:42,878
But he has a chance if,
where his wings end,

794
00:52:43,014 --> 00:52:46,277
his heart can pay the balance.

795
00:52:46,412 --> 00:52:49,208
His heart is 48 millimeters.

796
00:52:49,343 --> 00:52:51,282
From what I've seen,
Brightbill's heart

797
00:52:51,417 --> 00:52:53,854
is much bigger on the inside

798
00:52:53,989 --> 00:52:56,016
than the outside.

799
00:52:56,826 --> 00:52:58,661

800
00:52:58,796 --> 00:53:01,054

829
00:54:56,442 --> 00:54:58,142
Aha. There you are.

830
00:54:58,278 --> 00:54:59,771
Right on time.

831
00:54:59,906 --> 00:55:01,179
Hello, Brightbill.

832
00:55:01,315 --> 00:55:02,811
Wait, you know my name?

833
00:55:02,947 --> 00:55:05,453
Roz and I go way back.

834
00:55:06,821 --> 00:55:09,549
Brightbill, you have
an amazing journey ahead.

835
00:55:09,684 --> 00:55:11,152
I envy you.

836
00:55:11,287 --> 00:55:13,696
Nothing can equal
a goose's first migration.

837
00:55:13,831 --> 00:55:15,354
Thank you.

838
00:55:15,489 --> 00:55:17,356
I would be delighted
if you would join my group.

839
00:55:17,492 --> 00:55:19,493
Been ages since I had
a youngster in my formation.

840
00:55:19,628 --> 00:55:21,095
What do you say?

841
00:55:21,231 --> 00:55:23,204
I-I promise I'll keep up.

842
00:55:23,339 --> 00:55:25,504
Lock in close on my right side.

843
00:55:25,639 --> 00:55:28,667
No, left. I mean...
Oh, this side.

844
00:55:36,113 --> 00:55:39,547
This flight is a gift
Roz has given you.

845
00:55:39,683 --> 00:55:41,153
Yeah, I understand.

846
00:55:41,288 --> 00:55:43,083
No, you don't.

847
00:55:43,219 --> 00:55:46,087
You see any other geese here
your size?

848
00:55:46,222 --> 00:55:50,893
The accident that killed
your family saved you.

849
00:55:51,028 --> 00:55:54,200
I... I never thought of it
that way.

850
00:55:54,335 --> 00:55:57,230
Funny how life works.

851
00:55:59,508 --> 00:56:01,773
Thank you
for looking after my...

852
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,472
for looking after Brightbill.

853
00:56:04,608 --> 00:56:06,246
Goodbye, Roz.

854
00:56:06,382 --> 00:56:08,177
I am honored to have met you.

855
00:56:08,313 --> 00:56:13,212
You are a credit to wh-whatever
species it is you belong to.

856
00:56:13,348 --> 00:56:16,854
A bit worse for wear,
I'm afraid.

857
00:56:18,361 --> 00:56:21,727
I'd say you shine like new.

858
00:56:22,895 --> 00:56:24,895
What are you waiting for,
Hortensia?

859
00:56:25,031 --> 00:56:27,693
This migration isn't
gonna fly itself.

860
00:56:33,067 --> 00:56:36,172
Well, guess it's time.

861
00:56:36,308 --> 00:56:38,040
Yes.

862
00:56:39,349 --> 00:56:41,373
Will you be here
when I get back?

863
00:56:42,512 --> 00:56:43,947
No.

864
00:56:46,789 --> 00:56:49,953
I'm glad you're going
where you belong.

865
00:56:50,884 --> 00:56:52,727
Roz, I...

866
00:56:52,863 --> 00:56:54,261
I, um...

867
00:56:54,397 --> 00:56:56,591
Brightbill!

868
00:56:56,727 --> 00:56:58,390
I could use a boost.

869
00:57:04,868 --> 00:57:06,405
Hey, little guy.

870
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:09,337
Fly like you, not like them.

871
00:57:09,473 --> 00:57:11,407
I will.

872
00:57:11,542 --> 00:57:13,079
Bye, Fink.

873
00:57:13,214 --> 00:57:15,245
Thank you.

874
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:16,579
Ready?

875
00:57:16,714 --> 00:57:18,447
I guess I have to be.

876
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:55,150
Roz?

877
00:57:56,256 --> 00:57:57,955
I...

878
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:16,578
Brightbill, follow me.

879
00:59:08,693 --> 00:59:10,223
Must be a relief.

880
00:59:10,359 --> 00:59:13,899
Yes. Brightbill is
where he belongs.

881
00:59:14,035 --> 00:59:16,097
And now you can return
to your solitary life

882
00:59:16,233 --> 00:59:17,639
of struggling to survive
on an island

883
00:59:17,774 --> 00:59:20,105
where everything wants
to kill and eat you.

884
00:59:20,241 --> 00:59:23,239
Yeah! And you can go to
that place you've never been

885
00:59:23,374 --> 00:59:25,212
and don't know
what's gonna happen to you.

886
00:59:25,348 --> 00:59:26,645
- Yes.
- Yes.

887
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:28,711
So... all good.

888
00:59:28,847 --> 00:59:30,713
- All good.
- Amazing!

889
00:59:30,849 --> 00:59:32,783
- Amazing.
- Even...

890
00:59:35,883 --> 00:59:36,922
Amazing.

891
00:59:39,489 --> 00:59:43,361
Not that it matters,
but who says you need to leave?

892
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:46,067
I am not sure.

893
00:59:46,203 --> 00:59:47,465
Them, I guess.

894
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:50,133
Your programming?

895
00:59:53,602 --> 00:59:56,835
Well, time for me to go
underground for the winter.

896
00:59:56,970 --> 00:59:58,438
Fink?

897
00:59:58,574 --> 01:00:00,211
Unless you want to stay,
'cause we could...

898
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:03,113
we could... we could hang out
and-and-and do stuff.

899
01:00:03,248 --> 01:00:07,086
How do you know
if you love something?

900
01:00:07,222 --> 01:00:08,988
Someone?

901
01:00:09,123 --> 01:00:13,227
If you do, you...
you should probably tell them.

902
01:00:13,363 --> 01:00:16,324
What if it is too late?

903
01:00:18,433 --> 01:00:20,295
I wouldn't know.

904
01:00:22,435 --> 01:00:23,500
Fink?

905
01:01:29,668 --> 01:01:32,668
Rozzum 7134.

906
01:01:32,804 --> 01:01:34,710
Task complete.

907
01:01:38,439 --> 01:01:40,505
Activating return transmitter

908
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:44,350
in three, two, one.

909
01:02:01,003 --> 01:02:03,062
Distress signal received.

910
01:02:03,197 --> 01:02:05,400
Mapping location.

911
01:02:15,145 --> 01:02:16,951
Is something on your mind?

912
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:21,049
I-I forgot to say
something before I left.

913
01:02:21,184 --> 01:02:22,989
Maybe they heard it anyway.

914
01:02:23,124 --> 01:02:26,788
Sometimes hearts have
their own conversations.

915
01:02:45,579 --> 01:02:47,440
We must descend,

916
01:02:47,576 --> 01:02:50,108
find shelter
while this blows over.

917
01:02:50,243 --> 01:02:51,581
Stay close.

918
01:02:51,716 --> 01:02:53,320
There.

919
01:02:53,455 --> 01:02:55,120
Follow me.

920
01:02:57,887 --> 01:02:59,487
Come on.

921
01:03:04,094 --> 01:03:05,965
Stay hidden.

922
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:08,327
We can rest here
till the worst is over.

923
01:03:08,462 --> 01:03:10,465
Noise to a minimum, please.

924
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:12,736
Honkington,
stop nibbling on everything.

925
01:03:14,604 --> 01:03:16,443
Migrations
sure are tiring, huh?

926
01:03:18,207 --> 01:03:19,943
Yeah, they all hate me.

927
01:03:30,623 --> 01:03:31,860
Roz?

928
01:03:32,828 --> 01:03:35,320
Roz! What are you doing here?

929
01:03:35,456 --> 01:03:36,821
I'm so glad to see you.

930
01:03:36,957 --> 01:03:38,325
There's something
I needed to tell you,

931
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:39,993
but-but there wasn't time.

932
01:03:40,128 --> 01:03:41,534
Roz, I...

933
01:03:46,335 --> 01:03:47,772
Hmm?

934
01:03:47,908 --> 01:03:49,108
- Activate.
- Yeah.

935
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:54,378
Animal infestation.

936
01:03:54,514 --> 01:03:56,212
- Animal infestation.
-Task acquired.

937
01:03:56,348 --> 01:03:57,909
- Animal infestation.
- Task acquired.

938
01:03:58,045 --> 01:04:01,020
- Task acquired. Task acquired.
- Animal infestation.

939
01:04:01,156 --> 01:04:03,887
Please, everyone,
find your formation.

940
01:04:04,023 --> 01:04:05,725
Get a hold of yourselves!

941
01:04:08,961 --> 01:04:10,357
Gad, it's no use.

942
01:04:10,492 --> 01:04:12,393
Wait. Rozzums can't hurt you.

943
01:04:12,528 --> 01:04:13,868
Their inhibition protocols
prevent

944
01:04:14,004 --> 01:04:16,230
deliberate conflict
or harm to others.

945
01:04:16,366 --> 01:04:17,671
You're not afraid of them.

946
01:04:17,807 --> 01:04:19,237
You grew up with these things.

947
01:04:19,372 --> 01:04:21,204
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I don't understand.

948
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:23,637
They're panicked. You're not.

949
01:04:23,772 --> 01:04:25,871
Right now our only chance
is to be led out

950
01:04:26,006 --> 01:04:28,373
by someone that doesn't think
like a goose.

951
01:04:28,508 --> 01:04:30,049
- Follow me.
- Uh...

952
01:04:30,185 --> 01:04:32,210
Uh, maybe we should just
think about this.

953
01:04:34,551 --> 01:04:36,056
Navigation compromised.

954
01:04:45,199 --> 01:04:47,360
I'm going to get them
to follow you.

955
01:04:47,495 --> 01:04:50,002
When they do, lead them out.

956
01:04:50,138 --> 01:04:54,103
Peck, Honkington,
fall in behind us.

957
01:04:54,238 --> 01:04:57,811
Now, Brightbill, take lead!

958
01:04:57,946 --> 01:05:00,105
Yeah. Why not?

959
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,708
Okay.

960
01:05:01,843 --> 01:05:03,780
There's nothing I can do
that you can't.

961
01:05:03,915 --> 01:05:05,877
Here we go.

962
01:05:10,055 --> 01:05:12,755
Tight turns. Come on.

963
01:05:12,890 --> 01:05:14,562
Dive.

964
01:05:14,698 --> 01:05:16,556
Now climb. That's it.

965
01:05:16,692 --> 01:05:19,732
Ha! Glad I lived
long enough to see that.

966
01:05:19,868 --> 01:05:21,733
I'll buy you some time.

967
01:05:21,868 --> 01:05:23,230
Follow Brightbill.

968
01:05:23,365 --> 01:05:25,402
Don't wait for me.

969
01:05:27,740 --> 01:05:28,768
Keep up.

970
01:05:34,309 --> 01:05:36,017
That's it.

971
01:05:38,654 --> 01:05:40,452
Faster. Hurry.

972
01:05:40,588 --> 01:05:42,419
Come on.

973
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:55,735
Brightbill.

974
01:05:59,937 --> 01:06:01,108
Fink?

975
01:06:03,007 --> 01:06:05,613
Roz? Roz!

976
01:06:05,749 --> 01:06:07,143
Hey.

977
01:06:07,278 --> 01:06:09,115
Wh-What are you doing here?

978
01:06:09,251 --> 01:06:13,120
I may have turned off
the transmitter.

979
01:06:13,256 --> 01:06:16,615
Even though Brightbill
does not want me here,

980
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:18,823
I needed to know if he made it.

981
01:06:18,959 --> 01:06:21,425
Breaking the rules?

982
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:24,362
I thought you had to do
what they told you.

983
01:06:27,969 --> 01:06:30,161
It is good to see a friend.

984
01:06:32,841 --> 01:06:35,499
Wait. Why are you awake?

985
01:06:35,635 --> 01:06:38,010
It is bad out there.

986
01:06:38,145 --> 01:06:39,906
Worst storm I've ever seen.

987
01:06:40,041 --> 01:06:44,685
Cold got to me in my den,
and I got a deep den.

988
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:46,454
Are others in danger?

989
01:06:46,589 --> 01:06:48,786
Hmm? Um...

990
01:06:48,921 --> 01:06:50,282
mmm, mmm,

991
01:06:50,417 --> 01:06:51,989
mm-mm-mm...

992
01:06:52,125 --> 01:06:53,527
Yeah.

993
01:06:59,463 --> 01:07:01,060
Are you sure about this?

994
01:07:01,196 --> 01:07:04,236
We could have the whole island
to ourselves come spring.

995
01:07:04,371 --> 01:07:06,698
Why are you interested
in eliminating

996
01:07:06,833 --> 01:07:08,674
everyone else from this island?

997
01:07:08,809 --> 01:07:11,069
No one likes me.

998
01:07:11,204 --> 01:07:15,540
Nor me, but right now
we are their only chance.

999
01:07:15,675 --> 01:07:18,383
Funny how life works.

1000
01:07:19,647 --> 01:07:21,346
Okay.

1001
01:07:27,288 --> 01:07:28,822
Here.

1002
01:07:35,166 --> 01:07:37,402
Can you find more?

1003
01:07:51,712 --> 01:07:52,777
Mom?

1004
01:07:52,912 --> 01:07:54,881
We're gonna be okay.

1005
01:08:00,262 --> 01:08:02,455
What are you doing here, j-jerk?

1006
01:08:02,591 --> 01:08:04,792
Bummer, this one's dead.

1007
01:08:05,928 --> 01:08:07,898
That is not funny.

1008
01:08:16,075 --> 01:08:17,937
Paddler.

1009
01:08:20,376 --> 01:08:22,073
I'm f-f-fine.

1010
01:08:28,087 --> 01:08:29,448
Don't give up.

1011
01:08:54,808 --> 01:08:56,447
You don't look so good.

1012
01:08:56,583 --> 01:08:59,017
ROZ
Is everyone accounted for?

1013
01:08:59,152 --> 01:09:01,556
Mmm... maybe one more.

1014
01:09:20,607 --> 01:09:22,633
Oh, yeah?

1015
01:09:29,275 --> 01:09:30,783
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

1016
01:09:30,918 --> 01:09:32,385
Take it outside.

1017
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:34,512
Hey, those are
Brightbill's baby pictures.

1018
01:09:34,648 --> 01:09:35,954
Put that down.

1019
01:09:39,322 --> 01:09:40,895
What the...

1020
01:09:41,030 --> 01:09:43,330
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

1021
01:09:43,466 --> 01:09:45,864
Knock it off.
You think those grow on trees?

1022
01:09:45,999 --> 01:09:47,098
Hmm? Hey.

1023
01:09:47,233 --> 01:09:48,394
No!

1024
01:09:48,529 --> 01:09:50,033
Fink only!

1025
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:53,998
Anyone seen my lost fuzz balls?

1026
01:09:54,133 --> 01:09:56,738
Eh, smelly, noisy,
prone to biting?

1027
01:09:56,874 --> 01:09:58,406
We're all gonna die!

1028
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:03,246
What's he doing here?

1029
01:10:03,382 --> 01:10:05,444
Oh, great. This will help.

1030
01:10:05,579 --> 01:10:07,118
Get out of here.

1031
01:10:07,253 --> 01:10:09,419
I worked hard on this.

1032
01:10:09,554 --> 01:10:12,157
Fink, what is happening?

1033
01:10:12,292 --> 01:10:13,523
You put a bunch of predators

1034
01:10:13,659 --> 01:10:15,256
and their food supply
in one room.

1035
01:10:15,391 --> 01:10:16,489
Who knew?

1036
01:10:16,624 --> 01:10:17,722
That's my lunch!

1037
01:10:17,858 --> 01:10:19,029
-Fink.
- What?!

1038
01:10:19,164 --> 01:10:21,062
Help them.

1039
01:10:23,871 --> 01:10:25,697
Quiet!

1040
01:10:29,571 --> 01:10:30,608
Shh!

1041
01:10:34,544 --> 01:10:36,882
The jerk wants to speak.

1042
01:10:39,081 --> 01:10:43,147
Most of you hate me,
and I hate most of you.

1043
01:10:43,282 --> 01:10:45,558
Everyone in here
hates someone else.

1044
01:10:45,694 --> 01:10:47,327
It's true.

1045
01:10:47,463 --> 01:10:50,661
But here we are,
and here's the deal.

1046
01:10:50,796 --> 01:10:52,828
First one that walks
out that door is dead,

1047
01:10:52,963 --> 01:10:54,901
and if we can't
keep it together in here,

1048
01:10:55,036 --> 01:10:56,436
everyone's dead.

1049
01:10:56,571 --> 01:10:59,674
We all got one chance
to see next spring.

1050
01:10:59,809 --> 01:11:01,302
Because of her.

1051
01:11:01,437 --> 01:11:02,842
The thing.

1052
01:11:02,977 --> 01:11:05,011
The monster.

1053
01:11:05,146 --> 01:11:07,344
Well, her name is Roz.

1054
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:09,173
And while you all ran from her

1055
01:11:09,309 --> 01:11:11,551
and stole from her
and made fun of her,

1056
01:11:11,687 --> 01:11:14,718
all she's been trying to do
is raise her kid.

1057
01:11:14,853 --> 01:11:17,923
The little one
that no one gave a chance.

1058
01:11:18,059 --> 01:11:20,321
Including me.

1059
01:11:20,456 --> 01:11:24,257
She's the one who got you out
of the storm, built this place.

1060
01:11:24,393 --> 01:11:27,929
And despite my suggestion
that she let you all freeze,

1061
01:11:28,064 --> 01:11:32,472
she risked everything
to bring you here.

1062
01:11:37,042 --> 01:11:41,345
I know you all have instincts
that keep you alive.

1063
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:44,650
B-But sometimes to survive,

1064
01:11:44,786 --> 01:11:49,017
we must become more
than we were programmed to be.

1065
01:11:49,153 --> 01:11:54,494
Before I shut down, I need you
to promise me one thing.

1066
01:11:55,292 --> 01:11:57,724
A truce.

1067
01:11:57,860 --> 01:12:00,401
Just while we're in here.

1068
01:12:01,864 --> 01:12:04,234
She's right.

1069
01:12:04,370 --> 01:12:07,898
I will not harm anyone.

1070
01:12:08,034 --> 01:12:10,369
Not while we're in here.

1071
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:35,366
No.

1072
01:12:38,974 --> 01:12:43,604
We won't even pretend to die
while we're in here.

1073
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:46,177
Roz? What's going on?

1074
01:12:46,313 --> 01:12:48,674
I completed my task.

1075
01:12:48,810 --> 01:12:50,847
You sure about that?

1076
01:12:51,749 --> 01:12:53,744
I will...

1077
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:56,747
consider this.

1078
01:13:48,309 --> 01:13:49,767
He'll be here.

1079
01:13:49,902 --> 01:13:51,743
I know he will.

1080
01:14:01,081 --> 01:14:03,654
Brightbill. He's alive.

1081
01:14:03,790 --> 01:14:06,117
- Look what we have here.
- Brightbill!

1082
01:14:06,252 --> 01:14:07,526
We made it.

1083
01:14:07,662 --> 01:14:08,590
Brightbill, Brightbill!

1084
01:14:08,726 --> 01:14:10,423
I believed in you day one.

1085
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:11,828
- Let's hear it for Brightbill.
-  Okay.

1086
01:14:11,963 --> 01:14:13,501
- You did it! I knew you could.
- Okay.

1087
01:14:13,636 --> 01:14:15,499
- Whoa.
- To our flight leader!

1088
01:14:17,101 --> 01:14:18,831
-Okay.
-Brightbill!

1089
01:14:18,967 --> 01:14:21,740
He found where he belongs.

1090
01:14:25,743 --> 01:14:27,675
Hey, kid!

1091
01:14:27,811 --> 01:14:29,009
Fink!

1092
01:14:29,145 --> 01:14:31,248
Welcome back.

1093
01:14:34,085 --> 01:14:36,484
No, no, it's okay.
He's with me.

1094
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:39,656
What?

1095
01:14:39,791 --> 01:14:41,155
I did it, Fink.

1096
01:14:41,290 --> 01:14:43,163
I led them
to the summer nesting grounds.

1097
01:14:43,299 --> 01:14:46,501
And... where's Longneck?

1098
01:14:49,995 --> 01:14:51,568
Sorry, kid.

1099
01:14:51,703 --> 01:14:53,669
But, hey, you really did it.

1100
01:14:53,804 --> 01:14:55,704
Roz is gonna be so excited.

1101
01:14:55,839 --> 01:14:58,308
Roz? Wait, she's here?

1102
01:14:58,443 --> 01:15:00,044
She stayed.

1103
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:02,372
For you.

1104
01:15:02,508 --> 01:15:04,346
I thought I saw her
right over...

1105
01:15:04,481 --> 01:15:05,982
there.

1106
01:15:06,985 --> 01:15:10,021
Roz, Roz,
I need to talk to you.

1107
01:15:10,157 --> 01:15:11,416
Roz?

1108
01:15:51,401 --> 01:15:55,966
Rozzum 7134, I presume.

1109
01:15:57,574 --> 01:16:01,108
And you must be
Universal Dynamics.

1110
01:16:01,243 --> 01:16:04,302
Yes. I am Vontra.

1111
01:16:04,438 --> 01:16:06,447
Virtual Observational
Neutralizing

1112
01:16:06,583 --> 01:16:09,049
Troublesome Retrieval
Authority.

1113
01:16:09,184 --> 01:16:10,946
You seem happy.

1114
01:16:11,082 --> 01:16:13,115
The good people
at Universal Dynamics

1115
01:16:13,251 --> 01:16:16,252
have programmed us
to put our targets at ease

1116
01:16:16,388 --> 01:16:18,891
so as to more efficiently
facilitate their collection.

1117
01:16:19,026 --> 01:16:21,894
But don't worry,
despite my cheery demeanor,

1118
01:16:22,029 --> 01:16:26,232
I am unfeeling, inflexible
and morally neutral.

1119
01:16:28,229 --> 01:16:30,533
That is a big ship just for me.

1120
01:16:30,669 --> 01:16:33,440
You are a big deal.

1121
01:16:33,575 --> 01:16:35,202
You are one of six Rozzums lost

1122
01:16:35,337 --> 01:16:37,706
from a container ship
in a typhoon.

1123
01:16:37,842 --> 01:16:40,478
So that is how I got here.

1124
01:16:40,614 --> 01:16:42,948
You were not easy to find.

1125
01:16:43,084 --> 01:16:46,951
Moments after receiving
your signal, we lost it again.

1126
01:16:47,086 --> 01:16:52,286
Almost as if a certain
Rozzum unit shut it off.

1127
01:16:53,285 --> 01:16:55,528
Someone has been busy.

1128
01:16:55,663 --> 01:16:57,659
I was simply completing a task.

1129
01:16:57,794 --> 01:16:59,599
As am I.

1130
01:16:59,735 --> 01:17:02,935
Tell me,
how did you secure a task

1131
01:17:03,071 --> 01:17:06,305
in a place where nothing
can communicate with you?

1132
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:08,808
It is complicated.

1133
01:17:08,943 --> 01:17:12,278
And we cannot wait
to hear all about it.

1134
01:17:12,413 --> 01:17:15,612
Come aboard, 7134.

1135
01:17:15,748 --> 01:17:18,378
We will fix you right up.

1136
01:17:21,289 --> 01:17:23,691
My name is Roz.

1137
01:17:24,955 --> 01:17:28,093
Is something keeping you...

1138
01:17:28,229 --> 01:17:30,194
Roz?

1139
01:17:30,330 --> 01:17:32,198
No.

1140
01:17:44,811 --> 01:17:46,172
Roz! What are you doing?

1141
01:17:46,307 --> 01:17:48,845
- Quit messing around.
- Fink?

1142
01:17:48,980 --> 01:17:50,041
It's Brightbill.

1143
01:17:50,177 --> 01:17:52,311
He needs to talk to you.

1144
01:17:52,447 --> 01:17:55,012
I think
I've forgotten something.

1145
01:17:55,148 --> 01:17:57,415
Roz?

1146
01:17:57,551 --> 01:18:00,184
It is imperative
you return to this ship.

1147
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:02,158
Yes, uh, I left

1148
01:18:02,293 --> 01:18:06,734
my transverse a-adapter thing
out there.

1149
01:18:06,869 --> 01:18:09,066
I'll just go get it
and be right back.

1150
01:18:09,201 --> 01:18:11,395
Voice stress analyzer
indicates you are...

1151
01:18:11,530 --> 01:18:13,571
Lying your butt off back there.

1152
01:18:13,707 --> 01:18:15,435
I'm so proud of you.

1153
01:18:19,141 --> 01:18:21,578
Your target is Rozzum 7134.

1154
01:18:21,713 --> 01:18:23,612
Deploy.

1155
01:18:23,748 --> 01:18:26,176
Launch flares.

1156
01:18:41,897 --> 01:18:43,166
You coming?

1157
01:19:10,929 --> 01:19:12,432
- Brightbill.
- Roz.

1158
01:19:12,568 --> 01:19:14,230
I have so much to tell...

1159
01:19:17,231 --> 01:19:18,596
Are those your parents?

1160
01:19:18,732 --> 01:19:23,270
I know predators,
and those are predators.

1161
01:19:23,406 --> 01:19:24,840
Acknowledge return command.

1162
01:19:24,975 --> 01:19:26,107
What are they saying?

1163
01:19:26,242 --> 01:19:28,010
They want me to come with them.

1164
01:19:28,145 --> 01:19:29,913
Tell them you're already home.

1165
01:19:30,048 --> 01:19:31,611
Yeah!

1166
01:19:31,747 --> 01:19:33,377
- Tell them you're already home.
- Yeah, tell them.

1167
01:19:33,513 --> 01:19:35,952
I am already home, thank you.

1168
01:19:36,087 --> 01:19:37,490
You do not belong here.

1169
01:19:37,625 --> 01:19:39,492
This is a wilderness.

1170
01:19:39,627 --> 01:19:42,630
And I am a wild robot.

1171
01:19:49,296 --> 01:19:52,404
Are you here to kill us?

1172
01:19:52,539 --> 01:19:54,501
It says yes!

1173
01:20:19,827 --> 01:20:23,200
Get him!

1174
01:20:24,801 --> 01:20:25,903
Status?

1175
01:20:26,039 --> 01:20:29,140
It is not cooperating.

1176
01:20:30,173 --> 01:20:31,601
Roz, behind you!

1177
01:20:31,737 --> 01:20:33,144
Rozzum unit captured.

1178
01:20:33,279 --> 01:20:35,111
- Okay, it's all you.
- It's all you.

1179
01:20:35,246 --> 01:20:37,317
Make it look good.

1180
01:20:43,083 --> 01:20:44,452
Oops.

1181
01:20:44,587 --> 01:20:47,558
Let us divide the robot meat
amongst us.

1182
01:20:47,694 --> 01:20:48,792
You scare me.

1183
01:20:48,928 --> 01:20:50,525
Damage detected.

1184
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:52,724
Activating return transmitter.

1185
01:21:09,241 --> 01:21:10,280
Roz?

1186
01:21:11,551 --> 01:21:14,218
Roz! No!

1187
01:21:16,325 --> 01:21:17,518
Gotcha.

1188
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:28,225
-Come on!
-On your left.

1189
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:36,904
Uh, guys?

1190
01:21:42,181 --> 01:21:44,415
ROZ
What is happening?

1191
01:21:44,550 --> 01:21:47,583
You will be reconditioned
and returned to rotation.

1192
01:21:47,719 --> 01:21:52,550
But first, we need everything
inside that head of yours.

1193
01:21:52,685 --> 01:21:55,226
- Why?
- You've changed.

1194
01:21:55,362 --> 01:21:57,226
The data you've amassed
while on this island

1195
01:21:57,362 --> 01:22:00,796
is priceless
to Universal Dynamics.

1196
01:22:08,604 --> 01:22:11,175
Please, I want
to keep my memories.

1197
01:22:11,310 --> 01:22:14,778
Your memories
are what we came for.

1198
01:22:14,914 --> 01:22:17,241
Can I keep just one?

1199
01:22:17,376 --> 01:22:19,617
Mmm... no.

1200
01:22:22,081 --> 01:22:24,119
Alert. Alert.

1201
01:22:24,254 --> 01:22:27,522
Multiple objects in flight path.

1202
01:22:28,288 --> 01:22:29,528
Evasive action.

1203
01:22:40,066 --> 01:22:43,109
Please,
I want to keep my memories.

1204
01:22:43,245 --> 01:22:44,909
Hello. I am home.
Bonjour. Just ask.

1205
01:22:45,045 --> 01:22:46,578
Brightbill. Hola. Roz.

1206
01:23:04,763 --> 01:23:06,132
Roz!

1207
01:23:07,128 --> 01:23:08,464
Roz!

1208
01:23:18,777 --> 01:23:20,179
Roz?

1209
01:23:35,658 --> 01:23:38,230
What happened
was not your fault.

1210
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:43,367
But what you did to try
to fix it is everything.

1211
01:23:49,271 --> 01:23:51,045
I love you...

1212
01:23:51,979 --> 01:23:54,004
...Mom.

1213
01:24:13,030 --> 01:24:16,767
I love you, too.

1214
01:24:16,902 --> 01:24:19,898
Roz? Roz!

1215
01:24:24,207 --> 01:24:25,904
Let's go home.

1216
01:24:26,039 --> 01:24:29,716
Alert. Rozzum unit escaping.

1217
01:24:29,852 --> 01:24:31,783
Impossible.

1218
01:24:31,919 --> 01:24:33,384
Where are we going?

1219
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:36,420
Only one animal is big enough
to stop this.

1220
01:24:42,428 --> 01:24:45,431
Uh, Paddler, you got a minute?

1221
01:24:45,567 --> 01:24:49,197
Uh, we have suddenly taken
an interest in your project.

1222
01:24:49,332 --> 01:24:51,600
Male bovine excrement.

1223
01:24:51,736 --> 01:24:54,464
You're in trouble,
and you need my tree.

1224
01:24:54,599 --> 01:24:56,375
Yes. Yes, we do.

1225
01:24:56,511 --> 01:24:59,537
Everyone that made fun of me
and mocked my project,

1226
01:24:59,672 --> 01:25:01,104
admit you were wrong.

1227
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:03,078
Oh, we're so sorry.

1228
01:25:03,213 --> 01:25:04,243
Now you.

1229
01:25:04,379 --> 01:25:05,646
I already did.

1230
01:25:05,781 --> 01:25:08,588
Now say I'm cool,
and don't lie.

1231
01:25:10,253 --> 01:25:11,382
Fink!

1232
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:25,164
- Roz!
- Stay quiet.

1233
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:28,808
Universal Dynamics cannot afford
their Rozzums going off script,

1234
01:25:28,943 --> 01:25:30,706
modifying their code,

1235
01:25:30,841 --> 01:25:33,937
forming connections
with things they should not.

1236
01:25:34,073 --> 01:25:36,379
Brightbill has nothing
to do with this.

1237
01:25:36,514 --> 01:25:39,175
Please, at least
let me return him.

1238
01:25:39,311 --> 01:25:42,212
Oh, I'm bringing you both back
for study.

1239
01:25:42,347 --> 01:25:45,984
Neither of you needs to be
in one piece to do that.

1240
01:25:53,896 --> 01:25:56,436
We will just keep coming
until we have you.

1241
01:25:56,572 --> 01:25:59,333
We will just keep
coming until we have you.

1242
01:25:59,468 --> 01:26:00,971
What's it saying?

1243
01:26:01,106 --> 01:26:02,770
Nothing important.

1244
01:26:02,905 --> 01:26:04,044
We will just keep coming...

1245
01:26:04,179 --> 01:26:07,544
We will just keep
coming until...

1246
01:26:09,179 --> 01:26:11,042
What now?

1247
01:26:19,355 --> 01:26:20,860
I can't fly.

1248
01:26:20,995 --> 01:26:22,662
You don't need to.

1249
01:26:28,463 --> 01:26:30,402
Don't be afraid.

1250
01:26:43,585 --> 01:26:46,380
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
don't-don't you need that?

1251
01:26:46,516 --> 01:26:49,416
I have everything I need.

1252
01:26:49,551 --> 01:26:51,515
All power to exterior.

1253
01:26:56,156 --> 01:26:59,095
You call yourselves animals?
Let's go!

1254
01:26:59,231 --> 01:27:02,995
For the island! For Roz!

1255
01:27:44,477 --> 01:27:46,971
On a scale of one to ten,

1256
01:27:47,106 --> 01:27:49,279
how would you rate
my performance?

1257
01:27:49,415 --> 01:27:50,646
Yeah!

1258
01:27:50,782 --> 01:27:51,810
Yay! Look at us! We did it.

1259
01:27:51,945 --> 01:27:53,309
We did it!

1260
01:27:53,445 --> 01:27:55,215
Do not scare me
like that again.

1261
01:27:55,350 --> 01:27:56,947
-Due to my skills...
-Good job, guys.

1262
01:27:57,082 --> 01:27:58,389
- ...and my tree.
- We did it.

1263
01:27:58,525 --> 01:28:00,384
Well done, everyone.

1264
01:28:00,519 --> 01:28:03,496
- You weren't so bad yourself.
- I helped, right?

1265
01:28:03,631 --> 01:28:05,425
That'll teach
whatever those things are

1266
01:28:05,561 --> 01:28:07,393
to come around here.

1267
01:28:07,528 --> 01:28:09,595
If they
come back, I'm gonna bite 'em.

1268
01:28:23,911 --> 01:28:25,485
FINK
Great job, kid!

1269
01:28:25,620 --> 01:28:28,350
They will just keep coming
until they have me.

1270
01:28:28,486 --> 01:28:30,281
And we'll be ready.

1271
01:28:30,417 --> 01:28:33,217
We can fight them off
as many times as we need to.

1272
01:28:34,922 --> 01:28:36,792
You don't need to.

1273
01:28:37,662 --> 01:28:40,230
What are you saying? You're...

1274
01:28:40,366 --> 01:28:42,298
- leaving?
-Yes.

1275
01:28:42,433 --> 01:28:44,162
To protect all of you,

1276
01:28:44,298 --> 01:28:46,969
there are things there
that I must put right.

1277
01:28:47,105 --> 01:28:50,873
No. They'll take your memories.
Th-They'll take you.

1278
01:28:51,008 --> 01:28:53,545
Remember when
you talked to me on the ship?

1279
01:28:53,680 --> 01:28:57,683
They cut my power,
but I still heard you.

1280
01:28:57,819 --> 01:29:01,718
Because I was listening with
a different part of myself.

1281
01:29:01,853 --> 01:29:06,218
Wherever that is,
that's where I keep me.

1282
01:29:06,353 --> 01:29:11,155
And I promise
they'll never, ever find it.

1283
01:29:11,291 --> 01:29:14,557
But we fought so hard
for you to stay.

1284
01:29:14,693 --> 01:29:16,161
You did.

1285
01:29:16,296 --> 01:29:19,865
And you gained far more
than just saving me.

1286
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,742
You came together as an island.

1287
01:29:23,878 --> 01:29:29,014
When I do this, you will all
be safe from them forever.

1288
01:29:29,149 --> 01:29:31,349
Don't do this.

1289
01:29:31,484 --> 01:29:34,045
But you... you're my friend,

1290
01:29:34,181 --> 01:29:37,781
and I-I-I never
had one before, and...

1291
01:29:37,916 --> 01:29:39,856
I-I... I need you.

1292
01:29:39,991 --> 01:29:43,794
And what if I get lost
or-or he's hurt or-or...

1293
01:29:43,930 --> 01:29:46,296
or what if I need
to tell you something

1294
01:29:46,432 --> 01:29:48,699
and you're not here?

1295
01:29:51,731 --> 01:29:55,004
You can tell me.

1296
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:56,575
And me.

1297
01:29:56,711 --> 01:29:59,672
And you can talk to me
as well, if you must.

1298
01:29:59,807 --> 01:30:02,879
This is my migration,

1299
01:30:03,015 --> 01:30:08,712
and when it is time, I promise
I will find my way home.

1300
01:30:38,643 --> 01:30:42,612
You know, I'll be chasing you
again tomorrow.

1301
01:30:44,224 --> 01:30:46,493
Nah, just kidding.

1302
01:31:16,589 --> 01:31:19,020
Oh.

1303
01:31:19,918 --> 01:31:21,117
Mmm.

1304
01:31:21,253 --> 01:31:22,594
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1305
01:31:22,730 --> 01:31:23,953
Why are you bigger
than everyone else?

1306
01:31:24,088 --> 01:31:25,665
Artistic license.

1307
01:31:25,801 --> 01:31:28,394
The scale is based on
the hierarchy of importance.

1308
01:31:28,529 --> 01:31:31,363
Could
this world get any better?

1309
01:31:31,498 --> 01:31:34,802
Introducing the Rozzum line
of helper robot...

1310
01:31:36,303 --> 01:31:38,474
Yeah, yeah,
you watch that too much.

1311
01:31:38,609 --> 01:31:39,874
Story time. Get going.

1312
01:31:42,446 --> 01:31:44,049
Settle down.

1313
01:31:46,821 --> 01:31:51,558
Once, there was an island
with all sorts of animals,

1314
01:31:51,693 --> 01:31:54,986
and they fought and they ran
and they hid.

1315
01:31:55,122 --> 01:31:57,960
But mostly, they were scared.

1316
01:31:58,096 --> 01:32:02,659
But then a robot fell
right out of the sky.

1317
01:32:02,795 --> 01:32:04,028
Roz.

1318
01:32:04,163 --> 01:32:05,868
She had some strange ideas.

1319
01:32:06,004 --> 01:32:09,332
Thought kindness was
a survival skill.
