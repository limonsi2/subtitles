00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:25,297
and compassion
leads to right action.

179
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:30,435
That is what
we're missing.

180
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:35,206
¶¶

181
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,474
I'm Daniel Hirsch.

182
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:38,510
I'm president of the Committee
to Bridge the Gap,

183
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:41,679
and I recently retired
as the director

184
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:45,216
of the Program on Environmental
and Nuclear Policy

185
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:47,385
at the University of California,
Santa Cruz.

186
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:50,222
¶¶

187
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,422
Duffield:
My name is Denise Duffield.

188
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:52,690
I'm the associate director

189
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:56,195
for Physicians for Social
Responsibility, Los Angeles.

190
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,298
In the mid to late 1940s,
the U.S. government

191
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:02,233
was trying to find a location
in Southern California

192
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:05,036
to do nuclear reactor
development testing,

193
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,272
and also rocket testing.

194
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,641
The field lab was originally
selected as a location

195
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,576
to be away
from populated areas,

196
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,978
because they knew they were
going to be doing research

197
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:16,014
that could be
potentially dangerous.

198
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,150
Hirsch: They did
a marvelous study

199
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:21,853
to determine what would be
the least dangerous place

200
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:23,788
to put a reactor
testing facility.

201
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:26,525
And the Santa Susanna facility
ranked very poorly.

202
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:28,761
They were concerned that
any radioactivity

203
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:32,597
that was released could readily
get to populated areas nearby.

204
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:35,500
They chose to site
in Santa Susanna anyway.

205
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:37,702
Duffield: Santa Susanna ranked
fifth or sixth

206
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:39,971
because of the
meteorological conditions.

207
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:40,940
But it was
selected anyway,

208
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:43,876
because of the driving time
to UCLA.

209
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:46,077
At the time that
the Santa Susanna facility

210
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,679
was established,
there was relatively low

211
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:50,581
population density
around it.

212
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,351
Man:
This is a quiet place.

213
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,421
The atom at work for peace
is quiet.

214
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,191
So, over the years,
they built 10 nuclear reactors

215
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:01,659
and plutonium fuel
fabrication facility,

216
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,828
which took plutonium --

217
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:04,029
the most dangerous material
on Earth --

218
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:06,497
and made nuclear fuel
out of it.

219
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,934
And a hot lab,
in which they shift in

220
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:13,237
irradiated nuclear fuel
to be cut apart.

221
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:14,739
None of those reactors,
by the way,

222
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:16,407
had a containment
structure.

223
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:19,577
Those domes that you associate
with the power plants,

224
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:21,446
they were just
regular rooms.

225
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,049
The most well-known of those
is a reactor

226
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:26,384
what's called
the "Sodium Reactor Experiment."

227
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:28,953
Man: SRE --
the Sodium Reactor Experiment --

228
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:31,989
was radically different
from other reactor concepts.

229
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,458
Man #2:
Sustained atomic fission

230
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,060
has been obtained
in this nuclear reactor,

231
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:38,396
created and built
for industrial applications,

232
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:41,400
medical research,
and scientific exploration.

233
00:11:41,468 --> 00:11:44,669
Man #3: On the first full power
run of the reactor steam plant,

234
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,871
all systems
operated smoothly,

235
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,140
and full power
was obtained with ease.

236
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,877
Man #4: For the first time
in the United States,

237
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:53,678
an entire community
was illuminated

238
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,948
by electricity generated
by an atomic reactor.

239
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:04,255
When we lived here
before we learned the news,

240
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:07,192
it was just utopia.

241
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:15,733
Kowalski :We had a rural
atmosphere close to the city.

242
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:19,504
We had children who loved
playing in the creeks.

243
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:24,443
And I thought we'd found
a dream place.

244
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:26,812
Tyler: You know, it was
the '50's and the '60's.

245
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,313
It was magical.

246
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:31,583
In those days,
we'd go out the door,

247
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:34,920
Mom would say, "Come back,"
you know, "before dinner."

248
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:36,754
And it was
totally safe.

249
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,422
Nobody locked
their doors.

250
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,993
We just played outdoors
all day, all the time.

251
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:46,364
Man:
This is how American families
are living in their new homes.

252
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,635
Tyler: The Valley was
the ideal place to go.

253
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:53,905
It was agricultural,
at that time.

254
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:55,707
It was rural.

255
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,943
And it would
have been, really,

256
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:02,480
the most idyllic place
to raise a child,

257
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:07,585
before the story
that's unfolding now.

258
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:12,190
Klea: I think I was 19 years old
when I came to California.

259
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:17,062
I started working at Atomics
International in Santa Susanna

260
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,030
in 1963.

261
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:22,767
I felt a sense of pride
to be there, and be involved.

262
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:25,770
And every worker
felt a sense of pride.

263
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,507
I didn't know anything
about what they were doing

264
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:32,143
where I worked,
except it was secret.

265
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,545
Blaze: The employees of
Santa Susanna Field Laboratory

266
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:41,186
and Canoga and DeSoto facility
changed the face of humanity.

267
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:43,321
My father was employed
by Rocketdyne

268
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:46,324
between 1962 and 1969.

269
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:48,494
He was the senior propulsion
test inspector

270
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:51,262
on the Saturn V
rocket engine program.

271
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:53,197
I was never concerned
about what my dad did

272
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,199
for a living
as a young child.

273
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:58,470
He didn't really elaborate
on what his job duties were

274
00:13:58,538 --> 00:13:59,604
at the worksite.

275
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:01,006
They were sworn
to secrecy.

276
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:05,076
We didn't know what we had
really been dealing with

277
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:07,345
all these years, what was really
going on up there.

278
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:11,416
And it just changed, because
then, we didn't know if we came,

279
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:12,951
and brought our children

280
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:15,820
to a place that could be
harmful to them,

281
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:17,355
because how would we know?

282
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,156
My girls loved
climbing in creeks,

283
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:22,026
and getting frogs.

284
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,161
And it was scary.
It was scary.

285
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,531
And so, as time went on,

286
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,766
it was even worse
than we could even imagine.

287
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:40,311
¶¶

288
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,915
Face: My name
is John Face.

289
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:46,317
I was there at the time of
the worst nuclear accident

290
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,120
in the history
of the United States.

291
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:54,892
I was 19 when I was hired there
in 1959.

292
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:56,427
I didn't even know
what a reactor was

293
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:58,062
when I first went
to work there.

294
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,663
Man: The fella who was
sitting at the controls

295
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,798
certainly looked
young to me.

296
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:02,934
Are these young men
in your organization?

297
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:06,471
Yes. All these operators
are fairly young fellows,

298
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:08,106
but all they need is
a high-school education

299
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:10,308
with some major
in science.

300
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:13,578
It was the Cold War time
at that time,

301
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,681
and they was trying
to help the United States

302
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:18,050
outdo the Russians.

303
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:20,584
Man: On the one side,
the forces of freedom,

304
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:23,254
on the other,
the forces of Communism.

305
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:27,392
It was an honor
to work there.

306
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,594
I was working with
the very best scientists

307
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:30,828
in the nuclear business.

308
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:35,567
In fact, the person that had
overseen the SRE reactor,

309
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:39,704
for Atomics International
was Dr. Marvin J. Fox.

310
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,840
He's the one that helped
invent the atomic bomb

311
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:47,244
that was dropped
on Hiroshima, there.

312
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,714
On July 13th...

313
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:57,788
...it was probably
about eleven o'clock

314
00:15:57,857 --> 00:16:02,693
was then I got there on
that particular graveyard shift.

315
00:16:02,763 --> 00:16:04,896
Went in the building.

316
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:07,499
I pulled up to
the control room.

317
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:11,202
Looking through the door,

318
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,105
and I seen my crew
was already there.

319
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:18,776
Then, I looked even closer,
and I seen Dr. Marvin J. Fox.

320
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:20,178
And he had two others
with him

321
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:23,247
that I wasn't sure
quite who they were.

322
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:25,083
And I said,
"Man, there's something

323
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:27,619
that's just not right."

324
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:30,855
So, I got brave,
and opened the door, real quiet.

325
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:34,825
And as I stood there,

326
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:38,363
I heard the words
coming out of Dr Fox's mouth.

327
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:45,703
I heard
my supervisor ask,

328
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:50,307
"Can we tell our families
what happened today?"

329
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:53,377
The three looked at each other
for a minute.

330
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:56,814
Dr. Fox,
he turned around real quick,

331
00:16:56,816 --> 00:16:59,985
staring me in the eyes,
almost nose to nose.

332
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:05,490
"Nobody will say a word."

333
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:13,664
From that point on, there was
a cover-up of what happened.

334
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,368
Man: It was the first step
in a nuclear nightmare,

335
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:18,569
when a government official
said that a breakdown

336
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:21,405
in an atomic power plant
in Pennsylvania today

337
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:25,609
is probably the worst nuclear
reactor accident to date.

338
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:28,879
Hirsch:
I was teaching at UCLA in 1979,
and there was an accident

339
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:31,950
at a nuclear power plant
in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania,

340
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:34,018
called "Three Mile Island."

341
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:35,920
And my students
wanted to research

342
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:37,421
whether there were
nuclear activities

343
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,689
in the Los Angeles area,

344
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:39,925
and whether they had
any problems.

345
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:41,292
And I said,
"Sure. Go ahead."

346
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:42,928
I didn't think
they'd find anything.

347
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,095
And within a period
of a few weeks,

348
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:46,697
they discovered
that there had been

349
00:17:46,767 --> 00:17:48,699
a partial meltdown
in the reactor,

350
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:49,700
at what we now call

351
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:51,569
"the Santa Susanna
Field Laboratory."

352
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,838
They obtained documents,
and photos,

353
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,708
and also film footage
of the incident.

354
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:59,577
Man: 13 of the 43 uranium
fuel elements

355
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,380
eventually became
overheated.

356
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:03,314
The fuel swelled in size,

357
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,517
and structural damage
was sustained.

358
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,319
Hirsch: The partial meltdown
occurred in a reactor

359
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:10,354
that had no
containment structure.

360
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:12,189
The radioactivity
was so high

361
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:15,394
that they had to open
this huge garage-type door

362
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:17,094
to try to vent
the radioactivity

363
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:18,663
out towards Simi Valley,

364
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:20,732
and for that matter,
the rest of L.A.

365
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,201
One scholar,
Dr. Andre Nakatani,

366
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:25,670
had estimated that
the radioactive iodine

367
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:28,140
released from meltdown
could have been

368
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:30,642
250 times greater
than the amount

369
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,577
released from the
Three Mile Island accident.

370
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:34,345
TMI was a much
larger reactor,

371
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:36,013
but it had
a containment structure.

372
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:37,482
This is
a smaller reactor,

373
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,484
but it had nothing to prevent
greater activity.

374
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:42,953
Face: The radiation was clear
off of scales.

375
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:45,923
Wherever the wind is blowing,
whichever direction,

376
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:49,426
that's where the radiation
travels, of course,

377
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:50,961
just like smoke
with a fire.

378
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:55,099
The man that was working there,
they were so disturbed about it,

379
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:58,135
because all that radiation
went over their own homes.

380
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:00,271
Five weeks after
the accident occurred,

381
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,739
they issued
a news release

382
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,475
embargoed for the Saturday
morning paper.

383
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:06,176
And the press release
didn't say

384
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:07,345
there had been
a partial meltdown,

385
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:08,913
didn't said there was
a serious accident,

386
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:10,314
didn't say there was
any radiation.

387
00:19:10,384 --> 00:19:11,749
They said
just the opposite.

388
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:14,185
At the very moment that they
issued that press release,

389
00:19:14,187 --> 00:19:17,588
they were venting radioactive
gases into the environment.

390
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,723
Reporter: Despite the
seriousness of the accident,

391
00:19:19,793 --> 00:19:21,326
the official news release
claimed there was

392
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:24,495
no indication
of unsafe reactor conditions.

393
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,131
They lied.

394
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:29,200
and I couldn't say
a word.

395
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:30,702
20 years
I was silenced.

396
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:46,217
¶¶

397
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:53,124
¶¶

398
00:19:53,126 --> 00:19:54,224
Man: Good evening,
everybody.

399
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:56,560
[Indistinct]
has been showing us films

400
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:57,761
of a nuclear mishap

401
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,097
that occurred near Los Angeles
20 years ago,

402
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,299
but which has not been revealed
to the public before.

403
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,635
Thank you, John.

404
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,972
The reactor was located 35 miles
from downtown Los Angeles.

405
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,107
It was called The "Sodium
Reactor Experiment," or SRE.

406
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:13,278
But in 1959, when it suffered
its fuel rod melting,

407
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:15,446
the general public
was not informed.

408
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,881
Local public safety officials
weren't told much, either.

409
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,717
Today is the first time
that I've heard

410
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,119
of the '59 incident, when you
mentioned it a while ago.

411
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:25,856
Industry experts tell us
that certain risks were taken.

412
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:28,994
Well, I was really
appalled at the --

413
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,595
sort of the cavalier attitude
that they demonstrated.

414
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:34,265
It was actually
very undramatic.

415
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:37,534
It did not appear to be a hazard
to the public

416
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:38,669
or to our employees.

417
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:41,071
O feel less concerned about it
than I would

418
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,341
the long-term effect
of the smog of Los Angeles.

419
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,946
The potential hazard
of a major release

420
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:50,081
into the environment
was just not there.

421
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:52,716
Man: And it's taken until
this week, 20 years later,

422
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:56,654
for the details
to be widely broadcast.

423
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:57,922
Olney:
We all have the idea,

424
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:01,426
all of us who were involved
in this project,

425
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:05,896
that it had been
a cover-up.

426
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:09,399
We know that we had to approach
this in a very,

427
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:13,104
very careful way,
because we knew that

428
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:15,973
we were looking at
a very powerful industry

429
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:18,642
that had not been challenged
in the way

430
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:21,713
that we were prepared
to challenge it ever before.

431
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,448
It was a scary
proposition,

432
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:25,183
to take on
the nuclear industry --

433
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:27,318
a very scary
proposition.

434
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,920
So, the accident at
Santa Susanna was serious,

435
00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:32,723
and yet, there's room for debate
on how well it was handled.

436
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:36,261
We knew we had something
that was really important,

437
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:39,596
particularly in the context
of what was going on

438
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:40,864
at Three Mile Island.

439
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:46,804
I think what it reveals is
that this great guarantee

440
00:21:46,873 --> 00:21:51,942
of the ultimate safety
of the industry was a phony.

441
00:21:51,944 --> 00:21:53,010
It was a fake.

442
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:53,944
It was wrong.

443
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:58,048
¶¶

444
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:01,987
¶¶

445
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:04,788
Hirsch: It was one of the worst
nuclear accidents in history,

446
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:06,090
to that point.

447
00:22:09,395 --> 00:22:13,698
No one knew until my students
uncovered the documents

448
00:22:13,766 --> 00:22:15,166
two decades later,

449
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:16,301
Man: The material
that we got

450
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:18,736
mostly came from an outfit
in in Westwood

451
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:20,705
called "Bridge the Gap,"
which is an anti-nuclear group.

452
00:22:20,774 --> 00:22:21,939
What happened
at Santa Susanna

453
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,408
would not happen
at a well-run facility.

454
00:22:24,477 --> 00:22:29,413
This was a case of tremendous
environmental negligence.

455
00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:33,585
They cut corners over
and over and over again.

456
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:35,920
The risks continued
for many decades.

457
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:38,890
Duffield: The nuclear work
was over four decades.

458
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:42,660
The other aerospace work
really didn't cease until 2006.

459
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:47,264
So, over the course of decades,
in the course of accidents,

460
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:50,201
spills, releases,
some intentional,

461
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:54,806
the soil, and the groundwater,
and surface water runoff

462
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,007
has become
very contaminated.

463
00:22:57,076 --> 00:22:59,743
Man: Produced by Rocketdyne,
a division of North American,

464
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:01,879
in the canyons
of Southern California,

465
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:03,682
the engine -- sometimes
called a "rocket,"

466
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:05,149
sometimes called
a "power plant,"

467
00:23:05,151 --> 00:23:07,751
sometimes "the booster" --
is on.

468
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:10,587
¶¶

469
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:16,360
Kowalski: We'd all lived knowing
that there were rocket tests.

470
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:18,695
We used to have
big booms.

471
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:23,367
And we would see, like, mushroom
clouds above the facility.

472
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:28,305
I would play outside with
my friends until it got dark.

473
00:23:28,374 --> 00:23:32,544
I'd be in the cul de sac,
and we'd all look up, and...

474
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:34,546
We could hear those roars.

475
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:37,214
Man: In California's
Santa Susanna Mountains,

476
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,017
Rocketdyne engineers
that created

477
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:42,252
America's largest
propulsion field laboratory.

478
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:44,789
The whole of the Valley
would shudder.

¶¶

481
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:58,202
Tens of thousands
of rocket tests.

482
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,471
And those would
produce huge plumes

483
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,574
of contamination
that would be spreading

484
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:04,007
at substantial distance.

485
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:05,743
Man:
On the ashes of campfires

486
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:07,979
built here
by [indistinct],

487
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:10,881
engines poured forth
their pillars of flame.

488
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,350
Over 30,000
rocket engine tests.

489
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:15,419
And a lot of
the chemical contamination

490
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:17,421
on the site
is a result of that.

491
00:24:17,423 --> 00:24:20,158
Hirsch: They ended up flushing
out rocket test engines

492
00:24:20,226 --> 00:24:23,760
with a very toxic solvent
called "TCE" --

493
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:25,729
hundreds of thousands
of gallons,

494
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:30,200
leaving half a million gallons
of TCE in the groundwater.

495
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:31,502
Duffield: There was
a hot lab there,

496
00:24:31,571 --> 00:24:33,904
there they would re-process
nuclear fuel

497
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:36,073
that was shipped in
from around the country.

498
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:37,408
That lab had fires.

499
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,710
Man: Gamma radiation is hard
to work with sometimes.

500
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:41,845
They also had
open burn pits.

501
00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:43,281
There, they would take,
each month,

502
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:47,484
100 or so 55-gallon drums
of toxic chemicals,

503
00:24:47,554 --> 00:24:50,455
and they would shoot at them
with rifles, to ignite them.

504
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:51,722
And they would
catch fire.

505
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:54,725
Huge plumes
of toxic smoke.

506
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:57,294
Workers were killed
because they were

507
00:24:57,363 --> 00:24:59,997
illegally disposing
of hazardous materials

508
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:01,666

And I think anyone

516

of anything like that,
they should be told,

00:25:36,302 --> 00:25:38,602
Dodge: The Santa Susanna
Field Lab hill

524
00:25:38,671 --> 00:25:41,406
is contaminated with
a veritable who's who

525
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:44,174
of toxic chemicals,
from heavy metals,

526
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:48,645
to dioxins, to percolate,
to volatile organic acids,

527
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:51,248
and multiple
radioactive neuclides,

528
00:25:51,317 --> 00:25:54,251
which come from
the nuclear partial meltdown,

529
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,720
and also numerous accidents
over the years

530
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:58,522
with the other reactors
on site.

531
00:25:58,524 --> 00:25:59,923
When it comes to
radioneuclides,

532
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:01,658
we actually describe
not the half life --

533
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:05,262
which is the time where, after
which it would be half as potent

534
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:07,198
as it was,
as it degrades.

535
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:09,700
We describe something called
its "hazardous life,"

536
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:12,537
which is actually equivalent
to 20 half-lives.

537
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:14,137
So, these are
the most dangerous,

538
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:16,940
which we have well studied,
and well --

539
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:19,676
a high awareness
of their health impacts

540
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:25,683
that go on for these hundreds,
if not half a million years.

541
00:26:25,685 --> 00:26:27,150
Duffield: Right now,
half a million people

542
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:29,621
live within 10 miles
of the site.

543
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,625
Hirsch: I'm asked over and over
again, "Where is it safe?

544
00:26:34,627 --> 00:26:35,760
Where would it
be dangerous?"

545
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:39,662
And after studying this
for almost 40 years,

546
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:41,598
I'm afraid
I can't answer that.

547
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,000
People need
to understand that

548
00:26:43,002 --> 00:26:44,301
the Santa Susanna
Field Laboratory

549
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,637
is on a mountain.

550
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:50,207
Gravity wants to carry
that contamination downhill.

551
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:56,647
There is not a glass wall
surrounding Santa Susanna

552
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:58,115
that prevents contaminants

553
00:26:58,183 --> 00:26:59,783
from being blown off-site
by the wind.

554
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:03,387
The wind will carry
the contaminants.

555
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:07,657
There is not some kind of a dam
built around this site,

556
00:27:07,727 --> 00:27:08,859
so that,
when it rains,

557
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:11,928
the rainfall won't carry
the contaminants.

558
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:13,897
So, when it rains,
the surface water

559
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:18,235
carries the radioactivity
down intermittent streams.

560
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:21,204
It's the headwaters
of the Los Angeles River.

561
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:23,073
So, in terms of
L.A. County,

562
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:25,075
you're contaminating
everything along the L.A. river

563
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:28,078
and the various streams
that lead to it.

564
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:29,880
There was
a children's camp

565
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:32,416
called the "Brandeis-Bardin
Institute,"

566
00:27:32,418 --> 00:27:35,485
a Jewish training institute
for young children

567
00:27:35,554 --> 00:27:36,920
and for college students.

568
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:40,090
It is right beneath the
Santa Susanna Field Laboratory.

569
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,092
There has been
some contamination found

570
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:44,596
on the Brandeis property,

571
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:48,165
and there is concern about
the health of the children

572
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,801
who have been
or are going to that facility.

573
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:54,504
Soil contamination goes down
through the Brandeis camp,

574
00:27:54,573 --> 00:27:57,574
and into the arroyo,
where that contaminated water

575
00:27:57,643 --> 00:28:00,144
then percolates
into the groundwater.

Bumstead:
My daughter's a fighter.

611
00:31:21,914 --> 00:31:24,114
She's incredibly strong.

612
00:31:24,116 --> 00:31:25,749
I could not be
more proud of her,

613
00:31:25,818 --> 00:31:28,118
and yet, part of me
still grieves

614
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:30,153
that she has to be
that way.

615
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,193
You know, I wish more than
anything she could have

616

just had
a normal childhood.

617
00:31:39,598 --> 00:31:41,664
You know, she was diagnosed
when she was 4.

618
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,901
That's almost before anyone
can have a memory.

619
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:48,238
She was immediately limited
from being around other kids

620
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,108
because of
the germ factor.

621
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:56,546
But also, my son
was so emotionally impacted.

622
00:31:56,548 --> 00:31:59,116
Both of my children lost
a big part of their childhood,

623

and that's not fair.

624

We can never

and put the fear of
[bleep] God into her.

641
00:33:14,093 --> 00:33:17,761
The site has three
responsible parties.

642
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,196
There's the Department
of Energy,

643
00:33:19,264 --> 00:33:22,366
which leased part of
its property from Boeing.

644
00:33:22,434 --> 00:33:23,700
There's Nassau,

645
00:33:23,702 --> 00:33:25,168
and then,
there is Boeing itself,

646
00:33:25,237 --> 00:33:27,804
which owns
most of the site.

647
00:33:27,873 --> 00:33:29,340
Hirsch: At some point,

to Rockwell International,

649
00:33:30,976 --> 00:33:33,543
And Rockwell International
eventually sold

650
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:36,246
its Rocketdyne division
to Boeing.

651
00:33:36,315 --> 00:33:39,282
And Boeing
assumed the liabilities

652
00:33:39,284 --> 00:33:41,051
of Rocketdyne
for the contamination

Reiser: The ultimate regulator
of the Santa Susanna field site

655
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:47,590
is California,

656
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:51,694
and specifically the Department
of Toxic Substances Control,

657
00:33:51,764 --> 00:33:55,331
which is a subdivision
of the California EPA.

658
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,601
California is the one
who gets to say,

659

"This is how much
gets cleaned up."

660
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:01,538
We have the authority
to shut down a business

00:34:01,607 --> 00:34:05,141
when we feel like the health
of the community is at risk,

662
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,210
and when we see
evidence of harm

663
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:08,278
to the environment,
or to human health.

664
00:34:13,183 --> 00:34:15,285
Grover: There were a lot
of people that had a stake

665
00:34:15,354 --> 00:34:18,889
in keeping this story
under wraps.

666
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:22,359
I had a number of insiders
at DTSC tell me,

667
00:34:22,428 --> 00:34:25,129
"The people that run
this agency have no interest

668

in telling the truth
about Santa Susanna."

669
00:34:28,033 --> 00:34:32,235
My station broke a huge story
back in 1979.

670
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:36,205
A few years ago,
the producer of that 1979 report

671
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:38,676
came to see me at KNBC,
and he said,

672
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:43,246
"There is a lot more to the
story that we broke back in '79.

673
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,115
You have to continue
our work.

674
00:34:45,117 --> 00:34:46,384
You have to dig deeper."

675
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:48,252
You might be wondering
why we should care about

676
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,055
a nuclear accident that happened
more than half a century ago --

677
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:54,392
because, as you're
about to see,

678
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:56,193
thousands of people
in the San Fernando

679
00:34:56,195 --> 00:34:59,062
and Simi valleys
have been secretly exposed

680
00:34:59,131 --> 00:35:01,464
to dangerous
radioactive fallout.

681
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:04,200
It was pretty clear to me
that there were people

682
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:08,272
inside certain government
agencies, like the DTSC,

683
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:11,875
who were very close
with Boeing.

684
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,278
Tucker: That was a very
effective way for Boeing

685
00:35:14,346 --> 00:35:16,946
to buy protection
for themselves.

686
00:35:17,015 --> 00:35:18,615
I was looking into
the Department

687
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:20,483
of Toxic
Substances Control,

688
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:24,888
and I decided to look into, how
is it really regulating toxins?

689
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,690
And we did get
very revealing material

690
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:32,495
that showed us that the DTSC is
what I call a "captured agency."

691
00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:33,896
It's captured
by the polluters

692
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:35,898
but it's actually
supposed to be regulating.

00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:37,100
Insiders at the

694

Substance Control.

695
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:42,372
Told us that they were often
too lenient with polluters

696
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,207
who didn't clean up
contamination.

697
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:46,710
Boeing maintains
that there have been

698
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:51,515
no adverse health impacts from
contamination at Santa Susanna.

699
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:54,517
The DTSC has, while admitting
the contamination

700
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,052
has gotten off site,

701
00:35:56,054 --> 00:35:58,454
they'll say "it's not
getting off site at levels

702
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:00,190
that are harmful
to human health."

703
00:36:00,259 --> 00:36:01,691
And that's just
not true.

704
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:05,762
Tucker: Polluters are very adept
at flattering regulators,

705
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,531
at grooming them,

706
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,400
taking them by the hand
when they didn't know that much.

707
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:11,801
Kind of showed them
the direction

708
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,503
of what they wanted things
to look like.

709
00:36:13,572 --> 00:36:17,073
I also, as you know,
represent many private companies

710
00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:19,842
who have also found [indistinct]
to be balanced,

711
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:23,279
to be thorough, and to be just
as open as she claims to be.

712
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:26,049
Santa Susanna is kind of
a textbook civics lesson

713
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:27,751
in the way
government works.

714
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:29,820
People work in government
on an issue --

715
00:36:29,888 --> 00:36:33,023
in this case, Santa Susanna --
and then, they leave government,

716
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:35,725
and they can make a lot
more money becoming a lobbyist

717
00:36:35,727 --> 00:36:37,594
for the company
involved in the issue --

718
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:38,895
In this case, Boeing.

719
00:36:38,964 --> 00:36:43,633
The flotilla of fixers
that were hired by Boeing,

720
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:46,769
many of them had direct
connections to Jerry Brown,

721
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:48,271
or had worked for him.

722
00:36:48,273 --> 00:36:51,041
Reporter: It's been like a game
of musical chairs.

723
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:53,910
A former environmental aide
to Governor Brown,

724
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:56,446
a former head
of the state EPA,

725
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:59,550
and the former chief lawyer
of the DTSC,

726
00:36:59,618 --> 00:37:03,186
have all switched sides,
and worked on behalf of Boeing

727
00:37:03,255 --> 00:37:05,456
to kill a full cleanup
of Santa Susanna.

728
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:07,123
The Santa Susanna
Field Laboratory

729
00:37:07,192 --> 00:37:09,593
is a really
complex cleanup.

730
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:11,594
It costs
a lot of money.

731
00:37:11,663 --> 00:37:13,663
And any time
it costs a lot of money,

732
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:16,866
there's going to be
politics at play.

733
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:18,601
That leads to delay.

734
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:23,139
In 2007, there was a consent
order signed between the DTSC

735
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:25,408
and the responsible parties

736
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:29,079
that basically did not establish
much of a cleanup standard.

737
00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:30,480
It was very weak.

738
00:37:30,482 --> 00:37:32,682
And it was exactly
what Boeing wanted.

739
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:37,820
Duffield:
A recreational space cleanup,
which is what Boeing is pushing,

740
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:41,090
is based off of people being
on a site very infrequently.

741
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:43,560
That would result in 98%
of the contamination

742
00:37:43,562 --> 00:37:44,562
not being cleaned up.

743
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:46,763
People who live near
Santa Susanna

744
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:48,699
do not live
in recreational areas.

745
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,434
They live in
residential areas.

746
00:37:50,502 --> 00:37:53,571
All through the 2000s,
there was an effort

747
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:55,038
to require full cleanup.

748
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,106
Then-state senator
Sheila Kuehl

749
00:37:57,175 --> 00:37:58,307
represented the area.

750
00:37:58,377 --> 00:38:00,010
Introduced bill
after bill.

751
00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:02,378
Workers and neighbors
have become sick,

752
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:03,781
and too many
have died.

753
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:07,483
It's time to require
full and complete cleanup.

754
00:38:07,552 --> 00:38:11,254
I ask for your "aye" vote
on SB-990.

755
00:38:11,323 --> 00:38:15,125
And in 2007, she finally got
her legislation through.

756
00:38:15,193 --> 00:38:17,060
Tucker: Believe it or not,
under Schwarzenegger,

757
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:20,663
there was an actual serious
effort to clean up that site.

758
00:38:20,732 --> 00:38:23,100
But after Governor Brown
came to office,

759
00:38:23,168 --> 00:38:25,134
things shifted
very dramatically.

760
00:38:25,203 --> 00:38:28,606
Boeing, however, went to court
to overturn the law.

761
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:31,775
And through some exceedingly
troubling action

762
00:38:31,843 --> 00:38:35,411
by the Brown administration,
that lawsuit was lost.

763
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:40,016
Within five weeks of Jerry Brown
being sworn in, in 2011,

764
00:38:40,085 --> 00:38:42,618
a secret stipulation
was entered into

765
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:46,222
between the state and Boeing
in that lawsuit.

766
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:49,026
The state of California
actually stipulated

767
00:38:49,094 --> 00:38:53,229
that they would not contest
any material fact

768
00:38:53,231 --> 00:38:55,565
that Boeing would put forward
in the suit.

769
00:38:55,634 --> 00:38:57,367
And they actually agreed
to that stipulation,

770
00:38:57,435 --> 00:39:00,370
it's my understanding,
before ever having seen

771
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:03,106
the material facts that
Boeing was going to put forward.

772
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:06,709
The judge found it very easy
to overturn the law.

773
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:09,980
The state waived the right
to dispute anything

774
00:39:10,048 --> 00:39:11,648
that Boeing might say

775
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:13,850
without knowing
what those things would be.

776
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,518
It was a major blow.

777
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:17,653
And it was exactly
what Boeing wanted.

778
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:19,255
And they got it.

779
00:39:19,257 --> 00:39:21,758
There are those that think your
agency is too cozy with Boeing.

780
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:22,793
I haven't seen it,

781
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:24,126
And I've looked
for it.

782
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:26,329
NASA and the Department
of Energy

783
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:30,300
also signed 2010 agreements
with the State of California.

784
00:39:30,302 --> 00:39:33,404
And these were actually
really historic agreements.

785
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:34,905
And what they do is,

786
00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:37,807
they say the Santa Susanna
Field Laboratory

787
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:40,243
has to be cleaned up
to background levels.

788
00:39:40,312 --> 00:39:41,945
And essentially,
what that means is that,

789
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:44,548
if there's contamination
on site, it gets cleaned up.

790
00:39:44,616 --> 00:39:47,084
From your vantage point,
what is the status

791
00:39:47,152 --> 00:39:50,688
of NASA's actions,
with respect to the cleanup?

792
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:52,889
Yes, Congressman, all the
information you just relayed,

793
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:55,158
it is my understanding,
as well, that's where we are.

794
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,093
And NASA's committed
to fulfilling

795
00:39:57,095 --> 00:39:59,262
our obligations
under the AOC.

796
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,030
I'm tired of fighting.

797
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:03,833
Let's clean up
the background.

798
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,735
Let's get
this site closed.

799
00:40:05,804 --> 00:40:07,437
Yes, things happen.

800
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:09,239
Yes, they are unfortunate.

801
00:40:09,307 --> 00:40:11,974
And we've made a commitment
to clean it up.

802
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:14,911
That cleanup was supposed to
already have been concluded

803
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:16,646
by 2017.

804
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:18,714
And Boeing
and the federal agencies

805
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:21,017
have ensured
it hasn't even started.

806
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:23,119
And I'm certain that
these federal agencies

807
00:40:23,188 --> 00:40:25,321
do not want to set
a precedent,

808
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:29,492
in terms of really cleaning up
to a proper standard.

809
00:40:29,561 --> 00:40:33,664
And what happens when you cut
your corners on safety is

810
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:35,065
you kill people.

811
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:38,935
And that's exactly what
Boeing did with the 737 MAX.

812
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,203
That is their style.

813
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:43,606
The Department of Energy,
NASA, and Boeing

814
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:46,809
have made repeated promises
to clean it up,

815
00:40:46,878 --> 00:40:49,879
as has the state Toxics agency
that oversees them.

816
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:52,616
And those promises have been
broken over and over again.

817
00:40:52,684 --> 00:40:56,019
Will anyone from your agency
talk to us at all?

818
00:40:56,021 --> 00:40:57,620
My policy people
have talked to you.

819
00:40:57,689 --> 00:40:59,655
We've made a commitment
to clean it up.

820
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:01,290
I've said all
I'm going to say.

821
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,693
At the end of the day, because
it's the right thing to do.

822
00:41:03,762 --> 00:41:06,362
You've said nothing.

823
00:41:06,364 --> 00:41:10,266
And that means that there
have been years and years

824
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:13,669
of additional migration possible
that wouldn't have been possible

825
00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:15,672
if they had lived up
to their commitments.

826
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,307
It's my commitment to the people
of California that,

827
00:41:18,376 --> 00:41:19,710
when I'm gone,

828
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:22,846
I've left in place a system
that is robust,

829
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:26,282
defensible, and meaningful
for the future.

830
00:41:26,351 --> 00:41:27,650
Can you see how
some people

831
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:31,087
would think this is
more lip service?

832
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,088
I would hope
they wouldn't.

833
00:41:50,942 --> 00:41:55,612
Woman: You're going about
everything is different.rom,

834
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:02,886
And it is truly
the biggest nightmare

835
00:42:02,954 --> 00:42:04,821
any parent
could ever imagine.

836
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:11,794
¶¶

837
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:15,898
Duffield: In 2006, there was
a cluster of retinoblastoma.

838
00:42:15,967 --> 00:42:19,168
This is a rare eye cancer
affecting young children.

839
00:42:19,237 --> 00:42:22,972
There is just under 300
diagnosed in the United States,

840
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:26,109
and there were 11 cases
right near the site.

841
00:42:26,111 --> 00:42:28,044
We have very,
very strong evidence

842
00:42:28,113 --> 00:42:29,912
that the first group
of mothers

843
00:42:29,914 --> 00:42:33,583
whose children suffered from
retinoblastoma did sue Boeing,

844
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:34,917
and did settle,

845
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:36,286
and as part of
that settlement,

846
00:42:36,354 --> 00:42:39,790
were no longer allowed to talk
to the media, or get involved.

847
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:43,159
If you have a child with cancer,
it's very expensive.

848
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:46,362
I know one mother in particular
I talked to recently who,

849
00:42:46,364 --> 00:42:49,665
their family is bankrupt, now,
caring for their daughter.

850
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:53,003
So, I can understand,
if I was one of those mothers,

851
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:56,272
why they might have went
with that agreement.

852
00:42:56,341 --> 00:43:01,744
And now, several years later,
we're seeing new cases

853
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:04,348
of pediatric cancers
that are near the site.

854
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:07,283
Any amount of exposure
to some increased risk

855
00:43:07,285 --> 00:43:08,618
over background cancer,

856
00:43:08,687 --> 00:43:10,953
particularly for pregnant women
and children.

857
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:14,790
Dodge: The [Indistinct] report,
which came out in 2006,

858
00:43:14,859 --> 00:43:18,028
that landmark study
ended up showing

859
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:20,363
that there is no linear
threshold --

860
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:24,701
that any level, any level of
radionuclide exposure

861
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:26,335
above background

862
00:43:26,404 --> 00:43:28,838
had an inherent increased risk
of cancer.

863
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:35,444
There is a dramatic increase
in very rare and bizarre cancers

864
00:43:35,513 --> 00:43:39,816
that typically may happen
a few times across the nation.

865
00:43:39,884 --> 00:43:42,518
And what we've been noting
over the years is,

866
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,653
we have children --

867
00:43:43,655 --> 00:43:47,790
not one, but two, or three,
or four children

868
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:52,061
within the community
surrounding the test lab

869
00:43:52,063 --> 00:43:53,597
have these
unusual cancers.

870
00:43:53,665 --> 00:43:57,133
Hirsch: Boeing itself
did risk assessments

871
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:58,401
of what the risk
would be

872
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:01,103
if someone were to live
on the property.

873
00:44:01,172 --> 00:44:03,706
And their own estimate
for some of the locations

874
00:44:03,775 --> 00:44:05,207
was that the cancer risk

875
00:44:05,276 --> 00:44:08,878
was as high as 96
out of 100 --

876
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:10,546
meaning, if 100 people
live there,

877
00:44:10,548 --> 00:44:12,816
96 would get cancer
from the contamination.

878
00:44:12,884 --> 00:44:15,418
The EPA and DTSC
normally require

879
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,387
that the risk be kept at
one in a million.

880
00:44:18,456 --> 00:44:21,023
So, you can see how serious
the contamination is,

881
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:23,859
and how large the problem
would be if they left it behind.

882
00:44:23,928 --> 00:44:27,096
Man:
We found documents that show the
radiation has moved off site,

883
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:29,965
including at
the Brandeis-Bardin Institute.

884
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:31,500
Bycel:
My name is Lee Bycel,

885
00:44:31,569 --> 00:44:34,370
and I was the president
of the Brandeis-Bardin Institute

886
00:44:34,372 --> 00:44:37,941
from spring of 2000
to June of 2003.

887
00:44:37,943 --> 00:44:41,777
Prior to accepting the job,
I asked the chair of the board

888
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:44,413
if there was anything
that I needed to be worry about.

889
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:46,649
And she said,
"It's all good.

890
00:44:46,718 --> 00:44:49,986
We've had a settlement,
and everything in that land

891
00:44:49,988 --> 00:44:52,756
has been cleaned up, and
there's nothing to worry about."

892
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:55,524
I think one of the most
surprising documents

893
00:44:55,593 --> 00:44:59,930
we unearthed was an internal
report commissioned by the camp

894
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:04,066
that proved there was a lot of
contamination from Santa Susanna

895
00:45:04,135 --> 00:45:06,402
that ran down into
this children's camp.

896
00:45:06,471 --> 00:45:08,904
And it was the basis
for the camp

897
00:45:08,973 --> 00:45:11,407
suing the owners
of the field lab,

898
00:45:11,476 --> 00:45:14,277
and then secretly settling
that lawsuit.

899
00:45:14,345 --> 00:45:16,747
So, when I hear about
a settlement,

900
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:19,415
what comes to mind is that
there's liability there.

901
00:45:19,484 --> 00:45:22,251
We don't often want to hear
the dark side of things.

902
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,022
We don't often want to hear
that there's something wrong.

903
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:27,089
They have not
been transparent

904
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:29,892
in exactly what's going on
up there -- even now.

905
00:45:29,961 --> 00:45:34,997
How can one person be diagnosed
with thyroid cancer at age 4,

906
00:45:34,999 --> 00:45:36,900
with two recurrences,

907
00:45:36,968 --> 00:45:40,303
and then end up with
an extremely rare uterine cancer

908
00:45:40,371 --> 00:45:44,306
with no family history
of any kind?

909
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:47,777
Kowalski: We were four women,
were all cancer-free.

910
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:53,249
And now, fast forward,
we're only one cancer-free.

911
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:56,852
I had stage three to four
bladder cancer.

912
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:58,088
I just was shocked.

913
00:45:58,156 --> 00:46:00,656
And then,
I was so angry.

914
00:46:00,725 --> 00:46:05,361
My mother was diagnosed
with glioblastoma in 2001.

915
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:09,599
She passed away seven weeks
later, at the age of 58.

916
00:46:09,667 --> 00:46:13,669
And my father was diagnosed with
chronic lymphocytic leukemia

917
00:46:13,738 --> 00:46:14,671
in 2003.

918
00:46:14,739 --> 00:46:17,474
He passed away
in 2010.

919
00:46:17,542 --> 00:46:19,742
Tyler: My middle sister
developed a goiter

920
00:46:19,811 --> 00:46:21,277
when she was
11 years old.

921
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:24,346
And that later turned into
thyroid cancer.

922
00:46:24,415 --> 00:46:28,351
My father survived his cancer,
and my mother suffered

923
00:46:28,353 --> 00:46:31,954
with ovarian cancer
and colon cancer.

924
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:33,155
And she couldn't take it,

925
00:46:33,224 --> 00:46:36,793
so my mom actually ended up
committing suicide.

926
00:46:36,861 --> 00:46:39,695
My oldest sister was diagnosed
with brain cancer

927
00:46:39,697 --> 00:46:41,897
and glioblastoma.

928
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:44,533
As she was dying,
two years later,

929
00:46:44,602 --> 00:46:47,504
her own daughter was diagnosed
with cancer, too.

930
00:46:47,572 --> 00:46:53,943
And she passed just eight months
after my sister.

931
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:57,713
To hear that your child
has a life-threatening disease

932
00:46:57,782 --> 00:46:59,915
absolutely shakes you
to your core.

933
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:02,384
It was really, really
devastating to the family.

934
00:47:02,453 --> 00:47:04,486
Every day, it was like
the rug was

935
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:06,255
being taken out
from under us.

936
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:09,859
Our world ended
on that day.

937
00:47:09,861 --> 00:47:14,396
And this new reality
had to come into existence.

938
00:47:14,465 --> 00:47:15,931
I thought she was
gonna beat it.

939
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,066
I really did.

940
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:21,538
She didn't.

941
00:47:24,709 --> 00:47:28,144
I think we're just
in denial.

942
00:47:28,146 --> 00:47:30,279
Endy: Which is a beautiful
thing, to be in denial,

943
00:47:30,281 --> 00:47:35,018
because you get to enjoy
every moment, you know?

944
00:47:35,086 --> 00:47:37,287
So, that's the
best thing.

945
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:40,156
¶¶

946
00:47:40,158 --> 00:47:42,558
Huff:
I can't just leave.

947
00:47:42,627 --> 00:47:44,560
It's hard to
give everything up

948
00:47:44,629 --> 00:47:46,762
because somebody can't do
the right thing.

949
00:47:46,831 --> 00:47:49,498
Where do you go that
you really know you're safe?

950
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:52,568
You know, I mean, I moved here
thinking I was safe.

951
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:53,836
And why should we leave?

952
00:47:53,905 --> 00:47:55,638
We came here
in good faith.

953
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:56,872
Why should we leave?

954
00:47:56,941 --> 00:47:58,674
They need to
clean up their crap.

955
00:48:00,979 --> 00:48:04,513
You can't sit back,
and pretend it's not real.

956
00:48:04,582 --> 00:48:06,116
You have to
do something.

957
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:11,188
Woman: Who is the person
who could make a difference

958
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:12,455
in all of this?

959
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,861
Who can make
a difference?

960
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:34,945
Melissa: I'm never
not thinking about it.

961
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:37,279
And I'm never not thinking about
how we can --

962
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:39,615
we can change things because
it's not only my community

963
00:48:39,684 --> 00:48:40,883
I'm trying to protect.

964
00:48:40,885 --> 00:48:42,018
I mean, we live here.

965
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:43,887
My -- My kids live here.

966
00:48:43,955 --> 00:48:46,355
Okay, Grace, you ready?
Look both ways.

967
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:49,692
Good. Let's cross.

968
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,959
I will not.

969
00:48:51,029 --> 00:48:54,164
I never thought I was smart
growing up.

970
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:55,698
I never trusted myself

971
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,166
and I never really
valued myself.

972
00:48:57,168 --> 00:48:58,233
One of your presents,

973
00:48:58,302 --> 00:49:01,170
you're gonna want
to open sooner.

974
00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:04,773
I do feel
incredibly small.

975
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,575
And it's hard to say that
because

976
00:49:06,577 --> 00:49:09,379
with that comes
the lack of control that I feel.

977
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:18,255
When Gracie got diagnosed,

978
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:20,222
there was this one moment
in the hospital

979
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:23,392
where, you know, she had
a port underneath her skin

980
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:25,260
and they had to pierce the port
with a needle

981
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:27,730
to get her, you know, chemo
or blood transfusions

982
00:49:27,732 --> 00:49:29,399
or whatever it was she needed.

983
00:49:29,467 --> 00:49:31,801
But they had a very specific
process of cleaning

984
00:49:31,869 --> 00:49:33,469
and sterilizing
all the equipment

985
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:35,004
before you attach the two.

986
00:49:35,006 --> 00:49:36,172
And I had, two days earlier,

987
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,108
had had a huge lesson
on how to do it properly

988
00:49:39,177 --> 00:49:42,344
because we had to
do that at home.

989
00:49:42,413 --> 00:49:45,748
And we're in the operating room,

990
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:48,984
and I saw the nurse
wipe it twice.

991
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:51,754
And they were supposed to do
at least 10 seconds of that.

992
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:55,824
And then they're supposed to
let it dry for 20 seconds.

993
00:49:55,893 --> 00:49:58,227
And in that one second,
I realized,

994
00:49:58,295 --> 00:50:00,630
"I need to say something.
I need to stop this woman,

995
00:50:00,698 --> 00:50:02,498
because if she does that
and there's bacteria,

996
00:50:02,567 --> 00:50:04,133
it can go straight
into Gracie's bloodstream

997
00:50:04,202 --> 00:50:07,938
through her heart,
it can kill her."

998
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:10,173
In that same exact second,
I thought,

999
00:50:10,241 --> 00:50:11,640
"If I say something,
she'll say,

1000
00:50:11,709 --> 00:50:12,875
'What do you know?
You're not trained.

1001
00:50:12,944 --> 00:50:13,976
I'm a nurse, you're not.
How dare you.

1002
00:50:14,045 --> 00:50:15,578
I'm an authority figure.
You're not.

1003
00:50:15,646 --> 00:50:17,180
I'm gonna embarrass you
for bringing this up

1004
00:50:17,248 --> 00:50:18,581
and rocking the boat.'"

1005
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:27,089
And as she's going together,

1006
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:29,925
I didn't --
I didn't do anything.

1007
00:50:29,994 --> 00:50:31,827
Because I ended up
being more afraid

1008
00:50:31,896 --> 00:50:36,031
of what she would say
than protecting my daughter.

1009
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,733
And thank God nothing happened,

1010
00:50:37,802 --> 00:50:40,602
but I swore that moment

1011
00:50:40,671 --> 00:50:42,805
I will never,
ever let my children

1012
00:50:42,874 --> 00:50:46,041
be put in danger because
I was too scared to speak up.

1013
00:50:48,746 --> 00:50:51,348
And I think that was the day
I decided

1014
00:50:51,415 --> 00:50:52,948
I'm gonna hurt either way.

1015
00:50:53,017 --> 00:50:54,216
I might as well
make a difference.

1016
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:57,086
I have
Melissa Bumstead.

1017
00:50:57,155 --> 00:50:59,187
-Melissa Bumstead...
-Melissa Bumstead...

1018
00:50:59,257 --> 00:51:03,158
I hope I'm not talking too fast,
but I'm pretty nervous.

1019
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:04,961
This is alarming,
and we are concerned --

1020
00:51:04,963 --> 00:51:06,429
the cancer moms in my community.

1021
00:51:06,497 --> 00:51:08,330
I mean, these children
are on my street.

1022
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:09,632
I've had it.

1023
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:17,640
[ Singing indistinctly ]

1024
00:51:17,708 --> 00:51:20,142
A group of seven mothers and I,

1025
00:51:20,211 --> 00:51:22,044
not really understanding
what we were doing,

1026
00:51:22,113 --> 00:51:23,679
came to our first DTSC,

1027
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,514
Department of
Toxic Substance Control,

1028
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:27,616
meeting to find out
what is wrong?

1029
00:51:27,618 --> 00:51:29,451
Are we in danger?

1030
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:31,887
And that was the first day
I realized we are in danger.

1031
00:51:31,956 --> 00:51:33,856
Through the change.org petition,

1032
00:51:33,858 --> 00:51:36,658
we started to get traction
and people started to care,

1033
00:51:36,727 --> 00:51:39,028
and I realized we weren't
alone in this fight.

1034
00:51:42,133 --> 00:51:44,400
We're here because of numerous
failures of regulators

1035
00:51:44,402 --> 00:51:45,534
to protect the public.

1036
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:47,002
Reasonable people look at this
and say

1037
00:51:47,004 --> 00:51:48,538
"This -- This should not
be happening."

1038
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:49,972
I got up there
and I was shaking my hand.

1039
00:51:49,974 --> 00:51:51,607
"How dare you do this
to my community?

1040
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:54,009
You have lied about this,
tried to confuse all of us.

1041
00:51:54,078 --> 00:51:55,477
Why would you do this to us?"

1042
00:51:55,546 --> 00:51:56,979
Because it's cheaper for Boeing

1043
00:51:57,048 --> 00:51:59,748
to pay the relatively measly
fees your board imposes

1044
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:01,350
than to clean up their mess.

1045
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:03,420
You regulate Boeing,
not the other way around.

1046
00:52:03,487 --> 00:52:05,320
We are a force
to be reckoned with.

was his home ¶

1049
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,364
I've really changed.
I've really healed.

1050
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:18,033
And now I'm willing to
have confrontation,

1051
00:52:18,102 --> 00:52:19,468
not for confrontation's sake,

1052
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:22,504
but to protect people
that I care about.

1053
00:52:22,573 --> 00:52:25,841
You know, I still
wanted to throw up afterwards.

1054
00:52:25,843 --> 00:52:27,075
She's always been fierce.

1055
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:29,545
Her motivation to never stop

1056
00:52:29,547 --> 00:52:31,113
just keeps getting stronger
and stronger.

1057
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:33,515
Melissa Bumstead
is a superhero.

1058
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:34,717
I've never met
anyone like her.

1059
00:52:34,785 --> 00:52:36,185
She's the face of this cleanup.

1060
00:52:36,187 --> 00:52:37,452
She's got to keep going.

1061
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:39,989
People like Melissa will
change the tide of this fight,

1062
00:52:40,057 --> 00:52:41,924
and I know that
she has changed it already.

1063
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:45,227
There's nothing like a mom
wanting to protect her children.

1064
00:52:45,297 --> 00:52:48,330
There's no force on Earth
that is more powerful.

1065
00:52:48,399 --> 00:52:51,400
Melissa: My daughter went
through excruciating pain,

1066
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:54,770
and she buried two
of her friends last year.

1067
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:58,173
We are praying to God
that we finally get the cleanup

1068
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:00,008
because sometimes
I can't sleep at night

1069
00:53:00,077 --> 00:53:03,011
worrying that my children
are in danger.

1070
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:05,014
And I know that
I'm not the only one.

1071
00:53:14,425 --> 00:53:17,060
Esparza: But what people maybe
don't remember

1072
00:53:17,127 --> 00:53:21,363
is that we're fitting a lifetime
into a year

1073
00:53:21,432 --> 00:53:23,432
or two
or three or five.

1074
00:53:23,434 --> 00:53:24,766
-Yes.
-And that, you know...

1075
00:53:24,835 --> 00:53:27,436
-So powerful, Gillian.
-...predict the future.

1076
00:53:27,438 --> 00:53:30,105
And that's true.
It's true for all of us.

1077
00:53:30,107 --> 00:53:32,341
Hammersley: One of the things
that I wish we could have done

1078
00:53:32,343 --> 00:53:35,912
because she was in the process
of getting a second wish granted

1079
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:39,982
and her wish was to go was to go
to Kleinfeld's in New York

1080
00:53:39,984 --> 00:53:42,185
and try on wedding dresses
because her favorite show

1081
00:53:42,253 --> 00:53:44,319
was "Say Yes to the Dress."
-Right.

1082
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:46,688
And we would watch it
in the hospital all the time.

1083
00:53:46,757 --> 00:53:49,325
And we got approved
and we were planning it

1084
00:53:49,327 --> 00:53:52,594
in January of last year.

1085
00:53:52,663 --> 00:53:54,530
And we were gonna
try to go in April.

1086
00:53:54,532 --> 00:53:55,932
Yeah.

1087
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,868
But --
But she didn't get to,

1088
00:53:58,936 --> 00:54:01,770
and it sometimes is really hard
because I go, "Gosh,

1089
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:03,538
she never got
to try on a wedding dress.

1090
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:08,810
She never -- She'll never get to
walk down the aisle."

1091
00:54:08,879 --> 00:54:11,279
Like you said, we're trying
to fit in a lifetime.

1092
00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:14,216
Right.
In just a small
number of years,

1093
00:54:14,285 --> 00:54:17,287
and that's --
that's so powerful.

1094
00:54:17,354 --> 00:54:24,494
¶¶

1095
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:28,230
The day she passed away,
my husband and I,

1096
00:54:28,299 --> 00:54:32,000
we weren't -- we weren't ready
to go home.

1097
00:54:32,069 --> 00:54:34,370
We left her at the hospital
and that was the hardest thing

1098
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:38,573
we ever had to do
was to leave there without her.

1099
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:41,311
It was so hard
to trust in anything,

1100
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:45,447
because all you feel
is that tangible loss.

1101
00:54:45,516 --> 00:54:48,917
Keep praying and stay strong.

1102
00:54:52,589 --> 00:54:55,423
Hammersley: I tried to get to
a protest the other day,

1103
00:54:55,493 --> 00:54:59,194
but my body wouldn't let me.

1104
00:54:59,196 --> 00:55:01,596
Melissa and I
tell each other all the time,

1105
00:55:01,665 --> 00:55:03,999
like, "Just do what you can,
and that's okay.

1106
00:55:04,068 --> 00:55:06,134
And don't feel bad."

1107
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:08,671
But it was hard because
I continued to feel guilty

1108
00:55:08,739 --> 00:55:10,405
because I was like,

1109
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:15,744
"This -- This fight doesn't stop
just because I do."

1110
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:20,550
But watching what Melissa
has done over this last year

1111
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:23,285
has just been remarkable.

1112
00:55:25,556 --> 00:55:27,756
Being a mom is hard enough.

1113
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:31,327
Being a mom of a childhood
cancer makes it harder.

1114
00:55:31,395 --> 00:55:34,162
Then being a mom who's trying
to protect all the kids

1115
00:55:34,231 --> 00:55:38,568
in her community from
some insidious exposure --

1116
00:55:38,635 --> 00:55:42,371
the level of responsibility
you end up taking on and feeling

1117
00:55:42,373 --> 00:55:48,310
is daunting and draining
and overwhelming.

1118
00:55:48,379 --> 00:55:50,746
I've seen the toll
that it's taken on her

1119
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:54,583
because it's frustrating
when people don't listen.

1120
00:55:54,585 --> 00:55:56,351
But she still gets up
and she still fights,

1121
00:55:56,420 --> 00:56:01,189
and she still
is pushing so hard

1122
00:56:01,258 --> 00:56:03,325
because she's watched
her friends

1123
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,927
bury their children.

1124
00:56:04,929 --> 00:56:12,068
¶¶

1125
00:56:12,136 --> 00:56:19,375
¶¶

1126
00:56:24,481 --> 00:56:31,486
Duffield: Melissa is the key
to the cleanup.

1127
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:37,759
Melissa now is leading
the community in this effort,

1128
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:41,497
and her voice is critical

1129
00:56:41,499 --> 00:56:43,166
and the leadership
that she's shown

1130
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,834
in organizing her community
is critical,

1131
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:50,506
and that will make
or break everything.

1132
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:57,447
Anything else that is worth
putting a flag on?

1133
00:56:57,514 --> 00:56:59,781
I was thinking
something like this

1134
00:56:59,783 --> 00:57:02,184
might even be good
to put out to the community

1135
00:57:02,186 --> 00:57:04,052
who are trying to figure out
how to message it

1136
00:57:04,054 --> 00:57:05,321
to hit the right target,

1137
00:57:05,389 --> 00:57:07,590
and we don't really know
what the right next target is.

1138
00:57:07,658 --> 00:57:10,459
Right.
And then randomly,
she had an idea...

1139
00:57:10,461 --> 00:57:14,529
Hirsch: I admire Melissa
more than I can begin to say.

1140
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:16,665
She's taken
this personal tragedy

1141
00:57:16,734 --> 00:57:19,202
and used that as motivation

1142
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:22,271
and energy to try
to protect others.

1143
00:57:22,339 --> 00:57:24,673
And I've been in meetings
where Melissa and Grace

1144
00:57:24,742 --> 00:57:27,642
have gone to meet
with state senators,

1145
00:57:27,711 --> 00:57:30,278
and they touched their hearts
some.

1146
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,615
It becomes much easier to do
what a polluter wants you to do

1147
00:57:33,684 --> 00:57:35,817
if you don't see
who gets hurt from it.

1148
00:57:35,886 --> 00:57:38,020
Duffield: We really have to
look to our decision makers

1149
00:57:38,088 --> 00:57:41,089
to commit to us that the site
will be fully cleaned up

1150
00:57:41,158 --> 00:57:44,493
in a timely manner and that
they will make that a priority.

1151
00:57:44,495 --> 00:57:45,861
How did you feel
about the meeting, Melissa?

1152
00:57:51,835 --> 00:57:54,837
These hundreds of thousands
of signatures on the petition

1153
00:57:54,905 --> 00:57:56,972
have turned things around
quite a bit.

1154
00:57:57,041 --> 00:57:58,174

Okay, and so what if they say
he's not ready to sign?

00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:30,071
Like they already know
he's not ready to sign?

that he might go to immediately

Hey, hon.

1178
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:29,597
Melissa: I got a call from
John Cox's campaign manager.

1179
00:59:29,667 --> 00:59:31,533
They weren't really making
a huge effort,

1180
00:59:31,535 --> 00:59:33,935
and now it's four days
before the election,

1181
00:59:34,004 --> 00:59:36,005
and all of a sudden
they're, like, hounding me

1182
00:59:36,073 --> 00:59:39,475
to come to host this thing
where Cox can step in

1183
00:59:39,543 --> 00:59:41,878
with all these,
you know, crying cancer moms.

1184
00:59:41,945 --> 00:59:44,613
And it was just so much pressure
in such a short amount of time

1185
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:46,081
to try to figure things out.

1186
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:47,882
You know, Denise has been great
and she's saying,

1187
00:59:47,951 --> 00:59:50,019
"Melissa, you know, in the end,
this has to be your call

1188
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:51,621
because this is your community

1189
00:59:51,688 --> 00:59:53,756
and you need to do
what you feel is right."

1190
00:59:53,824 --> 00:59:55,625
And then Dan's going like,
"You can't do this.

1191
00:59:55,692 --> 01:00:00,095
You know, you're walking
into a trap," essentially.

1192
01:00:00,163 --> 01:00:02,030
And so when I got that word,

1193
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:03,431
I called them up and said,

1194
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:05,902
"I prayed about it.
I don't feel good about it.

01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:28,858
I just feel like
I don't know anything.

1205
01:00:28,925 --> 01:00:30,792
And then Dan saying, like --

1206
01:00:30,861 --> 01:00:32,728
I know he was trying to be nice,
but I kind of wish he hadn't.

1207
01:00:32,796 --> 01:00:35,063
He said, "You know, it's kind of
on your shoulders now, Melissa.

1208
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:37,599
You've got to make this happen
or we're all gonna lose."

1209
01:00:37,601 --> 01:00:39,401
And I was like...

1210
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:40,869
You know, some people
are trying to say, like,

1211
01:00:40,938 --> 01:00:43,071
"Oh, these people are using you
and these people are using you."

1212
01:00:43,073 --> 01:00:47,342
And I'm a very small person.

1213
01:00:47,344 --> 01:00:48,943
You know, I'm --

1214
01:00:49,012 --> 01:00:52,947
This is not what I thought
my life would be.

1215
01:00:53,016 --> 01:00:56,418
And I feel so little
and I feel so powerless

1216
01:00:56,486 --> 01:01:01,489
right now, and doesn't stop.

1217
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,826
And then I have these
little times of melting down,

1218
01:01:03,894 --> 01:01:07,830
and then I pack it up
and wash my face.

1219
01:01:07,898 --> 01:01:10,165
And then I go pick up
the kids from school

1220
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:11,733
and life just moves on.

1221
01:01:15,639 --> 01:01:17,238
I think that's all
I have to say.

1222
01:01:17,307 --> 01:01:23,645
¶¶

1223
01:01:23,713 --> 01:01:26,982
I've been dealing with
the Santa Susana facility

1224
01:01:26,984 --> 01:01:30,318
for 39 years.

1225
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:33,455
I tried to walk away
from the Santa Susana issue

1226
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:34,923
several years ago.

1227
01:01:34,992 --> 01:01:36,125
After the AOC was signed,

1228
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:38,993
I thought there was no real need
for me to continue,

1229
01:01:39,062 --> 01:01:40,996
it was gonna get cleaned up.

1230
01:01:40,998 --> 01:01:42,798
And then when
the Brown administration

1231
01:01:42,866 --> 01:01:46,801
started to undo it,
I failed at trying to stop them.

1232
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:51,473
But I have not been able
to somehow break what I feel

1233
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,608
is a promise I made
to those people.

1234
01:01:53,677 --> 01:01:56,946
Even though it was a promise I
had no idea could take so long.

1235
01:01:57,013 --> 01:02:00,215
Duffield: Santa Susana is not
for the faint-hearted.

1236
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:04,753
It's a long,
complicated struggle.

1237
01:02:04,755 --> 01:02:06,688
I'm an advocate.

1238
01:02:06,757 --> 01:02:08,890
We've been working for 30 years
with other groups

1239
01:02:08,892 --> 01:02:11,359
who've invested
a similar amount of time.

1240
01:02:11,428 --> 01:02:17,565
And so it's hard to not also
wonder, you know, what more --

1241
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:21,036
is there anything more
that could have been done?

1242
01:02:21,104 --> 01:02:24,139
Hirsch: It's a fight between
those who have conscience

1243
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:29,477
and those who whose concern
is primarily power and profit.

1244
01:02:29,545 --> 01:02:32,313
These fights never end.

1245
01:02:32,382 --> 01:02:35,450
And if you don't fight them,
you always lose.

1246
01:02:35,452 --> 01:02:44,993

¶¶

1249
01:03:04,214 --> 01:03:08,016
Reporter:
Right now, this fire is still
growing pretty quickly here,

1250
01:03:08,084 --> 01:03:11,920
blowing out of
the north-northeast.

1251
01:03:11,989 --> 01:03:16,491
And it's still continuing
at about 35 to 40 miles an hour.

1252
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:17,827
We're watching
and we're looking at

1253
01:03:17,894 --> 01:03:20,562
some of these hotspots out here,
and it is very disheartening

1254
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:23,498
for any of these folks
that are here living nearby.

1255
01:03:23,567 --> 01:03:28,738
¶¶

1256
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:31,539
Reporter #2: The Woolsey Fire,
now over 30000 acres burnt.

1257
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:33,374
Reporter #3: It's just
a monster, a nightmare out here.

1258
01:03:33,443 --> 01:03:36,110
Reporter #4:
This entire neighborhood
has been obliterated.

1259
01:03:36,112 --> 01:03:38,179
All the mountains
around here are scorched.

1260
01:03:38,181 --> 01:03:40,849
Reporter #5: Winds out here not
really helping the situation.

1261
01:03:40,851 --> 01:03:42,751
Reporter #6: This fire is fast.

1262
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:45,453
It is fueled by
those Santa Ana winds.

1263
01:03:45,523 --> 01:03:47,089
Reporter #7:
Flames continuing to burn.

1264
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:50,592
We have been this really
just run down the hillside.

1265
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:54,130
You really can see how vast
this wildfire is,

1266
01:03:54,197 --> 01:03:57,132
threatening tens of thousands
of homes.

1267
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:00,735
Reporter #8: Firefighters are
doing everything they can

1268
01:04:00,804 --> 01:04:02,537
to slow this thing down.

1269
01:04:02,606 --> 01:04:05,073
This fire here is still
being very stubborn.

1270
01:04:05,142 --> 01:04:07,877
Working its way out of
the Rocketdyne complex

1271
01:04:07,944 --> 01:04:09,811
over in the Bell Canyon.

1272
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:12,381
[ Speaks indistinctly ]

1273
01:04:12,449 --> 01:04:20,088
¶¶

1274
01:04:20,090 --> 01:04:23,425
And just see how terrible the
air quality is out here as well.

1275
01:04:23,427 --> 01:04:25,526
We had to get up to about
10,000 feet just to get some

1276
01:04:25,595 --> 01:04:28,730
clear air
to breathe around here.

1277
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:31,566
Our worst fear for 15 years,

1278
01:04:31,635 --> 01:04:33,901
that if a fire ever happened
at the lab,

1279
01:04:33,971 --> 01:04:36,038
it would be the easiest way
for those contaminants

1280
01:04:36,106 --> 01:04:37,572
to get to the public.

1281
01:04:37,641 --> 01:04:39,007
And here it's happened.

1282
01:04:47,584 --> 01:04:49,717
Reporter:
There are three questions
that we're investigating

1283
01:04:49,786 --> 01:04:51,819
about the devastating
Woolsey Fire --

1284
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:53,988
where and how
did the fire start,

1285
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:56,190
and is the smoke,
the smoke that is still

1286
01:04:56,259 --> 01:04:58,193
rising from the ground, toxic?

1287
01:04:58,262 --> 01:05:00,528
There is mounting evidence
that the fire started

1288
01:05:00,597 --> 01:05:02,464
at the Santa Susana Field Lab.

1289
01:05:02,532 --> 01:05:04,133
There is growing concern tonight

1290
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,801
over toxic fallout
from the Woolsey Fire.

1291
01:05:06,803 --> 01:05:08,202
Reporter #2:
Government officials say

1292
01:05:08,271 --> 01:05:10,205
testing shows the air is safe.

1293
01:05:10,273 --> 01:05:13,208
Some doctors and advocates
call that a smoke screen.

1294
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:15,677
Dodge: Smoke from any brush fire
is dangerous to inhale.

1295
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:18,747
In this case, with these added,
very hazardous elements,

1296
01:05:18,815 --> 01:05:19,947
it makes it far more dangerous.

1297
01:05:20,017 --> 01:05:21,050
Reporter #3: A statement today

1298
01:05:21,117 --> 01:05:23,484
from the Department of
Toxic Substances Control

1299
01:05:23,553 --> 01:05:25,087
says initial tests show...

1300
01:05:25,155 --> 01:05:27,055
Reporter #4: ...official news
release claimed there was no --

1301
01:05:27,124 --> 01:05:29,190
Reporter #3: ...no risk
to people living nearby.

1302
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:31,826
It did not appear
to be a hazard to the public.

1303
01:05:31,895 --> 01:05:34,496
No discernible signs of
radiation.

1304
01:05:34,564 --> 01:05:37,233
The potential hazard
of major release

1305
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:39,767
into the environment
was just not there.

1306
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:42,104
What was significant about
the Woolsey Fire

1307
01:05:42,172 --> 01:05:44,572
is that it started
on the property

1308
01:05:44,641 --> 01:05:47,275
of the Santa Susana
Field Laboratory.

1309
01:05:47,344 --> 01:05:52,848
It's very distressing
when you know how terribly

1310
01:05:52,916 --> 01:05:56,851
polluted it is to then turn on
the television

1311
01:05:56,853 --> 01:05:59,053
and see it in flames.

1312
01:05:59,122 --> 01:06:03,124
After the fire, you know,
80% of the site burned.

1313
01:06:03,126 --> 01:06:07,795
We have learned since then that
NASA took down tanks and piping

1314
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:11,532
and had moved a fire station
that, had they been in place,

1315
01:06:11,601 --> 01:06:13,435
could have put that fire out.

1316
01:06:13,503 --> 01:06:15,436
Regardless of what happens
to the site,

1317
01:06:15,438 --> 01:06:18,606
it's always going to be
in a fire-risk area.

1318
01:06:18,675 --> 01:06:22,343
So why one would remove
water tanks and piping,

1319
01:06:22,412 --> 01:06:23,679
I don't know.

1320
01:06:44,634 --> 01:06:48,137
Duffield: And after the fire,
DTSC released an interim report.

1321
01:06:48,204 --> 01:06:49,538
For them to release a report

1322
01:06:49,606 --> 01:06:52,308
that shows them doing
air monitoring after the fire

1323
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:53,875
is silly.

1324
01:06:53,944 --> 01:06:55,743
The greatest risk
was during a fire.

1325
01:06:55,745 --> 01:06:59,647
They have now admitted that
the burned vegetation

1326
01:06:59,716 --> 01:07:02,184
made the contaminants
in the soil more mobile,

1327
01:07:02,252 --> 01:07:05,887
and that's part of the reason
why we have these 57 exceedances

1328
01:07:05,955 --> 01:07:08,590
in storm water runoff
after the fire.

1329
01:07:08,658 --> 01:07:11,727
But the bottom line is
if it had been cleaned up

1330
01:07:11,795 --> 01:07:14,595
as it should have been by 2017,

1331
01:07:14,664 --> 01:07:16,865
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

1332
01:07:19,402 --> 01:07:21,869
Dodge: The vegetation on site
is contaminated.

1333
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:23,806
And as the vegetation burned,

1334
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:26,674
it then aerosolized high up
into the atmosphere

1335
01:07:26,743 --> 01:07:29,077
and then was able to spread
across the basin.

1336
01:07:29,079 --> 01:07:32,613
Our concern, admittedly
for the fire

1337
01:07:32,682 --> 01:07:34,015
was that the contamination

1338
01:07:34,017 --> 01:07:37,051
probably spread mainly
the toxic chemicals,

1339
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:39,188
which come from
the burning of fuels

1340
01:07:39,255 --> 01:07:41,356
and the rocket engine firings.

1341
01:07:41,358 --> 01:07:45,626
The dangerous levels of exposure
to chemical contaminants

1342
01:07:45,695 --> 01:07:48,630
somewhat follow a similar
pattern to the radionuclides.

1343
01:07:48,698 --> 01:07:50,966
Every level increases the risk.

1344
01:08:30,907 --> 01:08:32,408
My name is Mike Stenstrom.

1345
01:08:32,475 --> 01:08:34,675
I'm a member of
the expert panel.

1346
01:08:34,744 --> 01:08:37,612
And so I'd like to say that
we've been involved in this,

1347
01:08:37,681 --> 01:08:42,050
the panel has, since almost
the inception of the fire.

1348
01:08:42,052 --> 01:08:43,484
We are an independent panel.

1349
01:08:43,554 --> 01:08:47,288
We are funded by Boeing,

1350
01:08:47,357 --> 01:08:51,092
and we've been using
Geosyntec to assist us.

1351
01:08:51,161 --> 01:08:55,963
But, you see, there's a trend
of decreasing exceedances

1352
01:08:56,032 --> 01:08:57,900
as we move forward in time.

1353
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,901
Man: Concentrations over
the course of the season

1354
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:02,304
are returning
to pre-fire levels.

1355
01:09:02,372 --> 01:09:04,505
We have what we have here
is a lot of exceedances

1356
01:09:04,507 --> 01:09:07,909
in areas where you don't see
a lot of legacy contamination.

1357
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:09,812
So the system's
already recovering,

1358
01:09:09,879 --> 01:09:11,346
and we're happy about that.

1359
01:09:11,414 --> 01:09:13,181
My name is Denise Duffield.
I'm the associate director

1360
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:16,450
at Physicians for Social
Responsibility of Los Angeles.

1361
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:19,721
I feel like I'm living
in an alternate universe,

1362
01:09:19,723 --> 01:09:22,790
though, after this very
Orwellian presentation.

1363
01:09:22,859 --> 01:09:27,929
57 exceedances and violations
is astonishing.

1364
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:31,132
The expert panel
is paid by Boeing.

1365
01:09:31,201 --> 01:09:35,336
That begs a lot of credulity
on their independence.

1366
01:09:35,338 --> 01:09:37,406
It's an open, seeping wound
in our community

1367
01:09:37,473 --> 01:09:39,607
that threatens our public health
every time it rains

1368
01:09:39,676 --> 01:09:41,342
or the wind blows
or the fires burn.

1369
01:09:41,411 --> 01:09:42,543
I live in Simi Valley.

1370
01:09:42,545 --> 01:09:43,611
I have a 3-year-old.

1371
01:09:43,613 --> 01:09:45,813
I'm a Golden State Water
customer.

1372
01:09:45,882 --> 01:09:48,149
I've got groundwater
from below SSFL

1373
01:09:48,217 --> 01:09:50,385
being pumped into my home
with every bath,

1374
01:09:50,453 --> 01:09:52,087
with every meal.

1375
01:09:52,155 --> 01:09:54,223

my water source.

I'm a little disappointed today.

1379
01:10:03,966 --> 01:10:06,968
I had actually assumed
that it would be

1380
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:10,906
an independent panel,
expert panel speaking today.

1381
01:10:10,974 --> 01:10:13,307
I didn't know anything
about politics

1382
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:15,343
until the last five years,
and I've learned

1383
01:10:15,411 --> 01:10:17,744
that you always have
to follow the money.

1384
01:10:17,746 --> 01:10:21,616
That's the basic understanding
of how America works these days,

1385
01:10:21,684 --> 01:10:23,718
unfortunately,
and I was very disappointed.

1387
01:10:26,289 --> 01:10:28,657
is better than mine, hands down.

1388
01:10:28,725 --> 01:10:31,426
However,
that's not an independent panel,

1389
01:10:31,428 --> 01:10:33,394
and the people of Los Angeles
deserve better

1390
01:10:33,463 --> 01:10:36,865
on such a critically
important issue.

1391
01:10:36,933 --> 01:10:38,534
We've got a lot of facts.
We know the facts.

1392
01:10:38,601 --> 01:10:40,669
We're all
intelligent people here.

1393
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:44,205
But I think what is lacking is
courage to do the right thing.

1394
01:10:44,207 --> 01:10:47,475
And so I wanted to bring you
my daughter's beads of courage.

about nominal exceedances,

1398
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:08,229
but you need to understand that
these exceedances affect us.

1399
01:11:08,297 --> 01:11:10,198
We've come to find out
that our area

1400
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:13,901
is above the national average
for childhood cancers.

1401
01:11:13,971 --> 01:11:15,971
We've had several
who've passed away

1402
01:11:16,039 --> 01:11:17,905
and this is the cost
of exceedances,

1403
01:11:17,974 --> 01:11:20,975
and I really ask you
to have the courage

1404
01:11:20,977 --> 01:11:24,578

I grew up near the Field Lab.

1409

Thousands of people have lived
near the Field Lab,

1410
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:47,335
and most people
have never heard of it.

1411
01:11:47,403 --> 01:11:51,406
The Santa Susana issue
was almost dead,

1412
01:11:51,474 --> 01:11:55,543

a whole new round of attention.

1417

all because of tweets from
the Kardashians.

it blew up.

1429

it could be ripped out from
underneath us at any moment.

1438

1439

We clearly signed an agreement
for full cleanup.

is, oh, we did more work,

01:26:22,945 --> 01:26:26,146
that made this Facebook page,
I would've not known.

1707
01:26:26,215 --> 01:26:29,015
There's an endemic problem
with the whole system.

1708
01:26:29,084 --> 01:26:31,017
You can have wonderful
environmental laws

1709
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:32,886
and we have really
powerful ones,

1710
01:26:32,955 --> 01:26:34,755
but if they're not enforced,
they're useless.

1711
01:26:34,757 --> 01:26:37,191
And that has happened
at dozens and dozens

1712
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:39,393
of toxic sites in the state
of California

1713
01:26:39,461 --> 01:26:42,196
and probably is emblematic
of what goes on,

1714
01:26:42,264 --> 01:26:44,965
unfortunately,
all over the country.

1715
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:00,715
Woman:
The Committee on Oversight

1716
01:27:00,782 --> 01:27:03,316
and Investigations would
now come to order.

1717
01:27:03,318 --> 01:27:05,852
I would now like to introduce
the honorable Anne White,

1718
01:27:05,854 --> 01:27:07,254
who is the Assistant Secretary,

1719
01:27:07,323 --> 01:27:09,189
Office of Environmental
Management,

1720
01:27:09,191 --> 01:27:10,924
Department of Energy.

1721
01:27:10,993 --> 01:27:13,661
Madam Chair, the government's
nuclear defense programs

1722
01:27:13,729 --> 01:27:16,396
played an integral role
in ending World War II

1723
01:27:16,465 --> 01:27:17,931
and the Cold War.

1724
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,901
Our nation was unified
in its effort to end those wars.

1725
01:27:21,970 --> 01:27:25,605
That kind of resolve and unity
of purpose is needed today

1726
01:27:25,607 --> 01:27:28,341
as we address the resulting
environmental legacy.

1727
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:30,745
We remain committed
to completing cleanup

1728
01:27:30,812 --> 01:27:34,881
so that our host communities
can envision a vibrant future.

1729
01:27:34,950 --> 01:27:37,018
We can continue
to live in the past,

1730
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:39,753
or we can choose
to understand the past,

1731
01:27:39,821 --> 01:27:42,089
make course corrections,
and move forward

1732
01:27:42,157 --> 01:27:44,091
with collaborative solutions.

1733
01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:45,693
It's time to choose the latter.

1734
01:27:45,761 --> 01:27:48,295
You know, I've been
on this committee a long time.

1735
01:27:48,363 --> 01:27:50,831
We've seen DOE make
these promises before

1736
01:27:50,833 --> 01:27:52,832
with regards
to clean up operations.

1737
01:27:52,901 --> 01:27:54,635
What exactly does it mean

1738
01:27:54,703 --> 01:27:57,771
that DOE's
Environmental Management Office

1739
01:27:57,839 --> 01:28:01,309
does not follow
ED management practice.

1740
01:28:01,376 --> 01:28:04,577
Anybody that's been on
this job site should be fired.

1741
01:28:04,646 --> 01:28:05,979
They're not doing
their job right.

1742
01:28:06,048 --> 01:28:08,315
Where does Hanford sit?
It sits on the Columbia River.

1743
01:28:08,317 --> 01:28:09,983
Where does Savannah River
site sit?

1744
01:28:10,052 --> 01:28:11,518
It sits on the Savannah River.

1745
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:14,988
These are areas that are
environmentally sensitive.

1746
01:28:15,057 --> 01:28:17,123
Look, I'm not a nuclear
engineer,

1747
01:28:17,192 --> 01:28:19,192
but I'm a mom and a citizen,

1748
01:28:19,261 --> 01:28:22,395
and I can tell you
that leaving it out there longer

1749
01:28:22,464 --> 01:28:27,267
waiting for some type
of accident is not making

1750
01:28:27,269 --> 01:28:29,335
our constituents
across this country safer.

1751
01:28:29,405 --> 01:28:31,339
We need to do better
in the program

1752
01:28:31,406 --> 01:28:35,742
and project management,
and I think we can do better.

1753
01:28:35,811 --> 01:28:40,147
I do not believe government
has done enough to try

1754
01:28:40,215 --> 01:28:43,884
and build that bridge of trust.

1755
01:28:43,952 --> 01:28:46,553
My name is Anne White
and my position

1756
01:28:46,622 --> 01:28:48,621
was assistant secretary
of Energy

1757
01:28:48,690 --> 01:28:50,558
for Environmental Management

1758
01:28:50,625 --> 01:28:53,293
referred to as EM1.

1759
01:28:53,361 --> 01:29:01,901
¶¶

1760
01:29:01,970 --> 01:29:04,070
Obviously, when you've
got portions of the public

1761
01:29:04,072 --> 01:29:07,107
all over the country who are
unhappy with what you're doing,

1762
01:29:07,175 --> 01:29:09,109
you're probably not
doing enough,

1763
01:29:09,177 --> 01:29:12,645
especially for a site
like Santa Susana, small site.

1764
01:29:12,714 --> 01:29:18,251
It doesn't even usually come to
the radar of an EM1.

1765
01:29:18,253 --> 01:29:19,652
It's tough.

1766
01:29:19,721 --> 01:29:22,723
Those kind of big bureaucracies
are very challenging.

1767
01:29:22,791 --> 01:29:27,261
It kind of just felt
sometimes like a culture of...

1768
01:29:27,329 --> 01:29:28,596
...molasses.

1769
01:29:28,663 --> 01:29:31,197
Since 2011,
EM has spent over 45 billion

1770
01:29:31,266 --> 01:29:33,466
to try to address
the cleanup responsibilities.

1771
01:29:33,535 --> 01:29:36,269
And yet, we seem no closer
to cleaning up these sites

1772
01:29:36,271 --> 01:29:38,338
or reducing the department's
environmental liabilities.

1773
01:29:38,407 --> 01:29:42,409
EM cleanup right now
is the third biggest liability

1774
01:29:42,411 --> 01:29:44,010
to the US taxpayers.

1775
01:29:44,012 --> 01:29:47,413
We throw $7 billion
a year into that pot,

1776
01:29:47,483 --> 01:29:49,349
and the liabilities
don't go down.

1777
01:29:49,417 --> 01:29:52,086
Did the taxpayer get good value
for the $6 billion EM

1778
01:29:52,154 --> 01:29:55,088
roughly spent last
fiscal year on nuclear waste?

1779
01:29:55,157 --> 01:29:59,759
I believe that the taxpayer
got good value for their money.

1780
01:29:59,828 --> 01:30:01,295
-Okay.
-We can do better, though.

1781
01:30:01,363 --> 01:30:05,098
So many of these sites
are in places

1782
01:30:05,167 --> 01:30:08,969
where they are the only game
in town in terms of employment.

1783
01:30:08,971 --> 01:30:12,907
If the cleanup gets completed,
the jobs go away.

1784
01:30:12,974 --> 01:30:17,243
And so to some degree,
EM become a jobs program.

1785
01:30:17,245 --> 01:30:20,180
Cleanup of these sites
is critically important.

1786
01:30:20,182 --> 01:30:23,650
We need to have it happen
and we can't be sitting here

1787
01:30:23,718 --> 01:30:26,654
again in five, 10 or 20 years
hoping that it will.

1788
01:30:26,721 --> 01:30:28,389
The actions EM needs to take

1789
01:30:28,457 --> 01:30:30,457
involve significant
cultural change

1790
01:30:30,459 --> 01:30:33,861
at DOE headquarters,
the sites, and the contractors.

1791
01:30:33,929 --> 01:30:37,730
When it involves kids and moms
and all of these things,

1792
01:30:37,799 --> 01:30:43,337
maybe they've been heard,
but not listened to.

1793
01:30:43,405 --> 01:30:45,104
And there's there's
a difference,

1794
01:30:45,173 --> 01:30:48,943
I suppose,
there's a big difference.

1795
01:30:49,010 --> 01:30:51,144
And at Santa Susana right now,

1796
01:30:51,146 --> 01:30:55,015
honestly, the conversation
well could be so poisoned

1797
01:30:55,017 --> 01:30:57,951
that there -- there is
no reverse gear

1798
01:30:57,953 --> 01:30:59,819
in terms
of building that trust.

1799
01:30:59,888 --> 01:31:02,156
You just may never come
to common ground.

1800
01:31:02,224 --> 01:31:04,891
And that's a pity,

1801
01:31:04,893 --> 01:31:08,762
but that's maybe the nature of
the beast there. Unfortunately.

1802
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:20,307
I'm sure I didn't have
enough energy for it, I think.
[ Knock on door ]

1803
01:31:20,375 --> 01:31:22,842
I don't think
we did it last year.

1804
01:31:22,911 --> 01:31:24,310
Although, I don't know
if daddy will want me

1805
01:31:24,312 --> 01:31:25,578
to do it this year.

1806
01:31:25,647 --> 01:31:28,515
Child: Yeah...
[ speaks indistinctly ]

Poster or something instead.

1808
01:31:32,254 --> 01:31:33,453
You need to push down
your cuticle

1809
01:31:33,455 --> 01:31:35,189
and I'll come back
to that one.

1810
01:31:39,461 --> 01:31:41,594
-It's pretty.
-It is pretty.

1811
01:31:41,663 --> 01:31:43,263
Like how glittery it is.

1812
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:48,469
¶¶

1813
01:31:48,537 --> 01:31:49,804
I feel -- I feel more hopeful,

1814
01:31:49,871 --> 01:31:52,472
even though right
now things are looking

1815
01:31:52,541 --> 01:31:56,676
pretty glum again
for the cleanup right now.

1816
01:31:56,678 --> 01:32:00,280
I'm more at peace
with the thought

1817
01:32:00,282 --> 01:32:03,950
that this could be
the rest of my life.

1818
01:32:04,019 --> 01:32:07,754
Before that, that thought
was just too frightening.

1819
01:32:07,756 --> 01:32:10,423
¶¶

1820
01:32:10,425 --> 01:32:12,692
I feel like whether or not
it's the Santa Susana Field Lab

1821
01:32:12,761 --> 01:32:15,561
or maybe helping other sites.

1822
01:32:15,631 --> 01:32:17,897
If this were to be
the rest of my life,

1823
01:32:17,899 --> 01:32:22,235
I would -- I wouldn't fight it.

1824
01:32:22,304 --> 01:32:25,405
I had my own plans for my life,
I wanted to --

1825
01:32:25,474 --> 01:32:27,173
I wanted to
illustrate kids' books

1826
01:32:27,242 --> 01:32:29,143
and I wanted to be an author
and I wanted to garden

1827
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:33,646
and, you know, I had
a really simple life planned out

1828
01:32:33,715 --> 01:32:35,449
and it sounded just fantastic.

1829
01:32:35,517 --> 01:32:39,252
And the thought of not
getting to have time

1830
01:32:39,321 --> 01:32:43,657
to excel at any of those things
was really hard.

1831
01:32:43,659 --> 01:32:45,191
As I was praying about it,
I felt like God said,

1832
01:32:45,260 --> 01:32:47,061
I'm allowed to have a hobby.

1833
01:32:47,128 --> 01:32:50,430
¶¶

1834
01:32:50,432 --> 01:32:52,632
I was like, all right,
I can take my dreams

1835
01:32:52,701 --> 01:32:54,834
and let them be a hobby

1836
01:32:54,903 --> 01:32:59,740
and doing this is more important
than anything I had planned.

1837
01:32:59,808 --> 01:33:01,207
I definitely feel like this

1838
01:33:01,209 --> 01:33:04,545
is where I'm supposed to be
in my life right now.

1839
01:33:04,613 --> 01:33:08,281
¶¶

1840
01:33:08,350 --> 01:33:10,951
It took Gracie a lot of -- a lot
of hard work and time

1841
01:33:11,019 --> 01:33:13,687
to really kind of be
a regular kid again.

1842
01:33:13,689 --> 01:33:16,089
¶¶

1843
01:33:16,091 --> 01:33:19,225
She's not the kind of kid
to just lay down and take it.

1844
01:33:19,294 --> 01:33:22,629
She's really strong.

1845
01:33:22,697 --> 01:33:24,898
But the health effects

1846
01:33:24,966 --> 01:33:28,601
will follow her
all the rest of her life.

1847
01:33:28,670 --> 01:33:30,637
I have had
some people accuse me

1848
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:34,540
of using Grace's story.

1849
01:33:34,609 --> 01:33:38,678
To some degree,
that's really true.

1850
01:33:38,747 --> 01:33:40,580
If I could have brought
people's hearts along

1851
01:33:40,649 --> 01:33:45,051
without having to show
Gracie's story, I wouldn't have.

1852
01:33:45,053 --> 01:33:46,720
But if it helps other families

1853
01:33:46,788 --> 01:33:49,523
not have to go
through the same thing,

1854
01:33:49,591 --> 01:33:52,593
you know,
and then I-I don't regret it.

1855
01:33:52,661 --> 01:33:53,928
I don't think Grace
would regret it.

1856
01:33:53,995 --> 01:33:56,463
I think she understands that,

1857
01:33:56,531 --> 01:33:59,065
you know, before we're willing
to do anything to protect other

1858
01:33:59,134 --> 01:34:01,067
kids from what
she's gone through.

1859

1860
01:34:39,307 --> 01:34:41,308
Fixing her name and like...

1861
01:34:44,245 --> 01:34:49,116
Her birthday and stuff,
it's just so final.

1864
01:35:14,609 --> 01:35:17,009
The Santa Susana Field Lab

1865
01:35:17,078 --> 01:35:20,948
is I wouldn't say it's always
in the front of my mind,

1866
01:35:21,015 --> 01:35:25,618
but it is consistently
in the back of my mind.

1867
01:35:25,687 --> 01:35:28,855
In the back of my mind,
when I give my kids water

1868
01:35:28,924 --> 01:35:31,958
or give them a bath,
in the back of my mind

1869
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:34,028
when I see a new kid
diagnosed,

1870
01:35:34,095 --> 01:35:35,195
in the back of my mind,

1871
01:35:35,263 --> 01:35:39,767
when I see another kid
who's passed away.

1872
01:35:39,834 --> 01:35:44,504
It's a hard one, I know I can't
put all of my energy there.

1873
01:35:44,572 --> 01:35:47,707
I'm still working my way back
to being fully present

1874
01:35:47,775 --> 01:35:52,111
with everybody,
and my kids need their mom.

1875
01:35:52,180 --> 01:35:54,781
¶¶

1876
01:35:54,783 --> 01:35:57,717
I've been slowly putting pieces
back together

1877
01:35:57,786 --> 01:36:00,587
and I'm not as lost.

1878
01:36:00,655 --> 01:36:02,922
I'm still lost,
but not as lost

1879
01:36:02,924 --> 01:36:07,393
if that makes sense.

1880
01:36:07,462 --> 01:36:11,265
For me, I know I can
never give up trying to fight.

1881
01:36:11,332 --> 01:36:14,000
But I also know that I...

1882
01:36:14,002 --> 01:36:17,670
I have to use this brain
sparingly because it's focused

1883
01:36:17,739 --> 01:36:19,807
on so many different things
right now.

1884
01:36:19,874 --> 01:36:22,141
I'm trying to heal,
I'm trying to process,

1885
01:36:22,210 --> 01:36:25,278
trying to grieve,
trying to be a mom.

1886
01:36:25,347 --> 01:36:27,514
¶¶

1887
01:36:27,582 --> 01:36:28,849
But it's always there.

1888
01:36:28,916 --> 01:36:30,750
It's always this
lingering question in my mind,

1889
01:36:30,818 --> 01:36:34,487
it's always this idea
that is there

1890
01:36:34,556 --> 01:36:37,357
and it can't be quieted until

1891
01:36:37,359 --> 01:36:39,158
it's cleaned up, I think.

1892
01:36:39,227 --> 01:36:42,429
¶¶

1893
01:36:51,506 --> 01:36:55,175
I hope that there's an end
to this story.

1894
01:36:55,243 --> 01:36:58,077
Given what's happening
in our country,

1895
01:36:58,079 --> 01:37:03,217
I worry about all of our efforts
to protect public health.

1896
01:37:03,284 --> 01:37:06,853
I worry that focusing on
Santa Susana

1897
01:37:06,921 --> 01:37:09,322
will seem like a luxury,

1898
01:37:09,390 --> 01:37:11,558
that it will seem
like days have passed

1899
01:37:11,626 --> 01:37:14,727
when you actually could fight
a fight and you might just win

1900
01:37:14,729 --> 01:37:16,829
and you could get
a cleanup agreement

1901
01:37:16,898 --> 01:37:18,664
and you could do
community organizing

1902
01:37:18,733 --> 01:37:21,200
and you could speak freely.

1903
01:37:21,269 --> 01:37:25,938
We are in a world of distraction
and of self-centeredness,

1904
01:37:26,007 --> 01:37:28,875
but we don't sense
any connection to others

1905
01:37:28,877 --> 01:37:30,209
and particularly to

1906
01:37:30,278 --> 01:37:33,080
those who suffer and if we don't
connect to the damage

1907
01:37:33,147 --> 01:37:35,147
we do to the planet,

1908
01:37:35,216 --> 01:37:37,617
the everyday people
who are affected by

1909
01:37:37,685 --> 01:37:40,953
polluters are just
being walked all over.

1910
01:37:41,022 --> 01:37:45,225
The damage that is done
over the last century,

1911
01:37:45,293 --> 01:37:47,093
we simply have to keep fighting.

1912
01:37:47,162 --> 01:37:49,695
I've been a reporter
for 38 years.

1913
01:37:49,764 --> 01:37:52,231
I've seen just about everything.

1914
01:37:52,233 --> 01:37:56,702
I'm still surprised that
there were government officials

1915
01:37:56,771 --> 01:37:58,504
who looked me in the eye
and said,

1916
01:37:58,506 --> 01:38:00,239
"Santa Susana's not a problem."

1917
01:38:00,241 --> 01:38:03,309
Even when there were
so many government documents

1918
01:38:03,311 --> 01:38:04,611
that said otherwise.

1919
01:38:04,679 --> 01:38:09,315
I mean, I think the public
is not so easily fooled.

1920
01:38:09,317 --> 01:38:12,853
They know there's
something here.

1921
01:38:12,921 --> 01:38:16,455
The truth always comes out
in the end.

1922
01:38:16,524 --> 01:38:19,459
I think it takes
an enormous amount of courage.

1923
01:38:19,461 --> 01:38:20,993
And a hell of a lot of work

1924
01:38:21,062 --> 01:38:24,731
to see that there is
accountability

1925
01:38:24,799 --> 01:38:27,467
and that something is done.

1926
01:38:27,469 --> 01:38:28,836
It's up to the mothers.

1927
01:38:28,903 --> 01:38:32,805
And others who have the courage,
have the time to make damn sure

1928
01:38:32,807 --> 01:38:35,541
that something happens
if there's change.

1929
01:38:35,610 --> 01:38:37,777
It may be the only way.

1930
01:38:37,846 --> 01:38:39,045
Who's going to be
the next child,

1931
01:38:39,113 --> 01:38:40,947
who's going to be the next
person in your community.

1932
01:38:40,949 --> 01:38:43,883
You don't ever give up
on something like this

1933
01:38:43,951 --> 01:38:46,152
because it's the right thing
to do.

1934
01:38:46,154 --> 01:38:49,556
Where the people lead,
the leaders will follow.

1935
01:38:49,624 --> 01:38:52,626
Woman: Being in a low right now
doesn't feel like defeat,

1936
01:38:52,694 --> 01:38:56,463
it just feels like
part of the journey.

1937
01:38:56,531 --> 01:38:57,930
And the thing
that's heartbreaking

1938
01:38:57,932 --> 01:39:02,236
is that it's just
going to continue.

1939
01:39:02,303 --> 01:39:03,704
But it's the kids
who have to suffer,

1940
01:39:03,771 --> 01:39:06,673
and it's the parents
who have to bury them

1941
01:39:06,741 --> 01:39:09,709
that have to bear that
for the rest of our lives.

1942
01:39:09,777 --> 01:39:13,647
¶¶

1943
01:39:16,050 --> 01:39:20,453
Oh, I'm not going to stop
so we'll just have to

1944
01:39:20,455 --> 01:39:23,590
find out who has more
endurance me or them, maybe.

1945
01:39:23,658 --> 01:39:27,260
