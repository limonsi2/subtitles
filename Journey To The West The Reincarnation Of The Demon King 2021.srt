3
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:16,375
When the primal chaos

4
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:18,167
was first differentiated,

5
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:20,250
the light and clear qi

6
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:22,042
ascended to be the sky

7
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:24,375
while the heavy and turbid qi

8
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:27,042
- descended to be the earth...
- Stop.

9
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:28,125
I don't get it.

10
00:01:30,917 --> 00:01:32,083
That is,

11
00:01:32,167 --> 00:01:34,667
when heaven and earth
were first separated,

12
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,833
the first demon was born.

13
00:01:38,542 --> 00:01:39,417
His name was

14
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,917
primordium.

15
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:42,500
He was

16
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:44,625
the ancestor of myriad demons.

17
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:47,125
Primordium was almighty

18
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:49,292
as the progenitor of demons.

19
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,042
He sought to rule the three realms.

20
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:53,000
The bodhisattvas could not subdue him.

21
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:55,125
All the heavenly generals

22
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:56,333
and daluo golden immortals

23
00:01:56,417 --> 00:01:59,500
were utterly defeated by him.

24
00:02:02,917 --> 00:02:04,292
Eventually,

25
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,833
a disciple of Buddha

26
00:02:07,917 --> 00:02:10,458
exerted all his qi energy

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,083
to seal primordium

28
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:17,167
once and for all

29
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,542
into the darkest
and coldest reaches of the earth.

30
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:24,667
Well done.

31
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:25,708
The origin of demons

32
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:29,542
is that all?

33
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:30,625
That's all.

34
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:33,000
It's just another cooked-up tale.

35
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:35,043
I could say I am
the father of the great ancestor!

36
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:36,792
Bajie,

37
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,475
don't curse ancestors, not even a demon.

38
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:40,583
Then tell me.

39
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:42,542
What is so great about this primordium?

40
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:44,458
According to this book,

41
00:02:44,542 --> 00:02:46,708
wherever primordium set foot,

42
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:48,042
no life remained.

43
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:50,208
He could even change any living thing

44
00:02:50,292 --> 00:02:51,917
into a demon.

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,500
Do you actually believe that?

46
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:54,417
The book even says

47
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,292
great sage equaling heaven
is all-powerful.

48
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,167
Yet, the monkey is now one of us

49
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,542
on a pilgrimage for scriptures.

50
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:02,833
That's my brochure!

51
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:04,208
My brother, you're never sure.

52
00:03:04,292 --> 00:03:05,958
Against myriad worldly thoughts,

53
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,375
stick with our heart chakra.

54
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,083
If we don't understand fully,

55
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:13,125
resort to zen quotes.

56
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:15,000
With Buddha in mind,

57
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,250
we will see all sentient beings.

58
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:21,958
My dearest wukong,

59
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,750
when are you coming back?

60
00:03:34,542 --> 00:03:36,458
What is with this melancholy, master?

61
00:03:36,542 --> 00:03:38,208
Why are you crying?

62
00:03:38,292 --> 00:03:39,417
Seeing you heartbroken,

63
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,667
I also feel sad.

64
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,583
Master, I'm so pathetic.

65
00:03:49,667 --> 00:03:51,167
My tummy rumbled again.

66
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:54,083
Bajie, it was me.

67
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm starving.

68
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,667
It's that shitty monkey's fault.

69
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,750
Where did he go?

70
00:03:59,792 --> 00:04:01,542
Master is so hungry that he cried!

71
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,792
I shed a tear

72
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,667
for this world.

73
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,708
What the...

74
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,500
Bajie,

75
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,708
monks should not ingratiate themselves

76
00:04:13,792 --> 00:04:15,292
or speak vulgarly.

77
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,625
No, I mean that whatever the tear is for,

78
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:20,083
I will wipe it.

79
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,792
Cool as usual.

80
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:10,583
This shitty monkey

81
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:11,833
never does anything good.

82
00:05:11,917 --> 00:05:13,167
Did you make such a fuss

83
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,667
only to bring back a bowl of water?

84
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:18,833
Shut it.

85
00:05:18,917 --> 00:05:20,792
My entrance must always be cool.

86
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,000
Master!

87
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:27,000
Master, this monkey always
causes trouble like a demon

88
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:28,417
because you spoil him.

89
00:05:28,917 --> 00:05:29,917
Bajie,

90
00:05:30,542 --> 00:05:32,262
all sentient beings dwell
in the ten worlds,

91
00:05:32,292 --> 00:05:33,892
which include the six realms of rebirth.

92
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,397
There are tens of millions of demons.

93
00:05:35,917 --> 00:05:37,208
However,

94
00:05:37,292 --> 00:05:38,958
what exactly is a demon?

95
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,250
The book says

96
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,792
that all things endowed
have their own soul.

97
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:12,500
Yet,

98
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,708
we demons have never had a proper soul.

99
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,833
Master,

100
00:06:21,917 --> 00:06:23,417
once we have acquired the scriptures,

101
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,083
will we have a soul?

102
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:26,208
Wujing,

103
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,583
when you think it is there,

104
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:30,583
it will be there.

105
00:06:36,292 --> 00:06:37,292
A soul?

106
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,917
It's not worth a shit.

107
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:10,833
Wuzhuang temple

108
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,917
My goodness!

109
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,208
How sweet and dewy

110
00:07:20,292 --> 00:07:21,625
these patronesses are!

111
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:22,792
Look!

112
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,308
Are you from the great tang in the east?

113
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,125
The ones on a pilgrimage to the west?

114
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,042
They are actually males.

115
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,458
Astute observation, children.

116
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,208
Exactly.

117
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,708
My Buddhist name is xuanzang.

118
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,250
Come with us.

119
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,625
This must be a well-to-do family.

120
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:00,417
Sumptuous.

121
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,333
Children, who is your master?

122
00:08:25,417 --> 00:08:27,292
Our master's taoist name is zhenyuanzi.

123
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,500
The primeval lord of heaven
invited him to a banquet.

124
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:31,583
So it's great immortal zhenyuan.

125
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:33,250
Remarkable.

126
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,792
Try our vegetarian meal later.

127
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,292
Many immortals make
a trip here just to burn it off us.

128
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:41,167
Marvelous.

129
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,708
I can already tell you are hungry.

130
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:45,667
We are.

131
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:47,375
Just wait, then.

132
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,750
Hey, monkey! No touching!

133
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,375
You can't afford to break anything.

134
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:52,542
Watch your mouth.

135
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,042
You can't afford to irritate me.

136
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:56,625
You...

137
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:58,292
Let's go. Just ignore him.

138
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:10,250
Heavenly lake

139
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,417
So you don't worship the three pure ones?

140
00:09:23,917 --> 00:09:25,083
How arrogant!

141
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,750
Wukong,

142
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,583
you are in my way.

143
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:29,958
Troublesome.

144
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:34,625
Look at how poor he is.

145
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,934
I don't know why master would
pluck our precious treasure

146
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:37,958
for him to eat.

147
00:09:38,042 --> 00:09:39,917
Exactly. What a waste!

148
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:42,167
Pure wind, how about this?

149
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,292
Let's eat it.

150
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,208
What if master finds out?

151
00:09:46,792 --> 00:09:47,875
Just give them enough food

152
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,250
and send them away before master returns.

153
00:09:51,542 --> 00:09:52,583
Treasure?

154
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,167
Where has the monkey gone again?

155
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,083
You almost scared me to death.

156
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:07,333
Why are you not dead yet?

157
00:10:07,417 --> 00:10:08,417
Beat it.

158
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:10,417
Guess what?

159
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,083
They have a treasure in this temple

160
00:10:12,167 --> 00:10:14,000
- that is edible.
- Tell me now.

161
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:18,375
I just love to talk slowly.

162
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:21,083
Are you telling or not?

163
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:22,375
Okay, I will.

164
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:24,583
The kids said

165
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:26,875
that the treasure is so good,

166
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,292
they must keep it from us.

167
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,415
They will keep it from me?

168
00:10:29,917 --> 00:10:31,333
Then I will have to eat it.

169
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:32,708
See?

170
00:10:32,792 --> 00:10:34,500
That's why master dotes on you.

171
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,292
You are the real deal. A tough guy!

172
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:58,958
Get up here.

173
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,833
I nearly had my guts squeezed out!

174
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:11,958
Impressive.

175
00:11:12,042 --> 00:11:14,542
What a big pit!

176
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,792
It really is a treasure.

177
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,250
Let's pick some and have a taste.

178
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,458
Look, wukong.

179
00:12:19,542 --> 00:12:20,417
Lord monkey.

180
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,792
Mr. Great sage.

181
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:23,667
Make it quick!

182
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,667
Hurry, will you?

183
00:12:27,042 --> 00:12:28,542
How impatient.

184
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:43,042
Down you come!

185
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:15,042
I can sense both heavenly
and demonic energy.

186
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,458
That's weird.

187
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,958
Come on out!

188
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:39,875
My greetings, great sage.

189
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:42,250
- I am the local god of long...
- 4-009, my ass.

190
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,333
You stole my treasure.

191
00:13:43,417 --> 00:13:45,500
Now, you want to tell me your name?

192
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,042
You're mistaken!

193
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,375
I would never dare to mess with you.

194
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,042
- I am just a small...
- Bigger.

195
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,333
- Stop.
- A small and humble spirit.

196
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:57,792
If you don't hand it over,

197
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,208
I will turn your earth.

198
00:13:59,292 --> 00:14:01,042
Out with it. Where is it hidden?

199
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:03,333
This treasure

200
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,875
is known as grass-returning cinnabar

201
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,292
or manfruit.

202
00:14:08,792 --> 00:14:10,792
It takes at least 10,000 years

203
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:13,417
to grow from blossom to ripened fruit.

204
00:14:13,917 --> 00:14:14,958
Only 30 fruits are formed

205
00:14:15,042 --> 00:14:16,750
in one harvest.

206
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,375
If you eat one,

207
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,667
you would live

208
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,792
for 47,000 years.

209
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,315
What is the use in living that long?

210
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:25,625
I only care if it is tasty.

211
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:26,958
Go on.

212
00:14:27,042 --> 00:14:28,458
Hold on.

213
00:14:28,542 --> 00:14:29,667
The manfruits

214
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,583
fear only the five elements.

215
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:33,042
If they meet metal, they fall.

216
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,333
If they meet wood, they rot.

217
00:14:34,417 --> 00:14:35,833
If they meet water, they dissolve.

218
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,417
If they meet fire, they burn.

219
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,833
And if they meet the earth, they sink.

220
00:14:46,542 --> 00:14:47,542
Great sage!

221
00:14:48,292 --> 00:14:50,958
It really is an amazing treasure.

222
00:14:51,042 --> 00:14:52,667
So it went into the earth.

223
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,625
Great sage, although the fruit is good,

224
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:55,458
this tree...

225
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,250
Okay, stop blabbering. Leave.

226
00:14:57,292 --> 00:14:59,375
Great sage, don't touch this tree!

227
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:28,208
Let's do it here.

228
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:30,668
We should wait
for them to leave before eating it.

229
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,417
I still feel nervous.

230
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:33,833
What are you waiting for?

231
00:15:33,917 --> 00:15:35,917
Once it is picked, the fruit won't keep.

232
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:51,333
Awesome.

233
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,707
Wukong, pretty please.

234
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,833
Can I get a bite?

235
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,582
I was so excited

236
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,166
that I finished it in one gulp.

237
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:06,000
I didn't even taste its flavor.

238
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:08,542
Oh no!

239
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:12,625
Six, seven, eight, nine.

240
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,958
Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen!

241
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:20,458
Twenty-one!

242
00:16:20,542 --> 00:16:21,583
Twenty-two!

243
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:22,500
Twenty-three!

244
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:23,583
Twenty-four!

245
00:16:25,292 --> 00:16:26,750
- Four short!
- Four short!

246
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:27,958
Get one yourself.

247
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:30,292
Venerable monkey!

248
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:31,375
Could you get

249
00:16:31,417 --> 00:16:33,625
one last fruit for me?

250
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:34,542
I'll kick your ass

251
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,125
if you don't shut up.

252
00:16:37,292 --> 00:16:38,292
You are shameless!

253
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:39,375
Stinking monster!

254
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,750
You ate our treasured fruit!

255
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,375
I didn't.

256
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:44,958
You did.

257
00:16:45,042 --> 00:16:45,833
I didn't.

258
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,333
- You did!
- You did!

259
00:16:47,417 --> 00:16:48,333
I didn't.

260
00:16:48,417 --> 00:16:49,458
We did.

261
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:51,333
So what?

262
00:16:51,417 --> 00:16:52,625
You hairy-faced monster!

263
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:53,917
You're despicable!

264
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:56,333
Wukong,

265
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,707
what happened?

266
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,917
Monk, don't pretend to be ignorant!

267
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,666
I plucked the manfruits.

268
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:05,166
I also ate them.

269
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:06,457
My master had no idea.

270
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:07,874
It's up to you

271
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,917
to punch me or punish me.

272
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,958
Gods above, lend me your power.

273
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,000
Wukong, don't fight back.

274
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,041
Children, don't drive him mad.

275
00:17:33,042 --> 00:17:34,124
You poor monk.

276
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,666
How could you encourage your disciples

277
00:17:35,667 --> 00:17:36,375
to steal?

278
00:17:36,376 --> 00:17:37,582
Four are missing.

279
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,582
It was obviously

280
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,000
one for each of you!

281
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:43,999
I admit to eating it,

282
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,166
but not to the amount you said.

283
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:47,249
We only ate three!

284
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,749
-Fouh -three!

285
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,875
Four!

286
00:17:51,042 --> 00:17:53,249
It was indeed three.

287
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,332
- It was four!
- It was four!

288
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,457
- Three.
- Three.

289
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:56,208
Three!

290
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:59,207
Wait. What did you eat behind my back?

291
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,333
-Fouh -fouh

292
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:04,207
wukong, what did you eat?

293
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,082
Stop pretending, monk.

294
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,833
Your innocent look really makes me sick.

295
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,750
It has nothing to do with him.

296
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,542
I'll make it up to you.

297
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:15,707
Until our master returns,

298
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,125
you aren't going anywhere!

299
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:18,791
Get lost.

300
00:18:18,792 --> 00:18:20,624
Wukong, take a deep breath.

301
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,207
Hold your horses.

302
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:23,874
Who do you think he is?

303
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:26,457
A bastard monkey with no parents.

304
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,791
What can he do?

305
00:18:27,792 --> 00:18:29,207
Who did you calla bastard?

306
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,916
Monkey, they cursed you.

307
00:18:30,917 --> 00:18:32,166
Yes, I just cursed you.

308
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:33,499
You are merely a demon

309
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,458
that does nothing but evil.

310
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,708
Then I'll show you what evil is!

311
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,000
Oi of the eight classes of being!

312
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:57,208
Wukong!

313
00:19:00,292 --> 00:19:01,500
Wukong!

314
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:04,208
You two bit off more than you can chew!

315
00:19:17,459 --> 00:19:19,000
Return to wuzhuang temple at once!

316
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:27,375
Evil monkey,

317
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:29,124
if you dare to touch a single leaf,

318
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,208
great immortal zhenyuan won't let you off!

319
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,875
I will kick the shit out of him as well!

320
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,041
Pure wind, what do we do?

321
00:19:50,042 --> 00:19:51,542
Go all out with this evil monkey!

322
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,999
Great.

323
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,374
Then I will send you both

324
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,000
to hell!

325
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,625
Wukong!

326
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:55,583
This is a disaster!

327
00:20:55,584 --> 00:20:57,333
We are toast.

328
00:20:57,667 --> 00:20:59,750
Pure wind! Bright moon!

329
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,416
Master, tang sanzang
allowed his evil disciples

330
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:04,042
to steal our treasured fruits!

331
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:05,832
The evil monkey, sun wukong,

332
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:08,417
even destroyed the magic tree!

333
00:21:15,417 --> 00:21:17,083
All disciples,

334
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,375
deploy the demon-quelling array!

335
00:21:37,917 --> 00:21:39,582
Without my command,

336
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:42,166
no one is to leave his position!

337
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:43,583
- Yes, master!
- Yes, master!

338
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,749
Forgive me, great immortal zhenyuan.

339
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,625
It is my failure in disciplining them.

340
00:21:52,292 --> 00:21:54,749
I am willing to be punished.

341
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,249
I have treated you with courtesy,

342
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,167
yet you indulged your pupil's wicked ways.

343
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,082
I ate the manfruit.

344
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:01,666
I kicked down the tree.

345
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:03,207
Come at me.

346
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:04,625
Cheeky ape!

347
00:22:17,792 --> 00:22:19,292
Your target is the monkey.

348
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:20,833
Why did you hit me?

349
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:28,167
Old jerk, don't run!

350
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:33,042
Great immortal,

351
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:35,125
please calm down!

352
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:02,792
Master, the array is broken!

353
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:09,875
Golden cicada,

354
00:23:10,542 --> 00:23:12,792
how have you been?

355
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:20,958
Wukong!

356
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:26,833
There is no time.

357
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:29,333
Draw in!

358
00:24:02,792 --> 00:24:04,375
Stupid demons!

359
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:44,667
Pure wind, bright moon, take your orders.

360
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,870
- Yes, master.
- Yes, master.

361
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:47,333
Report to the Jade emperor at once.

362
00:24:47,417 --> 00:24:48,708
This monkey, sun wukong,

363
00:24:48,792 --> 00:24:50,375
took down the magic tree

364
00:24:50,458 --> 00:24:52,208
and released primordium, the primal demon!

365
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:55,208
- Yes, master!
- Yes, master!

366
00:24:55,292 --> 00:24:56,708
Primordium, the primal demon?

367
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,583
Is there really such a demon?

368
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:06,125
You lot have committed a heinous crime.

369
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:08,333
Await punishment from heaven.

370
00:25:08,583 --> 00:25:09,707
What is our crime?

371
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,542
This manfruit tree

372
00:25:11,792 --> 00:25:13,082
was created by the qi energy

373
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:14,957
of a disciple of Buddha.

374
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:17,457
Its roots impaled primordium's acupoints

375
00:25:17,458 --> 00:25:19,250
to keep him sealed in the ground.

376
00:25:19,917 --> 00:25:21,042
It is just a demon.

377
00:25:21,542 --> 00:25:24,458
Why is the patriarch of
the earth's immortals so scared?

378
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:26,500
I'm going to save my master.

379
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:28,624
While I'm at it, I'll get the demon too.

380
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:30,332
Easier said than done.

381
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:31,916
In three days,

382
00:25:31,917 --> 00:25:33,958
primordium's original body
will be restored.

383
00:25:34,417 --> 00:25:36,707
When he devours your master

384
00:25:36,708 --> 00:25:39,125
and gains golden cicada's
ten lifetimes of cultivation,

385
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:40,625
chaos

386
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:43,416
and fatal destruction

387
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:45,125
will beset the three realms.

388
00:25:45,667 --> 00:25:48,667
There is no demon that I cannot subdue!

389
00:25:49,583 --> 00:25:51,999
You overestimate yourself.

390
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,416
What if I can do it?

391
00:25:53,417 --> 00:25:54,749
What if you can't?

392
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,333
I'll be at your disposal!

393
00:25:56,625 --> 00:25:57,625
All right.

394
00:25:58,458 --> 00:26:00,582
If you fail to catch primordium,

395
00:26:00,583 --> 00:26:03,499
you will once again be imprisoned
beneath five elements mountain

396
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,958
and never taste freedom.

397
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:12,000
All right.

398
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,750
You have a deal.

399
00:26:14,417 --> 00:26:15,792
That's a deal.

400
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:23,667
Come on.

401
00:26:23,668 --> 00:26:24,874
Let's save master.

402
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:27,374
Monkey, that's the ancestor of all demons!

403
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:28,750
Shut up!

404
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:31,125
But...

405
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:12,125
Where did this wild demon come from?

406
00:28:12,292 --> 00:28:13,916
How dare he?

407
00:28:13,917 --> 00:28:16,042
He's big enough to feed us for a few days.

408
00:28:16,958 --> 00:28:18,333
What kind of demon is it?

409
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:19,999
Are you blind?

410
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,374
It's just a giant salamander.

411
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:23,624
Piss off! You're the blind one.

412
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:25,917
No giant salamander is this ugly.

413
00:28:35,417 --> 00:28:37,333
State your name and die.

414
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:41,917
Primordium.

415
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:48,916
I am king white brows of millennium peak.

416
00:28:48,917 --> 00:28:51,416
My minions and I
congratulate you on your revival,

417
00:28:51,417 --> 00:28:52,958
ancestor of demons!

418
00:28:53,375 --> 00:28:54,624
Primordium, the primal demon.

419
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:55,625
Yes.

420
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,917
Exactly!

421
00:28:57,958 --> 00:29:00,083
Congratulations on your revival, ancestor.

422
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:02,458
We have been waiting for a long time.

423
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:04,042
My revival.

424
00:29:04,792 --> 00:29:07,458
During those thousands of years in hell,

425
00:29:07,792 --> 00:29:09,041
your qi energy

426
00:29:09,042 --> 00:29:11,708
turned me into this form.

427
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,582
My body

428
00:29:13,583 --> 00:29:15,917
was devoured by the dark earth.

429
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:19,083
It was all because of you!

430
00:29:21,417 --> 00:29:23,291
Golden cicada,

431
00:29:23,292 --> 00:29:24,667
in three days,

432
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,625
I will

433
00:29:26,708 --> 00:29:29,125
once again rule over the three realms!

434
00:29:37,167 --> 00:29:39,250
- My goodness! Such power!
- My goodness! Such power!

435
00:29:43,875 --> 00:29:46,792
Before my original body is restored,

436
00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:48,708
take care of this monk.

437
00:29:48,792 --> 00:29:49,625
Don't worry.

438
00:29:49,708 --> 00:29:50,875
Leave him to us.

439
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,917
Wukong!

440
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,292
Help!

441
00:30:06,042 --> 00:30:08,000
Ancestor, this monk's head disciple

442
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:09,750
is not to be messed with.

443
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:11,250
He is the powerful sun wukong,

444
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:12,167
king of demons,

445
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,167
who wreaked havoc at the temple in heaven

446
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,500
500 years ago.

447
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:17,042
The king of demons?

448
00:30:19,292 --> 00:30:21,000
In the absence of a tiger,

449
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:23,083
even a monkey can take the throne.

450
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:25,500
Good point, ancestor.

451
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:28,042
Sun wukong is indeed a monkey!

452
00:30:36,083 --> 00:30:38,726
We're only telling Jade emperor
that the monkey released primordium.

453
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,875
Don't say too much.

454
00:30:39,958 --> 00:30:42,542
Pure wind, will we get in trouble too?

455
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:43,625
Don't you get it?

456
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:46,292
We need to lay the blame on that monkey.

457
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:48,333
I get it now.

458
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:09,708
Virupaksa,

459
00:31:09,792 --> 00:31:11,500
we have an urgent report for his majesty.

460
00:31:11,583 --> 00:31:12,875
Please let us pass.

461
00:31:14,167 --> 00:31:16,667
No hurry, children.

462
00:31:32,542 --> 00:31:33,667
Please wait

463
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:36,125
as I write the notification.

464
00:31:36,208 --> 00:31:37,083
Heavenly king,

465
00:31:37,167 --> 00:31:39,226
our master is
the patriarch of the earth's immortals.

466
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:41,292
No hurry, children.

467
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:43,208
Whoever he is,

468
00:31:43,292 --> 00:31:46,167
matters must be handled impartially.

469
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,042
Then go ahead. Be quick.

470
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:07,917
Wukong, we must find the primal demon

471
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,125
before his body is restored.

472
00:32:09,208 --> 00:32:10,375
Let's drop it.

473
00:32:10,458 --> 00:32:11,542
We have searched all night.

474
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:13,375
Even if we do find primordium,

475
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:15,042
master must be dead already.

476
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,667
Bajie, don't curse master.

477
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:29,417
It's master's ghost!

478
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,000
Don't come to me!

479
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,792
Master, please forgive bajie.

480
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:36,042
Master, I will keep my mouth shut.

481
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:37,583
Please go and be reincarnated.

482
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:39,917
I shouldn't have cursed you.

483
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:46,500
Where are you from, demon?

484
00:32:46,583 --> 00:32:48,583
Answer or I will bust your ass.

485
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:26,708
It's comfy.

486
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:34,042
What kind of demon are you?

487
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:35,750
I'm not a demon.

488
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:38,083
I'm qi energy.

489
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:39,542
Qi energy?

490
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:40,583
Yes!

491
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:43,332
I am qi energy.

492
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:45,916
I can catch primordium and seal him away.

493
00:33:45,917 --> 00:33:47,582
I heard you were looking for primordium,

494
00:33:47,583 --> 00:33:48,832
so I followed you.

495
00:33:48,833 --> 00:33:51,375
Are you the qi energy
that sealed primordium under the tree?

496
00:33:51,667 --> 00:33:54,458
Yes!

497
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:56,124
Do you know me?

498
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:58,292
Come here, little thing.

499
00:33:58,333 --> 00:33:59,666
You're not a demon.

500
00:33:59,667 --> 00:34:01,249
But we are.

501
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,500
Are you not afraid?

502
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,332
All sentient beings
dwell in the ten worlds,

503
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:07,291
which include the six realms of rebirth.

504
00:34:07,292 --> 00:34:08,999
There are tens of millions of demons.

505
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,083
Stop it.

506
00:34:11,792 --> 00:34:13,500
Qi energy, my ass.

507
00:34:13,583 --> 00:34:15,000
You're just a manfruit spirit.

508
00:34:23,083 --> 00:34:26,833
Primordium, where are you hiding?

509
00:34:36,167 --> 00:34:37,707
Gently!

510
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:39,291
Great sage!

511
00:34:39,292 --> 00:34:42,874
I just escaped from longevity mountain.

512
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:44,916
Why did you bring me back?

513
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:45,875
Why were you running?

514
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:47,916
You released primordium.

515
00:34:47,917 --> 00:34:49,166
If I don't run,

516
00:34:49,167 --> 00:34:50,832
I will be dead meat.

517
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:52,499
Tell me. Where is primordium hiding?

518
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,375
Great sage,

519
00:34:53,376 --> 00:34:55,666
this is the mountain deity's territory.

520
00:34:55,667 --> 00:34:57,207
He knows every move made

521
00:34:57,208 --> 00:34:58,417
within the territory.

522
00:34:58,583 --> 00:34:59,874
Mountain deity?

523
00:34:59,875 --> 00:35:01,375
Go and bring him to me.

524
00:35:02,708 --> 00:35:05,083
The mountain deity
dwells in five blessings peak.

525
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:07,457
He is an immortal with a temple.

526
00:35:07,458 --> 00:35:09,792
A humble spirit like me
can't make him do anything.

527
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,291
I'll go see him myself.

528
00:35:12,292 --> 00:35:13,582
Great sage,

529
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:16,457
primordium must be hiding
somewhere in the dark.

530
00:35:16,458 --> 00:35:17,707
A demon can't be too careful

531
00:35:17,708 --> 00:35:19,416
when restoring himself.

532
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,541
The qi energy that sealed primordium

533
00:35:21,542 --> 00:35:23,999
has taken a human form
after 10,000 years of cultivation.

534
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,667
If he were to help you...

535
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:31,292
You have become senile.

536
00:35:31,792 --> 00:35:33,916
How could that fruit spirit
seal primordium?

537
00:35:33,917 --> 00:35:35,166
Wukong, look.

538
00:35:35,167 --> 00:35:36,791
It is what the book says.

539
00:35:36,792 --> 00:35:38,582
"A disciple of Buddha

540
00:35:38,583 --> 00:35:40,457
had to exert all his qi energy

541
00:35:40,458 --> 00:35:42,833
to subdue primordium."

542
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:53,375
Are those three demons looking for me?

543
00:35:54,708 --> 00:35:56,417
Golden cicada,

544
00:35:56,958 --> 00:35:59,167
do you really think

545
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:01,292
that they can save you?

546
00:36:03,708 --> 00:36:05,875
I took them as disciples

547
00:36:05,958 --> 00:36:07,625
to unite them.

548
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:11,250
A hateful demon,

549
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:12,458
a greedy monster,

550
00:36:12,542 --> 00:36:14,583
and an ignorant devil.

551
00:36:14,667 --> 00:36:16,208
Unite them?

552
00:36:16,292 --> 00:36:17,375
Golden cicada,

553
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:19,667
you should stop dreaming.

554
00:36:21,625 --> 00:36:23,708
All sentient beings are equal,

555
00:36:23,792 --> 00:36:25,792
whether demon, monster, ghost,

556
00:36:25,875 --> 00:36:27,625
human, deity, immortal, or spirit.

557
00:36:27,708 --> 00:36:29,750
As long as we are

558
00:36:29,833 --> 00:36:31,500
of one mind and one soul,

559
00:36:31,583 --> 00:36:32,583
that will be enough.

560
00:36:33,083 --> 00:36:34,083
Demons

561
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:36,708
have no such thing!

562
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:44,458
Great master,

563
00:36:45,167 --> 00:36:47,417
you sacrificed your life

564
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,000
to save the world

565
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:51,125
and gave peace to future generations.

566
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,625
I am deeply impressed.

567
00:36:55,708 --> 00:36:56,708
Fish brains,

568
00:36:57,708 --> 00:37:00,583
take fruitie to five blessings peak.

569
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:04,708
Fruitie!

570
00:37:05,875 --> 00:37:06,875
Let's go!

571
00:37:12,542 --> 00:37:13,667
You're running?

572
00:37:18,583 --> 00:37:19,583
It smells good!

573
00:37:34,583 --> 00:37:35,875
Whose pig is that?

574
00:37:37,667 --> 00:37:38,833
Here you are!

575
00:37:38,917 --> 00:37:40,458
Get lost if you're not buying.

576
00:37:40,542 --> 00:37:41,542
Brat!

577
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:42,792
Leave. Move it!

578
00:37:42,875 --> 00:37:44,625
- Run!
- Wait for me!

579
00:37:44,708 --> 00:37:45,583
Come on!

580
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:46,667
Come.

581
00:37:48,208 --> 00:37:49,833
I love eating this!

582
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:52,833
- Demon!
- A demon!

583
00:37:54,542 --> 00:37:55,583
A demon!

584
00:37:55,667 --> 00:37:57,042
There is a demon!

585
00:38:03,042 --> 00:38:05,458
Look at this cloth and color.

586
00:38:05,542 --> 00:38:08,500
Red and green really suit your wife.

587
00:38:08,583 --> 00:38:09,583
Demon!

588
00:38:34,708 --> 00:38:36,375
A fruit spirit eating fruit?

589
00:38:37,292 --> 00:38:38,583
How cruel!

590
00:38:58,542 --> 00:38:59,542
Hide inside.

591
00:39:09,583 --> 00:39:12,000
- King white brows.
- King white brows.

592
00:39:14,125 --> 00:39:16,833
- All-powerful.
- All-powerful.

593
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:21,917
- Almighty.
- Almighty.

594
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:26,875
- A king unmatched.
- A king unmatched.

595
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:30,708
Who are you

596
00:39:30,792 --> 00:39:33,292
to stand in the way of king white brows?

597
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,583
I am...

598
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:37,833
Master shaves brows.

599
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,917
Cut up this scum into pieces

600
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,458
and eradicate that qi energy!

601
00:40:15,292 --> 00:40:16,417
Golden cudgel?

602
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:35,958
Sun wukong, the king of demon?

603
00:40:36,875 --> 00:40:38,833
No, stay back!

604
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:41,375
I won't hurt you!

605
00:40:54,083 --> 00:40:55,375
Monkey!

606
00:40:55,458 --> 00:40:56,958
Monkey!

607
00:41:27,708 --> 00:41:29,457
Don't let that qi energy escape!

608
00:41:29,458 --> 00:41:30,500
Chaseifl

609
00:41:32,583 --> 00:41:34,583
catch that qi energy!

610
00:41:53,333 --> 00:41:55,083
Monkey!

611
00:42:20,292 --> 00:42:22,167
Don't leave us behind, my lord!

612
00:42:44,167 --> 00:42:45,250
Let's go.

613
00:43:03,875 --> 00:43:05,625
Those folks won't survive.

614
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:07,832
Life is fleeting.

615
00:43:07,833 --> 00:43:09,375
Get used to it.

616
00:43:32,833 --> 00:43:35,083
Father!

617
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,958
Amitébha.

618
00:44:00,917 --> 00:44:01,917
Master?

619
00:44:23,042 --> 00:44:24,458
What happened, father?

620
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:31,666
My son!

621
00:44:31,667 --> 00:44:33,167
My son.

622
00:44:36,208 --> 00:44:38,667
Great master, what's wrong?

623
00:45:02,542 --> 00:45:04,541
This boy is a glutton

624
00:45:04,542 --> 00:45:06,292
just like me.

625
00:45:07,125 --> 00:45:08,749
Bajie, you like meat.

626
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:09,791
He's more like master.

627
00:45:09,792 --> 00:45:11,125
He only likes fruit.

628
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:18,042
Fruitie, hop on!

629
00:45:24,708 --> 00:45:26,500
Ancestor!

630
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,167
Ancestor!

631
00:45:31,542 --> 00:45:32,624
Ancestor,

632
00:45:32,625 --> 00:45:35,499
I was just about
to finish off that qi energy

633
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,166
when all of a sudden

634
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:38,791
sun wukong turned up

635
00:45:38,792 --> 00:45:39,957
with his golden cudgel

636
00:45:39,958 --> 00:45:41,917
and took my men by surprise!

637
00:45:42,083 --> 00:45:43,750
Bunch of losers.

638
00:45:44,458 --> 00:45:46,208
Ancestor!

639
00:45:46,292 --> 00:45:47,625
Ancestor!

640
00:45:47,708 --> 00:45:50,374
I have another brilliant plan!

641
00:45:50,375 --> 00:45:51,500
Ancestor!

642
00:46:03,458 --> 00:46:05,708
Sun wukong.

643
00:46:15,333 --> 00:46:16,499
Why must the mountain deity

644
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,332
live at the top of the mountain?

645
00:46:18,333 --> 00:46:20,417
I'm exhausted.

646
00:46:25,917 --> 00:46:27,416
When we confront primordium,

647
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:29,374
stay as far away as you can.

648
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:30,832
I'm going to seal him

649
00:46:30,833 --> 00:46:32,249
and help you save your master.

650
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:33,292
Stop it.

651
00:46:33,542 --> 00:46:34,749
He's my master.

652
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:35,792
I can save him.

653
00:47:06,292 --> 00:47:07,625
Poor mountain deity,

654
00:47:07,667 --> 00:47:09,208
you're so unpopular.

655
00:47:09,292 --> 00:47:10,372
Your tributes have spoiled,

656
00:47:10,417 --> 00:47:12,125
but no one's here to change them for you!

657
00:47:12,208 --> 00:47:13,917
His Dharma body isn't here.

658
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,375
Bajie, search the mountain with Sandy.

659
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,500
I will wait right here for him.

660
00:47:18,583 --> 00:47:19,458
I'm not going.

661
00:47:19,542 --> 00:47:21,667
He may be gone,
but his temple is still here.

662
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:23,625
Wouldn't it be sweet if we all wait here?

663
00:47:23,708 --> 00:47:24,792
Are you going or not?

664
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:27,250
No, find someone else who wants to.

665
00:47:34,958 --> 00:47:36,042
Monkey!

666
00:47:36,417 --> 00:47:39,542
Monkey, I admire you so much.

667
00:47:42,167 --> 00:47:44,375
If I can't do it, who can?

668
00:47:47,375 --> 00:47:49,542
Sandy, why are you just standing there?

669
00:47:49,625 --> 00:47:50,625
Come with me!

670
00:48:31,792 --> 00:48:34,875
Mountain deity temple

671
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:42,874
Monkey, I want some water!

672
00:48:42,875 --> 00:48:44,250
Troublesome!

673
00:48:47,667 --> 00:48:49,375
Monkey, I want to pee.

674
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:51,500
Hold it in.

675
00:49:14,417 --> 00:49:16,417
It's comfy.

676
00:49:18,833 --> 00:49:20,458
Not even my master

677
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,500
dares to piss on my head!

678
00:49:32,792 --> 00:49:34,542
You're so annoying! Get off!

679
00:49:40,667 --> 00:49:42,625
Sun wukong!

680
00:50:01,375 --> 00:50:03,458
Give me the qi energy.

681
00:50:08,625 --> 00:50:10,625
Fat chance.

682
00:50:30,833 --> 00:50:32,292
Everyone is here.

683
00:50:32,375 --> 00:50:33,417
Wind raccoon dog!

684
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:01,375
Wind raccoon dog.

685
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:03,000
This name rings a bell.

686
00:51:10,833 --> 00:51:11,958
I found it!

687
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,791
"Wind raccoon dog,

688
00:51:13,792 --> 00:51:15,082
a beast born from the wind,
comes and goes without a trace.

689
00:51:15,083 --> 00:51:16,791
It can't be killed by fire or blade.

690
00:51:16,792 --> 00:51:18,749
Only hammer strikes
by the thousands can kill it.

691
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:19,916
A gust of wind into its mouth

692
00:51:19,917 --> 00:51:21,083
immediately revives it.

693
00:51:23,458 --> 00:51:25,166
Stinker, aren't you fast?

694
00:51:25,167 --> 00:51:26,167
Keep running!

695
00:51:40,208 --> 00:51:41,249
Look.

696
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:43,417
Now, you're wind raccoon dog jerky!

697
00:53:10,583 --> 00:53:13,083
It's all ruined!

698
00:53:13,167 --> 00:53:15,792
No, it's all ruined!

699
00:53:15,875 --> 00:53:17,458
My temple!

700
00:53:17,542 --> 00:53:18,667
What happened to it?

701
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:19,958
Who did this?

702
00:53:20,042 --> 00:53:21,417
I won't spare him!

703
00:53:22,083 --> 00:53:23,833
Spill it. Where is primordium?

704
00:53:25,083 --> 00:53:26,417
Aren't you the great sage?

705
00:53:27,583 --> 00:53:29,041
After over 500 years of suppression,

706
00:53:29,042 --> 00:53:30,542
how are you still so handsome?

707
00:53:33,625 --> 00:53:34,791
Answer me. Where is primordium?

708
00:53:34,792 --> 00:53:37,333
Great sage,
you released primordium, didn't you?

709
00:53:37,667 --> 00:53:39,208
Why are you asking me?

710
00:53:40,333 --> 00:53:41,874
I know where he is.

711
00:53:41,875 --> 00:53:43,542
Quick! Come with me!

712
00:53:46,667 --> 00:53:47,958
Move your ass!

713
00:53:48,083 --> 00:53:49,792
Follow me now!

714
00:53:56,458 --> 00:53:58,042
Go! Keep up with him!

715
00:54:18,333 --> 00:54:19,208
Great sage,

716
00:54:19,209 --> 00:54:21,291
maybe I'm talking too much,

717
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:22,707
but demons all over must be coming

718
00:54:22,708 --> 00:54:25,082
to celebrate their ancestor's revival.

719
00:54:25,083 --> 00:54:28,375
Armies of demons must be on the way.

720
00:54:29,042 --> 00:54:31,082
Even a fierce tiger
is no match for a wolf pack.

721
00:54:31,083 --> 00:54:33,082
Besides, he is primordium.

722
00:54:33,083 --> 00:54:36,249
- He is...
- Big beard, don't worry.

723
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:37,291
Here I am.

724
00:54:37,292 --> 00:54:38,917
I can seal primordium away.

725
00:54:46,458 --> 00:54:48,875
The qi energy has taken a human form.

726
00:54:48,958 --> 00:54:50,917
If he uses qi energy,

727
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,875
he will deplete it one day.

728
00:54:52,958 --> 00:54:54,542
What happens then?

729
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:57,458
What do you think will happen?

730
00:54:57,542 --> 00:54:58,792
He'll die?

731
00:55:02,333 --> 00:55:04,250
Once his qi is depleted,

732
00:55:04,333 --> 00:55:06,167
he won't be reincarnated.

733
00:55:19,083 --> 00:55:20,083
Great sage,

734
00:55:20,875 --> 00:55:22,583
primordium is hiding over there.

735
00:55:22,958 --> 00:55:25,625
This mountain is called millennium peak.

736
00:55:26,125 --> 00:55:28,458
Millennium peak?

737
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,375
I must go.

738
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:37,832
The plants on the mountain

739
00:55:37,833 --> 00:55:39,292
cannot live without me.

740
00:55:39,583 --> 00:55:40,707
Just go.

741
00:55:40,708 --> 00:55:43,041
Excuse me, then.

742
00:55:43,042 --> 00:55:45,042
See you later.

743
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:49,333
Hold on.

744
00:55:59,375 --> 00:56:00,708
Thank you, great sage.

745
00:56:01,625 --> 00:56:03,291
Take my advice.

746
00:56:03,292 --> 00:56:04,582
Don't sacrifice yourself.

747
00:56:04,583 --> 00:56:06,999
If you seek help from Buddha now,

748
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,417
there might still be a way.

749
00:56:39,542 --> 00:56:40,792
My lord!

750
00:56:40,875 --> 00:56:43,958
Demons from mount crow
of the eastern continent

751
00:56:44,042 --> 00:56:45,125
request an audience!

752
00:56:45,208 --> 00:56:46,208
My lord!

753
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:47,917
Western continent's nine-headed monster

754
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,125
has entered millennium peak with his men!

755
00:56:50,208 --> 00:56:51,250
My lord!

756
00:56:51,333 --> 00:56:52,417
Demons from mount meru

757
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:55,875
have come to pay their respects!

758
00:57:08,083 --> 00:57:10,666
I am tawny lion from tiger's jaws cave

759
00:57:10,667 --> 00:57:12,458
at leopard's head mountain.

760
00:57:12,958 --> 00:57:14,666
Multiple-eyed creature

761
00:57:14,667 --> 00:57:16,792
from ghost king mountain.

762
00:57:19,875 --> 00:57:21,499
Nine-tailed Vixen

763
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,292
from dragon-suppressing cave.

764
00:57:24,208 --> 00:57:26,625
We're from lotus cave
at flat peak mountain.

765
00:57:26,917 --> 00:57:28,124
Golden horn.

766
00:57:28,125 --> 00:57:29,625
Silver horn.

767
00:57:32,375 --> 00:57:34,207
Congratulations on your revival

768
00:57:34,208 --> 00:57:36,249
with your original body!

769
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:38,624
Congratulations on your revival

770
00:57:38,625 --> 00:57:41,125
with your original body!

771
00:58:24,958 --> 00:58:27,791
Monkey, when do we attack primordium?

772
00:58:27,792 --> 00:58:29,083
Sleep now.

773
00:58:29,792 --> 00:58:30,750
No, I won't.

774
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:31,750
Sleep.

775
00:58:37,417 --> 00:58:38,458
Are you sleeping or not?

776
00:58:54,375 --> 00:58:56,707
Why is your name three syllables

777
00:58:56,708 --> 00:58:58,833
while mine is two syllables?

778
00:59:00,417 --> 00:59:02,250
Fruitie was just off the top of my head.

779
00:59:03,292 --> 00:59:05,207
I love being called fruitie.

780
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,167
I love this name!

781
00:59:10,958 --> 00:59:13,625
That's not really even a name.

782
00:59:16,542 --> 00:59:18,958
So who gave you the name sun wukong?

783
00:59:22,958 --> 00:59:24,083
My master.

784
00:59:25,375 --> 00:59:26,458
Do you know?

785
00:59:26,542 --> 00:59:28,333
It's a terrible-sounding name.

786
00:59:32,958 --> 00:59:34,167
It doesn't matter

787
00:59:34,667 --> 00:59:36,458
as long as I know who I am.

788
00:59:37,958 --> 00:59:40,042
Do you know who you are?

789
00:59:40,708 --> 00:59:42,124
I'm a demon

790
00:59:42,125 --> 00:59:43,792
that does nothing but evil.

791
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:47,249
There are good and evil demons.

792
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,042
Not all demons do evil.

793
00:59:50,042 --> 00:59:51,458
Are you sleeping or not?

794
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,666
I'm an evil demon.

795
00:59:54,667 --> 00:59:56,542
Don't you fear me?

796
00:59:58,333 --> 00:59:59,625
You are not evil.

797
00:59:59,708 --> 01:00:01,583
You have a kind soul.

798
01:00:02,375 --> 01:00:03,250
I don't have a soul.

799
01:00:03,251 --> 01:00:04,332
Why?

800
01:00:04,333 --> 01:00:06,500
I was born from a stone!

801
01:00:07,833 --> 01:00:10,333
A hard stone with no parents
and covered in hair.

802
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:13,958
That's so cool!

803
01:00:14,042 --> 01:00:15,917
I like stone monkeys.

804
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,292
Cool, my ass.

805
01:00:17,375 --> 01:00:18,500
You're always blabbering,

806
01:00:18,583 --> 01:00:19,958
just like my master.

807
01:00:20,042 --> 01:00:20,875
So promise me.

808
01:00:20,958 --> 01:00:22,542
Let's fetch scriptures together

809
01:00:22,625 --> 01:00:23,750
after we defeat primordium.

810
01:00:23,833 --> 01:00:26,042
Okay, I promise.

811
01:00:27,667 --> 01:00:29,875
Monkey, you're so kind.

812
01:00:51,375 --> 01:00:52,667
He's asleep.

813
01:01:09,667 --> 01:01:10,707
Are we going without fruitie?

814
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:12,750
Shut it. We can't go with him.

815
01:01:55,917 --> 01:01:57,457
I started this.

816
01:01:57,458 --> 01:02:00,083
I will finish the fight on my own.

817
01:02:04,083 --> 01:02:05,292
Wukong,

818
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:08,583
we ate those manfruits together.

819
01:02:09,042 --> 01:02:10,375
Sandy is right.

820
01:02:10,458 --> 01:02:11,833
Hog all the fun for yourself?

821
01:02:11,917 --> 01:02:12,917
No way!

822
01:02:14,167 --> 01:02:15,167
Okay.

823
01:02:49,708 --> 01:02:51,708
We haven't had a group battle in a while.

824
01:02:54,417 --> 01:02:55,542
Scumbags,

825
01:02:55,625 --> 01:02:58,292
take this cracking rake
from your piggy daddy!

826
01:03:04,667 --> 01:03:06,666
800 ii of flowing sands

827
01:03:06,667 --> 01:03:08,667
within which all shall sink!

828
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,250
Hammer of ninefold numinosity!

829
01:03:19,708 --> 01:03:21,833
Marshal of the heavenly canopy?

830
01:03:21,917 --> 01:03:24,333
You're nothing but a stupid pig.

831
01:03:26,083 --> 01:03:28,458
Do you think you will win with your bulk?

832
01:03:44,333 --> 01:03:45,917
You didn't see

833
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,667
the no man's land

834
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:53,167
where white bones lie uncollected.

835
01:04:03,333 --> 01:04:04,667
The one with all the eyes!

836
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:07,000
Do you see now?

837
01:04:20,458 --> 01:04:21,832
That's so lame.

838
01:04:21,833 --> 01:04:23,292
Play it to yama in hell!

839
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,542
Everyone, charge!

840
01:04:33,875 --> 01:04:35,875
Kill this pig!

841
01:04:41,792 --> 01:04:42,958
Sun wukong!

842
01:04:43,583 --> 01:04:46,042
I called your name. Dare you answer?

843
01:04:53,792 --> 01:04:57,291
Sun wukong, I called your name.

844
01:04:57,292 --> 01:04:58,625
Dare you answer?

845
01:05:00,083 --> 01:05:01,958
Who are you to say my full name?

846
01:05:02,792 --> 01:05:04,957
Buddy, use another magic weapon!

847
01:05:04,958 --> 01:05:07,249
Why won't he answer me?

848
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:08,332
You can keep trying.

849
01:05:08,333 --> 01:05:09,375
I'm leaving first.

850
01:06:13,417 --> 01:06:15,375
All the demons in the world

851
01:06:15,917 --> 01:06:18,833
have become so weak.

852
01:06:21,958 --> 01:06:23,208
The weak

853
01:06:23,792 --> 01:06:25,667
don't deserve to live.

854
01:06:26,042 --> 01:06:27,374
Sun wukong,

855
01:06:27,375 --> 01:06:29,167
give me the qi energy.

856
01:06:30,167 --> 01:06:31,250
Screw you!

857
01:06:33,208 --> 01:06:35,291
Give me my master!

858
01:06:35,292 --> 01:06:37,167
You all are seeking death.

859
01:08:19,542 --> 01:08:21,792
Is that all you have got?

860
01:08:25,208 --> 01:08:27,999
Wukong, tell fruitie

861
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,957
to use qi energy now!

862
01:08:29,958 --> 01:08:31,624
If he depletes it,

863
01:08:31,625 --> 01:08:33,833
fruitie will die.

864
01:08:42,292 --> 01:08:44,375
There you are.

865
01:08:54,292 --> 01:08:55,416
Monkey!

866
01:08:55,417 --> 01:08:56,208
Piggy!

867
01:08:56,209 --> 01:08:57,458
Sandy!

868
01:09:19,458 --> 01:09:20,667
Monkey!

869
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,292
Monkey!

870
01:09:24,667 --> 01:09:26,042
Monkey!

871
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:33,375
Fruitie, don't come out!

872
01:09:47,333 --> 01:09:48,750
Monkey!

873
01:09:50,917 --> 01:09:52,583
Wukong!

874
01:09:56,833 --> 01:09:58,125
I will fight you to the death!

875
01:10:00,208 --> 01:10:01,417
Old demon!

876
01:10:13,208 --> 01:10:14,333
Bajie!

877
01:10:14,708 --> 01:10:17,832
Sandy!

878
01:10:17,833 --> 01:10:19,792
Piggy!

879
01:10:30,667 --> 01:10:33,042
It's your turn, qi energy.

880
01:10:33,792 --> 01:10:35,541
Take on a human form,

881
01:10:35,542 --> 01:10:38,042
suffer as a human!

882
01:11:39,875 --> 01:11:42,458
You are such an idiot.

883
01:11:51,417 --> 01:11:52,707
Monkey!

884
01:11:52,708 --> 01:11:53,749
Fruitie!

885
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:55,082
Run!

886
01:11:55,083 --> 01:11:56,583
Get out of here!

887
01:12:14,583 --> 01:12:15,958
Monkey!

888
01:12:30,458 --> 01:12:33,416
Let me give you a hand

889
01:12:33,417 --> 01:12:35,333
to unite you in death.

890
01:12:38,458 --> 01:12:39,792
Wukong!

891
01:12:40,417 --> 01:12:43,499
- Wukong!
- Master!

892
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:45,292
Master!

893
01:12:56,375 --> 01:12:57,916
Golden cicada,

894
01:12:57,917 --> 01:12:59,874
all your disciples are here.

895
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:02,083
But none of them can save you.

896
01:13:08,458 --> 01:13:10,625
As master and disciples,

897
01:13:11,625 --> 01:13:13,625
I am content with this fate.

898
01:13:14,375 --> 01:13:16,624
Even if we are killed,

899
01:13:16,625 --> 01:13:19,208
our souls will never die.

900
01:13:23,833 --> 01:13:26,500
Give me your golden Dharma body!

901
01:13:43,708 --> 01:13:46,042
Master.

902
01:13:59,542 --> 01:14:02,125
Monkey, here!

903
01:14:06,167 --> 01:14:07,875
Go away.

904
01:14:12,417 --> 01:14:15,207
Monkey, you promised to take me along

905
01:14:15,208 --> 01:14:18,167
on the pilgrimage for scriptures!

906
01:14:23,958 --> 01:14:26,958
- Fruitie, go!
- No!

907
01:14:28,125 --> 01:14:29,917
Monkey!

908
01:14:32,167 --> 01:14:34,042
Don't hurt him!

909
01:14:39,583 --> 01:14:42,332
Only I can help them

910
01:14:42,333 --> 01:14:44,417
alleviate their pain

911
01:14:44,792 --> 01:14:46,708
and return them to the primal chaos.

912
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,417
Sun wukong,

913
01:14:48,667 --> 01:14:51,250
do you really deserve
to be king of demons?

914
01:14:51,667 --> 01:14:53,542
You have lost.

915
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,250
Lost?

916
01:15:00,708 --> 01:15:03,083
I would

917
01:15:03,542 --> 01:15:05,124
rather die

918
01:15:05,125 --> 01:15:08,083
than admit defeat!

919
01:15:13,708 --> 01:15:15,667
Then you shall die!

920
01:15:35,708 --> 01:15:38,458
Monkey!

921
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:57,749
Don't forget

922
01:16:57,750 --> 01:17:00,000
that his golden Dharma body is inside me.

923
01:18:23,625 --> 01:18:25,833
This is my world.

924
01:18:36,333 --> 01:18:38,583
Compliant golden cudgel

925
01:19:22,333 --> 01:19:24,750
Who the heck are you?

926
01:20:11,083 --> 01:20:12,291
Primordium,

927
01:20:12,292 --> 01:20:14,416
now I will tell you

928
01:20:14,417 --> 01:20:16,125
who I am!

929
01:20:36,250 --> 01:20:37,874
Icome

930
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:39,791
from water curtain cave

931
01:20:39,792 --> 01:20:41,124
at flowers and fruit mountain.

932
01:20:41,125 --> 01:20:43,207
I am the great sage equaling heaven,

933
01:20:43,208 --> 01:20:44,666
king of demons,

934
01:20:44,667 --> 01:20:46,792
sun wukong!

935
01:21:29,125 --> 01:21:30,833
Screw you!

936
01:21:37,750 --> 01:21:39,042
Remember.

937
01:21:40,167 --> 01:21:42,291
In this world,

938
01:21:42,292 --> 01:21:46,625
I am the strongest demon!

939
01:22:29,417 --> 01:22:31,042
I am a demon.

940
01:22:31,875 --> 01:22:34,625
But the biggest difference between us is

941
01:22:35,708 --> 01:22:37,417
I have a soul.

942
01:24:31,708 --> 01:24:33,125
Wukong.

943
01:24:42,208 --> 01:24:44,333
Master!

944
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,083
Master!

945
01:27:42,875 --> 01:27:45,291
This magic tree's life root is damaged.

946
01:27:45,292 --> 01:27:47,417
Not even I can bring it back to life.

947
01:27:53,375 --> 01:27:55,416
Goddess of mercy, who can heal it?

948
01:27:55,417 --> 01:27:56,499
I will find them!

949
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:57,957
Cheeky ape,

950
01:27:57,958 --> 01:28:00,082
the way to save this magic tree

951
01:28:00,083 --> 01:28:02,750
is right in your own hands, isn't it?

952
01:28:40,042 --> 01:28:41,083
Fruitie!

953
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,124
Monkey!

954
01:28:46,125 --> 01:28:48,875
I want to go on the pilgrimage with you!

955
01:35:08,917 --> 01:35:11,208
No hurry, children.
