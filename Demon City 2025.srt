1
00:00:07,666 --> 00:00:11,500
The moment when someone
is consumed by their desire for revenge

2
00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:14,333
is the moment they become a demon.

3
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:16,833
Now, with the traffic update.

4
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:19,500
There's a 2.5-kilometer traffic jam

5
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:22,166
at the Soma Interchange
on the Joban Expressway

6
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,750
heading towards Sendai.

7
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:29,125
The Shinjo bypass route is down
to one lane on the local roads.

8
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:33,250
This is due to the ongoing construction
in Ongyo Town, Shinjo City.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,750
On the southbound lane
of the Kijo Hirai Route

10
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:39,625
heading towards Mahitotsu Town,

11
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:43,166
a car accident has caused
a 2.5-kilometer traffic jam

12
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,166
in Shinjo City's
Torakuma Town First District.

13
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:49,375
The estimated time
from the Ogura intersection

14
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:51,333
to the Shiroyama intersection is…

15
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:24,166
Hmm? Repeat that.

16
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:26,541
What was that?

17
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:28,083
W… Well, uh…

18
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:30,541
"Do… do you realize how much we've…

19
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:35,083
we've been… protecting all of you,
all of this time"?

20
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:38,791
Uh, that's what I told the head of
the dockworkers' union to his face.

21
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:42,333
Out of nowhere, he said,
"We can't take orders from you anymore."

22
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:45,333
So I asked, "What are you guys up to?"

23
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:47,000
Mm.

24
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:49,958
And then?

25
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:52,083
Um, and then he said,

26
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:56,333
"If you keep ordering us around
about the port area, the entire city,

27
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:59,166
uh, the entirety of Shinjo City,

28
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,333
its structure, its people,

29
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:03,750
its history will bare their fangs at you."

30
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,583
The "structure…"

31
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:12,041
Shinjo?

32
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:13,750
Yes.

33
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:16,791
Also, "people" and "history."

34
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,166
So, those "things"
will be baring their fangs?

35
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,291
Yes.

36
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:28,250
What's he mean by that, huh?

37
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:32,166
Honestly, I'm not quite sure
what he meant by that.

38
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,708
-Come kneel.
-Y… Yes, sir.

39
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,000
What the hell happened?

40
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,875
What made him think
he'd be able to talk to us like that?

41
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,500
-Uh, um…
-Huh?

42
00:02:58,208 --> 00:02:59,708
Any idea?

43
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:02,041
Uh, I… I don't know, sir.

44
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,750
I think you need to do your job!

45
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:43,375
What the hell?

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,041
Let's go, boss.

47
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,208
-We're moving!
-Yes!

48
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,083
Upstairs!

49
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,375
What the hell happened here?

50
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,083
-Move!
-This way! Hurry!

51
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,416
Drive.

52
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,125
I said, drive!

53
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:30,041
Shit.

54
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,625
-What's going on?
-We need to go.

55
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:38,541
This way, sir.

56
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,375
Stop! Stop him!

57
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,125
Wait.

58
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:53,125
Please wait.

59
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:54,958
Please wait. Please wait.

60
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:21,375
Well done.

61
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:29,416
Hey, Sakata.

62
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,416
Maybe you shouldn't retire just yet.

63
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:48,166
I should've stopped you
from having a family.

64
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,750
I enjoyed working with you.

65
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:42,833
Oh!

66
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,250
It's Daddy!

67
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,791
Daddy's back.

68
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:52,541
Oh great!You are soaking wet!

69
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:55,125
Hey, Ryo, you're gonna be
all wet like Daddy. Whoa!

70
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:56,958
Oh no!

71
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,250
Yuck, hey! Stop it!

72
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,583
Normal people use umbrellas. Come here.

73
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,666
-Go wash up, okay?
-Mm-hmm.

74
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,708
Hold on, I'll be back.

75
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,750
Um, Ryo,

76
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,041
you grew a little bit, huh?

77
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,625
Mm, I think I grew a bunch!

78
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,083
A whole bunch, then?

79
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,708
Should we measure your height?

80
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:20,708
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

81
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,666
Here we go.

82
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,166
Okay. Right this way.

83
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,583
Let's wait for Daddy
to get out of the shower.

84
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,083
It's all done.

85
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,708
I'll look for a new job.

86
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,791
We'll celebrate.

87
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,500
With Ryo.

88
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:56,875
Mm-hmm.

89
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,041
Mm-hmm.

90
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,666
Go away!

91
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:32,541
No!

92
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:57,500
Daddy.

93
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,416
Welcome home.

94
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,791
Who would've thought
a top-tier hitman

95
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:14,166
would have such a warm
little family at home?

96
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:21,916
So who are you?

97
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:26,583
We're going to be running
all the business in this city from now on.

98
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:30,375
The yakuza group,
who had control of the port area,

99
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,708
was a real thorn in our side.

100
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:35,541
So thank you for eliminating them for us.

101
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,583
But what I've heard,
Mr. Sakata,

102
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:44,000
you're walking away from this job
for the sake of your family.

103
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,833
Get off, asshole!

104
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,208
Doesn't bruising him clash
with the whole suicide scenario?

105
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:07,708
Nobody will notice a few bruises.

106
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:08,833
I'll handle it.

107
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:09,958
Good.

108
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:13,625
Daddy! Don't hurt my Daddy!

109
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,166
Ryo!

110
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:23,416
Just please…
please let my daughter leave, please!

111
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,583
As her mother, I'm begging.

112
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,375
Please. Just please let her leave.

113
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:30,708
I'm begging you,
please don't hurt my daughter!

114
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:35,375
-Time to shut up, "Mother."
-Please don't hurt my baby!

115
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,083
Mommy?

116
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,500
Mommy?

117
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:54,541
Please…

118
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,166
don't pull the trigger.

119
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,083
Don't do it.

120
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,291
Daddy…

121
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:15,083
Ryo! Run away!

122
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,041
Sakata.

123
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,791
They say in Shinjo,

124
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,875
a demon lays dormant.

125
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,250
And once every 50 years,

126
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:58,000
the demon awakens,
possessing someone in this city,

127
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:01,375
and goes on a killing spree.

128
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:07,833
Our purpose
is to protect this city from this demon

129
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:09,833
and that person.

130
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:12,916
Please understand,

131
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,208
Sakata.

132
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:20,958
One day…

133
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,791
I'll kill all of you.

134
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,333
I'll find all of you.

135
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:37,708
You will?

136
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:46,625
I'll be waiting.

137
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,583
Last night,
at around 11:00 p.m.,

138
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:09,000
a shooting incident occurred
at a residence in Shinjo City.

139
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,750
The suspect
has been identified as Sakata Shuhei,

140
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,708
the father of a family of three.

141
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:16,625
Authorities believe that
Sakata shot his wife, Aoi,

142
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,375
their five-year-old daughter, Ryo,

143
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:21,000
and subsequently turned
the gun on himself.

144
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,458
Neighbors reported hearing
several loud sounds, similar to gunshots,

145
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:26,958
one after another.

146
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:50,083
12 YEARS LATER

147
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,875
I'll call you later
and tell you everything.

148
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,041
I'll transfer the money once I get it.

149
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,500
I have to go.

150
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,625
I'll call again. Okay, bye.

151
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,708
Hey, let's go.

152
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,875
Just until
a little over a decade ago,

153
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:33,500
Shinjo City
was like any other regional city.

154
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,958
It struggled greatly
with financial difficulties

155
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,541
as well as a declining population.

156
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:41,541
Mayor Sunohara, tell me,
what is your perspective

157
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:44,791
on the changes that have taken place
from then to now?

158
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,541
Shinjo City stands

159
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:51,958
at a significant milestone in history.

160
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:55,208
This didn't come along by chance,
you must understand.

161
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,666
This was made possible

162
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:03,750
only through the absolute
hard work, perseverance, and courage

163
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,666
of its wonderful citizens
over the past century.

164
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:11,833
This started to become possible
when you, Mayor Sunohara,

165
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,958
took office as Shinjo City's mayor,
in my humble opinion.

166
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:18,750
Many would agree with me.

167
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,291
That's really overstating it.

168
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,291
Mm-hmm.

169
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:25,041
Now, we're expecting tourists
from all over Japan

170
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,916
and some even say from all over the world,

171
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,125
to gather with us all here in Shinjo City.

172
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,416
Is that correct?

173
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,041
Yes. That's right.

174
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,458
Esteemed media.

175
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,083
We are just six months away
from the opening

176
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,500
of the integrated resort, Mahoroba.

177
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,166
A theater, a shopping floor,

178
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,333
a multitude of restaurants,
international conference facilities,

179
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:55,833
a hotel, as well as
Japan's very first full-scale casino.

180
00:18:55,916 --> 00:19:00,333
Every utopian desire
you can imagine can be achieved

181
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:04,000
here… at Mahoroba.

182
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,208
Do you have questions
for the mayor at this time?

183
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,708
Sir, you have a question?

184
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,750
I'm Kamiyama. I'm a journalist.

185
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:55,000
Shinjo City has seen a 15% increase
in missing persons in the last few years.

186
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,916
Among those is the leader in charge
of the construction's opposition.

187
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,416
Residents displaced due to redevelopment
have been quietly swept under the rug.

188
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,791
Can you keep your questions brief?
Please, sir.

189
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,750
Ah, apologies.

190
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:13,166
Shinjo City's transformation
into a better place was highlighted.

191
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,916
I'm wondering about
the increasing number of strange incidents

192
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,208
and unresolved cases.

193
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:18,416
I'd like to know.

194
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,666
Mayor Sunohara,
what are your thoughts on that?

195
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,875
You're bringing up things like

196
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:26,125
the increase in missing persons
and the opposing leader.

197
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:28,875
But where's your evidence?

198
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,541
When have you ever heard the police
make those statements?

199
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:35,250
-Well, the investigations I've conducted--
-Mr. Kamiyama.

200
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,416
Factual evidence matters here.

201
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,666
Facts only.

202
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:42,833
If your intention is to unfairly
harm this city's reputation,

203
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:44,416
I implore you.

204
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,416
Stop making false testimonies.

205
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,750
I've got it all right here--

206
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,125
I'm sure you're quite aware,
Mr. Kamiyama,

207
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,416
of the consequences of false rumors,
aren't you?

208
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,291
Do we have another question?

209
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:05,708
SHINJO INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX

210
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,541
Get out of here! No, it's not!

211
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:25,166
This place has changed quite a bit,
and it's only a decade.

212
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,250
Can you believe it?

213
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:23,125
Sorry… about this place.

214
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,458
We're working on finding
a safer place for you.

215
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:30,875
Look after him.

216
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,125
Yes, sir.

217
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:39,250
All right.

218
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:44,625
What the hell? Scars all over.

219
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:49,708
Mr. Sakata, time to eat.

220
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:54,041
Here you go.

221
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:09,333
He needs a lot of fresh air.

222
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,541
-Yes, sir.
-Take good care of him.

223
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:41,625
Huh?

224
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:46,916
Sakata!

225
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,083
Remember this?

226
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:52,500
You did this to me.

227
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
He can't comprehend what you're saying.

228
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:56,708
His body can't feel that!

229
00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:57,791
Stop that!

230
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:02,416
Who the heck is
this crazy person?

231
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:05,250
Sakata!

232
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:11,416
Damn it!

233
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:33,416
So they're called "Kimen-gumi."

234
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:36,958
Yeah.
I've never seen them myself though.

235
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:41,250
And it was 12 years ago.

236
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:43,875
Kono-gumi,
the yakuza group you belonged to,

237
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:47,833
held the rights to the port,
but then, the Kimen-gumi wiped them out.

238
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:49,583
And ever since that time,

239
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:52,333
they've been controlling the rights
all around the port area.

240
00:24:52,416 --> 00:24:53,791
That's including Mahoroba.

241
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:56,916
That's pretty much what happened.
Is that correct?

242
00:24:58,083 --> 00:24:59,416
Yeah, that's right.

243
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:02,625
A hitman who was hired
by Kimen-gumi attacked us

244
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:04,375
by himself.

245
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:10,000
So the attack by the hitman hired
by Kimen-gumi happened 12 years ago,

246
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:14,333
coinciding to when Mahoroba
was granted its business license.

247
00:25:14,416 --> 00:25:16,041
Which also coincides

248
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:19,458
to when Mayor Sunohara took office.

249
00:25:30,875 --> 00:25:34,791
Kimen-gumi started out by doing business
in human trafficking and drugs,

250
00:25:34,875 --> 00:25:37,416
so they were able to expand their power.

251
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:39,750
Trafficking humans?

252
00:25:39,833 --> 00:25:42,791
Shinjo City may seem prosperous
on the surface,

253
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,166
but that's because of the Kimen-gumi.

254
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:48,291
Huh?

255
00:25:56,916 --> 00:25:58,708
Oh, whoa, whoa.

256
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,625
What, what, what, what, what?

257
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:12,083
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

258
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:42,166
No, please.

259
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:44,500
I have a child to take care of.

260
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:47,500
I'll get out of here
the first thing tomorrow

261
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:48,875
and won't say anything.

262
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:51,291
I… I mean it. I swear!

263
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:11,125
A family.

264
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,416
All the more reason, right?

265
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:17,000
Place your finger right there.

266
00:27:35,291 --> 00:27:36,958
I'll handle the rest.

267
00:27:51,208 --> 00:27:52,041
Really?

268
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:55,666
That's impossible.

269
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:07,041
Sakata has a family that he loves.

270
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:10,416
He's leaving his job to take care of them,
so please let him go.

271
00:28:10,916 --> 00:28:13,208
You promised me
that you wouldn't kill him!

272
00:28:36,458 --> 00:28:37,333
What is it?

273
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:40,458
What?

274
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,041
Oh, Chief!

275
00:28:59,125 --> 00:29:00,541
I wasn't expecting you.

276
00:29:01,125 --> 00:29:02,458
What's going on?

277
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:04,916
Some drunk guy was picking a fight
in the neighborhood?

278
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,583
Yes, but… this guy here
was just released from a medical prison.

279
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:12,458
Seems like he might be
mixed up in something.

280
00:29:12,541 --> 00:29:14,750
That's why we were called in
to deal with it.

281
00:29:14,833 --> 00:29:16,958
You're working so hard.

282
00:29:17,041 --> 00:29:19,583
It's getting pretty late, isn't it?
You deserve a break.

283
00:29:19,666 --> 00:29:21,666
Head out and buy yourselves a drink.

284
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:24,875
Oh! We'll take you up on that.

285
00:29:24,958 --> 00:29:27,000
-Let's get a drink. Thank you, sir.
-All right.

286
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:28,291
-Thank you, sir.
-Sure thing.

287
00:29:28,791 --> 00:29:30,500
-See you tomorrow!
-Night!

288
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:34,500
-Where to?
-Someplace cheap.

289
00:29:42,833 --> 00:29:47,333
It's been such a long time, Sakata.

290
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,583
Do you remember me?

291
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:53,666
Look at you.

292
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,875
It's such a pity
you've ended up as a vegetable.

293
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:02,541
That night,

294
00:30:03,291 --> 00:30:06,166
when we realized
that you weren't dead yet,

295
00:30:06,666 --> 00:30:11,125
our master ordered us to let you live
for some reason.

296
00:30:13,041 --> 00:30:14,500
What a waste.

297
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:19,791
I should have just finished you off.

298
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:25,083
Twelve years.

299
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:28,375
Time has really flown by.

300
00:30:29,416 --> 00:30:30,750
Have you seen it?

301
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:32,833
The incredible progress?

302
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:35,458
Shinjo City. Right?

303
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:39,625
That beautiful city
was nearly on the brink of death.

304
00:30:39,708 --> 00:30:42,041
Do you remember, Sakata?

305
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:43,708
Ah, that's right.

306
00:30:43,791 --> 00:30:45,166
I should take a picture.

307
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:48,500
I need to capture
the moment of your death.

308
00:31:00,666 --> 00:31:02,166
Some resisted the changes.

309
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,541
Their feelings are understandable.

310
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:07,666
But what really matters

311
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:12,500
is having the courage
to overcome the fleeting grief.

312
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:58,916
Eat shit!

313
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:24,125
What the hell?

314
00:32:28,666 --> 00:32:31,166
-Hands up!
-Ah! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

315
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:36,333
Uh… Oh, sir. So sorry.

316
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:38,000
Are you hurt?

317
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:39,041
I'm fine.

318
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:40,458
I'm all right, yeah.

319
00:32:42,541 --> 00:32:43,916
What happened?

320
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,166
Ah, well, he flailed and fell off the bed.

321
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:49,666
Sorry, can you two help
put Sakata back up there?

322
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,083
Y… Yes, sir.

323
00:32:52,583 --> 00:32:55,291
Do you guys… Do you know each other?

324
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:57,041
Why do you ask?

325
00:32:57,125 --> 00:32:58,750
Well, you just…

326
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,875
I guess

327
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:04,833
a lot just happened.

328
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,000
Okay, let's do this.

329
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:08,916
Sure.
Uh, I'll grab his legs.

330
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,250
-Okay, ready?
-Ready.

331
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:12,333
Lift.

332
00:33:12,416 --> 00:33:14,583
-And swing.
-Swing.

333
00:33:14,666 --> 00:33:15,500
Swing.

334
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:17,583
And… there.

335
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:19,458
Huh?

336
00:33:24,416 --> 00:33:25,666
Leave the rest up to me.

337
00:33:26,166 --> 00:33:29,458
I'll just say that Sakata grabbed the gun
and shot him in front of me.

338
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:30,583
Thanks.

339
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:32,583
So, what's exactly…

340
00:33:41,458 --> 00:33:43,125
Oh, wait… What?

341
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:53,916
That's annoying.

342
00:34:48,375 --> 00:34:49,541
You asshole!

343
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:51,250
Please move back. Move back.

344
00:35:51,333 --> 00:35:52,541
You need to listen!

345
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:09,125
Seriously?

346
00:36:29,458 --> 00:36:30,291
Daddy.

347
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:32,250
Please let my daughter leave.
Please.

348
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,500
I'm begging you!

349
00:36:52,583 --> 00:36:54,416
-Start the car.
-Yes.

350
00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:06,791
-Batteries. The batteries.
-Yes.

351
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:08,500
-They should be here.
-Okay.

352
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:09,750
Don't mix them.

353
00:37:09,833 --> 00:37:11,583
And you forgot that one over there.

354
00:37:11,666 --> 00:37:12,500
Got it.

355
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:55,791
Mr. Shinozuka has been killed.

356
00:37:55,875 --> 00:37:56,875
What?

357
00:37:57,458 --> 00:38:00,458
At the hospital.
By Sakata Shuhei.

358
00:38:01,333 --> 00:38:03,125
-Sakata?
-Get over there!

359
00:38:04,291 --> 00:38:06,166
-That Sakata?
-Don't be scared.

360
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,458
Right. That Sakata.

361
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:12,833
He was just released
from a medical prison.

362
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,875
He was stabbed and taken to the hospital.

363
00:38:16,583 --> 00:38:20,041
Seems like
Mr. Shinozuka visited him and was killed.

364
00:38:20,833 --> 00:38:22,125
How's our master?

365
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:24,125
Well…

366
00:38:26,125 --> 00:38:28,500
he seemed like
he was pretty thrilled about it.

367
00:38:44,041 --> 00:38:45,375
So what's your location?

368
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,083
At the port.
Shipping them out.

369
00:38:49,916 --> 00:38:50,916
Oh, great.

370
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:54,166
The real question is,

371
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,625
how could he all of a sudden do all that
after being in a coma for 12 years?

372
00:39:10,833 --> 00:39:12,875
Do we have any idea where he is?

373
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Yeah.

374
00:39:17,666 --> 00:39:19,250
We know where he is.

375
00:39:22,041 --> 00:39:24,291
Right now, he's with Fujita.

376
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:33,375
FROM: UNKNOWN TO: AKIRA FUJITA
KILL HIM AND BRING ME HIS BODY

377
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,916
Sakata Shuhei.

378
00:39:40,416 --> 00:39:42,666
That demon is back.

379
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,541
He's wreaking havoc
in our Shinjo City again.

380
00:40:05,375 --> 00:40:06,500
Well…

381
00:40:10,833 --> 00:40:13,333
it's time to eliminate him for good.

SHINJO CLEANING SYSTEM

388
00:42:03,708 --> 00:42:05,541
Okay. Sakata confirmed.

389
00:42:09,583 --> 00:42:10,416
Good.

390
00:42:10,916 --> 00:42:12,625
So you just take care of the body.

391
00:42:38,833 --> 00:42:39,750
Let's go.

392
00:42:44,125 --> 00:42:46,041
Start the car.

393
00:42:46,541 --> 00:42:47,583
Yes. I'm sorry.

394
00:42:55,791 --> 00:42:57,041
Don't make it obvious.

395
00:42:57,541 --> 00:42:58,708
Yes, sir.

396
00:42:59,416 --> 00:43:00,791
You're full of crap.

397
00:43:01,291 --> 00:43:02,958
Three times a week? Where at?

398
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:04,375
Not a prostitute.

399
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:06,000
-What?
-She's not a prostitute.

400
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,375
-I bet you're lying.
-Why?

401
00:43:07,458 --> 00:43:08,833
-She's your girlfriend?
-Yeah.

402
00:43:08,916 --> 00:43:12,083
-No freaking way.
-Why's that so hard to believe?

403
00:43:12,166 --> 00:43:13,666
'Cause it's you.

404
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:14,916
You're full of crap.

405
00:43:15,791 --> 00:43:18,000
-For real.
-Yeah, right.

406
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,333
-This old man has a girl.
-For real?

407
00:43:20,416 --> 00:43:21,625
-It's the truth.
-Show us, then.

408
00:43:21,708 --> 00:43:23,083
Uh, fine, I'll show you guys later.

409
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:24,208
You're totally lying.

410
00:43:24,291 --> 00:43:26,375
-Why would I lie about that?
-Yeah, right.

411
00:43:30,958 --> 00:43:32,166
Huh?

412
00:43:41,125 --> 00:43:42,375
-Who the hell's that?
-Whoa!

413
00:44:01,083 --> 00:44:03,208
You are a traitor, Fujita!

414
00:44:10,916 --> 00:44:11,833
Hey.

415
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,250
Son of a bitch! Hey!

416
00:48:28,041 --> 00:48:29,083
Yeah?

417
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,625
It's not like you
to use such a forceful tactic, Ikkaku.

418
00:48:35,375 --> 00:48:37,083
Were you watching the whole time?

419
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:40,083
I apologize.

420
00:48:41,333 --> 00:48:43,666
I made you sacrifice your factory.

421
00:48:45,583 --> 00:48:46,666
Don't worry about it.

422
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:49,166
I planted a bomb in case of emergencies.

423
00:48:49,708 --> 00:48:52,208
I'm actually relieved that it did its job.

424
00:48:52,958 --> 00:48:55,333
Great. Thank you.

425
00:48:55,875 --> 00:48:57,166
It's nothing at all,

426
00:48:58,333 --> 00:48:59,291
Master.

427
00:49:01,708 --> 00:49:02,541
What?

428
00:49:03,958 --> 00:49:05,041
What is it?

429
00:49:16,791 --> 00:49:18,166
Impossible!

430
00:49:22,208 --> 00:49:23,625
Excuse me a moment.

431
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,333
That was impressive.

432
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:01,083
Sakata…

433
00:50:04,875 --> 00:50:05,958
I'm sorry…

434
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:10,541
about your wife and daughter.

435
00:50:11,416 --> 00:50:12,375
I'm the one…

436
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,750
I betrayed you.

437
00:50:17,083 --> 00:50:19,416
I deserve… to die.

438
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:23,250
Take care

439
00:50:24,666 --> 00:50:26,000
of them all how you want--

440
00:51:22,291 --> 00:51:23,875
Sakata.

441
00:51:24,958 --> 00:51:26,750
Tell you what.

442
00:51:27,666 --> 00:51:29,750
You have a narrow view of the world.

443
00:51:31,708 --> 00:51:34,333
You have a tiny little point of focus,
not like me.

444
00:51:34,416 --> 00:51:36,500
I almost feel sorry for you.

445
00:51:38,625 --> 00:51:40,125
We, on the other hand,

446
00:51:40,875 --> 00:51:42,375
are looking ahead

447
00:51:43,291 --> 00:51:46,041
to the distant future of this city,

448
00:51:46,125 --> 00:51:48,250
and, even more so, this country.

449
00:51:49,666 --> 00:51:51,500
We plan ahead and do

450
00:51:52,125 --> 00:51:53,041
what we need and--

451
00:51:58,791 --> 00:52:01,166
Hit me as many times as you want!

452
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:02,541
Yeah! Sakata!

453
00:52:05,791 --> 00:52:08,583
'Cause my loyalty is to our master.

454
00:52:09,375 --> 00:52:13,791
I swore that I would devote my body
and my soul for a better world.

455
00:52:13,875 --> 00:52:16,625
Can you even understand what that means?

456
00:52:16,708 --> 00:52:18,250
Ah, Sakata!

457
00:52:27,125 --> 00:52:29,291
MASTER

458
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:33,000
That's the person whom
you've probably been dying to meet.

459
00:52:42,041 --> 00:52:43,583
Is that you, Sakata?

460
00:52:44,166 --> 00:52:45,375
Finally, we speak.

461
00:52:45,458 --> 00:52:47,750
Master,
I didn't say a single word.

462
00:52:47,833 --> 00:52:49,166
Please be rest assured!

463
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:50,750
Not even once!

464
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:52,708
I believe you.

465
00:52:53,875 --> 00:52:55,458
Thank you.

466
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:57,333
Sakata.

467
00:52:57,916 --> 00:53:00,416
Stop murdering people for no reason.

468
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,250
We need Takemoto.

469
00:53:02,333 --> 00:53:04,833
-He's the man next to you.
-No. Not my mask!

470
00:53:07,708 --> 00:53:09,166
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

471
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:11,166
If you don't stop
hunting people,

472
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:14,833
you'll end up killing
every single resident in Shinjo.

473
00:53:14,916 --> 00:53:17,375
All these people need us.

474
00:53:17,458 --> 00:53:21,083
The people of this city survive
on the money we make.

475
00:53:21,166 --> 00:53:22,416
This world

476
00:53:23,125 --> 00:53:25,041
is a bit more complex…

477
00:53:25,125 --> 00:53:26,041
MAYOR RYU SUNOHARA

478
00:53:26,125 --> 00:53:28,166
…than you could ever imagine.

479
00:53:30,333 --> 00:53:32,625
Oh, by the way, Sakata,

480
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,375
uh, your daughter…

481
00:53:37,541 --> 00:53:38,625
she's alive.

482
00:53:43,333 --> 00:53:48,083
She's healthy and lives like
any ordinary high school girl.

483
00:53:53,083 --> 00:53:54,166
Although…

484
00:53:57,666 --> 00:54:01,583
I'm letting you know that if you keep
insisting on your petty revenge,

485
00:54:02,833 --> 00:54:06,541
I'm sure your little pea brain can imagine
what'll happen to your daughter.

486
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:12,000
It was a miracle
that little girl survived.

487
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:14,541
Sakata.

488
00:54:16,291 --> 00:54:17,500
It's Daddy!

489
00:54:23,875 --> 00:54:24,791
Come on.

490
00:54:25,458 --> 00:54:27,250
It's time to release me.

491
00:54:28,208 --> 00:54:32,875
Or else, your precious, lovely daughter
will be just a piece of meat.

492
00:55:12,833 --> 00:55:13,708
Ryo.

493
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:34,041
Last night in Shinjo City,

494
00:55:34,125 --> 00:55:38,250
where preparations are steadily
in progress for next year's opening

495
00:55:38,333 --> 00:55:42,583
of the integrated resort Mahoroba,
a series of terror attacks occurred.

496
00:55:43,166 --> 00:55:46,000
Yesterday, at around
seven o'clock in the evening,

497
00:55:46,083 --> 00:55:48,541
four police officers
were brutally murdered at…

498
00:55:48,625 --> 00:55:50,791
Thank you for your patience.
It's very hot.

499
00:55:50,875 --> 00:55:52,583
-Thank you. Looks good.
-Here's your miso.

500
00:55:52,666 --> 00:55:56,708
…a bomb suddenly exploded
in the Shinjo Cleaning System factory,

501
00:55:56,791 --> 00:55:58,166
destroying the building.

502
00:55:58,833 --> 00:56:01,833
The suspect, identified as Sakata Shuhei,

503
00:56:01,916 --> 00:56:05,625
was caught in the explosion
and has now been confirmed dead.

504
00:56:07,666 --> 00:56:10,083
Police are currently investigating
the suspect's motive

505
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:12,291
that led to this terrible reign of terror.

506
00:56:14,375 --> 00:56:16,083
I imagine that our residents

507
00:56:16,166 --> 00:56:19,000
had an incredibly restless night
last night, didn't you?

508
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:23,916
We're collaborating along with the police
and have already begun analyzing

509
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,750
the presumed suspect's behavior
leading up to the events that occurred.

510
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:33,583
Shinjo City is up against
a tall and very thick wall,

511
00:56:34,125 --> 00:56:36,958
the likes of which
it has… never faced before.

512
00:56:37,041 --> 00:56:38,125
Good morning.

513
00:56:38,625 --> 00:56:39,500
Good morning.

514
00:56:39,583 --> 00:56:42,083
…a sign that this city of ours

515
00:56:42,166 --> 00:56:43,958
will grow and transform…

516
00:56:44,041 --> 00:56:47,291
Seems like
things are getting kinda crazy.

517
00:56:47,375 --> 00:56:48,208
Mm-hmm.

518
00:56:48,291 --> 00:56:50,666
…keep striving against
this predicament we are in…

519
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:51,583
Oh crap!

520
00:57:08,666 --> 00:57:10,583
-Practice?
-Yeah.

521
00:57:11,166 --> 00:57:13,625
Oh, hey.
You didn't come home last night, did you?

522
00:57:15,708 --> 00:57:17,791
I put the leftovers in the fridge, okay?

523
00:57:18,583 --> 00:57:20,083
Eat them when you get hungry.

524
00:57:20,166 --> 00:57:21,000
Thank you.

525
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,708
INCOMING CALL
MASTER

526
00:57:28,291 --> 00:57:30,166
-Can you do the dishes?
-Yeah.

527
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:31,666
Oh no. Oh no.

528
00:57:32,166 --> 00:57:33,458
Have a safe trip, Ryo.

529
00:57:33,958 --> 00:57:34,791
Thanks!

530
00:57:42,416 --> 00:57:43,416
Hello?

531
00:57:45,375 --> 00:57:47,250
When will you find Sakata?

532
00:57:48,375 --> 00:57:49,625
I'm sorry.

533
00:57:50,208 --> 00:57:53,458
All of the employees are out there
searching the neighborhood for him still.

534
00:57:53,541 --> 00:57:55,791
It's quite possible that
he's already gone and left Shinjo.

535
00:57:56,583 --> 00:57:58,916
Sakata is still in Shinjo now.

536
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:00,791
He won't leave the city.

537
00:58:02,416 --> 00:58:03,291
Right.

538
00:58:04,541 --> 00:58:06,750
-He'll be filled with rage…
-Good morning.

539
00:58:08,041 --> 00:58:11,208
…when he finds out
that his own precious little daughter

540
00:58:11,291 --> 00:58:14,750
is being kept alive
just for your pleasure.

541
00:58:15,875 --> 00:58:17,583
I will get him. You'll see.

542
00:58:18,916 --> 00:58:20,250
I'm counting on you.

543
00:58:43,916 --> 00:58:47,208
SHINJO POLICE

544
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:49,458
-See you tomorrow.
-Yeah.

545
00:59:08,666 --> 00:59:10,333
I'm finally home.

546
00:59:17,958 --> 00:59:19,541
Why is that open?

547
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:29,916
Oh!

548
00:59:31,875 --> 00:59:32,750
What?

549
00:59:34,833 --> 00:59:36,375
Oh!

550
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,458
Oh my God.

551
00:59:41,041 --> 00:59:44,208
It's been quite a while, Mr. Sakata.

552
00:59:50,375 --> 00:59:53,208
I ended up working
at a local police station.

553
00:59:54,125 --> 00:59:55,625
I really went through a lot.

554
00:59:56,708 --> 00:59:58,916
Honestly, it's not gonna be as easy for me

555
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,958
to give you useful information
like I used to.

556
01:00:02,041 --> 01:00:05,416
But look at this person right here.
Look familiar? Right?

557
01:00:05,916 --> 01:00:08,958
That's the man you killed at the hospital.
Mr. Shinozuka.

558
01:00:09,875 --> 01:00:13,000
I worked
directly under that man back then.

559
01:00:13,791 --> 01:00:15,750
He treated me
to a lot of meals and drinks.

560
01:00:15,833 --> 01:00:16,750
It was great.

561
01:00:18,625 --> 01:00:20,208
He was basically the best boss ever.

562
01:00:22,375 --> 01:00:24,583
He had a lot of drive when he was young.

563
01:00:24,666 --> 01:00:27,125
Always eager to protect the citizens.

564
01:00:27,208 --> 01:00:29,458
We were pretty similar in that way.

565
01:00:34,041 --> 01:00:34,958
Look at her.

566
01:00:35,625 --> 01:00:38,166
This woman, she was his wife.

567
01:00:38,791 --> 01:00:39,750
Hiromi.

568
01:00:41,208 --> 01:00:42,833
She was a classy lady.

569
01:00:42,916 --> 01:00:45,750
She was modest.
Didn't really match this guy.

570
01:00:53,833 --> 01:00:54,708
Hey!

571
01:00:55,625 --> 01:00:56,708
That one's private.

572
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
He snuck out in the middle of the night.

573
01:01:04,125 --> 01:01:08,250
Apparently, he did this more than once,
and Hiromi got suspicious.

574
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:11,458
She figured he was cheating on her.

575
01:01:11,541 --> 01:01:16,083
So I decided to take it upon myself
and hired a detective to tail him.

576
01:01:17,208 --> 01:01:18,750
Use the evidence against him.

577
01:01:19,458 --> 01:01:21,541
That way, Hiromi and I could be together.

578
01:01:26,666 --> 01:01:28,916
Right here. Watch closely.

579
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,291
I'm scared.

580
01:01:30,375 --> 01:01:32,125
-Please, please.
-I'm begging you.

581
01:01:32,208 --> 01:01:33,333
Please don't kill us.

582
01:01:33,416 --> 01:01:34,333
Bang.

583
01:01:37,791 --> 01:01:39,916
Let me live! Let me live!

584
01:01:42,125 --> 01:01:43,000
Bang.

585
01:01:43,875 --> 01:01:45,208
Guess what he did.

586
01:01:47,958 --> 01:01:50,000
A few days after that incident,

587
01:01:50,083 --> 01:01:53,375
Mr. Shinozuka gifted me this.

588
01:01:54,458 --> 01:01:55,375
Look.

589
01:01:56,666 --> 01:01:58,291
It's Hiromi's finger.

590
01:01:59,208 --> 01:02:03,291
He gave me Hiromi's finger as a warning.
"Keep your hands off my wife."

591
01:02:04,333 --> 01:02:05,708
The man's insane.

592
01:02:07,791 --> 01:02:08,875
I mean, come on.

593
01:02:09,666 --> 01:02:12,458
Ugh, the nail polish started peeling off.

594
01:02:15,666 --> 01:02:18,208
Later on,
the detective I hired went missing too.

595
01:02:23,833 --> 01:02:25,583
The guy in the video who got shot

596
01:02:25,666 --> 01:02:29,833
was the CEO of the security company
that handled most of the public facilities

597
01:02:29,916 --> 01:02:31,875
around this area at that time.

598
01:02:37,625 --> 01:02:40,583
After he died,
a company by the name of Shinjo Security

599
01:02:40,666 --> 01:02:41,916
came into the picture.

600
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,958
They became the security
in charge of Mahoroba.

601
01:03:04,041 --> 01:03:04,916
Stop!

602
01:03:06,125 --> 01:03:08,000
Hey! You can't go in there!

603
01:05:04,458 --> 01:05:06,458
What the hell are you doing in my house?

604
01:05:10,958 --> 01:05:13,750
You can have my money.
There's no need for violence, all right?

605
01:05:17,666 --> 01:05:18,833
What have you done?

606
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:21,000
Huh? What'd you say?

607
01:05:23,625 --> 01:05:24,500
To Ryo.

608
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,750
What have you done with her?

609
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:19,916
Get off, asshole!

610
01:06:23,458 --> 01:06:25,166
Get off, asshole!

611
01:06:34,375 --> 01:06:35,208
What the hell?

612
01:06:40,166 --> 01:06:41,083
Dad!

613
01:06:49,625 --> 01:06:50,500
Ryo.

614
01:07:14,916 --> 01:07:16,583
Ryo, are you all right?

615
01:07:18,375 --> 01:07:19,416
Are you okay?

616
01:07:51,416 --> 01:07:52,500
You're insane.

617
01:07:52,583 --> 01:07:55,625
You rampaged at the hospital and factory,
and stormed into that building,

618
01:07:55,708 --> 01:07:58,583
and came back with an arrow
sticking out of your shoulder.

619
01:07:59,083 --> 01:08:00,500
You're out of your mind.

620
01:08:04,875 --> 01:08:06,625
Don't hurt my Daddy!

621
01:08:19,916 --> 01:08:21,750
All right. Here we go.

622
01:08:23,958 --> 01:08:25,041
Okay.

623
01:08:26,416 --> 01:08:28,166
Hang in there a little longer.

624
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:31,041
Okay? I'm pulling it out, okay?

625
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:33,333
One, two, three!

626
01:08:35,208 --> 01:08:38,083
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
This will help.

627
01:08:38,916 --> 01:08:40,416
I am not gonna let you die.

628
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:44,375
You saved my life once,
and now it's my turn to save yours.

629
01:08:46,125 --> 01:08:47,500
Press down on it with this.

630
01:08:52,958 --> 01:08:54,125
Who's calling me?

631
01:08:55,583 --> 01:08:56,750
Hello, who is this?

632
01:08:57,250 --> 01:08:59,791
This is
Officer Takigawa Yoshifumi, correct?

633
01:09:00,958 --> 01:09:03,083
Yeah, who is this?

634
01:09:03,791 --> 01:09:07,125
I've been told that
you used to work under Shinozuka.

635
01:09:07,208 --> 01:09:08,708
Yeah, that's right.

636
01:09:09,916 --> 01:09:11,791
Put Sakata on the phone.

637
01:09:15,250 --> 01:09:16,625
You got a call.

638
01:09:21,416 --> 01:09:22,416
How was it?

639
01:09:23,125 --> 01:09:25,333
You haven't seen each other
for quite a while.

640
01:09:27,791 --> 01:09:29,958
She's grown up well, hasn't she?

641
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:32,416
Pay attention.

642
01:09:34,166 --> 01:09:37,250
If you want your daughter
to live much longer,

643
01:09:41,125 --> 01:09:42,666
…come to Mahoroba.

644
01:09:45,958 --> 01:09:47,333
I'll be waiting for you.

645
01:09:53,708 --> 01:09:55,250
Don't be moving right now.

646
01:09:57,708 --> 01:09:59,083
Wait, you're driving?

647
01:09:59,166 --> 01:10:00,666
You're trying to drive?

648
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:03,166
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't be reckless.

649
01:10:04,458 --> 01:10:06,291
Careful! Be careful!

650
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:48,416
Whoa.

651
01:10:49,416 --> 01:10:51,291
You've been living here?

652
01:10:57,250 --> 01:10:58,291
Wow.

653
01:11:00,375 --> 01:11:01,833
Whoa.

654
01:13:04,083 --> 01:13:05,666
Delta 1. One car.

655
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:03,416
Shoot him!

656
01:16:54,375 --> 01:16:56,583
Just fucking die!

657
01:17:03,333 --> 01:17:06,166
Why don't you ever
just stay dead?

658
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:13,083
Why now? Why, after all this… time?

659
01:17:14,166 --> 01:17:16,541
She's finally starting to look hot.

660
01:17:20,291 --> 01:17:21,708
Enough!

661
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:23,458
Stop interfering!

662
01:17:45,166 --> 01:17:46,166
Ryo

663
01:17:47,125 --> 01:17:48,541
is mine.

664
01:17:52,666 --> 01:17:53,958
She's mine.

665
01:17:54,916 --> 01:17:58,000
I'm the one who raised,
clothed, and fed her.

666
01:18:22,708 --> 01:18:25,333
Ryo!

667
01:19:37,583 --> 01:19:38,458
Ryo.

668
01:19:53,166 --> 01:19:54,708
Ryo, I'm your dad.

669
01:20:01,041 --> 01:20:02,375
Do you remember me?

670
01:20:37,958 --> 01:20:39,416
We meet again,

671
01:20:40,875 --> 01:20:42,041
Sakata.

672
01:20:50,625 --> 01:20:52,541
Since time immemorial,

673
01:20:53,041 --> 01:20:56,125
this place has been known as
"The Town of Demonic Possession."

674
01:20:58,625 --> 01:21:00,750
There's a demon in Shinjo.

675
01:21:02,958 --> 01:21:04,333
Your school teach you that?

676
01:21:11,541 --> 01:21:12,500
Or not?

677
01:21:17,416 --> 01:21:18,875
I'm sorry.

678
01:21:21,708 --> 01:21:27,583
Disregarding local legends
like this is… so disrespectful.

679
01:21:29,291 --> 01:21:32,000
I'm going to have to reprimand
the Board of Education.

680
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:34,875
Actually,

681
01:21:36,458 --> 01:21:39,583
we're on a similar page now, in a way.

682
01:21:40,833 --> 01:21:42,416
To be completely honest,

683
01:21:43,875 --> 01:21:46,500
I've never seen a demon myself.

684
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,208
It would be great if I could see one.

685
01:21:54,083 --> 01:21:55,500
But somehow…

686
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:01,000
I'm not sure why you haven't
let the demon out yet.

687
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:06,875
Don't do it.

688
01:22:08,916 --> 01:22:09,958
I'm begging you.

689
01:22:12,291 --> 01:22:14,416
Well then, Sakata…

690
01:22:18,083 --> 01:22:19,750
let's see the demon.

691
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:37,958
Ryo!

692
01:22:42,208 --> 01:22:43,041
Ryo!

693
01:22:43,125 --> 01:22:44,666
Run away!

694
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:56,791
Run away!

695
01:23:13,041 --> 01:23:14,250
Come on!

696
01:25:46,791 --> 01:25:47,791
Does it hurt?

697
01:25:49,958 --> 01:25:51,583
You poor thing.

698
01:26:05,208 --> 01:26:06,041
Ryu.

699
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:09,666
This is your twin brother,

700
01:26:11,041 --> 01:26:11,875
Jin.

701
01:26:13,625 --> 01:26:15,000
Help each other out.

702
01:26:15,875 --> 01:26:18,166
Be there for each other from now on.

703
01:27:15,208 --> 01:27:16,291
Oh, whoa!

704
01:27:17,291 --> 01:27:18,250
Look at that.

705
01:27:21,666 --> 01:27:22,833
They're all dead.

706
01:27:23,416 --> 01:27:25,500
All right, follow me.

707
01:27:32,583 --> 01:27:33,750
My dad.

708
01:27:42,583 --> 01:27:44,333
What? Hey, come back!

709
01:27:49,625 --> 01:27:51,166
Do what you want. You're on your own.

710
01:28:02,791 --> 01:28:07,000
They say in Shinjo,
a demon lays dormant.

711
01:28:07,708 --> 01:28:09,583
And once every 50 years,

712
01:28:10,083 --> 01:28:14,500
the demon awakens,
possessing someone in this city,

713
01:28:15,333 --> 01:28:17,791
and goes on a killing spree.

714
01:28:19,416 --> 01:28:20,333
Our purpose

715
01:28:20,416 --> 01:28:24,333
is to protect this city
from this demon and that person.

716
01:28:39,041 --> 01:28:40,166
It's time.

717
01:28:41,666 --> 01:28:43,250
Bring out the demon.

718
01:30:51,125 --> 01:30:52,250
Are you…

719
01:30:54,958 --> 01:30:55,916
You are.

720
01:31:01,708 --> 01:31:02,625
The demon…

721
01:31:04,666 --> 01:31:05,708
of Shinjo.

722
01:31:06,291 --> 01:31:07,125
I knew it.

723
01:33:22,541 --> 01:33:23,500
Ryo!

724
01:33:28,208 --> 01:33:29,541
Are you all right?

725
01:33:30,583 --> 01:33:31,916
Thank goodness!

726
01:33:37,458 --> 01:33:38,458
What?

727
01:33:41,125 --> 01:33:42,250
Ryo!

728
01:33:42,875 --> 01:33:44,500
What's wrong? What is it?

729
01:33:49,625 --> 01:33:51,166
This isn't right.

730
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:53,875
What do you mean?

731
01:33:53,958 --> 01:33:55,083
What's "not right?"

732
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,500
You tricked me.

733
01:34:00,166 --> 01:34:02,666
You're the one. You killed my mother!

734
01:34:02,750 --> 01:34:04,625
Ryo!

735
01:34:04,708 --> 01:34:06,916
I'm your father.

736
01:34:25,583 --> 01:34:26,416
Daddy?

737
01:34:30,416 --> 01:34:31,416
Daddy?

738
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:33,250
You can't die, okay?

739
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:39,958
Ryo.

740
01:34:44,416 --> 01:34:45,500
Your mother…

741
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,541
…I couldn't protect her.

742
01:34:52,791 --> 01:34:54,208
I'm sorry.

743
01:35:29,416 --> 01:35:31,750
Look how much you've grown.

744
01:35:41,958 --> 01:35:43,875
I wish I could've been there.

745
01:35:52,291 --> 01:35:54,250
Dad? No!

746
01:35:54,791 --> 01:35:56,083
Please don't die!

747
01:36:01,291 --> 01:36:02,833
Dad, you can't die.

748
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:05,500
Daddy.

749
01:36:06,375 --> 01:36:08,125
I just got you back!

750
01:36:11,916 --> 01:36:12,833
Daddy!

751
01:36:17,875 --> 01:36:19,541
Please don't leave!

752
01:37:00,333 --> 01:37:01,791
Turn all the lights on.

753
01:37:16,333 --> 01:37:17,583
Coming through.

754
01:38:01,666 --> 01:38:04,875
1 YEAR LATER

755
01:38:18,833 --> 01:38:22,083
Mayor Sunohara,
congratulations on defeating your rivals

756
01:38:22,166 --> 01:38:23,750
and winning reelection.

757
01:38:23,833 --> 01:38:26,958
I'd like to address the citizens
and express my gratitude.

758
01:38:28,250 --> 01:38:29,166
Last year,

759
01:38:29,875 --> 01:38:32,458
a number of incidents occurred,
one after another.

760
01:38:33,625 --> 01:38:36,666
Being mayor,
I feel somehow responsible for it all.

761
01:38:36,750 --> 01:38:40,333
But Mayor Sunohara,
I have heard quite the opposite.

762
01:38:40,416 --> 01:38:42,416
You put your life on the line and fought

763
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:45,416
and even sustained
a serious injury at the crime scene.

764
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:46,541
Right.

765
01:38:47,750 --> 01:38:51,166
Perhaps it's because
I'm experienced in martial arts.

766
01:38:52,583 --> 01:38:54,541
I didn't think twice about intervening.

767
01:38:56,291 --> 01:38:57,166
I just…

768
01:39:05,958 --> 01:39:10,166
And the opening of Mahoroba,
which had been delayed,

769
01:39:10,250 --> 01:39:12,291
is going to have its grand opening.

770
01:39:13,541 --> 01:39:14,416
Yes.

771
01:39:15,166 --> 01:39:17,000
People will be coming from all over.

772
01:39:18,166 --> 01:39:22,583
Shinjo City will be reborn
and represent Japan on the world stage.

773
01:39:25,291 --> 01:39:26,250
It was

774
01:39:27,333 --> 01:39:29,833
the dearest wish of all who perished

775
01:39:30,791 --> 01:39:33,375
in that series of unfortunate events.
