completely true or whatever,

2262
01:46:41,786 --> 01:46:43,309
it's just what I've heard,

2263
01:46:43,353 --> 01:46:45,007
but, uh, your brain

2264
01:46:45,050 --> 01:46:46,487
has to knock out
some old memories

2265
01:46:46,530 --> 01:46:49,359
to be able to save new ones.

2266
01:46:49,403 --> 01:46:51,970
So I feel like there's
two types of Americans, like,

2267
01:46:52,014 --> 01:46:53,842
people who can constantly
get what they want

2268
01:46:53,885 --> 01:46:55,321
and have what they need,

2269
01:46:55,365 --> 01:46:56,671
and then there's
the other type

2270
01:46:56,714 --> 01:46:58,324
where they kind of
have to struggle

2271
01:46:58,368 --> 01:47:02,328
and work harder for the
things that they need.

2272
01:47:02,372 --> 01:47:04,069
It's not
the way we look,

2273
01:47:04,113 --> 01:47:06,724
but it's, like, how we are
on the inside that's...

2274
01:47:06,768 --> 01:47:10,380
Just like you can't judge
a book by its cover,

2275
01:47:10,424 --> 01:47:13,601
it's the same with humans.

2276
01:47:13,644 --> 01:47:17,518
So I like to look at
the positive side of things.

2277
01:47:17,561 --> 01:47:20,434
Um, I like to think about,

2278
01:47:20,477 --> 01:47:22,348
um, like new
inventions that might

2279
01:47:22,392 --> 01:47:25,395
actually help save the world.

2280
01:47:25,439 --> 01:47:28,964
I think about going into space
and discovering a new planet

2281
01:47:29,007 --> 01:47:32,794
and then maybe like
building a life there.

2282
01:47:32,837 --> 01:47:35,405
What do you hope
that you really remember

2283
01:47:35,449 --> 01:47:37,581
about your mom and your dad?

2284
01:47:37,625 --> 01:47:39,844
That they were
always there for me,

2285
01:47:39,888 --> 01:47:43,021
that they always love me.
They say...[CHUCKLES]

2286
01:47:43,065 --> 01:47:44,675
I tell her

2287
01:47:44,719 --> 01:47:47,461
good night
every night and...

2288
01:47:47,504 --> 01:47:50,202
[SNIFFLES] I always tell
her that I love her,

2289
01:47:50,246 --> 01:47:52,596
just like out of the blue
and she would do the same.

2290
01:47:52,640 --> 01:47:54,337
[VOICE BREAKS]
And I really feel

2291
01:47:54,380 --> 01:47:56,339
that strong
connection with her.

2292
01:47:56,382 --> 01:47:59,864
If you could
have any superpower,

2293
01:47:59,908 --> 01:48:01,779
what would it be?

2294
01:48:01,823 --> 01:48:04,042
The ability to
bend space and time.

2295
01:48:04,086 --> 01:48:06,697
[JOHNNY AND BOY 6 CHUCKLE]

2296
01:48:06,741 --> 01:48:09,787
If you were what
you believe is a good person

2297
01:48:09,831 --> 01:48:11,746
and you ask whoever
you believe in,

2298
01:48:11,789 --> 01:48:13,835
Hey, can I be reincarnated

2299
01:48:13,878 --> 01:48:15,619
into, I don't know,
like a tiger?

2300
01:48:15,663 --> 01:48:17,447
And you were a good person
then they would be like,

2301
01:48:17,491 --> 01:48:18,883
Yeah, you can be a
tiger, go ahead.

2302
01:48:18,927 --> 01:48:21,930
[TRAIN CHUGGING]

2303
01:48:21,973 --> 01:48:25,194
Well, I feel
like if we die,

2304
01:48:25,237 --> 01:48:27,544
like, we don't
really feel anything,

2305
01:48:27,588 --> 01:48:29,720
all like memories
are gone and stuff.

2306
01:48:29,764 --> 01:48:32,244
And we're just like,
we'll just see you wait

2307
01:48:32,288 --> 01:48:34,856
becoming a baby.[CHUCKLES]

2308
01:48:34,899 --> 01:48:36,379
And, yeah,

2309
01:48:36,422 --> 01:48:38,860
getting born and then
just restarting life.

2310
01:48:38,903 --> 01:48:42,211
Like, I'm not sure 'cause
I've never been dead before.

2311
01:48:43,429 --> 01:48:44,561
Sit down

2312
01:48:44,605 --> 01:48:46,781
and close your eyes,

2313
01:48:46,824 --> 01:48:49,914
and try to find yourself.

2314
01:48:49,958 --> 01:48:54,310
Because I feel like that's
what you really have to do,

2315
01:48:54,353 --> 01:48:56,486
to know what you want.

2316
01:48:56,530 --> 01:49:01,273
Like, find a way that you feel
comfortable finding yourself.

2317
01:49:02,884 --> 01:49:05,539
You know, you gotta
find to find.
