3
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,554
Hello!

4
00:01:17,294 --> 00:01:18,861
English, please.

5
00:01:18,904 --> 00:01:21,690
I'm surrounded by idiots.

6
00:01:21,733 --> 00:01:23,474
That girl is a lot.

7
00:01:35,965 --> 00:01:39,229
I told you, Pugsley.
It's push, not pull.

8
00:01:39,273 --> 00:01:40,578
Hello, everyone!

9
00:01:41,318 --> 00:01:42,493
I can't believe

10
00:01:42,537 --> 00:01:44,756
parents let their children
go out like this.

11
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,672
They're all so clean,

12
00:01:47,716 --> 00:01:49,109
shiny.

13
00:01:49,152 --> 00:01:50,936
Oh, it's not all bad,
my dear.

14
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,721
At least they pit the children
against each other

15
00:01:52,764 --> 00:01:54,157
in a competition

16
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:56,594
that will inevitably scar
the losers forever.

17
00:01:56,638 --> 00:01:59,945
Behold!
The gift of Prometheus!

18
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,300
Ugh.

19
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:08,302
Step aside, kid.

20
00:02:08,345 --> 00:02:09,781
I'll show you how it's done.

21
00:02:13,176 --> 00:02:14,221
- What?

22
00:02:14,264 --> 00:02:16,136
-

23
00:02:17,267 --> 00:02:19,313
Ladies and gentlemen.

24
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:23,012
Come on, come on.
Wednesday is next.

25
00:02:23,055 --> 00:02:25,667
Have you ever
found yourself discontented

26
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,408
by those closest to you?

27
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:30,019
Are you irked
by their inability

28
00:02:30,062 --> 00:02:33,065
to heed simple requests?

29
00:02:33,109 --> 00:02:37,026
Such as, "Please don't come
to my science fair."

30
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:39,115
She's talking about us.

31
00:02:40,638 --> 00:02:42,118
Do you ever wish
you could take

32
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,946
their undesirable qualities

33
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:46,818
and eliminate them forever?

34
00:02:46,862 --> 00:02:48,994
It can be done.

35
00:02:49,038 --> 00:02:51,736
Meet my Uncle Fester.

36
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,998
Hello!

37
00:02:53,042 --> 00:02:54,913
-

38
00:02:54,957 --> 00:02:56,480
-That's my brother.

39
00:02:56,524 --> 00:02:58,090
Observe.

40
00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:00,615
Hmm.

41
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,574
-Mm.

42
00:03:08,492 --> 00:03:09,885
- Come on!

43
00:03:09,928 --> 00:03:11,930
Stomach-turning, isn't it?

44
00:03:11,974 --> 00:03:13,584
In stark contrast, however,

45
00:03:14,672 --> 00:03:16,413
is Socrates.

46
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:19,677
Aw.

47
00:03:19,721 --> 00:03:21,679
Psst! Are you gonna eat that?

48
00:03:21,723 --> 00:03:24,595
This led me
to ponder the question,

49
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,077
what if personality traits
could be extracted

50
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,427
and implanted
between creatures?

51
00:03:40,002 --> 00:03:41,395
Bottoms up.

52
00:03:44,876 --> 00:03:45,877
Ooh.

53
00:03:56,932 --> 00:03:59,282
Yay! All right!
Thank you, thank you.

54
00:03:59,326 --> 00:04:00,370
What happened?

55
00:04:02,198 --> 00:04:04,548
Is there a single person

56
00:04:04,592 --> 00:04:06,246
in the history of the world

57
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:08,248
who's made more
of a breakthrough?

58
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,772
She's an enfant terrible.

59
00:04:10,815 --> 00:04:13,731
With the focus on terrible.

60
00:04:13,775 --> 00:04:18,910
Cara mia,you know
what French does to me.

61
00:04:18,954 --> 00:04:23,524
And now, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

62
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:25,874
Here to present the awards
at this year's

63
00:04:25,917 --> 00:04:28,180
Strange Foundation
National Science Fair,

64
00:04:28,224 --> 00:04:29,791
is the brilliant innovator

65
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:34,448
and the namesake
of our foundation,
Cyrus Strange.

66
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:38,539
Hello, everyone.

67
00:04:38,582 --> 00:04:39,888
Oh!

68
00:04:39,931 --> 00:04:42,107
I'm so honored to be here.

69
00:04:42,151 --> 00:04:45,110
But, well,
I'm not actually there, I'm...

70
00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:46,851
-

71
00:04:47,722 --> 00:04:49,158
Well, you get it.

72
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:51,160
Welcome to this year's
science fair.

73
00:04:51,203 --> 00:04:52,509
I'm excited
to honor this group

74
00:04:52,553 --> 00:04:54,555
of brilliant minds
we have before us.

75
00:04:54,598 --> 00:04:56,339
Let's proceed.

76
00:04:56,383 --> 00:04:58,559
And the winner is...

77
00:04:58,602 --> 00:04:59,951
-Good luck.
-

78
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:03,694
Oh. You were serious.

79
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,611
Everyone who participated.

80
00:05:07,655 --> 00:05:09,874
-What?
- That's right.

81
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:12,964
This year,
we are embracing
a new philosophy.

82
00:05:13,008 --> 00:05:15,489
Just trying
makes you a winner.

83
00:05:15,532 --> 00:05:18,840
But how can you be a winner
if no one is a loser?

84
00:05:18,883 --> 00:05:21,712
Every single
one of you is special.

85
00:05:21,756 --> 00:05:22,931
Disagree.

86
00:05:22,974 --> 00:05:23,975
He's not special.

87
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:26,326
Did you see his volcano?

88
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:28,371
What was that? Baking soda?

89
00:05:28,415 --> 00:05:29,938
Is this the third grade?

90
00:05:29,981 --> 00:05:32,027
It does not count!

91
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,637
Don't you get it?

92
00:05:33,681 --> 00:05:36,597
-Ugh.
-I get it, Wednesday.

93
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,946
I watched your presentation.

94
00:05:37,989 --> 00:05:39,991
It was brilliant.

95
00:05:40,035 --> 00:05:41,993
Yes, I'm aware of that.

96
00:05:42,037 --> 00:05:43,778
I see a kindred spirit in you.

97
00:05:43,821 --> 00:05:46,607
Mm-hmm.
The makings of a great mind.

98
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,087
If you'd like to share
your research with me,

99
00:05:49,131 --> 00:05:51,351
I could develop it further
in my lab.

100
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:53,178
Imagine what would happen

101
00:05:53,222 --> 00:05:56,530
if we combined your data
with the proper resources?

102
00:05:56,573 --> 00:05:59,315
Alas, I can't share
any of that.

103
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,795
It's a family secret.

104
00:06:00,838 --> 00:06:02,579
I see.

105
00:06:02,623 --> 00:06:05,060
And which family is yours?

106
00:06:05,103 --> 00:06:06,104
Fire in the hole!

107
00:06:08,063 --> 00:06:09,151
Oh.

108
00:06:10,587 --> 00:06:12,415
Pretty hot, eh, ladies?

109
00:06:13,024 --> 00:06:14,983
Nice job, Romeo.

110
00:06:18,682 --> 00:06:21,859
For more

111
00:06:24,993 --> 00:06:27,778
Morticia, my queen,

112
00:06:27,822 --> 00:06:29,650
you inflame me.

113
00:06:29,693 --> 00:06:33,001
I feel liquid magma
lapping at my body.

114
00:06:33,044 --> 00:06:34,785
You're on fire, dear.

115
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:36,570
Ha! So I am!

116
00:06:39,747 --> 00:06:41,401
My condolences.

117
00:07:16,131 --> 00:07:19,439
Great thinkers need
obstacles to function.

118
00:07:19,482 --> 00:07:21,832
Yet, with every
meaningless trophy,

119
00:07:21,876 --> 00:07:25,619
I become more
and more unremarkable.

120
00:07:25,662 --> 00:07:30,319
And with every hug,
more brain cells erode.

121
00:07:30,362 --> 00:07:33,583
But, like the phoenix
from the ashes,

122
00:07:33,627 --> 00:07:36,281
I shall rise above
this setback.

123
00:07:37,587 --> 00:07:41,025
Together, we shall turn heads,
Socrates.

124
00:07:42,331 --> 00:07:44,768
Starting with Pugsley.

125
00:07:44,812 --> 00:07:45,900
-

126
00:07:48,206 --> 00:07:50,731
-Love hurts, huh, kid?
-Huh?

127
00:07:50,774 --> 00:07:53,124
Well, I saw you
swing and miss horribly

128
00:07:53,168 --> 00:07:55,518
with the ladies
at the science fair.

129
00:07:55,562 --> 00:07:59,000
So, I thought
you should read my book!

130
00:07:59,043 --> 00:08:03,918
The Fester Method: How to Woo
and Other Tips on Love.

131
00:08:05,267 --> 00:08:06,486
You wrote this?

132
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:08,313
Self-published,
on the Internet.

133
00:08:08,357 --> 00:08:10,228
Not easy to do.

134
00:08:10,272 --> 00:08:13,231
Pugsley, I've been
on three first dates.

135
00:08:13,275 --> 00:08:16,670
I mean, who else
has that kind of experience?

136
00:08:20,064 --> 00:08:23,677
I know this, uh,
goes against guy code,

137
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,548
but what are you doing
Friday night?

138
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:27,550
-

139
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,294
Hey, you kids,
come on down here.

140
00:08:32,337 --> 00:08:33,513
It's dinner time.

141
00:08:33,556 --> 00:08:35,384
Mmm.

142
00:08:35,427 --> 00:08:36,603
-Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!

143
00:08:37,908 --> 00:08:40,215
It's dinner time,
my favorite nighttime meal!

144
00:08:40,258 --> 00:08:41,433
My balls!

145
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:45,089
-uh-oh, my head!

146
00:08:48,092 --> 00:08:50,138
Mmm.

147
00:08:51,182 --> 00:08:52,140
Oh!

148
00:08:53,445 --> 00:08:55,230
-

149
00:08:55,273 --> 00:08:57,145
Please, Uncle Fester,
wait for the children.

150
00:08:57,188 --> 00:08:58,625
Children?

151
00:08:58,668 --> 00:09:00,757
I thought
we were having chicken.

152
00:09:00,801 --> 00:09:02,454
Where are those two?

153
00:09:02,498 --> 00:09:04,848
Pugsley may have an appetite
for destruction,

154
00:09:04,892 --> 00:09:07,024
but it's never a match
for his stomach.

155
00:09:07,068 --> 00:09:08,504
I wouldn't wait on Pugsley.

156
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,985
Kid's got
a lot of homework to do.

157
00:09:11,028 --> 00:09:12,552
This generation.

158
00:09:12,595 --> 00:09:14,554
Let's at least wait
for Wednesday.

159
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:18,514
Why does nobody in this family

160
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,168
come in
through the front door?

161
00:09:20,211 --> 00:09:22,257
"Dearest Mother and Father,

162
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,216
I will not be attending
this evening's
ritual mastication."

163
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,522
I guess she's not hungry.

164
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,524
"It's not that I'm not hungry,

165
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,526
I am just choosing
to spare myself

166
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,660
the agony of your compliments
on my performance today

167
00:09:33,703 --> 00:09:36,750
and your needy attempt
to hang my award
above the fireplace."

168
00:09:36,793 --> 00:09:38,621
I should go
try to talk to her.

169
00:09:38,665 --> 00:09:40,362
"Don't try to talk to me.

170
00:09:40,405 --> 00:09:41,668
I want to be alone."

171
00:09:41,711 --> 00:09:44,235
We should bring her
a plate at least.

172
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,411
"P.S. Don't even
bring me a plate."

173
00:09:46,455 --> 00:09:48,979
This is the third dinner

174
00:09:49,023 --> 00:09:50,546
Wednesday has skipped
this week.

175
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,113
Why is she avoiding us?

176
00:09:52,156 --> 00:09:55,116
All I ever do is try to love
and support her.

177
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:58,467
Gomez, I think she's saying
that's the problem.

178
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:01,513
You're brilliant, cara mia.

179
00:10:01,557 --> 00:10:03,472
-What?
-She's trying to tell me

180
00:10:03,515 --> 00:10:05,692
that what a young girl wants

181
00:10:05,735 --> 00:10:07,607
is a ton of attention
from her father.

182
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,697
Or you could just
keep being yourself.

183
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,395
Let her come back to us
when she's ready.

184
00:10:13,438 --> 00:10:15,353
But that could take forever!

185
00:10:15,397 --> 00:10:19,401
I have the very solution
to the problem, cara mia.

186
00:10:19,444 --> 00:10:20,968
We'll take a family road trip.

187
00:10:21,011 --> 00:10:22,534
What?

188
00:10:22,578 --> 00:10:25,102
You've always wanted to see
more of this great country.

189
00:10:25,146 --> 00:10:26,800
Well, it's true.

190
00:10:26,843 --> 00:10:30,630
We have some of
the best dark secrets,
as countries go.

191
00:10:30,673 --> 00:10:32,022
Then it's settled!

192
00:10:32,066 --> 00:10:35,243
We are going on
an Addams family vacation!

193
00:10:39,203 --> 00:10:40,944
Come on, kids.

194
00:10:40,988 --> 00:10:44,948
Feast your eyes
on the old Addams camper.

195
00:10:44,992 --> 00:10:46,820
Thing's been fixing it up.

196
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:54,871
It's a hybrid.

197
00:10:54,915 --> 00:10:57,482
Half car, half eyesore.

198
00:10:57,526 --> 00:11:00,224
Mother, Father, this is cruel.

199
00:11:00,268 --> 00:11:02,139
Even for you.

200
00:11:03,793 --> 00:11:06,230
-That's the spirit, Lurch.
-

201
00:11:08,145 --> 00:11:10,191
-Ha-ha!

202
00:11:10,234 --> 00:11:11,671
Let's go, Wednesday.

203
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:13,977
It's time
for some family bonding.

204
00:11:14,021 --> 00:11:16,676
Whether you like it or not.

205
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,200
You see, Wednesday,

206
00:11:19,243 --> 00:11:20,854
this trip will bring
the Addams family

207
00:11:20,897 --> 00:11:23,552
closer than ever before.

208
00:11:25,772 --> 00:11:28,383
Or there will be no survivors.

209
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:30,428
Hello?

210
00:11:30,472 --> 00:11:32,126
Anybody home?

211
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:33,214
Hello?

212
00:11:33,257 --> 00:11:34,345
Mr. Addams?

213
00:11:35,303 --> 00:11:37,305
Hello, good sir!

214
00:11:37,348 --> 00:11:38,349
I am Gomez Addams.

215
00:11:39,655 --> 00:11:42,049
And this is my wife, Morticia.

216
00:11:42,092 --> 00:11:43,528
Charmed.

217
00:11:43,572 --> 00:11:45,095
I'll get right to the point.

218
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:46,749
My name is Mustela.

219
00:11:46,793 --> 00:11:50,231
I'm a lawyer
representing a couple
in Sausalito, California.

220
00:11:50,274 --> 00:11:52,015
Recent evidence
has come to light

221
00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:54,670
that on the night of
my client's daughter's birth,

222
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,237
she may have been switched

223
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,456
with another child
at the hospital.

224
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:03,026
Namely, a Wednesday Addams.

225
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,549
-

226
00:12:07,074 --> 00:12:09,119
Ooh, hilarious!

227
00:12:09,163 --> 00:12:13,123
All this, just to get out
of a family road trip.

228
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:15,082
How much did Wednesday
pay you?

229
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,648
Excuse me?

230
00:12:16,692 --> 00:12:19,129
Oh! Sorry, sorry,
where are my manners?

231
00:12:19,173 --> 00:12:21,828
I think he's expecting a tip.

232
00:12:21,871 --> 00:12:24,787
No, I'm expecting
a DNA sample.

233
00:12:24,831 --> 00:12:26,615
If you'll bring
the child here, we can--

234
00:12:26,658 --> 00:12:29,357
I never seem to have a tip.

235
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,750
-I do.

236
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:33,578
Great Uncle Zander left me
these tips in his will.

237
00:12:33,622 --> 00:12:35,711
I knew one day
they'd come in handy.

238
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,844
There you go, my good man.

239
00:12:37,887 --> 00:12:40,411
Well played.
Very amusing indeed.

240
00:12:40,455 --> 00:12:42,370
I assure you, Mr. Addams,

241
00:12:42,413 --> 00:12:45,547
there's nothing amusing
about this.

242
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,942
And this is far from over!

243
00:12:48,985 --> 00:12:51,161
I can't believe
he gave me the finger.

244
00:12:52,423 --> 00:12:55,426
Mother, Father,
who was that man?

245
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,298
Very funny, Wednesday.

246
00:12:57,341 --> 00:12:59,039
Nice try.

247
00:12:59,082 --> 00:13:01,345
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

248
00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:02,956
Who was he?

249
00:13:05,697 --> 00:13:07,351
No one for you
to worry about.

250
00:13:07,395 --> 00:13:08,700
No one at all, dear.

251
00:13:09,614 --> 00:13:10,615
Hmm.

252
00:13:11,921 --> 00:13:13,488
Thank you
for watching the house

253
00:13:13,531 --> 00:13:14,881
while we're gone, Grandma.

254
00:13:14,924 --> 00:13:17,405
It's such a relief
to know it's in safe hands.

255
00:13:17,448 --> 00:13:19,015
Oh, please.

256
00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:22,453
Trust me, these hands
have cracked many safes.

257
00:13:22,497 --> 00:13:25,674
Thing, let the vacation
commence!

258
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:28,590
Let's roll!

259
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:41,472
Bye! Farewell!

260
00:13:41,516 --> 00:13:44,258
Adios!Toodle-oo!

261
00:13:44,301 --> 00:13:46,260
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
I thought they'd never leave.

262
00:13:46,303 --> 00:13:49,219
Let's party!

263
00:13:51,352 --> 00:13:53,049
You read my mind, chuckles.

264
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:54,834
Time to make some money.

265
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:03,581
I thought that first,

266
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:06,236
we shall pay our respects
to the immolated

267
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,369
in the witch-haunted city
of Salem.

268
00:14:08,412 --> 00:14:12,416
Then, in the great
nomadic tradition
of our ancestors,

269
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:16,333
we'll flit hither and thither
across this great nation

270
00:14:16,377 --> 00:14:17,682
until we reach

271
00:14:17,726 --> 00:14:19,815
-our final destination.
-

272
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:23,819
The place on Earth
where people are happiest!

273
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,952
Death Valley!

274
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:28,302
We'll be gone
for three weeks.

275
00:14:28,345 --> 00:14:30,130
Three weeks?

276
00:14:30,173 --> 00:14:32,306
You're both growing up
so fast.

277
00:14:32,349 --> 00:14:33,916
Soon, you'll move out,

278
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,526
and it'll be nice
to have a memory

279
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:36,876
we could look back upon.

280
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:39,574
No matter how terrible.

281
00:14:39,617 --> 00:14:41,271
Ooh, like prom night.

282
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:48,539
'Bout to go global

283
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,935
I can't believe the boss
made me bring backup.

284
00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:54,806
No offense,
I just really don't see

285
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,373
what you bring
to the table.

286
00:14:57,374 --> 00:14:58,985
All I know is,

287
00:14:59,028 --> 00:15:01,509
if we don't get that girl
and bring her back
to Sausalito,

288
00:15:01,552 --> 00:15:02,989
we'll both be fired.

289
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:06,775
Oh, ugh. Mint?

290
00:15:06,818 --> 00:15:08,385
You know what? Take 'em all.

291
00:15:21,442 --> 00:15:23,966
'Bout to go global

292
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:35,935
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
And then it goes...

293
00:15:41,766 --> 00:15:43,943
Anyway, it's not finished yet,

294
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:46,336
but it's my best
rock opera yet.

295
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,773
I'm calling it Rocktapus.

296
00:15:48,817 --> 00:15:50,340
I wrote it in the bath.

297
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:53,169
I've been taking
a lot of baths recently.

298
00:15:53,213 --> 00:15:54,518
You know, I think it's...

299
00:15:58,522 --> 00:16:01,961
All that beautiful water!

300
00:16:03,266 --> 00:16:04,964
Forget Salem!
We know how it turned out.

301
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:06,356
Change of plans.

302
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:26,202
Thing, how did this happen?

303
00:16:26,246 --> 00:16:27,812
We were supposed
to be in Salem.

304
00:16:29,858 --> 00:16:31,816
Ah, don't be mad, brother.

305
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,428
Niagara Falls is
the great Wonder of the World

306
00:16:34,471 --> 00:16:36,952
and kills the most tourists

307
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,868
with its powerful, seductive

308
00:16:44,568 --> 00:16:46,831
Fester? Fester?

309
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,703
Hey, Fester.
-

310
00:16:48,746 --> 00:16:49,965
Are you feeling all right?

311
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,576
You're not your usual
creepy self.

312
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,838
Not especially.

313
00:16:53,882 --> 00:16:55,318
Will you take a look at this?

314
00:16:55,362 --> 00:16:57,320
-Does this seem off to you?
-

315
00:16:57,364 --> 00:16:58,713
It smells okay,

316
00:16:58,756 --> 00:17:00,497
but make sure to put it
in the fridge.

317
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,064
Seafood turns very quickly.

318
00:17:04,501 --> 00:17:06,025
Having fun?

319
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:10,203
I'm staring at Canada,
if that answers
your question.

320
00:17:10,246 --> 00:17:11,943
I'm sorry, Wednesday.

321
00:17:11,987 --> 00:17:13,554
I know how much
you wanted to see

322
00:17:13,597 --> 00:17:16,035
where girls your age
were burned at the stake.

323
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:17,210
What did you call them again?

324
00:17:17,732 --> 00:17:20,126
Squad goals.

325
00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:22,258
What do you say
we do a little exploring?

326
00:17:22,302 --> 00:17:23,346
Just us.

327
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,435
I saw a vintage store
in town.

328
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:28,699
Maybe it's time for you
to try out a more mature look.

329
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,877
The little black dress
is a classic, Mother.

330
00:17:32,921 --> 00:17:34,575
There's my little holy terror.

331
00:17:36,011 --> 00:17:38,361
You know how I feel
about hugs, Father.

332
00:17:42,017 --> 00:17:45,238
Did you know dozens of people
tried to go over these falls

333
00:17:45,281 --> 00:17:46,717
in wooden barrels?

334
00:17:46,761 --> 00:17:48,284
Does anyone survive?

335
00:17:48,328 --> 00:17:50,852
Some do. Some don't.

336
00:17:50,895 --> 00:17:54,682
I hear it's a barrel of fun.

337
00:17:54,725 --> 00:17:56,684
-

338
00:17:56,727 --> 00:18:00,122
Pugsley, have you ever worn
a coat of live bees?

339
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,603
OMG.

340
00:18:02,646 --> 00:18:04,692
I should totes take a selfie
of this moment.

341
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:08,957
Ah! This is
the perfect opportunity

342
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,872
to try out the moves
in my book.

343
00:18:10,915 --> 00:18:12,178
The key with women

344
00:18:12,221 --> 00:18:14,745
is to make a strong
first impression.

345
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:16,312
You mean like a bad smell?

346
00:18:16,356 --> 00:18:17,922
Well, that goes
without saying.

347
00:18:17,966 --> 00:18:21,709
What I mean is,
it's important
to make a big splash.

348
00:18:21,752 --> 00:18:23,276
Are you with me, kid?

349
00:18:26,322 --> 00:18:27,410
-

350
00:18:27,454 --> 00:18:28,629
-Huh?
- Ouch!

351
00:18:28,672 --> 00:18:30,587
I just skinned my knee

352
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:32,459
falling for you.

353
00:18:34,591 --> 00:18:36,593
That's so corny.

354
00:18:36,637 --> 00:18:39,379
Ugh. Did you get that
from a book?

355
00:18:39,422 --> 00:18:40,641
-Uh-oh. Uh...
-

356
00:18:40,684 --> 00:18:42,947
Leave this to me.

357
00:18:42,991 --> 00:18:45,515
Excuse me, vacuous lemmings.

358
00:18:47,822 --> 00:18:49,737
Oh, come on.

359
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,134
-

360
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:01,879
Let me begin

361
00:19:01,923 --> 00:19:04,447
Battle me, that's a sin

362
00:19:04,491 --> 00:19:06,362
Punk, you better back up

363
00:19:06,406 --> 00:19:07,929
And, yo

364
00:19:07,972 --> 00:19:09,365
-

365
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:10,845
I came to get down

366
00:19:10,888 --> 00:19:12,020
And jump around

367
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,283
-

368
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:21,986
And get down!

369
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:26,904
Jump! Jump!

370
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:37,915
Madison,
would you do me the honor
of becoming my wife?

371
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:39,352
-

372
00:19:39,395 --> 00:19:41,789
Help!

373
00:19:41,832 --> 00:19:43,225
Is that a maybe?

374
00:19:51,146 --> 00:19:53,366
-

375
00:20:00,547 --> 00:20:02,897
Right in the Niagara balls!

376
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:09,295
Nobody is renting barrels.

377
00:20:09,338 --> 00:20:12,167
I had to buy 300 pickles
just to get these.

378
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,647
You go that way.
I'll look over here.

379
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:14,561
Gomez, look.

380
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,520
Isn't that the weaselly man

381
00:20:17,564 --> 00:20:19,609
who came to the house
looking for Wednesday?

382
00:20:19,653 --> 00:20:22,786
Well, I have to admit,
I admire the man's tenacity.

383
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,048
Wednesday, let's try

384
00:20:24,092 --> 00:20:26,616
a little family trust-building
exercise.

385
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,879
-I don't believe in exercise.
- Sorry!

386
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:41,109
Excelsior!Whoo-hoo-hoo!

387
00:20:42,719 --> 00:20:44,243
-Hey, hey, wait for me!

388
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:46,245
I wanna go in the water too!

389
00:20:53,991 --> 00:20:56,342
Help! Pongo!

390
00:20:56,385 --> 00:20:58,344
Guess that takes care of that.

391
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,781
Hey, where's Pugsley?

392
00:21:02,217 --> 00:21:04,654
Well, look at this,
a tiny floating person.

393
00:21:04,698 --> 00:21:06,134
-

394
00:21:06,177 --> 00:21:07,614
Oh! There he is.

395
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:13,794
How great was that, Wednesday?

396
00:21:13,837 --> 00:21:15,665
And we both survived.

397
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:17,928
Another thing
we have in common.

398
00:21:17,972 --> 00:21:20,279
Okay, what's going on?

399
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:21,584
Whatever do you mean?

400
00:21:21,628 --> 00:21:22,933
Father.

401
00:21:22,977 --> 00:21:25,458
His erratic behavior.

402
00:21:25,501 --> 00:21:27,808
This last-minute family trip
to make memories.

403
00:21:27,851 --> 00:21:29,288
Giving hugs.

404
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:30,680
It's torture.

405
00:21:30,724 --> 00:21:31,986
And not the fun kind,

406
00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:35,032
like putting leeches
in Pugsley's briefs.

407
00:21:35,076 --> 00:21:37,731
Anyway, I'm quite sure
he's dying.

408
00:21:37,774 --> 00:21:39,341
-What?
-Don't worry.

409
00:21:39,385 --> 00:21:40,777
I won't tell Pugsley.

410
00:21:40,821 --> 00:21:41,952
Not yet.

411
00:21:41,996 --> 00:21:44,085
He'll enjoy the surprise.

412
00:21:44,128 --> 00:21:48,611
But if you're afraid
to ask my permission
to take a new lover,

413
00:21:48,655 --> 00:21:50,221
just know you have it.

414
00:21:50,265 --> 00:21:52,223
-

415
00:21:58,795 --> 00:22:01,494
Dropped out of school

416
00:22:01,537 --> 00:22:04,584
Ouch!
Mom, tell her to stop!

417
00:22:04,627 --> 00:22:06,586
Please,
darlings, quiet down.

418
00:22:06,629 --> 00:22:08,370
I'm trying to find a signal.

419
00:22:09,632 --> 00:22:11,591
-

420
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:13,984
Ow!

421
00:22:14,028 --> 00:22:15,508
-Mom, help!
-

422
00:22:15,551 --> 00:22:17,597
Gomez, have you heard
from your mother yet?

423
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,599
She's not answering my texts.

424
00:22:19,642 --> 00:22:21,775
Oh, she's probably having
an early night.

425
00:22:21,818 --> 00:22:25,779
The woman is almost
102 years old, after all.

426
00:22:25,822 --> 00:22:27,781
-Whoo!

427
00:22:27,824 --> 00:22:29,348
-

428
00:22:32,655 --> 00:22:33,874
Whoo-hoo!

429
00:22:33,917 --> 00:22:35,397
-We're here for the party!

430
00:22:36,006 --> 00:22:37,530
Whoop-la!

431
00:22:37,573 --> 00:22:38,618
Tickets, please!

432
00:22:38,661 --> 00:22:42,099
Wow, this place
is a whole mood.

433
00:22:42,143 --> 00:22:45,538
Well, if you're
in the mood to party,

434
00:22:45,581 --> 00:22:47,409
step right this way.

435
00:22:47,453 --> 00:22:49,977
Whoa!
This plant totes slaps!

436
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:53,023
No, darling, she snaps.

437
00:22:53,067 --> 00:22:54,982
-Oh, don't worry, don't worry.

438
00:22:55,025 --> 00:22:56,984
She's on a vegan diet.

439
00:22:57,027 --> 00:23:00,857
In that she only eats vegans.

440
00:23:00,901 --> 00:23:02,293
And who's the headliner?

441
00:23:02,337 --> 00:23:04,948
Uh... Uh... The Talking Heads.

442
00:23:04,992 --> 00:23:05,949
For reals?

443
00:23:05,993 --> 00:23:07,211
Uh, yeah, yeah.

444
00:23:07,255 --> 00:23:08,648
Uh, they're right over there.

445
00:23:11,477 --> 00:23:13,130
-

446
00:23:13,174 --> 00:23:16,438
On you, ooh, ooh

447
00:23:17,918 --> 00:23:20,007
Um... I didn't pay $500
to watch a bunch of puppets.

448
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,443
What?

449
00:23:21,487 --> 00:23:23,271
Do you know how hard it is
to decapitate

450
00:23:23,314 --> 00:23:24,925
an entire barber shop quartet?

451
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:29,190
Ew! Refund, please.

452
00:23:30,452 --> 00:23:31,888
Let's not be hasty.

453
00:23:31,932 --> 00:23:34,369
I was just joking.

454
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,979
I don't want to ruin
the surprise.

455
00:23:36,023 --> 00:23:37,981
And... And trust me,

456
00:23:38,025 --> 00:23:41,289
the headliner will make
serious headlines.

457
00:23:42,856 --> 00:23:44,510
-

458
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:53,344
It was
the dead of night.

459
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,828
-The witching hour.
-

460
00:23:58,872 --> 00:24:00,439
The wolf howled.

461
00:24:03,746 --> 00:24:06,880
And then she heard
a scratching at the door.

462
00:24:06,923 --> 00:24:08,534
Scratch,

463
00:24:08,577 --> 00:24:10,057
scratch,

464
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,189
scratch.

465
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:15,541
She slowly opened it to reveal

466
00:24:16,106 --> 00:24:17,934
a puppy!

467
00:24:17,978 --> 00:24:20,241
-And around its neck

468
00:24:20,284 --> 00:24:21,503
was a bow!

469
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:25,855
-Mm. Gomez.
-

470
00:24:25,899 --> 00:24:28,510
You remember
when I first told you
that one, Pugsley?

471
00:24:28,554 --> 00:24:30,730
You must've been
two months old.

472
00:24:30,773 --> 00:24:34,342
Oh, you'd scream and scream
until you wet yourself.

473
00:24:34,385 --> 00:24:36,518
Some things never change.

474
00:24:38,564 --> 00:24:40,348
She's not back yet.

475
00:24:40,391 --> 00:24:41,958
She said
she wanted to be alone,

476
00:24:42,002 --> 00:24:44,091
but how long does that take?

477
00:24:44,134 --> 00:24:45,788
-There she is.

478
00:24:45,832 --> 00:24:47,877
How did it go out there,
Wednesday?

479
00:24:47,921 --> 00:24:49,488
Did Kitty do
his business?

480
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:50,489
Indeed.

481
00:24:52,447 --> 00:24:53,970
Ew!
-Come, come. Join us.

482
00:24:54,014 --> 00:24:56,582
We were just telling stories
of when Pugsley was born.

483
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:58,888
He kept us up all night,
howling.

484
00:24:58,932 --> 00:25:00,716
Wednesday,
you were the opposite.

485
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,022
I've never heard of a baby

486
00:25:02,065 --> 00:25:04,328
being completely
silent before.

487
00:25:04,372 --> 00:25:05,721
-Ah, yes,

488
00:25:05,765 --> 00:25:08,115
I remember the night
Wednesday was born.

489
00:25:08,158 --> 00:25:09,725
It was a Tuesday.

490
00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:12,685
All tucked in tight
in the hospital nursery.

491
00:25:12,728 --> 00:25:15,383
She was silent as a jellyfish.

492
00:25:15,426 --> 00:25:18,386
Even when
all the other little babies
started bawling.

493
00:25:18,429 --> 00:25:20,344
What do you mean?

494
00:25:20,388 --> 00:25:22,782
Oh, I never
told you this story?

495
00:25:23,957 --> 00:25:26,699
Start talking.

496
00:25:26,742 --> 00:25:28,352
Well, I was looking
for a bathroom

497
00:25:28,396 --> 00:25:30,964
because I'd eaten all
of the patients' pudding

498
00:25:31,007 --> 00:25:32,879
that they left behind,

499
00:25:32,922 --> 00:25:35,751
when I took a wrong turn
into the hospital nursery.

500
00:25:38,058 --> 00:25:39,886
-

501
00:25:39,929 --> 00:25:41,844
-

502
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,545
And that's when
I spotted her.

503
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,595
I just wanted to get
a better look
at my new niece.

504
00:25:53,639 --> 00:25:55,597
But a bunch
of the babies started

505
00:25:55,641 --> 00:25:57,207
wailing their heads off.

506
00:25:57,251 --> 00:26:01,037
So, I remembered the age-old
Addams family nursery trick.

507
00:26:13,093 --> 00:26:15,356
And sure enough,
they all fell asleep.

508
00:26:17,663 --> 00:26:20,187
And I put all the babies back
where I found them.

509
00:26:21,405 --> 00:26:22,493
I think.

510
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,193
-Pretty sure.
-

511
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:32,416
-Kitty needs a walk.
-Right away.

512
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,504
But I just walked--

513
00:26:33,548 --> 00:26:36,116
Fester,
you're in charge.

514
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,771
I wonder if I could
juggle actual children.

515
00:26:38,814 --> 00:26:41,077
Wednesday, Pugsley,
bring it in, let's find out.

516
00:26:41,121 --> 00:26:43,036
You never know until you try.

517
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:44,254
-And if one of you

518
00:26:44,298 --> 00:26:46,343
falls on your head,
well, lesson learned.

519
00:26:46,387 --> 00:26:49,825
Hard to believe
women don't want
to talk to either of you.

520
00:26:51,697 --> 00:26:54,569
Gomez,
what if what
that lawyer said is true?

521
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,050
These people
are not going to give up.

522
00:26:57,093 --> 00:27:00,053
They'll keep coming
until they take her away.

523
00:27:00,096 --> 00:27:01,315
Let him come!

524
00:27:01,358 --> 00:27:03,970
They shall know us
by our trail of dead.

525
00:27:04,013 --> 00:27:06,886
Ugh.
That's your answer
to everything.

526
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:08,757
I only wish

527
00:27:08,801 --> 00:27:10,890
I did have the answer
for it, querida.

528
00:27:14,894 --> 00:27:17,200
Tish! That's it.

529
00:27:17,244 --> 00:27:20,290
I may not have the answer,
but I know someone who will.

530
00:27:20,334 --> 00:27:21,988
I hope so.

531
00:27:22,031 --> 00:27:24,686
Whatever we do,
we can't let
Wednesday find out

532
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:26,645
she might not be our daughter.

533
00:27:31,998 --> 00:27:33,782
Could it be true?

534
00:27:33,826 --> 00:27:37,830
Could I have been misplaced
in my infancy?

535
00:27:37,873 --> 00:27:41,050
Grown up with a delusion
that I am one person,

536
00:27:41,094 --> 00:27:46,708
when in fact, I am someone
completely different.

537
00:27:46,752 --> 00:27:51,800
Now this is the origin story
an innovator like me deserves.

538
00:27:51,844 --> 00:27:54,934
It would make
a fascinating first chapter
in my memoir.

539
00:27:55,935 --> 00:27:57,023
Can you imagine?

540
00:28:01,984 --> 00:28:03,420
Come on, kids!

541
00:28:03,464 --> 00:28:05,292
Up and Addams!

542
00:28:06,336 --> 00:28:08,948
Thing, head south.

543
00:28:08,991 --> 00:28:12,952
What we need is a little
old-fashioned Addams fun!

544
00:28:12,995 --> 00:28:14,388
Ha-ha!

545
00:28:23,136 --> 00:28:24,920
I got it. Oh!
There we go.

546
00:28:24,964 --> 00:28:25,921
Oh, dude!

547
00:28:27,836 --> 00:28:28,968
Hey, freak!

548
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,840
-Pass it back!
-

549
00:28:32,362 --> 00:28:33,973
I'm not a freak.

550
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:37,411
I'm a force of nature.

551
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:41,415
Some force of nature.

552
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:42,938
-So weak.
-

553
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:48,117
Guys, you see this?

554
00:28:48,161 --> 00:28:49,989
-What's going on? what Is it?
-

555
00:28:57,648 --> 00:28:59,868
'Cause nobody can handle me

556
00:28:59,912 --> 00:29:01,348
Because I'm somethin'
They never seen

557
00:29:03,132 --> 00:29:04,830
I'm in love with myself

558
00:29:04,873 --> 00:29:06,701
When I'm feelin' myself

559
00:29:19,409 --> 00:29:20,846
Oh, my.

560
00:29:20,889 --> 00:29:23,849
It looks like
some unfortunate soul

561
00:29:23,892 --> 00:29:27,591
has dropped a small fortune
in the sand.

562
00:29:35,338 --> 00:29:37,645
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

563
00:29:37,688 --> 00:29:39,081
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

564
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:42,171
-Lame!
-

565
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:45,914
It looks like we need
to go over Chapter 3,

566
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:48,656
"How to be Repulsive
and Impress Girls."

567
00:29:48,699 --> 00:29:49,875
I'll be right back.

568
00:29:49,918 --> 00:29:52,225
I gotta go use the bathroom.

569
00:29:52,268 --> 00:29:54,227
Yeah, yeah, yeah

570
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:56,838
Yeah, yeah, yeah

571
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:00,973
-

572
00:30:10,896 --> 00:30:13,028
Yeah, yeah, yeah

573
00:30:13,072 --> 00:30:14,856
Yeah, yeah, yeah

574
00:30:19,339 --> 00:30:20,166
Shark! Shark!

575
00:30:33,527 --> 00:30:34,920
Run for your lives!

576
00:30:40,055 --> 00:30:42,014
Hyah! See?

577
00:30:42,057 --> 00:30:44,799
Now that's how
you attract attention.

578
00:30:48,716 --> 00:30:51,501
Ah! There he is.

579
00:30:51,545 --> 00:30:54,113
The man we came to see.

580
00:31:06,255 --> 00:31:08,997
Ladies, what do ladies say?

581
00:31:10,738 --> 00:31:12,827
We got your back"

582
00:31:17,223 --> 00:31:19,486
We got your back"

583
00:31:19,529 --> 00:31:22,619
We beat it till we beat it

584
00:31:22,663 --> 00:31:24,839
can give it to us
'Cause you know we need it

585
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,275
It!

586
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:29,496
Good to see you,
my bewhiskered cousin.

587
00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:32,020
-You made it.
-

588
00:31:32,064 --> 00:31:35,110
Mm. It's in Florida
for spring break.

589
00:31:35,154 --> 00:31:37,983
Ghouls Gone Wild, am I right?

590
00:31:38,026 --> 00:31:39,288
He's going to join us
on our trip.

591
00:31:39,332 --> 00:31:40,768
Hold on.

592
00:31:40,811 --> 00:31:42,813
He's coming in the camper?

593
00:31:42,857 --> 00:31:44,685
We're cramped enough as it is.

594
00:31:44,728 --> 00:31:46,687
And he sheds, Morticia.

595
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:48,645
Oh, Fester, he's family.

596
00:31:48,689 --> 00:31:50,517
The more the hairier.

597
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,259
Well, if he's allowed
on the couch, then so am I!

598
00:31:55,348 --> 00:31:57,524
-

599
00:31:59,178 --> 00:32:01,093
-

600
00:32:01,136 --> 00:32:02,355
No, no, no!

601
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:03,834
I said cut the red wire.

602
00:32:06,011 --> 00:32:09,362
I can't believe Taylor Swift
wants to date me.

603
00:32:09,405 --> 00:32:11,103
Me.

604
00:32:11,146 --> 00:32:12,887
Make sure to close the door

605
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:16,586
when you go into outer space.

606
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:21,765
Yes, Beyonce,
I would love to share
my ham with you.

607
00:32:23,419 --> 00:32:25,595
-

608
00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:28,511
Weighed empty

609
00:32:31,645 --> 00:32:34,865
Was a bone to be chewed

610
00:32:34,909 --> 00:32:38,782
Of November came early

611
00:32:43,091 --> 00:32:44,875
-

612
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:47,530
In Wisconsin

613
00:32:49,271 --> 00:32:52,361
It was bigger than most

614
00:32:52,405 --> 00:32:54,059
-

615
00:33:05,505 --> 00:33:08,812
I thought you were a leader

616
00:33:08,856 --> 00:33:11,598
You're only a deleter

617
00:33:23,784 --> 00:33:25,612
-

618
00:33:25,655 --> 00:33:27,614
Morticia, I told you so.

619
00:33:27,657 --> 00:33:29,442
There's hairballs everywhere.

620
00:33:31,574 --> 00:33:34,447
Yeah, and the same
to you, fuzzface.

621
00:33:42,672 --> 00:33:44,457
How could you tell?

622
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:55,424
Did it ever bother you
that you were so different

623
00:33:55,468 --> 00:33:57,339
from the rest of the family?

624
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,648
A rebellious phase?

625
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:08,916
You shaved your entire body
as a teenager?

626
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:16,706
Oh. So that's what changed.

627
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,665
You owned who you were.

628
00:34:21,668 --> 00:34:23,757
That's the problem.

629
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,541
I don't know who I am.

630
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:32,592
- Get over here ASAP.

631
00:34:32,635 --> 00:34:34,855
I went too far this time
and things are getting hairy!

632
00:34:34,898 --> 00:34:36,117
No offense.

633
00:34:44,908 --> 00:34:46,475
-Let's do this!
-

634
00:34:49,174 --> 00:34:50,131
-

635
00:34:53,743 --> 00:34:55,745
It's that lawyer, Gomez.

636
00:34:55,789 --> 00:34:57,182
He's found us again.

637
00:34:57,225 --> 00:34:58,966
He wants what we have.

638
00:34:59,009 --> 00:35:01,316
Well, he won't get her.

639
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,752
-Good, Pugsley.

640
00:35:02,796 --> 00:35:04,537
Right this way.

641
00:35:06,365 --> 00:35:08,323
How about a fun
family travel game?

642
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:09,672
Everyone around the table.

643
00:35:09,716 --> 00:35:10,934
Ugh.

644
00:35:10,978 --> 00:35:12,893
-

645
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:23,904
-

646
00:35:30,867 --> 00:35:32,130
So, what shall we play?

647
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:36,308
How about Punch Buggy?

648
00:35:36,351 --> 00:35:37,744
Punch...

649
00:35:38,788 --> 00:35:40,747
-...buggy.

650
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:47,101
-

651
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:54,978
We need to step on it.

652
00:35:55,022 --> 00:35:56,545
And we'll need a place
to hide.

653
00:35:56,589 --> 00:35:58,634
I have just the place,
querida.

654
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,855
-Thing, turn here.
-

655
00:36:02,725 --> 00:36:03,422
Look out!

656
00:36:25,748 --> 00:36:27,750
You sure this is
the right place, Pop?

657
00:36:27,794 --> 00:36:29,230
Yes, son.

658
00:36:29,274 --> 00:36:32,451
The Alamo.

659
00:36:32,494 --> 00:36:36,281
You can sense
that many lives
were lost here.

660
00:36:36,324 --> 00:36:39,240
Let us take a moment
to pay our respects.

661
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:44,289
-

662
00:36:46,726 --> 00:36:48,510
Okay. Enough respect.

663
00:36:48,554 --> 00:36:49,685
Everyone in!

664
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,652
-

665
00:36:59,695 --> 00:37:02,307
Look at y'all's costumes!

666
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:06,920
You guys are a little early
for the Halloween pageant.

667
00:37:06,963 --> 00:37:11,098
Today, we're on the hunt
for our next
Little Miss Jalapeno Pepper.

668
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:15,233
Hello?
Wednesday!

669
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:16,886
-Wednesday Addams!

670
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:19,672
Are you in there? Hello?

671
00:37:19,715 --> 00:37:22,370
Well, burn my biscuits.

672
00:37:22,414 --> 00:37:24,938
This here's
our little tumbleweed.

673
00:37:24,981 --> 00:37:27,636
And she's a-fixin' to be
the Lone Star

674
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,117
-of this here rodeo!
-What?

675
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,771
Well, in that case,

676
00:37:31,814 --> 00:37:34,730
we better get you
all gussied up, hon.

677
00:37:34,774 --> 00:37:37,907
Father, this will not
end well for you.

678
00:37:39,735 --> 00:37:41,433
Wednesday!
-

679
00:37:41,476 --> 00:37:44,044
-

680
00:37:44,087 --> 00:37:45,785
Gomez, what are you doing?

681
00:37:45,828 --> 00:37:48,440
Just follow my lead.

682
00:37:48,483 --> 00:37:51,138
Howdy. We're oil tycoons.

683
00:37:51,181 --> 00:37:54,010
Oil tycoons? How can I...
Eesh!

684
00:37:54,054 --> 00:37:55,969
We're a-fixin'
to find ourselves

685
00:37:56,012 --> 00:37:59,320
some fancy new Texas threads.

686
00:37:59,364 --> 00:38:01,017
Will this be enough
to cover it?

687
00:38:02,932 --> 00:38:04,717
Mm.
-

688
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,501
-

689
00:38:06,545 --> 00:38:08,111
Yeah! Check it out!

690
00:38:08,155 --> 00:38:10,026
Now just hold still,
sweetie.

691
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,289
Make it tighter.

692
00:38:12,768 --> 00:38:13,900
Hi.

693
00:38:13,943 --> 00:38:15,336
What's your talent?

694
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,512
I can read minds.

695
00:38:17,556 --> 00:38:18,774
No, you can't.

696
00:38:20,167 --> 00:38:22,169
Yes, I can.

697
00:38:22,212 --> 00:38:23,953
This isn't really happening.

698
00:38:23,997 --> 00:38:25,912
It is really happening.

699
00:38:25,955 --> 00:38:27,479
Think of a number.
Uh, number seven.

700
00:38:27,522 --> 00:38:29,089
-Seven.
-

701
00:38:29,132 --> 00:38:30,569
-Uh, purple.
-Purple.

702
00:38:30,612 --> 00:38:31,700
My worst nightmare.

703
00:38:31,744 --> 00:38:33,528
Hippopotamus riding a bicycle.

704
00:38:33,572 --> 00:38:34,921
What's your name?

705
00:38:34,964 --> 00:38:36,966
-Wednesday, what's yours?
-I don't wanna tell you.

706
00:38:38,228 --> 00:38:39,404
Hello, Peggy.

707
00:38:42,058 --> 00:38:43,233
I know.

708
00:38:43,277 --> 00:38:44,800
Just give me
the trophy already.

709
00:39:01,295 --> 00:39:04,080
I look like Uncle Sam
threw up all over me.

710
00:39:04,124 --> 00:39:06,779
Very good, Pugsley.
Blend in.

711
00:39:06,822 --> 00:39:09,042
If you have to interact
with any of the locals,

712
00:39:09,085 --> 00:39:12,872
remember, they're more afraid
of you than you are of them.

713
00:39:16,615 --> 00:39:18,530
-Oh, my word!

714
00:39:24,405 --> 00:39:26,886
These are
the perfect disguises.

715
00:39:26,929 --> 00:39:28,583
It's like we're invisible.

716
00:39:43,946 --> 00:39:45,470
We're dead, Gomez.

717
00:39:48,951 --> 00:39:51,693
-

718
00:39:51,737 --> 00:39:55,262
On my face?

719
00:39:58,961 --> 00:40:02,835
In the show tonight

720
00:40:02,878 --> 00:40:06,708
Really look so good?

721
00:40:08,188 --> 00:40:10,320
You think I should?

722
00:40:10,364 --> 00:40:14,063
If I blew a kiss?

723
00:40:14,107 --> 00:40:17,763
In the show tonight

724
00:40:21,201 --> 00:40:25,858
Ah. The only girls I see here
are perfectly normal.

725
00:40:25,901 --> 00:40:29,731
Is getting nearer

726
00:40:33,648 --> 00:40:37,391
In the mirror

727
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:40,655
-Ugh!
-

728
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:44,964
-

729
00:40:45,007 --> 00:40:48,446
Like I did a week ago

730
00:40:52,188 --> 00:40:54,495
In the show tonight

Hear, hear! Bella!

733
00:41:12,948 --> 00:41:14,254
There she is!

734
00:41:15,995 --> 00:41:17,736
Hey, y'all!

735
00:41:17,779 --> 00:41:21,391
That man right there
is one of the top
talent agents in the world!

736
00:41:25,395 --> 00:41:26,962
What?
-

737
00:41:30,966 --> 00:41:37,625
You rang?

738
00:41:39,018 --> 00:41:40,323
Quick, Lurch.

739
00:41:40,367 --> 00:41:41,977
-Grab Wednesday.

740
00:42:02,781 --> 00:42:03,912

Hello. Hi.

744
00:42:15,445 --> 00:42:17,752
I'll find you,
Wednesday Addams!

745
00:42:23,932 --> 00:42:27,588
You have traumatized me
beyond all recognition.

746
00:42:27,632 --> 00:42:29,198
She looks the same to me.

747
00:42:29,242 --> 00:42:31,070
Who is that man?

748
00:42:31,113 --> 00:42:33,028
I know he's not
a talent agent.

749
00:42:33,072 --> 00:42:35,553
He's the same man
who came to the house.

750
00:42:39,339 --> 00:42:41,907
You're far too clever for us
to pull the wool
over your eyes.

751
00:42:43,038 --> 00:42:44,605
That man

752
00:42:44,649 --> 00:42:47,434
-is a door-to-door salesman.
-Gomez.

753
00:42:47,477 --> 00:42:49,349
And what is he selling?

754
00:42:49,392 --> 00:42:51,351
Uh... Tupperware?

755
00:42:51,394 --> 00:42:53,179
Knives? Makeup.

756
00:42:53,222 --> 00:42:55,007
Uh... Uh, frozen steaks.

757
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:57,357
Life insurance for cows.

758
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,576
Uh, they need it.

759
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:01,361
The steak industry
is, oh, brutal.

760
00:43:02,928 --> 00:43:04,407
Okay.

761
00:43:04,451 --> 00:43:06,627
If that's the way
you want to play it.

762
00:43:06,671 --> 00:43:08,977
I'm going to go give
Pugsley a haircut.

763
00:43:09,021 --> 00:43:10,283
I think he's taking a nap.

764
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,590
Exactly.

765
00:43:13,808 --> 00:43:14,722
That was easy.

766
00:43:25,124 --> 00:43:29,563

Every time

768
00:43:36,657 --> 00:43:39,529
I'm not sure
Wednesday believed us.

769
00:43:39,573 --> 00:43:42,184
I'm sure she would have said
something if she didn't.

770
00:43:42,228 --> 00:43:45,144
If there's one thing
we can count on Wednesday for,
it's honesty.

771
00:43:45,187 --> 00:43:48,103
She certainly lets me know
when I'm embarrassing her

772

773
00:43:49,409 --> 00:43:51,585

in the laundry?

775
00:43:57,330 --> 00:44:00,463
They need to be lost
in order to be found?

776
00:44:00,507 --> 00:44:01,856
That's brilliant!

777
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,162
Yes.

778
00:44:03,205 --> 00:44:05,730
We should find a place,
lie low for a while,

779
00:44:05,773 --> 00:44:08,907
and this whole thing
will just blow over.

780

Lurch, old boy, top it off.

781
00:44:10,909 --> 00:44:12,824
We have places to be.

Where's Kitty?
He needs a walk.

783
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:48,424
He's asleep.

Uh-oh.

Yeah, I finally
got off diapers,

790
00:45:03,135 --> 00:45:04,745

-Pardon me.

793
00:45:08,575 --> 00:45:11,491
Gomez,
have you noticed changes

794
00:45:11,534 --> 00:45:13,754
in Fester's body lately?

795
00:45:13,798 --> 00:45:15,756
Hmm. Puberty?

Oh!

797
00:45:30,205 --> 00:45:31,729
Huh?

00:45:33,208 --> 00:45:34,514
Ow!

This doesn't look
so grand to me.

803
00:45:53,228 --> 00:45:55,796
The sheer emptiness.

to leave us so soon, cousin?

No.

would you do me the honor--

Now, that's grand.

What is this all about?

856

It's about you, Wednesday.

857
00:49:57,124 --> 00:49:59,909
My wife and I were separated
from our true daughter

858
00:49:59,953 --> 00:50:02,042
on the night of her birth.

859
00:50:02,086 --> 00:50:04,697
I never gave up
trying to find her.

860
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:07,091
I searched and searched
for years,

861
00:50:07,134 --> 00:50:10,050
and then, suddenly,
there I was,

862
00:50:10,094 --> 00:50:12,313
standing on that stage.

863
00:50:12,357 --> 00:50:14,011
Looking right at you.

864
00:50:14,924 --> 00:50:16,317
In that moment,

865
00:50:16,361 --> 00:50:20,539
I knew that you were
my long lost child.

00:50:20,582 --> 00:50:22,062
The physical similarities.

867
00:50:22,106 --> 00:50:25,022
The brilliant scientific mind.

868
00:50:25,065 --> 00:50:27,241
I did some digging.

869
00:50:27,285 --> 00:50:29,330
You were born
at the same hospital,

870
00:50:29,374 --> 00:50:31,985
the same day
as the girl we've raised.

871
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:34,640
And as if meant to be,

872
00:50:34,683 --> 00:50:36,903
your name, Wednesday,

873
00:50:36,946 --> 00:50:39,297
is from my favorite poem.

874
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:40,907
"Wednesday's child is..."

875
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:43,127
"Full of woe."

876
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:45,303
I was named after that poem.

877
00:50:45,346 --> 00:50:47,870
I live by it.

to my home in Sausalito?

Not so fast.

882
00:50:56,662 --> 00:50:59,839
I have further research to
conduct to verify your claim.

883
00:50:59,882 --> 00:51:01,362
Of course.

884
00:51:01,406 --> 00:51:03,538
I would expect nothing less.

885
00:51:03,582 --> 00:51:05,975
By the way, what did you do
with Mr. Mustela?

886
00:51:06,585 --> 00:51:07,760
Oh.

887
00:51:07,803 --> 00:51:09,109
-I let him go.

Tish. You minx.

889
00:52:05,644 --> 00:52:07,124
Let's settle this.

890
00:52:45,074 --> 00:52:47,381
It's all true.

891
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:53,648
The facts before me prove
beyond a reasonable doubt

892
00:52:53,692 --> 00:52:56,303
that I am not an Addams.

893
00:52:56,347 --> 00:52:59,654
That means there's
only one logical choice.

894
00:52:59,698 --> 00:53:01,265
Don't you agree?

895
00:53:08,533 --> 00:53:09,577
Wednesday, dear.

896
00:53:11,753 --> 00:53:13,581
Come along, sleepyhead.

897
00:53:17,498 --> 00:53:19,370
Why, it's easier
to wake the dead

898
00:53:19,413 --> 00:53:20,936
than to wake you, my little...

899
00:53:22,068 --> 00:53:23,243
Hi, Mom.

900

"Dear Addams family,

901

has been off-base lately.

904
00:53:32,948 --> 00:53:34,950
and questioning
the reason for this,

905

but a new revelation has
resolved this doubt for me.

into harmony.

And the reason I could never
truly relate to any of you

910
00:53:47,789 --> 00:53:49,878
is simple.

and make my way
toward the truth.

914
00:54:01,803 --> 00:54:03,805
Do not attempt to follow me."

915
00:54:08,288 --> 00:54:09,333
Wait.

916
00:54:09,376 --> 00:54:11,335
Wednesday's not an Addams?

917
00:54:11,378 --> 00:54:13,902
I'm the only real
Addams child?

918
00:54:13,946 --> 00:54:15,339
That's awesome!

919
00:54:15,382 --> 00:54:18,559
Too soon, Pugsley.
Too soon.

920
00:54:18,603 --> 00:54:20,082
-What does she mean,

921
00:54:20,126 --> 00:54:21,475
"making her way
toward the truth"?

922
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:23,521
Is this about
the hospital thing

923
00:54:23,564 --> 00:54:25,349
that was totally
not a big deal?

924
00:54:25,392 --> 00:54:27,568
-This is all my fault.
-

925
00:54:27,612 --> 00:54:30,267
If she had
just felt closer to me,

926
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:32,094
maybe this wouldn't
have happened.

927
00:54:32,138 --> 00:54:34,140
Thing! I need a Bloody Mary.

928
00:54:34,183 --> 00:54:35,359
Make it a double.

929
00:54:35,402 --> 00:54:36,795
He's in the shower.

930
00:54:39,798 --> 00:54:42,191
Don't forget to clean
behind your knuckles.

931
00:55:02,081 --> 00:55:04,910
Lurch, I can see you.

932
00:55:06,781 --> 00:55:09,131
Obviously,
I have failed in my duty

933
00:55:09,175 --> 00:55:11,046
as your lurking advisor.

934
00:55:13,875 --> 00:55:17,183
I really don't know
how to answer that.

935
00:55:17,226 --> 00:55:21,579
But what I do know is
that you should go back
to your family.

936
00:55:21,622 --> 00:55:24,582
It's time for me to find mine.

937
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:28,977
I guess that's true.

938
00:55:29,021 --> 00:55:31,850
You're not an Addams either.

939
00:55:31,893 --> 00:55:34,200
How very sad that is.

940
00:55:35,984 --> 00:55:37,812
Much better, Lurch.

941
00:55:37,856 --> 00:55:40,162
It appears I taught you well,
after all.

942
00:55:42,904 --> 00:55:45,254
Like the Donner party
before us,

943
00:55:45,298 --> 00:55:49,302
we travel to California
to fulfil our destiny

944
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:52,784
and eat what we must
along the way.

945
00:55:52,827 --> 00:55:56,962
Let us conquer the Golden West
or die trying.

946
00:55:57,005 --> 00:55:58,746
Lurch,

947
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:00,531
-to Sausalito!
-

948
00:56:00,574 --> 00:56:02,837
Thing, to Sausalito!

949
00:56:02,881 --> 00:56:04,839
If we leave now,
we can catch up.

950
00:56:04,883 --> 00:56:07,668
Then we'll return home,
kidnap the necessary witnesses

951
00:56:07,712 --> 00:56:09,583
and snuff out
any remaining doubt

952
00:56:09,627 --> 00:56:11,368
that Wednesday is one of us.

953
00:56:11,411 --> 00:56:13,021
I love it when

954
00:56:13,065 --> 00:56:16,677
your murderous
maternal instincts kick in!

955
00:56:16,721 --> 00:56:19,027
We're back
in the parenting business!

956
00:56:19,071 --> 00:56:20,725
Come along, Addams.

957
00:56:20,768 --> 00:56:22,770
Let's bring Wednesday
back to her family.

958
00:56:26,861 --> 00:56:32,040
Ahem. Fester, your tentacles
are hanging out.

959
00:56:32,084 --> 00:56:33,999
I thought I felt a draft.

960
00:56:34,042 --> 00:56:35,435
Just don't kick 'em.

961
00:56:35,479 --> 00:56:36,871
They're very sensitive.

962
00:57:09,556 --> 00:57:12,472
All of those
do sound like great options,

963
00:57:12,516 --> 00:57:15,301
but which one
is the road to Sausalito?

964
00:57:33,798 --> 00:57:36,322
It's all the same to me

965
00:57:36,365 --> 00:57:38,280
-Out of my way, Hightower!

966
00:57:45,331 --> 00:57:46,811
Look, Lurch.

967
00:57:46,854 --> 00:57:50,815
Aggressive people who use
loud noises and fast rides

968
00:57:50,858 --> 00:57:53,948
to distract themselves
from their childhood trauma.

969
00:57:53,992 --> 00:57:55,472
Just what we need.

970
00:58:02,783 --> 00:58:05,960
The Ace of Spades

971
00:58:06,004 --> 00:58:07,353
-

972
00:58:15,404 --> 00:58:17,276
- Hmm.

973
00:58:17,885 --> 00:58:18,625
Huh?

974
00:58:27,982 --> 00:58:29,636
Hey!

975
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:33,335
Ain't you the guy that almost
ran my bike off the road?

976
00:58:34,423 --> 00:58:36,904
And you must be Miss Lurleen?

977
00:58:40,778 --> 00:58:42,214
Excuse me?

978
00:58:43,607 --> 00:58:47,567
Ah. It seems I have offended
two people at once.

979
00:58:47,611 --> 00:58:48,699
How fortuitous.

980
00:58:49,787 --> 00:58:51,310
Huh?
-

981
00:58:51,353 --> 00:58:53,355
That was an insult too!

982
00:58:53,399 --> 00:58:55,880
-

983
00:58:55,923 --> 00:58:59,579
I'm afraid you gentlemen
have made a grave error.

984
00:58:59,623 --> 00:59:02,060
Lurch, show these cretins

985
00:59:02,103 --> 00:59:05,585
what your cold,
dead hands are capable of.

986
00:59:05,629 --> 00:59:07,631
Mm-hmm.

987
00:59:22,689 --> 00:59:26,432
Live without you by my side

988
00:59:26,475 --> 00:59:28,260
I should've been
more specific.

989
00:59:28,303 --> 00:59:29,478
But then
I spent so many nights

990
00:59:29,522 --> 00:59:30,871
How you did me wrong

991
00:59:32,786 --> 00:59:35,789
How to get along

992
00:59:39,663 --> 00:59:41,534
-

993
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:43,841
-

994
00:59:43,884 --> 00:59:46,017
To find you here

995
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:48,106
Upon your face

996
00:59:48,149 --> 00:59:49,890
That stupid lock

997
00:59:49,934 --> 00:59:52,632
Leave your key

998
00:59:52,676 --> 00:59:54,460
For just one second

999
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:03,643
Welcome anymore

1000
01:00:05,471 --> 01:00:08,692
To hurt me with goodbye?

1001
01:00:10,868 --> 01:00:12,565
I'd lay down and die?

1002
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:19,485
How to love

1003
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:25,012
I've got all my love to give

1004
01:00:25,056 --> 01:00:28,276
I will survive

1005
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:31,279
All I wanted
was a violent roadhouse melee

1006
01:00:31,323 --> 01:00:33,891
before hitching
a ride to Sausalito.

1007
01:00:33,934 --> 01:00:35,632
Was that too much to ask?

1008
01:00:36,067 --> 01:00:37,459
Sausalito?

1009
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:39,331
That's exactly
where we're headed.

1010
01:00:39,374 --> 01:00:42,029
It's the annual
Hug-A-Biker retreat

1011
01:00:42,073 --> 01:00:44,597
where we deal
with our childhood trauma.

1012
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,512
I am good.

1013
01:00:46,555 --> 01:00:49,297
Bring it in, little lady.

1014
01:00:49,341 --> 01:00:51,038
I accept your offer of a ride.

1015
01:00:51,082 --> 01:00:52,518
But if you don't mind,

1016
01:00:52,561 --> 01:00:55,129
I will respectfully
decline the hug.

1017
01:00:55,173 --> 01:00:57,697
I've been
social distancing
since birth.

1018
01:01:01,962 --> 01:01:04,573
How to love

1019
01:01:06,227 --> 01:01:08,273
All my life to live

1020
01:01:08,316 --> 01:01:11,929
And I'll survive

1021
01:01:34,908 --> 01:01:37,084
I know how to love...

1022
01:01:37,128 --> 01:01:38,825
Sayonara,little lady.

1023
01:01:40,087 --> 01:01:41,828
Whoo-hoo!

1024
01:01:52,796 --> 01:01:55,189
It's all Jekyll, no Hyde.

1025
01:01:59,541 --> 01:02:02,153
I feel something, Lurch.

1026
01:02:02,196 --> 01:02:04,982
As though anticipation
and unease

1027
01:02:05,025 --> 01:02:08,768
birthed some kind of
winged larvae in my stomach.

1028
01:02:10,378 --> 01:02:12,990
Butterflies? Hmm.

1029
01:02:13,033 --> 01:02:15,601
Perhaps my digestive acids
will kill them.

1030
01:02:17,559 --> 01:02:19,736
Wednesday! You're here!

1031
01:02:19,779 --> 01:02:21,694
Welcome home.

1032
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:24,566
Oh. I see you brought
a plus-one.

1033
01:02:27,395 --> 01:02:28,701
fine. Perfectly fine.

1034
01:02:32,183 --> 01:02:33,140
Right this way.

1035
01:02:37,362 --> 01:02:38,842
-

1036
01:02:40,321 --> 01:02:42,410
Wednesday, meet my wife.

1037
01:02:44,195 --> 01:02:47,111
Uh, Ingrid has a touch
of laryngitis

1038
01:02:47,154 --> 01:02:48,634
and finds it difficult to talk
at the moment.

1039
01:02:48,677 --> 01:02:50,244
Hello.

1040
01:02:50,288 --> 01:02:52,769
And this is Ophelia.

1041
01:02:52,812 --> 01:02:55,772
Or as we call her,
our little Oaf.

1042
01:02:56,642 --> 01:02:57,686
The other...

1043
01:02:58,209 --> 01:02:59,384
...me.

1044
01:03:00,689 --> 01:03:01,821
-Oh.

1045
01:03:01,865 --> 01:03:03,867
Uh, Ingrid, my dear,

1046
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:06,043
why don't you rest for a while

1047
01:03:06,086 --> 01:03:08,654
and I'll show
our little Wednesday around.

1048
01:03:08,697 --> 01:03:10,525
Let's go see the laboratory.

1049
01:03:10,569 --> 01:03:12,571
-Don't look at them.

1050
01:03:14,486 --> 01:03:16,096
Right this way.

1051
01:03:22,755 --> 01:03:24,844
Welcome to the future,
Wednesday.

1052
01:03:26,454 --> 01:03:28,456
What do you think?

1053
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:31,242
Pretty boss, huh?

1054
01:03:31,285 --> 01:03:32,809
You've got a lot
of projects in the works.

1055
01:03:34,636 --> 01:03:35,942
Ready, Wednesday?

1056
01:03:39,903 --> 01:03:42,035
When I did this DNA test
with Ophelia

1057
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:44,385
and it informed me
that she wasn't my daughter,

1058
01:03:44,429 --> 01:03:46,561
I was unsurprised.

1059
01:03:46,605 --> 01:03:49,477
Perhaps you can
relate to me on that.

1060
01:03:49,521 --> 01:03:51,305
You see what I did there?

1061
01:03:51,349 --> 01:03:52,872
I did,

1062
01:03:52,916 --> 01:03:55,092
though I generally find puns
to be a lower form of humor.

1063
01:03:55,527 --> 01:03:56,789
Hmm.

1064
01:03:56,833 --> 01:04:00,271
My real passion
has always been...

1065
01:04:01,272 --> 01:04:03,230
human behavior.

1066
01:04:04,971 --> 01:04:07,887
What an incredible
coincidence.

1067
01:04:07,931 --> 01:04:11,282
Exactly my thought when I saw
your winning experiment.

1068
01:04:11,325 --> 01:04:13,632
Although,
if you think about it,

1069
01:04:13,675 --> 01:04:15,939
not so coincidental.

1070
01:04:15,982 --> 01:04:18,506
Like father, like daughter.
Am I right?

1071
01:04:20,987 --> 01:04:23,250
We will find out shortly.

1072
01:04:23,294 --> 01:04:26,558
And when we receive
the inevitable confirmation,

1073
01:04:26,601 --> 01:04:29,691
I hope you'll reconsider
what you told me
at the fair.

1074
01:04:29,735 --> 01:04:31,606
About how your formula

1075
01:04:31,650 --> 01:04:34,087
-was a family secret.
-

1076
01:04:34,131 --> 01:04:36,350
DNA sequencing complete.

1077
01:04:37,699 --> 01:04:40,137
DNA match.

1078
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:42,443
Well, it's all settled.

1079
01:04:42,487 --> 01:04:43,531
Done and...

1080
01:04:45,577 --> 01:04:47,535
-Great.

1081
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:49,320
It's my fa... Uh...

1082
01:04:50,234 --> 01:04:51,975
The Addams family.

1083
01:04:52,018 --> 01:04:54,803
Well, let's go greet them.

1084
01:04:58,807 --> 01:05:00,679
You guys go ahead, I...

1085
01:05:01,593 --> 01:05:03,508
I'm gonna be going in, uh...

1086
01:05:04,161 --> 01:05:06,163
I may be some time.

1087
01:05:06,206 --> 01:05:07,686
-

1088
01:05:17,565 --> 01:05:19,872
You

1089
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:23,093
rang?

1090
01:05:23,136 --> 01:05:25,312
-Lurch.
-We're here
to rescue Wednesday.

1091
01:05:25,356 --> 01:05:26,792
Rescue me from what?

1092
01:05:28,837 --> 01:05:30,230
You!

1093
01:05:30,274 --> 01:05:32,929
Cyrus Strange.
Pleased to meet you.

1094
01:05:32,972 --> 01:05:35,366
You're the man
from the science fair.

1095
01:05:35,409 --> 01:05:37,107
The ghostly apparition.

1096
01:05:38,717 --> 01:05:40,545
Huh.

1097
01:05:40,588 --> 01:05:42,764
I see you've been reanimated.

1098
01:05:42,808 --> 01:05:44,984
And now, you've absconded
with our daughter

1099
01:05:45,028 --> 01:05:46,812
and put her in this...
In...

1100
01:05:46,855 --> 01:05:48,770
Wednesday,
what are you wearing?

1101
01:05:48,814 --> 01:05:50,772
It's called a turtleneck.

1102
01:05:50,816 --> 01:05:52,644
Deceptive name, I know,

1103
01:05:52,687 --> 01:05:55,777
but it is both fashionable
and functional, M...

1104
01:05:56,648 --> 01:05:58,476
Um, Morticia.

1105
01:05:58,519 --> 01:06:01,087
- Mr. and Mrs. Addams,

1106
01:06:01,131 --> 01:06:03,785
it appears
that you are not
Wednesday's parents.

1107
01:06:03,829 --> 01:06:05,004
I am.

1108
01:06:05,048 --> 01:06:07,006
Enough, you knave!

1109
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:10,618
Mr. Addams,
before you do anything rash,

1110
01:06:10,662 --> 01:06:13,012
you might want to see this.

1111
01:06:13,056 --> 01:06:16,015
The results conclusively prove

1112
01:06:16,059 --> 01:06:19,018
that I am not your daughter.

1113
01:06:20,063 --> 01:06:21,847
Where once I was Addams,

1114
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:23,892
now I am Strange.

1115
01:06:24,763 --> 01:06:26,069
Zip it, Pugsley.

1116
01:06:26,112 --> 01:06:27,592
This can't be true.

1117
01:06:27,635 --> 01:06:30,290
I know this must be
quite a shock for you,

1118
01:06:30,334 --> 01:06:31,378
Mr. and Mrs. Addams.

1119
01:06:31,422 --> 01:06:32,684
Believe me,

1120
01:06:32,727 --> 01:06:36,079
we went through
the same thing with Ophelia.

1121
01:06:42,259 --> 01:06:43,260
Wow!

1122
01:06:48,221 --> 01:06:51,659
Wednesday,
we're still your family.

1123
01:06:51,703 --> 01:06:53,835
And that's why
I'd like to honor

1124
01:06:53,879 --> 01:06:56,229
your contributions to my life

1125
01:06:56,273 --> 01:06:59,928
with a proper
and respectful goodbye.

1126
01:07:01,365 --> 01:07:03,671
Uh, Addams family, I...

1127
01:07:03,715 --> 01:07:05,369
I want to say...

1128
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:11,592
It appears
I'm not quite ready
to part with them.

1129
01:07:11,636 --> 01:07:13,072
Forgive me, Father.

1130
01:07:13,116 --> 01:07:15,205
I do forgive you.

1131
01:07:15,248 --> 01:07:17,033
Oh, no.

1132
01:07:17,076 --> 01:07:18,773
I meant Cyrus.

1133
01:07:18,817 --> 01:07:21,037
Come on, Wednesday.
You don't mean this.

1134
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:22,125
Let's just go home.

1135
01:07:22,168 --> 01:07:23,865
We can talk about this
in the camper.

1136
01:07:23,909 --> 01:07:26,085
I'm sorry, Mr. Addams.

1137
01:07:26,129 --> 01:07:28,566
I can't leave with you.

1138
01:07:28,609 --> 01:07:31,003
But maybe we can offer you

1139
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:33,527
and Mrs. Addams shelter
for the night?

1140
01:07:33,571 --> 01:07:36,226
Then tomorrow
we can say goodbye.

1141
01:07:36,269 --> 01:07:38,315
Of course, daughter.

1142
01:07:38,358 --> 01:07:40,317
My man will show you
to the guest quarters.

1143
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:57,334
Of our house

1144
01:08:04,036 --> 01:08:05,646
Something isn't right.

1145
01:08:05,690 --> 01:08:07,170
Of course it's not.

1146
01:08:07,213 --> 01:08:09,433
I've loved Wednesday
her whole life.

1147
01:08:09,476 --> 01:08:11,652
I can't just stop because
a piece of paper says...

1148
01:08:14,742 --> 01:08:15,874
Says...

1149
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:24,883
Wow. They really did
a lot in six hours.

1150
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,936
Oh, Tish.

1151
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:37,156
We've lost our little girl.

1152
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:41,726
Like happy people

1153
01:08:45,033 --> 01:08:46,731
Hey!
-Wha...

1154
01:08:58,873 --> 01:09:01,137
I thought my bedroom
was a mess.

1155
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:03,574
This is awesome!

1156
01:09:03,617 --> 01:09:05,445
Hey, uh, are you hungry?

1157
01:09:05,489 --> 01:09:06,968
I'm always hungry.

1158
01:09:07,012 --> 01:09:08,405
Check it out.

1159
01:09:12,452 --> 01:09:14,019
When my dad's not around,

1160
01:09:14,062 --> 01:09:16,413
I don't use forks
or spoons

1161
01:09:16,978 --> 01:09:18,415
or anything.

1162
01:09:18,458 --> 01:09:19,851
Me either!

1163
01:09:26,727 --> 01:09:28,990
It's a lot easier
to just use your face!

1164
01:09:32,124 --> 01:09:33,778
Where have you been
all my life?

1165
01:09:33,821 --> 01:09:35,345
The farm.

1166
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:37,608
Wait, what did you say?

1167
01:09:41,916 --> 01:09:45,137
Cyrus Strange is lying.
I'm sure of it.

1168
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:46,486
But how do we prove it
to Wednesday that...

1169
01:09:46,530 --> 01:09:48,227
Oh, querida.

1170
01:09:48,271 --> 01:09:49,620
It's no use.

1171
01:09:49,663 --> 01:09:51,056
Wednesday has gone.

1172
01:09:51,099 --> 01:09:54,146
And now, we must do our duty.

1173
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:56,366
We shall raise
the pig girl and...

1174
01:09:56,409 --> 01:09:58,063
Pull yourself together,
Gomez.

1175
01:09:58,106 --> 01:09:59,586
You're an Addams.

1176
01:09:59,630 --> 01:10:01,371
Just as Wednesday is.

1177
01:10:01,414 --> 01:10:03,808
Whether it's in her blood
or not.

1178
01:10:03,851 --> 01:10:05,723
- Mom. Pop.

1179
01:10:05,766 --> 01:10:07,638
You have to see this!

1180
01:10:10,902 --> 01:10:12,730
-

1181
01:10:12,773 --> 01:10:14,471
What happened to these people?

1182
01:10:14,514 --> 01:10:15,689
That's just it!

1183
01:10:15,733 --> 01:10:17,387
I... I don't think
they are people.

1184
01:10:17,430 --> 01:10:19,127
Your idiot boy
is right.

1185
01:10:21,608 --> 01:10:24,481
They're animals
I imbued with human traits.

1186
01:10:24,524 --> 01:10:26,787
Pretty neat, huh?

1187
01:10:26,831 --> 01:10:30,443
They always revert back to
their original form, though.

1188
01:10:30,487 --> 01:10:32,489
So that's why
you wanted Wednesday.

1189
01:10:32,532 --> 01:10:35,709
Her experiment
did what you couldn't.

1190
01:10:35,753 --> 01:10:38,973
Men. Just can't come out
and ask a woman for help,
can you?

1191
01:10:39,017 --> 01:10:40,540
You faked that DNA test.

1192
01:10:40,584 --> 01:10:42,412
Blah, blah, blah, blah!

1193
01:10:42,455 --> 01:10:44,762
Oh, pipe down, Elvira!

1194
01:10:44,805 --> 01:10:48,200
That's it! Prepare to meet
Old Deuteronomy!

1195
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:49,897
Mazurka!

1196
01:11:00,386 --> 01:11:02,301
Oh, where are my manners?

1197
01:11:02,345 --> 01:11:04,738
I forgot to thank you
for the tip!

1198
01:11:04,782 --> 01:11:06,871
-

1199
01:11:08,394 --> 01:11:10,440
I'm good! I'm so good!

1200
01:11:28,109 --> 01:11:29,459
So sorry about that.

1201
01:11:29,502 --> 01:11:30,938
Where were we?

1202
01:11:30,982 --> 01:11:32,679
I have a surprise for you,
Father.

1203
01:11:34,899 --> 01:11:36,944
Yes. Yes! Of course!

1204
01:11:39,991 --> 01:11:42,123
But... But could it work?

1205
01:11:48,391 --> 01:11:50,044
You did it!

1206
01:11:50,088 --> 01:11:53,309
I knew funding those
science fairs would pay off.

1207
01:11:53,352 --> 01:11:54,832
What was that?

1208
01:11:54,875 --> 01:11:56,529
Uh... Nothing.

1209
01:11:56,573 --> 01:12:00,316
I have a surprise for you
as well, Wednesday.

1210
01:12:04,755 --> 01:12:08,019
They can be
our first test subjects.

1211
01:12:08,062 --> 01:12:09,890
What have you done?

1212
01:12:09,934 --> 01:12:11,544
I've got all manner

1213
01:12:11,588 --> 01:12:14,460
of diabolical DNA
in these test tubes.

1214
01:12:14,504 --> 01:12:16,767
You can isolate
the Addams' annoying habits

1215
01:12:16,810 --> 01:12:19,726
and we'll replace them
with ones you want.

1216
01:12:19,770 --> 01:12:21,511
But why?

1217
01:12:21,554 --> 01:12:24,209
I saw you trying
to delay their departure.

1218
01:12:24,252 --> 01:12:27,255
This way,
you can keep them around.

1219
01:12:27,299 --> 01:12:29,170
I need my little protege
to be happy

1220
01:12:29,214 --> 01:12:31,216
and focused on her work.

1221
01:12:31,259 --> 01:12:33,740
This is important stuff
we are doing, Wednesday.

1222
01:12:34,915 --> 01:12:37,048
World-changing!

1223
01:12:37,091 --> 01:12:38,528
"World-changing"?

1224
01:12:38,571 --> 01:12:40,312
If you could control people,

1225
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:43,750
Imbue them
with the strength and ferocity
of any animal on earth?

1226
01:12:43,794 --> 01:12:46,013
Imagine who would pay
for that!

1227
01:12:46,057 --> 01:12:48,451
The military,
foreign governments,

1228
01:12:48,494 --> 01:12:50,104
call centers.

1229
01:12:50,148 --> 01:12:52,803
They'd all want unstoppable
hybrid murder machines

1230
01:12:52,846 --> 01:12:55,371
programmed down
to the cellular level!

1231
01:12:55,414 --> 01:12:59,287
Imagine how rich
and famous we'll become!

1232
01:12:59,331 --> 01:13:03,553
All thanks to your experiment!

1233
01:13:03,596 --> 01:13:05,424
But I only meant to show

1234
01:13:05,468 --> 01:13:08,035
how my Uncle Fester's
intellect could be improved.

1235
01:13:08,079 --> 01:13:11,865
And now you get to improve
the rest of your ex-family.

1236
01:13:14,868 --> 01:13:16,043
But they
don't need improving.

1237
01:13:16,087 --> 01:13:18,263
They're fine as they are.

1238
01:13:19,307 --> 01:13:21,353
Except for maybe Pugsley.

1239
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:24,748
But I'm the one who was
looking for change,

1240
01:13:24,791 --> 01:13:26,140
not them.

1241
01:13:26,184 --> 01:13:27,925
But this way, you'll never
have to feel different

1242
01:13:27,968 --> 01:13:31,058
from anyone in your family
ever again, little boo-boo.

1243
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:45,246
Here you are, Wednesday.

1244
01:13:45,290 --> 01:13:47,205
You do the honors.

1245
01:13:49,816 --> 01:13:51,731
I won't!

1246
01:13:51,775 --> 01:13:54,560
Even though you are
biologically my father,

1247
01:13:54,604 --> 01:13:58,042
these people
are still my family.

1248
01:13:58,085 --> 01:14:01,480
The Addams family.

1249
01:14:01,524 --> 01:14:05,223
Fine. If you can't
pull the trigger, I'll do it!

1250
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:22,545
I'm disappointed in you,
Wednesday.

1251
01:14:22,588 --> 01:14:26,636
But it appears you're just
a silly little girl
playing with science.

1252
01:14:31,684 --> 01:14:34,513
Turn off the machine,
Mr. Strange.

1253
01:14:35,209 --> 01:14:37,124
I won't ask you again.

1254
01:14:38,517 --> 01:14:39,779
Aw!

1255
01:14:39,823 --> 01:14:42,129
Is little lady threatening me?

1256
01:14:42,173 --> 01:14:43,522
That depends.

1257
01:14:43,566 --> 01:14:45,698
Do you have a piano nearby?

1258
01:14:45,742 --> 01:14:48,309
Why would I have a piano
in a laboratory?

1259
01:14:48,353 --> 01:14:51,312
In that case, Lurch...

1260
01:14:52,575 --> 01:14:55,360
...show this cretin
what your cold,

1261
01:14:55,403 --> 01:14:57,971
-dead hands are capable of.
-

1262
01:14:58,015 --> 01:14:59,320
You think you're the only one

1263
01:14:59,364 --> 01:15:01,758
with a brainless
Neanderthal bodyguard?

1264
01:15:06,632 --> 01:15:10,070
-Kill, Pongo. Kill!

1265
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:16,903
Oh, this is gonna be rich!

1266
01:15:19,950 --> 01:15:20,733
What?

1267
01:15:23,344 --> 01:15:26,609
Eh! No! Pongo, you imbecile!

1268
01:15:26,652 --> 01:15:28,959
I command you,
you protect me.

1269
01:15:29,002 --> 01:15:31,439
You're wasting your breath.

1270
01:15:31,483 --> 01:15:34,660
You see, Pongo and Lurch
are former cellmates

1271
01:15:34,704 --> 01:15:36,836
at the asylum
where Lurch was held captive

1272
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:38,577
before my parents found him.

1273
01:15:38,621 --> 01:15:40,405
Back in Texas,

1274
01:15:40,448 --> 01:15:45,845
Pongo told Lurch
that he suspected
I was in danger.

1275
01:15:45,889 --> 01:15:47,412
-I didn't believe it then.
- Pongo, Pongo.

1276
01:15:47,455 --> 01:15:49,327
Bad boy, Pongo.
Bad boy.

1277
01:15:49,370 --> 01:15:51,068
I was wrong.

1278
01:15:51,111 --> 01:15:52,765
-No! No!

1279
01:15:52,809 --> 01:15:54,288
That's gonna leave a mark.

1280
01:15:57,335 --> 01:15:59,729
Stop! I had a big breakfast.

1281
01:15:59,772 --> 01:16:01,644
Don't make me
puke up my pancakes!

1282
01:16:01,687 --> 01:16:04,124
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1283
01:16:08,825 --> 01:16:10,957
-

1284
01:16:28,888 --> 01:16:30,977
Mother, Father,
are you all right?

1285
01:16:31,021 --> 01:16:32,413
Yes, yes.

1286
01:16:32,457 --> 01:16:36,200
Fortunately, we escaped
with no fatal wounds.

1287
01:16:39,159 --> 01:16:40,683
Even Pugsley?

1288
01:16:40,726 --> 01:16:42,510
Even Pugsley.

1289
01:16:42,554 --> 01:16:45,165
Oh, well. Maybe next time.

1290
01:16:45,209 --> 01:16:46,776
Wait, what?

1291
01:16:58,526 --> 01:17:00,180
How very...

1292
01:17:00,224 --> 01:17:01,878
touching.

1293
01:17:03,314 --> 01:17:06,099
My real daughter would know
that sentimentality...

1294
01:17:07,535 --> 01:17:10,060
is the antithesis of science.

1295
01:17:10,103 --> 01:17:11,583
-That's right.
-

1296
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:14,455
I lied about the DNA...

1297
01:17:14,499 --> 01:17:16,066
-re... re...
-

1298
01:17:16,109 --> 01:17:17,502
...results.

1299
01:17:17,545 --> 01:17:19,635
-

1300
01:17:19,678 --> 01:17:22,507
I really should thank you,
Wednesday.

1301
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:25,031
-You've uncaged me.

1302
01:17:26,903 --> 01:17:31,647
But your foul play
is no longer amusing to me.

1303
01:17:33,997 --> 01:17:37,087
So, I think
I'll exterminate you.

1304
01:17:40,917 --> 01:17:43,223
And your entire...

1305
01:17:43,267 --> 01:17:45,138
family!

1306
01:17:49,316 --> 01:17:52,493
Get ready to cry uncle!

1307
01:17:57,673 --> 01:17:58,848
Ahh!

1308
01:18:07,639 --> 01:18:09,859
-

1309
01:18:11,251 --> 01:18:13,253
Incoming!

1310
01:18:16,213 --> 01:18:17,475
Ophelia!

1311
01:18:24,438 --> 01:18:26,310
-

1312
01:18:35,928 --> 01:18:37,451
Oh, yeah!

1313
01:18:37,495 --> 01:18:38,714
That's it! You got him!

1314
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,112
No!

1315
01:18:48,549 --> 01:18:49,725
Get him, Fester!

1316
01:18:49,768 --> 01:18:51,204
Ink him! Ink him, baby!

1317
01:19:00,257 --> 01:19:02,346
Everybody, run!

1318
01:19:28,285 --> 01:19:30,287
Madison, would you
do me the honor...

1319
01:19:38,643 --> 01:19:41,472
Yes, I'll marry you.

1320
01:19:44,910 --> 01:19:46,651
Uncle Fester.

1321
01:19:47,826 --> 01:19:49,872
He's dying.

1322
01:19:49,915 --> 01:19:52,091
And it's all my fault.

1323
01:19:52,135 --> 01:19:54,006
Oh, Wednesday.

1324
01:20:02,667 --> 01:20:04,669
Mother, when you said
this necklace

1325
01:20:04,712 --> 01:20:06,627
was a part of every Addams,

1326
01:20:06,671 --> 01:20:08,542
what did you mean?

1327
01:20:08,586 --> 01:20:12,329
It contains a drop of blood
from every Addams
born into the family.

1328
01:20:12,372 --> 01:20:15,419
Your father, Pugsley, you...

1329
01:20:16,028 --> 01:20:18,465
And Uncle Fester.

1330
01:20:18,509 --> 01:20:21,120
Your little Addams
DNA cocktail here

1331
01:20:21,164 --> 01:20:22,469
might just save the day.

1332
01:20:22,948 --> 01:20:24,036
Lurch!

1333
01:20:49,714 --> 01:20:51,237
Bottoms up, Uncle Fester.

1334
01:21:03,989 --> 01:21:05,077
Whoa!

1335
01:21:32,409 --> 01:21:34,977
Did I win?

1336
01:21:35,281 --> 01:21:37,153
Yes.

1337
01:21:37,196 --> 01:21:40,460
-Yes, you did, Uncle Fester.
-

1338
01:21:40,504 --> 01:21:42,114
Oh, and, Pugsley,

1339
01:21:42,158 --> 01:21:44,377
it looks like Ophelia
is feeling better too.

1340
01:21:53,430 --> 01:21:56,650
Mother, Father, I'm sorry.

1341
01:21:56,694 --> 01:21:59,349
I didn't want to be an Addams.

1342
01:21:59,392 --> 01:22:02,352
I struggled
with feeling different.

1343
01:22:02,395 --> 01:22:05,790
But now,
I realize that being different

1344
01:22:05,833 --> 01:22:09,054
is the most
Addams-y thing there is.

1345
01:22:09,098 --> 01:22:11,143
"Different"
is what the extra "D"

1346
01:22:11,187 --> 01:22:13,189
in "Addams" stands for.

1347
01:22:13,232 --> 01:22:16,192
I always thought
it stood for "dismemberment."

1348
01:22:17,019 --> 01:22:18,585
Can you forgive me?

1349
01:22:19,325 --> 01:22:20,805
Wednesday,

1350
01:22:20,848 --> 01:22:24,809
you are and always
will be our little ghoul.

1351
01:22:24,852 --> 01:22:26,724
We love you.

1352
01:22:26,767 --> 01:22:27,986
Thank you, Mother.

1353
01:22:28,030 --> 01:22:29,422
The feeling is mutual.

1354
01:22:30,641 --> 01:22:32,034
And, Father...

1355
01:22:32,077 --> 01:22:34,732
Yes, my little raven?

1356
01:22:34,775 --> 01:22:36,603
I have something for you.

1357
01:22:46,091 --> 01:22:49,399
Come on, Addams family.
Let's go home.

1358
01:22:49,442 --> 01:22:50,661
-

1359
01:23:00,410 --> 01:23:01,541
Gruesome.

1360
01:23:01,585 --> 01:23:04,936
Mmm! And fragrant.

1361
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,677
-

1362
01:23:08,244 --> 01:23:09,854
-Yeah! Awesome!

1363
01:23:09,897 --> 01:23:11,029
Now, look, look, look.

1364
01:23:11,073 --> 01:23:13,597
All I did was invite
a few people over

1365
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:15,599
and things got
a little bit out of hand.

1366
01:23:15,642 --> 01:23:18,515
Yes,
there were a few injuries,
but the EMT is here.

1367
01:23:18,558 --> 01:23:20,821
They're having
a wonderful time.

1368
01:23:20,865 --> 01:23:23,650
What a lovely
homecoming present.

1369
01:23:35,532 --> 01:23:38,274
I thought
you'd never get here.

1370
01:23:45,542 --> 01:23:48,197
Let's light it up, hairball!

1371
01:23:51,374 --> 01:23:52,766
I brought it back

1372
01:23:52,810 --> 01:23:54,942
Is where the party at

1373
01:23:54,986 --> 01:23:56,770
These people out they seat

1374
01:23:56,814 --> 01:23:58,642
To clap your hands

1375
01:23:58,685 --> 01:24:00,078
And have a good time

1376
01:24:01,906 --> 01:24:03,212
In the back

1377
01:24:06,258 --> 01:24:07,912
The party started

1378
01:24:07,955 --> 01:24:10,219
Gloves and mitt, club is lit

1379
01:24:10,262 --> 01:24:11,872
One of a kind

1380
01:24:14,701 --> 01:24:17,313
To the wild, wild West Coast

1381
01:24:17,356 --> 01:24:18,488
Feeling like a villain

1382
01:24:20,229 --> 01:24:22,013
And he's a playa, playa

1383
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:23,014
In the house

1384
01:24:24,581 --> 01:24:26,452
In case you didn't know

1385
01:24:27,627 --> 01:24:29,977
We love you, It!

1386
01:24:30,021 --> 01:24:32,719
I still don't understand
a word that guy says.

1387
01:24:35,418 --> 01:24:37,202
Yeah!

1388
01:24:37,246 --> 01:24:40,988
Didn't I tell you this trip
would bring the family
closer together?

1389
01:24:41,032 --> 01:24:43,948
You're a wonderful father,
darling.

1390
01:24:43,991 --> 01:24:46,385
There's one thing
that's still troubling me.

1391
01:24:46,429 --> 01:24:48,561
Cyrus lied
about being my father,

1392
01:24:48,605 --> 01:24:51,738
but when I tested your hair
at the Grand Canyon,

1393
01:24:51,782 --> 01:24:55,742
it said conclusively that you
were not my father either.

1394
01:24:55,786 --> 01:24:58,484
Ah, that explains it.

1395
01:24:58,528 --> 01:24:59,964
I suffered a little accident

1396
01:25:00,007 --> 01:25:02,227
with a napalm experiment
a few years back

1397
01:25:02,271 --> 01:25:04,751
and lost my beautiful,
beautiful hair.

1398
01:25:07,363 --> 01:25:09,713
Had it replaced
with real Sasquatch fur.

1399
01:25:09,756 --> 01:25:11,541
I assure you, Wednesday,

1400
01:25:11,584 --> 01:25:13,064
I am your father.

1401
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:15,240
Now and always.

1402
01:25:17,286 --> 01:25:19,462
I already hugged you once,
Father.

1403
01:25:19,505 --> 01:25:21,855
That's quite enough affection
for a lifetime.

1404
01:25:24,336 --> 01:25:26,338
Well, Addams,

1405
01:25:26,382 --> 01:25:29,080
time to start planning
the next family vacation.

1406
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:32,736
Maybe a trip around the world?
What do you say?

1407
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:18,303
playing]

1408
01:26:18,347 --> 01:26:20,827
In that creepy, crawly

1409
01:26:22,394 --> 01:26:24,701
But it's looking like a body

1410
01:26:24,744 --> 01:26:26,920
Crazy but I'm confident

1411
01:26:26,964 --> 01:26:29,140
To any name they hit me with

1412
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:31,534
I think I'm all that

1413
01:26:31,577 --> 01:26:33,666
They don't know how
To pronounce that

1414
01:26:33,710 --> 01:26:35,886
'Cause I bounce back

1415
01:26:35,929 --> 01:26:37,844
My clique like a mousepad

1416
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:51,858
All down your street

They never seen

I'm in love with myself

1423
01:27:32,551 --> 01:27:33,509
That they can't touch me

1424
01:27:35,598 --> 01:27:40,167
All down your street
