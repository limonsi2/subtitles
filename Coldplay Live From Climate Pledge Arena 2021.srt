So because we're here in Seattle,

683
01:03:52,550 --> 01:03:54,580
we wanted to pay tribute to

684
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:56,250
both of the bands that
we fell in love with

685
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:59,343
when we were just young
teenagers in the '90s.

686
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:04,990
So this is a cover, this is
a cover version, this song.

687
01:04:04,990 --> 01:04:07,620
But maybe don't upload it onto YouTube,

688
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:09,370
because it's not going to
be the best cover version.

689
01:04:09,370 --> 01:04:12,670

691
01:04:14,367 --> 01:04:18,580

Make You Feel My Love.

692
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:20,430
This is not what you're about to see.

in love with Pearl Jam in 1991.

And if you told that kid,

697
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:42,103
he would be here singing this song,

698
01:04:42,103 --> 01:04:44,100
that kid would have said, "Are
you sure that's a good idea?"

699
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:47,120

798
01:14:17,021 --> 01:14:17,854
But.

799
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:23,007
I always feel a slight fraud saying,

800
01:14:23,007 --> 01:14:23,840
"This is our last song."

801
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:26,323
And then coming back eight times, so.

802
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:29,470
But I will say this,

803
01:14:29,470 --> 01:14:31,750
if you could treat it like our last song,

804
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:32,678
that'd be wonderful.

806
01:14:35,251 --> 01:14:40,251
And then with full
disclosure, after this song,

807
01:14:40,730 --> 01:14:43,323
we're going to play a 10
minute ballad, which is a,

808
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:49,450
which if you have school
tomorrow or you have a babysitter

809
01:14:49,450 --> 01:14:51,610
or you're just plain bored,

810
01:14:51,610 --> 01:14:54,460
I would recommend you don't
stay around for, okay?

811
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:56,270
So you're totally excused.

812
01:14:56,270 --> 01:14:57,407
After this song you could say,

813
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:58,347
"They played the last song.

814
01:14:58,347 --> 01:14:59,407
"It was A Sky Full of Stars.

815
01:14:59,407 --> 01:15:01,616
"The confetti went
everywhere, had a great time,

816
01:15:01,616 --> 01:15:03,166
"then I had to go back to bed."

817
01:15:04,033 --> 01:15:06,030
It's okay if you want to
leave after this song,

818
01:15:06,030 --> 01:15:08,320
but we are going to play

819
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:10,697

in the world after this.

821
01:15:11,530 --> 01:15:15,630
Okay, so with that in mind,

822
01:15:15,630 --> 01:15:17,430
I'm not really sure if I'm
making any sense at all.

823
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:19,694
It's been a while since I've
spoken to this many people.

I mean, if we were all on Zoom right now,

826
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:28,330
I'd have a lot better
chance of making sense.

827
01:15:28,330 --> 01:15:30,410
So we'll start this song again.
