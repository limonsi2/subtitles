<i>But that's not what it was.</i>
<i>The reason she wanted a chimney</i>

359
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,753
<i>is 'cause we were poor as fuck,</i>
<i>we couldn't afford light and gas,</i>

360
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,922
<i>so she would keep the fucking lights off</i>

<i>if you were having financial problems,</i>

492

<i>all you had to do</i>

493

<i>and join the church</i>
<i>and get the kids baptized,</i>

494

506
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,718
<i>And let me tell you all this.</i>

507
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:47,014
<i>When my mama discovered white churches</i>

<i>with all of our five Black asses</i>
<i>on the backseat.</i>

512
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:58,275
<i>She'd turn around, like, "Look here."</i>

513
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:01,028
<i>"We're going in this church</i>
<i>and get these crackers' money."</i>

514

<i>And my mama knew</i>
<i>as soon as they write her that check,</i>

519

<i>she was going straight</i>
<i>to the fucking weed man.</i>

520
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,590
<i>But I liked getting baptized</i>

521
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,258
<i>'Cause they treat you better.</i>

522
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:27,512
<i>After you get baptized, they would always</i>
<i>take everybody downstairs to the pantry.</i>

523
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:31,058
<i>But at the white churches, they would give</i>
<i>all five kids their own box</i>

524
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,309
<i>and let 'em shop.</i>

525
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:34,644
<i>Nigga, my mama used to be like,</i>

<i>You got one box per family.</i>

531

532
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,960
<i>standing at the pantry door,</i>
<i>looking at you up and down.</i>

<i>Like, "You ain't gonna say thank you,</i>

<i>No lie, her neck would just</i>

540
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,109
<i>She'd be like,</i>
<i>"Bitch, pick my neck back up."</i>

541
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:25,529
<i>So we would have to be there</i>

<i>I don't know what was wrong</i>

<i>'Cause as kids,</i>
<i>we couldn't go outside and play</i>

<i>We were on the way</i>

552

<i>My mama would keep my sister</i>

636
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:47,749
<i>"Hey, girl. Give me two nickels.</i>
<i>Two nickels make a dime."</i>

637
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,084
<i>But he didn't like dimes.</i>

638
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,836
<i>If you gave him dimes,</i>
<i>he'd choke the fuck out of you.</i>

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

640
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:55,131
<i>Let me explain something</i>
<i>about my Uncle Cecil.</i>

641
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,467
<i>My Uncle Cecil suffered from seizures,</i>

642
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,261
<i>he was crippled, and he was also retarded.</i>

643
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:04,474
<i>Now, calm the fuck down and let me</i>
<i>tell you why I use the word "retarded."</i>

644
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,728
<i>He was born in 1932.</i>
<i>There was no special needs back then.</i>

645
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,522
<i>He was fucking retarded, okay?</i>

646
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:12,982
<i>[audience laughing]</i>

647
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:16,528
<i>So, Atlanta, I'm gonna need you</i>
<i>to open your mind with me on this one.</i>

648
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:17,946
<i>[audience laughing]</i>

649
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,782
<i>My uncle would have</i>
<i>two or three seizures a week, y'all.</i>

650
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,910
<i>My granddaddy got tired of that shit,</i>
<i>so he came up with this good idea.</i>

651
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:27,038
<i>He thought if he bought my uncle pussy</i>
<i>every Saturday,</i>

652
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:31,710
<i>it would calm down the amount of seizures</i>
<i>that he would have during the week.</i>

653
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,046
<i>Come on, y'all, don't cock block</i>
<i>on my Uncle Cecil.</i>

654
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,173
<i>[audience laughing]</i>

655
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,758
<i>He needs love too.</i>

656
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,427
<i>-[audience laughing]</i>
<i>-[woman] Yes!</i>

657
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,638
<i>So every Saturday, no lie,</i>
<i>it was me and my sister's chores.</i>

658
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,724
<i>We had to go in there</i>
<i>and help him get started.</i>

659
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:46,683
<i>[audience groans]</i>

660

<i>[audience laughing, applauding]</i>

662
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,607
<i>We would walk in the room,</i>

663
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,651
<i>and the prostitute</i>
<i>would already be in the bed</i>

664
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,195
<i>with a whole Jackson Five afro</i>
<i>on her vagina.</i>

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

670
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:21,384
<i>My uncle would be over there in the corner</i>
<i>smiling like a motherfucker.</i>

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

672
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:25,638
<i>We'd walk up to him,</i>
<i>he always had on two belts,</i>

673
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:29,476
<i>'cause at any time this nigga would have</i>
<i>$50 worth of nickels in his pocket.</i>

<i>-[audience laughing]</i>
<i>-[chuckles]</i>

675
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,733
<i>We would take them pants off, y'all,</i>

676
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:40,403
<i>and no lie, they would hit the floor,</i>
<i>sound like you working on a chain gang.</i>

677
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:42,197
<i>[audience laughing]</i>

678
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,823
<i>And no lie…</i>

679
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,867
<i>No lie, my uncle's dick would pop out.</i>

680
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:49,329
<i>He had the biggest uncircumcised dick</i>
<i>I ever seen in my life.</i>

681
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:51,414
<i>-[audience laughing]</i>
<i>-[chuckles]</i>

682
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,503
<i>That he could not control.</i>

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

684
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:01,674
<i>And a lot of times, that extra skin would</i>
<i>hit me and my sister upside the head.</i>

685
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,760
<i>[audience laughing]</i>

686
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,931
<i>We'd be like, "Hold on, Uncle Cecil.</i>
<i>Your tip dry, nigga."</i>

687
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,974
<i>[audience laughing]</i>

688
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:17,482
<i>So we would walk him over to the bed</i>
<i>because he was crippled, right?</i>

689
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:21,277
<i>And by him being crippled, to me,</i>
<i>he looked like he walked like a kangaroo.</i>

690
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,363
<i>[audience laughing]</i>

691
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:28,368
<i>This story</i>

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

693
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:34,207
<i>And we'd throw him in the bed</i>
<i>on top of the prostitute,</i>

694
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:37,252
<i>because he can't get on his knees</i>
<i>like regular people can.</i>

695
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:40,088
<i>'Cause if he do, he gonna look</i>

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

697
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,390
<i>Me and my sister</i>
<i>would get on each end of the bed</i>

698
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:51,975
<i>while he laid on top of the prostitute.</i>

699
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:55,228
<i>We would grab him by his ankles</i>
<i>and yank his legs apart.</i>

700
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:58,356
<i>And no lie, the dick would</i>
<i>go straight up in the prostitute.</i>

701
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:01,401
<i>But since he was retarded,</i>
<i>we had to motivate him, right?</i>

702
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:05,029
<i>So we started screaming,</i>
<i>"Kangaroo that pussy, Uncle Cecil!"</i>

703
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,073
<i>[audience laughing, applauding]</i>

704
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,798
<i>He'd get about three, four pumps in,</i>

705
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,301
<i>"Granddaddy, he's back there</i>
<i>kangarooing the pussy."</i>

706
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,804
<i>"Can we get our 50 cents</i>

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

<i>[chuckles]</i>

<i>But I gotta keep it real to y'all.</i>

710
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:39,939
<i>That shit did not help my uncle</i>
<i>with his seizures.</i>

711

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

712
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:48,615
<i>He still had two, three seizures a week,</i>
<i>and my granddaddy would get to screaming,</i>

713
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:51,451
<i>"Goddammit, Cecil's</i>
<i>having another seizure."</i>

714
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:54,120
<i>"Somebody go get a spoon</i>
<i>and stick it in his mouth."</i>

715
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:56,664
<i>"But not my good spoon,</i>
<i>'cause he gonna chew it up."</i>

716
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,792
<i>"And make sure you set</i>
<i>two cold Pepsis by his head,</i>

717
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:02,629
<i>'cause when he gets through shaking,</i>
<i>he'll be thirsty as hell."</i>

718
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:06,049
<i>And I remember sitting there as a kid</i>
<i>thinking to myself,</i>

719
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,967
<i>"They are killing this fucking man."</i>

720
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:11,429

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

722

<i>He passed away when I was 19 years old.</i>

726
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:38,498
<i>I remember talking to my brother,</i>
<i>"How they gonna bury Uncle Cecil?"</i>

727
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:40,416
<i>He was like, "I don't know."</i>
<i>I said, "Me either,</i>

728
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,586
<i>'cause when he lay on his back,</i>
<i>his legs be in the air like a bridge."</i>

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

<i>My brother was like, "You so stupid."</i>

732
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:55,306
<i>I said, "I know how." He's like, "How?"</i>
<i>I was like, "Duh."</i>

733
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,017
<i>"They gonna cut a hole</i>
<i>on each side of the casket,</i>

734
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:00,770
<i>stick his feet halfway in,</i>
<i>and let his legs down."</i>

<i>My brother said,</i>
<i>"Bitch, you stupid as fuck."</i>

<i>"That is not what they're gonna do."</i>

738
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:13,116
<i>I'm like, "What are they gonna do?"</i>
<i>He was like, "Duh. He was crippled."</i>

739
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:16,661
<i>"They're gonna lay him on his side</i>

<i>But that's not what happened.</i>

<i>What happened was they broke his legs</i>
<i>and laid him straight.</i>

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

744

<i>All them times he was smiling,</i>
<i>we thought he was happy.</i>

754
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:02,665
<i>He was probably trying to say,</i>
<i>"Bitch, my dick's on fire!"</i>

<i>I've raised four kids</i>
