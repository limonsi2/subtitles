I can't afford
to lose a good cop.

You're saying
I'm a good cop?

you asking me for?

148
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:54,682
Don't you have
computers and shit?

Oh, it seems
this man's a ghost.

No fingerprints,
no records.

152
00:18:00,427 --> 00:18:02,429
Those computers
you're talking about
have found nothing.

153
00:18:04,822 --> 00:18:06,085
Sal, when you go missing,

154
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:07,738
in Cuba is there anyone
that will even care?

155
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,742
Okay, caballito.

156
00:18:11,786 --> 00:18:13,614
But I have to ask
you something.

157
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:17,139
Were those front row

Best seats in the house.

159
00:18:25,016 --> 00:18:27,280
This is Rick Calloway.

160
00:18:29,412 --> 00:18:32,720
He's a hacker.
One of the best.

161
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,028
That's the reason
he doesn't exist.

162
00:18:38,334 --> 00:18:42,338
He would be a very big deal
for you guys to catch.

Young kid like you,
looking to make his mark?

164

He knows many,

All the way to the top.

166
00:18:59,312 --> 00:19:00,661
Where is he?

167
00:19:00,704 --> 00:19:01,923
I don't know.

168
00:19:05,361 --> 00:19:07,363
No one really knows.

We cut a deal...

170
00:19:17,678 --> 00:19:20,115

00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:35,859
Is it weird when you say
we're pregnant?

185
00:21:35,903 --> 00:21:38,340
- It's ours.
- 'Cause I'm the one
who's pregnant.

186
00:21:38,384 --> 00:21:40,037
[Breslin] We gotta
think of names ASAP.

187
00:21:40,081 --> 00:21:42,562
[Shannon and Mike
continue chattering]

188
00:21:44,564 --> 00:21:47,218
I'm so excited.
You're gonna be a dad.

189
00:21:47,262 --> 00:21:49,264
[Breslin] It's gonna
be a boy, right?

190
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,048
I don't know.
I'm wearing pink,

191
00:21:51,092 --> 00:21:53,877
- so maybe it's a sign.
- It is a sign.

192
00:21:56,663 --> 00:21:59,883
[groaning, screaming]

193
00:22:03,887 --> 00:22:05,541
[screaming]

194
00:22:15,203 --> 00:22:18,728
No, no, no!

195
00:22:33,613 --> 00:22:34,875
[inaudible]

196
00:22:45,668 --> 00:22:46,713

199
00:23:35,675 --> 00:23:36,937
[computer beeping]

200
00:23:38,504 --> 00:23:39,548
Go ahead.

201
00:23:40,593 --> 00:23:42,986
[Troy] Grandpa,
where's my dad?

202
00:23:46,642 --> 00:23:48,209
[Jack] He's gonna be
here soon, I promise.

203
00:23:48,252 --> 00:23:49,776
Now make a wish
and blow out the candles.

204
00:23:51,995 --> 00:23:54,563
Make a wish.
Take a deep breath,
make a wish.

205
00:23:54,607 --> 00:23:55,869
Go on. Okay.

206
00:23:57,871 --> 00:23:59,263
[Frank laughing]

207
00:24:00,613 --> 00:24:01,962
- Yay!
- Yeah!

208
00:24:05,705 --> 00:24:07,533
[group chattering]

209
00:24:11,362 --> 00:24:12,494
[Sal] I saw his face.

210
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:15,192
The guy is fucking nuts, okay?

211
00:24:15,236 --> 00:24:17,630
He killed my guys, and then
came asking about Rachel

212
00:24:17,673 --> 00:24:19,501
with a gun to my head.

213
00:24:19,545 --> 00:24:21,068
What the fuck, man?

214
00:24:21,111 --> 00:24:22,678
I did what you asked.

215
00:24:22,722 --> 00:24:25,507
You said, "He knew
what was going on."

216
00:24:25,551 --> 00:24:26,813
[Travis] What did you
tell the police, Sal?

217
00:24:26,856 --> 00:24:29,380
Nothing, I didn't
tell them nothing,

218
00:24:29,424 --> 00:24:32,035
'cause they had-- they saw
video of Rick shooting at me.

219
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:33,080
He's careless.

220
00:24:34,081 --> 00:24:35,778
What the fuck, man?

221
00:24:35,822 --> 00:24:38,694
I made bail and I expect
your help out of here.

222
00:24:38,738 --> 00:24:39,782
I have to go.

223
00:24:39,826 --> 00:24:41,567
I have to go to Mexico
or Colombia.

224
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:42,872
You owe me!

225
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:45,571
Relax, Sal, we'll take
care of it, all right?

226
00:24:45,614 --> 00:24:46,528
[groans]

228
00:24:53,187 --> 00:24:54,231
Who else knows?

229
00:24:54,275 --> 00:24:55,842
Frank.

230
00:24:55,885 --> 00:24:58,018
Of course he does.
Fucking mess.

231
00:24:58,061 --> 00:24:59,149
All right.

232
00:25:00,411 --> 00:25:02,196
I'll call Frank,
and, uh...

233
00:25:04,241 --> 00:25:05,634
you go get him
and bring him home.

234
00:25:06,983 --> 00:25:08,811
[Travis] Yeah, yeah.

235
00:25:08,855 --> 00:25:10,030

[phone beeps]

238
00:25:31,181 --> 00:25:32,226
[Frank] Hey, Jack?

239
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:34,271
Just left your house.

240
00:25:34,315 --> 00:25:36,535
I am not too happy.

241
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:39,189
I just heard your son's
been shooting up our boys.

242
00:25:39,233 --> 00:25:40,843
Thought you had
a handle on that.

243
00:25:40,887 --> 00:25:43,019
He's my son,
I'll take care of this.

244
00:25:43,063 --> 00:25:45,544
Yeah, well,
you better, Jack.

245
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:48,547
If I have to get involved,
it could get real messy.

246
00:25:51,071 --> 00:25:51,985
[phone beeps]

247
00:25:57,947 --> 00:26:00,950
[upbeat dance music playing]

248
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:05,389
Oh, I love these freaky
drug bitches.

249
00:26:05,433 --> 00:26:07,435
What's up?
You wanna come to my club?

250
00:26:08,915 --> 00:26:09,959
Come on, get in there.

251
00:26:10,003 --> 00:26:11,134
Come here.

252
00:26:12,745 --> 00:26:14,311
You looking
for a little bit
of Molly?

253
00:26:14,355 --> 00:26:15,878
- Maybe.
- A little bit of Tina?

254
00:26:15,922 --> 00:26:18,054
- Maybe.
- I got a table,
VIP section.

255
00:26:18,098 --> 00:26:19,839
Tell them
Manos de Rosas sent you.

256
00:26:21,536 --> 00:26:23,582
Bunch of little
nasty bitches.

257

[dealer speaking Spanish]

259
00:26:26,976 --> 00:26:28,543
No, no, no. [speaking Spanish]

260
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:29,892
Don't bullshit me, come on.

261
00:26:29,936 --> 00:26:31,111
- [dealer in Spanish]
- No.

262
00:26:34,288 --> 00:26:35,376
[computer whirring]

263
00:26:40,903 --> 00:26:41,904

- [upbeat music playing]
- [brakes squealing]

265
00:26:53,481 --> 00:26:54,482
Hey!

266
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:58,355
You wanna move this little
bullshit out the way, please?

267
00:26:58,399 --> 00:26:59,443
Hey, would you--

268
00:26:59,487 --> 00:27:01,228
Oh, shit, it's a bitch.
What's up?

269
00:27:01,271 --> 00:27:03,099
- Oh, hey, baby.
How you doing?
- What's up?

270
00:27:03,143 --> 00:27:04,666
Your titty game
is all right.

271
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:07,190
Uh, your daddy can't come in,
though. We got enough men.

272
00:27:07,234 --> 00:27:08,670
- Oh, that's fine.
- [groaning] Fuck!

273
00:27:10,498 --> 00:27:12,065
[groans]

274
00:27:12,108 --> 00:27:13,022
What the fuck?

275
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,596
Everyone move in!

276
00:27:25,165 --> 00:27:26,906
- [grunting]
- [people screaming]

277
00:27:26,949 --> 00:27:28,516
[groans]

278
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,652
Get the fuck out of here.

279
00:27:35,523 --> 00:27:37,133
Where's my wife?

280
00:27:37,177 --> 00:27:39,440
[laughs] I ain't telling you
a fucking thing.

281
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:44,793
Okay, okay, look.
Hey, look. All right, okay.

282
00:27:44,837 --> 00:27:46,186
I was moving her,
all right?

283
00:27:47,578 --> 00:27:49,015
I put her on a truck
to fucking Little Rock.

284
00:27:49,058 --> 00:27:50,320
Some dude named
Diego wanted her.

285
00:27:51,626 --> 00:27:54,629
Frank or John?

286
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,109
Come on, man. I told
you everything I know.

287
00:27:56,152 --> 00:27:57,371
[police sirens approaching]

288
00:27:57,414 --> 00:27:59,068
It's your last chance.

289
00:27:59,112 --> 00:28:00,679
Diego, Diego!

290
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,470
Fuck, fuck.

291
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:16,869
Hello,
Detective Breslin.

292
00:28:16,912 --> 00:28:18,871
Put the gun down, Rick.

293
00:28:20,786 --> 00:28:22,396
Am I under arrest?

294
00:28:22,439 --> 00:28:23,789
[gunshot echoes]

295
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,194
[door opens]

296
00:28:48,074 --> 00:28:49,989
I asked you to come alone.

297
00:28:50,032 --> 00:28:51,991
Yeah, why am I here?

298
00:28:53,035 --> 00:28:54,733
I mean, you have, uh--

299
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:55,951
what is it, D?

300
00:28:56,952 --> 00:28:58,040
Three lawyers.

301
00:28:59,302 --> 00:29:00,782
And they all say,
you're not talking, so...

302
00:29:00,826 --> 00:29:03,219
Yeah, lawyers.

303
00:29:03,263 --> 00:29:06,266
Um, well, uh...

304
00:29:11,097 --> 00:29:15,928
I know who murdered
Shannon, your wife.

305
00:29:18,278 --> 00:29:19,801
Tell me their names.

306
00:29:19,845 --> 00:29:21,716
We make a deal.

307
00:29:24,023 --> 00:29:29,158
I'm being transferred
to Arkansas,

308
00:29:29,202 --> 00:29:33,249
and a very powerful man
has put a half million
dollar hit on my head.

309
00:29:33,293 --> 00:29:35,469
Yeah, I really don't
feel sorry for you.

310
00:29:37,123 --> 00:29:39,038
He's a cheap bastard.

311
00:29:39,081 --> 00:29:43,825
My-my point is, keep me
alive during the transfer,

312
00:29:43,869 --> 00:29:47,176
and I will not only
give you the-the keys

313
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,440
to said
"powerful man's" empire,

314
00:29:50,484 --> 00:29:53,835
but, more importantly,
I will--

315
00:29:53,879 --> 00:29:59,536
I will give you the names
of those who murdered your wife.

316
00:30:03,976 --> 00:30:06,282
Three men...

317
00:30:06,326 --> 00:30:10,634
and one woman
threw her over a balcony.

318
00:30:10,678 --> 00:30:11,722
I'm sorry.

319
00:30:11,766 --> 00:30:14,943
She-she was pregnant.

320
00:30:14,987 --> 00:30:16,684
She was gonna have a boy.

321
00:30:16,727 --> 00:30:19,382
- You're a sick fuck.
- I'm sorry.

322
00:30:21,123 --> 00:30:21,950
Mike.

323
00:30:21,994 --> 00:30:23,517
- I'm sorry.
- Mike.

324
00:30:24,735 --> 00:30:25,562
[door slams]

325
00:30:27,434 --> 00:30:29,044
[Jack] All right,
burn it in here, man.

326
00:30:32,482 --> 00:30:34,310
That was a good--
that was a good one.

327
00:30:34,354 --> 00:30:35,268
Good fast ball.

328
00:30:35,311 --> 00:30:36,443
Maybe I could
be a pitcher.

329
00:30:36,486 --> 00:30:37,705
Why not?

330
00:30:38,706 --> 00:30:40,882
Jack, he's here.

331
00:30:40,926 --> 00:30:42,797
How about-how about a--
a second baseman?

332
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:43,885
Get in front of the ball.

333
00:30:46,192 --> 00:30:48,020
That's a good play.
Here.

334
00:30:48,063 --> 00:30:50,152
- Thank you.
- Play with Lily for a while?

335
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:52,807
He's getting good.

336
00:31:01,033 --> 00:31:02,034
John.

337
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:05,907
Disappointed to see me?

338
00:31:05,951 --> 00:31:08,431
No, not at all.

339
00:31:08,475 --> 00:31:09,868
I'm always delighted
to see you.

340
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:12,218
You look like you
could use a drink.

341
00:31:12,261 --> 00:31:13,610
- Would you like one?
- Please.

342
00:31:15,264 --> 00:31:16,744
Let me get one for you.

343
00:31:28,974 --> 00:31:29,931
How's your grandmother?

344
00:31:29,975 --> 00:31:32,238
Oh, uh, she's, um...

345
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:34,849
about as well
as she can be.

346
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:37,199
She's a kind a woman.

347
00:31:37,243 --> 00:31:39,636
Hmm. She's keeping
her sense of humor.

348
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,724
- Is she?
- Yeah.

349
00:31:40,768 --> 00:31:42,465
Good.

350
00:31:42,509 --> 00:31:44,511
It's good
to see you, kid. Salud.

351
00:31:45,991 --> 00:31:46,861
[glasses clink]

352
00:31:50,256 --> 00:31:51,866
- [John exhales]
- What's on your mind?

353
00:31:56,305 --> 00:31:57,219
Um...

354
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,834
Three more drop houses
in New York were raided
this morning.

355
00:32:03,878 --> 00:32:06,054
Yeah, I know.

356
00:32:06,098 --> 00:32:08,709
Frank believes
Rick is talking.

357
00:32:08,752 --> 00:32:10,102
I got the best lawyers
in New York

358
00:32:10,145 --> 00:32:12,060
- who assure me he is not.
- Yeah.

359
00:32:12,104 --> 00:32:13,975
There's a lot of product
that was seized, Jack.

360
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:17,326
It's not-- it's not
like a small deal.

361
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:18,762
- It's--
- Hey.

362
00:32:18,806 --> 00:32:20,677
- It's, uh--
- I'm well aware
of the problem.

363
00:32:22,592 --> 00:32:23,680
Come on, spit it out.

364
00:32:25,682 --> 00:32:27,293
I know it was Rick.

365
00:32:27,336 --> 00:32:29,382
- You personally know?
- Yes.

366
00:32:31,036 --> 00:32:33,342
- Rick has been sending--
- Hey, hey, hey,
hold on a minute.

367
00:32:33,386 --> 00:32:34,778
How do you know?

368
00:32:34,822 --> 00:32:41,089
Rick has been sending
information to my father.

369
00:32:43,135 --> 00:32:44,179
What kind of information?

370
00:32:44,223 --> 00:32:46,616
Personal information,
Jack,

371
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,879
that my father has
no business knowing.

372
00:32:48,923 --> 00:32:51,143
Hmm. I understand.

373
00:32:53,797 --> 00:32:55,886
Okay, so it's Rick's...

374
00:32:55,930 --> 00:33:00,239
sending Frank pictures
of you and your boyfriend.

375
00:33:00,282 --> 00:33:03,807
I mean, that's a violation
of your personal sovereignty,

376
00:33:03,851 --> 00:33:06,680
but how the fuck
does that mean
he's talking to the Feds?

377
00:33:09,857 --> 00:33:11,685
Because I value
our friendship,

378
00:33:11,728 --> 00:33:13,774
- it's important
that I come here...
- Hold that thought.

379
00:33:13,817 --> 00:33:16,211
- ...to tell you your face--
I have to.
- Hold that thought.

380
00:33:16,255 --> 00:33:18,126
I'll get you a refill.
That was the cheap stuff.

381
00:33:20,172 --> 00:33:23,044
We can get
the good stuff here, okay?

382
00:33:24,219 --> 00:33:25,612
Now...

383
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,443
What would be in it
for him?

384
00:33:32,706 --> 00:33:33,794
I don't know.

385
00:33:35,535 --> 00:33:37,189
I don't know,
but it's done.

386
00:34:07,393 --> 00:34:08,611
[chair squeaks]

387
00:34:19,448 --> 00:34:21,668
[airplane engine roaring]

388
00:34:53,613 --> 00:34:55,267
Detective Carter.

389
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,529
Our transport's this way.

390
00:34:56,572 --> 00:35:01,099
I, um, I need to use
the-the restroom.

391
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:04,058
You got one minute,
little guy. Be quick.

392
00:35:15,287 --> 00:35:16,636
First time in Little Rock?

393
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:18,290
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

394
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:19,508
[Breslin groans]

395
00:35:22,642 --> 00:35:24,122
- [alarm ringing]
- [groaning]

396
00:35:31,172 --> 00:35:32,130
[grunting]

397
00:35:34,741 --> 00:35:35,655
[groaning]

398
00:35:52,628 --> 00:35:53,803
[groaning]

399
00:35:58,068 --> 00:35:58,982
[groans]

400
00:36:00,506 --> 00:36:01,333
[grunting]

401
00:36:06,251 --> 00:36:07,904
[DeSimone groaning]

402
00:36:17,044 --> 00:36:17,958
[Travis groans]

403
00:36:28,664 --> 00:36:30,100
[alarm wailing]

404
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,500
- Are you okay?
- [Breslin groaning]

405
00:36:38,544 --> 00:36:39,893
[coughing]

406
00:36:58,303 --> 00:36:59,217
[Carter] Breslin.

407
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,522
This way.

408
00:37:10,358 --> 00:37:11,620
[alarm continues wailing]

409
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,594
[tires screeching]

410
00:37:30,683 --> 00:37:32,119
[car engine revving]

411
00:37:35,644 --> 00:37:38,081
Adam-4, code 8.
Black Sedan
heading north east.

412
00:37:42,999 --> 00:37:44,436
The getaway vehicle
you all reported

413
00:37:44,479 --> 00:37:47,395
was a family of four
scared out of their wits.

414
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:51,443
All right, look,
Rick Calloway is a bit
of a wanted man around here.

415
00:37:51,486 --> 00:37:54,750
Hell, come tomorrow,
I'll find him strung up
on a bridge somewhere,

416
00:37:54,794 --> 00:37:56,274
and I'll call you
when I do.

417
00:37:58,232 --> 00:37:59,277
Detective...

418
00:38:02,367 --> 00:38:05,370
Go back to New York.
You're done here.

419
00:38:07,067 --> 00:38:08,242
Thank you, Sheriff.

420
00:38:11,071 --> 00:38:11,985
Hey.

421
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,988
Breslin.

422
00:38:16,468 --> 00:38:17,469
A word?

423
00:38:18,818 --> 00:38:21,168
Chief Taye Biggs,
Arkansas State Troopers.

424
00:38:21,211 --> 00:38:22,778
I heard what happened
to your partner.

425
00:38:22,822 --> 00:38:24,432
I assure you we're gonna
do everything we can

426
00:38:24,476 --> 00:38:26,216
to find out what
the hell happened.

427
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,914
I'd like to stick
around to help.

428
00:38:27,957 --> 00:38:30,960
All right. All right,
we can do that.

429
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:34,747
We already have
some history here
with Carter,

430
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:38,751
so we're gonna let you act
as liaison with my office.

431
00:38:38,794 --> 00:38:40,100
All right?
In the meantime,

432
00:38:40,143 --> 00:38:42,189
why don't you go
get some shuteye,

433
00:38:42,232 --> 00:38:44,452
and then we can talk?

434
00:38:44,496 --> 00:38:48,369
And just so you know,
this is my jurisdiction.

435
00:38:53,505 --> 00:38:54,419
Huh?

436
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,551
You got it.

437
00:38:58,858 --> 00:39:00,338
[Carter]
Truck's over here.

438
00:39:30,411 --> 00:39:31,717
[Breslin]
You all right?

439
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,197
Yeah, I'm okay.
Thanks.

440
00:39:34,241 --> 00:39:35,198
You?

441
00:39:35,242 --> 00:39:36,678
Just lost
one of my best friends.

442
00:39:36,722 --> 00:39:37,810
I'm not sure how I am.

443
00:39:40,073 --> 00:39:41,161
So you're a sheriff?

444
00:39:42,249 --> 00:39:44,207
Yes, sir.

445
00:39:44,251 --> 00:39:46,122
You look like you just
got out of the academy.

446
00:39:46,166 --> 00:39:48,342
Huh, I was thinking
the same thing about you.

447
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:51,954
Okay, yeah, all right,
I understand.

448
00:39:51,998 --> 00:39:55,175
I'm actually, uh,
the first person
in my family

449
00:39:55,218 --> 00:39:56,350
to graduate college.

450
00:39:57,525 --> 00:39:58,613
Arkansas State.

451
00:40:00,267 --> 00:40:01,964
Got a degree
in criminal justice,

452
00:40:02,008 --> 00:40:04,184
applied to Lonoke PD,

453
00:40:04,227 --> 00:40:05,446
worked that
for a couple years,

454
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:06,795
and applied for sheriff.

455
00:40:08,754 --> 00:40:10,625
You wanna know why Biggs
put you to spy on me?

456
00:40:13,149 --> 00:40:14,542
Sure.

457
00:40:15,935 --> 00:40:17,937
Diminished responsibility.

458
00:40:18,938 --> 00:40:20,200
I have another theory.

459
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:22,594
What's that?

460
00:40:23,638 --> 00:40:27,599
Well, you see, I have this,
like, special ability, right?

461
00:40:27,642 --> 00:40:29,427
I can, um...

462
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:30,950
I can tolerate assholes.

463
00:40:30,993 --> 00:40:33,039
- Oh.
- So.

464
00:40:33,082 --> 00:40:34,257
Ouch.

465
00:40:34,301 --> 00:40:36,564
Pretty sure that had
something to do with it.

466
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:38,131
Well, we'll see if
he's right or not.

467
00:40:38,174 --> 00:40:39,785
[laughs] I guess we will.

468
00:41:05,506 --> 00:41:07,203
Uh...

469
00:41:07,247 --> 00:41:11,033
So, when will I
see my, uh, father?

470
00:41:11,077 --> 00:41:12,731
[phone ringing]

471
00:41:18,214 --> 00:41:21,653
[speaking Spanish]

472
00:41:25,526 --> 00:41:27,006
Oh, okay. [chuckles]

473
00:41:28,007 --> 00:41:28,834
Yeah.

474
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:35,014
- Oh, I don't.
- Sí.

475
00:41:35,057 --> 00:41:36,581
Thanks, I don't smoke.

476
00:41:36,624 --> 00:41:40,410
Yeah, you really
shouldn't do that.

477
00:41:40,454 --> 00:41:43,631
The tobacco corporations
are conglomerates

478
00:41:43,675 --> 00:41:45,546
that cause mass death, see?

479
00:41:51,596 --> 00:41:53,336
Yeah, see, I, uh--

480
00:41:54,816 --> 00:41:57,340
I don't smoke tobacco,

481
00:41:57,384 --> 00:42:01,214
but, uh, I do like mota.

482
00:42:01,257 --> 00:42:03,346
- Uh. Okay, yeah.
- I like that. Yeah.

483
00:42:06,175 --> 00:42:07,176
[chuckles]

484
00:42:19,928 --> 00:42:21,974
Wow, you got pretty
good stuff, huh?

485
00:42:22,017 --> 00:42:25,934
I guess that's part
of the cartel perk.

486
00:42:25,978 --> 00:42:28,633
So, uh...

487
00:42:29,764 --> 00:42:31,418
I'm gonna have
a bad high, huh?

488
00:42:33,072 --> 00:42:33,986
Yeah.

489
00:42:37,511 --> 00:42:39,165
I got you.

490
00:42:39,208 --> 00:42:40,601
- [Jack] The whole thing
is a clusterfuck.
- [Troy] That hurt!

491
00:42:40,645 --> 00:42:42,777
- Well, you have
your son involved.
- Uh-huh.

492
00:42:42,821 --> 00:42:44,387
Biggs told NYPD
to stick around.

493
00:42:44,431 --> 00:42:46,433
- Get Dodge over there.
- He is.

494
00:42:46,476 --> 00:42:48,304
[Jack] All right.

495
00:42:48,348 --> 00:42:50,655
- All right, and then
get Frank on the phone.
- I'm on it.

496
00:42:50,698 --> 00:42:52,961
- Come on, Papa, let's play.
- I gotta work for a while.

497
00:42:53,005 --> 00:42:54,136
You go play with Lily, yeah?

498
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,703
When are my parents
coming to get me?

499
00:42:55,747 --> 00:42:56,791
- Lily!
- Hey.

500
00:42:57,836 --> 00:42:58,837
- Come on, baby.
- Frank.

501
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,186
He doesn't wanna
talk to you, Jack.

502
00:43:00,229 --> 00:43:02,710
Tell them nothing moves
until we talk.

503
00:43:02,754 --> 00:43:04,582
- You sure that's smart?
- Yep.

504
00:43:09,543 --> 00:43:11,545
[Connors] They're having
the body flown to Jersey
tomorrow.

505
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,377
The family asked if you
would carry the flag.

506
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:18,987
I won't be back in time.

507
00:43:20,293 --> 00:43:21,990
You need anything?

508
00:43:22,034 --> 00:43:23,862
Styles and some gear.

509
00:43:25,646 --> 00:43:27,039
Mike, make sure
whoever did this

510
00:43:27,082 --> 00:43:29,084
knows not to fuck
with the NYPD.

511
00:43:31,826 --> 00:43:32,740
[phone beeps]

512
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,543
[grunting]

513
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:10,604
Morning.

514
00:44:12,737 --> 00:44:13,738
[birds chirping]

515
00:44:13,781 --> 00:44:15,827
Breakfast tacos?

516
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:17,306
Eggs and tortilla?
Yeah, sure.

517
00:44:18,873 --> 00:44:20,309
Something like that.

518
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:40,895
[indistinct chatter]

519
00:44:42,157 --> 00:44:43,158
Thank you.

520
00:44:46,379 --> 00:44:47,467
You said "taco."

521
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:49,034
Yes, I did.

522
00:44:50,426 --> 00:44:51,689
This is a burrito.

523
00:44:53,473 --> 00:44:55,867
You know, I went
to New York once...

524
00:44:57,346 --> 00:44:58,783
and, um,

525
00:44:58,826 --> 00:45:00,698
when I asked for hot sauce,
they brought me ketchup.

526
00:45:02,395 --> 00:45:03,526
What flavor?

527
00:45:04,527 --> 00:45:05,615
Heinz 57.

528
00:45:07,226 --> 00:45:08,270
Move over.
Move over, man.

529
00:45:08,314 --> 00:45:11,447
- Hey.
- Hey, stop!
Stop it!

530
00:45:11,491 --> 00:45:13,667
What the--
Sit down, sit down.

531
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:16,104
Sit down.

532
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:27,768
George, Breslin, NYPD.

533
00:45:27,812 --> 00:45:29,117
[scoffs]

534
00:45:29,161 --> 00:45:30,510
NYPD?

535
00:45:30,553 --> 00:45:32,642
I thought he'd be older,
or bigger, or somethin'.

536
00:45:32,686 --> 00:45:33,818
What up,
little white boy?

537
00:45:33,861 --> 00:45:35,558
You got some cars
to work on or something?

538
00:45:35,602 --> 00:45:37,299
- You got some people
to shoot for no reason?
- Okay.

539
00:45:39,214 --> 00:45:42,435
- George is my CI.
- Hey, I'm no one's anything.

540
00:45:42,478 --> 00:45:45,046
I do what I do
when I do to survive.

541
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:47,309
The perks
ain't bad neither.

542
00:45:47,353 --> 00:45:48,354
What the fuck is this?

543
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:51,966
[Carter] What can you tell us
about Rick Calloway?

544
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:54,752
- Shit, I don't know nothing.
- George, I'm not playing.

545
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:57,842
Come on.

546
00:46:01,454 --> 00:46:04,631
Frank Diego made a hit
on him for about 500 grand.

547
00:46:04,674 --> 00:46:08,113
Word is, crews are lined up
all down the highway
to take the fool down,

548
00:46:08,156 --> 00:46:09,984
but somebody
got to him first.

549
00:46:10,028 --> 00:46:11,899
- Who?
- Fuck if I know.

550
00:46:11,943 --> 00:46:13,988
But everybody's still looking,
because the hit's still open

551
00:46:14,032 --> 00:46:15,555
and the price has been upped.

552
00:46:15,598 --> 00:46:16,686
How much?

553
00:46:18,471 --> 00:46:20,168
One million dollars.

554
00:46:21,604 --> 00:46:22,780
On one hit.

555
00:46:24,346 --> 00:46:26,000
Let's pay his father
a visit.

556
00:46:27,436 --> 00:46:29,612
- Jack Calloway?
- Yep.

557
00:46:29,656 --> 00:46:31,179
No, we'd need Biggs
to approve that.

558
00:46:31,223 --> 00:46:32,877
If Rick's not dead,
Jack has him.

559
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,704
[laughs] Oh, shit!

560
00:46:34,748 --> 00:46:36,663
Little white boy talk
like he knows something, huh?

561
00:46:38,317 --> 00:46:40,841
Listen, Frank Diego
make a hit,

562
00:46:40,885 --> 00:46:43,452
even Jesus Christ
himself can't stop it.

563
00:46:43,496 --> 00:46:46,804
Nah, brah, Pops sitting
home with his mouth shut,

564
00:46:46,847 --> 00:46:48,806
waiting to identify
the body.

565
00:46:48,849 --> 00:46:50,720
Now you shut
your goofy ass up.

566
00:46:50,764 --> 00:46:53,767
Don't come by here no more.
You're gonna get me fucked up.

567
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:07,389
[Jack] Is that Simon,
your favorite right there?

568
00:47:07,433 --> 00:47:09,827
Hey, don't-don't
use too much food.

569
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:11,393
Why not?

570
00:47:11,437 --> 00:47:13,787
'Cause some creatures don't
know when to stop eating.

571
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,702
Do their bellies explode?

572
00:47:18,705 --> 00:47:20,446
Jack, it's Frank.

573
00:47:21,795 --> 00:47:23,579
Frank, Frank, Frank.

574
00:47:23,623 --> 00:47:25,407
We lost another
location this morning.

575
00:47:25,451 --> 00:47:26,800
That's five this week.

576
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:29,585
I know, I know, I heard.
It's not Rick.

577
00:47:30,935 --> 00:47:33,415
Where's your son, Jack?
Who has him?

578
00:47:33,459 --> 00:47:35,069
You tell me.

579
00:47:35,113 --> 00:47:36,854
I mean, with a fucking half
a million dollar price
on his head,

580
00:47:36,897 --> 00:47:38,507
what the fuck did you expect
was gonna happen?

581
00:47:38,551 --> 00:47:39,769
He's gonna run.

582
00:47:39,813 --> 00:47:41,989
I'd expect somebody
to collect that money.

583
00:47:42,033 --> 00:47:44,949
Now I'll bring him in, Frank,
and it's not Rick.

584
00:47:44,992 --> 00:47:47,255
Let me handle my son,
please.

585
00:47:47,299 --> 00:47:49,301
Nah, it's too late
for that, Jack.

586
00:47:51,042 --> 00:47:52,130
Frank...

587
00:47:53,348 --> 00:47:55,394
I'm asking you
as a friend, please.

588
00:47:55,437 --> 00:47:56,612
[phone beeping]

589
00:48:27,078 --> 00:48:29,167
Hello, son.
Sit down.

590
00:48:30,298 --> 00:48:31,386
Have a seat.

591
00:48:32,518 --> 00:48:33,432
Manuel.

592
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:37,871
Dig in.

593
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:57,195
So...

594
00:49:00,067 --> 00:49:01,677
where's Rick?

595
00:49:05,507 --> 00:49:08,032
Uh, I don't know.

596
00:49:12,819 --> 00:49:14,473
No, no, no, hey!
What are you doing?

597
00:49:14,516 --> 00:49:15,387
Dad?

598
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:17,171
Don't bullshit me, boy.

599
00:49:18,172 --> 00:49:20,696
Dad, stop!

600
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:22,872
I don't care who
you're fucking, boy,

601
00:49:22,916 --> 00:49:24,918
as long as it's not me.

602
00:49:27,486 --> 00:49:30,184
Now get up and go find Rick.

603
00:49:36,625 --> 00:49:38,018
You go after him.

604
00:49:38,062 --> 00:49:40,020
Make sure he does what I say.

605
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:51,989
[doorbell ringing]

606
00:49:53,077 --> 00:49:55,383
- [Travis] Sorry, he's busy.
- [Biggs] Just a short visit,
Paul.

607
00:49:55,427 --> 00:49:57,124
- For my sake.
- Come back with a warrant.

608
00:49:57,168 --> 00:49:58,778
[Jack] All right,
I'm not that busy.

609
00:50:00,562 --> 00:50:02,695
- Hello, Biggs.
- Hey, Jack.

610
00:50:02,738 --> 00:50:05,176
Listen, when your son
was taken,

611
00:50:05,219 --> 00:50:07,830
one of NYPD was killed,
and they just--

612
00:50:07,874 --> 00:50:11,312
they got a couple
of questions for you.

613
00:50:13,184 --> 00:50:14,837
Okay.

614
00:50:14,881 --> 00:50:16,709
Mr. Calloway,
I'm Detective Mike Breslin,

615
00:50:16,752 --> 00:50:18,711
and, uh, we're looking
for your son Rick.

616
00:50:18,754 --> 00:50:20,408
Yeah, well,
I haven't seen him,

617
00:50:20,452 --> 00:50:23,759
uh, and he has been
home for years.

618
00:50:23,803 --> 00:50:25,848
Oh.

619
00:50:25,892 --> 00:50:27,894
Well, you know, if my son
came to town with a hit
on his head,

620
00:50:27,937 --> 00:50:29,374
I would wanna make
sure that he was safe.

621
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:33,639
Well, we had a falling out
many years ago
and we don't talk.

622
00:50:35,858 --> 00:50:37,599
What about his wife?
Where is she?

623
00:50:38,731 --> 00:50:40,472
She left him, um...

624
00:50:40,515 --> 00:50:43,083
so if you find her,
let us know.

625
00:50:43,127 --> 00:50:44,954
[Breslin] So she's missing?

626
00:50:44,998 --> 00:50:46,173
[Jack] No, we care about her.

627
00:50:46,217 --> 00:50:48,436
[Breslin] Do you have
her contact info?

628
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:49,872
No, I don't.

629
00:50:49,916 --> 00:50:51,439
And other than that...

630
00:50:52,875 --> 00:50:55,661
I would say have a great day.

631
00:50:57,576 --> 00:50:59,752
And if you wanna come back,
call the lawyers, yeah?

632
00:51:02,885 --> 00:51:04,235
Thank you, Jack.

633
00:51:07,281 --> 00:51:08,891
Rick's not here.

634
00:51:08,935 --> 00:51:10,328
How do you know?

635
00:51:10,371 --> 00:51:12,199
Oh, just a hunch.

636
00:51:12,243 --> 00:51:14,549
Listen, I got something to do.
I'll see you back
at the station.

637
00:51:14,593 --> 00:51:15,898
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

638
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:20,425
[Breslin] That's a nice ride.
You know, I had one
back in college.

639
00:51:20,468 --> 00:51:22,383
How old are you again?

640
00:51:22,427 --> 00:51:24,211
[chuckles] It was
a fixer-upper, Carter.

641
00:51:24,255 --> 00:51:25,169
Okay.

642
00:51:32,915 --> 00:51:35,918
Isn't time I start
searching for Rick?
Bring him home?

643
00:51:39,444 --> 00:51:40,358
Jack.

644
00:52:07,472 --> 00:52:09,604
Hey, I just got
the system booted.

645
00:52:14,087 --> 00:52:16,350
Hi. Officer Carter.

646
00:52:16,394 --> 00:52:18,004
She's good, Styles.

647
00:52:26,795 --> 00:52:28,971
[scoffs] Excuse me.

648
00:52:29,015 --> 00:52:31,191
You know, I had to pull off
some serious fucking favors

649
00:52:31,235 --> 00:52:33,759
- to get this shit together.
- [computer beeping]

650
00:52:33,802 --> 00:52:35,064
How the hell
did you get that?

651
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,111
[Styles] Ask Detective Nunya.

652
00:52:39,504 --> 00:52:41,767
And there's Rick Calloway.

653
00:52:49,688 --> 00:52:51,037
Wait, go back a bit.

654
00:52:53,082 --> 00:52:53,996
[computer beeps]

655
00:52:56,695 --> 00:52:57,870
Who is that?

656
00:52:59,828 --> 00:53:01,178
That's Dodge.

657
00:53:04,137 --> 00:53:06,008
Where I can find Dodge
on a Friday night?

658
00:53:08,315 --> 00:53:09,664
Jimmy Doyle's.

659
00:53:10,752 --> 00:53:12,798
I'll pick you up
in an hour, okay?

660
00:53:12,841 --> 00:53:15,235
- Sure.
- Oh, and, uh, Breslin,

661
00:53:15,279 --> 00:53:18,195
make sure you have
your dancing boots on,
okay?

662
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:36,517
How long can we track them
after injection?

663
00:53:36,561 --> 00:53:39,477
Two days,
then it dissipates.

664
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,609
Do you even own
cowboy boots?

665
00:53:41,653 --> 00:53:43,089
No, Styles, I do not.

666
00:53:47,441 --> 00:53:48,703
[country music playing]

667
00:54:12,205 --> 00:54:14,425
What do you think?

668
00:54:14,468 --> 00:54:15,730
It's, uh,
quite the place.

669
00:54:15,774 --> 00:54:17,819
[laughs] It's good people.

670
00:54:18,907 --> 00:54:20,648
So how long have you
lived in New York?

671
00:54:20,692 --> 00:54:22,215
Born and raised.

672
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:23,695
Parents moved there
after Woodstock.

673
00:54:24,957 --> 00:54:27,133
- In '94.
- Okay.

674
00:54:27,176 --> 00:54:29,570
So they must be
the hippy-dippy type?

675
00:54:29,614 --> 00:54:31,703
College professors.

676
00:54:31,746 --> 00:54:33,400
- Really?
- Yeah.

677
00:54:34,836 --> 00:54:37,535
So what led you
to become a cop, then?

678
00:54:37,578 --> 00:54:39,537
Because they hated
the idea of it.

679
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:42,061
[laughing]

680
00:54:42,104 --> 00:54:44,063
Holidays must be fun.

681
00:54:44,106 --> 00:54:45,586
Oh, it's a good time.

682
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:47,545
[laughs] Fair enough.

683
00:54:48,633 --> 00:54:50,069
You have
any brothers, sisters?

684
00:54:51,418 --> 00:54:52,680
Lone wolf.

685
00:54:56,336 --> 00:55:00,166
To the lone wolf, always
hunting and never full.

686
00:55:00,209 --> 00:55:02,211
- [glasses clink]
- [cheers and applause]

687
00:55:04,779 --> 00:55:06,999
- [groaning]
- [man yells]

688
00:55:07,042 --> 00:55:10,176
[country music playing]

689
00:55:10,219 --> 00:55:12,700
I love this song.
You wanna dance?

690
00:55:14,006 --> 00:55:15,355
No.

691
00:55:15,399 --> 00:55:17,139
- Breslin, come on.
- No, I'm good, I'll watch.

692
00:55:17,183 --> 00:55:21,535
You can't keep
this tough guy act up
forever. Come on.

693
00:55:21,579 --> 00:55:23,189
Come with me.
Thank you.

694
00:55:48,214 --> 00:55:50,259
Shoulda put
your boots on, sir.

695
00:55:52,479 --> 00:55:54,307
Hey, partner,
mind if I cut in?

696
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:56,353
Party of dos, Dodge.

697
00:55:57,397 --> 00:55:58,790
What the fuck, Zo?

698
00:55:59,791 --> 00:56:01,575
I'm just trying to exist.

699
00:56:01,619 --> 00:56:03,664
You know, uh,
Zoe around here

700
00:56:03,708 --> 00:56:06,537
has a little bit
of a reputation.

701
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:08,495
[whispering] Some say that
she likes it in the ass.

702
00:56:08,539 --> 00:56:09,409
[grunts]

703
00:56:09,453 --> 00:56:12,412

705
00:56:17,243 --> 00:56:18,157

[both grunting and groaning]

707

[groans]

708
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:31,692
[song tempo slows down]

709
00:56:35,217 --> 00:56:36,436
Where'd he go?

710
00:56:39,091 --> 00:56:40,179
Son of a bitch!

711
00:56:42,486 --> 00:56:44,226
Are you working
or playing around?

712
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:45,837
Get your hands off me!

713
00:56:48,187 --> 00:56:49,710
Hey, Mike.

714
00:56:49,754 --> 00:56:51,233
Just here
by yourself, Biggs?

715
00:56:51,277 --> 00:56:53,018
Oh, I'm never alone.

716
00:56:54,106 --> 00:56:55,150
Get him out of here.

717
00:56:55,194 --> 00:56:56,195
Come on.

718
00:57:00,678 --> 00:57:02,331
What the hell was that?

719
00:57:02,375 --> 00:57:03,507
It's a tracker.

720
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:04,812
Dodge doesn't have Rick.

721
00:57:04,856 --> 00:57:08,425
Are you saying that
as a cop or an ex-wife?

722
00:57:08,468 --> 00:57:09,730
Yeah, fuck you.

723
00:57:09,774 --> 00:57:11,428
You can find
your own fucking ride.

724
00:57:13,255 --> 00:57:15,257
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

725
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:17,521
[car engine starts]

726
00:57:37,236 --> 00:57:38,498
Get in.

727
00:57:46,637 --> 00:57:49,248
- [Breslin] You're scary.
- [Carter] Good.

728
00:58:48,437 --> 00:58:49,613
[man whimpering]

729
00:59:06,717 --> 00:59:08,370
You gotta tell me
where Rick is.

730
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:14,159
Where is he?

731
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,380
- Where is he?
- [grunting]

732
00:59:18,424 --> 00:59:20,774
Where is Rick?
I know you know.

733
00:59:21,993 --> 00:59:24,648
Tell me where he is.
Just tell me where he is.

734
00:59:24,691 --> 00:59:25,866
[man screaming]

735
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:28,608
Tell me where he is.
Tell me where he is.

736
00:59:28,652 --> 00:59:29,870
[screaming continues]

737
00:59:30,871 --> 00:59:32,612
[crying]

738
00:59:32,656 --> 00:59:35,746
Where is he?
Where is he?

739
00:59:35,789 --> 00:59:38,052
Tell me where he is.

740
00:59:38,096 --> 00:59:40,141
- Tell me where he is.
- [screaming]

741
00:59:43,188 --> 00:59:44,581

746
01:00:35,457 --> 01:00:36,371
[phone beeps]

747
01:00:42,203 --> 01:00:43,204
Sí.

748
01:00:57,610 --> 01:00:58,655
[Jack] Rick.

749
01:01:00,613 --> 01:01:02,441
Well, hi, Dad.

750
01:01:05,836 --> 01:01:07,141
Hey, you can't come
home now.

751
01:01:07,185 --> 01:01:08,403
[birds chirping]

752
01:01:09,404 --> 01:01:10,797
There's nothing more
I can do.

753
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,672
What about Troy?

754
01:01:18,718 --> 01:01:20,111
I'll keep him safe.

755
01:01:22,504 --> 01:01:24,593
Keep Troy safe?

756
01:01:26,334 --> 01:01:29,163
Why do I not trust
that you can do that?

757
01:01:30,599 --> 01:01:32,210
I'll keep him out of it.

758
01:01:34,734 --> 01:01:35,648
Hmm.

759
01:01:38,259 --> 01:01:40,697
Listen, there's
a car out front.

760
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:44,875
There's a passport
and some cash in the trunk.

761
01:01:44,918 --> 01:01:46,224
Go.

762
01:01:51,490 --> 01:01:52,404
[phone beeps]

763
01:02:06,984 --> 01:02:08,986
[groaning]

764
01:02:10,552 --> 01:02:12,380
Jack won't be calling back.

765
01:02:21,825 --> 01:02:23,087
I need to know something.

766
01:02:25,829 --> 01:02:29,484
The photos that you
sent my father--

767
01:02:31,791 --> 01:02:32,966
Where'd you get 'em?

768
01:02:33,010 --> 01:02:34,576
Uh...

769
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:36,927
Where'd you get
the photos?

770
01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:38,232
Rick.

771
01:02:39,364 --> 01:02:41,322
Grindr, I don't know.

772
01:02:41,366 --> 01:02:43,672
MySpace, uh, Twitter?

773
01:02:45,283 --> 01:02:46,371
Get the bags.

774
01:02:46,414 --> 01:02:47,633
- How many bags?
- Two.

775
01:02:47,676 --> 01:02:50,767
No, um, ahem, three.

776
01:02:56,294 --> 01:02:57,904
We're gonna keep
your head on ice, Rick.

777
01:03:00,951 --> 01:03:03,170
And then my father's
gonna stuff your head
with explosives.

778
01:03:06,478 --> 01:03:09,089
And then we're gonna
send it to your son
for his next birthday.

779
01:03:11,222 --> 01:03:12,136
Boom.

780
01:03:13,485 --> 01:03:17,837
Don't-don't you think
that's a little immature?

781
01:03:17,881 --> 01:03:20,884
Fuck your dad.
What do you care?
Yeah, you're gay.

782
01:03:20,927 --> 01:03:24,191
You like guys,
who gives a fuck?

783
01:03:25,453 --> 01:03:26,541
Fuck your dad.

784
01:03:27,978 --> 01:03:29,022
Ha.

785
01:03:29,066 --> 01:03:31,503
- Let's go.
- Grow up!

786
01:03:34,898 --> 01:03:37,422
Well, okay, you got
us all out here.

787
01:03:37,465 --> 01:03:38,989
You wanna tell me
what's going on?

788
01:03:39,032 --> 01:03:40,991
Rick Calloway's been
sending me emails

789
01:03:41,034 --> 01:03:43,210
with information
since his arrest.

790
01:03:43,254 --> 01:03:46,997
This morning I received
a list of addresses
here in Lonoke.

791
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:51,305
All right, I'll go fish.

792
01:03:51,349 --> 01:03:52,829
Where do we start?

793
01:03:52,872 --> 01:03:55,396
Here. If Rick's anywhere,
it's there.

794
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,658
It's closest
to the airport.

795
01:03:58,486 --> 01:03:59,661
All right.

796
01:03:59,705 --> 01:04:01,359
All right, y'all,
let's load up.

797
01:04:01,402 --> 01:04:02,795
I'll ride with Will.

798
01:04:29,909 --> 01:04:31,650
My father likes to watch.

801
01:04:40,311 --> 01:04:42,226
[Dodge] Jack,
Frank called.

802
01:04:43,575 --> 01:04:46,491
They found Rick.
I'm sorry, man.

803
01:04:46,534 --> 01:04:47,622
It's over.

804
01:04:51,061 --> 01:04:54,760
Please don't.

Holy shit!

That's a lot of dough.

816
01:06:08,877 --> 01:06:10,357
Carter, we gotta go.

817
01:06:10,401 --> 01:06:12,098
There's an emergency
at your mom's house.

818
01:06:24,719 --> 01:06:26,504
No, no, don't, don't.

Are you okay?
Are you okay?

824
01:07:18,121 --> 01:07:20,079
- I'm okay, baby.
Just look inside.
- Are you sure?

825
01:07:20,123 --> 01:07:21,472
- Did they hurt you?
- No, I'm okay.

826
01:07:21,515 --> 01:07:22,951
- Okay.
- I'm okay.

827

It was Dodge.

[Carter] How do you know?

837
01:09:16,891 --> 01:09:18,241
[Breslin] Styles has been
keeping an eye on him
for me.

838
01:09:25,813 --> 01:09:27,641
The reason why Biggs
assigned you to me

839
01:09:27,685 --> 01:09:29,426
is because I'm expendable.

840
01:09:33,865 --> 01:09:36,650
My familyis expendable.

841
01:09:40,872 --> 01:09:42,047

[Breslin on phone] Styles,
do you have a visual
on Dodge?

845
01:10:42,194 --> 01:10:44,588
- [computer trilling]
- Dodge is home.

846
01:10:44,631 --> 01:10:46,416
Looks like
he's making lunch.

847
01:10:46,459 --> 01:10:48,200
[Breslin] Keep an eye on him.

848
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:49,723

01:15:19,210 --> 01:15:20,254
I can't breathe.

Slow deep breaths.
Come on.

871
01:15:23,214 --> 01:15:24,476
He's getting away.

872
01:15:28,393 --> 01:15:29,612
Let's just stay calm.

873
01:15:29,655 --> 01:15:31,265
Don't ever tell
a woman that.

874
01:15:31,309 --> 01:15:34,530
- [gasping]
- [dispatcher] Adam 12.

875
01:15:34,573 --> 01:15:36,053
Go for Adam 12.

[Pedro] Frank!

882
01:16:09,173 --> 01:16:10,827
Frank, there's something
you should see now.

883
01:16:10,870 --> 01:16:13,873
[Frank] Remember, fishing
takes patience, boys.

884
01:16:23,535 --> 01:16:26,016
John sent the live feed
of Calloway,
like you asked.

885
01:16:26,059 --> 01:16:27,974

01:17:08,972 --> 01:17:10,408
[phone ringing]

895
01:17:19,243 --> 01:17:20,113
[beeping]

896
01:17:20,157 --> 01:17:22,115
Jack, you there?

897
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:25,031
I found your car.

898
01:17:25,075 --> 01:17:25,989
[sighs]

899
01:17:27,947 --> 01:17:29,122
Bring it home.

900
01:17:29,166 --> 01:17:30,428
All right.

901
01:17:31,516 --> 01:17:32,430
[phone beeps]

902
01:17:37,957 --> 01:17:39,959
[police radio chatter]

903
01:17:55,845 --> 01:17:57,673
My father, he, um...

904
01:17:58,717 --> 01:18:00,197
he wasn't a very good cop.

905
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:04,027
I found him one morning

906
01:18:04,070 --> 01:18:06,507
washing blood off
of his hands
that wasn't his.

907
01:18:08,771 --> 01:18:11,251
He tried to explain but I--
I didn't wanna believe him.

908
01:18:14,515 --> 01:18:16,517
You're a good man,
Breslin.

909
01:18:18,171 --> 01:18:22,959
But if you don't leave,
this town will eat you alive.

910
01:18:25,788 --> 01:18:28,355
That-- that'd be all.
Thank you.

911
01:18:28,399 --> 01:18:31,402
No, didn't see
a goddamn thing.

912
01:18:31,445 --> 01:18:33,796
The-the cameras are off.

913
01:18:33,839 --> 01:18:35,798
- Let me talk to 'em.
- Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

914
01:18:35,841 --> 01:18:38,148
Now they're afraid.

915
01:18:38,191 --> 01:18:40,019
These people killed cops.

916
01:18:40,063 --> 01:18:43,849
What's to keep 'em
from killing a motel manager
and his family?

917
01:18:43,893 --> 01:18:45,416
Jesus!

918
01:18:45,459 --> 01:18:48,898
And, oh! Now I ran the rest
of the houses on your list.

919
01:18:50,682 --> 01:18:53,424
You got city council
members on there,

920
01:18:53,467 --> 01:18:54,730
you got Sheriff Dodge.

921
01:18:54,773 --> 01:18:57,733
Jack Calloway's
on that list,
for God's sakes.

922
01:18:57,776 --> 01:19:03,173
Mike, we know
who the bad guys are,
all right?

923
01:19:03,216 --> 01:19:06,742
And they-they-they know
where my grandkids go
to school, all right?

924
01:19:06,785 --> 01:19:08,787
They know
where my wife works.

925
01:19:08,831 --> 01:19:12,399
They know
where my mom is.

926
01:19:12,443 --> 01:19:14,793
It's a give and take
down here, okay?

927
01:19:14,837 --> 01:19:16,708
It's not an easy fix.

928
01:19:21,452 --> 01:19:23,802
Now the only thing they saw

929
01:19:23,846 --> 01:19:27,719
was a late model Mustang
driving away
after the gunfire.

930
01:19:31,114 --> 01:19:33,203
- Mike, that could be anybody!
- [engine starts]

931
01:19:34,813 --> 01:19:36,380
[Biggs] Goddamn!

932
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:40,079
- Now I gotta go after him.
- [Carter] I'm going too.

933
01:19:51,612 --> 01:19:52,788
[phone ringing]

934
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:54,833
- [phone beeps]
- Talk to me.

935
01:19:54,877 --> 01:19:56,052
[Paul] They found Rick.

936
01:19:56,095 --> 01:19:58,054
Dodge is bringing him
here now.

937
01:19:58,097 --> 01:20:00,230
I confirmed
Jack was hiding him.

938
01:20:00,273 --> 01:20:01,709
Then kill Jack Calloway.

939
01:20:01,753 --> 01:20:03,450
I'll pay you double
whatever he's paying you.

940
01:20:03,494 --> 01:20:06,410
But I want his son
for myself.

941
01:20:06,453 --> 01:20:07,803
With pleasure.

942
01:20:08,978 --> 01:20:09,892
[phone beeps]

943
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:20,816
Come on, get up.

944
01:20:29,912 --> 01:20:30,826
[groans]

945
01:20:33,002 --> 01:20:34,917
- Hello, Rick.
- [groans]

946
01:20:36,527 --> 01:20:38,659
You should have
taken my deal.

947
01:20:38,703 --> 01:20:40,183
- Let's go.
- Ow.

948
01:20:44,796 --> 01:20:47,233
[Carter on radio] Mike, you
need to think about this.

949
01:20:47,277 --> 01:20:50,193
You have no backup
and these guys aren't
afraid to fight.

950
01:20:52,543 --> 01:20:53,631
- [radio beeps]
- [static]

951
01:21:07,253 --> 01:21:10,343
- [meat sizzling]
- Your mother used
to sing to you,

952
01:21:10,387 --> 01:21:15,087
every night when you were
a baby, with the cicadas,

953
01:21:15,131 --> 01:21:16,567
while I was cooking dinner.

954
01:21:18,351 --> 01:21:19,265
Dad...

955
01:21:20,527 --> 01:21:21,441
Yeah.

956
01:21:22,965 --> 01:21:24,053
Where is Troy?

957
01:21:25,358 --> 01:21:26,707
Well, there's
a carnival in town.

958
01:21:26,751 --> 01:21:29,145
He wanted to ride
the rollercoaster.

959
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:48,425
[grunting, groaning]

960
01:21:50,644 --> 01:21:52,255
Get my boy down!

961
01:21:54,213 --> 01:21:56,824
Shh... Daddy--
Daddy's here.

962
01:21:56,868 --> 01:21:58,739
Daddy's here,
don't move.

963
01:22:02,091 --> 01:22:03,919
Funny,
'cause, um, John...

964
01:22:05,311 --> 01:22:09,272
told me about
Rachel, and I...

965
01:22:09,315 --> 01:22:10,490
John told you about it?

966
01:22:10,534 --> 01:22:11,927
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

967
01:22:11,970 --> 01:22:14,712
The whole story.
I know the truth now.

968
01:22:14,755 --> 01:22:16,148
It's okay, boy.
It's gonna be all right.

969
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:17,497
- Help me pick him up.
- [whimpering]

970
01:22:19,238 --> 01:22:20,718
I know the truth.

971
01:22:21,762 --> 01:22:23,677
Come on, John
doesn't know shit.

972
01:22:23,721 --> 01:22:26,071
Rachel made a deal
with the DEA.

973
01:22:26,115 --> 01:22:28,813
Frank found out about it
and he had Dodge handle her.

974
01:22:28,856 --> 01:22:29,988
That's what happened.

975
01:22:35,298 --> 01:22:36,386
It was you.

976
01:22:38,301 --> 01:22:39,215
[grunts]

977
01:22:40,433 --> 01:22:41,652

- [exhaling sharply]
- [groaning]

979
01:22:53,490 --> 01:22:54,708
What are you doing?

980
01:22:54,752 --> 01:22:56,536
Well, we don't have
a warrant.

981
01:22:56,580 --> 01:22:58,495
I gotta make a few calls.

982
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:00,976
Carter!

983
01:23:01,019 --> 01:23:02,325
Goddamn it!
Carter!

984
01:23:02,368 --> 01:23:03,804
[John groaning]

985
01:23:10,724 --> 01:23:12,422
Get help!

986
01:23:12,465 --> 01:23:14,032
Go get help!

987
01:23:14,076 --> 01:23:15,077
Run, run, Dad.

988
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:16,904
Run, run, run,
please, run.

989
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:19,995
- [Frank] What-what's wrong?
- [whimpering]

990
01:23:22,214 --> 01:23:24,042
Dad, run! Run, Dad!

991
01:23:37,186 --> 01:23:38,839
I loved her.

992
01:23:40,102 --> 01:23:43,192
You fucked up!
She was afraid of you!

993
01:23:46,151 --> 01:23:47,457
[sighs]

994
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:48,936
Hello!

[groaning]

1000
01:25:04,403 --> 01:25:06,188
You kill me,
and they'll fry you.

1001
01:25:24,336 --> 01:25:25,903
[car engine starts]

1002
01:25:31,430 --> 01:25:33,084
You feel it, right?

1003
01:25:34,303 --> 01:25:37,741
You feel when somebody
you love betrays you.

1004
01:25:42,659 --> 01:25:44,661
She was afraid
of you, bubba.

1005
01:25:48,839 --> 01:25:50,449
She was afraid
of you and me.

1006
01:25:54,671 --> 01:25:56,890
- That's the truth.
- You're...

1007
01:25:59,023 --> 01:26:01,025
kind of a dick.

1008
01:26:03,897 --> 01:26:05,464
Just don't lie
to my grandson.

1009
01:26:05,508 --> 01:26:06,726
[grunts]

1010
01:26:11,514 --> 01:26:12,602
Mike, stop.

1011
01:26:19,304 --> 01:26:20,436
What are you doing?

1012
01:26:20,479 --> 01:26:22,699
You gonna tell him, Zoe?

1013
01:26:25,267 --> 01:26:26,398
I'm sorry, Mike.

1014
01:26:33,927 --> 01:26:36,452
Zoe here, she'll do
anything for her family.

1015
01:26:36,495 --> 01:26:37,714
Isn't that right, Zoe?

1016
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:41,108
Shoot him, Zoe.

1017
01:26:45,243 --> 01:26:47,419
Shoot him now, Zoe.
Do it.

1018
01:26:48,507 --> 01:26:50,335
Zoe.

1019
01:26:50,379 --> 01:26:51,641
Zoe, you better shoot him.

1020
01:26:52,772 --> 01:26:55,297
Whose side
are you on, Zoe?

1021
01:26:55,340 --> 01:26:56,254
Zoe!

1022
01:26:57,995 --> 01:26:58,909
Zoe!

1023
01:27:00,084 --> 01:27:02,086
You better shoot him now!

1024
01:27:14,577 --> 01:27:18,015
We blame this whole thing
on Dodge, yeah?

1025
01:27:23,412 --> 01:27:24,848
[thunder rumbling]

1026
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:28,765
It's gonna rain.

1027
01:27:30,332 --> 01:27:31,246
Fuck.

[insects chirping]

1029
01:27:38,557 --> 01:27:39,993

[Rick grunting]

1031
01:27:57,663 --> 01:27:58,925
[Dodge whimpering]

1032
01:28:01,363 --> 01:28:03,539
Yo, Rick, I--
it wasn't my fault.

1033
01:28:03,582 --> 01:28:05,280
I didn't--
I didn't wanna do it.

1034
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:11,373
Grief feels...

1035
01:28:12,809 --> 01:28:15,202
so much like fear.

1036
01:28:15,246 --> 01:28:16,595
Frank made me, man!

1037
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:18,815
I-I didn't wanna do it!
I didn't, I swear!

1038
01:28:18,858 --> 01:28:20,599
I swear everything,
I tried to not do.

1039
01:28:20,643 --> 01:28:22,862
I-I tried to fight.

1040
01:28:22,906 --> 01:28:24,429
I'll-I will do anything.

1041
01:28:24,473 --> 01:28:26,605
Come on, man!
I'm saying please!

1042
01:28:28,694 --> 01:28:29,782
You know...

1043
01:28:32,350 --> 01:28:36,267
I'm not being sarcastic
when I tell you

1044
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:38,269
that I--
I absolutely think

1045
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:40,227
that this is gonna be

1046
01:28:40,271 --> 01:28:43,056
the best thing
that ever happened to you.

1047
01:28:44,623 --> 01:28:47,365
Yeah, just think of it

1048
01:28:47,409 --> 01:28:50,629
as a golden opportunity.

1049
01:28:51,630 --> 01:28:53,632
[heavy rock music playing]

1050
01:28:56,679 --> 01:28:57,549
Yeah.

No, no, come on, Rick!

1052
01:28:59,638 --> 01:29:01,597
Don't do this! [yelling]

1053
01:29:04,513 --> 01:29:08,255
Rick, come on, please!
Please, don't do this!

1054
01:29:08,299 --> 01:29:10,693
Please, Rick, please!

1055
01:29:10,736 --> 01:29:11,911
Rick, no!

Rick!

1064
01:30:23,156 --> 01:30:25,768
I never wanna
see you again!

1065
01:30:41,566 --> 01:30:43,699
Hey, buddy.
How are you?

1066
01:30:43,742 --> 01:30:45,527
Good.

1067
01:30:45,570 --> 01:30:47,572
- It's raining a lot, huh?
- Yeah.

1068
01:30:49,182 --> 01:30:52,708
- Do you want
a full-time job?
- Absolutely.

1069
01:30:52,751 --> 01:30:54,361
'Cause I gotta--
I gotta tell you that I--

1070
01:30:54,405 --> 01:30:56,538
I pay
a pretty good rate.

1071
01:30:58,365 --> 01:31:00,063
Let's get out of here, huh?

1072
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:28,700
[phone ringing]

1073
01:31:29,745 --> 01:31:31,790
[Shannon on recording]
Are you gonna have a belly?

1074
01:31:31,834 --> 01:31:33,226
[Connors on phone]
We've had a hit.

1075
01:31:33,270 --> 01:31:35,272
I'm forwarding the location
to you now.

1076
01:31:35,315 --> 01:31:37,404
He's in Mexico City.

1077
01:31:37,448 --> 01:31:39,058
- [Shannon chattering on video]
- Yeah.

1078
01:31:39,102 --> 01:31:40,190
[Shannon] I'm so excited.

1079
01:31:40,233 --> 01:31:41,974
You're gonna be dad.

1080
01:31:42,018 --> 01:31:44,542
It's gonna be a boy, right?

1081
01:31:48,415 --> 01:31:51,941
- So maybe it's a sign
It's a girl.
- It is a sign.

1082
01:31:51,984 --> 01:31:55,031
I'm just kidding.
[continues indistinct]

1083
01:32:01,037 --> 01:32:04,170
- [Shannon cheering, laughing]
- [Breslin laughs]

1084
01:32:04,214 --> 01:32:06,521

[Shannon and Mike]
We're pregnant!
