6
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,867
Olivia, time for school.

7
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,834
It could be your daughters

8
00:01:49,967 --> 00:01:51,500
that fall victim to this.

9
00:01:51,633 --> 00:01:52,700
It could also be your sons

10
00:01:52,834 --> 00:01:56,333
or anyone who has access
to an electronic device,

11
00:01:56,467 --> 00:01:58,266
which is pretty much everyone,

12
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,166
especially teens.

13
00:02:01,533 --> 00:02:02,500
Now, the fact that

14
00:02:02,633 --> 00:02:04,166
they have smart phones
in their pockets,

15
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,567
combined with their propensity

16
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,266
to share
personal information online

17
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,100
makes teen girls easy targets,

18
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:11,500
and that's why it's important

19
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:13,600
to get ahead
of game changers like this.

20
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:17,834
Game changers?

21
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,934
Really?

22
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:21,533
Yeah.

23
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:23,467
Game changers.

24
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,700
We can't fight these perps

25
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:27,567
because we don't know
if it's a close friend,

26
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,700
the mailman,

27
00:02:28,834 --> 00:02:31,033
or someone living
2,000 miles away in a trailer.

28
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,867
Right,

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,066
but don't you think

30
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,000
you might be giving them
just a little too much credit?

31
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,500
I mean, we got real criminals,

32
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:40,133
real problems,

33
00:02:40,266 --> 00:02:41,834
just outside of that door,
that's all I'm saying.

34
00:02:41,967 --> 00:02:45,467
Well, let me tell you
what I'm saying.

35
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,266
These vics are subject to fraud,

36
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,900
mental abuse,

37
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:51,200
and trauma,

38
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,367
and most of the times,
the perps get away with it.

39
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,400
When are we supposed
to go searching

40
00:02:55,533 --> 00:02:57,567
for these
invisible criminals, hmm?

41
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,500
Would that be after
our double shifts?

42
00:03:00,633 --> 00:03:03,734
In between
our daily online shopping?

43
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:05,867
You know who says
shit like that?

44
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,700
People who are
part of the problem.

45
00:03:12,867 --> 00:03:14,233
Okay, gentlemen,
that's enough.

46
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:40,900
All right,
go, go, go. Run.

47
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:41,967
We're gonna be late.

48
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,834
Just go, go, go.

49
00:03:43,967 --> 00:03:44,967
Say hi to Mom.

50
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:47,266
I caught you. Oh!

51
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,133
Hi, Mom.

52
00:03:49,266 --> 00:03:50,433
Mwah. Okay, don't miss the bus.

53
00:03:50,567 --> 00:03:51,967
- Have a good day.
- You too!

54
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,867
Hi, love.

55
00:03:55,867 --> 00:03:56,867
- Hey, Mom?
- Yeah?

56
00:03:58,033 --> 00:03:59,000
Are you okay?

57
00:04:00,967 --> 00:04:01,900
Yeah.

58
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,867
Uh, breakfast is on the stove.

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,867
Okay.

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,633
Thank you, sweetie.
Have a good day!

61
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:28,800
Please open up
to chapter three,

62
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:30,600
and we're going
to go through the homework.

63
00:04:31,767 --> 00:04:32,900
Headphones off, Miss Lawrence.

64
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,367
All right, is there anyone
who would like to volunteer

65
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,300
to begin
with the homework answers?

66
00:04:40,433 --> 00:04:41,734
All right,
who has an answer for me?

67
00:04:41,867 --> 00:04:43,133
We'll start from the top.

68
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:45,934
Anybody want to volunteer
for the first answer?

69
00:05:05,066 --> 00:05:07,033
This is so nice.
Like, look at this color.

70
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,100
Is that the one
you were telling me about?

71
00:05:08,233 --> 00:05:09,400
Yeah, that's the one
I was telling you about.

72
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:11,300
You literally
just put it right there.

73
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,233
She's probably
auctioning off her virginity.

74
00:05:17,266 --> 00:05:18,333
Chill out.

75
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:21,033
Please. Don't go
all <i>High School Musical</i> on me.

76
00:05:37,367 --> 00:05:38,467
Boo!

77
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,066
What up, loser?
Did you miss me?

78
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,400
What did you say?

79
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:44,533
I said, did you miss me?

80
00:05:45,734 --> 00:05:47,000
Hello?

81
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,467
Whatever.

82
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,467
You are wanted at the office.

83
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:14,200
Did you just take a pic of me?

84
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,400
Yeah.

85
00:06:17,433 --> 00:06:18,400
You kind of have

86
00:06:18,533 --> 00:06:20,867
this whole depressing
beauty thing going on.

87
00:06:22,734 --> 00:06:24,066
So what'd they get you for?

88
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,834
Don't know yet.

89
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,967
You?

90
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,500
Sleeping.

91
00:06:30,633 --> 00:06:31,834
Again.

92
00:06:31,967 --> 00:06:33,900
As if they make class
<i>so</i> entertaining.

93
00:06:34,934 --> 00:06:36,333
Miss Coleman.
My office.

94
00:06:36,467 --> 00:06:37,433
Wish me luck.

95
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,333
Luck.

96
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:42,700
I want you
to look at these.

97
00:06:44,433 --> 00:06:45,767
And tell me what you see.

98
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,233
I see my report card
from last year

99
00:06:51,367 --> 00:06:52,767
and last semester.

100
00:06:55,934 --> 00:06:57,033
You know what I see?

101
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,433
I see two different Emmas.

102
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,467
One who was driven
and going places,

103
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,367
and the Emma who skipped school,
missed assignments,

104
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,834
and stopped caring.

105
00:07:10,033 --> 00:07:10,900
Look,

106
00:07:11,033 --> 00:07:13,934
I know high school
can be a difficult place,

107
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:16,300
especially for girls like you.

108
00:07:16,433 --> 00:07:17,834
Girls like me?

109
00:07:18,867 --> 00:07:19,667
All I mean

110
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,667
is that high school is a time

111
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,400
when you want
to express yourself,

112
00:07:22,533 --> 00:07:23,367
but with social media,

113
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,066
sometimes,
how your present yourself

114
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,166
can lead to gossip.

115
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,834
I already told you that--

116
00:07:27,967 --> 00:07:29,834
Somebody else made those posts.

117
00:07:29,967 --> 00:07:31,800
I know.

118
00:07:31,934 --> 00:07:33,834
Regardless, it proves that...

119
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:36,200
when you put yourself
in those positions,

120
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,500
things can get out of hand.

121
00:07:38,734 --> 00:07:39,900
Now, the good news is

122
00:07:40,033 --> 00:07:41,800
you have the power
to reinvent yourself.

123
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,934
Think about this summer
as a blank canvas,

124
00:07:45,066 --> 00:07:46,900
where you get to choose
which Emma you want to be.

125
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,700
He wants me to do
summer school.

126
00:07:50,834 --> 00:07:52,333
Well, that's not
such a bad idea.

127
00:07:52,467 --> 00:07:53,500
Are you kidding me?

128
00:07:53,633 --> 00:07:54,533
Why not?

129
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:55,734
Because I'd rather
claw my eyes out

130
00:07:55,867 --> 00:07:57,266
than go anywhere
near that school.

131
00:07:58,567 --> 00:07:59,834
Okay, well,

132
00:07:59,967 --> 00:08:02,333
honey, I just want to see you
get back on track.

133
00:08:02,467 --> 00:08:04,967
I mean, freshman year,
you loved school.

134
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,900
I know things change, but...

135
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:08,433
come on, Em,

136
00:08:08,567 --> 00:08:10,700
I was nowhere near popular

137
00:08:10,834 --> 00:08:12,100
and I managed to make
a few friends.

138
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,800
I mean,
what's wrong with trying?

139
00:08:15,934 --> 00:08:19,133
We had an agreement--
no more bad grades--

140
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:20,367
so I want you--

141
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,000
Em, honey!

142
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:24,166
Shit.

143
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,400
Where's your head?

144
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:29,967
Okay,

145
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,233
bye, guys.

146
00:08:31,367 --> 00:08:32,633
In bed by nine.
Listen to your sister.

147
00:08:33,734 --> 00:08:35,233
Okay. I'll see you
in the morning.

148
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:36,333
Be good.

149
00:10:19,133 --> 00:10:20,500
I know, exactly.

150
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:22,367
- For real.
- We had, like, dinner, and...

151
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,367
I... I need to talk to you.

152
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,066
I'll talk to you later.

153
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,166
What?

154
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,834
What the hell?

155
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:36,100
Where did you get these?

156
00:10:37,533 --> 00:10:38,800
From Blake.

157
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,600
Oh, my god,
this can't be happening again.

158
00:10:45,467 --> 00:10:46,667
Wait, has he done this
to you before?

159
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,100
Yes, but I thought
it was being handled.

160
00:10:50,834 --> 00:10:51,867
Well, do you know
who it is then?

161
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,500
Have you spoken to him
or seen him?

162
00:10:53,633 --> 00:10:55,000
No, no, and no.

163
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:57,233
And keep your voice down.

164
00:10:57,367 --> 00:10:58,967
Look, I don't know who he is.

165
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,000
He hit me up on Facebook,
I friended him, and...

166
00:11:02,767 --> 00:11:04,367
Sending him those pics
was a stupid mistake.

167
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,700
He's-- he's been messing
with me, too.

168
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,033
He's the one that hacked
into my Facebook last semester

169
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,567
and posted
all that crap about me

170
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,467
until I sent him
photos of myself.

171
00:11:18,066 --> 00:11:19,333
I thought I was the only one.

172
00:11:21,033 --> 00:11:22,100
Wait, what do you mean
it was being handled?

173
00:11:22,233 --> 00:11:23,200
I filed a complaint

174
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,333
with some detective
at the police station.

175
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:26,266
They said they'd handle it,

176
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,834
and, honestly,
that's all I care about.

177
00:11:29,266 --> 00:11:31,533
- But they haven't--
- Look, I just want to drop this.

178
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:32,667
Okay?

179
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,200
So, whatever you do,
just keep my name out of it,

180
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,066
because if my parents find out,
I'm dead.

181
00:11:37,133 --> 00:11:38,667
Will you at least tell me
who you spoke to?

182
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,166
Her name's Detective Holland.

183
00:11:49,467 --> 00:11:50,300
Uh-huh.

184
00:11:50,433 --> 00:11:52,600
No. I will get to it.
I promise I will.

185
00:11:52,734 --> 00:11:53,900
Good morning, Detective.

186
00:11:54,033 --> 00:11:55,200
Nice work
on the Tenth Street bust.

187
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:56,200
Thank you, sir.

188
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:57,533
A couple of mistakes
on your DD 5.

189
00:11:57,667 --> 00:11:58,567
The D.A. needs it fixed immediately.

190
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,567
I will get to it.

191
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,934
I have to make
a quick house call.

192
00:12:01,066 --> 00:12:02,400
What time did you get in
this morning?

193
00:12:02,533 --> 00:12:04,100
Um... six?

194
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,467
- Six?
- Yes.

195
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,000
June, there's a pile
of case files on your desk

196
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:09,500
stacked a mile high.

197
00:12:09,633 --> 00:12:11,266
You're the best cop I have--

198
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,667
I'm sitting right here, boss.

199
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,800
I know.

200
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:15,400
You know it's okay
to ask for help.

201
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:18,000
I got it, sir, really.
I got it, Lou.

202
00:12:18,133 --> 00:12:19,433
Okay.

203
00:12:20,767 --> 00:12:22,266
Thank you for the food
we're about to receive

204
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,900
for the nourishment
of our bodies.

205
00:12:24,033 --> 00:12:25,033
In Jesus' name, we pray.

206
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,567
- Amen.
- Amen.

207
00:12:28,033 --> 00:12:29,533
Liv.

208
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:30,834
Amen. What?

209
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:33,767
You know better.
No phones at the table.

210
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,200
Sorry, yeah.
Just some school stuff.

211
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:38,100
What were you saying?

212
00:12:38,233 --> 00:12:40,633
We have two home visits tomorrow.

213
00:12:40,767 --> 00:12:42,500
Mrs. Morgan and then Greens.

214
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:46,433
Mm, we need to stop by
the pharmacy tomorrow.

215
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:48,033
Didn't you just
pick up a refill?

216
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,500
I know.

217
00:12:49,633 --> 00:12:52,000
Feels like they're going quick,
but it's been a few weeks.

218
00:12:53,433 --> 00:12:54,467
Oh.

219
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,667
Well, this looks great.

220
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,900
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

221
00:13:00,367 --> 00:13:01,934
Excuse me.

222
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:05,834
I'm looking
for Detective Holland.

223
00:13:05,967 --> 00:13:07,667
She's not in.

224
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,300
What can I help you with?

225
00:13:10,934 --> 00:13:12,066
Um...

226
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,500
I need to file a complaint.

227
00:13:16,033 --> 00:13:17,367
Hey, Ross.

228
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,367
Yeah?

229
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,700
Can you help
this young woman here?

230
00:13:19,834 --> 00:13:21,300
She needs to file a complaint.

231
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,500
Uh, yeah.

232
00:13:25,633 --> 00:13:26,700
Yeah. Send her through.

233
00:13:26,834 --> 00:13:28,133
Right through that door.

234
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:32,233
So...

235
00:13:32,367 --> 00:13:33,667
what's this about?

236
00:13:35,033 --> 00:13:36,467
Someone is harassing me.

237
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:39,633
Online.

238
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:42,533
Online?

239
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:43,633
Yeah.

240
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:45,800
Okay.

241
00:13:45,934 --> 00:13:48,166
Um...

242
00:13:49,767 --> 00:13:51,300
Do you see that office
just over there?

243
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:54,200
Mm-hmm.

244
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,533
You see that seat
right in front of it?

245
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:58,100
Just in that chair in the front.

246
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,300
We'll have someone come over
and talk to you real soon.

247
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,533
- Just...
- Okay.

248
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:05,700
Yeah, just over there.

249
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:31,700
I so do appreciate
you dropping by, Pastor Carter.

250
00:14:31,834 --> 00:14:32,967
Of course.

251
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:36,066
Of course.

252
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,700
Please,
to help with the church.

253
00:14:40,834 --> 00:14:41,967
Thank you.

254
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:42,967
It's our pleasure.

255
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,233
Thank you, Mrs. Morgan.

256
00:14:44,367 --> 00:14:46,300
I suppose we can expect

257
00:14:46,433 --> 00:14:48,600
Olivia to follow
in her father's footsteps

258
00:14:48,734 --> 00:14:50,967
and become a leader
of the town one day?

259
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,967
Absolutely.

260
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,033
She's a model student as well.

261
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,800
On track to be valedictorian
of her class.

262
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:01,000
Shall we get started

263
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:02,133
with an opening prayer?

264
00:15:02,266 --> 00:15:03,100
Yeah, actually,

265
00:15:03,233 --> 00:15:04,133
I just have to run
the washroom.

266
00:15:04,266 --> 00:15:05,633
Sorry. Excuse me.

267
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:52,700
Can I help you?

268
00:15:53,834 --> 00:15:55,533
I'm looking
for Detective Holland.

269
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,367
And you said he would
ask for explicit photos of you?

270
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,667
Yeah. As blackmail.

271
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,266
Who told you
to come talk to me?

272
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,934
Um, it was Olivia Carter.

273
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:09,633
- Carter...
- Yeah.

274
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,834
Do you know the name
of the person doing this to you?

275
00:16:12,967 --> 00:16:14,066
Mm-hmm.

276
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,266
He goes by Blake.

277
00:16:22,467 --> 00:16:23,333
Oh, no.

278
00:16:23,467 --> 00:16:25,200
There are two reports filed.

279
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:28,033
It looks like this Blake
might be a serial predator.

280
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,400
Hi. I'm here to--

281
00:16:33,533 --> 00:16:34,767
Dad!

282
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,900
Cops are here.

283
00:16:36,033 --> 00:16:37,000
Gabby's in trouble again!

284
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,166
So, this has nothing to do

285
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,166
with her last run-in
with the law?

286
00:16:45,467 --> 00:16:46,533
No, Mr. Coleman.

287
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:48,834
Actually, I'm not here
because of anything Gabby did.

288
00:16:49,867 --> 00:16:50,734
I'm here about

289
00:16:50,867 --> 00:16:52,433
the harassment complaint
you filed.

290
00:16:52,567 --> 00:16:53,667
Harassment complaint?

291
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,667
Gabby?

292
00:16:57,967 --> 00:17:00,233
Okay, some jerk
was messing with me online,

293
00:17:00,367 --> 00:17:02,700
and then he hacked into my email

294
00:17:02,834 --> 00:17:07,266
and was sending insane things
to everyone in my contacts,

295
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,867
and he said
he wouldn't stop unless...

296
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,800
I sent some photos.

297
00:17:12,934 --> 00:17:14,100
Photos?

298
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,500
Like your professional stuff?

299
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:19,500
Explicit photos.

300
00:17:19,633 --> 00:17:20,567
Jesus, Gabby.

301
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,867
I didn't know what to do!

302
00:17:23,367 --> 00:17:24,900
I just really wanted
to get rid of him.

303
00:17:25,934 --> 00:17:27,066
And that made
the most sense to you?

304
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,133
- Send photos of yourself?
- I don't know.

305
00:17:28,266 --> 00:17:30,400
I know this is
a complicated situation,

306
00:17:30,533 --> 00:17:32,100
but actually,

307
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:33,667
you filing that complaint

308
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,600
is a big reason
why I'm here at all.

309
00:17:35,734 --> 00:17:36,800
Without it,

310
00:17:36,934 --> 00:17:39,600
this might've been overlooked
as an isolated incident.

311
00:17:40,767 --> 00:17:41,900
Whoever this person is,

312
00:17:42,033 --> 00:17:43,734
he's harassing
other girls in town.

313
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:47,300
There's other girls?

314
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:49,834
Yeah.

315
00:17:49,967 --> 00:17:51,333
You're not the only one.

316
00:17:53,967 --> 00:17:55,500
Thank you for coming in today.

317
00:17:57,033 --> 00:17:59,100
All three of you
have filed harassment complaints

318
00:17:59,233 --> 00:18:00,367
regarding the same person,

319
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,800
and I want to find them.

320
00:18:01,934 --> 00:18:03,767
So what do you need from us?

321
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,734
Well, my goal is

322
00:18:05,867 --> 00:18:08,200
to find factors
that will lead to a suspect.

323
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:12,233
If this Blake person
targeted all three of you,

324
00:18:12,367 --> 00:18:15,700
then maybe there's a connection
with each of you.

325
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,633
So you all go
to Haney Regional, correct?

326
00:18:22,066 --> 00:18:23,033
Any mutual friends?

327
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,300
No.

328
00:18:24,433 --> 00:18:25,667
Please.

329
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,834
What about hobbies?

330
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,133
After-school activities,
clubs...?

331
00:18:36,266 --> 00:18:37,433
Well, what about
outside of school?

332
00:18:38,767 --> 00:18:40,467
Do you girls
go to the same places?

333
00:18:41,533 --> 00:18:42,734
I do school council,

334
00:18:42,867 --> 00:18:44,633
or I'm at church
and doing family visits.

335
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,000
I'm a preacher's kid.
What do you expect?

336
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:50,467
Well, I actually
have real hobbies.

337
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,934
I'm usually outside
doing street photos.

338
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,700
I work at the hardware store
after school,

339
00:18:56,834 --> 00:18:59,834
or I'm just, like, taking care
of my younger siblings.

340
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,266
Is there anybody at school

341
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,700
that would give you reason

342
00:19:02,834 --> 00:19:04,333
to think they would do
something like this?

343
00:19:05,567 --> 00:19:06,467
- Haters.
- Pervs.

344
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,734
Literally all the boys.

345
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:10,333
Okay.

346
00:19:11,867 --> 00:19:15,800
You trusted Blake enough
to send photos of yourselves.

347
00:19:15,934 --> 00:19:17,633
And there was something
about him

348
00:19:17,767 --> 00:19:19,800
that drew you
into a relationship.

349
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,367
How did that happen?

350
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,066
I guess I'll go first.

351
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,734
Um...

352
00:19:31,867 --> 00:19:34,200
I don't know, we kind of
just started talking,

353
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:35,567
and he was flirting,

354
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,100
so I was flirting back.

355
00:19:37,233 --> 00:19:41,233
And then he saw the work
that I upload online

356
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:43,333
and asked for more of myself.

357
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,734
And it wasn't really
anything serious,

358
00:19:46,867 --> 00:19:48,033
but we bonded,

359
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,433
and so...

360
00:19:49,567 --> 00:19:51,333
when he asked for a nude,
I just sent it.

361
00:19:56,233 --> 00:19:58,667
I thought he was kinda hot,

362
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,367
at least based off
the photos he sent me,

363
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,834
which, of course,
probably aren't even his.

364
00:20:05,066 --> 00:20:07,533
But, I mean...

365
00:20:07,667 --> 00:20:09,967
he was the one
who sent me a dick pic first,

366
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,567
so I thought,

367
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,300
what was the harm
in giving a tease,

368
00:20:13,433 --> 00:20:15,100
you know?

369
00:20:15,233 --> 00:20:16,367
Mm-hmm.

370
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:23,233
I guess I just thought
that I found someone that...

371
00:20:23,367 --> 00:20:25,800
you know, actually loved me.

372
00:20:27,967 --> 00:20:29,166
I know it's dumb,

373
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,333
but I shared things with him
that I never shared with anyone.

374
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,300
It was like he, um...

375
00:20:37,433 --> 00:20:39,000
like he saw the real me.

376
00:20:41,567 --> 00:20:44,200
And I guess I just thought
that if I...

377
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,767
if I didn't send the pics,

378
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,233
then it wouldn't have been real.

379
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:53,633
Okay, so that was
pretty embarrassing

380
00:20:53,767 --> 00:20:54,734
for us to admit,

381
00:20:54,867 --> 00:20:57,767
so do you think you have
enough info to find him?

382
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,800
We keep saying "him",

383
00:20:58,934 --> 00:21:00,300
but how do we know
it's not a she?

384
00:21:00,433 --> 00:21:01,900
I mean, it could be
anyone, right?

385
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,500
Yeah, that's right. Yes.

386
00:21:04,633 --> 00:21:06,367
It's-- it's not a girl.

387
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,233
How do you know?

388
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:11,300
I don't know,

389
00:21:11,433 --> 00:21:13,967
I just have a feeling, I guess.

390
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,200
Oh, great, you have a feeling.

391
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:16,633
All right,

392
00:21:16,767 --> 00:21:18,800
it's most likely that--

393
00:21:18,934 --> 00:21:21,400
that Blake is a man,

394
00:21:21,533 --> 00:21:22,800
but we're not going to rule
anything out.

395
00:21:27,834 --> 00:21:29,867
I know this is a lot.

396
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,133
Let's just take a break.

397
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,200
Going that well, huh?

398
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,867
If they don't kill me,
this migraine will.

399
00:21:45,734 --> 00:21:47,000
I've got three
teenage girls in there,

400
00:21:47,133 --> 00:21:47,967
and for the life of me,

401
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,166
I can't find

402
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,667
a single commonality
between them.

403
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,133
They all go to the same school,
don't they?

404
00:21:53,266 --> 00:21:55,266
Yeah, but that literally
means nothing to these kids.

405
00:21:56,633 --> 00:21:58,333
They're teenage girls.

406
00:21:58,467 --> 00:22:01,200
Just go in at their level,
get on the inside.

407
00:22:04,867 --> 00:22:05,967
Okay...

408
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,433
I want to know
about Haney Regional.

409
00:22:08,567 --> 00:22:09,533
Take me through
your day-to-day.

410
00:22:09,667 --> 00:22:11,033
I want to understand
the culture.

411
00:22:12,867 --> 00:22:15,233
Well, it's hell...

412
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:16,900
especially if you're a girl.

413
00:22:17,033 --> 00:22:17,900
Why is that?

414
00:22:18,033 --> 00:22:19,734
The rumors,

415
00:22:19,867 --> 00:22:22,066
the slut shaming.

416
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,467
I mean, why wouldn't it be?

417
00:22:25,066 --> 00:22:26,266
Tell me more.

418
00:22:28,967 --> 00:22:30,400
Detective?

419
00:22:32,266 --> 00:22:33,200
Yeah?

420
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:34,266
How serious are you?

421
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,533
I take all my cases seriously.

422
00:22:38,467 --> 00:22:39,433
I just mean,

423
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:40,367
this isn't the first time
I've come here for help.

424
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,367
I need to make sure

425
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,266
that something's
going to be done about it,

426
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,500
because my par--

427
00:22:49,066 --> 00:22:51,066
It just, it wouldn't be good
if anything got out.

428
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,633
Olivia, this isn't going
to be an easy road.

429
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:57,667
But it's going to be harder

430
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,100
if you don't
tell your parents yourself.

431
00:23:00,433 --> 00:23:01,767
I just need to know
that you're real.

432
00:23:04,266 --> 00:23:05,367
I'm real.

433
00:23:09,567 --> 00:23:10,900
We'll see.

434
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:21,367
You wish I was
more like Henry, don't you?

435
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,867
That's not true.

436
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,900
It obviously is.

437
00:23:25,033 --> 00:23:26,266
Just admit
that he's your favorite.

438
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,467
Gabby, I don't wish
you were your brother, okay?

439
00:23:31,033 --> 00:23:33,500
But he certainly is
more obedient,

440
00:23:33,633 --> 00:23:35,033
and, yeah, you know what,

441
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:36,567
that makes my life easier.

442
00:23:40,066 --> 00:23:42,400
I'm trying to do my best
by you and your brother,

443
00:23:42,533 --> 00:23:44,133
but...

444
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,066
What?

445
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,700
I don't know.

446
00:23:48,834 --> 00:23:50,166
Maybe I gave you
too much freedom.

447
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,600
You slack off in school,

448
00:23:52,734 --> 00:23:55,400
you get detention
at every chance,

449
00:23:55,533 --> 00:23:56,400
and then all you do

450
00:23:56,533 --> 00:23:58,133
is fumble around
with this photography stuff

451
00:23:58,266 --> 00:24:00,667
instead of getting serious
about your future.

452
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,867
Are you kidding me?

453
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,734
This photography stuff
is my future,

454
00:24:03,867 --> 00:24:05,800
because I'm really good at it

455
00:24:05,934 --> 00:24:07,700
and I'm very passionate
about it,

456
00:24:07,834 --> 00:24:09,767
so just because I'm not
the, like, Disney-channel kid

457
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,367
that you expect
from me and Henry

458
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,667
doesn't mean
I'm not serious about something.

459
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,934
Well, you sure have
a funny way of showing it, Gab.

460
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:21,333
Let's just
get through this, okay?

461
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,500
Yeah.

462
00:24:29,633 --> 00:24:30,734
Oh, good.

463
00:24:30,867 --> 00:24:32,834
You're here.
You worked late.

464
00:24:32,967 --> 00:24:34,300
Yeah.

465
00:24:34,433 --> 00:24:35,533
Okay...

466
00:24:35,667 --> 00:24:38,600
Kids in bed by nine.
I'll see you.

467
00:24:38,734 --> 00:24:39,700
- Mom?
- Yeah?

468
00:24:41,433 --> 00:24:42,867
I wasn't at work.

469
00:24:43,867 --> 00:24:45,533
I was at the police station.

470
00:24:47,567 --> 00:24:48,967
Why were you
at the police station?

471
00:24:50,667 --> 00:24:51,867
How could you not tell me?

472
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,266
All this time?

473
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,967
I'm sorry.
I just, I didn't know how.

474
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,433
I mean, you're always
working and tired,

475
00:24:57,567 --> 00:24:59,367
and the last thing
that I wanted to do

476
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,767
was stress you out even more.

477
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,400
Okay, well, I want everything.

478
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:03,867
I want your computer,
I want your phone.

479
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,767
I can't, okay?

480
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,767
Detective Holland

481
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,333
needs us to act
like nothing's changed

482
00:25:07,467 --> 00:25:09,400
or it'll look
really suspicious to Blake.

483
00:25:09,533 --> 00:25:11,433
Blake!

484
00:25:11,567 --> 00:25:13,033
I want to know
who this bastard is!

485
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:16,367
This is why
your grades are slipping,

486
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,367
isn't it?

487
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,700
This is why
you're struggling in school?

488
00:25:18,834 --> 00:25:19,934
Oh, my god.

489
00:25:20,066 --> 00:25:21,667
Okay.

490
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,433
Okay, well, I'll take
the rest of the week off.

491
00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:25,233
No. That's exactly
what I didn't want.

492
00:25:25,367 --> 00:25:27,333
I don't care, Emma!

493
00:25:27,467 --> 00:25:29,266
I am talking to everyone.

494
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,433
I'm talking
to Detective Holland,

495
00:25:30,567 --> 00:25:31,734
to Principal Monroe.

496
00:25:31,867 --> 00:25:33,000
I need some answers!

497
00:25:33,133 --> 00:25:35,367
Mom, we don't have
any answers right now!

498
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,500
Well, I need something!

499
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,734
I--

500
00:25:39,867 --> 00:25:41,367
I can't help you
if you don't talk to me.

501
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,200
Mom...

502
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:47,700
this isn't your fault.

503
00:25:48,834 --> 00:25:50,767
Okay, I trusted someone
that I shouldn't have.

504
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:53,667
I see that it is my fault.

505
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,533
It is my fault

506
00:25:54,667 --> 00:25:56,233
because it is my job

507
00:25:56,367 --> 00:25:57,967
to protect my daughter.

508
00:25:59,367 --> 00:26:02,533
And I can't do my job
if I am in the dark.

509
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,533
Is that everything?

510
00:26:11,233 --> 00:26:12,533
I'm sorry.

511
00:26:14,233 --> 00:26:16,333
I gave naked photos of myself
to a guy I met online.

512
00:26:20,533 --> 00:26:22,500
"And why the hell would you
do that, Olivia?"

513
00:26:22,633 --> 00:26:23,700
I don't know.

514
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:26,767
Maybe because I'm a slut
who's desperate for attention.

515
00:26:30,734 --> 00:26:32,133
Liv?

516
00:26:32,266 --> 00:26:34,000
Why are you still up?

517
00:26:34,133 --> 00:26:35,433
No computers after ten,
remember?

518
00:26:35,567 --> 00:26:36,600
Yeah.

519
00:26:36,734 --> 00:26:37,834
I'm just finishing
this assignment for tomorrow.

520
00:26:37,967 --> 00:26:39,333
The day before it's due?

521
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:41,433
You know we don't put academics

522
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:43,166
second to hanging
and chatting with friends.

523
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,834
I know.

524
00:26:44,967 --> 00:26:46,200
I'm almost done. Promise.

525
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:48,200
Ten minutes, then lights out.

526
00:27:05,967 --> 00:27:06,834
What's all this?

527
00:27:06,967 --> 00:27:09,300
About time you came home.

528
00:27:09,433 --> 00:27:10,934
You can get dinner started.

529
00:27:11,066 --> 00:27:14,467
When we agreed I would move in,
you knew I wasn't a cook.

530
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,433
Well, I'm just saying,

531
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:16,467
it'd be nice if my daughter

532
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,066
didn't subject me
to takeout meals for once.

533
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,066
You mean, your daughter

534
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,133
who's the only detective in town

535
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:24,033
and barely has time
for a sit-down dinner?

536
00:27:24,166 --> 00:27:25,133
That daughter?

537
00:27:27,367 --> 00:27:30,233
Dad, really, what's all this?

538
00:27:30,367 --> 00:27:31,734
I'm starting a garden.

539
00:27:31,867 --> 00:27:34,967
Well, you'd have better luck
outside in the garden.

540
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,667
I know that face.

541
00:27:43,967 --> 00:27:45,266
Wanna talk about it?

542
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,000
You should've seen the way
this has affected them.

543
00:27:50,133 --> 00:27:51,767
He crushed their spirit.

544
00:27:52,967 --> 00:27:55,333
It feels really messy.

545
00:27:55,467 --> 00:27:58,200
Is this even something
the PD is capable of handling?

546
00:27:58,333 --> 00:28:00,600
You mean is it something
I'm capable of handling?

547
00:28:00,734 --> 00:28:02,133
Well, what does anyone
really know

548
00:28:02,266 --> 00:28:03,433
about this kind of stuff?

549
00:28:03,567 --> 00:28:05,066
Dad, this Blake person--

550
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,100
he's gonna target more girls
if I don't do something.

551
00:28:08,233 --> 00:28:10,266
Look, all this is over my head,

552
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,233
but if it's computer stuff
you need help with--

553
00:28:12,367 --> 00:28:14,100
No. Mm-mm.

554
00:28:14,233 --> 00:28:15,700
My job
is not one of your hobbies.

555
00:28:15,834 --> 00:28:16,867
Not me.

556
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,300
Remember that computer class
I took a few months ago?

557
00:28:19,433 --> 00:28:23,100
Yeah, when you went through
your tech phase

558
00:28:23,233 --> 00:28:25,200
and you enrolled
in that web-design class

559
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:27,000
that, of course,
you did not stick with.

560
00:28:27,133 --> 00:28:28,700
Well, that teacher is a wiz.

561
00:28:28,834 --> 00:28:30,533
Sharp as a nail.

562
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,400
I need
a cyber-security specialist,

563
00:28:33,533 --> 00:28:35,867
not some community college professor.

564
00:28:39,734 --> 00:28:41,100
Mm-hmm.

565
00:29:25,667 --> 00:29:27,033
Sam Finley?

566
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:30,033
In the flesh.

567
00:29:30,166 --> 00:29:31,834
You're the cyber expert?

568
00:29:33,033 --> 00:29:34,033
That's me.

569
00:29:36,367 --> 00:29:38,433
I'm a T.A.
and teach night classes.

570
00:29:38,567 --> 00:29:40,734
CE's just my thing, actually,

571
00:29:40,867 --> 00:29:42,800
but I gotta be honest,

572
00:29:42,934 --> 00:29:46,367
I'm not really
too fond of cops, Detective.

573
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:52,066
Teaching those night classes
wasn't exactly by choice.

574
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,200
It's more a condition

575
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:55,367
to keep my ass out of juvie
from back in the day.

576
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,867
Okay.

577
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,066
Well, I could really use
your kind of expertise.

578
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,166
I mean,
I can't make any promises--

579
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,000
maybe a job reference.

580
00:30:05,133 --> 00:30:07,700
In Haney? I'm good.

581
00:30:07,834 --> 00:30:09,066
But your dad

582
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,033
was the nicest person
in my class a few months back,

583
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:13,967
so I'm really happy
to do him a favor.

584
00:30:15,633 --> 00:30:17,333
It's too bad
he dropped the course.

585
00:30:17,467 --> 00:30:18,367
Yeah.

586
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,066
He has a habit
of not sticking with hobbies.

587
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,667
No offense.

588
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,800
None taken.

589
00:30:22,934 --> 00:30:24,567
Plus, he mentioned
something about a hacker,

590
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,367
and, well, I like a challenge.

591
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,300
Well, I imagine
it'll be just that.

592
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:30,600
In November 2008,

593
00:30:30,734 --> 00:30:32,000
Barack Obama
defeated John McCain

594
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:33,133
in the federal election

595
00:30:33,266 --> 00:30:35,066
to become the 44th President
of the United States.

596
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,567
<i>Because I'm a slut</i>

597
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,266
<i>who's desperate
for attention.</i>

598
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,266
<i>Because I'm a slut
who's desperate for attention.</i>

599
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,367
<i>Because I'm a slut who's
desperate for attention.</i>

600
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,500
<i>Because I'm a slut
who's desperate for attention.</i>

601
00:30:44,633 --> 00:30:45,900
<i>Because I'm a slut--</i>

602
00:30:46,033 --> 00:30:47,400
What's the meaning of this?

603
00:30:47,533 --> 00:30:48,400
I don't know.

604
00:30:48,533 --> 00:30:50,333
My computer must've recorded...

605
00:30:50,467 --> 00:30:52,333
I'll fix it.
I'll fix it.

606
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:01,900
Looks fine to me.

607
00:31:02,033 --> 00:31:03,367
It's probably just a glitch.

608
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,834
These programs
can get finicky with the audio,

609
00:31:04,967 --> 00:31:05,834
but sounds like
it was hilarious.

610
00:31:05,967 --> 00:31:07,367
Does it look
like I'm laughing?

611
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,300
Whoa, chill.
What's up with you?

612
00:31:09,433 --> 00:31:10,600
A lot.

613
00:31:10,734 --> 00:31:11,633
There's just so much drama
with my mom--

614
00:31:11,767 --> 00:31:13,233
I don't do family drama.

615
00:31:16,266 --> 00:31:17,500
I just need something
to take the edge off.

616
00:31:20,533 --> 00:31:21,867
I got it.

617
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,433
I hear you, Detective,
I really do,

618
00:31:26,567 --> 00:31:29,233
but we can't control
what these kids do

619
00:31:29,367 --> 00:31:31,133
when they go home
and get on their computers.

620
00:31:31,266 --> 00:31:32,900
Well, that may be,
Principal Monroe,

621
00:31:33,033 --> 00:31:34,734
but it seems
the culture at Haney

622
00:31:34,867 --> 00:31:36,133
seems to be a part
of the problem.

623
00:31:36,266 --> 00:31:38,467
And what culture
are you referring to?

624
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,133
Because I can assure you,

625
00:31:40,266 --> 00:31:42,266
we certainly
don't condone bullying.

626
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,200
That doesn't mean
it's not happening.

627
00:31:46,767 --> 00:31:47,934
And I'm assuming

628
00:31:48,066 --> 00:31:51,333
these students
reported this to someone

629
00:31:51,467 --> 00:31:52,800
before bringing it
to your attention?

630
00:31:52,934 --> 00:31:54,734
- They did.
- Good.

631
00:31:54,867 --> 00:31:56,800
Well, feel free to give me
the names of the faculty

632
00:31:56,934 --> 00:31:57,900
and I'll sort this with them.

633
00:31:58,033 --> 00:31:58,934
It was you.

634
00:31:59,066 --> 00:32:00,867
And a counselor,
Mr. Klein.

635
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,166
Nothing was done,
and that's why they came to me.

636
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,400
Detective,

637
00:32:05,533 --> 00:32:08,567
teenagers say things
and send things online.

638
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:13,300
It's impossible to track
who says this or who sends what.

639
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:16,967
These young women
willingly share things

640
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,500
and end up regretting it.

641
00:32:18,633 --> 00:32:20,834
The consequences of that
are messy.

642
00:32:20,967 --> 00:32:23,633
We simply can't control that.

643
00:32:23,767 --> 00:32:25,800
So I'll ask one last time,

644
00:32:25,934 --> 00:32:27,767
what is it I can do for you?

645
00:32:28,934 --> 00:32:31,300
You could be doing a lot more,

646
00:32:31,433 --> 00:32:32,567
especially given the fact

647
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,667
that what's happening
under your roof

648
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,166
bleeds into sexual harassment.

649
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,000
If you had daughters,

650
00:32:39,133 --> 00:32:40,734
it would be a shame
if they needed help.

651
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,867
I have sons.

652
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,266
Yeah, that much is clear.

653
00:32:53,967 --> 00:32:55,834
Blake has to be using
a message software.

654
00:32:55,967 --> 00:32:57,467
What do you mean?

655
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,467
Like a text app.

656
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,600
Subscribers can use

657
00:32:59,734 --> 00:33:01,467
an endless amount of numbers
to contact someone,

658
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,400
including numbers

659
00:33:02,533 --> 00:33:03,367
that have already
been registered,

660
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,467
so even if
one number is blocked,

661
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,000
he can just pick
a different one to use.

662
00:33:09,834 --> 00:33:11,200
This guy lives underground.

663
00:33:12,633 --> 00:33:14,100
Underground?

664
00:33:14,233 --> 00:33:15,200
This is a person

665
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:16,633
who would hide
and be on the defense

666
00:33:16,767 --> 00:33:18,533
rather than the offense,

667
00:33:18,667 --> 00:33:20,033
but if you look hard enough,

668
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:22,066
they're usually hiding
right under your nose.

669
00:33:24,233 --> 00:33:25,300
Doesn't feel like it.

670
00:33:25,433 --> 00:33:28,800
Yeah. I think our best bet
is finding his IP address.

671
00:33:28,934 --> 00:33:30,233
What is that?

672
00:33:30,367 --> 00:33:31,767
Like a fingerprint--

673
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,734
for any computer or phone.

674
00:33:33,867 --> 00:33:35,233
Every time
Blake visits a website,

675
00:33:35,367 --> 00:33:36,900
that device's IP address
is recorded,

676
00:33:37,033 --> 00:33:37,867
along with data

677
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,300
of when and where
he visited those sites.

678
00:33:39,433 --> 00:33:41,800
So if we find
his IP address...

679
00:33:41,934 --> 00:33:42,900
We find him.

680
00:33:43,934 --> 00:33:45,433
Or at least
his general whereabouts,

681
00:33:45,567 --> 00:33:46,900
maybe registration information.

682
00:33:47,934 --> 00:33:48,800
Okay, and I'm guessing
these records

683
00:33:48,934 --> 00:33:50,700
are highly private,

684
00:33:50,834 --> 00:33:53,233
meaning I have to issue
a subpoena.

685
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,066
What's wrong with that?

686
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,100
Sam, subpoenas take time,

687
00:33:58,233 --> 00:34:00,467
and if he's looking
to harass more people,

688
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,066
then we're giving him
the perfect window.

689
00:34:27,967 --> 00:34:29,266
Hey!

690
00:34:30,667 --> 00:34:32,066
You hungry?

691
00:34:34,467 --> 00:34:36,367
So you still
don't eat the crust?

692
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,500
So what?
I know what I like.

693
00:34:38,633 --> 00:34:40,066
It's just a waste, is all.

694
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:43,667
I sense there's
some kind of history.

695
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,300
The frenemy vibe
is a little bit strong.

696
00:34:48,433 --> 00:34:49,300
There's no beef.

697
00:34:49,433 --> 00:34:50,200
We were friends,

698
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:51,867
then we grew up
and we grew apart.

699
00:34:52,934 --> 00:34:54,100
Simple as that.

700
00:34:54,233 --> 00:34:57,533
Well, that's--
that's not how I remember it.

701
00:34:57,667 --> 00:34:59,767
I remember rumors
being spread about me,

702
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,100
and instead of having my back,

703
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:04,533
you iced me out.

704
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:06,734
Okay, look, beef or not,

705
00:35:06,867 --> 00:35:09,567
I'm just honestly glad
that I found you guys,

706
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,066
because these past few weeks
have been miserable.

707
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,066
Consider yourself lucky.

708
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,033
I've had to deal
with this asshole

709
00:35:15,166 --> 00:35:16,600
for two whole months.

710
00:35:19,567 --> 00:35:20,767
What about you, Emma?

711
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,834
Since May.

712
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,867
- As in--
- Last year.

713
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,200
Yeah.

714
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:37,867
Hey, every time I blocked
one of his numbers,

715
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,400
he contacted me back
with a new one.

716
00:35:39,533 --> 00:35:40,800
Same.

717
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,433
Until now, we thought
we were the only ones,

718
00:35:44,567 --> 00:35:46,500
and I doubt he anticipated
us finding each other,

719
00:35:46,633 --> 00:35:49,200
so let's compare
blocked numbers blocked,

720
00:35:49,333 --> 00:35:50,233
see if there's a match.

721
00:35:50,367 --> 00:35:51,333
Yeah.

722
00:35:52,367 --> 00:35:54,033
That's a good idea.

723
00:35:54,166 --> 00:35:55,233
Okay, 1-996.

724
00:35:55,367 --> 00:35:57,567
Do you guys have
a number like that?

725
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,667
- I don't.
- I don't think so.

726
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,066
I don't think that I have 2480.

727
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,000
No, wait--

728
00:36:02,133 --> 00:36:03,133
no, the last four digits
are different.

729
00:36:03,266 --> 00:36:05,533
I don't have any 800s.

730
00:36:11,233 --> 00:36:12,734
So, there's not
a single match between us?

731
00:36:15,533 --> 00:36:16,867
How the hell is he doing this?

732
00:36:29,767 --> 00:36:31,100
Gabby.

733
00:36:34,767 --> 00:36:37,300
If you want to get accepted
into the summer program,

734
00:36:37,433 --> 00:36:39,900
you're doing a good job
of messing up your chances.

735
00:36:40,033 --> 00:36:41,266
What's going on?

736
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,900
I just have a lot on my plate.

737
00:36:44,934 --> 00:36:46,900
Look, Gabby, I'm not buying it.

738
00:36:47,033 --> 00:36:49,166
You haven't even
developed the film

739
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,600
from your last two assignments.

740
00:36:51,767 --> 00:36:53,300
I haven't gotten
the right shots yet.

741
00:36:53,433 --> 00:36:55,967
I can only recommend one person

742
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,600
for the Rhode Island
summer program.

743
00:36:59,066 --> 00:37:00,734
This is not the Gabby
that I know.

744
00:37:00,867 --> 00:37:03,734
You're sleeping in class,
forgetting assignments...

745
00:37:03,867 --> 00:37:06,200
Do you want to realize
your potential?

746
00:37:06,333 --> 00:37:08,100
Or do you want to just
sit around Haney all summer?

747
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,333
Because the Gabby that I know

748
00:37:11,467 --> 00:37:12,800
wouldn't let
whatever's holding her back

749
00:37:12,934 --> 00:37:14,800
stop her
from doing what she loves.

750
00:37:17,133 --> 00:37:18,066
Okay?

751
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,500
Good.

752
00:37:43,633 --> 00:37:44,800
In use.

753
00:37:51,133 --> 00:37:52,133
Ms. Parker?

754
00:37:58,133 --> 00:37:59,300
Hello?

755
00:37:59,433 --> 00:38:01,300
Ms. Parker?

756
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,600
Is anyone there?

757
00:38:04,734 --> 00:38:06,300
You've got to be kidding me!

758
00:38:06,433 --> 00:38:07,934
Open the door, please!

759
00:38:08,066 --> 00:38:10,800
Please open it! Please!

760
00:38:10,934 --> 00:38:12,867
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

761
00:38:15,266 --> 00:38:16,800
Oh, my god...

762
00:38:16,934 --> 00:38:18,166
Oh, my god.

763
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,934
[Ms. Parker Gabby?

764
00:38:20,066 --> 00:38:21,533
Ms. Parker?

765
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,700
Ms. Parker?

766
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:25,200
Gabby?

767
00:38:28,934 --> 00:38:30,467
So, what are you saying?

768
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,500
Start an investigation
of our own?

769
00:38:32,633 --> 00:38:33,734
I know I can't continue
to feel like

770
00:38:33,867 --> 00:38:36,367
someone's preying on me
all the time.

771
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,567
Anyone in there can be Blake,

772
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,767
and all I'm saying is,

773
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,066
the three of us can figure out
a way to fight back.

774
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,166
Who says we should?

775
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:43,934
I mean, what if interfere
with Holland's investigation?

776
00:38:44,066 --> 00:38:44,934
We won't.

777
00:38:45,066 --> 00:38:46,266
Holland's on her own,

778
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,400
but she's not the one

779
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:48,900
who has to go to school
all the time.

780
00:38:49,033 --> 00:38:50,233
Aren't you guys tired

781
00:38:50,367 --> 00:38:52,333
of feeling like you have
no control over your life?

782
00:38:55,934 --> 00:38:57,467
Okay. I'm in.

783
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,667
Emma?

784
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,633
I'm out.

785
00:39:03,767 --> 00:39:07,433
What do you mean?
Blake could be any guy in there.

786
00:39:07,567 --> 00:39:09,133
What's the harm in figuring out
what we can?

787
00:39:09,266 --> 00:39:11,333
Running the risk
of him leaking worse things.

788
00:39:11,467 --> 00:39:13,133
What's worse
than leaking nudes,

789
00:39:13,266 --> 00:39:14,934
which by the way,
he might do anyways?

790
00:39:16,266 --> 00:39:18,133
Look, you guys do what you want,
but leave me out of it.

791
00:39:40,133 --> 00:39:41,600
Okay...

792
00:40:45,834 --> 00:40:47,533
Come on.
We need to go. Come on.

793
00:40:47,667 --> 00:40:48,834
Let's go home.

794
00:40:50,533 --> 00:40:51,533
Gabby.

795
00:40:51,667 --> 00:40:52,633
I want in.

796
00:40:52,767 --> 00:40:55,200
Whatever you guys have planned,
I want to do it.

797
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:57,166
Okay, you're kind of killing me
with the back and forth.

798
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,100
I know, I know.

799
00:40:58,233 --> 00:40:59,166
I'm sorry that I bailed.

800
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,467
I was just--
I was in my head about this.

801
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,066
But, Gabby, I am tired
of playing his games.

802
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,033
Okay, so you swear you're good?

803
00:41:07,066 --> 00:41:08,100
- Yeah.
- Okay, cool.

804
00:41:08,233 --> 00:41:09,333
Um, I'll tell Liv,

805
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,066
and then all we need
is more reinforcement.

806
00:41:13,633 --> 00:41:14,767
At first,

807
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,600
I thought it was someone
from school,

808
00:41:16,734 --> 00:41:18,166
'cause he seemed like
he knew me.

809
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,400
Like, sometimes, it felt like

810
00:41:21,533 --> 00:41:23,500
he knew where I was
or what I was doing.

811
00:41:25,266 --> 00:41:26,233
I was so freaked,

812
00:41:26,367 --> 00:41:28,200
I couldn't even
sleep alone anymore.

813
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:30,567
I really think we can help
if you're interested.

814
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,600
Hell, yeah,

815
00:41:32,734 --> 00:41:34,033
'cause it's not just me.

816
00:41:34,166 --> 00:41:37,000
Wait. Like,
you know more girls?

817
00:41:37,133 --> 00:41:38,000
A lot more.

818
00:41:38,133 --> 00:41:40,600
So whatever this thing is,

819
00:41:40,734 --> 00:41:41,800
I'm down to join.

820
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,834
Thanks.

821
00:41:44,967 --> 00:41:45,834
See ya.

822
00:41:45,967 --> 00:41:48,700
Yeah. Yeah, that's him.

823
00:41:49,767 --> 00:41:51,266
I tried telling
Principal Monroe about it.

824
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,433
but all she did

825
00:41:52,567 --> 00:41:54,500
was accuse me of being
reckless and irresponsible.

826
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,133
Trust us.
We get it.

827
00:41:57,266 --> 00:41:59,400
And we're sick of waiting
for something to be done.

828
00:42:01,133 --> 00:42:03,100
Whatever y'all are doing,
I'm in.

829
00:42:06,467 --> 00:42:07,867
Yes, I'm looking
for some information

830
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,834
on a device
registered to your company.

831
00:42:10,967 --> 00:42:12,433
Detective, you need to see
what's in the conference room.

832
00:42:13,533 --> 00:42:14,633
Let me call you back.

833
00:42:29,567 --> 00:42:31,200
These are the girls like us--

834
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:33,700
the girls who aren't willing

835
00:42:33,834 --> 00:42:35,600
to take any more shit
from Blake.

836
00:42:36,934 --> 00:42:37,967
I don't believe it.

837
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,033
How?

838
00:42:40,166 --> 00:42:41,734
We took our cue from you.

839
00:42:43,533 --> 00:42:45,867
They just needed
someone who would listen.

840
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,367
You know?

841
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,600
Someone who was real.

842
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,367
Emma.

843
00:43:13,734 --> 00:43:15,133
What's this?

844
00:43:15,266 --> 00:43:16,967
It's the rest
of my conversations.

845
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,133
With Blake.

846
00:43:21,834 --> 00:43:23,066
Come on in.

847
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:32,300
I'm sorry I didn't give you
everything sooner.

848
00:43:32,433 --> 00:43:33,433
That's okay,

849
00:43:33,567 --> 00:43:35,400
but why didn't you
give me these?

850
00:43:35,533 --> 00:43:36,734
Because I wasn't lying

851
00:43:36,867 --> 00:43:38,567
when I said I met him online.

852
00:43:40,166 --> 00:43:41,633
I just...

853
00:43:41,767 --> 00:43:42,700
I thought that the person

854
00:43:42,834 --> 00:43:45,300
that I was
in a relationship with

855
00:43:45,433 --> 00:43:47,233
was a girl.

856
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,367
I see.

857
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,900
And I figure...

858
00:43:56,033 --> 00:43:58,200
since there's so many of us now,

859
00:43:58,333 --> 00:44:00,433
and they all put themselves
on the line for me,

860
00:44:00,567 --> 00:44:01,934
I...

861
00:44:02,066 --> 00:44:03,300
I should do the same for them.

862
00:44:06,433 --> 00:44:08,467
And what's crazy
is I actually--

863
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,133
I thought that I could,

864
00:44:10,266 --> 00:44:11,800
like, live two lives.

865
00:44:14,066 --> 00:44:15,300
I could just be the real me.

866
00:44:16,433 --> 00:44:17,400
No one here ever had to know.

867
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,700
Now I just feel dumb.

868
00:44:21,834 --> 00:44:23,100
No.

869
00:44:23,233 --> 00:44:26,467
What's dumb is some jerk
posing on an LGBTQ site

870
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,800
trying to take advantage
of young girls.

871
00:44:30,133 --> 00:44:32,100
You should never
have to apologize

872
00:44:32,233 --> 00:44:33,433
for who you are.

873
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,200
Well, you're the only one
who seems to think that.

874
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,433
'Cause that's not the case...

875
00:44:42,567 --> 00:44:44,100
not here.

876
00:44:44,233 --> 00:44:46,967
The power you think people have
over you...

877
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,700
doesn't exist.

878
00:45:05,967 --> 00:45:07,533
Well, I'll be damned.

879
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,667
He's local.

880
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,667
What? What are you
talking about?

881
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:14,867
Here he is--

882
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,533
posing as a girl named Tiffany
to get close to Emma.

883
00:45:16,667 --> 00:45:18,834
When she figured out it's Blake,
she confronts him.

884
00:45:18,967 --> 00:45:20,667
Look at their exchange
at the end.

885
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,200
"If you don't tell me
who you are,

886
00:45:22,333 --> 00:45:23,333
I'll go to police."

887
00:45:23,467 --> 00:45:25,100
Tiffany: "Ha, you're dumber
than I thought

888
00:45:25,233 --> 00:45:26,233
if you think the police

889
00:45:26,367 --> 00:45:27,900
actually care about community,
honor, or service.

890
00:45:28,033 --> 00:45:29,266
Do it. I dare you."

891
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,400
What does any of this

892
00:45:30,533 --> 00:45:31,767
have to do with
a potential suspect from Haney?

893
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,700
"Community, honor, service."

894
00:45:33,834 --> 00:45:35,600
That's Haney's PD's mantra.

895
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:37,166
Who else would know that
unless you live here?

896
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:39,166
Blake is from Haney.

897
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:41,500
Detective. A word.

898
00:45:46,033 --> 00:45:47,600
We need to call the case.

899
00:45:47,734 --> 00:45:49,000
What?

900
00:45:49,133 --> 00:45:50,100
Says who?

901
00:45:51,033 --> 00:45:52,533
Says me.

902
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:54,433
And the pile of unfinished cases
that are on your desk.

903
00:45:54,567 --> 00:45:56,333
And the fact that it's been
weeks since this all started

904
00:45:56,467 --> 00:45:58,734
and you have nothing
to show for it.

905
00:45:58,867 --> 00:46:00,734
We just got a lead.

906
00:46:00,867 --> 00:46:02,934
Do you have a name?

907
00:46:03,066 --> 00:46:03,934
Right.

908
00:46:04,066 --> 00:46:05,500
I need you on other cases.

909
00:46:05,633 --> 00:46:07,433
Lieutenant, these girls
need me on this.

910
00:46:07,567 --> 00:46:09,166
Holland, we can't be there

911
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,467
for every he said-she said
teenage squabble

912
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,133
that happens online.

913
00:46:13,266 --> 00:46:14,967
Come in.

914
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:16,600
Sorry to interrupt.

915
00:46:16,734 --> 00:46:18,266
This came in for you, Detective.

916
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,367
Thank you.

917
00:46:22,033 --> 00:46:23,333
We're not shutting this down.

918
00:46:23,467 --> 00:46:24,967
Holland.

919
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:26,100
And there it is.

920
00:46:30,066 --> 00:46:30,967
I subpoenaed

921
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,000
as many call providers
as I could.

922
00:46:32,133 --> 00:46:33,900
All these names
are the real identities

923
00:46:34,033 --> 00:46:35,633
of people who are
legally registered

924
00:46:35,767 --> 00:46:37,166
to those numbers.

925
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,266
So our suspect could be

926
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,767
any one of the names
on this list?

927
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,633
Yes. But now we know
he's local.

928
00:46:42,767 --> 00:46:43,967
All we have to do

929
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:47,500
is find the person on the list
who lives in Haney.

930
00:46:47,633 --> 00:46:48,767
All right, find him.

931
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:01,066
- I got the names.
- Great.

932
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,867
The only name in Haney--

933
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,467
Nathan Reilly.

934
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:06,900
Got you.

935
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:14,567
Yes, ma'am.

936
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,000
I'm gonna send you over
my best guy.

937
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:18,734
You too.
You have a good day.

938
00:47:21,367 --> 00:47:22,367
Reilly.

939
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,567
Got a call for a repair.

940
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:54,500
Oh, good, you're here.

941
00:47:54,633 --> 00:47:56,033
A little late, but come on in.

942
00:47:56,166 --> 00:47:57,967
Okay, thanks.

943
00:48:04,467 --> 00:48:05,400
We have reason to believe

944
00:48:05,533 --> 00:48:07,800
Blake is a young man
named Nathan Reilly.

945
00:48:07,934 --> 00:48:09,133
He's 19 years old,

946
00:48:09,266 --> 00:48:10,700
he lives in Haney.

947
00:48:10,834 --> 00:48:13,333
He was actually a student
at Haney Regional.

948
00:48:13,467 --> 00:48:15,100
And the messages did come

949
00:48:15,233 --> 00:48:16,734
from devices
registered in his name.

950
00:48:16,867 --> 00:48:19,066
Serious?
I used to know him.

951
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,467
My dad was
his little league coach.

952
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,433
I thought he'd be,
like, an old man or something.

953
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:24,533
He was a senior
when we were freshmen.

954
00:48:24,667 --> 00:48:27,133
Girls, we have to keep this
under wraps.

955
00:48:27,266 --> 00:48:29,033
He cannot know
that we're on to him.

956
00:48:29,166 --> 00:48:30,133
Why?

957
00:48:30,266 --> 00:48:32,166
If you know who he is,
why can't you arrest him?

958
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:33,467
Because what we don't have

959
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,533
is proof that Nathan is actually

960
00:48:35,667 --> 00:48:38,266
the person
physically behind the screen.

961
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,433
Now, as much as I've pleaded,

962
00:48:39,567 --> 00:48:40,867
the judge refuses to believe

963
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,567
that we have enough evidence
to issue a warrant.

964
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:45,233
So we're stuck?

965
00:48:48,533 --> 00:48:50,367
There is another option.

966
00:48:52,033 --> 00:48:52,900
We wait.

967
00:48:53,033 --> 00:48:54,633
Wait for what?

968
00:48:54,767 --> 00:48:56,266
For the opportunity
to collect more evidence

969
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,567
that would actually prove

970
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,133
that Nathan is the guy

971
00:48:59,266 --> 00:49:01,633
that was harassing you as Blake.

972
00:49:01,767 --> 00:49:03,166
And once we have that,

973
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:05,066
we can bring charges against him

974
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,367
that would put him away
for years.

975
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:10,266
But that option
requires more time.

976
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,500
Well, how much more time?

977
00:49:11,633 --> 00:49:13,800
How much longer do we have
to put up with this?

978
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:16,700
It's hard to say.

979
00:49:16,834 --> 00:49:17,834
That is why I wanted

980
00:49:17,967 --> 00:49:19,367
the three of you

981
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,800
to have the opportunity
to decide.

982
00:49:24,233 --> 00:49:25,467
Take the weekend,

983
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,533
but either way,

984
00:49:26,667 --> 00:49:29,533
I will only wait
if the decision is unanimous.

985
00:50:21,367 --> 00:50:23,934
Hey, at least we now know
who it is.

986
00:50:24,066 --> 00:50:25,500
I guess.

987
00:50:25,633 --> 00:50:27,066
Guys, look, come on.

988
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,400
As obnoxious as it sounds,

989
00:50:28,533 --> 00:50:30,767
my dad's always talking about
finding the good in everything.

990
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:32,934
Which is what, exactly?

991
00:50:33,066 --> 00:50:35,066
Hello, the three of us.

992
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,667
We're still here
and we're still fighting.

993
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,767
Okay, you guys aren't
extremely terrible.

994
00:50:42,667 --> 00:50:43,800
To getting what's ours.

995
00:50:44,834 --> 00:50:45,934
Cheers.

996
00:50:47,033 --> 00:50:48,467
Cheers.

997
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:54,867
It's nothing.

998
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:58,033
Okay? It's from
a really long time ago.

999
00:50:58,166 --> 00:50:59,166
Okay.

1000
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:00,767
It's fine.

1001
00:51:03,467 --> 00:51:04,400
I've been taking pills.

1002
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:09,934
Not, like, all the time
or anything,

1003
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:11,400
but...

1004
00:51:11,533 --> 00:51:14,834
ever since
this whole Blake thing started,

1005
00:51:14,967 --> 00:51:16,800
I've been so anxious...

1006
00:51:16,934 --> 00:51:17,900
all the time.

1007
00:51:19,934 --> 00:51:23,734
My friend was saying about
how it'll calm you down,

1008
00:51:23,867 --> 00:51:25,900
just slow everything down.

1009
00:51:26,033 --> 00:51:28,233
So, you know, I tried it.

1010
00:51:34,367 --> 00:51:35,467
Um...

1011
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,166
well, this is weird,

1012
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:39,633
but...

1013
00:51:39,767 --> 00:51:43,767
I can't actually remember
the last time I slept at night.

1014
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,033
Properly.

1015
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:48,533
Without having a panic attack
or a night terror.

1016
00:51:50,433 --> 00:51:51,633
It just feels like

1017
00:51:51,767 --> 00:51:54,033
being paranoid
is my new life now.

1018
00:51:56,467 --> 00:51:58,000
You guys aren't
the only ones struggling.

1019
00:52:06,233 --> 00:52:08,333
But we have each other now.

1020
00:52:08,467 --> 00:52:09,467
Right?

1021
00:52:11,233 --> 00:52:12,300
Right.

1022
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:14,734
Right.

1023
00:53:06,533 --> 00:53:07,633
Oh, my--

1024
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:09,133
What are you doing?

1025
00:53:10,333 --> 00:53:11,333
You ready to head back?

1026
00:53:12,834 --> 00:53:14,033
Yeah. Yeah.

1027
00:53:14,166 --> 00:53:15,333
Okay, let's go.

1028
00:53:16,233 --> 00:53:17,600
Thank you so much for coming.

1029
00:53:17,734 --> 00:53:18,600
I hope you enjoyed it.

1030
00:53:18,734 --> 00:53:20,467
Yes. God bless.

1031
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:21,533
Thank you so much for coming.

1032
00:53:21,667 --> 00:53:23,300
See you next week.

1033
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:25,867
- Hi. Thank you.
- Thank you for speaking.

1034
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,266
Thank you so much.

1035
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,567
Oh, could you go see
who that is?

1036
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:29,567
- I got it.
- Thank you.

1037
00:53:32,934 --> 00:53:34,600
Good morning.
Haney Baptist Church.

1038
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,800
- Hello?
- <i>Knock-knock.</i>

1039
00:53:43,567 --> 00:53:44,767
Who is this?

1040
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:46,467
<i>A sinner.
Like you.</i>

1041
00:53:55,567 --> 00:53:56,433
Emma.

1042
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:57,734
I've been calling for you.

1043
00:53:57,867 --> 00:53:59,467
I need you to get the extra box
of nails from the back

1044
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:00,600
and then take over
at the register.

1045
00:54:00,734 --> 00:54:02,600
I gotta help a customer
load up outside.

1046
00:54:02,734 --> 00:54:03,600
Of course.

1047
00:54:03,734 --> 00:54:05,133
Sorry.

1048
00:54:41,133 --> 00:54:42,100
Can I help you?

1049
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:44,867
No.

1050
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,300
I don't think so.

1051
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,200
Emma, hey.

1052
00:55:11,333 --> 00:55:13,433
We made a decision.

1053
00:55:13,567 --> 00:55:15,567
We're done with his games.

1054
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:18,000
We're done with
Nathan controlling our lives.

1055
00:55:18,133 --> 00:55:19,500
<i>He came to my work</i>

1056
00:55:19,633 --> 00:55:21,734
<i>and followed me
through the store.</i>

1057
00:55:21,867 --> 00:55:23,600
All right.
I'll make the arrest.

1058
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:26,400
No.

1059
00:55:26,533 --> 00:55:30,900
No, that is why we want you
to find everything you can...

1060
00:55:31,033 --> 00:55:32,800
and we want you
to bury him for good.

1061
00:55:35,033 --> 00:55:37,033
You've got my word.

1062
00:55:37,166 --> 00:55:38,233
I wonder how long it'll be

1063
00:55:38,367 --> 00:55:40,100
until that squirmy asshole
gets what's coming to him.

1064
00:55:40,233 --> 00:55:41,934
Honestly, a huge part of me

1065
00:55:42,066 --> 00:55:43,000
wanted it to be us
who found him,

1066
00:55:43,133 --> 00:55:45,433
just so I could go
Ronda Rousey on his ass.

1067
00:55:45,567 --> 00:55:46,600
Lord knows
we've tried everything

1068
00:55:46,734 --> 00:55:50,033
short of being on
that new catfish show on TV.

1069
00:55:50,166 --> 00:55:51,000
Speaking of which,

1070
00:55:51,133 --> 00:55:52,166
I guess there's no need

1071
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:53,767
for that fake profile
we tried to make.

1072
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:55,567
Guess not.

1073
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:56,867
Wanna do the honors?

1074
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,200
Yeah.

1075
00:55:59,233 --> 00:56:00,367
Okay...

1076
00:56:08,734 --> 00:56:10,900
Do you guys remember
the password we made for this?

1077
00:56:11,033 --> 00:56:12,500
I have no clue.

1078
00:56:12,633 --> 00:56:13,900
Just answer
the security questions.

1079
00:56:14,033 --> 00:56:15,266
Right.

1080
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,166
Um, okay,

1081
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:19,600
Gabby, what was the name
of your first dog?

1082
00:56:19,734 --> 00:56:21,066
Pepper.

1083
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,834
I'm just a little bit offended
that you forgot, but...

1084
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:26,900
Okay, um...

1085
00:56:27,033 --> 00:56:28,300
Pepper.

1086
00:56:28,433 --> 00:56:30,266
And, Liv,

1087
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,233
what was your favorite
childhood book?

1088
00:56:33,367 --> 00:56:34,767
I mean, really, Emma,
do you even know us at all?

1089
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,000
It's embarrassing.

1090
00:56:42,734 --> 00:56:44,433
Oh, my god.

1091
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:45,834
You guys, that's how he did it.

1092
00:56:46,867 --> 00:56:47,834
Did what?

1093
00:56:51,166 --> 00:56:52,533
Nathan knows this town.

1094
00:56:53,633 --> 00:56:55,033
He knows us
like the back of his hand.

1095
00:56:55,166 --> 00:56:57,734
What if he's been able
to hack into our accounts

1096
00:56:57,867 --> 00:57:00,166
by correctly answering
the security questions

1097
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:01,633
and guessing the passwords?

1098
00:57:02,834 --> 00:57:03,700
I mean, how many times

1099
00:57:03,834 --> 00:57:06,467
has he asked us about
our favorite color,

1100
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:07,467
or the music we're into,

1101
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:08,900
or childhood memories?

1102
00:57:10,066 --> 00:57:11,066
This has to be
how he's doing it.

1103
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,033
Yeah, but every time?

1104
00:57:13,166 --> 00:57:15,367
We've all had to set up
new questions

1105
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,467
for every time we set up
a brand-new account.

1106
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:18,567
I mean, sometimes,

1107
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:20,400
I've even created
fake answers to those questions

1108
00:57:20,533 --> 00:57:22,066
just to be safe.

1109
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,400
How did he find that out?

1110
00:57:24,467 --> 00:57:25,934
I don't know. But how else
could he have done it?

1111
00:57:27,633 --> 00:57:29,400
But the door swings
both ways, doesn't it?

1112
00:57:29,533 --> 00:57:30,567
I mean, we know him.

1113
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:32,700
Yeah, so?

1114
00:57:32,834 --> 00:57:34,367
And now we know that Blake
is really Nathan,

1115
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,000
so we know a lot of stuff
about him--

1116
00:57:36,133 --> 00:57:38,166
and we've picked up a lot
during our conversations.

1117
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:43,367
If you're thinking
what I'm thinking...

1118
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,700
I'm thinking if we have to wait
months for justice,

1119
00:57:45,834 --> 00:57:47,834
who says we can't give him
a taste of his own medicine?

1120
00:57:56,834 --> 00:57:57,700
<i>What do we say?</i>

1121
00:57:57,834 --> 00:57:59,300
I don't know.

1122
00:57:59,433 --> 00:58:00,567
Oh, okay, um...

1123
00:58:03,734 --> 00:58:05,133
Should we just say
"bippity-boppity-bitch"?

1124
00:58:05,266 --> 00:58:06,233
Bippity-boppity-bitch?

1125
00:58:08,834 --> 00:58:09,734
It needs to be,
like, suspenseful.

1126
00:58:09,867 --> 00:58:11,533
- Right.
- Uh-huh.

1127
00:58:11,667 --> 00:58:13,467
Payback...

1128
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:14,467
Is a bitch.

1129
00:58:19,433 --> 00:58:20,567
Payback is a bitch.

1130
00:58:26,133 --> 00:58:27,433
Wouldn't you like to know?

1131
00:58:30,233 --> 00:58:32,800
How does it feel to know
that I'm smarter than you?

1132
00:58:32,934 --> 00:58:34,700
- Smarter than you.
- Smarter than you.

1133
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:42,900
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

1134
00:58:43,033 --> 00:58:44,033
Good luck.

1135
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,433
Olivia, come in here, please.

1136
00:59:09,367 --> 00:59:10,767
I got a call from Mrs. Morgan.

1137
00:59:13,166 --> 00:59:15,600
She told me she was missing
medication from her bathroom.

1138
00:59:17,967 --> 00:59:19,266
Olivia Carter, look at me.

1139
00:59:20,367 --> 00:59:22,367
I almost went to town
on this woman

1140
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,867
at the nerve of her
suggesting you took them.

1141
00:59:27,734 --> 00:59:29,500
And then...

1142
00:59:29,633 --> 00:59:30,667
I found these.

1143
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,033
Are you out of your mind?

1144
00:59:34,166 --> 00:59:37,367
What could possibly compel you
to sell pills?

1145
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:41,834
I'm not selling.
I'm taking them.

1146
00:59:48,467 --> 00:59:51,533
I mean, I was taking them...

1147
00:59:51,667 --> 00:59:53,200
to calm my anxiety.

1148
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:56,700
It's no excuse,

1149
00:59:56,834 --> 00:59:57,867
but...

1150
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,533
I was stressed all the time,

1151
01:00:00,667 --> 01:00:02,266
and I couldn't
talk to you about it.

1152
01:00:05,667 --> 01:00:07,033
I couldn't tell you
what was going on.

1153
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:09,633
What do you mean?

1154
01:00:09,767 --> 01:00:10,800
What's going on?

1155
01:00:16,734 --> 01:00:18,767
Just school.

1156
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,100
These AP classes.

1157
01:00:23,033 --> 01:00:24,200
I promise I'm not
taking them anymore.

1158
01:00:24,333 --> 01:00:25,600
You're damn right you're not.

1159
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,433
Nor will you continue to lie
under this roof.

1160
01:00:30,467 --> 01:00:32,133
Do you understand
how dangerous this is?

1161
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,867
Every time
you took one of these

1162
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,266
was a gamble.

1163
01:00:37,734 --> 01:00:39,433
I just don't want anything
to happen to you.

1164
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:42,266
I know.

1165
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:45,333
I'm sorry.

1166
01:00:49,633 --> 01:00:50,767
Nathan.

1167
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,000
Get in here.

1168
01:00:55,367 --> 01:00:56,667
Take a seat.

1169
01:01:06,567 --> 01:01:08,500
There's no need to beat around
the bush on this.

1170
01:01:08,633 --> 01:01:09,900
I'm letting you go.

1171
01:01:11,734 --> 01:01:12,500
Why?

1172
01:01:12,633 --> 01:01:14,967
I've gotten calls from clients.

1173
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:16,133
You show up late,

1174
01:01:16,266 --> 01:01:17,734
you go missing
for periods of time.

1175
01:01:17,867 --> 01:01:19,000
I'm willing to overlook
all of that

1176
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:20,967
because you're
the best guy I got,

1177
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:22,333
but...

1178
01:01:25,367 --> 01:01:26,567
then there's this.

1179
01:01:28,934 --> 01:01:30,300
Our customers
need to be able to trust

1180
01:01:30,433 --> 01:01:32,133
my guys that I send
to their homes,

1181
01:01:32,266 --> 01:01:35,567
so I'm gonna ask you
to clean out your cubby.

1182
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:38,400
What?
I didn't write this.

1183
01:01:38,533 --> 01:01:39,734
You know I need this job.

1184
01:01:39,867 --> 01:01:40,734
Yeah...

1185
01:01:40,867 --> 01:01:42,100
it's just not gonna work.

1186
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:44,433
That's a week's pay,

1187
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:46,200
including the full workday
for today.

1188
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,033
Holland.

1189
01:02:39,166 --> 01:02:40,233
It's time.

1190
01:02:40,367 --> 01:02:41,567
I'm not done with this.

1191
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:42,800
Then make an arrest
and you will be.

1192
01:02:42,934 --> 01:02:44,066
We got another case.

1193
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,767
Emma Lawrence.

1194
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:48,867
Who?

1195
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,934
Emma Lawrence
was sitting right out there.

1196
01:02:53,467 --> 01:02:54,700
Just sitting and waiting,

1197
01:02:54,834 --> 01:02:57,066
and everybody went by her
as if she was invisible.

1198
01:02:58,533 --> 01:02:59,400
We can't do this to them.

1199
01:02:59,533 --> 01:03:01,300
They deserve better from us.

1200
01:03:01,433 --> 01:03:02,700
June. Make an arrest.

1201
01:03:02,834 --> 01:03:04,633
Close the case.

1202
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:08,266
- Detective.
- Taking a five.

1203
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:09,533
No, June.

1204
01:03:09,667 --> 01:03:10,934
The subpoena files for Reilly.

1205
01:03:11,066 --> 01:03:12,033
They're here.

1206
01:03:18,367 --> 01:03:20,533
Sam, I hope you know
how grateful I am for you.

1207
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:23,600
We have to go through
all of these, don't we?

1208
01:03:23,734 --> 01:03:25,066
Every single one.

1209
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,266
Facebook, Amazon, Skype,

1210
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,200
AOL, Google.

1211
01:03:29,333 --> 01:03:31,567
Our best chance to prove
that Nathan is guilty

1212
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:33,400
is in one of these boxes.

1213
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:35,533
Except first,

1214
01:03:35,667 --> 01:03:36,633
we just have to sort
through each file,

1215
01:03:36,767 --> 01:03:38,400
match his IP address
to time and date stamps,

1216
01:03:38,533 --> 01:03:40,233
then match that
to his location information,

1217
01:03:40,367 --> 01:03:41,233
and hope to God

1218
01:03:41,367 --> 01:03:42,900
there's a connection
to his whereabouts?

1219
01:03:43,033 --> 01:03:44,300
Yeah.

1220
01:03:44,433 --> 01:03:45,533
Oh.

1221
01:03:45,667 --> 01:03:47,033
Let's get to work.
Let's go.

1222
01:04:04,667 --> 01:04:06,500
What is it
that he's trying to say...

1223
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:09,033
...with the jungle?

1224
01:04:09,166 --> 01:04:10,667
Because that really is
what the <i>Heart of Darkness</i> is.

1225
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,266
What is that?

1226
01:04:15,667 --> 01:04:17,300
So embarrassing.

1227
01:04:17,433 --> 01:04:19,133
Hey, isn't this you?

1228
01:04:22,233 --> 01:04:24,266
What does
the heart of darkness represent?

1229
01:04:26,133 --> 01:04:27,967
What is its meaning?

1230
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:29,066
What does the jungle mean?

1231
01:04:59,133 --> 01:05:00,333
Watch it, dyke.

1232
01:05:25,633 --> 01:05:26,667
Detective Holland.

1233
01:05:29,133 --> 01:05:30,133
What?

1234
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:33,867
Got it.

1235
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,033
I need hands!

1236
01:05:35,166 --> 01:05:36,567
What's wrong?

1237
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:39,166
Nathan just released everything
on Emma, Gabby, and Olivia.

1238
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:41,600
As far as I'm concerned,

1239
01:05:41,734 --> 01:05:43,100
he went from misdemeanor
to a felony

1240
01:05:43,233 --> 01:05:45,066
for distribution
of underage pornography.

1241
01:05:46,233 --> 01:05:47,333
I want his ass now!

1242
01:05:50,767 --> 01:05:51,700
I tried to tell you guys.

1243
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,533
I did, I just--
I didn't know how.

1244
01:05:58,066 --> 01:05:59,600
Our phone
is ringing off the hook.

1245
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:02,433
The church inbox
is flooded with emails,

1246
01:06:02,567 --> 01:06:04,700
and now the assistant pastor
has to take over.

1247
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:07,934
We raised you to be truthful.

1248
01:06:08,066 --> 01:06:10,133
But not about stuff like this.

1249
01:06:11,166 --> 01:06:12,367
When you're
the preacher's daughter,

1250
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:14,433
how can you expect
to be an example on this town

1251
01:06:14,567 --> 01:06:16,500
if their child is involved
in something like this?

1252
01:06:16,633 --> 01:06:18,767
We don't care about this town,

1253
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:20,500
we care about you, Liv!

1254
01:06:24,033 --> 01:06:25,467
I'm sorry.

1255
01:06:28,734 --> 01:06:31,734
But you also raised me
to use my voice

1256
01:06:31,867 --> 01:06:32,934
and fight for myself,

1257
01:06:33,066 --> 01:06:35,133
and that's what
I was trying to do.

1258
01:06:35,266 --> 01:06:36,233
I was the first
to say something.

1259
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:37,734
I was the first
to go to the police.

1260
01:06:37,867 --> 01:06:40,100
And we're proud of you
for that.

1261
01:06:40,233 --> 01:06:42,767
But it's our job
to fight for our daughter--

1262
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:44,700
and we couldn't do that

1263
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:46,867
because you lied
and kept things from us.

1264
01:06:53,367 --> 01:06:54,800
Dad...

1265
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,200
Say something.

1266
01:07:10,133 --> 01:07:12,400
Gabby.

1267
01:07:23,433 --> 01:07:24,867
Okay.

1268
01:07:25,967 --> 01:07:27,100
It's okay.

1269
01:07:29,033 --> 01:07:30,433
Okay. Okay.

1270
01:07:30,567 --> 01:07:31,967
We understand.
Thanks, Holland.

1271
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:34,200
Holland said
they have Nathan in questioning.

1272
01:07:36,367 --> 01:07:37,500
Good.

1273
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:40,834
I can't believe my dad
let me out tonight.

1274
01:07:42,066 --> 01:07:43,567
My dad won't even talk to me.

1275
01:07:44,867 --> 01:07:47,266
But, honestly,
we should be out tonight.

1276
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:48,600
We can't let this stop us.

1277
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,467
What about Emma?
Has she said anything?

1278
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,100
I don't know.
I'll check.

1279
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,266
No, nothing.

1280
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:00,800
That doesn't make sense.

1281
01:08:00,934 --> 01:08:01,800
She's always on time.

1282
01:08:01,934 --> 01:08:03,467
I know.

1283
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,467
Do you think something's wrong?

1284
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:09,967
Yeah. We should go.

1285
01:08:33,867 --> 01:08:37,266
Oh, no, no!
Oh, my god, oh, my god.

1286
01:08:50,433 --> 01:08:53,000
I missed
every single one of these.

1287
01:09:02,066 --> 01:09:03,367
Hi.

1288
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:04,367
Mom...

1289
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:06,000
Hi, baby.

1290
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:10,700
I didn't...

1291
01:09:10,834 --> 01:09:12,967
I wasn't--
I wasn't trying to kill myself.

1292
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:14,467
It's okay.

1293
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:16,467
You don't have to explain.

1294
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:20,033
No, I do.
I want to.

1295
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,133
I needed something,

1296
01:09:24,266 --> 01:09:27,734
anything, to distract me
from what was going on.

1297
01:09:27,867 --> 01:09:31,433
And then it just
kept happening again,

1298
01:09:31,567 --> 01:09:33,900
and I just...

1299
01:09:34,033 --> 01:09:35,533
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

1300
01:09:35,667 --> 01:09:36,533
Nothing.

1301
01:09:36,667 --> 01:09:39,066
There is nothing wrong with you.

1302
01:09:45,934 --> 01:09:48,066
I've been sitting here,

1303
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:52,567
trying to think of
what I was gonna say,

1304
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:54,600
and what all I wanted to say,

1305
01:09:54,734 --> 01:09:57,600
and...

1306
01:09:57,734 --> 01:09:58,700
I just kept thinking about

1307
01:09:58,834 --> 01:10:00,233
when you were learning
how to walk.

1308
01:10:01,934 --> 01:10:05,367
You were
such a determined baby.

1309
01:10:07,166 --> 01:10:08,533
You know, every few steps,

1310
01:10:08,667 --> 01:10:11,033
you'd fall right back down,

1311
01:10:11,166 --> 01:10:12,900
but for hours,

1312
01:10:13,033 --> 01:10:16,367
you'd just pick yourself up
as though nothing even happened.

1313
01:10:17,867 --> 01:10:19,300
And I said to myself...

1314
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:23,567
I am so lucky.

1315
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:28,533
My little girl is so strong,

1316
01:10:28,667 --> 01:10:30,367
and so tough.

1317
01:10:33,233 --> 01:10:35,800
And somewhere,
I took that for granted,

1318
01:10:35,934 --> 01:10:37,033
and I'm sorry.

1319
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,100
Oh, baby.

1320
01:10:40,233 --> 01:10:41,967
It's gonna be okay...

1321
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:43,533
It's gonna be okay.

1322
01:10:47,767 --> 01:10:49,100
Tell me about Blake.

1323
01:10:49,233 --> 01:10:50,734
Don't know who that is.

1324
01:10:51,934 --> 01:10:52,900
Sure, you do.

1325
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,266
Why'd you create the profile?

1326
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:57,734
What profile?

1327
01:10:57,867 --> 01:11:00,467
The one you use to befriend
and manipulate the girls

1328
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:02,333
into giving you
personal information

1329
01:11:02,467 --> 01:11:04,967
so you can hack
into their account

1330
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:06,400
and use it as blackmail.

1331
01:11:09,633 --> 01:11:10,934
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1332
01:11:11,066 --> 01:11:12,300
Is that so?

1333
01:11:12,433 --> 01:11:14,834
Because with
all the evidence we have,

1334
01:11:14,967 --> 01:11:18,300
you're liable to be charged
with interstate threats,

1335
01:11:18,433 --> 01:11:19,667
aggravated identity theft,

1336
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:21,133
computer fraud,

1337
01:11:21,266 --> 01:11:24,300
and, oh, let's not forget,
child pornography.

1338
01:11:25,467 --> 01:11:26,467
That's a whole lot.

1339
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:31,133
Anything coming back to you?

1340
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:34,467
Let's talk about Mr. Richardson.

1341
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:35,900
That's your neighbor, right?

1342
01:11:37,133 --> 01:11:38,867
And there's also Carol,

1343
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,266
your sister's neighbor.

1344
01:11:41,667 --> 01:11:45,834
We know that Blake
uses all their wifi

1345
01:11:45,967 --> 01:11:47,633
when interacting
with the girls online.

1346
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:51,000
That's an awfully
weird coincidence

1347
01:11:51,133 --> 01:11:54,500
that they all have
a connection to you,

1348
01:11:54,633 --> 01:11:55,900
don't you think?

1349
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:00,834
You can make this
easier on yourself.

1350
01:12:04,033 --> 01:12:05,266
You've got the wrong guy.

1351
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:08,467
We'll see about that.

1352
01:12:21,367 --> 01:12:23,033
Please tell me
you got something on his phone.

1353
01:12:23,166 --> 01:12:24,900
He wiped everything.

1354
01:12:25,033 --> 01:12:27,834
No messages, no search history.

1355
01:12:27,967 --> 01:12:29,767
He knew we were coming.

1356
01:12:38,367 --> 01:12:40,333
Ta-dah!

1357
01:12:40,467 --> 01:12:41,400
Your one tomato, Dad?

1358
01:12:41,533 --> 01:12:43,834
Really, you shouldn't have.

1359
01:12:43,967 --> 01:12:45,066
Woulda had more

1360
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:47,033
if those squirrels
hadn't ravished the rest.

1361
01:12:47,166 --> 01:12:48,934
So we'll make do.

1362
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:58,100
That is one damn good tomato.

1363
01:12:58,233 --> 01:12:59,667
Indeed.

1364
01:13:02,967 --> 01:13:04,600
I was hoping to put
a smile on your face.

1365
01:13:07,367 --> 01:13:09,100
I can't pin this one
on him, Dad.

1366
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:14,166
I just want these girls
to finally have some peace.

1367
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:15,767
You'll get him.

1368
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:17,367
You always do.

1369
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:22,967
So, I wanted to capture
the young women of Haney,

1370
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:25,166
and, you know,
like, the real of it.

1371
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:27,400
So, it's different for everyone,

1372
01:13:27,533 --> 01:13:29,166
but it's beautiful.

1373
01:13:31,433 --> 01:13:32,800
Oh...

1374
01:13:32,934 --> 01:13:34,066
spectacular, Gabby.

1375
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:36,967
Oh, I like this one.

1376
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:38,233
This one's my favorite.

1377
01:13:38,367 --> 01:13:39,633
This is beautiful.

1378
01:13:39,767 --> 01:13:40,934
Look at you.

1379
01:13:41,066 --> 01:13:43,734
<i>Yeah, it feels good to be home.</i>

1380
01:13:43,867 --> 01:13:46,333
<i>But I just wanted to say
thank you, guys,</i>

1381
01:13:46,467 --> 01:13:47,400
<i>you know,</i>

1382
01:13:47,533 --> 01:13:49,000
<i>for being there.</i>

1383
01:13:50,033 --> 01:13:51,266
Yeah, of course.

1384
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:54,667
Um, I think I'm gonna come
check in on you tomorrow.

1385
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,367
I'll see you then, okay?

1386
01:13:57,567 --> 01:13:59,266
'Kay, bye. Love you. <i>- Love you.</i>

1387
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,967
<i>Put your phone down, Gabby.</i>

1388
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,300
<i>You don't know
who you've messed with.</i>

1389
01:14:51,433 --> 01:14:52,500
<i>I told you before.</i>

1390
01:14:52,633 --> 01:14:54,633
<i>I will always own you.</i>

1391
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:58,367
So, I panicked,

1392
01:14:58,500 --> 01:14:59,567
and then I deleted my account,

1393
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:01,900
and then
that's when he spoke to me.

1394
01:15:02,033 --> 01:15:03,867
It has to be him.

1395
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,734
That sounds like a virus
or some type of malware,

1396
01:15:05,867 --> 01:15:06,734
but it just--
it doesn't make any sense,

1397
01:15:06,867 --> 01:15:08,200
because when the heck
would he...?

1398
01:15:08,333 --> 01:15:10,100
Wait, go back to the beginning.

1399
01:15:10,233 --> 01:15:11,100
Which beginning?

1400
01:15:11,233 --> 01:15:13,000
The first time
your Facebook was hacked.

1401
01:15:13,133 --> 01:15:15,133
Take me step by step.
What happened?

1402
01:15:15,266 --> 01:15:16,767
So, once I realized
he hacked my account,

1403
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:18,400
I messaged
the privacy support team

1404
01:15:18,533 --> 01:15:19,467
to report it,

1405
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:20,600
and then I deleted my account.

1406
01:15:20,734 --> 01:15:21,734
And then a few hours later,

1407
01:15:21,867 --> 01:15:22,934
they emailed me this link

1408
01:15:23,066 --> 01:15:24,867
to redownload the app
before creating a new profile.

1409
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:25,867
Yeah, same here.

1410
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,300
Yeah, me too.

1411
01:15:27,433 --> 01:15:29,333
I mean, that's--
that's what I did.

1412
01:16:07,166 --> 01:16:08,600
We got played.

1413
01:16:08,734 --> 01:16:09,867
What do you mean?

1414
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,433
Nathan hacking
their social medias

1415
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:14,667
was only a portion of his move.

1416
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,367
He didn't just hack
their profiles.

1417
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:18,800
He hacked your entire devices.

1418
01:16:18,934 --> 01:16:22,200
There are different ways
hackers can take over a device,

1419
01:16:22,333 --> 01:16:24,367
and one of those ways
is phishing.

1420
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:27,600
They send out a fake email
masquerading as legitimate

1421
01:16:27,734 --> 01:16:28,667
with the purpose

1422
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:29,934
of getting you
to click on a link.

1423
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:33,300
And when you do,
a malware is installed.

1424
01:16:33,433 --> 01:16:36,433
It gives them complete access
to all of your data

1425
01:16:36,567 --> 01:16:37,533
and the entire device.

1426
01:16:37,667 --> 01:16:41,300
Microphone, cameras,
stored data,

1427
01:16:41,433 --> 01:16:43,500
everything.

1428
01:16:43,633 --> 01:16:45,533
Facebook didn't send you guys
that email.

1429
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:46,767
That was Nathan.

1430
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:49,467
He knew that
if he masqueraded himself

1431
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,633
as a security member
of the Facebook team...

1432
01:16:53,767 --> 01:16:55,300
...you'd trust it
and click on the link.

1433
01:16:58,333 --> 01:16:59,367
So what do we do?

1434
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:08,333
I thought we seized
all of his devices.

1435
01:17:08,467 --> 01:17:09,900
We did.

1436
01:17:10,033 --> 01:17:11,000
Unless he's using another one.

1437
01:17:11,133 --> 01:17:12,400
One that we didn't know existed.

1438
01:17:12,533 --> 01:17:13,767
But how do we find him?

1439
01:17:15,033 --> 01:17:16,033
There is one way.

1440
01:17:16,166 --> 01:17:17,066
I'm gonna need the list

1441
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:18,700
of local IP addresses
we ruled out before.

1442
01:17:18,834 --> 01:17:20,100
If he is still in Haney,

1443
01:17:20,233 --> 01:17:21,200
the chance that he's using

1444
01:17:21,333 --> 01:17:23,600
one of the same wifis
as before is high.

1445
01:17:23,734 --> 01:17:24,433
If that's the case,

1446
01:17:24,567 --> 01:17:25,433
I'm betting

1447
01:17:25,567 --> 01:17:27,033
one of those local
IP addresses we ruled out

1448
01:17:27,166 --> 01:17:29,233
belongs to a device
we didn't even know existed,

1449
01:17:29,367 --> 01:17:31,367
like a secondary phone
or a laptop.

1450
01:17:32,467 --> 01:17:33,433
Got it.

1451
01:17:35,834 --> 01:17:37,133
Tracking him now.

1452
01:17:38,166 --> 01:17:39,000
- Got him!
- That's gotta be it.

1453
01:17:39,133 --> 01:17:40,400
- I need a team!
- I'm on it.

1454
01:17:40,533 --> 01:17:41,734
Keep tracking him.

1455
01:17:41,867 --> 01:17:42,867
Yeah, you bet.

1456
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:04,000
Hey, are you still
getting the signal?

1457
01:18:04,133 --> 01:18:05,266
It's still
coming from the house,

1458
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:06,467
but I don't know
how long that will last.

1459
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:08,100
Just get there. <i>- I'm on it.</i>

1460
01:18:08,233 --> 01:18:09,300
All this time,

1461
01:18:09,433 --> 01:18:11,100
he was keeping track of us
like the back of his hand.

1462
01:18:11,233 --> 01:18:13,433
Our conversations,
our whereabouts,

1463
01:18:13,567 --> 01:18:14,433
all of it.

1464
01:18:14,567 --> 01:18:16,567
He was spying on us
like animals.

1465
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:19,100
I just really hope

1466
01:18:19,233 --> 01:18:20,500
Detective Holland
puts an end to all of this.

1467
01:18:20,633 --> 01:18:21,600
She will.

1468
01:18:22,633 --> 01:18:23,467
She has to.

1469
01:18:43,233 --> 01:18:44,066
Haney PD, open up!

1470
01:18:53,767 --> 01:18:54,900
Sweep the main floor.
I'm going up!

1471
01:19:08,266 --> 01:19:09,667
The rest
of the house is clear.

1472
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,133
It's like nobody lives here.

1473
01:19:14,266 --> 01:19:15,600
Where the hell could he be?

1474
01:19:20,367 --> 01:19:21,300
He's not here!

1475
01:19:21,433 --> 01:19:22,633
What?

1476
01:19:22,767 --> 01:19:25,066
He's rerouting his IP address
off of multiple servers at once.

1477
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:26,467
What?

1478
01:19:28,066 --> 01:19:29,300
He must've found a way
to signal his location

1479
01:19:29,433 --> 01:19:31,233
off of different servers
as a decoy.

1480
01:19:31,367 --> 01:19:34,467
<i>He's manipulating the grid
to camouflage his true location.</i>

1481
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:36,066
I've got to see
if I can track him.

1482
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:37,633
He's trying to run.

1483
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:40,066
Set up a perimeter.

1484
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:41,133
No one is leaving town

1485
01:19:41,266 --> 01:19:42,567
until they go through
a checkpoint.

1486
01:19:59,133 --> 01:20:01,133
<i>This is a person who would hide
and be on the defense</i>

1487
01:20:01,266 --> 01:20:02,633
<i>rather than the offense,</i>

1488
01:20:02,767 --> 01:20:04,266
<i>but if you look hard enough,</i>

1489
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,200
<i>they're usually hiding
right under your nose.</i>

1490
01:21:12,567 --> 01:21:13,834
Stop the car!

1491
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:21,233
Hands behind your head!

1492
01:21:29,633 --> 01:21:31,633
It's over!

1493
01:21:31,767 --> 01:21:33,367
He wiped
all of his drives ahead of time,

1494
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:35,166
so his computer
didn't give us much ammo.

1495
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:36,867
We've just gotta wait
on the FBI crime labs,

1496
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,800
and, hopefully,
they can dig deeper.

1497
01:21:39,834 --> 01:21:40,700
Let's hope he's got

1498
01:21:40,834 --> 01:21:42,000
another device
hidden here somewhere.

1499
01:21:42,133 --> 01:21:45,066
So no phone, no tablet,
no flashdrives, no nothing?

1500
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:48,033
We have to find
something to hold him

1501
01:21:48,166 --> 01:21:49,633
and prove
he violated the court orders

1502
01:21:49,767 --> 01:21:51,266
and contacted the girls.

1503
01:21:53,300 --> 01:21:55,567
There's a crack
in this gaming console.

1504
01:21:58,066 --> 01:21:59,266
There's something in here.

1505
01:22:09,367 --> 01:22:10,700
Oh...

1506
01:22:10,834 --> 01:22:12,033
We got him.

1507
01:22:16,166 --> 01:22:17,066
We got him.

1508
01:22:47,633 --> 01:22:48,767
Ms. Emma Lawrence,

1509
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:50,233
would you please
come up to the stand

1510
01:22:50,367 --> 01:22:52,400
and read
your victim-impact statement?

1511
01:23:10,867 --> 01:23:14,533
I didn't exactly know
what I would say coming up here.

1512
01:23:17,367 --> 01:23:18,433
But I'm here.

1513
01:23:19,867 --> 01:23:21,000
And I'm still standing.

1514
01:23:22,967 --> 01:23:27,233
There was a time
when I wished I was invisible,

1515
01:23:27,367 --> 01:23:31,066
when I felt so small
that I just wanted to disappear.

1516
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:34,166
But I'm standing here

1517
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:37,367
because I want everyone
to see me for who I am...

1518
01:23:40,033 --> 01:23:41,767
...a daughter,

1519
01:23:41,900 --> 01:23:44,166
a sister,

1520
01:23:44,300 --> 01:23:46,433
a fighter.

1521
01:23:46,567 --> 01:23:47,767
Not your victim.

1522
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:51,100
The truth is,

1523
01:23:51,233 --> 01:23:55,500
I learned who I was
throughout all of this.

1524
01:23:55,633 --> 01:23:58,166
You tried to break me,

1525
01:23:58,300 --> 01:23:59,367
but I became stronger.

1526
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:03,800
You tried to silence me,

1527
01:24:03,934 --> 01:24:06,066
but I found my voice.

1528
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:12,433
You tried to hold me back,

1529
01:24:12,567 --> 01:24:14,233
but you couldn't.

1530
01:24:14,367 --> 01:24:15,600
You couldn't

1531
01:24:15,734 --> 01:24:19,367
because whatever amount of power
you thought you had over me...

1532
01:24:22,633 --> 01:24:24,400
...well, it doesn't exist.

1533
01:24:26,900 --> 01:24:28,633
You manipulated us,

1534
01:24:28,767 --> 01:24:29,867
betrayed our trust,

1535
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,133
and used our most intimate

1536
01:24:31,266 --> 01:24:32,967
and vulnerable secrets
against us.

1537
01:24:34,967 --> 01:24:37,200
And you didn't care,

1538
01:24:37,333 --> 01:24:38,433
because girls like us

1539
01:24:38,567 --> 01:24:39,433
are just...

1540
01:24:39,567 --> 01:24:42,166
invisible
to people like you.

1541
01:24:45,033 --> 01:24:46,934
But we're not your victims.

1542
01:24:47,066 --> 01:24:49,300
We're strong,

1543
01:24:49,433 --> 01:24:51,900
and we're resilient...

1544
01:24:53,033 --> 01:24:54,166
...and for
the rest of your life,

1545
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:55,233
you'll regret that

1546
01:24:55,367 --> 01:24:56,967
you ever messed
with girls like us.

1547
01:25:02,033 --> 01:25:03,600
Thank you,
Miss Lawrence.

1548
01:25:03,734 --> 01:25:05,800
You may leave the stand
when you are ready.

1549
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,100
That was great.
You did so good.

1550
01:25:17,233 --> 01:25:18,567
Did I really?

1551
01:25:21,066 --> 01:25:22,867
Will the defendant
please rise?

1552
01:25:28,433 --> 01:25:29,533
Mr. Reilly,

1553
01:25:29,667 --> 01:25:31,300
in accordance
with your plea agreement,

1554
01:25:31,433 --> 01:25:32,567
you are hereby sentenced

1555
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:35,834
to 20 years and eight months
in a federal penitentiary.

1556
01:25:47,033 --> 01:25:48,133
Not too shabby.

1557
01:25:48,266 --> 01:25:50,367
I think it'll do.

1558
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:52,867
How are you?

1559
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,066
I'm-- I'm good.

1560
01:25:55,467 --> 01:25:57,400
I'm really good, actually.

1561
01:25:57,533 --> 01:25:58,967
I mean, it'll take some time,

1562
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:01,200
but I'm in therapy,

1563
01:26:01,333 --> 01:26:03,667
and I'm getting through it,
thanks to you.

1564
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:05,467
You don't have to thank me.

1565
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:08,533
I should be thanking you.

1566
01:26:08,667 --> 01:26:10,767
Your bravery
changed this town.

1567
01:26:12,333 --> 01:26:13,800
And it actually changed me, too.

1568
01:26:19,433 --> 01:26:20,333
Hey, it's Holland.

1569
01:26:20,467 --> 01:26:21,700
Okay, got it.

1570
01:26:21,834 --> 01:26:23,433
Thank you.

1571
01:26:23,567 --> 01:26:24,767
- Thank you.
- I'm on my way.
