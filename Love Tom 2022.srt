TOM: Not too long ago,
I received a letter.

8
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:30,263
It was a letter from
a desperate young songwriter

9

asking for advice.

10
00:01:32,787 --> 00:01:34,442
I could tell that the rejection,

to happen

12
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:39,316

00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:31,413
and my father falls
and breaks his arm.

177
00:10:33,763 --> 00:10:35,851
My mother takes him
to the doctor's office

178
00:10:35,895 --> 00:10:40,769
to get a cast and 50 opioids.

179
00:10:43,293 --> 00:10:45,993
And he gamed the system
and he needed more

180
00:10:46,036 --> 00:10:48,342
and more and more,
and he was an addict

181
00:10:48,385 --> 00:10:50,345
right then and right there.

182
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,437
And he had to go
to a sanatorium,

183
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,831
which is really like a rehab.

184
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,095
My mother covered for him
with his bosses

185
00:11:01,138 --> 00:11:03,357
while he was gone,
and took him around

186
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,707
on his sales calls
when he got back.

187
00:11:09,451 --> 00:11:13,455
And it took a while
and he recovered.

188
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:20,854
Until he didn't.

189
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:25,902
I come from a long line
of storytellers.

190
00:11:25,946 --> 00:11:27,687
Masterful yarn spinners.

191
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:31,951
Every holiday, every Sunday,
every vacation,

192
00:11:31,995 --> 00:11:33,256
somebody would always say,

193
00:11:33,301 --> 00:11:35,869
"You know, that reminds me
of the time..."

194
00:11:35,912 --> 00:11:39,524
And I'm telling you my story
not because it's the best one,

195
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:41,788
it's just the one
that I know the best.

196
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:46,966
I wish that I'd recorded my
grandmother playing the piano,

197
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:50,274
my mother's laugh, my father
strumming the ukulele,

198
00:11:50,317 --> 00:11:52,972
my father-in-law reading
the Book of John.

199
00:11:54,365 --> 00:11:57,673
What I wouldn't give
to have those memories.

[ENGINE STARTS]

202
00:12:10,686 --> 00:12:13,254
February 9th, 1964.

203
00:12:13,297 --> 00:12:15,385
It was a Sunday night.
It was cold,

204
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:20,043
it was my mother's vegetable
soup and cornbread on TV trays.

205
00:12:20,086 --> 00:12:23,524
My mom and sister
sat on the couch,

206
00:12:23,567 --> 00:12:25,527
my dad sat
in the big easy chair.

207
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:28,878
I sat on the hearth
with my back to a roaring fire

208
00:12:28,922 --> 00:12:32,751
and Ed Sullivan said
to 73 million Americans

209
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,317
and the four Douglas's,

210
00:12:34,361 --> 00:12:37,147
"Ladies and gentleman,
welcome The Beatles."

211
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:38,888
My father loved The Beatles.

212
00:12:38,932 --> 00:12:40,846
All the other fathers thought
The Beatles were

213
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:42,196
the devil's right hand,

214
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:45,894
but not Thomas
Labert Douglas Junior.

215
00:12:45,938 --> 00:12:47,984
He loved their songs,
their harmonies,

216
00:12:48,028 --> 00:12:50,421
their Nehru jackets,
their haircuts.

217
00:12:50,465 --> 00:12:54,120
That's the first time I really
remember the power of a song.

218
00:12:54,163 --> 00:12:57,080
I was 11, my father was 53.

219
00:12:57,124 --> 00:12:58,341
What did I know?

220
00:12:58,385 --> 00:13:02,519
What I did know was that a boy
loves what his father loves.

221
00:13:02,563 --> 00:13:05,523
And that's the day
I became a songwriter.

222
00:13:09,962 --> 00:13:11,051
And then we went to Metro Music

223
00:13:11,094 --> 00:13:15,054
and bought a red,
six-string Hagstrom guitar.

224
00:13:15,097 --> 00:13:17,057
Took it home
and I was practicing.

225
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,407
The next day he burst
in my bedroom and he said,

226
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:22,802
"Man, we gotta
take that guitar back.

227
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:24,846
"You gotta be a bass player
like Paul McCartney.

228
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:27,980
"It's gonna be so much easier
for you to be in a band

229
00:13:28,024 --> 00:13:31,027
"as a bass player
than a guitar player."

230
00:13:31,071 --> 00:13:35,552
Big Tom, always my biggest fan
and the easiest to impress.

231
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:39,905
Then he dropped me off
at Morris Brandon Elementary

232
00:13:39,948 --> 00:13:43,169
and I boarded a yellow
school bus with some friends

233
00:13:43,212 --> 00:13:44,866
and classmates
and some teachers,

234
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:48,043
and we went to Atlanta Stadium
to hear, you guessed it,

235
00:13:48,087 --> 00:13:50,264
John, Paul, George, and Ringo.

236
00:13:50,307 --> 00:13:54,921
And I can still hear the girls
screaming in my ears.

237
00:13:56,443 --> 00:13:58,097
Dropping me off
to go see The Beatles

238
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,881
would be a little bit
like taking your

239
00:13:59,926 --> 00:14:01,361
11-year-old to Bonnaroo saying,

240
00:14:01,404 --> 00:14:02,405
"Have a good time, sweetie.

241
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,931
I'll come back and pick you up."

242
00:14:04,974 --> 00:14:06,758
It was pretty radical,
but then again,

243
00:14:06,802 --> 00:14:08,934
Big Tom was pretty radical.

244
00:14:08,977 --> 00:14:11,371
He had the radio on
in the morning when he shaved,

245
00:14:11,414 --> 00:14:14,941
the radio on in the afternoon
when he swam laps at the Y.

246
00:14:14,984 --> 00:14:16,942
They had a big Victrola
in their bedroom.

247
00:14:16,985 --> 00:14:20,033
He kept that
black vinyl spinning.

248
00:14:20,076 --> 00:14:24,080
Little did he know that I would
end up in this crazy business,

249
00:14:24,124 --> 00:14:26,125
living in a heartbreak town.

250
00:14:27,605 --> 00:14:29,129
Hey, I just want you to know

251
00:14:29,172 --> 00:14:30,870
what you're
getting yourself into.

252
00:14:32,393 --> 00:14:34,134
The writer has to learn to live

253
00:14:34,177 --> 00:14:37,963
in a space of
unresolvable conflict.

254

First you have to face
the dark overlord of apathy.

255
00:14:41,096 --> 00:14:45,100
And she sits in the corner
of your writing space

256
00:14:45,144 --> 00:14:49,149
and she smokes cool cigarettes
and sips espresso

257
00:14:49,192 --> 00:14:51,150
and she growls, "No, no, no,"

258
00:14:51,193 --> 00:14:54,980
with every strike of your
Blackwing Palomino pencil.

259
00:14:55,024 --> 00:14:57,984
And then you have to face
the face in the mirror,

260
00:14:58,027 --> 00:14:59,245
the one that
looks at you and says,

261
00:14:59,288 --> 00:15:02,336
"You're a fraud. This didn't
work out well yesterday,

262
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:03,946
"it won't work out well today

263
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:06,253
"and it won't
work out well tomorrow."

264

That voice is a rat that sits
on the edge of your piano

00:15:10,212 --> 00:15:12,389

and gnarly teeth

266
00:15:12,432 --> 00:15:14,260
and it utters
profanities at you.

You have to walk over,

screw down a brass lid,

And that's just to get
the song started.

In the spring of 2009,

274
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:48,033
the rat started talking to me.

by the tail,

screwed down
the brass lid, kaboom.

If a cat has nine lives,
a rat has 99 times 99 lives.

You never kill the rat,
you just have to

284
00:16:13,581 --> 00:16:16,539
deal with him over
and over and over again.

my own process.

trying to write a hit

a point of inspiration.

The weekend before,
I was gonna run

00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:58,929
the Nashville Marathon,
26.2 miserable miles.

00:16:58,974 --> 00:17:01,280
I started the race with
my two best friends.

301
00:17:01,323 --> 00:17:03,065
They abandoned me
at the halfway point.

a nondescript office park.

305
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,336
I saw a guy
in a yellow chicken suit

306
00:17:14,381 --> 00:17:16,383
and orange flip flops.
He sailed by.

307
00:17:16,425 --> 00:17:19,646
And a mature group of women
in matching purple tutus,

308
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,387
they raced by.

Then I saw him, or at
least the back of him.

310
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,176
His t-shirt read,
"I run this town."

311
00:17:28,221 --> 00:17:31,223
I was thinking of metaphors
and similes and analogies.

312
00:17:31,267 --> 00:17:35,270
I was delirious. I run this
town like a mafia boss.

I developed a hatred for him.

317
00:17:42,886 --> 00:17:46,500
I really hated myself
and I really hated running.

318
00:17:46,542 --> 00:17:47,979
My life was a mockery.

They say,

00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,486
They didn't see the rat.

in unison and they say,

♪ I run to you

365
00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:46,244
I really had an idyllic life
until about 1975.

366
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:49,290
I graduated from college,
my sister getting married,

367
00:20:50,552 --> 00:20:52,337
my father retiring
from U.S. Steel

368
00:20:52,381 --> 00:20:56,124
with a gold watch
and a 45-year pen.

369
00:20:57,167 --> 00:20:58,518
It should've been
the best of times.

370
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,303
It was, in fact,
the worst of times.

371
00:21:01,346 --> 00:21:04,827
'75 to '82's kind of
a watercolor blur.

372
00:21:04,872 --> 00:21:06,307
Let me describe it for you.

373
00:21:06,352 --> 00:21:10,486
It was days and days
of my father staying in bed,

374
00:21:10,529 --> 00:21:14,403
hefty black garbage bags filled
with every pill imaginable.

375
00:21:14,446 --> 00:21:17,884
It was doctor's offices,
psychologists,

376
00:21:17,928 --> 00:21:20,670
psychiatrists, hospitals,
shock treatments,

377
00:21:22,411 --> 00:21:24,631
Mount Paran Church of God
healing meetings.

378
00:21:24,673 --> 00:21:27,373
It was lifelong friends
of my father whispering

379
00:21:27,415 --> 00:21:29,635
as they passed him
in the hallway,

380
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,594
banished from the locker room.

381
00:21:31,637 --> 00:21:34,902
They gave up, he gave up,
I wanted to give up.

382
00:21:34,944 --> 00:21:38,339
But I can't give up
on something that I love,

383
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:40,342
and you can't either.

384
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:44,346
I was driving myself crazy

385
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:47,435
chasing my songwriting dream
in Nashville.

386
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,265
And my mother called me
and I could tell that

387
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:54,182
my father's slow motion suicide
was driving her insane,

388
00:21:54,224 --> 00:21:58,359
so I brought my father
to live with me in Nashville.

389
00:21:58,403 --> 00:22:00,449
And when he left home,
he would never go back

390
00:22:00,492 --> 00:22:03,017
to Atlanta again,
and my mother and father

391
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:05,498
would never live together
under the same roof.

392
00:22:07,064 --> 00:22:09,545
My songwriting wasn't
gaining any traction

393
00:22:09,588 --> 00:22:11,373
and I couldn't care
for my father,

394
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:14,288
so I reinvented myself
as a real estate broker

395
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,378
and my father and I
moved west to Dallas

396
00:22:17,423 --> 00:22:21,383
to drive my sister and brother
-in-law crazy for a while.

397
00:22:21,426 --> 00:22:24,385
You can't give up
on something that you love.

398
00:22:27,954 --> 00:22:29,434
The only way that I could pierce

399
00:22:29,478 --> 00:22:33,568
that fog of anti-depressants
and psychiatric voodoo

400
00:22:33,613 --> 00:22:35,919
all those years was songs.

401
00:22:35,962 --> 00:22:39,140
Songs of Nat King Cole
and Sinatra

402
00:22:39,182 --> 00:22:41,621
and Waylon and Willie and Hank.

403
00:22:41,663 --> 00:22:45,972
And freedom's just another word
for nothing left to lose,

404
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:48,192
and feeling good
was good enough for me

405
00:22:48,236 --> 00:22:49,541
and my Bobby McGee.

406
00:22:49,585 --> 00:22:53,067
My father loved
Kris Kristofferson.

407
00:22:53,109 --> 00:22:55,765
As poorly as I had done
in the music business,

408
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:58,942
I actually fared worse
in the real estate business.

409
00:22:58,986 --> 00:23:01,857
But interest rates
went to twenty percent

410
00:23:01,902 --> 00:23:04,338
there was the Savings
and Loan crisis.

411
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:08,038
It was about 1992 and
sometimes in the afternoon,

412
00:23:08,082 --> 00:23:09,474
I'd go pick my father up

413
00:23:09,518 --> 00:23:12,433
and take him around with me
on my sales calls.

414
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,349
We'd drive out
to some shopping center,

415
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,874
I'd find a shady place
and we'd park

416
00:23:17,917 --> 00:23:20,573
and he'd sleep
and I'd start at one end

417
00:23:20,615 --> 00:23:23,096
of the shopping center
and go to the other.

418
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,577
"I'm Tom Douglas
from Cornerstone Real Estate.

419
00:23:25,621 --> 00:23:28,450
"I lease the shopping center
down the road."

420
00:23:28,493 --> 00:23:30,583
I'd hand them my business card.

421
00:23:31,932 --> 00:23:35,544
At the same time I'm having
an audible conversation

422
00:23:35,587 --> 00:23:36,632
with prospective tenants,

423
00:23:36,675 --> 00:23:39,068
I'm having an argument
with Almighty God

424
00:23:39,113 --> 00:23:42,289
in which I say,
"God, it seems unfair that

425
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,161
"at 39 I'm jaded, cynical,

426
00:23:44,204 --> 00:23:46,555
"and incredibly disappointed
with my life."

427
00:23:46,598 --> 00:23:48,426
Almighty God says, "My son,

428
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,384
"you've been worshiping
the creation

429
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,909
"instead of me, the Creator.

430
00:23:52,952 --> 00:23:54,519
"How's that working out
for ya?"

431
00:23:56,042 --> 00:23:58,000
So there I stood
at the crossroads,

432
00:23:58,045 --> 00:23:59,960
asking myself, "Who am I?

433
00:24:00,002 --> 00:24:02,744
"Where am I from
and to whom do I belong?"

434
00:24:02,788 --> 00:24:05,922
Almighty God whispered,
"You're a writer.

435
00:24:05,965 --> 00:24:07,576
"You're from this family.

436
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:08,882
"You belong to me.

437
00:24:08,924 --> 00:24:10,839
"Your past is not your poison,

438
00:24:10,884 --> 00:24:13,146
"your past is
your greatest gift.

439
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,757
"Go write about the brokenness,

440
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,890
"go write about the healing

441
00:24:16,932 --> 00:24:20,588
"as you stumble down redemption
road toward home."

442
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:29,597
About a year later,
I pulled in the parking lot

443
00:24:29,642 --> 00:24:32,992
and walked the dimly lit,
lime green corridors

444
00:24:33,036 --> 00:24:35,560
of my father's nursing home
in Dallas.

445
00:24:35,604 --> 00:24:38,738
Unable to speak, he'd
become a shell of a man

446
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:44,439
with saggy sweatpants,
soup stained pajama top,

447
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:46,396
terrible slippers.

448
00:24:46,441 --> 00:24:48,050
Usually, when
I went to see him,

449
00:24:48,095 --> 00:24:50,576
he would just lie
on his bed with hands

450
00:24:50,618 --> 00:24:55,276
laced across his chest
like that of a coffin pose.

451
00:24:55,318 --> 00:24:59,366
My anger, fury, simmering
and disjointed prayers

452
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:01,412
in a metal chair
with a smiling picture

453
00:25:01,455 --> 00:25:02,848
of my mother between us.

454
00:25:04,807 --> 00:25:06,026
But this day...

455
00:25:06,068 --> 00:25:07,593
this day, I thought
I had the wrong room.

456
00:25:07,635 --> 00:25:09,811
I turned the corner,
the lights were on,

457
00:25:09,855 --> 00:25:12,423
music softly played
on his cassette player

458
00:25:12,467 --> 00:25:14,556
and it was a song
that I had written.

459
00:25:15,601 --> 00:25:18,255
He said,
"Buddy, I love this one."

460
00:25:19,647 --> 00:25:22,607
The calm and gentle demeanor
of a man whose countenance

461
00:25:22,651 --> 00:25:25,435
I had not seen
in some 20-odd years

462
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,655
sat on the edge
of a neatly made bed

463
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,570
with his hair combed,
freshly shaven,

464
00:25:29,615 --> 00:25:33,749
starched white shirt
and washed sweatpants.

465
00:25:33,792 --> 00:25:37,317
"Tommy, would you like
a piece of Freedent gum?"

466
00:25:37,926 --> 00:25:39,493
the smiling man asked.

467
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:42,192
After 19 years of living
with a ghost,

468
00:25:42,236 --> 00:25:44,846
my father and I shared
a piece of chewing gum

469
00:25:44,891 --> 00:25:45,805
and a little music.

470
00:25:45,847 --> 00:25:49,460
And I suppose
that's why I love songs

471
00:25:49,503 --> 00:25:51,375
and I believe in miracles.

472
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:53,726
Here's what he was

491
00:28:26,965 --> 00:28:30,359
from the mournful bagpipes
in the Scottish Highlands

492
00:28:30,403 --> 00:28:32,101
and we add a little shake
to Shakespeare

493
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:35,800
and we Bebopped with Bach
and rolled over with Beethoven

494
00:28:35,844 --> 00:28:39,194
and migrated to the hills
of Appalachia

495
00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:43,634
and breathed death and life
and misery and redemption.

496
00:28:43,677 --> 00:28:47,595
And the low rumbling chants
of the African slave ships

497
00:28:47,637 --> 00:28:50,945
all the way to the Alabama
cotton fields where we met

498
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:54,863
Robert Johnson and the devil
at a Clarksdale crossroads.

499
00:28:54,906 --> 00:28:57,910
And we bounced across
the Atlantic ocean

500
00:28:57,952 --> 00:29:02,261
to a transistor radio
in Keith Richards' bedroom.

501
00:29:02,305 --> 00:29:03,785
And we followed the song
and the glow

502
00:29:03,828 --> 00:29:06,875
of the rocket's red glare
and we raised the flag

503
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:10,226
in the dawns early light
to marching bands

504
00:29:10,269 --> 00:29:11,662
under Friday night lights.

505
00:29:11,705 --> 00:29:15,057
With brother facing brother,
in the uncivil war,

506
00:29:15,101 --> 00:29:17,972
the Yankees singing
Nearer My God To Thee

507
00:29:18,017 --> 00:29:19,887
and the Confederates
bellowing Dixie,

508
00:29:19,932 --> 00:29:23,848
to the greatest generation
singing Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy,

509
00:29:23,892 --> 00:29:26,894
running down a lost highway
to a bespeckled boy

510
00:29:26,939 --> 00:29:31,900
in Montgomery, Alabama who was
so lonesome that he could cry.

511
00:29:31,943 --> 00:29:35,382
And we followed the song
to the TEAC tape decks

512
00:29:35,424 --> 00:29:38,037
blasting the Ballad
of the Green Berets

513
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:41,561
all along the watchtower down
the Ho Chi Minh trail.

514
00:29:41,605 --> 00:29:44,520
Walking the line down
the long and winding

515
00:29:44,565 --> 00:29:47,088
yellow brick road with me
andBobby McGee,

516
00:29:47,133 --> 00:29:49,961
and we still hadn't found
what we're looking for.

517
00:29:50,005 --> 00:29:52,007
Talking to a pretty girl
in the chair

518
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:54,052
with friends in low places,

519
00:29:54,096 --> 00:29:56,619
with Indian outlaws
wearing no shoes,

520
00:29:56,663 --> 00:30:01,059
no shirt, no problem, praying,
"Jesus, take the wheel,"

521
00:30:01,103 --> 00:30:05,106
with teardrops on my guitar,
gently weeping.

522
00:30:07,066 --> 00:30:09,894
One of the fascinating perks
of this profession

523
00:30:09,938 --> 00:30:13,028
are the interesting people
that we get to meet.

524
00:30:13,071 --> 00:30:15,464
A few years ago, Alecia Moore,

525
00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:17,510
you might know her better
as Pink,

526
00:30:17,554 --> 00:30:19,861
reached out to my friend
Allen Shamblin and me

527
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:23,604
because she loved our song,
The House That Built Me.

528
00:30:23,646 --> 00:30:27,520
Alecia walked into my studio
and sat right down

529
00:30:27,564 --> 00:30:30,001
on the hard concrete floor.

530
00:30:30,045 --> 00:30:33,005
What do you do when
somebody sits on the floor?

531
00:30:33,048 --> 00:30:35,136
Well, you sit down
right next to them.

532
00:30:35,181 --> 00:30:37,836
It's kind of a brilliant
psychological move.

533
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:42,710
We talked. She told us her
story, we told her ours.

534
00:30:42,752 --> 00:30:46,278
We exposed our father wounds.
It was a magic day.

535
00:30:46,322 --> 00:30:48,498
We wrote two songs.

536
00:30:48,541 --> 00:30:50,195
One of them is called
Love Me Anyway,

537
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:54,155
which is on P!nk's album,
a duet with Chris Stapleton.

538
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,159
The other one
is a song called Recovering.

539
00:30:58,856 --> 00:31:02,730
The famous, the infamous.
The rich, the poor.

540
00:31:02,772 --> 00:31:04,905
We're all bleeding,
we're all broken,

541
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,951

How did a guy
selling real estate

558
00:32:22,069 --> 00:32:25,987
and advertising in Atlanta,
finally running away from home

559
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:30,730
at the ripe old age of 27,
to a four-year odyssey

560
00:32:30,773 --> 00:32:34,734
in music city but always
on the outside looking in,

561
00:32:34,778 --> 00:32:40,261
leaving never to return,
settling down in Dallas, Texas

562
00:32:40,306 --> 00:32:43,177
with a beautiful wife
and three children,

563
00:32:43,221 --> 00:32:46,834
sitting down at a grand piano
on a bright blue

564
00:32:46,876 --> 00:32:50,010
Saturday morning with a black
and white composition book,

565
00:32:50,055 --> 00:32:51,751
a good cup of coffee,

566
00:32:51,795 --> 00:32:53,797
finally decide
to tell the truth,

567
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,104
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

568
00:32:56,147 --> 00:33:01,195
How did he become
just another 25-year,

569
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:06,027
overnight sensation
writing you a letter of hope,

570
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:09,856
telling you everything
you never wanted to know?

571
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:13,861
I gave up and the grace of God
rescued me.

572
00:33:13,903 --> 00:33:15,950
Mine is really
a story of failure.

573
00:33:15,993 --> 00:33:18,692
I didn't work and work
and finally figure it out.

574
00:33:18,734 --> 00:33:21,215
I surrendered.
I surrendered my past

575
00:33:21,259 --> 00:33:23,218
so I could get on
with my future.

576
00:33:23,261 --> 00:33:27,656
In the summer of 2002,
the famed Bluebird Cafe

577
00:33:27,701 --> 00:33:29,181
sent Allen Shamblin
and his family,

578
00:33:29,223 --> 00:33:31,965
me and my family,
out to Sundance, Utah

579
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:34,055
to do a writer's round.

580
00:33:34,098 --> 00:33:36,491
One morning, Allen came
in the restaurant

581
00:33:36,536 --> 00:33:38,058
and calmly said,
"I've been thinking

582
00:33:38,103 --> 00:33:41,584
"of my childhood home.
What if we wrote a song

583
00:33:41,627 --> 00:33:43,891
"not about the houses
that we build,

584
00:33:43,933 --> 00:33:45,980
"but the house that built me?"

585
00:33:46,023 --> 00:33:50,288
As soon as Allen said that,
the Earth tilted on its axis.

586
00:33:50,332 --> 00:33:52,377
The forks were suspended
in midair,

587
00:33:52,421 --> 00:33:54,423
the water froze in the pitcher.

588
00:33:54,467 --> 00:33:57,338
That's the power of a good idea.

589
00:33:57,383 --> 00:34:00,255
Allen was thinking of his home
in Huffman, Texas.

590
00:34:00,298 --> 00:34:03,605
I took a trip back
to 3018 Argonne Drive,

591
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:05,520
and maybe, just maybe,
you're thinking

592
00:34:05,565 --> 00:34:07,784
of your childhood home
right now.

593
00:34:07,827 --> 00:34:11,135
An idea is a powerful thing.
It's a metaphor.

594
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:13,050
It's our details
and our memories,

595
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:15,835
but it transports you
back to another place

596
00:34:15,878 --> 00:34:17,664
and another time.

597
00:34:17,706 --> 00:34:20,231
You wanna slap somebody that
starts a sentence with,

598
00:34:20,275 --> 00:34:23,235
"Socrates said,"
but Socrates said,

599
00:34:23,277 --> 00:34:26,672
"Man's greatest creative act
is the ability to see

600
00:34:26,715 --> 00:34:28,021
"one thing as another."

601
00:34:28,065 --> 00:34:29,240
He's talking about metaphor.

602
00:34:29,284 --> 00:34:32,157
He's talking about
the house that built me.

603
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:35,159
I begged Allen
not to utter those five words

604
00:34:35,202 --> 00:34:38,728
to another living soul
until we got back to Nashville.

605
00:34:38,771 --> 00:34:41,253
And true to his word,
we got back,

606
00:34:41,295 --> 00:34:43,951
Allen had written four verses,
I had written three.

607
00:34:43,994 --> 00:34:47,085
We put our first draft together.
It was epic.

608
00:34:47,128 --> 00:34:49,565
It was 10 minutes long.
We demoed it,

609
00:34:49,608 --> 00:34:51,219
we turned it in
to the publisher

610
00:34:51,262 --> 00:34:54,875
and their response was, "Cool."

611
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:57,268
Which in Nashville
is code speak for,

612
00:34:57,311 --> 00:35:00,967
"We will never, ever,
listen to that song again."

613
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:03,536
Crushed but undaunted,
Allen and I would get together

614
00:35:03,579 --> 00:35:09,628
over the next S-E-V-E-N years
and work on other songs.

615
00:35:09,672 --> 00:35:13,110
In 2009,
we dusted off the lyrics

616
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:14,286
to The House That Built Me.

617
00:35:14,329 --> 00:35:16,722
We printed them off,
which by this time were

618
00:35:16,766 --> 00:35:19,768
as voluminous as
the novel East Of Eden.

619
00:35:19,813 --> 00:35:22,076
We spread it out
on my coffee table,

620
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:25,905
we scratched out, we deleted,
we etched out.

621
00:35:25,949 --> 00:35:28,735
Finally got down
to the absolute essence,

622
00:35:28,777 --> 00:35:32,085
only to realize
we were missing something.

623
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,306
We didn't have the setup line
for the hook.

624
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:36,873
We didn't have,
"If I can just come in

625
00:35:36,916 --> 00:35:38,353
"I swear I'll leave.

626
00:35:38,396 --> 00:35:40,094
"Won't take nothing but
a memory,"

627
00:35:40,137 --> 00:35:42,052
from The House That Built Me.

628
00:35:42,922 --> 00:35:45,317
This time, we demoed it again.

629
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,275
We turned it in
to the publisher.

630
00:35:47,318 --> 00:35:50,277
The sirens screamed,
the lights flashed,

631
00:35:50,322 --> 00:35:53,193
and people freaked out.

00:40:36,782 --> 00:40:38,914
When I moved my family
to Nashville

675
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:42,483
the second time in 1997,
a good friend,

676
00:40:42,527 --> 00:40:47,009
a great songwriter,
took me aside for a drink

677
00:40:47,052 --> 00:40:49,141
and said,
"You know pal,

678
00:40:49,184 --> 00:40:51,273
"there's nothing that
a good divorce wouldn't do

679
00:40:51,318 --> 00:40:53,755
"to help your songwriting."

680
00:40:53,798 --> 00:40:56,235
I said, "That's fascinating,

681
00:40:56,278 --> 00:41:00,065
but I better check with
my wife on that one."

682
00:41:00,108 --> 00:41:02,634
My heart and my home
are in Katie,

683
00:41:02,677 --> 00:41:05,288
the love of my life,
and my children,

684
00:41:05,331 --> 00:41:09,641
Katherine, Claire, and Tommy,
my son-in-law, Austin,

00:41:12,338 --> 00:41:13,905
I hope you get married.

687
00:41:15,342 --> 00:41:18,213
I pray you're blessed
with children.

688
00:41:18,257 --> 00:41:21,086
I hope your life is messy
and complicated

689
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:23,742
and beautiful
and breathtakingly magical.

690
00:41:23,784 --> 00:41:26,614
Remember, it's all a love song.

691
00:41:26,657 --> 00:41:29,487
My wife and children walk
in and out of the words

692
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:31,097
and the music of all my songs.

693
00:41:33,795 --> 00:41:39,409
Little Rock was about my dad,
but I couldn't stop there.

694
00:41:39,452 --> 00:41:43,065
1994, the son becomes
the father

695
00:41:43,108 --> 00:41:44,762
and my son, Tommy, was born.

696
00:41:44,806 --> 00:41:48,288
My life was evolving
and so were my songs.

697
00:41:48,331 --> 00:41:51,246
When the doctor said,
"Congratulations, you have a..."

698
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:53,335
He didn't say,
"You have a boy,"

699
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,728
he said, "You have a son."

700
00:41:54,773 --> 00:41:57,601
My life and songs would
never be the same.

701
00:41:57,644 --> 00:41:59,952
Without Tommy,
no Grown Men Don't Cry.

702
00:41:59,994 --> 00:42:02,128
Without Tommy, no Drunk Girl,

703
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:05,130
which is really just
a fatherly admonition

704
00:42:05,173 --> 00:42:09,788
to a young man how to treat
a young lady

705
00:42:09,831 --> 00:42:12,268
in a compromised situation.

706
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:15,793
♪ Take a drunk girl home

707
00:42:15,836 --> 00:42:19,623
In 2005, Tim McGraw asked me
if I wanted to collaborate

708
00:42:19,666 --> 00:42:22,148
with him on the end title song
of a movie

709
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:23,715
that he was making, Flicka.

710
00:42:23,757 --> 00:42:27,762
I flew out to California
and as the sun burned down

711
00:42:27,806 --> 00:42:30,635
on the Hollywood hills,
I entered the movie set.

712
00:42:30,677 --> 00:42:34,028
I was absolutely panic stricken,
'cause they needed

713
00:42:34,072 --> 00:42:36,422
this amazing song in two weeks.

714
00:42:36,465 --> 00:42:39,121
So I flew home to Nashville
the next day

715
00:42:39,164 --> 00:42:43,864
and my family was scheduled to
go on our annual trip to Florida

716
00:42:43,909 --> 00:42:45,780
right after that,
I told my wife Katie,

717
00:42:45,824 --> 00:42:48,652
"I gotta stay here.
I gotta work on this song.

718
00:42:48,695 --> 00:42:50,829
"It's gotta be amazing."

719
00:42:50,871 --> 00:42:54,483
Of course she prevailed
and I got in the station wagon

720
00:42:54,527 --> 00:42:56,704
the next morning and drove
eight hours to Florida.

721
00:42:56,748 --> 00:43:00,664
It's ironic now, looking back,
that I was trying to write

722
00:43:00,708 --> 00:43:02,840
a father-daughter song
completely detached

723
00:43:02,884 --> 00:43:05,670
from my own children
who were 10 feet away.

724
00:43:05,713 --> 00:43:08,802
About midweek, I was sitting
on the porch and I was brooding,

725
00:43:08,847 --> 00:43:12,893
and Katie came out
with two glasses of wine.

726
00:43:12,938 --> 00:43:15,896
You'd think she would
chastise me and lower the boom

727
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:17,420
for my pity party.

728
00:43:17,463 --> 00:43:20,815
Instead, she gave me
a kiss on the cheek

729
00:43:20,858 --> 00:43:25,427
because you don't give up
on someone that you love.

730
00:43:25,472 --> 00:43:29,431
And then she asked,
"What's the story about?"

731
00:43:29,476 --> 00:43:31,739
"It's a father-daughter
coming of age story."

732
00:43:31,782 --> 00:43:33,088
She said,
"You have daughters.

733
00:43:33,132 --> 00:43:34,786
"Tell me about that."

734
00:43:34,829 --> 00:43:37,657
So I went through a typical day
with my daughters and she said,

735
00:43:37,702 --> 00:43:40,791
"You have an evening ritual."
I said, "I go upstairs,

736
00:43:40,835 --> 00:43:42,576
"I read
The Chronicles of Narnia,

737
00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:44,969
"I kiss the girls goodnight.
I turn off the light.

738
00:43:45,012 --> 00:43:49,496
"I say, 'I love you,'
they say, 'Love you more.'"

739
00:43:49,539 --> 00:43:52,717
My wife is scribbling furiously
in a yellow legal pad

740
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,762
and then she hands it to me
and she says, "Here it is."

741
00:43:55,806 --> 00:43:58,896
I looked at it.
In fact, there it was.

742
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,811
Fathers and daughters,
it's beautiful

743
00:44:00,855 --> 00:44:02,726
and it's complicated.

744
00:44:02,769 --> 00:44:07,775

aspirations bled into this song.

after the rollercoaster ride
of addiction and depression,

772
00:46:41,188 --> 00:46:46,804
after the birth and death
and resurrection of a dream,

773
00:46:46,847 --> 00:46:50,155
I came back to Dallas
celebrating my song

774

as much as my father's
as it was mine.

780

He'd given me
the blessing of his love

781

and the gift of a song.

782
00:47:10,043 --> 00:47:13,134

and doctor and orderly

783
00:47:13,177 --> 00:47:17,704

Hank said it best,

"Nobody gets out alive."

830
00:50:31,331 --> 00:50:34,552
Ours, yours is a noble calling.
Mark Twain said

831
00:50:34,596 --> 00:50:36,510
the two most important days
in your life

832
00:50:36,554 --> 00:50:39,644
is the day you're born
and the day you figure out why.

833
00:50:39,688 --> 00:50:41,255
Well, we know why.

834
00:50:41,298 --> 00:50:43,300
We know why
because we have to write.

835
00:50:43,344 --> 00:50:46,085
We have to write because a
frightened mom and daddy

836
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:48,610
on the ninth floor of
a children's hospital

837
00:50:48,653 --> 00:50:51,264
are gonna need something
inspiring to listen to

838
00:50:51,309 --> 00:50:54,137
while they wait for the
prognosis of their sick baby.

839
00:50:54,181 --> 00:50:57,489
And the singer
on a stage in Afghanistan

840
00:50:57,532 --> 00:51:01,057
is gonna need to bring a little
home to homesick soldiers.

841
00:51:01,101 --> 00:51:02,929
And sometimes
you just wanna

842
00:51:02,972 --> 00:51:06,802
roll the windows down
and turn the radio up real loud.

843
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:15,246
We're overcompensated
and underpaid.

844
00:51:15,289 --> 00:51:16,550
We don't do it for the money.

845
00:51:16,594 --> 00:51:19,206
We would pay them
to let us do it.

846
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:22,208
We have brilliant advocates
who will help us reconcile

847
00:51:22,253 --> 00:51:24,385
our art and their technology.
Don't sweat it.

848
00:51:24,429 --> 00:51:27,735
If the art is compelling,
we will get paid.

849
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:30,260
We have a gift
and with that gift comes

850
00:51:30,304 --> 00:51:31,871
an immense responsibility.

851
00:51:31,914 --> 00:51:35,440
We're responsible
not to become the victims

852
00:51:35,483 --> 00:51:38,181
of the catastrophe of failure
where we think that

853
00:51:38,224 --> 00:51:40,835
we're doomed and everything
conspires against us,

854
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,101
or victims of the catastrophe
of success,

855
00:51:44,143 --> 00:51:45,927
thank you, Tennessee Williams,

856
00:51:45,972 --> 00:51:48,800
where once removed from
the struggle of creation.

857
00:51:48,844 --> 00:51:52,195
We're nothing but swords
cutting daisies.

858
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:54,284
And the result of both

is that we end up worshipping
the creation

860
00:51:57,157 --> 00:51:58,766
and not the Creator.

861
00:51:58,811 --> 00:52:02,422
Idols ultimately require
everything from you.

862
00:52:07,253 --> 00:52:11,476
In closing, my dear friend,
in the end and in the beginning,

863
00:52:11,518 --> 00:52:16,784
God creates and we recreate.
God redeems and so do we.

864
00:52:16,829 --> 00:52:19,135
We write down the songs
that he gives us.

865
00:52:19,179 --> 00:52:22,443
He allows us to participate
in this heavenly endeavor

866
00:52:22,487 --> 00:52:25,925
and through our anthems,
heaven whispers and leads

867
00:52:25,967 --> 00:52:28,188
the prodigal child back home.

868
00:52:28,231 --> 00:52:31,670
And when we save one boy
and save one girl,

869
00:52:31,713 --> 00:52:34,411
we in fact,
save the whole world.

870
00:52:34,454 --> 00:52:38,851
So tonight all's well,
but put your pen to paper

871
00:52:38,893 --> 00:52:41,331
because sooner or later,
I will get lost

872
00:52:41,375 --> 00:52:44,856
and need you to help me
find my way back home.

873
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:48,338
Don't give up on something
that you love,

874
00:52:48,382 --> 00:52:51,385
because I'll follow your song.

875
00:52:51,429 --> 00:52:56,608
That's why you're here.
Love, Tom.

876
00:53:42,043 --> 00:53:45,351
TOM: That's why you're here.
That's why.

877
00:53:47,485 --> 00:53:49,313
Love, Tom.
