wherever it may hide,

57
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,102
it is time to unmask it and
reveal truth to the world.

58
00:04:15,102 --> 00:04:17,800
It is time to right the world's wrongs

59
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,399

Cut.

63
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,550
- Adding Super Leaf to the shot.

64
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,100
Gotta get the leaf in the shot.

65
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,940
Sweet.

66

- IQ.
- This is not a film

67
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,200
on the supernatural properties of a leaf.

68
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,150
It has no business
being in my masterpiece.

69
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,020
- Hang in there, captain!

70
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,189
Super leaf comes in for the rescue.

81
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:25,592

Oh, watch the road, will ya?

- What are you scrubs up to no?

89
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,487
- We're making a cool movie

90
00:05:44,487 --> 00:05:46,750
and Bernie plays as Gonzo superhero-

91
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,300
- Stop talking, what are you-
- Who's gonna save the world

92
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,870
as we know it, and the
bad guys, the bad guys...

93
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:55,115
Hey, you want to be the bad guys?

94
00:05:55,115 --> 00:05:56,380
- Do I wanna-
- Anyway, these bad guys,

95
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,213
they try to destroy everything-

96
00:05:57,213 --> 00:05:59,470
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

97
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:02,100
Shut your trap.

98
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,547
- Shutting trap now.
- Okay.

99
00:06:04,547 --> 00:06:05,380
Thank you.

100
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,550
Oh hey, a movie with a girl director.

101
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,915
What is this thing?
- Russell.

102
00:06:10,915 --> 00:06:13,580
(Russell laughs)
- A viewfinder.

103
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,710

- That's enough.

104
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,543

105
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,140
What are you going to

00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:21,580
Wimp.

107
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,020

108
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,950

Spatula.

113
00:06:30,713 --> 00:06:32,130
Gah!

114
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,616
Who am I?

115
00:06:33,616 --> 00:06:35,584
- [Girl] Hang on.

116
00:06:35,584 --> 00:06:38,000
- Give it back to her.

117
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,258
- And what are you going to do if I don't?

118
00:06:40,258 --> 00:06:42,758
(tense music)

119
00:06:44,482 --> 00:06:46,781
- Sick him, Splat! Get him boy!

120
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:47,614

121
00:06:47,614 --> 00:06:49,090
(viewfinder shatters)
(Russell laughs)

122
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:51,020
- And cut.

123
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,082
Now that is what I call entertainment.

124
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:55,982
Oh.

125
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:57,388
- [Lens Cap] My viewfinder.

126
00:06:57,388 --> 00:07:00,101
- Aww, now look what you made me do.

127
00:07:00,101 --> 00:07:01,410

128
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,763

(Splat growls)

136
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,360
Stay away. (clears throat)

137
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,260
We're out of here.

138
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,813
So...

139
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,293
- Spielberg.

140
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,033
It's Steven Spielberg.

141
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,659
- I should have stopped him.

142
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:34,893
- It's not your fault.

143
00:07:35,971 --> 00:07:37,293
Your eye. What happened to your eye?

144
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,430
- Some super hero.

145
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:44,560
Can't even protect my friends.
(tires squealing)

148
00:07:56,806 --> 00:07:59,491

149
00:07:59,491 --> 00:08:00,324
Mister!

150
00:08:01,476 --> 00:08:03,096
- Splat, no.

151
00:08:03,096 --> 00:08:05,400
Splat, no boy.

152
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,090
You know how gassy you get.

153
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,970
- Ooh, Gooey Chewy bars.

154
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,270
- There's only three left.

155
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,090
- Cheers.

156
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,120
- To the lame-os.

157
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,183
- Yeah.

158
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,243
Lame-os.

159
00:08:24,947 --> 00:08:26,414
(Splat farts)

160
00:08:26,414 --> 00:08:27,247
- Oh!
- Ah!

161
00:08:28,331 --> 00:08:30,873

those did you eat? Geez.

162
00:08:32,749 --> 00:08:37,227
(shoes honking)
(tense music)

163
00:08:37,227 --> 00:08:40,039
(Wing Nut grunts)

164
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,390
- Let me get this straight.

165
00:08:43,616 --> 00:08:46,500
You let the factory ship my special batch

166
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,410
of Gooey Chewies to the wrong addresses?

167
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,763
- We got 'em back, sir.

168
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,860
About one box.

169
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,693
- One box?

170
00:08:54,693 --> 00:08:58,430
One bar will make a person
immune to my laughter generator.

171
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,923
Who's responsible?

172
00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:05,620
(quirky music)

173
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,453
Well?

174
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:08,481
Well, who was driving?

175
00:09:10,045 --> 00:09:12,878
(clown whistling)

176
00:09:13,755 --> 00:09:16,205
(phone buzzing)

177
00:09:16,205 --> 00:09:18,280
- For whom doth the bell toll?

178
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,400
- Yell-oh?

179
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,830
- It's tolls for thee.

180
00:09:25,962 --> 00:09:30,962
(laughing)
(tense, dramatic music)

181
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,766

183
00:09:40,939 --> 00:09:42,387

He died doing what he loved.

187
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,190
- Wing Nut.
- Sir?

188
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,590
- We had trackers on each
of these boxes, did we not?

189
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,810
- Yes we did, sir.

190
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,223
- Then find it.

191
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,770
- What if someone's already eaten one?

192
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:05,110
- Then find him and bring him here.

193
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,610
- Okay.
- But do it quietly,

194
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:07,960
so we don't attract the attention

195
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,563
of The World Intelligence Team.

196
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,070
- Right.
- Oh, and Wing Nut?

197
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,000
- Hm?

198
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,650
- Do it now!

199
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:17,620
- On my way. (chuckles)

200
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,660
- Excitement continues to rise.

201
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,280
Every country around the
world will be watching

202
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,530
in eager expectation regarding

203
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:28,270
this unprecedented event where
the queen and the president

204
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:31,380
and other top world leaders
will soon be in Paris,

205
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:35,610
signing a treaty to once and
for all usher in world peace.

206
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,300
- The United Kingdom looks upon

207
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,330
this auspicious event with
the greatest anticipation.

208
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,910
Nowhere in the history of mankind

209
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,400
has such a possibility...
(Splat grunts)

210
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,907
Presented itself and it is in both honor

211
00:10:49,752 --> 00:10:52,085
and humility that I shall...

212
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:59,740
- So, um, how do you like the meatloaf?

213
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,573
- Meatloaf...

214
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,013
I was wondering.

215
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,040
- It's not as good as what mom made.

216
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:11,346
(soft, melancholy music)

217
00:11:11,346 --> 00:11:13,261
You still miss her?

218
00:11:13,261 --> 00:11:14,094
(Bernie sighs)

219
00:11:14,094 --> 00:11:15,030
Yeah, me too.

220
00:11:17,627 --> 00:11:19,930
Hey, I heard a good joke at work today.

221
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,560
What did the sea monsters eat for lunch?

222
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,000
- Not tonight, dad.

223
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,090
- Come on, you like my jokes.

224
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,187
I mean they're a little corny, but-

225
00:11:26,187 --> 00:11:27,020
- Yeah.

226
00:11:28,346 --> 00:11:31,763
(soft, melancholy music)

227
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,850
- All right. What's up kiddo?

228
00:11:38,128 --> 00:11:42,953
- Don't you ever, you know,
get tired of being a nobody?

229
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,340
- Um...

230
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,063
- No, no, I don't mean you.

231
00:11:48,013 --> 00:11:50,100
Look, I know we need the extra money

232
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,490
and I get that schools
need custodial engineers.

233
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:54,490
- You mean janitors.

234
00:11:55,528 --> 00:11:58,451
(Bernie sighs)

235
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:00,330
It's okay, we all have value.

236
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:01,910
- Yeah, right.

237
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,710
Like being some jerk's punching bag.

238
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:08,323
- Okay. So that's what
this is all about, right?

239
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,623
- I tried helping someone and messed up.

240
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,383
Just like always.

241
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,231
Talk about a loser.

242
00:12:18,231 --> 00:12:20,650
- Hey, you're not a loser for messing up.

243
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:23,040
You have one of the biggest
hearts of anyone I've ever met.

244
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,000
- Right.

245
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,630
- You do.

246
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,463
And you...

247
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,020
You got that from your mother.

248
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,820
Come on, I see how you
look out for your friends.

249
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,853
- The lame-os.

250
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,450
Yeah. I'm real good at that.

251
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:44,350
- Lens Cap and IQ, they're
not lame-os, they're...

252
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:47,950
Okay, they're little
weird, but they have value.

253
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:48,783
We all do.

254
00:12:51,956 --> 00:12:53,250
I know what'll cheer you up.

255
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,443
I have a surprise.

256
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I want you to close your
eyes and don't peek.

257
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,593
All right?

258
00:13:02,593 --> 00:13:05,430
(Bernie sighs)

259
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,680
And...

260
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:09,993
Voila.

261
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,260
- What is this?

262
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,080
- It's your dessert.
That is angel food cake.

263
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,243
Bam.
(laughs)

264
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:24,192
Okay, it's a little, it's
a little over cooked.

265
00:13:24,192 --> 00:13:25,040
(pinging)

266
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,873
Okay. You know what?

267
00:13:25,873 --> 00:13:27,308
You made your point.

268
00:13:27,308 --> 00:13:30,380
(grumbles)

269
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,220
- Why don't you go upstairs,
start your homework

270
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,003
and I'll, uh, and I'll
bring some ice cream.

271
00:13:36,446 --> 00:13:38,870
- Eh, you know, I think I'm good.

272
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,652
- I can't burn the ice cream.

273
00:13:40,652 --> 00:13:41,736
- Hmm.

274
00:13:41,736 --> 00:13:42,660
- Hmm.

275
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,493
Go.

276
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,163
Fish and ships.

277
00:13:52,595 --> 00:13:53,738
- What?

278
00:13:53,738 --> 00:13:57,411
- What the sea monsters
ate, fish and ships.

279
00:13:57,411 --> 00:13:58,461
(snorts)
You know...

280
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:01,963
Bern?

281
00:14:03,711 --> 00:14:04,690
(Bernie sighs)

282
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,003
Everyone has value, son.

283
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:11,603
God, he doesn't make junk.
(soft music)

284
00:14:21,842 --> 00:14:23,954
(sighs)

285
00:14:23,954 --> 00:14:27,219
(water running)

286
00:14:27,219 --> 00:14:29,469
(brushing)

287
00:14:31,684 --> 00:14:34,684
(upbeat rock music)

288
00:14:37,303 --> 00:14:38,730
- Give it back to her.

289
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:42,944
Give it back to her.
Am I speaking clearly?

290
00:14:42,944 --> 00:14:44,370
You talkin' to me?

291
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,377
Boom.

292
00:14:45,377 --> 00:14:46,940
Want another kick? Boom.

293
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,670
You talkin' to me?

294
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,280
There is no one behind me,
so you're talking to me

295
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,753
and that is a bad idea.

296
00:14:53,753 --> 00:14:56,610
(grunting)

297
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,060
You go, leave.

298
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:03,020
You go, leave. I don't wanna
see you around her anymore.

299
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:06,210
Pick up the viewfinder or
else this will happen again.

300
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,480
Boom. But a thousand times.

301
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,630
Boom boom boom boom boom boom boom.

302
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,290
Thunder.

303
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,123
Lightening.

304
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,370
(grunting)

305
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:22,718
(hits)
(glass shatters)

306
00:15:28,008 --> 00:15:29,460
(Bernie sighs)

307
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,630
- [Paul] Bern, you all right?

308
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,463
- Uh...

309
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,520
Yeah. I...

310
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,980
Yeah, I'm fine.

311
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,480
- [Paul] Hey, wrap things
up, sport. Time for bed.

312
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:41,763
- Yeah.

313
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:46,700
- [Paul] You're grounded.
You are grounded, mister.

314
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,350
And for a very long time.

315
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,300
- [Mom] Paul.

316
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,850
- [Paul] He left the gate open
and we could have lost Splat.

317
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,808
Sometimes I wonder if he
even has a brain in that-

318
00:15:54,808 --> 00:15:57,277
- [Mom] Paul David Dingledorf.

319
00:15:57,277 --> 00:15:59,730
God does not make junk.

320
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,782
- [Paul] I, I never said that.

321
00:16:01,782 --> 00:16:04,257
- [Mom] You didn't have
to. That's what he thinks.

322
00:16:04,257 --> 00:16:05,960
- I-
- Talk to him, Paul.

323
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,840
Tell him.
- But I didn't mean-

324
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,635
- [Mom] I know, just do it.

325
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,300
(knocking)

326
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,133
- [Paul] Bernie?

327
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:18,100
(knocking)

328
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:18,953
Bernie, son?

329
00:16:20,773 --> 00:16:21,606
Can I come in?

330
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:24,348
Bernie?

331
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:31,840
- And so what am I supposed to do?

332
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,763
Just let him have his way?

333
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,207
I mean a guy's gotta stand
up for his rights, you know?

334
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:49,220
So I'm just gonna continue

335
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,533
to be a wimpy looser and that's it?

336
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,483
I miss you, mom.

337
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,127
Really bad.
(melancholy music)

338
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,262
(sign buzzing)

339
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,730
- Are you sure this place is okay?

340
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,542
This place being all secret and all?

341
00:17:27,542 --> 00:17:28,678
Ooh!

342
00:17:28,678 --> 00:17:29,970
(sighs)
Goodness.

343
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:30,843
- Here you go.

344
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,670
Only the select are given access

345
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,530
to such classified locations.

346
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:38,720
Rest assured men of great
power such as myself...

347
00:17:39,722 --> 00:17:41,090
(grunts)
(bottle pops)

348
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,593
Can always make exceptions.
- Oh, oh.

349
00:17:49,275 --> 00:17:50,305
(beeping)

350
00:17:50,305 --> 00:17:52,250
(staticky buzzing)

351
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,083
- Hello?

352
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,890
- Madam Secretary.

353
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,270
- Where is everyone?

354
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,880
- Um, well, I'm only one
at this station, ma'am.

355
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,600
We are in the middle of nowhere.

356
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,930
- Which explains why we've traced

357
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,900
the secret warehouse
and weapons headquarters

358
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,170
of the notorious. Dr.
Chuckles to your district.

359
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,300
Who would expect world
peace to be destroyed

360
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,823
from such a no nothing location?

361
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,940
Is someone with you?

362
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,600
- Someone with, someone with me?

363
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,860
No, no.

364
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,090
No unauthorized personnel here, ma'am.

365
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:22,950
I'm all alone.

366
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,890
Agent 001/2 at your
service, Madam Secretary.

367
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,840
You were mentioning Dr.
Chuckles and world peace.

368
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,280
- High level security indicates

369
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,450
that he plans to destroy the
upcoming World Peace Conference

370
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,120
tomorrow in Paris.

371
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,200
- Well uh, how's that, Madam Secretary?

372
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,030
- He has developed a giant laugh generator

373
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,540
that will send the world,
starting from top leaders

374
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,070
and working its way
down to the common man,

375
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,410
into uncontrollable fits of laughter.

376
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:50,440
He plans to reduce conference into nothing

377
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,893
but laughing mayhem.

378
00:18:52,782 --> 00:18:53,810
- Oh, that's terrible.

379
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:54,643
- And you.

380
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,520
You must shut that
machine down at all costs.

381
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,210
- I'll get right on it, Madam Secretary.

382
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:02,720
- There is one thing
you should know first.

383
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,710
His agents have stolen something
called Gooey Chewy bars

384
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,720
from all across your town.

385
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,820
- Uh, Gooey Chewy bars.

386
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,820
Why is that important, Madam Secretary?

387
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,970
- Our best guess is that he has created

388
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:17,230
a special batch of bars
with a unique ingredient

389
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,110
protecting Chuckles and his workers

390
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,810
from the effects of the laugh generator.

391
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,790
These bars could give you and our agents

392
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,860
protection against that laugh generator,

393
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,810
but Chuckles has retrieved
all of the boxes but one,

394
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,400
which our satellites reveal

395
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:36,080
was thrown into this garbage
can by this individual,

396
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,240
one Bernard Dingledorf.

397
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,100
- He looks dangerous.

398
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,750
- You must bring him in
and find out what he knows,

399
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,660
but quietly to not attract Dr. Chuckles.

400
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:49,200
Now we've sent agents to assist,
but time is of the essence.

401
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,720
- I will personally attend to
it myself, Madam Secretary.

402
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,642
- There's no one there to help you?

403
00:19:53,642 --> 00:19:58,618
- Agent-
(grunts)

404
00:19:58,618 --> 00:19:59,451
Thank you.

405
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:03,260
Agent 001/2 at your
service, Madam Secretary.

406
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,840
- Lord, help us all.

407
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,483
- Thank you, ma'am.

408
00:20:06,483 --> 00:20:11,483
(alarm beeping)
(water spraying)

409
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,170
Thank you very much.

410
00:20:14,203 --> 00:20:16,060
- Bernie, let's go. Time for school.

411
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,430
Hey. Seven o'clock kiddo, rise and shine.

412
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,970
Let's go.

413
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,170
Come on. 20 minutes.

414
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,040
Cereal's on the table. See you at school.

415
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:28,040
(toy squeaks)
(Bernie groans)

416
00:20:29,138 --> 00:20:32,388

424

(grunts)

430
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,391
- Oh.

431

(grunts)

432
00:21:54,924 --> 00:21:56,210
(quirky, mysterious music)

433
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:57,043
Oh!

(quirky, mysterious music)

441
00:22:43,012 --> 00:22:43,845
Hm.

442
00:22:43,845 --> 00:22:44,971
(bowl clatters)

443
00:22:44,971 --> 00:22:48,038

445
00:22:56,481 --> 00:22:57,818
Ah!

446
00:22:57,818 --> 00:23:00,584
(plates shattering)

447
00:23:00,584 --> 00:23:04,167

(Wing Nut whimpering)

451
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:18,964
- Dad?

452
00:23:21,126 --> 00:23:23,376
(thudding)

453
00:23:24,417 --> 00:23:26,455
Splat? Wake up, boy.

(sizzling)
(gasps)

460
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:54,039
- [Virtual Assistant] I'm
sorry. Will you repeat that?

461
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:54,982
- Shh.

462
00:23:54,982 --> 00:23:56,970
- [Virtual Assistant] Shh
is not on your playlist.

463
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,255
Did you mean Strauss?

464
00:23:58,255 --> 00:23:59,489
- Shh.

465
00:23:59,489 --> 00:24:00,894
- [Virtual Assistant] Playing Strauss now.

466
00:24:00,894 --> 00:24:03,847
(Wing Nut gasps)
(soft orchestral music)

467
00:24:03,847 --> 00:24:05,099

(soft orchestral music)

469
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,100

470
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,221
- Splat.

471

479
00:25:09,681 --> 00:25:10,875
(Agent 001/2 sighs)
- Thank you.

480
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:12,021

481
00:25:12,021 --> 00:25:12,938

- Who are you?

520
00:27:30,172 --> 00:27:31,063
What's going on?

521
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:37,360
- [Agent 001/2] Don't make me use this.

522
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,253
- A TV remote?

523
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,800
I don't think some
stupid TV remote's gonna-

524
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,133

A motion freezer?

528
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,160
- Oh, it does much more
than that, my little friend.

529
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,900
We have many other even
cooler items packaged in here.

530
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,160
- Who are you?

531
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:01,993
Why am I here?

532
00:28:01,993 --> 00:28:03,453
- Your government needs you.

533
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,980
- Manly Man Hair Restorers?

534
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,757
- Sorry. That was for a friend.

535
00:28:15,137 --> 00:28:16,720
- You're a T.W.I.T?

536
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,210
Never heard of it.
- And you never will.

537
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:22,293
We're so secret, we don't even exist.

538
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,160
- But you're here.
- Where?

539
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,410
- Here.
- There's no here here.

540
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:29,240
- You're not here?
- Where?

541
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,770
- You're not here, I'm not here,

542
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,030
so you've kidnapped me and taken me

543
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:35,003
to some place that's not here.

544
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:36,933
- Very good.

545
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,087
Do you have a Gooey Chewy bar?

546
00:28:39,087 --> 00:28:40,510
- And now he's hungry.

547
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,930
You picked up a Gooey Chewy
bar off the street last night.

548
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,212
- Yeah. It fell off the back
of a truck and I ate it.

549
00:28:45,212 --> 00:28:46,320
(Agent 001/2 grunts)

550
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,340
- You ate it?

551
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,420
In its entirety?

552
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,820
Oh, this is not good.
- Actually, it was great.

553
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:52,963
What's going on?

554
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:59,635
- [Agent 001/2] Meet Dr. Chuckles.

555
00:28:59,635 --> 00:29:00,468
- A clown?

556
00:29:00,468 --> 00:29:02,080
- Yes, a clown.

557
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,220
A clown who plans to destroy the upcoming

558
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,650
World Peace Conference using

559
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:08,113
this dastardly war machine here.

560
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,750
Nope, not it. Sorry.

561
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,020
Here.

562
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,370
Nope.

563
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:14,620
Not it. Here.

564
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,360
No, I thought I shaved that. Ew.

565
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,667
Here.

566
00:29:17,667 --> 00:29:19,860
Ah. The Laugh Generator.

567
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,390
He's going to broadcast
its special frequency

568
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:23,740
to every cell phone in the world

569
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,510
causing each and every citizen to break

570
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,360
into uncontrollable fits of laughter.

571
00:29:28,715 --> 00:29:29,548
(sighs)

572
00:29:29,548 --> 00:29:31,090
- What's wrong with laughter?

573
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,600
- Depends on the type.

574
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,010
There's laughter that's
innocent fun. (laughs)

575
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:38,273
Or laughter that's mean and insulting.

576
00:29:38,273 --> 00:29:41,190
(laughs deviously)

577
00:29:43,226 --> 00:29:44,059
Hm.

578
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,380
- And he's chosen the mean laughter?

579
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,650
- Yes.

580
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:50,800
And he's found a place
to unleash its power

581
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:54,403
in his diabolical plan
to destroy world peace.

582
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:56,683
Sorry.

583
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,120
- Excitement continues to build

584
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,010
as national leaders from around the globe

585
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:06,530
head for Paris and the
World Peace Conference,

586
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:09,450
where they plan to sign a special treaty

587
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,870
to finally end all wars

588
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:15,430
and initiate lasting worldwide peace.

589
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,920
All eyes around the world...

590
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,753
- But if everybody's laughing

591
00:30:18,753 --> 00:30:20,980
by playing mean jokes on each other...

592
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,400
- Welcome to World War III.

593
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:26,198
- And anticipation upon
this momentous occasion.

594
00:30:26,198 --> 00:30:27,220
- Ah, mm, thank you.

595
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,900
- We join the President now as he prepares

596
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:34,100
to depart from his pre-meeting in Germany.

597
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,510
- In preparation for this meeting,

598
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,710
the German chancellor
and I have just completed

599
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:41,495
a long and fruitful discussion.

600
00:30:41,495 --> 00:30:44,828
(tense, dramatic music)

601
00:30:47,188 --> 00:30:50,605
(quirky, dramatic music)

602
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:52,990
- Where is Wing Nut?

603
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:57,187
(quirky, tense music)

604
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:00,733
Spit it out.

605
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:02,793
Cat got your tongue?

606
00:31:04,077 --> 00:31:05,180
(whimpers)

607
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,100
(burps)
- Oh, ah!

608
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,280
- Speak man!
- He's out searching

609
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,715
for the boy.

610
00:31:08,715 --> 00:31:11,872
He's out searching for the boy.

611
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,730
(slaps)

612
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:13,600
Sorry, sir.

613
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,290
- We can wait no longer.

614
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,150
Our destiny awaits.
(cat meows)

615
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:23,150
Stand by for world domination. (laughs)

616
00:31:23,431 --> 00:31:26,427
(machines whirring)

617
00:31:26,427 --> 00:31:29,831
- Never in human history has
such a grand opportunity...

618
00:31:29,831 --> 00:31:32,130
- It's possible the bar
you ate came from a batch

619
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:34,600
especially created to protect Dr. Chuckles

620
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,240
and his goons from the frequency.

621
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:41,240
- To proceed with utmost
sobriety, and I dare say...

622
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,030
- If that's correct,
you may be the only one

623
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:46,570
in the entire planet who can stop him.

624
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:47,403
- Yeah, right.

625
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:53,370
Well, I mean even if it's
true, how could I stop him?

626
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:54,700
- By infiltrating his headquarters

627
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,814
and destroying the generator.
(alarm blaring)

628
00:31:57,814 --> 00:31:58,940
- What's that?

629
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,890
- Sensors indicate Dr.
Chuckles is preparing

630
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,340
to fire the generator.

631
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:06,479
- As I prepare to leave for
this monumentous meeting...

632
00:32:06,479 --> 00:32:07,729
- Three, two...

633
00:32:09,222 --> 00:32:11,305
(laughs)

634
00:32:13,392 --> 00:32:14,588
One.

635
00:32:14,588 --> 00:32:15,950
(blasting)

636
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:19,573
(Dr. Chuckles laughs)

637
00:32:19,573 --> 00:32:22,156
(all laughing)

638
00:32:24,021 --> 00:32:25,684
- I just wanna say...

639
00:32:25,684 --> 00:32:27,934
(laughing)

640
00:32:30,408 --> 00:32:32,223
What is that?

641
00:32:32,223 --> 00:32:34,473
(laughing)

642
00:32:35,826 --> 00:32:38,076
(laughing)

643
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,731
Tuck in, tuck in.

644
00:32:44,731 --> 00:32:46,384
Tuck in.

645
00:32:46,384 --> 00:32:48,634
(laughing)

646
00:32:50,877 --> 00:32:52,315
(thudding)

647
00:32:52,315 --> 00:32:54,398
(laughs)

648
00:32:59,495 --> 00:33:01,524
- That's terrible.
- Mm-hm.

649
00:33:01,524 --> 00:33:03,477
(Agent 001/2 laughs)

650
00:33:03,477 --> 00:33:06,144
(clears throat)

651
00:33:09,459 --> 00:33:11,926
(laughing)

652
00:33:11,926 --> 00:33:16,926
It's um, it's beginning to
affect me, too. (laughs)

653
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,213
- But...

654
00:33:20,426 --> 00:33:22,023
How are you going to stop
him? What are you going to do?

655
00:33:22,023 --> 00:33:26,982
- I mean, you're the only one
who can stop the generator.

656
00:33:26,982 --> 00:33:28,080
- But I'm just a kid. I can't-

657
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:28,940
- Hurry.

658
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,757
Save our world. (laughs)

659
00:33:32,613 --> 00:33:33,890
- You've got the wrong guy.

660
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:35,990
(Agent 001/2 laughing)

661
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,276
Dad.

662
00:33:37,276 --> 00:33:38,750
I gotta find my dad.

663
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,583
He'll know what to do.

664
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:41,314
I gotta go to the school
and I gotta find my dad.

665
00:33:41,314 --> 00:33:43,920
(Agent 001/2 laughing)

666
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,934
- Agent Dingledorf.

667
00:33:45,934 --> 00:33:50,901
You're our only hope! (laughs)

668
00:33:50,901 --> 00:33:55,818
(alarm blaring)
(laughing)

669
00:33:57,729 --> 00:33:58,646
Dingledorf.

670
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,513
(cars honking)
(officer laughs)

671
00:34:06,513 --> 00:34:07,649
- Come on, come on.

672
00:34:07,649 --> 00:34:08,870
No, no, just kidding.

673
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:09,786
Okay, okay.

674
00:34:10,829 --> 00:34:11,699
Oh, stop!

675
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:13,391
No, you, you come over.

676
00:34:13,391 --> 00:34:14,377
Come on, come on, come on.

677
00:34:14,377 --> 00:34:16,282
Come on! Come on, come on, come on.

678
00:34:16,282 --> 00:34:17,630
Whoa!

679
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:19,521
(laughing)

680
00:34:19,521 --> 00:34:21,063
Okay, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

681
00:34:21,063 --> 00:34:21,946
Whoa!

682
00:34:21,946 --> 00:34:23,797
(laughs)

683
00:34:23,797 --> 00:34:24,928
Come on, what is this?

684
00:34:24,928 --> 00:34:26,150
Is this a car? Get out of here.

685
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:28,690
- So this is happening all over the world?

686
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:30,949
People are playing mean
jokes on each other?

687
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:33,150
- And breaking into
uncontrollable laughter.

688
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:36,081
- And you're the only one who can stop it?

689
00:34:36,081 --> 00:34:38,859
(tires skid)
(crashing)

690
00:34:38,859 --> 00:34:41,257
(officer laughing)

691
00:34:41,257 --> 00:34:43,726
- Yes. That is so awesome.

692
00:34:43,726 --> 00:34:45,976
(laughing)

693
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:47,684
- You wrecked my car.

694
00:34:47,684 --> 00:34:50,329
- You were, and I was like no, no, no.

695
00:34:50,329 --> 00:34:52,579
(laughing)

696
00:34:54,445 --> 00:34:57,090
- I mean, that's what the guy
said, but how can I buy it?

697
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:59,883
I mean the whole place,
it doesn't even exist.

698
00:35:01,441 --> 00:35:02,524
(Wing Nut grunts)

699
00:35:02,524 --> 00:35:03,357
- Uh oh.

700
00:35:03,357 --> 00:35:06,450
- All because he ate one of
those stupid Gooey Chewy bars.

701
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:10,033
(quirky, mysterious music)

702
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:15,439
- Wait. We ate them, too.

703
00:35:15,439 --> 00:35:17,360
- That's right.

704
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,886
(Wing Nut grunts)

705
00:35:19,886 --> 00:35:20,719
- Ugh.

706
00:35:22,948 --> 00:35:25,538
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.

707
00:35:25,538 --> 00:35:27,540
(sighs)

708
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,443
- Cool. So we can all save the world.

709
00:35:31,605 --> 00:35:32,603
- Why am I not encouraged?

710
00:35:32,603 --> 00:35:34,353
- No, it'll be great.

711
00:35:36,943 --> 00:35:39,105
I'll have to get my own light saber.

712
00:35:39,105 --> 00:35:41,838
- IQ...
- Wear my Tarantula Man PJs.

713
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:42,987
- IQ, I don't think...

714
00:35:42,987 --> 00:35:47,621
- And I'll need, uh, my
Captain Universe shield.

715
00:35:47,621 --> 00:35:49,236
- IQ.
- Then I'll thrust

716
00:35:49,236 --> 00:35:51,479
and aerial and jibber jab!

717
00:35:51,479 --> 00:35:54,038
(Wing Nut yells)

718
00:35:54,038 --> 00:35:55,360
- IQ.
- What?

719
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,130
I'll get better with practice.

720
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:59,760
(Wing Nut yelling)

721
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,833
- Nice kitty.

722
00:36:02,109 --> 00:36:03,707
Oh, oh?

723
00:36:06,365 --> 00:36:10,700
(Wing Nut yelling)
(cat squealing)

724
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,250
- You don't think we can do it?

725
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,838
- Save the world?

726
00:36:14,838 --> 00:36:16,651
- An uncontrollable laughter (laughs)

727
00:36:16,651 --> 00:36:18,833
seems to be sweeping the world.

728
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,500
Laughter that is not just for fun,

729
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,450
but that appears to be just plain mean.

730
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,090
Reports indicate that it is...

731
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:27,923
- Hey.

732
00:36:28,816 --> 00:36:30,666
I like what you've done to the place.

733
00:36:31,631 --> 00:36:33,250
- [News Reporter] And
filters its way down.

734
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:35,196
That said, in the strange...

735
00:36:35,196 --> 00:36:36,270
(IQ gasps)

736
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:37,393
- Save the world?

737
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:39,840
We can't even make a movie.

738
00:36:42,251 --> 00:36:43,084
- [IQ] What's this?

739
00:36:43,084 --> 00:36:43,920
- Well hello there.
- Me?

740
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,840
- [Man] And welcome to secret agent

741
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,390
backpack orientation 2.4.

742
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:51,360
Among the various items
you'll learn to use

743
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,657
are our slow-mo explosive device.

744
00:36:55,497 --> 00:36:57,090
- [IQ] What?

745
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,300
No way.

746
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,123
- [Man] Our banana peel launcher.

747
00:37:01,137 --> 00:37:02,530
(IQ laughs)

748
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:04,840
- [IQ] I love bananas.

749
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,743
- [Man] Our compulsory dancing disco ball.

750
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:09,960
- [IQ] Nice.

751
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,793
Yeah.

752
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:15,283
- [Man] Our latest and
greatest gizmo, the Invisobeam.

753
00:37:16,216 --> 00:37:17,049
(IQ gasps)

754
00:37:17,049 --> 00:37:17,882
- [IQ] Invisobeam?

755
00:37:17,882 --> 00:37:19,099
But I still see him.

756
00:37:19,099 --> 00:37:19,932
(man clears throat)

757
00:37:19,932 --> 00:37:21,632
- [Man] Uh, still in development.

758
00:37:21,632 --> 00:37:23,091
- [IQ] Ah, gotcha.

759
00:37:23,091 --> 00:37:23,924
Hm.

760
00:37:23,924 --> 00:37:25,820
- [Man] And of course our standard issue

761
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,777
video cell phones socks.

762
00:37:27,777 --> 00:37:28,870
- [IQ] Cell phone socks?

763
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,730
- [Man] This video will self-destruct

764
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:35,730
in five, four, three, two, one.

765
00:37:37,648 --> 00:37:38,980
(man clears throat)

766
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:39,813
Uh one.

767
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,310
(exploding)

768
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,120
- Bernard Dingledorf.

769
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,880
This is no movie.

770
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,257
It's the real thing and
we could see real heroes!

771
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,260
- World leaders continue playing

772
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,500
their mean-spirited prank as they prepare

773
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,260
for the peace conference
in Paris. (laughs)

774
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,950
(laughing)

775
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:03,077
(alarm blaring)

776
00:38:03,077 --> 00:38:05,898
(rocket whooshing)

777
00:38:05,898 --> 00:38:08,597
(people screaming)

778
00:38:08,597 --> 00:38:11,014
(man laughs)

779
00:38:16,325 --> 00:38:19,246
(laughing)
(phone ringing)

780
00:38:19,246 --> 00:38:20,329
- Oh, oh, oh.

781
00:38:21,367 --> 00:38:22,625
Oh.

782
00:38:22,625 --> 00:38:24,217
Oh.

783
00:38:24,217 --> 00:38:25,370
(news reporter laughs)

784
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:29,990
- No one is sure where to
turn let alone seek help.

785
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:32,803
Somewhere out there, there has to be...

786
00:38:32,803 --> 00:38:35,470
(phone ringing)

787
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,473
- Hello?

788
00:38:41,473 --> 00:38:42,647
- [Agent 001/2] Agent Dinkledorf.

789
00:38:42,647 --> 00:38:44,653
- Hey Bernie! It's for you.

790
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,478
- Hello?

791
00:38:55,478 --> 00:38:57,530
(distorted laughter)

792
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:58,600
Oh. Hello?

793
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,740
- Help us, Agent Dinkledorf.

794
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:03,520
- The conference begins in 90 minutes.

795
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,437
- I'm not an agent. I'm
just, I'm just a kid.

796
00:39:06,437 --> 00:39:08,120
- 89 minutes!

797
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,987
It's all up to you. (laughs)

798
00:39:14,662 --> 00:39:17,190
- The world as we know it is over.

799
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:20,500
- Unless we really could stop him.

800
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,897
- Stop him?

801
00:39:21,897 --> 00:39:22,730
- Right.

802
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:23,563
Stop him.

803
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,983
- We just need to have a plan.

804
00:39:26,983 --> 00:39:27,893
- Great.

805
00:39:27,893 --> 00:39:31,760
A plan.
(phone dialing)

806
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,740
Do we have a plan?

807
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,573
- Maybe.

808
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,193
Rule number one, know your enemy.

809
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:40,930
Leonard Sebastian Horkelsnorken.

810
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,120
- Dr. Chuckles?

811
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,083
- Child prodigy.

812
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:47,363
- Check this out.

813
00:39:47,363 --> 00:39:49,170
At age eight, he invented
the big screen TV.

814
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:51,133
- In middle school, the first cell phone.

815
00:39:51,133 --> 00:39:52,210
- That was him? I thought it was-

816
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:54,060
- That's what they want you to think.

817
00:39:54,902 --> 00:39:55,735
(bullies laughing)

818
00:39:55,735 --> 00:39:58,703
The kids always made fun,
calling him geek-o-matic.

819
00:39:59,868 --> 00:40:01,990
(bullies laughing)

820
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:04,400
- [Bernie] Voted most likely
to wear braces until age 73.

821
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,510
- Later he earned 11 degrees at...

822
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,113
I can't tell, is that
MIT, Harvard or Yale?

823
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:12,903
- Yes.

824
00:40:14,165 --> 00:40:18,140
(quirky, dramatic music)
(shoes honking)

825
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,780
- 18 months later he presented
his greatest invention

826
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,810
to the National Academy of Sciences.

827
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:25,540
Solar power nose picker.

828
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:28,720
Unfortunately it had a little design flaw.

829
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,740
- It slipped into reverse and became-

830
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:32,773
- A solar powered snot flicker.

831
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,233
- Gross.

832
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:36,720
- Yeah.

833
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,320
- Making him the laughing
stock of the entire world.

834
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:43,767
(quirky, dramatic music)

835
00:40:46,992 --> 00:40:48,490
- So with everyone laughing,

836
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:49,900
he changed careers to become a clown.

837
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,313
- If you can't beat 'em, you join 'em.

838
00:40:52,313 --> 00:40:53,146
- At first he was the hit at

839
00:40:53,146 --> 00:40:54,710
the children's birthday parties.

840
00:40:56,276 --> 00:40:59,130
(children chattering)

841
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:01,683
- It looks just like Fluffy.

842
00:41:01,683 --> 00:41:04,263
(popping)

843
00:41:04,263 --> 00:41:06,660
After she got ran over.

844
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,553
I love you, Dr. Chuckles.

845
00:41:11,815 --> 00:41:12,648
- Aww.

846
00:41:14,384 --> 00:41:15,894
- Oh, oh, oh?

847
00:41:15,894 --> 00:41:18,857
- But then when he tried to
move up to the big league,

848
00:41:18,857 --> 00:41:22,026
to the circus, no one would take him.

849
00:41:22,026 --> 00:41:23,975
(Wing Nut yells)
(crashing)

850
00:41:23,975 --> 00:41:25,786
(grunts)

851
00:41:25,786 --> 00:41:27,657
(cat screeches)

852
00:41:27,657 --> 00:41:28,824
- Oh, come on.

853
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,170
Nice kitty.

854
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:33,963
Nice kitty.
(cat screeches)

855
00:41:33,963 --> 00:41:35,510
- He just wasn't funny enough.

856
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:38,270
- And that's when he finally cracked.

857
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:40,070
Went insane and vowed revenge,

858
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:42,620
determined to humiliate the world.

859
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,210
- With mean humor.

860
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,430
- So how's this all help us?

861
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:48,890
- Maybe if you tried to reason with him.

862
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:50,880
Remind him what his good
type of humor could do.

863
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,555
- Got to find him first.

864
00:41:52,555 --> 00:41:55,472
(doorbell ringing)

865
00:41:58,427 --> 00:41:59,982
(knocking)

866
00:41:59,982 --> 00:42:01,849
(doorbell ringing)

867
00:42:01,849 --> 00:42:04,099
(knocking)

868
00:42:08,939 --> 00:42:10,380
(nose squeaks)

869
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,970
- Congratulations.

870
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:14,520
You've just won a year's supply

871
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,800
of lactose-free, sugar-free,

872
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,355
not to mention taste free...

873
00:42:19,355 --> 00:42:21,429
(drum rolls)

874
00:42:21,429 --> 00:42:23,080
(coins pinging)

875
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,510
Ice cream bars.

876
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,910
- Are you okay?

877
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:28,853
No offense, but you look terrible.

878
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:30,863
- Allergies.

879
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,535
May I come in?

880
00:42:34,535 --> 00:42:35,368
- Hm.

881
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,303
Mm.
- Mm-mm.

882
00:42:38,752 --> 00:42:40,794
(cat meows)
(Wing Nut gasps)

883
00:42:40,794 --> 00:42:42,740
(Wing Nut chuckles)

884
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:44,550
- Do you have a cat?

885
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:45,620
- Yeah, what's wrong?

886
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,490
- A cat allergy.

887
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:50,243
I always break out in a
real bad case of claw marks.

888
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:56,400
But maybe you could come
outside, to my truck.

889
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:58,283
Make your selection there.

890
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:03,533
- Okay.

891
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:06,083
- Uh, Bernie?

892
00:43:06,943 --> 00:43:08,390
- I'll be right back.

893
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:09,240
- Right this way.

894
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:11,830
- He looks a little pale.

895
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:14,260
- [Wing Nut] Can't believe that worked.

896
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:15,380
- Wait, what?
- Hm?

897
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:16,943
Nothing.
- Needs more sun.

898
00:43:19,451 --> 00:43:22,600
(Splat barks)
(Bernie yelling)

899
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,433
Bernie!

900
00:43:23,433 --> 00:43:24,266
- [Wing Nut] Away we go!

901
00:43:27,823 --> 00:43:29,246
- Come on, come on!

902
00:43:29,246 --> 00:43:32,789
(upbeat, dramatic music)

903
00:43:32,789 --> 00:43:33,872
- Oh, look.

904
00:43:33,872 --> 00:43:35,154
Look at the children.

905
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:36,552
Would you like some ice cream?

906
00:43:36,552 --> 00:43:37,385
No!

907
00:43:37,385 --> 00:43:40,010
(laughs)

908
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:41,806
(honking)
- I need to borrow this.

909
00:43:41,806 --> 00:43:43,229
- That's mine! Hey!

910
00:43:43,229 --> 00:43:44,431
- I gotta take this.
- Hey.

911
00:43:44,431 --> 00:43:45,264
- So sorry.

912
00:43:45,264 --> 00:43:47,804
- Our parents are gonna be mad!

913
00:43:47,804 --> 00:43:49,103
- Come on, IQ!

914
00:43:49,103 --> 00:43:51,412
We have to catch up!

915
00:43:51,412 --> 00:43:52,245
Bernie!

916
00:43:53,179 --> 00:43:54,012
(splattering)

917
00:43:54,012 --> 00:43:55,403
- Get your ice cream.

918
00:43:56,491 --> 00:43:57,765
- Ugh.

919
00:43:57,765 --> 00:43:59,026
- [Wing Nut] Knock yourself out.

920
00:43:59,026 --> 00:44:00,482
- Bernie!

921
00:44:00,482 --> 00:44:03,951
(Splat panting)

922
00:44:03,951 --> 00:44:05,207
(splattering)

923
00:44:05,207 --> 00:44:07,040
- [Lens Cap] Bernie!

924
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,290
- Hey, trouble over here.

925
00:44:09,183 --> 00:44:10,760
(laughing)
(machines beeping)

926
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,963
- [Wing Nut] Our city's finest.

927
00:44:12,963 --> 00:44:14,296
- [Bernie] Help! Help me!

928
00:44:14,296 --> 00:44:16,312
Please, please!
- He's fine.

929
00:44:16,312 --> 00:44:17,145
(officers laughing)

930
00:44:17,145 --> 00:44:18,041
- [Lens Cap] Wait up!

931
00:44:18,041 --> 00:44:21,041
(officers laughing)

932
00:44:21,876 --> 00:44:24,794
We gotta go faster!
(Wing Nut laughs)

933
00:44:24,794 --> 00:44:26,281
- [Wing Nut] Come on, slowpokes.

934
00:44:26,281 --> 00:44:27,226
- [Lens Cap] Get back here!

935
00:44:27,226 --> 00:44:29,144
- [Bernie] Where are you taking me?

936
00:44:29,144 --> 00:44:31,198
- [Lens Cap] We're gaining on him!

937
00:44:31,198 --> 00:44:34,077
You go left, I'll close in on the right.

938
00:44:34,077 --> 00:44:35,354
- Right!

939
00:44:35,354 --> 00:44:36,727
- No, left!

940
00:44:36,727 --> 00:44:37,687
- What?

941
00:44:37,687 --> 00:44:38,520
- Go left!

942
00:44:40,125 --> 00:44:41,413
- Mine or yours?

943
00:44:41,413 --> 00:44:42,899
- It's the same thing!

944
00:44:42,899 --> 00:44:44,256
- Same thing?

945
00:44:44,256 --> 00:44:46,321
(upbeat pop rock music)

946
00:44:46,321 --> 00:44:47,466
- Right here.

947
00:44:47,466 --> 00:44:48,749
- [Bernie] Lens Cap!

948
00:44:48,749 --> 00:44:49,594
(Wing Nut laughing)

949
00:44:49,594 --> 00:44:50,427
IQ!

950
00:44:51,699 --> 00:44:52,763
- [Wing Nut] Brace yourselves.

951
00:44:52,763 --> 00:44:54,045
- You sure this is gonna work?

952
00:44:54,045 --> 00:44:55,317
- Of course not.

953
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:56,662
- Great.

954
00:44:56,662 --> 00:44:57,495
(Wing Nut laughing)

955
00:44:57,495 --> 00:44:58,889
- [Bernie] Please don't, please don't.

956
00:44:58,889 --> 00:45:00,499
- Ready?

957
00:45:00,499 --> 00:45:02,951
Steady.
(Wing Nut laughing)

958
00:45:02,951 --> 00:45:05,305
If we die, you'll live to regret this!

959
00:45:05,305 --> 00:45:07,001
(Wing Nut laughing)

960
00:45:07,001 --> 00:45:09,814
(golf cart puttering)
- What?

961
00:45:09,814 --> 00:45:10,647
What?

962
00:45:10,647 --> 00:45:11,552
What?

963
00:45:11,552 --> 00:45:12,385
Oh.

964
00:45:13,536 --> 00:45:15,404
(Lens Cap laughs)

965
00:45:15,404 --> 00:45:18,942
(Wing Nut grumbling)
(hitting)

966
00:45:18,942 --> 00:45:21,275
(whooshing)

967
00:45:23,849 --> 00:45:26,849
(Wing Nut chuckles)

968
00:45:28,835 --> 00:45:30,436
(mumbles)

969
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:31,897
(thuds)

970
00:45:31,897 --> 00:45:33,867
(Splat pants)

971
00:45:33,867 --> 00:45:38,867
(Wing Nut mumbling)
(soft lullaby music)

972
00:45:39,996 --> 00:45:42,199
I think, I think...

973
00:45:42,199 --> 00:45:43,547
I think I'll just...

974
00:45:43,547 --> 00:45:45,547
I'm just gonna sit down.

975
00:45:46,888 --> 00:45:48,555
- [Bernie] Untie me.

976
00:45:51,016 --> 00:45:52,682
- Are you okay?

977
00:45:52,682 --> 00:45:53,515
- Yeah.

978
00:45:53,515 --> 00:45:55,176
Yeah, I'm good.

979
00:45:55,176 --> 00:45:56,710
IQ, what are you doing?

980
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:58,363
- It was under the seat.

981
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:00,733
- Come on.

982
00:46:02,737 --> 00:46:03,947
- Come on. Go, go, go.

983
00:46:03,947 --> 00:46:05,480
I'm driving. Move over.

984
00:46:08,767 --> 00:46:11,668
- [Bernie] You guys, come on.

985
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:14,375
(upbeat music)

986
00:46:14,375 --> 00:46:16,494
- [Lens Cap] Nice and easy.

987
00:46:16,494 --> 00:46:19,577
(soft, upbeat music)

988
00:46:23,428 --> 00:46:25,140
- Where are we going?
- GPS.

989
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:26,650
- I know what we are,
but where are we going?

990
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:28,110
- GPS.

991
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:29,480
- He was our only clue.

992
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,480
- GPS.

993
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,184
- Great.
- GPS!

994
00:46:32,184 --> 00:46:33,420
Home. GPS.

995
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:36,077
- I know where home is, I just...

996
00:46:37,474 --> 00:46:38,900
Oh.

997
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:39,933
His home.
- Mm-hm.

998
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:41,980
- IQ, you're a genius.

999
00:46:46,389 --> 00:46:47,441
- All right.

1000
00:46:47,441 --> 00:46:48,358
Here we go.

1001
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:52,320
- Now what?

1002
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,433
- [Bernie] Maybe they got
a key hidden somewhere?

1003
00:46:55,738 --> 00:46:57,638
- Or we could try calling a locksmith.

1004
00:46:59,243 --> 00:47:00,076
(doorbell rings)

1005
00:47:00,076 --> 00:47:01,430
Or that.

1006
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:03,420
- [Man] Good afternoon, jokesters.

1007
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,460
Today's security question is

1008
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:06,920
what's the last thing to go through

1009
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,693
a grasshopper's mind when
he hits the windshield?

1010
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,910
You have 60 seconds.

1011
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:14,230
- Um, uh...

1012
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:15,547
- The last thing to go
through a grasshopper's mind-

1013
00:47:15,547 --> 00:47:16,580
- Right, right.

1014
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:17,560
Um.

1015
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:18,770
- I know, I know.

1016
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:20,860
I bet this is going to leave a mark?

1017
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:21,831
- Really?

1018
00:47:21,831 --> 00:47:24,170
(spraying)
(quirky music)

1019
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:25,310
- [Man] Your answer is incorrect.

1020
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:28,118
You now have 41 seconds.

1021
00:47:28,118 --> 00:47:30,133
- Uh, uh-
- Think of something!

1022
00:47:30,133 --> 00:47:32,460
- Well, I don't know, I
should've bought life insurance?

1023
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:34,208
- Oh, that's a lot better.

1024
00:47:34,208 --> 00:47:35,350
(spraying)
(quirky music)

1025
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:37,041
- [Man] Incorrect. You have 32 seconds.

1026
00:47:37,041 --> 00:47:37,874
- Uh...

1027
00:47:37,874 --> 00:47:39,442
So you wanna play chicken do you?

1028
00:47:39,442 --> 00:47:40,275
(buzzing)
- Clear the runway,

1029
00:47:40,275 --> 00:47:41,582
I'm coming in hot?
(buzzing)

1030
00:47:41,582 --> 00:47:42,860
- Call the society for Prevention

1031
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,139
of Cruelty to Insects?
(buzzing)

1032
00:47:45,139 --> 00:47:46,361
- Guys!

1033
00:47:46,361 --> 00:47:47,785
- [Man] You have 12 seconds.

1034
00:47:47,785 --> 00:47:49,385
- I know, I know, I know!

1035
00:47:49,385 --> 00:47:50,218
Butt!

1036
00:47:50,218 --> 00:47:51,051
- [Man] Nine seconds.

1037
00:47:51,051 --> 00:47:52,009
- Can't you be any funnier?
- Can't you?

1038
00:47:52,009 --> 00:47:52,842
- Butt.

1039
00:47:52,842 --> 00:47:54,080
- But what?
- But what?

1040
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,413
- The last thing that goes through

1041
00:47:55,413 --> 00:47:57,320
a grasshopper's mind after hitting

1042
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,700
the windshield is his butt.

1043
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:00,969
Like your tushy.

1044
00:48:00,969 --> 00:48:01,900
(man laughs)

1045
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:03,620
- [Man] That's correct. (laughs)

1046
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:06,091
What a crack up. (laughs)

1047
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:08,957
Please, enter.

1048
00:48:08,957 --> 00:48:10,707
And don't forget to wipe your feet.

1049
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,353
I said don't forget

1050
00:48:15,353 --> 00:48:16,970
to wipe your feet.
- Oh!

1051
00:48:17,896 --> 00:48:19,904
- [Man] Thank you.

1052
00:48:19,904 --> 00:48:23,279
- [Lens Cap] Okay?

1053
00:48:23,279 --> 00:48:25,601
- I need to find that generator.

1054
00:48:25,601 --> 00:48:27,625
(Splat barks)

1055
00:48:27,625 --> 00:48:31,511
(creepy carnival music)

1056
00:48:31,511 --> 00:48:32,428
Which door?

1057
00:48:33,352 --> 00:48:37,148
(growling)
- Not that one.

1058
00:48:37,148 --> 00:48:40,942
(feet thudding)
(upbeat marching music)

1059
00:48:40,942 --> 00:48:43,417
(Splat sniffing)

1060
00:48:43,417 --> 00:48:45,750
- [IQ] What'd you find, boy?

1061
00:48:47,807 --> 00:48:49,832
(train horn blares)

1062
00:48:49,832 --> 00:48:50,784
(gasps)

1063
00:48:50,784 --> 00:48:55,784
(creatures growling)
(Bernie whimpering)

1064
00:48:58,187 --> 00:48:59,924
- Honestly, that is so fake-

1065
00:48:59,924 --> 00:49:01,501
(elephant trumpets)
(splashing)

1066
00:49:01,501 --> 00:49:03,081
(woman screams)
- Sorry!

1067
00:49:03,081 --> 00:49:04,772
(woman screams)

1068
00:49:04,772 --> 00:49:08,783
(creepy carnival music)

1069
00:49:08,783 --> 00:49:10,574
(machine whirring)

1070
00:49:10,574 --> 00:49:12,741
- Guys, I found something.

1071
00:49:13,613 --> 00:49:14,446
Whoa.

1072
00:49:14,446 --> 00:49:16,824
- [Announcer] Welcome to
the coaster experience.

1073
00:49:16,824 --> 00:49:18,937
- [Lens Cap] What did you do?

1074
00:49:18,937 --> 00:49:19,770
- Cool!

1075
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:21,400
- [Announcer] Please
keep your hands and arms

1076
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,010
inside the vehicle at all times.

1077
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:25,010
- A roller coaster.

1078
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:27,116
IQ, don't.

1079
00:49:27,116 --> 00:49:28,345
- Come on!

1080
00:49:28,345 --> 00:49:30,800
(announcer speaks in foreign language)

1081
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,426
(Splat barks)
Come on, Splat, let's go.

1082
00:49:33,426 --> 00:49:34,735
(Splat panting)

1083
00:49:34,735 --> 00:49:37,125
This'll be awesome.

1084
00:49:37,125 --> 00:49:40,172
- [Announcer] Coaster departing in five,

1085
00:49:40,172 --> 00:49:41,586
four,

1086
00:49:41,586 --> 00:49:42,837

- What the?

1092
00:49:59,897 --> 00:50:02,417
- [Announcer] I told you,
keep your hands and arms

1093
00:50:02,417 --> 00:50:04,648
inside the vehicle at all times.

1094
00:50:04,648 --> 00:50:05,720
- [Bernie] Splat, you okay, buddy?

1095
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,045
(Splat grunts)

1096

- [IQ] Come on, Splat.

1101
00:50:22,576 --> 00:50:23,932
- [Alarm Announcer]
Warning, warning, warning.

1102
00:50:23,932 --> 00:50:25,719
There are numerous humans.

1103
00:50:25,719 --> 00:50:27,886
There are numerous humans.

1104
00:50:28,939 --> 00:50:29,772
(IQ chuckles)

1105
00:50:29,772 --> 00:50:31,272
- Hello?

1106
00:50:31,272 --> 00:50:32,105
Hello?

1107
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:35,053
Hello?

1108
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,403
Anyone there?

1109
00:50:41,718 --> 00:50:43,875
(clowns laughing)

1110
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:45,314
- [Clown 1] Look out!

1111
00:50:45,314 --> 00:50:46,279
- [Clown 2] Road hog!

1112
00:50:46,279 --> 00:50:47,501
- Bernie?

1113
00:50:47,501 --> 00:50:48,676
- [Clown 3] Use your signal!

1114
00:50:48,676 --> 00:50:53,641
(clowns chattering)
(laughing)

1115
00:50:53,641 --> 00:50:54,773
- [Bernie] What are you doing?

1116
00:50:54,773 --> 00:50:55,606
- [IQ] Checking.

1117
00:50:55,606 --> 00:50:57,364
(clowns chattering)

1118
00:50:57,364 --> 00:50:58,197
- Hurry.

1119
00:51:00,383 --> 00:51:02,550
- [Clown 4] Let's get 'em!

1120
00:51:03,751 --> 00:51:04,584
- Cool!

1121
00:51:04,584 --> 00:51:05,965
- Guys, we gotta go, we gotta go!

1122
00:51:05,965 --> 00:51:07,014
Come on!

1123
00:51:07,014 --> 00:51:08,914
- [Man] Wrong way to Dr. Chuckles.

1124
00:51:08,914 --> 00:51:10,247
Why would I lie?

1125
00:51:12,254 --> 00:51:14,277
- Aw, nice kitty kitty ki-
(lion roars)

1126
00:51:14,277 --> 00:51:15,797
- Come on!

1127
00:51:15,797 --> 00:51:19,047
(upbeat, quirky music)

1128
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:23,403
(alarm blaring)

1129
00:51:23,403 --> 00:51:25,420
- What is this place?

1130
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:27,830
- [Dr. Chuckles] Well, hi there.

1131
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:29,580
(Len Cap gasps)
- Dr. Chuckles.

1132
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:30,710
- Present.

1133
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:32,192
- Where are you?

1134
00:51:32,192 --> 00:51:33,190
- Where are we?

1135
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:36,510
- In a very special room. (laughs)

1136
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,220
You'll find out soon enough.

1137
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:41,020
I must say I was very impressed with you

1138
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:43,810
getting through my living
defenses and finding me.

1139
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:44,873
- Thanks. It wasn't that big of a-

1140
00:51:44,873 --> 00:51:47,330
- I could really use you on my team.

1141
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:48,370
- Team?
- You know, to help

1142
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:53,370
with the little details, like,
you know, ruling the world.

1143
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:55,400
- We would never work for you.

1144
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,403
- Is there any pay?

1145
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,890
- There's nothing wrong with laughter.

1146
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:01,790
- Not if you're laughing with someone.

1147
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:06,280
But if you're laughing at
them, that's just plain-

1148
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,310
- Mean?

1149
00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:08,143
- Right.

1150
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:13,198
And my dad said that we should
honor and respect people-

1151
00:52:13,198 --> 00:52:14,031
- Blah blah blah blah.

1152
00:52:14,031 --> 00:52:15,630
Yes, your poor father, oh, oh.

1153
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:18,543
Speaking of which, let's
check in on him, shall we?

1154
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:24,680
(Paul laughing)
(people screaming)

1155
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:27,640
And by the way your entire
school is under my powers.

1156
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:30,410
The teachers have all gone crazy.

1157
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:31,811
- You free my dad, you jerk!

1158
00:52:31,811 --> 00:52:33,640
(electric buzzing)

1159
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,428
- [Dr. Chuckles] Excellent.

1160
00:52:35,428 --> 00:52:36,570
- [Lens Cap] What was that?

1161
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:39,330
- [Dr. Chuckles] You tell me. (laughs)

1162
00:52:39,330 --> 00:52:41,427
- I'm not sure what
makes you such a creep,

1163
00:52:41,427 --> 00:52:43,630
but it really seems to be working.

1164
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:45,943
- What's going on?

1165
00:52:45,943 --> 00:52:47,470
- Now who's being mean?

1166
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:51,220
Your meanness is creating
your own special prison.

1167
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:52,053
- What?

1168
00:52:52,053 --> 00:52:55,650
- Your rudeness is no different
from my own comic genius.

1169
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:56,850
- You're not a comic genius.

1170
00:52:56,850 --> 00:52:58,800
You're a comic goofus.

1171
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,800
- Um guys...

1172
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,760
- If laughter was the best medicine,

1173
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:05,478
your face would cure the world. (laughs)

1174
00:53:05,478 --> 00:53:07,423
(Dr. Chuckles laughing)

1175
00:53:07,423 --> 00:53:09,756
- Welcome to my insult room.

1176
00:53:11,199 --> 00:53:12,660
(buzzing)
You can cry all you want.

1177
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:15,165
There's no escaping...

1178
00:53:15,165 --> 00:53:18,493
Until, of course, you choose to join me.

1179
00:53:19,985 --> 00:53:22,840
(pinging)

1180
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:23,853
- Look at me, Doc.

1181
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:30,030
Beat up, depressed, under
appreciated by Chuckles.

1182
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:34,253
I just feel like my life
isn't going anywhere.

1183
00:53:35,870 --> 00:53:36,720
What should I do?

1184
00:53:38,349 --> 00:53:39,182
Oh.

1185
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:40,073
What's bothering me?

1186
00:53:41,007 --> 00:53:42,750
(Wing Nut sighs)

1187
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:43,863
It's the boss.

1188
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:48,983
Oh sure. He, he acts
bad, but on the inside?

1189
00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:54,143
I worry he's too good to be bad.

1190
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,080
What do you think?

1191
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,700
Do you really think he's evil enough

1192
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:02,043
to take over the whole world?

1193
00:54:02,043 --> 00:54:05,373
(squelching)
(pinging)

1194
00:54:05,373 --> 00:54:06,403
Exactly.

1195
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:10,573
Do you know he once tried
to use his humor for good?

1196
00:54:12,313 --> 00:54:13,647
Mm-hm.

1197
00:54:13,647 --> 00:54:15,713
And that cat he's always doting on?

1198
00:54:16,606 --> 00:54:17,439
(cat screeches)

1199
00:54:17,439 --> 00:54:20,793
Anyone who loves animals can't be all bad.

1200
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:25,363
Perhaps...

1201
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:28,623
We need a new leader.

1202
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:33,883
Someone more focused on being bad.

1203
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,893
Someone intelligent.

1204
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:39,493
Good-looking.

1205
00:54:40,741 --> 00:54:42,543
A real clown among clowns.

1206
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:47,523
Now, who might that be?

1207
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:55,582
Who could that be?

1208
00:54:55,582 --> 00:54:57,100
Me!

1209
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:58,533
It's me, you clown!

1210
00:55:00,234 --> 00:55:01,569
(sighs)
(chuckles)

1211
00:55:01,569 --> 00:55:02,402
Yes.

1212
00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:08,650
Oh, I'm so glad you agree. (chuckles)

1213
00:55:08,650 --> 00:55:10,010
Well I really feel a lot better, Doc.

1214
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:10,913
Thank you so much.

1215
00:55:12,906 --> 00:55:15,989
(soft, quirky music)

1216
00:55:17,361 --> 00:55:18,194
Oh.

1217
00:55:30,522 --> 00:55:32,760
(Wing Nut grunting)

1218
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:33,973
Excuse me.

1219
00:55:33,973 --> 00:55:35,500
(grunting)

1220
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,420
- [Dr. Chuckles] Wing Nut?

1221
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:40,407
Get back and guard the insult room.

1222
00:55:40,407 --> 00:55:41,713
(Wing Nut sighs)
Now!

1223
00:55:46,045 --> 00:55:48,520
(staticky buzzing)
Keep an eye on them.

1224
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:49,360
- Yes, sir.

1225
00:55:51,108 --> 00:55:54,025
(staticky buzzing)

1226
00:55:54,998 --> 00:55:56,520
- What have we done?

1227
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,430
- We're no better than he is.

1228
00:55:58,430 --> 00:55:59,911
- Just not as ugly.

1229
00:55:59,911 --> 00:56:01,031
(staticky buzzing)

1230
00:56:01,031 --> 00:56:02,101
- IQ!
- IQ!

1231
00:56:02,101 --> 00:56:05,300
(staticky buzzing)

1232
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,900
- [Lens Cap] Guess we won't
be needing this anymore.

1233
00:56:09,486 --> 00:56:11,781
(staticky buzzing)

1234
00:56:11,781 --> 00:56:14,448
(phone ringing)

1235
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,720
- Your feet are ringing.

1236
00:56:18,730 --> 00:56:20,315
- Hello?

1237
00:56:20,315 --> 00:56:22,120
(Agent 001/2 laughing)

1238
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,390
It's for you.

1239
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:25,223
Let me put it on sneaker phone.

1240
00:56:26,961 --> 00:56:29,025
(Agent 001/2 laughing)

1241
00:56:29,025 --> 00:56:31,496
- [Agent 001/2] Secret Agent Dingledorf.

1242
00:56:31,496 --> 00:56:32,986
- I told you, I'm not a...

1243
00:56:32,986 --> 00:56:37,406
- The leaders have
arrived in Paris. (laughs)

1244
00:56:37,406 --> 00:56:40,644
(soft, upbeat French music)

1245
00:56:40,644 --> 00:56:42,894
(laughing)

1246
00:56:44,823 --> 00:56:47,577
- Woo-woo. (laughs)

1247
00:56:47,577 --> 00:56:50,062
(blowtorch buzzing)

1248
00:56:50,062 --> 00:56:51,853
(laughing)

1249
00:56:51,853 --> 00:56:53,033
(tower creaks)

1250
00:56:53,033 --> 00:56:55,486
(laughing)

1251
00:56:55,486 --> 00:56:57,472
- The conference begins within the hour.

1252
00:56:57,472 --> 00:56:59,862
(laughs)
(silly string spraying)

1253
00:56:59,862 --> 00:57:02,327
- I told you from the start,
you've got the wrong person.

1254
00:57:02,327 --> 00:57:04,826
- Oh, and your dad called.

1255
00:57:04,826 --> 00:57:06,480
He wanted me to give you a message.

1256
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,760
Something about... (laughs)

1257
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:10,787
Junk.

1258
00:57:10,787 --> 00:57:12,870
(laughs)

1259
00:57:15,054 --> 00:57:18,395
- Like we're ever gonna break out of here.

1260
00:57:18,395 --> 00:57:20,621
(staticky buzzing)

1261
00:57:20,621 --> 00:57:21,609
- And what are you gonna do...

1262
00:57:21,609 --> 00:57:22,645
(Bernie grunts)

1263
00:57:22,645 --> 00:57:23,478
(thudding)

1264
00:57:23,478 --> 00:57:24,395
If I don't?

1265
00:57:25,341 --> 00:57:26,174
(Russell laughs)

1266
00:57:26,174 --> 00:57:29,000
- [Bernie] Don't you ever
get tired of being a nobody?

1267
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,940
- Everyone has value, son.

1268
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:32,240
God, he doesn't make junk.

1269
00:57:33,197 --> 00:57:35,996
(staticky buzzing)

1270
00:57:35,996 --> 00:57:36,829
- Dad.

1271
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:38,513
Junk.

1272
00:57:38,513 --> 00:57:39,800
Junk.

1273
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,053
God doesn't make junk.

1274
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:44,668
- You're getting pretty
good with all that stuff.

1275
00:57:44,668 --> 00:57:46,520
(staticky buzzing)

1276
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,150
Did you see that?

1277
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:48,983
- Yeah.

1278
00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:52,160
Hey, IQ.

1279
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,133
You know, you're one smart guy.

1280
00:57:54,133 --> 00:57:55,070
(staticky buzzing)

1281
00:57:55,070 --> 00:57:56,955
- And you're a great judge of character.

1282
00:57:56,955 --> 00:57:58,800
(staticky buzzing)

1283
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,560
- Hey Lens Cap, did I ever tell you

1284
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,760
what a great filmmaker you are?

1285
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,448
- Stop that.

1286
00:58:03,448 --> 00:58:05,900
- No, but I trust your opinion of me

1287
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:08,910
since you're so smart and highly informed.

1288
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:10,430
- Highly informed?

1289
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:11,354
- I know what you're doing.

1290
00:58:11,354 --> 00:58:12,240
- Sure.

1291
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,840
He's intelligent...

1292
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:16,930
And a great friend.

1293
00:58:18,454 --> 00:58:19,600
- Stop that!

1294
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:20,860
- Thanks.

1295
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:22,470
You're a good friend, too.

1296
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:24,469
- We're all good friends.

1297
00:58:24,469 --> 00:58:26,105
And we're smart, too.

1298
00:58:26,105 --> 00:58:27,575
(staticky buzzing)
(Lens Cap gasps)

1299
00:58:27,575 --> 00:58:30,673
- Come on, let's go.

1300
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:32,066
- Clown code red.

1301
00:58:32,066 --> 00:58:33,242
Clown code red.

1302
00:58:33,242 --> 00:58:34,702
- [Bernie] Hurry, they're gaining.

1303
00:58:34,702 --> 00:58:35,580
- [IQ] I'm trying!

1304
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:37,827
- [Bernie] The backpack,
anything else you got in there?

1305
00:58:37,827 --> 00:58:41,860
- Uh, laser nail Clippers,
rocket powered shoe laces.

1306
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:44,532
Ooh, x-ray glasses.

1307
00:58:44,532 --> 00:58:46,810
(chuckles)

1308
00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:48,180
- [Bernie] Come on, any time.

1309
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:49,177
(clowns laughing)

1310
00:58:49,177 --> 00:58:50,956
(whooshing)

1311
00:58:50,956 --> 00:58:52,056
- [IQ] I love bananas.

1312
00:58:52,971 --> 00:58:54,554
- [Bernie] Come on.

1313
00:58:55,591 --> 00:58:57,421
You guys, come on.
- Come on!

1314
00:58:57,421 --> 00:58:59,204
(clowns chattering)

1315
00:58:59,204 --> 00:59:01,204
- I thought it'd be a little more roomy.

1316
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:03,473
- Breath mints?

1317
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:04,410
Anyone?
(pounding on door)

1318
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:05,323
- No thanks.

1319
00:59:06,877 --> 00:59:07,710
What?

1320
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:09,533
- Guys, ideas?

1321
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,750
Anyone?
(pounding on door)

1322
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:14,780
- You said I was a great filmmaker.

1323
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:15,613
Right?

1324
00:59:15,613 --> 00:59:16,446
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1325
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:19,400
- Play along with me here.

1326
00:59:20,624 --> 00:59:21,993
(pounding on door)

1327
00:59:21,993 --> 00:59:23,358
(clowns exclaim)
Cut!

1328
00:59:23,358 --> 00:59:24,359
Cut!

1329
00:59:24,359 --> 00:59:25,192
Cut!

1330
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:29,462
Congratulations. You've
all passed the audition.

1331
00:59:29,462 --> 00:59:30,420
- [Clown] What?

1332
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:31,620
- For the new reality show.

1333
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:32,670
They didn't tell you?

1334
00:59:33,701 --> 00:59:34,534
Ugh.

1335
00:59:34,534 --> 00:59:35,510
Figures.

1336
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:38,329
Clowns Gone Wild on Nerdflix this fall.

1337
00:59:38,329 --> 00:59:40,183
You're all gonna be stars.

1338
00:59:40,183 --> 00:59:41,750
Love that look, sweetheart.

1339
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:43,176
Don't change a thing.

1340
00:59:43,176 --> 00:59:45,450
Okay everybody, gather
in for a group photo.

1341
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:47,499
Come on, let's go.

1342
00:59:47,499 --> 00:59:49,139
The camera loves you, kid. Uh-huh.

1343
00:59:49,139 --> 00:59:50,250
Yeah, keep it goin'.

1344
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:51,844
Yep, come on, there we go.

1345
00:59:51,844 --> 00:59:53,850
Nice and close. Okay.

1346
00:59:53,850 --> 00:59:55,038
All set?

1347
00:59:55,038 --> 00:59:55,955
And action.

1348
00:59:56,930 --> 00:59:59,182
(door slams)
(clowns exclaim)

1349
00:59:59,182 --> 01:00:00,015
Come on!

1350
01:00:02,727 --> 01:00:04,092
- [Clown 2] Aww.

1351
01:00:04,092 --> 01:00:06,666
(clowns chattering)

1352
01:00:06,666 --> 01:00:07,833
- Go, go, go.
- IQ!

1353
01:00:07,833 --> 01:00:09,353
The backpack.

1354
01:00:09,353 --> 01:00:10,234
Make it melt!

1355
01:00:10,234 --> 01:00:11,067
- Right.

1356
01:00:12,263 --> 01:00:13,096
- Hurry.

1357
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:18,063
That'll work.

1358
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:19,930
- [Bernie] Come on!

1359
01:00:20,930 --> 01:00:23,763
(clowns shouting)

1360
01:00:24,873 --> 01:00:29,873
(machine whirring)
(staticky buzzing)

1361
01:00:32,268 --> 01:00:33,243
Whoa.

1362
01:00:34,647 --> 01:00:37,397
(Splat sniffing)

1363
01:00:38,817 --> 01:00:42,884
(clowns chattering)
(bright, upbeat music)

1364
01:00:42,884 --> 01:00:44,040
How do we shut it down?

1365
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,570
- [Lens Cap] It's a bunch
of those giggle guns

1366
01:00:45,570 --> 01:00:46,470
wired and parallel.

1367
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:48,667
- Making one giant super charged one.

1368
01:00:49,736 --> 01:00:51,993
- If we can disconnect enough of them,

1369
01:00:51,993 --> 01:00:55,012
I bet we can disable it and...

1370
01:00:55,012 --> 01:00:56,679
- [Bernie] Chuckles.

1371
01:00:57,971 --> 01:00:59,140
(booming)

1372
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:00,390
IQ!
- I'm on it.

1373
01:01:02,629 --> 01:01:03,903
- [Bernie] Hurry!

1374
01:01:03,903 --> 01:01:06,736
(clowns shouting)

1375
01:01:14,453 --> 01:01:15,317
(whooshing)

1376
01:01:15,317 --> 01:01:18,483
IQ, come on.
- He's trying to get ahead.

1377
01:01:18,483 --> 01:01:20,529
- [IQ] Coming through!

1378
01:01:20,529 --> 01:01:21,775
(thudding)

1379
01:01:21,775 --> 01:01:22,608
Bernie, go!

1380
01:01:22,608 --> 01:01:25,591
(Bernie gasps)

1381
01:01:25,591 --> 01:01:27,151
- [Clown 1] Where'd they go?

1382
01:01:27,151 --> 01:01:28,930
- [Bernie] IQ.

1383
01:01:28,930 --> 01:01:31,355
(clowns shouting)

1384
01:01:31,355 --> 01:01:32,193
Can they see me?

1385
01:01:32,193 --> 01:01:33,026
- Eh?

1386
01:01:36,070 --> 01:01:41,070
(clowns chattering)
(tense, upbeat music)

1387
01:01:50,372 --> 01:01:52,289
- IQ, come on, I'm ahead of ya.

1388
01:01:52,289 --> 01:01:54,024
- [IQ] He's right behind you! Look out!

1389
01:01:54,024 --> 01:01:57,829
- IQ!
(whooshing)

1390
01:01:57,829 --> 01:01:59,543
(Bernie grunts)

1391
01:01:59,543 --> 01:02:01,126
A little help here.

1392
01:02:04,809 --> 01:02:05,744
Nice job, IQ.

1393
01:02:05,744 --> 01:02:10,744
(pinging)
(clowns chattering)

1394
01:02:22,763 --> 01:02:25,459
- Hey! Get down from there.

1395
01:02:25,459 --> 01:02:26,735
- IQ!

1396
01:02:26,735 --> 01:02:27,677
Help!

1397
01:02:27,677 --> 01:02:32,677
(pinging)
(clowns chattering)

1398
01:02:33,921 --> 01:02:35,254
- Bernie, catch!

1399
01:02:44,187 --> 01:02:46,610
(cat meows)

1400
01:02:46,610 --> 01:02:50,403
- You're too late, Dingledork. (laughs)

1401
01:02:54,361 --> 01:02:55,194
(exploding)

1402
01:02:55,194 --> 01:02:57,444
(laughing)

1403
01:02:59,349 --> 01:03:04,349
(spraying)
(President laughing)

1404
01:03:08,186 --> 01:03:09,019
- No.

1405
01:03:09,019 --> 01:03:10,793
They'll never sign the treaty now

1406
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,303
and there's nothing you can do about it.

1407
01:03:15,334 --> 01:03:17,520
(world leaders laughing)

1408
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:18,370
- Really?

1409
01:03:18,370 --> 01:03:21,000
- Wait. What are you doing?

1410
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,601
You don't know what that can do.

1411
01:03:22,601 --> 01:03:23,990
(gun cocks)
- I have a pretty good idea.

1412
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:24,823
- No, wait.

1413
01:03:24,823 --> 01:03:25,790
Listen, let's...

1414
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:28,362
Let's talk.

1415
01:03:28,362 --> 01:03:29,630
- I think a good laugh
would be better, don't you?

1416
01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:30,610
- Wait, wait, please.

1417
01:03:30,610 --> 01:03:31,543
No, no, listen.

1418
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:34,963
- I hate laughter.

1419
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:41,790
I even tried to be funny
once, at the circus.

1420
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:43,013
- We saw the pictures.

1421
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:46,660
- People made fun of me,

1422
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:50,973
told me I was worthless.

1423
01:03:52,218 --> 01:03:53,700
- No.

1424
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:54,973
Nobody's worthless.

1425
01:03:56,343 --> 01:03:57,580
(quirky music)

1426
01:03:57,580 --> 01:03:59,180
- It was terrible.

1427
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:02,493
It was humiliating.

1428
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:06,015
I was good for nothing.

1429
01:04:06,015 --> 01:04:06,848
- No.

1430
01:04:06,848 --> 01:04:08,183
God doesn't make junk.

1431
01:04:09,753 --> 01:04:11,587
Maybe you were just
trying at the wrong place.

1432
01:04:11,587 --> 01:04:12,420
- Hm.

1433
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:14,560
Yeah, dingleberry.

1434
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,580
Well I'm in the right place now.

1435
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:18,190
- No, please, please.

1436
01:04:18,190 --> 01:04:19,503
The world needs your ge-

1437
01:04:21,202 --> 01:04:23,452
(laughing)

1438
01:04:24,370 --> 01:04:26,990
Is this how you want the
world to remember you?

1439
01:04:26,990 --> 01:04:31,018
- They must suffer they
way they made me suffer.

1440
01:04:31,018 --> 01:04:33,685
(Bernie laughs)

1441
01:04:34,927 --> 01:04:36,531
What are you doing?

1442
01:04:36,531 --> 01:04:37,970
What is that?

1443
01:04:37,970 --> 01:04:39,090
What are you doing?
(Bernie laughing)

1444
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:40,240
Hey.

1445
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,587
Let's see if we can make a big one.

1446
01:04:43,624 --> 01:04:45,956
- [Children] Whoa!

1447
01:04:45,956 --> 01:04:47,242
(laughing)

1448
01:04:47,242 --> 01:04:48,735
- Look what you could do.

1449
01:04:48,735 --> 01:04:50,652
Look what you could do.

1450
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:54,930
- No, they're just kids.

1451
01:04:54,930 --> 01:04:56,113
- Look at their joy.

1452
01:04:57,325 --> 01:05:00,030
(Bernie laughs)

1453
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:01,730
Look at the happiness you brought.

1454
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:06,413
This is who you are. (laughs)

1455
01:05:07,689 --> 01:05:09,853
- I love you, Dr. Chuckles.

1456
01:05:09,853 --> 01:05:11,953
- [Dr. Chuckles] I love you too, Princess.

1457
01:05:15,619 --> 01:05:20,619
(clowns shouting)
(quirky, upbeat music)

1458
01:05:28,857 --> 01:05:29,690
- Uh oh.

1459
01:05:30,764 --> 01:05:32,455
(clowns shouting)

1460
01:05:32,455 --> 01:05:33,309
(IQ grumbles)

1461
01:05:33,309 --> 01:05:35,438
- [IQ] This thing...

1462
01:05:35,438 --> 01:05:40,438
(clowns shouting)
(upbeat, quirky music)

1463
01:05:47,474 --> 01:05:48,307
(Bernie laughs)

1464
01:05:48,307 --> 01:05:49,993
- That makes it look like so

1465
01:05:49,993 --> 01:05:53,620
and make it look just like this right here

1466
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:55,843
and all of a sudden then we have

1467
01:05:55,843 --> 01:05:58,219
a Dr. Chuckles clown pizza.

1468
01:05:58,219 --> 01:05:59,680
Yeah.
- Don't listen to him, boss.

1469
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:00,985
It's a trick.

1470
01:06:00,985 --> 01:06:04,560
(cat meows)
(Wing Nut gasps)

1471
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:05,710
It's a trick.

1472
01:06:05,710 --> 01:06:08,053
He will humiliate you like all the others.

1473
01:06:10,021 --> 01:06:11,021
- You've got a gift.

1474
01:06:11,910 --> 01:06:13,923
- I was a loser.
- Look.

1475
01:06:14,979 --> 01:06:17,646
(Bernie laughs)

1476
01:06:18,649 --> 01:06:19,941
- [Wing Nut] Boss.

1477
01:06:19,941 --> 01:06:20,774
- Go.

1478
01:06:22,039 --> 01:06:22,872
Now!

1479
01:06:23,898 --> 01:06:26,315
(cat growls)

1480
01:06:32,093 --> 01:06:34,610
(clowns shouting)
(upbeat, quirky music)

1481
01:06:34,610 --> 01:06:36,567
(IQ grunts)

1482
01:06:36,567 --> 01:06:37,850
- Maybe it's the batteries.

1483
01:06:37,850 --> 01:06:40,723
Uh oh.

1484
01:06:41,850 --> 01:06:43,567
- Everyone laughed at me.

1485
01:06:43,567 --> 01:06:45,181
- No.

1486
01:06:45,181 --> 01:06:46,981
The children were laughing with you.

1487
01:06:47,979 --> 01:06:50,007
(Bernie laughs)

1488
01:06:50,007 --> 01:06:53,220
You should make a
generator that does that.

1489
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:55,070
People laughing with each other

1490
01:06:55,070 --> 01:06:57,760
instead of at each other. (laughs)

1491
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:01,023
You could save the world. (laughs)

1492
01:07:02,689 --> 01:07:07,689
(clowns shouting)
(tense, quirky music)

1493
01:07:08,972 --> 01:07:11,389
- [Clown 1] That little brat.

1494
01:07:15,959 --> 01:07:18,646
Is he under there?
- I don't see him.

1495
01:07:18,646 --> 01:07:23,646
(clowns shouting)
(quirky, tense music)

1496
01:07:32,781 --> 01:07:33,614
(whooshing)

1497
01:07:33,614 --> 01:07:38,614
(upbeat, funky music)
(clowns chattering)

1498
01:07:46,257 --> 01:07:49,257
(Wing Nut grunting)

1499
01:08:02,668 --> 01:08:04,370
- [Wing Nut] Yes, yes, yes.

1500
01:08:04,370 --> 01:08:05,413
Yes.

1501
01:08:05,413 --> 01:08:07,446
(machine beeping)

1502
01:08:07,446 --> 01:08:10,317
- [Machine] Warning, maximum
laughter overdrive engaged.

1503
01:08:10,317 --> 01:08:11,518
- Oh?

1504
01:08:11,518 --> 01:08:16,518
(beeping)
(upbeat, funky music)

1505
01:08:18,101 --> 01:08:20,599
- Oh! That thing's gonna blow!

1506
01:08:20,599 --> 01:08:21,432
Go!

1507
01:08:25,294 --> 01:08:27,627
- [Clown 1] Clownin' around!

1508
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:29,872
Oh no!

1509
01:08:32,184 --> 01:08:36,298
- [Clown 2] We've got to get out of here!

1510
01:08:36,298 --> 01:08:37,693
(buzzing)

1511
01:08:37,693 --> 01:08:38,527
- No!

1512
01:08:40,612 --> 01:08:45,612
(machine beeping)
(clowns shouting)

1513
01:08:49,779 --> 01:08:50,862
- Wait.
- Huh?

1514
01:08:51,922 --> 01:08:53,060
- [Clown 3] I thought it was done.

1515
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:55,509
(electric buzzing)
(booming)

1516
01:08:55,509 --> 01:08:57,759
(laughing)

1517
01:09:04,022 --> 01:09:06,031
- Shut it down.

1518
01:09:06,031 --> 01:09:07,698
- I can't, I can't..

1519
01:09:09,309 --> 01:09:11,232
- Shut it down.

1520
01:09:11,232 --> 01:09:13,482
(laughing)

1521
01:09:18,169 --> 01:09:19,031
I can't stop.
- I can't.

1522
01:09:19,031 --> 01:09:21,122
(laughing)
- Shut it down!

1523
01:09:21,122 --> 01:09:25,208
- I can't!
(laughing)

1524
01:09:25,208 --> 01:09:28,622
- Give it to me!

1525
01:09:28,622 --> 01:09:30,872
(laughing)

1526
01:09:32,903 --> 01:09:35,319
(squelching)

1527
01:09:42,453 --> 01:09:43,871
- [Wing Nut] Huh?

1528
01:09:45,130 --> 01:09:47,380
(laughing)

1529
01:09:51,795 --> 01:09:54,030
- [Russian President] I had
sense of humor for a moment.

1530
01:09:56,403 --> 01:09:59,485
(laughing)

1531
01:09:59,485 --> 01:10:01,735
(laughing)

1532
01:10:04,570 --> 01:10:09,570
(laughing)
(dramatic music)

1533
01:10:10,911 --> 01:10:12,327
- [Wing Nut] Huh?

1534
01:10:16,898 --> 01:10:19,223
(splashing)

1535
01:10:19,223 --> 01:10:21,473
(sparking)

1536
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:29,286
(Splat panting)

1537
01:10:29,286 --> 01:10:31,153
(Wing Nut grumbles)

1538
01:10:31,153 --> 01:10:32,059
- You did it, boy.

1539
01:10:32,059 --> 01:10:33,673
Good boy, good boy, you did it.

1540
01:10:33,673 --> 01:10:35,260
Good boy, you saved us all.

1541
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:36,093
Good boy.

1542
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:40,830
(buzzing)
(Splat farts)

1543
01:10:40,830 --> 01:10:42,416
- [World Leader 1] Nice to meet you.

1544
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:44,477
- [World Leader 2] Thank you.

1545
01:10:47,385 --> 01:10:50,385
- [World Leader 3] Other side, here.

1546
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:52,733
- Wow.

1547
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:56,593
I had no idea.

1548
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:03,413
- Imagine what could happen
if you used it for good.

1549
01:11:05,799 --> 01:11:06,639
- No.

1550
01:11:06,639 --> 01:11:07,473
- But-

1551
01:11:07,473 --> 01:11:10,980
- Juggleheads, take away these children

1552
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:13,080
and let's begin our repairs.

1553
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:16,380
It's never too late to end
human civilization as we know it

1554
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:17,856
and to begin domin-

1555
01:11:17,856 --> 01:11:19,389
- How does a farmer count cows?

1556
01:11:19,389 --> 01:11:20,309
- Wait, what?

1557
01:11:20,309 --> 01:11:22,023
- How does a farmer count cows?

1558
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:26,798
With a cow-culator.

1559
01:11:26,798 --> 01:11:29,170
(clowns laugh)

1560
01:11:29,170 --> 01:11:31,433
Or uh, how about this one,

1561
01:11:32,273 --> 01:11:33,874
what do ghosts have for dessert?

1562
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:38,882
I-scream!

1563
01:11:38,882 --> 01:11:41,132
(laughing)

1564
01:11:42,135 --> 01:11:43,277
And...

1565
01:11:43,277 --> 01:11:44,820
Oh, this is a great one.

1566
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:47,460
What do you sea monsters have for lunch?

1567
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:50,510
- I don't know, Bernie.
What do sea monsters eat?

1568
01:11:50,510 --> 01:11:52,483
- Fish and ships.

1569
01:11:52,483 --> 01:11:54,780
(laughing)

1570
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:57,850
- I-scream, I get it now. (laughs)

1571
01:11:57,850 --> 01:11:59,010
- See?

1572
01:11:59,010 --> 01:12:01,860
See how good people feel with
the right type of laughter?

1573
01:12:02,755 --> 01:12:06,490
With your genius and the right
kind of humor, you could...

1574
01:12:06,490 --> 01:12:07,840
- I could change the world.

1575
01:12:09,430 --> 01:12:10,263
- For the good.

1576
01:12:11,132 --> 01:12:13,799
(phone ringing)

1577
01:12:15,450 --> 01:12:17,527
- What?
- I ain't got one.

1578
01:12:17,527 --> 01:12:21,350
No, I got no phone.
(phone ringing)

1579
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:22,183
- Hello?

1580
01:12:23,925 --> 01:12:25,179
They've got the pace surrounded.

1581
01:12:25,179 --> 01:12:27,679
(clowns gasp)

1582
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:30,460
They want you to give yourself up.

1583
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:37,513
- It could be a new
beginning for all of us.

1584
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:40,610
- Don't listen to him. (laughs)

1585
01:12:40,610 --> 01:12:42,600
He's been tricked.
(cat growling)

1586
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:44,342
Follow me.

1587
01:12:44,342 --> 01:12:47,822
I will be your new leader. (laughs)

1588
01:12:47,822 --> 01:12:49,155
I will...
(cat growls)

1589
01:12:49,155 --> 01:12:50,040
Together, we will finish the revolution.

1590
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:55,040
Together, we will-
(cat screeches)

1591
01:12:55,973 --> 01:12:58,710
Ah, ah, get him off!
(clowns laughs)

1592
01:12:58,710 --> 01:13:00,880
- My fellow jokesters,

1593
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:05,650
a new day is dawning, a
day where we no longer

1594
01:13:05,650 --> 01:13:08,460
need to hide our true identity,

1595
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:11,790
a day where we can make
the world a better place

1596
01:13:11,790 --> 01:13:14,143
by being who we were created to be.

1597
01:13:17,541 --> 01:13:20,041
(clowns gasp)

1598
01:13:26,093 --> 01:13:29,093
- [Clown 5] Oh, god, that's my nose.

1599
01:13:30,433 --> 01:13:31,370
(sirens wailing)

1600
01:13:31,370 --> 01:13:34,603
- [Officer] All right,
come on, keep goin'.

1601
01:13:34,603 --> 01:13:37,003
(clowns chattering)
(police radio chatter)

1602
01:13:37,003 --> 01:13:39,681
Move it. Move it along.

1603
01:13:39,681 --> 01:13:42,210
- [Female Clown] See you later, Bernie.

1604
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:45,309
Be sure to write. (laughs)

1605
01:13:45,309 --> 01:13:47,418
- Well done, Agent Dingledorf.

1606
01:13:47,418 --> 01:13:48,500
- I told you I'm not an agent.

1607
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:51,809
- Exactly, which is why
you're such a great secret.

1608
01:13:51,809 --> 01:13:52,983
You and your team.

1609
01:13:54,670 --> 01:13:56,110
- Team?

1610
01:13:56,110 --> 01:13:56,943
- For you.

1611
01:13:58,889 --> 01:14:02,950
And for you, Lens Cap.
Pretending to be an artist.

1612
01:14:02,950 --> 01:14:04,531
- Pretending?

1613
01:14:04,531 --> 01:14:06,344
(Agent 001/2 chuckles)

1614
01:14:06,344 --> 01:14:08,719
- And you, Splat, are disguised as

1615
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:10,920
the poster dog for Overeater's Anonymous.

1616
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:14,130
Who's a good agent?
(Splat grunts)

1617
01:14:14,130 --> 01:14:16,740
And last but not least, for you, IQ,

1618
01:14:16,740 --> 01:14:18,643
the brains behind the whole operation.

1619
01:14:19,965 --> 01:14:20,990
- Cool clouds.

1620
01:14:20,990 --> 01:14:24,370
- All of you pretending to
be boring, everyday people.

1621
01:14:24,370 --> 01:14:25,650
- Which we are.

1622
01:14:25,650 --> 01:14:26,483
- Exactly.

1623
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:31,452
- [EMT] The victim has multiple
hats stretches to the face.

1624
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:33,782
Yes, the clown.

1625
01:14:34,990 --> 01:14:36,910
Seriously, the clown.

1626
01:14:36,910 --> 01:14:38,415
- Allergies.

1627
01:14:38,415 --> 01:14:41,079
(thudding)
(Wing Nut grunts)

1628
01:14:41,079 --> 01:14:43,329
(grunting)

1629
01:14:45,244 --> 01:14:46,244
- Hordikins!

1630
01:14:47,270 --> 01:14:48,103
(Splat farts)

1631
01:14:48,103 --> 01:14:50,023
My hero.
- My muffin.

1632
01:14:50,023 --> 01:14:51,821
(kissing)

1633
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:54,650
- I wanted to let you know
that one of those nice men

1634
01:14:54,650 --> 01:14:57,603
in those nice suits asked
me to give you this.

1635
01:15:05,678 --> 01:15:06,571
(Anna gasps)

1636
01:15:06,571 --> 01:15:07,967
Oh.

1637
01:15:07,967 --> 01:15:08,800
(gasps)

1638
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:11,697
- The president wants to give me a medal.

1639
01:15:11,697 --> 01:15:12,530
- A medal?

1640
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:15,269
- For?

1641
01:15:15,269 --> 01:15:17,593
- For planning this
whole operation, silly.

1642
01:15:18,450 --> 01:15:22,343
He's just the smartest
secret agent now, isn't he?

1643
01:15:23,357 --> 01:15:24,625
(Agent 001/2 chuckles)

1644
01:15:24,625 --> 01:15:26,607
- Well, duty calls.

1645
01:15:26,607 --> 01:15:28,469
(upbeat marching music)

1646
01:15:28,469 --> 01:15:29,780
Yep.
- Um, we're-

1647
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:31,750
- Nope.
- I, uh...

1648
01:15:31,750 --> 01:15:32,583
Yeah.

1649
01:15:34,118 --> 01:15:35,285
- [Paul] Bern.

1650
01:15:36,389 --> 01:15:37,222
- Dad!

1651
01:15:38,361 --> 01:15:40,861
(Splat barks)

1652
01:15:44,730 --> 01:15:46,820
- Hey, are you all right?
Is everything okay?

1653
01:15:46,820 --> 01:15:48,362
- Yeah. Yeah, you?

1654
01:15:49,313 --> 01:15:50,803
- I couldn't be better.

1655
01:15:51,678 --> 01:15:54,761
(police siren beeps)

1656
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,420
So guess what?

1657
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:01,920
The Secretary liked your idea.

1658
01:16:02,770 --> 01:16:03,610
- Idea?

1659
01:16:03,610 --> 01:16:05,040
- Yeah, about Chuckles using his gift

1660
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:06,630
to make the world a better place.

1661
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:09,952
And if he does so, he
might only get probation.

1662
01:16:11,430 --> 01:16:12,389
Boom.

1663
01:16:12,389 --> 01:16:13,500
Let's go see the kids.

1664
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:14,564
Hey, come on, Splat.

1665
01:16:14,564 --> 01:16:15,397
Let's go.
(Splat barks)

1666
01:16:15,397 --> 01:16:17,719
- The world can rest assured
that I have saved the day

1667
01:16:17,719 --> 01:16:21,160
and as usual the agency that I work for

1668
01:16:22,374 --> 01:16:25,916
does not respect my abilities
and I should be promoted

1669
01:16:25,916 --> 01:16:29,499
but they won't do it
because of politics...

1670
01:16:30,365 --> 01:16:33,448
(soft, upbeat music)

1671
01:16:35,853 --> 01:16:38,603
(birds chirping)

1672
01:16:41,764 --> 01:16:42,598
- Come on.

1673
01:16:46,121 --> 01:16:47,371
Stupid English.

1674
01:16:48,907 --> 01:16:52,074
(tense, quirky music)

1675
01:16:54,367 --> 01:16:55,464
- Pick it up.

1676
01:16:55,464 --> 01:16:57,128
I'll break you.

1677
01:16:57,128 --> 01:16:58,214
Boom, boom, boom.

1678
01:16:58,214 --> 01:16:59,050
You talkin' to me?

1679
01:16:59,050 --> 01:17:00,100
See these right here?

1680
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:03,157
You talkin' to me?

1681
01:17:04,474 --> 01:17:07,224
(Russell grunts)

1682
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:16,280
- What are you doing here?

1683
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:19,293
- Uh, I uh, I always take the shortcut.

1684
01:17:20,870 --> 01:17:22,510
What are you doing?

1685
01:17:22,510 --> 01:17:25,823
- Working on a stupid
paper for stupid English.

1686
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:31,020
Doesn't sound so bad.

1687
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:32,420
- Well not for you.

1688
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:33,393
You're smart.

1689
01:17:41,311 --> 01:17:43,619
(Russell grunts)

1690
01:17:43,619 --> 01:17:45,809
(sighs)

1691
01:17:45,809 --> 01:17:48,893
I get another F, my dad's gonna kill me.

1692
01:17:50,616 --> 01:17:51,623
I'm such a loser.

1693
01:17:55,011 --> 01:17:58,844
- Well, maybe I could,
you know, help you out.

1694
01:18:01,864 --> 01:18:03,221
- What?

1695
01:18:03,221 --> 01:18:06,243
- Well like you said, this
stuff comes easy for me.

1696
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:07,993
What's it on?

1697
01:18:09,330 --> 01:18:10,782
- Um, heroes.

1698
01:18:12,450 --> 01:18:13,570
- Heroes?
- Yeah.

1699
01:18:13,570 --> 01:18:16,263
Like those guys that saved the
World Peace Conference thing.

1700
01:18:18,507 --> 01:18:22,980
- Uh, yeah. I could
give you some pointers.

1701
01:18:27,702 --> 01:18:30,059
- You know, it doesn't
have to be hot shots.

1702
01:18:30,059 --> 01:18:34,043
It can be a normal, everyday people, too.

1703
01:18:35,139 --> 01:18:36,450
- Right.

1704
01:18:36,450 --> 01:18:37,770
- Yeah.

1705
01:18:37,770 --> 01:18:40,580
- Even um, know-nothing twerps that help

1706
01:18:40,580 --> 01:18:42,943
other guys out with schoolwork and stuff.

1707
01:18:45,910 --> 01:18:46,743
- Thanks.

1708
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:49,670
- But never mention it.

1709
01:18:49,670 --> 01:18:51,134
- Right.
- To no one.

1710
01:18:51,134 --> 01:18:51,967
- Okay.

1711
01:18:53,496 --> 01:18:54,934
- Ever.

1712
01:18:54,934 --> 01:18:55,768
- Got it.

1713
01:18:57,224 --> 01:18:59,641
(soft music)

1714
01:19:10,242 --> 01:19:12,575
(whistling)

1715
01:19:14,799 --> 01:19:15,952
(bag thuds)

1716
01:19:15,952 --> 01:19:17,270
(quirky, mysterious music)

1717
01:19:17,270 --> 01:19:18,250
- No.

1718
01:19:18,250 --> 01:19:20,673
Nope. I'm not doing it anymore.

1719
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:22,737
I'm done.

1720
01:19:22,737 --> 01:19:24,540
(phone ringing)

1721
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:26,028
(Bernie sighs)

1722
01:19:26,028 --> 01:19:28,695
(phone ringing)

1723
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:37,901
Hello?

1724
01:19:37,901 --> 01:19:40,110
(distorted chattering)

1725
01:19:40,110 --> 01:19:41,500
Oh.

1726
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:42,333
Hello?

1727
01:19:42,333 --> 01:19:44,320
- [Agent 001/2] Agent Dingledorf, hurry.

1728
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:45,303
Get in the car.

1729
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:48,268
- What car? I don't see a car.

1730
01:19:48,268 --> 01:19:49,942
- [Agent 001/2] Oh. (laughs)

1731
01:19:49,942 --> 01:19:50,775
Sorry.

1732
01:19:51,830 --> 01:19:53,246
Hang on, hang on.

1733
01:19:54,210 --> 01:19:55,043
Whoa.

1734
01:19:56,540 --> 01:19:58,411
Get back, back, back, back, back, back.

1735
01:19:58,411 --> 01:19:59,295
Get back.

1736
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:01,192
And forward.
(tires squeal)

1737
01:20:01,192 --> 01:20:02,500
Okay, here we go.

1738
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:03,333
And, nope.

1739
01:20:04,352 --> 01:20:06,300
(Agent 001/2 grunts)

1740
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:07,820
There we go.

1741
01:20:07,820 --> 01:20:08,760
No.

1742
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:10,135
Yeah. There we go.

1743
01:20:10,135 --> 01:20:11,943
Hold on, hold on.

1744
01:20:12,921 --> 01:20:13,921
Just, and...

1745
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:15,713
Okay, stand still.

1746
01:20:15,713 --> 01:20:18,420
No, no me. You stand...

1747
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:19,992
Okay.

1748
01:20:19,992 --> 01:20:21,889
(Agent 001/2 mumbling)

1749
01:20:21,889 --> 01:20:22,723
There we go.

1750
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:26,279
Hurry Agent Dingledorf.

1751
01:20:26,279 --> 01:20:28,003
- Shh!
- Oh, sorry.

1752
01:20:28,003 --> 01:20:28,835
Hurry.

1753
01:20:30,415 --> 01:20:33,998
(upbeat, mysterious music)

1754
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:38,830
- Who's driving?

1755
01:20:38,830 --> 01:20:39,889
- [Agent 001/2] Not me.

1756
01:20:39,889 --> 01:20:41,650
- Agent 001/2, is that you?

1757
01:20:41,650 --> 01:20:43,930
- [Agent 001/2] Yes, it isn't me.

1758
01:20:43,930 --> 01:20:45,910
- You mean no it isn't you?

1759
01:20:45,910 --> 01:20:49,340
- I mean, yes, it's no that it's not yes.

1760
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:50,550
- Who am I talking to?

1761
01:20:50,550 --> 01:20:51,410
- [Agent 001/2] Nobody.

1762
01:20:51,410 --> 01:20:54,550
- So I'm talking to
nobody who isn't driving?

1763
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:55,840
- [Agent 001/2] You're getting very good

1764
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,719
at this secret agent thing.

1765
01:20:57,719 --> 01:20:58,666
- Says who?

1766
01:20:58,666 --> 01:21:00,510
- [Agent 001/2] Not me.

1767
01:21:00,510 --> 01:21:03,782
Agent Dingledorf, your
country desperately needs you.

1768
01:21:05,571 --> 01:21:08,210
- I have school, a spelling test.

1769
01:21:08,210 --> 01:21:09,043
- [Agent 001/2] If we don't hurry,

1770
01:21:09,043 --> 01:21:10,993
there'll be no words left to spell.

1771
01:21:13,008 --> 01:21:14,333
Well?

1772
01:21:14,333 --> 01:21:15,969
- All right.

1773
01:21:15,969 --> 01:21:17,851
But seriously, this has
to be the very last-

1774
01:21:17,851 --> 01:21:21,191
(tires skid)
Time!

1775
01:21:21,191 --> 01:21:24,245
Wherever evil lurks, wherever it may hide,

1776
01:21:24,245 --> 01:21:28,559
it is time to unmask it and
reveal truth to the world.

1777
01:21:28,559 --> 01:21:31,180
It's time to right the world's wrongs

1778
01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:33,820
and fight injustice wherever it may lie.

1779
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:36,230
To help the downtrodden and depressed,

1780
01:21:36,230 --> 01:21:39,620
using all our abilities to
make the world a better place.

1781
01:21:39,620 --> 01:21:42,632
Of honor and respect for all.

1782
01:21:42,632 --> 01:21:43,976
- Cut, cut!

1783
01:21:43,976 --> 01:21:45,393
Cut!

1784
01:21:45,393 --> 01:21:47,630
(upbeat, funky music)

1785
01:21:47,630 --> 01:21:52,630
(people clapping)
(cheering)

1786
01:21:56,132 --> 01:21:58,088
- Let's dance.

1787
01:21:58,088 --> 01:22:00,014
(upbeat, funky music)

1788
01:22:00,014 --> 01:22:02,371
Come on, everybody. Let's celebrate.

1789
01:22:02,371 --> 01:22:05,538
(upbeat, funky music)

1790
01:22:08,730 --> 01:22:10,180
- [Bernie] Nice. Let's do it.

1791
01:22:12,380 --> 01:22:15,105
♪ My milkshake boys are
coming to the yard ♪

1792
01:22:15,105 --> 01:22:20,105
(clapping)
(cheering)

1793
01:22:20,165 --> 01:22:21,809
(sighs)
(laughing)

1794
01:22:21,809 --> 01:22:23,610
- Stop being funny, this is serious.

1795
01:22:24,462 --> 01:22:25,295
Ah!

1796
01:22:26,832 --> 01:22:27,665
Ah!

1797
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:29,820
- My hiccups are gone.

1798
01:22:31,853 --> 01:22:33,103
- Brace for it.

1799
01:22:34,883 --> 01:22:36,412
(laughing)

1800
01:22:36,412 --> 01:22:37,802
- That was the thing.

1801
01:22:37,802 --> 01:22:38,802
Didn't work.

1802
01:22:39,672 --> 01:22:40,505
- [Director] Cut.

1803
01:22:40,505 --> 01:22:41,773
- [Man] Lead camera only, marker.

1804
01:22:46,389 --> 01:22:47,680
- I feel accomplished.

1805
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:49,420
All right, let's try and get this perfect.

1806
01:22:49,420 --> 01:22:51,047
- We're making this super cool movie

1807
01:22:51,047 --> 01:22:53,990
and Bernie plays a Bonzo
superhero and we're...

1808
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:56,866
Sorry, can I go from the top.

1809
01:22:56,866 --> 01:22:57,853
I don't know what I did there.

1810
01:22:57,853 --> 01:22:59,127
- [Man] Adam, if you
could just do the shot.

1811
01:22:59,127 --> 01:23:00,590
(sneezes)

1812
01:23:00,590 --> 01:23:01,423
- Hurry!

1813
01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:03,443
(thuds)

1814
01:23:03,443 --> 01:23:05,596
(laughs)

1815
01:23:05,596 --> 01:23:08,763
(upbeat, funky music)

1816
01:23:12,330 --> 01:23:14,900
- It's possible the bar you ate

1817
01:23:14,900 --> 01:23:18,563
was especially crafted to
get the dialogue wrong.

1818
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,493
- It's a bunch of those Google guns.

1819
01:23:23,530 --> 01:23:24,362
Sorry.

1820
01:23:26,157 --> 01:23:27,740
Did I say Google guns?

1821
01:23:27,740 --> 01:23:30,213
- Just remember I'm the
actor and you follow me.

1822
01:23:31,525 --> 01:23:33,530
- I follow no one.
- You follow no one.

1823
01:23:33,530 --> 01:23:35,080
Actually, that's a good answer.

1824
01:23:35,940 --> 01:23:39,219
- It's bunch of those Google
guns wired and parallel.

1825
01:23:39,219 --> 01:23:41,190
- Making one super...

1826
01:23:41,190 --> 01:23:43,540
Making one giant, supercharged one.

1827
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:44,974
Yeah.

1828
01:23:44,974 --> 01:23:46,522
(chuckles)
You said Google gun again.

1829
01:23:46,522 --> 01:23:48,130
- I did?

1830
01:23:48,130 --> 01:23:49,800
- Sensors are indicating that Dr. Chuckles

1831
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:50,830
is preparing to destroy the gener-

1832
01:23:50,830 --> 01:23:52,223
Not destroy it, to fire it.

1833
01:23:53,611 --> 01:23:55,710
I feel like we've done
this dialogue before.

1834
01:23:55,710 --> 01:23:57,621
- Yeah. Deja vu.

1835
01:23:57,621 --> 01:24:00,920
(upbeat, funky music)

1836
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:02,370
- It's a bunch of those Goog-

1837
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,123
Now I think about it.

1838
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:08,469
- A clown who plans to destroy

1839
01:24:08,469 --> 01:24:10,730
the World Peace Conference using this

1840
01:24:10,730 --> 01:24:15,590
diabolical military
dialogue written for me

1841
01:24:15,590 --> 01:24:17,139
which I don't remember!

1842
01:24:17,139 --> 01:24:19,045
- [IQ] Hey, mister.

1843
01:24:19,045 --> 01:24:22,145
Mister.

1844
01:24:22,145 --> 01:24:25,228
(soft, upbeat music)

1845
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:27,214
- [Director] Cut.

1846
01:24:27,214 --> 01:24:28,912
- Yeah, you're-
- Oh.

1847
01:24:28,912 --> 01:24:29,919
- Hey mister!

1848
01:24:29,919 --> 01:24:32,626
Mister! You dropped your...

1849
01:24:32,626 --> 01:24:34,940
(upbeat, funky music)

1850
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:36,889
- To reach every cell phone in the world

1851
01:24:36,889 --> 01:24:39,103
so each and every citizen-

1852
01:24:39,103 --> 01:24:39,960
(farting)

1853
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:40,793
Farts!

1854
01:24:42,707 --> 01:24:43,540
You wanna go back a little bit?

1855
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:44,498
- [Man] Yeah, that was good.

1856
01:24:44,498 --> 01:24:45,760
(laughing)

1857
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:50,666
Let's go back to the, uh, top.

1858
01:24:50,666 --> 01:24:53,380
- The secret warehouse
and weapons headquarters

1859
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:54,213
of the notorious-

1860
01:24:54,213 --> 01:24:55,400
Sorry. One more time.

1861
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:57,360
The secret warehouse and weapons...

1862
01:24:58,520 --> 01:24:59,603
Headquarters.

1863
01:24:59,603 --> 01:25:00,436
I don't know why I can't remember that.

1864
01:25:00,436 --> 01:25:01,269
Okay.

1865
01:25:01,269 --> 01:25:03,112
- Sorry, can I start over again?

1866
01:25:03,112 --> 01:25:04,480
Ah, sorry.

1867
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:06,110
Yeah, sorry about that.

1868
01:25:06,110 --> 01:25:08,219
Sebastian Horkelsnorken.

1869
01:25:08,219 --> 01:25:09,170
Can we go again?

1870
01:25:09,170 --> 01:25:11,110
Hey, is your nose okay?
- You like punched it.

1871
01:25:11,110 --> 01:25:11,950
- I'm sorry.

1872
01:25:11,950 --> 01:25:13,300
I'll grab it from the side.

1873
01:25:15,413 --> 01:25:17,663
(laughing)

1874
01:25:19,916 --> 01:25:21,014
- [IQ] I slipped.

1875
01:25:21,014 --> 01:25:22,367
- Are you okay?

1876
01:25:22,367 --> 01:25:24,534
(yelling)

1877
01:25:27,583 --> 01:25:28,744
(yelling)

1878
01:25:28,744 --> 01:25:31,498
(hits)
- Oh gosh.

1879
01:25:31,498 --> 01:25:32,331
Sorry.

1880
01:25:32,331 --> 01:25:33,880
I accidentally, I tapped him...

1881
01:25:35,423 --> 01:25:36,980
(cheering)
(clapping)

1882
01:25:36,980 --> 01:25:38,355
- [Man] Z marker.

1883
01:25:38,355 --> 01:25:42,350
- Um, I think it's his uh,
initials, so it's weird.

1884
01:25:42,350 --> 01:25:43,600
- Wait, what?

1885
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:44,460
- See?

1886
01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:46,010
- Ber-
- I'm dumb.

1887
01:25:46,010 --> 01:25:47,446
- Nie.
- Yeah.

1888
01:25:47,446 --> 01:25:49,893
(laughing)

1889
01:25:49,893 --> 01:25:52,143
(laughing)

1890
01:25:54,380 --> 01:25:55,950
- This is the best your
career will ever be

1891
01:25:55,950 --> 01:25:57,298
right here in this moment.

1892
01:25:57,298 --> 01:25:58,700
Look at me.

1893
01:25:58,700 --> 01:26:00,144
You're probably gonna be the
biggest star in the world

1894
01:26:00,144 --> 01:26:01,620
and you're gonna remind me I said that.

1895
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:02,737
- Yeah, I will.
- Oh, I already hate you.

1896
01:26:02,737 --> 01:26:04,860
- I'm gonna go back, I'm
gonna find your address

1897
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:07,357
and I'm gonna say remember
when you said this?

1898
01:26:07,357 --> 01:26:08,190
- Remember when-

1899
01:26:08,190 --> 01:26:09,600
Find my address?

1900
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:12,137
That's already the creepiest
thing you've said today.

1901
01:26:12,137 --> 01:26:12,992
(laughs)

1902
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:16,141
- A solar powered snot flicker.

1903
01:26:16,141 --> 01:26:17,493
That's funny.

1904
01:26:17,493 --> 01:26:19,910
A solar powered snot flicker.

1905
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:22,652
That's weird.

1906
01:26:22,652 --> 01:26:24,450
(clapping)

1907
01:26:24,450 --> 01:26:25,370
Ooh.

1908
01:26:25,370 --> 01:26:26,903
X-ray glasses.

1909
01:26:29,397 --> 01:26:30,250
Can we do it again?

1910
01:26:30,250 --> 01:26:32,030
Rocket powered shoe laces.

1911
01:26:32,030 --> 01:26:32,889
Ooh.

1912
01:26:32,889 --> 01:26:34,093
X-ray glasses.

1913
01:26:38,205 --> 01:26:40,010
(laughing)

1914
01:26:40,010 --> 01:26:41,880
Why are they, like, so weird?

1915
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:43,697
They're, oh, I felt the wrong one.

1916
01:26:44,897 --> 01:26:49,730
(clapping)
(upbeat music)

1917
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:53,380
Really? Another mission?

1918
01:26:53,380 --> 01:26:54,887
Cool.

1919
01:26:54,887 --> 01:26:59,260
(clapping)
(upbeat music)

1920
01:26:59,260 --> 01:27:02,671
- Yeah, dingleberry, I'm in the right...

1921
01:27:02,671 --> 01:27:04,921
(laughing)

1922
01:27:07,350 --> 01:27:08,924
- Sorry about that.

1923
01:27:08,924 --> 01:27:11,261
- [Man] We're rolling. Still rolling.

1924
01:27:11,261 --> 01:27:12,735
- Still rolling!

1925
01:27:12,735 --> 01:27:17,568
(clapping)
(upbeat music)

1926
01:27:24,656 --> 01:27:27,508
(laughs)

1927
01:27:27,508 --> 01:27:28,791
- [Director] You okay?

1928
01:27:28,791 --> 01:27:31,340
Got something in your eye?
- Nope.

1929
01:27:31,340 --> 01:27:32,173
Just bad acting.

1930
01:27:33,266 --> 01:27:36,106
(laughing)

1931
01:27:36,106 --> 01:27:39,866
(soft, upbeat music)

1932
01:27:39,866 --> 01:27:42,116
(laughing)

1933
01:27:44,019 --> 01:27:45,980
- Muffin.
- My hero.

1934
01:27:45,980 --> 01:27:48,019
- I stepped on your line.
- Yeah.

1935
01:27:48,019 --> 01:27:50,269
(laughing)

1936
01:27:54,356 --> 01:27:55,189
- Oh.

1937
01:27:57,410 --> 01:27:59,708
- [Director] My hero, rolling.

1938
01:27:59,708 --> 01:28:01,233
- I was just, I was ripping.

1939
01:28:02,491 --> 01:28:06,991
(cheering)
(clapping)

1940
01:28:10,343 --> 01:28:14,503
- He's just the smartest
secret agent now, isn't he?

1941
01:28:18,062 --> 01:28:18,895
Oh.

1942
01:28:20,114 --> 01:28:23,197
(soft, upbeat music)

1943
01:28:25,853 --> 01:28:28,380
(laughing)

1944
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:29,260
- Where are we going from?

1945
01:28:29,260 --> 01:28:30,485
Are we good to keep going?

1946
01:28:30,485 --> 01:28:31,318
- Cut!

1947
01:28:31,318 --> 01:28:32,151
Cut!

1948
01:28:32,151 --> 01:28:32,984
Cut!

1949
01:28:32,984 --> 01:28:36,088
Cut, cut, cut!
(cheering)

1950
01:28:36,088 --> 01:28:38,480
- It's a wrap!
(clapping)

1951
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:39,700
- They'll be showing this movie

1952
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:42,153
in film schools, you know that, right?
