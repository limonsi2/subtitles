3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,039
Once there was the

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,373
most beautiful place, EggTown.

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,149
A place where rabbits and chickens

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,243
lived together in perfect harmony.

7
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,533
Aah, but all was not perfect.

8
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,839
Beyond the lovely meadows in Meroly Brooke

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,056
were swamps and badlands,

10
00:00:26,057 --> 00:00:29,153
where creatures lurked
and watched and waited.

11
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:32,903
And when everyone in EggTown was sleeping,

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,604
one little fellow in
particular tried his very best

13
00:00:36,605 --> 00:00:39,599
to watch over his friends,

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,653
his name was Good Gracious Grasshopper.

15
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,163
- Good gracious.

16
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,463
Why can't I find a
butterscotch jelly bean.

17
00:00:54,464 --> 00:00:55,297
Gracious.

18
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:02,559
Who could that be?

19
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,663
Sneaking about in the middle
of the night, good gracious.

20
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:23,366
Oh, that's Tiny Tessie's house.

21
00:01:23,367 --> 00:01:25,003
Oh no, good gracious.

22
00:01:47,891 --> 00:01:50,391
Aah, wake up Tessie, look out.

23
00:02:34,534 --> 00:02:35,622
Good gracious, good gracious.

24
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:37,890
I must warn Boss Bunny Baker.

25
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,469
Boss Bunny Baker, Boss Bunny Baker!

26
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,279
Good gracious, good
gracious, wake up please!

27
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,793
Good gracious, get up,
you're being robbed.

28
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,449
- Good Gracious Grasshopper,
what are you doing here?

29
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:32,539
- Oh, good gracious, Mrs.
Baker, you're being robbed.

30
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,049
There's someone in your shop.

31
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,549
- We're being robbed?

32
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:38,005
Oh dear, wake up Bossy, quick, quick.

33
00:03:41,814 --> 00:03:45,099
- Oh, he won't wake up, good
gracious, good gracious.

34
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,529
- I know how to wake him.

35
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,833
Bossy, oh Bossy, wake up!

36
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,529
- What? What's that?

37
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,799
- Good gracious, good gracious,

38
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,799
someone's robbing the bake shop.

39
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,200
- I'll call Sergeant O'Hare.

40
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,489
- I don't need Sergeant O'Hare,

41
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,379
no one robs my shop.
- Bossy come back.

42
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,079
Let Sergeant O'Hare handle it.

43
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,259
Oh, please be careful.

44
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,213
Good gracious.

45
00:04:11,277 --> 00:04:12,109
Be careful.
- You're dead.

46
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,669
Who do you think you are?

47
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,820
- Yeah, who do you think you are?

48
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:16,858
Good gracious.

49
00:04:19,341 --> 00:04:20,708
- Now, you're in for it.

50
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:22,662
- Yeah, now you're in for it.

51
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:23,836
Good gracious, good gracious.

52
00:04:23,837 --> 00:04:25,999
You're in trouble now,
sergeant O'Hare is on his way.

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,804
This is outrageous, good
gracious, good gracious.

54
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,606
Good gracious!

55
00:04:36,723 --> 00:04:38,840
Oh, no!

56
00:04:44,955 --> 00:04:45,855
Oh, good gracious.

57
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:50,270
- Now I got you, you
miserable thieving thief

58
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,090
- I'm sorry mama.

59
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,330
- Hey losers, look whose back with dinner.

60
00:06:24,331 --> 00:06:25,331
- All right.

61
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,529
- What took you so long Timothy?

62
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:32,669
We're starving here and
that Slack Cookie food

63
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,493
tastes like garbage.

64
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:40,569
- Here Steel, would you
like some chicken wings?

65
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,943
- Oh yeah, thanks Cookie.

66
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:47,903
- Anyone else care for some wings?

67
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,959
Now let's see how many
presents Timothy brought us

68
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,929
from those sweet little
bunnies and chicks.

69
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:01,149
Did you bring me any cute chicks?

70
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:06,150
- Yeah, all the chicks want
you, fried, extra crispy.

71
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,599
- Cough it up Timothy,

72
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,617
lets see what you got from
those EggTown Easter freaks.

73
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,553
You call this a haul?

74
00:07:20,145 --> 00:07:21,801
A little crumby if you ask me.

75
00:07:21,802 --> 00:07:26,052
We give you one simple job
and you'll follow it up.

76
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:36,719
- I'd have my pockets full

77
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,329
if it wasn't for that
sneaky little grasshopper.

78
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,279
He must've followed me.

79
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,798
- He what?

80
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:46,519
He followed you back here?

81
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,069
You let yourself be tailed?

82
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:49,983
You idiot.

83
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:56,399
- He didn't follow me here,
he followed me into town,

84
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,259
to the bakers but I gave them the slip

85
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,469
when I ducked into the woods.

86
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:04,149
- He's lying, he's got
fluff cream all over him.

87
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,759
I bet he ate most of the haul.

88
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,229
- Yeah, egg day is almost here.

89
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:11,069
There had to be more cupcakes and pies.

90
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:14,139
He's hiding it in the forest for himself.

91
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,103
Let's croak him.

92
00:08:16,153 --> 00:08:17,319
- No, first we make him tell us

93
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,789
where he stashed the
goodies then we croak him.

94
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,949
- I say, if he's keeping our share,

95
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,809
we croak him and eat him.

96
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:29,699
- I could turn him into a
nice meat pie or a casserole.

97
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,713
- Just try it you vultures.

98
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,689
Shut up, I can't think with
all you dumb cluck shouting.

99
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,840
I swear you don't have
a brain between you.

100
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:46,333
Okay Steel, get the map, I have an idea.

101
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,319
Those little hair balls are gonna pay.

102
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,765
We're going to make them pay.

103
00:08:55,415 --> 00:08:58,149
Make them pay.

104
00:09:09,638 --> 00:09:14,638
- I can't believe I slept
all night in my chair.

105
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:18,173
I don't even remember sitting down.

106
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:27,005
Wake up Tilly, we can't
sleep the day away.

107
00:09:27,006 --> 00:09:32,006
It's Monday morning and
tomorrow is Egg day.

108
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,909
I'm going to go to try to do my shopping.

109
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,059
I won't be gone too long

110
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,503
and I'll bring you back a nice surprise.

111
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:52,513
Can't go out without my pink chicken lips.

112
00:09:55,518 --> 00:10:00,518
A little feathers spray and
I'm ready to face the day.

113
00:10:03,966 --> 00:10:04,799
Bye Tilly.

114
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:12,610
What a beautiful day, a
perfectly lovely day to shop.

115
00:10:17,712 --> 00:10:21,095
- Hey guys wait up, wait up you guys.

116
00:10:22,897 --> 00:10:25,669
- Oh, I wish I could run that fast,

117
00:10:36,171 --> 00:10:40,289
Oh, these flowers are beautiful Flora,

118
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,067
almost as pretty as you.

119
00:10:43,314 --> 00:10:45,269
- Ms. Tessie, it's so nice to see you.

120
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,059
I'm glad you like them.

121
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:50,229
I saved a lovely basket of
violets out back for you.

122
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:54,283
- Oh Flora, violets are my favorite.

123
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,133
- I know that Ms. Tessie,
I knew you'd love them.

124
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:04,382
- That's perfect, what do I owe you?

125
00:11:04,383 --> 00:11:06,379
- You don't have to
pay me now, Ms. Tessie.

126
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,315
Would you like me to send you a bill?

127
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,099
- I would love you to
send me a Bill or a Bob

128
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,456
or a Charlie and could you
make sure he's handsome.

129
00:11:21,183 --> 00:11:22,804
Oh my.

130
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:34,459
Fresh plum cakes, they look luscious.

131
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,373
They were always Timothy's favorites.

132
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,059
- You there with the shawl,

133
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,999
you broke into my shop
last night and robbed me.

134
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,240
I'm calling the police

135
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,724
Would you run and get
sergeant O'Hare for me

136
00:11:59,725 --> 00:12:01,659
and tell him I've captured the thief.

137
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,260
- Tiny Tessie robbed the bakery.

138
00:12:04,604 --> 00:12:06,843
- Boss Baker just said so.

139
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,093
- Look, look at this, here's the evidence.

140
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,439
What's going on here, Boss?

141
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,380
- This is the thief who
robbed me last night.

142
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,079
The dried fluff cream from the pie I threw

143
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,483
is still all over her shawl.

144
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,423
- Ms. Tessie, is this your shawl?

145
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,139
- She admitted it, she nodded yes.

146
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,943
- See, she admits its her
shawl, she nodded yes.

147
00:12:38,663 --> 00:12:41,709
- Ms. Tessie, why won't you speak?

148
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:44,839
- She's too embarrassed
to speak, she should be.

149
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,629
- Is that why you're nodding
yes and not speaking?

150
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:52,913
Ms. Tessie, are you ashamed
you robbed the shop last night?

151
00:12:54,661 --> 00:12:57,889
- She admits it, she
confessed to the whole thing.

152
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,769
The fluff bream
is all over her shawl,

153
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:00,603
that's proof.

154
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:07,609
- I'm afraid I have no choice
but to arrest you, Ms. Tessie.

155
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,283
You'll have to come with me.

156
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,319
Back up everyone, back to work now.

157
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,053
Let's go folks, move it along.

158
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,539
If you won't come along on
your own accord Ms. Tessie,

159
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:26,439
we'll just have to carry you off to jail.

160
00:13:30,952 --> 00:13:31,785
- Help me!

161
00:13:34,888 --> 00:13:35,721
Help me!

162
00:13:38,246 --> 00:13:39,079
Help!

163
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,869
- You will notice class
that the only way to weaken

164
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,349
the dangerous wolf vine violet

165
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,879
is to pluck out all the flowers.

166
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,279
That's it, no more
talking, no more laughing,

167
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,579
no more misbehaving, nothing.

168
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,709
Or you'll all be back here tomorrow,

169
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,989
I don't care if it is a holiday.

170
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:08,139
Who wants to be responsible
for ruining Egg Day?

171
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,693
Go ahead, speak up.

172
00:14:12,433 --> 00:14:14,929
Now, I want it absolutely quiet in here

173
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:18,063
until the bell rings, no more nonsense.

174
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:20,789
Good afternoon
teachers and students,

175
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:24,063
this is your headmaster,
Benedict Bunny speaking.

176
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:29,250
School will be closed
tomorrow for Egg Day.

177
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,379
- Now, form a single line.

178
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:38,023
No talking in line, no pushing.

179
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,779
Stop laughing, no humming.

180
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,300
We can stand here all day you know.

181
00:14:56,101 --> 00:14:57,117
I wish.

182
00:15:19,492 --> 00:15:23,489
- That terrible Harriet, I
hope I don't get her next year.

183
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:24,579
- I had her last year.

184
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:27,499
- She's so mean, she hates everyone.

185
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,559
- She doesn't hate big
boring Benedict Bunny.

186
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,003
- Be quite she'll hear you.

187
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,012
- Hi.

188
00:15:36,013 --> 00:15:39,133
- High is the opposite of low
young man, good afternoon.

189
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,599
- Tiny Tessie robbed the
bake shop last night.

190
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,579
- She totally destroyed the bake shop.

191
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,789
- The bakers were up all
night cleaning the place.

192
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:54,179
- I can't believe anyone
could be so stupid.

193
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,659
That's the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard.

194
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,789
Ms. Tessie could never...

195
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,453
- She's already in jail.

196
00:16:00,412 --> 00:16:01,556
It was a tail plucking.

197
00:16:01,557 --> 00:16:05,229
- Excuse me, but have
you all lost your minds?

198
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,929
Do you really believe Ms. Tessie

199
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:09,219
robbed Boss Baker shop last night?

200
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:12,999
- Yes we believe it,
Boss Baker saw her do it.

201
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,089
- He recognized her shawl,

202
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:17,739
there was fluff cream all over it.

203
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,572
- That proves it.

204
00:16:18,573 --> 00:16:21,389
- That only proves that Boss
Baker isn't any smarter now

205
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,690
than he was when I had
him in the sixth grade.

206
00:16:27,212 --> 00:16:31,169
- Hi, I mean, good afternoon, Ms. Harriet.

207
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,409
- It is not a good afternoon, Mr. Baker.

208
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,009
I understand you have told half
the town and Sergeant O'Hare

209
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:38,865
that Ms. Tessie robbed
your store last night?

210
00:16:38,866 --> 00:16:39,719
- She did.

211
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,639
- She did not and she
would not, Mr. Baker,

212
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,799
because, well first, she just would not

213
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,109
and second, she could not, Mr. Baker,

214
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:52,239
because Ms. Tessie does
not venture out at night

215
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,079
because she cannot see well at night

216
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,549
and because she is scared
half to death of Take-Its.

217
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,979
Remember Take-Its Mr. Baker?

218
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:03,099
Those lazy and thieving old
birds that live in the swamp.

219
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,479
They don't work, they
take whatever they need.

220
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,523
Think about it, Mr. Baker.

221
00:17:09,794 --> 00:17:11,947
- I saw her shawl, she was...

222
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:13,916
It was her shawl.

223
00:17:13,917 --> 00:17:16,893
- Could her shawl have been
worn by someone else, Mr. Baker?

224
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,309
- We asked her if she robbed the shop

225
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:23,809
and she shook her head yes like this.

226
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,579
- Mr. Baker, when poor,
Tiny Tessie gets scared

227
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,489
in the least, she forgets how to speak

228
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,479
and her head bobs up and down.

229
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,819
It is called shaking, Mr. Baker,

230
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,999
shaking from being so
frightened of Take-Its

231
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,009
and other idiots who accuse her of crimes

232
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,829
she could not possibly commit.

233
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:42,379
Do you think Tiny Tessie can
run faster than you, Mr. Baker?

234
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,449
Do you think Tiny Tessie could throw a pie

235
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,819
hard enough to knock you over, Mr. Baker?

236
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,509
Do you think Tiny Tessie could knock over

237
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,146
a great big pastry cabinet, Mr. Baker?

238
00:17:50,147 --> 00:17:52,689
Do you think you should
run over to the jail house

239
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:54,208
immediately and tell Sergeant O'Hare

240
00:17:54,209 --> 00:17:57,127
you made a mistake, Mr. Baker?

241
00:17:57,128 --> 00:18:00,383
No more nodding Mr. Baker,
just be on your way.

242
00:18:11,021 --> 00:18:13,597
- Get him, get him back.

243
00:18:15,675 --> 00:18:19,712
- No, stay away from my ferret,
she doesn't bother anyone

244
00:18:19,713 --> 00:18:22,160
and stop trampling through my flower beds.

245
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:31,669
- Hello Miss Harriet, I
just wanted to make sure

246
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:34,799
you were still planning to
picnic with me tomorrow.

247
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,783
- I always look forward to
our little once a year outing.

248
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,413
- As do I Ms. Harriet.

249
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:45,656
Big boring Benedict Bunny

250
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:47,779
is trying to kiss horrible Harriet Hare.

251
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,899
Do you think
he could reach her lips?

252
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,269
- Shall I pick you up at 11 o'clock then?

253
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,259
- 11 o'clock is perfect.

254
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,079
Miss Harriet, I was wondering

255
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,320
if you could come to my...

256
00:19:00,321 --> 00:19:01,834
- I really need to go.

257
00:19:08,887 --> 00:19:10,289
- Are you all right?

258
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:11,879
Those children were awful.

259
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,009
I've never been so
embarrassed in my entire life.

260
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:17,679
Headmaster Benedict heard the whole thing.

261
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,959
They were singing that horrible,
horrible Harriet Hare song

262
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,689
the entire time he was speaking to me.

263
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,843
Don't they know I have feelings too?

264
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:32,720
Well, headmaster Benedict
Bunny is never going to like

265
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:36,129
or fall in love with anyone who is called

266
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:38,133
horrible Harriet Hare.

267
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:41,029
Sometimes I think he only goes out with me

268
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,969
because he feels sorry for me.

269
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:46,373
I wish he could get to
know me, the real me.

270
00:20:09,172 --> 00:20:13,138
or just what you see

271
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,323
- Hello, oh, hi mother.

272
00:20:19,324 --> 00:20:23,760
No, I will not be bringing
Miss Harriet to dinner tonight.

273
00:20:23,761 --> 00:20:26,969
I did not chicken out
mother, she was busy.

274
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,533
She was very busy.

275
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,809
I know I've said that before.

276
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,469
No one's getting any younger mother,

277
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,633
that would be impossible.

278
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:40,093
Yes, I will ask her another time.

279
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:46,039
I agree, I think if she got
to know me she might like me

280
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,659
but I don't think she's sitting home

281
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,773
just waiting for me to ask her to dinner.

282
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,849
Look, I am not perfect at all her mother

283
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:57,529
and I know there are those who call me

284
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:01,633
big, boring Benedict Bunny
when they think I can't hear.

285
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,989
No mother, I am not cute.

286
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:08,713
I am an adult and I am
big and I am boring.

287
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,089
I do not want you to invite her for me.

288
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:15,573
I will invite her myself
when the time is right.

289
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,503
Maybe on our picnic tomorrow.

290
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,753
Yes I know it's the ninth year in a row.

291
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,713
I love you too, mother.

292
00:21:26,736 --> 00:21:31,736
Well, I can spend another
night practicing my piano.

293
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,838
I just wish Miss Harriet Hare and I

294
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:36,539
could get to know each other better.

295
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,712
But why would any creature as
lovely as Miss Harriet Hare

296
00:21:39,713 --> 00:21:44,713
fall in love with big
boring Benedict Bunny?

297
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:48,213
Maybe if Miss Harriet just got to know me.

298
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:28,717
picnic, I feel so alive

299
00:22:59,865 --> 00:23:04,865
or just what you need

300
00:23:25,597 --> 00:23:30,597
just what you need today

301
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:18,913
- 11, 12, that's a dozen.

302
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:00,779
Okay everybody, listen up.

303
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,579
Chocolate tears upstairs,

304
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,879
losers can't be choosers, fourth floor.

305
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,169
We have some changes this year,
Jelly Beans with the greens,

306
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:10,749
Marshmallows with yellow,
Whites get it right.

307
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,159
Reds use your hands.

308
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,939
If you're working the straw,
stop flapping your jaw.

309
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:19,400
We want hackers not
slackers, players not layers.

310
00:25:23,526 --> 00:25:25,089
Rappers snap to it.

311
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,633
If you work in this
room you lower the boom.

312
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:46,608
they're calling me magic

313
00:25:46,609 --> 00:25:48,686
like I know you would

314
00:25:53,091 --> 00:25:57,055
will be good if you can

315
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:19,387
with candy and money

316
00:26:19,388 --> 00:26:21,853
I gotta have a boss

317
00:26:21,854 --> 00:26:24,223
doughs, I'm the coast

318
00:26:33,615 --> 00:26:36,388
shells in the truck, holdup

319
00:26:38,412 --> 00:26:40,759
your son acting all funny

320
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,719
- Oh, it's no use, I can't
do anything with my ear.

321
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,339
Either one of them, and
on this of all days.

322
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,973
I'm having a bad ear day.

323
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,483
Hmm, too serious, I look
like I'm going to a funeral.

324
00:27:54,428 --> 00:27:56,453
No, this doesn't fit right.

325
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:02,543
Okay, fluff up my tail,
now what do you think?

326
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:04,680
Well, do you like it?

327
00:28:08,849 --> 00:28:10,210
Too puffy.

328
00:28:10,211 --> 00:28:12,233
Oh, why didn't you say so?

329
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:19,269
Thank you very much, I
appreciate your honesty.

330
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,679
Why don't you just say it?

331
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,963
I look horrible.

332
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:26,469
Well, of course I look
horrible, I'm horrible Harriet.

333
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,763
I don't even wanna go.

334
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:31,499
Anyone as wonderful and
intelligent is headmaster Benedict

335
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,233
is never gonna fall in love
with horrible Harriet Hare.

336
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:44,689
Good morning, headmaster Benedict.

337
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,309
- I'm not late, am I?

338
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:50,129
- Heavens no, you're right
on time, I admire promptness.

339
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:53,653
I was just reading the
newspaper, let me get my things.

340
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:03,009
Well, headmaster Benedict,
I thought your proposal

341
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:05,419
for more napkin holders
on cafeteria tables

342
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,483
was simply inspiring.

343
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:12,569
- That's very kind of you
Ms. Harriet, thank you.

344
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:14,869
I didn't think anyone noticed.

345
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:17,079
Honestly, I can't take all the credit,

346
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,629
it was really my mother's suggestion.

347
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,049
We were having dinner one evening

348
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,566
and I made a bit of a mess.

349
00:29:23,567 --> 00:29:28,203
I had gravy drizzling down
my shirt and globs on the...

350
00:29:30,933 --> 00:29:34,019
Well, I try to institute
new programs now and then

351
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,543
to keep things exciting.

352
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,578
- Oh, I love this song.

353
00:29:48,393 --> 00:29:50,155
- Wow, what a coincidence,
that's my favorite song.

354
00:29:50,156 --> 00:29:52,046
- Oh, you're just saying that.

355
00:29:52,047 --> 00:29:54,589
- No, it's my very favorite song.

356
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:57,607
I even sing it sometimes
when I'm by myself.

357
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:02,759
- Okay, if it's your favorite song,

358
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,333
sing me your favorite part.

359
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:17,549
I won't last without you

360
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:27,023
So what's your favorite part of the song?

361
00:30:28,975 --> 00:30:33,975
won't last without you

362
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,763
Care to dance?

363
00:30:40,693 --> 00:30:42,643
I might step on your feet.

364
00:30:46,977 --> 00:30:48,759
- I'll take my chances.

365
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,519
- If you don't mind me
saying so, Miss Harriet,

366
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,093
you sure look lovely today.

367
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:55,076
- Well, thank you, sir.

368
00:30:55,077 --> 00:30:57,343
And that's a nice vest you're wearing.

369
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,563
You do fill it nicely.

370
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,179
- Miss Harriet.

371
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,373
- Please call me Harriet.

372
00:31:07,716 --> 00:31:10,803
- Okay, I will.

373
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:15,453
Very well, Miss, I mean Harriet.

374
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:22,130
I've been thinking, that is
thinking of you, I mean of us.

375
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,617
What I mean is...

376
00:31:24,947 --> 00:31:29,470
with me, I can't go on

377
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:34,471
hang around just waiting

378
00:31:37,707 --> 00:31:39,040
- What was that?

379
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:44,632
Gross, I can't believe this.

380
00:31:47,369 --> 00:31:48,507
I can't believe this is happening.

381
00:31:48,508 --> 00:31:51,460
- Is the thought kissing
me that disgusting?

382
00:31:51,461 --> 00:31:52,293
No.

383
00:31:52,294 --> 00:31:54,614
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to, I thought you, we...

384
00:31:54,615 --> 00:31:55,447
No.

385
00:31:55,448 --> 00:31:57,409
- I really need to go.

386
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:59,379
- Miss Harriet, no.

387
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:02,722
Please, don't go, you don't understand.

388
00:32:02,723 --> 00:32:05,323
- I understand, I really do.

389
00:32:05,324 --> 00:32:07,299
I have a million things to do.

390
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,132
Let me...

391
00:32:08,133 --> 00:32:09,779
- Papers to correct.

392
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,983
- Harriet, no, please.

393
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:17,023
That's okay birdie, it's not your fault.

394
00:32:23,337 --> 00:32:26,259
No one's ever gonna fall
in love with anyone named

395
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,023
big boring Benedict Bunny.

396
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:06,903
- Okay, listen up.

397
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:11,739
I'm tired of small jobs and small rewards,

398
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,343
we're gonna rob hatch house,

399
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:16,689
and we're gonna clean it up for good.

400
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:19,639
We'll have enough goodies
to last us a year.

401
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:23,449
Cookie, you pack the supply,
Steel, tune up that truck,

402
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:25,269
make sure it doesn't backfire.

403
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,410
We don't want any busy buddies here.

404
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,329
You get all the tools and knives together.

405
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:36,330
Pinch, find as many buckets,
bags, barrels as you can.

406
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,983
We're not leaving one stinking egg behind.

407
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:43,199
Now rest of you, empty your pockets,

408
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,501
make sure you have room
to really stuff them.

409
00:33:46,502 --> 00:33:48,932
Then go outside and roll
around in the swamp.

410
00:33:48,933 --> 00:33:49,819
What?

411
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,824
- To camouflage, get it?

412
00:33:51,825 --> 00:33:53,992
Yeah, that's it!

413
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:35,313
- You moron, you said you
fixed this junk truck.

414
00:34:36,172 --> 00:34:38,729
- Oh, my beak.

415
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:42,459
I did fix it, it's the way you drive.

416
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:45,729
Every time I fix it, you
manage to rip off the oil pan

417
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:47,759
or blow the carburetor.

418
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,529
- All right, shut up the both of you.

419
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:55,530
Steel, this thing backfires
again and it's your tail.

420
00:34:55,883 --> 00:35:00,303
We wait here till they're
gone then we have some fun.

421
00:35:10,897 --> 00:35:13,279
- Colorers, great job today.

422
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,413
Not too messy I'm happy to say.

423
00:35:17,484 --> 00:35:19,999
Dippers, you worked hard, no one fell in,

424
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,595
not like last year.

425
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:30,489
Rappers, you can rap for me anytime,

426
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:33,241
though I'm not your fine shorty.

427
00:35:33,242 --> 00:35:34,074
- Uh huh.

428
00:35:38,508 --> 00:35:40,591
- I have an announcement.

429
00:35:41,747 --> 00:35:43,819
I'd like to read the output for the day,

430
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:46,087
the grand total is.

431
00:35:46,088 --> 00:35:47,402
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

432
00:35:47,403 --> 00:35:52,260
- And the total is
7,825,403 eggs processed.

433
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:01,893
That's about 600 more than last year.

434
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:06,273
Thank you again everyone,
you did a great job.

435
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,163
Be careful going home.

436
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,593
That was one impressive day.

437
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,053
I love this job.

438
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,173
- Hello.

439
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:52,979
Don't be ridiculous, of course
I wouldn't hang up on you

440
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,619
just because you're Benedict's mother.

441
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,170
Of course I can keep a promise.

442
00:36:58,546 --> 00:37:00,696
I promise I won't tell
Benedict you called.

443
00:37:01,608 --> 00:37:03,163
Why does he feel terrible?

444
00:37:04,576 --> 00:37:06,465
A Bird did what?

445
00:37:06,466 --> 00:37:08,459
Why didn't he tell me?

446
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,085
I thought...

447
00:37:10,086 --> 00:37:11,903
Oh, I'm so embarrassed.

448
00:37:13,762 --> 00:37:14,594
Really?

449
00:37:14,595 --> 00:37:16,173
He likes me, Benedict likes me!

450
00:37:18,453 --> 00:37:20,793
Of course, it'll be our little secret.

451
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,699
Absolutely, any time.

452
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,541
I would love to come to dinner

453
00:37:26,542 --> 00:37:29,349
but Benedict will have to invite me.

454
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:34,350
Oh, thank you for telling me,
it was so wonderful of you.

455
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,030
Good night, Mrs. Bunny.

456
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:45,163
Big boring Benedict Bunny
likes horrible Harriet Hare.

457
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,309
Oh, what a beautiful
evening, it's perfect!

458
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,683
Nothing could spoil
such a wonderful night.

459
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:08,187
- Ooh, she is one great looking chick.

460
00:38:08,188 --> 00:38:10,509
Oh, look at
that drumstick, I got...

461
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:11,760
- You don't remember her?

462
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:15,579
She's the old bird that
pecked off your tail

463
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,630
first time you tried to catch Hellen Hen.

464
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,359
- Oh yeah, she's a tough one.

465
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,039
- Good, well, she's gone
now so lets get moving.

466
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,963
Okay, let's go.

467
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:33,339
- Grab, get the gates.

468
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,969
Cookie, don't turn off the truck,

469
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:37,970
you know it can backfire when it starts.

470
00:38:45,896 --> 00:38:48,313
We're taking everything, now!

471
00:39:16,883 --> 00:39:18,447
What the?

472
00:39:18,448 --> 00:39:19,280
What is it?

473
00:39:19,281 --> 00:39:22,581
- Tiny Tessie detail, Ms.
Tiny Tessie was arrested

474
00:39:22,582 --> 00:39:25,343
for the robbery of Boss Baker's bake shop.

475
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:29,499
Some old birdie took
their back for you Timothy.

476
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,989
- That's my mother, you oven stuffer.

477
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:32,990
Your mother!

478
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,809
- Sergeant O'Hare gave a statement earlier

479
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:39,889
that feather prints found at
the scene were a perfect match

480
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:43,202
to Ms. Tessie's son,
Terrible Timothy Takeit.

481
00:39:43,203 --> 00:39:47,400
- You got your name in the paper, Timmy.

482
00:39:47,401 --> 00:39:49,063
- According to a reliable source,

483
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:51,609
Bakers have offered a reward

484
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:53,999
for the capture of
terrible Timothy Takeit.

485
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,159
I need to write my mother a note.

486
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,723
We can drop it off on the way
back, everyone in the truck!

487
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,208
Come on, chap chap.

488
00:40:02,209 --> 00:40:03,458
Can I have a snack?

489
00:40:03,459 --> 00:40:06,235
No, you can't have a snack.

490
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:29,241
- I'm worn out, taking
takes a lot out of you.

491
00:40:29,242 --> 00:40:31,842
- You can take that to the bank.

492
00:40:37,427 --> 00:40:39,795
- Ooh, ooh, ooh, gotta go, gotta go.

493
00:40:39,796 --> 00:40:42,839
If I don't go now, I'll
never make it to the swamp

494
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,139
and I'm not going there in the dark

495
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,913
with the rats running around.

496
00:41:10,854 --> 00:41:14,159
- Take-Its, they robbed hatch house!

497
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,333
- I told you not to turn the
engine off you dumb twat!

498
00:41:19,428 --> 00:41:21,379
There's a reward out for me,

499
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,513
you wanna wake up the whole town?

500
00:41:38,843 --> 00:41:42,659
- Good gracious, everybody,
its an emergency.

501
00:42:11,357 --> 00:42:15,940
- Oh my, it's the town bell,
I hope there isn't a fire.

502
00:42:26,996 --> 00:42:28,329
It's from Timmy.

503
00:42:30,768 --> 00:42:32,632
I just found out

504
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,513
what they did to you, I am so sorry.

505
00:42:35,474 --> 00:42:40,474
I'm afraid I hurt you again
tonight, we robbed Hatch House.

506
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:46,659
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm a terrible chicken,

507
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,729
I'm sorry I am a terrible son.

508
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:51,169
The others don't know it
yet but I'm leaving soon

509
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:54,569
to start a new life in
another place far away,

510
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:55,799
where I can never hurt you again.

511
00:42:57,402 --> 00:42:58,259
I
know you will never forget

512
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:59,953
how bad I had been.

513
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:03,740
I hope you will never
forget how much I love you.

514
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:08,619
Maybe someday things will be different.

515
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:11,325
I love you Mommy, Timmy.

516
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:32,150
- Grasshopper, you can
stop ringing that bell.

517
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,503
What's going on?

518
00:43:36,024 --> 00:43:38,363
- It's all gone, it's all gone.

519
00:43:39,205 --> 00:43:40,624
What's all gone?

520
00:43:40,625 --> 00:43:41,457
- Good gracious.

521
00:43:41,458 --> 00:43:42,515
- What's all gone?

522
00:43:42,516 --> 00:43:43,989
- Everything.

523
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:45,489
- What do you mean everything?

524
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:47,676
What are you talking about?

525
00:43:47,677 --> 00:43:51,179
- I mean, everything including
Easter has been taken.

526
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,419
Good gracious, good gracious.

527
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:55,228
Hatch house is empty, I checked it myself.

528
00:43:55,229 --> 00:43:59,872
The Take-Its took every last basket!

529
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:03,979
- Check it out, deputy Hopper.

530
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:06,889
Okay folks, everybody remain calm.

531
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:10,279
I'm sure our pal Good Gracious
here had a one too many

532
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,289
butterscotch jelly beans tonight

533
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:13,599
and probably had a nightmare.

534
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,129
- I'm completely out of butterscotch

535
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:18,289
and this is a nightmare
but I not dreaming.

536
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:20,989
The Take-Its truck
backfired under my porch

537
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:25,135
and it woke me up, I saw the
eggs myself with my binoculars.

538
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:29,019
- Hatch house is empty Sergeant,

539
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,279
he's telling the truth, sir.

540
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:33,376
- Good gracious, of course
I'm telling the truth.

541
00:44:33,377 --> 00:44:35,021
- Take-Its?

542
00:44:35,022 --> 00:44:38,312
Save me, I don't wanna
get chickennapped again.

543
00:44:38,313 --> 00:44:39,993
- Oh, they're not here.

544
00:44:40,912 --> 00:44:42,179
I followed the Take-Its,

545
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:46,053
they were headed to old
Takeit Town with our eggs.

546
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:50,133
- They stole my Hokey
pokey records last time.

547
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:53,205
- Keep quite!

548
00:44:54,299 --> 00:44:57,679
Y'all sound like a bunch of old hens.

549
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,430
We are a bunch of old hens.

550
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,909
- Take-Its believe they
can come to our town

551
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:07,412
and just take whatever they want.

552
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:10,223
Well, I say, we're not
gonna take it any longer.

553
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:14,249
Everyone's Easter was stolen tonight.

554
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:15,679
We need to go to the swamp,

555
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:19,183
get our eggs back and kick their tails.

556
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:25,439
- I have an idea that could work.

557
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,029
If we disguise ourselves like Take-Its,

558
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:32,289
we can sneak through the swamp
and into old Takeit Town.

559
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:34,029
While the Take-Its are sleeping,

560
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:36,419
we'll tie them up and take back our eggs.

561
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:39,149
Anyway, Ms. Claire-line is right,

562
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:42,420
I'm going to get the eggs
back, who's going with us?

563
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:47,069
- I'm going with you Headmaster Benedict

564
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:48,709
and Ms. Claire-line.

565
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:51,184
I want the eggs back.

566
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:56,049
- I'm going too, I'm
small, they won't see me.

567
00:45:56,050 --> 00:45:58,699
Good gracious, I can spy on the Take-Its

568
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:01,333
and find out what they did with the eggs.

569
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:06,902
- Last fall I was
chickennapped by Take-Its

570
00:46:06,903 --> 00:46:10,919
and dragged through the
swamp to old Takeit Town.

571
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:14,059
I know the whole route
to that nasty old place

572
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:16,245
and I'm ready to lead the way.

573
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:21,799
- I'll go of course, to protect you all.

574
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,639
- Thank you Sergeant, but
you need to stay in EggTown

575
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,259
to protect our citizens,

576
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:30,183
just in case the Take-Its
come back and we don't.

577
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:35,089
- You're right and you are
the boss Headmaster Benedict.

578
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:37,169
- No, I'm the boss.

579
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:39,999
Listen, they robbed me, I'm going too.

580
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,272
- Bossy, you're not going without me.

581
00:46:43,273 --> 00:46:45,083
- I don't go anywhere without you,

582
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:47,783
with your permission, Benedict.

583
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,843
- Of course, Boss and thank
you and you too Bernadette.

584
00:46:55,036 --> 00:46:59,286
To the swamp, to
the swamp, to the swamp,

585
00:47:00,181 --> 00:47:02,771
to the swamp, to the swamp!

586
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:06,329
Well, the
brave little group went home

587
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:10,179
to put on the darkest and
shabbiest clothes they could find,

588
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:13,833
so no one would spot them
traveling to old Takeit Town.

589
00:47:31,758 --> 00:47:33,758
- I hear someone coming.

590
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:35,570
Whose that?

591
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:39,260
I don't know who that is.

592
00:47:42,194 --> 00:47:44,157
- I'm going with you.

593
00:47:45,116 --> 00:47:49,263
- Ms. Tessie, you can't come,
you've been through enough.

594
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:52,839
- That's exactly why I'm going.

595
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:56,429
My son is the reason you're all here,

596
00:47:56,430 --> 00:48:00,929
someone in my family has
to make things right.

597
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:05,430
Please, let me come, I
won't be any trouble.

598
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:09,609
- I think Ms. Tessie has as
much right to come as any of us.

599
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:11,884
- Okay Tessie, let's go.

600
00:48:39,055 --> 00:48:40,489
- Good gracious, good gracious.

601
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:44,117
Do you think the Take-Its
are watching us right now?

602
00:48:54,713 --> 00:48:57,989
- That bird looks like he's following us.

603
00:48:57,990 --> 00:49:00,923
- I hope he isn't a spy for the Take-Its.

604
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:04,913
- I think it's your imagination.

605
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,973
- What is that awful smell?

606
00:49:17,949 --> 00:49:19,449
- It's disgusting.

607
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,283
- Dead bodies, has to be.

608
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:27,333
- Nope, that's the
stink of polluted water.

609
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:33,897
- We're going the right way,
we need to cross this stream.

610
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:39,249
- I can't put my toes in that.

611
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:41,437
- Would you rather swim across?

612
00:50:03,676 --> 00:50:05,459
- Do you hear that?

613
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:06,859
- Hear what?

614
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:07,960
I don't hear anything.

615
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:12,930
- Exactly, even the crickets
have stopped singing.

616
00:50:23,254 --> 00:50:27,043
- Oh my, what a beautiful flower.

617
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:31,033
I've never seen a red violet.

618
00:50:33,857 --> 00:50:37,460
Oh, that smell, it's so unusual.

619
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:45,309
- That's odd, I don't ever
recall seeing red violets before.

620
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:47,413
Wait a minute, Ms. Tessie.

621
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:52,149
No, they're wolf vine violets.

622
00:50:58,170 --> 00:50:59,770
- Oh my God, hold on Ms. Tessie.

623
00:51:04,015 --> 00:51:04,847
- It's choking me.

624
00:51:04,848 --> 00:51:06,523
Benedict, use your knife.

625
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:12,689
- Cut all the flowers, make it bleed.

626
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:14,240
It's the only way to weaken it.

627
00:51:15,711 --> 00:51:17,294
Help me!

628
00:51:19,127 --> 00:51:21,153
Help me, help me!

629
00:51:21,154 --> 00:51:23,237
- I have her, quick, run.

630
00:51:34,547 --> 00:51:37,639
- I need to get her bandaged,
she's covered in blood.

631
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:40,669
- She's bleeding but I
can't find the wounds.

632
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:44,623
- Benedict, that isn't Miss
Tessie's blood, it's yours.

633
00:51:45,701 --> 00:51:46,534
- No!

634
00:51:48,747 --> 00:51:51,414
- Oh Benedict, you are so brave.

635
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:02,030
- Ms. Tessie, your shawl, it's gone.

636
00:52:08,256 --> 00:52:09,756
- Oh, there it is.

637
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,373
- I'm sorry, Miss Tessie.

638
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:20,013
- That shawl brought me nothing
but trouble, good riddance.

639
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:35,763
- Howling is louder.

640
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:40,453
- Those wolves are closer.

641
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:43,337
- That bird is still following us.

642
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:53,119
I hope he's not leading the wolves to us.

643
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:57,233
- That sign, it was here
before, I remember it.

644
00:52:58,380 --> 00:52:59,859
Good,
that means we're all going

645
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:02,743
the right way and we're all gonna die.

646
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:06,207
- I'd like to be home right now.

647
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:17,983
- Oh, I don't wanna go in.

648
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:23,593
- We don't have a choice,
I don't know any other way.

649
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:25,510
- I hate to say this.

650
00:53:26,697 --> 00:53:29,049
- What, what is it?

651
00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:32,050
- I've read about cemetery swamp
pools, how they're haunted.

652
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:34,369
- Haunted by what?

653
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:37,159
- There's a legend about
a spirit called Muck.

654
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,529
They say it'll eat you

655
00:53:38,530 --> 00:53:40,869
but first it sucks out your
vital juices through your...

656
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:42,720
I don't wanna hear the rest?

657
00:53:46,537 --> 00:53:49,579
- Harriet, do you believe
in that weird stuff?

658
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:51,713
- I didn't say I believe in it.

659
00:54:01,731 --> 00:54:06,731
- Oh, it's no use, we're
stuck in

660
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:10,900
- Stop screaming, calm down or
we'll never get out of this.

661
00:54:12,078 --> 00:54:16,490
- Oh Harriet, you were
right, why didn't we listen?

662
00:54:16,491 --> 00:54:18,241
Trespassers.

663
00:54:19,265 --> 00:54:20,669
- Quiet, did you hear that?

664
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:23,170
Trespassers must die.

665
00:54:25,043 --> 00:54:26,710
You must pay a toll.

666
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:31,499
- How dare you threaten us?

667
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,979
We've done nothing to you, let us go.

668
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:35,363
- Boss, keep quite.

669
00:54:36,550 --> 00:54:39,802
- I've waited for you, wretched Take-Its.

670
00:54:39,803 --> 00:54:44,334
- Take-Its, we're not Take-Its.

671
00:54:46,537 --> 00:54:47,370
- Explain!

672
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,883
- Please, please, don't hurt us.

673
00:54:56,919 --> 00:54:59,981
We're from EggTown disguised as Take-Its.

674
00:54:59,982 --> 00:55:01,743
The Take-Its stole our Easter eggs.

675
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:10,010
Sir please, my name is Benedict
Bunny, what may I call you?

676
00:55:11,330 --> 00:55:16,280
- It is of no consequence but
I am the one they call Muck.

677
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,143
You must be their leader,

678
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:27,463
the one they call Terrible Timothy.

679
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:32,009
- I told you, I'm Benedict Bunny.

680
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:36,769
Well, actually they call me,
big boring Benedict Bunny

681
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:38,926
but I'm not a Takeit.

682
00:55:38,927 --> 00:55:41,150
- Take-Its or not, you are trespassers

683
00:55:43,041 --> 00:55:47,291
and trespassers must die,
did you not see the sign?

684
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:53,749
- We did but the Take-Its stole our eggs

685
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:58,639
and we've come risking
everything to get those eggs back

686
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:02,049
or else no children anywhere

687
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:04,809
will ever get their Easter baskets.

688
00:56:04,810 --> 00:56:07,483
- I will only eat one of you.

689
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:13,630
Now, choose the one among you to be eaten.

690
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,063
- We can't choose on
of our own to be eaten.

691
00:56:22,209 --> 00:56:25,183
- Choose or you will all die.

692
00:56:26,775 --> 00:56:29,503
Each of you will whisper to me one name,

693
00:56:30,857 --> 00:56:33,860
the one whose name is spoke the most times

694
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:37,927
shall be my victim.

695
00:56:43,322 --> 00:56:45,909
- I can't believe this is happening.

696
00:56:49,582 --> 00:56:51,665
I know it's me, isn't it?

697
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,126
I'm so boring, I would be the one everyone

698
00:56:58,127 --> 00:56:59,877
would miss the least.

699
00:57:11,787 --> 00:57:14,839
We had a deal Muck, set them free.

700
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,507
You said only one of us has to die.

701
00:57:22,392 --> 00:57:23,225
- Oh no.

702
00:57:30,907 --> 00:57:32,409
- It's you, Muck?

703
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:35,023
- Yes, Benedict, my thanks to all of you.

704
00:57:36,625 --> 00:57:40,139
This is how I used to be clean
and free before selfishness,

705
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:44,333
cruelty and waste conspired to
cast this evil spell upon me.

706
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:48,639
I asked you for a victim
expecting you to betray each other

707
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:52,269
but instead you each
unselfishly chose to whisper

708
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:54,003
your own name to me.

709
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:56,609
It was the purity in your hearts

710
00:57:56,610 --> 00:57:59,013
that released me from my bondage.

711
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:02,319
- What happens to you now, Muck?

712
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,869
- Look for me in the fallen rain,

713
00:58:04,870 --> 00:58:06,753
the snowy hill and the morning dew.

714
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:12,970
Farewell my friends and good
luck on your journey as well.

715
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:23,729
- If we ever get out of this
place, I'm changing my life.

716
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:24,709
- What would you change?

717
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:26,973
- Every day I teach
someone else's children.

718
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:32,307
Maybe someday, I'd like to teach my own.

719
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:34,698
- That would be nice.

720
00:58:42,288 --> 00:58:44,757
- This doesn't look familiar.

721
00:58:44,758 --> 00:58:48,259
- Helen, please tell me we're not lost.

722
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:51,969
- Sorry, I can't remember
if we go left or right.

723
00:58:51,970 --> 00:58:55,559
It was a year ago, my mind was on escaping

724
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:58,119
not finding my way back here.

725
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:01,559
- Gracious, oh Benedict,
you need to do something.

726
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:04,359
- You're right, we have to
split up to confuse the wolves,

727
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:06,219
they won't know which way to go.

728
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:07,991
Boss, you take Bernadette,
Harriet, Clair-line

729
00:59:07,992 --> 00:59:10,239
Hellen and Tessie, Good
Gracious, you come with me.

730
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:11,072
- I'm going with you, Benedict.

731
00:59:11,073 --> 00:59:14,039
- No, you're not Harriet,
it's too dangerous,

732
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:15,749
I want you to go with Boss.

733
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:18,999
- Benedict, in case something happens

734
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,549
and we don't make it out of this mess,

735
00:59:21,550 --> 00:59:23,150
I just want you to know how much

736
00:59:26,364 --> 00:59:28,845
I loved seeing you everyday.

737
00:59:30,473 --> 00:59:32,306
- Everybody, run, now!

738
00:59:38,589 --> 00:59:42,649
- They're following us,
the others should be safe.

739
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:43,483
- I hope so.

740
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:57,993
- Good gracious, good gracious.

741
00:59:59,328 --> 01:00:00,649
It's none of my business,

742
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:03,549
but I think Ms. Harriet's
in love with you.

743
01:00:03,550 --> 01:00:04,383
- I wish.

744
01:00:09,646 --> 01:00:13,249
Why did you say you think Ms.
Harriet's in love with me?

745
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:15,472
- Oh, good gracious, good gracious.

746
01:00:15,473 --> 01:00:18,029
It's obvious to everyone
but you, Benedict.

747
01:00:18,030 --> 01:00:20,519
What do you think she was
trying to tell you back there?

748
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,906
I can't believe you didn't at least say,

749
01:00:22,907 --> 01:00:27,737
"Be careful, Harriet" or "I
love seeing you every day too."

750
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:33,729
- I wanted to, I was going
to but I didn't want her

751
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:36,099
to get hurt and the wolves distracted me.

752
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:39,309
- Well, what distracted you
for the past nine years?

753
01:00:39,310 --> 01:00:42,659
- Look, Good Gracious, I've
never been able to master

754
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:45,143
the nerve to tell her how much I love her.

755
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,839
I mean, what did you expect?

756
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:53,129
They call me big boring Benedict Bunny.

757
01:00:53,130 --> 01:00:55,243
- I hope you get another chance, Benedict.

758
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:00,530
I hope the wolves didn't...

759
01:01:21,423 --> 01:01:25,844
if you'd ever told me

760
01:01:25,845 --> 01:01:30,845
night trying to find her

761
01:01:46,429 --> 01:01:49,530
time I won't fail

762
01:01:49,531 --> 01:01:52,263
in a prison I've loathed

763
01:01:54,641 --> 01:01:57,535
ended, my ways I've amended

764
01:02:14,819 --> 01:02:16,867
find love in my life

765
01:02:19,997 --> 01:02:22,506
move mountains if I want

766
01:02:37,312 --> 01:02:39,657
back from the world

767
01:02:42,499 --> 01:02:44,933
and I'll never forget

768
01:02:44,934 --> 01:02:47,884
I don't have regrets

769
01:02:47,885 --> 01:02:50,331
in life is for certain

770
01:02:56,308 --> 01:03:01,308
feeling like, wow, wow

771
01:03:40,564 --> 01:03:41,981
Harriet! Harriet!

772
01:03:43,023 --> 01:03:44,440
Harriet! Harriet!

773
01:03:46,509 --> 01:03:48,926
- That's Benedict, follow me.

774
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:52,409
Benedict, where are you?

775
01:03:52,410 --> 01:03:54,183
Good Gracious, over here.

776
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:07,490
- That's the bird that's
been following us.

777
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:10,679
I thought he was spying for the Take-Its,

778
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,249
he's showing us the way.

779
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:14,439
Good gracious,
where are you going?

780
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:18,463
- Oh, I don't believe it,
it's you from the picnic.

781
01:04:21,398 --> 01:04:23,667
Thank you my brave friend.

782
01:04:28,810 --> 01:04:31,239
That must be the opening to the tunnel

783
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,973
that leads to the Takeit's layer.

784
01:04:38,174 --> 01:04:40,439
- Good gracious, good
gracious, not so fast.

785
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:43,179
This is a job for a grasshopper.

786
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:44,599
I'll go in first and make sure

787
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:46,399
the Take-Its are still asleep.

788
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:49,623
I'm so small they won't notice
me even if they wake up.

789
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:51,669
- Only you can make sure

790
01:04:51,670 --> 01:04:54,399
we don't walk into a nasty situation.

791
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,283
Absolutely.

792
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:03,793
- Good gracious.

793
01:05:06,630 --> 01:05:09,273
How many cigars can they possibly smoke?

794
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:13,837
That was a close call.

795
01:05:22,315 --> 01:05:24,482
- Well, look what I found.

796
01:05:26,905 --> 01:05:28,459
Look Cookie, you're always complaining

797
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:30,429
you never get any fresh ingredients.

798
01:05:30,430 --> 01:05:31,728
- Oh, you're twisting it.

799
01:05:31,729 --> 01:05:33,733
- Well what could be fresher than this?

800
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:40,669
- No, toast him with the stolen eggs.

801
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:45,123
- No, stuff him in muck
spice and marsh him in gravy.

802
01:05:46,483 --> 01:05:50,699
- You idiots, we got a
gazillion Easter baskets

803
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:53,239
chock full of fresh goodies.

804
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:55,190
This one's too scrawny and sour to eat.

805
01:05:58,190 --> 01:06:02,149
- I know, I know, Grasshopper sandwiches.

806
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:06,019
- Enough, you my scrumptious little friend

807
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:10,503
are going to be delicious grasshopper pie.

808
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:16,373
Now back off, all of you,
I got me some baking to do.

809
01:06:17,253 --> 01:06:19,109
I like that too.

810
01:06:19,110 --> 01:06:21,293
- Not much to you, aye Grasshopper?

811
01:06:23,010 --> 01:06:25,941
- I think we should let him go.

812
01:06:25,942 --> 01:06:29,923
Poor little guy, he seems like a nice guy.

813
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:35,497
- Yeah, I agree, we
really should let him go.

814
01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:39,999
We are so sorry, my little friend,

815
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,179
we didn't mean to scare you.

816
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:43,012
We feel terrible.

817
01:06:43,013 --> 01:06:48,013
- You look so thin, we've
decided to let you go.

818
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:50,659
What kind of host would we be

819
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:54,899
if we let you leave
weary and tired and thin?

820
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:58,279
How about an egg to fatten
you, I mean, to fill you up?

821
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:01,419
Strengthen your legs for
the long journey home.

822
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:02,959
- Oh good gracious, good gracious.

823
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:05,529
Oh, you are all so very kind.

824
01:07:05,530 --> 01:07:08,369
I love eggs but I really must be going.

825
01:07:08,370 --> 01:07:10,520
I don't wanna wear out
my welcome, you now.

826
01:07:12,450 --> 01:07:16,769
- Don't worry about that,
wouldn't you like a little snack?

827
01:07:16,770 --> 01:07:18,909
- Oh, I'm not hungry.

828
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:20,889
- That's too bad.

829
01:07:20,890 --> 01:07:23,369
- I'm not hungry, I'm starving!

830
01:07:23,370 --> 01:07:24,409
Oh, good gracious, good gracious.

831
01:07:24,410 --> 01:07:25,779
My stomach isn't grumbling,

832
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:27,989
it's sending out a formal protest.

833
01:07:27,990 --> 01:07:31,699
You guys take the cake, I
mean that in a good way.

834
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:34,639
You didn't even know I was
coming and here you are

835
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:36,659
inviting me for breakfast.

836
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:41,143
I'd love some egg right
now to strengthen my legs.

837
01:07:47,510 --> 01:07:49,989
Good gracious, good gracious.

838
01:07:49,990 --> 01:07:54,806
These eggs are delicious,
thank you so much.

839
01:07:54,807 --> 01:07:56,079
They're just...

840
01:08:06,096 --> 01:08:09,013
The pain, everything is going dark.

841
01:08:13,374 --> 01:08:15,957
I can't, feel a thing, help me.

842
01:08:19,270 --> 01:08:22,743
Take-Its, I'm dying.

843
01:08:29,410 --> 01:08:30,747
The eggs are poisoned.

844
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:33,737
Oh, no, poisoned eggs?

845
01:08:33,738 --> 01:08:36,390
- It's rat poison and now I'm nothing

846
01:08:38,205 --> 01:08:41,973
but poisoned grasshopper meat.

847
01:08:48,143 --> 01:08:48,976
- Oh, no.

848
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:56,259
They tricked us, that
could have been one of us.

849
01:08:56,260 --> 01:08:59,579
They let us steal these poisoned eggs.

850
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:02,369
They were trying to croak us.

851
01:09:02,370 --> 01:09:04,759
- Have they no shame?

852
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:06,149
- They're evil.

853
01:09:06,150 --> 01:09:09,209
- You can't trust anyone today.

854
01:09:09,210 --> 01:09:13,569
- Wait a minute, not so fast.

855
01:09:13,570 --> 01:09:15,579
That grasshopper and his friends

856
01:09:15,580 --> 01:09:18,679
came here to steal those eggs back.

857
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:20,719
They put a lot of time and effort

858
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:23,676
into decorating and packing and...

859
01:09:23,677 --> 01:09:25,593
- You know what that means?

860
01:09:26,550 --> 01:09:29,739
- They don't know the
eggs are poisoned either.

861
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:33,469
Rat poison must have accidentally
spilled into the sugar.

862
01:09:35,530 --> 01:09:37,639
We're outta here, let's hide in the swamp.

863
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:40,549
We'll let them steal
back their poisoned eggs.

864
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:43,908
After they all croak
like their little friend

865
01:09:43,909 --> 01:09:46,409
EggTown will be wide open.

866
01:09:46,410 --> 01:09:49,139
- We'll live at the bake shop.

867
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:52,356
- We'll eat anything we
want anytime we want.

868
01:09:52,357 --> 01:09:53,328
- Yes.

869
01:09:53,329 --> 01:09:55,395
- I'll never have to cook again.

870
01:09:55,396 --> 01:09:57,813
All right, way to go.

871
01:10:02,041 --> 01:10:04,079
Let's go.

872
01:10:17,259 --> 01:10:19,292
I gotta stop smoking.

873
01:10:19,293 --> 01:10:20,125
Hurry up.

874
01:10:20,126 --> 01:10:22,126
Hey, come on.

875
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,989
- Good Gracious said he'd
be back in 10 minutes.

876
01:10:58,990 --> 01:11:00,799
- Something went terribly wrong,

877
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,763
Good Gracious is always punctual.

878
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:06,109
- Our little friend would
be here if he could be here.

879
01:11:06,110 --> 01:11:07,789
They've captured him or worse.

880
01:11:07,790 --> 01:11:10,649
- He went in first to make
sure it was safe for all of us,

881
01:11:10,650 --> 01:11:13,395
we owe it to Good Gracious to rescue him.

882
01:11:13,396 --> 01:11:14,263
- I agree.

883
01:11:15,130 --> 01:11:16,273
- Let's go.

884
01:11:21,956 --> 01:11:23,282
- What?

885
01:11:27,890 --> 01:11:29,989
- That's it then, I'll lead the way.

886
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:33,149
Harriet, you follow me, Ms.
Tessie, you get behind Helen.

887
01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:35,429
Helen, make sure you stay with Ms. Tessie.

888
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:37,238
Clair-line, you cover their backs.

889
01:11:37,239 --> 01:11:38,129
- Good.

890
01:11:38,130 --> 01:11:40,229
- Boss, you and Bernadette stay in back

891
01:11:40,230 --> 01:11:42,369
just in case they sneak in behind us.

892
01:11:42,370 --> 01:11:45,229
Everyone take your
positions, we are going in.

893
01:11:45,230 --> 01:11:46,523
- Lead the way Benedict.

894
01:12:06,910 --> 01:12:10,629
- Okay, they could be hiding
so don't wander off too far

895
01:12:10,630 --> 01:12:12,280
while you look for Good Gracious.

896
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:34,209
Why would they abandon this place

897
01:12:34,210 --> 01:12:36,781
and leave the door wide open?

898
01:12:37,615 --> 01:12:40,753
- Oh no, Good Gracious, no.

899
01:12:44,432 --> 01:12:46,284
He was so young.

900
01:12:46,285 --> 01:12:48,297
- He was so brave.

901
01:12:56,518 --> 01:13:01,453
- Even dead he's the
loveliest shade of green.

902
01:13:06,542 --> 01:13:08,689
- Good gracious, good gracious, I'm alive.

903
01:13:08,690 --> 01:13:12,399
I'm just faking it but
those are the nicest things

904
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,483
anybody has ever said about me.

905
01:13:16,669 --> 01:13:18,429
What?

906
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:21,349
- You're the best
friends anybody ever had,

907
01:13:21,350 --> 01:13:23,269
you risked your lives for me.

908
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:25,289
I'll never forget this moment,

909
01:13:25,290 --> 01:13:26,989
but we're not out of the woods yet.

910
01:13:26,990 --> 01:13:28,829
The Take-Its are hiding outside,

911
01:13:28,830 --> 01:13:31,319
they could return any minute.

912
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:32,799
- But we thought you were dead.

913
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:35,609
- I played possum, I outsmarted them

914
01:13:35,610 --> 01:13:37,899
and I don't wanna be
here when they find out.

915
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:38,732
- Oh, no.

916
01:13:38,733 --> 01:13:40,279
- Quick, grab the create
of eggs on the floor,

917
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:41,969
I'll explain it on the way home.

918
01:13:41,970 --> 01:13:44,023
Let's take our eggs and beat it.

919
01:13:54,265 --> 01:13:56,069
The Take-Its haven't unpacked the baskets

920
01:13:56,070 --> 01:13:57,033
from the truck yet.

921
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:01,089
It's parked behind this tunnel mountain,

922
01:14:01,090 --> 01:14:02,890
we can drive it back to EggTown.

923
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:17,151
Oh, good gracious, that was
close, no one's following us.

924
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:21,300
We'll make it if this hunk
of junk doesn't fall apart.

925
01:14:39,031 --> 01:14:40,028
Did everyone make it?

926
01:14:40,029 --> 01:14:42,279
Yeah, I think so.

927
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:44,849
Where's Timothy.

928
01:14:44,850 --> 01:14:49,589
He's not here, he
must be outside with the wolves.

929
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:51,849
Should we help him?

930
01:14:51,850 --> 01:14:52,979
- You wanna go out there?

931
01:14:52,980 --> 01:14:54,303
Forget him.

932
01:14:56,470 --> 01:15:00,169
- Okay, I'm hungry, make
us something to eat.

933
01:15:00,170 --> 01:15:03,863
I got a bad feeling we ain't
going anywhere for a while.

934
01:15:04,830 --> 01:15:08,519
- You idiots, we're out of
food, we didn't stock up

935
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:10,700
because we were going
to move into EggTown.

936
01:15:11,895 --> 01:15:15,379
- They're out of food, what now Dagger?

937
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:16,773
- We wait.

938
01:15:28,318 --> 01:15:29,509
- Are you all right?

939
01:15:29,510 --> 01:15:32,499
- Definitely, I'm better than all right.

940
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:35,349
I have the bravest friends in the world.

941
01:15:35,350 --> 01:15:37,349
We have our eggs back.

942
01:15:37,350 --> 01:15:42,024
I'm feeling like wow,
anything is possible.

943
01:15:42,858 --> 01:15:44,283
- Wow, yay!

944
01:15:51,430 --> 01:15:53,059
- We're out of forest edge.

945
01:15:53,060 --> 01:15:55,359
Look, everyone is gathered on the commons,

946
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:58,809
they're all waiting for
us, but how could that be?

947
01:15:58,810 --> 01:16:01,458
- Bossy, beep the horn.

948
01:16:01,459 --> 01:16:03,963
Yes, yes, by all means beep.

949
01:16:07,434 --> 01:16:08,823
- Hey, that's my mother.

950
01:16:09,790 --> 01:16:12,557
Hey mom, over here.

951
01:16:25,234 --> 01:16:27,459
How did you know were coming?

952
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:28,760
- A little birdie told me.

953
01:16:39,530 --> 01:16:41,869
Tonight, we EggTown are celebrating

954
01:16:41,870 --> 01:16:46,870
the return of our heroes,
our eggs and our confidence.

955
01:16:49,660 --> 01:16:53,449
So in appreciation, we
are presenting our heroes

956
01:16:53,450 --> 01:16:55,319
with fitting tributes.

957
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:59,543
First, the unsung hero
award goes to, Hellen Hen.

958
01:17:11,673 --> 01:17:16,670
The leadership award goes
to, Miss Claire-line Clack.

959
01:17:26,155 --> 01:17:31,075
The teamwork award goes to,
Boss and Bernadette Baker.

960
01:17:38,067 --> 01:17:40,849
And I have to award for
performing above and beyond

961
01:17:40,850 --> 01:17:45,850
the call of duty goes to
well, Miss Tiny Tessie.

962
01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:57,929
The next award is really
two awards in one,

963
01:17:57,930 --> 01:18:00,769
for uncommon courage in
the face of certain death

964
01:18:00,770 --> 01:18:03,559
and for outsmarting the
enemy with strategy,

965
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:07,059
the showstopper grasshopper award goes to,

966
01:18:07,060 --> 01:18:09,303
Good Gracious Grasshopper.

967
01:18:19,572 --> 01:18:21,999
And now a very special award

968
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,749
for selfless service in the line of duty,

969
01:18:24,750 --> 01:18:28,070
the bravery award goes
to, Ms. Harriet Hare.

970
01:18:36,415 --> 01:18:37,919
- She's our teacher.

971
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:39,409
- She's so smart.

972
01:18:39,410 --> 01:18:42,099
- And finally I'm proud to present

973
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:46,770
EggTown's action hero award
for boldness, determination

974
01:18:47,770 --> 01:18:50,779
and for keeping cool in
the face of great peril,

975
01:18:50,780 --> 01:18:54,149
I am so proud to present this award

976
01:18:54,150 --> 01:18:58,303
to our music teacher and
headmaster, Benedict Bunny.

977
01:19:06,532 --> 01:19:10,409
We have refreshments on the
common so enjoy yourselves.

978
01:19:10,410 --> 01:19:13,639
Let the record show that
from this day forward,

979
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:18,375
today shall be known as
Easter Egg Escapade Day.

980
01:19:22,294 --> 01:19:25,795
- I can't believe we
made it back to EggTown.

981
01:19:25,796 --> 01:19:30,529
- I know, it's almost as
if it was all a bad dream.

982
01:19:30,530 --> 01:19:32,453
- Well, it wasn't all bad.

983
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:36,405
Thank you for being concerned about me.

984
01:19:36,406 --> 01:19:40,849
- Oh, you're welcome and thank you for,

985
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:43,939
well, thank you for everything.

986
01:19:43,940 --> 01:19:46,050
I guess now that this escapade is over

987
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:48,740
everything can get back to normal.

988
01:19:50,090 --> 01:19:53,173
- Benedict, everything
can't go back to normal.

989
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:55,729
When I was lost in the swamp

990
01:19:55,730 --> 01:19:58,839
I realized I might never get out alive.

991
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:00,990
I thought about all
the things I'm missing.

992
01:20:02,530 --> 01:20:04,530
I'm not coming back to school, Benedict.

993
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:06,869
What?

994
01:20:06,870 --> 01:20:07,870
- You know what Benedict?

995
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:12,133
I was lost, but I've finally found myself.

996
01:20:13,070 --> 01:20:18,053
I'm not ready to lose that
tomorrow, so, goodbye Benedict.

997
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,245
Oh, no.

998
01:20:30,437 --> 01:20:32,519
- What do I do? What do I do?

999
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:34,053
Don't leave Harriet.

1000
01:20:36,550 --> 01:20:38,050
- She can't hear you Benedict.

1001
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:46,480
- Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm sorry to bother you.

1002
01:20:46,730 --> 01:20:49,623
There's just one more
announcement I need to make.

1003
01:20:50,814 --> 01:20:55,814
I can't live without you

1004
01:21:00,291 --> 01:21:05,291
I won't last without you

1005
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:16,799
I won't lose you again.

1006
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:17,763
- I love you.

1007
01:21:42,235 --> 01:21:43,568
- Good gracious!

1008
01:21:46,911 --> 01:21:50,059
Good gracious, having an
adventure certainly is tiring.

1009
01:21:50,060 --> 01:21:52,369
I think I'll pass up the free refreshments

1010
01:21:52,370 --> 01:21:54,210
and just go straight home.

1011
01:22:07,782 --> 01:22:11,469
Home, home, sweet home.

1012
01:22:11,470 --> 01:22:15,229
I haven't had a jelly bean
in, I don't know how long.

1013
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:18,133
A butterscotch would
certainly hit the spot.

1014
01:22:18,134 --> 01:22:22,375
the grasshoppers roam

1015
01:22:22,376 --> 01:22:23,379
What's this?

1016
01:22:26,550 --> 01:22:29,489
It's from terrible Timothy Takeit.

1017
01:22:29,490 --> 01:22:33,263
- Hey, little grasshopper,
I saw you breathing.

1018
01:22:36,308 --> 01:22:37,733
- Take good care of my mother.

1019
01:23:05,456 --> 01:23:10,034
take a chance in the sea

1020
01:23:14,358 --> 01:23:19,358
I'll love you too till I die

1021
01:23:44,130 --> 01:23:47,819
- You look strong enough
but it's backbreaking work.

1022
01:23:47,820 --> 01:23:49,909
You have to be willing to work hard.

1023
01:23:49,910 --> 01:23:52,913
- Sir, I wanna work hard.

1024
01:23:53,870 --> 01:23:55,889
Well, Timothy worked hard

1025
01:23:55,890 --> 01:23:58,833
and the farmer never regretted
his decision to hire him.

1026
01:23:59,870 --> 01:24:02,659
What happened to all of our other friends?

1027
01:24:02,660 --> 01:24:06,149
Well, their lives soon returned to normal.

1028
01:24:06,150 --> 01:24:07,559
Oh, and by the way,

1029
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:10,319
if you should ever be
passing through EggTown,

1030
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:14,689
look for the tiniest house
on a top of the tallest tree

1031
01:24:14,690 --> 01:24:17,707
and I'm pretty sure you'll
see Good Gracious Grasshopper

1032
01:24:17,708 --> 01:24:20,493
munching jelly beans on his porch.

1033
01:24:21,370 --> 01:24:26,366
And the Take-Its, well
now, that's another story.

1034
01:24:38,430 --> 01:24:42,860
comes along, comes along

1035
01:24:42,861 --> 01:24:47,161
someone sings your song

1036
01:26:56,367 --> 01:27:01,367
loves me when I'm wrong

1037
01:27:02,489 --> 01:27:07,489
said our love will not end
