<i>[Mingma in Nepali] </i>The weather was good,

<i>[Nims in English] It's super deep.</i>

<i>There was a point where I gave up,</i>

<i>"Nims, this is not going to work."</i>

<i>Nims poked his head inside the tent.</i>

<i>[tense music playing]</i>

<i>We were hoping</i>
<i>that he had passed in the night.</i>

202
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,240
<i>To consider that he had survived</i>
<i>that long at that altitude,</i>

203
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,160

{\an8}<i>[tense music continues]</i>

205
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,520

<i>He was just gonna die in hope.</i>

<i>[Nims] </i>HACE is

00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,120
<i>He was a climber who was lost.</i>

<i>He had HACE as well.</i>

508
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:17,520

<i>whilst also making decisions</i>
<i>quickly and accurately.</i>

<i>For context, we've had</i>

<i>[Nims] </i>Physically, I believe

<i>that he was able</i>

<i>[Messner] </i>Some climbers criticized Nirmal,

<i>"This is a really bad idea."</i>

824
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:17,120
<i>where climbers</i>
<i>were swept down the mountain.</i>

825
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:22,560
<i>We, along with all the other teams,</i>
<i>made the decision to turn back.</i>

<i>We were all thinking,</i>

{\an8}<i>"You have to respect the mountain.</i>
<i>Sometimes it doesn't want you up there."</i>

{\an8}<i>The atmosphere was super depressive.</i>

832

859
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:27,400
<i>The climbers who had tried to summit,</i>

<i>[Nims] Yeah, I got that.</i>

863
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:39,640

867
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:48,880
<i>Of course, I never said</i>

868
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:52,120
<i>As a leader,</i>

875
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:12,720

<i>[indistinct chatter]</i>

877
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:26,320
<i>[Klára] </i>There was this friend of mine,

<i>saying, "Klára,</i>
<i>it's 50% chance we make it,</i>

<i>and it's 50% chance we die."</i>

880
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:38,320
<i>And hearing that as a woman</i>
<i>and as a mother of two children,</i>

881
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:42,840
<i>I'm thinking,</i>
<i>"What the hell am I doing here?"</i>

<i>[speaking indistinctly]</i>

883

<i>But then Nims said,</i>
<i>"Don't listen to the others."</i>

884
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:55,400
<i>"You need to take chances,</i>
<i>and you need to take the risk sometimes</i>

<i>in order to make things happen</i>
<i>for yourself."</i>

886
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:03,200
<i>That was the moment</i>
<i>when I realized, "Damn it."</i>

<i>"I will blame myself</i>

<i>[Madison] </i>Above Camp 4 on K2,

892

01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,720
<i>You could have your whole team swept away.</i>

01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:51,680
<i>We thought there's no chance</i>
<i>anyone will summit K2 this season,</i>

898
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:55,800
<i>but Nims had</i>
<i>so much riding on this project,</i>

899
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:59,040
<i>he was ready</i>
<i>to go up there and risk his life</i>

900

<i>and give it his best shot.</i>

901
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:17,480

911

01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:25,440
<i>[in Nepali] </i>I have climbed
{\an8}a lot of mountains in my life,

963
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:27,680
{\an8}<i>but this is my best moment.</i>

964
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,240
{\an8}<i>[indistinct chatter]</i>

965
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:34,720
<i>So many people</i>
<i>had told us we couldn't do it,</i>

966
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,440
<i>which motivated us more.</i>

967
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:42,360
<i>Ten down, including K2, five to go.</i>

968
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:43,680
<i>No, four to go.</i>

969
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:47,480
<i>-Make that correction, yeah? Four to go.</i>
<i>-[climbers laughing]</i>

970
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:49,560
<i>[upbeat music playing]</i>

971
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:53,160
<i>Thirty-six hours later…</i>

972
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:58,240
<i>…we were on the summit of Broad Peak.</i>

973
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:03,520
{\an8}<i>We are here, myself, Mingma David</i>

974
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,840
{\an8}<i>and Halung Dorchi Sherpa.</i>

975
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:10,360
{\an8}<i>This will mark the end of second phase.</i>

976
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:17,960
<i>We had summited</i>
<i>the five highest mountains of Pakistan</i>

977
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:20,120
<i>in just 23 days.</i>

978
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,680
<i>I felt like I could do anything.</i>

979
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,480
<i>-[Nims] Yes! Let's go!</i>
<i>-[Mingma] Okay!</i>

980
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,120
<i>[Nims]</i> I am the Usain Bolt
of 8,000 meters.

981
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:31,640
<i>Success!</i>

982
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:33,760
<i>No one can defeat me.</i>

983
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:36,360
<i>[laughs]</i>

984
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:54,840
<i>[Suchi] </i>During the gap
between Phase 2 and 3,

985
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,120
<i>Mum's health went downhill.</i>

986
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:03,560
<i>She had a heart attack.</i>

987
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:12,000
<i>[Kamal] </i>The doctor said
she can go at any time.

988
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:14,760
<i>It would be wise for you</i>
<i>to call all your family here.</i>

989
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:27,360
{\an8}<i>[in Nepali] Our options are</i>
<i>either do surgery or make her stable.</i>

990
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:33,640
{\an8}<i>A lot of people</i>
<i>have died on the surgery table.</i>

991
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:37,760
<i>From what I understand, Mum's chances</i>
<i>of being revived are completely zero.</i>

992
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:46,560
<i>[Suchi] </i>Eventually, the doctor said
we can't operate on her

993
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:49,000
<i>because she is so vulnerable.</i>

994
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,200
<i>Nims is so close to his mum.</i>

995
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:57,800
<i>If anything happens, the project is over.</i>

996
01:19:58,720 --> 01:19:59,840
<i>[horns honking]</i>

997
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:06,880
<i>[Nims] </i>It was so tough.

998
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:11,920
<i>I just felt like I'm doing</i>
<i>this inspiring, positive endeavor.</i>

999
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:16,400
<i>But as a son, I felt I had failed.</i>

1000
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:24,880
<i>I just said,</i>
<i>"Don't lose your heart," you know?</i>

1001
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:28,480
<i>"She is proud of you."</i>

1002
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,560
{\an8}<i>[indistinct chatter]</i>

1003
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:57,440
<i>It was a miracle.</i>

1004
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:01,360
<i>She survived.</i>

1005
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:07,480
<i>[in Nepali] May God</i>
<i>always protect you, my son.</i>

1006
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:11,000
<i>Mum, don't worry about me.</i>

1007
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:13,960
<i>-Continue to be more successful, my son.</i>
<i>-Mmm.</i>

1008
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:16,880
<i>May the world recognize you.</i>

1009
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:19,760
<i>I'm going to summit the mountains, Mum.</i>

1010
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:21,560
<i>[soft music playing]</i>

1011
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,240
<i>[in English] </i>I was touched so emotionally.

1012
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:36,640
<i>I have another chance.</i>

1013
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:43,920
<i>My mum said to me,</i>
<i>"Nims, complete this for me."</i>

1014
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:57,600
<i>[laughing and whooping]</i>

1015
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:08,960
<i>[Suchi] </i>The plan for Phase 3
was to summit Manaslu in Nepal first.

1016
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:15,040
<i>And then to enter Tibet</i>
<i>to climb Cho Oyu and Shishapangma.</i>

1017
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:19,400
<i>But nothing goes</i>
<i>as planned on the mountains</i>

1018
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:21,480
<i>which we should have known by then.</i>

1019
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:26,080
<i>[drumming and chanting]</i>

1020
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:35,200
<i>[drumming and chanting continues]</i>

1021
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:43,160
<i>[Nims] </i>We got two bits of bad news.

1022
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:50,080
<i>One, my permit request</i>
<i>for Shishapangma has been rejected.</i>

1023
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:52,520
<i>[dramatic music playing]</i>

1024
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:58,600
<i>The Chinese government were saying</i>
<i>the mountain is closed for this year.</i>

1025
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:04,680
<i>Problem two,</i>
<i>I was in the base camp of Manaslu,</i>

1026
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:07,760
<i>but Cho Oyu will be closed next week.</i>

1027
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,200
<i>I had to move fast.</i>

1028
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:13,080
<i>There's no time for stopping, brother.</i>

1029
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:17,360
<i>We're heading back to catch our flight,</i>

1030
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:20,120
<i>so that we can enter Tibet</i>
<i>by tomorrow evening.</i>

1031
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:28,160
<i>[Suchi] </i>Most people
normally plan for one expedition,

1032
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:31,080
<i>but here we're planning for 14.</i>

1033
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:34,880
<i>The logistics were very stressful.</i>

1034
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:38,160
<i>[Nims] The vehicle can't go</i>
<i>any further than this.</i>

1035
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:40,440
<i>[dramatic music continues]</i>

1036
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:45,160
<i>The deadline is running out of our hands,</i>

1037
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:49,000
<i>and I could see</i>
<i>how much pressure he's going through.</i>

1038
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:52,280
<i>[horn honking]</i>

1039
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:57,160
<i>[music continues]</i>

1040
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:05,320
<i>So, we are</i>
<i>at the Cho Oyu base camp. [exhales]</i>

1041
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:09,800
<i>[Suchi]</i> We were all worried about him.

1042
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:34,680
{\an8}<i>Yeah, it's an absolute pleasure</i>
<i>to be here on the summit of Cho Oyu.</i>

1043
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:39,440
<i>And, uh, in few days' time,</i>
<i>I'll give you the summit of Manaslu.</i>

1044
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:41,320
<i>Whoo!</i>

1045
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:46,000
<i>[dramatic music playing]</i>

1046
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:03,040
<i>[Suchi] </i>For Nims as well,
behind the scenes,

1047
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:05,240
<i>his mum was on his mind.</i>

1048
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:08,680
<i>It was a constant worry for him.</i>

1049
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:21,080
<i>[Nims] </i>Standing on top of Manaslu,
{\an8}I was obviously happy.

1050
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:24,040
{\an8}<i>But inside my chest…</i>

1051
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:30,720
<i>I was feeling that</i>
<i>it could be my last mountain.</i>

1052
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:51,560
<i>[Chin] </i>The one thing at this point
that could stop Nims from finishing…

1053
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:54,840
<i>was access to</i>
<i>the final mountain, Shishapangma.</i>

1054
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:01,160
<i>To any normal person,</i>

1055
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:04,960
<i>the Chinese government</i>
<i>giving you a hard no</i>

1056
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:10,040
<i>would be a moment to, you know, walk away.</i>

1057
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,800
<i>[in Nepali] They have said no climbers</i>
<i>are allowed on Shishapangma.</i>

1058
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:19,240
<i>But if it goes through</i>
<i>a Nepali government official,</i>

1059
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:20,440
<i>they may allow it.</i>

1060
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:27,760
<i>[Suchi] </i>Nims was non-stop
meeting politicians.

1061
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:32,920
<i>What can we do for humanity?</i>
<i>To prove that power of possibility.</i>

1062
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:35,640
<i>The former prime minister.</i>

1063
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:41,640
<i>Sir, as a Nepali, I thought</i>
<i>of this project as this country's project.</i>

1064
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:44,720
<i>But this could take four,</i>
<i>five, six months.</i>

1065
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:46,960
<i>[Nims in English] This is for everyone</i>
<i>here in this room.</i>

1066
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,480
<i>Everyone who is in Nepal.</i>

1067
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:53,920
<i>I'm no one compared to the power of China.</i>

1068
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,200
<i>[camera clicking]</i>

1069
01:26:57,720 --> 01:27:00,360
<i>But I was never gonna get fazed by that.</i>

1070
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:08,560
<i>I took two routes.</i>

1071
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:12,200
<i>One, the political process.</i>

1072
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:15,240
<i>The second was…</i>

1073
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:19,920
<i>I asked my followers for help.</i>

1074
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:33,960
<i>[Suchi] </i>Many wrote
to the Chinese government.

1075
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:36,160
{\an8}<i>[dramatic music continues]</i>

1076
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:42,040
{\an8}<i>From all over the world.</i>

1077
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:06,320
<i>[Nims] </i>I also started to get support
from the mountaineering community.

1078
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:12,120
{\an8}<i>-Yeah! Hey, Nims. Conrad.</i>
<i>-Jimmy. [laughs]</i>

1079
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:14,440
{\an8}<i>Shout-out to you, man.</i>
<i>You've got Shishapangma.</i>

1080
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:16,160
{\an8}<i>You're the man. Crush it.</i>

1081
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:19,240
{\an8}<i>It is a project not only for himself,</i>

1082
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:22,680
<i>but for Nepal,</i>
<i>for the Sherpas, for mountaineering.</i>

1083
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:31,840
<i>[Suchi] </i>The Chinese government
saw the whole world is supporting him.

1084
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:38,120
<i>[Nims] </i>Finally, the news came through that

1085
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:41,680
<i>the Chinese were opening</i>
<i>the mountain for me and my team.</i>

1086
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:45,680
<i>One mountain to go.</i>

1087
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:48,200
<i>Let's do this.</i>

1088
01:28:58,480 --> 01:28:59,800
<i>[soft music playing]</i>

1089
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:04,520
<i>[dramatic music playing]</i>

<i>[crows cawing]</i>

1091
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:07,960
<i>This is my last mountain.</i>

1092
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:13,080
<i>Let's take it slow.</i>

1093
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:16,960
<i>Let's make it really easy.</i>

1094
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,200
<i>That was the plan. </i>[chuckles]

1095
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,800
<i>[wind gusting]</i>

1096
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:31,200
<i>[screams]</i>

1097
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:34,040
<i>[in Nepali] What's up with this weather?</i>

1098
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,800
<i>Gesman. Gesman, brother.</i>

1099
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:42,840
<i>We need to tie the ropes.</i>

1100
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:50,880
<i>[in English] </i>It was horrendous.

1101
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:57,280
<i>[in Nepali] </i>{\an8}We were really worried.

1102
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:03,600
{\an8}<i>No one had climbed</i>
<i>Shishapangma since 2014.</i>

1103
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:07,640
<i>[rumbling]</i>

1104
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:12,040
<i>[Nims in English] It's an avalanche.</i>

1105
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:19,200
<i>[in Nepali] </i>Who is my team?
{\an8}Can we do this?

1106
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:23,040
{\an8}<i>These are the questions you ask yourself</i>
<i>in this kind of situation.</i>

1107
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:34,720
<i>But the project had become our dream,</i>

1108
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:37,160
<i>and we were focused</i>
<i>on making it come true.</i>

1109
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:46,440
<i>[dramatic music playing]</i>

1110
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:57,680
<i>[Nims in English] </i>In life,
you have to keep doing what you believe.

1111
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:09,120
<i>You have to ask yourself,</i>
<i>do you really want this from your heart?</i>

1112
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:18,560
<i>Is it for the self-glory?</i>

1113
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:22,680
<i>Or is it for something bigger?</i>

1114
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:31,280
<i>Sometimes, the idea that you come up with</i>

1115
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:33,440
<i>may seem impossible</i>
<i>to the rest of the world,</i>

1116
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:36,960
<i>but that doesn't mean</i>
<i>it's impossible to you.</i>

1117
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:39,600
<i>[music increases in tempo]</i>

1118
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:51,400
<i>And if you can inspire</i>
<i>one or two people in a good way,</i>

1119
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,080
